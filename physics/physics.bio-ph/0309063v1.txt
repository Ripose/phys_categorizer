RNA secondary structures of increasing complexity are
probed combining single molecule stretching experiments
and stochastic unfolding/refolding simulations. We ﬁnd that
force-induced unfolding pathways cannot usually be inter-
pretated by solely invoking successive openings of native he-
lices. Indeed, typical force-extension responses of complex
RNA molecules are largely shaped by stretching-induced,
long-lived intermediates including non-native helices. This
is ﬁrst shown for a set of generic structural motifs found in
larger RNA structures, and then for Escherichia coli’s 1540-
base long 16S ribosomal RNA, which exhibits a surprisingly
well-structured and reproducible unfolding pathway under
mechanical stretching. Using out-of-equilibrium stochas-
tic simulations, we demonstrate that these experimental re-
sults reﬂect the slow relaxation of RNA structural rearrange-
ments. Hence, micromanipulations of single RNA molecules
probe both their native structures and long-lived intermedi-
ates, so-called “kinetic traps”, thereby capturing –at the sin-
gle molecular level– the hallmark of RNA folding/unfolding
dynamics.

Introduction

Recent developments of micromechanical experiments on single
biomolecules have provided structural insights into alternative struc-
tures of DNA[1, 2, 3, 4] and mechanical properties of proteins[5, 6, 7].
In principle, such techniques could also provide new tools to probe
RNA structures which remain by and large refractory to many crys-
tallization schemes. However, this prospect requires one to relate me-
chanically induced unfolding pathways to RNA structural features. Al-
though it could be done successfully for small RNA structures by solely
invoking successive openings of native helices[8], probing more com-
plex RNA structures by mechanical force is expected to involve non-
native structural rearrangements of the initial secondary structure upon
stretching[9, 10, 11]. Local rearrangements, such as the formation of
simple stem-loops, occur quite fast (< 1 ms) under low pulling force
(or in the absence of force) and the number of possible hairpins (with
small loop) is proportional to the length of stretched region of the
RNA molecule. Thus, alternative hairpins, not present on the initial
structure, should inevitably form under partial stretching of long RNA
molecules (e.g., > 1000 nucleotides). Conversely, more global rear-
rangements, which involve the coordonated removal and formation of
different sets of helices, might occur much more slowly (e.g., after a few

minutes)[12, 13]. Hence, under typical pulling rates (i.e., full extension
within a few seconds), most stretching experiments likely occur under
out-of-equilibrium conditions and should exhibit unfolding/refolding
hysteresis curves.

To study the full potential and limitations of these micromechanical
techniques so as to probe complex RNA structures, we have combined
single RNA molecule stretching experiments and out-of-equilibrium
stochastic simulations. Three small artiﬁcial structures, M1, M2 and
M3 (Fig 1), representing prototypes for the main structural modules
of larger RNA secondary structures, were ﬁrst designed and studied in
details. The mechanical response of E. coli’s 1540-base long 16S ribo-
somal RNA was then studied using the same experimental setup and a
somewhat simpliﬁed numerical approach. The generic structural mo-
tifs M1, M2 and M3, correspond to three different arrangements of two
15 base pair long helices consisting almost exclusively of either GC or
AU base pairs, Fig 1. M1 corresponds to two adjacent stem-loops with
respect to the external single strand joining the molecule ends. By con-
trast, M2 and M3 present the same nested organisation with either the
strong (GC) helix or the weaker (AU) helix connected to the external
single strand.

The 5’ and 3’ ends of either these small RNA motifs or E. coli’s
16S rRNA were hybridized to two pUC19 dsDNA extensions labelled,
respectively, with biotin and digoxygenin (see Materials and Methods).
The force-extension experiments were then done by grafting the ends
of these extended molecular constructs between the antidigoxygenin
coated glass surface of a capillary and a micrometer size silica bead
coated with strepavidin. The capillary was moved by a piezo-electric
stage (50 to 300 nm/s) and the resulting force exerted by the molecule
on to the bead was measured with an optical tweezer.

curves (0.1 pN/nm).

Fig 2. A histogram of the rupture force and a set of unfolding and re-
folding force-extension curves are shown for each motif on Fig 2A and

respond to stochastic ﬂuctuations between either successive stretchings
on the same molecule or different experiments on equivalent molecules.
A comparison of the different rupture force histograms and the cor-
responding unfolding curves (black on Fig 2B) shows that M1 and
M2 present very similar unfolding responses with two sequential drops
or inﬂexion regions around 11 ± 3 pN and 22 ± 3 pN, whereas M3
presents a single and larger force drop at about 22 ± 3 pN. These values
are in very good agreement with ref.[14] although these latter experi-
ments concern the opening of DNA hairpins. For M1 and M2, these

results can be simply attributed to the ﬁrst opening of the weak (AU)
helix followed by the stronger (GC) helix at a higher applied force.
Indeed, the applied tension being uniformly distributed along the ex-
ternal single strand joining the molecules ends, the weaker (AU) helix
is expected to break ﬁrst on M2, while it should certainly do so by
construction on M1. Besides, by calibrating the stiffness of the optical
trap, both force drops on these curves can be converted into a distance
released by the molecule, taking into account the angular inclination
of the setup (30◦ to 40◦). This corresponds to the expected 20 nm in
both cases. Substracting the net free-energy contribution stored in the
stretched single strand[15], we ﬁnd in term of pairing energy, around
1.7 kT/bp for AU and 3 kT/bp for GC, in good agreement with known
parameters[16]. By contrast for M3, the strong (GC) helix shields the
weaker (AU) stem from the applied force and no signiﬁcant unzipping
is observed until the whole molecule suddenly unfolds at the critical
force to break GC stacking base pairs.

The refolding curves for M1 (blue) and M2 (red) show most often a
small hysteresis below the force drop associated with the strong (GC)
stem’s opening. For M2, a second small refolding hysteresis occurs also
usually below the force drop associated with the weaker (AU) stem’s
opening. By contrast, a much stronger hysteresis is systematically ob-
served for M3 (magenta), even at the lowest loading rate achieved,
3 pN/s. Moreover, in this case, the refolding event around 10 pN does
not usually fold back onto the initial stretching curve. This suggests
that the stretching of M3 involves long-lived intermediate structures
including non-native helices (see Fig 3 and next section on stochastic
simulations of small RNA motifs). Still, all three molecules eventually
fold back in their initial native structure after a few seconds, as shown
by the reproducibility of force extension curves in successive pulls on
the same molecule.

Stochastic unfolding/refolding simulations of small RNA motifs

We have performed stochastic simulations of

these out-of-
equilibrium unfolding/refolding experiments for the short M1, M2 and
M3 structural motifs. The heart of the numerical method, follow-
ing the approach detailed in[17], consists in simulating the stochas-
tic unfolding and refolding of helices not only present on the initial
RNA structure but also for all other helices which can possibly pair
on the RNA sequence of interest (see also RNA Kinefold server at
http://kinefold.u-strasbg.fr ). Common pseudoknots (i.e., helices in-
terior to loops) are also allowed following the structural modeling ap-
proach proposed in[17]. In addition, the region of the RNA structure
under direct mechanical tension (corresponding to the “on-net” back-
bone in[17]) is modelled as an inextensible wormlike chain with a 1.5
nm persistence length[2] and 0.7 nm/base contour length[18]. Stretch-
ing is induced by a slowly varying rigid constraint on the end-to-end
distance of the RNA-dsDNA-tweezer construct (rate ± 300 nm/s in
± 2 nm steps). It is also important to take into account the acquisi-
tion rate (300 Hz) and to model the statics and dynamics of the optical
tweezer trap, although time scale separation allows to consider that the
micromechanical setup responds to a slow time average of the fast RNA
dynamics, which corresponds to stochastic closing and opening of sin-
gle helices[17]. To avoid overﬁtting with non essential parameters, we
have simply modelled the trapped bead and the two dsDNA extensions
of the construct as an ideal spring with a slow viscous relaxation time
(1 ms) and an effective stiffness (typically 0.1 pN/nm) ﬁtted on the in-
dividual force extension curves.

The simulated force-extension responses for the M1, M2 and M3
motifs (Fig 2C) are in good agreement with the unfolding and refolding
experimental results (Fig 2B). In particular, they allow for the identi-
ﬁcation of likely intermediate structures involved in the refolding hys-
teresis, which primarily correspond to the formation of two non-native
helices originating from each strand of the strong (GC) helix, Fig 3.
The transition from these alternative helices back to the strong initial
(GC) stem is facilitated under high external force, hence the small hys-
teresis for M1 and M2. By contrast for M3, the transition can only
occur at a lower force after the weak (AU) stem has refolded and is,
therefore, slower, as observed experimentally. Note, the small experi-
mental differences in the hysteresis responses of M1 and M2 are well
reproduced on their simulated force-extension curves, suggesting that
elementary unfolding/refolding events are reliably captured by these
stochastic simulations devised to probe RNA molecular dynamics on
second to minute time scales. It should be emphasized that such long
time scale simulations could not be achieved for other molecules, such
as proteins, for which elementary unfolding/refolding transitions are
not so easily deﬁned and also much more frequent. For instance, the
best molecular dynamic simulations of proteins are currently limited to
around 100 ns[20].

The force-induced unfolding of these three generic structural mo-
tifs M1, M2 and M3, reveals the potential and limitations of single
molecule experiments to probe the main folded features of more com-
plex RNA structures. The comparison between M2 and M3’s force-
extension responses illustrates that the order of helix stability along a
single secondary structure branch can be readily identiﬁed, while the
bifurcation arrangements of helices or the presence of multibranched
loops are not so easily distinguished from single branches with in-
creasing helix stability (as in M1 versus M2). Moreover, the formation
of non-native rearrangements under stretching likely affects the force-
extension responses of most RNA structures (as for M3).

In this context, combining experimental and numerical approaches
to study RNA mechanical unfolding pathways seems promising insofar
as transient structural rearrangements (under stretching) are difﬁcult to
probe with traditional chemical or enzymatic techniques.

FIG. 4: Experimental unfolding of Escherichia coli’s 1540-base long
16S ribosomal RNA by mechanical stretching (rate 300nm/s). Colors
correspond to successive stretching rounds of the same molecule (re-
folding hysteresis are not shown for clarity). An increasing maximum
extension was applied at successive stretching/refolding rounds to avoid
early breakage by overstretching. As a result, the RNA molecule was
not entirely unfolded until the sixth stretching/refolding round. Force-
extension curves are slightly shifted vertically and horizontally to best
display the overall reproducibility between successive extensions. The
mechanical unfolding over the full extension range of the molecule
presents a characteristic unfolding plateau between 11 and 15pN. This
is the mechanical unfolding signature of E. coli’s 16S rRNA. The brown
curve (bottom) corresponds to the average of the colored curves above.

der stretching should ultimately smooth out the observed characteristics
completely by continuous adjustments to the applied constraint, assum-
ing that quasi-equilibrium stretching is achieved.

To investigate this issue and test whether large structures of biolog-
ically relevant RNA molecules are also amenable to convergent stud-
ies in both single molecule experiments and stochastic simulations, we
decided to study the mechanical unfolding of Escherichia coli’s 1540-
base long 16S ribosomal RNA.

Single molecule stretching experiments of E. coli 16S rRNA

The force-induced stretching of E. coli 16S ribosomal RNA was
studied using a similar molecular construct and micromechanical setup
as for the stretching of the small structural modules M1, M2 and M3
(see Materials and Methods). No ribosomal proteins which associate
to 16S rRNA to form the 30S subunit[21] of the ribosome[22] were in-
cluded for these stretching experiments. As the piezo stage is displaced,
the force begins to rise due to the elastic response of the DNA han-
dles. The results on Figs 4-5 show a well-structured and reproducible
unfolding pathway under mechanical stretching, in about 50% of the
tested constructs for which more than two unfolding/refolding rounds
could be performed before molecular breakage. In these cases (total 44
stretching curves), a ∼ 1 µm-long quasi plateau is observed around 11-
15 pN, with force ﬂuctuation amplitude of about 20%. This signal is the
signature of 16S rRNA unfolding by mechanical force. Other stretch-
ing curves exhibit somewhat more erratic behaviors, presumably due
to non-speciﬁc interactions of the construct with the glass surface of
the capillary (data not shown) Extension beyond the unfolding plateau
corresponds to the combined elastic response of the dsDNA handles
and the opened ssRNA molecule. Most refolding curves exhibit strong
hysteresis depending on stage velocity (50-300 nm/s).

On the other hand, for long RNA molecules (e.g., >1000 bases),
it has been argued[9, 10, 11] that such structural rearrangements un-

from the median line ﬁts are used to calcule the relative Spearman cor-
relation coefﬁcient rs [23] between unfolding curves (see text). In the
example shown, rs=60.5% which corresponds to a very good correla-
tion between the two experimental deviations relative to the median line
ﬁts. Evaluating, instead, absolute correlations between actual unfolding
responses (above curves) yields an even larger, yet less discriminating,
Spearman coefﬁcient rs=90%, due to the small positive slopes of both
unfolding plateaux.

molecule (Fig 4) and between independent unfolding curves from dif-
ferent 16S molecules (Fig 5) (i.e., different sample preparations and
different micromechanical experiments). The analysis is based on the
calculation of Spearman nonparametric correlation coefﬁcient rs [23]:
i (Si − ¯S)2)1/2, where
rs = ΣN
Ri, ¯R and Si, ¯S are chosen as the rank-ordered deviations and averages
from the median line ﬁts of the unfolding plateaux (Fig 6). Such relative
Spearman correlation coefﬁcient is much more sensitive to the speciﬁc
unfolding signals, as compared to the absolute Spearman correlation of
the actual unfolding curves which yields higher, yet less discriminating
correlation coefﬁcients (see Fig 6 for details).

i (Ri − ¯R)2ΣN

In the context of comparing 16S unfolding curves, we found that
this relative Spearman correlation coefﬁcients correspond to good cor-
relations above 50% and excellent ones above 70%, while |rs| <15%
reﬂects little or no correlation between unfolding pathways irrespec-
tive of the overall inclination of their unfolding plateaux. Stochastic
reproducibility between successive stretchings of the same molecule
is remarkably high (rs=75±4.6%, Fig 4) and still quite good between
unfolding curves of different 16S RNA (rs=53±9.1%, Fig 5) despites
inherent variations between different sample preparations and differ-
ent micromechanical experiments. For instance, correlation between
independent green and red unfolding curves on Fig 6 is: rs=60.5%,
while the correlation distributions of all independent curves of Fig 5
(colors) with their average unfolding response (black) is even higher:
rs=70±4.7%. See Table 1 for further correlation data and quantitative
comparison with stochastic simulations.

Before discussing the stochastic unfolding/refolding simulations of
16S rRNA, we want to emphasize that force ﬂuctuations from the
plateau median line cannot be attributed to dehybridization of the DNA
handles for the following reasons: i) we never recorded such signals on
simple pUC19 dimer without RNA insert (see Fig 1 inset). ii) experi-
ments done by other groups with the same infrared laser power have
preserved nucleic acids’ integrity[2, 24].
iii) recalling that we pull
on opposite DNA strands, the average force magnitude at which the
plateau appears is too low to originate from DNA denaturation[1, 2, 3].
Moreover, no torque is applied on the molecules using our optical
tweezer[4]. In addition, experimental force ﬂuctuations cannot corre-
spond to the unzipping of a long structureless double stranded RNA
molecules; an analysis based on G+C contents as in ref.[25] does not
account for the experimental signal, nor does a thermal equilibrium en-
ergy calculations.

Stochastic unfolding/refolding simulations of 16S ribosomal RNA

The unrestricted stochastic simulations discussed above to model the
mechanical unfolding and refolding of small structural motifs are nu-
merically unpractical in the case of much larger RNA structures like
those of ribosomal RNAs. Hence, we have made the following three
additional assumptions to study the force-induced stretching of E. coli’s
1540-base long 16S ribosomal RNA: i) the initial structure before me-
chanical stretching is assumed known from independent sources; ii)
Unfolding and (re)folding dynamics is restricted to the formed helices
under direct mechanical tension and to all potential helices that would
be under direct tension once formed. Hence, large scale structural re-
arrangements can only originate and propagate from helices directly
coupled to the applied mechanical tension, as expected under strong
stretching conditions; iii) For each intermediate structure along the un-
folding pathway, the actual base pair extent of each helix under direct
tension is not globally optimized to best ﬁt the end-to-end molecular ex-
tension imposed by the mechanical setup (this would become exponen-

Cross-correlations between unfolding curves in each simulation conditions and quantitative comparison with experiments are presented in Table 1
Red curves (see below) for the native structure (left) resemble most closely the experimental curves (brown from Fig 4 and black from Fig 5)
also plotted for comparison.
(Green): the stochastic simulation is restricted to the sole helices formed on the initial structure assuming, in addition, that those cannot refold

(Blue): the initial helices and some 1,500 additional stems longer than 3bp and containing the most stable stack (5’-GC/GC-3’) can form and
break stochastically during stretching.
(Magenta): all additional helices longer than 3bp and stronger than 15kT are also included; total: 6,500 helices.
(Red): all additional helices longer than 3bp and stronger than 10kT are also considered; total: 18,000 helices. The lowest red curve corresponds
to the average of four independent stretching simulations starting either from the native structure (left) or the control structure (right).

tension, is usually very good as long as there are few mutually incom-
patible helices competing for the same bases, a typical situation under
strong mechanical stretching. Overall, we found that these restricted
stochastic simulations give virtually identical results for the small M1,
M2 and M3 motifs (results not shown).

Adopting this heuristic numerical approach for the bare E. coli

16S rRNA, we simulated the force-induced unfolding pathway
starting either from the known native secondary structure inside
from a low free-energy structure pre-
the ribosome[21, 22] or
dicted by mfold, referred at, hereafter, as the “control structure”
(http://bioinfo.math.rpi.edu/∼mfold/). The comparison between the
force-extension responses of these two structures was primarily in-
tended to probe the stochastic simulation’s sensitivity to the initial

structure. In both cases, the role of helices not initially formed on the
starting structure was studied, by allowing a variable number of he-
lices to form and break during different stochastic simulations. The
results in Fig 7 and Table 1 show that a reasonable agreement exists
between the experimental measurements (black and brown curves) and
the simulated force-extension responses starting from the known native
structure, when all helices longer than 3bp and more stable than 10kT
(i.e., 6 kcal/mol) are included a priori in the simulations (red curves).
This demonstrates that some of these 18,000 different non-native he-
lices play a signiﬁcant structural role along the unfolding pathway.
More quantitatively, cross-correlations amonsgt 4 independent simu-
lated stretching curves (i.e., about 3 weeks of CPU on a 1.2GHz PC)
reveal a good stochastic reproducibility in these simulations starting
from the native structure and including about 18,000 possible helices:
rs=57± 3.8%. This is comparable to observed variations between ex-
perimental unfolding curves (see Table 1). Then comparing these indi-
vidual simulations with the experiment average curve (black curve on
Fig 5 from 4 independent experiments), we obtain a signiﬁcative corre-
lation coefﬁcient: rs=47±8.8%, while correlating the experiment aver-
age (black) directly to the simulation average clearly reﬂects common
features between the experimental response and the simulated unfold-
ing pathway curve starting from the native structure: rs=55%. In ad-
dition, restricting simulations to the 6,500 possible helices longer than
3bp and stronger than 15kT (magenta curves) or including even fewer
helices (blue and green curves), produces marked differences on the
simulated stretching curves (Table 1 shows lower averages and larger
standard deviations for the simulation stochastic reproducibility and for
the correlations with experimental response). By contrast, equivalent
stochastic simulations starting from the control structure (Fig 7) present
clearly distinct results from experimental observations, i.e., |rs| <15%
(even for a large number of possible helices included in the simula-
tions). The fact that the stochastic reproducibility of these control sim-
ulations happens to decrease with the number of possible helices taken
into account (Table 1) reﬂects the concomitant decrease of speciﬁc un-
folding signal relative to the median line ﬁt of the plateau (Fig 7). A de-
creasing signal over noise ratio naturally leads to a lower reproducibil-
ity of the simulated curves. The same trend is also visible between blue

and magenta curves for simulations starting from the native structure.

Fig 8 compares more closely a simulated force-extension response of
the known native structure (red) and an experimental stretching curve
(black). Again, both simple visual comparison and calculation of their
correlation coefﬁcient as above (here rs=61%) strongly suggest that the
experimentally probed structure shares, indeed, more structural features
with the actual native structure than with the control structure (Fig 7),
in spite of the absence of ribosomal proteins in these single molecule
stretching experiments of E. coli’s 16S rRNA. Analysing the unfolding
pathway during the simulated force-extension response reveals that the
main predicted unfolding events (corresponding to abrupt force drops
on the red curve) are either related to the cooperative opening of several
native helices (as in the unfolding of M3) or to the simultaneous rear-
rangements of mainly non-native helices leading to a stepwise increase
of the predicted extension of the molecule along the direction of pulling
(violet curve). This is illustrated with 12 successive snapshots of inter-
mediate structures along the stretching-induced unfolding pathway. In
particular, the 3’ major (III) and 3’ minor (IV) domains are shown to
break and partially rearrange at the start of the stretching plateau (in-
termediates 2 to 4) while the 5’ domain (I), partially unfolded between
intermediates 4 and 5, remains then largely intact until most other na-
tive and non-native helices have been opened under stretching (inter-
mediate 11). Finally, the central domain (II) exhibits a more distributed
unfolding fate which extends from intermediates 1 to 10. Hence, me-
chanical breaking of the native structure does not occur through suc-
cessive openings of entire native domains. Instead, native helices con-
tribute to a more complex (yet largely reproducible) sequence of force
drops, reﬂecting also the rearrangements of non-native helices. For in-
stance, this is the case for the recorded signal between intermediates 8
and 10 which is largely caused by successive rearrangements of weak
non-native helices between 10kT and 15kT (compare magenta and red
curves for the native structure on Fig 7 and experimental and simulated
curves on Fig 8). In retrospect and more generally, these results un-
derline the possible pitfalls in attempting to assign speciﬁc structural
features of large RNA molecules by studying the mechanical unfolding
of their independently folded domains separately.

Discussion

We have measured the force range to unfold RNA secondary struc-
tures by mechanical stretching experiments. It extends from 10 pN for
AU rich to 25 pN for GC rich regions in agreement with intermediate
values reported for intermediate G+C contents. We also showed that
non-native rearrangements have a large inﬂuence on force-extension
measurements of complex RNA structures, as in the case of E. coli’s
16S rRNA presented here.

Interestingly, this force-induced unfolding process of the bare 16S
rRNA’s domains seems to mirror, only in reverse order, the predominant
5’ to 3’ polarity of the in vitro assembly of 16S rRNA into 30S ribo-
somal subunits[27]. From a more general perspective, the high repro-
ducibility of the mechanical unfolding curves shown here (e.g., Figs 4-
5) sharply contrasts with the multiple folding and misfolding pathways
usually experienced by RNA molecules of this size during thermal re-
naturation. This reﬂects the fact that unfolding/refolding pathways un-
der mechanical constraint solely explore a restricted number of pos-
sible intermediate structures, as compared to unconstrained denatura-
tion/renaturation folding experiments. In other words, single molecule
unfolding and refolding experiments under mechanical control probe
particular, well-deﬁned pathways due to the slowly varying external
constraint applied onto the ends of the RNA molecule.
In addition,
we found that the overall unfolding curves did not critically depend on
the rate of pulling used (typically 300 nm/s); for instance, imposing

an extension rate twice as fast or twice as slow did not signiﬁcantly
modify the force-extension curves (data not shown). In retrospect, this
restricted set of unfolding pathways and their relative insensitivity to the
precise values of external parameters also explain why we could simu-
late these force-induced unfolding pathways starting from a given sec-
ondary structure, while predicting such 1540-nucleotide initial structure
a priori is still beyond the current limitations of secondary structure
prediction algorithms.

Despite clear similarities, the agreement between simulated and ex-
perimental force-extension responses in Fig 8 is uneven. In fact, vari-
ations between predicted (red) and measured (black) curves might re-
ﬂect real differences between the probed structure and the actual na-
tive secondary structure inside the ribosome[21, 22] used here as the
intial structure in the simulations. In particular, deviations at the begin-
ning of the stretching plateau might originate from alternative base pair
(re)folding of the 3’ major domain (III) due to the absence of essential
ribosomal proteins (e.g., as s7[28]) and Mg2+ ions. Moreover, the rel-
atively short time scales (few seconds) of these stretching-induced un-
folding/refolding experiments might not be sufﬁciently long to let 16S
rRNA ﬁnd its lowest free energy structure between successive pulls.

These results illustrate what should be expected, in general, when
RNA secondary structures are probed by mechanical force. Strong he-
lices resist until their breaking exposes weaker regions, which are un-
able to withstand such high forces. This leads to the unfolding of a
signiﬁcant domain with a concomitant force drop. A fraction of the
unpaired bases then typically reform different helices, which compen-
sate, in part, for the sudden relaxation of the mechanical tension. Yet,

force-extension responses are not completely smoothed out, as initially
suspected[9, 10, 11], by these local rearrangements. Instead, they re-
veal the slow dynamics of large scale cooperative changes in complex
RNA structures. Tertiary interactions, likely marginal here due to the
absence of Mg2+ ions, are expected to strengthen the unfolding coop-
erativity between interacting domains and, concomitantly, increase the
reformation of non-native helices upon stretching.

Local rearrangements of RNA molecules, similar to those reported
here, likely occur in vivo as well, in particular, during translation when
large domains of messenger RNAs become unfolded upstream of the
ribosome. In fact, the inﬂuence of long-lived intermediate structures
is likely ubiquitous to the RNA folding problem itself, as slow struc-
tural rearrangements are known to occur in the context of both in vitro
and in vivo RNA folding processes[12, 13]. New experimental tools
are needed to better understand the strategies of RNA molecules in
circumventing such kinetic traps (for instance through speciﬁc inter-
actions with ions or proteins[29], through RNA chaperones[13] or co-
transcriptional encoded folding pathways[17]).

By exploring RNA structure energy landscapes[30], micromanipu-
lations combined with appropriate stochastic simulations can help ad-
dress such questions, reﬂecting both structural and metastability fea-
tures of single RNA molecules.

Added note:

Onoa et al[31] have recently reported experimental results on the
mechanical unfolding of the L-21 derivative of Tetrahymena ther-
mophila ribozyme, a 390-nucleotide catalytic RNA. By contrast with
the present study which strictly focuses on the RNA secondary struc-
ture level (no Mg2+ added), Onoa et al primarily investigate the tertiary
fold of this selfsplicing ribozyme in the presence of Mg2+. A variety of
hysteresis responses to the applied force is presented for various parts
of the molecule or in the presence of speciﬁc antisense oligos. A direct
correlation between Mg2+-dependent unfolding events and the opening
of speciﬁc native helices is proposed.

Materials and Methods

Sample displacement: Sample displacement is driven and monitored
by a nanometer resolution piezoelectric stage with capacitive position
sensor (P530-3, Physik Instrument). The piezoelectric stage position is
controlled and monitored by a 0-10V voltage.

Optical tweezer: The optical tweezer consists of a Nd:Yag infra-red
laser beam (TOPAZ, SpectraPhysics) focussed inside the capillary by a
1.3 N.A. x100 objective (Zeiss). The laser is always set at full power
(2.5 W) and the stiffness of the trap is controlled by the amplitude of an
acoustic wave generated by an acousto-optic modulator (A-A) placed
right after the laser head. The experiments described here were per-
formed with a 50% attenuation of the laser intensity, which sets the op-
tical trap stiffness around 7×10−5 N/m. The bead displacement from
the laser beam focus point is measured as follows: after passing through
the sample, the bead diffused light is collected by a 0.6 N.A. x40 objec-
tive (Zeiss). The objective back focal plane is imaged by a lense of 40
mm focal length onto a two-quadrant photodetector (S5980, Hamma-
matsu). The whole experiment setup is mounted on an invar table so as
to minimize thermal position drift. The photodiode electric currents IA
and IB are converted into voltage and ampliﬁed by a home made am-
pliﬁer. The voltage difference VA − VB which is proportionnal to the
distance of the bead away from the trap center is further ampliﬁed and
ﬁltered at 300 Hz by low noise ampliﬁer (SR-50, Stanford Research In-
strument). The total light intensity that is collected by the x40 objective
measured by the voltage sum VA + VB is also ampliﬁed.

belled pUC 19 (bottom). Blue: pUC 19 DNA; Yellow: ssDNA oligos;
Green: RNA insert.

Data acquisition: The monitoring voltage coming out of the piezoelec-
tric driver, the voltage difference VA −VB and the voltage sum VA +VB
coming out of the low noise ampliﬁer are each directed into a separate
channel of an acquisition board (ATMIO-16X, National Instrument).
The driving voltage of the piezoelectric stage is generated by the same
board. The acquisition rate is 300 Hz which sets the duration of the
stretching/relaxing experiment around 10-20 seconds.

Calibration: The fourier power spectrum of a free bead inside the
trap follows a lorentzian law as expected for brownian ﬂuctuations.
Fitting this curve with two parameters provides both the trap stiff-
ness and the voltage/distance conversion factor.
In the case of a
pulling experiment, these two parameters are used to convert the ra-
tio (VA − VB)/(VA + VB) directly into piconewtons. The maximum
force that can be measured with our setup is 60 pN. The bead position
resolution inside the trap is ± 5 nm which sets the force resolution at
± 0.4 pN. The bead is captured at about 500-1000 nm from the capil-
lary interior surface. The pUC19 dimer contour length is 1742 nm (0.33
nm/pb). The geometry imposes to displace the piezo stage by 48.8-56
nm and 985-1108 nm to completely unfolded the small RNA motifs and
16S rRNA, respectively.

Molecule synthesis and functionalization: RNA molecules were
synthesized by in vitro ”run off” transcription of EcorV linearized
DNA plasmids. These plasmids were constructed by inserting DNA
oligomers (IBA GmBh) starting with a T7 promotor region inside the
BamHI-PstI region of pUC19. The RNA sequence was ﬂanked by 12
nucleotides at both extremities to allow for the ligation with the double-
stranded DNA arm extensions. In the case of 16S rRNA, the gene was
isolated by PCR from pKK3535 plasmid (courtesy of K. Lieberman
and H.F. Noller). It was cut by BstEII-BclI and then inserted in pUC19
together with oligomers carrying a T7 promotor with the DNA arm ex-
tensions and the complementary ends of the 16S sequence. The recon-
structed plasmids were produced in competent DH5 alpha bacteria and
were extracted and puriﬁed using Jetstar puriﬁcation kit. They were
further sequenced. Due to the small length of RNA molecules, there
were extended with digoxygenin or biotin labelled dsDNA at, respec-
tively, the 3’ and 5’ ends to enable grafting between the capilary glass
surface and the silica bead. In practice, DNA oligomers (Fig 9) were
ﬁrst ligated to Pst I restricted digoxygenin labelled pUC19 to yield a
12-nucleotide 3’ extension complementary to the RNA 3’ end. Then,
the DNA/RNA hybridization and ligation protocol was the following:
RNA was heated to 90◦C for 5 minutes then quenched on ice. It was
incubated with the former prepared pUC19 (molar ratio 100/1) at 70◦C
for 20 minutes and then slowly cooled (≪0.6◦C/min) to 16◦C. At this
temperature, T4 DNA ligase and buffer were added and the ligation re-
action was carried over 4 hours at 16◦C. The band corresponding to

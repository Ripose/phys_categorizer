The so called long range correlation properties of DNA sequences are studied using the variance
analyses of the density distribution of a single or a group of nucleotides in a model independent way.
This new method which was suggested earlier has been applied to extract slope parameters that
characterize the correlation properties for several intron containing and intron less DNA sequences.
An important aspect of all the DNA sequences is the properties of complimentarity by virtue of which
any two complimentary distributions (like GA is complimentary to T C or G is complimentary to
AT C) have identical ﬂuctuations at all scales although their distribution functions need not be
identical. Due to this complimentarity, the famous DNA walk representation whose statistical
interpretation is still unresolved is shown to be a special case of the present formalism with a
density distribution corresponding to a purine or a pyrimidine group. Another interesting aspect
of most of the DNA sequences is that the factorial moments as a function of length exceed unity
around a region where the variance versus length in a log-log plot shows a bending. This is a
pure phenomenological observation which is found for several DNA sequences with a few exception.
Therefore, this length scale has been used as an approximate measure to exclude the bending regions
from the slope analyses. The asymmetries in the nucleotide contents or the patchy structure as a
possible origin of the long range correlations has also been investigated.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently, there has been considerable interest in the ﬁnding of long range correlations in genomic DNA sequences [1].
A DNA sequence is a chain of sites, each occupied by either a purine (Adenine and Guanine) or a pyrimidine (Cytocyine
and Thymine) group. For mathematical modeling, the DNA sequence might be considered as a string of symbols
(G, A, T and C) whose correlation structure can be characterized completely by all possible base-base correlation
functions or their corresponding power spectra. Diﬀerent techniques including mutual information functions and
power spectra analyses [1–9], auto correlation [10–12], DNA walk representation [13–20], wavelet analysis [21,22]
and Zipf analysis [23] were used for statistical analyses of DNA sequences. But despite the eﬀort spent, it is still
an open question whether the long range correlation properties are diﬀerent for protein coding (exonic) and non
coding (intronic, intergenemic) sequences [24]. One more fundamental ground, there is still continuing debate as to
whether the reported long range correlations really mean a lack of independence at long distances or simply reﬂect
the patchiness (bias in nucleotide composition) of DNA sequences. There have been attempts to eliminate local
patchiness using methods such as min-max [13], detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) [24,25] and wavelet analysis
[21]. In spite of its success in modeling the long range correlations observed in DNA sequences, as indicated by the
power law increase in the variance and the inverse power law spectrum [5,9], the problem of the correct statistical
interpretation of DNA walk is still unresolved and is attracting the attention of an increasing number of investigators.
Since approaches based on diﬀerent models predict diﬀerent correlation structure, there is no unique measure of the
degree of correlation in DNA sequences. Therefore, it is very important to investigate the correlations and extract
the power law exponent α rather in a model independent way so that the interpretation of the data including the
theoretical analysis becomes more meaningful. There is another confusion related to this study is the absence of a
clear deﬁnition of the term ”long range”. Clearly, what is considered to be long is relative to what is considered
to be short. To over come some of these problems, recently we have suggested a new method [26] to measure the
degree of correlations using the variance analysis of the density distribution of a single or a group of nucleotides. We
have also suggested a way to ﬁnd out an approximate length scale above which all DNA sequences show strong long
range correlations irrespective of their intron contents while below this, the correlation is relatively weak. Further,
the density distribution which is nearly Gaussian at short distances shows signiﬁcant deviations from the Gaussian
statistics at large distances. In this paper, we present the details of the analyses and also extract the correlation
parameter α for several intron containing and intronless sequences.

II. DENSITY DISTRIBUTION AND FACTORIAL MOMENTS:

In the present method, we build the frequency spectrum of a single or a group of nucleotides by dividing the DNA

sequence into many equal intervals of length l. For example, to build a purine spectrum, we compute

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

n =

ui

l0+l

X
i=l0

Fq =

fq
f q

Pn =

ane−a
n!

where ui=1 if the site is occupied by a G or A and ui=0 otherwise. Ideally, one can divide the entire DNA sequence of
length L into m equal intervals of size l (l = L/m). The purine or GA spectrum can be built by computing n from all
the intervals. Alternatively, n can be computed in any segment between l0 and l0 + l and the spectrum (n distribution
or Pn) is built by varying the starting position l0 from 1, 2, 3 etc upto L − l so as to cover the whole sequence. We
adopt this second procedure for better statistics. Finally, the standard deviation (SD) of this Pn distribution can be
obtained from σ2 =< n2 − n0

2 > which in general will depend on the interval or the window size l.

In addition to the standard deviation σ2, we also compute the factorial moments Fq’s of Pn. The normalized

factorial moments of order q are written as

where

fq =

Pnn(n − 1).....(n − q + 1) =

∞

X
n=q

As will be shown later, the factorial moment has the distinct advantage over the normal moments in identifying the
genomic sequence from the random one. It may be mentioned here that for random Poisson distribution, the factorial
moments for all q’s become unity i.e. for

the above factor for fq becomes

fq =

which gives Fq=1.

In this work, we have applied the above factorial moment analysis (generally used to study the ﬂuctuations during

a phase transition [27]) to study the dynamical ﬂuctuations present in the DNA sequences.

III. PRINCIPLE OF COMPLIMENTARITY

A general property noticed for all the genomic sequences (of statistically signiﬁcant length) with a few exceptions
is that the distributions of any single or group of nucleotides which has a probability of occurrence p has the same
variance σ as that of its complimentary group that has the probability of occurrence (1 − p), although both have
diﬀerent distribution functions. This would imply that even a single nucleotide distribution say G distribution will
have same variance as that of AT C distribution or a GA distribution will have identical variance as that of T C
distribution. Figure 1 shows σ versus l plots for G and GA distributions (solid curves) for two typical sequences of
DROM HC (Drosphilia Melanogaster, MHC, 22663 bps, 20.5% G, 30.3% A, 25.4% T , 23.8% C) and SC M IT (yeast
mitochondrial DNA, 9.1% G, 42.2% A, 40.7% T , 8.0% C). As can be seen from the ﬁgure, the G and GA distributions
have same σ at all scale as that of AT C and T C distributions (ﬁlled circles) although the distribution functions of
the two complimentary groups need not be identical. The above agreement is exact for most of the DNA sequences
(with a few exceptions) as well as for the random sequences. For example, the σ for G and AT C distributions of
SC M IT and E.Coli : T N 10 (E.Coli with a T N 10 mobile transposion (9147 bps) at location 22000 bps) show 2% to
3% deviations at all scale depending on the total length of the sequences where as for other DNA as well as random

2

sequences, this agreement is exact. (This diﬀerence is not visible from ﬁgure 1 in case of SC M IT as the deviation
is insigniﬁcant over a large distance).

FIG. 1. The variance σ versus l for G and GA distributions (solid curves). Top panel is for DROM HC (Drosophilia
Melanogaster, MHC) while the bottom panel for SC M IT (yeast mitocondrial DNA). The ﬁlled circles are for the complimen-
tary AT C and T C distributions. The curve RW (dotted curve) corresponds to the slope in case of random walk (see text for
details). The curves are scaled up appropriately for better clarity.

Within the present formalism, we can also reproduce the result of random walk (RW ) model (See appendix for
more detail) by assigning ui = 1 for purine group (G and A) and ui = −1 for pyrimidine group (T and C). However,
unlike the random walk model of interpreting +1 and −1 as the probability of step up and step down, Pn can be
considered as the frequency distribution of n which gives the excess or deﬁcit of purines over pyrimidines. The σ
versus l as obtained from this assignment has also been shown in ﬁgure 1 (see the dotted curves labeled RW ) for
comparison. It is interesting to note that the RW curves shows a parallel shift with respect to the GA or T C curves
indicating that GA or T C distributions and RW model have similar ﬂuctuations at all scale. This is an interesting
observations, as we can now use GA or T C distributions as alternatives to the DNA walk representation to study the
correlation. The advantage is, since n represents a sum, unlike the DNA walk model, the entire spectrum lies to the
positive side of the coordinates which is essential to compute various higher moments like Fq of the distributions.

It is also important to note that although the complimentary distributions have same σ at all scale, the distribution
functions need not be exactly identical. Figure 2 shows a typical normalized density distribution functions Pn of
two complimentary distributions G and AT C for the above two sequences (SC M IT and DROM HC) as a function
of n − n0 (where n0 is the average count ) at a typical length scale of l = 150 (ﬁgures in left). The ﬁgures to the
right shows Pn distributions (x-axis is shifted by 100 for clarity) corresponding to the two purely random sequences
having same length and nucleotide contents as that of DROM HC and SC M IT sequences. It is interesting to note
that although σ versus l plots are (nearly) identical i.e., both distributions have same ﬂuctuations at all scales, the
distribution functions are not identical. This is an important characteristic of a DNA sequence which is not found in
case of a random one.

The curves on the right (shifted by 100 units) shows the corresponding distributions in case of a purely random sequence of
appropriate G, A, T and C contents.

IV. EXTRACTION OF SLOPE PARAMETER

The long range correlations are generally studied from the relation σ ∼ lα where the parameter α is extracted from
the σ versus l plot in the log-log scale. For the case of a completely random sequence, α ∼ 0.5. The deviation of
α from 0.5 indicates presence of long range correlations. We have estimated σ of G, A, T , C and GA distributions
for several DNA sequences and found that σ versus l plot in the log-log scale is not linear over the entire length 1.
Figure 3 shows σ versus l plot (bottom panel) for a typical E.Coli sequence of length L = 1.2 Mbps (solid curves)
and L = 30 Kbps (dotted curves) respectively. The top panel shows the factorial distributions of q=2, 3, 4 and 6 for
a typical A distributions, although similar plots can be obtained for other nucleotide distributions as well. A general
feature of the factorial moments of the DNA sequence with a few exception is that at short distances, Fq < 1.0 for all
q′s and exceeds unity at some point say at lq. This behavior is not found in case of a purely random sequence where
Fq is always ≤ 1.0. Further, all q’s do not cross unity exactly at the same point, lq being more for higher q values.
However, this variation is insigniﬁcant over a very large scale if we restrict to some of the lower moments say up to
q = 6.

From these plots and also from the several other studies, we make following few observations; (i) The σ versus l
plot is not linear through out, rather starts bending around some region (say lc, which could be diﬀerent for diﬀerent
distributions) indicating a change of slope from α1 to α2, (ii) For most of the cases, while α1 shows weak deviation
from 0.5, α2 deviates signiﬁcantly from 0.5 and also depends on the sequence length L, (iii) The individual nucleotide
distributions may have stronger correlations than any sum like GA and T C distributions or any other combinations.

1We consider only the G, A, T and C distributions to extract the correlation parameters for the individual nucelotides and
GA distributions to simulate the results of random walk model

FIG. 3.

(a) The factorial moments Fq versus l for a typical A distributions of E.Coli sequence of length 1.2 Mbps. (b) The
corresponding slope parameter σ versus l for E.Coli of length 1.2 Mbps (solid curves) and of length 30 Kbps (dashed curves).
The curves are scaled up appropriately for clarity.

Since σ versus l in the log-log plot starts bending around lc, we can extract the slope by dividing the entire length
into two segments; one for l < lc and the other one for l > lc. This can be done by examining each case individually.
However, we have noticed an approximate correlation between this bending region in σ versus l plot and the cross over
points lq of the corresponding factorial moments i.e. the slope changes around the same region where the factorial
moments become unity. This is a pure phenomenological observation which is found for several DNA sequences as
listed in tables with a few exceptions which we will discuss below. It may be mentioned here that although, the
two complimentary distributions have same ﬂuctuations, both need not have identical factorial moments. Figure 4
shows the plots of Fq versus l for A and GT C distribution for a LAM CG sequence. Since both are complimentary,
they have identical ﬂuctuations at all scales (hence same bending region), but the cross over regions in Fq plots are
diﬀerent, being higher for AT C distributions (due to large average values n0 at all scales). While the lq value of the A
distribution shows an approximate correlation with the bending region of σ versus l plot where a possible slope change
occurs, the lq values of GT C distribution has no such correlations. This is true for any complementary distributions
of G, A, T and C except for GA and T C distributions since both have nearly same overlapping cross over regions.

5

FIG. 4. The factorial moments Fq versus l for G and AT C distributions of LAM CG sequence

Therefore, only the lq values of the G, A, T , C and GA distributions are used as an approximate length scales
(lc). The entire length of the sequence is divided into two parts one for 0 < l < lc1 and other for lc2 < l < Lmax
where lc1 and lc2 are the minimum and maximum of all the lc corresponding to G, A, T , C and GA distributions.
The Lmax = L/30, i.e. we have at least 30 independent data sets so that the statistical analysis becomes meaningful.
Therefore, excluding the region lc1 < l < lc2, we have extracted α1 and α2 since the linearity in these two segments
are found to be extremely good for most of the cases. The results are summarized in three tables which covers both
intronless and intron containing sequences. The table shows the length of the sequence L used in the analyses, the
cross over values lq ( same as lc), the slope parameters α1 and α2 and also the corresponding percentage of the
nucleotide contents P . A general observation is that the sequence is weakly correlated at short distance with α1
which is quite close to 0.5 where as for l > lc, the correlation is relatively stronger with a larger value of α2. Now we
discuss a few exceptions like in the case of SC M IT and P ODOT 7 (T 7 bacteriophage, 39936 bps). Figure 5 shows
the factorial moments of a typical G distributions. In both the cases, the factorial moments do not have any cross
over point. In case of SC M IT , the factorial moments are much higher than unity even at small distance and starts
decreasing afterwards. The similar behavior is found for C distribution also. However, the A, T and GA distributions
do have lc points. Therefore, using lc1 as ∼ 36 and lc2 ∼ 184, we estimated α1 and α2 for G, A, T , C and GA
distributions which are listed in table III. The symbol ′∗′ indicates absence of any critical value. It is interesting to
note that α1 is quite large and in some cases α1 > α2. On the other hand , the factorial moments of the sequence like
P ODOT 7 do not reach unity at any scale. The absence of such type of scale has been indicated by the symbol ′−′
in table III. This type of sequences behave like a pure random one having α values quite close to 0.5. We have listed
a few such sequences with exceptions in table III.

FIG. 5. The factorial moments Fq versus l for G distributions of SC M IT (scaled up) and PODOT7 (T7 bacteriophage)

sequences.

Further, we would like to mention here that we have noticed that the factorial moments for many sequences starts
decreasing at large distances. Also for a few cases, the factorial moments start decreasing even at a very short
distances. Consequently, the slope also changes accordingly. However, we would not like to assign any reasons due to
lack of enough statistics.

The slope with α = 0.5 corresponds to the case of a normal diﬀusion process of a random Brownian trajectory. The
basic idea of a Brownian motion is that of a random walk having a Gaussian distribution probability for the position
of the random walker after a time t with the variance (σ2) proportional to t (σ ∼ tα where α = 0.5). This corresponds
to the case of normal diﬀusion. However, nature shows enough examples of anomalous diﬀusion characterized by a
variance which does not follow a linear growth in time [28]. In such cases either the diﬀusion is accelerated if α > 0.5
or the growth is dispersive if α < 0.5. As found in the analyses (see tables I and II), α2 > 0.5 at large distances for
most of the sequences irrespective of their intron contents. However, a few sequences as shown in table III, not only
peculiar, may also have α which decreases at large distances. In such cases, α < 0.5 which may indicate the inﬂuence
of dispersive dynamics. This aspect needs further investigations. Finally, we would like to add here that α1 is close to
0.5 for most of the sequences at short distance (see tables I and II). Although, α = 0.5 would imply about a random
behavior, it can not be told conclusively from the present analyses unless the short distance eﬀects are taken into
consideration [29].

V. PATCHY SEQUENCES

In the following, we investigate whether the mosaic character of DNA consisting of patches of diﬀerent composition
can account for apparent long range correlations in DNA sequences [18]. The Chargaﬀ’s second parity rule states
that in a single strand G ≈ C and T ≈ A. However, asymmetries in base composition have been observed in many
sequences. A quantitative estimate of the GC and AT skews can be obtained from the relation (G − C)/(G + C)
(Excess of G nucleotides over C nucleotides) and (A − T )/(A + T ) (Excess of A nucleotides over T nucleotides). This
is, operationally equivalent to estimating n as deﬁned in Eq.(1) except n now represents the count (G − C)/(G + C)
for GC skew and (A − T )/(A + T ) for AT skew in a ﬁxed window size of (L/20). We consider LAM CG as an example
and plot n (deﬁned appropriately) versus l0 where the starting position of the sliding window l0 varies from 1, 2, 3 etc

7

upto L − l. Figure 6 shows the plots of GC and AT skews as a function of the length for a typical LAM CG sequence.
The plots show a change in the direction of the slope with a change in sign of the skew. The quantity and quality of
the skew can be assessed from the V or from the inverted-V shape of the curves.

FIG. 6. The GC and AT skews as a function of l0 for LAM CG sequence.

From the above plots, we can identify three well known compositional domains of LAM CG of size 22000 bps (GA
contents 0.54), 17000 bps (GA contents 0.47) and 9000 bps (GA contents 0.54). We also consider an artiﬁcially
generated sequence by joining three random patches of size 22000 bps, 17000 bps and 9000 bps respectively with
appropriate G, A, T and C contents. We also consider another heterogeneous sequence generated from E.Coli DNA
by a mobile insertion of TN10 at location 22000 bps. The corresponding random patches are of size 22000 bps, 9147
bps and 22000 bps respectively 2

2 Please note the distinction between the random sequence which is generated by joining three random patches of total length
L and a pure random one of length L. Although, both the sequence has same percentage of nucleotide contents in the length
L, the former is random only patch wise.

FIG. 7. The Fq versus l of C distribution of for LAM CG and an artiﬁcially sequence generated by joining three randomly

generated patches of size 22000 bps, 17000 bps and 9000 bps with the same G, A, T and C contents as that of LAM CG.

Figure 7 shows the Fq versus l plot of a typical C distribution for LAM CG and for an artiﬁcially generated sequence
(random only patch wise). Interestingly, the factorial moments for both the cases behave similarly. Figure 8 shows a
similar σ(l) versus l plot both for real and artiﬁcially generated (from random patches) sequences. Although, in some
cases both agree, in general they are not identical at the individual nucleotide levels particularly at large distances
(Note that the scale is highly compressed). This deviation would mean that at large distances, the density distribution
functions will have signiﬁcant discrepancy due to diﬀerent widths. So at a ﬁrst look from the σ versus l plot, we can
say that the actual DNA sequences and the RANDOM patches need not have identical slopes α (hence the width
σ) at large distances for all the nucelotides although they agree in some cases. Even at short distances, although
the DNA and the RANDOM sequences have nearly identical width σ, the full shape of the distributions need not be
identical. To demonstrate this, we invoke the principle of complimentary which was mentioned before.

patches are of size 22000 bps, 9147 bps and 22000 bps with appropriate G, A, T and C contents.

Figure 9(a) shows a G and AT C distribution (left most) for a LAM CG sequence at l = 300. Notice that although
σ versus l plots are identical, i.e. both distributions have same ﬂuctuations at all scales, the distribution functions
are not same. Such diﬀerences are not found for a real random sequence (right most). The middle ﬁgure corresponds
to the case of artiﬁcially generated random sequence. Although, the artiﬁcially generated sequence mimics the real
sequence to some extent, it is not fully capable of reproducing the characteristic of a real sequence. Figure 9(b) shows
another comparison for a E.Coli :: T N 10 sequence for A and GT C distributions. This discrepancy will be more
prominent at higher l values which the artiﬁcially generated sequence can not reproduce.

an artiﬁcially generated sequence (middle) and for a completely random sequence (right most) shown for two complementary

VI. DENSITY DISTRIBUTIONS

In [26], we had demonstrated that the density distribution Pn is Gaussian at short distances and starts deviating
from it as the distance increases. Figure 10 shows another example where Pn has been plotted for two complimentary
distributions at l = 25, 100 and 200 respectively. The complimentary distributions are nearly identical at short
distance and coincide with the random distributions where as Pn distributions for G, AT C and pure random one are
all diﬀerent at larger distances.

FIG. 10. The density distribution Pn versus n − n0 (where n0 is average density) for LAM CG sequence at l = 25, 100 and
200 respectively. The solid and the dashed curves are for G and AT C distributions respectively where as the dotted curve is
for a purely random sequence.

Thus, irrespective of intron contents, most of the sequences follow Gaussian statistics at short distances. However,

at large distances, the statistics deviates signiﬁcantly from the Gaussian nature.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have extended our previous work to extract the slope parameter α for several intron containing
and intron less DNA sequences. The advantage of the present method is that the variance analysis can be applied
to any individual or group of nucleotides. We believe that the individual nucleotides provide a more fundamental
measure of the correlation than any combination or group (like the DNA walk representation) where the eﬀects may
get reduced or washed out. Another interesting aspect is the (lower) factorial moments of most of the DNA sequences
cross unity in a very narrow region in l where the σ versus l plot in the log-log scale also shows a bending. Although,
a formal justiﬁcation to this correlation has not been provided, we have used this scale as an approximate measure
to exclude the bending regions from the slope analyses. Based on this scale, we divide the DNA sequence into two
segments to extract the slope parameters. It is found that below this scale, the correlation is weak and the DNA
statistics is essentially Gaussian while above this all DNA sequences show strong long range correlations irrespective
of their intron contents with a signiﬁcant deviation from the Gaussian behavior. It may be mentioned here that the
controversies that exist in this ﬁeld of research are primarily due to diﬀerent approaches that are adopted in various
models. In this context, our analyses is model independent as it only involves the counting of an individual or a group
of nucleotides in a given length to build the density distribution. In this work, we do not advocate for any speciﬁc
model, although the extracted slope parameters indicate the presence of anomalous diﬀusion of both enhanced and
dispersive nature. Instead, we provide an elegant tool to measure the degree of correlations unambiguously so that
the interpretation of the data including theoretical analyses will become more meaningful. This work will also provide
further impetus to develop models for the understanding of the DNA dynamics.

APPENDIX: RANDOM WALK MODEL

The method of DNA walks, ﬁrst suggested by Peng et al [13] is based on the rule that the walker either moves
up (ui = 1) or down ui = −1) for each step i of the walk. This is the case of a correlated random walk and diﬀers
from an uncorrelated walk where the direction of each step is independent of the previous steps. Further they assign
ui = 1 if a pyrimidine occurs at the site i whereas ui = −1 if the site contains a purine. The net displacement (y) of
the walker after l steps is deﬁned as

The standard deviation of the above quantity can be estimated from

where α is the correlation exponents. For α close to 0.5, there is no correlation or only short range correlation in the
sequence. If α is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 0.5, it indicates long range correlations.

lc is the characteristic length scale. α1 is
the slope parameter for l < lc1 and α2 is the slope parameter for lc2 < l < lmax, where lc1 and lc2 are the minimum and the
maximum of all the lc, lmax=L/30 where L is the total length of the sequence. The acronym in column 1 is the name of the
GenBank. Since the factorial moments for all q do not cross exactly at same point, we have chosen lc for which Fq for q = 2, 3, 4

the cross over point lc, it is only approximate.

The inﬂuence of the intramolecular anharmonicity and the
strong vibron-phonon coupling on the two-vibron dynamics
in an α-helix protein is studied within a modiﬁed Davydov
model. The intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide-I vi-
bration is considered and the vibron dynamics is described
according to the small polaron approach. A unitary trans-
formation is performed to remove the intramolecular anhar-
monicity and a modiﬁed Lang-Firsov transformation is ap-
plied to renormalize the vibron-phonon interaction. Then, a
mean ﬁeld procedure is realized to obtain the dressed anhar-
monic vibron Hamiltonian. It is shown that the anharmonic-
ity modiﬁes the vibron-phonon interaction which results in
an enhancement of the dressing eﬀect. In addition, both the
anharmonicity and the dressing favor the occurrence of two
diﬀerent bound states which the properties strongly depend
on the interplay between the anharmonicity and the dressing.
Such a dependence was summarized in a phase diagram which
characterizes the number and the nature of the bound states
as a function of the relevant parameters of the problem. For
a signiﬁcant anharmonicity, the low frequency bound states
describe two vibrons trapped onto the same amide-I vibration
whereas the high frequency bound states refer to the trapping
of the two vibrons onto nearest neighbor amide-I vibrations.

I. INTRODUCTION

In low-dimensional molecular lattices, the nonlinear
nature of vibrational excitons (vibrons) plays a key role
for energy transfer as well as energy storage in both phys-
ical, chemical and biological systems. In a general way,
two main sources yield a nonlinear dynamics, namely the
intrinsic intramolecular anharmonicity of each molecule
and the extrinsic coupling between the vibrons and sur-
rounding low frequency excitations (such as phonons for
instance).

In classical lattices, the anharmonicity gives rise to
the occurences of intrinsic localized modes, or discrete
breathers, which have been the subject of intense re-
searches during the last decade (for a recent review see for
instance Refs. [1–3]). These highly localized vibrations
do not require integrability for their existence and cor-
respond to quite general and robust solutions [4]. Since
discrete breathers favor a local accumulation of the en-
ergy which might be pinned in the lattice or may travel
through it, they are expected to be of fundamental im-
portance for both energy storage and transport. Unfor-

tunately, no clear evidence has yet been found for the
existence of breathers in real molecular lattices. By con-
trast, in the quantum regime, two-vibron bound states
(TVBS) have been observed in several low-dimensional
systems [5–13]. In that case, the intramolecular anhar-
monicity breaks the vibron independence and favors the
formation of bound states [14–19]. When two vibrons
are excited, a bound state corresponds to the trapping of
two quanta over only a few neighboring molecules with
a resulting energy which is lesser than the energy of two
quanta lying far apart. The lateral interaction yields a
motion of such a state from one molecule to another, thus
leading to the occurrence of a delocalized wave packet
with a well-deﬁned momentum. As a result, TVBS are
the ﬁrst quantum states which experience the nonlinear-
ity and can thus be viewed as the quantum counterpart
of breathers or soliton excitations [16].

The second source of nonlinearity, which originates in
the coupling between vibrons and low frequency excita-
tions, was ﬁrst pointed out by Davydov and co-workers
[20] to explain the mechanisms for bioenergy transport.
The main idea is that the energy released by the hy-
drolysis of ATP can be stored in the high frequency
C=O vibration (amide-I) of a peptide group of a pro-
tein. The dipole-dipole coupling between the diﬀerent
peptide groups leads to the delocalization of the internal
vibrations and to the formation of vibrons. However, the
coupling between the vibrons and the phonons of the pro-
tein yields a nonlinear dynamics which counterbalances
the dispersion created by the dipole-dipole interaction.
It leads to the creation of the so called Davydov’s soli-
ton which provides an approximation to the self-trapping
phenomena described by a Fr¨ohlich type Hamiltonian
[21]. Soliton mechanisms for bioenergy transfer in pro-
teins have received increasing attention during the last
twenty ﬁve years and a broad review can be found in
Refs. [22,23].

However, as pointed out by Brown and co-workers
[24,25] and by Ivic and co-workers [26–28], the solution of
the Davydov’s problem is rather a small vibron-polaron
than a vibron-soliton. Indeed, the self-trapping process
exhibits two asymptotic solutions depending on the val-
ues taken by the three relevant parameters of the prob-
lem, i.e. the vibron bandwidth, the phonon cutoﬀ fre-
quency and the small polaron binding energy propor-
tional to the strength of the vibron-phonon coupling.
When the vibron bandwidth is greater than the phonon
cutoﬀ frequency, the adiabatic limit is reached. The

phonons behave in a classical way and create a quasi-
static potential well responsible for the trapping of the
vibron. The vibron, dressed by this lattice distortion,
forms a polaron which is described according to the soli-
ton theory of Davydov. By contrast, when the vibron
bandwidth is lesser than the phonon cutoﬀ frequency, the
situation corresponds to the non-adiabatic limit in which
the quantum behavior of the phonons plays a crucial role.
As mentioned by the authors, this situation corresponds
to the vibron dynamics in proteins. Therefore, a vibron
is dressed by a virtual cloud of phonons which yields a
lattice distortion essentially located on a single site and
which follows instantaneously the vibron. The dressing
eﬀect modiﬁes the vibron frequency, reduces the vibron
bandwidth and allows for an attractive interaction be-
tween vibrons mediated by virtual phonons. Such an in-
teraction is responsible for the formation of bound states
and it has been suggested that proteins can support soli-
tons formed by bound states involving a large number of
vibrational quanta [27,28].

As a consequence, the previous results clearly show
that both the intramolecular anharmonicity and the
strong vibron-phonon coupling produce a similar eﬀect
onto the vibron dynamics and favor the formation of
bound states. The present paper is thus devoted to the
fundamental question of the interplay between both non-
linear sources. To proceed, the Davydov model, mod-
iﬁed by introducing the intramolecular anharmonicity
of each amide-I vibration, is described within the small
polaron approach. The two-vibron energy spectrum is
studied with a special emphasis on the inﬂuence of the
intramolecular anharmonicity onto the dressing eﬀect.
Note that we do not investigate the formation of solitons
but focus how attention onto the creation of TVBS, only.
Such a procedure is twofold. First, as mentioned previ-
ously, TVBS are the ﬁrst quantum states sensitive to the
nonlinearity. Their characterization allows us to under-
stand the interplay between both nonlinear sources and
appears as a ﬁrst step to study the formation of multi-
vibron solitons. Then, recent theoretical calculations
have shown that single-vibron solitons do not last long
enough to be useful at biological temperatures [29,30].
By contrast, two-vibron solitons are more stable and ap-
pear as good candidates for bioenergy transport [31,32].
Note that a perfect knowledge of the two-vibron dynam-
ics is also required to interpret some experiments such as
time resolved pump-probe spectroscopy [33,34].

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the Davy-
dov Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional molecular lattice
is described. In Sec. III, we ﬁrst realize a unitary trans-
formation to remove the intramolecular anharmonicity.
Then, a modiﬁed Lang-Firsov [35] transformation is ap-
plied to renormalize the vibron-phonon interaction and
to reach the small polaron point of view. Finally, a mean
ﬁeld procedure is performed to obtain the dressed anhar-
monic vibron Hamiltonian.
IV, we summerize
the number states method used to solve the two-vibron
Schrodinger equation. In Sec. V, a detailed analysis of

In Sec.

the two-vibron energy spectrum is performed depending
on the values taken by the relevant parameters of the
problem. Finally, the results are discussed and inter-
preted in Sec. VI.

II. THE DAVYDOV HAMILTONIAN

According to the original Davydov model, the vibron-
phonon dynamics in an α-helix protein is described by
a one-dimensional system formed by N sites periodically
distributed along the lattice. Each site is occupied by
a peptide group which contains the amide-I vibration.
The nth amide-I vibration is assumed to behave as an
internal high frequency oscillator described by the stan-
dard creation and annihilation vibron operators b+
n and
bn. The vibron Hamiltonian is thus written as (using the
convention ¯h=1)

Hv =

n bn + γ3(b+

n + bn)3 + γ4(b+

where ω0 stands for the internal frequency of the nth
amide-I mode and where J denotes the lateral hopping
constant between nearest neighbor amide-I vibrations. In
Eq.(1), γ3 and γ4 represent the cubic and quartic anhar-
monic parameters of each amide-I mode.

The amide-I vibrations interact with the phonons of
the lattice which characterize the collective dynamics of
the external motions of the peptide groups. Within the
harmonic approximation, each peptide group, with mass
M , interacts with its nearest neighbor peptide groups
via the lateral force constant W . Therefore, the phonons
correspond to a set of N low frequency acoustic modes,
labeled

Finally, the vibron-phonon interaction Hamiltonian,

fusion).

The vibron-phonon dynamics is thus described by the
full Hamiltonian H = Hv + Hp + ∆Hvp which slightly
diﬀers from the original Davydov model. The Davydov
Hamiltonian is recovered from Eqs.(1)-(3) by restricting
the full Hamiltonian to vibron-conserving terms, only,
and by neglecting the intramolecular anharmonicity of
each amide-I vibration. Although the full Hamiltonian
H yields a rather simple model for the protein dynamics,
it cannot be solved exactly due to the anharmonic con-
tributions. The following section is thus devoted to its
simpliﬁcation to obtain an eﬀective Hamiltonian describ-
ing the vibron dynamics.

III. DRESSED ANHARMONIC VIBRONS

A. Renormalization of the intramolecular
anharmonicity

To remove the cubic and quartic intramolecular anhar-
monicity, the standard procedure described by Kimball
et al. [14] is used. First, by disregarding the lateral cou-
pling between nearest neighbor amide-I vibrations as well
as the vibron-phonon interaction, the procedure consists
in performing a unitary transformation T to diagonalize
each anharmonic amide-I mode. Then, an approximate
Hamiltonian is obtained by applying the transformation
on the full Hamiltonian H and be keeping the vibron-
conserving terms, only.

As a result, by using the formula shown in appendix A,
the transformed vibron-phonon Hamiltonian ˜H = T HT +
is expressed as

The unitary transformation allows us to diagonalize
each anharmonic amide-I vibration up to the second or-
der with respect to the anharmonic parameters. As a re-
sult, the vibron operators describe new vibrational states,
called anharmonic vibrons, which are expressed as linear
superimpositions of the harmonic states of each amide-
I mode. Therefore, Eq.(5) clearly shows that the an-

interaction between two vibrons and favor their trapping
around the same amide-I site and around two nearest

tional to J2 characterize hops in the course of which two
vibrons, initially located on the same amide-I vibration,
realize simultaneously a transition to a nearest neighbor
amide-I site. In the same way, the contributions propor-
tional to J3 aﬀect single-vibron hops from states formed
by two vibrons located onto the same amide-I vibration.
Finally, the anharmonicity leads to a correction of the
vibron-phonon coupling Hamiltonian and Eq.(5) shows
that single- and two-vibron states do not experience the
same interaction with the phonon bath. When com-
pared with the harmonic situation, the coupling between
phonons and single-vibron states is enhanced by the an-

Moreover, the terms ηb+
n bnbn, which act onto two-
vibron states only, show that two vibrons located onto
the same amide-I mode interact in a diﬀerent way with
the phonons bath when compared with two vibrons which
are far apart. Note that the anharmonic corrections oc-
curring in Eq.(7) are typically of the order of A/ω0 and
represent rather small contributions which have been ne-
glected in our previous works [17–19]. Nevertheless, al-
though some changes can eﬀectively be disregarded, such
as the modiﬁcation of the hopping constants, other con-
tributions play a signiﬁcant role, especially the correction
of the vibron-phonon interaction, as it will be shown in
the following sections.

The next step in our procedure is to partially remove

The transformation U (Eq.(8)) slightly diﬀers from the
true Lang-Firsov transformation due to its dependence
with respect to the vibron population operators. This
dependence originates in the modiﬁcation of the vibron-
phonon interaction mediated by the intramolecular an-
harmonicity (see Eq.(5)) and the original Lang-Firsov
transformation is recovered by setting η = 0. There-

In this dressed anharmonic vibron point of view
(Eq.(10)), the vibron-phonon coupling remains through
the modulation of the lateral terms by the dressing oper-
ators Θn(Nn). Although these operators depend on the
phonon coordinates in a highly nonlinear way, the vibron-
phonon interaction has been strongly reduced within this
transformation. As a result, we can take advantage of
such a reduction to express the full Hamiltonian ˆH as
the sum of three separated contributions as [26,27]

The Hamiltonian ˆHef f (Eq.(14)) describes the dynam-
ics of the anharmonic vibrons dressed by a virtual cloud
of phonons, i.e. anharmonic small polarons.
It takes
into account on the anharmonicity up to the second or-
der and allows for a renormalization of the main part
of the vibron-phonon coupling within the non-adiabatic
limit. The interaction Hamiltonian ∆H, which charac-
terizes the coupling between these dressed anharmonic
vibrons and the remaining phonons, is assumed to be
small in order to be treated using perturbation theory.
Such a contribution, responsible for phase relaxation, will
be studied in a forthcoming paper.

Eq.(14) clearly shows the interplay between the in-
tramolecular anharmonicity and the strong vibron-
phonon coupling. The Hamiltonian ˆHef f exhibits, ba-
sically, the same contributions as the vibron part of the
anharmonic Hamiltonian ˜H. The main diﬀerence is that
the parameters occurring in ˆHef f are renormalized due to
the dressing eﬀect which modiﬁes the dynamics accord-
ing to two main ways. First, it yields additional contribu-
tions to the anharmonic parameters A and B as well as to
the internal frequency ω0 (Eq.(11)). Then, the dressing
eﬀect modiﬁes the diﬀerent lateral contributions via the
dressing function Φ(X) which reduces the hopping con-
stants. However, in a marker contrast with the harmonic
situation, the intramolecular anharmonicity enhances the
role played by both the small polaron binding energy and
the coupling constant S(T ). In addition, the dressing ef-
fect depends on the vibron population. As shown in the
next section, such a dependence discriminates transitions
involving two vibrons located onto the same amide-I vi-
bration from transitions involving two vibrons which are
far apart.

IV. TWO-VIBRON STATES

Since the eﬀective Hamiltonian ˆHef f (Eq.(14)) con-
serves the number of dressed anharmonic vibrons, its
eigenstates can be characterized by using the number
states method [16–19]. Within this method, the two-
vibron wave function is expanded as

cated onto the sites n1 and n2, respectively. The expres-
sion of the corresponding time independent Schrodinger
equation, ˆHef f |
, depends on the nature
i
of the basis vectors involved in.
Indeed, from Eq.(14),
there are three diﬀerent situations either describing two
vibrons located onto sites which are far apart, two vi-
brons located onto nearest neighbor sites and two vibrons
located onto the same site.

Eq.(17) shows that the two vibrons move in an inde-
pendent way according to an eﬀective hopping constant
J1Φ(1) = J1exp[
(1 + 4η)S(T )] which slightly diﬀers
from the hopping constant involved in the harmonic ap-
proximation. Indeed, as discussed in the previous section,
the intramolecular anharmonicity modiﬁes the harmonic
hopping constant (J
J1) and enhances the dressing
(1 + 4η)S(T )). Therefore, although the
eﬀect (S(T )
anharmonic parameter η is rather small, it acts under
the exponential and then reduces the eﬀective hopping
constant with respect to the harmonic situation.

As shown in Eqs.(18)-(19), both the intramolecular an-
harmonicity and the dressing eﬀect strongly modify

the dynamics involving vibrons located onto neighbor-
ing sites. First, they contribute to a redshift of the
energies of the corresponding states. Then, they af-
fect the hopping processes by favoring simultaneous mo-
tions of two vibrons and by changing the dressing ef-
fect which is characterized by the eﬀective correction
(1+6η)S(T )]. This latter feature originates
Φ(2) = exp[
in the dependence of the dressing operators (Eq.(12)) on
the vibron population. Therefore, since Φ(2) is lesser
than Φ(1), it is clear that the trapping process experi-
enced by two vibrons located onto the same site is more
eﬃcient than the dressing eﬀect which modify the single-
vibron dynamics.

Eqs.(17)-(19) clearly indicate how the physics of the
two-vibron states is related to the dynamics of a sin-
gle ﬁctitious particle moving quantum mechanically on
the two-dimensional lattice displayed in Fig. 1a [17–19].
Within this equivalence, the two-vibron wave function

binding Hamiltonian characterized by the self-energy 2ˆω0
located on each site and a hopping matrix J1Φ(1) which
couples nearest neighbor sites. However, the 2D lattice
exhibits two rows of defects (see Fig. 1a) which yield a
redshift of the self-energy of the corresponding sites as
well as for a modiﬁcation of the hopping matrix elements
connecting the defect sites. Therefore, such defects allow
us to discriminate between two diﬀerent eigenstates. The
eigenstates of the core of the lattice correspond to plane
waves slightly perturbed by the defects. By contrast, the
presence of the defects leads to the occurrence of states
which are localized in the vicinity of the two defect rows.
In terms of the two-vibron dynamics, the previous equiva-
lence yields two diﬀerent kinds of eigenstates. Indeed, the
delocalization of the ﬁctitious particle is associated to a
free motion of the two vibrons, i.e. two-vibron free states
(TVFS), whereas its localization is connected to the oc-
currence of TVBS. Note that in marked contrast with the
standard Hubbard Hamiltonian for bosons [14,16,18], the
presence of two defect rows in our equivalent lattice shows
that the system can support two kinds of bound states
corresponding to the trapping of the two vibrons either
onto the same amide-I vibration or onto nearest neighbor
amide-I sites, respectively.

The Schrodinger equation Eqs.(17)-(19) can be ex-
pressed in an improved way by taking advantage of the
lattice periodicity. Indeed, the two-vibron wave function
is invariant with respect to a translation along the lattice
and can be expanded as a Bloch wave as

Ψ(n1, n2 = n1 + m) =

eik(n1+m/2)Ψk(m) (20)

1
√N Xn1

In Eq.(20), the total momentum k, which belongs to the
ﬁrst Brillouin zone of the molecular lattice, is associated
to the motion of the center of mass of the two vibrons
whereas the resulting wave function Ψk(m) refers to the
degree of freedom m which characterizes the distance

5

between the two vibrons. Since the momentum k is a
good quantum number, the Hamiltonian ˆHef f appears
as block diagonal and the Schrodinger equation can be
solved for each k value. Therefore, when two vibrons are
located onto sites which are far apart (m > 1), Eq.(17)
becomes
(2ˆω0 −

where Γk = 2J1Φ(1)cos(k/2). In the same way, when two

Finally, for each wave vector k, the two-vibron dynam-
ics reduces to a one-dimensional tight-binding problem
on a semi-inﬁnite lattice which exhibits two defects (see
Fig. 1b). The Schrodinger equation Eqs.(21)-(23) can
thus be solved easily to obtain the two-vibron eigenstates
and to determine the two-vibron energy spectrum. This
procedure is illustrated in the following section.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS

In this section, the previous formalism is applied to
characterize the two-vibron energy spectrum of an α-
helix protein. However, the present theory involves a
set of parameters which has ﬁrst to be discussed.

From the literature, the harmonic dynamics of vibrons
in α-helices is relatively well described (see for instance
Refs. [16,27]). The quantum energy for an amide-I vi-
bration is about ω0 = 1665 cm−1 and a well admitted
value for the hopping constant is J = 7.8 cm−1. By con-
trast, the phonon dynamics as well as the vibron-phonon
coupling parameter are only partially known. The mass
M of a peptide group ranges between 1.17 10−25 kg and
1.91 10−25 kg, whereas the phonon force constant W is
expected to be about 13-19.5 Nm−1. As a result, the
phonon cutoﬀ frequency varies from 87 to 137 cm−1. In
the same way, a typical range for the vibron-phonon cou-
62 pN. Therefore, the vibron-
pling term is χ = 35
phonon coupling parameter ∆0 ranges between 12 and
29 cm−1 and the small polaron binding energy EB ex-
tends from 3 to 15 cm−1.

−

In a marked contrast with the previous parameters,
little is known about the intramolecular anharmonicity
of each amide-I vibration. Therefore, to determine the
range of the anharmonic parameters, we assume that

the amide-I vibration is equivalent to the C=O stretch-
ing mode of a single molecule, but with a diﬀerent re-
duced mass µ. By describing both vibrations accord-
ing to a Morse potential, it is straightforward to show
that ω0 scales as 1/√µ whereas the anharmonicity A
scales as 1/µ. By comparing the harmonic frequency of
both the amide-I vibration and the C=O stretching mode
(ω0 = 2170 cm−1 [36]), the reduced mass of the amide-I
mode is about 1.6-1.7 times the reduced mass of the C=O
molecule. As a consequence, since the anharmonic pa-
rameter for the C=O stretching mode is A = 13.3 cm−1
[36], the anharmonic constant of the amide-I vibration is
about A = 8.0 cm−1. Note that this latter value repre-
sents an order of magnitude of the anharmonic parameter
since, strictly speaking, the anharmonicity of the amide-
I vibration depends on the details of the corresponding
intramolecular potential.
In addition, our calculations
establish that both the cubic and quartic anharmonic
parameters can be expressed approximately in terms of
A by using the relation 15γ2

3/ω0 ≈
As a result, in the following of the text, the intramolec-
ular anharmonicity will be described by a single param-
eter, namely the anharmonic constant A. The small po-
laron binding energy EB is taken as a parameter whereas
the phonon cutoﬀ frequency Ωc is ﬁxed to 100 cm−1.
The temperature is set to the biological temperature, i.e.
T = 310 K, and the hopping constant is set to J = 7.8
cm−1.

The inﬂuence of the intramolecular anharmonicity on
the two-vibron energy spectrum is shown in Figs. 2, 3
and 4 for three typical situations.
In each ﬁgure, the
spectrum is centered onto the corrected frequency 2ˆω0
(Eq.(11)) and corresponds to the two-vibron dispersion
curves drawn in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone of the lattice, i.e.

−

π < k < π.
When EB = 8 cm−1 and A = 0 (Fig. 2a), the two-
vibron energy spectrum is formed by an energy contin-
uum associated to the TVFS. This continuum is sym-
metrically located around 2ˆω0 with a bandwidth equal to
31.21 cm−1. Below the continuum, the energy spectrum
exhibits two bands connected to two diﬀerent bound
states. The low frequency band, located below the TVFS
over the entire Brillouin zone, refers to bound states de-
noted TVBS-I. The bottom of this band is located at
24.74 cm−1 below the center of the continuum and its
bandwidth is about 8.7 cm−1. The second band, which
refers to bound states denoted TVBS-II, is located be-
low the continuum at the end of the Brillouin zone,
only. The band disappears inside the continuum when
< kc = 2.06. When the anharmonic parameter is
|
|
set to A = 10 cm−1 (Fig. 2b), the TVFS bandwidth
is reduced to 28.40 cm−1. Note that the center of the
continuum is redshifted due to the dependence of 2ˆω0
(Eq.(11)) on the anharmonic parameter A (not drawn in
the ﬁgure). Then, the intramolecular anharmonicity is
responsible for a strong redshift of the TVBS-I band as
well as for a decrease of the corresponding bandwidth.
The bottom of the band is located at 43.39 cm−1 below

k

6

the center of the continuum and the bandwidth is equal
to 2.78 cm−1. Finally, although the anharmonicity does
not signiﬁcantly change the shape of the TVBS-II band,
it leads to a decrease of the critical wave vector for which
its disappearance arises since kc = 0.70.

When EB is set to 10 cm−1, the two-vibron energy
spectrum is shown in Figs. 3a and 3b. In the harmonic
case, i.e. A = 0 (Fig. 3a), the energy spectrum ex-
hibits the same features as in Fig. 2a. Nevertheless, the
TVFS bandwidth is smaller and equal to 26.24 cm−1.
The width of the TVBS-I band has been reduced to 6.04
cm−1 and the bottom of the band is located at 26.04
cm−1 below the center of the continuum.
In addition,
the critical wave vector connected to the disappearance
of the TVBS-II has been reduced to kc = 1.70. When
the anharmonic parameter is set to A = 10 cm−1, we
observe the same behavior as in Fig. 2b. Indeed, both
the TVFS and the TVBS-I bandwidths decrease to reach
23.30 cm−1 and 1.70 cm−1, respectively. In addition, the
bottom of the TVBS-I band is strongly redshifted and
is located at 47.47 cm−1 below the center of the contin-
uum. However, a new process arises since the intramolec-
ular anharmonicity yields the occurrence of the TVBS-II
band over the entire Brillouin zone. The corresponding
bandwidth is equal to 1.53 cm−1 and the bottom of the
band is located at 13.42 cm−1 below the center of the
continuum.

The situation corresponding to a strong small polaron
binding energy is ﬁnally illustrated in Figs. 4a and 4b
for EB=14 cm−1. The main diﬀerence when compared
with the two previous cases is that the dressing eﬀect
is strong enough to induce the occurrence of the TVBS-
II band over the entire Brillouin zone, even when A = 0
(Fig. 4a). As previously, the intramolecular anharmonic-
ity reduces both the TVFS continuum and the TVBS-I
bandwidth and yields a strong redshift of the TVBS-I
band. Moreover, it increases the frequency diﬀerence be-
tween the TVBS-II band and the center of the continuum
and reduces the TVBS-II bandwidth.

The diﬀerence between the two bound states is illus-
trated in Fig. 5. Figs. 5a and 5b show the TVBS wave
functions with zero wave vector and which the energy
spectrum is displayed in Figs. 3a and 3b, respectively
(EB = 10 cm−1). By contrast, Figs. 5c and 5d refer to
the TVBS which the energy spectrum is shown in Figs.
4a and 4b, respectively (EB = 14 cm−1). The TVBS-I
wave function is described by open circles whereas the
TVBS-II wave function is represented by open squares.
When A = 0 and EB = 10 cm−1 (Fig. 5a), the TVBS-I
wave function is maximum when m = 0 and decreases
as the separating distance m between the two vibrons
increases. However, it does not exhibit a true exponen-
tial decrease versus m. When the anharmonicity is set to
A = 10 cm−1 (Fig. 5b), the lattice supports two bound
states with zero wave vector (see Fig. 3b). As previously,
the TVBS-I wave function is maximum when m = 0 but
the extension of the wave function has been reduced when
compared with the harmonic case, i.e. it decreases expo-

nentially versus m. By contrast, the TVBS-II wave func-
tion is maximum when m = 1 and exhibits an exponen-
tial tail as m increases. When EB = 14 cm−1, the lattice
supports two bound states with zero wave vector what-
ever the anharmonicity (Figs. 4a and 4b). When A = 0
(Fig. 5c), the TVBS-I wave function, which is maximum
when m = 0, shows a signiﬁcant value when m = 1 and
does not decrease according to a true exponential. The
TVBS-II wave function is maximum when m = 1 and
exhibits a rather important weight when m = 0. By con-
trast, when the anharmonicity is set to A = 10 cm−1
(Fig. 5d), the TVBS-I and the TVBS-II wave functions
are clearly localized onto m = 0 and m = 1, respectively,
both wave functions exhibiting an exponential tail versus
m.

As mentioned previously, the intramolecular anhar-
monicity is responsible for a slight decrease of the TVFS
bandwidth. This feature is illustrated in Fig. 6 where
the behavior of the bandwidth is shown as a function
of A for diﬀerent values of EB. The ﬁgure exhibits two
distinct regimes. When EB = 0, the TVFS bandwidth
slightly increases in a linear way as the anharmonicity
increases. The bandwidth, equal to 62.40 cm−1 when
A = 0, is blueshifted of about 0.36 cm−1 when A = 10
cm−1. In a marked contrast, for ﬁnite values of EB, the
TVFS bandwidth is strongly reduced and decreases as A
increases. When EB = 9 cm−1 and A = 0, the band-
width is equal to 28.6 cm−1 whereas it reaches the value
25.7 cm−1 when A = 10 cm−1, i.e. a variation of about
2.9 cm−1.

In Figs. 7a and 7b, the inﬂuence of the anharmonicity
on the TVBS-I is illustrated for diﬀerent values of EB.
As shown in Fig. 7a, the TVBS-I binding energy EI ,
deﬁned as the gap between the TVBS-I with zero wave
vector and the bottom of the TVFS continuum, decreases
as the anharmonicity increases. When EB = 0, EI de-
creases from zero according to a A2 power law for small A
values and reaches a quasi-linear decrease for a stronger
anharmonicity. For ﬁnite values of EB, EI reaches more
rapidly the linear regime as increasing A and the slope
of the decrease slightly increases with EB. Note that EI
decreases with the small polaron binding energy. In Fig.
7b, the behavior of the TVBS-I bandwidth as function
of A is illustrated for diﬀerent values of EB. In a gen-
eral way, the TVBS-I bandwidth decreases as the anhar-
monicity increases. However, for a small anharmonicity,
the TVBS-I bandwidth exhibits a rather fast decrease
whereas it decreases more slowly for a stronger anhar-
monicity. When EB = 9 cm−1, the TVBS-I bandwidth
is equal to 7.28 cm−1 when A = 0 and reaches 2.67 cm−1
when A = 8 cm−1, i.e. almost 0.3 times smaller.

Finally, Fig. 8 displays the behavior of the critical wave
vector kc for which the TVBS-II band disappears. In a
general way, kc decreases as A increases and vanishes for
a critical value of the anharmonic parameter A = Ac. In
others words, when A > Ac, the TVBS-II band is located
below the continuum. By contrast, when A < Ac, the
TVBS-II band appears below the continuum at the end

curves clearly exhibit a critical behavior since kc scales as

kc ≈
shown in the inset of Fig. 8, kc shows a similar behavior
with respect to the temperature. Indeed, for A = 8 cm−1
and EB = 10 cm−1, the critical wave vector decreases as
increasing the temperature and vanishes when T = Tc =
236 K. Therefore, when T > Tc , the TVBS-II band
is located below the continuum over the entire Brillouin
zone. Note that kc shows the same critical behavior when
it approaches zero and scales as kc ≈

VI. DISCUSSION

−

To interpret and discuss the previous numerical results,
let us ﬁrst focus our attention onto the inﬂuence of the
anharmonicity on the TVFS continuum. As shown in
Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 6, the intramolecular anharmonicity is
responsible for a redshift of the TVFS bandwidth, typ-
ically of about a few wave numbers. Note that, when
EB = 0, i.e. when there is no coupling with the phonon
bath, the anharmonicity leads to a very small blueshift
of the continuum bandwidth. These features originate in
the modiﬁcation of the hopping constant J due to both
the anharmonicity and the dressing eﬀect.
Indeed, as
discussed in Sec.
IV, a TVFS corresponds to an inde-
pendent motion of the two vibrons according to an ef-
fective hopping constant J1Φ(1) = J1exp[
(1 + 4η)S(T )]
which diﬀers from the constant involved in the harmonic
approximation. First, the intramolecular anharmonic-
ity slightly increases the harmonic hopping constant (see
Eq.(7)) yielding a blueshift of the TVFS continuum when
EB = 0. Then, the anharmonicity reinforces the role
played by the coupling constant S(T ) which character-
izes the dressing eﬀect (S(T )
(1 + 4η)S(T )). There-
fore, it enhances the dressing eﬀect and favors a decrease
of the eﬀective hopping constant. Although both con-
tributions act in an opposite way, the enhancement of
the dressing eﬀect appears to be more eﬃcient for non
vanishing values of the small polaron binding energy. In
other words, anharmonic vibrons are more sensitive to
the dressing eﬀect than harmonic vibrons. For instance,
when T = 310 K, EB = 14 cm−1 and J = 7.8 cm−1, the
eﬀective hopping constant J1Φ(1) is equal to 2.32 cm−1
within the harmonic case whereas it is redshifted to 1.96
cm−1 when A = 10 cm−1, i.e. a reduction of about 15%.
The main result of the present study concerns the mod-
iﬁcation of the bound states due to the interplay between
the intramolecular anharmonicity and the strong vibron-
phonon coupling. Indeed, for the harmonic lattice, the
dressing eﬀect is responsible for the occurrence of two
diﬀerent bound states, i.e. TVBS-I and TVBS-II. The
TVBS-I are located below the TVFS continuum over the
entire Brillouin zone. By contrast, for TVBS-II, two sit-
uations occur depending on the strength of the small po-

→

|

k

laron binding energy. For small values of EB, the band
disappears inside the continuum when the wave vector
is lower than a critical wave vector kc whereas, for
|
strong values of EB, the band is located below the contin-
uum over the entire Brillouin zone. As when increasing
the anharmonicity, the TVBS-I band is redshifted and
its bandwidth is strongly reduced. In the same way, the
anharmonicity modiﬁes the nature of the TVBS-II band.
If the band is resonant with the continuum, the anhar-
monicity yields a decrease of the critical wave vector.
Therefore, if it is strong enough, the anharmonicity al-
lows for the TVBS-II band to get out of the continuum
over the entire Brillouin zone. When the TVBS-II band
is not resonant with the continuum, the anharmonicity
induces a redshifted of the band as well as a decrease
of its bandwidth. All the previous features are accompa-
nied by a modiﬁcation of the wave functions of the bound
states.

To understand these features, we can take advantage
of the equivalence between the two-vibron dynamics and
the tight-binding problem on the one-dimensional lattice
displayed in Fig. 1b. Within this equivalence, bound
states in the real molecular lattice are described in terms
of localized states in the equivalent lattice, the localiza-
tion occurring due to the presence of the two defects.
For a given k value, the previous results clearly show
that the system supports one or two bound states, de-
pending on the values taken by the relevant parameters
of the problem (anharmonicity, small polaron binding en-
ergy, temperature ...). In other words, if these parame-
ters are allowed to vary, a localization transition arises in
the equivalent lattice. Such a transition discriminates be-
tween two ”phases”. The ﬁrst phase corresponds to the
presence of a single localized state (i.e. a single bound
state in the real lattice) whereas the second phase is con-
nected to the occurrence of two localized states (i.e. two
bound states). A localized state is characterized by its lo-
calization length ξ which refers to the length of the bond
between two vibrons in a bound state. The disappear-
ance of a localized state is accompanied by a divergence
of the localization length since it now refers to two inde-
pendent vibrons.

Such a process is similar to a critical transition and
consequently, we can use the tools of the Renormaliza-
tion Group (RG) theory to understand the transition and
predict the occurrence of localized states (i.e. of bound
states). This can be achieved by performing a decimation
of the Schrodinger equation as detailed in Refs. [37,38]
and summarized in appendix B. The decimation consists
in eliminating from the initial equivalent lattice one site
over two to arrive at a scaled lattice with twice the lat-
tice spacing. If the initial lattice is at a critical point, i.e.
if the localization transition takes place, the localization
length ξ is inﬁnite and the dynamics is in a self-similar
situation. As a result, no change in the critical parame-
ters accompanies the length scaling and the scaled lattice
remains at a critical point. The decimation procedure
can be applied recursively until the lattice parameter has

8

been increased up to inﬁnity. By operating in such a way,
we decrease drastically the number of sites in the equiv-
alent lattice, and obtain a scaled lattice which reduces to
the two side sites m = 0 and m = 1, only (see Fig. 1b).
It is thus possible to study exactly the Schrodinger equa-
tion of such a critical system and then to characterize
the critical properties of the initial lattice. By following
this procedure (see appendix B), the condition for the oc-
currence of localized states in the equivalent lattice, i.e.
for the occurrence of bound states in the real lattice, is
deﬁned as

(24)

( ˆAk −

Γk)( ˆB

Γk) = γ2

−
where the parameters occurring in Eq.(24) are deﬁned in
Sec. IV.

As shown in Fig. 9, Eq.(24) deﬁnes the critical curve
in the space of the parameters which separate the phase
I, with a single bound state, from the phase II, with two
bound states. In phase I, the nature of the bound state
depends on the relative values of the parameters and
three main situations occur. When ˆAk >> ˆB, the lo-
calization arises around the ﬁrst site m = 0.
In other
words, TVBS-I characterizes the trapping of two vibrons
around the same amide-I vibration. By contrast, when
ˆAk << ˆB, the localization occurs on the second site
m = 1 and the two vibrons are trapped onto nearest
neighbor amide-I modes. In the intermediate case, when
ˆB, the localized state is a superimposition of states
ˆAk ≈
localized on sites m = 0 and m = 1. As a result, TVBS-
I characterizes a superimposition of states trapped over
both the same amide-I mode and two nearest neighbor
amide-I modes.
In phase II, the lattice supports two
bound states. When ˆAk >> ˆB, TVBS-I corresponds to
the trapping of the two vibrons onto the same amide-
I mode whereas TVBS-II characterizes the trapping of
the two vibrons onto nearest neighbor amide-I modes.
As shown in Fig. 9, the revert situation takes place
when ˆAk << ˆB. Finally, when ˆAk < ˆB < 2 ˆAk, both
bound states appear as combinations of states involving
the trapping of the two vibrons onto the same amide-I
mode and onto nearest neighbor amide-I modes.

In the harmonic α-helix protein, i.e. A = 0, Eq.(11)
yields ˆAk = ˆB = EB. Therefore, the critical curve
Eq.(24) shows that when EB < 4JΦ(0)cos(k/2), the lat-
tice exhibits a single bound state which mixes the trap-
ping onto the same amide-I mode and onto two nearest
neighbor amide-I modes (see Fig. 5a). By contrast, when
EB > 4JΦ(0)cos(k/2), the lattice supports two bound
states, both being a superimposition of states involving
the trapping onto the same and onto two nearest neigh-
bor amide-I modes (see Fig. 5c). Note that the condition
for the occurrence of two bound states over the entire
Brillouin zone is EB > 4JΦ(0). As when increasing the
anharmonicity A, Eq.(11) shows that ˆAk > ˆB. For in-
stance, when T = 310 K, EB = 14 cm−1 and A = 10
cm−1, ˆA is equal to 28.29 cm−1 whereas ˆB is equal to
16.54 cm−1. Therefore, the anharmonicity decreases the

hybridization between the two kinds of trapping. As a
result, TVBS-I corresponds essentially to the trapping
onto the same amide-I mode whereas TVBS-II, when it
is present, characterizes the trapping onto two nearest
neighbor amide-I modes (see Figs. 5b and 5d). Note that
the hybridization between the two trapping processes is
also reduced when the hopping constants Γk and γk de-
crease, i.e. when the diﬀerent sites m become uncorre-
lated. This feature arises when the TVBS wave vector
approaches π as well as when the temperature increases
due to the dressing eﬀect.

Although the phase diagram displayed in Fig. 9 al-
lows for a complete understanding of the nature of the
bound states, it involves parameters which are not in-
dependent. For instance, both ˆAk and ˆB depend on A
and EB. However, from Eq.(24), we can deﬁne a phase
diagram in the (A, EB) parameter space. Such diagram
is illustrated in Fig. 10 for a zero wave vector. The tem-
perature is ﬁxed to T = 310 K whereas three diﬀerent
values for the hopping constant J have been considered.
The curve discriminates between a phase with a single
bound state and a phase with two bound states, both
states being located below the continuum over the entire
Brillouin zone since k = 0. The ﬁgure clearly shows that
the anharmonicity favors the occurrence of two bound
states by decreasing the value of the required small po-
laron binding energy. For instance, when J = 7.8 cm−1
and A = 0, EB must exceed 11.5 cm−1 to allow for the
occurrence of the TVBS-II. By contrast, this value is re-
duced to 8.7 cm−1 when A = 8 cm−1. Note that the
curve is pushed down as decreasing the hopping constant
as well as increasing the temperature due to the dressing
eﬀect.

From a physical point of view, the previous phase di-
agrams can be easily understood in terms of localization
in the equivalent lattice. Indeed, since the equivalent lat-
tice exhibits two defects onto the sites m = 0 and m = 1,
it can supports two states localized onto the sites m = 0
and m = 1. However, due to the hopping processes, these
two localized states overlapp and interact to generate new
localized states which appear as superimpositions of the
two previous states. Such a mechanism is accompanied
by a splitting of the frequency of the new localized states
which depends on both the strength of the coupling be-
tween the original states as well as on their frequency.
As a result, we obtain a high frequency localized state
(TVBS-II) and a low frequency localized state (TVBS-
I). If the splitting is strong enough, the high frequency
localized state is pushed back into the continuum and a
single localized state remains. By contrast, if the split-
ting is rather weak, both localized states can be located
below the continuum. As shown in Eqs.(21)-(22), the in-
tramolecular anharmonicity increases the energy diﬀer-
ence between the two original localized states. In addi-
tion, since it enhances the dressing eﬀect, it reduces the
coupling between these two states. As a result, the an-
harmonicity favors a weak hybridization between the two
original localized states. The main consequence is that

9

TVBS-I and TVBS-II are essentially localized around
m = 0 and m = 1, respectively.

The present paper has clearly established the inter-
play between the intramolecular anharmonicity and the
strong vibron-phonon coupling. We have shown that the
anharmonicity modiﬁes the vibron-phonon interaction
which results in an enhancement of the dressing eﬀect.
Therefore, anharmonic vibrons are more sensitive to the
dressing than harmonic vibrons and are characterized by
smaller eﬀective hopping constants. In addition, we have
shown that both nonlinear sources break the vibron inde-
pendence and favor the occurrence of two kinds of bound
states which the properties strongly depend on the inter-
play between the anharmonicity and the dressing eﬀect.
Such a dependence was summarized in a phase diagram
which characterizes the number as well as the nature of
the bound states as a function of the values taken by the
relevant parameters of the problem. In the harmonic sit-
uation, the two bound states appear as combinations of
states involving the trapping of the two vibrons onto the
same amide-I mode and onto nearest neighbor amide-
I modes. By contrast, the intramolecular anharmonic-
ity reduces the hybridization between these two kinds of
trapping so that the low frequency bound state refers to
the trapping of the two vibrons onto the same amide-I
mode whereas the high frequency bound state character-
izes the trapping onto nearest neighbor amide-I vibra-
tions.
In addition, the anharmonicity strongly reduces
the dispersion of the bound states and thus enhances
their breather-like behavior [19].

To conclude, let us mention that forthcoming works
will be devoted to the fundamental question of the TVBS
lifetime due to the coupling ∆H (Eq. (17)) with the re-
maining phonons. Such a problem was studied in a recent
paper [18] in which the decay of TVBS into either bound
or free states was described by considering a weak vibron-
phonon coupling. However, in the present context, both
the anharmonicity and the dressing eﬀect modify the na-
ture and the number of the bound states as well as the
coupling with the remaining phonons. As a consequence,
a new theory must be performed to characterize the dif-
ferent pathways for the decay of the TVBS.

Appendix A: Unitary transformation to remove
the intramolecular anharmonicity

By assuming that the cubic anharmonicity is one order
of magnitude greater than the quartic anharmonicity, a
perturbative parameter λ is introduced so that the vibra-
tional Hamiltonian of the nth amide-I mode is written as

hn = h(0)

n + λVn + λ2Wn + ....

(A1)

n = ω0b+

n bn, Vn = γ3(b+

where h(0)
n + bn)3 and Wn =
γ4(b+
n + bn)4. The anharmonic terms in Eq.(A1) can be
removed by performing a perturbative unitary transfor-
mation Tn = exp(Sn), where Sn is expanded as

Sn = λS(1)

n + λ2S(2)

n + ...

(A2)

Under this transformation, the Hamiltonian hn becomes

˜hn = h(0)

n + λ(V + [S(1)
n , h(0)

n , h(0)

n ]) +

[S(1

(A3)

Since the required unitary transformation must diagonal-
ize the Hamiltonian, the diagonal terms in Eq.(A3) par-
ticipate in the diagonalization scheme of the Hamiltonian
whereas the non diagonal terms, which must vanish, al-
low us to determine the Sn operator order by order. At
the second order with respect to the anharmonic param-
eters, we obtain

At this step, the full vibron-phonon Hamiltonian H can
be expressed in an improved way by applying the general
n Tn. The transformation
unitary transformation T =
modiﬁes the lateral interaction as well as the vibron-
phonon coupling Hamiltonian leading to the occurrence
of vibron-conserving terms and vibron-nonconserving
terms. Nevertheless, since the internal frequency ω0 is
more than two orders of magnitude greater than the an-
harmonic parameters γ3 and γ4, the nonconserving terms
are weak when compared with the conserving terms and
will be neglected. Such a procedure requires the knowl-
edge of the transformation of the vibron displacement

decimation is applied recursively p times, the neighboring
site of the site m = 1 is pushed to inﬁnity and we thus
obtain an ultimate scaled lattice formed by the two side
sites m = 0 and m = 1, only. The Schrodinger equation
can thus be solved exactly and its two eigenvalues are
expressed as

A TVBS occurs when its frequency is at least equal to
the minimum of the TVFS continuum. This condition is
obtained when λ = λc =
2. At the critical point λ = λc,
the scaled values of the parameter λ satisfy λ(1) = ... =
λ(p) = λc. This parameter λ becomes scale invariant
and is a ﬁxed point of the RG transformation. Indeed,
when the initial lattice dynamics is at a critical point, the
localization length ξ is inﬁnite. No change in the critical
parameters accompanies the length scaling so that the
scaled lattice remains at a critical point.

From Eq.(B3), the scaled values of the parameters at

the critical point are expressed as

Appendix B: Decimation of the two-vibron
Schrodinger equation

For each k value, the two-vibron Schrodinger equation
Eqs. (21)-(23) can be reduced by using a decimation pro-
cedure [37,38]. To proceed, let us rewrite the Schrodinger
equation Eqs. (21)-(23) as

In Eq.(B1), we eliminate the wave functions connected
to the even sites by substituting their expressions in the
Schrodinger equation of the odd sites. Nevertheless we
keep unchanged the ﬁrst two Schrodinger equation asso-
ciated to the defect sites m = 0 and m = 1. We thus
obtain a new set of Schrodinger equations for the odd
sites only, as

Abstract

The coding and noncoding length sequences constructed from a complete genome

are characterised by multifractal analysis. The dimension spectrum Dq and its deriva-

tive, the ’analogous’ speciﬁc heat Cq, are calculated for the coding and noncoding

length sequences of bacteria, where q is the moment order of the partition sum of the

sequences. From the shape of the Dq and Cq curves, it is seen that there exists a clear

diﬀerence between the coding/noncoding length sequences of all organisms considered

and a completely random sequence. The complexity of noncoding length sequences

is higher than that of coding length sequences for bacteria. Almost all Dq curves for

Dq curves for noncoding length sequences are multifractal-like.

It is seen that the

’analogous’ speciﬁc heats of noncoding length sequences of bacteria have a rich variety

of behaviour which is much more complex than that of coding length sequences. We

propose to characterise the bacteria according to the types of the Cq curves of their

noncoding length sequences. This new type of classiﬁcation allows a better understand-

ing of the relationship among bacteria at the global gene level instead of nucleotide

1 Introduction

The rapidly accumulating complete genome sequences of bacteria and archaea provide a

new type of information resource for understanding gene functions and evolution[1].

One can study the DNA sequences with details by considering the order of four kinds

of nucleotides which DNA is assembled, namely adenine (a), cytosine (c), guanine (g), and

thymine (t).

There has been considerable interest in the ﬁnding of long-range correlation (LRC) in
DNA sequences at this level. Li et al[2] found that the spectral density of a DNA sequence
containing mostly introns shows 1/f β behaviour, which indicates the presence of LRC. The

correlation properties of coding and noncoding DNA sequences were also studied by Peng
et al[3] in their fractal landscape or DNA walk model. The DNA walk deﬁned in Ref.[3]

is that the walker steps “up” if a pyrimidine (c or t) occurs at position i along the DNA
chain, while the walker steps “down” if a purine (a or g) occurs at position i. Peng et al[3]

discovered that there exists LRC in noncoding DNA sequences while the coding sequences

correspond to a regular random walk. By doing a more detailed analysis, Chatzidimitriou-
Dreismann and Larhammar[4] concluded that both coding and noncoding sequences exhibit
LRC. A subsequent work by Prabhu and Claverie[5] also substantially corroborates these

2

results. If one considers more details by distinguishing c from t in pyrimidine, and a from g
in purine (such as two or three-dimensional DNA walk model[6] and maps given in Ref.[7]),

then the presence of base correlation has been found even in coding sequences. In view of

the controversy about the presence of correlation in all DNA or only in noncoding DNA,
Buldyrev et al[9] showed the LRC appears mainly in noncoding DNA using all the DNA
sequences available. Alternatively, Voss[8], based on equal-symbol correlation, showed a

power law behaviour for the sequences studied regardless of the percent of intron contents.

Investigations based on diﬀerent models seem to suggest diﬀerent results, as they all look
into only a certain aspect of the entire DNA sequence[10].

The avoided and under-represented strings in some bacterial complete genomes have been
discussed[11, 12, 13]. A time series model of CDS in complete genome has been proposed[14].
Vieira[15] performed a low-frequency analysis of the complete DNA of 13 microbial genomes

and found that their fractal behaviour does not always prevail through the entire chain and

their autocorrelation functions have a rich variety of behaviours including the presence of

anti-persistence.

For the importance of the numbers, sizes and ordering of genes along the chromosome,
one can refer to Part 5 of Lewin[16]. Here one may ignore the composition of the four

kinds of bases in coding and noncoding segments and only considers the rough structure
of the complete genome or long DNA sequences. Provata and Almirantis [17] proposed a

fractal Cantor pattern of DNA. They map coding segments to ﬁlled regions and noncoding

segments to empty regions of random Cantor set and then calculate the fractal dimension of

the random fractal set. They found that the coding/noncoding partition in DNA sequences

of lower organisms is homogeneous-like, while in the higher eucariotes the partition is fractal.

This result seems too rough to distinguish bacteria because the fractal dimensions of bacteria

they gave out are all the same.

Viewing from the level of structure, the complete genome of an organism is made up of

coding and noncoding segments. Here the length of a coding/noncoding segment means the

number of its bases. Based on the lengths of coding/noncoding segments in the complete

genome, one can get two kinds of integer sequences by the following ways:

i) Order all lengths of coding segments according to the order of coding segments in the

3

complete genome. This integer sequence is named coding length sequence.

ii) Order all lengths of noncoding segments according to the order of noncoding segments

in the complete genome. This integer sequence is named noncoding length sequence.

Yu and Anh[18] proposed a time series model for the length sequences of DNA. After

calculating the correlation dimensions and Hurst exponents, it was found that one can get
more information from this model than that of fractal Cantor pattern[17]. The quantiﬁcation

of these correlations could give an insight into the role of the ordering of genes on the
chromosome. Through detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA)[19] and spectral analysis, the
LRC was found in these length sequences[20].

The correlation dimension and Hurst exponent are parameters of global analysis. Global

calculations neglect the fact that length sequences from a complete genome are highly inho-

mogeneous. Thus multifractal analysis is a useful way to characterise the spatial inhomo-
geneity of both theoretical and experimental fractal patterns[21]. It was initially proposed to

treat turbulence data. In recent years it has been applied successfully in many diﬀerent ﬁelds
including time series analysis[22] and ﬁnancial modelling[23, 24]. For DNA sequences, appli-
cation of the multifractal technique seems rare (we have found only Berthelsen et al.[25]).
Recently, Yu et al[26] considered the multifractal property of the measure representation of a

complete genome. In this paper, we pay more attention to the multifractal characterisation

of the coding and noncoding length sequences.

Some sets of physical interest have a nonanalytic dependence of dimension spectrum

Dq on the q-moments of the partition sum of the sequences. Moreover, multifractality has
a direct analogy to the phenomenon of phase transition in condensed-matter physics[27].

The existence and type of phase transitions might turn out to be a worthwhile charac-
terisation of universality classes for the structures[28]. The concept of phase transition

in multifractal spectra was introduced in the study of logistic maps, Julia sets and other

simple systems. Evidence of phase transition was found in the multifractal spectrum of
diﬀusion-limited aggregation[29]. By following the thermodynamic formulation of multifrac-
tal measures, where q represents an analogous temperature, Canessa[23] applied a standard

expression for the ’analogous’ speciﬁc heat and showed that its form resembles a classical

phase transition at a critical point for ﬁnancial time series.

4

In this paper we calculate the ’analogous’ speciﬁc heat of coding and noncoding length

sequences. Our motivation to apply Canessa’s framework to characterise stochastic sequences

is to see whether there is a similar type of phase transition in the coding and noncoding length

sequences as in other time series. We show that based on the shape of the Cq curves and

associated type of phase transitions, one can discuss the classiﬁcation of bacteria. This new

type of classiﬁcation allows to better understand the relationship among bacteria at the

global gene level instead of nucleotide sequence level.

2 Multifractal analysis

Let Tt, t = 1, 2, · · · , N, be the length sequence of coding or noncoding segments in the

complete genome of an organism. First we deﬁne

Ft = Tt/(

Tj)

N

X
j=1

to be the frequency of Tt. It follows that Pt Ft = 1. Now we can deﬁne a measure µ on [0, 1[
by dµ(x) = Y (x)dx, where

Y (x) = N × Ft, when x ∈ [

t − 1
N

,

t
N

[.

It is easy to see that R

1
0 dµ(x) = 1 and µ([(t − 1)/N, t/N[) = Ft.

The most common numerical implementations of multifractal analysis are the so-called
ﬁxed-size box-counting algorithms [30]. In the one-dimensional case, for a given measure µ

with support E ⊂ R, we consider the partition sum

q ∈ R, where the sum runs over all diﬀerent nonempty boxes B of a given side ǫ in a grid

covering of the support E, that is,

The scaling exponent τ (q) is deﬁned by

and the generalized fractal dimensions of the measure are deﬁned as

and

where Z1,ǫ = Pµ(B)6=0 µ(B) log µ(B). The generalized fractal dimensions are numerically
estimated through a linear regression of

Dq = τ (q)/(q − 1),

for q 6= 1,

Dq = lim

against log ǫ for q 6= 1, and similarly through a linear regression of Z1,ǫ against log ǫ for

q = 1. D1 is called the information dimension and D2 the correlation dimension. The Dq of

the positive values of q give relevance to the regions where the measure is large, i.e., to the

coding or noncoding segments which are relatively long. The Dq of the negative values of q

deal with the structure and the properties of the most rareﬁed regions of the measure, i.e.

to the segments which are relatively short.

By following the thermodynamic formulation of multifractal measures, Canessa[23] de-

rived an expression for the ’analogous’ speciﬁc heat as

Cq ≡ −

≈ 2τ (q) − τ (q + 1) − τ (q − 1).

(8)

∂q2

He showed that the form of Cq resembles a classical phase transition at a critical point for

ﬁnancial time series. In the following we calculate the ’analogous’ speciﬁc heat of coding and

noncoding length sequences for the ﬁrst time. The types of phase transitions are helpful to

discuss the classiﬁcation of bacteria.

3 Data and results

More than 31 bacterial complete genomes are now available in public databases. There are

ﬁve Archaebacteria: Archaeoglobus fulgidus (aful), Pyrococcus abyssi (pabyssi), Methanococ-

cus jannaschii (mjan), Aeropyrum pernix (aero) and Methanobacterium thermoautotroph-

icum (mthe); ﬁve Gram-positive Eubacteria: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtub), Mycoplasma

6

pneumoniae (mpneu), Mycoplasma genitalium (mgen), Ureaplasma urealyticum (uure), and

Bacillus subtilis (bsub). The others are Gram-negative Eubacteria, which consist of two

Hyperthermophilic bacteria: Aquifex aeolicus (aquae) and Thermotoga maritima (tmar);

three Chlamydia: Chlamydia trachomatisserovar (ctra), Chlamydia muridarum (ctraM),

and Chlamydia pneumoniae (cpneu); two Spirochaete: Borrelia burgdorferi (bbur) and Tre-

ponema pallidum (tpal); one Cyanobacterium: Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 (synecho); and

thirteen Proteobacteria. The thirteen Proteobacteria are divided into four subdivisions,

which are alpha subdivision: Rhizobium sp. NGR234 (pNGR234) and Rickettsia prowazekii

(rpxx); gamma subdivision: Escherichia coli (ecoli), Haemophilus inﬂuenzae (hinf), Xylella

fastidiosa (xfas), Vibrio cholerae (vcho1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (paer) and Buchnera sp.

APS (buch); beta subdivision: Neisseria meningitidis MC58 (nmen) and Neisseria menin-

gitidis Z2491 (nmenA); epsilon subdivision: Helicobacter pylori J99 (hpyl99), Helicobacter

pylori 26695 (hpyl) and Campylobacter jejuni (cjej).

First we counted out the length of coding and noncoding segments in the complete

genomes of the above bacteria and obtained the coding and noncoding length sequences

of these organisms. For example, we give the coding and noncoding length sequences of

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (paer) in Figure 1.

Then we calculated the dimension spectra Dq and ’analogous’ speciﬁc heat Cq of the

coding and noncoding length sequences of all the above bacteria according to the methods

given in section 2. In order to show the diﬀerence between coding and noncoding length

sequences, we give the Cq curves of length sequences of all the above bacteria as Figure 2

(for 19 bacteria) and Figure 3 (for another 12 bacteria).

The hill behaviour of the dimension spectrum Dq for q < 0 is a well known fact when
using the box-counting method[22, 23]. In Figures 4 and 5, we present Dq of the coding or

noncoding length sequences of all bacteria selected within the range q ≥ 0.

4 Discussion and conclusions

If a length sequence is completely random, then our measure deﬁnition yields a uniform

measure (Dq = 1, Cq = 0).

7

From the curves of Dq and Cq, it is seen that there exists a clear diﬀerence between

the coding/noncoding length sequences of all organisms considered here and the completely

random sequence. Hence we can conclude that complete genomes are not random sequences.

But the Dq values of coding length sequences are closer to 1 than that of noncoding length

sequences. In other words, noncoding length sequences are further away from a complete

random sequence than coding length sequences. The property of the length sequences is
same as that of the DNA sequences[3].

We also found that for each bacterium selected, the Dq values for q > 0 of a noncoding

length sequence are smaller than those of a coding length sequence, but for q < 0, the

situation is reversed. It is well known that the dimension is a measure for complexity. Here

the complexity of noncoding length sequences is higher than that of coding length sequences

for bacteria.

From Figures 4 and 5, almost all Dq curves for coding length sequences are ﬂat, so their

multifractality is not pronounced. On the other hand, almost all Dq curves for noncoding

length sequences are multifractal-like.

In our previous paper[26], we counted out all substrings with ﬁxed length appearing

in the complete genome and gave a measure representation of the complete genome. We

found that the shape of the Cq curves of all bacteria we selected are single-peaked. Hence

this type of phase transition of the measure representation is not useful for classiﬁcation of

bacteria. On the other hand, from Figures 2 and 3, one can see that the ’analogous’ speciﬁc

heats of noncoding length sequences of bacteria have a rich variety of behaviours which is

much more complex than that of coding length sequences. Some have only one main single

peak. In this class, some Cq curves display a shoulder to the right of the main peak, some

display a shoulder to the left of the main peak, and some have no shoulder, which resembles

a classical (ﬁrst-order)phase transition at a critical point. In another class, the Cq curves

display a balance double-peak. So this provides a useful tool for classiﬁcation of bacteria

according to the types of ’analogous’ speciﬁc heats of the noncoding length sequences. The

relevant ﬁnding here is that noncoding length sequences display higher Cq peak heights and

clear double peaked structures than coding length sequences. This reveals diﬀerent types of

long-range correlations between the two classes of sequences. This new type of classiﬁcation

8

allows a better understanding of the relationship among bacteria at the global gene level

instead of nucleotide sequence level. It can be useful to distinguish between sequence curves

as given in the example of Figure 1.

To conclude, multifractal analysis provides a simple yet powerful method to amplify

the diﬀerence between a DNA length sequence and a random sequence. In particular, the

multifractal characterisation given by the ’analogous’ speciﬁc heat allows to distinguish DNA

length sequences in more details.

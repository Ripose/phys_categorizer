Abstract

Surface acoustic waveguides are increasing in interest for (bio)chemical detection.

The surface mass modiﬁcation leads to measurable changes in the propagation prop-

erties of the waveguide. Among a wide variety of waveguides, Love mode has been

investigated because of its high gravimetric sensitivity. The acoustic signal launched

and detected in the waveguide by electrical transducers is accompanied by an elec-

tromagnetic wave; the interaction of the two signals, easily enhanced by the open

structure of the sensor, creates interference patterns in the transfer function of

the sensor. The inﬂuence of these interferences on the gravimetric sensitivity is

presented, whereby the structure of the entire sensor is modelled. We show that

electromagnetic interferences generate an error in the experimental value of the

sensitivity. This error is diﬀerent for the open and the closed loop conﬁgurations

of the sensor. The theoretical approach is completed by the experimentation of an

actual Love mode sensor operated under liquid in open loop conﬁguration. The

modiﬁcations.

1 Introduction

Acoustic waves guided by the surface of solid structures form waveguides used

as delay lines and ﬁlters in telecommunications (1). Waveguides support dif-

ferent modes with speciﬁc strain and stress ﬁelds (2). The acoustic velocity

of each mode depends on diﬀerent intrinsic and extrinsic parameters such

as the mechanical properties of the materials, the temperature or the ap-

plied pressure. Waveguides are used as sensors when the velocity change is

linked to environmental changes. For gravimetric sensors, the outer surface

of the waveguide is exposed to mass changes. Due to the conﬁnement of the

acoustic wave energy close to the surface, these sensors are well suited for

(bio)chemical sensors operating in gas or liquid environments. Among a wide

variety of waveguides used for that purpose, Love mode sensors have attracted

an increasing interest during the last decade (3; 4; 5; 6). A Love mode is guided

by a solid overlayer deposited on top of a substrate material. The usual sub-

strates are piezoelectric materials like quartz, lithium tantalate and lithium

niobate (7). Associated to speciﬁc crystal cut of these substrates, the Love

mode presents a shear-horizontal polarization that makes it ideal for sensing

in liquid media.

Current research in Love mode sensors concerns the guiding materials in order

to obtain a high gravimetric sensitivity. Typical materials under investigations

are dielectrics like silicon dioxide and polymers, and more recently semicon-

ductors with piezoelectric properties like zinc oxide (8; 9; 10; 11). Although

the dispersion relation for Love mode is well set and the dependence of the

gravimetric sensitivity of the liquid loaded sensor to the overlayer thickness

has been thoroughly investigated (12; 13; 14; 15), little has been devoted to

study the role played by the structure of the sensor and the transducers.

In this paper, we investigate the role played by the structure of the sensor

and the interferences between the acoustic and the electromagnetic waves on

the gravimetric sensitivity. In the ﬁrst part, we present a model of the transfer

function including the inﬂuence of electromagnetic interferences. In the second

part, we show how these interferences modify the gravimetric sensitivity in

open and closed loop conﬁgurations of the sensor. Finally, these eﬀects are

illustrated experimentally on a Love mode sensor.

2 Modelling

Waveguide sensors consist of a transducing part and a sensing part. The trans-

ducing part includes the generation and the reception of acoustic signals and

their interfacing to an electrical instrumentation. The most common trans-

ducers are the widespread interdigital transducers (IDTs) on piezoelectric

substrates introduced by White and Voltmer in 1965 (16). Although the trans-

ducing part can be involved in the sensing part, practical sensing is conﬁned to

the spacing between the transducers. This conﬁnement takes especially place

when liquids are involved since these produce large and unwanted capacitive

3

coupling between input and output electrical transducers. This coupling dra-

matically deteriorates the transfer function and is an important issue for the

instrumentation of the sensors.

The sensor is a delay line formed by the transducers and the distance separat-

ing them. Each transducer is identiﬁed to its midpoint. The distance between

the midpoints is L. The sensing part is located between the transducers and

covers a total length D so that D ≤ L. The guided mode propagates with

a phase velocity V = ω/k, where ω = 2πf is the angular frequency and

k = 2π/λ is the wavenumber. The waveguide is dispersive when the group

velocity Vg = dω/ dk diﬀers from the phase velocity.

The velocity is a function of the frequency and of the surface density σ = M/A

for a mass M per surface area A. This surface density can be deﬁned as well in

terms of material density ρ and thickness d by σ = ρd. The phase velocity for

an initial and constant mass σ0 is denoted V0, and the group velocity Vg0. In

the sensing part, the phase velocity is V and the group velocity Vg. According

to this model, the transit time τ of this delay line is given by:

τ =

+

.

Electromagnetic interferences are due to the cross-talk between the IDTs.

The electromagnetic wave (EM) emitted by the input transducer travels much

faster than the acoustic wave and therefore is detected at the output trans-

ducer without noticeable delay. At the output transducer, the two kinds of

waves interact with an amplitude ratio, denoted by α, that creates interfer-

ence patterns in the transfer function H(ω) of the delay line. The transfer

function itself is given by the ratio of the output to the input voltages. The

transfer function with electromagnetic interferences is modelled by the follow-

ing equation:

The transfer function H0(ω) is associated to the design of the transducers.

The total transfer function can be rewritten as H(ω) = kH(ω)k exp (iφ) where

of complex algebra:

The phase φ0 corresponds to the packaging of the sensor and is due to diﬀerent

aspects linked to the instrumentation. It will be assumed independent of the

frequency and of the sensing event. The relations (3) and (4) are the sources

of ripples in the transfer function at the ripple frequency ∆ω = 2π/τ . The

relative amplitude peak to peak of the perturbation on the amplitude has a

maximum eﬀect (in dB) equals to 40 log[(1 + α)/(1 − α)]. The amplitude (in

dB and normalized to have kH0(ω)k = 1) and the phase (in radians) as a

function of the frequency are simulated in Figures 1 to 4 for diﬀerent values

of α.

Under the inﬂuence of the interferences, the phase has diﬀerent behaviors

(1) when α = 0 (no interferences), the phase is linear with the frequency and

has a periodicity equal to 2π (Fig.1);

(2) when α < 1, the phase is deformed but has still a periodicity equal to 2π

(3) when α = 1, the phase has a periodicity equal to π (Fig. 3);

(4) when α > 1, the periodicity is lower than π (Fig. 4);

(5) when α → ∞, the phase is not periodic anymore and its value tends to

This speciﬁc behavior of the phase has to be considered for the evaluation of

the gravimetric sensitivity.

3 Gravimetric sensitivity

Changes in the boundary condition of the waveguide due to the sensing event

modify phase and group velocities. As consequence, the transit time of the de-

lay line and the phase of the transfer function are modiﬁed. The sensing event

is quantiﬁed by recording the phase shift at a ﬁxed frequency (open loop con-

ﬁguration) or the frequency shift at a ﬁxed phase (closed loop conﬁguration).

This quantiﬁcation gives rise to the concept of sensitivity. The sensitivity is the

most important parameter in design, calibration and applications of acoustic

waveguide sensors. Its measurement must be carefully addressed in order to

extract the intrinsic properties of the sensor.

3.1 Sensitivity deﬁnitions

The gravimetric sensitivity SV is deﬁned by the change of phase velocity as a

function of the surface density change at a constant frequency. Its mathemat-

6

ical expression is given by Ref. (14):

SV =

.

∂V
∂σ (cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

The deﬁnition reﬂects the velocity change in the sensing area only while out-

side this area the velocity remains unmodiﬁed. The expression is general be-

cause the initial velocity V of the sensing part does not need to be equal to

V0; this situation occurs in practical situations where the sensing part has a

selective coating with its own mechanical properties, leading to a diﬀerence

between V and V0.

In order to link the gravimetric sensitivity (caused by the unknown velocity

shift) to the experimental values of phase and frequency shifts, we introduce

two additional deﬁnitions related to the open and the close loop conﬁgurations,

respectively. The phase sensitivity Sφ is deﬁned by

and the frequency sensitivity Sω is deﬁned by

In order to point clearly the eﬀects of the electromagnetic interferences on the

diﬀerent sensitivities presented in the previous section, we calculate the phase

diﬀerentials in the ideal case of no interferences. For that case, the phase of the

transfer function is a function of the frequency and the velocity, itself function

of the frequency and the surface density:

is recorded. This conﬁguration with a constant frequency has dω = 0 in

In the absence of interferences, phase variations obtained experimentally are

directly linked to velocity changes by the product kD involving the geometry

of the sensor as seen by replacing Equation (12) in Equation (17):

In other words: Sφ = SV when there are no interferences. In a ﬁrst approxi-

mation k is assumed equal to k0 determined by the periodicity of the inter-

digitated electrodes in the transducer. This assumption is valid as long as the

phase shift is evaluated close to the central frequency ω0 = V0k0 and for waveg-

uides with low dispersion. The wavelength is only known when the sensing part

extends to the transducers (D = L). In that case, the transfer function of the

transducers is modiﬁed as well by the velocity changes. In practice the value

of the sensitivity is slightly underestimated to its exact value since k ≤ k0, the

error being of the order of 5%.

In the case where interferences occur, the partial diﬀerential of φ with respect

to the velocity is obtained by diﬀerentiation of Equation (4):

and the phase sensitivity is obtained by combining the latter equation with

The inﬂuence of electromagnetic interferences on the phase sensitivity is simu-

lated in Figure 5 versus the relative frequency for diﬀerent examples of α. The

phase sensitivity is always diﬀerent compared to the gravimetric sensitivity.

For the threshold value α = 1, the phase sensitivity is half of the gravimetric

sensitivity; for higher values of α, the phase sensitivity is always underesti-

mated to the gravimetric sensitivity.

3.4 Closed loop conﬁguration

In the closed loop conﬁguration, the frequency is recorded while a feedback

loop keeps the phase diﬀerence between output and input transducers con-

stant. To obtain the equivalent type of expression as in the open loop conﬁg-

uration, the total diﬀerential of the phase given by Equation (10) is rewritten

in terms of frequency and surface density:

as a function of the mass change is given by introducing this condition in

When the waveguide is not dispersive, τ ′ = 0 and Equation (23) is simpler.

We can establish a ﬁnalized equation taking into account the electromagnetic

interferences by combining Equations (19) and (23) in Equation (22):

In the absence of interferences, if the waveguide has no dispersion and V =

When the waveguide is dispersive, the transit time τ contains the combined

information of the group velocities in the transducing and sensing part and

the phase velocity in the sensing part. If the sensing part extends to the entire

delay line (D = L) and still in the absence of interferences, we obtain:

In the case where interferences occur, the sensitivity is modiﬁed according to

the value of α and is strongly dependent of the structure of the sensor and

the velocities in the diﬀerent parts of the sensor. A simple expression can

not be deduced easily and the link between the frequency sensitivity and the

gravimetric sensitivity is diﬃcult to exploit.

4 Experimental results

For the practical consideration of the described behavior, we investigated a

Love mode sensor. It was fabricated and tested under liquid conditions to eval-

uate the inﬂuence of the electromagnetic interferences. The Love mode was

obtained by conversion of a surface skimming bulk wave (SSBW) launched in

the direction perpendicular to the crystalline X axis of a 500 µm thick ST-

cut (42.5◦ Y-cut) quartz substrate. The conversion was achieved by a 1.2 µm

thick overlayer of silicon dioxide deposited on the top side of the substrate

12

by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (Plasmalab 100 from Oxford

Plasma Technology, England). Vias were etched in the silicon dioxide layer us-

ing a standard SF6/O2 plasma etch recipe. This process stopped automatically

on the aluminium contact pads of the transducers.

The transducers consist of split ﬁngers electrodes etched in 200 nm thick

sputtered aluminium. The ﬁngers are 5 µm wide and equally spaced by 5 µm.

This deﬁnes a periodicity λ0 of 40 µm. The acoustic aperture deﬁned by the

overlap of the ﬁngers is equal to 80λ0 (= 3.2 mm), the total length of each

IDT is 100λ0 (= 4 mm) and the distance center to center of the IDTs is 225λ0

(L= 9 mm, D= 5 mm).

The sensing area was deﬁned by covering the space left between the edges of

the IDTs by successive evaporation and lift-oﬀ of 10 nm of titanium and 50

nm of gold in a ﬁrst experiment, and 200 nm of gold in a second experiment.

The ﬁngers were protected against liquid by patterning photosensitive epoxy

SU-8 2075 (Microchem Corp., MA) deﬁning 200 µm thick and 80 µm wide

walls around the IDTs. Quartz glasses of 5 by 5 mm2 were glued on top of the

walls to ﬁnalize the protection of the IDTs.

The device was mounted and wire-bonded to an epoxy printed circuit board

and its transfer function was recorded on a HP4396A Network Analyzer. This

setup corresponds to the open loop conﬁguration. Epoxy around the device

covered and protected it and deﬁned a leak-free liquid cell. The sensing area

was immersed in a solution of KI/I2 (4 g and 1 g respectively in 160 ml of

water) that etched the gold away of the surface (17). The transfer function of

the device was recorded every 4 seconds (limited by the GPIB transfer speed)

during the etching of the gold with a resolution of 801 points over a span

13

of 2 MHz centered around 123.5 MHz. The initial transfer function of the

device is presented in Figure 6 with and without gold. The transfer function

during etching of the 200 nm is shown at two moments (44 seconds and 356

seconds after etching start) in Figure 7. The total time for this etching was

approximately 620 seconds. The sensitivity was calculated by etching of 50 nm

of gold and assuming a density ρ = 19.6 g/cm3. The result is plotted versus

the frequency in Figure 8.

5 Discussion

Electromagnetic interferences have a clear eﬀect on the transfer function be-

cause of the ripples they cause. The interaction modelled as a constant factor

α is speciﬁc to each device and must be identiﬁed via a careful inspection of

the transfer function. The amplitude of the transfer function peak to peak

is supposed to be the product between the transfer function of the transduc-

ers and the interference, and therefore an evaluation of α is possible if the

transfer function of the transducers only is known. However, the experiment

shows that α is a function of the frequency and the surface density, indicating

that ﬁnding its exact value is not straightforward. Only the phase indicates

whether α is higher or lower than one.

In term of sensitivity, when α ≥ 1 the phase has a periodicity P in the range 0

to π. We suggest the following correction to the experimental phase sensitivity:

Sφ =

2π
P

1
kD

dφ
dσ

.

(30)

This modiﬁcation gives a better evaluation of the gravimetric sensitivity by

14

stretching the phase of the transfer function to 2π. Only the extraction of P

is not immediate since it depends upon α.

Finally, we must mention that the experimental part is not exactly providing a

diﬀerential surface density dσ. Indeed, etching of 50 nm of gold corresponds to

a surface density change of 98 µg/cm2. This is a relatively large shift compared

to the targeted biochemical recognition application where protein ﬁlms surface

density are in the order of 500 ng/cm2. The evaluation of the sensitivity is

best recorded by adding or etching thin layers of materials and that under the

operating conditions of the sensor, especially if liquids are involved (18).

6 Conclusion

We have proposed a model for surface acoustic waveguides used as sensors.

The model shows the inﬂuence of electromagnetic interferences caused by in-

terdigital transducers on the gravimetric sensitivity in open and closed loop

conﬁgurations. In both cases, the dimensions of the delay line and the sensing

part inﬂuence the experimental value of phase or frequency shifts.

In an open loop conﬁguration and with interferences, the phase shift is dis-

turbed and the sensitivity is over- or under-estimated to the value of the

gravimetric sensitivity. For strong interferences, the phase has a periodicity

lower than 2π that must be considered when normalizing the phase shift to

obtain a correct ﬁgure of the sensitivity.

In a closed loop conﬁguration and with interferences, the frequency shift is

disturbed. The frequency shift is proportional to the sensitivity by the ra-

tio between the length of the sensing area and the distance separating the

15

transducers. In addition, the frequency shift is inﬂuenced by the dispersive

properties of the waveguide.

The inﬂuence of the electromagnetic interferences on the transfer function

of a Love mode sensor operating in liquid conditions was presented for a

comparison. From the experiment it appears that the interferences are function

of both the frequency and the surface density.

For future investigations, an analytical expression of the electromagnetic-

acoustic interaction and the parameters acting on it have to be identiﬁed in

order to reduce the inﬂuence or, on the opposite, to enhance the gravimetric

sensitivity of surface acoustic waveguides.

Fig. 6. Initial aspect of the experimentally recorded transfer function of the Love

mode sensor with (dashed line) and without (solid line) an overlayer of 200 nm of

gold. This device presents an initial phase φ0 = π, leading to a vertical oﬀset by π

compared to the simulated phase curve represented in Fig. 2.

Fig. 7. Aspect of the experimentally recorded transfer function at two diﬀerent

moments of the etching of 200 nm of gold (solid line after 44 seconds and dashed

line after 356 seconds). The solid line shows a value of α close to 1 around 123.5 MHz.

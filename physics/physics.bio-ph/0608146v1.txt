Struture of symmetri and asymmetri (cid:16)ripple(cid:17) phases in lipid bilayers

We reprodue the symmetri and asymmetri (cid:16)rippled(cid:17) Pβ′

states of lipid membranes by Monte

Carlo simulations of a oarse-grained moleular model for lipid-solvent mixtures. The struture and

properties ompare favorably with experiments. The asymmetri ripple state is haraterized by a

periodi array of fully interdigitated (cid:16)defet(cid:17) lines. The symmetri ripple state maintains a bilayer

struture, but is otherwise struturally similar. The formation of both ripple states is driven by the

propensity of lipid moleules with large head groups to exhibit splay.

Membranes are ubiquitous in all living organisms [1℄.

by Tardieu et al. [9℄. The mirosopi struture of this

Their entral strutural element is a lipid bilayer, whih

mysterious phase has been debated for a long time.

is kept together by the amphiphili harater of lipid

moleules (cid:21) they self-assemble suh that their hydrophili

head groups shield the hydrophobi tails from the water

environment. Pure lipid bilayers or monolayers (at the

air-water interfae) have been studied for a long time as

model systems that an provide insight into the stru-

tural properties of biomembranes. Already these seem-

ingly simple systems exhibit a rih spetrum of strutures

and phase transitions [2, 3, 4, 5℄. The most ommon

state in nature is the so-alled (cid:16)(cid:29)uid(cid:17) state (Lα ), whih

is haraterized by a large number of hain defets and

high lipid mobility. If one dereases the temperature, one

enounters a phase transition (the (cid:16)main(cid:17) transition) into

a (cid:16)gel(cid:17) state where the lipid moleules are more ordered

and less mobile. The struture of this low temperature

phase depends on the interations between the lipid head

groups. Loosely speaking, lipids with small head groups

suh as phosphatidylethanolamines [4℄ assume a state

where the long axes of the hains remain perpendiular

to the bilayer normal (Lβ phase). Lipids with large head

groups and relatively strong head-head attration suh as

phosphatidylholines [5℄ exhibit tilt (Lβ′

phase). Finally,

lipids with large head groups and weak head-head at-

tration suh as as ether linked phospatidylholines [5, 6℄

form a phase Lint

β where both opposing lipid layers are

fully interdigitated [4, 5℄.

The main transition has attrated onsiderable in-

terest, sine it ours at temperatures that are simi-

In fat, at least two di(cid:27)erent rippled states have been

reported, whih often oexist [10℄. Eletron density maps

(EDMs) have reently been derived for both of them from

X-ray sattering data [11, 12℄. One of the strutures is

asymmetri and has a sawtooth pro(cid:28)le with alternating

thin and thik arms and a periodiity of 13-15 nms, whih

orresponds to roughly 20 lipid diameters. The other one

is symmetri and has a wavy sinusoidal struture with

twie the period of the asymmetri struture [13℄. The

formation of the ripples depends strongly on the thermal

history [10, 13, 14℄. If the membrane is heated up from

the gel state, asymmetri ripples are obtained.

If one

ools down from the (cid:29)uid state, both types of ripples are

formed (cid:21) predominantly asymmetri ones if the ooling

was fast, and predominantly symmetri ones if the ool-

ing was slow and if a long time was spent at the transition

temperature. Dynamial X-ray [13℄ and AFM [15℄ stud-

ies suggest that the symmetri ripple state is metastable

and very slowly transforms into the asymmetri ripple

state; however, this does not yet seem to be fully settled.

The degree of ordering in the ripple states largely resem-

bles that in the gel state, exept for a ertain amount of

disorder in the struture [2℄ (cid:21) alorimetri studies sug-

gest that approximately 10 % of all hains are melted.

Most strikingly, the self-di(cid:27)usion of lipids in the ripple

states is a few orders of magnitude higher than that in

the gel state, and highly anisotropi [16℄. This has lead

to the assumption that the ripple states might ontain

(cid:16)oexisting(cid:17) gel-state and (cid:29)uid-state lipids.

Numerous theoretial models for the ripple phase have

been proposed, whih explain the ripple formation by dif-

forward. The transition is driven by the ompetition of

ferent mehanisms: Chain paking e(cid:27)ets [17, 18℄, dipolar

the entropy of hain disorder and the free energy of hain

interations [19℄, a oupling of monolayer urvature with

alignment [7, 8℄ (i.e., hain paking) and is thus in some

loal hain melting [20, 21, 22℄ or with tilt [17, 23, 24℄ in

sense related to the isotropi-nemati transition of liquid

ombination with hirality [24℄. This list is far from om-

rystals. At the transition Lα ↔ Lβ′

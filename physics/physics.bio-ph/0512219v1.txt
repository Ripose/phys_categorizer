We use measurements of swimming bacteria in an optical trap to determine fundamental properties
of bacterial propulsion. In particular, we determine the propulsion matrix, which relates the angular
velocity of the ﬂagellum to the torques and forces propelling the bacterium. From the propulsion
matrix, dynamical properties such as forces, torques, swimming speed and power can be obtained
by measuring the angular velocity of the motor. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant heterogeneities among diﬀerent
individuals even though all bacteria started from a single colony. The propulsive eﬃciency, deﬁned
as the ratio of the propulsive power output to the rotary power input provided by the motors, is
found to be 0.2%.

Bacteria swim by rotating helical propellers called ﬂag-
ella. In the case of Escherichia coli (E. coli), each ﬂagel-
lum is several microns in length, 20 nm in diameter and
four to ﬁve of them organize into a bundle. The ﬂagella
are driven at their bases by reversible rotary engines that
turn at a frequency of approximately 100 Hz. Existing
experiments show that these molecular engines are Pois-
son stepping motors consisting of several hundred steps
per revolution [1, 2]. However many essential properties
of bacterial swimming have not been measured, partic-
ularly in intact cells. For example, what is the relation
between the angular velocity of the propellers and the
force propelling the bacteria forward? What fraction of
the ﬂagellar motor power is converted into translational
motion? What variability is there in the swimming ap-
paratus from cell to cell? Some of these fundamental
questions have been addressed in theoretical and numer-
ical work [3, 4, 5], however, direct measurements of in-
tact cells with functional motors and ﬂagella are limited
[6, 7, 8].

Herein, we report an investigation of the fundamen-
tal swimming properties of E. coli using optical tweezers
and an imposed external ﬂow. We measure the force re-
quired to hold the bacterium, and the angular velocities
of the ﬂagellar bundle and of the cell body as a func-
tion of the ﬂow velocity. The propulsion matrix, which
relates the translational and angular velocity of the ﬂag-
ella to the forces and torques propelling the bacterium,
can thus be determined one bacterium at a time. Our
measurements show that although the population aver-
aged matrix elements are in reasonably good agreement
with the resistive force theory for helical propellers [4],
there is a large variability among bacteria from a single
colony. The propulsion matrix also allows us to deter-
mine the propulsive eﬃciency ε, deﬁned as the ratio of
the propulsive power output to the rotary power input,
to be 0.2%. This is consistent with experiments on he-
lical propellers [9] and close to the maximum eﬃciency
It is

ple shapes such as a corkscrew [5]. Our experimental
technique is versatile and can be used to make compar-
ative studies of mutants strains of the same species or of
diﬀerent micro-organisms. Such measurements can shed
new light on how this remarkable ability to swim evolves
among diﬀerent bacterial species.

An important feature of bacterial swimming is that

ary conditions. Theoretical studies, therefore, usually as-
sume that the ﬂagella have very simple geometries such

approach is not to take into account speciﬁc geometries

as the resistance matrix [10]. Choosing the coordinate
system in Fig. 1, Fthrust and v are positive if directed
toward the head of the cell while the sign of ω and Nf l
obeys the right-hand rule, i.e., the ﬂagella is a left-handed
helix. Based on this coordinate system, the coeﬃcients
A, B, and D are positive, proportional to ﬂuid viscosity
η, and depend on the shape and size of the propeller. The
basic physics is that in the absence of an applied torque,
a translating propeller under the inﬂuence of an external
force must rotate, and in the absence of an applied force,
a rotating propeller under the inﬂuence of an external
torque must translate [9]. The above formulation is ap-
plicable to propellers of any shape and size. However, for
the special case of a helical coil, the matrix elements can
be derived from resistive force theory [4]:

This set of equations will be used below to analyze our
data.

We used a non-tumbling strain of bacteria (RP5231)
in our measurements. We were delighted to ﬁnd that
such a bacterium swimming a few microns above a glass
surface could be stably trapped, along its swimming di-
rection, by the optical tweezer [14]. The bacterium can
then be manipulated by an imposed external ﬂow. Fig-
ure 1 illustrates our experimental setup along with the
ﬂow conﬁgurations. A bacterium swimming to the left
(along the +Z direction) is held by a strongly focused
IR laser (λ= 1024 nm). In the absence of the ﬂow, the
bacterium is invariantly held by the tail of the body. The
thrust force and the trapping force are balanced and the
bacterium is stationary with respect to the trap. The
trapping remains stable when a uniform ﬂow in the +Z
direction is applied (U > 0) [15]. The bacterium can also
be trapped at the head of the body, but the ﬂow ﬁeld
must be reversed (U < 0).

To measure the trapping force and the position of the
trapped cell tip, the transmitted IR beam was refocused
by a high numerical aperture condenser (N.A. 1.5) and
projected onto a two-dimensional position sensitive de-
tector (Paciﬁc Silicon Sensor Inc., DL100-7PCBA). The
position of the trapped cell tip with respect to the cen-
ter of the trap is monitored by a PC equipped with a
National Instruments analog-digital converter card (AT-
MIO-16E-2). The conversion rate is 10 kHz at 12-bit
resolution. A non-ﬂagellated bacterium was used to cal-
ibrate the spring constant k of the optical trap by mea-
suring the position of the trapped tip as a function of
the ﬂow U . For the laser intensity (23 mW) used in this

FIG. 2: A typical experimental run for a swimming bacterium
held in the optical trap. An uniform ﬂow U = 10 µm/s
is established in regime I. The ﬂow U is decreased to zero

of a trapped bacterium. We observed large oscillations
overlying a systematic variation of z(t) as the external
ﬂow is changed. These oscillations result from wobbling
of the cell body in response to the rotation of the ﬂagella
bundle [16, 17]. The trapped bacterium was perturbed
by the following sequence of events: In regime I, the bac-
terium is subject to a uniform ﬂow U = +10 µm/s. The
bacterium maintains an average position away from the
center of the trap. In regime II, U is linearly reduced to
zero in 5 s. The average bacterium position shifts system-
atically toward the center of the trap. In regime III, U is
maintained at zero for 5 s, and the average position of the
bacterium relative to the trap is again constant. Finally
in regime IV, the bacterium is released. The position
of the undeﬂected beam in regime IV is taken to be zo,
the center of the optical trap. From regime II we obtain
the net translational drag coeﬃcient A + A0 = k∆z/∆U ,
and in regime III we obtain Fthrust, since Ftrap = Fthrust
when U = 0. We checked that this measurement was re-
producible by returning the ﬂow to U = 10 µm/s rather
than releasing the bacterium after regime III. The bac-
terium returned to within a few percent of its initial av-
erage position.

We extracted the angular velocities Ω and ω using a
Fourier analysis of the time trace x(t) of the transverse
position of the cell body. This transverse signal shows
more pronounced oscillations than z(t). Figure 3(a) dis-
plays a sample power spectrum E(f ) for a short time
trace of 5 s when U = 0 (regime III). The power spectrum

To test the basic physics implied by the propulsion ma-
trix, we measured the dependence of ¯fL and ¯fH on U for
an additional 40 bacteria which were subjected to ﬂow
speeds of U =

early with
U and the result is in good agreement with
Eq. 4b, as predicted by the propulsion matrix formula-
tion. Within the noise of the measurement, no system-
atic change in ¯fH was detected. This is expected since
at low-loads the molecular motor is known to rotate at a
constant angular speed independent of the load [18].

To complete our determination of the propulsion ma-
trix, the semi-minor axis a and length Lcell = 2b of
the bacteria were measured directly by video microscopy
while immobilized in the trap. This allows us to calcu-
late the drag coeﬃcients A0 and D0 for the cell body.
From the time trace z(t), A and B are calculated by
A0 and B = Fthrust/ω when U = 0.

tational drag of the ﬂagella ¯D is much smaller than that

ellar bundles. The resistive force theory for the helix coil
contains four independent parameters: the pitch λ, the
pitch angle Ψ, the length of the helix ℓ, and the radius r
of the ﬁlament, assuming that the viscosity of the ﬂuid
(η = 10−3 P a s) is known. The three matrix elements A,
B, and D in Eqs. 2 however are not suﬃcient to predict
all the four geometric parameters. To make progress, we
assumed that the the pitch angle Ψ is 41o, as determined
by Turner et al. using ﬂuorescently labeled E. coli cells
[7]. This angle also turns out to be remarkably close to
the optimal angle (42o) that maximizes the propulsion ef-
ﬁciency of an ideal helix [4]. Using β = cos2(41o) = 0.57,
Eqs. 2 predict γk = 0.84, λ = 0.9 µm, r = 23 nm, and
ℓ = 6.2 µm. These values are comparable to the ﬂuores-
cent measurements of Turner et al. who found ¯ℓ = 7 µm,
and ¯λ
1 µm for the curly ﬂagella and 2.2 µm for the
normal ones [7]. We can estimate the average number of

This is slightly greater than the ¯N

All important dynamical quantities can be obtained
from our measurements. For example, the average thrust
for U = 0 is ¯Fthrust = ¯B ¯ω = 0.31 pN . The average

We observed that the propulsion matrix elements vary
greatly among individual bacteria even though our bac-
teria are from a single colony. Figure 4 shows the prob-
ability distribution functions (PDF) of the scaled quan-
tities A/ ¯A, B/ ¯B, and D/ ¯D. The standard deviations
σ are comparable to the mean values with σA/ ¯A = 0.7,
σB/ ¯B = 0.5 and σD/ ¯D = 0.3. A conspicuous feature of
all the PDFs is their broad tails, particularly for the lin-
ear drag coeﬃcient A. This might be an indication of ei-
ther signiﬁcant structural heterogeneities in the ﬂagellar
bundles of individual cells or of changes in conformations
of the ﬂagellar bundle with time. As is often the case in

biological systems, the PDFs can be roughly ﬁtted to log-
normal distribution functions, which are plotted as solid
lines in the ﬁgure.

−

Part of the variation in A, B and D must arise due
to bacteria being in diﬀerent stages of their growth cy-
cle during the measurements. This is particularly the
case in the middle log-phase of a growing culture, where
the bacterial size is highly varied. For ease of trapping,
very long and very short bacteria were excluded from the
12 µm),
measurements and the middle-sized bacteria (4
which comprised about 95% of the population, was cho-
sen. The bacterial cell-length distribution of this selected
population is plotted in Fig. 5(a). The ﬁgure also shows
the cell length at which we ﬁrst observed septal rings
(dotted line) and the length at which cells divide (solid
line). We used the bacterial length Lcell as a measure
of the bacterium’s physiological state and determine the
propulsive matrix elements as a function of Lcell. To de-
termine the length dependence of the coeﬃcients A, B,
and D, we calculated the averaged values

These size dependencies allow us to draw conclusions
about the structure of ﬂagellar bundles at diﬀerent stages
of cell growth. Inspection of Eqs. 2 shows that the ma-
λ0,
trix elements scale with the pitch λ according to A
λ2. The fact that we ﬁnd that B
B
and D depend on Lcell but A does not, implies that the
primary Lcell dependence is in pitch λ. The pitch angle
Ψ and the ﬂagella length ℓ are approximately constant
independent of Lcell. Likewise, γk depends logarithmi-
cally on λ and so is only very weakly dependent on Lcell.
Since our measurements show a linear relation between
D and Lcell, it suggests that λ2 grows linearly with Lcell.
A possible scenario for this is that more and more ﬂag-
ella are incorporated into the bundle as the bacteria cell
body grows and this causes the λ2 to grow in agreement
with Fig. 4(c). From the shortest to the longest bacterial
body size (Lcell), we found that the fractional change

δλ/λ is about 16%, which may be discernible in care-
fully conducted observations using ﬂuorescently labeled
bacteria.

We next turn our attention to the power and propulsive
eﬃciency of the swimming bacteria. The average power
output of the ﬂagellar motors is ¯Σ = D0Ω(ω
Ω) =
0.4 pW . The power used to turn the cell body is
D0Ω2
0.02 pW while the actual propulsive power is an-
other factor of ten smaller with A0V 2
0.0017 pW .
Therefore 5% of the rotary power is used to rotate the

swim ≈

cell body, and only 0.5% is used to push the bacteria for-
ward. Figure 5(b) shows the average motor power as a
function of bacterial length Lcell. The power increases
gradually with Lcell, which is consistent with the above
discussion that the number of ﬂagella N and the associ-
ated motors increase with Lcell. The propulsion eﬃciency
ε, deﬁned as the ratio of the propulsive output power to
the rotary input power, can be related to the propulsion
matrix elements [9]:

Here we used B2
D to obtain
the approximate form. These assumptions are met on
average but does not always hold for a particular bac-
terium. Therefore we use the full form to calculate the
eﬃciency. Figure 5(c) shows that the eﬃciency as a func-
tion of bacterial size is constant up to the cell division
length (Lcell = 8 µm). The average eﬃciency ¯ε
0.2%
[19] is surprisingly close to that of sedimenting helices
in a silicon oil, which were tested as model ﬂagella by
Purcell [9]. We can also ask, for a given A0, what is
the maximum eﬃciency attainable by the bacterium as
a function of the length of the ﬂagella. Assume that at
some characteristic length ℓp, the propulsive coeﬃcients
of the ﬂagellum are Ap, Bp and Dp. Neglecting logarith-
mic corrections and assuming the width of the ﬂagellar
bundle is constant, these coeﬃcients should grow linearly
with ﬂagella length ℓ so that A
κBp and
D
κDp where κ = ℓ/ℓp. This assumption is consis-
tent with Eqs. 2. Substituting for A, B and D into
our approximate expression for ε (in Eq. 5) we ﬁnd that
the maximum eﬃciency occurs when A = A0 and that
p/(4ApDp) which depends only on the shape of
εmax ≈
the propeller. The same result was obtained by Purcell
when he maximized ε by assuming that all propeller di-
mensions (not just the length) scaled with κ [9]. In our
experiments, we ﬁnd that A
2A0 and so ﬂagella are
twice as long as that required to maximize its propul-
sive eﬃciency. However, the peak in ε as a function of κ
is fairly broad and the observed eﬃciency is about 75%
of the maximum eﬃciency as shown by the solid and
dashed lines in Fig. 5c. The broadness of the peak may
be why the propulsive eﬃciency is approximately con-
stant throughout the bacterial cell division cycle. The
experimental propulsive eﬃciencies are consistent with
the small εmax of between 0.3%
0.8% measured for he-
lical propellers [9]. It is smaller still than the 1 or 2%
predicted theoretically for a helical propeller [4, 5].

In summary, bacterial propulsion in a uniform stream
is investigated with the help of optical tweezers, which
allow the thrust force Fthrust to be directly measured as

a function of imposed ﬂow. For a free swimming bac-
terium, Fthrust precisely balances the viscous drag of the
cell body A0v and of the ﬂagellar bundle Av. The contri-
bution to the drag by Av is twice as large as Aov but is
diﬃcult to determine without our direct force measure-
ments. We also showed that the propulsion matrix de-
scription proposed by Purcell gives an adequate descrip-
tion of bacterial propulsion over a physiological range of
velocities.
In retrospect, the validity of the propulsion
matrix, or for that matter the resistive force theory it-
self, is not self evident for real micro-organisms because
of possible deformations of ﬂagellar bundles due to hy-
drodynamic stresses induced by swimming or by the ﬂow
[5].

We have determined all elements of the propulsion ma-
trix and used the resistive force calculations for a helical
coil to estimate microscopic properties of ﬂagella [4]. The
results were consistent with earlier measurements even
though the resistive force calculations neglect the eﬀect
of long-range hydrodynamics interactions between diﬀer-
ent parts of the ﬂagella and with the cell body. Using
the propulsion matrix, we have determined all dynamic
quantities related to bacterial swimming and their de-
pendence on the size of the cell body. In particular, we
found that the propulsive eﬃciency ε, deﬁned as the ratio
of the propulsive power output to the rotary power input,
is
0.2% and is nearly independent of Lcell. The mea-
sured ε is consistent with the experiments on rigid helical
propellers [9] and close to the maximum eﬃciency for the
given size of the cell body and the shape of the ﬂagel-
lar bundle. A conspicuous ﬁnding of our measurements
is that all the matrix elements are broadly distributed
despite the fact that all bacteria started from a single
colony. The ubiquity of such broad distributions in bio-
logical systems is signiﬁcant and begs further systematic
study.

ditions for culturing bacteria E. coli strains, RP5231
and YK4516. RP5231 is a smooth swimming strain be-
cause two of its chemotactic genes, CheY and CheZ,
were deleted. A single colony was picked from a fresh
agar plate and grown to saturation overnight in the LB
medium (peptone 4 g, yeast 2 g, NaCl 1 g, 1M NaOH 0.4
ml; for 400 ml of media). The culture was maintained
at 30 oC and was shaken continuously at 200 rpm. The
overnight sample was diluted 1:100 in fresh LB medium
and grown to the middle log phase for 3 hours.

To calibrate the spring constant k of the optical
trap, we used non-ﬂagellated bacteria strain YK4516.
A uniform ﬂow U was applied and the shift in the

centroid of the transmitted IR laser beam was recorded
by the position detector. For an ellipsoid body, the
translational drag coeﬃcient Ao is known and the spring
constant is obtained using k = Ao∆U/∆z. The noise
in the output of the optical trap was 0.1 nm/√Hz (for
zrms = 5.2 nm and sampling rate 10KHz).

[14] We found that it was diﬃcult to stably trap and measure
the force on the bacteria, when it is swimming perpen-
dicular to the optical trap, in the interior of the ﬂuid.
The presence of the surface may have some eﬀect on our
measurements but does not change our qualitative con-
clusions.

[15] We introduced the uniform ﬂow U by translating the
sample chamber using a Newport DC motor controller
(Model 855) and two motorized translation stages. By
controlling the velocities of two oppositely moving stages,
a broad range of U (from 0 to 100 µm/s) can be achieved.

[19] Note that due to the correlation of A, B and D, substi-
tuting the average values ¯A, ¯B, ¯D into Eq. 5 only gives
an eﬃciency of 0.16% instead of 0.2%.

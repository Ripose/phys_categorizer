We consider a model of active Brownian agents interacting via a harmonic attractive potential
in a two-dimensional system in the presence of noise. By numerical simulations, we show that this
model possesses a noise-induced transition characterized by the breakdown of translational motion
and the onset of swarm rotation as the noise intensity is increased. Statistical properties of swarm
dynamics in the weak noise limit are further analytically investigated.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In diﬀerent natural and social systems, agents form
groups characterized by cooperative coherent motion [1].
Such collective swarm motions have been observed and
investigated in bacterial populations [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], in
slime molds [7, 8, 9, 10], for the ants [11, 12] and ﬁsh
[13, 14, 15], in the motion of pedestrians [16] and for the
car traﬃc [17]. To describe these phenomena, various
models of collective coherent motion in populations of
self-propelled or self-driven particles have been proposed
(see [18, 19]). Some of them are formulated in terms
of interacting automata located on a lattice or having
continuous coordinates [20, 21, 22, 23]. A diﬀerent class
of models is based on dynamical equations for individ-
ual self-propelled particles, including velocity-dependent
negative friction terms to account for their active mo-
tion and assuming that interactions between the parti-
cles are described by some binary potentials. This latter
approach has been used to phenomenologically charac-
terize motion of biological organisms [24, 25], individ-
ual blood cells [26, 27] and humans [16, 28], and to de-
scribe the behavior of physical particles with energy de-
pots [29, 30, 31, 32]. Eﬀective dynamical equations with
velocity-dependent friction could be approximately de-
rived for ﬂoating particles which propel themselves by
releasing surfactant into the medium [33]. A contin-
uum approximation to discrete particle models, hydro-
dynamical models of active ﬂuids have been proposed
[19, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38].

The common property of all swarm models is that they
show the emergence of coherent collective ﬂows starting
from a disordered state with random velocity directions
of individual particles (agents). Such kinetic transitions
have been extensively investigated for the automata sys-
tems [20, 39] and in the framework of hydrodynamics
[34, 37]. The ordered states of swarms can represent
simple translational motion or be characterized by vor-
tex ﬂows. Both spatially distributed and localized swarm

∗Electronic address: udo.erdmann@physik.hu-berlin.de

states are possible. In a distributed state, the population
ﬁlls the entire available medium. In contrast to this, the
population forms compact spatial groups in a localized
state. An interesting example of a localized swarm state
is a rotating ﬂock of ﬁnite extent, seen in the simula-
tions of a discrete model of self-propelling particles and
described analytically within a continuum active ﬂuid ap-
proximation [23] (see also [19]).

Localized states of swarms may undergo transitions
leading to new dynamical regimes, when the system pa-
rameters or the noise intensity are gradually changed.
In the previous publication [40], a noise-induced transi-
tion from the localized state with translational motion
to a state with incoherent oscillations without transla-
tional motion was investigated numerically and analyt-
ically for a one-dimensional system of interacting self-
propelled particles. In the present article, we extend in-
vestigations of this system to two spatial dimensions. We
study here a population of self-propelled particles inter-
acting via a parabolic interaction potential corresponding
to linear attracting forces between the pairs. In absence
of noise, this dynamical system has two kinds of attrac-
tors, corresponding, respectively, to a compact traveling
state of the entire population and to a state where it ro-
tates as a vortex without any global translational motion.
The aim of our study is to investigate eﬀects of noise on
translational swarm motion. We ﬁnd that the system
is highly sensitive to stochastic forces. When noise is
present, the traveling swarm is a cloud of particles char-
acterized by diﬀerent dispersions in the directions parallel
and transverse to the direction of translational motion.
Our numerical simulations conﬁrmed by an approximate
analytical study show that the mean-square transverse
dispersion of a swarm is proportional to the square root
of the noise intensity, whereas its dispersion along the di-
rection of motion depends linearly on the noise intensity.
Therefore, for weak noises the swarm looks like a pancake
oriented orthogonally to the motion direction. When the
noise is increased, the swarm gradually acquires a more
symmetric shape. For strong noises, we ﬁnd that the
translational motion of a swarm becomes suddenly im-
possible and is abruptly replaced by a rotational regime
with a vortex ﬂow. The detailed formulation of the model

2

is presented in the next section. In Sect. III we describe
the results of numerical simulations. The statistical prop-
erties of a traveling swarm in the weak noise limit are ap-
proximately explained by an analytical theory which is
constructed in Sect. IV. The paper ends with conclusions
and discussion of obtained results.

II. THE MODEL

We consider a swarm formed by N identical self-
propelled particles of unit mass interacting via an attrac-
tive parabolic pair potential. The dynamics of the system
is given by the following set of evolution equations:

˙ri = vi

˙vi = Fi −

The forces Fi depend on the particle velocity and are
introduced to take into account active motion of particles.
We choose them in the form
Fi = (1

−
so that, in absence of noise and interactions, the particle
acquires the unit velocity v = 1. Additionally, the parti-
cles are subject to stochastic white forces ξi of strength
D which are independent for diﬀerent particles and are
characterized by the correlation functions

This model has previously been introduced in [40]. It
is phenomenological, but rather general because it can be
viewed as a normal form for a population of particles near
a supercritical bifurcation corresponding to spontaneous
onset of active motion (see [19]). In this model, attrac-
tive interactions between particles have an inﬁnite range
and grow linearly with the separation between them. Be-
cause we shall consider only spatially localized states of
the population, our results will hold, however, also for
the situations when interactions are characterized by a
ﬁnite range, but it is much larger than the mean swarm
diameter. It should be noted that, in a diﬀerent context,
the model (1) has been considered already by Rayleigh
[41].

The study of the one-dimensional version of the
model (1) has shown that, as the noise intensity D is in-
creased, spontaneous breakdown of translational swarm
motion takes place here [40]. Some statistical proper-
ties of translational swarm motion in the two-dimensional
model (1) (with a slightly diﬀerent choice of the forces
Fi) have subsequently been discussed [42]. For the case of
two interacting particles (N = 2), the rotational modes
were described in [32], where simulations for small ro-
tating clusters consisting of 20 particles have also been
reported. The aim of the present work is to perform sys-
tematic, numerical and analytical, investigations of the
behavior described by this two-dimensional model.

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

Numerical integration of equations (1) was performed
using the Euler scheme with the constant time step of
0.001. In all simulations, the total number of particles
was ﬁxed to N = 300 and the coeﬃcient a specifying
the strength of interactions between the particles was set
to a = 100. To produce a traveling localized state of
the swarm, special initial conditions were used. At time
t = 0, all particles had identical positions and velocities
and the noise was switched only a little later, at time
t = 30.

Several statistical characteristics of the swarm were
monitored during simulations. The center of mass R of
the swarm and its mean velocity V at time t were deﬁned
as R(t) = (1/N )
vi(t), re-
spectively. Because the cloud of traveling particles in the
presence of noise was anisotropic, we also determined its
instantaneous mean-square dispersions in the directions
parallel (Sk) and orthogonal (S⊥) to the direction of its
instantaneous mean velocity V. They were deﬁned as

ri(t) and V(t) = (1/N )

Figure 1(a) shows the time dependences of the magni-
tude V =
of the mean swarm velocity for two simu-
lations with diﬀerent noises. When the noise is relatively
weak (D = 0.067), its introduction leads to some ﬂuctua-
tions in the instantaneous swarm velocity and a decrease
of its average level. If a stronger noise (D = 0.07) is ap-
plied, the swarm velocity ﬁrst behaves as for the weaker
noise, but then abruptly drops down to a value close to
zero. This sudden transition corresponds to the break-
down of translational motion of the swarm. In Fig. 1(b)
we have plotted the time-averaged swarm velocity
as
the function of the noise intensity D. The average veloc-
ity gradually decreases with noise, until the breakdown
occurs at 0.067 < D < 0.070.

In the state with translational motion at relatively
weak noises, the direction of the swarm motion does not
remain constant with time. The swarm travels along a
complex trajectory, part of which is shown in Fig. 2 (such
trajectories should correspond to the Brownian motion of
the entire swarm). In the inset in this ﬁgure, we display
the distribution of particles in the swarm at some time
moment. It can be noticed that the cloud of particles is
signiﬁcantly squeezed along the direction of swarm mo-
tion.

and transverse (S⊥) dispersions as functions of the noise

the swarm slowly acquires a ring shape, with particles
rotating around its center. This rotating ring structure
corresponds to a state where translational motion of the
entire swarm is already absent.

A diﬀerent visualization of the process, accompanying
the breakdown of translational motion and the transi-
tion to a rotating swarm, is chosen in Fig. 5. Here we
show the trajectory of motion of the center of mass of the
swarm (solid line) together with the trajectory of motion
of one of its particles (dashed line). We see that, in a
traveling swarm, the particles perform irregular oscilla-
tions around its instantaneous mass center. When the
translational motion is terminated and the rotating ring

is formed, such oscillations become transformed into ro-
tations around the ring center.

To provide statistical description of particle motions
in the traveling and rotating states of the swarm, angu-
lar momentum distributions P (L) have been computed.
For the state with translational motion, the distribution
has a single central peak at L = 0 (Fig. 6(a)). In con-
trast to this, in the rotational state the distribution has
two symmetrically placed peaks corresponding to a cer-
tain non-vanishing momentum (Fig. 6(b)). Note that the
particles inside the ring are rotating both in the clock-
wise and counter-clockwise directions, and the numbers
of particles rotating in each direction are approximately
equal. Thus, the swarm does not rotate as a whole and
its total angular momentum remains zero on the aver-
age. This behavior is the consequence of the fact that
only long-range attractive interactions between particles

IV. THE WEAK NOISE LIMIT

Our numerical simulations have shown that, for weak
noises, the swarm is strongly squeezed in the direction
along its center-of-mass motion and its longitudinal and
transverse dispersions are strongly diﬀerent. Below we
derive approximate analytical expressions for Sk and
S⊥in the limit of the small noise intensity D

0.

First, we note that in this limit the motion of the center
of mass of the swarm will remain approximately linear
within very long times or, in other words, the swarm
velocity V remains approximately constant on the short
time scales characteristic for the motions of individual

→

particles inside the traveling swarm. We introduce the
coordinate system in such a way that its x-axis is parallel
to the direction of the swarm motion and its y-axis is
orthogonal to it. The coordinates xi and yi of all particles
forming the swarm can be written as xi = X + δxi and
yi = Y + δyi where X and Y are the coordinates of the
swarm center R. By our choice, we have Y = 0, so that
yi = δyi.

To derive the evolution equation for X, we notice that

the weak noise limit, in contrast to the respective terms
for the longitudinal ﬂuctuations δxi.

are W⊥ = aS⊥ and Wk = aSk. There-
and Wk =
fore, in the considered weak noise limit they are given
by W⊥ = κD1/2 and Wk = D/2. Comparing these ana-
lytical estimates with the simulations in Fig. 7, we ﬁnd
that they agree well with the respective numerical data.
For the transverse dispersion, the agreement is found in a
wide interval of noise intensities. The analytical expres-
sion for the longitudinal dispersion holds, on the other
hand, only for very weak noises.

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied statistical properties of

localized
swarms with long-range attractive interactions in two-
dimensional media. Our numerical simulations show that
the swarm is highly sensitive to the action of noise. Even
very weak noises lead to strong dispersion of the swarm
along the direction orthogonal to the direction of its
translational motion. The approximate analytical the-
ory predicts that the transverse dispersion of aswarm in-
creases as √D with the noise intensity D, whereas its
longitudinal dispersion depends linearly on D in the limit
D
0 and remains therefore much smaller in this limit.
Hence, for weak noises the traveling swarm is strongly
squeezed along the direction of its mass motion. This
analytical result is conﬁrmed by numerical simulations.
Increasing the noise intensity D, we ﬁnd that transla-
tional motion breaks down when a certain critical inten-
sity is reached. After the breakdown, the translational

→

motion is stopped and instead the swarm goes into a rota-
tional mode where the center of mass of the swarm shows
only weak random motion. This behavior resembles the
breakdown of translational motion which was previously
seen for the one-dimensional system [40]. In contrast to
the one-dimensional case, we could not however analyti-
cally treat this transition, because of the strong ﬂuctua-
tions in the transverse direction.

Though our results are obtained in the model with har-
monic attractive interactions, they are also be applicable
for the models with ﬁnite-range attractive interactions
between the particles, provided that the size of a localized
swarm (i.e., the statistical dispersion of the coordinates
of its particles with respect to the mass center) is much
smaller than the interaction radius. In this situation, a
harmonic approximation of the interaction potential can

7

be applied. Moreover, similar eﬀects can be expected for
swarms in three-dimensional media. It would be inter-
esting to see whether the discussed behavior is indeed
characteristic for real biological swarms with long-range
interactions between individual organisms, such as bird
ﬂocks or ﬁsh schools.

Two models for energy and charge transport and storage in biomolecules are considered. A
model based on the discrete nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation with long-range dispersive interactions
(LRI’s) between base pairs of DNA is oﬀered for the description of nonlinear dynamics of the DNA
molecule. We show that LRI’s are responsible for the existence of an interval of bistability where
two stable stationary states, a narrow, pinned state and a broad, mobile state, coexist at each value
of the total energy. The possibility of controlled switching between pinned and mobile states is
demonstrated. The mechanism could be important for controlling energy storage and transport in
DNA molecules. Another model is oﬀered for the description of nonlinear excitations in proteins
and other anharmonic biomolecules. We show that in the highly anharmonic systems a bound state
of Davydov and Boussinesq solitons can exist.

Key words: bistability, long-range dispersion, bound state, anharmonic, nonlocal, soliton.

I. INTRODUCTION

Understanding how biological macromolecules (pro-
teins, DNA, RNA, etc.) function in the living cells re-
mains the major challenge in molecular biology. One
of the most important questions is the mechanism of
gene expression. The expression of a given gene involves
two steps: transcription and translation. The transcrip-
tion includes copying the linear genetic information into
the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). The informa-
tion stored in mRNA is transferred into a sequence of
aminoacids using the genetic code. mRNA is produced
by the enzyme RNA-polymerase (RNAP) which binds
to the promoter segment of DNA. As a result of the in-
teraction between RNAP and promoter of DNA the so-
called ”bubble” (i.e. a state in which 10–20 base pairs
are disrupted) is formed. The disruption of 20 base pairs
corresponds to investing some 100 kcal/mole (0.43 eV)
[1].

In the framework of a linear model the large-amplitude
motion of the bases was supposed to occur due to an in-
terference mechanism [2]. According to this model ener-
getic solvent molecules kick DNA and create elastic waves
therein. As a result of the interference of two counter

propagating elastic waves, the base displacements may
exceed the elasticity threshold such that DNA undergoes
a transition to a kink form which is more ﬂexible. A sim-
ilar approach was also proposed in Refs. [3,4]. The linear
elastic waves in DNA are assumed to be strong enough to
break a hydrogen bond and thereby facilitate the disrup-
tion of base pairs. In spite of the attractiveness of this
theory, which gives at least a qualitative interpretation
of the experimental data [5], there are the following fun-
damental diﬃculties which to our opinion are inherent
in the linear model of the DNA dynamics: (i) The dis-
persive properties (the dependence of the group velocity
on the wave length) of the vibrational degrees of free-
dom in DNA will cause spreading of the wave packets
and therefore smear the interference pattern. Further-
more, it has been shown [6] that the amplitudes of the
sugar and the base vibrations are rather large even in a
crystalline phase of DNA. Since the large-amplitude vi-
brations in the molecules and the molecular complexes
are usually highly anharmonic their nonlinear properties
can not be ignored; (ii) Molecules and ions which exist in
the solution permanently interact with DNA. These in-
teractions are usually considered as white noise and their
inﬂuence is modelled by introducing Langevin stochas-

1

tic forces into the equations describing the intramolec-
ular motion. It is well known [7] that stochastic forces
provide relaxation of linear excitations and destroy their
coherent properties. Equivalently the coherence length
(the length of the concerted motions) rapidly decreases
with increasing temperature; (iii) DNA is a complex sys-
tem which has many nearly isoenergetic ground states
and may therefore be considered as a ﬂuctuating aperi-
odic system. DNA may have physical characteristics in
common with quasi-one-dimensional disordered crystals
or glasses. However, it is known [8] that the transmission
coeﬃcient for a linear wave propagating in a disordered
chain decreases exponentially with the growth of the dis-
tance (Anderson localization). In this way it is diﬃcult
to explain in the framework of linear theory such a phe-
nomenon as an action at distance, where concerted mo-
tion initiated at one end of a biological molecule can be
transmitted to its other end.

The above mentioned fundamental problems can be
overcome in the framework of nonlinear models of DNA.
Nonlinear interactions can give rise to very stable excita-
tions, called solitons, which can travel without changing
their shape. These excitations are very robust and impor-
tant in the coherent transfer of energy [9]. For realistic
interatomic potentials the solitary waves are compressive
and supersonic. They propagate without energy loss, and
their collisions are almost elastic.

Nonlinear interactions between atoms in DNA can
give rise to intrinsically localized breather-like vibra-
tion modes [10,11]. Such localized modes, being large-
amplitude vibrations of a few (2 or 3) particles, can facil-
itate the disruption of base pairs and in this way initiate
conformational transitions in DNA. These modes can oc-
cur as a result of modulational instability of continuum-
like nonlinear modes [12], which is created by energy ex-
change mechanisms between the nonlinear excitations.
The latter favors the growth of the large excitations [13].
Nonlinear solitary excitations can maintain their over-
all shape on long time scales even in the presence of the
thermal ﬂuctuations. Their robust character under the
inﬂuence of white noise was demonstrated [14] and a sim-
pliﬁed model of double-stranded DNA was proposed and
explored. Quite recently the stability of highly localized,
breather-like, excitations in discrete nonlinear lattices
under the inﬂuence of thermal ﬂuctuations was investi-
gated [15]. It was shown that the lifetime of a breather
increases with increasing nonlinearity, and in this way
these intrinsically localized modes may provide an exci-
tation energy storage even at room temperatures where
the environment is strongly ﬂuctuating.

Several theoretical models have been proposed in the
study of the nonlinear dynamics and statistical mechan-
ics of DNA (see the very comprehensive review [16]). A
particularly fruitful model was proposed by Peyrard and
Bishop [17] and Techera, Daemen and Prohofsky [18]. In
the framework of this model the DNA molecule is con-
sidered to consist of two chains that are transversely cou-
pled. Each chain models one of the two polynucleotide

±

strands of the DNA molecule. A base is considered
to be a rigid body connected with its opposite partner
through the hydrogen-bond potential V (un), where un is
the stretching of the bond connecting the bases, n, and
n = 0,
2, .. is labelling the base-pairs. The stretch-
ing of the n′th base-pair is coupled with the stretch-
ing of the m′th base-pair through a dispersive potential
U (un, um). The process of DNA denaturation was stud-
ied [17,19] under the assumption that the coupling be-
tween neighboring base-pairs is harmonic U (un, un+1).
An entropy-driven denaturation was investigated [20]
taking into account a nonlinear potential U (un, un+1) be-
tween neighboring base-pairs. The Morse potential was
chosen [17,19,20] as the on-site potential V (un), but also
the longitudinal wave propagation and the denaturation
of DNA has been investigated [14] using the Lennard-
Jones potential to describe the hydrogen bonds.

−

In the main part of the previous studies the disper-
sive interaction U was assumed to be short-ranged and
a nearest-neighbor approximation was used. It is worth
noticing, however, that one of two hydrogen bonds which
is responsible for the interbase coupling, namely the hy-
drogen bond in the N
H...O group, is characterized by a
ﬁnite dipole moment. Therefore, a stretching of the base-
pair will cause a change of the dipole moment, so that the
excitation transfer in the molecule will be due to transi-
tion dipole-dipole interaction with a 1/r3 dependence on
the distance, r. It is also well known that nucleotides in
DNA are connected by hydrogen-bonded water ﬁlaments
[21,22].
In this case an eﬀective long-range excitation
transfer may occur due to the nucleotide-water coupling.
In the last few years the importance of the eﬀect of
long-range interactions (LRI) on the properties of non-
linear excitations was demonstrated in several diﬀerent
areas of physics [23–28]. Quite recently [29], we proposed
a new nonlocal discrete NLS model with a power depen-
dence on the distance of the matrix element of the disper-
sive interaction. It was found that there is an interval of
bistability in the NLS models with a long-range disper-
sive interaction. One of these states is a continuum-like
soliton and the other is an intrinsically localized state.

Another model, which we consider in this paper, de-
scribes an excitation energy (or excess electron) trans-
port in a highly anharmonic molecular chain. This line
of investigation is rather new, since until recently most
attention has been concentrated on strongly elastic sys-
tems, such as the excitons in the α-helix proteins. The
subsonic Davydov solitons can exist in this case, and the
harmonic approximation is enough for a consideration
of the lattice deformation caused by the exciton [30,31].
But if the lattice is not supposed to be rigid or if the mo-
tion of the excitation at supersonic velocities is studied,
the deformation cannot be considered small and anhar-
monic terms must be taken into account. For example,
the anharmonic interactions play an important role in
the dynamics of DN A.
It is possible that they might
concentrate vibrational energy in DN A into soliton-like
objects [14,32].

2

The anharmonic Davydov model of the molecular
chain has already been much studied during the last ﬁf-
teen years [30,33–39]. It is well known that there exist
solitons of Davydov type and of Boussinesq type in the
system. P´erez and Theodorakopoulos [40] investigated
numerically an interaction between these solitons in the
α-helix proteins, and concluded that it inhibits the sta-
bility of the Davydov vibrational soliton at room temper-
ature. But the eﬀective anharmonicity parameter in that
system is rather small. The recent investigations on the
subject [36–39] demonstrated that in highly anharmonic
chains (e.g. in the problem of excess electron transfer in
α-helix proteins), the interaction between Davydov and
Boussinesq solitons changes its sign, and the solitons can
form a bound state.

The outline of the paper is the following. In Sec. II
we investigate the eﬀects of long-range interactions on
the nonlinear dynamics of the two-strand model of DNA.
First, we reduce the equations of motion of the model to
the nonlocal discrete nonlinear Schr¨odinger (NLS) equa-
tion. Then, we present the analytical theory and the re-
sults of numerical simulations of the discrete NLS model
with a long-range dispersive interaction. We obtain sta-
tionary localized solutions, demonstrate the existence of
the bistability phenomenon, and discuss their stability.
The investigation of the switching between bistable states
completes the section. We show that a controlled switch-
ing between narrow, pinned states and broad, mobile
states with only small radiative losses is possible when
the stationary states possess an internal breathing mode.
In Sec. III we investigate the anharmonic Davydov model
of the molecular chain and show that it reduces to the
H´enon - Heiles system [41], which is completely inte-
grable at some ﬁxed value of anharmonicity. There are
three types of stationary solitons in this case: Boussi-
nesq, Davydov, and a new type, namely a supersonic
two-bell shaped soliton. We calculate the energies of the
solitons. Then, we develop a variational approach for the
non-integrable case. We show that in the case of highly
anharmonic chains, the two-bell shaped soliton is an os-
cillating bound state of Davydov and Boussinesq solitons.
This bound state is caused by the excitation (or electron)
tunnelling in the eﬀective two-well potential which is cre-
ated by the exciton (electron) – phonon interaction and
anharmonic terms in the lattice potential. On the con-
trary, at small anharmonicity Davydov and Boussinesq
solitons repel each other, and the bound state cannot ex-
ist. Finally, we test the dynamical stability of the bound
state at various values of anharmonicity numerically.

tions. In the case of the DNA molecule the long-range in-
teraction is evolved from the existence of charged groups
in the DNA molecule. To take into account a possibil-
ity of screening of the interaction or an indirect coupling
between base-pairs (e.g. via water ﬁlaments), we shall
consider also the case when the matrix element of the

One can see that there is a critical value scr = 2.72
of the dispersion parameter s which separates two qual-
itatively diﬀerent regions. The region s > scr is char-
acterized by the usual monotonic behavior of the soliton
energy vs number of excitations N . Thus the main fea-
tures of all discrete NLS models with dispersive inter-
−scr coincide

qualitatively with the features obtained in the nearest-
neighbor approximation where only one stationary state
exists for any N . But for 2 < s < scr the bifurcation
“swallow tail” takes place introducing a multistability
into the system. One can see that in this case there is
an energy interval where for each value of
there exist
three stationary states with diﬀerent excitation numbers.
The direct numerical solution of Eq. (17) validates this
conclusion and gives the precise critical value scr = 3.03.
It is noteworthy that similar results are obtained for the
Kac-Baker dispersive interaction (6).
In this case the
multistability takes place for β < 1.70.

Figure 2 shows the dependence N (Λ) obtained numer-
ically for σ = 1. This dependence demonstrates the same
transition from the monotonic behavior for s > scr to the
non-monotonic (
-type) behavior for s < scr and assists
to determine the stability of the stationary states. Ac-
cording to the theorem which was recently proven [45],
the necessary and suﬃcient linear stability criterion for
the stationary states is

Therefore we can conclude that only two stationary
states are stable. The third state, with intermediate
value of Λ and maximal value of energy, is unstable. Thus
it is reasonably to talk about bistability of the system.

The observed bistability is very similar to the one re-
cently observed [45,46], where the nearest-neighbor case
with an arbitrary degree of nonlinearity σ was studied.

of the multistability regime there is a well-deﬁned thresh-
old value θth, such that when the initial phase torsion is
smaller than θth, periodic, slowly decaying ’breather’ os-
cillations around the initial state will occur, while for
strong enough kicks (phase torsions larger than θth) the
state switches into the other stable stationary state.

The bistability appears in this case for σ above a certain
critical value.

Figure 3 shows that the shapes of these solutions dif-
fer signiﬁcantly. The low-frequency states are wide and
continuum-like, while the high-frequency solutions repre-
sent intrinsically localized states with a width of a few
lattice spacings.

Now we turn to discuss stationary states of the discrete
NLS model given by Eq. (17) with arbitrary degree of
nonlinearity. The main properties of the system remain
unchanged, but the critical value scr of the dispersion pa-
rameter is now a function of σ. The results of analytical
consideration conﬁrmed by simulation show that scr in-
creases with increasing σ. In particular, for σ
1.4 (the
value at which the discrete symmetrical ground state can
be unstable in the nearest-neighbor approximation [45])
the bistability in the nonlinear energy spectrum occurs
even for s

C. Switching between bistable states

Having established the existence of bistable station-
ary states in the nonlocal discrete NLS system, a natural
question that arises concerns the role of these states in
the full dynamics of the model. In particular, it is of in-
terest to investigate the possibility of switching between
the stable states under the inﬂuence of external pertur-
bations, and what type of perturbations that could be
used to control the switching. Switching of this type is
important in the description of nonlinear transport and
storage of energy in biomolecules like the DNA, since a
mobile continuum-like excitation can provide action at
distance, while the switching to a discrete, pinned state
can facilitate the structural changes of the DNA [5,16].

An illustration of how the presence of an internal
breathing mode can aﬀect the dynamics of a slightly per-
turbed stable stationary state is given in Figures 4 and 5.
To excite the breathing mode we apply a spatially sym-
metrical, localized perturbation, which we choose to con-
serve the number of excitations in order not to change the
eﬀective nonlinearity of the system. The simplest choice,
which we have used in the simulations shown here, is to
kick the central site n0 of the system at t = 0 by adding
a parametric force term of the form θδn,n0 δ(τ )ψn(τ ) to
the left-hand-side of Eq. (14). All details and a physical
motivation of the appearance of such kind of parametric
kick are described in Ref. [44]. As can be easily shown,
this perturbation aﬀects only the site n0 at τ = 0, and re-
sults in a ’twist’ of the stationary state at this state with
an angle θ, i.e. ψn0 (0) = φn0 eiθ. The immediate conse-
quence of this kick is, as can been deduced from the form
2

will be positive (negative)

of Eq. (14), that

when θ > 0 ( θ < 0). Thus, to obtain switching from
(cid:1)
the continuum-like state to the discrete state we choose
θ > 0, while we choose θ < 0 when investigating switch-
ing in the opposite direction. We ﬁnd that in a large part

It is worth remarking that the particular choice of per-
turbation is not important for the qualitative features
of the switching, as long as there is a substantial over-
lap between the perturbation and the internal breathing
mode. We also believe that the mechanism for switching
described here can be applied for any multistable system
where the instability is connected with a breathing mode.

For example, we observed [47] a similar switching behav-
ior in the nearest neighbor discrete NLS equation with a
higher degree of nonlinearity σ, which is known [45] to
exhibit multistability.

the equations of motion (29) and (30) are similar to that
of the H´enon-Heiles system [41] except for the sign in
front to ϕ2 in Eq. (30). This similarity has been used
in our investigations [35,36,39] of the system — we shall
review the results in what follows. An alternative ap-
proach to the problem has been developed recently by
Zolotaryuk, Spatschek, and Savin [37,38].

B. The soliton solutions in the completely integrable
case

It is well known that in a general case the H´enon-Heiles
system [41] is not completely integrable. However in the
following three cases [48]:

(i) A = 4B , g = 1 ,
(ii) 4A = B , g = 16 ,
(iii) g = 6 and arbitrary A and B ,

there exists a second integral of motion, and thus it is a
Liouville completely integrable system. The conditions
(i) and (ii) can be satisﬁed for only one value of the soli-
ton velocity, since the normalization condition (27) im-
poses a link between parameters A and B. But we intend
to investigate how the soliton energy and shape depend
on the soliton velocity. Therefore we shall consider here
only the third case. It was shown in Refs. [35,36] that in
this case there exist only three types of soliton solutions
of Eqs. (29) and (30), namely:

(a) The Boussinesq soliton:

This solution was found analytically and studied numeri-
cally in Refs. [35,36], where it was interpreted as a bound
state of Davydov and Boussinesq solitons.
It was also
found numerically in Refs. [37,38] where the authors be-
lieve, in contrast to our conclusion, that it is a bound
state of a Davydov soliton with two Boussinesq solitons.
It is interesting to note that the deformation function
(35) has the form of the two-soliton solution of the KdV–
equation [49]. So we can conclude that the excitation
ϕ(ϑ) is similar to that of a quantum particle moving in
2u(ϑ) (see Figure 6). One of the
two-well potential
wells is created by the lattice soliton, and the second is
caused by the interaction of the excitation with the lat-
tice. Part of the time the particle lives in the well that
was dug by itself, then it tunnels to the well that was cre-
ated by the lattice soliton, and so on. As a result of such
a complicated behavior we obtain a wave function ϕ(ϑ)
in the form of Eq. (34) (see Figure 6). It is interesting to
remark that at the velocity within the range

−

v0 < v < v0[1 + (∆2/54)1/3]1/2 ,

(36)

−

the wave function of the soliton has the one-bell shape
at any distance R between the wells in the poten-
tial
2u(ϑ). On the contrary, if the velocity exceeds
v0[1 + (∆/2)2/3]1/2 we obtain the two-bell shape at any
R. However, the ratio of the soliton maximal values in
1/√B.
this case is proportional to sech√AR at
Thus we may conclude that the excitation (or electron)
lives mostly in the well that was dug out by itself, tun-
nelling to the other well with an exponentially small rate.

Finally the energy of the two-bell shaped soliton turned
out to be an exact sum of the energies of the Davydov

It is interesting that this energy does not depend on the
distance R.
It means that at g = 6 the Davydov and
Boussinesq solitons do not interact. However, as it will
be shown below they interact in the non-integrable case

C. Variational approach in the non-integrable case

In what follows we shall develop a variational approach
to the investigation of the behavior of the two-bell shaped
solitons in the anharmonic chain far from the completely
integrable case. Considering the Hamiltonian (25), one
can see that the Lagrangian of the chain has the form

FIG. 8. Numerical calculations of the dynamics of two-bell
shaped solitons for g = 8.5 at diﬀerent moments of dimension-
less time: (a) τ = 0, (b) τ = 1550, (c) τ = 3510, (d) τ = 5400,
(e) τ = 6460. The boundary conditions are periodic.

Thus, we can conclude that in highly anharmonic
molecular chains, there should exist a bound state of
Davydov and Boussinesq solitons. The dynamical sta-
bility of this bound state has been tested numerically.
In Figure 8 we present the results of numerical simu-
lations for g = 8.5. As an initial state we chose an

10

asymmetric two-bell shaped soliton. One can see that as
time increases, the bells approach each other and their
heights (as well as the depths of wells) equalize. There-
after, the distance between the bells increases, and a mir-
ror reﬂected asymmetric two-bell shaped soliton appears.
Thus, the Davydov and Boussinesq solitons form a rather
stable bound state and demonstrate an oscillating motion
in accordance with Eq. (45).

≃

In conclusion, we note that for the Davydov vibrational
soliton motion in the α–helix molecule the parameter
g
0.8, so that the bound state of supersonic Davydov
and Boussinesq soliton cannot exist. But for the elec-
tron motion in the polypeptide molecule we get g
12.
Thus we arrive at the conclusion that the bound state
of the supersonic Davydov electrosoliton and the Boussi-
nesq soliton can exist in the α–helix biopolymers.

≥

IV. CONCLUSION

We have considered two models for energy and charge
transport and storage in biomolecules.
In these mod-
els we took into account the long-range dispersive (ﬁrst
model) and anharmonic (second model) interactions, and
showed that these interactions are responsible for the ex-
istence of new types of excitations.

We have proposed a new nonlocal discrete nonlinear
Schr¨odinger (NLS) model for the modelling of the non-
linear dynamics of the DNA molecule with long-range
(r−s and e−βr) dispersive interaction between its charged
groups. We have shown that when the long-range interac-
tions decay slowly, there is an energy interval where two
stable stationary states exist at each value of the Hamil-
tonian
. One of these states is a continuum-like soliton
and the other one is an intrinsically localized mode. By
this means a bistability phenomenon came into existence
in the system. This phenomenon is a result of the com-
petition of two length scales: the usual scale of the NLS
model, which is related to the competition between non-
linearity and dispersion (expressed in terms of the ratio
N/J), and the radius of the long-range interactions.

H

We have shown that a controlled switching between
narrow (pinned) states and broad (mobile) states is pos-
sible. Applying a perturbation in the form of a paramet-
ric kick, we demonstrated that switching occurs beyond
some well-deﬁned threshold value of the kick strength.
The particular choice of perturbation is not important
for the qualitative features of the switching, as long as
there is a substantial overlap between the perturbation
and the internal breathing mode. Thus, we believe that
the mechanism for switching described here can be ap-
plied for any multistable system where the instability is
connected with a breathing mode. The switching phe-
nomenon could be important for controlling energy stor-
age and transport in DNA molecules.

The second model is proposed for modelling of anhar-
monic biological macromolecules. We have shown that

when the value of the eﬀective (dimensionless) anhar-
monicity parameter is large enough, a bound state of
Davydov and Boussinesq solitons can exist. For the
Davydov vibrational soliton motion in the α–helix pro-
teins the anharmonicity parameter is too small, so that
the bound state cannot exist. But for the excess elec-
tron motion in the polypeptide molecule it is rather large,
and a bound state of the supersonic Davydov electrosoli-
ton and the Boussinesq soliton can be formed. Further-
more, a slightly generalized version of the DN A model
[14] which takes into account next neighbors transversal
interactions between Toda chains actually yields strong
anharmonicity. Hence there is a wide range of values for
the anharmonicity parameter g occurring in real systems.

Abstract

Understanding functional associations among genes discovered in sequencing projects is a key issue in

post-genomic biology [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. However, reliable interpretation of the protein interaction data has

been difﬁcult [8, 9]. In this work, we show that if two proteins share signiﬁcantly larger number of common

interaction partners than random, they have close functional associations. Analysis of publicly available

data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals more than 2800 reliable functional associations, 29% of which

involve at least one unannotated protein. By further analyzing these associations, we derive tentative func-

tions for 81 unannotated proteins with high certainty.

A large number of genes discovered in sequencing projects remain functionally unannotated,

motivating signiﬁcant research in post-genomic biology. High-throughput experiments such as

genome-wide monitoring of mRNA expressions as well as protein-protein interaction networks

are expected to be fertile sources of information to derive their functions [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

However, a high rate of false positives [8, 9] as well as the sheer volume of the data are making

reliable interpretation of these experiments difﬁcult.

In this work, we are able to overcome these difﬁculties by using a statistical method that forms

reliable functional associations between proteins from noisy genome-wide interaction data. Our

method ranks the statistical signiﬁcance of forming shared partnerships for all protein pairs in the

interaction network and shows that if two proteins share signiﬁcantly larger number of common

partners than random, they have close functional associations. In the supplement, we derive more

than 2800 pairs of high quality associations for S. cerevisiae involving 852 proteins. The method

is not overly sensitive from the false positives widely present in the two-hybrid data. Even after

adding 50% randomly generated interactions to the measured dataset, we are able to recover almost
all (∼ 90%) of the original associations. The modular nature of the interaction network [10] is

revealed by the clustering of these associations. From the derived modules, we are able to predict

functions for 81 unannotated proteins with high certainty. It has been an encouraging sign that the

functions of some of these proteins were recently annotated by the SGD database [11] from other

sources after the completion of our work, and all but one (22 out of 23) of our predictions proved

to be correct.

Our strategy of assigning statistical signiﬁcance is to compare the measured protein interaction

network with a random network of the same size [12, 13, 14]. The deviation of the measured

network from randomness is presumed to reﬂect its biological signiﬁcance. Non-random nature of

the large-scale protein interaction network has been discussed in earlier work [12, 13, 15]. In one

example, it was observed that the connectivities of the proteins in the measured interaction net-

works closely followed a power-law distribution instead of the exponential distribution expected

from random networks [9, 12, 13, 15]. Useful biological prediction regarding the lethality of

the null mutants lacking those highly connected proteins could be made from such non-random

behavior [12].

We hypothesize that if two proteins have signiﬁcantly larger number of common interaction

partners in the measured data-set than what is expected from a random network, it would suggest

close functional links between them. To validate this hypothesis, we rank all possible protein pairs

FIG. 1: Probabilities of associations for all possible protein pairs derived using our method. Solid black line:

network keeping its power-law connectivity property unchanged [13]. The probabilities of associations for

the measured network are up to 40 orders of magnitude lower than the random networks.

in the order of their probabilities [16] for having the experimentally measured number of common

interaction partners. If the computed probability is extremely small, it signiﬁes that the chosen

protein pair has an unusually large number of common partners. Such pairs are considered for

further analysis, as we discuss in the paper.

The described method is applied on the available experimental data from budding yeast (S.

cerevisiae) collected in the DIP database from several sources [17, 18]. In Fig. 1, we show a plot

with probabilities for all protein pairs in the network sorted in increasing order. For comparison,

we also show corresponding probabilities for a random network of similar size, as well as a ran-

domized version of the measured network. The random network has the same number of nodes

and edges as the measured network, but the connections are made from a uniform distribution.

The randomization of the experimental network is done using a method similar to Ref. [13]. The

method allows us to maintain the power-law nature of the network. As we observe from the plot,

the probabilities of some of the associations in the measured network are up to 40 orders of mag-

nitude lower than both of the randomly constructed networks. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that

those associations are not artifacts due to experimental noise, but contain biologically meaningful

information. It is also clear from the plot that such low probability associations did not arise from

the scale-free nature of the network [12].

To understand what biological information is provided by such low-probability pairs, we in-
spect all pairs with probabilities below a cutoff value of 10−8 [19]. The detailed list is provided

as a supplement [20] as well as from our website [21]. The group consists of 2833 protein pairs

involving 852 proteins. A strong functional link is observed among proteins in these pairs thus

validating our hypothesis. This is illustrated in Table I, where we present the ten pairs with the

lowest probabilities. As we can see from the table, both proteins usually either belong to the same

complex or are parts of the same functional pathway. Same trend is generally true for the larger

dataset presented in the supplement. By manually inspecting the top 100 pairs, we found that in

over 95% of them both proteins have similar function.

We can take advantage of the above observation to predict the functions of the unannotated

proteins. About 29% of the 2833 chosen pairs contain at least one unannotated protein [22].

To assign a function to any one of them, we determine the other proteins with which it forms

associations. As an example, in Table II we show that the unannotated protein Y KL059C shares

partners with many proteins involved in transcription. Therefore, it is most likely also involved

in transcription. Moreover, from the low probabilities of associations with CFT2 and CFT1, we

strongly suspect that that YKL059C is involved in pre-mRNA 3’ end processing. This is further

conﬁrmed by the clustering method that we present below. Our website provides an interactive

tool for users to search for the close associates of any query protein and thus derive its putative

function [21].

Since functionally related proteins form strong associations with each other, this can be used

as the basis for an algorithm to cluster them into functional modules. We derive 202 modules

[Fig. 2] from the associations and then compare the annotations of constituent proteins. 163 of the

derived modules have all proteins annotated in the SGD database [11] and we ﬁnd 149 of them

(about 92%) to have all members of the module from the same functional complex or pathway.

Therefore, if an unannotated protein belongs to the same modules with other proteins of known

functions, we can predict its functions to be the same as the other ones with high conﬁdence. By

analyzing the derived modules, we predict functions for 81 unannotated proteins and present them

in Table III.

We note that the chosen cut-off value (10−8) is not a sharp threshold. As the number is in-

creased, the amount of biologically meaningful information degrades gradually. In the case of the

modules, their numbers and sizes increase with increasing cut-off. As an example, for the well-

studied mediator complex shown in ﬁgure 2(a), as we increase the cut-off value, more proteins

known to be part of the complex come together. We ﬁnd that even with cut-off as high as 2 × 10−4,

the proteins included in the mediator module are genuinely related to the complex. In our website

we present an interactive program that allows users to choose different cut-off values and obtain

the corresponding modules. Among the additional modules derived with higher threshold, we

ﬁnd two that contain mostly unannotated proteins and therefore are possibly large complexes not

yet well studied by experimentalists. One of them is suspected to be involved in actin cytoskele-

ton organization and protein vacuolar targeting and the other one in splicing, rRNA processing

and snoRNA processing. We present them in Figs. 3 and 4 expecting their identiﬁcation to spur

additional interest among yeast biologists.

The method presented here has several advantages. Firstly, it is not sensitive to random false

positives. To illustrate, we added connections randomly increasing the average number of inter-

actions by 50% and were still able to recover 90% of the top 2833 associations. Secondly, the

method is not biased by the number of partners a protein has. As an example, JSN1, a nuclear

pore protein, has the largest number of interactions in the measured dataset, but none of the 2833

associations derived by our method contains JSN1. Among the drawbacks, our method cannot

extract much information about proteins with none or very few interactions in the dataset.

TABLE II: Categories - T: transcription, U: unannotated protein, C: cellular fate/organization. Most of the

associations of YKL059C are involved in transcription and therefore it is also expected to do the same. From

its very low probabilities [16] of associating with CFT1 and CFT2, it is strongly suspected to be involved in

pre-mRNA 3’ end processing. Our website provides an interactive tool to search for the associates of any

protein [21].

In conclusion, we derived functional modules and reliably predicted functions of unannotated

proteins from the existence of abnormally large number of shared interaction partners in the

protein-protein interaction network. We believe the real power of the method will be in study-

ing the higher eukaryotes, where higher fraction of genes has unknown functions. Moreover, the

method is applicable to other forms of networks, such as the Internet, metabolic networks, social

networks and predator-prey networks.

[18] We used 09/01/2002 update of the DIP dataset containing 14871 interactions for 4692 proteins.
[19] Since the dataset contains N = 4692 proteins, 1/N 2 ∼ 10−8 is a reasonable cutoff. The number is

validated by more rigorous comparison with random network shown in Fig. 1. However, this is not a
sharp threshold as we discuss in more detail in the paper. Therefore, we present pairs up to 2 × 10−4

the actual number of unannotated proteins is lower than this source.

FIG. 5: In the above interaction network, both proteins A and B have 4 partners (n1 and n2). Two of the
partners (marked by dark circles) are shared by both of them. We compute the probability for such an event
to occur in a random network. If the computed probability is low, perhaps two proteins are redundant in
their functions.

APPENDIX A: SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATIONS (THEORY)

1. Methods

a. Mathematical Expression for Probability

In a network of N proteins, the probability that two proteins with n1 and n2 partners [Fig. 5]

share m common partners is given by

P (N, n1, n2, m) =

=

(N − n1)!(N − n2)!n1!n2!
N!m!(n1 − m)!(n2 − m)!(N − n1 − n2 + m)!

n1

m













N − n1
n2 − m





N

n2









The above expression is symmetric with respect to interchange of n1 and n2. Eq. A1 is derived in

the following manner. It is a ratio where the denominator is the total number of ways two proteins

can have n1 and n2 partners given by

(A1)

(A2)

N

n1













N

n2

,





FIG. 6: In our clustering algorithm, we start with a matrix with p-values for all pairs. If the element (m, n)
has the lowest p-value, a cluster is formed with proteins m and n. Therefore, rows/columns m and n are
merged with new p value of the merged row/column as geometric mean of the separate p values of the
corresponding elements.

whereas the numerator is the number of cases among them where m of those partners are common

to both of them. It is expressed as

N

m













N − m
n1 − m









N − n1
n2 − m





= 


N

n1

















n1

m

N − n1
n2 − m

.





(A3)

The numerator can be derived using the following argument. In the combinatorial product on the

left hand side, the ﬁrst term represents the number of ways m common partners can be chosen
from all N proteins. For the ﬁrst protein, we choose n1 − m remaining partners out of remaining
N − m proteins. This is the second term in the product. Subsequently for the second protein, we
choose n2 − m remaining partners none of which match any of n1 partners of the ﬁrst protein.
This contributes to the third term.

For the calculations in our paper, the results are approximately the same, whether we compute

the probabilities for pairs with exactly m common partners or we compute for m or more partners.

It can be checked from the expression of probability in Eq. A1, that probability terms for increasing

m fall inversely with N. Since N for our case is about 5000, the additional terms in the probability

expression are negligible.

probabilities. The list is also available as a supplementary material.

b. Clustering Technique

Our clustering method is as follows. We compute p values for all possible protein pairs and

store them in a matrix. Then we pick the protein pair with lowest p value and choose it as the

ﬁrst group in the cluster. The rows and columns for these two proteins are merged into one row

and one column [Fig. 6]. Probability numbers for this new group are geometric means of the two

probabilities [or arithmetic means of the log(p) values]. The process is continued repeatedly, thus

adding more and more clusters as well as making the existing ones bigger, until a threshold is

reached.

2. Ancient Paralogs

Ref. [24] proposed possibility of duplication of the entire yeast genome in some distant past

and presented a list of genes that were identical or matched closely due to this event. We check

how many of the associations derived by us were also such ancient paralogs and present them in

Table. IV. We ﬁnd 22 such ancient paralogs among the list of top 2833 pairs (.7%). Therefore,

these are the ancient paralogs that maintained their functions over time.

CYR1, MYO4 etc.) make us suspect that these two processes are 
linked with each other. 

Signal-transducer and nucleus-cytoplasm transport. 

CDD1-cytidine deaminase,  ECM31-pantothenate biosynthesis,  
PRO3-proline biosynthesis, therefore, YJL199C (MBB1) is likely to 
be involved in metabolic process.

VAM7 is v-SNARE protein linked with Golgi to vacuole transport. 
Therefore, we strongly suspect that YHR105W (YPT35) is active in 
similar function. It also shares partners with YPT1 and YPT32 
involved in similar functions. Double deletion experiment is 
recommended. 
Regulation of transcription from Pol II promoter.  

PET9 is linked with ATP/ADP exchange. Therefore, we suspect that 
YKR046C (PET10) is active in similar function. 

They form mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit. 

GBP2 is involved in telomeric DNA binding, whereas GBP2 is 
suspected to play a role in transcription elongation by Pol II.  Double 
mutation would clarify their closer link. They are also weakly linked 
with HPR1 (DNA-dependent transcription) and MFT1 (protein-
mitochondrial targeting) proteins. 

MSS116 is a RNA helicase linked with RNA splicing. YLR432W 
(IMD3) is IMP dehydrogenase. However, their strong links with other 
proteins involved with RNA metobolism (such as NOP12) make us to 
suspect that they are both in that pathway. Double mutation of them 
may establish the point.

dehydrogenase. Therefore, it is likely that other two yet unannoted 
proteins are also linked with similar metabolic purposes. Since they 
are all individually viable, multiple deletion experiments may reveal 
their functional link.

Both of them are protein transporters involved in mitochondrial 
translocation. 

Both proteins have been located with mitochondrion. MHR1 is a 
transcription regulator involved in mitochondrial genome 
maintenance, whereas YDR116C is part of mitochondrial large 
ribosomal subunit. 

Both are involved in mRNA-splicing.  

Both unknown. Based on our study, we suspect these and following 
other proteins are involved in processing of 27S pre-rRNA ribosomal 
subunit. They are NOG1, YGR103W, HAS1, CDC95, RLP7, 
YKR081C, YHR052W, YMR049C, YTM1, NOP2, YDR101C,

MDH1 is a malic enzyme linked with tricarboxylic acid cycle. 
Therefore, unannotated IPP1, an inorganic diphosphatase is expected 
to have similar function.

MAP kinase proteins involved in the signal transduction of mating 
signal. 

All the proteins except PAB1 are involved in transport of proteins and 
mRNAs between nucleus and cytoplasm. Only PAB1 is linked with 
regulation of translation initiation. The reason why PAB1 got 
associated here with transport proteins is not clear to us.

YGR278W are suspected to have similar functions. 

They are all part of SNARE complex and involved in transport 
between Golgi and other vesicles as well as non-selective vesicle 
fusions. 

In our analysis, ECM29 shares many pairs with the proteasome 
complex member proteins. It is linked with cell-wall organization and 
biogenesis, whereas GCN1 is linked with regulation of translational 
elongation. Their link is not clear to us. 

All these proteins are parts of proteasome complex linked with 
proteolysis and peptolysis.

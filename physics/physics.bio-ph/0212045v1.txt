Abstract

Helicase opening of double-stranded nucleic acids may be “active” (the helicase directly
destabilizes the dsNA to promote opening) or “passive” (the helicase binds ssNA available due
to a thermal ﬂuctuation which opens part of the dsNA). We describe helicase opening of dsNA,
based on helicases which bind single NA strands and move towards the double-stranded region,
using a discrete “hopping” model. The interaction between the helicase and the junction where
the double strand opens is characterized by an interaction potential. The form of the potential
determines whether the opening is active or passive. We calculate the rate of passive opening
for the helicase PcrA, and show that the rate increases when the opening is active. Finally, we
examine how to choose the interaction potential to optimize the rate of strand separation. One
important result is our ﬁnding that active opening can increase the unwinding rate by 7 fold
compared to passive opening.

Introduction

A helicase is a molecular-motor protein which opens double-stranded nucleic acid (NA) molecules.
The strand separation is fueled by nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) hydrolysis, typically of ATP.
Since the discovery of the ﬁrst helicase in 1976 [1], more than 60 distinct helicase proteins have
been found [2], including 12 apparent helicases solely in the bacterium E. coli. Helicases play
a role in nearly every cellular process which involves NA, including replication, transcription,
translation, repair, and RNA processing [2]. All helicases share the ability to move along NA
strands, and to couple that motion to strand separation. For this reason, helicases are often
referred to as DNA translocases [3]. Certain helicases, because of their role in repair of DNA
damage, are crucial to maintain a stable (undamaged) genome. For example, helicase muta-
tions play a role in the human diseases Xeroderma Pigmentosum, Bloom syndrome and Werner
syndrome, all of which are associated with a predisposition to cancer [4].

Given the ubiquity of helicases in cellular processes which access nucleic acids and the large
number of diﬀerent types of helicase, it is not surprising that a variety of diﬀerent helicase
structures exist. We note that the many diﬀerent examples of helicases are not all similar,
and their unwinding mechanisms are not necessarily the same. The earliest known helicases
were ring-shaped hexamers[2]; other helicases have been shown to function as dimers. In the

1

last 5 years, the helicase superfamilies I and II (SF1 and SF2, based on sequence comparison)
have been discovered; this work led to a revision of the view that helicase function requires a
multimeric protein. For a review of the SF1 and SF2 helicases see [3].

This paper was inspired by experiments on the SF1 and SF2 helicases. The monomeric
proteins are known to bind to single-stranded (ss) NA and translocate directionally along it.
Upon reaching the ss-double strand (ds) junction, the helicase continues and moves the junction
foward, creating additional ssNA “track” as it goes. In this paper, we describe the physical
principles of this process and show how to optimize performance of the enzyme. The coupling
between the helicase translocation and NA opening is loosely classiﬁed in the literature [2]
as “passive” or “active.” Passive unwinding means that the helicase unwinds indirectly, by
binding ssNA available due to a ﬂuctuation which opens part of the dsNA. We also call this
“hard” unwinding for reasons discussed below, and to avoid confusion with other meanings of
passive/active. In active unwinding (which we refer to as “soft” unwinding) the helicase directly
destabilizes the dsNA, presumably by binding to the dsNA and changing the free energy of the
ds state.

Experiments on the SF1 protein PcrA support a soft mechanism. Velankar et al. [5] solved
crystal structures of the enzyme bound to a forked (part ss and part ds) DNA substrate. In one
of these structures, the protein binds the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog ADPNP and represents
the helicase prior to ATP hydrolysis. A second structure contains a sulfur ion and represents
the conformation after ATP hydrolysis. These structures showed that the helicase binds ssDNA
and tracks along the single strand as it moves. However, in one crystal, a portion of the PcrA
also binds to the duplex DNA ahead of the ss-ds junction, causing a distortion of the helical
structure. The authors suggested that this distortion promotes melting of the helix, thereby
facilitating strand separation. The crystal structures and footprinting studies [6] showed that
the contact between the protein and the double helix occurs 4-5 base pairs (bp) from the junction
and again 12-13 bp from the junction. Soultanas et al. mutated the residues of PcrA which
interact with the duplex portion of the DNA [6]. The mutant proteins unwound dsDNA 10-30
fold more slowly than the wild-type protein, depending on which residue is mutated. These
experiments provide evidence that PcrA unwinds softly and suggest that hard unwinding may
be slower and less eﬀective than soft.

In this paper, we use a simple model to explore the theoretical consequences of soft and
hard opening. We suppose that the helicase and the NA ss-ds junction interact. Physically,
the interaction corresponds to an interaction potential which describes how the presence of the
helicase modiﬁes the free-energy change of the NA opening. In our formulation, passive opening
corresponds to a hard-wall potential: the helicase cannot advance beyond the ss-ds junction,
but the presence of the helicase does not aﬀect the energetics of dsNA opening. Softer potentials
correspond to active opening, because the helicase changes the local energetics at the junction.
We study how NA strand separation depends on the interaction. In particular, we show that
passive opening is always slower than a simple form of active opening. We calculate the rate of
hard opening for the helicase PcrA, and discuss how the rate increases for soft opening. Finally,
we examine how to choose the interaction potential to optimize the rate of strand separation.
One important result is our ﬁnding that soft opening can increase the unwinding rate by 7 fold
compared to hard opening. This result is consistent with the mutation studies of PcrA discussed
above.

Although extensive biochemical and structural studies of helicases have been performed, rel-
atively little has been done to characterize the function of helicases theoretically. An important
review of helicase mechanism by von Hippel and Delagoutte [7] synthesizes the thermodynamic
and kinetic properties of helicases into a general framework and emphasizes the importance
of considering helicase-NA binding, translocation, and strand-separation independently. Doer-
ing et al. [8] developed a “ﬂashing ﬁeld” model speciﬁc to hexameric ring helicases. Recently
Bhattacharjee and Seno [9] considered the coexistence of ss and dsDNA in the presence of a

2

helicase. Chen et al. [10] described a helicase as a biased random walk, and considered how the
density of histones aﬀects the random walk. However, we know of no theoretical work which
addresses how the interaction between helicase and NA aﬀects the unwinding in general, or the
diﬀerence between active and passive unwinding in particular. Helicases oﬀer a particularly
appealing choice for a simpliﬁed physical description because they are an important class of
enzyme which interacts with NA, yet they have many relatively simple features. For example,
many helicases have unwinding rates which are independent of the NA sequence unwound[2, 11].
Thus, the information content of the NA does not play an essential role in helicase operation—a
large simpliﬁcation compared to RNA polymerases, for example[12, 13]. Monomeric helicases
are a relatively simple system that may serve as a building block for future theoretical studies
of helicases. However, the principles discussed here are quite general and could also apply to
multimeric helicases.

1.1 Helicase properties

Extensive experiments in the last thirty years have characterized several important properties
of helicases[2]. A helicase may bind a ss tail of NA adjoining a duplex, a forked NA containing
both a ds region and two ss arms, or the blunt end of dsNA. Most helicases bind and translocate
with polarity: they move—either on a single strand, or on one of the two strands of a duplex—in
a preferred direction. A 3’-5’ helicase moves toward the 5’ end of the NA strand to which it is
bound. The monomeric SF1 helicases we consider here bind to a ssNA tail. Thus after binding,
the helicase moves along the ss tail to the ss-ds junction, then continue moving to unwind.

Once a helicase has bound to a strand and begins moving, it unwinds at a measurable average
rate, ranging from a few (for PcrA) to thousands (for RecBCD) of bp/sec. The average number
of base pairs unwound before the helicase falls oﬀ the NA is known as the processivity; measured
values for diﬀerent types of helicases vary from 40 to 30,000 bases unwound [2]. Both the rate
and the processivity of a helicase are strongly aﬀected by the presence of accessory proteins as
well as solution conditions. For example, E. coli single-strand binding protein (SSB) decreases
the average free energy cost of unwinding a segment of dsDNA, and has also been observed
to increase the processivity of helicases. High values of processivity, such as the 30,000 bp
measured for RecBCD, are usually observed in the presence of SSB[2]. Hexameric ring helicases
also tend to have higher processivities than dimeric or monomeric helicases. In the absence of
any accessory proteins, the monomeric helicase PcrA translocates on ssDNA at a rate of about
80 bases/s [14] and has a low processivity of about 50 bp unwound [15].

A helicase is able to unwind dsNA because it uses the energy released by nucleotide hydrol-
ysis (usually by ATP) for its motion. The average number of bp unwound per ATP molecule
hydrolyzed is called the eﬃciency of unwinding (this quantity is often called the “eﬃciency” of
the helicase in the literature; we prefer to call it the eﬃciency of unwinding to distinguish it
from the eﬃciency of energy transduction, which is related but not exactly the same). Again,
the presence of SSB changes the free energy balance and increases helicase eﬃciency of unwind-
ing. Under E. coli conditions at room temperature, ATP hydrolysis releases about 23 kT, and
the average free-energy change from melting one base pair is approximately 1.7–2.5 kT [2]. The
theoretical limit on eﬃciency of unwinding is thus 9–12 bp unwound per ATP hydrolysis. Exper-
imentally measured values are typically smaller, usually 0.33–1 bp unwound/ATP hydrolyzed[2].
For PcrA, the measured eﬃciency of unwinding is approximately 1 bp unwound/ATP [11].

2 Hopping Model

We formulate a discrete model for helicase motion and strand separation (Fig. 1). We consider
two degrees of freedom: the helicase position n along the NA strand and the position m of the

Figure 1: Sketch of helicase on NA.

NA ss-ds junction. Since we are considering only single-base hops, both n and m are integers.
(In our units the length of a ss base is 1.) The helicase hops one base forwards towards the
dsNA with rate k+, and backwards with rate k−. Since the helicase hydrolyzes ATP, it is out
of equilibrium1 and has k+ > k−. Similarly, the NA opens by one base2 with rate α and closes
with rate β. Because the NA tends to close (in the absence of melting agents [7]) we have β > α.
Thus the motion of the helicase and the junction tend to drive their positions closer together.
Our simple picture neglects several eﬀects. We ignore binding and unbinding of the helicase,
and thus consider the motion of the helicase along the NA strand only. The NA strand we treat
as a rigid, one-dimensional track (twist relaxation is fast compared to the unwinding rate). We
neglect eﬀects of the NA sequence; each NA base is identical. We ignore the diﬀerent biochemical
states of the helicase and describe it only by forward and backward rates.

For a helicase to unwind a NA duplex, it must interact with (and move) the ss-ds junction.
The form of this interaction determines whether the unwinding is soft or hard. We describe
this interaction by an potential U (m − n) between the helicase and the NA ss-ds junction which
depends only on the diﬀerence between m and n. For large separations m − n ≫ 1 we assume
that the junction and the helicase have no eﬀect on each other, so the coupling potential tends to
zero. However, when m − n is small the coupling potential U changes both the helicase motion
and the junction motion: U > 0 inhibits the forward motion of the helicase and increases the
relative opening rate of the junction.

We use detailed balance (the law of mass action) to write how this coupling potential changes
the rates. If the NA closes (so m → m − 1), the change in interaction energy is U (m − n) −
U (m − n − 1). The opening and closing of the NA happens without an external energy source,
so detailed balance applies. The ratio of the opening and closing rates is

where α and β are the sequence-averaged rates when the helicase and ss-ds junction are far
apart. (See Section 4 for a discussion of the values of the diﬀerent rates.)

We now apply the same argument to the helicase motion. The change in energy U (m −
n − 1) − U (m − n) represents the eﬀective force acting on the helicase. We describe the force

1The rates k+, and k− can be derived from a more complicated model which explicitly treats the nonequilibrium

nature of the enzyme. A forthcoming article will address this issue.

2We consider only the breathing modes of the NA in which it opens or closes by one base pair. Modes in which

larger number of bases open are present, but they are much less probable than the single-base opening or closing.

Eq. (2) is not valid in general, because the helicase is driven by ATP hydrolysis and detailed
balance cannot be used. However, it holds for certain cases in a model for motion generation
by ATP hydrolysis3 and is very useful for a discussion of the principles.

The essence of passive opening is to suppose that the helicase provides a steric inhibition of
NA closing when it is near the junction. If the junction is at position m = n+1, then the helicase
covers the ss base adjacent to the junction and prevents base-pairing with the complementary
NA strand. Thus hard opening requires βm to equal 0 when m = n + 1. By equation (1), we
see that βm = 0 if U (0) is inﬁnite. This is the hard-wall potential sketched in Fig. 2a.

The eﬀect of this potential on the helicase motion makes intuitive sense, as seen in Eq. (2).
If U (0) is inﬁnite then k+
n = 0 when m = n+ 1. In other words, the helicase is unable to advance
into the double-stranded NA region and must wait until a thermal ﬂuctuation opens the NA
before advancing. This example shows how we describe hard opening: when the helicase and
dsNA cannot overlap, the interaction energy U is inﬁnite for n ≥ m.

The interaction potential U (m−n) can be “softer” than the hard wall form. Such a potential
(as in Fig. 2b) leads to active opening, because the interaction with the helicase increases the
opening rate of the dsNA. Recall Eq. (1) for the position dependence of the rates. Whenever the
NA closing increases the interaction energy (U (m − n − 1) > U (m − n)), the ratio of NA closing
to opening rate decreases, relative to β/α. Thus the interaction with the helicase can increase
the rate of opening or decrease the rate of closing (or both). The crystal structure of PcrA
discussed above, which shows that the enzyme can bind to the dsDNA and distort it suggests
active opening. In addition, point mutations of the region of PcrA which binds the duplex DNA
decrease the unwinding rate [6]. In our picture, the mutations could alter the potential so it
approaches a hard-wall form (which corresponds to hard opening).

For a real helicase such as PcrA we do not know the exact form of the potential. We explore
diﬀerent forms of U (m − n) subject to the requirements (i) U → 0 for m ≫ n (when the
helicase and the junction are far apart, there is no interaction) and (ii) U → ∞ for n ≫ m.
The second requirement means that the helicase cannot bind solely to dsNA and always retains

some “footing” on the ssNA. An increase in the energy for n > m is necessary to conﬁne the
helicase near the ss-ds junction and prevent it from wandering oﬀ into the ds region.

In the analysis of this model, we address several questions. How does changing the potential
aﬀect the unwinding rate? We showed above that an increasing interaction potential has two
eﬀects: it leads to relatively faster NA opening and relatively slower helicase forward motion.
We wish to understand how this trade-oﬀ can be resolved. In particular, is there a choice of
interaction potential which leads to the fastest possible rate of opening? We address these
questions below for certain simpliﬁed forms of the potential U .

2.1 Solving for the opening rates
We wish to determine the rate of dsNA unwinding for the hopping model, given the rates k+, k−,
α, β, and the potential U (m − n). We consider the probability P (n, m, t) that the helicase is at
base n and the ss-ds junction at base m at time t. We give the details of this calculation in App.
A and outline the main features here. Our approach is similar to the polymerization ratchet
of Peskin, Odell, and Oster, who examined how a polymerizing ﬁlament is able to produce a
force [16]. In their work, the two ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom are the tip of a ﬁlament and
a wall, which are analogous to our helicase and ss-ds junction. However, they considered a
hard-wall interaction; thus our work may be considered a generalization of their approach. The
probability distribution satisﬁes the Eq. (17), which describes the changes to P (n, m, t) due to
opening/closing of the NA (which changes m) and helicase hopping (which changes n).

(18)). This allows an important simpliﬁcation since the coeﬃcients in Eq.

We rewrite this equation using diﬀerence and midpoint variables j = m − n and l = m + n
(Eq.
(18) are
independent of l. By summing Eq. (18) over l, we obtain Eq. (19) for the diﬀerence-variable
distribution Pj =
l P (j, l). This equation describes the relaxation of the diﬀerence-variable
distribution to a stationary one, which corresponds to a constant current in the diﬀerence
variable j. The potential diverges as j → −∞, which implies that the helicase cannot pass the
junction. Therefore, the j-current must vanish, which leads to a simple recursion relation for
Pj that depends on the interaction potential.

P

The strand separation velocity can be calculated assuming that the distribution Pj is sta-
tionary. The distribution Pj reaches its steady state after a relaxation time related to the rates
α, β, k+, and k−. Summing Eq. (18) over j leads to a discrete drift-diﬀusion equation for
Πl =
j P (j, l) (Eq. (24)). The corresponding current in l does not vanish and determines the
mean strand separation velocity

The expression for v has a simple physical interpretation. The quantity in parentheses is the

move the helicase/junction complex forward. Similarly, a backward hope of the helicase (k

NA closing (βj) move the complex backwards. We then take the unwinding velocity at separation
j and multiply it by the probability Pj of ﬁnding the complex at separation j. Repeating this
addition for all possible j, we arrive at the total unwinding rate. Thus we see that, under
our assumptions, solving Eq. (21) for the stationary probability distribution Pj is suﬃent to
calculate the mean helicase opening velocity. The diﬀusive part of the equation for Πl allows us
to determine the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient which characterizes velocity ﬂuctuations

3 Hard versus soft opening

Consider the hard wall model for passive opening, with the wall at j = 0. As described above,
this means k+, k−, α and β are constant in the region j > 0 except at j = 1, where k+
1 = β1 = 0.
Since the rates are constant, we have

Pj = A

(β + k− − α − k−)/(α + k+). Evaluating Eq.(3) for the helicase opening velocity, we ﬁnd

β+k+ and the constant A is determined from normalization: A =

−

The opening velocity is positive whenever k+/k− > β/α, that is, the free energy change which
drives DNA closing must be smaller than the eﬀective free energy change of the helicase. This
requirement intuitively makes sense: the helicase must have a suﬃciently high forward rate to
overcome the energetically favorable DNA closing. The sequence-averaged value of β/α for DNA
is 7 (corresponding to an average free energy change per base closed of 2 kT). Thus, even by
this simple calculation we see that for passive opening to be possible we must have k+ > 7k−.
The backward rate k− must be considerably smaller than the forward rate, as observed in
experiments[11, 14].

3.1 Soft opening: the staircase

Next we consider a simple example of soft opening shown in Fig. 2b. Instead of a hard-wall
potential, we insert a step of height Uo at j = 0 and a hard wall at j = −1. Thus the DNA
junction and the helicase can overlap by one base if the energetic cost is paid. The ratios of the
forward and backward rates at the step must satisfy the relations

These relations aﬀect only the ratios of the rates. We also have to specify how the rates
themselves change. This is determined by the position of the barrier which must be crossed
for the helicase to move or for the NA to open/close. We describe this by a weighting factor
0 < f < 1. (Note that f is the same for the helicase motion and the NA breathing since both
phenomena involve the same barrier.) Smaller values of f imply that the barrier inﬂuences
mainly backward rates, while for large f the barrier aﬀects forward rates. We have

With these values, we can calculate the opening velocity v1 for one step. For comparison, we

where c = α+k
β+k+ . Since 0 < f < 1, the opening velocity v1 for a single step is always larger
than vHW . However, the size of v/vHW depends strongly on the choice of f (Fig. 3a). Smaller
values of f increase the opening velocity. The maximal opening rate occurs when f = 0. From
Eq.(14), we see that for f = 0 and large Uo, v1 → vHW /c ≈ 7vHW . For small values of f
the helicase forward rate k+ and the DNA closing rate β do not change much due to the step,
whereas the helicase backward rate k− and the DNA opening rate α increase signiﬁcantly. The
main advantage of active opening is that it increases the opening rate of the DNA. It is more
advantageous to increase the opening rate than to decrease the closing rate, because with an
increased opening rate the strand-separation timescale is faster.

The unwinding rate also depends on the step height Uo. For small Uo, the velocity is little
changed from the hard-wall velocity. As the step height increases, so does the opening velocity,
as a result of the increase in DNA opening rate caused by the presence of the step. For a height
of 1 kT and f = 0.05, the opening velocity is approximately twice the hard-wall velocity. We
draw particular attention to the barrier height of 2 kT. This means that the helicase at j = 0
causes the base-pair nearest the junction to be indiﬀerent to opening. A 2 kT step height with
f = 0.05 increases the opening velocity by approximately a factor of 3 relative to the hard-
wall velocity. For a further comparison of our calculation to experimental data, please see the
Discussion below.

3.2 Multi-step staircase

Evidence from the crystal structures of PcrA bound to a forked DNA substrate discussed above
suggests that we consider more than one “step” in the potential. The structures indicate that
the helicase and dsDNA interact 4-5 bp from the junction, and again 12-13 bp from the junction.
Thus we should consider an interaction potential with a variable number of steps. For a multi-
step staircase (with n identical steps, each of height Uo, see Fig. 2c) the unwinding velocity
is

particular, note that for n = 1 the expression here reduces to Eq. (14). Fig. 3b shows how the
velocity changes with step number (for f = 0.1). Adding additional steps allows the opening
velocity to increase faster, and the maximum opening speed increases with the number of steps.
We note that as the number of steps becomes large, the step size Uo corresponding the the
maximum opening velocity approaches Umax ≈ − ln c. In other words, in the limit of a large
number of steps, the optimal step height approaches the free energy change of melting one base
of NA: the fastest opening occurs when the interaction between helicase and NA causes the
melting of one NA base pair to be energetically neutral.

For a step height of 2 kT, adding one step increase the opening velocity by a factor of 3.5,
whereas for 5 steps of height 2 kT the opening velocity is 5 times the hard-wall velocity. This
is a signiﬁcant increase over the hard-wall velocity. The PcrA mutation studies [6] found that
mutating the residues which interact with the dsDNA decreased the unwinding rate by a factor
of 10-30. While our model shows a decrease in the opening velocity (when opening changes from
soft to hard) of at most a factor of 1/c ≈ 7, we ﬁnd it striking that such a simple model can
demonstrate such a large change in the velocity. We emphasize that because our result looks at
the ratio of active to passive unwinding rates, it is independent of particular helicase properties
such as k+ and k−. Our result depends only on the sequence-averaged ratio of DNA opening
and closing rates c as well as the number of steps n and the step size Uo.

Indeed, while hard opening is signiﬁcantly slower than the PcrA single-strand translocation
rate, the helicase that chooses (or evolves) an appropriate interaction potential can open NA
nearly as fast as the rate it moves on ssNA.

4 Discussion

In this paper, we have described the opening of NA by a helicase in terms of two hopping degrees
of freedom: the position of the helicase, which hops along ssNA driven by ATP hydrolysis, and
the position of the ss-ds NA junction, which ﬂuctuates passively. This simpliﬁed model allows us
to focus on how the motion is aﬀected by the interaction between these two degrees of freedom.
We demonstrate that active opening in general leads to a faster overall unwinding rate that can
approach the velocity of motion of helicase along the ssNA.

We show that the interaction between helicase and dsNA determines the speed of unwinding.
If rapid unwinding is advantageous, helicases will evolve towards interaction potentials which
optimize this speed. In our calculations we can make quantitative predictions of how diﬀerent
potentials change the unwinding rate.

Because the helicase moves primarily forward, the backward rate k− is small compared to k+.
Dillingham, Wigley, and Webb used two diﬀerent techniques[11, 14] to measure the rate of PcrA
motion on ssDNA. In our notation, this is k+ − k− = 80 bases/sec. They found that their data
were well-ﬁt by a model with no backward steps (k− = 0), although our analysis of their results
found a comparably good ﬁt with values of k− up to 10% of k+. The free-energy change ∆F of
opening one base determines the ratio α/β = e−∆F/kT . This ratio is approximately ∆F ≃ 2kT
for a base-pair near a junction[17]. This value is consistent with bulk melting-curve results [2]
and is the origin of our number α/β = e−2 ≈ 1/7. For the actual values of α and β, we deduce
a number using the experimental results of Bonnet, Krichevsky, and Libchaber [18] who found
that the opening rate of a 5-bp hairpin loop at 300 K and at 0.1 M NaCl was k ≃ 3000/sec.

9

Using a simple kinetic model4 we estimate from this value of k that α ≈ 1.4 × 106/sec. We
use this value of α in our calculations below. This estimate can be compared with theoretical
estimates of the base-pair opening rate α, which range from 105/sec to 106/sec [19, 20].

Here we compare the results of our model to experimental data, using the experimental
values of k+, k−, α, and β discussed above The maximum possible hard-wall opening velocity
occurs in the case where k− = 0. Then

vHW =

α
β (cid:18)

k+
1 + k+/β (cid:19)

≈ 11 bases/sec.

(16)

Note that this is an upper bound on the velocity: any non-zero value of k− decreases the
hard-wall velocity. Unfortunately, to our knowledge the unwinding rate has not been directly
measured for SF1 helicases such as PcrA. Existing unwinding assays [6] use gel electrophoresis to
determine the fraction of dsDNA molecules completely unwound at a given time. Therefore we
cannot make a direct comparison between our calculation and measured unwinding velocities.
Adding a single-step-staircase potential allows the velocity to increase by up to a factor of
7. We choose a modest step height of 2 kT, which gives a maximum increase over the hard-wall
velocity of a factor of 3 (for f = 0.1). Thus the DNA opening velocity could be up to 33
bases/sec for a single-step-staircase potential. For a multi-step staircase, 5 steps of height 2
kT increase the opening rate by a factor of 5. Thus the helicase unwinding rate can increase
to 55 bases/sec from the hard rate of 11 bases/sec. This velocity is nearly as large as the
single-strand translocation speed itself. Thus we demonstrate that soft opening—despite the
extemely simpliﬁed form of the interaction potential we have chosen—can signiﬁcantly increase
the strand-separation rate.

We emphasize that changes to the helicase hopping rates k+ and k−, for example due to
changes in the ATP concentration, lead to changes in the unwinding rate which our model
predicts quantitatively. Similarly, the free energy change of melting one NA base pair can by
changed by altering solution conditions or by applying a force to the NA molecule. Such a
change directly alters the parameter c ≈ α/β in our model, and we quantitatively predict the
resulting change in the unwinding rate. Here, we have neglected the eﬀects of the base sequence
on NA opening which are believed to be weak for helicases[2]. However, work by Lubensky and
Nelson [21] suggest that interesting eﬀects can arise if a random DNA sequence is opened.

The simpliﬁed structure of this model means it may be useful in other situations where two
degrees of freedom interact. For example, two motor proteins which walk on a microtubule may
aﬀect each other’s motion. As mentioned above, our work may be viewed as a generalization of
the work of Peskin et al. [16] to include an arbitrary type of interaction potential. This gener-
alization may also be relevant to the problem originally addressed in Ref. [16]: the production
of a force by a polymerizing ﬁlament. Introducing a potential (which describes the interaction
between the growing ﬁlament tip and the obstacle against which the polymer pushes) aﬀects
the polymerization speed and the force-velocity relation of the ﬁlament.

4We assume that each of the 5 bases has an opening rate α and a closing rate β and the ratio α/β = c. With
Pn denoting the relative probability of having n base pairs open, the opening rate is given by k = J/
Pn =
αc3/(1 + 2c + 3c2 + 4c3 + c4(1 + c + c2 + c3 + c4)), where J = αP0 − βP1 = αP4 is the current. With this expression
we estimate α, given k and c.

A Calculation of the Unwinding Velocity

Here we determine the rate of dsNA opening for the hopping model, given the rates k+, k−, α,
β, and the coupling potential U (m − n). Consider the probability P (n, m, t) that the helicase
is at position n and the ss-ds junction at position m at time t. The probability satisﬁes

The stationary probability distribution corresponds to a constant current solution. In the case

The diﬀerence variable distribution relaxes to a steady state in a ﬁnite time while the mid-
point variable l undergoes a drift with diﬀusion. We can ﬁnd a simple equation for the midpoint
motion if we focus on times longer than the relaxation time of Pj.
(Since the DNA open-
ing/closing times are of order of microseconds, we expect the relaxation time to be at most
hundreds of microseconds. This time is short compared to the overall rate of unwinding). In
this limit, the probability P (j, l) becomes of the form P (j, l) = PjΠl. If we deﬁne

then the equation for Πl reduces to a hopping model with eﬀective forward and backward rates
p and q:

= −(p + q)Πl + p Πl−1 + q Πl+1.

(24)

The rates p and q are independent of l, because of our assumption that all rates depend only
on the diﬀerence variable j. As above, deﬁning the current Υ(l) = pΠl − qΠl the equation for
the stationary distribution Π becomes Υ(l) = Υ(l − 1). For the midpoint motion, there is no
conﬁning potential which localizes the probability distribution. Thus we expect a solution with
non-zero current. The solution is Πo = 1
N and Υ = (p − q)Πo, where N is the total number of
NA bases. The mean opening velocity of a single helicase is

As discussed in the text, v is the unwinding rate at separation j multiplied by the probability
Pj of ﬁnding the complex at separation j. Repeating this addition for all possible j, we arrive at
the total unwinding rate. The factor of 1/2 appears because we use l = m + n for convenience,
while the true midpoint location is l/2. Thus we see that, under our assumptions, solving Eq. 21
for the stationary probability distribution Pj immediately gives the exact mean helicase opening
velocity.

We can also determine the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient which characterizes velocity ﬂuctu-

Monitoring of the Membrane Potential in
Proteoliposomes with Incorporated
Cytochrome-c Oxidase Using the Fluorescent Dye
Indocyanine

Abstract

A method has been developed to monitor changes of the mem-
brane potential across vesicle membranes in real time. Using the
potential-sensitive ﬂuorescent dye indocyanine and on the basis
of water/lipid redistribution model, a calculation procedure has
been introduced to estimate the membrane potential in vesicles
with incorporated cytochrome-c oxidase. Physical parameters,
such as vesicle size distribution and density of the lipid bilayer
were estimated and used as calculation parameters. By extrapo-
lation of transient potential change to zero time, the initial rate
of the potential change (dU/dt) has been calculated. It is also
shown, that the initial potential change (dU/dt) may be used to
study the proton/electron stoichiometry of cytochrome-c oxidase
incorporated in the vesicles.

Introduction

Cytochrome-c oxidase is the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain which
catalyzes the four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water and cou-
ples this reaction with the uptake of protons from the mitochondrial matrix
site.
In this way, the free energy of oxygen reduction is stored in form
of a membrane potential [1]. Since the proposal of Wikstr¨om, we know
that cytochrome-c oxidase, in addition to the uptake of protons for water
formation, is also capable of vectorial proton translocation and acts as an
electrogenic proton pump [2]. However, the molecular mechanisms and the
H +/e−-stoichiometry of proton translocation by cytochrome-c oxidase are

still unknown. In earlier studies of the electrogenic activity of cytochrome-c
oxidase, the changes of the proton concentration across the lipid membrane
have been directly measured with a pH-microelectrode or a pH-indicator
dye and related to the protein activity [3, 4, 5, 6]. These measurements,
however, are always accompanied with an uncertainty concerning the buﬀer
capacity of the vesicle interface which should be taken into account when the
real quantity of ejected protons have to be calculated [7, 8]. An alternative
possibility of investigating the proton translocation is the measurement of
the membrane potential developed during the protein action. Methods to
measure the membrane potential generated by cytochrome-c oxidase have
been developed earlier based on indirect detection of the redistribution of
lipophilic cations by ion selective electrodes [9, 10, 11]. Because of slow
response time of the ion-selective electrodes, the experimental setup pre-
sented in these works could be used under steady state conditions, but it
does not allow kinetic measurements of the membrane potential. The above
considerations show that the investigation of electrogenic activity of the
cytochrome-c oxidase and its ability of vectorial proton translocation re-
quires an appropriate method with a fast response time, which could allow
the recording of proton translocation events in real time.

The application of voltage-sensitive ﬂuorescent dyes allows the estima-
tion of the membrane potential of cell organelles and membrane vesicles [12,
13, 14]. The mechanism of ﬂuorescence response of the dye to an electri-
cal potential diﬀerence across the lipid bilayer is still a matter of discus-
sion [15, 16, 17]. Under certain experimental conditions, the ﬂuorescence
alteration could be described by a simple redistribution model [14]. Fast
response times of voltage-dependent ﬂuorescent dyes makes them useful in
investigation of the electrogenic activity of ion pumps reconstituted in vesi-
cles [18, 16].

In this work, I present a method for real-time-monitoring of the mem-
brane potential generated by the cytochrome-c oxidase using the potential
sensitive ﬂuorescent dye indocyanine.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Materials

Asolectin, L-α-phosphatidylcholine (type II from soybean) and cytochrome
c (type VI from horse hart) were obtained from Sigma. Before use asolectin
was puriﬁed by the method of Kagawa and Racker [19]. Valinomycin was
from Boehringer, Mannheim. Indocyanine 1 (NK 529) was purchased from
Nippon Kankoh Shikiso Kenkyusho, Okayama, Japan. The dialysis tube
(pore-radius 2.4 nm) was purchased from Serva, Heidelberg. Fluorescence

1Indocianine: 1,3,3,1’,3’,3’-hexamethyl-2,2’-indodicarbocyanine iodide

2

experiments were carried out on a Perkin-Elmer 650-40 ﬂuorescence spec-
trophotometer.

2.2 Buﬀers

If not otherwise indicated, the buﬀer A contained (in mM): 10 K-Hepes, pH
7.4, 1.7 NaCl and 200 KCl. Buﬀer B contained 10 K-Hepes, pH 7.4, 200
NaCl and 1.7 KCl. Buﬀer C contained 10 K-Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 NaCl and
140 KCl.

2.3 Isolation of Cytochrome-c Oxidase

Bovine heart cytochrome-c oxidase was prepared from isolated mitochondria
as described in [20].

2.4 Determination of the cytochrome aa3 content

The cytochrome aa3 content was calculated according to [21]. The extinction
605−630nm = 24.0 mM−1
coeﬃcients for cytochrome aa3 used were ∆Ared−ox
443−490nm = 204.0 mM−1
603−650nm = 40.0 mM−1 cm−1, ∆Ared
cm−1, ∆Aox
421−490nm = 140.0 mM−1 cm−1.
cm−1, ∆Aox

2.5 Measurement of Oxygen Consumption

Oxygen consumption was measured polarographically by using a Clark-type
oxygen electrode attached to a thermostatically controlled cell [22]. 10 - 20 µl
vesicles with reconstituted cytochrome-c oxidase were introduced in 1.5 ml
of buﬀer A with 25 mM potassium ascorbate and various concentrations of
cytochrome c (1 - 50 µM). For measurements of the enzyme activity 0.05%
laurylmaltosid and 0.1 mM EDTA were added additionally. If not otherwise
indicated, the experiments were carried out at 200 C.

2.6 Vesicle Preparation

The enzyme was reconstituted into vesicles by the following procedure: pu-
riﬁed asolectin (30 mg/ml) and 1.5% (w/w) Na-cholate was sonicated to
clarity in buﬀer C. Cytochrome-c oxidase was added to the solubilized lipid
to give a lipid to protein ratio of 50/1 (w/w). After brief mixing, the com-
bined solution was transferred to 6 mm dialysis tubing and dialysed for 48 h
at 40C against 500-fold excess volume of buﬀer C. During the dialysis, buﬀer
C was replaced twice. To calibrate the membrane potential in control ex-
periments, part of the vesicles was prepared in buﬀer A and then dialysed
additionally for 24 h against buﬀer B to reach equal osmotic conditions but

3

diﬀerent inside/outside concentrations of K+. Protein-free vesicles were pre-
pared from puriﬁed asolectin by the same procedure without the addition
of protein.

2.7 Determination of the Lipid Content

The lipid concentration in the suspension was estimated by determination
of choline containing lipids using the phospholipid B test [23]. The amount
of choline containing lipids was related to that of all lipids in asolectine
composition. The concentration of choline containing lipids in the asolectin
estimated in our laboratory (30%) was in a good agreement with published
data [19].

2.8 Electron Microscopy of the Vesicles

The electron microscopic imaging of the vesicles was performed using the
method of negative staining with ammonium molybdate (NH4)6Mo7O24 [24].

2.9 Fluorescence Measurements

Fluorescence experiments were carried out in a thermostatically controlled
cuvette holder which was equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The excitation
wavelength was set to 620 nm (slit width 20 nm) and the emission wavelength
to 660 nm (slit width 5 nm). The indocyanine stock solution contained 5.76
mM dye in ethanol. From this solution dilutions were prepared daily by
mixing with ethanol. Concentrations were chosen such that addition of 1 µl
dye solution to the cuvette resulted in the desired ﬁnal concentration (1 -
3 µM). All ﬂuorescence data were normalised with respect to a ﬂuorescence
standard.

The cuvette was ﬁlled with 1 ml buﬀer and equilibrated in the cuvette
holder to the desired temperature, then 1 µl of an indocyanine solution was
added. After the ﬂuorescence signal was constant, an aliquot of the vesicle
suspension was added. Fluorescence changes, ∆F , caused by additions of
reagents were determined as relative signal changes with respect to ﬂuo-
rescence level, F , prior to the addition; they were corrected for the small
dilution eﬀect which was determined separately by adding a known amount
of buﬀer solution. Independent experiments (data not shown) revealed that
addition of 1 - 3 µl of ethanol had no eﬀect on the ﬂuorescence. At the
beginning and at the end of each experiment the temperature in the cuvette
was controlled. All experiments were carried out at 200C.

3 Results

3.1 Physical Parameters of the Vesicles

The negative staining electron microscopy of the prepared vesicles revealed
a rather narrow size distribution of mainly spherical vesicles. On the images
of the vesicles an insigniﬁcant amount of nonspherical particles could be seen
which were attributed to nonvesicular aggregates (micrographs not shown).
The size distribution of the vesicle population was analyzed by measuring
the diameter of each vesicle followed by ﬁtting of the data to the normal
Gaussian distribution. For the statistical analysis about 1500 vesicle diam-
eters were determined. By this method the nonvesicular fragments could be
excluded from the analysis. Fig. 1a and b represents the probability function
of the vesicle diameters in the range of 20 – 200 nm.

The size distribution of vesicles without cytochrome-c oxidase, Fig.1a,
was in a good agreement with Gaussian distribution, and the determined
average diameter was 44 ± 12 nm. The size distribution of vesicles with
incorporated cytochrome-c oxidase (Fig.1b) clearly shows two vesicle popu-
lations, one of 29 ± 6 nm and the other of 52 ± 14 nm average diameter.
The formation of two vesicle populations after protein reconstitution could
be explained if we assume that not all vesicles in the population contain
protein. This assumption has been supported experimentally by use of ion-
exchange chromatography. The diﬀerence in diameter of protein-free and

5

protein-containing populations could have resulted from the enlargement of
the vesicles due to protein incorporation [25]. The formation of protein-free
vesicles with an average diameter smaller than 44 nm is diﬃcult to explain
so far. One explanation could be that introducing the third component —
protein to the lipid-detergent mixture could also inﬂuence the formation and
size of protein-free vesicles.This subdivision of two vesicle populations could
be analyzed statistically if we assume that the number of incorporated pro-
teins is controlled by Poisson statistics. If we further assume that during the
procedure of vesicle preparation most of the protein is incorporated into the
vesicles, the protein–to–lipid ratio used in this work (see vesicle preparation)
predicts an average monomeric enzyme complex per vesicle of 1.9–2.2. Ac-
cording to the Poisson distribution of the enzyme, 40% of the vesicles should
be protein free. This estimate is in a good agreement with the distribution
represented in Fig.1b. In our calculations we used the molecular weight of
the monomeric complex of cytochrome-c oxidase of 204000 Daltons [26]. It
is still not clear, however, whether the monomer or dimer is the functional
unit of the reconstituted cytochrome-c oxidase.

To study the distribution of indocyanine between the water- and lipid
phases, we need to know the volume of asolectine in the vesicle probe. This
could be calculated if we know the density of the asolectine used. The
size of the vesicle and the number of lipid molecules assembled in a vesicle
give us the information about the average molecular weight and density of
the asolectine. These calculations are based on data published earlier [27].
From these data we assume that the radius of the head group is 4.85 ˚A in
the outer and 4.41 ˚A in the inner monolayer. Therefore, the area occupied
by a lipid molecule in both monolayers can be calculated to be 74 ˚A2 and
61 ˚A2, respectively. Protein-containing vesicles have an external diameter of
52 ± 14 nm (see above). If the lipid bilayer is assumed to be packed with the
highest possible density of lipid head groups, a vesicle contains 8.273 · 104
lipid molecules with a deviation between 4.292 · 104 and 1.355 · 105 molecules
due to the standard deviation of the vesicle diameter.

To calculate the average molecular weight and density of the asolectin
we have measured the entrapped volume for a known quantity of lipid. Vesi-
cles were prepared as described above with known concentration of K2CrO4,
separated on a Sephadex G25 column and the lipid concentration was es-
timated. The whole entrapped volume was determined spectroscopically,
assuming that the K2CrO4 concentration inside the vesicles remains con-
stant. The average molecular weight of asolectin estimated in such a way
were 880 g/mol and 1028 mg/ml respectively.

3.2 Spectral Properties of Indocyanine

sorption maximum at 635.7 nm. The additional shoulders between 570–600

Wave length, nm

nm (absorption spectra) and 690–720 nm (ﬂuorescence spectra) indicate the
presence of higher aggregates of the dye in aqueous solution, as has been
suggested by [15]. The ﬂuorescence maximum of cyanine dyes shifts further
to the red when one transfers the dye from water into nonpolar solvents.
Consistent with this ﬁnding, the ﬂuorescence maximum of indocyanine is
shifted from 658 nm to 676 nm. This is shown in Fig. 2, which represents
the ﬂuorescence spectra of indocyanine as a function of the concentration
of protein-free vesicles. Not only a red shift of the ﬂuorescence spectra, but
also a quenching eﬀect could be seen during the vesicles addition, which is
well-deﬁned in the lipid concentration range between 0 and 60 µg/ml.

A ﬂuorescence change similar to that seen after vesicle addition could
be observed when a membrane potential (inside negative) across the lipid
bilayer of the vesicle was generated. The exact mechanism which is involved
in the ﬂuorescence change during the polarization of the vesicle membrane
It has become evident, however, that the behavior of
is still unknown.
many potential sensitive ﬂuorescent dyes can be described by a distribu-
tion model [15, 13, 14, 28]. Normally the lipophilic cation indocyanine is
distributed between the water and lipid phases according to its partition
coeﬃcient. Polarisation of the lipid membrane by the generated membrane
potential leads to redistribution of the dye molecules between the water
and lipid phases because of electrostatic attraction between the positively
charged indocyanine and negatively charged vesicle interior.

As can be seen from Fig. 2, there were two ﬂuorescence eﬀects which
appeared during the vesicle addition. First, there was a general red shift of
the spectra of indocyanine (658 nm → 676 nm), and second, there was a
pronounced quenching eﬀect at the lipid concentrations 0–60 µg/ml (addi-
tions 2–4, Fig. 2). If we consider the distribution model, with an increasing
vesicle concentration the amount of membrane-bond dye molecules also in-
creases, and consequently the concentration of the dye molecules in water

5-15

decreases. This would lead to a pure shift-eﬀect of the indocyanine spectra
with a constant quantum yield. The position of the peak maximum would
then reﬂect the dye-bound/dye-free ratio. In fact, we observe not only the
red shift of the peak maximum, but additionally there is a strong quenching
eﬀect which makes the analysis of the dye distribution more complex.
It
seems that the most appropriate description of the dye-vesicle interaction is
a mechanism of dye binding to a vesicle with a discrete number of binding
sites [29, 30] If we assume that the initial concentration of dye in the water
phase is suﬃcient for the saturating occupation of binding sites at small
vesicle concentration and, because of that, the quenching of the ﬂuorescence
of the bound dye molecules occurs due to their aggregation, the ﬂuores-
cence change in this case would be determined mainly by the change of the
dye concentration in water. This is what we observe in Fig. 2. After the
vesicle addition (2-4) the ﬂuorescence intensity decreased and the position
of the peak (658nm) remained nearly unchanged. If after the addition of
small amounts of vesicles to the appropriate concentration of dye not all of
the binding sites are occupied, it would still be possible to apply the distri-
bution model to describe the partition of the dye between water and lipid
vesicles. The partition coeﬃcient will then express the aﬃnity of binding
dye molecules to the vesicles [28].

In Fig. 3 the ﬂuorescence change of indocyanine is shown as a function
of the lipid concentration at various ﬁxed wavelengths. The wavelength at
which linearity combines with a large ﬂuorescence change in response to
the change in vesicle concentration (dF/dC lipid) would be the appropriate
ﬁxed wavelength to monitor the dye-vesicle interaction.
In the following
experiments a ﬁxed wavelength of 660 nm was chosen because, in the range
of lipid concentrations 5 - 30 µg/ml, the negative ﬂuorescence change shows
approximate linearity and the magnitude of dF/dC lipid is comparatively
high.

In the absence of lipid vesicles, the total ﬂuorescence (F0) is determined
only by the amount of dissolved dye molecules. The ﬂuorescence of indo-
cyanine in water is a function of its concentration, ionic strength (and/or
buﬀer composition) and aggregation state of the dye molecules. In Fig. 4
the ﬂuorescence of indocyanine (F0) at 660 nm can be seen as a function of
its aqueous concentration. F0 is referred to the ﬂuorescence intensity mea-
sured with a ﬂuorescence standard and expressed in dimensionless numbers.
To describe this dependence we have used the following equation:

proportional to the magnitude of the inner ﬁlter eﬀect of indocyanine. Be-

3.4 Calibration of the ﬂuorescence signal as a function of

membrane potential

Membrane potentials may be generated by establishing a transmembrane
K+ concentration diﬀerence in the presence of valinomycin. At the begin-
ning of the experiment the vesicle interior contains 200 mM KCl (buﬀer A);
the extravesicular aqueous space contains 1.7 mM KCl (buﬀer B). The ad-
dition of valinomycin to the solution makes the vesicle membrane selectively
permeable for the K+ cations. The intravesicular concentration of K+ is
decreased by the release of K+ ions, which builds up a Nernst potential of
120.4 mV (inside negative), according to:

the absolute temperature and F the Faraday constant.

After the inside-negative membrane potential is generated, further ac-
cumulation of indocyanine in the lipid phase occurs. According to the new
equilibrium state, the partition coeﬃcient changes. The new (apparent)
partition coeﬃcient (γapp) of indocyanine is related to the generated mem-
brane potential and can be used for calculation of the membrane potential
value [14].

The accumulation of the dye in the lipid bilayer leads to a ﬂuorescence
decrease. The potential-induced ﬂuorescence change was expressed by the
relative ﬂuorescence change, Fig. 6:

Estimation of the apparent partition coeﬃcient, γapp, at several known
membrane potentials and its relation to the membrane-potential dependent
ﬂuorescence change, F/F, revealed the functional dependence between mem-
brane potential and the relative ﬂuorescence change. The apparent partition
coeﬃcient could be deﬁned analogously to the partition coeﬃcient at zero

ln (Fm − Fapp) − ln (Fm − F0)
ln Fm − ln (Fm − Fapp)
where Fapp is the ﬂuorescence intensity at a predeﬁned voltage value. The
calibration of γapp was carried out as shown in Fig. 6. Addition of indocya-
nine to a ﬁnal concentration of 2,88 µM resulted in the initial ﬂuorescence
level (F0). After that, the vesicle suspension (usually 1 - 3 µl) was added.
The ﬂuorescence decreased due to the dye distribution at zero voltage (in the
absence of valinomycin) and reached the (F ) level. Because of diﬀerent K+
concentrations in the intra- and extravesicular medium, upon the addition
of valinomycin a membrane potential was generated according to the Nernst
equation (9). When the K+ concentration gradient was diminished by addi-
tion of small volumes (1 - 5 µl) of 3 M KCl solution, the membrane potential
decreased and the ﬂuorescence intensity increased. In this way the relative
change of ﬂuorescence intensity (∆F /F ) and the apparent partition coeﬃ-
cient (γapp) were determined for diﬀerent ﬁxed membrane potentials using
equations (10) and (11). The values of partition coeﬃcients were determined
separately for vesicle preparations with and without protein as shown in Fig.
7. The calculated curve was obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data to
the polynomial equation:

(12)

γapp = γ + A1 · U + A2 · U 2

where γ is the partition coeﬃcient at 0 voltage, U is the membrane potential
value, and A1 and A2 are ﬁtting parameters (A1 = 1162.7 mV−1, A2 = 11.29
mV−2). The equations (11) and (12) allowed the calculation of the relative
ﬂuorescence change for any desired voltage and vesicle concentration in the
range of 5 – 30 µg/ml lipid concentration. The relation between relative
ﬂuorescence change (∆F/F ) and appropriate ∆U could be found by the
interpolation of calculated voltage values.

3.5 Membrane potential generated by cytochrome-c oxidase

Cytochrome-c oxidase reconstituted in lipid vesicles formed by cholate dial-
ysis exhibits two orientations. The right-side out orientation (cytochrome-c
binding site oriented outside) however, dominates with 60 - 80% [31]. Ad-
dition of cytochrome-c to the extravesicular medium (in the presence of
K+-ascorbate) resulted in activation of enzyme molecules with right-side
out orientation. Since the cytochrome-c oxidase works as a proton pump
and reduces oxygen to water by the uptake of protons from the vesicle in-
side, activation of right-side out oriented proteins generated an inside neg-
ative membrane potential. The electrogenic eﬀect of cytochrome-c oxidase
is represented in Fig. 8. After addition of 1-2 µl of vesicle suspension the
ﬂuorescence decreased and became stable at a ﬂuorescence level which cor-
responded to the partition coeﬃcient of the indocyanine at 0 mV voltage.

Figure 7: Apparent partition coeﬃcient, γapp, as a function of the membrane potential. Open
circles are protein free vesicles, solid circles are protein containing vesicles. The theoretical curve
was obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data to the polynomial equation (12), where γ is the
partition coeﬃcient at 0 voltage γ = 68.5624 · 103, U is the membrane potential value, A1 and
A2 are the ﬁtting parameters (A1 = 1162.7 mV−1, A2 = 11.29 mV−2).

Addition of K+-ascorbate to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mM did not inﬂuence
the ﬂuorescence. Further addition of cytochrome-c to a ﬁnal concentration
of 10 - 50 µM, resulted in activation of the cytochrome-c oxidase and gener-
ation of a membrane potential which can be calculated from the change of
the relative ﬂuorescence ( ∆F/F ) with time (Fig. 9).

3.6 Inﬂuence of cytochrome-c and K+-ascorbate addition

In Fig. 8 it can be seen that addition of 1 µl of 1 M K+-ascorbate solution
to the vesicle-indocyanine suspension has no inﬂuence on the ﬂuorescence.
A ﬁnal concentration between 10 - 25 mM caused a ﬂuorescence change
(∆F/F ) in the range of only 0.5 - 1%.

Due to its absorbance at 550 nm, addition of cytochrome-c decreased
the intensity of the ﬂuorescence. This eﬀect was measured in experiments
with protein free vesicles. The dependence revealed linearity in the concen-
tration range between 0 and 100 µM cytochrome-c, and corresponds to a
ﬂuorescence change, ∆F/F , of 0.5% per 1 µM cytochrome-c added (data
not shown). This ﬂuorescence change has been taken into account in fur-
ther calculations of the membrane potential by subtraction of this ﬂuores-
cence change from the registered transient data of ∆F/F , produced by the
generated membrane potential. The cytochrome-c eﬀect was estimated by
analogous measurements with the protein-free vesicles.

3.7 Time resolution

One of the restrictions of this experimental set-up is the time resolution
of the initial ﬂuorescence change upon the enzyme activation. The time
necessary to reach homogeneity after addition of a component, or the ”stir-
ring time”, was measured as follows. To the cuvette containing indocyanine
(ﬁnal concentration approx. 2.88 µM) in buﬀer C, 1 - 2 µl of the vesicles
(without protein) were added. After the dye redistribution equilibrium was
reached, various portions (1 - 10 µl) of a 10 mM cytochrome-c solution
were added and the time until the ﬂuorescence reached a constant value was
measured. Since the vesicles were protein free, the solution of cytochrome-c
produced a reduction in ﬂuorescence intensity caused only by absorption at
550 nm. Therefore, the ﬂuorescence equilibration time after the cytochrome-
c addition is the ”stirring time” of our experimental set-up. This stirring
time was estimated to be 400 - 500 ms from an average of 10 measurements.
The redistribution time of the dye molecules between water and lipid phase,
however, is much shorter and lies between 100 µs and 10 ms [32]. For real
time measurements it is short enough to detect the membrane potential
change even after one enzyme turnover.

3.8 Inﬂuence of the pH on the ﬂuorescence of indocyanine

The change of pH value induced by the activity of the cytochrome-c oxidase
may inﬂuence the ﬂuorescence of indocyanine and/or its ability to interact
with the lipid bilayer. To test this suggestion we studied the eﬀect of the
pH change on the ﬂuorescence. The relative ﬂuorescence change (∆F/F )
corresponds to 4.7% per pH unit. Due to an appropriate buﬀering capacity
(10 mM Hepes), a pH change during the action of cytochrome-c oxidase
could not be more than 0.001 pH units. Therefore, the change of relative
ﬂuorescence due to pH change is negligible and can be ignored in our calcu-
lations.

3.9 Inﬂuence of indocyanine on the function of cytochrome-c

oxidase

In Fig. 10 the inﬂuence of indocyanine addition on the activity of cytochrome-
c oxidase is shown. After addition of cytochrome-c the turnover rate mea-
sured corresponded to 96 e− per s and heme aa3. Addition of indocyanine
(ﬁnal concentration 2.88 µM) increases the turnover rate by 10-15%. Nor-
mally the standard deviation of the oxygen consumption measurements lay
between 5-10%. Therefore, for more accurate measurements this deviation
should be taken into account but could be ignored for the present studies.

−1
ascorbate and 50 µM cytochrome-c. The turnover number (TN) is expressed in e− s−1 heme aa
3 .
Before indocyanine addition the TN was 95 s−1, after indocyanine addition the TN was 106 s−1.

3.10 The initial rate of membrane potential change

A biological membrane can be described physically by two parameters, the
speciﬁc membrane capacitance, Cm, and (leak) membrane conductance, Λm.
The change of the membrane potential, dU/dt, combines these parameters
and the electrogenic activity by the following relation:

dU
dt

=

np · e0 · ks · ν
A · Cm

− Λm · U
Cm

where np is the number of outside-out (functionally) oriented protein molecules
per vesicle, e0 the elementary charge, ks is the stoichiometry factor (translo-
cated protons per turnover), ν the turnover rate of the pump and A the aver-
age area of the vesicle membrane. Since immediately after enzyme activation
the membrane potential is close to 0, the leak current term, (ΛmU )/Cm, can
be neglected and eq. 13 reduces to [14, 33, 34]:

where K contains all substrate independent factors of Eq. 14:

This analysis shows that under standard conditions the initial rate of
membrane potential change depends only on the stoichiometry factor (ks)

and the turnover rate of cytochrome-c oxidase incorporated in the vesicle
membrane (ν). Fig. 11 shows a complete time course of an experiment.
For the calculation of the initial rate of the membrane potential generation
we have used the data from Fig. 9 in the range of 0 - 25 sec, ﬁtted to the
function U = Umax · [1 − exp (−t/τ )], and diﬀerentiated with respect to t
to obtain the initial rate (dU/dt) at time point 0. The greatest calculated
potential value reached was 79.05 mV and the initial rate of potential change
corresponded to 24.1 mV/sec. The variation of these two parameters could
be used further in the study of proton/electron stoichiometry of cytochrome-
c oxidase.

4 Discussion

The ability of lipophilic ﬂuorescent dyes to change their spectroscopic prop-
erties according to the membrane potential applied across the lipid bilayer
is well known [15, 16, 18]. The mechanism of voltage response of some
potential-sensitive dyes, on the other hand, is not understood so far [18, 30].
But in many cases, especially for cyanine or oxonol dyes, the response mech-
anism could be adequately described by a distribution model [13, 14, 28].
Depending on the polarity of its environment the indocyanine dye displays
diﬀerent ﬂuorescence emission spectra. The ﬂuorescence maximum shifts
to red wavelengths when the dye molecule moves from water into the lipid

18

phase (Fig. 2). The dye redistribution events can be detected by measuring
the ﬂuorescence change in the range 650 nm – 690 nm. In this paper the
use of the indocyanine dye to monitor membrane potential in vesicles with
cytochrome-c oxidase has been shown. Although it seems that a binding
model with a discrete number of binding sites is more suitable for the de-
scription of the dye-vesicle interaction, I show here that at high dye/vesicle
ratios the simple distribution model could be used. The restriction of this
method is the concentration of the vesicles, which should be in the range of
up to 30 µg/ml lipid at dye concentrations of about 2.5-2.9 µM. At 660 nm
we could register a relative ﬂuorescence change, ∆F/F , of 7 % per 10 mV
of membrane potential change.

The time resolution of this experimental set-up is determined mainly by
two time constants. First, the ”stirring time”, which is the time until the so-
lution reaches its homogeneity in the cuvette and second, the time response
of the ﬂuorescent dye. The stirring time was the main time limiting factor
and corresponded to 400 - 500 ms. The time response of the indocyanine
dye is considerably shorter. Ross et al. [32] observed a biphasic ﬂuorescence
signal from nerve axons stained with indocyanine after application of a volt-
age step, consisting of a fast component with a time constant below 100
µsec and a second slower component with a time constant of about 10 msec.
Since the turnover number of cytochrome-c oxidase is in the range of 50 –
100 sec−1, the response time of the indocyanine is short enough to detect
the change of the membrane potential without deformation even after one
enzyme turnover.

The time course of the relative ﬂuorescence change after the addition of
cytochrome-c was measured and used to calculate the membrane potential
change. Extrapolation of this voltage course to the time point 0, gives us
a function of the membrane potential development with time. By diﬀeren-
tiation of this function, the initial rate of potential change was determined.
The initial potential change is a parameter independent of the permeabil-
ity of the lipid membrane. The permeability of the liposome membrane to
protons is rather high (comparable to K+ and Na+ ions) [35]. Therefore, es-
timation of the initial potential change would be helpful in investigations of
the electrogenic activity of cytochrome-c oxidase. The further improvement
of this method in order to reduce the ”stirring time” will allow the recording
of rapid kinetics of the membrane potential development and, consequently,
the resolving of proton translocation events induced by cytochrome-c oxi-
dase.

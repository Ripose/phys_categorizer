We study the middle cerebral artery blood ﬂow velocity (MCAfv) in humans using transcranial
Doppler ultrasonography (TCD). Scaling properties of time series of the axial ﬂow velocity averaged
over a cardiac beat interval may be characterized by two exponents. The short time scaling exponent
(STSE) determines the statistical properties of ﬂuctuations of blood ﬂow velocities in short-time
intervals while the Hurst exponent describes the long-term fractal properties. In many migraineurs
the value of the STSE is signiﬁcantly reduced and may approach that of the Hurst exponent. This
change in dynamical properties reﬂects the signiﬁcant loss of short-term adaptability and the overall
hyperexcitability of the underlying cerebral blood ﬂow control system. We call this eﬀect fractal
rigidity.

Migraine headaches have been the bane of humanity
for centuries, aﬄicting such notables as Ceasar, Pascal,
Kant, Beethoven, Chopin, and Napoleon. However, their
aetiology and pathomechanism have not to date been sat-
isfactorily elucidated. Herein we demonstrate that the
scaling properties of the time series associated with cere-
bral blood ﬂow (CBF) signiﬁcantly diﬀer between those
of normal healthy individuals and migraineurs. The re-
sults of our data analysis show that the complex patho-
physiology of migraine frequently leads to hyperexcitabil-
ity of the cerebral ﬂow control system.

Physiological signals, such as CBF time series, are typ-
ically generated by complex self-regulatory systems that
process inputs with a broad range of accessible values.
Even though this type of time series may ﬂuctuate in an
irregular and complex manner, they frequently exhibit
self-aﬃne or fractal properties which can be character-
ized by a single global parameter – the fractal dimension
D or equivalently the Hurst exponent H (D = 2 − H)[1].
The salient property of mathematical random fractal
process is the existence of long-range correlations for
H 6= 1/2. The studies of the cardiac beat-to-beat vari-
ability have shown the existence of strong long-range
correlations in healthy subjects and demonstrated the
breakdown of correlations in disease [2] (see also [3] and
references therein). A similar pattern was observed in
ﬂuctuations in the stride interval in human gait. The
strength of correlations was signiﬁcantly reduced both
by aging and a neurodegenerative disease. This eﬀect is

frequently referred to as the loss of complexity [4, 5, 6, 7].
Complexity decreases with the convergence of the Hurst
exponent on H = 1/2.

A healthy human brain is perfused by blood ﬂowing
laminarly through the cerebral vessels providing brain
tissue with substrates such as oxygen and glucose.
It
turns out that CBF is relatively stable with typical values
between 45 and 65 ml/100g of brain tissue per second,
despite variations in systemic pressure as large as 100
T orr. This phenomenon is known as cerebral autoreg-
ulation and has been thoroughly documented not only
in humans but also in animals [8, 9]. Autoregulation,
which is mainly associated with changes in cerebrovas-
cular resistance (CVR) of small precapillary brain arter-
ies, is only one of at least four major mechanisms that
regulate CBF. A considerable body of evidence suggests
that CBF is inﬂuenced by local cerebral metabolic ac-
tivity. As metabolic activity increases so does ﬂow and
vice versa. The actual coupling mechanism underlying
this metabolic regulation is unknown but most likely it in-
volves certain vasoactive compounds (which aﬀect the di-
ameter of cerebral vessels) such as adenosine, potassium,
prostaglandines which are locally produced in response to
metabolic activity. External chemical regulation is pre-
dominantly associated with the strong inﬂuence of CO2
on cerebral vessels. An increase in carbon dioxide arterial
content leads to marked dilation of vessels (vasolidation)
which in turn boosts CBF while a decrease produces mild
vasoconstriction and slows down CBF. The impact of the

sympathetic nervous system on CBF is often ignored but
intense sympathetic activity results in vasoconstriction.
This type of neurogenic regulation can also indirectly af-
fect cerebral ﬂow via its inﬂuence on autoregulation.

The complex cerebral ﬂow regulation mechanisms are
supposed to be inﬂuenced or even to be fundamentally
altered in many pathological states. However, despite
the signiﬁcant advances in brain diagnostic imaging tech-
niques many functional aspects of CBF regulation are not
fully understood [10]. For example, migraine – a preva-
lent, hemicranial (asymmetric) headache is among the
least understood diseases. In migraine without aura at-
tacks may involve nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light,
sound, or movement. These associated symptoms distin-
guish migraine from ordinary tension-type headaches. In
about 15% of migraineurs headache is preceded by one
or more focal neurological symptoms, collectively known
as the aura. In migraine with aura the associated symp-
toms may include transient visual disturbances, march-
ing unilateral paresthesias and numbness or weakness in
an extremity or the face, language disturbances, and ver-
tigo [11, 12]. According to the leading hypothesis, mi-
graine results from a dysfunction of brain-stem or dien-
cephalic nuclei that normally modulate sensory input and
exert neural inﬂuence on cranial vessels, see, for example,
[12, 13] and references therein. Thus, the fundamental
question arises as to whether migraine can signiﬁcantly
inﬂuence cerebral hemodynamics. Some experimental
data reveal clear interhemispheric blood ﬂow asymme-
try in some parts of the brain of migraineurs even during
headache-free intervals [14, 15, 16].

Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography enables high-
resolution measurement of MCA ﬂow velocity. Even
though this technique does not allow us to directly de-
termine CBF values, it may help to elucidate the na-
ture and role of vascular abnormalities associated with
migraine. Some previous studies have shown signiﬁcant
changes in cerebrovascular reactivity in migraine patients
[17]. In this work we look for the signature of the mi-
graine pathology in the scaling properties of the human
MCAfv time series.

The dynamical aspects of the cerebral blood ﬂow reg-
ulation were recognized by Zhang et al. [18]. Keunen et
al. [19, 20] applied the attractor reconstruction technique
along with the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm and the
concept of surrogate data to look for the manifestations of
the nonlinear dynamics in continuous waveforms of TCD
signals. Rossitti and Stephensen [21] used the relative
dispersion of the MCAfv velocity time series to reveal
its fractal nature. West et al. [22] extended this line of
research by taking into account the more general prop-
erties of fractal time series. Both studies [21, 22] showed
that the beat-to-beat variability in the ﬂow velocity has
a long-time memory and is persistent with the average
value of the Hurst exponent H = 0.85 ± 0.04, a value
consistent with that found earlier for interbeat interval

2

time series of the human heart. Finally, West et al ob-
served that cerebral blood ﬂow is multifractal in nature
[23].

We measured MCAfv using the Multidop T DWL Elek-
tronische Systeme ultrasonograph. The 2-MHz Doppler
probes were placed over the temporal windows and ﬁxed
at a constant angle and position. The measurements were
taken continuously for approximately two hours in the
subjects at supine rest. The study comprised 15 healthy
individuals and 33 migraineurs (14 had migraine with
aura and the others had migraine without aura). Mi-
graine was diagnosed according to the guidelines of the
Headache Classiﬁcation Committee of the International
Headache Society [24]. An example of a typical measured
MCAfv time series is shown in Fig. 1 for the ﬁrst thou-
sand of the recorded beats of the subject’s heart. The
total time series has over eight thousand data points for
a two hour data record.

Successive increments of mathematical fractal random
processes are independent of the time step. They are cor-
related with the coeﬃcient of correlation ρ which is deter-
mined by the formula 22H = 2 + 2ρ. Thus for H 6= 1/2
there exist long-range correlations, that is, ρ 6= 0.
It
turns out the Hurst exponent also determines the scaling
properties of the fractal time series.
If y(t) is a frac-
tal process with Hurst exponent H, then yc = y(ct)/cH
is another fractal process with the same statistics. The
variance of self-aﬃne time series is proportional to ∆t2H
where ∆t is the time interval between measurements. A
number of algorithms which are commonly used to cal-
culate the Hurst exponent are based on this property.

Herein we employ the detrended ﬂuctuation analysis
(DFA) introduced into the study of biomedical time series
N
by Peng et al. [25]. Let {vi}
i=1 be the experimental time
series of the middle cerebral artery blood ﬂow velocity
(MCAfv) v. First, the time series is aggregated: y(k) =
k
i=1(vi − ¯v), k = 1, .., N , where ¯v is the average velocity.
P
Then, for segments of the aggregated time series of length
n the following quantity is calculated:

F (n) =

[y(k) − yn0(k)]2,

(1)

1
n

v
u
u
t

n+n0

X
k=n0

where yn0 is a least square line ﬁt to the data segment
which starts at n0 and ends at n + n0. The bar in the
above equation denotes an average over all possible start-
ing points n0 of data segments of length n. Thus, for a
given data box size n, F (n) gives the characteristic size of
ﬂuctuations of the aggregated and detrended time series.
If the aggregated time-series is fractal then F (n) ∼ nH ,
so one obtains the Hurst exponent from a linear least-
square ﬁt to F (n) on double log graph paper. However,
West has emphasized [1, 22] the importance of possible
periodic modulations of quantities such as F (n). These
modulations may be accounted for with the help of the

following ﬁt function:

FX (n) = n

exp[α + λ cos(γ ln n)].

(2)

H

Here again the Hurst exponent is determined by the slope
of the ﬁtting curve, but now the curve also has a harmonic
modulation in the logarithm of the length n of the data
segment.

Fig. 2 shows the typical DFA analysis for a healthy
subject. The circles in this ﬁgure are the calculated val-
ues of F (n) and the solid line is the best renormalization
group ﬁt, cf. Eqn. (2). The best-ﬁt parameters are given
in the inset.
It is apparent from this graph that frac-
tal properties of the cerebral ﬂow, as indicated by the
quality of the ﬁt, are well pronounced only for time in-
tervals larger than approximately 32 cardiac beats. Scal-
ing properties for shorter intervals are distinctly diﬀerent
and may be characterized by a short time scaling expo-
nent (STSE). The slope of the grey line in Fig. 2 yields
the value of the STSE. The average value of the STSE
for the control group was 1.34 ± 0.11 while the average
Hurst exponent was H = 0.80 ± 0.10. The averaging was
done over 36 calculations such as the one shown in Fig.
2. We would like to point out that the values of both
exponents are not aﬀected by a scaling of the time series
amplitude and do not depend on the series’s mean value
cf. (1).

To elucidate the nature of the two scaling regions char-
acteristic of healthy individuals let us consider the follow-
ing one-dimensional map:

vi+1 = vi − bvi +

+ ξi,

(3)

avi−τ
1 + v10
i−τ

which models the ﬂuctuations of the blood ﬂow velocity
averaged over a cardiac beat. The map is reminiscent of
the Mackey-Glass diﬀerential equation originally intro-
duced to describe production of white blood cells [26].
The role of the linear term in the above equation is to
dampen out ﬂuctuations. The nonlinear positive feed-
back term with delay is the source of long-range correla-
tions. ξ is a random variable which mimics the stochastic
component of the cerebral hemodynamics. In this work
we choose ξ to be normally distributed with zero mean
and standard deviation σ. We call the diﬀerence equa-
tion (3) a cerebral blood ﬂow map (CBFM). Fig. 3 shows
the DFA of a time series generated by the CBFM with
the parameters b = 0.10, a = 0.05, τ = 15 and σ = 0.20.
The map clearly exhibits the characteristics of the exper-
imental data including the distinct crossover.

It turns out that the scaling properties of the MCAfv
time series may be profoundly inﬂuenced by the migraine
pathophysiology.
In our study, for about 40% of mi-
graineurs the value of the STSE is signiﬁcantly reduced
and may closely approach the value of the Hurst expo-
nent cf. Figs. 4 and 5. On the other hand, for both the
migraineurs with aura and without the average Hurst

3

exponent is the same as that of the control group. The
CBFM provides the insight into dynamical origin of this
eﬀect. The value of the STSE is dependent mainly on
the strength of the damping b. With increasing b the
STSE decreases. However, to maintain approximately
constant value of the Hurst exponent the strength of the
positive-feedback term a must also increase. Fig. 6 ex-
empliﬁes this behavior (the time series was iterated with
the following parameters: b = 0.45, a = 0.35, τ = 15 and
σ = 0.20). Thus, the reduction of the STSE observed in
the experimental data is the result of the excessive damp-
ening of the cerebral ﬂow ﬂuctuations and is the mani-
festation of the signiﬁcant loss of adaptability and over-
all hyperexcitablity of the underlying regulation system.
We call this novel eﬀect fractal rigidity. We would like
to emphasize that hyperexcitabity of the cerebral blood
ﬂow control system seems to be physiologically consis-
tent with the reduced activation level of cortical neurons
observed in some transcranial magnetic stimulation and
evoked potential studies [10, 11, 13, 27] and references
therein.

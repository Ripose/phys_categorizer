Abstract

The diﬀusion-controlled limit of reaction times for site-speciﬁc DNA-binding proteins is derived

from ﬁrst principles. We follow the generally accepted concept that a protein propagates via two

competitive modes, a three-dimensional diﬀusion in space and a one-dimensional sliding along the

DNA. However, our theoretical treatment of the problem is new. The accuracy of our analytical

model is veriﬁed by numerical simulations. The results conﬁrm that the unspeciﬁc binding of

protein to DNA, combined with sliding, is capable to reduce the reaction times signiﬁcantly.

Introduction. The understanding of diﬀusion controlled chemical reactions has become

an indispensable ingredient of present days technological development. The optimization of

catalysts, fuel cells, improved batteries using electrodes with nano-structured surfaces or the

function of semi-conductive devices are just a few of countless examples where diﬀusive pro-

cesses, often in crowded or fractal environments, are involved to deﬁne the most important

system parameters. For any living organism, diﬀusion plays the central role in biochemical

and -physical reactions that keep the system alive [1, 2]: The transport of molecules through

cell membranes, of ions passing the synaptic gap or drugs on the way to their protein re-

ceptors are predominantly diﬀusive processes. Further more, essentially all of the biological

functions of DNA are performed by proteins that interact with speciﬁc DNA sequences [3, 4],

and these reactions are diﬀusion-controlled.

However, it has been realized that some proteins are able to ﬁnd their speciﬁc target sites

on DNA much more rapidly than is “allowed” by the diﬀusion limit [1, 5, 6]. It is therefore

generally accepted that some kind of facilitated diﬀusion must take place in these cases.

Several mechanisms, diﬀering in details, have been proposed for it. All of them essentially

involve two steps. First, the protein binds to a random non-speciﬁc DNA site. Second,

it diﬀuses (slides) along the DNA chain. These two steps may be reiterated many times

before the protein actually ﬁnds the target, since the sliding is occasionally interrupted by

dissociation.

Berg et al. have provided a thorough (but somewhat sophisticated) theory that allows an

estimation of the resulting reaction rates [5]. Recently, Halford and Marko have presented

a comprehensive review on this subject and proposed a remarkably simple semiquantitative

approach that explicitly contains the mean sliding length as a parameter of the theory [6].

In the present work we suggest an alternative view on the problem starting from ﬁrst

principles. Our theory leads to a formula that is similar in form to that of Halford and

Marko, apart from numerical factors.

In particular, we give a new interpretation of the

sliding length, which makes it possible to relate this quantity to experimentally accessible

parameters.

Theory. To estimate the mean time τ required for a protein to ﬁnd its target, we consider

a single DNA chain in a large volume V . At time t = 0, the protein molecule is somewhere

outside the DNA coil. We introduce the ‘reaction coordinate’ r as the distance between the

center of the protein and the center of the target, which is assumed to be presented in one

2

copy. When r is large, the only transport mechanism is the 3-dimensional (3d) diﬀusion in

space. On the contrary, at small r, the 1-dimensional (1d) diﬀusion along the DNA chain is

more eﬃcient.

Let us deﬁne the eﬃciency of a transport mechanism in more strict terms. Let τ (r

dr, r)

be the mean time of the ﬁrst arrival of the protein at the distance (r

dr) from the target,

provided it starts from the distance r. In the simple cases, when the diﬀusion of a particle

can be fully characterized by a single coordinate, this time is given by the equation [7, 8]

where D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, ρ(r) the equilibrium distribution function of the particle

along the reaction coordinate (not necessary normalized), and Z(r) the local normalizing

factor

Z(r) =

ρ(r′) dr′ .

−
dr (so that the smaller distances from

→

has the dimension of velocity and can be regarded as a measure for the eﬃciency of a

transport process.

For a 3d-diﬀusion we have ρ(r) = 4π r2c, where c is the protein concentration and the

factor 4π is chosen for further convenience. Hence, for suﬃciently small r, when Z(r)

Z(0) = 1, the transport eﬃciency is

In the case of a 1d-diﬀusion along the DNA chain we have ρ(r) = 2σ, with σ being the

linear density of a non-speciﬁcally bound protein. The factor 2 accounts for the fact that

the target can be reached from two opposite directions. We assume, again, that the distance

r is suﬃciently small, so that the DNA axis can be considered as a straight line. Thus, the

eﬃciency of the 1d-diﬀusive transport near the target is given by

Our main assumption is that, during the combined diﬀusion process, the probability of the

(non-speciﬁcally) bound state is close to its equilibrium value for each given value of r.

Then the frequencies 1/dτ3d and 1/dτ1d are additive, and so are the eﬃciencies of the two

transport mechanisms given by Eqs. (4) and (5). Hence, the mean time of the ﬁrst arrival

at the target of radius a can be found as

The main contribution to this integral is made by the distances close to a. For that reason,

the upper limit of integration is set to inﬁnity. Before evaluation of Eq. (6), we note that

τ =

1 = Z(0) = V c + Lσ ,

where V is the volume and L is the DNA length. The meaning of this equation is that the

system contains only one protein molecule. Substituting Eqs. (4) and (5) into Eq. (6) and

taking into account Eq. (7), we get, ﬁnally,

Here, we have introduced a new parameter

ξ =

r

with K = σ/c being the equilibrium constant of non-speciﬁc binding. It is easy to verify

that ξ is just the distance, where the eﬃciencies of the two transport mechanisms [Eqs. (4)

and (5)] become equal to each other.

Numerical model. In what follows we present numerical simulations to test the accu-

racy of our analytical result for the reaction time given by Eqs. (8) and (9). In order to

approximate the real biological situation, the DNA was modeled by a chain of N straight

segments of equal length l0.

Its mechanical stiﬀness was deﬁned by the bending energy

associated with each chain joint:

Eb = kBT α θ2 ,

(10)

where kBT is the Boltzmann factor, α the dimensionless stiﬀness parameter, and θ the

bending angle. The numerical value of α deﬁnes the persistence length, i.e. the “stiﬀness”

of the chain [9]. The excluded volume eﬀect was taken into account by introducing the

4

eﬀective DNA diameter, deﬀ. The conformations of the chain, with the distances between

non-adjacent segments smaller than deﬀ, were forbidden. The target of speciﬁc binding was

assumed to lie exactly in the middle of the DNA. The whole chain was packed in a spherical

volume (cell) of radius R in such a way that the target occupied the central position.

In order to achieve a close packing of the chain inside the cell, we used the following

algorithm. First, a relaxed conformation of the free chain was produced by the standard

Metropolis Monte-Carlo (MC) method. For the further compression, we deﬁned the center-

norm (c-norm) as the maximum distance from the target (the middle point) to the other

parts of the chain. Then, the MC procedure was continued with one modiﬁcation. Namely,

a MC step was rejected if the c-norm was exceeding 105% of the lowest value registered so

far. The procedure was stopped when the desired degree of compaction was obtained.

The protein was modeled as a random walker within the cell with reﬂecting boundaries.

During one step in the free 3d-mode, it was displaced by the distance ε3d in a random

direction. Once the walker approached the chain closer than a certain capture radius rc, it

was placed to the nearest point on the chain and its movement mode was changed to the

1d-sliding along the chain contour. In this mode, the step represented a displacement by the

distance ε1d performed with an equal probability in either direction. The ends of the chain

were reﬂective. After each 1d-step (and immediately after the capture) the walker could

jump oﬀ the chain by the distance rc and reenter the 3d-mode. This operation was carried

out with the kick-oﬀ probability p.

A simulation cycle started with the walker at the periphery of the cell and ended when

the walker came within the distance a to the target. During all simulation cycles the chain

conformation remained ﬁxed.

Below in this paper, one step is chosen as the unit of time and one persistence length of

the DNA chain (50 nm) as the unit of distance. The following values of parameters were

used. The length of one segment was chosen as l0 = 0.2, so that one persistence length

was partitioned into 5 segments. The corresponding value of the stiﬀness parameter was

α = 2.403 [9]. The eﬀective chain diameter was deﬀ = 0.12, the capture radius rc = deﬀ/2,

and the radius of the active site was a = 0.08. The diﬀusion coeﬃcients are deﬁned as

D3d = ε2

3d/6 and D1d = ε2

yielding identical diﬀusion coeﬃcients D3d = D1d = 8

1d/2. The step-size of the walker was ε3d = 0.04 and ε1d = ε3d/√3,
10−4/3.

The radius R of the cell and the DNA length L were varied in diﬀerent sets of simulation.

R = 2 and chain lengths L = 56, 40, 24, 8 (top to bottom). The curves are plots of Eq. (8).

For each ﬁxed pair (R,L), the kick-oﬀ probability was initially set to p = 1 (no 1d-transport,
2−i, i = 1, 2, . . . , 11. For each parameter set,

ξ = 0) and subsequently reduced to pi

the simulation cycle was repeated 2000 times. The equilibrium constant K required for

the calculation of the parameter ξ [Eq. (9)] has to be determined as the ratio V τ1d/Lτ3d,

where τ1d and τ3d are the average times the walker spent in the bound and the free states,

respectively. Note that ξ depends on the choice of the probability p, but not on cell size

or chain length, since τ1d

Results. In a ﬁrst set of simulations, chains of various lengths between L = 8 and L = 56

were packed into a cell of radius R = 2 and volume V0 = 4πR3/3 = 32π/3. The resulting

averaged reaction times τ are plotted in Fig. 1 as a function of the variable ξ [Eq. (9)]. The

curves are plots of Eq. (8). It is obvious that the above relation was well able to reproduce

the simulation results on a quantitative level. This good agreement between theoretical and

computational model indicates that the derivation of Eq. (8), although quite simple, already

contains the essential ingredients of the underlying transport process. A moderate deviation

between simulation and theory is visible in case of L = 56 and large values of ξ. In the

discussion we will shortly touch the limits of the theoretical approach if ξ becomes very

large. With the present selection of chain-parameters, the results prove that a 1d-sliding

can speed up the reaction time signiﬁcantly. If, however, the unspeciﬁc binding becomes

too strong, its eﬀect turns into the opposite and the reaction time is increasing. The most

eﬃcient transport is achieved with a balanced contribution of both 1d- and 3d-diﬀusion.

In a second set of simulations, the longest chain of L = 56 was placed into cells of

increasing sizes, with volumes of two, four and eight times the initial value V0 = 32π/3,

leading to systems of rather sparse chain densities. Figure 2 displays the results. The

plots of Eq. (8) are again in good overall agreement with the simulation results, although a

systematic deviation in case of large cell volumes, i.e. at low chain densities, is visible. The

theoretical approach seems to under-predict the reaction time by up to 10%. A systematic

investigation of the limits of our approach is part of ongoing research. For the time being

we note that in crowded environments (of high chain density) Eq. (8) appears to be more

accurate than in sparse environments. The results demonstrate that with decreasing chain

density a higher aﬃnity for unspeciﬁc binding becomes favorable to reduce the reaction time.

This is no surprise since the chance for the protein to bind un-speciﬁcally to the chain is

much smaller compared to a crowded environment, so that each kick leads to a longer period

of free diﬀusion inside a large volume. The chance to hit the target is therefore increased if

the protein remains in sliding-mode over a rather long distance.

Discussion. Recently, Halford and Marko have proposed a remarkably simple semiquan-

titative approach to estimate the reaction time [6], yielding the expression

which is of identical functional form if we identify ξ with the sliding length of Halford and

Marko. With Eq. (9) we are now able to express lsl in terms of experimentally accessible

quantities, assigning a physical meaning to a previously heuristic model parameter. Addi-

tionally, Eq. (12) contains the numerical factors which turn the initially semi-quantitative

approach into a model of quantitative accuracy.

The limits of our new approach are presently under investigation. The basic assumption

made in the derivation of Eq. (6) was the chemical equilibrium between the free and the

non-speciﬁcally bound states of the walker.

In case of high aﬃnity of the protein to the

DNA, i.e. large values of ξ, this assumption may not be justiﬁed, since the protein always

starts in free diﬀusion mode at the periphery of the cell. The violation of that assumption

may become more serious if the chain density inside the cell is low so that the protein has to

search for a long time before it is able to bind to the DNA for the ﬁrst time. Additionally,

in order to evaluate the eﬃciency of 1d-diﬀusion [Eq. (5)], it was assumed that the DNA

axis could be considered as a straight line over the distance of 1d-diﬀusion. This is satisﬁed

if the sliding length is smaller than the persistence length of the chain, i.e., ξ < 1.

In summary, the relation (8), derived from ﬁrst principles, provides a quantitative esti-

mate for the reaction time of a protein that is moving under the control of two competitive

transport mechanisms in a crowded environment. Although drawing an idealized picture

of the living cell, it will serve as the starting point for more realistic approaches, equipped

with additional parameters that are subsequently calibrated in sophisticated simulations.

The sliding parameter ξ [Eq. (9)] connects the heuristic sliding length of Halford et al. to

experimentally accessible quantities. The simulations, although so far performed on a lim-

ited range of system parameters, conﬁrm earlier results that an unspeciﬁc binding combined

with a 1d-diﬀusion mode enables for a signiﬁcant speed-up of the reaction. The relation

(8) can be used to extend the investigations to system sizes which are not easily accessible

in numerical simulations such as those presented in this work: The size of a realistic cell

nucleus is of the order of ten microns and it contains DNA chains adding up to a length of

the order of meters.

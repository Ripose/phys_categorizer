MODELLING AND SIMULATIONS OF MULTI-COMPONENT LIPID
MEMBRANES AND OPEN MEMBRANES VIA DIFFUSIVE
INTERFACE APPROACHES∗

XIAOQIANG WANG† AND QIANG DU‡

Abstract. In this paper, phase ﬁeld models are developed for multi-component vesicle mem-
branes with diﬀerent lipid compositions and membranes with free boundary. These models are used
to simulate the deformation of membranes under the elastic bending energy and the line tension
energy with prescribed volume and surface area constraints. By comparing our numerical simula-
tions with recent experiments, it is demonstrated that the phase ﬁeld models can capture the rich
phenomena associated with the membrane transformation, thus it oﬀers great functionality in the
simulation and modeling of multicomponent membranes.

1. Introduction. Lipid vesicle membranes are ubiquitous in biological systems.
Studies of vesicle self assembly and shape transition, including bud formation [24, 25,
31] and vesicle ﬁssion [13] are very important in the understanding of cell functions.
In recent experimental studies, multi-component vesicles with diﬀerent lipid molecule
compositions (and thus phases) have been shown to display even more complex mor-
phology involving rafts and micro-domains [2]. There are strong evidences suggesting
that phase segregation and interaction contribute critically to the membrane signaling,
traﬃcking and sorting processes [3]. In the literature, the geometric and topological
structures of multi-component vesicles have been theoretically modeled by minimizing
an energy with contributions of the bending resistance, that is the elastic bending en-
ergy, and the line tension at the interface between diﬀerent components or the phase
boundary [4, 20, 23, 26]. The elastic bending energy ﬁrst studied by Canham, Evans
and Helfrich [11, 12, 28] for a single-phase membrane is deﬁned as

E =

a1 + a2(H

ZΓ (cid:0)

ds,

(1.1)

where H is the mean curvature of the membrane surface Γ, c0 the spontaneous cur-
vature, G the Gaussian curvature, a1 the surface tension, a2 the bending rigidity and
a3 the stretching rigidity.

In recent experimental studies, it has been found that the bending rigidity in the
liquid-disordered phase diﬀers from that in the liquid-ordered phase in two-component
membranes [2, 3]. This can be attributed to, among other things, that the two phases
have diﬀerent lipid compositions or diﬀerent concentrations of cholesterol molecules
which serve as spacers between lipids. Thus, in the generalized bending elasticity
model for two-component membranes, the bending rigidity a2 is assumed to take
values k1 and k2 respectively in two diﬀerent components (phases) Γ1
Γ
Γ2). The common phase boundary between the two phases is denoted
(with Γ = Γ1
∪
by γ0 = Γ1
Γ2. In general, the other parameters may also vary in diﬀerent phases,
however, in this paper, we ignore the eﬀect due to a1, a3 and c0 and concentrate only
on the eﬀect of the bending rigidity, though the methodology can be easily extended to
more general case. In fact, the formulation we present here works for two components

having possibly diﬀerent spontaneous curvatures, but for simplicity such curvatures
are set to be zero in the numerical simulations.

With the two phases co-existing on the membrane, it is natural to introduce a
line tension on γ0 to take into account the interfacial energy between the individual
components [2, 22, 31]. Coupling with the bending elastic energy, this leads to the
following total energy determining the two component membrane

(1.2)

where δ is the line tension constant [22]. Note that in general, the line energy can
also include the integral of a multiple of the curvature square on γ0 [3].

The mathematical model that our study is based on is the minimization of the
total energy deﬁned in (1.2) for a two component membrane with a prescribed to-
tal volume, and prescribed surface areas of both components. In order to eﬀectively
model and simulate the experimental ﬁndings on the exotic morphology of the multi-
component vesicles (mostly taken from [2]), we extend the recently developed phase
ﬁeld approach for the single component vesicles [18] to the multi-component case,
which avoids the tracking of the vesicle membrane by viewing the surface and phase
boundary as the zero level sets of phase ﬁeld functions. The general phase ﬁeld frame-
work has been used successfully in many applications [1, 6, 9, 10]. For membrane de-
formation, this approach has become increasing popular in the research community in
recent years. So far, its applications have mostly conﬁned to the case of using a single
phase ﬁeld function [5, 15, 16, 21, 27], albeit it is known that co-dimension two objects
can be described eﬀectively by a pair of level-set or phase ﬁeld functions [7, 10, 29, 32].
With the introduction of a second phase ﬁeld function, we demonstrate that the new
two-component phase ﬁeld model is capable of capturing rich complex morphological
changes experimentally observed in the two-component vesicle membranes. Moreover,
this model can be very easily generalized to study the open membranes or membranes
with free boundary (see [30] for experimental study and [8, 33, 34, 35, 37] for analysis
and computation). This is based on the observation that an open membrane can be
thought as a two component vesicles with one component having zero bending rigidity.
Further generalization is possible for vesicles with three or more components.

The paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we present the phase ﬁeld formu-
lation of the total energy (1.2) and address the approach of penalty formulation for
the constraints. In section 3, we ﬁrst brieﬂy discuss the discretization schemes and
some implementation issue. After presenting some convergence tests to validate our
method, we assemble a number of interesting experiments to explore the shape trans-
formations due to the changes of diﬀerent parameters. The numerical simulations are
compared with experimental ﬁndings including the merge and splitting of diﬀerent
components. In section 5, we present the phase ﬁeld formulation for open membranes
and some numerical simulation results. We then make some conclusion remarks in
section 6. Some technical derivations are provided in the appendix.

In the phase ﬁeld modelling, the functions η and φ are forced to be nearly constant
valued except in thin regions near the surfaces Γ and Γ
respectively. We use two
small positive constant parameters ǫ and ξ to characterize the widths of the thin
regions (also called the diﬀusive interfaces). We note that a phase ﬁeld function
(order parameter), like our η, has been introduced in [21, 27] to describe the phase
segregation on the membranes, but diﬀerent from our phase ﬁeld description of the
surface Γ, an explicit construction of the membrane surface and a direct computation
of the bending elastic energy are used there instead of the phase ﬁeld representation
of the membrane surface.

To re-cap the discussion, the total energy in the phase ﬁeld two-component model

and

is

while the constraints are given by

(φ, η) = E(φ, η) + L(φ, η) ,

V (φ) = vd, A(φ) = a0, D(φ, η) = ad,

with vd, at and ad being the prescribed volume diﬀerence (hence the interior volume is
prescribed), the total surface area and the area diﬀerence between the two components
(hence areas of both components are prescribed).

To maintain the consistency of the phase ﬁeld model which is based on φ and
η having the tanh proﬁles and the orthogonality between Γ and Γ
, additional con-
straints are imposed. First of all, the orthogonality constraint on the normal direc-
tions of the two surfaces, written in our phase ﬁeld formulations, can be enforced by
. With φ and η

having tanh proﬁles, their gradients become small away from their zero level sets, the
orthogonality constraint may thus be enforced everywhere by penalizing

Secondly, to better maintain the tanh proﬁle of η, especially for the case with a large
line tension energy, we have two options, one is to add a small regularization term,
much like the bending elastic energy for φ but with a very small bending rigidity;
another option is to regularize through the following functional

Summarizing the above, the variational phase ﬁeld model to describe the two-
component vesicles in the energy minimizing state is to minimize the total energy
(φ, η) = E(φ, η)+L(φ, η) with constraints V (φ) = α1, A(φ) = α2, D(φ, η) = α3 while

N (φ, η) and P (η) remain small. So, by adding both the penalty and regularization
terms, the vesicle surface and the two components phase boundary are determined by
a pair of phase functions (φ, η) which minimizes the energy

3. Numerical Simulations of Two-Component Membranes. In this sec-
tion, we compute the minimum of the phase ﬁeld energy (2.13) by adopting a gradient

The monotone decreasing of the energy EM is ensured for t > 0. For simplicity, we
only consider the case where c1 = c2 = 0, this allows us to focus on examining how
the variation in the bending rigidity alone aﬀects the vesicle shape deformation and
the equilibrium conﬁgurations of two-component membranes. The more general cases
involving the spontaneous curvatures are to be considered in the future.

Discretization and code development.. We take the spatial computational domain
π, π]3 and assume that membranes are enclosed in the box. More-
as the box Ω = [
over, we choose to set ξ = ǫ in our numerical simulations. For the spatial discretization
of (3.1) in Ω, a Fourier spectral method is used. Due to the regularization eﬀect of
the ﬁnite transition layer, for ﬁxed ǫ and enough Fourier modes, the spectral method
is an eﬃcient way to solve (3.1) with the help of FFT routines [10]. A couple of
options are implemented for the time discretization, such as an explicit forward Euler
scheme or a semi-implicit Euler scheme [17]. The time step ∆t is chosen to ensure the
energy decay. For most of our numerical experiments, although fully adjustable, ∆t

Problem set up and initial proﬁles.. We now discuss how we choose various pa-
rameters in the simulations. Though in theory the gradient ﬂow can be started from
any pair of initial phase ﬁeld functions, a proper choice often speeds up the evolution
process and allows more eﬃcient solution of the equilibrium state. With the penalty
formulation, a particular constraint can be simply removed by setting the correspond-
ing penalty constant zero. For example, setting M2 = M3 = 0 would eliminate the
total area and area diﬀerence constraints. This fact can be utilized to ﬁnd good initial
phase ﬁeld functions.

For example, as illustrated in Figure.3.1, for a given r > 0, we may start from
two special phase ﬁeld functions as φ(x) = tanh( |
) where
z is the third component of x. This provides two hemispheres that represent the
two components (colored in red and blue respectively, or in gray-scale represented
by lighter and darker regions). Starting from this initial state, and setting M1 = 0
to eliminate the volume constraint, the sphere gradually becomes more elliptical due
to the presence of line tension, then further transform to a gourd like shape. We
may stop at an intermediate shape and add back the volume constraint. This would
provide a variety of initial shapes to be used in the simulations.

Convergence veriﬁcation.. For a particular numerical simulation, the quality of
the numerical result may be aﬀected by the choice of computational domain, the
parameter ǫ (the eﬀective width of the diﬀusive interface), the number of grid points,
and the choices of other parameters used in the simulation. The parameter ǫ is
generally taken to be a few percentage points of the domain size to ensure a relatively
sharp interfacial region and the consistency with the sharp interface description (the
0 limit). The mesh size is normally taken to be several times smaller than the

we here present results of some numerical tests on the convergence and performance

The ﬁrst set of experiments given in Figure 3.2 is designed to test the dependence
of the resolution of the phase ﬁeld function on the the parameter ǫ and grid size. We
take a shape similar to the previous experiment. First, we take a 643 grid but use

Having demonstrated the convergence of the numerical algorithms, we next study
the eﬀect of diﬀerent bending rigidities and various line tension constants. Then by
adjusting the bending rigidities in the two components and the line tension, we can
simulate the the vesicle shapes in experiment ﬁndings [2]. Unless noted otherwise,

Eﬀect of the bending rigidities.. The values of bending rigidities often play a key
role in forming various shapes of vesicles. Our ﬁrst experiment is a simulation of the
striped vesicles. We start from an initial shape where the red component is situated
in the center to give a stripe-looking vesicle. As shown in the ﬁrst row of the Figure
13.31, the initial shape
3.3, with parameters vd =
grows into a very regular stripe-looking ellipsoid shown in the middle of the ﬁrst row.
In this experiment, the bending rigidity for the red component is 1.0 whereas the blue
component is 3.0. With line tension being ﬁxed at 10.0, we then make a switch of the
bending rigidity of the two components. As shown in the right picture of the ﬁrst row,
the red component of the ellipsoid in the middle grows to a more cylindrical like shape.
Next, by preserving the bending rigidity of the blue component while increasing that
of the red component from 3.0 to 19.0, the red component shrinks in the middle
and we get a thinner center band as shown in the left picture of the second row. It
is obvious that the concave region has a smaller mean curvature. We can further
increase the area of the blue component by setting a0 = 33.46 and ad =
19.82, and
with bending rigidities 3.8 and 0.2 respectively for the red and blue components, we
get the middle picture of the second row in Figure 3.3. One can compare it with
the last picture found in actual experiments [2] though the diﬀerences of the bending
rigidities are not as signiﬁcant as those used here. In the ﬁnal shape, the center band
has the lowest mean curvature and it is occupied by the red component (having larger
bending rigidities).

−

Fig. 3.3. Diﬀerent values of bending rigidity lead to diﬀerent shapes of striped vesicles (the

right bottom picture is reproduced from [2]).

As expected, the numerical simulation shows that the component with a larger
bending rigidity is more likely to remain in regions with smaller values of mean cur-
vature.

Eﬀect of line tension constants.. By intuition, we expect that larger line tension
generally leads to a shorter interfacial line between two diﬀerent components. And the
line tension is balanced by the bending and elasticity force and the volume constraint.
In most of the cases, the volume constraint plays a key role in balancing a large line
tension as in the experiments illustrated by Figure 3.4 and 3.5.

In Figure 3.4, the pictures shown there correspond to equilibrium shapes with

the blue colored component is 3.5 while that of the red is 0.5. By increasing the
line tension, the individual components in the two-component vesicle become more
hemisphere like which are the results of the increasing eﬀect of line tension under the
same volume and surface area constraints.

Figure 3.5 gives an even more convincing example to the rupture and vesicle
ﬁssion observed in this process. As shown in Figure 3.5, we start from the top left
shape. While preserving vd, a0 and ad to be
13.31 respectively,
we increase signiﬁcantly the line tension from 10.0 to 100.0. The vesicle gradually
breaks its vertical symmetry and a small blue vesicle is separated and eventually
absorbed into the top portion through a process like Oswald ripening. Finally, the
vesicle (bottom-right picture of Figure 3.5) only contains two parts, much like the
shape observed in the experiments [2].

Comparison with other experimental results.. We now focus on the simulations
that mimic other two-component vesicle shapes observed in the experiments of [2],
similar to the results depicted in Figures 3.3 and 3.5.

As shown in the two rows of Figure 3.6, we carry out two simulations starting from
a shape given on the left. In both simulations, the red component has bending rigidity
3.0, and the blue component has bending rigidity 1.0. The line tension between two
components is 30.0. The parameter vd for volume constant is
218.00, and the surface
area parameter a0 is 29.46. The parameter ad giving the diﬀerence of surface areas
of the two components takes on the values 18.76 and
18.76 respectively. The ﬁnal
shapes of the two simulations are shown in the center pictures in both rows. One can
compare them with the right most experimental picture provided in [2].

The energy values of the two experiments illustrated in Figure 3.6 are given in Ta-
ble 3.3 with energy contributions listed for individual components and the line tension
from the phase boundary. We get almost the same line tension energy contribution,
but, as caused by the diﬀerence in the bending rigidities, the elastic bending energy
contributions diﬀer by a factor of 3, which is reﬂective of the ratio of the bending
rigidities.

We now turn to simulate a couple of other interesting shapes experimentally
observed in [2] as illustrated in the last pictures of Figure 3.7 and Figure 3.10 re-
In Figure 3.7, we ﬁrst start from a spherical surface which is divided
spectively.
into two components where one component occupies similar spherical caps in twelve
well-spaced locations on the membrane surface. The bending rigidity is 3.5 for the
red component and 0.5 for the blue component, and the line tension is 10.0. With a
larger surface area of the blue component and a smaller volume than those values for
the exact sphere, the blue component (with smaller bending rigidity) starts to bulge.
The parameters are taken respectively as vd =
174.17, a0 = 54.63 and ad = 11.01.
If we further increase the volume and enlarge the relative area of the blue compo-
167.00, while keeping a0 at 54.63 and changing ad to 5.00,
nent by increasing vd to
the resulting computed shape (the third picture in Figure 3.7) is very similar to the
experiment ﬁndings [2] (the last picture in Figure 3.7).

−

−

The shape corresponding to the third picture of Figure 3.7 stays as a near equilib-
rium (meta-stable) state for a range of parameter values. But if we further increase the
area of the blue component, for example, by setting ad = 2.5, further coarsening of the
blue components will take place. The merger of disconnected components continues,
much like the Oswald ripening eﬀect, and eventually transforms into shapes similar
to that presented earlier in Figures 3.2 and 3.4. The transformation is illustrated in
Figure 3.8.

Next, we take an initial membrane proﬁle similar to that in the second picture of
Figure 3.7. By setting vd =
203.00, a0 = 54.63 and ad = 5.00 so that both the total
volume and the area of the red components are decreased, we can then observe the
growth of bumps of the red component, leading to a shape shown in the right pictures
of Figure 3.9. Take other initial proﬁles, other equilibrium shapes as shown in the left
and center pictures in Figure 3.9 have also been observed in our simulations.

Fig. 3.9. Various shapes of two component membranes.

From Figure 3.9, it can be seen that the two-component vesicles may display very
rich patterns, even in the absence of spontaneous curvature eﬀect. One naturally may
wonder if some of them are experimentally observable. The next set of experiments
draws inspiration from the center and right ﬁgures of Figure 3.9 and leads to inter-
esting comparisons with similar experimental observations in [2]. We start with the
same phase ﬁeld φ as the proﬁle in the right picture of Figure 3.9, but use a modiﬁed η
such that the neck of the bumps are formed by the blue component as the case of the
center picture of Figure 3.9. This leads to an initial shape as shown in the left picture

of Figure 3.10. Setting the parameters as vd =
203.00, a0 = 54.63, and ad = 22.68,
we ﬁnally get a shape (center picture of Figure 3.10) very close to the experimentally
observed shape given in [2] (right picture of Figure 3.10).

Shapes depicted in 3.10 are fairly robust. In fact, with a slight modiﬁcation of the
ﬁnal shape and a rotation with a given angle, then we found that using the gradient
ﬂow, the equilibrium solution is again in the shape (except for a rotation). Results of
such calculations on both 643 and 963 grids are given for comparison.

4. Open liposomal membranes. In this section, we apply similar ideas to
model open lipid membranes. The transformations from vesicles to open membranes
and the reverse process from open membranes to vesicles were ﬁrst observed in [30].
Here, we only consider the one-component open membranes with speciﬁed surface
areas. The total energy of an open membrane Γ with edge γ0 may be conveniently
deﬁned as the sum of the elastic bending energy and the line tension energy [8, 33,
34, 35, 37]:

For simplicity, we set the surface tension a1 and the line tension δ, as two constants,
we also do not consider the contribution of the geodesic curvature term in the line
energy on the boundary. The eﬀects of surface tension, the Gaussian and spontaneous
curvatures are also ignored. Our problem is then to minimize the following total
energy

Most of the available numerical simulations for open membranes have largely
been conﬁned to axis-symmetric cases based on the variational calculation of the
above energy. We hereby develop a new phase ﬁeld model for open membranes, and
present some numerical simulations for the full three dimensional case to demonstrate
the eﬀectiveness of the model.

12

Phase ﬁeld model for open membranes.. We can treat open membranes as two
component membranes with one component having zero bending rigidity. Again, we
let γ0 be the intersection of two orthogonal surfaces Γ and Γ0 which are implicitly
deﬁned as the level-set of the functions φ and η respectively.

Now we denote c(η) = 1

2 (1 + tanh( η

ξ )), and let the line tension energy be still

formulated by L(φ, η) in (2.2), with the elastic bending energy of the membrane

Then, we can again use a gradient ﬂow like (3.1) to compute the equilibrium shapes
by a similar numerical scheme as that given in section 3.

Numerical simulations of open membranes. We now present some numerical sim-
ulations of open membranes and compare them with biological experimental ﬁndings.
Most of the model and simulation parameters are chosen to be in the same range as
that for the two component vesicle simulations in the earlier section.

Fig. 4.1. Open membranes with diﬀerent line tensions (the right most picture is reproduced

from [30]).

Figure 4.1 gives the simulation results of a simple open membrane. Starting
from a half sphere (the left picture), with bending rigidity k = 1.0 and line tension
δ = 1.0, we get an equilibrium shape shown in the second picture. If a larger line
tension δ = 1.28 is used, an equilibrium shape is reached as that in the third picture.
One can compare it with the right picture obtained in the biological experiments
described in [30]. We note that the elastic bending energy are 10.12 and 15.96 and
the line tension energy are 10.94 and 7.95 respectively for the solutions in the second
and third pictures.

The time evolution snapshots are given in Figure 4.2 where the line tension is
taken as δ = 25.0. The simulation results show that, when the line tension becomes
large enough, the open membrane becomes self-enclosed.

13

Fig. 4.2. Open membrane closes due to large line tension.

Finally, in Figure 4.3, we simulate a shape (the right picture) with three holes as
observed in an experiment of [30]. Starting from the left most picture corresponding
to an ellipsoid with three holes, setting the bending rigidity k = 1.0 and line tension
δ = 1.0, and following the gradient ﬂow of the energy, the initial shape starts to
deform ﬁrst into an intermediate shape given in the second picture. The computed
equilibrium shape is shown in the third picture which again shows striking similar to
the experimental ﬁnding.

5. Conclusion. In this paper, we formulated a phase ﬁeld model for the multi-
component vesicles membranes, and as a special case, the open membranes with free
edges. The models incorporate the eﬀect of the elastic bending energy together with
the line tension between each two components. Full three dimensional numerical
simulations presented here demonstrate that the experimental observations given in
[2] can be eﬀectively simulated by the phase ﬁeld bending elasticity and line ten-
sion model. Furthermore, the simulation results illustrate that many experimentally
observed exotic patterns such as bud formation and vesicle ﬁssion can appear in two-
component vesicles due to the inhomogeneous bending stiﬀness and the competition
of the bending energy and the interfacial line tension even without incorporating the
spontaneous curvature or the asymmetry of the bilayer.

In conclusion, we point out the this generalization of our diﬀusive interface model
to two component vesicle membranes ﬁts nicely into the previously established uniﬁed
framework for the derivation of dynamic and static equations and the development
of numerical algorithms and codes. Many issues remain to be examined in future
works. First, there maybe other more eﬀective ways in formulating the line tension
energy, including the use of geodesic curvature along the phase boundary, which may
be important to model the diﬀerence of the stretching rigidity in two components
[3]. Second, more rigorous analysis of our models are needed in the future. Third,
in our numerical simulations, we have not examined the eﬀect of the spontaneous
curvature as we have done for the one component case [15]. It is expected that more
complex shapes would be be discovered in this case. Moreover, the interaction of
multi-component vesicles with the ﬂuid and electric ﬁelds are also exciting topics to
be investigated further in the future.

Appendix: Justiﬁcation of the energy and constraints.. We now provide
some brief calculations to rationalize the deﬁnitions of the energy functional and the
constraints in the phase ﬁeld setting. Same as the discussion in [17], we can ﬁrst
illustrate that in a very broad ansatz, for small ǫ and ξ, minimizing W (φ, η) leads to
a phase ﬁeld function φ(x) which is approaching to tanh(d(x, Γ)/(√2ǫ)) as ǫ
0. In
fact for small ǫ, due to the uniform bound of the functional B, the region away from

that the diﬀerences between φ and η and the respective tanh proﬁles are second order
in ǫ which would allow us to rigorous derive the asymptotic limits (2.6-2.8).

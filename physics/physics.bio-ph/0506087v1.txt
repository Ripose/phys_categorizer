Abstract.

Ultra-wideband (UWB) electromagnetic pulses of nanosecond duration, or
nanopulses, have been recently approved by the Federal Communications Commission
for a number of various applications. They are also being explored for applications in
biotechnology and medicine. The simulation of the propagation of a nanopulse through
biological matter, previously performed using a two-dimensional ﬁnite diﬀerence-
time domain method (FDTD), has been extended here into a full three-dimensional
computation. To account for the UWB frequency range, a geometrical resolution of the
exposed sample was 0.25 mm, and the dielectric properties of biological matter were
accurately described in terms of the Debye model. The results obtained from three-
dimensional computation support the previously obtained results: the electromagnetic
ﬁeld inside a biological tissue depends on the incident pulse rise time and width, with
increased importance of the rise time as the conductivity increases; no thermal eﬀects
are possible for the low pulse repetition rates, supported by recent experiments. New
results show that the dielectric sample exposed to nanopulses behaves as a dielectric
resonator. For a sample in a cuvette, we obtained the dominant resonant frequency
and the Q-factor of the resonator.

Three-Dimensional FDTD Simulation of Biomaterial Exposure to Electromagnetic Nanopulses2

1. Introduction

The bioeﬀects of non-ionizing ultra-wideband (UWB) electromagnetic (EM) pulses of
nanosecond duration, or nanopulses, have not been studied in as much detail as the
eﬀects of continuous-wave (CW) radiation. Research on the eﬀects of high intensity EM
nanopulses is only a recent development in biophysics (Hu et al 2005, Schoenbach et al
2004). While it has been observed that nanopulses are very damaging to electronics,
their eﬀects on biological material are not very clear (Miller et al 2002). A typical
nanopulse has a width of few nanoseconds, a rise time on the order of 100 picoseconds,
an amplitude of up to several hundreds kilovolts, and a very large frequency bandwidth.
UWB pulses, when applied in radar systems, have a potential for better spatial
resolution, larger material penetration, and easier target information recovery (Taylor
1995). They were approved in 2002 by the Federal Communications Commission in
the U.S. for “applications such as radar imaging of objects buried under the ground
or behind walls and short-range, high-speed data transmissions” (FCC 2002).
It is,
therefore, very important to understand their interaction with biological materials.

Experiments which can provide a basis for nanopulse exposure safety standards
consist of exposing biological systems to UWB radiation. The basic exposure equipment
consists of a pulse generator, an exposure chamber, such as a gigahertz transverse
electromagnetic mode cell (GTEM), and measuring instruments (Miller et al 2002).
A typical nanopulse is fed into the GTEM cell and propagates virtually unperturbed to
the position of the sample. While the pulse generator output can be easily measured, the
electric ﬁeld in an exposure chamber in the vicinity and inside the sample is diﬃcult or
even impossible to measure. To ﬁnd the ﬁeld inside the sample it is necessary to consider
a computational approach consisting of numerical solution of Maxwell’s equations.

A computational approach requires a realistic description of the geometry and the
physical properties of exposed biological material, must be able to deal with a broadband
response, and be numerically robust and appropriate for the computer technology of
today. The numerical method based on the ﬁnite diﬀerence-time domain (FDTD)
method satisﬁes these conditions. This method is originally introduced by Kane Yee in
the 1960s (Yee 1966), but was extensively developed in the 1990s (Sadiku 1992, Kunz
and Luebbers 1993, Sullivan 2000, Taﬂove and Hagness 2000).

In the previous paper (Simicevic and Haynie 2005), we applied the FDTD method
to calculate the EM ﬁeld inside biological samples exposed to nanopulses in a GTEM
cell. While the physical properties of the environment were included in the calculation to
the fullest extent, we restricted ourselves to two-dimensional geometry in order to reduce
the computational time. In this paper we report the results of a full three-dimensional
calculation of the same problem. We will show that the essential features of the two-
dimensional solution, such as the importance of the rise time, remain, and that full
three-dimensional computation produces new results and reveals the complexity of the
EM ﬁelds inside the exposed sample. Since it is possible that the bioeﬀects of short EM
pulses are qualitatively diﬀerent from those of narrow-band radio frequencies, knowing

all the ﬁeld components inside the sample is essential for the development of a model
of the biological cell, cellular environment, and EM interaction mechanisms and their
eﬀects (Polk and Postow 1995).

2. Computational Inputs

The results presented in this paper are obtained using a full three-dimensional
calculation of the same FDTD computer code described in the previous work. This
code was validated by comparing the numerical and analytical solution of Maxwell’s
equations for a problem which had comparable geometrical and physical complexity to
the one being studied in this work (Simicevic and Haynie 2005). The key requirements
imposed on the code is that the space discretization of the geometry and description of
the physical properties are accurate in the high frequency domain associated with an
UWB pulse and appropriate for numerical simulation.

The computation consists of calculating EM ﬁelds inside the polystyrene cuvette,
shown in Figure 1, ﬁlled with biological material and exposed to UWB radiation. The
size of the cuvette is 1 cm

calculation, the material inside the cuvette was the same, blood or water.

in this paper it is useful to know the frequency spectrum of the pulse used, which we
plotted in Figure 2.

The shape of the cuvette and the sample inside was discretized by means of Yee
cells, cubes of edge length ∆x. The Yee cells had to be small enough not to distort the
shape and large enough for the time step, calculated from the Courant stability criterion
(Taﬂove and Brodwin 1975, Kunz and Luebbers 1993, Taﬂove and Hagness 2000)

to be practical for overall computation. In Equation 2, in our case, ∆x = ∆y = ∆z and
c is the speed of light in vacuum. In order for the computation to be appropriate for
the full frequency range of the EM pulse, the size of a Yee cell must also satisfy the rule

where v is the speed of light in the material and fmax is the highest frequency considered
deﬁned by the pulse rise time

In this equation fr is a maximum frequency in Hz and τr is a rise time in s (Faulkner
1969).

In the previous, as well as in the present work, the Yee cube edge length of
∆x = 1/4 mm satisﬁes all the above criteria and may be used to model blood exposure
to the wave frequency of up to 15 GHz, a much greater value than required by the

0.48 ps.
Optimal agreement between geometrical and physical descriptions eliminated the need
for additional approximations and resulted in about one hour of computational time for
every nanosecond of simulated time on a modern personal computer.

3. Dielectric Properties of Exposed Sample

Proper description of the dielectric properties of the exposed material is crucial when
dealing with an UWB electromagnetic pulse. EM properties of a biological material
are normally expressed in terms of
frequency-dependent dielectric properties and
conductivity, usually parametrized using the Cole-Cole model (Gabriel 1996, Gabriel
et al 1996):

ε(ω) = ε∞ +

where i = √
1, ε∞ is the permittivity in the terahertz frequency range, ∆εk are the
drops in permittivity in a speciﬁed frequency range, τk are the relaxation times, σ is the
ionic conductivity, and αk are the coeﬃcients of the Cole-Cole model. They constitute
up to 14 real parameters of a ﬁtting procedure. While this function can be numerically
Fourier transformed into the time domain, its application is problematic for FDTD. In
addition to the physical problems arising when the Cole-Cole parametrization is applied
(Simicevic and Haynie 2005), this parametrization requires time consuming numerical
integration techniques and makes computation unacceptably slow.

If instead of a Cole-Cole parametrization one uses the Debye model in which the
dielectric properties of a material are described as a sum of N independent ﬁrst-order
processes

χ(τ ) is the electric susceptibility of a material (Jackson 1999) and τk is the relaxation

The static conductivity, σ,

is deﬁned in the time domain as the constant of
proportionality between the current density and the applied electric ﬁeld, ~J = σ ~E, and
its implementation in FDTD does not require additional or diﬀerent Fourier transforms
(Kunz and Luebbers 1993).

The Debye parametrization allows use of a recursive convolution scheme (Luebbers
et al 1990, 1991, Luebbers and Hunsberger 1992) and makes FDTD computation an
order of magnitude faster compared to the use of numerical integration. In a recursive

convolution scheme the permittivity at time step (m + 1) is simply the permittivity at
time step m multiplied by a constant (Kunz and Luebbers 1993). In addition to making
the computation faster, in the previous work (Simicevic and Haynie 2005) we have
shown that the Debye model also provides a suﬃciently accurate description of physical
properties of some biological materials. Here we use the same Debye parameters used in
the previous two-dimensional calculation. The parameters applied in the Debye model

4. Field Calculation and Data Representation

FDTD calculations of the exposure of a biological material to EM nanopulses provide
the values of electric and magnetic ﬁeld components at every space point and throughout
the time range. In the case of a three-dimensional computation, there is overwhelming
information such that data reduction and representation of the results becomes a
nontrivial task. Contrary to radar applications where the interest is in scattered ﬁelds,
here we care about total ﬁelds inside and closely sourrounding the sample. Even in
such a restricted volume we have an immense number of data points and one has to
carefully select the region of interest and the information to collect. The extraction of
data depends on the physical model of interest and has to be decided prior to running
the FDTD program.

The FDTD method enables easy creation of animated movies, which are very useful
as a ﬁrst step in the analysis and understanding of the behavior of the EM ﬁelds in space
and time. The restriction of such visualization is that only parts of the full result can
be represented at any given time and only in a chosen region of interest, typically in a
few selected planes. As an example, snapshots of the penetration of an EM pulse into
the cuvette, shown in Figure 1, ﬁlled with blood to the height of 2 cm are shown in
Figure 3. The complete animation can be accessed on-line (Simicevic 2005).

5. Results

In the previous two-dimensional calculation we have shown that the penetration of a
linearly-polarized EM pulse described by Equation 1 into the blood-ﬁlled cuvette is
governed by the pulse rise-time, creates a sub-nanosecond pulse, and is absorbed into a
conductive loss of the material. While conﬁrming the same results, the three-dimensional
calculation also shows that the blood-ﬁlled cuvette behaves as a rectangular dielectric
resonator.

In general, if a dielectric object is immersed in a incident sinusoidal wave, the EM
ﬁelds in and around the object peak to high values at certain resonant frequencies.
The object has a property of a resonator. The properties of dielectric resonators,
such as resonant frequencies, ﬁeld patterns, and quality factors, are diﬃcult to obtain
analytically except for a simple shapes such as, for example, a sphere (Van Bladel
1975). The FDTD method in combination with other techniques, like Fourier analysis
or Prony’s method, can be used to determine the resonant frequencies and quality factors
of dielectric resonators numerically (Navarro et al 1991, Harms et al 1992, Pereda et al

Three-Dimensional FDTD Simulation of Biomaterial Exposure to Electromagnetic Nanopulses8

1992).

The resonant frequencies of a dielectric resonator depend on the size, shape and
dielectric properties of the resonator (Kajfez and Guillon 1986). Generally, they can
be found from the boundary condition at the surface between the resonator and the
surrounding medium (Balanis 1989, Jackson 1999). In the case of a rectangular cavity
resonator, a metal box, which can be ﬁlled with dielectric material, that traps the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, the resonant frequencies can be easily calculated using (Harrington
1961)

For a pure dielectric box the situation is more complicated. The ﬁeld is not
entirely conﬁned inside the box but it also exists as an evanescent wave outside the
box. This wave decays exponentially with the distance from the dielectric. In our case,
the complications arise also from the constant change of the exterior ﬁeld caused by the
incident pulse. The boundary conditions require that any tangential component of the
electric ﬁeld ~E be continuous, and that any normal component of electric displacement ~D
be discontinuous by the amount of the charge density on the surface. Also, any normal
component of the magnetic ﬂux density ~B has to be continuous, and any tangential
component of the magnetic ﬁeld ~H has to be discontinuous by the amount of the surface
current density. More detailed discussion of the boundary conditions and resonant
modes of the dielectric resonator can be found in the paper by R. K. Mongia and A.
Ittipiboon and references therein (Mongia and Ittipiboon 1997). Application of the
boundary conditions in the FDTD calculation is discussed in more details by P. Yang
et al (Yang et al 2004).

To ﬁnd out what is happening when a dielectric box is immersed in the
electromagnetic pulse, we have plotted the values of the x-component of the total ﬁeld,
Ex, for a selected time and in two planes:
in the horizontal X-Y plane across the
midpoint of the cuvette (left side of the Figure 4), and in the vertical X-Z plane across
the same point (right side of the Figure 4). As a result of the boundary conditions, in
both cases Ex is discontinuous at the wall normal to its direction. At the wall parallel
to the ﬁeld direction, Ex has to be continuous, but, since the outside ﬁeld has to be
continuous too, there is an abrupt change of the value of the Ex component along the
parallel wall, a change that is more prominent closer to the edges of the wall. While the
details of the ﬁeld behavior change from one time point to an other, the general feature
stays the same. It is important to notice the formation of a resonant wave inside the
dielectric on both sides of Figure 4.

It is not easy to estimate the resonant frequencies of a dielectric slab (Antar et

al 1998).
In the ﬁrst approximation, assuming that the exponential decay of the
evanescent wave with the distance from the slab is very fast, one can estimate the
resonant frequency using Equation 9. We have calculated the lowest resonant frequency
by selecting m = n = p = 1, which allows for all the components of the EM ﬁeld to
exist. In our case a = b = 0.95 cm and c = 2.0 cm. Since ε in Equation 9 is a function
of frequency described by the Debye model, the resonant frequency will be a function of
frequency, too. If the dielectric resonator were immersed in the plane wave, we would
expect the resonance to occur when the frequency of the wave is equal to the resonant
In Figure 5 this corresponds to the intersection of the line f111 = f and

calculated resonant frequencies. For water the expected resonant frequency was found
to be f111 = 2.66 GHz and for blood f111 = 2.94 GHz. As shown in Figure 2, those
frequencies are well inside the frequency spectrum of the double exponential pulse used
in this calculation, therefore one can expect the resonant excitation to occur.

To estimate the resonant frequencies using the FDTD data the ﬁeld values were

extracted at a ﬁxed observation point inside the dielectric resonator as function of time.
For any ﬁeld component those values can be expressed in the form of free damped
oscillator (Ko and Mittra 1991, Pereda et al 1992). Assuming just one resonant mode
and selecting the Ex component of the total ﬁeld one can write

Ex(t) = Ae−αt sin(2πfrt) + B,

where A is the modal amplitude, α is the damping factor, fr is the resonant frequency,
and B is small additional noise. The FDTD data ﬁtted with this function are shown in
Figure 6. The results of the ﬁt are tabulated in Table 2. The ratio B/A is less than
1%. Taking into consideration the simplicity of our model, the agreement between the
expected resonant freqency and the one obtained through the ﬁt is very good.

Knowing the resonant frequency and the damping factor, one can also obtain the

quality factor Q of the dielectric resonator using

Q = πfr/α.

The Q-factor is also tabulated in Table 2.

Finally, Figure 7 shows a few values of all the electric and magnetic ﬁeld components
in the blood and in the cuvette walls in the x-z plane during the pulse rise time. The
curves are separated in time by 20 ps. As expected, the Ex, Ez, and Hy are continuous
and Ey, Hx, and Hz are discontinuous at the boundaries of the materials. The buildup
of a resonant steady wave is also shown.

The full three-dimensional computation of the exposure of the blood-ﬁlled cuvette
to a linearly-polarized EM pulse described by Equation 1, not only reproduced the
results of the two-dimensional computation, but also gave an insight into properties of
induced components of the EM ﬁeld. The three-dimensional calculation supports the
notion that pulse penetration is a function of both rise time and pulse width, with both

and the penetration dominated by rise time in the case of a conductive material, left side
of Figure 1. It also shows that for a material of considerable conductivity, the incident
pulse width is relatively unimportant. In addition, the three-dimensional calculation
reveals that the dielectric box exposed to EM pulses behaves as a dielectric resonator.
FDTD approach also allows calculation of the energy deposited in a biological

the entire time and it is easy to perform numerical integration of Equation 12. The

6. Conclusion

In this paper we have extended our previous FDTD calculations on nanopulse
penetration into biological matter from two to three dimensions. Calculations included
the same detailed geometrical description of the material exposed to nanopulses, the
same accurate description of the physical properties of the material, the same spatial
resolution of 1/4 mm side length of the Yee cell, and the same cut-oﬀ frequency of
15 GHz in the dielectric. To minimize computation time,

The results of three-dimensional FDTD calculation can be summarized as follows:
a) The shape of a nanopulse inside a biomaterial is a function of both rise time
and width of the incident pulse, with the importance of the rise time increasing as the
conductivity of the material increases. Biological cells inside a conductive material are
exposed to pulses which are often substantially shorter than the duration of the incident
pulse. The same results followed from the two-dimensional calculation.

b) The dielectric material exposed to the EM pulse shows a behavior which can be
attributed to the properties of a dielectric resonator. This result could not have been
obtained by the two-dimensional calculation.

c) The amount of energy deposited by the pulse is small and no eﬀect observed

from exposure of a biological sample to nanopulses can have a thermal origin.

Calculation of the electric ﬁeld surrounding a biological cell is a necessary step
in understanding eﬀects resulting from exposure to nanopulses. We have developed
a complete FDTD code capable of this.
In the near future, through the Louisiana
Optical Network Initiative, we will have access to several supercomputers at Louisiana
universities connected into one virtual statewide supercomputer. We will soon be able to
calculate very complicated structures, larger size objects, and more complex materials.

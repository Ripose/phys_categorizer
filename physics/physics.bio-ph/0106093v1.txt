We introduce a model of molecular evolution in which the ﬁtness of an individual depends both
on its own and on the parent’s genotype. The model can be solved by means of a nonlinear mapping
onto the standard quasispecies model. The dependency on the parental genotypes cancels from
the mean ﬁtness, but not from the individual sequence concentrations. For ﬁnite populations, the
position of the error threshold is very sensitive to the inﬂuence from parent genotypes. In addition
to biological applications, our model is important for understanding the dynamics of self-replicating
computer programs.

Simple models of asexual evolution, such as the qua-
sispecies model, typically assume that the ﬁtness of an
organism is a function of only its genotype and the en-
vironment. This allows for the analysis of evolution
in static [1–7] or variable [8–10] environments, many
to one mappings from genotype to phenotype (neutral-
ity) [11–13], and phenotypic plasticity [14]. These models
disregard the potential inﬂuence of the mother (or parent,
in general) on the organism’s phenotype. This inﬂuence
comes about because in addition to the genetic material,
a wealth of proteins and other substances is transferred
from mother to child. In the context of sexual reproduc-
tion, the inﬂuence of the mother on a child’s phenotype is
usually called a maternal eﬀect. A classic example is that
of the snail Partula suturalis [15], for which the direc-
tionality in the coiling of the shells is determined by the
genotype of the mother of an organism, rather than the
organism’s own genotype. Maternal eﬀects are not ex-
clusive to sexually reproducing organisms, however, they
can be observed in simple asexual organisms as well. In
bacteria, for example, the ﬁtness of a strain in a given
environment may depend on the environment that was
experienced by the strain’s immediate ancestors [16,17].

Here, our objective is to deﬁne and study a model of
the evolution of asexual organisms that takes such ma-
ternal eﬀects into account. We assume that the ﬁtness
of an organism is given by the product of two quanti-
ties a and b, where a depends solely on the genotype of
the mother of the organism, and b depends solely on the
organism’s own genotype. Since we need to keep track
of the abundances of all possible mother/child combina-
tions, we need n2 concentration variables if we distinguish
n diﬀerent genotypes in our model. In the following, we
denote by xij the concentration of organisms of genotype
j descended from genotype i, and by qji the probability
that a genotype i mutates into genotype j. The time evo-
lution of the xij is then, in analogy to the quasispecies
model,

˙xij (t) =

akbiqjixki(t) − f (t)xij (t) ,

P

i,j aibjxij (t). The function f (t) gives the
with f (t) =
average ﬁtness of the population at time t. In principle,
this model can be solved by diagonalizing a n2 × n2 ma-
trix. However, since even for relatively short genetic se-
quences the number of possible genotypes n is enormous,
this direct method is very cumbersome. Fortunately, a
simple transformation exists that reduces the above prob-
lem to one in which the diagonalization of a n × n matrix
is suﬃcient. Namely, if we introduce variables xi such
that

xij = biqjixi

bkxk

,

(cid:17)

.(cid:16) Xk

then, after inserting Eq. (2) into Eq. (1), we obtain in
the steady state ( ˙xij = 0)

˜f xi =

ajbjqij xj

Xj

with ˜f =
j ajbjxj . The inverse transformation, which
converts Eq. (3) back into the right-hand-side of Eq. (1),
P
can be achieved with

xi =

ajxji

(cid:16) Xj

(cid:17).(cid:16) Xj,k

ajxjk

.

(cid:17)

Therefore, Eq. (3) is fully equivalent to the steady state
of Eq. (1). This leads to an interesting conclusion. Note
that Eq. (3) is simply the steady state equation of the
quasispecies model if we assume that genotypes j repli-
cate with replication rate cj = ajbj and mutate into geno-
types i with qij , while xi gives the relative concentration
of genotype i. Consequently, the model with maternal
eﬀects is mathematically equivalent to the standard qua-
sispecies model. Moreover, with the aid of Eq. (2) and
Eq. (4), it can be shown that f (t → ∞) = ˜f . Therefore,

the average ﬁtness in both models is the same; the ma-
ternal eﬀects drop out of the expression for the average
ﬁtness.

P

While the average ﬁtness depends only on the values
of ci, the individual sequence concentrations actually de-
pend on the details of the maternal eﬀects. In particu-
lar, the total amount of sequences of a given genotype
i is not identical to the corresponding value xi in the
j xji 6= xi in general).
standard quasispecies model (
From Eq. (2), we see that for every given mutation ma-
trix qij, we can suppress any sequence concentration to as
small a level as we please, by reducing the corresponding
bi and holding the other bj constant (limbi→0 xij = 0).
Enhancement of sequence concentrations is also possi-
ble, although there exists an upper bound that cannot
be exceeded. The upper bound is given by the matrix
element qji (limbi→∞ xij = qji). Its existence is easy to
understand: by changing bi, we can only jointly manip-
ulate the concentrations of all sequences descended from
genotype i. The ratio between diﬀerent genotypes j de-
scended from i is always ﬁxed, and it is determined by
the matrix elements qji. At most, the sum over all de-
scendants from all genotypes i in the population can be
one,

j xij = 1, which implies xij = qji.

P

We will now classify the diﬀerent types of maternal ef-
fects. If all ai = 1, such that bi = ci, no maternal eﬀects
are present, and we obtain the normal sequence concen-
trations from the quasispecies model. We will refer to
this situation as the neutral case.
In order to classify
all non-neutral situations, we compare concentrations of
those sequences that are true copies of their parents (this
is the only reasonable way, given that all genotypes de-
scended from the same ancestor i scale identically with
bi).
If the concentration xii of a sequence with large
ci is reduced, while the concentration xjj of some other
sequence with smaller cj is enhanced, we will speak of
positive maternal eﬀects. Likewise, if the sequence con-
centration of a faster replicating sequence is enhanced,
at the expense of some slower replicating sequence, we
will speak of negative maternal eﬀects. In short, positive
maternal eﬀects promote slower replicators, and negative
maternal eﬀects promote faster replicators. We refer to
the above classiﬁcation as the direction of the maternal
eﬀects. Likewise, the strengh of the maternal eﬀects in-
dicates the degree to which a system deviates from the
neutral case (weak maternal eﬀects show only a small
deviation, strong maternal eﬀects show a large deviation
from the neutral case).

With Eq. (2) we can solve the model, as long as
there exists an analytical solution for the corresponding
quasispecies landscape. This means that solutions for
multiplicative landscapes [18,19], the single peak land-
scape [20], and certain spin-glass landscapes [21–23] are
readily available. In the following, we discuss the well-
known example of the sharp single-peak landscape [24].
We assume that the genetic sequences are binary of

length ℓ. Moreover, we assume a uniform copy ﬁdelity
q per digit. The sequence 000 . . . 0 may replicate (in the
absence of mutations) with rate c0 = a0b0. We will refer
to this sequence as the master sequence. Let all other
sequences replicate with c1 = a1b1 ≪ c0. If ℓ is large, we
may neglect back-mutations onto the master sequence, in
which case it is suﬃcient to keep track of the total concen-
tration of all sequences oﬀ the peak in a single variable,
x1. The mutation matrix qij is then a 2 × 2 matrix with
the elements q00 = qℓ, q10 = 1 − qℓ, q01 = q10/(2ℓ − 1),
and q11 = 1 − q01 (the elements q01 and q01 are approx-
imated). In the standard quasispecies model, the equi-
librium concentration of the master sequence x0 is given
by

x0 = (c0q00 − c1)/(c0 − c1) ,

and x1 likewise as x1 = 1−x0. The average ﬁtness follows
as

Now, for the sequence concentrations with maternal ef-
fects, we obtain from Eq. (5) in conjunction with Eq. (2)

f =

c0q00

x0i = b0qi0(c0q00 − c1)/Λ ,

with Λ = (b0 − b1)c0q00 + b1c0 − b0c1 and i = 0, 1.

Figure 1 displays the four sequence concentrations x00,
x01, x10, x11 of the above deﬁned landscape, for positive,
negative, and neutral maternal eﬀects. We see that in-
deed the maternal eﬀects result in a signiﬁcant shift in the
sequence concentrations. The concentration x11 (shown
in the lower right of Fig. 1), e.g., encompasses almost
the complete population for positive maternal eﬀects at
an error rate of about 0.04, while it constitutes less than
20% in the case of the negative maternal eﬀects for the
same error rate.

The potential shift in the individual sequence con-
centrations has important implications for ﬁnite popu-
lations. When the concentration of a sequence (as pre-
dicted for an inﬁnite population) approaches the inverse
of the population size, that sequence will most certanily
be lost through sampling ﬂuctuations. In the case of the
master sequence, this eﬀect is responsible for the shift of
the error catastrophe towards smaller error rates for ﬁnite
populations in the ordinary quasispecies model [25–28].
Now, since the concentration of the master sequence can
be made arbitrarily small with suitable maternal eﬀects,
it follows that the error threshold can be shifted. This
eﬀect is illustrated in Fig. 2 for a population size of
N = 1000, for which the error transition in the nor-
mal quasispecies model (as represented by the ’neutral’
case) is already signiﬁcantly shifted. Positive maternal
eﬀects increase this shift by a fair amount, while nega-
tive maternal eﬀects can almost completely counteract

2

the ﬁnite population eﬀect, and move the error transi-
tion very close to the inﬁnite population limit. Besides
the shift in the error transition, Fig. 2 shows that the
average ﬁtness is indeed unaﬀected by strength and/or
direction of the maternal eﬀects, as all three curves lie
exactly on the inﬁnite population result for error rates
below the respective error transitions.

We have seen above that the mean ﬁtness in the pop-
ulation is not inﬂuenced by the existence of maternal
eﬀects.
Since selection acts only on the average ﬁt-
ness [29,30], it follows that the maternal eﬀects cannot be
under selective pressure. In order to verify this, we have
performed simulations in which strength and direction
of the maternal eﬀects were allowed to evolve. To each
sequence in the population, we added an inheritable vari-
able z. On reproduction, the oﬀspring received a value
z′ = z + dz, where dz was a normally distributed random
variable. For the master sequence, z was then mapped
into a0 and b0 via a0 = (α+z)/α for z > 0, a0 = α/(α+z)
for z ≤ 0, and b0 = 1/a0, with α deﬁning the scale be-
tween z and a0, b0. For a1 and b1, the value of z was ig-
nored. Figure 3 shows a typical simulation run in such a
system. We chose N = 1000 and 1 − q = 0.06, so that the
population was below the error threshold in the absence
of maternal eﬀects, and we initialized all sequences in the
population to z = 0. Over the course of a simulation, the
z values drift randomly, which can be seen in increasing
and diminishing ﬂuctuations about the average ﬁtness.
When the average z drifts below zero, the ﬂuctuations
decrease, because z < 0 corresponds to negative mater-
nal eﬀects, which shift the population away from the error
threshold. When the average z drifts above zero, on the
other hand, the ﬂuctuations increase. If there is no upper
limit to z, the ﬂuctuations will eventually grow so large
that the population is pushed over the error threshold.
In Fig. 3, this happend around generation 5400.

The model we have introduced in this paper oversim-
pliﬁes the situation for bacteria, where substances can
remain in the cytoplasm for several generations, such
that not only the parent, but also the grand- and the
grand-grand-parent etc. have an inﬂuence on the pheno-
type of an individual. However, it is an exact description
of the dynamics of the digital organisms (self-replicating
and evolving computer programs) of the Avida system,
which has been used extensively in experimental evolu-
tion research [30–35]. The replication rate of these digital
organisms is the ratio between the number of instruc-
tions per unit time that they can execute [the speed of
their central processing unit (CPU)] and the number of
instructions they have to execute in order to produce a
new oﬀspring (length of the gestation cycle). The CPU
speed depends on the number and type of logical oper-
ations that these organisms perform in addition to their
replicatory activity (the more logical operations an or-
ganism performs, the faster its CPU will operate). Since
the logical operations an organism can perform are only

known a posteriori, these organisms obtain their initial
CPU speed from their parent organism. The CPU speed
corresponds thus to the parameter a of the present work,
and the length of the gestation cycle to the inverse of the
parameter b. Therefore, we have shown in that a qua-
sispecies description of the digital organisms is indeed
justiﬁed, as was proposed in [30]. Also, our model might
lead to a detailed quantitative description of the dynam-
ics of digital organisms in future work.

ABSTRACT. In serine proteases (SP’s), the H-bond between

His-57 and Asp-102, and that between Gly-193 and the transition

state intermediate play a crucial role for enzymatic function. To

shed light on the nature of these interactions, we have carried out

ab initio molecular dynamics simulations on complexes represent-

ing adducts between the reaction intermediate and elastase (one

protein belonging to the SP family). Our calculations indicate the

presence of a low–barrier H-bond between His-57 and Asp-102, in

complete agreement with NMR experiments on enzyme–transition

state analog complexes [1]. Comparison with an ab initio molecular

dynamics simulation on a model of the substrate–enzyme adduct

indicates that the Gly-193–induced strong stabilization of the in-

termediate is accomplished by charge/dipole interactions and not

by H-bonding as previously suggested.

Inclusion of the protein

electric ﬁeld in the calculations does not aﬀect signiﬁcantly the

charge distribution.

INTRODUCTION

Hydrogen bonding is one of the most important interactions for the bi-

ological function of enzymes. Extensive H-bond networks may stabilize the

conformation of the active site which is necessary for the catalytic function

and they can ﬁx the optimal orientation of the substrate for the enzymatic

reaction. Most importantly, H-bonds may allow for transition state stabi-

lization by lowering the activation free energy by several kcal/mol [2, 3].

A typical example in this respect is constituted by serine proteases (SP’s)

enzyme family[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

SP’s use the catalytic triad (Ser-195–His-57–Asp-102) to catalyze the hy-

drolysis of peptides (Fig. 1a). This occurs through nucleophilic addition of

the 3-hydroxyl group of Ser-195 to the acyl carbonyl of the substrate, with

formation of a negatively charged tetrahedral intermediate (Fig. 1b).

Stabilization of the intermediate is achieved by formation of two H-bond

with the amide groups of Ser-195 and Gly-193 (mammalian isoenzymes[4])

or with the amide groups of Ser-195 and the sidechain of Asn-155 (bacterial

isoenzymes[14]).

Theoretical[15, 16] and experimental[14, 17] studies on wild type and

mutants of a bacterial SP (subtilisin) have shown that Asn-155 is a key

residue for the biological function, in that it provides a stabilization of the

transition state (TS) relative to the ground state (GS) by as much as ≈ 5

kcal/mol. Curiously, no correspondent studies on the mammalian isoenzymes

have appeared to shed light on the crucial role of Gly-193[18].

A second, important H-bond interaction involve two residues of the cat-

alytic triad, His-57 and Asp-102. A series of NMR studies on a mammalian[1,

3

11, 12, 13] and bacterial[20] SP’s and their complexes with inhibitors have

indicated the presence of a low–barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) linking Nδ1

of protonated His-57 with the β carboxyl group of Asp-102 (Fig. 1b)[1, 11,

12, 13]. Approaching of the TS is suggested to facilitate the formation of the

LBHB, which in turn may render Nǫ2 of His-57 a stronger base for accepting

a proton from Ser-195 in the formation of the intermediate[1, 11, 12, 13].

As result of this process, the free energy barrier of TS relative to GS de-

creases. Ab initio calculations and neutron scattering experiments have led

to the conclusion that the LBHB is very covalent in nature[21]. Thus, this

“resonance–stabilization” energy could supply much of the energy necessary

for enzyme’s catalysis[1, 11, 12, 13]. However, the role of this LBHB for the

catalytic power of SP’s is object of controversy[22, 23].

From the above considerations it is clear that, in spite of its crucial role,

the nature and the dynamics of hydrogen bonding in active site of SP are not

fully understood. In order to provide a picture of the chemical bonding of

these interactions in SP’s, and to relate it to the biological function, we have

carried out ab initio molecular dynamics simulations [24] on models of SP–

intermediate and SP–substrate complexes. This technique is revealing itself

as a useful computational tool for investigating speciﬁc molecular interactions

in biological systems [25]. Based on state–of–the art density functional theory

calculations, it describes interactions and charge distributions of (relatively)

large systems rather accurately. Furthermore, it includes temperature eﬀects,

which obviously play a fundamental role in SP function. Finally, they allow

describing bond breaking and bond forming processes at room temperature,

which is essential to describe phenomena such as the LBHB.

4

Anticipating our results, the calculations show that the LBHB is a strongly

covalent interaction and that the dramatic Gly-193–induced stabilization of

the reaction intermediate is due mainly to the electrostatic interactions be-

tween the intermediate and the Asn-192–Gly-193 peptide’s unit dipole.

COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE

Model complexes.

Our structural models for the adducts of SP with intermediate (I·SP) and

substrate (S·SP) are based on the X-ray structure of porcine pancreatic ela-

stase (240 residues) complexed with Ace-Ala-Pro-Val-diﬂuoro-N-phenylethylacetamide

(PDB entry: 4EST) [26, 19]. They include the entire catalytic triad, the scis-

sile peptide bond and the oxyanion hole.

The construction of the complexes is carried out in several steps: i) the

terminal N-phenylethylacetamide is replaced by an acetyl group; ii) all hy-

drogen atoms of the complex, not present in the X-ray structure, are added

assuming standard bond lengths and bond angles;

iii) a shell of 1453 water

molecules including the crystallographic ones (approximatively correspond-

ing to three water monolayers), is added; iv) four chlorine counter ions are

added to ensure neutrality; v) energy minimization is carried out with the

AMBER suite of programs [27] using the AMBER force ﬁeld [28] (conver-

gence criterion 0.0001 kcal/(mol·˚A)). In the minimization, no periodic bound-

ary condition are applied and the electrostatic interactions are calculated

assuming a constant dielectric function ǫ = 1 and without cutoﬀ.

5

The I·SP and S·SP model complexes comprises the entire side-chain of

Asp-102, the imidazole ring of His-57, the Q192G193 peptide linkage and

the entire Ser-195 residue, which in I·SP is covalently bound to the substrate

(Fig. 2a,b). His-57 is considered doubly protonated in I·SP and protonated

in the δ position in S·SP [29].

Alternative models representing I·SP and S·SP diﬀer from the previous

ones for the substitution of the Q192G193 peptide link with dimethylammo-

nia (Fig. 2c,d).

Calculations.

The quantum–mechanical problem is solved within the framework of den-

sity functional theory (DFT)[30], in its Kohn and Sham (KS)[31] formulation.

The KS orbitals are expanded in a plane–wave basis set, up to an energy

cut–oﬀ of 70 Ry. Only valence electrons are considered explicitly, pseudopo-

tentials of the Martins and Troullier [32] being used for the core–valence

electron interaction. BLYP[33, 34] gradient–corrected exchange–correlation

functionals are used. The charge of all the complexes is -1.

We have carried out geometry optimization using the direct inversion in

iterative subspace (DIIS) method [35, 36] for both electronic (convergence

threshold set to 10−5) and ionic degrees of freedom (convergence threshold

set to 5 · 10−4).

DFT–based Car–Parrinello ab initio molecular dynamics simulations [24]

are performed at constant temperature, with the atomic trajectories col-

lected over a period of 0.6 and 1.0 ps for S·SP and I·SP, respectively. Equa-

6

tions of motion are integrated with the velocity Verlet algorithm. The ﬁcti-

tious electron mass is 400 a.u. and the integration timestep is 4 a.u. Con-

stant temperature simulations are achieved by coupling the systems to a

Nos´e thermostat[37] at T = 300 K with a frequency of 500 cm−1. The ter-

minal hydrogens of Asp-102, His-57, and Gly-193, corresponding to the Cα,

Cβ and Cα respectively, are kept ﬁxed in their starting position; in S·SP an

additional constraint between the Oγ(Ser-195) and the substrate carbon of

the scissile bond (indicated in Fig. 2b as CS) is imposed.

Calculations including the external electrostatic potential of the whole

protein–water system are also carried out. This potential Φprot(r) at the

point r is evaluated as

Φprot(r) = X
i

qi
|ri − r|

where qi are the RESP [38] atomic point charges at point ri.

All Car–Parrinello calculations are performed with a parallel version of

the CPMD code V3.0h [39].

Calculated properties.

The electrostatic energy ∆E between to moieties (e.g. the intermediate

and Q192G193 peptide unit) is calculated as

where the indexes i and j refer to atoms of the two moieties. qi and qj are

the partial atomic ESP charges[40] and rij is the interatomic distance.

Test calculations are carried out also using the multipolar expansion of

the electrostatic energy up to the dipolar term:

RESULTS

In this section, ﬁrst we analyze structural and electronic features of two

models representing the adduct between serine protease and the reaction

intermediate (I and III of Fig. 2). Comparison is then made with features

of models of the substrate–enzyme complex (II and IV of Fig. 2).

The Intermediate–Enzyme complex

Structural features and charge distribution. Conformational properties

as well as the H-bond network of the complex are fairly maintained dur-

ing the dynamics (Fig. 3). Consequently, the charge distribution does not

change signiﬁcantly (with exception of CS and NS), as indicated by the ESP

atomic partial charges reported for several snapshots of the molecular dy-

8

namics (Tab. 1). Note that the CS–O bond of the intermediate is very

polarized towards the oxygen, consistently with the fact that this bond is

to be broken in the subsequent step of the hydrolysis. The presence of the

protein ﬁeld does not aﬀect signiﬁcantly the charge distribution (Tab. 2),

suggesting that solvent eﬀects do not play a major role for the electrostatic

interaction at the active site.

H-bond pattern: Asp-102–His-57. During the dynamics, proton hopping

occurs between the His-57 and Asp-102 in the subps time–scale (Fig. 4).

The presence of a LBHB is completely consistent with NMR data on an

intermediate–serine protease complex, namely the peptidyl triﬂuoromethyl

ketone–chymotrypsin adduct [1].

The chemical bonding of the LBHB can be characterized with the electron

localization function (ELF) [41, 42, 43]. The ELF has proven to be very useful

to illustrate chemical concepts like localized bonds and electron lone pairs.

Fig. 5 shows the ELF before, during and after the proton transfer from His-

57 to Asp-102. The red areas indicate strong localization, i.e. spatial regions

where the Pauli principle has little inﬂuence on the electron distribution.

Fig. 5a shows the presence of the lone pairs of the aspartate oxygen and

of the strong electron localization along the histidine Nδ1–H bond, which

indicates the covalent nature of the bond. During the proton transfer (Fig.

5b), the Nδ1–H bond is still very covalent and an incipient covalent Oδ2–H

bond is being formed. Protonation of Asp-102 establishes a covalent O–H

bond: signiﬁcant portion of ELF is indeed localized on the H atom (Fig. 5c).

The formation of the nitrogen electron lone–pair is also evident from the

picture. We conclude that the bonding in this LBHB is essentially covalent

9

in nature. Similar ﬁndings have been reported in a very recent ab initio study

of low–barrier H-bonds in an organic molecule [21].

H-bond pattern: Gly-193–intermediate. The second fundamental H-bond

interaction investigated here involves Gly-193 and the intermediate carbonyl

oxygen. This H-bond is well maintained during the dynamics (average O· · ·H

distance of 1.7(0.1) ˚A). A rough estimation of the interaction energy based

on an electrostatic model (see Computational Section) indicate that Gly–193

stabilizes the intermediate by more than 10 kcal/mol (Tab. 3). This value

appears to be too large for a purely electrostatic H-bond interaction [44, 45].

Inspection of the structure reveals that the very large Q192G193 peptide’s

unit dipole (≈ 4 D [6]) could be also an important factor for intermediate

stabilization, as it points towards the negative charge of the intermediate. To

extract the peptide dipolar contribution from the total stabilization energy

we construct a second model complex in which the Q192G193 peptide unit

is substituted by dimethylammonia (III in Fig. 2c). Tab. 3 shows that

the resulting stabilization is much smaller, only few kcal/mol. Thus, we

conclude that a large contribution of the transition state stabilization is due

to electrostatic interaction (charge–dipole interactions).

To study the relevance of the Q192G193 dipole on the dynamics, an ab

initio molecular dynamics simulation on complex III, where the Q192G193

peptide unit is replaced by a dimethylammonia, is performed. Fig. 6, which

reports structural properties of the complex, indicate that this complex is

very unstable with respect to the substrate–enzyme complex. Indeed, while

the key Gly-193–intermediate H-bond becomes very weak(Fig. 6a), the proto-

nated His-57 transfers a proton to the intermediate (Fig. 6a) and the Oγ(Ser-

10

195)–CS bond of the intermediate breaks. As a result, a double CS–O(I) bond

is formed (as indicated by the decrease of the bond distance up to the typi-

cal value of a carbonyl peptide bond (1.25 ˚A in Fig. 6b)) and CS changes it

hybridization from sp3 to sp2, with formation of the planar peptide unit (as

shown by the increase of the ∠(N(I)–CS–O(I)) angle up to ≈ 120o (Fig. 6c)).

In conclusion, our calculations suggest that the absence of the stabilizing

Q192G193 dipole causes the reverse of the reaction, with formation of the

substrate and the original H-bond pattern of the catalytic triad.

The Substrate–enzyme complex

Gln-192–substrate interactions. To estimate the stabilization of the Q192G193

peptide unit’s dipole on the substrate, we perform an ab initio molecular dy-

namics simulation of a model of the enzyme–substrate adduct (II in Fig. 2b).

Fig. 7 shows that during the dynamics the two key H-bond interactions

are maintained but no proton transfer occurs. Interestingly, the substrate–

protein interaction energy turns out to be much lower than that of the I·SP

complex (Tab. 3). Replacing the Q192G19 peptide with dimethylammonia

(complex IV) causes a drastic decrease of the interaction energy. The latter

turns out to be practically identical to that of complex III (Tab. 3). We

conclude that the H-bond interaction are similar in the S·SP and I·SP com-

plexes.

In contrast, the electrostatic (charge–dipole) interactions are very

diﬀerent, the I·SP being more stable by ≈ 6 kcal/mol than S·SP (Tab. 3).

It is interesting to note that this value compares well with previous quan-

tum mechanical calculations for the Asn-155–TS stabilization in the bacterial

11

isoenzyme[15, 16]. We conclude that the transition state stabilization is due

mostly to charge–dipole interactions.

For these complexes it has been possible to calculate also the binding en-

ergies. Tab. 3 shows a qualitative agreement between binding energies and

energies based on electrostatic model. This validates the use of the electro-

static model for a qualitative analysis of intermolecular interactions, as it has

been done in this work. However, it must be stressed that use of more real-

istic quantum mechanical models, which comprises other aminoacids present

in the active site cavity, is expected to screen the charges and therefore to

reduce the calculated binding energies.

Charge Distribution. Also in this complex, most of the ESP charges do

not vary signiﬁcantly during the dynamics and by introducing the electric

ﬁeld of the protein (Tabs. 4 and 5). Most of the ESP charges turn out to be

similar to those of the I·SP complex. A notable exception is represented by

the C–O peptide bond, which in this case is much less polarized toward the

oxygen. Thus it appears that the protein active site, and in particular the

Q192G193 moiety, is engineered so as to render the scissile bond more polar

in the formation of the transition state.

Within the very short time–scale here explored, our ab initio molecular

DISCUSSION

12

dynamics simulations help elucidate important aspects of two key interac-

tions in serine proteases–reaction intermediate complexes, the His-57–Asp-

102 LBHB and the Gly-193–intermediate H-bonds.

Our calculations are completely consistent with and conﬁrm the exis-

tence of a LBHB between His-57 and Asp-102, which has been observed

experimentally in transition state analog inhibitor complexes[1, 11, 12, 13].

Furthermore, they strongly support the proposal of an LBHB–facilitated

mechanism[1]. Indeed, the LBHB turns out to be mostly covalent in nature.

The energy supplied by covalent interaction may be crucial to overcome the

energy loss due to the compression of the two residues, which is a prerequisite

of the postulated LBHB–based reaction[1].

The second conclusion of this paper is that the rather large, Gly-193–

induced stabilization of the transition state with respect to the fundamental

state is not caused by an H-bond with Gly-193, as commonly proposed[4, 5]:

indeed, as the H-bond favors the binding of both substrate and intermediate

by ≈ 2.6 kcal/mol, a value typical of a strong H-bonds in biological sys-

tems [45]. Instead, the negatively charged transition state turns out to be

more stable relative to S·SP by several kcal/mol as a result of the interaction

of the negative charge with the large dipole of the Q192G193 peptide unit. A

simulation in which dimethylammonia replaces the Q192G193 peptide unit

conﬁrms the crucial role of the dipole: the absence of the stabilizing charge–

dipole interaction renders the intermediate species unstable. These consider-

ations suggest that site–directed mutagenesis experiments on the 192 and/or

193 positions might aﬀect signiﬁcantly the activity of SP’s, as the Q192G193

dipole orientation may be not optimal for transition state stabilization.

13

Because environment eﬀects may be very important for the chemistry

of the active site of this and other enzymes [15, 16, 44, 46], we carry out

some of the calculations in the presence of the electric ﬁeld of the protein.

Our results, summarized by tables 1–2 and 4–5, indicate however that the

ﬁeld appears not to aﬀect dramatically the charge distribution of the I·SP

and S·SP complexes. More sophisticated models of the protein electric ﬁeld,

which for instance include the electronic polarizabilities of the protein atoms,

are not expected to alter signiﬁcantly the picture.

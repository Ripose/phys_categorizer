We present a model of the infection of Hantavirus in deer mouse, Peromyscus maniculatus, based
on biological observations of the system in the North American Southwest. The results of the analysis
shed light on relevant observations of the biological system, such as the sporadical disappearance
of the infection, and the existence of foci or “refugia” that perform as reservoirs of the virus when
environmental conditions are less than optimal.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Hantaviruses are infectious agents carried by rodents
throughout the whole world [1, 2, 3]. Some of them
are able to cause severe disease in humans, with a mor-
tality rate of around 50%, as in the case of the Han-
tavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) caused by the Sin
Nombre Virus in the North American Southwest, or the
Andes Virus in Patagonia. With few exceptions, each
hantavirus is associated with a single primary rodent
host species, chronically infected, and infects humans
that come into contact with it or its excreta. Sin Nom-
bre Virus is primarily carried by the deer mouse, Per-
omyscus maniculatus, the most numerous mammal in
North America, prevalent throughout the region. It was
the cause of an outbreak of fatal pulmonary disease in the
Southwest of the United States in 1993, when the virus
was ﬁrst isolated and described. Since then, a great ef-
fort has been devoted to understand the nature of the
virus reservoir, its temporal and spatial dynamics, and
its relation to the human population, in an attempt to
ultimately identify and predict the risk of the disease.

Needless to say, a complete mathematical description
of the dynamics of the biological system, comprising the
virus, the mice, the humans and the environment, is a
daunting task. The goal of the present investigation is
much less ambitious. From the biological complexities
we extract a few major components centered on the basic
ecological and epidemiological features of the mice pop-
ulation. As the motivation for our analysis we choose
two observed characteristics of the disease. Both arise
from the fact that environmental conditions strongly af-
fect the dynamics and persistence of the infection. One
of them, a temporal characteristic, is the reported obser-
vation that the infection can completely disappear from a
population of mice if environmental conditions are inad-
equate, only to reappear sporadically or when conditions
change [3, 4, 5]. The other, a spatial characteristic, is

that there are indications of “focality” of the infection in
“reservoir” populations [3, 6]; as environmental changes
occur, these “refugia” [7] of the reservoir can expand or
contract, carrying the infection to other places.

The model we introduce incorporates the decay by
death of the mice population, the spread of the infec-
tion through their interaction, the increase by birth and
eﬀect of the environment to stabilize the population, and
also their movement as a process of diﬀusion. We be-
gin in Section II by ﬁrst omitting the last feature (the
movement from one location to another), motivating the
diﬀerent dynamical mechanisms, and obtaining some ba-
sic results including the observed temporal behavior. We
proceed in Section III to perform a spatial extension of
the model to include movement and obtain results re-
lating to the refugia. A summary is given in the ﬁnal
section.

II. BASIC MODEL OF MOUSE POPULATION

We can incorporate the basic ingredients of the biolog-
ical system in a model of the mouse population only [8].
We suppose that the whole population is composed of
two classes of mice, susceptible and infected, represented
by MS and MI respectively. Sex and age composition of
the population are disregarded in this basic model. The
temporal evolution of MS and MI contains two basic in-
gredients: the contagion of the infection, that converts
susceptible into infected, and a population dynamics in-
dependent of the infection:

dMS
dt
dMI
dt

= b M − cMS −

− a MSMI ,

(1)

MSM
K

+ a MSMI ,

= −c MI −

MI M
K
where MS and MI are the populations (or densities) of
susceptible and infected mice, respectively, and M (t) =
MS(t) + MI (t) is the total population of mice. The mo-
tivation for the terms in Eqs. (1,2) follows.

(2)

Births: b M represents births of mice, all of them born
susceptible, at a rate proportional to the total density,
since all mice contribute equally to the procreation [3].

Deaths: c represents the rate of depletion by death
for natural reasons, proportional to the corresponding
density. If necessary, separate rates cS and cI could be
introduced for the susceptible and infected populations
respectively.

Competition: −MS,IM/K represent a limitation pro-
cess in the population growth, due to competition for
shared resources. Each is proportional to the probabil-
ity of an encounter of a pair formed by one mouse of
the corresponding class, susceptible or infected, and one
mouse of any class (since every mouse, either susceptible
or infected, has to compete with the whole population).
K is a “carrying capacity,” characterizing in a simpliﬁed
way the capacity of the medium to maintain a population
of mice. Higher values of carrying capacity represent a
higher availability of water, food, shelter and other re-
sources that mice can use to thrive [9].

Infection: aMI MS represents the number of suscepti-
ble mice that get infected, due to an encounter with an
infected (and consequently infectious) mouse, at a rate a
that we assume constant. More elaborate models could
incorporate a density dependence on a, for example due
to an increased frequency of ﬁghts, during which conta-
gion occurs through bites, when the density is too high
and the population feels overcrowded [4]. The infection is
chronic, infected mice do not die of it, and infected mice
do not lose there infectiousness probably for their whole
life [3, 6]. For these reasons, this single term adequately
describes the infection dynamics of the two subpopula-
tions.

The sum of the two equations (1,2) reduces to a single

equation for the whole population of logistic form:

dM
dt

= (b − c)M

1 −

(3)

M
(b − c) K

.

(cid:18)
Logistic growth has been observed in laboratory pop-
ulations of Peromyscus [10], and is a well established
metaphor of the dynamics of a self limitating popula-
tion [9].

(cid:19)

There are four parameters that characterize the system
(1,2), viz. a, b, c and K. Of these, we will choose K as
a control parameter of the dynamics, since it is the one
that best represents the inﬂuence of the environment.

The system (1,2) has four equilibria. Two of them are
irrelevant to the present analysis (the null state, which
is always unstable, and a state with MI < 0 for any
parameters). The other two equilibria interchange their
stability character at a critical value of the carrying ca-
pacity, a result that we show in Fig. 1 as a bifurcation
diagram. The critical value of the carrying capacity is

Kc =

1
a

b
b − c

.

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

We can see that the prevalence of the infection can
be correlated, through K, with the diversity of habi-
tats and other ecological conditions. Thus, a scarcity
of resources—that is to say, a low value of K—is accom-
panied by a lower number of infected mice, as found in

ﬁeld studies such as [3, 6, 11]. Moreover, for values of K
below the threshold Kc the number of infected animals is
eﬀectively zero, a fact that has also been observed in the
ﬁeld (see for example [3, 4, 5]). That is, if temporarily the
ecological conditions at a place in the landscape get ad-
verse for the mice (because of a drought, for example) the
infection can drop to zero. Correspondingly, when condi-
tions improve again the infection reappears. The density
of infected mice can even display a dramatic increase with
respect to previous years, if a rare climatic event such as
El Ni˜no Southern Oscillation brings enhanced precipita-
tion and the consequent increase in edible resources for
the mice. An El Ni˜no event in 1991-1992, precisely, pre-
ceded the outbreak of HPS in 1993 in the Southwest [12].
Figure 2 shows a simulation of such events, within the
context of the present model. A time-dependent carrying
capacity is shown in Fig. 2 (top), and the corresponding
values of the susceptible and infected mice populations,
MS(t) and MI (t) respectively, are displayed in Fig. 2
(bottom). We model the carrying capacity with a yearly
sinusoidal behavior to emulate seasonal variations. A
period of 20 years is shown, during which the carrying
capacity oscillates around a value, sometimes above Kc
(shown as a horizontal line), sometimes below it. Dis-
continuities in the carrying capacity, some of which are
present in Fig. 2 (top), do not necessarily occur in nature,
and appear here because we keep the modeling of K(t) at
an elementary level, to illustrate the main features of the
system. The period marked “a” in Fig. 2 (from years 6
to 8) is characterized by values of K below Kc, and cor-
responds to very adverse environmental conditions. Dur-
ing these “bad years” the infection level eﬀectively drops
to zero, while the population of healthy mice, even if re-
duced, subsists. A return to “normal” carrying capacities
after year 8 produces a very slow recovery of the infected
population, which attains again appreciable values after
year 11. An extraordinary event on year 17 is marked as

“b” in Fig. 2. It corresponds to an increase in the car-
rying capacity (top), perhaps following an event such as
El Ni˜no the year before. These improved environmental
conditions are followed by an immediate (if moderate)
increase in the population of susceptible mice (bottom,
dotted line), and by a slightly delayed outbreak of in-
fection (bottom, full line). An event such as this would
appreciably increase the risk for the human population
to become infected.

III. SPATIALLY EXTENDED MODEL

The range of the deer mice is wide, comprising a di-
verse landscape with a variety of habitats. This spatial
extension and the inhomogeneous way in which it aﬀects
local populations can be included in a spatially extended
version of the model, where MS, MI and K become func-
tions of a space variable x. Diﬀusive movement of the
mice provide an adequate mechanism of transport, since
mice of the genus Peromyscus are known to hold a home
range during most of their adult life, occasionally shift-
ing it to nearby locations, in particular if these are va-
cant [13, 14]. In principle, diﬀerent diﬀusion coeﬃcients
should be used for susceptible and infected mice. The
observation that juvenile animals are the most mobile [4]
and that the infection aﬀects mainly adult males [2] cer-
tainly supports this. We will choose later, however, for
the sake of simplicity of the model, to keep both diﬀusiv-
ities equal. The extended model can be written as:

∂MS
∂t

= f (MS, MI ) + DS∇2MS,

(5)

Suppose that M ∗

I (x) are stationary solu-
tions of Eqs. (5,6), i.e. they are solutions of a Laplace
equation with nonlinear, space-dependent sources:

S(x) and M ∗

∇2MS = −f (MS, MI)/DS,
∇2MI = −g(MS, MI)/DI ,

found by setting the time derivative of Eqs. (5,6) equal
to zero. A perturbation around this equilibrium can be
written as:

MS(x, t) = M ∗
MI (x, t) = M ∗

S(x) + uS(x, t),
I (x) + uI(x, t).

When the two-component vector u = (uS, uI) describing
the perturbation is inserted into the diﬀerential equa-
tions (5,6), a linearization around the equilibrium solu-
tions yields

∂u(x, t)
∂t

= A(x) u(x, t) + D∇2u(x, t),

(11)

where A(x) is the linearization of the nonlinear terms of
Eqs. (5,6) around the equilibrium, viz.,

A(x) =

∂f
∂MS
∂g
∂MS

"

∂f
∂MI
∂g
∂MI #{M ∗

S ,M ∗
I }

,

(12)

and D is the 2 × 2 diagonal matrix of the diﬀusivities.

Solutions of Eq. (11) can be looked for in the form of

plane waves,

u(x, t) ∼ ei k·x+λt,

(13)

which, in Eq. (11), satisﬁes:

[λI − A(x) + k2D]u(x, t) = 0,

(14)

where I is the identity matrix. The nontrivial solutions
of Eq. 14) will provide a dispersion relation λ(k2), im-
plicitly:

det[λI − A(x) + k2D] = 0.

I = 0} and {M ∗

S = (b − c)K, M ∗

In the general situation of x-dependent K, it is not
possible to proceed further without the knowledge of
the equilibria. However,
in a system where K does
not depend on the space variable, an analytic assess-
ment of the stability of the homogeneous steady states
is possible. We have again two relevant steady states:
{M ∗
I =
−b/a + (b − c)K}. The dispersion relations correspond-
ing to each one of these are easily found from Eq. (15).
Those corresponding to the ﬁrst one (the equilibrium
with M ∗
I = 0) are shown in Fig. 3. They provide a direct
stability criterion. The slopes of the two lines are deter-
mined by the diﬀusion coeﬃcients only, and as such are
always negative. It can be seen that one of the tempo-
ral eigenvalues is always negative, provided that b > c,
which is, obviously, the sensible case in the biological
context since otherwise no positive solutions are found.
The other eigenvalue is negative provided that K < Kc,
which is the same stability condition found in the nonex-
tended case. Furthermore, when the state becomes un-
stable, the fastest growing mode of the perturbation (the
one with larger λ) is that with k2 = 0, an homogeneous
perturbation. Under such conditions, the perturbation
eventually drives the system to the other homogeneous
steady state, having a nonzero infected population. In
this simple model, hence, there are no spatially depen-
dent instabilities to the homogeneous steady state.

B. Refugia

Certainly, the most interesting situations arise when K
exhibits a spatial dependency. This is in fact the case in
the ﬁeld, where K follows the diversity of the landscape.
We have analyzed two cases of this situation, by means
of a numerical solution of Eqs. (5,6). The ﬁrst case is a

FIG. 4: Stationary solution of the extended model in one
dimension. The carrying capacity K consists of a spot of
high value, K > Kc, immersed in a region of lower capacity,
K < KC. The boundaries are shown as vertical lines. Model
parameters as in Fig. 1, D = 20, K = 1.5Kc in the refugium,
K = 0.9Kc outside of it.

1-dimensional system, where the proﬁle displayed by the
stationary solutions of the populations is readily accessi-
ble. The second one is a 2-dimensional system, intended
to provide a more realistic picture of the consequences of
the bifurcation.

We consider ﬁrst a 1-dimensional landscape, consisting
of a spot of high carrying capacity (K > Kc) in the
middle of a bigger region of low carrying capacity (K <
Kc). A typical situation is shown in Fig. 4, where vertical
lines represent the boundaries between the three zones.
From an arbitrary initial condition of the populations, a
steady state is attained in which the infected population
is concentrated at the spot of higher K, that constitutes
a “refugium.” A “leak” of infection is seen outside the
high-K region, due to the diﬀusion. Far from this, the
mouse population remains eﬀectively not infected.

In Fig. 5 we show the steady state of a 2-dimensional
realization of the system (5,6) on a square grid which
simulates a hypothetical landscape by assigning diﬀerent
values to Kij, the carrying capacity at each site. This is
supposed higher along a “river” as can be inferred from
the density plots shown. The non-infected population
occupies the whole landscape, with a non-homogeneous
density. Moreover, as expected from the results of the
homogeneous model, for small and moderate values of
the diﬀusion coeﬃcient, the infected population survives
in a patchy pattern, only in the regions of high carry-
ing capacity, becoming extinct in the rest. These “is-
lands” of infection become reservoirs of the virus [6] or
“refugia” [7], which are the places of highest risk for hu-
man exposure and contagion of the virus. It is also from
these refugia that the disease would spread (blurring the
patchiness, as observed in [3, 11]) when environmental
conditions change. While our model is qualitative at this

temporal patterns in the evolution of the population of
infected mice, and emergence of spatial features in the
landscape of infection, the so-called “refugia.” Our the-
oretical model, represented by (5,6), incorporates non-
linear terms describing infection transfer between mice
populations, a logistic description of their interactions
with the environment, and diﬀusive terms representing
their motion over the terrain. We have shown that the
combination of these various terms, while simple, natu-
rally predicts the temporal and spatial patterns whose
observations have motivated the analysis. Our tools of
investigation comprise of analytic stability considerations
which result in features such as bifurcation behavior (e.g.,
Fig. 1) as well as numerical procedures which yield the
temporal evolution (e.g., Fig. 2). The spatial extension
inherent in our model allows us to analyze the disper-
sion relation describing in a simpliﬁed case departures
from stationary states (see Fig. 3) and to deduce more
generally the existence of the “refugia” (see Figs. 4, 5).

We are currently in the process of investigating a num-
ber of further features of the spread of infection on the ba-
sis of the model and techniques explained in the present
paper. They include among others:
traveling waves
which can depict the spread of fronts of infection ema-
nating from the refugia in periods favorable to the prop-
agation of the infection; situations in which the mice are
limited in their meanderings to more or less localized re-
gions for territorial reasons but spread the infection when
the localized regions overlap; non-diﬀusive eﬀects in the
motion of the mice over the terrain; the eﬀect of stochas-
tic disturbances in the environment; and relevant details
of the infection process such as delay eﬀects related to
ﬁnite incubation periods. The results of these investiga-
tions will be reported elsewhere.

stage, this is precisely what is observed in the ﬁeld. We
comment in passing that the steady state distribution
of neither infected nor susceptible mice reproduces ex-
actly the distribution of the carrying capacity. This is
the result of the interaction of diﬀusion with the nonlin-
ear interactions. Thus, notice in the 1-dimensional rep-
resentation shown in Fig. 4 that, although the carrying
capacity follows a step distribution, the mice populations
are not steps. Both MS and MI have diﬀusive “leaking”
, the former exhibiting a dip as one moves out of the
region of large capacity. Similarly, in the 2-dimensional
case shown in Fig. 5, we see that the peaks of the popula-
tions represented by pure white appear at diﬀerent places
for the susceptible and infected. They do not occupy the
entire “river” region or follow precisely the peaks of the
distribution of the carrying capacity.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Two observed characteristics of Hantavirus infection
have served as the focus of our present investigation:

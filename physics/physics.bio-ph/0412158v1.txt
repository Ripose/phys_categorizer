Stochastic dynamics of magnetic nanoparticles and a mechanism of
biological orientation in the geomagnetic ﬁeld

V.N. Binhi1

A.M. Prokhorov General Physics Institute RAS, Moscow

The rotations of microscopic magnetic particles, magnetosomes, embedded
into the cytoskeleton are considered. A great number of magnetosomes are
shown to possess two stable equilibrium positions, between which there occur
transitions under the inﬂuence of thermal disturbances. The random rotations
attain the value of order of radian. The rate of the transitions and the prob-
ability of magnetosomes to stay in the diﬀerent states depend on magnetic
ﬁeld direction with respect to an averaged magnetosome’s orientation. This
eﬀect explains the ability of migrant birds to faultless orientation in long-term
passages in the absence of the direct visibility of optical reference points. The
sensitivity to deviation from an ‘ideal’ orientation is estimated to be 1–2 de-
grees. Possible participation of magnetosomes in biological eﬀects caused by
microwave electromagnetic ﬁelds is discussed.

birds, magnetic ﬁeld

Many birds of passage and other migrant animals overcome annually thou-
sands of miles and accurately ﬁnd the places of their seasonal habitats. This fact
is not completely understood yet. A number of hypothesis have been suggested
to account for this phenomenon [6]. In particular, the optical orientation and
navigation based on ‘maps’ of the terrestrial surface and starry sky are studied.
Also studied is the navigation along the lines of force of the geomagnetic ﬁeld,
which are known to be rigidly bound with the geophysical coordinates of the
Earth. The latter hypothesis ﬁnds the experimental validation in the numerous
facts of the ability of some biological species among microorganisms, insects,
ﬁshes, birds, and mammals to orient in a magnetic ﬁeld (MF) or react to the
change in its direction with respect to other acceptable reference marks.

At the same time, there is no recognized explanation for this phenomenon
yet. Magnetic orientation is a part of the more general problem of the biological
eﬃcacy of weak, less than 1 G, magnetic ﬁelds (MFs). A brief review of the
theoretical works in this area may be found in [1], and the detailed discussion
in [2].

The problem is in that magnetic energy of biologically active molecules in
the geomagnetic ﬁeld is very small. It does not exceed the energy of the electron
10−20 erg. This is more than

a biological reaction on the thermal ’noise’ background.

However, there are submicron particles, which have magnetic moments.
They have been found in many living objects, particularly in those displaying
magnetic navigation ability. They consist of the magnetite mainly. Magnetic
moment µ of the particles exceeds the elementary one in 7–9 orders. The energy
of their turn in a weak magnetic ﬁeld H is essentially larger than that of thermal
ﬂuctuations. For single-domain magnetite particles of radius r = 10−5 cm or
vJH equals approximately
100 nm in the geomagnetic ﬁeld the energy µH
24κT , where µ is the magnetic moment of the particle, v and J
480 G are

The cytoplasm near cell membranes is such that the turning of a micropar-
ticle may serve as a stimulus to cell division or ignite a nerve impulse. For
example, MF produced by a particle with the afore-cited parameters is of value
up to 0.1 T near the particle itself and strongly depends on its orientation.
Therefore, the turn of particle may appreciably change the rate of some chemi-
cal reactions with the participation of free-radical pairs.

Particularly interesting are the magnetite particles found in the brain of
many animals and in human brain. The nerve tissue of the brain is separated
from the circulatory system by the blood-brain barrier which is impermeable
for most chemicals. In turn, the circulatory system is separated from the diges-
tive system. Therefore, relatively large ferro- or ferrimagnetic particles cannot
penetrate into brain tissue as a pollutant. They are found to have a biogenic
origin, i.e.
they appear over time as a direct result of the crystallization in
brain matter. Biogenic magnetite particles are often called ‘magnetosomes’;
they were ﬁrst discovered in bacteria that displayed magnetotaxis [8]. It was re-
cently shown that magnetic nanoparticles may be produced in DNA complexes
[4]. Biogenic magnetite undoubtedly plays role in the navigation of migrant
birds [6], insects [5], and in other cases.

For the explanation of the magnetic navigation, the dynamics of magneto-
somes was modelled by using the equation of free rotations in a viscous liquid.
This regimen was assumed to be most favorable from the viewpoint of the mag-
nitude of possible eﬀects. However, the assumption about free rotations does not
match the data of electronic microscopy. For example, in some microorganisms,
magnetosomes are assembled into ﬁrm univariate chains, where rotations are
impossible. The idea was used as well that rigidly bound magnetosome brings
pressure on a closely set receptor. However, in this case, the energy is trans-
ferred to the number of molecules simultaneously, so that just a small amount
of energy relates to each one as compared to the κT .

It turns out that taking into account the not-too-strict elasticity of the
medium enables one to describe qualitatively new stochastic rotational dynam-
ics of magnetosomes that is useful to explain the magnetic navigation.

This article considers the dynamics of a magnetite particle embedded in the
cytoskeleton. The latter consists of a 3D net of protein ﬁbers of 6 to 25 nm in
diameter that include actin ﬁlaments, intermediate ﬁlaments, and microtubules.

The ends of these ﬁbers may be fastened to the membrane surface and to various
cell organelles. We assume the ﬁbers may also be fastened to a magnetosome
surface normally covered with a bilayer lipid membrane [9]. This ﬁxes the
position of the magnetosome and constrains its rotation to some extent. The
stationary orientation of the magnetosome generally does not follow the constant
MF direction. The balance of the elastic and ‘magnetic’ torques determines the
orientation now. The torque m aﬀecting a particle of the magnetic moment µ
in an MF H equals m = µ

H.

Here, putting aside the 3D character of the magnetosome rotations, we con-
sider the magnetosome’s motion in the plane of two vectors: the unit vector n of
the x-axis, with which the vector of magnetosome’s magnetic moment coincides
in the absence of the MF (equilibrium position, ϕ = 0), and the MF vector H,

and ϕ0 is the MF direction. Then, we assume the quantity of ﬁbers fastening
the magnetosome to the cytoskeleton may vary from particle to particle and
a signiﬁcant number of magnetosomes are mobile enough to markedly change
their orientation in the geomagnetic ﬁeld. This means the mechanical elasticity
due to the ﬁbers’ bending is of the same order as or less than the magnetic

the magnetosome in an averaged position with regard, for example, to animal’s
cranium.
In other words, in the frame of reference of the geomagnetic ﬁeld,
η is the deviation of animal’s orientation from an ‘ideal’ one in parallel to the
geomagnetic ﬁeld vector.

For small angles η the equation of motion takes the form: γ ˙ϕ + kϕ =

are transitions from well to well, the random turns being of signiﬁcant value
around 2 rad.

Consider the joint inﬂuence on a magnetosome of a random torque ξ(t) and a
magnetic signal related with the deviation of the organism’s orientation from the
reference one. The magnetic signal, which varies directly with η, results in the
change of the potential function, Fig. 2. The state of the magnetosome oriented
in the direction of the absolute minimum of the potential function becomes a
preferred one. The ratio of the probabilities of the magnetosome to locate in
the states ϕ± equals

where δU = 2U1 is the potential diﬀerence of the equilibrium points. This
implies:

The ‘signal’ proportional to the diﬀerence of the probability and its equilibrium
value 1/2 equals

The expression (5) and then (8) are valid for the equilibrium probability

We will note, if the signal-to-noise ratio in (7) was n times greater, the

minimally detectable angle would be n times less.

To explain the observable sensitivity of animals to very weak geomagnetic
variations, in [10] there was suggested that ensembles rather than single magne-
toreceptors detect MF changes. Given that, the averaging of the signals coming
from magnetoreceptors, which cause the signal-to-noise to enhance, occurs in
the cerebrum. With averaging, the signals of regular rotations are summed; for
chaotic rotations, what is summed are just the squares of the chaotic signals.
Therefore, the enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio is reached proportion-
ate to the square root of the number of magnetosomes contributing to endpoint

response. We remind that the density of magnetosomes in human brain tissue
106, and in brain meninges more than 108 crystals per
was measured around 5
gram [7]. Some birds have the concentration of the magnetite crystals in orders
higher.

×

There is another factor of the signal-to-noise enhancement that apparently
was not reported in literature earlier. If we assume each single bird makes ﬂight
corrective turns during passage in accord with the ﬂight path of the ﬂock, i.e. of
the most of birds, then the presence of an eﬀective averaging mechanism follows
that is taken out of the bird’s organism. Evidently, this mechanism reduces the
level of ﬂuctuations in ﬂight direction in proportion to the square root of the
number of birds in ﬂock.

Even without an additional enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio, the
retention of the orientation accurate to 1–2 degrees during passage could provide
its exactitude since the additional course correction may occur due to the optical
navigation in time periods of good visibility.

In conclusion, we note the following. (1) The stochastic dynamics of mag-
netosomes has peculiar features in ac MF (a stochastic resonance of magneto-
somes) and in the slowly varying geomagnetic and ‘zero’ magnetic ﬁelds as well.
These features enable one to explain the biological eﬀects of weak extremely-low-
frequency MFs, geomagnetic storms, and a ‘magnetic vacuum’. (2) The Debye
relaxation in water has a wide maximum in the microwave range of the electro-
magnetic radiation. The viscosity dispersion of water ν(ω) is related with this
maximum. High-frequency oscillations of magnetosomes in the microwave ﬁeld
result in a change of the cytoplasm viscosity in the layer nearby magnetosome’s
surface. This aﬀects the mean frequency of random rotations of magnetosomes
and may cause a biological response.

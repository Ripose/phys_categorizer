Abstract

The Kirchhoﬀ elastic theory of thin ﬁlaments with spontaneous curvature is
employed in the understanding of the onset of the kink transitions observed
in short DNA rings. Dynamical analysis shows that when its actual curvature
is less than some threshold value determined by the spontaneous curvature,
a circular DNA will begin to buckle to other shapes. The observable and the
dominant deformation modes are also determined by dynamical instability
analysis, and the diﬀerent eﬀects of Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions on DNA conﬁgura-
tional properties are qualitatively discussed.

This paper is motivated mainly by a recent experiment on short DNA rings.1,2 In this
experiment, Han et al. synthesized a kind of DNA sequences known to have intrinsic bending
tendency (in its undistorted state this kind of sequences will form an axial bend of at
least 30◦ per helical turn.3) They used these sequences to investigate whether DNA can
actually be kinked (forming large bendings over only few base pairs) and, if kinks really
turn up, what are the necessary conditions to produce them.1,2 Kink deformation has been
theoretically proposed to be a very important mechanism for wrapping DNA around the
nucleosome particles ever since the seventies,4–6 and a recent x-ray crystalline structure
of nucleosome core particle also demonstrated that DNA is not uniformly bent but has
maximal and minimal curvatures at diﬀerent positions.7 However, there had been no direct
evidence for the existence of kinks in DNA before the experiment of Han et al.1,2 which
clearly demonstrate this. To their great surprise, they found that kink formation is closely
related to total chain length and solvent ionic conditions. For DNA circles with 168 base
pairs (bps) or 16 helical turns, the chain is often kinked and form polygonal shapes if the
solution has an appropriate Zn2+ or Zn2+/Mg2+ concentrations. However, kink transition
does not take place in Mg2+ solution alone or in Zn2+/Mg2+ solution with high concentration
of Mg2+ ions. For DNA circles of 126-bp or 12 helical turns, no kink will ever occur, no
matter what kind of solvent ionic conditions.1,2 Trying to interpret their novel observations,
Han et al. suggested that axial stresses exist in 168-bp DNAs and they are the main reason
for the observed kink deformations.

In this article we attempt to check, from a theoretical point of view, the validity of this
insight and try to understand the radically diﬀerent roles played by Mg2+ and Zn2+ ions in
DNA kink transition. The spontaneous curvature3 of the DNA material used is anticipated
to play a signiﬁcant role and we model the DNA chain as a thin Kirchhoﬀ elastic ﬁlament8
with spontaneous curvatures, i.e., adjacent cross-sections of the ﬁlament are tilted a certain
angle with respect to each other (in a mean-ﬁeld sense). The ﬁlament will curve to a planar
ring of curvature κ0 in its natural undistorted state, as what is observed in experiments.3
Our study shows that a nonzero spontaneous curvature is required for the onset of the kink
transitions observed in short DNA rings, in consistency with the insight of Han et al.

We deﬁne a moving orthonormal coordinate system

along the
ﬁlament axis line, with d3 being the tangential unit vector at arc length s. In general the
ﬁlament conﬁguration will change with time t,9,10 so the direction vectors are also functions
d2 = d3;
of t. The choice of the other two unit vectors d1 and d2 is arbitrary as long as d1 ×
in our case we deﬁne d1 to point to the tilt direction of the ﬁlament cross-section at each
arc length point s, for convenience. Then the free energy functional of such a ﬁlament is
equivalent to the following form

model partly because of the experimental fact that kinking locations are not (or only very
weakly) correlated with base pair types.2

In proposing Eq. (1) we have also take into account via the spontaneous twist rate ω0
the fact that ordinary DNA can also have a linking number deﬁciency of 5%.12 For DNA
circles with 168 bps (16 turns), it may well have 0.8 turns of initial twist in the DNA circle;
for those with 126 bps (12 turns), it may well have 0.6 turns of initial twist. However,
this (possible) spontaneous twisting tendency cannot explain the above mentioned kink
deformations of short DNA. The reason is the following: For an elastic ﬁlament formed by
two chains interwinding around each other, such as DNA and actin, a well known model13–15
concerning the eﬀect of the ﬁxed linking number shows that when the total twisting number
variance ∆T w exceeds some threshold value T wc = √n2
2), a planar circle
will buckle to the n-th deformation mode (this relation is also rederived in Appendix B),
where A and C are respectively the bending and twisting persistence length (for DNA A
50
nm and C
75 nm.) If the kink deformations are indeed induced by this topological eﬀect,
then for the typical square (n = 4) polygonal kinked shape observed in the references1,2 to
appear the total twisting number of the 168-bp DNA ring are required to deviate from its
equilibrium value up to T wc = 3 turns.13–15 This value is almost four times the actual value
of 0.8 turns. Thus it seems that the spontaneous twist will only play a neglectable role in
the kink deformations of short DNA, and we feel it might be appropriate to focus on the
macroscopic bending tendency of the ﬁlament by setting ω0 = 0 in Eq. 1. The results derived
based on this approximation also conﬁrm this to be reasonable, as can be seen later. To be
complete, we have also listed out the general result of model (1) in the case of ω0 6
= 0 at the
end of this paper (Appendix B), it reduces to the well known result in the references13–15
for the limiting case of DNA with intrinsic twist but no intrinsic bend (κ0 = 0).

Recently Goriely, Tabor10 (and others) have suggested a powerful way to investigate
on the dynamical properties of Kirchhoﬀ thin ﬁlaments. We will use their procedure in
studying the stabilities of model (1). Goriely and Tabor have worked out the stationary
shape equations (SSEs) and the dynamical variational equations (DVEs)10 for the simplest
case of a ﬁlament without any spontaneous curvature. Here, for our purpose, we ﬁrst give
the SSEs and DVEs for a general Kirchhoﬀ ﬁlament. (Since reference10 has demonstrated
a way to get the DVEs we will not waste space in writing down the detailed calculations,
but only notice here that there are some typographical errors in this reference.) After the
general SSEs and DVEs are obtained, we then turn back to the special case of Eq. (1).

sionless forms. After this operation, we perform a basis perturbation operation suggested

Eqs. (5-8) determine the stationary conﬁgurations and their corresponding internal force f (0)
and torque (Ω(0)

The stability of a stationary conﬁguration is governed by the DVEs, which are the lengthy

The SSEs and DVEs derived above can be applied in studying the dynamical properties
of any kind of Kirchhoﬀ ﬁlaments, however in this paper we will only study a very special
case, the elastic energy Eq. (1), with K e
3 = 0. In this case, the SSEs
Eqs. (5-8) demonstrate that the planar ring conﬁguration is a stationary solution, with

The general behavior of g is shown in Fig. 1. It clearly demonstrates that only when the
actual curvature κ of a ring is smaller than its spontaneous curvature κ0 will it be possible
for the ring to deform. This prediction is in agreement with the experiment of Han et al.,1,2

of a ring (Fig. 1). Thus, our present work can qualitatively explain the novel phenomenon
of DNA described in the introduction part: 126-bp DNA will not kink because no matter
what ionic conditions its κ is always
κc; on the other hand, at some appropriate ionic
conditions the curvature of a 168-bp DNA can become < κc, and kink deformation will be
triggered.1,2 When taking into account the possibility of nonzero ω0 in Eq. (1), a threshold
condition similar to Eq. (23) is derived in Appendix B.
f (1)
1 , α2, α3}
will be excited, therefore the DNA
conﬁguration will deform out of the ring plane rather than deform in the same plane as the
ring lies in. Thus in the present we can not tell whether the buckled shapes will actually
evolve to the kinked ones observed in experiment.1,2 To know this, nonlinear analysis beyond
the buckling point is needed and it is very much involved to perform. However, we believe
that the linear analysis we employed here has correctly described the behaviors of DNA at
the onset of kinking.

At the initial stage of buckling, only

Experiments1–3 shows that Zn2+ ions can enhance the instability of DNA rings, while
Mg2+ ions gives a negative eﬀect. Comparing this with the theoretical analysis, it is reason-
able for us to suggest that Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions will respectively increase and decrease the
spontaneous curvature of the DNA chain. We are informed2,3 that that Zn2+ mainly binds
to DNA base pairs, and Mg2+ interacts with the back-bone phosphate ions. It might be
possible that the intercalation of Zn2+ takes place mainly at the exposed side of the DNA
ring hence causing an increase in its spontaneous curvature. The following analysis shows
that the eﬀect of Zn2+ to the spontaneous curvature is very signiﬁcant.

The largest solution of ∆L1(σ) = 0 changes with n at four ﬁxed κ/κ0 ratios are shown in
Fig. 2. The possible deformation modes are obviously determined from these curves as they
correspond to real positive values of σ. The value of n corresponding to the peaks of these
curves (nc) are just the most observable modes,10 because these modes grow the fastest. At
4,2 therefore we estimate from the solid
1mM ZnBr2 it is shown experimentally that nc
0.25. The value of κ0 in Zn2+-free solutions is till not precisely
line of Fig. 2 that κ/κ0 ≃
known, but it must be higher than 2π/126 bp−1.2,3 On the other hand, in this condition
2π/90 bp−1 if we
168-bp is not kinked, so we must have κ
set Γ = 2/3 in Eq. (23). Therefore, when there is no Zn2+ ions in the solution, 2π/126 bp−1
0.75, (the threshold case κ/κ0 = 0.55 is shown in
≤
the dot-dashed curve of Fig. 2.) Compare this estimate with the value 0.25 corresponding
to 1mM ZnBr2 we can conclude that the addition of 1mM Zn2+ ions makes the value of the
spontaneous curvature of DNA increase at least one times.

This high eﬃciency of Zn2+ make us believe it to be possible that Zn2+ ions will induce
spontaneous curvatures to DNAs even when they are originally linear and cause them to
kink if they are loaded with stresses. This may be of vital biological signiﬁcance. For
example, it is known that transcription and replication of DNA occur with the participation
of speciﬁc enzymes which contain the Zn2+ ion at the active site. And it is also found that
transcription proceeds simultaneously with conformational changes of the DNA chain.17
More investigations on this respect are deserved.

Appendix B: The linear instability result for Eq. (1) with nonzero
ω0

In the main text, we have focused our attention to the ω0 = 0 case of medel Eq. (1). For
the general case of nonzero ω0, following the same procedure as discussed in the main text
we can obtain the threshold condition for the n-th mode to become instable. It reads

(κ2κ0(Γ

n2) + κκ2

0(κ0 + Γκn2) + Γκ3n2(n2

In the limiting case of ω0 = 0 (the ﬁlament has intrinsic bend but no intrinsic twist), Eq.
(30) reduces to Eq. (23) of the main text. In the limiting case of κ0 = 0 (then DNA has
intrinsic twist but no intrinsic bend), Eq. (30) reduces to

Eq. (31) is just the same result obtained in previous references for a chain with intrinsic
twist,13–15 showing the correctness of this method.

FIG. 2.

The relation between the largest solution of ∆L1(σ) = 0 [Eq. (20)] and n, at
κ/κ0 = 0.25 (the solid line), 0.30 (the dotted line), 0.40 (the dashed line), and 0.55 (the dot-dashed
168) for the 168-bp DNA10,12−15 and choose
line) for the 168-bp DNA ring. We set κ = π/(0.34
Γ = 2/3.10,15 The most dominant deformation mode determined by the peaks of these curves in-
creases with the decreasing of κ/κ0, and the number of observable modes also increases as κ/κ0
decreases. At κ/κ0 = 0.25, the dominant mode is n = 4 and the modes n = 2, 3, 4 can be observed;
2 will be excited. This prediction is in very
while at κ/κ0 = 0.55, no deformation mode with n
close agreement with experimental observations.2

The paradigm of stochastic resonance (SR)—the idea that
signal detection and transmission may beneﬁt from noise—
has met with great interest in both physics and the neuro-
sciences. But simpliﬁcations made to render models of neu-
ronal activity mathematically tractable can be carried too far:
the eﬀect sought after may be introduced by the simplifying
assumptions. In particular, several authors have posited that
the stimulus driving a neuron is reset to a ﬁxed phase ev-
ery time the neuron ﬁres a spike, so as to allow for analysis
based on renewal theory. We argue that this assumption is
biologically untenable and demonstrate that stochastic reso-
nance occurs only because the ﬁring pattern of the neuron
matches the ﬁxed reset phase optimally for a particular noise
amplitude. Stochastic resonance vanishes as soon as the reset
phase is allowed to adapt to the noise amplitude in a biolog-
ically plausible way. We conclude that stochastic resonance
as reported earlier is caused by the presumed stimulus reset
and is thus an artefact of simplifying assumptions.

I. INTRODUCTION

The improvement of signal transmission and detection
through noise has been studied keenly over the past two
decades under the paradigm of stochastic resonance; for
recent reviews see Refs. [1,2]. This holds true for the
neurosciences in particular, which have for a long time
been puzzled by the seemingly irregular activity of the
nervous system. A long series of experiments has now
ﬁrmly established that sensory neurons of various modal-
ities beneﬁt from ambient noise [3–9].

Theoretical eﬀorts to explain stochastic resonance in
neuronal systems had to abstract rigorously from the bi-
ological complexity of real neurons to facilitate mathe-
matical treatment [10–14]. The leaky integrate-and-ﬁre
model neuron [15] is likely the most widely studied of
these abstract neuron models, especially in investigations
of the neuronal code [16–21]. Several groups have inves-
tigated stochastic resonance in this neuron model in the
following setup [22–25]: The neuron is driven by white
noise and a sinusoidal stimulus (input signal), which is
reset to a ﬁxed phase φ0 every time the neuron ﬁres a
spike (i.e., emits a stereotyped voltage pulse). This re-
set assumption turns the sequence of interspike intervals
(ISI) into a renewal process [26], facilitating further anal-
ysis as reviewed in Sec. II B.

1

Unfortunately, the presumed reset is highly implausi-
ble as it implies, e.g., that an auditory neuron would re-
set the sound waves arriving at the eardrum. The reset
might be plausible if the sinusoidal stimulus was gener-
ated within the neuron, as is the case in certain tempera-
ture sensitive cells [27]. The ﬁring patterns of these cells,
though, may not be characterized as renewal processes,
since the distribution of ISI lengths depends strongly on
the phase at which the spike preceeding an interval is
ﬁred [28]. The reset assumption is thus diﬃcult to rec-
oncile with biological ﬁndings.

We demonstrate in this paper that the stochastic res-
onance reported in earlier work by one of us and others
[23–25] is an artefact of the implausible reset assump-
tion. It occurs because a ﬁxed reset phase φ0 is chosen
independent of the input noise level and this phase is in
some sense optimal for a particular amount of noise, as
will be discussed in Sec. III.
If, on the other hand, in
an attempt to render the reset somewhat more realistic,
the reset phase is adapted to the input noise amplitude
σ in a biologically plausible manner, the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) becomes a monotonous function of the noise
amplitude, i.e., stochastic resonance vanishes. This is
expounded in Sec. IV, while consequences and related
work are discussed in Sec. V. For a detailed account of
the results presented here, see Ref. [28].

We would like to include a remark on terminology.
Several authors refer to stimulation with reset as en-
dogenous, and without reset as exogenous [24,25,29]. As
remarked above, sinusoidal self-stimulation (i.e., endoge-
nous stimulation) evokes ﬁring patterns from thermore-
ceptor neurons that cannot be reconciled with a stim-
ulus reset, whence we suggest that these terms should
be abandoned. We propose the terms constrained and
unconstrained to refer to stimulation with and without
reset, respectively.

II. MODEL AND METHODS

We review brieﬂy the integrate-and-ﬁre neuron model
and the methods used in analyzing the response prop-
erties of the neuron. For a detailed discussion, see
Refs. [23,28].

A. Leaky integrate-and-ﬁre neuron

The leaky integrate-and-ﬁre neuron model sketches the
neuron as a capacitor with leak current, which is charged
by an input current I(t) until the potential v(t) across
the capacitor (membrane potential) reaches a threshold
Θ. At that instant, an output spike is recorded and the
potential reset to vr < Θ. The assumption that the stim-
ulus is reset after each spike as well, implies that the
membrane potential evolves according to

˙v(τ ) = −v(τ ) + µ + q cos(Ωτ + φ0) + σξ(τ ),

(1)

in between any two spikes [15]; τ is intra-interval time,
i.e., τ runs from zero in every interval. µ is the DC
component of the stimulus, q its AC amplitude, Ω the
nominal frequency, and φ0 the ﬁxed but arbitrary reset
phase. All quantities are measured in their natural units,
i.e., the membrane time constant τm and threshold Θ.
vr = 0 is assumed throughout. The noise term in Eq. (1)
subsumes both biochemical and network noise [30,31],
and is taken to be Gaussian white noise [hξ(t)ξ(t′)i =
δ(t − t′)]. A diﬀerent realization of the noise is used for
each interval.
intervals are thus statistically independent and
the interval lengths form a sequence [τ1, τ2, . . . , τk, . . .] of
independently, identically distributed random variables
with density ρ(τ ). The latter can be computed numer-
ically or approximated in closed form [28,32,33]. The
sequence of intervals thus forms a renewal process, which
is fully characterized by the ISI density ρ(τ ) [26].

All

The sequence of intervals corresponds to an output

spike train f (t) = Pk δ(t − tk) with spike times tk =
Pj≤k τj. This spike train is evoked by an eﬀective stim-

ulus consisting of piecewise sinusoids of length τk, as
shown in Fig. 1. In contrast, we call the pure sinusoid
cos(Ωt+φ0) the nominal stimulus. Figure 1 demonstrates
that the eﬀective stimulus is approximately periodic only
for a reset phase of φ0 ≈ 0, while it is an irregular se-
quence of piecewise sinusoids for other choices of the reset
phase. Since we are interested in the transmission of pe-
riodic signals, we focus here on φ0 = 0 in accordance with
earlier work [23–25]. We further restrict ourselves to sub-
threshold stimuli, i.e., supt→∞ v(t) = µ + q/√1 + Ω2 < 1
for σ = 0 from integration of Eq. 1. Such stimuli, which
elicit spikes only in the presence of noise, appear to be
more relevant for the encoding of periodic signals than
superthreshold stimuli [34].

B. Signal-to-noise ratio

The performance of a signal processor is commonly
measured in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio in studies
on stochastic resonance. Since the spike train elicited
from the neuron is a renewal process by virtue of the
stimulus reset, its power spectral density (PSD) is given
by [35]

2

S(ω) =

1

πhτi (cid:18)1 + 2ℜ

˜ρ(ω)

1 − ˜ρ(ω)(cid:19) , ω > 0,

where

˜ρ(ω) = Z ∞

0

ρ(τ )eiωτ dτ

(2)

(3)

is the Fourier transform of the ISI density and hτi the
mean interspike interval length; note that ρ(τ ) = 0 for
τ < 0 by deﬁnition.

The input to the neuron is not purely sinusoidal due
to the stimulus reset, and the maximum of the PSD will
thus be shifted away from the stimulus frequency Ω, see
Fig. 2(a). We thus deﬁne the signal as the maximum of
the PSD in a window around Ω [23,24]

ˆS = S( ˆΩ) = max{S(ω)|0.9Ω < ω < 1.1Ω}

(4)

and refer to the location ˆΩ of the maximum as peak fre-
quency. The signal ˆS is undeﬁned if S(ω) has no absolute
maximum within the window as, e.g., in Fig. 2(b). The
white power spectrum of a Poissonian spike train of equal
intensity, SP = (πhτi)−1, is used as reference noise level
[36], so that the signal-to-noise ratio becomes

RSN =

ˆS
Sp

.

(5)

III. FIXED RESET PHASE

For ﬁxed reset phase, φ0 = 0, the model neuron shows
typical stochastic resonance behavior, i.e., a maximum of
the SNR at an intermediate albeit small noise amplitude
σmax [solid line in Fig. 3(a)] [23]. The mechanism in-
ducing stochastic resonance is indicated in Fig. 3(b): the
maximal SNR is reached when the peak frequency ˆΩ and
the reset frequency Ωres = 2π/Tres coincide, where Tres
is the mode of the ISI density, i.e., the most probable in-
terval between two stimulus resets. Coincidence of reset
and peak frequencies thus indicates synchronization be-
tween the stimulus reset and the correlations dominating
the power spectrum of the output spike train.

This eﬀect may intuitively be explained as follows
[23,25]. The neuron will preferentially ﬁre around a par-
ticular phase of the stimulus if noise is weak. As noise is
increased, the threshold is more easily surmounted and
spikes tend to occur at an earlier phase of the stimu-
lus. For a particular noise amplitude, the preferred ﬁring
phase and the reset phase will match such that the neu-
ron attains the optimal signal-to-noise ratio. Note that
RSN is maximized as preferred ﬁring and reset phases are
close, but not identical to each other.

IV. NOISE-ADAPTED RESET PHASE

Let us pursue the concept of a preferred ﬁring phase
further in an attempt to justify the assumed stimulus re-
set: If a neuron is driven by a sinusoidal stimulus which
is not reset after each spike, then its ﬁring pattern will
approach a stationary stochastic process [37,38]. In this
stationary state, the neuron will preferentially ﬁre at a
particular phase φ∗. Using φ0 = φ∗ as reset phase thus
implies that the stimulus is reset to that phase at which
spikes most likely occur, i.e., that the reset will not be
noticeable on average. Bulsara et al. employed this ar-
gument to justify the reset assumption [22]. But they
further assumed implicitly that φ∗ was independent of
noise and might be chosen at will, namely φ∗ = φ0 = 0.
These assumptions are not tenable, since the preferred
phase depends on both stimulus and noise, see Fig. 3(d).
We therefore suggest to use as reset phase, for each
value of the noise amplitude, the preferred ﬁring phase
observed under stimulation without reset for that noise
amplitude,

φ0 = φ0(σ) = φ∗(σ) .

(6)

φ∗(σ) is deﬁned as the mode of the ﬁring phase density
χ(ψ); the latter gives the probability for the neuron to
ﬁre at a particular phase. It may be obtained via Markov
chain analysis of the neuronal ﬁring pattern under stim-
ulation without reset [37,38], and is commonly measured
in neurophysiological experiments as [39,40].

The preferred phase φ∗(σ), and thus the reset phase
φ0(σ), then varies with the input noise amplitude as
shown in Fig. 3(d): For weak noise, the reset is ad-
vanced to shorten interspike intervals, while for strong
noise the reset is delayed to protract ﬁring. As a conse-
quence, the reset frequency Ωres becomes identical to the
nominal stimulus frequency Ω for all noise amplitudes,
see Fig. 3(c). The signal-to-noise ratio, ﬁnally, increases
monotonously as the input noise vanishes, cf. Fig. 3(a).
The same eﬀect is found for other stimulus parameters
as well, as shown in Fig. 4. Note that in the latter cases,
the average membrane potential remains further below
threshold than the for the example shown in Fig. 3, so
that higher noise amplitudes are required to elicit a mea-
surable response from the neuron.

Thus stochastic resonance does not occur if the reset
phase φ0(σ) is properly adapted to the noise amplitude.
Plainly speaking, the reset phase is, for each noise ampli-
tude, optimally adjusted to the dynamics of the neuron,
whence nothing can be gained by noise.

sult is a more precise rendition of arguments given else-
where [23,25]. Beyond this, we have clearly demonstrated
that the observed eﬀect is an artefact of the artiﬁcially
ﬁxed reset phase.
If the reset is adjusted to the pre-
ferred ﬁring phase at each noise level, the SNR increases
monotonously as noise vanishes.

Our ﬁndings should not be restricted to the particular
neuron model studied here. We expect that any neuron
model which allows to match, by variation of the input
noise amplitude, the preferred ﬁring phase against a pre-
deﬁned reset phase will exhibit stochastic resonance as
described in Sec. III. This eﬀect will vanish if the re-
set phase is allowed to adapt to the noise amplitude as
discussed in Sec. IV. This indicates that excessive sim-
pliﬁcation for the sake of mathematical convenience may
induce just those eﬀects that are searched for.

The reader might be puzzled in view of the results
reported here that stochastic resonance occurs in the
integrate-and-ﬁre neuron if the stimulus is not reset [37].
The crucial diﬀerence is that studies of the latter ef-
fect consider either explicitly [37] or implicitly [41] the
power spectral density of a spike train of ﬁnite duration,
while an inﬁnite spike train is assumed here, cf. Sec. II B.
Trains of very low intensity but precisely phase-locking
to the stimulus, as evoked in the presence of very weak
noise, thus yield a small ﬁnite-time signal-to-noise ratio,
while their inﬁnite-time SNR may be large. We expect
that eﬀects similar to the unconstrained case were also to
be found for the constrained case, would the ﬁnite-time
SNR be used. Given the biological implausibility of the
stimulus reset, this topic does not warrant further study
in our opinion, though.

A criticism which might brought forth against this and
related studies [37,23–25] is the use of the spectrum of a
Poisson spike train as reference noise level in the deﬁ-
nition of the signal-to-noise ratio. This criticism is par-
ticularly valid in view of recent results by Spiridon and
Gerstner, who argue that noise power in spike trains is
suppressed below the Poisson-level in the frequency range
relevant to the neural code to facilitate signal processing
in neuronal networks [42].

V. DISCUSSION

We have shown that the integrate-and-ﬁre neuron
model exhibits stochastic resonance induced by a fre-
quency match if the stimulus driving the neuron is re-
set to a ﬁxed phase φ0 after each spike ﬁred. This re-

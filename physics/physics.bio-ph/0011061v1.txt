Abstract

In thermally ﬂuctuating long linear polymeric chain in solution, the
ends come from time to time into a direct contact or a close vicinity of
each other. At such an instance, the chain can be regarded as a closed
one and thus will form a knot or rather a virtual knot. Several earlier
studies of random knotting demonstrated that simpler knots show their
highest occurrence for shorter random walks than more complex knots.
However up to now there were no rules that could be used to predict the
optimal length of a random walk, i.e. the length for which a given knot
reaches its highest occurrence. Using numerical simulations, we show here
that a power law accurately describes the relation between the optimal
lengths of random walks leading to the formation of diﬀerent knots and
the previously characterized lengths of ideal knots of the corresponding
type.

keywords: knots, polymers, scaling laws, DNA, random walks.

A random walk can frequently lead to the formation of knots and it was
proven that as the walk becomes very long the probability of forming nontrivial
knots upon closure of such a walk tends to one [1, 2]. Many diﬀerent simula-
tion approaches were used to study random knotting [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Probably
the most fundamental one is by simulation of ideal random chains where each
segment of the chain is of the same length and has no thickness [4, 8]. In ideal
random chains the neighboring segments are not correlated with each other and
thus show the average deﬂection angle of 90◦. Ideal random chain behavior is
interesting from physical point of view as it reﬂects statistical behavior of long

1

polymer chains in so-called melt phase and in θ solvents where excluded volume
eﬀect vanishes [8]. Highly diluted polymer chains in θ solvents are unlikely to
interact with each other and therefore upon circularization will form mainly
knots rather than links. In thermally ﬂuctuating long linear polymers the ends
of the same chain can come from time to time into a close vicinity of each other.
This can lead to a cyclization of the polymer whereby the end closure frequently
traps a nontrivial knot on the chain. By studying knotting in simulated ideal
random chains we thus can gain insight into knotting of real polymer chains in
θ solvents and in the dense melt phase frequently used for the preparation of
such synthetic polymeric materials like fabrics, paints or adhesives [9]. However,
ideal chains do not reﬂect the behavior of real polymer chains in good solvent.
Intramolecular interactions cannot be neglected in these conditions, but can be
well approximated by introducing an eﬀective diameter. When such a constraint
is introduced into simulated chains one can also model knotting of polymers in
good solvents like for example knotting of DNA molecules in typical reaction
buﬀers used for biochemical experiments [4]. Our simulations can be adjusted
to both situations and we shall present here results for random chains with and
without an eﬀective diameter.

Several earlier studies of random knotting showed that simpler knots reach a
maximum of their occurrence for shorter length of random walks than this re-
quired for the formation of more complex knots [5, 6, 10]. In considering the
equilibrium ensemble of closed walks, these studies showed that the relative fre-
quency of occurrence of each type of knot ﬁrst increases with the length of the
chain, then passes through a maximum and ﬁnally decreases exponentially at
very long chains. However, these earlier studies did not attempt to establish a
relation between the type of a knot and the optimal length of a random walk
leading to the maximal occurrence of this knot. If we consider a thermally ﬂuc-
tuating polymer with ends that can stick to each other with the energy much
smaller than kT , then from time to time these ends will stay in contact for a
short period and at this moment the polymer will form a trivial or nontrivial
knot. In this study, we characterize statistical ensembles of ﬂuctuating linear
polymers in order to ﬁnd speciﬁc lengths (expressed in number of statistical
segments) at which a given type of knot or rather a virtual knot reaches its
highest occurrence.

Recently we have characterized ideal geometric conﬁgurations of knots corre-
sponding to the shortest trajectories of ﬂexible cylindrical tube with uniform
diameter to form a given knot [11]. The ratio of the length to diameter of
the tube forming ideal conﬁguration of a given knot is a topological invariant
and we call it here the length of ideal knots.
Ideal knots turned out to be
good predictors of statistical behavior of random knots. So for example the
writhe of ideal conﬁguration of a given knot was equal to the average writhe of
thermally ﬂuctuating polymer forming a given random knot [11]. We showed
also that electrophoretic migrations of various types of knotted DNA molecules

2

of the same molecular weight or their expected sedimentation constants were
practically proportional to the length of the corresponding ideal knots [12, 13].
Therefore we decided here to check whether the length of ideal knots is related
to the length of ideal random chains for which diﬀerent knots reach their high-
est occurrence. To this aim we used the following simulation procedure. 2·109
random walks of 170 segments were started and each time the growing end ap-
proached the starting end to a distance smaller than the length of one segment
the conﬁguration was saved upon which the walk was continued for the remain-
ing number of steps. Each vector (segment) of the chain was randomly chosen
from uniformly distributed vectors pointing from the center to the surface of the
unit sphere. Thus some of the random walks showed one or more approaches
of the growing and starting ends and we collected 2·109 random walks for every
number of segments between 5 and 170. Each saved conﬁguration with nearby
ends was then closed with a connecting segment and the type of the formed knot
was determined by the calculation of its Alexander polynomial [7, 14, 15, 16].

For random linear walks to eﬃciently form diﬀerent knots a compromise has to
be met between the length optimizing their close approach and the length which
is suﬃcient to form a knot of a given type. The present analysis diﬀers from
earlier studies [4, 5, 10] where the statistics was based only on equilibrium knot-
ting of closed walks. In our case, we consider the formation of knots through the
approach of the terminal segments of linear chains. Therefore not only closed
chains, but also linear chains are taken into account in our statistics.
Figure 1 shows the occurrence proﬁles of diﬀerent knots with up to six cross-
ings as a function of the length of random walk which leads to the formation
of these knots. It is visible that trefoil knots show their highest occurrence for
25 ± 1 segments while 41 knots form most frequently for 42 ± 1 segments. The
formation of more complicated knots happens much less frequently than this of
simpler knots, therefore in the insert in Figure 1 a change of scale is applied to
better visualize the occurrence of more complicated knots. We observed that
the obtained probabilities values for diﬀerent knots can be well ﬁtted with the
function

Pk(N ) = a(N − N0)b exp(

−N c
d )

(1)

where for each knot a, b and d are free parameters, c is an empirical constant
equal to 0.18, N0 is the minimal number of segments required to form a given
type of knot [17] without the closing segment and N is the number of segments
in the walk. Our ﬁtting function was adapted from Katritch et al. 2000 [18]
but modiﬁed to take into account the probability of cyclization. Table 1 lists
the positions of maximal occurrence for the analyzed types of knots. In order
to concentrate on the position of the maximum for diﬀerent knots and not on
their actual probability values we decided to present probability proﬁles for each
knot upon normalizing them by assigning a value 1 to the respective maximum
of probabilities.

Figure 1: Probability of forming a given knot amoung all random walks of a
given size is plotted as a function of the number of segments in the walk. Note
the change of the scale between the main panel and the insert. Diagrams of the
corresponding knots are drawn to visualize the diﬀerences between analyzed
types of knots. The notations accompanying the drawn diagrams correspond
to those in standard tables of knots [21], where the main number indicates the
minimal number of crossings possible for this knot type and the index indicates
the tabular position amongst the knots with the same minimal crossings number.
Formed knot types were recognised by computing their Alexander polynomial.
Since Alexander polynomial does not distinguish between left-handed and right-
handed knots of the same type, we have to group them together and therefore
the drawn diagrams of the knots do not show the handedness. This polynomial
has sometimes the same value for diﬀerent knots like for example knot 61 and 946
[22]. However within groups of knots with the same Alexander polynomial more
complicated knots have such a low occurrence that their eﬀect on the position
of the maximum of the simplest knot within the group can be neglected.

Figure 2 presents normalized probability proﬁles for the analyzed knots. It is
visible that diﬀerent knots show now quite similar type of proﬁles (e.g. knot
51 and 52) whereby the diﬀerences in the position of maximum between knots
with diﬀerent minimal number of crossings can be easily perceived. It may be
surprising that we observed here such a short optimal length for analyzed knots
while earlier studies showed that several hundred segments are needed to ob-
serve maximum occurrence of a given knot among closed walks of a given size
[5, 10, 19]. This is simply due to the fact that our system takes into account
the probability of cyclization.

In Figure 3 we show the relation between the optimal length of random knots
and the length of the corresponding ideal knots. This relation is well approxi-
mated by a power law function. Upon ﬁtting the free parameters of this function
in the simulation data obtained for the knots with up to 7 crossings, we decided
to check if by knowing the length of ideal conﬁgurations of more complicated
knots we can predict positions of the maximum of occurrence for the corre-
sponding random knots. As the statistics of random knotting gets poor for
knots with increasing crossing number we limited veriﬁcations of our predic-

5

tions to these knots with eight crossings which at their maxima of occurrence
were represented more than 500 times out of 2·109 random walks with a given
number of segments. Analysis of our simulation data (Figure 3) positively veri-
ﬁed our predictions for optimal sizes of random walks leading to the formation
of these knots.

Figure 3: Relation between the length of the ideal geometric representations of
knots [23] and positions of maximal occurrence for the corresponding random
knots. The lower curve: the optimal length of random knots with an eﬀective di-
ameter set to zero. The simulation data for the knots with up to seven crossings
were ﬁtted with a power law function and the best ﬁt curve was extrapolated.
Data points for eight crossing knots for which we obtained good statistics co-
incide with the extrapolated curve. The upper curve: data points of maximal
occurrence of knots for random chains with an eﬀective diameter set to 0.05 of
the segment length. In both cases a power law function adequately describes
the relation between the optimal length of random knots and the length of ideal
knots of a given type. Best ﬁt parameters for both cases are indicated.

As already mentioned, ideal random chains have no thickness and this causes
that they reﬂect the behavior of polymers in the melt phase where thin polymers
have practically no exclusion volume [7, 8]. However when polymers are sus-
pended in a good solvent, like DNA in aqueous solution, the exclusion volume
of polymers becomes not negligible and this strongly decreases the probability
of forming knots [7]. It was observed that the higher the eﬀective diameter of

6

the polymer the lower the probability of forming knots by random cyclization
[4, 7, 19]. We decided therefore to investigate whether a power law relation
between the length of ideal knots and the optimal length of randomly knotted
chains also holds for chains with an exclusion volume. To this aim from our
original set of 2·109 ideal random walks for every segment length from 5 to 100
we selected the walks which never showed a closer approach between any pair
of non neighboring segments than the considered eﬀective diameter (terminal
segments of the chain are considered as neighboring ones). Subsequently we
analyzed all conﬁgurations with approached ends for the types of formed knots
and calculated the probabilities of various knots among all random chains which
fulﬁlled the criteria of a given eﬀective diameter. We observed that as the ef-
fective diameter grows the probability of forming various knots decreases and
positions of the maximum move toward longer chains. Figure 3 (dashed line)
shows the relation between the length of ideal knots and the optimal length of
corresponding random knots formed by chains with the eﬀective diameter being
set to 0.05 of the segment length. The eﬀective diameter 0.05 corresponds to
this of diluted solutions of DNA molecules in about 100 mM NaCl [4]. In the
case of DNA each segment in the random chain corresponds to 300 base pair
long region [20].
It is visible that the data can be again approximated by a
power law function. Fact that lengths of ideal knots shows a correlation with
the optimal sizes of corresponding random knots formed by chains with a given
eﬀective diameter provides another example that ideal knots are good predictors
of physical behavior of real knots [11].

Post factum it might seem to be obvious that knots requiring higher length of
the rope to tie them should require higher length of a random walk to reach
their highest occurrence. However until recently the minimal length of the rope
to tie a given knot was not known. In addition the relation between the optimal
length of random walk producing a given knot and the length of ideal knot was
not yet proposed in the literature. On the other hand a simple expectation
would dictate that the shorter the length of ideal knot the higher the prob-
ability of its formation. So for example trivial knots are more frequent than
trefoils and these are more frequent than 41 knots. However this does not hold
for 51 and 52 knots. Ideal knot 51 is slightly shorter than ideal 52 knot (which
is consistent with the optimal size of random walks leading to the formation
of corresponding knots), but 52 knot formation by random walks is circa twice
more frequent than formation of 51 knot. Therefore the values of random knots
probabilities (in contrast to the positions of the maxima) are not related by a
relatively simple growing function to the values of lengths of the corresponding
ideal knots.

What can be the possible applications resulting from the determination of the
optimal size of knots? For chemical cyclization of polymer chains we can use
linear polymer of a speciﬁc length and thus promote formation of a given type
of knot. Materials with interesting properties could be formed by this way.

limited to knots with up to 7 crossings since obtained by us, statistics for more
complex knots is less good.

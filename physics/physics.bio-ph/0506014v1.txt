Motivated by recent experiments on KIF1A, a representative member of single-headed kinesin
motor proteins family, we develop a theoretical model of intra-cellular transport by mutually inter-
acting molecular motors. The model explicitly accounts not only for the hydrolysis of ATP, but also
for the ratchet mechanism which is believed to drive each individual KIF1A motor. We study the
model by a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. A remarkable feature of this model
is that all the parameters in it can be completely evaluated from experimental data. Our results in
the dilute limit are in excellent quantitative agreement with the empirical data from single molecule
experiments. In the high density regime the predictions of the model also agree qualitatively with
the corresponding experimental observations. We derive a phase diagram that shows the inﬂuence
of hydrolysis and Langmuir kinetics on the collective spatio-temporal organization of the motors.
Finally, we provide experimental evidence for the existence of domain walls in our in-vitro exper-
iment with ﬂuorescently labeled KIF1A; these domain walls correspond to the shocks observed in
the density proﬁles of our theoretical model.

Intra-cellular transport of a wide variety of cargo in
eucaryotic cells is made possible by motor proteins, like
kinesin and dynein, which move on ﬁlamentary tracks
called microtubules (MT) [1, 2]. However, often a sin-
gle MT is used simultaneously by many motors and, in
such circumstances, the inter-motor interactions cannot
be ignored. Fundamental understanding of these col-
lective physical phenomena may also expose the causes
of motor-related diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease) [3]
thereby helping, possibly, also in their control and cure.
Some of the most recent theoretical models of interacting
molecular motors [4, 14, 15, 16] utilize the similarities be-
tween molecular motor traﬃc on MT and vehicular traﬃc
on highways [5] both of which can be modelled by appro-
priate extensions of driven diﬀusive lattice gases [6, 7].
In those models the motor is represented by a self-driven
particle and the dynamics of the model is essentially an
extension of that of the asymmetric simple exclusion pro-
cesses (ASEP) [6, 7] that includes Langmuir-like kinetics
of adsorption and desorption of the motors. In reality,
a motor protein is an enzyme whose mechanical move-
ment is loosely coupled with its biochemical cycle.
In
this letter we consider speciﬁcally the single-headed ki-
nesin motor, KIF1A [8, 9, 10, 11] which are believed to
move following a Brownian ratchet mechanism [12, 13].
In contrast to earlier models [4, 14, 15, 16] of molecular
motor traﬃc, which take into account only the mutual
interactions of the motors, our model explicitly incorpo-
rates also the Brownian ratchet mechanism of individual
KIF1A motors, including its biochemical cycle that in-
volves adenosine triphosphate(ATP) hydrolysis.

Despite the success of the simple ASEP-type models,
e.g. in explaining the occurance of shocks, they cannot

make detailed quantitative predictions. In this letter we
therefore address the problem of developing a theory of
KIF1A traﬃc that can be tested experimentally in a
quantitive way. In particular, in the low-density regime,
where inter-motor interactions are rare, predictions of
the proposed model are in excellent quantitative agree-
ment with the corresponding results obtained in labora-
tory experiments on single KIF1A motors. Moreover, the
spatio-temporal organization of the motors predicted by
the same model in the high-density limit is also in qual-
itative agreement with the corresponding experimental
observations.

The four states involved in each elementary cycle of
this cyclic nano-machine (Fig. 1) can be identiﬁed [8, 9]
as those of bare kinesin (K), kinesin bound with ATP
(KT), kinesin bound with the products of hydrolysis,
i.e., adenosine diphosphate(ADP) and phosphate (KDP),
and, ﬁnally, kinesin bound with ADP (KD) after releas-
ing phosphate. Both K and KT bind strongly to the MT.
KDP has a very short lifetime and the release of phos-
phate, i.e., transition from KDP to KD, triggers the de-
tachment of kinesin from MT; KD is weakly bound to the
MT and, therefore, executes Brownian motion along the
track. Finally, KD releases ADP when it steps forward
to the next binding site on the MT utilizing a Brownian
ratchet mechanism, and thereby returns to the state K.
Model deﬁnition. — A single protoﬁlament of MT is
modelled by a one-dimensional lattice of L sites each of
which corresponds to one KIF1A-binding site on the MT;
the lattice spacing is equivalent to 8 nm which is the sep-
aration between the successive binding sites on a MT [1].
Each kinesin is represented by a particle with two possi-
ble (internal) “chemical” states labelled by the indices 1

FIG. 2: A 3-state model for molecular motors moving along a
MT. 0 denotes an empty site, 1 is K or KT (strongly bound)
and 2 is KD (weakly bound). Transition from 1 to 2, which
corresponds to hydrolysis, occurs within a cell whereas move-
ment to the forward or backward cell occurs only when motor
is in state 2. At the minus and plus ends the probabilities are
diﬀerent from those in the bulk.

and 2 which capture the strongly bound and weakly bound
states of KIF1A, respectively. Moreover, attachment of a
motor to the MT occurs stochastically whenever a bind-
ing site on the latter is empty. However, attachment and
detachment at the two ends of the lattice need careful
treatment and will be speciﬁed below. Thus, each of the
lattice sites can be in one of three possible allowed states
(Fig. 2): empty (denoted by 0), occupied by a kinesin
in state 1 (strongly bound), or occupied by a kinesin in
state 2 (weakly bound).

For the dynamical evolution of the system, one of the
L sites is picked up randomly and updated according to
the rules given below together with the corresponding
probabilities (Fig. 2):

The ends of the MT protoﬁlament are known to take a
structural conformation diﬀerent from that in its middle
region, and the probabilities of detachment and attach-
ment at the two ends of the MT may be diﬀerent from
those at any bulk site. We choose α and δ, instead of ωa,
as the probabilities of attachment at the left and right
ends, respectively. Similarly, we take γ1 and β1, instead
of ωd, as probabilities of detachments at the two ends
(Fig. 2). Finally, γ2 and β2, instead of ωb, are the prob-

2

abilities of exit of the motors through the two ends by
random Brownian movements.

Let us relate the rate constants ωf , ωs and ωb with the
corresponding physical processes in the Brownian ratchet
mechanism of a single KIF1A motor. Suppose, just like
models of ﬂashing ratchets [12, 13], the motor “sees” a
time-dependent eﬀective potential which, over each bio-
chemical cycle, switches back and forth between (i) a
periodic but asymmetric sawtooth like form and (ii) a
constant. The rate constant ωh in our model corresponds
to the rate of the transition of the potential from form (i)
to the form (ii). The transition from (i) to (ii) happens
soon after ATP hydrolysis, while the transition from (ii)
to (i) happens when ATP attaches to a bare kinesin[8].
The rate constant ωb of the motor in state 2 captures
the Brownian motion of the free particle subjected to
the ﬂat potential (ii). The rate constants ωs and ωf are
proportional to the overlaps of the Gaussian probability
distribution of the free Brownian particle with, respec-
tively, the original well and the well immediately in front
of the original well of the sawtooth potential.

Let us denote the probabilities of ﬁnding a KIF1A
molecule in the states 1 and 2 at the lattice site i at time
t by the symbols ri and hi, respectively. In mean-ﬁeld
approximation the master equations for the dynamics of
motors in the bulk of the system are given by

The corresponding equations for the boundaries depend

that of those in state 1 as ωh increases beyond a certain

Single-molecule properties. — An important test for
the model is provided by a quantitative comparision of
the low density properties with empirical results. Single
molecule experiments [9] on KIF1A have established that
(i) v, the mean speed of the kinesins, is about 0.2 nm/ms
if the supply of ATP is suﬃcient, and that v decreases
with the lowering of ATP concentration following a
Michaelis-Menten type relation like (8);

(iii) τ , the mean duration of the movement of a kinesin

Moreover we have found that the position of the immo-
bile shock depends on the concentration of the motors as
well as that of ATP; the shock moves towards the minus
end of the MT with the increase of the concentration of
kinesin or ATP or both(Fig. 4).

Finally, we present direct experimental evidence that
support of the formation of the shock. The “comet-like
structure”, shown in the middle of Fig. 5, is the collec-
tive pattern formed by the red ﬂuorescent labelled ki-
nesins where a domain wall separates the low-density re-
gion from the high-density region. The position of the
domain wall depends on both ATP and KIF1A concen-
trations. Moreover, as we increase the concentration of
KIF1A, the transition from the regime of free ﬂow of ki-
nesins to the formation of the shock is observed(top and
middle in Fig. 5). Furthermore, we observe jammed traf-
ﬁc of kinesins at suﬃciently high concentration (bottom
in Fig. 5). The position of the shock in our simulation
agrees well with the location of the domain wall in the
comet-like structure observed in experiments[11].

In this letter we have developed a stochastic model for
the collective intra-cellular transport by KIF1A motors,
by taking into account the biochemical cycle of individual
motors involving ATP hydrolysis and their mutual steric
interactions. We have been able to identify the biolog-
ically relevant ranges of values of all the model param-
eters from the empirical data. In contrast to some ear-
lier oversimpliﬁed models, the predictions of our model
are in good quantitative agreement with the correspond-
ing experimental data. Moreover, we have mapped the
phase diagram of the model in a plane spanned by the
concentrations of ATP and KIF1A, both of which are
experimentally controllable quantities. Finally, we have
reported the experimental observation of a comet-like col-
lective pattern formed by the kinesin motors KIF1A and
identiﬁed the domain wall in the pattern with the shock
predicted by our model.

In this case the only

Even a small, but ﬁnite, rate ωh is suﬃcient to change
this scenario. In this case both the density proﬁles ρ(1)
and ρ(2)
of kinesins in the states 1 and 2 exhibit a shock.
As in the case of the ASEP-like models with Langmuir
kinetics [14, 15], these shocks are localized. In computer
simulations we have observed that the shocks in density
proﬁles of kinesins in the states 1 and 2 always appear
at the same position. This surprising behaviour can be
understood by using the usual arguments [17] that indi-
cate why ASEP-type models exhibit exactly one shock.
This argument applies to the total density ρj of motors.
If now the individual density proﬁles ρ(1)
exhibit
shocks these have to occur at the same location because
otherwise two shocks would exist in ρj = ρ(1)
[11].

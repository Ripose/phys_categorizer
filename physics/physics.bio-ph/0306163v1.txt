Abstract

We present a study of transport of a Brownian particle moving in periodic sym-
metric potential in the presence of asymmetric unbiased ﬂuctuations. The particle is
considered to move in a medium with periodic space dependent friction. By tuning
the parameters of the system, the direction of current exhibit reversals, both as a
function of temperature as well as the amplitude of rocking force. We found that
the mutual interplay between the opposite driving factors is the necessary term for
current reversals.

Key words: Current reversals, asymmetric unbiased ﬂuctuations, inhomogeneous
system.

1 Introduction

Recently, there has been increasing interest in studying the noise-induced
transport of Brownian particles for systems with a spatially periodic potential
ﬁeld. It has been shown that asymmetry of the potential (1)(2), the asym-
metry of the driving noise (3), and the input signal(4) are ingredients for the
transport. These subjects were motivated by the challenge to explain undirec-
tion of transport in biological systems, and several models have been proposed
to describe muscle’s contraction(5)(6)(7), or the asymmetric polymerization
of actin ﬁlaments responsible of cell motility(1).

Rectiﬁcation of noise leading to unidirectional motion in ratchet systems has
been an active ﬁeld of research over the last decade. In these systems directed

Brownian motion of particles is induced by nonequilibrium noise in the ab-
sence of any net macroscopic forces and potential gradients. Several physical
models have been proposed: rocking ratchets (8), fashing ratchets (9), diﬀusion
ratchets (10), correlation ratchets (11), etc. In all these studies the potential is
taken to be asymmetric in space. It has also been shown that one can obtain
unidirectional current in the presence of spatially asymmetric potentials. For
these nonequilibrium systems external random force should be time asymmet-
ric or the presence of space dependent mobility is required.

The study of current reversal phenomena has given rise to research activity on
its own. The motivation being possibility of new particle separation devices
superior to existing methods such as electrophoretic method for particles of
micrometer scale(12). It is known that current reversals in ratchet systems
can be engendered by changing various system parameters(13)(14), including
ﬂatness parameter of the noise(15), the correlation time of nonequilibrium
ﬂuctuations(16), the temperature in multinoise cases(17), the power spectrum
of the noise source(18), the shape of the potential(19), the number of interact-
ing particles per unit cell(20) and the mass of the particles(21). In this paper,
we study the current of a Brownian particle in periodic symmetric potential
in the presence of asymmetric unbiased ﬂuctuation and the inhomogeneous
friction and show when the current reversals occur.

2 The current in an inhomogeneous system

The Brownian dynamics of the overdamped particle moving under the inﬂu-
ence of a symmetric potential V0(x) and subject to a space dependent friction
coeﬃcient γ(x) and asymmetric unbiased ﬂuctuations at temperature T , is
described by the Langevin equation(11)

where ξ(t) is randomly ﬂuctuating Gaussian white noise with zero mean and
correlation: < ξ(t)ξ(t
). Here < ... > denotes an ensemble
average over the distribution of the ﬂuctuating forces ξ(t). The primes in the
Eq. (1) denote the derivative with respect to the space variable x. It should
be noted that the Eq. (1) involves a multiplicative noise with an additional
temperature dependent drift term. This term turns out to be important in
order for the system to approach the correct thermal equilibrium sate. We
take V0(x) = V0(x + 2nπ) = − sin(x), n being any natural integer. Also, we
take the friction coeﬃcient γ(x) to be periodic: γ(x) = γ0(1 − λ sin(x + φ)),
Where φ is the phase diﬀerent with respect to V0(x). The evolution of the

If F (t) changes very slowly, there exists a quasi-stationary state. In this case,
the average current of the particle can be solved by evaluating the constants
of integration under the normalization condition and the periodicity condition
of P (x), and the current can be obtained and expressed as

j(t) =

3 Results and Discussion

We have calculated the average current about the motion of the Brownian
particle in a periodic symmetric potential with the asymmetric unbiased ﬂuc-
tuations.

The average current J is plotted in Fig. 2 as a function of temperature T for
diﬀerent asymmetry parameters (ε is positive ). Here λ=0.9, γ0=0.1, F =0.5
and φ=1.3π. The ﬁgure shows that the average current is a peaked function
of the temperature. With increasing of intensity of the asymmetry parameter
the maximal current increases, but the corresponding temperature at which
the current takes the maximum is shifted to the lower temperature. For very
high temperature the current vanishes just like that of most o the thermal
ratchet models (1)(2)(3). It is obvious that no current reversals occur at the
case φ > π and ε > 0. In Fig. 3 we plotted the average current vs temperature
for diﬀerent asymmetry parameters (ε < 0). The other parameters is the same
as the Fig.2. From Fig. 3, we can see that when the asymmetry parameter is
negative the current reversal may occur (ε=-0.3, -0.5, -0.7) and the current
vanishes for lower temperature as well as higher temperature.

In Fig. 4, the plot of J versus F is shown for diﬀerent asymmetry parameters
(ε is positive), keeping λ, γ0, T and φ ﬁxed 0.9, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.3π respectively.
With increasing of the asymmetry parameters, the current increases. For very

depending on the value φ, as was previously shown for the adiabatic case
(14). In the absence of space dependent friction ratchets where the currents
saturate to zero in the same asymptotic regime. It is obvious that there are no
current reversals in the case φ > π, ε > 0. But the current reversals vs F may
occur (see Fig. 5) when the asymmetry parameters are negative (ε = −0.3,
ε = −0.5). In the present case (Fig. 5) ε is chosen so that the current goes

disappears. In the Fig. 7 the average current J is plotted vs F for φ=0.5π and
ε=0.3. The other parameters is the same as the Fig. 6. From the Fig. 7 we
can see that the current reversal vs F occurs at the case φ¡π,ε¿0. The current
saturates to a negative constant for large value of F which is similar to the
Fig. 4

When the ﬂuctuation is temporally asymmetric, its correlation properties in

either direction are diﬀerent, and a net current can arise even in the ab-
sence of a spatial asymmetry and a space dependent friction(22). The positive
asymmetric parameters induce a positive direction current while the nega-
tive parameters give a negative directional current. On the other hand, the
phase diﬀerence between the friction coeﬃcient and the symmetric potential
is sensitive to direction of the net current. Even in a symmetric potential and
symmetric ﬂuctuations(14) a net current can arise. The current tends to pos-
itive direction for ϕ > π and negative direction for 0 < φ < π. In fact, our
ratchet contains these two driving factor. It is found that the current reversals
may occur when a negative driving factor meets a positive driving factor: Case
A (ε < 0 and φ > π see Fig.3, Fig.5), Case B (ε > 0 and 0 < φ < π see Fig.6,
Fig.7), while no current reversals occur when the two negative (positive) driv-
ing factors meet: Case C (ε > 0 and φ > π see Fig. 2, Fig. 4), Case D (ε < 0
and 0 < φ < π).

In a word, in our symmetric potential ratchet, εφ < 0 is the necessary condition
for current reversals, the particle never changes its moving direction under the
condition of εφ > 0 and even no current occur under the condition of εφ = 0.

4 Summary and Conclusion

In present paper, the transport of a Brownian particle moving in spatially
symmetric potential in the presence of an asymmetric unbiased ﬂuctuation
is investigated. The current of the ratchet is discussed for diﬀerent cases.
We ﬁnd that the mutual interplay between the opposite driving factors is
the necessary term for current reversals. We ﬁnd current reversal, both as a
function of temperature as well as the amplitude of rocking force, when the
force is adiabatic and the potential is symmetry.

The phenomena of current reversals may be interest in biology, e. g., when
considering the motion of macromolecules. It is known that the two current
reversals eﬀect allows one pair of motor proteins to move simultaneously in
opposite directions along the microtubule inside the eucariotic cells.

To summarize, it is remarkable that the interplay of asymmetric unbiased ﬂuc-
tuation, in homogeneous friction and thermal noise with spatially symmetric
potential generates such a rich variety of cooperation eﬀects as up to current
reversals with temperature as well as the rocking forcing.

Abstract

We consider evolution of Boolean networks, and demonstrate how require-

ment of continuity in evolution may leads to punctuated equilibrium. We

discuss evolution of genetic ﬂexibility and how this may reconcile the expo-

nential distribution of species lifetimes seen by Van Valen with the power law

distribution of genera lifetimes obtained when one averages over the fossil

record.

Evolution of life is presumably a random process with selection [1]. It has been discussed

whether this process can be viewed as some hill climbing process [2], or whether evolution

mostly happens as a random walk where most changes have no inﬂuence on the phenotype,

and thus may be considered as neutral [3]. The case of evolution as adaptation in some

externally imposed ﬁtness landscapes have been originally proposed by Sewall Wright [2],

and later formed the basis for models of punctuated equilibrium by Newman [4] and Lande

[5]. The case for neutral evolution has been presented by Kimura [3], and is experimentally

supported on microlevel by observation of the many functionally identically variants there

are of most of the important macromolecules of life.

The observation of punctuated equilibrium in the fossil record, recently discussed by

Gould and Eldredge [6], may be taken as an indication that evolution of a species consists

of exaptations of jumping from one hill top to another nearby in some ﬁtness landscape.

Naturally such jumps will be rare, separated by large time intervals where species are located

at a ﬁtness peak, and the resulting evolutionary pattern will show punctuations as indeed

seen in the fossil record. This picture of single species evolution in a given ﬁxed landscape

has been modeled explicitly by Newman and Lande [4,5].

However, also neutral evolution may show punctuations: as, for example, might be

visualized by ﬁnding the exit in a labyrinth or from ﬁnding a golf hole by random walk in

a ﬂat landscape. The picture here is that genetic changes always take place, but that the

phenotypic changes only rarely occur. This has recently been demonstrated by modeling

the evolution of RNA secondary structure by P. Schuster and collaborators [7]. For these

molecules most base pair exchanges do not induce any changes in their secondary structure,

and thus they may be considered as neutral. Occasionally, however, one mutation may

suddenly lead to a complete readjustment of the structure, and presumably therefore to a

major change in its functionality.

In any case, as demonstrated by Bak and Sneppen [8], punctuated equilibrium on the

organism level might be connected to the episodic punctuations observed on the ecosys-

tem level. The crucial element of such an extrapolation is that the environment of each

2

species depends on species which are ecological neighbors, thereby allowing punctuations to

propagate across the ecosystem.

In the present paper we introduce a model of single species evolution without inter-species

competition. The evolutionary steps in the model consists of random mutations combined

with selection of mutants preserving the phenotype with respect to a given environment.

Thus, the only requirement is continuity in phenotype. Other changes in genotype are

allowed, creating a path of neutral mutations. We will discuss how this requirement of

continuity in evolution may constrain and guide the evolution of an individual species in the

face of a constantly changing environment.

Our fundamental constituents are the genes of the organism, and the evolution we con-

sider is on the genetic network level. Although genetic networks consist of biochemical

switches [9], it has been proposed that the on-oﬀ nature of these switches can be well

approximated by Boolean functions [10–12]. Thus we here consider networks of random

Boolean functions. The functionality we test for is attractors of these networks [11]. We

model continuity by testing for reaching a given attractor on subsequent steps, but allowing

changes that modify attractors that are not tested from the actual initial condition. In sub-

sequent steps, the initial condition (modeling the environment) assumes new random values

such that previous neutral mutations may then surface in the phenotype. The model may

be viewed as coarse grained in time, demanding continuity in fulﬁlling present demands on

a given environment, but opening for silent changes in how the organism may respond to

changed environments. We note that the continuity requirement also means that we only

evolve species for which at least one neighbour genotype has quite similar dynamics. Thus

our continuity requirement favours evolution of robust networks where changing of a few

rules does not leads to overall changes of expression.

In the simplest form we start the simulation by selecting a genetic network with N genes

and assign each a Boolean variable σi = −1 or 1. Further for each of the N genes we deﬁne

an updating matrix in the form of a lookup table which determines its output for each of

the 2N input states from the N genes in the system. Finally we deﬁne which gene is actively

3

connected to which, by a matrix wi,j that deﬁnes the input to state i from gene number j as

wi,jσj. The entry value of the connectivity matrix wi,j may take values −1, 0 and 1. A value

0 corresponds to no coupling from gene i to gene j, and is deﬁned to enter the updating

matrix by the entry value −1 always. Typically only a fraction of the connectivity matrix

entries are in use, and the average number of active inputs per gene is called the connectivity

K. It varies between 0 and N, meaning that K includes self couplings. Thus K = 0 means

that all is ﬁxed to the output state speciﬁed by input corresponding to (−1, ..., −1) to all

states.

Initially we start with a low but ﬁnite connectivity.

In the following, an initial

average connectivity of K = 1 coupling per site will be used.

Boolean networks can exhibit a rich dynamical behavior, including ﬁxed points, periodic

attractors and long transients to reach these. Further the number of attractors, their length,

and the length of the transients to reach these are known to depend strongly on the coordi-

nation number [13]. In this paper we do not address any questions connected with the time

scale of these attractors. Instead we consider a longer evolutionary time scale where the

geometry of the network may change. This reminds of evolutionary time scales of biological

species as compared with the much shorter lifetimes of organisms.

The evolutionary time step of the system is:

1. Select a random initial state of the system {σi}. Let your mother system evolve from

this state until a ﬁnal attractor is determined.

2. Create a daughter network by a) adding, b) removing, or c) adding and removing

a weight in the coupling matrix at random, each option occurring with probability

= 1/3. Let you daughter system evolve from the same initial state as that selected for

the mother and test whether it reaches the same attractor as the mother system did.

In case it does then replace mother with daughter network and go to step 3. In case

another attractor is reached, keep mother network and go to step 3.

3. Then ﬁnally one random bit of the total N ∗ 2N lookup table entries is ﬂipped to

4

another value. This allows for a convenient self averaging of the system, and in fact

represents a very slow change.

Iterating these steps makes an evolutionary algorithm that represents the sole require-

ment of continuity in evolution and how this may proceed under an environment that ﬂuctu-

ates. No selective pressure is applied. However, by not testing the entire basin structure of

the network we allow for silent mutations in the organism that may surface in a later changed

environment. In our model this new environment is represented by the new input vector

selected in the next time step. In practice this new environment may well represent either

physical changes in the environment or maybe changes in neighbor species in an ecosystem,

that we do not attempt to model here.

In ﬁgure 1a we show how the connectivity of this system evolves with time in a network

of size N = 16. One observes that the typical connectivity of the network is conﬁned to

lower values than for random networks. This is further quantiﬁed in Figure 2 where the

distributions of average connectivities are displayed in the statistically stationary state. All

data are taken beginning after an equilibration time of ten percent of the length of the total

run. Notice that there are two distributions, one counting the frequency of connectivities for

all new “species” and one counting the time averaged distribution of connectivities. These

two distributions diverge strongly for high connectivities because the few species with high

connectivity have very long lifetimes, i.e., it is very diﬃcult to ﬁnd mutations which do not

change the activity pattern of the networks completely. In our case, the activity pattern

consists of the transient and the ﬁnal periodic attractor following the given initial state. The

time scale of these patterns becomes large for networks with high connectivity, making it

more diﬃcult to keep the exact dynamic pattern under the mutation of a weight. In popular

terms, an increased complexity of the network makes further evolution diﬃcult. One may

speculate that this is the reason that real genetic networks keep connectivity low: It will

be easier to evolve by increasing the number of genes N at a fairly low connectivity level

(the present model, however, does not consider variable N). In Figure 1a we further see

5

that marked punctuations occur, where long periods of nearly ﬁxed average connectivity

sometimes are interrupted by a sudden change in connectivity. This interplay between

long waiting times and short times for actual changes is observed in the fossil record. The

phenomenon has been coined “punctuated equilibrium” by Gould and Eldredge. As also

seen from Figure 1b, the periods of stasis show a similar structure on shorter time scales

as they do on longer time scales. Thus the stasis time distribution may have long tails.

This is explored further in Figure 3a where we show this distribution averaged over the

simulation. Approximately the distribution of stasis times is ∝ 1/t2. Periods of stasis at

high values of the average connectivity can become very long, which in practice calls for

extremely long equilibration times. Thus, the simulation is mainly sensitive to a feasible

range of equilibration times limited by the duration of the run. The corresponding (left)

part of the stasis time distribution exhibits a smooth average.

In the right part of this

distribution, corresponding to long stasis times, sample to sample ﬂuctuations remain [14].

In Figure 3b we decompose the stasis time distribution into times obtained for diﬀerent

values of the average connectivity. Again we observe that higher connectivities typically

show longer stasis times. Remarkably, when looking at the statistics of a small interval of

low K values, we observe exponentially distributed stasis times. The power law behavior

then comes about by averaging over the range of all K values.

In order to test for the robustness of our model we tried other mutation rules (again

without any evolutionary pressure, i.e.

symmetric in adding and removing weights).

In

one variant a daughter network was created by a) adding or b) removing a weight in the

coupling matrix at random, each option occurring with probability = 1/2, thus allowing

for K-changing mutations only.

In another variant a daughter network was created by

independently adding a random weight with probability = 1/2 and removing a random

weight with probability = 1/2. The simulation results with these rules are identical to those

described above.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the meaning of the stasis times and punctuations observed here.

According to the deﬁnition of our model above, we quantify waiting times in terms of the

6

number of times mutant networks are exposed to new environments before a neutral mutation

occurs that fulﬁlls continuity. Thus they are not to be confused with the “neutral evolution”

introduced by Kimura [3] which leads to waiting times consisting of a number of neutral

mutations. Furthermore, Kimura’s model is deﬁned at the molecular level, whereas here

we consider evolution at the level of genetic networks. The genetic networks are formally

deﬁning a “species” and the length of the waiting times indicates the “genetic ﬂexibility” of

a species.

Associating the interconnectedness of our model networks with the genetic ﬂexibility

of real organisms one may attempt to understand a puzzling decomposition of lifetimes

of species in the fossil record. First it was noted by Van Valen [15] that each group of

closely related species have exponentially distributed lifetimes. Second, an analysis of the

overall distribution of genera lifetimes, tabulated by Raup and Sepkowski [16], showed that

this is rather distributed as ∝ 1/t2 [17] for genera lifetimes exceeding 15 million years. It

is tempting to speculate that groups of closely related species are associated to the same

genetic ﬂexibility, and thus may evolve, and eventually get extinct, with a frequency given

by this genetic ﬂexibility. This would explain the exponetial distribution of Van Valens.

Averaging over all genetic ﬂexibilities may then be an average over diﬀerent characteristic

lifetimes, and our simpliﬁed evolution scenario demonstrates how such an averaging can give

an overall 1/t2 distribution.

We note that the characteristic distribution of 1/t2 cannot be obtained on the basis

of ﬁtness landscapes alone, where one rather gets a distribution ∝ 1/t corresponding to a

sampling of passing times over a distribution of barriers [17].

In conclusion we have studied evolution of Boolean networks in absence of any com-

petition. This simpliﬁcation allowed us to discuss how the requirement of evolving robust

networks in itself may lead to an evolution which exhibits punctuated equilibrium.

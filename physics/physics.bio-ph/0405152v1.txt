Abstract

Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we study the migration of long charged
chains in an electrophoretic microchannel device consisting of an array of micro-
scopic entropic traps with alternating deep regions and narrow constrictions. Such
a device has been designed and fabricated recently by Han et al. for the separation
of DNA molecules (Science, 2000). Our simulation reproduces the experimental ob-
servation that the mobility increases with the length of the DNA. A detailed data
analysis allows to identify the reasons for this behavior. Two distinct mechanisms
contribute to slowing down shorter chains. One has been described earlier by Han
et al.: the chains are delayed at the entrance of the constriction and escape with a
rate that increases with chain length. The other, actually dominating mechanism is
here reported for the ﬁrst time: Some chains diﬀuse out of their main path into the
corners of the box, where they remain trapped for a long time. The probability that
this happens increases with the diﬀusion constant, i. e., the inverse chain length.

1 Introduction

Electrophoresis is the standard method of DNA separation by length (Viovy,
2000). Since the mobility of DNA molecules in free solution is independent
of their length, the DNA is commonly introduced into a gel, which serves as
a random sieve. Unfortunately, the eﬃciency of gel electrophoresis decreases
with the length of the DNA. Moreover, bioanalytic devices are more and more
miniaturized, and incorporating random gels with characteristic pore sizes in
the nanometer range into future nanodevices will presumably become increas-
ingly problematic. Therefore, much recent eﬀort has been devoted to designing
and making well-deﬁned microstructured devices for DNA separation (e. g.,

Han et al., 1999; 2000; 2002; Bader et al., 1999; Hammond et al., 2000; Duong
et al., 2003).

In this paper, we focus on a geometry proposed by Han and coworkers (Han
et al., 1999), which is based on the idea of entropic trapping. The DNA is in-
troduced into a small microchannel with alternating deep regions and shallow
constrictions. The channel thickness in the constrictions is much smaller than
the radius of gyration of the DNA molecules. The deep region is large enough
to accommodate the equilibrium shape of the DNA molecules. Entering the
constrictions is thus entropically penalized, and the deep regions can be in-
terpreted as entropic traps. A schematic cartoon of the structure is shown in
Fig. 1.

In these structures, Han et al. made the counterintuitive observation that long
DNA molecules travel faster than short molecules. They explained their ﬁnd-
ing by means of a simple kinetic model. In order to escape from one of the deep
regions, the DNA must overcome an activation barrier ∆Fc. The escape pro-
cess is initiated by a thermally activated stretching of a chain portion (length
x) into the shallow constriction. This costs entropic penalty proportional to x,

depends solely on the electric ﬁeld, ∆Fc ∝
1/τ0, increases with the chain size, since the amount of polymer in contact
with the constriction is larger for larger chains. The mean trapping time in
this simple model is given by

τ = τ0 exp(∆Fc/kBT ),

where T is the temperature and kB the Boltzmann factor. This implies that
long chains travel faster.

The results of Han et al. have motivated recent Monte Carlo simulations by

2

Tessier et al. (2002). These authors used the Bond ﬂuctuation model, a well-
known lattice model for polymers, to study the mobility of polymers in a
geometry similar to that suggested by Han et al. within local Monte Carlo
dynamics (single monomer moves). Their results conﬁrm the trapping picture
of Han et al., and even details of the kinetic model. For example, they present
evidence that the penetration depth x of the chain into the constriction can be
1/E.
used as a “reaction coordinate” for escaping, with a critical value xc ∝
When looking more closely at the simulation data, one notices that the trap-
ping in the system of Tessier et al. is unexpectedly strong. Although the width
of the constriction is more than twice as large as in the experiments (in units
of the persistence length), the molecules spend almost the entire time in a
trapped state, and very little time traveling, even at intermediate ﬁelds. This
eﬀect might be an artifact of the lattice model. We note that the width of
the constriction in the simulations is just 10 lattice constants, while every
monomer occupies a cube with 8 lattice sites, and the average bond length
is 2.8 lattice constants. Moreover, the Monte Carlo dynamics is not realistic.
Monomers are picked and moved randomly (with some moves being rejected),
whereas in the real system, they are pulled into the constriction by the electric
force. Dynamic Monte Carlo is known to reproduce diﬀusional and relaxational
dynamics in systems near local equilibrium. Nevertheless, it is not clear how
well it can be applied to study driven systems. The details of the dynamics
should matter particularly at higher electric ﬁelds, in situations where the
chains travel so fast that they no longer reach local equilibrium in the traps.
Therefore, simulations of oﬀ-lattice models with a more realistic dynamical
evolution are clearly desirable.

As a ﬁrst step in this direction, Chen and Escobedo (2003) have recently
studied the free energy landscape of chains in a single, non-periodic trap with
Monte Carlo simulations of an (oﬀ-lattice) bead-spring model. The initial con-
ﬁguration in these simulations is that of a fully relaxed chain in the absence of
an electric ﬁeld. With that starting point, the free energy barrier ∆F turns out
to depend on the chain length for short chains, and to level oﬀ at higher chain
lengths. The data for ∆F do not seem to support the relation ∆F
1/E.
Since the simulations still used Monte Carlo, the results on dynamical prop-
erties were limited.

∝

In the present paper, we present Brownian dynamics simulations of a full
(non-equilibrium) periodic array of entropic traps. We employ a Rouse-chain
model, such as has been successfully used by others to study the migration of
DNA in various geometries (Deutsch, 1987; 1988; Matsumoto, 1994; Noguchi,
2001). Our main result is the observation of a new trapping mechanism in
geometries such as Fig. 1, which is at least as important as that suggested by
Han et al., and which can also be exploited to achieve molecular separation.
The insight gained from our study should be useful for the design of future,

improved molecular separation devices.

The paper is organized as follows: in the next section, we describe and discuss
the model and give some technical details on the simulation. The results are
presented in section 3. We summarize and conclude in section 4.

The spring constant was chosen very large, k = 100kBT /σ2, in order to prevent
chain crossings.

The molecule is conﬁned in a structured channel with a geometry similar to
that used by Han et al.. The thickness of the shallow constrictions and thick
regions is ts = 7σ and tl = 80σ, respectively, the length of a deep region is 80
σ, and the total length of a period is L = 100σ. In the lateral direction, the
channel is inﬁnite. The chain beads are repelled from the walls of the channel
by means of a wall potential essentially identical to (2), VW all(r) = Vpair(r),
where r is the distance of a bead to the closest wall point 1 . The details of the
wall potential do not inﬂuence the results, as long as it is repulsive and short
ranged. Note that the eﬀective width of the channel, i. e., the width of the
space accessible to a bead, is reduced by 2σ with this potential. A snapshot
of a chain in such a channel is shown in Fig. 2.

DNA is a charged polyelectrolyte with 2e− per base pair, thus each bead carries
a charge q and is subject to an electric ﬁeld E =
Φ. We assume that the
charges do not interact with one another. This will be discussed further below.
The distribution of the electric potential Φ(r) in the channel was calculated
numerically by solving the Laplace equation (∆Φ = 0) with von Neumann

with α, β = x, y or z. The random noise and the friction mimics the eﬀect
of the solvent surrounding the DNA. The chains diﬀer from standard Rouse
chains (Doi, 1986) by their excluded volume interactions and by the inertia
m of the beads. With the parameters of our model (m = 1.ζ 2σ2/kBT , see the
discussion further below), the chains exhibit Rouse dynamics on length scales
of the order the gyration radius of the chain, Rg (Streek, 2002).

Several important physical factors are neglected in the model. First, electro-
static interactions within DNA chains are not taken into account. This is
justiﬁed by the fact that the Debye screening length in typical electrophoresis
buﬀers is only a few nm, comparable to the diameter of the double helix. Sec-
ond, we do not consider electro-osmotic ﬂow, or ﬂow in general. This reﬂects
the experimental situation reported by Han et al.. Third, hydrodynamic inter-
actions are disregarded. This is partly justiﬁed by the theoretical observation

5

that for polyelectrolytes dragged by an electric ﬁeld, the hydrodynamic inter-
actions should be screened over distances larger than the Debye length, since
the counterions are dragged in the opposite direction (Viovy, 2000). Unfortu-
nately, the argument is only strictly valid as long as no non-electric forces are
present (Long, 1996). In our case, the walls of the channels exert non-electrical
forces which stop the polymers, but do not prevent the counterions in the De-
bye layer from moving. Thus the chains experience an additional trapping
force from the friction of the counterions. This eﬀect is disregarded in our
model. Furthermore, diﬀusion is not treated correctly even in free solution.
The diﬀusion constant of Rouse chains scales as 1/N with the chain length N.
Including hydrodynamic interactions, one expects Zimm scaling 1/Rg, where
N 3/5 for self-avoiding chains. Experi-
the gyration radius Rg scales like Rg ∝
mentally, the diﬀusion constant of DNA in typical buﬀer solutions is found to
scale as 1/N 0.672 (Stellwagen, 2003).

Unfortunately, a full treatment which accounts correctly both for the (dynami-
cally varying) counterion distribution as well as the hydrodynamic interactions
is not feasible with standard computational resources. The simpliﬁcations of
our model inﬂuence the results quantitatively, but do presumably not change
them by orders of magnitude. The qualitative behavior should not be aﬀected.

Keeping these caveats in mind, we can now proceed to establish a quantitative
connection with the experimental setup of Han et al.. The natural units in our
(the charge per bead), and T (the
model are related to the parameters σ, ζ,
temperature). More speciﬁcally, the energy unit is ǫ = kBT , the length unit is
σ, the time unit is t0 = ζσ2/kBT , and the electric ﬁeld unit is E0 = kBT /σ

Since the experiments are carried out at room temperature, the energy unit
10−21J. The length unit is obtained from matching the
is ǫ
persistence length of the model chains, lp = 1.6σ (Streek, 2002) with that of
DNA, lp = 45nm, yielding σ
30nm. The persistence of the chain is also used
to determine the number of base pairs (bp) per bead. A DNA molecule contains
approximately 150 bp on a stretch of length lp. In our model, the average bond
length between two beads is 0.847σ (Streek, 2002), thus we have 1.9 beads per
persistence length, and one bead represents roughly 80 bp. The elongation for
a chain crossing with minimal energy is rcross
1.198σ, which corresponds
to an energy barrier ∆Ecross
82E0 for crossing. The Boltzmann-factor for
this energy barrier turns out to be less than 10−35. To check the simulation
program, the bond length distribution was compared to the Boltzmann-factor
and very good agreement was found. Furthermore, no bond ever exceeded a
length of 1.1σ. Thus no chain crossing occured in our simulations.

Finally, the unit of the electric ﬁeld can be identiﬁed from matching the mo-
bility µ0 of free chains. The theoretical value is µ0 =
/ζ = σ/t0E0. In
experiments, the mobility depends strongly on the choice of the buﬀer. Un-
fortunately, Han et al. do not report explicit measurements of the free-chain
mobility of DNA in the buﬀer used in their experiments. In the microchan-
nel, they observe that the overall mobility saturates at high ﬁeld strengths.
The apparent maximum mobility µmax results from an average over a slow
motion in the reduced electric ﬁeld of the deep regions, and a fast motion in
the enhanced electric ﬁeld of the constrictions (see Fig. 2). For large periods
L
tl, ts, the ratio of these two ﬁeld strengths is simply the inverse of the
thickness ratio α = tl/ts. One can then derive a relation between the true free
chain mobility µ0 and the apparent mobility µmax:

keep in mind that the electric ﬁeld in the channel is not homogeneous (see
Fig. 2). In our geometry, the electric ﬁeld in the constriction is enhanced by a
1.8,
factor of 2.5. In the experimental setup, the enhancement factor is only
due to the fact that the length ratio between the shallow and deep regions
is diﬀerent (50:50 in the experiment, 20:80 in the simulations). The ratio of
ﬁeld strengths in the shallow and deep regions in our simulations is roughly

The remaining model parameter that has yet to be determined is the mass m
of a bead. We note that the actual value of the mass has no inﬂuence on the
static properties of the chain (e. g., the chain ﬂexibility), nor on the diﬀusive
part of the dynamics. It does, however, determine the relative importance of
vibrational modes in the chain and other inertia eﬀects. The latter can be
characterized by the electrophoretic relaxation time τe, i. e., the characteristic
decay time of the drift velocity of free ﬂow DNA, if the electric ﬁeld is suddenly

our model, the electrophoretic relaxation time is τe = m/ζ, and the correct

value of the mass would be m

from a computational point of view, because the mean velocity per bead,
2kBT /m, becomes large for such small bead masses, and the time
h
step has to be chosen short as a consequence. The simulation becomes very

ineﬃcient. On the other hand, we are not interested in inertia eﬀects here,
and we wish to study dynamical eﬀects on much longer time scales than t0.
Therefore, we chose to give the beads an unphysically high mass, m = 1ζt0,
10−6s. On time scales
leading to an electrophoretic relaxation time τe = t0
t0 and less, the dynamics will thus be unrealistic, but this does not aﬀect the
slow diﬀusive dynamics.

We close this section with a few technical remarks. The dynamic equations (4)
were integrated using the Verlet algorithm. The stochastic noise was realized
by picking in every time step a vector η at random. D¨unweg and Paul (1991)

8

have shown that the distribution of random numbers in such a procedure does
not necessarily have to be Gaussian. Here, we used a uniform distribution in
a sphere. Since we consider single chains only, no periodic boundaries were
necessary. With the mass m = 1ζt0, the time step could be chosen 0.01 t0.
Typical run lengths were between 4 and 20 million t0 (5-25 seconds). The sim-
ulation jobs were managed by the Condor Software Program (Condor), which
was developed by the Condor Team at the Computer Science Department of
the University of Wisconsin (Condor, 2003).

3 Results and Discussion

Three examples of trajectories at the average ﬁeld E = 0.005E0 are shown
in Fig. 3. They reveal three qualitatively diﬀerent modes of migration. The
trajectory of very short chains (N = 10 corresponding to 800 bp) is dominated
by diﬀusion. The chains wander back and forth in the trap, until they even-
tually escape into the next trap. The movement of chains with intermediate
chain length (N = 100 or 8 kbp) is much more directional, but still irregu-
lar. They are often trapped at the entrance of constrictions. In contrast, long
chains (N = 1000 or 80 kbp) travel smoothly. The ﬁrst (leading) monomer
is sometimes trapped, but this does not arrest the rest of the chain. Whereas
the time spent in one box ﬂuctuates strongly for shorter chains, it is roughly
constant for large chains.

The behavior of intermediate chains (N = 100) has similarity to that observed
in the simulations of Tessier et al. (2002). However, the trapping is much less
pronounced in our case, and chains frequently pass from one box to another
without being trapped at all. Trapping eﬀects comparable to those reported
by Tessier et al. were only observed at the lowest ﬁeld strength, E = 0.0025E0.
At that ﬁeld value, chains of all lengths got trapped. As we shall see below,
however, chain separation turned out to be not eﬃcient for such small ﬁelds.

We have carried out simulations for seven diﬀerent chain lengths N = 10, 20,
50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000, and for ﬁve average ﬁeld values, E/E0 = 0.0025,
0.005, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04. The resulting mobilities, determined as µ =
/E,
are summarized in Fig. 4. For all ﬁelds except the lowest, the mobility increases
steadily with the chain length. At high chain lengths and high ﬁelds, it begins
to saturate. The maximum value µmax is only about half as large as the free
chain mobility µ0, due to the fact that the chains spend a disproportionate
amount of time in the deep regions, where the local electric ﬁeld is lower than
average.

At the lowest ﬁeld (E = 0.0025E0), the mobility depends only slightly on
the chain length and even decreases with chain length for small N. At such

small ﬁelds, backwards diﬀusion becomes important for short chains. We have
seen in Fig. 3 that short chains explore the whole trap. At E = 0.0025E0,
they sometimes even travel backwards into the trap that they just left. The
conformational entropic penalty for entering the constrictions is small for short
chains. In the limit E
0, the inverse mobility is thus simply proportional
to the number of times the chain visits the entrance of the constriction. Since
the latter scales like N (the inverse diﬀusion constant D−1), the mobility is
then expected to decrease with chain length. In our system, this is observed
at E = 0.0025E0 for chain lengths smaller than N = 100. For N > 100, the
mobility increases again with chain length. The resulting overall chain length
dependence is small, and the chain separation is not eﬃcient.

We will now investigate the migration modes in more detail. To this end, we
have calculated histograms of the retention times spent in one trap. They were
deﬁned as the diﬀerence tn+1
tn of the times tn when the ﬁrst monomer of
a chain ﬁrst enters the deep region of the nth trap. Fig. 6 shows distributions

Beyond the maximum, the distribution decays rapidly for long chains (N =
1000), and much more slowly for short chains (N = 10), following an exponen-
tial behavior. This is consistent with the common picture, where the migration
is determined by one single escape rate 1/τ . The histogram for intermediate
chain length N = 100, however, reveals that the situation is more complex in

Fig. 3. The ﬁgure suggests that there exist two qualitatively diﬀerent ways
how chains pass from one trap to another: Either they travel relatively straight
and unimpeded, or they get trapped and linger for some time at the border
of the constriction.

The trapping mechanism suggested by Han et al. alone cannot explain these
observations. Here we propose an additional trapping mechanism, which also
slows down short chains and which presumably accounts to a large extent for
the chain length dependence of the mobility observed in our simulations. The

idea is that chains get trapped at the side walls and corners of the deep boxes
due to diﬀusion. The electric ﬁeld lines lead the chains from the outlet of one
constriction directly to the entrance of the next one. With a certain probability,
the chain will therefore reach the next constriction without detours, and then
get delayed there due to the mechanism suggested by Han et al.. This accounts
for the fast time scale τfast. On the other hand, chains may also diﬀuse out of
the main path. They may access regions of the trap at the walls and in the
corners where the electric ﬁeld is very small. In that case, they are caught in
a force-free region, and they can “escape” only by diﬀusion.

We will now explore whether our data support this picture. In the following
analysis, only data for chain lengths N
0.005E0 were used.

In most of these systems two time scales τ were observed. The value of the fast
time scale τfast could be extracted by ﬁtting an exponential (A exp(
t/τfast))
to the initial decay of the histogram H(t). The determination of the slow
time scale was much more diﬃcult, due to the poor statistics for the late
time tails of the histograms. We used two approaches: First we ﬁtted the long
range tail with an exponential function to obtain a rough estimate. Assuming

We checked whether the result deviated strongly from the previous estimate,
and whether it depended strongly on the cutoﬀ tcut. If this was the case,
(because the data for H(t) scattered strongly), the result was discarded. The
remaining values are compiled in Fig. 7, together with the data for τfast.

If our suspicion is correct that the fast process corresponds to the mechanism
of Han et al., then the rate 1/τfast should be proportional to the amount of
polymer in contact with the channel. Since the channel entrance is essentially
one dimensional, the contact area should be proportional to the gyration radius
Rg of the chain. Fig. 7 shows that the fast time scale indeed scales like τfast
1/Rg ∝
The relation between τfast and the electric ﬁeld strength E is more complicated.
According to Han et al., the chains must overcome a free energy barrier of
height proportional to 1/E in order to escape. On the other hand, the prefactor
τ0 in Eq. (1) may also depend on E. The resulting E-dependence can be rather
complex. In the ﬁeld range of our simulation, the resulting relation τfast(E) can
be approximated by the empirical law τfast

E−1.55.

Like the fast time scale τfast, the slow time scale τslow also decreases with the
chain length, but the dependence here is very weak. Unfortunately, the quality

of the data was not suﬃcient for a quantitative analysis. If our interpretation
is correct, then τslow characterizes an escape from a low-force region. We note
that extended chains in a corner experience a net electric force towards the
wall, even though the ﬁeld lines of course never enter the wall (see Fig. 8).
In order to leave the corner, the chain must either move against the force,
or change its shape. In both cases, it has to overcome a free energy barrier
before it can get rescued from the ﬁeld lines. A simple Ansatz would predict
the escape probability to be proportional to the diﬀusion constant D

Thus the slow time scale τslow itself does not contribute much to the chain
length dependence of the mobility. The main eﬀect comes from the fact that
the relative number of chains caught in the ﬁeld-free region depends on the
chain length. The travel time from one channel to the next for undeﬂected
chains is slightly smaller than tmax = L/Eµmax. We assume that chains have
to diﬀuse at least over a distance z0 into the ﬁeld-free region (direction

We can test this prediction under the assumption that the two time scales τfast
and τslow are suﬃciently far apart that they can be separated. In that case,
one can choose a time tcut such that almost all undeﬂected chains have left the
trap, while almost all deﬂected chains are still in the ﬁeld-free region. P can
then be approximated by the relative number P0 of chains left in the ﬁeld-free

These considerations establish the existence of a new mechanism which pro-
duces chain length dependent mobility. To assess the relative importance of
the new mechanism, we compare the real mobility data, Fig. (4), with a very
simple model. Chains either travel straight across the trap, or get sidetracked
into the ﬁeld-free region. Traveling across the trap takes at least the time
tmax = LE/µmax. The chains caught in the ﬁeld-free region spend an ad-
ditional time τslow in the trap. We make the simpliﬁcation that Eτslow is in-
dependent of the chain length and electric ﬁeld and given by the number
Eτslow = 400 t0E0, which is roughly the value at chain length
100 and ﬁeld
0.02 E0. The relative number of chains caught in the deep

4 Summary and Outlook

To summarize, we have presented the ﬁrst oﬀ-lattice Brownian dynamics sim-
ulation of DNA migration in an entropic trap array. We reproduce the ex-
perimentally observed phenomenon that the mobility increases with the chain
length. This result can be traced back to two distinct mechanisms. The ﬁrst
mechanism has already been discussed by Han et al.: Chains get delayed at
the narrow channels connecting the traps. They escape through the channels
with a probability which is proportional to the radius of gyration of the chain
and thus scales as N 3/5. However, we found that this eﬀect accounts only
in part for the total chain length dependence. In the second mechanism, the
chains are trapped with a certain probability at the side and in the corner
of the box. The characteristic time for escaping such a conﬁguration is very
long. The trapping probability increases with the diﬀusion constant, which is
in turn inversely proportional to the chain length. As a result, the mobility
increases with the chain length.

To our best knowledge, this mechanism has not yet been described in the
literature. It becomes relevant when the period L of the structure is small.
Indeed, Han et al. have studied structures with periods ranging from 4 to 40
µm (Han, 1999), but they reported separation by length only for their smallest
structure with L = 4µm, in a system with dimensions comparable to those
studied here.

We have observed a number of other phenomena, which we shall not describe
in detail here. In contrast to Chen et al. (Chen, 2003), we have considered truly
non-equilibrium systems. Subsequent escapes cannot necessarily be considered
as independent events. The longest chains N = 1000 do not recover the equi-
librium coil structure in the middle of the trap, but they remain stretched in
the x direction. Moreover, our data seem to provide evidence that chains even
retain some memory of the previous escape process. At high ﬁelds, successive
escape times seem to be correlated. Unfortunately, the statistical quality of
the data is not good enough to allow for a more thorough analysis.

The situation becomes even more complicated when the shallow channel is
made wider. Whereas in the cases presented here, long chains migrated faster
than short chains, we have observed the inverse eﬀect in microﬂuidic system
with wider channels (Duong, 2003). The eﬀect as well as other, even more
unexpected phenomena, can be reproduced in simulations. These phenomena
will be presented in a forthcoming publication (Streek, 2004).

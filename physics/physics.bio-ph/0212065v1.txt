We present a novel method for predicting protein secondary structure using single sequence. Most

existing methods predict each position based on either single residue or a local window character. In order

to overcome the shortcomings of these methods, we develope a new method predicting protein secondary

structure by amino acid pair speciﬁc proﬁles. For the test set of Rost and Sander’s nonhomologous

proteins, the three state residue-by-residue accuracy is 73.4% , 10 percent higher than the GOR III

method.

1 Introduction

Methods for the prediction of secondary structure from amino acid sequence have developed for more than

30 years. In 1974, Chou and Fasman[1, 2] published their method using a combination of rules and amino

acid preference parameters. Their method was a single residue prediction method. The position speciﬁc

information of residues was neglected. Based on statistical information and information theory Gibrat

developed the GOR[3] method. The protein sequence is analysed by a 17 residues window sliding along

the length of the sequence. Diﬀerent methods are applied in protein secondary structure prediction such

as discriminant analysis, neural-network and nearest-neighbor algorithms, etc. There are also methods that

combine characteristics and principles from several of these categories. But the method using single sequence

is the basis of these methods.

Amino acid has diﬀerent property according to its environment. The same peptide segment may fold

into either helix or sheet conformation. A resolution to this problem is using amino acid proﬁles for diﬀerent

conformations. The GOR method is based on this idea with the assumption that amino acids ﬂanking the

central amino acid residue inﬂuence the secondary structure that the central residue is likely to adopt. After

GOR VI[4] was published , most methods included amino acid pair information. But, to most of them,

the contribution of residue pair was too simpliﬁed because the property of an amino acid pair is diﬀerent

according to its environment too. The secondary structure of an amino acid pair is inﬂuenced by residues

Based on this idea, we develope a new method predicting protein secondary structure by amino acid pair

surrounding them.

speciﬁc proﬁles.

2 Learning set

It is reported that the homologous relationship can not be determined by alignment for two protein sequences

if their amino acid identical is no more than 35%.

In order to get amino acid property excluding the

homologous information, we use a nonredundant set of globular protein structure. This database is based

on the list of PDB SELECT [5] with the amino acid identical less than 25% published on September,2001

(ftp://ftp.embl-heidelberg.de/pub/databases/protein_extras/pdb_select/old/2001_sep.25).

The secondary structure assignments are taken to be those provided by DSSP [6]database. The protein

secondary structure is rewrote as H

This database contains 1612 globular protein chains, 268031 residues totally. There are 94415 residues

as h, 56510 residues as e, and 117106 residues as c. For the learning set, the minimum length of helix and

sheet is 3 and 2 respectively. As there are only 20

20 categories of amino acid pair, the sample size is big

enough to get the probability distribution of our model.

3 Amino acid pair speciﬁc proﬁle and its character

Amino acid proﬁle contains much more information than single peptide. It is good to characterize a l-length

polypeptide segment in speciﬁcal conformation. But, it is not a residue speciﬁc method. So, it can not tell

the diﬀerence whenever the preference for particular position is not obvious. The protein secondary structure

prediction is this kind of question. To overcome this shortcoming, we introduce an idea of amino acid pair

speciﬁc proﬁle which means for speciﬁcal positions in this proﬁle the amino acid pair are given.

For example, there is a 16 length proﬁle. At position 7 and 10, the amino acid is speciﬁc, where ’a,b’

means amino acid, ’s,t’ means secondary structure conformation of amino acid ’a,b’ . Then, there are 400

such proﬁles totally without considering the diﬀerence of conformations. For our database, the sample size of

the following secondary structure pair is big enough to get the probability distribution of its corresponding

amino acid pair speciﬁc proﬁle:cc, ee, hh, ce, ec, ch and hc.

To ﬁnd the suitable proﬁle length, we compare the signal of amino acid pair speciﬁc proﬁle with a random

model. For an amino acid pair ab in st conformation, the sample size of the proﬁle is S(ab, st). To compare

the signal of proﬁle (ab, st) with a random process, we select S(ab, st) amino acids randomly from learning

set and get the amino acid probability distribution for this time of random sample process. The random

sample process is carried out 25 times. Then, we calculate the Kullback-Leibler distance [16, 17, 18] between

the probability distribution pi

learning set by

In the next step, we want to ﬁnd the suitable positions of amino acid pair in the proﬁles. The two

speciﬁc amino acids in the proﬁle can be separated by 0, 1, 2, 3, and n amino acids. The question is which

is the best. In order to answer this question, we compare the signal of proﬁle (ab, st, n) with proﬁle (st, n).

5 Prediction of protein secondary structure

For diﬀerent ab and st, the Fp(ab, st) and Fn(ab, st) curve is diﬀerent. We get the threshold for each kind of

ab and st with the Fp(ab, st) = 0.05 which means only 5 percents of false signal’s score I(st; ab, w) are above

the threshold T (ab, st).

changed according to the position of ’d’ and ’c’.

If there is a proﬁle ’wab’ with neighbors ’wbd’ on the right and ’wca’ on the left. ’wbd’ and ’wca’ can be

profile wca:

. . . . . . c . a . . . . . . .

secondary structure of ca:

s

In the ﬁrst step, score I(st; ab, wab) is ﬁltered in the following rules:

if I(st; ab, wab) > T (ab, st) then l1 = 1

On the right, for any d, u, if there is at least one proﬁle such that I(tu; bd, wbd) > T (bd, tu), then l2 = 1

On the left, for any c, r, if there is at least one proﬁle such that I(rs; ca, wca) > T (ca, rs), then l3 = 1

If l1, l2, l3 equal 1 simultaneously, amino acid pair ab may be in st conformation with a great possibility. As

score I(st; ab, wab) is assured, we name score I(st; ab, wab) as assured island.

After this ﬁlter step, each assured island is expanded in both direction one step on condition that:

if I(st; ab, wab) is assured island

for any d, u, if I(tu; bd, wbd) > T (bd, tu), then I(tu; bd, wbd) is named as assured island.

for any c, r, if I(rs; ca, wca) > T (ca, rs), then I(rs; ca, wca) is named as assured island.

Once we get the assured islands, the scores of single amino acid for diﬀerent secondary structure confor-

mation is assigned by

(19)

where I(st; ab, wab), I(rs; ca, wca) is assured island. This means the information of amino acid a in s

conformation equals the information of assured island minus the contribution of the other amino acid in the

pair. Then, the secondary structure of a is predicted in the conformational state for which the score I ′(s; a)

is the highest.

For regions where there are no assured island, the secondary structure can not be predicted. In order to

ﬁll these regions up, each predicted secondary structure segment is expanded in both directions one residue

at each step on condition that the amino acid preference factor of Chou-Fasman is bigger than 0.9.

The ﬁnial step is ﬁlter. Each single residue secondary structure segment is discarded. The secondary

structure segment ’hh’ is expanded in both directions one residue at each step on condition that the amino

acid preference factor of Chou-Fasman for helix is bigger than 0.7. Each residue which can not be predicted

by our method is assigned as conformation ’c’.

6 Accuracy of prediction

The method is tested on the representative database of Rost and Sander’s[9] 124 nonhomologous proteins

(set 1). The secondary structure of the test set is assigned by the DSSP program. Two protein sequences are

excluded from the initinal 126 data set (subunits A and B of hemagglutinin 3hmg), which were designated

as a membrane protein according to the SCOP[19] classiﬁcation. For assessing single-residue accuracy,

several performance measures are used: the percentage of correct residue predictions(Q3),Sensitivity(Sn)

and Speciﬁcity(Sp). A comparison of prediction results using our method with results using SSP[12, 13]

method, SSPAL[14] method and PHD[9, 10, 11] method tested on the same data set are shown in table 1.

The Q3 accuracy for this test set achieves 73.4%, 10 percent higher than the GOR III method.

There is intersection between the learning set and set 1. The intersection is found based on the list of

HSSP[7] database which is derived by homologous information. After excluding this intersection, there are

81 peptide chains(set 2). This subset is independent of the learning set. The Q3 accuracy for this subset is

71.2% slightly lower than the original one.

8

Single-residue accuracy measures sometimes poorly reﬂect the actual prediction of secondary structure.

For example, assigning coil state to all amino acids in the protein 4sgb gave Q3=76.7 percent, but this

protein has several missed β-structures. The segment prediction accuracy can be estimated by a simple

measure comparable to that proposed by Taylor[15]: The structure is considered correctly predicted if it has

at least two amino acids in common with the real one. The segment prediction accuracy for short and long

helix and sheet conformation compared with results of SSP method are shown in table 2.

7 Discussion

In the above, we have developed a novel method for protein secondary structure prediction. The present

method works very well. The accuracy is the best in methods using single sequence. It works as well as the

SSPAL method which is based on nearest-neighbor and using homology information. After fully development,

it may achieve much better accuracy and become a powerful tool for protein secondary structure prediction.

We estimate density of defects frozen into a biological Turing pattern which was
turned on at a ﬁnite rate. A self-locking of gene expression in individual cells, which
makes the Turing transition discontinuous, stabilizes the pattern together with its
defects. A defect-free pattern can be obtained by spatially inhomogeneous activation
of the genes.

Motivation and summary of results

Long time ago Turing pointed out [1] that simple reaction-diﬀusion (RD) systems of equations can account for
formation of biological patterns. The mainstream of research, as reviewed in Ref. [2], is devoted to RD models in
continuous space. The continuum RD-patterns are smooth and nonpermanent. On the other hand, it is an empirical
fact that even the nearest neighbor cells can diﬀer sharply in their biological functions and their sets of expressed
genes. Moreover many biological patterns are permanent. Even the most primitive viruses, like the much studied
bacteriophage λ [3], possess genetic switches that discriminate between diﬀerent developmental pathways and make
a once chosen pathway permanent.
It is reasonable to assume that cells of higher organisms can also lock their
distinctive sets of expressed genes.

The Turing patterns on ﬁgures in the review [2] are contaminated with defects. If we insist on pattern permanence,
we must accept that patterns are permanent together with their defects. Sometimes, like for the animal coat patterns,
permanent defects can provide an animal with its own characteristic life-long but not inheritable ”ﬁngerprints”. In
other cases, like formation of vital organ structures, a single defect can be fatal. In this situation it is important to
understand better the origin of defects.

In this paper we use a simple toy model which in principle should give a homogeneous Turing pattern. Defects
are particularly manifest on such a simple background. The model has two genes A and B. The genes are strong
mutual repressors. The strong intracellular mutual inhibition is the factor responsible for pattern permanence. Both
genes are activated simultaneously in a given cell when a level of their common activator a exceeds its critical value
ac. Pattern formation in RD models of Ref. [2] was simulated with ﬁxed model parameters. In this paper we turn on
the activator level a at a ﬁnite rate to ﬁnd a scaling relation between density of defects and the rate. Strong mutual
intracellular inhibition stabilizes the pattern together with its defects. We obtain permanent domains of A-phase and
domains of B-phase divided by sharp cell-size boundaries.

We also show that an inhomogeneous activation of the genes can result in a perfect defect-free homogeneous pattern.
At ﬁrst the activator a exceeds ac in a small seed area where, say, the gene A is chosen. Then a slowly spreads around
gradually activating more and more cells. The initial choice of A is imposed via intercellular coupling on all newly
activated cells. The inhomogeneous activation can be suﬃciently characterized by a velocity v with which the critical
a = ac surface spreads. Thanks to the strong mutual intracellular inhibition there is a nonzero threshold velocity vc,
such that for v < vc the formation of defects is completely suppressed. In this way the very mutual inhibition which
is responsible for stability of defects can be harnessed to get rid of them.

The genetic network that we use in our toy model is functionally equivalent to the genetic toggle switch which was
syntetized by the authors of the recent paper [4]. In that paper the network is studied experimentally in a single
”cell”. It would be interesting to generalize the experiment to a ”multicellular” structure.

For the sake of deﬁniteness we take a genetic network with two genes A and B. A and B are mutual repressors. The
network is symmetric under exchange A ↔ B. Expression of both genes is initiated by a common activator a. Let
A(t, ~x) and B(t, ~x) denote time-dependent protein concentrations in the cell at the position ~x. ~x belongs to a discrete

diﬀerential equations

˙B(t, ~x) = R SB(t, ~x) − B(t, ~x) .

The last terms in these equations are responsible for the protein degradation. R is a transcription rate. SA,B(t, ~x) ∈
{0, 1} are dichotomic stochastic processes. They switch on (0 → 1) and oﬀ (1 → 0) transcription of a given gene.
For simplicity the processes are assumed to have the same constant switch-oﬀ rate roﬀ . The switch-on rates depend
on concentrations

W, V are positive coupling constants, a(t) is a concentration of the activator. F [z] is a smooth step-like sigmoidal
function; the function F [z] = 103 exp(z − 2.2)/[1 + exp(z − 2.2)] was used in our numerical simulations. In this model
the genes A and B are mutual repressors (W > 0). There is a ”ferromagnetic” coupling between nearest-neighbor
cells (V > 0); expression of A in a given cell enhances expression of A in its nearest neighbors.

The model is motivated by a genetic switch between two mutual repressors like the one studied in the phage λ [3]
and in the E. coli switch [4]. The mutual repressors have a common promoter site on DNA. A necessary condition for
expression of any of them is a binding of an activator molecule to their promoter site [5]. The concentrations A and
B inﬂuence its aﬃnity to the promoter site. The gene expression is intermittent because of binding and unbinding of
activator molecules. The nearest-neighbor coupling is possible thanks to signalling through intercellular membrane
channels.

In an adiabatic limit, when switching of SA,B is much faster than protein expression and degradation, the processes

SA,B can be replaced by their time averages,

where 2d is the number of nearest neighbors in d dimensions.

The RHS’s of these equations deﬁne a velocity ﬁeld on the A − B plane, which is not a gradient ﬁeld. The
velocity ﬁeld has attractor structure which depends on the activator level a. There are two critical activator levels
ac1 < ac2. For a < ac1 there is one attractor at [A, B] = [γ(a), γ(a)] with an increasing function γ(a). In the range
ac1 < a < ac2 there are three attractors: the old [γ(a), γ(a)] plus a new symmetric pair of [α(a), β(a)] and [β(a), α(a)]
with α(a) > β(a). For ac2 < a there remain only the two broken symmetry attractors [α(a), β(a)] and [β(a), α(a)].
The functions α(a), β(a) and γ(a) are plotted in Fig.1.

If we start in the [A, B] = [0, 0] state and slowly increase a-level, the system will stay in the γγ-phase until we
reach a = ac2. At a = a+
c2 the system will roll into αβ or βα-phase. On the other hand, if we start from ac2 < a with
the system in, say, αβ-phase, then we will have to decrease a down to a = ac1, where αβ becomes unstable towards
the symmetric γγ-phase. The discontinuous jumps of the concentrations are illustrated in Fig.1. This hysteresis loop
is characteristic for ﬁrst order phase transitions. In the adiabatic limit, where ﬂuctuations are small, there are no
short cuts via bubble nucleation. When ac1 (ac2) is approached from above (below), the correlation length of small
ﬂuctuations around this uniform state diverges like in a continuous phase transition. The critical regime is narrow in
the adiabatic limit so we can rely on the mean ﬁeld approximation.

A ﬁnite rate Turing transition

Let us think again about starting from [A, B] = [0, 0] and continuously increasing a(t) above ac2 . At a+

c2 the γγ
state becomes unstable and the system has to choose between the αβ and βα attractors. If a(t) is increased at a
ﬁnite rate, then there are ﬁnite correlated domains which make the choice independently. Despite divergence of the
c2, the critical slowing down results in a certain ﬁnite correlation length ˆξ ”frozen” into the
correlation length at a−
ﬂuctuations. This scale deﬁnes density of defects in the Turing pattern. This eﬀect is well known in cosmology and
condensed matter physics as Kibble-Zurek scenario [6]. In those contexts the defects disappear rapidly as a result
of phase ordering kinetics. We will see that in our gene network model the defect pattern is permanent. This eﬀect
results from a combination of the histeresis loop and the discreteness of the cell lattice.

To be more quantitative we substitute A(t, ~x) = γ(a(t)) + δA(t, ~x) and B(t, ~x) = γ(a(t)) + δB(t, ~x) into Eqs.(5)
and linearize them in δA, δB. The linearized equations can be diagonalized by φ = δA − δB and ψ = δA + δB. After
Fourier transformation in space

φ(t, ~x) =Z ddk ˜φ(t, ~k) ei~k~x

they become

˙φ(t, ~k) = Rsφ(t, ~k) +

we used the shorthands F (′)
a = F (′)[(−W + 2dV )γ(a(t))]. Rsφ,ψ are noises which result from ﬂuctuations in RSA,B.
In the adiabatic limit they can be approximated by white noises (both in space and in time) with small magnitude.
The next step is to linearize a(t) around its critical value a(t) = ac2 + t/τ , where τ is the transition rate. This

linearization gives

(14)

Here we used the identity c0[W + 2dV ] = 1, which has to be satisﬁed because, by deﬁnition, φ(t,~0) is a zero mode
at ac2. The ψ modes are stable for any ~k. The φ-modes in the neighborhood of ~k = ~0 become unstable for t > 0 (or
ac2 < a). Eq.(13) is a standard linearized Landau model with the symmetry breaking parameter (c1/c0)(t/τ ) changing
sign at t = 0. The length scale ˆξ frozen into ﬂuctuations at t > 0 can be estimated following the classic argument
given by Zurek [6]. For t < 0 the model (13) has an instantaneous relaxation time c0τ /c1|t| and an instantaneous

correlation length c0pV τ /c1|t|. They both diverge at t = 0−. The ﬂuctuations can no longer follow the increasing

a(t) when their relaxation time becomes equal to the time still remaining to the transition at a = ac2, c0τ /c1|t| ≈ |t|.
At this instant the correlation length is

This scale determines the typical size of the αβ- and βα-domains. The scaling relation ˆξ ∼ τ 1/4 was veriﬁed by
numerical simulations illustrated at ﬁgures 2 and 3. The domain structures generated in the simulations turned out
to be permanent.

The domain structures are permanent because already at ac2 the width of the domain wall interpolating between
αβ and βα is less then the cell size (lattice spacing). The nearest neighbor cells across the wall express diﬀerent genes.
The width (the healing length) is determined by the longest length scale of ﬂuctuations around the αβ- or βα-state.
These correlation lengths are plotted in Fig.4. For a ≥ ac2 they are substantially less than 1. In the adiabatic limit,
where the noises are weak, the domain wall cannot evolve because it would have to overcome a prohibitive potential
barrier. On a cellular level the barrier originates from the mutual inhibition between A and B in a single cell. Roughly
speaking, much above ac1 each cell is locked in its gene expression state and insensitive to its nearest neighbors’ states.

Inhomogeneous activation

The intracellular mutual inhibition stabilizes the Turing pattern but it also stabilizes the defects frozen into the
pattern. With the ˆξ ∼ τ 1/4 scaling the number of defects is rather weakly dependent on τ . There may be not enough
time during morphogenesis to get rid of the defects by simply increasing τ . However, it is possible to generate a
defect-free pattern by spatially inhomogeneous switching of the activator level a. For example, its concentration can
exceed ac2 at one point at ﬁrst, where the cells happen to pick (or are forced to pick), say, αβ-phase, and then the
activator can gradually spread around so that the initial seed of αβ-cells gradually imposes their choice on the whole
system. For continuous transitions this eﬀect was described in Ref.( [7]).

The eﬀect of defect suppression in inhomogeneous activation can be most easily studied in a one dimensional version
of the model (1). Suppose that a smooth activator front is moving across the one dimensional chain of cells with a
velocity v, a(t, x) ≈ ac2 + (vt − x)/vτ close to x = vt where a = ac2. For deﬁniteness we impose two asymptotic
conditions: for vt ≪ x ( where a < ac2 ) the cells are in the γγ-state, and for x ≪ vt (where a > ac2) they are in
αβ-phase. We can expect that as the a-front moves to the right it is followed by the αβ front gradually entering the
area formerly occupied by the γγ-phase. If the concentration front is fast enough to move in step with the activator
front, then the αβ-phase will gradually ﬁll the whole system. If, on the other hand, the concentration front is slower
than the activator front then the front of the αβ-phase will lag behind the a = ac2 front. The gap between the two
fronts will grow with time. The gap will be ﬁlled with the unstable γγ-phase (a > ac2 behind the a-front). When
the gap becomes wide enough, then γγ-state will be able to decay towards the βα-state. A domain of βα-phase
will eventually be nucleated behind the a-front. Now the βα-domain will grow behind the a-front until its front lags
suﬃciently behind so that a new domain of αβ-phase will be nucleated. In this way the activator front will leave
behind a landscape of alternating αβ- and βα-domains qualitatively the same as for homogeneous activation.

The success of the inhomogeneous activation depends on the relation between the velocity v of the a-front and that
of the concentration front. As illustrated in Fig.4 ﬂuctuations around the αβ-state have two families of modes each
with a diﬀerent correlation length. For any a each ~k-mode within each family has a diﬀerent diﬀusion velocity: a ratio
of its wavelength to its relaxation time. The lowest of these diﬀusion velocities, vc(a), is the maximal velocity at which
the αβ-phase can spread into the area occupied by the γγ-phase. vc(ac2) ≡ vc2 > 0 because at a = ac2 the αβ-state is
stable (the hysteresis loop again!). vc(a) increases with an increasing a. If v < vc2 the αβ-front moves in step with the
a-front; its tail spreads into the vt < x area imposing an αβ-bias on the ﬂuctuations around γγ-state. The αβ-phase
spreads without nucleation of any βα-domains. For v < vc2 a defect-free uniform Turing pattern forms behind the
activator front. Results from numerical simulations of the inhomogeneous activation are presented in Fig.5.

More complicated patterns

Finally, it is time to comment on more complicated models which are expected to give more complicated patterns
than the (in principle) uniform pattern discussed so far. Let us pick a zebra pattern for example. For the uniform
pattern the ﬁrst mode to become unstable in Eq.(13) is the ~k = ~0 mode. The ﬁnal pattern has an admixture of
~k’s in a range ≈ ˆξ−1 around ~k = ~0. In distinction, for the zebra pattern the ﬁrst unstable modes are those on the
circle |~k| = 2π/L, where L is the spacing between zebra stripes. The ﬁnal pattern has an admixture of ~k’s in a ring
of thickness ≈ ˆξ−1 around the circle |~k| = 2π/L, compare results for Swift-Hohenberg equation in Ref. [8]. This

4

admixture results in defects frozen into zebra pattern. The inhomogeneous activation can be applied in the zebra case
too. In addition it can be used to arrange the stripes. An activator spreading from an initial point would result (at
least close to the initial point) in concentric black and white rings. A front of activator moving through the system
would comb the stripes perpendicular to the front.

Diﬀerent Particle Sizes Obtained from Static and
Dynamic Laser Light Scattering

Yong Sun

January 21, 2014

Abstract

Detailed investigation of static and dynamic laser light scattering has
been attempted in this work both theoretically and experimentally based
on dilute water dispersions of two diﬀerent homogenous spherical particles,
polystyrene latexes and poly(N -isopropylacrylamide) microgels. When
Rayleigh-Gans-Debye approximation is valid, a new radius Rs, referred to
as static radius, can be obtained from the static light scattering (SLS).
The size information obtained from SLS is purely related to the optical
properties of particles, i.e., to Rs and its distribution G (Rs). The size
information obtained from dynamic light scattering (DLS) is more com-
plicated, the size distribution of which is a composite distribution that is
not only related to the optical properties of particles, but also related to
the hydrodynamic properties and the scattering vector. Strictly speaking,
an apparent hydrodynamic radius Rh is a composite size obtained from
averaging the term exp
in the static size distribution G (Rs),
with the weight R6
sP (q, Rs) that is also a function of both Rs and the
scattering vector q. Based on our argument, the dimensionless shape
parameter
/Rh, which is obtained from the combination of SLS
and DLS and is frequently used for the judgement of the conformation of
macromolecules or nanoparticles, can not provide a unambiguous descrip-
tion for the particle shape.

For colloidal dispersion systems, the light scattering is a widely used tech-
nique to measure the sizes of particles. Developed during the last few decades,
the standard methods of the inverse Laplace transformation and Cumulant are
used to obtain the apparent hydrodynamic radius Rh and its distribution of par-
ticles from the normalized time auto-correlation function of the intensity of the
scattered light g(2) (τ ) [1
5] with the assistance of the Einstein-Stokes relation.
The treatment of the static light scattering (SLS) spectroscopy is simpliﬁed to
the Zimm plot, Berry plot or Guinier plot etc. to get the root mean-square
and the molecular mass of particles provided that
radius of gyration
the particle sizes are small[4, 6, 7]. In order to obtain more accurate information
about the particles, people have explored the relations between the physical
quantities obtained by using SLS and dynamic light scattering (DLS) tech-
niques. People think that the measurement of the dimensionless shape param-

/Rh can provide a relatively unambiguous test for the particle

The standard DLS techniques are not suited to accurately detect the poly-
dispersities of less than about 10%. Pusey and van Megen[9] proposed a method
to detect small poly-dispersities when the Rayleigh-Gans-Debye (RGD) approx-
imation is valid, by measuring the dependence of the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃ-
cient obtained from the initial slope of the correlation function with respect
to the scattering angle. By deﬁnition, the eﬀective diﬀusion coeﬃcient is a
intensity-weighted average diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Meanwhile, when the standard
method of Cumulant is used, from the ﬁtted results of our samples, the values
of second moment µ2 can have large diﬀerences even if the experimental data
were measured under the totally same conditions. More importantly, the ﬁtted
values of µ2 often are negative. It is a big contradiction with it’s deﬁnition and
let the second moment µ2 lose it’s physical meaning.

How to obtain the size distributions of particles from the SLS data has
been researched by a few authors[10, 11].
In general, people think that the
radius obtained by using the SLS technique is the same as that obtained by
using the DLS technique if the eﬀects of the diﬀerent weight of particle sizes
and the scattering vector are considered. From our analysis, a new radius can
be obtained from the SLS data, namely static radius Rs. For simplicity, in
this paper, the homogenous spherical particles are considered and the RGD
approximation is thought to be valid. The static light-scattering intensity of a
dilute non-interacting poly-disperse system in unit volume can be obtained for
vertically polarized light.

Two standard polystyrene latex samples from Interfacial Dynamics Corpo-
ration were used in SLS and DLS measurements. One is the sulfate white
polystyrene latex with normalized mean diameter of 67 nm and the other is
the surfactant-free sulfate white polystyrene latex of 110 nm, as are shown in
Table 1. All values were provided by supplier as obtained by using Transmission
10−5
Electron Microscopy (T EM ) technique. The Latex 1 was diluted to 1.02
10−5. The solvent is the fresh de-ionized
and Latex 2 was diluted to 1.58
water from a Milli-Q Plus water puriﬁcation system (Millipore, Bedford, with
a 0.2 µm ﬁlter). Because the sizes of polystyrene latex particles are small and
the refractive index diﬀerence between the polystyrene latex and the milli-Q
water (refractive index 1.332) is large, the m-1 is 0.19 and the “phase shift”
4π
[4, 12] is equal to 0.21 if the sample Latex 2 is considered and the
λ R
refractive index 1.591 of polystyrene at 590 nm , 20oC is used, so the mono-
is used to obtain the approximate values
disperse model G (Rs) = δ
of the mean static radii Rs for the two commercial polystyrene latex samples
respectively. The commercial values of the mean radii and standard deviations
of the two samples shown in Table 1 were input Eq. 1 to get Is/Iinc respectively.
In order to compare with the experimental data, the calculated and experimen-
tal values at q = 0.01887 were set equal. Figure 1.a shows the results of sample
Latex 1. In order to check the calculated values with experimental values of
R2
, the commercial values of the mean radii and standard deviations also

were input Eq. 3 respectively to obtain the expected root mean-square radii of

. Meanwhile the root mean-square radii of gyration were mea-
sured by using the Zimm plot respectively. Figure 1.b shows the ﬁtted results

of sample Latex 1, KC/R = 1.29
standard polystyrene latex samples were measured under the same conditions
as the SLS data respectively and the hydrodynamic radii were obtained by us-
ing the Cumulant method. In order to conveniently compare with the values
calculated by using the size information obtained from the SLS data and avoid
the contradictions of µ2, the values of hydrodynamic radii were obtained by
using the ﬁrst Cumulant. For the two standard polystyrene latex samples, the
values of hydrodynamic radii at scattering angle 40o were chosen as the results
obtained by using the DLS technique. All results are listed in Table 1.

The results show that the ﬁtted results’ errors and χ2 decrease and the mean
static radius Rs and standard deviation σ approximates constant values when
the ﬁtting scattering vector range is enlarged. If this range continues to increase,
the values of the mean static radius and standard deviation begin to change and
χ2 is becoming large. This is the results of the deviation between the real and
′s minimum.
theoretical light scattering intensity in the vicinity of the Is/Iinc
This minimum lies at about the scattering vector 0.0207 nm−1. In this range,
most of the scattered light is cancelled due to the light interference. So many
other character of particles can show the eﬀect on the light scattering inten-
sity, for example: the particle number distribution deviates from the Gaussian
distribution, the particle shape deviates from a perfect sphere, the density of
particles deviates from the homogeneity and the light scattered intensity from

By using the standard method of Cumulant, the hydrodynamic radii can be
obtained at diﬀerent scattering angles from g(2) (τ ) measured under the same
conditions as the SLS data. The values of hydrodynamic radii are related to the
scattering angle. The value is about 280 nm. Now by using the light scattering
techniques, diﬀerent particle sizes for a same particle system can be obtained.
This diﬀerence will not only aﬀect the analysis of the physical quantities that
are related to the particle sizes, but also, very importantly, it will bring one

4

fundamental question: which size information is the better approximation of
the real system? For the two commercial polystyrene latex samples, the value
obtained by using the SLS technique is consistent with that measured by using
TEM technique. The eﬀect brought by this diﬀerence to the standard method
of Cumulant also can be analyzed. From the process that g(2)(τ ) is obtained, it
is determined by both the optical and hydrodynamic features of particles. If the
normalized time auto-correlation function of the electric ﬁeld of the scattered
light g(1)(τ ) is written out in detail for the homogeneous spherical particles by
using the ﬁrst Cumulant, the following equation can be obtained.

g(1) (τ ) is determined by both the optical and hydrodynamic features of particles

system, equation g(1) (τ ) = exp
is a very good method to obtain the
hydrodynamic sizes of particles. When the distributions of particles need to be
obtained, exactly the distribution obtained by using the Cumulant method is a
composite distribution G(q, Rh, f ). Here f represents the relation between the
hydrodynamic radius Rh and the static radius Rs. For narrow distributions,
we ever simply assumed that the relation between the static and hydrodynamic
radii is a = Rh/Rs. Here a is a constant. With the size information obtained
by using the SLS technique, the expected values of hydrodynamic radii can be
obtained by using Eq. 5. The same PNIPAM microgel sample was measured at

Our results show that the diﬀerence between the static and hydrodynamic
radii can not be totally explained by the eﬀects of the diﬀerent weight of particle
sizes and the scattering angle. For other samples, we have got the same conclu-
sion. The static and hydrodynamic radii are diﬀerent physical quantities. Even
for the mono-disperse model, the hydrodynamic radius still represents the hy-
drodynamic properties and the static radius shows the optical character of par-
ticles. In real systems, the particles deviate from the Stokes approximation. For
example: the dangling chains of the microgels, the H-bond interaction between
the water molecules and the segments of PNIPAM microgels and the rotation of
microgels etc. The deviations will show the eﬀect on the friction force and make
the apparent hydrodynamic radius Rh big when the Einstein-Stokes relation is

used to get Rh. From the deﬁnition of

the Rg is only related to the static radius. The ratio of Rg/Rs is 0.775 for
homogenous spherical particles and the dimensionless shape parameter Rg/Rh
will be less than 0.775. The values of Rg/Rh should be aﬀected by the surface

Comparing the SLS technique with the DLS technique, the simple particle
size Rs and size distributions G (Rs) of dilute homogenous spherical particles
can be directly obtained by using Eq. 1. And the distribution obtained by using
the DLS technique is a composite distribution G (q, Rh,f ) , the apparent hydro-
dynamic radius is a composite size obtained from the average of exp
in
distribution G (Rs) with the weight R6
sP (q, Rs). The values of apparent hydro-
dynamic radii also are aﬀected by the structure of particles and the interaction
between the solute and solvent. The simple sizes and distributions obtained by
using the SLS technique are the physical quantities that people really want to
get from the experimental data. They let us avoid the other parameters’ eﬀect
when the size information is used to analyze other physical quantities.

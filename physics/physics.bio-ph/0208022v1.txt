A simulation study of the dynamics of a driven
ﬁlament in an Aristotelian ﬂuid

Abstract

We describe a method, based on techniques used in molecular dy-
namics, for simulating the inertialess dynamics of an elastic ﬁlament
immersed in a ﬂuid. The model is used to study the ”one-armed swim-
mer”. That is, a ﬂexible appendage externally perturbed at one ex-
tremity. For small amplitude motion our simulations conﬁrm theoret-
ical predictions that, for a ﬁlament of given length and stiﬀness, there
is a driving frequency that is optimal for both speed and eﬃciency.
However, we ﬁnd that to calculate absolute values of the swimming
speed we need to slightly modify existing theoretical approaches. For
the more realistic case of large amplitude motion we ﬁnd that while
the basic picture remains the same, the dependence of the swimming
speed on both frequency and amplitude is substantially modiﬁed. For
realistic amplitudes we show that the one armed swimmer is compar-
atively neither ineﬃcient nor slow. This begs the question, why are
there little or no one armed swimmers in nature?

Introduction

For a class of biologically important polymeric materials elasticity is crucial.
Their typical lengths (microns or less) are comparable with the scale on
which rigidity prevents them from collapsing. The cytoskeletal ﬁlaments
actin and microtubules [1] fall in this category, as do cilia and ﬂagella. The
latter are motile assemblies of microtubules and other proteins. Because of
their size and typical velocities, the motion of these ﬁlaments is nearly always

in the low Reynolds number regime. This is an inertialess, Aristotelian,
world where the dynamics of a surrounding ﬂuid become time-reversible.
As a notable consequence, it is diﬃcult to generate any propulsion on this
scale [4]. Nonetheless, cytoskeletal ﬁlaments are involved in cellular and
microorganism motility. Perhaps the most widely known example is that
of the ﬂagellum of a sperm cell, that enables it to swim along the ovaric
tubes. The internal drive of a ﬂagellum, however, is rather complicated [2].
It involves many internal degrees of freedom and active components. On
the other hand, modern micromanipulation techniques, such as optical and
magnetic trapping, open up the possibility of perturbing otherwise passive
ﬁlaments with a simpliﬁed and controlled drive. This provides a potentially
useful model system for which one may study the fundamentals of motility.

apply a controlled drive to a inert ﬁlament.

It is this problem we concern ourselves with here. Speciﬁcally, we con-
sider the ﬂexible one-armed swimmer. That is, an elastic ﬁlament that is
wiggled at one end. If the ﬁlament were rigid, the reversible motion of the
surrounding ﬂuid would ensure that this mechanism generates no propulsion
(the “scallop theorem” as Purcell termed it). However, the ﬂexibility of the
arm breaks the time reversal symmetry for the motion of the assemblage.
This makes propulsion, in principle, possible. For any microscopic ﬁlament
the factors that determine its dynamic behavior are the same. Namely, the
equations of motion will be essentially inertialess. The motion itself will be
determined by a balance between forces driving the ﬁlament, friction forces
exerted as the surrounding ﬂuid opposes any motion, and bending forces that
try to restore the (straight) equilibrium state. For relatively simple model
systems, there has recently been theoretical progress in solving analytically
the “hyperdiﬀusion” equation that, in the limit of small amplitude motion,
describes the movement of such a ﬁlament. Wiggins and Goldstein [6] con-

2

sidered the motion of a single ﬁlament driven at one end by an external
perturbation. Their analysis emphasized that there are two very diﬀerent
regimes; one where bending forces dominate and the ﬁlament behaves like
a rigid rod, and a second where the viscous damping of the ﬂuid has the
eﬀect of suppressing the propagation of elastic waves. For the one armed
swimmer, this leads to an optimal set of parameters that maximize either
the swimming speed or swimming eﬃciency. The same analysis gives predic-
tions for the shape of such a wiggled ﬁlament that can be compared with the
response observed in a micro-manipulation experiment [5]. By comparing
experimental results with theory, structural properties of the ﬁlament were
inferred.

Wiggins and Goldstein consider the ﬂexible one armed swimmer in the
limit of small amplitude motion. With the assumption of inertialess dynam-
ics, one can derive the following equation [6] [8] [10] for the function h(s, t),
describing the displacement of the ﬁlament from the horizontal axis as a
function of time t and arclength s.

ξ⊥∂th =

Here ξ⊥ determines the viscous force, treated as simply a transverse vis-
cous drag and k the stiﬀness of the ﬁlament. This “hyperdiﬀusion” equation
has to be solved subject to appropriate boundary conditions (corresponding
to diﬀerent forms of external driving). Simple active driving mechanisms
could be an oscillating constraint on the end position, or an oscillatory
torque applied at one extremity. The former can be regarded as the sim-
plest example of what has been called elastohydrodynamics as it involves the
balance of viscous and elastic forces. The latter is a more plausible biological
mechanism as it involves no net external force. Both these mechanisms are
considered by Wiggins and Goldstein and we also consider both here.

To summarize the predictions of the theory, for a given amplitude of
driving the remaining parameters can be grouped together to deﬁne a di-
mensionless “Sperm number”,

Sp =

l4ωξ⊥

where l is the length of the ﬁlament and ω the wiggling frequency.

This characterizes the relative magnitudes of the viscous and bending
forces. A low value implies that bending forces dominate, a high value
viscous forces. As a function of the Sperm number, the theory predicts

- The swimming speed and eﬃciency (deﬁned as the amount of energy
consumed, relative to the amount of energy required to simply drag a
passive ﬁlament through the ﬂuid at the same velocity), go to zero as
Sp goes to zero. This is the stiﬀ limit where the motion is reversible
and the scallop theorem applies

- At a sperm number Sp

4 there is a maximum in the both the swim-

ming speed and eﬃciency (although not at exactly the same value)

≃

- At high sperm numbers a plateau region where the speed and eﬃciency

become independent of Sp, albeit at values lower than the peak.

In this paper we describe a numerical model that allows us to simulate
such a driven ﬁlament. With the model we can calculate the dynamics, free
from restrictions such as small amplitude motion, and with greater scope to
specify the type of active forces driving the motion and the boundary con-
ditions applicable for a given physical situation. With such a model, we can
test theoretical predictions and also study more complex problems where no
analytic solution is available. Here we do both. Looking at small amplitude
motion we compare with the theory. Moving on to large amplitude motion
we establish to what extent the small amplitude approximation limits the
theory.

2 Model and Simulation

Our model solves the equations of motion of a discretized elastic ﬁlament
immersed in a low Reynolds number ﬂuid. Any form of internal and external
forcing can be imposed but we restrict ourselves here to an active force,
acting on one extremity, that is periodic in time. The hydrodynamics is
kept to the approximation of slender body ﬂow [3], where the local velocity-
force relation is reduced to a simple expression in terms of friction coeﬃcients
that are shape and position independent. They do nonetheless reﬂect the
diﬀerence between friction transverse and longitudinal to the ﬁlament. For
the problems we are concerned with here the planar driving forces produce
planar motions. The model would apply equally well were this not to be the
case.

Considering a continuous description of the ﬁlament in space and time,
one can specify this at any given instant t by a curve r(s, t), giving a point
in space for any value of the arclength parameter s (ﬁgure 2).

To describe the dynamics we need the local forces acting on the ﬁlament.
The latter are related to the energy of the model system. Speciﬁcally, we
have

Here, following slender-body theory, the eﬀect of the surrounding ﬂuid
is taken as a drag force that is proportional and opposite to the local
velocity. This is anisotropic due to the elongated shape of the ﬁla-
ment. This requires the presence of a longitudinal drag coeﬃcient ξk
associated with the projector ˆtˆt along the tangent vector t, together
with a transverse coeﬃcient ξ⊥ acting along the normal vector n.

Accordingly, one obtains two equations of motion, one for the evolution of
the ﬁlament shape, and the other for the tension force τ (s, t), that enforces
locally the inextensibility constraint. Expressing the curve shape as the
angle ψ(s, t) that its local tangent forms with a ﬁxed ˆx direction, one can
write these equations as (see [8]):

The two nonlinear equations above have then to be solved subject to
appropriate boundary conditions. For example, no external forces and
torques for a free tail. For the wiggling problems we examine here, the
non-equilibrium drive (oscillating end position or torque) is, in these terms,
simply a time-dependent boundary condition. Through a functional expan-
sion about the obvious solution for zero drive ψ0(s, t) = 0, τ0(s, t) = 0,

it is straightforward to obtain, to second order in ǫ the (decoupled) equations

the transverse and longitudinal “absolute” displacements u(s, t) and h(s, t)
from the direction ˆx of the ﬁlament’s resting position, one gets to equation 1
for the time evolution of h to second order in ǫ.

−

In the simulations we use a particle model to solve equations 5 and 6
numerically using an approach similar to molecular dynamics. Time is dis-
cretized and the ﬁlament is described as a set of n point particles rigidly con-
nected by n
1 “links”. The interaction between the particles is constructed
so as to reproduce the appropriate collective behavior. For convenience in
implementing the algorithm, we do not simulate the over-damped motion,
given by equation 4 directly. This would correspond to the zero mass case.
Rather, we solve the damped Newton equation for an object with “small”
total mass m. By making the mass small enough we can reproduce the
required inertia-less mass independent behavior [14].

This leads to the identiﬁcation A = k
∆l . A more sophisticated approach [11],
where the problem is mapped onto the worm-like chain model of Kratky and
Porod [12], leads to a slightly diﬀerent expression, A = n−1/2
L k. The two
expressions are equivalent in the limit n
, where they reproduce the
bending energy of the continuous ﬁlament, but they diﬀer for the ﬁnite
number of beads used in the model. The latter leads to faster convergence
in the results as the number of discretization point particles is increased.
We therefore chose to adopt it.

→ ∞

The inextensibility constraint is implemented by introducing equal and
opposite forces along the links between particles. The magnitude of the
forces is computed by imposing a ﬁxed distance ∆l between consecutive
beads at each time step. This is a straightforward matter from the com-
putational point of view, as it involves only the inversion of a tridiagonal
matrix [15].

−

The viscous drag forces acting on the particles of the model ﬁlament
δij(ξkˆtˆt + ξ⊥ ˆnˆn)v, where ˆt and ˆn are respectively
are taken as Fij =
unit vectors parallel and normal to the ﬁlament, ξk, ξ⊥ are the longitudinal
and transverse friction coeﬃcients, and v is the local velocity. This means
that hydrodynamics is approximated as a local eﬀect on the ﬁlament so the
hydrodynamic interaction between diﬀerent points along the curve does not
vary. The global shape of the curve enters only through the anisotropy of
the viscous drag coeﬃcients acting on individual points. The ratio of the two
coeﬃcients depends on the geometric details of the ﬁlament analyzed. For
cilia, ﬂagella, or cytoskeletal ﬁlaments, its value is typically taken between
1.4 and 2 [9]. We chose to adopt an arbitrary 1.5 in most of our simulations,
but we also explored diﬀerent values, including the cases where the two drags

7

are equal or their ratio is lower than one. The time evolution is evaluated in a
molecular dynamics-like fashion, with the only slight subtlety that the Verlet
algorithm has to be modiﬁed to allow for the velocity dependent anisotropic
viscous force [14]. Finally, the active drive at the head is simply implemented
as a constraint on the ﬁrst or ﬁrst two particles. That is, y1 = h0 cos(ωt)
for the oscillating constraint or a periodic torque, Tx = B sin (ωt) realized
as a couple of forces applied to the ﬁrst two beads. Here ω is the driving
frequency.

3 Results for small deviations

3.1 Wave Patterns

Using the ”Sperm Number” Sp deﬁned in section 1, we can characterize the
relative magnitude of the viscous and bending forces. To recapitulate, a low
value of Sp indicates that bending forces dominate, whereas for low values
the dominant forces are viscous. One reason for deﬁning this number comes
from the solution of equation 1 [6] [14]. In fact, Sp can be interpreted as a
rescaled ﬁlament length, where the rescaling factor is a characteristic length

l∗ =
that can be used to non-dimensionalize the equation. Both
for the oscillating constraint and oscillating torque we recover the fact that
the dynamic response, for a ﬁxed driving amplitude, is solely dependent on
Sp.

(cid:17)

In ﬁgure 4 we have plotted the wave patterns for the ﬁlament at diﬀerent
values of Sp. These results were obtained using the oscillating constraint.
That is, the transverse position at the wiggled end is forced to be sinusoidal
in time. The amplitude of the motion is small, the maximum displacement
being 1% of the ﬁlament length. The pictures can be interpreted as “stro-
boscopic snapshots” of the ﬁlament’s motion. For small Sp, bending forces
dominate and the stiﬀ ﬁlament pivots around a ﬁxed point. This motion is
virtually symmetric with respect to time inversions (“reciprocal”). As Sp
increases a (damped) wave travels along the ﬁlament and time reciprocity
is broken. For increasing values of Sp, viscous forces overcome elastic forces
and the characteristic length scale of damping of the traveling wave becomes
smaller. This requires that the spacing between the beads in our discrete
model must also be reduced to give a ﬁxed degree of accuracy. The number
of beads in the model (or equivalently the inverse bead spacing) were thus
increased with increasing Sp to ensure that the results are within a percent
of the true, continuum, values. The oscillating torque gives qualitatively
similar results.

All these results are in agreement with the analytical ﬁndings of Wiggins
and Goldstein [6] in the small amplitude approximation. The agreement is

in time. (c) High Sperm Number (Sp= 22.61). The propagating wave is

also quantitative.

3.2 Swimming

From the simulation we are also able to compute the velocity and eﬃciency
of the movement generated transverse to the wiggling direction (due to the
propulsive force generated by the presence of the active force) as a function
of Sp. We deﬁne swimming of the immersed object as the generation of
motion, through modiﬁcations of shape, in the direction along which no
external force acts. Both the speed and eﬃciency, as Wiggins and Goldstein
predict, display an optimum value at intermediate (but diﬀerent) values of
Sp. Subsequently they reach a plateau as viscous forces begin to dominate
(Sp increases).

plitude oscillation (h0 = 0.01l) of the constraint at the ”head” end of the
ﬁlament. The function goes as the fourth power of Sp for small values of
this number, reaches an optimum, then relaxes to a plateau.

According to the “scallop theorem” of low Reynolds number hydrody-
namics, reciprocal (time reversion invariant) motion generates no swimming
[4]. This is a consequence of the time-reversibility of Stokes ﬂow and sets
an important condition for the ability of microorganisms to swim. In our
case, this implies that we expect no swimming as Sp approaches zero and
the motion approaches reciprocity. This is conﬁrmed by the result in ﬁgure
5. The optimum of the velocity is thus the result of a trade-oﬀ between
non-reciprocity of the motion and damping of the traveling wave.

10

At this point we should also be able to compare our results quantita-
tively with those obtained analytically using the approximation of small
deviations. However, in this respect the theoretical analysis is somewhat
misleading. Computing the time average of the force, as in [5] and [6],
yields the expression

¯F =

h2
0ξ⊥ω
4√2

Y(Sp)

where Y(Sp) is a scaling function that can be computed exactly (ﬁgure 6).
This expression depends only on the transverse friction coeﬃcient and does
not reduce to zero when ξ⊥ = ξk. As such, it is impossible to relate this to
the swimming speed. This follows from the fact that if the condition ξ⊥ = ξk
is satisﬁed there can be no swimming. It is easy to show this must be the
case (basically as a consequence of Newton’s third law). The main reason
is that, if one considers one particle (i.e. a short piece of ﬁlament), the ef-
fective viscous drag that it experiences at any moment in time is decoupled
from the local conﬁguration of the ﬁlament if there is no anisotropy in the
friction coeﬃcients. Averaged over one cycle, this always leads, eﬀectively,
to reciprocal motion. All the forces sum to zero so there can be no dis-
placement. This is shown more formally in the Appendix. Furthermore, our
simulations do indeed yield no average velocity if the two friction coeﬃcients
are equal (we use this to check that there is no “numerical” swimming, due
to the accumulated errors in the simulation). Thus the result given in equa-
tion 3.2, whilst analytically exact, is misleading (probably due to subtleties
in the formalism of the over-damped equation of motion). To correct for
this anomaly we used the theory and computed instead, following the pro-
cedure outlined in [8], the time average of the swimming velocity given the
analytical solution for the shape [5]. This yields (see Appendix)

consistent with both the scallop theorem and Newton’s third Law. It also
predicts a change in the swimming direction if the friction coeﬃcients are
interchanged. Curiously, this reversal of direction has a biological analogue
in the organism Ochromonas which has a ﬂagellum decorated by lateral
projections (mastigonemes) and swims in the same direction as that of the

11

Figure 6: The function Y(Sp) from Wiggins et al..

propagating wave. The body follows the ﬂagellum, instead of preceding it
as in sperm cells ( [1], p.11).

Comparing the modiﬁed analytical expression for the swimming speed
with the simulations, the essential features predicted are obviously present.
Both approach zero as Sp4 for small Sperm numbers, but with increasing
Sperm number display a maximum. In fact, a careful analysis shows that the
agreement, in the small amplitude limit, is exact. The presence of a plateau
at high Sp is hard to interpret, in the sense that it predicts velocities for
even the “inﬁnitely ﬂoppy” ﬁlament, where the wave pattern is completely
damped in an inﬁnitely small region close to the driven extremity. However,
in our simulations we see the velocity dropping only when the size of this
damping region is comparable to the distance between two subsequent dis-
cretization points, so we have to conﬁrm the analytical result and explain
this oddity, as we will see, as a feature of the small deviation approximation.

4 Large Angular Deviations

Our simulation contains the full nonlinear model for the dynamics of the
ﬁlament,
its only limitation being the discretization of space and time.
Therefore, it is interesting to use it to investigate the limitations of the
analytical model when the motion involves shapes that deviate signiﬁcantly
from straight. This is also closer to a real experimental (or biological) sit-
uation. The shapes we found often cannot be described by a function, as

12

the displacement from the horizontal axis is not single-valued. This can be
observed in ﬁgure 7, where we show an example of wave pattern for the
case of oscillating large amplitude constraint. In this case, the maximum
transverse displacement is 60% of the tail length. Looking at this ﬁgure, it
is obvious that the behavior predicted by equation 1 will be substantially
modiﬁed.

Figure 7: Wave patterns for the case of an oscillating constraint with am-
plitude h0 = 0.6 l at Sp = 2.8.

The ﬁrst notable area of disagreement is at high values of the Sperm
number (Sp >> 1) where we no longer ﬁnd a plateau but a slow and steady
drop in both speed and eﬃciency (ﬁgure 8). This eﬀect is clearly a con-
sequence of the non-negligible amplitude of the motion because for smaller
amplitudes a plateau is indeed reached. This is a limitation of the theory,
one respect in which large amplitude motions diﬀer from the small ampli-
tude limit. Further the results for a dimensionless amplitude of 0.25 display
a transient plateau that subsequently decays to zero. This implies that for
any ﬁnite amplitude the dimensionless swimming speed always goes zero for
large enough Sp. The smaller the amplitude the longer the plataeu persists,
but only for negligible amplitude, is it the asymptotic behaviour. It should
be noted that ﬁgures 5 and 8 should be interpreted with care. The swim-
ming velocity is plotted in units of the fraction of the length per cylce. To
obtain absolute swimming speeds, for a tail of given length and stiﬀness, we
would need to multiply this dimensioless swimming speed by the frequency.
The frequency itself is proportional to Sp4 so a plateau in these plots still
implies a swimming speed increasing proportionally with ω. The drop from
the plateau means that the actual swimming speed will increase with fre-
quency, but a a slower rate. Thus, in practice the one armed swimmer can
go as fast as he or she likes by wiggling fast enough.

Secondly, we ﬁnd that the dependence of the optimum swimming speed,

equation 8 predicts as the square of the amplitude of the oscillating con-
straint, becomes linear for higher amplitude oscillations (ﬁgure 9). Thus
far, we have not been able to show why this is the case, but we believe it
is related to the following. For small amplitude motion the elastic wave
simply propagates along an essentially straight ﬁlament. As the amplitude
increases, this is no longer true because the ﬁlament itself is signiﬁcantly
bent and, so far as the damping is concerned, it is the distance along the
ﬁlament that is relevant. This is no longer the same quantity as the abso-
lute distance. This seems to lead to an increase in the eﬀective length of the
ﬁlament.

From these results it is clear that the amplitude of the drive for which the
small deviation approximation breaks down depends on the value of Sp, be-
ing greater for smaller Sperm Numbers. At the optimal value for the speed,
Sp= 4, the approximation holds for maximum transverse displacements of
up to 20% of the tail length, which is well beyond the point one would expect
the assumptions to be valid. However, for a realistic experiment with actin
or a microtubule, the values of Sp are much higher than 4, and the value
for the theshold is much lower. For example, for an actin ﬁlament of 50µm,
driven at 1 cycle/second at an amplitude of 25% of its length, we estimated

a speed of about 1, 7µm/sec with the small deviation model, whereas our
simulation predicts a reduction of this value by a factor 1/4.

For external driving in the form of a torque applied at one end, we have
only considered large amplitude motion. Speciﬁcally, the pre-factor B was
adjusted to produce a maximum angle at the driven end of 60o. This clearly
violates the small angle approximation of Wiggins and Goldstein [6] but is
more consistent with the head deﬂections found in practice for swimming
organisms.
In ﬁgure 10 we plot the eﬃciency and the mean velocity as
functions of Sp. Once again, the two curves agree qualitatively with those
found analytically by Wiggins and Goldstein in that there is a peak speed
and eﬃciency. The values are at slightly diﬀerent values of Sp and, because
the small angle approximation is violated, not quantitatively predicted by
equation 8.

We should add here a few comments. Notably, the peak eﬃciency of less
than 1% seems very low. However, this depends strongly on the amplitude

the torque, or to driving amplitudes of greater than half the length of the
ﬁlament, it is possible to reach values of 2% before the motion becomes
unstable. This is similar to the eﬃciency typical for both the helical screw
mechanism used by bacteria and the sperm motion [14]. Thus, the one-

armed swimmer operating at peak eﬃciency is a plausible and not especially
ineﬃcient entity. Note also that the eﬃciency (which is dimensionless), as
well as the swimming speed, decays to zero rather than reaching a plateau
value. This means that in absolute terms the one-armed swimmer can carry
on with increasing speed by increasing its wiggling frequency but only at
the price of decreasing eﬃciency.

5 Conclusions

We have described a simulation method that can be used to study the mo-
tion of driven elastic ﬁlaments in a low Reynolds number ﬂow. Here, the
hydrodynamic friction is treated quite simply, consistent with comparing
with analytically tractable theories. A more complete calculation of the hy-
drodynamic eﬀects would no doubt be instructive. In particular, the friction
coeﬃcients are not, as we assume here, independent of distance along the
ﬁlament. At the expense of a little more computational complexity, such
eﬀects could be incorporated into our model in a straightforward manner.
We showed that, within this approximation, the picture suggested by Wig-
gins and Goldstein for the linear regime of small angular deviations from
the straight position is essentially correct. Our results for the motion of the

16

ﬁlament, show good agreement with their analytical calculations. There is
an optimal balance between bending forces and viscous forces that leads to
a maximum propulsive speed and eﬃciency. However, in one quantitative
respect our results suggest that their analysis is limited. We could not relate
their expression for the average force exerted by the ﬁlament to the swim-
ming speed. Instead, we used their model to compute an expression for the
average swimming velocity that is physically more plausible and agrees with
the simulation results.

For large amplitude motion, we found that the dependence of the swim-
ming speed on both sperm number and amplitude was signiﬁcantly modiﬁed
relative to the small amplitude case. Further, we postulate that this is due
to the fact that in a highly distorted ﬁlament the wave travels along a
notably diﬀerent path than is the case for small amplitude motion. A quan-
titative understanding of this eﬀect is still, however, lacking. Nonetheless,
the general picture derived from the linear theory, of an optimal compro-
mise between the bending required to break time reversibility and excessive
damping suppressing motion along the ﬁlament, remains valid. The most
signiﬁcant diﬀerence we found was that there will come a point beyond which
increasing the wiggling frequency leads to a drop in eﬃciency. The theory,
on the other hand, predicts that the eﬃciency remains constant.

For realistic amplitudes of oscillation, we found that one-armed swim-
ming is, speed and eﬃciency-wise, a plausible strategy a microorganism
might use to get around. It is also a sight simpler than the helical screw
mechanism used by most bacteria. This requires a rotary joint [1]. Nonethe-
less, while we stand open to correction, we have not been able to identify a
single organism that actually adopts this strategy. Perhaps the most inter-
esting question surrounding the one armed swimmer is thus: why doesn’t
it exist? Based on our results, we suggest two hypotheses. First, localized
bending of the tail requires implausibly high energy densities. Second, the
existence of an evolutionary barrier. It is useless trying to swim with a short
or slow moving tail. Note that at small Sp (that is, low frequency and or
a short appendage) there is nothing to be gained in terms of motility. This
is not the case for either the helical screw mechanism, commonly used by
bacteria, or the traveling wave, used by spermatozoa. Both of these give a
maximum swimming speed and eﬃciency at low sperm numbers.

Regarding experimental studies of in vitro motility, one main problem
so far is that the force involved has been too small to be detectable with
an optical trapping experiment. This limitation could be resolved simply
by time, as it is reasonable to expect that the resolution of experiments will
improve. On the other hand, by means of the model one could try to ﬁnd
the region of the parameter space where this force is expected to be highest,
and try to design an “optimal experiment” where the motility could actually
be quantiﬁed.

5.1 Unequal friction coeﬃcients as a condition for motility

It is possible to show that there can be no movement if the viscous drag
coeﬃcients are equal. Most conveniently, we work with the the discrete
model. Since the discrete model produces the continuum result in the limit
that the number of beads N goes to inﬁnity, there is no loss of generality
(so long as the answer does not depend on N ). The equation of motion for
the center of mass is

where ¯v = 1
N
i=1 vi is the center of mass velocity, m is the total mass. The

total force fi on each bead consists of a bending force fiB a tension force fiT
an hydrodynamic force fiH and an “external” force fiX which accounts for
the external drive. We know that by deﬁnition

Now, the external periodic force is applied only at one extremity, so that

The hydrodynamic force on bead i is written in the form fiH =

ξi⊥ ¯vi⊥ (with ξi× = ξ×/N ). Thus, the eﬀective drag on one particle depends
on the local conﬁguration of the ﬁlament shape.

If the two friction coeﬃcients are the same ξik = ξi⊥ = ξi then

which necessarily leads to zero (or decaying to zero) global velocity. On
the other hand, if the two drags are diﬀerent, the right hand side integral in
equation 10 can be written as

dt ξ∗(t)¯v(t)

Zcycle

18

where ξ∗ is an eﬀective drag which depends on time through the conﬁgura-
tion of the ﬁlament. This integral in general gives a number once, in the
spirit of resistive force theory, the conﬁguration is plugged in, and swimming
is not, therefore, precluded.

5.2 Analytical computation of the mean swimming velocity
in the the small angular deviation approximation

Her we outline the procedure adopted to calculate analytically the aver-
age of the swimming speed using the small deviation approximation. This
calculation largely follows the methodology used in [8] on a diﬀerent model.
We can deﬁne the time average of the swimming speed (projected along

its only nonzero component along the ˆx direction) as

Fixing a reference frame one can consider the “comoving” frame with
respect to the ﬁlament, and expand ψ and τ , together with the absolute dis-
placements h and u, and the swimming speed
as in formula 7. Following
this reasoning we can rewrite in vector notation the formula above for s = 0

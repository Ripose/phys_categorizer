Although models of branching in arterial and bronchial trees often predict a dependence of bifur-
cation parameters on the scale of the bifurcating vessels, direct veriﬁcations of this dependence with
data are uncommon. We compare measurements of bifurcation parameters in airways and arterial
trees of diﬀerent mammals as a function of scale to general features predicted by theoretical models.
We ﬁnd that the size dependence is more complex than existing theories based solely on energy
minimization explain, and suggest additional factors that may govern the branching at diﬀerent
scales.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The factors that might determine the parameters at
bifurcations have recently received attention, and local
bifurcation characteristics have been proposed to deter-
mine scaling laws for biologically important variables
[1]. Theoretical models of branching in the arterial and
bronchial trees usually predict some dependence of the
bifurcation parameters on the scale of the bifurcating ves-
sels [1]-[4]. Many studies of the bifurcation parameters
rely on ordering schemes [5] which, although useful for
certain purposes, do not directly consider the dependence
of the bifurcation parameters on the scale. We explicitly
study the dependence of the bifurcation parameters on
the radius of the parent vessel, thus allowing a more di-
rect comparison with the theoretical models. We show
that important aspects of previous observations [6] for
the human bronchial tree, not predicted by the theoret-
ical models, are more general than what was previously
noticed, as qualitatively similar behavior is observed also
in dog arterial and bronchial trees, and lamb fetal and
neonatal arterial trees.

II. BACKGROUND

Biological airways and arterial trees are principally bi-
furcating trees. That is, starting with the tree root, a
(parent) vessel with radius r0 divides into two (daugh-
ter) vessels with radii r1, r2, and these in turn subdivide
in a similar fashion, continuing until a certain approxi-
mate value of the radius is attained (in the case of arterial
trees, the capillary radius). Variables often used to char-
acterize the bifurcations are the area ratio and the sym-
metry index, deﬁned respectively by a = (r2
0 and

1 +r2

2)/r2

1 + rx

0 = rx

α = r2/r1, where r2 ≤ r1 [7]. These two variables com-
pletely determine r1 and r2 in terms of r0. The branching
exponent x deﬁned for r0 ≥ r1 ≥ r2 by rx
2 is
also often used in modeling and theoretical discussions
[8]-[14]. Most of the predictions of the theoretical mod-
els are stated in terms of this exponent. However, we
ﬁnd this exponent inconvenient for our purposes since
it diverges as r1 or r2 approach r0, as occurs frequently
with experimental data. We will therefore use the area
ratio in our analysis. The value of the exponent x can be
linked to the change of certain quantities at bifurcations.
An exponent x = 2 indicates conservation of total cross
sectional area (a = 1) and a value x = 3 corresponds to
conservation of laminar shear stress at a bifurcation. The
area ratio a is related to x and the symmetry index α by
a = (1 + α2)(1 + αx)− 2
x . This is a monotonic function of
x which does not change much as the value of α is varied
between 0.5 and 1. We will therefore regard the general
features of the area ratio as a counterpart of a similar
qualitative behavior of the exponent x.

Murray [2] proposed that the arterial tree is con-
structed in such a way as to minimize a combination
of the pumping power and the volume of the network.
This leads, if laminar ﬂow is assumed, to Murray’s Law,
which states that x = 3. Murray’s Law has been use-
ful as a reference point regarding the small blood ves-
sels and is sometimes mentioned in discussions regarding
the bronchial tree as well [15]. However, deviations have
been apparent for some time (see [11]-[18] and references
therein). The exponent x has been observed to be gen-
erally smaller than the proposed value of 3.

Recently, West et al.

[1] included the eﬀect of the
blood ﬂow being pulsatile, and found that the minimiza-
tion scheme carried on by Murray leads in this case to a
transition scenario, with x close to 2 for the larger vessels
and to 3 for the smaller vessels. This modiﬁcation pre-
dicts a smooth transition from the larger to the smaller
vessels, as suggested also by Uylings [3] on other grounds.
Other modiﬁcations have been proposed predicting an
exponent between 2 and 3 for the smaller vessels [4, 19].

In order to test these theories we study the bifurcation
parameter a as a function of the parent vessel radius. Za-
mir [7] presented the values of the branching parameters
as a function of the radius for the right coronary artery
of a human heart. The large scatter in the data, how-
ever, makes it diﬃcult to observe the dependence of the
mean values on the scale. Phillips and Kaye [6] studied
the dependence of averaged branching parameters on the
radius of the vessels in the bronchial tree of four mam-
malian species. We show that some important aspects
of their observations for the human bronchial tree (to
be discussed) are more general than what was previously
noticed.

III. ANALYSIS OF THE DATA

We study morphological data from the bronchial tree
of a human, 2 dogs, 2 rats and a hamster obtained by
Raabe et al. [20], a human bronchial tree from Horsﬁeld
et al.
[21], dog lung arterial trees from Dawson et al.
[14], neonatal and fetal lamb lung arterial trees from Ben-
[13], and pig left anterior descending (LAD)
nett et al.
[22] (see Ta-
artery trees obtained from Kassab et al.
ble 1). For each data set, we compute the average value
for the area ratio hai as a function of the parent vessel
radius r as follows. For a given parent vessel radius r we
construct a sample of all bifurcations (r0, r1, r2) which
satisfy r10−ǫ < r0 < r10ǫ, thus making uniform intervals
in log r, and take hai evaluated at r to be the average
of a over this ﬁnite sample. We choose the logarithmic
interval width 2ǫ to be 0.05. For the largest vessels and
sometimes for the very small vessels, the number of bi-
furcations measured is sparse, especially when only one
lung was measured. We reject the values obtained when
the sample for a given range of radii contains less than 4
members.

The results of this procedure are shown in Figure 1.
In order to allow comparisons with the values of the ex-
ponent x predicted by theoretical models, we display the
values of a corresponding to x = 3 as a thick line on
the right axis. The corresponding value of the area ra-
tio a for x = 3 depends on the symmetry index α, and
thus we marked the range of values of a corresponding
to x = 3 for values of α ranging from 0.5 to 1. A value
x = 2 corresponds to a = 1. The error bars correspond to
one standard deviation as computed from the propagated
measurement error taken from the precision to which the
data were reported, and the statistical uncertainty due
to a ﬁnite, noisy sample.

In Fig. 1(a) we show hai as a function of the parent
radius r for the dog and human bronchial trees, obtained
as described above from the Raabe et al. and Horsﬁeld
et al. data sets. In Fig. 1(b) we show the same variables
for the rat and hamster pulmonary arterial trees from the
data by Raabe et al. Similarly, in Fig. 1(c) we display
the area ratio from the dog pulmonary arterial tree, fetal
and neonatal lamb arterial trees, and pig LAD arterial

tree obatined from the data of Dawson et al., Bennett et
al., and Kassab et al., respectively. The behavior for the
largest vessels is not shown in the plots because of lack
of good statistics. It has been shown elsewhere [23] that
the bifurcations of the largest vessels in the arterial tree
generally have an area ratio close to 1.

We ﬁrst discuss the results for the dog and human

bronchial trees [Fig. 1(a)]. The behavior of hai as a func-
tion of r is not a simple one:
it is not constant, as it
would be if the branching were self-similar, nor does it
have a smooth transition from a lower value to a higher
value as r decreases. Remarkably, the same qualitative
behavior is observed in all the plots. This behavior con-
sists of the following pattern: for the very small and close
to terminal vessels, the area ratio is high. As r increases,
hai decreases, reaching a local minimum at r ∼ 1−2 mm.
Then the area ratio grows, and, for Human 1 (boxes) and
the dogs (triangles and stars), one can observe it ﬁnally
decreasing again. In quantitative terms, we remark the
following facts. For the humans (boxes and diamonds),
amongst the largest vessels, the value of the area ratio
hai peaks higher than that corresponding to a value of
x = 3 even when the error bars are taken into account.
For smaller vessels, hai decreases as mentioned before,
attaining values below those equivalent to x = 3. For the
smallest vessels, the area ratio takes values substantially
above those corresponding to x = 3.

A qualitatively similar situation is observed for the ar-
teries [Fig. 1(c)]. For each data set, there is a value of
the radius such that, as the radius becomes less than this
value, the average area ratio decreases, only to increase
again close to the terminal vessels. The fetal and neona-
tal lamb arterial trees (diamonds and stars, respectively)
have smaller overall values of the area ratio, as noted be-
fore [13], but they nevertheless agree with the common
picture. In the dog arterial tree (triangles) the diﬀerent
regimes are particularly marked: area ratio close to 1
for the largest vessels, a bump for the moderately large
vessels, a smaller value of the area ratio as the radius
decreases further, and larger values of the area ratio near
the terminal vessels.

The presence of this characteristic bump was noted by
Phillips et al. [6] for the bronchial tree of the human in
Raabe et al. data set. We see that this behavior is more
general as it is present qualitatively both in arterial and
bronchial trees of diﬀerent species.

The results for the airways of small rodents [Fig. 1(b)]
are not conclusive because of the uncertainty in the data
and the limited range for the radius. The error bars are
consistent both with our previous observations (i.e., a
local minimum for the average area ratio hai at about
r ∼ 1 mm and hai growing close to the terminal vessels),
and with the hypothesis of a constant area ratio.

IV. DISCUSSION

A simple transition of the area ratio from values close
to 1 for the large vessels to higher values for the smaller
vessels, as predicted by some optimization models, is not
supported by the data we studied. The assumption that
an optimization principle is involved in the design of the
arterial and bronchial trees is natural, as evolution would
tend to eliminate designs that are not adapted to meet
the demands of the organisms. We believe, however, that

3

these demands are not restricted to energy eﬃciency (as
assumed in most theories) and that diﬀerent factors com-
pete, resulting in the complex behavior of the area ratio.
As has been remarked recently [24], a bronchial tree de-
signed solely with the purpose of minimizing pumping
power and network volume could be dangerously sensitive
to deviations from the optimal bifurcation values. Higher
area ratios were discussed as a safety margin against the
eﬀect of these variations. Other factors possibly con-
tributing to make the area ratio smaller for the largest
vessels have been already pointed out: impedance match-
ing and minimization of the resistance for pulsatile ﬂow
[1]. A higher value of the area ratio as the radius de-
creases could indicate a tendency to relieve the high pres-
sure and shear stress present in the large vessels. The
large value of the area ratio near the terminal vessels
could allow the ﬂuid to be slowed down as it reaches the
capillaries or alveoli (e.g., to allow fuller transfer of the
transported nutrient to the body). On the other hand,
minimizing the volume or the average circulation time
favors a smaller area ratio on all scales. This discussion
is summarized in Fig. 2. We emphasize that these are
only possible factors, and that this list is not meant to
be exhaustive.

FIG. 2: Schematic representation of possible factors aﬀecting
the area ratio on diﬀerent scales. The factors above the thick
horizontal line could favor higher area ratios, and those be-
low the horizontal line favor a lower area ratio (our vertical
order is otherwise arbitrary). A compromise between these
competing factors could produce transitions as seen in Fig. 1.

In conclusion, we have presented evidence of a con-
sistent and so far unexplained behavior in diverse arte-
rial and bronchial trees. To explain these observations it
might be necessary to couple existing optimality princi-
ples to other requirements. The precise formulation and
understanding of such constraints is a nontrivial and im-
portant problem. The consequences for allometric scaling
are also important, as the branching pattern of the ar-
terial tree has been argued [1] to be determinant of the
scaling of many variables. We believe it will be fruitful
to carry on a similar analysis on other data.

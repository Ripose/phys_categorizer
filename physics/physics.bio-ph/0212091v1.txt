Abstract

It is shown that metric representation of DNA sequences is one-to-one. By

using the metric representation method, suppression of nucleotide strings in

the DNA sequences is determined. For a DNA sequence, an optimal string

length to display genomic signature in chaos game representation is obtained

by eliminating eﬀects of the ﬁnite sequence. The optimal string length is fur-

ther shown as a self-similarity limit in computing information dimension. By

using the method, self-similarity limits of bacteria complete genomic signa-

tures are further determined.

I. INTRODUCTION

Along with an increasing amount of DNA sequences extracted from experiments, it is im-

portant to develop methods for extracting meaningful information from the one-dimensional

symbolic sequences composed of the four letters ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘G’ and ‘T’ (or ‘U’). To detect

similarity in DNA sequences, scatter plots [1] are introduced to make classiﬁcation of cy-

tochromes and illustrate a dendrogram. From a comparison of a pair of duplicated genes

by a distance matrix, evolutionary relationship of three primary kingdoms of life is inferred

[2]. Due to investigating relative abundances of short oligonucleotides in subsequences,

genomic signature phenomenon and derivation of partial-ordering relationships among bac-

terial genomes are proposed [3]. The genomic signature describes that the diﬀerence of

1

dinucleotide relative abundance values within a single genome is larger than that between

distinct genomes. Chaos game representation (CGR) [4], which generates a two-dimensional

square from a one-dimensional sequence, provides a technique to visualize the composition

of DNA sequences. By composing the CGR and short-sequence representation methods, the

evolution of species-type speciﬁcity in mitochondral genomes is analyzed [5]. In terms of the

CGR method, it is shown that the main characteristics of the whole genome can be exhib-

ited by its subsequences [6]. The genomic signature is extended to describe characteristics

of CGR images. By making a Euclidean metric between two CGR images, classiﬁcation of

species in three primary kingdoms is discussed.

Recently, metric representation (MR) [7], which is borrowed from the symbolic dynamics,

makes an ordering of subsequences in a plane. The MR method is an extension of CGR.

Suppression of certain nucleotide strings in the DNA sequences leads to a self-similarity

of pattern seen in the MR of DNA sequences. In this paper, ﬁrst, we show that the MR

is one-to-one. Due to the MR method, we determine suppression of nucleotide strings in

DNA sequences. Then, eliminating eﬀects of ﬁnite sequences on suppression of nucleotide

strings, we give an optimal string length to display genomic signature. Moreover, we plot

information function versus string lengths to determine self-similarity limits in MR images.

Using the method, we present self-similarity limits of bacteria complete genomic signatures.

II. SUPPRESSION OF NUCLEOTIDE STRINGS

For a given DNA sequence, we have a one-dimensional symbolic sequence s1s2 · · · si · · · sN

(si ∈ {A, C, G, T }). In a two-dimensional MR, we take the correspondence of symbol si to

number µi or νi ∈ {0, 1} and calculate the values (α, β) of all subsequences Σm = s1s2 · · · sm

(1 ≤ m ≤ N). The number α represented in base 3, between 0 and 1, is deﬁned as

α = 2

µm−j+13−j + 3−m = 2

µi3−(m−i+1) + 3−m,

(1)

m

X
j=1

where µi is 0 if si ∈ {A, C} or 1 if si ∈ {G, T }. Similarly, the number β is deﬁned as

m

X
i=1

β = 2

νm−j+13−j + 3−m = 2

νi3−(m−i+1) + 3−m,

(2)

m

X
j=1

m

X
i=1

where νi is 0 if si ∈ {A, T } or 1 if si ∈ {C, G}. According to (1) and (2), the one-

dimensional symbolic sequence s1s2 · · · sN is partitioned into 4 kinds of subsequences, which

correspond to points in 4 fundamental zones A, C, G and T of Fig. 1. Under left or right shift

operators, each zone can be further shrunk to less zones with a factor of 1/32. For an inﬁnite

sequence, this procedure can be deﬁned as a fractal [8], which has a self-similarity. The

subsequences with the same ending k-nucleotide string are labeled by Σ(k). All subsequences

Σ(k) correspond to points in the zone encoded by the k-nucleotide string.

Lemma 1 (α, β){S(Σm)} = 2(µm+1, νm+1)/3 + (α, β){Σm}/3. S is a left shift operator.

PROOF: Note that for the left shift operator, S(Σm) = Σmsm+1. From the deﬁnition (1)

and (2), we can immediately obtain the result.

Lemma 2 (α, β){Σm} = (α, β){G∞Σm}.
PROOF: When m = 1, Σ1 = s1 and G∞Σ1 = S(G∞). By the Lemma 1, we can ob-
tain (α, β){G∞Σ1} = 2(µ1, ν1)/3 + (α, β){G∞}/3 = 2(µ1, ν1)/3 + (1, 1)/3 = (α, β){Σ1}.
Suppose when m = i, we have (α, β){Σi} = (α, β){G∞Σi}. For m = i + 1, we have
Σi+1 = Σisi+1 = S(Σi) and G∞Σi+1 = S(G∞Σi). By the Lemma 1, we obtain (α, β){Σi+1} =
2(µm+1, νm+1)/3 + (α, β){Σi}/3 and (α, β){G∞Σi+1} = 2(µm+1, νm+1)/3 + (α, β){G∞Σi}/3.
So, using the supposition (α, β){Σi} = (α, β){G∞Σi}, we can lead to (α, β){Σi+1} =
(α, β){G∞Σi+1}.

By the Lemma 2, each ﬁnite subsequence Σm has a correspondent inﬁnite sequence

G∞Σm. Here, we deﬁne a set of the inﬁnite sequences as Σ.

Theorem 1 (α, β) : Σ → Λ is one-to-one. Λ is a set of points in the (α, β) plane.

This means that given Σ1, Σ2 ∈ Σ, if Σ1 6= Σ2, then (α, β){Σ1} 6= (α, β){Σ2}. We

give a proof by contradiction. Suppose (α, β){Σ1} = (α, β){Σ2} and is marked as P in

the the (α, β) plan. For the zone including the point P , we encode it as two subsequences

Σ1

1 and Σ2

1 with the same mononucleotide. Then, enlarge the zone by a area factor of 32,

we can obtain two encoding subsequences Σ1

2 and Σ2

2 with the same dinucleotide. Each

3

enlarging process provides a right shift to two subsequences. At the same time, the point P

is only included in one of four enlarged zones. So, two shifting subsequences are the same.

Following the enlarging process in an inﬁnite step, we can obtain Σ1 = Σ2, contradicting our

original assumption. This contraction is due to the fact that we have assumed (α, β){Σ1} =

(α, β){Σ2}; thus, Σ1 6= Σ2, then (α, β){Σ1} 6= (α, β){Σ2}.

For the DNA sequence, some zones in CGR are replenished by points, so that a pattern

appears. In CGR, there exists an correspondence of more subsequences with diﬀerent ending

k-nucleotide strings to the same points in bounds of zones. For examples, subsequences G∞A

in the zone A, T ∞C in the zone C, A∞G in the zone G and C ∞T in the zone T have the same

points in CGR (1/2,1/2). Under left shift operators, the corresponding relation between

points and subsequences can preserve in zones with small enough lengths. For example,

subsequences G∞AC in the zone AC, T ∞C 2 in the zone C 2, A∞GC in the zone GC and

C ∞T C in the zone T C have the same points in CGR (1/4,3/4). In MR of DNA sequences,

each zone in CGR is shrunk and clearly divided by four bands. There exists a one-to-one

correspondence between zones and ending k−nucleotide strings of subsequences. Frequency

of points in the zone can be determined by using MR method as follows. In order to compute

frequencies in zones encoded by k-nucleotide strings, we need to determine partition lines

of MR in Fig. 1. For mononucleotides, there exist 2 × 2 zones in the MR. We have n1(= 3)

partition lines b1

0 = 0, b1

1 = 1/2 and b1

2 = 1 along the α axis. For denucleotides, there exist

4 × 4 zones in the MR. We have n2(= 5) partition lines b2

0 = b1

0 = 0, b2

1 = b1

i

0 = 1 along the α axis. In general, for k − 1-

(i = 0, 1, · · · , nk−1 − 1)

along the α axis, we can obtain nk(= 2k +1 = 2nk−1−1) partition lines bk

i (i = 0, 1, · · · , nk −1)

for k-nucleotide strings as follows. For the k-nucleotide strings, there exist 2k × 2k zones in

the MR. The left half (0 ≤ i ≤ nk−1 − 1) of partition lines along the α axis are described as

follows

From (3), the right half (nk−1 ≤ i ≤ nk − 1) of partition lines along the α axis can be

determined immediately

For example, for trinucleotides, 9 partition lines along the α axis are 0, 1

and 1. We can obtain 17 partition lines 0, 1

1 along the α axis for tetranucleotides. Partition lines along the β axis are the same to those

along the α axis. Each zone in the MR can thus be surrounded by the combined partition

lines along the α and β axes.

Using the MR method, we determine suppression of k-nucleotide strings in HUMHBB

(human β-region, chromosome 11) with 73308 bases and YEAST1 (yeast chromosome 1)

with 230209 bases in Table I, respectively. In order to check eﬃciency of the method, we

also determine the number of disappearing strings in all strings for a giving string length

in HUMHBB and YEAST1, respectively. The results are identical with those in Table I,

respectively. So, the MR method is eﬀective to determine suppression of nucleotide strings

in DNA sequences.

In CGR of DNA sequences, self-similarity patterns change more obscurely as lengths

of sequences increase. A grey plot describes frequency values in small zones, which sizes

(2−k × 2−k) can be given by lengths of strings encoding the zones (k). Along with increase of

string lengths, the self-similarity patterns in CGR are more clear. A high and low frequent

zones are redivided to smaller and described by a grey scale. Some empty zones may appear

in the patterns of CGR, i.e., some nucleotide strings are suppressed in the sequences. In

the procedure of decreasing zone sizes, more and more empty zones emerge in the patterns

of CGR. For example, evolution of a self-similarity pattern in CGR of the archaebacteria

Archeoglobus fulqidus is shown in Fig. 1 of Ref. [6].

If DNA sequences are inﬁnite, the

5

compositional structure can be displayed in small enough zones. Empty zones are a part

of the global feature in CGR. But the DNA sequences are ﬁnite. A ﬁnite sequence, even

a random sequence, may also lead to suppression of strings. Along with increase of string

length, more and more strings are suppressed in the ﬁnite sequences.

In Table I, we compare the suppression of nucleotide strings between DNA and random

sequences with the same length. Suppression of nucleotide strings for HUMHBB starts at

k=5. For a random sequence with the same length, which is given by using a random num-

ber generator [9], suppression of nucleotide strings is delayed to start at k=7. The number

of suppressed nucleotide strings for the random number is 5.67% of that for HUMHBB.

The ﬁnite sequence of HUMHBB eﬀects on the suppression of 7-nucleotide strings. Along

with increase of k, numbers of suppressed nucleotide strings for the random number more

increase and approach those for HUMHBB. At k =10, the number of suppressed nucleotide

strings for the random number is 99.3% of that for HUMHBB. In this case, suppression of

nucleotide strings in HUMHBB is mainly caused by the ﬁnite length of sequence. Moreover,

suppression of nucleotide strings for YEAST1 starts at k=7. For a random sequence with

the same length, which is given by using a random number generator [9], suppression of

nucleotide strings is delayed to start at k=8. The number of suppressed nucleotide strings

for the random number is 22.7% of that for YEAST1. The ﬁnite sequence of YEAST1 eﬀects

on the suppression of 8-nucleotide strings. At k=10, the number of suppressed nucleotide

strings for the random number is 97.5% of that for YEAST1. Due to the comparison of

suppression of nucleotide strings, we can thus obtain that HUMHBB and YEAST1 have

shorter suppressed nucleotide strings than random sequences with the same lengths, respec-

tively. Along with increase of string lengths, the ﬁnite sequences take stronger eﬀects on

suppression of nucleotide strings.

In order to display genomic signature, we must eliminate eﬀects of ﬁnite sequences on

suppression of nucleotide strings. For a DNA sequence, we take the longest string length

before suppression of nucleotide strings in a random sequence with the same lengths as an

optimal option of string lengths. According to the deﬁnition, string lengths 6 and 7 can be

6

chosen as optimal options for genomic signatures of HUMHBB and YEAST1, respectively.

III. LIMITS OF SELF-SIMILARITY SCALES

Suppression of certain nucleotide strings in the DNA sequences leads to a fractal pattern

seen in the MR of DNA sequences. To quantify the fractal feature in the MR of DNA

sequences, we introduce information dimension. For a given length k of nucleotide strings,

we have M(= N − k + 1) subsequences Σi(i = k, k + 1, · · · , N), which end with M k-

nucleotide strings. The subsequences are corresponding to M points in a MR. In the MR,

the length of a zone and the total number of zones are ǫ = 3−k and Z = 4k, respectively.

The numbers of points falling in the i-th zone and of non-empty zones are labeled by mi(ǫ)

and Z(ǫ), respectively. Dividing the number mi(ǫ) by the total point number M yields a

probability pi(ǫ) for the i-th zone. Information function and dimension for the points in MR

are respectively deﬁned [10] as

and

I(ǫ) = −

pilogpi,

Z(ǫ)

X
i=1

D1 = lim
ǫ→0

I(ǫ)
log(1/ǫ)

.

(5)

(6)

The information function I(ǫ) during a range of log(1/ǫ) has a scaling region. The scaling

region reﬂects the self-similarity of pattern in the MR. The information dimension D1 can

be found from the slope in scaling region I(ǫ) versus log(1/ǫ). When the length ǫ of a zone

in MR increases from 3−k to 2−k, MR of DNA sequences changes to CGR. Information

dimension in CGR can thus be determined as (log23)D1. We compute information function

I(ǫ) with diﬀerent sizes ǫ for HUMHBB and draw in Fig. 2. A linear part of the curve

I(ǫ) versus log(1/ǫ) emerges between log(1/ǫ) = log3 = 1.10 and log(1/ǫ) = 6log3=6.59. A

ﬁtting line is also draw in Fig. 2. The point for log(1/ǫ) = 7log3=7.69 is started leaving

from the line. Along with the decrease of log(1/ǫ), farther and farther the points leave

7

from the line. Since points in the zones correspond to k-nucleotide strings, we can obtain

that the self-similarity of pattern in the MR preserves approximately from mononucleotides

to 6-nucleotide strings, as well as the suppression of many nucleotide strings emerges at

7-nucleotide strings. Using the least-squares ﬁt method [9] for the liner part, we determine

its slope, i.e., information dimension D1, to 1.20. It is less than the information dimension

1.26 for random sequence with the same length. Moreover, in Fig. 3, we draw information

function I(ǫ) versus log(1/ǫ) for YEAST1. A linear part of the curve I(ǫ) versus log(1/ǫ)

exists between log(1/ǫ) = log3 = 1.10 and log(1/ǫ) = 7log3=7.69. We can obtain that the

suppression of many nucleotide strings in YEAST1 emerges from 8-nucleotide strings. Using

the least-squares ﬁt method [9] for the liner part, we also plot a ﬁtting line in Fig. 3 and

determine its slope, i.e., information dimension D1, to 1.22. It is less than the information

dimension 1.26 for random sequence with the same length. The limits of self-similarity in

MR of HUMHBB and YEAST1 are equivalent to the optimal string lengths for genomic

signatures, respectively. Thus, for presenting genomic signature, a self-similarity limit as an

optimal string length can be determined in computing information dimension.

Using the MR method, we determine suppression of k-nucleotide strings of bacteria

complete genomes in Table II, where we put suppression of k-nucleotide strings in the order

of decrease. For each of the bacteria complete genomes, a linear part exists in the plot of

information function I(ǫ) versus log(1/ǫ). From the linear parts, we determine self-similarity

limits of genomic signatures in Table II. Keeping in the order, we ﬁnd the suppression of

bacteria complete genomes does not necessarily depend on the lengths of sequences. The

common optimal string length for the bacteria complete genomic signatures can be chosen

as 7.

In summary, we have shown MR of DNA sequences is one-to-one. Due to the MR

method, suppression of nucleotide strings in the DNA sequences is determined. For a DNA

IV. CONCLUSION

8

sequence, an optimal string length to display genomic signature is obtained by eliminating

eﬀects of the ﬁnite sequence. The optimal string length is further shown as a self-similarity

limit in computing information dimension. By using the method, self-similarity limits of

bacteria complete genomic signatures are further determined.

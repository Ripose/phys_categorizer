Abstract

Our sense of smell relies on sensitive, selective atomic-scale processes that are initiated when a

scent molecule meets speciﬁc receptors in the nose. However, the physical mechanisms of detec-

tion are not clear. While odorant shape and size are important, experiment indicates these are

insuﬃcient. One novel proposal suggests inelastic electron tunneling from a donor to an accep-

tor mediated by the odorant actuates a receptor, and provides critical discrimination. We test

the physical viability of this mechanism using a simple but general model. Using values of key

parameters in line with those for other biomolecular systems, we ﬁnd the proposed mechanism

is consistent both with the underlying physics and with observed features of smell, provided the

receptor has certain general properties. This mechanism suggests a distinct paradigm for selective

molecular interactions at receptors (the swipe card model): recognition and actuation involve size

and shape, but also exploit other processes.

Our sense of smell aﬀects our behavior profoundly. Discrimination between small

molecules, often in very low concentrations, allows us to make judgments about our immedi-

ate environment[1] and inﬂuence our perceptions. Even though odorants are key components

of many commercial products[2], the biomolecular processes of olfaction are inadequately un-

derstood: scent design is not straightforward. We know that odor detection involves several

types of receptor for a given odorant, and understand how a receptor signal is ampliﬁed and

processed[3, 4]. However, the initial selective atomic-scale processes as the scent molecule

meets its nasal receptors are not well understood. Odorant shape and size are certainly

important, but experiment shows these are insuﬃcient. Here we assess the novel proposal

that a critical early step involves inelastic electron tunneling mediated by the odorant. We

test the physical viability of this mechanism[5] using electron transfer (ET) theory, with

values of key parameters in line with those for other biomolecular systems. The proposed

mechanism is viable (there are no physics-based objections and is consistent with known

features of olfaction) provided the receptor has certain general properties. This mechanism

has wider importance because it introduces a distinct paradigm for selective actuation of

receptors: whereas lock and key models[6] imply size, shape and non-bonding interactions

(the docking criteria) are all, in our swipe card model recognition and actuation involve

other processes in addition to docking. Thus it encompasses and goes beyond mechanisms

such as proton transfer, discussed by us previously[7].

All current theories agree that selective docking of odorants is important[2]. However,

odorants are small molecules (rarely more than a few tens of atoms[2]), and it is improba-

ble that docking criteria alone oﬀer suﬃcient discrimination. For example, molecules with

almost identical shapes can smell very diﬀerent: replacing carbon with its isosteres Si, Ge

and Sn invariably markedly alter odor character[8]. Something more is needed for olfaction,

leading to early suggestions that odorant vibration frequencies were critical [9, 10], though

without speciﬁc mechanisms. Both infrared and inelastic electron tunneling[11, 12] (IETS)

spectroscopies distinguish very precisely between diﬀerent molecules through vibrational fre-

quencies and intensities, which makes the proposal appealing. The ﬁrst speciﬁc mechanism

(based on IETS) was Turin’s[13] idea that there is odorant mediated inelastic tunneling of

an electron at the receptor: inelastic tunneling between receptor electronic states diﬀering in

energy by ¯hω that occurs only when energy is conserved by emission of an odorant phonon of

the right energy, hence selectivity. Clearly, the vibration must also couple to the electronic

2

transition.

Experiment oﬀers several tests of Turin’s idea. It explains why certain molecules with

very diﬀerent shapes can smell similar (e.g. boranes and thiols), but also why some molecules

of essentially identical shape smell utterly diﬀerent (e.g. 1,1-dimethylcyclohexane and its sila

counterpart) because of frequency or coupling changes. The question of whether humans

can distinguish between a molecule and its deuterated counterpart is still controversial.

There is evidence both for[13, 14] and against[15].

In animals, isotope discrimination is

well-documented[16]. Both left- and right-handed forms of enantiomers should have the

same vibrational spectrum. The odors of some enantiomer pairs are the same (type 1) while

others diﬀer (type 2)[17]. Type 2 can be explained by docking criteria (diﬀerent chiralities ﬁt

diﬀerent receptors), while type 1 is naturally explained by vibrational frequency. However,

docking and frequency together can account for both since chirality will aﬀect the intensity

of response of receptors to the enantiomers (the helices that form the walls of the receptors

are chiral). Quantitative support for the theory comes from the successful correlation of odor

character with tunneling frequency spectrum[18] for a range of odorants. Indeed, vibrational

frequency has been found to correlate better with odor than structure [19]. Thus a molecule’s

vibrational spectrum appears closely linked to its odor. We now test whether the physical

processes underlying Turin’s proposed mechanism for detecting the frequency are credible.

First we focus on the odorant and perform a simple test of whether odor can be related

to vibrational frequency and to coupling to the odorant charges (as required by IETS).

We computed the vibrational spectra of H2S and four boranes (decaborane, m-, o- and p-

carborane). The boranes are structurally similar, but all quite distinct from H2S. However,

H2S and decaborane smell sulfuraceous, while the carboranes smell camphoraceous. Using

Gaussian 03[20] we computed vibrational frequencies and infrared (IR) couplings, deﬁned

2

∂~p/∂Qi
|

with ~p the dipole moment and Qi a displacement along normal mode i. The
as
sulfuraceous smell of H2S is associated with vibrations in the region of 2600 cm−1[21]. In this

|

region decaborane has IR couplings that are one to two orders of magnitude greater than the

carboranes. Assuming that the IR couplings are a good estimate of the electron-oscillator

coupling in an olfactory receptor, this could explain sulfuraceous and less sulfuraceous odors.

Turning to the combined odorant and receptor system, we must determine whether ET

is possible on the relevant time scale, and if so whether the discriminating electron transfer

rate (with excitation of the critical odorant mode) is suﬃciently large relative to rates

3

for non-discriminatory transfer channels (without excitation of the critical mode). This is

necessary because most IETS experiments observe inelastic tunneling with phonon emission

as a weak adjunct to the elastic component, detected only by complex post-processing of a

type unlikely in a nasal environment. Too little is currently known about the atomic and

electronic structure of real odorant receptors for full-scale calculations.

Instead we make

general assumptions about the nature of the receptor, the odorant and their interaction.

These assumptions relate to a series of characteristic times corresponding to the required

physical processes (see Fig. 1).

Turin’s theory requires a source of electrons or holes to allow charge ﬂow to take place.

The precise biological origin is not known, but may well consist of reducing (oxidizing)

species (X) in the cell ﬂuid [2]. These molecules diﬀuse through the aqueous medium and

arrive with an average interval of τX. Using a standard approach for computing reactant

collision rates in solution from the diﬀusion equation and the Stokes-Einstein relation for the

diﬀusion coeﬃcient[22] we get τX = 3η/2nXkBT where η is the viscosity of water (0.891
10−3 kgm−1

×
s−1), nX is the concentration of X, kB is Boltzmann’s constant and T is the

temperature. Note that this result is independent of the nature of X or the receptor. Since

nX will probably lie in the range 1 µM

100 µM, we get a range of values for τX of

→

10 µs

1 ms. The charge now has to cross from the molecule to the receptor molecule, a

→

process that can be described by Marcus theory [23, 24, 25], and characterized by a time

τI. In proteins times range from about 1 ms down to about 1 µs[26]. The injected charge

has to propagate through to the donor (D). The route is not known, but probably involves

hopping transport. Thus the journey time is likely be in the ms to µs range as for charge

injection. The next step is the inelastic tunneling from D to A (the acceptor), and it is this

charge movement that actuates the receptor. Now the charge must reach the mechanism

that releases the G-protein which in turn initiates the signal that is sent to the brain. Again,

we do not know the route taken but is likely to involve charge hopping. So the characteristic

time τR will probably be in the range ms to µs. Thus, overall charge injection and extraction

together are likely to occur on typical biological time scales of µs to ms.

For the mechanism to work there must be essentially no tunneling from D to A in the

absence of the odorant, either because the distance is too great or energy conservation

is problematic. The odorant must make inelastic transmission possible by a mechanism

coupling electron movement from D and A to vibrational excitation in the odorant.

In

4

FIG. 1: The olfactory receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor with seven hydrophobic helices

that span the cell membrane. It responds to the arrival of a recognized odorant by releasing the

α-subunit of a neighboring G-protein, which in turn initiates a large inﬂux of Ca ions into the cell,

a signal that can be communicated to the brain. This ﬁgure represents the model of the receptor we

use to describe its action. The electron (hole) source X is likely to be a reducing (oxidizing) agent

in the cell ﬂuid. It arrives at a site on the outside of the receptor protein where it can exchange

charge after an average interval τX. Once in place, it exchanges a charge with a characteristic time

τI . The charge then travels to the donor D in one transmembrane helix of the protein over an

average time of τL, from where it then hops to the acceptor A (possibly in a diﬀerent helix) with

either an average time τT 0 for non-discriminating (“elastic”) tunneling or an average time τT 1 for

discriminating (“inelastic”) tunneling. Only the inelastic contribution is sensitive to the odorant

(M ) oscillator frequency ω0, and so needs to dominate the elastic contribution (τT 0

τT 1). The

≫

electron then travels from A to trigger the release of the G-protein (G) over a time τR. Note that

the terms elastic and inelastic refer only to energy exchange with the odorant.

IETS there is a strong contribution to this coupling from the Coulomb interaction between

partial charges associated with oscillating atoms and a mobile electron[27, 28]. This same

mechanism allows us to account for observed features of olfaction including the detection of

oscillators buried inside a molecule (e.g. 2,6 di-t-butyl phenol [2]), and is compatible with

5

our swipe card model: the long-ranged interaction can couple the mobile electron to the

oscillator even with a loose ﬁt.

The times characterising elastic (τT 0) and inelastic (τT 1) ET from D to A are central

to the success or failure of Turin’s mechanism. We treat D and A as single molecular or-

bitals with energies εD and εA, coupled to each other by a weak hopping integral t, but

not coupled to other electronic states. Since the hopping between D and A is slow on elec-

tronic time scales, the remaining electronic couplings must be very weak to prevent electron

leakage. However, D and A will be coupled to oscillators in the odorant, receptor protein

and the wider environment. The ET rate from D to A can be computed from standard

theory[23, 24, 25, 29, 30, 31] but with the odorant oscillator treated explicitly. We consider

one odorant oscillator of frequency ωo which couples with strength γD (γA) to D (A) . The

We now estimate values for the parameters (Table I). The interesting range for ¯hωo in

olfaction is about 70 meV to 400 meV[18], so a typical value is 200 meV. To estimate the

We assume the odorant (M) contacts D and A but interacts with them only weakly with

hopping integral v. By considering the resulting admixtures of an M state with energy

εM with those of D and A we obtain an eﬀective hopping integral between D and A (
t = v2/(εM

εA)). If εM corresponds to a LUMO while εD and εA correspond to HOMOs

then the diﬀerence εM

εA can be as large as 10 eV. The hopping integrals can be estimated

−

−

for known molecular structures. Whilst the odorant structure is known, the donor and

acceptor structures interacting with it are unknown, and we have to make an educated

guess. If the bonds between M, and D and A are no stronger than hydrogen bonds, we can

put a rough upper bound on the associated hopping integrals of order 0.1 eV, and hence

obtain t

1 meV. Our ﬁnal conclusions are not sensitive to this value.

∼

Reorganisation energies are typically of order 1 eV, especially in hydrated systems, which

7

would result in the elastic channel being much faster than the inelastic. But much smaller

values have been found, and olfactory receptors are hydrophobic. Experiments on charge

separation in mutant reaction centers of the photosynthetic bacteria Rhodobacter capsulatus

show reorganisation energies at room temperature below 0.03 eV[35]. A generally low value

for odorant receptors would be a result of evolutionary optimization leading to almost no

reorganization during the transition. This requires that D and A are not too close to the

aqueous medium in the cell to prevent signiﬁcant coupling to the polarization of the water;

thus we conjecture that D and A must lie well within the lipid bilayer region (see Fig. 1).

The reorganisation energy can also be reduced if electronic states on D and A are extended

in space[29], so residues with delocalized electrons may be candidates. (For example, the

conserved[36] tryptophan on helix 4 and 3 phenylalanines on helix 3. The surrounding highly

variable residues could modify their redox potentials, producing diﬀerent receptors. ) We

take a value for the reorganisation energy of 0.03 eV for the table of values.

Substituting the values in Table I into Eq. 1 for the case of resonance (εD

εA = ¯hωo)

we get τT 0

87 ns and τT 1

1.3 ns, which satisﬁes the condition τT 1

τT 0, and shows that

∼

∼

the overall time for odor recognition is not limited by the discrimination process. Increasing

−

≪

the reorganization energy to just 50 meV would make τT 1 > τT 0. Thus, provided the

reorganisation energy can be made not much bigger than kBT , we can obtain a large signal

to noise ratio. We note that the theory remains unaltered if a proton tunnel from D to A,

but the parameters t, εD and εA will be modiﬁed.

Our analysis indicates that Turin’s model is physically viable provided the receptor has

certain properties (notably, very low reorganization energy) within ranges known from other

biomolecular systems. Our model shows that the overall charge transfer rate is suﬃcient to

permit detection on the observed timescales, and the inelastic signal can be made suﬃciently

large relative to the elastic signal for there to be an acceptable signal to noise ratio. Lack of

information on local receptor structure limits what can be veriﬁed. Our model illustrates a

more general idea of how molecules can actuate receptors selectively. Lock and key models

rely on docking for discrimination, and mechanical mechanisms for actuation. Selective

docking does have a role in our class of swipe card models, but the crucial discrimination

and non-mechanical actuation processes are diﬀerent.

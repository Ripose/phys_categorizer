Abstract

We consider evolution of initial disturbances in spatially extended systems
with autonomous rhythmic activity, such as the heart. We consider the case
when the activity is stable with respect to very smooth (changing little across
the medium) disturbances and construct lattice models for description of not-
so-smooth disturbances, in particular, topological defects; these models are
modiﬁcations of the diﬀusive XY model. We ﬁnd that when the activity on
each lattice site is very rigid in maintaining its form, the topological defects—
vortices or spirals—nucleate a transition to a disordered, turbulent state.

I. INTRODUCTION

Physical mechanisms underlying many cardiac arrhythmias, in particular the transition
from ventricular tachycardia (VT) to ventricular ﬁbrillation (VF), are not fully understood.
The ventricular tissue is known, both experimentally and theoretically, to support long-
living spiral excitations, and it is thought that a breakup of such a spiral could give rise to
a turbulent, chaotic activity commonly associated with VF. (Spirals are reviewed in books
[1].) A considerable eﬀort is now being directed towards understanding of these defect-
mediated transitions to turbulence within mathematical models of ventricular tissue. The
currently popular approach (reviewed in Ref. [2]) considers a spiral in a patch (or slab) of
ventricular tissue; the patch is taken in isolation from any pacemaking source. One then
follows numerically the time evolution of that initial spiral.

In the real beating heart, however, the ventricles are not isolated from other regions, and
the heart, viewed as a whole, supports a (more or less) periodic autonomous activity—the
heartbeat itself. In this case, any defect should be properly viewed as a disturbance of the
normal heartbeat, rather than a structure in isolated tissue. In this paper we present some
general results on the evolution of initial disturbances in autonomously active media and
discuss their possible applications to cardiac arrhythmias. In particular, we identify a simple
mechanism of defect-induced transition to turbulence in discrete (lattice) systems. We also
ﬁnd that the more rigid is the system in maintaining locally the undisturbed form of activity,
the more easily the transition to turbulence occurs. This observation can potentially identify
a useful therapeutic target.

The assumed lattice structure need not (though it may) be related to the mechanical
structure of the medium. The size of the lattice spacing in our models simply represents
the smallest spatial scale on which the rhythmic activity can be desynchronized: a region
smaller than that scale will necessarily ﬁre as one. Discrete models of ﬁbrillation have a
long history, cf. the 1964 model of Moe et al. [3]. (Unlike these authors, though, we do
not introduce any frozen inhomogeneity in the parameters of the medium, apart from the
lattice structure itself.) In addition, the importance of a discrete (granular) structure of the
medium has been emphasized in theoretical studies of deﬁbrillation [4].

We introduce an interaction of an excitable region (like the ventricles) with a pace-
making region using the following simpliﬁed (not anatomical) model. We consider a three-
dimensional (3d) slab of simulated medium whose extent in the z direction is limited by the
planes z = 0 and z = Lz. The properties of the medium change in the z direction: the region
near z = 0 is spontaneously oscillatory and represents the pacemaking region; the region
at larger z is merely excitable and represents the ventricular tissue. The z direction will
be also called longitudinal, and the other two directions, x and y, will be called transverse.
The medium supports a spontaneous rhythmic activity, in which an inﬁnite train of pulses
propagates from small to large z. This steady activity is independent of x and y and is
supposed to model the heart’s normal rhythm, in which pulses propagate from the inner
surface of the ventricles out.

The goal of our study was to see what happens if at some instant the spontaneous
rhythmic activity is disturbed in a spatially nonuniform fashion, and then the system is left
to itself. We approach this question in two steps. First, we consider the case when the initial
disturbance is very smooth, i.e. almost uniform across the medium; in particular, it captures

2

no topological defects. In this case, we expect that locally the activity rapidly relaxes close
to its undisturbed form. The state can then be described using a single ﬁeld τ (x, y, z; t),
which measures the space- and time-dependent delay (or advance) in activity among the
local regions. This ﬁeld is a phase variable: it is deﬁned modulo the period T of the steady
rhythm. For these smooth perturbations, we expect that the dynamics of τ at large times
will be universal: it will be described by an equation whose form (although not the precise
values of the coeﬃcients) does not depend on the details of electrophysiology or on the
microstructure of the medium. In particular, this large-time dynamics does not “see” the
granular structure of the medium. The form of the equation depends on the symmetries of
the medium at large scales and can be obtained by keeping terms of the lowest order in space
and time derivatives consistent with the symmetries. For simplicity, we will assume that
at large scales the properties of the medium are invariant under translations and rotations
in the x–y plane and that τ does not depend on z, i.e. the disturbance is eﬀectively two-
dimensional (2d). (Recall that z is the direction of propagation of the normal rhythm.) In
this case, the equation describing the large-time dynamics has the form

where the phase θ(x, y; t) is related to τ via

∂tθ = a

2θ + c(

∇2θ)2 ,

θ(x, y; t) = 2πτ (x, y; t)/T ,

and a and c are coeﬃcients;

∇2 is the 2d gradient:

∇2 = (∂x, ∂y).

We deﬁne a smooth disturbance by the condition

is the transverse size of the medium. Under this condition, the
second term in on the right-hand side of (1) is much smaller than the ﬁrst. We keep it
θ symmetry. As we
nonetheless, because it is the leading term that breaks the θ
will see, terms breaking this symmetry play an important role in evolution of non-smooth
disturbances, such as topological defects. So, it is essential to establish that the coeﬃcient
c is indeed nonzero. For smooth disturbances, though, the second term is unimportant, and
eq. (1) shows that when a > 0 a smooth initial disturbance relaxes back to the uniform
steady rhythm (θ = const). The relaxation process is ordinary diﬀusion.

→ −

It is important to provide a derivation of (1) from an electrophysiological model.
In
particular, that would supply certain values for the yet unknown coeﬃcients a and c. In
Sect. 2 we show how θ (or τ ) can be deﬁned within such a model. The smaller are gradients
of θ, the slower it evolves. One might think that, given an electrophysiological model, it
should be easy to separate away the slow dynamics and obtain, quite generally, a closed
equation for θ. This task, however, turns out to be far from straightforward, and as of this
writing we have not been able to obtain a general derivation of (1); in Sect. 2 we illustrate
the nature of the diﬃculty.

To establish that the coeﬃcient c is indeed nonzero, we then have resorted to the following
argument. The simple electrophysiological model that we consider can be driven, by a choice
of the parameters, to a critical (bifurcation) point, at which the autonomous rhythmic
activity is extinguished. Near the critical point, the system can be described by a complex

3

Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) model of a complex order parameter whose phase is our time-
delay ﬁeld θ. For a smooth, almost uniform, perturbation, the CGL description reduces
to an equation for θ alone, and that has the precise form (1), with deﬁnite values of a
and c. In particular, we ﬁnd that a > 0 and c
= 0. As we move away from the critical
point and towards the form of activity representative of the normal heartbeat, the CGL
description ceases to be valid. But as it is diﬃcult to imagine how c would now suddenly
become identically zero, we assume that the large-time dynamics of θ is still described by
(1) with a nonzero c. We also assume that a > 0, so that the uniform state is stable. The
electrophysiological model that we use is reviewed in Sect. 3, and the CGL description is
derived in Sect. 4.

The second step of our program is promoting the above description of smooth pertur-
bations to a description including not-so-smooth perturbations, in particular, topological
defects. The latter description will not be universal. The lack of universality means (by
deﬁnition) that the description, and the type of the resulting dynamics, depend on the mi-
crostructure of the medium. Because no activity can be ﬁne-grained indeﬁnitely, it is natural
to assume a granular, or lattice, structure. In Sect. 5, we construct lattice models and study
their dynamics. In Sect. 6 we summarize our results.

II. DESCRIPTION OF SMOOTH DISTURBANCES

In this section we want to show how the slow variable θ, or equivalently τ , can be deﬁned
within the context of an electrophysiological model. This variable evolves arbitrarily slow
in the limit of arbitrarily small gradients; it should not be confused with “slow” recovery
variables of electrophysiology. Our deﬁnition of τ works for any medium supporting an
autonomous periodic activity that is stable with respect to smooth, almost uniform, pertur-
bations. For deﬁniteness, we consider here an electrophysiological equation of the form

is the 3d gradient, and ǫ and b are parameters.
Overhead dots denote time derivatives,
The change in properties of the medium in the z direction is described by the function F ,
which explicitly depends on z. Eq. (4) obtains, for instance, when a medium described by
the two-variable FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model [5] is placed in an external static electric
ﬁeld (we will show that below). In that case, g is the deviation of the recovery variable of
the FHN model from the static solution.

∇

(4)

We consider cases when eq. (4) (or, more precisely, a suitable boundary problem based

on it) has a periodic in time solution of the form

g(r, t) = φ(z, t) .

(5)

For example, this solution may describe a train of pulses propagating in the z direction.
The periodicity means that φ(z, t + T ) = φ(z, t) for some period T . Notice that, because of
τ ) is also a solution of (4), for any real τ
the translational invariance of (4) in time, φ(z, t
(albeit with diﬀerent initial conditions). We now consider a smooth (in space) perturbation
of the periodic activity described by (5) and assume that a suﬃciently smooth perturbation
relaxes back to the periodic state. After the relaxation has been under way for a while, we

−

4

expect that deviations of g from φ are already small—except perhaps in the softest mode,
associated with the time translation. We thus seek a solution to (4) of the form

g(r, t) = φ(z, t

τ (r, t)) + χ(r, t) ,

−

(6)

→

where τ (r, t) is a slowly changing (on the scale of the period T ) function of time:
τ /T .
In the limit ˙τ
0, we should return to the solution (5) merely shifted in time, so in this
limit χ should vanish. Thus, when ˙τ is small, χ is also small, although not necessarily slowly
changing. Because of the periodicity of φ in time, τ (r, t) is a phase variable: at each spatial
point, it is deﬁned modulo the period T . The condition that the perturbation be smooth
reduces this ambiguity to a common shift by T in the entire space.

≪

˙τ

Note that separation of a perturbation into τ and χ is not completely deﬁned by (6): a
time-dependent variation in τ can be absorbed by a variation in χ. This ambiguity can be
ﬁxed by an additional condition—for instance, by requiring that χ is orthogonal to ˙φ with
respect to a certain inner product. Eq. (6) together with the additional condition will then
provide a complete deﬁnition of the slow variable τ .

Now, let us illustrate the nature of the diﬃculty that arises when one tries to derive a
closed equation for τ from eq. (4). We substitute (6) into (4) and expand the right-hand
side to the leading order in small quantities—the function χ and the derivatives of τ . The
dependence on χ will be contained in an expression of the form ˆM(φ)χ, where ˆM is a linear
τ (r, t)). Because of the translational
operator, which acts on χ and depends on φ(z, t
invariance of (4) in time, the operator ˆM (φ) almost annihilates ˙φ(z, t

τ (r, t)):

where F is F (φ, ˙φ; z). This operator is clearly not Hermitean with respect to (8) with w = 1,
and indeed we have not found any weight that would render it Hermitean. Thus, we were
unable to directly separate the slow dynamics of τ from the fast dynamics of χ. While it
seems intuitively clear that the slow dynamics will be described by an equation of the form
(1), to establish that the coeﬃcients a and c are indeed both nonzero, we had to resort to
an indirect method, which we describe below.

III. A MODEL OF THE HEARTBEAT

In this section, we describe in some detail the pacemaking mechanism with which we
model the heartbeat. This simple model, based on the two-variable FitzHugh-Nagumo
(FHN) kinetics, will be suﬃcient for our argument justifying (4) with nonzero a and c.

corresponding linear stability analysis introduces a number of useful deﬁnitions, so we brieﬂy
go over it here.

the thickness of the slab in the z direction. This represents the thickness of the ventricles
in our simpliﬁed model. We have done numerical simulations with Lz = 3.2. For lengths,
Ref. [7] recommends scaling by a factor of 0.5 cm. A somewhat smaller scaling factor of
0.2 cm is obtained if we equate the characteristic (“Debye”) length ξ = 0.57, at which a

boundary problem (16)–(17) and check the condition (23). Alternatively, one can numeri-
cally integrate the time-dependent problem (10)–(12) with initial conditions corresponding
to small ﬂuctuations near the static solution. This second approach also allows one to ﬁnd
the form of the time-dependent attractor emerging as the instability is cutoﬀ by nonlinear
eﬀects, so we have adopted it. For the purposes of this section, it is suﬃcient to consider
initial ﬂuctuations that are independent of x and y. Using numerical integrations of (10)–
(12) with such initial conditions and with the above values of the parameters, we have found

Near the upper critical ﬁeld, which from now on we will call the critical point, the ﬁelds
e(r, t) = E(r, t)
G0(z) are small (E0 and G0 denote the
static solution). Expanding the system (10)–(11) in e and g so as to retain the leading

We stay closely enough to the critical point, so that on that side of it where the static
solution is unstable there will be only one λn satisfying the instability condition (23). That
will be λ0. In what follows we only consider cases when ǫ < 1/b2. Then, the instability
condition takes the form

γ0 < 0 ,

where γ0 = b + λ0/ǫ is the friction coeﬃcient (22) for n = 0. The closer the system is to the
critical point, the smaller is
. We make it small enough, so that the frequency squared
(21) with n = 0 (and hence with all n > 0 as well) is positive and much larger than γ2

Recall that the condition of instability of the static solution is γ0 < 0, and near the critical

solution exists only when sR > 0. For a smooth perturbation of this uniform activity (which,
in particular, contains no topological defects), we can deﬁne the modulus ρ(r2, t) and the
phase θ(r2, t) via

Ψ(r2, t) = ρ(r2, t) exp(

Substituting this into eq. (33) shows that θ measures the phase shifts in periodic activity
among local regions, so it is precisely the variable that we deﬁned in Sect. 2. As the modulus
ρ relaxes close to ρ
ρ0 everywhere in the 2d space, eq. (45) reduces to an equation for the
phase θ alone. That equation is of the form (1), with a = ReD, and c =

ImD.

V. CONSTRUCTION OF LATTICE MODELS

As we move away from the critical point and towards the form of activity that is more
representative of the normal heartbeat, the CGL description ceases to be valid. Nevertheless,
we expect that eq. (1) will still apply for suﬃciently smooth perturbations. That is because
θ is the only variable that can change arbitrarily slowly (for arbitrarily small gradients), and
the two terms on the right-hand side of (1) are the only two terms of the lowest (second)
order in gradients that are consistent with the symmetries of our model and the assumption
that θ does not depend on z. Moreover, we now have a reason to believe that both coeﬃcients
a and c will be nonzero: we have seen that they were both nonzero near the critical point,
and it is hard to imagine how either of them would vanish identically when we move away.
So, we consider eq. (1) to be reasonably well justiﬁed.

The next step is to build upon (1) to construct models that would apply to not-so-smooth
perturbations of the normal rhythm, in particular, to those containing topological defects.
As we consider perturbations of progressively smaller spatial scales, there are two eﬀects

11

that lead to deviations from (1). On the one hand, the granular (lattice) structure of the
medium becomes important; on the other hand, the local form of activity deviates from its
unperturbed form, so that other variables besides θ come into play. We have found that
the resulting dynamics depends crucially on which of these two eﬀects becomes important
ﬁrst, i.e. at larger spatial scales. In what follows, we contrast the corresponding two types
of the dynamics. Finding out which one is realized in a speciﬁc medium will require a
detailed electrophysiological model. The required model will have to include the details of
the granular structure, so it cannot be a simple continuum model of the type we used to
justify eq. (1).

First, consider the case when the local activity is very rigid in maintaining its form. That
means that each grain—or lattice site—still carries on essentially the undisturbed activity,
so the ﬁeld θ remains the only requisite variable. In this case, the dynamics is described
by a model of classical lattice XY spins. For deﬁniteness, we consider here a model on a
square lattice, with interactions restricted to the nearest neighbors (NN). (Similar results
were obtained for a model that includes interactions of next-to-nearest neighbors.) We take
the model equation in the form

∂tθi = h−2

Xj∈NN(i)

[a sin(θj −

θi) + c(1

cos(θj −

−

θi))] .

(50)

The index i labels the sites of a 2d square lattice, and h is the lattice spacing. Matching to
the long-wave limit (1) identiﬁes a and c in (50) with those in (1).

Near the critical point, c/a =

b/ω0, which is proportional to the small √ǫ. Away from
the critical point, however, there is no reason to expect
to be small, and we need to
explore the dynamics of the model for diverse values of this ratio. We assume that a > 0
and set a = 1 by a rescaling of time.

When c = 0, eq. (50) becomes the usual diﬀusive XY model. This model has stable
topological defects—vortices and antivortices. A nonzero c gives these defects a rotation
(clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the sign of c), so vortices and antivortices

become spirals. By numerically integrating (50), we have found that for small values of

these spirals are stable—or at least no instability could be detected during ﬁnite times of
our computer runs.

As

is increased, the spirals become more tightly wound and at a suﬃciently large

they become unstable. Formation of a tightly wound but still stable spiral is illustrated by
Figs. 1, 2. Fig. 1 shows an initial state, containing a single vortex, and Fig. 2 shows the
0.5. The values of θ at a given
spiral that develops from that initial state for a = 1 and c =
time are represented as directions of lattice spins, as measured clockwise from 12 noon [8].
These results were obtained via Euler’s explicit time-stepping scheme on a 33
33 lattice
with side length L = 10 and discretized Neumann boundary conditions. For picture clarity,
only a 22

22 square is shown.

Evolution of an unstable defect is illustrated by Fig. 3. This picture was obtained for
a = 1 and c =
2 on the same lattice and with the same initial condition as Fig. 2. The
center of the defect now serves as a nuclei of a new phase, a featureless turbulent state. A
bubble of the new phase originates at the center of the defect and rapidly grows, eating up
the “normal” phase, until the new phase occupies the entire volume. As far as we can tell,
the resulting turbulent state is persistent. Fig. 3 shows the bubble during its growth. This

−

12

growth is indeed so rapid that the initial vortex does not have time to fully develop into a
spiral, although some fragments of spiral structure can be seen near the wall of the bubble.
A patch of the turbulent state is seen inside the bubble, away from the wall. When the
turbulent state occupies the entire volume, it remains disordered: directions of the spins are
uncorrelated beyond a few lattice spacings. In addition, spins in the turbulent state rapidly
change their directions with time.

Next, we consider a case when the local activity is ﬂexible, i.e. it readily changes its form
in response to a short-scale perturbation. For instance, we can supply the lattice spins with
a variable length by making θ the phase of a complex ﬁeld Φ =
exp(iθ). This introduces
an additional degree of freedom associated with

stable in a certain range of its parameters [9]. Numerically integrating discretized eq. (51),
we have found that by varying r, for a ﬁxed c/a, one can interpolate between the unstable
spirals of a lattice model with ﬁxed-length spins and the stable spirals of the continuum
CGL model.

VI. CONCLUSION

In this paper we tried to implement consistently the idea that a disturbance in the normal
heartbeat can be viewed as a collection of “clocks”, each of which measures the local phase
In conjunction with the view that the heart has a granular (or lattice)
of the activity.
structure, this idea leads to a description of the heart via lattice models of classical spins.
Our main results are as follows.

(i) Assuming that suﬃciently smooth (almost uniform across the medium) disturbances
of the normal rhythm relax back to it, one can write down a universal description of this
relaxation process. Universality means that the form of the equation is independent of details
of microscopics. For a simpliﬁed model of the heartbeat, and disturbances depending only on
the transverse (with respect to the direction of pulse propagation) coordinates, the universal
description is eq. (1). Although we have not derived this equation in the general case, we
have justiﬁed it by presenting a derivation near a critical (bifurcation) point.

(ii) For not-so-smooth disturbances, including topological defects, dynamics begins to
depend on the assumed lattice structure and the details of electrophysiology. In particular,
we have found that it depends strongly on how rigid the local activity is in maintaining
its form. When the activity is very rigid (ﬁxed length spins), the system, for a range of

13

the parameter space, is prone to a defect-induced instability, which leads to a disordered,
turbulent state.

We expect that the local rigidity of the medium (in the above sense) will depend on its
longitudinal size (the thickness of the ventricles) and on the electrophysiological parameters,
such as Na and K conductances. Since, according to our results, the local rigidity plays
such an important role in the transition to turbulence (ﬁbrillation), its dependence on the
parameters may serve to identify useful therapeutic targets.

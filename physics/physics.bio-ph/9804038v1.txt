Abstract

Switching model with one predator and two prey species is considered. The prey
species have the ability of group defence. Therefore, the predator will be attracted
towards that habitat where prey are less in number. The stability analysis is carried
out for two equilibrium values. The theoretical results are compared with the numer-
ical results for a set of values. The Hopf bifuracation analysis is done to support the
stability results.

1. Introduction

Among related herbivore species, individuals of smaller species like Dik-dik will be vul-
nerable to a greater range of predator species and are less likely than larger to be able
to defend themselves against, or to out run, predators. All small species avoid being
detected by predators. Smaller species are likely to have to seek carefully their scare,
scattered food item of high quality and form less cohesive and coordinated feeding groups.
They live singly or in pairs and find their resources within a defended territory. Because
they are small and vulnerable, they move and feed cautiously and slowly and never move
far from cover. The size of the territory is presumably determined by the area that a pair
can defend and by the availability of suitable food at the season of greatest scarcity. These
species characteristically remain in one vegetation type in all seasons.

Larger species individuals feeding upon abundant, evenly dispersed, easily found items,
are likely to be tolerating low quality food. They form enormous, rather formless, feeding
aggregations of many thousands of animals. Major predators of zebra, buffalo, kongoni,
toki and Thomson’s gazelle are hyena, wild dog, lion, leopard and cheetas. They form

groups for defence against predators and more likely depend upon self-defence, group
defence, group alertness within a group and speed, to avoid being killed by a predator.
Dense vegetation and broken terrain disrupt visual communication, and flat open coun-
try favour it. So such groups are more likely to be found where visual communication is
favoured and where individuals can conform to the group, speed, and direction of move-
ment. Unless the group remains cohesive and coordinated, the individual risks becoming
an outstanding target. At all times individuals in groups must remain in communication
and their speeds and directions when moving must vary little between individuals. Group
defence is a term used to describe a phenomenon whereby predation is decreased or even
prevented altogether by the ability of the prey population to better defend or disguise
themselves when their number is large. Aggregation tends to reduce the risk of predation
through simple dilution. Hence, doubling the local density of herbivores while predator
density remains unchanged could lead to a halving of the mortality risk Hamilton [1],
Bertram [2]. Of course, this assumes that predators do not seek out areas with very large
prey density Schaller [3]. Pairs of musk-oxen can be successfully attacked by wolves but
groups are rarely attacked Tener [4]. There are many examples of group defence – Yang
and Humphrey [5], May and Robinson [6], Holmes and Bethel [7]. Herds remain well
coordinated even under attack and individuals may benefit from the alertness and com-
munication within the herd. Individuals tend to conform with their neighbour activities,
and many hundreds, even thousands of wildebeest can coordinate rapidly in response to
an alarm. Large groups also benefit from increased probability of detection of predators.
The hunting success of lions decline if the group size of prey is large Van Orsdol [8]. Chee-
tah prefer to hunt single animals. Coursing predators select less healthy, old, sick and
young prey and those who have lost their herds during migrations due to various reasons.
Animals in poor condition and without group may reduce vigilance rates.

Each year, some one million wildebeest migrate across the Serengeti mara ecosystem
D. Kreulen [9]. The crude cost of this movement, relative to neighbouring resident pop-
ulations of wildebeest, is a 3% increment in mortality per year Sinclair [10]. The overall
migratory pattern is thought to be related to food supply, which is itself dependent on an
uneven distribution of rainfall Grzimek and Grzimek [11], Talbot and Talbot [12], Ander-
son and Talbot [13], Pennywick [14], Maddock [15]. In the dry season, they need to drink
Jarman [16] and most home ranges include some riverbank habitat, which is preferentially
used during that season. At the start of wet season, they move away from the rivers to oc-
cupy the woodlands where they feed predominantly on new green grass leaves, with some
herbs, many of these plants may be annuals. As grasses mature and rains cease, their
diet starts to include progressively more browse and they move into plant communities
where browse is more. Movements could also be influenced by change in requirements
for specific nutrients. Kreulen [17] noted that Serengeti wildebeest on their wet season
range preferred a short-grass over a long grass habitat, and that calcium concentration
were higher on the short grassland. Migration has also been attributed to the wildebeest’s
dislike of wet and sticky ground Talbot and Talbot [12], Anderson and Talbot [13]. In
this way herbivores maximize the growth potential of the vegetation through rotational
grazing where the two concentration areas are sufficiently far apart, the movements are
called seasonal migrations.

In predator-prey environment, the predator prefers to feed itself in a habitat for some
duration and then changes its preference to another habitat. This preferential phenomenon

214

Q.J.A. Khan, B.S. Bhatt and R.P. Jaju

of change of habitat by the predator is called switching. There may be several reasons of
switching of predators. For example – predator prefers to catch prey species in a habitat
where they are in abundance but after some duration of heavy predation, when the prey
species population starts declining, the predator changes its preference to another habitat.
In this habitat prey species are more in number due to less predation i.e. the predator feeds
preferentially on the most numerous prey species habitat. This is found to be the case
when prey species is relatively smaller in size with little or insignificant defence capability
with respect to predator, like small antelope and cruising predators to locate prey. Many
examples may be cited where a predator prefers to prey species that is most abundant at
any time, see Fisher-Piette [18], Lawton et al. [19] and Murdoch [20]. The mathematical
models which have been generally proposed with such type of predator switching are those
involving one predator with two prey species, e.g., Holling [21], Takashi [22], May [23],
Murdoch and Oaten [24], and Raughgarden and Feldman [25], Tanskey [26, 27], Prajneshu
and Holgate [28], Teramoto et al [29].

We are motivated by Serengeti ecosystem which can be divided into two habitats for
wild life – (a) open southern grasslands with low rainfall that support a relatively low
biomass of short-growing grasses and (b) wooded northern grasslands with higher rainfall
that support tall, highly lignified grasses Braun [30], McNaughton [31, 32]. Rainfall is a
key factor influencing primary productivity in both grassland types Braun [30] Sinclair
[33]. McNaughton [31, 32] . All of the migratory species (wildebeest, zebra, and Thom-
son’s gazelle) show similar seasonal shifts in habitats, using short grassland in the south
during wet season and tall grasslands in the north during dry season Pennywick [14] and
Maddock [15]. Their long range movements roughly correspond to seasonal transitions.
We have considered a system having a predator species interacting with same prey species
in two habitats. Prey is able to migrate among two different habitats at some cost to the
population in the sense that the probability of survival during a change of habitat may
be less than one. The predator can feed on either habitats. The prey species in both
habitats have the ability of group defence but it will be effective in the habitat where the
population of prey is large. The predator will be attracted toward s that habitat where
prey are less in number.

Freedman and Walkowicz [34] considered a predator-prey system in which the prey
population exhibits group defence. They described that if the carrying capacity of the
prey population is sufficiently large and there is no mutual interference among predators
then the predator population always goes to extinction. Freedman and Quan [35] studied
predator-prey system with third population extinction. Shigui Ruan and Freedman [36]
analyzed group defence in Gause-type models for three species. They gave criteria for
persistence when there is no mutual interference and when there is mutual interference
of predators. Freedman and Shigui Ruan [37] have discussed a three species food chain
model with group defence. They have shown that model undergoes a sequence of Hopf
bifurcations, using the carrying capacity of the environment as a bifurcation parameter.

This paper is organized as follows – Model formulation is in Section 2 and equilibrium
and stability is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 includes Hopf bifurcation analysis with
respect to δ (conversion rates of prey to predator) and ν (death rate of the predator).
Bifurcation points and effect on stability for selected numerical data values are in Section 5.
Final discussion and results are summarized in Section 6.

, and X1(t), X2(t) are prey species in the first and second habitats re-

spectively and Y (t) denote predator species which feed upon X1 and X2. Prey species are
able to disperse among 2 different habitats at some cost to the population. Prey have the
ability of group defence, so predator will go towards the habitats where prey population
is less numerically. We consider that in the beginning, prey species are less in habitat
1 and so predator will be attracted towards them. For giving protection to their mates
the prey species of the habitat 2 will rush towards habitat 1. In this way their strength
in the habitat 2 will fall short and the predators will be attracted towards them. So to
protect them prey start coming from hibitats 1 to 2. This implies a kind of switching from
one habitat source of food to another habitat as the prey fall short alternately. Due to
seasonal migration of prey species, none of the habitat population will be extinct. This
situation is described by the above model where

βi : Predator response rates towards the two prey X1 and X2 respectively.

δi : The rate of conversion of prey to predator.

ǫi : Inverse barrier strength in going out of the first habitat and the second habitat.
pij : The probability of successful transition from ith habitat to jth habitat.

αi : Specific growth rate of the prey in the absence of predation.

ν : Per capita death rate of predator.

We assume that βi, δi, ǫi, pij, αi, and ν are positive constants and ǫ1p12 > β2Y (0),

ǫ2p21 > β1Y (0), so that the X1 and X2 are not negative.

3. Analytical Solution

In this section, we proceed to analyze the system (2.1). We examine the equilibrium of
this system. We obtain equilibrium solutions by setting time derivatives to zero.
If in
equations (2.1) ¯X1, ¯X2, ¯Y are the equilibrium values of X1, X2, Y respectively, there are
two possible equilibria, namely,

¯X1 = ¯X2 = ¯Y = 0,

i.e., population is extinct and this always exists.

4. Hopf Bifurcation Analysis

We investigate the Hopf bifurcation for the system (2.1) taking δ1, δ2 and ν as the bifur-
cation parameters.

First, we determine the criteria for Hopf bifurcation using δ1 (rate of conversion of prey
in the habitat 1 to predator) as the bifurcation parameter. For non zero equilibrium we
look at the characteristic equation (3.7).

For A < 0, B < 0, C > 0,

and D > 0;

218

Q.J.A. Khan, B.S. Bhatt and R.P. Jaju

a1, a2 and a3 are positive in (3.8), clearly (3.7) has two purely imaginary roots iff a1a2 = a3
for some value of δ1 (say δ1 = ¯δ1). There exists a unique ¯δ1 such that a1a2 = a3.
Therefore there is only one value of δ1 at which we have a Hopf bifurcation. Thus in the
neighbourhood of ¯δ1 the characteristic equation (3.7) cannot have real positive roots. For
δ1 = ¯δ1, we have

We can get a similar result when δ2 is taken as a bifurcation parameter. Therefore the

predator).

The last 2 columns give the values of δ1/δ2 at which the model is stable or unstable.
In fact fourth column gives the bifurcation point (where the model is stable, below/above
that value the model is unstable/stable). In the appendix we show that these bifurcation
points are in fact Hopf bifurcation points. We have also done computations to see the
effect of ν on the stability when β1 > β2. It is interesting to find that the model is either
stable or unstable with respect to δ′s. and Hopf bifurcation does not exist with respect
to ν.

One can try similar analysis with respect to other parameters also.
The set of equations given in (2.1) have been numerically integrated for four cases given

in Table II with other parameters as given in Table I.

These sets were picked up while doing the computations of analytical results in previous
section where the behaviour of the model is shown in the last column. The initial condi-
tions used are the corresponding equilibrium values in each case with slight perturbations.
Figures 1 to 4 give the behaviour of X1, X2 and Y with respect to t in above four cases
and as expected we get stable behaviour in the figures 1 and 2 and unstable behaviour
in the figures 3 and 4. Figures 5 to 8 give the prey-predator dynamics when the model
is stable whereas figures 9 to 12 represent the prey-predator dynamics when the model is
unstable. These contours also support the predictions of Table II.

Switching Model with Two Habitats and Group Defence

6. Summary and Discussion

We have considered a system having a predator species interacting with prey species in
two habitats. Prey is of large size and migrate between two different habitats at some cost
to its population in the sense that the probability of survival during a change of habitat
is less than one. The predator can feed on either habitats. The prey species in both
habitats have the ability of group defence but it will be effective in the habitat where the
population of prey is large. Due to group defence ability of the prey, predator will select
the habitat where prey might have insufficient defending capability (i.e. numerically less,
old, sick, some youngs and those who might have lost their group during migration due
to various reasons). The stability analysis has been carried out for both zero and nonzero
equilibrium values. Nonzero equilibrium ¯X1 and ¯X2 for prey in first and second habitats
depends on the death rate of predators i.e. if the death rate of the predator is high then
values of ¯X1 and ¯X2 will increase or vice versa.
¯X1 and ¯X2 values will decrease if the
predator response towards both habitats increases respectively. Nonzero equilibrium will
be stable if it satisfies all three conditions of equation (3.9). Consider first the limit where
ǫ1
0, there is no movement of prey in or out of both habitat and so values of
A and B in (3.9)1, will be positive and nonzero equilibrium will become unstable. Hence,
increasing the values of ǫ1 and ǫ2 always stabilizes. We can conclude from (3.9)2 that
stability increases for increasing values of conversion rate of prey species by predator.
From (3.9)3 we see that if ¯X2 > ¯X1 then for stability it is more likely β1 > β2 provided
BD
if the equilibrium value of prey species in second habitat
AC
is more than first habitat then predator will attract towards first habitat because prey
exhibits group defence and our model predicts this behaviour.

Hopf bifurcation analysis has been carried out for both models with respect to λ (con-
version rate of prey to predator) as a parameter. In the sense of ecology, Hopf bifurcation
has helped us in finding the existence of a region of instability in the neighbourhood of
nonzero equilibrium, where prey species in both the habitats and predator will survive
undergoing regular fluctuations. However, the conditions of Hopf bifurcation might not
be satisfied due to changes in other parameters and change the steady state or otherwise.

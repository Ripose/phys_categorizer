The two-vibron dynamics associated to amide-I vibrations in a 3D α-helix is described according to
a generalized Davydov model. The helix is modeled by three spines of hydrogen-bonded peptide units
linked via covalent bonds. It is shown that the two-vibron energy spectrum supports both a two-
vibron free states continuum and two kinds of bound states, called TVBS-I and TVBS-II, connected
to the trapping of two vibrons onto the same amide-I mode and onto two nearest neighbor amide-I
modes belonging to the same spine, respectively. At low temperature, non vanishing interspine
hopping constants yield a three dimensional nature of both TVBS-I and TVBS-II which the wave
functions extend over the three spines of the helix. At biological temperature, the pairs are conﬁned
in a given spine and exhibit the same features as the bound states described within a one-dimensional
model. The interplay between the temperature and the 3D nature of the helix is also responsible
for the occurrence of a third bound state called TVBS-III which refers to the trapping of two
vibrons onto two diﬀerent spines. The experimental signature of the existence of bound states is
discussed through the simulation of their infrared pump-probe spectroscopic response. Finally, the
fundamental question of the breather-like behavior of two-vibron bound states is addressed.

INTRODUCTION

In low-dimensional molecular lattices, the nonlinear
nature of vibrational excitons (vibrons) plays a key role
for energy transfer as well as energy storage in both phys-
ical, chemical and biological systems. This feature has
become more and more central during the last decade
through the concept of discrete breathers [1, 2, 3]. In clas-
sical anharmonic lattices, discrete breathers correspond
to time-periodic and spatially localized solutions which
result from the interplay between the discreteness and
the nonlinearity. These solutions do not require integra-
bility for their existence and stability and it has been
suggested that they should correspond to quite general
and robust solutions. Since discrete breathers yield a lo-
cal accumulation of the vibrational energy which might
be pinned in the lattice or may travel through it, they
are expected to be of fundamental importance.

At present, because the occurrence of classical
breathers is a relatively well understood phenomena, a
great attention is done to characterize their quantum
equivalent for which less numerous results are known
[4]. In that context, bound states involving two high fre-
quency vibrational excitons, also called two-vibron bound
states (TVBS), play a central role. When two vibrons are
excited, the vibrational anharmonicity is responsible for
the trapping of the two quanta over only a few sites with
a resulting energy which is lesser than the energy of two
quanta lying far apart. The lateral interaction yields a
motion of such a state from one site to another, thus
leading to the occurrence of a delocalized wave packet

with a well-deﬁned momentum. As a result, TVBS are
the ﬁrst quantum states which experience the nonlinear-
ity and can thus be viewed as the quantum counterpart
of breathers or soliton excitations [5, 6, 7, 8].

The present paper is thus devoted to the characteri-
zation of the TVBS associated to the amide-I vibrations
in a 3D α-helix. Since the pionneer work of Davydov
[9, 10], the delocalization of amide-I vibrations yields the
occurrence of vibrons which are expected to play a funda-
mental role for the transport of the energy released by the
hydrolysis of adenosine triphophate [11, 12]. More pre-
cisely, the energy transfer is achieved by small polarons
which originate in the strong coupling between the vi-
brons and the phonons of the helix [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. A
small polaron corresponds to a vibron dressed by a vir-
tual cloud of phonons describing a localized lattice dis-
tortion which follows instantaneously the vibron.

In the paper I of this series, the single-vibron states
in a 3D model of an α-helix [18] have been character-
ized.
It has been shown that the vibron dynamics re-
sults from the competition between two kinds of hop-
ping processes. The ﬁrst kind refers to vibrational tran-
sitions between diﬀerent spines whereas the second kind
involves vibron hops along the same spine. This study
has revealed that several parameters such as the tem-
perature, the small polaron binding energy and the helix
backbone conformation, allow for a transition between
two regimes. At low temperature or weak small polaron
binding energy, the polaron behaves as an undressed vi-
bron delocalized between the diﬀerent spines. By con-
trast, at biological temperature or strong small polaron
binding energy, the dressing eﬀect strongly reduces the
vibrational exchanges between diﬀerent spines so that the
polaron tends to propagate along a single spine, only. Al-
though the phonon spectrum exhibits both an acoustic
branch and an optical branch, it has been shown that the

previous features originate in the coupling between the
vibrons and the acoustic phonons.

In recent works [19, 20], TVBS have been studied
within the 1D model of an α-helix in which the vibron
dynamics is reduced to that of a single spine of hydrogen-
bound peptide unit. In that case, it has been shown that
both the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide-I
vibration and the strong vibron-phonon interaction act as
nonlinear sources which break the vibron independence
and favor the formation of two kinds of bound states.
In the harmonic situation, the two bound states appear
as combinations of states involving the trapping of the
two vibrons onto the same amide-I mode and onto near-
est neighbor amide-I modes in a given spine. By con-
trast, the intramolecular anharmonicity reduces the hy-
bridization between these two kinds of trapping so that
the low frequency bound state refers to the trapping of
the two vibrons onto the same amide-I mode whereas
the high frequency bound state characterizes the trap-
ping onto nearest neighbor amide-I vibrations in a given
spine. These results were corroborated by the pump-
probe spectroscopy experiment of the N-H mode in a
stable α-helix which has revealed the two excited state
absorption bands connected to the two kinds of bound
states [21, 22].

The present paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II,
the model to describe the vibron-phonon dynamics in 3D
α-helices is introduced. Then, the procedure to remove
the intramolecular anharmonicity and to renormalize the
vibron-phonon interaction in order to obtain the dressed
anharmonic vibron Hamiltonian is summarized. Finally,
the number states method used to solve the two-vibron
Schrodinger equation is outlined. In Sec. III, a detailed
analysis of the two-vibron energy spectrum is performed
depending on the values taken by the relevant parameters
of the problem. The results are discussed and interpreted
in Sec. IV.

II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

As pointed out in the introduction, the two-vibron dy-
namics is strongly sensitive to the nonlinear nature of
the vibron-phonon system. In α-helices, this nonlinear-
ity originates from both the intramolecular anharmonic-
ity of each amide-I vibration and from the strong vibron-
phonon coupling . In the present section, we thus brieﬂy
summarize the model described in paper I [18] and in-
troduce the anharmonic nature of each amide-I mode ac-
cording to the 1D model detailed in Ref. [19].

A. Helix structure and model Hamiltonian

Let us consider a sequence of N amino acid units
(called residues) regularly distributed along a polypep-
tide chain and let n the index which labels the position
of the nth residue. In three dimension, the structure of

2

the polypeptide chain is stabilized by the hydrogen bonds
between the residues n and n + 3. The resulting confor-
mation is a 3D α-helix in which each residue is related
to the next one by a translation of h = 1.5 ˚A and by a
rotation of θ0 = 100o leading to 3.6 residues per turn of
helix. The N residues are assumed to behave as point-
like entities which the equilibrium positions are located
on sites distributed along the helix which the radius is
ﬁxed to R0 = 2.8 ˚A [10]. The geometry of the helix is
thus speciﬁed in the (xyz) cartesian frame where the z
direction is parallel to the axis of the helix (see Fig. 1a
in paper I [18]).

The nth site contains a amide-I vibration which be-
haves as an internal high frequency oscillator described
by the standard creation and annihilation vibron opera-
tors b+
n and bn. By introducing the intramolecular anhar-
monicity of each amide-I mode, the vibron Hamiltonian
is written as (within the convention ~=1)

amide-I mode and where J(n
hopping constant between the residues n and n′.
In
Eq.(1), γ3 and γ4 represent the cubic and quartic an-
harmonic parameters of each amide-I mode.

−

The amide-I vibrations interact with the phonons of
the helix which corresponds to the dynamics of the ex-
ternal motions of the residues. As detailed in paper
I [18], this dynamics is expressed in N local frames
(er(n), eθ(n), ez(n)) attached to each residue (see Fig.
1b in paper I [18]) so that the displacement of the nth
residue in the nth local frame corresponds to a Bloch
wave with wave vector k [24]. Therefore, the normal
mode decomposition is achieved by performing the di-
3) dynamical matrix D(k) for
agonalization of a (3
each k value. Such a procedure allows us to deﬁne three
kσ and three eigenvectors ǫkσ labeled by the
eigenvalues Ω2
index σ = 1, 2, 3 associated to the 3D nature of the he-
lix. The two indexes k and σ specify a particular phonon
mode with energy ~Ωkσ, quasi-momentum ~k and po-
larization ǫkσ. The quantum dynamics of each mode is
described by the creation a†
kσ and annihilation akσ opera-
tors so that the phonon Hamiltonian is written as (within
the convention ~ = 1)

Finally, according to the Davydov model, the vibron-
phonon interaction originates in the modulation of the
vibrational frequency of each amide-I vibration by the
external motion of the residues. Within the deforma-
tion potential approximation, the vibron-phonon cou-
pling Hamiltonian is written in terms of the phonon nor-

mal mode coordinates as

with the phonon mode speciﬁed by the wave vector k and

between the nth amide-I mode and the external displace-
ment of the n′th residue and Ck(m) is a vector which
account for the helix geometry and which is deﬁned in
Eq.(16) of paper I [18].

B. Eﬀective Hamiltonian for the two-vibron
dynamics

The vibron-phonon dynamics is described by the full
Hamiltonian H = Hv + Hp + ∆Hvp which cannot be
solved exactly due to the nonlinear sources. Neverthe-
less, as detailed in Ref.
[19] and outlined in paper I, it
can be expressed in an improved way by performing two
unitary transformations. First, by following Kimball et
[6], a unitary transformation is applied to remove
al.
the intramolecular anharmonicity of each amide-I mode.
Then, a modiﬁed Lang-Firsov transformation is realized
to renormalize a part of the vibron-phonon interaction
[25]. Finally, a mean ﬁeld procedure is applied to sepa-
rate the vibron degrees of freedom from the phonon co-
ordinates in the residual coupling so that the eﬀective
dressed anharmonic vibron Hamiltonian is written as

As clearly shown in Eq.(5), the nonlinear sources
strongly modify the dynamics of the dressed anharmonic
vibrons. They are ﬁrst responsible for a redshift of each
amide-I frequency, i.e. ω0 →
ˆω0. Then, they lead to the
occurrence of coupling terms which break the vibron in-
dependence. The terms ˆAb+2
n b2
n′bnbn′
yield an attractive interaction between two vibrons and
favor their trapping around neighboring amide-I sites.
Finally, the nonlinearities modify the vibron hopping pro-
cesses via the dressing eﬀect which reduces the hopping
constants connecting two sites n and n′ according to the
dressing function Φnn′ . Note that the contributions pro-
portional to J2 characterize hops in the course of which
two vibrons realize simultaneously a transition whereas
the terms proportional to J3 aﬀect single-vibron hops
from states formed by two vibrons located onto the same
amide-I vibration. These two latter mechanism are spe-
ciﬁc of the two-vibron dynamics and do not occur in the
single-vibron dynamics. At this step let us mention that
the 3D nature of the helix provides a site dependent small
polaron binding energy EB(n) as well as a site dependent
n′, T ). As it will be discussed in
coupling constant S(n
the following section, these two features discriminate be-
tween interspine and intraspine processes for both vibron
hops and vibron-vibron interactions.

To characterize the two-vibron dynamics, the corre-
sponding Schrodinger equation ˆHef f |
has
to be solved. Since the Hamiltonian ˆHef f (Eq.(5)) con-
serves the number of vibrons, this can be achieved by
using the number states method [8] which was success-
fully applied to molecular adsorbates [26, 27, 28] and 1D
model of α-helices [19, 20]. Within this method, the two-
vibron wave function is expanded as

This basis set generates the entire two-vibron subspace
which the dimension N (N + 1)/2 represents the number
of ways for distributing two indistinguishable quanta onto
N sites.

The Schrodinger equation can be expressed in an im-
proved way by taking advantage of the helix symmetry.
Indeed, as for the phonon dynamics, the two-vibron wave
function is invariant under a rotation by an angle of θ0
around the helix axis followed by a translation along this
axis by a distance h. As a result, it can be expanded as
a Bloch wave as

Ψ(n1, n2 = n1 + m) =

eiK(n1+m/2)ΨK(m) (9)

√N

where the total momentum K, which takes N values be-
longing to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone of the helix, is asso-
ciated to the motion of the center of mass of the two
vibrons. Therefore, the resulting wave function ΨK(m)
refers to the degree of freedom m which characterizes
the distance between the two vibrons along the helix.
Since the momentum K is a good quantum number, the
Hamiltonian Hef f appears as block diagonal and the
Schrodinger equation can be solved for each K value.
This procedure, achieved numerically, allows us to de-
ﬁned a set of two-vibron eigenenergies ωKλ and a set of
two-vibron eigenstates ΨKλ(m) which are speciﬁed by
the index λ = 1, ..., (N + 1)/2 for each K value.

In the following section, this procedure is illustrated
to characterize the two-vibron energy spectrum of a 3D
α-helix.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

To describe the vibron dynamics in 3D α-helices, the
hopping constant along the hydrogen bonds is ﬁxed to
J(3) = 7.8 cm−1 [11, 16] whereas the hopping con-
stants between diﬀerent spines of hydrogen-bonded pep-
[29] are equal to J(1) =
tide units, calculated in Ref.
12.4 cm−1 and J(2) = 3.9 cm−1. The other elements
−
of the hopping matrix, rather small, are listed in the Ta-
ble I of Ref.
[29]. The harmonic frequency is ﬁxed to
ω0 = 1695 cm−1 and the anharmonic constant is equal
to A = 8.0 cm−1 [19, 30, 31]. The cubic and quartic
anharmonic parameters can be expressed approximately
by using the relation 15γ2
A [19]. Note that
3/ω0 ≈
6γ4 ≈
these parameter values are in a rather good agreement
with recent ab initio calculations [32].

As discussed in paper I [18], the harmonic dynamics of
the phonons is essentially governed by the force constant
K|n−n′| which refers to the second derivative of the pair
potential connecting the two residues located onto the
sites n and n′. The force constant K2 is set to zero and
we assume K|n| = 0 for n
4. The force constant of the
≥
hydrogen bonds is ﬁxed to K3 = 15 Nm−1 [11, 16, 19, 20,
23] whereas the force constant of the covalent bonds is

4

4.

equal to K1 = 60 Nm−1 [23]. Finally, the mass M which
enters the phonon dynamics has been ﬁxed to 2.0 10−25
kg. The strength of the vibron-phonon coupling Eq.(3)
is given by the parameters χ|n−n′| [18] which accounts
for the modulation of the nth amide-I frequency due to
the external motion of the n′th residue. According to the
1D Davydov model, the parameter χ3 ranges between 35
and 62 pN and we choose χ2 = 0 whereas we treat χ1 as
a parameter smaller than χ3 [23]. Note that χn = 0 for
n

≥
The two-vibron energy spectrum is shown in Figs. 1
for T = 5 K, χ1 = 25 pN and χ3 = 50 pN (EB(0) = 8.9
cm−1). The spectrum, centered onto the corrected fre-
quency 2ˆω0 (Eq.(6)), describes the two-vibron dispersion
curves drawn in half of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone of the he-
In the harmonic approximation,
lix, i.e. 0 < K < π.
i.e. A = 0 (Fig. 1a), the spectrum exhibits an energy
continuum located around 2ˆω0 with a bandwidth equal
to 101.9 cm−1. This continuum contains the states de-
scribing two independent vibrons and called two-vibron
free states (TVFS) [19]. For a given K value, a free state
refers to two independent vibrons with wave vectors q1
and q2 and energy ωq1 and ωq2 so that K = q1 + q2 and
ωKλ = ωq1 +ωq2. Below the continuum, the spectrum ex-
hibits two bands connected to two diﬀerent bound states.
The low frequency band, located below the TVFS over
the entire Brillouin zone, refers to bound states called
TVBS-I. The binding energy of TVBS-I, i.e. the gap be-
tween the zero wave vector TVBS-I and the bottom of the
TVFS continuum, is equal to 4.8 cm−1 whereas its band-
width is about 24.0 cm−1. The second band, which refers
to bound states denoted TVBS-II, lies below the con-
tinuum in a wave vector window which ranges between
K = 0.5 and K = 0.9. When the anharmonic parameter
is set to A = 8 cm−1 (Fig. 1b), the shape of the TVFS
continuum does not exhibit any signiﬁcant modiﬁcation.
Note that the center of the continuum is redshifted due
to the dependence of 2ˆω0 (Eq.(6)) on the anharmonic
parameter A (not drawn in the ﬁgure). Nevertheless,
the TVFS bandwidth is slightly reduced to 100.0 cm−1
so that the wave vector window for the occurrence of
the TVBS-II opens and ranges between K = 0.4 and
K = 1.0. By contrast, the anharmonicity strongly modi-
ﬁes the TVBS-I properties. It is responsible for a strong
redshift of the band as well as for a decrease of the band-
width. The TVBS-I binding energy reaches 15.3 cm−1
whereas the bandwidth is reduced to 19.0 cm−1.

Figs. 2 displays the TVBS wave function ΨKλ(m) cor-
responding to the situation described in Figs. 1. Figures
2a and 2b show the zero wave vector TVBS-I wave func-
tion for A = 0 and A = 8 cm−1, respectively. The same
curves are presented in ﬁgures 2c and 2d but for a wave
vector equal to K = 0.69. The TVBS-I wave function
is described by open squares whereas the TVBS-II wave
function is represented by open circles. When K = 0, the
spectrum supports a single bound state, namely TVBS-I
(Figs. 1). When A = 0 (Fig. 2a), the TVBS-I wave
function is maximum when m = 0 and slightly decreases

creases. It exhibits oscillations and takes signiﬁcant val-
ues for m = 1 and m = 3 whereas it almost vanishes when
m = 2. When the anharmonicity is set to A = 8 cm−1
(Fig. 2b), the maximum in m = 0 is reinforced whereas
the extension of the wave function has been reduced. In
other words, such a state refers to two vibrons trapped
around the same amide-I vibration. However, whatever
the anharmonicity, the wave function shows a 3D charac-
ter so that the bound state extends over the three spines
of the helix. When K = 0.69, Figs. 1 clearly shows that
the energy spectrum supports both TVBS-I and TVBS-
II. The TVBS-I wave function appears strongly localized
onto m = 0 and exhibits basically the same features as
when K = 0 (Figs. 2c and 2d). By contrast, the TVBS-

II wave function vanishes in m = 0. It is maximum in
m = 3 and decreases as the separating distance between
the two vibrons increases or decreases from m = 3 (Figs.
2c and 2d). Such a state refers to two vibrons trapped
around two nearest neighbor amide-I vibrations in a given
spine. Nevertheless, the TVBS-II wave function shows a
3D character so that the three spines of the helix are
involved in the extension of the bound state.

In Figs. 3, the two-vibron energy spectrum is illus-
trated for T = 310 K and for the same set of parameters
used in Figs. 1. Whatever the anharmonicity, the in-
crease of the temperature strongly modiﬁes the nature
of the TVFS continuum. It appears symmetrically dis-
tributed around 2 ˆω0 with a bandwidth which has been
strongly reduced. It is equal to 33.4 cm−1 when A = 0
(Fig. 3a) whereas it reaches 30.5 cm−1 when A = 8
cm−1 (Fig. 3b). As in Figs. 1, the TVBS-I lies be-
low the continuum over the entire Brillouin zone. How-
ever, its binding energy increases at biological tempera-
ture whereas the corresponding bandwidth decreases. In
the harmonic situation, i.e. A = 0 (Fig. 3a), the TVBS-I
binding energy is equal to 9.7 cm−1 and the bandwidth
is equal to 8.4 cm−1. When the anharmonicity is ﬁxed to
A = 8 cm−1 (Fig. 3b), the binding energy reaches 25.9
cm−1 whereas the bandwidth decreases to 3.6 cm−1. As
shown in Figs. 3, the spectrum displays now two wave
vector windows for the occurrence of the TVBS-II. For
A = 0 (Fig. 3a), a ﬁrst wave vector window appears in
the range K = 0.7 and K = 1.4 and a second window
takes place at the end of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, i.e. for
K > 2.7. As previously, as when the anharmonicity is
increased, the range of these two windows increases (Fig.
3b) so that the TVBS-II band clearly tends to get out of
the continuum.

The corresponding TVBS wave functions are illus-
trated in Figs. 4 for A = 0 (Figs. 4a and 4c) and
A = 8 cm−1 (Fig. 4b and 4d). When K = 0 (Figs. 4a
and 4b), the spectrum supports the TVBS-I band, only.

squares whereas the TVBS-II wave function is represented by

Whatever the anharmonicity, the TVBS-I wave function
is maximum in m = 0 and takes signiﬁcant values for
m = 3, m = 6, m = 9 ... and so on. When the anhar-
monicity increases, the maximum in m = 0 is reinforced
and the extension of the wave function is reduced.
In
other words, at biological temperature, the two vibrons
are conﬁned in a given spine and are trapped around
the same amide-I mode. When K = π/3 (Figs. 4c and
4d), Figs. 3 clearly show that the spectrum supports
both TVBS-I and TVBS-II. The TVBS-I wave function
is strongly localized onto m = 0 and almost vanishes for
the other m values. By contrast, the TVBS-II wave func-
tion is clearly localized onto m = 3 so that it refers to
two vibrons strongly trapped onto two nearest neighbors
amide-I modes belonging to the same spine. Note that

the anharmonicity does not modify signiﬁcantly the na-
ture of the wave function of both TVBS-I and TVBS-II.
Finally, the two-vibron energy spectrum is illustrated
in Figs. 5 for T = 310 K, χ1 = 37.5 pN and χ3 = 75.0 pN
(EB(0) = 20.0 cm−1). In that case, the strong vibron-
phonon coupling is responsible for a drastic decrease of
the TVFS bandwidth. As in Figs. 3, the anharmonic-
ity enhances the decrease of the bandwidth which varies
from 13.3 cm−1 for A = 0 (Fig. 5a) to 11.2 cm−1 for
A = 8 cm−1 (Fig. 5b). As previously, the spectrum ex-
hibits a TVBS-I band located below the continuum. The
anharmonicity reduces the corresponding bandwidth and
yields a strong redshift of the band. However, the main
diﬀerence when compared with the two previous cases is
twofold. First, the dressing eﬀect is strong enough to in-
duce the occurrence of the TVBS-II band over the entire
Brillouin zone, even when A = 0 (Fig. 5a). The an-
harmonicity increases the TVBS-II binding energy and
reduces its bandwidth. Then, a third bound state band,
called TVBS-III, occurs below the TVFS continuum. Al-
though it does not appear clearly on the ﬁgure, this band
lies below the continuum over the entire Brillouin zone.
In a marked contrast with the two previous bound states,
the TVBS-III binding energy decreases as when the an-
harmonicity increases since it varies from 0.08 cm−1 when
A = 0 (Fig. 5a) to 0.076 cm−1 when A = 8 cm−1 (Fig.
5b). By contrast, the TVBS-III bandwidth decreases
with A. It is equal to 5.59 cm−1 when A = 0 (Fig. 5a)
and reaches 4.94 cm−1 when A = 8 cm−1 (Fig. 5b).

In the latter situation corresponding to a strong dress-
ing eﬀect, we have veriﬁed that for both the TVBS-I and
the TVBS-II, the two vibrons are conﬁned in a given
spine. TVBS-I refers to their trapping onto the same
amide-I mode (m = 0) whereas TVBS-II characterizes
their trapping onto two nearest neighbor amide-I modes
(m = 3) located in the same spine (the wave functions
are not drawn). The behavior of the wave function of
the third bound state is illustrated in Figs. 6 for A = 0

IV. DISCUSSION

−

To interpret and discuss the previous results, let us
ﬁrst focus our attention onto the inﬂuence of the nonlin-
ear sources, i.e. the intramolecular anharmonicity and
the strong vibron-phonon coupling. As shown in Figs.
1, 3 and 5, the intramolecular anharmonicity is respon-
sible for a decrease of the TVFS bandwidth, typically of
about a few wave numbers. This feature originates in
the modiﬁcation of the hopping constants due to both
the anharmonicity and the dressing eﬀect.
Indeed, a
TVFS corresponds to two independent vibrons moving
according to the eﬀective hopping constants Jef f (n) =
J1(n)exp[
(1 + 4η)S(n, T )] which diﬀer from the con-
stants involved in the harmonic approximation. Ba-
sically, the intramolecular anharmonicity reinforces the
role played by the coupling constant S(n, T ) which char-
acterizes the dressing eﬀect (S(n, T )
(1 + 4η)S(n, T )).
Therefore, it enhances the dressing eﬀect and favors a
decrease of the eﬀective hopping constants so that an-
harmonic vibrons are more sensitive to the dressing ef-
fect than harmonic vibrons. Note that as when the tem-
perature is increased, the strength of the dressing eﬀect
increases which results in a drastic decrease of the TVFS
bandwidth. As shown in Figs. 1, 3 and 5, the TVBS-I
are located below the TVFS continuum over the entire
Brillouin zone whereas, for TVBS-II, two situations oc-
cur depending on the strength of the vibron-phonon cou-
pling. For a weak coupling, the band disappears inside
the continuum when the wave vector lies outside speciﬁc
windows whereas for a strong coupling, the band is lo-
cated below the continuum over the entire Brillouin zone.
As when increasing the anharmonicity, the TVBS-I band
is redshifted and its bandwidth is strongly reduced. In
the same way, the anharmonicity modiﬁes the nature of
the TVBS-II band. If the band is resonant with the con-
tinuum, the anharmonicity tends to open the wave vec-
tor windows and when the TVBS-II band is not resonant

(Figs. 6a and 6c) and A = 8 cm−1 (Figs. 6b and 6d).
When K = π/4 (Figs. 6a and 6b), the TVBS-III wave
function exhibits non vanishing values for m = 1, 2, 4, 5,
... and so on, with a resulting amplitude which decreases
as m increases. By contrast, when K = π/3 (Figs. 6c
and 6d), the wave function appears strongly localized
onto m = 1, only. These features indicate that TVBS-
III refers to vibrons trapped onto neighboring amide-I
modes belonging to two diﬀerent spines. More precisely,
when the TVBS-III binding energy is rather weak, for in-
stance when K = π/4, the bound state is extended and
the two vibrons are trapped over a large distance but be-
long to two diﬀerent spines. By contrast, the TVBS-III
tends to localized when its binding energy increases so
that it refers to vibrons trapped onto two nearest neigh-
bor amide-I modes belonging to two diﬀerent spines.

≈

with the continuum, the anharmonicity induces a redshift
of the band as well as a decrease of its bandwidth. Note
that these diﬀerent features generalize the work detailed
in Ref. [19] devoted to the two-vibron dynamics in one-
dimensional model of helix. We thus can conclude that
the occurrence of both TVBS-I and TVBS-II originates
in the interplay between the intramolecular anharmonic-
ity A and the site dependent small polaron binding en-
ergy EB(n). More precisely, in a 3D helix, it is straight-
forward to show that the small polaron binding energy
takes signiﬁcant values for n = 0 and n = 3 and satisﬁes
2EB(3) in a perfect agreement with the results
EB(0)
obtained in Ref. [19]. Therefore, A and EB(0) are the key
parameters which favors the occurrence of the TVBS-I
through the terms ˆAb†
nbnbn in Eq.(5) which character-
ize an attractive interaction between two vibrons located
onto the same amide-I mode. By contrast, the occur-
rence of TVBS-II is essentially controlled by the parame-
ter EB(3) which, as shown in Eq.(5), yields an attractive
interaction between two vibrons located onto two near-
est neighbor amide-I modes belonging to the same spine.
To obtain a TVBS-II band below the TVFS continuum
over the entire Brillouin zone, EB(3) must exceed a crit-
ical value typically of about 2Jef f (3). As a consequence,
TVBS-I refers to the trapping of the two vibrons onto
the same amide-I mode whereas TVBS-II characterizes
two vibrons trapped onto two nearest neighbor amide-I
modes located in the same spine.

nb†

However, the main results of the present study con-
cerns the inﬂuence of the temperature on the nature of
the two-vibron states in a real helix.

As detailed in paper I [18], the single-vibron dynamics
in a 3D α-helix is characterized by two kinds of hop-
ping processes. The ﬁrst kind refers to vibrational tran-
sition between diﬀerent spines of hydrogen-bonded pep-
tide units whereas the second kind involves vibron hops
In that context, the nature of
along the same spine.
the vibron dynamics essentially results from the compe-
tition between these two kinds of processes. This previ-
ous study has revealed that several parameters such as
the temperature, the small polaron binding energy and
the helix backbone conformation, allow for a transition
between two regimes. At low temperature the small po-
laron behaves like an undressed vibron so that the 3D
nature of the helix plays a crucial role and the vibron is
delocalized between the diﬀerent spines. Within this un-
dressed limit, vibron transitions between nearest neigh-
bor and third nearest neighbor sites represent the dom-
12.4 cm−1 and
inant hopping mechanism since J(1) =
J(3) = 7.8 cm−1 whereas J(2) = 3.9 cm−1. By contrast,
at biological temperature or strong small polaron bind-
ing energy, the dressing eﬀect strongly reduces the vi-
brational exchanges between diﬀerent spines so that the
polaron tends to propagate along a single spine, only.
Indeed, the dressing for vibrons hops between diﬀerent
spines is more eﬃcient than the dressing which aﬀects
vibron transitions along the same spine so that Jef f (3)
becomes the dominant hopping constant.

The singular behavior of the single vibron dynamics
is responsible for the occurrence of a strong tempera-
ture dependence on the two-vibron states. To illustrate
this feature, let us ﬁrst consider the temperature depen-
dence of the TVFS continuum. Indeed, Figs. 1 clearly
show that at low temperature the continuum exhibits a
large bandwidth characterized by a complicated struc-
ture whereas at biological temperature (Figs. 3 and 5),
it appears symmetrically distributed around the central
frequency 2 ˆω0. In that context, it is straightforward to
show that the continuum is perfectly reproduced from the
knowledge of the single vibron energy spectrum and that
the TVFS bandwidth is twice the single vibron band-
width. Therefore, since single vibron states are delocal-
ized over the three spines at low temperature, the dif-
ferent hopping constants contribute to the bandwidth.
For instance, when T = 5 K, χ1 = 25 pN, χ3 = 50 pN
and A = 8 cm−1, the single vibron bandwidth is about
50 cm−1 and yields a TVFS bandwidth equal to 100.0
cm−1 in a perfect agreement with the results displayed
in Figs. 1. Note that in that case the bandwidth mainly
depends on both Jef f (1) and Jef f (3). By contrast, at bi-
ological temperature, the continuum displayed in Figs. 3
and 5 mainly refers to two independent vibrons conﬁned
in a given spine. When long range hopping constants
are disregarded, the single vibron bandwidth is equal to
4Jef f (3). Therefore, when T = 310 K, χ1 = 25 pN and
χ3 = 50 pN, this value leads to a TVFS bandwidth equal
to 29.12 cm−1 when A = 8 cm−1, in a perfect agree-
ment with the value characterizing the real continuum
(see Figs. 3). Note that the shape of the continuum
results form the unfolding of the two-vibron dispersion
curves of the 1D model since the Brillouin zone of the
helix is three time greater than the Brillouin zone of the
corresponding 1D model. Moreover, long range eﬀects in
the hopping constants, which have been disregarded in
Ref.[19], lead to non vanishing values of the continuum
for both K = π/3 and K = π.

The inﬂuence of the temperature on the two-vibron
bound states is twofold. First, it strongly modiﬁes the
nature of both TVBS-I and TVBS-II. Then, it allows for
the occurrence of a third bound state, i.e. TVBS-III,
which has not been obtained within our previous one-
dimensional model [19].

At low temperature (see Figs. 2), non vanishing inter-
spine hopping constants yield a three dimensional nature
of both TVBS-I and TVBS-II which the wave functions
extend over the three spines of the helix. Although the
two vibrons are trapped close to each other, there are not
conﬁned in the same spine so that the pair is allowed to
explore the entire 3D nature of the helix. By contrast,
at biological temperature, the dressing eﬀect strongly re-
duces the vibrational exchanges between diﬀerent spines
so that only intraspine hopping constants remain. The
pairs are thus conﬁned in a given spine and exhibits the
same features as the bound states described within the
one-dimensional model (see Figs. 4). In a marked con-
trast with the previous situation, the occurrence of the

≈

third bound states is strictly due to the 3D nature of
the helix. More precisely, as shown in Sec. II, this 3D
nature manifests itself by the introduction of a general-
ized site dependent small polaron binding energy EB(n).
Although EB(n) takes signiﬁcant values for n = 0 and
n = 3, it does not strictly vanish for n = 1. Note that
0 for n = 2 and n > 3. As a consequence,
EB(n)
Eq.(5) clearly shows that this non vanishing value con-
tributes to an attractive interaction between two vibrons
located onto two diﬀerent spines. However, the formation
of TVBS-III results from the competition between the
interspine hopping constants, which tends to break the
pair, and the previous attractive interaction which allows
for the trapping of the pair. At low temperature, the in-
terspine hopping constants are strong enough to prevent
the occurrence of the third bound states. By contrast,
at biological temperature, the dressing eﬀect strongly re-
duces the vibrational exchanges between diﬀerent spines
so that the attractive interaction mediated by EB(1) is
suﬃcient to create the trapping of the two vibrons onto
two diﬀerent spines. Note that strictly speaking the key
parameter for the occurrence of the TVBS-III is ˆB(1),
which, in addition to its strong dependence on EB(1),
exhibits a weak contribution B(1) proportional to the
intramolecular anharmonicity (see Eq.(6)). Due to the
sign of the hopping constant J(1), B(1) is negative and
tends to produce a repulsive interaction between the two
vibrons. As a consequence, the binding energy of TVBS-
III slightly decreases with the anharmonicity as shown in
Figs. 5.

At this step,

let us mention that this theoretical
work clearly suggests the occurrence of two-vibron bound
states for the amide-I vibrations in α-helices. In a recent
experiment, P. Hamm and co-workers [21, 22] have per-
formed the infrared pump-probe spectroscopy of the N-H
stretch vibrations in a stable α-helix, the poly-γ-benzyl-
L-glutamate (PBLG). They observed two excited-state
absorption bands which were interpreted in terms of the
occurrence of two kind of two-vibron bound states. In
that context, the knowledge of both the single-vibron
and the two-vibron dynamics allows us to simulate this
pump-probe spectrum but for amide-I vibrations. Dur-
ing a pump-probe experiment, the helix interacts with
two infrared short pulses, i.e. the pump and the probe
pulse [21, 22, 30, 31, 33, 34]. The pump pulse excites
the helix from its vibrational ground state to the ﬁrst ex-
cited state. In other words, the pump creates a zero wave
vector single vibron state. By contrast, the probe pulse
measures the change of absorption as a result of that exci-
tation. As a consequence, the pump-probe spectrum ex-
hibits three contributions. The ﬁrst contribution, called
the Bleach, corresponds to the loss of absorption due to
the depletion of the ground state whereas the second con-
tribution characterizes the stimulated emission from the
ﬁrst excited state. These two processes lead to a negative
peak in the pump-probe signal. The third contribution,
which accounts for the creation of zero wave vector two-
vibron states from the excited single-vibron state, yields

a positive peak in the spectrum. From the knowledge
of both the single-vibron [18] and two-vibron states, it
is straightforward to calculate the matrix element of the
dipole involved in the three transitions characterizing the
spectrum [33]. To proceed, both the pump and the probe
pulses are assumed to be polarized along the axis of the
helix and an artiﬁcial width of 1 cm−1 has been intro-
duced to plot the spectrum.

Fig. 7a shows the pump-probe bare spectrum at T =
310 K and with the parameter values as in Fig. 3b. The
spectrum, which is centered onto 2 ˆω0, exhibits a single
negative peak located at -7.2 cm−1 and a single positive
peak located at -34.0 cm−1. In agreement with the result
displayed in Fig. 3b, the positive peak is the signature of
the zero wave vector bound state TVBS-I supported by
the helix. Note that the frequency diﬀerence between the
two peaks is about the binding energy of TVBS-I. For
for parameter
a stronger vibron-phonon coupling, i.e.
values as in Fig. 5b, the pump-probe spectrum shows
three peaks. A negative peak is located at -2.7 cm−1
whereas two positive peaks occur at -18.6 cm−1 and -
62.6 cm−1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5b, the two
positive peaks characterize the two bound states TVBS-
I and TVBS-II. The intensity of the peak connected to
TVBS-II is about two times greater than the intensity
of the peak associated to TVBS-I. Note that the binding

energy of TVBS-III is too weak so that the corresponding

≈

As illustrated in Figs. 7, a pump-probe experiment
provides a direct evaluation of the strength of the diﬀer-
ent nonlinear sources favoring the occurrence of bound
states through the measurement of both the number of
positive peaks and the values of the corresponding bind-
ing energy. Nevertheless, let us mention that relaxation
mechanism have been neglected in the present analysis
so that the width of the diﬀerent peaks has been disre-
garded. For amide-I vibration, we expect a competition
between the binding energy of the bound states and the
width of the corresponding peaks which will result in a
diﬃculty to separate the diﬀerent peaks. Note that it
was not the case for N-H modes in PGLB because al-
though the width of the diﬀerent peaks was about 50
cm−1, the binding energies of both TVBS-I and TVBS-II
were about 275 and 120 cm−1, respectively. These large
values originate in the strong anharmonicity of each N-H
stretching mode (A = 60 cm−1) as well as in the strong
vibron-phonon coupling (EB(0)

84 cm−1).

To conclude this discussion, let us address the funda-
mental question of the breather-like behavior of the two-
vibron bound states. Indeed, the formation of discrete
breathers in nonlinear classic lattices has been the sub-
ject of intense theoretical research during the last decade
(for a recent review, see for instance Refs.
[1, 2, 3, 8]).
Discrete breathers, which correspond to highly localized
vibrational excitations in anharmonic lattices, do not re-
quire integrability for their existence and stability. They
are not restricted to one-dimensional lattices and it has
been suggested that they should correspond to quite gen-
eral and robust time periodic solutions. Recently, the
quantum nature of discrete breathers has been investi-
gated and it has been suggested that bound states involv-
ing several quanta are good candidates for the quantum
counterpart of discrete breathers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 35, 36].
To illustrate the concept of quantum breather in α-
helices, we restrict our attention to TVBS-I which are
located below the TVFS continuum over the entire ﬁrst
Brillouin zone. As shown previously, these states cor-
respond to the trapping of two vibrons onto the same
amide-I mode and described two quanta which behave as
a single particle. Note that, at this step, the breather-like
behavior manifests itself in the localization of the sepa-
rating distance between the two vibrons which form the
pair. To characterize the motion of the pair, we use the
procedure introduced by Proville [36] which consists in
deﬁning the time dependent Wannier wave function as

φn(t) =

When λ is restricted to the TVBS-I band, φn(t) can
be viewed as the wave function associated to the two
trapped vibrons viewed as a single particle. To charac-
terize the motion of that particle, we introduce a coher-
ent lifetime, proportional to the invert of the TVBS-I
bandwidth, which measures the time spent by the pair

on a given site. A zero bandwidth produces an inﬁnite
coherent lifetime for the pair which exhibits a breather-
like behavior, i.e. the two vibrons are trapped around
the site where the pair has been created. By contrast,
a ﬁnite bandwidth leads to the delocalization of the pair
which moves along the lattice.

the site n at time t. The three situations correspond-
ing to the parameters used in Fig. 1b, 3b and 5b are
illustrated in Fig. 8a, 8b and 8c, respectively. At low
temperature, Fig. 8a clearly shows the 3D nature of the
TVBS-I since the pair tends to rapidly delocalize over the
three spines of the helix. Indeed, after a coherent lifetime

|

of about 1.5 ps, 80 % of the initial population have left
the excited site n = 0 and have been tranfered to sites
belonging to the other spines. Note that the population
of the excited site shows damped oscillations due to the
strong anistropy which discrimites between inter and in-
tra spine vibrational exchanges. When the temperature
reaches T = 310 K, the conﬁnement of the pair takes
place as illustrated in Fig. 8b so that the pair propagates
along the spine where it has been created. Nevertheless,
the ﬁnite value of the TVBS-I bandwidth prevents the
localization of the pair which leaves the excited site af-
ter a coherent lifetime of about 7.8 ps. However, for a
stronger vibron-phonon coupling, the TVBS-I bandwidth
is drastically reduced so that the breather-like behavior
of the pair manifests itself by an enhancement of its local
character (Fig. 8c). As previously, the pair is conﬁned
in the spine where it has been created but its coherent
lifetime has been drastically increases and is about 86 ps.

V. CONCLUSION

In the present paper, the two-vibron dynamics associ-
ated to amide-I modes in an α-helix has been described.
The 3D nature of the helix was modeled by three spines
of hydrogen-bonded peptide units linked via covalent
bonds. To remove the intramolecular anharmonicity of
each amide-I mode and to renormalize the strong cou-
pling between the vibrons and the phonons associated to
the external motion of the residues, two unitary transfor-
mations have been applied to ﬁnally obtain the dressed
anharmonic vibrons point of view.
In a perfect agree-
ment with recent calculations performed within a one-
dimensional model of helix, it has been shown that the
two-vibron energy spectrum supports both a TVFS con-
tinuum and two kinds of bound states, called TVBS-I
and TVBS-II, connected to the trapping of two vibrons
onto the same amide-I mode and onto two nearest neigh-
bor amide-I modes belonging to the same spine, respec-
tively. In addition, it has been shown that the interplay

11

between the temperature and the 3D nature of the he-
lix strongly aﬀects the characteristics of the two-vibron
states. This feature originates in the singular behavior
of the single vibron dynamics which displays a transition
between two regimes. At low temperature, the single
polaron behaves as an undressed vibron delocalized be-
tween the diﬀerent spines whereas at biological tempera-
ture, the dressing eﬀect strongly reduces the vibrational
exchanges between diﬀerent spines so that the polaron is
conﬁned in a single spine. The consequence is twofold.
First, the nature of both TVBS-I and TVBS-II is strongly
modiﬁed. Then, a third bound state called TVBS-III oc-
curs. At low temperature, non vanishing interspine hop-
ping constants yield a three dimensional nature of both
TVBS-I and TVBS-II which the wave functions extend
over the three spines of the helix whereas, at biologi-
cal temperature, the pairs are conﬁned in a given spine
and exhibits the same features as the bound states de-
scribed within a 1D model. The occurrence of the TVBS-
III results from the competition between the interspine
hopping constants and the site dependent small polaron
binding energy which favors an attractive interaction be-
tween vibrons located onto diﬀerent spines.
If at low
temperature the hopping constants are strong enough to
prevent the occurrence of TVBS-III, it is no longer the
case at biological. As a result the attractive interaction
becomes the dominant mechanism leading to the trap-
ping of the two vibrons onto two diﬀerent spines. Fi-
nally, the breather-like nature of the TVBS-I has been
analyzed by studying the time evolution of a vibron pair
initially created on a given site. Due to the 3D nature of
TVBS-I, the pair rapidly delocalizes over the three spines
at low temperature which results in a coherent lifetime
of about a few picoseconds. By contrast, at biological
temperature, the pair is conﬁned in the spine where it
has been created. Its coherent lifetime increases with the
strength of the vibron-phonon coupling and it has been
shown that a strong coupling can localize the pair during
a time of about 86 ps.

Binding Eﬀects in Multivalent Gibbs-Donnan Equilibrium

M. Castelnovo∗ and A. Evilevitch†

The classical Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium describes excess osmotic pressure associated with conﬁned
colloidal charges embedded in an electrolyte solution.
In this work, we extend this approach to
describe the inﬂuence of multivalent ion binding on the equilibrium force acting on a charged rod
translocating between two compartments, thereby mimicking ionic eﬀects on force balance during
in vitro DNA ejection from bacteriophage. The subtle interplay between Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium
and adsorption equilibrium leads to a non-monotonic variation of the ejection force as multivalent
salt concentration is increased, in qualitative agreement with experimental observations.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The classical Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium is usually invoked to explain various behaviors in ionic systems: swelling
of polyelectrolyte gels, membrane potentials and osmotic shock experiments of cells or viruses [1]. The physics behind
these phenomena is associated with some colloidal charge (usually synthetic or bio-polyelectrolytes) conﬁned within
a subpart of the system, while small co- and counter-ions can diﬀuse freely in and out of this region [2]. Due to the
electroneutrality inside the compartment, this conﬁnement leads to some excess of counterions relative to the outer
compartment, and therefore an additional osmotic pressure is set up inside. This eﬀect is nowadays well-known and
characterized experimentally on model systems [3].

From a theoretical point of view, the Gibbs-Donnan approach is a simple and versatile way of incorporating
electrostatic eﬀects up to leading order in inhomogeneous systems, through the use of ionic chemical potential balance
between two homogeneous phases and the electroneutrality condition.
In systems either where colloidal charge is
large or where the buﬀer solution contains multivalent ions, the Gibbs-Donnan theory has to be extended to take into
account the electrostatic binding of counterions onto the colloidal charge [4]. Motivated by recent in vitro experiments
measuring multivalent salt inﬂuence on the force ejecting DNA from bacteriophage Lambda [5], we propose in this
Letter such an extension in order to include multivalent ion binding eﬀects in the classical Gibbs-Donnan approach.
Indeed, we expect the interplay between Z-valent ion partitioning between inside and outside the viral capsid (pure
Donnan eﬀect), and the binding statistics onto DNA inside and outside (pure Langmuir-like adsorption statistics),
to give raise to non-trivial translocation behaviors. In a slightly diﬀerent context for example, the balance of these
two eﬀects has been shown by Klein Wolterink et al. to produce non-monotonic variation of the radius of gyration
of a strongly charged polyelectrolyte star with respect to salt concentration [6]. As will be shown in this work, this
simple generalization of Gibbs-Donnan approach is able to explain at least qualitatively the non-monotonicity of
ejecting force as function of multivalent salt concentration. In particular, we ﬁnd that the repulsive force decreases
and then increases, upon increase in the added salt concentration. The minimum in the force is associated to the
charge neutralization point of DNA, which correlates well with experimental results [5].

II. MODEL

The model system considered in this work is depicted in ﬁgure 1. It consists of a cavity of volume V0 embedded into
a larger volume V >> V0. The whole volume V is ﬁlled with a (Z:1) electrolyte at an adjustable concentration. The
cavity is permeable to both species (Z-valent cations and monovalent anions) of the electrolyte. A translocation gate
on the cavity allows a rigid rod bearing L uniformly distributed negative charges to move between inside and outside
the cavity. For a given conﬁguration, there are Lin and L − Lin negative charges respectively inside and outside the
cavity. Multivalent cations are expected to bind onto the charged rod, due to strong electrostatic interactions. The
free energy of this system is written as Ftot = Flayers + Ff ree + Fneutral where the ﬁrst term is associated with the

Z-cation adsorbed layers on the rod, the second term is associated to remaining free ions in the solution, and ﬁnally
the last term takes into account any non-ionic eﬀects.
It can include for example the eﬀect of a neutral osmotic
pressure diﬀerence between inside and outside the cavity due to neutral polymers that cannot enter the cavity, as
in the experimental setup used by Evilevitch et al.
[5, 9], or bending eﬀects in the case where the rod has a ﬁnite
bending modulus [10, 11, 12].

Following the spirit of the original Gibbs-Donnan approach, the speciﬁc features of electrostatic binding are ne-
glected, and the binding of Z-valent cations onto the rod is approximated by Langmuir-like adsorption isotherms [2].
Each negative charge of the rod is therefore assumed to be a potential discrete binding site for a single Z-valent cation.
The energy gain associated with a single binding event is given by −kT ǫA. This energy is of order ǫA ≃ ZlB/b, where
b is the typical size of rod unit and lB the Bjerrum length. This neglects any correlation eﬀects among adsorbed Z-
valent ions. It can be checked a posteriori that including a certain level of correlations does not change the qualitative
picture drawn by this simple model. Denoting by NAin and NAout respectively the number of adsorbed ions on the rod
inside and outside the cavity, the free energy of the adsorbed layers is Flayers = FA(NAin, Lin) + FA(NAout, L − Lin),
where the adsorption free energy of ions on a one dimensional lattice reads

The ﬁrst two terms describe the mixing entropy of adsorbed ions, and the last one is the adsorption energy. Assuming
a unique value b3 for the molar volume of each species (Z-cations, anions, and negative charges on the rod) for the sake
of simplicity, the free energy of remaining free ions in the solution is given by the sum of translational free energies
FT (N, V ) = kT N (ln(N b3/V ) − 1) of Z-cations and anions, respectively, inside and outside the cavity:

Ff ree =

FT (NZin − NAin, V0 − b3Lin) + FT (ZNZin − Lin, V0 − b3Lin)

+FT (Z(NZ − NZin) − (L − Lin), V − V0 − b3(L − Lin))

(cid:27)

Note that the number of Z-cations inside the cavity is NZin, including both free and adsorbed ions, while the total
number of Z-cations in the solution (both inside and outside the cavity, free and adsorbed) is NZ. Following Donnan,
electroneutrality conditions have been taken into account inside and outside the cavity, so that the numbers of inner
and outer anions are N−in = ZNZin − Lin and N−out = Z(NZ − NZin) − (L − Lin).

At equilibrium, the free energy of the system is minimum with respect to NAin, NAout, NZin and Lin. The ﬁrst three
minimization conditions mean simply that the adsorbed layers are in equilibrium with the free Z-ions of the solution,
both inside and outside the cavity (Langmuir balance), and that free Z-ions inside the cavity are in equilibrium with
free Z-ions outside the cavity (Gibbs-Donnan balance). These equations are written in the limit V >> V0, introducing

For a given value of lin, these equations are solved self-consistently and their solutions allow calculation of properties of
interest for the translocation problem, like the ionic contribution to the force acting on the rod fionic = ∂(Flayers+Ff ree)
.
Under equilibrium conditions, the value of lin is set by minimization of the free energy with respect to Lin. Introducing
the force contribution associated with non-ionic features fneutral = ∂Fneutral
, this equation is simply the force balance
∂Linb
on the rod fneutral + fionic = 0. In this Letter, we focus on the behavior of the ionic force for diﬀerent solution
conditions at ﬁxed lin, rather than determining the equilibrium partition of the rod inside and outside the capsid.
Indeed, the value of lin is dependent on the choice of neutral force contribution fneutral, which is beyond the scope of
this work [5].

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In the absence of any analytical solutions for the equilibrium equations 3-5, we solved them numerically for a given
representative set of parameters. As it is seen in ﬁgure 2, the ionic force is always positive and increasing with respect
to the rod length inside the cavity. This has to be contrasted with the net attractive force found in the work of
Zandi et al.
[8], where the binding particles are only present inside the cavity and are not allowed to bind on the
outer part of the rod. Now, increasing multivalent salt concentration leads to a non-monotonic variation of the force
at ﬁxed inner length in the present model, which is the main result of this work: the force is ﬁrst decreasing at low
salt concentration, and then increasing at higher salt concentration. The multivalent salt threshold corresponds to
the neutralization point of the rod φin,out ∼ 1/Z, as it is seen on ﬁgure 3. This behavior is interpreted below by the
interplay between Gibbs-Donnan and Langmuir contribution to the ionic force.

The ionic force is rewritten as the sum of three main contributions fionic = fGD + fL + f∆Π. The three terms are
respectively associated with the Gibbs-Donnan force contribution, the Langmuir force contribution and the osmotic

The ﬁrst contribution Eq. 6 is associated with the free ions partitioning between inside and outside the cavity. In
the absence of ion binding on the rod, there is a depletion of anions and an excess of Z-cations inside the cavity, due
to the negative charge of the rod. Within classical Gibbs-Donnan approach, the net force is repulsive. The eﬀect of
ion binding on the rod at low multivalent ion concentration is mainly to reduce the net negative charge of the rod,
Z, for which φout ∼ 1/Z,
without aﬀecting the sign of the force. Above the neutralization threshold concentration n∗
the net charge of the rod is positive, due to the binding of Z-cations. In this case, there is a depletion of free Z-
cations and an excess of anions inside the cavity. However, in contrast to the previous case, there is still an overall
excess of Z-cations inside (ﬁg. 3), a growing number of them being involved in the binding on the rod leading to its
overcharging. The important proportion of adsorbed Z cations, not contributing to translational entropy inside the
cavity, is now favorable to the rod being inside the cavity. As a consequence, the Gibbs-Donnan force is attractive as
shown in ﬁgure 2. This interpretation does not take into account the free energy of adsorbed layers, however, which
compensates this negative Gibbs-Donnan force to give a net repulsive force.

Indeed the second contribution, Eq. 7, comes from the mixing entropy of adsorbed ions along the rod. The
sign of the force is mainly given by the relative value of inner and outer adsorption degrees φin and φout. At low
multivalent concentration, Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium favors free Z-cations excess inside, thereby increasing inner
adsorption relative to the outside environment. Therefore the Langmuir force tends to pull the rod inside. This is
the quasistatic eﬀect seen in simulations of reference [8] for particular conditions, though with a larger amplitude,
due to the asymetrical binding on the rod. Above the neutralization threshold, the situation is reversed, and outer
adsorption is favored φout > φin (ﬁg. 3). As a consequence, Langmuir force is now repulsive, favoring rod ejection
from the cavity.

The last contribution Eq. 8 in the ionic force is the osmotic force, ﬁrst introduced in [13], and it is proportional to
the osmotic pressure diﬀerence between inside and outside the cavity. It arises from the fact that, in order to insert
the rod which has a ﬁnite volume inside the cavity, one has to perform a pressure work. Within the conditions chosen
in this work, this osmotic force is one order of magnitude smaller than Gibbs-Donnan and Langmuir forces, and is
therefore disregarded in the present analysis.

For the chosen values of parameters (rod length, adsorption energy, etc...), the magnitude of the ionic force is of
order of a few tenths of a piconewton, which is quite small at the molecular level. This comes mainly from the fact that
the net entropic forces discussed previously arise from ionic concentration gradients between two compartments and
two parts of the rod, unlike asymetrical situations where binding is limited to the inner part of the rod for example.
Increasing the length and adsorption energy at ﬁxed V0 produces larger ionic force amplitudes. Added to the neutral
force contribution, the ionic force can still lead to substantial changing of behaviors, as is discussed below.

IV. APPLICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS

As already mentioned in the introduction of this Letter, the present model was originally designed in order to
evaluate the leading order of multivalent ionic eﬀects on in vitro DNA ejection from bacteriophage [5]. Within these
experiments, DNA ejection is triggered using solubilized speciﬁc receptor in a solution containing neutral polymers
producing an osmotic force that is able to balance the DNA ejection force. Changing ionic conditions of the solution
at constant polymer concentration allows us to address the inﬂuence of ionic environment on the ejection force. The
present model is of course a crude simpliﬁcation of the real system. However it is able to predict qualitatively the
non-monotonicity of ejection force, as it is observed in the relevant experiments. Within this model, the minimum in
the force is associated to the neutralization of charged rod φ ∼ 1/Z. Using Eq. 4, the Z-valent threshold concentration
scales like nZ ∼ e−ǫA. This implies that this threshold concentration decreases with the valency of counterions, a fact
that is observed experimentally for three diﬀerent valencies: N a (Z = 1), M g (Z = 2), spermine (Z = 4). Quantitative
comparison of predicted and measured threshold is however diﬃcult since the experimental buﬀer contains more than
one multivalent salt. Our model can easily be extended to include more salt types and their binding competition with
diﬀerent energies ǫA i (i = 1, 2...). This modiﬁed model leads qualitatively to the same results as the one derived for
one multivalent salt (data not shown). The quantitative diﬀerence between the two models is the precise location of

ionic force minimum or neutralization threshold. Since the main eﬀect is already observed within the present simple
one-salt model, we prefer to stick to this model, for the sake of clarity. Note that Gibbs-Donnan balance has already
been used by Odijk and co-workers in order to describe DNA packing in a model-bacteriophage [14]. But the presence
of multivalent ions as well as their inﬂuence on DNA ejection has been disregarded.

The main eﬀect that is not included explicitly within this model is the presence of correlations between bound ions,
changing the eﬀective adsorption energy [15]. However, we don’t expect this eﬀect to change drastically the results
derived within our model: indeed, the non-monotonicity of the ionic force is related within our model to the presence
of neutralization of the rod and possible overcharging, and not to its precise description. We checked with non-linear
adsorption energy that prohibits the rod from being unrealistically too overcharged, that the qualitative behavior is
unchanged. In particular, we observed that including only correlations and neglecting Gibbs-Donnan balance does
not lead to non-monotonicity of ionic force, so that the experimentally observed minimum of the force can not be
explained solely by invoking correlation eﬀects. Therefore both basic ingredients of our model, Gibbs-Donnan balance
and adsorption statistics, are necessary to observe the non-monotonicity of the force. Notice that for similar reasons
we don’t expect correlations of free ions, like the leading order Debye-Huckel correlations [1], to change qualitatively
the results obtained in this Letter.

In order to interpret the results of DNA ejection experiments within this model, an additional implicit assumption
has been made: the ionic eﬀects can be decoupled from other contributions, termed “neutral” within this work. This
assumption is valid within the simple geometry shown in ﬁgure 1. In a more realistic model of viral bacteriophage,
where DNA is arranged in a spool-like fashion within the viral cavity, the neutral contribution would include bending
energy as well as direct electrostatic repulsion between neighbouring DNA turns in the spool [10, 11, 12]. Up to now
except in aforementioned works of Odijk and co-workers [14], the inclusion of electrostatic eﬀects in such models has
been based on phenomenological expressions describing osmotic pressure of hexagonal phases of DNA as measured in
the experiments of [16] for example. Since the simple extended Gibbs-Donnan model presented here is qualitatively
consistent with these expressions[17], we expect our model to describe correctly the leading order of multivalent ionic
eﬀects.

The range of application of the simple model proposed in this Letter is larger than the ejection experiment just
mentioned. Indeed it is relevant to the description of translocation properties of polyelectrolytes[7], whenever the
separating interface is permeable to mobile free ions. We showed in this paper that the force balance acting on

the rod can be displaced by changing ionic conditions. Within a biological context, the applicability of the present
model for the translocation of bio-polyelectrolytes between diﬀerent cell compartments, for example, is limited by the
presence of ionic channels on the interface (cell compartment membrane) that actively regulate the ionic gradients
accross the interface. Therefore the pure Gibbs-Donnan balance is no longer obtained, and new models have to be
developed.

DNA migration in topologically structured microchannels with periodical cavities is investigated
experimentally and with Brownian dynamics simulations of a simple bead-spring model. The results
are in very good agreement. In particular, the experimentally observed migration order of λ- and
T 2-DNA molecules is reproduced by the simulations. The simulation data indicate that the mobility
may depend on the chain length in a nonmonotonic way at high electric ﬁelds. This is found to
be the signature of a nonequilibrium phase transition between two diﬀerent migration states, which
can also be observed experimentally under appropriate conditions.

I.

INTRODUCTION

DNA electrophoresis is one of the main techniques to
separate DNA molecules by size1. Since the mobility
of DNA molecules does not depend on the chain length
in free solution, it is usually performed in gels. Due to
the progress of microtechnology, much eﬀort has been
spent on the integration of DNA electrophoresis into
microﬂuidic devices2. However, the separation of long
DNA molecules (> 20 kbp) in microﬂuidic channels with
standard separation techniques remains a diﬃcult task,
mainly due to technical problems with the incorporation
of cross-linked gels or high-viscosity polymer solutions.

Hence, separation strategies which rely on well-deﬁned
microscopic structures have been explored. Various such
devices have been proposed. Two particularly promising
new separation techniques and combinations thereof are
currently under investigation. On the one hand, DNA
separation can be achieved in geometrically structured
microﬂuidic devices3,4,5,6,7,8,9. The mobility of the DNA
in these microstructures is determined by a subtle inter-
play of the characteristic dimensions of the microstruc-
ture and the molecular size. Another interesting ap-
proach to separating long DNA strands by length are
ratchets. These exploit the size-dependent diﬀusion con-
stant of DNA and use a periodically changing asymmetric
electrical ﬁeld10,11,12,13 for DNA separation. An overview
is given in Ref. 14.

In the present work, we focus on a geometry which has
been investigated by Han and Craighead et al.6,15,16 and
later by us (Duong et al.9). The DNA is pulled through
a periodic sequence of wide cavities and narrow constric-
tions (see Figs. 1 and 2) with an electrical DC ﬁeld. In
the original channels of Han and Craighead, the thickness
of the narrow regions is of the order of 0.1µm, which cor-
responds to a few persistence lengths of DNA molecules
(entropic traps). In these structures, Han and Craighead
observed that long DNA molecules migrate faster than
short DNA molecules. They rationalized their ﬁnding in
terms of a simple model: The DNA gets trapped at the
entrance of the narrow constrictions and escapes through
a thermally activated process, which is initiated by the

formation of a loop that stretches into the constriction.
The escape rate depends on the amount of polymer in
contact with the constriction and increases with the chain
size.

The experiments of Han and Craighead motivated sev-
eral computer simulation studies17,18,19, which repro-
duced the results and lead to an improved understand-
ing of the DNA separation mechanisms in these channels.
In particular, some of us19 have recently used Brownian
dynamics simulations to uncover an additional separa-
tion mechanism that had not been noticed previously,
and that actually dominates over the separation mech-
anism suggested by Han and Craighead: While travel-
ing through the wide cavities, DNA molecules may get
sidetracked and diﬀuse into the corner of the cavity.
Here, the electrical ﬁeld is low, and the remaining net
force acting on the molecule presses it towards the wall
rather than towards the entrance of the constriction (see
Fig. 1). The chains may therefore remain trapped for a
long time. While the escape rate from the corner depends
only weakly on the chain length, the probability of get-
ting trapped increases with increasing diﬀusion constant
and is thus higher for shorter chains. As a result, long
chains travel, on average, faster than short chains.

deed, we have recently reported the observation of size-
dependent electrophoresis in structured microchannels
with constrictions widths of 1.5 and 3 µm (see Fig. 2),
which corresponded roughly to the radius of gyration of
the tested DNA molecules: The mobility of λ-DNA (48
kbp) in these channels diﬀered signiﬁcantly from that
of T 2-DNA (164 kbp) (Duong et al.9). Unexpectedly,
however, the relation between mobility and chain length
turned out to be inverse to that observed earlier: The
short λ-DNA migrated faster than the longer T 2-DNA!
In the present paper, we explore the reasons for this
unforeseen behavior by Brownian dynamics simulations
of a simple bead-spring model. Models of this kind have
been used successfully in the past to study the migration
of DNA in various geometries19,20,21,22,23. Our simula-
tions reveal a surprisingly complex phenomenology.
If
the model parameters are adjusted to the experiment, we
reproduce the experimental ﬁndings. With other model
parameters (smaller structures, lower electrical ﬁeld), we
recover the originally expected increase of mobility with
increasing chain length. The reversal of this trend turns
out to be the signature of a nonequilibrium ﬁrst order
phase transition, which emerges at even higher ﬁelds or
in even larger structures.

In order to test this theoretical prediction, we have

2

carried out additional experiments. Under appropriate
experimental conditions, we indeed observed two diﬀer-
ent migration modes. Thus the experiments conﬁrm the
theoretical results.

The paper is organized as follows: The simulation
model and the simulation technique are described in
Sec. II, and the experimental setup in Sec. III. In Sec. IV,
we brieﬂy discuss the simulations corresponding to the
earlier experimental study by Duong et al.9. The re-
sults on the two coexisting migration states are presented
in Sec. V, and the possible transition mechanisms are
discussed in Sec. VI. We summarize and conclude in
Sec. VII.

II. THE SIMULATION MODEL

A. Deﬁnition of the model

We describe the DNA on a coarse-grained level by a
bead-spring model. Several base pairs of DNA are rep-
resented by one bead or “monomer”. Neighboring beads
are connected by harmonic springs

Vsp(r) =

r2,

k

(1)

where r is the distance between the two neighboring
monomers. All beads interact with a purely repulsive

(2)
where σ ≡ 1 represents the range and r the distance
between two monomers.

The walls are assumed to be soft, but purely repulsive.
The potential describing the interaction with the walls is
the same as that acting between the monomers (Eq. (2), r
here being the minimum distance between a bead and the
wall). Therefore, each wall is eﬀectively surrounded by a
repulsive layer with a thickness of roughly 1σ. As the size
of the structures is quite large (60σ, see Sec. II B), the
eﬀect of this layer should be negligible. In the corners,
the forces of the adjacent walls are summed up to ensure
smooth transitions.

Each bead carries a charge q and is subject to an elec-
trical force ~fel = q ~E, which is caused by a spatially vary-
ing external electrical ﬁeld ~E. Charges do not interact
with one another. The ﬁeld is calculated by solving the
Poisson-Boltzmann equation in the channel with the as-
sumption that the solvent represents a conductor and
that the walls are insulators. Thus the boundary con-
dition demands that the component of the ﬁeld perpen-
dicular to the wall vanishes (Eq. (3)), because it would
be compensated by the mobile ions in the solvent other-
wise. Furthermore, the charge density inside the chan-
nel is zero, Eq. (4), and a constant potential diﬀerence

between the two entrances of the channels is enforced
(Eq. (5)). Together, one obtains:

∂Φ/∂~n =
△Φ =

0
0

(3)
(4)
Φ = const. at the entrances of the channel (5)

at the walls
inside the channel

We note that the electrical ﬁeld is not homogeneous.
The ﬁeld lines are shown in Fig. 2. Throughout the rest of
this paper, ﬁeld values E will refer to the total potential
diﬀerence divided by the total channel length, and can
thus be regarded as some kind of average electrical ﬁeld.
The motion of the chain is described by Langevin dy-
namics, i. e., the solvent surrounding the chains is re-
placed by a Brownian force ~ηi and a friction ζ ≡ 1. The
random noise η fulﬁlls24

with monomer indices i, j = 1 . . . N and cartesian direc-
tions {α, β} = {x, y, z}. The equations of motion thus
become

˙~ri = ~vi

m ˙~vi = ~fi − ζ~vi + ~ηi,

(8)

(9)

where {~ri} and {~vi} represent the locations and the veloc-
ities of the monomers, respectively. The vectors { ~fi} sum
over all forces acting on a monomer (harmonic spring, re-
pulsive monomer interaction, wall interaction, electrical
ﬁeld). Each bead carries the mass m. In special cases,
simulations with vanishing mass were also carried out for
comparison (see Sec. VI). The equations of motion then
become

ζ ˙~ri = ~fi + ~ηi.

(10)

The natural units of our simulation are deﬁned in
terms of the bead size σ, the friction coeﬃcient ζ, the
bead charge |q|, and the temperature T . Based on these
quantities, our energy unit is kBT , the length unit is σ,
the time unit is t0 = ζσ2/kBT (obtained via a dimen-
sional analysis), and the unit for the electrical ﬁeld is
E0 = kBT /σ|q|.

The dynamical equations (8) and (9) are integrated
with a Verlet algorithm using a timestep ∆t = 10−2t0.
In the case of the relaxational dynamics Eq. (10), we use
an Euler algorithm with the time step ∆t = 10−4t0. The
stochastic noise ~ηi was realized by picking random num-
bers at every time step. As has been shown in Ref. 25, the
random numbers do not have to be Gaussian distributed,
as long as they fulﬁll the Eqns. (6) and (7). Those used
in our simulation were evenly distributed inside the unit
sphere. Unless stated otherwise, the run lengths were
4 − 20 · 108∆t with equilibration times of 2 · 107∆t.

In order to avoid chain crossing, the spring constant
in Eq. (1) was chosen very high, k = 100kBT /σ2. The

equilibrium length of each bond is 0.847σ. The minimum
energy barrier that two chains must overcome in order to
cross each other is Ecross = 81kBT , and the correspond-
ing crossing radius is rcross = 1.198σ. Fig. 3 shows the
distribution of bond lengths obtained from a simulation
of a freely diﬀusing chain with N = 1000 monomers. It
basically follows the Boltzmann factor for the potential
Vpair + Vsp. We have examined the tail of the distribu-
tion and found that only a fraction of less than 0.2 · 10−4
of all bonds were larger than r = 1σ, and none larger
than r = 1.1σ. As chain crossing involves stretching
of two bonds and overcoming an extra energy barrier of
19.5kBT , we are certain that it never occurred in our
simulations.

The static properties of free chains of length N cor-
respond to those of self-avoiding random walks with the
persistence length lp = 1.6σ and the radius of gyration26
Rg = 0.5σ · N ν . Here ν = 0.588 is the Flory expo-
nent. The dynamical properties are characterized by the
diﬀusion constant D = kBT /N ζ = N −1σ2/t0, the mo-
bility µ0 = |q|/ζ = σ/E0t0, which is independent of the
chain length N , and the decay time of the drift veloc-
ity τ0 = m/ζ (eqn. 9). The quantity τ0 sets the time
scale on which inertia eﬀects become important. In most
simulations presented here, it was set to τ0 = 1 t0 (i. e.,
m = 1 ζt0), based on the assumption that the relevant
time scales for the dynamical processes of interest here
are much longer.
In some cases, however, simulations
with vanishing τ0 (vanishing mass) were also necessary
(see Sec. VI). On time scales larger than τ0, the chains
behave like standard (self-avoiding) Rouse chains24 with
the Rouse relaxation time τR ≈ 0.045 t0 · N 1+2ν.

B. Comparison of the model and the experiment

In the experiments, the mobility of λ-DNA (48 kbp)
and T 2-DNA (164 kbp) in microchannels with geometries
such as sketched in Fig. 2 was studied. Details are given
in Ref. 9 and Sec. III. We will now discuss how the

parameters and units of our model can be related to those
of the experiment.

The energy unit is simply given by the temperature,
kBT = 300kBK ≈ 0.026eV , at which the experiments
were carried out. Next we adjust the value of the length
In our earlier work on entropic traps19, we had

matched the persistence lengths of the model chains with
that of DNA. In the present case, however, the per-
sistence length is not an experimentally relevant length
scale, because all dimensions of the microchannels are on
the order of magnitude of the radius of gyration. Thus we
can determine the length unit by comparing the charac-
teristic length H in our model channel (see Fig. 2) to the
corresponding experimental value. Note that this implies
that we can relate simulations with one channel geometry
to all three experimental channels.

More speciﬁcally, the simulations were carried out us-
ing channels with H = 60σ. We illustrate our adaptation
with the example of the 5µm microchannels. It is carried
out in four steps. First, we compare the channel height
H = 5µm ≡ 60σ. This gives the length unit 1σ ≡ 83nm.
Second, comparing the radii of gyration of our model
chains with that of λ-DNA, we ﬁnd that λ-DNA is rep-
resented by chains of N = 140 beads, or 1 bead ≡
340 bp. Third, the time unit is adjusted by matching
the diﬀusion constant for λ-DNA. Experimentally, Smith
et. al. have reported27 D = 0.47 ± 0.03µm2/sec. Com-
paring this with the theoretical value, D = σ2/N t0, we
obtain t0 ≡ 1.1 · 10−4s. Hence, one second corresponds
to 9.5 · 103t0 (or ∼ 106 time steps). Finally, the electrical
ﬁeld unit E0 is adjusted by adjusting the free ﬂow mobil-
ity µ0. The total mobility of DNA in large unstructured
microchannels is chain length independent and given by9
1.84 · 10−4cm2/V s. It is the sum of the free ﬂow mobility
µ0 and the electroosmotic mobility (see below), which re-
sulted in (2.9 ± 0.6) · 10−4cm2/V s determined by the cur-
rent monitoring method in our channels. Thus the free
ﬂow mobility is roughly µ0 ≈ 4.7 · 10−4cm2/V s, leading
to 1V /cm ≡ 0.0060E0.

These values as well as those obtained for channels
with H = 3µm and H = 1.5µm are summarized in table
I. Unless stated otherwise, all adaptations given in this
paper except in Sec. IV, refer to the 5µm channels.

cal eﬀects. First, electrostatic interactions are neglected.
The Debye screening length of DNA in typical buﬀer solu-
tions is about 2nm, which is comparable to the diameter
of the polymer and much smaller than the persistence
length of DNA (roughly 50nm).

Second, PDMS exhibits silanol groups on its sur-
face which dissociate under the experimental conditions.
Thus the experiments were carried out in microchannels
with negatively charged surfaces. This implies the gen-
eration of cathodic electroosmotic ﬂow, and the resulting
mobility of DNA molecules is a sum of the electroosmotic
and electrophoretic mobilities. The DNA molecules mi-
grate to the anode, indicating that electrophoresis over-
comes electroosmosis. In the simulation, we do not in-
corporate any electroosmotic ﬂow, or ﬂow in general.

Third, hydrodynamic eﬀects are not taken into ac-
count. This approximation must be questioned. On
the one hand, DNA is always surrounded by counter
ions, which are dragged into the opposite direction of
the DNA. Thus the DNA molecule experiences not only
hydrodynamic drag, but also an extra friction from the
solvent molecules. In free solution, these two eﬀects can-
cel each other1. This “hydrodynamic screening” accounts
for the (unfortunate) experimental observation that the
mobility of free DNA is independent of the chain length.
However, the total cancellation fails if the DNA molecule
is blocked by a geometric barrier28.
In that case, the
counter ions will not be immobilized, because they are
much smaller. Furthermore, hydrodynamic interactions
aﬀect the diﬀusion constant D. In our model, it scales the
chain length N like a Rouse chain (D ∝ 1/N ). Includ-
ing hydrodynamic interactions, one would expect Zimm
scaling D ∝ 1/Rg ∝ 1/N ν. In experiments, the diﬀusion
constant of DNA is found to scale as29 D ∝ 1/N 0.672.

Unfortunately, a full simulation which treats hydro-
dynamic interactions correctly, takes due account of the
(dynamically varying) counter ion distribution, and in-
cludes electrostatic interactions, is a formidable task and
impossible with standard computer resources. The sim-
pliﬁcations applied here will aﬀect the quantitative re-
sults, but presumably neither by orders of magnitude nor
qualitatively.

Microresist, GER) coated Si-wafer (CrysTec, GER) is
exposed through a chromium mask (DeltaMask, NL).
After developing and hard-baking liquid PDMS (Sylgard
184, Dow Corning, USA) is poured onto the master
containing the inverted microstructure and baked for 3
h at 75◦. Peeling oﬀ the PDMS slab, punching reservoir
holes through the PDMS and covering it with a clean
microscope glass slide results in the microchip. Fig.

2b shows a scanning electron micrograph (SEM) image
of the topview of a microchannel with H=5µm.
In
comparison to the simulated geometry, the corners of
the cavities are rounded and the lengths a, b, c, and d
in Fig. 2b are not exactly equal. The exact values were
a=3, 6µm. , b= 6.0µm. , c=3.7µm and d=4.7µm. The
depth of the microchannel was 2.8µm. Other channel
geometries mentioned in this work are described in detail
in Ref. 9.

For ﬂuoresence imaging, 6 pM λ- or T 2-DNA (Fluka,
Germany) in the same buﬀer (10 mM Tris at pH 8.3 con-
taining 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) and 2% (v/v) β-Mercaptoethanol) were
adjusted to a YOYO-1 (Molecular Probes, USA) to a
basepair ratio of 1 : 7.5. A sensitive ﬂuoresence video-
microscopy setup is used to record DNA migration, as
described in Ref. 9. Brieﬂy, it consists of an inverted
microscope (Axivert 100, Zeiss, GER) with a ﬁlterset
for ﬂuorescence observation (XF100-3, Omega, USA),
a 100x oil immersion objective (Plan Neoﬂuar NA 1.3,
Zeiss, GER) and a sensitive CCD-camera (Imager 3LS,
LaVision, GER). Data acquisition and automated data
analysis is performed in DaVis 5.4.4 (LaVision) using
cross-correlation analysis. Electric ﬁelds are applied with
power supplies from FUG (MCN 14-2000, GER).

The electroosmotic mobility was determined according
to the current monitoring method30. Linear channels of
20 µm width and depth were ﬁlled with water immedi-
ately after assembly, which was exchanged by the 10 mM
sample buﬀer without DNA before the experiment. The
buﬀer in the anode reservoir was then exchanged by 8 mM
Tris buﬀer with otherwise identical composition as the
10 mM buﬀer. A constant electric ﬁeld of 400 V/cm was
applied and the current was recorded until a stable lower
current value was reached. The recorded current decay
times ∆t, were used to calculate the electroosmotic mo-
bility according to: µeof = l
E∆t , with l the length of the
channel, and E the applied electric ﬁeld.

IV. SIMULATION AT LOW ELECTRICAL
FIELD

We begin with presenting simulations for relatively low
electrical ﬁelds E, which can be compared to the previ-
ously published experimental results of Duong et al.9. In
this section, we will adjust our model units to the chan-
nels with characteristic size H = 3µm (cf. Sec. II B),
where Duong et al. had found particular clear evidence
of a size-dependent mobility.

The electrical ﬁeld was varied from E = 0.0025E0 up
to E = 0.04E0, which corresponds to experimental ﬁelds
in the range of 1.6V /cm up to 26V /cm. The chain lengths
range from N = 10 up to N = 2000 monomers, modeling
DNA strands from 1.5 kbp up to 290 kbp.

Fig.

0.005E0. The trajectories are similar to those obtained
for the entropic trap geometry19. For N = 10, the trajec-

The horizontal dashed lines mark the beginning of the narrow

tory is completely dominated by diﬀusion. Long chains
with N = 1000 monomers are hardly aﬀected by the
constrictions – much less, in fact, than in the case of the
entropic traps. This is because the width of the narrow
regions is of the order of the radius of gyration; the chain
is thus able to cross the constriction without uncoiling.
The trapping mechanism suggested by Han et al. (Fig. 1
a)6 should not apply here. The fact that some trapping
nevertheless occurs underlines the importance of the ef-
fect reported by Streek et al. (Fig. 1b)19. Indeed, Fig. 5
shows that the mobility increases as a function of the
chain length for E = 0.005E0.

In the experimental channel, E = 0.005E0 corresponds
to the real ﬁeld E ∼ 3V /cm. In such low ﬁelds, Duong et
al.9 were unable to distinguish between diﬀerent mobili-
ties for diﬀerent DNA sizes. The statistical error is large,
since the drift velocity is superimposed by diﬀusion. We

note that in simulations, we can trace the DNA migra-
tion over many more cavities than in the experiments;
therefore the relative error is smaller.

At higher ﬁelds, Duong et al.9 reported the inverse ef-
fect – the mobility of T 2-DNA is smaller than that of λ-
DNA. If we increase the electrical ﬁeld in the simulations
accordingly, we ﬁnd indeed that the mobility reaches a
maximum at N = 200 beads (29 kbp) and decreases for
longer chains. (Fig. 5). In the parameter region corre-
sponding to λ-DNA and T 2-DNA, smaller chains migrate
faster than longer chains. Thus our simulations repro-
duce the behavior observed by Duong et al.9.

This result is gratifying, but it does not yet explain
why the chain length dependence of the mobility is sud-
denly reversed.
In order to explore this question, we
decided to investigate the migration in our structures
under more extreme conditions. In the simulations, we
can increase the ﬁeld strength E.
In the experiments,
this can only be realized up to a ﬁeld of approximately
100V /cm. At higher ﬁelds, the cross correlation analy-
sis9 fails, because the mean molecule distance is smaller
than the displacement of a molecule during the 40msec
exposure time. However, table I shows that we can alter-
natively work with larger structures. Therefore, we have
fabricated and studied microstructures with H = 5µm.
The results will be presented in the next section.

V. TWO MIGRATION SPEEDS

We begin with discussing the simulation results. We
started with studying the extreme case E = 1E0, which
corresponds to 170 V /cm in a 5µm structure. Two sam-
ple trajectories for a chain of length N = 10 (3.4 kbp)
and N = 400 (140 kbp) monomers are given in Fig. 6.
As can be seen from the insets at N = 10, the chains
retain some memory of their state in the previous cavity.

If a chain passes a constriction without being stopped, it
is very likely that it passes the next barrier in a similar
way. A similar eﬀect had already been observed in the
entropic traps19. As in the simulations discussed in the
previous section, chains may still get trapped in the cor-
ners of cavities, but at a lower rate due to the reduced
diﬀusion time inside a single cavity. For N = 400, the
migration is periodically fast and slow, indicating that
the polymer penetrates the low ﬁeld regions in the cavi-
ties. Both the trajectories for N = 10 and N = 400 are
quite regular.

FIG. 6: Trajectories of a chain with a) N = 10 (3.4 kbp) and
b) N = 400 (140 kbp) monomers at E = 1E0 (170V /cm).
The dashed lines inside the inset at N = 400 represent the
onset of the narrow regions.

The situation is diﬀerent for N = 200 (70 kbp). The
trajectory is smooth on short time scales, but occasion-
ally, the speed of migration changes almost instantly
(Fig. 7). One observes two states of migration, one of
which is fast and the other is slow. The lower pannel
of Fig. 7 shows that the two states are associated with
two distinctly diﬀerent z-positions of the center of mass:
The polymer migrates faster when it stays in the homo-
geneous ﬁeld in the upper part of the channel.

We conclude that our microchannel system exhibits
a nonequilibrium ﬁrst order phase transition between
two diﬀerent migration states. The nonmonotonic chain
length dependence of the mobility at E = 0.04E0 is pre-
sumably a signature of that transition.

The experimental counterpart of this simulation is a
study of λ-DNA and T 2-DNA migration in large struc-
tures characterized by H ≈ 5µm.
In these structures,
at electrical ﬁelds ranging up to 100V /cm, both λ- and
T 2-DNA were found to exhibit two states of migration

with two diﬀerent migration speeds. They are illustrated
by the snapshots shown in Fig. 8. In one state, the chain
remains coiled all the time in the upper (homogeneous)
part of the ﬁeld, and travels at high speed. In the other,
it penetrates deep into each cavity, forms a coil inside,
and gets stretched again when moving into the narrow
region. As is obvious from Fig. 7, both states have a
long life time in the simulations.

Figs. 9 and 10 show monomer density histograms ob-
tained from experiment and simulation. Both in the ex-
periments and in the simulations with chains of length
N = 120 − 250 beads, we observe a low-density depletion
zone between the upper and the lower part of the channel.
Furthermore, Fig. 10 shows that short chains are more
likely to migrate in the fast state and long chains are more
likely to migrate in the slow state. For N = 120 − 250,
the polymer migrates alternatingly in the slow and fast
state, as has already been seen from the trajectory of
N = 200 (ﬁg. 7).

Density histograms such as those shown in Fig. 10 al-
low to determine the population density of the two states.
The z-position of the center of mass turns out to be
a good indicator of a polymer’s state (cf. also Fig. 7).
Since the transition does not take place instantaneously
(Fig. 14), we deﬁne two thresholds separated by a gap:
A chain is taken to be in the slow state or in the fast
state, if z ≤ 8σ or z ≥ 20σ over at least 5 · 106 time
steps. After having assigned a state to large portions of
the trajectory, we can determine the mobility in the slow
and the fast state separately.

Fig. 11 shows the results for E = 1E0 and compares
it with the overall mobility. The assignment of states
works well for intermediate and long chains. For N = 100
(34 kbp), the polymer migrates almost completely in the
fast state and for polymers with N ≥ 320 (110 kbp), the
polymer occupies the slow state only. Short chains diﬀuse

slow state (drawn elongation)
fast state (drawn elongation)

show a time evolution (fast state shown by arrows pointing

shots show chains in the slow state, which penetrate the wide
region, form a coil inside and stretch when passing into the
narrow region. Chains in the fast state are also shown. Here
the polymer remains permanently coiled in the homogeneous
part of the ﬁeld.

very strongly in the z direction, no depletion zone occurs,
and they often cross from the lower to the upper part of
the channel. Therefore, the assignment criterion often
fails, and only a few short fragments of the trajectory
contribute to the calculation of the mobility in the fast
state. This explains why the result does not coincide
with the total mobility at low N .

The transition was not only observed at E = 1 E0,
but also observed at smaller ﬁelds E. Fig. 12 gives the
mobilities and the population densities for E = 0.25 E0
(42V /cm) and E = 0.04 E0 (6.7V /cm), as determined by
the above criterium. At E = 0.25 E0, the transition is
not as pronounced as for E = 1 E0, but still present. At
E = 0.04 E0, the transition has almost disappeared, and
only a slight decrease in the overall mobility remains.

This conﬁrms our earlier assertion that the nonmono-
tonic chain length dependence of the mobility at E =
0.04 E0 is a signature of the phase transition.
It also
clariﬁes why long chains (T 2-DNA) migrate slower than
shorter chains (λ-DNA) in our channels. They tend to
penetrate deeper into the low ﬁeld regions, which slows
them down signiﬁcantly.

– 85 kbp), which is also reﬂected by the population densities
given in the lower panel. For short chains, diﬀusion dominates
the migration, and most of the time, it is not possible to assign
unambiguously a single migration state. This is reﬂected by
the density of “undeﬁned” population.

VI. TRANSITION MECHANISMS

To understand the transition and identify the factors
which stabilize the two migration states, we have investi-
gated the transition processes between the two states in
more detail.

A. Transition from the fast to the slow state

We begin with discussing the transition from the fast
to the slow state. A series of snapshots of a chain with
N = 500 beads in the process of crossing from the fast to
the slow state is shown in Fig. 14. During the transition
process, the chain travels through roughly 35 cavities.

The transition process can be divided into diﬀerent

stages:

1. At the beginning, the polymer is in a coiled confor-
mation in the homogeneous ﬁeld area. The radius
of gyration of a chain of N = 500 beads in free so-
lution is Rg ≈ 18σ. The size of the homogeneous
ﬁeld region is limited, thus larger polymers are de-
formed (Fig. 14 a).

2. At some stage, one polymer loop or end happens
to penetrate into a region with a lower ﬁeld. As
that polymer part experiences a lower drag, it slows
down, while the force acting on the rest of the
polymer is unchanged. This leads to uncoiling and
stretching of the polymer.

3. More and more monomers are slowed down. Since
the ﬁeld in the homogeneous part drags horizon-
tally in x-direction, and the delayed monomers are

FIG. 10: Monomer density histograms obtained from sim-
ulation for N = 50, 100, 120, 140 (top,
left to right) and
N = 170, 200, 250 and 320 (bottom). The density distribu-
tion ρ was cut oﬀ at ρ = 1/2 to dampen the peaks at the
corners of the constrictions and to emphasize the depletion
zone.

experiments raises a question. According to the simu-
lations, coexistence of two states should be observed at
chain lengths below N = 250 beads, which corresponds
to 64 kbp in 5µm microchannels. Thus we would expect
two mobilities for λ-DNA, but only one for T 2-DNA. This
is in obvious contrast to the experimental observation.

However, a closer inspection reveals that even chains of
N = 500 beads (170 kbp, roughly T 2-DNA) remain in a
fast state for a long time, if they are prepared accordingly.
Fig. 13 shows a number of trajectories of chains, which
were initially set up in the upper part of the channel.
These initial fast states turned out to be so stable, that
we were unable to analyze their life time in detail.

The experimental situation hardly corresponds to an
“equilibrated” late-time limit. It is conceivable that after
being introduced into the microﬂuidic channel, a sizable
fraction of molecules happens to be prepared in a state
that is very weakly populated in the long-time average.

located in the cavities at low z values, the chain ex-
periences a net force downward (Fig. 14 b). After a
while, the polymer is completely stretched (Fig. 14
c).

4. For the highly stretched chain, (Fig. 14 c), the prob-
ability that the foremost monomer gets trapped in
a cavity is very high. Immediately afterwards, the
polymer collapses in that cavity. (Fig. 14 d).

5. At the end, the polymer migrates in the slow state.
For long polymers, the probability to leave the slow
state is very low (Fig. 14 d).

been able to distil the mechanisms which stabilize the
fast state in a satisfactory way.

One eﬀect which presumably contributes to the stabi-
lization is caused by the fast variations of the ﬁeld lines
at the corners of the constriction, see Fig. 15. Monomers
migrating at high speed do not follow the electrical ﬁeld
exactly, which leads to a net drift perpendicular to the
ﬁeld lines. This eﬀect is an inertia eﬀect, and involves
dynamical processes on time scales smaller than τ0, the
characteristic decay time for the drift velocity of the poly-
mer.
In our model, τ0 is given by τ0 = m/ζ, which
corresponds to approximately 10−4s for beads of mass
m = 1ζt0. For DNA in free solution, the drift veloc-
ity decay time is31 τ0 ≈ 10−9 . . . 10−12s, which is much
smaller. Thus this particular stabilization mechanism is
an artifact of the simulation model.

Unfortunately, the conﬁguration snapshots of the tran-

by the number of cavities given on the right. The transition
itself takes about 35 cavities. In b) a force parallelogram is
sketched schematically. The electric force Fe and the entropic
spring force Fc on the leading monomers add up to a total net
force which points downwards.

at E = 1E0 and temperature zero (no diﬀusion). The dotted-
dashed line shows the movement of a massless monomer. The
inset shows the part of the constriction that has been magni-
ﬁed.

To verify that this mechanism is not responsible for
the transition observed in the simulations, we modiﬁed
the model by changing its dynamics to that of an over-
damped system14 (Eq. (10)), which corresponds to tak-
ing the limit m → 0 or τ0 → 0. Unfortunately, this made
the computations very expensive, because the time step
of the integration had to be reduced by a factor of 100.
Thus we could only simulate short chains, and were un-
able to perform a thorough analysis. A few important
sets with N ≤ 100 beads have been recomputed. Typ-
ical trajectories of chains with N = 100 monomers at
E = 0.5E0 are shown in Fig. 16. The transition still oc-
curs in both directions. This proves that the fast state
is stabilized by another mechanism. In fact, the only no-
ticeable eﬀect of inertia was to suppress the transition for
short chains. In the overdamped system, the coexistence
region widens and the onset shifts to shorter chains.

Another conceivable mechanism which might favor and
stabilize the fast phase is based on diﬀusion. While the
polymer migrates along the wall in the narrow region and

around the corners, it can only diﬀuse upwards. This ef-
fect is enhanced by the tendency of the polymer, which
has been forced into a stretched conformation in the in-
homogeneous parts of the ﬁeld, to contract back to a
coil. The characteristic time scale for contraction is pre-
sumably related to the Rouse time and scales like N 1+2ν
with the chain length24, which would explain why the
slow state dominates at large chain length. However, we
have not yet been able to prove this explanation. System-
atic studies are diﬃcult, because the opposite transition
is triggered by diﬀusion as well.

C. Crossover point

Fig. 14 suggests that the transition can only take place
if the electrical ﬁeld exceeds a critical value. The inho-
mogeneous ﬁeld has to uncoil the chains and thus work
against the entropic spring force of the polymers. The
mean elongation hri of moderately stretched self-avoiding
polymers subject to a force f , which acts on the end
monomers, can be computed via32

hri = N a (f a/kBT )2/3 ,

(11)

where a ≈ 0.45σ is the proportionality constant in
Rg = aN ν. In our case, the force of course acts on all
monomers. Nevertheless, we shall use Eq. 11 to roughly
estimate the maximal eﬀect of the inhomogeneous ﬁeld
on a chain, with f ∝ E.

Our question is: How much does the ﬁeld have to
stretch a chain in order to stabilize a distinct slow state?
We consider the chain lengths Ncrossover at which both
states are equally populated. Assuming that it is suﬃ-
cient to stretch the chains by an amount proportional to
their own size, one would expect N E5/3 to be a constant
at N = Ncrossover. Alternatively, it might be necessary to
stretch the chain to a ﬁxed length, which is determined
by the size of the device. In that case, N E2/3 should be
constant.

This is tested in table II. The quantity Ncrossover · E5/3
is obviously not constant for diﬀerent electric ﬁelds E.
However, Ncrossover · E2/3 is almost constant,

Ncrossover · E2/3 ≈ const.(∼ (50 − 60)E2/3

),

0

(12)

as long as E is not too high. For large values of E, this
rule breaks down. On the other hand, inertia becomes
important at strong ﬁelds, as shown in Sec. VI B. Our
simulations with overdamped dynamics at E = 1E0 indi-
cate that at m → 0, chains already exhibit two migration
speeds at chain lengths N = 50 (data not shown). In-
deed, the rule (12) would predict Ncrossover ∼ 50. Unfortu-
nately, the quality of our data is not suﬃcient to establish
Ncrossover quantitatively in the overdamped case.

Nevertheless, the sum of our ﬁndings suggests that the
crossover length might be determined by the rule (12).
If this is correct, it would explain why the transition dis-
appears at small ﬁelds, E ≤ 0.04E0: For E = 0.04E0,
the Eq. (12) predicts a crossover length Ncrossover ∼ 500.
However, free chains of that length have an end-to-end
distance of Re ∼ 46σ, which is comparable to the chan-
nel width H. Hence a fast state, in which the chain is
essentially unperturbed, cannot exist.

This result suggests strategies for the design of mi-
crostructures which do or do not exhibit the two-state
behavior. We expect that the two-state coexistence can
be suppressed by choosing the channel width d in Fig.
2b small, and it can be promoted by making d larger.

VII. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

To summarize, we have presented Brownian dynam-
ics simulations and experimental studies of DNA migra-
tion in structured microchannels. Our simulations re-
produce earlier experimental results presented by Duong
et al.9 and explain the experimentally observed migra-
tion order of λ−DNA and T 2−DNA. We establish that
in channels with geometries as shown in Fig. 2, shorter
DNA molecules migrate faster for intermediate ﬁelds
than longer DNA molecules.

This behavior, which is opposite to that expected at
weaker ﬁelds, turns out to be the signature of a nonequi-
librium phase transition. At very high ﬁelds, or in much
larger structures, we found chains can migrate with two
distinctly diﬀerent speeds, assuming diﬀerent states of
migration. This was observed both experimentally and in
simulations. We have discussed the factors which stabi-

11

lize the two states and suggested strategies for the design
of channels which do or do not exhibit the transition.

Whereas in most applications, two migration states
are not wanted, channels which support two such states
might be useful in some cases. For example, such struc-
tures could be used to extract a certain amount of chains
from a sample. As illustrated in Fig. 14, the chains are
highly stretched during the transition from one state to
another. This could also be exploited, e. g., to expose
them to certain surface patterns. Additional interesting
eﬀects can be expected when chains in the two-state re-
gion are exposed to alternating (AC) ﬁelds.

The comparison of

simulations and experiments
demonstrates that our simple DNA model, which dis-
regards the electrostatic interactions, the hydrodynamic
interactions, and the ﬂow of the surrounding ﬂuid, never-
theless captures the essential physics of DNA migration
in our microchannels. However, we believe that the in-
terplay of DNA motion and buﬀer ﬂow should be investi-
gated more carefully. As mentioned in Sec. II B, the ex-
perimental electroosmotic mobility in straight channels
is of the same order of magnitude as the DNA mobil-
ity. In structured microchannels, where regions of strong
ﬁeld alternate with regions of weak ﬁeld, electroosmo-
sis should give rise to interesting nontrivial ﬂow patterns
which certainly inﬂuence the DNA mobility. Moreover,
the electrostatic and the hydrodynamic interactions are
not entirely screened in microchannels, which leads to
additional eﬀects28. In order to investigate such phenom-
ena, systematic experimental studies are necessary, and
eﬃcient new simulation methods need to be developed.
These shall be explored in the future.

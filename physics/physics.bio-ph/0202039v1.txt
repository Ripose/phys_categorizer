A novel THz near-ﬁeld spectrometer is presented which allows to perform biological and medical
studies with high spectral resolution combined with a spatial resolution down to λ/100.
In the
setup an aperture much smaller than the used wavelength is placed in the beam very close to
the sample. The sample is probed by the evanescent wave behind the aperture. The distance
is measured extremely accurate by a confocal microscope. We use monochromatic sources which
provide powerful coherent cw radiation tuneable from 50 GHz up to 1.5 THz. Transmission and
reﬂection experiments can be performed which enable us to study solids and molecules in aqueous
solution. Examples for spectroscopic investigations on biological tissues are presented.

I. INTRODUCTION

During recent years there have been many eﬀorts to
understand in detail how cells function. To cope this
complex problem, it is necessary to examine the compo-
nents of the system, like DNA, bio-molecules, proteins,
cell-membrans. Due to the large entities and the high
density of electronic, vibrational and rotational states
in these bio-molecules, spectroscopic investigations in
the millimeter, submillimeter, and far-infrared spectral
range (often called THz range) seem to be an appro-
priate method for this task. However, the dimensions
of the samples under study are rather small, often well
below Abbe’s diﬀraction limit, implying that in the mil-
limeter to far-infrared spectral range it is not possible to
perform measurements by standard optical methods. In
addition to the scientiﬁc point of view, the THz range
of frequency attracts considerable attention because of
possible applications, in particular with the aim of THz
imaging. While a number of groups try to peruse time
domain technique utilizing short laser pulses in order to
generate a broad spectrum terahertz radiation [1,2], we
improved the well developed technique in the frequency
domain. Since most biological and medical investigations
will required measurements of molecules in aqueous solu-
tion and water is highly absorbing in the THz range, we
have developed a reﬂection setup in addition to simple
transmission arrangements.

The frequency range between microwaves and infrared
has proven to be particularly challenging to experimen-
talists since it falls right between the range of guided
waves (coaxial and microwave technique) and optical
techniques (free space propagation). Microwave oscilla-
tors are in general not tunable over a larger range of fre-
quency and/or deliver only a very small output power;
hence they basically cannot be employed above 100 GHz.
Coming from optical methods, standard infrared spec-
troscopy using Fourier transform interferometer has to

cope with two problems by trying to go to lower fre-
quencies: (i) the output power of the thermal radiation
sources vanishes for ω → 0 following Planck’s law of black
body radiation; (ii) the spot size to which the light can be
focused for measurements is diﬀraction limited to approx-
imately the wavelength. Here we present a new approach
to overcome this limitations by utilizing monochromatic
but tunable backward wave oscillators as powerful ra-
diation sources and a near-ﬁeld microscope in order to
perform microspectrometry in the THz range.

wave oscillators is split by wire grids. The length of the in-
terference arm can be adjusted by moving mirror 2. After
the sample is introduced, the interferometer is readjusted in
order to obtain the phase diﬀerence.

The use of backward wave oscillators as radiation
sources for spectroscopic measurement in the frequency
range from 1 cm−1 to 50 cm−1 (f = 30 GHz to 1.5 THz;
λ = 0.2 mm to 10 mm) was developed in the group of
G. Kozlov during the last twenty years [3,4]. With a

cw output power of 1 to 200 mW reliable optical experi-
ments can be performed with a very short data acquisi-
tion time. The radiation can be tuned in frequency with
an accuracy and stability of 10−6 allowing to map very
narrow absorption lines. The radiation is detected either
by a Golay cell or by a silicon bolometer, which is cooled
down to 1.2 K. The spectrometer has a dynamical range
of up to 107. Experiments can be performed either in re-
ﬂection or transmission, where a Mach-Zehnder interfer-
ometer (Fig. 1) also allows to probe the change in phase
and thus to evaluate the real and imaginary part of the
electrodynamic response without performing a Kramers-
Kronig analysis [5]. Since a quasi-optical arrangement is
limited by diﬀraction and standing-wave problems, sam-
ples smaller than approximately three times the wave-
length cannot be investigated.

III. NEAR-FIELD SETUP

We have developed a THz near-ﬁeld microscope which
allows us to perform reﬂection measurement on spot sizes
down to λ/100. As displayed in Fig. 2, the setup consists
of a near-ﬁeld unit mounted rotatable by 90 degrees (1);
one axis is used for a quasi-optical spectrometer (2), and
the second by a confocal microscope (3) for distance con-
trol.

FIG. 2.

Schematic of the THz near-ﬁeld spectrometer.
The sample is placed in the near-ﬁeld unit (1); the spectro-
scopic measurements are done by a coherent source spectrom-
eter (2); the distance control and measurement is done by a
confocal micorscope (3).

The spectroscopic investigations are done with a co-
herent source spectrometer similar to the one discribed

2

above in Sec. II just arranged for reﬂection measure-
ments. The cw beam generated by backward wave oscil-
lators is mechanically chopped and focussed on the pin-
hole by teﬂon leses. Within a few seconds it can be elec-
tronically tuned over the full range of the oscillator. The
reﬂected beam is guided to the bolometer by a wire-grid
beam splitter.

FIG. 3. Schematic of the near-ﬁeld unit, consisting of pin-
hole (1a), piezo bender (1b), piezo motors (1c), sample (1d),
and sample holder (1e).

The core part of the near-ﬁeld spectrometer is a small
pinhole(1) which is drilled in a copper foil (thickness 1 to
10 µm) with diameter as small as 1 µm and which gen-
erates the evanescent submillimeter wave the sample is
probed with (Fig. 3). Behind the pinhole sits the sample
(1d) which can be translated relative to the pinhole by
three linear piezo-motors (1c). These motors are based
on stick and slip motion with a step size of 40 to 400 nm.
There is a fourth motor for moving the sample and pin-
hole together, which is required for the distance control
via the confocal microscope. The distance between pin-
hole and sample is modulated up to ±70 µm with high
frequencies (about 1 kHz) by an additional piezo-electric
bender (1b) in order to using look-in technique for data
acquisition. The near-ﬁeld unit is installed on an rotat-
able frame for performing THz measurements on the one
side and the distance control on the other side.

An accurate distance control is necessary because of
the strong dependence of the signal on the distance be-
tween pinhole and sample. It is performed by a image-
processing confocal microscope [Fig. 2, (3)], which was
developed by Tiziani et al. [6]. Therefore the light of an
infrared LED (3a) is focused on the sample via a rotat-
ing microlens array (3d). The reﬂected light is measured
by a CCD camera (3h). Because of the low depth of
focus, which is produced by the microlens array, the re-
ﬂection has a maximum if the sample sits exactly in the
focus of the last lens (3f). By moving pinhole and sample
relatively to this lens a three dimensional quantitativ im-
age originates, from which the distance between pinhole
and sample can be measured with a precision of 100 nm
within an adequate time.

FIG. 4.

Scan over an interface between a microwave ab-

sorber and silver.

Fig. 4 demonstrates the resolution of the near-ﬁeld
spectrometer. The pinhole was scanned over an interface
between a microwave absorbing ﬁlm and a silver ﬁlm,
both deposited on a glass substrate. The increase of re-
ﬂectivity within a width of 200 µm, which corresponds to
the diameter of the pinhole, can clearly be seen. With an
used frequency of 180 GHz (λ = 1.7 mm) the near-ﬁeld
ratio λ/d is about 10. Additional mathematical treat-
ment (deconvolution) can be used to improve the spa-
tial resolution considerably. Details of the experimental
setup will be discussed in [7].

IV. SPECTROSCOPIC MEASUREMENTS

Due to the strong dependence of the oscillators’ out-
put power on the frequency and due to the frequency-
dependent absorption of the components of the optical
spectrometer (lenses, grids, ...), measurements of abso-
lute value of the reﬂectivity require to perform a reference
measurement on an ideal reﬂecting sample (e.g. a silver
mirror). If only spectroscopic features have to be identi-
ﬁed, diﬀerence spectra are suﬃcient which were taken of
two materials, at two diﬀerent sample positions, or two
states diﬀerent in other respect.

Spectra of two biological samples: a) The solid
line shows the reﬂectivity of the meat part normalized on the
reﬂectivity of the fat part of Black Forest ham, averaged on
three points each. b) Ratio of the reﬂected power of chicken
bone and of chicken cartilage. The dotted lines demonstrates
the reproducibility by the 100% line of the spectrometer.

Employing this near-ﬁeld reﬂection spectrometer, we
have performed investigations on a variety of biological
and medical samples. As an example Fig. 5a exhibits the
reﬂectivity of the meat part of Black Forest Ham rela-
tive to the fat part in the frequency range from 5.5 cm−1
to 8.5 cm−1. The circular pinhole used was 200 µm in
diameter in a 10 µm thick copper foil. The distance
between pinhole and sample was 3.0 µm. To rule out
inhomogeneities of the sample we performed three mea-
surements on diﬀerent the meat part as well as on the fat
part and averaged them. The reproducibility of the main
features and the homogeneity of the sample are demon-
strated by dividing data sets taken at diﬀerent positions,
ideally leading to a 100% line (dotted line). The spectro-
scopic distinction between meat and fat become obvious
when the ratio of the spectra is plotted (solid line).

Similar experiments have been performed on chicken
bone which has a much lower water content and thus a
smaller reﬂection coeﬃcient. Fig. 5b shows the ratio of
the the reﬂected power of the bone and of the cartilage.
Again the spatial resolution is less than 200 µm.

V. SPECTROSCOPIC IMAGING

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

In both spectra we ﬁnd unexpectedly sharp and strong
features; in certain ranges the reﬂected power is 5 times
as high in cartilage compared to the chicken bone, for
instance. This indicates strong absorption lines which
may serve as a spectroscopic signature of the material.
While at presence we cannot reliably assign the lines,
we already want to note the possibility of using these
large diﬀerences for imaging. Diﬀerential images may
be a very sensitive tool to probe the spatial distribution
of certain molecules with a resolution in the microme-
ter range. For this purpose only two distinct frequencies
have to be measured which is easily possible by our spec-
trometer and which reduces the measurements time by
orders of magnitude. This technique allows to selectively
map out the composition of samples.

This study has been carried out with ﬁnancial sup-
port from the Commission of the European Communities,
speciﬁc RTD program ‘Quality of Life and Management
of Living Resources’, QLK4-CT-2000-00129 “Tera-Hertz
Radiation In Biological Research, Investigation on Diag-
nostics and Study on Potential Genotoxic Eﬀects”.
It
does not necessarily reﬂects its view and in no way an-
ticipates the Commissions future policy in this area.

VI. CONCLUSION

We have developed a new microspectrometer to per-
form spectroscopic experiments in the THz range with a
large frequency resolution of 107. The use of near-ﬁeld
technique enables us to obtain a spatial resolution down
to several micrometers. With a reﬂection setup we can
investigate biological samples in aqueous solution. The
instrument also provides spectro-images which show the
spatial distribution of biological molecules with a high
spatial resolution. This novel technique has an enormous
potential for a variety of biological and medical applica-
tions.

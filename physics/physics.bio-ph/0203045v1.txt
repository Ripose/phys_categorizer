Abstract: The speciﬁc morphology of germinal centers is analyzed in the context
of the optimization of the humoral immune response. The relevance of dark and
light zones for the aﬃnity maturation process is investigated in the framework of a
theoretical model for the germinal center reaction. Especially, it is shown that an
intermediate appearance of dark zones in germinal center reactions is advantageous
for the process of antibody optimization.

Keywords: Immune system, germinal center, morphology, aﬃnity maturation,
lymphocytes, centroblasts, centrocytes, B-cell kinetics.

1 Introduction

An important part of the humoral immune response is the germinal center (GC)
reaction. GCs are responsible for an optimization process of antibodies with respect
to a speciﬁc antigen. This process is called aﬃnity maturation: During the GC
reaction new plasma cells are generated which secern antibodies of considerably
higher aﬃnity to the antigen.

The GC reaction is initiated by antigen-activated B-cells that migrate into the
follicle system. Here, they start to proliferate in the environment of follicular den-
dritic cells (FDCs). The initiation is believed to be of oligoclonal character, i.e. the
number of seeder B-cells is small and of the order of three1,2,3,4. After three days of
fast monoclonal expansion – the total number of proliferating B-cells (centroblasts)
reaches about 12000 – a phase of somatic hypermutation is started.5,6,7,8 The diver-
sity of encoded antibodies is enhanced in this way. The centroblasts diﬀerentiate
into antibody-presenting centrocytes9 and an apoptotic process is initiated. How-
ever, they have the possibility to get into interaction with the antigen-presenting
FDCs and with T-helper cells.
It is believed that this interaction depends on
the aﬃnity of antibody and antigen, and that those centrocytes which successfully
bind the antigen are rescued from apoptosis.10,11,12,13,14,15 This provides a more-step
selection process16 of those B-cells with high aﬃnity to the antigen. Positively se-
lected B-cells further diﬀerentiate into plasma- and memory-cells (shortly denoted
as output cells). In this way the answer of the immune system is optimized with
respect to the antigen.

The GC shows a very speciﬁc morphology. The proliferating and mutating
centroblasts are collected in the dark zone. Centrocytes and FDCs build the light
zone. Such zones have been observed in experiments.2,17 Nevertheless, it is still
unclear, how long the dark zone remains present during a GC reaction. The total
duration of a GC reaction is about 21 days.2,3,18 Dark zones have been observed to
appear at day 4 and to vanish at day 8.17 However, there also exists evidence for
dark zones of longer duration.2

In the present article a possible correlation of the GC morphology and aﬃnity
maturation is investigated. To this end, a mathematical model19 is used which
includes the cell interactions as well as their spatial distribution and movement.
To our knowledge this model is up to now the only attempt to simulate the mor-
phological organisation and dynamics of the GC. Other mathematical models of
the GC did not include a spatial resolution of the GC.20,21,22,23,24,25

The principles of the model are summarized and shortly described in Sec. 2.
All principles are in narrow connection to the present experimental knowledge, and
the model language is formulated in terms of physiological quantities. The latter
are determined by corresponding measurements. The resulting values are used
in this article. An analysis of the robustness of the results has been performed

2

previously.19,20 Here, we aim to report one major outcome of the model including an
optimized statistic of the analysis (Sec. 3). In addition we propose an interpretation
and possible implications of the results (Sec. 4).

2 Methods

A short description of a previously introduced mathematical model for the mor-
phological organisation and cell dynamics of the GC19 is provided in this section.
The GC is simulated on an equidistant two-dimensional lattice with lattice con-
stant 10 µm. This corresponds to the average cell diameter of B-cells in GCs. The
radius of the lattice is 220 µm, corresponding to a typical radius of a GC. Each
lattice point can be occupied by exactly one centroblast, centrocyte, or output cell.
All cells move on the lattice through diﬀusion. Other concepts of cell motility in
GCs are currently under investigation.26 The diﬀusion constants are adapted cor-
responding to the diﬀerent diameters of centroblasts and centrocytes.1,27,28 FDCs
are represented by a soma at one lattice point and four (in 2 dimensions) dendritic
arms of 30 µm length. FDCs are assumed to be immobile which basically has an
impact on the interaction frequency with B-cells.19

It has been previously shown that the development of dark zones requires a non-
local cell-cell interaction.19 Such an interaction may be provided by a chemotaxis
gradient which acts on the motility of centrocytes and stems from FDC and/or
T-cells and/or naive B-cells in the mantle zone.26 Another possibility (which will
be used in this work) is a diﬀusing signal molecule which is produced by FDCs or
T-cells and bound by centroblasts.19 Note, that this implies a separation of signals
acting on proliferation and diﬀerentiation of centroblasts, as has been proposed
in corresponding experiments.29 The signal molecules are clustered in quanta that
diﬀuse on the lattice according to a classical diﬀusion equation. The diﬀusion is
not inﬂuenced by the presence of cells at the same lattice point. One quantum
corresponds to the signal concentration that is necessary to initiate the centroblast
diﬀerentiation process into centrocytes. Using this non-local concept an intermedi-
ate dark zone is produced.19 The duration of the dark zone is basically depending
on the amount of secerned signal molecules and its diﬀusion constant. The ratio of
centroblast diﬀerentiation and proliferation rates changes the duration of the dark
zone as well. However, this ratio also has inﬂuence on the total life time of the GC
as a whole and, therefore, is determined independently.

The aﬃnity of the encoded antibodies to the antigen is formulated with the
well known shape space concept.30 Each type of antibody is represented on a four-
dimensional lattice which is ordered in such a way, that neighboring points have
similar aﬃnity to the antigen. A hypermutation is represented by a jump to
a neighbor point. The aﬃnity between the antibodies on a centrocyte and the

3

antigen on an FDC is modeled by a gaussian aﬃnity weight function centered at
the optimal antibody type.20

The dynamical properties of the diﬀerent cells types on the lattice are summa-
rized in the following. On the quantitative level the parameter values have been
determined using experimental constraints.
In many cases the parameters were
directly accessible from experiment. Others had to be determined indirectly using
experimental observations of the general GC properties (for more details we refer
to19,20).

• Centroblasts proliferate with a (constant) rate of 1/6 hr.2,31,32 At each di-
vision a somatic hypermutation occurs with the probability 1/2.33,34 They
diﬀerentiate in dependence on a diﬀerentiation signal that is secerned by
the FDCs, and diﬀuses over the lattice. The diﬀerentiation process is acti-
vated when a centroblast meets a threshold quantum of diﬀerentiation signal
at the same lattice point. Activated centroblasts diﬀerentiate with a rate of
1/6 hr into centrocytes.2,35,36 A ﬁnite life time of centroblasts is not imposed.
However, the eﬀective life time is shorter than 1 day due to centroblast dif-
ferentiation.

• Centrocytes die with a rate of 1/7 hr.27 They bind to the FDCs accord-
ing to the aﬃnity to the antigen represented by an aﬃnity weight function.
Bound centrocytes remain bound for 2 hr.37,38 They are thought to be rescued
from apoptosis during this time. Positively selected centrocytes further dif-
ferentiate with a rate of 1/7 hr into either re-proliferating centroblasts (with
probability 80%),20 or into output cells (with probability 20%). The diﬀer-
entiation into output cells is delayed by 48 hr with respect to the starting
time of hypermutation,5,20,39 i.e. it starts at day 6 of the GC reaction.

• Output cells leave the GC by diﬀusion and do not further interact with

other cells in the GC.

• Dead cells are eliminated from the GC.

The simulations are started with 3 randomly distributed seeder B-cells and 20
FDCs. The fact that centroblasts proliferate at least in parts outside the FDC
network during their proliferation phase turned out to be a necessary requirement
for the development of dark zones.19 This is ensured by a random distribution of
the FDCs on 70% of the (maximum) GC volume. The seeder cells are of low but
non-vanishing aﬃnity to the antigen. They can reach the optimal antibody-type
with 5 to 10 mutations.4,40 The simulations are insensitive to a change of the time-
step-width which is 0.004 hr for the presented results. In a stochastic model the
outcome of the simulation depends on the used generator of random numbers and

4

on its initialization. Therefore, the results are given with a standard deviation
corresponding to this uncertainty.

3 Results

At ﬁrst some basic properties of the GC reaction are reported as generated by
the model simulation. Assuming the already introduced centroblast diﬀerentiation

signal (secerned by FDCs and bound by centroblasts) a dark zone develops.
appears at day 4 of the reaction, and remains stable for a duration that depends on
the production rate of the signal molecules. In order to simulate diﬀerent durations
of dark zones, the signal production rate is varied. For each production rate the
diﬀerentiation rate of centroblast is adjusted correspondingly (within physiological
constraints) in order to ensure a comparable ﬁnal state of the GC after 21 days
of the reaction. The development of the dark zone as well as its depletion are not
principally aﬀected by the variation of other parameters within their physiological
constraints. For example a smaller proliferation rate basically stretches the whole
GC reaction without changing the general behavior.

The time course of the total GC volume is in accordance with experimental
observations2,41 provided that the dark zone vanishes between day 6.5 and 10 of the
GC reaction (i.e. that the signal production rate is chosen correspondingly): After
an exponential increase of the total cell population, a maximum is reached after 4
days of the reaction. The total cell population then is diminished steadily until the
end of the reaction after 21 days. At this time only about 50 proliferating B-cells
remain in the GC.2,18 Taking these results together, the general GC morphology is
well described by the model results.

The average aﬃnity of B-cells is enhanced during the whole GC reaction. This
is best illustrated by looking at a typical example with a dark zone present until
day 8.3.
In Fig. 1 the time course of the fraction of high aﬃnity centroblasts
and centrocytes is shown.19 High aﬃnity denotes those B-cells which bind the
antigen with a probability of more than 30%. As can be seen, such a cell does
not exist at the beginning of the GC reaction. They develop after the start of
somatic hypermutations after 3 days. Still one observes a short delay because
some mutations have to occur before the ﬁrst cells appear that have an above
threshold aﬃnity to the antigen. Then the relative number of high aﬃnity cells
grows steadily. In accordance with experiment, good cells already dominate around
day 10 of the GC reaction.5 One observes an intermediate steep increase, that
approximately starts when the dark zone is depleted. This correlation does not
seem to be obvious in view of this single example. However, it has been observed
in all simulations, especially in those with diﬀerent dark zone durations. In the
late phase of the GC reaction the curve reaches a plateau on a high level, and

5

practically all B-cells are high aﬃnity cells.

In the same ﬁgure the fraction of high aﬃnity output cells is shown. This curve
does not show the value at each moment of the GC reaction but the sum of all
output cells that has been produced until time t. This value is a measure for the
total quality of the produced output cells. When the ﬁrst high aﬃnity output cell
is produced at day 5 of the reaction, the total output quality is increased according
to its aﬃnity. Subsequently, the quality of the output cells is steadily increased
during the GC reaction. The part of high aﬃnity output cells reaches 77% in
the present example. The average over all simulation with dark zones that vanish
between day 8.5 and 10.5 of the reaction is 75.2% ± 4.2% (the error is one standard
deviation). In view of the fact that at the beginning of the GC reaction no high
aﬃnity B-cell existed at all, this aﬃnity enhancement is remarkable.

The main task of the present article is to analyze a possible correlation of the
duration of the dark zone and the achieved aﬃnity maturation, i.e. the total output
quality at the end of the reaction. This analysis has to be based on comparable
GC simulation. By changing the production rate of the centroblast diﬀerentiation
signal molecule not only the duration of the dark zone is varied. Also the total
duration of the reaction is changed. As stated at the beginning of this section,
the centroblast diﬀerentiation rate is adjusted correspondingly so that the ﬁnal
numbers of B-cells N after 21 days of the reaction are of the same range. This
is especially important as the aﬃnity maturation process depends on the value
of N.19 The average number of B-cells for all 226 simulations is N = 49 ± 23.
The error denotes one standard deviation. Only those simulations are taken into
account that generate a ﬁnal number of B-cells N within one standard deviation
of this average value. The remaining simulations are grouped according to the
duration of the dark zone (see Tab. 1). Note, that due to the described procedure
the simulations within each group have similar average N.

The output quality is plotted against the duration of the dark zone (see Fig. 2).
The quality of the produced output cells becomes optimized for dark zones that
vanish between day 7 and 11 of the GC reaction. For shorter and longer dark
zones, the resulting quality of the output cells is reduced. It can be deduced from
Tab. 1 that the same holds true for the total number of output cells.

4 Discussion

We used a previously developed model to elucidate a possible correlation between
the duration of the dark zone and the eﬃciency of the aﬃnity maturation process.
In a ﬁrst step the simulated GCs were compared to GCs observed in experiment.
The essential properties of real GC reactions were reproduced correctly. This
includes the appearance of the dark zone, the time course of the total volume, as

6

well as the reached aﬃnity maturation.

It has been previously found19 that dark zones do not appear in simulations that
are based on local cell interactions only. Therefore, it was necessary to introduce
an non-local cell interaction into the model in order to understand the intermedi-
ate appearance of dark zones as observed in experiment.17 This has been realized
using a centroblast diﬀerentiation signal molecule that is secerned by FDCs and
consumed by the centroblasts. Such a signal molecule has to be understood as
a hypothesis, because it still remains unclear how the centroblast diﬀerentiation
process is initiated in real GC reaction. However, there are experimental hints that
centroblast diﬀerentiate due to an interaction with FDCs or T-helper cells.29,42,43
Most parameters in the model are strongly constrained by experimental data,19
so that the possiblity of varying the parameters is restricted. However, the produc-
tion of the diﬀerentiation signal (as not directly observed in experiment) does not
underly such a restriction. It turned out that the duration of dark zones strongly
depends on the production rate of the diﬀerentiation signal. The duration of the
dark zone is most sensitive to this rate compared to other model parameters. This
situation opens the possibility to vary the signal production rate and in this way to
test the aﬃnity maturation process of GCs with dark zones of various duration. A
corresponding test is not possible in experiment as in experiments one is restricted
to GCs that are realized in nature.

A statistical analysis of simulations with various durations of dark zones (i.e.
various production rates of the diﬀerentiation signal) leads to the conclusion that
the quality of the output cells averaged over all produced output cells during the
whole GC reaction is optimized for intermediately appearing dark zones vanishing
between day 7 and 11 of the GC reaction. Note that also the quantity of produced
output cells is optimized for those dark zone durations.
In addition, the time
course of the total GC volume is in agreement with time courses observed for the
same dark zone durations.19 These are also typical dark zone durations as they
have been observed in experiment.17

This result suggests a relation of two, at ﬁrst sight, very diﬀerent categories:
The GC morphology and aﬃnity maturation of B-cells. The morphology of the GC
is basically determined by a non-local interaction with other cell-types. However,
the function of the speciﬁc GC morphology is not restricted to a spatial arrange-
ment of interacting cells. One may suspect that speciﬁc cell arrangements are
advantageous for the success of the GC reaction. The duration of the dark zone
does not only seem to describe the time course of the cell distribution in GCs but
also to be a critical parameter for the quality and amount of output of the GC
reaction. This leads to the question of how the spatial distribution of centroblasts
and centrocytes inﬂuences the aﬃnity maturation process.

On one hand the existence of the dark zone is necessary to produce a large

7

pool of diﬀerent B-cell types, i.e. a high diversity of encoded antibody-types. This
diversiﬁcation is optimally realized with a fast proliferation of centroblasts without
major interaction to antigens. The mutations are likely to occur randomly44 and it
is supposed that starting from low (but non-vanishing) aﬃnity seeder cells better
B-cells are found during this process. The diversiﬁcation process continues in the
dark zone when the selection process has already started. Note that recycled B-
cells that return into the dark zone don’t have been observed in the simulations.19
Therefore, the B-cells that proliferate in the dark zone are not recycled B-cells but
directly stem from the original seeder cells.

After about 8 days some high aﬃnity cells have been found and identiﬁed in
the selection process that takes place in the light zone. Those roughly optimized
B-cells are mostly recycled cells45 and restart to proliferate. A further enhance-
ment of aﬃnity to the antigen is based on these preselected B-cells. One may
think of an ongoing process of diversiﬁcation in the dark zone. However, the cells
produced in this random process cannot overcome a certain B-cell quality. There-
fore, a re-proliferation of already selected B-cells is more promising for the further
development of the GC reaction. This process resembles a directioned selection
process that replaces the random process in the dark zone. Ongoing proliferation
and mutation in the dark zone do not only become senseless (as the quality of the
cells in the dark zone are below the average B-cell quality in the light zone). They
would also hinder the optimization process in the light zone because B-cells of
relatively low aﬃnity would take part in the selection process. Consequently, the
selection of high aﬃnity cells would be inhibited by a senseless repetition of a ﬁrst
selection process with B-cells stemming from the dark zone. An early depletion of
the dark zone eliminates the low aﬃnty B-cells from the GC and in this way allows
a ﬁne-tuning of preselected B-cells.

This interpretation of the necessity of the early depletion of dark zones in GC
reactions is directly coupled to the cell distribution in GCs, i.e. to its morphology.
A diversiﬁcation is possible only if the centroblasts proliferate and mutate outside
the FDC network. Later in the GC reaction a ﬁne-tuning of already preselected
B-cells has necessarily to take place in the direct neighborhood of the antigen
presenting FDCs. The existence of a dark zone inhibits aﬃnity maturation in this
phase and a homogeneous distribution of centroblasts and centrocytes in the FDC
network is more advantageous for the development of the GC reaction.

One should be aware that this interpretation only provides a possible explana-
tion of the correlation between morphology and aﬃnity maturation that has been
found in the framework of a spatial model for GCs. The basic concepts used here
are in accordance with a widely accepted picture of GCs. However, a possible
function of the speciﬁc morphology of GCs for the success of GC reactions is an
important part of the understanding of processes inside GCs.

Figures and Tables

Figure 1: Aﬃnity enhancement:
The time course of the fraction of high aﬃnity cells (cells which bind the antigen with
a probability of at least 30%) in the GC reaction is shown for centroblasts, centrocytes,
and for the sum of all output cells produced until time t of the GC reaction.

Table 1: The sequence of data points in Fig. 2. All simulations that end up with
49 ± 23 B-cells at day 21 of the GC reaction (this is the average value of all performed
226 simulations) are taken into account. The simulations are grouped according to
the dark zone durations T (in days). Each value of T corresponds to one data point
in Fig. 2. The number of simulations n and the average number of remaining B-cells
N within these simulations are given for each data point. The fraction of high aﬃnity
output cells f (in %) at day 21 of the GC reaction and the total number of produced
output cells O are given. The errors correspond to one standard deviation.

We address the problem of understanding the variable abundance of 3-node and 4-node subgraphs
(motifs) in complex networks from a dynamical point of view. As a criterion in the determination
of the functional signiﬁcance of a n-node subgraph, we propose an analytic method to measure
the stability of the synchronous state (SSS) the subgraph displays. We ﬁnally show that, in those
biological networks where synchronization is a relevant issue, the SSS of a given motif is potentially
correlated with its relative abundance.

Recent empirical evidences indicate that complex net-
works, among other common properties, are character-
ized by the presence of various length cycles and speciﬁc
motifs
[1, 2, 3]. A motif M is a pattern of intercon-
nections occurring either in a undirected or in a directed
graph G at a number signiﬁcantly higher than in ran-
in graphs with the
domized versions of the graph, i.e.
same number of nodes and links (and eventually degree
distribution) as the original one, but where the links are
distributed at random. As a pattern of interconnections,
is usually meant a small connected (undirected or di-
rected) n-node graph M which is a subgraph of G. The
concept of motifs was originally introduced by U. Alon
and coworkers, who studied motifs in biological and non-
biological networks [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The research of the
signiﬁcant motifs in a graph G is based on matching algo-
rithms counting the total number of occurrences of each
n-node subgraph M in the original graph and in the ran-
domized ones. The statistical signiﬁcance of M is then
described by the Z-score, deﬁned as: ZM = #M −h#rand
M i
,
where #M is the number of times the subgraph M ap-
pears in G, and h#rand
M i and σrand
#M are, respectively, the
mean and standard deviation of the number of appear-
ances in the randomized network ensemble [5, 7]. The
reasons of the variable frequency of diﬀerent n-node sub-
graphs in a speciﬁc network are still poorly understood.
There are at least two possible explanations. On the one
hand, it is possile that certain constraints on the growth
mechanism of a network as a whole determine which mo-
tifs become abundant [9, 10]. On the other hand, it is well
known that the structure has important consequences on
the network dynamics and functional robustness. So that
a particular n-node graph can become overrepresented
because, due to its structure, it possesses some relevant
functional properties [5].

In this letter, we address the question of network motifs
in biological networks from a dynamic systems point of
view. Naturally, a comprehensive analysis of the dynam-
ics of networks is considerably more complicated than the

corresponding analysis of their structure. This is due to
the potentially complex functional dependencies between
nodes, and to lack of knowledge of the speciﬁc interac-
tion parameters. For such a reason, instead of modeling
in details one particular biological network, we analyze
the generic dynamic properties that arise from the topol-
In particular, we focus on the
ogy of a n-node graph.
emergence of collective dynamic behaviors, such as syn-
chronization, that is relevant in many biological systems,
and we propose an analytic method to estimate the sta-
bility of the synchronous state (SSS) displayed by a n-
node graph. We ﬁnally show that the SSS, potentially,
can help explaining why certain network motifs are over-
represented in some real biological networks, while others
are not.

We assume that the dynamics of a n-node motif M can

be represented as a system of n ODE’s:

˙xi = fi(x1, x2, . . . , xn)

i = 1, . . . , n

(1)

where xi ∈ Rm is the m-dimensional vector describing
the state of node i (for instance the concentration of
molecule i in a metabolic reaction, or the polarization
state of neuron i in a neural network), and fi : Rm×n →
Rm is the function representing the eﬀects on xi of all
the nodes connected to i. In particular, we are neglect-
ing the inﬂuence of the other nodes of the graph G on the
n-node motif M , and we are assuming that the fi’s do not
contain an explicit dependence on time. The issue of the
stability of the steady states of Eqs. (1), i.e. the sets of
values (x∗
n) such that ˙x∗
n = 0,
has been investigated in Ref. [11]. Here we focus on the
stability of the synchronized dynamics of Eqs. (1), which
can be treated analytically within the context of the so-
called Master Stability Function approach [3, 12, 13, 14].
In particular, we restrict to the case in which the equa-
tions of motion can be written as:

2 = . . . = ˙x∗

2, . . . , x∗

1 = ˙x∗

1, x∗

˙xi = Fi(xi) + σ Pn

j=1 aij[Hij (xj) − Hii(xi)]

i = 1, . . . , n.
(2)

where Fi(x) : Rm → Rm is the function governing the
local dynamics of node i, Hij(xj ) : Rm → Rm describes
the inﬂuence of node j on node i, σ > 0 is the coupling
strength, and aij are the elements of the n × n adjacency
matrix of graph M . In the case of a undirected n-node
motif M , aij = aji = 1 iﬀ there is an edge joining node i
and node j, and aij = aji = 0 otherwise. In the case of a
directed motif, we assume aij = 1 iﬀ there is a directed
edge from node j to node i, while aij = 0 otherwise.
Equations (2) can be rewritten as:

˙xi = Fi(xi) − σ Pn

j=1 lijHij (xj)

i = 1, . . . , n.

(3)

where lij = δij(Pl ail) − aij are the elements of a zero
row-sum (Pj lij = 0 ∀i) n × n matrix L with strictly
positive diagonal terms (lii > 0 ∀i). In the case of a undi-
rected motif M , L is symmetric and coincides with the
standard Laplacian matrix of the graph M [3]. In the case
of a directed graph, the oﬀ-diagonal elements lij of L are
respectively equal to −aij, while the i-th diagonal entry
is equal to the in-degree of node i, kin
i = Pl ail. In order
to proceed with the analytic treatment, we make the ex-
plicit assumption that the network is made of n identical
and identically coupled dynamical systems. This corre-
sponds to take in Eqs. (2) and Eqs. (3) Fi(xi) ≡ F(x) ∀i,
and Hij(xj ) ≡ H(x) ∀i, j. This assumption and the fact
that L is zero-row sum, ensure the existence of an in-
variant set x1(t) = x2(t) = · · · = xn(t) ≡ xs(t), repre-
senting the complete synchronization manifold S. The
main idea, ﬁrst proposed by Pecora and Carrol [12],
is that the linear stability analysis of the synchronized
state of Eqs. (3) can be divided into a topological and
a dynamical part [12, 14]. Since the coupling term of
Eqs. (3) vanishes exactly on S, a necessary condition for
the stability of the synchronous state is that the set of
(n − 1) ∗ m Lyapunov exponents corresponding to phase
space directions transverse to the synchronization man-
ifold are entirely made of negative values. Considering,
then, the m × n column vectors X = (x1, x2, . . . , xn)T
and δX = (δx1, . . . , δxn)T , where δxi(t) = xi(t) − xs(t)
is the deviation of the ith vector state from the synchro-
nization manifold, one gets the variational equation:

δ ˙X = [In ⊗ JF(xs) − σL ⊗ JH(xs)] δX,

(4)

where In is the n × n identity matrix, ⊗ stands for the
direct product between matrices, and J denotes the Jaco-
bian operator. The ﬁrst term in Eq. (4) is block diagonal
with m × m blocks, while the second term can be treated
by diagonalizing L.

We ﬁrst concentrate on the case of undirected mo-
tifs, i.e. on symmetric and thus diagonalizable lapla-
cian L. Let λi be the set of n real eigenvalues of L
(Lvi = λivi, i = 1, . . . , n), and vi the associated or-
thonormal eigenvectors (vT
j · vi = δij). If L is symmet-
ric, all its eigenvalues are real, and they can be ordered
by size as: 0 = λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ . . . ≤ λn. The arbitrary

2

state δX can be written as δX = Pn
vi ⊗ ζi(t), where
ζi ≡ (ζ1,i, . . . , ζm,i). By substituting into Eq. (4), and
using the condition that the eigenvectors are linearly in-
dependent, one is ﬁnally left with a block diagonalized
variational equation, with each of the n blocks having the
form of a variational equation for the coeﬃcient ζk(t):

i=1

dζk
dt

= Kkζk,

k = 1, . . . , n

(5)

where Kk = [JF(xs) − σλkJH(xs)] is the evolution ker-
nel. Each equation in (5) corresponds to a set of m con-
ditional Lyapunov exponents along the eigenmode cor-
responding to the speciﬁc eigenvalue λk. For k = 1,
λ1 = 0, and we have the variational equation for the syn-
chronized manifold S. The m corresponding conditional
Lyapunov exponents equal those of the single uncoupled
system ˙x = F(x), therefore no conditions on them will
be imposed (in principle, the synchronized state itself can
well have positive Lyapunov exponents and be chaotic).
Notice that the Jacobian JF(xs) and JH(xs) are the
same for each block k, since they are evaluated on the
synchronized state. Consequently, the form of each of the
blocks in Eqs. (5) is the same, with the only diﬀerence be-
ing in the multiplier λk. This leads one to replace σλk by
ν in Eq. (5), and to consider the generic m-dimensional
variational equation:

˙ζ = Kνζ = [JF(xs) − νJH(xs)] ζ,

(6)

from which one can extract the set of m conditional
Lyapunov exponents as a function of the real parame-
ter ν ≥ 0. The parametrical behavior of the largest of
such exponents, Λ(ν), is called Master Stability Function
[12, 13, 14]. In fact, given a coupling strength σ, one can
locate the point σλk on the positive ν axis, and the sign
of Λ at that point will reveal the stability of that eigen-
mode. If Λ(σλk) < 0 ∀k = 2, ..., n, then the synchronous
state is stable at the coupling strength σ.

In order to evaluate whether the stability of the syn-
chronous state is favoured by the topology in a given
n-node graph more than in another, we adopt the follow-
ing measures of stability. We assume that Λ(ν = 0) > 0,
meaning that the uncoupled systems ˙x = F(x) support
a chaotic dynamics. For ν > 0, the three possible behav-
iors of Λ(ν) sketched in Fig. 1 can be produced, deﬁning
three possible classes for the choice of the functions F(x)
and H(x). For systems in class I, one can never sta-
bilizes synchronization in any graph topology.
In fact,
for any σ and any eigenvalues’ distributions, the prod-
uct σλk always leads to a positive maximum Lyapunov
exponent, and therefore the synchronization manifold S
is always transversally unstable. Class II systems always

given any eigenvalue distributions (any graph topology)
it is suﬃcient to select σ > νc/λ2 (λ2 6= 0 in a connected
graph [15]) to warrant that all transverse directions to S

have associated negative Lyapunov exponents. The syn-
chronous state will be stable for smaller values of σ in
a graph with a larger λ2, so that λ2 can be used as a
measure of the stability of the synchronous state (SSS).
For systems in class III, the stability condition is satisﬁed
when σ > νc1/λ2 and σ < νc2/λN , indicating that the
more packed the eigenvalues of L are, the higher is the
chance of having all Lyapunov exponents into the sta-
bility range [14]. Consequentely, the ratio λ2/λn can be
used as a measure of SSS. Classes II and III include a
large number of functions F , describing several relevant
dynamical systems, as the Lorenz and R¨ossler chaotic
oscillators, and the Chua oscillator. It is important to
notice that not only F , but also H has a role in deter-
mining to which class a speciﬁc dynamical system belongs
to. As an example, a nearest neighbor diﬀusive coupling
on the R¨ossler chaotic system yields a class II (class III)
Master Stability Function, when the function H extracts
the second (the ﬁrst) component of the vector ﬁeld [16].
In Fig. 2 (panel a and b) we report the two indices of
SSS, namely λ2 (class II) and λ2/λ4 (class III), for the
six 4-node undirected motifs. We observe a general in-
crease in the SSS’s as the number of the edges in the
motif increases. Such an increase in SSS is in agreement
with the decrease of the synchronization threshold ob-
served numerically in the Kuramoto model by Moreno et
al.
[17]. The two measures of SSS we propose are also
in good agreement with the natural conservation ratio
(NCR) for the same 4-node motifs in the the yeast pro-
tein interaction network reported in panel c). The NCR
is a measure proposed in Ref.[18] to quantity the conser-
vation of a given motif in the evolution across species, and
is highly correlated to the motif Z-score. The agreement
between SSS and NCR is an indication that motifs dis-
playing an improved stability of cooperative activities (as
synchronous states) are preserved across evolution with

a higher probability.

k + iλI

We now turn our attention to directed motifs. In a
directed graph, the matrix L is asymmetric and in general
not always diagonalizable. Nevertheless, L can be trans-
formed into a Jordan canonical form, and it has been
proven that the same condition valid for diagonalizable
networks (Λ(σλk) < 0 ∀k = 2, ..., n) also applies to non-
diagonalizable networks [19]. In addition, the spectrum
of L is either real or made of pairs of complex conjugates.
Because of the zero row-sum condition, L always admits
λ1 = 0, and the other eigenvalues λk = λR
k, k =
2, . . . , n (having non negative real parts according to the
Gerschgorin’s circle theorem [20]) can be ordered by in-
creasing real part (0 ≤ λR
n ). Consequently,
the parametric equation (6) has to be studied for com-
plex values of the parameter ν = νR + iνI . This yields a
master stability function Λ(ν) as a surface over the com-
plex plane ν, that generalizes the plots for the case ν real
shown in Fig. 1. By calling R the region in the complex
plane where Λ(ν) provides a negative Lyapunov expo-
nent, the stability condition for the synchronous state is
that the set {σλk, k = 2, . . . , n} be entirely contained in
R for a given σ. This is best accomplished for connection
topologies that make λR

systems, and for topologies that simultaneously make λR

compatible with synchronization for any choice of F(x)

we have assumed the case of networked chaotic systems
(Λ(ν = 0) > 0). In fact, λR

oriented spanning tree, (i.e., there is a node from which
all other nodes can be reached by following directed links)
[19, 21] and this condition, that generalizes the notion
of connectedness for undirected graphs [15] to directed
graphs, is not valid in the case of the bifan.

FIG. 3: The SSS of each of the thirteen 3-node directed mo-
tifs is reported (continuous line) for class II (left panels), and
class III systems (right panels). The SSS values are com-
pared with the Z-score (hystograms) and with a measure of
the stability of stationary states (dashed line) from Ref.[11],
in ﬁve diﬀerent biological networks: the transcriptional regu-
latory networks of E. coli (panels a) and S. cerevisiae (panel
b), the developmental transcriptional network of Drosophila
melanogaster (panel c), the signal transduction knowledge en-
vironment (STKE) network (panel d), and the neural connec-
tion map of C. elegans (panel e).

class I and class II systems exhibit an average increase of
SSS as a function of the number of links in the motif. The
SSS show an overall agreement with the Z-score proﬁle in

duce the statistical preponderance of motifs 12, 10 and
9. This might be due to the fact that synchronization
processes are more important in neural systems than in
other biological systems as transcriptional networks, es-
pecially the simplest ones (E. coli and S. cerevisiae). We
have also reported in ﬁgure, as dashed lines, the measure
of the stability of stationary states proposed by Prill et
[11]. Such a measure seems to be better indicated
al.
for those systems where the stability of stationary states
can be a more relevant dynamical quantity to investigate
than the stability of synchronous states.

Finally, we have considered the 199 4-node directed
motifs. Here we report the results for three of the
most statistically relevant motifs found in biological net-
works: the bifan, the biparallel and the feedback loop
(see Ref. [5]). Such three motifs correspond all to cases
in which L can be diagonalized. The biparallel graph,
that is abundant in the C. elegans and in transcrip-
tional networks, has real eigenvalues and a relatively high
value of SSSs: λR

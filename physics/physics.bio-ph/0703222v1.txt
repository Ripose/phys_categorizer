Due to the time-scale limitations of all-atom simulation of proteins, there has been substantial
interest in coarse-grained approaches. Some methods, like “Resolution Exchange,” [E. Lyman et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 028105 (2006)] can accelerate canonical all-atom sampling, but require properly
distributed coarse ensembles. We therefore demonstrate that full sampling can indeed be achieved
in a suﬃciently simpliﬁed protein model, as veriﬁed by a recently developed convergence analysis.
The model accounts for protein backbone geometry in that rigid peptide planes rotate according to
atomistically deﬁned dihedral angles, but there are only two degrees of freedom (φ and ψ dihedrals)
per residue. Our convergence analysis indicates that small proteins (up to 89 residues in our tests)
can be simulated for more than 50 “structural decorrelation times” in less than a week on a single
processor. We show that the ﬂuctuation behavior is reasonable, as well as discussing applications,
limitations, and extensions of the model.

I.

INTRODUCTION

How simpliﬁed must a molecular model of a protein
be for it to allow full canonical sampling? This question
may be important to the solution of the protein sampling
problem—the generation of protein structures properly
distributed according to statistical mechanics—because
of the well-known inadequacy of all-atom simulations,
which are limited to sub-microsecond timescales. Even
small peptides have proven slow to reach convergence1.
Sophisticated atomistic methods, moreover, which often
employ elevated temperatures2,3,4,5,6, have yet to show
they can overcome the remaining gap in timescales7—
which is generally considered to be several orders of mag-
nitude. On the other hand, because of the drastically re-
duced numbers of degrees of freedom and smoother land-
scapes, coarse-grained models (e.g., Refs. 8,9,10,11,12,
13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26) may have the
potential to aid the ultimate solution to the sampling
problem, particularly in light of recently developed al-
gorithms like “Resolution Exchange”27,28 and related
methods29,30,31.

Although the Resolution Exchange approach, in prin-
ciple, can produce properly distributed atomistic ensem-
bles of protein conﬁgurations, it requires full sampling at
the coarse-grained level27,28. While the potential for such
full sampling has been suggested by some studies of fold-
ing and conformational change (e.g., Refs. 26,32), con-

vergence has yet to be carefully quantiﬁed in equilibrium
sampling of folded proteins. How much coarse-graining
really is necessary? What is the precise computational
cost of diﬀerent approaches? This report begins to an-
swer these questions by studying a united-residue model
with realistic backbone geometry.

We will require a quantitative method for assess-
ing sampling. A number of approaches have been
suggested1,33,34,35,36, but we rely on a recently proposed
statistical approach which directly probes the funda-
mental conﬁguration-space distribution1,37. The method
does not require knowledge of important conﬁgurational

proach attempts to answer the most fundamental sta-
tistical question, “What is the minimum time interval
between snapshots so that a set of structures will be-
have as if each member were drawn independently from
the conﬁguration-space distribution exhibited by the full
trajectory?” This interval is termed the structural decor-
relation time τdec, and the goal is to generate simulations
of length tsim ≫ τdec.

In this report, we demonstrate the convergence of the
equilibrium ensemble for several proteins using a fast,
united-residue model employing rigid peptide planes.
The relative motion of the planes is determined by the
atomistic geometry embodied in the φ and ψ dihedral-
angle rotations, as explained below. We believe such re-
alistic backbone geometry will be necessary for success
in Resolution Exchange studies. The use of geometric
look-up tables enables the rapid use of only two degrees
of freedom per residue (φ and ψ), and one interaction
site at the alpha-carbon. The simulations are therefore
extremely fast. G¯o interactions stabilize the native state
while permitting substantial ﬂuctuations in the overall

2

reasonable equilibrium ﬂuctuations, as was shown in an
earlier study26. Given our interest in native-state ﬂuctu-
ations and the lack of a universal coarse-grained model
capable of stabilizing the native state for any protein,
G¯o interactions are a natural choice for enforcing sta-
bility. Further, beyond the reasonable “local” ﬂuctua-
tions shown below, the model also exhibits partial un-
folding events which are expected both theoretically and
experimentally40,41,42.

Because we see the present model as only a ﬁrst step in
the development of better models, it is important that it
easily allows for the addition of chemical detail, such as
Ramachandran propensities which require only the dihe-
dral angles we use explicitly43. Furthermore, with a rigid
peptide plane, the locations of all backbone atoms—and
the beta carbon—are known implicitly. Thus hydrogen-
bonding and hydrophobic interactions15 can be included
in the model with little eﬀort. In other words, the “ex-
tendibility” of the present simple model was a signiﬁcant
factor in its design.

A. Potential energy of model system

The total potential used in the model is given by

U = U nat + U non,

(1)

where U nat is the total energy for native contacts, and
U non is the total energy for non-native contacts.

For the G¯o interactions, all residues that are separated
by a distance less than Rcut in the experimental structure
are given native interaction energies deﬁned by a square
well:

that, in the coarse-grained simulations, only alpha-carbons
are represented, and the only degrees of freedom are φ and
ψ. Other atoms are shown in the ﬁgure only to clarify the
geometry and our assumption of rigid peptide planes.

backbone.

After the model and the simulation approach are ex-
plained, the ﬂuctuations are compared with experimental
data from X-ray temperature factors and the diversity of
NMR structure sets. The simulations are then analyzed
for convergence and timing.

II. COARSE-GRAINED MODEL

The coarse-grained model used for this study was cho-
sen to meet several criteria: (i) the fewest number of
degrees of freedom per residue; (ii) the ability to utilize
lookup tables for enhanced simulation speed; (iii) the sta-
bility of the native state along with the potential for sub-
stantial non-native ﬂuctuations; and, (iv) the ability to
allow the addition of chemical detail, as simply as pos-
sible. Thus, we chose a rigid peptide plane model with
G¯o interactions9,38,39 and sterics based on alpha-carbon
interaction sites as shown in Fig. 1. The use of such a
simple model, we emphasize, is consistent with our goal
of understanding both the potential, and the limitations
of coarse models for statistically valid sampling. Once
we have understood the costs associated with the present
model, we can design more realistic models, as discussed
below. In other words, we made no attempt to design
the most chemically realistic coarse-grained model, al-
though we believe the use of atomistic peptide geometry
is an improvement over a coarse model we considered
previously26.

The rigid peptide planes allows the use of only two de-
grees of freedom per residue, arguably the fewest that one
would consider in such a model. Indeed, this is fewer than
in a freely rotating chain, although admittedly our model
requires somewhat more complex simulation moves, de-
scribed below.

G¯o interactions were used because they simultaneously
stabilize the native state of the protein and also permit

where ρi is the hard-core radius of residue i deﬁned as half
the Cα distance to the nearest non-covalently-bonded
residue, and h determines the strength of the repulsive
interaction.

For this study, parameters were chosen to be similar
to those in Ref. 26, i.e., ǫ = 1.0, h = 0.3, δ = 0.1, and
Rcut = 8.0 ˚A.

B. Monte Carlo simulation

The protein ﬂuctuations were

generated using
Metropolis Monte Carlo44. Trial conﬁgurations were gen-
erated by adding a random Gaussian deviate to the val-
ues of three sequential pairs of backbone torsions (three φ
and three ψ angles). We found that changing six sequen-
tial backbone torsions maximizes the rate of convergence
of the equilibrium ensemble (data not shown). The en-
ergy of the trial conﬁguration was then determined using
Eq. (1), and the conformation was accepted with proba-
bility min(1, e−∆U/kBT ), where ∆U is the total change in
potential energy of the system. The width of the Gaus-
sian distribution for generating random deviates was cho-
sen such that the acceptance ratio was about 40% for all
simulations. The choice of temperature is discussed be-
low.

C. Use of lookup tables

The speed of the coarse-grained simulation was en-
hanced by using lookup tables to avoid unnecessary com-
In general, utilizing lookup tables increases
putation.
memory usage while decreasing the number of computa-
tions. Since memory is inexpensive and can be expanded
easily, utilizing as much memory as possible can be an ef-
fective technique for increasing the speed of simulations.
In our model there are only two degrees of freedom per
residue (φ, ψ), but Cα distances rij must be computed
to determine native and non-native interaction energies
given by Eqs. (2) and (3). All peptide planes are con-
sidered to possess ideal, rigid geometry as determined by
energy minimization of the all-atom OPLS forceﬁeld45
using the tinker simulation package46.

Given a sequence of three residues (alpha carbons),
we employed a lookup table to provide the Cartesian
coordinates of the third residue—starting from the N-
terminus—and its normal vector as a function of φ and
ψ; see Fig. 1. The table values assume that the ﬁrst
residue is at the origin and the second residue is located
on the z-axis. Once the coordinates for the third residue
were determined via the lookup table, the fourth residue
position was determined using the lookup table in con-
junction with a coordinate rotation and shift. Continu-
ing in this fashion, coordinates for the entire protein were
determined.

The resolution of the lookup table is an important con-
sideration, i.e., the number of φ, ψ values for which Carte-

3

sian coordinates are stored. In our simulations, we tried
resolutions as high as 0.1◦ and as low as 1.0◦, and found
no diﬀerence between the results. Thus, all simulation re-
sults presented here use lookup tables with a resolution
of 1.0◦.

D.

Initial protein relaxation

One perhaps unexpected complication of utilizing a
rigid peptide plane model is that great care must be
taken to relax the protein before simulations can be per-
formed. Although initial values of φ, ψ are obtained from
the X-ray or NMR structure, there are slight deviations
from planar/ideal geometry in a real protein. These de-
viations, while small, can accumulate rapidly to become
very large diﬀerences in the Cartesian coordinate posi-
tions of the residues. Thus, the positions of residues near
the beginning of the protein will be nearly correct, while
the residues near the end of the protein will likely have
large errors—compared to the experimental structure be-
ing modeled—which can create severe steric clashes or
even incorrect protein topology. The severity of these
“errors” necessitates the use of a relaxation procedure
to generate a suitable starting structure—i.e., a set of
φ and ψ angles which, with our ideal-geometry peptide
planes, lead to a topologically reasonable and relatively
clash-free structure.

Before we detail our relaxation procedure, we note
that the need for this additional calculation is an arti-
fact of the simplicity of our model which can be over-
come. With the use lookup tables, in fact, it is possible
to include ﬂexible peptide planes without signiﬁcantly
increasing the computational cost of the model. Such
an approach, which does not require initial relaxation, is
currently under investigation with promising preliminary
results (data not shown).

The relaxation procedure employed in the present
study ﬁrst uses the φ, ψ values directly obtained from
the experimental structure. These dihedrals provide the
initial (problematic) structure for a coarse-grained sim-
ulation. Due to the deviations from planarity described
above, the root means-square deviation (RMSD) between
the initial structure we create and the experimental struc-
ture tends to be large (∼ 10 ˚A was not uncommon for the
proteins in this study). To increase the number of native
contacts and reduce the number of steric clashes, we next
performed what we term “RMSD Monte Carlo” to relax
the protein to a low RMSD structure. Trial moves for
RMSD Monte Carlo were created as described above, but
accepted with probability min(1, e−∆(RMSD)/kB TRMSD ),
where kBTRMSD = 10−7 was chosen so that moves to
a higher RMSD were rare. In other words, the energy
function itself was not used in this initial phase.

Since residues near the beginning of the protein have
less error in the starting structure than residues near the
end, we used RMSD Monte Carlo in segments. The ﬁrst
twenty residues were relaxed until the RMSD was con-

stant within a tolerance of 0.0001 ˚A, followed by the ﬁrst
forty, then the ﬁrst sixty and so on until the RMSD of
the entire protein was relaxed. The RMSD Monte Carlo
simulation typically brought the RMSD of the simulated
structure to less than 0.5 ˚A, however, there were gen-
erally still steric clashes, and some native contacts were
still not present.

The ﬁnal stage of relaxation was to do regular (i.e.,
using energy) Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation, with
a very low temperature.

Relaxation was performed until four criteria were met:
(i) the number of native contacts in the relaxed structure
was equal to that in the NMR or X-ray structure; (ii) no
steric clashes were present; (iii) no non-native contacts
were present, i.e., U non = 0 in Eq. (3), and; (iv) the
RMSD was less than 1.0 ˚A. When these criteria were
met the structure was saved and used as the starting
conﬁguration in all future simulations of the protein.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Using the coarse-grained protein model described
above, we generated and tested equilibrium ensembles
for three proteins: barstar (PDB entry 1A19, residues
1-89), the N-terminal domain of calmodulin (PDB entry
1CLL, residues 4-75), and the binding domain of protein
G (PDB entry 1PGB, residues 1-56)

For each protein, the initial simulation structure was
generated, followed by RMSD and energy relaxation, as
described in Sec. II D. Then, production runs of 2 × 109
Monte Carlo moves were performed with snapshots saved
every 1000 moves, generating an equilibrium ensemble
with 2 × 106 frames.

In an attempt to obtain consistent results for the three
proteins, we chose the temperature of the simulation,
kBT , to be slightly below the unfolding temperature of
the protein. The unfolding temperature was determined
by running simulations over a broad range of tempera-
tures and studying the RMSD as a function of simulation
time. The temperatures used in the simulations were
kBT = 0.6 for barstar, kBT = 0.4 for calmodulin and
kBT = 0.5 for protein G.

A. Speed of simulations

Due to the use of lookup tables for coordinate trans-
formations, the small number of degrees of freedom, and
utilizing simple square potentials, the equilibrium ensem-
bles were generated very rapidly.

Running on one Xeon 2.4 GHz processor, 2×109 Monte
Carlo moves with snapshots saved every 1000 steps took
roughly 6 days for barstar, 4 days for calmodulin, and 3
days for protein G. Thus, less than a week was required
to obtain well-converged (see Sec. III C) simulations of
these coarse-grained proteins.

B. Protein ﬂuctuations

We ﬁrst sought to determine whether ﬂuctuations in
the coarse-grained simulation are reasonable. Figure 2
shows the alpha-carbon relative root mean square ﬂuc-
tuation for three diﬀerent proteins. The ﬁgures show
that there is reasonable qualitative agreement between
the NMR, X-ray and simulation data.

It should be noted that, in fact, none of the three data
sets in Figs. 2a, b and c represents the true ﬂuctuations
in the protein—for diﬀerent reasons. The X-ray temper-
ature factor, in addition to thermal ﬂuctuations, includes
crystal lattice artifacts and other experimental errors48.
NMR ensembles tend to be biased, perhaps severely, to-
ward low energy structures, and thus also do not rep-
resent equilibrium ensembles49. Finally, our simulation
data is not accurate due to the lack of chemical detail in
the forceﬁeld.

In spite of the limitations of the analysis, we conclude
from Fig. 2 that the ﬂuctuations of the coarse-grained
model are in fact reasonable.

The bottom panels of Fig. 2 show the whole-molecule
ﬂuctuations exhibited throughout the trajectories.
In
addition to the ability to sample large conformational
ﬂuctuations—such as in the case of calmodulin and, to a
lesser degree, for protein G—the trajectories are visibly
more converged than is typically observed in atomistic
simulations, where RMSD values rarely reach a plateau
value, let alone sampling around that plateau value mul-
tiple times as would be desirable.

C. Convergence analysis

The primary purpose of this report is to demonstrate
the convergence of the equilibrium ensemble for a coarse-
grained protein. The details of the convergence analysis
are described in Ref. 37, so we will only brieﬂy describe
the method here.

Previously, Lyman and Zuckerman1 developed an ap-
proach which groups sampled conformations into struc-
tural histogram bins, using the RMSD as a metric. While
promising, the primary limitation of the method was the
lack of a quantitative measure of the convergence.

In the method used here, convergence was analyzed
by studying the variance of the structural histogram
bin populations37. The new approach allows a rigor-
ous quantitative estimation of convergence—the struc-
tural decorrelation time τdec, given by the time between
frames required for the variance to reach an analytically
computable independent-sampling value. Intuitively, and
mathematically, τdec is the time interval between snap-
shots for which they behave as if each frame were drawn
If simulation times tsim ≫ τdec are ob-
independently.
tained, the equilibrium ensemble is considered converged.
Perhaps the most important feature of the convergence
analysis for our study is that the method does not require
any prior knowledge of important states. Furthermore,

coarse-grained simulation (solid). X-ray results were given by p3B/8π2, where B is the temperature factor given in the PDB
entry. NMR and simulation data were generated using the g rmsf program in the gromacs molecular simulation package47;
each ensemble was aligned to the ﬁrst structure in the corresponding trajectory. For each coarse-grained simulation, 2 × 109
Monte Carlo steps were performed with snapshots saved every 1000 steps, and the potential energy (1) was set up using the
X-ray structure. Panels (d) - (f) show the corresponding whole-structure ﬂuctuations as indicated by the RMSD from the
experimental structures.

there is no parameter-ﬁtting or subjective analysis of any
kind.

Figure 3 shows the convergence properties of the
coarse-grained simulations using the same trajectories as
in Fig. 2. The ratio of the observed variance to the ideal
variance for independent sampling is plotted as a function
of the time between the conﬁgurations used to compute
the observed variance. When this ratio decreases to one
the structural decorrelation time τdec has been reached,
as shown in the ﬁgure. The analysis predicts that each
simulation is at least 50 times longer than the structural
decorrelation time.

Thus we conclude that, in less than a week of single-
processor time, the equilibrium ensembles for these three
proteins are well converged.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have demonstrated the convergence of the equilib-
rium ensemble for a simple united-residue protein model.
The model assumes rigid peptide planes, with atomisti-
cally correct geometry, and exhibits reasonable residue-
level ﬂuctuations based the planes’ geometry, G¯o inter-
actions, and sterics.

Most importantly, the results indicate quantitatively
that carefully designed united-residue models have the
potential to fully sample protein ﬂuctuations. By us-
ing only two degrees of freedom per residue, look up ta-
bles for coordinate transforms, and simple square well
potentials, we were able to demonstrate that converged
equilibrium ensembles can be obtained in less than a
week of single processor time. The quantitative conver-
gence analysis indicates that more than 50 “decorrela-
tion times” were simulated in each case, indicating high-
precision ensembles. In addition to application in Reso-
lution Exchange sampling of all-atom models27,28, such
speed opens up the long-term possibility of large-scale
simulation of many proteins.

FIG. 3: Convergence analysis for coarse-grained simulations of three diﬀerent proteins: (a) barstar, (b) calmodulin, and (c)
protein G. Each plot shows the convergence properties for the same trajectories as used for Fig. 2, analyzed using the procedure
in Ref. 37. The number of frames required to reach the value of one (the solid horizontal line) is an approximation of the
structural decorrelation time τdec and is shown on each plot. The three curves on each plot are results for diﬀerent histogram
sub-sample sizes37 and demonstrates the robustness of the value of τdec. The plots predict that the decorrelation times are
roughly 40 000 frames for barstar, 20 000 frames for calmodulin and 30 000 frames for protein G. Note that the total number
of frames generated for each protein during the simulation was 2 × 106. Thus, since each simulation was more than 50τdec in
length, we conclude that the equilibrium ensembles are well-converged. Error bars represent 80% conﬁdence intervals in the
expected ﬂuctuations around the ideal value of one, based on the given trajectory length and the numerical procedure used to
generate the solid curve.

bles in such a short time, it is clear we can “aﬀord” exten-
sions to the model which include realistic chemistry. For
instance, additional potential energy terms such as Ra-
machandran propensities43, hydrophobic interactions15
and hydrogen-bonding can be included at small cost.

for

Aside from the potential

rigorous atomistic
sampling27,28,50, it is important to note the general use-
fulness of coarse-grained models for generating ad hoc
atomistic ensembles. Speciﬁcally, upon generating a well-
sampled ensemble of coarse-grained structures, atomic
detail can be added using existing software such as those
in Refs. 51,52. Once minimized and relaxed, these (now)
atomically detailed structures form an ad hoc ensem-
ble which may be of immediate use in docking53,54 and
homology modeling applications. Further, in principle,
such structures can be re-weighted into the Boltzmann
distribution50.

In the long term, one can imagine a day when struc-
tural databases will be based not on single (static)
structures but rather will collect ensembles—as envi-
sioned in the authors’ scheme for an “Ensemble Protein
Database”(http://www.epdb.pitt.edu/).

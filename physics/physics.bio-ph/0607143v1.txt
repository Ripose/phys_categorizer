From the crystal structure data and using the concept of equilbrium statistical mechanics we
show how to calculate the thermodynamics of protein/DNA complexes. We apply the method to
the TATA-box binding protein (TBP)/TATA sequence complex. We have estimated the change in
free energy and entropy for each of the base pair (bp). The local rigidity of the DNA is estimated
from the curvature of the free energy. We also estimate the free energy gain of the protein due to
bond formation with a particular bp. We thus ﬁgure out the bps responsible for speciﬁc binding.

All the cellular processes in life are controlled by two
biopolymers, namely, protein and nucleic acid along with
many smaller molecules like lipid, carbohydrate, wa-
ter etc. via their speciﬁc and non-speciﬁc interactions.
The aminoacids form the primary structure of a pro-
tein molecule[1]. On the other hand, the strutural unit
of an antiparallel double helical deoxiribo nucleic acid
(DNA) molecule[1, 2], as shown in Fig. 1(a), is the nu-
cleotides consisting of 5-carbon neutral sugar (deoxyri-
bose), nitrogen-containing purine (adenine, A and gua-
nine, G) or pyriminine (thymine, T and cytosine, C) hy-
drophobic bases attached to the sugar, the former in turn
attached to a negatively charged phosphate group. The
Watson-Crick base pairs (bp), namely A with T and G
with C, remain at the core of the double helix with strong
inter-basepair stacking, while the phosphates line up the
periphery. Functional groups of the bases (amino, imino
or keto) capable to form hydrogen bonds (H-bond) with
functionally important protein molecules, are exposed to-
wards the solvent within the two grooves: major or minor
as shown in Fig. 1(b).

The protein synthesis in an organism is controlled via
gene expression[1]. It consists of two parts: (i) transcrip-
tion, the synthesis of ribo nucleic acid (RNA) from DNA

and (ii) translation, the synthesis of protein from RNA.
For initiation of transcription, a transcription factor com-
prising a class of protein including RNA polymerase
needs to bind to the speciﬁc site of DNA (promoter) that
encodes for the given protein (gene). Obviously, one ma-
jor thrust in biochemical research aims at understanding
protein/DNA interaction. Some of the issues of immense
biochemical importance are: (i)Energetics involved in the
complex formation; (ii) time scale related to diﬀerent de-
grees of freedom of DNA bp in the complex formation;
(iii) kinetics of binding. Apart from pedagogical interest,
these issues are extremly important application in drug
designing, macromolecule recognition etc.

In this paper we show how the x-ray crystal structure
data can be utilized to understand the thermodynamics
of protein/DNA complex at the level of bp, using the
fundamental concepts of equilbrium statistical mechan-
ics. We have build up from the crystallographic data
both for complexed and the free state, the free-energy of
deformation in six degrees of freedom of a bp in a given
DNA sequence, treating the bp as a rigid plane. We can
thus estimate the change in free energy δF α
DN A of the α-
th bp upon the complex formation. We further identify
from the crystallographic data the H-bonded atoms of a
given protein residue with the given bp and estimate the
energy of binding which is essentially the free energy gain
δF α
complex upon complexation, if the complex formation is
energy dominated, especially at low temperatures. One
can thereby estimate the free energy gain of the protein,
δF α
prot upon complexation at the α-th bp by accounting
for the accompanied ion and water release. δF α
DN A sheds
some light on the time scale of DNA bp dynamics within
the elastic approximation. We apply this analysis to the
particular complex of TBP/TATA sequence DNA. The
TBP/TATA box complex is one of the most important
and well studied protein/DNA complex [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
Crystal structures of TBP/TATA box show that TBP
binds through minor groove to severly deformed[8] con-
sensus TATA sequence, namely, TATA(T/A)A(T/A)N,
where the bases in one of the strands have been indicated,
(T/A) being either thymine or adenine and N any of the

four bases. The functional groups in the minor groove
are incapable to provide enough discriminatory H-bond
partners to TBP for speciﬁc binding. An indirect mode
of recognition has been proposed to explain TBP/TATA
sequence speciﬁc binding. Here the DNA becomes struc-
turally rigid in severely deformed conformation that al-
lows the TBP to form adequate H-bonds. However, it
has been found from the previous bioinformatics study
that DNA becomes more ﬂexible upon protein binding
[9]. Our analysis on TBP/TATA box complex sheds some
light on this speciﬁc binding mode which is of profound
biological interest.

We have taken structures of the available TBP/TATA-
sequence complexes solved by x-ray crystallography at
a resolution better than 2.5A0 from the Protein Data
Bank (PDB)[10] [11]. The temperature of the selected
complexes is in the range 100 − 120K and the pH ranges
within 6.5 − 7.0. We have taken all such TBP/TATA
sequence complexes as independent data set. For all the
selected complexes TBP binds to a ten bp highly con-
served (> 90%) DNA CTATAAAAGG sequence in one
strand (5′ to 3′) along with the normal Watson-Crick
base pairing in the opposite strand. We have taken two
consecutive bps in 5′ to 3′ direction and construct a mean
axis system with respect to which the bp geometrical pa-
rameters are deﬁned[12]. We deﬁne base normal, ~Nα, as
the vector normal to mean bp plane deﬁned by all ring
atoms of the α-th base, obtained from the coordinate of
diﬀerent atoms listed in the PDB ﬁles. We further take
the bp normal, ~Zα, as the mean of ~Nα of two paired
bases, normalized to unit vector. The bp long axis, ~Yα,
is the vector along the line joining C1′ atoms of the bps,
as shown in Fig. 1(b). The bp short axis, ~Xα is the vec-
tor normal to both ~Yα and ~Zα and pointing towards the
major groove side of the bp. The base-base vector, ~M , is
the vector joining the centers of two consecutive bps and
mean doublet z-axis, ~Zm = ( ~X1+ ~X2)×(~Y1+~Y2)
. The bp pa-
| ~X1+ ~X2|.|~Y1+~Y2|
rameters have been calculated using the relations: Tilt,
τ = − sin−1( ~Zm. ~X1); roll, ρ = sin−1( ~Zm.~Y1); twist, ω =
cos−1[( ~X1 × ~Zm).( ~X2 × ~Zm)]; Shift, Dx = ~M . ( ~X1+ ~X2)
;
| ~X1+ ~X2|
Slide, Dy = ~M . (~Y1+~Y2)

and Rise, Dz = ~M . ~Zm.

We generate histogram for each of the local parame-
ters of the TATA sequence DNA complexed with TBP.
Fig.2(a) shows typical histogram P (ρ) for ρ. There are
three distinct sets of histogram: Set I shows the data for
the ﬁrst bp, set II shows data for the ﬁfth bp and set III
shows that for the second bp. In set I, the mean value
of ρ lies within the range 0◦ − 4◦ which is similar to that
known in the free case[13]. So bps in set I has almost no
roll deformation due to complexation. On the other hand
in set III, where the mean value of ρ is within 48◦ − 52◦,
exhibits the maximum deformation due to complexation.
The mean value of ρ in set II lies within 20◦ − 24◦. Fig.
2(b) shows the histograms, P (ω) for ω. Here the mean

FIG. 2: (color online) (a) P(ρ)vs.ρ: Set I for the ﬁrst base
pair (fourth and ninth bp being similar). Set II for sixth bp
steps (ﬁfth and seventh being similar) and Set III for second
bp steps (third, eighth bp similar trend). (b) P(ω)vs.ω: Set
I for second and sixth base pair step (ﬁfth, seventh bp being
similar). Set II for ﬁrst base pair step (third, fourth, eighth
and nineth bp being similar).

value of ω for the ﬁrst bp is ∼ 36◦, comparable to mean ω
in the free case[13]. The mean value of ω corresponding to
the second and the sixth bp are 15◦ and 18◦ respectively,
exhibiting large deformation in ω. The histogram for the
τ corresponding to all bp have the mean values similar to
the known tilt value in free case (0.0◦ ± 0.5◦)[13], having
insigniﬁcant eﬀect of complexation.

We further ﬁnd the atoms of the protein residues form-
ing H-bonds to the bases in a given bp along with the
sugar ring and the phosphate groups attached onto it.
Here H-bond analysis has been done with the help of
pyrHBﬁnd software[14]. The binding region is primarily
located between the fourth and the seventh bp. There
are direct H-bonding at the ﬁfth and the sixth bp be-
tween base and amino acid residues, asparagine and tryp-
tophan. Fig. 3(a) shows the probability P α
H of ﬁnding H-
bonds through sugar, phosphate and base in the vicinity
of the α-th bp. Maximum number of H-bonding, three
with the bases, two with the phosphate oxygen and one
with the sugar, is observed at the vicinity of ﬁfth bp.
There is a substantial number of H-bonding through the
sixth bp as well. Binding through sugar dominate the
between ﬁfth to seventh bp, the maximum being at the

sixth bp. The correlation between the deformation of
DNA and the binding pattern is better revealed from the
inset of Fig. 3(a), where the H-bonding energy Eα
b [15] be-
tween the bound part of the bp and the protein residue,
is plotted against bp. We ﬁnd that the classical electro-
static part has dominant contribution to Eα
in all the
b
cases. Eα
b has a funnel structure between the third and
the seventh bps, having a minimum ∼ −30 kcal/mole at
the ﬁfth bp. At the seventh bp, where protein residues do
not directly interact with the base but interact with the
b is relatively small, ∼ −13 kcal/mole. Sim-
backbone, Eα
ilarly, at the second and the nineth bp where the phos-
phate oxygen interacts with polar amino acid residues Eα
b
is ∼ −12 kcal/mole. Thus the base binding contributes
an energy ∼ −15 kcal/mole at the ﬁfth and the sixth bps.
This additional energy can be deﬁned as that due to the
speciﬁcity of the base binding, the speciﬁcity being larger
at the ﬁfth bp. Note that the binding process makes the
bps energetically inhomogeneous which is particularly re-
markable for the ﬁfth, sixth and the seventh bp, each of
them being A. The Eα
b data corroborates to the defor-
mation data in Figs 2(a) and (b), namely, the P (ρ) and
the P (ω) data group together for the bps in the region
of stronger binding. P (ρ) and P (ω) for the second and
the eighth bp are distinct from the others, despite having
relatively weaker Eα
b has weak local minima at these
bps. This indicate that the protein binding may initiate
at these two metastable points, having strong mechanical
deformation.

b . Eα

i = −ln[P α

We calculate the free energy of deformation per com-
plex at the α-th bp, βF α
i ], where i denotes
any of the six bp parameter, β = 1/kBT , kB being the
Boltzmann constant and T the temperature. Fig. 3(b)
shows βF α(ρ) for roll of the ﬁfth, sixth and the seventh
bp. βF α(ρ) has a minimum having a fair degree of har-
monicity, typical for an elastic degree of freedom[16], with
deviations only for ρ values far away from the minimum.
We ﬁnd similar trend in all other free energy proﬁles. The
curvature of the free energy at the minimum is a measure
of the local rigidity corresponding to the bp parameter.
The inset of Fig. 3(b) shows the curvature at diﬀerent
bp for the rotational parameters, Cα
i , (i = ρ, τ, ω). The
Cα
i data show large local rigidity for the bp with large
Eα
b . One can estimate the frequency of small oscillations
about the equilibirum from the curvature data by having
the moment of inertia of a bp with respect to the rele-
vant axis of rotation. The time period corresponding to
the rotational parmeter ranges between 30-50 ps which
is comparable to solvation time scale of water molecules
in the vicinity of protein/DNA complex[17].

DN A and δF α

We also estimate δF α

prot. To this end we
selected the ﬁfth and the sixth bp, where the base binding
gives speciﬁc stability to the complex. We compare the
results to these of the seventh bp, having no H-bonding
with base and the free AA bp doublet[18]. Fig. 3(b)
shows the free energy for the free case as well. The sec-

DN A = Pi δF α

ond column of Table 1 shows that the change in curva-
ture, in ρ, compared to the free case, is largest at the
ﬁfth bp. The diﬀerence in free energy minima between
DN A,i for αth bp
the complex and the free case gives δF α
parameter so that δF α
DN A,i. The third col-
umn of Table I shows δF α
DN A for α = 5, 6 and 7. We
ﬁnd that δF α
DN A < 0 for all α, indicating that after com-
plexation the DNA goes to a thermodynamically more
favoured state. The fourth column of Table I shows the
loss of entropy of DNA estimated within the harmonic
approximation. The α dependence in the entropy loss in-
dicates that diﬀerent amount of heat generated as the H-
bonds are formed at diﬀerent bp in the complex. The free
energy gain upon complexation at the α-th bp is given
by: δF α
ion, where
δF α
ion are the free energy cost for water and
ion released respectively upon bond formation at the α-th
bp. We take for low temperature δF α
b , ignoring
the entropy eﬀects due to the bond vibrations. However,
the water and the ion releases are entropy driven pro-
cesses. When TBP binds to the TATA sequence 19 wa-

ter molecules are released from the interfacial sufrace[19].
We ﬁnd that seven phosphate groups in the TATA se-
quence are neutralized by seven positively charged amino
acid residues. So we expect that upon complex forma-
tion on an average 14 ions are released from the inter-
fecial suface. The entropy gain (≃ δF α
ion) due
to the displaced ions and water molecules is estimated to
be ∼ 38.29kBT [21]. Thus δF α
prot can be estimated and
shown in the last column of Table I where we observe
that the free energy gain by the protein is maximum at
the ﬁfth bp. We thus ﬁnd that the change in curvature
and the maximum gain in thermodynamic free energy of
diﬀerent components in the TBP/TATA sequence com-
plex are strongly correlated. The metastable complex
through binding at the second and the eighth bp is sta-
bilized by enhanced base binding at locally more rigid
ﬁfth bp. This mechanism holds the key to the indirect
recognition of the TBP/TATA sequence complex. Earlier
attempt [9] might have missed enhanced local rigidity by
taking average over all protein/DNA complexes.

In summary we show here an approach based on
the equilibrium statistical mechanics how crystal stru-
crure data is used to obtain the bp-wise stability of a
protein/DNA complex. Our analysis shows that the
maximum speciﬁcity of the TBP/TATA sequence com-
plex comes from H-bonding with the ﬁfth bp where the
changes in the rigidity are the maximum, though the
binding may proceed from the second and the eigthth
bp. Even though our analysis has been in the crytal
phase, recent studies indicate that the enzymatic prop-
erties of protein and nucleic acids remain intact in the
crystal phase[20]. Hence, our predictions should hold
even for TBP/TATA complex in the solution phase, per-
tinent to the in-vivo situations. Our predictions may be
veriﬁed by single molecule experiments where the H-bond
forming abilty of diﬀerent bp of the TATA-box sequence
can be selectively altered by thio-substitution. We would
point out that our analysis is quite general and can be

applied to any protein/Nucleic acid complex. We shall
report such detailed analysis in future publications.

In this paper we present the results of a large-scale numerical in-
vestigation of structural properties of a model of cell membrane, sim-
ulated as a bilayer of ﬂexible molecules in vacuum. The study was
performed by carrying out extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations,
in the (N V E) micro-canonical ensemble, of two systems of diﬀerent
256 molecules), over a fairly large set of tem-
sizes (2
peratures and densities, using parallel platforms and more standard
serial computers. Depending on the dimension of the system, the dy-
namics was followed for physical times that go from few hundred of
picoseconds for the largest system to 5–10 nanoseconds for the small-
est one. We ﬁnd that the bilayer remains stable even in the absence
of water and neglecting Coulomb interactions in the whole range of
temperatures and densities we have investigated. The extension of
the region of physical parameters that we have explored has allowed
us to study signiﬁcant points in the phase diagram of the bilayer and
to expose marked structural changes as density and temperature are
varied, which are interpreted as the system passing from a crystal to
a gel phase.

1 Introduction

The simulation of realistic models of cell membranes is of the utmost importance,
if not for immediate medical use, certainly for the development of new conceptual
and practical tools in the application of Molecular Dynamics (MD) methods to
these and similarly complex systems. A lot of research activity has gone in this
direction (see for instance [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and references therein), but we are still
far from having a complete understanding of the dynamic and thermodynamic
properties of this kind of systems, not to mention the problem of simulating the
formation and the dynamics of pores and ion channels (see, however, the recent
very interesting work of ref. [7]).

To predict the structure of molecular layers in diﬀerent physico-chemical con-
ditions by computer simulations, several modeling strategies have been proposed
and investigated. Among them we would like to mention the following.

1) Atomistic detailed approaches in which bilayer constituent molecules, water
and possible counter-ions are modeled explicitly in full detail. The interaction be-
tween electrostatic point charges are evaluated through Ewald related summation
techniques, while the bias due to the use of periodic boundary conditions is re-
duced by performing simulations in extended ensembles. Recent examples of this

2

kind of investigations can be found in refs. [3, 4, 8].

2) Simpliﬁed models of structures formed by surfactants have been constructed
that retain some of the essential interactions between the constituent particles, like
the Lennard-Jones (LJ) forces among the hydrophobic tails and between solvent
and hydrophilic molecular heads. On top of them an ad hoc repulsive soft core
describing the interaction between hydrophobic and hydrophilic particles is added
to allow self-assembling of micelles and bilayers [9].

3) Models in which only a single molecule or chain is modeled explicitly in
terms of a realistic all-atom description, while the eﬀect of the remainder of the
system is parametrized by a mean-ﬁeld deterministic force plus appropriate random
forces. Models of this type are successfully treated by Monte Carlo simulations
In this context we wish to recall the fairly good
and/or stochastic techniques.
agreement with experiments obtained in the evaluation of the NMR deuterium
order parameters in the case of lipid bilayers, when Brownian Dynamics is used
for their simulations [10].

4) In the ﬁeld of liquid crystals, where certain properties of layers often can be
explored only through computer simulations, even more simpliﬁed force-ﬁelds, like
that proposed by Gay and Berne [11] (GB hereafter) with the successive modiﬁ-
cations of refs. [12] and [13], are used. Despite their simplicity these models allow
the exploration and the study of various phases of the system, including smectic
phases characterized by a number of diﬀerent tilt angles.

Comparing diﬀerent models and trying to assess the eﬀects of the various
contributions that are included or neglected in diﬀerent instances, is not a simple
task. An example of this situation is the comparison between the GB potential [11]
and its closest LJ representation. The GB potential was originally devised so as
to mimic the interaction between two identical linear arrays composed by four
LJ sites each. The properties of a ﬂuid made of GB particles turn out to be
rather diﬀerent from its LJ counterpart: the GB ﬂuid has a phase diagram with
a well characterized nematic-isotropic transition temperature, while apparently
the LJ counterpart does not show any phase transition of this kind when only
the temperature is varied. This is a case where the use of a simpliﬁed potential,
far from leading to an impoverishment of the model, turns out to give rise to an
unexpected and very interesting thermodynamic behaviour.

In the case of lipid molecules the comparison among diﬀerent modeling strate-
gies are much more diﬃcult because of the occurrence of diﬀerent types of in-
teraction sites (head, tail and solvent) and because of the special importance of
the internal molecular degrees of freedom, that may greatly inﬂuence the inter-
molecular interactions, as well as the related hydrophobic tail packing and bilayer
stability properties.

The purpose of this paper is to perform MD simulations of a simpliﬁed, but still

3

suﬃciently rich model of molecular bilayer in vacuum. The bilayer constituents
are branched molecules composed by LJ sites with the topology and the inter-
nal ﬂexibility of the two fatty acid tails and glycerol group of the Dimyristoyl-
phosphatidylcholine (DMPC hereafter) molecule.
In the absence of water, the
charged part of the DMPC head has been replaced by a methyl group (see Fig. 1).

way.

With respect to an all-atom description of DMPC bilayers [6], we retain in
the model only the LJ interactions between the most hydrophobic portions of
the lipid molecules together their intra-molecular ﬂexibility. These simpliﬁcations
allow us to single out and investigate the role of repulsive-dispersive interactions in

4

the structure of the bilayer, without the complications arising when electrostatic
interactions among heads and solvent are present, which substantially limit the
length of the simulated trajectories.

∼

Owing to these circumstances we are able to generate very long trajectories
(up to
10 ns) of suﬃciently large systems, which allow us not only to expose
and control certain eﬀects related to the slow equilibration of the system (which
would be important sources of systematic errors in the analysis of simulations not
suﬃciently longer than 1 ns), but also to accurately check the physical consistency
of the parameters of the employed intra-molecular potential.

We notice that in the simpliﬁed approach we present in this paper the bilayer
components are not really amphiphilic. This is not, however, a completely silly
approximation. We have checked, in fact, that the system conﬁgurations, occurring
at the lowest density we have explored, in which it happens that some of the
molecule tails are turned up-side-down, have approximately the same potential
energy as the physical situation in which the tails of the molecules of the two
layers are in contact. We ﬁnd instead that at the surface density of both the
crystal and gel phases the energy barrier which should be overcome by a molecule
to rotate up-side-down by 180◦ degrees is suﬃciently high to prevent this event
to occur in the whole range of temperatures we have explored. This observation
makes us conﬁdent that the predictions we have for the structural properties of
the system in these two phases are fully reliable. As we said the situation, is
completely diﬀerent at our lowest density, which corresponds to that of the liquid-
crystal phase. Evidently in this case the potential barrier is not suﬃciently high,
as we witness the crossing of it by some of the molecules. Despite this unphysical
feature, we remark that our bilayer model remains stable at all the values of
temperature and density we have studied (even at the lowest one), in the sense
that, thanks to the strong attractive interactions between the two layers, none of
the molecules leaves the layers.

We also notice that at low surface density the potential energy of the whole
system is presumably smaller than it would be if the repulsion between solvent and
tails were introduced. In models in which solvatation eﬀects are included [8, 9] low
density conﬁgurations are essentially inaccessible, precisely because of a substantial
solvent-tail repulsion.

Given the crudeness of our bilayer model, we do not expect to be able to
accurately predict thermodynamic parameters, like the dependence of the surface
density or the magnitude of the stress tensor [4, 8] as functions of the temperature,
mainly because of the lack of the interactions that govern the structure of the
solvent interface and the absence of terms in the force-ﬁeld that would prevent the
tendency to isotropization at much too low surface densities we have mentioned
above. Therefore, in order to study the physics of the diﬀerent phases of our bilayer

5

model, we decided to ﬁx the surface density at the experimentally estimated values
(N V E-simulations), rather than trying to work in an extended ensemble at ﬁxed
(lateral) pressure.

As for the role of water, we tentatively assume that, once the bilayer is formed
in the polar ﬂuid, its structural and thermodynamic behaviour will be mainly
governed by the packing and ﬂexibility properties of the hydrocarbon tails [14].
Most of the eﬀects of water on the detailed physico-chemical behaviour of the
membrane are indeed of secondary importance for the kind of questions we are
addressing here. In the picture we have in mind, in fact, water is only important in
that it behaves as a sticky medium for the lipid heads, which modulates the surface
density by more or less penetrating into the bilayer [15]. Thus water penetration
is held responsible for the diﬀerence one sees in the increase of disorder in the head
region, as compared to what happens to the tails, only to the extent it aﬀects the
surface density of the bilayer. The diﬀerent behaviour between heads and tails
may in turn be at the origin of the great sensitivity of the structure of the phase
diagram to molecular composition and tail length.

Even in the simpliﬁed model we are considering here, the known crystal struc-
ture of the glycerol group and fatty acid tails of DMPC [16] is well accommodated
in a local minimum of the force-ﬁeld we are using, at the appropriate surface den-
sity. The comparison of our results with those of more reﬁned models can be of
great help in understanding the relevance of more realistic modelizations of the
molecular components of the system and/or the role of water.

The MD simulations we have performed extend over a rather ﬁne grid in the
temperature-density plane. Thanks to this resolution and to the large statistics
we have collected, we are able to draw interesting conclusions on the role of LJ
interactions and internal ﬂexibility on the stability and the structural properties
of the crystal and gel phases of our bilayer model.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we describe the model of bilayer
we have constructed and investigated. In section 3 we discuss the details of our
simulation strategy and in section 4 we report the most signiﬁcant results we have
obtained with a special emphasis on the information we have collected concerning
structure and properties of the crystal and gel phases of the system. Conclusions
can be found in section 5.

2 Simulation set-up

Schematically, a cell membrane can be described as an almost spherical bilayer
consisting of phospho-lipid molecules which separates the interior of the cell from
the external world. Phospho-lipids are molecules composed by a hydrophilic head

6

and one or two hydrophobic tails. These peculiar hydropathicity properties lead
to the well known two-sheet structure of the membrane, in which the hydrophilic
heads are in contact with water, present both outside and inside the cell, while the
hydrophobic tails are more or less tail-to-tail pair-wise aligned.

It appears experimentally that an important parameter governing the reaction
rate of many biological processes, taking place inside or in the near vicinity of a
membrane, is its “permeability” [14]. From this point of view a membrane can be
thought as a system made out of two layers of a smectic ﬂuid, with a permeability
which depends “critically” on temperature, density, the detailed chemical compo-
sition of the constituent phospho-lipids, the concentration of chemicals possibly
dispersed in the membrane itself or in the solvent, etc.

It is clear that a detailed simulation of the dynamics of the membrane of a
living cell is just impossible and one has to resort to a number of simpliﬁcations.
A fortunate circumstance in this respect is that it appears experimentally that
the nature and the location of the phase transitions, which control a number of
important physico-chemical properties of the membrane, are essentially related to
the bulk ordering properties of the hydrophobic tails [14]. Thus a ﬁrst step in the
direction of simulating a realistic system, and the one which has been also largely
followed in the literature [1, 2, 4, 6], is to take a two sheet system, each consisting
of the largest possible number of lipid molecules (compatibly with the available
computer power), in presence or even in absence of water, and proceed to study
how the relevant order parameters behave as functions of temperature and surface
density and what are the structural properties of the system in the diﬀerent regions
of its phase diagram.

Lacking any realistic theoretical modeling of mesoscopic systems, as membrane
or other molecular aggregates of biological relevance, one must resort to numerical
methods, like MD or Monte Carlo and stochastic simulations of various kinds,
in order to study the dynamic and thermodynamic behaviour of such complex
systems.

MD provides us with a microscopic, most often, classical 1 description of the
system, which consists in following its time evolution by solving numerically the
Newton equations of motion of its elementary constituents.

The general mathematical setting of MD for the simulation of diﬀusive systems
is well known [18] and we will not dwell on it here. For a general presentation of
the method with a discussion of some of the tricks that have been developed to
eﬃciently implement MD codes on the existing most powerful parallel platforms
in the case of (N V E) simulations, we refer the reader to [19].

We have prepared two chemically identical samples of largely diﬀerent size

256 molecules, hereafter de-
of our bilayer model, consisting of 2
noted for short BM (S) and BM (L) (“S” and “L” stand for “small” and “large”,
respectively). Since, as we said in the Introduction, we do not have explicitly
water in our simulations, we will neglect electrostatic interactions altogether. For
consistency we have taken, as a model for the constituent molecules, an artiﬁ-
cial variant of DMPC, christened by us DMMG (Dimyristoyl-methyl-glycerol), in
which the charged part of the DMPC head (deﬁned as the part of the molecule
above the ﬁrst atom–a P atom–bound to the glycerol oxygen) has been replaced
by a single CH3 group. The detailed chemical structure of the Y-shaped DMPC
molecule is shown in Fig. 1, where we have also indicated the modiﬁcation we
have made on its structure in order to construct the artiﬁcial variant of it we
will be dealing with in this paper. The elementary constituents of the DMMG
molecule will be schematically represented by LJ sites centered on the CHn groups
(n = 1, 2, 3), thereby using the so-called “united atom” approximation.
In this
way each DMMG molecule will consist of 37 elementary units (for short simply
“atoms” in the following). Intra-molecular and fully ﬂexible inter-molecular inter-
actions are described by making reference to the OPLS force ﬁeld [20] with the
modiﬁcations introduced in ref. [21]. According to the general OPLS philosophy,
we have reduced the strength of the 1-4 LJ potential in each dihedral angle by a
factor 8. The inter-molecular potential was linearly switched oﬀ between 1.0 and
1.1 nm. As we already said, no electric charges are attributed to atoms.

We have assumed the crystallographic density of our artiﬁcial system, ρ◦, to
be the same as that of DMPC [16]. Experimentally the DMPC crystallographic
surface density corresponds to an area of 0.396 nm2 per molecule in the plane of
the bilayer (the x–y plane). Despite the fact that we have drastically simpliﬁed the
structure of the head of the constituent molecules, we decided to keep the same
number of molecules per unit area as in the case of a DMPC bilayer, in order to be
able to compare the properties of our model with those of a somehow related real
system. At crystallographic density the surface of the system BM (S) spans an
3.56 nm2, that of the system BM (L) an area 8 times larger, equal
area of 3.56
to 14.24

7.12 nm2.

The separation of the two layers in the z direction is ﬁxed at the beginning
of each simulation by setting the distance between the branching points (the C13
atoms in the picture of Fig. 1) of two opposite molecules, equal to 4.4 nm.

×

In order to build the initial bilayer conﬁguration we have started by generating
a molecule with the dihedral angles of molecule A in Table 1 of ref [16]. Tail #1
of this molecule 2 was taken to lie in the z–y plane, parallel to the z axis, with
the head pointing in the positive z direction. Notice that tail #1 shows a kink

2To be deﬁnite we call tail #1 the shortest of the two DMMG tails (the O14-C31 tail

in Fig. 1) and tail #2 the longest one (the C15-C46 tail).

in correspondence to the dihedral angle O14-C17-C19-C20, making it parallel to
tail #2 after C19. The basic molecule of the lower layer is generated by performing
a rigid rotation of the ﬁrst molecule by 180◦ around the y axis, holding ﬁx the
C13 atom. The two C13 atoms are then displaced by 4.4 nm, by translating one
molecule with respect to the other one along the z axis. The fundamental cell of
the initial crystal is an orthorhombic prism with the square basis in the x–y plane
and the longer edge along the z axis. Two copies of this pair of molecules have
been placed in the cell with the C13 atoms of the lowest molecules located one
in a vertex and the other in the center of the x–y face, respectively. Finally the
fundamental cell is replicated in the x and y directions the necessary number of
times (i.e. 4

8 times, respectively).

As usual, to limit ﬁnite-size eﬀects, both BM (S) and BM (L) samples are
taken to be periodic in the x and y directions. For simplicity of computation,
periodicity is also imposed in the z direction, but adjacent copies of the bilayer
are separated by about 100 nm, a distance so large that there are no possible
interactions among diﬀerent copies of the system.

Two diﬀerent MD codes, expressly developed by our group, were employed for
the simulations of the two systems. Both codes make use of an MTS integration
algorithm [22, 23] with a long time step of 5 fs. A short time step 10 times smaller is
introduced to integrate stretching and bending contributions. The package used for
32 molecules) was run on a Digital 500 α-station. The code

100 s of CPU-time (corresponding
to 0.5 s of CPU time for every long time-step for a system of 2368 atoms). For
the larger BM (L) system (2
256 molecules) we have employed a parallel version
of the previous code. This code evolved from the one we used in [19] to test
the level of the performances oﬀered by parallel platforms in MD simulations of
diﬀusive systems. Given the large request of computing power necessary to perform
simulations of such a big system, use was made of the parallel platform called Torre,
the largest (512 nodes, 25 Giga-ﬂops) of the today available APE computers [24].

and y coordinates of the center of mass of each molecule by the factor √µ. The
initial conﬁguration of the larger system, BM (L), was obtained by replicating the
last available conﬁguration of BM (S) with the desired values of temperature and
density, and then equilibrating the whole system for further 40 ps, again using
a velocity-rescaling algorithm. Throughout this paper we will indicate for short
by T the equilibration temperature, i.e. the temperature held ﬁxed during the
velocity-rescaling steps, and by Ts the real temperature at which the simulation
was actually run. Of course the two temperatures will be somewhat diﬀerent from
each other. For most of our considerations in this paper this diﬀerence will be of
little importance.

Few comments are in order here.
1) The simulations of the small system BM (S) are particularly long (they
range from a minimum of 0.9 ns up to a maximum of 9.9 ns, not counting the
9 = 63 points
initial velocity-rescaling equilibration steps) and span a grid of 7
in the temperature-density plane (Table 1). Notice that the trajectories employed
in the analysis presented in the next sections are all longer than 5 ns.

×

2) BM (L) simulations cover a similarly large region of temperatures and den-
sities with a total of 28 points. Trajectories are, however, much shorter (Table 2).

3 Simulation strategy

One of the reasons to perform Molecular Dynamics simulations of such complex
systems, like cell membranes, is that many biological processes are still waiting
for an explanation at molecular level. Not many of the experimental techniques
presently available may reach this goal at the resolution required and under really
well controlled physico-chemical conditions. On the other hand, it is obvious that
in order to be reasonably conﬁdent about the validity of the model used in a
simulation, the structural properties of the model must be carefully compared to
those of the “real” system so as to check the quality of the correspondence between
simulation results and actual experimental data.

In the case we are investigating, one of the most interesting macroscopic fea-
tures characterizing the biological behaviour of the system is the structure of its
phase diagram. The typical phase diagram of a phospho-lipid bilayer is repro-
duced in Fig. 2. The ﬁgure is taken from ref. [25] and refers to a Dimyristoyl-
lecitin bilayer. As it is also seen from the ﬁgure, many phases have been identiﬁed
experimentally: the most clearly separated ones are those called L, Lβ and Lα, cor-
responding to the crystal, gel and liquid-crystal phase of the system, respectively.
It is important to note here for the future comparison with simulation data that
the horizontal axis in Fig. 2 is the percentage of water per phospho-lipid molecule
and not directly the surface density. As we have argued before, however, to ﬁrst
approximation these two quantities are proportional to each other, as an increase
of water concentration has mainly the eﬀect of “diluting” the bi-dimensional ﬂuid
formed by the molecular heads.

The nature of the structural changes associated to the diﬀerent phase transi-
tions has been mainly investigated in NMR experiments. NMR data [26] indicate
that, starting from the ordered crystal phase, the transition to the gel phase corre-
sponds to an order-disorder transition of the heads, in which the tails retain their
order, but undergo a collective “tilt” with respect to the plane of the bilayer [25].
The transition to the liquid-crystal phase is related to a further order-disorder

The experiments that put in evidence the existence of these diﬀerent phases
are generally performed on liposomes (sort of artiﬁcial small cells) in solution or
on the so-called Langmuir-Blodgett multi-layers and are commonly performed at
constant pressure. In these conditions the surface density of phospho-lipid heads
changes with temperature. On the simulation side the requirement of holding the
pressure constant can be fulﬁlled by performing MD simulations in the (N pT ) en-
semble. Simulations of this type are rather delicate as they require sophisticated
strategies to force the system to move in the phase space with the appropriate sta-
tistical weight and to tame otherwise annoying numerical instabilities. It should be
immediately said, however, that today a lot of skill has been developed to properly
deal with all these problems [2, 4, 6]. Simulations in the (N V E) (micro-canonical)
ensemble are deﬁnitely much simpler and numerical stability is easily achieved.
In the micro-canonical ensemble pressure and temperature are not independent
variables and can in principle be determined once the values of the density, N/V ,
and total energy, E, are given.

Our strategy was to make a systematic study of the structural properties of
the system by performing MD simulations at many diﬀerent values of the (N V E)
parameters in such a way as to explore quite a large set of values of temperatures
and densities. The high “resolution” of our exploration has allowed us to draw
interesting conclusions about the properties of the crystal and gel phase of the
system. Results obtained for BM (S) are conﬁrmed by the analysis of the data
we collected for the much larger system, BM (L). As we shall see, BM (L) data
are aﬀected by almost identical statistical errors as the BM (S) data, though the
available trajectories are much shorter.

3.1 Extracting physical information from simulations

Generally speaking, in order to show the existence of a phase transition one must
be able to deﬁne an appropriate set of “order parameters” which could be used
to describe the structure of the phase diagram of the system. The degree of or-
der/disorder of the system can then be monitored through functions and parame-
ters characterizing the translational and/or the orientational distribution functions
of the constituent molecules. As a general reference for this kind of analysis, we
shall follow in this paper the approach used in the discussion of liquid-crystal
simulations in ref. [27].

As a ﬁrst step in the study of the order properties of the system, we deﬁne the
average direction of the constituent molecules. This quantity is represented by the
1-st rank order parameter

(1)

~P (ℓ) =

(ℓ)

~u

hh

ii

13

where, for elongate molecules, like the ones we are dealing with, the unit vector ~u is
naturally taken as the principal axis of the inertial tensor of the molecule (i.e. the
normalized eigenvector of the inertial tensor with the lowest eigenvalue). The dou-
ble bracket in eq. (1) means average over both the Nmol (identical) molecules of
the system and over the Nconf conﬁgurations collected in the simulation. The
superscript “ℓ” (ℓ=1,2) means that the average is restricted to the ℓ-th layer (con-
ventionally we decided to call layer #1 the upper layer and layer #2 the lower
one). The z component of ~P , which is usually called P1, will be used to monitor
the average orientation of the molecules.

A further order parameter, which is also experimentally accessible (mainly in
2H-NMR experiments [26]), that can be used to parametrize the local orientational
order of molecular segments, is

S(ℓ)
i =

(2)

where the superscript “ℓ” has the same meaning as in eq. (1). In NMR experiments
βi is the angle between the i-th carbon-deuterium (Ci-D) bond in a tail and the
external static magnetic ﬁeld (which is usually taken to coincide with the normal
to the bilayer surface). Si, often called “segmental order parameter”, deﬁnes a
good order parameter as it enjoys the following characteristic properties

•

•

When the Ci-D bonds are essentially aligned in a given direction with re-
spect to the magnetic ﬁeld, the system is in an ordered phase with Si

the distribution. In particular, if all the bonds have βi = 0, then Si = 1.

1)

−

When the distribution of cos βi is ﬂat (i.e. when all the values of cos βi
appear with equal probability), Si = 0 and the system is in a completely
disordered phase.

The crucial point that must be taken into account in trying to adapt the above
deﬁnition to the situation one encounters in numerical simulations is that the order
parameter we would like to deﬁne should allow us to distinguish in a clear way
genuine order–disorder transitions from possibly present (and also very interesting)
transitions between diﬀerent kinds of ordered structures. The latter is precisely the
situation that occurs experimentally in the crystal⇀↽gel transition, where, as we
recalled above, the phase transition appears to be characterized by the following
two structural changes: 1) heads undergo an order–disorder transition, 2) tails
remain ordered, but the angle made by their average direction with the normal
to the plane of the bilayer increases signiﬁcantly (tilt). The problem with the
deﬁnition (2) is that, in the situation in which the reference axis is taken to be the

14

6
same for all tail segments and lie parallel to the bilayer normal, an overall change
in the direction of the tails with respect to it will actually aﬀect the value of the
order parameter (making it smaller), much in the same way a real increase of the
disorder of the tails would do.

To overcome this type of diﬃculties it was suggested in [27] that the way to
appropriately monitor the local orientational order of atomic segments along the
molecule is to use the formal expression given in eq. (2), but with βi the Euler
angles formed by the z axes of suitably chosen local reference frames (see below)
with the average direction of the molecules in the layer to which the segments one
is considering belong. Each local frame is deﬁned by taking the z axis parallel to
the segment connecting two non-contiguous carbon atoms along a tail.

Let us now see how these general considerations are translated into precise
formulae. Since we are interested in investigating 2-nd rank tensor properties of
the system, as those that are extracted from NMR experiments, it is convenient to
measure order with respect to the directions of “maximum 2-nd rank order” [18,
28]. These directions are determined starting from the construction of the traceless
tensor (whose deﬁnition closely parallels that of quadrupole moment of a charge
distribution [29])

where ~u is a unit vector related to the geometry of the molecules, δ is the Kro-
necker symbol and again one deﬁnes a Q-tensor for each one of the two layers.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Q reﬂect collective orientational properties of the
system. For instance, if the phase is uniaxial (more mathematically, if the system
is a collection of objects with D∞,h point space group symmetry), ~u should be
taken as the direction of the principal axis of inertia of the molecules. Then Q
will have one positive eigenvalue, say, λ (usually called P2) and two identical neg-
ative eigenvalues,
λ/2. A biaxial phase is characterized by the fact that the two
negative eigenvalues are not equal, while a more complicated orientational order
is reﬂected in a non-trivial dependence of the eigenvectors of Q on the choice of ~u.
In the uniaxial phase the (normalized) eigenvector corresponding to the highest
eigenvalue, λ, is called “director” and will be indicated by ~d(ℓ) in the following. In
our case ~d(ℓ) represents the average direction of alignment of the long molecular
axes in layer ℓ.

−

A precise notion of local order in each layer is introduced by comparing the
orientation of a local rigid frame associated to any given molecular fragment with
the orientation of a ﬁxed reference frame, related to the collective order of the
system, which we will identify with the (orthogonal) eigenvectors of Q(ℓ). Given
three non-aligned atoms, indexed by i1, i2 and i3 the local frame associated to

15

i1i2i3), is constructed by taking the z axis as the vector
each fragment, i (i
joining the atom i1 with the atom i3 and the y–z plane as the plane where the
three atoms lie. The azimuthal and polar angles (αi and βi) of the director ~d(ℓ) in
these local frames can be used in turn to specify their orientation.

≡

It is important to remark that, in comparing values of the order parameter,
Si, constructed through eq. (2) where the angles βi are deﬁned as described above,
with numbers extracted from NMR experiments, the latter must be multiplied
by a suitable numerical factor. This is related to the fact that in our deﬁnition
of order parameter we monitor the orientation of the segment joining, say, the
two non-contiguous Ci-Ci+2 atoms, while the two experimentally relevant Ci+1-D
bonds, whose average direction is extracted from NMR data, lie in a plane almost
perpendicular to it. Given the relative orientation of the diﬀerent reference systems
we have introduced, it can be shown, using Wigner rotation matrices, that in our
geometrical conditions this factor is always very near to

2 [26].

To monitor the translational order/disorder properties it is customary to make
reference to the pair distribution function. Given the strong anisotropy of the
molecule arrangement, typical of our system, it is convenient to deﬁne the two pair
distribution functions, gk(rk) and g⊥(r⊥), where rk and r⊥ represent the length of
the components of the vector joining the atoms of the pair in the direction parallel
to the bilayer normal and in the plane perpendicular to it, respectively. As usual,
gk and g⊥ are normalized to the corresponding ideal gas distributions at the same
density. We thus write

−

gk =

g⊥ =

hk
hg
k

h⊥
hg
⊥

(4)

where h(r) is the number of pairs of atoms at (parallel, or respectively perpendic-
ular) distance equal to r and hg(r) is the corresponding quantity for the ideal gas
at the same density. It should be noted that we separately deﬁne a g⊥ distribution
for each one of the two layers by correspondingly limiting the calculation to the
appropriate set of molecules.

3.2 Data analysis

For an ergodic system micro-canonical averages are computed as time averages of
inﬁnitely long trajectories. Such time averages are approximated in practice by
averages over the largest possible number of independent conﬁgurations one can
collect (given the available computing power) and representative of the inﬁnite set
of conﬁgurations of the system. As for the statistical error to be attributed to
these ensemble averages, one should take the associated standard deviation.

A look at the time evolution of the BM (S) system and, in particular, at the
behaviour of the inter-molecular energy (Einter) shows that a plateau is smoothly

16

reached in most cases only after about 2.5-3 ns. In view of this rather slow equi-
libration time we prudentially decided to exclude from the analysis presented in
the next section the ﬁrst 3 ns of each MD trajectory.

The situation is much better for the BM (L) system for two reasons. One is
that, as we explained before, the initial conﬁguration of each BM (L) simulation
was obtained by replicating the (already well equilibrated) last available conﬁgura-
tion of the BM (S) system and further proceeding with an equilibration of the full
system. The second is that the equilibration time of a larger system is naturally
shorter.

To decide how distant in time two successive conﬁgurations should be in order
to consider them as uncorrelated, we studied the auto-correlation function of the
potential energy. In the case of the BM (S) system, we found that, after removing
from the analysis the conﬁgurations referring to the ﬁrst 3 ns of each trajectory for
the reasons explained above, the auto-correlation function dies away in a few ps at
all values of density and temperature. A similar situation occurs in the case of the
BM (L) system (though all the available conﬁgurations, produced after the initial
velocity-rescaling equilibration, were kept in the analysis). Accordingly, we then
decided to record a conﬁguration every 1000 long time-step iterations (i.e. every
5 ps) in all cases.

For the small system this means that we will have at our disposal not less
than 480 uncorrelated conﬁgurations (and sometimes much more, up to 1380, see
Table 1), that can be used in the forthcoming analysis. For the larger system
BM (L), where much shorter trajectories have been collected, averages will be
taken over a signiﬁcantly smaller number of conﬁgurations. Despite this fact,
thanks to the much larger size of the sample BM (L) compared to that of BM (S),
statistical errors turn out to be of comparable magnitude.

4 Results

Out of the many surface densities we have explored we will show data corre-
sponding to the three cases, µ = 1.0, 0.83 and 0.69, that roughly represent the
experimental densities of the three most signiﬁcant phases of the DMPC bilayer,
i.e. crystal, gel and liquid-crystal, respectively. For each of these densities we will
discuss results at three diﬀerent temperatures (Tables 1 and 2). The temperatures
we have considered were chosen so as to have them below, in between and above
the two most signiﬁcant phase transitions (crystal⇀↽gel and gel⇀↽liquid-crystal)
the DMPC bilayer undergoes (see Fig. 2).

Despite the fact that we do not regard the results we obtained at the lowest
density as physically interesting for the description of the expected liquid-crystal

phase of a bilayer, we will nevertheless brieﬂy discuss them in this section, mainly
to contrast these data with what we get at the more reliable values of the density,
µ=1.0 and µ=0.83. This discussion may also be very useful to identify where and
how our model should be improved.

4.1 The system BM(S)

We shall start our analysis by discussing the data we get from the simulations of
the system BM (S), for which we have collected very long trajectories (see Table 1).
We will use the results coming from the BM (L) system to reﬁne and conﬁrm the
physical picture that emerges.

4.1.1 Thermodynamic properties

The density and temperature dependence of Einter and P2 should show marked
variations in correspondence to ﬁrst or second order phase transitions. In Table 3
a smooth and rather ﬂat dependence of Einter on T and µ is, instead, seen 3.
This may be partly due to a still too coarse grid of points in the temperature and
density plane and partly to the ﬁnite size of the simulated systems.

3In the third column of Table 3 we have reported the actual physical temperature, Ts,

of each simulation.

At all values of density and temperature the molar heat capacity per atom,
cV , which was computed according to [30, 19], shows values in the range 3–3.5 (in
units of the gas constant, R), which are typical of a molecular liquid.

As for the parameter P1 (eq. (1)), we see from Table 4 that it is rather sensitive
to the average orientation of the molecules with respect to the z-axis (which,
we remember, coincides with the bilayer normal) and, as expected, it steadily
decreases with the density.

We remark that the values of the parameters P1, P2 and dz (see Tables 4,
5 and 6) for the two layers are consistent with each other within three (most
often, two) standard deviations for the two highest values of µ (i.e. µ=1.0 and

19

0.83). There is instead a statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence, especially at the highest
temperatures, if one compares values referring to the upper and lower layer at
the lowest density. This is due to rare events in which some of the molecules
in the upper/lower layer rotate upward/downward relatively to the bilayer plane.
Unfortunately the characteristic times of these motions are too long compared to
the length of the trajectories we have produced to be in position of adequately
sampling this dynamics.
It is then not surprising to ﬁnd that, within the time
window of our simulations, the two layers do not appear statistically identical.

Although we do not see any sign of instability of our bilayer model at anyone
of the values of density and temperature we have explored (we have performed
simulations at densities as low as µ=0.69 and temperatures as high as T =350 K)
10 ns),
or after very long simulation times (some of the trajectories are as long as
we will not consider data referring to µ=0.69 as physically signiﬁcant, in view of
the undesired behaviour described above.

∼

All the data presented in this section are consistent with the description of
the bilayer as an oriented molecular liquid, if one excludes the density µ=0.69,
where the system starts to show an increasing degree of isotropy. As for other
structural parameters, particularly the pair distribution functions (see below), they
show a high level of translational order that is progressively lost when the density
decreases or the temperature increases. Finally, it is worth noticing that decreasing
the density aﬀects the orientational order in a stronger way than increasing the
temperature, indirectly suggesting that ordering is more sensitive to hydration
than to heating.

20

4.1.2 Structural properties

We start by discussing some general structural properties of the bilayer at selected
density-temperature points, that are suggested by a simple graphical inspection
of the geometry of the system. In Figs. 3 and 4 we show two views ((a) and (b))
of two snapshots of the larger bilayer, BM (L), at T =325 K and at the two den-
sities, µ=1 and 0.83, respectively. The snapshots are obtained using the program
MOLMOL [31]. In panel (a) of Figs. 3 and 4 we show the side view of the bilayer
as seen from the direction in the x–y plane from which the translational order of
the upper layer is most clearly visible. In panel (b) of Figs. 3 and 4 we show the
top view of the same pictures, obtained after rotating the bilayer by 90◦ around
an axis orthogonal to both the z axis and the direction of “best view” identiﬁed
above. As a whole, the ﬁgures show that the main eﬀect of decreasing the density
is a progressive tilt in the average orientation of the molecules with respect to the
bilayer normal.

Further information on the translational order properties of the system can be
gained by looking at Figs. 5 and 6, where we have plotted at the two (density, tem-
perature) values considered above, namely (a)=(1, 325 K) and (b)=(0.83, 325 K)),
the projections on the x–y plane of the segment joining the two atoms of the pair
C10-C13 (Fig. 5) and C24-C37 (Fig. 6), as they evolve in time. The two pairs
we consider are taken to belong to the upper layer. They diﬀer in their average
distance from the middle plane lying in between the two layers: the C10-C13 pair
can be used to describe the orientation of the head, as the two atoms belong to the
top portion of the lipid molecule, while the C24-C37 pair can be used to monitor
the orientation of the imaginary rectangle roughly containing the two molecular
tails, because the C24 and C37 atoms belong to diﬀerent tails and are located
at more or less the same height from the C13 joint. A remarkable feature, quite
evident in all the ﬁgures, is that molecules undergo ﬂuctuations in local positional
energy minima that are spatially well ordered at high density and progressively
less ordered as the density decreases. An other interesting question that can be
studied by analyzing Figs. 5 and 6 is the eﬀect of density on the degree of molecule
packing: the range of positional ﬂuctuations at µ=0.83 is smaller than that at the
higher density, µ=1, both for heads (Fig. 5) and tails (Fig. 6). This means that
the larger space the molecules have at their disposal, going from higher to lower
densities, does not directly inﬂuence their actual translational freedom. The rea-
son for this behaviour may be due to the fact that a decrease of the interaction
potential among the molecules in each layer (that occurs because molecules are
more separated) is at least partly compensated by the stronger interaction poten-
tial between the two layers (which follows from the fact that an increase of the
molecular tilt angle decreases the distance between the two layers).

Finally, an inspection to the geometry of single molecules in diﬀerent density-
temperature conditions shows that at µ=1, T =150 K, the longer C15-C46 tail
(tail #2) lies essentially parallel to the head, while the O14-C31 tail (tail #1)
shows a kink in correspondence to the dihedral angle O14-C17-C19-C20, making
it parallel to tail #2 after C19. This geometric arrangement, that is present in
the initial crystallographic structure [16], becomes “inverted” at smaller densities
and even at µ=1 at the highest temperature, T =325 K, in the sense that the
kink appears instead in the longer tail #2. In this situation the two tails happen
to have almost the same eﬀective length, if counted from the common branching
point, C13. The related torsional changes occurring in the neighborhood of the
branching region seems to be a very important ingredient in arranging the internal
molecular structure so as to comply with the tilting and packing of molecules
taking place in each layer.

4.1.3 Pair distribution functions

The information obtained through the graphical investigations we have just de-
scribed can be quantiﬁed in a useful way with the help of the pair distribution
functions and the order parameters deﬁned in the previous section.

In Fig. 7 the g⊥ distribution of C10 (panel (a)) and C24 pairs (panel (b)) at
T =325 K and for the three densities, µ=1, 0.83 and 0.69, are compared. C10 is
the group that replaces the charged part of the head of the DMPC molecule in our
DMMG model, while C24 is a group located in the deep hydrophobic region. We
see a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the translational structure between heads and tails,
which is present at all densities: tails (panel (b)) look deﬁnitely more ordered than
heads (panel (a)). At µ=1 both tails and heads are ordered (see Fig. 8 and the
solid line in Fig. 7 (b)): the system appears to be in a crystal phase. Of course
ordering of the heads is progressively lost by increasing the temperature, as seen
by comparing Fig. 7 (a) with Fig. 8. At µ=0.83 tails are still ordered but heads
shows a structure which looks more liquid-like. This is very much indicative of a
gel phase. Finally at the lowest density, µ=0.69, we see a strong disordering of the
tails, owing to molecular upward/downward rotation, with a consequent tendency
to isotropization. Looking at the shape of the dotted curve in Fig. 7 (b) and at
the P1 and P2 data at µ=0.69 in Tables 4 and 5, we are thus led to the conclusion
that at this density the system ﬁnds itself in a conﬁguration which is much too
isotropic to be possibly interpreted as the liquid-crystal phase of a bilayer.
It
should be noticed, however, that tail disordering does not seem to aﬀect the value
of the inter-molecular energy, because, as we noticed above, the potential energy
loss in each layer is compensated by a stronger interaction energy between the two
layers.

There is a correlation among the decrease in density, the tilt of the molecules
in the two layers and the decrease in the bilayer thickness.
In Fig. 9 we plot
the gk pair distribution functions of C13 atoms, again for T =325 K at the three
decreasing densities, µ=1 (solid line), 0.83 (dashed line) and 0.69 (dotted line).
The ﬁrst thing that should be noted is the presence of very pronounced peaks at
rk ≈
0. These peaks come from the contributions of pairs of atoms belonging to
the same layer. Concentrating our attention to the region rk > 0.5 nm, we see
that the solid and dashed curves show narrow peaks, sticking out over a region
3.3 nm, respectively. They
of vanishing gk, centered at rk ≈
are indicative for the existence of two well separated layers. We remark that the
ﬁrst number is not too far from the value of the experimental bilayer thickness,
4 nm at the same density and temperature. The shift in the location of
which is
this peak is nicely explained by the progressive molecule tail tilting, taking place
by lowering the density, which tends to reduce the bilayer thickness. The overall
shape of the dotted curve in Fig. 9 is, instead, completely diﬀerent: ﬁrst of all the
rightmost peak is much broader than the corresponding peak seen in the other
two curves and secondly there is no region where gk is zero: in fact, pretty soon,
to the left of the rightmost peak gk starts to grow again. This behaviour reﬂects
the fact that at this density the two layers partially overlap, as a consequence of
the tendency to isotropization described above. Again, we notice that the eﬀect
of increasing the temperature on the bilayer thickness is negligible, if compared to
what happens when we lower the density. For instance, increasing the temperature
from 150 K to 325 K produces a thickness variation (which is maximal at µ=0.83)
of only 0.3 nm, while by decreasing the density from µ = 1 to µ = 0.83 and from
µ = 0.83 to µ = 0.69, the peak in Fig. 9 gets shifted by
1 nm,
respectively.

4.1.4 Angular Distributions

In Fig. 10 we show the distribution function P (θ) of the polar angle, θ, formed by
the bilayer normal with the z axis of the local frame identiﬁed by the atoms C34-
C40-C46 of tail #2. This direction, which, we recall, is chosen to be parallel to the
vector joining the C34-C46 atoms, is practically aligned with the long molecular
axis. We show the results for the lower layer only, as data for the other layer are
essentially identical. The progressive tail tilting of the molecules with decreasing
density is clearly visible. We also see that the peak of the distribution moves
from 25◦ at µ=1 (long-dashed line) to 40◦ at µ=0.83 (short-dashed line). At the
lowest density (dotted line) the distribution becomes rather broad, but still peaked
around 40◦. The experimental tilt angle for similar systems in the gel phase, which
has been measured to be about 30◦ [32], is well consistent with these results. We

A ﬁnal structural investigation has been performed on the population of the
diﬀerent torsional states along the tails. Since the local torsional potential has
three energy wells, corresponding to two gauche states (φ=60◦ and 300◦) with
the same energy and one trans state (φ=180◦) with a diﬀerent energy 4, we can
adequately characterize the situation by a parameter, usually called Pg, which
represents the percentage of the total gauche population belonging to each torsion.
We ﬁnd at T =325 K the results reported in Table 7. In this computation we have
averaged data over the two tails and the two layers. Values smaller than 1 % are
not reported.

At the two highest densities only the last two torsions (C27-C28-C29-C30, C28-
C29-C30-C31) in tail #1 and the corresponding ones in tail #2 show a population
larger than 1%. The high values, Pg=25% and Pg=50%, that we ﬁnd for the

O16-C32) and (O14-C17-C19-C20) + (O16-C32-C34-C35), respectively, are due
to the distortion of the geometry in the “kinked” region close to the ester bond.
These values are essentially the same for all densities and temperatures and are
due to the phenomenon of “kink inversion” between the two tails, described before.
It is worth noticing that the µ=0.83 results are consistent with those obtained for
the DPPC in the gel phase [2, 4], after correcting for the fact that the DPPC
hydrophobic tails are 2 methylene groups longer than the DMPC tails.

The smooth increase of the gauche population along the tails, seen in the
simulations performed at the lowest density, means that the rotational freedom of
molecule tails does not help in making the tail ﬂexibility in the terminal region
larger than that in the core. This is at variance with the results of the ﬁrst paper
of ref. [4], where a larger mobility of tail end segments, as compared to what is
seen in the core region, was found in simulations of the liquid-crystal phase of
DPPC. Values around 20 % for Pg for the last six torsions of the tails are, in fact,
reported. One might argue that the little tail ﬂexibility we ﬁnd in our model might
be attributed to the much too strong 1-4 LJ potential we have introduced in each
torsion. These 1-4 forces mainly have the eﬀect of adding a steric repulsion in the
gauche conformations. We recall that within the framework of the OPLS force-
ﬁeld [20], which we employed in the present paper, we have reduced, according
to the general OPLS philosophy, the strength of the 1-4 LJ potential by a factor
8. This may not have been enough in view of the too high tail rigidity we have
found. However, neglecting 1-4 forces altogether gives results only partially in the

the gauche population by a large factor (in trial simulations performed on liquid
butane this factor is found to be about 3), but on the other hand it leads to
a more pronounced upward/downward molecular rotational freedom, which may
make even more problematic for the system to unveil its liquid-crystal phase.

4.1.5 Segmental Order Parameter

In Fig. 11 we show the behaviour of the order parameter, Si (eq. (2) of sect. 3.1), as
function of the position of the (Ci-Ci+2) segment along the tail 5. Panels (a) and
(b) show the results for tail #1 and #2, respectively, averaged over the two layers.
We focus on the behaviour of Si at T =325 K and diﬀerent densities. We see that,
correctly, the order parameter decreases with the density (the expectation for a
completely isotropic ﬂuid would be Si=0). Notice that, not surprisingly, data at
the lowest density are aﬀected by errors that are deﬁnitely larger than those on

5We observe that the notation (Ci-Ci+2) does not apply to the initial segments of the
two tails, that are called C17-C20 and C32-C35 respectively, because in the enumeration
of carbons the labels 18 and 33 are attributed to O atoms.

4.2 The system BM(L)

As summarized in Table 2, we have performed extensive MD simulations also on the
much larger system, BM (L), consisting of 2 layers of 256 DMMG molecules each.
To compare with previous results we have analyzed the trajectories corresponding
to the same combined values of surface density and temperature considered above.
An immediate observation that emerges from the analysis of BM (L) MD data is
that statistical errors are about the same as those one ﬁnds in the case of the system
BM (S), despite the fact that substantially shorter trajectories were produced
(compare Tables 1 and 2). As we already noticed, this is a direct consequence of
the increase in the size of the system and of the fact that the larger BM (L) system
was built by assembling already equilibrated BM (S) blocks with the result that

34

no special needs for further long or sophisticated equilibration procedures have
emerged.

The general conclusions of the analysis of BM (L) data is that the scenario we
have come up with in the previous sections is well conﬁrmed by the simulations
of this larger system, and we have good consistency between the two sets of data
within errors.

position along tail #1 (a) and tail #2 (b) for the BM(L) system (squares)
and for the BM(S) system (triangles). The lines joining the points are only
to guide the eye.

As an example of the quality of the results that we have obtained, we compare
in Figs. 12 and 13 the behaviour of the order parameter S, for the two systems,
BM (S) and BM (L) at T =325 K and µ=1 and µ=0.83, separately for the two tails,
averaged over the two layers. The BM (L) points are systematically lower than
the BM (S) data, as expected from the lowering of the collective orientational
order with the increasing size of the system. This eﬀect is more relevant for
segments close to the head and to the end of the tails. The slightly larger errors
that aﬀect the data associated to the ﬁrst and the last tail segment are due to
jumps among diﬀerent torsional states that are not suﬃciently well sampled in
the time evolution at our disposal. In order to reduce errors associated to this

35

slow torsional dynamics, it would be important to increase the length of BM (L)
simulations. Data at µ=0.69 are aﬀected by substantially larger errors and are not
shown.

The above indications about the behaviour of the degree of collective orienta-
tional order with the size of the system are conﬁrmed by a careful study of the
order parameters, P1 and P2. For instance, at µ=0.83 and T =325 K one gets
for the BM (L) system P2=0.964
0.003, a value somewhat lower than the one
observed for the smaller BM (S) system, for which an average value P2=0.984
±
0.002 is found. A lowering of the orientational order with the size of the system is
actually expected from the observation that in a bigger system ﬂuctuations with
longer wave lengths are possible.

±

Further agreement among BM (L) and BM (S) simulations emerges from the
study of translational order properties. The g⊥(r) distribution functions computed
from the BM (L) simulations show essentially the same structure and locations
of the peaks that is seen in the BM (S) distributions. The only diﬀerence is
a somewhat less pronounced peak structure in distributions referring to atoms
belonging to the hydrophobic core. Given the strong similarity of BM (L) and
BM (S) results, we do not report the former here.

We would like to conclude this section with some general considerations about

36

the quest for MD simulations of larger and larger systems. Given the satisfactory
level of consistency we ﬁnd by comparing the MD data of the two samples, one
might ask whether simulations of systems as large as BM (L) are really necessary
to get the physics of the system right. Although the answer to this question
strongly depends on the kind and the degree of detail of the information one
wishes to obtain from the model, it is important to recall that the study of ﬁnite
volume eﬀects is a necessary step in any numerical simulation, because features
and properties seen at small volumes may completely change when the volume is
increased. Consequently it is absolutely mandatory to get an idea of the magnitude
of ﬁnite volume corrections. From our experience it was only thanks to the data
we had for the larger system that we could reliably draw useful conclusions on the
structural properties of our model-membrane.

Apart from these rather general considerations, there are in our opinion many
speciﬁc problems where the fact of having a suﬃciently large system is crucial in
order to be in the position of extracting reliable results from numerical simulations.
Just to make two examples we may mention:

1) the problem of trying to accurately locate the critical lines of the phase
diagram of the system. The obvious reason for the necessity of comparing systems
of diﬀerent sizes is that a structural change of the system can be interpreted as
a true phase transition only if one is able to show that the transition becomes
sharper and sharper as the volume increases.

2) Another very interesting problem is the study of the dynamic and the for-

required by the need of having the cross section of the channel suﬃciently smaller
than the surface of the bilayer itself in order to meet as accurately as possible
the actual physical situation. We wish to mention in this context the pioneering
investigation recently carried out in the beautiful work of ref. [7], where it has
been shown that indeed channels have the possibility of forming and dynamically
maintaining themselves stable.

5 Conclusions

We have performed a systematic MD study of the structural properties of a simple
atomistic model of bilayer by analyzing the behaviour of a large number of physical
quantities characterizing the system, as functions of density and temperature, and
by comparing results obtained from simulations carried out on two systems of
largely diﬀerent size.

We have found that our modelization reproduces in a remarkable way many
known features of the gel phase of DMPC bilayers [25], as well as the structural

37

changes that accompany the transition from the crystal to the gel phase. These
ﬁndings have emerged quite clearly by analyzing the very long trajectories we have
collected for the system, BM (S), and are nicely conﬁrmed by the statistically
equally accurate data we have for the much larger system, BM (L).

Clearly a lot of work is still needed to further validate and improve our ap-
proach, especially in the direction of investigating the role of water, whose eﬀects
were only indirectly accounted for through the modulation of the surface density
of the system. The inability of the model to cope with the expected liquid-crystal
phase of the system at low density is its major limitation. To prevent the extru-
sion of the molecule tails from the planes of the bilayer at low density and high
temperature, either some sort of geometric or dynamic constraint must be intro-
duced, perhaps by modifying the intra-molecular tail ﬂexibility, or more directly
one should explicitly introduce water.

Despite the limitations we have mentioned, from the quality of the results
presented in this investigation, we conclude that the membrane model we have
developed is capable of capturing most of the essential structural properties of the
real system in the crystal and gel phase. Thanks to its simplicity, we are conﬁ-
dent that it will be possible to appropriately improve the model in the directions
mentioned above, without aﬀecting the key features that are at the basis of the
stability of our bilayer, i.e. tail packing within the layers and adequately strong
interactions between the two layers.

Dynamical instrument limitations, such as ﬁnite detection bandwidth, do not simply add statis-
tical errors to ﬂuctuation measurements, but can create signiﬁcant systematic biases that aﬀect the
measurement of steady-state properties. In this article, we quantify the eﬀect of time-averaging on
video-imaged ﬂuctuations of a harmonically conﬁned Brownian particle, and present a novel method
for extracting the true spring constant and diﬀusion coeﬃcient by varying either the camera shutter
speed or the conﬁnement strength. These results are conﬁrmed both numerically with a Brownian
dynamics simulation, and experimentally with a laser optical trap. We also describe practical re-
quirements for properly calibrating an optical trap using the blur-corrected equipartition analysis
and power spectrum methods.

INTRODUCTION

Investigations of micro- to nano-scale phenomena at ﬁnite temperature (e.g. single-molecule measurements, mi-
crorheology) require a detailed treatment of the Brownian ﬂuctuations that mediate weak interactions and kinetics
[1, 2, 3, 4]. Experimental quantiﬁcation of such ﬂuctuations are aﬀected by instrument limitations, which can in-
troduce errors in surprising ways. Dynamical limitations, such as ﬁnite detection bandwidth, do not simply add
statistical errors to ﬂuctuation measurements, but can create signiﬁcant systematic biases that aﬀect the measure-
ment of steady-state properties such as ﬂuctuation amplitudes and probability densities (e.g. position histograms).

Image blur, which is a common problem when imaging fast moving objects, results from time-averaging a signal
over a ﬁnite integration time. This problem is especially important in the measurement of Brownian ﬂuctuations,
where even fast detection methods can have long integration times with respect to the relevant time scale, as we will
demonstrate in this paper. Instrument bandwidth limitations depend not only on the sample rate, but also on the
integration time of the detector, which is perhaps the more critical parameter as it determines the extent of motion
blur.

The eﬀects of motion blur are relevant for a variety of ﬂuctuation-based measurement techniques, including the
measurement of forces with magnetic tweezers using lateral ﬂuctuations [5], and microrheology measurements based
on the video-tracking of small particles [6]. However, in this work we focus on the calibration of an optical trap by
analyzing conﬁned Brownian motion [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. While the issue of video-image blur has recently emerged in the
microrheology literature [12], discussion has been notably absent in the area of ultra-sensitive force-probes, despite
the signiﬁcant eﬀect that it can have on quantitative measurements.

In this paper we quantify the role of integration time on the measurement of Brownian ﬂuctuations in a harmonic
potential. First, in section (2) we calculate how the measured variance of the position of a harmonically trapped
Brownian particle depends on the integration time of the detection apparatus, the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the bead
and the trap stiﬀness. Next, we compare this relationship with both simulated data and experimental data using
an optical trap. Results from the Brownian dynamics simulation are presented in section (3), and the experimental
veriﬁcation appears in section (4). We also oﬀer some practical implications of this work, including a new prescription
for calibrating an optical trap that corrects and extends both the commonly used equipartition and power spectrum
methods to accurately measure the spring constant. Furthermore, we show that analysis of motion blur can provide
valuable information about the dynamics of bead motion, enabling the determination of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient by
varying either the shutter speed or the conﬁnement strength. This discussion is presented in section (5), and is followed
by the conclusion and appendices.

2. CALCULATION OF THE MEASURED VARIANCE OF A HARMONICALLY TRAPPED
BROWNIAN PARTICLE

Detection systems, such as video cameras and photodiodes, do not measure the instantaneous position of a particle.
Rather, the measured position Xm is an average of the true position X taken over a ﬁnite time interval, which we
call the integration time W . In the simplest model,

Xm(t) =

1
W

t

t−W

X(t′)dt′

Z
where both the measured and true positions of the particle have been expressed as functions of time t. More complex
situations can be treated by multiplying X(t′) by an instrument-dependent function within the integral, i.e. by using
a non-rectangular integration kernel.

We consider the case of a particle undergoing Brownian motion within a harmonic potential, U (x) = 1

2 kx2. In
equilibrium, we expect the probability density of the particle position to be established by the Boltzmann weight
exp(−U (x)/kBT ), where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature:

The variance of the position should then satisfy the equipartition theorem,

var(X) ≡

var(Xm) ≤ var(X)

(cid:11)
However, these equations do not hold for the measured position Xm. In particular, image blur introduces a systematic
bias in the measured variance,

(cid:10)

In the following subsections, we calculate precisely how the measured variance depends upon the spring constant
k, the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the particle D, and the integration time of the imaging device W . This calculation is
performed in two diﬀerent ways: (2.1) a frequency-space calculation that convolves the true particle trajectory with
the appropriate moving-average ﬁlter, and (2.3) a real-space calculation using Green’s functions. An expression for
the modiﬁed power spectrum of the harmonically conﬁned bead that accounts for the eﬀects of ﬁltering and aliasing
is included in the frequency-space calculation (see subsection (2.2))

The measured trajectory of a particle in the presence of image blur Xm(t) can be calculated by convolving the true

trajectory X(t) with a rectangular function,

where H(t) is deﬁned by:

The integral is taken over the full range of values (i.e. t′ is integrated from −∞ to +∞), which is our convention
whenever limits are not explicitly written. The width of the rectangle W is simply the integration time as previously
deﬁned. This convolution acts as an ideal moving average ﬁlter in time, and is consistent with the integral expression
for Xm(t) given in Eq. (1).

Taking the power spectrum of Eq. (5) yields:

Using Parseval’s Theorem and integrating the power spectrum P (ω) yields the true variance of X(t),

which is in agreement with the equipartition theorem. Similarly, we calculate the measured variance var(Xm) as a

2.2. Blur-corrected ﬁltered power spectrum

Often, trap calibration is performed by ﬁtting the power spectrum of a conﬁned particle. Here we provide a modi-
ﬁcation to the standard functional form P (ω) that accounts for both exposure time eﬀects and aliasing. Combining
expressions 7, 8 and 9, we can see the eﬀect of exposure time on the measured power spectrum:

Additionally, the eﬀect of aliasing can be accounted for:

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

where ωs is the angular sampling frequency (i.e. the data acquisition rate times 2π). Aliasing changes the shape of
the power spectrum, so neglecting it when ﬁtting can cause errors. The sum in Eq. (18) can be calculated numerically
and ﬁt to experimental data. It is typically suﬃcient to calculate only the ﬁrst few terms.

It is important to note that aliasing does not aﬀect our result for the measured variance, Eq. (12). Aliasing shifts
power into the wrong frequencies, but does not change the integral of the power. Hence, var(Xm) is unchanged.
A detailed discussion of power spectrum calibration with an emphasis on photodiode detection systems is given in
reference [11].

Xm(x0) =

X(t | x0)dt

Since a Brownian particle follows a random trajectory X(t), the measured position Xm is a random function of the

true position of the particle at the start of the integration time, i.e.

0
Z
where X(t | x0) is the actual position of the bead at time t given that it is at position x0 at time zero, and W is the
integration time as deﬁned previously. In other words, even with knowledge of the initial particle position, it is not
possible to predict what the measured position will be. However, the distribution of Xm is well-deﬁned, and one can
determine its moments.

The variance of the measured position is given by

var(Xm) ≡

Xm(X)2

− hXm(X)i2

Notice that to calculate the ensemble average h. . .i, we must average over both the random initial position X, and
the measured position for a given initial position Xm(x). For the harmonic potential U (x) = 1
2 kx2, hXm(X)i = 0 by
symmetry, so the variance reduces to

var(Xm) =

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

where ρX (x0) is the probability density of the initial position, and the integral is taken over all space (consistent with
our previously stated convention). In equilibrium, ρX (x0) is simply the Boltzmann distribution given in Eq. (2).

Using Eq. (19), we express

Xm(x0)2

as the double integral

In the second step, the ensemble average is brought into the integral, and the averaging condition t2 > t1 is added,
which changes the limits of integration.

The time-ordered auto-correlation function hX(t1)X(t2)it2>t1 can be calculated using the Green’s function of the
diﬀusion equation for a harmonic potential, ρ (x, t | x0, t0). The Green’s function represents the probability density
for ﬁnding the particle at position x at time t given that it is at x0 at time t0. It can be found by solving the diﬀusion

where we have deﬁned the dimensionless function:

V (t) = 1 − exp(−2t/τ )

As before τ = kBT /(kD) = γ/k. Notice that this is simply a spreading Gaussian distribution with the mean given
by the deterministic (non-Brownian) position of a particle connected to a spring in an overdamped environment,
and with a variance that looks like free diﬀusion at short time scales (i.e.
initially increasing as 2D(t − t0)), but
exponentially approaching the equilibrium value of kBT /k on longer time scales.

The time-ordered auto-correlation function can be written as follows:

hX(t1)X(t2)it2>t1 =

x1x2ρ(x1, t1 | x0, 0)ρ(x2, t2 | x1, t1)dx1 dx2

where V (t) and τ are as deﬁned above.

Carrying out the double time integral in Eq. (22), followed by the integral over the initial position x0 of Eq. (21)

we obtain the ﬁnal result for the measured variance:

This reproduces the result of the frequency-space calculation presented in Eq. (12). The ideal power spectrum can
be obtained from the position auto-correlation function of Eq. (28). We determine the long-time limit of the auto-
correlation function by letting t1 ≫ τ , which yields the simpliﬁed equation:

Next, by taking the Fourier transform of this equation with respect to (t2 − t1) we obtain the standard result of
Eq. (8).

To verify our analysis results numerically, we use a simple Brownian dynamics simulation of a bead ﬂuctuating in
a harmonic potential. For each time step ∆t, the change in the bead position ∆x is given by a discretization of the
overdamped Langevin equation:

where δx(∆t) is a Gaussian random variable with hδxi = 0 and
= 2D∆t, and the deterministic force
fdet = −kx corresponds to a harmonic potential as in our calculation. Motion blur is simulated by time-averaging the
simulated bead positions over a ﬁnite integration time W . To minimize errors due to discretization, the simulation
sampling time is much smaller than both W and Γ/m. Fig. 1 (a) shows the simulation results for 3 diﬀerent bead and
spring constant settings as described in the ﬁgure caption. Agreement with the image blur correction function S(α)
of Eq. (15) is within the fractional standard error of the variance, ∼
2/N [15]. We observe in Figure 1 (b) that the
distribution of measured positions is a Gaussian random variable with variance var(Xm) < kBT /k, and is therefore
fully characterized by the mean (trap center) and the measured variance calculated in Eq. (12).

Instrument description

The optical trap is formed by focusing 1064 nm near-IR laser light (Coherent Compass 1064-4000M Nd:YVO4
laser) through a high numerical aperture oil immersion objective (Zeiss Plan Neoﬂuar 100x/1.3) into a closed, water
ﬁlled chamber. Laser power is varied with a liquid-crystal power controller (Brockton Electro-Optics). This optical
tweezers system is integrated into an inverted light microscope (Zeiss Axiovert S100).

The trapped bead is imaged with transmitted bright ﬁeld illumination provided by a 100 W halogen lamp (Zeiss
HAL 100). The image is observed with a high-speed cooled CCD camera with adjustable exposure time (Cooke high
performance SensiCam) connected to a computer running custom data acquisition software [16]. Each video frame
is processed in real-time to determine the position of the trapped bead. Fast one-dimensional position detection is
accomplished by analyzing the intensity proﬁle of a single line passing through the bead center. To increase the
spatially integrates) several lines about the bead
signal to noise ratio and the frame rate, the camera bins (i.e.
center (32 in this experiment) to form the single line used in analysis. A third order polynomial is ﬁt to the two
minima corresponding to the one-dimensional “edges” of the bead, giving sub-pixel position detection with a measured

4.2. Experimental conditions

The sample chamber was prepared with pure water and polystyrene beads (Duke Scientiﬁc certiﬁed size standards
4203A, 3.063 µm ± 0.027 µm). Experiments were performed by holding a bead in the optical trap and varying the
power and the exposure time. The bead was held 30 µm from the closest surface, and the lamp intensity was varied
with exposure time to ensure a similar intensity proﬁle for each test. For each test, both edges of the bead in one
dimension were recorded and averaged to estimate the center position.

4.3. Experimental Results

The one-dimensional variance of a single bead in an optical trap was measured at various laser powers and exposure
times. Low frequency instrument drift was ﬁltered out as described in Appendix A. For each power, measured
variance vs. exposure time data was ﬁt with Eq. (32) to yield values for the spring constant k, friction factor γ, and
instrument error ε2. Error estimates in the variance were calculated from the standard error due to the ﬁnite sample
size, and variations due to vertical drift.

Error in the ﬁtting parameters indicate that the best estimate for γ and ε2 occur at the lowest and highest powers,
respectively. These estimates both agree within 2% of the error weighted average for all powers. For the nominal bead
size, γ agrees with the Stokes’ formula calculation to within 11%, indicating a slightly smaller bead or lower water
viscosity than expected. Additionally, the estimate of tracking error ε determined from the ﬁt compares favorably
with the standard deviation in position of a stuck bead, diﬀering by about half a nanometer.

For a single bead with constant experimental conditions, γ and ε2 are expected to remain essentially constant as
the laser power is varied. While laser heating could cause γ to decrease with increasing power, this eﬀect should be
small for the < 500 mW powers used here [17, 18], so this eﬀect was neglected.

Holding γ and ε2 constant for all powers, the raw data was re-ﬁt with Eq. (32) to yield k. The data for all 4 powers
was error-corrected by subtracting ε2 and was rescaled according to Eq. (14) and Eq. (15). This non-dimensionalized
data is plotted alongside the image blur correction function in Fig. 2, showing near-perfect quantitative agreement.
A plot of spring constant vs. dimensionless power is shown in Fig. 3, demonstrating the discrepancy between the
blur-corrected spring constant and na¨ıve spring constant for diﬀerent integration times. Even for a modest spring
constant of 0.03 pN/nm and a reasonably fast exposure time of 1 ms, the expected error is roughly 50%. We also note
that the blur-corrected spring constant increases linearly with laser power as expected from optical-trapping theory.
Once conﬁrmed for a given system, this linearity can be exploited to determine not only the spring constant as a
function of power but also the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the bead. This is discussed in subsection (5.3), and presented in
Fig. 3.

When the data acquisition rate is suﬃciently high relative to 1/τ = k/γ, it is feasible to calibrate the trap using
the bead position power spectrum, allowing comparisons to the previous results at low laser power. Power spectrum
ﬁtting with the blur-corrected and aliased expression (Eq. (18)) at the lowest power yielded both a spring constant and
friction factor that agree with the blur-corrected equipartition values to within 1%. Fits of the same data using the
na¨ıve expression (Eq. (8), not corrected for exposure time or aliasing) provided slightly worse results, overestimating
the spring constant by 3% and the friction factor by 7%. (See Appendix B for procedural details.)

For an additional check that does not rely on ﬂuctuations, a purely mechanical test was performed and compared
with the corrected power spectrum ﬁt. This test consisted of a bead drop experiment to determine the bead radius
and friction factor, and a trap recoil experiment to determine the spring constant. The bead drop was performed by
releasing a bead and recording its average velocity over a known distance. The trap recoil experiment was performed
by measuring the exponential decay of the same bead as it returned to the trap center after deviation in one dimension.
This mechanical test agrees with the corrected power spectrum ﬁt to within 5% for the determination of both the
spring constant and the friction factor.

5. DISCUSSION: PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR CALIBRATING AN OPTICAL TRAP

In this section, we present some practical techniques for measuring the spring constant k and diﬀusion coeﬃcient
D of a harmonically conﬁned Brownian particle. We will assume that the temperature T is known. The approaches
here are generic, and can be used even if the conﬁning potential is not an optical trap (e.g. beads embedded in a gel,
etc.) We will continue to treat the measured position as an unweighted time average of the true position over the
integration time W (Eq. (1)), which is consistent with the experimental results for our detection system. In other
situations, e.g. if the rise and fall time are not negligible relative to the exposure time, these equations and ideas can
be readily generalized as noted in section (2).

from these ﬁts for c and γ agree within error with the “black circle” values obtained by varying the exposure time.

5.1. Determining k from D and W .

If the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D of the conﬁned particle and the integration time W of the instrument is known, the
correct spring constant k can be directly obtained from the measured variance var(Xm) by using equation 12. (When
using this formula recall that γ = kBT /D.) If the tracking error ε is signiﬁcant, ε2 should ﬁrst be subtracted from
the measured variance as in equation 32. While we cannot in general isolate k in this transcendental equation, it can
easily be found numerically by utilizing a standard root-ﬁnding method. Alternatively, an approximate closed form
solution for k is derived in Appendix C.

5.2. Determining k and D by varying W

Even if the data acquisition rate of the system is not fast enough to permit a blur-corrected power spectrum ﬁt (as
described in Appendix B), k and D can still be determined by measuring the variance at diﬀerent shutter speeds and
ﬁtting to the blur-corrected variance function. This technique is demonstrated in the experimental results section,
and yields accurate measurements provided the integration time is not too much larger than the trap relaxation time
(α is not much larger than 1). Practically speaking, this is a useful technique, as the maximum shutter speed of a
camera is often much faster than the maximum data acquisition speed (e.g. it is much easier to obtain a video camera
with a 0.1 ms shutter speed than a camera with a frame rate of 10 kHz). Furthermore, this approach for quantifying
the power spectrum from the blur is quite general, and could be used in other systems. As long as the form of the
power spectrum is known, the model parameters could be determined by measuring the total variance over a suitable
spectrum of shutter speeds.

5.3. Determining k and D by varying k

Other approaches are possible if the conﬁnement of the particles can be varied in a controlled way, i.e. by varying
the laser power of the optical trap. If the spring constant varies linearly with laser power, (which is typically true
and was conﬁrmed for our system in subsection (4.3)), the ﬁrst observation is that the spring constant only needs to
be measured at a single laser power, as it can be extrapolated to other laser powers. Typically calibration should be
done at a low power, as this usually increases the accuracy of both the power spectrum ﬁt and the blur correction
technique.

9

Linearity between the spring constant and laser power can be further exploited to determine both k and D by
measuring the variance of a trapped bead at diﬀerent laser powers but with the same shutter speed. Such data can
be ﬁt to the blur model (equation 12) by introducing an additional ﬁtting parameter c that relates the laser power P
to the spring constant, i.e. we make the substitution k = cP , and perform a non-linear ﬁt to var(Xm) vs. power data
in order to determine c and D. (When using equation 12 recall that τ = kBT /(Dk)) Equivalently, we can express the
na¨ıve spring constant km = kBT /var(Xm) as a function of c and P , and perform a ﬁt to km vs. P data as shown in
Fig. 3 of the experimental results subsection (4.3), where the viability of this method is demonstrated.

5.4. Design strategies for using the blur technique

When using these motion blur techniques to characterize the dynamics of conﬁned particles, we reiterate that it is
the shutter speed and not the data acquisition speed that limits the dynamic range of a measurement. Thus, even
inexpensive cameras with fast shutter speeds can make dynamical measurements without requiring the investment of
a fast video camera. Alternative methods for controlling the exposure time are the use of optical shutters or strobe
lights.

6. CONCLUSIONS

We have derived and veriﬁed a relationship between the measured variance of a harmonically conﬁned particle and
the integration time of the detection device. This analysis yields a practical prescription for calibrating an optical trap
that corrects and extends both the standard equipartition and power spectrum methods. By measuring the variance
at diﬀerent shutter speeds or diﬀerent laser powers, the true spring constant can be determined by application of the
image blur correction function of Eq. (15). Additionally, this provides a new technique for determining the diﬀusion
coeﬃcient of a conﬁned particle from time-averaged ﬂuctuations.

The dramatic results from our experiment indicate that integration time of the detection device cannot be over-
looked, especially with video detection. Furthermore, we have shown that image blur need not be a detriment if it is
well understood, as it provides useful information about the dynamics of the system being studied.

APPENDIX A: HIGH-PASS FILTERING IN VARIANCE MEASUREMENTS

Calculation of the variance requires special attention, since low frequency noise or drift can inﬂate the variance
dramatically, causing an underestimation of the spring constant. A high pass ﬁlter can be used to remove low frequency
noise, but the use of any ideal ﬁlter lowers the variance by neglecting the contribution from the removed frequencies
(note Eq. (10)).

To reliably estimate the variance while accounting for low frequency drift, we ﬁrst progressively high-pass ﬁlter the
data over a range of increasing cut-oﬀ frequencies. A plot of measured variance vs. cutoﬀ frequency (Fig. 4) clearly
shows a linear trend at frequencies below the corner frequency (fc=k/2πγ). However, as the ﬁltering frequencies
approach zero, drift causes the measured variance to increase beyond its expected value. By applying a linear ﬁt and
extrapolating to the 0 Hz cutoﬀ, we can reliably estimate the “drift-free” variance of bead position.

APPENDIX B: EXPERIMENTAL POWER SPECTRUM CALIBRATION

Power spectrum calibrations were performed by ﬁtting the one-sided power spectrum with Eq. (18). The original
65536 data points taken at ∼1500 samples per second were blocked into 128 non-overlapping segments. The power
spectrum of the blocks were calculated separately and averaged to produce the data in Fig. 5. This procedure is well
described in the literature [9, 11].

Accounting for instrument error in the power spectrum ﬁt is more diﬃcult than the equipartition case, requiring
knowledge of the frequency dependence of the error. For this study, the power spectrum of a nonmoving bead was
subtracted from the calibration power spectrum and the ﬁt parameters remained practically unchanged (within 2%),
allowing us to neglect error in our power spectrum ﬁts at low power. It should be noted that in other situations (e.g.
diﬀerent bead size or power), modiﬁcations to the power spectrum due to instrument error could be signiﬁcant.

Eq. (8) fails to describe the data at high frequencies, where bandwidth limitations and aliasing become important.

APPENDIX C: APPROXIMATE ANALYTICAL EXPRESSION FOR k

When W is not signiﬁcantly larger than the trap relaxation time, i.e. α = W/τ = W k/γ is not much larger than
1, an approximate version of equation 12 can be inverted to give a closed form solution for k. First, we use a Pad´e
approximation to express the image blur correction function as:

S(α) ≈

1 − 2α/15 + α2/60
1 + α/5

(C1)

Substituting this expression into equation 12 yields a quadratic equation that is easily solved for k. This results in
the following approximation for the true spring constant:

k ≈

30 kBT
2DW + 15 var(Xm) + [225 var(Xm)2 + 240DW var(Xm) − 11D2W 2]1/2

.
= 0.46.
The Pad´e approximation is good to within 3% for α < 3, which corresponds to a blur correction factor of S(3)
In other words, if the uncorrected equipartition method gives a spring constant which is within a factor of 2 of the
true value, this approximation formula should be accurate to within 3%, as we have tested numerically.

Abstract

(December 14, 2013)

Two simple (rotator and one-particle) mechanistic models are suggested

to describe simultaneously at a minimal level of sophistication two basic func-

tions of F1-ATPase: a motor regime driven by ATP hydrolysis and its inverted

function as ATP synthesis. This description is consistent with the so-called

rotary binding-change mechanism, a milestone of functioning ATP synthase,

and uses a stepping (driving) function associated with two sequences of time

instants, at which hydrolysis and synthesis reactions occur.

It is useful to

analyse experimental data and numerical simulations indeed predict corre-

sponding dynamic behavior.

Recently, the modeling of molecular motors - enzymes which transduce chemical energy

into directed mechanical motion - based on the idea of gaining useful work by rectiﬁcation

of zero-mean noise ﬂuctuations has attracted considerable attention [1] and several models

exploiting the so-called ratchet mechanism have been elaborated (see, e.g., Refs. [2–9], to

1

mention a few). In this context, ATP (adenosinetriphosphate) synthase shown schematically

in Fiq. 1, being a realistic molecular engine of great interest nowadays [10], should also be

studied from the point of view of biological physics [11]. This machinery is composed of

two rotary motors: a membrane-embedded unit F0 and water-surrounded F1-ATPase (also

called F1) connected by a coiled-coil γ subunit. ATP synthase works as a reversible motor-

pump machine: the proton ﬂow through F0 is believed to create a clockwise (when F1 is

viewed from the F0 side) torque that turns γ, whereupon ATP molecules are sequentially

synthesized at three catalytic sites, one on each β subunit. Vice versa, ATP hydrolysis,

which also occurs sequentially on β’s, but in the opposite direction, has been demonstrated

to make γ rotate backwards, converting F0 into a proton pump. In this case, γ is driven

by sequential hinge-bending motions of β’s, like a crankshaft by the pistons in a car engine

(for more details see Ref. [12]).

In this paper, we focus on F1-ATPase and consider its

operation in both hydrolysis (as a motor) and synthesis (as a synthesizer) directions, using

in parallel two simple mechanistic analogs: a plane rotator and a particle subjected to a

periodic potential. Our description is consistent with Boyer’s binding-change mechanism

[13,14], the recent ﬁndings of Cherepanov et al. and Junge et al. [15] on elasticity properties

of the γ subunit, as well as with the experimental results of Yasuda et al. [16].

The structure of F1-ATPase and the mechanics of motions within it are too complex to

allow a detailed description of all interactions and motions of its diﬀerent parts, i.e., the

three β and one γ subunits [10,12–14,17–19]. Therefore, it would be useful to describe this

very sophisticated three-dimensional system, using simple mechanical equivalents (springs,

particles, etc.) and keeping the main features of rotary dynamics found in previous studies,

such as the modeling of Oster and Wang [12] and others [10,15–19]. This approach, “from

complexity to simplicity”, is often used in biological physics. The typical example of such

a modeling is the propagation of a nerve impulse on the giant axon of the squid, where

insight in the dynamics of the original Hodgkin-Huxley equations [20] has been obtained by

reduction to the minimal FitzHugh-Nagumo system [21].

Here the three-dimensional and four-body interaction in the β3γ subcomplex is suggested

2

to be eﬀectively described as a coupling of a planar rotator of length R0 centered in the middle

of an equilateral triangle (see left panels of Figs. 2 and 3) with three equivalent catalytic

sites (denote them by numbers 1, 2, and 3) at the vertices of the triangle. Obviously, this

rotor-stator interaction, resulting in a crankshaft-like rotation of γ (and cooperative catalysis

on β’s), is a periodic function: U(θ + 2π) = U(θ), where θ denotes the angular position of

the rotator (positive if counter-clockwise). The mechanical equivalent of a driving torque

on γ can be chosen as a stretched spring or an eﬀective particle displaced from equilibrium

in the periodic potential U(θ) as illustrated in the left and the right panels of Figs. 2 and

3, respectively. At each site i = 1, 2, 3, a spring Ki is attached connecting this site with the

rotator. All the three springs are supposed to be identical, but only one spring is allowed to

be switched on, while the other two are switched oﬀ, at a time. Then sequential switching

the springs will result in a power stroke on γ. Without loss of generality, the rotor-stator

potential (given in units of the hydrolysis energy W

nm) can be written as

±

Let us now describe how our spring system operates in both the hydrolysis and synthesis

directions and how it can be coordinated with ATP hydrolysis/synthesis reactions at the

catalytic sites of the β subunits. According to Boyer’s hypothesis [13] supported by the

structural studies by Walker and coworkers [14], and recently by direct observation of Noji

et al. [18], each site 1, 2, or 3 can be found at least in one of the three states: T (ATP

binding), E (empty), and D (ADP binding), at a time. Structurally, they are arranged as

T, E, and D counter-clockwise (see Figs. 1-3) and can be put on the θ axis at the lattice

(“catalytic”) sites with spacing 2π/3, as shown in the right panels of Figs. 2 and 3. The

dimensionless periodic (with period 2π) potential U(θ) [not necessary of the form (1)] is

supposed to be “rigidly tied” to this lattice, so that its minima are always found at sites

with state T. We assume this potential to satisfy the normalization conditions: U(T)= 0

3

and U(D)= 1. The last constarint means that the potential energy of the eﬀective particle

in state D is equal to the free hydrolysis energy W .

Consider ﬁrst the hydrolysis direction when F1 operates as a motor (see Fig. 2). Let

initially the γ subunit (rotor) be found at equilibrium, performing there thermal ﬂuctuations.

This state is represented by spring K1 being undistorted and switched on state T, while

the springs at the other sites (K2 and K3) are switched oﬀ. In the particle equivalent, this

situation is represented in the right panel of Fig. 2(a) by a particle ﬂuctuating in the vicinity

of one of the minima of the potential U(θ), i.e., in state T. When an ATP molecule settles into

site 2 which is found at this time in state E, it appears bound there, resulting in ATP binding:

E

T. According to the rotary binding-change mechanism [13,14], this transition implies

→

the two conformational changes at the next two sites: release of the inorganic phosphate

(P) and the ADP (adenosinediphosphate) molecule from site 2 (D

E), and hydrolysis of

→
D). After these state transitions have occured,

the ATP molecule located at site 3 (T

→

spring K1 is switched oﬀ, while spring K2 is switched on, causing the power stroke on the

rotor as demonstrated by Fig. 2(b). Therefore the rotor is driven forward before it reaches

a new equilibrium state, stepping forward by 2π/3. Correspondingly, as shown in the right

panel, the potential U(θ) steps forward (to the right) by 2π/3, so that the particle appears

to be lifted uphill at the level U = 1, thereafter sliding down and ﬁnally dwelling in the

next potential minimum before the next sequence of conformational changes takes place.

However, if occasionally two sequential conformational transitions occur very close in time

resulting in two almost simultaneous potential steps forward, the particle appears on the

positive slope of the potential U(θ), sliding thereafter down backwards. When the time

between two sequential transitions is still short, but long enough for the particle to make

a descent close to equilibrium, the double potential step forward will result in the double

sliding down on the negative slope. Indeed, both such occasional steps of γ loaded by an

actin ﬁlament were observed in experiments [16,18,19]. We denote the sequence of time

instants when hydrolysis events occur by

∞
i=1 and call it a “hydrolysis sequence”.

Consider now the case, when an external torque (e.g., from the side of F0) is applied to

t+

{

the γ subunit clockwise, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 3(a). According to Cherepanov et

al. and Junge et al. [15], the external energy of torsion is stored as an elastic strain energy of

γ. When the rotator turns clockwise totally by 2π/3, the torsional energy is liberated for the

synthesis of one ATP molecule at the site being in state D. Then spring K1 is switched oﬀ,

while spring K3 is on, bringing the system to the zero-energy level (U = 0). Equivalently, the

particle “drops down” to equilibrium state T [see Fig. 3(b)]. These mechanical equivalents

are again in accordance with Boyer [13] for ATP synthesis, when the conformational change

D

T implies the transitions at the other two sites: T

E and E

D. We denote the

sequence of time instants when synthesis events occur by

{

Summarizing, one can present the diagram shown in Fig. 4, which describes the elastic

strain energy of the torsional rotor-stator interaction as a function of θ, combining both the

hydrolysis and synthesis directions. Arrows show the rotational direction under hydrolysis

(θ > 0, motor regime) and synthesis (θ < 0, synthesizer regime).

In experiments [16,18,19], the γ subunit was loaded by an actin ﬁlament rotating in a vis-

cous solution. Therefore, we approach the overdamped limit and the equation of motion for

the rotator driven by a periodic potential U(θ) ﬂuctuating stepwise forward and backwards

by 2π/3 (due to hydrolysis power strokes and an external load torque

(4)

where each ζi

[0, 1] is a random value with uniform distribution (since ATP concentration

∈

is supposed to be constant in the solution). The interval ∆tT is large for low [ATP], but

tends to zero as [ATP] is suﬃciently high. Therefore one can assume that ∆tT = AT/[ATP]

with some constant AT > 0. The interval ∆tD triggers the hydrolysis reactions by release of

P and ADP on the next site of the stator. In the limit of low concentration of nucleotides

(ATP and ADP), this interval is short, whereas for high concentration, the release of the

hydrolysis products is impeded and therefore some saturation for ∆tD takes place. As a

result, one can assume that ∆tD = ∆tst[ATP]/(CD + [ATP]) with some constant CD > 0

and ∆tst being the duration time of one step. At zero temperature, it follows from the over-

damped dynamics governed by Eq. (2) that ∆tst → ∞
a potential minimum after an inﬁnitely long time). However, at nonzero temperature, the

(an overdamped particle approaches

the constant KM = AT/∆tst can be identiﬁed as the Michaelis constant, because Eq. (5)

is reduced to the Michaelis-Menten law in the limit CD →
[16], KM = 0.8 µM and Vmax = 4 s−1, and for these values the dependence (5) is shown in

0. According to Yasuda et al.

Fig. 5 (including the experimental data), with monotonic behavior for CD ≤
[16], one can assume that the one-step duration depends on the length of the ﬁlament L as

KM. Similarly

∆tst

As described above, for a given random hydrolysis sequence (4), each synthesis instant

t−
j

is deﬁned as the time when the rotor, being at some time in state T, rotates backwards

by 2π/3. Direct simulations of the dimensionless (τ = t/t0) equation (2) with the potential

(1) are presented in Fig. 7. Here the intervals ∆τD,T = ∆tD,T/t0 in the sequence (4) are given

through the constants CD and KM, as well as the parameter ∆τst = ∆tst/t0 = W/3ΓVmax to

be evaluated from experiments. Thus, using that Γ(L = 1 µm)

Ref. [16]) and the law plotted in Fig. 5 at CD = KM, where the two velocities shown with

dotted lines 1 and 2 correspond to curves 1 and 2 in Fig. 7, respectively. Note that the

constant CD in Eq. (5) implicitly describes the main feature of trajectories at low [ATP] (see

curve 2): on average the number of multi-steps exceeds that of steps backwards, as observed

experimentally [18,16]. Next, when a load torque

l > 0 is applied, the rotational rate

T

decreases with increase of this torque, as illustrated by curve 3 in Fig. 7. Moreover, when

the load exceeds some threshold value, the motor operates in inverse, as shown by curves 4

and 5. Similarly to Lattanzi and Maritan [8], the law (5) can be modiﬁed by subtracting a

positive constant that controls the direction of rotation if

l > 0.

T

Thus, we have developed two (rotator and one-particle) physical models of archetypal

7

simplicity, which are consistent with the rotary binding-change mechanism [13,14] and the

elasticity properties of the γ subunit [15]. The cooperative rotational catalysis at the three

β subunits is described through two time sequences, each for switching hydrolysis and syn-

thesis reactions, by adjusting the statistics of switching to satisfy the recent experimental

results [18,16]. The models described in this paper are generic and simple; they do not

depend on details of the periodic potential U(θ). In the hydrolysis (motor) direction, the γ

subunit works in a “passive” regime; only all the β subunits are coordinated in the cooper-

ative rotational catalysis. In the reversible (synthesis) direction, γ is “active”, causing the

corresponding (again cooperative, but in the inverse sequence) conformational changes after

its strain energy of torsion reaches the free ATP hydrolysis energy. These important fea-

tures are consistent with both Boyer’s binding-change mechanism [13,14] and the ﬁndings of

Cherepanov et al. and Junge et al. [15]. The dependences of the model parameters on ATP

concentration are general and physically motivated. In the framework of our description,

the load torque

l(θ, t) generated by the F0 part can further be involved explicitly resulting

T

in a general motor/pump model of ATP synthase.

We also conclude that the puzzle, how does the binding-change mechanism work, may

be essential not only for understanding the chemistry (dissipative catalysis) of creation of

ATP, one of the most important processes in life, but also constitute a key physical problem

behind the function of molecular motors, such as design of man-made molecular devices.

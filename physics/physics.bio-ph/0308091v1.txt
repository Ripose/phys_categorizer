Group theoretical concepts are invoked in a speciﬁc model to explain how only twenty amino acids

occur in nature out of a possible sixty four. The methods we use enable us to justify the occurrence

of the recently discovered twenty ﬁrst amino acid selenocysteine, and also enables us to predict the

possible existence of two more, as yet undiscovered amino acids.

Introduction

The genetic code uses four “letters” or the bases adenine(A), thymine(T), guanine(G) and cyto-

sine(C) in the four nucleotides constituting the DNA (or uracil(U) in the corresponding RNA template)

by reading them in groups of three. A and G are purine bases while C and T are pyrimidines. Like

T, U pairs with A. During protein synthesis, these triplets of three bases (or codons) encode for

speciﬁc amino acids. The genetic code however, is degenerate, and even though there are 64 possible

codons, only 20 amino acids relevant to mammalian proteins actually occur in nature. It has remained

intriguing that despite the redundancy of the codons, the genetic code did not expand any further

and stopped at the number 20.

It is therefore of interest to ﬁnd out if the genetic code has any

mathematical property which gets optimised when the number of codons becomes nearly thrice the

number of the amino acids. We attempt here to answer this question by adapting some standard group

theoretical methods of particle physics to molecular biology. The genetic code is nearly the same for

all organisms — non-canonical genetic codes are used in mitochondria and some protozoa [1]. Here, we

consider only the universal genetic code.

Out of the 64 possible codons, it is now known that 61 code for the known 20 amino acids — the

remaining three (UAG, UGA, and UAA) code for termination or “stop” codons. The codon AUG

for methionine also codes for the initiation of the translation process, and is therefore also called the

“start” codon. It was discovered some years back that one of the stop codons, UGA, translates under

certain circumstances to a twenty ﬁrst amino acid selenocysteine [2]. It is certainly conceivable, that

the other two stop codons UAG and UAA similarly code also for some as yet undiscovered amino acids.

Our approach is a semi-empirical one, but it enables us to not only justify the occurrence of selenocys-

teine, but it allows us also to predict the possible existence of two more, new, as yet undiscovered amino

acids. We look at the hydrophilic and hydrophobic tendencies of the amino acid residues constitut-

ing the proteins, as they play a key role in determining the conformation of a protein and the way it folds.

The idea of using group theoretical techniques in studying the genetic code is not new — references

[4] deal in length with searches for symmetries among Lie groups for trying to explain codon degeneracy

in the genetic code.

In their very interesting papers, the authors of

[4] view the universal genetic

code as having evolved through a chain of successively broken symmetry events, from a primordial

amino acid having a particular symmetry (which they assume to be Sp(6)). Their approach, however,

does not presently account for the twenty ﬁrst amino acid selenocysteine having properties similar to

cysteine.

We approach the problem from a diﬀerent point of view : we have tried to show that it is possible to

classify the 64 possible codons into well-deﬁned multiplets — the hydropathic properties of the amino

acids they code for are determined by the multiplet they belong to. Our approach has also a predictive

power (presently lacking in the papers in [4]), enabling one to approximately predict certain properties

of two other possible, as yet undiscovered amino acids.

2. The role of codons in protein synthesis

Protein synthesis is initiated by a process called transcription in which the cell makes a copy of the

gene — a messenger RNA (or mRNA) template, from the DNA with the help of an enzyme called RNA

polymerase [1, 5]. Transcription stops when the enzyme reaches a “stop” sequence at the end of the

gene, upon which the mRNA dissociates from the DNA, moves to the cytoplasm and gets attached at its

Shine-Dalgarno sequence to a ribosomal RNA (rRNA) located within the ribosome. In the cytoplasm,

transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules form complexes called aminoacyl-tRNAs with their respective amino

acids, in a process driven by the enzymes aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. An aminoacylated tRNA moves

to the ribosome where its anticodon recognizes its corresponding complementary codon of the mRNA

and incorporates the amino acid residue at the correct position speciﬁed by the mRNA codons into

a growing peptide chain of the protein, this process being called translation. The folds governing the

conformation of a protein are thus determined by its primary structure — the sequence of the amino

acids in the peptide chain, which in turn depend upon the sequence of codons in the functionally mature

mRNA and the exon sequences in the DNA.

3. Group theoretical methods for Codons

Keeping all of the above complex dynamics in mind, one could still try to look for any possible

symmetries in the system, and see whether a much-simpliﬁed, minimal mathematical model for the

codons could capture any of the physics and biochemistry of the actual biological system.

To begin with, we ﬁrst recall the basic chemical structure of an amino acid. It has a central carbon

called the α-carbon which is attached to four groups — a hydrogen atom, an acidic carboxyl (–COOH)

group, a basic amino (–NH2) group and a distinct side chain (–R) group — this last group essentially

determines its chemical properties.

The amino acids we know, can be classiﬁed into two broad categories on the basis of their

solubilities in water : hydrophobic and hydrophilic. At pH 7.0, hydrophobic (non-polar) –R groups

are contained by alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine,

cysteine and glycine. Hydrophilic side chains are polar, so that they can be further classiﬁed as

acidic, basic or neutral, depending upon their charges — at pH 7.0, lysine, arginine and histidine

have basic side-chains, aspartate and glutamate are acidic and there are those which have polar but

neutral side-chains: asparigine, glutamine, serine, threonine and tyrosine. Yet another consideration

for classiﬁcation of amino acids could be on the basis of whether the side chains are aliphatic or aromatic.

The categories or multiplets into which the amino acids fall, appear to reﬂect certain underlying

internal symmetries. We know that while the base triplets (codons) do not constitute the amino acids,

the base sequence within each codon dictates the identiﬁcation of and translation to a particular amino

acid. We can therefore hypothesise that the bases possess certain basic symmetries.

We look for the properties of the system which do not change or only approximately change in time,

and the symmetries associated with the conserved quantities.

Let T (a) represent a group of transformations which leave the Hamiltonian H of the physical system

invariant. We assume that the transformations are represented by unitary operators U (a), (‘a’ denoting

a parameter of the transformation) operating on a complex vector space [6]. The eigenvalue equation

where φn is an eigenfunction of H with energy eigenvalue En. Operating on this with U (a), one obtains

for the system would be:

Hφn = Enφn

:

where we have let

U Hφn = U HU

U φn = EnU φn

−1

or

′

′
φ

′
n = Enφ

n

H

= U HU

−1

and

′
φ

n = U φn

Since U leaves the Hamiltonian invariant :

H ′ = H ,

the state φ′

n has the same energy as the

state φn. Operating on φn with U (b),

‘b’ being another parameter, would give another eigenstate of

H with the same energy En. The states which one obtains by operating with all U on a given state

can be expressed as linear combinations of a set of basis vectors spanning the subspace of eigenstates

of H with a given energy.

In general these vectors are the basis vectors of an irreducible represen-

tation and denote a set of states called a multiplet. All states of a multiplet are degenerate in the energy.

These basic techniques can be used to develop a symmetry scheme for the nucleotides and the codons.

A and G can be regarded as diﬀerent states of the same object, the purine, described by a state vector

in an abstract, complex vector space, and similarly, C and T /U as diﬀerent states of a pyrimidine. The

purine and the pyrimidine state vectors are then each, two-component matrices :

ψR =

and

ψY =







C





T




or



C






U




where ψR and ψY denote the purine and pyrimidine state vectors respectively. A unitary transforma-

tion U (Λ) which involves a rearrangement of the components, but which leaves the magnitude ( ¯ψiψi)

(i = R, Y ) invariant can be written as:

′
i = U (Λ)ψi

ψ

(4)

Transition mutations involving replacement of one purine by another purine, or one pyrimidine by

another pyrimidine can be represented by (4). The states representing A and G could be taken to

correspond respectively to ‘up’ and ‘down’ states of ψR, with respect to a chosen axis in the internal

vector space. A state intermediary between these two states could be regarded as a superposition of

the two states, with the state having the larger probability measure, having the higher possibility of

becoming the ﬁnal state of the mutation. Proceeding similarly, we can deﬁne the full system of all the

four bases by a four-component vector φi (i = 1, . . . , 4) :

where I k are ‘k’ number of 4 × 4 matrices, and are representations of the generators of the transfor-

mation group, changes the state of the nucleotide system, but not the total number of nucleotides.

Transversion mutations in which a purine is replaced by a pyrimidine, or vice-versa, are also covered

by the transformation (5).

Since there are four diﬀerent kinds of bases out of which three together code for one amino acid,

we view the amino acids as arising out of “3-base” representations of the group SU(4). The purine

and pyramidine bases are both hydrophobic and are turned inwards in the DNA structure. The

four bases are distinguished by three conserved numbers (which we denote by J1, J2 and J3 (which

reﬂects the rank 3 of the SU(4) group). This collection of four states serves as the basis vectors for a

fundamental representation of SU(4). A model with four bases could certainly correspond to a com-

pletely diﬀerent symmetry group and not necessarily SU(4) — we consider however, this possibility only.

The base triplets formed from the Kronecker product of three fundamental representations of SU(4),

and arranged in the diﬀerent multiplets (which are the decompositions of the product) represent at

those positions, the amino acids they code for :

4 ⊗ 4 ⊗ 4 = 20S ⊕ 20M ⊕ 20M ⊕ ¯4

(6)

where 4 is the fundamental representation of SU(4), ¯4 is the conjugate representation, and the

subscripts S and M denote states which are formed from the symmetric combinations and the mixed

symmetry combinations, respectively, of the product tensors.

Each multiplet is the realization of an irreducible representation of SU (4), and because the members

of each have masses which are not exactly, but only nearly degenerate, the SU (4) symmetry is only an

approximate symmetry. Notice that the total codon count of 64 is respected, but now the codons are

grouped in separate multiplets. Each multiplet has a characteristic property which is shared by all its

Since the bases do not themselves constitute the amino acids, it follows that though the Ji (i = 1, . . . 3),

are conserved numbers for the codons, they need not necessarily be additively conserved for the

Kronecker product, since the permutations of the bases within a triplet only code to diﬀerent amino

members.

acids.

We ﬁnd that when we group together the amino acids into four categories: hydrophobic, weakly

hydrophobic, hydrophilic and imino, and then try to adapt the SU(4) quantum numbers [7, 8] for the

quark triplets (baryons) to the codons, they fall beautifully into well-deﬁned categories, as follows.

The numbers Ji we have assigned for the base triplets are shown in Tables 1–3 , within the

standard format of the Universal Genetic Code. The alphabets within brackets in these tables are

the conventional one-letter abbreviations for the various amino acids. The left-hand column stands

for the base present at the ﬁrst (5’) position of the codon, the top row denotes that in the second

(middle) position of the codon, and the right-hand side column indicates the one present in the third

(3’) position of the codon.

The 3-dimensional plots of J1, J2 and J3 for all the codons are shown in Figures 1–4. Except for the

case of proline (P), all the codons coding for a particular amino acid share the same J3 number.

All the amino acids in Fig.1 are hydrophobic, and all in Fig.3 are polar and hydrophilic. It is of

course well-known that there exist several diﬀerent hydrophobicity scales, and there is no unique

assignment of clear-cut hydrophobicity values for amino acids [9]. The amino acids in Fig.1, are, in

general, widely accepted to be more hydrophobic than the others. We have classiﬁed proline (P)

separately, as a realization of the conjugate ¯4 representation of SU(4), although it is very hydrophobic,

since it is technically an imino (– NH) acid rather than an amino (– NH2) acid, as its side chain is

bonded to the nitrogen as well as to the central α - carbon.

The amino acids cysteine (C),threonine (T), alanine (A), tryptophan (W), serine (S) and tyrosine

(Y) in Fig.2 have been classiﬁed as weakly hydrophobic — in fact some of them are slightly hydrophilic

— in some hydrophobicity scales, S and Y are categorized as being hydrophilic.

Notice that among the hydrophilic amino acids (hystidine (H), arginine (R), lysine (K), asparigine (N),

glutamine (Q), aspartic acid (D), & glutamic acid (E) ), H, R and K are basic and occur with higher

J3 values than the acidic amino acids (D,E).

It is interesting to note that in our model, of the nine essential amino acids which are required for

protein synthesis by adult humans, two (H and K) represent the hydrophilic multiplet, two (T and W )

represent the weakly hydrophobic multiplet, while all the amino acids except glycine (G) (methionine

(M), isoleucine(I), leucine (L), valine (V) and phenylalanine (F)) in the hydrophobic multiplet are

essential.

In general, the amino acids which have closer similarities between themselves, occur nearer to each

other within each multiplet. The amino acids in each multiplet are also in close conformity with the

standard suggested amino acid substitutions based on the Dayhoﬀ matrix [? ] wherein amino acid

residues which are near to each other in the Dayhoﬀ plot are good candidates for mutual exchange for

conservative mutations in proteins.

It is extremely interesting that with the assignment of the Ji numbers as in Tables 1–3, the codon

UGA which usually codes for “Stop”, falls in the multiplet of weakly hydrophobic amino acids, and

has the same J3 value of 2 as cysteine (C). UGA codes also for the newly discovered twenty ﬁrst amino

acid selenocysteine (SeC) — the sulfur atom in C is replaced by selenium in SeC.

On the basis of these observations, one could similarly predict the existence of two more as yet

undiscovered amino acids — the codons UAG and UAA which are presently known to code only for

the “Stop” signal. One could hypothesise that if UAG were to code for a new (twenty second) amino

acid, then that would have properties similar to H, and similarly, UAA if coded for a twenty third

amino acid would have properties similar to K or R, even though these two codons, both diﬀer from Y

only at the wobble position.

In our symmetry scheme for codons, we have not yet found it possible to assign Ji numbers for each

base individually so as to give additively, the total Ji numbers for each base triplet coding for the

amino acids, in a consistent way. This is not unreasonable, since as emphasised before, the bases do

not constitute the amino acids.

Synonymous codons occur at diﬀerent frequencies even though they all code for the same amino acid.

Correspondingly, the tRNA molecule for the codon used more, occurs in larger amounts than its isoac-

ceptors. This fact is reﬂected in the diﬀering J1 and J2 values for synonymous codons. The probability

for the occurrence of a particular synonymous codon would be weighted by Ji dependent factors in the

corresponding partition function and its free energy.

Thus, the occurrence of only twenty one amino acids out of a possible sixty four, can be explained in a

satisfactory manner within our scheme.

Discussion

We have classiﬁed the 64 codons within a semi-empirical model which very closely resembles the

decomposition of the Kronecker product 4 ⊗ 4 ⊗ 4 of SU(4), after assuming that bases A, C, G and

T /U can be regarded as diﬀerent states of a vector in an abstract, complex vector space. We represent

transition and transversion mutations involving replacement of purines and pyramidines, by rotations

through an angle in this internal space. Our model explains the existence of synonymous codons (thus

explaining how twenty one amino acids (including selenocysteine) have been found to occur so far

out of a possible sixty four). It also enables us to predict the possible existence of two more, as yet

undiscovered amino acids.

The stability of a fully folded native protein structure is a consequence of a balance between the

hydropathies of the constituent amino acid residues in its primary structure, electrostatic interactions

and hydrogen bonding. It would thus be a useful exercise to incorporate the ideas in this paper in

an analytical manner to approach the protein folding problem, since incorporation of all the internal

symmetries into the partition function is essential to get the correct form of the free energy of the

system.

Our ideas and methods could also be very useful in providing a rigorous mathematical basis for studying

DNA replication and protein synthesis using quantum algorithms.

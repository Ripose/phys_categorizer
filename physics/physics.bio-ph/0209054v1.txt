The Kirchhoﬀ model describes the statics and dynamics of thin rods within the approximations
of the linear elasticity theory. In this paper we develop a method, based on a shooting technique,
to ﬁnd equilibrium conﬁgurations of ﬁnite rods subjected to boundary conditions and given load
parameters. The method consists in making a series of small changes on a trial solution satisfying
the Kirchhoﬀ equations but not necessarily the boundary conditions. By linearizing the diﬀerential
equations around the trial solution we are able to push its end point to the desired position, step by
step. The method is also useful to obtain conﬁgurations of rods with ﬁxed end points but diﬀerent
mechanical parameters, such as tension, components of the moment or inhomogeneities.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The study of conformations of slender elastic rods is of substantial utility in several applications, ranging from the
ﬁelds of structural mechanics and engineering to biochemistry and biology. Examples are the study of coiling and
loop formation of sub-oceanic cables [1, 2, 3, 4], ﬁlamentary structures of biomolecules [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] and bacterial
ﬁbers [10, 11], the phenomenon of helix hand reversal in climbing plants [12] and the shape and dynamics of cracking
whips [13].

The Kirchhoﬀ model [14] provides a powerful approach to study the statics and dynamics of elastic thin rods [8, 15].
In this model the rod is described by a set of nine partial diﬀerential equations (the Kirchhoﬀ equations) in the time
and arclength of the rod. They contain the forces and torques plus a triad of vectors describing the deformations of
the rod. These equations are the result of Newton’s second law for the linear and angular momentum applied to the
thin rod plus a linear constitutive relationship between moments and strains. The Kirchhoﬀ model holds true in the
approximation of small curvatures of the rod, as compared to the radius of the local cross section [16]. An interesting
characteristic of this model, known as Kirchhoﬀ kinetic analogy, is that the equations governing the static problem
are formally equivalent to the Euler equations describing the motion of spinning tops in a gravity ﬁeld. The Kirchhoﬀ
equations for equilibrium conﬁgurations can, therefore, be written in hamiltonian form.

The Kirchhoﬀ equations have been solved for a number of simple situations. Shi and Hearst[7] ﬁrst obtained
analytical solutions of the equilibrium equations and, recently, Nizzete and Goriely [17] completed the study by
making a classiﬁcation of all kinds of equilibrium solutions. Goriely and Tabor [18, 19] developed a method to study
the dynamical stability of these solutions and Fonseca and de Aguiar [20] applied this method to study the near
equilibrium dynamics of non-homogeneous closed rods in viscous media. Recently, Tobias et al. [21] developed the
necessary and suﬃcient criteria for elastic stability of equilibrium conﬁgurations of closed rods.

In many cases of interest, including biological molecules, the ﬁlaments are subject to boundary conditions. Examples
are the problem of multiprotein structures, such as histones and gyrase, about which long pieces of DNA wrap [22],
and multiprotein structures, such as the lac repressor complex [23]. Despite the many achievements described above,
the study of the boundary value problem (BVP) associated with Kirchhoﬀ ﬁlaments is still a big challenge. While
the integration of diﬀerential equations from initial conditions is a relatively simple numerical task, the diﬃculties of
ﬁnding solutions for given boundary conditions are well known in classical mechanics, electromagnetism and quantum
mechanics. Typical examples are classical trajectories connecting two given space points in the time t, electric
potentials that vanish at given surfaces and eigenvalues of the Laplace operator deﬁned inside a ﬁnite domain (quantum
billiards).

Because of the analogy with spinning tops, the case of trajectories of Hamiltonian systems is of particular interest
here. The monodromy method, developed by Baranger and Davis [24], was designed speciﬁcally to ﬁnd periodic
solutions of Hamiltonian systems with N degrees of freedom. Xavier and de Aguiar [25] extended the method to ﬁnd

non-periodic trajectories with any given combination of 2N position and momenta at initial and/or ﬁnal times.

A widely used method to solve BVPs is the so called shooting method [26, 27]. For a single second-order diﬀerential
equation, the method consists in ﬁnding the proper ’velocity’ at the initial point so as to reach the desired ’target’ at the
end point, similar to the shooting of a projectile. Examples of applications of this method to the Kirchhoﬀ equations
are the search for homoclinic orbits in reversible systems [28], heteroclinic orbits resembling tendril pervesions [29]
and the study of localized buckling modes of thin elastic ﬁlaments [30, 31].

In the case of open rods some speciﬁc BVPs were solved recently. K´arolyi and Domokos [32], using symbolic
dynamics, found global invariants for BVPs of elastic linkages, as natural discretization of continuous elastic beams,
an old problem solved by Euler(see reference [32]). Gottlieb and Perkins [33] investigated spatially complex forms
in a BVP governing the equilibrium of slender cables subjected to thrust, torsion and gravity. Also, the criteria of
Tobias et al. [21] was applied to linear segments subjected to strong anchoring end conditions, where not only the
end points but also the tangent vector at the end points are held ﬁxed. The dependence of DNA tertiary structure
on end conditions was studied in [22], where explicit expressions for equilibrium conﬁgurations were obtained for a
speciﬁc case with symmetric end conditions.

Our aim in this paper is to develop a method to ﬁnd equilibrium solutions of ﬁnite rods subjected to boundary
conditions at their end points and with given load parameters. We emphasize that this is diﬀerent from the approach
in [30, 31], where the authors use shooting methods to calculate localized buckling modes. These modes are treated
as homoclinic solutions of the Kirchhoﬀ equations, corresponding to inﬁnite rods that become asymptotically straight
in the inﬁnite. Our objective is to ﬁnd equilibrium solutions for ﬁnite rods subjected to boundary conditions at both
ends.

Our method is an adaptation of the monodromy matrix method for non-periodic trajectories [25] to the hamiltonian
formulation of the static Kirchhoﬀ equations. We work with the Kirchhoﬀ equations directly in Euler angles, instead
of using the Cartesian position and tangent vectors [30, 31]. The diﬃculty in working with Euler angles is that the
variables that one wants to hold ﬁxed, the spatial position of the ﬁlament end points, are not the variables appearing
in the diﬀerential equations describing the rod. However, the number of diﬀerential equations to be solved is much
smaller in these variables. Using a symmetry of the Hamiltonian, we end up with only two independent equations to
solve.

One of the motivations of this work is its possible biological applications as, for example, the study of single DNA
molecules manipulated by optical traps [34, 35, 36], and the DNA loops between multiprotein structures (such as the
lac repressor-operator complex) [37, 38].

This work is organized as follows. In Sec. II we review the Kirchhoﬀ equations and, in Sec. III, their hamiltonian
formulation. In Sec. IV we describe our method for solving the BVP. The monodromy method enters as part of
the solution, and proves to be a very eﬃcient tool. In Sec. V we give numerical examples, calculating the three
dimensional conﬁguration of rods with diﬀerent sets of load parameters and end positions. We also discuss the
existence of solutions as function of the load parameters. In Sec. VI, motivated by the repeated sequences of base-
pairs commonly found in DNA molecules, we consider rods with periodically varying Young modulus. We compare
the conﬁgurations of these non-homogeneous rods against their homogeneous counterparts, ﬁxing the same end points
and mechanical parameters. In Sec. VII we summarize our conclusions.

II. THE KIRCHHOFF EQUATIONS

The Kirchhoﬀ model describes the dynamics of inextensible thin elastic ﬁlaments within the approximation of linear
elasticity theory [16]. They result from the application of Newton’s laws of mechanics to a thin rod, and consist of two
equations describing the balance of linear and angular momentum plus a constitutive relationship of linear elasticity
theory, relating moments to strains. The Kirchhoﬀ model assumes that the ﬁlament is thin and weakly bent (i.e. its
cross-section radius is much smaller than its length and its curvature at all points). In this approximation it is possible
to derive a one-dimensional theory where forces and moments are averaged over the cross-sections perpendicular to
the central axis of the ﬁlament.

A thin tube can be described by a smooth curve x in the 3D space parametrized by the arclength s, and whose
position depends on the time: x = x(s, t). A local orthonormal basis, (or director basis) di = di(s, t), i = 1, 2, 3, is
deﬁned at each point of the curve, with d3 chosen as the tangent vector, d3 = x′. In this paper we shall use primes to
denote diﬀerentiation with respect to s and dots to denote diﬀerentiation with respect to time. The two orthonormal
vectors, d1 and d2, lie in the plane normal to d3, for example along the principal axes of the cross section of the rod.
These vectors are chosen such that {d1, d2, d3} form a right-handed orthonormal basis for all values of s and t. The
space and time evolution of the director basis along the curve are controlled by twist and spin equations

which follow from the orthonormality relations di · dj = δij . The components of k and ω in the director basis are

i=1 ωidi. k1 and k2 are the components of the curvature and k3 is the twist
deﬁned as k =
density of the rod. The solution of the twist and spin equations determines d3(s, t), which can be integrated to give
the space curve x(s, t).

Let the material points on the rod be labeled by

where

X(s, t) = x(s, t) + r(s, t),

r(s, t) = x1 d1(s, t) + x2 d2(s, t)

gives the position of the point on the cross section S(s), perpendicular to x′(s), with respect to the central axis. The
total force F = F(s, t) and the total moment M = M(s, t) (with respect to the axis of the rod) on the cross section
are deﬁned by

F =

M =

where ps is the contact force per unit area exerted on the cross section S(s). In terms of the director basis we write
F =

In order to derive a set of equations describing the rod as a one-dimensional object, the rod is divided into thin disks
of length ds and cross section S(s). To each of these disks the conservation laws of linear and angular momentum are
applied [16]. The result is

where fext is an external force that will not be considered in our calculations (fext = 0 in what follows).

In this article we are interested only in the equilibrium solutions and, therefore, we shall drop the derivatives with
respect to time. Assuming that the rod has a uniform circular cross section of area A, Eqs. (6) and (7) can be
simpliﬁed to yield

which are a set of six equations for 9 variables: F, M and k (from which we determine di). In order to close the
system of equations we need a constitutive relation relating the local forces and moments (stresses) to the elastic
deformations of the body (strains). In the linear theory of elasticity, and for a homogeneous elastic material, the
stress is proportional to the deformation. The Young’s modulus E and the Shear modulus µ characterize the elastic
properties of the material. Therefore, it is possible to obtain, for small deformations, a constitutive relation for the
moment. For a isotropic material, in the director basis, this relation is [16]:

M = EI (k1 − ku

1 ) d1 + EI (k2 − ku

2 ) d2 + 2µI (k3 − ku

3 ) d3,

(10)

where I is the principal moment of inertia of the cross section, ki are the components of the strain vector and ku
i
are the components of the twist vector in the unstressed conﬁguration. The case ku
i = 0 corresponds to a naturally
straight and untwisted rod. We shall assume ku

i = 0.

Eqs. (8), (9) and (10) can be further simpliﬁed by the introduction of scaled variables:

In the new variables the rod has total length L = 1. The static Kirchhoﬀ equations become

III. HAMILTONIAN FORMULATION

In order to construct a hamiltonian formulation of the Kirchhoﬀ equations we ﬁrst note that Eqs. (12)-(14) are
integrable if E and µ are constant [17]. Eq. (12) shows that the tension F is constant. Let us choose the direction of
the force as the z direction:

In analogy to the spinning top, the tension F corresponds to the gravity ﬁeld −mg. Here, F can be considered as an
external parameter and not as a ﬁrst integral. Substituting Eq. (15) in Eq. (13) and projecting along eZ we get

which does represent a ﬁrst integral. By projecting the Eq. (13) along d3 we obtain another integral, M3, since

Finally, it is also possible to show that the elastic energy per unit arclength

is constant, i.e., H ′ = 0. Therefore H is the last integral.

The orthonormal Cartesian basis can be connected to the director basis by Euler angles with

where

cos θ cos φ cos ψ − sin φ sin ψ
− cos θ sin φ cos ψ − cos φ sin ψ − cos θ sin φ sin ψ + cos φ cos ψ sin φ sin θ

The static Kirchhoﬀ equations (12)-(14) can then be written in terms of θ, φ and ψ. We get

θ′′ − (ψ′)2 sin θ cos θ + Γψ′(φ′ + ψ′ cos θ) sin θ = F sin θ
ψ′′ sin θ + 2ψ′θ′ cos θ − Γθ′(φ′ + ψ′ cos θ) = 0
ψ′′ cos θ = ψ′θ′ sin θ − φ′′

The total elastic energy of the rod can be calculated by the integration of the Eq. (22):

The energy is a function of Pψ, Pφ and F . It also depends on the initial conditions θ(s = 0) ≡ θ0 and Pθ(s = 0) ≡ Pθ0.
The procedure to construct equilibrium solutions for given constants Pψ and Pφ and initial condition (θ0, Pθ0) is
∂Pθ to obtain (θ(s), Pθ(s)). Second, using Eq. (25), we

as follows: ﬁrst we solve the equations P ′

IV. THE LINEARIZED METHOD

In this section we present our method for ﬁnding the conﬁguration of ﬁnite rods subject to boundary conditions in
the position of its initial and ﬁnal points. In fact, since the Kirchhoﬀ equations are invariant under space translations,
we can always choose the initial point be the origin. As we saw in the previous section, equilibrium solutions for the
static Kirchhoﬀ equations depend only on two initial conditions, namely, θ0 and Pθ0. The third initial condition, ψ0
corresponds to a rotation of this solution around the z-axis. The problem is then that of ﬁnding a solution that starts
f + x2
y2
f from the z-axis. Our method is based on a series
from the origin and ends at zf and at a distance rf ≡
of small deformations made upon an initial solution of the Kirchhoﬀ equations which, however, does not have the
desired boundary values for rf and zf . We call this initial solution the trial solution. The method consists in pushing
the end point of the trial solution to the desired position, step by step. The basic idea, which is a type of shooting
procedure, is to ﬁnd a variation in the initial conditions so as to obtain the desired variation in the end point.

q

In order to do so, we shall employ a variation of the Monodromy Method [24, 25], originally devised to calculate
periodic solutions of chaotic Hamiltonian systems. As discussed in the Introduction, working with the Kirchhoﬀ
equations in Euler angles poses an extra diﬃculty on the already hard problem of satisfying boundary conditions: the
variables to be held ﬁxed, rf and zf , are not the ones entering the equations of motion, namely, θ, Pθ and ψ. The
advantage is that we can ﬁnd the solutions solving only two diﬀerential equations.

The rod can be obtained from the Euler angles the equations (28), (29) and (30). The Euler angles, in their turn,

obey the equations

If we integrate Eqs.(33)-(35) using the initial condition provided by the trial solution and further integrate Eqs.(28)-
(30) with the resulting Euler angles, we get, of course, the trial rod. Variations in these initial conditions will produce
variations in the rod conﬁguration, and, in particular, in its end point. In what follows we shall construct an explicit
relation between a small variation in the initial variables θ0 and Pθ0 and the rod’s end point, represented by rf and
zf . Explicitly, we shall ﬁnd the matrix B such that

Once B is obtained (and if it can be inverted) we can work our way from the trial solution, whose end point is at,
say, rt and zt, to the desired end point at rf and zf , provided we do that in a series of small steps. In each step we
use the previous solution as the trial input, pushing the rod’s end point slowly towards its ﬁnal destination.

Using rf =

and, therefore, the matrix B,

Since we linearized the equations of motion, we have to check if the new solution, starting from θ1 = θ0 + δθ0 and
Pθ1 = P0 + δPθ0 generates a rod with the chosen ﬁnal point, within a given precision. If the precision is not reached,
we can use the newly computed solution as a new trial one, using again Eq. (36), now with (δrf , δzf ) corresponding
to the distance between the ﬁxed end point and the end point of the previously computed rod. The process can be
repeated until the desired accuracy is obtained.

Finally we note that the elements Mij(s) can be computed by solving the linear equations (46) with proper initial
conditions. Indeed, setting δθ0 = 1 and δPθ0 = 0, Eq. (48) gives M11(s) = δθ(s) and M21(s) = δPθ(s). If, on the
other hand, we set δθ0 = 0 and δPθ0 = 1 we get M12(s) = δθ(s) and M22(s) = δPθ(s). Therefore, M11(s) and M21(s)
are solutions of the linearized Eqs. (46) with the initial conditions δθ0 = 1 and δPθ0 = 0 and M12(s) and M22(s) are
the solutions of the same equations with δθ0 = 0 and δPθ0 = 1.

In many cases we might want to push the rod’s end-point to a position rf = (rf , zf ) far from that of the initial
trial solution, rt = (rt, zt). To do that we can divide the line connecting rt to rf into N small segments and apply the
linearized method N times, moving a small distance at each step. The number of steps required will depend on the
particular conﬁguration and possibly on the stability of the rod. In all integrations presented in this paper, we used
a fourth order Runge-Kuta method with ﬁxed step. In all cases the distance between the end-point of the trial rod
and the target position was divided into 10 segments and the solution converged to the desired boundary condition
with a precision of 10−6 in each component r and z.

Figure 1 shows a example of the method. We have chosen the following load parameters in scaled units (see Eq.
(11): Pψ = 1.0, Pφ = 1.0 and F = 1.0. The desired end point is rf = 0.7 and zf = 0.0. We plot the trial, an
intermediate and the converged rods together, in order to show the process of convergence from the trial to the
desired solution. The trial solution was computed integrating the Kirchhoﬀ equations starting from θ0 = 0.5 and
Pθ0 = 1.0, which corresponds to a rod whose ﬁnal point is rf ≃ 0.8 and zf ≃ 0.455. The intermediate solution was
computed from θ0 ≃ 0.216 and Pθ0 ≃ 2.257, which corresponds to a rod whose ﬁnal point is rf ≃ 0.73 and zf ≃ 0.15.
Finally, the initial conditions obtained for the converged solution are θ0 ≃ 0.307 and Pθ0 ≃ 2.510.

V. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES

The particular trial solution used in the previous numerical example converged smoothly to the chosen ﬁnal position.
In some cases, however, a given trial solution does not converge to its destination no matter how many intermediate
steps are used to divide the line between rt and rf . As we shall see, this problem has to do with the existence or not
of solutions for a given rf . In scaled units, it is obvious that there are no solutions if
f > 1. The restrictions
are actually much stronger than this simple ’length rule’, and depend on the values of Pφ, Pψ and F . It might also
happen that the solution for a given rf does exist, but that the straight line connecting rt to rf passes through
forbidden regions, hindering the convergence. In this section we investigate the space of possible solutions and give
several examples of rods computed with our method.

Each initial condition θ0 and Pθ0 leads to an end point rf . The easiest way to map all possible ﬁnal points is to scan
the space of initial conditions. Therefore, for a ﬁxed set of parameters Pψ, Pφ and F we calculate rf = rf (θ0, Pθ0)
and plot the resulting ﬁgure in the (rf , zf ) space. Points outside this region are unreachable by the rod. Changing the
parameters, such as the tension, changes the region of possible solutions, including end-points that were not previously
present and excluding others.

The results in this section are presented as follows: for each ﬁxed set of Pψ, Pφ and F we show the (rf , zf )-space
f and, for each D we compute the

of possible solutions. On the same plot we draw curves of constant D =
three dimensional conﬁguration of a few rods.

In order to compare the rods, we always adjust the value of ψ0 such that the rod ends in yf = 0 plane. ψ0 is

determined by:

Figure 2 shows the (rf , zf ) map for this case. The map was generated by varying the initial condition in the
intervals 0 < θ0 < π (30 points) and −5.0 < Pθ0 < 5.0 (200 points). For larger values of Pθ0 the total elastic energy
of the rod increases and the ﬁnal points tend to concentrate in the region near the origin (data not shown). The full
thick line represents the curve D = 1.0, which is the natural limit for the solutions. But there is a large region inside
the D = 1 line where no solutions exist. We shall compare it with that of other load parameters later on. We also
show the lines of constant D for D = 0.9 (full line), D = 0.7 (dashed line) and D = 0.4 (dotted-dashed line). It is also
interesting to note a forbidden region centered around zf ∼ 0 and rf ∼ 0.25. From the sequence of points crossing
each other, it is evident that there are two sets of initial conditions (θ0, Pθ0) that generate rods with the same end
point. In general they correspond to rods that are above or below the z axis, and we shall call them the ’up’ solution
and the ’down’ solution respectively.

Figure 3 shows examples of the rods whose end points are marked with circles in Fig. 2. We show the up and
down solutions for each ﬁnal point. Figs. 3a and 3b show three rods each for D = 0.4 and D = 0.7. Fig. 3c shows 5
diﬀerent rods for D = 0.9.

Notice that when Pφ or Pψ are zero, the hamiltonian (22), becomes symmetric under the transformation F → −F
and θ → π − θ. In these cases the ’up’ solution for a given F and θ0 is identical to the ’down’ solution for −F and
π − θ0. When both Pφ and Pψ are non-zero the symmetry disappears.

B. Pψ = 0, Pφ = 5 and F = 1

The (rf , zf ) map for these parameters is shown in Fig. 4. It has a curious pattern of thin bulbs centered around
the zf = 0 axis, that degenerate for small rf . The only rods possible in this case are those that return close to the
z = 0 plane.

Keeping Pψ = 0 and F = 1 but increasing Pφ results in even thiner bulbs. Figures 5 (a) and (b) show the up and
down solutions, respectively, for rf = 0.7, zf = 0 and Pφ = 1, 5 and 10. Panels (c) and (d) show the up and down
solutions for the same parameters, except for rf = 0.9. Notice that large values of Pφ correspond to horizontal helical
rods.

C. Pψ = Pφ and F = 1

Figure 6 shows the (rf , zf ) map for Pψ = Pφ = 5. It resembles the map on Fig. 4, only distorted towards zf = 1. For
these values of the parameters the rod admits ’vertical’ conﬁgurations, as opposed to the ’horizontal’ conﬁgurations
displayed in the previous case. Figures 7 show examples of rods with Pψ = Pφ = 5 and Pψ = Pφ = 10 for rf = 0.39
and rf = 0.5.

VI. APPLICATION TO NON-HOMOGENEOUS DNA

As a last application of our method we shall consider the equilibrium conﬁgurations of non-homogeneous rods. We
restrict ourselves to the simplest case of periodic non-homogeneities in Young’s modulus. The motivation for this
study is the fact that repeated (and therefore periodic) DNA sequences form a substantial fraction of all eukaryotic
genomes [39, 40]. The calculations presented here are based on the stiﬀness parameters recently computed for the
32 tri-nucleotide units from DNA data [41]. Our goal is to understand how much the equilibrium conﬁguration
of a non-homogeneous rod diﬀers from that of the homogeneous case when the rod is subject to ﬁxed mechanical
conditions.

Repetitive DNA is formed by nucleotide sequences of varying lengths and compositions. Repeated sequences,
reaching up to 100 megabasepairs of length [40], appear to have little or no functional role, and are commonly
regarded as “selﬁsh” or “junk” DNA [42]. We shall use a simple periodic formula for the (scaled) Young’s modulus
that covers most of the parameter interval spanned by the tri-nucleotides given in ref. [41]:

L is the period of the oscillations of the Young’s modulus along the DNA and α is a parameter that depends on the
speciﬁc sequence being repeated and that can not be greater than 0.66.

E(s) = 1 + α cos

s .

Eqs.(22)-(25) have to be slightly modiﬁed to include the non-constant Young’s and shear moduli. We obtain

H =

P 2
θ
2E(s)

P 2
φ
2Γ0µ(s)

+

(Pψ − Pφ cos θ)2
2E(s) sin2 θ

+ F cos θ,

with

Pθ = E(s)θ′,

Pφ ≡ M3 = Γ0µ(s)(φ′ + ψ′ cos θ),

Pψ ≡ MZ = E(s)ψ′ sin2 θ + Pφ cos θ.

The solutions do not depend on µ(s), since it does not enter in the diﬀerential equations for θ, Pθ and ψ. Notice
that these equations are not integrable if α 6= 0. Although Pψ and Pφ are still constants, the elastic energy per unit
arclength is not.

The method for solving the BVP for a non-homogeneous rod is the following: consider a solution extending from
the origin to rf with α = 0 and initial conditions θ0 and Pθ0. Now integrate the Kirchhoﬀ equations from the same
initial conditions but using Eq.(52) with α 6= 0. This new solution, whose end point is rf + δr, can be used as a trial
solution for the non-homogeneous rod. Using the method of section IV we push the rod back to rf .

Figure 8 shows the up and down solutions for load parameters F = 1, Pψ = 0, Pφ = 10, rf = 0.9 and zf = 0 for

the homogeneous rod (black curve) and a non-homogeneous rod with α = 0.66 and L = 0.1 (gray curve).

Finally, Figure 9 shows the eﬀect of changing the period of oscillations in Young’s modulus. We show the up and
down solutions for non-homogeneous rods with the same load parameters of the previous ﬁgure and α = 0.66. The
curves show rods for L = 0.1 (gray), L = 0.5 (thick black) and L = 0.65 (thin black). The changes in the three-
dimensional shape of the rods are evident for these values of load parameters. The sensitivity of the three-dimensional
shape to the base-pair sequences indicated that DNA repeats may have conformational roles.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we presented a general method to solve the boundary value problem (BVP) for ﬁnite Kirchhoﬀ
ﬁlaments. The method consists in making small changes to a known trial rod that satisﬁes the Kirchhoﬀ equations
but not necessarily the boundary conditions. We combine a shooting technique with the method of monodromy matrix
to push the end point of the trial solution to the desired position, step by step. By linearizing the Kirchhoﬀ equations
we obtain an explicit relation between a variation of the initial conditions (expressed in terms of Euler angles) and
the consequent variation of the rod’s end point.

The solutions of the BVP are limited by the physical constraints of the rod, such as the moments and tension.
A sketch of the allowed end points can be constructed by integrating the Kirchhoﬀ equations for a large number of
initial conditions. The regions of possible end points form complex ﬁgures reﬂecting the non-linear character of the
equations. The regions of existence of end points may serve as a guide to ﬁnd the appropriate load parameters needed
for a desired solution.

We presented several examples of rods with diﬀerent end positions at diﬀerent distances from the origin for various
sets of load parameters. In all cases the method worked very well and the BVP was solved with at least six signiﬁcant
ﬁgures in the values of rf and zf . We also applied the method to non-homogeneous, sequence-dependent, DNAs.
We modeled pieces of repeated sequences by a sinusoidal oscillation of the Young’s modulus. We showed that the
tri-dimensional structure of the DNA is indeed sensitive to the presence of such sequences, a property that has been
considered before [43] but studied only in terms of the DNA intrinsic curvature [44]. The eﬀect studied here may
contribute to other sequence-dependent properties that aﬀect the three-dimensional conformations of the DNA.

In vitro velocities of several cell types have been measured using computer controlled video mi-
croscopy, which allowed to record the cells’ trajectories over several days. On the basis of our large
data sets we show that the locomotion activity displays a universal exponential distribution. Thus,
motion resulting from complex cellular processes can be well described by an unexpected, but very
simple distribution function. A simple phenomenological model based on the interaction of various
cellular processes and ﬁnite ATP production rate is proposed to explain these experimental results.

Tissue cell migration [1] has been studied in a num-
ber of biological processes, including the development of
the nervous system [2], immune reactions [3] and tumor
spreading [4]. Beside the inherent biological importance,
cell locomotion plays a key role in a number of interesting
large scale pattern formation phenomena like cell sorting
[5–7], or aggregation of amoebae [8]. Although the be-
havior of swimming bacteria has been well studied [9] and
served as a basis to understand collective microbiological
phenomena [10], rather little is known about the basic
statistical features of eukaryotic cell migration on time
scales comparable to the time of the pattern formation
processes.

The locomotion of cells emerges from parallel cyclic
subprocesses including cell-attachment to and detach-
ment oﬀ the substrate, growth and collapse of ﬁlopo-
dia/lamellopodia, the dynamic maintenance of appropri-
ate cell surface composition and displacement of the cell
mass. This complexity suggests two consequences. On
one hand, strong correlation cannot be expected between
the actual cell velocity and the concentration of a single
(or a few) cell biological regulatory factor(s) [11]. On
the other hand, interacting complex units often results a
characteristic macroscopic behavior which can be under-
stood by mathematical models [5–8,10], thus some sort of
statistical regularities might be expected in the cellular
behavior as well.

In order to obtain data providing a basis for an exten-
sive statistical analysis we have developed a computer
controlled system which automatically collects data and
maintains the cell culture conditions in a chamber at-
tached to the microscope for several days. We found
that the locomotion activity displays an exponential dis-
tribution, i.e., in spite of the complex cellular processes,
the motion of a cell can be well described by a simple
universal distribution function. This observation can be
explained in terms of a phenomenological model based
on the competition of various cellular processes for the
ﬁnite free energy (ATP) resources.

With the aim of applying statistical approaches in the
study of cellular locomotory activity, long-term cell mi-

gration patterns were recorded in low-density monolayer
cultures (see Table 1). The cellular trajectories (Fig. 1)
were tracked using a computer controlled phase contrast
videomicroscope system. Due to a high degree of autom-
atization we could collect and analyze a large set of data
(about 100,000 cell positions), signiﬁcantly exceeding the
amount of information evaluated in previous works on
cell motility [2,6,7,15–19].

Average velocities were calculated over a time period
of one hour (t0) as vi(t) = |~xi(t + t0/2) − ~xi(t − t0/2)|/t0,
where the location of the ith cell at time t is denoted by
~xi(t). Remarkable ﬂuctuations were found in the loco-
motion activity of individual cells, a phenomenon which
has also been reported in living slices of developing cortex
[2], in vitro migration of neurons [20] and ﬁbroblasts [15].
The characteristic time scale of the ﬂuctuations was esti-
mated to be a few hours, a value similar to that reported
for ﬁbroblasts [15].

Due to the low cell density, most cells migrated freely,
but the eﬀects of various cell interactions could be also
investigated. Since it is known that high cell density can
signiﬁcantly decrease the cell locomotion activity [21],
we investigated whether the observed velocity ﬂuctua-
tions were caused by changes in local intercellular connec-
tions. Cell to cell contacts were identiﬁed on the images
and the locomotion velocities vi(t) were sorted into two
sets (“solitary” / “interacting”) depending on whether
the cell in question had or had not visually observable
contacts with other cells. Cumulative velocity distribu-
tion functions F (v) were calculated for time periods of
20 hours giving the probability of the relation vi(t) < v
to hold for a randomly selected cell i and a random time
t. Comparing F (v) of “solitary” cells to that of “inter-
acting” cells (Fig. 2a), two almost overlapping ranges
of velocities (0 − 80 µm/h and 0 − 100 µm/h, respec-
tively) were found. It is also known [1] that during migra-
tion cells leave various extracellular molecules and other
polipeptides attached to the substrates. To elucidate the
eﬀect of these cell trails on the velocity ﬂuctuations we ﬁl-
tered our database in such a way that we kept only those
cell positions which distance was greater than 20µm (i.e.,

1

twice the typical cell size) of the trajectory of other cells.
Again, no qualitative diﬀerence was found in the velocity
ﬂuctuations suggesting that they are inherent property of
the cells.

One of our main ﬁndings is that F (v) of all cultures
investigated could be very well ﬁtted by an exponential
distribution

F (v) = 1 − e

−αv

(1)

within measurement errors in the entire velocity range
studied (Fig. 2b). This result indicates that the ex-
ponential velocity distribution is likely to be a general
characteristic feature of in vitro cell motility for a broad
class of surface attached cells.

The above velocity distributions were found for rela-
tively large (≈ 100 cells) populations. On the level of
individual cells the exponential behaviour (1) can be in-
terpreted in two ways: (i) The culture is inhomogeneous,
i.e., slower and faster cells can be distinguished on the
bases of well preserved phenotypic properties.
In this
case the exponential F (v) distribution can reﬂect the ra-
tio of the slow and fast cells in the culture, while the
velocity ﬂuctuations of the individual cells can show an
arbitrary distribution. (ii) If the culture is homogeneous,
then almost all cells exhibit the same distribution of ve-
locity ﬂuctuations, i.e., Fi(v) ≈ F (v) holds for each cell i,
where Fi(v) denotes the distribution function of the cell
i. In this scenario the average velocity hvi(t)i of each cell
would be the same if we could calculate the time averages
over an inﬁnitely long time. Since the time averages are
calculated over a ﬁnite time τ only, for the distribution
of the average velocities we can expect a Gamma distri-
bution with a parameter s = τ /t0, where the correlation
time of the process is denoted by t0 [23].

To decide between the above alternatives Fi(v) and
the average velocity hvi(t)i over a period of τ = 16h were
calculated for each cell i. Fig. 3a and 3b show that the
experimental data clearly support the homogeneous al-
ternative. As an example, the data shown in Fig. 3b
can be well ﬁtted by a normalized Gamma distribution
0 dzsszs−1e−sz/(s − 1)! with a parameter
FΓ(u, s) =
value of s = 9. The ﬁtted value of s is consistent with
the ﬁnding that the correlation time scale of the velocity
ﬂuctuations is in the order of hours.

The fact that the distribution of cellular velocities fol-
lows a simple exponential function is an unexpected ﬁnd-
ing. Several subprocesses of cell locomotion (receptor
binding, membrane exocitosis, lamelopodium/ﬁlopodium
formation, etc.) display either Poisson distribution [18]
or periodic behavior [22] if studied on time scales short
enough to exclude non-stationarities of the cell state.
However, the ﬂuctuations of cell velocities recorded in our
experiments were observed on signiﬁcantly longer time
scales than those listed above. Since in a few hours many
lamellopodia are formed and many vesicles are fused to
the membrane, etc., the relative frequency ﬂuctuation
of such stationary processes must be small and close to

Gaussian. In agreement with this expectation, previous
works on cell locomotion – although not calculating F (v)
explicitly – have set up phenomenological models pre-
dicting Gaussian velocity distribution [15,16,18]. Also,
a close to Gaussian distribution was found in [6] where
motion within a cell aggregate was studied. In that case,
however, there was a strong interaction between the cells
and the displacement of a single cell was also a result of
the activity of the neighboring cells.

Within the time scale of the velocity ﬂuctuations both
the cellular environment and the pattern of gene expres-
sion in the cells can be considered as stationary. This
time, on the other hand, is long enough to permit changes
in cell motility as a consequence of changes in the concen-
tration of several intracellular regulatory factors. In the
following we demonstrate with a very simple cell model
that the exponential distribution of cell velocity ﬂuc-
tuations can indeed reﬂect such stochastic intracellular
changes.

Since the cell locomotion processes are cyclic and dis-
sipative, the observed velocity is proportional to the
amount J0 of free energy dissipated (number of ATP
molecules hydrolized) in the appropriate chemical reac-
tions contributing to cell motility:

v(t) = µJ0(t),

(2)

where µ denotes the conversion factor between velocity
and energy dissipation. It is natural to assume that µ is
constant, i.e., the subprocesses are synchronized in such a
manner that a close to optimal distribution of the energy
inﬂow is maintained.

The individual reaction rates are determined on one
hand by the ATP concentration c and on the other hand
by the concentrations of various regulatory factors. Some
of these factors maintain the motility eﬃciency µ, while
other factors are products of diﬀerent cellular processes,
with the potential of altering the cell locomotion activ-
ity. These latter factors can change independently from
each other: while some of the changes increase, some oth-
ers decrease the cell motility. Thus, we assume that the
temporal changes of J0 can be represented as

dJ0
dt

= g0

+ ξ0,

dc
dt

(3)

where g0(t) > 0 and ξ0(t) is a stochastic variable with
zero mean and Gaussian distribution.

Finally, we assume that the cellular ATP production
rate P is limited by the ATP production capacity of the
cell, so the various cellular processes (among them cell
locomotion, protein synthesis, DNA duplication, etc.)
compete for the ATP available. Since the changes of c
can be calculated as a diﬀerence in the production and
the consumption rates, the equations

dJℓ

are obtained, where Jℓ denotes the rate of free energy
dissipation in a given cellular process ℓ, while gℓ and ξℓ
are analog quantities to g0 and ξ0, respectively.

It can be seen that Eqs. (4) describe a diﬀusion pro-
N
k=0 Jk = P hyperplane. Ac-
cess in the vicinity of the
P
cordingly, the probability distribution of the “cell state”
~J = (J0, J1, ..., JN ) on this hyperplane is uniform. Inte-
grating the distribution of ~J and taking into account Eq.
(2) we obtain the experimentally observed exponential
behaviour

where p = P/(N + 1) is the average free energy consump-
tion rate of a given cellular process.

(5)

There is a formal similarity between the distribution
given by Eq. (5) and the Boltzmann energy distribution
within systems in thermal equilibrium. In the latter case,
the uniform microcanonical distribution can be derived
using either quantum mechanics or Liouville’s theorem
for Hamiltonian systems while here it is an interesting
feature of the interacting regulatory processes.

Although Eq. (4) is certainly oversimpliﬁed and the
free energy dissipation rates Jℓ are not identiﬁed with
actual biochemical reactions, the exponential behavior
of Eq. (5) is expected to hold for a wide class of models
(e.g., non-constant P , considering explicitly the interac-
tions of regulatory networks, etc.). Our simple calcula-
tion also predicts that exponentially distributed ﬂuctua-
tions can be expected in numerous other cellular activi-
ties as well.

(a) Cumulative velocity distribution functions F (v) calculated from the trajectories of Fig. 1. for three subsets of
cells: “interacting”, “solitary” and cells which do not cross the trails left on the substrate (see text for details). The similarity
of the curves indicates that the ﬂuctuations are an inherent property of the cells. The horizontal bars correspond to the error
of velocity determination due mainly to the method of cell positioning. The vertical bars mark the systematic error ( ≈ 5% )
of F (v), which estimation was based on the diﬀerence between the distribution functions calculated for the ﬁrst and the second
10 hours of the record. The solid line is a ﬁtted exponential distribution function. The inset shows the same distribution
functions on a linear-logarithmic plot. (b) The velocities u = v/hvi(t)i normalized by the average velocity of the population
show an exponential distribution in all the 13 cultures investigated, demonstrated by the linear region covering four decades in
the linear-logarithmic plot. The ﬁgure shows a typical result for each cell line.

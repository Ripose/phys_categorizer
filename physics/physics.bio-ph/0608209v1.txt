Gaussian Models for the Statistical Thermodynamics of Liquid Water

J. K. Shah,∗ D. Asthagiri,† L. R. Pratt,‡ and M. E. Paulaitis∗
(Dated: February 2, 2008)

A gaussian distribution of binding energies, but conditioned to exploit generally available infor-
mation on packing in liquids, provides a statistical-thermodynamic theory of liquid water that is
structurally non-committal, molecularly realistic, and surprisingly accurate. Neglect of ﬂuctuation
contributions to this gaussian model yields a mean-ﬁeld theory that produces useless results. A
reﬁnement that accounts for sharper-than-gaussian behavior at high binding energies recognizes
contributions from a discrete number of water molecules and permits a natural matching of numer-
ically exact results. These gaussian models, which can be understood as vigorous simpliﬁcations
of quasi-chemical theories, are applicable to aqueous environments where the utility of structural
models based on geometrical considerations of water hydrogen bonding have not been established.

A widely accepted molecular-scale understanding of
liquid water under physiological conditions has evolved
over recent decades based upon the concept of promis-
cuous hydrogen-bonding that results in a thoroughly
networked ﬂuid [1]. This view rests upon extensive
molecular-scale simulation validated with traditional
experimentation, and communicated with molecular-
graphics tools. But water is a peculiar liquid. For ex-
ample, the van der Waals theory [2], which provides the
ﬁrmest basis for theories of simple liquids, is unsatis-
factory for liquid water. Fig. 1 shows one experimental
demonstration of that point. The foremost task in ap-
plying molecular statistical mechanical theory to liquid
water is to address the equation-of-state distinctions ex-
empliﬁed in Fig. 1 on the basis of realistic intermolecular
interactions. One theoretical approach is to accept the
voluminous data that can be generated in a typical, real-
istic molecular simulation, but to craft a concise, quanti-
tative statistical description of the basic thermodynamic
characteristics [3, 4]. As exempliﬁed below, those statis-
tical theories can be concise indeed, and general in scope.
The focus here is analyzing the probability density dis-
tribution, p(ε), of binding energies, ε, exhibited by a wa-
ter molecule in liquid water. Thermodynamic properties
are typically sensitive to the tails of this distribution, As
a topical example, note that the population of weakly
bound water molecules in liquid water can be decisive in
ﬁlling transitions of carbon nanotubes [5]. Thus, it can
be helpful to have a clear idea how those weakly bound
populations can be analyzed, and a focus of this work is
the analysis of p(ε).

Our motivation for the present analysis is the observa-
tion of severely non-gaussian p(ε) in cases where repul-
sive interactions are prominent contributors [7]. In such
cases, conditioning to separate out eﬀects of repulsive in-
teractions was found to yield conditional distributions,

p (ε|r ≥ λ), that were accurately gaussian. The idea is to
account separately for close molecular encounters; then
the direct statistical problem of evaluating the distribu-
tion of binding energies need only consider the fraction of
the sample for which the distance to the nearest solvent
molecule center, r, is greater than the conditioning ra-
dius λ. That fraction is p (r ≥ λ), the marginal probabil-
ity. In previous quasi-chemical treatments, the marginal
probability p (r ≥ λ) was denoted by x0 [7, 8, 9, 10].

To follow that path, we seek µex, the chemical poten-
tial of water in excess of the ideal contribution at the
same density and temperature. On the basis of simula-
tion data, we consider evaluating µex
HS, the excess chemi-
cal potential of a hard sphere solute, relative to µex. The
potential distribution theorem (PDT) [7, 10, 11] then

ergy of a water molecule in liquid water at 298 K. λ =
0.0, . . . 0.300 nm, from top to bottom with successive results
shifted incrementally shifted downward by 2 for clarity. The
solid lines are the gaussian model for each data set.

Eq. (1) gives µex. We regard this conditioning as a regu-
larization of the statistical problem embodied in Eq. (1)
when λ → 0, which is practically impossible on the ba-
sis of a direct, single calculation. After regularization,
the statistical problem becomes merely diﬃcult. A gaus-
sian distribution model for p (ε|r ≥ λ) should be accurate
when λ → ∞, since then many solution elements will
make small, weakly-correlated contributions to ε. The
marginal probability p (r ≥ λ) becomes increasingly dif-
ﬁcult to evaluate as λ becomes large, however. For λ
on the order of molecular length scales typical of dense
liquids, a simple gaussian model would accept some ap-
proximation error as the price for manageable statistical

This simple model motivates the following analyses.

(cid:11)

To test these ideas, simulation data for liquid water
was generated at 298, 350, and 400 K and 1 bar using
methods described in [9]. The hard-sphere excess chem-
ical potential was obtained from [4]. The distributions
observed for T = 298 K are shown in Fig 2. Table I col-
lects the individual terms for the gaussian model, Eq. (2),
at each temperature. The observed dependence on λ of
the free energy at each temperature is shown in Fig 3.

Fig. 2 shows that the unconditioned distribution p (ε)
displays positive skew, but the conditioning diminishes
that skew perceptibly, as expected. p (ε|r ≥ λ) is least
skewed for the largest λ, though the sample used is
smaller by the fraction p (r ≥ λ), and thus less of the tail
region is available for examination as λ becomes larger.

2

The conditioning aﬀects both the high-ε and low-ε
tails of these distributions. The mean binding energy
hε|r > λi increases with increasing λ [Table I], so we
conclude that the conditioning eliminates atypical low-
ε, well-bound conﬁgurations more than high-ε conﬁgu-
rations that reﬂect less favorable interactions. Never-
theless, because of the exponential weighting of the in-
tegrand of Eq. (1) and because the variances are large,
the high-ε side of the distributions is overwhelmingly the
more signiﬁcant in this free energy prediction.

Conversely, the ﬂuctuation contribution exhibits a
broad maximum for λ < 0.29 nm, after which this con-
tribution decreases steadily with increasing λ [Table I].
Evidently water molecules closest to the distinguished
molecule, i.e., those closer than the principal maximum
of oxygen-oxygen radial distribution function, don’t con-
tribute importantly to the ﬂuctuations. This is consistent
with a quasi-chemical picture in which a water molecule
and its nearest neighbors have a deﬁnite structural in-
tegrity.

The magnitude of the individual contributions to µex
are of the same order as the net free energy; the mean
binding energies are larger than that, as are the vari-
ance contributions in some cases. The variance contribu-
tions are about half as large as the mean binding ener-
gies, with opposite sign. It is remarkable and signiﬁcant,
therefore, that the net free energies at 298 K are within
roughly 12% of the numerically exact value computed
by the histogram-overlap method. The discrepancies at
the higher temperatures are larger, and we will return
to that point. A mean-ﬁeld-like approximation that ne-

glects ﬂuctuations produces useless results.

We note that p(r ≥ λ) ≈ 1 for the smallest values
of λ in Table I. This leads to the awkward point that
if kT ln p(r ≥ λ) is zero, then the hard-sphere contribu-
tion µex
HS is ill-deﬁned. As a general matter, the sum
µex
HS+kT ln p(r ≥ λ) cannot be identiﬁed as a hard-sphere
contribution. Since these terms have opposite signs, the
net value can be zero or negative, and those possibilities
are realized [Table I]. To deﬁne the hard-sphere contri-
bution more generally, we require µex
HS to be continuous
as λ decreases, such that p(r ≥ λ) → 1. All other terms
of Eq.
(2) will be independent of λ for values smaller
than that, and we will require that of µex

HS also.

From Fig. 3, we see that λ > 0.30 nm clearly identiﬁes
a larger-size regime where the variation of the free en-
ergy with λ is not statistically signiﬁcant. Although we
anticipate a decay toward the numerically exact value
for λ → ∞, the statistical errors become unmanageable
for values of λ much larger than 0.30 nm. When λ =

0.30 nm a signiﬁcant skew in p(ε|r ≥ λ) is not observed,
as already noted with Fig. 2. The predicted free en-
ergy µex is then distinctly above the numerically exact
value, suggesting that the gaussian model predicts too
much weight in the high-ε tail. We hypothesize that this
sharper-than-gaussian tail behavior is due to the fact that
a ﬁnite number of molecules make discrete contributions
to the net ε in this tail region. A model distribution
exhibiting this distinction is

in Eq. (2) for large n.

Since we exploit a single further datum, a single pa-
rameter exhausts that information. When λ = 0.30 nm,
the values of n that ﬁt the numerically exact results are
21, 11, and 6 at T = 298, 350, and 400 K, respectively.
These values are reasonable as indications of the discrete
number of proximal water molecules that dominate sol-
vent interactions with the distinguished molecule.

It is essential, however, to recognize that the sharper-
than-gaussian hypothesis means sharper than the sin-
gle gaussian of Eq. (2). A natural path for improve-
ment of these results would be a multi-gaussian model,
as was developed for careful evaluations of the electro-
static contribution to the free energy of liquid water
[12, 13]. But some further points, which touch upon
similarities of the multi-gaussian and quasi-chemical ap-
proaches, must be kept in mind. First, we are concerned
here with contributions from a deﬁned outer-shell region,
the direct inner-shell contributions have been relegated
to the kT ln p (r ≥ λ) term of Eq. (2). Second, the multi-
gaussian approach requires choosing a variable to strat-
ify the distribution; in the quasi-chemical approach that
variable is the number of occupants of the deﬁned shell
[14], presumably an inner outer-shell region here. Since

4

this reﬁnement has exhausted the data here, we don’t
pursue those more reﬁned approaches. But we also recog-
nize that the initial model, Eq. (2), is a compact, simple
implementation of quasi-chemical ideas.

(cid:10)

δε2|r ≥ λ

The values of n are found to correlate positively with
the variance
, such that ∆ε [Eq. (5)] is only
weakly dependent on λ. At T = 298 K, ∆ε ≈ 2 kcal/mol,
independent of λ. At the higher temperatures, ∆ε is
1-2 kcal/mol larger, and has a noticeable,
linear de-
pendence on λ. These empirical energy parameters are
of reasonable magnitude by comparison with hydrogen-
bond energies, and they do not correspond to weak in-
teractions on a thermal scale.

(cid:11)

Though these theoretical developments were unantic-
ipated, it is possible to make some connection to classi-
cal theories. Assume that the N -molecule ﬂuid can be
satisfactorily described by a pair-decomposable potential
energy function. Then a gaussian model for a joint dis-
tribution of binding energies ε1 and ε2, of molecules 1
and 2, respectively, predicts

β2 hδε1δε2|1, 2i = ln y (1, 2) ,

(7)

where y (1, 2) is the two-molecule indirect distribution
function [15], and the average is conditional upon loca-
tion of molecules at (1,2). A point of general interest is
that Eq. (7) is a signature of the random-phase family of
approximations, e.g. the Debye-H¨uckel theory. It is also
interesting that Eq. (7) does not express a conventional
mean-ﬁeld contribution. However, if the molecules con-
sidered are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent, such a relation then
is expected to resemble mean-ﬁeld contributions of the
classical type.

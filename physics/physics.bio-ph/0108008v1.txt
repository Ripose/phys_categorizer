Folding DNA into nucleosome and chromatin:
dynamics.

Thomas C. Bishop∗, Oleksandr O. Zhmudsky†

Keywords: chromatin, nucleosome, DNA, elastic rod, dynamics

Abstract

A theoretical framework for evaluating the approximate energy
and dynamic properties associated with the folding of DNA into nu-
cleosomes and chromatin is presented. For this purpose experimen-
tally determined elastic constants of linear DNA and a simple fold
geometry are assumed to derive constants for the higher order fold-
ing. The model predicts the correct order of magnitude for the ex-
perimentally determined Young’s and shear modulus of condensed
chromatin. Thus we have demonstrated that the elastic properties
of DNA are the primary determinant of the elastic properties of each
folded state. The derived elastic constants are then used to predict
the speed of propagation of small amplitude waves. It is shown that
extension/compression, twist, bend or shear waves can be excite in
each folded state.

Introduction

The folding of DNA into higher order structures is readily observed, but
the path of DNA through these folded structures has not been determined

conclusively [1]. Only the structure of individual nucleosome particles that
have been crystallized is available at atomic resolution [2]. The x-ray struc-
tures of the nucleosome reveal that DNA is wrapped around a histone core in
a somewhat irregular, left-handed helical path, but these structures do not
provide information on how multiple nucleosomes are arranged on a length
of double stranded DNA in chromatin. For this purpose a variety of exper-
imental techniques (see [1]) as well as computational modeling [3, 4, 5, 6]
have been used. In our model the hierarchy of folding: DNA, nucleosomes,
condensed chromatin, corresponds to the hierarchy of equilibrium conforma-
tions that exist for an elastic rod [7, 8, 9]. In elastic rod theory these folded
states are unstable, but biologically we know that the ﬁrst folding (nucleo-
somes) is stabilized by the histone octamer and the second folding (condensed
chromatin) is stabilized by linker histone [10].

Both an extended and condensed form of chromatin exists. The extended
conformation of chromatin is an irregular, 3-dimensional zig-zag pattern of
what appears to be intact nucleosomes unevenly spaced along DNA. The
degree of compaction of this zig-zag structure is known to be aﬀected by the
ionic environment [11]. The length of linker DNA between nucleosomes and
the entry/exit angle of the linker from each nucleosome are important but
nonetheless secondary determinants. The primary determinant of the struc-
ture of extended chromatin is the histone octamer, since under appropriate
conditions the zig-zag can be condensed into a more or less continuous, ir-
regular 11 nm ﬁber with essentially zero length linker. To obtain the next
level of folding, what we refer to as condensed chromatin with a diameter of
approximately 30 nm, requires the presence of linker histones [10]. Thus the
primary determinant of the folding of extended chromatin into condensed
chromatin is linker histone. The path of DNA in condensed chromatin is
determined by the arrangement of nucleosomes within the ﬁber and in turn,
it is expected that the arrangement of nucleosomes is determined by whether
or not the linker DNA between nucleosomes bends or remains straight.

A recent review [1] favors straight linkers and an arrangement of nucleo-
somes that resembles the 2-start model over the solenoid [12] or coiled-linker
models, (the latter two assume a bent linker), but the evidence is still in-
conclusive. Virtually all models assume the nucleosome maintains the x-ray
structure. This does not seem justiﬁed when it is known that the two (H2A-
H2B) dimers that form part of the octamer core can readily dissociate from
the nucleosome in solution and can be reversibly dissociated by changing ion

2

concentrations [13]. Furthermore the aﬀects of linker histone on the struc-
ture of the nucleosome, in particular the histone core, are not known. A
”pear-shaped” structure is apparently induced in the nucleosome upon the
binding of linker histones, as observed with electron microscopy [14, 15] and
scanning force microscopy [14]. Single ﬁber pulling experiments demonstrate
that there are discrete ”jumps” as histones dissociate from extended chro-
matin ﬁbers suggesting a simple on/oﬀ association of the histone octamer,
but the data also indicate a linear force-extension relationship for the gross
properties of the extended chromatin ﬁber, Figure 3b in [16].

Our view is that nucleosomes in particular is the arrangement of the core
histones will likely be altered by both the addition of linker histones and the
constraints imposed by folding or external forces. The latter occur during
experimental manipulations, as well as, biological processes. The observed
irregularities in extended and condensed chromatin result from a ﬂuid-like
motion of histones within nucleosomes and of nucleosomes along chromatin
in a fairly smooth energy landscape with multiple local minima. The local
minima are due in part to the sequence dependent nature of DNA, the par-
ticular state of modiﬁcation of the DNA and the histones, and diﬀerences
in the local environment. At the molecular level, the local environment has
an inhomogeneous distribution of ions and/or DNA binding proteins. The
barrier between these minima is relatively low thus well-deﬁned regular struc-
tures do not exist. We assume that to a ﬁrst approximation, i.e. we smooth
out the energy landscape even further, the structures of extended and con-
densed chromatin are governed by the elastic properties of DNA and can
be predicted based on the theory of elastic rods [7, 8, 9, 17, 18]. As noted
by Bishop and Hearst [17], the ”pear-shaped” or elliptic structures that are
observed are a tell-tale sign that DNA is behaving as an elastic rod even
when it is folded into nucleosomes and the energy landscape associated with
a potential function describing chromatin folding is suﬃciently ﬂat to allow
for the irregularities noted above. Furthermore the eﬀect of combining a his-
tone core that tends towards cylindrical symmetry with a wrapping of DNA
that tends towards elliptic cross-sections, as predicted by elastic rod theory,
produces an interaction that explains the deviation in the path of DNA as it
passes over the dyad axis of symmetry of the nucleosome.

In order to extend our potential function representation of the folding of
DNA into nucleosomes and chromatin, we seek ﬁrst to determine to what
degree DNA alone contributes to the observed properties of these structures.

For this purpose we analyze the elastic properties of an idealized nucleosome
that results from folding DNA into a regular left handed helix. If this helix
is extended beyond the 1.75 turns that correspond to a single nucleosome,
it will form a linear array of nucleosomes aligned end to end, as has been
suggested for the structure of telomeric DNA [19]. We propose that such a
model approximates the properties of extended chromatin in the limit of a
zero length linker even if it does not represent the actual structure [20]. In a
like manner condensed chromatin is modelled as a regular right handed helix
constructed from a linear array of nucleosomes, similar to the solenoid or
coiled linker models and a close approximation to the helix-on-a-linear helix
predicted by elastic rod theory. The model predicts that the elastic properties
of DNA are the primary determinant of the elastic properties of each folded
state. Our results can also be used to relate experimentally determined elastic
properties to the velocity of propagation of mechanical disturbances in DNA
and chromatin, which has direct relevance for molecular processes.

In the next section we present the equations of motion of an elastic rod
and outline the derivation of our linear analysis [21]. We then demonstrate
how to use the known elastic constants of DNA to evaluate the velocity of
propagation of various mechanical disturbances through DNA. In subsequent
sections we use the elastic constants for DNA to obtain eﬀective elastic con-
stants for nucleosomes, extended and condensed chromatin. For each ﬁber
we calculate the speed of propagation of mechanical disturbances.

Our paper is based on a continuous medium model of DNA. Such an ap-
proach is well known and widely used to describe solids, liquids and gases
(see, for example [22, 23]). Thus, when we speak of inﬁnitely small elements
of volume, we shall always mean those which are ”physically” inﬁnitely small,
i.e. very small compared with wavelength or radius of curvature under con-
sideration, but large compared with the distance between the atoms in DNA.

1 Dynamics of an Elastic Rod.

We utilize a uniform isotropic elastic rod model for which analytic solutions
for the equilibrium conﬁgurations have been determined [7] and parameter-
ized to represent the observed folding of DNA [18]. Such an elastic rod model
is a suitable description for small deformations of any solid body that is long,
slender and possesses uniform material properties. Here, small refers to the

4

length scale of the deformation in comparison to the length scale of the rod,
but still large compared to the distance between atoms. Thus the results
presented in this section apply to macroscopic objects such as cables and
beams, as well as hair and cilia, actin ﬁlaments and DNA. Strictly speaking
all experiments cited above silently suppose that DNA is a continuous media
with no structure. One only needs to utilize the appropriate elastic constants
for each entity to apply the results. The equations of motion [24] for such an
elastic rod can be solved numerically and visualized in 3-dimensional space
[25].

A natural coordinate system for expressing the equations of motion of an
elastic rod is a so-called internal coordinate system that relates the transla-
tion, denoted by the three-vector ~Ω, and the rotation, denoted by the three-
vector, of one cross-section with respect the adjacent one. These six coor-
dinates have a one to one correspondence to the six helical parameters that
describe DNA. In biologic terminology the three components of ~Γ correspond
to the basepair parameters (shift, slide, rise) and the three components of
~Ω correspond to (roll, tilt, twist). Formally, the components of ~Γ and ~Ω are
orthogonal and are deﬁned only in the limit of inﬁnitesimally thin ”base-
pairs”. For an actual strand of DNA, ~Γ and ~Ω will also be functions of time,
t, and location along the strand of DNA, s. Each basepair will also possess
translational and rotational velocity, denoted by ~γ and ~ω. The equations of
motion expressed in such a coordinate system are as follows:

The diagonal matrix ˆI is the linear density of the inertia tensor for a
cross-section of the rod. The matrix ˆC contains the shear (µ) and Young’s
modulus (Y ) as the diagonal elements and zeros everywhere else; ˆD contains

5

the bend stiﬀness (D1,2) and torsional rigidity (D3) as diagonal elements; and
ρ is the linear density of the rod.

The ﬁrst equation in (1-4) represents the balance of force and linear mo-
mentum and the second equation represents the balance of torque and angu-
lar as written in the reference frame of the rod. The use of Hooke’s Law to
describe bending/twisting deformations with respect to some arbitrary intrin-
sic bend/twist state denoted by ~Ω0 is apparent. A similar statement applies
to shear/stretch deformations with respect to some intrinsic shear/extension
~Γ0. For ideal B-from DNA ~Ω0 = (0, 0, 360/bp) and ~Γ0 = (0, 0, 3.4 ˚A/bp).
The third and fourth equations arise from geometrical considerations. More
thorough descriptions can be found in [24, 25].

In subsequent sections we consider DNA as an elastic rod, extended chro-
matin as an elastic rod and condensed chromatin as an elastic rod. In each
case we only have to determine appropriate values for each of the matrices
in the above equations. Once these values have been determined the velocity
of propagation of a mechanical disturbance through each structure can be
evaluated as described below.

A linear analysis (small amplitude disturbances) of equations (1-4) indi-
cates that four diﬀerent types of waves can propagate through the elastic rod
[21]. These are an extension/compression, bend, twist, or shear waves in the
rod. In the limit of very short wavelength (wavelength is much smaller than
scale parameters of the problem, e.g. much less than radius of curvature of
the rod) these four types propagate independently of one another and inde-
pendently of a shape of a rod. In this case expressions for speed of waves
propagation will be obtained below.

The linear analysis assumes that the four three-vector functions ~Γ(s, t),
~Ω(s, t), ~γ(s, t) and ~ω(s, t) each have the functional form ~Gi(s, t) = ~Gi0 ·
exp(−iωt+iks) where ~Gi0 is a constant. Upon substitution into the linearized
equations of motion one obtains the following relations:

iω2ρ~Γ − ik2( ˆC · ~Γ) = 0
= 0

iω2( ˆI · ~Ω) − ik2

ˆD · ~Ω
(cid:16)

It is convenient to split the longitudinal and transverse components with help
of the deﬁnitions ~Γ⊥ ≡ (Γ1, Γ2, 0) and ~Ω⊥ ≡ (Ω1, Ω2, 0). In this way we can
easily divide the four types of wave types which can propagate along the rod.
The equations below correspond to four waves: shear, extension, bend and

6

twist respectively:

(ω2ρ − k2C)~Γ⊥ = 0
(ω2ρ − k2C3)Γ3 = 0
(ω2I − k2D)~Ω⊥ = 0
(2ω2I − k2D3)Ω3 = 0

We point out that in general case (arbitrary wavelength) bend and shear
waves are coupled but extension and twist remain independent. Moreover it
can be shown that for straight rod extension and twist waves have ”special”
properties. They are independent of each other and of bend and shear waves
even for not small wave amplitudes. Our assumption of a circular cross
section (D1 = D2, C1 = C2 and Ixx = Iyy) results in a equivalents speed of
propagation for both components of bend and shear.
Explicit expressions for the wave velocities are:

• Shear waves (~Γ⊥):

• Extension waves (Γ3):

• Bend waves (~Ω⊥):

• Twist waves (Ω3):

We point out that expressions (11-14) are rightly for a rod of arbitrary
shape because in the short wave limit all terms that deﬁne the rod shape in
equations (1-4) were vanished.

It is well known that the measurement of wave velocities is a usual method
for determining elastic properties of solids. Just so the DNA elastic properties
were studied in [29].

2 Dynamics of linear DNA.

Having obtained expressions (11-14) we evaluate the propagation velocities
of each type of mechanical disturbance for linear B-form DNA using the
elastic properties listed in Table 1. The results are listed in Table 3. For our
calculations we have used a linear density of DNA of ρdna = 660 Da/basepair·
basepair/0.34˚A, and assumed a DNA radius of 1.0 nm with a circular cross-
section for determining the moment of inertia tensor.

3 Eﬀective Elastic Constants for Nucleosomes

and Chromatin.

In this section we demonstrate how to determine eﬀective elastic constants
for nucleosomes and condensed chromatin. For this purpose we analyze the
nucleosome as a regular helical spring made of DNA and condensed chromatin
as a regular helical spring made of a linear array of nucleosomes. In case of
In the ﬁrst case,
the ”nucleosome spring” we consider two limiting cases.
we imagine that the histones stably fold the DNA into a helix, yet the DNA
is free to undergo small deformations independent of the histones. For this

8

case the histones are completely ignored, and the nucleosome is really a
spring made from DNA. In the second case we image that the DNA is rigidly
attached to the histones but that the elastic properties of the nucleosome are
still governed by DNA. In this case the nucleosome is a spring made from
DNA but it is ﬁlled with a core material made of histones. For the analysis
we need to know the elastic constants of DNA, the linear density of DNA
and the histones and the fold geometry. Since each fold is a simple helix, the
pitch and radius of the helix deﬁne the geometry. The radius of each helix is
deﬁned as the centerline path of the DNA in case of the nucleosome and the
center line path of the nucleosomes in case of condensed chromatin.

3.1 DNA elastic properties.

3.1.1 Geometry of folding.

A length of linear DNA we shall designate by an l, a length of a linear array
of nucleosomes by an L and a length of the condensed chromatin by an L.
The radius of linear DNA is a = 1.0 nm, the radius of the nucleosome is
R = 4.5 nm and the radius of condensed chromatin is R = 9.5 nm. The
nucleosome’s pitch is h = 2.5 nm and chromatin’s pitch is H = 15 nm. Note
that there are 1.75 turns of the helix for a single nucleosome, but for a linear
array of nucleosomes there will be n turns. Thus we can evaluate L = n · h
and similarly for N turns of the 30nm ﬁber L = N · H. The length of linear
DNA contained within n turns of a linear array of nucleosomes is lnuc =
(n2πR)2 + (nh)2 and the length of a linear array of nucleosomes contained
q
(N2πR)2 + (NH)2 . This
within N turns of condensed chromatin is Lcc =
yields a factor of lnuc/L ∼ 10 for the compaction of DNA into nucleosomes
and an additional factor of Lcc/L ∼ 4 for the compaction of nucleosomes into
condensed chromatin.

3.1.2 Linear mass density and moments of inertia.

In the limit that the DNA functions independently of the histones, the linear
density of the nucleosome is easy to calculate. The linear density of our
”nucleosome spring” is :

ρnuc = ρdna ·

≈ 3.66 · 10

−14[K/M]

(15)

lnuc
L

9

In the limit that the histones are rigidly attached to the DNA the linear
density of the nucleosome is the sum of the linear density expressed above
and the linear density of histones (108, 500 Da/nucleosome). In this limit
ρnuc = 1.1 · 10−13[K/M].

The linear density of condensed chromatin is accordingly ρcc = ρnucLcc/L
with a value of 4.5 · 10−13[K/M] for the limiting case of the histones rigidly
attached to the DNA. We point out that to vary the linker length the value
of lnuc should be changed accordingly.

For determining the moments of inertia we consider each spring as a hol-
low elastic rod. The walls are made of DNA in case of the ”nucleosome
spring” and of nucleosomes in case of the ”condensed chromatin spring”.
Again, the nucleosome spring has two limits. In the limit that the DNA is
rigidly attached to the histones, the core of the spring is ﬁlled with histones
and the moments of inertia are calculated according to the expressions for
rods. In the limit that the DNA is independent of the histones, the nucleo-
some spring is hollow, and the moments of inertia are calculated as for a tube.
Analysis of the elastic constants in the latter limit is formally equivalent to
our analysis of a condensed chromatin spring.

3.2 Elastic constants for Nucleosomes and Extended

Chromatin.

3.2.1 Extension/compression constant of the nucleosome.

Following the analysis of springs presented in Elmore and Heald [28], when
our ”nucleosome spring” is stretched along the axial direction the DNA in
the nucleosome undergoes a twisting deformation. The twisting deformation
of the DNA treated as a solid cylinder is related to its shear modulus, thus
the nucleosome spring constant knuc = F/∆X relates to the shear modulus
of the DNA, µdna, as follows:

knuc =

πµdnaa4
2R2
centlnuc

(16)

Here a is the radius of the DNA, Rcent is the centerline radius of the nucleo-
some spring and lnuc is the length of DNA in the nucleosome. We now treat
the nucleosome spring as a cylinder with outer and inner radii, Rout and Rin
and cross-sectional area, A = π{(Rout)2 − (Rin)2}. The Young’s modulus for

10

such a hollow cylinder is (Young’s modulus is related to the stretch modulus
Y ∗ = Y · A):

Ynuc =

knucL
A

=

µdnaa4L
out − R2

in)lnuc

2R2(R2
In the ﬁrst limiting case the DNA moves independently of the histone
core so we choose Rout = R + a and Rin = R − a. In the second limiting case
the DNA is rigidly attached to the histone core so we choose Rout = R + a
and Rin = 0. The corresponding values for the Young’s modulus are given
in Table 2. There also one can ﬁnd shear modulus, torsion rigidity and bend
shtiﬀness that will be evaluated below.

(17)

3.2.2 Shear constant.

Again, following the analysis of springs in [28], we determine the shear con-
stant for the nucleosome by supposing that a pair of equal and opposite axial
torques M is applied to the ends of our nucleosome spring that has length L.
Such a twisting distortion of the nucleosome causes the radius of the nucle-
osome to increase or decrease thus bending the DNA. So the twist constant
of our nucleosome spring is a function of the bend stiﬀness of the DNA. The
torsion constant for the nucleosome spring is:

kϕ−nuc =

=

M
ϕ

2IY
lnuc

=

πYdnaa4
2lnuc

where ϕ is twist angle of the nucleosome, I = (π/4)a4, is the moment of
the DNA cross-section, Ydna is the Young’s modulus of the DNA, and lnuc is
the length of DNA in the nucleosome. We now consider the nucleosome as
a cylinder with outer and inner radii, Rout and Rin and write an expression
for the torsion constant as follows:

Here µnuc is shear modulus of the nucleosome, and L is its length. Equating
these two expressions we obtain (µ∗ = µ · A as for the Young’s modulus):

In the ﬁrst limiting case the DNA moves independently of the histone core
so we choose Rout = R + a and Rin = R − a. In the second limiting case
the DNA is rigidly attached to the histone core so we choose Rout = R + a
and Rin = 0. The corresponding values for the shear modulus are given in
Table 2. In that table units are the same as in the Table 1.

3.2.3 Torsional rigidity constant.

Having obtained µnuc we can now evaluate the torsional rigidity constant of
a cylinder as a function of shear modulus:

Dnuc

µnucπ(R4

(21)

In the limiting case that the DNA moves independently of the histone core
Rout = R + a and Rin = R − a. In the other limit Rout = R + a and Rin = 0.
The values for the torsional rigidity are listed in Table 2.

3.2.4 Bend stiﬀness constant.

To complete the analysis, the bending stiﬀness of a hollow rod with circular
cross-section is a function of its Young’s modulus as follows:

Dnuc

In the the limiting case that the DNA moves independently of the histone
core Rout = R + a and Rin = R − a. In the other limit Rout = R + a and
Rin = 0. The values for the bending stiﬀness are listed in Table 2.

3.3 Elastic constants for Condensed Chromatin.

Since we treat condensed chromatin as a spring made from a linear array
of nucleosomes, which contain a solid core of histones, the expressions for
the elastic constants for condensed chromatin are identical in form to the
previous section. The only diﬀerences are that instead of using the pitch
and radius of the nucleosome and the elastic constants of DNA we use the
pitch and radius for condensed chromatin (i.e. L is replaced everywhere by
L, lnuc by Lcc, and a by R) and elastic constants for the nucleosome. We

12

only use the elastic constants for the nucleosome obtained in the limiting
case of DNA rigidly attached to the histone core, and we analyze condensed
chromatin with a hollow core (i.e. Rout = R + R + a and Rout = R −
R − a where R, R and a are the centerline radii of condensed chromatin
and the nucleosome and the radius of DNA, respectively). The resulting
values for the elastic constants for condensed chromatin are given in Table 2.
Alternatively experimentally determined values for extended chromatin can
be used at this step to determine elastic constants for condensed chromatin,
or experimentally determined elastic constants for condensed chromatin can
be used to determine eﬀective constants for extended chromatin.

4 Wave Propagation in Extended and Con-

densed Chromatin.

In this section we use the derived elastic constants listed in Table 2 to evalu-
ate the dynamics of extended and condensed suitable chromatin. The elastic
constants for the nucleosome are for measuring the force and torque associ-
ated with distortions of individual nucleosomes. Propagating of mechanical
disturbance through the single nucleosome will be problematic because of

13

length scale requirement. However we can consider the propagation of waves
through a linear array of nucleosomes as an approximation to extended chro-
matin.

These results are valid for any shape in which the curvature of the rod is
much greater than the wavelength of the disturbance. The velocities of prop-
agation of mechanical disturbances for extended and condensed chromatin
are listed in Table 3.

5 Conclusions.

We brieﬂy compare the predictions of our model to published experimental
results. First the speed of sound in B-form DNA as measured by Brillouin
scattering has been reported as 1.9km/s [29], which diﬀers from the value
listed in Table 3 by a factor of 3. Thus our calculations indicate that ex-
perimental results obtained from fundamentally diﬀerent approaches agree
quite well, and that relating the speed of sound in DNA to its elastic prop-
erties (i.e. equations (11-14)) is valid for DNA as it is for other macroscopic
materials.

For the evaluation of the elastic properties of extended chromatin, we
note that there is a linear relationship between the average stretching force
and the extension of λ-DNA in Figure 3b of [16]. The corresponding spring
constant is approximately 10pN/10µm. The sample contains core histones
but no linker histones thus according to our model this system is extended

14

chromatin. We note that the degree of compaction, 16um DNA/2um chro-
matin, is in close agreement with our value of 10 for the extended chromatin
model. Converting the force constant to a Young’s modulus using Equation
17 gives a value of Y ∗ = Y A = 2 · 10−12[KM/S2] which is the same as listed
in Table 2 for extended chromatin. Thus the gross properties of the stretch-
ing are determined by the elastic properties of the DNA, but the speciﬁc
details remain dependent on the histone-DNA interactions as illustrated by
the results in Figure 3c of [16].

Our model of condensed chromatin yields a Young’s modulus and bend
stiﬀness that closely predicts the persistence length and stretch modulus mea-
sured for chicken erythrocyte chromatin [30]. This sample contained linker
histone so the folding should correspond to our model of condensed chro-
matin, however the reported degree of compaction (∼ 10) corresponded to our
model of extended chromatin. The reported persistence length, P = 30 nm,
can be converted to a bending stiﬀness, D1,2 = P kbT = 1.2 · 10−28[KM 3/S2]
which diﬀers by a factor of 20 from the value listed in Table 2. The reported
stretch modulus of approximately Y ∗ = 5·10−12N for condensed chromatin is
a factor of 50 diﬀerent than listed in Table 2. These values are actually much
closer to our predicted values for extended chromatin diﬀering by factors of
2 and 3, respectively. We oﬀer two possibilities for explaining the discrep-
ancy. One is that the degree of compaction reported in [30] indicates that
the ﬁber should more closely resemble our model of extended chromatin than
condensed chromatin. The other possibility is that the elastic properties of
condensed chromatin are not determined primarily by the elastic properties
of DNA as we have assumed in this manuscript, but that intermolecular in-
teractions arising during the folding must also be considered. In this regard,
we believe that our results which are based on a purely mechanical model
provide good agreement with experiment.

Our main point has been to demonstrate how the folding of DNA leads
to a hierarchy of time and energy as well as length scales. For this purpose
we have evaluated elastic constants that correspond to ideal geometries of
nucleosomes and extended and condensed chromatin and then evaluated the
speed of propagation of mechanical disturbances through each of these struc-
tures. The hierarchy of lengths resulting from the folding of linear DNA into
nucleosomes provides a factor of 10 reduction in length and the folding of
nucleosomes into condensed chromatin provides another factor of 4 in com-
paction of linear DNA. Since the potential energy of deforming an elastic

15

body is directly proportional to the elastic constants simple ratios highlight
the hierarchy of energy associated with the folding. For example the Young’s
modulus for DNA divided by the Young’s modulus for extended chromatin
is approximately 105 while the corresponding ratios for torsional rigidity and
bend stiﬀness are approximately 10. The velocities presented in Table 3
are an indication of the hierarchy of time scales. There is approximately a
100 fold reduction in the velocity of a mechanical disturbance propagating
through DNA as compared to extended chromatin and less than a factor of
10 reduction between extended and condensed chromatin. Assuming that
similar ratios occur for yet even higher order folding, the atomic scale of
DNA can be folded into the macroscopic scale of the cell in as few as 6 or 7
folds. This is the same order of folding that exists for chromosomes during
mitosis.

We emphasis that our model is an approximate model, it does not nec-
essarily correspond to the atomic structure of any of the modeled structures
or the sequence dependent nature of DNA. Experimentally measured elastic
constants that correspond to a particular sample source and speciﬁc exper-
imental conditions should be utilized in our velocity expressions to deter-
mine the speed of propagation of mechanical disturbances through extended
and condensed chromatin. These speeds of propagation are of fundamen-
tal importance because they are literally the speed of sound in DNA. For
comparison the speed of sound in water approximately ∼ 1.5km/s (15˚A/ps)
and in steel is ∼ 5km/s (50˚A/ps). Mechanical disturbances associated with
biological processes propagate at the speed of sound whether through the
nucleus (water), DNA, or chromatin. Knowing these speeds of propagation
enables us to identity through which medium a mechanical disturbance may
be propagating.

The fact that twist disturbances propagate along DNA is readily observed
during transcription and is implicit in DNA topological studies of twist re-
laxation. Disturbances exciting a bend, shear or extension are not as readily
identiﬁable, but certainly the interaction of a DNA binding protein deep in
the major groove of DNA will aﬀect such disturbances.

[20] If we consider extended chromatin as consisting of nucleosome core par-
ticles connected via linker DNA the eﬀective model in our approach
is nucleosome springs connected via straight rods. The stretching force
constant for the straight rod will be greater than for the nucleosome
spring, thus when the ﬁber is pulled only the springs will extend. The
straight rod segments only serve to lengthen the ﬁber. A similar state-
ment holds for our model of condensed chromatin in which the stiﬀer
spring consists of segments of extended chromatin.

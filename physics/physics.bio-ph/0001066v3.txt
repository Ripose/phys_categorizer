Abstract

The systematics of indices of physico-chemical properties of codons and amino acids across
the genetic code are examined. Using a simple numerical labelling scheme for nucleic acid bases,
A = (−1, 0), C = (0, −1), G = (0, 1), U = (1, 0), data can be ﬁtted as low order polynomials
of the 6 coordinates in the 64-dimensional codon weight space. The work conﬁrms and extends
the recent studies by Siemion et al. (1995) (BioSystems 36, 63-69) of the conformational pa-
rameters. Fundamental patterns in the data such as codon periodicities, and related harmonics
and reﬂection symmetries, are here associated with the structure of the set of basis monomials
chosen for ﬁtting. Results are plotted using the Siemion one-step mutation ring scheme, and
variants thereof. The connections between the present work, and recent studies of the genetic
code structure using dynamical symmetry algebras, are pointed out.

Keywords: Physico-chemical properties, genetic code, periodicity, dynamical symmetry

Introduction and main results

Fundamental understanding of the origin and evolution of the genetic code (Osawa et al., 1991)
must be grounded in detailed knowledge of the intimate relationship between the molecular
biochemistry of protein synthesis, and the retrieval from the nucleic acids of the proteins’ stored
design information. However, as pointed out by Lacey and Mullins in 1983, although ‘the nature
of an evolutionary biochemical ediﬁce must reﬂect . . . its constituents, . . . properties which were
important to prebiotic origins may not be of relevance to contemporary systems’. Ever since
the ﬁnal elucidation of the genetic code, this conviction has led to many studies of the basic
building blocks themselves, the amino acids and the nucleic acid bases. Such studies have sought
to catalogue and understand the spectrum of physico-chemical characteristics of these molecules,
and of their mutual correlations. The present work is a contribution to this programme.

Considerations of protein structure point to the fundamental importance of amino acid hy-
drophilicity and polarity in determining folding and enzymatic capability, and early work (Woese
et al., 1966; Volkenstein, 1966; Grantham, 1974) concentrated on these aspects; Weber and
Lacey (1978) extended the work to mono- and di-nucleosides. Jungck (1978) concluded from a
compilation of more than a dozen properties that correlations between amino acids and their cor-
responding anticodon dinucleosides were strongest on the scale of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity
or of molecular volume/polarity. For a comprehensive review see Lacey and Mullins (1983).

Subsequent to this early work, using statistical sequence information, conformational indices
of amino acids in protein structure have been added to the data sets (Goodman and Moore,
1977). Recently Siemion (1994a, 1994b) has considered the behaviour of these parameters across
the genetic code, and has identiﬁed certain periodicities and pseudosymmetries present when
the data is plotted in a certain rank ordering called ‘one-step mutation rings’, being generated
by a hierarchy of cyclic alternation of triplet base letters (Siemion and Stefanowicz,1992). The
highest level in this hierarchy is the alternation of the second base letter, giving three major
cycles based on the families U , C and A, each sharing parts of the G family. The importance of
the second base in relation to amino acid hydrophilicity is in fact well known (Weber and Lacey,
1978; Lacey and Mullins, 1983; Taylor and Coates, 1989), and the existence of three independent
correlates of amino acid properties, again associated with the U , C and A families, has also been
statistically established by principal component analysis (Sj¨ostrom and W¨old, 1985).

Given the existence of identiﬁable patterns in the genetic code in this sense, it is of some
interest and potential importance to attempt to describe them more quantitatively. Steps along
these lines were taken in 1995 by Siemion et al. With a linear rank ordering of amino acids
according to ‘mutation angle’ πk/32, k = 1, . . . , 64 along the one-step mutation rings, param-
eter P α was reasonably approximated by trigonometric functions which captured the essential
ﬂuctuations in the data.

The metaphor of a quantity such as the Siemion number k, allowing the genetic code to be
arranged in a way which best reﬂects its structure, in analogy with elemental atomic number
Z and the chemical periodic table, is an extremely powerful one. The present paper takes
up this idea, but in a more ﬂexible way which does not rely on a single parameter. Instead,
a natural labelling scheme is used which is directly related to the combinatorial fact of the
triplet base codon structure of the genetic code, and the four-letter base alphabet. Indeed, any
bipartite labelling system which identiﬁes each of the four bases A, C, G, U , extends naturally to
a composite labelling for codons, and hence amino acids. We choose for bases two coordinates
as A = (−1, 0), C = (0, −1), G = (0, 1), U = (1, 0), so that codons are labelled as ordered
sextuplets, for example ACG = (−1, 0, 0, −1, 0, 1).

In quantitative terms, any numerical indices of amino acid or codon properties, of physico-

chemical or biological nature, can then be modelled as some functions of the coordinates of
this codon ‘weight space’. Because of other algebraic approaches to the structure of the genetic
code, we take polynomial functions (for simplicity, of as low order as possible). This restriction
does not at all exclude the possibility of periodicities and associated symmetry patterns in the
data. In fact, as each of the six coordinates takes discrete values 0, ±1, appropriately chosen
monomials can easily reproduce such eﬀects (with coeﬃcients to be ﬁtted which reﬂect the
relative strengths of various diﬀerent ‘Fourier’ components). Quite simply, the directness of the
linear rank ordering, as given by the Siemion number k, which suggests Fourier series analysis of
the data, is here replaced by a more involved labelling system, but with numerical data modelled
as simple polynomial functions.

The main results of our analysis are as follows. In §2 the labelling scheme for nucleic acid
bases is introduced, leading to 4N -dimensional ‘weight spaces’ for length-N RNA strands:
in
particular, 16-dimensional for N = 2, and 64-dimensional for the sextuplet codon labelling
(N =3). For N = 2 the dinucleoside hydrophilicity, dinucleotide hydrophobicity, and free energy
of formation of 2-base RNA duplices are considered. Displayed as linear plots (or bar charts)
on a ranking from 1 to 16, the data have obvious symmetry properties, and corresponding basis
monomials are identiﬁed, resulting in good ﬁts. Only four coordinates are involved for these
16- part data sets (see table 1). Moving in §3 on to codon properties as correlated to those
of amino acids, Siemion number k which establishes amino acid ranking by mutation angle is
brieﬂy reviewed. It is shown that the trigonometric approximation of Siemion et al. (Siemion
et al., 1995) to the Chou-Fasman conformational parameters P α, P β (Chou and Fasman, 1975;
Fasman, 1989) is eﬀectively a four-parameter function which allows for periodicities of 32/5,
8, 32/3 and 64 codons. Again, simple basis monomials having the required elements of the
symmetry structure of P α are identiﬁed, leading to a reasonable (four-parameter) ﬁt. Results
are displayed as Siemion mutation-angle plots. P β is treated in a similar fashion. The method
established in §§2 and 3 is then applied in §4 to other amino acid properties, including relative
hydrophilicity (Weber and Lacey, 1978) and Grantham polarity (Grantham, 1974). It is clearly
shown that appropriate polynomial functions can be ﬁtted to most of them (amino acid data is
summarised in table 2).

In §5 some concluding remarks, and outlook for further development of these ideas are given.
It is emphasised that, while the idiosyncracies of real biology make it inappropriate to regard this
type of approach as anything but approximate, nonetheless there may be some merit in a more
rigorous follow up to establish our conclusions in a statistically valid way. This is particularly
interesting in view of the appendix, §A. This gives a brief review of algebraic work based on
methods of dynamical symmetries in the analysis of the excitation spectra of complex systems
(such as atoms, nuclei and molecules), which has recently been proposed to explain the origin
and evolution of the genetic code. Speciﬁcally, it is shown how the labelling scheme adopted
in the paper arises naturally in the context of models, based either on the Lie superalgebra
A5,0 ∼ sl(6/1), or the Lie algebra B6 ∼ so(13), or related semisimple algebras. The origins
and nature of the polynomial functions adopted in the paper, and generalisations of these, are
also discussed in the algebraic context. The relationship of the present paper to the dynamical
symmetry approach is also sketched in §5 below.

2 Codon systematics

Ultimately our approach involves a symmetry between the 4 heterocyclic bases U,C,A,G com-
monly occurring in RNA. A logical starting point then, is to consider the physical properties of
small RNA molecules. Dinucleosides and dinucleotides in particular are relevant in the informa-

tional context of the genetic code and anticode, and moreover are the building blocks for larger
nucleic acids (NA’s). What follows in this section is a numerical study of some properties of
NA’s consisting of 2 bases, while in later sections NA’s with 3 bases (i.e. codons and anticodons)
are considered in the context of the genetic code as being correlated with properties of amino
acids.

As mentioned in the introduction, we give each NA base coordinates in a two-dimensional
‘weight space’, namely A = (−1, 0), C = (0, −1), G = (0, 1), U = (1, 0) with the axes labelled
d, m respectively ∗. Dinucleosides and dinucleotides are therefore associated with four coordi-
nates (d1, m1, d2, m2), e.g. AC = (−1, 0, 0, −1) with subscripts referring to the ﬁrst and second
base positions.

The physical properties of nucleic acids we choose to ﬁt to are the relative hydrophilicities
Rf of the 16 dinucleoside monophosphates as obtained by Weber and Lacey (1978), the relative
hydrophobicity Rx of dinucleotides as calculated by Jungck (Jungck, 1978) from the mononu-
cleotide data of Garel et al. (1973), and the 16 canonical (Crick-Watson) base-pair stacking
parameters of Xia et al. (1998) used to compute the free heat of formation G0
37 of formation of
duplex RNA strands at 37◦ Centigrade.

It should be noted that the dinucleoside quantity Rx was computed as the product of exper-
imentally derived Rx values for mononucleotides under the assumption that this determines the
true dinucleotide values to within 95 %. A result of this is that Rx is automatically the same
for dinucleotides 5′ − XY − 3′ and 5′ − Y X − 3′, (naturally the same holds for molecules with
the reverse orientation); thus Rx is at best an approximate symmetry.

The 16 Turner free-energy parameters are a subset of a larger number of empirically de-
termined thermodynamic “rules of thumb” (see Xia et al.,1998; Mathews et al. 1999, for the
most recent results) , developed to predict free heats of formation of larger RNA and DNA
molecules. The possibility that these rules have an underlying group-theoretical structure is a
consideration for a future work. For now it suﬃces to observe that due to geometry (see table
1) the duplex formed by 5′ − XY − 3′ with 3′ − ¯Y ¯X − 5′ is just a rotated version of the duplex
5′ − ¯X ¯Y − 3′ with 3′ − Y X − 5′. Here ¯X denotes the Crick-Watson complementary base to X.
Furthermore the duplices formed by so-called “self-complementary” dinucleosides (5′ − GC − 3′
with 5′ − CG − 3′ and 5′ − AU − 3′ with 5′ − U A − 3′) are thermodynamically suppressed due
to the extra rotational symmetry (i.e there are 2 ways such a duplex can form) and one needs
to include extra monomials to compensate for this. It is easy to see that the above rotational
symmetry corresponds to the change of coordinates

(d1, m1, d2, m2) → (−d2, −m2, −d1, −m1)

(1)

and thus we need look only at monomials which respect this symmetry, for example m1 − m2,
d1d2 and (d1m2+d2m1). The least-squares ﬁt to the most recent values of the Turner parameters
(Xia et al., 1998) is shown in ﬁgure 1 and is given by

− G0

37(d1, m1, d2, m2) = 1.133 + 0.02((m1 + d1)m2 + d2(m1 − d1)) + 1.001(m2

1 + m2
2)

− 0.1d1d2 + 0.035(d1 − d2) + 0.1(m1 − m2)
+ 0.165m1m2(m2 − m1 + 1) + 0.0225d1d2(d2 − d1 − 1).

(2)

Here we have considered all linear and quadratic terms respecting the symmetry Eq.(1) and
added cubic symmetry-breaking terms which are speciﬁc to the self-complementary duplices.

∗The choice (±1, ±1) and (±1, ∓1) for the four bases simply represents a 45◦ rotation of the adopted scheme,
which turns out to be more convenient for our purposes. The nonzero labels at each of the four base positions
are given by the mnemonic ‘d iamond ’.

The number of monomials may be reduced with the identities:

i = 1 − m2
d2
i

midi = 0,

(3)

(4)

Encouraged by this success we attempt a similar ﬁt to Rf and Rx. While there is no obvious
underlying symmetry a priori as in the previous discussion, one might expect these properties
to be anti-correlated and so the same set of monomials is considered for each. Qualitatively
faithful ﬁts may be obtained using a small number of monomials, as shown in ﬁgure 2. The
functions

Rf (d1, m1, d2, m2) = 0.191 − 0.087(d2
Rx(d1, m1, d2, m2) = 0.3278 + 0.093(d2

1 + d2
1 + d2

2) + 0.09d1 + 0.107d2 − 0.053m1 − 0.077m2, (5)
2) − 0.1814(d1 + d2) + 0.0539(m1 + m2)
(6)

are seen to compare favourably to the experimental values and that moreover Rf and Rx are
roughly anti-correlated. Thus ﬁtting to these using the same set of monomials seems to be a
valid procedure in this initial approximation.

3 Amino acid conformational parameters

As a case study for amino acid properties (as opposed to their correlated codon properties
in §2 above) we consider the structural conformational parameters P α and P β, which have
introduced a quantity k ,
been discussed by Siemion (1994a, 1994b). In 1995 Siemion et al.
k = 1, . . . , 64, which deﬁned the so-called ‘mutation angle’ πk/32 for a particular assignment
of codons (and hence of amino acids) in rank ordering. This is a ramiﬁcation of the four-ring
ordering used above for plots (expanded from 16 to 64 points), and arises from a certain hierarchy
of one-step base mutations. It assigns the following k values to the N N ′Y and N N ′R codons†

wherein (as in the ‘four ring’ scheme) the third base alternates as . . . − G, A − U, C − C, U −

ordering corresponds to a particular trajectory around the diamond-shaped representation of
the genetic code (ﬁgure 3), which is pictured in ﬁgure 4 (Siemion, 1994a) where nodes have been
labelled by amino acids.

Inspecting the trends of assigned P α values for the amino acids ordered in this way, a
suggestive 8-codon periodicity, and a plausible additional C2 rotation axis about a spot in the
centre of the diagram, have be identiﬁed (Siemion, 1994a,1994b). Figure 5 gives various ﬁts to
this data, as follows. Firstly, consideration of the modulation of the peaks and troughs of the

a histogram along with P α
F above; as can be seen, both ﬁts show similar trends, and
both have diﬃculty in reproducing the data around the ﬁrst position codons of the C family in
the centre of the diagram (see caption to ﬁgure 5).

S , and P α

2 m3 (with values − 3

Basing the systematics of the genetic code on numerical base labels, as advocated in the
present work, a similar analysis to the above trigonometric functions is straighforward, but now
in terms of polynomials over the six codon (i.e. trinucleotide) coordinates (d1, m1, d2, m2, d3, m3).
There is no diﬃculty in establishing basic 8-codon periodic functions; combinations such as
2 d3 − 1
3
2 on A, G, C, U ), or more simply the perfect Y /R discrimi-
nator d3 − m3 (with values −1, +1 on R, Y respectively) can be assumed. Similarly, terms such
as d1 ± m1 have period 16, and d2 ± m2 have period 64. The required modulation of the 8-codon
periods can also be regained by including in the basis functions for ﬁtting a term such as d2
2,
and ﬁnally an enhancement of the C ring family boxes GCN , CCN is provided by the cubic
term m1m2(m2 − 1). The resulting least-squares ﬁtted function is

noted that, despite much greater ﬁdelity in the C ring, P α

range of acceptable ﬁts, a second monomial is displayed in ﬁgure 7 whose d2

S
of ﬁgure 5 in displaying a much more pronounced eight-codon periodicity than allowed by the
least-squares algorithm.

The nature of the eight-codon periodicity is related to the modulation of the conformational
status of the amino acids through the R or Y nature of their third codon base (Siemion and
Siemion, 1994). A sharper discriminator of this is the diﬀerence P α − P β, which suggests that
a more appropriate basis for identifying numerical trends is with P α − P β (the helix-forming
potential) and P α + P β (generic-structure-forming potential). Although we have not analysed
the data in this way, this is indirectly borne out by separate ﬁtting (along the same lines as
above) of P β, for which no signiﬁcant component of (d3 − m3) is found. A typical ﬁve-parameter
ﬁt, independent of third base coordinate, is given by

P β
6 (d1, m1, d2, m2, d3, m3) =
1.02 + .26d2 + .09d2

1 − .19d2(d1 − m1) − .1d1m2(m2 − 1) − .16m2

1m2(m2 − 1).

(11)

Figure 8 shows that this function does indeed average over the third base Y /R ﬂuctuations
evident in the A family data. A major component appears to be the dependence on (d1 − m1),
that is, on the Y /R nature of the ﬁrst codon base, responsible for the major peaks and troughs
visible on the A and U rings (and reﬂected in the d2(d1 − m1) term). The cubic and quartic
terms follow the modulation of the data on the C ring.

The suggested pseudosymmetries of the conformational parameters are important for trigono-
metric functions of the mutation angle, and for polynomial ﬁts serve to identify leading monomial
terms with simple properties. The d2(d1 − m1) term in the ﬁt of P β
6 above has been noted al-
ready in this connection. In the case of P α, it should be noted that an oﬀset of 2 codons in
the position of a possible C2 rotation axis (from k = 34, between ACY and ACR to k = 32,
after GCY ) changes the axis from a pseudosymmetry axis (minima coincide with maxima after
rotation) to a true symmetry axis (as the alignment of minima and maxima is shifted by four
codons), necessitating ﬁtting by a period-eight component which is even about k = 32. At the
same time the large amplitude changes in the C ring appear to require an odd function, and are
insensitive to whether the C2 axis is chosen at k = 32 or k = 34. The terms in P α
6 above have
just these properties.

4 Other amino acid properties

In this section we move from the biologically-measured conformational parameters to biochemical
indices of amino acid properties. Two of the most signiﬁcant of these are the Grantham polarity
(Grantham, 1974) and the relative hydrophilicity as obtained by Weber and Lacey (1978).
Variations in chemical reactivity have been considered (Siemion and Stefanowicz, 1992), but are
not modelled here.

The composite Grantham index incorporates weightings for molecular volume and molecular
weight, amongst other ingredients (Grantham, 1974). From ﬁgure 10 it is evident that a major
pattern is a broad 16-codon periodicity (indicative of a term linear in d2). Additional smaller
ﬂuctuations coincide approximately with the 8-codon periodicity of the Y /R nature of the third
base (d3 − m3 dependence). Although there is much complex variation due to the ﬁrst base, in
the interests of simplicity, the following ﬁtted function ignores this latter structure, and provides
an approximate (2-parameter) model (see ﬁgure 10):

G6(d1, m1, d2, m2, d3, m3) = 8.298 − 2.716d2 − 0.14(d3 − m3).

(12)

The pattern of amino acid hydrophilicity is also seen to possess an 8-codon periodicity. The
4-parameter ﬁtted function considered, which is plotted in ﬁg. 9, is:

Rf 6(d1, m1, d2, m2, d3, m3) =

0.816 − 0.038d2 − 0.043m2 + 0.022(d3 − m3) + 0.034(1 − d2)d2(d3 − m3)

(13)

As with the case of Grantham polarity, the 8-period extrema might be more ’in phase’ with
the data if codons were weighted according to usage, after the approach of Siemion (Siemion et
al.,1995).

5 Conclusions and outlook

In this paper we have studied codon and amino acid correlations across the genetic code starting
from the simplest algebraic labelling scheme for nucleic acid bases (and hence RNA or DNA
strands more generally). The relationship between the rank ordering of amino acids according
to Siemion number k, k = 1, ..., 64, and a description of codons based on 3 dichotomic labels,
In §2 several dinucleoside properties have been ﬁtted as
had been established (ﬁgures 3,4).
quadratic polynomials of the labels, and §3 and §4 have considered amino acid parameters as
correlated to codons (trinucleotides), namely conformational parameters, Grantham polarity and
hydrophilicity. The types of data considered for ﬁtting in our approach include strictly physical
information (amino acid molecular weight and volume), physico-chemical indices (for example,
the semi-empirical indicators of dinucleoside free energy of formation, and the composite amino
acid Grantham polarity), as well as biological measures (such as the conformational parameters,
which are logarithmic measures of amino acid usage in structural protein elements). As pointed
out in the introductory discussion, all of these measures should be considered as important
aspects in the ‘optimisation’ of the genetic code (see also the remarks in the appendix, §A) In
all cases acceptable algebraic ﬁtting is possible, and various patterns and periodicities in the
data are readily traced to the contribution of speciﬁc monomials in the least-squares ﬁt.

As pointed out in the appendix, §A, our algebraic approach is a special case of more general
dynamical symmetry schemes in which measurable attributes H are given as combinations of
Casimir invariants of certain chains of embedded Lie algebras and superalgebras (Bashford et
al. 1997, 1998; Hornos and Hornos, 1993; Schlesinger et. al 1998; Schlesinger and Kent, 1999;
Forger et al., 1997). The identiﬁcation by Jungck (1978) of two or three major characters, to
which all other properties are strongly correlated, would similarly in the algebraic description
mean the existence of two or three distinct, ‘master’ Hamiltonians H1, H2, H3, . . . (possibly
with diﬀering branching chains). In themselves these could be abstract and need not have a
physical interpretation, but all other properties should be highly correlated to them,

Much has been made of the famous redundancy of the code in providing a key to a group-
theoretical description (Hornos and Hornos, 1993; Forger et al. 1997). In the present framework
(see also Bashford et al., 1997; 1998), codon degeneracies take second place to major features
such as periodicity and other systematic trends across the genetic code. Thus for example the
noted 8-codon periodicity of the conformational parameter P α allows the Y codons for k = 25,
U CY , and k = 63, AGY both to be consistent with ser (as the property attains any given
value twice per 8-codon period, at Y /R box k = 24 + 1 = 25, and again 4 periods later at the
alternative phase k = 56 + 7 = 63).

A related theme is the reconstruction of plausible ancestral codes based on biochemical
and genetic indications of the evolutionary youth of certain parts of the existing code. For
example the anomalous features of arginine, arg which suggests that it is an ‘intruder’ has led
(Jukes, 1973) to the proposal of a more ancient code using ornithine orn instead. This has
been supported by the trigonometric ﬁt to P α (Siemion et al., 1995; Siemion and Stefanowicz,
1996), as the inferred parameters for orn actually match the ﬁtted function better than arg at
the k = 43, k = 61 CGR, AGR codons. Such variations could obviously have some inﬂuence on
the polynomial ﬁtting, but at the present stage have not been implemented§.

To the extent that the present analysis has been successful in suggesting the viability of an
algebraic approach, further work with the intention of establishing (14) in a statistically reliable
fashion may be warranted. What is certainly lacking to date is any microscopic justiﬁcation
for the application of the techniques of dynamical symmetry algebras (but see Bashford et al.,
1997,1998). However, it can be considered that in the path to the genetic code, the primitive
evolving and self-organising system of information storage and directed molecular synthesis
has been subjected to ‘optimisation’ (whether through error minimisation, energy expenditure,
parsimony with raw materials, or several such factors). If furthermore the ‘space’ of possible
codes has the correct topology (compact and convex in some appropriate sense), then it is not
implausible that extremal solutions, and possibly the present code, are associated with special

analysis is directed.

After this work was completed, we received a paper (Frappat et al.,2000) which gives a
similar analysis of dinucleotide properties and correlations between physical-chemical properties
of amino acids and codons based on a particular algebraic scheme (see also Frappat et al., 1998).
It should be emphasized that comparisons of such analyses based merely on the number of ﬁtted
parameters is not particularly illustrative at this preliminary stage. One could modify, for
example, Eq.(2) by cubic or quadratic transformations with the intent to minimise the number
of parameters, but our motivation is to employ physical symmetry properties in an intuitive
way. The number of parameters reﬂects the fact that our analysis has no prior commitment to
any given abstract algebraic scheme. Indeed reproducing the ﬁtted G0

requires a judicous choice of cubic monomial terms.

respondence in the course of the work.

A Appendix: Dynamical symmetry algebras and genetic code

structure

The radical proposal of Hornos and Hornos (1993) to elucidate the genetic code structure us-
ing the methods of dynamical symmetry algebras drew attention to the relationship of certain
symmetry-breaking chains in the Lie algebra C3 ∼ Sp(6) to the fundamental degeneracy pat-
terns of the 64 codons. This theme has been taken up subsequently using various diﬀerent Lie
algebras (Schlesinger et al. 1998; Schlesinger and Kent, 1999; Forger et al.,1997) and also Lie su-
peralgebras (Bashford et al., 1997,1998, Forger and Sachse,1998; Sorba and Sciarrino, 1998). In
addition to possible insights into the code redundancy, a representation-theoretical description
also leads to a code elaboration picture whereby evolutionary primitive, degenerate assignments
of many codons to a few amino acids and larger symmetry algebras gave place, after symmetry
breaking to subalgebras, to the incorporation of more amino acids, each with fewer redundant
codons.

In (Bashford et al., 1997,1998, Jarvis and Bashford, 1998) emphasis was given not to the
patterns of codon redundancy as such, but rather to biochemical factors which have been recog-
nised as fundamental keys to be incorporated in any account of evolution from a primitive coding
system to the present universal one. Among these factors is the primacy of the second base letter
over the ﬁrst and third in correlating with such basic amino acid properties as hydrophilicity
(Woese et al., 1966 ;Volkenstein, 1966). Also, the partial purine/pyrimidine dependence of
the amino acid assignments within a family box further underlines the informational content
of the third codon base (Siemion and Siemion, 1994) and necessitates a symmetry description
which distinguishes the third base letter. In (Bashford et al., 1998) the amino acid degeneracy
was replaced by the weaker condition of anticodon degeneracy, leading to a Lie superalgebra
classiﬁcation scheme using chains of subalgebras of A5,0 ∼ sl(6/1) (see below for details).

A concomitant of any representation-theoretical description of the genetic code is the ‘weight
diagram’ mapping the 64 codons to points of the weight lattice (whose dimension is the rank
of the algebra chosen). Reciprocally, the line of reasoning advocated above and applied in
(Bashford et al., 1998) to the case of Lie superalgebras suggests that any description using
dynamical symmetry algebras must be compatible with the combinatorial fact of the four-letter
alphabet, three-letter word structure of the code. The viewpoint adopted in the present paper
is to explore the implications of generic labelling schemes of this type, independently of the
particular choice of algebra or superalgebra. In particular, as pointed out in §2 above, the weight
diagram is supposed to arise from labelling each of the three base letters of the codon alphabet
with a pair of dichotomic variables. Thus the only technical structural requirement for Lie
algebras and superalgebras compatible with the present work is the existence of a 6-dimensional
maximal abelian (Cartan) subalgebra, and of 64-dimensional irreducible representations whose
weight diagram has the geometry of a six-dimensional hypercube in the weight lattice. (The
relationship between the base alphabet and the Z2 × Z2 Klein four-group has been discussed
by Bertman and Jungck (1979). As examples of a Lie algebra and a Lie superalgebra with this
structure, we here take the case of B6 ∼ SO(13) and A5,0 ∼ sl(6/1) respectively (other examples
would be SO(4)3, sl(2/1)3).

The orthogonal algebra SO(14) has been suggested (Schlesinger et al., 1998) as a unifying
scheme for variants of the Sp(6) models (Hornos and Hornos,1993; Forger et al.,1997). However,
from the present perspective, it is suﬃcient to take spinor representations of the rank-6 odd
orthogonal algebra SO(13) which have dimension 64. Consider the subalgebra chain

being distinguished as a spinor ( 1
4 ). The same pattern repeats for the ﬁrst
codon base SO(1)
4 providing a complete labelling of the 16 family boxes (ﬁxed ﬁrst and second
base letter). The last stage gives two possible alternatives for the third base symmetry breaking:
3 × SO(3)
in the ﬁrst, each family box would split into two doublets ( 1

of anticodon usage is seen, whereas in the vertebrate mitochondrial code, only partial 4 → 2 + 2
family box splitting of anticodon usage is found (see below). Finally, the above labels are all
(up to normalisation) of the form (0, ±1) or (±1, 0) for each base letter (or (±1, ±1) for the
third base for one branching) showing that this group-theoretical scheme does indeed give a
hypercubic geometry for the codon weight diagram.

The sl(6/1) superalgebra was advocated in a survey of possible Lie superalgebras relevant to
the genetic code (Bashford et al. 1997,1998), and possesses irreducible, typical representations
of dimension 64 which share many of the properties of spinor representations of orthogonal Lie
algebras (in the family sln/1 of Lie superalgebras this class of representations has dimension 2n)
and so can be compared with spinors of the even- and odd-dimensional Lie algebras of rank
n, namely SO2n and SO2n+1 respectively). The superalgebra branching chain related to the
SO(13) chain described above is

sl6/1 ⊃ sl(2)

where the last two steps correspond as above either to family box breaking to Y /R doublets
(as in many of the anticodon assignments of the vertebrate mitochondrial code) or to a 4 →
2 + 1 + 1 pattern (as in the anticodons of the eukaryotic code). The nature of the weight
diagram follows from knowledge of the branching in each of the above embeddings. In fact both
in the decomposition of the irreducible 64 to families of 16, and in that of the 16 to family
boxes of 4, there are a doublet and two singlets of the accompanying sl2
1 algebras,
so that the diagonal Cartan element (magnetic quantum number) has the spectrum 0, ± 1
2 . A
second diagonal label arises because there is also an additional commuting U1 generator at each
stage with value ±1 on the two singlets and 0 on the doublet. Alternatively, the additional
label may be taken as the ±1 or 0 shift in the noninteger Dynkin label of the commuting sln/1
algebra (n = 4 and n = 2 respectively). Similar considerations apply to the last branching stage
(Bashford et al., 1998), so that again the weight diagram has the hypercubic geometry assumed
in the text of the paper.

2 and sl2

In the dynamical symmetry algebra approach to problems of complex spectra, important
physical quantities such as the energy levels of the system, and the transition probabilities for
decays, are modelled as matrix elements of certain operators belonging to the Lie algebra or
superalgebra. In particular, the Hamiltonian operator which determines the energy is assumed
to be a linear combination of a set of invariants of a chain of subalgebras G ⊃ G1 ⊃ G2 ⊃ · · · T :

H = c1Γ1 + c2Γ2 + · · · + cT ΓT

for coeﬃcients ci to be determined. For states in a certain representation of the algebra G, the
energy can often be evaluated once the hierarchy of representations of ⊃ G1 ⊃ G2 ⊃ · · · T to
which they belong is identiﬁed, as the invariants are functions of the corresponding representation
labels.

As has been emphasised above, the discussion of ﬁtting of codon and amino acid properties in
the main body of the paper is independent of speciﬁc choices of Lie algebras or superalgebras. In
fact, the polynomial functions of the 6 codon coordinates may simply be regarded as generalised
invariants of the smallest subalgebra common to all cases, namely the 6-dimensional Cartan
(maximal abelian) subalgebra T (so that there are several nonzero coeﬃcients cT , with all other
ci zero). This approach is thus complementary to detailed applications of a chosen symmetry
algebra, where the coeﬃcients ci (including cT ) might accompany a speciﬁc set of Γi (functions
of the whole hierarchy of labels, whose form is ﬁxed, depending on the subalgebra). However,
because the weight labels used in the present work already provide an unambiguous identiﬁcation
of the 64 states, such functions of any possible additional labels are in principle determined as
cases of the general expansions we have been studying. For this reason the present work, although
deliberately of a generic nature, does indeed conﬁrm the viability of the dynamical symmetry
approach.

Abstract

Stochastic Resonance in single voltage-dependent ion channels is investigated within a three state

non-Markovian modeling of the ion channel conformational dynamics. In contrast to a two-state

description one assumes the presence of an additional closed state for the ion channel which mimics

the manifold of voltage-independent closed subconformations (inactivated “state”). The confor-

mational transition into the open state occurs through a domain of voltage-dependent closed sub-

conformations (closed “state”). At distinct variance with a standard two-state or also three-state

Markovian approach, the inactivated state is characterized by a broad, non-exponential probability

distribution of corresponding residence times. The linear response to a periodic voltage signal is de-

termined for arbitrary distributions of the channel’s recovery times. Analytical results are obtained

for the spectral ampliﬁcation of the applied signal and the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio. Al-

ternatively, these results are also derived by use of a corresponding two-state non-Markovian theory

which is based on driven integral renewal equations [I. Goychuk and P. H¨anggi, Phys. Rev. E 69,

021104 (2004)]. The non-Markovian features of stochastic resonance are studied for a power law

distribution of the residence time-intervals in the inactivated state which exhibits a large variance.

A comparison with the case of bi-exponentially distributed residence times possessing the same

mean value, i.e. a simplest non-Markovian two-state description, is also presented.

INTRODUCTION

Stochastic resonance (SR) [1, 2] is by now a well-established phenomenon with wide

spread applications in physics, chemistry, engineering sciences and the life sciences. It refers

to the fact that in nonlinear stochastic systems an optimal level of applied or intrinsic noise

can dramatically boost the response (or, more generally, the transport) to typically weak,

time-dependent input signals. This fact plays a prominent role in biology with its abundance

of a variety of threshold-like systems that are subjected to noise inﬂuences [1, 2, 3, 4]. SR

is often also characterized in terms of an underlying stochastic synchronization between an

applied stimulus and an intrinsically stochastic dynamics [1, 2, 5]. From the viewpoint of

physical biology, the phenomenon of SR in biological sensory systems is commonly assumed

to be rooted in the properties of excitable membranes. This being so, it ultimately can be

explained in terms of a driven stochastic dynamics of assemblies of ion channels [6, 7, 8, 9,

10, 11, 12, 13]. Although biologically relevant SR is generally a property of a cooperative

coupling among ion channels [11, 12, 13], the study of stochastic resonance in single ion

channels carries merit on its own: (1) SR has not yet been convincingly demonstrated on

the level of single molecules, with biological ion channels being such proper candidates [7];

(2) ion channels can serve as suitable single-molecular sensors to be utilized in nanodevices.

All these facts in turn have stimulated a vivid interest on this subject matter. Inspecting

the recordings of ion current ﬂowing through a single ion channel, as obtained from a typical

patch clamp experiment [14, 15], bears close similarity with a simple, driven bistable dynam-

ics [1, 2, 16]. The occurrence of SR in single ion channels thus seems very likely. In reality,

the situation is, however, more complex, because (i) the dependence of the opening and clos-

ing rates on the voltage and temperature are generally not Arrhenius-like [17, 18, 19, 20];

a characteristic feature which plays a central role for the occurrence, or non-occurrence of

the SR [9], and (ii) the detailed studies of the statistics of the ion current switching events

reveals that the probability distributions of the residence time intervals in diﬀerent conduc-

tance states are normally not single exponential. This implies that the observed dynamics of

“on-oﬀ” conductance ﬂuctuations is generically non-Markovian within a two-state stochas-

tic description [21, 22]. In the simplest nontrivial case of a bi-exponential distribution of

the residence time intervals dwelled in the nonconducting conformation, the emerging non-

Markovian dynamics can be embedded into a three state Markovian dynamics [15] with an

2

extra (visually indistinguishable) closed state. The presence of such a third state (or, more

generally, a number of additional substates) can, however, be inferred from the bursting

character of the observed dynamics when the ion channel dynamics after switching between

its open and closed states for a number of times suddenly stops, and then revives again later

after a notably longer time span has elapsed (as compared with the typical sojourn length

in the open, or closed state). The presence of such a third state can be considered as a

closed inactivated state. This “third” state in fact does not constitute a single state, but

rather a manifold of many substates. As a consequence, the recovery of ion channel from

its inactive state does not present an exponential rate process, but will be governed by a

nonexponential distribution of corresponding residence times. This feature, i.e. the absence

of a well deﬁned time scale for recovery from inactivation can be observed in various ion

channels [23].

Our main objective here is to investigate the basic features of SR occurring in single

ion channels within the framework of a three state non-Markovian dynamics. In addition,

we contrast this approach with the two-state non-Markovian theory of stochastic resonance

developed in prior works [24, 25].

II. MODEL SETUP

Following the reasoning put forward in Refs. [19, 20] we consider a discrete state model

of ion channel gating, whose essentials are depicted with Fig. 1. It consists of three “states”:

an open one (O), a closed one (C) and an inactivated state (I). The inactivated state I

is assumed to correspond to the manifold of voltage-insensitive conformations of the ion

channel protein and the opening C → O and closing O → C transitions are associated with

the motion of a voltage sensor and the opening/closing of the channel’s gate. The stochastic

transitions between the open and closed states are characterized by generally time-dependent

opening and closing rates, ko(t) and kc(t), respectively. These rates are assumed to depend

on an externally applied, time-dependent voltage signal.

In the spirit of the modeling put forward in [19, 20, 26, 27, 28, 29] we assume that in-

activation occurs from the closed state of the ion channel. In doing so, we are dealing with

an archetype model of gating with opening, closing and inactivation dynamics [14]. Fur-

thermore, unlike in the standard Markovian modeling [14, 15] we assume that the transition

from the inactivated, voltage-independent state to the closed state is not rate-limited, but

rather is characterized by a broad distribution of rates. Put diﬀerently, we model the step

from inactivation towards the closing state, cf. Fig. 1 by a non-exponential distribution

ψ(τ ) of the residence time-intervals dwelled in the inactivated state. This distribution will

be assumed to possess a ﬁnite average hτri :=

∞
0 τ ψ(τ )dτ . It is voltage-independent but
arbitrary otherwise. Furthermore, it is assumed that the channel’s inactivation occurs from

R

the closed state with a voltage-independent rate kin. The voltage-independence of I ↔ C

transitions follows from the underlying character of conformational dynamics: Namely, one

assumes that the I ↔ C transitions occur in a direction being transverse to the direction

of C ↔ O transitions [20]. These latter transitions are tight to the relocation of the gat-

ing charge across the membrane, while the former transitions are not related to a charge

redistribution; for further details we refer the reader to the discussion in Ref. [20].

This chosen distribution of rates accounts for the fact that for several types of ion channels

the recovery process does not have a well deﬁned time scale [23]. This circumstance in turn

implies that the gating process is non-Markovian within our three state description. The

standard Markovian three-state description is recovered when ψ(τ ) = kr exp(−krτ ), where
kr := hτri−1 is the rate of the I → C transition.

III. NON-MARKOV THEORY OF THREE-STATE GATING

The time evolution for the probabilities to occupy the open, closed or the inactivated

state, po(t), pc(t) and pI(t), respectively, is governed by the following generalized master

4

equations:

˙po(t) = ko(t)pc(t) − kc(t)po(t) ,

˙pc(t) = −(kin + ko(t))pc(t) + kc(t)po(t) +

Γ(t − t′)pI(t′)dt′ ,

t

Z

˙pI(t) = kinpc(t) −

Γ(t − t′)pI(t′)dt′ .

The Laplace-transformed kernel Γ(t) reads:

˜Γ(s) =

s ˜ψ(s)
1 − ˜ψ(s)

,

(1)

(2)

with ˜ψ(s) denoting the Laplace transform of ψ(τ ) (“tilde” denotes throughout the Laplace

transform of a corresponding function). The solution depends also on the initial condition,

chosen for example to read, pc(t0) = 1, at initial time t = t0.

This set of equations can formally be derived following the approaches in Refs. [25, 30,

31, 32, 33]. Alternatively, this very set of non-Markovian evolution eqs. can be obtained

more directly as well: The terms not expected from naive grounds in Eq.(1) are the ones that

involve memory. Let us assume that the ion channel is prepared in the state I, pI(0) = 1

at t0 = 0 and impose kin → 0, i.e. no returns are possible. Then, the leakage of probability

pI(t) is due to the transition into the state C, i.e. pI(t) must equal (with such an absorbing

boundary condition) the survival probability Φ(t) =
by ˙Φ(t) = −

∞
t ψ(τ )dτ . With this leakage given
0 Γ(t − t′)Φ(t′)dt′ we readily ﬁnd by use of the Laplace transform method the
relation in Eq.(2). The description in Eq.(1) portrays a driven (i.e. inhomogeneous in time)

Note in particular that ψo(t + τ, t) and ψc(t + τ, t) depend not only on the length of residence

time intervals τ , but also on the entrance time point t. We refer the reader to Ref.

[25]

for a detailed trajectory description of such driven renewal processes. These conditioned,

nonstationary two-time RTDs ψj(τ |t) := ψj(t + τ, t) (j = o, c) are given as the negative time

5

derivatives of the corresponding survival probabilities Φj(τ |t) := Φj(t + τ, t); i.e. ψj(τ |t) :=

−dΦj(τ |t)/dτ .

The averaged, time-dependent conductance g(t) of the considered ion channel reads

hg(t)i = po(t)go + (pc(t) + pI(t))gc, where go and gc are the conductances of the open and

closed conformations, respectively.

In the absence of a time-dependent signal, hg(t)i =

hgist = pst

o go + (pst

c + pst

I )gc, where pst

α with α = o, c, I is the stationary solution of Eq. (1) in

the absence of driving. For the following we assume a periodic voltage signal given by

Vs(t) = A cos(Ωt).

The mean deviation of the channel conductance hδg(t)i := hg(t)i − hgist from its stationary

value thus reads at asymptotic times within a linear response approximation [1],

hδg(t)i = A| ˜χ(Ω)| cos(Ωt − ϕ(Ω)) ,

where ϕ(Ω) is the corresponding phase shift [1, 29]. In (5), ˜χ(Ω) denotes the linear response

function in the frequency domain. The linear response result for the spectral ampliﬁcation

(SPA) of the signal η(Ω) is given by η(Ω) = | ˜χ(Ω)|2 [1].

A. Linear response theory

In order to evaluate the linear response function we expand the solution of Eq.(1) as

pc(t) =

∞
k=−∞ rk(t) exp(−ikΩt) and po(t) =

∞
k=−∞ qk(t) exp(−ikΩt). The solution for
pI(t) follows by virtue of probability conservation, i.e., pI(t) = 1 − po(t) − pc(t). In the limit

t → ∞ the solutions become time-periodic [1, 16] with time-independent coeﬃcients rk and

qk which depend on the amplitude strength A and frequency Ω. The asymptotic, nonlinear

periodic solution thus reads

The linear response function ˜χ(Ω) is encoded in the ﬁrst Fourier term [29]. It reads,

0 + O(A2) where {q(0)

RTD in the set of compound closed states, when no time-dependent signal acts, i.e. Vs(t) = 0.

This auxiliary quantity is obtained as follows: The channel is prepared in the closed state

C at t0 = 0, i.e., pc(0) = 1 and the back transition O → C is set to zero by imposing

kc → 0. Then, the solution of the ﬁrst two equations in (1) in the absence of driving yields

the stationary survival probability of the compound closed states as Φc′(t) = pc(t) + pI(t)

and ψc′(t) follows as ψc′(τ ) = −dΦc′(τ )/dτ . Using this scheme we ﬁnd,

Furthermore, hτc′i in Eq. (17) follows from Eq. (18) as hτc′i = ˜Φc′(0).

Let us introduce also the auxiliary function

˜G(s) =

(1 − ˜ψo(s))(1 − ˜ψc′(s))
1 − ˜ψo(s) ˜ψc′(s)

,

where ˜ψo(s) = k(0)

c /(s + k(0)

time intervals. Then, Eq. (15) can be rewritten in a more compact form as

|V =V0 = βo and

the result in Eq. (22) coincides with the result of the phenomenological two-state theory of

non-Markovian SR put forward in [24, 25]. Upon combining with Eq. (7), Eq. (22) yields

the linear response result

˜χ(Ω) =

(βc − βo)∆g

which in fact coincides with Eq. (61) in Ref. [25].

The just outlined procedure can as well be extended into the nonlinear response regime to

obtain nonlinear response functions of required order in the signal amplitude. This, however,

is beyond the scope of this work. This central result in Eq.(23) is alternatively derived in

Appendix A by making use of the two-state non-Markovian theory detailed in Ref. [29].

B. Explicit results in terms of thermodynamic free energies

We next introduce formally the eﬀective free energy bias ǫ(T ), i.e.,

(25)

Using that ∆Go(V0) = G# − Gc and ∆Gc(V0) = G# − Go, where G# is the free energy of the

transition state, and Go,c = Ho,c − T So,c is the free energy of the open (closed) conformation,

Eq.(25) can be recast as

ǫ(T ) = ∆H − T ∆S + kBT ln(1 + kinhτri) ,

(26)

where ∆H := Ho − Hc is the diﬀerence of thermodynamic enthalpies of the open and closed

conformations (or of the internal energies, if no volume change of the macromolecule occurs

at the conformational transition) and ∆S := So − Sc is the corresponding entropy diﬀerence.

Assuming that the free energy barriers in Eq. (8) have linear dependence of voltage,

∆Go(V ) = ∆Go − q(1 − δ)V and ∆Gc(V ) = ∆Gc + qδ V , where q is the gating charge

and 0 < δ < 1 is a constant [14, 20], we ﬁnd that βc − βo = −q/(kBT ). For the spectral

ampliﬁcation of the conductance response η = | ˜χ(Ω)|2 we obtain then from Eq. (23) our

ﬁrst main result

η(Ω, T ) =

with ǫ(T ) given in Eq. (25), while ν(T ) = hτoi−1 + hτc′i−1 denotes the sum of the closing

The result in Eq.(27) coincides, apart from a model speciﬁc constant, with the expression

given in Ref.

[24], cf. Eq.(25) therein. Within the linear response approximation the

corresponding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the angular driving frequency Ω is obtained

from RSN (Ω, T ) := πA2η/SN (ω = Ω), where SN (ω) denotes the spectral power density of

conductance ﬂuctuations in the absence of signal Vs(t). By use of the Stratonovich formula

for the autocorrelation function of the alternating renewal process [35] and the Wiener-

Khinchin theorem one ﬁnds for SN (ω) [25, 35]

This result holds in the presence of asymmetry with nonvanishing ǫ(T ).

In such a case,

the SPA (32) can exhibit a sharp stochastic resonance at the physiologically relevant tem-

peratures when ǫ(T ) changes sign, when the probabilities of the channel to be open, or to

stay close become equal. This corresponds to the opening threshold for the detailed below

case of an ion channel sensitive to cold (or, vice versa, sensitive to heat, if the open state

is preferred from an entropic viewpoint). The cold-sensitive, or heat-sensitive ion channels

[36] present appropriate candidates to reveal this entropic-SR eﬀect. This feature at very

small driving frequencies, which mimics a Markovian behavior, has thus nothing to do with

non-Markovian properties; it is solely due to an entropic asymmetry. The non-Markovian

eﬀects emerge, however, at small, but ﬁnite frequencies in the corresponding SPA-curves, see

in Ref.[24]. Most prominent non-Markovian, long-time memory eﬀects distinctly suppress,

however, the SNR in the low-frequency domain [24, 25]. For Ω → 0, we obtain (with Co = 1)

0 < α < 1 considered below. This suppression occurs due to 1/f 1−α noise feature in the

spectral power SN (Ω) for small frequencies. Let us illustrate now these general considerations

with two particular models.

ION CHANNEL GATING: BI-EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION VERSUS A

POWER LAW

The current three state model provides a suitable framework to clarify the role of a power-

law distributed residence times in the inactivated and closed states as compared with the

simplest two-state non-Markovian situation (with respect to the observable dynamics) of a

bi-exponential distribution, that, likewise, can be embedded into a three-state Markovian

description.

(20) yields

A. The case of a bi-exponential distribution

We start our driven channel gating investigation with the simplest case of an exponential

residence time distribution of the transition I → C, i.e., ψ(τ ) = kr exp(−krτ ). Then, Eq.

˜ψc′(s) =

k(0)
o (s + kr)
(s + k(0)
o )(s + kr) + kins

.

The inversion of Eq. (34) yields a bi-exponential probability density, i.e.,

ψc′(τ ) = c1λ1 exp(−λ1τ ) + c2λ2 exp(−λ2τ )

with the rate coeﬃcients λ1,2 = 1

The mean residence time corresponding to this RTD (35) is

(cid:18)

Such a non-exponential, i.e. bi-exponential RTD can actually be very broad as characterized

by the corresponding coeﬃcient of variation C :=

hτ 2i − hτ i2/hτ i, yielding from (35)

Indeed, for kr ≪ kin ≪ k(0)

implies that the distribution (35) has a small, but very broad long-time tail, which in turn re-

sults in a large variance of the residence times. This ﬁnding carries important consequences:

As shown in Refs. [24, 25] the signal-to-noise ratio RSN is then strongly suppressed in the
low-frequency limit Ω → 0 by the factor 1/N(0) = 1

variation for ψo(τ ), Co = 1 in the present case. This presents a ﬁrst manifest non-Markovian

that the auxiliary function ˜G(s) can be recast as

Arrhenius rates kin = ν0 exp(−∆Gin/kBT ) and kr = ν0 exp[−∆Gr/kBT ] [37].

The results in Eq.(40) and (41) constitute central results for the SR occurring in a three

state Markovian model of gating in ion channels possessing an inactivation from the closed

state. At the same time, these results correspond to a simplest non-Markovian two-state

model of the observable dynamics of conductance ﬂuctuations.

We performed numerical calculations for the set of test parameters given in the Table I

which is chosen to mimic the experimental temperature dependence of the cold-sensitive ion

channels, see in Ref. [36].

the gas constant R = kBNA in the rate expressions, respectively) to a value, ∆Hc ≈ 2.91·10−19 J ≈ 1.81 eV,

The temperature-dependence of the corresponding Markovian transition rates are given

in Fig. 2(a). For this set of parameters, the coeﬃcient of variation of the closed residence

time (compound state) within the three-state Markovian description is Cc′ ≈ 17.14 and

the low-frequency SNR is suppressed by the factor of 1/N(0) ≈ 147.43 as compared with

Its temperature-dependence is depicted in Fig. 2(b). The frequency prefactor ν0 has been
taken to be ν0 = 6.11 · 1012 s−1. This value corresponds approximately to a gas-phase
value of kBT /h at T = 20oC. It clearly overestimates any eﬀects that relate to friction and

other details determining the transmission coeﬃcient κ in condensed phases. The correct

estimation of this prefactor would require a more elaborate theory of the Kramers type

[37] rather than Absolute Rate Theory used here. Nevertheless, this ambiguity does not

play role if to assume that the frequency prefactor ν0 is one and the same for all the rate

parameters. This is so because a diﬀerent value of ν0 would result in one and the same

(unknown) systematic entropy correction for all metastable states. The entropy diﬀerences

between the metastable states remain unchanged.

Our results for this choice of parameters are depicted in Fig. 3(a) for the spectral ampli-

ﬁcation η, and Fig. 3(b) for the corresponding signal-to noise ratio RSN . In particular, Fig.

3(a) convincingly demonstrates the possibility of Stochastic Resonance within the range of

physiological temperatures when ǫ(T ) ≈ 0, in accordance with Eq. (32). The SNR in Fig.

unrealistic high temperatures of about 600 oC. This resonance behavior is formally contained

in Eq. (33) (notice the presence of ν(T ) in the numerator there, which invalidates the cri-

c′ +1)/2. Surprisingly (in view of the rather
large enthalpic barriers), this does not exclude the appearance of Stochastic Resonance in

the SNR-behavior at physiological temperatures at some intermediately high frequency of

the signal. For the studied model system this occurs, for example, for Ω = 104 s−1 (this

feature is not depicted because the accompanying spectral ampliﬁcation η(T ) in Fig. 3(a)

emerges to be extremely small).

B. The case with a power law distribution

To model the gating dynamics more realistically we next consider a description with

a nontrivial nonexponential residence time distribution in the inactivated regime ψ(τ ) in

Eq.(28). In particular, we use a probability density ψ(τ ) with the following characteristic

function [29]

where

˜ψ(s) =

1
1 + shτrigα(sτd)

,

gα(z) =

tanh(zα/2)
zα/2

.

(42)

(43)

The RTD (42) has been obtained in Ref.[29] as solution of a conformational diﬀusion

model accounting for an anomalous subdiﬀusion over energetically quasi-degenerate sub-

states within the given conformation, i.e. I in the present work. This probability density

possesses three parameters: the mean residence time hτri in this inactivated conformation,

the conformational diﬀusion time τd and the index of subdiﬀusion α, 0 < α ≤ 1.

In spite of possessing three independent parameters only, the RTD (42) is capable to

display a rich behavior. The case of single-exponential distribution with the rate parameter

kr := hτri−1 is rendered for τd = 0. The case α = 1 corresponds to normal diﬀusion. For

τd ≪ hτri, the intra-conformational diﬀusion eﬀects are not essential. However, for τd ≫ hτri
and in the range hτri2/τd ≪ τ ≪ τd the corresponding RTD assumes a negative power law,
i.e., ψ(τ ) ∝ τ −3/2, which ends up in an exponential tail for τ > τd [19]. For α < 1, the
distribution (42) has an inﬁnite variance, since hτ 2i = ∞ for any τd 6= 0 and, depending on

a subtle interplay of parameters, it can display up to three diﬀerent power laws. These are:

ψ(τ ) ∝ τ −α/2 initially, ψ(τ ) ∝ τ −(2−α/2) intermediately, and ψ(τ ) ∝ τ −(2+α) asymptotically

17

[29]. With the discussed choice of ψ(τ ), the characteristic function of the RTD in the

compound C ′ state reads

(44)

(45)

˜ψc′(s) =

k(0)
o (sgα(sτd) + kr)

(s + k(0)

Note that for α < 1, Cc′ = ∞. This implies that the detection of low-frequency signals Ω → 0

is fully suppressed as RSN (Ω) → 0 at Ω → 0 [24, 25]. A bistable stochastic element with such

properties can thus be used as a high-pass ﬁlter for the signal transduction. In this case, the
ﬁrst leading terms of the small-s expansion of ˜ψc′(s) read ˜ψc′(s) ≈ 1−hτc′is+ 1

This corresponds asymptotically to a distribution, ψc′(τ ) ∝ τ −(2+α), similar to the Pareto

law behavior considered in Refs. [24, 25].

With (42) in Eqs. (28), (27) and (30) one can evaluate the spectral ampliﬁcation of signal

and the signal-to-noise ratio. We did this for the above set of thermodynamical parameters

(see in Table I) entering rates which is supplemented with the following parameters of the

RTD in Eq. (42): α = 0.25, τd = 0.1 s. As it can be seen in Fig. 4(a), the non-Markovian

eﬀects resolve the lines at the frequencies Ω = 0.1 s−1 and Ω = 1 s−1 which merge with

the zero-frequency line in Fig. 3(a). Moreover, the diﬀerent lines which merge in Fig. 3(b)

become also resolved, see in Fig.4(b), where upon increasing the angular frequency Ω the

SNR RSN (Ω, T ) grows. Namely, at zero frequency RSN (Ω → 0, T ) = 0 and for Ω ≈ 100 s−1

RSN (Ω, T ) reaches approximately (from below) its low-frequency three state Markovian limit

in Fig. 3(b). With the further increase of Ω SNR will, however, grow further approaching

asymptotically the two state Markovian limit, where the non-Markovian form factor assumes

unity, i.e. N(Ω) = 1. It is worth noticing that for the two lower curves in Fig. 4(b) the

SNR seemingly saturates with increasing temperature. In fact, however, the SR-behavior

exhibits a rather broad maximum. The occurrence of this maximum is quite surprising (see

the discussion at the end of the subsection IV.A) and is due to non-Markovian eﬀects.

Moreover, at variance with the SNR behavior (where the SNR increases with increasing

angular frequency of signal) the corresponding SPA diminishes with increasing angular fre-

quency. Therefore, we do not observe an intermediate frequency regime which would prove

optimal for the detection of non-Markovian SR.

FIG. 4: The case with a power law distribution of residence times for three-state ion channel

gating, cf. Fig 1. Instead of a single-exponential RTD ψ(τ ), the residence time distribution in the

inactivated state is given now by Eq. (42) with α = 0.25 and τd = 0.1 s. The other parameters

remain the same as in Fig. 3. The manifest non-Markovian eﬀects result in a resolution of the

diﬀerent lines that merged in Fig. 3. Note in part (b) that the signal to noise ratio is fully

suppressed towards zero for Ω → 0 (the result merges with the horizontal axis). The adiabatic

limit of the corresponding Markovian three-state model is approximately assumed at Ω = 100 s−1;

cf. the dotted line in (b) which compares with the solid line in Fig. 3(b).

V. RESUME

With this work we have investigated Stochastic Resonance in a three state non-Markovian

model of ion channel gating. We note that our scheme of a three-state non-Markovian mod-

eling is distinctly diﬀerent from a similar one, recently applied to an excitable neuronal

19

dynamics [38, 39]. The latter model assumes a three state system which cycles unidirection-

ally between three states, 1 (silent), 2 (excited) and 3 (refractory), i.e., 1 → 2 → 3 → 1.

This unidirectional cycling corresponds to processes that are very far from the thermal equi-

librium and which require a continuous supply of free energy. In contrast, our modeling is

compatible with the thermal equilibrium. The ion channel gating is commonly assumed to

be a thermal equilibrium process [14]. This is in contrast to the situation with ion pumps

and neuronal systems which do require a free energy supply for proper functioning. As it

has been shown in this work, our three state description is compatible with the phenomeno-

logical two-state theory of non-Markovian Stochastic Resonance put forward in Ref.

[24],

while the non-equilibrium, three-state model of Ref. [39] is not within this class of system

behaviors [25]. Nevertheless, the result of Ref.

[39] for the spectral power ampliﬁcation

can be reproduced from our Eq. (A1) by specifying the RTD of the compound silent state

(i.e. the silent state plus the refractory state) as a time-convolution of two corresponding

residence time probability densities and expanding it like in Eq. (A2). In other words, the

model of Ref.

[39] can be recovered as a special case within our general nonequilibrium

approach put forward in Ref. [25], cf. section IV therein.

In conclusion, the non-Markovian SR eﬀects such as the suppression of the signal-to-noise

ratio for low-frequency signals and the resolution of diﬀerent signal frequencies in the spectral

ampliﬁcation of signal in the presence of possibly large (entropic) asymmetries can be nicely

modeled already within a three state Markovian model. Such a three state Markovian

model yields the simplest non-Markovian model after the corresponding projection onto the

subspace of two observable states. The signal-to-noise ratio remains, however, ﬁnite in the

limit of the zero-frequency signal. Its complete suppression requires an inﬁnite variance of

the residence time intervals in the inactivated state. For such a manifest non-Markovian SR-

behavior, weak external oscillating signals with an intermediate frequency should be used

in order to detect SR experimentally.

Our present results provide a theoretical proof for the occurrence of Stochastic Resonance

in single biomolecules at physiological temperatures. This being so, our ﬁndings can guide

the experimentalists to choose both, the appropriate molecules for doing experiments and

to identify the corresponding experimental parameter regime which in turn will reveal the

SR-phenomenon in a single ion channel. Presently there exist only very few experimental,

ion channel-based SR-works: In Ref.

[7] attempts to identify SR in a single ion channel

20

have been made; the occurrence of SR therein is, however, not convincing. In Ref. [6] one

investigates SR and demonstrates SR. The phenomenon has been studied, however, only on

the level of a small number of dynamically self-assembled alamethicin ion channels.

Our ﬁndings show that ideal candidates to observe experimentally SR on the level of single

molecules are cold (or heat) sensitive ion channels [36]. From this viewpoint, we believe that

a repetition of the experiments in Ref. [7] by resorting to such channels would indeed become

successful for observing SR in a single ion channel operating within its physiological regime.

APPENDIX A: DERIVATION OF LINEAR RESPONSE FUNCTION WITHIN

NON-MARKOVIAN TWO-STATE THEORY

In this Appendix the result in Eq. (23) is re-derived from the non-Markovian two-state

theory of Ref. [25]. Namely, in Ref. [25] it has been shown that the linear response function

of an arbitrary two state renewal process characterized by the conditional RTDs ψj=1,2(τ |t)

and the amplitude of conductance ﬂuctuations ∆g to a periodic signal in Eq. (4) is given in

the limit A → 0 by

In Eq. (A1), ˜ψj(s) denote the Laplace-transforms of stationary the RTDs in the absence
of driving and ˜ψ(1)

j (s) are the Laplace-transforms of the corresponding contributions in the

expansion of the conditional, driven RTDs, i.e.,

ψj(τ |t) =

ψ(n)

The quantities ˜ψ(1)

βjA[1 − ψj(−iΩ)],

j (−iΩ) = −

˜ψ(1)

(A3)

then the result of phenomenological theory in Eq.

(23) is recovered from Eq.

(A1).

For the exponential form of distribution of open residence times ψo(τ |t) = ψ2(τ |t) =
kc(τ ′)dτ ′], the relation (A3) is fulﬁlled. We identify here the state “1”

kc(t + τ ) exp[−

with the compound closed state “(C, I)” and the state “2” with the open state “O”; note

t+τ

R

also that β1 ≡ βo, β2 ≡ βc. This relation is valid as well for a multi-exponential distribu-

tion which assumes a scaling relation among the rate parameters which is not modiﬁed by

driving, i.e. a form-invariant RTD, cf.

[25]. Below we demonstrate that the relation (A3)

is also valid in the present case which obviously does not belong to the latter universality

class. Nevertheless, the application of the phenomenological linear response theory to the

considered non-Markovian processes [24] is justiﬁed.

In order to obtain the conditional survival probability of the compound closed state

with the initial conditions pc(0|t) = 1 and pI(0|t) = 0. Then, Φ1(τ |t) = pc(τ |t) +

pI(τ |t). Asymptotically, the considered periodically driven renewal process becomes cyclic-

stationary. For such a cyclic-stationary process, Φ1(τ |t) must be invariant under time shifts

t → t + nT, n = ±1, ±2, ... with period T = 2π/Ω; it thus can be expanded into Fourier

series like in (A2). With ko(t) being a periodic function of time, we are seeking a solution of

Eq. (A7) determines in combination with Eq. (A6) for n = 0 the stationary (i.e., in the

absence of driving) survival function of the compound closed state in Eq.

(18) and the

corresponding RTD (19), respectively.
Eq.(A8) yields in virtue of ˜p(0)

c (0) = 1/k(0)

o + O(A2) and Eq. (11) the result

Together with Eq. (A6) for n = 1 this gives with βo = β1

Upon using the general relation, ˜ψ(n)

α (s) = δn,0 − s ˜Φ(n)

α (s), Eq. (A10) thus yields the desired

relation in (A3).

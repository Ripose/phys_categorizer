Abstract

As most biological species, photosynthetic lifeforms have evolved to function opti-

mally, despite thermal disorder and with fault tolerance. It remains a challenge to under-

stand how this is achieved. To address this challenge the function of the protein-pigment

complex photosystem I (PSI) of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus is inves-

tigated theoretically. The recently obtained high resolution structure of this complex

exhibits an aggregate of 96 chlorophylls that are electronically coupled to function as a

light-harvesting antenna complex. This paper constructs an eﬀective Hamiltonian for the

chlorophyll aggregate to describe excitation transfer dynamics and spectral properties of

PSI. For this purpose, a new kinetic expansion method, the sojourn expansion, is intro-

duced. Our study shows that at room temperature ﬂuctuations of site energies have little

eﬀect on the calculated excitation lifetime and quantum yield, which compare favorably

with experimental results. The eﬃciency of the system is found to be robust against

‘pruning’ of individual chlorophylls. An optimality of the arrangement of chlorophylls is

identiﬁed through the quantum yield in comparison with an ensemble of randomly ori-

ented chlorophylls, though, the quantum yield is seen to change only within a narrow

interval in such an ensemble.

1 Introduction

Photosynthesis is the main source of energy in our biosphere. Although light-harvesting

systems show a great variety in their design and function, most of them are membrane

proteins comprised of a network of pigment antennae surrounding a reaction center [1].

The antenna complex is responsible for the absorption of light and the transfer of the

resulting electronic excitation to a so-called special pair of chlorophylls in the reaction

center, where a charge separation across the cell membrane is initiated. This charge

separation is later utilized by the cell to store energy through synthesis of ATP in a more

stable form.

Oxygenic photosynthetic species employ two transmembrane protein-pigment com-

plexes for light-harvesting, named photosystems I and II. Photosystem I (PSI) is a ubiq-

uitous protein-pigment complex found in green plants, algae and cyanobacteria. Located

in the bacterial membrane, it absorbs sun light and uses its energy to transfer electrons

across the cell membrane. PSI is remarkable in that it contains the antenna complex,

reaction center and the electron transfer chain all within the same protein. For a recent

review on PSI physiology and function we refer the reader to Refs. [2, 3, 4].

A high resolution atomic structure was recently obtained for PSI from the cyanobac-

terium Synechococcus (S.) elongatus [5]. The structure exhibits an aggregate of 96 chloro-

phyll molecules, including the special pair, P700, at which the primary charge separation

takes place. This ﬁnding opens up the opportunity to study in detail the light-harvesting

function of PSI, i.e., one can computationally examine the light-harvesting pathway from

initial absorption of a photon to the transfer of electrons by the special pair. In the past,

a similar leap in structural information on the peripheral light-harvesting complexes LH1

and LH2 of purple bacteria resulted in the photosynthetic unit of purple bacteria being

the best understood antenna complex today [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

It is of interest to compare the structure and function of PSI to the photosynthetic

unit of purple bacteria. Both systems contain on the order of a hundred chromophores per

reaction center. In purple bacteria these chromophores are organized in highly symmetric

ring-like structures [11, 12, 13].

In contrast, the chlorophyll aggregate in PSI forms a

rather random array surrounding the reaction center (see Fig. 1), the only hint of order

being a pseudo-C2 symmetry apparent in the structure.

2

Purple bacteria have the oldest known photosynthetic apparatus, while cyanobacteria

and their relatives are evolutionarily more recent [14, 15]. It is of interest to compare

the light-harvesting systems of these lifeforms and to elucidate the drive toward a more

eﬃcient system in the more recently developed light-harvesting complexes.

A related issue is whether the peculiar arrangement of chlorophylls found in the re-

ported structure is essential for the functioning of PSI or whether the system can be

described successfully assuming some degree of randomness. For example, is every single

chlorophyll essential for the proper functioning of the system? This question also consti-

tutes a modeling challenge. Due to its circular symmetry and repetitive elements a purple

bacterial light-harvesting complex can be modeled with only a few physical parameters

describing chlorophyll site energies and electronic couplings [10, 16, 17]. PSI, on the other

hand, features 96 chlorophylls that show few regularities and seemingly require a large

number of parameters for their description.

There are two possible ways to approach the complexity of the chlorophyll aggregate

in PSI. In one approach, typically taken in chemistry, one strives for an ever increasing

accuracy in a model through a large number of speciﬁc parameters. This approach implies

that the speciﬁc properties of every one of the 96 chlorophylls in PSI matter. In another

approach, typically taken in physics, one identiﬁes a minimal set of characteristics, e.g.,

average properties of the 96 chlorophylls, relevant for the description of function and

observed spectra.

The most relevant functional property of PSI is its high eﬃciency in using excitation

energy for charge separation in the reaction center despite thermal disorder and ever

present internal damage. One seeks to know how robust PSI is against perturbations

such as ‘pruning’ or ‘bleaching’ of individual chlorophylls or changes in the protein that

eﬀect chlorophyll site energies. Robustness in biology is not a new concept. The issue

was addressed earlier in Refs. [18, 19] and, recently in the study of biochemical networks

involved in bacterial chemotaxis [20, 21]. These studies suggest that biological networks

exhibit a high degree of insensitivity to ﬁne-tuning of physical parameters.

Another issue of interest is the optimality of the design of the chlorophyll aggregate

in PSI. Is it possible to rearrange or reorient the pigments in PSI to achieve a better

quantum yield or did evolution establish an optimal arrangement? This is likely easier to

3

answer in silico than in vivo.

While the issues of robustness and optimality can be addressed well by the physi-

cists’ approach, details of the low temperature excitation transfer dynamics and spectral

features are likely better studied by the chemists’ approach. The longest wavelength fea-

tures of the spectrum attributed to so-called ‘red chlorophylls’ are an example of this.

Red chlorophylls are responsible for broadening the absorption proﬁle of PSI, but their

role is not fully understood. For a review we refer the reader to Ref. [2].

In order to answer the questions raised above we study ensembles of various chlorophyll

arrangements. This permits us to investigate the dependence of the light harvesting

function of PSI in detailed or coarse descriptions as well as the robustness and optimality

of the system. For this purpose, we use the high resolution structure reported in [5] as

a starting point to describe the spectral and excitation transfer characteristics of PSI.

The structure reveals the relative orientation of chlorophyll molecules, which makes it

possible to construct an eﬀective Hamiltonian for the chlorophyll aggregate. The resulting

quantum yield for charge separation and the average excitation lifetime is determined

based on this Hamiltonian.

We also investigate the excitation transfer dynamics that results after the absorption

of a photon by PSI. Besides determining the overall lifetime of an excitation and the

quantum yield (the probability that photon absorption leads to electron transfer from

the special pair), one wishes to know how excitation migrating through PSI repeatedly

reaches and escapes the special pair, i.e., engages in sojourns from the special pair into

the chlorophyll pool. We suggest a kinetic expansion method, the sojourn expansion, to

account for the outlined excitation migration in a light-harvesting complex.

The organization of this paper is as follows: In the next section we introduce the ef-

fective Hamiltonian for the chlorophyll aggregate of PSI. Sec. 3 utilizes this Hamiltonian

to discuss candidates for the red chlorophyll states.

In Sec. 4 we discuss the eﬀect of

thermal disorder on the spectral properties of PSI in terms of random matrix theory. In

Sec. 5 we introduce the general theoretical framework for the study of excitation transfer

dynamics, including the sojourn expansion, and apply it to PSI. The robustness of the

eﬃciency of the system is investigated under the eﬀects of the ﬂuctuations in chlorophyll

site energies and the pruning of individual chlorophylls. In Sec. 6 we examine the opti-

4

mality of the arrangement of chlorophylls in PSI. Sec. 7 contains a general discussion and

our conclusions. In an appendix we summarize our method to compute inter-chlorophyll

couplings.

2 Eﬀective Hamiltonian for chlorophyll aggregate

In this section we construct an eﬀective Hamiltonian for the aggregate of chlorophyll

molecules in PSI deﬁned in a basis of single chlorophyll excitations. Isolated cyanobacte-

rial PSI is known to exist in vivo mostly as a trimer [5]. In this paper we will examine

the behavior of the monomeric complex. Of the 96 chlorophylls present in PSI, 95 are

chlorophyll a molecules and one of the special pair chlorophylls is a chlorophyll a′. For

computational simplicity, we will assume below all chlorophylls to be of chlorophyll a

type.

The lowest excited state of a chlorophyll molecule is the Qy state [23]. A set of basis

states for an eﬀective Hamiltonian is then given by

i = 1, 2, ...N,

in which the ith chlorophyll is Qy-excited, all the other chlorophylls being in their ground

Hamiltonian can be written as

greater than 7 ˚A, a range in which Coulomb interaction dominates [26]; therefore we keep

only the contribution of the direct Coulomb term, W c

ij, in the remainder of the paper.

The electronic couplings due to the direct Coulomb interaction are calculated through

two approaches. In the ﬁrst (approximate) approach, the couplings are determined as-

suming a dipole-dipole interaction between transition dipole moments of the chlorophyll

Qy states. In this approximation, the couplings are given by (see, for example, Ref. [26])

Wij = C

where di are unit vectors along transition dipole moments from the ground state to

the Qy state of the ith chlorophyll and rij is the vector connecting the Mg atoms of

chlorophylls i and j; the transition dipole moments for the Qy state are taken to be along

the vector connecting the NB and ND atoms. The latter assumption is seen to be valid by

comparing the transition dipole moment unit vectors thus computed to the ones obtained

in the course of the full Coulomb semi-empirical method introduced below. The atomic
3
cm−1
positions are taken from crystallographic data [5]. The parameter C = 116000 ˚A

in Eq. (4) is determined by enforcing asymptotic agreement at large distances with the

full Coulomb couplings introduced below [26]. Full Coulomb couplings in turn are ﬁxed
by the oscillator strength of the Qy transition, which is taken to be 23 Debye2 [27]. Since

the transition dipole moment vectors are computed simply from geometry, application of

Eq. (4) has a low computational cost. Naturally, the dipolar approximation is the more

accurate, the larger the distance between the chlorophylls.

The second approach, following Ref. [26], computes electronic couplings using a semi-

empirical Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) Hamiltonian as utilized in Refs. [26, 28].

In this

approach, the contribution of all orders of multipoles are included, i.e., not only the

dipole-dipole contribution. Therefore, we will refer to this description as the full Coulomb

(FC) approach. The details of this approach are outlined in the appendix.

In Fig. 2 are illustrated the ﬁrst ﬁve eigenstates of the eﬀective Hamiltonian (2) with

full Coulomb couplings and identical site energies. Excitons are localized typically only

over a few chlorophylls, in some cases coinciding with strongly coupled pairs.

3 Red chlorophyll candidates for photosystem I

A number of chlorophyll molecules in PSI of S. elongatus are known to absorb light at

longer wavelengths than the special pair P700. The number of these ‘red chlorophylls’

is suggested to be between seven and eleven [29, 30]. In Ref. [30] individual absorption

peaks for the red chlorophyll states were observed for 4 K at wavelengths 708 nm, 715 nm,

and 719 nm. Among possible causes for this red shift in the absorption peak of these

chlorophylls are the eﬀect of the local protein environment on the site energies and the

eﬀect of excitonic splitting due to a strong coupling between pairs of chlorophylls.

In Ref. [5] candidates for the red chlorophylls were suggested based on the orienta-

tion of chlorophylls and the assumption of a strong excitonic splitting as the cause of the

spectral red shift. In Ref. [30] a match between these candidates and the experimentally

resolved red absorption peaks were suggested. In this section we extend this discussion

by comparing the dipolar couplings with the corresponding full Coulomb couplings. In

Ref. [5] a trimer (B31-B32-B33) and three dimers (A32-B7, B37-B38, A38-A39) of chloro-

phylls were given as red chlorophyll candidates (see Fig. 3; nomenclature of Ref. [5] is

used for naming chlorophylls). Indeed in the framework of the dipolar couplings these

chlorophylls form the strongest coupled pairs. However, in the framework of the full

Coulomb couplings a diﬀerent picture emerges. This may not be surprising as the two

approaches tend to disagree over short distances, such as the inter-chlorophyll distances

within strongly coupled pairs.

In the full Coulomb description the couplings of the chlorophyll pairs in the trimer

B31-B32-B33 are signiﬁcantly (more than a factor 3) smaller than their corresponding

dipolar couplings. Since there are chlorophyll pairs with much stronger couplings in PSI,

the trimer loses its position as a red chlorophyll candidate in the full Coulomb picture.

Furthermore, a strong coupling is not enough to cause a red shift in the absorption

spectrum. Viewed as a two state system, a chlorophyll pair will have one higher energy

excitonic state and one lower energy excitonic state, each with a certain oscillator strength.

A red shift can be associated only with a case where the lower energy excitonic state has

a higher oscillator strength than the higher energy excitonic state. Otherwise, there needs

to be a signiﬁcant shift in the chlorophyll site energies due to the protein environment to

account for the red shift. It turns out that the two strongest coupled pairs, B37-B38 and

7

A38-A39, have most of their oscillator strength in the higher energy state. Therefore, we

leave them out of the list of red chlorophyll candidates.

Four pairs of chlorophylls, which have the strongest couplings as well as the higher

oscillator strength in the lower lying state, are suggested as red chlorophyll candidates

(highlighted in Table 1 and Fig. 3). A match between the observed red absorption peaks

and the suggested candidates cannot be done reliably without knowledge of the site ener-

gies. However, matching the furthest red shift with the strongest coupling we tentatively

suggest that A32-B7 is responsible for the 719 nm absorption peak, A33-A34 and A24-A35

for the 715 nm peak, and B22-B34 for the 708 nm peak.

It must be noted that excitonic splitting alone cannot be the only cause for observed red

shifts. For example, in case of two identical chlorophylls, which have their Qy absorption
peaks at 675 nm, a coupling of about 900 cm−1 would be needed to place the lower energy

excitonic state at 719 nm. This suggests that the red chlorophyll states are caused by

the contribution of both excitonic splitting and site energy shifts due to the local protein

environment. Furthermore, any isolated chlorophyll may contribute to the red chlorophyll

band of the PSI spectrum solely due to its site energy shift, a possibility which is totally

neglected in our present picture.

The trimer of chlorophylls, B31-B32-B33, deserves a closer inspection than presented

thus far. As seen in Fig. 4, the atomic structure indicates that the three chlorophylls

are connected to each other by water molecules, suggesting that they might have to

be treated computationally as a supermolecule. In regard to the possible failure of our

description, we note that the His residue coordinating chlorophylls B31-B32-B33 is absent

in Synechocystis, which exhibits a weaker long wavelength absorption band. Indeed, the

close packing of chlorophylls B31-B32-B33 is reminiscent of J-aggregates [31], which are

known to have red shifted spectra compared to the spectra of their building blocks. We

may suggest, hence, that the chlorophylls B31-B32-B33 may yet be responsible for red

absorption, despite the weak couplings emerging from our description.

4 Eﬀect of thermal disorder on spectral properties

Spectral properties and excitation transfer dynamics of a photosynthetic system are two

complementary sources of information. Both are determined by the Hamiltonian describ-

8

ing the system. However, the spectral properties are inﬂuenced more by chlorophyll site

energies, i.e., the diagonal entries of the eﬀective Hamiltonian, whereas the excitation

transfer dynamics more directly reﬂects the role of inter-chlorophyll couplings.

A reconstruction of the (low temperature) absorption spectrum from the Hamiltonian

is not possible without a knowledge of the site energies. This is seen, for example, in the

much smaller seven chlorophyll system of the FMO complex [32]. Similarly the inverse

problem of using the spectrum to reconstruct the site energies (assuming the couplings

are known) is ill posed, since with as many parameters as the number of chlorophylls

in the system one cannot unambiguously assign the site energies.

Indeed it is a very

important test for any calculation of the chlorophyll site energies to faithfully reproduce

the experimentally observed absorption spectrum, especially at low temperatures.

Nevertheless spectral data can provide valuable information on the general distribution

of chlorophyll site energies if not on individual sites. Therefore, we study the spectral

properties of PSI in the light of the eﬀective Hamiltonian introduced in Sec. 2, before we

proceed with a detailed discussion of excitation transfer dynamics.

4.1 Random matrix theory as a description of thermal disorder

Both the spectral features and the excitation transfer dynamics in a photosynthetic sys-

tem need to be described in the presence of strong thermal disorder. Standard zero-

temperature quantum theory remains inadequate in this respect. Below we present a

method, based on random matrix theory [33, 34, 35], to study static disorder in a system

described by an eﬀective Hamiltonian, such as the one given in Sec. 2. For a more detailed

account of the application of random matrix theory to the description of static disorder

in photosynthetic systems the reader is referred to Ref. [36]. For a discussion of dynamic

disorder in a light-harvesting complex the reader is referred to Refs. [37, 38].

We consider an ensemble of Hamiltonians that describes a set of photosynthetic sys-

tems in thermal equilibrium.

In contrast to a canonical ensemble from statistical me-

chanics, whose members are points in the phase space of one Hamiltonian, we consider

an ensemble of Hamiltonians each of which represents another copy of the photosynthetic

system in question. We will be interested in spectral properties as averaged over this

ensemble.

9

(5)

(6)

(7)

For a description of this ensemble, we employ the sum of the noise-free eﬀective Hamil-

tonian, H0, based on the crystal structure, and a random part, R, representing thermal

ﬂuctuations

deﬁned by

H = H0 + R.

Here the matrix R is drawn from a certain probability distribution, P (R), representing

the eﬀects of thermal disorder. All relevant spectral quantities are deﬁned in terms of an

ensemble average over the random part, R, with respect to the weight function, P (R).

dipole moment unit vectors of individual sites, dm, and the expansion coeﬃcients, ci(m),

P

of eigenstates.

These deﬁnitions for the average spectral behavior are superior to the ‘Gaussians on

sticks’ approach sometimes utilized, where Gaussian envelopes are put around the eigen-

values of H0 to reconstruct the spectrum. Especially in cases where there is a signiﬁcant

overlap between the envelopes of multiple eigenvalues, the average spectral properties are

seen to deviate signiﬁcantly. As an extreme example one can consider a case of N degen-

erate eigenvalues [34]. In this case a sum of Gaussian envelopes gives another Gaussian

with the same width, whereas the width of the average spectrum should be proportional

to √N.

The nature of the probability distribution, P (R), as a function of temperature is not

easy to determine. However, studies in random matrix theory have shown that many

average spectral features are largely independent of the exact shape of P (R) and instead

depend mainly on its width [35]. This kind of independence from the speciﬁc probability

distribution is akin to the central limit theorem and is known as random matrix univer-

10

sality. This universality allows one to make simplifying assumptions on the nature of

P (R) [35].

Although most results on random matrix universality are based on the limit where the

matrix size becomes large, remarkable spectral similarity persists even for mesoscopically

sized ensembles. In an earlier investigation, we have applied random matrix universality

to the peripheral light-harvesting complex, LH2, of purple bacteria [36], which has 16

strongly coupled bacteriochlorophylls. It was seen that, when the width of the disorder

term, P (R), is taken into account the average density of states and the absorption spec-

trum are rather insensitive to the changes of P (R). Analytical formulae for the density of

states at ﬁnite temperature as a function of the zero temperature spectrum were derived

for a simple form of P (R) in Ref. [36].

In the following we take the probability distribution, P (R), to describe diagonal dis-

order

For the width of the distribution (8) we take νdiag = 70 cm−1 at 4 K [39, 40]. A similar

description has been used in Ref. [10] for the light harvesting system of purple bacteria. We

use the parameter νdiag to numerically evaluate the absorption spectrum as deﬁned in (7).

In Fig. 5 is shown the absorption spectrum at 4 K based on the eﬀective Hamiltonian

with full Coulomb couplings and homogeneous site energies corresponding to 675 nm.
Ignoring the red chlorophyll band of the spectrum, a width for the bulk of about 230 cm−1
(corresponding to a FWHM of 550 cm−1) at 4 K is reported in Ref. [30]. However, the
width for the 4 K spectrum in Fig. 5 measures only about 140 cm−1. The mismatch can

be attributed to our neglect of the site energy heterogeneity.

Though it is not possible to reconstruct the chlorophyll site energies from the spec-

trum, one can obtain an estimate on the width of the distribution of site energies. In

order to accomplish this we will ignore for the moment the red chlorophyll band of the

spectrum and instead concentrate on the main peak as given in Ref. [30]. The width of

the absorption spectrum for the actual (inhomogeneous) site energies, Winhom, the width

of the absorption spectrum for the homogeneous site energies, Whom, and the width of the

distribution of site energies (heterogeneity), Wǫ, are approximately related to each other

11

(9)

As discussed above, assuming Winhom = 230 cm−1 and Whom = 140 cm−1 results in a site
energy distribution width of about Wǫ = 180 cm−1 (FWHM of 430 cm−1). The validity

of this assertion can be numerically veriﬁed by generating an ensemble of Hamiltonians

with the same full Coulomb couplings but with random site energies for the given value

of Wǫ. This value will be utilized later in the discussion of excitation transfer dynamics.

5 Excitation transfer dynamics in photosystem I

In this section we construct the excitation transfer rates between chlorophylls using

F¨orster theory [24]. We will follow the methodology suggested in Ref. [41]. The exci-

tation transfer rate from chlorophyll i to chlorophyll j is [24, 25]

where Ei and Ej are the absorption peaks for the chlorophylls and S is the Stokes shift.
We take the Stokes shift to be equal to 160 cm−1 at room temperature [23] and 20 cm−1

at 4 K [43]. We have assumed identical widths for the emission and absorption spectra
of 240 cm−1 at room temperature [23].

In the case of identical site energies, rates for

forward transfer and back transfer are equal, Tij = Tji, but this is not the case when

the site energies diﬀer. The network of excitation transfer rates between chlorophylls of

PSI for identical site energies are shown in Fig. 6 for both the full Coulomb and dipolar

Hamiltonians.

12

The largest transfer rate away from a given chlorophyll suggests the average excitation

lifetime at that chlorophyll. Fig. 7 shows the largest excitation transfer rates for all 96

chlorophylls. It can be seen that these rates correspond to an average largest transfer rate
between chlorophylls of about 11 ps−1.

Using the transfer rates between the chlorophylls, a master equation can be constructed

for the rate of change of probabilities, pi(t), describing the likelihood that the chlorophyll

i is electronically excited at time t. The corresponding rate equation is

pair and zero otherwise. The dissipation and charge separation rates are not known to

great accuracy. Inspired by the purple bacterial light-harvesting systems [41] we assume
a dissipation rate of kdiss = (1 ns)−1. The charge separation rate at P700 is observed to
be between 1 ps−1 and (3 ps)−1 [44, 45, 46]. In the following we will assume a charge
separation rate of kCS = (1.5 ps)−1.

Average excitation lifetimes and the quantum yields for various models are provided

P

in Table 2. The data in the ﬁrst three rows are based on an eﬀective Hamiltonian that

assumes identical site energies for the two chlorophylls of the P700 pair. The site energies

were chosen such that the P700 excitonic state with the highest oscillator strength coin-
cides with the 698 nm (14327 cm−1) absorption peak at 4 K. Since one of the two P700

chlorophylls is a chlorophyll a′, the identical site energy assumption for the P700 is likely

to be unrealistic, however it shall be adequate for an approximate description of the exci-

tation transfer dynamics. For full Coulomb couplings the highest oscillator strength lies

at the higher energy excitonic state (see Table 1); since the respective coupling between
the two P700 chlorophylls is 47.6 cm−1, the P700 site energy is chosen to be 14279 cm−1.

For dipolar couplings the highest oscillator strength lies at the lower energy excitonic

state (the sign of the coupling is diﬀerent for the two methods); the coupling between
the two P700 chlorophylls is 272 cm−1 requiring a P700 site energy of 14599 cm−1. The
site energies for the remaining chlorophylls are placed at 675 nm (14815 cm−1) unless

otherwise noted.

The eﬃciency of 97.3 % and the average excitation lifetime of 27.4 ps for full Coulomb

couplings, given in the ﬁrst row of Table 2, are in general agreement with the near unit

eﬃciency and the 20-40 ps lifetime reported for PSI at room temperature [2, 47, 48, 49,

50, 51]. A recent estimate of the average excitation lifetime reported for trimeric PSI in

S. elongatus is 35.8 ps [47]. A comparison between the ﬁrst and the last rows in Table 1

shows the importance of having P700 chlorophylls at a lower energy than the bulk of the

chlorophylls in order to decrease the trapping time and to increase eﬃciency.

In Fig. 8 are provided the distribution of quantum yield and average excitation lifetime

across an ensemble of Hamiltonians with full Coulomb couplings, P700 tuned to the

observed absorption peak, and all other chlorophyll site energies randomly distributed
with a width of 180 cm−1 around 675 nm (thus the ensemble covers diﬀerent realizations of

heterogeneity, not static disorder). Fig. 8 reveals that, at room temperature, ﬂuctuations

in the site energies (heterogeneity) have no considerable eﬀect on eﬃciency. This allows us

to reconstruct room temperature excitation transfer dynamics with reasonable accuracy

14

even without detailed knowledge of the chlorophyll site energies. However, at 4 K, the line

shapes of individual chlorophylls become so narrow that the spectral overlap integrals in

Eq. (10) become unrealistically small for misplaced site energies. Also at low temperatures

the broadening of spectral line shapes due to electron-phonon couplings [30] need to

be taken into account as this broadening is likely to eﬀect the overlap integrals in the

context of F¨orster theory. We ﬁnd it impossible to construct a reliable picture of the low

temperature excitation transfer dynamics with the current data.

It is of interest to know in how far low energy chlorophylls control the excitation trans-

fer dynamics and trapping in PSI. In this regard, one may construct models in which the

red chlorophyll candidates given in Sec. 3 are used to reﬁne the assignment of chloro-

phyll site energies. However, it must be kept in mind that an accurate assignment of an

individual chlorophyll pair to an observed red chlorophyll state cannot be done reliably

without a precise knowledge of site energies. It is seen that the room temperature excita-

tion transfer dynamics is not eﬀected greatly by the inclusion of this extra information in

a model where all other site energies are unknown or taken to be random. Fig. 8 supports

this claim. As a result we ﬁnd it rather unfruitful to proliferate the multitude of models

already given in Table 2. At room temperature the role of low energy chlorophylls appear

to be simply to extend the absorption proﬁle to longer wavelengths rather than to have

a profound eﬀect on the excitation transfer dynamics. However, at low temperatures red

chlorophylls may function as eﬀective traps and could serve as probes to investigate the

excitation transfer dynamics of PSI in detail.

5.1 Eﬀect of removal of individual chlorophylls on excitation

transfer dynamics

One way to probe the function of individual chlorophylls in PSI as well as the degree

of robustness in its design is to examine the eﬀect of the removal of chlorophylls on the

eﬃciency of the system. To this end we remove various chlorophylls one at a time and

examine the quantum yield of the remaining system.

Fig. 9 shows the quantum yield as a function of the removed chlorophyll. The two

P700 chlorophylls are not removed in this study. Although the eﬀect of the removal of the

other four reaction center chlorophylls on the quantum yield are shown, it is hard to test

15

their eﬀect directly, since they are also a part of the electron transfer chain. Therefore,

we will concentrate on the remaining 90 chlorophylls.

It is interesting to note that, except for the four reaction center chlorophylls which are

immediate neighbors to the P700, removal of a chlorophyll hardly has any eﬀect on the

quantum yield. In fact, for most of the chlorophylls a deletion results in an increase in

the quantum yield. This is a consequence of the relative yield being deﬁned with respect

to the remaining chlorophylls, not with respect to the unperturbed system.

Thus it is seen that, outside the reaction center, no chlorophylls play the role of a

gatekeeper for excitation transfer, whose removal would have an adverse eﬀect on the

yield.

Instead the individual chlorophylls contribute to the overall cross-section of the

antenna complex. Outside the electron transfer chain, the four chlorophylls with the

highest impact on eﬃciency (A26, B24, B39 and A40) are the nearest neighbors of the

six reaction center chlorophylls. These chlorophylls, especially A40 and B39, appear to

link the antenna system to the reaction center and are therefore referred to as connecting

chlorophylls. As an extreme example one may consider the removal of all four of these

chlorophylls simultaneously. Even in this case the quantum yield reduces to only 96.85 %

from the value of 97.25 % for the unperturbed complex with the same Hamiltonian; the

average excitation lifetime increases from 27.4 ps to 31.5 ps upon removal. These results

agree with some of the simulations reported in Ref. [52].

5.2 An expansion of the average lifetime in terms of return

times to the reaction center

The average excitation lifetime, τ , can be expanded in terms of processes describing the

initial delivery of excitation to the special pair and possible subsequent returns following

detrapping. In order to establish such an expansion, we rewrite the excitation transfer

rates (12) in a form where the P700 is treated as a single excitonically coupled unit as

opposed to two separate chlorophylls.

A two state Hamiltonian for P700 is given by

HP 700 =

(18)

where ǫ1 and ǫ2 are the site energies for the two P700 chlorophylls and UP 700 denotes the

coupling between them. Not knowing the values of the site energies it will be assumed

16

below that ǫ1 = ǫ2. However, the expansion below can be readily applied to nonidentical

site energies.

We will assume that thermal equilibration between eigenstates of P700 have been

achieved before excitation transfer out of P700 occurs. This is likely to be a reasonable
assumption at room temperature for full Coulomb couplings, where kBT = 209 cm−1

is larger than the interchlorophyll couplings. The expansion outlined below can also be

formulated for a reaction center where multiple chlorophylls without a strong excitonic

character are responsible for charge separation, making the thermal equilibration assump-

tion invalid. However, in that case the ﬁnal formulation of the expansion cannot be written

as succinctly as Eq. (31) below.

Terms arising in the sojourn expansion for an eﬀective Hamiltonian with full Coulomb

couplings (see row 1 of Table 2) is provided in Table 3. It can be seen that the time for a

ﬁrst delivery of excitation to P700, approximately given by τ0, constitutes less than half

of the average excitation lifetime at room temperature.

6 How optimal is the design of photosystem I?

At ﬁrst glance the arrangement of chlorophylls in PSI appear to be random except for

a pseudo-C2 symmetry (see Fig. 1). Especially when compared to the regular circular

aggregates found in purple bacterial photosynthetic systems, this brings up the question

of whether the particular arrangement of chlorophylls in PSI is optimal in some way.

Even though the ﬁtness landscape over which a photosynthetic apparatus should be

judged is many dimensional, a crude measure of optimality is given by the quantum yield

of the system. Ignoring all other concerns for optimality from an evolutionary perspective

such as assembly, aggregation and interaction with other biomolecules in the cell, we

examine whether the chlorophyll aggregate in PSI can be rearranged to result in a better

quantum yield.

In order to keep the number of parameters to be varied at a manageable level, the

chlorophyll positions (as deﬁned by their Mg atoms) as well as the chlorophyll site energies

are kept ﬁxed.

Instead we consider an ensemble of alternate PSI’s formed by random

independent reorientations of constituent chlorophylls.

It is costly to repeat the semi-empirical computation of full Coulomb couplings between

chlorophylls for a large ensemble of chlorophyll arrangements. Therefore, we revert to

dipolar couplings for this study. The ensemble in question is formed by taking the vector

for the transition dipole moment at each chlorophyll and multiplying it by a randomly

generated SO(3) rotation matrix, thus reorienting it. A new eﬀective Hamiltonian is

then computed using the couplings between these new transition dipole moment vectors

as explained in Sec. 2, while keeping the same site energies as before. The eﬀective

Hamiltonians thus generated are used to compute the quantum yield and the average

excitation lifetime at room temperature. For this study identical site energies (675 nm)

for all chlorophylls are chosen except for P700, the site energies of which are chosen in

such a way as to coincide with the observed absorption peak, as explained in Sec. 5.

20

Therefore the results of this study should be compared with the original arrangement of

chlorophylls given in row 2 of Table 2.

Fig. 11 contains a histogram of quantum yields and average excitation lifetimes for this

ensemble at room temperature. The values for the original arrangement of chlorophylls

are indicated by an arrow. It is seen that the original chlorophyll arrangement is nearly

at the top of the distribution, though a few arrangements can be found to have a better

quantum yield. It does not necessarily imply, however, that the eﬃciency of PSI can be

easily improved upon. Not only is the study of quantum yields outlined above approximate

in nature, but also there is no way to accurately model the constraints which had to be

satisﬁed over the course of the evolution of this system. Nevertheless, it is impressive to

ﬁnd the original chlorophyll arrangement at near top eﬃciency.

The relatively small variation in the quantum yield across the ensemble seen in Fig. 11

brings up the question as to whether the apparent optimality is an artifact that will

disappear in a more accurate computation. This small variation is a result of the nearly

three orders of magnitude diﬀerence between the dissipation and charge transfer rates.

As an ultimate test, full Coulomb couplings need to be computed for each system in an

ensemble of randomly oriented chlorophyll aggregates and the eﬀect of individual site

energies also need to be taken into account. This is beyond the scope of this study

due to prohibitively high computational costs. Nevertheless, as a consistency check, the

ensemble described in Fig. 11 may be replaced by one with an alternate (random) set of

site energies. It is seen that at room temperature the result of near optimal eﬃciency

changes little under an assumption of diﬀerent site energies (not shown). This is because

the transfer rates at room temperature are inﬂuenced more strongly by couplings than

by site energies, unless site energy variations are large enough to be comparable to the

spectral width of individual chlorophylls (see Eq. 10). Also, the similarity between the

networks of excitation transfer pathways for dipolar and full Coulomb couplings seen in

Fig. 6 seems to suggest that the general properties of excitation transfer dynamics and

therefore also the optimality will not be greatly eﬀected by going from the dipolar to the

full Coulomb couplings.

21

7 Conclusion

The availability of a high resolution structure of the cyanobacterial photosystem I provides

new opportunities to investigate the mechanism of light harvesting in this large pigment-

protein complex.

In this study, the excitation transfer dynamics at room temperature

has been examined starting from an eﬀective Hamiltonian based on interactions between

chlorophylls.

As a ﬁrst approximation the eﬀect of chlorophyll-protein interactions on the site en-

ergies has been ignored. However, we have used the available spectral data to construct

a more reﬁned Hamiltonian with limited information on site energies. Also, a prediction

on the overall heterogeneity of site energies is made.

The calculated quantum yield and average excitation lifetime at room temperature

compare favorably with experimental results. The sojourn expansion method resolves

details of excitation migration in PSI, namely repeated approaches to and escapes from

the reaction center. Studying an ensemble of Hamiltonians corresponding to copies of

PSI with varying site energies, it is seen that the yield and the lifetime are inﬂuenced

largely by inter-chlorophyll couplings and not so much by ﬂuctuations of the site energies

at room temperature. The sojourn expansion reveals that the time for a ﬁrst delivery of

excitation to P700 contributes less than half of the average excitation lifetime. At room

temperature, about two thirds of the lifetime results from detrapping events.

However, the low temperature behavior of PSI is more diﬃcult to describe accu-

rately than the room temperature behaviour. Not only is the low temperature absorption

spectrum impossible to reproduce without a knowledge of chlorophyll site energies, but

also overlap integrals contributing to the excitation transfer rates become much more

sensitive to the diﬀerence between the donor and the acceptor site energies due to the

smaller linewidths at low temperatures. Furthermore, the broadening of lineshapes due to

electron-phonon couplings also need to be carefully taken into account at low temperatures

as this eﬀect may have a signiﬁcant impact on the overlap integrals in the framework of

F¨orster theory. Ignoring these contributions results in an unrealistic picture of excitation

transfer dynamics at low temperature.

The robustness and optimality of the chlorophyll arrangement in PSI has been exam-

ined by means of various computational experiments. On the one hand, it is seen that

22

the eﬃciency of the chlorophyll network of PSI is robust against perturbations such as

the pruning of individual chlorophylls or ﬂuctuations of chlorophyll site energies. On the

other hand, a study of an ensemble of alternate PSI’s with randomly reoriented chloro-

phyll aggregates shows that the original arrangement actually has a near optimal quantum

yield.

Note added in revision

After submission of this paper we have been informed of a recent calculation of chlorophyll

site energies for cyanobacterial PSI [59]. When these site energy values are substituted

in the computations outlined above we obtain at room temperature an average excitation

lifetime of 33.9 ps and a quantum yield of 96.6 %, which compare favorably with the results

given in this paper. The overall width of the distribution of site energies, including the
red chlorophylls and P700, is around 260 cm−1, which is larger than the estimate made
in this paper of 180 cm−1 based on the bulk of the low temperature spectrum. These new

results support our suggestion that the room temperature excitation transfer dynamics

of PSI can be described well without detailed knowledge of site energies. Repeating the

optimality study discussed in section 6 also for the set of site energies in Ref. [59] yields

results similar to those shown in Fig. 11.

Assuming the same values of the semiempirical parameters as in Ref. [26] (listed in Ta-

ble 4), we perform a SCF-CI calculation, including all single excited π-orbitals, for the

singlet states of a chlorophyll.

The chlorophyll electronic structure calculations are based on geometries of a simpliﬁed

chlorophyll analog, displayed in Fig. 12 (solid line). In this analog, the double bond of ring

II (dotted line in Fig. 12) is taken out. Thus the chlorophyll is almost symmetric about

the magnesium atom except that there is a carbon atom at one end and an oxygen atom

at the opposite end. For the calculations performed on the analog structure, the Qx and

Qy states are easy to identify. However, for the calculations based on the real chlorophyll

structure, where the electronic states are mixed, this identiﬁcation is diﬃcult. A fully

symmetric analog, with both oxygen atoms at the end, was also proposed in [28] based on

the same consideration and the error arising from the simpliﬁed chlorophyll analog was

shown to be insigniﬁcant compared to the systematic errors.

Figure 1: Photosystem I of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus and its 96 chloro-
phylls. The special pair P700 is shown in blue. The remaining four reaction center
chlorophylls are shown in red. For clarity, neither the chlorophyll tails nor other cofactors
are shown. The chlorophyll pool surrounding the reaction center displays a pseudo-C2
symmetry. Figure produced with VMD [22].

30

Figure 2: Excitonic (de)localization in PSI. The ﬁrst ﬁve eigenstates of the eﬀective
Hamiltonian with full Coulomb couplings and identical site energies are shown. The radius
of the sphere around a chlorophyll is proportional to its occupation probability in the
respective state. Excitons are delocalized typically over no more than a few chlorophylls.
Figure produced with VMD [22].

31

Figure 3: Red chlorophyll candidates. Chlorophylls suggested to be engaged in red
absorption are highlighted in red. Red chlorophyll candidates are chosen to be the four
chlorophyll pairs, which exhibit the strongest couplings in the full Coulomb description as
well as a higher oscillator strength in the lower lying excitonic state. In yellow are shown
chlorophyll pairs with strong couplings in the dipolar approximation that are suggested
to be not responsible for the red absorption in the full Coulomb description (see also text,
Table 1 and Fig. 4). Figure produced with VMD [22].

32

Figure 4: Chlorophyll trimer B31-B32-B33. Shown are these three closely spaced chloro-
phylls connected by two water molecules and coordinated by a His residue. The structure
suggests that the trimer be described as a supermolecule. Figure produced with VMD [22].

33

Figure 5: Absorption spectrum. Shown is the low temperature (4 K) spectrum for
an eﬀective Hamiltonian with full Coulomb couplings and homogeneous site energies
(675 nm). The spectrum is generated for an ensemble with diagonal disorder correspond-
ing to 70 cm−1. A comparison of the width of this spectrum with that of the experimental
absorption spectrum [30] allows the prediction of the heterogeneity in the site energies.

34

Figure 6: Network of excitation transfer pathways in PSI. The networks at room tem-
perature for full Coulomb couplings (top) and dipolar couplings (bottom) are shown. The
thickness of bonds connecting chlorophylls are proportional to the transfer rates between
them. Only the 130 largest transfer rates are presented. The transfer rates are computed
for a system with identical site energies at room temperature. Figure produced with
VMD [22].

35

Figure 7: Largest excitation transfer rate from PSI chlorophylls. Shown are rates for all
96 PS1 chlorophylls as a function of the donor chlorophyll. The horizontal line indicates
the average value of 11.1 ps−1. The excitation transfer rates are computed for a Hamil-
tonian with full Coulomb couplings and homogeneous site energies for all chlorophylls,
except P700 (c.f. row 1, Table 2).

36

Figure 8: Eﬀect of ﬂuctuations of the site energies (heterogeneity) on excitation transfer
dynamics. Shown are the distributions of quantum yield and lifetime at room temperature
for an ensemble of eﬀective Hamiltonians with full Coulomb couplings. The ensemble
consists of systems where P700 was tuned to the observed absorption peak and with the
rest of the chlorophyll site energies chosen randomly with a width of 180 cm−1 around
675 nm. The histograms were generated from an ensemble of 1000 systems.

37

Figure 9: Quantum yield for pruned chlorophylls. Shown is the quantum yield resulting
after pruning of individual chlorophylls. The chlorophylls whose deletion has the highest
impact on quantum yield are labeled. Chlorophylls (eC-xx), numbered 3 to 6, are part
of the reaction center. Chlorophylls A26, A40, B24, and B39 are connecting chlorophylls
situated closest to the reaction center (see inset). The horizontal line denotes the eﬃciency
of the unperturbed system (97.25 %), which is described by the eﬀective Hamiltonian with
full Coulomb couplings, identical site energies, and P700 tuned to the observed absorption
spectrum (c.f. row 1, Table 2).

Figure 10: Processes contributing to the overall excitation lifetime. The excitation in
either causes
a uniform initial state
a charge separation (CS) or, with detrapping probability q1, returns to the surrounding
(see text). From the transient state excita-
chlorophylls through the transient state
after which charge separation occurs or,
tion migrates through PSI to return to
again with detrapping probability, qT , the transient state
is reached once more. The
process of migration, return to
, possibly charge separation or renewed detrapping
i
is repeated. The ﬁrst usage time, τ0, is the sum of the delivery-to-trap time starting from
and of the charge separation time. τ0 represents the average time it
a uniform state,
takes for charge separation to take place if no detrapping events occur. The sojourn time,
τsoj, is the sum of the delivery-to-trap time starting from the transient state,
and of
the charge separation time. After subtracting the charge separation time, τsoj may be
viewed as the return time back to P700 after a detrapping event. Dissipation processes
are not shown.

Figure 11: Optimality of PSI. The distributions of quantum yield and average excitation
lifetime for an ensemble of randomly generated chlorophyll aggregates at room temper-
ature are shown. Chlorophyll couplings are computed in the dipolar approximation to
reduce computational cost. P700 site energies are tuned to the observed absorption peak
and the remaining site energies are taken to be identical (675 nm). The histograms are
generated from an ensemble of 1000 systems. The results for the original arrangement
(c.f. row 2, Table 2) of chlorophylls are indicated by an arrow.

Table 1: Key chlorophyll pairs in PSI and their couplings. Pairs shown in boldface are
the suggested red chlorophyll candidates according to the excitonic splittings computed in
the full Coulomb picture (see text for details). FC: full Coulomb couplings, DP: dipolar
couplings, Olo/Ohi: ratio of oscillator strengths for the lower and higher excitonic states for
full Coulomb couplings. The couplings are given in units of cm−1. The pair ecA1-ecB1
is the special pair P700. Note that the dipolar approximation generally overestimates
the value of the coupling at short distances. The parentheses around the full Coulomb
couplings for the special pair and the trimer B31-B32-B33 indicate that these chlorophyll
groups might have to be treated as supermolecules, making the full Coulomb description
inaccurate (see text and Fig. 4).

plings with P700 tuned (see text) to the observed absorption peak and with identical
site energies (675 nm) for the chlorophyll pool. Model B: Dipole-dipole couplings with
P700 tuned to the observed absorption peak and with identical site energies (675 nm)
for the chlorophyll pool. (The diﬀerence in lifetimes for models A and B are mainly due
to the diﬀerence of site energy assignments for P700 for dipolar and full Coulomb mod-
els.) Model C: Full Coulomb couplings with P700 tuned to the observed absorption peak,
but with random site energies (centered around 675 nm with a width of 180 cm−1) for
the chlorophyll pool. (Ensemble average value is given here. For more detail see Fig. 8.)
Model D: Full Coulomb couplings with identical site energies (675 nm) for all chlorophylls,
including P700.

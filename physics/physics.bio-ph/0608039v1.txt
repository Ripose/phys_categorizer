Abstract

We develop a small–deformation theory for the dynamics of a quasi–spherical vesicle in viscous

ﬂows. The analysis takes into account the membrane incompressibility and includes the viscosity

contrast between the inner and suspending ﬂuids and the membrane bending stresses. The leading

order shape evolution equation is derived. The analytical results show that the stationary vesicle

shape and orientation angle with respect to the ﬂow are independent of the membrane bending

rigidity. Non-Newtonian rheology with both shear thinning viscosity and normal stresses is pre-

dicted for a dilute suspension of vesicles.

In the tumbling regime, the vesicle exhibits periodic

shape deformations with a frequency that increases with the viscosity contrast. The theory is in

good agreement with published experimental data for vesicle behavior in simple shear ﬂow.

INTRODUCTION

Dynamics of deformable particles such as drops, capsules and cells in ﬂow represents

a long–standing problem of interest because of its relevance to rheology of emulsions and

biological suspensions such as blood. The problem is challenging because the shape of these

“soft” particles is not given a priori but is governed by the balance between interfacial forces,

e.g. due to stretching and/or bending of the interface, and ﬂuid stresses. The interfacial

properties, therefore, play a crucial role in the dynamics of these particles.

Microhydrodynamics of drops and capsules has been studied extensively1,2,3. The drop

interface is governed by tension, which in the absence of surfactants is isotropic; surfactants

can give rise non–uniform tension and shear and dilatational viscous stresses. Capsule

membranes are made of polymeric materials, which, in addition to the above mentioned

stresses, can generate interfacial stresses of a more complicated nature, e.g. neo–Hookean.

Typically, drops and capsules have no bending resistance and their interface is compressible,

i.e the total area can vary when subjected to an external ﬂow. For example, a drop in shear

ﬂow deforms into an ellipsoid. As the ﬂow strength increases, the drop area also increases

and the angle between the ellipsoid major axis and ﬂow direction decreases from π/4. If

ﬂow strength is suﬃciently high the drop breaks up.

Vesicles formed by a closed lipid bilayer membrane are widely employed as a cell

paradigm4. The nature of the bilayer introduces two new features in the problem: bending

rigidity and membrane incompressibility. Equilibrium mechanical properties of vesicles made

of artiﬁcial membranes are fairly well understood5. Vesicles exhibit a variety of equilibrium

shapes that correspond to minima of the membrane bending energy for a given volume-to-

area ratio5. Experimental studies6,7,8,9 of vesicle behavior in unbounded shear ﬂow observe

that in weak ﬂows and when the inner and outer ﬂuids are the same the vesicle deforms into

a tank-treading stationary prolate ellipsoid with inclination angle with respect to the ﬂow

direction close to π/4; however, in striking contrast to drops, when the ﬂuid inside is more

viscous that the outside the vesicle undergoes a tumbling motion.

Numerical simulations10,11,12 and analytical theories13,14,15 of vesicle microhydrodynamics

that attempt to elucidate the experimental observations are limited. In their classic paper

Keller and Skalak16 analyzed the motion of a tank–treading ellipsoid in shear ﬂow. The

theory qualitatively captures features like the tumbling transition but the assumptions of

2

a ﬁxed particle shape questions the model applicability to deformable vesicles. The free-

boundary character of the problem is taken into account in several recent works. Shape

evolution of a ﬂuctuating quasi–spherical vesicle was considered by Seifert13 for the case

when the inner and suspending ﬂuids are the same, i.e. there is no viscosity contrast. The

theory predicts a stationary, tank–treading prolate ellipsoid and no transition to tumbling

motion. The importance of viscosity contrast for the tumbling transition was recognized by

Misbah14, who showed quantitatively that the critical value of viscosity contrast decreases

with the volume-to-surface ratio. He also pointed out that the area constraint leads to non-

linear leading order evolution equations for the vesicle shape, which in the case when only

ellipsoidal deformation modes are considered are independent of the membrane bending

rigidity. Similar results were derived by Olla15 whose analysis was based on a diﬀerent

approach to describe membrane stresses that considers a membrane of non–zero thickness.

Another interesting aspect of the vesicle microhydrodynamics is the vesicle behavior near

a wall. Flow–induced deformation of an adhering vesicle gives rise to a lift force that can lead

to unbinding from the substrate17,18,19. The experiments have not been yet quanitatively

compared to theoretical studies20,21,22.

The purpose of this paper is to include the eﬀects of viscosity contrast and membrane

bending rigidity in the analysis of vesicle dynamics in shear ﬂows and to provide a quantita-

tive description of the experimentally observed vesicle behavior. As a ﬁrst step, the leading

order small deformation of a quasi–spherical vesicle will be considered. However, the devel-

oped formalism will serve as a rigorous basis for considering higher orders in the non–linear

dynamics of a vesicle in ﬂow.

II. PROBLEM FORMULATION

Let us consider a neutrally–buoyant vesicle suspended in an incompressible ﬂuid of vis-

cosity η. The vesicle is ﬁlled with an incompressible ﬂuid of viscosity (λ

1) η bound by an

−

inextensible membrane of zero thickness characterized by ﬁxed area A and bending rigidity

modulus κ. The vesicle has a characteristic size a deﬁned by the radius of a sphere of the

same volume. The equilibrium shape of the vesicle is characterized by a small excess area

A. Governing equations

The vesicle is placed in a steady two-dimensional linear ﬂow

where ˙γ is the strain rate, and E is the velocity gradient. Linear ﬂows are deﬁned by

Irrotational ﬂows such as

Typically vesicles are micron-sized. At these length-scales water is eﬀectively very viscous,

Since the number of lipids in the membrane and the area per lipid are ﬁxed, the total

vesicle area is constant and the membrane behaves as an incompressible material, i.e. a

membrane element only deforms but does not change its area. The local area conservation

DA/Dt = 0 implies that the velocity ﬁeld at the interface is irrotational13

v = 0

(8)

Accordingly, the local tension σ changes in order to keep the local area constant. The

membrane incompressibility is analogous to the ﬂuid incompressibility, where ﬁnite changes

in pressure correspond to inﬁnitesimal changes in ﬂuid density, and pressure takes the place

of the density as an independent ﬁeld variable.

In that respect, parallels can be drawn

between vesicles and spherical drops covered with an incompressible surfactant ﬁlm23.

B. Dimensionless parameters

In the case of drops, deformation is inhibited by strong surface tension or when the

internal ﬂuid is more viscous than the outer ﬂuid and the vorticity is non–zero2. Similar

conclusions can be drawn for vesicles.

ing stresses work to bring the shape back to its preferred curvature state; the corresponding

time scale is

In shear ﬂow, vesicle rotation away from the extensional axis of the imposed ﬂow eﬀectively

decreases the extent of shape distortion; the associated time scale is

The strength of these two relaxation mechanisms that limit shape deformation by the ﬂow

(13)

The smaller of these parameters controls the magnitude of vesicle deformation. At moderate

viscosity ratios, the vesicle shape remains close to the equilibrium one provided that the

capillary number is small, i.e. the ﬂow is weak. High viscosity inner ﬂuid limits the shape

distortion by means of increasing the rate of vesicle rotation. In addition to the ﬂow–related

parameters, a physical parameter that arises from vesicle geometry is the excess area (1)

which sets the maximum magnitude of the shape distortion.

Henceforth, bending stresses and tension are normalized by κ/a2; all other quantities are

rescaled using η, a, and ˙γ. Accordingly, the time scale is ˙γ−1, the velocity scale is ˙γa, bulk

stresses are scaled with η ˙γ.

outline of the method, and focus on the new features speciﬁc to membranes such as the area

constraint and tension.

The area constraint couples all modes thereby making the leading order vesicle dynamics

dynamics is that the stationary solution is independent of the membrane properties (even

stiﬀness).

IV. RESULTS: SIMPLE SHEAR FLOW

The extensional part of external ﬂow (2), which is responsible for shape distortion, is fully

characterized by a second-order traceless tensor, which corresponds to spherical harmonics

of the order j = 2 (25a). Therefore, at leading order the shear ﬂow aﬀects only the subspace

j = 2. Considering only these modes simpliﬁes the expression for the tension (D5) and the

evolution equations (24) to the following set of coupled non–linear diﬀerential equations

The numerical solution of the full set of evolution equations (24) shows that all other modes

expanding for small values of the excess area ∆ we obtain

which agrees with the expression reported by Seifert13 for the no viscosity contrast case

(λ = 2). The analogous result reported by Misbah14 contains a typo (140 should read 240).

Our relation (32) is in good quantitative agreement with the experimental data of Kantsler

and Steinberg7, as demonstrated on Figure 1. Eq. (31) implies that if ∆ > 4h2, i.e. viscosity

the linear small deformation theory (32).

If f20(0)

= 0, the f20(t) is also oscillating. All modes with j

= 2 decay to zero and are not

oscillating.

The time–periodic vesicle deformation depends strongly on the viscosity contrast as il-

lustrated on Figure 2. Figure 2 (a) shows that close to the critical viscosity contrast the

period of oscillations is long and the amplitude of oscillations of the f20 mode, which corre-

sponds to out-of-the-ﬂow-plane deformation, is signiﬁcant. Experimentally the vesicle looks

like trembling or “breathing”8,9. The “breathing” motion has been discussed in parts by

Misbah14 although the role of the f20 mode has not been made clear.

The mode oscillation frequency increases with viscosity contrast, as seen on Figure 2

(b). At high viscosity contrast it approaches the twice rate of rotation of the external ﬂow,

˙γ. This can be seen from Eq.

(26) where in the limit λ

1 only the rotation terms

≫

survive. Since the f20 mode is not rotationally stabilized, its oscillation amplitude becomes

negligible at high viscosity contrast; correspondingly the out-of-the-ﬂow-plane deformation is

suppressed. The periodic vesicle deformation is corresponds to rigid body rotation, f ′

A good agreement was obtained for the angle evolution, for example of their vesicle number

6 using reduced volume 0.988 instead of the reported 0.996. The diﬀerence is reasonable

given the uncertainty with which the reduced volume is determined experimentally:

it is

computed assuming axial symmetry about the vesicle longest axis, which might not be

always the case because of the presence of a non-zero f20 mode. Note that in the tank–

treading regime, however, since the excess area is stored only in the f2±2 modes the vesicle

is a prolate ellipsoid and the computation of the reduced volume is quite accurate. We also

attempted to reproduce theoretically the experimental curves on Figure 4 of Kantsler and

Steinberg8. The predicted tumbling frequency from Eq. (38) using viscosity contrast and

excess area close the reported values was almost twice higher than the experimental data.

One possible explanation is that our small–deformation theory fails for the large values of

the excess area in this experiment (∆

and in the tank–treading regime it approaches a limiting value

which is obtained by inserting the expression for the modes amplitude (C10) in (41) and

taking into account (C12). Eﬀective viscosity decreases from the value for a suspension of

rigid spheres with the increase of the excess area because the deformable vesicles elongate

and thus oﬀer less resistance to the ﬂow. Increasing viscosity contrast also leads to decrease

in the eﬀective viscosity because vesicles align with the ﬂow (the inclination angle (32)

Unlike the suspension of rigid spheres, a suspension of deformable vesicles exhibits normal

stresses. In the tank–treading regime below the critical viscosity contrast, the magnitudes

decreases).

D. Vesicle migration in the presence of wall

Knowledge of the normal stresses provides a quantitative insight into the phenomenon

of vesicle lift–oﬀ from the wall in a wall–bounded shear ﬂow. If the distance to the wall

is much larger than the vesicle radius, the vesicle drift velocity normal to the rigid wall

is proportional to the stress component in the direction of the plane unit normal30, i.e.

Tyy, Ulift =

3/16h2Tyy. Combining Smart and Leighton’s result30 and our expression for

Tyy =

Hence, the lift velocity far way from the wall can be estimated using the normal stresses

expressions (43) and we obtain the relation

Similar type expressions have been reported in analytical studies22,31, although the depen-

dence on the excess area has not been presented in an explicit form. Eq. (46) shows that the

more deformable the vesicle, i.e. the larger the excess area, the larger the migration veloc-
ity. Interestingly, at very small excess area we obtain from (43) that N1 ∼
migration is independent of the viscosity contrast. The values of the prefactor (46) are of

V. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

This study explores the eﬀect of viscosity contrast and membrane bending rigidity on

vesicle behavior in simple shear ﬂow and the rheology of a dilute suspension of vesicles. We

developed a leading order small deformation theory to describe the dynamics of a vesicle

in linear viscous ﬂows. Expressions for the shape evolution equation, stress and velocity

ﬁelds and the eﬀective membrane tension, which is needed to enforce the area constraint,

were derived using a formalism based on spherical harmonics. The main theoretical result

of this study is contained in the shape evolution equation Eq. (24) and the expression for

the eﬀective tension Eq. (D5). The latter serves to eliminate the tension in favor of the

excess area, which is the physically relevant parameter. The solution is applicable for any

linear ﬂow under transient or steady state conditions. In the case of simple shear ﬂow, only

the shape modes with the same spherical harmonic order as the external ﬂow, j = 2, are

perturbed; all other modes decay on a time scale set by the bending rigidity. Consequently,

the shape evolution equations simplify to Eq. (26) and yields expressions for quantities

that can be measured experimentally such as the inclination angle with respect to the ﬂow

direction, the lengths of the major and minor axes of the vesicle contour in the ﬂow plane,

etc. In the stationary tank–treading state, we show that in a simple shear ﬂow the leading

order deformation and stresses are independent of the membrane bending rigidity. Our

theory is in quantitative agreement with experimental data for the vesicle deformation in the

tank–treading and in the tumbling regimes. Non–Newtonian rheology with shear thinning

viscosity and normal stresses is predicted for a suspension of vesicles. We also considered

the vesicle dynamics in wall–bounded shear ﬂow and presented a simple derivation of the

leading order correction, in the distance to the wall, to the rate of vesicle migration away

from the wall.

Several problems remain open. We discussed the main features of the time–dependent

vesicle dynamics in linear ﬂows, but this problem remains to be systematically explored.

Although the quantitative agreement between predicted and experimentally observed9 be-

havior of tumbling vesicles with small excess area is encouragingly good, for vesicles with

16

large excess area8 the agreement is poor, which might be due to the limitations of the lead-

ing order theory. Our analysis will be extended to consider higher–order perturbations, and

hence elucidate the feedback from the ﬂow on vesicle dynamics. Numerical simulations with

a three–dimensional boundary integral method are being developed to explore the dynamics

of highly non–spherical vesicle shapes. In wall–bounded ﬂows, a more detailed description

of the vesicle–wall hydrodynamic interactions in needed in order to predict the lift force

quantitatively.

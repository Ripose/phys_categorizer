The pump process of the ratchet model inspired by the Fo rotatory motor of ATP synthase
is investigated.
In this model there are two kinds of characteristic time. One is dynamical, the
relaxation time of the system. Others are chemical, the chemical reaction rates at which a proton
binds to or dissociates from the motor protein. The inequalities between them aﬀect the behavior
of the physical quantities, such as the rotation velocity and the proton pumping rates across the
membrane. The energy transduction eﬃciency is calculated and the condition under which the
eﬃciency can become higher is discussed. The proton pumping rate and the eﬃciency have a peak
where a certain set of inequalities between the chemical reaction rates and the reciprocal of the
relaxation time holds. The eﬃciency also has a peak for a certain value of the load. The best
eﬃciency condition for the pump process is consistent with that for the motor process.

INTRODUCTION

Biomolecular motors are kinds of protein molecules
which generate a unidirectional motion in the situation
that many surrounding molecules, e.g. water molecules,
collide with the protein molecule many times due to ther-
mal ﬂuctuation[1, 2]. They play many essential roles in
life; muscle contraction, transport in cells, etc. It is inter-
esting and important question how motor proteins gen-
erate a unidirectional motion. It is natural to think that
they utilize this random ﬂuctuation by the collision, al-
though there has been no unambiguous evidence reported
so far that this is essential.

Ratchet systems, which take out a net ﬁnite current
from random and undirected noise, have been intensively
investigated for modeling molecular motors[3]. As known
by the famous Feynman’s lecture[4] and many investiga-
tions thereafter[5, 6, 7, 8], a net ﬁnite directed motion is
the consequence of the violation of the symmetry of the
system, e.g. the spatial form of the potential. In mod-
eling molecular motors, the system also needs to violate
the detailed balance between several diﬀerent states, i.e.
conformations. The detailed balance is violated by the
undirected chemical energy supply, e.g.
the ATP hy-
drolysis. Ratchet systems are applied to various physical
systems other than modeling molecular motors[6, 7, 8].
The Fo part of the ATP synthase is known as a rota-
tory molecular energy transducer[9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. It is
embedded in the membrane, and transduces the energy of
the transmembrane proton concentration gradient, when
a proton passes through the membrane via the Fo part,
into that of the rotation of its internal subunits in the
motor process. The ratchet model of it was presented
qualitatively by Junge, Lill and Engelbrecht[14]. Elston,
Wang, and Oster improved this model by taking account
of the electrostatic interaction between the residues [15].
This ratchet model has an advantage that the coupling
between the rotation and the proton ﬂow is easy to see,
therefore the energy transduction eﬃciency is easily esti-

mated. In this model, there are two important kinds of
characteristic time, dynamical and chemical. The former
is the relaxation time of the convection-diﬀusion system.
The latter are the chemical reaction rates at which a pro-
ton binds to or dissociate from the motor protein when
it passes through the membrane. We investigated the ef-
ﬁciency in detail and pointed out that in the motor pro-
cess, the inequalities between them aﬀect the behavior of
it [16]. For the motor to work most eﬃciently, certain
inequalities between them need to hold.

The Fo part also works as a pump[17]; it gains en-
ergy from the (inverse) rotation and pumps out protons
against the transmembrane proton gradient. Which pro-
cess this protein adopts, motor or pump, under a given
condition and what controls this determination are im-
portant questions, but satisfying answers to these have
not been obtained so far.

In this paper we investigate the physical quantities in
the pump process, such as the rotation velocity, the pro-
ton pumping rate, and the energy transduction eﬃciency.
The condition under which the protein works as a pump
with higher eﬃciency is discussed. We will compare the
most eﬃcient condition for the pump process with that
for the motor process.

II. MODEL

The ATP synthase is schematically shown in FIG.1(a).
The upper side of the ﬁgure is the basic (inner) side of
the cell and the lower side is the acidic (outer) side. The
proton concentration of the acidic side is kept higher than
that of the basic side by respiratory chains. The Fo part
is composed of the subunits denoted by the Roman let-
ters, a, b, and c, and the F1 part by the Greek letters,
α, β, γ, and δ. The rotating ring (the c-ring)is com-
posed of the assembly of the c-subunits, each of which
has a proton binding site, carboxyrate Asp61, almost in
the middle of itself. The a-subunit is ﬁxed in the mem-

brane. The proton channel is the interface between the
a-subunit and the c-ring. There are two c-subunits and
two proton paths in the channel. One of the paths con-
nects the left binding site of the c-subunits to the ba-
sic side and the other connects the right binding site to
the acidic side. The other c-subunits are in the mem-
brane. The proton binding site can be both protonated
and unprotonated only if it is in the channel. Otherwise it
can be only protonated due to the hydrophobicity of the
membrane. The conformational change of the c-subunits
between the two states, protonated and unprotonated, is
small[12] and we neglect the eﬀect on the place of the
binding sites. The states of the c-ring are determined
by protonations of the two proton binding sites in the
channel; the empty(E) state with the both binding sites
unprotonated, the right(R) state with the right binding
site protonated and the left binding site unprotonated,
the left(L) state with the left binding site protonated
and the right binding site unprotonated, and the full(F)
state with the both binding sites protonated. As a motor
the c-ring rotates rightward and as a pump leftward in
FIG.1. The γ- subunit connects the Fo part to the F1
part.

We investigate this system by using the ’simply bi-
It works as follows:
ased diﬀusion model’ [14, 15, 16].
The c-ring moves randomly by collision with surround-
ing molecules and is forced to rotate by the external load
from the F1 part. But the hydrophobic interaction pre-
vents the unprotonated binding site from moving into the
membrane, i.e. the E and R states cannot move leftward
out of the channel and the E and L states not rightward.
If the chemical reaction rates, at which a proton binds
to or dissociates from the binding sites in the channel,
are tuned appropriately, it becomes possible to take out
a net motion against the load or to pump protons against
the concentration gradient.

We consider the pump process of this system. A proton
passes through the channel from the basic side to the
acidic side as follows: First a proton in the basic side
ﬂows into the channel and binds to the left binding site.
Next the proton goes through the membrane with the
leftward rotation of the c-ring. Finally the proton comes
back to the channel, dissociates from the right binding
site, and ﬂows out to the acidic side. In this way, a proton
is pumped out by the rotation of the c-ring driven by
the external load, which is gained by the energy of the
ATP hydrolysis in the external part. We assume that
in the pump process, the external load exerted is larger
than that in the motor process, so that the c-ring can
rotate leftward. In this sense, the external ’load’ should
be exactly called ’driving force’ of the rotation in the
pump process. However, we will use the term ’load’ in
the pump process since we deal with the same model as
in the motor process.

First of all, we give a qualitative consideration of the
energy transduction, the coupling between the rotation
and the proton ﬂow. The good process in the channel
is shown in FIG.2: A proton binds to the left binding

FIG. 1: The upper ﬁgure (a) is the ATP synthase. When it
operates, the shaded parts (γ, ǫ, and the c-ring) rotate.
In
the pump process, the external load force from F1 rotates the
c-ring in the direction of the arrow and pumps out a proton
from the upper to the lower side. This direction of rotation
is opposite to that in the motor process. In the lower ﬁgures,
(b), the states of the c-ring are shown. The rectangle frame is
the proton channel viewed from the a-subunit and the shaded
region is the c-ring. The states depend on the protonations
of the two proton binding sites in the channel. The ﬁgure (a)
corresponds to the R-state.

site in the left ﬁgure. Then the c-ring moves one step
leftward in the center ﬁgure. Finally the proton bound
to the right binding site dissociates in the right ﬁgure
and the process returns back to the start. In this process
one step of the c-ring rotation corresponds to one proton
pumping. This is the eﬃcient energy transduction. A
bad process is shown in FIG.3. In the upper-right ﬁg-
ure, a proton binds to the left binding site before the
proton bound to the right binding site dissociates. Then
in the lower-right ﬁgure, the c-ring moves leftward with-
out proton dissociation. Therefore more than one step of
the rotation corresponds to one proton pumping. In this
process the energy is transduced ineﬃciently. Another
bad process is shown in FIG.4. In the upper-middle ﬁg-
ure, a proton binds to the right binding site from the
acidic side before the rotation of the c-ring. Next the
c-ring rotates leftward in the upper-right ﬁgure. Finally
the proton bound to the left binding site dissociates then
the c-ring rotates rightward due to diﬀusion. In this pro-
cess, a proton passes through the membrane along the

of the c-ring. These bad processes generate the loss of
the energy transduction. For the higher eﬃciency, the
good process should become more and the bad processes
should become less.

Here p(x, t) is 4-component probability where pi(x, t) de-
scribes the probability that the c-ring in state i is at posi-
tion x at time t. The state index i refers to the state men-
tioned before; E, R, L, and F. Similarly, Π describes the
ﬂow of the probability. ˆK is the transition matrix which
describes changes between the states and will be given
later. D and γ are the diﬀusion constant and the friction
constant, respectively. They satisfy the Einstein’s rela-
tion, D = γkBT where T is the temperature and kB is
the Boltzmann constant. The matrix ˆf = diag[τ, τ, τ, τ ]
is the external load. The position variable x is deﬁned
as the rotation angle with the origin placed at the cen-
ter of the c-ring and takes its value from 0 to δ = 2π/N
where N denotes the number of c-subunit consisting in
the c-ring. (See Fig.5.) Hereafter, we ﬁx N =12, which
is the case of E.Coli. The position x = 0 is deﬁned as the
situation where the left binding site is at the left bound-
ary of the channel and x = δ is as that where the right
binding site is at the right boundary of the channel.

As mentioned earlier, the conformational change of the
c-subunit due to the protonation of the binding site is
small. Therefore we have assumed that all the state take
the common values of the diﬀusion constant D and the

4

friction constant γ. As an eﬀect of the conformational
change, we will only take account of the hydrophobic-
ity, which determines whether or not a c-subunit in the
channel can move into the membrane.

The system has a periodicity in the sense that when
one binding site in the channel goes out and moves into
the membrane, another binding site comes into the chan-
nel. This periodicity and the hydrophobicity impose the
boundary conditions on the ﬂows,

ΠE(0, t) = ΠE(δ, t) = 0,

ΠR(0, t) = ΠL(δ, t) = 0,

ΠL(0, t) = ΠR(δ, t),

ΠF(0, t) = ΠF(δ, t).

pR(δ) = pL(0),

and,

Similarly, the following boundary conditions of the prob-
abilities are imposed,

pF (δ) = pF (0).

eﬃciency of the energy transduction[19]. The energy in-
put per unit time is deﬁned as the product of the external
load torque τ and the rotation velocity, hvi. The energy
output per unit time is the product of the free energy
due to the transmembrane proton gradient, ∆G, and the
proton pumping rate, Np(H+). Therefore the eﬃciency
e is deﬁned as,

e ≡

The parameters used for the calculation are, according to
Ref.[15], given in TABLE.I. They are plausible values in
living things. In our previous work [16], we pointed out
that the inequalities between the chemical reaction rates,
ki
j’s, each other and the reciprocal of the relaxation time
−1
relax = (γτ )2/D, aﬀect the behavior of
of the system, T
the physical quantities in the motor process. It is natural
to expect that these inequalities also play important roles
in the pump process. The chemical reaction rates depend
on many kinds of factor, e.g. the diﬀusion constant of
the proton, the acidity of the proton binding site, the
concentrations of proton of both sides, etc. The overall
factor 10K means the eﬀective proton absorption rate
of the path, which is regarded as common for all the
transition rates.

The free energy accompanying the proton transloca-
tion due to the transmembrane proton gradient is given
as

∆G = V + kBT ln[10∆pH]

= 31.6[pN · nm],

where ∆pH = pHB − pHA. The detailed balance is vio-
lated by this free energy and the pumping is against this
energy.

der which our model works well as a motor. We take the
value of the acidity of proton binding site, pKa=4.5 and
5.5 as typical value which gives the set of inequalities 1)

The external load τ is also regarded as a controllable
parameter, since the load has not been so far measured
experimentally in the pump process we discuss here.

The rotation velocity hvi is plotted in FIGs.6 and 7 in
the case 1) and 2), respectively. There is no qualitative
diﬀerence between two cases. There is almost no rota-
tion when K is small, i.e. the chemical reaction rates are
low. Then it monotonically increases and ﬁnally satu-
rates at K >15, which is out of the ﬁgures. As expected,
it becomes faster for the larger load.

The proton pumping rate Np(H+) is plotted in FIGs.8
and 9. Almost no pumping is observed for small K in
both cases. Then it increases as K increases. It reaches
a peak at a certain ﬁnite value of K, such that kL

out is required to
cess. Firstly, the inequality T
suppress the bad process shown in FIG.4. If the inequal-
ity is not satisﬁed, the left binding site in the channel
becomes unprotonated before the relaxation by the ﬂuc-
tuation hence it cannot move into the membrane. As a
result the bad process in FIG.4 can occur easily. Sec-
−1
ondly, the inequality kL
load indicates that the bad
process shown in FIG.3, rotation without proton pump-
ing, rarely occurs. Thirdly, the inequality kR

in,
which distinguishes the case 1) from 2), is needed to pre-
vent the c-ring from moving rightward.

out > T

For τopt, we note that it is determined in highly non-
trivial manners. To see this, let us go back to Eq.(27). As
we see in FIGs.6-9, both the numerator of Eq.(27), which
is proportional to the proton pumping rate Np(H+), and
the denominator, which is proportional to the rotation
velocity hvi and the load τ , increase monotonically as the
load increases. Therefore, the subtle diﬀerence between
the increasing rates of them determines τopt.

IV. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We have investigated the pump process of the ratchet
model of the rotatory molecular motor. The model can
be solved analytically and the physical quantities such as
the rotation velocity and the proton pumping rate are cal-
culated. The energy transduction eﬃciency is obtained
from these physical quantities. The best eﬃciency condi-

tion is that the set of inequalities T

τopt.

We compare the result obtained here with that for the
motor process.
In Ref.[16] we ﬁnd that the most eﬃ-
cient condition for the motor process is that the set of
inequalities kL
in holds, under
the experimentally reported load, τ ∼ 40pN·nm [18]. The
set of inequalities required between the chemical reaction

rates coincide with that for the pump process obtained
here. Therefore the Fo part can work both as a motor
and a pump eﬃciently by tuning the load τ . In this sense
these conditions are consistent.

As far as we know, experiments which directly mea-
sures the physical quantities, such as the rotation ve-
locity and the pumping rate, have not been reported so
far. However an experiment has been reported that in a
whole FoF1 ATP synthase the conformational change of
one subunit of F1 part suppresses electronically and/or
sterically the rotation hydrolysing ATP[17]. This eﬀect
may be interpreted to vary the load eﬀectively and con-
trol which process occurs.

In the model we considered here, only the diﬀusion

process is taken into account. The highest eﬃciency ob-
tained is e ∼0.3, and it seems to be not high enough, since
molecular motors are thought to transduce energy almost
without loss [18]. There are several possibilities to solve
this problem. The ﬁrst is to reconsider the deﬁnition
of the eﬃciency (27), since our deﬁnition, following the
argument in Ref.[19], is diﬀerent from that in Ref.[18].
The second is to reconsider the relations between physi-
cal quantities appropriate near the equilibrium, such as
the Einstein’s relation, since the system is far from equi-
librium. The third is to introduce another mechanism,
such as the electrostatic interaction between residues in
Ref.[15]. These may lead to our better understanding of
the energetics of non-equilibrium systems.

Melanins are a group of complex pigments of biological origin, widely
spread in all species from fungi to man. Among diverse types of melanins,
the human melanins, eumelanins, are brown or black nitrogen-containing
pigments, mostly known for their photoprotective properties in human skin.
We have undertaken theoretical studies aimed to understand absorption
spectra of eumelanins and their chemical precursors. The structure of the
biopigment is poorly deﬁned, although it is believed to be composed of
cross-linked heteropolymers based on indolequinones. As a basic model
of the eumelanin structure, we have chosen pentamers containing hydro-
quinones (HQ) and/or 5,6-indolequinones (IQ) and/or semiquinones (SQ)
often listed as structural melanin monomers. The eumelanin oligomers
have been constructed as random compositions of basic monomers and
opitimized for the energy of bonding. Absorption spectra of model assem-
blies have been calculated within the semiempirical intermediate neglect
of diﬀerential overlap (INDO) approximation. Model spectrum of eume-
lanin has been further obtained by sum of independent spectra of singular
polymers. By comparison with experimental data it is shown that the
INDO/CI method manages to reproduce well characteristic properties of
experimental spectrum of synthetic eumelanins.

Melanins are ubiquitous natural pigments formed by oxidation and poly-
merization of catechols [1, 2]. Black or dark brown nitrogen-containing

melanins are classiﬁed as eumelanins distinctly from pheomelanins - whose
lighter coloring originates from intervention of cysteine in the process of
melanogenesis, and allomelanins - which originate from nitrogen-free pre-
cursors and are typical of plants and microorganisms. The melanogens -
uncoloured precursors of melanins of the animal kingdom - are diphenols
derived from phenylalanine and from tyrosine. The melanin pigments are
amorphous substances of remarkable ability to absorb almost indiscrimi-
nately near-infrared, visible and ultraviolet radiation [2, 3]. Exploiting these
properties of melanins has proven to be a complex task, since despite sig-
niﬁcant experimental eﬀort on a variety of natural and synthetic melanins,
the molecular structure of the pigment and its organization remains still un-
known. Poorly understood are also functional properties of natural melanin
pigments which call for attention because of their both - photoprotective
and photosensitizing properties.

In this paper we will focus on hypothesis which concludes on spectroscopic
properties of melanins assuming their polymeric amorphous structure. Our
studies concern eumelanins which are known as complex broadband ab-
sorbers, frequently subject to excitation in its native environments. Eu-
melanin is mainly derived from 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI; for simplicity
named also hydroquinone, HQ) and 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid
(DHICA) [4]. The detailed structural properties of this polymer are still
under study because of unclear covalent and ionic conﬁgurations of HQ
and DHICA monomers within the natural eumelanin unit. It is possible,
however, to produce synthetically pure DHI or DHICA melanin.
In this
respect, theoretical studies presented in this paper relate to synthetic eu-
melanins that are free or almost free from the DHICA contribution in the
structure.
Absorption bands of eumelanins have been recently [5, 6, 7] shown to depend
on diﬀerent levels of aggregation reported in scanning electron microscopy
studies. The proposed aggregation structure is generally viewed as a molec-
ular system containing 3-4 oligomers, often referred to in literature [6, 7]
as the fundamental aggregate. The hypothetical pigment structure is then
believed to be assembled from these π stacked, crosslinked units.

In an earlier attempt to explain electronic (and optical) properties of melanins
(cf. Figure 1), a band model [8, 9] viewing melanins as amorphous semicon-
ductors has been proposed. In fact, melanins can be considered as mixtures
of more or less similar polymers, apparently made up of diﬀerent structural
units linked through heterogenous non-hydrozable bonds. The latter are the
result of the polymerization of indole-type rings in both, the quinone and
hydroquinone oxidation state, randomly crosslinked and piled. Theoretical

contributions on a speculative model [10, 11] pictured eumelanins as a lin-
ear chain semiconducting polymer. Extrapolating the bonding character of
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of one particular dimer
of 5, 6-indolequinone to the lowest conduction band of the inﬁnite polymer,
Pullman and Pullman [11] have pointed out the tendency of such a melanin
model to be an electron acceptor that could explain trapping of free radicals
characteristic for the natural and synthetic pigments.
More recent studies along similar lines have been performed by Galv˜ao and
Caldas [12, 13, 14]. Using the H¨uckel π-electron approximation and the
parametrization of Pullman [11], the authors studied the electronic struc-
ture of a family of ideal ordered polymers arising from the indolequinone in
diﬀerent redox states. It has been shown that the direction of polymeriza-
tion begins to emerge as the length of the polymer increases. The authors
pointed out also that the redox state of the melanin units played a role
in its band structure, as e.g. the polymer built from 5,6-dihydroxyindole
units exhibited larger gaps and narrower bands, whereas ﬁnite chains of
semiquinone units exhibited bonding character of their LUMO.

Some limitation of this approach is the assumption of planarity of melanin
polymers, which in most cases does not need to be the case. In fact, struc-
tural modelling of eumelanins based on comparing calculated data of the
reduced structure factor and radial distribution function for limited random
network models with the experimental X-ray scattering data [15] suggest

that planar models consisting of undistorted long chains are not appropri-
ate structures for amorphous melanins.

We have thus considered the role of conformational variations of eumelanins’
oligomers in modifying and modulation of their light-absorption properties.
According to the existing evidence [1, 2, 3, 16, 17] that the 5,6-indolequinone
(IQ) or the reduced forms, semiquinone (SQ) and hydroquinone (HQ) com-
pose the major part of the active pigment, these three basic units (cf. Figure
1) in their neutral forms have been used to build up model polymeric struc-
tures.

When focusing on oligomeric models of eumelanins, we have assumed in
consistency with the wide-angle X-ray diﬀraction measurements of synthetic
eumelanin samples and STM images of monolayers of synthetic eumelanins
on graphite [5, 15], that a fundamental building block of the polymer is a
structure consisting of several (4-10) 5,6-indolequinone residues composed in
π-system molecular stacks. Therefore, as a starting model unit for a higher
order polymeric structure of eumelanin a pentamer containing HQ, IQ or
SQ molecules has been chosen and subsequently used to analyze randomly
created structures of various conformations. Pentamer structures with var-
ious proportions of HQ, IQ and SQ content have been constructed from

geometrically optimized monomers and further analyzed for their spectro-
scopic properties. All oligomer models have been built by using ”Random
Polymer Builder” module of the Cerius2/ MSI packet [23].

In assessing electronic spectral properties of modelled molecular struc-
tures, we report here results from the spectroscopic ZINDO/s calculations
developed by Zerner [18] and co-workers. The method is based on re-
parametrization of the semi-empirical INDO (Intermediate Neglect of Dif-
ferential Overlap) approach that includes monoatomic diﬀerential overlap
for one-centre integrals (i.e. integrals involving basis functions on the same
atom). These calculations yield absorption maxima which establish that the
diﬀerences in mixing ratios of various monomeric units in an overall poly-
meric structure of eumelanins can inﬂuence and alter absorption spectrum
of the oligomer.

2. Computational models

In order to pinpoint the factors controlling the spectra of eumelanin
polymers, the model subunits have been treated at several levels of struc-
tural elaborations. As basic components of eumelanins 5,6-dihydroxyindole
(HQ), 5,6-indolequinone (IQ) and semiquinone (SQ) (see Figure 2.) have
been chosen. Since experimental data on the geometry of the molecules
in Figure 2 are not available, the bare skeletons of indole molecules have
been edited by a molecular editor in the InsightII/MSI module and fur-
ther geometrically optimized by use of either ab initio Gaussian-94 [19] or
semiempirical consistent valence forceﬁeld (CVFF) method. In both cases
the energies for conformation were minimized until the convergence was
achieved (the maximum derivative was less than 0.0001 kcal mol−1˚A−1).
The augmented CVFF program has been developed for material science ap-
plications [20] and is considered a standard forceﬁeld to be used for organic
molecules and polymers. As a default forceﬁeld in Discover 95.0 molecular
dynamics simulation package, it has been extensively used over the past
years and is usually considered [20, 22, 23] well tested and characterized. It
is primarily intended for studies of structures and binding energies, although
is known also to predict satisfactorily frequencies in vibrational spectra as
well as conformational energies.
Structures optimized by CVFF method have been further used as input
parameters for spectroscopic ZINDO [18] calculations. The method cir-
cumvents cumbersome and time-consuming ab initio treatment of complex
systems and is one of commonly used semiempirical molecular orbital (MO)
methods. Over the last decade it has been succesfully applied in the study
of bulk solids and defects in semiconductors [21]. The INDO electronic cal-

molecular orbital procedure with the conﬁguration interaction (CI). Within

produced by ﬁlling the orbitals with all electrons in the order of increasing

The SCF calculations done with a set of M basis functions require the
computation of M 4 matrix elements. In order to make a treatment of large
molecules possible, one has to reduce the complexity by either replacing the
eﬀect of inner core electrons by eﬀective (pseudo-) potentials or by applying
the semi-empirical SCF method which neglects most of the matrix elements

where φA
µ is the atomic orbital centered on atom A. In order to maintain ro-
tational invariance, two–center integrals (A 6= C) are evaluated over atomic
orbitals ˜φA
µ that are s symmetric but have the same exponents and expansion
coeﬃcients as φA
µ . The one-center core integrals hµµ are obtained from ion-
ization potentials and the resonance integrals (the two-center hµν integrals)
are purely empirical parameters set to reproduce experimental spectra. The
method as employed herein leads to the ground electronic states obtained as
closed-shell molecular orbital wave functions in the restricted Hartree-Fock
(RHF) framework. In the next step, low lying excited states were approx-
imated by conﬁguration interactions (CI) among conﬁgurations generated
as single excitations from RHF ground state. The CI method included the
highest 15 occupied and lowest 15 unoccupied molecular orbitals. 1

All polymers were arbitrarily chosen as pentamers built by use of the ”Ran-
dom Polymer Builder” module of the MSI packet[23]. Four diﬀerent groups
of polymers: homogenous polyHQ, polySQ, polyIQ (cf. Figure 3) and het-
eropolymers ( i.e. pentamers built up from basic units with random ratios
of molecules HQ:IQ:SQ) were investigated. The polymer structures were
formed by deﬁning all possible pairs of ”head” and ”tail” positions out of
5 labeled centers (see Figure 2) located on a monomer. Structural conﬁg-
uration models of pentamers have been then developed along the polymer-
ization direction in which ”heads” were joined with ”tails” of subsequent
monomers. Resulting pentamer structures (cf. Figure 3) can be either lin-
ear and ﬂat, nonplanar linear or forked structures, respectively. Despite
their various conformational structures, all three groups are characterized
by a mean dimension (measured as a maximum observable distance between
non-hydrogen atoms in a model pentamer form) of about 2nm and molec-
ular weight about 720-740, i.e. with M W < 1000. If assuming that such

units are basic chromophores in the eumelanin structure, the models predict
that there are about of million of such pentamers in a melanin subunit of
an average diameter 150 − 200nm [24, 15].
Heteropolymeric structures have been created either with equal probabili-
ties of choosing IQ, SQ or HQ molecule at each step of polymerization, or
by using IQ and HQ monomers only, i.e with the HQ:IQ:SQ probability
proportion taken as 3:1:0. The latter choice switches oﬀ the reduced form
of IQ, the component SQ, that is mainly responsible for formation of free
radicals produced during melanin synthesis [2]. The planar and non-planar
conformations were analyzed seeking for their eﬀect on absorption spec-
tra. Models of planar linear polymers (each monomer had no more than 2
bonds), planar forked polymers and non-planar linear polymers (see Figure
3.) have been investigated for their absorption spectra, calculated solely for
neutral structures by using ZINDO-CI method.

rounding medium (composed of the set of randomly distribured similar
oligomeric units) can be a source of ﬂuctuations in the electronic gap energy
between the ground and excited state. To account for these ﬂuctuations and
their eﬀect on the system response to a radiation ﬁeld, we have presented
calculated spectra adopting a Brownian oscillator model [25] that relates
variability in the electronic gap to displacements in some dynamical vari-
able x representing the system under consideration.
In the linear regime
(weak coupling to the perturbing external radiation ﬁeld), the ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem relates the system’s response function to the derivative
of the correlation function C(t) =< x(t)x(t′) > with brackets representing
an equilibrium average. In the Brownian oscillator model the equilibrium
states are deﬁned by incorporating a model of the bath represented by a
Gaussian stochastic force f (t) acting on a variable x:

mi¨xi(t) + miω2

i xi(t) + mi Z

−∞

t

dτ γi(t − τ ) ˙xi(τ ) = fi(t) + Fi(t)

(2.7)

where mi, Fi(t) stand for the ”mass” of a mode xi and an external driving
force, respectively. The correlation of the random force is related to the
dissipative term (friction), i.e. < fi(t)fk(t′) >= δik2mikBT γi(t − t′). The
variation of the friction term with time (or frequency) reﬂects the timescale
of the thermal motions of the bath. By assuming that the latter are very fast
compared to the oscillator motion, we accept the ohmic dissipation model
with γi being a constant. In a strongly overdamped case (γi >> 2ωi) and
in a fast modulation limit [25], the absorption lineshape calculated as

with the line width Γ proportional to the product of characteristic nuclear
time scale (characteristic time scale of medium relaxation) and a coupling
strength of the nuclear degrees of freedom to the electronic transition. With-
out discussing the origin of the particular choice of the lineshape in more de-
tails, we have thus arbitrarily adopted that the energy transitions calculated
for the model system were Lorentzian enveloped and summed, weighted with
an oscillator strength to simulate the overall absorption spectra. Diﬀerently
chosen values of Γ reﬂect then the degree of dissipation of absorbed energy
via coupling to the bath.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Monomers

Geometrical features of the ground state monomers used in this study
have been compared with optimized coordinates from ab initio Gaussian 94
calculations. In accordance with the previous analysis by Bolivar-Marinez
et al. [14], various methods of optimization result in small variation of main
bond lengths and bond and dihedral angles yielding structures that are basi-
cally planar. This feature is further reﬂected in the major π−π∗ character of
the HOMO-LUMO transition for all monomer molecules. To assess the reli-
ability of our calculations based on CVFF method combined with ZINDO/s
calculations in predicting spectral features of melanin’s derivatives, we have
calculated transition energies for the bare skeleton of HQ (with each omit-
ted substituent replaced by a hydrogen atom), after optimization by either
CVFF or PM3 method which has been used in a previous study [14]. The
ﬁrst transition line calculated in ZINDO was 306.5nm (296.6nm) for the
structure optimized with CVFF (PM3) program, respectively. This has
been compared with the ﬁrst transition line (300.3nm) calculated for the
”empirical” bare skeleton structure of tryptophan obtained from the Protein
Data Bank.

character of the calculated CI coeﬃcients and were comparable with the
previous theoretical [14] and experimental [17] works related to melanin’s
monomers.
Results of Gaussian/ZINDO and CVFF/ZINDO calculations on neutral
HQ, IQ and SQ monomers are presented in Table 2. The ﬁrst optically
active electronic transitions (ﬁrst row entry in Table 2) and the strongest
active electronic transition (second row entry in Table 2) exhibit shifts to-
wards longer wavelengths after CVFF structure optimization which allows
structures with some degree of non-planarity.
Reported transitions are dominated by a few conﬁgurations involving fron-
tier orbitals. Inspection of the calculated CI coeﬃcients reveals that about
70% of the ﬁrst excited state for HQ monomer is accounted for by HOMO→LU-
MO excitation and about 15% of HOMO-1→LUMO+1 excitation. The
strongest transition is composed of mixing among 2 highest occupied and 3
lowest unoccupied orbitals. The pattern of the ﬁrst excited state is essen-
tially preserved for SQ and IQ monomers where >96% of excitation comes
from HOMO→LUMO transition with remaining excitations contributing
with less than 1%.

3.2. Oligomers and Polymers

Figure 4 presents simulated optical absorption spectra of model poly-
mers. The curves have been obtained from the optical transition spectrum
enveloped by normalized Lorentzians weighted by the calculated oscillator
strength; i.e energies (λi) and oscillator strengths (si) obtained from calcu-
lations were converted to:

σabs(λ) =

(3.1)

with the width of a line set up arbitrarily to 10 (in units of λ). The graphs
refer to spectra of diﬀerent mixtures of polymers: the ﬁrst column displays
spectra of the uniform mixture of polyHQ polymers (i.e. pentamers com-
posed of HQ monomers, only), second and third columns show absorbance
spectra of similar uniform mixtures of polyIQ and polySQ, respectively.
The fourth column presents spectra of heteropolymers composed with equal
probabilities of choosing either one of three various monomers (i.e. with
HQ:IQ:SQ=1:1:1) at each step of the ”polymerization process” leading to a
basic pentamer structure. The last column displays spectra of nonuniform
polymers built by use of the proportion HQ:IQ:SQ = 3:1:0 at the basic
level of modelling. Rows in Figure 4 relate to spectra obtained for diﬀerent
conformations of polymers. The ﬁrst row represents mixtures of linear and

12

melspectra printed on January 2, 2014

planar polymers (cf. Figure 3), the second and third row display spectra of
linear nonplanar and planar forked polymers, respectively.

All spectra up to the last row in Figure 4 have been calculated as mix-
tures of 15 pentamers, whereas the bottom row shows sums of simulated
spectra for 45 polymers whose absorbance spectra are displayed in upper
three rows of each column. As an example, the third column and second
row of Figure 4 displays spectrum of 15 linear, nonplanar pentamers com-
posed of SQ monomers, only. Accordingly, the inlet in 5th column and 3rd
row presents absorption spectrum of 15 ”forking” pentamers composed of
HQ and IQ molecules taken in proportion 3:1 (with no contribution of SQ
molecules). Sum of spectra for various conformational structures of that
type is displayed in the bottom right corner of Figure 4.
As can be inferred from Figure 4, spectra of polyHQ have dominant con-
tributions within the range 200 − 400nm, whereas admixture of IQ or SQ
components results in a red shift of the absorption lines. Conformation
variations seem to result in varying intensity of absorption, it is ambiguous
however, to conclude on the overall eﬀect of conformations on spectra of
model polymers.

Figure 5 comprises model absorption spectra of ”higher order” poly-
mers: in the top left corner spectra of 45 polyHQ and 45 polyIQ oligomers
are displayed, second position in the ﬁrst column represents spectra of 45
polyHQ and 45 polySQ, whereas the bottom of ﬁrst column contains sim-
ulated spectra for mixture of 45 polyIQ and 45 polySQ polymers. For
comparison, spectra of mixture of three uniform oligomers (45 polyHQ +
45 polyIQ + 45 polySQ) have been displayed (second column and ﬁrst row
in Figure 5) along with 45 heteropolymers HQ:IQ:SQ=1:1:1 (second row)
and 45 nonuniform oligomers HQ:IQ:SQ = 3:1:0 (second column, third row).
Note that all “higher order” spectra of polymers are constructed as direct
sums (mixtures) of spectra of pentamers and as such they do not take into
account interactions among those units.
Simulated optical absorption spectra suggest that the main contribution to
the absorption in the range of 500 − 800nm may be attributed to the pres-
ence of SQ molecules in oligomeric structures. Shape of simulated spectrum
of mixtures of nonuniform polymers resembles experimental spectrum (Fig-
ure 1) for synthetic DOPA melanin. The maximum intensity of modelled
spectrum is, however, shifted to about 300nm, whereas the peak inten-
sity in the experimental spectrum is observed already at 200nm.
It can
be expected that additional modulation of spectrum may arise from some
environmental eﬀects. For example, presence of localized charges may be
a source of electrochromic shift in the spectrum with red or blue shifts in
transition energies determined by the sign and location of charges [26, 27].

by higher content of charged forms of IQ monomers in model structures. In
particular, it has been demonstrated in the previous theoretical study by
Bolivar-Marinez et al. [14] that negative ions of IQ, SQ and HQ molecules
(-1) begin to absorb at about 1.0eV. This eﬀect is responsible, however, for
the red shift in simulated optical absorption spectra of negatively charged
monomers.

Calculated optical spectra smoothen also and shift when assuming stronger

dissipation of excitation energies in the system, resulting in a broader width
of lines (see Figure 6).
In the case of heterogeneous oligomers models
(HQ:IQ:SQ = 3:1:0) fourfold higher line width parameter than originally
chosen leads to a single humped spectrum with a broad, structureless tail.
The eﬀect, however, does not alter signiﬁcantly absorbance in the 200nm
region.
Synthetic eumelanin whose properties have been modelled in this study
lacks a protein coat and therefore its optical spectrum does not match the

natural pigment, especially in the region about 250 − 270nm, where existing
evidence [24] of spectral features has been attributed to absorption of light
by protein environment.

4. CONCLUSIONS

The absorption spectra for model of eumelanins were calculated as-
suming melanin to be composed of mixture of various unit-polymers. All
molecules were parametrized as random pentamers of HQ, SQ and/or IQ.
The idea of ”mixed nature” of the pigment, composed of heterogeneous
oligomers in a random, not necessarily well organized assemblies is compat-
ible with experimental data. Simulated optical spectra manifest the eﬀect
of aggregation in oligomer conformation resulting in broadening of the ab-
sorbance arm in the region of 500 − 800nm. Peak intensity of spectra can
be correlated with the presence of neutral HQ monomers in model struc-
tures. At higher level of aggregation (135 pentamers and more), further
addition of a polymeric unit (a pentamer) to the existing structure does not
alter the character of the spectrum. Also, conformational deformations of

of radicals in a system of stacked oligomers and interpretation of factors
responsible for radical-trapping processes in eumelanins.

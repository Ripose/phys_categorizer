Abstract

It is shown that the Boltzmann kinetic theory for gas systems in-
volves mathematical and physical misconcepts and the picture of time
irreversibility given by it is actually misleading.

It is well-known that while the Newtonian formalism is time reversible the
kinetic equations, based almost entirely on the Newtonian formalism, are time
irreversible. At a time, this paradox served as a serious topic for a large number
of papers. Recent studies of non-equilibrium phenomena, such as those related
to turbulence, transport and chaos, constantly remind us that a good under-
standing of time irreversibility is of crucial importance in terms of knowing the
game nature plays. Keeping those things in mind, we shall here concern our-
selves with explication and implication of time irreversibility in classical physics.
It will be shown that the Boltzmann equation and the Boltzmann H-theorem,
though have been accepted and taught for more than 100 years, involve false
treatments, and the time irreversibility picture provided by the theory is actu-
ally misleading.

According to the standard theory[1], the evolution of dilute gas consisting of
hard sphere balls (referred to as particles hereafter) is described by the Boltz-
mann equation

To show the time irreversibility of it, the theory introduces a function[2]

H(t) =

drdv1f1(r, v1, t) ln f1(r, v1, t),

Z Z

which can be recognized as a form of negative entropy. By substituting (1) into
(2), the time derivative of H(t) is, with external forces neglected,

which is always less than zero except for gases that are in equilibrium. This
conclusion, called the Boltzmann H-theorem, was, and still is, regarded as a
great triumph of the Boltzmann theory, since it explained, rather generally,
macroscopic time irreversibility in terms of microscopic laws.

Notice that the derivation above speciﬁcally identiﬁes particle-to-particle
collisions as a mechanism responsible for time irreversibility. Interestingly, this
identiﬁcation, supposed to reveal the very secret of nature, confused, and contin-
ues to confuse, many scientists. The main reason lies in that the time irreversible
H-theorem is, as just shown, based on the properties of the Boltzmann colli-
sional operator, while the Boltzmann collisional operator itself is based on the
time reversibility of the Newtonian formalism.

To make things more perplexing, a clear-cut theorem in textbooks, while
based also on the Newtonian formalism and null boundary condition, tells us a
diﬀerent story[3]. The theorem, called the ρ − S theorem in this paper, goes as
follows. The entropy of a gas system is deﬁned as

(6)

(8)

where ρ is the grand distribution of the system in the grand phase space, Γ-
space. Diﬀerentiating S with respect to time yields

S = −k

dΓρ ln ρ,

Z

dS
dt

= −k

dΓ(ln ρ + 1)

Z

∂ρ
∂t

.

Substituting Liouville’s theorem ∂ρ/∂t + [ρ, H] = 0 into (7), we ﬁnally get, after
a few mathematical steps,

which literally means that interactions between particles themselves, no matter
what kinds of forms they take, are not responsible for time irreversibility.

The situation is quite rare in science: the conﬂicting physical conclusions
are drawn from the same physical assumptions via the diﬀerent mathematical
treatments. After a careful investigation, we are now convinced that it is the
Boltzmann theory, not the ρ − S theorem, that involves misconcepts in the
mathematical sense.

In what follows, we ﬁrst study the usual concept of time reversibility, which

is at the basis of the Boltzmann collisional operator.

Consider two identical particles (still distinguishable according to classi-
cal physics). The initial and ﬁnal velocities of them are denoted by v1, v2

2 respectively. The usual concept of time reversibility states that if
2 is physically possible, then the inverse collision
2 → −v1, −v2 is also physically possible, which is trivial and not worth

1, v′

Then, we are concerned with whether or not there is time reversibility in
terms of beam-to-beam collisions. Apparently, time reversibility of this type
is much more relevant to the Boltzmann collisional operator. To our great
surprise, we cannot ﬁnd out any type of time reversibility related to beam-to-
beam collisions: neither an intuitive one, nor a mathematical one.

Figure 1: A candidate for time reversibility of beam-to-beam col-
lision: (a) the original collisions; and (b) inverse collisions imag-
ined.

Intuitively, we may consider the pictures shown in Fig. 1 as a ‘candidate’
for the time reversibility of beam-to-beam collision. Fig. 1a shows that two
particle beams at two deﬁnite velocities collide and the particles produced by
the collisions diverge in the spatial space. Fig. 1b illustrates that many diﬀerent
converging beams collide and the produced particles form two beams, each of
which has one deﬁnite velocity. In no need of discussion, we all ﬁnd that the
ﬁrst picture makes sense, while the second one does not.

In deriving the Boltzmann collisional operator, the following mathematical

deﬁnition of time reversibility has been employed[1]:

where the cross section σ(v1, v2 → v′

An unfortunate problem with (9) is that (10) is ill-deﬁned. For the colli-
sions between two given beams with v1 and v2 respectively, the energy and
momentum conservation laws imply that v′

2. Referring to the ﬁgures, we see that v′

where c is the center-of-mass velocity and u is the relative speed. Fig. 2a shows
that c and u are determined by v1 and v2, while Fig. 2b shows that c and u
impose constraints on v′
1 and
v′
2 have to fall on a spherical shell S of diameter u = |u| in the velocity space,
called the accessible shell herein. With help of this notion, two misconcepts
associated with (10) can be unveiled immediately. The ﬁrst is that after dv′
1
is speciﬁed, specifying dv′
2 in (10) is a work overdone. The second is that the
cross section should be deﬁned in reference to an area element on the accessible
shell rather than in reference to an arbitrary velocity volume element, expressed
by dv′
1 in the deﬁnition (10). If we insist on (10), the resultant ‘cross section’
can equal any value from zero to inﬁnity, depending on how dv′
1 encloses the
accessible shell and how dv′
1 approaches zero. To see it, we may imagine that
dv′
1 is a cylinder centered on and perpendicular to the accessible shell. When
dv′
1 becomes slimmer and slimmer, σ → 0; when dv′
1 becomes shorter and
shorter, σ → ∞[4].

Several issues are clariﬁed. Firstly, the Boltzmann theory bases itself on a
ﬁctitious time reversibility, and should be reconsidered. Secondly, in formulating
collisions in statistical mechanics, the constraints imposed by the accessible shell
must not be omitted. Finally, collisions between beams are inherently of time
irreversibility: if such collisions are correctly formulated in a theory, a certain
type of time irreversibility will be built into the theory naturally.

Now, we wish to give comments on physical mechanisms responsible for
time irreversibility. According to information theory, the increase of entropy

4

represents the destruction of information. For a classical gas, the information
contained in it is nothing but the aggregate of all initial conditions of all par-
ticles. Whenever and wherever such information is erased in a certain amount,
mechanisms of time irreversibility must be at work. Armed with this concept,
we realize that chaos theory, as well as some analyses concerning the implication
of ensemble average, indeed promises to account for time irreversibility to some
degree. Nevertheless, for purposes of this paper, we wish to bring attention
particularly to boundary eﬀects.

In view of that the ρ − S theorem is time reversible and the null boundary
condition related to it is just an assumption, it is arguable that time irreversibil-
ity may arise from realistic interaction between boundaries and particles.

Examine the situation in Fig. 3a, where a cuboid box with perfectly ﬂat walls
is stationary and all particles in it move with a deﬁnite speed v rightward or
leftward. To make the examination simpler, let all particles be rather small (or,
the gas be rather dilute) so that particle-to-particle collisions are negligible dur-
ing the time of concern. On this, we ﬁnd that, if particle-to-boundary collisions
are assumed to be perfectly elastic, the system will remain in the original state
for quite long; whereas, if realistic laws of particle-to-boundary collisions are
allowed to apply, the system will approach its equilibrium naturally. In Fig. 3b,
a particle colliding with the boundary loses its memory of initial condition, at
least partly, and spreads with various velocities according to a statistical law,
in which ﬂuctuation and dissipation must get involved[5]. By setting the tem-
perature T of the walls uniform and such that 3κT /2 = mv2/2, it is seen that
the gas entropy increases with no macroscopic energy exchange between the gas
and boundary.

collides with a wall.

The relevance of the boundary eﬀect can be veriﬁed in a quantitative way:
for a dilute gas in non-equilibrium, we may simulate the relaxation process with
help of empirical laws of particle-to-boundary collisions and compare the results
with those measured experimentally. (For instance, the relaxation time τ in this
consideration is almost unrelated to f while τ ∝ f −2 in the H-theorem.)

The above discussion also implies that after colliding with a boundary a
particle has to be treated as part of a particle beam since the consequent motion

5

of the particle can be known only in probability. As has been revealed, if a beam
formed by such particles meets with other particles, the new collisions can, in
turn, be considered as being of time irreversibility.

More investigations reveal more interesting things[6], of which one is that
realistic boundaries can not only erase information, but, in many cases, create
information. It is no wonder that so many striking phenomena in ﬂuid experi-
ments occur around boundaries.

Relativistic deﬁnition of the phase of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, involving two Lorentz invariants,
based on the Riemann-Silberstein vector is adopted to extend our previous study [I. Bialynicki-
Birula, Z. Bialynicka-Birula and C. ´Sliwa, Phys. Rev. A 61, 032110 (2000)] of the motion of vortex
lines embedded in the solutions of wave equations from Schr¨odinger wave mechanics to Maxwell
theory. It is shown that time evolution of vortex lines has universal features; in Maxwell theory
it is very similar to that in Schr¨odinger wave mechanics. Connection with some early work on
geometrodynamics is established. Simple examples of solutions of Maxwell equations with embedded
vortex lines are given. Vortex lines in Laguerre-Gaussian beams are treated in some detail.

INTRODUCTION

The physical signiﬁcance of the singularities of the phase of quantum mechanical wave functions has been recognized
by Dirac in his work on magnetic monopoles [1]. The hydrodynamic formulation of the Schr¨odinger theory discovered
by Madelung [2] provided a vivid interpretation of the lines in space where the phase is singular. These are simply
the vortex lines in the ﬂow of the probability ﬂuid. The velocity ﬁeld v(r, t) of this ﬂuid, deﬁned in terms of the
probability current j, is equal to the gradient of the phase S of the wave function ψ = R exp(iS/~),

~

Therefore, the ﬂow is strictly irrotational in the bulk; vorticity may live only on the lines of singularities of the phase.
ψ = 0 and
Regular wave functions may have a singular phase only where the wave function vanishes, i.e. where
ψ = 0. These two equations deﬁne two surfaces in space whose intersection determines the position of vortex lines.
ℑ
However, the vanishing of the wave function is the necessary but not the suﬃcient condition for the existence of vortex
lines. They exist only if the circulation around the line where the wave function vanishes is diﬀerent from zero. The
univaluedness of the wave function requires the quantization of the circulation

The importance of this condition in the hydrodynamic formulation of wave mechanics has been elucidated for the ﬁrst
time by Takabayasi [3]. If Eq. (2) holds for every closed contour, we may recover the phase S (modulo 2π~) from v
up to a global, constant phase with the help of the formula

Early studies of vortex lines were restricted to wave mechanics but Nye and Berry [4, 5, 6, 7] have shown that phase
singularities or wavefront dislocations play an important role not only in wave mechanics but in all wave theories. A
general review of phase singularities in wave ﬁelds has been recently given by Dennis [8, 9]. There is a substantial
overlap of concepts (but not of the results) between our work and the works of Berry, Nye and Dennis. While they

concentrate mostly on the stationary vortex lines that are found in monochromatic ﬁelds, we emphasize the time
evolution.

More recently, the study of phase singularities and vortices in optics has evolved into a separate area of research,

both theoretical and experimental, called singular optics. A recent review of this ﬁeld is given in Ref. [10].

In order to ﬁnd a natural generalization of Eq. (1), we need a replacement for the wave function ψ in electromag-
netism. A suitable object appears in the complex form of Maxwell equations known already to Riemann [11] and
investigated more closely by Silberstein [12] at the beginning of the last century. In this formulation the electric and
magnetic ﬁeld vectors are replaced by a single complex vector F that we proposed to call the Riemann-Silberstein
(RS) vector [13, 14]

Maxwell equations in free space written in terms of F read (c = 1)

F = (E + iB)/√2.

i∂tF =

∇ ×

F = 0.

F ,

∇ ·

The analogy between Eq. (5a) and the Schr¨odinger wave equation is so close that one is lead to treat F as the
photon wave function [14] and apply similar methods to analyze the vortex lines and their motion as we have done in
Refs. [15, 16] in nonrelativistic wave mechanics. There is, however, an important diﬀerence that requires an extension
of our previous methods: the RS vector has three components instead of one. Thus, there are three independent
phases ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3 — one for each component and it is not clear which combination of these phases should be treated
as an overall phase of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

In the case of the the Schr¨odinger wave function, the information about the phase S of the wave function is stored
in the velocity ﬁeld v = ∇S/m. Hence, one may try to ﬁnd the proper deﬁnition of the phase of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld by introducing ﬁrst the counterpart of Eq. (1) and then use the velocity ﬁeld to reconstruct the phase. The
natural generalization of the deﬁnition (1) is (in dimensionless form)

v =

1
2i P

k (F ∗k

∇Fk −

(∇F ∗k )Fk)

.

k F ∗k Fk

P

However, as has been noticed already by Takabayasi in his study of the hydrodynamic formulation of wave mechanics
of spinning particles [17], this generalization does not work. For a multicomponent ﬁeld the velocity deﬁned in this
way cannot be used to reconstruct the phase because, in general, ∇
v does not vanish. Even though one can still
give a hydrodynamic interpretation of Maxwell theory based on the formula (1), the simplicity of the scalar case is
completely lost [18].

×

In the present paper, the phase of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and the vortex lines associated with this phase are
deﬁned in terms of the square of the Riemann-Silberstein vector. Since F 2 is a sum of two electromagnetic invariants,
the structure of phase singularities associated with F 2 is relativistically invariant. This deﬁnition of the phase turns
out to be equivalent (provided F obeys Maxwell equations) to the one used in the classic papers on geometrodynamics
[20, 21, 22].

Despite the fact that F 2 does not obey any simple wave equation, the time evolution of the vortices exhibits all
the typical features found before by us for the Schr¨odinger equation. During the time evolution governed by Maxwell
equations vortex lines are created and annihilated at a point or in pairs and undergo vortex reconnections.

II. GEOMETRODYNAMICS AND THE PHASE OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD

In nonrelativistic wave mechanics the phase of the wave function can be obtained from its modulus provided
we also assume that the wave function obeys the Schr¨odinger equation. As a matter of fact it was shown by E.
Feenberg [19] that to determine the phase from the modulus it is suﬃcient that the wave function obeys some wave
equation that leads to conservation of the probability, i.e. to continuity equation. A similar reasoning applied to the
electromagnetic ﬁeld also enables one to determine the (properly deﬁned) phase of this ﬁeld. This discovery has been
made by Rainich [20] in connection with the problem of the reconstruction of the electromagnetic ﬁeld from purely
geometric quantities in general relativity. Independently, although much later, this problem was solved by Wheeler
and coworkers [21, 22, 23, 24] in the context of geometrodynamics.

Very brieﬂy, the reconstruction of the electromagnetic ﬁeld from geometry may be described as follows. The Einstein

equations

Rµν −

gµνR/2 = κTµν

(7)

enable one to determine the energy-momentum tensor Tµν of the electromagnetic ﬁeld from the Einstein tensor
gµνR/2 that is made of the metric tensor and its derivatives. However, the knowledge of the energy-momentum
Rµν −
tensor alone is not suﬃcient to determine completely the electromagnetic ﬁeld. This is best seen from the formulas
for the components of this tensor expressed in terms of the RS vector:

B′ = E sin ϕ + B cos ϕ.

−

All components of the energy-momentum tensor are invariant under the common change of the phase of all three
components of the RS vector — the duality transformation

Therefore, the overall phase cannot be determined from the energy-momentum tensor. Note, that in contrast to the
situation in quantum mechanics, even the global, constant phase of F has a direct physical meaning. It controls the
relative contribution to the energy-momentum tensor from the electric and the magnetic parts. The duality rotations
(9) with a constant value of ϕ leave the free Maxwell equations unchanged. However, a phase varying in space and/or
time would modify the Maxwell equations. That is the reason why the Rainich construction works. Namely, he
has shown that if one assumes that the electromagnetic ﬁeld obeys Maxwell equations, the phase of the ﬁeld may
be extracted from Tµν. For this purpose he introduced the following four-vector built from the components of the
energy-momentum tensor and its derivatives

wµ =

ǫµνλρTνκ∂λT κ
ρ
σ T σ
T τ

−

and used the line integral of wµ to reconstruct the phase.

Our proposal, how to deﬁne the phase of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is much simpler and yet it turns out to be
completely equivalent to the deﬁnition given by Rainich. We shall deﬁne the phase of the electromagnetic ﬁeld ϕ(x)
as half of the phase of the square of the RS vector

In full analogy with Eq. (1) of nonrelativistic wave mechanics, we deﬁne a “velocity” four-vector uµ as

Since F 2 is a complex sum of two electromagnetic invariants

uµ is a true relativistic four-vector

Since the RS vector is univalued, the phases obtained by choosing diﬀerent paths connecting the points x and x0
may diﬀer only by a multiple of 2π. In other words, the vorticity associated with uµ (or with wµ in the Rainich
construction) must be quantized

dξµuµ(ξ) = 2πn.

I

The phase deﬁned by Eq. (16) is determined up to a global phase ϕ0: the value of ϕ(x) at the lower limit x0 of the
integral. The value of ϕ0 cannot be obtained from the energy-momentum tensor.

Under duality rotations (9) when ϕ varies from 0 to 2π, the vector E′ at each spacetime point draws an ellipse
in the E
B plane. The same ellipse is drawn by the vector B′. These ellipses become circles on each vortex line
since then the vectors E and B are orthogonal and of equal length. This property lead Berry and Dennis [8] to name
the vortex lines associated with the square of a complex vector ﬁeld the C (circle) lines in their general classiﬁcation
scheme of phase singularities.

2 at a point also means that the electromagnetic ﬁeld at this point is pure radiation:
Therefore, the vanishing of
the energy density and the Poynting vector form a null four-vector. One may say that on vortex lines the energy of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld moves locally with the speed of light. We would like to emphasize that the velocity of the
energy ﬂow of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is not correlated with the vector uµ. Even the geometric properties of the

In this respect the situation is quite diﬀerent from nonrelativistic wave mechanics where the gradient of the phase
determines the velocity of the probability ﬂow.

III. SIMPLE EXAMPLES OF VORTEX LINES

The analogy between the phase of wave function and the phase of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is not exact. Unlike
the Schr¨odinger wave function, the electromagnetic ﬁeld does not have to vanish identically along the lines where the
vanish. Still, we believe
phase is singular. It is only necessary that the ﬁeld is null i.e. the two invariants
that the lines along which the ﬁeld is null deserve the name of vortex lines.

The time evolution of the vortex lines embedded in the solutions of the Maxwell equations is quite similar to the
evolution of such lines embedded in the solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation. The simplest examples of solutions with
vortex lines can again be found among the polynomial functions. Such functions may be viewed as long wavelength
expansions and were found to be very useful in the study of vortex solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation [15, 16] and
the Helmholtz equation [4, 25]. Alternatively, these polynomial solutions may be viewed as local approximations to
the full solution, valid close to the vortex lines under study. In this case one may imagine that in the exact solution
the polynomial is multiplied by some slowly varying envelope that makes the full solution localized. We shall give at
the end of this Section an example of such a solution.

As an illustration of a typical behavior of electromagnetic vortex lines, we present very simple examples of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld. The following four ﬁelds satisfy the Maxwell equations and possess the vortex structures very
similar to those found in Schr¨odinger wave mechanics [15, 16]

The rate of change of the radius exceeds (by a factor of √3) the speed of light showing once again that various
characteristic features of relativistic ﬁelds (like their zeros or maxima) may travel with superluminal speeds without
violating causality. In this simple example, no change of the topology of vortex line takes place. However, in the three
remaining cases the topology changes according to the same universal patterns as those found in Schr¨odinger wave
mechanics. This universal behaviour of vortex lines is reminiscent of the catastrophe theory [27, 28].

just one simple example of such a solution constructed from the following localized solution of the wave equation

IV. VORTEX LINES IN SUPERPOSITIONS OF PLANE WAVES AND IN GAUSSIAN BEAMS

Solutions of Maxwell equations exhibiting vortex structures may also be obtained with the use of standard building
blocks — the monochromatic plane waves. A single plane wave is described by a null ﬁeld since both invariants vanish.

Therefore, the velocity (14) vanishes — a single plane wave has no vortex structure. Also, the sum of two plane waves
does not have any vortex structure; even though it has a nonvanishing velocity ﬁeld. However, for three plane waves
we may have various kinds of vortex structures. As an example, we choose three circularly polarized monochromatic
waves of the same frequency, handedness, and amplitude, moving in three mutually orthogonal directions. The RS

The most interesting case, of course, is a superposition not of a few but of a continuum of plane waves, forming
a collimated beam. We shall concentrate on the Laguerre-Gaussian beams, in view of their applicability to realistic
situations (cf., for example [30]). We use the representation of these beams in the vector theory as in Refs.[31, 32,
33, 34] but we combine the electric and the magnetic ﬁeld vectors into the complex RS vector (4). This vector for
Laguerre-Gaussian beams of circular polarization can be written in the form

The square of the this vector is equal to

F (x, y, z, t) = e−

i(ωt

Note, that the vector F given by Eq. (33) is not just the analytic signal but the full RS vector as deﬁned by Eq. (4)
whose real part is the electric ﬁeld and the imaginary part is the magnetic induction. The slowly varying complex
envelope function u = u(x, y, z) is an arbitrary linear superposition of the functions unm(ρ, φ, z) deﬁned as (we use
the notation of Ref. [34])

The velocity (12) can be obtained by diﬀerentiating the phase of the function (∂x + i∂y)u but the expression is quite
cumbersome. However, it is clear from Eq. (37) that the function (∂x + i∂y)u for positive and for negative values of
m carries m + 1 units of angular momentum in the z direction. Vortex lines deﬁned in terms of the RS vector run
along the z axis and their vorticity has the strength m + 1. At ﬁrst, these results seem to be in disagreement with
the detailed analysis of angular momentum of Laguerre-Gauss beams by Allen, Padget, and Babiker given in Ref. [33]
since they have shown that the additional unit of angular momentum is to be added to m or subtracted from m
depending on the (right or left) polarization of the beam. However, we have broken this symmetry by considering the
RS vector F and not its complex conjugate. This (arbitrary) choice has ﬁxed the (positive) sign of the polarization.
With this proviso, our deﬁnition of vortex lines in terms of the RS vector leads to the same results as the analysis
of angular momentum. Each component unm has only one vortex line associated with the total angular momentum.
However, superpositions of several unm components, depending on their composition, may have additional vortex
lines.

The presence of vortex lines in Laguerre-Gaussian beams is due to the deﬁnite angular momentum in the direction
of propagation. The same vortex lines appear also in electromagnetic multipole ﬁelds. In this case the RS vector can
be written in the form [35]

For the dipole ﬁeld (J = 1, M = 1)

F (x, y, z, t) = e−

Thus, the dipole ﬁeld for M = 1 exhibits one vortex line along the z-axis (the direction of the angular momentum
quantization) with unit vorticity. Higher multipoles will exhibit vortex lines carrying more units of vorticity, depending
on the value of the z component of the angular momentum.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The study presented in this paper fully uniﬁes the description of vortex lines in electromagnetism and in Schr¨odinger
wave mechanics.
In both cases there is a single complex function of space and time whose phase generically has
singularities along one-dimensional curves in three-dimensional space — the vortex lines. The velocity four-vector uµ
associated with the phase of the electromagnetic ﬁeld plays the same role as the velocity v of the probability ﬂuid
in wave mechanics. The circulation around each vortex line is quantized in units of 2π. There are two important
diﬀerences. First, the gradient of the electromagnetic phase does not have any obvious dynamical interpretation.
Second, the electromagnetic ﬁeld does not vanish identically on vortex lines but only the two relativistic invariants
vanish and the energy-momentum becomes locally a null four-vector.

Finally, we would like to mention that in principle one should be able to construct a hydrodynamic form of
electrodynamics, analogous to the Madelung formulation of wave mechanics. The set of hydrodynamic variables for
the electromagnetic ﬁeld would comprise the components of the energy-momentum tensor (only ﬁve of them are
independent, cf., for example [18]) and the velocity vector uµ that carries the information about the phase of the
RS vector. The quantization condition (17) eﬀectively reduces the information contained in uµ to just one scalar
function giving ﬁnally six independent functions. However, we have not found a simple set of equations for these
hydrodynamic-like variables that would be equivalent to Maxwell theory.

We would like to thank Mark Dennis for very fruitful comments and for making his PhD Thesis available to us.

Abstract

The equivalent circuit model for artiﬁcial magnetic materials based on various arrange-
ments of split rings is generalized by taking into account losses in the substrate or matrix mate-
rial. It is shown that a modiﬁcation is needed to the known macroscopic permeability function
in order to correctly describe these materials. Depending on the dominating loss mechanism
(conductive losses in metal parts or dielectric losses in the substrate) the permeability function
has diﬀerent forms. Furthermore, an explicit expression is derived for the electromagnetic ﬁeld
energy density in the material. This expression is valid at low frequencies and in the vicinity of
the resonance also when dispersion and losses in the material are strong. Microstrip antennas
loaded with artiﬁcial magneto-dielectric substrates are introduced as an example of practical
applications beneﬁting from the present results.

1 Introduction

Artiﬁcial media with extraordinary properties (often called metamaterials) attract increasing
attention in the microwave community. Microwave devices and antennas are considered as very
prospective applications to beneﬁt from these new materials. For instance, several interesting
ideas have recently been proposed in the ﬁeld of small antennas: the radiation properties of small
wire antennas surrounded by artiﬁcial materials have been considered e.g. in [1, 2], materials
with negative parameters [backward-wave materials or double-negative materials (DNG)] have
been proposed for patch antenna miniaturization [3, 4], and the radar cross section manipulation
of patch antennas with DNG or single-negative materials has been considered in [5]. After the
seminal work of Hansen and Burke [6] magneto-dielectric substrates have been considered as
one of the most promising ways to miniaturize microstrip antennas [7]–[12].

The split-ring resonator was introduced as an artiﬁcial magnetic particle already in the
50’s [13]; recently, a lot of work has been devoted to artiﬁcial magnetic materials operating in
the microwave regime, e.g. [14]–[20]. The feature that one would like to achieve with magneto-
dielectric substrates in antenna miniaturization is Re
as high as possible over the matching
{
band of the antenna. In practise, this condition can be achieved only by choosing the oper-
ational frequency of the loaded antenna close to the resonance of the inclusions. When the
operational frequency of the loaded antenna is well below the substrate resonance, the sub-
strate is usually considered as a nearly dispersion-free paramagnetic load. However, even weak
frequency dispersion of the substrate has a noticeable impact on the impedance bandwidth
properties of the antenna [12]. Split-rings used in the design of double-negative materials also
operate near the particle resonance.

}

Accurate models of artiﬁcial magnetic materials that take into account frequency dispersion
and various loss mechanisms are necessary for understanding potential applications in antennas
and microwave engineering. For example, in antenna engineering we often need to estimate
the radiation quality factor Qr, which is the proper measure when comparing the impedance
bandwidth properties of two antennas having the same volume and operating at the same
frequency. To deﬁne Qr of an antenna one needs to determine the stored electromagnetic energy
in the near ﬁelds of the antenna. In the case when the antenna lies on top of a complex substrate
obeying strong dispersion and loss, e.g. on top of an artiﬁcial magneto-dielectric substrate, this
determination is far from trivial. A common procedure to determine the stored energy is to
integrate the electromagnetic ﬁeld energy density over the volume of the resonator. However,
the classical expression for the energy density [21, 22] is applicable only when absorption due
to losses can be neglected. If losses in the material cannot be neglected near the frequency
of interest, it is not possible to express the energy density in terms of material permittivity
and permeability functions [21]. One has to have knowledge about the microstructure of the
material.

In the literature, the eﬀective permeability of various split-ring structures is usually esti-
mated neglecting the losses in dielectric substrates or dielectric matrices. It is normally assumed
that the properties of the dielectric substrate can be modeled by the eﬀective permittivity of the
composite (metal rings also contribute to the permittivity). Even if the losses in the dielectric
fraction are included in the analysis, it is assumed that the permeability function always has the
modiﬁed Lorentzian form for all possible loss mechanisms. In this paper we consider artiﬁcial
magneto-dielectric materials based on split rings and generalize the known equivalent circuit

model [23] by taking into account losses in the dielectric matrix material along with losses in
metal rings. We show that a modiﬁcation is needed to the macroscopic permeability function
commonly used to model these materials in the quasi-static regime. We derive an expression
for the electromagnetic ﬁeld energy density, which is valid also when losses in metal parts and
(or) the dielectric substrate cannot be neglected.

2 Microscopic circuit model and macroscopic permeabil-

ity function

A commonly accepted permeability model as an eﬀective medium description of dense (in terms
of the wavelength) arrays of split-ring resonators and other similar structures reads

µ(ω) = µ0µr(ω) = µ0

1 +

Aω2
ω2 + jωΓ (cid:19)

(cid:18)

ω2
0 −

(1)

→ ∞

(see e.g. [15, 18, 20].) Above, A is the amplitude factor (0 < A < 1), ω0 is the undamped
angular frequency of the zeroth pole pair (the resonant frequency of the array), and Γ is the
loss factor. The model is obviously applicable only in the quasi-static regime since in the limit
ω
the permeability does not tend to µ0. At extremely high frequencies materials can
not be polarized due to inertia of electrons, thus, a physically sound high frequency limit is µ0
[21]. However, (1) gives correct results at low frequencies and in the vicinity of the resonance.
This is the typical frequency range of interest e.g. when utilizing artiﬁcial magneto-dielectric
substrates in antenna miniaturization [8, 11, 12]. In the vicinity of the magnetic resonance the
eﬀective permittivity of a dense array of split-ring resonators is weakly dispersive, and can be
assumed to be constant.

The classical expression for the electromagnetic energy density of ﬁelds whose spectrum is

concentrated near a certain angular frequency ωres reads [21, 22]

If losses in the material cannot be neglected near the frequency of interest, it is not possible
to express the energy density in terms of material permittivity and permeability functions [21,
23]. This is a common situation in antenna miniaturization with artiﬁcial magneto-dielectric
substrates, since the eﬀective magnetism typically vanishes rapidly as the frequency deviates
from the particle resonance.

In [23] the energy density in dispersive and lossy magnetic materials was introduced via a
thought experiment: A small (in terms of the wavelength or the decay length in the material)
sample of a magnetic material [described by (1)] was positioned in the magnetic ﬁeld created
by a tightly wounded long solenoid having inductance L0, Fig. 1a. The insertion changes the
impedance of the solenoid to

Z(ω) = jωL0µr(ω) = jωL0 +

The aforementioned equivalent circuit model is correct from the microscopic point of view since
the modeled material is a collection of capacitively loaded loops magnetically coupled to the
incident magnetic ﬁeld. An important assumption in [23] and in the present paper is that
the current distribution is nearly uniform over the loop. This means that the electric dipole
moment created by the exciting ﬁeld is negligible as compared to the magnetic moment. The
electromagnetic ﬁeld energy density in the material was found to be [23]

In [23] only losses due to nonideally conducting metal of loops were taken into account,
and losses in the matrix material (substrate material on which metal loops are printed) were
neglected.

2.1 Eﬀective permeability

Let us generalize the expression for the energy density (6) in artiﬁcial magnetics by including
the losses of the matrix material into the analysis. Losses in the matrix material (typically a
lossy dielectric laminate) can be modeled by an additional resistor in parallel with the capacitor.
Indeed, if a capacitor is ﬁlled with a lossy dielectric material, the admittance reads

where the latter expression denotes a loss conductance. Thus, the microscopically correct
equivalent circuit model is that shown in Fig. 2b. The impedance seen by the source can be

Comparing (1) and (9) we immediately notice that (1) is an insuﬃcient macroscopic model

Above we have denoted ω0 = 1/(LC). The macroscopic permeability function of diﬀerent
artiﬁcial magnetic materials can be conveniently estimated using (10), as several results are
known in the literature for the eﬀective circuit parameter values for diﬀerent unit cells, e.g. [15,
18, 20].

For the use of (10) it is important to know the physical nature of the equivalent loss resistor
Rd. If losses in the matrix material are due to ﬁnite conductivity of the dielectric material, the
complex permittivity reads

ǫ = ǫ′

jǫ′′ = ǫ′

where σ is the conductivity of the matrix material. Thus, we see from (7) that the loss resistor
is independent from the frequency and can be interpreted as a “true” resistor. Moreover, in
this case the permeability function is that given by (10). However, depending on the nature
of the dielectric material the loss mechanism can be far from (12), and in other situations the
macroscopic permeability function needs other modiﬁcations. For example, let us assume that
the permittivity obeys the Lorentzian type dispersion law

2.2 An example of the eﬀect of dielectric loss terms on the eﬀective

permeability

We assume here that an artiﬁcial magneto-dielectric substrate is implemented as an array of
metasolenoids [20], and estimate the amplitudes of the correction terms [B, (1 + R/Rd), Γd].
The array is designed to resonate at 3 GHz, and the metasolenoids have the following structural
4 mm2, the strip width w = 0.25
parameters, see Fig. 3: the cross section area S = a
mm, the width of the split in the rings g = 1.0 mm, the separation between the rings d = 0.51
mm, and the volume ﬁlling ratio Vr = 1. The rings are embedded in a Rogers RT/duroid
host substrate having ǫ = 2.33(1
j0.001)ǫ0. The structural parameters correspond closely
to practical values which have been used to implement these substrates [12]. Using formulas
presented in [20], the capacitance and the inductance are equal to

The resistor R due to ohmic losses is typically a fraction of an Ohm, in this example R = 0.23 Ω.
Thus, we notice that the shift in the resonant frequency in this particular case is negligible. We

Here we note that in this particular case the dielectric loss term Γd dominates over Γ. This
is a very signiﬁcant result since typically only the ohmic losses are taken into account when
macroscopically modeling permeability of artiﬁcial magnetics. An estimate for the relation

We have used A = 0.2 and plotted the permeability function given by (10) and (1) (“proposed
model” and ”lossless matrix”, respectively) using the values introduced above. The result is
presented in Fig. 4. The result shows that neglecting the loss resistance due to dielectric matrix
losses leads to a strong overestimation of the achievable permeability values.

3 Electromagnetic ﬁeld energy density

Following the approach introduced in [2, 23] we will next generalize the expression for the
energy density in artiﬁcial magnetics.

The inductance per unit length of a tightly wound long solenoid is L0 = µ0n2S, where n is

where µ(ω) has been expressed through (1) (magnetic losses have been neglected). We notice
that the energy densities given by (24) and (6) give practically the same result over the whole
studied frequency range. This is due to the fact that large values of ω and ω0 mask the eﬀect
of Γ and Γd in (24) and (2). There is, however, a visible diﬀerence between the results given by
(24) and (25): just below the resonance the loss contribution to the energy density is noticeable.
Moreover, for ω > √3ω0 the energy density given by (25) is smaller than the energy stored in
vacuum. As has been mentioned in [23], the reason is the failure of the quasi-static permeability
model (1) at high frequencies. It is clear that formula (24) should be used even in the case of
small losses.

4 Application to microstrip antenna miniaturization

Microstrip antenna miniaturization using artiﬁcial magneto-dielectric substrates has gained a
lot of interest recently [7]–[12]. For the calculation of the stored electromagnetic energy in
the near ﬁelds of the loaded antenna the contribution of the substrate plays an important
role. Especially, if the loaded antenna operates in the vicinity of the substrate resonance, the
stored energy must be calculated utilizing the microscopic model for the substrate. Here we
present a circuit model for the loaded antenna operating near its fundamental resonance. This
circuit representation and the above derived expressions for the ﬁeld energy density allow us to
calculate the stored energy and the radiation quality factor when losses in the substrate have
a signiﬁcant contribution.

Let us consider a resonant patch antenna lying on top of a non-resonant ground plane and
load the volume under the antenna patch with an artiﬁcial magneto-dielectric slab characterized
If the substrate ﬁlls the volume under the antenna element uniformly, the current
by (10).
and voltage distribution on the patch do not change. Moreover, in the quasi-static regime the
magnetic ﬂux created by the current ﬂowing in the antenna element and in the ground plane can
be considered rather uniform. In a practical situation, an array of metasolenoids, for example,
should be positioned so that the magnetic ﬂux created by the ﬂowing current penetrates the
rings. In the quasi-static regime the conﬁguration is very similar to the situation of Fig. 2a.
The equivalent circuit model for the loaded antenna in the vicinity of the antenna resonance is
obviously of the form shown in Fig. 6, where Gr is the radiation conductance and C = C0ǫr. ǫr

Figure 6: Equivalent circuit model for a patch antenna loaded with an artiﬁcial magneto-

is the eﬀective permittivity of the substrate, which is assumed to be dispersion-free.

Typically the substrate does not contribute to radiation, thus, the radiation quality factor

can be calculated directly based on the above derived circuit model:

Qr =

ω(W patch + W substrate)
Pr

,

(26)

(27)

(28)

where W patch is the energy stored in the parallel circuit representing the antenna element,
W substrate is the energy stored in the substrate, and Pr = Gr
2 is the radiated power. Using
the formulas presented in Section 3 the radiation quality factor can be derived in the following
form:

Expression (27) is general, however, it does not readily tell how the radiation quality factor
depends, for example, on the substrate dimensions. To utilize (27) one has to ﬁrst estimate the
values for the eﬀective circuit parameters and solve the angular resonant frequency from (28).
Another way to ﬁnd the stored energy, and further Qr, is to integrate the expression for the
electromagnetic ﬁeld energy density over the volume of the antenna. As an example, consider
a loaded λ/2-patch antenna having length l, width w, and height h. Moreover, we assume
that eﬀective substrate permittivity ǫ = ǫrǫ0 has low losses and negligible dispersion. For this
particular case we ﬁnd the radiation quality factor as

dispersion characteristics of the substrate are known, and it allows one to take into account
magnetic losses. When deriving (29) the assumption is that the losses do not change the stand-
ing wave pattern in the antenna element at the resonance, which is a valid assumption for
moderate losses.

Conclusion

In this paper we have generalized the eﬀective permeability model and the equivalent circuit
model for magneto-dielectric substrates based on various split-ring structures. The generalized
model of permeability takes into account losses in the dielectric matrix material as well as losses
in metal rings. It has been shown that a modiﬁcation is needed to the macroscopic permeabil-
ity function commonly used to model these materials in the quasi-static regime. Moreover,
depending on the nature of the dominating loss mechanism in the matrix material the perme-
ability function has diﬀerent forms. Expression for the electromagnetic ﬁeld energy density in
the material has been derived. This expression is valid also when losses in the material can not
be neglected and when the medium is strongly dispersive. The proposed results are especially
applicable when evaluating the impedance bandwidth properties of microstrip antennas loaded
with artiﬁcial magneto-dielectrics substrates, and in the design of artiﬁcial media with negative
parameters.

Abstract

Several new ideas related to Special and General Relativity
are proposed. The black-box method is used for the synchro-
nization of the clocks and the space axes between two iner-
tial systems or two accelerated systems and for the derivation
of the transformations between them. There are two consis-
tent ways of deﬁning the inputs and outputs to describe the
transformations and relative motion between the systems. The
standard approach uses a mixture of the two ways. By formu-
lating the principle of special and general relativity as a sym-
metry principle we are able to specify these transformations
to depend only on a constant.

The transformations become Galilean if the constant is
zero. Validity of the Clock Hypothesis for uniformly acceler-
ated systems implies zero constant. If the constant is not zero,
we can introduce a metric under which the transformations be-
come self adjoint. In case of inertial systems, the metric is the
Minkowski metric and we obtain a unique invariant maximal
velocity. The ball of the relativistically admissible velocities
is a bounded symmetric domain under projective maps. For
uniformly accelerated systems the existence of an invariant
maximal acceleration is predicted. This is the only method
of describing transformations between uniformly accelerated
systems without assuming the Clock Hypothesis.

1 Introduction

In this article we present the ﬁrst steps of a program for a unifying
language for physics based on the the theory of bounded symmetric
domains. Most results presented here can be found with details in [7]
and [9].

In this article we will derive the transformations between inertial
and uniformly accelerated systems based only on the principles of
special and general relativity, respectively, and the symmetry implied
by them. We use the black-box method for the synchronization of
the clocks and the space axes between the two systems and for the
derivation of the transformations between them. We will use two
consistent ways of deﬁning the inputs and outputs for description
of the the transformations and relative motion between the systems.
In each way we will specify the form of the transformation and the
meaning of its components. By formulating the principles of special
and general relativity as symmetry principles we are able to explicitly
specify these transformations (with dependence only on a constant).
The transformations become Galilean if the above constant is zero.
Validity of the Clock Hypothesis implies that the constant is zero for
uniformly accelerated systems. If the constant is not zero, in case
of inertial systems we obtain a unique invariant maximal velocity
and for uniformly accelerated systems the existence of an invariant
maximal acceleration is predicted.

In forthcoming Part 2 we will discuss new ideas of relativistic evo-
lution and its connection with the invariance of the ball of relativisti-
cally admissible velocities or accelerations. Such evolution is deﬁned
by the Lie algebra for the automorphism groups of these balls and
via a new Equivalence Principle. We will explain how a new dynamic
variable, which is related to the spinors, helps to solve relativistic
dynamic equations.

2 Transformations between inertial sys-
tems based on the principle of relativ-
ity

In this section, we derive the space-time transformation between
two inertial systems, using only the isotropy of space and symme-
try, which follow from the principle of relativity. The transformation
will be deﬁned uniquely except for a constant e, which depends only
on the process of synchronization of clocks inside each system.

We begin with two inertial systems. Typically, there are events
which are observable from both systems. We will assume that each
system has a way of deﬁning space and time parameters describing

1

an observed event.

Newton’s First Law states that an object moves with constant
velocity in an inertial system if there are no forces acting on it or if
the sum of all forces on it is zero. Such a motion is called free motion
and is described by straight lines in the space-time continuum. Free
motion in one inertial system will be observed as free motion in any
inertial system. This means that the space-time transformations will
map lines to lines. Thus, if we chose space and time as the parameters
with which to describe events in the inertial systems and common
space axes at time t = 0, the space-time transformation will be a
linear transformation.

An event observed by two inertial systems can be considered as a
“two-port linear black box”. Each side of the box correspond to an
inertial system. One port on each side deﬁnes the time of the event,
while the second one deﬁnes the space coordinates of the event. The
observation of the event by each system provides information on the
transformation between these systems. Since our intuition does not
work well in a dynamically varying environment and in cases of ex-
tremely high velocities, the black box approach is preferable to the
approach which assumes a priori some properties of the transforma-
tion.

2.1

Identiﬁcation of symmetry inherent in the

principle of special relativity

Albert Einstein formulated the principle of special relativity ([5],
p.25): “If K is an inertial system, then every other system K ′ which
moves uniformly and without rotation relatively to K, is also an in-
ertial system; the laws of nature are in concordance for all inertial
systems.” By the principle of special relativity, the space-time trans-
formation between the systems will depend only on the choice of the
space axes, the measuring devices (consisting of rods and clocks) and
the relative motion between these systems.

The relative motion between two inertial systems is described by
their relative velocity. We denote by b the relative velocity (called
the boost) of K ′ with respect to K and by b′ the relative velocity
of K with respect to K ′. If we choose the measuring devices in each
system to be the same and choose the axes in such a way that the
coordinates of b are equal to the coordinates of b′, then the space-
time transformation S from K to K ′ will be equal to the space-
time transformation S′ from K ′ to K. Since, in general, S′ = S−1,
in this case we will have S2 = I. Such an operator S is called a
symmetry. Thus, the principle of special relativity implies that with
an appropriate choice of axes and measuring devices, the space-time
transformation S between two inertial systems is a symmetry.

2

2.2 Synchronization of the clocks and the space

axes in two inertial systems.

As mentioned above, in order for the space-time transformation to be
a symmetry we have to choose the measuring devices in each system
to be the same and choose the axes in such a way that the coordinates
of b are equal to the coordinates of b′. To do this, we will synchronize
the two systems by observing events from each system and comparing
the results. System 1 begins with the following conﬁguration. There
is a set of three mutually orthogonal space axes and a system of rods.
In this way, each point in space is associated with a unique vector
in R3. In addition, there is a clock at each point in space, and all
of the clocks are synchronized to each other by some synchronization
procedure. System 2 has the same setup, only we do not assume that
the rods of system 1 are identical to the rods of system 2, nor do we
assume that the clock synchronization procedure in system 2 is the
same as that of system 1.

First, we synchronize the origins of the frames. Produce an event
E0 at the origin O of system 1 at time t = 0 on the clock positioned
in system 1 at O. This event is observed at some point O′ in system
2, and the system 2 clock at O′ shows some value t′ = t′
0. Translate
the origin of system 2 to the point O′ (without rotating). Subtract t′
0
from the system 2 clock at O′. Synchronize all of the system 2 clocks
to this clock. This completes the synchronization of the origins.

Next, we will adjust the x-axis of each system. Since the systems
are varying dynamically, any adjustment in a system could be done
only by use of objects which are static in this system. Note that
system 2 is moving with some (perhaps unknown) constant velocity
b with respect to system 1 and that the origin O′ of system 2 was at
the point O of system 1 at time t = 0. Therefore, the point O′ will
always be on the static line bt in system 1. Rotate the axes in system
1 so that the new negative x-axis coincides with the ray
.
}
Similarly, system 1 is moving with some constant velocity b′ with
respect to system 2, and the origin O of system 1 was at the point
O′ of system 2 at time t′ = 0. Therefore, the point O will always
be on the line b′t in system 2. Rotate the axes in system 2 so that
the new negative x′-axis coincides with the ray
. The
two x-axes now coincide as lines and point in opposite directions.
We are ﬁnished manipulating the axes and clocks of system 1 and
will henceforth refer to system 1 as the inertial frame K. However,
it still remains to manipulate system 2, as we must adjust the y′-
and z′-axes of system 2 to be parallel and oppositely oriented to the
corresponding axes of K.

b′t : t > 0

bt : t > 0

{

}

{

To adjust the y′-axis of system 2, produce an event E1 at the
point r = (0, 1, 0) of K. This event is observed in system 2 at some
point r′. Rotate the space axes of system 2 around the x′-axis so that

3

r′ will lie in the new x′-y′ plane and have a negative y′ coordinate
y′
1. Change the space scale to make this new coordinate y′
1 equal -1.
After this rotation, the z-axis of K and the z′-axis of system 2 will be
parallel. We need to make sure that they have opposite orientations.
Produce an event E2 at the point r = (0, 0, 1) of K. This event is
observed in system 2 at some point r′.
If the z′ coordinate of r′
is positive, reverse the direction of the z′-axis. This completes the
adjustment of the space axes of the two systems. See Figure 1.

of b in K are equal to the coordinates (in K ′) of the relative velocity
of the system K with respect to K ′.

We will call such a frame a symmetric frame. Finally, change the
scale of the time in system 2 to make the relative velocity of K with
respect to K ′ be equal to b, the relative velocity of K ′ with respect
to K.

2.3 Choice of inputs and outputs

There are two ways to deﬁne the inputs and outputs for such a trans-
formation.

2.3.1 Cascade connection

The ﬁrst one, called the cascade connection, takes time and space of

one of the systems, say

of K ′, as input, and gives time and

t′
r′

(cid:19)
space of the second system, say

(cid:18)

t
r

of K, as output (see Figure

(cid:18)
2). Note that we use a circle instead of the usual box to represent
a black-box. This is done in order that the connection between any
two ports will be displayed inside the box (see Figure 3).

(cid:19)

4

Figure 2: The cascade connection for space-time transformations.
The circle represents a black box. One side has two input ports:
the time t′ and the space r′ coordinates of an event in system K ′.
The other side has two output ports: the time t and the space r
coordinates of the same event in system K. The linear operators
Eij represent the functional connections between the corresponding
ports.

The cascade connection is the one usually used in special relativ-

ity.

We represent the linear transformation induced by the cascade
4 matrix E, which we decompose into four block

connection by a 4
matrix components Eij , as follows:

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

(cid:19) (cid:18)

(cid:18)
To understand the meaning of the blocks, assume that the system K ′
is an airplane. Let t′ be the time between two events (say crossing two
lighthouses) measured by a clock at rest at r′ = 0 on the airplane. The
time diﬀerence t of the same two events measured by synchronized
clocks at the two lighthouses (in system K, the earth) will be equal
to t = E11t′. If we denote the distance between the lighthouses by
r, then r = E21t′, and E21 is the so-called proper velocity of the
plane. Generally, the proper velocity u of an object (the airplane)
in an inertial system is the ratio of the space displacement dr in lab
system (the earth) divided by the time interval, called the proper
time interval dτ , measured by the clock moving with the object (on
the plane). Thus,

2.3.2 Hybrid connection

The second type of connection, called the hybrid connection, uses
time of one of the systems, say t of K, and the space coordinates

r′ of the second system K ′, as input, and gives

as output

(see Figure 3). Usually we use relative velocity (not relative proper

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

Figure 3: The hybrid connection for space-time transformations. The
circle represents a black box. The two input ports are the time t of
an event, as measured in system K, and its space coordinates r′, as
measured in system K ′. The two output ports are the time t′ of
the same event, calculated in system K ′, and its space r coordinates,
calculated in K. The linear operators Sij represent the functional
connections between the corresponding ports. For instance, to deﬁne
the map S21, we consider an event that occurs at O′, corresponding
to input r′ = 0, at time t in K. Then S21t represent the space
displacement of O′ in K during time t, which is, by the deﬁnition,
the relative velocity b of system K ′ with respect to system K.

velocity) to describe the relative position between inertial systems.
To deﬁne the relative position of system K ′ with respect to K, we
consider an event that occurs at O′, corresponding to r′ = 0, at time
t, and express its position r in K. If we denote by b the uniform
velocity of system K ′ with respect to K, then

r = bt.

(3)

Note our use of the hybrid connection. In this section we will use
the hybrid connection in order to keep the relative velocity as the
description of relative position between the systems. Furthermore,
a bounded symmetric domain is obtained only for the velocities and
not for the proper velocities.

We denote by Sb the space-time transformation, using the hybrid
connection, for two inertial systems with relative velocity b between

6

them. Thus, for the transformation Sb, we choose the inputs to be the
scalar t, the time of the event in K, and the three-dimensional vector
r′ describing the position of the event in K ′. Then our outputs are
the scalar t′, the time of the event in K ′, and the three-dimensional
vector r describing the position of the event in K. As above with
respect to the cascade connection, here we also decompose the 4

matrix Sb into block components:

.

(cid:19)

(cid:19) (cid:18)

(4)

(see Figure 3).

We explain now the meaning of the four linear maps Sij. To
deﬁne the maps S21 and S11, consider an event that occurs at O′,
corresponding to r′ = 0, at time t in K. Then S21(t) expresses the
position of this event in K, and S11(t) expresses the time of this
event in K ′. Obviously, S21 describes the relative velocity of K ′ with
respect to K, and

S21(t) = bt,
(5)
while S11(t) is the time shown by the clock positioned at O′ of an
event occurring at O′ at time t in K and is given by

S11(t) = αt

(6)

for some constant α.

To deﬁne the maps S12 and S22, we will consider an event oc-
curring at time t = 0 in K in space position r′ in K ′. Then S12(r′)
will be the time of this event in K ′, and S22(r′) will be the position
of this event in K. Note that S12(r′) is also the time diﬀerence of
two clocks, both positioned at time t = 0 at r′ in K ′, where the ﬁrst
one was synchronized to the clock at the common origin of the two
systems within the frame K ′, and the second one was synchronized
to the clock at the origin within the frame K. Thus S12 describes
the non-simultaneity in K ′ of simultaneous events in K with respect
to their space displacement in K ′, following from the diﬀerence in
synchronization of clocks in K and K ′. Since S12 is a linear map
from R3 to R, it is given by:

S12(r′) = eT r′,

R3, where eT denotes the transpose of e. Note
for some vector e
that eT r′ is the dot product of e and r′. See Figure 4 for the connec-
tion between the time of events in two inertial systems.

∈

Finally, the map S22 describes the transformation of the space
displacement in K of simultaneous events in K with respect to their
space displacement in K ′, and it is given by

S22(r′) = Ar′

rates of clocks (time slowdown) in each system and by the diﬀerent
synchronization of the clocks positioned at diﬀerent space points.

Note that the usual approach uses the cascade connection for
the space-time transformation and the relative velocity, which comes
from the hybrid connection, for the description of the relative motion
between the systems. However, space contraction, time contraction
and the measure of non-simultaneity are deﬁned by use of the hybrid
connection.

2.3.3 The transformation between cascade and hybrid con-

nections

Note that the matrices E and Sb describing the space-time transfor-
mations between two inertial systems using the cascade and hybrid
connections, respectively, are related by some transformation Ψ. The

Identiﬁcation of invariants

In this section we will show that if the transformations are not Galilean,
the principle of relativity alone implies that an interval is conserved
and that all velocities are limited by some universal velocity. To
show this, we introduce an appropriate metric on the space-time un-
der which the symmetry Sb becomes an isometry and a self-adjoint
operator. It is known that Sb is self-adjoint with respect to some
inner product if and only if the eigenvectors of this operator which
correspond to diﬀerent eigenvalues are orthogonal to each other.

Any symmetry is a reﬂection with respect to the set of ﬁxed points.
Direct veriﬁcation shows that the events ﬁxed by the transformation
Sb lie on a straight world-line through the origin of both frames at
time t = 0, moving with velocity w1 (the 1 eigenvector of Sb) deﬁned
by

w1 :=

b
α + 1

,

(22)

where α is deﬁned by (16). The velocity w1 is called the symmetric
velocity between the systems K and K ′. The symmetric velocity
has the following physical interpretation. Place two objects of equal
mass (test masses) at the origins of each inertial system. The center
of mass of the two objects will be called the center of the two inertial
systems. The symmetric velocity is the velocity of each system with
respect to the center of the systems.

In particular, the transformation Sb maps zero interval world-lines
to zero interval world-lines. Since zero interval world-lines correspond
to uniform motion with unique speed µ, for any relativistic space-time
transformation between two inertial systems with e > 0, there is a
speed µ deﬁned by (26) which is conserved. Obviously, the cone
ds2 > 0, corresponding to the positive Lorentz cone, is also preserved
under this transformation.

It can be shown that e is independent of the relative velocity b

between the frames K and K ′.

Several experiments at end of 19th century showed that the speed

of light is the same in all inertial systems. Thus

µ = c and e =

where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Based on this, we can
rewrite (16) and (20) as

and the space-time transformations (19) and (21) between two inertial
systems are the Lorentz transformations.

If e = 0, the above space-time transformations become the Galilean
transformations and in this case no velocity is preserved. It can be
shown that the case e < 0 leads to physically absurd results, leaving
only two possibilities for relativistic space-time transformations: the
Galilean and Lorentz transformations.

Since in the Minkowski metric w1 is orthogonal to w−1, the ma-
trix Sb is self-adjoint. Therefore, the adjoint of the relative velocity
b, as a linear operator from time to space, is the operator of non-
simultaneity of a system K ′ moving with relative velocity b with
respect to the lab frame.

4 Velocity addition and symmetry of the

velocity ball

Relativistic velocity addition can be derived from the Lorentz space-
time transformation (19) between two inertial systems as follows.
Consider two inertial systems K and K ′, moving with relative velocity
(boost) b and a motion with uniform velocity v in system K ′. The

world line of this motion is

In case b and v are parallel, this formula becomes:

Note that the velocity addition is commutative only for parallel ve-
locities.

We denote by Dv the set of all relativistically admissible velocities

in an inertial frame K. This set is deﬁned by

It can be shown [7] that the map ϕb is a projective (preserving line
segments) map of Dv. We denote by Autp(Dv) the group of all
projective automorphisms of the domain Dv. The map ϕb belongs
to Autp(Dv). It transforms any relativistically admissible velocity
Dv of the system K ′, which is moving parallel to K with relative
v
velocity b, to a corresponding unique velocity ϕb(v)
Dv in K. The
existence of such a map shows that the ball Dv is homogeneous in
the sense that any two points of this ball can be exchanged by an
element of Autp(Dv). Moreover, the ball Dv is a bounded symmetric
domain, meaning that for any point in Dv there exist a symmetry
belonging to Autp(Dv) which ﬁxes only this point.

Lorentz group.

Note that the Lorentz group representation deﬁned by space-time
transformations (19) between two inertial systems is valid only if the
systems move in parallel and at time t = 0 the origins of the two
systems coincide, while the velocity transformation (38) between two
inertial systems holds for arbitrary systems without any limitation.

5 Kinematics of relativistically accelerated

systems

The ideas used for inertial systems can also be applied with some
modiﬁcations to uniformly accelerated systems. To understand why
we are justiﬁed in applying our method used for the inertial systems to
accelerated systems and what modiﬁcations are needed, consider the
table in Figure 7, which clariﬁes our line of reasoning. It highlights

Figure 7: Comparisons between inertial and uniformly accelerated
systems.

three areas of physics:

•

•

•

Pre-relativity physics, which deals with static space

Relativistic physics, which deals with arbitrary inertial systems

Relativistic physics, which deals with systems that are acceler-
ated with respect to inertial systems.

15

Each of these three areas mentioned has its basic principle which
states that the laws of physics are independent of a particular choice.
In pre-relativity physics, the laws are independent of the choice of a
preferred space direction. In special relativity, the laws are indepen-
dent of the choice of a preferred inertial system. In general relativity,
they are independent of the choice of an arbitrary system.

Pre-relativity physics abandons the notion of a preferred space
direction but maintains a preference for rest (v = 0). Special rela-
tivity, describing uniform motion, abandons the preference for rest
but maintains a preference for constant velocity (a = 0). Here the
preferred type of motion is free motion - a motion which is free in
one inertial system is free in every inertial system. For accelerated
motion, the Principle of General relativity abandons the preference
for constant velocity. Even though there is absolutely no preference
for any particular kind of accelerated system, we will give preference
to uniformly accelerated systems, meaning systems that are uniformly
accelerated with respect to an inertial system. The preferred type of
motion will thus be motion under a constant force.

For relativistic constant velocity motion, we use the space-time
description of events because it is the simplest one which leads to lin-
ear transformations between inertial systems. However, it is impos-
sible to obtain linear transformations between uniformly accelerated
systems using the space-time description. Consequently, for accel-
erated comoving systems, we will use a new description, called the
proper velocity-time description. This will enable us to obtain linear
transformations between comoving uniformly accelerated systems.

Each of these three areas of physics has its own invariants. For
constant velocity motion, our method [7] produced transformations
which preserve a space-time interval and a maximal speed c- the speed
of light. Similarly, for uniformly accelerated motion, our method
will produce transformations which preserve a proper velocity-time
interval and a maximal acceleration.

call proper velocity p-velocity. Note that a p-velocity is expressed as
a vector of R3. Conversely, any vector in R3, with no limitation on
its magnitude, represents a relativistically admissible p-velocity.

The principle of equivalence states that “the laws of physics have
the same form in a uniformly accelerated system as they do in an

16

unaccelerated inertial system in a uniform gravitational ﬁeld.” But
what is the meaning of uniform acceleration in this principle? Con-
sider an inertial system in a constant gravitational ﬁeld G.
If we
position an object freely in this system, then, from the relativistic
dynamic equation, which we write as

we obtain that du

dt remains constant. We deﬁne proper acceleration

.

(40)

(41)

This deﬁnition coincides with the one given in [11] p.71. By this
deﬁnition, a free object in an inertial system with a constant gravi-
tational ﬁeld has constant proper acceleration. By the Equivalence
Principle a uniformly accelerated system has to be one in which the
origin moves with constant proper acceleration. The magnitude of
the proper acceleration is larger then the usual acceleration d2r
dt2 , but
for small velocities, the magnitudes are almost the same.

By uniformly accelerated system in this paper we will mean sys-
tems that are moving with constant proper acceleration with respect
to a given inertial system. As mentioned earlier, we will describe
ﬁrst the transformation between an inertial system and uniformly
accelerated system (in sense of constant proper acceleration).

5.2 Proper velocity - time description of events

An important step in our derivation of the Lorentz space-time trans-
formations between two inertial frames was to show that such trans-
formations are linear. For uniformly accelerated systems, the space-
time transformation is not linear. But, there is another description
of events, called the proper velocity - time description, in which the
transformation of events between two uniformly accelerated systems
is linear.

In the p-velocity-time description, an event is described by the
R3 of the
time at which the event occurred and the p-velocity u
event. Thus, an event in the p-velocity-time description is described
in R4. The evolution of an object is described by

by a vector

∈

the p-velocity u(t) of the object at time t, replacing the world-line of
special relativity. To obtain the position of the object at time t, we
have to know the initial position of the object and then integrate its
velocity, expressed uniquely by the p-velocity, with respect to time.
For example, for a free-falling object which at time t = 0 was
at rest and positioned at the space frame origin, the p-velocity of

t
u

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

17

this object at time t is u(t) = gt, where g is the proper acceleration
generated by the gravitational ﬁeld.

By the principle of equivalence and (40), the motion of an object
under the inﬂuence of a constant force in a uniformly accelerated
system is equivalent to its motion in a constant gravitational ﬁeld.
This motion is described by a straight line in the p-velocity-time
continuum. Conversely, if the motion of an object in the p-velocity-
time continuum of a uniformly accelerated system is described by
a straight line, then the object is under the inﬂuence of a constant
force.

Two systems moving parallel to each other are called comoving if
at some initial time t0 their relative velocity is zero. Consider now
two comoving systems Kg and K0, uniformly accelerated with respect
to an inertial system K with a constant acceleration g between them.
We assume that at time t = 0 the relative velocity of K0 with respect
to Kg is zero.

Denote by T the transformation mapping the time and p-velocity
t
u

of an event, measured in Kg, to the time and p-velocity of the

(cid:18)
(cid:19)
same event

t′
u′

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

, measured in K0. As we have stated, motion un-

der a constant force in one uniformly accelerated system with respect
to an inertial system K is equivalent to motion under a diﬀerent, but
constant, force in K. Thus, motion under a constant force in one ac-
celerated system with respect to an inertial system K will be of the
same type in any other system uniformly accelerated with respect to
K. Since such motion is described by a straight line in p-velocity
time continuum, this implies that the map T preserves straight lines.
We also assumed that relative velocity of K0 with respect to Kg is
zero at time t = 0. Thus, by a known theorem in mathematics, maps
preserving straight lines and mapping the origin to the origin are
linear. Since T satisﬁes these conditions, the transformation T is a
linear map.

5.3 Identiﬁcation of symmetry

To deﬁne the symmetry operator between two uniformly accelerated
systems, we will use an extension of the principle of relativity, which
we will call the General Principle of Relativity. This principle, as it
was formulated by M. Born (see [2], p. 312), states that the “laws of
physics involve only relative positions and motions of bodies. From
this it follows that no system of reference may be favored a priori as
the inertial systems were favored in special relativity.”

The principle of relativity from special relativity states that there
is no preferred inertial system, and, therefore, the notion of rest (zero
velocity) is a relative notion. The motions which were common for all

18

inertial systems are the free (constant velocity) motions. From the
general principle of relativity, it follows that there is no preference for
inertial (zero acceleration) systems. Hence, when considering acceler-
ated systems, we no longer give preference to free motion (zero force)
over constant force motion. This makes all uniformly accelerated
systems equivalent. The motion which is common for all accelerated
systems is motion under a constant force.

From the general principle of relativity, it is logical to assume
that the transformations between the descriptions of an event in two
uniformly accelerated systems depend only on the relative motion be-
tween these systems. Thus, if we choose reference frames in the two
uniformly accelerated systems Kg and K0 in a way that the descrip-
tion of relative motion of K0 with respect to Kg coincides with the
description of relative motion of Kg with respect to K0, then the
transformation T , deﬁned above, will coincide with the transforma-
tion

T from K0 to Kg. This implies that T is a symmetry.

e

In order for this transformation to be a symmetry, we have to
choose the space axes in such a way that the description of the relative
position of system two with respect to system one coincides with the
description of the relative position of system one with respect to
system two. This can be done in the same way as was done for
inertial systems in Section 2.2. By reversing the p-velocity axes in
K0 we can make the relative acceleration of Kg with respect to K0
also be g.

In order to describe the precise meaning of “the system K0 moves
with uniform acceleration g with respect to Kg,” we consider an event
connected to an object which is at rest at O′-the origin of K0. The
p-velocity of this object in K0 is u′ = 0. The acceleration of system
K0 with respect to Kg expresses the p-velocity u of this object after
time t in Kg. Thus, p-velocity in system K0 and time in Kg served
as inputs and p-velocity in Kg as an output. This corresponds to the
hybrid connection discussed in Section 2.3.2.

The p-velocity-time transformation Sg between these frames can
be considered as a “two-port linear black box” transformation with
two inputs and two outputs.
In each system, the time and the p-
velocity of an event are the two ports. We choose the inputs to be the
scalar t, the time of the event in Kg, and the three-dimensional vector
u′ describing the p-velocity of the event in K0. Then the outputs are
the scalar t′, the time of the event in K0, and the three-dimensional
vector u describing the p-velocity of the event in Kg. We denote by

the time t in Kg of an event with p-velocity u′ = 0 (at rest in K0) to
its time t′ in K0, and it is given by

, as in Figure 3.

t′ = S11(t) = βt,

(43)

for some constant β. The constant β expresses the slowdown of the
clocks at rest in K0 due to its acceleration relative to Kg. The value of
β is related to the well-known Clock Hypothesis. Recall that the Clock
Hypothesis states that the “rate of an accelerated clock is identical to
that of instantaneously comoving inertial clock.” Now the p-velocity
of K0 with respect to Kg was zero at time t = 0. Therefore, at time
t = 0, both K0 and Kg have the same comoving inertial system.
Thus, the clock hypothesis would imply β = 1.

To deﬁne the maps S12 and S22, we will consider an event occur-
ring at time t = 0 in Kg with p-velocity u′ measured in K0. Then
S12(u′) will be the time of this event in K0, and S22(u′) will be the
p-velocity of this event in Kg. Since S12 is a linear map from R3 to
R, we have

6 Conservation of p-velocity time inter-

val and maximal acceleration

As mentioned above, the p-velocity-time transformation between the
systems Kg and K0 is a symmetry transformation. Such a symmetry
is a reﬂection with respect to the set of points ﬁxed by the symmetry.
The events ﬁxed by the transformation Sg are on a straight line
through the origin of the p-velocity-time continuum, corresponding

The previous equation implies that our p-velocity-time transforma-
tion from Kg to K0 conserves the interval

e

with ν deﬁned by (58) and thus is a Lorentz-type transformations.

Note that the zero-interval world-lines are transformed by these
transformations to zero-interval lines. The zero-interval world-lines
correspond to motion with uniform acceleration ν depending only on
the magnitude g of the relative accelerations between the systems,
which we denote by νg. Thus, for two systems Kg and K0 with
κ > 0, the acceleration νg deﬁned by (58) is conserved.

Considering three accelerated comoving systems: where system
two is moving in parallel with acceleration g with respect to system
one and system three is moving in parallel with the same acceleration
g with respect to system two we obtain that ν2g = νg. By use of an
argument similar to the one in [7], section 1.2.2, it can be shown that
the conserved acceleration νg is independent of the relative accelera-
tion g between the frames Kg and K0 and we will denote it by aM .

The existence of a maximal acceleration follows also from Born’s
reciprocity principle, which states [2] that the laws of nature are

symmetric with respect to space and momentum. We think that
“momentum” should be replaced by “proper velocity” in Born’s reci-
procity principle. Such reciprocity could not be achieved with the
Galilean transformation for the proper-velocity time continuum. As
we have shown, this implies the existence of a maximal acceleration.
Caianiello’s model [3] also supports Born’s reciprocity principle.As
shown by Schuller [14], the Muon Storage Ring experiment (see [1]
10−39(s2/m)2 and from the
and [6]) implies that the constant κ < 1.6
relativistic correction of the Thomas precession κ < 10−44(s2/m)2,
which is indeed close to zero. From Caianiello’s model, the estimate of
10−103(s2/m)2.
the maximal acceleration in Scarpetta [13] is κ = 0.4
But the existence and the real value of maximal acceleration could
be obtained only from experiment, directly or indirectly.

8 Space-time transformations to a uni-
formly accelerated system without the
Clock Hypothesis

As we have shown, if the Clock Hypothesis is not valid, there exist
a unique maximal acceleration. Then from (43) and (49), it follows
that

This equation was called the modiﬁed Clock hypothesis by Shuller
[14]. It shows that the dependence of the rate of an accelerated clock
is due to its acceleration as well as its velocity.

At this point we do not know how to obtain an explicit space-time
K uniformly
transformation from an inertial system K to a system
accelerated with respect to K without assuming the Clock hypothesis.
But we can do this for any given world-line (t, r(t)) in K by the
following algorithm:

e

Algorithm: Step 1. Use Lorentz transformations to obtain a

world-line (t′, r′(t′)) in K ′ the comoving frame to

K.

Step 2. Translate this world line (t′, r′(t)) from space-time rep-
resentation to a world-line (t′, u′(t)) in the p-velocity-time represen-
tation in K ′.

e

Step 3. Use transformation (52) to obtain world-line (˜t, ˜u(t)) in

the p-velocity-time representation in ˜K. Finally,

Step 4. Using the formula

r(t) =

v(λ)dλ =

corresponding to the world-line (t, r(t)) in K.

Einstein’s relativistic Doppler formula

Abstract

We note that Einstein’s relativistic Doppler formula presents a strange
aspect. For incident light received under a ﬁxed non zero angle, the
Doppler shift will change from blueshift to redshift (or vice-versa) for
some critical relative velocity of the observer and the source.

It is very well known that Einstein’s deduction of doppler relativis-
tic formula is entirely based on the invariance of the phase of a
planewave. Einstein’s obtains the following formula (1):

From the equation for ω′ it follows that if an observer is moving
with velocity v relatively to an inﬁnitely distant source of light of
frequency ν, in such a way that the connection line ”source-observer”
makes an angle φ with the velocity of the the observer referred to a
system of co-ordinates which is at rest relatively to the source of
light, the frequency ν′ of the light perceived by the observer is given
by the equation

q
This is Doppler principle for any velocities whatever. When φ = 0,
the equation assumes the perspicuous form

(1)

(2)

We see that in contrast with the customary view, when v =

−c, v′ = ∞

Now if we put in Einstein’s formula φ = π

2 in (1), we obtain

The immediate constatation is that for φ = 0 (2) we have a redishift (

1) and for φ = π

2 we have a blueshift (

> 1)

It is clear that for each velocity v, there is angle for which there is no Doppler

eﬀect (D = 1). It is very easy to ﬁnd the critical angle φt:

In standard books on special relativity, we always ﬁnd the non-null transverse

c → 0 , φ = 90◦). We ﬁnd
from cos φ = 1 ( v
for the small velocities that the critical angle of transition φt between blueshift
and redshift is a right angle (change of sign of cosinus or change of sign of the
velocity).

We obtain inversely from (4)

So for example if cos φt = 1

5 . So for an angle of 60◦ and for a velocity
about 240.000 km/s, Einstein’s relativistic formula predicts that there is no
′
Doppler eﬀect. If we take the angle φ
in the system of observer with the
cos φ− v
c
formula cos φ
c cos φ , we arrive exactly to the same conclusion. We note
1− v
′
that for φ
2

= 90◦, we obtain cos φ = v

c 6= cos φt ≈ 1

v
c .

So the critical angle φt has nothing to do with the relativistic transformation

=

′

of angle.

There is no explanation for this very singular transition blueshift-redshift in
the framework of Einstein’s kinematics. So without any change of the orienta-
tion of the velocity (for example a receding object) we pass from a redshift to a
blueshift by a change of the intensity of the velocity.

We will prove in another communication that this very serious problem is
connected with Poincar´e’s elongated ellipse from which we obtain another deﬁni-
tion of the units of space and time and also another relativistic Doppler formula
(reference 2).

Abstract

Consistently with the Einstein equivalence principle, we show that a local observer
cannot observe negative–phase–velocity propagation of electromagnetic waves in vac-
uum, whereas a global observer can.

Keywords: General theory of relativity, Negative phase velocity, Special theory of relativity

1 Introduction

Recently, we have shown that electromagnetic plane waves can propagate in classical vacuum
in such a way that the phase velocity vector has a negative projection on the time–averaged
Poynting vector, provided that the vacuum is nontrivially aﬀected by a gravitational ﬁeld
[1]. This negative–phase–velocity (NPV) propagation characteristic depends on the direction
of the propagation wavevector but not on the frequency. NPV propagation characteristics
in certain homogeneous material mediums lead to the phenomenon of negative refraction
[2, 3, 4], which suggests the possibility of gravitationally assisted negative refraction of
electromagnetic waves by vacuum, with attendant scientiﬁc and technological implications
for space–bound humanity [1, 5].

Researchers have studied electromagnetic wave propagation in terrestrial environments
for several centuries, and our planet is certainly aﬀected by the solar gravitational ﬁeld. Yet,
NPV propagation in classical vacuum has never been reported in the terrestrial context.
Although the solar gravitational ﬁeld evidently does not satisfy the conditions for NPV
propagation that were reported in Ref. [1], this does beg the question: Are global and local
perspectives of gravitationally assisted NPV propagation diﬀerent? In this communication,
we answer that question in the aﬃrmative.

2 Maxwell equations in universal spacetime

In the absence of charges and currents, electromagnetic ﬁelds obey the covariant Maxwell
equations‡

fαβ;ν + fβν;α + fνα;β = 0 ,

hαβ

;β = 0 ,

(1)

where fαβ and hαβ are, respectively, the covariant and the contravariant electromagnetic ﬁeld
tensors whereas the subscript ;ν indicates the covariant derivative with respect to the νth
spacetime coordinate. The spacetime — denoted by the vector xα containing the normalized
time coordinate x0 = ct (with c as the maximum speed of light in the absence of the
gravitational ﬁeld) and the space coordinates x1, x2, and x3 — is Riemannian, with the
metric gαβ being a function of spacetime and carrying the signature (+,

) [6].

It is commonplace to follow up on a suggestion of Tamm [7]–[9] and change the form of
(1) for application to electromagnetic ﬁelds in vacuum. The Maxwell equations (1) may be
expressed in noncovariant form as

wherein g = det [gαβ] and the subscript ,ν denotes ordinary diﬀerentiation with respect to
the νth spacetime coordinate. Let us introduce the electromagnetic ﬁeld vectors Eℓ, Bℓ, Dℓ
and Hℓ via the standard decompositions

Eℓ = fℓ0 ,
Dℓ = (

g)1/2 hℓ0 ,

Bℓ = (1/2)εℓmnfmn
Hℓ = (1/2)εℓmn (

g)1/2 hmn

−

,

(cid:27)

with εℓmn being the three–dimensional Levi–Civita symbol. Thereby the noncovariant Maxwell
equations (2) assume the familiar form

Bℓ,ℓ = 0 , Bℓ,0 + εℓmnEm,n = 0
Dℓ,0 + εℓmnHm,n = 0
Dℓ,ℓ = 0 ,

−

.

(cid:27)

In vacuum, the components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensors are connected by the

constitutive relations

hαβ = gαµ gβν fµν ,

fαβ = gαµ gβν hµν .

‡Roman indexes take the values 1, 2 and 3; Greek indexes take the values 0, 1, 2, and 3; summation is

implied over any repeated index; and Gaussian units are used.

Equations (1) and (5) employ curved spacetime. So do (4) and (6), but the diﬀerence
is that they look like the familiar electromagnetic equations in ﬂat spacetime applied to an
instantaneously reacting, bianisotropic medium. Techniques commonly employed to handle
electromagnetic problems in the absence of gravitational ﬁelds should therefore be useful for
solving (4) and (6).

3 Global perspective

of spacetime, subject
Suppose that we wish to solve these equations in a certain region
into
to speciﬁc boundary conditions. A fairly standard procedure would be to partition
subregions (n)
, (n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ), in each of which we would replace the nonuniform metric
gαβ by the uniform metric (n)˜gαβ. After solving (4) and (6) in each subregion, we could stitch
back the subregional solutions into the regional solution. This piecewise uniform approx-
imation technique is very common for solving diﬀerential equations with nonhomogeneous
coeﬃcients [10].

Accordingly, let us focus on the nth subregion. A four–dimensional Fourier transform
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld vectors can be taken, with kα denoting the Fourier variable
corresponding to xα; thus,

etc., where i = √
1. The usual temporal frequency ω = k0c, while kℓ denotes the wavevec-
tor. An adequate representation for Eℓ(kα) can be set up, as shown in the predecessor paper
[1].

We remark that Eℓ(kα) is the complex–valued amplitude of the electric ﬁeld associated
with a plane wave, for which a time–averaged Poynting vector Pℓ(kα) can be derived. When
the projection of kℓ on Pℓ(kα) is negative, we say that the phase velocity is negative. NPV
propagation is indicated by the satisfaction of either of the following two conditions:

In these inequalities, (n)˜γ1, (n)˜γ2, and (n)˜γ3 are the three eigenvalues of (n)˜γℓm; θ is the angle
between the wavevector kℓ and the eigenvector of (n)˜γℓm corresponding to the eigenvalue
(n)˜γ3; the quantity

and (n)˜γℓm is constructed from (n)˜gαβ in the manner speciﬁed by (7). The eigenvalues of (n)˜γℓm
are negative by virtue of the signature of gαβ, and both NPV conditions are independent of
k0.

4 Local perspective

The previous two sections are from a global perspective. Let us now attend to the local
perspective of an observer located in the subregion (m)
. This observer is constrained to

formulate an electromagnetic theory valid only in (m)
, and this theory must emerge from
observations made only in that subregion. The gravitational ﬁeld in this subregion can be
held to be virtually uniform, the metric from the global perspective being (m)˜gαβ. However,
given the admissibility of the uniform–gravity theory for all local observers in (m)
, we show
here that the local observer would end up formulating a local metric — which is the same
as in the special theory of relativity.

By construction, we can ensure that the piecewise uniform approximation (m)˜gαβ yields

at least one point ℘

(m)˜gαβ = gαβ|℘ .
By virtue of the Einstein equivalence principle [11], gαβ is constrained to be such that there

Furthermore, as (m)Λα
µ depends upon the uniform metric (m)˜gαβ associated with each subre-
gion, a global coordinate transformation which simultaneously transforms each (m)˜gαβ to ηµν
cannot be realized.

In the local coordinate system x′α, the spacetime metric in subregion m is given as ηαβ.
Repeating the steps oultined in Section 2 with ηαβ substituting for gαβ, we ﬁnd that the
local constitutive relations for subregion m reduce to the trivial form

5 Concluding remarks

Thus, we have shown that gravitationally assisted negative–phase–velocity propagation in
vacuum can be appreciated only from a global perspective based on curved spacetime;
whereas a local observer, constrained to a ﬂat spacetime, must conclude NPV propaga-
tion is impossible in vacuum. The diversity of the local and the global perspectives is in full
accord with the Einstein equivalent principle.

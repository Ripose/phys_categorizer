Abstract

We examine the classical problem of an inﬁnite square well by considering Hamil-
ton’s equations in one dimension and Hamilton-Jacobi equation for motion in two
dimensions. We illustrate, by means of suitable examples, the nature of the periodic
motion of a particle trapped inside the well.

1 Introduction

The square well potential [1], also referred to as the square billiard in the literature [2],

describes the conﬁnement of a particle trapped in a box with inﬁnite walls. Being a rather

simple system that is solvable in both classical and quantum mechanics, it has appeared,

along with the harmonic oscillator [3, 4], as an example of natural enquiry in the devel-

opments of semiclassical theories [5, 6], supersymmetric quantum mechanics [7, 8], PT

symmetry [9, 10, 11], and also in models of coherent states [12].

At the classical level, the characteristic frequency of the particle in the well is related

to the natural frequency of the harmonic oscillator by a factor π/2 at the same energy and

amplitude. Indeed choosing the origin at the centre of the well and x axis along its length,
the total energy of a particle of mass m trapped inside the well is given by E = (1/2)mv2
x,
where vx is the velocity of the particle and the collisions at the ends are assumed to be

perfectly reﬂective. Note that because of the inﬁnite nature of the walls the particle cannot

go past them. Now, to cover the distance from x = −a to x = a inside the well, 2a being the

length of the well, the time T /2 taken by the particle is T /2 = 2a/vx. Writing T = 2π/ω,

where ω is the characteristic frequency that we associate with the particle, it transpires
that vx = 2aω/π along with E = (1/2)mω2(2a)2/π2. Comparing with the energy formula
E = (1/2)mΩ2a2 of the harmonic oscillator corresponding to an amplitude a and frequency

Ω, we arrive at the aforementioned result.

It may be mentioned that for the quantum mechanical situation, using the Sommerfeld-

Wilson quantization rule [13], namely

−a
a (−mvx) dx = nh,
we get px = mvx = nh/(4a), implying px to be quantized. Physically it means that if we
R

px dx = nh, i.e.,

a
−a mvx dx +

H

R

decrease a (i.e., resort to squeezing), px increases. For the above px, the quantized energy
levels read En = n2h2/(32ma2), n = 1, 2, . . . . It follows that the energy levels of a quantum
particle inside the well are entirely discrete, nondegenerate, and not equispaced as for the

case of the harmonic oscillator.

However, contrary to the quantum case, graduate level textbooks are rather brief with

the classical problem of the inﬁnite square well. Our aim in this article is to present a

somewhat detailed mathematical exposition of it in one and two dimensions that brings

out clearly the periodic nature of the trajectories of a particle trapped in it. In section 2,

we deal with the one-dimensional motion starting from Hamilton’s equations of motion and

show that the motion of the particle is periodic with period T = 4ma/p0, p0 being its initial

2

momentum. In section 3, we solve the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to demonstrate how we

run into periodic trajectories in two-dimensional systems as well. In section 4, we illustrate

the above results by means of nontrivial but elementary examples, which to the best of our

knowledge, have not appeared before. Finally, in section 5, a conclusion is presented.

2 One-dimensional motion

Let us analyze the classical square well problem in one dimension by starting from Hamil-
ton’s equations. Taking the Hamiltonian H = p2/(2m) between the two barriers at x = −a

and x = a (note that the particle is free inside the well) and imposing the initial condition

x0 = 0 at t = t0 = 0 with the momentum p0 > 0, we ﬁnd the trajectory to be

No sooner the particle reaches the barrier at x = a, which occurs at say t = t1, given by

t1 = ma/p0, it reverses direction and its trajectory then is described by

Obviously, equation (2) holds until the particle reaches the other barrier at x = −a, which

occurs at t = t2 = 3ma/p0. Then it reverses direction again, its trajectory being

x =

p0

t > 0.

x = −

(t − t1) + a

x =

(t − t2) − a

t > t2.

(3)

so long as it does not reach x = a.

Continuing like this, we may summarize our results for the trajectory as follows

x =

x = −

x =

(t − t2ν) − a

t2ν ≤ t < t2ν+1

(4)

where ν = 1, 2, . . . and tn = (2n − 1)ma/p0, n = 1, 2, . . . .

Hence we conclude that the motion of the particle inside the one-dimensional well is

periodic with period T = 4ma/p0.

3 Two-dimensional motion

To enquire into the periodic nature of the trajectories of the particle in two dimensions it

is instructive to start from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

Consider the following canonical transformation of the coordinates and momenta

for two degrees of freedom: q = (q1, q2), p = (p1, p2), Q = (Q1, Q2), P = (P1, P2). The

Hamilton-Jacobi equation

is concerned with the canonical transformation from (q, p) to new variables (β, α) that are

constant in time:

p =

∂F (q, α, t)
∂q

β =

∂F (q, α, t)
∂α

where F denotes the type-two generating function, β = (β1, β2), and α = (α1, α2).

We consider the time-independent case when t does not appear explicitly in H:

To solve (8) the standard procedure is to employ a separation of variables on F :

This results in

where the left-hand side is a function of q only while the right-hand side is a function of t

only. So each side must be a constant E:

H

q,

 

∂F
∂q !

= −E.

Consider now a two-dimensional square well with centre at (0, 0) and vertices at

(±a, ±a):

V (x, y) = 0

|x| < a and |y| < a

= ∞ |x| > a or |y| > a.

where the constants α2

Integrating (14) and substituting the result in (7) yields

Equation (16) is consistent with the fact that as soon as the particle, moving freely inside

the well, approaches the inﬁnite barriers at x = ±a, it reverses direction.

The action variables can now be evaluated in the following manner

Ix =

Similarly we have Iy = 4aαy. As a consequence, E can be expressed as

E =

The corresponding frequencies are

We thus see that periodic orbits occur when the periods of motion Tx and Ty along the

x and y axes are such that

where nx and ny are integers. In other words, the particle always returns to its starting

point with its initial velocity with a period

Equation (20) is the central result for the two-dimensional case, which we illustrate below

by means of some simple examples.

4 Illustrations

Let a particle, under the inﬂuence of the potential (12), start from the centre with a

momentum making an angle θ with the x axis, i.e.,

t0 = 0

x0 = y0 = 0

= tan θ.

(22)

px0

If tan θ is a rational number, i.e., tan θ = ny/nx where nx and ny are integers, then the

motion is periodic with a period T given by (21). To show how equations (21) and (22)

may work in practice, we consider two concrete examples.

4.1 Example 1: tan θ = 1/2 or nx = 2, ny = 1

Here we notice that during the ﬁrst period, the particle takes the following path (see

ﬁgure 1):

• x = (px0/m)t, y = (py0/m)t if t0 = 0 ≤ t < t1 = ma/px0. At t = t1, x1 = a, y1 = a/2.

• x = −(px0/m)(t − t1) + a, y = (py0/m)(t − t1) + a/2 if t1 ≤ t < t2 = 2t1. At t = t2,

x2 = 0, y2 = a.

x3 = −a, y3 = a/2.

x6 = 0, y6 = −a.

y7 = −a/2.

• x = −(px0/m)(t − t2), y = −(py0/m)(t − t2) + a if t2 ≤ t < t3 = 3t1. At t = t3,

• x = (px0/m)(t − t3) − a, y = −(py0/m)(t − t3) + a/2 if t3 ≤ t < t5 = 5t1. At t = t5,

x5 = a, y5 = −a/2. Note that at t = t4 = 4t1, the particle goes through the origin

(x4 = y4 = 0), but the components of its momentum are diﬀerent from those at t = t0,

namely (px0, −py0) instead of (px0, py0).

• x = −(px0/m)(t − t5) + a, y = −(py0/m)(t − t5) − a/2 if t5 ≤ t < t6 = 6t1. At t = t6,

• x = −(px0/m)(t − t6), y = (py0/m)(t − t6) − a if t6 ≤ t < t7 = 7t1. At t = t7, x7 = −a,

• x = (px0/m)(t − t7) − a, y = (py0/m)(t − t7) − a/2 if t7 ≤ t < t8 = 8t1. At t = t8,

x8 = y8 = 0 and the particle has the same momentum as at t = t0.

The period is therefore T = t8 = 8t1 = 8ma/px0. One also notes that the periods Tx

and Ty are

Tx = t4 = 4t1 =

Ty = t8 = 8t1 =

so that equation (21) becomes T = 2Tx = Ty, as it should be.

4.2 Example 2: tan θ = 2/3 or nx = 3, ny = 2

For this case, the particle goes along the following path (see ﬁgure 2):

• x = (px0/m)t, y = (py0/m)t if t0 = 0 ≤ t < t1 = ma/px0. At t = t1, x1 = a,

y1 = 2a/3.

x2 = a/2, y2 = a.

x3 = −a, y3 = 0.

x4 = a/2, y4 = −a.

x5 = a, y5 = −2a/3.

• x = −(px0/m)(t − t1) + a, y = (py0/m)(t − t1) + 2a/3 if t1 ≤ t < t2 = 3t1/2. At t = t2,

• x = −(px0/m)(t − t2) + a/2, y = −(py0/m)(t − t2) + a if t2 ≤ t < t3 = 3t1. At t = t3,

• x = (px0/m)(t − t3) − a, y = −(py0/m)(t − t3) if t3 ≤ t < t4 = 9t1/2. At t = t4,

• x = (px0/m)(t − t4) + a/2, y = (py0/m)(t − t4) − a if t4 ≤ t < t5 = 5t1. At t = t5,

7

• x = −(px0/m)(t − t5) + a, y = (py0/m)(t − t5) − 2a/3 if t5 ≤ t < t7 = 7t1. At t = t7,

x7 = −a, y7 = 2a/3. Note that at t = t6 = 6t1, the particle goes through the origin

(x6 = y6 = 0), but the components of the momentum are diﬀerent from those at

t = t0, namely (−px0, py0) instead of (px0, py0).

• x = (px0/m)(t − t7) − a, y = (py0/m)(t − t7) + 2a/3 if t7 ≤ t < t8 = 15t1/2. At t = t8,

x8 = −a/2, y8 = a.

x9 = a, y9 = 0.

x10 = −a/2, y10 = −a.

• x = (px0/m)(t − t8) − a/2, y = −(py0/m)(t − t8) + a if t8 ≤ t < t9 = 9t1. At t = t9,

• x = −(px0/m)(t − t9) + a, y = −(py0/m)(t − t9) if t9 ≤ t < t10 = 21t1/2. At t = t10,

• x = −(px0/m)(t − t10) − a/2, y = (py0/m)(t − t10) − a if t10 ≤ t < t11 = 11t1. At

t = t11, x11 = −a, y11 = −2a/3.

• x = (px0/m)(t − t11) − a, y = (py0/m)(t − t11) − 2a/3 if t11 ≤ t < t12 = 12t1. At

t = t12, x12 = y12 = 0 and the particle has the same momentum as at t = t0.

The period is therefore T = t12 = 12t1 = 12ma/px0 along with

Tx = t5 − t1 = 4t1 =

5 Conclusion

(27)

(28)

The motion of a particle trapped inside a square well with inﬁnite barriers is well known to

be periodic. While most textbooks leave the issue at that, we have, in this article, pursued

the problem a little further by taking a closer look at the basic equations and enquiring as

to how these may work in practice. To this end, we have examined Hamilton’s equations

in one dimension and Hamilton-Jacobi equation for motion in two dimensions. We have

then constructed a couple of insightful examples to demonstrate how the periodicity of

trajectories takes place.

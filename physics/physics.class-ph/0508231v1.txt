Abstract

Plane electromagnetic wave propagating in perfect electromagnetic con-
ductor (PEMC) is considered. Its wave number has no connection with the
frequency. An interface is introduced between an ordinary isotropic medium
and PEMC. The wave in PEMC is matched to plane electromagnetic wave
incident normally on the interface from the ordinary medium and reﬂected
from it. Then the plane-parallel slab made of PEMC is considered and a
plane wave is found in it.

1 Introduction

Recently Lindell and Sihvola [1] generalized the notions of perfect electric conduc-
tor and perfect magnetic conductor to perfect electromagnetic conductor (PEMC)
for which the constitutive relation between the electromagnetic ﬁelds is exotic in
comparison with the ordinary media like vacuum or air. In diﬀerential-form rep-
dt and
resentation of the ﬁelds this relation reads G = αF where G = D
F = B + E
dt. The pseudoscalar parameter α was called admittance in [2] and
axion ﬁeld in [3]. Its zero limit yields the perfect magnetic conductor, its inﬁnity
limit yields the perfect electric conductor. For the three-dimensional ﬁelds E, B, H,
D the above constitutive relation means D = αB, H =

αE.

where ei is the 4-dimensional vector basis of the tangent space. If one substitutes

for any electromagnetic ﬁeld in PEMC the energy density, energy ﬂux and the stress
is zero. The same must be true for the electromagnetic wave in such a medium.

In [1], among others, a problem of linearly polarized plane electromagnetic wave
incident normally on a PEMC boundary was considered by the method of duality

transformation. It was found that the reﬂected wave contains the cross-polarized
term that is, the component of the electric ﬁeld perpendicular to that of the incident
ﬁeld. A similar problem was considered in [3], namely the propagation of plane
electromagnetic wave in the ordinary medium with additional piecewise constant
It was shown that the reﬂection of the wave occurs at an interface
axion ﬁeld.
between two media with diﬀerent axion values.

We present the explicit formula for a linearly polarized plane electromagnetic
wave in PEMC medium which – as it was mentioned above – does not contain energy
nor transmits energy. We consider also the plane electromagnetic wave incident
normally from the vacuum on a boundary of PEMC and use the standard boundary
conditions to match it with the wave in PEMC. It turns out that the reﬂected
wave must be present on the side of the vacuum, and it contains the cross-polarized
term. It is an open question whether the wave present in PEMC could be called
transmitted wave, if it does not transmit any energy.

Afterwards, we consider a plane-parallel slab made of PEMC and the plane
electromagnetic wave in it such that on the left-hand side of the slab, the same
incident and reﬂected waves are present, and on the right-hand side, no wave is
present.

2 Plane electromagnetic wave

In the diﬀerential-form formulation of electrodynamics the electromagnetic ﬁelds
are the following objects: B is two-form, D is twisted two-form, E is one-form, H
is twisted one-form. The Maxwell equations are general, i.e.
independent on the
metric of space and properties of a medium (we write them in a region devoid of
charges and currents):

the external form is parallel to S, its restriction to S is zero. For the explanation
of direction of an external form see [5]. For instance, in the Cartesian coordinates
x, y, z in ﬂat space the one-form dx is parallel to the (Y, Z)-plane and so on with
dy is parallel to the Z-axis

We seek the solutions to the Maxwell equations in the form of plane wave propa-
gating along the X-axis, i.e. when the ﬁelds are functions of a single scalar variable

−

E(x, t) = Ey(η) dy + Ez(η) dz,

B(x, t) = Bxy(η) dx

dy + Bxz(η) dx

∧
Usually Ey, Ez, Bxy, Bxz are taken as combinations of sine and cosine functions of
η which is tantamount to assume that the wave is time-harmonic. We present our
reasoning without this assumption.

They allow us to write immediately the expressions for the ﬁelds H and D when (6)
and (8) are given. Thus we summarize the formulas for the electromagnetic ﬁelds

the X-axis:

Let us write down another plane wave propagating along the same axis with the
opposite phase velocity. The ﬁelds of this wave are expressed by scalar functions g1,

3 Reﬂection from PEMC boundary

Let the space be divided on two parts by the plane x = 0. For the left half-space
x < 0 we assume homogeneous medium characterized by α = 0 and constant values
ε, µ. For the right half-space x > 0 we assume ε = µ = 0 and constant value α which
means that it is PEMC medium. Consider a plane linearly polarized electromagnetic
wave travelling along the X-axis in the left half-space. Such a normally incident
wave will partially penetrate the PEMC medium and partially be reﬂected from the
interface. Therefore we assume that in the left medium the electromagnetic ﬁeld
will be a superposition of plane waves, right- and left-travelling along the X-axis.

We assume that the right-travelling wave has the linear polarization parallel to

Y -axis; such a ﬁeld is expressed as follows

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

Ey+(η+) dz,

−

∧
One cannot expect that the reﬂected wave will have the same linear polarization
– in fact, it has to contain a component of E parallel to dz, because this gives rise to
a component of H parallel to dy which by (21) must be present in the right medium.
Thence we admit that the reﬂected wave in the left medium has the general form
(17–20). Thus the full electromagnetic ﬁeld in the left medium is the following
superposition

E(x, t) = [Ey+(η+) + Ey−(η−)] dy + Ez−(η−) dz,

B(x, t) = √εµ dx

[Ey+(η+)

In order to not restrict generality we assume that in the right medium the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld is also a superposition of two opposite travelling plane waves, hence
we write the sums of expressions (23–26) with the corresponding expressions (28–31)

∧ {

We now consider the boundary conditions (4), (5) on the plane x = 0. The conditions
(4) are satisﬁed trivially, because the two-forms (37), (39), (41) and (43) are parallel
to the interface (they contain the factor dx), thus their restrictions to it are zero. The
one-forms (36,38,40,42) are perpendicular to the interface, hence their restrictions
to it are equal to themselves. Thus the boundary conditions (5) reduce to

E(0, t) = ˜E(0, t),

H(0, t) = ˜H(0, t),

and, after equating independent components, yield four equalities

the ﬁeld present in PEMC medium can be chosen in arbitrary combination of the

Ey+(η−) [(ε

Formula (49) coincides (after appropriate change of notation) with the formula (41)
in [1]. The electric ﬁeld (32) of the incident wave is parallel to dy. The electric ﬁeld
(49) of the reﬂected wave contains the extra component parallel to dz. Lindell and
Sihvola in [1] call it”cross-polarized component”.

The Poynting two-form for the reﬂected wave ﬁelds (49) and (50) reads

S−(x, t) = E−(x, t)

H−(x, t) =

The other ﬁelds are obtained through ˜H =

4 Plane wave in PEMC slab

The reasoning of previous section is based on the assumption that PEMC medium
ﬁlls the whole half-space x > 0. This assumption is nonphysical, it is natural to
assume, rather, that the PEMC medium forms a plane-parallel slab deﬁned by the
condition 0 < x < b. What conditions should be imposed on the electromagnetic
ﬁelds on the other interface x = b? Since no energy is transmitted through PEMC,
we suppose that the same occurs for x > b. The zero energy ﬂux cannot be accom-
plished by a superposition of left- and right-travelling waves giving total energy ﬂux

equal to zero, because there is no physical reason for a presence of the electromag-
netic wave incoming from the right inﬁnity. In this manner we arrive to conclusion
that the electromagnetic ﬁelds should vanish for x > b. The boundary conditions
(4) are satisﬁed trivially because the two-forms (41, 43) are parallel to dx. The
other condition 5) assumes the form

˜E(b, t) = 0,

˜H(b, t) = 0.

It is suﬃcient to consider the ﬁrst equality, because ˜H =

where a = ˜kb + ˜qb. As is visible from (61, 62), the values a = 2nπ for integer n are
not allowable for the time-harmonic wave. This fact can be interpreted as follows.
As mentioned earlier, the wave numbers ˜k, ˜q are independent of the wave number
k in the left ordinary medium, i.e. in the half-space x < 0. The values of ˜k and ˜q
which yield ˜kb + ˜qb = 2nπ can not be present in the solution (64, 65) valid for the
PEMC slab.

5 Conclusion

A plane electromagnetic wave propagating in PEMC has been presented. The nor-
mal reﬂection of plane electromagnetic wave from the PEMC boundary has been
considered with the use of boundary conditions. It turned out that the ﬁeld strengths
of the reﬂected wave are the same as in [1].

An interesting result is that the wave present in PEMC may contain two arbitrary
functions f1, f2 which are present in the right- and left-travelling waves. By and
appropriate choice of them one can assure the presence of the right-travelling wave
only, or the left-travelling one only. This is possible because no energy is transported
by these waves. In a sense they are virtual waves. Moreover, the two oppositely
travelling waves in PEMC may contain wave numbers ˜k and ˜q in their phases,
which may be diﬀerent from each other and from the wave number k in the ordinary
medium.

The above mentioned observations are true for the PEMC medium extending
from x = 0 to inﬁnity. Since this is nonphysical situation, we have assumed that
PEMC extends from x = 0 to x = b, i.e.
it forms a plane-parallel slab. On a one
side of it, there are incident and reﬂected waves, whereas on the other side of it,
there is no electromagnetic ﬁelds at all. We have shown that the functions f1, f2
must have unique shapes for the time-harmonic wave incident from the left.

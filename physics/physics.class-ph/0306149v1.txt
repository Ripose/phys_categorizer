Abstract

We calculate the phase space volume Ω occupied by a nonextensive system of N classical

particles described by an equilibrium (or steady-state, or long-term stationary state of a nonequi-

librium system) distribution function, which slightly deviates from Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB)

distribution in the high energy tail. We explicitly require that the number of accessible microstates

does not change respect to the extensive MB case. We also derive, within a classical scheme, an

analytical expression of the elementary cell that can be seen as a macrocell, diﬀerent from the

third power of Planck constant. Thermodynamic quantities like entropy, chemical potential and

free energy of a classical ideal gas, depending on elementary cell, are evaluated. Considering the

fractional deviation from MB distribution we can deduce a physical meaning of the nonextensive

parameter q of the Tsallis nonextensive thermostatistics in terms of particle correlation func-

tions (valid at least in the case, discussed in this work, of small deviations from MB standard case).

INTRODUCTION

Statistical description of a system of N particles requires the subdivision of the phase

space into equidimensional elementary cells of phase volume ∆ Ω, which can be determined

by the laws of nature (comparison with quantum evaluation of energy state density) and

experimentally measured, for instance, in the low temperature heat capacity of a crystal or

in the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

In the phase space volume of a system of particles described by quantum distribution the

smallest elementary cell is the third power of the Planck constant. For classical particles

the elementary cell is, in principle, undetermined. This is true particularly in the limiting

case of small occupation numbers (when MB distribution is valid) and the phase space

volume of a cell acquires arbitrary values.

The problem of dividing the phase space into ﬁnite cells was solved when a natural way

to derive dimension of elementary cells within MB statistics using energy quantization

was found. However, quantum discontinuity can be lost when dimension of the volume

containing the gas increases and the quantum states become even and even more numerous

[1]. Only the insertion of the Pauli exclusion principle enables us to solve this problem.

Boltzmann’s request of a great number of particles into the cell is usually not veriﬁed (one

particle every 30000 cells in normal conditions)[2]. However, if the number is small, it is

possible to combine many cells and form a greater cell (macrocell) containing more particles

[3].

This paper aims at examing ﬁrst of all how , in the nonextensive thermostatistics (NETS),

the elementary cell diﬀers from the one of the extensive MB case, requiring explicitly that

the number of accessible microstates be the same in both (extensive and nonextensive) phase

spaces and obtain also, within a classical scheme and without quantum arguments, explicit

expressions of the cells. Let us brieﬂy recall that NETS has been developed in the last years

mainly after the works of Tsallis [4, 5] which introduced a generalised entropy, featured by

an entropic parameter q, whose meaning is not fully understood yet (more generally, it can

be deﬁned in terms of ﬂuctuations of intensive quantities like temperature [6, 7, 8]; explicit

analytical expressions of q in terms of physical quantities exist in few cases, like, for instance,

in turbulence problems [9] and in the description of solar plasma [10, 11]).

2

The value of q is not easily given a priori for a given particular system, without comparing

calculations to available experimental results.

The NETS is now applied to a great variety of problems, from genetics and biology to

astrophysics (see ref.s [12] and [13] for a complete list of basic works and applications).

The approach to NETS we are showing in this paper, is based on the analysis of deviations

from standard phase space volume and on a new deﬁnition of elementary cell. This new

approach will probabily provide, in the near future, a better understanding of the meaning

of the parameter q. The validity of our treatment can be extended to statistics diﬀerent from

the Tsallis version of NETS, when complete deformed distribution functions are considered,

and to large deviations from MB phase space volume.

In Section 2, by comparing the number of allowed microstates W0 in the MB extensive phase

space Ω0 and in the deformed phase space Ω, we derive the dimensions of both elementary

cells ∆Ω0 and ∆Ω. The cell ∆Ω results to be smaller than ∆Ω0 (if q < 1) so that, in this
case, the third power of Planck constant is not suitable as the value of ∆Ω0 because h3 is

the smallest cell admissible due to the Heisenberg principle. Otherwise ∆Ω is larger than,

∆Ω0 if q > 1 (h is expressed in units [energy length]).

By considering the nonextensive Tsallis equilibrium (or steady state, or long-term stationary

state of a nonequilibrium system) distribution, we limit ourselves to small deviations, with

q)/2 much smaller than one (we recall that for

the absolute value of the parameter δ = (1

−
1 all the MB results must be recovered).

q

→

We must realize that deviations, although small, are not negligible in those energy islands of

Ω where quantities like, for instance, nuclear reaction rates, rates of atomic processes and of

chemical reactions, electron transport in semiconductors are very sensible to them [10, 14,

15, 16]. In Section 3, we discuss the case of nonextensive classical ideal gas. We compare

our results with those recently derived by several authors, among them see ref.s [17, 18, 19],

and we calculate the entropy, the chemical potential and free energy discussing the results.

We deduce also in Section 4 an interpretation of the parameter q using the calculated phase

volume Ω as a function of fractional deviation, occupied by a nonextensive system of N

classical particles. The physical meaning is derived in terms of particle correlation function.

Conclusions are reported in Section 5.

II. PHASE SPACE VOLUME AND ELEMENTARY CELL

The state of a system of N particles is speciﬁed in the 6 N dimensional phase space (Γ

space). Its volume Ω[nr] can be divided into small cells of volume ∆Ω, so that coordinates

where the second one is the energy NETS average value when deviations are small. Other

distributions, based on other statistics can be used [22, 23]; of course, when deformations are

small, these distributions can be ﬁtted with good approximation by Eq. (2.9). The use of

exact distributions, derived from other generalized statistics is possible at least numerically;

in this work, however, we limit ourselves to consider only the distribution of Eq. (2.9), in

order to simplify the question.

The volumes Ω0 and Ω are diﬀerent in size. ∆Ω0 and ∆Ω are also diﬀerent. We realize

that the diﬀerences could be considered negligible, while their eﬀects seem to be quite

important for the evaluation of several physical quantities. Let us remark that the number

of microstates or discrete events does not change from one space to the other one. Therefore,

we set the equation W = W0, because we want to count the same number of microstates

both in Ω and Ω0. Using the relations reported above in this Section , we can explicitate

the expressions of Ω and ∆Ω after simple calculations. After using the following relations:

We compare (2.21) and (2.22) to (2.23) and (2.24) in the case of small deviations. With

Therefore, the requirements that W = W0 and that the equation of state for NETS classical

systems be correctly expressed also in the small deviations limit imply that the standard

phase space elementary cell be given by the expression (2.25) (we send to Sect. 3 for some

more details).

This elementary cell can indeed be considered a macrocell, particularly if compared to the

value of h3, usually taken as elementary cell. However, this requirement is not a problem,

because of the uncertainty of the classical elementary cell and because Darwin and Fowler [3]

7

showed that macrocells should be used to satisfy Boltzmann requirements of a great average

number of particles in each cell.

To take ∆Ω0 of Eq. (2.25) means to have one particle in each macrocell and, posing ∆Ω0 =

X h3, to have 1/X particles in each microcell h3, i.e. one particle in thousands of cells,

The subdivision of the phase space volume Ω in microcells equal to h3 does not allow the

conservation of the value of the number of permissible microstates, nor the subdivision in a

ﬁxed number of microcells independent on β and q.

Instead of having an elementary cell which does not depend on the Lagrange multiplier β and

is the third power of a universal constant (Planck constant) and the number of elementary

cells forming the total phase space volume depending on the Lagrange multiplier β, we have

an elementary cell which depends on the Lagrange multiplier β (it is a macrocell). We also

have the number of cells depending only on the number of particles N (with these positions

we may satisfy the requirements to conserve the number of accessible microstates both in

extensive and in nonextensive phase volumes Ω0 and Ω and to preserve the correct form of

the equation of state).

III. APPLICATION TO CLASSICAL IDEAL GAS: ENTROPY, CHEMICAL PO-

TENTIAL, FREE ENERGY.

Classical ideal gas model based on nonextensive thermostatistics relations has been the

subject of several studies since the ﬁrst applications of NETS [24, 25]. Classical ideal gas is

8

described by an unperturbed state of a system with long-range interaction and the model

can be solved analytically [17]. In the past the equation of state has been derived within

several schemes along the steps of evolution of NETS: non-normalized [24, 25], normalized

[17], OLM (optimal Lagrange multiplier) [18], incomplete statistics [19, 26, 27], among oth-

ers.

In this Section we show synthetically that the formally correct equation of state (2.23) ob-

tained by means of the exact expression of the distribution (2.10), can be deduced also in

the small deviations case, by taking into account the distribution (2.9) if the macrocells of

Eq. (2.25) and of Eq. (2.28) are taken as elementary cells.

The equation of state speciﬁc for classical ideal gas remains form invariant under nonex-

tensive generalization of thermodynamics. That is, it is valid for all q: P V = N/β∗. This

means that the equation of state of a NETS classical ideal gas is formally equal to that of

extensive statistical mechanics: P V = N/β.

The Lagrange multiplier β∗ previously introduced, associated with the constraint in NETS,

is deﬁned by

β∗ =

kT is a constant depending on q which becomes the Boltzmann constant k for q

From the explicit expression of Zq, Cq and Uq (we do not report it here and we send the

(when q

in the previous Section, by considering a nonextensive classical ideal gas with distribution

function ni of Eq. (2.9) (small deviations from MB distribution), we have calculated that

the equation of state is given by P V = N k T (1

5 δ + 46 δ2) i.e., in the limit of small

deviations we must have β∗ = β/Cδ as it can be easily veriﬁed.

In fact, within the treatment illustrated in the previous Section, we obtain that in the limit

of small deviations and for 3 N δ > 1 the expression of Cq reduces to Cδ if the elementary

cell (macrocell) ∆Ω0 of Eq. (2.25) is assumed.

With the expression of ∆Ω given by (2.28) in place of ∆Ω0 given by (2.25) we obtain that

Zq, Cq and Uq do not explicitly depend on the elementary cell. Zq and Cq do not depend on

cells ∆Ω0 and ∆Ω, respectively. If ∆Ω0 is a constant, like h3, Ω0 does not depend on β, but

only on N and Ω depends on N and q. Instead, if ∆Ω0 has the expression of Eq. (2.25) and

∆Ω is given by Eq. (2.28), then Ω0 is also a function of β and Ω is also a function of β and

q.

Let us now derive one of the thermodynamics quantities depending on ∆Ω, the entropy.

Considering an ideal classical gas, if we increase the number N of one unity adding, at

constant energy and volume, one particle with kinetic energy zero and neglecting all interac-

tions, the number of accessible microstates increases and entropy increases too. Considering

the relation

∆U = T ∆S

P ∆V + µ ∆N ,

(3.14)

−

we obtain that µ must be negative. On the contrary, if repulsive interactions are active, the

incoming particle increases both the energy of the system and the entropy; the system must

spend some energy to return to the initial energy value. Then SB decreases and sometimes

decreases more than the gained quantity because of one more particle in the system. In this

case µ is positive.

Let us now take for ∆Ω0 the deﬁnition of Eq. (2.25). We ﬁnd that for an extensive ideal

classical gas we have µ = 0. This result can be explained because adding one particle at

constant energy and volume the elementary cells decrease their single volumes and the total

work done by the system to diminish the spatial volume of N + 1 cells is k T . Therefore,

from Eq.(3.14) we have

We have already discussed that appreciable fractional deviations are, in general, very small.

Nevertheless, few islands of phase space can give a non negligible contribution to deviation of

quantities calculated within the standard space, like, for instance, rates of nuclear reactions

or atomic processes or rates of chemical reactions. We deﬁne, as usual, the radial correlation

function

(g(r) = 1: perfect gas).

Finally, in the limit of a gas/ﬂuid of N particles, we have found a physical interpretation of

the nonextensive parameter q in terms of the particle correlation function among others (see

Wilk et al [6], Beck [7], Beck and Cohen [8] and Tsallis [29]). It can be considered valid at

least for values of q not too diﬀerent from unity, (small deviations from MB distribution).

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have calculated the phase space volume Ω and the corresponding elementary cell

∆Ω, occupied by N classical, identical particles composing a weakly nonextensive system,

at equilibrium (or in a steady state, or long-term stationary state of a nonequilibrium

system). Both quantities must diﬀer from their extensive MB values Ω0 and ∆Ω0 because

we require that the number W0 of available microstates in the MB extensive phase space

Ω0 equals the number W in the deformed (nonextensive) space: W0 = W . This condition

imposes particular analytical expressions of ∆Ω0 and ∆Ω. The number of elementary cells

results equal to the number of particles N.

The two elementary cells result to be macrocells if compared to the usually taken elementary

cell volume, equal to the third power of the Planck constant , with consequences on the

expression of thermodynamic quantities depending on elementary cell, like, for instance,

the partition function, constant of entropy, chemical potential and free energy.

We have applied results on elementary cell to nonextensive classical gas, recovering known

results (equation of state) in NETS literature where ∆Ω is usually taken equal to h3 or left

undetermined.

We have derived expressions of entropy, chemical potential and free energy and discussed

more deeply the case of chemical potential. Applications to particular systems and physical

cases like nuclear fusion reactions in plasmas and chemical reactions will be reported

elsewhere. Through expressions of Ω and ∆Ω we have calculated fractional deviation from

Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. A physical meaning of the nonextensive Tsallis parameter

q in terms of the correlation function has been derived.

We wish to tank Dr. A.M. Scarfone for critical reading of the manuscript and comments.

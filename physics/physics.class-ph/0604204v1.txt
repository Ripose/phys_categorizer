Abstract

The emission of electromagnetic waves from a system described by the H´enon-Heiles potential is

studied in this work. The main aim being to analyze the behavior of the system when the damping

term is included explicitly into the equations of motion. Energy losses at the chaotic regime and at

the regular regime are compared. The results obtained here are similar to the case of gravitational

waves emission, as long we consider only the energy loss. The main diﬀerence being that in the

present work the energy emitted is explicitly calculated solving the equation of motion without

further approximations. It is expected that the present analysis may be useful when studying the

analogous problem of dissipation in gravitational systems.

INTRODUCTION

A. Motivation

The chief motivation of the present work is trying to better understand the eﬀects of

damping forces (the radiation reaction forces) in radiating systems undergoing chaotic mo-

tions. Our ultimate interest is in gravitational systems, in particular, in the case of radiating

chaotic systems. However, due to the diﬃculties that usually arise during the numerical evo-

lution of equations from Einstein gravity, we start analyzing the electromagnetic analogous

problem and shall use the experience acquired here to be able to circumvent those diﬃculties

in future work dealing with gravitational systems.

In a classical ﬁeld theory, the losses of energy and momenta due to the presence of radia-

tion reaction forces is of fundamental importance to determine the physical properties of the

system. Studies on this subject have been done in electromagnetic systems since Maxwell

has established the foundations of the electromagnetic interaction, and in gravitational sys-

tems just after Einstein has formulated the theory of general relativity. Even though much

progress have been done in both cases, there are still some points to be clariﬁed.

Recent works about emission of gravitational waves from chaotic systems presented sev-

eral interesting features of such systems. However, some important questions remained

without answer. Particularly, the inﬂuence of the damping term to the dynamics of a

chaotic system is not well understood. A diﬃcult point when radiation reaction eﬀects are

considered comes from the necessity to include higher order PN approximation in model

calculations. Levin [1] has shown that at 2.0 PN order, the two body problem with spin is

chaotic, extending previous study of Suzuki and Maeda [2]. Nevertheless, the eﬀects of a

dissipation term become important only with inclusion of 2.5 PN order. So, in order to de-

scribe possible eﬀects of chaotic emission on the detection of gravitational waves, it becomes

important to consider higher order terms (see for example the comments from Cornish [3]

and Hughes [4]).

It has been shown that the amount of energy carried away by gravitational waves in a

chaotic regime is smaller than in a regular regime [5] (see also [2, 3]). However, this result was

obtained by brute force method, because in Newtonian gravity, the emission of gravitational

waves is dynamically unimportant, and in these works the energy emission was considered

2

at Newtonian approximation. Thus, knowing the exact manner in which the emission of

gravitational waves in a chaotic system is aﬀected by the damping term is still an open

question. The way to ﬁnd the answer to this question is not as straightforward as we might

naively think. In Einstein gravity, a damping term appears explicitly into the equations of

motion for a test particle just after some type of approximation is performed. The exact

form of the dissipation term depends not only on the coordinate system chosen, but depends

also on the approximation technique used. This is a consequence of the non-linearity of

the equations of motion. Moreover, the problem of gravitational radiation reaction usually

involves enormously complicated calculations and are full of potential sources of errors which

may lead to results whose physical meaning is diﬃcult to be established.

On the other hand, the analogous problem of the electromagnetic radiation reaction is

far easier to be analyzed and quite well understood. Much work on the subject has been

done since the pioneering papers by Lorentz [6] and Planck [7]. The relativistic version of

the radiation reaction force was derived by Abraham [8] and lately by Dirac [9], and we

can say that the eﬀects of radiation reaction force on an accelerated particle, as a classi-

cal ﬁeld theory in special relativity, is very well understood (see, e.g., [10] and references

therein). The generalization of Dirac’s result to curved spacetimes was done by DeWitt

and Brehme [11], and by Hobbs [12]. When considering the quantum theory, the classical

electromagnetic radiation reaction force is also soundly based, since it can be obtained by

taking the appropriate limit of a particular quantum electrodynamical process [13]. For

instance, the position of a linearly accelerated charged particle in the Lorentz-Dirac theory

is reproduced by the ¯h

0 limit of the one-photon emission process in QED (See [14] and

−→

Refs. therein). However, the study of chaotic radiating electromagnetic systems found in the

literature refers mostly to quantum properties of such systems. Its classical counterpart was

not investigated perhaps because the radiation reaction is really important in microscopic

systems.

The similarity between the Abraham-Lorentz theory and the equations appearing in some

approximation schemes from the general relativistic analogous problem of a radiating gravi-

tational system (see e. g. Ref. [15]), and the simplicity of the electromagnetic case compared

to the gravitational case, makes interesting to deepen the study on this subject. Therefore,

we perform here the analysis of the eﬀects of radiation reaction forces considering a classical

electromagnetic chaotic system, and in a future work we investigate the gravitational case.

3

We expect that the comparison of the results from the present work to future works consid-

ering gravitational systems, although diﬀerent in characteristics, shed some light helping to

better understand the gravitational radiation damping problem, particularly in chaotic sys-

tems (see e.g. [16] for the comparison among electromagnetic and gravitational non-chaotic

damped systems).

B. The problem

In order to investigate the eﬀects of radiation reaction on the dynamics of an electro-

magnetic chaotic system, we consider a charged test particle (it can be a macroscopic test

particle) of mass m and charge q submitted to an external electrostatic ﬁeld. In such a case,

the non-relativistic motion of the test particle is governed by the equation [17, 18]

m

= ~Fext + τq

d ~Fext

(1)

where ~Fext denotes the external force acting on the charged particle,
(convective) time derivative of the external force, and τq = 2q2/(3mc3) is the characteristic

dissipation time, which indicates how eﬃcient is the energy emission. The last term of the

above equation is the particle self-force which arises due to the emission of electromagnetic

radiation, and is interpreted as a dissipative force. Accordingly, the names damping term,

or dissipation term are also used.

The derivation of Eq.

(1), and of its relativistic version, with some applications and

with the interpretation of the dissipation term (and, in particular, of the parameter τ ) can

be found in the classical textbooks [10, 19]. In fact, in the original derivation by Lorentz

[6] and Planck [7] (the relativistic version was derived by Abraham [8] and Dirac [9]) the
resulting equation of motion is m~a = ~Fext + mτq (d~a/dt), which leads to runaway solutions.

A way to avoid such a type of solutions is by replacing the time derivative of the particle’s
acceleration d~a/dt by the time derivative of the external force, m(d~a/dt) = d ~Fext/dt, into

this equation, what yields Eq. (1) as a ﬁrst approximation to the equation of motion for a

[18] claims that Eq. (1)
charged particle. A deeper analysis, however, performed in Ref.
is the correct equation of motion for a charged particle submitted to an external force ~Fext

(see also Refs. [20, 21]).

4

A further well known property of Eq. (1) is that, for motions within a time interval ∆t

such that ∆t

τq, the radiative eﬀects on the dynamics of the system will be negligible, and

≪

the last term in Eq. (1) can be neglected. Thus, in order for the eﬀects of the damping term

to be noticeable, the time of observation must be large compared to τq. This is equivalent to

say that the eﬀects of dissipation will be important only for situations in which the external

force is applied for a time interval ∆t much larger than the dissipation time τq, ∆t

τq.

≫

These conditions were both taken into account in our simulations (see Sec. II B). Hence, the

system we are analyzing here can be interpreted as the analogous to the case of an orbiting

test body in a weak gravitational ﬁeld, but considering explicitly the damping term.

C. The structure of the paper

In the following section we write explicitly the equations of motion for a test charged

particle in the H´enon-Heiles potential, by assuming a non relativistic motion. Sec. III is

dedicated to report the numerical results and to their analysis. A brief analysis on the

relativistic particle motion is done in Sec. IV, and ﬁnally in Sec. V we conclude by making

a few remarks and ﬁnal comments.

II. H´ENON-HEILES SYSTEMS

A. The model

We consider an external force ~Fext derived from a H´enon-Heiles electrostatic potential

[22], and work in a non-relativistic regime where Eq. (1) holds (for a relativistic version of

Eq. (1) see [18, 20]; see also Sec. IV). The choice of such a potential was due mainly to

its simplicity allied to its dynamical richness, implying for instance chaotic motions, what

is of capital importance in our analysis. Other interesting point to be mentioned is that

a potential of the same type was used in a previous work which analyzed the emission of

gravitational waves [5] instead electromagnetic waves, and so the results of the two works

can be compared. H´enon-Heiles systems are described by a potential of the form

V (x, y) = mω2 x2 + y2

and have been considered in several contexts [23] beyond the original astrophysical scenario.

This potential is basically a perturbed two-dimensional harmonic oscillator. Therefore, ω

may be identiﬁed with the oscillatory frequency which, in the absence of the perturbation

term, is ω =

k/m, k being a spring constant, for a mechanical system or ω =

system (in CGS-Gaussian units). Parameter a is the characteristic length of the system.
The characteristic frequency ω deﬁnes a characteristic period of motion, T = ω−1.

Without the damping term, and with the usual choice of units [22], m = ω = a = 1,

and in our case also Q = q = 1 (see below), the chaoticity of the H´enon-Heiles system is
controlled only by its energy E: the system is bound if E <
∼

1/6, being mostly regular for

the energy range from 0 to nearly 1/10, and being mostly chaotic for E in the range 1/10

to 1/6.

In the presence of the damping term, the dynamics of a charged point particle under

action of the potential given by equation (2) is governed by the equations

Here, working with electromagnetic ﬁeld and using Eqs. (3) and (4), we considered the

eﬀects of radiation damping, comparing long term energy loss between chaotic and regular

regimes. The energy loss being considered directly into the equations of motion without

further approximations. The main results are reported and analyzed in Sec. III.

B. Units and normalized parameters

We present here a discussion about the physical parameters of the present H´enon-Heiles

electromagnetic system. However, let us stress once more that the present model is to be

considered a toy model, as a laboratory test for our procedures, and not as a test for the

electromagnetic theory.

Eqs. (3) and (4) have three free parameters characteristic to the system under consider-

ation: The constant a, the characteristic time τq, and the frequency ω. Then we follow the

standard procedure and choose a new normalized time parameter τ and a new normalized

time variable t given respectively by the relations τ = τq

ω, and t = t(s)

ω, where τq and

t(s) carry dimensions, while τ and t are dimensionless parameters. The constant a, which

carries dimensions of length, is used to normalize the variables x and y. The usual choice is

to measure x and y in units of a, which is equivalent to replace a = 1 into the equations of

motion.

noticeable.

As far as the eﬀects of dissipation are concerned, the important parameter is the rational-

ized characteristic time τ . The contribution of the radiation reaction force to the dynamics

of the system is proportional to τ (see Eq. 1). Therefore, the value to be chosen for τ has

to be as large as possible. On the other hand, as shown below, the time of observation (the

computation time) has to be much larger than τ in order for the eﬀects of dissipation being

when the test particle is an electron, in which case one has τq

q/m is not ﬁxed and τq may assume values several orders of magnitude larger than τe. For a
charged test body such that q = αe and m = βme one has τq = (α2/β)τe. Take, for instance,

Regarding to the third parameter of the model, the characteristic frequency ω, one sees

that it depends also upon the source of the H´enon-Heiles potential, being a typical period

of the system. For an electromagnetic system it is related to the total charge Q of the

source by a relation of the form, mω2 = Qq/a3, m and q being respectively the mass and

the electric charge of the test particle, and a being the characteristic length of the system

mentioned above. As usual in H´enon-Heiles systems, we are free to ﬁx ω as an inverse time

unit, ω = ωq, in such a way that τ = τqωq. Thus, if the source of the potential has mass

m = βme and net electric charge q = αe, we have

τ = τqωq =

τeωq .

(5)

Therefore, if we think of a speciﬁc orbiting particle (τq ﬁxed), diﬀerent values of the dis-

sipation parameter mean diﬀerent values for ωq, which gives the corresponding physical

parameters of the H´enon-Heiles potential.

Now we are ready to ﬁx the parameters and to establish some constraints to the physical

size of our system. Let us consider a system with typical size L (which is essentially of the

7

order of the parameter a mentioned above). Being ω−1

range describes both the microscopic and the macroscopic systems.

One more issue on the subject of ﬁxing parameters concerns the physical properties of

the source in the H´enon-Heiles system. Namely, the electric charge Q and the characteristic

length a. As we have seen above, these are related to the characteristic frequency ωq, and

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS

A. Methodology

Equations (3) and (4) were solved numerically. For the sake of comparison, we initially

used two diﬀerent numerical methods: a fourth order Runge-Kutta with ﬁxed stepsize and

a Runge-Kutta with adaptive stepsize [24]. Also, we used MATHEMATICA built-in proce-

dures for solving Ordinary Diﬀerential Equations.

At ﬁrst, we integrated Eqs. (3) and (4) considering no dissipation term, i.e., with τ = 0.

The initial conditions were generated at random, ﬁxing only initial energy and choosing

x = 0 at the start. Since in this case the system is conservative, the energy is a constant of

motion, and its value was used to check and compare the numerical results obtained through

diﬀerent methods. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed, so we adopted a fourth order

Runge-Kutta in our simulations.

B. Numerical simulations

The main concern of this work is answering the question: How does the value of the

dissipation time τ aﬀect the dynamics of system? In particular, we also want to know

how much energy is radiated by the accelerated particle undergoing chaotic motions in

comparison to regular motions. It is expected that a large value of τ will strongly aﬀect the

dynamics, in opposition to small values, for which the dynamics of the system should be

weakly aﬀected. Nonetheless, it remains to be deﬁned what values of τ can be considered

large and what are small ones. For comparison we made simulations for several diﬀerent

values of τ and same initial conditions. After a few tries, we have chosen ﬁve particular
cases to analyze in more detail. The chosen values are τ = 0, 10−4, 10−6, 10−8, and 10−10,

with initial energy E = 0.12 and the same initial conditions for all of the ﬁve cases.

The results can be seen in Fig. 1, where we plot the Poincar´e sections for each value of τ .

Each one of the graphs represents the resulting section for only one orbit, corresponding to
the particular initial conditions we have chosen. Notice that except for τ = 10−4, all other
10−4 or greater are to be considered

Poincar´e sections look very similar, suggesting that τ
large values, and τ is to considered small if its value is of the order of 10−6 or below.

The results are seen in Fig. 2 where we plot the graphics of ∆E

that these graphs are the actual data points, and not ﬁts adjusting the data. For instance,

the lines appearing in the ﬁrst four graphs of that ﬁgure are the result of plotting the set

of points obtained numerically for each one of the particular orbits chosen to be analyzed.

Such straight lines indicate that energy emission rate is constant, and that the total energy

of the system decreases linearly with time. This is so for small dissipation times τ , while

for higher values of τ the energy loss rate is not constant with time (see Fig. 3).

seen that for τ = 0 the variations in the energy are exceedingly small (

It is

look like random variations. This is surely not an eﬀect of dissipation, because the total

energy dissipated during the integration time is essentially zero. These random variations

are caused by numerical inaccuracy, as it can be inferred by comparing this to the other

cases with τ
= 0, where the energy variations are much larger and systematic, causing the
energy to decrease monotonically with time. For instance, for τ = 10−4 the total energy

dissipated during the integration time reaches nearly 20 % of the initial value, so that at time

see they cause the energy of the system to decrease monotonically with time.

As a further example of a large (higher) τ value, we performed simulations with τ = 10−3

and with energy E = 0.12, and the results are seen in Fig. 3. The large graphics shows the

percent variations of the energy, and the small graph is the Poincar´e section for this special

orbit. Due to the large dissipation parameter, the motion is highly damped and, after some

time, rest is attained. At time t = 2000 nearly 90% of the initial energy has been carried

away by electromagnetic radiation. Note also that the amount of energy emitted does not

vary linearly with time, as it happens for smaller values of τ .

For our purposes here, high values of τ , τ >
∼

10−4, say, are not interesting because the

dynamics of the system is highly aﬀected and the comparison to the case without dissipation
becomes diﬃcult (if not impossible) to be done. Then, we considered only τ = 10−6, τ =
10−8, and τ = 10−10 in our full simulations.

Once ﬁxed the values of τ , the next step was solving numerically Eqs. (3) and (4) with

several initial conditions, and for the energy values E = 0.12 and E = 0.14. A set of

500 distinct initial conditions was generated using a (pseudo) random number generator

[25], and the same set was used for every combination of the controlled parameters, τ

Although we performed simulations also for E = 0.09 and E = 0.10, the respective results

were not considered in our analysis. In such cases, the number of chaotic motions (typically

less than 10 in 500 simulations) in our set of results was too small for a good statistics, and

so they would not be useful in comparing chaotic to regular regimes, which is the basic aim

of the present work.

C. Results and analysis

Using the results of our simulations, we constructed Poincar´e section for each case, all

of them being drawn on the surface x = 0 in phase space. These sections were analyzed

in order to separate between dynamics with chaotic motions from dynamics with regular

motions.

The graphics in Fig. 4 are Poincar´e sections obtained for E = 0.12, without damping
term (τ = 0), and with dissipation term for τ = 10−10, τ = 10−8, and τ = 10−6, as indicated

in each plot. Although the overall aspects are the same, a detailed analysis of individual

sections reveals diﬀerent aspects as seen in Fig. 5, where we plot Poincar´e sections for

particular orbits corresponding to three diﬀerent sets of initial conditions for each value of

τ . Here a very important result is that with the inclusion of a small damping term, the

13

FIG. 5: Poincar´e sections for E = 0.12 and four distinct values of τ , but with the same initial

conditions, are shown at the same horizontal level. The corresponding τ values appear on top of

each column.

overall aspect of motions are the same, and in particular, the energy is nearly constant, so

that Poincar´e section is still a good tool in order to classify the motions as regular or chaotic.

From this ﬁgure it is also seen the dependence of the dynamics on the initial conditions,

besides the dependence upon τ . It is also worth saying that a few particular orbits, out of

the 500 initially chosen, were neglected since it was not clear from the obtained Poincar´e

sections whether they correspond to regular or chaotic motions (see Table I).

Now with our set of simulations already separated into two sets, one set with ordered

motions only and the other set with chaotic ones, we calculated for each initial condition

(in each set) a best linear ﬁt to the energy variations ∆E = At + B, determining A and

B by using standard techniques of linear regression. Then, with such a set of values for A

and B we determined the mean values < A > and < B >, and their respective standard

deviations, σA and σB, for each regime of motions. The results are summarized in Table

I, where we show just the values of < A > and σA. These are more important than the

values of < B > and σB, because they furnish the (time) rate of energy carried away by

electromagnetic waves. We also show in that table (last column), the resulting number of

regular and chaotic motions for each pair of values of the initial energy and dissipation time.

TABLE I: Mean values of the energy loss rates < A >, and the standard deviations σA for each

energy and τ values. The last column shows the number of motions in each particular regime.

As mentioned above, some orbits are missing because they could not be classiﬁed as regular

nor as chaotic ones.

With the obtained data, we compared the amount of energy radiated in regular regimes

with respect to chaotic regimes, and calculated the percent ratio η as follows

where the subscript C stands for chaotic and subscript R, for regular. This is shown in

Table II.

In all cases the average energy radiated in regular regimes is larger than in

chaotic regimes. These results are compatible with what was obtained when considering

gravitational waves emission [2, 5] (see also [1, 3]).

IV. RELATIVISTIC MOTION

We have also investigated the behavior of the electromagnetic H´enon-Heiles system in

relativistic dynamics. In such a case we solved the equations [10, 18]

(3) and (4), were used in the numerical calculations.

The numerical results obtained from the relativistic equation (8) were essentially the same

as in the non-relativistic case. This can be understood noticing that for the bound system

the particle undergoes a non-relativistic motion, as can be veriﬁed by the following facts.

In the H´enon-Heiles potential (2), for the test particle to acquire velocities comparable to

the velocity of light, its initial energy E has to be large. In the rationalized units used here,

this means E

1. However, as shown in Ref. [22], if E is larger than 1/6 the system is not

∼

bound, and then in the regime where relativistic eﬀects become important the particle is not

bound by the H´enon-Heiles potential. Therefore, the relativistic regime is not important in

the present analysis.

V. FINAL REMARKS

Our results show that when we consider explicitly the eﬀects of radiation reaction force,

the energy emission through electromagnetic waves in the chaotic regime is smaller than in

the regular regime, as it was obtained in the case of emission of gravitational waves.

The ratio of energy loss in regular compared to chaotic motions increases with the initial

energy of the system, and decreases with the dissipation parameter. Since in H´enon-Heiles

systems the chaoticity increases with the energy, this means that the ratio between the

energy emitted in regular motions and in chaotic motions grows with the chaoticity of the

system.

We recall that, in the gravitational waves case, the simulations were performed at PN

approximation lower than 2.5PN. The result was that the eﬀect of gravitational waves emis-

sion is negligible to the dynamics of the system. However, being PN lower than 2.5, in those

simulations the eﬀects of radiation emission were in fact not fully considered. In our analysis

of the electromagnetic H´enon-Heiles system, these eﬀects are fully considered through the

radiation reaction force. Another important result is related to the mean life-time of source.

If we make a prediction considering only regular dynamics its mean life-time may be shorter

than the prediction from chaotic dynamics. However, in the case of dissipation by emission

of gravitational radiation a more careful analysis has to be done.

The numerical procedures and analysis performed in this work will certainly be useful in

our task of studying the gravitational analogous problem, the one about the gravitational ra-

diation emitted by a particle undergoing chaotic motion, considering explicitly the damping

term into the equations of motion (work on this subject is in progress).

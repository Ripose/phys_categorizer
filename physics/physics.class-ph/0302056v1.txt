The existence of symmetries in a physical system means that there exists one
or more transformations that leave the physical system unaltered. Since physical
systems can be completely described by their Lagrangians / Hamiltonians, it is therefore
natural to expect the symmetry transformations to be canonical ones. The number
of symmetry transformations that can be generated from the system depends on the
number of conserved quantities of the associated system. It has been well-known that
the conserved quantities of a physical systems relate closely to the generator of the
associated symmetry transformations [1, 2, 7].

It has been well-known for many years of the history of modern physics that
symmetry principles and conservation laws play a crucial role in understanding physical
phenomena [1, 2, 3]. Many physical problems can be solved signiﬁcantly easier by taking
into account symmetry consideration, and most importantly, one can gain deep insight of
the nature of the phenomena. Many ﬁelds of study in modern physics developed rapidly
through the understanding of symmetry principles, for instance, the gauge symmetries
in quantum ﬁeld theory and elementary particle physics [4, 5, 6].

In this paper, we shall discuss the derivation of all possible conserved quantities
associated with a given physical system. We shall limit our task on classical mechanics,
although it may be possible to extend the derivation techniques to quantum mechanics
and ﬁeld theories, once the connection between classical and quantum systems is
established via canonical realizations [1, 8]. The one-, two- and three-dimensional
cases will be considered whenever possible, as well as the time-independent and time-
dependent cases.

The paper is organized as follows : a brief overview of classical mechanics is given in
Section 2, in which we shall use Lagrangian and Hamiltonian approaches. This includes
a brief review of canonical transformations, especially a subset of the transformations
called inﬁnitesimal canonical transformations. The relation between symmetry canonical
transformations and conservation laws, as well as the general technique to obtain the
conserved quantities are given in Section 3. In Section 4, we shall discuss the derivation
of conserved quantities in one-, two- and three- dimensional cases associated with time-
independent systems. A similar discussion for time-dependent cases is given in Section 5.
Some examples are used to check the validity of the formulation. Section 6 presents
summary and conclusion of the discussion, as well as a brief remark of the extension
possibility of the techniques to quantum systems and ﬁeld theories.

2. Classical Mechanics : Canonical Formalism.

A classical system can always be represented by an associated Lagrangian L(qi, ˙qi, t)
that satisﬁes

and leads to Euler-Lagrange equations of motions

where i = 1...N, N = number of degrees of freedom.

Deﬁning the conjugate momenta pi associated with the canonical coordinates qi as

we can construct a new function H(qi, pi, t) that can equivalently represent the physical
system as L(qi, ˙qi, t) via Legendre transformation [7] :

H(qi, pi, t) is known as Hamiltonian. Using Eqs. (II.2) and (II.4), a set of equations of
motion equivalent to Eq. (II.2) (the Hamilton’s equations of motion) can be obtained
as follows :

which preserves Eq. (II.5) is called canonical transformations.
It is easy to show
that the set of canonical transformations forms a non-abelian group [1], and that the
transformations can be generated by one of the four types of generating functions
F1(qi, Qi, t), F2(qi, Pi, t), F3(pi, Qi, t), F4(pi, Pi, t) [7]. The old Hamiltonian H(qi, pi, t)
and the new counterpart K(Qi, Pi, t) are related by

K(Qi, Pi, t) = H(qi, pi, t) +

forms, which leads to diﬀerent physical
interpretations.

The ﬁrst two equations in Eq. (II.5) can be written as

In the case of canonical transformations, it is easy to show that the necessary and
suﬃcient condition for the transformation (II.6) to be canonical is

We are now focusing our attention to a subset of canonical transformations that
lies at the neighborhood of identity transformation, namely the inﬁnitesimal canonical
transformations. The transformation can be generated by the following generating
function [7]

F2(qi, Pi, t) =

(qjPj + ǫjfj(qi, pi, t)) ,

(II.11)

where f (qi, pi, t) is the generator of inﬁnitesimal canonical transformation, and ǫ is an
inﬁnitesimal parameter. The transformation generated by (II.11) can be written as

It can be shown that the set of inﬁnitesimal canonical transformations forms an abelian
group, and hence it can be used to form a linear vector space and an algebra [9]. The
algebra of inﬁnitesimal canonical transformation satisﬁes the following Poisson bracket
relation [1, 8] :

where C k
ij and dij are constants depending on the nature of the transformation. In some
transformations, the constant dij may be removed by a suitable substitution [1, 8]. The
relation (II.13) are closely related to the commutation relation in Lie algebras [10].

3. Symmetries, Conservation Laws and General Conserved Quantities.

The inﬁnitesimal canonical transformation (II.12) that leaves the Hamiltonian of a
given physical system invariant is called the symmetry canonical transformation of
the associated system. The term invariant means that the nature of the physical
system is unaltered by the transformation, which means that the old and transformed
Hamiltonians have to be of the same functional forms. As the consequence, Eq. (II.7)
can be written in the form of

H(Qi, Pi, t) = H(qi, pi, t) +

∂F2
∂t
Inserting Eqs. (II.11) and (II.12) into Eq. (III.14) and applying Taylor expansion on the
H(Qi, Pi, t) to the ﬁrst order of ǫi together with Eqs. (II.8) and (II.9), we get

(III.14)

,

(qi, pi, t) =

{

}

∂fj
∂t

(III.15)

which means that fj(qi, pi, t) are the conserved quantities of the given physical system.
Hence there is a closed relation between the existence of conserved quantity and its
associated symmetry canonical transformation.

We may obtain the conserved quantities fj(qi, pi, t) associated with a given physical
system by solving Eq. (III.15), which lead to the constructions of its associated symmetry
canonical transformations according to Eq. (II.12). Since Eq. (III.15) is a linear partial
diﬀerential equation of the ﬁrst order, the following theorem provides the general
solutions of the equation [11, 12] :

(III.17)

then the relation Φ(u1, ..., un) = 0 (where Φ is arbitrary function) is a general solution
of Eq. (III.16).

A rigorous proof of Theorem 1 is given in Ref. [12]. It should be noted that there are a
maximum of n independent solutions satisfying Eq. (III.17).

As the consequences of Theorem 1, the general solution of Eq. (III.15) may be

written as

fj(qi, pi, t) = ˜Φ(u1, ..., u2n),

This means that every independent solution of the subsidiary equation (III.19) is
also conserved quantity of the associated physical system. The maximum number of
independent solutions depends on the number of conﬁguration degrees of freedom, which
can be interpreted as the maximum number of all independent conserved quantities one
can possibly ﬁnd in the system.

quantity from a time-dependent physical system, since the ∂H

explicit time-dependence. The maximum number of possible independent conserved
quantities is 2n
It should be note that Eq. (IV.21) admits a trivial solution
f (qi, pi) = H(qi, pi), and hence f (qi, pi) = Φ(H(qi, pi)). This kind of solutions will
be automatically satisﬁed in any time-independent case.

We shall use Eqs. (IV.22) and (IV.23) to re-derive time-independent conserved

quantities of free particle and central force systems in 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional cases.

4.1. Free Particle Systems.

The simplest free particle system is the 1-dimensional free particle system, whose
Hamiltonian is given by

H(q, p) =

where ¯Φ, Φ are arbitrary functions. This indicates that the conserved quantities in 1-
dimensional free particle system must be functions of momentum. This includes the
trivial solution H(p), which is the function of momentum only.

For the 2-dimensional case, the Hamiltonian can be written as

The general solution of Eq. (IV.21) of the system is

Eq. (IV.30) shows that there are 3 independent solutions, correspond to 3 independent
conserved quantities, i.e, momenta in x and y directions and the angular momentum in
z direction. The trivial solution H(q, p) can be expressed in term of px and py only.

and the general solution of Eq. (IV.21) of the system is

(IV.35)

From Eq. (IV.34), we have 5 independent solutions correspond to momenta in x, y and z
directions, as well as angular momenta in x and y directions. The angular momentum in
qypx can be expressed as the function of 5 independent conserved

non-trivial solutions associated with the angular momentum in x, y and z directions.
Again, there may be 5 independent solutions obtained in some 3-dimensional systems.
The general solution of Eq. (IV.21) for the 3-dimensional central force system is then

f (q, p) = ¯Φ (H(q, p), Lx, Ly, Lz) .

(IV.45)

5. Time-dependent Conserved Quantities.

In the time-dependent case, Eq. (III.15) must be fully satisﬁed. There are two kinds of
conserved quantities : one associated with time-independent Hamiltonian, and another
one associated with time-dependent one. With the time-independent Hamiltonian,
Eq. (III.15) still admits the trivial solution H(q, p), which means the total energy of
the physical system is still conserved, as well as time-indepedent solutions. With the
time-dependent Hamiltonian, this is no longer the case.

The subsidiary equation of Eq. (III.15) is given by Eq. (III.19), with the maximum
number of its independent solutions is 2n. We shall use Eqs. (III.18) and (III.19) to
derive time-dependent conserved quantities of time-independent Hamiltonians, with free
particle and central force systems as the examples, as well as time-dependent conserved
quantities associated with a time-dependent Hamiltonian. We shall only discuss the
one-dimensional physical systems since the calculation diﬃculties arise in 2- and 3-
dimensional cases.

5.3. Time-dependent Physical Systems

As mentioned in the beginning of Section 5, in the time-dependent physical systems
the the Hamiltonians are no longer conserved quantities, meaning that the subsidiary
equations Eq. (III.19) do not have the Hamiltonians as ones of their solutions.

Given the Hamiltonian of a 1-dimensional physical system as

+ V (q, t),

H(q, p, t) =

p2

the subsidiary equations (III.19) may be expressed as

where we have used partial derivative of V (q, t) instead of total derivative as in
Eq. (V.54).

As in the central force cases, the treatment of obtaining solutions for Eq. (V.63)
depends on the functional forms of the associated potentials. For the purpose of
demonstration, let us consider a simple 1-dimensional system of a point mass m attached
to a spring of constant k, where the other end of the spring is ﬁxed on a massless cart
moving uniformly along q axis with speed v0
. The potential of the system is given by

Inserting potential (V.64) into Eq. (V.63), we have

V (q, t) =

6. Summary and Conclusion.

We have discussed the way of obtaining conserved quantities of a given physical system
by solving Eq. (III.15) using the subsidiary equations (III.19). The maximum number
of possible conserved quantities a physical system may have is given by Theorem 1.
Some particular time-independent as well as time-dependent cases have been used to
demonstrate the technique and treatment of handling Eq. (III.19). For the same physical
systems, it is found that one may not have the same results for the time-independent
and time-dependent cases. More complicated treatment may be used to deal with time-
dependent cases.

Although the technique presented here is in the scope of classical mechanics, it is
applicable to classical ﬁelds, provided that the Poisson brackets in Eq. (III.15) is re-
formulated in an appropriated way in terms of ﬁeld variables [1, 7]. Also, since the
connection between classical and quantum mechanics can be established by replacing
the Poisson brackets with Lie brackets or commutators, the conserved quantities in
quantum mechanics may be obtained directly by replacing (q, p) in the associated
classical quantities with (q, ¯h
i

∂
∂q ).

As the existence of non-trivial conserved quantities in classical mechanics yields
the symmetries of the physical system, the same argument is true for quantum system.
Moreover, the existence of symmetries in quantum mechanics generates degeneracy.
For example, since there is no non-trivial conserved quantity in time-independent
one dimensional harmonic oscillator, there is no degeneracy occurred in the quantum
counterpart. The degeneracy of harmonic oscillator system shows up in 2- and 3-
dimensional cases.

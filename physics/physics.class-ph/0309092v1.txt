Alternative potentials for the electromagnetic ﬁeld

Shaun N. Mosley, Alumni, University of Nottingham NG7 2RD , England

Abstract

The electromagnetic ﬁeld can be expressed in terms of two complex potentials α, β , which are

related to the Debye potentials. The evolution equations for α, β are derived, which are separable

either in parabolic coordinates (leading to the radiation ﬁelds) or in radial coordinates (multipole

ﬁelds). Potentials corresponding to focused wave ﬁelds as well as plane waves are discussed. A

conserved radiation density can be constructed in terms of these potentials, which is positive

(negative) for positive (negative) helicity radiation.

I. INTRODUCTION

The source-free electromagnetic ﬁeld has only two degrees of freedom per space-time point. Some

economy is achieved by reducing the six components of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds (E, B) to
the usual 4 potentials (Φ, A) which satisfy the covariant Lorentz condition ∂tΦ + ∇
Φ component may be dispensed with provided that the three potentials A satisfy the non-covariant
Coulomb gauge ∇
A = 0 . The most economical way to express the two degrees of freedom of the
free electromagnetic ﬁeld is in terms of the two real Debye potentials1,2 (ψ1, ψ2) . Here we introduce
from which the electromasgnetic ﬁeld can be derived via (8)
a pair of complex potentials

A = 0 , or the

the diﬀerence of positive and negative helicity radiation can be constructed, they accomodate

singularities in the ﬁeld (charged particles), and interesting focused wave solutions arise naturally

when solving the evolution equations (equation (A7)below).

The standard text-books may not refer to the Debye potentials by that name3, but use either ψ
or L2ψ in their analysis of multipole radiation ﬁelds, where ψ are spherical solutions of the wave
equation - see for example pp.432-433 of Reitz4, or pp.745-746 of Jackson5. The paper by Boukamp
and Casimir6 discusses of the various essentially equivalent approaches to multipole radiation, while

(5a, b)

Despite the fact that the two Debye potentials (or the single complex Debye potential ψ )

precisely contain the two degrees of freedom of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, they are seldom used

outside magnetostatics and multipole ﬁeld analysis. Some disadvantages spring to mind:

(a) the ﬁeld F
E+iB is expressed by second order diﬀerential operators acting on the potentials,
so then for example the usual energy density of the ﬁeld (F∗ F) is a cumbersome expression in

≡

terms of ψ ,

(b) there is no regular closed form potential ψ representing a plane wave ﬁeld. The standard
texts9 express the plane wave potential as an inﬁnite sum over l of the spherical harmonics Yl,±1 ,
although this actually represents plane waves outgoing in each direction from the (θ = π/2) plane,

(c) the Debye potential formalism is ill suited to coping with point singularities representing charged

particles in the ﬁeld, i.e. there is no regular potential ψ representing the monopole ﬁeld at the

origin, as can be seen immediately from (4). See Ref.1 for irregular potentials ψ representing the

We will now show that, given (3), the ﬁeld F can be expressed in terms of two complex potentials

α, β acted on by ﬁrst order diﬀerential operators. These potentials (α, β) admit charged particle

solutions, for static and moving charges, and the potentials representing the plane wave ﬁelds are

We now ﬁnd the potentials

corresponding to the radiation ﬁelds. Equations (11)

(cid:9)

(cid:8)

enable us to calculate the potentials for a known ﬁeld - which approach we follow in this section.

Alternatively we can look for solutions of the evolution equations for the potentials (13), satisfying

the constraint (9) - which approach we take in appendix A. It turns out that these evolution

equations (13) are separable in either spherical or parabolic coordinates - the spherical solutions

yield the potentials corresponding to the multipole ﬁelds (which are singular at the origin), while

the parabolic solutions are potentials for non-singular ﬁelds, including the plane wave ﬁelds.

III. THE CONSERVED DENSITY ρ AND THE ENERGY E

A. The radiation density ρ .

The electromagnetic ﬁeld is the classical “ﬁrst-quantized” version of the massless spin-1 photon

ﬁeld, and as such should have a conserved density corresponding to the well-known densities for
the Klein-Gordon (spin-zero) or Dirac (spin- 1
2 ) ﬁelds. The only text on classical (non-quantized)
electromagnetism which discusses a radiation density, or an inner product, for the electromagnetic
ﬁeld that I have come across is the book by Good and Nelson,12 otherwise one has to turn to
texts on QED such as that by Schweber.13 For an excellent recent review on this subject, see

Ref. 14. This inner product for the electromagnetic ﬁeld involves the non-local (integral) operator

V. OUTLOOK

We have calculated the potentials

corresponding to various ﬁelds: the simple relation (9)

between the potentials and the radial ﬁeld Fr makes the calculation of the potential from a given
ﬁeld quite straightforward, or one can solve the equations for the potentials from which one then

}

calculates the ﬁeld, as in appendix A. Although

are scalars under rotations, they have

complicated transformation properties under the Lorentz transformations - we will discuss these

transformation properties elsewhere. (For the Lorentz transformation of the Debye potential ψ ,
also complicated, see the paper by Monroe.19) The stationary solutions for the potentials with time
dependence e−ikt (e+ikt ) correspond to the left (right) circularly polarized waves: the orthogonal-

For the negative x3 axis λ = 0 and µ =
x3 , and we obtain the same expression (A8) for the
ﬁeld along the negative x3 axis. Along the x3 axis the ﬁeld FZ appears as a right-circularly
−1/2 from
polarized plane wave propagating in the +x3 direction, with amplitude decaying by
the origin. Away from the x3 axis the ﬁeld decays more rapidly: the x1, x2 plane through the
origin is parametrized by λ = µ =
2/2 , then substituting λ = µ = ρ into (3.7) one ﬁnds
that the ﬁeld decays by ρ−1 from the origin. Thus the ﬁeld FZ is highly directional along the axis
of propagation.

When m = 1 , c > 1/2 , the resulting ﬁeld becomes inﬁnite at spatial inﬁnity.

Appendix B. Orthonormality of the basis functions U (k)
First we will consider the orthogonality of two left-circularly polarized waves, UL(k) , UL(k′) . Due
to the fact that the UL(k) , UL(k′) are eigenstates of the angular momentum in the direction of
propagation k or k′ , and the L operator is Hermitian, then

So we need only consider the case when the waves are propagating in the same direction but with

Abstract

An explanation of the mechanism of irreversible dynamics was oﬀered. The explana-
tion was obtained within the framework of laws of classical mechanics by the expansion of
Hamilton formalism. Such expansion consisted in adaptation of it to describe of the non-
potential interaction of a systems. The procedure of splitting of a system into equilibrium
subsystems, presentation of subsystem’s energy as the sum of energy of their relative motion
and their internal energy was the basis of the approach which was used for the analysis of
nonequilibrium systems. As a results the generalized Liouville equation and equation of
subsystems interaction was obtained. Based on these equations, the irreversible transfor-
mation of energy of the relative motion of subsystems into their internal energy was proved.
The formula which expresses the entropy via the work of subsystems’ interaction forces was
submitted. The link between classical mechanics and thermodynamics was discussed.

Introduction

Collective properties of natural systems should be connected with laws of dynamics and proper-
ties of their elements. Searching of these connections is among the main tasks of physics. There
are principal diﬃculties in connection with solving of this problem. Particularly they are con-
sisted in absence of links between laws of classical mechanics and laws of the thermodynamics.
The irreversibility problem which was formulated by Boltzmann about 150 years ago is the key
problem among them [1-4]. The essence of this problem is that dynamics of natural systems
is irreversible, while in accordance with Newton equation dynamics of elements of system is
reversible.

Actually all attempts of irreversibility substantiation within the framework of canonical
formalism of Hamilton were somehow or other stricken against Poincare’s theorem about re-
versibility. This theorem forbids the existence of irreversibility within Hamiltonian systems
[5-8].

Study of irreversibility is often based on the Lorentz’s gas model [7-9]. This model represents
point objects with certain masses. They are elastically scattered on various boundaries but do
not interact between each other. Study of Lorentz’s gas allowed to ﬁnd important laws of
behavior of dynamic systems, and mixing is among them. But nevertheless the problem of
irreversibility has remained unsolved. It was stricken against so-called ”coarse grain” of the
phase space problem [8].

At the beginning of our irreversibility investigation we chose the most elementary system -
system of hard disks. Taking collisions of disks among themselves into account was our ﬁrst step
in study of irreversibility. The motion equation of colliding hard disks was obtained. Based on it

1

we found out that forces of interaction of disks systems depend on its relative velocities, i.e. they
are non-potential [10-11]. But in order to study such systems we had to expand the framework
of Hamilton canonical formalism in such a way that it would be possible to use it for description
of dynamics of systems with non-potential forces (polygenic forces [12]). Therefore Lagrange,
Hamilton and Liouville equations for systems with non-potential forces acting between them
were obtained [11, 15]. According to accepted terminology [12], we will call these equations and
system-system interaction forces as ”generalized equations” and ”generalized forces”.

The analysis of generalized Liouville equation led us to conclusion that irreversibility is
possible only for non-potentially interacting systems. Using an equation of disks’ motion and
generalized Liouville equation we were succeeded in showing of existence of irreversible dynamics
for the nonequilibrium system of disks which is presented in the form of two colliding subsystems.
It was found out that the irreversibility is determined by decreasing of generalized forces [11].
The generality of results of researches of disks systems is limited to a condition of their
absolute rigidity. Moreover, a series of assumptions at the proof of irreversibility have been
used. It has essentially simpliﬁed the proof of irreversibility for systems of the disks. Therefore
for generalization of these results on a real systems it was necessary to ﬁnd such approach which
would allow to remove the restriction connected with these assumptions and assumption about
non-potentiality forces between elements of the system.

For this purpose we took into account that the presence of dependence of the systems in-
teraction forces from velocities is the necessary condition for existence of irreversibility. This
result allowed to reduced the problem concerning irreversibility of natural systems to the prob-
lem whether generalized forces acting between interacting systems are non-potential when forces
acting between their elements are potential.

For analyzing generalized forces the fact that usually nonequilibrium systems can be repre-
sented in the form of set of equilibrium subsystems which are in motion relative to each other
was used [2, §10]. It gave possibility to reduce problem of irreversible dynamics to the proof of
non-potentiality of generalized forces and that these forces will be decreased. This proof was
carried out in such way. In homogeneous space a closed nonequilibrium system of potentially
interacting elements was prepared. This system was divided into a set of equilibrium subsys-
tems. The energy of subsystem was presented in the form of the sum of internal energy, energy
of relative motion and an interaction energy of the subsystem. After that the equation for en-
ergies’ exchange between subsystems was obtained. In agreement with this equation we found
out that kinetic energy of subsystems will be transformed both to potential and internal energy
of subsystems. Then we showed that reverse transformation of internal energy of subsystems
to energy of their motion is forbidden by the law of conservation of momentum. It provides
relaxation of the system to equilibrium.

The connection of classical mechanics with thermodynamics follows from the fact that the
work of generalized forces will change not only the energy of motion of a subsystem as a whole,
but also its internal energy.

The fact that energy of subsystems’ motion is irreversibly transformed to their internal
energies allowed us to obtain the formula for the entropy deviation of the non-equilibrium
system from equilibrium value.

Here a results of our investigation of the mechanism of irreversibility and interconnection

between classical mechanics and thermodynamics are oﬀered.

2 The generalized Liouville equation and irreversibility of a

hard-disks system

The equation of motion for hard disks is deduced on the basis of collision matrix from a laws
of conservation of energy and a momentum. This equation can be written as [17]:

˙Vk = Φkjδ(ψkj (t))∆kj

(1)

where Vk = Vx + iVy is a complexity form of velocity of k-disk along X and Y arcs consequently;
ψkj = [1 − |lkj|]/|∆kj|; Φkj = i(lkj∆kj)/(|lkj ||∆kj|); δ(ψkj) is a delta function; lkj(t) = z0
kj +

values of disks coordinates; k and j are numbers of colliding disks; i is an imaginary unit; t is a
time; ∆kj = Vk − Vj are relative disks’ velocities; D is disks’ diameter. Collisions are considered
to be central, and friction is neglected. Masses and diameters of disks are accepted to be equal
to 1. The moments of k and j disks collisions are determined by ψkj = 0 equality.

The force of disks’ interaction, which is determined by the right side of eq. (1), depends on
relative velocities of colliding disks and impact parameters. Therefore it is not a gradient of
scalar function. As a force acting between any pair of disks depends on velocity, i.e. it is non-
potential then forces acting between subsystems of disks are non-potential too and depend on
velocities. Therefore for description of there dynamics it is impossible to use canonical equations
of Lagrange, Hamilton and Liouville [12-14]. Hence, it is necessary to replace these equations
by generalized ones which at least are applicable to the open systems with non-potential forces.
The generalized Liouville equation for subsystems was obtained in following way [15, 17].
We took a closed nonequilibrium system which consists of N elements. We divided this system
into R equilibrium subsystems. Then we selected one of subsystems, which was called as m-
subsystem. With the help of D’Alambert equation, the generalized Lagrange and Hamilton
equations were obtained for m-subsystem at the basis of variational method. At obtains of
these equations we considered, that forces between subsystems generally non potential. On the
basis of these equations the generalized Liouville equation was obtained. This equation can be
written as [11,15]:

dfm

Here fm = fm(~rk, ~pk, t) is a normalized distribution function for m-subsystem elements;

~F m is generalized force acting on m-subsystem, ~F m =

ks; k = 1, 2...L are disks of
m-subsystem; s = 1, 2, 3, ..., N − L are external disk acting on k-disk of m-subsystem; m =
1, 2, 3, ...R; ~pk and ~rk are momenta and coordinates of m-subsystem disks consequently.

~F m

Pk=1

Ps=1

The eq.(2) describes change of particles distribution function of the selected equilibrium
subsystem on condition that non-potential forces are acting on it. This equation essentially
diﬀers from canonical Liouville equation. Actually canonical Liouville equation is suitably for
description of potentially interacted systems on conditions for short enough intervals of time
when it is possible to neglect an exchange of energy between systems [2].

The important step during generalization of Liouville equation was to refuse requirement of
potentiality of forces acting between subsystems. It makes this equation applicable for study of
irreversibility [11].

Let us note that the similar form of the generalized Liouville equation can be obtained if
the forces is accepted to be dissipative [16]. But in this case generality of obtained equation

3

would be lost. It is so because postulating of dissipative forces is equivalent to postulating of
irreversibility. Moreover acceptance dissipative forces essentially narrows ﬁeld of applicability
of this equation. Indeed, forces of interaction of disks’ systems are nondissipative though they
are non-potential [17].

A physical essence of the right hand side of the eq. (2) that it is the integral of collisions
which can be obtained with the help of the motion equations of elements. Both under condition
of potentiality of forces, and equilibrium condition when relative motion of subsystems is absent,
the right side of the eq. (2) is equal to zero.

Let us show, how it is possible to obtain possibility of existence of the irreversible dynamics
under condition of non-potentiality forces acting between subsystems using the generalized
Liouville equation [10].

Because the equality

~F m = 0 is correct then the following equation for Lagrangian of en-

will have a place. Here fR is distribution function which corresponds to entire system; ~vk is a ve-

This is in agreement with Liouville theorem about conservation of a systems’ phase space [2].
So, Liouville equation for entire non-equilibrium system is in accordance with the gen-
if the condition that

Thus irreversible dynamics is possible under condition of redistribution of phase-space vol-
ume between subsystems while full volume is an invariant. Reversibility exists if the system is
placed near to equilibrium or it is located in cyclic points of phase-space. In the second case
a periodic change of phase-space volume of subsystems takes place under condition of system
phase-space volume preservation as a whole [9].

Thus generalized Liouville equation allows to describe dynamics of nonequilibrium systems
within the framework of classical mechanics. According to this equation both reversible and
irreversible dynamics take place. Irreversibility is possible only if motions of subsystems are
presented and generalized forces depend on subsystems’ velocities. Presence of such dependence
eliminates an interdiction of irreversibility which is dictated by the Poincare’s theorem about
reversibility. Therefore to prove the existence of irreversibility ﬁrst of all it is necessary to show
presence of the relative motion of subsystems in nonequilibrium systems and non-potentiality
of forces acting between subsystems.

For hard disks the irreversibility is possible because forces acting between subsystems are
non-potential (necessary condition). Therefore if we show that these forces aspire to zero
(suﬃciently condition) then irreversibility for them will be proved.

Let’s take the nonequilibrium system of disks which consists of from two equilibrium subsys-

4

tems: L and K consequently. Let L- subsystem ﬂy at K- subsystem. Let’s designate velocity
of the center of mass L-subsystem as ~VL. Let’s assume that all disks collide simultaneously in
and short enough intervals of time τ . Such assumption does not have inﬂuence on qualitative
characteristics of evolution. Then the equation of motion of disks (4) will be as follows [11]:

Here k = 1, 2, 3, ...L is L-subsystem disks’ numbers. j number corresponds to each k and

point of time t = nτ there corresponds number j; k6= j.

Taking accepted requirements into account it is possible to obtain the expression for the
force acting on a subsystem by summing the equations (3) for all disks of L-subsystem. After
such summation we will obtain:

(4)

Here we have taken into account that collisions of disks L-subsystem with external s - disks
make contribution to the right side of eq. (4). This equation is written down in approach of
pair collisions.

The eq. (4) describes change of a total momentum, eﬀecting onto the L-subsystem as a result
of collisions at the moment nτ . The aspiration of a total momentum to zero is equivalent to
aspiration to zero of the force, acting on the part of external disks. Thus the eq. (4) determines
changes of relative velocities of subsystem .

When L → ∞ due to mixing the uniformity of distribution of impact parameters of disks
takes place. Really,
in accordance with the mixing condition we have the following [13]:
µ(δ)/µ(d) = δ/d (a). Here µ(δ) is a measure which corresponds to the total value of im-
pact parameter ”d”; δ is an arbitrary interval of impact parameters and µ(δ) is corresponding
measure. The fulﬁllment of (a) condition means the proportionality between the number of
collisions of disks which fall at the δ interval, and disk diameter-d.
I.e. the distribution of
impact parameters is homogeneous.

ks >=< Φn

ks >< ∆n−1

If (a) is correct then condition of decay of correlations is right. Therefore in accordance with
eq. (4): < Φn
ks >. As the ﬁrst multiplier depends on impact param-
eters, and the second one depends on relative velocities the condition of decay of correlations
I.e., when
is equivalent to condition of independence of coordinates and momentum [3, 13].

(b).

Thus velocity of a subsystem is decreased. The rate of decreasing is determined by 2/3
factor. The reason of such decreasing is related to chaotization of vectors of disks’ velocities.
Thus, we have obtained that the nonequilibrium disks’ system is equilibrate.

Let us note that mathematical operations used by us are not connected neither with aver-
aging of phase space nor with any other change of real nature of phenomenon which is under
investigation.

Averaging of the phase space is usually used during irreversibility investigation on the basis
of analysis of behaviour of phase trajectory. In the mixing systems phase trajectory eventually
ﬁlls phase space very densely, it is inﬁnitely closed to any accessible point. The irreversibility

5

relates to inﬁnite ﬁne splitting of the phase space by phase trajectory.
It can be performed
by averaging of the phase space i.e. by ”coarse grain”. But as a result of such operation the
motion of phase trajectory becomes probabilistic and therefore irreversible [8]. I.e. operation
of averaging of the phase space introduces irreversibility into a system. As the nature of the
”coarse grain” of phase space is unknown and, most likely, there is no such nature, this approach
does not solve a problem of irreversibility.

We are searching for the mechanism of irreversibility by analyzing of the generalized force.
Though this dynamic parameter is collective and equals sum of exterior forces acting on elements
of subsystem, but it is strictly determined equation of motion also as well as a phase trajectory.
During the analysis of the force we also had used mixing property. It has allowed us to use
integration of forces instead of summation in thermodynamic limit. But in our case integration
was carried out only for estimation of value of change of generalized force due to disks’ collisions.
Thus physical nature of the process was not distorted.

Let us note that according to oﬀered mechanism of irreversibility the equilibrium state is
asymptotically stable. I.e. on deviation of system from an equilibrium point the system returns
back to it [11]. Really, on deviation of system from equilibrium the generalized force ~FL will
appear. As it was shown (see eq. (b) ) this force is a decreasing force. Therefore equilibrium is
asymptotically stable.

|FL| .

It is not diﬃcult to determine characteristic time which is needed for system to return back
to equilibrium on deviation from it. In accordance with expression (b) it can be written down
. I.e., if the system leaves equilibrium due to exterior action then it will return
as tdin ∼
back in characteristic time tdin ∼ 1

d~VL
~FL

R

Important conclusion follows from here. It consists in the fact that stability of equilibrium
point causes restriction of probable ﬂuctuations. Really, let’s suppose that the system has devi-
ated from equilibrium in a probable way. A time of deviation is determined by the probability
laws. According to Smoluchowski formula [8, 22], for ergodic systems average resetting time,
tp, or Poincare’s cycle time is equal to τ = tp(1 − P0)/(P0 − P1), were P1 -is a probability of
return in tp time; P0 is a probability of initial phase region. But on deviation of system from
equilibrium returning force ~FL appears. This force becomes bigger as system becomes farther
from equilibrium. Therefore the amplitudes of possible ﬂuctuations is restricted by this force.
I.e. spontaneous deviation of system from equilibrium state is possible only for such points of
phase space for which characteristic time tdin which is determined by ﬁeld of generalized forces
is more than characteristic time τ which is necessary for spontaneous deviation. This condition
determines the framework of applicability of probabilistic description of dynamics of systems
with the mixing [10, 11].

Thus, in agreement with the generalized Liouville equation the dependence system-system
interaction forces from their relative velocities is a necessary requirement of occurrence of ir-
reversible dynamics. As pair interactions of disks depend on their velocities, the disks system-
system interaction forces also depend on velocities.
It causes an opportunity of existence of
irreversibility. Such opportunity is realized because of decrease of forces of interaction of equi-
librium subsystems of disks into which the nonequilibrium system is divide.
In a result its
system is equilibrates.

The conclusion about irreversibility for a hard-disks system will conﬁrm further at the anal-
ysis of the more general case of dynamics of nonequilibrium systems of potentially interacting
elements. For this purpose, using the procedure of splitting a system into equilibrium subsys-
tems, presentation of their energies as the sum of their energy of motion and internal energy,
the equation of interaction of such subsystems will be obtained. Based on it we will show, that

6

the reason of irreversible dynamics in nonequilibrium system of potentially interacting elements
are a non-potentiality of the generalized forces of interaction of subsystems and decreasing of
them.

3 The relative motion of subsystems

From generalized Liouville equation follows, that irreversibility is possible only when the forces
of interaction of equilibrium subsystems are non-potential. Therefore it is clear, that if nonequi-
librium system represents a set of equilibrium subsystems, which is in relative motion, the proof
of irreversibility is reduced to the proof of decreasing of their relative velocities that is equivalent
to decreasing of system-system interaction forces.

Representation of a nonequilibrium system in the form of set of selected equilibrium subsys-
tems corresponds to local equilibrium approach which is used in statistical physics. Possibility
of such representation is explained by the fact that the time of equilibration for a subsystem is
much less than that for all system [2, 3]. Let’s show that such equilibrium subsystems will be
characterized by relative motion. This fact will allow to reduce the proof of irreversibility for
any systems to the proof of decrease of generalized forces without decrease of generality.

The proof of existence of relative motion of subsystems for nonequilibrium systems follows
from [2, §10]. Let’s take the nonequilibrium system of disks which consists of R equilibrium
subsystems. In accordance with [2] the entropy S for the system can be written down as:

S =

Sm(Em − T tr
m )

R

Xm=1

(5)

Here Sm is entropy for m-subsystem; Em is full energy of m-subsystem; T tr
m/2Mm is a
kinetic energy of motion of m-subsystem; Mm is subsystem’s mass; Pm is momentum. The
argument of Sm is internal energy of m-subsystem.
~Pm = const,

[~rm ~Pm] = const. Here ~rm is a position

As the system is closed we have:

m = P 2

R

R

vector of m-subsystem.

Pm=1

Pm=1

In equilibrium state the entropy as a function of momentum of subsystems is maximum. It
is possible to determine necessary conditions of maximum using method of uncertain Lagrange
multipliers; momentum derivatives from the following expression should be equal to zero:

R

Xm=1

{Sm + aPm + b[rmPm]},

(6)

where a, b are constant multipliers.

∂
∂Pm

Sm(Em − T tr

If we diﬀerentiate Sm with respect to Pm taking deﬁnition of temperature into account we
M ) = −Pm/(MmT ) = −vm/T . Hence, diﬀerentiating eq.(5) with
will obtain:
respect Pm, we shall have: vm = u + [Ωrm] (a), where Ω = bT , u = aT , T is a temperature.
From this fact follows that the entropy is maximum when velocities of all subsystems are
determined by the formula (a). According to this formula all subsystems should move with
identical translational velocities and to rotate with identical angular velocity in equilibrium. It
means, that a closed system in equilibrium state can only move and rotate as the whole; any
relative motions of subsystems are impossible.

As it follows from the formula (5), the rate of system’s deviation from equilibrium is de-
m value. This energy can be selected by dividing the system into equilibrium

termined by T tr

7

subsystems. In accordance with eq. (5) the process of equilibration is caused by transformation
of energy T tr

m to internal energy of systems.

Thus, equilibrium is characterized by condition that T tr

m = 0, which have a place on any
splitting of the equilibrium system into subsystems. Therefore subsystems will have relative
motion in nonequilibrium system. If the system goes to equilibrium then T tr
m energy should
aspire to zero.

4 The subsystems dynamics

The proof of irreversibility for hard disks is based on dependence of velocity on disks’ interac-
tion forces. But all fundamental forces in the nature are potential [20]. And according with
generalized Liouville equation the presence of dependence of the generalized forces on velocities
of motion of subsystems is necessary for existence of irreversibility in systems of potentially
interacting elements. Therefore the problem concerning irreversibility of natural systems is
reduced to the problem whether forces acting between systems are non-potential when forces
acting between their elements are potential. It will be shown below that such dependence have
place for nonequilibrium systems of potentially interacting elements.

We will solve this problem in such way. Let’s take a system of potentially interacting
elements which was prepared as nonequilibrium. We represent it in the form of set of equilibrium
subsystems. After that we obtain the equation for energies’ exchange between subsystems. We
will search for this equation using requirement of existence for subsystems of not one, but two
forms of energies - energies of their motion as a whole and their internal energy. The energy
of interaction of systems will be introduced into the right part of the equation. The energy
of subsystem we present in the form of the sum of its energy of a motion, an internal energy
and an interaction energy.
Internal energy will be represented in the form of the sum of a
kinetic energy of motion of system’s particles concerning its centre of mass and a potential
energy of interaction of particles inside of subsystem. Then time derivation from the energy
presented thus will give the required equation which describes transformation of energy between
subsystems. If we will obtain non-potentiality of the forces acting between subsystems from this
equation then according to generalized Liouville equation the irreversible dynamics is possible.
Thus, as well as in the [18], we use a model of a simple system of particles. The basic
distinction that our approach is non-statistical. It allows to determine the nature of noncon-
servative forces within the framework of classical mechanics and to analyze connection of the
classical mechanics with the ﬁrst and the second laws of thermodynamics.

Let’s take the system which consists of N elements. Masses of elements are accepted to
be equal to 1. We will present energy of the system as the sum of kinetic energy of motion
of the system as a whole-T tr
N and the kinetic energy of the motion of its elements concerning
the center of mass-
N is
It equals the sum of the kinetic energy of relative motion of
internal energy of the system.
N energy is determined by ~VN velocity
elements and the energy of potential interaction. The T tr
of the center of mass. Therefore this energy is characterise the level of regularity of particles’

The equation of motion for elements of system can be obtained by means of diﬀerentiation
~Fij,

of expression of energy of systems with respect to time [12]. We will have: m ˙~vi = −

N

where ~Fij = ∂
∂~rij

U (c). It is a Newton equation .

Owing to splitting of nonequilibrium system into equilibrium subsystems, the problem con-
cerning irreversibility nature is reduced to the problem concerning character of subsystems’
energy exchange. We will call the internal energy of equilibrium subsystem as ”bound energy”
to emphasize the absence of energy of relative motion of microsystems on which this subsystem
can be divided.

To simpliﬁcation let’s take the system which consists of two interacting equilibrium sub-
systems. They are L and K-subsystems. ~VL and ~VK are velocities of the centers of mass of
corresponding subsystems. Number of elements in L-subsystem is equal to L, and number of
elements in K -subsystem is equal to K. Let us suppose that L + K = N and L~VL + K ~VK = 0,
i.e. the center of mass of system is motionless.

Equations for energy exchange between subsystems can be obtained by means of diﬀeren-
tiation of system energy with respect of time along with grouping terms which correspond to
elements of diﬀerent subsystems together.

Using summation of changes of kinetic and potential energies of elements in each subsystem

The eqs. (9, 10) determines the energy exchange between L and K subsystems. We will

call this equation as the Equation of Systems Interaction.

As it follows from the right side of eqs. (9, 10), the change of energy of L-subsystem as a
result of its interaction with K-subsystem is determined by velocities of motion of L-subsystem’s
particles in relation to its center of mass and potential interaction with particles of K-subsystem
and vice versa.

The ﬁrst terms of the left side of eqs. (9, 10) determines the change of the motion energy
one subsystem as a wall in a potential ﬁeld of another subsystem. The second term determines
subsystems’ bound energy change as a result of motion of particles one subsystem in a ﬁeld of
particles of another subsystem.

Non-potentiality of forces of subsystems’ interaction is caused by transformation of kinetic
energy of their motion not only into a potential energy of subsystems as a whole, but also into
bound energy. Increase of a bound energy occurs as a result of decrease of ordered motion of
particles or decrease of velocity of the relative motion of subsystems.

When ~VL = 0, ~VK = 0, energy of relative subsystems’ motion is absent. In this case the full

systems’ energy is equal to the sum of bound energies of subsystems.

Let us explain, why bound energy is increasing only. Firstly we take an equilibrium system.
If we divide this system into two subsystems by any way, they also will be equilibrium. Therefore
generalized forces and relative subsystems velocities are equal to zero. It is clearly that in this
case the spontaneous deviation from equilibrium is possibly only in the case of spontaneous
occurrence of collective motion of particles which will lead to occurrence of relative motion of
subsystems. It is equivalent to occurrence of momentum of a subsystem, which can arise only
due to the internal energy. But the law of conservation of momentum forbids it.

In the second case we consider systems which consists of two subsystems in motion to each
other. Their relative velocity cannot be increased due to their interaction energy as this energy
is determined by velocity relative motion itself. As well as in the previous case the relative
velocity of these subsystems cannot be increased due to their bound energy.

Thus, the decreasing of relative velocities of subsystems is possibly only. This decrease is
caused by the fact that the work of generalized forces increases internal energy of subsystems
due to kinetic energy of relative motion. The increasing of bound energy is non-potential as a
result of decrease of orderliness of motion of particles, i.e. as a result of chaotization of vectors
of particles’ velocities. As the inverse process is impossible, generalized forces can decrease only.
In the case when velocities of particles’ motion inside subsystems can be neglected (hard
body systems approach) the right side term and the second term in the left side of Equation of
Systems Interaction are equal to zero. It is easy to see that Equation of Systems Interaction in
˙~V L = −~Ψ and
this case will be transformed to the Newton’s equations for two hard bodies: m
m

˙~V K = ~Ψ.
It is not so diﬃcult to check, that these equations can be obtained directly by summation
of the Newton equations (c) for particles of each subsystem. As the sum of the forces inside

10

subsystems will be zero, the generalized forces will become the central subsystem-subsystem
interaction forces. These forces will be potential as changes of bound energy of subsystems does
not exist at such summation of the Newton equations (the total work of forces of interaction
of elements in the closed system will be zero). Thus the Newton equations is follows from the
Equation of Systems Interaction when we neglect particles’ motion in relation of the center of
masses of corresponding subsystems.

5 Diﬀerence between particles dynamics and subsystems dy-

namics

The Newton equation (c) can be treated as equation for particles’ interaction forces. The work of
these forces determine transformation of particles’ kinetic energy to their potential energy. This
energy transformation takes place during transition of system from one point of conﬁguration
space into another [12,14]. Forces are determined by gradient of potential energy of particles.
Thus, forces and potential energy of particles are completely determined by coordinates, and
work of potential forces along closed contour is equal to zero.
It corresponds to reversible
dynamics.

And now we will consider Equation of Systems Interaction. From it follows that in nonequi-
librium systems kinetic energy of relative subsystems motion is existed. This energy is connected
with the rate of regularity of particles motion of subsystems. The regularity is determined by
deviation from equilibrium of subsystem velocities’ distribution functions. As against Newton’s
forces, the work of generalized forces will transform kinetic energy of subsystem motion not
only to the subsystem potential energy as a whole, but also to bound energy. Because of such
transformation, the work of the generalized forces along the closed contour in conﬁguration
space is not equal to zero.

The transition of subsystems’ bound energy into kinetic energy of subsystem is impossible.
Really, this transition would be possible only under condition of spontaneous occurrence of
generalized forces inside an equilibrium subsystem. But such occurrence means infringement of
spherical symmetry of distribution function of elements velocities of equilibrium subsystems’ in
relation to the center of mass. And it contradicts to the law of momentum preservation.

Thus, Equation of Systems Interaction as against the Newton equation describes process
of transformation of systems’ energy which is caused not only by transformation of potential
energy into kinetic energy, but also by change of distribution function of velocities of particles
due to increase the rate of chaotic motion of particles.

There is a question why the Newton equation is suitable for description of particles’ dynam-
ics, but nevertheless it does not determine systems’ equilibration? Let us oﬀer the following
answer. Dynamics of selected particles is unequivocally determined by the equation of Newton.
A motion of any particle is reversible. But dynamics of subsystem is described by collective
parameters such as bound energy, generalized forces etc. These parameters ambiguously de-
pend on parameters of particles’ motion. Such ambiguity leads to occurrence of new collective
systems’ laws which do not exist for separate particles. Let’s consider for example, velocity of
motion of systems’ centre of masses, which is constant in the homogeneous space. This velocity
is a collective parameter of system. It is determined by the sum of velocities of all particles of
system. Therefore biunique conformity between velocity of center of mass and particles’ veloci-
ties does not exist. The impossibility of increase of motion energy of an equilibrium subsystem
due to its bound energy is collective law which determines its dynamics. Therefore, inspite
of reversibility of dynamics of separate particle, the subsystems dynamics can be irreversible.

11

Thus, irreversibility is a new property of systems which is absent in dynamics of their particles.
Occurrence of this property within the frame of laws of classical mechanics becomes possible
owing to ambiguous dependence of dynamics’ parameters of subsystems on parameters which
determine dynamics of individual particles.

By exclusion of particles’ potential interaction from Equation of Systems Interaction with
the help of eq. (1), we will obtain the Equation of Systems Interaction for elastic disks systems.
It means that the nature of irreversibility is identical both for systems of elastic disks and for
systems of potentially interacting elements.

6 Classical mechanics and thermodynamics

It is possible to come to thermodynamics with the help of the eqs. (7, 8). Actually, the right
sides of these equations determine an exchange of energy between subsystems due to their
interaction. The ﬁrst term of the left side of each equation determines the change of the motion
energy of subsystem as a whole. In thermodynamics this corresponds to mechanical work which
is carried out by external forces acting on subsystem from inside. The second term of the left
side corresponds to increase of bound energy of a subsystem due to energy of relative motion
of subsystems. In thermodynamics this term corresponds to the change of thermal energy of
system.

It is easy to see the connection between eq. (7) and the basic equation of thermodynamics
[2, 3]: dE = dQ − P dY . Here, E is energy of a subsystem as a whole; Q is thermal energy; P
is pressure; Y is volume according to common terminology,.

Change of energy of selected subsystem is due to the work carried out by external forces.

Therefore, the change of full energy of a subsystem corresponds to dE.

The change of kinetic energy of motion of subsystem as a whole, dT tr, corresponds to the

P dY term. Really, dT tr = ~V d~V = ~V

˙~V dt =

˙~V d~r = P dY [2].

Let’s determine, what term in Equation of Systems Interaction corresponds to the change
of bound energy. According to virial theorem [14, 21], if potential energy is a homogeneous
function of second order of radiuses-vectors then ¯Eins = 2 ¯T ins = 2 ¯U ins. Lines denote averaging
time. We have obtained above that bound energy, Eins, increases due to contribution of T tr
energy. But the opposite process is impossible. Therefore change of Q term corresponds to the
change of Eins, bound energy.

Let’s consider the system to be near to equilibrium. If the subsystem consists of Nm elements

then average energy of each element can be written down as ¯Eins = Eins/Nm = κT ins

.

0

Now let us the bound energy be increased by dQ. According to the virial theorem and
keeping terms of the ﬁrst order, we will have: dQ ≈ T ins
[d~v/~v0], where ~v0 is
the average velocity of an element, and d~v is its change. For subsystems in equilibrium, we will
have d~v/~v0 ∼ dΓm/Γm, where Γm is the phase volume of a subsystem, dΓm will be increased
due to increase of the subsystem energy at dQ value. By keeping terms of the ﬁrst order we will
0 d ln Γm. According deﬁnition d ln Γm = dSins, where Sins is
0 dΓm/Γm = T ins
obtain: dQ ≈ T ins
0 dSins near equilibrium.
subsystem entropy. So dQ ≈ T ins

[dEins/T ins

] = T ins

0

0

0

Let’s consider the connection between generalized forces and entropy. According to eq. (2)
the entropy production in non-equilibrium system is determined by transformation of kinetic
energy of subsystems motion into bound energy. Eventually relative velocities of subsystems
and generalized forces will comes to zero. As a result the energy of relative motion of subsystems
completely transforms into bound energy and the system becomes equilibrate. It means that
energy of motion of subsystem was spent on increase of entropy. Therefore the deviation of

12

entropy from equilibrium is determined by the following formula [19]:

∆S =

{ml

R

Xl=1

ml

Fks

mlvk

dt}

Xk=1

Z Xs

Eml

(11)

Here Eml is a kinetic energy of subsystem; ml is a number elements in ”l” subsystem; R is
a number of subsystems; s is a number of external disks which were collided with internal disk
k; F ml

ks is a force, acting on k-disks; vk is a velocity of k- disk.
The integral in eq. (11) determines the work of F ml
force, during the system’s relaxation
ks
to equilibrium.
In equilibrium the energy of relative motion of subsystems and generalized
forces are equal to zero. I.e. the integral in eq. (11) is determined by the energy of relative
motion of subsystems. It corresponds to phenomenological Clauses formula for entropy [2, 3,
18]. So eq. (11) will be in accordance with the eq. (5). Really if Eins
, than we have:

l ≫ T tr
l

. It corresponds to eq. (11). Both in eq. (5) and eq. (11) entropy increasing

dS =

R

Pl=1

∂Sl
∂T tr
l

dT tr
l

is determined by change of the energy of relative motion of subsystems.

Thus, eq. (11) connects dynamic parameter which is generalized force acting on a subsystem,
with entropy which is a thermodynamic parameter. I.e. eq.(11) establishes connection between
parameters of classical mechanics and thermodynamic parameters. The deviation of system
from equilibrium is characterized by the ratio between energy of relative motion of subsystems
and full energy of system.

7 Conclusion

As a result of investigation of a hard-disks system, the necessity of expansion of the canonical
formalism of Hamilton for description of irreversible dynamics has been found out. This expan-
sion consists in adaptation of the canonical formalism of Hamilton to non-potentially interacting
systems. As a result of it expansion the generalized Liouville equation was obtained. Based
on the this equation it was obtained that non-potentiality of generalized forces is the necessary
condition for irreversible dynamics.

Using a method of splitting of nonequilibrium systems into the equilibrium subsystems and
basing on generalized Liouville equation, the problem of irreversibility was transformed to the
problem concerning character of behavior of generalized forces. In order to solve this problem
the equation of subsystems interaction was obtained. The non-potentiality of the forces acting
between subsystems and their tendency to zero has been found from this equation.

Following explanation of irreversibility can be oﬀered. In spite of potentiality of fundamental
forces, generalized forces are non-potential. The work of these forces irreversibly transforms
energy of relative motion of subsystems to their bound energy. It is so because in accordance
with the law of conservation of momentum, velocity of relative motion of a subsystem cannot be
increased due to bound energy. Therefore these forces and relative velocities of subsystems are
being decreased. The process of decreasing of the relative velocities of subsystems and increasing
of bound energy is performed due to increase of chaotization of vectors of particles’ velocities.
Thus irreversible decrease of energy of relative motion of subsystems due to its transformation
to bound energy determines is essence of the irreversibility mechanism and of the equilibration
process.

Since the non-potentiality of generalized forces is the essence of irreversibility, it is not
possible to explain irreversibility within the framework of canonical Hamilton equations because
of their inapplicability for description of dynamics of systems with non-potential forces [12].

13

The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics follows from the subsystems’ interaction equation. This
equation determines the transformation of the work of subsystem-subsystem interaction forces
to the bound energy and the energy of subsystem motion.

The content of the second law of thermodynamics is determined by irreversible transfor-
mation of energy of motion of subsystems to their bound energy since amount of energy of
subsystems’ motion, which is transformed to bound energy corresponds to increase of entropy.
The oﬀered mechanism of irreversibility determines the horizon of probabilistic description
of systems’ dynamics. In accordance with this mechanism it is impossible to use probabilistic
description for nonequilibrium systems if characteristic time of equilibration due to generalized
forces is less than probabilistic time of the occurrence of the system’s nonequilibrium state.

Thus, the results of irreversibility investigation given here conﬁrm an opportunity of a

substantiation of thermodynamics within the frame of classical mechanics.

Abstract

We present an alternative derivation of the Thamos precession angle. Us-
ing Pauli matrices, the ﬁnite precession angle can be computed exactly. We
also discuss a new physical interpretation of the precession angle.

In the theory of relativity, it is well known that the order of successive Lorentz transfor-

mations is crucial in relating two inertial reference frames [1]:

[Ji, Jj] = iǫijkJk,
[Ji, Kj] = iǫijkKk,
[Ki, Kj]= −iǫijkJk,

(1)

where Ji,j,k and Ki,j,k are the inﬁnitesimal generators of rotations and boosts, respectively.
The phenomenon of Thomas precession is known to originate from this non-commutativity,
in which the eﬀect of two successive Lorentz transformation is equivalent to the product
of a single Lorentz transformation and a rotation. The precession formula can be derived
approximately through the inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformation consisting of rotations and
boosts [2–4]. In this note we intend to present an alternative derivation, showing that the
ﬁnite precession angle can be computed exactly through applications of the spinor algebra [5].

In the two-component spinor algebra, the Pauli matrices satisfy the commutator:

[σi, σj] = 2iǫijkσk

(2)

2 ), while a pure boost in an arbitrary direction ˆn becomes B = exp( −ζ~σ·ˆn

It is clear that Ji = σi/2 (rotations) and Ki = iσi/2 (boosts) represent the two-dimensional
Lorentz group. A ﬁnite rotation about an axis ˆn through an angle θ is written as R =
exp( iθ~σ·ˆn
), where
ζ represents the rapidity parameter, ~ζ = ζ ˆn. This simple properties of σi enable one to
manipulate explicitly these ﬁnite rotations. We will exploit this property to calculate the
result of the combination of ﬁnite Lorentz transformations.

2

We start with the combination of two pure boosts by choosing one boost with rapidity
parameter 2η along the direction ˆnα = −(sin 2αˆx + cos 2αˆz), and the other with rapidity
2ξ ˆz:

K = e−~ξ·~σe−~η·~σ = e−ξσ3eη(cos 2ασ3+sin 2ασ1).

(3)

The combination of two pure boosts is equivalent to the combination of a third boost and a
rotation:

K = eΛ(cos 2Θσ3+sin 2Θσ1)eiΨσ2

= e−iΘσ2eΛσ3ei(Θ+Ψ)σ2.

(4)

Here 2Λ is the third rapidity in the direction ˆnΘ = −(sin 2Θˆx + cos 2Θˆz), while 2Ψ is the
Thomas precession angle rotated about ˆy. Given ξ, η, and α, we are interested in how Λ,
Θ, and the angle Ψ in particular, can be derived exactly. It turns out that KK T and K T K
provide a simple approach to this problem.

We may write KK T from eq.(3):

KK T = e−ξσ3e2η(cos 2ασ3+sin 2ασ1)e−ξσ3.

But from eq.(4),

KK T = e2Λ(cos 2Θσ3+sin Θσ1) = e−iΘσ2e2Λσ3eiΘσ2

= cosh 2Λ + (cos 2Θσ3 + sin Θσ1) sinh 2Λ.

2

(5)

(6)

We may then cast the above two equations into [6]:

KK T = e−iΘσ2e2Λσ3eiΘσ2

= e−ξσ3e2η(cos 2ασ3+sin 2ασ1)e−ξσ3
= cosh 2ξ cosh 2η − cos 2α sinh 2ξ sinh 2η +

[− sinh 2ξ cosh 2η + cos 2α cosh 2ξ sinh 2η]σ3
+[sin 2α sinh 2η]σ1.

Comparing eq.(7) and the second line of eq.(6), it follows that

tan 2Θ =

sin 2α sinh 2η

− cosh 2η sinh 2ξ + cos 2α sinh 2η cosh 2ξ

,

cosh 2Λ = cosh 2ξ cosh 2η − cos 2α sinh 2ξ sinh 2η.

(7)

(8)

(9)

Note that Ψ is canceled out in KK T . Eqs.(8) and (9) are equivalent to eq.(11.32) in Ref.2.

To compute Ψ, we now turn to K T K. From eq.(3), we ﬁnd

K T K = eη(cos 2ασ3+sin 2ασ1)e−2ξσ3eη(cos 2ασ3+sin 2ασ1),

while eq.(4) gives

K T K = e−i(Θ+Ψ)σ2e2Λσ3ei(Θ+Ψ)σ2.

We may further simplify eq.(10) by noting that

e−iασ2eησ3eiασ2 = eη(cos 2ασ3+sin 2ασ1).

This leads us to

K T K = e−iασ2(eησ3e−2ξσ(−α)eησ3)eiασ2,

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

where σ(−α) ≡ cos(−2α)σ3 + sin(−2α)σ1. We therefore arrive at a simple relation from
eq.(11) and eq.(13):

e−i(Θ+Ψ−α)σ2e2Λσ3ei(Θ+Ψ−α)σ2 = eησ3e−2ξσ(−α)eησ3.

(14)

It is interesting to observe that, with the substitutions η → −ξ, ξ → −η, and α → −α,
the right-hand side of eq.(14) is nothing but KK T in eq.(5). For this reason, we can readily
write down tan 2(Θ + Ψ − α) directly from eq.(8):

tan 2(Θ + Ψ − α) ≡ tan 2Φ =

sin 2α sinh 2ξ

cosh 2ξ sinh 2η − cos 2α sinh 2ξ cosh 2η

.

(15)

The ﬁnite Thomas precession angle 2Ψ can therefore be expressed in terms of ξ, η, and α:

tan 2Ψ =

tan 2Φ − tan 2Θ + (1 + tan 2Φ tan 2Θ) tan 2α
1 + tan 2Φ tan 2Θ − (tan 2Φ − tan 2Θ) tan 2α

,

(16)

3

where tan 2Θ and tan 2Φ are given in eq.(8) and eq.(15), respectively.

We next check our result under inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformations. Let −2~η = 2~ξ + δ~ξ
and α ≪ 1 for simplicity, where |δ~ξ| ≃ |2~ξ||2α| ≪ |2~ξ|. Note that Θ, Φ, and Ψ, become
inﬁnitesimal as well. To ﬁrst order in δξ, sinh 2η ≃ sinh 2ξ + δξ cosh 2ξ and cosh 2η ≃
cosh 2ξ + δξ sinh 2ξ. Eq.(8) then becomes

(sinh 2ξ + δξ cosh 2ξ),

(17)

tan 2Θ ≃ 2Θ ≃

while eq.(15) yields

tan 2Φ ≃ 2Φ ≃

sinh 2ξ.

(18)

(19)

The inﬁnitesimal Thomas precession angle about ˆy follows immediately:

2Ψ ≃ 2(α − Θ + Φ) ≃ 2α(1 − cosh 2ξ).

To compare eq.(19) with the result in Ref.2, we note that ~β and δ~β in Ref.2 are simply

2~ξ and δ~ξ, respectively. We then write cosh 2ξ ≡ γ and sinh 2ξ ≡ γ(2ξ). From Ref.2,

∆~Ω =

−γ2
γ + 1

(~β × δ~β) ≃

−γ2
γ + 1

|2~ξ||δ~ξ|ˆy

= (−2α)

γ2(2ξ)2
1 + γ

ˆy = 2α(cosh 2ξ − 1)ˆy

Therefore, to the ﬁrst order in δξ, eq.(16) reduces to

2Ψ ≃ −∆Ω.

(20)

(21)

where ∆Ω is the rotated angle in Ref.2. The minus sign in the above equation arises from
the fact that 2Ψ in our formulation is the rotated angle associated with the third boost,
while the angle ∆Ω in Ref.2 associates with the combined boosts.

It is also worthwhile to examine the role played by Thomas precession angle as two boosts

are combined in reverse order. One notes from eq.(3) and eq.(4),

e−ξσ3eησα = eΛσΘeiΨσ2,

where σα ≡ cos 2ασ3 + sin 2ασ1, and σΘ ≡ cos 2Θσ3 + sin 2Θσ1. It follows that

e−ξσ3eησαe−iΨσ2 = eΛσΘ.

Note that σ1 and σ3 are symmetric while σ2 is antisymmetric:

(eΛσΘ)T = eΛσΘ = e−ξσ3eησαe−iΨσ2.

After taking the transpose, the left-hand side of eq.(23) becomes

(22)

(23)

(24)

4

We thus reach the relation:

eiΨσ2eησαe−ξσ3.

eiΨσ2eησαe−ξσ3eiΨσ2 = e−ξσ3eησα.

(25)

The combination of two boosts,

is related to its reverse,
exp(ησα) exp(−ξσ3), by two identical rotations, eiΨσ2. In other words, operating the same
rotations on a reference frame before and after two boosts can bring this frame to another ref-
erence frame which is reached by the same two boosts in reverse order. The angle associates
with this particular rotation is the Thomas precession angle.

exp(−ξσ3) exp(ησα),

In this note, we showed how the use of Pauli matrices can provide a general and eﬀective
way of solving the problem of combining ﬁnite Lorentz transformations. This advantage is
illustrated through the derivation and a physical interpreting of the ﬁnite Thomas precession
angle.

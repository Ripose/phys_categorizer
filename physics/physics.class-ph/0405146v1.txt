Induction and Mutually Obstructing Equilibria

Dorothea Hahn and Mario Liu∗
Theoretische Physik, Universit¨at T¨ubingen, 72076 T¨ubingen, Germany
(Dated: November 19, 2013)

A uniﬁed, consistent and simple view of the Faraday law of induction is presented, which consists
of two points: discriminating the lab- from the rest-frame electric ﬁeld and understanding it is the
impossibility for both ﬁelds to vanish simultaneously, which generates and maintains the circular
current. A number of illustrative examples are considered, including a mechano-electric pendulum
to exhibit periodic and reversible conversion between electrical and mechanical energy.

INTRODUCTION

II. OBJECTIONS

The Faraday law of induction equates the change of the
magnetic ﬂux φ to the sum of potential drops along a
wire loop,

d

dt φ ≡ d

dt

~B · d ~A = −

~E · d~ℓ = −

Ui.

It contains two eﬀects: The ﬁrst concerns a changing ﬁeld
( ∂
at constant area, d
~B) · d ~A, and is obtained by
∂t
integrating the Maxwell equation, ∂
~B = −~∇ × ~E.
∂t

dt φ =

R

~B · (~v × d~ℓ) = ~B · d
dt

The second eﬀect is given by changing the area of a
conducting loop at a static (and frequently uniform) ﬁeld,
d
~A. This is a little harder to
dt φ =
grasp: Since ∂
~B = 0, an integration of the electric ﬁeld
H
∂t
~E · d~ℓ = 0,
~∇ × ~E · d ~A =
around the loop is zero,
and it appears surprising at ﬁrst that a current should
nevertheless ﬂow. The prevalent explanation is1: The
electrons in the moving section of the loop are subject to
the Lorentz force, ﬁnite even if the electric ﬁeld vanishes,
~F = e( ~E + ~v × ~B) = e~v × ~B.
It is their response to,
and the resultant motion along, ~F that gives rise to the
current I, see Fig 1. More quantitatively, observing that

~v × ~B is the force per unit charge, same as the electric
ﬁeld ~E, one concludes that both should also otherwise
be similar. So integrating ~v × ~B along the loop yields an
“induced” electric potential U ind =
~v × ~B · d~ℓ. And it
is only natural to employ U ind in the Ohm law,

H

RI = U ind =

~v × ~B · d~ℓ,

with R the total electric resistance of the loop, and I the
current. Because this is reminiscent of batteries, U ind is
also referred to as an electromotive force.

When ﬁrst encountering the Faraday’s law, students
are frequently sensitized by their teachers to the dis-
concerting fact that this beautifully simple law lacks a
uniﬁed understanding, as one needs both the Lorentz
force and one of the Maxwell equations to derive it. In
his famous lectures2, Feynman succinctly described, and
lamented, a general sense of resignation:

We know of no other place in physics where
such a simple and accurate general principle
requires for its real understanding an analysis
in terms of two diﬀerent phenomena. Usu-
ally such a beautiful generalization is found
to stem from a single deep underlining prin-
ciple. Nevertheless, in this case there does not
appear to be any such profound implication.
We have to understand the “rule” as the com-
bined eﬀect of two quite separate phenomena.

Two objections to the above view of induction are also
worthy of some attention. First, there are two diﬀerent
Lorentz forces: The macroscopic one, ~j × h ~Bi, given in
terms of the averaged ﬁeld, expresses the directly veri-
ﬁable force on a current carrying wire. The force on an
electron, e( ~E+~ve× ~B), on the other hand, is a microscopic
formula, given in terms of the electron velocity ve and the
microscopic ﬁeld ~B. (Only in this paragraph does ~B de-
note the microscopic ﬁeld. It is always the macroscopic,
coarse-grained ﬁeld otherwise.) Electrons in conductors
have a broad velocity distribution, and they are exposed
to strongly varying ﬁelds. Therefore, it appears strik-
ingly bold to assert that the average magnetic force per
unit charge, h~ve × ~Bi, is simply ~v × h ~Bi, the velocity of
the wire times the average B-ﬁeld, as we did above.

It is instructive to reﬂect upon the Hall Eﬀect in this
context. If evaluated in the same naive fashion, employ-
ing the Lorentz force in a classical free electron model,
the result is notoriously unreliable and rarely agrees well
with experiments. In fact, even the sign may be wrong
— then it is referred to as the anomalous Hall eﬀect. So
why is the Faraday law universally accurate?

Second, even disregarding these doubts, the above
Its two

derivation appears to contain a logical error.

on the right, as one usually does. But we must not forget
that each formula remains valid on its own. If the ﬁeld is
static, ∂
~B = 0, the sum of potentials vanishes,
Ui =

0, irrespective whether ~B · d
~A vanishes or not. If there

is only one resistive element in the circuit, reducing
Ui
to a single voltage drop UR, then both this voltage and
the current will always vanish, I = UR/R = 0. In other
words, even if ~B · d
~A = −U ind is ﬁnite, we must not
dt
write RI = U ind, as in Eq (2), to account for Faraday’s
observation, as this clearly violates the Maxwell equation.

III. TWO ELECTRIC EQUILIBRIA

The consideration below avoids all these diﬃculties
and inconsistencies. We start by introducing the elec-
tric ﬁeld ~E0 of the conductor’s local rest-frame.
It is
related to the lab-frame ﬁeld ~E as

~E0 = ~E + ~v × ~B.

(Only terms to ﬁrst order in v/c are included in this
paper.) Note that ~v is the macroscopic velocity of the
medium – an unambiguous, directly observable quan-
tity. Rest-frame ﬁelds are important, because conductors
strive to reduce them. As long as ~E0 is ﬁnite, there is a
current ~j = σ ~E0, which redistributes the charge to relax
~E0 to zero. Only then is the conductor in equilibrium.
One could not possibly substitute ~E for ~E0 in these state-
ments, because ~E depends on the observer’s frame that
can be changed at will, while the conductor’s equilibrium
is an unambiguous fact, independent of observers.

A metallic object at rest is in equilibrium if ~E = 0; if
it moves with the velocity ~v, we have ~E0 = 0 instead, so
the lab-frame ﬁeld is ﬁnite, ~E = −~v × ~B. In any con-
ﬁguration such as in Fig. (1) that oﬀers two inequivalent
paths, “frustration” sets in, as the moving section strives
~v × ~B · d~ℓ,
to establish a ﬁnite potential diﬀerence, −
by charge separation, while the stationary part attempts
to eliminate it: The incompatibility of both equilibria,
working hard to obstruct each other, is what gives rise
to a current that ﬂows as long as ~v is ﬁnite.

R

A limiting case is easy to see: If the resistance of the
sliding bar is much larger than that of the stationary arc,
see Fig. 1, the latter is much better able to maintain equi-
librium, ~E ≈ 0, so the current ~j = σ ~E0 is approximately
σ~v × ~B – same as obtained above using the Lorentz force.
For a general quantitative account, we follow Landau and
Lifshitz3 to integrate the Maxwell equation in the form
∂
∂t

~B = −~∇ × ( ~E0 − ~v × ~B), arriving at

FIG. 2: Equilibrium requires the rest-frame electric ﬁeld of
both the stationary and moving section of the wire to vanish.
As this cannot happen simultaneously, a current is generated
“out of frustration.”

Identifying the conductor’s velocity ~v with that the area
~A changes, the two terms on the left may be combined as

as the result of the general case. Note that the potential
remains constant, ~E0 ≡ 0, between the resistors, and
there is no need for an electromotive force.

IV. A MECHANO-ELECTRIC PENDULUM

A worthwhile variation contains all three elements: re-
sistor, coil and capacitance. With L denoting the induc-
tivity, C the capacitance, and ω the frequency, they are

U 0

L = −iωL I, U 0

C = I/(−iωC).

(8)

Inserting them in Eq (6), assuming a uniform and con-
stant ~B, denoting the relevant length of the moving wire
as ~ℓ, see Fig. 3, we ﬁnd

[iωL − R + (iωC)−1]I = ~B · (~v × ~ℓ).

(9)

The motion of the wire (of mass M ) is subject to the
Lorentz force. For uniform ~v, it is given as
~j × ~B dV = ~ℓ × ~BI.

Since both the capacitance and the moving wire con-
tribute to the restoring force, the wire alone would suf-
ﬁce to form a pendulum with the inductance. Clearly,
the numbers are such that a conveniently observable res-
onance of around 1 Hz seems possible – if the sliding
resistance can be suﬃciently reduced4.

M , length ℓ), a resistor, a coil and a capacitor. Wire and coil
alone suﬃce for the function of a mechano-electric pendulum
– each standing for one of the two aspects of the Faraday law.
The oscillation of the wire graphically displays the periodic
conversion of electric and mechanical energy.

V. BULK CONDUCTORS

The validity of the Faraday law, Eq (6), is conﬁned to
wire loops, because the conductor’s velocity ~v was identi-
ﬁed with the rate the area ~A changes, or ˙A = vℓ. Yet the
circumstance of mutually obstructing electric equilibria,
giving rise to currents, occurs under rather more general
conditions – including especially bulk metal. Consider
ﬁrst the wire grid of Fig. 4, moving with the velocity ~v
from a region without ﬁeld into one with a ﬁnite mag-
netic ﬁeld. One may of course apply Eq (6) for all possible
loops of this grid, though it is much simpler to map it
onto Fig. (2), considering two inequivalent paths, the two
ﬁeld-exposed bars striving to establish a potential diﬀer-
ence, and the four ﬁeld-free ones working to eliminate it.
Each is respectively characterized by the eﬀective resis-
tance, R2 = R/2 and R1 = R/4, if we take all vertical
bars to be identical, with resistance R, and neglect the
contribution from the horizontal wire. The result is again
Eq (7), or

−(R/2 + R/4)I = ~B · (~v × ~ℓ).

To obtain the breaking force, we insert this expression
for the current I in Eq (10),

M ∂

∂t~v = −(4ℓ2B2/3R)~v,

(13)

with 3RM/(4ℓ2B2) being the relaxation time – which of
course will change after another vertical wire moves into
the ﬁeld. If one of the two horizontal wires is lacking, no
current at all will ﬂow, and no breaking takes place – be-
cause there is no inequivalent paths. Each portion of the
wire net is happily in equilibrium by itself, without the
need or possibility to obstruct that of the other portion.
Similar circumstances reign when a solid metal plate
enters a magnetic ﬁeld, because the value of the eﬀective
R2 and R1 decreases with the width of its region. At the
beginning, the ﬁeld-exposed region is narrow, and R2 is
the dominating one. Toward the end, when the ﬁeld-free
region is narrow, R1 becomes large and is the one limit-
ing the current. The largest current ﬂows, and maximal
breaking by the Lorentz force occurs, when the plate is
half in. No current at all ﬂows when one of the two re-
gions ceases to exist. If a metal comb enters the ﬁeld,
each tooth is in eﬀect an electrically independent entity.
Due to their narrow width, the resistance is always large
in comparison, so the current, the Lorentz force and the
breaking are always much smaller.

The next example is the eddy-current break, a piece of
metal moving with ~v, with only part of the metal exposed
to a magnetic ﬁeld. Equilibrium is given by ~E = 0 outside
the ﬁeld-exposed region, and by ~E = −~v × ~B inside it.
Any deviation from these values churns up a current ~j to
re-establish them – obviously quite the same dilemma as
before. The result is again a frustration-induced current,
which dissipates the kinetic energy of the moving plate
eﬀectively. Constant magnetic ﬁeld and charge density
imply the ﬁeld equations:

~∇ × ~E = 0,

~∇ · ~j = σ ~∇ · ( ~E + ~v × ~B) = 0,

(14)

and the boundary conditions: △Et = 0, △En = −~v × ~B.
These have been solved5 assuming constant ~B, ~v, and
a circular ﬁeld-exposed region. The result is a dipolar
current ﬁeld, with equal eﬀective resistance, R2 = R1.

VI. FEYNMAN’S ROCKING CONTACT

Finally, we discuss Feynman’s rocking contact6, which
consists of two metal plates with slightly curved edges,
such that their contact is only in one point, see the dotted
lines of Fig. 5.
It was presented in his lectures as an
example for circumstances in which the Faraday’s law
does not hold, with a hint that it could be analyzed with
the Lorentz force. However, in any bulk geometry such
as the one here, there is little reason why the electron
velocity ~ve should in any way resemble ~v of the metal.
So the Lorentz force cannot be too useful. And it is the
rest-frame electric ﬁeld that will again do the trick.

the two spherical plates should be rather similar.

FIG. 6: Two metal wheels oscillating in the presence of a
B-ﬁeld generates an alternating current.

To understand the rocking contact, ﬁrst consider a
metal wheel rotating with the angular velocity ω, in the
presence of a ﬁeld ~B k ~ω. Being in equilibrium, ~E0 = 0,
implies ~E = −~v × ~B with ~v = ~ω × ~r⊥, or ~E = −~r⊥(~ω · ~B),

4

with the constant electric density, ρ = ~∇ · ~E = −2~ω · ~B.
Assuming the wheel is neutral, there is a total surface
charge of 2V ~ω · ~B at the rim (V denotes the volume of the
wheel). Reversing the rotation also reverses the charges.
Next consider Fig. 6, depicting two metal wheels rotat-
ing in place, so the runner in between moves. The runner
has two conducting surfaces separated by an insulating
sheet. Connecting the two surfaces will give rise to a
one-shot current, which neutralizes the opposite surface
charges of the wheels – no frustration here. Oscillating
the runner generates an alternating current.

Now reconsider Fig 5, depicting either two wheels rock-
ing against each other, or if we take away the metal be-
hind the dotted lines, the rocking contact of6. The ge-
ometry is slightly more complex, because there is also a
contribution from the translational velocity. But the ba-
sic analysis of the last example remains valid. Since the
rotating parts are already in contact to each other, little
if any current will travel via the wires.

VII. SUMMARY

We summarize. Starting from the fact that an elec-
tric equilibrium is given only if the electric ﬁeld of the
local rest frame vanishes, or ~E = −~v × ~B, many phe-
nomena concerning metal parts moving in the presence
of a magnetic ﬁeld are shown to become easily under-
standable, and accessible for fully or semi-quantitative
analysis. The Faraday Law is seen as a special case of
two mutually obstructing electric equilibria, as a result
of which a circular electric current is maintained.

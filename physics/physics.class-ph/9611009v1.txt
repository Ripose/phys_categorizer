Recently a new version of non-Maxwellian theories of electromagnetism has been pro-
posed [1,2]. As a matter of fact, the Evans-Vigier B(3) theory includes a spin variable in the
classical theory and presents itself a straightforward development of the Belinfante, Ohanian
and Kim ideas [3–5]. In the presented note I restrict myself only one particular question
I would not like to speak about a numerous
of the relativistic invariance of this theory.
variety of other generalizations of the Maxwell’s theory referring a reader to the recent re-
view [6]. All those theories are earlier given either strong critics (while not always perfectly
reasonable) or ignorance and only in the nineties several new versions appeared at once,
what ensures that the question would obtain serious, careful and justiﬁed consideration.
The B(3) model is not an exception. A list of works criticizing this theory was presented in
ref. [8] and that author wrote several critical comments too [7,8]. A serious objection to the
Evans-Vigier theory which was presented by Comay is that he believes that the modiﬁed
electrodynamics is not a relativistic covariant theory. I don’t not know if his papers would
be published but I think that the questions of Dr. Comay may arise in future analyses of
the B(3) theory and, therefore, are required detailed answers.

According to [9, Eq.(11.149)] the Lorentz transformation rules for electric and magnetic

ﬁelds are the following:

First of all, one should mention that these equations are valid for electromagnetic ﬁelds of
various polarization conﬁgurations. Next, Eqs. (2a,2b) preserve properties of the vectors
B (axial) and E (polar) with respect to the space inversion operation. Furthermore, if we
consider other ﬁeld conﬁgurations like φL,R = E

i.e, it becomes obviously that they transform as the right- and the left- parts of the Wein-
berg’s 2(2S + 1)

component ﬁeld function [10].

Now, we can consider the question of the Lorentz transformations for transversal modes
B(1), B(2), E(1) and E(2) and, hence, to make a correct conclusion about the transformation
of B(1)
In the ﬁrst frame transversal modes of the

We have implied that in a free-space circularly-polarized radiation B(0) = E(0). The pure
Lorentz transformations (without inversions) do not change the sign of the phase of the
ﬁeld functions, so we should consider separately properties of the set of B(1) and E(1), the
negative-energy solutions in QFT, and another set of B(2) and E(2), the positive-energy
solutions. Thus, one can deduce from Eqs. (2a,2b)

1One would wish to study properties of this physical system with respect to the space inversion
operation. Since, explicit forms of transversal modes of electric ﬁeld in the ﬁrst frame are propor-
tional (with imaginary coeﬃcients) to the transversal modes of the magnetic ﬁeld some fraction of
E(k) or B(k) can be combined with the vector of other parity (like we are doing in the process of
calculations). Furthermore, one can take any combinations of Eq. (5a) and Eq. (5c) multiplied
by an arbitrary phase factor, or that of Eq. (5b) and Eq. (5d) multiplied by a phase factor. The
parity properties of the ﬁeld functions in the general case would be diﬀerent in the left-hand side
and the right-hand side of resulting equations. Generally speaking, this notation is used only for
simpliﬁcation of calculations. In fact, one can also proceed further with the forms (5a-5d).

In the notation of the equations (6a-6d) vectors B(k) and E(k) of the ﬁrst frame already do
not have deﬁnite parity properties, but B(k) ′ and E(k) ′ still have. Then, we observed that
a) the properties E(k) to be proportional to B(k) with imaginary coeﬃcients are preserved
and b) B(1) and E(1) in Eqs. (6a-6d) transform like B + iE of the Cartesian basis, i.e like
the right part of the Weinberg ﬁeld function and B(2) and E(2), like B
iE, i.e. like the left
part of the Weinberg ﬁeld function.

Using the above rules to ﬁnd the transformed 3-vector B(3) ′ is just an algebraic exercise.

where ˆk is the orth vector of the axis OZ. We know that the longitudinal mode in the Evans-
Vigier theory is deﬁned as B(3) = B(3) ∗ = B(0)k. Thus, considering that B(0) transforms
as zero-component of the four-vector and B(3) as space components of the four-vector: [9,

A reader interested in these matters can exercise to prove covariance of other cyclic rela-

One can see that the transformations (8a,8b) are the ones for a light-like 4-vector of the
Minkowski space, formed by (B(0), B(3)). They are similar (while not identical) to the trans-
formation rules for the spin vector [9, Eq.(11.159)]. The diﬀerence with that consideration
of a massive particle is caused by the impossibility to ﬁnd a rest system for the photon
which is believed to move with the invariant velocity c. Nevertheless, some relations be-
tween the concept of the Pauli-Lyuban’sky vector of the antisymmetric tensor ﬁelds and the
B(3) concept have been found elsewhere [11,6,12].

I would like to indicate origins of why Dr. Comay achieved the opposite incorrect result:
1) Obviously, one is not allowed to identify Bz and B(3), the ﬁrst one is an entry of the
antisymmetric tensor and the second one is a 3-vector quantity, the entry of the 4-vector.
They are diﬀerent geometric objects. Of course, the Poynting vector must be perpendicular
to the E and B, the Cartesian 3-vectors , whose components are entries of the antisymmetric
tensor ﬁeld. The B(3) vector is a vector of diﬀerent nature, while, in its turn, it forms an
“isotopic” vector with B(1) and B(2) in a circular complex basis2 and while its physical eﬀect
is similar to that of the Cartesian B, namely, magnetization. 2) One is not allowed to forget
about the fact that B(0) is not a scalar quantity, it is a “scalar” component of the 4-vector;
so Comay’s “appropriate units” would be diﬀerent in the second frame. 3) As we have found
the axial 3-vector B(3) is always aligned with the OZ axis in all frames like the Poynting
vector (polar) is, provided that the ordinary electric and magnetic ﬁelds lie in the XY
plane in these frames. If this is not the case one can do that by rotation, using the unitary
matrix. So, unfortunately, the paper by Comay [7] ensures that the author has superﬁcial
understanding both the Evans-Vigier B(3) Theory and the Relativity Theory. I believe, the
true title of the Comay’s paper could be: “Relativity and Longitudinal Magnetic Field of
the Photon Versus Dr. Comay”. Brieﬂy referring to the paper [8] one can apparently note
that, in my opinion, the B(3) ﬁeld is a property of one photon and when considering the
many-photon problem with various types of polarizations in a superposition the question
whether the circulation of this vector would be diﬀerent from zero (?) must be regarded
more carefully; furthermore, the applicability of the dynamical equations to this vector,
which Comay refers to, is not obvious for me.

The conclusion is obvious: the B(3) Evans-Vigier modiﬁed electrodynamics is a relativis-
tic covariant theory if one regards it mathematically correctly. This construct is the simplest
and most natural representation of a particle spin. The B
cyclic relations manifest rela-
tions between Lorentz group generators answering for the angular momentum [1,2,11,13].
Therefore, the attacks of Profs. L. D. Barron, A. D. Buckingham, E. Comay, D. Grimes, A.
Lakhtakia at the Evans-Vigier B(3) theory signify that, in fact, they doubt existence of the
spin variable (additional discrete phase-free variable according to Wigner) and, hence, all
development of physics since its (spin) discovery.3 Undoubtedly, such a viewpoint could lead

2Let me remind that the Cartesian basis is a pure real basis. Introducing complex vectors we,
in fact, enlarge the space; a number of independent components may increase and, the bases, in
general, are not equivalent mathematically.

3Surprisingly, the opposite claims (of the pure “longitudinal nature” of the massless antisymmetric
tensor ﬁelds) by several authors are yet another unexplained statements. That was point out yet
by F. Belinfante (1939) in the comment to the paper by Durandin and Erschow [Phys. Z. Sowjet.
12 (1937) 466]: “Three directions of polarization are possible for a Proca quantum with given
momentum and charge”. While the question for neutral particles (self/anti-self charge conjugate
states) should be regarded properly in both the Majorana and the Dirac constructs, even in this
case one can see from the ﬁrst sight that those claims of the pure “longitudinal nature” contradict
with a classical limit and with the Weinberg theorem B
A = λ, ref. [10b]. By the way, I
don’t understand reasons to call this ﬁeld after the paper of M. Kalb and P. Ramond (1974).

to deep contradictions with experimental results (the spin-spin interaction, the inverse Fara-
day eﬀect, the optical Cotton-Mouton eﬀect, the Tam and Happer experment (1977), etc,
etc). It is praised courage, but whether it has suﬃcient reasons? On an equal footing claims
of “it is unknowable” and/or “is not fundamental ” are based on the same unknowable logic.
As opposed to them with introduction of this variable in a classical manner [3,4,1,2,11,13]
nobody wants to doubt all theoretical results of QED and other gauge models. As a matter
of fact, existence of the spin variable and of diﬀerent polarization states are accounted in
calculations of QED matrix elements. The proposed development of the Maxwell’s theory
does not signify the necessity of rejecting the results which have been obtained in regions
where the old models do work. What we want is: to unify interactions, to systemize results
on the basis of the Poincar`e group symmetries, to simplify the theory and, perhaps, to pre-
dict yet unobserved phenomena. As a matter of fact, we follow advice of A. Einstein and
W. Pauli to build a reliable theory on the basis of the ﬁrst principles, namely, of irreducible
representations of the Poincar`e group (private communication from M. Sachs to M. Evans).
Some progress in this direction has already been achieved [6,14,15].

I understand that further discussions of the Evans-Vigier model would be desirable. First
of all, the questions arise, whether this theory implies a photon mass? namely, how does
this theory account these eﬀects (mass appears to manifest itself here in somewhat diﬀerent
form)? if so what is the massless limit of this theory? what are relations between the E(2),
O(3) groups and gauge transformations of the 4-potential electrodynamics [5] and of other
gauge models? can a massless ﬁeld be particulate? and, ﬁnally, what is the mass itself?
It is also necessary to give relations of this construct with those presented by L. Horwitz,
M. Sachs, A. Staruszkiewicz, D. Ahluwalia and myself. This is the aim of the forthcoming
papers.

I am grateful to Prof. M. Evans for many internet communications on the concept of
the B(3) ﬁeld and estimate his eﬀorts as signiﬁcant (while not always agree with him). I
acknowledge the help of Prof. A. F. Pashkov, who informed me about the papers [3,4], and
Prof. D. V. Ahluwalia for his kind comments.

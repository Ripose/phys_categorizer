A slightly tilted vertical cylinder on a table-top rights itself, coming to a halt after “rocking” for
a while. These rocking motions may involve collisions of the cylinder’s circular bottom surface with
the table-top. Here we study the more likely motions that almost but do not quite involve a face-
down collision of the cylinder’s bottom with the table-top. For ideal cylinders that can roll without
slip or slide without friction on their circular bottoms, the typical rocking motions do not involve
collisions. Instead, they involve slow inverted pendulum-like motions interrupted by inﬁnitely fast
rolling or sliding motions during which the contact point with the table shifts by a ﬁnite angle in
inﬁnitesimal time. We derive simple asymptotic formulas for this “angle of turn” of the contact
point for two simple cases: sliding without friction and rolling without slip. These formulas for the
angle of turn depend only on the properties of the cylinder and the assumed friction law. These
results explain why not-too-tall cylinders or disks never seem to rock symmetrically on diametrically
opposite ends. Also, on the other hand, very tall cylinders that appear to rock back and forth on
diametrically opposite points on the bottom rim are really (often) rolling and/or sliding very quickly
on the rim by a little over 180 degrees.

INTRODUCTION

Consider a cylinder, a body of revolution, with a planar
circular bottom, standing vertically on a horizontal table-
top so that the planar circular bottom of the cylinder is
in contact with the table. Now tilt the cylinder by a
small angle and gently let go, with exactly zero initial
angular velocity. The cylinder will right itself, but in
the process fall ﬂat on its bottom. What happens next?
Generally, the cylinder comes to a quick halt after a little
bit of “rocking” on its circular bottom rim. During this
rocking motion, too much energy is lost too quickly for
anything interesting to be noticed by the naked eye.

To aid the eye, we perform a slightly diﬀerent exper-
iment (see video [9]), whose typical result is shown in
Fig. 1. Instead of gently letting go of the slightly tilted
cylinder, we ﬂick the cylinder’s top forward with our ﬁn-
gers so as to provide a righting angular velocity – that is,
an angular velocity exactly along the axis about which
the cylinder is tilted, making sure that the angular ve-
locity is not so high that the cylinder leaves the table
as it pivots over. The cylinder, as before, ﬁrst becomes
(almost) vertical as it rotates like an inverted pendulum
about the initial contact point A (assuming no slip), its
bottom face apparently colliding with the table. After
a brief interaction with the table, the cylinder falls over
onto the other side, rotating like an inverted pendulum

in a vertical plane about a new contact point B. When
this experiment is performed with a cylinder that is not
too tall and too thin, we ﬁnd that the cylinder never falls
over onto the diametrically opposite side, as may perhaps
be expected from naive symmetry considerations. That
is, the old contact point A and the new contact point
B on the cylinder’s bottom circular rim are never 180
degrees apart. Fig. 2 shows a histogram of a particular
cylinder’s orientations as we repeatedly ﬂicked the cylin-
der so it falls over onto the other side. The distribution
is strongly bimodal with no symmetric falls over many
repeated trials. There is clearly a breaking of apparent
symmetry.

Is this deviation from symmetry entirely due to our
imperfect hands that launched the cylinder? Here we
show that the breaking of apparent symmetry is con-
sistent with the simplest deterministic theory, namely
smooth non-collisional rigid body dynamics. We derive
formulas for the “angle of turn”, the angle subtended by
AB at the center of the cylinder’s bottom. These for-
mulas agree well with the casual table-top experiments
described above.

II. CANDIDATE THEORIES

If the table were perfectly planar and horizontal, the
cylinder’s bottom were perfectly planar, and the cylinder
were perfectly axisymmetric, the initial condition with a
purely righting angular velocity would result in a collision
in which all points on the cylinder’s bottom contact the
table-top simultaneously as the cylinder becomes verti-

cal. The consequence of such a collision will not be easy
to compute since algebraic rigid-body collision laws are
not well-deﬁned for truly simultaneous collisions [1]. In
any case, this situation of perfectness is physically un-
likely for a number of reasons.

Obviously, perfect ﬂatness or planarity is a physically
unlikely situation. Some possible geometric perturba-
tions to the cylinder are shown in Fig.3. Say we imag-
ine the cylinder to be solid and as having a nominally
ﬂat circular bottom. Then arbitrarily small geometric
perturbations, in the form of little bumps on either the
cylinder’s bottom or the table, will generically lead to
an initial two-point collision in this case (current con-
tact point + the small bump on the either surface), and
probably result in a cascade of further collisions because
of other little bumps on the nominally ﬂat surfaces. The
accurate prediction of the detailed consequences of such a
cascade of collisions is again hopeless. The consequences
of nominally simultaneous point collisions are notoriously
sensitive to the ordering of the collisions and other details
[2, 3, 4].

On the other hand, we can imagine the cylinder as not
being solid, but as having a through-hole. The cylinder’s
bottom would then simply consist of a circular rim. Ge-
ometric perturbations to the circular rim will similarly
lead to two-point collisions, where both points of contact
are now on the rim. We can then compute the conse-
quences of, say, a plastic collision at the new point of
contact. However, the consequences of the collisions will
again depend on the location of the geometric imper-
fection. So such a theory probably cannot be useful in
predicting a systematic breaking of symmetry as seen in
Fig.2, especially a symmetry-breaking that is invariant
to rotations of the cylinder’s initial conﬁguration about
the cylinder’s nominal symmetry axis.

The face-down simultaneous collision is unlikely even

FIG. 2: Typical toppled cylinder orientations A his-
togram on the circle showing the directions along which a
particular cylinder aligned itself in a total of 42 separate tri-
als. The cylinder always falls to one side or another, but
hardly ever to the diametrically opposite side corresponding
to 180 degrees. Whether it falls over to the left or to the right
of symmetric depends sensitively on initial conditions. The
distribution about 180 degrees is strongly bimodal. The left-
ward falls have a mean of about 33 degrees and the rightward
falls have a mean of about 37.9 degrees from the 180 degree
line. Theory predicts an angle of 40 degrees for frictionless
sliding and 22 degrees for rolling with no slip.

in the absence of imperfections in geometry and mass
distributions. After all, the cylinder is being launched
by imperfect human hands that will typically be unable
to provide an initial condition that will lead to the face
contacting the table. After accounting for various sym-
metries in the problem, it can be shown that the set
of all motions of a cylinder rolling without slip can be
characterized by three parameters. However, the set of
initial conditions that leads to a face-down collision can
be characterized with only two parameters (a set with co-
dimension one) [5, 6, 7]. So small generic perturbations of
a “collisional” initial condition typically results in a near-
collisional motion described entirely by the equations of
motion describing the smooth dynamics of the cylinder
rolling or sliding on its circular bottom rim. The rest of
this paper is about these near-collisional motions – mo-
tions that start from initial conditions arbitrarily close
to those that lead exactly to a face-down collision. We
will see that these near-collisional motions involve rapid
albeit continuous rolling or sliding of the cylinder on its
bottom rim, so that the contact point appears to have
switched by a ﬁnite angle, an angle not equal in general
to 180 degrees but always greater. For the analysis of
these near-collisional motions, we assume geometric per-
fectness of the cylinder and the table.

A special case of the results in this paper, namely that
of a disk rolling without slip and falling almost ﬂat on its
face (see section VIII), is discussed from a more sophis-
ticated mathematical perspective in a recent paper [7],
published as our paper was being prepared.

III. DYNAMICS OF ROCKING

Consider a cylinder with mass m, bottom radius R
[10], and the center of mass at a height H from the bot-
tom. The moment of inertia is C about it’s symmetry
axis and is A about any axis passing through the center
of mass and perpendicular to the symmetry axis. The
center of mass of the cylinder is (xG, yG, zG) in an iner-
tial frame ex-ey-ez at rest with respect to the table. The
reference orientation of the cylinder is vertical as shown
in Fig.4a. Any other orientation of the cylinder can be
obtained from the reference orientation by a sequence of
three rotations, deﬁning corresponding Euler angles as
illustrated in Fig.4 and angle rates. The ﬁrst rotation
(‘yaw’ or ‘steer’) is about ez by an angle ψ. This rota-
tion also transforms the inertial coordinate axes to ex1-
ey1-ez1. The second rotation (‘pitch’ or ‘tilt’) by an angle
φ about the ey1 axis results in the ex2-ey2-ez2 frame and
determines the orientation of the cylinder up to a rotation
about the body-ﬁxed symmetry axis (ez2 axis). The an-
gular velocity of the cylinder in the rotating ex2-ey2-ez2
frame is therefore entirely along the symmetry axis ez2
and this relative angular velocity magnitude is denoted
by ˙θ.

We will consider two simple extremes for the frictional
interaction between the table and the cylinder’s bottom,
namely, sliding without friction and rolling without slip.
The equations of motion that determine the evolution of
the orientation ψ, φ, and θ for a cylinder rolling without
slip is described by three second order ODEs:

These three equations represent angular momentum bal-
ance about the center of mass along the directions ex2,
ey2, and ez2, respectively. Because the cylinder rolls
without slip, the velocity of the center of mass is entirely
determined by the angular velocity and the orientation.
Thus, once the angle and the angle rates are known as
functions of time, the equations for the center of mass
velocity may be integrated to obtain the center of mass
position as a function of time.

The equations of motion for a cylinder sliding on its
circular bottom rim without friction are also given by

When the table is frictionless, the horizontal velocity of
the center of mass is a constant, so that the horizontal
position is independent of the orientation. The vertical
position of the center of mass is simply given by zG =
H cos φ + R sin φ. Thus, again, the motion of the center
of mass is determined by the evolution of the orientation.
We integrate these equations numerically to see what
the near-collision motions look like. We use an adaptive
time-step, stiﬀ integrator for the numerical integration.
A stiﬀ solver is indicated because we are interested in
studying (in hind-sight) solutions that have vastly diﬀer-
ent time-scales. Also, the fact that the particular Euler-
angle description used here is singular at the reference
conﬁguration makes the equations stiﬀ when the cylin-
der is almost vertical. This singularity need not particu-
larly concern us since we are only interested in the near-
collisional motions – the equations of motion are always
true despite the singularity.

For simplicity of presentation, we ﬁrst describe in de-
tail the results of integration when the cylinder does not
slip with respect to the table. First, we integrate the
equations with initial conditions that lead exactly to a
face-down collision ˙ψ(0) = ˙θ(0) = 0,
˙φ < 0, and say,
0 < φ < π/2. As would be expected, the cylinder rights
itself in a manner that all of its bottom face simultane-
ously reaches the horizontal table-top. The motion of the
cylinder is identical to that of an inverted pendulum with
the contact point A serving as the pivot point. Having
reached the vertical conﬁguration, the cylinder continues
to tilt in a pendular manner, penetrating the table-top.
This is, of course, because the equations of motion we
use do not have any means of detecting and responding
to a inter-penetration of two rigid bodies.

The equations of motion here do not have smooth
dependence of solutions on initial conditions. Exclu-
sively above-ground motions result from arbitrarily small
generic perturbations of these table-penetrating colli-

sional initial conditions. We set ˙ψ(0) = O(ǫ),
˙θ(0) =
O(ǫ), ˙φ < 0, and 0 < φ(0) < π/2, where ǫ is a small quan-
tity. The results of the integration are shown in Fig.5.
The plot of φ(t) suggests a motion in which the cylinder’s
bottom face periodically comes close to touching the ta-
ble (φ
0), but then gets “repelled” by the ﬂoor as if by
an elastic collision, so that the cylinder rocks down and
up periodically, ad inﬁnitum, without losing any energy
as would be expected from the conservative equations.

Note that we are simply simulating the apparently
smooth diﬀerential equations, and not applying an al-
gebraic transition rule for a collision. Despite the large
angle rates the angular velocity is always bounded, as
it must be since energy remains a constant throughout
the motion. In particular, while the angle rates ˙θ and ˙ψ
are large, they are very close to being equal and opposite

Let us examine the consequences of a rapid ﬁnite
change in ψ when φ

Given that xG, yG, zG do not change much during the
brief near-collisional phase (because center of mass ve-
locity is ﬁnite), we can see from Eq. 5 that a rapid con-
tinuous change in ψ corresponds to a rapid continuous
change in the contact point in a circle with the center
O(xG, yG, 0). Thus the “angle of turn” AOB deﬁned ear-
lier is simply the change in ψ. At the singular limit of
a near-collisional motion arbitrarily close to a collisional
motion, this continuous but steep change in ψ approaches
a step change – this is the “limiting angle of turn” and
we denote this by ∆ψturn.

In summary, we ﬁnd that the near-collisional motion
of the no-slip cylinder can be characterized as being the
pasting-together of two qualitatively distinct motions of
vastly diﬀerent time-scales:

1. inverted pendulum-like motion about an essentially
ﬁxed contact point when the tilt angle φ is large.

2. rapid rolling of the cylinder which accomplishes in
inﬁnitesimal time, a ﬁnite change in contact point,
and a redirection of the downward tilt velocity ˙φ to
an equal but opposite upward tilt velocity.

Note that the near-collisional motion for a cylinder
rolling without slip requires very high friction forces
(Fig. 5g). However, plotting the ratio of the required fric-
tion forces with the normal reaction, we ﬁnd that only a
ﬁnite coeﬃcient of friction is required for preventing slip
even in the collisional limit (Fig. 5h).

The other extreme of exactly zero friction is quite sim-
ilar. Here, since the horizontal component of the center
of mass velocity is a constant due to a lack of friction, we
can assume without loss of generality that the horizontal
center of mass velocity is zero. Then the near collisional
motions for a cylinder sliding without friction can again
be characterized as consisting of two qualitatively diﬀer-
ent phases:

1. a tipping phase when φ is not too small, involving
the cylinder moving in a vertical plane, the center of
mass moving only vertically, and the contact point
slipping without friction.

2. a rapid sliding phase in which the sign of

˙φ is
reversed almost discontinuously, and the contact
point moves by a ﬁnite angle in inﬁnitesimal time.

The angle of turn for the frictionless case and the no-
slip case are diﬀerent in general. In the next two sections,
we derive the formulas for the angle of turn by taking into
account the two-phase structure of the near-collisional
motion.

IV. ANGLE OF TURN FOR NO-SLIP ROLLING

The rigid body dynamics of disks, cylinders, and simi-
lar objects with special symmetries, have been discussed
at length by a number of authors, including distinguished
mechanicians such as Chaplygin, Appell, and Korteweg.
Their works include complete analytical characteriza-
tions of the solutions to the relevant equations of motion,
typically involving non-elementary functions such as the
hyper-geometric. Reasonable reviews of such literature
can be found, for instance, in [5] and [6]. We will not
use these somewhat cumbersome general solutions but
will analyze only the special near-collisional motion of
interest to us.

The calculation below is called, variously, a boundary
layer calculation, a matched asymptotics calculation (but
we are not interested in an explicit matching) or a singu-
lar perturbation calculation. Essentially, we take advan-
tage of the presence of two dynamical regimes with vastly
diﬀerent time-scales, each regime simple to analyze by it-
self. The overall motion can be obtained approximately
by suitably pasting together the small-φ and the large-φ
solutions. But the angle of turn is entirely determined
by the small-φ regime, as will be seen below.

The equations of motion for no-slip rolling, obviously,
conserve total mechanical energy. Also, the total angu-
lar momentum H/G about the line joining the center of
mass G and the table-cylinder contact point (say P) is

conserved because both gravity and the contact force al-
ways intersect this line by deﬁnition. Therefore,

H/G.rP G = AR ˙ψ sin φ + CH( ˙θ + ˙ψ cos φ)

= b1, say.

If we assume initial conditions that almost lead to a face-
˙ψ(0) = O(ǫ1) = ˙θ(0) << 1, we have
down collision,
b1 = O(ǫ1). So rearranging Eq.7, we have:

˙θ + ˙ψ cos φ =

˙ψ sin φ + O(ǫ1)

(8)

In the limit of small φ, we use sin φ = φ and cos φ = 1 to
obtain

˙ψ + ˙θ =

φ ˙ψ + O(ǫ1).

(9)

Since φ << 1, this equation is the near-unity of the ratio
˙ψ and ˙θ that we noticed in the numerical simulations
of
(Fig.5i).

Now consider Eq.1 with i = 1 in the limit of small φ, so
that we can replace sin φ = φ and cos φ = 1. We obtain

This is the limiting angle of turn when the cylinder rocks
by rolling without slip. Earlier numerical integrations
agree quite well with this formula in the limit, as they
should.

V. ANGLE OF TURN FOR FRICTIONLESS
SLIDING

We now brieﬂy outline the procedure for deriving the
angle of turn for the frictionless case. The procedure
closely parallels that described for the no-slip case, except
for small diﬀerences below. The frictionless equations
Eq.1 and Eq.3 corresponding to i = 3 simpliﬁes to

Here, as before, b1 << 1 because ˙θ(0) and ˙ψ(0) are sim-
ilarly much less than unity by assumption. Using Eq.25
in the frictionless equation Eq.1 and Eq.3 corresponding
to i = 1, we have, after some simpliﬁcations:

Substituting this into the i = 2 frictionless equation and
simplifying by neglecting all higher order φ terms, we
eventually have

VI. QUANTITATIVE COMPARISONS

×

Firsly and most signiﬁcantly, note that the limiting an-
gle of turn does not depend on the initial conditions such
as the initial tilt and tip velocity. This means that we
do not have to control these in an experiment. This also
agrees with the relatively small variance in the histogram
of Fig.2, in which I did not control the initial conditions.
The histogram Fig. 2 was obtained using a cylinder
10−3 m2.
with R = 5.1 cm, H = 6.9 cm, A/m = 5.13
Using these numbers in the angle of turn formulas gives
an angle of turn of about 220 degrees for frictionless slid-
ing and an angle of turn of 202 degrees for rolling without
slip. These angles of turn would manifest as a deviation
of either 40 degrees or 22 degrees from falling over exactly
diametrically. In the toppling experiment of Fig. 2, the
cylinder orientation was 33 degrees on average from 180
degrees in the leftward falls (suggesting an angle of turn
of 213 degrees) and was about 37.9 degrees on average
from 180 degrees in the rightward falls (suggesting angle
of turn of 217.9 degrees). The standard deviations were
respectively 3.9 and 4.5 degrees respectively. Clearly, nei-
ther the frictionless limit nor the no-slip limit is accurate.
But both limits capture the many qualitative aspects of
the motion quite well. The experimental angle of turn is
better predicted by the asymptotic formula for friction-
less sliding in this case.

VII. SPECIAL LIMIT: TALL THIN CYLINDERS

For tall thin cylinders with A

mH 2 and H >> R,
both equations for the angle of turn, Eq.24 and Eq.28,

∼

tend to π radians. That is, very tall cylinders are pre-
dicted to have a smaller symmetry-breaking. This pre-
diction agrees with the common experience that when
we tip a tall-enough cylinder (something that looks more
like cylindrical stick or rod) in a manner that its bottom
surface falls ﬂat, the cylinder essentially falls over on a
contact point diametrically opposite to the initial con-
tact point. Thus this apparent symmetric falling-over
is accomplished by a rapid asymmetric rolling or sliding
of the cylinder over roughly one half of its bottom rim!
And this result seems independent of the cylinder-table
frictional properties.

VIII. SPECIAL LIMIT: DISKS

We may deﬁne a disk as a cylinder with zero height:
H = 0. If the radius of gyration of a disk is Rg = kR,
then C = mR2k2 and A = mR2k2/2. Substituting these
in either equation for the angle of turn, Eq.24 or Eq.28,
we obtain

∆ψturn = π

2 + k2/k.

Indeed, numerical exploration with a viscous friction-law
that spans the range between zero friction and coulomb’s
law indicates that the angle of turn is independent of the
friction law for disks. The formula above for the special
case of the near-collisional motion of pure-rolling disks is
also derived in a recent paper [7], published as this paper
was being prepared.

A homogeneous disk has k = 1/√2. The correspond-
ing angle of turn is equal to π√5
2.23π, which is a
little (41 degrees) over 360 degrees, a full rotation of the
contact point. This prediction is easily conﬁrmed in ca-
sual experimentation with metal caps of large-mouthed
bottles on sturdy tables – for such bottle caps, we ob-
serve that the new contact point is invariably quite close
to the old contact point.

which is a little less than 360 degrees (48 degrees). Thus
the apparent near-collisional behavior of a homogeneous
disk and a ring will be superﬁcially similar, even though
the actual angle of turn diﬀer by about 90 degrees.

The angle of turn be controlled by adjusting k. For
instance, it is possible to increase the theoretical angle of
0, a disk in which
turn without bound by choosing k
almost all the mass is concentrated at the center. But
it would perhaps be hard to experimentally obtain large
angles of turn due to frictional losses.

IX. SUMMARY

Here we analyzed what happens when a cylinder or
a disk falls ﬂat on its bottom face. We found that the
smallest deviation from a perfect face-down collision of a
cylinder’s bottom results in a rapid rolling and/or slid-
ing motion in which the contact point moves through a
ﬁnite angle in inﬁnitesimal time. Calculations of this ﬁ-
nite angle explain certain apparent symmetry breaking
in experiments involving rocking or toppled cylinders.

Flatness and colliding with a ﬂat face is variously de-
generate. The consequences of such a degenerate col-
lision can depend sensitively on initial conditions. So,
for instance, roboticists that build biped robots simplify
control and improve predictability of foot falls by using
curved and compliant feet rather than ﬂat rigid feet (e.g.,
[8]).

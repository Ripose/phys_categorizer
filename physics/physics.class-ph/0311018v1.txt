We study the bandgap structure of two-dimensional photonic crystals created by a triangular
lattice of rotated hexagonal holes, and explore the eﬀects of the reduced symmetry in the unit-cell
geometry on the value of the absolute bandgap and the frequencies of localized defect modes. We
reveal that a maximum absolute bandgap for this structure is achieved for an intermediate rotation
angle of the holes. This angle depends on the radius of the holes and the refractive index of the
background material. We also study the properties of the defect modes created by missing holes,
and discuss the mode tunability in such structures.

During recent years we observe a rapidly growing
interest in the design and fabrication of novel types
of photonic-crystal structures possessing large absolute
band gaps. The study of various geometries of three-
dimensional photonic crystals and diﬀerent ways to en-
large their absolute bandgaps is a key issue of the physics
of periodic dielectric structures where diﬀerent polariza-
tions of light are coupled together and, therefore, the ex-
istence of an absolute bandgap is crucially important for
various applications of three-dimensional photonic crys-
tals in optics (see. e.g., Ref. [1] and references therein).
However, for two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystals
Maxwell’s equations are known to decouple eﬀectively for
two polarizations, so that the study of a particular pho-
tonic bandgap of such periodic structures can be carried
out independently for both E-polarized and H-polarized
electromagnetic waves. Accordingly, two types of pho-
tonic bandgaps are usually distinguished to exist for dif-
ferent polarizations. When the bandgaps for two diﬀerent
polarizations overlap, they create the combined bandgap
known as an absolute bandgap.

One of the main reasons to enlarge the absolute
bandgaps and to study the bandgap properties of 2D
periodic photonic structures is an attractive possibility
of creating novel types of tunable waveguides and cir-
cuits for applications of photonic crystals in integrated
In particular, the existence of a large absolute

bandgap would allow to design the waveguides in planar
structures which can support propagating modes of both
polarizations in the same frequency domain.

Up to now, a number of diﬀerent approaches has been
suggested for the enlargement of the absolute bandgaps of
2D photonic-crystal structures. One of these approaches
relies on the idea of using the photonic crystals created
by a two-dimensional lattice of non-circular holes and ex-
ploring the symmetry-reducing properties of 2D photonic
crystals for the bandgap enlargement [2]–[12]. In partic-
ular, Wang et al. [11] demonstrated that the absolute
bandgap becomes maximal in the case of air holes of the

same symmetry as the lattice symmetry. For example,
the bandgap takes a maximum value for a triangular lat-
tice of rotated hexagonal holes. However, Qui et al. [10]
suggested that the bandgap as large as that demonstrated
in Ref. [11] can be achieved in 2D photonic crystals cre-
ated by air holes of more complex, non-circular shape
without any rotation.

In spite of many studies of the absolute bandgaps
of photonic crystals created by a lattice of non-circular
holes, no speciﬁc applications of such large bandgaps
have been discussed and demonstrated.
In particular,
the usual statement that large absolute bandgaps should
be useful for functioning of photonic circuits is not well-
grounded. As a matter of fact, there is no solid reason to
exploit the absolute bandgaps in two-dimensional struc-
tures unless photonic-crystal circuits guide light of both
polarizations, but the study of defect modes and waveg-
uides in such structures is still incomplete or missing.

The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we explore
further the concept of the enlargement of the absolute
bandgaps of 2D photonic crystals through reducing sym-
metry in the unit-cell geometry taking as an example a
2D dielectric periodic structure created by a a triangular
lattice of rotated hexagonal holes. In particular, we re-
veal that in such 2D structures large absolute bandgaps
can be achieved for an intermediate value of the rotation
angle of the hexagonal holes. Second, we demonstrate
that, by using 2D photonic crystals with a large abso-
lute bandgap, it is possible to create defects which can
support localized modes for both polarizations of light,
so that the waveguides based on such defects can guide
light of both polarizations as well.

We consider a 2D photonic crystal created by a tri-
angular lattice of hexagonal holes assuming an arbitrary
rotation of the hole relative to the lattice symmetry axis,
as shown in Fig. 1(a). The photonic band gap is calcu-
lated by solving Maxwell’s equations, by means of the
plane-wave expansion method [13]. Two examples of the
photonic bandgap structure of such a photonic crystal

Our main goal here is to study the eﬀect of the hole rota-
tion on the value of the (lowest-order) absolute band gap.
The results can naturally be compared with the bandgap
spectra of the 2D structures created by circular holes, as
well as with the case when the hexagonal holes are not
rotated, see Fig. 1(b).

In Fig. 2 we show the dependence of the normalized
width of the absolute bandgap for two types of triangu-
lar lattices created by circular and hexagonal holes, as
the functions of the normalized radius, r/a. We make
this type of comparison for diﬀerent values of the rota-
tion angle of the hexagonal lattices, such that the rota-
tion for the hexagonal holes is chosen to maximize the
absolute bandgap at a given radius. In all the cases we
conﬁrm that the hexagonal lattices possess a larger abso-
lute bandgap, and this bandgap depends strongly on the
hexagon orientation.

As a matter of fact, we observe that the absolute
bandgap can be enlarged dramatically by employing the
concept of local symmetry reduction in the unit cell of
the structure, and using hexagonal holes instead of circu-
lar holes to reduce the rotational symmetry. In this latter
case, the bandgap depends strongly on the rotation angle
of the holes. In brief, our ﬁndings can be summarized as
follows. First, the maximal bandgap is achieved for some
intermediate (critical) angle of rotation; in the case of the
hexagonal holes in the material with ǫ = 12, this criti-

cal angle is close to the value 24o. Second, the critical
angle θcr depends on the value of the dielectric constant
ǫ of the photonic-crystal material, but it varies slowly
near this intermediate value. Figures 3(a,b) show the
maximum value of the absolute bandgap ∆ω/ω and the
variation of the critical angle θcr of the rotated hexagonal
holes on the value of the dielectric permittivity ǫ of the
photonic crystal material. It is therefore clear that this
critical rotation angle is not a fundamental constant of
the structure, but it is deﬁned by some eﬀective geometry
and material properties corresponding to the maximum
eﬀect of the local symmetry reducing in the unit-cell ge-
ometry, similar to the eﬀects discussed in Ref.
[10] for
a complete diﬀerent problem. Moreover, the absolute
bandgap varies dramatically for relatively small values of
ǫ, whereas it saturates for large ǫ, and the critical angle
approaches the value 21o.

As we mentioned above, in the case of 2D periodic
dielectric structures, both E- and H-polarization com-
ponents of the electromagnetic ﬁeld are decoupled.
In
this case, the existence of large absolute bandgaps can be
useful to support localized modes for both polarizations

of light, and that the waveguides based on such defects
can guide light of both polarizations as well. Therefore,
in order to employ some practical advantages of using
the properties of the absolute bandgaps in 2D photonic
structures, we should explore the properties of the de-
fect modes and waveguides created in such types of pho-
tonic crystals. To be practically useful, such waveguides
should be tolerant to the fabrication disorder, so that
two-dimensional photonic structures created by a lattice
of holes seem to be the best suited structures where defect
modes and waveguides can be fabricated making some
missing holes.

Figure 4(a) shows the spectrum of localized defect
modes supported by a triangular lattice of hexagonal
holes, for the case when the lattice is created by the holes
rotated by 23.7o, and the bandgap takes its maximum
value. As follows from these results, the defect created
by a missing rotated hole can support simultaneously lo-
calized modes of both TE and TM polarizations, allowing
for an eﬀective manipulation of light in photonic-crystal
circuits based on this type of defects. Additionally, in
Fig. 4(b) we show how the absolute bandgap and the de-
fect frequencies vary with a change of the rotation angle
θ, at the ﬁxed value of the hole radius r/a = 0.43 deﬁned

in Fig. 1(a). From the results presented in Fig. 4(b) it
follows that the frequencies of the defect modes inside
the absolute bandgap are almost constant for all angles.
Our results show that the similar features are ob-
served for the waveguides created in the lower-symmetry
photonic crystals possessing a large absolute photonic
bandgap: the possibility to enlarge the bandgap in a 2D
photonic structures created by rotated hexagonal holes
allows such waveguides to support the guided modes of
both polarization, and their bandgap properties can be
easily manipulated. This problem will be addressed in
our future publications.

In conclusion, we have presented the results of engi-
neering of the absolute bandgaps in 2D photonic crystals
for photonic-circuit applications, for the example of a
photonic crystal created by a triangular lattice of hexag-
onal holes. We have revealed that the maximum value of
the absolute bandgap in this structure can be achieved
when all hexagonal holes are rotated by a ﬁnite angle,
and this rotation angle takes an intermediate value be-
tween the values corresponding to the simplest symme-
tries of the lattice. The critical rotation angle depends
on the parameters of photonic crystals, but it is shown to
be almost constant for large values of the dielectric per-
mittivity. Moreover, the frequencies of the defect modes
which can be supported by missing holes in such struc-
tures do not vary much with the hole rotation and chang-
ing the value of the absolute bandgap.

We believe that our results will be important for a de-
sign of the photonic-crystal waveguides and circuits sup-
porting propagating guided modes of both polarizations
in the same frequency domain, as well as for the study
of nonlinear waveguides where the intensity-induced cou-
pling between the modes of diﬀerent polarization can be
controlled through the rotation of holes or non-circular
defects. In addition, we believe that our results can be
useful for a design of novel types of coupled-resonator op-
tical waveguides with the properties which can be tuned
by using rotated hexagonal holes instead of circular holes.
In addition, we would like to mention that large ab-
solute bandgaps can be very useful for exploring nonlin-
ear properties of photonic crystals, when the intensity-
dependent refractive index of the waveguides can be em-
ployed to couple the ﬁeld polarizations. In this case, we
can create nonlinear photonic-crystal circuits where one
polarization is used for the signal transmission, whereas
the other polarization is employed for controlling the sig-
nal propagation, in order to realize switching between
diﬀerent transmission regimes, etc.

Abstract

In the superconducting medium the circular current supported by its own mag-
netic ﬁeld can exist giving rise to the possible underlying mechanism for the ball
lightning.

The example of such self-supporting object is provided by superconducting circular
current around the tube of the torus as shown in Fig.1. The current consists of charged
particles moving in a circle of radius r. It is worth mentioning that such a motion is two-
dimensional the necessary condition for the superconductivity [1] thus being satisﬁed.
The centrifugal force is balanced by the Lorentz one so

γ = (1 − β2)−1/2,

where µ is the magnetic permeability of the medium, m is the rest mass of the particle, e
is its charge, and γ is the Lorentz factor. It must be taken into account because the ball
lightning is luminous object the particle velocity v thus being close to the light one c (the
radiation is synchrotronic in the case under consideration). The magnetic ﬁeld within the
tube of the torus is [2]

It is practically homogeneous when r ≪ R thus ensuring the circular motion of the
particles. The current strength I is

Putting Eqs. (2) and (3) into Eq.(1) we obtain the following connection between the

particle number N and the radius of the torus

and the following expression for the magnetic ﬁeld

The energy of the object under consideration is the sum of the magnetic ﬁeld one

and the kinetic energy of the moving charges

the total energy thus being

To get the expression (6) we used the relation γ2β2 = γ2 − 1, see Eq.(1).

The Lorentz factor γ can be determined from the observed angular frequency of the

synchrotron radiation [2]

In this way we get

where λ is the wavelength of the radiation. The intensity of the radiation is [2]

.

The calculations are performed assuming the charged particles to be electrons and
putting µ = 1. The average observed diameter of the ball lightning (hereafter BL’s) is
24 cm [3, 4], but twice as large diameters are also observed rather often [4, 7]. For this
reason the results are obtained for both the R = 12 cm and R = 24 cm values of the

torus radius. The tube radii are quite arbitrarily chosen as r = (1, 2, 3)cm. It is worth
mentioning in this connection that the sphere is not the only observed form of the BL’s:
many diﬀerent forms including the torus are also observed [5]. The intervals of the Lorentz
factor values are determined for the visible light region running from λ = 7 · 10−5cm (red)
to λ = 3.8 · 10−5cm (violet) because the observed BL colours cover all this region [3].

The results are shown in Table 1. Two features are important.

bounds of each interval refer to the red and violet lights respectively.

a. The energies are rather large, being practically the same as the average value of

100 kJ for the outdoors observations of BL’s [6].

b. At the same time the intensity of the radiation is rather small. Both these features

are characteristic for the exploding BL’s [5].

In this way we showed that the object with the similar properties to those of the
exploding BL’s can exist in the superconducting medium (the superconductivity must be
high-temperature since there is no reasons to assume the temperatures of BL’s to be low).
We do not know whether such a medium arises in the atmospheric processes leading to
the BL’s (this problem is out of the scope of the present work), but the above results
suggest that the exploding BL’s may be a possible evidence of this phenomenon.

The author is greatly indebted to Professor O.I. Sumbaev for the permanent attention

to this work and Drs. V.L. Alexeev and A.I. Egorov for stimulating discussions.

Abstract. Recent theoretical results show the existence of arbitrary speeds (0 ≤ v < ∞)
solutions of all relativistic wave equations. Some recent experiments conﬁrm the results
for sound waves. The question arises naturally: What is the appropriate geometry of
spacetime to describe superluminal phenomena? In this paper we present a spacetime
model that incorporates the valid results of Relativity Theory and yet describes coherently
superluminal phenomena without paradoxes.

1. INTRODUCTION.

Recently it was found that wave equations admit solutions which describe waves prop-
agating slower or faster than the velocity appearing in the equation in question ([1–6]),
and there are experiments proving the existence of such waves in the case of sound (su-
personic waves) [7]. As a particular case, the Maxwell equations, too, admit subluminal
and superluminal wave solutions with arbitrary speed. If such superluminal phenomena
exist in Nature then we must reapprise our notions about synchronization, future, past
etc. The need of synchronizations diﬀerent from the standard one emerged from the
point of view of tachyons [8–10] but the possibility of superluminal phenomena oﬀers
another way.

Now we try to establish the structure of spacetime deriving from the existence of su-
perluminal phenomena. Our treatment is somewhat diﬀerent from the usual approaches
based on coordinates and transformation rules. The mathematical structure of general
relativity based on global analysis on manifolds taught us that instead of relative quan-
tities (coordinates, electric and magnetic ﬁeld etc) and their transformation rules, we
have to work with absolute quantities (spacetime, electromagnetic ﬁeld etc.) and their
splitting according to observers (in time and space, in electric and magnetic ﬁeld etc.).
There are such treatments of non-relativistic spacetime and special relativistic spacetime
[11–14] which show very well that the point of view of absolute objects admits a clear and
simple presentation and excludes the possibility of misunderstanding because the rigor-
ous mathematical structure rules out intuitive notions. In the usual approach observers
(reference frames), coordinate systems are intuitive notions and one uses ”natural” tacit
assumptions. A good example for a misleading tacit assumption is that ”if he moves
at velocity v relative to you then you moves at velocity −v relative to him”. It turns
out, however, that this does not hold in the special relativistic spacetime (see ref. [12],
§ II.4.2); the velocity addition paradox [15] is the consequence of this incorrect tacit
assumption.

It is often emphasized that coordinates are labels, not physical entities. On the con-
trary, splitting of spacetime, spacetime vectors, tensors etc. has a physical meaning:
the split quantities describe how an observer perceives absolute objects (the splitting of
spacetime by an observer gives the time and the space of the observer, the splitting of
electromagnetic ﬁeld gives the observed electric and magnetic ﬁeld etc.)

2. PRELIMINARIES.

We intend to deﬁne a mathematical model of spacetime based on experimental facts
and theoretical assumptions. The basic experimental facts regarding inertial reference
frames (observers) are the following. Observers in diﬀerent inertial reference frames
measure time by the “same” clocks and synchronization process and measure space by
the “same” rods. The term “same” means a prescription such as: time is measured by
the oscillations of a cubic crystal consisting of a given number of molecules of a given
material (e.g. quartz), and space is measure by a sideline of that crystal. Then it is
2

found that
1. Time has

2. Space has

a) a one dimensional aﬃne structure (time translations are meaningful),
b) an orientation (past and future are distinct);

a) a three dimensional aﬃne structure (space translations are meaningful),
b) an orientation (right and left are distinct by the decay of K mesons),
c) a Euclidean structure (distances and angles are meaningful).

3. The aﬃne structures of time and space are related to each other by uniform motions
on straight lines; uniform motion relative to an inertial reference frame seems a uniform
motion relative to another inertial reference frame also.
4. Time and space in a given inertial reference frame are related to time and space of
other reference frames (transformation rules).

Then 1, 2a, 2b and 3 suggest that spacetime is a four dimensional oriented aﬃne space.
The other structures are deduced from 3 and 4; the diﬀerent spacetime models come
from the diﬀerent meaning of Euclidean structures on the inertial reference frame spaces
and from the transformation rules. However, instead of the explicit use of the transfor-
mation rules it is convenient to refer to simpler and more transparent facts expressed in
the transformation rules. For instance, in the non-relativistic case we accept

4NR. Absolute time and absolute Euclidean structure (on absolute simultaneous space-

time points) exist.

In the special relativistic case we accept that
4SR. There exists a propagation mode of electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations, solution
of Maxwell equations, and denominated light, which is absolute (independent of the
source) and is described by a Lorentzian structure (involving the Euclidean structure).
Then in the non-relativistic spacetime model (NRM) and in the special relativistic
spacetime model (SRM) built up on the corresponding assumptions, it becomes a quasi
trivial fact that 4NR and 4SR imply the Galilean and the Lorentzian transformation
rules, respectively (see [12], § I.8.2.5 and § II.7.1.6.).

Light phenomena are not well described in the NRM; superluminal phenomena are
not well described in the SRM. Thus if we want to treat superluminal phenomena, we
have to construct a new spacetime model which, similarly to the known cases, will be
built up on straightforward theoretical assumptions resulting in a deﬁnite transformation
rule. Now we accept that

4W. a) Light propagation (in the luminal model—see § 3.2) is absolute (independent
of source),
b) There exist electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations (EFC) that can propagate at arbi-
trary speeds with respect to material objects (observers),
c) there are electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations which cannot be at rest with respect
to material objects (observers).

3

4Wb and 4Wc are suggested by the recent theoretical investigations of [2–6] showing

the existence of arbitrary speeds (o ≤ v < ∞) solutions of Maxwell equations.

3. CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW SPACETIME MODEL.

3.1 Absolute simultaneity.
As it is mentioned, we start with the fact that spacetime is a four dimensional oriented

aﬃne space M (over the vector space M).

The possibility of EFC of arbitrary speeds allows us to establish an absolute simul-
taneity S on M by a limit procedure using EFC whose speed tends to inﬁnity. Abso-
lute simultaneity is an equivalence relation on M ; then the set of simultaneity classes,
I := M/S is absolute time, the canonical surjection τ : M → I is time evaluation.

It is not a hard assumption that simultaneity classes are parallel hyperplanes, which
implies the existence of a three dimensional linear subspace E of M such that τ (x) =
τ (x + E) for all x ∈ M . Then I := M/E is a one dimensional vector space and I becomes
an aﬃne space over I by the subtraction (x + E) − (y + E) := x − y + E. Then the time
evaluation τ will be an aﬃne map over the canonical linear surjection τ : M → I. Keep
in mind that E is the kernel of τ , i.e. τ · x = 0 if and only if x ∈ E.

E is the vector space of absolute spacelike vectors; from property 2b in the previous
paragraph we accept that there is an orientation on E. The orientation of M and the
orientation of E determine an orientation of I as follows. Let (e0, e1, e2, e3) be a positively
oriented basis of M such that (e1, e2, e3) is a positively oriented basis of E. Then τ ·e0 is
considered to be positive in I. It is not hard to see that the deﬁnition of the orientation
of I does not depend on the basis. The orientation of I gives the orientation (an ordering)
of I which we interpret expressing future and past: t′ is later than t if t′ − t > 0.

Recapitulating our results, we have

• spacetime, a four dimensional oriented aﬃne space M (over the vector space M),
• absolute time, a one dimensional oriented aﬃne space I (over the vector space I),
• time evaluation, an aﬃne surjection τ : M → I (over the linear map τ : M → I),
and E := Kerτ .

We call attention to the following fact: in usual treatments time is considered to be
the real line but, evidently, e.g. the real number 3 is neither a time point nor a time
period; we have got that time is an oriented one dimensional aﬃne space I and time
periods are positive elements of the oriented one dimensional vector space I; we shall see
that distances, too, will be positive elements of an oriented one dimensional vector space
D. Oriented one dimensional vector spaces will be called measure lines. We need the
products and quotients of elements of diﬀerent measure lines; e.g. if m ∈ D and s ∈ I, we
need m/s. There is a convenient mathematical expression of such products and quotients
(see Introduction of ref. [11]) which is not detailed here because formally we can apply
the well known rules of multiplication and division.

3.2 Absolute velocities.

4

We have got M , I and τ which form a part of NRM (see § I.1 of [11]); so we can
use all the notions of NRM that do not refer to the Euclidean structure. In particular,
r : I → M is a world line function, if τ (r(t)) = t for all t ∈ I. Then its derivative, the
absolute velocity has the property τ · ˙r(t) = 1; correspondingly,

(1)

V (1) :=

u ∈

τ · u = 1

(cid:26)

(cid:27)

M
I (cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

is the set of absolute velocities.

In contrast to the NRM, in our theory not all world lines are allowed as histories of
mass points. According to our assumption 4W.c, the possible particle velocities form a
non void subset P of V (1). The elements of P , ∂P and V (1) \ P are called particle (or
subluminal) velocities, luminal velocities and superluminal velocities, respectively. Keep
in mind that here velocity means absolute velocity.

We suppose that P is open and connected. A reference frame is a smooth map
U : M → P .1 Then the space of the reference frame is as in NRM: it consists of
the integral curves of the vector ﬁeld U . Each one of the integral lines of U is called
an observer. Inertial reference frames are the ones having constant value. In the
following we shall deal only with inertial reference frames, so we omit the term inertial,
and we refer to an inertial observer by its constant value, so we say, e.g., an observer
u ∈ P . The u-space consists of the straight lines parallel to u; thus a u-space point is
of the form x + u ⊗ I for some x ∈ M .

3.3 Observer times.
The ﬂow of time as registered by physical clocks are diﬀerent depending on the motion
of the clocks. (This is an experimental fact [14,17].) Consider the world lines of two
(pointlike) clocks with velocity u and uo, respectively. Establish a synchronization of the
clocks by an ”inﬁnitely” fast superluminal signal. Later the synchronization is repeated,
and it is found that the times registered by to the clocks between the two synchronizations
are diﬀerent. Because of the aﬃne structure of observer times (property 1a in § 2) this
means that to every u ∈ P there is a positive number κu in such a way that the time
elapsed between the absolute timepoints t1 and t2 along the world line with velocity value
u equals

t2−t1
κu .

Now we conceive that the observers in u considers time I to have an aﬃne structure

with the u-subtraction

(2)

(t2 − t1)u :=

t2 − t1
κu

1This deﬁnition is the one used in [13,14,15,12]. Note that what we deﬁne as a reference frame has

been called observer in [11,12].

5

3.4 Observer spaces.
Spaces of diﬀerent reference frames are diﬀerent. However, all the reference frames
spaces can be made an aﬃne space over the same vector space E. Take two u-lines q1
and q2 (representing the endpoints of a rod resting in u-space). Then the vector between
simultaneous points of q2 and q1 is independent of time. In NRM where the Euclidean
structure is taken to be absolute, this vector is accepted to be the diﬀerence of q2 and
q1, deﬁning the aﬃne structure of the observer space. Now we take into account that
the Euclidean structure depends on observers. Let us consider two sets of observers, in
two frames uo and u, both having a resting rod of the same length d (the number of
molecules of the given crystal along the rod is the same). Now the observer in u marks
the endpoints of the uo-rod at a given instant (i.e. simultaneously) and measures the
distance between the marks and ﬁnds eventually that it does not equal d. Thus the two
observers assign diﬀerent vectors in E to the ”same” rod.

In view of the fact 2a in paragraph 2, we assume that this diﬀerence can be expressed

by a linear map which means the following.

To every u ∈ P there is given a linear bijection Au : E → E in such a way that
the observer space Eu (the set of straight lines parallel to u) is equipped with an aﬃne
structure by the subtraction

(3)

q2 − q1 := Au · (x2 − x1)

(x2 ∈ q2, x1 ∈ q1, τ (x2) = τ (x1))

Since E is oriented, there is an E∧E∧E valued canonical translation invariant measure
on E such that the polyhedron spanned by the positively oriented basis (e1, e2, e3) equals
e1 ∧ e2 ∧ e3. E ∧ E ∧ E is an oriented one dimensional vector space, so we can take its
cubic root D (see § IV.4. of [11]). Evidently, the elements of E ∧ E ∧ E are interpreted
as volume values, so the elements of D are distances.

According to item 2c in paragraph 2, every observer u has a Euclidean structure bu.
If r and ro are the same (arbitrary) rods in u-space and uo-space, respectively, then they
have the same length according to u and uo, respectively. Thus the Euclidean structures
of the observer spaces deﬁne a unique Euclidean structure b : E × E → D ⊗ D such that
bu(r, r) = b(Au · r, Au · r).

3.5 Continuity.
The speciﬁc meaning of the set of particle velocities P in V (1) is reﬂected by the fact,
that we require u → κu and u → Au to be continuous and continuously inextensible to
the points of ∂P in such a way that they remain positive and non-degenerate, respectively.

3.6 The new spacetime model.
Recapitulating our results, we see that we have got the Euclidean structure on E, so
all the items of NRM are present, and further structures are introduced. We have as a
new spacetime model

(M, I, τ, D, b, P, κ, A)
6

where

• (M, I, τ, D, b) is a NRM (in which the set V (1) of absolute velocities is deﬁned),
and
• P ⊂ V (1) is a nonvoid connected open subset,
• κ : P → R+, u 7→ κu,
• A : P → GL(E), u 7→ Au

are continuous functions which cannot be extended continuously to the points of ∂P .

3.7 Notations.
The action of a linear map is denoted by a dot e.g τ · x. In the following, instead of b
we shall write a dot product, too, i.e. q · r := b(q, r); furthermore, we put |q|2 := b(q, q)
for qr ∈ E, and similar notations will be applied for the induced Euclidean structure on
E
I etc (see § I.1.4.2 of [11]). If one treats linear maps and bilinear maps as tensors then
all these dots correspond to contractions and no ambiguity arises.

4. SOME FORMULAE IN THE NEW SPACETIME MODEL.

4.1. Splitting of spacetime.
Observers in the reference frame u ∈ P splits spacetime into time and space in such a
way that to a spacetime point x they assigns the corresponding absolute timepoint and
the u-spacepoint that x is incident with, i.e. the u-splitting of spacetime is the map

(4)

Hu : M → I × Eu,

x 7→ (x + E, x + u ⊗ I).

This splitting is the same as in NRM. However, since the aﬃne structure of Eu diﬀers
from that in NRM, and we have to consider the aﬃne structure of I depending on the
observer (see 3.4.),now we ﬁnd that Hu is an aﬃne map over the linear map

which we call the u-splitting of vectors.

4.2 Relative velocities.
A world line function represents the history of a mass point or a light ray signal in
spacetime. An observer perceives this history as a motion. The motion relative to the
reference frame u ∈ P corresponding to the world line function r is described by the
function ru which assigns to a timepoint t the u-space point that r(t) is incident with:

(6)

(7)

ru : I → Eu,

t 7→ r(t) + u ⊗ I.

The velocity of the motion relative to the observer is obtained by

lim
t2→t1

ru(t2) − ru(t1)
(t2 − t1)u

= κuAu · ( ˙r(t1) − u).

P then

(10)

or

(11)

That is why we accept that if w ∈ V (1) and u ∈ P then

vwu := κuAu · (w − u)

is the relative velocity of w with respect to u.

Then we have for u, u′ ∈ P

uA−1
κ′

u · vu′u = −κuA−1

u′ · vuu′

which implies, in general, that vuu′ 6= −vu′u.

Furthermore, we easily ﬁnd the velocity addition formula: if w ∈ V (1) and u, u′ ∈

vwu = vu′u +

Au · A−1

u′ · vwu′

u · vwu = vwu′ − vuu′.

4.3 Comparison of splittings.
Let us compare now the splittings in two diﬀerent reference frames u, u′ ∈ P which
κu u, we easily ﬁnd the vector

u (t, q) = A−1

u . Since s−1

u · q + t

is expressed by su′ · s−1
transformation law:

(12)

su′ · s−1

u (t, q) =

t, Au′ · A−1

u · q + vuu′

(t, q) ∈ I × E.

We call the reader’s attention to the fact that here vuu′ cannot be substituted with
u · (q − vu′ut) in the

−vu′u; if we want to use the latter quantity, we obtain Au′ · A−1
formula of the transformation law.

5. THE LORENTZ AETHER MODEL (LAM) [18,19].

5.1 Aether, dilation, contraction.
The previous type of spacetime model is very general (it contains the NRM as a
particular case: then P = V (1), Au is the identity of E and κu = 1 for all u). Now we
shall detail a special model (LAM) where
• there are an uo ∈ P and a 0 < c ∈ D

I such that

Regarding the previous deﬁnition, note that the symbol 1 denotes the identity map

of E and for n the linear map n ⊗ n acts as q 7→ n(n · q).

We ﬁnd that κuo = 1; furthermore if u = uo then the expression containing |vuuo| = 0
in the denominator is meaningless but it is multiplied by zero, so we mean that Auo = 1.

Of course, the set of luminal velocities is

5.2 Relative velocities.
The equality

is a trivial fact for w ∈ V (1); in general, if u ∈ P then

vwu = κuAu · (vwuo − vuuo).

vwuo = w − uo

Having the LAM, we can calculate quite easily all the quantities appearing in usual
applications of aether theory [18–26] without further assumptions and heuristic consid-
erations. For instance, we have for w ∈ V (1), u ∈ P

(20)

|vwu|2 = κ2

|vuuo |2 − 2vwuo · vuuo +

In particular, we have

|vu′u| = |vuu′ |

if and only if

|vu′uo | = |vuuo|.

|vuou| = κ2

u|vuuo|.

5.3 Ives-Tangherlini-Marinov coordinates [16,18,19,21,22,23].
If we choose a positively oriented basis (e0, e1, e2, e3) in M such that (e1, e2, e3) is
a positively oriented orthogonal basis in E, e0 is parallel to uo, e1 is parallel to −vuou
(which is not equal to vuuo!) then the transformation law given in 4.1 applied to u′ := uo
and expressed in coordinates relative to the chosen basis coincides with the well known
Ives-Tangherlini-Marinov transformation.

6. THE RELATIVISTIC STRUCTURE DUE TO THE AETHER.

6.1 The Lorentz form.
Due to the privileged observer (aether) in the LAM we can introduce a Lorentz form

on M by the use of uo-splitting:

(24)

x · y := (x − (τ · x)uo) · (y − (τ · y)uo) − c2(τ · x)(τ · y).

The Lorentz product denoted by a dot on the left hand side is an extension of the

Euclidean dot product appearing on the right hand side, so the notation is consistent.
The Lorentz form is arrow oriented in such a way that uo is pointing to the future.
So (M, D, ·) is a SRM associated to the LAM in which all the well known relativistic

notions can be used ([11], Part II).

6.2 Relativistic splitting.
For w, w′ ∈ V (1), we have

−w′ · w = c2 − vw′uo · vwuo.

In particular, −uo · w = c2 for all w ∈ V (1). Moreover, it follows that

ˆu ∈

(cid:26)

(cid:26)

u ∈ P

(cid:27)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

As a consequence, the inertial reference frames of the LAM coincide with the inertial
reference frames of the associated SRM. For the sake of brevity, we introduce the notation

We mention that ˆuo = − uo

c and

ˆu :=

κuu
c

(u ∈ P ).

τ · x = −

uo · x
c2

(x ∈ M).

The relativistic synchronization established by luminal phenomena depends on the
reference frame. The reference frame u ∈ P ﬁnds that luminally simultaneous spacetime
points are hyperplanes parallel to the three dimensional subspace

Eu := {x ∈| u · x = 0}.
10

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

Using this synchronization, the space of the reference frame u (the set of straight lines

parallel to u) becomes an aﬃne space over Eu by the subtraction

(30)

(q2 − q1)rel := x2 − x1

(x2 ∈ q2, x1 ∈ q1, u · (x2 − x1) = 0).

Thus u-space vectors are diﬀerent in the LAM and in the associated SRM. This
important fact disappears when considering coordinates, since coordinates of arbitrary
three dimensional vector spaces are triplets of numbers.

The set Iu of hyperplanes parallel to Eu constitute the time of the reference frame;

this is a one dimensional aﬃne space over I by the subtraction

(31)

t2 − t1 := −

· (x2 − x1)

(x2 ∈ t2, x1 ∈ t1).

ˆu
c

According to the relativistic synchronization, the observers in the reference frame u

split spacetime in time and space by

(32)

H ˆu : M → Iu × Eu,

x 7→ (x + Eu, x + u ⊗ I)

which is an aﬃne mapping over the linear map

(33)

hu : M → I × Eu,

x 7→

−ˆu · x

(cid:18)

, x + (ˆu · x)ˆu

As an important fact, we mention that the relativistic relative velocity of u′ ∈ P with

respect to u ∈ P is (see [11], § II.4.2.)

(34)

ˆu′

v ˆu′ ˆu := c

− ˆu · u′ − ˆu

(cid:19)

.

(cid:18)

6.3 Lorentz boosts.
The relativistic spaces of diﬀerent reference frames u and u′ are aﬃne spaces over the
diﬀerent vector spaces Eu and Eu′, respectively. However, there is a “canonical” linear
bijection between Eu and Eu′ which can be used to identify these diﬀerent vector spaces;
this linear bijection is the Lorentz boost from u to u′ (see § II.1.3.8 of [12])

(35)

L(u′, u) := 1 +

( ˆu′ + ˆu) ⊗ ( ˆu′ + ˆu)
1 − ˆu′ · ˆu

− 2 ˆu′ ⊗ ˆu

where 1 is the identity map of M.

11

This linear bijection preserves the Lorentz form and its arrow orientation as well as

the orientation of spacetime. Moreover, we have

L(u′, u) · ˆu = ˆu′
L(u′, u) · q = q if q ∈ Eu ∩ Eu′
L(u′, u) · v ˆu′ ˆu = −v ˆu ˆu′
L(u′, u)−1 = L(u, u′)

In usual treatments based on coordinates the space of every reference frame is considered
to consist of the elements of form (0, ξ1, ξ2, ξ3). This corresponds to the fact that one
chooses a reference frame (“rest frame”) and implicitly all the other reference frames
spaces are Lorentz boosted to the space of that reference frame.

6.4 Comparison of splittings.
If superluminal phenomena do exist then the Lorentz aether model oﬀers an adequate
structure for spacetime. Then we conceive that the relativistic formulae used in physics
refer to the SRM associated to the LAM. Therefore it is important to compare the
splitting su in LAM and the splitting hu in SRM due to a reference frame u ∈ P . Since
h−1

u (t, q) = q + ˆuct for t ∈ I, q ∈ Eu, we easily ﬁnd the comparison:

su · h−1

u (t, q) =

t +

(cid:18)

τ · q
κu

, q − (τ · q)u

.

However, this is rarely useful, because relates elements in Eu to elements in E = Euo.
To have a nicer formula, we map Eu onto Euo ”canonically”, i.e. we apply a Lorentz
boost from u to uo, and instead of the splitting hu we consider

huou :=

6.5 Comparison of motions in LAM and in SRM.
The history of a masspoint given by a world line function r : I 7→ M is perceived by an
observer in u as a motion; the motion is described in diﬀerent ways in LAM and in SRM.
To get a better comparison between the diﬀerent descriptions, we consider a vectorization
of spacetime by an origin o, i.e. the vectorized motion ru in LAM is obtained from

su(r(t) − o) = (t − to, r(t) − o + u(t − to))

where to := τ (o); thus by t := t − to we get

ru : I → E,

t 7→ r(to + t) − o + ut

The vectorized motion r ˆu in SRM (applying a boost to uo) is obtained from

(48)

huou(r(t) − o) =

· (r(t) − o), L(uo, u) · (r(t) − o) + ( ˆu · (r(t) − o)) ˆu

t as a function of tu, we get the vectorized motion in SRM:

(50)

r ˆu : I → E,

tu 7→ L(uo, u) · (r(t(tu)) − o) + ( ˆu · (r(t(tu) − o)) ˆu.

6.6 Propagation of superluminal waves.
The Lorentz invariance of the Maxwell equations means in our language that the
relativistic split form of the absolute Maxwell equations is the same for all observers.
Thus time, space and velocity in a solution of the split Maxwell equations concern the
relativistic splitting due to an observer u. Now we want to express the solution in
quantities corresponding to the aether splitting. Since the usual form of the solutions is
given in coordinates which means that all the quantities are automatically boosted to a
”basic” observer, uo in our notations, the result of the previous paragraph says us that
passing from the relativistic splitting (coordinates) to the aether splitting, space vectors
remain unchanged and the relativistic time t is to be substituted with t − vuuo
c2

· q.

Suppose now that we are given a solution of the Maxwell equations relative to the
observer u, and the solution describes a wave propagating with velocity v. The wave
propagation The wave propagation corresponds a uniform motion with velocity v in
SRM, thus we infer from the result at the end of the previous paragraph that the relative
velocity in LAM equals

(53)

.

The denominator must be positive, which means that for an observer u 6= uo not all

6.7 An application to rotating bodies.
There is a long dispute on whether the Lorentz aether theory or special relativity is
the adequate theory of spacetime. If superluminal phenomena will be detected then there
is no doubt. If not, the present mathematical model may help us to answer the question
ruling out loosely deﬁned notions and tacit assumptions regarding Lorentz aether theory
which can be found in most of the reasonings (e.g., in [24,25]) as it is pointed out in [19].
The experiments proposed in [24,25] refer to uniformly rotating rigid bodies. However,
as it turns out (see § II.6.7–6.8 of [12]), the relativistic theory does not admit an object
which would have all the well known usual properties of a nonrelativistic uniformly
rotating rigid body, so we must be very cautious in reasonings regarding them.

Let o be a spacetime point, Bo be a subset of E = Euo and Ωo : E → E an antisym-

metric linear map. Then the collection of world lines

(54)

{t 7→ o + κuut + Au · exp(tΩo) · qo | qo ∈ Bo}

gives a uniformly rotating rigid body in the space of the reference frame u according to
the LAM.

is
It seems, the ”uniformly rotating reference frame II” described in [12], § II.6.8.
the best candidate to be accepted as a uniformly rotating relativistic rigid body. This
describes an object which is seen uniformly rotating relative to u ∈ P . All its points are
given by a world line of the form

(55)

t 7→ r(t) := o + ˆut + exp(tΩ) · q

Eu
I and
where o is a given spacetime point, Ω is an antisymmetric linear map Eu →
q ∈ Eu is in the kernel of Ω, t is the (relativistic) time of the reference frame u passed
from the u-timepoint corresponding to o; lastly, the inequality ω|q| < c must be satisﬁed
where ω := |Ω|.

The u-splittings of t 7→ r(t) − o in SRM and in LAM give the corresponding motion

relative to u.

The relativistic motion (see § 6.5) is indeed a uniform rotation

(56)

t 7→ exp(tΩo) · qo

where Ωo := L(u, uo) · Ω · L(u, uo) and qo := L(u, uo) · q.

As concerns the motion in LAM, we have to ﬁnd the inverse of the function

(57)

vuuo
c2
By a convenient choice of the ”origin” o we can attain that vuuo be orthogonal to

t 7→ sq(t) := t +

· exp(tΩo) · qo

Ωo · qo; thus, since exp(tΩo) · qo = qo cos ωt + Ωo·qo

ω

sin ωt, we ﬁnd that

(58)

sq(t) = t +

· qo cos ωt.

vuuo
c2
15

If we denote the inverse of sq by s 7→ tq(s), then the motion relative to the reference

frame becomes, according to the LAM

(59)

s 7→ exp(tq(s)Ωo) · qo.

This is not a uniform rotation. Moreover, if we take a subset Bo of E in which qo can
vary, the corresponding world lines form a body which is rigid in the SRM but it is not
rigid in the LAM.

Thus in the usual considerations of uniformly rotating rigid bodies one should specify
from what point of view the body is rigid and uniformly rotating. This is important in
view of the rotor Doppler shift experiments, like the Kolen-Torr experiments [24,25]. See
a detailed discussion in [19,26].

We end this paper remarking that Santilli’s isominkowskian spacetime [27-32] provides
an alternative representation of causal events with arbitrary speeds and more particularly
that his isopoincar´e symmetry [28] provides the explicit form of the symmetry transfor-
mations valid for arbitrary causal speeds. The evidently expected connection between
our studies and Santilli’s isominkowskian spacetime will be studied at some later time.

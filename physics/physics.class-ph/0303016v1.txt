Abstract

We investigate the mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics of single Brownian macro-

molecules with inertia driven by external force dependent on velocity in isothermal ambient ﬂuid.

We ﬁnd the entropy production rate can be negative and argue that the second law of thermody-

namics is not violated. We propose a condition equivalent to equilibrium. We also ﬁnd the class of

the external force leading to equilibrium. Furthermore, we show that the local stability condition

of excess entropy is satisﬁed even far from equilibrium.

In modern physics and biology, stochastic dynamics has the various applications to macro-

molecular processes such as ionic channels, motor proteins [1] and biochemical reactions [2]

by nanotechnology. Such biological systems are mesoscopic and in nonequilibrium. The

mesoscopic systems have been studied not just as stochastic dynamics but also as thermo-

dynamics [3, 4, 5]. Recently, mesoscopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics of single macro-

molecules based on the Langevin dynamics has been rigorously developed in overdamped

regime [6, 7]. In this regime, the equivalence among detailed balance, time reversibility and

zero entropy production of the stationary solutions of stochastic diﬀerential equations has

been established rigorously [8]. However, when non-conservative external force especially

dependent on velocity is applied onto a single macromolecule [9, 10, 11], we need to consider

the inertial eﬀect to avoid Ito-Stratonovich dilemma [12]. In this paper we extend the meso-

scopic nonequilibrium thermodynamics of single macromolecules into inertial regime and

investigate the relationship among detailed balance, entropy production, and equilibrium.

We ﬁnd a novel feature of entropy production rate(EPR), which is shown to be composed

of positive entropy production rate(PEPR) and entropy pumping rate(EPuR). We ﬁnd EPR

can be negative due to EPuR term. It shows a possibility in nanoscale molecular cooling

mechanism. Furthermore, our approach might make possible the opposite direction of con-

ceptual development in nonequilibrium thermodynamics from microscopic to hydrodynamic

scale thermodynamics to the approach with internal degrees of freedom [5].

Following the general theory of polymer dynamics [13], the macromolecule itself, called

internal system, are described by a Hamiltonian H(x, y) = Σi

+ Uint(x) where x =

(x1, x2 · · · xN ) and y = (y1, y2 · · · yN ) and xi and yi are the 3-D coordinate- and momentum-

vectors of the i-th hard building block of the macromolecule. The random collisions between

solvent water molecules and the building blocks of the macromolecule are modeled by a

Wiener process since the building block is assumed to be much larger than water molecules

in heat bath and the time scales of the two can be separated [14, 15]. The corresponding

stochastic diﬀerential equation for the i-th building block of the macromolecule located in

phase space at (Xi,x, Xi,y, Xi,z, Yi,x, Yi,y, Yi,z) at time t is, with the Stratonovich’s prescription

and Einstein summation rule,

dXiα = ∇YiαH(X, Y )dt,
dYiα = {−∇XiαH(X, Y ) + ˜fiα(X, Y ) + giα(X, Y )}dt + Γjβ

iα (X, Y )dBjβ(t),

(1)

where ˜fi(X, Y ) is the α-component frictional force acting on the i-th building block by sur-

rounding water molecules, g(X, Y ) is an externally driven force dependent on the velocities

of the building blocks, dB(t) stands for the increment of Wiener process, dB(t)/dt is Gaus-

sian white noise, and dBi and dBj are independent when i 6= j. Γ tensor depends on Y when

frictional force is not linear in Y , as we shall show later. Eq.(1) is studied in terms of its

probability distribution P (x, y, t) using Kramer’s equation [16]. This equation is assumed to

have a unique stationary state [17] in our system. The corresponding Ito stochastic equation

producing the same Kramer’s equation is

dXiα = ∇YiαH(X, Y )dt,

dYiα = {−∇XiαH(X, Y ) + fiα(X, Y ) + giα(X, Y )}dt + Γjβ

iα (X, Y )dBjβ(t),

where

fiα(X, Y ) = ˜fiα(Y ) +

(∇Y jβ Γkγ

For the ease of calculation, we use the Ito stochastic equation Eq.(2) from now on.

Let’s ﬁnd the stochastic diﬀerential equation of local heat dissipation dQ(Xt, Yt)(≡ −(f +
ˆΓ · ξ) ◦ dX) [4] indicating how much heat is produced and dissipated from the macromolecule

located at (Xt, Yt) at time t to the surrounding water heat bath during time interval dt

for a stochastic process. ◦ indicates the inner product with the Stratonovich integration,
(ˆΓ · ξ)iα indicates Γjβ

iαξjβ, and ξ is Gaussian white noise. The stochastic change of internal

energy of the macromolecule dH(Xt, Yt) is the same as the work done on the macromolecule

by all the external forces including the collision with water molecules during time interval
dt i.e. dH(Xt, Yt) = (g + f + ˆΓ · ξ) ◦ dX. Using dW (≡ g ◦ dX) as the work done on the

macromolecule by external force g(Xt, Yt), dH(Xt, Yt) = dW (Xt, Yt) − dQ(Xt, Yt). Using

Eq.(2), we derive the stochastic diﬀerential equation for local heat dissipation

dQ(Xt, Yt) = dW − dH = g ◦ dXt − dH

= Hddt + Vt · ˆΓ · dBt + O(dBtdt),

where the integration with · will be done in Ito’s way and (Vt)iα(≡ (Yt)iα/mi) is the 3-D
velocity vector of the i-th building block and Vt · ˆΓ · dBt indicates (Vt)iαΓjβ

iα(dBt)jβ and

stochastic local heat dissipation rate Hd(Xt, Yt) is deﬁned as

Hd(Xt, Yt) ≡ −f · Vt −

T r(ˆΓˆΓT ˆM −1),

where ˆM jβ

iα ≡ miδij for any α, β. The expectation of heat dissipated upto time t for a

stochastic process, Q({Xs, Ys}; {0 ≤ s ≤ t}), is E[Q] =

small time interval (t, t + ∆t), the average amount of dissipated heat is E[Hd]∆t. Average

heat dissipation rate(hd) at time t can be deﬁned as

hd(t) ≡ E[Hd(Xt, Yt)] =

dxdyHd(x, y)P (x, y, t).

From Eq.(4) and (5), we ﬁnd that the frictional dissipation is related to ﬂuctuation i.e. ﬂuc-

tuation dissipation relation(FDR;hd(t = ∞) = 0) in equilibrium state with the generalized

Einstein relation proposed later and the extention of FDR into NESS even for far-from-

equilibrium state.

ﬂuctuation term,

We propose the generalized Einstein relation between non-linear frictional force in y and

ˆT = T ˆI =

ˆΞ(x, y)−1ˆΓ(x, y)ˆΓ(x, y)T ,

1
2

where we take kB = 1, ˆI is a unit tensor, T is the heat bath temperature, and ˆΞ is deﬁned

through the deﬁnition of frictional force

f (x, y) ≡ −ˆΞ(x, y) · v + T ∇y · ˆΞ

where ˆΞ satisﬁes ∇y · (∇y · ˆΞ) − (v · ∇y · ˆΞ)/T = 0. This generalized Einstein relation

is derived from Kramer’s equation with Boltzmannian stationary distribution and detailed

balance without the external force g(x, y). Note that only the limited form of frictional
force Eq.(7) and ﬂuctuation force lead the system to equilibrium and also note that ˆΓ(x, y)
depends on y when ˆΞ(x, y) is non-linear in y. How far away from equilibrium the generalized

Einstein relation is valid needs to be checked by molecular dynamic simulation.

In the range where the generalized Einstein relation is valid, we can ﬁnd the deﬁnite form

of EPR with Gibb’s entropy formula since we have the deﬁnite form of heat dissipation rate

Eq.(5). We shall ﬁnd the EPR is composed of two terms; one is always positive and the

other negative or positive depending on velocity-dependent external force g(x, y). Since the

above stochastic process is Markovian, we can introduce the entropy of the system using

Gibb’s entropy formula as −

P (x, y) ln P (x, y)dxdy [18]. Using the Kramer’s equation, the

time derivative of the entropy becomes, after several integrations by parts and assuming

decrease with y2,

where ep+ and epu are named positive entropy production rate(PEPR) and entropy pumping

rate(EPuR) and h is the entropy change due to heat dissipation. The generalized force
Π(x, y) is deﬁned as −ˆΞ · (v + T ∇y ln P ) where the ﬁrst term is related to frictional force
and the second is Onsager’s thermodynamic force. J(x, y) is deﬁned as ˆΞ−1ΠP . J(x, y) is
diﬀerent from probability ﬂow ˜J where ˜Jx ≡ vP and ˜Jy ≡ {−(∇xH − g) + Π}P which are
deﬁned from the Kramer’s equation ∂P/∂t + ∇y · ˜Jy + ∇x · ˜Jx = 0. We have neglected the

surface integral term of xy-phase space since the normal component of the probability ﬂow

to the surface of xy-phase space is zero and we have used that the normal component of

velocity to the x-space surface is zero since the macromolecule is conﬁned in heat bath.

PEPR is non-negative and indicates how diﬀerent the momentum distribution is from

Boltzmann distribution. EPuR has a meaning of how much the momentum space is con-

tracted by the external force g dependent on velocity. Since EPuR can be negative, entropy

production rate(PEPR+EPuR) can be negative. One of the concrete example is the case of a

3-D spherical Brownian particle with frictional force f = −Ξv under external force g = −αv

applied by the external source where α and Ξ are positive constants [11]. The stationary

distribution of this system is CExp[−(y2/2m + Uint)/Tef f ] where eﬀective temperature Tef f

[19] is

Ξ
α+Ξ T and C is a normalization constant. EPuR and PEPR can be calculated to
be −3α/m and 3α2/m(Ξ + α) from Eq.(9) and (10). Therefore EPR(=PEPR+EPuR) and

h(t = ∞) become −3Ξα/m(Ξ + α). In other words, heat ﬂows from water to the macro-

molecule! The average kinetic energy of the macromolecule is lower than the surrounding

water molecules since the external force act like frictional force on the macromolecule. The

external source applying the external force g and the macromolecule, as one whole system,

act like a refrigerator. The refrigerator takes heat away from water heat bath and dissipates

it outside of the external source while also dissipating the work done on the refrigerator i.e.

5

the work to run the external source selectively by detecting the velocity of the macromolecule

and making the force proportional to the velocity. The second law of thermodynamics is not

violated. Note that the external source applying g is a Maxwell demon having ﬁnite energy

storage, who takes away mechanical energy from the macromolecule and dissipates it away

outside of him while dissipating the work done to operate himself.

We propose that zero PEPR is equivalent to equilibrium with the assumptions that the

frictional force is odd in velocity and the external force is symmetric under time reversal.

The frictional force is proven later to be odd in velocity from detailed balance Eq.(19).

Let’s start its proof with the deﬁnition of equilibrium. We call a system is in equilibrium

when the system is in detailed balance and its stationary distribution is Boltzmannian(Pss =
Ce−(ΣN
i /2mi+Uint(x)+Uext(x))/T ) where Uext(x) is the external potential from g(x, y). From

i=1y2

Eq.(9), zero PEPR is equivalent to Π = 0 i.e.

∇y ln P = −

v
T

.

(12)

Therefore, we need to check that Eq.(12) satisﬁes Boltzmann distribution in steady state

and detailed balance.

First, let’s check the former. Eq.(12) is equivalent to that the distribution function

P (x, y) can be split into momentum- and position-dependent parts and the momentum-

dependent part is Gaussian with variance T mi i.e. P (x, y) = Px(x)Py(y) where Py(y) =

Exp{−ΣN

i=1y2

i /2T mi}. Plugging this distribution function into Kramer’s equation, we derive

−∇y · g +

· {g − ∇xUint − T ∇x ln Px} = 0.

(13)

v
T

Let’s get the possible form of g(x, y) as the solutions of Eq.(13). Eq.(13) is simpliﬁed as

∇y · [{g(x, y) − ∇x(Uint(x) + T ln Px(x))}Py(y)] = 0. The solutions are

g(x, y) = ∇x(Uint(x) + T ln Px(x)) +

(14)

A(x, y)
Py(y)

where A(x, y) is any solutions of ∇y · A(x, y) = 0. Since A(x, y) is odd in y, we can deﬁne
Uext(x) ≡ −Uint(x) − T ln Px(x) + C ′ where C ′ is a constant. Therefore, the probability
distribution function P (x, y) becomes CExp[−(ΣN

i /2mi + Uint(x) + Uext(x))/T ] where C

i=1y2

is the normalization constant. Note that the class of external force g(x, y), Eq.(14), leads the

system to Boltzmann distribution as a stationary solution and the class, of course, includes
conservative force(g(x, y) = −∇xUext(x)) and magnetic force(g(x, y) = ˆB · v where ˆB is an

antisymmetric constant tensor).

6

We also need to check Eq.(12) satisﬁes detailed balance. Let’s start from the deﬁnition of

time reversibility [8] which is equivalent to detailed balance in Markovian system. The sta-

tionary stochastic process is called to satisfy the time reversibility when the joint probability

distribution satisﬁes

P (~x(t1), ~x(t2), · · · , ~x(tm)) = P (ǫ~x(−t1), ǫ~x(−t2), · · · , ǫ~x(−tm)),

(15)

where ǫ is 1 for position vectors and −1 for momentum vectors [8, 12] and ~x is (x, y).

When the system is Markovian, using time translational symmetry in the joint probability

distribution function, the detailed balance [12]

P (~x, t|~x′, t0)P (~x′, t0) = P (ǫ~x′, t|ǫ~x, t0)P (ǫ~x, t0)

(16)

is derived. From Eq.(16), the linear operator of Fokker-Planck equation, L, is proven to

satisfy

Pss(~x)

Z

Pss(~x)

Z

f (ǫ~x)Lg(~x)d~x =

g(ǫ~x)Lf (~x)d~x

(17)

for all f and g where d~x = dxdy where we have used Pss(~x) = Pss(ǫ~x) from the integration

of Eq.(16) over ~x. From Eq.(17), after a simple calculus, we derive a set of conditions well

known as a potential condition [20]

∇y ln Pss(~x) = (ˆΓˆΓT )−1 · {−g(ǫ~x) − f (ǫ~x) + g(~x) + f (~x) − ∇y · (ˆΓˆΓT )}
ˆΓ(~x)ˆΓT (~x) = ˆΓ(ǫ~x)ˆΓT (ǫ~x).

(18)

(19)

It is also easy to prove that the time reversibility Eq.(15), detailed balance Eq.(16), Eq.(17),

and potential condition Eq.(18)(19) are all equivalent with one another in Markovian system.

We ﬁnd that frictional force is odd in y from Eq.(6) and (19). If the external force g is

assumed to be symmetric under time reversal even though A(x, y) is odd in y, such as the

magnetic force is also assumed to be symmetric under time reversal even though it is odd

in y, then the Eq.(18) becomes Eq.(12). Therefore we proved that zero PEPR is equivalent

to equilibrium if the external force g is assumed to be symmetric under time reversal and

frictional force is odd in y.

However detailed balance i.e. potential condition itself is just a necessary condition for

equilibrium in underdamped system since it does not conﬁne the class of the external force

leading to equilibrium. For example, when the Brownian particle is under the external force

7

g(y) = −αv and frictional force f (x, y) = −Ξv where α and Ξ are positive constants [11],

the system is time reversible since the stationary distribution function satisﬁes the potential

conditions. Time reversibility is a statistical property rather than a thermodynamic property

so the external force g can be treated as an additional frictional force and temperature can be

deﬁned as eﬀective temperature Tef f . Note that detailed balance is equivalent to equilibrium

in overdamped system [8].

Zero PEPR itself is also only a necessary condition for equilibrium since one of the

potential condition Eq.(19) can be violated even though it is a suﬃcient condition for Boltz-

mannian stationary distribution.

Finally, we prove that the stationary state of underdamped system is always stable under

any small perturbations δP with respect to Pss whether the generalized Einstein relation is

valid or not [7] since the stationary state satisﬁes the stability conditions for excess entropy

Minimum EPR at near-equilibrium state is also satisﬁed as Prigogine had proposed [21]

R

since δ2(ep+ + epu) = δ2ep+ ≥ 0 and δ(ep+ + epu) = 0 at equilibrium.

In conclusion, (1)we found the class of external force g(x, y) leading the system to Boltz-

mann distribution using the generalized Einstein relation Eq.(6). (2)We showed that total

EPR can be negative with velocity dependent external force g(x, y) because EPuR can be

negative. (3)We proved that zero PEPR is equivalent to equilibrium condition with the as-

sumption that frictional force is odd in velocity and the external force g(x, y) is symmetric

under time reversal. (4)We showed the stability condition for excess entropy at stationary

state near and far from equilibrium are satisﬁed.

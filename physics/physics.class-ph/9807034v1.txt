A computational study of sliding blocks on inclined surfaces is presented. Assuming that
the friction coeﬃcient µ is a function of position, the probability P (λ) for the block
to slide down over a length λ is numerically calculated. Our results are consistent with
recent experimental data suggesting a power-law distribution of events over a wide range
of displacements when the chute angle is close to the critical one, and suggest that the
variation of µ along the surface is responsible for this.

1. Introduction

The dynamics of rigid bodies sliding on inclined planes under the action of
gravity and possibly friction forces is a very old subject, present in most basic physics
courses. However these systems are still being studied in order to better understand
some of the intriguing properties of granular materials. Several recent papers1−5
present experimental and computational results that demonstrate the complexity of
friction-related phenomena in speciﬁc cases. A recent study 6 of cylinders sliding on
a rigid aluminum bar by Brito and Gomes shows that even this simple system may
present unusual features. Measuring the number N (λ) of slidings with length larger
than λ (see ﬁgure (1)) the authors ﬁnd broad regions that can be very well ﬁtted by
a power law N (λ)/N (0) ∼ λ−B, where the exponent B does not seem to depend on
the material or the inclination θ of the chute, when θ is close to the critical angle
θc = arctan µ. Their data are in agreement with the Gutenberger-Richter law7 for
the distribution of earthquakes and with numerical simulations by Chen, Bak and
Obukhov8 exhibiting self organized criticality. However, no theoretical explanation
of this behavior was advanced.

In this paper we present a simple model in order to explain the behavior observed
in the above mentioned experiments. We consider the problem of a block that slides
down, under the eﬀect of gravity and friction forces, on an inclined surface at an
angle θ with the horizontal. We assume that friction is due to the existence of many
uncorrelated contact points between the surfaces, and therefore becomes a rapidly

varying function µ(x) of the block position x on the chute. At t = 0 the block is set
in motion with velocity v0. If θ < θc, where θc = arctan µ is the “critical angle”,
the block will stop with probability one after some ﬁnite displacement λ. We have
in this case an ‘avalanche’ of size λ. Our aim is to obtain the probability P (λ) that
the block stops at position λ.

where θ is the inclination of the plane, x the block position along the plane, λ(= ∆x)
the total displacement and µ(x) the local friction coeﬃcient. Equations (1) and
(2) admit analytical treatment. The results of our theoretical approach will be
published elsewhere9.

2. The Computational Model

In order to simulate the position-dependent behavior of µ we introduce a very
simple computational model. This model is based on the following assumptions:
We assume that friction occurs due to randomly scattered contact points between
the two surfaces, and that these contact points are separated by a characteristic
length a. The displacement of the block is discretized in small steps of length a,
and we represent the “rugosity” of both surfaces by means of two binary strings of

0s and 1s. Each bit can be thought of as representing the average properties of the
surface over a length a. If for instance a certain region is more prominent than the
average, the corresponding bit is set to 1, and to 0 in the opposite case. Thus when
the two surfaces are put in contact, only those regions will contribute to friction
which both have a 1 on the corresponding location of their bit string.

We model the disorder by assigning random strings of bits to both the plane and
the block before each experiment. For computational convenience we set the block-
string length to be 32 bits. Typical plane lengths are on the other hand 105 bits.
The concentration of 1s on the plane- and block-string are Cp and Cb respectively.
In Fig. (2) we show a schematic diagram of a block of length 14 bits with
concentration Cb = 0.5 of ones, sliding over a plane with length L = 39 bits, with
Cp = 0.5.

The local coeﬃcient of friction µ(x) is deﬁned as

µ(x) = b

N (x)
Nmax

(3)

where N (x) is the number of coincident 1s and depends on both strings, Nmax is
the block length in bits and b is a constant that can be associated to the strength
of each individual contact.

The block motion can be eﬃciently simulated in the following way:

1. The block starts at x = 0 with total energy E0 = 1

0.

2. We let the block slide over a distance a corresponding to one bit, and its

energy variation is calculated as

3. If the total energy after this change turns out to be zero or negative, the block

has stopped. Otherwise we set E → E + ∆E and go to 2.

The critical angle θc can be obtained by setting < ∆E >= 0 in (4), and satisﬁes

tan θc = µ = bCpCb

Figure 3: The accumulated distribution N (λ) of slidings larger than λ for several
values of the inclination angle θ. Averages were done over 107 slidings. The critical
angle θc is π/4. The straight line N (λ) ∼ λ−1/2 shows the expected behavior for
θ = θc.

3. Results

We measure the number N (λ) of slidings with size larger than λ. We ﬁx Cp =
Cb = 0.5 and b = 4 so that θc = π/4. In Fig. (3) average results are shown for 107
slidings on a plane of maximum length 105 bits and several values of θ ≤ θc. The
straight line is shown for reference and corresponds to N (λ)/N (0) = λ−1/2. Our
numerical results indicate that, when θ is close to θc, the distribution of avalanches

shows a power-law behavior with exponent 1/2 over a wide range of sizes. This
exponent has the same value as obtained in experiments6. As expected on simple
grounds, below θc the distribution becomes exponentially decreasing for large sizes
and therefore there is a ﬁnite average size. As already mentioned, this problem
admits analytical treatment as well 9. In Fig. (3) we show a preliminary theoretical
result corresponding to (θc − θ) = 10−4.

The average sliding size λ was also measured, and the results are presented in
Fig. (4). A power-law λ ∼ (θc − θ)−ν is obtained with ν = 1.00 ± 0.02. This value
is consistent with ν = 1, which is obtained if µ does not depend on position. In this
case λ = v

4. Conclusions

A very simple model in which the coeﬃcient of friction changes from point to
point on the surface is able to reproduce a power-law behavior in the distribution of
slidings of a block on an inclined chute, as recently observed in experiments. This
holds for values of θ, the inclination angle, smaller than but very close to θc. In this
limit, the average sliding size diverges as (θc − θ)−1.

It is possible to do a theoretical study of this problem considering the random
variation of the coeﬃcient of friction. We show a preliminary result, and a complete
study will be published elsewhere 9.

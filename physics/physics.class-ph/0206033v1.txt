Abstract
A new thermodynamic analysis is presented for the intimate connections between blackbody
radiation and zero-point radiation within classical physics. First, we discuss the thermodynamics
of a classical harmonic oscillator. Using the behavior under an adiabatic change of frequency,
we show that the thermodynamic functions can all be derived from a single function of ω/T ,
analogous to Wien’s displacement theorem. The high- and low-frequency limits allow asymptotic
energy forms involving T alone or ω alone, corresponding to energy equipartition and zero-point
energy.
It is then suggested that the actual thermodynamic behavior for a harmonic oscillator
is given by the function satisfying the Wien displacement result which provides the smoothest
possible interpolation between scale-decoupled energy equipartition at low frequency and scale-
invariant zero-point energy at high frequency. This suggestion leads to the Planck spectrum with
zero-point energy. Second, we turn to radiation in a box in one space dimension. We consider a
box with conducting walls and a conducting partition so that the discrete normal mode structure
of the box becomes important. The contrasting Casimir energies are explored for the Rayleigh-
Jeans and zero-point spectra. The Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum involves no change of energy with
partition position, and the zero-point spectrum involves no change of entropy.
It is suggested
that the Planck spectrum with zero-point radiation satisﬁes a natural minimum principle which
corresponds to greatest independence of the system energy from the position of the partition for
a ﬁxed temperature. Numerical calculation shows that the familiar spectra other than the Planck
spectrum violate the minimum principle.
It is also remarked that in the absence of zero-point
radiation, there is no ﬁnite energy minimum solution and the familiar ”ultra-violet divergence”
reappears. Third, we review the previous derivations of the Planck radiation spectrum in classical
physics, all of which involve zero-point radiation. We again suggest, based upon scaling symmetry,
that only purely electromagnetic scattering systems will lead to thermal equilibrium involving ﬁnite
thermal radiation energy above the zero-point radiation spectrum.

INTRODUCTION

Discussions of blackbody radiation rarely make reference to zero-point radiation. Within
quantum physics textbooks, blackbody radiation is regarded as comprehensible only in terms
of quantum statistical mechanics, and quantum statistical mechanics has no role for zero-
point radiation. However, within classical physics, the two spectra are intimately related;
zero-point radiation provides the basis for understanding the blackbody spectrum. This has
been emphasized in the past, and in this article we describe a new aspect of this relation. It
is pointed out that the thermal radiation spectrum is the smoothest possible transition from
the scale-decoupled Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum at low frequency to the scale-invariant zero-
point radiation spectrum at high frequency. In this article we will provide a quantitative
meaning to this ”smoothest” criterion while providing a review of the connections between
blackbody radiation and zero-point radiation within purely classical physics.
OUTLINE OF THE PRESENTATION

Our presentation is divided into three basic parts. The ﬁrst part reviews the thermo-
dynamics of the classical harmonic oscillator and obtains the energy functional dependence
U(T, ω) = ωf (ω/T ) which is associated with the Wien displacement law. We note that
zero-point energy and energy equipartition represent the opposite extremes of this theorem,
one energy spectrum involving frequency alone and the other temperature alone. Next we
suggest that the actual thermodynamic behavior is given by the smoothest possible interpo-
lation between the equipartition asymptotic form at low frequency and the zero-point energy
asymptotic form at high frequency. Using this demand for a smooth interpolation, we give
a suggestive derivation of the Planck spectrum with zero-point radiation.

In the second part of this paper, we turn from a single oscillator over to thermal radiation.
Because of the greater ease of calculations, we carry out the analysis for waves in one spatial
dimension rather than three dimensions. We ﬁrst obtain the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the
energy density of thermal radiation in a very large one-dimensional box. Then we discuss
the thermodynamics of a one-dimensional system involving Casimir forces on a partition
which divides the box into two compartments, and we point out that any spectrum of
random classical radiation will lead to Casimir forces. Then we obtain the Casimir energies
associated with the zero-point spectrum and the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. The zero-point
radiation spectrum is special because it is the unique spectrum which involves no dependence
of the entropy upon the position of the Casimir partition; the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum is
special because it is the unique spectrum which involves no dependence of the energy upon
the position of the Casimir partition. From numerical calculations, it is easily seen that
thermodynamic principles applied to the Casimir thermodynamic system lead to restrictions
on the allowed thermal radiation spectra. We then explore a natural minimum principle for
the Casimir energies of various spectra. We ﬁnd the traditional ”ultra-violet catastrophe”
when classical zero-point energy is not included in the minimum principle. When zero-point
energy is included, then numerical calculation suggests that Planck’s spectrum satisﬁes the
minimum principle whereas other spectra do not. We conjecture that analytic solution of
the minimum principle would conﬁrm the Planck spectrum.

In the third part of this paper, we review the information in the literature regarding
blackbody radiation within classical physics, noting the variety of classical derivations of
the Planck spectrum, all of which depend upon the presence of zero-point radiation. Also,
we note the contradictory evidence regarding scattering by general classical mechanical sys-
tems. In this connection we again suggest that only purely electromagnetic systems have the
possibility of giving the Planck spectrum with zero-point radiation as the equilibrium radi-

ation spectrum. Finally we make some comments on classical theory within contemporary
physics.
PART I: THERMODYNAMICS OF A HARMONIC OSCILLATOR
DERIVATION OF FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCE CORRESPONDING TO
WIEN’S DISPLACEMENT THEOREM

As a beginning step in discussing thermal radiation, we consider the thermodynamics
of a classical harmonic oscillator system. We ﬁrst need to recognize the generalized force
associated with a change in the natural oscillator frequency. We consider a simple har-
monic oscillator system with natural frequency ω described by the Lagrangian L(q, ˙q) and
Hamiltonian H(q, p)

L(q, ˙q) = (1/2)m ˙q2 − (1/2)mω2q2,

H(q, p) = p2/(2m) + (1/2)mω2q2

(1)

This system can also be described in terms of action-angle variables ˜J, ˜w where

1/2

q =

2 ˜J
mω !

 

sin( ˜w),

p = (2m ˜Jω)1/2 cos( ˜w)

and the Hamiltonian is H( ˜J) = ˜Jω. [1] Now we are interested in the change of energy of
the oscillator under a very slow alteration of the oscillator’s natural frequency ω. During
such a slow alteration, the action variable ˜J is constant.[2] Thus the change of energy of the
oscillator is

and the work done by the oscillator on the agent altering ω is just the negative of this

dH = ˜Jdω = (H/ω)dω

dW = −(H/ω)dω.

(2)

(3)

(4)

Thus for an oscillator of energy U and (angular) frequency ω, we regard X = −U/ω as the
generalized force associated with a change in ω.

When the oscillator is at thermal equilibrium in a bath at temperature T , the oscillator
will have an (average) energy U(T, ω) and an entropy S(T, ω) depending upon the temper-
ature T and natural oscillation frequency ω. Using the work expression in(4), the laws of
thermodynamics for the oscillator give

dQ = T dS(T, ω) = dU(T, ω) − (U/ω)dω

information in the Wien displacement theorem.[3] Although the Wien theorem is often
derived from the adiabatic compression of waves in a cavity, our analysis shows that it holds
in thermal equilibrium for any system described by a simple harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian.
THERMODYNAMIC FUNCTIONS FOR A HARMONIC OSCILLATOR

The Wien displacement results S(T, ω) = g(ω/T ) and U(T, ω) = ωf (ω/T ) give con-
straints upon all the thermodynamic functions for a harmonic oscillator. The thermody-
namic potential[4] φ(ω/T ), from which all the other thermodynamics functions may be
derived, must be a function of the combination ω/T . The average oscillator energy U in
thermal equilibrium follows as

U(T, ω) = T 2

The entropy S of the oscillator is again a function of ω/T ,

S(ω/T ) = φ(ω/T ) + U(T, ω)/T = φ(ω/T ) − (ω/T )φ′(ω/T )

The Helmholtz free energy F is directly related to the thermodynamic potential φ(ω/T )

Thus the equilibrium thermodynamics of a classical harmonic oscillator system is determined

WIEN DISPLACEMENT RESULT AND ZERO-POINT ENERGY

(cid:18)

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

There are two natural extremes for the oscillator energy given by the Wien displacement
result in (13); one extreme makes the energy U(T, ω) independent of temperature T , and
the other makes the energy U(T, ω) independent of the natural frequency ω.

We deal ﬁrst with the temperature-independent energy. When the potential function
φ′(ω/T ) = const and so φ(ω/T ) = const(ω/T ), then the oscillator energy in (13) takes the
form

U(T, ω) = Uzp(ω) = const × ω

(18)

This corresponds to temperature-independent zero-point energy.

We note that substitution of the zero-point energy (18) into the ﬁrst law of thermody-

namics in the form

dQ = dU − (U/ω)dω = d(const × ω) − (const × ω/ω)dω = 0

(19)

tells us that no heat dQ enters the system on changing the natural frequency of the oscillator
ω. Thus changes in zero-point energy occur without any change in the thermodynamic
Indeed, we see that if φ′
zp is constant, then φzp(ω/T ) =
entropy S(ω/T ) of the system.
const × ω/T must be linear in its argument, and the entropy S in Eq.(14) vanishes for any
function φ which is linear in its argument.

Classical zero-point energy is random energy which is present even at zero temperature.
Classical thermodynamics allows the possibility of classical zero-point energy and experi-
mental evidence (such as that for van der Waals forces) requires its existence.[5] It is natural
to choose the unknown constant for the zero-point energy so as to ﬁt the experimentally
measured van de Waals forces. This corresponds to an oscillator energy

Uzp(ω) = (1/2)~ω

(20)

where ~ is a constant which takes the value familiar for Planck’s constant.
WIEN DISPLACEMENT RESULT AND ENERGY EQUIPARTITION

The other extreme for the Wien displacement result (13) is the case where the oscillator
energy depends upon the temperature but has no dependence upon the natural oscillator
frequency ω. Thus when φ′(ω/T ) = const/(ω/T ) in equation (13), then the oscillator energy
is

U(T, ω) = URJ (T ) = const × T.

(21)

5

This is the familiar energy equipartition law (proposed by Rayleigh and Jeans for low-
frequency radiation modes) where the constant is chosen as Boltzmann’s constant kB,

URJ (T ) = kBT.

In this case, an isothermal change of the natural oscillator frequency ω produces no change
in the oscillator internal energy. Rather, from (5), the isothermal work done on changing
the natural frequency ω is provided by heat added which keeps the internal oscillator energy
constant,

dQ = T dS(ω/T ) = dURJ (T ) − (U/ω)dω,

constant T

Then

and since we know the functional form S(ω/T ), we have the familiar result

dSRJ = 0 − (kB/ω)dω,

constant T,

SRJ (ω/T ) = −kB ln(ω/T ) + const

RJ (ω/T ) = −kB/(ω/T ), then φRJ (ω/T ) = − ln(ω/T ) and the entropy in (14)

Indeed if φ′
takes the form (25).
USE OF NATURAL UNITS IN THE ANALYSIS

In this paper we are not interested in the numerical evaluation of thermodynamic quan-
tities but rather in the fundamental connections between thermal energy and zero-point
energy. On this account we will measure all quantities in terms of energy and take the
entropy as a pure number. Thus we will take ~ = 1 and measure frequencies in energy
units. Also, we will take kB = 1 and measure temperature in energy units. Finally, we note
that we can choose to take the speed of light c = 1 and measure distances in inverse energy
units.[6] Thus the limiting form corresponding to zero-point energy has

φzp(ω/T ) = −(1/2)(ω/T ),

Uzp(ω) = (1/2)ω

while the limiting form corresponding to energy equipartition takes the form

φRJ (ω/T ) = − ln(ω/T ),

URJ (T ) = T

ASYMPTOTIC LIMITS FOR THERMAL OSCILLATOR ENERGY

In general, the energy of an oscillator system will depend upon both frequency ω and
temperature T as in (13). In the limit as T → 0, we expect to recover the zero-point energy
of the oscillator

limT →0U(T, ω) = limT →0[−ωφ′(ω/T )] = Uzp(ω) = (1/2)ω

and in the limit ω → 0, we expect to obtain the equipartition energy

limω→0U(T, ω) = limω→0[−ωφ′(ω/T )] = URJ (T ) = T

It is useful to make a distinction between the THERMAL energy UT (T, ω) of an oscillator
and the oscillator’s TOTAL energy U(T, ω). The thermal energy is just the (average) energy
above the (average) zero-point energy

UT (T, ω) = U(T, ω) − Uzp(ω) = −ωφ′(ω/T ) − (1/2)ω = −ω[φ′(ω/T ) − φ′

zp(ω/T )]

Although the total oscillator energy U(T, ω) is related to forces, it is only the thermal
oscillator energy UT (T, ω) which is related to changes in thermodynamic entropy since (as
seen above) φzp(ω/T ) does not give any thermodynamic entropy.
THERMAL OSCILLATOR ENERGY AS THE SMOOTHEST INTERPOLA-
TION BETWEEN THE EQUIPARTITION AND ZERO-POINT LIMITS

The two limiting forms (26) and (27) which make the average energy independent of one
of the two variables T or ω correspond to the expected limiting cases of high freqency-low
temperature ω/T >> 1 or low frequency-high temperature ω/T << 1 in (28) and (29). It is
clear that the actual thermodynamic functions for a classical harmonic oscillator should all
be smooth functions between these asymptotic forms. Prompted by our ideas that thermo-
dynamic functions represent the maximum of some quantity in the presence of constraints,
we suggest that ”the equilibrium thermodynamic behavior of a harmonic oscillator is given
by that function satisfying the Wien displacement results which provides the smoothest
possible interpolation between the asymptotic forms given by energy equipartition at low
frequency and zero-point energy at high frequency.” Let us explore this idea.

The limiting thermodynamic potentials

φRJ (ω/T ) = − ln(ω/T ),

φzp(ω/T ) = −(1/2)ω/T

(31)

involve a logarithmic behavior at the low-frequency limit. Since the logarithmic function
is more complicated analytically than the exponential function, it is convenient to take the
exponential of the negative of these functions and to consider

exp[−φRJ (ω/T )] = ω/T,

exp[−φzp(ω/T )] = exp[ω/(2T )]

(32)

The exponentiation will not change the ”smoothest possible” criterion required of the inter-
polation. Thus we are searching for the ”smoothest possible interpolation” between linear
behavior ω/T at small argument and exponential behavior exp[ω/(2T )] at large argument.
A familiar analytic function which joins exactly these asymptotic limits is the hyperbolic
sine function. Thus we write this smooth interpolation function as

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

It is easy to see that the right-hand side of (33) has exactly the asymptotic forms demanded
in (32). This smooth interpolation (33) then leads to the thermodynamic functions

zero-point energy. As noted above, the entropy depends upon the Planck thermal spectrum
but does not reﬂect the zero-point energy.

Thus demanding the smoothest interpolation between the equipartition and zero-point
limits suggests the Planck spectrum. Certainly, the hyperbolic sine function is smooth along
the real axis in the sense that it is an analytic function, and the function, together with all
its derivatives, is monotonic for positive argument. Also, the diﬀerences between the hy-
perbolic sine function (33) and both asymptotic forms in (32) are monotonic functions and
indeed all the derivatives of the diﬀerences are monotonic functions for positive argument.
Clearly a ”smooth” interpolation should lead to thermodynamic functions all of which are
monotonic (demanded by the thermodynamics) and which have monotonic diﬀerences with
the asymptotic limit functions. The Planck result with zero-point energy in Eq.(34) in-
deed leads to ”smooth” interpolations for all the thermodynamic functions. Because of the
monotonic behavior for the thermodynamic potential which includes higher derivatives, we
suggest that there is a natural sense in which the Planck result is the ”smoothest possible”
interpolation between the equipartition and zero-point energy limits. However, someone
more mathematically knowledgeable than the author must judge whether the ”smoothness”
criterion can easily be made numerical.
PART II: THERMODYNAMICS OF WAVES IN A BOX
USE OF ONE DIMENSIONAL WAVES FOR SIMPLICITY

Because we have not been able to give a numerical criterion for ”the smoothest possible
interpolation between the equipartition and zero-point asymptotic forms,” we will turn to
Casimir energies within the full radiation problem where such a criterion seems easily possi-
ble. Once again we will ﬁnd that thermal radiation is intimately connected with zero-point
radiation.

Although the calculations to be described below can be carried through for electromag-
netic waves in a three-dimensional box, we will consider a thermodynamic wave system in
one spatial dimension rather than in three because the mathematics is distinctly simpler
while the physical ideas are unchanged.[7] Thus we can imagine one-dimensional thermo-
dynamic systems consisting of beads on parallel frictionless wires which move between two
walls, or of waves on a string, or of electromagnetic waves which are required to move be-
tween two conducting walls with wave vectors k which are always perpendicular to the walls.
For electromagnetic waves in this case of one spatial dimension, the pressure p on the walls
would be related to the energy density E/V as

which holds for normally incident plane waves, rather than the three-dimensional situation
p = (1/3)E/V which holds for waves incident on a wall when averaged over all available
directions. If we multiply by the area of the walls, then Eq.(37) becomes

for our waves in one spatial dimension where X is the force on a bounding partition and u
is the energy per unit length. [8]
DERIVATION OF THE STEFAN-BOLTZMANN LAW

For waves in one spatial dimension, we can use the usual thermodynamic arguments to
obtain the corresponding Stefan-Boltzmann law for the thermal radiation energy which is
connected to thermodynamic entropy. Thus we assume that at thermal equilibrium the

thermal energy UT (T, L) and entropy S(T, L) of our waves in a very large one-dimensional
box of length L satisfy

UT (T, L) = LuT (T ),

S(T, L) = Ls(T )

so that, in this large-L limit, the thermal energy density uT and entropy density s are
functions of temperature only. Then the laws of thermodynamics give

T dS(T, L) = dUT (T, L) + XT dL

where we connect the thermal-related force XT to the thermal-related energy density uT ,
XT = uT as in (38). Then from (39) and (40),

Diﬀerentiating the ﬁrst equation in (42) with respect to temperature and substituting into
the second, we ﬁnd

with solution

where α is an unknown constant. This corresponds to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for this
one-spatial-dimension system. Also the entropy per unit length s follows from (42) and (44)
as

Had we used the 3-dimensional form p = (1/3)u and the same procedure with volume
V replacing the length L, we would have found the familiar expressions uT = αT 4 and
s = (4/3)αT 3.[9]
WAVE NORMAL MODES IN A ONE-DIMENSIONAL BOX

Systems satisfying the wave equation in a container with conducting walls can be de-
scribed in terms of normal modes of oscillation, each of which corresponds to a harmonic
oscillator system[10]

L(qλ, ˙qλ) = Σλ(1/2)( ˙q2

(46)

where the qλ are the amplitudes of the normal modes. For waves in one spatial dimension
inside a box of length L, the normal modes can be labeled by a single integer index n where
the associated frequency ωn is given by ωn = cnπ/L, n = 1, 2, 3..., where c is the speed of
the waves. For light, we can choose c = 1. Accordingly we can use the harmonic-oscillator
Wien-displacement result (12) or (13) for each normal mode to obtain the Stefan-Boltzmann

law for the thermal part of UT of the radiation energy. We consider only the thermal energy
UT since this is a ﬁnite quantity when summed over all normal modes, in contrast to the
total energy U or zero-point energy Uzp both of which diverge in the sum over (inﬁnitely
many) high-frequency modes. In a one-dimensional box which is so large that the discrete
sum over normal modes can be replaced by an integral, we have the total thermal energy

In the case of 3 spatial dimensions, the frequencies of the normal modes ωlmn would be labeled
by 3 integer indices and the same procedure would lead to a T 4 temperature dependence for
a large container.
THERMODYNAMICS OF CASIMIR FORCES

(cid:21)

The Stefan-Boltzmann law given in (44) and (47) connects the total thermal radiation
energy per unit length to the thermodynamic temperature T , and (through Eq.(38)) gives the
thermal forces for a large box. However, it provides no information regarding the spectrum
of thermal radiation. Now in obtaining Eq.(47), we took the limit of a large box L and so
replaced the sum over normal modes by an integral. However, by going to the continuum
limit, we lost the information which might be available in the discrete spectrum of the
normal modes. It was Casimir who saw the possibility of new forces and energies linked
to this discreteness of the classical normal mode structure. The most famous example of
such forces is the original Casimir calculation[11] of the force between conducting parallel
plates arising from electromagnetic zero-point radiation. Casimir worked speciﬁcally with
zero-point ﬁelds; however, the idea is not limited to zero-point radiation. Any spectrum of
random classical radiation will lead to Casimir energies associated with the discrete classical
normal mode structure of a container. Indeed, every thermodynamic variable will depend
upon the normal modes structure.

It should be emphasized how totally diﬀerent this classical wave situation is from the
classical particle situation of ideal gas particles in a box. Thus if a box with reﬂecting walls
is ﬁlled with ideal gas particles at temperature T , then the introduction of a thin reﬂecting
partition does not change the system energy and does not involved any average force on the
partition. In total contrast, the introduction of a conducting partition into a conducting-
walled box of thermal radiation leads to a change in the normal mode structure and hence
both to position-dependent energy changes (Casimir energies) and to average forces on the
partition (Casimir forces). These Casimir energies and forces will depend upon the precise
spectrum of random radiation and upon the precise location of the partition. In this article
we are proposing that the Planck spectrum for thermal radiation equilibrium arises from a
natural minimum principle for the Casimir energy changes associated with the placement of
a partition in a box of radiation.
CHANGE IN CASIMIR ENERGY DUE TO A PARTITION

We now consider a one-dimensional box of length L and calculate the change of radiation
energy ∆U(x, L, T ) with position x for a partition which is located a distance x from the

10

left-hand end of the box, 0 ≤ x ≤ L. The energy of each normal mode of frequency ωn is
given by U(T, ωn). The partition changes the normal mode frequencies and so produces a
position-dependent energy change ∆U(x, L, T ) which is a Casimir energy. We will calculate
the Casimir energy ∆U(x, L, T ) as the change in the system energy when the partition is
placed a distance x from the left-hand wall compared to when the partition is placed at
x = L/2 in the middle of the box,

∆U(x, L, T ) = {U(T, x) + U(T, L − x)} − {U(T, L/2) + U(T, L/2)}

We consider ﬁrst the two extreme cases for the thermodynamic potential φ(ω/T ) which
make the energy spectrum U (T, ω) independent of one of its two variables. The zero-
point spectrum (26) and the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum (27) both give divergent energies
when summed over the inﬁnite number of normal modes. However, this need not deter us
from calculating the Casimir energies associated with these spectra. The Casimir energies
∆Uzp(x, L) and ∆URJ (x, L, T ) are deﬁned as limits and are ﬁnite. In contrast to an ideal
system, any physical system (such as a string with clamped ends or else electromagnetic
ﬁelds in a region bounded by good conductors) will not enforce the normal mode structure
at very high frequencies (short wavelengths). Thus it is natural to introduce a smooth cut-oﬀ
exp(−Λω/c) related to frequency ω = ck

U(T, L, Λ) = Σ∞

(49)

Next we carry out the subtractions corresponding to (48) to obtain the Casimir energy,
∆U(x, L, T, Λ), and then allow the no-cut-oﬀ limit Λ → 0. Although here we will work
with an exponential cut-oﬀ because it is easy to sum the geometric series, the result is
very general; any smooth cut-oﬀ function dependent on frequency alone will give the same
result[12].

In this fashion, we obtain the Casimir energy for the zero-point radiation spectrum (26),

The Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum is the unique spectrum which produces no Casimir energy
changes associated with the placement of the Casimir partition, ∆URJ (x, L, T ) = 0.
AN EXTREMUM PRINCIPLE FOR THERMAL RADIATION

We note the striking diﬀerence in the Casimir energy for these two limiting cases. The
Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum gives ∆URJ (x, L, T ) = 0, corresponding to complete independence
of the Casimir energy from the location x of the partition. This is just like the ideal-gas
In
particle situation where the system energy is independent of the partition location.
contrast, the zero-point spectrum involves a smooth change in the Casimir energy as given
in Eq.(51) with a divergent change as the separation x from the wall decreases to zero; the
Casimir spectrum is special because it involves no entropy change with the location of the
partition.

Just as we suggested earlier that the thermodynamic behavior of a harmonic oscillator sys-
tem could be obtained as the smoothest possible transition from the equipartition limit to the
zero-point limit, here we suggest the same idea for the Casimir energies arising from thermal
radiation. We expect that the thermal radiation spectral function represents the smoothest
possible transition between the two extreme cases for Casimir energy changes calculated
above. Thus, for ﬁxed temperature T , we want to ﬁnd that spectrum U(T, ω) = −ωφ′(ω/T )
which is a monotonic interpolation between energy equipartition at temperature T at low

12

frequency and zero-point energy (1/2)ω at high frequency which makes the Casimir energy
∆U(x, L, T ) depart from zero by the least possible amount. In other words, the position of
the partition plays as little role as possible in changing the system energy. This assumption
arises from our sense that the thermal radiation spectrum should give the greatest possible
energy uniformity consistent with ﬁnite thermal energy. We recall that for ideal gas parti-
cles at thermal equilibrium, the system energy has no dependence at all on the partition’s
location.

We must turn this qualitative suggestion into a quantitative criterion. Since the Casimir
energy vanishes at the middle of the box, ∆U(L/2, L, T ) = 0, any departure of the Casimir
energy from zero represents a failure of uniformity. Speciﬁcally, at ﬁxed ﬁnite temperature
T , let us minimize the integral I of the absolute value of the Casimir energy integrated over
the length of the box

I =

dx |∆U(x, L, T )|

(53)

x=R/2

x=δ

Z

where δ is a small cut-oﬀ distance which is much less than any other length in the situation,
0 < δ << min(L, c/T ). The need for such a cut-oﬀ arises because of the divergence of the
zero-point Casimir energy at small distances.
CASIMIR ENERGIES FOR VARIOUS RADIATION SPECTRA

In one spatial dimension, it is quick to evaluate the Casimir energies for various monotonic
spectral functions U(T, ω) = ωf (ω/T ) on a home computer. One separates out the divergent
zero-point energy contribution corresponding to (51) and then evaluates the thermal contri-
bution to the Casimir energy for any assumed thermal spectrum UT (T, ω) = T g(ω/T ) where
∞
g(0) = 1, corresponding to the equipartition limit at low frequency, and also
0 dzg(z) < ∞,
corresponding to ﬁnite thermal radiation density in space. The total Casimir energy
∆U(x, L, T ) is the sum of the thermal and zero-point contributions.

R

We require that U(T, ω) be a monotonically increasing function of frequency as it goes
from the low frequency limit U(T, ω) = T to the high-frequency limit U(T, ω) = (1/2)ω.
This already puts restrictions on the monotonically decreasing functions g(ω/T ). However,
we ﬁnd that even monotonically decreasing functions g(ω/T ) which satisfy the limits g(0) =
∞
0 dzg(z) < ∞ as well as giving monotonic functions U(T, ω) = T g(ω/T ) + (1/2)ω
1 and
still do not necessarily lead to monotonic Casimir energy changes ∆U(x, L, T ) with partition
position x. Such functions are excluded by fundamental thermodynamics ideas. Neverthe-
less, for all spectra UT (T, ω) satisfying the two required limiting conditions, we can calculate
the test integral given in Eq.(53). The spectrum providing the smallest value for the integral
appears to be the Planck spectrum with zero-point radiation. Indeed, we may use the Planck
form (or other functional forms) in a variational calculation to obtain the parameters which
give the smallest value to the test integral for the given functional form. Thus the Planck
form for the thermal part of the radiation at frequency ω can be written as

R

We can introduce parameters C1 and C2 into a generalization of this form giving an energy
spectrum including zero-point energy as

UP T (T, ω) = UP (T, ω) −

ω =

+ (1/2)ω

13

(54)

(55)

For all positive parameters C1 and C2, this spectrum goes over to energy equipartition in
the limit ω → 0 and goes over to zero-point energy at high frequency while giving ﬁnite total
thermal radiation energy. Accordingly we can search for the the values of C1 and C2 which
make the test integral (53) a minimum. Numerical calculation shows that the minimum
value for the test integral is achieved when C1 = C2 = 1, corresponding to exactly the
Planck spectrum (35).

Indeed, of all the functional forms tested numerically, the Planck spectrum gave the
smallest value of the test integral. We conjecture that analytic calculation would show that
this spectrum provides the minimum for this integral, and hence in this sense provides the
smallest Casimir energies in the presence of zero-point radiation.[13]
’ULTRA-VIOLET CATASTROPHE’ WITHOUT ZERO-POINT RADIATION
We should also note that our minimum principle indeed requires the presence of zero-point
energy. If no zero-point energy were present, then we would still require that the thermal
spectrum give energy equipartition at low frequency and go to zero at high frequency so as
to give a ﬁnite energy density for thermal radiation. For this case, the thermal energy would
be the total energy in (53). However, there would be no natural high-frequency limit. If we
tried a smooth spectrum such as that suggested by Rayleigh URT (T, ω) = T exp[−C(ω/T )]
with an adjustable parameter C but without zero-point energy, then we would ﬁnd that the
test integral given in Eq.(53) decreases as the parameter C decreases, bringing the spectrum
ever closer to the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum, in which limit the integral vanishes I = 0 and
there are no Casimir energy changes. The absence of any natural cut-oﬀ frequency represents
behavior reminiscent of the ”ultraviolet catastrophe” emphasized by Einstein and named by
Ehrenfest in 1911. What prevents the catastrophic shift of thermal radiation to ever-higher
frequencies is precisely the presence of zero-point radiation.
ENTROPY CHANGES IN THE HIGH-TEMPERATURE LIMIT

For ﬁxed frequency ω and increasing temperature T , the Planck spectrum with zero-
point radiation goes over to the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. Similarly, for ﬁxed length x and
increasing temperature T the Casimir energy ∆UP zp(x, L, T ) for the Planck spectrum with
zero-point radiation goes over to the Rayleigh-Jeans result ∆URJ (x, L, T ) = 0. However, the
net force ∆XP zp(x, L, T ) and the net change in entropy ∆SP (x, L, T ) do not go to zero with
increasing temperature.
Indeed, these quantities go over to the values for the Rayleigh-
Jeans spectrum, which values do not vanish. Thus at high temperature, Casimir forces are
associated with changes in system entropy, not system energy.

The net force on the conducting partition in a box of radiation is calculated by summing
the forces due to the radiation in the normal modes on either side of the partition. Since the
total force on one side alone diverges with the inﬁnite number of normal modes, we introduce
a frequency-dependent cut-oﬀ, carry out the subtraction of the forces on the opposite sides,
and then take the no-cut-oﬀ limit. The force Xn associated with a change in box length L
and due to the nth mode is related to the force in (4) and (16) Xn = −Un/ωn associated
with a change in ωn by

Xn = Xn(dωn/dL)

(56)

Then we obtain the net ∆X force on a conducting partition in our one-dimensional
conducting-walled box as a sum over the contributions from the Xn on both sides. For
the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum, this is

We emphasize that the right-hand side of Eq.(61) is independent of temperature T . Thus due
to the normal mode structure of the box, there is a temperature-independent change of en-
tropy when the partition is moved. This seems reminiscent of the temperature-independent
change associated with mixing entropy for ideal gas particles. This same result (61) can be
obtained by summing the entropy over the normal modes of the box when using a cut-oﬀ
function, subtracting, and allowing the cut-oﬀ to disappear. This sort of entropy change
was noted recently in quantum ﬁeld theoretic analyses of Casimir forces in three-dimensional
situations involving electromagnetic radiation.[14]

The Casimir entropy change ∆SP (x, L, T ) = SP (T, x)+SP (T, L)−2SP (T, L/2) associated
with the Planck spectrum (and involving convergent sums) goes to the Rayleigh-Jeans limit
(61) at high temperature for ﬁxed values of x and L. However, for ﬁxed ﬁnite temperature
T , the entropy change ∆SP (x, L, T ) for the Planck spectrum goes to a ﬁnite temperature-
dependent limit as x goes to 0 or L.
PART III: REVIEW OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THERMAL AND
ZERO-POINT ENERGIES
CLASSICAL ZERO-POINT RADIATION

15

The discussion of the thermodynamics of blackbody radiation given here involves two
ideas which are usually absent from discussions of thermodynamics in classical physics:
i)classical zero-point radiation and ii)Casimir forces. Both these ideas have appeared in the
physics literature for some time but have not yet been accepted into textbooks of classical
physics.

Classical zero-point energy is random energy which is present even at zero temperature.
Classical thermodynamics allows the possibility of classical zero-point energy and experi-
mental evidence requires its existence. Thus classical electromagnetic theory derived from
Maxwell’s diﬀerential equations requires boundary conditions on these diﬀerential equations.
Although traditional classical electron theory[15] assumes vanishing electromagnetic ﬁelds
in the far past Ein → 0, Bin → 0, this boundary condition is in contradiction to Nature.
Experimental measurements of van der Waals forces[5] require the existence of classical
electromagnetic zero-point radiation with a Lorentz-invariant spectrum as the boundary
conditions on Maxwell’s equations. The unique Lorentz-invariant spectrum[16] of random
classical electromagnetic radiation corresponds to an energy Uzp(ω) = const × ω per normal
mode. In order to ﬁt the experiments, the constant must be chosen as half Planck’s constant,
const = ~/2.

Amongst physicists today, zero-point radiation is regarded as a ”quantum” phe-
nomenon.[17] Actually however, zero-point radiation needs have nothing to do with
”quanta,” with discontinuous in contrast to continuous energy changes. Classical zero-point
radiation is classical random radiation, just as thermal radiation was regarded as classical
random radiation in the years before 1900. When the appropriate classical boundary con-
ditions including zero-point radiation are applied, classical physics can describe far more of
Nature than is credited in the current physics textbooks[18].
PREVIOUS CLASSICAL DERIVATIONS OF THE PLANCK SPECTRUM

Derivations of the blackbody radiation spectrum within classical physics have taken many
diﬀerent forms, but all involve the presence of classical zero-point radiation. In contrast to
the one-dimensional thermodynamic analysis given here, all the previous work involves clas-
sical electromagnetic radiation in three spatial dimensions. The derivations include the
following. 1) The original Einstein-Hopf calculation for the average translational kinetic
energy of a point electric dipole oscillator in a box with thermal electromagnetic radiation
does not include zero-point radiation; when classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation
is included, the Einstein-Hopf analysis leads to the Planck spectrum with zero-point radia-
tion as the thermal radiation spectrum.[19] 2) The modiﬁcation of the Einstein ﬂuctuation
argument in the presence of classical zero-point radiation also gives the Planck spectrum
with zero-point radiation. Furthermore, we ﬁnd an understanding of photon-like ﬂuctu-
ations in terms of ﬂuctuations related to classical zero-point radiation.[20] 3) An analysis
of the diamagnetic behavior of a free particle in classical thermal radiation including zero-
point radiation leads to the Planck spectrum by comparison with a the behavior of a heavy
paramagnetic particle free to rotate in space at ﬁnite temperature.[21] 4) A classical point
electric dipole oscillator uniformly accelerated through classical electromagnetic zero-point
radiation behaves as though it were at rest in the Planck spectrum of thermal radiation
including zero-point radiation.[22] 5) A classical spinning point magnetic moment uniformly
accelerated through classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation also behaves as through
it were at rest in the Planck spectrum with zero-point radiation.[23]
CLASSICAL ELECTRON THEORY WITH CLASSICAL ELECTROMAG-
NETIC ZERO-POINT RADIATION

16

All of these results involving classical thermal radiation and classical zero-point radia-
tion point beyond the blackbody problem to the larger questions of atomic physics. They
suggest that one consider classical electron theory with classical electromagnetic zero-point
radiation, a theory which is often termed ”stochastic electrodynamics.”[24] Indeed, for point
electric dipole oscillators, such calculations have been presented repeatedly[25] with results
which show satisfying agreement with quantum oscillator systems. Furthermore, the corre-
spondence holds well for all point mechanical systems which have no harmonics. Thus the
inclusion of classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation in classical physics can provide
quantitative explanations of van der Waals forces, diamagnetism, and the speciﬁc heats of
solids as well as semiquantitative understanding of the absence of atomic collapse.[18]

Despite these signiﬁcant successes, many of those interested in classical analyses of
atomic phenomena have despaired of an eventual classical understanding. The confound-
ing analysis appears in attempts to understand thermal equilibrium in the presence of a
classical electromagnetic scatterer. All of the work to date,[26] including the heroic calcu-
lations of Blanco, Pesquera, and Santos,[27] suggests that the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum is
the unique spectrum of random radiation which is invariant under scattering by a classical
electromagnetic system which has harmonics. Such a conclusion dooms a classical point of
view.

Such a gloomy outlook may not be justiﬁed.

It is the author’s opinion that theoretical
physics continues to suﬀer from a blindness to the mismatch between mechanics and elec-
tromagnetism which was noted in the nineteenth century. The ideas of special relativity and
of relativistic mechanics arose at the beginning of the twentieth century from a recognition
of this mismatch. Quantum mechanics began at the same time as an ad hoc system to
accommodate this mismatch while still treating all mechanical systems as legitimate. The
inclusion of classical zero-point radiation as a boundary condition on Maxwell’s equations is
one of the ideas which is required in any attempt to understand Nature in terms of classical
theory. However, two other ideas are also surely needed. The ﬁrst is the restriction to
classical systems which share the scaling properties of electromagnetic theory. The second
is an understanding of ﬂuctuations at a level beyond the quasi-Markov approximation.
SCALING OF BLACKBODY RADIATION

Classical electromagnetic theory governed by Maxwell’s equations contains no intrinsic
length, time, or energy; the theory is scale invariant and indeed conformal invariant.[28]
However, the scales of length, time, and energy are all coupled together.[29] If the scale of
one of these is changed, then, the scales of the others must change. Thus the scales of length
and time are connected through the speed of light in vacuum c. The scales of energy and
length are coupled through Coulomb’s law for particles of unique charge e.

Nonrelativistic classical mechanics has no such connections between scales; rather the
scales of length, time, and energy can be chosen completely independently. Relativistic
classical mechanics moves toward the electromagnetic situation since it introduces a coupling
between the scales of length and time through the special velocity c which is the limiting
speed of a massive particle. However, within all of classical mechanics, energy still scales
completely separately from length and time.

The extremes of thermal radiation show the same contrast in energy coupling and de-
coupling as noted here. The spectrum of zero-point radiation Uzp(ω) = (1/2)~ω is invariant
under a scale transformation which couples length, time, and energy.[30] Such a transforma-
tion preserves the values of both the velocity of light in vacuum c and the constant factor
(~) which gives the scale of the zero-point spectrum. In contrast, the energy-equipartition

17

Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum URJ (T ) = kBT completely decouples the thermal energy scale from
the length and time scales. Thus it is perhaps not surprising that scattering calculations
relying on classical mechanical systems, which do not share the scaling properties of purely
electromagnetic systems, should produce only the scale-decoupled Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum.
SCATTERING BY PURELY ELECTROMAGNETIC SYSTEMS

Now back in 1989, when the scaling properties of blackbody radiation were analyzed, it
was suggested that only purely electromagnetic systems of charged particles were suitable
scatterers leading to equilibrium for classical thermal radiation.[29] Purely electromagnetic
systems allow conformal symmetry where only the point masses must be transformed. Fur-
thermore, the zero-point radiation spectrum is the unique spectrum of random classical
radiation which is conformal invariant.[30] It is noteworthy that to date none of the classi-
cal scattering calculations for radiation equilibrium has involved the Coulomb potential or
purely electromagnetic systems. Indeed, the previous calculations place constraints on the
allowed systems which speciﬁcally exclude these systems from consideration.[31] The black-
body spectrum of thermal radiation makes a smooth connection between the scale-coupled
and the scale-decoupled extremes, and one may suspect that only a purely electromagnetic
scattering system will show that the Planck spectrum with zero-point radiation is the equi-
librium spectrum of random classical radiation.[32]

Indeed, some unrelated classical electromagnetic work completed recently again reminds
us that purely electromagnetic systems can behave totally diﬀerently from general mechani-
cal systems. The interaction of a point charge and a magnetic moment is completely diﬀerent
when the magnetic moment is modeled as a charged particle in a Coulomb potential com-
pared to when the magnetic moment is modeled as a charged particle on a rigid ring.[33] It
is only the purely electromagnetic system which gives the foundation for understanding the
Aharonov-Bohm phase shift in terms of classical electromagnetic forces.[34]
CONCLUDING SUMMARY OF THE ANALYSIS

In this article, we explore the intimate connections between thermal radiation and zero-
point radiation within classical physics. First of all we review the thermodynamics of a
classical harmonic oscillator. Using the invariance of the entropy under adiabatic changes of
oscillator frequency, we ﬁnd the familiar result for the average oscillator energy U at (angular)
frequency ω and temperature T , U = ωf (ω/T ) where f is an arbitrary function. This
corresponds to Wien’ displacement theorem. However, all the derivations of this theorem in
the textbooks involve moving pistons in a cylindrical cavity rather than emphasizing that
this is a result holding for any system having a harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. We then
list the associated forms of all the thermodynamic functions for a harmonic oscillator system.
Next we discuss the high- and low-temperature limits which make the average oscillator
energy U independent of one of its two variables, ω or T . Thus we recognize the equipartition
result and the zero-point result as the two extremes allowed by thermodynamics. Since
zero-point radiation is present in nature, we assume that the equilibrium thermodynamic
behavior of a harmonic oscillator moves monotonically between U = kBT at low frequency
and U = (1/2)~ω high frequency.
It is the problem of classical theory to determine the
actual interpolation formula. It is suggested that the true thermal spectrum corresponds
to the smoothest possible interpolation between the scale-decoupled equipartition energy at
low frequency and the scale-invariant zero-point energy at high frequency. This suggestion
leads to the Planck spectrum with zero-point energy.

At this point we turn from the thermodynamics of a single oscillator over to the thermo-
dynamics of radiation. For the sake of simplicity, we consider waves in one space dimension.

18

We derive the Stefan-Boltzmann law applicable in the case of one space dimension, and we
note that it gives us no information about the radiation spectrum. Next we introduce a
movable conducting partition inside a box with conducting walls. The conducting boundary
condition gives rise to Casimir energies and Casimir forces associated with the changes in
the discrete spectrum of normal modes associated with the partition position. Every dif-
ferent spectrum of random radiation leads to diﬀerent Casimir forces and energies. The
zero-point spectrum is unique in that there is no entropy change as the partition is moved
within the conducting box. The equipartition Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum is unique in that the
energy of the box has no dependence on the location of the conducting partition. Once again
we suggest that Nature would choose the blackbody radiation spectrum as the ”smoothest
possible” interpolation between these extremes. We give a quantitative criterion for the
”smoothest possible interpolation” and report that of all the monotonic energy spectra we
have considered, the Planck spectrum is the smoothest. We conjecture that analytic cal-
culation would show that it is the smoothest of all possible spectra. We emphasize that
in the absence of classical zero-point radiation, our criterion collapses and the traditional
”ultraviolet catastrophe” ensues. It is precisely the presence of zero-point radiation which
prevents the shift of thermal radiation to ever higher frequencies.

There are several other aspects of Casimir forces which are noted. We ﬁnd that al-
though the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum involves no energy changes with the partition position
at ﬁxed temperature, it still involves Casimir forces on the partition and hence changes in the
Helmholtz free energy. The changes in the Helmholtz free energy are tied to temperature-
independent changes in the entropy associated with the placement of the partition. Such
temperature-independent entropy changes are reminiscent of mixing entropy in traditional
classical statistical mechanics.

Although the calculations presented here involve waves in one spatial dimension, the ideas

can be carried over to electromagnetic waves in three spatial dimensions.

Continuing our theme of the connections between blackbody radiation and thermal ra-
diation, we mention several derivations of Planck’s spectrum in the literature of classical
physics, all of which depend upon classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation.

Finally we discuss the failure of classical scattering calculations to give anything but the
Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum as an equilibrium spectrum. Working from the scaling properties
of thermal radiation and of electromagnetism, we suggest that only purely electromagnetic
systems have the appropriate scaling properties to give the Planck spectrum with zero-point
radiation as the equilibrium spectrum.
CLOSING STATEMENT

The blackbody radiation spectrum is a fundamental physical quantity which has been of
interest to physicists since the nineteenth century. The study of this spectrum was crucial in
the development of quantum mechanics. However, discussion of blackbody radiation is dis-
appearing from the text books.[35] Indeed, today many physicists regard quantum theory as
so ﬁrmly established that it can be taught from axioms without regard to the physical phe-
nomena which caused the historical development of the theory. Nevertheless, there are still
some physicists who believe that the foundations of modern physics, particularly in regard
to classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation, have never been adequately explored. At
the same time, today’s physicists are sometimes being asked to swallow bizarre new ”quan-
tum” explanations simply because physicists are unaware of the results of accurate classical
electromagnetic theory. The Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher phase shifts, on which
the author has worked in recent years, seem prime examples; the ”force-free quantum topo-

19

logical eﬀects” which are given as ”explanations” for these phenomena are accepted simply
because of physicists’ ignorance of accurate classical electromagnetic predictions.[34]

It is suggested that twentieth century classical physics suﬀered from three fundamental
failures. i)The failure to include classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation in the bound-
ary conditions on Maxwell’s equations. ii)The failure to restrict analysis to purely electro-
magnetic systems when dealing with fundamentally electromagnetic phenomena.
iii)The
failure to go beyond the quasi-Markoﬃan approximation when dealing with systems in ran-

failures will be rectiﬁed, and then we will indeed know the predictions of classical physics in
the atomic domain

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I wish to thank Professor Daniel C. Cole for his kind invitation to present a talk on his-
torical aspects of the Casimir model of the electron at the Seventh International Conference
on Squeezed States and Uncertainty Relations held at Boston University during June 2001.
The beginnings of this work arose out of communications with Professor Cole.

1980), p. 462. We are using the notation ˜J = J/(2π), ˜w = 2πw, where J and w are the
action-angle variables used in this text.

[2] See, for example, ref. 1, pp. 531-540. The situation involving adiabatic change in frequency
is most famous in the case of a pendulum length which is changed slowly. See, for example,
Goldstein’s exercise 10, p. 543.

[6] The choice ~ = 1 is familiar to particle physicists. The measurement of temperature in energy
units is familiar in thermodynamics where our choice corresponds to the use of what is usually
termed τ instead of T . See, for example, C. Kittel, Elementary Statistical Physics (Wiley,
New York 1958), p. 27.

[7] In this article we have discussed the case of waves in one spatial dimension. However, the same
thermodynamic analysis applies immediately in three dimensions. The behavior of Casimir
forces within a three-dimensional rectangular conducting box with a conducting partition can
be shown numerically to repeat the same sort of behavior as found in the one-dimensional case.
Indeed, related calculations were done decades ago in the three-dimensional calculations of

[11] H. B. G. Casimir, Proc. Kon. Ned. Akad. Wetenschap. 51, 793 (1948) gives the force per
unit area due to electromagnetic zero-point radiation. The Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum gives
a diﬀerent force per unit area, F/A = −ζ(3)kBT /(4πx3). See, for example, T. H. Boyer,
”Temperature dependence of Van der Waals forces in classical electrodynamics with classical
electromagnetic zero-point radiation,” Phys. Rev. A 11, 1650-1663 (1975).

[12] See for example, G. H. Hardy, Divergent Series (Oxford University Press, London, 1956).
[13] It is curious and perhaps signiﬁcant that the Euler-Maclaurin expansion which enters Casimir
calculations involves the same Bernoulli numbers as appear in the coeﬃcients of the hyper-
bolic tangent function. See, for example, R. P. Boas and C. Stutz, ”Estimating sums with
integrals,” Am. J. Phys. 39, 745 (1971) and M. Abramowitz and J. Stegun, eds., Handbook of
Mathematical Functions (Dover, New York, 1965), pp. 804 and 806.

the 2nd edition of 1915. Note 6, p. 240, gives Lorentz’s explicit assumption on the boundary
condition.

[16] The idea of classical zero-point radiation has occurred repeatedly. The earliest extensive sug-
gestion is given by W. Nernst, ” ¨Uber einen Versuch, von quantentheoretischen Betrachtungen
zur Annahme stetiger Energie ¨anderungen zur¨uckzukehren,” Verhandlungen der Deutschen
Physikalischen Geselschaft, 18, 83-116 (1916). Nernst was struck by the invariance of the
zero-point spectrum under adiabatic compression. The Lorentz invariance of the spectrum
was noted by T. W. Marshall, ”Statistical electrodynamics,” Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc. 61,
537-546 (1965), and later by others.

[17] Far too many foolish referees see Planck’s constant and conclude that quantum mechanics
is being used somehow. Indeed, there are no quanta whatsoever in the classical analysis of
the present paper. By the symbol ~, we actually mean [π2k4
B/(15c3a)]1/3 where c is the speed
of light, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, and a is Stefan’s energy-density constant, all constants
of classical physics. Stefan’s constant a was introduced into physics in 1879, long before any
suggestions of quanta.

magnetic zero-point radiation in The Quantum Dice: An Introduction to Stochastic Electro-
dynamics (Kluwer, Boston 1996). For a short review, see also T. H. Boyer, ”Random electro-

[31] See references 26 and 27. It seems noteworthy that the quasi-Markov limit required in the
available scattering calculations leads to singular behavior for electromagnetic systems.
[32] Note that classical electron theory ﬁts naturally into the curved spacetime of general relativ-
ity whereas most mechanical systems do not. This is related to the conformal symmetry of
Maxwell’s equations.

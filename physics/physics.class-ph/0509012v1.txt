The Lorentz transformation is derived without the postulate of the universal limiting speed, and
the general Edwards transformation is obtained by using the principle of permutation invariance
(covariance). It is shown that the existences of the one-way universal limiting speed (in the Lorentz
transformation) and the constancy of the two-way average speed of light (in the Edwards transfor-
mation) are the necessary consequences of the principle of permutation invariance that is consistent
with the postulate of relativity. The connection between the Edward transformation and the gen-
eral coordinate transformation is discussed, and based on this, we ﬁnd that the physical meaning
of the Edward parameter, which indicates the anisotropy of the speed of light, is a gravitomagnetic
potential of the spacetime.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In the textbook of classical mechanics, ﬁeld theory and
electrodynamics [1], the Lorentz transformation is de-
rived by using Einstein’s two postulates.
In fact, the
Lorentz transformation can also be obtained without the
second postulate, i.e., the existence of a universal lim-

words, the universal limiting speed can be derived from
the purely logical deduction (related to the principle of
relativity). Historically, such a viewpoint was suggested
by some authors [2, 3, 4, 5]. In this paper, a new way
based on the so-called principle of permutation invariance
(covariance) is proposed to conﬁrm our belief that a priori
assumption of a universal limiting speed is not necessary
in the derivation of spacetime coordinate transformations
(e.g., Lorentz and Edwards transformations [6]), and on
the contrary, the existence of the universal limiting speed
is a necessary consequence of the postulate of relativity.
Furthermore, by using the principle of permutation in-
variance, we generalize the Lorentz and Edwards trans-
formation to a more general form that agrees with the
postulate of relativity. We show how far such a general-
ization can go under the condition that the generalization
should fulﬁll the principle of relativity.

It is worth emphasizing that the one-way speed of light
is not an observable quantity, since when we measure the
one-way speed between two distant points, the time mea-
surement involves two clocks, which should have been
synchronized ﬁrst and then placed at these two points
[6]. However, this needs a priori assumption of a uni-
versal limiting speed (e.g., a ﬁnite, constant speed or an
inﬁnitely large velocity [7]). Someone may suggest that
we can make use of the means of synchronizing clocks by
slow transport, i.e., we ﬁrst set two clocks at one point
(say, A), and then carry one clock very slowly to another
point (say, B) [8]. But such a synchronization might
be aﬀected by carrying the clock from point A to point

B. If the eﬀect of the motion upon the translated clock
was known, then this method might be feasible [6]. This
means that the postulate of constancy of the one-way
speed of light lack the physical foundations [6]. How-
ever, the two-way average speed of a light from point
A travelling to point B and by reﬂection, back to A, is
an observable quantity since here only one clock is in-
volved, and the clock synchronization is not required. In
other words, the experiments (such as Michelson-Morley
experiment), which were said to verify the postulate of
constancy of the speed of light, actually demonstrates
that only the two-way speed of a light (in a closed path
of given length) is invariant, and the constancy of the
one-way speed of light has so far never been examined
in experiments [6]. The Edwards transformation, which
was suggested in 1963 based on the postulate of the con-
stancy of the average speed of light, is a generalization
of the Lorentz transformation.
In this transformation,
the speed of light in free vacuum is anisotropic, but the
average speed of light in a two-way (round-trip) process
is a constant number (independent of reference frames).
Although there has so far never been any experimental
evidences for the anisotropy of the speed of light, from
the point of view of physical logic, the Edwards transfor-
mation is a self-consistent coordinate transformation.

In the above, we pointed out that there exist no ab-
solute deﬁnitions of simultaneity.
In what follows, we
discuss in detail the possibility of the arbitrariness of
simultaneity within the framework of special relativity.
The relativity of simultaneity may be the most impor-
tant quintessence in special relativity. In the course of
teaching special relativity to undergraduates, the special
relativity is conveyed often by using Einstein’s deﬁnition
of simultaneity (usually called standard synchrony). But
this is not the unique existing example of relativity of si-
multaneity, because the principle of causality allows the
existence of other alternative deﬁnitions of simultaneity
[9, 10]. In an Einsteinian universe, no causal inﬂuence
can travel faster than the light in free vacuum. How-
ever, Reichenbach suggested that there is no reason to
rule out the possibility of arbitrarily fast causal inﬂu-
ences, which would then be able to single out a unique

∈

event at point A that would be simultaneous with the
event at point B, because the unique standard to deter-
mine the time sequence is such that all the consequences
follow the causations [9]. If a pulse travels from point A
at time t1 to point B and by ﬂection, back to point A at
time t3, then the time t2 when the pulse arrives at point
B (measured by the clock at point B) can be said to be
simultaneous with the time t1 + ǫ(t3
t1) (measured by
the clock at point A), where ǫ
[0, 1]. It can be veriﬁed
that as long as ǫ
[0, 1], such a t2 will not violate the
principle of causality [9]. In particular, Einstein’s deﬁ-
nition of simultaneity (standard synchrony) corresponds
only to a special case, where ǫ = 1/2. Here Einstein’s
standard synchrony is equivalent to the requirement that
the one-way speeds of the light be the same on the two
segments of its round-trip journey between points A and
B. Someone may argue that Einstein’s deﬁnition is the
only possible choice to deﬁne the relativity of simultane-
ity. In fact, within the framework of special relativistic
= 1/2), although
physics, other alternative choices (ǫ
perhaps less convenient, are indeed possible to give the
self-consistent deﬁnitions of simultaneity. The value of
ǫ depends upon the means of clock synchronization. If
we have a pulse signal with inﬁnite velocity, then we can
determine the value for ǫ. But in fact there might ex-
ist no such pulse signals, and it is therefore impossible
within the framework of special relativity for any syn-
chrony methods to result in ﬁxing any particular value
of ǫ to the exclusion of any other particular values [11].
In other words, the one-way speed of light cannot be de-
termined and is not an observable quantity. This means
that the deﬁnition of simultaneity is in a sense arbitrary,
and that Einstein’s simultaneity is only the most sim-
plest one among all the deﬁnitions of simultaneity based
on various means of clock synchronization [12]. Diﬀerent
means of clock synchronization can yield diﬀerent eﬀects
on the quantities such as the one-way velocity and the si-
multaneity, which are not directly observable. But they
will not aﬀect all the observable quantities such as the
two-way average speed of light.

As there are various possible means of clock synchro-
nization, and some alternative deﬁnitions of simultaneity
diﬀerent from Einstein’s standard synchrony will not vi-
olate the principle of causality, we can suggest a concept
of synchronization gauge to indicate the arbitrariness in
the deﬁnition of relativity of simultaneity. We show that
the essence of the synchronization gauge is just the gen-
eral coordinate transformation.
In the present paper,
we use the so-called principle of permutation invariance
(covariance), which is consistent with the postulate of
relativity, to derive the Lorentz and Edwards transfor-
mations. The postulate of the universal limiting speed is
no longer required in the derivation of the Lorentz trans-
formation. Instead, it is a theoretical consequence of the
principle of permutation invariance. In the derivation of
the Edwards transformation, the constancy of the two-
way average speed of light in a closed path can be derived
by using the permutation operation. The connection be-

tween the Edwards transformation and the general coor-
dinate transformation is considered with special emphasis
on the physical meaning of the Edwards parameter that
indicates the anisotropy of the one-way speed of light.
It will be shown that the Edwards spacetime is diﬀerent
from the Minkowski spacetime only by a global coordi-
nate transformation.

II. DERIVATION OF THE LORENTZ
TRANSFORMATION

A. Coordinate transformation without light

In the derivation of the Lorentz transformation, we
ﬁrst consider the motion of equation of an ordinary test
particle rather than of the photon, and then set zero for
the derivative of the transformation coeﬃcient with re-
spect to the particle velocity (the transformation coeﬃ-
cient should be independent of the motion of the test par-
ticle). Thus a preliminary form of the coordinate trans-
formation is achieved.

As in standard derivation of the Lorentz transforma-
tion, we consider two inertial reference frames (K and K′)
with spacetime coordinates (x, y, z, t) and (x′, y′, z′, t′),
respectively, and moving relative to each other with a
relative velocity v along ˆx-direction, the most simple lin-
ear coordinate transformation may be as follows

x′ = k(x
vt),
x = k(x′ + vt′).

−

(cid:26)

Here, for convenience, we consider the transformation of
the 1+1 dimensional spacetime only. We assume that a
test particle is moving in frame K with velocity u and
in primed frame K′ with velocity u′. The equations of
motion of this particle in frames K and K′ are therefore
x = ut and x′ = u′t′, respectively, provided that the
initial location at t = t′ = 0 in frames K and K′ are
coincident at the origins of K and K′. Substitution of
these two equations into Eq. (1) yields

Since the transformation coeﬃcient k is independent of
the velocities u and u′ of the test particle, one can have

It should be noted that the inverse transformation can
also be obtained by the permutation operation, which
will be discussed in detail when deriving the Edwards
transformation. Apparently, transformations (7) and (8)
are not explicit forms, where the λ parameter should be
determined.

B. Coordinate transformations among three
inertial frames of reference

In an attempt to determine the λ parameter involved
in Eqs. (7) and (8), we introduce a third reference frame,
and then discuss the completeness condition of the trans-
formations. The third reference frame is K′′ that is mov-
ing relative to frame K′ with a relative velocity ω in
the positive ˆx-direction. Thus there are three coordi-
nate transformations among these three inertial reference
frames K, K′ and K′′. In order to distinguish the λ pa-
rameters involved in the transformations, Eq. (7) (the
spacetime coordinate transformation from K to K′) can
be rewritten as

x′ =
t′ =

1
√1+λ1v (x
vt) ,
√1+λ1v (t + λ1x) .

Assume that the space and time coordinate of a point
in frame K′′ is (x′′, t′′). Then the second transformation
(from K′ to K′′) is given by

Since the terms on the left- and right-handed sides in
(15) are the parameters corresponding to their respective
transformations (9) and (10), they should be independent
of each other. Keep in mind that the two terms in (15)
are equal to each other. Thus they should be equal to a
constant number, say, q, i.e.,

λ1
v

=

λ2

and subsequently

λ1 = qv,

λ2 = qω.

(17)

where the ﬁrst formula is the law for the addition of ve-
locities, and the second formula can be rewritten as

Λ = qV.

(19)

Such a form is consistent with expression (17). Further
calculation can show that both of the two terms on the
left- and right-handed sides of Eq. (14) are equal to the
transformation coeﬃcient 1/√1 + ΛV in transformation
(12). This, therefore, means that the above formulation
is self-consistent.

Thus, according to Eqs. (5) and (7), the ultimate form
of the spacetime coordinate transformation from K to K′
is given by

t′ =

√1+qv2 (x

√1+qv2 (t + qvx),

(21)

It is apparently seen that if the parameter q = 0, then
Eqs. (20) and (21) are both reduced to the forms in New-
tonian mechanics. In other words, the Galilean transfor-
mation is the most simple coordinate form that fulﬁlls
the principle of relativity. However, the case of q
= 0
also satisﬁes the principle of relativity and is permitted
to exist in physics. In the subsection that follows, we dis-
cuss the physical meanings of the parameter q, and then
based on Eq. (20), show that the Galilean and Lorentz
transformations are the only two self-consistent coordi-
nate transformations.

C. The existence of an invariant velocity

It is clear that transformation (20) has a form anal-
ogous to the Lorentz transformation, if the parameter
q
= 0. One of the logical conclusions in the above formu-
lation is that there exists an invariant velocity in formula
(21) for the addition of velocities: speciﬁcally, if the in-
variant velocity is ξ (such an invariant velocity is a same
constant in both frames K and K′, i.e., u = ξ, u′ = ξ),
then from Eq. (21) we can have

and the following relation

can be derived. Thus the invariant velocity can be ex-
pressed in terms of the constant q, i.e.,

ξ =

Note that Eq. (26) has a same form as the Lorentz
transformation. Then what about the numerical value of
the invariant velocity ξ? It should be determined by the
experiments. Modern experiments show that the invari-
ant velocity ξ has the same value as the speed of light in
vacuum.

In the above we derive the Lorentz transformation
without the postulate of constancy of the speed of light.
In contrast, such a postulate can be viewed as a neces-
sary consequence of the derivation. Both the Galilean
and Lorentz transformations, which correspond to the
diﬀerent invariant velocities, can be derived in the above
formulation.

III. THE EDWARDS TRANSFORMATION AND
THE PRINCIPLE OF PERMUTATION
INVARIANCE

In the preceding section, we adopted Einstein’s deﬁni-
tion of simultaneity (standard synchrony) and assumed
that the one-way velocity is an observable quantity. How-
ever, as stated in Introduction, Einstein’s standard syn-
chrony is simply one of the various possible deﬁnitions of
simultaneity. In this section, we make use of the prin-
ciple of permutation invariance and establish the gener-
alized coordinate transformations, which correspond to
other deﬁnitions of relativity of simultaneity and agree
with the postulate of relativity as well as the principle of
causality.

A. Transformation coeﬃcients independent of the
velocities of the test particle

The principle of permutation invariance presented in
this paper is equivalent to the postulate of relativity:
speciﬁcally, the permutation operation can guarantee
that the physical phenomena in all inertial frames of ref-
erence occur in an identical manner. In what follows, we
show how the principle of permutation invariance works
in deriving the Edwards transformation. Assume that
frame K′ moves relative to K in the positive ˆx-direction
with velocity v, while K moves relative to K′ with veloc-
ity
v′. The space coordinate transformation between
frames K and K′ is

plicated solutions belong to the massive particles. If such
a massless particle is photon, then the physical meaning
of relation (45) is the constancy of the two-way speed
of a light: speciﬁcally, the average speed of a light pulse
travelling from point A to point B and by reﬂection, back
to A is an invariant quantity that is independent of the
choice of the inertial reference frames. Here c denotes the
two-way average speed of light in free vacuum. Clearly,
since X and X ′ are adjustable parameters relying upon
the means of clock synchronization, there is no absolute
simultaneity relations, and the standard Einsteinian syn-
chrony is simply the choice corresponding to the postu-
late that no causal inﬂuence can travel faster than the
speed of light in vacuum.
With the help of Eqs.

It can be readily veriﬁed that the parameter ς in expres-

means that the principle of permutation invariance pre-
sented in this paper is self-consistent. Thus, from Eqs.

The coordinate transformation (35) and its inverse
transformation (37) with the coeﬃcients k, k′ deﬁned as
(40) can be viewed as the generalized Edwards transfor-
mations. The Edwards transformation suggested in 1963
is in fact a simple one, the parameter σ of which is σ = 1.

C. The Edwards transformation

If the parameter σ is taken to be 1, then the transfor-
mation coeﬃcients k, k′ in Eqs. (35) and (37) are of the
form

k =

k′ =

IV. CONNECTION BETWEEN EDWARDS
TRANSFORMATION AND GENERAL
COORDINATE TRANSFORMATION

The Edwards transformation (50) can be reduced to
the Lorentz transformation if the Edwards parameters
X = X ′ = 0.
In the Edwards transformation, Ein-
stein’s postulate of constancy of the one-way speed of
light is replaced by the principle of constancy of the two-
way average speed of light.
In what follows we point
out the connection between the Edwards transforma-
tion and the general coordinate transformation. The
to-and-fro speeds of light in the Edwards spacetime are
c/(1 + X), respectively. It
c+ = c/(1

Although the tensor gµν seems to be a metric of curved
spacetime, it is actually a ﬂat metric since the Edwards
parameter X is constant for a certain reference frame,
and therefore all the components of the Riemannian cur-
vature tensor vanish, i.e., Rµναβ = 0. This means that
the spacetime with such a line element (55) is a ﬂat space-
time rather than a curved one, and that the symmetric
tensor (56) can be changed into a diagonal ﬂat metric
tensor by using a general coordinate transformation. It
is thus believed that the Edwards transformation is dif-
ferent from the Lorentz transformation only by a certain
general coordinate transformation. Note that such a gen-
eral coordinate transformation is a global (rather than
local) transformation. Therefore, the Edwards transfor-
mation is equivalent to the Lorentz transformation. The
special relativity with the constancy of the two-way av-
erage speed of light predicts the same observable eﬀects
as Einstein’s special relativity did.

For the Edwards spacetime, the physical meaning of
the Edwards parameter X in expression (56) is analogous
to a gravitational (gravitomagnetic) potential [13]. How-
ever, as such a gravitomagnetic potential is a constant
number, it does not lead to any force ﬁeld eﬀects for any
observable physical quantities. For example, in both the
Lorentz and Edwards transformations, the two-way aver-
age speed of light, which is an observable quantity, takes
the same value. But the values for the one-way speed
of light, which is not an observable quantity, are diﬀer-
ent in the Lorentz and Edwards transformations. Such
a diﬀerence is due to the so-called synchronization gauge
(i.e., the arbitrariness in the deﬁnition of relativity of
simultaneity).

As we have no ideal means of clock synchronization
(e.g., the inﬁnite-speed signals), there are no absolute
and unique deﬁnitions of simultaneity. Einstein’s simul-
taneity (standard synchrony) is simply a special case
among various possible deﬁnitions of simultaneity, which
obey the principle of causality. The Lorentz transforma-
tion corresponds to the one of the most simplest means
of clock synchronization, and the relativity of simultane-
ity in Einstein’s special relativity depends upon such a
special choice of synchronization. The measurement of
the quantities, which cannot be directly observable, has
a close relation to the deﬁnition of simultaneity (syn-
chronization gauge). Diﬀerent deﬁnitions of simultaneity
will give diﬀerent results of measurement for, e.g., the
one-way speed of light. But for any observable quan-
tities, diﬀerent deﬁnitions of simultaneity (and various
clock synchronizations) will lead to the same measure-
ment results.

The Edwards transformation was derived based on the
principle of permutation invariance (covariance), which
incarnates both the principle of relativity and the ar-
bitrariness in deﬁnition of simultaneity. As there is an
eﬀective gravitomagnetic potential (the Edward parame-
ter), the Edward spacetime can be considered a Rieman-
nian spacetime rather than a Minkowski spacetime. But
such a gravitomagnetic potential in the Edward space-
time is constant (independent of the spacetime coordi-
nates), so that there exists a global coordinate trans-
formation, which can transform the Edward spacetime
into the Minkowski spacetime. In this sense, the Edward
spacetime is equivalent to the Minkowski spacetime.

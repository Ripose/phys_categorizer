We sketch the foundations of classical electrodynamics, in particular the transition

that took place when Einstein, in 1915, succeeded to formulate general relativity. In

1916 Einstein demonstrated that, with a choice of suitable variables for the electro-

magnetic ﬁeld, it is possible to put Maxwell’s equation into a form that is covariant

under general coordinate transformations. This unfolded, by basic contributions of

Kottler, Cartan, van Dantzig, Schouten & Dorgelo, Toupin & Truesdell, and Post,

to what one may call premetric classical electrodynamics. This framework will be

described shortly. An analysis is given of the physical dimensions involved in elec-

trodynamics and subsequently the question of units addressed. It will be pointed

out that these results are untouched by the generalization of classical to quantum

electrodynamics (QED). We compare critically our results with those of L.B. Okun

which he had presented at a recent conference.

INTRODUCTION

2

When Maxwell, in the 1860s, formulated the ﬁeld equations of electrodynamics,1 he used

the ﬁelds E, H, D, B. Sometimes he would substitute B by µH. Subsequently, around 1900,

Lorentz in his electron theory reformulated Maxwell’s equations and eliminated (in a paper

of 1904, see [34]) E and B by putting, in vacuum, E = D and B = H.

This theory, often called Maxwell-Lorentz theory, had diﬃculties, like Maxwell’s original

version, in explaining the aberration of light, which had been discovered by Bradley in 1729.

Already Hertz, R¨ontgen, and others tried to formulate electrodynamics for moving matter.

The outcome of the Michelson-Morley experiment, which had been set up since Michelson

knew about the aberration problem, enforced a reformulation of the Maxwell-Lorentz equa-

tions, or rather their transformation behavior by extending the Galilean transformations of

classical mechanics.

Finally, Einstein in 1905 resolved the aberration problem, inter alia, in his paper “On

the electrodynamics of moving bodies.” Minkowski (1908) put this special relativity theory

(SR) in its ﬁnal form by introducing the concept of a ﬂat 4-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean

spacetime continuum, the Minkowski space(time).

This paper is dedicated to our colleague and friend Alberto A. Garc´ıa (CINVESTAV,

Mexico City) on the occasion of his 60th birthday.

II. POINCAR´E COVARIANT ELECTRODYNAMICS

The group of motion in Minkowski spacetime is the Poincar´e group (also known as in-

homogeneous Lorentz group) that is a semidirect product of the translation group and the

(homogeneous) Lorentz group. The Maxwell-Lorentz theory was then put in a Poincar´e

covariant form, see, for example, Einstein’s presentation in [11]:

∂φµν
∂xν

=

Jµ ,

∂φµν
∂xσ

+

∂φνσ
∂xµ

+

∂φσµ
∂xν

= 0 .

Einstein used a Euclidean metric with an imaginary time coordinate. For this reason all

indices are covariant ones.

1 For detailed historical accounts and for the corresponding references, see Darrigol [7] and Whittaker [62].

3

Later, in the 1930s and the 1940s, a quantized version of electrodynamics with the Dirac

electron as a source was developed on the basis of (1) and the Dirac equation. Quantum

electrodynamics (QED), as the newly emerging theory was called, is a theory in the frame-

work of SR and the Poincar´e group. The overwhelming success of QED made it look as if

(1) were the ﬁnal answer to an appropriate formulation of the ﬁeld equations of classical

electrodynamics.

However, such a view neglects the impact Einstein’s gravitational theory, the general

theory of relativity (GR), had on the understanding of the structure of Maxwell’s equations.

III. ELECTRODYNAMICS AFTER THE ADVENT OF GENERAL

RELATIVITY

Immediately after Einstein’s fundamental 1915 paper on GR and even before his big

survey paper on GR would appear, Einstein [9] observed that Maxwell’s equations can be

put in a general covariant form by picking suitable ﬁeld variables. This meant, unnoticed

even today, more than 80 years later, by most elementary particle physicists, the reanimation

of the D and the B of Maxwell (or, with Lorentz’s choice, of E and B).

Einstein [9] wrote Maxwell’s equations as2

In his “Meaning of Relativity” [11], in the part on GR — often overlooked by aﬁcionados of

the two Poincar´e covariant equations in (1) — he picked the letter φ for the ﬁeld strength

apparently in order to stress the diﬀerent nature of

On the foundations of GR, besides the equivalence principle, there lays the principle of

general covariance. And the Maxwell equations (3)1 and (3)2 are generally covariant and

metric independent. Since in GR the metric g is recognized as gravitational potential, it is

quite ﬁtting that the fundamental ﬁeld equations of electromagnetism do not contain the

gravitational potential.

summation symbols Σ.

2 Einstein used subscripts for denoting the coordinates x, i.e., xτ etc. Moreover, we dropped twice the

(5)

The gravitational potential only enters equation (3)3. We call this equation the spacetime

relation — it is the “constitutive law” of the vacuum. Needless to say that having understood

that there exists a way to formulate Maxwell’s equations in a generally covariant and metric-

independent manner, going back to (1) would appear — since 1916, in fact — to be an

anachronism.

The poor man’s way to adapt the Poincar´e covariant equations in (1) to the Riemannian

spacetime of GR is to substitute the partial derivatives ∂ by covariant ones

. Then, after

∇

some algebra, one also ends up at equations equivalent to (3). However, one wouldn’t under-

stand why the Maxwell equations are generally covariant at all. Moreover, the excitations

and

wouldn’t show up. Besides the ﬁeld strengths E and B, deﬁned via the Lorentz

and

, similar to E

H

and B, do have an own operational interpretation, see also [15, 16].

Following Feynman [12], we call F = (E, B) the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength and,

following Mie [39] and Sommerfeld [57], H = (

,

) the electromagnetic excitation.

In

H

D

exterior calculus, switching now to our conventions [17], see in this context also the new

books of Lindell [33] and Russer [53], the 4-dimensional Maxwell equations read

dH = J ,

dF = 0 ,

with the decompositions H = Hik dxi
∧
dxℓ/6, where dxi is a natural (or holonomic) coframe, a basis of the cotangent space. In

dxk/2, and J = Jikℓ dxi

tensor calculus we have

∂k ˇH ik = ˇJ i ,

∂[iFkℓ] = 0 ,

with ˇH ik = ǫikℓm Hℓm/2 and ˇJ i = ǫikℓm Jkℓm/6. Here ǫikℓm is the generally covariant Levi-

Civita symbol with values

1, 0. Of course, (4) and (5) are just alternative versions of (3)1,

(3)2.

On the surface of a neutron star, for example, where we might have strong magnetic

ﬁelds of some 1010 tesla and a huge curvature of spacetime — we are, after all, not too

far outside the Schwarzschild radius of the neutron star of some 3 km — the Maxwell

equations keep their form (4), (5), or (3)1 with (3)2, respectively. There is simply no place

for a Poincar´e covariant formulation of Maxwell’s equations `a la (1). A less extreme case

5

is the Global Positioning System. Nevertheless, also the GPS rules out Poincar´e covariant

electrodynamics, see Ashby [2].

The generally covariant and metric-free form of electrodynamics, together with setting up

an appropriate analysis of the physical dimensions involved in mechanics and electrodynam-

ics, has been worked out by Kottler [29], Cartan [4], van Dantzig [6], Schouten & Dorgelo

[54], Toupin & Truesdell [58], and Post [45]. Post’s book contains most of the relevant

information, see also Kovetz [30] and our book [17].

IV. PREMETRIC ELECTRODYNAMICS

We base electrodynamics on electric charge conservation (ﬁrst axiom), in diﬀerential form
dJ = 0 or, in tensor calculus, ∂i ˇJ i = 0. This law is metric-independent since it is based

on a counting procedure for elementary charges. Charge conservation is a law that is valid

in macro- as well as in micro-physics.3 The same is true for J = dH, a consequence of

dJ = 0 and the de Rham theorem. But this is already the inhomogeneous Maxwell equation

(4)1. The excitation H features as a potential of the current J, that is, the inhomogeneous

Maxwell equation is a consequence of charge conservation (and not the other way round, as

it is often argued in textbooks).

The axiom of charge conservation, a metric-independent law, explains why the inhomo-

geneous Maxwell equation dH = J is likewise metric-free. And, not to forget, the excitation

H is valid on the same level as the current J = (j, ρ). The excitation is as microscopic a

ﬁeld as is J (and E and B). Since charge conservation is valid at any level of resolution, the

same is true for the existence of the excitation H. To conceive the excitation H = (

D
as only a macroscopic ﬁeld, is simply neglecting the experimental underpinning of the law

H

)

,

of the conservation of electric charge.

We decompose the 4-dimensional excitation H into two pieces:

one along the 1-

dimensional proto-time σ and another one embedded in 3-dimensional space. We ﬁnd (see

[17]):

H =

−H ∧

dσ +

.

3 L¨ammerzahl et al. [31] are studying extensions of Maxwell’s equations that violate charge conservation.

Such models can be used as test theories for experiments on the checking of charge conservation.

i.e., we recover the Coulomb-Gauss and the Oersted-Amp`ere-Maxwell laws. The underline

denotes the 3-dimensional exterior derivative and the dot diﬀerentiation with respect to the

proto-time σ.

With charge conservation alone, we arrived at the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations (7).

Now we need some more input for deriving the homogeneous Maxwell equations. The force

on a charge density is encoded into the axiom of the Lorentz force density (second axiom)

fα = (eα⌋

J .

Here eα is an arbitrary (or anholonomic) frame or tetrad, a basis of the tangent space,

with α = 0, 1, 2, 3, and

can express (8) as ˇfi = Fik ˇJ k. The axiom (8) should be read as an operational procedure

force density fα, known from mechanics, and the current density J, known from charge

conservation. The 1+3 decomposition of F reads

F = E

dσ + B ,

∧

with the electric and the magnetic ﬁeld strengths E and B, respectively, see also Figure 1.

Magnetic ﬂux conservation is our third axiom. In its local form it reads dF = 0. This is

the homogeneous Maxwell equation (4)2. Split into 1+3, we ﬁnd

d E + ˙B = 0 ,

d B = 0 ,

i.e., Faraday’s induction law4 and the sourcelessness of B. The laws (10) are also metric-free

since at least in certain situations, namely in superconductors of type II, magnetic ﬂux lines

can be counted.

All our considerations in this section are generally covariant and metric-free and

connection-free. They are valid in ﬂat Minkowskian and in curved Riemannian space-

time, that is, in SR and in GR. Even if spacetime carried torsion and/or nonmetricity, see

4 The Lenz rule and the reason for the relative sign diﬀerence between the time derivatives in (7)2 and (10)1

are discussed in [22].

four diﬀerent geometrical objects that are deﬁned by means of the group of general coordinate

transformations. The images of 1-forms are represented by two neighboring planes. The nearer

the planes, the stronger the 1-form is. The 2-forms are pictured as ﬂux tubes. The thinner the

tubes, the stronger the ﬂow. The diﬀerence between a twisted and an untwisted form accounts for

the two diﬀerent types of 1- and 2-forms, respectively.

[21, 47, 48, 52, 56], there would be no need to reformulate Maxwell’s equations. Therefore

Maxwell’s equations in the form of (4), of (5) or of (7,10) represent the optimal formulation

of the fundamental laws of classical electrodynamics. Before we turn to the relation between

H and F , we will have a look at dimensional analysis.

V. DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS AND THE GENERALLY COVARIANT 4D

SCALARS OF CHARGE AND ACTION

A physical quantity is qualitatively characterized by a certain dimension, as, e.g., by

the dimension of length, mass, action, momentum, or electric charge. The dimension is

a reminder of the measuring procedure for this quantity. Length can be measured by a

8

micrometer, momentum by a collision process, an electric current by an ammeter, etc. Ac-

cordingly, the dimension of a quantity may be understood as shorthand notation symbolizing

the measurement procedure for this quantity. This, in our opinion, down-to-earth approach

may be contrasted with Veneziano’s view [8] who wrote: “...

it looks unnecessary (and

even “silly” according to the present understanding of physical phenomena) to introduce a

separate unit for temperature, for electric current and resistance, etc...”

A certain domain of physics has a small number of base dimensions and other dimensions

derived therefrom as products or quotients with powers in terms of the base dimensions.

Acceleration, e.g., can be expressed as ℓ/t2, where “dimension of length” is abbreviated as

ℓ and “dimension of time” as t.

In mechanics we have three base dimensions, length ℓ,

time t, and action h. Usually, instead of the action, the mass is taken as a base dimension.

However, from a principal point of view (in nature, there exists a universal constant with the

dimension of an action) and from a practical point of view (an action can be more precisely

measured than a mass), the dimension of action h as base dimension is to be preferred. We

follow here the dimensional analysis of Schouten and Dorgelo, see [54], and, in particular, of

Post [45]. In electrodynamics, besides the base dimensions of mechanics, namely ℓ, t, and

h, we introduce the base dimension of charge q, see Sommerfeld [57]:

base dimensions

(ℓ, t, h, q) .

→

(11)

Action and charge are (4-dimensional) scalars in spacetime. Thus the (anholonomic) com-

ponents of the electric ﬁeld, for example, have the dimension [Ea] = h/(q t ℓ), see [17].

Vectors, forms, and other physical quantities with more than one component require

special consideration. Already the electric ﬁeld, just discussed, is such a case. We will

come back to it. Because here we are mainly interested in electrodynamics, we concentrate

on diﬀerential forms.

In the framework of exterior calculus, the notions of absolute and

relative dimensions [54], which we are going to introduce, become almost trivial. Whenever

we have a p-form ψ, we may take an arbitrary p-dimensional submanifold S of spacetime

and calculate the integral

S ψ. This is a quantity that does not depend on the choice of
R

the local coordinates nor of the frames. The dimension of that quantity [

S ψ] is called the
absolute dimension of ψ. The relative (or physical) dimension is the dimension [ψα1α2...αp] of
its components with respect to a coframe ϑα. Here [ϑ0] = t , [ϑa] = ℓ, with a = 1, 2, 3.

R

Each physical quantity Q consists of its magnitude

and its dimension [Q] such that

Q
}

{

9

Q =

[Q], see also Massey [38], Sedov [55], Sec.7.7, and Wallot [60]. An equation

{

} ×

that is built up from physical quantities — this is particularly valid for a law of nature

— is called a quantity equation.

Its left-hand-side is represented by a magnitude and a

dimension; the same is true for its right-hand-side. Such an equation is required to be

dimensionally consistent. We would like to stress that these dimensional considerations are

valid independent of the units that we may eventually want to choose. Physicist who are

comfortable with “physical” equations consisting only of sheer numbers, have to arrange

beforehand a table in which all quantities are enlisted and the allowed units speciﬁed in

terms of which the numbers are to be determined. This is a possibility, but it tends to hide

the dimensions of the quantities involved and the “number equations” becomes opaque and

unilluminating from a dimensional point of view. Quantity equations are valid for arbitrarily

chosen units and no prearrangements are necessary.

Let us come back to premetric electrodynamics. To begin with, we consider the electric

current 3-form J. Its integral over an arbitrary 3-dimensional domain describes the total

charge contained therein. It can be determined by counting the particles carrying an ele-

mentary charge. The latter can be taken as a unit of charge, in the sense of the theory of

dimensions.

Thus, the absolute dimension of J is that of a charge:

[J] = q. Since the exterior

derivative is dimensionless, [d] = 1, and since the electromagnetic excitation is given by

the inhomogeneous Maxwell equation dH = J, we conclude that the absolute dimension of

the excitation [H] = q. Then, by means of (6), the absolute dimensions of the electric and

magnetic excitations turn out to be [

] = q and [
H
Ha] = q/(t ℓ) and [
a, b, = 1, 2, 3. These are the “physical” dimensions known to physicists and engineers.

] = q/t. The relative dimensions are
Dab] = q/ℓ2, with the spatial indices

those of their frame components, [

D

Since we denoted the physical dimension of an action by h, equation (8) shows that

the absolute dimension of the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength 2-form F is [F ] = h/q = φ,

that is, action/charge or magnetic ﬂux φ, see [17]. Then by (9), the absolute dimensions

of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds E and B are [E] = φ/t and [B] = φ, respectively, and

the relative dimensions [Ea] = φ/(t ℓ) and [Bab] = φ/ℓ2. Again, these are the every-day

dimensions known to physicists and engineers alike, see Table 1. The (passive) quantities

related to force carry a magnetic ﬂux in their dimensions, the (active) ones related to charge

the dimension of charge. This is nontrivial information that is buried if one suppresses

dimensions.

The charge deﬁned by the integral

J is an invariant quantity under general coordinate

and frame transformations on the spacetime manifold. Similarly, the integral of the La-

R

grangian 4-form V of the (electromagnetic or matter) ﬁeld over a 4-dimensional domain

V

is an invariant quantity with the dimension of action h. Thus, the dimensions of charge

R

and action q, h are distinguished from other physical dimensions, such as mass, length, and

time. Accordingly, electric charge and action are 4D invariants or scalars. Consequently,5 a

premetric physical quantity with dimensions

qn1 hn2 = 4D scalar

(12)

is a very natural structure. Strictly, by our arguments n1 and n2 are not required to be

integers. However, examples for such dimensionful 4-scalars are

be consistent with the twisted nature of H and the untwisted one of F , since [F ] = [action/charge] = h/q.
Such a prescription could exclude noninteger numbers n1 and n2 in (12).

Here e denotes the elementary charge and h Planck’s constant. These two quantities are both

of type (12). The premetric nature of RK has helped us to predict [19] that the quantum

Hall eﬀect cannot couple to the gravitational ﬁeld.

So far, our dimensional analysis did not make use of the metric. Moreover, it is generally

covariant and as such valid in particular in GR and SR. And, on top of that, our consid-

erations do not depend on any particular choice of the system of physical units. Whatever

your favorite system of units may be, our results will apply to it. In short: Our dimensional

analysis so far is premetric, generally covariant, and valid for any system of units.

VI. VACUUM RESISTANCE Ω0 AND THE SPEED OF LIGHT c AS

PROPERTIES OF SPACETIME

The spacetime metric naturally enters electromagnetic theory in the constitutive relations

between the excitation and the ﬁeld strength, H = H(F ), see (3)3. A local and linear

spacetime relation is the natural ﬁrst choice:

This fact is of fundamental importance since it is independent of any choice of the local

(17)

6 Recently we developed a method for deriving the light cone from a number of requirements imposed on

the local and linear spacetime relation (15), see [18] and references given there.

The standard Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics arises when we assume additionally

isotropy relations between the (extensive, or additive) quantities

essential information about the electric and magnetic properties of spacetime. This is where

the latter reads gij = diag(c2,

with the help of the (4-dimensional) Hodge star ⋆ of the metric gij, as

H = λ0

⋆F .

We may consider this law as constitutive relation for spacetime itself, with the “moduli” c

and Ω0 (= 1/λ0).

The operator

in (18) has the dimension of a length ℓ or its reciprocal 1/ℓ, respectively.

respectively. They are also called vacuum permittivity and vacuum permeability, see the new

Codata report [41]. Dimensionwise, it is clearly visible that the two quantities introduced

in (19) are

[c] = ℓ/t

and

[Ω0] = φ/q = h/q2 .

(24)

Obviously, the velocity c and the resistance Ω0 are constants of nature, the velocity of light

c being a universal one, whereas Ω0, the characteristic impedance (or wave resistance) of the

vacuum, seemingly refers only to the electromagnetic properties of spacetime. Note that λ0

plays the role of the coupling constant of the electromagnetic ﬁeld which enters as a factor

The Maxwell equations (4), together with the Maxwell-Lorentz spacetime relation (22)

[or, in 1 + 3 form, (7) and (10), together with (18)], constitute the foundations of classical

electrodynamics:

d ⋆F = Ω0 J ,

dF = 0 .

These laws, in the classical domain, are assumed to be of universal validity. Only if vacuum

polarization eﬀects of quantum electrodynamics are taken care of or if hypothetical nonlocal

terms emerge due to huge accelerations, the spacetime relation H = H(F ) can pick up

corrections yielding a nonlinear law (Heisenberg-Euler electrodynamics [20]) or a nonlocal

law (Volterra-Mashhoon electrodynamics, see [36, 37, 42]), respectively, see also [17]. In this

sense, the Maxwell equations (4) are “more universal” than the Maxwell-Lorentz spacetime

relation (22). The latter is not completely untouchable.

Let us underline that everything derived in this section is independent of any choice of

the system of units. We are relying on general dimensional analysis alone.

VII. TIME DEPENDENCE OF FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANTS

The possibility of time and space variations of the fundamental constants is discussed in

the literature both from an experimental and a theoretical point of view, see [26, 27, 59], for

example. Of particular interest are certain indications that the ﬁne structure constant may

slowly change on a cosmological time scale. It is thus important to know whether this fact

can be related to a possible variation of the physical constants: h, e, c, or none of these?

14

Maxwell’s equations follow from charge and ﬂux conservation. Any charge is proportional

to the elementary charge e, any ﬂux is proportional to the elementary ﬂux h/e2. Conse-

quently, if e and h keep their values constant (independent of time, e.g.), then the quantities

proportional to them or any power of them, namely en1hn2, with n1 and n2 as integer num-

bers, are also conserved. Therefore the time independence of e and h are the raison d’etre

for the Maxwell equations. Or the other way round: If we want to uphold the Maxwell

equations, then we have to demand e = const and h = const.

As we already mentioned above, charge q and action h are 4D scalars. Thus no time

dependence is allowed provided the premetric Maxwell equations are assumed to be valid.

This, however, is not true for c, and that was the reason why Peres [44] related the experi-

mental evidence of the variability of the ﬁne structure “constant” to the change of the speed

of light c = c(t, xa).

However, there is a diﬀerent possibility. In order to realize this, let us have a closer look

at the deﬁnition of the ﬁne structure constant:

αf =

e2
2ε0 c h

=

e2
2 h λ0

=

Ω0
2RK

.

(27)

As we see, the ﬁne structure constant is explicitly given in terms of the ratio of two resistances

— vacuum impedance Ω0 and von Klitzing constant RK (the quantum Hall resistance). Note

that the speed of light c disappeared completely! Its “presence” in the ﬁrst equality is in fact

misleading and the proper understanding is suggested only in the second equality where λ0

shows up instead, together with e and h.

In other words, the formula (27) demonstrates that of the two fundamental constants of

electrodynamics, which appear naturally in the Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics (see the

previous section), it is the vacuum impedance which enters the ﬁne structure constant and

not the speed of light.

Recall now again the argument [44] that e and h, being 4D scalars, should not change in

time and space provided one wants to uphold the validity of the Maxwell equations (4). Then

the variation of the ﬁne structure constant αf = αf(t) forces us to conclude that λ0 = λ0(t).

An inspection of the Maxwell Lagrangian (25) then shows that λ0 becomes a dynamical

dilaton ﬁeld. Such models were studied by Bekenstein [3], although with a diﬀerent physical

interpretation (of a variable e). In the axiomatic pre-metric approach to electrodynamics,

we have two (pseudo)scalar parts of the spacetime relation, which are independent of the

15

spacetime metric: these are the dilaton and the axion. The variability of the ﬁne structure

constant thus may be explained by the presence of the dilaton ﬁeld in the Maxwell-Lorentz

spacetime relation.

VIII. CHOICE OF UNITS: HERE SI

We want to stress that the electromagnetic “moduli” of spacetime (of “vacuum”), namely

the speed of light c and the vacuum resistance Ω0, can be identiﬁed by a generally covari-

ant dimensional analysis, which is valid in GR and SR likewise. By the same token, the

electric and the magnetic constants ε0 and µ0, see (19), emerge in a consistent approach

to electrodynamics willy nilly and are, in particular, not attached to any speciﬁc system of

physical units. The absolute or relative dimensions of a physical quantity are inborn and

cannot be chosen freely. As long as physics remains an experimental science, the notion of

the dimension of a physical quantity will be with us.

In the end, however, we want to pick a convenient system of units. We will choose the

SI-system. It is well-known from the literature how one can go over to other system of units,

see, e.g., Massey [38], Post [45], or Sommerfeld [57]. The base dimensions of the SI-system

for mechanics and electrodynamics are (ℓ, M, t, q/t), with M as dimension of mass. The

units are meter, kilogram, second, and ampere, respectively (therefore originally called the

MKSA-system).

However, if we choose as base dimensions (11), we ﬁnd the following SI-units:

(ℓ, t, h, q)

(m, s, Wb

C, C) .

→

×

(28)

Thus,

instead of the base units kilogram and ampere, we choose joule

second (or

×

weber

coulomb) and coulomb. Accordingly, coulomb and weber, that is, electric charge

and magnetic ﬂux take center stage, as it should be in a domain of physics where charge

and ﬂux conservation are at its basis. Numerically, in the SI-system, one puts (for historical

×

reasons)

µ0 = 4π

10−7 Wb s
C m

×

(magnetic constant) .

(29)

Then measurements `a la Weber-Kohlrausch [61], see Sec.5.3.1 of [50], yield

ε0 = 8.854 188

(electric constant) .

IX. COMMENTS ON A RECENT PAPER OF OKUN [43]

First of all we should say that Okun, at least in the realm of elementary particle physics,

expresses the majority view as it is given, e.g., in the textbooks of Feynman [12], Jackson [23],

or Landau-Lifshitz [32], see also the discussions of Chambers [5] and Roche [51]. We believe,

however, see Secs.IV, V, and VI above and Ref.[17], that the premetric approach embodies

a number of decisive advantages that leads to a better understanding of the structure of

classical electrodynamics as compared to the conventional approach.

Our three main points against Okun’s Sec.10 on electrodynamics are the following:

A. General covariance and Maxwell’s equations

In Okun’s discussion on electrodynamics in his Sec.10, GR is never mentioned even though

the title of this section reads “Electromagnetism and Relativity.”7 Okun exclusively uses

SR for the discussion of Maxwell’s equations. This was appropriate in 1908.

It is true, as Okun mentions, that Maxwell related his ﬁelds E,

,

, B to the aether.

D

H

Already in 1920, Einstein [10] pointed out in his Leiden lecture that the gravitational po-

tential gij is some kind of new aether reminiscent of the old aether of the 19th century.

However, one must not attribute a velocity to the new aether at each point of spacetime. To

quote Einstein’s summary (our translation): “If we follow general relativity theory, space

is endowed with physical qualities; thus, in this sense, there exists an aether. According

to general relativity theory, space without aether is unthinkable; for in such a space there

would be not only no propagation of light but also no possibility for measuring rods and

clocks to exist, hence also no spatial and temporal intervals in the sense of physics. How-

ever, this aether must not be thought of being endowed with the characteristic properties of

ponderable matter, namely to consist of parts that can be tracked through time; the concept

of motion must not be applied to it.”

We take Einstein’s point of view. One should also note that Truesdell & Toupin [58] and

Kovetz [30] call H = H(F ) aether relation (we chose the historically more neutral expression

“spacetime relation”).

7 In Okun’s Sec.11, “Concluding remarks,” the Global Positioning System is cited and its relation to GR.
However, it is apparently not conceived as a problem related to (non-Poincar´e covariant) electrodynamics.

If one knows the spacetime relation (15) with (21) or, more compactly, in exterior calculus,

(22), then one can eliminate H from the Maxwell equations and ends up with (26). Then

F = (E, B) is left over and the gravitational ﬁeld is encoded into the Hodge star ⋆. However,

with equal right one could eliminate F . The Hodge dual of (22) reads F =

dH = J ,

d ⋆H = 0 .

17

Ω0

⋆H . Thus,

−

(31)

Now H = (

,

) is left over, like in Lorentz’s electron theory of 1904 [34]. However, by no

H

D

covariant means one is ever led to Okun’s choice of the pair E, H, unless one enforces some

strange units in order to accommodate E, H as fundamental variables in electrodynamics.

With E and H one cannot build up a generally covariant quantity. One is caught in ﬂat

spacetime in Cartesian coordinates with strange units.

The book of Sommerfeld [57] that, according to Okun, is “prerelativistic” even contains a

discussion of GR and the Schwarzschild solution, in contrast to Okun’s pre-general relativistic

discussion of electrodynamics in his Sec.10. Okun refers to the “spirit of special relativity”

and what this spirit tells him in regard to E, B, H, D, namely to put D = E and H = B,

but we look in vain for a corresponding enlightenment by the “spirit of general relativity.”

B. Theory of dimensions

Okun doesn’t present a theory of dimensions as, e.g., Schouten & Dorgelo [54] or Post [45]

do. Accordingly, he doesn’t distinguish between dimensions and units. An SI-unit can be

badly chosen. This does not imply, however, that the corresponding dimension is defective.

One should compare Sommerfeld [57] for a clear distinction between dimensions and units.

Okun’s attack against SI — see the last but one sentence of his abstract — is without proper

theoretical foundation.

Let us compare the dimensions of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in Okun’s approach to the

ones in our approach. Okun: [E] = [H]. This is apparently meant for Cartesian coordinates.

We are not told what the dimension is. It is gratifying to learn that the dimension of the 3D

vector ﬁeld E (electric ﬁeld strength) is the same as that of the 3D vector ﬁeld H (magnetic

excitation)! This will help our experimental colleagues greatly. The SI-unit used by Okun

for H is8 tesla. This is incorrect, it is A/m.

8 See two lines before Okun’s eq.(7).

18

Incidentally, Okun is here in good company, his well-known experimental colleague Fitch

[13] comes up with the following: ”... any system that gives E and B diﬀerent units, when

they are related through a relativistic transformation, is on the far side of sanity.” Obviously

Fitch, very much like Okun, doesn’t consider dimensions nor distinguishes an absolute from

a relative dimension. To repeat: The 4D ﬁeld strength F has absolute dimension [F ] = φ
(magnetic ﬂux). But in 3D, we have the absolute dimensions [E] = φ/t SI= V , [B] = φ SI= V s =
Wb and the relative dimensions [Ea] = φ/(t ℓ) SI= V /m, [Bab] = φ/ℓ2 SI= Wb/m2 = tesla = T ,
see Table 1. Hence clearly E and B do have diﬀerent dimensions and diﬀerent unit and we

are apparently “on the far side of sanity.”

It should be stressed that our article is not in any sense “pro-SI”. It is rather aimed at

a clean discussion of the theory of dimensions that leads to the electric and the magnetic

constants ε0 and µ0, inter alia. A priori, this has nothing to do with any choice of units.

One shouldn’t mix these two things. A lot of Okun’s anti-SI discussion is directed against

an appropriate dimensional analysis. The real question is whether one prefers ”numerical

equations” or ”quantity equations”. Okun opts for the ﬁrst choice, we for the second one.

Speciﬁcally in SI, also the point of view of quantity equations is adopted.

C. Vacuum polarization and vacuum permittivity/permeability

Vacuum polarization described by QED emerges in a special relativistic context. By the

same token, the notions of permittivity and permeability of the vacuum are consistent with

SR.

Okun: “Let us stress that this polarization has nothing to do with purely classical non-

unit values of ε0 and µ0.” Heisenberg and Euler [20], who “invented” the subject, had a

diﬀerent opinion: Vacuum polarization in QED, in a semi-classical approximation, can be

understood such that Maxwell’s equations in terms of E,

,

, B remain the same, but the

D

H

relations between

and E and

and B get modiﬁed, see [20], Eqs.(1) and (2). Clearly,

D

H

the spacetime relations (18) are perturbed by the vacuum polarization of QED, provided a

semiclassical approximation is suﬃcient.

X. CONCLUSIONS

19

The appropriate structure and the real beauty of classical electrodynamics is, in our

opinion, expressed in the generally covariant equations (4) and (22): dH = J, dF = 0

and H = ⋆F/Ω0. Okun’s equations Ref.[43], (20,21,22) have a more restricted domain of

applicability: they are only valid in ﬂat Minkowskian spacetime in Cartesian coordinates. A

dimensional analysis of Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics yields the speed of light c and the

wave resistance of the vacuum Ω0 as the two quantities characterizing the electromagnetic

properties of spacetime.

For Continuum Mechanics and Other Classical Field Theories

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

Serious mathematical defect in the important kinematics theorem known in continuum mechanics
as Convection (or Transport) Theorem is reported. We claim that the traditional demonstration does
not take into account a special constraint on integrand functions given in Lagrangian representation.
Thus, we put in doubt that the traditional procedure for the transition from integral formulations
of physical laws of some classical ﬁeld theories to their diﬀerential form is mathematically rigorous.
Reconsidered formulation shows the way how the system of fundamental diﬀerential equations of
continuum mechanics and some other ﬁeld theories could be modiﬁed without any change of the
original integral formulation. The continuity equation and the diﬀerential form of the equation of
motion for continuous media are discussed as examples of modiﬁcation.

I.

INTRODUCTION

At present, a huge amount of experimental data has
been accumulated on deformable bodies, ﬂuids, gases and
plasmas. Mathematical understanding of their behavior,
internal relationship between diﬀerent concepts, models
and observed phenomena are expressed in comprehensive
modern descriptions generally referred as hydrodynam-
ics, elasticity theory, electromagnetism, magnetohydro-
dynamics, plasma physics (as regards to the latter, nowa-
days a special priority, attention and technical support
have been given to the solution of problems of thermonu-
clear reaction as alternative source of energy). The most
part of inner links between these autonomous branches of
scientiﬁc knowledge is mainly due to the common mathe-
matical apparatus of continuum mechanics which brings
them together as a part of a more general scheme.

Having in mind this unity of mathematical basis for all
above-mentioned subdivisions of physics and mechanics,
we shall refer in this work only to a mechanical theory of
motion of continuous media which constitutes a signiﬁ-
cant part of continuum mechanics. The development of
the theory of ordinary and partial diﬀerential equations,
integral equation, diﬀerential geometry etc had great in-
ﬂuence on conceptual, logical and mathematical struc-
ture of continuum mechanics and vise versa. In historical
retrospective, it is now commonly accepted that the con-
solidation of mathematical and conceptual fundamentals
of the theory of continuum mechanics was achieved by
the end of the 19th century and, in main terms, coin-
cided with the rigorization of the analysis completed by
Weierstrass [1].

However, very recent indications [2] on ill-founded
analysis in mathematical hydrodynamics put in doubt
the fact that the process of rigorization of the funda-
mentals of classical ﬁeld theory had been brought to the
end in a correct way. More precisely, a detailed insight
towards Lagrangian and Eulerian types of analytical de-
scription conventionally accepted for kinematics of con-
tinuous media shows that no equal standards of rigor
are implied in both approaches to time derivatives. A

reconsidered account [2] provided a mathematically rig-
orous analytical approach to the treatment of total time
derivative in properly Eulerian description. Another se-
rious defect had been detected in the demonstration of
an important kinematics theorem known also as Convec-
tion (or Reynolds’ Transport) Theorem [2]. Elimination
of both defects provided a necessary cross-veriﬁcation for
a modiﬁed diﬀerential form of continuity equation [2].

In what follows, one of our immediate purposes will
be to ﬁx basic conceptions of mathematical foundations
of continuum mechanics and then we shall proceed to
show the failure in the logic of the traditional approach
to the formulation of the Convection Theorem and how
its reconsideration motivates a new form of diﬀerential
equations of motion for continuous media.

II. BASIC DESCRIPTIONS IN CONTINUUM
MECHANICS

The basic mathematical idea of kinematics is that a
continuous medium can be consistently conceived as an
abstract geometrical object (for instance, collection of
spatially distributed points etc). Thus, any deformation
and motion is immediately associated with appropriate
geometrical transformation [3]-[4]. Since any motion is
always determined with respect to some reference frame,
let us introduce a ﬁxed coordinate system. To simplify
our approach in order to highlight the nature of the de-
fects inherent in the conventional demonstration of the
Convection Theorem, we begin with the simplest assump-
tions of continuous geometrical transformations.

Actual mathematical formalism implies two comple-
mentary general descriptions of ﬂow ﬁeld kinematics.
One of them, called Eulerian description (or represen-
tation), identiﬁes a ﬁxed volume element or a ﬁxed point
of space in a chosen reference system. All medium prop-
erties are described only as a function of local position r
and time t. These independent variables are frequently
regarded as Eulerian variables.

The other approach, called Lagrangian description,
identiﬁes an individual bit of continuous medium (charac-

terized by an initial closure Ω0) or a point-particle (char-
acterized by an initial position-vector a) at some chosen
time instant and gives account of the medium properties
along their trajectory. This approach associates non-zero
motion with a non-zero continuous geometrical transfor-
mation Ht. Thus, the set HtΩ0 (or a position-vector Hta)
represents the same individual bit of continuous medium
(or point-particle) at time t. Continuity requirement on
Ht involves a natural limitation: the bounding surface of
the closure HtΩ0 always consists of the same medium
i.e. ∂Ωt = Ht∂Ω0 and there is no ﬂux of
elements,
medium particles through the boundary at any instants
of time. Thus, under this conditions the transformation
Hta is always the point transformation and the function
Hta = r(t, a) describes a law of motion of a point. The
position-vector a denotes the initial position of an indi-
vidual particle and, therefore, can be used as a label for
constant identiﬁcation of the particle at any instant of
time. An initial set of identiﬁed particles is equivalent to
the set of labels {a} regarded sometimes as Lagrangian
parameters. The assumption on continuity of geometrical
transformation Ht is equivalent to the requirement that
the function r(t, a), which describes the law of motion,
possesses continuous partial derivatives with respect to
all variables, i.e. t and a.

In considering the motion of continuous medium as
a set of individual mutually interacting point-particles
(or volume bits), Lagrangian approach is indispensable
implying by it the individualization
as the ﬁrst step,
of particles by a set of labels {a}. Thus, it should be
emphasized again that the geometrical transformation
Hta = r(a,t) gives the complete picture of a motional his-
tory for every individual particle from the set {a}. The
detailed description of the law of motion implies an intro-
duction of certain additional concepts such as the veloc-
ity and acceleration of particles of a continuous medium.
In Lagrangian description velocity and acceleration are
deﬁned as the ﬁrst and the second order partial time
derivative with respect to r, respectively:

In the context of Eulerian description, a priori there
is no identiﬁcation and hence no explicit consideration
of the function r = r(t, a). The primary notion is the
velocity ﬁeld as a function of position r in space and
time t on some domain of a continuous medium:

dr
dt

= v(t, r)

(2.2)

where variables r and t are independent.

Picking up some initial point a = r(t0), one selects
from a congruence (a set of integral curves of (2.2))
a unique solution. Thus, a formulation of the initial
Cauchy problem

2

dr
dt

= v(t, r);

r(t0) = a

(2.3)

is mathematically equivalent to an act of identiﬁcation,
allowing any solution of (2.3) to be represented as in La-
grangian description r = r(t, a). There is a general con-
sensus that this procedure can be taken as a rule for
translating from one to the other description. Thus, if
some medium quantity f is deﬁned in Eulerian represen-
tation as f (t, r), then there is an obvious translation rule
to its Lagrangian representation [4]:

g(t, a) = f (t, r(t, a))

(2.4)

Convective (or Euler’s material) derivative is intro-

duced as:

∂
∂t

d
dt

g(t, a) =

f (t, r(t, a)) =

+ (v · ∇)f (2.5)

Df

=

∂f
∂t

Now we are in a position to consider an important kine-
matics theorem which concerns the time rate of change of
f -content of any volume integral (i.e. not only inﬁnites-
imal volume elements). Its formulation can be found in
any basic text on ﬂuid dynamics or elasticity theory. For
our convenience, we shall use the exposition and sym-
bolic notations implemented in [4]. As the ﬁrst step, let
us deﬁne f -content of some deformable moving volume
domain Ωt and its time derivative in Eulerian and La-
grangian representations, respectively:

F (t) =

f (t, r)dV ;

f (t, r)dV

and

Z
Ωt
∂
∂t Z
Ωt

dF

=

g(t, a)dV

(2.7)

where Ωt = HtΩ0.

The geometrical transformation Ht is algebraically rep-
∂Hta

resented by the Jacobian determinant J = det
which has the following partial time derivative [4]:

where (∇ · v) = divv.

(2.8)

Thus, in the framework of Lagrangian representation
the evolution of a medium f -content can be written in

Z

g(t, a)JdV0 =

(g(t, a)J)dV0

(2.9)

where g(t, a) should be evaluated in the volume set Ω0,
i.e. under the condition r(t, a) = a.
In fact, this is
only meaningful just for the initial conﬁguration of point-
particles {r(t0, a) = a} which continuously ﬁll up the
original domain Ω0. Therefore, taking into account this
constraint

[g(t, a)]r(t,a)=a = [f (t, r(t, a))]r(t,a)=a = f (t, a)

(2.10)

we can proceed to evaluate the following partial time
derivative:

∂
∂t

∂
∂t

(g(t, a)J) =

(f (t, a)J) =

J + f (∇ · v)J (2.11)

and it suﬃce to note that

where we remind that the right-hand side of the expres-
sion (2.13) or (2.15) implies the condition t → t0, i.e.
Ωt → Ω0 and corresponding integrands are represented
in Eulerian variables attached to the ﬁxed spatial refer-
ence system. Thus, to end this Section, we conclude that
the Convection Theorem as well as the demonstrational
procedure it involves are important mathematical tools
in order to describe relationship between Lagrangian and
Eulerian representations for the set of fundamental equa-
tions of continuum mechanics.

III. CONSERVATION LAW AND MODIFIED
DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION OF MOTION

One of the primary fundamental equations of contin-
uum mechanics is the diﬀerential equation for the law of
conservation of the mass of any closed volume element,
i.e. continuity equation. Let us choose the modiﬁed ver-
sion of the Convection Theorem:

D
Dt Z
Vt

ρ(t, r)dV =

+ ρ div(v)

dV = 0

(3.1)

=

Ω0

∂f

(cid:20)

+ f (∇ · v)
(cid:21)

JdV0

(2.12)

Hence,

the ﬁrst modiﬁed fundamental diﬀerential
equation of continuum mechanics given in Eulerian rep-
resentation would take the form

which lead to the modiﬁed formulation of the Convection
Theorem:

Theorem 1 : Let v be a vector ﬁeld generating a ﬂuid
ﬂow through a ﬁxed 3-dimensional domain V and if
f (r, t) ∈ C1( ¯V ), then

f dV =

+ f (∇ · v))dV

(2.13)

D
Dt Z
Ωt

(

∂f
∂t

Z
Ωt

where dV denotes the ﬁxed volume element.

The formulation of (2.13) diﬀers form the convention-
ally accepted result. The defect in the traditional demon-
stration resides in the fact that the relation (2.10) was
not taken into account (for instance, see [4]). In fact, if
we take a partial time derivative (2.11) straightforwardly,
i.e. without the constrain (2.10), we obtain:

∂
∂t

(g(t, a)J) =

(g(t, a)J) =

J + f (∇ · v)J (2.14)

∂
∂t

Df
Dt

that leads to the traditional formulation of the Convec-
tion Theorem [4]:

∂ρ
∂t

+ ρ div(v) = 0

(3.2)

where ρ is the mass density. The equation (3.2) can
be regarded as a modiﬁed continuity equation which was
already independently obtained due to reconsidered ap-
proach to total time derivatives in properly Eulerian de-
scription [2]. Mathematical soundness and applicability
of the equation (3.2) was also analytically veriﬁed on a
simple one-dimension example of an ideal ﬂow (see Ap-
pendix B in [2]).

In continuum mechanics, there are many physical
quantities such as linear and angular momentums, energy
as well as some other scalar, vector or tensor character-
istics which undergo time variations during the motion
of any given volume of a medium. If this quantities are
continuous functions of the coordinates everywhere inside
the spatial domain Vt, then the mathematical procedure
used for the demonstration of the Convection Theorem
(2.13) also remains valid. Thus, for any moving individ-
ual macroscopic volume Vt, the equation for time varia-
tion of linear momentum will take the following form for
each spatial component vi of the velocity vector v:

D
Dt Z
Ωt

(

+ ρvi div(v)

∂ρvi

(cid:20)

(cid:21)

The concept of force is introduced in continuum me-
chanics phenomenologically by analogy with classical me-
chanics. In other words, diﬀerent forces which act on the
volume Vt are responsible for the time variation of mo-
mentum:

D

(3.4)

Z

where f is a density of all external mass forces and P is
a surface stress force represented by a stress tensor P ik.
The diﬀerential form of the relation (3.4) written in
components is often regarded as equation of motion of a
continuous medium in Eulerian coordinates of the ﬁxed
reference system:

∂ρvi
∂t

+ ρvi ∂vk

∂xk = ρf i +
where v=
xi
. Takin into account that
the modiﬁed continuity equation (3.2) can be rewritten
(cid:9)
in components as:

and r =

(3.5)

vi

(cid:8)

(cid:9)

(cid:8)

∂P ik
∂xk

the equation of motion (3.5) takes a more simple form:

∂ρ
∂t

+ ρ

∂vk
∂xk = 0

ρ

∂vi
∂t

= f iρ +

∂P ik
∂xk

(3.6)

(3.7)

Importantly to emphasize that no changes were as-
sumed for the analytical representation of forces in the
right-hand side of (3.4). The modiﬁcation is concerned
only the left-hand side of (3.4) which refers to the time
variation of momentum. Thus, in the traditional ap-
proach the partial time derivative ∂vi
is replaced by Eu-
ler’s derivative Dvi
Dt .

Nevertheless, we shall limit our consideration here only
by examples of mass and linear momentum time varia-
tions since they suﬃce to show the way how the system
of fundamental diﬀerential equation of continuum me-
chanics and other ﬁeld theories could be modiﬁed. To
conclude the Section, we would like to stress another im-
portant feature of the given approach: reconsidered fun-
damental diﬀerential equations of continuum mechanics

∂t

can be derived without any change in their original inte-
gral formulation.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Rational examination of mathematical foundations of
continuum mechanics as being of central importance and
wide appeal in physical ﬁeld theories, shows serious de-
fect at the very basic level. To be more speciﬁc, we claim
to have found that the traditional demonstration of the
important kinematics theorem of continuum mechanics
known as Convection (or Transport) Theorem does not
take into account a special constraint on integrand func-
tions given in Lagrangian representation and, as a con-
sequence, it is not already based on a mathematically
rigorous approach.

Any modiﬁcation of the conventional procedure would
imply undeniable changes in the set of basic diﬀerential
equations of continuum mechanics as well as some other
autonomous branches of physical science such as electro-
magnetism, magnetohydrodynamics, plasma physics etc.
Moreover, in this work we show that these modiﬁcations
would not be accompanied by any change in correspond-
ing integral formulations, leaving them untouched. The
latter fact is important from the practical meaning, since
the prevailing amount of experimental data in physical
ﬁeld theories was basically classiﬁed in form of integral
laws. Thus, the major point that emerges from the above
considerations is that the traditional transition from orig-
inal integral formulations of physical laws of classical ﬁeld
theories to their diﬀerential form may come in conﬂict
with the mathematical rigor.

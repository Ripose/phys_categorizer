The discussion of our recent work concerning the vector solution of boundary-value problems in
electromagnetism is extended to the case of no azimuthal symmetry by means of the spin-weighted
spherical harmonics.

Keywords: Maxwell equations; electric and magnetic ﬁelds; boundary-value problems; spin-weighted
spherical harmonics.

Se extiende la discusi´on de nuestro trabajo reciente sobre la soluci´on vectorial de problemas con val-
ores de frontera en electromagnetismo al caso sin simetr´ıa azimutal mediante el uso de los arm´onicos
esf´ericos con peso de esp´ın.

Descriptores: Ecuaciones de Maxwell; campos el´ectrico y magn´etico; problemas con valores de fron-
tera; arm´onicos esf´ericos con peso de esp´ın.

In a recent paper [1], we introduced a somewhat dif-
ferent approach to solving boundary-value problems in
spherical coordinates for time-independent and time-
dependent electric and magnetic ﬁelds, without involv-
ing the scalar and vector potentials. We showed that
the process includes the same mathematics of separation
of variables as the usual approach of solving for poten-
tials. However, it is restricted by the assumption of az-
imuthal symmetry. We now wish to remove this con-
straint. So the natural complete orthonormal set of ex-
pansion functions to consider for the vector solutions of
Maxwell equations are the spin-weighted spherical har-
monics [2, 3, 4, 5]. The purpose of this note is to recast
the general vector solutions for the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds and illustrate their applications on boundary-value
problems by dealing, for simplicity’s sake, with the com-
monplace examples solved in Ref. [1].

For time-independent electric and magnetic phenom-
ena, the ﬁelds outside sources satisfy the vector Laplace
F =
equation
0. The general solution in terms of the spin-weighted
spherical harmonics sYlm [4], with spin weight s = 0,
1
and 0Ylm = Ylm, can be written as

We remark that F+ = F− in the case of boundary-
value problems having azimuthal symmetry with Fϕ = 0.
This implies that clm = dlm = 0 in Eqs. (2) and (4),
which leads in turn to the solutions obtained in Ref. [1].
The boundary conditions for the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds must be expressed in terms of their spin-weighted
components. Assuming that the boundary surface is a

To illustrate the use of the above formulas for static
ﬁelds, we choose the example of the electric ﬁeld due to
a ring having radius a with total charge Q uniformly dis-
tributed and lying in the x-y plane, which is also worked
out in Ref. [1]. The surface charge density on r = a,
localized at θ = π/2, is

with the corresponding component of the surface charge
density ρS obtained from Eqs. (6) and (7), exhibiting the
unity of the multipole expansions of ﬁelds and sources.

As an example of time-varying ﬁelds, we consider the
problem of the magnetic induction ﬁeld from a current
I = I◦e−iωt in a circular loop of radius a lying in the x-y
plane. The surface current density on r = a is

JS =

δ(cos θ) e

(10)

where for the delta function we now use the expansion

Taking into account the cylindrical symmetry of the sys-
tem and the requirement that the series solutions in
Eqs. (1) and (2) be ﬁnite at the origin, vanish at inﬁnity
and satisfy the boundary conditions of Eq. (5) at r = a
for all values of the angle θ, namely, E± continuous at
r = a and E0 discontinuous at r = a, it is found that the
spin-weighted components of the electric ﬁeld are given

from Eqs. (10) and (11).

Finally, by using the expressions of the spin-weighted
spherical harmonics in Eqs. (8), (9), (12) and (13), it is
seen that the results in Ref. [1] are obtained.

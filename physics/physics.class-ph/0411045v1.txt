Abstract

We show that the image by the Lorentz transformation of a spherical (circular)
light wave, emitted by a moving source, is not a spherical (circular) wave but an
ellipsoidal (elliptical) light wave. Poincar´e’s ellipsoid (ellipse) is the direct geometrical
representation of Poincar´e’s relativity of simultaneity. Einstein’s spheres (circles)
are the direct geometrical representation of Einstein’s convention of synchronisation.
Poincar´e adopts another convention for the deﬁnition of space-time units involving
that the Lorentz transformation of an unit of length is directly proportional to
Lorentz transformation of an unit of time. Poincar´e’s relativistic kinematics predicts
both a dilation of time and an expansion of space as well.

1 Introduction: Einstein’s Spherical Wavefront

& Poincar´e’s Ellipsoidal Wavefront

Einstein writes in 1905, in the third paragraph of his famous paper :

At the time t = τ = 0, when the origin of the two coordinates (K and k)
is common to the two systems, let a spherical wave be emitted therefrom,
and be propagated -with the velocity c in system K. If x, y, z be a point just
attained by this wave, then

Transforming this equation with our equations of transformation (see Ein-

stein’s LT, 29), we obtain after a simple calculation

The wave under consideration is therefore no less a spherical wave with ve-
locity of propagation c when viewed in the moving system k. [Einstein A.1905]

Poincar´e writes in 1908 in his second paper on ”La dynamique de l’´electron” with the

subtitle ”Le principe de relativit´e”:

Imagine an observer and a source involved together in the transposition.
The wave surfaces emanating for the source will be spheres, having as centre
the successive positions of the source. The distance of this centre from the
present position of the source will be proportional to the time elapsed since the
emission - that is to say, to the radius of the sphere. But for our observer, on
account of the contraction, all these spheres will appear as elongated ellip-
soids. The compensation is now exact, and this is explained by Michelson’s
experiments. [Poincar´e H. (1908)]

We can further ﬁnd in Poincar´e’s text the equation (two dimensions) of an elongated
light ellipse whose observer at rest (let us call him: O) is situated at the centre and whose
source S (with ”our observer”, let us call him O’) in moving is situated at the focus F of
the ellipse.

The contrast between both great relativists, Einstein et Poincar´e, about an experiment
that seems to be the same (the image of a spherical wave emitted by a moving source) is
very clear: according to Einstein, the image of a spherical wave is a spherical wave whilst
according to Poincar´e the image of a spherical wave (around O) is an ellipsoidal wave.
Does the latter not know the invariance of the quadratic form? Not at all because he
does demonstrate, with the structure of group, in his ﬁrst paper on ,”La dynamique de
l’´electron” [Poincar´e H. 1905], that the Lorentz Transformation (LT) ”doesn’t modify the
quadratic form x2 + y2 + z2
c2t2”. We must point out that Poincar´e’s lengthened light
waves has been completely ignored for a whole century by the scientiﬁc community 1. We
note also that Poincar´e doesn’t use LT in the previous quotation and directly deduces the
ellipsoidal shape of the light wavefront from the principle of contraction of (the unit) of
length (see conclusion).

−

So who is right: Einstein or Poincar´e? The best thing that we can do, to solve this

dilemma, is to apply a LT to a spherical wavefront.

2 Image by LT of the Object ”Circular Wave”

What is the image (the shape) in K of a spherical wave emitted in t′ = t = 0 by a source
S at rest in the origin O’ of K’ ? The LT deﬁned by Poincar´e is:

x′ = k(x

εt)

−

y′ = y

t′ = k(t

εx)

(3)

We keep Poincar´e’s notations where ε, k correspond to Einstein-Planck’s notations β, γ
because, according to Poincar´e in his 1905 work about the theory of relativity, ”I shall
choose the units of length and of time in such a way that the velocity of light is equal to
unity” [Poincar´e H. 1905]. The deep meaning of Poincar´e’s choice of space-time units with
c = 1 will be speciﬁed in the conclusion. In order to have one only wavefront, we have

1Poincar´e’s ellipsoidal wavefront was in fact mentioned in his course of 1905-1906 ”Les limites de la loi de
Newton” [Poincar´e H. (1906)]. We also ﬁnd them in ”La M´ecanique Nouvelle” (1909) [Poincar´e H. (1909)].
In fact it was in 1904 at a talk in Saint Louis that Poincar´e ﬁrst introduced the elongated ellipsoidal wave-
front as an alternative and not as a consequence of the contraction of the unit of length [Poincar´e H. (1904)].

to deﬁne a time t′ as unit of time 1t′. The equation of the circular wave front in K’ (the
geometrical locus of the object-points in K’) in t′ = 1 is :

The unprimed coordinates of the image-points are given by the inverse LT:

x′

2 + y′

2 = t′

2 = 1t′

x = k(x′ + εt′)

y = y′

t = k(t′ + εx′)

The coordinates (0, 0, 1) in K of the source in t′ = 1 are (kε, 0, k) and (kεt′, 0, kt′) in t′

= 1.
Let us determine the images (x, y, t) in K of diﬀerent object-points in t′ = 1 : (1, 0, 1),
1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1), ( √2
2 , 1) etc. (see ﬁgure 1 in annex). The image-point E, k(1 +

Let us show now that Poincar´e is right and all the image-points of the circular wavefront
in K’ are on an elliptical wavefront. By introducing , in the system K’, the angle θ′
determined by both the radius vector r’ and the Ox’ axes, we have x′ = r′ cos θ′ et y′ =
r′ sin θ′. So with r′ = t′

= 1 we have:

which is the temporal LT (5), t = k(t′+ εx′), with x′ = r′cosθ′ = t′cosθ′. We can also

write (r = t) the locus of the images-points:

t = kt′(1 + εcosθ′)

r = kr′(1 + εcosθ′)

t = r = k(1 + εcosθ′)

If r′ = t′ = 1 (ﬁgure1), we then have:

We will show now that this ”temporal equation” (6) or ”normal equation”(7) is the
equation of an ellipse in polar coordinates if we deﬁne the polar angle θ (see ﬁgure 2 in
annex) as the relativistic transformation of the angle θ′(paragraph 3).

3 Poincar´e’s Elongated Ellipse and the Relativity of

Simultaneity

Let us ﬁrst determine Poincar´e’s elongated ellipse in Cartesian coordinates. We are seeking
for the space shape of the wavefront t′ = 1 in K, given the invariance of the quadratic form:

If the time t were ﬁxed (see paragraph 4 on Einstein’s synchronisation), we would obviously
have a circular wavefront; but t depends by LT on x′. If t’ is written in function of x’, we
would not have the image of the wave in K. We must write t in function of x . By using

the ﬁrst and the third (x and t) LT (5), we have respectively if r′ = t′

t = k−

1t′ + εx

t = k−

1 + εx

We immediately obtain the Cartesian equation of Poincar´e’s elongated ellipse respec-

tively if r′ = t′

= 1 and r′ = t′ = 1 (ﬁgure2):

x2 + y2 = (k−

1t′ + εx)2

x2 + y2 = (k−

At once we check that Poincar´e’s ellipse, by replacing x’

The image-points (ﬁgure 2) are situated on Poincar´e’s elongated ellipse2, with Observer
O at the focus F and Source S at the centre C. The eccentricity of the ellipse is ε = kε
k
where k is the length of the great axis (we choose, in ﬁgure 2, the small axis of the ellipse
r′ = t′ = 1). The equation of Poincar´e’s ellipse can be written in polar coordinates with
pole O, focus F and the polar angle θ deﬁned in K (with both standard parameters of the
ellipse e, p):

Thus we obtain from (16 and 7) the formula of relativistic transformation of angle

r = kr′(1 + εcosθ′)

1 + ε cos θ′

So it is now utterly demonstrated that Poincar´e is right and that the geometrical image
by LT of a circular wavefront is an elongated ellipse its polar equation being (16) and its
Cartesian equation being (12). Poincar´e’s ellipse gives the other formulae of aberration, in
particular:

It is now essential to interpret the historical case (see introduction and footnote 2)
considered by Poincar´e (in connection with Michelson’s experiment where the source is on
the Earth, see conclusion): the circular light wavefronts are developed around O (the ether
is now by deﬁnition at rest relative to K): r = t = 1. What is the image of the circular locus
of the points (determined now by θ) seen from O’ (where the source is at rest in K’, ”system
of the Earth”)? Given that Poincar´e’s ellipse I, in the ﬁrst case, is directly inscribed in
LT, it is easy to deﬁne Poincar´e’s ellipse II, in the second case, both by inverting in (7)
the primed and the unprimed and by changing the sign of ε. The ”normal” equation of
Poincar´e’s (historical) ellipse II is therefore:

r′ = kr(1

r′ = r

The polar equation of Poincar´e’s ellipse II, its source S (in O’, ”on the Earth” ) in
moving occupies the focus F∗ (see ﬁgure 2) and the observer O occupies the centre C is
(with 18):

The ”normal” (temporal) equation of the ellipse I then is the polar equation of the

ellipse II. The Cartesian equation of Poincar´e’s ellipse II is:

So in Poincar´e’s relativistic kinematics we can have, with no contradiction at all, an

elliptical wavefront in the system of the source.

What is now the physical interpretation of Poincar´e’s elongated ellipse? We under-

line, at this stage, three points (for the relativistic Doppler eﬀect, see conclusion):

1) Poincar´e’s elongated ellipse is the direct translation of the ”headlight eﬀect”: the
isotropic emission of a moving source is not isotropic seen from the rest system (relativistic
transformation of angles θ′into θ). In three dimensions of space the reduction of the angle
of aperture of the cone of emission of a moving source is physically (synchrotron radiation,

5

bremsstrahlung...) represented, on the whole (from any angle), by the ellipsoidal shape of
the wavefront.

2) Poincar´e’s elongated ellipse is the direct translation of the relativity of simul-
taneity: the set of simultaneous events in K’ of the spherical wavefront in time t’ is not
a set of simultaneous events in K, in time t. In particular, if the two events (1, 0, 1) et
1, 0, 1) are simultaneous in K’, they are not simultaneous (6), k(1 + ε), 0, k(1 + ε) and
(
−
k(1
ε), in K. Let us also note that the image of the distance ”2” between these
two events in K’ is elongated ”2k” in K. These two fundamental points put the emphasis
on the fact that Poincar´e’s ellipse is not only a geometrical image but also a physical shape
of the wavefront.

ε), 0, k(1

−

−

3) Poincar´e’s elongated ellipse is the direct translation of Poincar´e’s completely rel-
ativistic3 ether: put the ether at rest in one (K) or in the other system (K’ ) is exactly
equivalent to deﬁne the ellipse with the direct LT or the inverse LT. So in Poincar´e’s own
words: if t’ is the true time (”circular” time), t then is the local time (”elliptical” time) and
inversely (by LT) if t is the true time (”circular” time), t’ then is the local time (”elliptical”
time). That is completely relativistic and Poincar´e’s elongated ellipse is ”the immediate
interpretation of Michelson experimental result”(see conclusion).

Poincar´e’s ether is relativistic but not deleted (as Einstein’s one) because it remains
the relativistic deﬁnition of state of rest: when we choose by deﬁnition ether at rest in one
system (spheres or true time), it is not at rest in the other system (ellipsoids or local time).
Objectively we have two possibilities to choose the criterion of the relativistic state of
rest of a system: the source of light or the medium of light. In Einstein-Minkowski’s
relativistic kinematics, the criterion is clearly the source (the proper system, see paragraph
4 ).
In Poincar´e’s relativistic kinematics, the criterion is clearly the ether (”circular
waves”).

That is a paramount diﬀerence because in Einstein-Minkowski’s proper system (see
paragraph 4) we always have by deﬁnition spherical waves or in other words, the equality
between forth travel time and back travel time. It is not the case with Poincar´e’s deﬁnition
of units where we can have without any contradiction, an elliptical wavefront (a local time)
in the system of the source (see conclusion). Poincar´e’s relativistic duality between true
time and local time doesn’t correspond to Einstein-Minkowski’s relativistic duality between
proper time and improper time (paragraph 4).

4 Einstein’s kinematics:

identical spheres, identical

rigid rods and convention of synchronisation

If according to Einstein, the object (1) and the image (2), are both spherical and concentric
within the two systems, then two simultaneous events in K, for example (1, 0, 1) and (-1,
0, 1), must be also simultaneous in k.

That seems in contradiction not only with Poincar´e’s ellipse but also with Einstein’s
well known deﬁnition of relativity of simultaneity. Therefore the image by LT in k of a
spherical wave in K cannot be a spherical wave. So it could appear at this stage that
Poincar´e is right and Einstein is wrong.

However the question is: ”What in Einstein’s reasoning is true?”. Let us return to

3Poincar´e is philosophically very anti-absolutist as well [Poincar´e H. (1907)].

Einstein’s 1905 quotation (paragraph 1). The two quadratic forms x2 + y2 + z2 = c2t2
and ξ2 + η2 + ζ 2 = c2τ 2 are the geometrical equations of two spheres (two circles in two
dimensions or two equidistant points respectively from O and O’ in one dimension). Let
us note that the young Einstein doesn’t specify, in the previous quotation, in which system
the source is at rest. So if we consider4 now that we have two identical sources, in O’ and
O, emitting a signal of light simultaneously at the time,

the physical situation is perfectly identical in each system (Einstein’s deletion of ether5).
So we must have two identical spherical wavefronts, x2 + y2 + z2 = c2 around O and
ξ2 + η2 + ς 2 = c2 around O’, simultaneously at the time

τ = t = 0

τ = t = 1t = 1τ

(23)

(24)

It immediately follows from the latter choice of two identical units of time that we have two
identical units of length 1x = 1ξ = c1t = c1τ . Let us point out that the travel time of the
circular wavefront either to the right or to the left (on the x, ξ axis) are identical within
the two systems. Einstein’s deﬁnition of identical units of time is therefore completely
coherent with Einstein’s identical rigid rods ( 1t = 1τ is on the other hand incompatible
with Poincar´e’s deﬁnition of units, see conclusion). Einstein writes in this sense in 1905:

Let there be given a stationary rigid rod; and let its length be L0 as measured
by a measuring-rod which is also stationary.
In accordance with the principle
of relativity the length of the rod in the moving system - must be equal to the
length L0 of the stationary rod . [Einstein A.1905]

In this respect, M. Born is perhaps the only physicist who underlined that the young

Einstein introduces in fact a tacit assumption (1921):

A ﬁxed rod that is at rest in the system K and is of length 1 cm, will, of
course, also have the length 1 cm, when it is at rest in the system k. We may
call this tacit assumption of Einstein’s theory the principle of the physical
[Born M.]
identity of the units of measure.

Einstein’s principle of identity (see also [Weisskopf V. (1)]) stipulates L0 = 1x = 1ξ =

c1t = c1τ and therefore (24) becomes

τ = t =

L0
c

(25)

There are two Einstein’s spherical waves and each spherical wave deﬁnes, in one di-
mension, two simultaneous events, (-1, 0, 1) and (-1, 0, 1), within each system (K and k).
4We can also consider that the emission is an event in a strong Einstein’s meaning and an event has
no velocity. We ﬁnd in Einstein’s introduction the enigmatic sentence ” The introduction of a ”lumine-
ferous ether” will prove to be superﬂuous inasmuch as the view here to be developped will not require an
”absolutely stationary space provided with special properties nor assign a velocity-vector to a point of the
empty space in which electromagnetic processes take place.” The emission by a source of light is an event
that has no velocity (see note 7) and therefore everything happens as if the source were at rest within each
system). [Pierseaux Y.(2), concept d’´ev´enement]

5Einstein’s deletion of ether is completely inseparable of Einstein’s photon (1905)[Pierseaux Y. (1)].

7

In other words: Einstein’s rigid rod (2L0) is deﬁned by two simultaneous events
within each system (K and k). Einstein’s spherical waves are not in contradiction
with ”Einstein’s relativity of simultaneity (after LT)” because it is ”Einstein’s convention
of simultaneity (before LT)” or in other words ”Einstein’s convention of synchronisation
of identical clocks in A and B with the exchange of a signal of light in K (before LT)”. Let
us now demonstrate that point by rigorously distinguishing the two stages of Einstein’s
deduction: before LT and after LT.

4.1 Before LT (the proper systems)

According to the young Einstein, ”It is essential to have time deﬁned by means of stationary
clocks in stationary system”. Einstein’s famous repetition of the concept ”stationary6” is
essential because he notices about his second system k (ξ, η, ζ, τ ):

To do this [deduce LT] we have to express in equations that τ is nothing else
than the set of data of clocks at rest in system k , which have been synchronized
[OB′ ] according to the rule given in paragraph 1 [OB ]

[Einstein A.1905].

Without any loss of generality we make A

O′) in young Ein-
stein’s notations (and then tA = τ A′ = 0). We have 2tB = t∗O in K (respectively 2τ B′ = τ ∗O′
in K (respectively c = 2 O′B′
in k ) and c = 2 OB
in k), with L0 = OB = O′B′, where tO = 0
τ ∗
t∗
O′
O
(respectively τ O′ = 0) is the time of emission of the light signal in K (respectively in k)
and t∗O (respectively τ ∗O′) is the time of reception of the light signal in B in K (respectively
in B’ k).

we ﬁnally have

tB = τ B′ =

Einstein’s interpretation of the invariant quadratic form as two physical spherical
wavefronts (1 & 2) is therefore exactly the same concept (see equations 23 and 27, 25
and 28) as Einstein’s 1905 convention of synchronisation within the two systems
(in one dimension where forth wavefront becomes forth time travel and back wavefront
becomes back time travel). The proper time T0, the duration between two events at
the same place, in young Einstein’s notation is t∗A (respectively τ ∗A′) or t∗O (respectively
τ ∗O′) with the identity between forth travel time and back travel time (factor 1
2). This is
Einstein’s synchronisation without contraction :OB = O′B′ (For Poincar´e’s convention of
synchronisation with contraction see J. Reignier [Reignier J.] and 7). We point out that
Einstein’s convention is not based on the choice of only one unit of length in one system

(28)

6The ether is at rest (or stationary) within the two systems and it is therefore superﬂuous. The deletion
of the medium of light involves the relativistic state of rest is deﬁned, by Einstein’s repetition with respect
to the source of light.

(see Poincar´e, conclusion) but on two identical units of length (B’ is not the image by LT
of B) within each system.

Historically Einstein deduced the identical units of time T0 from the identical units of
length L0 (index ”zero” means ”proper”) and from invariance of ”one way speed of light”
(see forth travel time and back travel time or the circular waves). We can as well, like
Minkowski [Minkowski H.], reverse that situation by deﬁning ﬁrst a proper time T0 and
next the proper length L0. This inversion seems avoid the rigid rods but in fact nothing is
changed because Einstein’s two spherical waves, Einstein’s convention of synchronisation,
Einstein’s rigid rods L0 and Minkowski’s ”Eigenzeit” are completely inseparable. Without
Einstein’s spheres (1 & 2), there is no Minkowski’s Eigenzeit because the relativistic state
of rest is deﬁned relatively to the source (see paragraph 3, third point and conclusion).

The main result in the framework of this paper however is not the deﬁnition of the

proper time but Einstein’s deﬁnition of proper length

Deﬁnition 1 The proper length, L0 = ξ2 −
time, τ = τ 1 = τ 1, in the proper system k (respectively, L0 = x2
time, t = t1 = t2, in the proper system K).

−

4.2 After LT (the improper systems)

Einstein’s construction of invariant quadratic form as physical spherical wavefront means
that Einstein (and Minkowski) deﬁnes the units before taking in account the relative ve-
locity v : Einstein’s units are completely independent 7 on the relative velocity v (and also
β and γ). Therefore there is no contradiction with LT, because the deﬁnition of space-time
units is a preparation of the two systems not only prior to the use of LT and even, more
fundamentally, prior to the deduction of LT (see note 4). Einstein’s 1905 deduction of LT
is very complicated but Einstein’s immediate 1907 deduction of LT from the invariance of
the quadratic form, i.e. the invariance of (one way [F. Selleri]) speed of light, has become
a classic [Einstein A.1907]:

If Einstein’s deﬁnition of space-time units is not in contradiction with LT, it requires on
the other hand a speciﬁc use of LT. In young Einstein’s words: ”We will call the length to
be discovered L the length of the (moving) rod in the stationary system”[Einstein A.1905].
In current words, the length to be discover by LT is the improper length L, and also the
improper time T, respectively relatively to the proper length L0 or the proper time T0. The
role of the LT consists fundamentally of introducing the velocity v or deﬁning the improper
moving system (k relative to proper K or inversely). In all standard books we can ﬁnd

7Einstein’s spheres are not necessarily identical. Fock V. underlined about the scale factor: ”We have
c2τ 2
z2 ). The factor ϕ2, or rather ϕ, evidently characterises
the ratio of the scales of measurement in the primed and unprimed frames. Further, it follows that this
factor cannot depend on the relative velocity. It is usually said, following Einstein, that the scale factor
can ”evidently” depend on nothing but the relative velocity, and it is subsequently proved that, in fact, it
does not have any dependence but is equal to 1: ϕ(x, y, z, t) = 1.” [Pierseaux Y. (3), principe d’identit].
In Poincar´e’s relativistic kinematics the dependance of the scale factor on the velocity, l(ε), is paramount.
The group property of LT proves that the velocity is a relative velocity.

1L0. Therefore the improper time and the improper length
contraction of proper length γ−
(in the moving system) are inversely proportional. Let us examine Einstein’s use of LT
(the standard deduction) in details.

(ξ1 = ξ2 = ξ) in k. We ﬁnd the duration T in K by the second LT:

τ 1, is the duration between this two events at the same place

−

The duration, T = t2

t1, in the moving system K is

t1 = γ(τ 1

v
c2 ξ)

−

−

T = γT0

t2 = γ(τ 2

v
c2 ξ)

−

(30)

(31)

With the ﬁrst LT we remark that the two considered events are not at the same place

in K

x1 = γ(ξ

vτ 1)

−

x2 = γ(ξ

vτ 2)

−

This is a very well known result: Einstein(-Poincar´e’s, see conclusion) dilation is the
consequence of the fact that we must use two clocks in diﬀerent places (∆x = vT0 ) of the
moving system.

4.2.2 CONTRACTION OF PROPER LENGTH
ξ1 is
According to Einstein (as in all standard books on SR), the proper length L0 = ξ2 −
the length at rest in k (ξ2, ξ1 are the coordinates of the ends of the rods in k). The length
of the moving rod is then deﬁned as the distance between the two ends of the rod at the
same time (t = t1 = t2) in K. We immediately ﬁnd this length, L = x2
x1, by the inverse
ﬁrst LT

−

ξ1 = γ(x1 + vt)

ξ2 = γ(x2 + vt)

and therefore we obtain Einstein’s famous contraction:

L = γ−

1L0

(32)

Both Einstein’s deductions, dilation of time and contraction of length, are presented in
all standards books as perfectly symmetric: two events at the same place (in k) for the
dilation of duration and two events at the same time (in K) for the contraction length.
Nevertheless: what are the complete coordinates of the two events (ends of the rods) in
the proper system k? In order to have the complete symmetry, we must consider the other
LT not only in the case of dilation of duration (31) but also in the case of contraction of
length. The second LT is:

τ 1 = γ(t +

v
c2 x1)

τ 2 = γ(t +

v
c2 x2)

(33)

10

This is a completely ignored result. The second LT determines obviously the times, τ 1
and τ 2, of the ends of the rods ξ1and ξ2 in the proper system k and thus the complete
coordinates of the two events (ξ1, τ 1) and (ξ2,τ 2): the simultaneous events in k are, obvi-
ously by LT, not simultaneous events (∆τ = v
c2 L0 ) in k. This is in contradiction with
Einstein’s deﬁnition of identical RIGID rods (see above Deﬁnition 1 in 4-1) that implies
that the proper length must be deﬁned by simultaneous events in the proper system (the
ends of the rigid rods are deﬁned at the same time τ ). So Einstein’s contraction is
not deduced directly from LT: it is a supplementary hypotheses (this is not the case in
Poincar´e’s kinematics, see conclusion).

Deﬁnition 2 The proper length L0 is deﬁned by two simultaneous events (ξ1, τ ) and (ξ2,
τ ) in k (deﬁnition 1) and the improper length is deﬁned by two simultaneous events (x1, t)
and (x2, t) in K. But these events are not the images by LT one another.

Einstein’s inverse (γ−

1) contraction (32) or ”Einstein’s breaking of symmetry” is there-
fore clearly in opposition with Poincar´e’s direct proportionality of the transformation of
time and length in the moving system (see conclusion)

5 Conclusion: Deﬁnition of space-time Units in

Poincar´e’s Relativistic Kinematics.

Poincar´e writes in 1911 in ”L’espace et le temps” on the special theory of relativity:

Today some physicists want to adopt a new convention. This is not that
they have to do it; they consider that this convention is easier, that’s all; and
those who have another opinion may legitimately keep the old assumption in
order not to disturb their old habits.[Poincar´e H. 1912)]

”Some physicists” is a clear allusion to Einstein and Minkowski. What is the diﬀerence,
according to Poincar´e, between the ”old convention” and the ”new convention”? Let us
examine Poincar´e’s old (tacit) assumption in detail. What happens if we place another
source in the second system K in Poincar´e’s relativistic kinematics? Suppose that the
relativistic ether is by deﬁnition at rest (spheres around O’) relative to the ﬁrst source in
K’. Poincar´e’s relativistic ether is then moving relative to the second source at O in K
and so we rediscover the second case with an ellipsoidal wave in the system of the source.
And reciprocally, with inverse LT, the role of the ether (the criterion of relativistic rest)
is inverted. Logically in Poincar´e’s SR, with one source or two sources, we always have a
sphere in one system and an ellipsoid in the other system and never two spheres in the
two systems (paragraph 4).

If historically Poincar´e deduced directly the ellipsoid from the contraction of unit, we
must now deduce the contraction of unit from the ellipsoid directly provided by the LT.
From the main property of an elongated ellipse r+ + r− = 2kr′ (see ﬁgure 2 the forth
distance r+ and the back distance r− with respect to the second focus F∗ or the forth travel

11

time t+ and the back travel time t− with respect to the second focus F ∗)8 where M means
”mean (average)”, ”round trip” or ”two ways”, we obtain:

rM =

= kr′

tM =

= kt′

(34)

r+ + r−
2

t+ + t−
2

We have by deﬁnition in the system K’ t′ = 1t′ and r′ = 1r′ (the choice of only one
length unit). So if the elongated ellipse is an alternative deﬁnition of the units we must be
able to deduce immediately Poincar´e’s ”round trip” units in K. Indeed we have:

1r = k1r′

1t = k1t′

(35)

The unit of local time (”elliptical time”) 1t is always dilated in relation with the unit

of true time (”circular time”) 1t′.

For the unit of space, we must ﬁrst show that there is no transversal contraction (19):

with θ′ = π

2 , we have sin θ = k−

1 and thus

1y = 1r sin θ et 1y′ = 1r′ sin θ′

(36)

(37)

1y = 1y′

1x = k1x′

We immediately have for the longitudinal component cos θ = cos θ′ = 1, with r+ = k(1 + ε)
and r− = k(1

ε)

−

Let us call 1x′ ”the unit at (relativistic) rest” and 1x ”the unit in (relativistic) moving”.
So the unit at rest 1x′ is seen purely longitudinally elongated (by a factor k) by the observer
O in moving in K. This is an unusual language but if we inverse the situation (if A > B
=

B < A) we then have

⇒

11x

1x′ = k−

The unit 1x in moving is seen longitudinally contracted (by a factor k−

(38)
1) from the
observer at rest O’. This is a more usual language9. We rediscover therefore the initial
postulate of Poincar´e about the contraction of a moving unit (see historical introduction).
We underline that Poincar´e’s deduction of dilated units is based, and only based, on the
application of LT (the ”old convention”). He doesn’t need like Einstein a supplementary
hypotheses (see paragraph 4). Einstein-Minkowski’s deﬁnition of identical units within
both systems is clearly beyond the LT (the ”new convention”, see paragraph 4). At the
end of the deduction of his elongated ellipse Poincar´e writes:

8Poincar´e’s exact synchronisation (at the second order) is developped with Poincar´e’s elongated el-
= t−) is Poincar´e’s convention of

lipsoid in [Pierseaux Y. (1)] (1999). Poincar´e’s elongated ellipse (t+
synchronisation.

9In Einstein’s relativistic logic A > B has no meaning because there are identical rigids rods (A=B)
In Poincar´e’s relativistic logic it is
within the two systems (see deﬁnitions 1 and 2 in paragraph 4).
completely equivalent to say ”the image of the unit at rest is always elongated” and ”the image of an unit
in moving is always contracted”.

This hypothesis of Lorentz and FitzGerald will appear most extraordinary
at ﬁrst sight. All that can be said in its favour for the moment is that it is
merely the immediate interpretation of Michelson experimental result, if we
deﬁne (in italics in the text) distances by the time taken by light to traverse
them.[Poincar´e H. (1908)]

So with the ellipse we see immediately that the time of the round trip is the same in all
directions (and therefore for the two Michelson’s perpendicular directions). So Poincar´e’s
historical ellipse is the immediate interpretation of Michelson’s null result10 without pos-
tulating that the source in the system (proper) of the Earth emits spherical waves.

And this is not all: according to Poincar´e the distances are deﬁned by the dilated time
taken by light to traverse them. We can deduce this fundamental point directly from LT.
The usual deﬁnition of the length of a rod implies that we consider at the same time the
two ends of the rod. So we consider the two ends of the unit of length 1x′ in K’ at the same
time t′ = 0 (the primed coordinates are 0, 0 and 1, 0). What is the length of the rod in
the other system K (the moving system) according to Poincar´e, i.e. according to LT? The
calculation with (5) gives immediately 1x = k1x′. The elongation of the stationary rod is
a direct consequence of the fact that two simultaneous events in K’ are not simultaneous
events in K (see paragraph 4) .

We conclude by remarking that Poincar´e’s relativistic kinematics is based on a funda-
mental space-time proportionality (a dilation by a factor k) in perfect harmony with the
invariance of the speed of light.

(39)

Poincar´e’s direct space-time proportionality (very strange in Einstein’s kinemat-
ics11, see paragraph 4, (29, 30)) characterizes fundamental Poincar´e’s choice of space-time
units in relativistic kinematics I shall choose the units of length and of time in such a way
that the velocity of light is equal to unity (λ′ν′ = λν = c = 1). This is the reason why
we kept Poincar´e’s notations ε (β) and k (γ): behind Poincar´e’s notations, there is not
only Poincar´e’s perfectly symmetrical representation of LT (5) but also Poincar´e’s ”old
convention” about the metric (in the sense of space-time units of measure) underlying the
invariance of quadratic form in SR.

The existence of a ”ﬁne structure” of SR (two very close but not merged theories) is

therefore demonstrated [Pierseaux Y. (1)].

According to Minkowski (1908), Einstein’s SR was not a local theory but a theory
of ”the world” or ” the Universe” (worldline, worldpoint, worldinterval and even world
principle, which is Minkowski’s name for the principle of relativity [Minkowski H.]).

10And also an immediate explanation of Sagnac non null result (1913). According to Selleri one of the
main problems of rotating platform with Einstein’s kinematics is precisely Einstein’s invariance of one way
speed of light, t+ = t−, in the proper system [F. Selleri]. In Poincar´e’s relativistic kinematics we can have
= t− (see ﬁgure 2). With Poincar´e’s elongated ellipse [Pierseaux Y. (1)]
in the system of the source t+
and Poincar´e’s group with rotations [Reignier J.], we predict immediately (at the second order k) the
experimentally measured diﬀerence of time t+−t−
2 = kεL (L = 2πR, R being the radius of the platform).
11In Einstein’s kinematics, the image by (30 & 32 ) of a purely longitudinal light clock in the proper
system implies that the velocity of light in the moving system is γ2c. This is perhaps the reason why we
ﬁnd, in Einstein’s texts only the purely transversal light clocks (without contraction) !

The problem is that Minkowski’s metric is incompatible with an expansion of the Uni-
verse (Hubble 1929). Finally we point out that Poincar´e’s metric
involves not only a
dilation of time but also an expansion of space. We will show in another paper that
Poincar´e’s completely relativistic expansion is directly connected with the deduction of the
relativistic Doppler formulae from Poincar´e’s ellipse.

6 Annex: Penrose’s and Poincar´e’s elongated ellip-

soid

The question under discussion is directly connected to another question: Penrose-Terrel’s
analysis on ”The Apparent Shape of a Relativistic Moving Sphere” (1959) or ”The Invisi-
bility of Lorentz Contraction” (1959) in Einstein’s SR. If we search the apparent shape for
one observer of a moving material sphere, according to Penrose [Penrose R.], we have to
send a signal of light that is reﬂected on the surface of the sphere and that ﬁnally returns to
the observer. Penrose shows that we have to take into account Einstein’s 1905 relativistic
formulae of aberration and Doppler eﬀect. Terrel writes thus:

The factor M is the magniﬁcation, the ratio between subtended angles as
seen by the observers O’ and O, or the ratio of apparent distances of the objects
from the two observers. It is interesting that M is precisely the Doppler shift
factor becoming q

for θ = 0 = θ′. [Terrel J.]

In one dimension we avoid the question of aberration (for θ = 0 = θ′), which is the
main problem of Penrose-Terrel and not under discussion in the present paper. If we try

to measure a moving contracted rod L = γ−

The length of the image of the sphere in the direction of motion is thus
greater than might otherwise be expected so that if it were not for the ﬂattening
the sphere would appear to be elongated. [Penrose R.]

And also Rindler:

This shows that a moving sphere presents a circular outline to all observers
in spite of length contraction (or rather: because of length contraction; for
without length contraction the outline would be distorted). [Rindler W.]

So according to Lampa-Penrose-Terrel the image of the rigid rod is, by compensation
1L0 =
with Einstein’s contraction, a rigid rod. This enigmatic compensation, Lapp = γγ−
L0, might be true (the image of a sphere, not by LT but ”by Doppler and aberration”, would

be a sphere but only for ”suﬃciently small subtended solid angle” [Terrel J., Weisskopf V. (2)]).
However it is clear that Einstein’s convention is diﬀerent to Poincar´e’s one: in Poincar´e’s
SR the elongated light ellipsoid appears because of the contraction of unit of length (see
conclusion) whilst in Einstein-Minkowski-Penrose’s SR the elongated material ellipsoid
disappears because of Einstein’s contraction. Let us remark that in this scientiﬁc tradition
(the relativistic shape of a sphere of matter), which begins in 1924 with Lampa, nobody
made the slightest reference to Poincar´e’s 1906 elongated ellipse (the relativistic shape of
a sphere of light).

We develop a systematic approach to calculating the electrostatic force between point charges
in an arbitrary geometry with arbitrary boundary conditions. When the boundary is present,
the simple expression for the force acting on a charge as “the charge times the ﬁeld it is placed
in” becomes ill-deﬁned. However, this rule can be salvaged if the ﬁeld in question is redeﬁned to
include all the terms that do not diverge at the charge position, in particular, those due to the
charge itself. The proof requires handling the self-action energy divergence for point charges,
which is accomplished by means of a geometrical regularization.

ularization

I.

INTRODUCTION

It is trivial to determine the force exerted by an exter-
nal ﬁeld 1 on a point charge in an otherwise empty space:
by deﬁnition, “the force is equal to the charge times the
ﬁeld it is placed in”. In particular, if the ﬁeld in question
is created by some other point charges, this rule, known
by many from high school, still holds.

However, the situation changes drastically when a set
of point charges creates the ﬁeld inside an arbitrary do-
main with a boundary of some physical origin (reﬂected
in the appropriate boundary conditions). Now the very
notion of “the ﬁeld the charge is placed in” becomes not
well deﬁned. For example, a naive treatment of a single–
charge problem might lead one to an entirely wrong con-
clusion that, since all the ﬁeld in the problem is due to
the charge itself (there are no other sources!), “the ﬁeld
it is placed in” is zero, so there is no force at all.

A slightly more sophisticated physicist would argue
that only the part of the ﬁeld which diverges as 1/r2
near the charge is really created by it, while the rest is
due to the boundary conditions, which represent math-
ematically the rearrangement of other physical charges
at the boundary. Therefore it is precisely what remains
after subtracting the singular part that now gives “the
ﬁeld the charge is placed in”. Unfortunately, such treat-
ment leaves one in a somewhat awkward position of, ﬁrst,
calculating potentials and ﬁelds rigorously, and then low-

1In fact, the word “external” in any case means that the sources
of the ﬁeld, such as some boundaries, are far away from the charge.

ering the plank and using hand-waving arguments to de-
rive forces from them. It is also not clear whether the
guess about which part of the total ﬁeld contributes to
the force is always valid.

Thus it seems appealing to show that the physical
arguments can be backed by an accurate mathematical
proof demonstrating that the adjusted rule, “the force is
equal to the charge times the part of the ﬁeld that does
not diverge at the charge’s location”, is either universal
or limited by certain conditions. To do this, one should
turn to the most fundamental energy conservation argu-
ment which gives the force as the negative gradient of
the energy in the charge’s position. This approach also
does not turn out to be straightforward, since the energy
is inﬁnite in the presence of point charges due to their
self–action.

Perhaps because of these diﬃculties, as well as of a
misleading apparent simplicity of the problem, our liter-
ature search, which encompassed, in particular, Refs. 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and many other books on the sub-
ject, revealed no ready result (except for one small piece
in Ref. 6 which we discuss in Sec. IV). So we give a care-
ful derivation of the general expression for the force on
point charges in this paper. It consists of a regularization
of the problem, calculation of the force from the (regu-
larized and ﬁnite) energy, and then taking the singular
limit. The result agrees with one’s intuitive expectations.

II. ELECTROSTATICS PROBLEM WITH

VOLUME POINT CHARGES: POTENTIAL
AND ENERGY

Consider an arbitrary 3-dimensional domain D with
the perfectly conducting boundary S and some N point
electrical charges inside. The electrical potential, ψ(r), in
this case is determined by the following Dirichlet bound-

ary value problem (we use SI units throughout the pa-
per):

force is given by (cf. Ref. 6) 3

Here r = xex + yey + zez is the vector radius of a point,
and ri = xiex + yiey + ziez speciﬁes the ith charge po-
sition, with eα, α = x, y, z, being the unit vectors in the
direction of the corresponding Cartesian axes.

By superposition principle, the potential ψ(r) is just
the sum of the potentials induced by each charge sepa-
rately,

where κ = 1/4πε0, and GR(r, rj ) is the regular part of the
Green’s function G(r, rj ) of the corresponding boundary
value problem [set qj = 1, qi = 0, i 6= j in Eq. (1)]. Both
functions are, of course, symmetric in their arguments,

G(r, rj ) = G(rj , r),

GR(r, rj ) = GR(rj, r).

Furthermore, we can rewrite Eq. (4) splitting the poten-
tial in a sum of its singular and regular parts,

ψ(r) = κ

where ψR(r) is a regular function satisfying the Laplace
equation everywhere in D [by continuity, this holds also
at any regular point 2 of the boundary S, although this is
irrelevant to our discussion]. Note that both the poten-
tial, ψ, and its regular part, ψR, depend actually on the
positions of the charges ri as well as on the observation
point r, which is reﬂected in the full notation,

ψ(r) ≡ ψ(r, r1, . . . , ri, . . . , rN ),
ψR(r) ≡ ψR(r, r1, . . . , ri, . . . , rN ).

Note that we alternatively write ∇ or ∂/∂r for the gra-
dient, whatever seems proper in a particular expression.
The problem is, however, that the above integral obvi-
ously diverges due to self-interaction of the point charges
(the energy of a single point charge is inﬁnite). We are
going to show that even though the energy for a given
point charge distribution is inﬁnite, the diﬀerence be-
tween its two values corresponding to two diﬀerent but
close charge conﬁgurations is ﬁnite for any charge con-
ﬁguration and boundary shape, and the force is also ﬁnite
due to that, in accordance with common intuition.

III. REGULARIZED ENERGY AND THE

FORCE ON THE CHARGES

We surround each volume charge qi by a small sphere
Sǫ
i of radius ǫ; we write Dǫ
i for the ball inside it. We deﬁne
i , and Sǫ as a union of S
Dǫ as D without all domains Dǫ
and all spherical surfaces Sǫ
i (see Fig. 1). In eﬀect, Sǫ is
the boundary of Dǫ.

Using Eq. (10), we may now deﬁne the force acting on

the charge qi as

2We allow for the boundary singularities, such as sharp edges
and spikes, provided that the Meixner type ﬁnite energy condi-
tion [11] is satisﬁed near them; in particular, the domain D can be
inﬁnite.

3It is important to understand that Eq. (10) is a deﬁnition of
a mathematical object that we would like to correspond to the
physical force. If there are no external ﬁelds [Eq. (2) ensures this
in our discussion], it will turn out that the conclusions derived from
Eq. (10) are physically meaningful and validate the deﬁnition.

order of operations in Eq. (12): ﬁrst take the gradient of
the regularized energy in the charge position, then take
the (singular) limit. In principle, we also have to show
that the ﬁnal result does not depend on the regularization
chosen, but this task is not easy. We will return to it
brieﬂy later in this paper.

In view of Eq. (11) and the fact that the total po-
tential given by Eq. (3) or Eq. (6) is regular in Dǫ, the
regularized energy is

n is the direction of the outward normal to Sǫ (and thus
the inward normal to the spheres Sǫ

domain D it is assumed here that the potential and its
gradient drop at inﬁnity fast enough to make the con-
tribution of integrating over the sphere of a large radius
vanishing in the limit, which assumption has to be veri-

ﬁed in each particular case.

Since ψ is harmonic everywhere in Dǫ, the volume in-
tegral on the right of the previous equality vanishes; the
remaining surface one is represented as

We are ultimately interested in the limit ǫ → 0, so we
need to calculate only the quantities which do not vanish
in this limit. The area of integration in each term of the
above sum is O(ǫ2), therefore we need to keep track of
the integrands that grow at least quadratically in ǫ−1.
Bearing this in mind and using Eq. (6) for the potential,
we can write the surface integral in Eq. (16) as

The ﬁrst term in the above expression is, in fact, a reg-

(18)

The only feature of the regularized self–energy given by
Eq. (18) important for our derivation is that it does not

depend on the position of the charge qk, i. e., on the
vector radius rk.

The second term of the r. h. s. of Eq. (17) can also
be simpliﬁed if one notices that both ψR and 1/|r − rj|,
j 6= k, are regular on Sǫ
k. Therefore their
change within the small surface Sǫ
k is of order ǫ. Thus
Eq. (17) may be rewritten as

and the integration here yielding the factor 4π is again an elementary one. This asymptotic equality may be diﬀer-

Equation (20), in its turn, is inserted in the Eq. (12) for the force; as shown, the self–energies do not depend on
the charge positions, hence, although diverging in the limit ǫ → 0, they do not contribute to the force. The rest

is pretty straightforward, except one has to be careful when diﬀerentiating the last term on the right of Eq. (20)
with k = i: as seen from Eq. (8), in this case ri stands for two (and not one!) arguments of ψR, namely, ψR(ri) ≡
ψR(ri, r1, . . . , ri, . . . , rN ), and both of them have to be diﬀerentiated. Bearing this in mind, the expression for the
force ﬁnally becomes:

Note that the last expression, indeed, coincides with our
intuitive guess for the form of the force.

IV. DISCUSSION

Our ﬁrst remark on the expressions for the force in
Eqs. (21)–(23) is that for the charges in a free space (vol-
ume D is the whole space, no boundaries present) appar-
ently GR(r, rk) ≡ 0, ψR ≡ 0, and the classical Coulomb
formula for the force is restored.

Next, Eq. (23) shows that the rule “the force is the
charge times the ﬁeld it is placed in” does work if one
counts the regular part of the ﬁeld produced by the charge
in question as a part of the “ﬁeld the charge is placed in”.
It also makes up to some “minimal principle”, namely:
to get the right answer for the force, one should throw
out of the ﬁeld only the part which otherwise makes the
result inﬁnite, and nothing beyond that. As we mentioned
in the Introduction, this result is supported by physical
intuition. It becomes even more transparent if one notes
that the singular part of the ﬁeld thrown out is radial,
and the radial ﬁeld produces no force.

A contribution of the regular part of the ﬁeld created
by a charge to the force acting on it is especially impor-
tant in the case of a single charge, as one may see from
the simplest example of a charge near a conducting plane.

It is exactly the regular part of the ﬁeld produced by the
charge in question (equal to the ﬁeld of the image charge)
that gives the whole answer when no other charges are
present.

Finally, an important question is how robust our regu-
larization of the problem is, i. e., whether the result for
the force does not change if one uses a diﬀerent regular-
ization. There are two signiﬁcant points demonstrating
such robustness.

The ﬁrst one is concerned with the geometrical regular-
ization that we used. If one chooses domain Dǫ
k around
qk to be not a ball but some diﬀerently shaped volume
bounded by smooth surface Sǫ
k (“topological ball”), then
it is not diﬃcult to see that all the terms of order O(ǫ)
in Eq. (20) for the regularized energy remain unchanged,
and hence our result for the force is still true. The demon-
stration goes exactly in the same way as above, only
the computation of the integral over the surface Sǫ
k in
Eq. (19) requires a well–known result from potential the-
ory (cf. Ref. 12). As for the ﬁrst integral on the right of
Eq. (17), which deﬁnes the self–energy W ǫ
k, self , its ex-
plicit expression is not even needed, and its only relevant
property, namely, its independence of rk, is obvious.

An alternative way of regularization, so widely used by
the classics during the whole “pre-Dirac delta-function”
era, is the physical regularization, when the point charge
qk is replaced, within the small volume Dǫ
k, with some

k(r) and the
smooth charge distribution of the density ρǫ
same total charge qk, and ǫ is taken to zero in the answer.
From the technical point of view, this approach proves
to be more complicated in this particular case, but it
leads again to the same O(ǫ) terms in Eq. (20) for the
regularized energy. The key point here is to start with
the following expression for the regularized energy,

W ǫ

and then, instead of Eq. (3), split the potential into a sum
of volume potentials of ρǫ
k (which becomes sin-
R(r). In par-
gular in the limit), and a regular addition ψǫ
ticular, this regularization is used by Smythe in Sec. 3.08
of Ref. 6 for calculating the force on a single point charge
in a domain with the zero potential at the boundary. The
derivation there is at the ‘physical level of accuracy’, and
the answer is not brought down to its physically most rel-
evant form of Eq. (23). Moreover, the ﬁnal answer there
[r. h. s. of Eq. (2) in that Section] is, unfortunately, for-
mally diverging, because of the inappropriate use of the
notation for the total potential in place where its regular
part should be.

Finally, we want to end our discussion by noticing that
the electrostatic problem we just solved, as well as its gen-
eralizations (see Sec. V), involve only volume charges. On
the other hand, magnetostatic problems that deal, for ex-
ample, with magnetic ﬂuxes trapped in superconducting
media (cf. Ref. 13) give rise to surface charges. Analysis
of these is of extreme importance for today’s experimen-
tal physics [14]. No easy solution for the force between
surface charges should be anticipated since the details of
the boundary shape, such as its curvature, are expected
to play a role; the interaction of such surface charges will
be discussed elsewhere.

V. GENERALIZATION: OTHER BOUNDARY

CONDITIONS

We can now generalize our result for other conditions
at the boundary. A modest but potentially useful gener-
alization is to the case of electrodes, when an arbitrary
distribution of the potential, V (r), and not just a zero,
is speciﬁed at the boundary:

ψ

= V (r),

r ∈ S .

(25)

and

Let us split the potential in two,

S
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

of which the ﬁrst is caused by point charges without any
voltage applied to the boundary, and the second is en-
tirely due to the boundary voltage. Therefore ψ(1) satis-
ﬁes the boundary value problem of Eqs. (1) and (2),

given according to Eq. (23),

result for the force [Eq. (23)] without any new technical
diﬃculties. Indeed, we split the total potential in two as

charges ﬁeld from ψ(2) produces the force of Eq. (31), so
by superposition the total force is again as in Eq. (23)
[or Eq. (32)].

The appropriate split of the potential in two parts
[Eq. (26)] is a little bit trickier for the Neumann bound-

Namely, the solvability criterion (the total charge must
be zero) makes us, when splitting the potential, to add
and subtract another charge Q (equal to the sum of the
point charges qi) at some point r∗ of the domain D, to

with both problems solvable. Again, the derivation of
the force from ψ(1) satisfying the homogeneous boundary
condition goes exactly as before and leads to Eq. (29), the
external to the charges ﬁeld ψ(2) exerts the force given
in Eq. (31), and by superposition the result of Eq. (23)
holds. The problem itself, though, is not too realistic,
except for the case of an insulated boundary, σ(r) ≡ 0.

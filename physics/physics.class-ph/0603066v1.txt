An introductory exposition of Chandrasekhar’s gravitational dynamical friction, appropriate for
an undergraduate class in mechanics, is presented. This friction results when a massive particle
moving through a “sea” of much lighter star particles experiences a retarding force du to an ex-
change of energy and momentum. General features of dynamical friction are presented, both in an
elementary and in a more elaborate way using hyperbolic two-body interactions. The orbital decay
of a massive particle in an homogeneous gravitational system is solved analytically, that leads to
an underdamped harmonic oscillator type of motion. A numerical integration of the equation of
motion in a more realistic case is done. These results are compared to those of an N -body computer
simulation. Several problems and projects are suggested to students for further study.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Classical mechanics, perhaps the oldest of the phys-
ical sciences, continues to be an area of intensive re-
search, both in its foundations1,2 and applications,3,4 and
a source of discussion and examples in teaching. Ap-
plications range from the modeling of cellular mechan-
ical processes5 to solar system dynamics3 and galactic
systems.6,7,8

In describing nature students learn from their ﬁrst
courses, and particularly in laboratory experiments, that
“the forces on a single thing already involve approxima-
tion, and if we have a system of discourse about the real
world, then that system, at least for the present day, must
involve approximations of some kind”; as mentioned by
Feynman on introducing the subject of friction.9

This phenomenon is usually introduced in text-
books10,11,12,13 and lectures by considering the slide of
a material block on a surface, and a distinction between
static and kinetic friction is made. A classical example of
the eﬀect of a friction-like force is the motion of a mass
attached to a spring inside a viscous medium, where the
corresponding diﬀerential equation is solved, and its be-
havior studied. At the end, one invariably needs to state
that friction and its origin is a complicated matter, in-
volving complex interactions at the atomic and molecular
level among the surfaces in contact.14,15,16,17

Several non-typical examples of mechanical friction for
introductory courses exist,18,19,20,21 that help both teach-
ers and students alike in lectures on mechanics. All fric-
tion related problems are a background for discussing the
important connection between the work-energy theorem
and dissipative systems.22,23,24

The purpose of this paper is to bring an example from
astronomy25,26,27 closely related to standard mechani-
cal friction, namely: dynamical friction. This process
was ﬁrst introduced in stellar systems by Subrahmanyan
Chandrasekhar.28,29 In brief, a massive particle m experi-
ences a drag force when moving in a “sea” of much lighter
star particles m∗ by exchanging energy and momentum.

An elementary understanding requires only some basic
ideas from mechanics, and hence suitable for presenta-
tion in introductory courses.

Dynamical friction is important in astronomical stud-
ies of, for example: the fate of galaxy satellites30,31,32 or
globular clusters33 orbiting their host galaxies, the sub-
structure of dark halos surrounding galaxies,34,35,36 and
the motion of black holes in the centers of galaxies.37
It has been proposed to explain the formation of bina-
ries in the Kuiper-belt38, and the migration of Jupiter-
mass planets in other solar systems from the outer parts
> 1 AU) to the small or-
where they presumably formed (
< 0.1 AU) at which they are observed.39
∼
bital distances (

It even has been considered in the motion of cosmic
strings.40

The presentation of this topic to students, in a lower
or upper-undergraduate class on mechanics41,42 or com-
putational physics,43 will enhance their appreciation of
physics in describing nature and expose them to another
example of classical mechanics. Furthermore, students
will obtain a glimpse of an area of astronomical research
important for the understanding of the fate and behavior
of stellar systems.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In Sec-
tion II basic elements of the theory of dynamical friction
are presented. Firstly, elementary arguments are used
to elucidate them. Secondly, Chandrasekhar’s approxi-
mation using two-body hyperbolic Keplerian collisions is
considered. In Section III a simple analytical problem for
the motion of a massive particle in an ideal homogeneous
stellar system is solved; a damped harmonic oscillator is
found. In Section IV a more realistic astronomical exam-
ple that requires the numerical integration of the equa-
tion of motion is presented. Comparison with a computer
experiment is done afterwards. Final comments as well
as some ideas for problems and projects of further study
are provided in Section IV. An appendix contains some
astronomical units and standard units used in gravita-
tional computer simulations.

II. DYNAMICAL FRICTION

Two equivalent approaches to compute the dynami-
cal friction a massive particle m experiences as it moves
through a stellar system of much lighter stars m∗ are the
following.6 (1) Particle m produces a region of star over-
density behind it, much like the wake behind the motion
of a ship, that in turn exerts a gravitational pull on m
leading to its deceleration.44 (2) Particle m moves in the
“sea” of lighter particles m∗ and an energy exchange oc-
curs, increasing that of the lighter ones at the expense of
the heavy one leading to a breaking force for m. In the
latter picture the basic features of dynamical friction are
easier to compute and understand by elementary meth-
ods. Here the latter picture is taken.

A. Elementary estimate

Consider a particle m moving with velocity vm in an
homogeneous background of stationary lighter particles
of equal mass m∗; see Figure 1. Assume only changes
in kinetic energy. As m moves through, a particle m∗
incoming with impact parameter b will be given a velocity
impulse of about the acceleration a times the duration of
the encounter ∆t. This can be approximated as

∆v∗ ≈

Gm
b2 ×

b
vm

.

(2)

The kinetic energy gain of m∗ is therefore

.

The total change in velocity of the massive particle is
given by accounting for all the encounters it suﬀers with
particles m∗. The number of encounters with impact pa-
n0 (vm∆t) ∆(πb2);
rameter between b and b+∆b is ∆N
where n0 is the number density of background stars. The
total change in velocity of m at the expense of the energy
lost by stars is then

where we set ρ0 = n0m∗, the background density, and
bmin and bmax are a minimum and maximum impact pa-
rameter, respectively. Letting ln Λ be the resulting inte-
gral, the deceleration of m due to its interaction with an
homogenous background of particles stars is

dvm
dt ≈

ln Λ .

The velocity impulse on m∗ has a perpendicular ∆v⊥
and parallel ∆v|| component; see Figure 1. It is not diﬃ-
cult to see that a mean vector sum of all the ∆v⊥ contri-
butions vanishes in this case. This is not true however for
the mean square of ∆v⊥.61 Thus the dynamical friction
force is along the line of motion of m.

Several key features of dynamical friction are observed
from equation (4) in this elementary calculation, that
appear also in more elaborate treatments. (1) The de-
celeration of the massive particle is proportional to its
mass m, so the frictional force it experiences is directly
proportional to m2. (2) The deceleration is inversely pro-
portional to the square of its velocity vm.

B. Chandrasekhar formula

A further step in calculating the eﬀect of dynamical
friction is to consider hyperbolic Keplerian two-body en-
counters. Such analysis was done by Chandrasekhar.28,29
The resulting formula is provided in textbooks on stel-
lar dynamics.6 For completeness such calculations is pro-
vided here, following Binney & Tremaine.

Use of well known results from the Kepler problem for
two bodies in hyperbolic encounters are used.10,11,12,13,45
The two-body problem can be reduced to that of the
motion of a particle of reduced mass µ = mm∗/(m + m∗)
about a ﬁxed center of force:

µ¨r =

κ
r2 ˆr ,
−
where κ = Gmm∗, r = r∗ −
rm is the relative vector
position of particles m and m∗, and ˆr its unit vector; see
vm, and
Figure 2. The relative velocity is then V = v∗ −
a change in it is

The velocity of the center-of-mass of m and m∗ does

not change, hence

∆V = ∆v∗ −

From equations (6) and (7) the change in velocity of m
is

Once ∆V is determined, ∆vm can be found from equa-

In a homogeneous sea of stellar masses all perpendicular
deﬂections cancel by symmetry. However, the parallel ve-
locity changes are added and the mass m will experience
a deceleration.

The calculation of the total drag force due to a set
of particles m∗ is as follows. Let f (v∗) be the number
density of stars. The rate at which particle m encounters
stars with impact parameter between b and b + db, and
velocities between v∗ and v∗ + dv∗, is

rameters from 0 to a bmax and then summing over all
velocities of stars. At a particular v∗ the change is

The quantity ln Λ is called the Coulomb logarithm in
analogy to an equivalent logarithm found in the theory of
plasma. The factor ln Λ reﬂects the fact that the cumu-
lative eﬀect of small deﬂections is more important than
strong or close encounters. This may be seen geometri-
cally from Figure 2, were the stronger the deﬂection the
smaller is the parallel component contributing to the slow
down of m.

The determination of the limits bmin and bmax is not
an easy matter and depends on the problem at hand. In
this approximation bmin satisﬁes V 2
0 = Gm/bmin, where
V0 depends on the relative velocity of m and m∗. If the
motion of m is relatively slow in comparison to that of

Putting these results together in equation (19):

the stars, V0 can be approximated for example by the
root-mean-square value velocity of stars Vrms. The outer
limit bmax is in principle the radius at which stars no
longer can exchange momentum with m.
If m is close
to the center of a stellar system bmax can be taken as a
particular scale-radius of the system; for example, where
the star density falls to half of its central value.

III. AN ANALYTICAL EXAMPLE

A simple application of Chandrasekhar’s formula (25)
for an homogeneous spherically symmetric stellar system,
although not inﬁnite, is presented. The problem consists
in determining the motion of a massive particle m subject
to gravitational and dynamical friction forces. The stellar
system has a radius R and total mass M ; see Figure 3.

To compare the numerical values of β and ω0 is better
to use another system of units than a physical one. Let

simulations in astronomy; to return to physical units one
can use Newton’s law and set G to the appropriate value

an upper limit to m is set when m = 3/5, leading to
ln Λ = 0; i.e., no dynamical friction results. For larger m
a negative β is obtained. Clearly, the model fails and the

A. Semi-analytic treatment

A simple representation of a stellar system, such as a

Equations (41) and (42) will be used in equation (25)
to compute the orbital motion of a massive particle m. It
rests to determine bmin and bmax. The former is evaluated
at local values, bmin = Gm/[3σ2(r)], and the latter is set
ﬁx to bmax = a.

The equation of motion (26) for m can now be inte-
grated numerically using standard methods,50,51 or using
the one discussed by Feynman9 for planetary orbits (
9).
§
Here a fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm with adap-
tive time-step was used. The initial conditions for m are
the same as those used in the analytical case.

In Figure 5 the resulting orbit from the numerical in-
tegration is shown as a dashed line. Also, the behavior of
the x and y coordinates, and of the distance r of m to the
center, as a function of time are shown. The typical de-
cay of the orbit is evident. In the same ﬁgure results from
an N -body simulation are displayed, that are described
next.

B. N-body simulation

The use of N -body simulations allows to study more
realistically the diﬀerent dynamical phenomena that oc-
cur in stellar systems.8,52 Several N -body codes with dif-
ferent degrees of sophistication have been developed for
astronomical problems in mind.53,54,55 Some low-N sim-
ulations can be run nowadays using a personal computer
with publicly available N -body codes.63

Barnes’ tree-code in Fortran, and some of his pub-
lic subroutines are used to simulate the motion of m
inside a Plummer model. A numerical realization of

FIG. 4: Orbital decay of a massive particle m in a homoge-
neous stellar system due to dynamical friction.
Initial con-
ditions are (x0, y0) = (0, 0.59) and (u0, v0) = (0.44, 0). Left
panels are for m = 0.01 and right ones for m = 0.02. Top
panels show the orbit (solid line) in the xy-plane and bottom
ones the time evolution of the distance r from the center. The
dynamical friction time scale τdf = 1/β is indicated by an ar-
row. Dashed lines are orbits without considering dynamical
friction.

Take as example m = 0.01. If the initial position of
m is at (x, y) = (0.59, 0.0) and its velocity (0.0, 0.44) the
resulting orbit is that shown in Figure 4-left with solid
line. Doubling m results in the orbit shown in Figure 4-
right. The dashed lines in correspond to the orbit of m
without dynamical friction. The eﬀect of increasing the
mass of m on the orbit, and on the decay time τdf , is
clearly appreciated.

This example shows the basic features of, for example,
the orbital decay of a satellite galaxy toward the cen-
ter of its host larger galaxy. It may be applied also to
the motion of a massive black hole near the center of a
galaxy or star cluster, where to some approximation the
gravitational potential can be taken as harmonic. More
realistic situations require however the numerical integra-
tion of the orbit and/or an N -body computer simulation.
A particular case of these are treated next.

IV. A MORE REALISTIC EXAMPLE

Chandrasekhar’s formula (25) although derived as-
suming an inﬁnite homogeneous system may be ap-
plied, to some degree, when stellar systems are non-
homogeneous.6 In this case, local values for the density
ρ(r) and the velocity dispersion σ(r) are used. Here the
motion of a massive particle m inside a non-homogeneous

7

Both approximations overestimate the decay rate of m
in comparison to the N -body simulation. Taking bmax =
a/5 leads to a somewhat better agreement, but does not
reproduce the N -body result. Rather surprisingly, the
analytical result does a fair job in reproducing the overall
orbital decay in this case.

V. FINAL COMMENTS

The approximations in deriving Chandrasekhar for-
mula limits, obviously, its application to more complex
stellar systems than the one considered here. However,
it is remarkable that equation (21) leads to reasonably
well results when used with values under a local approx-
imation.

In similar vain to the study of the friction between
surfaces,15,16,17 dynamical friction is a complex subject.
Elaborate calculations based on Brownian motion,56 lin-
ear response theory, resonances, and the ﬂuctuation-
dissipation theorem exist.30,57,58 These that are steps for-
ward toward a more complete physical theory for this
process.

Instead of listing explicitly some of the shortcomings
of Chandrasekhar dynamical friction formula6 when ap-
plied to gravitational systems, the student is encourage
to think on some of them and possible improvements on
such formula.

From the point of view of an introductory or interme-
diate class on mechanics the exposure of students to non-
typical problems, as the one presented here contributes
to further their understanding and appreciation of the
subject.

Some ideas that may lead to problems and/or projects

for students are:

1. How would the analytical solution considered here
would be changed if the Plummer model is used?
What type of approximations would be required to
make? How does ln Λ change?

2. If σ2 is a measure of the kinetic energy per unit
mass of stars, what is an estimate for its mean in-
crease due to the energy lost by the massive particle
during its decay?

3. How would the orbital decay time be changed for
diﬀerent types of initial eccentricities of the massive
particle?

4. Consider a star cluster (m = 106 M⊙) in circular
orbit at a distance of r = 5 kpc from the center of
1011M⊙, R
our galaxy (M
150 kpc). Would
it be expected to fall to the center within the age
of the universe, say t = 1010 yr? Typical velocities
for stars and dark matter particles at that distance
are about 200 km/s, and the scale-radius may be
around 5 kpc. What if instead of a star cluster
we have a galaxy satellite, such as the Magellanic

FIG. 5: N -body simulation of the orbital decay (solid line)
of a massive particle m inside a Plummer stellar model. The
semi-analytical (dashed line) and the analytical calculation
(dotted line) of Figure 4 are drawn for comparison. These
overestimate the eﬀect of dynamical friction in comparison to
the numerical simulation.

this model with N = 105 particles is used with indi-
vidual “star” masses of m∗ = 1/N . The massive particle
m = 1/100 with initial conditions (y0, ˙x0) = (0.59, 0.44)
is set “by hand” inside the numerical Plummer model.
In N -body units the scale radius is a = 3π/16 = 0.59
(see Appendix).

The circular period at radius r is τ = 2πr/Vc(r), where
the circular velocity and integrated mass for a Plummer
model are given, respectively, by:

Vc(r) =

GM (r)
r

,

r

M (r) =

M (r/a)
[1 + (r/a)2]3/2 .

From this, an orbital period of τa = 4.8 time units at
2τa
r = a results. The simulation was run for t = 10
time units. The parameters for running the tree-code
in serial were those provided by Barnes at his Internet
site for an isolated Plummer evolution. The quadrupole
moment in the gravitational potential is activated. The
simulation took about 5.2 cpu hours on a PC with an
Athlon 2.2GHz processor, and 512 KB of cache size. En-
ergy conservation was
0.04 percent, that is considered
very good.

Figure 5 shows the orbital evolution of the massive
particle m in the N -body system as a solid line. The
dashed line corresponds to the semi-analytical calculation
of Section IV A. This follows closely the orbit of m in the
N -body simulation for about τa time units. Afterwards,
it deviates from the N -body result. In the r-t panel, the
analytical solution (40) is shown as a dotted line; that is,
assuming the total system was homogeneous.

In this way the transformation from N -body units,
where G = M = R = 1, to physical ones can be made.

um, and the resulting units of uv and ut. The entries
correspond to using the approximate size and mass of a
globular cluster, a disk of a spiral galaxy, and of a cluster
of galaxies, respectively, as units ul and um.

5. How do results change if instead of a Plummer
model a more pronounced density proﬁle is used,
such as the Hernquist59 model? How does the num-
ber of particles N in a simulation aﬀect the decay
rate?

6. As the massive particle moves through the stellar
system it induces a density wake behind it. Can
this be detected in an N -body simulation on a home
computer? How about looking for this wake in the
phase-space diagram (e.g. a plot of ˙x–x) of stars
near the the massive particle?

7. How good do the local approximation works if in-
stead of a massive particle one has an extended
object, small in comparison to its host galaxy?

Textbook problems are designed in general to yield one
correct answer, the above ideas for problems are rather
vague but this is on purpose. The reason is twofold. On
one hand, to promote in students a spirit of research by
setting an approximate physical model and to look for the
required data and “tools” to solve it; some of them can
be found in the references. On the other hand, no single
deﬁnite answer can be given. A feature proper of the
way physics evolves toward describing and understanding
nature.

APPENDIX A: ASTRONOMICAL AND N-BODY
UNITS

Several quantities in astronomy are so large in compar-
ison to common “terrestial” values, that special units are
used. Table I lists some of these and their equivalences
in physical units.

In the mks system of units the Gravitational constant
10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2. A natural system
is G = 6.67
of units for gravitational interactions is that where the
gravitational constant is set to G = 1; in the same way
as for quantum systems Planck’s constant is usually set
to ¯h = 1. On dimensional grounds [G] = u2
vul/um; where
um, ul, and uv correspond, respectively, to units of mass,
length and velocity.

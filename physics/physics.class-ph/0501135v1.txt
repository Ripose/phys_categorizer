The Ascending Double-Cone
A Closer Look at a Familiar Demonstration

Abstract

The double-cone ascending an inclined V-rail is a common exhibit used for demon-
strating concepts related to center-of-mass in introductory physics courses [1]. While the
conceptual explanation is well-known—the widening of the ramp allows the center of mass
of the cone to drop, overbalancing the increase in altitude due to the inclination of the
ramp—there remains rich physical content waiting to be extracted through deeper explo-
ration. Such an investigations seems to be absent from the literature. This article seeks
to remedy the omission.

1 Introduction

The, familiar, double-cone demonstration is illustrated in ﬁgure 1 bellow. The set-up consists
of a ramp, inclined at an angle θ, composed of two rails forming a ‘V’ and each making an
angle φ with their bisector. A double-cone of angle 2ψ is placed upon the ramp. For certain
values of the angles θ, φ, and ψ, the double-cone will spontaneously roll upward.

Figure 1: A double cone that rolls up a V-shaped ramp. The ﬁgure shows the principal parameters, θ, φ, ψ,
determining the geometry of the demo. Also in the ﬁgure, are several quantities used in our study of the motion.
In particular, a is the radius of a cross-section taken at one of the contact points and perpendicularly to the
axis of the cone.

A qualitative description of the mechanism responsible for the phenomenon is easily given.
As the cone moves up the ramp and gains altitude ∆h, the distance between the rails increases
and the contact points move nearer the symmetry axis, thus reducing the elevation of the
center-of-mass (CM) relative to the ramp by an amount ∆H, which is determined by (but not
necessarily equal to) the change of radius ∆a resulting from the outward shifting of the contact
∆H, which may be positive,
points (ﬁgure 2). The net change of the CM height is thus ∆h
negative, or zero. When it is negative the cone rolls uphill since the eﬀect of the widening of
the ramp overbalances the increase in altitude.

Figure 2: The shifting of the contact points as the double-cone rolls uphill. The reader is cautioned. As shall
be explained, the contact points do not lie on the vertical plane that contains the symmetry axis of the cone;
instead with the symmetry axis of the cone, they deﬁne a plane that intersects the vertical plane at an angle.
See also ﬁgure 1.

Despite the above well-known and well-understood explanation for the motion of the double
cone, it seems—to the best of our knowledge—that no detailed, quantitative account has been
written. Our work seeks to remedy this omission.

Towards this goal we present some notation which will facilitate the discussions in the
following sections. As illustrated in the right side of ﬁgure 1 and ﬁgure 3, we shall denote
the left and right points of contact as CPL and CPR respectively, the half length of the cone
as L, the distance between the middle cross-section of the cone and the contact points as d,
and the distance from the axis of symmetry to the points of contact as a. Also, let P be the
point where the line deﬁned by the two contact points intersects the middle cross-section of
the cone and ~a be the vector that points from the center of mass (CM) of the cone to P . The
magnitude a of ~a is equal to the radius of the cross-section of the cone taken at the contact
points perpendicularly to the axis of the cone. When the cone is at the vertex of the ramp,
the two contact points coincide and a has a value of L tan ψ. Also, we shall denote by π
α
the angle the vector ~a makes with the unit normal vector ˆK to the ramp. All this is better
illustrated in ﬁgure 3.

2 Net Change of Height

To carry out our calculation we shall introduce two coordinate systems: First, a ﬁxed system,
which we shall call the ramp coordinate system XY Z, with origin at the vertex of the ramp, the
Y -axis along the bisector of the rails, the Z-axis perpendicular to the plane deﬁned by the rails

2

Figure 3: The circle represents part of the middle cross-section of the cone. (See right part of ﬁgure 1.) The
solid thick straight line is the intersection of the plane deﬁned by the two rails and a vertical plane perpendicular
to the axis of the cone.

and the X-axis parallel to the symmetry axis of the double-cone. We also adopt a CM-system
with axes parallel to those of the ramp system but whose origin is attached to the CM of the
double cone. The systems are shown in ﬁgure 4.

Figure 4: The ramp and CM systems.

Our experience with uniform spheres, discs, or cylinders rolling on an incline suggests that
a line drawn at a contact point perpendicularly to the incline on which the objects roll passes
through the CM (or the symmetry axis). Indeed, for these particular shapes, this is implied by
the fact that the incline must be tangent to the surface of the object at the contact point and
that the radii of a circle are normal to the circle. However, the conical shape on the V-shaped
ramp does not posses the same geometric property (although a double-cone rolling on two
parallel rails would). Consequently, the contact points, CPR and CPL, have a diﬀerent spatial

3

relation to the CM of the cone (ﬁgure 3).

Instead of working with the two points CPR, CPL, it is more convenient to work with the
point P deﬁned previously. Notice that all three points CPR, CPL, P have the same z and
y coordinates and only diﬀer in their x coordinates.
In fact, due to symmetry—we assume
the cone to be placed symmetrically between the rails so that there is no motion in the X-
direction—we are really dealing with a 2-dimensional problem.

To determine the angle α of ﬁgure 3, we must ﬁnd the y coordinate yP in the CM-frame.
This will give us the location of P relative to the CM of the cone. To this end, we write the
equation

3 A Dynamical Explanation

With our newfound knowledge regarding the way in which the double-cone sits on the ramp,
we are in a position to provide an account from a dynamical perspective.

Any solid placed on the ramp will contact it at two points. Since we assume that the solid
rolls without slipping, the contact points must be instantaneously at rest. The rigidity of the
solid then implies that all points lying on the line connecting the two contact points are also
at rest instantaneously, and, hence, this line deﬁnes the instantaneous axis of rotation. The
torque about this axis will solely be due to gravity since the frictional forces and the reaction
forces of the ramp are exerted at the axis.

The situation for a cylinder placed on the ramp is shown in ﬁgure 7. The angle between
the weight and the vector ~a, which enters the torque, is determined by the inclination θ of the
mga sin θ, always tends the cylinder to
ramp only. Thus the torque resultant of the weight,
roll down the ramp.

parameters φ and ψ. If α > θ, the resultant torque will tend the solid up the ramp. We can
thus see that it is the unusual way in which the double-cone sits on the ramp that distinguishes
it from the other solids and provides it the mechanism with which to roll up the ramp.

4 The Motion of the CM

Since Z is oriented perpendicular to the plane deﬁned by the rails and P lies on the ramp plane,
ZP is always zero. Thus ZCM is given by

(See ﬁgure 5.) If the point P has coordinate YP in the ramp-frame, then the half-distance
between the rails, d, must be given by

ZCM = a cos α .

d = YP tan φ ,

as is evident from ﬁgure 5. Using equations (6), (3), and (4), we write for a,

Hence,

a = L tan ψ

YP sin α .

ZCM = (L tan ψ

YP sin α) cos α .

−

(7)

Referring again to ﬁgure 5, we obtain

YCM = YP + a sin α = YCP + (L tan ψ

YCP sin α) sin α ,

or

Plugging this in to our previous result we obtain

YP =

YCM −

L tan ψ sin α

.

ZCM = λ YCM + b ,

(8)

(9)

where λ and b are constants determined by the geometry of the demo:

λ =

tan α ,

b = L tan ψ(cos α

tan α sin α) .

−

Equation (9) implies that the CM is constrained to move along a line on the zy-plane with
slope λ and intercept b.

This result is also made apparent through physical reasoning. The cone’s motion is that
of rigid rotation about the symmetry axis plus a translational motion of the CM with velocity
~vCM . Thus, the total velocity of the point P is ~vrot,P +~vCM , where ~vrot,P is its rotational velocity
about the symmetry axis. The rolling without slipping condition implies that the velocity of
the point P must be zero. Therefore

−

−

Since ~vrot,P must be perpendicular to ~a, we conclude that

~vCM =

~vrot,P .

−

~vCM ⊥
Since ~a is ﬁxed in direction and the velocity of the CM must always lie on the Y Z-plane (by
symmetry), the CM’s path is a line declined (inclined if α < θ) below the horizontal by an
angle α

θ (see ﬁgure 9).

~a .

5 Energy Analysis

As we have seen, the path of the CM is a straight line that makes an angle α with Y -axis as
shown in ﬁgure 9. We now introduce a new generalized coordinate: the distance along this
line, q. We shall take its zero to correspond to the position of the CM when the cone is at the
bottom of the ramp. In ﬁgure 9, ~a0 represents the value of ~a when the cone is at the bottom of
the ramp and d = 0. It can be seen that, in terms of q, YCM is given by

where Y 0
when q = 0. It is also clear from the ﬁgure that

For the potential energy, we are concerned with the vertical height of the CM; that is, we

obtained from the unprimed frame XY Z by rotating the latter by an angle θ about the X-axis
(see ﬁgure 9). From the ﬁgure we see that

Thus, we have for the potential

For the cone to roll up the ramp, the potential must be a decreasing function of q, that is

It should be noted that q may not take on arbitrary values. Indeed, as we have deﬁned it, q
has a minimum value of 0. There will also be a maximum value at which point the cone falls
through the rails. This point corresponds to the double cone contacting the ramp at its very
tips. Hence a = 0 and, from equation (10),

In the next section we shall see an unexpected property of the motion about the fall-through
point, q = L tan ψ/ tan α.

6 A Surprising Feature

The reader should note the position dependent coeﬃcient in the inertial term of our expression
for energy (12). It is this term that gives the system unique behavior beyond what has been
discussed so far.

Figure 10:

˙q vs. q phase portrait for φ = ψ = π

6 , θ = π

12 , L = m = 1.

Figure 10 shows the ˙q vs. q phase portrait for the system with φ = ψ = π/6, θ = π/12,
and L = m = 1. The ﬁrst astonishing fact is that all of the curves go through the same point.
This is the fall-through point and it will be the subject a more exhaustive discussion below.

10

Shown in ﬁgure 10 as a thick curve is the zero energy trajectory. Those curves contained
within it correspond to progressively more negative energies. Those exterior, progressively more
positive. One may be tempted to identify, as cycles, the negative energy trajectories. However,
the fall-through point is a singularity. While all the trajectories approach it arbitrarily as
t
, none of them actually reach it. Thus, the negative energy curves are all open by one
point. Their ‘open loop’ shape merely illustrates the simple fact that, when the cone is placed
at the top of the ramp and given an initial shove, the cone will roll down for a bit and then roll
back up.

∞

→

+

To illustrate just what it is about the motion that is so startling, let’s focus on a single
trajectory. Consider the E = 0 energy curve corresponding to releasing the cone from rest at
the bottom of the ramp (as the demonstration is typically performed). This predicts that, at
ﬁrst, the cone’s translational speed will be increasing reaching maximum value at about midway
along its path after which the translational speed will begin to ebb, decreasing to zero at the
fall-through point. The cone will indeﬁnitely approach but never reach the fall-through point.
Though, at ﬁrst, hard to accept, with a little thought, one may see that this behavior does in
fact make physical sense.

To make things more concrete let us divide the path of the CM in to equal tiny increments
of, ∆q = ǫ. Since the potential is linear, the cone will gain a ﬁxed amount of energy, δ, over
each increment. Also, since a is a linear function of q, it will decrease by a ﬁxed amount, ∆a,
over each increment.

Now, let us for the moment, consider a simpliﬁed situation; namely, we shall adjust the
inclination of the ramp so that the system is potentially neutral and have a physicist take over
gravity’s job. We shall stipulate:

1. the cone will be given an initial speed v;

2. the physicist will provide and only enough energy over each increment so as to keep the

cone translating as speed v;

3. the physicist shall not give the cone more than δ energy per increment.

From the rolling without slipping constraint we may write the cone’s rotational energy as
Trot = 1

a2 . Diﬀerentiating we obtain

2I v2

∆Trot =

1
2

I

v2
a3 ∆a ,

(13)

for the amount of energy needed over each increment to keep the cone translating at speed
v. Since a goes from a maximum to zero, we can always ﬁnd a position along the ramp for
which this amount exceeds δ. At this point, the physicist will fail to maintain the cone at
its current translational speed. However, the physicist may transfer some of the translational
energy into rotation, causing the cone to slow down and repeat the process for each of the
following intervals.

Returning to the actual situation, with the cone rolling freely on the ramp, it is the same
principle that is responsible for the cone’s peculiar motion. However, the accountant that keeps
track of energy transactions is no longer the physicist but gravity. Also, in this case, energy
is initially being proportioned between the translational and rotational energy. We may for

11

the sake of argument, use the speed of the cone, say, one microsecond after release, as the v
in equation (13). No matter how small it is, we may still ﬁnd a position for which the right
hand side of equation (13) exceeds δ. In reality the initial increase of the speed of the cone
as it moves along only serves to bring about the cross-over point sooner. As seen in ﬁgure 10,
the higher the energy, the more the curve ‘ﬂattens’ at the beginning, eventually loosing the
increasing part altogether.

By straightforward extension of the above argument, we thus, see more and more energy
has to be transferred form translation to rotation as a shrinks down to zero. This results in an
asymptotic behavior of pure rotation about the symmetry axis. The energy transfer mechanism
in all of this is ultimately friction—which we assume to be ideal—working to keep the cone
from slipping.

Thus the ebb in the cones speed is a general feature.

Equation (14) gives the velocity of the CM as a function of position, ˙q = ˙q(q). We can ﬁnd
where the cross-over point occurs by taking the derivative of this equation and setting it equal
to zero. The resulting expression is quite turbid. More meaningful is a plot of the cross-over
point versus energy. This is shown in ﬁgure 11 where we used the same values of the parameters
used for the phase plot of ﬁgure 10.

Figure 11: Cross-over point vs. Energy

12

Notice that the cross-over point is a decreasing function of energy. As we have already
pointed out, increasing energy means increasing the starting velocity which brings the cross-
over point closer. Also interesting is that, above a certain energy, the cross-over point occurs
at negative values of q. For large enough energy, the initial velocity is so high that gravity
can never provide enough energy over an increment to keep the cone translating at its current
speed. Therefore at these energies the speed will be a strictly decreasing function of time. This
may be quickly conﬁrmed using the extreme case E

and values of q close to L tan ψ/ tan α (cone close to the fall-through point).

7.0.1 Near Vertex Regime

For small values of q, we may apply the binomial expansion to the
numerator of (14) and approximate the integral as

Figure 12 plots the solution for the example that we have been using throughout, with initial
conditions q = 0 and ˙q = 0 at t = 0. The inverse curve q = q(t), is found by reﬂection with
respect to the diagonal q = t of the unit ‘square’. Notice that the ﬁgure indicates that the cone
is speeding up.

The general form of the solution is that of the left side of ﬁgure 13, when the minus sign
is chosen in the above expression, representing the cone moving up the ramp toward the fall
through point. It is that of the right side ﬁgure 13, when the positive sign is chosen, representing
the cone moving down the ramp, starting at some point very close to the fall through point
at t = 0. Notice that the graph on the left depicts the cone speeding up as it gains potential
and that on the right slowing down as it drops in potential. In the ﬁgures, the dotted vertical
lines roughly mark oﬀ the regions in which the solutions are valid. The vertical axes are at
q = L tan ψ
tan α , the point at which the cone falls through the rails. Due to this asymptotic behavior,
it would take inﬁnite time for the cone to reach the fall-through point or reach any other point
starting from the fall-through point.

Figure 14: The simplest variation of the double-cone demo would be an hourglass sitting on a V-shaped ramp
that has its vertex elevated.

8 The Hourglass

It is not diﬃcult to invent variations on this system (see, for example [2]). In particular, one
may obtain an essentially identical motion by ‘inverting’ the double-cone as well as our ramp—
that is, ﬂipping the ramp up side down so that its vertex is at the top, and placing upon it an
hourglass-shaped object such as the one depicted in ﬁgure 14. If we deﬁne our parameters in
a similar manner as before (adjusting, as in the ﬁgure, the deﬁnition of ψ appropriately), and
redeﬁne q so that its zero now corresponds to the location of the CM when the hourglass is at
the top of the ramp and so that it increases in the direction in which the cone travels down the
ramp, we obtain for the energy,

E =

The result can be seen to posses essentially the same form as the energy of the double cone, and
thus the system’s motion will be similar, with the cone, now, tending to roll in the direction of
decreasing q–again, up the ramp–and the singularity, now, occurring at q = 0.

9 Concluding Remarks

We see that the implications of the unique geometry of this system extend far beyond the simple
conceptual explanation relying on a rough trend of the CM. Despite the simplicity of the demo,

15

the dynamical explanation, in terms of the consequences of the cone’s peculiar way of sitting on
the ramp, has revealed surprising properties. We hope that instructors of introductory physics
will be as charmed as we are by this demo and its rich physical content.

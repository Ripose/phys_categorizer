ABSTRACT: The search for Noether point symmetries for non-relativistic
charged particle motion is reduced to the solution for a set of two coupled,
linear partial diﬀerential equations for the electromagnetic ﬁeld. These equa-
tions are completely solved when the magnetic ﬁeld is produced by a ﬁxed
magnetic monopole. The result is applied to central electric ﬁeld cases, in par-
ticular to the time-dependent monopole-oscillator problem. As an additional
example of the theory, we found all Noether point symmetries and invariants
for a constant magnetic ﬁeld and a time-dependent harmonic electric ﬁeld
with a forcing term.
KEY WORDS: Noether symmetry, constant of motion, charged particle
motion, magnetic monopole.

1 Introduction

The charge-monopole problem is a classical subject in Physics. In the present
work, in particular, we consider symmetries and conservation laws for the
Lorentz equations of the form

¨r = −∇ V (r, t) + g

˙r × r
r3

,

(1)

applying Noether’s theorem. Here, r = (x, y, z) is the position vector in R3.
The system (1) describes three-dimensional, non-relativistic charged particle
motion under an electric ﬁeld E = −∇ V (r, t) and a ﬁxed magnetic monopole

ﬁeld with strength g. However, the scope of our work is more general, since
our formalism apply to general electromagnetic ﬁelds. We make an eﬀort to
extend the results of [3, 4], where all the Noether and Lie points symmetries
for two-dimensional, non-relativistic charged particle motions were found.
Unlike the planar case, the fully three-dimensional case seems to be not
accessible to a complete solution. Hence, we focus mainly on the magnetic
monopole ﬁeld case, which is amenable to complete calculations.

Let us review the state of the art on the search for constants of motion for
the charge-monopole system. In the simpler case when the electric force is
central and time-independent (V = V (r), r = (x2 + y2 + z2)1/2), the Lorentz
equations admit the vector ﬁrst integral

D = r × ˙r − gˆr ,

where ˆr is the unit vector in the radial direction. The vector D, the so-called
Poincar´e vector, was used by Poincar´e [9] to obtain the exact solution for the
motion when only the magnetic monopole is present (V = 0). It should be
mentioned that the Poincar´e vector survives as a constant of motion even if
there is an explicit time-dependence of the scalar potential.

More recently [6], it were considered the scalar potentials

V =

0r2
ω2

+

g2
2r2

and

V = −

µ0
r
where ω0 and µ0 are numerical constants. All bounded trajectories are pe-
riodic [6] when the scalar potential is given by (3) or (4). For the potential
(3), linked to the isotropic harmonic oscillator, there is a tensor conserved
quantity, whose components, using complex notation, are

Tij = ( ˙ui + iω0ui)( ˙uj − iω0uj) ,

where u = D × ˆr. In the case of the potential (4), related to the Coulomb
or Kepler forces, we have the vector constant of motion

a generalization of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector for the Kepler problem.
Both (5) and (6) are constants of motion in the form of quadratic functions

F = D × ˙r + µ0ˆr ,

of the velocity. It can be demonstrated [13] that (3) and (4) are among the
few time-independent central potentials for which (1) has quadratic integrals
other than the energy. At the quantum level, there is degeneracy of the
spectra for these potentials, in connection [5] with the invariance algebra
su(2) ⊕ su(2).

In contradistinction to these earlier works, here we consider the eﬀects of
the superposition of a non-central, time-dependent electric force on the mo-
tion of charged particles under a ﬁxed magnetic monopole ﬁeld. An immedi-
ate result of the presence of non-central electric ﬁelds is the non-conservation
of the Poincar´e vector (2). However, at least for particular forms of V (r, t),
it can be expected that some conservation law is present. To address the
question, we pursue here the analysis of Noether point symmetries.

As an additional example of the theory, we found all Noether point sym-
metries and invariants for a constant magnetic ﬁeld and a time-dependent
harmonic electric ﬁeld with a forcing term.
In this case there is a 12-
parameter or a 8-parameter group of symmetries, according to a condition
on the parameters specifying the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Apart from it’s obvi-
ous physical signiﬁcance, the extra example shows how to apply the general
theory of this work to situations for which the electromagnetic ﬁeld has a
more particular form, known in advance.
The article is structured as follows.

In Section II, we investigate the
Noether point symmetries for non-relativistic charged particle motion under
general electromagnetic ﬁelds. The whole problem is reduced to a set of two
coupled, linear partial diﬀerential equations for the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In
Section III, we completely solve this system of equations when the magnetic
ﬁeld is in the form of a ﬁxed magnetic monopole ﬁeld. Two classes of electric
ﬁeld are determined, related to quadratic or linear constants of motion. These
electric ﬁelds can be freely superimposed to the magnetic monopole ﬁeld, with
no harm on the existence of Noether point symmetries. In Section IV, the
previous results are applied to the central electric ﬁeld cases. In particular,
we study the time-dependent monopole-oscillator system. In Section V, the
case of a constant magnetic ﬁeld is analyzed. Unlike the magnetic monopole
problem, here we will not try to ﬁnd the general class of admissible electric
ﬁelds. Instead, we focus only on linear electric ﬁelds, which are amenable to
exact calculations. Section VI is dedicated to the conclusion.

conserved along the trajectories of the Euler-Lagrange equations.

Noether’s theorem is applicable to any Lagrangian system, as is the case
for non-relativistic motion of a charged particle under a general electromag-
netic ﬁeld. Introduce vector A(r, t) and scalar V (r, t) potentials, so that the
Lagrangian is given by

L =

˙r2 + A(r, t) · ˙r − V (r, t) .

The corresponding electromagnetic ﬁelds are

B = ∇ × A , E = −∇ V − ∂A/∂t

.

Inserting L in the symmetry condition (9), we ﬁnd a polynomial form of
the velocity components. The coeﬃcient of each monomial should be zero.
Such a prescription results in a system of linear partial diﬀerential equations
determining both the symmetry generator and the vector and scalar poten-
tials. Actually, we will show in the continuation that it is possible to reduce
the discussion to the electromagnetic ﬁeld only, without any mention to the
electromagnetic potentials.

Putting forward the calculation of Noether symmetries, the monomial of

third order on the velocity gives, using component notation,

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

thus implying

∂τ
∂ri

= 0 ,

τ = ρ2(t) ,

where ρ(t) is an arbitrary function of time. Now, the monomial of second
order on the velocity imposes

∂nj

− 2 δijρ ˙ρ = 0 ,

where the Kronecker delta was used. The solution is

n = ρ ˙ρr + Ω(t) × r + a(t) ,

where Ω(t) and a(t) are arbitrary vector functions of time.

Assembling (14-16), we conclude that the most general form of the Noether

point symmetry generator is

G = ρ2(t)

∂
∂t

+ (ρ ˙ρr + Ω(t) × r + a(t)) ·

(17)

∂
∂r

,

for arbitrary ρ(t), Ω(t) and a(t). The resulting symmetries include a gen-
eralized rescaling, a time-dependent rotation and a time-dependent space
translation. Up to this point, there is no restriction on the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. Notice that (17) is the proper extension of the Noether point symme-
tries generator for two-dimensional non-relativistic charged particle motion
derived in [3].

The remaining equations implied by the symmetry condition (9) are

∇F = GA + ρ ˙ρA + A × Ω + ∂n/∂t ,
∂F/∂t = −G V − 2ρ ˙ρV + A · ∂n/∂t ,

(18)
(19)

in which the form (17) was taken into account. Also, we have used the
deﬁnition

+ (ρ ˙ρr + Ω(t) × r + a(t)) ·

(20)

valid for a generic function W = W (r, t).

Equations (18–19) have a solution F if and only if

∂2F
∂ri∂rj

∂2F

,

∂2F
∂ri∂t

=

Using (18–19) in (21), we obtain

GB = −2ρ ˙ρB − 2 ˙Ω + Ω × B ,

GE = −3ρ ˙ρE + Ω × E + B ×

(21)

(22)

(23)

involving only the electromagnetic ﬁelds, not the electromagnetic potentials.
Hence, the choice of gauge does not have any inﬂuence in the search for
Noether point symmetries.

Equations (22–23) are the fundamental equations for the determination of
Noether point symmetries for non-relativistic charged particle motion. It is a
system of coupled, linear partial diﬀerential equations for the ﬁelds E and B,
involving the functions ρ, Ω and a that deﬁne the generator G. The system
to be satisﬁed by the electromagnetic ﬁelds is the proper three-dimensional
extension of the system (34-36) found in [3] in the planar charged particle
motion case. As long as we know, this is the ﬁrst time equations (22-23) are
explicitly written.

Unlike the two-dimensional case, it seems that the complete solution of
(22-23) is not available. Thus, a complete classiﬁcation of the electromag-
netic ﬁelds for which the three-dimensional non-relativistic charged particle
motion possesses Noether point symmetries is not known. The technical dif-
ﬁculties arising in the fully three-dimensional case are related to the problem
of ﬁnding the canonical group coordinates associated to the generator (17),
for arbitrary functions ρ(t), Ω(t) and a(t). Nevertheless, equations (22-23)
are useful in the investigation of speciﬁc electromagnetic ﬁelds. For instance,
in what follows we show that when the magnetic ﬁeld is produced by a ﬁxed
magnetic monopole it is possible to obtain the general solution for (22-23).
Of course, the electromagnetic ﬁelds satisfying (22-23) must also comply
with Maxwell equations, a condition that is not immediately assured. The
non-homogeneous Maxwell equations may always be satisﬁed by a convenient
choice of charge and current densities. There remains the Gauss law for mag-
netism and Faraday’s law. Gauss law is removed when magnetic monopoles
are present. In these cases, Faraday’s law is the only extra requirement.

6

Once the system (22–23) is solved for the electromagnetic ﬁeld, the Noether

invariant follows from (10), reading

I = (˙r2/2 + V )ρ2 − (˙r + A) · n + F .

(24)

The invariant I is a quadratic polynomial on the velocities when ρ 6= 0.
Otherwise, for ρ = 0, I is a linear polynomial on the velocities. It is apparent
from (24) that the Noether invariant needs the electromagnetic potentials as
well as the function F (r, t) obtained from (18–19). However, as we will see
in concrete examples, the form of I is in practice independent of gauge, as
expected.

Equations (22-23), restricted to planar motions, were completely solved
in [3]. In the next Section we pursue a less ambitious program, taking B as
the ﬁeld of a ﬁxed magnetic monopole and studying the consequences of this
choice on the generator G and on the electric ﬁeld.

3 Magnetic monopole

Here we apply the formalism of Section II to the case of a magnetic monopole
ﬁxed at origin and with strength g,

B =

g r
r3 .

Inserting (25) in (22), the result is a condition on the functions ρ, Ω and a
composing the symmetry,

g (r2a − 3a · rr)r−5 − ˙Ω = 0 .

Notice that ρ is not present, remaining arbitrary. Equation (26) is identically
satisﬁed if and only if

a = ˙Ω = 0 .

Consequently, the generator of Noether point symmetries is speciﬁed by

In other words,

G = ρ2 ∂
∂t

+ (ρ ˙ρr + Ω × r) ·

∂
∂r

.

G = Gρ + Ω · L ,

7

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

where

Gρ = ρ2 ∂
∂ t

+ ρ ˙ρr ·

∂

(30)

is the generator of quasi-invariance transformations [1, 8], Ω is from now on
a constant vector and L = (L1, L2, L3) is deﬁned by

L1 = y

(31)

∂

We recognize L1, L2 and L3 as the generators of the so(3) algebra.

The electric ﬁelds compatible with Noether point symmetry satisfy (23).

With generator given by (28), this equation for E reads

GE = −3ρ ˙ρE + Ω × E + (ρ

···
ρ + 3 ˙ρ¨ρ)r .

(32)

Notice that the strength g does not appear on (32).

Before considering (32) in the general case, it is instructive to examine
ﬁrst the case E = 0, in which only the magnetic monopole is present. For no
electric ﬁeld, (32) reduces to

whose general solution is

···
ρ + 3 ˙ρ¨ρ = 0 ,

ρ

ρ2 = c1 + c2t + c3t2 ,

where c1, c2 and c3 are arbitrary constants. We conclude by the existence of
three symmetry generators,

These generators are associated, respectively, to time translation, self-simi-
larity and conformal transformations, composing the so(2, 1) algebra, with
commutation relations

[G1, G2] = G1 ,

[G1, G3] = 2G2 ,

[G2, G3] = G3 .

(36)

Therefore, the problem where only the magnetic monopole is present is en-
dowed with the SO(2, 1)× SO(3) group of Noether point symmetries. Such a

(33)

(34)

(35)

8

result was already obtained by Jackiw [2], using dynamical Noether transfor-
mations, and by Moreira et al. [7], using Lie point symmetries and no varia-
tional formulation. Lie’s approach has the advantage of no necessity of elec-
tromagnetic potentials, which are always singular when magnetic monopoles
are present. However, as seen in Section II, the basic equations (22–23) can
be formulated in terms of the electromagnetic ﬁeld only. Moreover, we shall
see in practice the gauge invariance of the Noether invariant. Our procedure
is simpler than, for instance, the use of ﬁber bundles to avoid the singularity
of the vector potential [12].

The solution for (32) comprises two categories, one for ρ 6= 0 and the other
for ρ = 0. Accordingly, (24) shows that each class of solution is associated
to quadratic or linear constants of motion, respectively.

3.1 The case ρ 6= 0

Using the method of characteristics, we ﬁnd that when ρ 6= 0 the solution
for (32) is given by

E =

¨ρ

ρ4 Ω × (Ω × r) +

for R(Ω¯t) the rotation matrix about Ω by an angle Ω¯t. The symbol T is for
the transpose. Also, in (37) ¯E is an arbitrary vector function of the indicated
argument. For Ω = (0, 0, Ω), the explicit form of the rotation matrix is

The reader can directly verify that (37) satisfy (32). For this check, the

G = ∂/∂¯t

(42)

that is, ¯r and ¯t are canonical group coordinates for the Noether point sym-
metries with ρ 6= 0, so that G is the generator of translations along ¯t.

We see, on the electric ﬁeld, the presence of the arbitrary functions ρ and
¯E. However, for the vector ﬁeld (37) to qualify as a true electric ﬁeld, it must
complain with Faraday’s law,

which imposes, for E as in (37),

∇ × E +

= 0 ,

∂B
∂t

R(Ω¯t) · ( ¯∇ × ¯E(¯r)) = 0 ,

where ¯∇ = ∂/∂¯r. As the rotation matrix R is non singular, the only way of
satisfying (44) is

¯E = − ¯∇ U(¯r)

for some function U(¯r). The remaining Maxwell equations (with exception
of Gauss law for magnetism, which has been ruled out) can be satisﬁed by
an appropriate choice of charge nq and current Jq densities,

is the general form of the admissible electric ﬁelds, compatible with Noether

ﬁeld depend on the arbitrary functions ρ and U, as well as on the constant

(48)

vector Ω. Central ﬁelds are obtained as particular cases taking Ω = 0 and
U = U(¯r), where ¯r is the norm of ¯r.

The Noether invariant (24) require the electromagnetic potentials, as well
as the function F solution of (18–19). In full generality, the electromagnetic
potentials are given by

A =

(y, −x, 0) + ∇λ(r, t) ,

g z
r(x2 + y2)
¨ρ r2
1
2ρ4 (Ω × r)2 +

where λ(r, t) is an arbitrary gauge function. Inserting the electromagnetic
potentials into (18-19), there results a system whose solution is

I =

(52)

As anticipated, I is not dependent on the gauge function λ.

3.2 The case ρ = 0

For ρ = 0, (32) reduces to

Ω × r ·

= Ω × E .

∂E
∂r

(53)

Since Ω is a constant vector, there is no loss of generality if we set Ω =
(0, 0, Ω) in (53), with Ω 6= 0, so that G becomes L3, the generator of rotations
about the z axis. In this situation, the general solution for (53) is

E = Er(r, θ, t)ˆr + Eθ(r, θ, t)ˆθ + Eφ(r, θ, t) ˆφ ,

(54)

using spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) with unit vectors ˆr, ˆθ and ˆφ and such
that x = r cos φ sin θ, y = r sin φ sin θ, and z = r cos θ. The class (54) is the
general class of electric ﬁelds compatible with azimuthal symmetry. With an

11

appropriated scalar potential V = V (r, θ, t) as well as the vector potential
(49), it can be proven that

F = Gλ

is the solution for (18–19). The corresponding Noether invariant (24) is

I3 = Ω3(y ˙x − x ˙y + g z/r) ,

(55)

(56)

gauge independent. This ﬁrst integral is proportional to the third component
of the Poincar´e vector (2).

If, in addition to the symmetry of rotation about one axis, we impose
the existence of symmetry of rotation about a diﬀerent axis, it can be easily
proven that the solution for (53) is

E = E(r, t)ˆr ,

(57)

the general class of central, time-dependent ﬁelds. The result is explained
by the so(3) algebra. For instance, the presence of the extra symmetry of
rotations about the y axis imply rotational symmetry about the x axis, since
[L2, L3] = −L1 and by deﬁnition the symmetry algebra is closed. In a similar
way to (56), it can be then veriﬁed that the Noether invariants associated to
the SO(3) group are the three components of the Poincar´e vector. Of course,
this is not the ﬁrst time that the Poincar´e vector is shown to be associated
to rotational symmetry (see, for instance, reference [2]).

4 Central electric forces

When the electric ﬁeld is central, the Poincar´e vector is immediately con-
served, as a result of the SO(3) symmetry.
In this case, the discussion
can be reduced to essentially one-dimensional, time-dependent motion. To
see this, choose axis so that the conserved Poincar´e vector may be written
D = (0, 0, D). Decomposing D in components and using spherical coordi-
nates, we get

cos θ = −g/D ,

˙φ = D/r2 ,

while the radial component of the Lorentz equation reads, from (57) and
(58),

(58)

(59)

¨r = E(r, t) +

D2 − g2
r3

.

12

Eq. (58) shows that the motion is on a circular cone whose vertex contains
the monopole, and that the angle φ can be obtained from a simple quadra-
ture once the radial variable is found from the solution of (59). This latter
equation involves only r and time.

The presence of extra Noether invariants helps for the integration of (59).
Since the electric ﬁeld is central, the category of Noether symmetries de-
scribed in subsection III.1 are admitted if and only if

Ω = 0 , U = U(¯r) ,

¯r = r/ρ ,

(60)

In the following, we will consider in more detail a case in which the function
U can be conveniently chosen, so that there is an extra Noether symmetry.
Let us illustrate the initial results of the Section with the electric ﬁeld

E = −ω2(t)r + σ2r/r4 .

(61)

where ω(t) is an arbitrary function of time and σ is a numerical constant.
As observed in the Introduction, for constant ω and σ = g, all bounded
trajectories are periodic for this electric ﬁeld. In the general, time-dependent
case, (61) produces the time-dependent monopole-oscillator problem, with in
addition a repulsive force.

As the electric force is central, SO(3) is known to be admitted in advance,
the Poincar´e vector being conserved. Besides this obvious symmetry, there
is also symmetry in the form of a quasi-invariance transformation. To see
this, notice that the scalar potential

V = ω2(t)r2/2 + σ2/2r2

can be put in the form (50) with λ = 0 if and only if

U

The right-hand side of (63) is properly a function of r/ρ if and only if ρ
satisﬁes Pinney’s [10] equation

where k is a constant. In this case, we have

¨ρ + ω2(t)ρ = k/ρ3 ,

U(¯r) =

In conclusion, the time-dependent monopole oscillator system with an extra
repulsive force do have, besides SO(3) symmetry, quasi-invariance transfor-
mations as Noether symmetries, provided the function ρ satisﬁes Pinney’s
equation.

A more convenient formulation of the invariance properties of the system

is provided by the linearising transform

so that Pinney’s equation becomes, upon diﬀerentiation,

ψ = ρ2 ,

···
ψ + 4ω2 ˙ψ + 4ω ˙ωψ = 0 .

ψ = c1ψ1 + c2ψ2 + c3ψ3 ,

The general solution for this last equation is any linear combination of three
independent particular solutions ψ1, ψ2 and ψ3,

where c1, c2 and c3 are numerical constants. To each solution ψi correspond
one associated Noether point symmetry, with generator of the form (30) with
ψi = ρ2

with i = 1, 2, 3, and where we have eliminated the constant k using Pinney’s
equation.

The Noether symmetries and invariants can be explicitly shown when the

general solution for (68) is available. In particular, when

a constant, the general solution is

ψ = c1 + c2 cos(2ω0t) + c3 sin(2ω0t) .

(73)

The corresponding generators (70), obtained for c1 = 1, c2 = c3 = 0 and
cyclic permutations, are

G1 =

G2 = cos(2ω0t)

− ω0 sin(2ω0t)r ·

These generators, together with the generators of SO(3), determine the al-

[G3, G1] = −2ω0G2
[Gi, Lj] = 0 ,

i, j = 1, 2, 3 .

(75)

Therefore, the Noether point symmetry algebra for the time-independent
monopole-oscillator with an extra repulsive force have a so(2, 1) ⊕ so(3)
structure, the same symmetry algebra as in the simple magnetic monopole
case.

As already seen, SO(3) invariance is associated to the Poincar´e vector.
On the other hand, invariance under G1, G2 and G3 corresponds, respectively,
to the constants of motion

I1 =

(˙r2 + ω2

As discussed in the beginning of the Section, the fact that the electric ﬁeld
is central allows to reduce the problem to the solution for the radial variable.
Here, the existence of the Noether invariants allows the direct solution for
r(t) by elimination of ˙r between the invariants I1, I2 and I3, with the result

r2(t) =

1
ω2
0

(I1 − I2 cos(2ω0t) − I3 sin(2ω0t)) ,

(78)

Inserting r(t) into (58) and integrating, it follows that the azimuthal variable
is

φ(t) = φ0 + arctan

−I3 + (I1 + I2) tan(2ω0t)
ω0D

,

!

 

(79)

where φ0 is a reference angle.

Formulae (58) and (78–79) are the exact solution for the time-independent
monopole-oscillator problem with an repulsive force. The exact solution in-
volves four independent integration constants, I1, I2, I3 and φ0, while D is
functionally dependent on these constants through (77). The exact solution
does not contain six integration constants since, from the very beginning,
two components of the Poincar´e vector were annulled. The remaining two
constants can be easily incorporated, with the price of a less clear presenta-
tion. Finally, it should be stressed that any time-dependent frequency such
that (68) can be exactly solved leads to exact solution in the same way as
the time-independent case.

5 Constant magnetic ﬁeld

In this Section, we consider the physically relevant case of a constant mag-
netic ﬁeld,

B = (0, 0, B0) ,

(80)

where B0 is a numerical constant, and look for Noether point symmetries and
invariants for appropriate electric ﬁelds. More precisely, unlike the magnetic
monopole case, we do not search for the more general class of electric ﬁelds
for which some Noether point symmetry is available. In fact, we restrict the
treatment to time-dependent linear electric ﬁelds. Such a restriction is again
physically meaningful.

16

Inserting (80) into (22) there results an equation for the vector Ω respon-

sible for time-dependent rotations,

˙Ω =

Ω × B − ρ ˙ρB .

2

The above system is easily solved,

Ω1 = c1 cos(B0t/2) + c2 sin(B0t/2) ,
Ω2 = −c1 sin(B0t/2) + c2 cos(B0t/2) ,
Ω3 = c3 − B0ρ2/2 ,

where the ci are integration constants. With the result (83), the determining
equation (23) for the electric ﬁeld is expressed as

G E = −3ρ ˙ρE + Ω × E + (ρ

0ρ ˙ρ)r +

+ (B · r)(

Ω × B − ρ ˙ρB) +

(Ω × B) · r B + B × ˙a + ¨a . (83)

We have not found the general solution for (83), so that the general class
of admissible electric ﬁelds remains to be determined. However, there is at
least one case amenable to exact calculations, namely the particular case of
linear electric ﬁelds of the form

E = −ω2

⊥(t)r⊥ − ω2

k(t)rk + f(t) ,

(84)

where r⊥ = (x, y, 0), rk = (0, 0, z), f = (f1(t), f2(t), f3(t)) and ω⊥, ωk and
the fi are time-dependent functions. When the electric ﬁeld is linear, both
sides of (83) are linear functions of the coordinates. Equating to zero the
coeﬃcients of each coordinate and of the independent term, the result is a
coupled system of ordinary diﬀerential equations for the functions ρ and a
composing the symmetry generator,

In (87-89), the vector d = (d1, d2, d3) is deﬁned according to

d = ρ2 ˙f + 3ρ ˙ρf + f × Ω .

Once the system (85-90) is solved, the associated Noether invariant is
found from (24), which require both the electromagnetic potentials and the
function F , solution for (18-19). The electromagnetic potentials are

gauge independent as it must be. For the explicit form of the Noether invari-

remain to be obtained.

After a detailed but straightforward analysis, we distinguish two classes
of solutions for the system (85-90), according to the functions ω⊥ and ωk
entering the electric ﬁeld and the magnetic ﬁeld strength. The two classes of
solutions are treated separately.

5.1 The ω2
In the situation where the relation ω2
0/4 is valid, the condition
(90) becomes an identity, so that the components Ω1 and Ω2 are left free.
Referring to equation (83) deﬁning the vector Ω for a constant magnetic ﬁeld,
this means that the constants c1 and c2 are left free. Moreover, the equations
(85) and (86) are identical, becoming, using the linearising transform ψ = ρ2,

0/4 case
k(t) = ω2

⊥(t)+B2

a third-order linear equation. Denote the general solution as

˙ψ + 4ωk ˙ωkψ = 0 ,

ψ = c4ψ1 + c5ψ2 + c6ψ3 ,

(96)

(97)

where ci are numerical constants and ψi independent particular solutions.
Taking into account the three arbitrary numerical constants entering Ω, plus
c4, c5, c6 and the six integration constants for the system (87-89), we arrive
at a 12-parameter group of Noether point symmetries.

The construction of the symmetry group is best explained with a concrete
example. In the last part of the Section, let us study in more detail the case

f = 0 ,

˙ω⊥ = ˙ωk = 0 ,

(98)

that is, the cases of time-independent harmonic ﬁelds with no forcing term.
In this context, (96) is easily solved, giving

ψ = c4 + c5 cos(2ωkt) + c6 sin(2ωkt) .

(99)

In addition, the system (87-89) has the general solution

a1 = c7 cos(ω1t) + c8 sin(ω1t) + c9 cos(ω2t) − c10 sin(ω2t) ,
a2 = −c7 sin(ω1t) + c8 cos(ω1t) + c9 sin(ω2t) + c10 cos(ω2t) ,

G1 = cos(B0t/2)(y∂/∂z − z∂/∂y) − sin(B0t/2)(z∂/∂x − x∂/∂z) ,

G5 = cos(2ωkt) (∂/∂t − (B0/2)(x∂/∂y − y∂/∂x)) − ωk sin(2ωkt) r · ∇ ,
G6 = sin(2ωkt) (∂/∂t − (B0/2)(x∂/∂y − y∂/∂x)) + ωk cos(2ωkt) r · ∇ ,

G8 = sin(ω1t)∂/∂x + cos(ω1t)∂/∂y ,
G9 = cos(ω2t)∂/∂x + sin(ω2t)∂/∂y ,

0/4 case

In this situation, condition (90) is satisﬁed only if Ω1 = Ω2 = 0. This rules
out rotational symmetries about the x and y axis, and imply c1 = c2 = 0 in
(83). In addition, equations (85) and (86) are equivalent only if ρ = c4, a
numerical constant. In fact, it is possible, in principle, to have non constant
solutions for ρ satisfying both (85-86). However, this possibility is allowed
only if ωk and ω⊥ are related by a somewhat complicated relation which
0/4
we refrain from writing here.
generically there is a 8-parameter group of Noether point symmetries. This
group comprises rotations about the z axis, time-translation and the six
time-dependent space translations determined by the solution of (87-89).
Accordingly, in the time-independent case with no forcing term, speciﬁed by
(98), the symmetries generated by G2, G3, G5 and G6 are lost, as well as the
associated Noether invariants. Even if the symmetry structure is less rich, it
is suﬃcient for the general solution of the equations of motion, since the six
time-dependent translational symmetries are not broken.

6 Conclusion

We have obtained the system of partial diﬀerential equations to be satisﬁed
by the electromagnetic ﬁeld so that the action functional for non-relativistic
motion is invariant under continuous point transformations. This system of
equations has been completely solved when the magnetic ﬁeld is produced
by a ﬁxed magnetic monopole. The associated constants of motion can have
linear or quadratic dependencies on the velocity. These constants of motion
can be used to integrate the Lorentz equations, as in the monopole-oscillator
problem with an extra repulsive force ﬁeld. Moreover, we have treated the
case of a constant magnetic ﬁeld plus a harmonic electric ﬁeld with a forcing
term.

21

The main open problem that still deserves attention is the complete solu-
tion of the basic system (22-23) for the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The technical
drawback here is the determination of the canonical group coordinates for the
generator G in (17) with arbitrary ρ(t), Ω(t) and a(t). It can be veriﬁed that
this issue can be solved at least when Ω(t) has a ﬁxed direction. Other par-
ticular solutions may be valuable. In addition, the system (22-23) is worth
to be considered in the case of other particular electromagnetic ﬁelds, for
which the magnetic ﬁeld is not in the form of a magnetic monopole or of a
constant ﬁeld.

Other direction of research is the search for Lie point symmetries for
non-relativistic charged particle motion under generic electromagnetic ﬁelds.
In the two-dimensional case, this problem can be completely solved [4]. In
three dimensions, certainly the diﬃculties are greater than those we are faced
in the case of Noether point symmetries, since the Noether group of point
symmetries is a subgroup of the Lie group of point symmetries. Again,
the stumbling block is the ﬁnding of canonical group coordinates for the
generator of Lie symmetries. Finally, further extensions involve the use of
transformations of more general character, such as dynamical or nonlocal
transformations.

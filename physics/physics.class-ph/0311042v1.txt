A Remark on the Kramers Problem

Alex A. Samoletov1

We present new point of view on the old problem, the Kramers problem. The
passage from the Fokker-Planck equation to the Smoluchowski equation, includ-
ing corrections to the Smoluchowski current, is treated through an asymptotic
expansion of the solution of the stochastic dynamical equations. The case of an
extremely weak force of friction is also discussed.

Evolution of a physical system can be ordered in multi-time-
scales. Details of evolution on short-time-scale do not need for description
in a closed form of a system evolution on long-time-scale and appears on
this scale only in an average form. The prototype of such kind physical sys-
tems is dissipative Brownian motion of a particle in an external potential
ﬁeld. In this problem, with the exception of extremely short characteristic
time scales of random forces, there are two time scales: (1) time scales of a
particle motion in an external ﬁeld; (2) time scales of relaxation (rate of dis-
sipation) of Brownian particle in a media. It is intuitively absolutely clear
that, if the friction force is strong enough (time of free motion is extremely
short), then probability distribution of a particle velocity to be rapidly
relaxed to the Maxwell distribution and on this background a particle po-
sition will be undergoing to slow process of diﬀusion. In the following we
deal with the consideration of approximate reduction of the Fokker-Planck
equation for phase-space probability density to the Smoluchowski equation
which deals with probability density of a particle position only. In the op-
posite case of extremely weak force of friction we have energy (or action)

2. The Kramers problem consist in mathematical description of ap-
proximate reductions of the Fokker-Planck equation for dissipative Brow-
nian motion of a particle in an external ﬁeld to the two limiting cases: (1)
to the Smoluchowski equation (extremely strong force of friction) or (2) to
equation for probability density of energy (or action) variable (extremely
weak force of friction)(1). These reduction procedures are the prototypes
of all adiabatic elimination procedures or procedures of separation on slow
and fast variables(2).

The Kramers model(1), ﬁrstly formulated for kinetics of chemical re-
actions, consists of a particle of mass m moving in an one-dimensional
potential ﬁeld U (x) under inﬂuence of a random force f (t) and a linear
friction force with a constant dissipation rate λ. The corresponding set of
Langevin equations has the following form

˙x = u,

m ˙u = −U

(x) − λmu + f (t),

(1)

where the random force f (t) is generalized Gaussian δ-correlated stochas-
tic processes (white noise) with the following properties (including the
ﬂuctuation-dissipation relation)

hf (t)i = 0,

hf (t)f (t

)i = 2λmkBT δ(t − t

);

(2)

′

h· · · i denotes average over all realizations of random force.

The Langevin (1)-(2) dynamics is stochastically equivalent to the

Fokker-Planck equation for the rate of change of probability density P (u, x; t)
which has the form (e.g.(2))

∂tP (u, x; t) = −u∂xP +

where ∂t = ∂/∂t, ∂x = ∂/∂x, and ∂u = ∂/∂u.

Keeping in mind (1)-(3) we formulate the problem in the following
manner:
in the case of extremely strong force of friction beginning with
(3) or equivalently (1)-(2) to derive the approximate reduction to an equa-
tion for the rate of change of probability density P (x; t) in the form of
asymptotic expansion by the parameter λ−1:

∂tP (x; t) = −∂x[λ

−1)],

where JS is the Smoluchowski current,

JS = −[U

(x)P (x; t) + kBT ∂xP (x; t)]/m

In other words it is asymptotics of strong force of friction on time scales

A Remark on the Kramers Problem

1353

This problem has long history starting since 1940, the date of pub-
lication of the Kramers famous work(1). For relevant references including
reviews of the problem see refs. 2–5. The ﬁrst treatment of the problem
has been down in ref. 6 and the ﬁrst correct solution has been down in
ref. 7 and then in refs. 8–10. The works(10−14) are of importance for the
following in respect of treatment of the corrections older then λ−3 which
break the Fokker-Planck structure of (4). Most general treatment of the
problem has been down in ref. 15.

3. All of the cited works deal with (3) as the input equation for a
solution of the problem. The purpose of this paper is to take notice of
the fact that (1)-(2) are indeed convenient input equations for an answer
to the problem. With respect to solutions of (1)-(2) we use the method of
asymptotic expansion by the parameter λ−1. In the way, the Fokker-Planck
type equations (4) to be derived from approximate stochastic dynamical
equations in each order of λ−1. Moreover, Fokker-Planck equation is an ap-
proximate equation and in any case must be derived from input dynamical
equations. Convenient and powerful method of derivation, in particular, of
the Fokker-Planck type equations immediately from stochastic equations
has been initiated by Novikov(16) and then it has been suﬃciently devel-
oped by Klyatskin(17). In the following we use this method systematically.
In this connection it should be pointed out that the Klyatskin-Novikov the-
ory, generally, interprets a stochastic diﬀerential equation in the sense of
Stratonovich. However, in the case under consideration it does not matter.
We refer the reader to refs. 16 and 17 for further information.

The probability density P (x; t) can be written in the form(17)

P (x; t) = hδ(x − x(t))i,

where x(t) is a stochastic process and δ(· · · ) is δ-function. Diﬀerentiating
this deﬁnition by time we obtain the equation

∂tP (x; t) = −∂xh ˙x(t)δ(x − x(t))i ≡ −∂xJ(x; t),

(6)

which has the form of a conservation law and is the proforma for an equation
of the type (4). If x(t) is deﬁned by (1), our problem is in calculation of
asymptotic expansion of ˙x(t) by λ−1 and then the corresponding average
in (6). Further insight is gained by making the following construction.

The ˙x(t), ¨x(t), and so on, can be excluded from right hand side of last
equation repeatedly using iterations of this equation and its time deriva-
tives. Then, and it is important, we are in need of expansion by λ−1 of
the stochastic process ξ(t) or, more precisely, of expansion by λ−1 of the
average in (6) which involves ξ(t). First of all we must remark that the
derivatives ˙f (t) and so on, have sense only as derivatives of the generalized
stochastic process f (t)(18) and break the simple Fokker-Planck structure
of (6) as of an second order partial diﬀerential equation. It is evident in
the frame of Klyatskin-Novikov theory(17). Namely in the process of cal-
culation of the corresponding averages according to ref. 17 we easy detect
a complex form of (6) including memory as well as an integral-operator
structure. Further, in respect of λ−1f (t) it is easy to verify(17) that cor-
responding averages in (6) have factor λ−1 because the noise (2) intensity
has the order λ.

Taking into account what has been outlined above the ﬁrst terms
of expansion of ˙x(t) by λ−1 that lead to the current J(x; t) expansion up
to order λ−3 (the maximum-order of saving of the simple Fokker-Planck
structure of (6)) can be written in the form

where JS is the Smoluchowski current (5). Asymptotic expansions of ˙x(t)
and J(x; t)(8) together with (2) lead to conventional conclusion: the Smolu-
l2|U ′′(x)| ≪ kBT ,
chowski equation is valid if: λt ≫ 1,
kBT /mλ2 is introduced. (8) contains lowest
- where a length scale l =
order correction to the Smoluchowski equation(8−10). Higher order cor-
rections in λ−1, involving in averaging time derivatives of the generalized
stochastic process f (t), lead to break of simple structure of the Smolu-
chowski equation as a second order partial diﬀerential equation.
It was
pointed out also in traditional approach(10−14,5).

4. Consider now the case of extremely weak force of friction. This
case more complicated then previous but not so interesting in calculation.
Let m = 1 in (1). In the case of extremely weak force of friction and on
the time-scale λt ≪ 1 the energy E = u2/2 + U (x) of unperturbed system
is evident candidate for slow variable. But previously E must be averaged
over period of relatively rapid dynamical oscillations. It is more convenient,
however , to consider the action variable J instead of E, J = J(E).(1) Let
J is action variable averaged over period of rapid dynamical oscillations.
Then an equation for the rate of change of probability density P (J; t) can
be written in the form (see (6))

∂tP (J; t) = −∂J h ˙J(t)δ(J − J(t))i, P (J; t) = hδ(J − J(t))i,

(9)

In usual way(1) and taking into account the change of time-scale of the
white noise(2,7) we obtain the equations of motion for slow variables

where ω = ω(J) = dE/dJ is frequency and V is velocity averaged over

For calculation of the average in right hand side of (11) we can use the

It is exactly the Kramers equation. We can derive corrections to this equa-
tion but it is slightly more diﬃcult task then in the case of extremely strong
force of friction and does not take special interest in the context of this pa-
per.

5.

In conclusion, we have presented in a simplest framework a unique
approach to the kinetic equations for slow variables by taking stochastic
dynamical equations as the input instead of the Fokker-Planck equation.
We hope that this approach is general enough.

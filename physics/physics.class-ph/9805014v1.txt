In virtue of the Chubykalo - Smirnov-Rueda generalized form of the Maxwell-Lorentz
equation a new form of the energy density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld was obtained. This
result allows us to explain a physical origin of the Oppenheimer-Ahluwalia zero-energy
solutions of the Maxwell equations.

1. Introduction

If φL(p) and φR(p) represent the massless (1, 0) and (0, 1) ﬁelds respectively [1],
then the source-free momentum-space Maxwell equation can be written as (see, e.g.,
Ref. [2])a

J · p + p0
J · p − p0
(cid:0)

φL(p) = 0

φR(p) = 0

These “dispersion relations” follow from the condition Det.

(cid:0)

This situation immediately raises two problems: (i) there are negative energy
solutions, and (ii) the equations support solutions with zero energy. One may
either declare that the negative energy solutions, and solutions with identically
vanishing energy content, are to be discarded. Or, face the possibility that the usual
“quadratic in E and H” expression for the energy density of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld is not complete. Here, I argue that the latter is the case by providing an
explicit construct for such an indicated modiﬁed expression for the energy density.
Let us recall a generally accepted way to obtain the energy density of the elec-

(cid:1)

tromagnetic ﬁeld in vacuum [6].

In order to obtain the energy density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and the density
of the ﬂux of the electromagnetic energy Landau (see §34, p.76 in [6]) uses two of
Maxwell’s equations:

and

∇ × H =

j +

4π

∂E
∂t

∇ × E = −

Landau multiplies both sides of (5) by E and both sides of (6) by H and combines
the resultant equations:

= −

j · E − (H · [∇ × E] − E · [∇ × H])

(7)

Then, using the well-known formula of vectorial analysis, one obtains:

Then Landau integrates (8) over a volume and applies Gauss’ theorem to the

If the integral, Landau writes further, extends over all space, then the surface
integral vanishes (the ﬁeld is zero at inﬁnity). Then one can express the integral
qv · E over all the charges, and substitute from Eq.(17.7, [6]):

(cid:27)

(11)

Thus, Landau concludes, for the closed system consisting of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld and particles present in it, the quantity in brackets in this equation is conserved.
The second term in this expression is the kinetic energy (including the rest energy
of all particles, of course), the ﬁrst term is consequently the energy of the ﬁeld it
itself. One can therefore call the quantity

w =

E2 + H 2
8π

(12)

the energy density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Obviously that it is impossible to
coordinate such a deﬁnition of the energy density with such a conﬁguration of the
ﬁelds when w is zero in some point while the ﬁelds E and H are not zero at the
same point.

Here however, we have to make two important comments:
1) Landau uses the transition ∂
∂t

(...) → d
dt
any clariﬁcation of this mathematical operation.

R

(...) for a ﬁeld too freely, without

2) Landau states (see [6], §31 ) that the surface integral

S · df vanishes at
inﬁnity because the ﬁeld is zero at inﬁnity. But in this case one implicitly neglects
a radiation ﬁeld which can go oﬀ to inﬁnity. In other words, one cannot do the
transition from (10) to (11) without imposing certain additional conditions, which
prevent this radiation ﬁeld from going oﬀ to inﬁnity. To be more speciﬁc, let us turn
to Landau ([6], §34, ﬁrst footnote): “Here we also assume that the electromagnetic
ﬁeld of the system also vanishes at inﬁnity. This means that, if there is a radiation
of electromagnetic waves by the system, it is assumed that special ‘reﬂecting walls’
prevent these waves from going oﬀ to inﬁnity.”

H

Let us, now turn to our (and Landau’s) formulas (10) and (11):
In classical electrodynamics one assumes that the energy conservation law is an
absolute law and in order to satisfy this law we must, in general, take into account
a possible change of energy of these “reﬂecting walls”, which may take place as a
result of the energy exchange between these “walls” and the system “particles +
ﬁelds”.

But we cannot know a mathematically correct way to take into account this
energy in the formula (11) without exact knowledge of the “nature” of the “reﬂecting
walls.” In this case we cannot obtain an exact energy conservation law using the
concept of the “reﬂecting walls.” In other words in order to obtain the exact energy
conservation law one should not introduce these “walls,” but rather we must assume
S · df does not vanish at inﬁnity. But in this case Eq.(10)
that the surface integral
turns into a trivial equality, which although satisfying the exact energy conservation

H

law, cannot be used to derive any conclusion about the concrete mathematical form
of a energy density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

2. Another form of energy density and its connection with the Oppenheimer-
Ahluwalia zero-energy solutions of the Maxwell equations

However, there is a way to obtain the explicit form of the energy density of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. Let me turn to our (with R.Smirnov-Rueda) papers [7,8] where
we prove that the electromagnetic ﬁeld has to be represented by two independent
parts:

E = E0 + E∗
H = H0 + H∗

= E0(r − rq(t)) + E∗
= H0(r − rq(t)) + H∗

(r, t),

(r, t).

(13)

(14)

Here we note that quasistatic components such as E0 and H0 depend only on the
distance between the point of observation and the source position at the instant of
observation, whereas time-varying-ﬁelds such as E∗ and H∗ depend explicitly on
the point of observation and the time of observation.

Let us now rewrite Eqs. (5) and (6) as formulas (45) and (46) from our afore-

mentioned paper [8]:

∇ × H =

∇ × E = −

where the total time derivative of any vector ﬁeld value E (or H) can be calculated
by the following rule:

here Vi are velocities of the particles at the same instant of observation.b

The mutual independence of the ﬁelds {}0 and {}∗ allows us also to rewrite Eqs.
(15) and (16) (taking into account relations (13), (14) and (17)) as two uncoupled
pairs of diﬀerential equations:

Let us, at last, repeat the calculation of Landau (see above), but now, taking
into account Eqs. (15) and (16) and without imposing the “reﬂecting walls” type
condition.

Let us multiply both sides of (15) by E and both sides of (16) by H and combine

the resultant equations. Then we get:

Let us now extend these integrals over all space and apply Gauss’ theorem to rhs of

vanish at inﬁnity, we obtain:

It is easy to verify, taking into account Eqs. (18) and (19), that the last integral in
(26) and the ﬁrst integral in (25) are equal to each other. Then (25) becomes:

d
dt

(cid:18)Z

(cid:19)

We can therefore call the quantity

2E∗ · E0 + 2H∗ · H0 + E2

0 + H 2
0

w =

8π

the energy density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

Note again that one never can obtain the so called “Oppenheimer-Ahluwalia zero

energy solutions” from the generally accepted form of the electromagnetic energy

w =

E2 + H 2
8π

because for real ﬁelds this quantity is always positive and only can be zero if the
ﬁelds E and H are zero simultaneously.

But from our new representation of the density of this energy

2E∗ · E0 + 2H∗ · H0 + E2

0 + H 2
0

w =

8

it easy to see that the ﬁelds {}∗ and {}0 can have mutually diﬀerent signs because
these ﬁelds {}∗ and {}0 are diﬀerent ﬁelds. It means that we can have the following
relation:

2E∗

· E0 + 2H∗

· H0 < 0

and, in turn, we can have a conﬁguration of non-zero ﬁelds for which w is zero:

2E∗

· E0 + 2H∗

· H0 = −(E2

0 + H 2
0 )

Actually, it is suﬃcient that the ﬁelds {}∗ and {}0 satisfy the equations:

|E∗

| =

−|E0|
2 cos α

and

|H∗

| =

−|H0|
2 cos α

,

where α is an angle between the vectors {}∗ and {}0 with the following limits:

π
2

< α < π +

π
2

.

From the formulas (30) and (31) one also can see that there are negative energy
solutions (compare with the remark (i) after Eq.(4)).

3. Conclusion

In this short note I do not deal with such concepts as the momentum and the angular
momentum of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. And although in this work I use the concept
of the Poynting vector, I do not use the concept of the density of momentum of the
ﬁeld. Let me clarify my point of view:

On the one hand, from generally accepted classical electrodynamics we know
that the Poynting vector is proportional to the density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
momentum. But on the other hand, paradoxes connected with the Poynting vector
if a charge Q is
exist and they are well-known. For example, in our paper [7]:
vibrating in some mechanical way along the X-axis, then the value of w (which is a
point function like |E|) on the same axis will be also oscillating. The question arises:
how does the test charge q at the point of observation, lying at some ﬁxed distance
from the charge Q along the continuation of the X-axis, “know” about the charge Q
vibration? In other words we have a rather strange situation: the Poynting vector
S = c
4π [E × H] is zero along this axis (because H is zero along this line) but the
energy and the momentum, obviously “pass” from point to point along this axis.
This means that we cannot be sure whether using the new deﬁnition of the energy
density will permit use of the old deﬁnition of the momentum density. This problem,
I think, requires very careful research. Other quantities of classical electrodynamics
such as electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor, electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor etc.
can (and perhaps must) also change their physical meanings. In fact, a considerable
number of works have recently been published which directly declare: classical
electrodynamics must be very suﬃciently reconsidered c. To be more speciﬁc, let
me end this paper with the words of R.Feynman who wrote [10]: “...this tremendous
ediﬁce (classical electrodynamics), which is such a beautiful success in explaining
so many phenomena, ultimately falls on its face. When you follow any of our
physics too far, you ﬁnd that it always gets into some kind of trouble. ...the failure
of the classical electromagnetic theory.
...Classical mechanics is a mathematically
consistent theory; it just doesn’t agree with experience. It is interesting, though,
that the classical theory of electromagnetism is an unsatisfactory theory all by itself.
There are diﬃculties associated with the ideas of Maxwell’s theory which are not
solved by and not directly associated with quantum mechanics...”

Abstract

It will be shown that special relativity and Lorentz’s theory are completely identical in
both sense as physical theories and as theories of physical space-time. All statements of special
relativity about those features of reality that correspond to the traditional meaning of terms
“space” and “time” are identical with the statements of Lorentz’s theory. On the other hand,
all statements of Lorentz’s theory about those features of reality that are called “space” and
“time” by special relativity are identical with the statements of special relativity. The only
diﬀerence between the two theories is terminological.

Key words: Lorentz’s theory, special relativity, space-time, operationalism

Introduction

There are basically three ways how people think about the relationship between pre-relativistic
theory of physical space–time and special relativity:

(A) The ﬁrst is the naive approach of some physics textbooks, according to which the emergence
of Einstein’s special relativity is—at least according to the rational reconstruction of the
story—one of the usual discoveries of new facts of nature: Certain experimental ﬁndings
necessitate to draw the conclusion that the geometry of space-time is something diﬀerent
from what we believed before.

(B) According to the second approach, the switch to the relativistic theory of space-time is a
convention, rather than an unambiguous theoretical conclusion drawn from the empirical
facts.1 As we know, Lorentz’s theory is capable to explain the null result of the Michelson–
Morley experiment and other experimental ﬁndings through the deformations of moving
material objects, at the same time, however, it remains completely within the framework of
the classical theory of space and time.
There are various views about the epistemic status of such a choice between Lorentz’s theory
and Einstein’s relativity, as well as there is a variety of (usually erroneous) justiﬁcations of
why we should prefer relativity. Our concern here is the general logical scheme of the
conventionalist approach: There are two theories of space and time, and there are two
corresponding physical theories. In accordance with Poincare’s general thesis that geometry
1Inasmuch as such unambiguous conclusion can be drawn from empirical data at all. The point is, however,

that the known empirical data do not unambiguously imply the denial of the classical theory.

1

and physics only together can be compared with the empirical facts, the conventionalist
thesis asserts the following relationship between these theories:

(Classical space-time)

+ (Lorentz’s theory) = (empirical facts)
(Minkowski’s space-time) + (relativistic physics) = (empirical facts)

(C) According to the third approach, the relation of Lorentz’s theory to Einstein’s special rela-
tivity is the relation of a constructive theory to a corresponding principal theory. J. S. Bell
characterizes this relation as follows:

If you are, for example, quite convinced of the second law of thermodynamics,
of the increase of entropy, there are many things that you can get directly from
the second law which are very diﬃcult to get directly from a detailed study of
the kinetic theory of gases, but you have no excuse for not looking at the kinetic
theory of gases to see how the increase of entropy actually comes about. In the
same way, although Einstein’s theory of special relativity would lead you to expect
the FitzGerald contraction, you are not excused from seeing how the detailed
dynamics of the system also leads to the FitzGerald contractions. (Bell 1992, p.
34)

It is to be mentioned that all of the above three approaches can ﬁnd support in Einstein’s own
writings. Approach (A) can ﬁnd support in Einstein’s famous popular book on special and general
relativity, for example. At the end of Section 13 Einstein regads Fizeau’s experiment as an
“experimentum crucis” in favour of theory of relativity.2 Then the next section begins with the
following summary:

Experienece has led to the conviction that, on the one hand, the principle of rela-
tivity holds true and that on the other hand the velocity of transmission of light in
vacuo has to be considered equal to a constant c. By uniting these two postulates
we obtained the law of transformation for the rectangular co-ordinates x, y, z and the
time t of the events which constitute the process of nature. In this connection we did
not obtained the Galilei transformation, but, diﬀering from classical mechanincs, the
Lorentz transformation. (Einstein 1961, p. 42)

In other writings Einstein seems to agree with the conventionalist approach (B):

Geometry (G) predicates nothing about the relations of real things, but only geometry
together with the purport (P) of physical laws can do so. Using symbols, we may say
that only the sum of (G) + (P) is subject to the control of experience. Thus (G) may
be chosen arbitrarily, and also parts of (P); all these laws are conventions. All that
is necessary to avoid contradictions is to choose the remainder of (P) so that (G) and
the whole of (P) are together in accord with experience. (Einstein 1983, p. 35)

Finally, in some other writings, as H. R. Brown and O. Pooly pointed out in a quite recent paper,3
Einstein claims that special relativity is a principal theory, and that principle theories lose out to
constructive theories in terms of explanatory power:

The universal principle of the special theory of relativity [the relativity principle] ...
is a restricting principle for natural laws, comparable to the restricting principle of
the non-existence of the perpetum mobile which underlies thermodynamics. (Einstein
1969, p. 57)

... when we say we have succeeded in understanding a group of natural processes, we
invariably mean that a constructive theory has been found which covers the processes
in question. (Einstein 1982, p. 228)

My aim in this paper is to show that, contrary to the above three usual approaches, the truth is
that

Thesis Lorentz’s theory and Einstein’s special relativity are completely identical, in both sense,
as physical theories and as theories about space and time.

I shall of course also explain why the two theories seem to be inequivalent on the level of
the narratives. As we will see, the only diﬀerence is that the two theories express the same laws
of physics (including the laws of space-time) in diﬀerent variables— just as we may use polar
or Cartesian coordinates. The confusion is caused by the unfortunate fact that these diﬀerent
variables have the same names in the two theories, namely “space” and “time” coordinates. Thus
the alleged “choice” between special relativity and Lorentz’s theory is merely an inﬂated special
case of a semantical banality holding for any and all linguistic signs or symbols, a banality wich
Grnbaum calls “trivial semantical conventionalism”.4

It is to be noted that although my Thesis deﬁnitely contradicts to the spirit of the three
standard views, it is not in logical contradiction with them. Actually, the complete identity of
Lorentz’s theory and special relativity is the sole case when approaches (A)–(C) are logically
compatible with each other.

1 Lorentz’s Theory

Lorentz’s theory is usually not contained in the physics curricula, hence a brief digression on the
topic may be worthwhile. I shall follow J. S. Bell’s reconstruction in his very clear and concise
review paper, ”How to teach special relativity”.5 Let us ﬁx at the beginning a reference frame K
in which the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Paris, together with the
etalons (the standard measuring rod, the standard clock, etc.) are at rest. The laws of physics,
like the Maxwell equations are understood and valid (empirically tested) in this reference frame.6
It is the familiar spherically
symmetric Coulomb ﬁeld when the particle is at rest (in K). How does this ﬁeld changes when we
set the charge in motion? Maxwell’s equations can also answer this question. Here is the result:
the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a point charge q moving with constant velocity v along the z axis is

Consider now the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a point charge q.

charged particle changes if we set it in motion. What kind of similar deformations do we know,
on the basis of classical pre-relativistic physics?

6At this point my presentation diﬀers from Bell’s paper. Bell—following Lorentz—starts with a reference frame
at rest relative to the aether. From the later results it turns out however that we do not need to operate with the
aether.

Calculate, for example, how this deformation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld modiﬁes the orbit

contraction modiﬁes the period of a light-clock also moving with velocity v along the z axes (see
Fig 3).

7It is an empirical formula also in relativity theory!

From these results we arrive at the conclusion that an arbitrary physical system suﬀers a
deformation if we set it in motion, such that its original extension l0 in the direction of the motion
contracts, 8

One can extend the set of these primed variables with others deﬁnied by the co-moving observer
in K ′ simply repeating the operational deﬁnitions of the similar physical quantities in K, blindly
applying x′, y′, z′, t′—as if they were the space and time coordinates. For example, the electric
ﬁeld strength E in K is deﬁnied as the force on a unite charge at rest:

Therefore we deﬁne E′ as the “force” on a unite charge “at rest” in K ′:

wider if the particle moves with high velocity.

Lorentz has observed that the motion of a physical system modiﬁes its behavior in a peculiar

p

way:

Lorentz principle: The laws describing the behavior of a system in motion can be obtained
in the following way: ﬁrst solve the problem relative to the same system at rest, then, in the
solution thus obtained, perform the substitution

x, y, z, t, E, B, etc. 7→ x′, y′, z′, t′, E

′, B

′, etc.

(7)

In other words, the laws describing the behaviour of the moving system, expressed in the primed
variables, has the same form as the laws describing the same system at rest, expressed in the
original variables. Consequently, the Lorentz principle can be reformulated in the following way:

The laws of physics have the same form in every inertial frame, if they are, from frame to frame,
expressed in terms of diﬀerent physical variables deﬁned by measurements performed with the co-
moving measuring apparatuses, that is, with the same standard measuring apparatuses accelerated
from one inertial frame to the other.

Note that this principle is nothing but the principle of Lorentz covariance in relativistic physics.
Thus, until relativistic physics correctly describes the world, Lorentz’s theory can do the job, too.
10

It is instructive to see in more detail how the things are described by a moving observer. Let

me quote a longer passage from Bell’s above mentioned paper:

The important point to be made about moving observers is this, given Lorentz
invariance: the primed variables, introduced above ... are precisely those which would
naturally be adopted by an observer moving with constant velocity who imagines herself
to be at rest. Moreover, such an observer will ﬁnd that the laws of physics in these
terms are precisely those that she learned when at rest (if she was taught correctly).
Such an observer will naturally take for the origin of space coordinates a point at

rest with respect to herself. This accounts for the vt term in the relation

1 − v2

q

c2 is account for by the Fitzgerald contraction of her metre sticks. But
The factor
will she not see that her metre sticks are contracted when laid out in the z direction—
and even decontract when turned in the x direction? No, because the retina of her eye
will also be contracted, so that just the same cells receive the image of the metre stick
as if both stick and observer were at rest. In the same way she will not notice that her
clocks have slowed down, because she will herself be thinking more slowly. Moreover,
imagining herself to be at rest, she will not know that light overtakes her, or comes to

and the principle of Lorentz covariance are of restricted validity. See Szab 2003.

clocks at diﬀerent places, so that she is led to think that

t′

c2

is the real time, for with this choice light again seems to go with velocity c in all
directions. This can be checked directly, and is also a consequence of the prime Maxwell
equations. In measuring electric ﬁeld she will use a test charge at rest with respect to
her equipment, and so measure actually a combination of E and B. Deﬁning both E
and B by requiring what looks like the familiar eﬀects on moving charged particles,
she will led rather to E′ and B′. Then she will be able to verify that all the laws of
physics are as she remembers, at the same time conﬁrming her own good sense in the
deﬁnitions and procedures that she has adopted. If something does not come out right,
she will ﬁnd that her apparatus is in error (perhaps damaged during acceleration) and
repair it.

Our moving observer O′, imagining herself to be at rest, will imagine that it is the
stationary observer O who moves. And it is as easy to express his variables in terms
of hers as vice versa

Only the sign of v changes. She will say that his metre sticks have contracted, that his
clocks run slow, and that he has not synchronized properly clocks at diﬀerent places.
She will attribute his use of wrong variables to these Fitzgerald–Larmor–Lorentz–
Poincar eﬀects in his equipments. Her will be logically consistent and in perfect accord
with the observable facts. He will have no way of persuading her that she is wrong.11

It is sometimes objected that Lorentz’s theory is unable to account for the Lorentz contraction of
a rod at rest, from the point of view of an observer in motion, since the contraction of a rod at
rest cannot be explained—the objection says—by the deformations of moving objects, described
by Lorentz’s theory.
It is, however, clear from Bell’s above analysis that the contraction of a
rod at rest, observed by an observer in motion, can be very well explained through the physical
deformations of the moving metre sticks and moving clocks of the moving observer.

Now we have completed the illustration of the fact that special relativity theory and Lorentz’s
theory are equivalent with respect to the empirical facts.12 Therefore, it seems, we have to make a
choice between Lorentz’s theory and special relativity. There are many possible ideas behind the
choice of relativity theory.13 Although it is not my concern here to valuate these justiﬁcations, it
may be worthwhile reﬂecting on a couple of common misunderstandings associated with Lorentz’s
theory.

Remark 1 It is a common view that Lorentz’s solution is based on “ad hoc” assumptions of
“the existence of new phenomena”:

So we are ultimately forced to choose between these two types of transformations and
to admit

1. either the continued validity of Newton’s equations and of the Galilean trans-
formation insuring their invariance. In that case, we must, in electrodynamics,
assume the existence of new phenomena which ﬁnd expression in the Lorentz-
Poincar equations, and which insure, by a sort of compensatory phenomenon,
the invariance of the Maxwell equations and the permanently elusive character of
ether.

2. or the universal validity of the Lorentz-Poincar equations. The Lorentz trans-
formation entails the invariance of the Maxwell equations, but it requires the
construction of a kinematics and dynamics that will be in harmony with it. (Ton-
nelat 1966, pp. 127-128)

This is even more sharply formulated in the following quote from Cornelius Lanczos:

The negative eﬀect induced Lorentz to assume that the motion relative to the aether
causes a contraction of lengths in the direction of motion (the Fitzgerald–Lorentz
contraction hypothesis), thus compensating for the eﬀect which would otherwise occur.
(Lanczos 1970, p. 230)

This is however a misinterpretation not only of Lorentz’s theory but also of the relativistic physics.
The contraction in Lorentz’s theory is not ”assumed” but rather derived from the ordinary pre-
relativistic laws of physics; it is not an extra hypothesis of Lorentz’s theory that moving objects
suﬀers deformations just nullifying the otherwise non-zero eﬀect in the Michelson–Morley exper-
iment, as Lanczos and many others suppose it to be, but rather a simple consequence of the
standard pre-relativistic physical theories, like the Maxwellian electrodynamics.

Remark 2 To encounter these deformations, on the other hand, one does not need Lorentz’s
theory. They follow also from the Einsteinian relativistic physics. Many believe, however, that
these deformations in relativity theory are of diﬀerent nature from the similar deformations in
Lorentz’s theory; according to this belief, the Lorentz contraction and the time dilatation in
relativity theory are not real physical processes, but they are just obtained from the comparison
of quantities deﬁned in diﬀerent reference frames.
I will argue, on the contrary, that this is a
misinterpretation of the laws of relativistic physics; the deformation of a moving object in relativity
theory is as real as any other change of a physical system, associated with its motion. It is just as
real as, for example, the change of the electric ﬁeld of a point charge when we set it in motion.

Consider the following physical problem: Imagine a rod at rest in a reference frame K. What
kind of physical processes are going on, according to relativistic physics, when we set the rod
in motion? Does the length of the rod change, for example? According to the general rules
of relativistic physics, one can solve this problem in the following way. Let lK
bef ore = l0 be the
length of the rod in the frame K before we set it in motion. One starts with the assumption
that the laws of physics determining the length of the rod are Lorentz covariant. Consequently,
the length of the moving rod in the co-moving reference frame K ′ is equal to the length of the
rod at rest in the original reference frame at rest, that is, lK ′
af ter = l0. Now we perform a Lorentz
transformation back to the original frame and ﬁnd that the length of the moving rod in the original
frame is lK
bef ore, the rod has contracted. And this is a real
deformation of the rod. The critical point of misunderstanding is that such a question whether
or not the length of the rod has changed can be answered by comparing the earlier length of
the rod with its later length in the same inertial frame . One cannot argue that there is no real
deformation only because there exists some other reference frame K ′ (as it happens, the co-moving
one) such that

Arguing in this way would be as absurd as to say that a rod which is continuously at rest in K
becomes deformed because there is another frame K ′ such that lK ′

6= lK.

8

Remark 3 Another source of confusion is the belief that the Lorentz contraction of a rod is only
a fact of kinematics in relativity theory, unlike Lorentz’s theory, where it is a consequence of a
complex physical reasoning. This belief is, again, based on a misunderstanding of both theories.

(i) It is neither in relativity nor in Lorentz’s theory true that the Lorentz contraction of a rod
simply derives from the rules of kinematics. To be sure, it is a fact of relativistic kinematics
that lK
c2 , as a simple consequence of the Lorentz transformation. But, it
is a contingent physical assertion, an empirically conﬁrmed fact of nature, that the dynamics
of the constituents of the rod—determining its length—is Lorentz covariant (the Lagrangian
of the whole system is Lorentz invariant), that is, lK ′

af ter = lK

′

(ii) In Lorentz’s theory, too, with the assumption that the physical laws determining the length
of the rod satisfy the Lorentz principle, one can calculate the contracted length of the rod
in the same simple way as in relativity theory.

(iii) On the other hand, also in relativistic physics one can perform the calculation in the reference
frame at rest, by directly applying the laws of (relativistic) physics to the moving object.
The procedure is analogous (and as complex as) the one within the framework of Lorentz’s
theory.

Let me illustrate (ii) and (iii) by a more familiar textbook example: What is the electric ﬁeld of
a point charge moving with constant velocity? There are two methods to answer this question:

1. Consider the Coulomb ﬁeld of a charged point particle at rest. It follows from the Lorentz
(covariance) principle that the electric ﬁeld of the moving source in the co-moving reference
frame is also the Coulomb ﬁeld. One can then perform a Lorentz transformation from the
co-moving frame back to the reference frame at rest.14

2. One can directly solve the Maxwell equations in case of a moving point charge. First one
solves the Maxwell equations for arbitrary time-depending sources. Then, from the retarded
potentials thus obtained, one derives the Lienart–Wiechert potentials, from which one can
determine the electric ﬁeld.15

Both solutions lead to the same result: the electric ﬁeld of a charged point particle changes if we
set the particle in motion. Due to this change, for example, the track of a charged particle in a
bubble chamber becomes wider if the particle moves with higher velocity. The widening of the
track is a real, observable physical phenomenon. The change of the electric ﬁeld is a real physical
change.

Remark 4 Sometimes in the philosophy of science literature, the choice between Lorentz’s the-
ory and special relativity is regarded as a typical example for the choice, governed by external
factors, between empirically under-determined scientiﬁc theories. For example, Michael Friedman,
admitting that the two theories are empirically equivalent, claims that “there is a stage in the
evolution of theory ... at which methodological criteria do play a role, namely the elimination of
the Lorentz–FitzGerald-type ’aether’ theory”. So, on the basis of the methodological principle of
parsimony, he ends up with special relativity.16 We must however emphasize that neither special
relativity nor Lorentz’s theory needs to suppose the existence of aether, and none of them excludes
its existence. As we have seen, Lorentz’s theory can be formulated without even mentioning the
aether.

Remark 5 With regard to approach (C), it is to be mentioned that, in ﬁnal analysis, there is
no diﬀerence between the two theories whether they are used as “principle theories” or as more
detailed “constructive” descriptions. So the analogy with phenomenological thermodynamics does
not hold: It is, indeed, impossible to describe the detailed dynamics of the 1023 molecules of a gas
in the terms of phenomenological thermodynamics. But, relativistic physics is capable to describe
the behaviour of the constituents of a solid body, describing in this way how the detailed dynamics
of the system leads to the Lorentz–FitzGerald contractions.

After this digression on how people usually justify the choice between Lorentz’s theory and
special relativity, return to my main Thesis that there is actually no such a choice: The two
theories are completely identical.

Identity of special relativity and Lorentz’s theory

Let me ﬁrst formulate an erroneous version of Poincar’s conventionalist schema for relativity:

However, as I pointed out in Remark 2, there is no such a “beneﬁt” of switching from the classical
space-time to Minkowski’s space-time. All physical deformations of moving objects are still exist
in relativity theory, too. So the conventionalist schema does not express the correct relation of
special relativity and Lorentz’s theory! The correct relationship would be this:

How is it possible? No doubt—many argue—, special relativity and Lorentz’s theory describe the
same observable physical phenomena, but they are diﬀerent theories, because they account for the
geometry of space-time diﬀerently. That is, the same phenomena are described by them in two
diﬀerent ways. For example,

(S1) Velocity is an additive quantity in the Lorentz theory, but this is not true in relativity theory.

(S2) The speed of light is the same in diﬀerent inertial frames in relativity, but this is not so in

Lorentz’s theory.

true in relativity theory.

(S3) Simultaneity is the same in all reference frame, according to Lorentz’s theory, but this is not

However, that is not the case. The three above sentences, for example, are false. As we will see,
they are false in the same trivial sense as if someone were confused with the British and American
usage of the word “billion”. The truth is—as my main Thesis claims—that the two theories are
completely identical in both sense, as physical theories and as theories about space and time.

When can we say that two theories are identical? Two physical theories are deﬁnitely identical
if they assert the same things about all physical quantities, that is, if they assign the same numbers

(9)

to all physical quantities with respect to all physical objects, and they claim the same functional
relations between these values. So, if sentence (S1) were true, the two theories could not be
identical. However, to compare two propositions of two diﬀerent theories about physical quantities,
one has to clarify, ﬁrst of all, whether the propositions are about the same quantities, or not.
And here we arrive at an essential point: the meaning of the terms “space coordinate”, “time
coordinate”, “velocity”, etc. are diﬀerent in Lorentz’s theory and relativity theory. In sentence
(S1) the term “velocity” refers to diﬀerent physical quantities in Lorentz’s theory and in special
relativity.17

So let us start with clarifying these empirical deﬁnitions. We are interested in the space and
time coordinates deﬁned in a reference frame at rest relative to the International Bureau of Weights
and Measures (BIPM) in Paris K, and the same quantities deﬁned in a frame K ′ moving with
velocity v relative to K—according to Lorentz’s theory and special relativity. For the sake of
simplicity consider only one space dimension and assume that the origin of both K and K ′ is at
BIPM at the initial moment of time.

Empirical deﬁnitions

(D1) Time at the origin in K according to Lorentz’s theory

where τ is the reading of the standard clock at rest in the BIPM.

tK := τ

(D2) Space and time coordinates in K according to Lorentz’s theory18

Assume we sent a light signal at time tK
1 from the origin of K (i. e., from the BIPM)
to the location of event A such that the signal arrived just when A occured. Then, at
the moment of A, we sent back a light signal to the origin, which arrived at time tK
2 .
We deﬁne the time and space coordinates of the event A as follows:

tK(A)

c

(The value of c, say 299792458 m
should be deﬁned through a standard meter stick or the like.)

s is a convention in this approach—otherwise distance

(D3) Time at the origin in K according to special relativity

where τ is the reading of the standard clock at rest in the BIPM.

17When I claim that “velocity” in the two theories is not the same physical quantity, I mean something entirely
diﬀerent from the incommensurability thesis of the relativist philosophy of science (see Kuhn 1970, Chapter X;
Feyerabend 1970). As we will see later, both velocityLorentz and velocityrelativity are meaningful physical quantities
in both theories, and they are commensurable.

Therefore, diﬀerent physical quantities are called “space coordinate”, and similarly, diﬀerent phys-

Remark 7 Notice that the operations in deﬁnitions (D6) and (D7) are the blind repetitions of
the operations in deﬁnitions (D1) and (D2), simply ignoring the fact that a clock suﬀers a loss
of phase when moving. This is obvious in case of (D6). In addition, the light signal deﬁnition
of simultaneity in (D7) has the same background: Let us calculate the reading of a clock slowly
transported in K ′ from the origin to the locus of an event A. The clock is moving with a varying
velocity20

C (tK) = v + wK (tK)
vK
where wK (tK) is the velocity of the clock relative to K ′, that is, wK (0) = 0 when it starts at
C (0) = 0 (we assume that the origins of K and K ′ coincide at tK = 0) and wK (tK
xK
1 ) = 0 when
the clock arrives at the place of A. The reading of the clock at the time tK

1 will be

Since wK is small we may develop in powers of wK, and we ﬁnd from (14) when neglecting terms
of second and higher order

Thus the reading of the clock slowly transported to the place of event A diﬀers from tK(A) because
of the loss of phase accumulated by the clock during its journey. From the comparison of (15) and
19This was ﬁrst recognized by Bridgeman (Bridgman 1927, p. 12), although he did not investigated the further

consequences of this fact.

20For the sake of simplicity we continue to restrict our calculation to the case of one space dimension. For the

general calculation of the phase shift suﬀered by moving clocks, see Jnossy 1971, pp. 142–147.

(A), deﬁned in (D7), is equal to the reading T . In other words, deﬁnition
(17) we can see that
(D7) assigns a time tag to event A equal to the “time” measured with the slowly transported
clock, neglecting the fact that the clock in question is not only slowed down but also having a
phase shift, relative to the standard clock at rest in the BIPM.

(A) is nothing but the “distance” of the
set it in motion. Indeed, one can easily show that
locus of A from the origin of K ′, measured by a co-moving, therefore contracted, meter stick.
And, of course, if we measure the distance and time in K ′ using the contracted meter stick and
the distorted clock, but disregard these distortions of the equipments, then we ﬁnd the “speed of
light” to be equal to c.

xK ′

Remark 8 In deﬁnition (D5), on the contrary, the distortions suﬀered by the etalon measuring
equipments when they are set in motion are taken into account. That is why we deﬁne the space
and time tags in K ′through the original space and time data, measured by the original distortion
free equipments, being at rest relative to the BIPM. It is easy to see, that one would ﬁnd the same
xK(A) and tK(A) if the space and time tags were measured with the co-moving equipments, but,
with compensations of the distortions—according to our classical intuition. So, the basic diﬀerence
between the deﬁnitions according to the two theories is that in Lorentz’s theory the deformations
of the moving measuring apparatuses are taken into account, while these deformations are ignored
in the deﬁnitions according to special relativity.

Remark 9 We note that if v = 0 in (15) then T = tK(A), that conﬁrms the deﬁnition (D2)
with the help of light signals in the reference frame at rest relative to the BIPM.

Remark 10 Due to the popular/textbook literature on relativity theory, there is a widespread
aversion to a privileged reference frame. However, like it or not, there exists a privileged reference
frame in both special relativity and Lorentz’s theory. It is the frame of reference in which the
International Bureau of Weights and Measures is at rest. To be sure, it is not privileged by
nature. But it is privileged by the trivial semantical convention providing meanings for the terms
“distance” and “time”, by the fact that from all possible measure sticks and clocks of the universe
we have chosen as the etalons the ones ﬂoating together with the International Bureau of Weights
and Measures in Paris.

Many believe that one can avoid the reference to the etalons of a privileged frame by deﬁning,
for example, the unit of time for an arbitrary (moving) frame of reference K ′—in the sense of
deﬁnition (D6)—through a cesium clock, or the like, co-moving with K ′. That is not the case,
however. Such a deﬁnition has several tacit assumptions like that the diﬀerent cesium clocks go
uniformly and that the laws governing the behaviour of the cesium clocks are Lorentz covariant,
etc. The validity of such contingent statements cannot be empirically tested without comparing
the readings of the diﬀerent cesium clocks with one etalon clock.

Now we are ready to prove that Lorentz’s theory and special relativity are identical descriptions
, tK ′
of space and time. In order to see this identity, consider how special relativity describes xK ′
and, on the other hand, how Lorentz’s theory accounts for
. In such a comparison we
can utilize the operational identities (10) and (11), and we can express everything through, say,
xK and tK. Let A be an arbitrary event.

Consequently, there is no diﬀerence in how the two theories account for the “velocities”:

space for space, with two independent invariant metrics corresponding to the time and space

Concluding remarks

’What is time and what is space?’ is a metaphysical question par excellence. There is no deﬁnite
answer to the question ’What kind of physical quantities can adequately represent the various
aspects of time and space perceptions?’ For physics, however, time and space (distance) are
ordinary—although fundamental—physical quantities with deﬁnite empirical meaning. As we
have seen the meaning of the terms “space coordinate”, “time coordinate”, “velocity”, etc. are
diﬀerent in Lorentz’s theory and special relativity.

Having clariﬁed the meaning of the terms, it turned out that the two theories are identical. In
other words, it is not the case that special relativity claims something new about space-time—in
comparison with the pre-relativistic Galileo-invariant conceptions of space and time—, but simply
calls something else “space-time”, and that something else has diﬀerent properties. All statements

16

of special relativity about those features of reality that correspond to the traditional meaning of
the terms “space” and “time” are identical with the traditional pre-relativistic statements. On
the other hand, all statements of the pre-relativistic theory about those features of reality that
are called “space” and “time” by special relativity are identical with the statements of special
relativity. Thus the birth of special relativity was a terminological turn, rather than a revolution
in our conception of space and time.

1 Introduction

The uniformly accelerated spherical coordinates have been introduced in our
work [1]. It turns out that the Newman-Penrose method of isotropic complex
tetrade [2] works in this coordinate system. The aim of the present work is
to demonstrate applying the method in the coordinate system and obtain
the general solution to Maxwell equations in these coordinates.

Although a comprehnsive formulation of the method have been pub-
lished [3], in order to apply it in a new coordinate system we have to start
with composing the tetrade and thus to repeat the whole exposition. Thus,
the method is to be actually recovered in details.

2 The isotropic complex tetrade

The metric for the uniformly accelerated spherical coordinates {ξ, u, v, ϕ}
has the form [1]

ds2 = a2 sinh2 udξ2 − du2 − dv2 − sin2 vdϕ2

.

(cosh u + cos v)2

(1)

To compose the isotropic complex tetrade we ﬁrst solve the Hamolton-Jacobi
equation for isotropic lines in this metric:

Substituting S = Eξ + U(u) + V (v) + Mϕ yields a separated equation:



E2 sinh

−2 u − U ′2 = V ′2 − M 2 sin−2 = L2.

The two congruences of isotropic rays to be used below for composing
the tetrade corresponds to the values E = 1, L = M = 0 and M = 1, L =
E = 0 of the constants. They give respectively

and

U ′ = ± sinh

−1 u, V ′ = 0

U ′ = 0, V ′ = ±ı sin−1 v.

The isotropic co-vectors with these two congruences are normalized with
respect to the metric

ds2 = a2(sinh2 udξ2 − du2 − dv2 − sin2 vdϕ2)

obtained from the metric (1) by an apparent conformal transformation. It
is convenient to do so because Maxwell equations are forminvariant under

conformal transormations. After the normalization procedure the tetrade
appears in the form:

κ = sinh udξ − du, λ = sinh udξ + du

(2)

µ = dv + ı sin vdϕ, ν = dv − ı sin vdϕ

The co-vectors constitute a normalized orthogonal frame with only two non-
zero scalar products:< κ, λ >=< µ, ν >= 1. The reciprocal relations are:

dξ =

κ + λ

, du =

λ − κ

The vector frame dual to the co-vector frame (1) is the following:

Consider the following 2-forms Φ1, Φ2, Φ3:

(3)

(4)

Φ1 = κ ∧ µ, Φ2 =

(κ ∧ λ + µ ∧ ν), Φ3 = λ ∧ ν

(5)

2

Evaluating them due to the relations (2) gives:

Φ1 = sinh udξ ∧ dv + ı sinh u sin vdξ ∧ dϕ − du ∧ dv + ı sin vdϕ ∧ du

(6)

Φ2 = sinh udξ ∧ du − ı sin vdv ∧ dϕ
Φ3 = sinh udξ ∧ dv − ı sinh u sin vdξ ∧ dϕ + du ∧ dv + ı sin vdϕ ∧ du

It is seen that the frame of 2-forms {Φa} is self-dual:

∗Φa = ıΦa.

(7)

As these three 2-forms are linearly independent they constitute a complete
frame.

Exterior derivatives of Φa’s evaluated from the equations (5) with
inserting the expressions (3) and rewritten in terms of the tetrade (1) and
the frame {Φa}’ are:

dΦ1 =

coth uλ ∧ Φ1 + cot vν ∧ Φ1, dΦ2 = 0

(8)

dΦ3 = −

coth uκ ∧ Φ3 + cot vµ ∧ Φ3.

3 Reduction of Maxwell equations

An arbitrary 2-form of strengths of electromagnetic ﬁeld E can be represented
as a expansion in the frame of Φa’s:

E = F Φ1 + GΦ2 + HΦ3

(9)

with F , G and H being arbitrary scalar functions. Since, due to the equations
(7) the 2-form E is self-dual Maxwell equations are reduced to one equation
dE = 0:

0 = dE = (~l ◦ F )λ ∧Φ1 + (~n ◦ F )ν ∧Φ1 + (~k ◦ H)κ∧Φ3 + ( ~m◦ H)µ ∧Φ3+ (10)

(~k ◦ G)κ ∧ Φ2 + (~l ◦ G)λ ∧ Φ2( ~m ◦ G)µ ∧ Φ2 + (~n ◦ G)ν ∧ Φ2 + F dΦ1 + HdΦ3

where action of vectors on scalars is the same as that of diﬀerential operators
(4). It is convenient to employ ambiguity of expression of 3-forms as exterior
products of the tetrade elements and Φa’s to eliminate the 2-form Φ2:

κ ∧ Φ2 =

ν ∧ Φ1, λ ∧ Φ2 = −

µ ∧ Φ3,

µ ∧ Φ2 = −

λ ∧ Φ1, ν ∧ Φ2 =

κ ∧ Φ3.

After eliminating 3-forms containing Φ2, colleting similar terms, in-
serting the expressions (8) and annulating the common factors one can rewrite
the equation (10) in the form

4 Variables separation and explicit form of

the scalar functions

The equations (11) reduce to the following equation for the functions f±:

f± = 0.

Taking the function to be found in factorized form

f± = U±(u)V±(v)

(13)

Substituting this separates the equation and gives:

± + U ′
U ′′

± coth u +

= l(l + 1)U±

± + V ′
V ′′

± cot v −

m2 ± m cos v + 1
sin2 v

= −l(l + 1)V±.

Solutions of these equations are known as spin 1 spherical harmonics [3]:

U±(u) = 1Sl

ık(u) V±(v) = 1Slm(v).

Due to the equations (11) the function g is

g(u, v) =

+ coth u ±

ık(u)

1Slm(v).

Substituting this into the equations (13) and, further, into equations (11)
together with the equations (9) and (6) one obtains patricular solutions of
Maxwell equations, forming a complete orthogonal basis in the functional
space. In the case m = 0 one obtains the expansion found in our work [1].

Electromagnetic Waves in the Vacuum with Torsion and Spin.

R. M. Kiehn
Physics Department, University of Houston, Houston, TX, 77004

Exact radiative wave solutions to the classical homogeneous
Maxwell equations in the vacuum have been found that are not
transverse, exhibit both torsion and spin, and for which the second
Poincare invariant E ◦ B 6= 0. Two four component rank 3 tensors
of spin current and torsion are constructed on topological grounds.
The divergence of each pseudo vector generates the Poincare invari-
ants of the electromagnetic system.

0. Introduction

In section 1 the domain of classical electromagnetism is deﬁned in terms
of four vector ﬁelds D, E, B, H, and the vector and scalar potentials {A, φ}. In
section 2 prior attempts to ﬁnd time dependent wave solutions with non-zero
Poincare invariants are discussed brieﬂy, with special emphasis placed upon
Ranada’s use of the Hopf map.
In section 3, several time dependent closed
form solutions are presented that have E ◦ B 6= 0.

1. The Domain of Classical Electromagnetism

In terms of the notation and the language of Sommerfeld and Stratton
[1], the classic deﬁnition of an electromagnetic system is a domain of space-time
independent variables, {x, y, z, t}, which supports both the Maxwell-Faraday
equations,

curl E + ∂B/∂t = 0,

div B = 0,

and the Maxwell-Ampere equations,

curl H − ∂D/∂t = J,

div D = ρ.

(1.1)

(1.2)

For the Lorentz vacuum state, the charge-current densities are subsumed to
be zero [J, ρ] = 0 and the ﬁeld excitations, D and H, are linearly connected
to the ﬁeld intensities, E and B, by means of the homogeneous and isotropic
constitutive relations D = εE , B = µH.
It is further subsumed that the
classic Maxwell electromagnetic system is constrained by the statement that
the ﬁeld intensities are deducible from a system of twice diﬀerentiable potentials,
[A, φ]:

1

B = curl A, E = −grad φ − ∂A/∂t.

(1.3)

This constraint topologically implies that domains that support non-zero values
for the covariant ﬁeld intensities, E and B, can not be compact domains without
a boundary, unless the domain has Euler characteristic zero. The only two
exceptions are therefore the Torus and the Klein bottle.

Besides the charge current 4-vector density, [J, ρ], whose integral over
any closed 3 dimensional manifold is a deformation invariant of the Maxwell
system, there exist two other algebraic combinations of the ﬁelds and potentials
that can lead to similar topological quantities. These objects are the rank 3
Spin (pseudo) vector, or current [2], deﬁned in component form as

S4 = [A × H + Dφ, A ◦ D] ≡ [S,σ],

and the rank 3 Torsion (pseudo) vector [3] deﬁned in component form as

T4 = [E × A + Bφ, A ◦ B] ≡ [T,h].

Note that the classical helicity, h = A ◦ B, forms only the fourth component of
this third rank tensor. The derivation of these 4-component tensor ﬁelds of rank
3 and their topological implications are developed in more detail elsewhere.[4]
The 4-divergence of these 4-component vectors leads to the Poincare projective
invariants of the Maxwell system:

(1.4)

(1.5)

P oincare Invariant 1 = div3(A × H + Dφ) + ∂(A ◦ D)/∂t

(1.6)

= (B ◦ H − D ◦ E) − (A ◦ J − ρφ)

P oincare Invariant 2 = div3(E × A + Bφ) + ∂(A ◦ B)/∂t
= −2E ◦ B

(1.7)

When the Spin vector is non-zero, and its 4-divergence (the ﬁrst Poincare
invariant) vanishes, integrals over closed three manifolds of the Spin 4 vector
lead a topological property equivalent to a deRham period integral [5]:

Spin = RRR
closed

{Sxdyˆdzˆdt − Sydxˆdzˆdt + Szdxˆdyˆdt − σdxˆdyˆdz}.

(1.8)

This closed integral is a deformation invariant of any evolutionary process that
can be described by a singly parameterized vector ﬁeld, βV, independent of the
choice of parameterization, β, for the Lie derivative of the Spin integral vanishes:

2

L(βV) Spin = 0.

(1.9)

When the associated Poincare invariant vanishes, the values of the Spin integral
Similar statements hold for the closed integrals of the
form rational ratios.
Torsion vector.

2. Earlier Work

In earlier articles, Chu and Ohkawa [6] developed a standing wave ex-
ample that led Khare and Pradhan [7] to construct a free space electromagnetic
wave which had non-zero Poincare Invariants. Braunstein [8] mentioned that
these developments were technically ﬂawed and further argued that the exis-
tence of a bonaﬁde (spatially bounded) electromagnetic wave in free space with
non-zero Poincare invariants was impossible.

The solution counter examples to Braunstein’s claim, as given in section
3 below, were inspired by the work of Ranada [9] who investigated the applica-
tions of the Hopf map to the problem of ﬁnding knotted solutions to the Maxwell
equations. Recall that the Hopf map can be written as the common constraint
on the map Φ from R4(x, y, z, s) to R3(X, Y, Z) given by the expressions:

[X, Y, Z] = [2(ys − xz) , −2(yz + xs) , −(z2 + s2) + (x2 + y2)]

(2.1)

From another point of view, the Hopf map deﬁnes a family of cyclides in

{x, y, z} parameterized by s

Hopf M ap Cyclide

r4 + (2s2 − 1)r2 + s4 = 0,

(2.2)

and where r2 = x2 + y2 + z2. A picture of the Hopf cyclide can be seen in
reference [10].

Ranada suggested the 4-potential (based on the Hopf map for s = 1)

A = [y, −x, −1](2/π)/λ4 , φ = 0/λ4, where λ2 = 1 + x2 + y2 + z2,

(2.3)

which will generate the ﬁelds

E = [0, 0, 0]

B = [−2(y + zx), +2(x − yz), +(−1 + x2 + y2 − z2)](4/π)/λ6.
(2.4)
Note that the components of the induced B ﬁeld are precisely the coeﬃcients
of the Hopf Map (to within a factor). Ranada discusses the knottedness of the
magnetic ﬁeld lines of such solutions to the Maxwell-Faraday equations, which
have ﬁnite helicity, but zero second Poincare invariant.

3

h = A ◦ B = −8s/π2λ8 ,

E ◦ B = 0 .

(2.5)

Unfortunately, the Ranada 4-potential does not satisfy the Maxwell-Ampere
equation for the vacuum with a zero charge current 4-vector, and therefore is
not a suitable vacuum solution.

Consider a modiﬁcation of the Hopf map by substituting s ⇒ ict to yield

the modiﬁed time dependent potentials:

A = [y, −x, +ict](2/π)/λ4 , φ = icz/λ4, where λ2 = −(ct)2 + x2 + y2 + z2.
(2.6)
Such potentials lead to complex E and B ﬁelds that indeed satisfy (subject to
the phase condition εµc2 = 1) the zero charge current criteria for a vacuum so-
lution, and the vector wave equation. However, the second Poincare invariant
is imaginary and the Poynting vector vanishes for such solutions. The Spin
vector, on the other hand, is real and has non-zero divergence.

3. Example Radiative Vacuum Solutions for which E ◦ B 6= 0.
The modiﬁcations of the Hopf map further suggest consideration of the sys-

tem of potentials given by the equations

A = [+y, −x, −ct]/λ4 , φ = cz/λ4, where λ2 = −c2t2 + x2 + y2 + z2. (3.1)

which yield the real ﬁeld intensities,

E = [−2(cty − xz), +2(ctx + yz), −(c2t2 + x2 + y2 − z2)]2c/λ6

(3.2)

and

B = [−2(cty + xz), +2(ctx − yz), +(c2t2 + x2 + y2 − z2)]2/λ6.

(3.3)

Subject to the dispersion relation, εµc2 = 1 and the Lorentz constitutive con-
ditions, these time dependent wave functions satisfy the homogeneous Maxwell
equations without charge currents, and are therefore acceptable vacuum solu-
tions. The extensive algebra involved in these and other computations in this
article were checked with a Maple symbolic mathematics program [11].

The Spin current density for this ﬁrst non-transverse wave example is

evaluated as:

S4 = [x(3λ2−4y2−4x2), y(3λ2−4y2−4x2), z(λ2−4y2−4x2), t(λ2−4y2−4x2)](2/µ)/λ10,

(3.4)

4

and has zero divergence. The Torsion current may be evaluated as

and has a non-zero divergence equal to the second Poincare invariant

T4 = −[x, y, z, t]2c/λ8.

P oincare 2 = −2E ◦ B = +8c/λ8.

As the ﬁrst Poincare invariant is zero it is possible to construct a defor-
mation invariant in terms of the deRham period integral of the Spin current 4
vector over a closed 3 dimensional submanifold.

It is to be noted that the example solution given above is but one of a
class of vacuum wave solutions that have similar non transverse properties. As a
second example, consider the ﬁelds that can be constructed from the potentials,

(3.5)

(3.6)

A = [+ct, −z, +y]/λ4 , φ = cx/λ4, where λ2 = −c2t2 + x2 + y2 + z2. (3.7)

These potentials will generate the ﬁeld intensities

E = [+(−c2t2 + x2 − y2 − z2), +2(ctz + yx), −2(cty − zx)]2c/λ6

(3.8)

and

B = [+(−c2t2 + x2 − y2 − z2), +2(−ctz + yx), +2(cty + zx)]2/λ6.

(3.9)

As before, these ﬁelds satisfy the Maxwell-Faraday equations, and the associated
excitations satisfy the Maxwell-Ampere equations without producing a charge
current 4-vector. However, it follows by direct computation that the second
Poincare invariant, and the Torsion 4-vector are of opposite signs to the values
computed for the ﬁrst example:

T4 = +[x, y, z, t]2c/λ8 ,

−2E ◦ B = −8c/λ8 .

(3.10)

When the two examples are combined by addition (or subtraction), the re-
sulting wave is transverse magnetic (in the topological sense that A ◦ B = 0).
Not only does the second Poincare invariant vanish under superposition, but
so also does the Torsion 4 vector. Conversely, the examples above show that
there can exist transverse magnetic waves which can be decomposed into two
non-transverse waves. A notable feature of the superposed solutions is that
the Spin 4 vector current does not vanish, hence the example superposition is a
wave that is not transverse electric (A ◦ D 6= 0). For the examples presented
above and their superposition, the ﬁrst Poincare invariant vanishes, which im-
plies that the Spin integral remains a conserved topological quantity for the

5

superposition, with values proportional to the integers. The Spin current den-
sity for the combined examples is given by the formula:

S4 = [−2x(y + ct)2, (y + ct)(x2 − y2 + z2 − 2cty − c2t2), −2z(y + ct)2,

−(y + ct)(x2 + y2 + z2 + 2cty + c2t2)](4/µ)/λ10,

(3.11)

while the Torsion current is a zero vector

T4 = [0, 0, 0, 0].

(3.12)

In addition, for the superposed example, the spatial components of the
Poynting vector are equal to the Spin current density vector multiplied by γ,
such that

E × H = γ S, with γ = −(x2 + y2 + z2 + 2cty + c2t2)/2c(y + ct)λ2. (3.13)

These results seem to give classical credence to the Planck assumption that
vacuum state of Maxwell’s electrodynamics supports quantized angular mo-
mentum, and that the energy ﬂux must come in multiples of the spin quanta.
In other words, these combined solutions to classical electrodynamics have some
of the qualities of the photon.

Radiation reaction is revisited, ﬁrst in a new classical aproach, where the physical particle 4-momentum is
redeﬁned as the energy-momentum ﬂux across the future light cone and is not parallel to the 4-velocity.
Then in a semi-classical approach, it is shown that, when emitting a photon, the particle ”side-slips”
transversaly to its initial momentum, justifying the non-colinearity between momentum and mean velocity.
Side-slipping is ﬁnally checked in a pure quantum mechanical treatment of synchrotron radiation.

The ”mad electron”.

Although mathematically elegant, the ALD equa-
tion is not physically acceptable for the following rea-
sons :

* a third initial condition ¨X(0) is needed in addi-

tion to X(0) and ˙X(0).

(2)

* for almost every ¨X(0), the electron eventually

goes into a run-away motion.

* given X(0) and ˙X(0), there may exist one (or
a discrete set of) ¨X(0) such that the electron avoids
run-away motion, but this value depends on all the
ﬁelds Fin(X) that the electron will encounter in the
future. Saying that ”nature precisely chooses this
¨X(0)” constitutes a violation of the causality princi-
ple.

One may compare this situation with the following
one : In a bus, a passenger puts a stick vertical on
the ﬂoor and wants it to remain standing up in equi-
librium during the whole journey, and also after the
bus has stopped. To counter-act the accelerations of
the bus, he or she must give some initial angular ve-
locity to the stick (Fig.1). To do so, the passenger
must know exactly in advance the accelerations of the
vehicle during the whole journey.

The run-away instability is probably related to the
point-like limit of the classical electron considered by
Lorentz : For a suﬃciently small radius, the elec-
trostatic self-energy is larger than the physical mass.
Then the electron ”core” has a negative mass and
”likes” to accelerate, since that lowers its kinetic en-
ergy.

It is possible to ﬁnd approximations of the ALD
equation, valid to ﬁrst order in αcl, which remove the
arbitrariness of ¨X(0) and have no run-away solutions.

Eqs.(1’) and (7b) make the instantaneous conserva-

features are not physically damning. (6) can be ap-

one or any linear combination of the two. Looking
at the ﬁrst decomposition of Eq.(4), we choose the
retarded ﬁeld. So we consider that the incoming ﬁeld
does not contribute to the self 4-momentum and only
exerts a force on the core according to the ﬁrst term
of (3). As hyper-surface Σ we a priori choose the
future light cone of the electron (Fig.2). This avoids

does not cross it.

Let us consider a point X µ(τ0) of the electron world
line. For a space-time point Y µ of its future light
cone, we deﬁne

The second expression is Lorentz invariant and ap-
plies as well in frames where the electron is not at
rest. Note that the acceleration does not enter this
formula. It conﬁrms that there is no contribution of
the radiated ﬁeld.

The integral diverges at r = 0, recalling that the
classical self-energy of a point-like charge is inﬁnite.
In the following, we will assume that the electron has
some very small but ﬁnite extension rc. To treat the
divergence, we truncate the light cone by a hyper-
plane orthogonal to the electron world line at X(τ )
where τ
τ0 = ρ is a small distance, but larger than
rc (Fig.3). We now take the rest frame of the elec-
tron at X(τ ) (not τ0). We close the cone, truncated
ρ, by the piece of hyperplane R0 = ρ,
at r

and integrate (9) on the new hypersurface (in grey

Let us make the energy-momentum balance in the
space-time region between two successive ”ﬂower-
pots” at proper times τ and τ + dτ :

* P (τ ) is coming through the ﬁrst ﬂower-pot,
* dPin = e Fin ˙X dτ is brought to the core by Fin,
¨X) ˙X dτ is radiated at inﬁnity
* dPrad = 2

3 αcl ( ¨X

between the two ﬂower-pots,

·

* P (τ + dτ ) = P (τ ) + ˙P dτ is outgoing through the

second ﬂower-pot.
Adding the ﬁrst two quantities and subtracting the
last two ones must give zero. This gives (7b).

The above calculations constitute a new and rela-
tively simple derivation of the ALD equation, written
in the form (7). From this form on can derive new
types of approximations [3-5], also valid to ﬁrst order
in αcl. The simplest one to implement in a computer
code is obtained replacing ¨X in the right-hand sides
by (e/m2) F P . On may in addition replace the last
˙X by P/m. Compared to (5), these approximations
have the advantage of not involving the ﬁeld deriva-
tives.

3. SEMI-CLASSICAL APPROACH

Eq.(6) tells that the momentum does not follow
the velocity, but one may see things the other way
around and say that the electron does not follows the
direction of its momentum. We call this phenomenon
side-slipping, by analogy with a skier whose track is
not always tangential to the skis (Fig.4)

A discrete side-slipping is naturally obtained in a
semi-classical description of the process e−
e′− +
photon in an external ﬁeld. If we consider this process
as instantaneous and local at a deﬁnite point X of the

≡

√P2 + m2. However, 4-momentum conser-

vation becomes possible if we assume that the ﬁnal
electron trajectory starts from a point X′

from the initial trajectory.
In the case of a static
electric ﬁeld, we replace (17) by

U (X) + ǫ = U (X′) + ǫ′ + ¯hω

Side-slipping was deduced above from semi-
classical arguments of energy, momentum and an-
gular momentum conservation. Here we will derive
side-slipping from a full quantum treatment, in the
particular case of synchrotron radiation. Neglecting
electron spin, we start from the Klein-Gordon equa-
tion (now ¯h = 1),

classical derivation of the side-slipping.

5. CONCLUSION

In this study, we have got new insight in the radia-
tion mechanism. Using purely classical, semi-classical
and quantum-mechanical approaches, we have shown
that the velocity and the properly deﬁned momen-
tum of the radiating particle are not parallel, as il-
lustrated in Fig.6. The classical run-away problem
still remains unsolved, but we have obtained a new
approximation of the ALD equation, without run-
away and not involving the ﬁeld derivatives. It can
be easily implemented on a computer code.

The discrete side-slipping accompanying the emis-
sion of a photon is of the order of the comptom wave-
length, hence hardly detectable. However its con-
tribution to the decrease of the transverse energy

of a high-energy electron channeled in crystals may
be non-negligible. The ”side-slipping of the photon”
(27), much larger than the electron one, may be ob-
served with precise optics.

The transverse jumping of the particle from the
initial to the ﬁnal trajectory has no classical coun-
terpart. It can be viewed as a tunnel eﬀect. A sim-
ilar eﬀect should take place in the crossed reaction
e+ + e− in a strong ﬁeld (Eq.2 of Ref.[7]).

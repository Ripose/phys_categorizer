Problematic solutions to the Landau-Lifshitz
equation

W. E. Baylis and J. Huschilt

February 21, 2014

Abstract

A critical look at the Landau-Lifshitz equation, which has been re-
cently advocated as an “exact” relativistic classical equation for charge
motion with radiation reaction, demonstrates that it does not conserve
energy-momentum. Its failure is dramatic in the one-dimensional case of
a stepped electric ﬁeld, where it predicts discontinuous velocity and thus
inﬁnite radiation. The Lorentz-Dirac equation, on the other hand, in spite
of its preacceleration over distances comparable to the classical electron
radius, does not display such problems.

1 Introduction

Well-known problems of the Lorentz-Dirac (LD) equation,[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
such as runaway solutions, preacceleration, nonuniqueness, have led to proposals
of modiﬁed classical equations for the relativistic motion of a point charge in
electromagnetic ﬁelds, including radiation reaction. Recently Rohrlich[9] has
asserted that forms of the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation[2, 10] represent the
exact equation and should replace the ﬂawed one (LD) derived by Dirac. The
purpose of this letter is to point out that solutions to the LL equation are not
generally consistent with Maxwell’s equations for the radiation. The result is a
fairly simple to show but does not seem to have attracted much attention.

The LD equation for the motion of a point charge e of proper velocity u in an
external electromagnetic ﬁeld F can be written in the index-free formulation[6]
based on Cliﬀord’s geometric algebra of physical space as

m ˙u = e h(F + Fself) uiℜ ,
where the ﬁrst term on the right f = e hFuiℜ ≡ e
/2 is the co-
variant Lorentz force, and Fself = mτed ( ˙u¯u) /dτ is identiﬁed as the eﬀective
ﬁeld of self interaction. We use SI units with c = 1, dots indicate derivatives
with respect to proper time, and τe is two-thirds the time for light to cross the
classical electron radius:

Equation (1) can be expanded in components to give the standard tensor-
component form m ˙uµ = e (F µν + F µν
/dτ,
the summation convention is adopted, the brackets [· · · ] indicate the antisym-
metric part, and the metric tensor is (ηµν ) = diag (1, −1 − 1 − 1) . However,
the component-free algebraic formulation is cleaner and oﬀers additional com-
putational tools. In it, paravectors (scalars plus vectors) represent spacetime
vectors. For example u = γ + u = uµeµ is the proper velocity with time com-
ponent γ ≡ γe0 and spatial part u. An overbar indicates the Cliﬀord conjugate
¯u = γ − u and the Lorentz-invariant square norm is u¯u = γ2 − u2 = uµuνeµ¯eν,
which gives the Minkowski spacetime metric ηµν = heµ¯eνiS as the metric of
paravector space, where hxiS ≡ 1
2 (x + ¯x) is the scalar part of any element x .
Since u is a unit paravector, u¯u = 1, and the proper acceleration ˙u is orthogonal
to u : h ˙u¯uiS = 0. As a consequence,
˙u¯u is a biparavector (a spacetime plane,
represented by a complex vector).
The expansion of Fself gives

where the Lorentz-invariant Larmor power P = −mτe ˙u ˙u is seen from Maxwell’s
equations ¯∂F = µ0¯j to be the power radiated by the accelerating point charge.
It is easily seen[2] that the LD equation (1) conserves energy and momentum
with the radiation ﬁeld between any two points on the world line of the charge
where the acceleration ˙u is the same.

The LL equation[2] is obtained by replacing m ˙u in the radiation term in (1)

where the second line follows from the reality of f and its orthogonality with

Rohrlich[9] in his (4a). It is easily veriﬁed that ˙u here remains orthogonal to u.
As Rohrlich noted, the last term in (4) dictates that the Larmor radiation term

2 A simple example

As a simple example by which to compare solutions of the equations, consider
one-dimensional motion in a pure electric ﬁeld F = E = Ee, where e is a ﬁxed
unit vector. Express the proper velocity in terms of the rapidity w as u =
exp (we) = cosh w + e sinh w. Then ˙u = ˙wue and the Lorentz force is f =
eEu.The LD equation (1) becomes

Ford and O’Connell[11] (1993) derive analytical solutions of the LL equation

They also show that these are the smooth limit of numerical solutions for a
smooth rise and fall of the ﬁeld. Let τ = 0 be the proper time that the charge
enters the ﬁeld from the left ( x = 0 ) and τ = τ1 the proper time that it exits
at x = L. Integration of (11) gives

Note that wLL is discontinuous:
it jumps by ε as the charge enters the ﬁeld
at τ = 0 and then by −ε as the charge leaves at τ = τ1. Consequently, the
acceleration has inﬁnite spikes as the charge enters and leaves the ﬁeld.

Although ˙w and consequently ˙u are inﬁnite at τ = 0, τ1, they are integrable.
However, the Larmor radiation, proportional to − ˙u ˙u = ˙w2, is not. Thus, accord-
ing to Maxwell’s equations for the ﬁeld of a point charge, inﬁnite energy is radi-
ated from the discontinuities. The distance x traveled in the region 0 < x < L

Let’s compare this to solutions of the LD equation (10). In numerical so-
lutions, runaways are avoided by integrating backward in time[12]. In analyt-
ical solutions, they are avoided by assuming limτ →∞ τ E (τ ) = 0 and putting
˙w (∞) = 0. This gives the usual integral form that includes brief periods of

Note that in the LD case, the rapidity and hence the velocity is continuous.
Indeed, it is the same as the rapidity in the LL case except for brief periods of
preacceleration. It is precisely the preacceleration that prevents the acceleration

A comparison with the LL case above veriﬁes that the LL and LD results agree
to ﬁrst order in ε but diﬀer in second order, and speciﬁcally, the energy gain in
the LD case is larger than that in the LL case by γ0ε2.

3 Discussion

Derivations of the LD equation (1) generally assume an expansion u in powers of
the time diﬀerence corresponding to the eﬀective size of the charge. The limit of
vanishing size is then taken, traditionally with mass renormalization, although
such renormalization can be avoided by taking speciﬁed combinations of the self
ﬁeld[1, 6, 13, 14, 15]. One cannot expect the proper velocity to be an analytic
function of position in regions where the ﬁeld itself is discontinuous. However,
discontinuous ﬁelds are simply idealizations convenient for ﬁnding analytic so-
lutions. Solutions of both the LD and LL equations can be found numerically
for more realistic ﬁeld conﬁgurations, and they approach the analytic solutions
in the appropriate limit.

Rohrlich[9] claims to have derived the LL equation as an exact classical
equation for the point charge. However, his derivation, like most others[2],
makes the substitution of an approximate expression from the Lorentz-force
equation with the justiﬁcation that the radiation term is small. He then claims
that because higher-order derivates of the velocity than second disappear in
Dirac’s derivation when the limit of vanishing charge radius is taken, one should
also be able to ignore corresponding derivatives in the ﬁeld. This approach
appears to argue more forcefully for the correctness of the LD equation, which
as seen above conﬂicts with the LL equation. Rohrlich[9] also claims that the LL
equation has been obtained in a rigorous mathematical argument by Spohn[10],
but Spohn obtains his critical surface perturbatively and does not claim it to
be exact to all orders of τe.

The LL equation diﬀers from the LD equation only in second order in τe and
its solutions to realistic problems are practically indistinguishable from those
of the LD equation since τe is orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest
measurable time interval. Nevertheless, as seen above, it is inconsistent with
Maxwell’s equations for the radiation of a point charge and this inconsistency
is dramatic in the case of rectiliner motion through a stepped ﬁeld. This is in
contrast to the LD equation, which is consistent.

Yaghjian[5] has proposed a diﬀerent “correction” to the LD equation. (Most
of his book discusses a model of the electron as a spherical insulator of ﬁnite
radius with a ﬁxed surface charge, but the last section discusses the limit of
vanishing radius to ﬁnd the motion of a point charge.) He argues that the
radiation terms do not act until the ﬁeld is turned on and consequently should
be multiplied by a scalar function that approaches a step function in the limit
of a point charge. This eliminates preacceleration. Although his formulation
does not explicitly treat other abrupt changes in the ﬁeld, for consistency we
assume that the sudden drop in the stepped ﬁeld has no eﬀect on the radiation
terms until τ1 when the charge leaves the ﬁeld. However, this prescription when
applied to the stepped ﬁeld gives precisely the motion of the charge without
any radiation reaction. It is therefore also inconsistent with energy-momentum
conservation and Maxwell’s equation.

As frequently pointed out[16], the problems of the LD equation occur at dis-
tance scales well below the Compton wavelength, where quantum eﬀects become
important. Its breakdown in the description of real particles at such scales is
therefore not surprising. Attempts appear so far unsuccessful to ﬁnd an alterna-
tive classical equation of motion for the point charge that is free from problems
and consistent with energy-momentum conservation and Maxwell’s equations.

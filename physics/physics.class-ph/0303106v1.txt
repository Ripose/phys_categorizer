Abstract
The equation for the conic sections describing the possible orbits in a potential V ∼ r−1 is

obtained by means of a vector constant of the motion diﬀering from the traditional Laplace-Runge-

Lenz vector.

The Laplace-Runge-Lenz1,2,3,4 (or Hermann-Bernoulli-Laplace5) vector provides a simple

and elegant way of obtaining the equation for the orbit of a particle moving under the

inﬂuence of a radial inverse-square-law force.6 This method also has the added advantage

over the more common approach of direct integration of the equations of motion7 that the

very existence of this single-valued constant of the motion explains the otherwise surprising

degeneracy of the Coulomb/Kepler problem.8 Our aim here is to show that there is another

vector constant of the motion which makes a ﬁrst principles derivation of the equation of

the orbit even easier than the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector or the direct integration methods.

The force law F = −kˆr/r2 (we assume k > 0; the repulsive case may be treated along

the same lines) leads to the nonrelativistic equation of motion

and to the well-known conservation laws for energy E = 1

Combining Eq. (2) with Eq. (1) we obtain

Note that Eq. (3) implies immediately that v(0) = v(2π) and that the velocity vector traces

out a circle if θ is allowed to vary from 0 to 2π. Integration of Eq. (3) is trivial if we recall
that d ˆθ/dθ = −ˆr:

where u is a constant vector. This vector is the constant of the motion we propose to use

instead of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector in the derivation of the orbits. It is interesting to

note that a quaternion equivalent to Eq. (4) was already known to Hamilton in 1845.9 Un-

fortunately, this simple result seems to have vanished from textbooks on classical mechanics

after the ﬁrst decade of the twentieth century.10

The vector u may be evaluated in terms of the physical parameters of the problem. If

we choose the angle so that the minimum value of r is at θ = 0 and adjust our coordinate

where ǫ =

1 + 2EL2/mk2 will turn out to be the eccentricity. The plus sign is required at

rmin; substituting this result into Eq. (5) provides us with an alternative form for u:

Obtaining the equation of the orbit is now straightforward. By taking the scalar product

of Eq. (4) with ˆθ and using v · ˆθ = r ˙θ = L/mr, ˆy · ˆθ = cos θ, we ﬁnd

The deﬁnition α = L2/mk allows us to write the solution for r as

which is the usual equation of a conic section with one focus at the origin and eccentricity

circular and characterized by v2

follows almost trivially from Eqs. (4) and (7). Hence the orbit in velocity space is always
x + (vy − kǫ/L)2 = k2/L2. More precisely, the orbit in velocity
space is a circle of radius k/L and center at (0, kǫ/L) if the orbit in position space is a circle

(ǫ = 0), an ellipse (0 < ǫ < 1), or a parabola (ǫ = 1). On the other hand, if the spatial
trajectory is a hyperbola (ǫ > 1), the angle ranges from − cos−1(−1/ǫ) to cos−1(−1/ǫ)

only, and the velocity space orbit is a section of a circle in the upper vx, vy plane with
k(ǫ2 − 1)/ǫL < vy ≤ k(ǫ + 1)/L.

The vector constant of the motion u is simpler (and its derivation certainly easier11) than

the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector, but the two are, of course, not independent constants of the

motion. Indeed, the cross product of Eq. (4) with mL yields

p × L − mkˆr = mu × L.

The left-hand side is the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector A, so A = mu×L. The three conserved

vectors A, u, and L form a right-handed orthogonal system equivalent to ˆx, ˆy, and ˆz after

normalization.

As a ﬁnal comment of pedagogical interest, we present a second approach that may be

useful in an elementary discussion of the Coulomb/Kepler problem. We begin with the
2mv2 − k/r. If we use v · ˆθ = r ˙θ = L/mr to replace 1/r by
expression for the energy E = 1
mv · ˆθ/L in the potential term, we may write E as

If we complete the square in the velocity, we ﬁnd

E =

v · ˆθ .

with u the same vector as in Eq. (4). It follows that the magnitude of u must be constant.

To prove that this vector is conserved both in magnitude and direction, we must only take
a derivative of u and substitute dv/dt = −kˆr/mr2 and d ˆθ/dt = − ˙θˆr into the result. The

equation of the orbit may then be found as before. This approach does not require any

integrations and amounts to a change of gauge from a scalar potential to an eﬀective vector

potential description of the problem.

(Dated: December 31, 2013)

The expansion of a classical Hamilton formalism consisting in adaptation of it to describe the
nonequilibrium systems is oﬀered. Expansion is obtained by construction of formalism on the ba-
sis of the dynamics equation of the equilibrium subsystems by which the nonequilibrium system
is represented.
It has allowed removing restrictions on dynamics of the subsystems, which dic-
tated by the requirement of monogenic and potentiality of the forces between subsystems. Modiﬁed
Lagrange, Hamilton and Liouville equations are obtained. Some features of dynamics of nonequi-
librium systems are considered. Connection between the equation of interaction of subsystems and
a thermodynamic principle of energy is analyzed.

INTRODUCTION

The attempts of further development of methods of re-
searches of nonequilibrium systems collides with a prob-
lem of irreversibility [1-4]. The analysis of approaches to
solution of this problem leads us to conclusion, that the
one of the general reason of its diﬃculties is a restriction
on the frameworks of formalisms of the classical mechan-
ics. Really, creation of the organized structures is caused
by the dissipations. But dissipation is not present in
Hamilton systems because the obtaining of the Hamilton
principle based on condition that the forces of interaction
of systems are potentially and monogenic [5].

Necessity of expansion of formalisms of the classical
mechanics have arisen as a result of investigating of dy-
namics of hard disks [6, 7]. Forces of interaction of hard
disks systems are non-potential. Therefore it was nec-
essary so to modify canonical Lagrange, Hamilton and
Liouville equations that they have been applicable for
the description of dynamics of non-potentially of inter-
acting systems. Such modiﬁcation consisted in obtain-
ing of these equations basing on the D’Alambert prin-
ciple under condition of non-potentiality of the forces
[5]. From modiﬁed Liouville equation followed that non-
potentiality of collective forces of interacting of systems
is a necessary condition of existence of irreversible dy-
namics [7].

In the nature all fundamental forces are potential.
Therefore it was necessary to generalize results of re-
searches of hard disks on systems of potentially inter-
acting elements. For this purpose as a method of the de-
scription of dynamics of nonequilibrium systems we have
taken advantage of an opportunity of representation of
nonequilibrium systems as a set of equilibrium subsys-
tems (ESS). This method of system’s splitting on the
ESS is not new. It was used with success at construc-
tion of statistical physics of equilibrium systems when

interaction ESS can be neglected. But it follows from a
condition of maximum entropy that ESS for nonequilib-
rium system will be in motion in relative to each other
[8]. Therefore to determine their dynamics it is neces-
sary to take into account the interaction between them.
The equation of interaction of systems (UVS) for cal-
culation of the ESS dynamics was obtained within the
framework of classical mechanics [9]. Using UVS and
basing on D’Alambert principle about equality to zero of
a variation of work of eﬀective forces, the modiﬁed La-
grange, Hamilton and Liouville equations for interaction
ESS have obtained. These equations determine expan-
sion of a formalism of the classical mechanics, allowing
study of the open and nonequilibrium systems.

This paper is constructed as follows. The UVS and
modiﬁed Lagrange, Hamilton and Liouville equations are
obtained. The analysis of the important laws of dynamics
of nonequilibrium systems and relation between classical
mechanics and thermodynamics are submitted.

II. THE EQUATION OF ONE SYSTEM
DYNAMICS

Let us show, how obtaining of the equations of dy-
namics of elements and their systems are possible. The
equation of dynamics of two interacting systems will be
obtained in a similar way.

Let us consider system of potentially interacting ele-
If the system is conservative, we will have for
ments.
˙E = 0. The energy of the system depends
energy E:
on elements velocities, and their coordinates. Therefore
we have: E = E(r, v), where r, v are a set of coordinates
and velocities of the particles. In this case the equality,
˙E = 0, takes place only when energy depends on two
additive parts. One part should be a function of veloc-
ity, and the second one - coordinates. Then energy of
the system can be presented as E = ϕ[T + U ] = const,

function as E = T + U by means of scale transformation
and usage of the necessary system of coordinates. So, the
sum of kinetic and potential energies of the system in a
non-homogeneous space should be constant.

Let us take a moving elementary particle with mass m
and velocity v. The kinetic energy corresponding to the
particle will be T (v2) = mv2/2, and the potential energy
-U (r), so E = mv2/2 + U (r) = const. In this case from
equality ˙E = 0 follows that:

v(m ˙v + ∂U/∂r) = 0

(1)

The eq. (1) is a balance equation of the kinetic and po-
tential energies. As eq. (1) should be fulﬁlled in case of
any direction of the vector velocity, the following require-
ment takes place:

m ˙v = −∂U/∂r

(2)

It is Newton equation (NE). This equation is determining
the connection of acceleration of the particle with the
external force. The right hand side of eq. (2) is the active
force. The left hand side - is the inertial force [5]. The
particle moves along the gradient of a potential function.
During the motion of the particle along the closed line
in a potential ﬁeld, the work of forces is equal to zero.
Therefore dynamics of the particle is reversible.

Let us take a system, which consists of N potentially
interacting elements located in the non-homogeneous
space; the mass of each element is equal to 1. The force
acting on each element is equal to the sum of forces of
all elements and the force caused by non-homogeneous
space. The force between two elements is central and it
depends on the distance between them.

thogonality of the vector of eﬀective forces with respect
to the vector of velocities of elements of the system. If
there are no restrictions imposed on the vi directions, the
requirement ˜Fi = 0 is satisﬁed [5]. Then from eq. (3) we
obtain:

It is NE for the system’s elements in non-homogeneous
space. The eq. (4) has coincided with the corresponding
equation in [11] though it is obtained by other way.

Let us obtain an equation of motion of the system as
a whole in an external ﬁeld.
It is known [10], that a
motion of the system in the homogeneous space is char-
acterized by two integrals: energy of motion of the center
of mass and the total energy of motion of the particles
inside of the system relative to the center of mass. We
will name second energy as the internal energy of the
system. Therefore it is reasonable to rewrite the eq. (3)
having presented systems energy as the total of these
two types of energies. For this purpose we can use the

kinetic energy of motion of the system as a whole, and
the term ˙Eins

The right hand side determines the change of energy of
the system as a result of action of external forces.

Let us to transfer to the generalized variables in eq.
(5). For this purpose we will represent velocity of the
motion of elements of the system as the sum of veloci-
ties of their motion with respect to the center of mass
of the system - ˜vi , and velocity of the center of mass
vi = ˜vi + VN . Using these vari-
itself - VN ,

Let us take into account that rij = ˜rij = ˜ri − ˜rj, where
˜ri, ˜rj - are coordinates of the elements with respect to the
center of mass of the system. So UN (rij ) = UN (˜rij ) =

The eq. (6) determines the balance of energy of the
system in non-homogeneous space. The ﬁrst term in the
left hand side corresponds to change of kinetic energy of
motion of system as the whole. The second term deter-
mines the change of internal energy.

Let us take into account that F env = F env(R + ˜ri),
and suppose that R ≫ ˜ri. Then it is possible to ex-
pand the force F env in a series using a small parameter,
˜ri/R. Keeping the terms up to ﬁrst-order of inﬁnitesimal,
we will have: F env

The force F env

right hand side of eq.(7) determines the work of external
forces. The ﬁrst term is depending on the velocity of
systems motion and coordinate of its center of mass. It
is determine the change of kinetic energy of system as
the whole.

The second term is depending on coordinates of parti-
cles and their velocities in relative to the center of mass.

It is determine the change of internal energy of system.
Thus, work of external forces is splitting on two essen-
tially diﬀerent parts.

The right hand side is the ﬁrst order of inﬁnitesimal,

because despite R ≫ ˜ri, it value are not small.

If the external ﬁeld is homogeneous then (∇F env)i0 =
(7) is separating, and we

0. The variables in the eq.
have:

MN ˙VN = F env

m ˙˜vi = −F ( ˜ri)i

The eq. (8) is an equation of the motion of the sys-
tem as a whole in an external ﬁeld, and the eq. (9) is
an equation of the motion of elements of the system. It
follows from these equations, that in a homogeneous ex-
ternal ﬁeld the kinetic energy of the system as a whole
is variable only, and the internal energy is constant. The
change of this kinetic energy does not depend on the
forces between elements. The system is equivalent to the
single body with the mass which is equal to the sum of
masses of the particles. The motion of elements of the
system does not depend on an external ﬁeld and is de-
termined by forces of interaction only.

Thus, the system of potentially interacting elements in
an external ﬁeld can be considered, us a structured par-
ticle. Generally the work of external forces changes both
its internal energy, and energy of its movement. There-
fore dynamics of such system (or the structured particle)
is determined by the equation (6). When the hetero-
geneity of external forces can be neglected, dynamics of
system is described by the Newton equation.

III. THE EQUATION OF INTERACTION OF
TWO SUBSYSTEMS

Let us accept that the nonequilibrium system can be
presented by set of moving relative to each other of ESS.
For ESS a role of external forces carry out forces from
other ESS. Obviously, it is impossible to neglect by het-
erogeneity of these forces in generally. Therefore dynam-
ics ESS will be described by the equation (6) in which the
external forces is a forces from other ESS. Hence, hav-
ing replaced in (6) the right-hand side on these forces,
we will obtain the UVS which describe the dynamics of
nonequilibrium system. Let us show, how it is possible
to obtain UVS.

Let us the system consists of two interacting equilib-
rium subsystems - L and K. Let us all elements to be
identical and have the same weight 1, and L to be a num-
ber of elements in L - subsystem, K -is a number of ele-

ments in K -subsystem, i.e. L + K = N , VL = 1/L

and VK = 1/K

vi - are subsystems’ velocities with re-

spect to the center of mass. Let the velocity of the center
of mass be equal to zero, i.e. LVL + KVK = 0.

L

Pi=1

We can represent the energy of the system as EN =
EL + EK + U int = const, where EL and EK are the
subsystems’ energies, and U int - is the energy of their
interaction. According to the eq. (4), the energy of each
subsystem can be represented as EL = T tr
L , EK =
L = MLV 2

ML = mL, MK = mK. Eins- is the internal energy
of a subsystem. The Eins consists of the kinetic energy

mass - T ins and their potential energy - U ins, i.e. Eins =

jk, jL, iK, iL determine belonging of the elements to cor-
responding subsystem. In equilibrium T tr = 0. Hence,
if the system aspirates to equilibrium, then T tr energy
for each subsystem will be transformed into the internal
energy.

We have obtained the equations of dynamics of L and
K ESS in the following way. Let us diﬀerentiate energy
of system on time. In order to ﬁnd the equation for L -
subsystem, at the left hand side of obtained equality we
have kept only those terms which determine the change
of the kinetic and potential energies of interaction of el-
ements of L - subsystem. We replaced all other terms
in the right hand side and combined the groups of terms
in such a way when each group represents plurality of
the terms forming the NE for K-subsystems elements.
Therefore these groups are equal to zero. As a result the
right hand side of the equation will be contain only the
terms which determine the change of the potential energy
of interaction of the elements L - subsystem with the el-
ements K - subsystem. The equation for K - subsystem
we will obtain in the same way. So we will have:

For obtaining from the equations (b, c) the equations

the whole, and second is a change of its internal energy.
With this purpose let us take into account that velocities
of the elements can be represented as the sum of their
velocities with respect to the center of mass of the ESS
and the velocity of the ESS with respect to the center of
mass of the system, vi = ˜vi + V . Then with a help of (a),
we will obtain from (b, c):

The eqs. (10, 11) are equations of systems interaction
(UVS). The ﬁrst terms in the left hand side of UVS is a
change of motion energy of ESS - ” ˙T tr”, and the second
terms is a change of their internal energy - ” ˙Eins”.

The right hand side of UVS are consisting of two terms
determining the work of collective forces of interaction
ESS. The ﬁrst terms, ”ΦL ” and ”ΦK”, determine the
work of the interaction force on transformation of motion
energy of ESS into their internal energy. The second
terms include potential force, ”Ψ”. It is a central force
which depends on distances between the centers of mass
of ESS: Ψ = Ψ(RLK), where RLK = RL − RK. The
work of ”Ψ” determines the change of velocities of ESS.
As well as in the case of the motion of the system in a
non-homogeneous external ﬁeld (see the eq. (7)), when
RL ≫ ˜riL , RK ≫ ˜riK this work can be estimated by
expanding of force in a Taylor series.

It is possible to transform the equations (10, 11)
to the form of the equations containing forces of fric-

MK ˙VK = −Ψ − αKVK

(13)

Here coeﬃcients ”αL”, ”αK” are equal to the ratio be-
tween the energy of motion and the full kinetic energy
of correspondent ESS. Thus, the forces of interaction of
the ESS are divided into the potential and non-potential
parts, and α is a similar to the friction coeﬃcient. The
non-potential part of the force determined by coeﬃcient
corresponds to dissipation. It is important to note that
here energy is not disappeared. Actually the value of en-
ergy is constant, but energy is redistributed between the
elements of the subsystem. The eqs. (12, 13) are equiva-
lent to the empirical motion equations for the structured
particles.

Let us perform the following replacement: VL =
KVLK/N , VK = −LVLK/N , where VLK = ˙RLK≡VL −
VK. As the center of mass of the system is immovable,
we will have from eqs.(10, 11):

(14)

LK = VLK(MR ˙VLK + Ψ) - is
Here Φ = −ΦL + ΦK,
the change of energy of the relative motion of the ESS,
MR = mKL/N .

˙Etr

The second and third terms in the eq. (14) determine
the change of their internal energies. The right hand side
determines the change of interaction energy. It is obvious
that for an equilibrium system ˙Etr
LK = 0. Then the eq.
(14) is splitting on two independent equations for ESS.

We see that the work of the forces between ESS goes
not only on change of their kinetic and potential energy,
as in the case of elementary particles.
It also goes on
change of their internal energy. Therefore the force of
interaction ESS represents the sum of two various forces.
The ﬁrst force determines motion of ESS as the whole as
a result of mutual transformation their kinetic and po-
tential energies. It is potential force. The second force
determines the work on transformation of energy of inter-
action to the internal energy of ESS. It is non-potential
force. This force does not change the momentums of ESS.
Thus, it is possible to consider equilibrium subsystems
L and K as the structured particles. The motion of ESS
are determined not only by transformations their kinetic
and potential energy. But it is determined by the changes
of their internal energy olso. Therefore the force of in-
teraction ESS represents the sum of two various forces.
The ﬁrst force determines motion of ESS as the whole as
a result of mutual transformation their kinetic and po-
tential energies. It is potential force. The second force
determines the work on transformation of motion energy
into the internal energy of ESS. It is non-potential force.
This force does not change the momentums of ESS.

If L = 1, K = N − 1 the equation (10) for L - subsys-
tem will coincide with NE. The internal energy will be
absent, and force acting on it will be potential. Therefore
its dynamics is reversible. Therefore reversibility of dy-
namics of separate elements does not mean yet reversibil-
ity of dynamics of their systems. It is essential diﬀerence

UVS from NE for elementary particles because in accord-
ing with NE, the elementary particles return into initial
points if the direction of velocity of their centers of mass
will change on opposite, but ESS does not come back into
initial points of their phase space when reversing them
velocities.

Generally the potentials of interaction between parti-
cles inside ESS can be distinct from potentials of inter-
action of particles for diﬀerent ESS.

IV. THE LAGRANGE, HAMILTON AND
LIOUVILLE MODIFIED EQUATIONS

There is a question as in connection with the UVS the
canonical Lagrange, Hamilton and Liouville are modi-
ﬁed. The canonical equations follow from the integral
principle of Hamilton [5, 14]. In turn the integral prin-
ciple of Hamilton follows from diﬀerential principle of
D’Alambert in case of potentiality of active forces be-
tween ESS. D’Alambert equation is formulated on the
basis of NE.

In accordance with D’Alambert principle: ”the work of
the eﬀective forces which includes the inertial and active
forces is equal to zero for all reversible virtual displace-
ments compatible with the restrictions given” [5]. For
the closed non-equilibrium system that represents them-
selves by a set of the ESS, this principle will be as follows:
the work of all forces of interaction of the ESS is equal
to zero for all reversible virtual displacements compatible
with the restrictions given.

If the change of the internal energy of ESS can be ne-
glected, the work on their motion will be determined only
by the potential part of interaction ESS forces. In this
case instead UVS we can use NE and therefore come to
the known canonical equations of a classical mechanics
[5]. If the neglecting by the change of internal energy is
impossible, D’Alambert equation should be written down
on the basis UVS which take into account the distribu-
tion of the subsystems’ motion energy as a whole between
its internal energies in the result of the work of the non-
potential part of forces.

Let us take a closed non-equilibrium system consisting
of N elements which can be represented by a set of R =
2 an ESS. The modiﬁcation of formalism is carried out
by standard way [5]. Firstly, on the basis of UVS the
D’Alambert equation is obtained. Based on it a principle
of Hamilton, and then Lagrange equation are obtained.
After that the Hamilton and Liouville equations for ESS
are deduced.

If there are no external restrictions on system then the
virtual displacements of the elements and ESS can be
combined with the real ones [5]. As virtual work of all
forces is determined by the eq. (14) we will have:

δ ¯WLK = δEtr

LK + δEins

L + δEins

K + δΦ = 0

(15)

The eq.
(15) is D’Alambert equation for a non-
equilibrium system. The ﬁrst three terms in (15) deter-

mine the virtual change of energies of the ESS. The two
last terms determine the virtual work for displacement of
the elements of one ESS in the ﬁeld of forces of the ele-
ments of the other ESS. I.e. they determine the change
of internal energies of the ESS. The line above δ ¯WLK
means that it is just a diﬀerential form which does not
come to a scalar function variation.

Let us transform the eq. (15) by means of multiplying
by dt, and integrating from t = t1 to t = t2. As a result
we will have:

The last two items in (16) are not the full diﬀerentials
from any scalar function. I.e. in general it is impossible
to represent the active forces of ESS interaction in the
form of a gradient from a forcing function. Such forces
are named as polygenic ones.

Let us the virtual displacements be equal to zero at
the ends of the interval [t1, t2]. Then the eq. (16) can be
rewritten as follows:

δS =

Here S- is action, ℑ =

Fn = F L

n .

All variables are independent, and that is why in order
to achieve simpliﬁcation we have used through indexing
for all elements of the system instead of indexing in accor-
dance with the ESS, and at the same time new indexing
is in accordance with the one accepted in the eq. (16).
Thus, the action for a non-equilibrium system consists of
the terms describing dynamics of the ESS as a whole, in-
terior dynamics of the elements of the ESS and the term
describing interaction of the ESS.

It follows from the requirement of independence of the

generalized variables that

d/dt(∂ℑ/∂vn) − ∂ℑ/∂rn = −Fn

(18)

This is the very modiﬁed Lagrange equation for a non-
equilibrium system. The right hand side of the eq. (18)

is equal to zero only when the relative motion of the ESS
are absent. It should take place when the system is in
equilibrium.

The eqs. (10, 11) were obtained by means of indepen-
dent methods from the requirement of the system energy
to be constant.
It allows us to write the modiﬁed La-
grange equation for each of the ESS at once.

d/dt(∂ℑL/∂viL) − ∂ℑL/∂riL = −F K

(19)

d/dt(∂ℑK/∂viK ) − ∂ℑK/∂riK = −F L

(20)

Here ℑL and ℑK - are Lagrange functions for the ESS.
Now let’s obtain modiﬁed Hamilton equation. For ℑ

the diﬀerential can be written as dℑ=

[(∂ℑ/∂vn)dvn+

(∂ℑ/∂rndrn)] + ∂ℑ/∂tdt. With the help of Leg-

have:

∂H/∂rn = − ˙pn − Fn

(21)

(22)

The above are modiﬁed Hamilton equations for a non-
equilibrium system. The right hand side of the eq. (21)
denotes non-potential forces. Modiﬁed Hamilton’s equa-
tions for the ESS can be obtained in the same way.

Now let us obtain Liouville equations for the ESS and
full system. For this porpoise let us take a generalized
current vector JL = JL(vn, ˙pn) of the L-subsystem (here
”n” index corresponds only to the particles of the L-
subsystem). From the eqs. (21, 22) we ﬁnd: divJL =

the elements of the L- subsystem. With the help of the
continuity equation we will have: dfL/dt = ∂fL/∂t +

There is a formal solution of the eq.

lows that the distribution function of a subsystem de-
pends on time if force acting on the subsystem depends
on velocities of the elements of the subsystem. It is sim-
ilar result as for a hard disks systems [7].

The modify Liouville equation for system can be obtain

from eqs. (21, 22) if n = 1, 2...N . We will have:

dfN /dt = fN ∂Fn/∂pn

(24)

Despite absence of external forces for a system, the right
hand side of the eq. (24) is not equal to zero. It is caused
by the fact that the energy of subsystems’ interaction
does not include into ESS energy. Therefore the right
hand side of the eq. (24) will not be equal to zero until
the energy of interaction of the ESS is not transformed
into their internal energy.

The reason of distinction between two descriptions of
system (in a framework of canonical and modiﬁed equa-
tion) is the total work of potential forces between par-
ticles in the closed system is equal to zero. But the
work on moving ESS is not equal to zero. The New-
ton equation for select particles can not determine this
work. Therefore modiﬁed Lagrange, Hamilton and Liou-
ville equations as against their canonical prototypes, are
applicable for the description of dynamics of nonequilib-
rium systems.

V. SOME PROPERTIES OF DYNAMICS OF
INTERACTING SUBSYSTEMS

In accordance with UVS, in order to describe a non-
equilibrium system, the energy should be divided into
T tr and Eins. As UVS includes the parameter describ-
ing the degree of non-equilibrium of a system, it allows
studying evolution of the system. Let us to analyze some
important cases of the system’s dynamics.
In general case the non-potential

forces can be

rewritten as: ΦL =

L

ΦiL (RK, ˜riL , ˜viL ), ΦK =

PiL=1
If the sizes of ESS are less

ΦiK (RL, ˜riK , ˜viK ).

˜viK = 0.

In this case the

PiK =1
eqs.
(10, 11) are the Newton equations for two hard
bodies. This case is similar to the case of homogeneity
of an external ﬁeld of forces.

PiK =1

In the case when Ψ = 0, VL = VK = 0, the ﬁrst terms
of the left side of UVS are equal to zero and the system is

7

in equilibrium. The full energy of the system is equal to
the sum of Eins for each subsystem. Such system can be
studied with the help of canonical Hamilton equations.
ESS. Gibbs used this approach for creation of statistical
mechanics of equilibrium systems [3, 11].

Now let us velocities of the elements with respect to
the centers of mass of corresponding ESS be equal to
zero during interaction of the ESS (this is a hard body
approach). Then the right hand side, and also the second
terms of left hand side of UVS are equal to zero, and UVS
is transformed into NE for two hard bodies.

It is possible to come from classical mechanics to ther-
modynamics with the help of the UVS. Really, the right
hand side of eqs. (10, 11) determines an change of ESS
energy. The ﬁrst term of the left hand side of UVS de-
termines the change of the motion energy of ESS as the
whole. In thermodynamics it corresponds to work, which
is carried out by external forces acting on ESS on the part
of an environment. The second term of the left hand side
corresponds to increase in the entrance energy of a ESS.
In thermodynamics this term corresponds to the change
of thermal energy of ESS.

Let us consider the relation between the UVS and
the basic equation of thermodynamics in details. We
can write the basic equation of thermodynamics [8,13]:
dE = dQ − P dY . Here, according to common termi-
nology, E is energy of a ESS; Q is thermal energy; P
is pressure; Y is volume. We take into account that
N >> 1, MN = 1. The energy change of the selected
ESS is due to the work made by external forces. There-
fore, the change in full energy of a subsystem corresponds
to dE.

The change of kinetic energy of motion of a ESS as
the whole, dT tr, corresponds to the term P dY . Really,
dT tr = V dV = V ˙V dt = ˙V dr = P dY

Let us determine, what term in UVS corresponds to
the change of the internal energy of ESS. As follows from
virial theorem [10], if the potential energy is a homoge-
neous function of second order of the radiuses-vectors,
then ¯Eins = 2 ¯˜T ins = 2 ¯˜U ins. The line denotes the time
average. Earlier we obtained that the energy, Eins, in-
creases due to T tr. But the opposite process is impos-
sible. Therefore the change of the term Q in the UVS
corresponds to the change of the energy Eins.

0

Let us consider the ESS near to equilibrium.
If
the ESS consist of N elements, the average energy of
each element becomes, ¯Eins = Eins/N = κT ins
. Now
let the internal energy increases with dQ. According
to the virial theorem, keeping the terms of the ﬁrst
order, we have: dQ ≈ T ins
[dv/v0],
where v0 is the average velocity of an element, and
dv is its change. For ESS in equilibrium, we have
dv/v0 ∼ dΓ/Γ, where Γ is the phase volume of a ESS,
dΓ will increase due to increasing of the ESS energy on
the value, dQ. By keeping the terms of the ﬁrst or-
der we get: dQ ≈ T ins
0 dΓ/Γ = T ins
0 d ln Γ. By deﬁnition
d ln Γ = dSins, where Sins is a subsystem entropy [9]. So,
near equilibrium we have dQ ≈ T ins
0 dSins. So formally

[dEins/T ins

] = T ins

0

according with UVS the entropy production in the non-
equilibrium system is determined by transformation of
the motion energy of ESS into the internal energy. If it so
eventually relative velocities of ESS go to zero. In result
the energy of relative motion of ESS will be completely
transforms into the internal energy and the systems equi-
librates. It means that energy of motion of a ESS goes on
increase of entropy. Therefore the deviation of entropy
from equilibrium can be determined by the next formula
[7]:

R

ml

∆S =

{ml

Xl=1

Xk=1

Z Xs

Eml

Fks

mlvk

dt}

(25)

Here Eml is the kinetic energy of ESS; ml is the number
elements in ESS ”l”; R is the number of ESS; s is num-
ber of the external element which collided with internal
element k; F ml
is a force, acted on element k-element;
ks
vk -is a velocity of the k- element.

The formula (25) means, that a entropy production
is provided by the energy of relative motion of ESS. It
corresponds to entropy deﬁnition for the non-equilibrium
systems, which was oﬀered in [8].

But for informal connection of the equations of interac-
tion of systems with thermodynamics, the increase of in-
ternal energy due to the energy of relative motion should
be irreversible. Below some arguments for the beneﬁt of
such increase will be oﬀered.

In connection with the law of momentum preservation
of ESS the internal energy of the ESS is gradually in-
creased due to energy ˙Etr
LK. I.e. there is a gradual de-
crease of VLK. To explain this fact let us take an equi-
librium system and divide it into ESS. It follows from
the requirement of equilibrium that the forces between
the ESS are equal to zero. But if there are no external
forces with respect to a subsystem, the subsystem can-
not start moving. Indeed in this case the subsystem can
start moving only due to its internal energy. But it is
prohibited by the law of conservation of momentum of
the subsystem. I.e. if the system is in equilibrium then
it will be always remain in equilibrium state.

Now let us consider two interacting ESS which are in
relative motion. The relative velocity of ESS can not be
increased due to the energy of interaction of the ESS as
this energy is itself determined by the relative velocities
of the ESS. As well as in the previous case, this velocity
can not be increased due to the internal energy of the
ESS. So relative velocity can be decreased only.

It is follows from these arguments that UVS character-
izes motion of system to an equilibrium state as a result
of transition of energy of relative motion of ESS into in-
ternal energy. When system is in equilibrium, or when it
is possible to freeze internal degrees of freedom of ESS,
i.e. to neglect the change of their internal energy, then
UVS is reduced to NE. Hence, it is possible to assert,
that the broken of the time-symmetry of the systems dy-
namics is caused by the increasing of the internal energy.
The decreasing of internal energy is prohibited by the law

of conservation of momentum of the subsystem.

VI. CONCLUSION

Expansion of a formalism of classical mechanics and
approach to the analysis of nonequilibrium systems are
based on the key statement that closed non-equilibrium
systems can be represented as a set of moving ESS [8].
This statement allowed transforming the tasks of dynam-
ics of a non-equilibrium system to the tasks of dynam-
ics of ESS. The oﬀered approach has allowed removed
the restrictions of applicability formalism of the classical
mechanics, bound with the requirement of conservatism
of systems.
It has appeared enough for elimination of
contradictions between a classical mechanics and ther-
modynamics.

Having expressed energy of system in the form of en-
ergy of a motion of ESS as the whole, their internal ener-
gies and energy of their interaction and diﬀerentiated it
on the time, the UVS has been obtained. This equation
is equivalent to the equation of structured particles.

In agreement with UVS the dynamics of ESS is deter-
mined by the collective force of their interaction. This
force consists of two parts. The potential part is deter-
mining the transformation of the interaction energy into
the motion energy of ESS. Non-potential force is deter-
mining the transformation of the ESS motion energy into
internal energy. Thus, unlike dynamics of an elementary
particle, the dynamics of ESS is determined by the work
of interaction forces which will transform energy of inter-
action not only into potential and kinetic energy of ESS
motion as the whole, how we have in the case of elemen-
tary particle, but also into the internal energy. Therefore
based on NE which is valid only for elementary particles,
it is impossible to describe the dynamics of the nonequi-
librium system.

Based on UVS the modiﬁed Lagrange, Hamilton and
Liouville equations was obtained. These equations are
applicable to the study of dynamics of the open non-
equilibrium systems because its have allowed taking into
account the work of non-potential part of force on trans-
formation of energy of ESS motion into their internal
energy.

The following mechanism of irreversibility can be pro-
posed: energy of ESS relative motion is transformed into
their internal energy as a result of the work of the non-
potential part of force of interaction of ESS. The decreas-
ing of internal energy is prohibited by the law of conser-
vation of momentum of the ESS. Therefore the system
equilibrates, when relative motion of ESS is absent.

The explanation of the First law of thermodynamics is
based on the fact that the work of subsystems’ interaction
forces changes both the energy of their motion and their
internal energy. The explanation of the Second law of
thermodynamics is based on the condition of irreversible
transformation of the subsystems’ relative motion energy
into their internal energy.

The solution many problems are necessary for the fur-
ther development of the oﬀered approach to studying
nonequilibrium systems and the strict proof of the con-
clusions oﬀered here. Questions about the ways of split-
ting of nonequilibrium system on ESS, about character

of transformation of energy of relative motion of ESS in
their internal energy, etc., are the most important be-
tween them.

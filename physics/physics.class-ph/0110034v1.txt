SOME ANALYTICAL RESULTS
ON CLASSICAL TUNNELING
OF SOMMERFELD PARTICLE

A simple example of especially constructed potential barrier enables to show
analytically (not numerically) the existence of tunneling eﬀect for a Sommerfeld
particle.

03.50.De

Let us remind that Sommerfeld model of charged rigid sphere [1] (Sommer-
feld particle) is the simplest theoretical model to take into consideration the
”back-reaction” of self-electromagnetic ﬁeld on equation of motion of a radiat-
ing extended charged body (for point-like charge we have the known Lorentz-
Dirac equation with all its problems: renormalization of mass, preacceleration,
runaway solutions, etc.).

For the case of simplicity here we consider the nonrelativistic, linear in ve-

locity, version of Sommerfeld model [2].

So let the total charge of a uniformly charged sphere be Q, mechanical mass

- m, radius - a. Then its equation of motion reads [1,2]:

m ˙~v = ~Fext + η [~v(t

2a/c)

~v(t)]

−

−

(1)

~R - coordinate of the center of the shell, ~Fext -

here η = Q2
some external force.

3ca2 , ~v = d ~R/dt,

This equation has no runaway solutions and solutions with preacceletation.
But, as was shown in [3], it has the solutions, which one can interpret as classical
tunneling. The physics of such eﬀect is simple - Sommerfeld particle due to
retardation begins to ”feel” the action of potential barrier too late, when this
barrier is overcome.

In [3] the existence of solutions with tunneling eﬀect was demonstrated with

the help of numerical calculations.

Here we present one simple problem, which enables us to see the appearance
of classical tunneling without numerical calculations but using only analytical
considerations.

Let the Sommerfeld particle move along z -axis ( ~R = (0, 0, R) ) in a static

Now let us construct the solution of eq. ( 3) for Sommerfeld particle.
Suppose the particle in its motion reaches the point y =

1/2 at τ = 0,
y = 1/2 - at τ = t1, y = 3/2 - at τ = t2 in such a way that the following
inequality fulﬁlls

−

This inequality greatly simpliﬁes the further consideration.
Let the particle for τ < 0 move with constant velocity

t2 < 1

dy
dτ

= v0 = const

Then as t2 < 1 the ﬁrst, retarded, term in square bracket in ( 3) for all time
intervals with τ < 1 will be constant and equal to v0. So the equation (3)
splits into three linear equations with the following boundary conditions - par-
ticle’s coordinate and velocity y and dy
dτ must be continuous functions of time

Consider one particular case.
Let the initial velocity be

Let us ﬁnd those solutions of transcendental equations ( 7) and ( 9) for which
the initial velocity (10) is greater then the critical Newtonian value √2λ:

λ
k

> √2λ or λ > 2k2

If such solutions indeed exist for some values of k and λ, then this would indicate
the appearance of eﬀect of classical tunneling for Sommerfeld particle.

As the inequality v0 < 1 should be valid, so

(10)

v0 =

Thus from (11) and (12) follows that

2k2 < λ < k <

(13)

Furthermore the above taken restrictions t1 < 1 (equivalent to z1 < 0.5 due to
k < 0.5 ) and t2 < 1 ( equivalent to z1 + z2 < 0.5 ) also should be valid.

For initial velocity in the form (10), solution of ( 7) is simple:

z1 = ln

With the help of (14), eq.( 9) can be reduced to

(b > 2 due to (11) )

(14)

2 + b = 2bz2 + (1 + b)e

−z2

(15)

Equation (15) for z2 > 0 and b > 2 always has a root.

This root one can consider as the function of parameter b: z2 = z2(b).

Diﬀerentiation of (15) with respect to b yields:

e−z2

(1 + b)e−z2 = (due to (15 ) =

< 0 f or b > 2 and z2 < 0.5

(16)

so the function z2(b) monotonically decreases with b.

Let us introduce new variable

In consequence of (16), the function ξ(b) also is monotonic function

z1 + z2 = z2(b) + ln

Maximum value of ξ is 0.5 (— z1 + z2 < 0.5 ). This value is reached, as one

can numerically calculated using eq. (15, 17), when

≈
Thus for b > bmin, due to monotony, the roots z1 and z2 lie in allowed intervals.

b = bmin

So for

solutions ( 6) and ( 8) describe the tunneling through potential barrier in spite
of the fact, that the initial velocity is greater then the critical value. With this
Sommerfeld particle appears for moments of time τ > t2 in forbidden, from
classical point of view, area.

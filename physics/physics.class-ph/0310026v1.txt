We present a general proof based on Kramers-Kronig relations that, in a normal or anomalous
dispersive linear medium, any (discontinuitynonanalytic disturbance) in an electromagnetic pulse
can not propagate faster than the phase velocity, c. Consequently the information carried by the
discontinuity (nonanalytical disturbance) can not be transmitted superluminally.

PACS numbers: 42.25.Bs, 42.50.Lc, 42.70.Qs

According to the Einstein’s theory of special relativ-
ity, the speed of any moving object can not exceed the
speed of light in vacuum c. However it is well-known
that the group velocity of a light pulse vg can exceed c
in an anamolously dispersive medium [1]. This interest-
ing eﬀect is a result of interference of diﬀerent frequency
components of the light pulse [2, 3]. The superluminal
phenomenon disappears when the pulse loses the coher-
ence [4].

Sommerfeld and Brillouin observed in 1914 that a
superluminal group velocity does not violate causality
[5, 6, 7]. They observed that the front velocity, (the veloc-
ity of a sharp nonanalytic discontinuity in a light pulse),
should be used as the signal velocity at which informa-
tion is transmitted and this velocity does not exceed c.
The analysis of Sommerfeld and Brillouin is based on the
propagation of an electromagnetic wave of the form

f (t) =

0

(t < 0)
sin(2πt/τ ) (t > 0)

(cid:26)

(1)

through an anamolously dispersive medium with strong
absorption, characterzed by a Lorentzian susceptibilty
that is proportional to ω−2. The sharp begining of the
light wave (1) corresponds to the signal. The debate con-
cerning the information velocity in media still remains
due to progress in experiments. For example, a recent
experiment by Wang et al. reports superluminal propa-
gation in a gain medium with susceptibility proportional
to ω−1 [8]. It is therefore a matter of great interest to
give a general proof about the causal nature of the prop-
agation of classical information (carried by the front or
discontinuities) with a velocity less than or equal to c.

We note that the peak superluminal propagation of
a light pulse in a dielectric medium, when the spec-
trum of the incident pulse is in the anomalous disper-
sion frequency range of the medium, can be derived
from Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory. The superlu-
minal propagation is therefore a classical phenomenon
and the question whether the information can be trans-
mitted with a velocity faster than c needs to be ad-

dressed classically. Any practical pulse must have a be-
ginning (a starting point of a non-equilibrium process)
[1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Furthermore, any nonanalytical dis-
turbance (a discontinuity of the ﬁeld or its ﬁrst or higher
order derivatives) [9, 10, 12] carries classical information.
The front of the pulse is one of such discontinuities.

In this letter, we prove, based only on Kramers-Kronig
relations and the Maxwell equations, that any nonanalyt-
ical disturbance (any discountinuity including the front)
in pulses propagates at the phase velocity in a linear
medium. It should be emphsized that our general and
rigorous proof has no requirement on the form of inci-
dent ﬁeld and the particularity of the medium.

We consider the propagation of an electromagnetic
pulse through a medium occupying the spapce from z = 0
to an arbitrary z > 0 whose response to the electric ﬁeld
of the light pulse is linear. After passing through the
medium, the light ﬁeld at the position z and at time t
can be written as

Em (z, t) =

dt1E0(0, t1)G(t1 − t + z/c; z),

has the property of the retarded Green function. Here
E0(0, t1) is the input ﬁeld and σ(ω) = n(ω) − 1 + iκ(ω)
with n(ω) and κ(ω) being the real and imaginary parts
of the complex refractive index, respectively. Since n(ω)
and κ(ω) satisfy the Kramers-Kronig relations [15], it can
be shown that σ(ω) is an analytic function in the upper
half plane and consequently σ(ω) can be expanded into
An/ωn for |ω| → ∞ , where An are

the form: σ(ω) =

the expansion coeﬃcients.

Pn=1

For the pulse propagation through vacuum, σ(ω) = 0.
Therefore the output ﬁeld at z is Ev(z, t) = E0(0, t −
z/c),i.e., the light pulse propagates with velocity c.

For the pulse propagation through a medium, the func-

tion G(ξ; z) as given by Eq. (3) can be rewritten as

From Eq. (6), we see that the output ﬁeld has two parts:
the ﬁrst part is an instant response which leads to a time
delay (z/c) for the discontinuities in the ﬁeld, and the
second part is the retarded response from the medium.
In the following, we will prove that the second term is
a continuous function. The discontinuity in the ﬁeld is
therefore determined by the ﬁrst term, thus proving that
the discontinuity always prapagates with the phase ve-
locity.

As the integral function in Eq. (5) is analytic in the
upper half plane, J(ξ; z) is equal to 0 for ξ > 0 since

where the step leading to second line is because the func-
tion
tends to zero when |ω| → ∞;
in the second line, the integral is along the closed path C′
(see Fig. 1(b)); in the third line the integrals are along
the ﬁnite numbers of neighborhoods of the isolated sin-
gular points and tangent lines, and these intergrals are
ﬁnite; In the fourth line we describe a dashed circle of a
radius r which embraces all these ﬁnite sigularities and
tangent lines as shown in Fig. 1(b); and in the ﬁfth line,
we let ω = r × eiϕ. Therefore, we have the inequality

|J(ξ; z)| ≤

radius r. This means that J(ξ; z) is bounded. Because
the function J(ξ, z) is bounded, the second term in Eq.
(6) is continuous. A discontinuity in the input ﬁeld am-
plitude at time ts, will occur in the output ﬁeld after
passing through the medium only at the time equal to
ts + z/c. This is the arrival time of information carried
by the discontinuity after passing through the medium,
which propagates with the phase velocity c.

The intensity discontinuity might disappear under
some speciﬁc cases due to the second term. The rea-
son is that although |a|2 − |b|2 6= 0, |a + c|2 − |b + c|2 may
be equal to zero for complex numbers a, b, c. Once such
a discontinuity disappears, there is no intensity disconti-
nuity at any time, and the information is lost. It should
be pointed out that there is no requirement for the form
of the incident ﬁeld in the above proof and particularity
of the medium except the Kramers-Kronig relations.

Next we consider the propagation of a nonanalytic dis-
turbance in the derivatives of the ﬁeld amplitude. Sup-
pose the 0th to the (n − 1)th order derivatives of the
ﬁeld are continuous functions, while the nth derivative
has a discontinuity. How does this kind of nonalytical
disturbance propagate? From Eq. (6), we obtain

Therefore, the second term in Eq.
(12) is a continu-
ous function of time. The discontinuity in the nth order
derivative of the output ﬁeld solely comes from the ﬁrst
term in Eq. (12) (recall that the 0th to the (n − 1)th
order derivatives are continuous).

FIG. 2: The intensities and their ﬁrst order derivatives of
the output ﬁelds after passing through the gain medium
(solid lines) and the same distance of vacuum (dashed lines).
The input ﬁeld is E(0, t) = 2.0 exp[−t2/(2σ2
t )] when t ≤ 0,
E(0, t) = 2.0 − 5.0t when 0 < t < 0.2, and E(0, t) =
exp[−(t − 0.2)2/(2σ2
t )] when t ≥ 0.2. The parameter of the
medium is the same as WKD’s experiment[8].

We can conclude that the discontinuity in the nth order
derivative propagates with the phase velocity c. This dis-
continuity might also be washed out under certain cases.
Once this discontinuity disappears, there is no disconti-
nuity at any other time (the information is lost). Any
initial discontinuity in the nth order derivative (includ-
ing the 0-th order) never leads to any new nonanalytical
disturbances during the propagation. Therefore there is
one to one correspondance between the disturbances (in-
formation) in the output ﬁeld and the input ﬁeld.

As a numerical example, the propagation time of the
discontinuities in the ﬁrst order derivative are calculated,
see Fig. 2. There are two nonanalytical disturbances in
the ﬁrst order derivative of the input ﬁeld at t1 = 0
and t2 = 0.2µs, and other parts of the input ﬁeld are
analytic. After passing through the gain medium of
length L = 6cm,[8] these two discontinuities occur at
time t′
1,2 = t1,2 + L/c given by the phase velocity, but
not by the group velocity. Please note that the initial in-
tensity is a parabolic line in the interval (0, 0.2)µs. The
information carried by the discontinuities propagate at
the phase velocity c.

In the second example, we calculate the propagation of
the nonanalytical disturbances in the second derivative
(see Fig.3). There are two such discontinities at time
t1 = −4.8µs and t2 = 4.8µs (see Fig.3). The analyti-
cal disturbances in the 2nd order derivative of the out-
put ﬁeld after passing through the gain medium arrive at
t′
1,2 = t1,2+L/c (same as passing through vacuum). That

4

|ω| → ∞).
In this case, we can again show that the
propagation of any nonanalytical disturbance is at the
speed of c/n0 (the phase velocity).

We have proved that the information carried by the
nonanalytical disturbances in the amplitude or in its any
order derivatives (including the front of a pulse) propa-
gates with the phase velocity, but not the group velocity.
Our proof is based only on Maxwell’s electromagnetic
theory and the Kramers-Kronig relations without any
condition on whether the medium is normal or anoma-
lous. We believe this is why Einstein only considered the
phase velocity in his relativity theory.

FIG. 3: The intensities and their 2nd order derivatives of
the output ﬁeld after passing through the gain medium (solid
lines) and the same distance vacuum (dashed lines). The
input ﬁeld is E(0, t) = A[1 + cos(πt/2.4)] when −7.2 < t <
−4.8 and 4.8 < t < 7.2, E(0, t) = A[1.5+0.5 cos(πt/2.4)] when
−4.8 < t < 4.8, and otherwise E(0, t) = 0. The parameter of
the medium is the same as WKD’s experiment [8].

is to say, these two nonanalytical disturbances (the en-
coded information) propagate through the gain medium
with the phase velocity c. From the expression of the
input ﬁeld, we know that there are two more nonalytical
disturbances in the third derivative of the input intensity
at time t3 = −7.2µs and t4 = 7.2µs. The disturbances in
the third derivatives propagate also at the phase velocity
c.

In the two examples of numerical calculation, we used
a gain medium of the type considered in the experiment
[8] with anomalous dispersion. Here we would like to
note that the Kramers-Kronig relations is applicable to
the gain mediun. To our knowledge there is no dielectric
media that do not obey the Kramers-Kronig relations.
We also calculated the propagation time for the normal
dispersive media. The calculations conﬁrm the same re-
sult that the nonanlytical disturbances propagate at the
phase velocity, although the group velocities of these me-
dia are smaller than the phase velocity.

For a practical medium, the background refraction in-
dex of the medium always exists. In this case, we can
write n(ω) = n0 + ¯n(ω) ( n0 is the backgroud refrac-
tive index and is larger than unity, and ¯n(ω) → 0 as

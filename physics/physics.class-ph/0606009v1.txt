Abstract

The Lorentz transformations are represented on the ball of
relativistically admissible velocities by Einstein velocity addi-
tion and rotations. This representation is by projective maps.
The relativistic dynamic equation can be derived by intro-
ducing a new principle which is analogous to the Einstein’s
Equivalence Principle, but can be applied for any force. By
this principle, the relativistic dynamic equation is deﬁned by
an element of the Lie algebra of the above representation.

If we introduce a new dynamic variable, called symmetric
velocity, the above representation becomes a representation by
conformal, instead of projective maps. In this variable, the rel-
ativistic dynamic equation for systems with an invariant plane,
becomes a non-linear analytic equation in one complex vari-
able. We obtain explicit solutions for the motion of a charge in
uniform, mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
By the above principle, we show that the relativistic dy-
namic equation for the four-velocity leads to an analog of the
electromagnetic tensor. This indicates that force in special
relativity is described by a diﬀerential two-form.

1 Introduction

In Part 1 we have shown that from the Principle of Relativity alone,
we can infer that there are only two possibilities for space time trans-
formations between inertial systems: the Galilean transformations or
the Lorentz transformations. In Special Relativity we use the Lorentz
transformation and obtain interval conservation. We also show that
the set of all relativistically allowed velocities is a ball Dv ∈ R3 of ra-
dius c-the speed of light. We have shown that similar results hold for
proper-velocity-time transformations between accelerated systems.

If an object moves in an inertial system K ′ with uniform velocity
u and K ′ moves parallel to K with relative velocity b, then in system
K the object has uniform velocity b ⊕ u, the relativistic sum of b
and u, deﬁned as

b ⊕ u =

b + uk + αu⊥
1 + hb|ui
c2

,

(1)

where uk denotes the component of u parallel to b, u⊥ denotes the
1 − |b|2/c2. This
component of u perpendicular to b and α =
is the well-known Einstein velocity addition formula. Note that the
velocity addition is commutative only for parallel velocities. The
Lorentz transformation preserves the velocity ball Dv and acts on it
by

p

ϕb(u) = b ⊕ u.

(2)

It can be shown [2] that the map ϕb is a projective (preserving line
segments) automorphism of Dv.

We denote by Autp(Dv) the group of all projective automorphisms
of the domain Dv. The map ϕb belongs to Autp(Dv). Let ψ be
any projective automorphism of Dv. Set b = ψ(0) and U = ϕ−1
b ψ.
Then U is an isometry and represented by an orthogonal matrix.
Thus, the group Autp(Dv) of all projective automorphisms has the
characterization

Autp(Dv) = {ϕbU : b ∈ Dv, U ∈ O(3)}.

(3)

This group represents the velocity transformation between two arbi-
trary inertial systems and provides a representation of the Lorentz
group.

Now we are going to adapt Newton’s classical dynamics law

to special relativity. By deﬁnition, a force generates a change of
velocity. Since in special relativity the velocity must remain in Dv,
the changes caused by the force cannot take the velocity out of Dv.

F = ma = m

dv
dt

1

This implies that on the boundary of the domain Dv, the changes
caused by the force cannot have a non-zero component normal to the
boundary of the domain and facing outward. One of the common
ways to solve this problem is to assume that the mass m approaches
inﬁnity as the velocity approaches the boundary of Dv.

We consider the mass of an object to be an intrinsic characteristic
of the object. We therefore keep the mass constant and equal to the
so-called rest-mass m0. Under such an assumption we must give up
the property that the force on an object is independent of the velocity
of the object, since such a force would take the velocity out of Dv.
Note that also in non-relativistic mechanics we have forces which
depend on the velocity, like friction and the magnetic force.

To derive the relativistic dynamics equation, we must introduce
a new axiom which will allow us to derive such an equation. For
alternative axioms used by others, see Rindler [5], p.109. Based on
this new axiom, we will derive a relativistic dynamics equation. Our
equation agrees with the known relativistic dynamics equation ob-
tained by diﬀerent assumptions. The diﬀerence will be only in the
interpretation and the derivation of the equation.

2 Extended Partial Equivalence Principle

—EP 2

We base our additional axiom for relativistic dynamics on Einstein’s
Equivalence Principle. In the context of ﬂat space-time, the Principle
of Equivalence states that “the laws of physics have the same form
in a uniformly accelerated system as they have in an unaccelerated
inertial system in a uniform gravitational ﬁeld.” This means that
the evolution of an object in an inertial system K under a uniform
gravitational ﬁeld or gravitational force is the same as the free motion
of the object in the system K ′ moving with uniform acceleration with
respect to K.

We denote the relative velocity of the system K ′ with respect
to K caused by this uniform acceleration by b(t) and assume that
b(0) = 0. Since in the system K ′ the motion of the object is free,
its velocity u(t′) there is constant and is equal to its initial velocity
u(t′) = v0. By (2), the velocity of the object in system K is

v(t) = b(t) ⊕ u(t′) = b(t) ⊕ v0 = ϕb(t)(v0).

(4)

In particular, b(t) is the velocity at time t of an object moving under
the force of our gravitational ﬁeld which was at rest at t = 0.

From this observation, we see that the Principle of Equivalence
provides a connection between the action of a force on an object
with zero initial condition and its action on an object with nonzero

2

initial condition. Moreover, equation (4) implies that a uniform grav-
itational force in Special Relativity deﬁnes an evolution on the ve-
locity ball Dv which is given by a diﬀerentiable curve g(t) = ϕb(t) ∈
Autp(Dv), with g(0) = ϕ0,I -the identity of Autp(Dv). Thus, from the
deﬁnition of the Lie algebra autp(Dv) as generators of such curves,
we conclude that the action of a uniform gravitational ﬁeld on the
velocity ball Dv is given by an element of the Lie algebra autp(Dv).
We extend the Equivalence Principle to a form which will make
it valid for any force, not only gravity and call this the “Extended
Partial Equivalence Principle” - EP 2 for short. The statement of
this principle is: The evolution of an object in an inertial system
under a uniform force is the same as a free evolution of the same (or
similar) object in a uniformly accelerated system. Since the action
of the gravitational force on an object is independent of the object’s
properties, the EP 2 for the gravitational force holds for any object,
not only for the same one.

According to the above argument, formula (4) will hold for any
force satisfying EP 2, not only the gravity satisfying EP . This means
that the velocity of an object under a uniform force satisfying EP 2
in relativistic dynamics is

v(t) = b(t) ⊕ v0,

(5)

where b(t) is the velocity evolution of a similar object with zero initial
velocity and v0 is the initial velocity of the object. It can be shown
that the solution of the usual relativistic dynamics equation satisﬁes
this property. Also, as above, the action of any uniform force (on
given objects) on the velocity ball Dv is given by an element of the
Lie algebra autp(Dv).

Note that forces satisfying the EP 2 do not generate rotations
and thus are represented by a subset of autp(Dv) which is not a
Lie algebra. Thus, in order to obtain a Lorentz invariant relativistic
dynamic equation we must assume that a force can be represented by
an arbitrary element of the Lie algebra autp(Dv). This will allow the
force to have a rotational component as well. In the next section, we
derive the Relativistic Dynamic equation for forces satisfying EP 2
implying that they are elements of autp(Dv).

3 Relativistic Dynamics on the velocity

ball

To deﬁne the elements of autp(Dv), consider diﬀerentiable curves
g(t) from a neighborhood I0 of 0 into Autp(Dv), with g(0) = ϕ0,I ,
the identity of Autp(Dv). According to (3), any such g(t) has the
form

g(t) = ϕb(t)U (t),

(9)

where b : I0 → Dv is a diﬀerentiable function satisfying b(0) = 0
and U (t) : I0 → O(3) is diﬀerentiable and satisﬁes U (0) = I. We
denote by δ the element of autp(Dv) generated by g(t). By direct
calculation (see [2], p.35), we get

where × denotes the vector product in R3. Thus, the Lie algebra

where δE,B : Dv → R3 is the vector ﬁeld deﬁned by

δE,B(v) = E +

× B − c−2hv |Eiv.

(10)

v
c

Note that any δE,B(v) is a polynomial in v of degree less than
or equal to 2. This is a general property of the Lie algebra of the
automorphism group of a Bounded Symmetric Domain, see [2]. The
ball Dv is a Bounded Symmetric Domain with the automorphism
group Autp(Dv) of projective maps and autp(Dv) is its Lie algebra.
It is known that the elements of the Lie algebra of a Bounded Sym-
metric Domain are uniquely described by a triple product, called the
JB∗ triple product. The elements of autp(Dv) transform between
two inertial systems in the same way as the transformation of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld strength.

Under our assumption, the force is an element of autp(Dv). Thus,
the equation of evolution of a charged particle with charge q and
rest-mass m0 using the generator δE,B ∈ autp(Dv) is deﬁned by

Thus, the ﬂow generated by an electromagnetic ﬁeld is deﬁned
by elements of the Lie algebra autp(Dv), which are, in turn, vec-
tor ﬁeld polynomials in v of degree 2. The linear term of this ﬁeld
comes from the magnetic force, while the constant and the quadratic
terms come from the electric ﬁeld. If the electromagnetic ﬁeld E, B
is constant, then for any given τ , the solution of (12) is an element
ϕb(τ ),U(τ ) ∈ Autp(Dv) and the set of such elements form a one-
parameter subgroup of Autp(Dv). This subgroup is a geodesic of
the metric invariant under the group.

If we set B = 0 and denote F = qE, we obtain the dynamics equa-
tion of evolution in relativistic mechanics. Thus, also in relativistic
mechanics the force is deﬁned by an element of autp(Dv).

If the electromagnetic ﬁeld is not uniform, it is deﬁned by E(t, r)
and B(t, r) which are dependent on space and time. In this case, the
action of the ﬁeld is on a ﬁbre-bundle with Minkowski space-time as
base and Dv as the ﬁbre. The ﬁeld acts on the ﬁbre over the point
(t, r) as δE(t,r),B(t,r)(v), deﬁned by (10).

4 Symmetric velocity dynamics

Explicit solution of the evolution equation (12) exists only for con-
stant electric E or constant magnetic B ﬁelds.
If both ﬁelds are
present, even in the case where there is an invariant plane and the
problem can be reduced to one complex variable, there are no direct
explicit solutions. The reason for this is that equation (12) is not
complex analytic. Complex analyticity is connected with conformal
maps, while the transformations on the velocity ball are projective.
All currently known explicit solutions [1],[7] and [4] use some sub-
stitutions such that in the new variable the transformations become
conformal.

To obtain explicit solutions for motion of a charge in constant,
uniform, and mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic ﬁelds, we
associate with any velocity v a new dynamic variable called the sym-
metric velocity ws. The symmetric velocity ws and its corresponding
velocity v are related by

v = ws ⊕ ws =

2ws
1 + |ws|2/c2 .

The physical meaning of this velocity is explained in Figure 1.

Instead of ws, we shall ﬁnd it more convenient to use the unit-
free vector w = ws/c, which we call the s-velocity. The relation of a
velocity v to its corresponding s-velocity is

(13)

(14)

v = Φ(w) =

2cw
1 + |w|2 ,

5

Figure 1: The physical meaning of symmetric velocity. Two inertial
systems K and K ′ with relative velocity v between them are viewed
from the system connected to their center. In this system, K and K ′
are each moving with velocity ±w.

where Φ denotes the function mapping the s-velocity w to its corre-
sponding velocity v. The s-velocity has some interesting and useful
mathematical properties. The set of all three-dimensional relativisti-
cally admissible s-velocities forms a unit ball

Ds = {w ∈ R3 : |w| < 1}.

(15)

Corresponding to the Einstein velocity addition equation, we may

deﬁne an addition of s-velocities in Ds such that

Φ(b ⊕s w) = Φ(b) ⊕E Φ(w).

(16)

A straightforward calculation leads to the corresponding equation for
s-velocity addition:

b ⊕s w =

(1 + |w|2 + 2 < b | w >)b + (1 − |b|2)w
1 + |b|2|w|2 + 2 < b | w >

.

(17)

Equation (17) can be put into a more convenient form if, for any

b ∈ Ds, we deﬁne a map Ψb : Ds → Ds by

ψb(w) ≡ b ⊕s w.

(18)

This map is an extension to Ds ∈ Rn of the M¨obius addition on the
complex unit disc. It deﬁnes a conformal map on Ds. The motion

6

of a charge in E × B ﬁelds is two-dimensional if the charge starts in
the plane perpendicular to B, and in this case Eq.(17) for s-velocity
addition is somewhat simpler. By introducing a complex structure
on the plane Π, which is perpendicular to B, the disk ∆ = Ds ∩ Π
can be identiﬁed as a unit disc |w| < 1 called the Poincar´e disc. In
this case the s-velocity addition deﬁned by Eq.(17) becomes

a ⊕s w = ψa(w) =

(19)

a + w
1 + aw

,

which is the well-known M¨obius transformation of the unit disk.

By using the s velocity we can rewrite ( as in [2]) the relativistic

Lorentz force equation

E + cw × B − w < w|E >,

(20)

which is the relativistic Lorentz force equation for the s-velocity w
as a function of the proper time τ .

We now use Eq.(20) to ﬁnd the s-velocity of a charge q in uniform,
constant, and mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
Since all of the terms on the right hand side of Eq. (20) are in the
plane perpendicular to B, if w is in the plane Π perpendicular to B,
then dw/dτ is also in Π. Consequently, if the initial s-velocity is in
the plane perpendicular to B, w will remain in the this plane and
the motion will be two dimensional.

Working in Cartesian coordinates, we choose

E = (0, E, 0), B = (0, 0, B), and w = (w1, w2, 0).

5 Relativistic Dynamics of the four-velocity

In this section we will use four-velocity instead of velocity to describe
the relativistic evolution.

To deﬁne the four velocity, we consider the Lorentz space-time
transformation between two inertial systems K ′ and K with axes
chosen to be parallel. We assume that K ′ moves with respect to K

only the change of the position of an object but also the change of
the time rate of the clock comoving with the object.

Here too, we will assume the EP 2 principle, which implies that
the acceleration of an object under a given force in an inertial system
K is equivalent to free motion in system K ′ moving with a variable
relative velocity b(t) with respect to K. Also here we may assume
that b(0) = 0. Denote the initial velocity of the object in K ′ by v.
Since the motion of the object in system K ′ is free, the velocity of the

object will remain constant in K ′. The four-velocity ˜v = γ(v)

c
v (cid:19)
will also remain constant. We denote the proper time of the object
by τ . By use of (47) and (48) and the well-known formulas (see
[2]) for relativistic velocity addition and the transformation of the
corresponding γ’s, we can calculate the world-line of the the object
in K as

This shows that Lb(t)˜v = ^b ⊕ v and that the four velocity transfor-
mation between K ′ and K is given by multiplication by the 4 × 4
matrix of Lb.

As a result, the relativistic acceleration, which is the generator of
the four-velocity changes, is obtained by diﬀerentiating the matrix of
Lb(t) with respect to t at t = 0. Since b(0) = 0, we have γ(b(0)) = 1

General four-velocity transformations between two inertial sys-
tems also include rotations, which can be expressed by a 3 × 3 or-
thogonal matrices U (t). We will extend such a matrix to a 4 × 4
matrix by adding zeros in the time components outside the diagonal
and assume that T (0) = I. The general four-velocity transformation
will then be

is a 3 × 3 antisymmetric matrix.

We have seen that relativistic acceleration includes both linear
and rotational acceleration and is a linear map on the four-velocities.
The matrix representing the relativistic acceleration is antisymmet-
ric if both indices are space indices or both are time indices and is
symmetric if one of the indices is spacial and the other is a temporal.
Moreover, any relativistic force, which is a multiple of the relativistic
acceleration by m0, must have the form of the electromagnetic tensor

In classical mechanics, a force was represented by a diﬀerential
one-form which expressed the change of the velocity and space dis-
placement of the object in the direction of the force. In special rela-
tivity, a force (a non-rotating one) causes more change then it causes
in classical mechanics. It also causes a change in the rate of a clock
connected to the object due to the change of the magnitude of the
object’s velocity. Thus, it has to be represented by a diﬀerential two-
form. On the other hand, forces causing rotation, like the magnetic
force need to be described by diﬀerential two-forms also in classical
mechanics. Thus, only in relativistic dynamics can these two forces
be combined eﬀectively as a single force.

6 Discussion

We have shown that an analog of the Equivalence Principle leads
to the known relativistic dynamic equation. The relativistic force
is deﬁned by an element of the Lie algebra of the group Autp(Dv)
of projective automorphisms of the ball of relativistically admissi-
ble velocities Dv. This Lie algebra is a quadratic polynomial on
Dv where the constant and quadratic coeﬃcients deﬁne an analog of
electric force, while the linear term corresponds to a magnetic force.
Such decomposition exists for any force in relativity. The Lie alge-
bra autp(Dv) is described by the triple product associated with the
domain Dv which is a domain of type I in Cartan’s classiﬁcation.

The relativistic force on a new dynamic variable - symmetric
velocity- is an element of autc(Ds)- the Lie algebra of the conformal
group on the ball of relativistically admissible symmetric velocities
Ds. For velocities with the speed of light, the symmetric velocity
and the regular velocity are equal. This explains the known fact that
the Maxwell equations (related to electro-magnetic propagation with
the speed of light) are invariant under the conformal group. But
in order to obtain conformal transformation for massive particles we
must use symmetric velocity instead of the regular velocity. The use
of symmetric velocity helps to ﬁnd analytic solutions for relativistic
dynamic equations.

The Lie algebra autc(Ds) is described by the triple product asso-
ciated with the domain Ds. In this case, this is a domain of type IV
in Cartan’s classiﬁcation, called the Spin factor. A complexiﬁcation
of this domain leads to Dirac bispinors, an analog of the geometric
product of Cliﬀord algebras. We also obtain both spin 1 and spin 1/2
representations of the Lorentz group on this domain, see [3]. This may
provide a connection between Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.

By applying the analog of the Equivalence Principle to the four-
velocity we showed that the relativistic dynamics equation leads to
an analog of the electro-magnetic tensor.

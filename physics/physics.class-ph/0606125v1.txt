Stability of an electromagnetically levitated
spherical sample in a set of coaxial circular loops

J¯anis Priede and Gunter Gerbeth

Abstract— This paper presents a theoretical study of oscillatory
and rotational instabilities of a solid spherical body levitated
electromagnetically in axisymmetric coils made of coaxial circular
loops. We apply our previous theory to analyze the static and
dynamic stability of the sample depending on the AC frequency
and the position of the sample in the coils for several simple
conﬁgurations. An original analytical approach is introduced
employing a gauge transformation for the vector potential. First
we calculate the spring constants which deﬁne the frequency of
small-amplitude oscillations. For static stability the spring con-
stants must be positive. Dynamic instabilities are characterized by
critical AC frequencies which, when exceeded, may result either
in a spin-up or oscillations with increasing amplitude. It is found
that the critical frequencies increase with the non-uniformity
of the ﬁeld. We show that for a spherically harmonic ﬁeld the
critical frequency for the spin-up instability in a ﬁeld of degree l
coincides with the critical frequency for the oscillatory instability
in a ﬁeld of degree l + 1.

I. INTRODUCTION

E LECTROMAGNETIC levitation melting (ELM) was in-

vented in the twenties of the last century [1] whereas
its usage started only at the beginning of the ﬁfties [2] when
high-frequency power generators became available. The basic
principle of ELM is simple: a conducting sample, usually
metallic, weighting from several tens of grams up to several
kilograms is placed in a coil fed by an AC current with a
typical frequency ranging from about 10 kHz up to several
100 kHz. The AC magnetic ﬁeld induces eddy currents in
the sample which, in turn, give rise to two effects. On one
hand, eddy currents interact with those in the coil giving rise
to a Lorentz force that repels the sample from the coil. On
the other hand, the Ohmic dissipation due to the induced
currents provides heating of the sample. In such a way, the
sample can be levitated and also melted, provided that the
coil conﬁguration and the current in it are properly adjusted.
ELM is particularly useful for melting reactive metals with
high melting points, for example such as Ti, Zr, V, Ta, Mo,
which often react with the crucible material and so get polluted
by it [2]. ELM avoids contamination of the melt and allows
one to carry out solidiﬁcation from deeply under-cooled states

which is of interest for certain material science applications
[3]. Besides, ELM is a well-known method for measurements
of material properties of liquid metals used on ground as well
as in space [4], [5].

The balance of gravity and electromagnetic forces is neces-
sary but not sufﬁcient for a successful levitation. In addition,
the sample has to be stable at least to perturbations of sufﬁ-
ciently small amplitude. First, it means that the reaction force
due to the displacement of the sample from its equilibrium
position has to act against that displacement. Otherwise, the
equilibrium will be statically unstable and the solid sample
will fall out of the coil or touch it when it
is slightly
perturbed. Similarly, a molten sample may leak out of the
coil in the result of surface folding and deformation [6]. The
static stability alone may also be insufﬁcient for a successful
levitation because sometimes the sample exhibits overstability.
Namely, there is a restoring force that makes the sample
to execute oscillations with increasing amplitude so that the
sample eventually hits the coil or leaves it [2]. Similarly,
sometimes the sample is observed to spin-up [2], [7], [8].
A purely electromagnetic theory trying to account for such
dynamic instabilities has been proposed in our previous work
and applied to some simple conﬁgurations of magnetic ﬁelds
[9], [10]. In this study, we apply our previous theory to analyze
both the static and dynamic stability of a spherical sample in
more realistic axisymmetric magnetic systems made of a set of
coaxial circular current loops. Although the basic conﬁguration
is axisymmetric, the perturbation ﬁelds are, in general, three-
dimensional that renders the problem mathematically more
complicated. To calculate 3D ﬁelds for a spherical sample we
use similar analytic techniques as in Refs. [11], [12]. However,
our approach differs from the previous ones by an original use
of the gauge transformation for the 3D vector potential in order
to satisfy boundary conditions for the induced current. This
allows us to carry out the analysis only in terms of the vector
potential without considering the scalar electrostatic potential.
Therefore our approach is considerably simpler compared to
[11], [12].

The paper is organized as follows. The stability of small
amplitude oscillations of arbitrary direction is considered in
Sec. 2 beginning with the governing equations and analytic
solutions for the vector potential of a circular current loop in
spherical harmonics. In this section we also derive solutions
for the axisymmetric base state and the perturbation ﬁeld
due to a small displacement. Section 3 presents governing
equations and analytic solution for the spin-up instability. Nu-
merical results for both instabilities in several simple inductors

A. Formulation of the problem and governing equations

Consider a sphere with radius R and conductivity σ moving
at velocity v in a magnetic ﬁeld B alternating with circular
frequency ω. The induced electric ﬁeld follows from the ﬁrst
∇Φ
Maxwell equation as E =
∂tA, where Φ is the scalar
potential of the electric ﬁeld and A is the vector potential of
the magnetic ﬁeld. The density of the electric current induced
in a moving medium is given by Ohm’s law

1) Magnetic ﬁeld of a circular loop in spherical harmonics:
The magnetic ﬁeld of an inductor consisting of a set of coaxial
circular loops represents a superposition of the ﬁelds of the
separate loops. Therefore, we ﬁrst consider a single loop lying
y plane and centered with respect to the
parallel to the x
z-axis of a Cartesian coordinate system with a sphere at its
origin, see Fig. 1. Approximation of a toroidal inductor of
small cross-section by a circular loop is considered in more
detail in Appendix 1. The loop is supplied with an AC current
with amplitude I0 alternating harmonically with a circular
frequency ω as I0 cos(ωt). Henceforth we use the magnetic
diffusion time τm = µ0σR2 and the radius of the sphere R as
time and length scales while the current density and the vector
potential are scaled by I0/R2 and µ0I0, respectively. In the
following, we assume all quantities to be dimensionless with
the same notation as for the dimensional counterparts used
so far. Further we consider the vector potential generated by
the loop Ae(r, t) = Ae
0(r) cos(¯ωt) with the axisymmetric
amplitude Ae
0(r), where ¯ω = ωµ0σR2 is the dimensionless

non-axisymmetric perturbation Ae
1(r). The perturbation of the
inner ﬁeld A1 is governed by the same Eqs. (6, 7) as the base
ﬁeld with the difference that now the external ﬁeld is given
by Ae
1(r). Consequently, the perturbation of the inner ﬁeld
and the corresponding induced ﬁeld outside the sphere can be
obtained straightforwardly by replacing the coefﬁcients I m
by J m
in the corresponding solutions (8, 9) for the base ﬁeld.
l
Although the solution of the perturbed ﬁeld obtained in such
a way satisﬁes (6, 7) and the boundary conditions, it turns out
that the induced ﬁeld outside does not satisfy the Coulomb
gauge unless the problem is axisymmetric, i.e., the offset is
along the symmetry axis. Thus, although the Laplace equation
is satisﬁed we formally have ∇
1 =
ji
= 0 which implies that the current is leaking outside the
1 6
sphere. In addition note that the continuity of the tangential
components of induction following from the continuity of the
vector potential and its normal derivative at the surface of the
sphere ensures continuity of the radial, i.e. normal, component
r). Thus,
of the current because r
·
the vector potential satisfying the Laplace equation and the
Coloumb gauge outside the sphere and being continuous at
the surface ensures that the current is closed in the sphere.
As shown above, the induced vector potential unambiguously
follows from the imposed one. Thus,
the induced vector
potential can be modiﬁed only by changing the imposed one.
This can be done by employing the gauge invariance which
allows us to add to the external vector potential Ae

gradient of some gauge potential deﬁned as

Γ are the effective electromagnetic stiffness
where K and
and damping tensors, respectively. Further we refer to the
elements of K and Γ as the spring constants and growth
rates, respectively. Note that due to the axial symmetry both
K and Γ are purely diagonal matrices with zero azimuthal
components. At ﬁrst, the axial symmetry implies that a purely
axial displacement gives rise to a similar reaction force.
Second, if the displacement is purely radial the reaction force,
on the one hand, has to change to the opposite together with
the displacement because of linearity but, on the other hand,
it has to rotate around the symmetry axis together with the
latter. Thus, a purely radial displacement causes a purely
radial reaction force and, therefore, both K and Γ are purely
diagonal. Both diagonal elements of K have to be positive
for the static stability whereas the corresponding growth rates
the
have to be negative for dynamic stability. Note that
growth rates can become positive and, thus, destabilizing when
the dimensionless AC frequency exceeds a certain threshold
depending on the conﬁguration of the ﬁeld [10]. Both the
spring constants and the growth rates can be calculated for the

angular velocity Ω in an alternating magnetic ﬁeld. The
density of the induced current is given by Ohm’s law for a
moving medium

Note that this equation governs the vector potential in the
laboratory frame of reference where the body rotates while
the source of the magnetic ﬁeld is at rest. Further we proceed
to the frame of reference rotating together with the sphere. In
a rotating frame of reference, where the sphere is at rest while

time-dependence of the external magnetic ﬁeld modulating the
time-dependence of the applied magnetic ﬁeld.

B. Analytical solution

Further we consider a sphere rotating about an axis per-
pendicular to the symmetry axis of an axisymmetric external
magnetic ﬁeld of a circular loop. The coordinate system related
to the loop with the z axis as symmetry axis is chosen so that
the rotation takes place about the x-axis, as shown in Fig. 1.
It is convenient to analyze this rotation in a coordinate system
turned about the y-axis by 90 degrees so that the z′-axis of the
transformed coordinate system coincides with the original x-
axis which is the axis of rotation and, respectively, the x′-axis
is directed opposite to the z axis of the original coordinate
system. Then the basis vectors of both coordinate systems are
ez, e′y = ey, and e′z = ex. Respectively,
related as e′x =

the complex unity vector is eη = 1

Now we can simply proceed to the frame of reference rotating
together with the sphere by redeﬁning the azimuthal angle
as φ′ = φ′′ + ¯Ωt, where φ′′ is the azimuthal angle in the
rotating frame of reference and ¯Ω is the dimensionless angular
velocity of rotation. Respectively, the complex unit vector and
the spherical harmonics change in a rotating frame of reference

For the rest state of the sphere to be stable to rotational
perturbations, the torque caused by these perturbations has to
damp them that corresponds to ∂ ¯ΩM < 0. In the opposite case,
the rest state is unstable. The state is marginally stable when
∂ ¯ΩM (¯ωc) = 0, which is the equation deﬁning the critical
frequency ¯ωc for the spin-up instability.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

A. Small-amplitude oscillations

In the following we present some numerical results for
an inductor consisting of two circular loops of equal radii
placed coaxially at the distance H from the mid-plane. The
current having the same amplitude may ﬂow either in the same
or in opposite directions in both loops. Subsequently, both
these cases are referred to as symmetric and antisymmetric,
respectively. We start with a simple symmetric case when
both loops coincide (H = 0) making up a single loop with
doubled current amplitude. The forces along with axial and
radial spring constants versus the distance of the sphere from
such a loop of dimensionless radius R = 2 are shown in
Fig. 2 for various dimensionless frequencies. As seen in Fig.
2(a), at large enough distances the force, which is repulsing,
raises with decreasing distance between the loop and the
sphere. At some distance, the force attains a maximum and
tends to zero as the sphere approaches the center of the loop.
Such a reducing force implies that the position of the sphere
is statically unstable to axial perturbations. The position is
statically stable to axial perturbations when the axial spring
constants shown in Fig. 2(b) are positive that requires the
sphere to be placed further away from the loop than the point
0.75. A position being
of maximum force which is at z
axially stable may become unstable radially when the distance
from the loop becomes too large (see Fig. 2b). Thus the range
of statically stable positions for a single loop is rather limited
(0.75 < z < 1.5) and does not change signiﬁcantly with the
frequency of the magnetic ﬁeld.

∞

Further let us turn brieﬂy to the static stability of a sphere
in an arrangement of two coaxial current loops of the same
radius placed symmetrically at distance H from the center of
the sphere. For the sake of brevity we restrict the static stability
analysis to the perfect-conductor approximation ¯ω =
. Axial
and radial spring constants are shown in Fig. 3 versus the
distance H at various radii of the loops for both symmetric and
antisymmetric arrangements. In the symmetric arrangement,
which is usually used for heating, the position of the sphere is
statically unstable in radial direction when the loops are too
much separated, and it becomes unstable in the axial direction
when the loops are moved too tightly together. Overlapping of
the stability ranges for radial and axial perturbations depends
on the radius of the loops. For R = 2 the range of axial
stability ends at H
1 where the range of radial stability
begins. Thus, there is no overlapping of the stability ranges
in this case that implies a static instability regardless of the

≈

distance between the loops. A range of positions statically
stable to both axial and radial perturbations is possible only for
sufﬁciently small radii of the loops. For instance at R = 1.25
this range is approximately 0.5 < z < 0.75. In contrast to
the symmetric arrangement, an antisymmetric one, which is
usually used for positioning of the sample, ensures a statically
stable state to radial perturbations regardless of the distance
between the loops (see Fig. 3b on right). The position of the
sphere is stable to axial perturbations for any radius of the
loop provided the loops are separated by a distance larger
than the radius of the sphere (H > 0.5). There might be an
axial instability for smaller separations of the loops at R < 2
(see Fig. 3a on right).

Forces together with axial and radial spring constants versus
the distance of the sphere from the mid-plane of both symmet-
ric and antisymmetric arrangements of two loops are shown in
Fig. 4 for various distances between the loops in the perfect-

conductor approximation (¯ω =
). It is seen that the position
of the sphere in the middle-point (z = 0) of a symmetric
arrangement (Fig. 4 on left) is unstable either in radial or axial
directions for almost all distances between the coils. However,
there is one distance between the coils, H
1, at which
both spring constants cross zero almost simultaneously. Thus,
this distance is an optimal one for the static stability of the
sphere in the middle-point. Note that the distance H = R/2
provides the most uniform magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of the
middle-point of the symmetric arrangement. This is because
the next to the leading order contribution for the magnetic
ﬁeld of symmetric arrangement vanishes at the aspect ratio
H/R = cot θ0 = 0.5, i.e., P 1
3 (cos θ0) = 0 in (5). Similarly,
the distance H = R√3/2 providing the most uniform gradient
of the magnetic ﬁeld in the vicinity of the middle-point of an
antisymmetric arrangement is expected to ensure the widest
range of statically stable positions for loops of large enough
radius.

The dynamic stability of small-amplitude radial and axial
oscillations is characterized by the corresponding growth rates
Γrr and Γzz deﬁned by (13). The threshold of linear stability
is given by the frequency above which the corresponding
growth rate becomes positive. At the threshold frequency, the
amplitude of oscillations turns from decaying to growing in

time. A characteristic feature of this instability is that the
growth rate, becoming positive above the threshold frequency,
reaches a maximum at a certain frequency and tends to zero
at higher frequencies. The frequency at which the growth rate
attains a maximum is referred to as the most dangerous one.
Threshold frequencies along with the most dangerous one and
the corresponding maximal growth rates are plotted in Fig.
5 versus the half-distance between the loops at various radii
of the loops for both axial and radial oscillations of a sphere
about the middle-point of both symmetric and antisymmetric
arrangements of two loops. The most dangerous frequency is
always above the threshold one. As seen in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b),
at large enough distances between the loops, the threshold and
the most dangerous frequencies tend to ¯ωc = 27.682 and ¯ωd =
47.196 in the symmetric arrangement, and to ¯ωc = 11.609
and ¯ωd = 18.792 in the antisymmetric one, respectively. Note
that these critical frequencies for the oscillatory instability
in spatially quadratic and linear magnetic ﬁelds coincide
with those for the spin-up instability in linear and uniform
magnetic ﬁelds, respectively, which will be considered later.
For each radius of a symmetric arrangement, there is a certain
optimal distance between the loops that maximizes the critical
frequency. For large enough radii the optimal distance between
the loops is approximately equal to the radius, 2H = R,

which is optimal also for the static stability as considered
above. With decreasing of the loop radius, the optimal distance
becomes slightly larger (see Figs. 5a and 5b on left). In the
antisymmetric case, the critical frequency changes weakly on
reducing of the distance H until the loops approach a distance
0.75 to the mid-plane (see Figs. 5a and 5b on right).
H
Further approaching of the loops results in the increase of the
critical frequency which is the larger, the smaller the radius.
This raise is caused by the nonuniformity of the magnetic ﬁeld
in the vicinity of the loop. Although the critical frequency
for axial oscillations is, in general, slightly lower than that
for the radial oscillations, there is no signiﬁcant difference
between both. The maximal growth rate for the symmetric case
changes weakly with reducing distance between the loops until
the distance becomes comparable to the radius of the sphere
(z
0.5) (see Figs. 5c and 5d on left). Closer approaching of
the loops causes a signiﬁcant increase of the growth rate for
both axial and radial oscillations. Again, the smaller the radius
of the loops, the larger the increase of the growth rate. In the
antisymmetric case, the growth rate reaches a maximum as
the loops approach to the mid-plane at a distance comparable
to the radius of the sphere (z
1) (see Figs. 5c and 5d on
right).

B. Spin-up instability

Spin-up instability occurs when the frequency of the alter-
nating magnetic ﬁeld exceeds the threshold ¯ωc deﬁned above.
The spin-up rate being proportional to ∂ ¯ΩM becomes positive
as the frequency raises over the threshold and attains a max-
imum at some higher frequency ¯ωd subsequently referred to
as the most dangerous one. These critical frequencies together
with the corresponding maximal spin-up rates for a sphere
at
the middle-point between symmetric and antisymmetric
arrangements of two loops are plotted in Fig. 6 versus the half-
distance between the loops of various radii. As seen in Fig.
6(a), at large enough distances between the loops the threshold
and the most dangerous frequencies tend to ¯ωc = 11.609
and ¯ωd = 18.792 in the symmetric arrangement, and to
¯ωc = 27.682 and ¯ωd = 47.196 in the antisymmetric one,
which correspond to the spatially uniform and linear ﬁelds,
respectively. In the symmetric case, the critical frequencies
have a minimum at the distance between the loops equal
to their radius: 2H = R (see Fig. 6a on left). Note that
this is converse to the critical frequencies for the oscillatory
instability considered previously which have a maximum at
this distance. This minimum is due to the maximal uniformity
of the ﬁeld in the vicinity of the middle-point achieved at this
distance between the loops. Critical frequencies increase with
the non-uniformity of the ﬁeld which becomes particularly
signiﬁcant when the loops are approached closer than the
radius of the sphere (H
0.5). In this case, the smaller the
radius of the loops, the higher the critical frequencies. The
spin-up rate raises as the loops are approached and attains a
maximum at H
0.5. For the loops with large enough radius
the maximum of the spin-up rate is attained when both loops
merge together forming a single one (see Fig. 6b on left). In
the antisymmetric case, the critical frequencies begin to raise

≈

≈

signiﬁcantly when the loops approach to the mid-plane at a
distance of the radius of the sphere: H
1 (see Fig. 6a on
right). As seen in Fig. 6b on right, the spin-up rate attains a
maximum approximately at the same distance.

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This work presents an analytic stability analysis of a solid
sphere levitated electromagnetically in an axisymmetric mag-
netic ﬁeld induced by a set of coaxial circular loops. Stability
is considered with respect to both oscillations of small ampli-
tude and arbitrary direction and rotations perpendicular to the
axis of symmetry of the ﬁeld. Both oscillations and rotations
are found to become growing in time when the dimensionless
frequency of the ﬁeld exceeds a certain critical threshold ¯ωc
depending on the conﬁguration of the ﬁeld for each kind
of instability. The growth rates of both instabilities become
positive as the frequency is raised over the corresponding
threshold, attain a maximum at some higher frequency and
tend to zero at high frequencies. The frequency ¯ωd, at which
the maximum is attained, is referred to as the most dangerous
one for the corresponding instability. Critical frequencies and
the corresponding maximal growth rates are calculated for
arrangements of two loops of the same radius carrying the
same total current which may ﬂow either in the same or in
opposite directions. These arrangements, corresponding to the
usual heating and positioning ﬁelds, are referred to as the
symmetric and antisymmetric ones. It is found that critical
frequencies for both oscillatory and rotational
instabilities
increase with the nonuniformity of the magnetic ﬁeld. The
lowest dimensionless critical frequencies are ¯ωc = 11.609
and ¯ωd = 18.792 which are the same for both the spin-up
instability in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld and the oscillatory in-
stability in a spatially linear ﬁeld. This coincidence represents
a particular case of a more general rule: the critical frequencies
for the spin-up instability in a spherically harmonic ﬁeld of
degree l coincide with the critical frequencies for oscillatory
instability in a spherically harmonic ﬁeld of degree l + 1.
Thus, the critical frequencies ¯ωc = 27.682 and ¯ωd = 47.196
for the spin-up instability in a linear ﬁeld coincide with the
critical frequencies for the oscillatory instability in a spatially
quadratic magnetic ﬁeld which is the case at the mid-point of
a symmetric arrangement of two loops except the case that
the distance between the loops is equal to the radius of the
loops. In this particular case, the quadratic term vanishes and
the instability is dominated by the fourth-order term which has
critical frequencies ¯ωc = 85.252 and ¯ωd = 158.6. Thus, the
distance 2H = R is optimal in order to avoid the oscillatory
instability of the sphere at the mid-point of the symmetric
arrangement. This distance, which ensures the most uniform
magnetic ﬁeld at the middle-point, yields a minimum of the
critical frequency for the spin-up instability. Note that there
is no similar optimal distance for the oscillatory instability in
antisymmetric arrangement where the critical frequency can
be increased only by the nonuniformity of the magnetic ﬁeld
when the loops are approached close to the surface of the
sphere. Hence, the stabilization of a sphere by an optimal
design of the inductor is rather limited and active means of

Note that the maximal dimensionless growth rates for both

oscillatory and spin-up instabilities are small, typically Γ
∼
3. From the physical point of view we have introduced
10−
the growth rate as a viscous-type friction coefﬁcient at the
velocity. Thus the physical dimension of Γ is s/m and,
consequently, its scale is τm/R, because we have used the
magnetic diffusion time τm and the radius of the sample R
as time and length scales, respectively. In order to obtain the
actual friction force we have to take the product of velocity,
friction coefﬁcient and the magnitude of the characteristic total
electromagnetic force F0 which usually is comparable to the
gravity of the sample mg, where m is the mass of the sample
and g the free fall acceleration. By comparing the negative
effective friction force to the inertia we obtain an estimate of
R

σ
although the magnetic ﬁeld has a dynamically destabilizing
effect, the development of the instability is expected to be
very slow and, thus, hardly observable. In conclusion, note
that the frequency of the magnetic ﬁeld is the only parameter
determining the threshold of dynamic instabilities as long as

no external damping, for instance due to a surrounding gas,
is taken into account. In the opposite case, the threshold of
instability would depend not only on the frequency but also
on the amplitude of the current.

In conclusion note that the dynamic instabilities resulting
from the effect of motion of a conducting body in an AC
magnetic ﬁeld can be interpreted from an alternative physical
point of view which can explain the weakness of this insta-
bility and also suggests other possible instability mechanisms.
In the given AC magnetic ﬁeld, the electromagnetic force on
the spherical body at rest depends only on its position. If the
position changes, it takes some time for the electromagnetic
force to relax to its time-averaged stationary value for the
given position. This delay is caused by the ﬁnite time of
magnetic diffusion in the body which, taking place over the
skin depth, is thus comparable to the AC oscillation period τ.
The electromagnetic force at instant t on the body in motion
may be represented as F (r(t
τ )). Assuming a sufﬁciently
−
high AC frequency, we can expand this representation in a
power series of small τ yielding F (r(t

motion. Consequently, the delay of the magnetic ﬁeld results
in an effective electromagnetic friction force with a negative
and, thus, destabilizing friction coefﬁcient. It is important to
note that the friction coefﬁcient is small because it involves
the delay time which is short and comparable to the AC period
when the relaxation of the magnetic ﬁeld is solely due to
the electromagnetic diffusion over the skin depth. The same
arguments may be extended to the coupling of the magnetic
ﬁeld and the temperature distribution in the body caused
by its temperature-dependent electrical conductivity. In this
case, the delay of the magnetic ﬁeld would be dominated by
the thermal relaxation time which is much longer than the
electromagnetic diffusion time and, thus, expected to cause
stronger dynamic instabilities than the pure electromagnetic
mechanism considered here. In addition, the decrease of the
electrical conductivity for increasing temperature, which is
caused by the Joule heating of the AC magnetic ﬁeld, and the
related reduction of the non-dimensional frequency ¯ω might
be important in levitation experiments.

APPENDIX I
APPROXIMATION OF A TOROIDAL INDUCTOR OF SMALL
CROSS-SECTION BY A CIRCULAR LOOP

Consider a toroidal inductor of arbitrary cross-section car-
rying an axisymmetric and purely azimuthal current. The
magnetic ﬁeld of such an inductor may be represented as a
superposition of the ﬁelds of separate circular loops constitut-
ing the inductor, and the corresponding vector potential may
be written as the integral over the inductor cross-section S:
A(r) =

S A0(r, r′)ds′, where

is the nondimensionalized vector potential of a single circular
loop deﬁned by the radius vector r′ = r′e′r + z′e′z with r′
and z′ being the radius and axial position of the loop in
cylindrical coordinates. Subsequently assume the skin effect to
be negligible as if the inductor would be fed by a direct current
driven by the gradient of an electrostatic potential Φ. An
axisymmetric and purely azimuthal current distribution with
density j = jeφ implies Φ to depend solely on the azimuthal
angle φ. Consequently, j =

APPENDIX III
CALCULATION OF THE COEFFICIENTS gl(z).
The coefﬁcients gl(z) and g′l(z) in (10,13, 13) can efﬁciently
be calculated using continued fractions [16]. For this purpose
we rewrite gl(z) = jl+1(z)
1(z) where hl(z) =
jl−1(z) = hl(z)hl
jl+1(z)
and jl(z) is the spherical Bessel function of index l.
jl(z)
Further, applying a recurrence relation for the spherical Bessel
function of index l+1 we obtain the continued fraction:

allowing us to calculate hl(z) provided that hl+1(z) is

choose sufﬁciently large l′ and then truncate the fraction by
approximating hl′(z) by the previous expression that allows us
to calculate back the necessary hl(z). Note that the forward
recurrence for hl(z) is not practically applicable because it
is numerically unstable similarly to its counterpart for Bessel
functions. The other necessary quantity g′l(z) = dgl

in (13,13), can be calculated in a similar way by expressing it
as g′l(z) = (2l + 1)(h2

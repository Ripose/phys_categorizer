The physics of magnetic state change or reversal in single domain magnetic grains (called Stoner
particles) is interesting from the fundamental as well as the applied points of view. A change in
magnetization can be ﬁnely tuned with a speciﬁc time variation of an externally applied magnetic
ﬁeld. It may also occur naturally (without application of a ﬁeld) at very low temperature with quan-
tum tunneling and at higher temperature with thermal excitation. The optimal (usually shortest)
time altering the magnetisation along with the smallest applied magnetic ﬁeld are sought in tech-
nological applications such as high-density reading or writing of information, spintronics, quantum
information and quantum communication systems.
This work reviews the magnetization change with a time dependent ﬁeld and temperature and dis-
cusses the time it takes to alter the magnetization as a function of the control parameter chosen,
temperature and material parameters.

INTRODUCTION

The eﬀect of time dependent ﬁelds on magnetization state is important for the reading and writing of information
and the monitoring of the magnetization in a magnetic material. In the case of magnetic recording, when density
is increased, the grain size making the recording media decreases.
If is small enough, its magnetization becomes
extremely sensitive to thermal energy; it can ﬂip (in the vertical case) or reverse (in the horizontal case) by the
simple eﬀect of (even small) ﬁnite temperature perturbation (Brownian ﬂuctuations). This adverse eﬀect is called
super-paramagnetism that traditionally limits longitudinal recording of hard disks to densities on the order of 100
Gbits/in2. Longitudinal refers to the fact the rotation velocity of the disk is parallel to the magnetization orientation.
Progress in size reduction toward the nanometer paves the way to new opportunities in the emerging ﬁeld of
spintronics. On that scale, we have a wide panel of physical eﬀects (e.g. new types of quantum exchange between
nanometer thick magnetic layers) and the spin diﬀusion length becomes long enough to maintain useful spin orienta-
tion... Novel nanometric magnetic devices are good candidates for use as building blocks of spintronics (spin diode or
spin transistor) or quantum information systems. The latter span quantum information storage (Q-bits...), quantum
computing (quantum logic operations like the square root of the N OT operation (√N OT ) or the controlled N OT op-
eration (CN OT ) etc...), quantum communication systems (an example is entanglement that means that measurement
performed on one system seems to be instantaneously inﬂuencing other systems related to it) or Quantum Metrology.
It is important to be able to tell how one might be able to alter their state with a magnetic ﬁeld, or how their states
might be aﬀected by temperature as in the recording case.

The time it takes for an eﬀect to take place is also important.

In recording, given a ﬁxed rotational velocity
of the hard disk (typically 7200 rpm) the decrease of bit length, imposes a faster (higher frequency) process of
reading (sensing the magnetization orientation)/writing (changing the magnetization orientation) of the bit. While
the shortest time altering the magnetisation is required in reading/writing applications, the longest time is required
in (long-term) storage with protection of the data against large magnetic ﬁelds that might corrupt or even erase the
stored information.

In this work we examine the eﬀects of time dependent ﬁeld and ﬁnite temperature on a single domain Stoner
particle. The time it takes for the magnetization to change is also studied with temperature and material parameters.
Interesting quantum phenomena, beyond the scope of this paper, might occur at T
0K such as magnetic quantum
tunneling...

II. EQUATION OF MOTION FOR THE MAGNETIZATION IN THE PRESENCE OF A TIME
DEPENDENT FIELD

Magnetization dynamics is governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. Since magnetization M is akin to
angular momentum, we have an evolution equation for M similar to angular momentum, the Bloch equation of motion
dM /dt = γ0M

H with γ0 the gyromagnetic ratio and H the external ﬁeld (see for instance Kittel [1]).

Extending the Bloch equation to a moment M subjected to an ”eﬀective” ﬁeld He and a dissipation term describing
losses and relaxation processes in the material, Landau and Lifshitz (L-L) assumed that dissipation is accounted for
by a coeﬃcient λ and introduced a dissipation non-linear term of the form

modulus of M ) controlled by the eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld He:

The system of ODE eqs. 4 is integrable by standard explicit methods, such as Euler or Runge-Kutta (see for instance
ref. [2]) after expressing the components in Cartesian coordinates. The conservation of the norm is very useful during

with the deﬁnitions: m = M /Ms,
Using order-4 Runge-Kutta (RK4) method (see ref. [2]) with M along the z-axis as an initial condition, we apply
at t = 0 a time dependent ﬁeld making 135◦with the z-axis. The 3D response of the magnetization in time is depicted
in ﬁg. 1 and the z-component of m is depicted in ﬁg. 2. Undesirable ringing eﬀects (oscillations) in the time variation
of m are observed. They are so because they introduce an unwanted delay in magnetization reversal.

In order to eliminate the ringing eﬀect, we move on to another reversal mode called precession switching in which
the ﬁeld is applied perpendicularly to the initial magnetization and whose action is on until the magnetization is
reversed without displaying any ringing eﬀect. The reversal path on the unit sphere is called a ballistic path (see
ﬁg. 3) highlighting its optimality. The sensitivity of this process stems from the fact, the ﬁeld must be switched oﬀ
exactly at the time magnetization reverses (see ﬁg.4).

III. EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON MAGNETIZATION DYNAMICS

A grain at ﬁnite temperature is prone to thermal excitations that might alter its magnetization state. The simplest
model describing the eﬀect of temperature on a grain is inspired from Chemistry and is called the N´eel-Arrhenius
thermal excitation model. At very low temperature, switching may occur by tunneling at a given energy through the
energy barrier separating two magnetization states corresponding to two energy minima (see ﬁg. 5). This is known
as Macroscopic Quantum Tunneling of Magnetization that we will not describe here but for which there are excellent
reviews (see for instance ref. [9]).

At ﬁnite temperature, the empirical Arrhenius model is used to describe the kinetics of a thermally activated
process. This assumes that an energy barrier hinders the forward progress of a chemical reaction. The height of this
energy barrier is a measure of resistance to the reaction. Forward progress of the reaction requires the supply of an
activation energy to surmount this barrier. It has the form [3]:

τ = τ0 exp(∆E/kBT )

(5)

where τ is the chemical reaction ”inverse rate”, τ0 is the attempt time to traverse the barrier, ∆E is the barrier
height, kB is Boltzmann constant and T is absolute temperature.

Drawing an analogy from radioactivity, one might view switching as a decay process with a typical probability of
decay λ. Starting from an assembly of grains N0 at t = 0, the number of particles that decay in the instant [t, t + ∆t]
λN (t)dt. Integrating with the initial condition N0 = N (t = 0) we ﬁnd that the particles that are still
is dN =
λt).
present (did not decay or switch) is given by N (t) = N0 exp(

−

−

Since the average lifetime is given by τ = 1/λ we interpret the inverse rate as the average lifetime with respect to
switching. This means that the recorded information in a magnetic material (tape, disk, ﬂoppy etc...) stays unaltered
t/τ )
for a period of time given by τ . We infer from this analogy that the probability of switching is given by exp(
and therefore the probability of retaining the information (not switching) is given by the complementary probability:
P (t) = 1

t/τ ) with τ = τ0 exp(∆E/kBT ).

exp(

−

This decay picture of switching can be recast in a two-level model since switching means we have a transition from

−

−

a magnetization state (1) to another (2) as depicted in ﬁg. 5.

Considering a number (normalized) of non-interacting grains in state (1) as n1 and the number of grains in state

(2) as n2 we may write a kinetic equation (Master equation) with typical transition times τ1, τ2 as:

Assuming total number (normalized) conservation: n1 + n2 = 1, the solution of this equation is given by:

n1,2 =

t/τ )

(7)

τ1+τ2 is

τ1,2

the geometric average of τ1 and τ2.

As a result, we obtain a simple classiﬁcation of the possible magnetic states:

We have a blocked state when τ >> t i.e. n1 = n1,0 ∀
t.
We have a super-paramagnetic state in the opposite case τ << t leading to n1,2 = τ1,2

τ1+τ2 .

•

•

Physically, t is of the order of the experimental measurement time and a blocked state means that no change to
the system is observed during t. On the other hand, when the instrinsic time τ << t, the magnetization change is so
frequent that no well deﬁned state is maintained for a long enough time leading to the loss of hysteresis. Thus the
system behaves like a paramagnetic system that cannot store information (in a stable and reliable way). Hence the
origin of the ”super-paramagnetic” qualiﬁer.

When a grain switches we have information storage errors and the bit error rate (BER) is given by the switching

probability exp(

t/τ ).

−

In order to appreciate the meaning of BER and therefore average lifetime and barrier height, suppose we impose a
BER of 10−12. This means one bit is wrong in a 125 GBytes capacity hard disk. Identiﬁcation of BER and switching

A. Thermal average of the hysteresis loop

Thermal ﬂuctuations induce random orientations of a Stoner particle.

If the change of orientation is fast with
respect to our appreciation of the hysteresis loop, then we observe an overall mean behaviour stemming from an
average hysteresis loop. This average hysteresis loop can be calculated with several methods. In ensemble averaging,
one considers a single grain in many orientational conﬁgurations that is making diﬀerent angles with the magnetic ﬁeld
(taken along the z-direction). With time averaging, one considers a single grain undergoing diﬀerent magnetization
cycles while the magnetic ﬁeld is making diﬀerent angles with the grain axis. Under the Ergodic hypothesis these
averaging techniques should yield the same result. Adopting the ensemble average, we ought to ﬁnd for each angle φ
the minmum energy angle θ and every point on the hysteresis loop is made from the average over values of φ. We
perform the averaging in 3D following the original work of Stoner-Wohlfarth despite the fact previously our description
was made strictly in 2D.

Taking the anisotropy axis along the grain long axis with polar angle α and azimuthal angle φ (see ﬁg. 6) let p(α, φ)
denote the PDF (probability density function) of the angles α, φ be uniform over the domains [0, π] and [0, 2π]. Hence,
the average loop (being the projection of the magnetization over the direction of the ﬁeld is given by:

Since the individual PDF are independent, the joint PDF: p(α, φ) = pα(α)pφ(φ) is decoupled and since both PDF

R R

are ﬂat we get:

cos(θ + α) =

Z

The algorithm is now clear: Sweeping over α we ﬁnd the angle θ that minimises the energy in order to perform
the integral. In order to do minmize the number of these operations, we rather do the following. We transform the
minimum equation (as done in the ﬁrst part) in the form: sin(θ) cos(θ) + h sin(θ + α) = 0 through the replacement:
m = cos(θ + α) obtaining the equation:

B. Langevin dynamics for the L-L-G equations

At ﬁnite temperature, the deterministic L-L-G equation is replaced by the stochastic Langevin equation [4] governing
the evolution of M . The eﬀect of temperature is contained in random additional ﬁelds (thermal white noise) acting
on M :

where ∆ is the white noise intensity given by ∆ = λkBT /γµ.
Let (θ, φ) be the spherical angles of the orientation of the moment M . One may view (θ, φ) as a point on the
surface of the unit sphere. A statistical ensemble of moments with diﬀerent orientations can be represented by a
distribution of points over the unit sphere W (θ, φ, t) at time t. Conservation of probability leads to the continuity
equation (Fokker-Planck partial diﬀerential equation (PDE)):

In the case of arbitrary temperature, the behaviour of the transit time versus a (inverse temperature) for various

p

anisotropy ratios b is obtained numerically as depicted in ﬁg. 8.

One might be tempted to deﬁne the thermal switching time directly from the behaviour of the probability versus
time since the F-P equations provide a means to obtain that behaviour. Switching is reached when the probability
P (π/2, ts) = 0.5.

In ﬁg. 9, the time dependence of the probability P (π/2, t) is displayed versus for the anisotropy ratio b =

0.4 (see
ref. [13]) and shows a very quick variation above some threshold time if one starts initially from all zero values of the
probability.

−

The results are validated by comparison with the analytical case in ﬁg. 10. Even if the steepness of the numerical
results appear to be weaker than the anatytical results, the graph provides a strong support for the approximate
equivalence of both descriptions.

Analysis of the thermal switching time versus temperature has numerous technological consequences. Once again,
the F-P equation provides this kind of information paving the way to the search of the best materials/conditions that
yield the optimal switching time. We perform direct time integration of the F-P equations to extract the behaviour
0.4 as previously,
of the switching time versus temperature. As an illustration, using the same anisotropy ratio b =
the inverse switching time versus temperature is displayed in ﬁg. 11.

IV. EXTENSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES OF THE STONER-WOHLFARTH MODEL

The SW model is macrospin description of magnetic systems that is extremely rich from the static, statistical and
dynamic viewpoints. Despite is numerous limitations (and of the macrospin approach in general) described in the
ﬁrst part of this work, it remains a valid starting point for the useful description and basic understanding of many
(static and dynamic) problems of fundamental and applied magnetism.

The full 3D counterpart of the SW model as done in ref. [12] is an important extension. We point to the fact the

averaging of the hysteresis loop done in section 3 related to thermal eﬀects was already performed in 3D.

The extension to uniaxial anisotropies of arbitrary order (a higher anisotropy is of fourth or sixth order like in
Cobalt ...) or other forms like biaxial, planar, cubic (as in solid Ni or Fe) or of several competing types might provide
a richer behaviour of the loop versus angle.

The use of arbitrary non-ellipsoidal shape for the grain is also challenging given the occurrence of non-uniformity

of the magnetization.

Acknowledgement

The interaction between grains must also be studied and gauged with respect to its role in aﬀecting the switching
of the magnetization. Size reduction of the grains might lead to new types of interactions that generate novel types
of exchange that might be exploited in spintronic and quantum devices.

FIG. 9: Switching probability at θ = π/2 versus time at a ﬁxed temperature for an anisotropy ratio b = −0.4 (see ref. [13]).
The ten curves corresponding to ten diﬀerent inverse temperatures uniformly distributed over the interval a = [0 − 50] (see
ﬁg. 8) are indistinguishable. Switching time is reached when the probability is equal to 1/2.

We study an orbit of the electromagnetic two-body problem that involves a fast (stiﬀ) spinning
motion about a circular orbit. We give a multiscale method of solution that solves for the fast
timescale ﬁrst. The solvability condition of the asymptotic expansion demands resonances for the
fast dynamics. The stiﬀ resonant tori are found precisely in the atomic magnitude and agree
with many features of the Bohr atom in quantitative and qualitative detail; We calculate every ﬁrst
emission line of the ﬁrst 13 observable spectroscopic series of hydrogen within a few percent deviation.
The resonant orbits have angular momenta that are approximate multiples of Planck’s constant and
the emitted frequencies are given by a diﬀerence of two linear eigenvalues. This Lorentz-invariant
two-body dynamics exhibts the phenomenon of resonant dissipation, i.e., the metastable dynamics
radiates the center-of-mass energy while the particles perform fast spinning oscillations of small
amplitude about a circular orbit, a collective radiative recoil.

We study a two-body orbit of classical electrodynam-
ics involving a fast (stiﬀ) spinning toroidal motion about
a circular orbit. The nontrivial stiﬀ dynamics is part of
the full two-body motion with delay and it disappears
in the Coulombian limit. Our equations of motion are
prescribed by Dirac’s electrodynamics of point charges
with retarded-only ﬁelds [1], a fundamental physical the-
ory. The existence of the fast delay-dynamics demands
a multiscale asymptotic solution that solves for the fast
timescale ﬁrst. The multiscale method requires a res-
onance between two fast frequencies because of Freed-
holm’s alternative [2], providing the natural coupling be-
tween the fast and the slow timescales. The resonant
orbits turn out to be precisely in the atomic magnitude;
These resonant orbits are labelled by an integer and have
angular momenta that are multiples of a basic angular
momentum, that agrees well with Planck’s constant. The
emitted frequencies agree with the sharp lines of quantum
electrodynamics (QED) for the circular lines of hydrogen
with a few percent average deviation. The angular mo-
mentum of the stiﬀ spinning motion is of the order of the
orbital angular momentum, again in qualitative agree-
ment with QED.

Dirac’s 1938 work [1] on the electrodynamics of point
charges gave delay equations that were seldom studied.
Among the few dynamics investigated, an early result
of Eliezer [3, 4, 5] revealed a surprising result (hence-
forth called Eliezer’s theorem); An electron moving in
the Coulomb ﬁeld of an inﬁnitely massive proton can
never fall into the proton by radiating energy. The re-
sult was generalized to tridimensional motions with self-
interaction in a Coulomb ﬁeld [3, 4], ﬁnding that only
scattering states are possible. Since our model has the
dynamics of Eliezer’s theorem as the inﬁnite-mass limit,
a ﬁnite mass for the proton is essential for a physically
meaningful dynamics; If the proton has a ﬁnite mass,
there is no inertial frame where it rests at all times, and

this in turn causes delay because of the ﬁnite speed of
light. A ﬁnite mass for the proton is what brings de-
lay into the electromagnetic two-body dynamics, with
its associated fast dynamics. We shall describe the two-
body motion in terms of the familiar center-of-mass co-
ordinates and coordinates of relative separation, deﬁned
as the familiar coordinate-transformation that maps the
two-body Kepler problem onto the one-body problem
with a reduced mass plus a free-moving center of mass.
We stress that in the present relativistic motion the
Cartesian center-of-mass vector is not ignorable, and it
represents three extra coupled degrees-of-freedom. We
introduce the concept of resonant dissipation to general-
ize the concept of non-ionizing orbits of Ref.[6] . Reso-
nant dissipation is the condition that both particles decel-
erate together, i.e., the center-of-mass vector decelerates,
while the particles perform the almost-circular orbit il-
lustrated in Fig. 1, despite of the energy losses of the
metastable center-of-mass dynamics.

Here we use a circular orbit as the unperturbed solu-
tion of our perturbation scheme. This circular orbit is
a solution of the low-velocity Coulombian-limit obtained
by ignoring the delay and its associated fast dynamics.
The quantities for this uniform circular motion are given
now [7]; The electron has mass m1 and travels a circle
of radius r1 while the proton has mass m2 and travels
a circle of radius r2. We henceforth use units where the
electronic charge is e =
1 and the speed of light is
−
c = 1. The circular orbit is deﬁned by the retardation
angle θ that one particle turns while the light emanating
from the other particle reaches it (one light-cone distance
away). The angular momentum lz of the circular orbit
is given to ﬁrst order by l−1
z = θ, and for atomic orbits
θ is a small parameter of the order of the ﬁne structure
constant α = 1/137.036. For small values of θ the fre-
quency of angular rotation Ω and the particle distance
in light-cone rb are given, to the leading order in θ, by

locity of magnitude

where we scaled the oﬀending force by the magnitude
of the attractive force between the particles, a scaling
factor of 1/r2
b . Along the trajectory of the proton, the
delayed Li`enard-Wiechert attraction of the electron is the
main oﬀending force against the velocity, a force of ex-
actly the same magnitude of Eq. (2) as calculated with
the Page expansion of Ref.[8]. These oﬀending forces
cause dissipation along the unperturbed circular orbit.
This radiative instability in the slow timescale is an in-
complete picture of the dynamics though; it disregards
the fast stiﬀ motion that is present because of the delay
[7]. Precisely because of the stiﬀ delay dynamics, at very
small deviations from circularity the nonlinear terms of
the self-interaction force correct the leading term of Eq.
(2), enough to balance the oﬀending force of Eq. (2). In
the following we explain in physical terms how the stiﬀ
torus of Fig.1 is formed.

We start by substituting the circular orbit plus a per-
turbation into the equations of motion of [1]. For the
stability analysis we transform the Cartesian coordinates
of the particles to gyroscopic coordinates

of the self-interaction force of Eq. (2). The exact roots

where ǫ1(θ) and ǫ2(θ) are real and small numbers that
depend on the orbit through θ. The stiﬀ torus is formed
from an initial circular orbit as follows; (i) the oﬀending
force against the velocity makes the electron loose radius
by radiating energy on a slow timescale, and (ii) when the
electron deviates enough from the circular orbit, the stiﬀ
nonlinear terms compensate the oﬀending force of Eq.
(2) and balance the real parts of Eq. (8), the σ′s. The
motion continues to be stiﬀ because of the large imag-
′
inary part of the λ
In the following we
outline a multiscale expansion about the balanced stiﬀ
torus to derive a resonance condition between the modes
of tangent dynamics. The circular orbit recoils in a slow
timescale to compensate the momentum of the radiated
energy, such that the particle coordinates are described
by a composition of a translation mode and a stiﬀ mode
with a slowly varying amplitude

(9)

where the amplitudes uk and Rk must be near the size a
where the nonlinearity balances the negative real part of
the linear modes. Because of the large frequency of the
stiﬀ motion, this balancing is established at a very small
radius, as we estimate in the following.

The correction to Eq. (2) is provided by the nonlinear
terms of the Lorentz-Dirac force, as given in page 116
of Ref [10]. Keeping only terms along the velocity, this
correction to the self-interaction force along the velocity
is

u1 and R1 are deﬁned in Eq. (9). Equation (11) shows
that the extra stiﬀ nonlinear term balances the oﬀending
force at the electron along the stiﬀ torus at the small
amplitude

This distance is a small fraction of the orbital radius and
it represent a length of

where on the second line of Eq. (15) we have used for-
mula (1) for Ω and for rb. Notice that we chose the
same q in Eq. (9) to cancel the fast oscillation in Eq.
(15). As illustrated in Fig. 1, the fast spinning angular
momentum should rotate with the circular orbit at the
frequency Ω, such that its phase should be equal to Ωt.
This phase velocity condition imposed on Eq. (15) yields
the following resonance condition

The calculation of ǫa

equations of motion to quadratic order to include the
nonlinear stiﬀ terms (the linear stability of the stiﬀ
torus). A purely harmonic solution to these nonlinear
equations of tangent dynamics exists because the non-
linear stiﬀ terms introduce a correction proportional to
a/θ into Eqs.
(6) and (7), and the complete calcula-
tion will be given elsewhere. We expect nevertheless the
quasi-degeneracy to be preserved because the stiﬀ limit
depends basically on the time light takes to travel be-
tween the particles. Once the stiﬀ torus is very close to
the circular orbit, ǫa
2 should diﬀer from ǫ1 and ǫ2
by a correction which is essentially the same because of
the quasi-degeneracy property, plus a correction of order

s. The resonant orbits of
Ref. [7] were in the atomic scale and had the same qual-
itative QED-like dependence with the integer q, which
seems to be a generic feature of these stiﬀ electromagnetic
resonances of the two-body problem. The root-searching
problem of Eq. (19) is well posed and for each integer

maximal angular momenta and a radiative selection rule
( ∆l =
1) restricts the decay from level k + 1 to level k
only, i.e., circular orbits emit the ﬁrst line of each spec-
troscopic series (Lyman, Balmer, Ritz-Paschen, Brackett,
etc...), the third column of Table 1. We have solved Eq.
(19) and Eqs. (6) and (7) with a Newton method in the
complex λ-plane. Every angular momentum 1/θ deter-
mined by Eq. (19) has the correct atomic magnitude for
any q. The subset of resonant orbits listed in Table 1 has
orbital frequencies near a circular line of QED with a few
percent deviation.

The emission lines are in reasonable quantitative agree-

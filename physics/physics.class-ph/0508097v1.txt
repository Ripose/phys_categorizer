We report on a test of Lorentz invariance performed by comparing the resonance frequencies of
one stationary optical resonator and one continuously rotating on a precision air bearing turntable.
Special attention is paid to the control of rotation induced systematic eﬀects. Within the photon
sector of the Standard Model Extension, we obtain improved limits on combinations of 8 parameters
at a level of a few parts in 10−16. For the previously least well known parameter we ﬁnd ˜κZZ
e− =
(−1.9 ± 5.2) × 10−15. Within the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl test theory, our measurement restricts
2 to (−2.1 ± 1.9) × 10−10, corresponding to an eightfold
the isotropy violation parameter β − δ − 1
improvement with respect to previous non-rotating measurements.

Local Lorentz invariance (LLI) is an essential ingredi-
ent of both the standard model of particle physics and the
theory of general relativity. It states that locally physi-
cal laws are identical in all inertial reference frames i.e.
independent of velocity and orientation. However, sev-
eral attempts to formulate a unifying theory of quantum
gravity discuss tiny violations of LLI. Modern high preci-
sion test experiments for LLI are considered as important
contributions to these attempts, as they might either rule
out or possibly reveal the presence of such eﬀects at some
level of measurement precision. An experiment of partic-
ular sensitivity to LLI-violation is the Michelson-Morley
(MM) experiment [1] testing the isotropy of the speed of
light. Modern versions employ high ﬁnesse electromag-
netic resonators, whose eigenfrequencies depend on the
speed of light c in a geometry dependent way (ν ∼ c/L
for a linear optical Fabry-Perot cavity of length L). Thus
a measurement of the eigenfrequency of a resonator as its
orientation is varied, should reveal an anisotropy of c/L.
Recently, such an anisotropy of c has been described as
a consequence of broken Lorentz symmetry within a test
model called Standard Model Extension (SME) [2]. This
model adds all LLI violating terms that can be formed
from the known ﬁelds and Lorentz tensors to the La-
grangian of each sector of the standard model of parti-
cle physics. It thus allows a consistent and comparative
analysis of various experimental tests, including the MM
experiment. The latter however, is also often interpreted
according to a kinematical test theory, formulated by
Robertson [3] and Mansouri and Sexl [4] (RMS). This test
theory assumes a preferred frame, commonly adopted to
be the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Combina-
tions of three test parameters (α, β, δ) then model an
anisotropy as well as a boost dependence of c within a
frame moving at velocity v relative to the CMB.
In view of the substantial
impact that LLI-violation
would have all over physics, the new approach of the

SME has triggered a new generation of improved MM-
type experiments [5, 6, 7, 8]. So far all of these recent
measurements relied solely on Earth’s rotation for vary-
ing resonator orientation, which was made possible by the
low drift properties of cryogenically cooled resonators.
However, actively rotating the setup as done in a clas-
sic experiment by Brillet and Hall [9] oﬀers two strong
beneﬁts:
(i) the rotation rate can be matched to the
timescale of optimal resonator frequency stability and
(ii) the statistics can be signiﬁcantly improved by per-
forming thousands of rotations per day. While otherwise
using equipment similar to that in the non rotating ex-
periments, these advantages should allow for tests im-
proved by orders of magnitude – assuming that system-
atic eﬀects induced by the active rotation can be kept
suﬃciently low.

Here we present the ﬁrst implementation of such a con-
tinuously rotating optical MM-type experiment since [9].
Concurrent work of other groups, however, also features
similar experiments either using continuously rotating
microwave cavities [10] or cryogenic optical resonators,
whose orientation is periodically changed by 90◦ [11]. At
the core of the experimental setup is an optical cavity
fabricated from fused silica (L = 3 cm, 20 kHz linewidth)
which is continuously rotated on a precision air bearing
turntable.
Its frequency is compared to that of a sta-
tionary cavity oriented north-south (L = 10 cm, 10 kHz
linewidth). Each cavity is mounted inside a thermally
shielded vacuum chamber. The cavity resonance fre-
quencies are interrogated by two diode pumped Nd:YAG
lasers (1064 nm), coupled to the cavities through windows
in the vacuum chambers, and stabilized to cavity eigen-
frequencies using the Pound-Drever-Hall method [12].
The table rotation rate ωrot = 2π/T is set to T ∼ 43 s
(∼ 2000 rotations/day) matching the time scale of op-
timum cavity stability (∆ν/ν = 1 × 10−14). At this
rotation rate it is also possible to rely on the excellent

tilt sensor (TS).

thermal isolation properties of the vacuum chambers at
room temperature (time constant ∼ 10 h). The residual
temperature drift of the resonance frequencies is on the
order of 1 MHz/day, which is comparatively high but suf-
ﬁciently linear to be cleanly separated from a potential
LLI-violation signal at 2ωrot.
Fig.1 gives a schematic view of the rotating setup. Elec-
trical connections are made via an electric 15 contact slip
ring assembly on top. To measure the frequency diﬀer-
ence ∆ν of both lasers, a fraction of the rotating laser’s
light leaves the table aligned with the rotation axis (see
Fig.1) and is then overlapped with light from the station-
ary laser on a high speed photodetector. The resulting
beat note at the diﬀerence frequency ∆ν ∼2 GHz is read
out at a sampling rate of 1/s after down conversion to
about 100 MHz.

We expended substantial eﬀort on minimizing system-
atic eﬀects associated with turntable rotation (see Fig.2).
In addition to good thermal and electromagnetic shield-
ing, this most importantly involves limiting cavity de-
formations due to external forces (gravitational and cen-
trifugal).
If the cavity is not supported in a perfectly
symmetric manner, its frequency is particularly suscep-
tible to tilt. We observe a relative frequency change of
1.5 × 10−16/µrad. As tilts which vary as a function of the
orientation of the turntable enter the analysis of the ex-
periment, such changes have to be suppressed by keeping
the rotation axis as vertical as possible and preventing

wobble in the setup. The latter is achieved by employing
a turntable with intrinsic wobble < 1 µrad and carefully
balancing the center-of-mass of the rotating part. To pre-
vent long term variations of rotation axis tilt, an active
tilt control is applied. Similar to the scheme described by
J. Gundlach [14], we place the table on three aluminum
cylinders, 20 cm in length, two of which can be heated in-
dependently in order to use thermal expansion (5µm/◦C)
to compensate slow tilt variations. The heating is part
of a computer controlled closed servo loop, and the tilt is
monitored using an electronic bubble level sensor of 0.1
µrad resolution placed at the turntable center. Typical
tilt variations of the laboratory’s ground ﬂoor are several
10 µrad/day. Without tilt control these would give rise to
(varying) systematic eﬀects at 2ωrot of up to one part in
10−14. The active stabilization reduces tilt variations to
< 1µrad corresponding to systematic tilt induced eﬀects
< 10−16.

For our setup, the fundamental signal indicating an
anisotropy due to a LLI-violation is a sinusoidal varia-
tion of the beat frequency at 2ωrot. As described in [2]
the amplitude of this signal in turn is expected to be
modulated due to Earth’s rotation at ω⊕ (and at Earth’s
orbital motion Ω⊕, which will be considered below). This
can be expressed as

∆ν
ν0

= S(t) sin 2ωrott + C(t) cos 2ωrott,

(1)

where ν0 ∼ 2.82 × 1014 Hz is the undisturbed laser fre-
quency and the amplitudes S(t) and C(t) vary according
to

S(t) = S0 + Ss1 sin ω⊕t + Sc1 cos ω⊕t +

(2)

Ss2 sin 2ω⊕t + Sc2 cos 2ω⊕t,

C(t) = C0 + Cs1 sin ω⊕t + Cc1 cos ω⊕t +

Cs2 sin 2ω⊕t + Cc2 cos 2ω⊕t.

From each continuous measurement of ∆ν comprising
2000 to 10000 rotations, we determine the set of ten
Fourier coeﬃcients {Si, Ci} within Eq.(2) and Eq.(3) in a
similar way as in [11]. To minimize cross-contamination
between Fourier coeﬃcients we only consider data win-
dows that are integer multiples of 24 hours in length.
This method was carefully validated by analyzing test
data sets created by superimposing a hypothetical vio-
lation signal to our data, and checking that the known
Fourier coeﬃcients were reliably reproduced. The pro-
cedure is as follows: We divide the data into subsets
of 10 table rotations each (200 subsets/24 h) and use a
least squares ﬁt to Eq.(1) for each subset [13]. To ob-
tain a proper ﬁt in the presence of drift and small resid-
ual systematics at ωrot, we include additional sine and
cosine components at ωrot, an oﬀset, and a linear and
quadratic drift. At the chosen subset size this is suf-
ﬁcient to cleanly separate the frequency drift from the
signal at 2ωrot. Next, we ﬁt the resulting distributions
of S(t) and C(t) with Eq.(2) and Eq.(3) [13] yielding the
complete set {Si, Ci} and individual ﬁt errors for each
coeﬃcient.
Following this scheme we analyzed 15 data sets of 24 h
to 100 h in length, spanning December 2004 to April
2005 and comprising ∼ 70000 turntable rotations in to-
tal. Fig.3 shows the resulting Fourier coeﬃcients {Si, Ci}
as a function of time together with their weighted aver-
age values. Note that a small systematic eﬀect at 2ωrot is
still present aﬀecting the components C0 and S0 in par-
ticular. This has to be specially considered within the
interpretation of these results according to the two test
theories SME and RMS given below.

For the photonic sector of the SME the LLI violating
extension contains 19 independent parameters, which can
be arranged into one scalar κtr, and four traceless 3 × 3
matrices: ˜κe−, ˜κo+, ˜κe+ and ˜κo−. While κtr is related to
the one way speed of light [15], the elements of the latter
two matrices are restricted to values < 10−32 by astro-
physical observations [16]. The remaining matrices ˜κe−
and ˜κo+ contain 8 parameters that describe a boost de-
pendent (˜κo+, antisymmetric) and a boost independent
(˜κe−, symmetric) anisotropy of the speed of light. Re-
cent measurements have restricted 7 of these elements to
a level of 10−11 respectively 10−15 [5, 6, 7, 8]. ˜κZZ
e− can
only be determined in actively rotating experiments thus
it was not accessible in these experiments, as they relied
solely on Earth’s rotation.
The dependence of the determined Fourier coeﬃcients on
these SME parameters, referred to a Sun centered coordi-
nate system, can be calculated as outlined in [2]. To ﬁrst
order in orbital boosts we obtain the combinations given
in Tab.I. The amplitudes contain siderial phase factors,
that account for a modulation of the boost dependent
˜κo+ terms due to Earth’s orbit. For data sets spanning
> 1 year this allows the independent determination of
κo+ and κe− terms by ﬁtting these variations to the re-

FIG. 3: Each graph gives the distribution of a certain Fourier
coeﬃcient of Eq.(2) and Eq.(3) in time. Note the diﬀerent
scale for C0 and S0 aﬀected by small systematic eﬀects. The
time axis spans December 2004 to April 2005. 15 points are

spective distributions of coeﬃcients {Si, Ci}. However,
as our data currently only spans 4 months, we can only
extract limits on individual parameters if we additionally
assume no cancellation between the ˜κe− terms and ˜κo+
terms. Based on this assumption we obtain the values
given in Tab. II. These limits on the order of few parts
in 10−16 improve the ones obtained in [7] by up to a fac-
tor of eight. A future analysis including data covering a
longer time period will be able to remove the assumption
of non-cancellation.
The parameter ˜κZZ
e− needs a special consideration as it
only enters C0, and might thus be compromised by the
systematic eﬀects. However, we observe that the phase
of this residual systematic signal varies widely between
individual measurements. The systematic eﬀect thus av-
erages out resulting only in an increased error bar on the

mean value of this component. As the systematic eﬀects
are comparatively small, we can still improve the limit on
˜κZZ
e− set by [10]. From the average value of C0 we deduce
a limit for (˜κe−)ZZ of (−1.9 ± 5.2) × 10−15, taking into
account that the contributions to C0 from the ˜κo+-terms
are already restricted to < 10−15 by the other Fourier
components. While (˜κe−)ZZ plays no special role among
the components of the ˜κe−-matrix, setting such stringent
limits on it is especially important from an experimental
point of view, as it most directly indicates our ability to
control rotation related systematic eﬀects.
For comparison to earlier work we also give an analy-
sis within the RMS framework. This test theory mod-
els an anisotropy of the speed of light according to
∆c ∼ B v2
c2 sin2 θ, where B abbreviates the RMS test pa-
rameter combination (β − δ − 1
2 ). v is the laboratory
velocity relative to the CMB and ϑ is the angle between
direction of light propagation and v. B enters the {Si,Ci}
Fourier amplitudes as shown in Tab.I if we neglect mod-
ulation of v = 370 km/s due to orbital boosts. To deter-
mine B from our data we simultaneously ﬁt these func-
tions to the respective distributions of Fourier coeﬃcients
in Fig. 3, excluding C0 compromised by systematic ef-
fects. This results in B = (−2.1 ± 1.9) · 10−10, which is a
factor of eight improvement in accuracy compared to the
non rotating experiment of [5].

In conclusion, our setup applying precision tilt con-

trol proves that comparatively high rotation rate can
be achieved at low systematic disturbances. This lifts
a severe limitation from actively rotated MM-type ex-
periments as performed in the past [9], and provides the
possibility to increase sensitivity of these tests to LLI-
violation by orders of magnitude. At the current status
of our measurement we can already set limits on several
test theory parameters that are more stringent by up to
a factor of eight. An extended analysis of the experiment
within the SME shows that it is also sensitive to param-
eters from the electronic sector of the SME that change
the cavity length [17]. While this provides the possibility
to set limits on further SME parameters, we leave it for a
future analysis. The main limitation of accuracy within
our experimental setup currently arises from laser lock
stability. Thus, the implementation of an active vibra-
tion isolation as well as new cavities is underway, which
should enable us to improve laser lock stability by about
an order of magnitude.

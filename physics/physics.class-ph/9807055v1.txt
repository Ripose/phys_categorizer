Abstract

It is demonstrated that any two reference frames (RFs), which are uniformly
and rectilinearly moving relative to each other, can be adjusted via (possi-
bly anisotropic) rescaling and re-synchronization so that the resulting pair
of RFs is Lorentzian; this statement remains true if the word “Lorentzian”
is replaced by “Galilean” or “Riemannian”, i.e., if a ﬁnite positive value of
c2 is replaced by
or by a negative real number. In this particular sense,
the Lorentzian, as well as Galilean or Riemannian, phenomenon turns out to
be merely a matter of an arbitrary choice of appropriate rescaling and re-
synchronization of any given pair of RFs. Generalizations and reﬁnements
of this result are obtained, including universal generalized Lorentzian adjust-
ment via rescaling and re-synchronization of arbitrarily large families of RFs.
Alternatively, the generalized Lorentzian property of a pair of RFs is shown
to be a consequence of reciprocity and isotropy, with no adjustment needed
in this case. The universality of light and of the corresponding Lorentzian
property of the spacetime is questioned. Waves of transformation of space-
time are introduced, which have in a certain sense a more universal character
than electromagnetic or gravitational waves.

I. INTRODUCTION

This paper is peculiar in more aspects than one. Here are some indications as to what

¶
this paper is and does, and what it is not and does not.

This paper is an attempt at a careful critical reading of Einstein’s paper on the special
theory of relativity [4]. In particular, we rigorously examine the physical procedures re-
quired to establish an appropriate correspondence between space- and time-measuring
devices in two reference frames moving uniformly and rectilinearly relative to each
other; we refer to such physical procedures as adjustment of reference frames.

As such, this paper is most deﬁnitely not in the mainstream. To the best of my
knowledge, it bears little relation with any work which has followed Einstein’s [4].
Therefore, “reading” this paper by way of associations with existing literature will
most probably result in misunderstanding.

This paper is entirely self-contained, except for the purely mathematical references
[3,6,7].

In no way does this paper use the notion of the metric tensor or any terms based
on that notion. The consideration is local throughout the paper, except for Section
V, where a condition of diﬀerentiability in an entire region of spacetime is imposed.
Therefore, an attempt to interpret the results of this paper in metric-based terms will
most probably lead to misunderstanding.

Neither any properties of electromagnetic waves nor even their existence are used in
this paper.

Thus, in the usual sense, the theories presented here pertain neither to the “special”
theory of relativity (since we do not unilize the notion of light) nor to the “general”
one (since we do not unilize the notion of the metric).

No speciﬁc properties such as inertiality, group properties, properties of speciﬁc mea-
suring devices as rigid or elastic bodies are used.

No properties of spacetime such as isotropy and reciprocity are ﬁxed throughout this
paper. Rather, an entire spectrum of possible physical scenarios is considered, ranging
from scenarios with no assumptions whatsoever on isotropy or reciprocity to ones
where both isotropy and reciprocity are assumed to be fully present.

In each such scenario, it is shown that there exists an adjustment of the pair of reference
frames in question which makes the pair Lorentzian; the “amount” of the required
adjustment is the less the more isotropy or reciprocity is there.

The treatment is completely rigorous, which is convenient and almost unavoidable for
a careful logical examination and especially when dealing with the multitude of the
possible scenarios. Yet, the mathematics involved is most elementary, even though at
times tedious.

One should note that the notion of reference frames (RFs) and that of RF change
transformations (RFCTs) are deﬁned in this paper to allow the most general con-
4 real matrix is a matrix of some
sideration: namely, so that any non-singular 4
RFCT.

×

Since the ﬁrst days of the theory of relativity, the common belief has been that the Lorentzian
transformations can appear only as a consequence of special physical conditions, which the
RFs under consideration must satisfy, such as inertiality, constancy (in various senses) of the
speed of light, isotropy, reciprocity, the principle of relativity, properties of rigid or elastic
bodies, various group conditions, etc.

Quite contrary to this belief, we demonstrate in this paper that the Lorentzian trans-
formations can arise simply as the result of an appropriate (possibly anisotropic) rescaling
and re-synchronization of any given pair of mutually uniformly and rectilinearly moving
(URMoving) RFs.

This is the ﬁrst main result of this paper, Theorem 10, page 26, stated also in the
ﬁrst sentence of the above Abstract. The import of this statement depends foremost on
the deﬁnition of an RF and on that of an RF URMoving relative to another RF. At this
point, suﬃce it to say that our deﬁnitions will be such that any non-singular linear — or,
even more generally, aﬃne – transformation of R4 serves as the RF change transformation
(RFCT) for some pair of RFs, URMoving relative to each other. (An aﬃne transformation
is any composition of a linear transformation and a parallel translation.) Thus, our notion
of an RF URMoving relative to another RF is as wide as it can possibly be.

We call an RF ˜f an adjustment of another RF f if ˜f is at rest relative to f . It is easy to
see – refer to Proposition 2, page 18 – that any adjustment of an RF may be obtained as a
composition of the following four elementary types of adjustment: the (trivial) space-time
origin adjustment, temporal adjustment, spatial adjustment, and re-synchronization.

In the fundamental paper by Einstein [4] and in most texts, the special theory of relativity
is derived based on the principle of relativity and on the postulate of the constancy of the
speed of light.

Even at the ﬁrst attempt to examine these two cornerstones of the theory, it becomes
clear that their possible meaning crucially depends on the adjustment procedures employed
in order to put into correspondence spacetime measurements in the two given RFs, which
includes adjustment of the rates of the clocks, of the directions of the spatial axes, of the
units along them, and synchronization of the clocks as a function of the spatial position of
the clock. We shall refer to such procedures as (mutual) adjustment of (the pair of) RFs.

Most of the existing accounts of the theory of relativity do not emphasize the import
of the choice of adjustment procedures. However, the original paper by Einstein [4] treats
the matter of adjustment quite explicitly. In particular, beams of light are used for syn-
chronization of clocks; Einstein assumes, in addition to the principles of relativity and of
the constancy of the speed of light, that the relation “the clock at point A synchronizes
with the clock at point B” that he deﬁnes will be symmetric and transitive, i.e., it will be a

4

relation of equivalence. The spatial geometry in each of the two given RFs is assumed to be
Euclidian. Physically, this means the existence of rigid bodies with their usually assumed
properties.

The correspondence between the spatial units is established according to Einstein [4] by
transporting rods from one RF into another RF, URMoving relative to the ﬁrst one. With
such an approach, one could ask whether the logical foundations of the special theory of
relativity are not thus compromised, since the rods to be so transported must be accelerated
if the relative speed of the two RFs is nonzero.

To avoid this diﬃculty, some authors just require – tacitly or, less often, explicitly –
only the existence of a universal adjustment of all, say inertial, RFs such that the principles
of relativity and that of the constancy of the speed of light are satisﬁed. However, this
approach not only needs the additional, certainly not trivial, requirement of the existence
of a universal adjustment but also leaves open the question as to how such a universal
adjustment can be physically achieved.

To overcome all these diﬃculties, we engage into a comprehensive study of adjustment
of RFs in relation with the generalized Lorentzian property. Surprisingly, this appears to be
the ﬁrst systematic study of adjustment of RFs.

We introduce generalized Lorentzian – i.e., C-Lorentzian for some real C – pairs of RFs
and the corresponding RFCTs; we refer to an RFCT (and to a corresponding pair of RFs)
as C-Lorentzian if the RFCT preserves the C-metric

It is the sign of C that is of utmost importance. Let us refer to the C-metric as positive-
Lorentzian or simply Lorentzian if C > 0, 0-Lorentzian or Galilean if C = 0 (which corre-
sponds to c =
), and negative-
Lorentzian or Riemannian if C < 0.

An implication of Theorem 10, page 26, is that any given pair of mutually URMoving
RFs is Lorentzian up to adjustment. A signiﬁcant feature of Theorem 10 is that, however
wide or narrow deﬁnition of URMoving RFs is assumed, the word “Lorentzian” in the last
implication can be freely replaced by “Galilean” or “Riemannian”. This may seem highly
surprising, since the Lorentzian property, as contrasted to the Galilean or Riemannian one,
now looks merely as a matter of the choice of rescaling and re-synchronization of one and
the same pair of RFs, rather than a fundamental property of a physical spacetime.

Such a impression would be true only in part. In Sections II E and IV D, we show that
– if certain veriﬁable physical conditions of isotropy and reciprocity take place – the sign
of C can be described as a natural local property of the physical spacetime. We propose
critical experiments which could discriminate, again locally, between the three possible types
of spacetime geometry: Lorentzian, Galilean, or Riemannian. We shall refer to any of these
three types of spacetime geometry as generalized Lorentzian. We do not assume that the
entire spacetime is of any one of these three types.

Mathematically, Theorem 10 is very simple; it just means that any non-singular 4

4

real matrix A (i.e., the matrix of any RFCT) can be represented as

where B is a C-Lorentzian matrix and the matrix blocks S and S1 are 3

is the general form of the matrix of adjustment transformations.

Now a surprise possibly produced by the statement of Theorem 10 should all but dis-
appear. Indeed, the L.H.S. of (1) can be described by 4
4 = 16 real parameters (“de-
grees of freedom”), while the R.H.S. of (1) contains two times more, 32 parameters in all:
3) = 26 parameters of the two adjustment matrices plus 6 parameters of the C-
2(16
Lorentzian matrix B.

Moreover, not only does representation (1) exist, it is not unique. A reason for this, as
one can now see, is that a general adjustment matrix contains “too many”, 13, “degrees of
freedom”. One may therefore want to allow only certain special forms of adjustment, rather
than the general one. Alternatively or concurrently, one may also want to choose a standard
form of the C-Lorentzian matrix B.

That is just one way to look at results of Subsections III C through III I, where we have
certain uniqueness. In particular, in Subsection III H, one of the two adjustment matrices in
(1) is required to be the identity matrix while the C-Lorentzian matrix B is required to be a
C-boost; then the total on each side of (1) is (16
3) + 3 = 16 “degrees of freedom”, which
provides for a unique representation of any non-singular 4
4 real matrix as the product of
the matrix of an adjustment and that of a C-boost.

−

One may want just to put up with such a matrix language, without delving into such

questions as what an RF itself is; then one may skip some material of Section II.

In the general theory of relativity (TR), since all locally linear (i.e. diﬀerentiable) RFCTs
are allowed, the qualitative distinction between time and space, rather strong in the special
TR, seems to almost disappear. This almost complete elimination of the distinction between
time and space may seem hardly reconcilable with experimental practice, in which time-
measuring devices and processes are quite diﬀerent from space-measuring ones. Thus, a
reasonable question is, How could it be substantiated that all linear RFCTs should be
allowed, be it in a special or general TR?

Another result of this paper may serve to address this concern. This result is Theorem
12, page 26, which at the ﬁrst glance and by itself might seem even more surprising than
Theorem 10, since the latter is only an immediate corollary to the former.

Theorem 12 may be stated as follows: Let (f, g) be a pair of RFs which are mutually
URMoving with a nonzero velocity and let (f1, g1) be any other such pair; then RFs f and
g can be respectively adjusted to some RFs ˜f and ˜g so that the RFCT from ˜f to ˜g is the
same as the RFCT from f1 to g1.

In other words, any aﬃne RFCT with the corresponding nonzero relative velocity is
reducible by means of RF adjustment to any other such RFCT. In addition, it is easy to see
that this statement remains true if one replaces here the nonzero relative velocity requirement
by the requirement that for both RFCTs the corresponding relative velocity is zero; however,
because of unavoidable measurement errors, exactly-zero velocities are obviously exceptions,
which cannot possibly be experimentally detected. In this sense, practically all aﬃne RFCTs
can be obtained from practically any other aﬃne RFCT via RF adjustment. Thus, Theorem
12 provides a reason as to why all linear RFCTs should be allowed, and not only in the general

6

theory of relativity but in the special one as well. More exactly, however, what Theorem 12
says is that being relatively in motion or being relatively at rest is the only invariant of RF
adjustment. We see that some degree of distinction between time and space must remain so
that the relations of being relatively at rest or not at rest can be deﬁned.

Pauli [2], pg. 11, describing results by Ignatowsky, Frank and Rothe [1], wrote: “Nothing
can, naturally, be said about the sign, magnitude, and physical meaning of α”; Pauli’s α
corresponds to C in our notation. Contrary to Pauli’s opinion, in Section IV we describe
an experiment through which the sign and magnitude of C can be measured, even though
indirectly; the dimension of C is naturally that of [velocity]−2. Moreover, we provide a
physical interpretation of 1/C as the product of the velocities of certain time and space
waves – see (59), page 44.

The main distinction between time and space is that time is one-dimensional and space is
three-dimensional. For in the cases when only one spatial dimension is of interest, time and
space become exchangeable. This may be not very surprising in certain everyday situations
or, more generally, whenever there is a standard velocity. We say, e.g, ”the distance from
point A to point B is a ten-minute walk”.

Much deeper insights are provided by results of Section V which demonstrate, in particu-
lar, that there exists a complete in a certain sense duality between time and one-dimensional
space in terms of certain waves of transformation of the spacetime.

(Incidentally, in a number of derivations of the Lorentzian property, the spatial compo-
nent of the spacetime is assumed to be easily reducible to one dimension. But with one
spatial dimension, there is virtually no problem. Indeed, assuming just the reciprocity of
2 matrix A must satisfy the equation A = A−1; now a few lines of most
the RFCT, its 2
elementary algebra show that the RFCT is generalized Lorentzian.)

×

One may argue that the privileged role of the positive-Lorentzian geometry (with C > 0),
in contrast to the negative- or 0-Lorentzian ones, is related to the special role ascribed to
light, and this is true. In fact, a much stronger statement is true [3]: Suppose that, for a
given pair of RFs, there is some signal whose speed c is always the same in both of the RFs,
z1)2] = 0 in one of the RFs
i.e., the equality c2(t2
−
implies the same in the other RF; then the RFCT is a scalar multiple α
of a Lorentzian
transformation

, where α is a positive real.

Hence, if a slight reciprocity requirement is also satisﬁed (in order for the factor α in α

L
to be necessarily equal to
1), then the RFCT is simply Lorentzian. Such an additional
reciprocity requirement can be considered as an extremely non-restrictive form of the prin-
ciple of relativity. Thus, the principle of the constancy of the speed of light is so strong that
almost by itself, just with an addition of a very weak trace of the principle of relativity, it
implies the Lorentzian property; here one even does not need to assume that the two given
RFs are mutually URMoving – the latter is already implied by the only assumption of the
constancy of the speed of the signal!

Such extreme restrictiveness of the requirement of the constancy of the speed of light is
obviously related with its being too counterintuitive as perceived by many researchers since
the ﬁrst days of the relativity theory. Some of them have also thought that to give the
electrodynamic notion of light any special role in a theory of kinematics means to reverse
the natural order of ideas. For how can one possibly deﬁne a theoretical concept of electro-
magnetic waves before such kinematic notions as the coordinates of events in time and space

L

7

and relations between them have been developed?

At this point, one may further argue that the special role of light does not necessarily
imply putting electrodynamics before kinematics but is merely justiﬁed by the agreement
between the Lorentzian kinematics and the equations of electrodynamics.

The latter objection would be theoretically justiﬁed if the conventional form of the equa-
tions of electrodynamics were the only one theoretically possible or at least logically prefer-
able. However, it requires no eﬀort to give a simple (and just as inherently consistent as the
conventional form) extension of the equations of electrodynamics, comprising the negative-
Lorentzian and 0-Lorentzian spacetimes (in addition to the positive-Lorentzian ones). As
could be expected, the so extended equations do not admit electromagnetic waves at all in
negative-Lorentzian and 0-Lorentzian spacetimes; we also brieﬂy describe here the corre-
sponding hypothetical mechanics of not charged particles as well.

which are the conventional hyperbolic (wave) equations if C > 0 but elliptic ones if C < 0.
Thus, electromagnetic waves cannot exist in the negative-Lorentzian domains, where

C < 0.

Similarly, the conventional formula for the electromagnetic force is generalized as

and so, the components of F always take on real values, no matter what is the sign of C.

thus, the mass m decreases as v increases if C < 0, whereas the energy E always increases
as v increases, whether C is positive or negative.

Electromagnetic waves, as well as the conventionally described gravitational ones, can
exist only in positive-Lorentzian domains. In Section V, we describe certain transformation
waves that can exist in domains of any of the three types of spacetime geometry. We see this
as another argument against the necessity of the positive-Lorentzian geometry and against
that of the universal existence and character of light throughout the entire universe.

Yet one more potential objection can be seen here – that so far all experiments have been
in agreement with the positive-Lorentzian structure of spacetime. By itself, this statement
can hardly be doubted; furthermore, we believe that if the aforementioned critical experiment
proposed in Section IV of this paper, were conducted in a vicinity of the Earth, it only would
once again positively conﬁrm the positive-Lorentzian property.

8

However, what any experiment or at least any experiment dealing with signals with
bounded velocities can really test is a property of only a bounded spacetime domain in
which we happened to be situated, rather than that of the entire universe. The latter may
nevertheless have negative-Lorentzian domains as well, even if very remote from us, plus
three-dimensional 0-Lorentzian hypersurfaces between the positive-Lorentzian and negative-
Lorentzian domains. At least, no substantial logic is seen which would exclude the possibility
of such an intermittent structure of the universe at large.

Actually, if there are any purely theoretical reasons to discriminate between the three
types of spacetime, some general preference should be given to the negative-Lorentzian and
not to the positive-Lorentzian type. Indeed, in this paper we also describe certain universal
adjustments of however large families of mutually URMoving RFs. We show that any family
of mutually URMoving RFs possesses a universal negative-Lorentzian adjustment. However,
to possess a universal positive-Lorentzian or 0-Lorentzian adjustment, a family of RFs must
satisfy certain restrictions – see Theorem 16, page 28. In this sense, the negative-Lorentzian
adjustment is more universal than the positive-Lorentzian and 0-Lorentzian ones.

An intriguing question is, If there are negative-Lorentzian domains in the universe, how
could they be experimentally detected? At this point, we are far from being able to fully
describe the nature of signals that may originate in negative-Lorentzian domains and to say
in what manner can such signals get transformed upon entering our, doubtlessly positive-
Lorentzian, part of the universe. Note that in negative-Lorentzian domains there may exist
signals of any ﬁnite or inﬁnite speed; if such inﬁnite-speed or too-high-speed signals can
penetrate into Lorentzian domains at all, they must at least appropriately decrease their
speed upon such penetration.

What we can also say with certainty is that those hypothetical signals cannot origi-
nally exist in the negative-Lorentzian domains as either electromagnetic or conventionally
described gravitational waves. It might therefore seem to be not a very good idea to try to
detect negative-Lorentzian domains via electromagnetic or gravitational waves. Instead, it
makes sense to try to detect waves of transformation of spacetime, described in Section V,
using methods of Section IV.

In this paper, almost no assumptions are made in general; instead, a number of possible
scenarios are proposed; these scenarios depend on the number and nature of assumptions.
If anything is being assumed, it is explicitly stated. To make such an approach eﬀective, it
is important to verify every time that the assumptions made are necessary or essential, and
we adhere to this maxim.

By the already mentioned Theorem 10, page 26, any pair of mutually URMoving
RFs can be adjusted to a C-Lorentzian pair via (possibly anisotropic) rescaling and re-
synchronization.

On the other side of this spectrum of results is Theorem 27, page 33, which says that
certain reciprocity and isotropy properties of a pair of mutually URMoving RFs imply that
the given pair of RFs is already generalized Lorentzian. Moreover, by Theorem 28, the
generalized Lorentzian pairs can be fully characterized by reciprocity and isotropy.

It should therefore be clear that generally, the more is the extent to which reciprocity
and isotropy conditions are satisﬁed by a given pair of mutually URMoving RFs, the less
adjustment is needed in order to adjust such a pair to a generalized Lorentzian one.

9

We consider three main levels of assumptions regarding a given pair of mutually

URMoving RFs and identify the three corresponding levels of adjustment needed in order
to reduce the given pair of RFs to a generalized Lorentzian pair:

0. no assumptions at all – then both (possibly anisotropic) rescaling and re-synchronization

may be needed; see Theorem 10;

1. only reciprocity or isotropy is assumed – then, respectively, only (possibly anisotropic)
rescaling or isotropic rescaling with re-synchronization may be needed; see Theorem
19, page 30, and Theorem 24, page 32;

2. both reciprocity and isotropy are assumed – then no adjustment is needed, the pair of

RFs is then already generalized Lorentzian; see Theorem 27, page 33.

This is a physical paper of a rather infrequently encountered style. We try to make
explicit the distinction between the two modes of consideration: (i) when we are discussing
relations between the reality and the model and (ii) when we are acting within a rigorous
mathematical model. Thus, we ﬁrst build various models – see Section II; then we work
within the model under consideration by means of purely mathematical methods, without
using nearly impossible to rigorously deﬁne – at least before kinematics is developed – notions
such as clocks, rods, light, inertiality, etc. – see Sections III and V and the Appendixes;
ﬁnally, we go back to reality to consider methods of testing of the results and to interpret
the predictions of the theory – see Section IV.

The theorems in this paper can each be considered as a mini-theory of relativity; the as-
sumptions of a theorem correspond to a possible real-world scenario; each of the assumptions
corresponds to a postulate, i.e., to a statement about properties of physical objects.

We ﬁnd this style to be especially appropriate for the subject of this paper; it helps to
organize the multitude of diﬀerent scenarios, to clearly distinguish and, on the other hand,
to show the correspondence between physical objects and relations and their counterparts in
the model(s) used. This approach is also eﬀective in that it provides maximum generality,
since one and the same model notion may, and often does, admit many diﬀerent physical
realizations.

In particular, we need not restrict ourselves to inertial RFs, i.e. ones usually considered
as “freely falling” far away from large masses, where the divergence of the gravitational ﬁeld
is negligible.
Instead, for the most part of this paper, we theoretically consider pairs of
RFs which are only assumed to be URMoving relative each other, neither of them having to
be inertial or otherwise distinguished by itself; obviously, this is in perfect correspondence
with the spirit of the theory of relativity. On the other hand, pairs of inertial RFs can be
considered as special, even if most common, physical realizations of the notion of pairs of
mutually URMoving RFs.

This paper is devoted foremost to establishing as much order and clarity as possible
in kinematic foundations of physics. For is any unifying, thoroughly penetrating physical
theory possible other than one which is based on a ﬁrm and free of contradiction or vicious
circles kinematic foundation?

One may argue that as soon as the Lorentzian transformations are derived and as long
as the corresponding predictions are all well conﬁrmed by all experiments, there is no need
to question the basis on which the theory is built. It is however always an advantage to have

10

a theory, based on less contradictory and more general logical foundations, which would be
more ﬂexible and more easily adaptable whenever new experimental data appear.

The most basic notion in all the models introduced in this paper is that of the RF. An
RF is understood, in accordance with Einstein [5], as any 1-to-1 correspondence between the
space of all events and the space of all four-tuples of their temporal and spatial coordinates;
the latter space may be either R4 or a subset of R4. The other notions are all built on the
notion of the RF using logic, which parallels the corresponding relations between physical
objects.

This correspondence between physical objects and relations and their model counterparts
is indicated by using, after necessary discussion, the same term both for the physical object
and the respective model notion. The confusion between the two will hardly be possible
because of the context; in particular, Section III is explicitly devoted to the statement and
discussion of theoretical results within diﬀerent rigorous models, while in Section II all the
basic notions to be subsequently used are introduced and discussed.

Let us emphasize that we need not rigorously deﬁne notions like those of observers, clocks,
rods, inertiality, light; none of them is among our basic notions. Therefore, our theoretical
results do not depend on the concrete physical realizations of these notions. Of course, these
physical notions are important, but we refer to them only at the initial stage of building of
the models and at the concluding stages of testing of the models and of interpreting of the
results.

II. BASIC NOTIONS: REALITY–MODEL CONNECTION

A. Events, reference frames (RFs), RF change transformations (RFCTs), and
relabeling of events

Essentially, our notion of an RF coincides with the one proposed by Einstein [5] in his
general theory: “We allot to the universe four space-time variables x1, x2, x3, x4 in such a
way that for every point-event there is a corresponding system of values of the variables
x1, x2, x3, x4. To two coincident point-events there corresponds one system of values of
the variables x1, x2, x3, x4 ...”. Thus, two events with same space-time coordinates in an
appropriate RF are considered to be the same.

We use the term events, rather than “point-events”, and denote events by e, e0, e1, . . . .
. Let us stress that in this

paper the nature of events is irrelevant; no structure on the event space
is that it can be put into a 1-to-1 correspondence with R4.
only assumption made about
E
Any such correspondence is referred to as an RF. More exactly, let us deﬁne an RF as an
onto R4. This deﬁnition will be used throughout this paper,
arbitrary 1-to-1 mapping of
except only for Section V; see further details there.

It is the relative motion of given RFs as represented by the RFCT only, rather the nature

Let M be any motion, that is, any subset of the event space

two diﬀerent events e1 and e2, belonging to motion M, let us deﬁne the (average) velocity
of motion M relative to RF f between the two events as

Thus, the scope of this paper is not restricted to ﬁnite velocities only. Physically, though,
this particular point does not represent a signiﬁcant advantage, since, obviously, inﬁnite
velocities cannot possibly be experimentally detected, as well as any ﬁnite velocity cannot
be measured precisely. However, it is certainly more convenient not to restrict modeling
by the exclusion of inﬁnite velocities; one reason for this is that the velocity vM,f (e1, e2)
between two diﬀerent events can always be made inﬁnite simply by using re-synchronization
(refer to Subsection II D, page 16) in order to make events e1 and e2 synchronous relative
to RF f , so that tf (e2) = tf (e1).

A URMotion relative to an RF f is then deﬁned as any motion U, containing at least two
diﬀerent events and such that the average relative velocity vU,f (e1, e2) between two diﬀerent
events e1 and e2 belonging to U does not depend on the choice of such events e1 and e2.

Let us denote the constant velocity of a URMotion U relative to RF f simply by vU,f ,

so that vU,f = vU,f (e1, e2) for any choice of two diﬀerent events e1 and e2 belonging to U.

In other words, a subset U of the event space

is a URMotion relative to an RF f if
and only if the image f (U) (“world-line”) of U under mapping f lies on a (straight) line in
R4.

E

Thus, the so-deﬁned model notion of the URMotion corresponds to the uniform and
rectilinear motion of a negligibly small physical particle. The “world-line” of such a particle
does not have to be an entire (straight) line. As follows from the Fundamental Fact cited
below in Subsection II C, the use of such a more general notion does not diminish the strength
of the subsequent results; on the other hand, such a model notion better corresponds to
physical reality, since in practice only ﬁnitely many events can be observed, and so, the
corresponding points in R4 can never ﬁll a continuous line.

C. Mutually uniformly and rectilinearly moving (URMoving) RFs, their relative
velocities, and linearity of RFCTs

We have modeled the uniform and rectilinear motion of a negligibly small physical par-
ticle. A physical RF is thought of as consisting of a (usually very large) number of specially
arranged small particles and hence cannot be considered to be same as just any one small

13

6

physical particle. Therefore, another round of modeling is needed to introduce model notions
of mutually URMoving RFs and their relative velocities.

A

Let us say that an RF g is URMoving relative to another RF f if every URMotion U
relative to g is a URMotion relative to f , too. Geometrically, this simply means that the
RFCT

g,f = f ◦ (g)−1 maps every line in R4 into a line.

The Fundamental Fact in any special TR is that if an RF g is URMoving relative to
g,f is aﬃne; this fact is just a restatement of the fundamental
another f , then the RFCT
theorem of aﬃne geometry [6]. In particular, this fact implies that if RF g is URMoving
relative to RF f , then f is URMoving relative to g; hence, one can refer to a pair (f, g) of
mutually URMoving RFs.

A

Obviously, one could equivalently deﬁne URMoving RFs as follows. Let us call a motion
M accelerated relative to RF f if there are three distinct events e1, e2, and e3, belonging to
M and such that vM,f (e2, e3)

= vM,f (e1, e2).

Then an RF g is URMoving relative to another RF f if and only if every motion which

is accelerated relative to f is accelerated relative to g as well.

This statement may be considered as a weak form of the principle of relativity.
To test directly by the above deﬁnition whether two given RFs are mutually URMoving,
one would have to examine whether “every URMotion U relative to g is a URMotion relative
to f ”. It is therefore of importance for testing purposes that the latter requirement can be
relaxed to the following [7]: “every URMotion U relative to g with a small enough relative
is a URMotion relative to f ”, i.e.: “there exists a real number δ := δg,f > 0
speed
vU,g
< δ is a URMotion relative to f ”.
such that every URMotion U relative to g with
< δ by
The latter condition may be even further relaxed by replacing the inequality
R3, thus only requiring that every URMotion U relative
vU,g
|
to g with a relative velocity vU,g close enough to some given vector v0 be a URMotion
relative to f .

If an RF g is URMoving relative to another f , then, by the Fundamental Fact, the RFCT

g,f is aﬃne and its action on the vectors X in R4 is therefore given by

A

Obviously, equation (2) can be rewritten as

∈ E

The shift sg,f does not cause any essential diﬃculties, and so, will be assumed for simplicity
to be zero, unless otherwise indicated, so that all for any mutually URMoving pair of RFs
g,f will be assumed to be not just aﬃne but linear. Dropping also, for brevity,
(f, g), RFCT
the argument e in eq. (3), one may rewrite it simply as

A

(2)

(3)

Any terms originally deﬁned either for a pair (f, g) of mutually URMoving RFs or for
g,f or for the matrix Ag,f will apply interchangeably to all of these three
the aﬃne RFCT
notions. E.g., in Section III A, page 23, we shall rigorously deﬁne C-Lorentzian matrices;

A

f = Ag,f g.

then, a pair (f, g) of mutually URMoving RFs or the RFCT
and only if the matrix Ag,f is C-Lorentzian.

A

g,f will be C-Lorentzian if

If every pair of a family of RFs possesses a certain property, then we shall refer to the
family as possessing this property as well; e.g., a natural family of RFs is a family of RFs
in which every pair is natural.

Next, if an RF g is URMoving relative to another RF f , deﬁne the velocity of g relative
to f as vg,f := vU,f , where U is any URMotion relative to g with vU,g = 0; it is not hard to
see that this deﬁnition is correct in the sense that vU,f does not depend on the choice of U
given vU,g = 0.

Physically, the latter deﬁnition corresponds to the following. One ﬁxes any small particle
which is at rest relative to RF g; such a particle represents a URMotion relative to g with
the zero relative velocity, as though the particle was “attached to” RF g. Since RF g is
URMoving relative to RF f , the particle represents a URMotion relative to f as well. Then,
the constant velocity of this particle relative to f will be the relative velocity of g relative
to f ; this velocity does not depend on the choice of a particle at rest relative to g.

= tf (e1).

The above deﬁnition of the relative velocity may be restated as follows. Let e1 and e2
be any two events whose spatial coordinates in RF g are the same, i.e., rg(e2) = rg(e1);
tf (e1)) provided that
then the velocity of g relative to f is vg,f = (rf (e2)
If for any two events e1 and e2, rg(e2) = rg(e1) implies tf (e2) = tf (e1),
tf (e2)
then the relative velocity vg,f is inﬁnite.
It can be seen that all the vectors of the form
rf (e2)
rf (e1) for all pairs of events e1 and e2 satisfying the equality rg(e1) = rg(e2) are
directed along one line in R3; that line is the line of the direction of the vector of the relative
velocity vg,f , be it ﬁnite or inﬁnite.

Any RF ℓ∗, deﬁned on an event space

stationary relative to “remote stars”. Then the re-labeled version f ℓ∗ of any RF f coincides
with the RFCT

ℓ∗,f from the “stationary” RF ℓ∗ to RF f , f ℓ∗ =

ℓ∗,f .

Next, an RF f may be called inertial if it is URMoving relative to the “stationary” RF

ℓ∗. i.e., if the re-labeled version f ℓ∗ of RF f is an aﬃne mapping of

ℓ∗ = R4 onto itself.

A

Then any RF g1 which is not inertial is moving with (possibly non-uniform) acceleration
relative to the “stationary” RF ℓ∗. Let us deﬁne another RF f1 by the formula f1(e) = Ag1(e)
for all events e in
4 real matrix. Then RF f1, as well as

g1, is not inertial; it is accelerated relative to the “stationary” RF ℓ∗.

Nonetheless, RFs f1 and g1 are URMoving relative to each other, and so, pair (f1, g1)
belongs in the subsequent special theories of relativity given in this paper, even though RFs
f1 and g1 are not inertial.

Replacing the special and hard to rigorously deﬁne notion of the inertial RFs by the
more general notion of relatively URMoving RFs is in better conformance with the spirit of
relativity.

D. Notion and types of adjustment of reference frames

Given a physical RF, constructed using e.g. rods and clocks in the well-known manner,
one can adjust it by changing the directions of the three coordinate rods or the spatial
units along them. One can also adjust the RF by changing the rates of the clocks or the
directions of their hands’ movement. Finally, one can shift the readings of the clocks, possibly
depending on their spatial locations; this latter kind of adjustment may be referred to as
re-synchronization. Using any of these kinds of adjustment of the given RF, one obtains
another RF; it is physically evident that the latter RF is at rest relative to the former one.
This motivates the following model notion of adjustment of RFs.

Let us say that an RF ˜f is an adjustment of another RF f – or, equivalently, that RF ˜f
˜f ,f relative to RF f .

is at rest relative to RF f – if RF ˜f is URMoving with a zero velocity v

In this case, let us also say that the RFCT

It is easy to see that the adjustment transformations, as well as their matrices of form

(6), constitute a group. This fact will not however play a signiﬁcant role in this paper.

a re-synchronization corresponds to a shift of the readings of all the clocks in the
given RF without changing their rates and without changing the spatial coordinates
of events; of course, the readings of the clocks must be shifted in such a way that
all URMotions relative to the RF before re-synchronization remain so thereafter, so
that the transformation of the spacetime coordinates is aﬃne; it is also required that
this transformation preserve the spacetime origin, so that the transformation is in fact
linear.

It is evident from the above discussion that each of the listed model types of adjustment
is physically realizable. The following simple proposition shows that the above listing of the
types of adjustment is essentially complete, and so, the above-deﬁned notion of adjustment
is neither too general nor too narrow.

2.

Proposition: Adjustment structure

Any adjustment transformation can be represented as a composition of the listed above four

elementary types of adjustment, in any order.

Of the listed types of adjustment, re-synchronization and anisotropic spatial rescaling
seem to be the least desirable. In Subsections III D, III E, and III F we shall see when it is
possible to do without re-synchronization and when it is possible to use isotropic rescaling
rather than the anisotropic version.

Let us deﬁne an adjustment without re-synchronization as any adjustment which can be
represented as a composition of the three elementary types of adjustment listed above other
than re-synchronization. The matrix of an adjustment without re-synchronization is one of
the form diag(τ, S), where τ is a nonzero real and S is non-singular.

Let us deﬁne a re-orientation as any composition of a temporal re-orientation and a
spatial re-orientation, that is, any composition of adjustment transformations of subtypes
2(a) and 3(a), listed above. The matrix of a re-orientation is one of the form diag(ε, Q),
where ε =

1 and Q is an orthogonal matrix.

Let us deﬁne a rescaling as any composition of a temporal rescaling and a spatial rescal-
ing, that is, any composition of adjustment transformations of subtypes 2(b) and 3(b).
The matrix of a rescaling is one of the form diag(τ, S), where τ is a positive real and S
is symmetric and positive-deﬁnite. In other words, the matrix of any rescaling in an ap-
in R4 has the form

Note that any adjustment of any RF g does not change its velocity vg,f relative to any
other RF f , which is URMoving relative to g. This can be seen as another conﬁrmation of
consistency of the above modeling of adjustment of RFs.

Remark: C-Lorentzian adjustment without re-synchronization means the same as

C-Lorentzian rescaling
(For a rigorous deﬁnition of a generalized Lorentzian pair refer to Section III A below.) A
pair of RFs can be rescaled to a generalized Lorentzian pair if and only if it can adjusted
without re-synchronization to a generalized Lorentzian pair.

Indeed, any spatial re-orientation obviously preserves C-Lorentzian pairs of RFs. On the
other hand, any spatial adjustment can be represented as the composition of an anisotropic
spatial rescaling and a spatial re-orientation, in either order, according to the polar decom-

position of matrices. Hence, the statement of this remark follows.

E. Reciprocal, isotropic, and natural pairs of RFs

In this subsection, some rigorous model expressions for the principle of relativity will be

given.

Imagine two physical RFs located in the spacetime so that they can be considered com-
pletely symmetric to each other with respect to some center of symmetry. E.g., such a
situation can be the case if the following conditions are fulﬁlled.

(I) All the masses of the universe and their velocities are symmetric with respect to
some point, which is thus the center of symmetry of the universe; an approximation to this
ideal situation would be absence of large masses in a suﬃciently large neighborhood of a
comparatively small spacetime domain where the two RFs are located. (II) The two RFs
in question can be obtained only by means of physical processes which are symmetric with
respect to the center of symmetry.

Then, obviously, the central symmetry will coincide with the RFCT from one of the two

RFs to the other.

Clearly, instead of the central symmetry one consider here any (not necessarily orthog-
onal) symmetry with respect to any straight line or any two- or three-dimensional plane in
the spacetime. Here, the spacetime is considered locally, so that it can be assumed to be
approximately ﬂat.

Instead of any of the described above kinds of symmetry of the coordinate space R4,
one can consider any re-labeling ℓ:
of events, which is involutive in the sense that
ℓ ◦ ℓ = idE; in other words, if an event ˜e is the re-labeled version of another event e under
re-labeling ℓ, i.e., ˜e = ℓ(e), then event e is the re-labeled version of event ˜e under the same
re-labeling mapping ℓ, i.e., e = ℓ(˜e); for the deﬁnition of re-labeling of events, refer to
Subsection II A.

E → E

One thus comes to the following deﬁnition.
Let us call a pair (f, g) of mutually URMoving RFs reciprocal if
According to Proposition 1, a pair (f, g) of mutually URMoving RFs is reciprocal if and
only if the pairs (f, g) and (g, f ) are the same up to a (necessarily involutive) re-labeling of
events: f ℓ = g and g ℓ = f , where the re-labeling is ℓ = g−1 ◦ f = f −1 ◦ g.

g,f =

f,g.

A

A

Note that a pair (f, g) of mutually URMoving RF is reciprocal if and only if the RFCT
matrix A = Ag,f is involutive, i.e., A2 = I4 or, equivalently, A−1 = A. (Remember that the
shift sg,f in (3), page 14, is assumed to be zero throughout the paper.)

Hence, considering the Jordan canonical form of matrix A, it is easy to see that in
some basis in R4, the matrix of RFCT
g,f for a reciprocal pair (f, g) must be of the form
g,f
diag(ε0, ε1, ε2, ε3), where ε0, ε1, ε2, ε3 =
1. Thus indeed, the involutive transformation
is any (not necessarily orthogonal) symmetry in R4 with respect to any linear subspace of
R4.

A

Another important property a physical spacetime may have is isotropy. Let us assume
for a moment that this is the case. Yet, from a viewpoint of at least one of any two physical
RFs, URMoving relative each other with a nonzero velocity v, the inherent isotropy of the
spacetime will necessarily appear violated because of the deﬁnite direction of the relative
velocity v. However, if both of two appropriately constructed physical RFs are rotated
around the vector of the relative velocity v through one and the same angle, then one may
expect that the pair of the RFs will remain essentially the same as before the rotation in
the sense that the RFCT will not change.

One thus comes to the following deﬁnition.
We shall say that two mutually URMoving RFs f and g are mutually isotropically ori-
3 rotation matrix Q
g,f , where ˜f := diag(1, Q)f and

ented or, for brevity, that the pair (f, g) is isotropic if for any 3
such that Qvg,f = vg,f , the RFCT
˜g := diag(1, Q)g.

˜g, ˜f coincides with

A

A

×

In other words, a pair of RFs (f, g) is isotropic if the RFCT from g to f does not change
when both RFs undergo adjustment of the spatial axes via one and the same rotation of R3
preserving the vector of the relative velocity vg,f .

By Proposition 1, page 12, this can be also expressed as follows: a pair of RFs (f, g) is
isotropic if the pair of RFs ( ˜f , ˜g) obtained from (f, g) via one and the same rotation of their
spatial axes so that to preserve the vector of the relative velocity vg,f is the same as the
original pair (f, g) up to re-labeling of events.

The notion of isotropy remains meaningful even when the relative speed

is inﬁnite;
in such a case, once again, the rotations verifying the isotropy are around the well-deﬁned
line of the direction of vg,f .

✷

The equivalence of Conditions 1 and 2 of Proposition 4 means that in the deﬁnition of
the isotropic pair, instead of the invariance of the RFCT with respect to all rotations about
v, it suﬃces to require the invariance of the RFCT with respect to only one rotation through
not a multiple of 180◦; in particular, the angle of the rotation can be chosen to be arbitrarily
small.

Proposition 4 will be proved in Appendix 9, page 55.
Let us say that a pair of mutually URMoving RFs (f, g) is natural if it can be adjusted

via re-orientation and isotropic rescaling to a reciprocal and isotropic pair of RFs.

We suggest that the model notion of the natural pair of RFs generalizes the idea of
the pair of specially constructed inertial RFs. By an inertial RF we understand a physical
RF, “freely falling without rotation” and located in a small enough region of the physical
spacetime, where the divergence of the gravitational ﬁeld is negligible.

The above-mentioned special construction consists in the following. Let an inertial RF
have three mutually perpedicular rigid coordinate axes realized as rods joined together at
one point (the spatial origin), with the same scale unit along all the three axes; we thus
assume that the 3-dimensional Euclidian geometry is an appropriate model for description
of properties of rigid bodies. To synchronize the clocks, a suﬃcient number of completely
identical clocks are prepared at the spatial origin, say. Then each clock is slowly transported
to its designated spatial position so that a suﬃciently dense network of clocks is obtained.
The above special construction is applied to every inertial RF in question separately

from any other RF. Let us refer to such a construction as standard autonomous.

We may conjecture that any two inertial RFs, located in the same small region of the
space-time and obtained via a standard autonomous construction, “can be adjusted via re-
orientation and isotropic rescaling to a reciprocal and isotropic pair of RFs”; the terms in the
latter quoted phrase are to be understood as physical objects and relations corresponding
to their model counterparts.

Thus, the hypothesis is that all the pairs of inertial RFs obtained via a standard au-
tonomous construction are adequately modeled by the notion of natural pairs. Hence, by
Part 2 of Proposition 31, page 33 (cf. Section IV D), the local sign of the constant C is
uniquely determined. Thereby, the most important local characteristic of the spacetime –
the local type of the spacetime geometry, whether positive-Lorentzian or negative-Lorentzian
– is determined by means of any pair of inertial RFs not at rest relative to each other, ob-
tained via a standard autonomous construction and located in a spacetime neighborhood of
the given point of the spacetime.

Obviously, all the construction processes within a standard autonomous construction can
be performed with however small accelerations as well as speeds. This allows one to avoid
in principle the diﬃculty with the procedure described in Introduction, where measuring
devices had to be transported from one RF into another, moving with a nonzero speed v
relative to the ﬁrst one.

21

F. Proper pairs of RFs

Let (f, g) be a pair of mutually URMoving RFs and let A := Ag,f . Let us call the pair
11 A10 = 0 (recall (4), page 15); otherwise, let

(f, g) improper if A11 is non-singular and A01A−1
us call the pair (f, g) proper.

Let us call the pair (f, g) strictly proper if A00

= 0, A11 is non-singular, and A01A−1

11 A10

=

0.

It is easy to see that any adjustment without re-synchronization (as deﬁned in Subsection
II D, page 16) does not turn a proper pair of RFs into an improper one, or vice versa. A
similar statement is true regarding strictly proper pairs.

Note that improper, or even not strictly proper, pairs of RFs are exceptions, which
cannot be possibly detected experimentally; indeed, no elements of the matrix A := Ag,f
can be precisely determined because of random errors inherent in any physical measurement.
At times, we exclude improper and not strictly proper pairs of RFs to avoid too many
technicalities arising in the exceptional, inessential cases. Nevertheless, a reader who is
interested in exploring the nature of these exceptions a little further may want to continue
reading this subsection for such details.

Given any two mutually URMoving RFs f and g, let us write the matrix A := Ag,f as

A =

may be called the gradient of the f -time t relative to the g-space r′, or the spatial gradient of
asynchrony of f relative to g. Since t = A00t′ + A01r′, one can say that the f -time coordinate
t of an event e depends only on the g-time coordinate t′ of e and on the orthogonal projection
of the g-space coordinate vector r′ of e onto the gradient gradr′t.

In these terms, pair (f, g) being improper means that the gradient gradr′t is orthogonal

to the velocity

an event e depends – in addition to tg(e) – only on the component of the g-space coordinate
vector rg(e) in a direction perpendicular to the velocity vf,g of RF f relative to RF g. Such
a situation would probably seem counterintuitive.

Remark: Interpretation of the boost-orientation representation

Let RFs f and g be such that Ag,f = A. Then, according to (5), page 15, the unique v in
the representation (12) coincides with vg,f , the velocity of g relative to f . Matrix BC,v may
be called a C-boost matrix or, more exactly, the matrix of the C-boost in the direction of v.
Respectively, BC,e
∞ may be called an inﬁnite C-boost matrix or, more exactly, the matrix of
an inﬁnite C-boost in the direction of e; in case (13) takes place, the velocity of g relative
to f is inﬁnite. Next, ε and Q represent the mutual orientation of RFs f and g in time
and space, respectively; indeed, consider RF ˜g := diag(ε, Q)g, which is a re-orientation of
RF g; then (12) implies f = BC,v˜g, so that the matrix A˜g,f coincides with BC,v. Next, P v
is the matrix of the orthogonal projection of R3 onto the direction of v, and so, Sv has a
transparent geometrical interpretation: for any vector u in R3, Svu is the vector obtained
from u by stretching γv times the component of u parallel to v while leaving the component
of u perpendicular to v unchanged; note that the stretch coeﬃcient γv tends to 1 and hence
Sv tends to S0 = I3 as v tends to 0.

Remark: 0-Lorentzian transformations

4 real matrix A is 0-Lorentzian if and only if A00 =

The structure of the 0-Lorentzian transformations as deﬁned above is trivial: a non-singular
1 and A01 = 0T (remember (4), page

5, page 47.

We see that there are “too many” 0-Lorentzian transformations; the cause is that the
CI3) in the deﬁnition (10) is triply degenerate if C = 0, and so, the above

matrix diag(1,
deﬁnition of the 0-Lorentzian transformations is insuﬃciently restrictive in this case.

−

We shall therefore redeﬁne the notion of the 0-Lorentzian transformations by means of
an additional requirement of continuity in C. Namely, further on let us refer to a matrix as
0 of both the set of all C-Lorentzian matrices
0-Lorentzian if it is a limiting point as C
with C > 0 and the set of all C-Lorentzian matrices with C < 0.

It is obvious that no sequence of matrices of the form (13) has a limit as C

by Proposition 5, a matrix A is 0-Lorentzian if and only if it has the form (12) with C = 0,

B. Level 0: without any assumptions, any two mutually URMoving RFs are
adjustable to a C-Lorentzian pair

10.

Theorem: Any pair of RFs is C-Lorentzian up to rescaling and re-synchronization

For any real C, any pair of mutually URMoving RFs can be adjusted to a C-Lorentzian
pair. By Remark 3, page 19, this can be done by rescaling and re-synchronization only. ✷

11.

Remark: Scalar C-boost adjustment

Furthermore, any pair pair of mutually URMoving RFs can be adjusted to a scalar C-boost
✷
pair, for any given real C.

Since for any real C, there obviously exist both a C-boost pair of RFs not at rest relative
to each other and a C-boost pair of RFs at rest relative to each other, Theorem 10 and
Remark 11 are immediate from the following general result.

12.

Theorem: Adjustment can turn almost any RFCT into almost any other RFCT

Suppose that an RF g is URMoving relative to an RF f and an RF g1 is URMoving relative
to an RF f1. Then the following two conditions are equivalent to each other:

1. there exists an adjustment ( ˜f , ˜g) of the pair (f, g) such that the RFCT

˜g, ˜f is the

A

same as

g1,f1;

A

26

6
2. Either (i) vg,f

= 0 and vg1,f1

= 0 or (ii) vg,f = 0 and vg1,f1 = 0.

✷

Thus, Theorem 12 says that the only invariant of the RFCT under adjustment is whether

or not the corresponding pair of RFs are at rest relative to each other.

This can also be expressed as follows: The only invariant of the RFCT under adjustment
of the pair of RFs is whether or not the two RFs are adjustments of each other. This latter
restatement of Theorem 12 may at ﬁrst glance seem trivial but it certainly is not so – the
emphasis here is on the “the only”. Since the condition that two RFs are at rest relative
to each other, i.e. that the relative velocity is precisely zero, cannot possibly be detected
experimentally, one can also somewhat loosely restate Theorem 12 as above: Adjustment
can turn almost any RFCT into almost any other RFCT.

Note also that the ﬁrst of the two equivalent conditions in Theorem 12 can be restated as
follows: (f, g) can be adjusted to a pair ( ˜f, ˜g) which is the same as (f1, g1) up to re-labeling
of events (recall Proposition 1, page 12).

Proof of Theorem 12 is given in Appendix 3, page 48.

13.

Remark: “Symmetric” form of Theorem 12

It is easy to see, either from the proof of Theorem 12 or directly, that the ﬁrst of the two
equivalent conditions of Theorem 12 can be restated in the following symmetric manner,
formally better reﬂecting the exchangeability of the roles of the pairs (f, g) and (f1, g1):
pairs of RFs (f, g) and (f1, g1) can be adjusted to some other two pairs of RFs ( ˜f, ˜g) and
( ˜f1, ˜g1), respectively, so that
g1,f1; in other words, pairs (f, g) and (f1, g1) can be
adjusted to some other two pairs of RFs, which are the same up to re-labeling of events. ✷

Theorem 10 and Proposition 2, page 18, imply that any pair of RFs can be adjusted,
for any prescribed real C, to a C-Lorentzian pair by means of the four types of adjustment
described in Subsection II D. In this sense, the phenomenon of the RFCT being positive-
Lorentzian (or 0-Lorentzian or negative-Lorentzian or any other) is seen merely as a matter
of an appropriate adjustment, which may appear rather surprising. In particular, what may
seem surprising is that any positive-Lorentzian pair of RFs can be made just by a choice
of adjustment, at one’s will, into either a 0-Lorentzian or a negative-Lorentzian pair, any
0-Lorentzian pair – into either a positive-Lorentzian or a negative-Lorentzian one, and any
negative-Lorentzian pair of RFs – into either a positive-Lorentzian or a 0-Lorentzian one.

In connection with Theorem 10, one could ask, When is it possible to adjust only one of
two URMoving RFs so that the resulting pair of RFs is C-Lorentzian? The next theorem
provides a complete answer to this question.

14.

Theorem: Unilateral C-Lorentzian adjustment

Let f and g be two RFs, URMoving relative to each other. Let v := vg,f and let C be a
real number such that Cv2 < 1 (assuming that 0
). Then RF g can be adjusted
via rescaling and re-synchronization to an RF ˜g such that the pair (f, ˜g) is C-Lorentzian. ✷

Remark: Necessity of Cv2 < 1 for unilateral C-Lorentzian adjustment
The condition Cv2 < 1 is not only suﬃcient in Theorem 14 but necessary as well. Indeed, if ˜g
is an adjustment of g, i.e. if ˜g is at rest relative to g, then it is easy to see that v˜g,f = vg,f = v.
Hence, the condition Cv2 < 1 is necessary for the pair (f, ˜g) to be C-Lorentzian, in view of

C. Level 0: Universal C-Lorentzian adjustment

Given a C-Lorentzian pair of RFs (f, g) with vg,f

= 0, C is uniquely determined, ac-
cording to Remark 8, page 25. So, C serves to relate RFs f and g for all events e. In this
sense, C is constant.

Suppose now that one has to deal with more than two RFs, so that there are at least
three RFs f1, f2, and f3 under consideration. Let us ﬁx any real number C. By Theorem
10, each of the pairs p1 := (f2, f3), p2 := (f1, f3), and p3 := (f1, f2) can be adjusted to a C-
Lorenzian pair, to obtain C-Lorentzian pairs ˜p1 := ( ˜f 1
2 ),
respectively; the superscripts here refer to the corresponding pair. Thus, for each of the three
RFs f1, f2, and f3, one has two adjustments, e.g. two adjustments ˜f 2
1 of f1, depending
into which of the two pairs the RF is included. One may now ask whether this dependence
of the C-Lorentzian adjustment on the pair of RFs can be avoided. A positive and more
general answer to this question will be given below in this section.

Now, the more general question that we want to consider is the existence of a

C-Lorentzian universal adjustment of a given family of RFs. The next theorem shows that
a C-Lorentzian universal adjustment always exists if C < 0; for C
0, certain general
conditions must be satisﬁed in order for a C-Lorentzian universal adjustment to exist. In
other words, there always exists a negative-Lorentzian universal adjustment, and this is not
so for either positive-Lorentzian or negative-Lorentzian adjustments. Thus, the negative-
Lorentzian adjustment is more “universal”, so to speak, than either the positive-Lorentzian
or 0-Lorentzian ones.

D. Level 1: Given only reciprocity, only spatial adjustment may be needed

Given two pairs (f1, g1) and (f2, g2) of mutually URMoving RFs, let us call the two pairs

spatially similar if there exists a non-singular 3

3 real matrix S such that

×

f2 = diag(1, S)f1

and g2 = diag(1, S)g1.

(27)

In other words, two pairs (f1, g1) and (f2, g2) of RFs are spatially similar if f2 and g2 may
be obtained from f1 and g1, respectively, by means of one and the same spatial adjustment.
Obviously, if two pairs of RFs are spatially similar, then they are adjustable to each

other without re-synchronization.

Observe that two pairs (f1, g1) and (f2, g2) of RFs are spatially similar if and only if

Ag1,f1 = diag(1, S−1) Ag2,f2 diag(1, S),

Theorem: Reciprocity implies spatial similarity to a generalized Lorentzian pair

pair.

Remark: Improper reciprocal pairs are asymptotically spatially similar to 0-

Lorentzian pairs
Any improper reciprocal pair of RFs (f, g) is asymptotically spatially similar to a
0-Lorentzian pair in the sense that there exists a sequence of pairs of RFs (fk, gk), which
are spatially similar to (f, g) and such that limk→∞ Afk,gk exists and is 0-Lorentzian, i.e.,
Galilean. The relation of being spatially similar is carried here, as in (27), by spatial trans-
formations whose matrices Sk or their inverses S−1

The following theorem provides an interesting connection between reciprocity and
rescaling to a generalized Lorentzian pair. It is immediate from Theorem 19, Proposition 2
(page 18), Remark 3 (page 19), Proposition 5 (page 23), and Remark 21.

22.

Theorem: Reciprocity and generalized Lorentzian rescaling

A proper pair (f, g) of RFs can be adjusted without re-synchronization to a generalized
Lorentzian pair of RFs if and only if it can be adjusted without re-synchronization to a
✷
reciprocal pair of RFs.

Note that by Remark 3, page 19, the phrase “adjusted without re-synchronization to a
generalized Lorentzian pair” in the statement of Theorem 22 can be replaced by “rescaled
to a generalized Lorentzian pair”.

Some further details on adjustment without re-synchronization can be found in Subsec-

tion III I, page 35.

E. Another Level 1: Given isotropy, only isotropic rescaling and re-synchronization
may be needed

Euclidian geometry is usually assumed – tacitly or explicitly – as the model for the spatial
component of the spacetime in accounts of the special theory of relativity. In reality, this
assumption corresponds to certain assumed properties of rigid bodies. In this subsection,
we establish a necessary and suﬃcient condition characterizing such an assumption.

We begin with the following.

Theorem: Given isotropy, only isotropic rescaling and re-synchronization may be

needed
Let C be any real number. Then any strictly proper isotropic pair of RFs can be adjusted
✷
via isotropic rescaling and re-synchronization to a C-Lorentzian pair.

This theorem should be compared with Theorem 10, page 26; without the isotropy

assumption, anisotropic rescaling may be needed.

The isotropy condition in Theorem 23 can be relaxed to the following weak isotropy

version of it.

It follows form Proposition 4, page 20, that every isotropic pair of RFs is weakly-isotropic.
The essential diﬀerence between the notions of isotropic and weakly-isotropic pairs of RFs
is that for the latter, the space intervals are considered only for pairs of events simultaneous

Theorem 23 is immediate from the following more detailed result.

24.

Theorem: Characterization of anisotropy-free adjustment

Let C be any real number. Let (f, g) be a strictly proper pair of RFs. Then (f, g) can be
adjusted via isotropic rescaling and re-synchronization to a proper C-Lorentzian pair of RFs
( ˜f , ˜g) if and only if it can be adjusted via spatial re-orientation to a weakly-isotropic pair of
RFs ( ˆf , ˆg).
✷

25.

Remark: Uniqueness

1. The proper C-Lorentzian adjustment ( ˜f, ˜g) of (f, g) in Theorem 24 can be chosen so
that (i) ( ˜f , ˜g) is C-boost, i.e., A˜g, ˜f = BC,u for some u, (ii) ˜g is obtained from g by
isotropic rescaling and spatial re-orientation only, and (iii) ˜f is obtained from f by
0, then ˜f may be taken to be
re-synchronization and temporal rescaling only; if C
just a re-synchronization of f – no temporal adjustment is then needed.

Remark: Weak isotropy vs. isotropy

Let (f, g) be a strictly proper reciprocal and weakly isotropic pair of RFs. Since (f, g) is
reciprocal, by Theorem 19, page 30, (f, g) can be rescaled, and hence adjusted without re-
synchronization, to a generalized Lorentzian pair ( ˆf , ˆg). On the other hand, since (f, g) is
weakly isotropic, by Theorem 24 (f, g) can be adjusted via re-synchronization and isotropic
spatial rescaling to a generalized Lorentzian pair ( ˇf , ˇg), perhaps diﬀerent from ( ˆf, ˆg).

The question is, Can one always choose ( ˆf , ˆg) and ( ˇf, ˇg) to be the same, so that (f, g)
can be isotropically adjusted to a generalized Lorentzian pair? The answer is no; see a

I. More on generalized Lorentzian adjustment without re-synchronization, or
rescaling

Of the four types of adjustment, listed in Subsection II D, page 16, it is rather certainly
re-synchronization that seems to be the least desirable, as the one most substantially af-
fecting the relation of temporal measurements with spatial ones. One could therefore ask:
When a pair of mutually URMoving RFs is adjustable without re-synchronization to a gen-
eralized Lorentzian pair? A characterization of such pairs in terms of adjustment without
re-synchronization to reciprocal pairs of RFs was given by Theorem 22, page 31; once again,
by Remark 3, page 19, generalized Lorentzian adjustment without re-synchronization means
the same as generalized Lorentzian rescaling.

In this subsection, it is shown that pairs of RFs that can be rescaled to generalized
Lorentzian pairs constitute, in a certain sense, a majority of pairs of mutually URMoving
RFs.

Moreover, it is possible to give a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence
of a generalized Lorentzian rescaling of a pair (f, g) of mutually URMoving RFs in terms
of the RFCT matrix Ag,f . That condition is rather cumbersome if given with the utmost
generality, accounting for a number of exceptions of purely mathematical character, which
cannot even be experimentally detected. However, if the consideration is restricted to the
strictly proper pairs, deﬁned in Subsection II F, page 22, then the necessary and suﬃcient
condition can be expressed quite simply.

35

36.

Theorem: A majority of pairs of RFs admit a generalized Lorentzian rescaling

Let C be any nonzero real number. Let (f, g) be a strictly proper pair of mutually URMoving
RFs and let A := Ag,f . Then (f, g) can be rescaled (or, equivalently, adjusted without re-
synchronization) to a C-Lorentzian pair of RFs if and only if µ < 1 and Cµ > 0, where

µ := µg,f :=

Thus indeed, a generalized Lorentzian rescaling exists for a “majority” of pairs of

URMoving RFs: if µ

IV. TESTING RECIPROCITY AND/OR ISOTROPY AND EXECUTING AN
APPROPIATE GENERALIZED LORENTZIAN ADJUSTMENT

In this section, we summarize developed in the previous sections special theories of relativ-
ity in order to consider relevant problems of testing of reciprocity and isotropy assumptions
and the corresponding problems of execution of adjustment.

Let (f, g) be a strictly proper pair of mutually URMoving RFs, so that the relative
velocity v := vg,f is ﬁnite and nonzero. Physically, as explained in Introduction and Section
II, the notion of such a pair may have many diﬀerent kinds of physical realization. However,
of foremost interest to us here is the standard autonomous construction for inertial RFs,
described in Subsection II E, which will be assumed in this section.

Our main objective in this section is to propose a method to test the hypothesis that all
the pairs of inertial RFs obtained via a standard autonomous construction are adequately
modeled by the notion of natural pairs. Recall that a pair of mutually URMoving RFs
(f, g) is deﬁned as natural if it can be adjusted via re-orientation and isotropic rescaling to
a reciprocal and isotropic pair of RFs. Thus, to test whether a pair of RFs is natural means
to test properties of reciprocity and isotropy. We approach this task at the three main levels
described in Introduction, page 10.

But before we proceed towards that end, we shall indicate how to test whether the two
so constructed physical RFs can be adequately described as a a pair of mutually URMoving

RFs (f, g). That will be the case whenever the RFCT

and g, assuming that the X ′

“observers” can test whether the RFCT is indeed aﬃne, that is, whether the two physical
RFs under consideration may be described, with an appropriate degree of accuracy, as
mutually URMoving. (To exchange the information on the identiﬁcation of the events and

on their time-space measurements, the “observers” in f and g must each possess a signal
with the relative speed greater than the relative speed of the other RF.)

A. Level 0: Executing an appropiate generalized Lorentzian adjustment with no
assumptions on a pair of mutually URMoving RFs

By Theorem 10, page 26, for any real C, any pair of mutually URMoving RFs can be
adjusted to a C-Lorentzian pair. Therefore, if all the types of adjustment listed in Subsection
II D are permitted, then the only testing needed here is the described above testing whether
the two RFs in question are mutually URMoving.

Hence, at Level 0, it only remains to show how to execute an appropiate generalized

Lorentzian adjustment.

If Cv2 < 1 (recall, v := vg,f was supposed to be ﬁnite and nonzero) then, by Theorem

34, page 34, there exists a unique adjustment

˜g :=

τ bT
0

S (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(30)

of RF g such that the pair (f, ˜g) is C-boost. Even when the condition Cv2 < 1 is not satisﬁed
for the given pair (f, g) and a given C, it is satisﬁed if f is replaced by an appropriate (say
temporal) adjustment ˜f of f

note that if ˜f = diag(τ, I3)f , then vg, ˜f =

vg,f
.
τ !

Thus, without loss of generality, the condition Cv2 < 1 may be assumed to take place.
Then all the parameters of the needed here adjustment (30) can be uniquely determined
using relations (A91), (A93), (A92), and (A94), established below in Appendix 13, page 61:

where v := vg,f and γv are computed according (5), page 15, and (15), page 24, respectively.
It is seen that neither the value nor the sign of C is determined by the mere fact that a

pair (f, g) can be adjusted to a C-Lorentzian pair.

B. Level 1: Testing reciprocity only and executing an appropiate generalized
Lorentzian adjustment

According to our hypothesis in its strongest form, all the pairs of inertial RFs obtained
via a standard autonomous construction are adequately modeled by the notion of natural
pairs and thus can be adjusted via re-orientation and isotropic rescaling to a reciprocal and
isotropic pair of RFs.

However, in this subsection we want to describe a method of testing of reciprocity only,
rather than of both reciprocity and isotropy, and describe how to execute a corresponding
generalized Lorentzian adjustment.

38

Because our construction is autonomous, there is no reason to expect that the given
pair of RFs (f, g) will be reciprocal by itself, without any adjustment. At the same time,
re-synchronization is not needed here. Moreover, if re-synchronization were allowed here as
well, than in view of Theorem 12, page 26, reciprocity could not be possibly tested.

By Theorem 22, page 31, (f, g) can be can be adjusted without re-synchronization to a
reciprocal pair of RFs if and only if it can be rescaled (or, equivalently, adjusted without
re-synchronization) to a generalized Lorentzian pair of RFs; in turn, by Theorem 36, page
36, this is equivalent to the system of two inequalities

µ < 1 and Cµ > 0,

(31)

where µ :=

11 A10

A01A−1
A00

.

Thus, this system of inequalities constitutes a deﬁnitive test of the reciprocity or, more

exactly, a test of the adjustability without re-synchronization to a reciprocal pair.

In case the results of this test are positive, appropriate (but not unique at that) adjust-
ments ˜f := diag(1, N −1)f and ˜g := diag(τ, M)g of RFs f and g, such that the pair ( ˜f , ˜g) is
C-boost, are described by the formulas

that precedes (A111)].

×

By the second inequality in (31), the sign of C is uniquely determined by the pair (f, g).
However, in view of Remark 38, page 37, with the reciprocity property only, the sign of
C can hardly be considered a local property of the physical spacetime, since a universal
generalized Lorentzian rescaling of a pairwise reciprocal family need not exist. Moreover,
the sign of C may depend on the choice of the pair of RFs (f, g) in such a family. E.g., if
RFs f , g, and h are such that Ag,f = BC1,v and Ah,g = BC2,u are scalar boost matrices with,
say, C1 = 1, v = 0.2, C2 = 3, and u = 0.1, then one has µh,f < 0, and so, by (31), pair
of RFs (f, h) can be rescaled to a C-Lorentzian pair only with C < 0, while C1 > 0 and
C2 > 0.

C. Another Level 1: Testing isotropy only and executing an appropiate generalized
Lorentzian adjustment

In this subsection we want to describe methods of testing of the condition of weak
isotropy. Again, although the spacetime may be adequately described as isotropic in a
domain containing the given pair of RFs (f, g), there is no reason to expect that (f, g) will
be isotropic or weakly isotropic as it is, without any adjustment – because the physical
construction is autonomous for each of the two RFs under consideration.

According to Theorem 24, page 32, (f, g) can be adjusted via spatial re-orientation to a
weakly-isotropic pair of RFs ( ˆf , ˆg) if and only if it can be adjusted via isotropic rescaling
and re-synchronization to a proper C-Lorentzian pair of RFs ( ˜f , ˜g).

It can be seen from the proof of Theorem 24 [cf. (A42), page 53] that (f, g) can be

in (35) is large enough so that u can be deﬁned by (38); in particular, if C
0, then τ1 may
be taken to be any nonzero real number.

≥

It is seen that neither the value nor even the sign of C is uniquely determined by the
mere fact that a pair (f, g) can be adjusted via isotropic rescaling and re-synchronization to
a C-Lorentzian pair.

D. Level 2: Testing reciprocity and isotropy and executing an appropiate generalized
Lorentzian adjustment

In this subsection, we shall describe how to test the full content of our main hypothesis
that all the pairs of inertial RFs obtained via a standard autonomous construction are
adequately modeled by the notion of natural pairs and thus can be adjusted via re-orientation
and isotropic rescaling to a reciprocal and isotropic pair of RFs. We shall also describe how
to execute an appropriate generalized Lorentzian adjustment, which will be shown to be
unique in a certain sense. What is even more important, it will be shown that the constant
C can also be uniquely determined here.

40

By Theorem 28, page 33, pair (f, g) is natural if and only if it can be isotropically rescaled
to a generalized Lorentzian pair. Therefore, in view of Proposition 5, page 23, pair (f, g)
is natural if and only if if the RFCT matrix A := Ag,f admits a representation of the form
(A105), page 63, with N = ξ1I3 and M = ξQ for some positive real ξ and ξ1, and some
1 , ξ1v diag(1, ξ1I3). Hence,
orthogonal 3
without loss of generality, we shall assume that ξ1 = 1, so that the condition that (f, g) is
natural may be rewritten as

Eqs. (42) and (40) uniquely determine v =

(= vg,f ). Note next that the existence of an

orthogonal matrix Q satisfying (43) is equivalent to the condition

for some ξ > 0.

Thus, (44) uniquely determines ξ > 0; alternatively and equivalently, ξ may be uniquely
determined by (A44), page 53, which follows from (A42), which follows from (43). Also,
(43) implies

This implies γvξvT Q =

vT A11. Hence, given (43), equation (41) can be rewriten as

This uniquely determines the value of C, say by the formula

Q =

ξ−1(Sv)−1A11.

A01 = CvT A11.

C =

.

Hence, τ is uniquely determined by (40), and Q is uniquely determined by (45), taking into
account (16) and (15), page 24.

Note that representation (39) means that the pair (f, ˜g) is C-boost, where ˜g :=

diag(τ, ξQ)g is an adjustment of g obtained via re-orientation and isotropic rescaling.

Thus, all the elements of representation (39) – C, v, τ , ξ, and Q – are uniquely deter-
mined. In particular, the adjustment (f, ˜g) of pair (f, g) is uniquely determined. But the
most important fact here is that the value of C is uniquely determined.

Moreover, in view of Theorem 29 (or Theorem 30) and Proposition 31, page 33, the sign
of C can be considered truly a local property of the physical spacetime provided that the
main hypothesis is true in its full form, as stated in the beginning of this subsection.

At the same time, one has a deﬁnitive test as to whether (f, g) is natural, i.e., can be
adjusted via re-orientation and isotropic rescaling to a reciprocal and isotropic pair of RFs.
This test consists of the following two conditions [cf. (46) and (44)]:

Remark: Wave duality between time and space

System (49)–(50) is self-dual in the sense that it remains invariant when the “new” temporal
coordinate τ is interchanged with the “new” spatial coordinate ξ and, simultaneously, the
“old” temporal coordinate t is interchanged with the “old” spatial coordinate x. Therefore,
given a family of solutions τ = τ (t, x) and ξ = ξ(t, x) of system (49)–(50), one can obtain
another, dual, family of solutions ˆτ (t, x) := ξ(x, t) and ˆξ(t, x) := τ (x, t) by such interchanging
of variables. Obviously, if a family of solutions of (49)–(50) is dual to another family, then
vice versa is also true, so that one can refer in this case to the two families as to a dual
pair. If a family of solutions of (49)–(50) is dual to itself, let us call it self-dual. To avoid
misunderstanding, note that in a self-dual family of solutions of (49)–(50), every member of
the family is dual to a possibly diﬀerent member of the same family, not necessarily to itself.
Note also that any family of solutions of (49)–(50) can be (at least formally) extended to a
self-dual family, namely, to the union of the given family with its dual.

In the next two subsections, we shall present, as two models, two dual pairs of explicitly
described families of non-linear solutions of (49)–(50). The two families of the ﬁrst dual pair
are identical to each other, so that in fact one has one self-dual family. In contrast, the two
✷
families of the second dual pair are diﬀerent from each other.

As an immediate consequence to Remark 39, one has the following, dual to (54), equation:

Remark: Wave interpretation of C

Recall that any equation of the form ψ = ψ(αt + βx), with β
propagating along the x-axis with constant velocity

= 0, represents a wave

Hence, τ and ξ, the solutions to the wave equations (54) and (55), may be considered
as the time wave and the space wave, respectively, propagating along the x-axis with not
necessarily constant velocities

In view of the C´auchy–Kowalevsky Theorem, one can impose arbitrary analytical initial
conditions on τt, τx, ξt, and ξx in problem (49)–(50). Thus, there exist solutions of (49)–(50)
with local values of C of both signs, depending on the point in the spacetime.

We shall present three explicitly given families of nonlinear solutions of (49)–(50). For
each solution belonging to the ﬁrst of these families, C may take on values of both signs,
depending on t and x. For each solution belonging to either of the other two families, C is
everywhere positive.

In search of an interesting family of explicit solutions of system (49)–(50) or, equivalently,
ut) as a solution to (54) –
(54) or (55), one could ﬁrst try a single wave – say τ = τ (x
propagating with a constant velocity u along the x-axis. However, as it is easy to see, that
would lead only to the trivial family of linear solutions of (49)–(50) that correspond to the
scalar C-boost matrices (48) independent of X = (t, x, y, z)T , with τt, τx, ξt, and ξx being
arbitrary constants satisfying (49)–(50).

What is more interesting is that family (60)–(61) is self-dual in the sense of Remark 39:
when τ is interchanged with ξ and, simultaneously, t is interchanged with x, any member
of the family (60)–(61) turns into another member of the same family, with certain “dual”
values of the numerical parameters ε1, ε2, C lin, v, τ0, and ξ0, and the functional parameter

Recall that C lin can take on values of either sign. Therefore, in the case when the

positive or everywhere negative. On the other hand, taking e.g. ψ(λ) := ln

Proof of Proposition 5

Let matrix A be partitioned as in (4), page 15. It is C-Lorentzian if and only if (10), page
23, takes place or, equivalently,

First, it is straightforward to check that either (12) or (13) implies that A is C-Lorentzian.
On the other hand, (12) can be rewritten as the system of equations

Note that (A4) and (15) imply

which excludes case (13), in particular. Moreover, (A4), (A6), and (A7) yield

Hence, ε and v are uniquely determined by A, and Q is uniquely determined by A and C.
Note also that (A1) and (A10) imply Cv2 < 1, so that (15) makes sense.

Thus, in case (A8), it suﬃces to show that equations (A1)–(A3) together with (A9)–
(A11) imply that Q is orthogonal and that equations (A4)–(A7) hold. It is easy to check
that

i.e., Q is indeed orthogonal. Next, (A1), (A10), (A9), and (15) imply (A4). Further, (A4)
and (A10) yield (A6), and (A11) is equivalent to (A7). Finally, (A11), (A12), (17), and (A2)
imply (A5).

It remains to consider the case when (A8) is false. In this case, (A1) implies C < 0.

CA10eT Q = A10A01, and so, by (A15),

Thus, e and Q are uniquely determined by A and C. It remains to show that eT e = 1 and
that Q is orthogonal. But eT e = 1 follows from (A16), (A1), and A00 = 0, while QT Q = I3

Let us now return to Proof of Theorem 12.

That Condition 1 of Theorem 12 implies
Condition 2 therein follows immediately from the deﬁnition of adjustment in terms of being

48

relatively at rest, which implies transitivity: if an RF h is an adjustment of (i.e., is at rest
relative to) an RF g and RF g is an adjustment of (i.e., is at rest relative to) an RF f , then
RF h is an adjustment of (i.e., is at rest relative to) RF f .

It remains to prove that Condition 2 of Theorem 12 implies Condition 1.
Let A := Ag,f and B := Ag1,f1, where the pairs (f, g) and (f1, g1) satisfy Condition 2 of
Theorem 12. According to (6), page 16, it remains to show that there are two nonsingular
matrices of the form

B10B01 is non-singular. Since A is non-singular, one can
by Lemma 4, the matrix B00B11
always choose a nonzero real number τ1 and a vector b1
= 0. In
fact, A10 and B10 are either both nonzero or both zero, because of the condition that f and
g are not at rest relative to each other and f1 and g1 are not at rest relative to each other
or, alternatively, f and g are at rest relative to each other and f1 and g1 are at rest relative
to each other. Hence, one can always ﬁnd a non-singular matrix S1 to satisfy (A21). Then,
all the relations (A19)–(A22) will take place if τ , b, and S are given by (A23)–(A25). Note

Now we can demonstrate the second, uniqueness statement of Remark 25. We see that
ε is uniquely determined by (A49). Also, since v = vg,f is uniquely determined by the pair
(f, g), the value of ξ is uniquely determined by (A44). Therefore, τ is uniquely determined
by (A50). Next, the direction and the length of u are uniquely determined by (A38) and
(A40), respectively. Now one can compute also γ using (A37). Then Q = Qε is uniquely
determined by (A45), and so, b1 is uniquely determined by (A47), and ﬁnally, b is uniquely
determined by (A51).

It remains to prove the “if” part of Theorem 24 and the ﬁrst part of Remark 25. Thus,
suppose that the pair (f, g) can be adjusted via spatial re-orientation to a weakly-isotropic
pair ( ˆf , ˆg). Without loss of generality, one may assume that (f, g) itself is weakly-isotropic.

Proof of Theorem 29

F

The “if” part is immediate from Theorem 28. To prove the “only if” part, let us assume
that

is a natural family of RFs.

By Theorem 28, for each pair of RFs (f, g) in

there exist a real number C f,g and
positive real numbers τ f,g, ξf,g, τ g,f , and ξg,f such that the isotropically rescaled pair ( ˜f g, ˜gf )
is C f,g-Lorentzian, where ˜f g := diag(τ f,g, ξf,gI3)f and ˜gf := diag(τ g,f , ξg,f I3)g.

Therefore, without loss of generality, one may assume that

(since for such f and g, one will have v

Now, let us ﬁrst consider the case of non-collinearity when there are three RFs f , g1, and

g2 in

F

.

Conditions (ii) and (iii) imply that for every g in

, either vg,f and vg1,f are non-collinear
or vg,f and vg2,f are non-collinear. Thus, in the non-collinearity case it remains to prove the
following.

F

Suppose that f , g, and h are three RFs such that (i) vg,f and vh,f are linearly independent
and (ii) the pairs (f, g), (f, h), and (˜g, h) are C1-, C2-, and C3-Lorentzian, respectively, for
some real C1, C2, and C3 and for some isotropic rescaling ˜g = diag(τ, ξI3)g of g, where τ
and ξ are some positive reals. Then C1 = C2; note that, because of the group property,
C1 = C2 = C for some C would imply that the pair (g, h) is C-Lorentzian, as well as (f, g)
and (f, h) are.

Let A := Ag,f and B := Ah,f .

In view of Proposition 5, page 23, and because re-
orientation preserves C-Lorentzian pairs, one may assume without loss of generality that
A = BC1,v or A = BC1,e1
and B = BC2,u or B = BC2,e2
for some v, u, and unit e1
and e2 in R3 such that v or e1 is linearly independent of u or e2, as applicable. Then
Ag,h = B−1A = BA, and A˜g,h = BAdiag(τ, ξI3)−1.

Consider ﬁrst the case of the ﬁnite relative velocities, when A = BC1,v and B = BC2,u.
Since (˜g, h) is C3-Lorentzian and in view of deﬁnition (10), page 23, and identity (BC,v)−1 =

pairs (f, g), (f, h), and (˜g, h) are C1-, C2-, and C3-Lorentzian, respectively, with C1 := 1,

Consider second R2 in place of R3. One counterexample for this case is as follows. Let
C2 be any negative real. Let ξ be any positive real except 1. Let C1 := C2ξ2, C3 := C2ξ−2,
and τ := ξ−2. Let e1 and e2 be any two orthogonal unit vectors in R2. For any negative
real C and any unit vector e in R2, let us deﬁne here BC,e
∞ as in (19), page 24, but with I2 in
place of I3. Let now f be any RF, and deﬁne RFs g, h, and ˜g by g := BC1,e1
∞ f ,
and ˜g := diag(τ, ξI2)g. Then the pairs (f, g) and (f, h) are obviously C1- and C2-Lorentzian.
Also, the pair (˜g, h) is C3-Lorentzian, since

where the matrix Q := e1eT

Let now

stand for any one of the two above triples (f, g, h), constructed with R1 or R2
in place of R3. In either case, we have seen that every pair of RFs in
can be isotropically
rescaled to a generalized Lorentzian pair. Moreover, the pairs (f, g) and (f, h) are already
C1- and C2-Lorentzian.

Let us show now that there is no generalized Lorentzian isotropic rescaling ˆ

It follows from the second statement of Part 3 of Proposition 31, page 33, applied to
, that there exists at most one choice of τ g, ξg, τ h, and ξh given
(f, g) or (f, h) in place of
τ f and ξf and given that the pairs ( ˆf , ˆg) and ( ˆf , ˆh) are generalized Lorentzian. But it is
easy to check that the choice τ g := τ h := τ f and ξg := ξh := ξf makes the pairs ( ˆf , ˆg) and
( ˆf , ˆh) generalized Lorentzian, namely, ˆC1- and ˆC2-Lorentzian with ˆC1 := C2(τ f /ξf )2 and
ˆC2 := C2(τ f /ξf )2. Hence, this is the only choice of τ g, ξg, τ h, and ξh.

With such a choice, the pair (ˆg, ˆh) being generalized Lorentzian implies, in the same
manner, that (g, h) is so. But (˜g, h) is generalized Lorentzian as well, and ˜g = diag(τ, ξI) g
for some positive τ and ξ. It follows again from the second statement of Part 3 of Proposition
31 – applied now to (g, h) in place of
– that
τ = ξ = 1, which contradicts the above constructions, in which ξ (as well as τ ) diﬀers from

Theorem 34 is proved as well.

A14.

Proof of Theorem 36

The theorem can be restated as follows: Let C be any nonzero real number and let A := Ag,f
for a strictly proper pair of RFs (f, g). Then there exist some v
= 0, and non-
singular 3

3 matrices M and N such that

R3, real τ

∈

×

A = diag(1, N)BC,vdiag(τ, M)

(A105)

if and only if µ < 1 and Cµ > 0, where µ is given by (29), page 36. It is easy to see that
using here the matrix diag(1, N) of the form less general than that of diag(τ, M) in fact does
not diminish generality.

Rewrite (A105) as the system of equations

Substituting these expressions into (29), one has

γvCvT M,

A00 = γvτ,
A01 =
−
A10 = γvτ Nv,
A11 =

NSvM.

−

µ = Cv2,

which implies µ < 1, in order for γv to exist. Also, (A110), together with (29) and with
(f, g) being strictly proper, implies Cµ > 0. This demonstrates the “only if” part of the
theorem.

To prove the “if” part, observe ﬁrst that for any two vectors a and b in R3 such that
aT b > 0, there exists a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix P such that P a = b; for instance,
3 , where b2 and b3 are any vectors in R3, which are
choose P = (aT b)−1bbT + b2bT
orthogonal to a and, together with b, form a basis in R3 (e.g., one can take b2 := a
b
and then b3 := a

2 + b3bT

b2).

×

Hence, whenever aT b > 0, there exists a non-singular 3

3 matrix N such that

×

NN T a = b.

×

Now, apply this observation to the vectors

a := A00(AT

11)−1AT
01

and

b := CA10,

63

which satisfy the inequality aT b > 0, because aT b = CµA2

00 and Cµ > 0. Next, let

01.

(A114)

Then (A114), (A111), (A112), and (A113) imply Cv2 = CvT v = µ < 1, and so, γv can be
determined by (15), page 24. Solving now (A106) for τ and (A109) for M, one can easily
✷
check that all equations (A106)–(A109) are thus satisﬁed.

Therefore, if the triple (f, g, h) is can be adjusted without re-synchronization to a triple
( ˜f , ˜g, ˜h) such that the pairs ( ˜f , ˜g) and ( ˜f , ˜h) are generalized Lorentzian, then there exists a

(f, g, h) is not adjustable without re-synchronization to a triple ( ˜f , ˜g, ˜h) such that the pairs
( ˜f , ˜g) and ( ˜f , ˜h) are generalized Lorentzian, even though every pair of RFs among f , g, and
h is reciprocal and proper (and therefore can be rescaled to a generalized Lorentzian pair).

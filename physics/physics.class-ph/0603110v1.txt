The absence of “torque” in the Trouton-Noble
experiment

Abstract

The absence of any tendency toward rotation in the Trouton-Noble

experiment is given a simple explanation.

PACS numbers: 12.39.-x, 13.60.Hb, 13.88.+e, 14.20.Dh

A recent paper[1] considered the case of two charged particles, initially at
rest. The paper proposed the “paradox” that, in a moving Lorentz frame,
“torque” would be exerted on the pair of particles. The proposed scenario
is actually the setup of the Trouton-Noble (TN) experiment[2] performed in
1903. This experiment attempted to observe the torque on a charged capac-
itor in order to measure the velocity of the Earth’s movement through the
“aether”, with a null result. The experiment is described by Panofsky and
Phillips (P&P)[3] and the apparent “paradox” is discussed there.[4] P&P
make the unfortunate statement (on p. 349): “The torque predicted here
is real enough to an observer moving with a velocity u relative to the two
charges, and should in that case be measurable if there were no mechanical
considerations involved.” Further incorrect statements follow about “elastic
stresses” depending on the velocity.

The null result of the TN experiment is given a simple explanation in
Ref. [5], and the apparent “paradox” is seen to be due to misinterpretion of
pre-relativistic terminology. To clarify the situation, we repeat the derivation
q at rest in Lorentz
here. We consider two particles with charges +q and
system S′. The rate of change of momentum of either particle in a Lorentz
system S moving with velocity v with respect to S′ is given by Eq. (15.64)
of Ref[5](and in numerous other texts):

[1], [3], and [4] as evidence
of a “torque” acting on the particles. However, if we take “torque” to mean
tendency to rotate or change direction of motion, there is no torque acting.
This is easily seen by looking at the relation between dp
dt and acceleration a
(deﬁned as the rate of change of velocity), given by Eq. (15.4) of Ref. [5]:

This result shows that a is in the same direction as r. The change in
velocity will thus also be in the r direction and there is no tendency for
rotation. If “torque” is given the physical deﬁnition of “tendency to rotate”
there is no torque, and there is no paradox to explain. It is only if a deﬁnition
of “torque” taken over from pre-relativistic physics is used that confusion
enters.

We have considered the case of two point charges, while the TN experi-
ment was for a charged capacitor. The result above shows that there would
be no tendency to rotate for any pair of charges on opposite plates of a ca-
pacitor. Thus, there would be no tendency to rotate for the entire charge
distribution, which is the sum over such charge pairs.

I see two lessons from this simple exercise:

1. In applying special relativity, we must be careful if we use pre-relativistic
deﬁnitions and terminology. As examples, the use of terminology like
“force” and “torque” can lead to error unless there is careful deﬁnition
of precisely what is meant in the context of special relativity. Spe-
cial relativity is generally clearer if these intermediate terms are just
dispensed with.

2. We should treat any problem in the Lorentz system where it is simplest,
and rely on the Lorentz invariance of special relativity to preserve the
physics for any other Lorentz system. Doing a simple problem in an
awkward Lorentz system can lead to mathematical complexity with no
better understanding of the physics, and open the door to confusion.

contain the factor γ2 rather than just γ.

Abstract: This paper shows that: (a) given a mechanical system described by a set of indepen-
dent coordinates in conﬁguration space, (b) given an initial state of speciﬁed initial coordinates,
and (c) given a situation in which the system can follow any one of a set of diﬀerent possible paths
with a pertinent probability pi , then the average path (deﬁned as the weighted average positions
and corresponding times) will obey Lagranges’ equations iﬀ the Shannon information deﬁned by
the distribution of probabilities is an extreme (maximum) compared to any imaginable other dis-
tribution. Moreover, the resulting action function is proportional to this Shannon information.

Keywords: Maxent, Least-action principle, Lagrangian Mechanics.

Introduction

Physics is fundamentally divided in two parts. Mechanics, which includes classical, relativistic
and quantum mechanics, is ruled by the least-action principle (LAP) and characterized by laws
invariant by time reversal. Thermodynamics, on the other hand, can be entirely deduced from
the maximum entropy principle (Maxent), and introduces a so-called ”arrow of time”.
LAP is equivalent to Newton’s law in classical mechanics, and can be used in relativistic and
quantum mechanics with an adequate reformulation of the Lagrangian. It has been historically
applied, from Fermat to Feynmann, with such success that today it is a fundamental principle of
physics. It has never been, to our knowledge, deduced from more fundamental principles. On the
other hand, Maxent is justiﬁed by the Bayesian rules of probability, and simply gives the most
probable probability distribution according to given constraints. For instance, in equilibrium ther-
modynamics, Maxent proves that the average values of the extensive quantities used to describe
the system (energy, volume, ...) are appropriate constraints. For an excellent summary of Maxent
properties and their applications to thermodynamics, see [1]. Since Maxent is a principle of logic,
it can and has been successfully applied in many diﬀerent ﬁelds, for example biology, economy or
ecology[2][3].
A mechanical system is deﬁned by the values of a set of generalized coordinates at a given time.
We make the hypothesis that these values, including time, are only known in average. Applying
Maxent, we will logically deduce that the system will follow the Lagrangian laws of motion. LAP
is a consequence of Maxent with appropriate constraints.

In the ﬁrst section, a least information principle will be deduced from Maxent. This section does
not involve physics and is entirely mathematical.
In the second section, the least information principle will be applied to a mechanical system whose
space and time coordinates are only known in average. The least information principle will appear
to be, up to a multiplicative constant with dimension Action, the least action principle.
A third section will be devoted to possible physical interpretations of this result, and to new
questions that then naturally emerge.

1 The least information principle

In this section, a least information principle, similar in form to the least action principle, will be
deduced from Maxent applied with linear constraints. Provided that time is one of the constrained
quantities, the rate of information will satisfy the equations of Cauchy-Riemann.

1.1 The proof

Notations: we write a sequence (si) instead of (s1, s2, ..., simax). Two sequences using the same

name of indice should have the same length. We write

instead of

. A sequence using two

indices is written (si,j) instead of (s1,1, ..., s1,jmax, ..., si,1, ..., si,jmax, ..., simax,1, ..., simax,jmax).

Some numbers (Ak,i) are given once and for all, and will always be considered ﬁxed. Some other
numbers (Ak) are given and we wish to ﬁnd the probability law (pi) satisfying the constraints:

Following Jaynes, we will choose the probability law which maximizes the information:



Using Lagrange multipliers (αk) (see demonstration in Annex 1), we obtain the standard results:

Adding another constraint on a new variable t that the reader can conveniently consider as time,
the system (1) then becomes:

Calling β the Lagrange multiplier of t, the results (2) and (3) become:

By analogy with LAP, this consequence will be subsequently referred as the ”least information
principle”.

If L does not depend explicitly on a given Ak, then the conjugate quantity αk does not vary with
t. If L does not depend explicitly on time t, then the quantity β does not vary with t.

1.3 Degree of validity

Note that in this problem, there are no assumptions about the nature of the (Ak). In particular:
- The (Ak) do not have to be frequency averages of the values (Ak,i) in an experiment. Neither
do we need a notion of ensemble. We want to ﬁnd a probability law which reﬂects our state of
knowledge, not a property of some system.
- The (Ak) do not have to be extensive quantities (a thermodynamical concept not necessary for
Maxent), neither do they need to scale together or have any other relationship.

2 Physical application

Let us consider a mechanical system whose state is deﬁned by a set of independent coordinates
(qk). The motion of such a system can be described by a parameterized curve (qk(λ), t(λ)) in the
((qk), t) space. We call such a curve a path. The system can potentially take many diﬀerent paths
from a given starting position (qk(0), t(0)). Let us denote by (i) the set of all these paths, and
adopt, without loss of generality, a common parameter λ to describe all these paths. A given path
i is then described by the k + 1 functions ((qk,i(λ)), ti(λ)).
We make the hypothesis that the observed path ((qk(λ)), t(λ)) is the average path of all the paths
i, each one occurring with a probability pi. Mathematically:

piqk,i(λ) = qk(λ)

piti(λ) = t(λ)

We now ﬁx the parameter λ, and no longer write the dependence on λ. The Maxent distribution
which satisﬁes the preceding constraints is the solution of system (4), with:

qk,i = Ak,i
qk = Ak

Equations (7), (8), (14) and (15) become:

(17)

We recognize the equations of Lagrangian mechanics: L being the Lagrangian, the (αk) the
generalized momentum, β the opposite of the Hamiltonian and I the action. But this can not
be correct. Because, for instance, the dimension of action is Action = Energy × T ime while I
is dimensionless. However, K being an appropriate constant of dimension Action, we recover all
lagrangian mechanics with the following identiﬁcations:

K I = S
K αk = pk
K β = −H
K L = L

which give

The least information principle becomes the least action principle. The action

is stationary. For any variations δAk(t) such that δAk(t0) = δAk(t1) = 0 for all k, we have δS = 0.

which is Noether’s theorem[6]. The generalized momentum is conserved if L does not explicitly
depend on the associated generaized coordinate. Energy is conserved if L does not explicitly
depend on time.

3 Comments and open questions

The relation between the Lagrangian L and the Hamiltonian H appears naturally in the Maxent
formalism. However, while one is the Legendre transform of the other, they do not play roles
similar to I and ln(Z). In fact, the partition function Z does not play any particular role in our
description (the properties of ln(Z) mirror the properties of I[1]), and it is the presence of time
which induces the relation between L and H.
One can also note that, fundamentally, L satisﬁes the equations of Cauchy-Riemann because dI
is an exact diﬀerential.

In the case of conservative forces, LAP is equivalent to Newton’s law. This means that Laplace’s
equations could have emerge without any hint of Newton, if the work of Jaynes (1922-1998) had
been known. Maxent as a fundamental physical principle certainly has epistemological implica-
tions.

For a given physical path, there is a constant K with dimension Action such that

K I = S
K αk = pk
K β = −H
K L = L

action
generalized momentum
− Hamiltonian
Lagrangian

But nothing a priori prevents the value of K to be diﬀerent in diﬀerent experiments. One can
not calculate the values of I and of the (αk) for a given physical path, since the (qk,i) are a priori
unknown.
However, the (qk,i) could eventually be known using quantum mechanics (QM). To simplify, let us
state that there is one single coordinate x. In QM, a system is deﬁned by its wave function, which
is a function of space and time ϕ(x, t). We can identify a path i of probability pi with the set of
all (x, t) such that |ϕ(x, t)|2 = pi (of course, to be rigorous, the discrete set of paths (i) ﬁrst has
to be replaced by a continuous set). Since the paths i are known, the (xi(λ)) and (ti(λ)) are also
known if we can parameterize all these paths with a common parameter λ. Deducing the value of
K rests an open question.

Feynmann’s path integral formulation of QM[4] oﬀers similarities with our description. However,
the two theories also present fundamental diﬀerences.
In particular, Feynmann assigns equal
probabilities to all paths, and does not average the action S, but the quantity eiS/h. A possible
link has to be investigated.

An analogy between mechanics and thermodynamics has already been found[5]. It uses the for-
malism of diﬀerential forms, but the main results can be obtain using Maxent. This analogy
comes fundamentally from the fact that Lagrangian mechanics and equilibrium thermodynamics
can both be described by a set of linear constraints as has been shown in this paper.

4 Conclusion

The least action principle (LAP) is a consequence of Maxent, provided that the constraints concern
the average coordinates and the average time of a mechanical system. The simplicity of the
demonstration and the high degree of generality of Maxent explain why LAP is so general in
mechanics.
This demonstration of LAP sheds a new light on the relationship between thermodynamics and
mechanics.
It oﬀers an opportunity to unify these two branches of physics, with Maxent as a
common basis.

Abstract

In classical mechanics, the Galilean covariance and the principle of relativity are com-
pletely equivalent and hold for all possible dynamical processes. In relativistic physics, on
the contrary, the situation is much more complex: It will be shown that Lorentz covariance
and the principle of relativity are not equivalent. The reason is that the principle of relativ-
ity actually holds only for the equilibrium quantities characterizing the equilibrium state of
dissipative systems. In the light of this fact it will be argued that Lorentz covariance should
not be regarded as a fundamental symmetry of the laws of physics.

Key words: special relativity, space-time, Lorentz covariance, special relativity principle

Introduction

It is a widely accepted view that special relativity—beyond its metaphysical commitment with
respect to what we should regard as “space” and “time” (cf. Szab 2003a,b)—is a principal theory
providing a powerful method for the physics of objects moving at constant velocities. The basic
idea is the following: Consider a physical object at rest in an arbitrary inertial frame K. Assume
we know the relevant physical equations and know the solution of the equations describing the
physical properties of the object in question when it is at rest. All these things are expressed in the
terms of the space and time coordinates x1, x2, x3, t and some other quantities deﬁned in K on the
basis of x1, x2, x3, t. We now inquire as to the same physical properties of the same object when
it is, as a whole, moving at a given constant velocity relative to K. In other words the question is
how these physical properties are modiﬁed when the object is in motion. Now, it follows from the
covariance of the laws of nature relative to Lorentz transformations that the same equations hold
for the primed variables x′
3, t′, . . . deﬁned in the co-moving inertial frame K ′. On the other
hand, since the moving object is at rest in the co-moving reference frame K ′, the same solution
holds for the primed variables. We obtain the solution describing the system moving at constant
velocity by expressing the primed variables through the original x1, x2, x3, t, . . . of K, applying the
Lorentz transformation.

Usually, in this way we solve the problem of the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a moving point charge,
the Lorentz deformation of a rigid body, the loss of phase suﬀered by a moving clock, the dilatation
of the mean life of a cosmic ray µ-meson, etc.

In this paper I would like to show that the situation is much more complex, and that the
solutions thus obtained are not necessarily correct. The reason is, as we will see, that Lorentz co-
variance in itself does not guarantee that the physical laws in question satisfy the special relativity
principle.

Empirical deﬁnitions of space and time coordinates

In order to elaborate a precise language for our further considerations, recall how space and time
coordinates are operationally deﬁned in special relativity. Denote K the reference frame in which
the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Paris is at rest, together with the
etalons (the standard measuring rod, the standard clock, etc.), and let K ′ be a frame moving with
constant velocity v relative to K. We are interested in the operational reconstruction of the space
and time coordinates deﬁned in both frames K and K ′—according to special relativity. For the
sake of simplicity consider only one space dimension and assume that the origin of both K and
K ′ is at the BIPM at the initial moment of time.

(D1) Time coordinate in K according to special relativity

Take a synchronized copy of the standard clock at rest in the BIPM, and slowly move
it to the locus of event A. The time tag t (A) is the reading of the transfered clock
when A occurs.1

(D2) Space coordinates in K according to special relativity

The space tag x(A) is the distance between the origin of K and the locus of A along
the x-axis,2 measured by superposing the standard measuring-rod, such that the rod
is always at rest relative to K.

(D3) Time coordinate in K ′ according to special relativity

Take a synchronized copy of the standard clock at rest in the BIPM, gently accelerate
it from K to K ′ and set it to show 0 when the origins of K and K ′ coincide. Then
slowly (relative to K ′) move it to the locus of event A. The time tag t′ (A) is the
reading of the transfered clock when A occurs.

(D4) Space coordinates in K ′ according to special relativity

The space tag x′(A) is the distance between the origin of K ′ and the locus of A along
the x-axis, measured by superposing the standard measuring-rod, such that the rod is
always at rest relative to K ′, in just the same way as if all were at rest.

down by factor

Now, from the perpendicular Doppler eﬀect we know that the standard clock (atomic clock) slows
v2
c2 when it is gently accelerated from K to K ′ (Jnossy 1971, p. 37). From the
v2
Michaelson–Morley experiment we know that a rigid rod suﬀers a contraction by factor
c2
when it is gently accelerated from K to K ′. Taking into account these eﬀects, one can directly
calculate the coordinates x′(A) and t′(A), following deﬁnitions (D3)–(D4). First, let us calculate
the reading of the clock slowly transported in K ′ from the origin to the locus of an event A. The
clock is moving with a varying velocity3

−

vC (t) = v + w(t)

where w(t) is the velocity of the clock relative to K ′, that is, w(0) = 0 when it starts at xC (0) = 0
(as we assumed, t = 0 and the transported clock shows 0 when the origins of K and K ′ coincide)

1With this deﬁnition we actually use the standard “ε =

1
2 -synchronization”. I do not want to enter now into
the question of the conventionality of simultaneity, which is a hotly discussed separate problem. (See Reichenbach
1956; Grnbaum 1974; Salmon 1977; Malament 1977; Friedman 1983.)

2The straight line is deﬁned by a light beam.
3For the sake of simplicity we continue to restrict our calculation to the case of one space dimension. For the

general calculation of the phase shift suﬀered by moving clocks, see Jnossy 1971, pp. 142–147.

will be

The special relativity principle

Before entering on the discussion of Einstein’s special relativity principle, it is worth while to
recall how the Galilean relativity principle works. Consider a system consisting of two point
masses connected with a spring (Fig. 1). The equations of motion in K,

Due to this Galilean covariance of (9)–(10), from any solution of the original equations one can
construct a new solution by putting primes on all the variables and then eliminating these primes
by means of (11)–(12). Beyond the mathematical beauty, such a symmetry in itself were not of
signiﬁcance for physics. But, transformation (11)–(12) has two important features. One is the
meaning of the new solution thus obtained, the other is the meaning of the primed variables.

The meaning of x′ and t′ is obvious from (7)–(8): they are the space and time tags measured in
K ′ with the co-moving meter stick and standard clock, if there are no distortions of the measuring
equipments.

Consider an arbitrary solution of the (9)–(10) belonging to the initial condition

It follows from the symmetry that equations (13)–(14) have a solution of the same form in the
primed variables, satisfying

Eliminating the primed variables by means of (11)–(12) we ﬁnd

(15)

(16)

(17)

The motion of the system determined by initial condition (17) is a superposition of the original
motion determined by the original initial condition (15) and a collective translation at velocity v.
That is, the system in question is identical with the original one, but co-moving with the frame
K ′. In other words, the system satisﬁes what we call (special or restricted)
Relativity Principle:
The behaviour of the moving system, expressed in terms of the results of measurements obtainable
by means of measuring-rods and clocks co-moving with K ′ is the same as the behaviour of the
original system, expressed in terms of the measurements with the equipments at rest in K. Exactly
as Galilei describes it:

... the butterﬂies and ﬂies will continue their ﬂights indiﬀerently toward every side,
nor will it ever happen that they are concentrated toward the stern, as if tired out
from keeping up with the course of the ship, from which they will have been separated
during long intervals by keeping themselves in the air. And if smoke is made by burning
some incense, it will be seen going up in the form of a little cloud, remaining still and
moving no more toward one side than the other. The cause of all these correspondences
of eﬀects is the fact that the ship’s motion is common to all the things contained in it
[my italics], and to the air also. (Galilei 1953, p. 187)

Or, in Einstein’s formulation:

If, relative to K, K ′ is a uniformly moving co-ordinate system devoid of rotation, then
natural phenomena run their course with respect to K ′ according to exactly the same
general laws as with respect to K. (Einstein 1920, p. 16)

As we have seen, in classical mechanics the Galilean covariance of the equations describing the
system guarantees the satisfaction of the principle of relativity.

In special relativity Galilean covariance is replaced by Lorentz covariance:

According to the special relativity principle the laws of Nature must be covariant
relative to Lorentz transformations. (Einstein 1979, p. 54)

Consider a set of (diﬀerential) equations expressing some laws of physics, in the terms of variables
x1, x2, x3, t, . . .. Lorentz covariance means that when the equations are expressed in terms of the
variables

they have exactly the same form as before. With the same reasoning as in the case of Galilean
p
covariance, from any solution of the original equations one can construct a new solution by putting
primes on all the variables and then eliminating these primes by means of (18). Again, beyond
the mathematical usefulness of such a symmetry—in generating new solutions—the physical im-
portance of Lorentz covariance consists in the meaning of the primed variables and the meaning
of the new solution thus obtained.

The meaning of x′

3, t′ in (18) is clear from (5) and (6): they are the space and time
tags measured in K ′ with the co-moving meter stick and standard clock, taking into account the
distortions of these measuring equipments when they are moved from K to K ′.4

1, x′

2, x′

Now let us turn to the meaning of the new solution we can obtain from the Lorentz covariance.
It is a widespread conviction that such a new solution, as in the case of Galilean covariance,
describes a system identical with the original one, but co-moving with the frame K ′, and that the
behaviour of the moving system, expressed in terms of the results of measurements obtainable by
means of measuring-rods and clocks co-moving with K ′ is, due to Lorentz covariance, the same as
the behaviour of the original system, expressed in terms of the measurements with the equipments
at rest in K—in accordance with the principle of relativity. Einstein shows the following example:

Let there be given a stationary rigid rod; and let its length be l as measured by a
measuring-rod which is also stationary. We now imagine the axis of the rod lying
along the axis of x of the stationary system of co-ordinates, and that a uniform motion
of parallel translation with velocity v along the axis of x in the direction of increasing
x is then imparted to the rod. We now inquire as to the length of the moving rod, and
imagine its length to be ascertained by the following two operations:

(a) The observer moves together with the given measuring-rod and the rod to be mea-
sured, and measures the length of the rod directly by superposing the measuring-
rod, in just the same way as if all three were at rest.

4The dots in (18) stand for some possible other variables based on the space and time tags. See, for example,

(24).

(b) ...

In accordance with the principle of relativity the length to be discovered by the oper-
ation (a)–we will call it “the length of the rod in the moving system”’–must be equal
to the length l of the stationary rod. (Einstein 1905)

Contrary to this common view, the situation is much more complex. Consider the system of n

performing a collective motion at the uniform velocity (0, 0, v).

It can be easily veriﬁed that in the particular case of n = 1, when the system consists of one
single charged particle, the original equilibrium solution corresponds to the Coulomb ﬁeld of a
point charge at rest, and the new solution obtained through the above Lorentz transformation
method is the well known electromagnetic ﬁeld of a point charge moving at constant velocity.

Let us illustrate how the well known phenomena of the Lorentz contraction and the time
dilatation work out. Consider two equilibrium particles, say the α -th and the β-th. Their original
distance in the direction of the motion was

Thus the elapsed time between two episodes of the life of the system in motion is longer than the
elapsed time between the same episodes in the system at rest.

Thus, in this particular case, the system described by the new solution we obtained from the
Lorentz covariance of the original equations, is leastwise very similar to the original system when it
moves, as a whole, at velocity v, and the usual relativistic phenomena like the Lorentz contraction
and the time dilatation seem to be reconstructed. This is, however, an illusion. The solution
belonging to the initial condition (35)–(36) is not a simple superposition of the original motion of
the system and a collective translation at velocity v—as it was the case in (17). For (38) describes
the motion of the particles only for t > t⋆
∈ I1). Before that time there is a deformation
α
of the system, since the particles start their motions at diﬀerent moments of time from various
places. The truth is that there are many diﬀerent initial conditions and many corresponding
solutions which could be, intuitively, regarded as “like the original system when it is moving as a
whole” and the Lorentz covariance does not guarantee that the one we obtained is the right one.
As the next two examples will show, the situation can be even more complex.

This system is identical with the original one but in a collective motion at velocity v. However, it
is totally diﬀerent from the system corresponding to the solution (38). (No Lorentz contraction,
for example).

Example 3. On the other hand, consider the general case:

Then, there exists a solution of equations (25)–(28) with the same initial conditions,

Consider a rod at rest in K. The length of the rod is l. At a given moment of time t0 we take a

Then, forget this system, and imagine another one which is initiated at moment t = t0 with the
initial condition (51)–(52). No doubt, the new system will be identical with a rod of length l,
continuing to be at rest in K.

instead of (51)–(52). No doubt, in a very short interval of time (t0, t0 + ∆t) this system is a rod
of length l, moving at velocity v; the motion of each particle is a superposition of its original
motion, according to (51)–(52), and the collective translation at velocity (0, 0, v). In other words,
it is a rod co-moving with the reference frame K ′. Still, its length is l, contrary to the principle of

relativity, according to which the rod should be of length l
The resolution of this “contradiction” is that the system initiated in state (53)–(54) at time t0
ﬁnds itself in a non-equilibrium state. Therefore, due to certain dissipations, it relaxes to the
equilibrium state. As we have seen from the above examples, the Lorentz covariance does not
guarantee, that the equilibrium state in question is identical with the one belonging to (48)–(50).
What such a new equilibrium state is like, depends on the details of the dissipation/relaxation
process in question. It is basically a thermodynamical question.

One can easily follow how this relaxation goes on in the case of one single point charge accel-
erated from K to K ′ (see Jnossy 1971, pp. 208-210). Suppose the particle is at rest for t < 0,
the acceleration starts at t = 0 and the particle moves with constant velocity v for t
t0. Using
the retarded potentials (19)–(21) we can calculate the ﬁeld of the moving particle at some time
t > t0. We ﬁnd three zones in the ﬁeld (see Fig. 2). In Region I, surrounding the particle, we ﬁnd
the “Lorentz-transformed Coulomb ﬁeld” of the point charge moving at constant velocity—the
solution we usually ﬁnd in the textbooks. In Region II, surrounding Region I, we ﬁnd a radiation
ﬁeld travelling outward which was emitted by the particle in the period 0 < t < t0 of acceleration.
Finally, outside Region II, the ﬁeld is produced by the particle at times t < 0. The ﬁeld in Region
III is therefore the Coulomb ﬁeld of the charge at rest. Thus, the principle of relativity does never

exactly hold. Although, Region I where “the principle holds” is blowing up with the speed of light.
In this way the whole conﬁguration is relaxing to the solution which follows from the principle of
relativity.

From these examples we can draw the conclusion that whether or not the Lorentz covariance of
the physical equations implies the satisfaction of the principle of relativity depends on the details
of the dissipation/relaxation process in question. How to explain then that in many textbook
examples, applying the principle of relativity, we obtain the correct results—conﬁrmed by the
experimental ﬁndings? The answer is very simple: it is a typical feature of a dissipative system that
it unlearns the initial conditions; some of the properties of the system in equilibrium state, after
the relaxation, are independent from the initial conditions. The limiting (t
) electromagnetic
ﬁeld of the moving charge and the equilibrium length of a solid rod are good examples. These
equilibrium properties are completely determined by the equations themselves independently of the
initial conditions. If so, the Lorentz covariance of the equations in itself guarantees the satisfaction
of the principle of relativity with respect to these properties: Let X be the value of such a physical
quantity—characterizing the equilibrium state of the system in question, fully determined by the
equations independently of the initial conditions—ascertained by the equipments at rest in K.
Let X ′ be the value of the same quantity of the same system when it is in equilibrium and at rest
relative to the moving reference frame K ′, ascertained by the measuring equipments co-moving
with K ′. If the equations are Lorentz covariant then X = X ′. Whenever we derive correct results
by applying the principle of relativity, we apply it for such particular equilibrium quantities.

4. The principle of relativity is not a general principle. It holds only for the equilibrium quanti-
ties characterizing the equilibrium state of dissipative systems. Since dissipation, relaxation
and equilibrium are thermodynamical conceptions par excellence, the special relativistic prin-
ciple of relativity is actually a thermodynamical principle, rather than a general principle
satisﬁed by all dynamical laws of physics describing all physical processes in details. One has
to recognize that the special relativistic principle of relativity is experimentally conﬁrmed
only in such restricted sense.

5. The satisfaction of the principle of relativity in such restricted sense is guaranteed by the
Lorentz covariance of those physical equations that determine, independently of the initial
conditions, the equilibrium quantities for which the principle of relativity holds.

6. Another consequence of the fact that the principle of relativity holds only in such a restricted
sense is that Lorentz covariance is a suﬃcient but not a necessary condition for (the restricted
sense) principle of relativity. Consequently, from the experimental ﬁndings conﬁrming the
principle of relativity, one cannot infer to the Lorentz covariance of the laws of physics.
Beyond the fact that some of the experimentally conﬁrmed theories are ab ovo Lorentz
covariant, nothing experimentally necessitates the hypothesis that all laws of physics must
be Lorentz covariant. Lorentz covariance is not a fundamental symmetry of physics.

7. The space and time tags obtainable by means of measuring-rods and clocks co-moving with
diﬀerent inertial reference frames can be connected through the Lorentz transformation. As

11

we have seen, this fact can be derived independently of the Lorentz covariance of the laws
of physics and of the principle of relativity, in general. Although it is compatible with the
general observation that the principle of relativity holds for such equilibrium quantities as
the length of a rigid body or the characteristic periods of a clock-like system.

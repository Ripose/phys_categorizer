Abstract In the ﬁrst sections of this article, we discuss two vari-
ations on Maxwell’s equations that have been introduced in ear-
lier work—a class of nonlinear Maxwell theories with well-deﬁned
Galilean limits (and correspondingly generalized Yang-Mills equa-
tions), and a linear modiﬁcation motivated by the coupling of the
electromagnetic potential with a certain nonlinear Schr¨odinger
equation. In the ﬁnal section, revisiting an old idea of Lorentz,
we write Maxwell’s equations for a theory in which the electro-
static force of repulsion between like charges diﬀers fundamentally
in magnitude from the electrostatic force of attraction between
unlike charges. We elaborate on Lorentz’ description by means
of electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths, whose governing equa-
tions separate into two fully relativistic Maxwell systems—one
describing ordinary electromagnetism, and the other describing
a universally attractive or repulsive long-range force. If such a
force cannot be ruled out a priori by known physical principles,
its magnitude should be determined or bounded experimentally.
Were it to exist, interesting possibilities go beyond Lorentz’ early
conjecture of a relation to (Newtonian) gravity.

It is a pleasure to dedicate this paper to G´erard Emch, whose skeptical per-
spective helps motivate those who know him to the pursuit of deeper scientiﬁc
understandings.

1. Introduction

Maxwell’s equations are among the most beautiful in physics, unifying the
forces of electricity and magnetism in a classical ﬁeld theory that explains
electromagnetic waves [1]. Some well-known, profoundly-motivated varia-
tions on Maxwell’s equations have included the Born-Infeld theory (a non-
linear but Lorentz-covariant modiﬁcation, that introduces an eﬀective upper
bound to the electric ﬁeld strength), and the Yang-Mills equations (introduc-
ing non-Abelian gauge potentials) [2, 3]. These ideas go back many decades,
and have deeply inﬂuenced the development of theoretical physics. Indeed,
there has been a recent resurgence of interest in non-Abelian Born-Infeld
Lagrangians [4], which turn out to have important application in string the-
ory and related subjects [5, 6, 7, 8]. More recently, variations of Maxwell’s
equations have been considered as ”test theories,” with respect to which ob-
servations in astrophysics can provide upper bounds to deviations from the
usual equations or laws of physics [9, 10]. We nevertheless seek to approach
the idea of modifying Maxwell’s equations in new ways with appropriate hu-
mility. None of the variations considered in this article is ad hoc. Rather,
each occurred in answer to a speciﬁc question in fundamental physics.

→ ∞

Sections 2 and 3 review two such modiﬁcations considered by the sec-
ond author in recent years. The ﬁrst of these, proposed in joint work with
Vladimir Shtelen [11, 12], is a class of Galilean nonlinear Maxwell theories,
together with non-Abelian versions that generalize the Yang-Mills equations
and the non-Abelian Born-Infeld equations. These possibilities arise in an-
swer to the question of whether and how Maxwell’s equations for the four
ﬁelds E , B , D and H can survive unchanged in the Galilean limit of
c
, a feature that is present in neither the usual, linear Maxwell theory,
nor the usual Born-Infeld theory. The second variation is a simple, linear
modiﬁcation, that can be associated with a change over time in some “con-
stants” of electromagnetism. This possibility comes up in answer to the
question of how to write gauge-invariant expressions for the electromagnetic
ﬁeld strengths E and B , when Maxwell’s equations are coupled with a
natural and very general family of nonlinear Schr¨odinger time-evolutions in
quantum mechanics [13]. Such a family of nonlinear Schr¨odinger equations
was developed and studied in a series of articles, in joint work with Heinz-
Dietrich Doebner and Peter Nattermann [14, 15, 16]. In the general nonlinear
equation, a certain “frictional” term originally proposed by Kostin [17] is the
one requiring a change in Maxwell’s equations for the ﬁeld strengths, after
nonlinear gauge transformations are taken into account.

2

Finally, in Section 4, we take up a diﬀerent question. In a 1900 article
that seems to be not very well-known today, Lorentz explored the idea that
(Newtonian) gravity could be explained if the electrostatic force of repulsion
between like charges were smaller in absolute magnitude than the electro-
static force of attraction between unlike charges [18]. Setting aside Lorentz’
conjectured relation to gravity, we want to reopen the possibility of a dif-
ference in magnitude between these forces. There is then a straightforward
and elegant description of the situation by means of Maxwell’s equations,
that was partially written down in Lorentz’ original article. Under the given
hypothesis, one may introduce new electric and magnetic ﬁelds whose gov-
erning equations separate into two fully relativistic Maxwell systems—one
describing ordinary electromagnetism, and the other describing an overall
attractive or repulsive long-range force that couples to an “absolute charge.”
While the latter force might conceivably have something to do with gravity,
it is more plausible to regard it as a small, theoretically possible correc-
tion to ordinary electromagnetism. Such a correction could, in principle, be
time-dependent, and serve as a further “test theory” for astrophysical mea-
surements. Whether attractive or repulsive, a modiﬁed electromagnetism
could be important in modeling the early universe. Unless a known physical
principle rules out such a force a priori, its magnitude should be regarded as
an experimental question. Well-known nonlinear and non-Abelian general-
izations of Maxwell’s equations, and their uniﬁcation with weak interactions,
could then equally well be constructed from the new equations, opening up
interesting possibilities.

In the remainder of this section we establish notation, summarize some
elementary, familiar background material, and make a few relevant remarks.
All of our discussions pertain to (3 + 1)-dimensional space-time.
Let us write Maxwell’s equations in SI units, as follows [1]:

E =

∇ ×

∂B
∂t

,

−

B = 0 ,

H =

D = ρ ,

(1)

∇ ·

∇ ×

where E(x, t) is the electric ﬁeld, D(x, t) the electric displacement, B(x, t)
the magnetic induction, and H(x, t) the magnetic ﬁeld; ρ(x, t) is the charge
density, and j (x, t) the electric current density.

The ﬁrst pair of Eqs. (1) imply that we can write E and B in terms of

potentials (Φ, A),

B =

A , E =

The choice of Φ and A is not unique. For an arbitrary smooth function
Θ(x, t), new potentials A′ and Φ ′ that are obtained from the gauge trans-
formation

A′ = A +

Θ , Φ ′ = Φ

give just the same ﬁelds E and B . Thus E and B are said to be gauge
B = 0 expresses the nonexistence in nature of
invariant. The condition
magnetic monopoles, which in this article we do not consider changing. Our
choice of SI units here is motivated by the desire to avoid incorporating the
speed of light c into the deﬁnitions of any of the ﬁelds, as we shall later be
interested in considering the c

limit.
From the second pair of Eqs. (1), there follows immediately the equation

→ ∞

∂ρ
∂t

+

∇ ·

j = 0 ,

expressing conservation of electric charge.

Thus far, the system is underdetermined. To complete Maxwell’s equa-
tions in the presence of matter, one introduces constitutive equations relating
the ﬁelds D, H to the ﬁelds E, B. The usual system of Maxwell equations
in vacuo is obtained using linear constitutive equations,

D = ε0E , H =

B ,

1
µ0

where ε0µ0 = 1/c2. However, we shall shortly be considering a certain class
of nonlinear constitutive equations.

One may take the point of view, given the absence of magnetic monopoles,
that the only physically detectable ﬁelds are E and B. These are deﬁned
operationally via the observed Lorentz force F on a small “test particle”
with electric charge q moving with velocity v:

F = q E + q v

B .

×

The ﬁelds H and D can then be regarded as unobservable constructs used
to describe, by way of the latter two Maxwell equations and the constitutive
equations, how the observable ﬁelds are produced by charges and currents.

As noted in Ref. [11], we then actually have a more general class of linear

constitutive equations,

which—when combined with Eqs. (1)—lead for all values of the real param-
eter λ to the same set of equations for the observable ﬁelds E and B. Thus
the choice λ = 0 resulting in Eqs. (5) is arbitrary.

Also relevant to the forthcoming discussion is the well-known minimal
coupling of the electromagnetic potentials (Φ, A) with Schr¨odinger’s equa-
tion for the (complex-valued) wave function ψ(x, t) of a single quantum-
mechanical particle having charge q,

Local U(1) gauge transformations act on ψ according to the formula,

ψ ′(x, t) = e iθ(x,t)ψ(x, t) ,

(8)

(9)

and it is easily checked that if ψ obeys Eq. (8), then ψ ′ obeys a gauge-
transformed equation of the same form, with new electromagnetic potentials
given by Eqs. (3) in which Θ(x, t) = (¯h/q) θ(x, t) .

The gauge-invariant ﬁelds E and B, which exert the electric and mag-
netic forces on the charged quantum particle, are obtained from Φ and A
using Eqs. (2), and satisfy Eqs. (1). The gauge-invariant probability and
probability ﬂux densities for the particle are given, respectively, by

these also obey an equation of continuity.

Let us remark on the fact that Eqs. (1) respect the Lorentz transfor-
mations of special relativity, while Schr¨odinger’s equation respects Galilean
transformations. The minimal coupling of Eq. (8) is compatible with these
facts because Eqs. (1) also respect Galilean transformations. It is the linear
constitutive equations that impose Lorentz symmetry on the usual Maxwell
equations, breaking the Galilean symmetry (see below).

We reproduce Lorentz transformations here in SI units for completeness.

as Born-Infeld or Euler-Kockel electrodynamics. It is natural in Eqs. (24) to
take M and N to be functions of just the ﬁrst two invariants I1 and I2
(which depend only on E and B ), or in the inverted Eqs. (25) to take R
and Q to be functions of just the invariants I3 and I4 (which depend only
on D and H ).

The usual approach to writing nonlinear Maxwell theories is to begin
with the Lagrangian
, which can be written as a function of the invariants.
The constitutive equations then follow from the Euler-Lagrange equations.
But not all Lorentz-covariant theories are Lagrangian, and the approach via
constitutive equations is more general.

2. Maxwell equations having Galilean limits

When Maxwell’s equations are written for the four ﬁelds E, B, D, and H
as in Eqs. (1), the system is underdetermined. In the SI units we are using,
these equations are independent of the speed of light c. Furthermore, the
corresponding equations for the primed ﬁelds deﬁned by Eqs. (13) and the
primed currents deﬁned by Eqs. (14), when written in the primed coordinates
deﬁned by Eqs. (12), are unchanged from Eqs. (1)—even though the Lorentz
transformations given in Eqs. (12)-(14) are parameterized explicitly by c.
Since the invariance of Eqs. (1) holds for every value of c, we should not be
at all surprised that in the limit c
, these equations also respect the
resulting Galilean transformations,

(30)

Now, the value of c does appear in the constitutive equations. Thus the
choice between Lorentz or Galilei symmetry, or the selection of a particular,
ﬁnite value of c under which the Lorentz symmetry holds, resides entirely in
the constitutive equations.

For the linear constitutive equations (5) or (7), the speed of light is spec-
iﬁed by c = (ε0µ0)−1/2. In this case, taking a Galilean limit requires that
some aspect of Maxwell’s equations be sacriﬁced, as discussed in detail by
Le Bellac and Levy-Leblond [20].

The constitutive equations that select Galilean symmetry, when combined

with Eqs. (1), are

or, equivalently

D = ˆM B, H = ˆNB

ˆM E,

B = ˆRD, E = ˆQD

As discussed in Ref. [20], however, taking the mathematical step of letting
c
is not precisely the same thing as imposing the low velocity condition
v/c << 1 on a class of physical systems governed by the dynamical equations
with Lorentz symmetry. For instance, when E and B are held ﬁxed, the limit
does not allow the “electric limit” of Ref. [20], although v/c << 1 is
c
compatible with it.

Letting ˆM be a constant in Eqs. (28) requires (since

B = 0) that
the charge density ρ
0. Hence the answer to the question of a consis-
tent Galilean electrodynamics, retaining Maxwell’s equations, the continu-
ity equation, and the Lorentz force, is a class of essentially nonlinear the-
ories, that can arise as the c
limit of a class of essentially nonlinear

Lorentz-covariant theories. Indeed, Le Bellac and Levy-LeBlond emphasize
(always assuming linear constitutive equations) the mutual incompatibility
of Galilean invariance, the continuity equation with non-zero values, and
magnetic forces between electric currents.

With nonlinear constitutive equations, these features are no longer in-
compatible. Nontrivial choices of ˆM and ˆN in Eqs. (28), or ˆR and ˆQ in
Eqs.(29), combined with Maxwell’s equations, yield fully consistent Galilean
versions of electrodynamics.

For example, Ref. [11] proposes to set

which are homogeneous functions of the ﬁeld strengths. This can be shown
to lead to an interesting, albeit non-Lagrangian, theory.

Writing the Lagrangian for a nonlinear relativistic theory as

tions that

Similarly, generalizations of classical (non-Abelian) Yang-Mills theory
are written by means of Lorentz-covariant, nonlinear constitutive equations.
Again, with appropriate choices for the dynamics, the new systems can have
fully consistent Galilean-covariant limits as c
. In analogy with Eqs.
(37)-(38), one obtains a class of generalizations of non-Abelian Born-Infeld
theories that are of this type [12].

3. Modiﬁcation from a nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation

Another variation on Maxwell’s equations occurs as a result of considering
the coupling of external electromagnetic ﬁelds with nonlinear Schr¨odinger
time-evolutions [13, 16]. First we write the class of Schr¨odinger equations
under consideration. Refs.
[14] and [15] provide extensive motivation and
development, that we omit here; we mainly follow the discussion in Ref. [13].
Letting ψ(x, t) be the quantum-mechanical wave function, and deﬁne

expression we called ρ gi in the ﬁrst of Eqs. (10).

The motivation for the form adopted in writing Eq. (42), for the pres-
ence of the terms with α1 , α2 and
= 0, and the time-dependence of the
A1 6
coeﬃcients, is the possibility of introducing a group of nonlinear gauge trans-
formations that leave this family of equations invariant (as a class). With
ψ = R exp [ iS ], these take the form ψ

ψ ′ = R ′ exp [ iS ′ ], with

7→

R ′ = R , S ′ = ΛS + γ ln R + θ ;

(45)

where γ and Λ are continuously diﬀerentiable, real-valued functions of t ,
= 0, and θ is a continuously diﬀerentiable, real-valued function of x and
Λ
t. Then nonlinear gauge transformations obey the group law,

(Λ1, γ1, θ1) (Λ2, γ2, θ2) = (Λ1Λ2, γ1 + Λ1γ2, θ1 + Λ1θ2) .

(46)

With quantum-mechanical measurements characterized as sequences of po-
sitional measurements (at distinct times), together with the application of
external ﬁelds between positional measurements [21, 22], and maintaining
2 as a probability density for the
the standard interpretation of ˆρ =
|
outcomes of positional measurements, such transformations then leave the
distribution of outcomes of all measurements invariant. They are also local
in space-time, and respect a separation condition for multiparticle product
wave functions [16, 23]. Notice that with γ
1 , we recover the
usual local U(1) gauge group of electromagnetism (acting linearly on ψ) as
a subgroup of the larger group of nonlinear gauge transformations.

so that ˆρ (as desired) is gauge-invariant (for nonlinear as well as linear
gauge transformations). Thus we shall also write ˆρ = ρ gi when we want
to emphasize this. But ˆj is not gauge-invariant—one must write a new
gauge-invariant current (see below), to fully generalize Eqs. (10). Moreover,
if ψ satisﬁes Eq. (42) then ψ ′ likewise satisﬁes an equation of this form,
but with new (primed) coeﬃcients and new external ﬁelds. The coeﬃcients
transformed under (γ, Λ, θ) are given by

Observe that even if one begins with α1 = α2 = 0 and with time-independent
coeﬃcients νj and µj , the fact that γ and Λ can be time-dependent requires
that in Eq. (42) the αj be permitted to take nonzero values, and that all
the νj, µj , and αj be, in general, time-dependent. However, the nonlinear
gauge transformations do not mix the coeﬃcients αj with the coeﬃcients
νj and µj .

The nonlinear term with coeﬃcient α1 was ﬁrst proposed as a modiﬁ-
cation of linear quantum mechanics by Bialynicki-Birula and Micielski [24],
and the term with coeﬃcient α2 was proposed still earlier by Kostin [17].
The term with coeﬃcient ν2 6
= 0 was derived by Doebner and Goldin from
considerations of local current algebra representations [14], which led to the
generalized equation containing the nonlinear functionals Rj

[15].

Next let us write the equations of motion described by this class of non-
linear Schr¨odinger equations entirely in terms of gauge-invariant quantities,
as in Ref. [13]—where “gauge invariance” is interpreted with respect to the
group of nonlinear gauge transformations. To start, a gauge-invariant cur-

Continuing to follow Ref. [13], we are now in a position to write equations
of motion obtained from Eq. (42), in a form that is manifestly gauge-invariant
for the group of nonlinear gauge transformations. We use the hydrodynamical
variables variables ρ gi and Jgi/ρ gi , where the latter has the interpretation
of a gauge-invariant velocity ﬁeld. We then have the interpretation of the
(gauge-invariant) magnetic induction as a vorticity ﬁeld,

as a gauge-invariant coeﬃcient of friction—it governs the magnitude of the
term in ∂t (Jgi/ρ gi) that is proportional to Jgi/ρ gi.

In the framework of the nonlinear quantum mechanics discussed here, the
(gauge-invariant) expected values for the position, velocity, and acceleration
of the quantum particle (all of which are functions of t) are given respectively
by the following expressions:

(cid:19)

In Eqs. (58)-(59), we see that the laws of force describing the interaction of
the charged particle with the E and B ﬁelds are unchanged from those in
linear quantum mechanics.

Now Eq. (54) gives us the variation on Maxwell’s equations that is the

focus of this section. The usual equations for E and B are replaced by

E =

∇ ×

∂ B
∂t −

−

β2 B ,

B = 0 .

∇ ·

(60)

Note that the second of these equations is still consistent with the ﬁrst. Let
us take β2 to be a constant, independent of t . If E0(x, t) , B0(x, t) satisfy
the original Maxwell equations (with β2 = 0), then ﬁelds satisfying Eqs. (60)
are given by

E = E0 e −β2t, B = B0 e −β2t.

(61)

But nonlinear quantum mechanics alone does not specify the remaining two
Maxwell equations. One possibility is to maintain the constitutive equations
(5), with ﬁxed coeﬃcients ε0 and µ0 . Then taking E0 , B0 , D0 = ε0E0 ,
H0 = (1/µ0)B0, ρ 0 and j 0 to satisfy the usual, linear Maxwell equations
(1), we must have

D = D0 e −β2t, H = H0 e −β2t ,

(62)

17

and

D = ρ , with ρ = ρ 0 e −β2t ,

∇ ·

H =

∇ ×

∂D
∂t

+ β2 D + j , with j = j 0 e −β2t .

(63)

That is, with β2 > 0 , the magnitudes of all the electric charges and currents
are decaying exponentially with time. Of course, the equation of continuity
for ρ and j no longer holds, and net charge is no longer conserved. Instead,
we have the equation

∂ρ
∂t

=

j

β2ρ .

−∇ ·
The nonzero value for β2 , interpreted as a coeﬃcient of friction experienced
by a charged particle, has introduced a preferred universal reference frame.
The corresponding Maxwell theory is no longer covariant.

−

Another alternative is to join the standard Maxwell equations for D
and H with Eqs. (60) by supposing that the coeﬃcients in the constitu-
tive equations—the permittivity and permeability of free space—are time-
dependent. With

ε(t) = ε0 e +β2t , µ(t) = µ0 e −β2t ,

we may combine Eqs. (60) and (61) with the constitutive equations,

(64)

(65)

(66)

D = ε(t)E , H =

1
µ(t)

B .

Then D = D0 , H = H0 , ρ = ρ0 , and j = j 0 . We have ε(t)µ(t) = 1/c2
for all t . The equation of continuity holds for ρ and j , and the net charge
is conserved.

Since current systems of units deﬁne the vacuum permittivity to have
a ﬁxed numerical value, the modiﬁcation embodied in Eqs. (66) requires
some reexamination of the way in which we deﬁne our units of measurement
for electromagnetism. We shall return brieﬂy to the idea of time-dependent
permittivity and permeability toward the end of the next section.

4. Force diﬀerences between like and unlike charges

For our ﬁnal variation on Maxwell’s equations, we pursue the suggestion
by Lorentz that the electrostatic force of repulsion between like charges is

18

slightly diﬀerent in magnitude from the electrostatic force of attraction be-
tween unlike charges. While Lorentz proposed this idea in 1900 as a way to
arrive at a universally attractive (Newtonian) gravitational force, we want
to regard it here as just a modiﬁcation of classical electrodynamics. Let us
write a description of the situation in terms of ﬁeld strengths.

The electrostatic forces among pairs of positively-charged point particles
having charges Q+ > 0 and q+ > 0 and/or negatively-charged point parti-
cles Q− < 0 and q− < 0 , is described by

Introduce the electric ﬁeld E+ exerting force on positive charges, and the
electric ﬁeld E− exerting force on negative charges; also the displacement
ﬁelds D+ and D− produced (respectively) by positive and negative charges.
In ordinary electromagnetism, E = E+ = E− , while D = D+ + D− .
Evidently we must keep track separately of the density ρ+ ≥
0 of positive
charge and the density ρ− ≤
0 of negative charge. From Eqs. (67), the
force F+ experienced by the positively charged particle with charge q+ in
the presence of a composite having charges Q+ and Q− at a distance r is
given by

In his original article [18], Lorentz took the new force to be attractive.
He sought to identify the absolute charge with mass (and consequently the
absolute current with momentum), and to calculate whether the precession
of the perihelion of Mercury’s orbit could then be understood as due to the
(very small) magnetic force that would originate from the absolute current.
He concluded that the resulting force would be too weak to explain the
astronomical observations, and of course this line of thinking was superseded
by the success of Einstein’s general relativity.

However, we want to entertain the idea of a modiﬁed electrodynamics
that does not identify the extra ﬁelds with gravity, and that treats absolute
charge not as mass but as an additional property of matter. Of course, this
does not preclude the possibility that existing measurements of gravitational
forces have erroneously incorporated an extra electrostatic force (attractive
or repulsive). It would seem to be an especially interesting conjecture that
In any case, we appear to have an additional

parameter with which to ﬁt cosmological models, and an additional “test
theory” for study through observations in astrophysics.

Furthermore, one may conjecture that physical “constants” are not ac-
tually constant, but change as the universe ages. We discussed in Sec. 3
the possibility of the vacuum permittivity and permeability changing ex-
ponentially with t , producing a modiﬁcation in Maxwell’s equations and a

22

universal frictional force that breaks covariance. One may instead take these
to be ﬁxed at ε0 and µ0 , but entertain the possibility that εu and εℓ are
changing, and that they have not always been as close as they are today. For
example, we could have

˜ε(t) = ˜ε0 e +βt ,

˜µ(t) = ˜µ0 e −βt ,

Now the absolute charge of a system must be at least equal to the net
charge, and at least equal to the sum of the absolute charges of the system’s
e
components. However, it could in principle be greater. The absolute charge
of a proton, for example, might be the sum of the absolute values of the
charges of its constituent quarks; but one could also conjecture additional,
unobserved positive and negative charges in equal measure, contributing to
a larger value of the overall absolute charge.

It also appears that, unlike the situation for net charge, it would be pos-
sible to have a coherent superposition of quantum states having diﬀerent
absolute charges; for example, the neutral pion, written as a linear combina-
¯dd)/√2 , would combine
tion of up and down quark-antiquark pairs, (¯uu
states of absolute charges 4/3 and 2/3 (in units of the electron’s charge).
While net charge is quantized in ﬁxed units, it is plausible but not necessary
that absolute charge be similarly quantized.

−

Since we have a new set of ﬁelds obeying Maxwell’s equations, we would
also need to have a new type of electromagnetic wave (coupling weakly with
the absolute charge), and a new type of photon.

While net charge is conserved, and absolute charge seems to be conserved
in processes that do not involve particle creation or annihilation, it does not
appear that absolute charge is conserved by fundamental particle processes.
As long as we stay with Lorentz’ idea that absolute charge is proportional to
mass, then (as mass is transformed into energy during such processes) we still
have a conservation law. But if we take absolute charge to be an independent
quantity with which the new electromagnetic ﬁelds couple, one possibility is
to postulate something previously unknown into which absolute charge can
transform during annihilation processes, so as to maintain a conservation law.
More likely, the new U(1) gauge symmetry is broken outside the classical
domain that is governed by Maxwell’s equations.

If Lorentz’ conjecture breaks no known physical principle, then the ques-
tion of a discrepancy in magnitude between the electrostatic forces between

23

like and unlike charges is purely an empirical one, and the best we can do in
principle is to establish an experimental upper bound to this discrepancy (or,
equivalently, to the ratio ε0/
ε . For example, it is clear that this conjecture
continues to respect the charge conjugation invariance of electromagnetism.
However, it should be noted that current physics tends to assume the equal-
ity in magnitude between these forces. Thus the present, oﬃcial deﬁnition
of the coulomb is eﬀectively as a unit of net charge, while the value of ε0
is not measured but ﬁxed by deﬁnition. Just as we have come to distin-
guish (theoretically) gravitational mass from inertial mass, and to regard
their proportionality as a question to be determined by experiment, so may
it be necessary to distinguish (theoretically) εℓ from εu , and to regard their
closeness as having a value to be bounded by experiment.

e

Possible further development of a “doubled electromagnetism” theory
could entail its involvement in electroweak uniﬁcation or in the standard
model, its nonlinear modiﬁcations (as discussed for Maxwell’s equations in
Sec. 2 of this article), its coupling with linear and nonlinear Schr¨odinger
quantum mechanics (as discussed for Maxwell ﬁelds in Sec. 3 of this article),
and its non-Abelian generalizations.

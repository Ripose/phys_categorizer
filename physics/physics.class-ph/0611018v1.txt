It is shown that a given non-autonomous system of two ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential equa-

tions can be expressed in Hamiltonian form. The derivation presented here allow us to obtain

previously known results such as the inﬁnite number of Hamiltonians in the autonomous case

and the Helmholtz condition for the existence of a Lagrangian.

1. Introduction

As is well known, it is very convenient to express a given system of ordinary diﬀerential equations

(not necessarily related to classical mechanics) as the Euler–Lagrange equations associated with

some Lagrangian, L, or as the Hamilton equations associated with some Hamiltonian, H (see,

e.g., Ref. 1). One of the advantages of such identiﬁcations is the possibility of ﬁnding constants

of motion, which are related to symmetries of L or H. Also, the Hamiltonian of a classical

system is usually regarded as an essential element to ﬁnd a quantum version of the mechanical

system.

In the simple case of a mechanical system with forces derivable from a potential (that may

depend on the velocities), there is a straightforward procedure to ﬁnd a Lagrangian or a Hamil-

tonian. However, in the case of non-conservative mechanical systems or of systems not related

to mechanics, the problem of ﬁnding a Lagrangian or a Hamiltonian is more involved. A given

system of n second-order ordinary diﬀerential equations are equivalent to the Euler–Lagrange

equations for some Lagrangian if and only if a set of conditions (known as the Helmholtz con-

ditions) are fulﬁlled (see, e.g., Refs. 2, 3 and the references cited therein).

The aim of this paper is to give a straightforward procedure to ﬁnd a Hamiltonian for a

given system of two ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential equations (which may not be equivalent to a

second-order ordinary diﬀerential equation) that possibly involves the time in an explicit form.

The results derived here contain the Helmholtz condition for n = 1 (in the case where the given

system is equivalent to a second-order equation). In Sec. 2 the main results of this paper are

established, demonstrating that a given system of ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential equations can

be expressed in Hamiltonian form looking for an integrating factor of a diﬀerential form made

out of the functions contained in the system and, in Sec. 3, several examples are presented. In

Sec. 4 we show that, in the appropriate case, our results lead to the Helmholtz condition for the

existence of a Lagrangian.

2. Hamiltonians and canonical variables

We shall consider a system of ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential equations of the form

˙x = f (x, y, t),

˙y = g(x, y, t),

(1)

2

where f and g are two given functions. A system of this class can be obtained from a second-order

equation

to the system (1).

¨x = F (x, ˙x, t),

by introducing the variable y = ˙x. We are initially interested in ﬁnding a Hamiltonian function,

H, and canonical variables, q, p, such that the corresponding Hamilton’s equations be equivalent

Assuming that there is an invertible relation between the variables x, y and a set of canonical

coordinates q, p, x = x(q, p, t), y = y(q, p, t), in such a way that Eqs. (1) are equivalent to the

Hamilton equations for q and p with a Hamiltonian H, making use of the chain rule, one ﬁnds

− gdx + f dy =

∂(x, y)
∂(q, p)

dH − ∂y
∂t

∂x
∂t

dy + terms proportional to dt.

(2)

Therefore, given the system (1) we start by considering the diﬀerential form

− (g − φ)dx + (f − ψ)dy,

(3)

φ(q, p, t) ≡ ∂y(q, p, t)

,

ψ(q, p, t) ≡ ∂x(q, p, t)

∂t

∂t

are functions unspeciﬁed by now (see Eq. (10) below). For a ﬁxed value of t, the diﬀerential

form (3) is always integrable (see any standard text on ordinary diﬀerential equations, e.g., Ref.

4); that is, there exist (locally) functions σ and H, which may depend parametrically on t, such

− (g − φ)dx + (f − ψ)dy = σdH.

(4)

Now, for simplicity, without any loss of generality (since, once we have found a set of canonical

coordinates, we have the liberty of making any canonical transformation afterwards), we choose
q ≡ x (hence, ψ = 0) and, therefore,

Then, by comparing Eqs. (2) and (4), the canonical momentum, p, must be such that

(Note the cancelation of φ.)

Equation (14) shows that the function σ is determined up to a factor that is a constant of

motion and, therefore, there exists an inﬁnite number of Hamiltonians (and, correspondingly, of

expressions for p). It may be noticed that Eq. (14) is just Liouville’s theorem.

3. Examples

A ﬁrst example is provided by the equation

¨x + γ ˙x + ω

2
0x = η(t),

where γ and ω0 are constants, and η(t) is an arbitrary function, which corresponds to a forced
damped harmonic oscillator. Taking y = ˙x, we have ˙y = −γy − ω2
(1) with f (x, y, t) = y, and g(x, y, t) = −γy − ω2

0x + η(t). Then Eq. (14) reduces to

0x + η(t), which is of the form

and we can take σ = e−γt (any other choice would require the knowledge of the explicit form of

η) then from Eq. (10) we see that

σ

= γσ

which is satisﬁed with φ = −γy. Substituting all these expressions into Eq. (4) we have (with t

treated as a constant)

2
0x − η(t))dx + ydy = e

−γtdH

(ω

and, therefore, we can take H = eγt(y2/2 + ω2

0x2/2 − η(t)x). Finally, from Eq. (9) we ﬁnd that
p can be chosen as p = eγty. The corresponding Lagrangian can be calculated in the usual way,

by means of the Legendre transformation.

The results of the previous section allow us to readily derive those of Ref. 5, corresponding to

the autonomous case. In fact, when the functions f and g, appearing in Eqs. (1), do not depend
explicitly on the time, from Eqs. (4) and (1), taking φ = 0 = ψ, we have σ ˙H = −g ˙x + f ˙y =
−gf + f g = 0. This means that H is some constant of motion, which is not unique; we can
replace it by H ′ = G(H), with G being an arbitrary function. H ′ is also a constant of motion and

σ will not depend explicitly on t [see Eq. (10)], no matter what (time-independent) Hamiltonian

we choose.

The expressions given above allow us to ﬁnd H, which need not be related to the total energy.
In the example considered in the appendix of Ref. 5, f (x, y) = y, g(x, y) = −ky, where k is a
constant (i.e., ¨x = −k ˙x). Then, −gdx + f dy = kydx + ydy = yd(kx + y) and, therefore, we can

take σ = y and H = kx + y.

We end this section by considering the problem studied in Ref. 6 (which corresponds ap-

proximately to a relativistic particle subjected to a constant force, λ, and a force of friction

proportional to the square of the velocity), namely (with the appropriate changes in notation)

m ˙y = (λ − γy

),

where m represents a mass, λ, γ, and α are constants. Thus, f (x, y) = y, and g(x, y) =
(λ − γy2)(1 − α2y2)/m. Thus,

Despite the huge diﬀerence with the expressions given in Ref. 6, one can show that the Hamil-

tonian obtained in that reference is essentially the exponential of our H. (See, Eqs. (23) and

(26) of Ref. 6.)

4. The Helmholtz condition

The case where one starts with a second-order equation of the form

¨x = F (x, ˙x, t)

(15)

(considered in Refs. 2, 3), is a particular case of the treatment above if one deﬁnes, e.g., y ≡ ˙x,

that transforms Eq. (15) into the system

˙x = y,

˙y = F (x, y, t),

which is of the form (1) with f (x, y, t) = y and g(x, y, t) = F (x, y, t). Then Eq. (14) reduces to

d

−1

σ

= −σ

(16)

which is the Helmholtz condition when there is one degree of freedom (see, e.g., Ref. 2 and the
references cited therein; note that σ−1 = ∂p/∂y = ∂p/∂ ˙x = ∂2L/∂ ˙x2 is the integrating factor

w11 employed in these references).

On the other hand, not every system of equations of the form (1) comes from a second-order

equation ¨x = F (x, ˙x, t). An example is given by

where there is no coupling between the variables x, y. Here (choosing φ = 0 = ψ)

˙x = f (x, t),

˙y = g(y, t),

−gdx + f dy = f g

5. Concluding remarks

As we have shown, at least in the case of a system of two ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential equa-

tions, ﬁnding a Hamiltonian is essentially equivalent to ﬁnding an integrating factor for a linear

diﬀerential form in two variables. The integrating factor also determines the expression for the

canonical momentum. Equation (14) is analogous to the Helmholtz condition, but, in the present

approach, it leads directly to the Hamiltonian (in the standard approach, ﬁnding a solution to
the Helmholtz conditions, only gives the second partial derivatives ∂2L/∂ ˙xi∂ ˙xj). When the

system is non-autonomous, it is convenient to ﬁnd the integrating factor using Eq. (14), while

in the autonomous case, it may be more simply obtained from the linear diﬀerential form itself.

Finally, as shown in Sec. 4, there are systems of equations for which a Lagrangian does not exist,

but a Hamiltonian description can be given.

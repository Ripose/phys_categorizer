Abstract

The time dependent Schr¨odinger equation inclusive of curvature eﬀects is developed for a spinless

electron constrained to motion on a toroidal surface and subjected to circularly polarized and

linearly polarized waves in the microwave regime. A basis set expansion is used to determine

the character of the surface currents as the system is driven at a particular resonance frequency.

Surface current densities and magnetic moments corresponding to those currents are calculated. It

is shown that the currents can yield magnetic moments large not only along the toroidal symmetry

axis, but along directions tangential and normal to the toroidal surface as well.

INTRODUCTION

The control of a nanostructure’s state through electromagnetic interactions is of funda-
mental and practical interest [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Considerable eﬀort has been directed towards the
study of ﬂat quantum rings, which, because of their topology, give rise to Aharanov-Bohm

and persistent current eﬀects [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Currents
generated on a ring are restricted to yield magnetic moments perpendicular to the plane of

the ring; however, it is conceivable that structures with diﬀerent topologies are capable of
producing magnetic moments in diﬀerent directions, a feature potentially useful when such

structures are employed as nano-device elements. In this work, a toroidal structure in the
presence of an electromagnetic wave on the microwave scale is considered. In contrast to

rings, it is possible to excite modes for which currents circulate around the minor radius of
the toroidal surface T 2 (called in what follows “solenoidal modes” since the focus will be on
magnetic moments) in addition to the modes in which currents circulate azimuthally around

the major radius (“dipole modes”).

The approach adopted here will be to develop

H = H0 + V (t)

(1)

with H0 the Hamiltonian for a spinless electron constrained to motion on T 2 inclusive of
surface curvature eﬀects [21], and V (t) the time dependent electromagnetic interaction with
the form appropriate to circularly and linearly polarized microwaves propagating along the

symmetry axis of the torus (here the z-axis) at a particular resonant frequency of the system.
It has been shown that for the case of no external vector potential, it is possible to treat

the normal degree of freedom as a spectator variable [22]. However, inclusion of a vector
potential A with components normal to the surface complicates the situation. Reducing
the full three-dimensional problem to a two-dimensional eﬀective model serves to simplify

matters considerably. The resulting Schr¨odinger equation is then solved with standard
methods by taking (~ = 1)

Ψ(t) =

dnν(t)χn(θ)exp[iνφ]exp[−iEnνt]

(2)

with the χn(θ)exp[−iνφ]exp[−iEnνt] eigenstates of H0. Surface current densities (SCDs) are
determined and magnetic moments are calculated, from which it is shown that is it possible to
selectively generate dominant oscillatory magnetic moments in diﬀerent directions depending

on the character of the applied signal.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 the Hamiltonian on T 2 is
developed by beginning with a three dimensional formulation and proceeding to restrict the
particle (accounting for curvature)to T 2. In section 3 the eigenstates of H0 that comprise

the basis set are given and the solution method detailed. Section 4 presents results in the
form of plots of time dependent SCDs and magnetic moments. Section 5 is reserved for

conclusions.

2. THE SYSTEM HAMILTONIAN

This section presents a derivation of H(t) inclusive of surface curvature (SC) eﬀects. The

necessity of accounting for SC has been shown elsewhere [22]. The central idea is upon
restricting a particle in the neighborhood of a surface to the surface proper, a geometric
potential VC is necessary to capture the full three dimensional spectra and wave functions
with good ﬁdelity.

In this work, VC will not be the only geometric potential. The normal component of A
also couples to SC [16, 23]. It should also be noted that in general, the Laplacian on the
surface must be modiﬁed due to curvature. In the case of T 2 the symmetry of the system
precludes such modiﬁcations [21].

The Schr¨odinger equation for a spinless electron in the presence of a vector potential A(t)

(reinserting ~) is

To derive the gradient appearing in Eq. (3), let eρ, eφ, ez be unit vectors in a cylindrical
coordinate system. Points in the neighborhood of a toroidal surface of major radius R and
minor radius a may then be parameterized by

x(θ, φ, q) = (R + a cosθ)eρ + a sinθez + qen

with en(to be given momentarily) everywhere normal to T 2, and q the coordinate measuring
the distance from T 2 along en. The diﬀerential line element dx is then

dx = a(1 + k1q)eθdθ + W (θ, q)(1 + k2q)eφdφ + endq

with

A(t) =

(12)

with E0 the ﬁeld amplitude, ω the frequency and z = (a + q)sinθ is taken. The LPW case
can be obtained trivially from Eq. (12).

The procedure by which VC is obtained from Eqs. (3)-(11) is well known (more detailed
derivations can be found in [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]) and is summarized brieﬂy below.
Begin by making a product ansatz for the surface and normal parts of the wave function

Ψ(θ, φ, q) →

(1 + 2qh(θ) + q2k(θ))

with h(θ), k(θ) the mean and Gaussian curvatures of the surface [32], and imposing conser-
vation of the norm through

|Ψ(θ, φ, q)|2(1 + 2qh(θ) + q2k(θ))dΣdq → |χS(θ, φ)|2|χN (q)|2dΣdq

(14)

with dΣ the diﬀerential surface area. The Laplacian appearing in Eq. (3) takes the form

(the subscript on the gradient operator indicates only surface terms are involved)

with q appearing in ∇2
ations in Eq. (15) act upon the wave function given in Eq. (13) to yield

S as a parameter that can be immediately set to zero. The diﬀerenti-

in the q → 0 limit. The h2(θ) − k(θ) term above is proportional to VC(θ), and along with
VN (q), the remaining q diﬀerentiations can produce solutions conﬁned arbitrarily close to a
thin layer near the surface Σ.

As noted earlier, in addition to VC there is a second geometric potential that arises
from the normal part of the A · ∇ term in Eq. (3). Because any eﬀective potential on Σ

should only involve surface variables the operator AN (θ, φ, q) ∂
∂q must be addressed. One
prescription to deal with this operator has been given in [16] and another in [23] which is
chosen here. Begin by noting that the energy level spacing corresponding to the eigenvalues
for the χN (q) normal term is large compared to surface eigenvalues so it is safe to assume
there is negligible mixing among the χN (q) (this assumption was shown to be a reasonable
one in [22]). Let G = 1 + 2qh(θ) + q2k(θ) and proceed to integrate out any q-dependence by
writing

Note that the length gauge [1] is not employed here. Although implementing the gauge
transformation in a curved geometry that leads to the dipole term does not involve any

inherent diﬃculty, it is useful to report expressions for matrix elements should an extension
to this problem involving ionization be desired (as would be possible for ﬁnite layer rather

than ideal surface conﬁnement), or for cases involving thin tori with minor radii on the order
of a few angstroms subjected to visible laser light.

3. BASIS SET AND METHOD

In this work R will be set to 500˚A, a value in accordance with fabricated structures
[33, 34, 35, 36], and α = .5, a value which serves as a compromise between smaller α where
the solutions tend towards simple trigonometric functions and larger α which are less likely

to be physically realistic.

The eigenstates of H0 are found by diagonalizing H0 with a 60 state basis set expansion.
The sixty states comprise ﬁve azimuthal functions (ν = −2, ..., 2) multiplied by six positive
and six negative θ parity Gram-Schmidt (GS) functions. The GS functions are constructed to
be orthogonal over the integration measure F (θ) = 1 + α cosθ [37]. The energetically lowest

six states are dominated by the constant or cosθ mode. To create a non-zero net current
around the minor axis of the torus, some part of the wave function which behaves as einθ
must appear; it is not until the seventh state (as ordered by energy) that a sine term appears
which motivated the choice of the signal frequency as ω17 = ω7−ω1. The resonance frequency
1.
ωij (in natural units) between any two levels i and j is numerically 3.09 × 10−
The associated resonance wavelength between the ﬁrst and seventh states corresponds to
approximately 2 cm. The electric ﬁeld value chosen here is approximately 10 V /m, a value

8 (βj − βi)˚A−

large enough to induce eﬀects but small enough to justify the neglect of the quadratic vector
potential term in Eq. (3). The signal was applied to the structure for ten periods of the
inverse resonance frequency, for a time of 2.04×1010τ units, which is equivalent to tf = .68ns
with τ = 3 × 10−

11ns.

¯n¯ν|V (t)|nν

The matrix elements

can be evaluated analytically in terms of Bessel func-
tions [38]. The system of seven ﬁrst-ordered coupled equations is then solved for the dnν(t).
Selection rules between the ν and ¯ν are suﬃcient to render the system of coupled equations
relatively sparse allowing the system to be solved by standard methods.

tors eθ, eφ, en, but because the interest lies in comparing solenoidal to dipole modes, the
components along eρ, eφ, ez are shown instead. Explicit forms for the magnetic moments
Mρ(t), Mφ(t), Mz(t) are given in the Appendix.

Before presenting results for the currents and moments, it is worth showing representative
plots of the time dependent coeﬃcients di(t). First let L serve as a collective index for the
values i = 1....6. In Fig. 1, |d1(t)|2 and |d7(t)|2 for the LPW are shown, and Fig. 2 gives
the same for the CPW. In both situations, |d7(t)|2 is small as compared to the remaining
|dL(t)|2, but oscillate at a much slower frequency than the |dL(t)|2. As was noted previously,
it is d7(t) that must multiply the sine terms to combine with the positive θ parity parts of
the total wave function to yield currents around the minor radius, so it is the time scale of
d7(t) that will set the time scale and magnitudes of J(t) and M(t).

Results for SCDs as functions of θ evaluated at tf are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 for the
LPW. Fig. 3 plots J a
θ (tf , θ), the current calculated from employing only the dL(t), and Fig.
4 plots J b
θ (tf , θ), the current resulting from inclusion of d7(t) summed over the dL(t), both
at φ = 0. The results illustrate that the net current resulting from J a
θ (tf , θ) is zero, but
is non-zero for J b
θ (tf , θ). Figs. 5 and 6 plot the same quantities for the CPW. Results for
the azimuthal current Jφ(tf , φ) at θ = 0 and θ = π are shown in Figs. 7 for the LPW and
in Fig. 8 for the CPW. The contribution from terms proportional to d7(t) is always much
smaller than the contribution arising solely from the dL(t) terms, so they have not been
shown separately. No net azimuthal current results from the LPW, and only a small current
is present in for the CPW case.

In Fig. 9 the Mi(t) for the LPW are shown for a duration of tf at φ = π/2, θ = 0. The
surprising result here is that Mφ(t) is generally an order of magnitude larger than the dipole
moment Mz(t). Although not shown here, it is observed that as the torus is traversed in
the φ direction, the direction of the largest component of the magnetic moment is consistent

with a magnetic moment perpendicular to the direction of polarization. The corresponding

7

results for the CPW presented in Fig. 10 indicate that the dipole mode here is four orders
of magnitude larger than any solenoidal modes, a result that holds true at every angle.

The above results were applicable to an ideal situation wherein the structure is situated
on a surface transparent to microwaves. It is interesting to consider what is perhaps the

more realistic case of the incident wave interfering with its reﬂected part.

In order to see whether the interference of two polarized waves propagating along the

z-axis can enhance transitions to solenoidal modes, an incoming electromagnetic wave being
reﬂected at a completely reﬂecting ﬂat surface (‘mirror’) parallel to the horizontal symmetry
plane of the torus was considered. The mirror is positioned at variable distances z0 from
the central plane in order to study how superposition of the incoming and reﬂected linear
polarized wave fronts might aﬀect the relative amplitude of the solenoidal modes. The

general arguments will be made for the CPW; the LPW results are a special case of those
for the CPW.

At the mirror, the electric ﬁeld must satisfy the boundary condition of no total transverse

modes

Ein(z0, t) + Eout(z0, t) = 0,

(25)

The location and eﬀect of the reﬂecting mirror on the incoming wave front in this context
may be simply modeled in form of an additional phase φ0 = −2kz0 in the reﬂected ﬁeld
amplitude. The signs of ω and z0 can be chosen according from the incident direction of the
incoming wave. From Eq. (25), the reﬂected wave amplitude must be:

Eout(z, t) = E0

− cos(kz + ωt′)i + sin(kz + ωt′)j

(26)

with t′ = t − t0; and t0 = −2kz0/ω. Thus, the reﬂected wave amplitude can be obtained
from the incoming wave amplitude by letting

investigated. The general outcome is simple oscillatory behavior with diﬀerent but small
4 , all coeﬃcients d2, . . . , d7 are numerically
amplitudes while
nearly equal to zero, while d1 stays constant and identical to 1. This is due to the fact
that the electric ﬁeld amplitude E reaches its maximum value, thus the ﬁeld gradient is
essentially zero over the whole torus. In all of these cases, the system stays essentially in
the ground state and no transitions are observed.

The analogous results for the interference cases to those presented above are given below.
Figs. 11 and 12 show |d1(t)|2 and |d7(t)|2 plots for the LPW and CPW. It is worth noting
that while the |d7(t)|2 time scale does not vary greatly due to interference as compared to
the results in Figs. 1 and 2, the |d1(t)|2 time scale is very diﬀerent in both cases.

The SCD plots for the LPW do not appear qualitatively diﬀerent than the results already
presented in Figs. 3, 4 and 7, so in the interest of conciseness those results are not presented

here. However, an interesting result is shown in Fig. 13, wherein a clear signature of a
circulatory J b
θ (tf , θ) SCD at φ = 0 is shown for the CPW due to the presence of the d7(t)
term. Fig. 14 shows there is also a circulatory azimuthal SCD at θ = π.

The LPW magnetic moment results are given in Fig. 15. The frequency of oscillation
has again been reduced, and the overall magnitude of Mz(t) is smaller than that of Mφ(t).
Fig. 16 shows that for the CPW, Mz(t) > Mφ(t); this is observed to be independent of the
azimuthal point at which the Mi(t) are calculated.

5. CONCLUSIONS

This work presents a general framework for calculating surface current densities and mag-

netic moments on a toroidal surface in the presence of an electromagnetic wave. A proof
of principle calculation demonstrating that polarized microwaves can cause circulating sur-

face currents around the toroidal minor radius in addition to azimuthal currents was given.
Rather than employ the dipole approximation, matrix elements of the electromagnetic term

were evaluated in closed form. While there can be little doubt that the dipole approximation
would be perfectly valid for the system considered, there are cases involving ionization or

surface states with energies characterized by much smaller minor radii that warrant exact
expressions.

The magnetic moments calculated in this work show that it is in principle possible to

manipulate surface currents in a manner that causes the moments to “point” predominantly
in particular directions at certain times. Our preliminary results indicate that interference

due to reﬂection could potentially play an important role in the development of this topic.
The realization of the model problem considered here may be physically realizable with

current experimental methods by placing a thin layer of a good conductor over an InAs
toroidal structure. The extension of this work to metallic carbon nanotube tori is likely
possible but would require some eﬀort to account for the lattice. Preliminary work indicates

that modelling the carbon sites by weak delta function potentials requires a larger basis set

than employed here.

In the ﬁnal expression for the magnetic moment M, re-express ex and ey in terms of eφ and

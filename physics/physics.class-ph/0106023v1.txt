Abstract.- The use of generalized Lagrangians for describing
elementary particles was already claimed by Ostrogradskii.
It
is shown how the spin structure of elementary particles arises if
one allows the Lagrangian to depend on higher order derivatives.
One part is related to the rotation of the particle and the other,
which is coming from the dependence of the Lagrangian on the
acceleration, is known as the zitterbewegung part of spin.

Introduction

As early as 1736 Leonard Euler presented the book Mechanica in which
he established for the ﬁrst time Newtonian dynamics in terms of rational
mechanics. At that time Euler’s law of mechanics took the form:

the increase dv of the velocity is proportional to pdt, where p is
the power acting on the body during the time dt.1

Later, in 1740, in his work Methodus inveniendi lineas curvas, introduced
the calculus of variations, fundamental in the subsequent development of
analytical dynamics. He stated the variational principle in the form:

Since all the eﬀects of Nature obey some law of maximum or
minimum, it cannot be denied that the curves described by pro-
jectiles under the inﬂuence of some forces will enjoy the same
property of maximum or minimum. It seems easy to deﬁne, a
priori, using metaphysical principles, what this property is. But
since, with the necessary application, it is possible to determine
these curves by the direct method, it may be decided which is a
maximum or a minimum.

The magnitude which he considered to be stationary was mds√h, where
m is the mass of the body, ds the element of distance travelled and h the
height of fall. It was in 1749 at the Academy of Sciences of Berlin when he
presented Newton’s law in the standard form f = ma. Explicitly

1766 where he wrote as much as half of his extensive work and where he
died in 1783.

Joseph Louis Lagrange succeeded Euler in 1766 as director of mathemat-
ics in the Academy of Sciences of Berlin. In 1787 became a member of the
Paris Academy of Sciences where he published in 1788 the book M´ecanique
Analytique in which the methods of Lagrangian dynamics were introduced.
He said:

In the general motion of any system of bodies, actuated by mu-
tual forces of attraction, or by attraction towards ﬁxed centres
which are proportional to any function of the distance, the curves
described by the diﬀerent bodies, and their velocities, are nec-
essarily such that the sum of the products of each mass by the
integral of the product of the velocity and the element of the
curve is necessarily a maximum or a minimum; provided that
the ﬁrst and last points of each curve are regarded as ﬁxed,
so that the velocities of the corresponding coordinates at those
points are zero.2

In contrast with Newton’s Principia in which many geometrical diagrams
are used to produce the corresponding proofs, Lagrange enhanced the role
of analysis and made the following declaration

No diagrams will be found in this work. The methods that I
explain in it require neither constructions nor geometrical or me-
chanical arguments, but only the algebraic operations inherent

to a regular and uniform process. Those who love Analysis will,
with joy, see mechanics become a new branch of it and will be
grateful to me for thus having extended this ﬁeld.

As a consequence of Lagrange’s equations Mechanics rested on the Principle
of least action, or as stated above as the principle of the greatest or least
living force.

Mikhail Vasilevich Ostrogradskii, whose bicentennial we are celebrating,
left Ukraine at the age of 21 to study in Paris. Between 1822 and 1827 he
attended lectures by Laplace, Fourier, Legendre, Poisson and Cauchy and
publish several papers in the Paris Academy. He went to St Petersburg in
1828. Since then, Ostrogradskii lectured at the Naval Academy, from 1830
at the Institute of Communication and, from 1832, also at the Pedagogical
Institute. In 1847 he became chief inspector for the teaching of mathemati-
cal sciences in military schools. He established the conditions which allowed
Chebyshev’s school to ﬂourish in St Petersburg. He should also be consid-
ered as the founder of the Russian school of theoretical mechanics.
I am
not an expert in the History of Physics, but needless to say that Ostro-
gradskii was probably impregnated of Euler and Lagrange ideas during his
stay in Paris and St Petersburg. He was aware of the importance of vari-
ational methods in mechanics and the Lagrangian formalism in particular.
We are concerned in this contribution with his suggestion in 1850 of using
Lagrangians depending on higher order derivatives 3 and their usefulness to
describe classical spinning particles.

What is classical spin?

Because Newton’s equations for point particles are second order ordinary
diﬀerential equations for the position variables of the particles, the ac-
tion principle can be written in terms of the Lagrangian function, which
is therefore, an explicit function of the position variables and their ﬁrst
order time-derivatives. In rational mechanics this has been extended to ar-
bitrary systems in the sense that Lagrangians are postulated as functions
of the independent degrees of freedom qi and also of only their ﬁrst order
derivatives.

But this, which is world-wide accepted as the basis of point particle dy-
namics, will no longer be considered as such for the description of elementary
spinning particles. In general, classical spin is considered as some kind of
vector of constant magnitude, attached to the point particle, constant in
time for the free motion and when some interaction is present it experiences
some precession due to the torques of the external forces. But this idea of
a classical spin is diﬃcult to agree with the notion of electron’s spin when

and therefore neither the spin nor its absolute value are constants of the
motion for a free electron.

It is clear that the idea of a classical spin as a kind of pin stuck to the
point particle which remains constant whenever the particle is free and satis-
ﬁes some plausible dynamical equation when interacting, must be abandoned
or at least revisited. Therefore, if we do not know what are the necessary
variables to describe spin at the classical level we do not know whether they
must satisfy or not second order diﬀerential equations.

This has been one of the leading arguments to a thorough revision of
kinematics and dynamics, to consider the possibility of a classical descrip-
tion of spin. This has been done in previous works5, and a more detailed
and comprehensive analysis is collected in the book 6. A second important
argument has been the strength given in Lagrangian dynamics to the end
point variables of the variational formalism, as was already considered by
Lagrange in the mentioned statement of the previous section. We shall call
kinematical variables to the variables that deﬁne these end-points and
kinematical space to the manifold they span.

Classical Elementary Particles

For the revision of a classical description of matter we can take a look at
the successful way quantum mechanics describes both kinematics and dy-
namics. By kinematics we understand the basic statements that deﬁne the

In
physical objects we go to work with and their analytical description.
quantum mechanics, a state of an elementary particle is a vector state of an
irreducible representation of the kinematical group of space-time transfor-
mations that describes the Relativity Principle. 7 This is a group theoretical
deﬁnition of an elementary particle. Intrinsic attributes of the particles are
then interpreted in terms of group invariants and are therefore related to
the Casimir operators of the kinematical group or, properly speaking, to the
Casimir operators of their projective unitary irreducible representations.

Quantum dynamics describes the probability amplitudes for a whole pro-
cess in terms of the end point kinematical variables that characterize the
initial and ﬁnal states of the system. The details concerning the intermedi-
ate ﬂight of the particles involved, are not explicit in the ﬁnal form of the
result. They are all removed in the calculation process, enhancing the role,
as far as the theoretical analysis is concerned, of the initial and ﬁnal data.
This looks similar, at least in a formal way, to the variational formalism.
But when one quantizes a Lagrangian system by means of Feynman’s path
integral approach8, this probability amplitude (there called Feynman’s ker-
nel) becomes a function of only the initial and ﬁnal kinematical variables of
the classical system.

Therefore, in the classical approach, we deﬁne a classical elementary
particle by giving a group theoretical characterization to the kinematical
variables of the action integral of the Lagrangian. We postulate the following

Deﬁnition.- A classical elementary particle is a Lagrangian sys-
tem whose kinematical space is a homogeneous space of the kine-
matical group.

From the mathematical viewpoint the largest homogeneous space of a Lie
group is the group itself and therefore this deﬁnition restricts the maximum
number of kinematical variables to the number of group parameters. Any
homogeneous space of a group inherits not only part of the structure of
the group it comes from, but at the same time the physical dimensions of
the corresponding parameters. It is the group and the variables we use to
parametrize it which determine the basic variables that deﬁne a classical
elementary particle, and also their physical or geometrical interpretation.

In this way we do not state that Lagrangians depend only on ﬁrst order
derivatives. This method depends only on the kind of variables we ﬁx as
end-points of the variational process. Once the end-points are ﬁxed, the
variational problem requires for the Lagrangian to depend on the next order
of derivation of all the kinematical variables. It is this construction which
will produce, or not, the dependence on higher order derivatives, so that the

restriction of using ﬁrst order Lagrangians is a consequence of the particular
election of the kinematical variables.

Mathematical properties of the Lagrangian

i

When we have a generalized Lagrangian L(t, qi, . . . , q(k)
), which is an ex-
plicit function of time t, of the n degrees of freedom qi, i = 1, . . . , n and
their derivatives up to some ﬁnite order k, q(k)
dkqi/dtk, the kinematical
variables are therefore the time t, the n degrees of freedom qi, i = 1, . . . , n
and their derivatives up to order k
1. These are the variables we have to
leave ﬁxed at the initial time t1 and ﬁnal time t2 of the action functional. We
denote them genericaly by xl, l = 0, . . . , nk where we take x0 = t, xi = qi,
xn+i = q(1)
, and so on. We clearly see that L depends also on the next order
derivative of the kinematical variables.

Now, to produce a coherent relativistic formalism we need ﬁrst to with-
draw the time as evolution parameter, and consider that evolution is de-
scribed in terms of some arbitrary parameter τ . Therefore, the time deriva-
tive q(1)
i = dqi/dt should be replaced by q(1)

Simple examples

Let us start ﬁrst with the Newtonian point particle. By deﬁnition its kine-
matical variables for its Lagrangian formalism are time t and position r.
Let us assume ﬁrst that the set of inertial observers are all at rest with their
Cartesian frames parallel with respect to each other so that the kinemat-
ical group is just the space-time translation group. Then the kinematical
relation between observers is given by the group action

at any instant of the evolution parameter τ . This four-parameter group has
four generators H and P . In the action (4) the generators are the diﬀerential

We see that the kinematical space of our point particle is in fact iso-
morphic to the whole kinematical group, so that our kinematical variables
(t, r) have the same domains and dimensions as the group parameters
x
(b, a), respectively. The kinematical space X is clearly the largest homoge-
neous space of the kinematical group.

According to this restricted Relativity Principle, the Lagrangian for a
point particle will be a function of the variables (t, r, ˙t, ˙r), and a homo-
geneous function of ﬁrst degree in terms of the derivatives ( ˙t, ˙r). Then,
according to (2), it can be written as

with T = ∂L/∂ ˙t and R = ∂L/∂ ˙r. Since the space-time translation group
has no central extensions and thus no non-trivial exponents, Lagrangians can
be taken strictly invariant under this group. Terefore, dynamical equations
can be any autonomous second order diﬀerential equation of the functions
r(t), not depending explicitly on the variables r and t.

When applying Noether’s theorem for this kinematical group we obtain
as constants of the motion, the energy H =
T and the linear momentum
P = R. Possible Lagrangians for this kind of systems are very general and
might be any arbitrary function of the components of the velocity dri/dt.
The homogeneity condition in terms of kinematical variables implies that,
for instance, expressions of the form

Lagrangians.

Let us go further and extend the kinematical group to include rotations.

Then, the kinematical transformations are

(8)

where R(β) represents a rotation matrix written in terms of three parameters
βi of a suitable parametrization of the rotation group. This group is called
the Aristotle group GA. In addition to H and P , it has three new generators
J , that in the above action (8) are given by the operators J = r
.
× ∇
This group also does not have central extensions, and thus no nontrivial
exponents. Lagrangians in this case will be also invariant. This additional
rotation invariance leads to the conclusion that L, which still has the general
form (7), will be an arbitrary function of ˙r2.

(9)

We clearly see, by comparing (9) with (8), that the kinematical space X of
our point particle is isomorphic to the homogeneous space of the group, X
≃
GA/SO(3). It corresponds to the coset space of elements of the form (t, r, 0)

9

(10)

(11)

when acting on the subgroup SO(3) of elements (0, 0, β). The kinematical
variables (t, r) span the same manifold and have the same dimensions as the
set of group elements of the form (b, a, 0).

But once we have a larger symmetry group, we can extend our deﬁni-
tion of elementary particle to the whole group GA. The physical system
might have three new kinematical variables α, the angular variables. In a
τ -evolution description of the dynamics, with the identiﬁcation in g′′ = g′g
x(τ ) and g′ playing the role of the group element g acting
of g′′
on the left on x, we get x′ = gx. Taking into account (9), they explicitly
transform as:

x′(τ ), g

(τ ) = t(τ ) + b, r′

(τ ) = R(β)r(τ ) + a,

as in (8) and also for the new degrees of freedom

R(α′

(τ )) = R(β)R(α(τ )).

The seven kinematical variables of our elementary particle are now time
t, position r and orientation α. Our system can be interpreted as a point
with a local Cartessian frame attached to it. This local frame can rotate,
and rotation of this frame is described by the evolution of the new variables
α. Then the Lagrangian for this system will be also a function of α and
˙α, or equivalently of the angular velocity ω of the moving frame. The
homogeneity condition allows us to write

L as

L = T ˙t + R

˙r + W

where T and R, are deﬁned as before (7), and W = ∂

Now, total energy is H =

momentum takes the form

J = r

P + W .

The particle, in addition to the angular momentum r
P , has now a trans-
lation invariant angular momentum. The particle, a point and a rotating
frame like the usual description of a rigid body, has spin W .

×

Nevertheless we have seen that while restricting ourselves to the Aristotle
kinematical group we do not obtain generalized Lagrangians. All above
Lagrangians depend only on the ﬁrst order derivative of variables r and α.
The Principle of Inertia by Galileo enlarges the Aristotle kinematical
group GA to the whole Galilei group
. The physical laws of dynamics must
G
be independent of the uniform relative motion between inertial observers
and this sets up a new kinematical group with a more complex structure.
The action of the Galilei group is deﬁned as

which contains three new parameters v, the relative velocity between ob-
servers.

new generators K, which in the above group action are given by K = t

In addition to the generators H, P and J , the Galilei group has three
.
We see that once we have a larger group we can also enlarge, in an ap-
propriate way, the kinematical variables of our point particle. The largest
homogeneous space will contain as kinematical variables the time t, posi-
tion r and orientation α, as the corresponding parameters of the Aristotle
group but also the velocity of the particle u
dr/dt which comes from the
corresponding group parameter v. Now the Lagrangian will be a function
of these kinematical variables and their next order derivatives, i.e., it must
necessarily depend on the acceleration du/dt of the particle.
It is a La-
grangian that depends on the second derivative of the position variables r.
We thus get a generalized Lagrangian for describing an elementary particle
which will have a spin structure that, in addition to the rotational spin as
in the previous model, it has spin related to the zitterbewegung as we shall
describe in the next non-relativistic example.

≡

A non-relativistic spinning particle

We thus see that the most general non-relativistic particle will be described
by a Lagrangian which is a function of the variables t, r, u, α and ˙t, ˙r, ˙u, ˙α,
being homogeneous of ﬁrst degree in terms of these last ones. It therefore
can be written as

L = T ˙t + R

where we have replaced ˙α by the angular velocity ω which is a linear function
of it and where here the new functions Ui = ∂

The Galilei group has non-trivial exponents10 and thus, according to
(3) the Lagrangian is not invariant under the whole Galilei group but it
transforms with the gauge function

We see that if the group parameter v = 0 this gauge function vanishes so
that the non-invariance of the Lagrangian is coming only from its change
under pure Galilei transformations.

It is the presence of the U function that distinguishes the features of this
system with respect to the point particle case. We ﬁnd that the total linear
momentum is not lying along the direction of the velocity u, and the spin
structure is directly related to the dependence of the Lagrangian on the
acceleration.

We can think that the observable Z = u

U is the spin of the system.
We shall deﬁne the spin properly after the deﬁnition of the center of mass
of the particle. Nevertheless, magnitude Z looks like Dirac’s spin operator,
since taking the time derivative of (25), which is a constant of the motion,
we get

where (31) is just eq. (20) after twice diﬀerentiating (30), and Equation (32)
is (30) after collecting all terms on the left hand side.

From (31) we see that point q moves in a straight trajectory at constant
velocity while the motion of point r, given in (32), is an isotropic harmonic
motion of angular frequency ω around point q.

The spin of the system S is now deﬁned as the angular momentum of
the system but substracted the orbital angular momentum of its center of

It is the sum of the orbital angular momentum L associated to the motion
of the center of mass and the spin part S. For a free particle both L and
S are separately constants of the motion. We use the term (anti)orbital to

suggest that if vector k represents the position of a point mass m, the angular
momentum of this motion is in the opposite direction as the obtained spin
observable. But as we shall see in a moment, vector k does not represent
the position of the mass m but rather the position of the charge e of the
particle.

Now one question arises: If q represents the center of mass position, then
what position does point r represent? Point r represents the position of the
charge of the particle. This can be seen by considering some interaction
with an external ﬁeld. The homogeneity condition of the Lagrangian in
terms of the derivatives of the kinematical variables leads us to consider an
interaction term of the form

eφ(t, r) ˙t + eA(t, r)

which is linear in the derivatives of the kinematical variables t and r and
where the external potentials are only functions of t and r. More general
interaction terms of the form N (t, r, u)
˙u, and also more general terms
in which functions φ and A also depend on u and ˙u, can be considered.
But this will be something diﬀerent than an interaction with an external
electromagnetic ﬁeld.

the interaction term does not modify the dependence of the Lagrangian on
˙u, the function U = mk has the same expression as in the free particle
case. Therefore the spin and the center of mass deﬁnitions, (35) and (30)
respectively, remain the same as in the previous case. Dynamical equations

where the center of mass q satisﬁes Newton’s equations under the action
of the total external Lorentz force, while point r still satisﬁes the isotropic
harmonic motion of angular frequency ω around point q. But the external
force and the ﬁelds are deﬁned at point r and not at point q.
It is the
velocity u of point r that appears in the magnetic term of the Lorentz
force. Point r clearly represents the position of the charge.
In fact, this
minimal coupling we have considered is the coupling of the electromagnetic
potentials with the particle current, but the current jµ is associated to the
motion of a charge e located at the point r.

15

This charge has an oscillatory motion of very high frequency ω that, in
1021s−1. The
the case of the relativistic electron is ω = 2mc2/¯h
average position of the charge is the center of mass, but it is this internal
orbital motion, usually known as the zitterbewegung, that gives rise to
the spin structure and also to the magnetic properties of the particle.

When analyzed in the center of mass frame q = 0, r = k, the system
reduces to a point charge whose motion is in general an ellipse, but if we
D = 0, it reduces to a circle of radius a = C = D,
choose C = D, and C
orthogonal to the spin. Then if the particle has charge e, it has a magnetic
moment that according to the usual classical deﬁnition is: 11

where j = eδ3(r
k)dk/dt is the current associated to the motion of a point
charge e located at position k. The magnetic moment is orthogonal to the
zitterbewegung plane and opposite to the spin if e > 0. It also has a non-
vanishing oscillating electric dipole d = ek, orthogonal to µ and therefore
to S in the center of mass frame, such that its time average value vanishes
for times larger than the natural period of this internal motion.

Although this is a nonrelativistic example it is interesting to point out
and compare with Dirac’s relativistic analysis of the electron, 12 in which
both, magnetic and electric momenta µ and d, respectively, appear giving
rise to two possible interacting terms in Dirac’s Hamiltonian.

The gyromagnetic ratio

The most general spinning particle under a Galilei Relativity Principle is
the one with a kinematical space X =
. As mentioned before, the most
general Lagrangian has the form (13). What is important of its anlysis is
the structure of the kinematical momentum K and angular momentum J.
They have the general form:

G

K = mr

P t

U ,

−
as in the previous restricted example and where the observable U , which
is coming from the dependence of the Lagrangian on the acceleration, is
responsible of the separation between the center of mass and center of charge.
The zitterbewegung appears whenever we use generalized Lagrangians on
the position variables and the point r represents the center of charge of the
particle. If U does not vanish the particle has magnetic moment.

alent to Dirac’s spin operator and contains two parts: One u
U related to
the zitterbewegung and therefore to the magnetic moment of the particle,
and another W related to the rotation of the particle as in the case of a
rigid body, but which plays no role in the dipole structure of the particle.

We see a clear kinematical feature: The magnetic moment is only related
to the zitterbewegung part of the spin. Therefore, from the experimental
point of view, we can measure mechanical and electromagnetic properties
of the particle. When measuring the conserved spin of the particle, it is
not possible to separate the measurement of both spin components. This
implies that when expressed the magnetic moment in terms of the total
spin their relationship is not the usual one and this produces the concept of
gyromagnetic ratio g. The zitterbegung part of the spin only quantizes with
integer values, because it has the structure of an orbital angular momentum.
Half integer values can come only from the rotation part of the spin. This
salient feature has recently been shown to lead to a gyromagnetic ratio
g = 2 for leptons and charged W ± bosons whenever both components of spin
contribute with their lowest admisible values. 13 Deviations of g
2 are thus
produced by radiation corrections as is shown in quantum electrodynamics.

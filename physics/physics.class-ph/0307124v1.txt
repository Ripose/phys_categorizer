Potentials of a uniformly moving point charge in the Coulomb

Abstract

The gauge function for the transformation between the Lorentz and Coulomb
gauges is calculated for a uniformly moving point charge. It is shown that
the expression obtained for the diﬀerence between the vector potentials in the
two gauges satisﬁes the requisite inhomogeneous wave equation and a Poisson
equation to which this wave equation can be reduced.

I. INTRODUCTION

Gauge invariance is an important property of electrodynamics. Notwithstanding the
thorough attention it has received in textbooks,1–4 the topic of gauge invariance seems to
be still very much alive. Recently, articles have appeared on the resolution of apparent
causality problems in the Coulomb gauge,5 the transformation from the Lorentz gauge to
the Coulomb and some other gauges,6 and the historical development of the whole concept
of gauge invariance.7 A discordant voice in this is a claim by Onoochin8 that the electric
ﬁeld of a uniformly moving point charge comes out diﬀerently when it is calculated in the
Lorentz and Coulomb gauges, which this author takes as evidence that the two gauges are
not physically equivalent.

An explicit expression for the Coulomb-gauge vector potential of a uniformly moving
charge does not seem to have appeared in the literature, and so the formulae for the trans-
formation between the Lorentz and Coulomb gauges given by Jackson6 have come timely
to provide an analytical check on the claim of Onoochin. The purpose of the present paper
is to clear up the problem of the Coulomb-gauge potentials of a uniformly moving charge
using Jackson’s results as well as other methods.

In Sec. II, we calculate the diﬀerence between the potentials in the Lorentz and Coulomb
gauges for a uniformly moving point charge using the formalism of Jackson’s paper,6 which
guarantees that the two gauges will yield the same electric and magnetic ﬁelds. In Sec. III,
we demonstrate that the expression obtained for the diﬀerence between the vector potentials
in the two gauges satisﬁes the inhomogeneous wave equation for this diﬀerence, and in Sec.
IV we show where and why the procedure used by Onoochin for solving that wave equation

calculational details.

II. TRANSFORMATION FROM THE LORENTZ GAUGE TO THE COULOMB
GAUGE

The scalar potential V and the vector potential A of a uniformly moving point charge
in the Lorentz gauge, deﬁned by the condition ∇·A + ∂A/c∂t = 0, are well known. For
a point charge q moving with a constant velocity v = vˆx, the Lorentz-gauge potentials VL
and AL are given by (we shall use the Gaussian system of units):

VL(r, t) =

where γ = (1
origin x=y=z=0 at time t = 0 (see, e.g., Ref. 3, Sec. 19-3). In the Coulomb gauge, deﬁned
by the condition ∇·A = 0, the scalar potential VC of the charge takes a particularly simple
form,

as the scalar potential in this gauge is exactly the same as that of the instantaneous Coulomb
interaction of electrostatics. On the other hand, the Coulomb-gauge vector potential AC is

The gauge invariance of electrodynamics implies that there is a gauge function χC that

connects the Coulomb- and Lorentz-gauge potentials by

AC = AL + ∇χC,

which ensures that the Lorentz-gauge and Coulomb-gauge potentials will yield the same
electric and magnetic ﬁelds. This is because the ﬁelds are generated from the potentials via
the prescription

∂A(r, t)

B(r, t) = ∇×A(r, t),

diﬀerent gauges are guaranteed to vanish:

Nevertheless, it should be instructive to demonstrate explicitly that it is indeed so also in
the present case by ﬁnding the requisite gauge function. Before we turn to this task, we
give here for completeness the ﬁelds that the prescription (5) yields with the Lorentz-gauge
potentials VL and AL of Eq. (1):

The same expressions for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds can be obtained also by Lorentz-

in the rest-frame variables x′, y′, z′; the potentials V ′

IV. POISSON’S EQUATION FOR THE VECTOR-POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE

Onoochin8 attempts to solve the x-component of the inhomogeneous wave equation (23)
AL directly by reducing it to a Poisson equation, which is a method
for the diﬀerence AC −
based on the fact that the space and time partial derivatives are not independent when the
source term is moving uniformly (see Ref. 3, Sec. 19-3). In the present case, the dependence
on the variables x and t is only through the combination x
vt, and thus the x-component
of the diﬀerence AC −

This value is in direct conﬂict with the result (16) that we obtained for the diﬀerence

AC x −
partial time derivative of (32) does not vanish, the result (32), if it were the true diﬀerence
AC x −
AL x at y = z = 0, would lead to a non-zero diﬀerence between the Coulomb- and
Lorentz-gauge x-components of the electric ﬁeld at y = z = 0. This is Onoochin’s evidence
against the equivalence of the Lorentz and Coulomb gauges.9

The fault is with the standard integral solution (31)—it simply does not give the correct
solution to the Poisson equation (30). The reason for this is that the right-hand side of
(30) is not a suﬃciently well-behaved function in the vicinity of the point χ = y = z = 0.
However, the integral expression (31) will give the correct solution to the Poisson equation

three-dimensional integration of the regularized integral solution resulted in values that
approached closely those of the solution (37) when the regularization parameter a was made
suﬃciently small.

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We found an explicit expression for the gauge function of the transformation between
the Lorentz and Coulomb gauges for a uniformly moving point charge. The Coulomb-gauge
potentials obtained using the gauge function are guaranteed to yield the same electric and
magnetic ﬁelds as the well-known Lorentz-gauge potentials of the charge. The expression
obtained for the diﬀerence between the vector potentials in the two gauges satisﬁes the
Poisson equation to which the inhomogeneous wave equation for this diﬀerence reduces
after a transformation of the variables. However, the right-hand side of the Poisson equation
equation has a singularity arising from the vanishing extension of a point charge, and the
standard recipe for its solution has to be suitably regularized to yield the correct solution.
Although gauge invariance is a foregone conclusion in a gauge-invariant theory, we believe
that the calculations exhibiting the equivalence of the Lorentz and Coulomb gauges in the
basic problem of a uniformly moving charge were an instructive exercise.

jections against “mainstream” electrodynamics motivated the writing of this paper.

This is a function of x with no singularities (it does not diverge at the roots of the denom-
inators), displaying a minimum near x = 0 that moves closer to x = 0 and deepens and
narrows as the regularization parameter a tends to zero; its derivative is discontinuous at
x = X.

Abstract. We study electromagnetic wave propagation in mediums in which the
eﬀective relative permittivity and the eﬀective relative permeability are allowed to
take any value in the upper half of the complex plane. A general condition is derived
for the phase velocity to be oppositely directed to the power ﬂow. That extends the
recently studied case of propagation in mediums for which the relative permittivity
and relative permeability are both simultaneously negative, to include dissipation as
well. An illustrative case study demonstrates that in general the spectrum divides into
ﬁve distinct regions.

1. Introduction

including inverse refraction, negative radiation pressure,

Materials with either negative real relative permittivity or negative real relative
permeability at a certain frequency are not uncommon. Consideration of materials for
which both these quantities are simultaneously negative and real–valued, commenced
with Veselago’s paper of 1968 [1]. Although he pointed out many unusual properties
of such materials,
inverse
Doppler eﬀect, over three decades ago, the considerations were completely speculative
in view of the lack of a material, or even a nonhomogeneous composite medium, with
a relative permittivity having a negative real part and a very small imaginary part. A
breakthrough was achieved by Smith et al. [2], who, developing some earlier ideas by
Pendry et al. [3, 4, 5], presented evidence for a weakly dissipative composite medium
displaying negative values for the real parts of its eﬀective permittivity and eﬀective
permeability. Their so–called meta–material consists of various inclusions of conducting
rings and wires embedded within printed circuit boards. Their conclusions were based
on observations from three separate composite mediums.

•

Medium 1 consisted of a lattice of ring–like inclusions, which for a certain ﬁeld
conﬁguration was presumed to have a resonant relative permeability µef f (ω) of the
form [2, 5]

where the resonance frequency ω0 depends principally on the geometry of the rings.
In this model, dissipation is facilitated by Γ, and F (0 < F < 1) is the ratio of the
area occupied by a ring and that of a unit cell. For weak dissipation, the real part
of µef f is negative for ω0 < ω < ω0/√1
Medium 2 consisted of an included matrix of wires.

permittivity ǫef f of this composite medium supposedly displays plasma–like

medium, ǫef f is negative for ω < ωp.
Medium 3 combined the ﬁrst two, it being postulated that the combination would
exhibit negative real–valued permeability and negative real–valued permittivity
within a certain frequency range. Although some numerical and experimental
evidence was presented in 2000 [2], the most striking report appeared the following
year [6] and gave preliminary indications of the observation of the so–called negative
index of refraction.

In such a

Other types of nanostructural combinations with similar response properties can also

The emergence of a clear terminology is often a diﬃcult process with regards
to scientiﬁc ﬁndings relating to novel eﬀects, something that is also apparent in the
present instance. The original classiﬁcation of the materials exhibiting the eﬀects
discussed labelled them left–handed electromagnetic materials [1]. But chiral materials
are important subjects of electromagnetics research and the terms left–handedness and
right–handedness have been applied to the molecular structure of such materials for
well over a century [8]. The continued use of the term left–handed materials (LHMs)
for achiral materials in, for example, [2, 6, 9] will thus confuse the crucial issues. Other
authors [10] are promoting the term backward medium (BW) which presumes the a
priori deﬁnitions of forward and backward directions. In the most recent contribution
[11] (which also provides the most extensive theoretical and numerical analysis of
the negative index of refraction to date), the authors introduce the technical term
double negative (DNG) medium to indicate that the real parts of both permittivity
and permeability are negative. While sensible enough, such nomenclature conceals the
importance of dissipative eﬀects.

In time, a consensus about terminology will undoubtedly emerge; and it is not
our aim to contribute to this particular discussion. Instead the purpose of this note is
pedagogical. In the ﬁrst instance, it is important that dissipation be included in the
analysis. This was largely neglected in the reports cited earlier, with the exemption of
the most recent study [11].

Secondly, it is desirable to derive the general condition for the type of anomalous
propagation that is characteristic of the considered materials: namely, where the phase
velocity is directed oppositely to the power ﬂow.

2. Plane Wave Propagation

Consider a plane wave propagating along the z axis in a linear, homogeneous, isotropic,
dielectric–magnetic medium whose relative permittivity and relative permeability are
denoted by ǫr and µr, respectively. An exp(
iωt) time–dependence is assumed here.
Then

Let us now assume a Lorentzian model for ǫr and µr. This will include the speciﬁed
forms (1) and (2) as special cases. Dissipation results from the imaginary parts of ǫr
and µr whilst causality dictates that Im[µr] > 0 and Im[ǫr] > 0, so that ǫr and µr lie in
the upper half of the complex plane.

However, there are two resultant complex refractive indexes, n± =

√ǫrµr, of
which n+ lies in the upper half of the complex plane and n− in the lower half. The
situation is summarized in Figure 1 for which the resonant form of (1) was used as
representative of both ǫr(ω) and µr(ω). Of course, the resonances of ǫr(ω) and µr(ω)
are unlikely to coincide, so that for a particular value of ω, the arrows corresponding to
ǫr and µr will not be necessarily parallel. Only the upper half of the complex plane is
shown in the ﬁgure.

Thus the choice n+ always relates to power ﬂow in the +z direction, whilst n− always

power ﬂow is always in the direction of exponential decrease of the ﬁelds’ amplitudes.

We can now identify when the phase velocity is opposite to the direction of power
ﬂow. This occurs whenever Re[n+] < 0 (and consequently Re[n−] > 0, also). After

It should be
remarked though, that the parameter space of the permittivity and permeability
that fulﬁls (14) and (15) is only a subset of the one fulﬁlling (12). In any case,
r < 0, and (15) holds if and only if µ′
(14) holds if and only if ǫ′
r < 0 (we remind
the reader that ǫ′′
r > 0, µ′′
r > 0 because of causality requirements). We note that
r < 0 and µ′
ǫ′
r < 0 can only occur close to absorption resonances (as discussed in
the previous item).

•

Finally, consider an electromagnetic wave propagating in a plasma below the plasma
frequency (ǫ′
1).
Straighforward Taylor expansions reduce inequality (12) to

Therefore, the existence of the type of anomalous propagation being studied here
depends in this case crucially on the ratio of the imaginary parts of the relative
permittivity and relative permeability. Whether the criterion (16) is satisﬁed or
not, the power ﬂow in this case is in any case small.

3. A detailed illustrative case study

for both ǫr and µr; thus,

Figures 2a and 2b comprise plots of the real and imaginary parts of ǫr and µr
as functions of λ0, when pe = 1, pm = 0.8, Ne = Nm = 100, λe = 0.3 mm and
λm = 0.32 mm. Clearly, ﬁve separate spectral regions can be identiﬁed in Figure 2.
At the either extremity of the horizontal axis are the two regions wherein ǫ′
r > 0 and
µ′
r > 0. Both ǫ′
r > 0. In the neighbourhood of λ0 = 0.22 mm, ǫ′
r < 0 and

λ0 = 0.31 mm. Of course, both ǫ′′

Detailed calculations conﬁrm that the spectral region wherein the inequality (12) is
r < 0). The former

satisﬁed is larger than the middle region (wherein both ǫ′
cover parts of the adjoining regions, in which either (14) or (15) holds.

In the ﬁve spectral regions identiﬁed, the isotropic dielectric–magnetic medium
would respond diﬀerently to monochromatic electromagnetic excitation. Suppose that
a plane wave is normally incident on a half–space occupied by this medium. The
reﬂectance R(λ0) is then given by the standard expression

particularly low in the leftmost and the rightmost regions (ǫ′

4. Conclusions

In this pedagogical note, we have derived a general condition for the phase velocity to be
oppositely directed to the power ﬂow in isotropic dielectric–magnetic mediums in which
the only constraints on the values of the relative permittivity and relative permeability
are those imposed by causality. In this regard, the topical case of mediums in which ǫr
and µr have negative real parts is seen to be a suﬃcient, but not necessary, condition
for such propagation, as noted in the comments succeeding (12). An illustrative case
study has shown that there are, in general, ﬁve distinct spectral regions, characterized
by the various sign combinations of the real parts of ǫr and µr.

Abstract : The classical two-body system with Lorentz-invariant Coulomb action-
at-a-distance V =
k/ρ is solved in 3+1 dimensions using the manifestly covari-
ant Hamiltonian mechanics of St¨uckelberg. Particular solutions for the reduced
motion are obtained which correspond to bound attractive, unbound attrac-
tive, and repulsive scattering motion. A lack of perihelion precession is found
in the bound attractive orbit, and the semi-classical hydrogen spectrum subse-
quently contains no ﬁne structure corrections. It is argued that this prediction
is indicative of the correct classical special relativistic two-body theory.

1 Introduction

One of the most signiﬁcant applications of the St¨uckelberg relativistic dynamics
[1, 2] is certainly the classical two-body problem. The signiﬁcance arises from the
fact that the St¨uckelberg mechanics allows the use of Lorentz-invariant action-
at-a-distance in the form V = V (ρ), ρ = ρ(τ )1, to model long-range mutual
interaction between particles.

In this paper we study the classical covariant Kepler problem, i.e., the clas-
sical special relativistic two-body problem with scalar Coulomb action-at-a-
distance V =
k/ρ, where k > 0 is an invariant constant. Although certain
solutions for this potential were obtained by Cook [3] and by Piron and Reuse
[4], the full range of physical motion produced by this potential has not yet been
investigated.

−

In this paper we outline2 two separate methods to study the reduced two-
body motion for this potential using the pseudospherical coordinates (ρ, β, θ, φ)

1The parameter τ is the invariant dynamical time; see ref. [2].
2A more complete discussion of these solutions is given in ref. [5]. The 1+1-dimensional

version of this system is also discussed in ref. [6].

suggested by Cook3. Both methods are generalizations of solutions of the non-
relativistic inverse-square potential V =
k/r. In the ﬁrst method, we integrate
the Euler-Lagrange equations for the central force V = V (ρ) to obtain a set of
Lorentz-invariant isolating integrals, which are solved for a set of classical orbit
equations in the pseudospherical coordinates. We plot particular solutions for
the invariant Coulomb potential in the 2+1 dimensional particle separation co-
ordinates (∆x(τ ), ∆y(τ ), ∆t(τ )). In the second method, we solve the classical
Hamilton-Jacobi equation to obtain the Lorentz-invariant action variables for
the central force potential. In the case of the Coulomb potential, we impose the
rule of semi-classical quantization to obtain a prediction for the electron energy
levels of hydrogen.

−

The classical orbit solutions of the potential V =

k/ρ will be shown to
produce all three types of physical motion expected for the two-body system
with inverse-square interaction—i.e., bound attractive, unbound attractive, and
repulsive scattering motion—with the distinction being given in a straightfor-
ward manner by a pair of Lorentz-invariant eccentricity constants4. The most
striking prediction in these solutions is the lack of perihelion precession in the
bound orbits of the special relativistic system5. As a result of this lack of
precession, the semi-classical hydrogen spectrum contains no ﬁne structure cor-
rections.
It is argued that this result is favorable to the St¨uckelberg theory,
based on consideration of the classical limit without spin.

2 The Classical and Semi-Classical Solutions

Consider an isolated system of two particles with constant ﬁnite rest masses mi,
i = 1, 2, and mutual long-range interaction over ﬂat spacetime. It is well known
[2, 8, 9, 10] that in the covariant mechanics, the most straightforward solution
of the classical problem with scalar interaction is obtained by a transformation
from the individual particle event coordinates (xµ
2 (τ )), µ = 0, 1, 2, 3, to
the covariant center-of-mass and reduced coordinates, (X µ(τ ), xµ(τ )). The sys-
tem can be regarded as comprising two ﬁctitious particles with masses M and
m. The transformations are

M = m1 + m2,

In these coordinates, the nontrivial motion of the system occurs entirely in the
reduced problem, for which the frame components are xµ = (∆t, ∆x, ∆y, ∆z).
The most convenient procedure is to make a second coordinate transforma-
tion of the reduced problem to the pseudospherical coordinates of Cook [3],
which consist of the variable spacetime separation ρ = ρ(τ ), as well as a space-
time angle β = β(τ ), and two ordinary angles θ = θ(τ ) and φ = φ(τ ). The

between the two cases is absorbed in the deﬁnition of the eccentricity constants; see ref. [5].

It can be shown[9] that the conservation of a covariant angular momentum
tensor implies that the polar angle θ can be eliminated from the problem by
an ordinary three-rotation of the coordinate axes, i.e., by choice of a frame in
which ˙θ

then possible to study the classical problem in 2+1 dimensions without loss of

From the orbital solutions θ = θ(β) and ρ = ρ(β), the physical motion
produced by the Coulomb interaction can be understood by using the inverse
transformations of (3) to plot in the frame coordinates (∆x(β), ∆y(β), ∆t(β)).
If it is desired, the τ dependence of the solution may be included by numerical
inversion of the expression τ = τ (β) obtained from integration of eqs. (5) [5].

It is useful to examine the dependence of the Type I and Type II solutions
upon the eccentricities e′ and e′′, as well as upon f , the rotational constant6.
For a given e′ or e′′, the eﬀect of the variation of f is simply to modify the
scale and proportion of the curve (see [5]). The topology of the reduced orbit—
and thus the classiﬁcation of the physical motion—is found to depend on the
magnitude of e′ or e′′.

Fig. (1) is a summary of the classiﬁcation of orbits arising from variation of e′
and e′′. For a proof of the properties discussed here, see ref. [5]. From the three
panels of the diagram, it may be seen that the Type I solutions correspond to
an attractive Coulomb interaction, whereas Type II corresponds to a repulsive
potential. For the Type I solutions, the eﬀect of the transformation e′
e′ is a
reﬂection of the curve across the (∆x, ∆y) plane, and thus one need consider only

generalization of hyperbolic Kepler solutions. The boundary case e′ = 1 is

bound at ρ

two branches. Solutions in the range e′′

diﬀerentiable at φ = (0, π) and thus may be considered unphysical. Likewise the
general solution e′, e′′
= 0 appears to be unphysical on the same grounds based
on numerical investigation [5]. The Type I solutions were found by Cook [3]
who discussed only the bound case. The bound Type I orbits were also derived
by Piron and Reuse [4] by a transformation out of the center-of-mass rest frame
to one in which ∆t(τ )

0.

The most interesting feature of the solutions is the fact that the perihelion
of the bound two-body system does not precess. This follows from the fact that
the bound orbit of any central potential is a closed curve [5]. This is contrary to
the prediction of a ﬁnite precession made by Sommerfeld [7] using the Heaviside-
Lorentz equations in the one-body limit, i.e., inﬁnite mass of the source. This
latter precession is entirely special relativistic, and in the case of gravitation, the
Sommerfeld rate is exactly one-sixth the rate predicted by general relativity for
the same planetary masses. Sommerfeld proved that the nonvanishing perihe-
lion precession results in the “correct” ﬁne structure hydrogen spectrum under
the rule of semi-classical quantization [7]. This result has become questionable,
however, and it is generally regarded today as incorrect [12]. This judgment is
based primarily on the fact that in the full quantum theory, ﬁne structure is
known to arise intimately from the spin of the electron [13], which has no clas-
sical counterpart. One should expect, therefore, that in the classical limit, the
special relativistic two-body system should not undergo perihelion precession.
It is interesting to impose the rule of semi-classical quantization on the bound
Type I solutions above. In the case of the hydrogen atom, one should expect the
result to be the Bohr prediction without ﬁne structure corrections. Since the
energy spectrum is a function of the separation of energy states, it is possible
to continue to ignore the energy of the center-of-mass and to proceed by the
reduced problem alone.

First it is necessary to solve the covariant Hamilton-Jacobi equation to obtain
the invariant action variables. As in the Lagrangian version above, many of the
results are valid generally for the conservative potential V = V (ρ). Following
Goldstein [11], ch. 10, it is useful to set aside for the moment the knowledge
that the system can be reduced in dimensionality. Using the 3+1-dimensional
Lagrangian in (4), the canonically conjugate momenta are

Hamilton’s characteristic function S is assumed here to be totally separable,
i.e., in the form S = Sρ + Sβ + Sθ + Sφ. This allows one to solve eq. (13) by a
procedure which is a generalization of the nonrelativistic method for the central
force problem [11], i.e., using the invariant separation constants, (αφ, αθ, αβ, E)
[5]. This procedure yields the solutions

The action variables are given by Jρ =

Jφ = 2παφ and Jθ = 2π (αθ −

nonrelativistic one for r, and thus the identical method of contour integration
is used [11], yielding

The angular frequencies, which are given by the rule νρ = ∂K/∂Jρ, etc., are
therefore identical. Thus it is proved what was asserted above, namely that the
bound orbits of the central force potential are closed.

The rule of semi-classical quantization stipulates that Jρ = nρh, etc., where
the quantum numbers (nρ, nβ, nθ, nφ) take on integer values and where h is
Planck’s constant. From eq. (16), the semi-classical energy levels in the case of

Assuming that k represents the electrostatic interaction strength between the
proton and electron, the prediction of the St¨uckelberg special relativistic two-
body theory gives the Bohr levels without ﬁne structure corrections, which is
the correct result in the case of no spin.

3 Comments on the Coordinate System

−

The pseudospherical coordinates eqs. (3) used in this paper are those used by
Cook [3] to study several two-body systems, including the inverse-square poten-
tial V =
k/ρ. These coordinates may be contrasted with the alternate set of
pseudospherical coordinates used by Arshansky and Horwitz [14] to solve the
full quantum St¨uckelberg model of the hydrogen atom with no spin. Although
Cook claimed to have found in the full quantum case an incorrect n + 1/2 de-
pendence of the hydrogen spectrum on the principal quantum number n, this
result is obtained by using an electromagnetic retarded potential approximated
for low particle acceleration (cf. eq. (81) on p. 133 of ref. ([3]). The inverse-
k/ρ studied here is discussed by Cook only in the purely
square potential V =
classical context, as a possible special relativistic gravitational solution. He
used the bound two-body solutions he obtained for this potential to study high-
order deviations from Newtonian motion in the Solar System orbits. The lack
of perihelion precession discussed here is implicit in his work.

−

Regarding the lack of ﬁne structure corrections for the system without spin,
the semi-classical prediction obtained in this paper is in agreement with the
full quantum St¨uckelberg result for this potential obtained by Arshansky and
Horwitz using the alternate pseudospherical coordinates. In the purely classical
case, the diﬀerence between the two coordinate systems is trivial, since the two
sets are identical in 2+1 dimensions. In the quantum case, it may be possible to
distinguish between the two coordinate systems based on the support required
for the reduced wave function (see ref. [14]).

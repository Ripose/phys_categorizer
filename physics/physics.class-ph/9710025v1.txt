Abstract

In this paper we analyze the physical meaning of sub- and superluminal soliton-like so-
lutions (as the X-waves) of the relativistic wave equations and of some non-trivial solutions
of the free Schr¨odinger equations for which the concepts of phase and group velocities have

a diﬀerent meaning than in the case of plane wave solutions. If we accept the strict validity

of the principle of relativity, such solutions describe objects of two essentially diﬀerent na-

ture: carrying energy wave packets and inertia-free properly phase vibrations. Speeds of the
ﬁrst-type objects can exceed the plane wave velocity c∗ only inside media and is always less
then the vacuum light speed c. Particularly, very fast sound pulses with speeds c∗ < v < c
have already been launched. The second-type objects are incapable of caring energy and

information but have superluminal speed.

If we admit the possibility of a breakdowns of

Lorentz invariance, pulses described, for example, by superluminal solutions of the Maxwell

equations can be generated. Only experiment will give the ﬁnal answer.

1. INTRODUCTION

As it is known (see, e. g., [1] for a review and references) the hypothesis of faster-
than-light bodies (tachyons) contradicts drastically the causality principle if we suppose

1

the strict validity of the principle relativity. One of the logical contradictions which
exists in the standard formulation of the tachyon theory is that accepting the validity
of the principle of relativity for faster-than-light bodies permits us in some situations
to send informations to the past. E. Recami argued [2, 3] that situations like that
never occurs in reality, however, his arguments are not very convincing as discussed
by many authors (see the review [1]). The second serious diﬃculty of tachyon theories
is the impossibility of a non-contradictory superluminal generalization of the Lorentz
transformations what is necessary for any consistent description of the tachyon kine-
matics [4].

Meanwhile tachyon-like objects appear in various string models, in theories with
high-order lagrangians, by supersymmetric generalizations. Many authors are of the
opinion that this fact is not only a disappointing theoretical failure and think that
an improvement of our view of the universe that produces a space-time model com-
patible with superluminal phenomena and free of logical contradictions is necessary.
Researches in this direction can be found, e.g., in papers [2, 6].

There are now many strict mathematical investigations proving the existence of
families of non-dispersive wave packets propagating in homogeneous media even in
vacuum, with arbitrary superluminal speed v > c = 3.1010cm/s (see, e.g., pa-
[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] and, especially, a review [14]) 1. Such packets corre-
pers
spond to solutions of the homogeneous wave equations, Klein-Gordon, Dirac, Weyl
and Maxwell equations which are, dispersion-free, i. e. in contrast to the usual wave
packets made of superpositions of plane waves they don’t spread even in media and,
therefore, can be considered as completely independent space-time localized material
objects (”wave torpedos”, purely electromagnetic particles etc.). We call these kind of
solutions ”undistorted progressive waves” (UPWs), a name suggested in [13, 14] and
which seems to the authors to correctly express the essence of their nature.

It is important to emphasize that like the plane-wave solutions of the relativistic
wave equations UPWs have inﬁnite energy. However, it is possible to exhibit arbitrary

superposition of UPWs, in particular, in some cases using the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld
theory of diﬀraction, it is possible to obtain ﬁnite aperture approximations (FAA) to
a given solution of the relativistic wave equations that have ﬁnite energy [13, 14]. One
can verify also that such ﬁnite energy solutions (subluminal, luminal or superluminal)

are quasi-undistorted progressive waves (QUPWs). For the QUPWs solutions of the
Maxwell equations it can be proved that they decay into solutions travelling with the
usual light speed c. In this sense QUPWs looks like instable particles.

The existence of QUPWs-type solutions for the case of sound has been proved by
J.-Y. Lu and J. E. Greenleaf [12]. The existence of QUPWs satisfying eq. (1.1) and
traveling with speeds either v < c∗ or v > c∗ where c∗, called speed of sound, is a
characteristic of the properties of the medium, e.g., the temperature, Young modulus,
etc, is proved also experimentally [14, 15] 2.

It is very important for all considerations that follows to take into account the fol-
lowing. Usually the velocity of propagation of energy of a wave satisfying the equation

(1.1)

where Φ(t, x) is the pressure at the point x at the time t is deﬁned as

2Φ = 0,

ve = S/u.

Here S is the momentum ﬂux and u is the energy density given by

S =

Φ∂Φ/∂t,

u = (1/2)[(

Φ)2 + (1/c2

∗)(∂Φ/∂t)2].

(1.3)

∇

∇

From these expressions it follows that

One can easily prove that for plane waves ve = c∗ indeed. However, the acoustic
experiments described in the papers [14, 15] show that the FAA to the limited band
sound X-wave travels with a speed v > c∗. This speed is also the speed of the propa-
gation of the energy carried by the wave, since the hydrophone located at a distance d
from the transducer is activated by the energy carried by the wave at a time t = d/v
after the launching of the wave at a moment t = 0. It means that the deﬁnition (1.2)
is devoid of sense. For the case of the FAA to the limited band sound X-wave the
speed ve is a complicated function of (x, t), so we must be careful when discussing the
velocity of a propagation of energy of UPWs and QUPWs solutions, particularly, of
Maxwell equations.

2In the experiments the so-called X-wave packet travels only with speed 0.2441(8)% greater than
c∗ should be

c∗ and skeptics can have doubts. A new experiments with QUPWs having speeds V
done. Such ”superfast waves”, especially in water, are of great practical importance.

From the viewpoint of current quantum theory a sound wave is composed of phonons
and excitations that travel in the medium with speed c∗. The problem of understanding
the acoustic waves travelling with speeds v < c∗ or v > c∗ using quantum ﬁeld theory
will be analyzed in another paper where we show that they correspond to a new kind
of boson condensate.

Another important remark is necessary to be emphasized here. The superlumi-
nal UPWs or QUPWs solutions of the free Maxwell equations share with the above
mentioned classical tachyons only the property that both travel with speed v > c.
The analogy ends here because any classical tachyon is a material object (an elemen-
tary particle, a macroscopic body) whose Lorentz change of the longitudinal dimension
in the laboratory frame is deﬁned by the cut of the tachyon world tube by a plane
t = constant. Since tachyons are always moving we can write

L(v)/L(v′) = (v2/c2

1)1/2/(v′2/c2

1)1/2.

(1.5)

This means that the tachyon mass and energy distributions in the laboratory frame
must be ellipsoidal also, but in contrast to the case of subluminal bodies instead of
a contraction the mass and energy distributions will show a dilation which increases
with the tachyon speed v [16]. It diﬀers essentially from the X-like form of some UPWs
or QUPWs solutions of the wave equation. The conclusion about X-like shape of the
moving tachyons obtained by E. Recami [2] is a consequence of the formal Lorentz
transformation to the laboratory frame from a superluminal reference frame. However,
as mentioned above, such a transformation is contradictory. So, the coincidence of
the tachyon shape predicted by E. Recami with the X-wave solutions of the Maxwell
equations should be considered as accidental and doesn’t prove the breakdown of the
well known relativistic shape change law for the tachyons.

After these remarks we complete the introduction by saying that the main purpose
of our paper is to analyze the physical meaning of the various wave velocities that
appear (i) in some extraordinary solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation (Section 2), (ii)
in the case of UPWs v > c∗ solutions of the wave equation for sound waves (Section 3)
and (iii) in UPWs v > c solutions of the free Maxwell equations (Section 4) where, in
particular, we analyze the energy velocity paradox quoted by W. Band [9].

Obviously, with the analysis of the superluminal electromagnetic UPWs in Section
4 we are not proving that it is sure that such waves can be launched in physical space,
and, of course, if we believe in the strict validity of the principle of relativity which
is one of the main dogmas of current physics, to launch a ”wave torpedo” with v > c

4

is impossible. Nevertheless the detailed computer simulation to the ﬁnite aperture
approximation to the superluminal electromagnetic waves presented in the paper [14]
suggests that it is worth to try the experiment. Sure, if the FAA to a given superlu-
minal electromagnetic wave can be launched, we will see a breakdown of the principle
relativity as it is known today, thus determining the limits of validity of the special
theory of relativity.

2. NON-DISPERSIVE SOLUTIONS OF SCHR ¨ODINGER EQUATION

In dealing with waves we have several velocities involved, e. g., phase and group
velocities, velocity of transport of energy, signal speed, front velocity etc... Of course,
the meaning of all these quantities depends on the particular theory to which the wave
motion is associated. In order to reveal their relations more clear let us take the case
of non-relativistic quantum mechanics where a free particle has associated to a wave
function Ψ satisfying the equation

i¯h

∂Ψ
∂t

+

¯h2
2m∇

2Ψ = 0.

Now, if the particle is moving with the kinetic energy E = mv2/2 and the momentum
p = mvz, then the associated wave function in the solution of eq. (2.1) given by the
plane wave

Ψ = Aei(ωt−kz)

with A is a constant and

E = ¯hω = mv2/2,

p = ¯hk = mv

The function Ψ is simultaneously eigenfunction of energy and momentum operators:

ˆEΨ

≡

(i¯h∂/∂t)Ψ = ¯hωΨ,

ˆp

Ψ = (

i¯h∂/∂z)Ψ = ¯hkΨ.

(2.4)

−

The connection between ω and k in order for eq. (2.2) to be a solution of eq. (2.1)
gives the dispersion relation

The phase and group velocities associated with Ψ are

ω = ¯hk2/2m.

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.5)

(2.6)

vph = v/2,

vg = dω/dk = v

5

and we see that for plane waves the speed of the particle is equal to vg.

Now, as it well known, the function Ψ given by eq. (2.2) is not an element of the
H describing a

Hilbert space (H) of wave functions. A probability wave Ψ(z, t)
particle moving with speed v = vz is given by the wave packet

Ψ(z, t) = A

Z

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

where B(k) is a weight function centered in ko and decaying rapidly outside the interval
∆k < k < ko + ∆k. For Ψ given by eq.(2.7) the group velocity is deﬁned by
ko −

vg = (dω/dk)ko.

The function Ψ is than interpreted as associated with a particle moving with expecta-
tion kinetic energy and momentum

The important point to be emphasized here is that Ψ is a spreading wave packet,
and the question naturally arises here: are there any non-spreading wave packets which
are solutions of Schr¨odinger equation? If the answer is positive, which is the meaning
of such solutions?

If we solve eq. (2.1) in cylindrical co-ordinates for a wave moving along the z-axis,

we immediately get a family of solutions

ΨJn = AneinθJn(αρ)ei(kz−ωt),

(2.10)

where An is a constant, ρ = (x2 + y2)1/2 and α is the so-called separation constant what
means that α is not a function of (x, t) but, of course, it may be a general function of
k, ω and other parameters.

In what follows let us consider for simplicity the solution with n = 0.
The dispersion relation

ω =

(k2 + α2)

¯h
2m

(2.11)

must hold in order for the function ΨJo to be a solution of eq. (2.1). To interpret the
physical meaning of this relation we recall that ΨJo is a simultaneous eigenfunction of
ˆE and ˆp. Indeed, we have

ˆEΨJo = ¯hωΨJo = EΨJo,

ˆpΨJo = ¯hkΨJo = pΨJo.

(2.12)

Then, we may write

where we put

E =

(k2 + α2) =

+ mc2,

p = ¯hk

¯h2
2m

¯h2

m = ¯hα/√2c

interpreted as the mass of the particle. We have then, as usual, the particle, phase and
group velocities

v = p/m = ¯hk/m = √2ck/α,

vph = ω/k,

vg = dω/dk = v

(2.15)

Let us now introduce, following J.-Y. Lu and J. F. Greenleaf [15], the axicon angle

Taking into account now the relation between α and m, given by the eq. (2.14) we

have

where ξ is determined by the dispersion relation (2.11) as

k = ωξ cos η, α = ωξ sin η

ξ = (2m/¯hω)1/2 = √2c−1 sin η.

Then we have for the velocities in the eq. (2.15:

ω = mc2/¯h sin2 η

v = √2c cot η

vph = vg = √2c/ sin 2η = v/2 cos2 η

In contrast to the plane wave solution here vph = vg, but in general vg 6
this, as the Schr¨odinger equation is a non-relativistic,

(2.23)

The interpretation of the velocities are now clear. If we want that ΨJo describes a
free particle moving with the speed v, then we cannot attach a physical meaning to
vph or vg, i. e. in this case the transport of energy will not be given by vg.

(2.24)

which is, obviously, dispersive solution of eq. (2.1) if we consider the mass (2.14) as
a constant, because in this case the axicon angle η and, respectively, the velocities
(2.19), (2.20) are frequency dependent. In this connection it should be noted that the
results presented in the paper [17] claiming the existence of X-wave solutions for the
Schr¨odinger equation are seen unfortunately to be incorrect for analogous reasons.

In a paper [18] A. Barut tried to construct non-dispersive solutions of the

tionary solution of eq.(2.1) of the form

then putting Ψ into eq. (2.1) we see that the function f (x) satisﬁes the Helmholtz
diﬀerential equation

with α = mc/¯h.

A simple solution of this equation in spherical coordinates is sin αr/r where r =
(x2 + y2 + z2)1/2. Then, really a non-dispersive packet exist which is stationary in the
laboratory frame and is given by

Ψ(x, t) = e−imc2t/2¯hf (x)

2f (x) + α2f (x) = 0

Ψ(x, t) =

e−imc2t/2¯h.

It is clear that Ψ(x, t) given by eq. (2.27) is not an eigenfunction of the momentum

operator, but, nevertheless, it is an eigenfunction of the energy operator.

A. Barut claims to have constructed a non-dispersive wave packet solution of the

Schr¨odinger equation by ﬁrst writing

where the function ψ(x, t) satisﬁes the equation

∂f (ξ)/∂t = 0.

This equation has a solution only when v = 0 which, particularly, produces as a possible
solution our stationary wave packet given by eq. (2.27).

We can think that an X-wave solution of Schr¨odinger equation can be constructed
by relaxing the condition that α in eq. (2.13) is a constant. Unfortunately even in
this case a simple calculation shows that there is no such a solution. Nevertheless, it is
worth to try to construct ion beams with the wave function like that given in eq. (2.10)
in an experiment analogous to a light experiment by Durnin [8] but using instead of
an optical lens a magnetic one.

3. UPWs SOLUTIONS OF THE WAVE EQUATION

The solution of the homogenous wave equation in cylindrical coordinates has the

same form (2.10) but with the diﬀerent dispersion relation

Consider a quantum mechanical meaning for these expressions. If we write E = ¯hω

and pz = c∗c−1¯hk then

We see that the massless wave equation has solutions propagating with phase and
group velocities (3.5), and v would be the velocity of a excitation-like particle with the
mass depending on the frequency:

m = ¯hc∗c−1ω sin η.

Using relations (2.10) and (3.5), one can build the packet

ΦXn = Aneinθ

which moves rigidly, without any distortion:

(3.7)

ΦXn(x, y, z, t) = ΦXn(x, y, z

(c∗/ cos η)t, 0).

(3.8)

−

We remark that the packet ΦXn, if interpreted, for example, as a classical sound
wave, has inﬁnite energy. However, a ﬁnite approximation to ΦXn with an appropriate
function B(ω) has been seen to travel with the speed c∗/ cos η [14]. Thus, for this
case, as said in Section 1, this is the velocity of propagation of the wave energy — a
non-trivial fact showing again that the interpretation of the velocities associated to a
wave depends on the theory, that the wave is supposed to describe.

From the quantum-mechanical point of view sound is composed of phonons. ΨXn
is a kind of ﬁeld conﬁguration deﬁning a new kind of boson condensate. This will be
studied later.

4. SUPERLUMINAL WAVE PACKETS

If c∗ = c the homogenous wave equations have superluminal solutions with vph =
vg > c (see eq.(3.5)). As shown in [13, 14] such solutions exist also for massive Dirac
and Klein-Gordon particles. If we strictly believe in the presently known relativistic
physics these superluminal packets, of course, cannot be generated. What, however, is
the physical meaning of such faster-than-light solutions in this case?

Solutions of this kind describe inertia-free processes like, for example, a neon adver-
tisement string where each letter ﬂashes independently of the preceding one. Neither
information nor energy is transferred in these processes and the problem concerning
the velocity of energy transport simply doesn’t exist here.

A superluminal electromagnetic beam can be launched in physical space with a
boundary, like in W. Band’s gedanken experiment [9] where a charged cylinder with an

10

appropriate charge density is used. Band’s solution with vg > c describes an inertia-
free process if we change the charge of each tiny cylinder segment (”switch” it up) quite
independently according to Band’s solution. One should say that the situation is here
quite clear, again there is no transfer of information and energy, and Band’s problem
/u < 1 (of Poynting vector over energy density) is trivially no
concerning the ratio
problem at all.

S

As we said already in the Introduction, the “mathematical experiments” done in [14]
for the electromagnetic X-waves solutions of free Maxwell equations seem, however, to
indicate that eventually these waves can be generated with appropriate antennas. Of
course, if this really can be done we will ﬁnd a violation of the principle of relativity.

5. CONCLUSIONS

We see that both the sub- and superluminal non dispersive soliton-like solutions of
the homogeneous linear relativistic equations describe physical situations that can be
realized in practice. For superluminal solutions there is surely a real transfer of energy
and information, superluminal wave packets describe inertia-free processes without any
transfer. Nevertheless it remains to verify if real, i. e. energy transferring, faster-than-
light electromagnetic pulses suggested by mathematical simulation can be launched.
The properties of UPWs are so extraordinary that only experiment can decide, and if
such beams exist then we have a ﬁrst case of a breakdown of the current form of the
theory of relativity.

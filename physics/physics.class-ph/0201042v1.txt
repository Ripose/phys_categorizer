The change of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in a particular place due to the event of a change in the
motion of a charged particle can occur only after the light signal from the event can reach this place.
Naive calculations of the electromagnetic energy and the work performed by the electromagnetic
ﬁelds might lead to paradoxes of apparent non-conservation of energy. A few paradoxes of this type
for a simple motion of two charges are presented and resolved in a quantitative way providing deeper
insight into various relativistic eﬀects in the classical electromagnetic theory.

Starting from Einstein’s work on special relativity1
it became clear that classical electromagnetic theory is
consistent with relativity, and no true paradoxes can be
found. However, several apparent paradoxes have been
extensively discussed and these discussions enriched our
understanding of the electromagnetic theory. Some of
these controversial topics are: hidden momentum2, Feyn-
man’s disk3, Trouton-Noble Experiment4, and the 4/3
factor for the self energy of an electron.5 Here we present
another situation which, analyzed in a naive way, leads
to paradoxical conclusions. The paradoxes are relevant
to recent discussions of covariance in the electromagnetic
theory6,7,8,9,10.

Let us start with the paradox which is simplest to
present; its resolution will be shown at the end of the
paper.
Paradox I

There are two particles of charge q initially separated
by distance l. We consider two ways to bring the par-
ticles, initially and ﬁnally at rest, to a shorter distance
l − x, see Fig. 1.

(i) We move one particle the distance x toward the

other particle. The work required for this is:

W i = UN EW − UOLD =

.

(1)

(ii) We move both particles toward each other for the
distance x/2. We do it simultaneously and fast enough
such that the motion of each particle ends before the
signal about this motion can reach the location of the
other particle. In this case, the work should be the sum of
the amounts of work performed by external forces exerted

cesses: (i) one particle moves, (ii) two particles move.

After the procedure is ended, we obtain the same sit-
uation in both cases, but we applied less work when we
moved both particles: W ii < W i.

We can get the energy equal to the work W i back from
the system when we reverse the process (i), moving one
of the charges to the original distance l.
We can repeat the cycle of process (ii) followed by re-
versed process (i) gaining every time the amount of en-
ergy:

W i − W ii ≈

q2x2
2l3 .

(3)

Of course, there must be an error in the above argu-
ment. We have not taken all relevant eﬀects into account.
However, before explaining this paradox we present and
resolve a few other apparent paradoxes demonstrating
the relevance of various eﬀects. In Section II we present
and in Section III resolve a paradox based upon part of
the process (ii) described above. Instead of starting with
particles at rest, accelerating, moving with some veloc-
ity, and then bringing the particles to rest, we start with
the two particles moving with constant velocity and com-
ing to rest at diﬀerent times. In Section IV we further
analyze the setup of Paradox II obtaining and resolving
another paradox. Section V explains the same point us-
ing an example of a large number of charged particles. In
Section VI we consider remaining part of the processes in-
volved in Paradox I: accelerating a pair of particles from
rest. In Section VII we consider acceleration of particles
moving in parallel. This setup leads to a paradox the res-
olution of which is due to yet another surprising eﬀect.
In Section VIII we return to the analysis of Paradox I
and resolve it in a quantitative way.

where W1 and W2 are the works due to the forces the
particles exert during the process of stopping; ˜W is the
work performed by the particle moving with velocity v
during the time that the other particle is at rest (for
t > 0, the work ˜W is performed by particle 2 and for
t < 0, by particle 1). Of course, no work is performed
when both particles are at rest, and, also, the net work
vanishes during the time when both particles are moving
with velocity v.

For making relativistic analysis more convenient, we
include the rest mass energy. Then, the ﬁnal energy of
the system is

where x is the change in the distance between the charges:

Ef in = 2mc2 +

q2
l − x

,

x = vt.

The distance might decrease or increase (negative t and
x) depending on which particle stopped ﬁrst.

When a particle moves with constant velocity, the to-
tal force exerted on it is zero. Therefore, the force it
exerts on an external system is equal to the electromag-
netic force the other particle exerts on it. Since, in the
laboratory frame, the distance between the particles is l,
in the Lorentz frame at which the charges are at rest, the
1 − v2/c2).
distance between them is γl (where γ ≡ 1/
The Lorentz transformation for the force in the x direc-
tion between the rest frame and the laboratory frame is
Fx = F ′
x and, therefore, the forces the particles exert on
the external systems are:

ENERGY FOR TWO STOPPING PARTICLES

Thus, the work ˜W is:

F1x = −F2x =

q2
(γl)2 .

˜W = −

q2x
(γl)2 .

This formula is correct both for x > 0, when the work
is done by particle 2, and for x < 0, when the work is
done by particle 1. Thus, the equation of conservation of
energy (5) becomes

(9)

Consider two particles of charge q and mass m located
on the x axis at the separation l and moving in the x
direction with a constant velocity v. At time t1 = 0 we
stop the ﬁrst particle and at time t2 = t we stop the
second particle: see Fig. 2. The time t is small enough
such that signals about the change of the velocity of one
particle cannot reach the location of the other, while it
is still moving:

−l
c − v

< t <

l
c + v

.

(4)

We also require that τ , the time of “stopping” a particle,
is small: τ ≪ |t|.

Let us consider conservation of energy for this process.
The initial energy should be equal to the ﬁnal energy
plus the work of the forces which the particles exert on
external systems:

The initial energy Ein obviously does not depend on x.
Due to causality argument, the works W1 and W2 do not
depend on x either. The equation of energy has only
two terms depending on x. Therefore, Eq. (10) repre-
sents a paradox: it must be true for all x in the interval
[ −lv
lv
c+v ] (corresponding to (4)), but it cannot, since it
c−v ,
has only two terms depending on x which do not balance
each other.

The radiation of the stopping charge propagates inside
a spherical shell of width cτ and the energy ﬂux S is given
by:11

S =

q2a2 sin2 θ
4πc3r2

ˆr,

where r is the radius of the shell and θ speciﬁes the di-
rection relative to the x axis in our setup. Since we have
two accelerated charges, the radiation ﬁeld due to the
two charges will interfere in the region of the overlap, see
Fig. 3. The complete overlap will take place for the angle
θ deﬁned by:

(16)

Since the width of the shells is cτ , the overlap will be

which is obtained from

Due to the interference, the total energy radiated in the
direction of the overlap is twice as much as if the two
charges were radiating separately. At the interval [(θ −
δθ), (θ + δθ)] the overlap increases and then decreases
linearly. Therefore, the interference term of the radiation

In Paradox II, according to our naive calculation, the
ﬁnal energy together with the obtained work had two
terms depending on x, the change in the distance between
the particles, which do not sum up to a constant. There
is cancellation of the x dependence in the ﬁrst order of
the parameter x
l ∼ v
c , therefore, the leading term of the
unbalanced x dependent term is q2x2

l3 . Indeed,

(11)

The process of stopping cannot be arbitrarily slow since
it had to be ﬁnished before the signal about stopping the
other particle can arrive. Moreover, we choose τ ≪ |t|.
Therefore, we should expect a signiﬁcant contribution
due to radiation which we have not taken into account.
The charges accelerate during the process of stopping and
the magnitude of the acceleration is a = v
τ . According
to the Larmor formula, the total energy radiated by a
single charge during the whole process of stopping is

R1 = R2 =

(12)

(13)

The x dependent term which we have to balance is much

≪

.

However, everything that happens at the close vicinity of
the charges cannot depend on x, and, in particular, the
radiation which each charge emits does not depend on x,
so how can the radiation energy balance the x dependent
terms in the equation of conservation of energy? The
eﬀect is due to the interference of radiation. The total
radiated energy is

Rtot = R1 + R2 + Rint.

(14)

The interference term Rint depends on x and restores the
balance. Now we will show this in detail.

Fig. 3. Electromagnetic radiation of the two stopping par-
ticles. The area of constructive interference of the radiation
ﬁeld is painted in black.

After expressing sin2 θ = 1 − sin2(θ − π
2 ), using (16), and
making an approximation up to the lowest order in the
parameter x

c , we obtain:

l ≈ v

Rint =

(20)

Thus, we have shown that (at least up to a second or-
der in the parameter v
c , the precision to which we made
our calculations) the equation of conservation of energy
which takes into account the electromagnetic radiated
energy does not have x dependence. The corrected equa-
tion of conservation of energy (which replaces Eq. 5),

Ein = Ef in + W1 + W2 + ˜W + Rtot,

(21)

leads, after the approximation, to the expression which
does not exhibit x dependence:

Ein = 2mc2 + W1 + W2 + R1 + R2 +

. (22)

Thus we have resolved Paradox II with regard to the
unbalanced x dependence. But can we show that the LHS
and the RHS of the equation of conservation of energy
(22) are equal? We will analyze this in the next section.
The paradox of non-conservation of energy of the sys-
tem of two charged particles when radiation is neglected
has been considered in another example.12 The calcula-
tion of the scattering on the basis of the Coulomb forces
yields an energy of the charged particles after the colli-
sion that is larger than the initial energy. The advantage
of the scattering example is that no external forces have
to be taken into account. However, the resolution of this
paradox by taking into account radiation has been shown
only qualitatively.13

IV. LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION FOR
ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY

Without knowing the mass and without knowing the
local works W1 and W2 it seems that we cannot test (22).
However, we can test the consistency of this equation of
conservation of energy with single-particle conservation
of energy equations. We can write down the conservation
of energy for each particle assuming that it performs ex-
actly the same motion (stopping from velocity v during
the time τ ) in case the other particle is not present. We
can argue that the local works Wi and the emitted radi-
ations Ri are the same as in the original example.

This argument is not as strong as the causality argu-
ment, i.e. the independence of x of the values of these
variables, but it seems that since we can take the time τ
of the local processes very small, the eﬀect of the external
ﬁeld can be neglected. In order to reduce any doubt that
this is a valid approach, we will consider, in the next sec-
tion, a similar situation with a large number of charged
particles. It exhibits the same problem, but we will not
need this assumption.

4

Our approach to ﬁnding the initial energy is ﬁnding
the total energy of the two charges in their rest frame
E0 and multiplying it by the factor γ. In the rest frame
of the moving particles, the distance between them is γl.
Therefore, the total initial energy of the particles is:

Ein = γ

2mc2 +

(cid:18)

q2
γl (cid:19)

.

(23)

Thus, the equation of conservation of energy (22) be-
comes

v2

(24)

.

of conservation of energy:

γmc2 = mc2 + W1 + R1,
γmc2 = mc2 + W2 + R2.

(25)

But when we subtract these equations from the two-
particle conservation of energy equation (24) we see that
there is inconsistency: the term q2v2
is unbalanced! The
lc2
inconsistency does not follow from the approximations we
made in deriving (22). The algebraic approximations can
be made irrelevant if we consider simultaneous stopping
of the charges corresponding to x = 0, in which case
(22) follows without approximation. We have reached
another paradox. There must be another error in our
analysis. (In fact, this paradox will appear also for large
|x| when there is no interference of radiation; such a case
will be considered in the next section.)

The paradox arises from the error which we made in
Eq. (23). We have claimed that if the total energy of
a system of charges in their rest frame is E0, then its
energy in the Lorentz frame in which the system moves
with velocity v is

E = γE0.

(26)

Equation (26) is, of course, correct when the system is an
elementary particle. It is also true when the system is a
ﬁnite stationary isolated body. But it is, in general, not
true for a composite system with external forces such as
the system of charged particles we consider here.

In order to obtain the correct transformation of the
electromagnetic energy from the rest frame to the mov-
ing frame, we consider two charges connected by a rigid
rod. The energy of the whole system, charges and the
rod, does transform according to (26). Therefore, the
anomalous term of the transformation of the electromag-
netic energy equals to the negative of the anomalous part
of the mechanical energy of the rod. The latter is easier
to calculate and we will do it now.

In order to calculate the expression for transformation
of energy of the rod, we express it as a volume integral
of the energy density u:

Ein =

udv,

Z

(27)

and use the Lorentz transformation for the energy den-
sity, the 00 component of the energy-stress tensor:

(28)

where S is the energy ﬂux and σ is the stress tensor. The
transformation of the energy due to the the ﬁrst term
leads to the usual expression (26): the energy density
is multiplied by γ2, but due to the Lorentz contraction
the volume is multiplied by the factor γ−1. The second
term does not contribute since the energy ﬂux in the
rest frame vanishes. Therefore, the last term contributes
the anomalous term. The tension in the rod prevents
the charges, separated by the distance γl, from moving,
q2
therefore it equals
γ2l2 . Thus, in the rest frame of the
rod, the stress tensor component is:

′
σ
xx =

q2

(29)

where s is the cross-section of the rod. Therefore, the
contribution to the energy in the laboratory frame due
to the tension of the rod is:

(30)

Thus, the correct expression for the initial energy of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld of the two charges (including the
anomalous term of the transformation of the electromag-
netic energy which equals to the negative of that of the
mechanical energy) is:

Ein = γ

x axis. The ﬁrst particle stops at t1 = 0 during a short
time τ . The second particle stops in the same manner at
t2 = t, the latest possible moment such that the infor-
mation about stopping of the ﬁrst particle cannot reach
it. This corresponds to

x = vt =

vl
c + v

.

The third particle stops in the same way at time t3 = 2t
just before the information about the stopping of the
ﬁrst two should arrive, the particle n stops at time tn =
(n − 1)t, etc. until the stopping of the last particle. This
is illustrated in Fig. 4.

One diﬀerence from the case of two particles is that,
due to the particular choice of x, we have no interference
of radiation from diﬀerent charges. The overlap of the
radiation ﬁelds takes place only on the x axis where the
intensity is zero. Another change from the case of two
particles to the case of N is reﬂected in the calculations of
the initial and ﬁnal potential energies, the work ˜W (the
work made by particles during motion with constant ve-
locity), and the anomalous energy transformation term:
in all these terms appear the factor η:

The appearance of the factor η is obvious for potential
energy, since q

i is the energy of bringing the par-
γl
ticle number n + 1 when there are n particles in the row.
Let us show that the same factor appears for ˜W . When
all particles move with velocity v, no net work is done
on the system and, of course, no net work is done when
all particles are at rest. Consider forces between particle
n and all particles i to the right of it, (i.e., i < n). The
distance the particle n moves while i is at rest is (n − i)x,
and the force between them is
(γl(n−i))2 . Therefore, the
contribution to ˜W due to the interaction between particle
n and particle i is

V. CONSERVATION OF ENERGY FOR N
STOPPING PARTICLES

In this section we can strengthen the arguments of the
previous section by considering a large number of charged
particles in a row. In this case, we do not subtract single-
particle equations of conservations of energy from the N -
particle equation of conservation of energy. Thus, we do
not need the assumption of the previous section that the
terms of single-particle equations are equal to the cor-
responding terms of the N -particle equation. However,
since this section does not describe conceptually new ef-
fects, it can be omitted on the ﬁrst reading.

Consider a chain of a large number N of identical par-
ticles of charge q and mass m separated by the distance
l one from the other, all moving with velocity v on the

We obtain that the contribution to the potential energy
due to the forces between particle n and all particles i
such that i < n is:

Instead of performing a direct calculation of the

Consider a rod with N charges separated by distance
N −1
n=1 Tnl is equal to the
l at rest. We will show that
potential energy of the charges. Since the latter is mul-
tiplied by η in the transition from 2 to N , the former is
multiplied by η too. Potential energy is equal to the work
which electromagnetic forces will do in the process of uni-
form extension of the length of the rod from (N − 1)l to a
very large length, which, in turn, is equal to the negative
of the mechanical work made by the tension forces of the
rod. When the separation between the charges is ˜l, the
tension in the parts of the rod can be expressed as

Tn(˜l) = Tn(l)

l2
˜l2

,

(38)

because this tension compensates the Coulomb force pro-
portional to ˜l−2. Therefore, the work (equal to the po-
tential energy) can, indeed, be expressed as

Now we can write the equation of conservation of en-

RHS is the modiﬁcation of the RHS of (10)):

(41)
(We omitted N , since it is negligible relative to N ln N ).
Since for large N we have η ≫ N , all terms in (40)
which do not have the factor η can be neglected. These
include all terms Wn, the amount of work obtained in the
process of stopping particle n. Indeed, for small enough
τ , these terms will not have strong dependence on N and,
therefore, their sum will be approximately proportional
to N . After substitution of (32), our choice of x, we can
see that the equation of energy with the anomalous trans-
formation term is balanced in the leading η proportional
terms (and it is not balanced if we use the transformation
of energy (26)).

VI. ACCELERATING PARTICLES FROM REST

In order to prepare ourselves for the analysis of Para-
dox I presented in the Introduction, let us consider a step
which has not been discussed yet: the acceleration of the
two charged particles from rest to velocity v. Of course,
in the frame of reference moving with velocity v, this is
deceleration and stopping of particles moving with equal
velocities, the process we analyzed above. However, the
transformation from one frame to another might be a
diﬃcult task and, as in many other examples14,15, an
analysis in a diﬀerent Lorentz frame allows seeing new
physical phenomena; in our case it provides yet another
possibility to make an error leading to a paradox.

We accelerate the particles in the same way as in the
process of simultaneous deceleration discussed in the pre-
ceding paragraph, i.e., we perform simultaneous acceler-
ation from rest to velocity v during time τ . The radiated
energy during the acceleration, then, should be the same
as in the process of stopping, see Eq. (20). For simulta-
neous acceleration x = 0, so the interference term is

Initial energy of the particles is

Rint =

q2v2
c2l

.

Ein = 2mc2 +

q2
l

,

(42)

(43)

Since the ﬁnal state of the particles (motion with velocity
v and separation l) is identical to the initial state of the
particles in the previous example, the expression for the
ﬁnal energy Ef in is given by the RHS of (31).

Again, for each particle we can write the equation of
conservation of energy for the process when the other
particle is not present:

mc2 = γmc2 + W1 + R1,
mc2 = γmc2 + W2 + R2,

(44)

where W1, W2 are deﬁned as work performed by the par-
ticles and are negative in this case.

This restores the balance in the equation of conservation
of energy canceling the unbalanced terms in (46).

Since the charges start to move together, it seems that
the net work is done only during the acceleration period.
Therefore, the equation of conservation of energy is:

Ein = Ef in + W1 + W2 + R1 + R2 + Rint.

particle equations we obtain:

The ﬁnal energy is larger than the initial energy: contra-
diction!

The error we made here is more transparent. It ap-
pears in the sentence stating that the only net work of
the charges is done during the acceleration period. It is
true that in a stationary case (particles keep their motion
all the time) the net work of charges moving with con-
stant velocity vanishes. However, at the beginning of the
motion, the ﬁelds at the vicinity of the charges are dif-
ferent from the Coulomb ﬁeld of the stationary motion:
each particle feels the static ﬁeld of the other particle
(i.e., as if it has not moved) until the signal from the
motion of the other particle can arrive.

Let us calculate the contribution to the work due to
the forces between the particles. Particle 2 moves in the
static ﬁeld of particle 1 during the time t = l
c+v after
which it feels the stationary ﬁeld of particle 1 which is
q
γ2l2 . Similarly, particle 1 moves in the static ﬁeld of
particle 2 during the time t′ = l
c−v , after which it feels
the stationary ﬁeld of particle 2 of the same strength
but in the opposite direction. After time t′, there is no
contribution to the net work due to the forces between the
two particles. Until this time, particle 1 covers distance
x′ = vt′ in the static ﬁeld of particle 2. Therefore, the
contribution to the work from particle 1 is:

q2

q2
l + x′ =

The contributions (47) and (48) cancel each other, so

We have resolved the contradiction by taking into ac-
count the work performed by charged particles during
the transition period from static ﬁeld to stationary ﬁeld
l
c−v . But what happens if we skip the inter-
which lasts
mediate stage? We accelerate the particles to velocity v
and shortly after (before the particles ﬁnished perform-
ing the work (50)) stop them in a similar manner. What
is the source of the radiation energy (42) in this case? In
fact, since we have two processes with the acceleration, it
seems that we are missing even more, twice this amount!
No, this is another error. We need not look for the
source of the radiation energy, because the radiation ﬁeld
due to the acceleration and the radiation ﬁeld due to

stopping interfere destructively.
example of a destructive interference of radiation ﬁeld
from a moving body.18) We are not going to analyze the
destructive interference in a quantitative way in this case.
The same eﬀect yields the resolution of Paradox I which
is demonstrated in a quantitative way in Section VIII.
Before this, in the next section, we present a paradox
arising from yet another subtle eﬀect.

VII. ACCELERATING PARTICLES MOVING
IN PARALLEL

Let us consider acceleration of two charged particles
lined up in the y axis instead of the x axis. The particles
accelerate simultaneously from rest to velocity v in the x
direction. The expression for the initial energy is again
(43). The ﬁnal energy, however, is diﬀerent:

Ef in = γ

2mc2 +

(cid:18)

q2
l (cid:19)

.

(51)

Indeed, in the rest frame of the moving particles the dis-
tance between them is l. In this case the electromagnetic
energy is transformed in the usual way (26) because the
energy of the composite system of charges and the rod
is transformed according to (26) and the energy of the
rod with the tension in the y direction is transformed ac-
cording to (26). The anomalous behavior of the rod in
the previous case followed from the presence of σxx com-
ponent of the stress tensor which vanishes in the vertical
conﬁguration.

The interference term of the radiation energy is mod-
iﬁed too. In the x axis conﬁguration, the interference is
in the y − z plane and it always has the angle π
2 relative
to the direction of the acceleration. In the y axis conﬁg-
uration, the interference is in the x − z plane with vary-
ing angle θ relative to the direction of the acceleration.
Therefore, the interference is not always in the direction
of the maximal intensity. The intensity is proportional
to sin2 θ, see (15), and, therefore, averaging on θ reduces
the interference term relative to the x conﬁguration (42)

by the factor of 2:

(53)

(54)

Although during the stationary motion the charges do
not exert forces in the direction of motion, in the tran-
sition period, when the charges move in the static ﬁeld,
there is a small component of the force in the direction
of motion. The particles move in the static ﬁeld during
the time t which fulﬁlls

Therefore ct = γl. The total work each particle performs
is

ct =

l2 + t2v2.

The single-particle equations of conservation of energy,
of course, remain the same. Thus, putting together all
terms of the conservation of energy equation
Ein = Ef in +W1 +W2 + ˜W1 + ˜W2 +R1 +R2 +Rint, (55)

and subtracting single particle equations (44), we obtain:

Contradiction again: The ﬁnal energy is larger than the
initial energy. Calculating up to the second order in the
parameter v2
c2 we see three contributions in the units of
v2q2
c2l . The increase in the potential energy contributes 1
2 ,
the work of the static ﬁelds during the transition period
contributes 2 · 1
2 = 1, and the interference of radiation
contributes 1

2 . All terms together contribute 2v2q2
The eﬀect we missed here is, probably, the most subtle
one. We have not taken into account the work of the ra-
diation ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld at the point r (relative to
the charge), due to the radiation of the charge q moving
with acceleration a, is:11
q
c2r

ˆr × (ˆr × a).

E =

(57)

c2l

.

For our conﬁguration, the ﬁeld is:

This ﬁeld exerts force during the time τ during which
the particle moves distance τ v. Taking into account that
a = v
τ we obtain that the force of the radiation ﬁeld
changes the energy of each particle by

E = −

qa
c2l

ˆx.

Wrad = −

q2v2
c2l

.

Both particles lose their energy in this way and, there-
fore, we lose two units of v2q2
restoring the equation of
c2l
conservation of energy.

Note that in the x conﬁguration of charges, the work
of the radiation ﬁeld vanishes because in this case the
radiation ﬁelds at the locations of the particles vanish.

8

Now we have learned all the eﬀects necessary for the
resolution of Paradox I. In fact, we have seen a few eﬀects
which do not play a role in this case, but understanding
them increases our conﬁdence that our explanation is the
correct one.

The anomalous transformation of the electromagnetic
energy is not relevant because the charges are at rest at
the beginning and at the end of the process. The sub-
tle eﬀect of the work performed by the radiation ﬁeld is
not present too, since the radiation ﬁelds in the locations
of the particles vanish.
It is the interference of radia-
tion which we have not taken into account that resolves
the paradox. The radiation energy (12) is much larger
than the term (3) which we have to compensate, see (13).
However, we would like to get quantitative resolution of
this paradox showing how the missing term (3) arises
from the calculation of the radiation energy.

In order to obtain a quantitative result we specify how
we perform the process described in Section I. We assume
that we perform it exactly as in all other setups described
here: we accelerate particles during small time τ until
In case (i), the particle moves
they reach velocity v.
with constant velocity the distance x when it stops in
the same manner as it was accelerated. In case (ii), both
particles reach velocity v (absolute value) and stop at
time t after passing the distance x/2. The time t is short
enough such that each particle cannot receive a signal
during its motion about the motion of the other particle.
Thus,

τ ≪ t =

<

x
2v

l
c + v

.

In case (i) the radiation energy is created in the same
amount due to the acceleration and due to the stopping
of the particle and, therefore, it is twice the amount given
by the Larmor formula (12):

(60)

(61)

Ri =

4
3

q2v2
c3τ

.

(58)

(59)

In case (ii) there are four events of changing veloc-
ity of a particle by amount v and, therefore, there are
four spherical shells of radiation ﬁeld of the width τ c, see
Fig. 5. The radiation energy is four times the Larmor
energy (12) with the correction due to the interference.
The correction due to the interference has four terms.
The interferences are due to radiation emitted during the
acceleration of the two particles, stopping of the two par-
ticles, acceleration of the ﬁrst and stopping of the second,
and acceleration of the second and stopping of the ﬁrst.
All these terms can be calculated in the same way as
we have calculated the interference of radiation energy of
two stopping charged particles in Section IV.

Accelerations and decelerations of the particles are per-
formed simultaneously, therefore, the direction of inter-
ference is θ = π
2 . This is the direction of the maximal

9

power of the radiation energy, see (15). The range of the
angles for which there is the interference is given by (17)
and, thus, similarly to derivation of (20), we obtain that
the interference term due to simultaneous acceleration is
equal to the term due to simultaneous stopping, and it
equals

−

q2v2
c2l

,

(62)

where the minus sign is because particles accelerate in
opposite directions and the second term of (20) does not
appear since simultaneity corresponds to x = 0 in the
notation of Section III.

The interference between acceleration of the ﬁrst and
stopping of the second takes place in the direction ˆθ1
deﬁned by

sin(θ1 −

) =

π
2

ct
l − vt

.

(63)

For calculating this correction we can use (20) again, tak-
ing into account that the particle stops after passing the
distance vt = x

2 . Therefore, this contribution is:

In our case l ≫ vt, so we can make an approximation
l − vt ≈ l + vt ≈ l and, therefore, we get the same
expression again. Summing up all the expressions, we
obtain:

Now we are able to analyze the setup of Paradox I
taking into account the radiation energy. In case (i) the
work performed by the external forces should include the
radiation energy (61). Thus, instead of (1) we obtain

In case (ii), following the structure of Paradox I, we
have to calculate the work taking into account the causal-
ity argument: each particle “does not know” that the
other particle moved. Therefore, the work against the
ﬁeld and the radiated energy should be calculated as if
the other particle has not moved. The work is twice the
amount of work in case (i) with the change of x → x
2 .
Thus, instead of (2), we obtain

Clearly we cannot gain energy from constructing a ma-

This work is greater than zero, since the radiation term
is much larger than the gain in the potential energy; it
can be seen explicitly using (60). However, even if we
collect the radiation energy, we still cannot gain energy.

completes the analysis of the paradox presented at the
beginning of this paper.

Is it a simple task to demonstrate conservation of en-
ergy to a higher order in v
c ? It is not diﬃcult to ex-
pand the algebraic expressions we have to a higher order,

but this is not enough. We have used more approxima-
tions, in particular, the formulas for the radiation of the
charged particles we have used are correct only in the
approximation of small acceleration and small velocities.
Indeed, Eq. (12) cannot be universally correct, since it
says that by reducing τ , the time of stopping the charged
particle, we can obtain unlimited amount of radiation en-
ergy: clearly we cannot get more energy than the particle
has. Thus, higher order calculations of the equation of
conservation of energy is an elaborate task which goes
beyond the scope of this paper.

In this paper we have analyzed some relativistic fea-
tures of the classical electromagnetic theory. We demon-
strated in a quantitative way the relevance of the sev-
eral eﬀects to the balance of conservation of energy in
a system of charges. These eﬀects are: changing of the

electromagnetic ﬁeld according to relativistic causality
constraints, anomalous transformation of the electromag-
netic energy, energy radiated by accelerated charges, in-
terference of radiation, and work performed by the ra-
diation ﬁeld. We believe that presenting the subject in
the form of “paradoxes” helps to achieve a deeper un-
derstanding. Obtaining quantitative resolutions of pre-
sented paradoxical situations helps to reach conﬁdence
in applying the equation of conservation of energy for
indirect calculations of various eﬀects.

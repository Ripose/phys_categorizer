Comment on “Total Relativity: Mach 2004”

Abstract

Frank Wilczek’s essay “Total Relativity: Mach 2004” (PHYSICS TO-
DAY, April, 2004, page 10) cogently updates the status of the intuitively
compelling, but partly unrealized theory of, Mach’s principle.
I think,
however, that important consequences of the principle have been skipped.
[Note: This Comment is similar to one submitted to, but not published
by, PHYSICS TODAY as a Letter to the Editor.]

Einstein’s ﬁeld equations for gravitation (called General Relativity, although
what is generalized is not relativity but ﬂat Minkowski spacetime to nonﬂat
Riemann-Minkowski spacetime) do realize Mach’s principle in part: The metric
tensor ﬁeld gµν (X), where

labels a point in space-time, is equivalent geometrically to (i) a ﬁeld of space-time
volume measure | det(g(X))|1/2dX 0dX 1dX 2dX 3, and (ii) a ﬁeld of light cones
in the tangent planes, deﬁned by the quadratic form (summation convention
from 1 to 3 is on)

gµν (X) V µ(X) V ν (X) = 0,
where V (X) is a vector in the tangent plane at X. These ﬁelds are determined by
the distribution of matter everywhere in the universe, and by initial+boundary
conditions on the ﬁelds.

Consider a point transformation in the spacetime manifold, in the presence
of a ﬁxed, locally inertial coordinate system. Then the transformation takes the
local form

¯X λ = Dλ + EλµX µ + F λµν X µX ν + higher-order terms.
The four parameters in Dλ represent uniform displacements in spacetime, the
sixteen parameters in Eλµ include the six-parameter subgroup of homogeneous
Lorentz transformations, and the forty parameters in F λµν include the six-
parameter nongroup family of nonrelativistic, uniform linear accelerations and
the leading terms in a uniformly evolving rotation:

¯t = t,
¯r = r + (t2/2)a + t(ω × r)

+ terms linear in r and of second or higher order in t.

We imagine a single elementary particle to be a trajectory in the spacetime
manifold, where the particle has, at each point in its trajectory, an internal
structure consisting of a light cone, a space-time volume, and possibly other
intrinsic attributes as spin angular momentum, electric charge, etc. As the
particle evolves along its dynamical trajectory, its internal light cone and space-
time volume are, in common contemporary theories, presumed implicitly to be
constrained to track precisely with the ambient structures established by grav-
itation. The principle of relativity states, in eﬀect, that the rest of the universe
aﬀords no local resistance, or generalized restoring force, to the “deformations”
of the particle aﬀorded by the ten-parameter Poincar´e group, subject to the
further constraint that, for a particle with spin, the “internal” Lorentz boost
is locked in to the external one associated with its trajectory in spacetime; a
particle so deformed stays where it was put—Newton’s First Law. As originally
formulated, Mach’s principle asserts that the deformation of a trajectory corre-
sponding to a linear acceleration is opposed by a restoring force according to the
formula F = −ma; uniformly evolving rotations give rise to internal stresses and
strains, as in Newton’s bucket experiment (to be sure, the second eﬀect derives
at least in part from the ﬁrst).

Although is is easy to eﬀect the above-described special types of second-order
deformations in practice, it is plausible that a hypothetical physical theory that
realizes Mach’s principle in the form of “total relativity” should ﬁrst deal with
the ten-parameter family of linear deformations of the particle’s internal struc-
ture that is omitted when we conﬁne our attention to the Poincar´e group. These
comprise (i) the one-parameter subgroup of spacetime-isotropic dilations of a
particle, and (ii) the nine-parameter nongroup family of anisotropic strain de-
formations of a particle. Elements in (i), which belong to the class of conformal
transformations, do not deform a particle’s light cone, but deform its space-
time volume; elements in (ii) deform its local light cone, but do not aﬀect its
spacetime volume. Both these types of deformation of a particle are resisted
so strongly by the rest of the universe that they are apparently unphysical.
The restoring force exerted by the universe to these deformations may not be
inﬁnite, however; it is possible that, under presently undiscovered extreme con-
ditions, elementary particles respond with nonzero strain to suitable forces. In
other words, elementary particles might display additional (discrete or contin-
uous) internal degrees of freedom, that are excited when intense isotropic or
anisotropic stresses are imposed on them. A theory of total relativity should
then describe how it comes to be that the universe establishes imperfectly both a
local light cone and a local measure of spacetime volume, such that it is diﬃcult,
but not impossible, to make internal strain degrees of freedom of an elementary
particle to manifest themselves.

We report detailed studies on ferromagnet–superconductor bilayer structures. Epitaxial bilayer
structures of half metal–colossal magnetoresistive La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (HM–CMR) and high–Tc su-
perconducting YBa2Cu3O7−δ(HTSC) are grown on SrTiO3 (100) single–crystalline substrates using
pulsed laser deposition. Magnetization M (T) measurements show the coexistence of ferromagnetism
and superconductivity in these structures at low temperatures. Using the HM–CMR layer as an elec-
trode for spin polarized electrons, we discuss the role of spin polarized self injection into the HTSC
layer. The experimental results are in good agreement with a presented theoretical estimation,
where the spin diﬀusion length ξFM is found to be in the range of ξFM ≈ 10 nm.

I. INTRODUCTION

The antagonism between ferromagnetism and super-
conductivity has been described very early by Ginzburg1.
Based on the inverse of the Meissner eﬀect, surface cur-
rents shield the external region from being frozen in
a magnetic ﬁeld. Pioneering experiments on classical
FM/SC tunneling junctions were carried out by Tedrow
and Meservey2.
In their experiment a ferromagnetic
(FM) electrode is used to inject spin–polarized quasipar-
ticles (SPQP) into superconducting layers. The injec-
tion of quasiparticles into superconductors creates a local
nonequilibrium state which suppresses the superconduct-
3.
ing order parameter and the critical current density jc
Theoretical works on bilayers of metallic ferromagnets
and low-temperature superconductors4,5 predicted oscil-
lations of the critical temperature Tc. This was conﬁrmed
by experimental results6,7. The oscillating behavior of
the superconducting temperature is due to tunneling of
Cooper–pairs into the FM layer8. A review on this topic
is given by Izyumov et al.9.

In the past few years, much attention has been paid
to junctions consisting of La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (LCMO),
a material that shows a colossal magnetoresistance
(CMR) eﬀect, and of YBa2Cu3O7−δ (YBCO), a high-Tc
superconductor10–17.

Experiments with these junctions allow to obtain infor-
mation about the spin–dependent properties of high-Tc
superconductors that can lead to the design of new su-
perconducting devices such as “spintronic devices”, like
transistors with high gain current and high speed. “Spin-
tronics” means the exploitation of the spins of the elec-
trons rather than their charge. Spin controlled solid state
devices based on the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) ef-
fect are already realized in read-out heads of hard disks.
Further challenges in the ﬁeld of spintronics that are ad-
dressed by experiments and theory include the optimiza-
tion of electron–spin life times and the detection of the
spin coherence length in nanoscale structures.

The high spin polarization, in addition to ferromag-
netic ordering, is characteristic for hole–doped rare earth

manganites of the form R1−xAxMnO3 (R: trivalent rare–
earth ions, A: divalent alkaline–earth ions). In this case
the spin polarization of the transport electrons is close to
100 %18–20.

The fact that the in–plane lattice parameters of
La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 and YBa2Cu3O7−δ are very similar al-
lows an epitaxial growth of LCMO/YBCO bilayers with
structurally sharp interfaces. These bilayers represent
adequate model systems to investigate spin diﬀusion into
high-temperature superconducting ﬁlms which is shown
in this paper.

Recently, several experimental and theoretical eﬀorts
have been performed12,21,22 to determine the spin diﬀu-
sion length ξFM in CMR/HTSC multilayered structures,
but up to now no clear answer could be given. We show,
that in bilayer or superlattice structures of manganites
and cuprates the spin diﬀusion length can be determined
from the experimentally observed properties.

We present a rough theoretical estimation for the spin
diﬀusion length in heterostructures of cuprates and man-
ganites. This estimation is able to describe properly the
experimental results of bilayer structures and superlat-
tices of CMR/HTSC.

Our results are obtained by investigating epitaxial bi-
layer structures of thin ﬁlms of ferromagnetic LCMO and
high-Tc superconducting YBCO. A sketch of these sam-
ples is shown in Fig. (1). The temperature-dependent
magnetization of these samples after zero-ﬁeld cooling
to T = 5 K has been determined to show if a coexis-
tence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity at low
temperatures occurs.
In these experiments it is found
that the superconducting transition temperature of the
YBCO ﬁlm decreases strongly for thicknesses of the su-
perconductor of ds = 30 nm and below. This is in con-
trast to YBCO single layers, where a thickness depen-
dence of Tc occurs only for ﬁlms with thicknesses of well
below 10 nm23,24. The drop of the transition tempera-
ture for LCMO/YBCO bilayers can now be described by
applying a rough theoretical estimation taking into ac-
count the diﬀusion of spin–polarized quasiparticles with
a penetration depth of the order of 10 nm.

La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (LCMO) and YBa2Cu3O7−δ (YBCO) are
grown by pulsed laser deposition onto SrTiO3 (100) single
crystalline substrates.

II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Epitaxial bilayers of La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 and optimally
doped YBa2Cu3O7−δ are grown by pulsed laser depo-
sition. The target used for the ferromagnetic layer,
that is ﬁrst deposited, has a nominal composition of
La2/3Ca1/3MnO3, the superconducting layer on top is
grown by using a target YBa2Cu3O6.95. As substrates
5×5 mm2 SrTiO3 (STO) (100) single crystals are used.
The substrate is kept at a constant temperature of
780 ◦C, the temperature is adjusted by a far-infrared py-
rometric temperature control. During the deposition an
oxygen pressure of 0.4 mbar in case of the LCMO layer
and 0.6 mbar during the YBCO deposition is used. Af-
terwards the bilayer is annealed in-situ for 30–60 minutes
at 530 ◦C in an oxygen pressure of 1.0 bar. This proce-
dure results in ﬁlms of high crystalline quality, full oxy-
genation, and sharp ﬁlm–substrate interfaces10. Struc-
tural studies are carried out by x-ray diﬀraction (XRD)
at room temperature, the resistance R(T ) is measured
with evaporated chromium gold contacts using the stan-
dard four-probe technique. The temperature dependence
of the magnetization M (T) is recorded in a magnetic ﬁeld
parallel to the ﬁlm plane using a Quantum Design MPMS
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)
magnetometer.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A. X-ray diﬀraction pattern (XRD)

The STO substrate has a perfect cubic perovskite
structure and both the magnetic La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 layer
and the superconducting YBa2Cu3O7−δ layer have an or-
thorhombic lattice structure. The important structural
information of all of the used materials is given in table
(I). The epitaxial YBCO thin ﬁlm on top of the LCMO
layer grows under tensile strain of ε ≈ 0.4 %, where ε
can be written as: ε = [(aLCMO × bLCMO)1/2 − (aYBCO ×
bYBCO)1/2]/(aYBCO × bYBCO)1/2.

The x-ray diﬀraction pattern, Fig. (2a-d), shows (00ℓ)
diﬀraction peaks for both the LCMO and the YBCO lay-
ers for bilayer dimensions of dLCMO= 50 nm / dYBCO=
20 nm Fig. (2a), dLCMO = 50 nm / dYBCO = 30 nm Fig.
(2b), dLCMO = 50 nm / dYBCO= 50 nm Fig. (2c), and
dLCMO = 50 nm / dYBCO= 100 nm Fig. (2d); i.e. they
are at least c-axis textured. Furthermore, the sequence
of the layers has been changed. YBCO was ﬁrst grown
as bottom layer (here the YBCO structure is controlled
by STO substrate) and the LCMO is grown on top. For
these samples the same results are found.

In transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images
collected at similar samples just consisting of more than
two layers10 (prepared under the same conditions in the
identical set-up) it can be found that these samples show
atomic ﬂat interfaces. That means, that LCMO and
YBCO grow cube on cube by forming structurally a high–
quality interface. Consequently we assume that possible
perturbations created due to structural variations at the
interface can be neglected.

tures with thicknesses of dLCMO = 50 nm and dYBCO= 20 nm

the (00ℓ) peak is found, i.e. the both layers show c–axis tex-
tured growth on the STO (100) substrate.

(Color online) Temperature dependence of
the magnetization M (T) after zero–ﬁeld cooling (a) and
ﬁeld–cooling (b) in an in–plane magnetic ﬁeld Hext = 10 Oe.
Shown are the results for bilayers of dLCMO = 50 nm and
dYBCO= 20 nm, 30 nm, and 100 nm. The 50 nm /
30 nm bilayer shows two ferromagnetic transitions in the
zero–ﬁeld–cooled measurement (a). The ﬁrst at TCurie =
229 K can not be seen in the ﬁgure the second one occurs
at TCurie =180 K. We attribute this behavior to a nonhomo-
geneous magnetic layer in that sample.

B. Magnetization measurements

Fig. (3a) shows the magnetization M (T) as a func-
tion of temperature for three diﬀerent bilayers. The
measurements are performed after zero–ﬁeld cooling to
T = 5 K. Then, the magnetization is measured with in-
creasing temperature in an in-plane external magnetic
ﬁeld of Hext = 10 Oe. The three curves refer to three
diﬀerent bilayers with dimensions of dLCMO = 50 nm
and dYBCO = 20, 30, and 100 nm, respectively. In Fig.
(3a) starting at low temperatures, we see a negative mag-
netization that refers to the diamagnetic signal of the
dominant superconducting state. With increasing the
temperature the magnetization jumps to positive values.
This temperature identiﬁes the superconducting transi-
tion temperature Tc. Above the critical temperature Tc,
which depends on the thickness of the YBCO layer, we
ﬁnd a positive magnetization that is caused by the ferro-
magnetic ordering in the LCMO layer. With increasing
temperature the magnetization drops to zero. This tem-
perature identiﬁes the ferromagnetic transition tempera-
ture TCurie. To prove that the ferromagnetic ordering is
also present below the superconducting transition, where
the signal is governed by the diamagnetic response of
the YBCO layer, also the ﬁeld-cooled magnetization is
measured. The results are given in Fig. (3b). It shows
the magnetization M (T) as function of the temperatures
for the three diﬀerent bilayers. The ﬁeld-cooled measure-
ment M (T) is done in an in-plane external magnetic ﬁeld
of Hext = 10 Oe. Here, two important features are found,
ﬁrst, ferromagnetism occurs in the whole temperature
range; T ≤ TCurie. Second, the ferromagnetic ordering
shifts to lower temperatures with increasing thickness of
the YBCO layer.

FIG. 4. (Color online) Temperature dependent in-plane re-
sistance R(T) for the same samples as in Fig (3a). The data
are collected from standard four-probe measurements.

In addition to the magnetization data we performed
electric transport measurements R(T) for the bilayers,
as shown in Fig. (4). Three results are given for dLCMO
= 50 nm and dYBCO= 20 nm, 30 nm, and 100 nm. In
case of the thinnest bilayer we ﬁnd a transition from a
semiconductor–like behavior (dR/dT < 0) to a metallic–
like (dR/dT > 0) around T = 180 K. This shows that the
properties of the YBCO in the bilayer have to be strongly
aﬀected due to the presence of the LCMO layer. Oth-
erwise the large diﬀerence in resistivity between YBCO
[ρYBCO (T=300 K) ≈ 400 µΩcm] and LCMO [ρLCMO
(T=300 K) ≈ 100 mΩcm] would lead to current ﬂow
only in the cuprate layer. But this behavior can only be
found in case of bilayers with thicknesses of the YBCO
layer of dYBCO= 30 nm and 100 nm, respectively. The
diﬀerent R(T) behavior of the 50 nm/20 nm bilayer is
therefore related to a diﬀusion of spin–polarized quasi-
particles from the LCMO layer into YBCO.

temperature of bilayers on STO with varying thickness of
the YBCO layer obtained from the diamagnetic on–set in the
zero–ﬁeld–cooling magnetization measurements.

From the zero–ﬁeld cooled magnetization curves M (T)
we extract the transition temperature Tc of the YBCO
ﬁlm. Here the diamagnetic signal is used to deﬁne Tc,
the values are determined by the maximum of the ﬁrst
derivative of M (T). As a result we ﬁnd a strong decrease

3

of Tc for bilayers containing thin YBCO layers. In case of
20 nm YBCO ﬁlm we ﬁnd Tc= 23 K, for the 30 nm ﬁlm
we ﬁnd Tc= 76 K, whereas bilayers with thicker YBCO
ﬁlms show transition temperatures between Tc= 85 K
and 90 K. A plot of the transition temperatures for dif-
ferent YBCO thicknesses shown in Fig.(5).

Additionally, we want to remark, that not only the
transition temperature but also the critical current den-
sity in the YBCO layer is aﬀected by the magnetic layer.
Magnetic ﬂux pinning inside the superconductor leads
to a hysteretic behavior of the critical current density

C. Rough theoretical estimation of ξFM

In this section we present a rough theoretical estima-
tion that is able to describe the observed reduction of
the superconducting transition temperature in the inves-
tigated bilayer systems. The application of the model
allows us ﬁnally to give an estimate for the spin diﬀu-
sion length of the spin polarized quasiparticles from the
ferromagnet into the superconductor.

The decay length of the superconducting order param-
eter ξprox in the ferromagnetic layer (proximity eﬀect )
can be written as

where vF is the Fermi velocity and ∆Eex the exchange
splitting energy of the ferromagnetic layer.

So far, oscillations of the superconducting transition
temperature Tc in the CMR / d -wave–HTSC superlat-
tices have not been found experimentally10,13. This can
be understood from the following equation:

ξprox =

FIG. 6. (Color online) Ferromagnetic ordering temperature
TCurie and saturation magnetization Ms of bilayers with vary-
ing thickness of the YBCO layer. TCurie is determined from
the on–set of the ferromagnetic signal in Fig.(3b). Ms is deter-
mined from the saturation signal M (T ) in Fig. (3b) divided
by the volume of the LCMO layer. TCurie and Ms strongly
decrease with increasing YBCO thickness.

Another interesting observation in the ﬁeld–cooled
magnetization M (T) in Fig.
(3b) is the increase of
the ferromagnetic transition temperature with decreas-
ing thickness of the YBCO layer. We measure, for a
ﬁxed CMR layer thickness of 50 nm, ferromagnetic tran-
sition temperatures TCurie = 245 K, 240 K, and 117 K
for the YBCO thicknesses of 20, 30, and 100 nm, respec-
tively. In Fig. (6) a plot of the ferromagnetic ordering
temperature TCurie of all bilayer structures as a function
of the thickness of the YBCO layer is shown. The 1/3-
Ca doped La1−xCaxMnO3 compound has a bulk value
of TCurie−bulk ≈ 275 K, for thin ﬁlms TCurie = 245 K
is measured25. The reduction of the ferromagnetic or-
dering temperature may be regarded as indication for
a charge transfer from the ferromagnetic layer into the
superconductor. However, evidence for this process can
not be given from these experiments. We want to address
this question by the performance of optical conductivity
measurements. These results will be published elsewhere.
Concerning the coexistence of the two phenomena (fer-
romagnetism and superconductivity), we speculate that,
the very low in–plane coherence length ξab ≈ 1.6 nm of
the high-Tc materials rules out that such a coexistence
can be found in more than 1 to 2 unit cells away from
the interface.

where ξsc is the coherence length; Dsc the electron diﬀu-
sion coeﬃcient in the superconductor; kB is Boltzmann’s
constant and Tc the critical temperature.

From equations (1) and (2) we conclude that oscilla-
tions of the critical temperature Tc of the unconventional
superlattices (CMR/d -wave SC) do not occur due to the
large exchange energy ∆Eex ≈ 3 eV26 for the hole-doped
rare–earth manganites in conjunction with the short co-
herence length ξab ≈ 1.6 nm, ξc ≈ 0.3 nm for YBCO.
Additionally, a very small spin diﬀusion length ξFM into
the superconducting layer is expected. The nearly full
spin polarization (spin↑ or spin↓) at the Fermi level of
LCMO leads to quenching not only of the Andreev reﬂec-
tions 27 but also of the proximity eﬀect, since it prevents
the Cooper–pairs to tunnel into the magnetic layer. This
also leads to the absence of oscillations of Tc in these
CMR/HTSC superlattices.

The pair breaking in CMR/HTSC due to the injection
of quasiparticles (QPI) into the superconducting layer
has been taken into account3,12,13. This phenomenon
has been very early investigated by Parker28 and can be
written as:

∆(nqp)
∆(0)

≈ 1 −

2nqp
4N (0)∆(0)

(3)

where ∆(nqp) is the energy required to suppress the or-
der parameter of the superconductor due to the density
of spin polarized quasiparticles nqp. N(0) and ∆(0) give
the density of states and the order parameter at T = 0 K,
respectively. nqp is generated by self-injection along the
c-axis across the highly transparent interface and is gov-
erned by the high exchange splitting energy ∆Eex ≈ 3 eV

of the magnetic layer, see equation (1). The QPI is a tem-
perature dependent function and can be derived in the
following form22,29:

with ∆(0) ≈ 20 meV for YBCO12. From equation (3),
we end up with a relation where the temperature depen-
dence and the length scale of the spin diﬀusion length
ξFM is included.

First, we have to consider the spin density in the super-
conductor. It is assumed that spins in high–temperature
superconductors can be described as unitary scatterers.
From Zn doping in YBCO it is known that a critical
30–32.
doping in the range of 2-10 % strongly reduces Tc
This critical density of spins is achieved at a distance of
d = α ξFM, with α ≈ 3. This d is now identiﬁed with
the YBCO ﬁlm thickness. This enables us to model the
experimental data by:

Introducing now nqp(T) from equation (4) we are able
to ﬁt our experimental data using the quasiparticle den-
sity as the only free parameter. This parameter nqp(T)
describes the decrease of the energy gap ∆(nqp)28,33.
In our case we ﬁnd the best ﬁtting for nqp(T)≈ 0.36,
0.35, and 0.13 for T/Tc = 0.01, 0.3, and 0.9, respec-
tively, which agrees with other theoretical calculations of
nqp(T)≈ 0.32, 0.31, and 0.09 at the same temperature ra-
tio for d -wave superconductors29,34. Figure (7) shows the
experimentally determined transition temperatures nor-
malized to the Tc−bulk=91 K for diﬀerent ﬁlm thicknesses
on two diﬀerent substrates SrTiO3 (STO) and LaSrGaO4
(LSGO) and the ﬁt to the rough theoretical estimation.

FIG. 7. (Color online) The normalized superconducting
transition temperature of bilayers with varying thickness of
the YBCO layer on STO and LSGO substrates obtained from
the diamagnetic on–set in the zero–ﬁeld–cooling magnetiza-
tion measurement (squares) and model according to equation
(8) (solid line). The model gives a good description of the
experimental data.

The description ﬁts nicely to the experimental re-
sults and suggests that the recovery of the transition
temperature Tc of the YBCO top layer takes place at
about 30 nm which leads to a spin diﬀusion length of
ξF M = d/α ≈10 nm. This ﬁnding is in good agre-
ment with results that have been estimated by Holden
et al.14 from optically investigated LCMO/YBCO super-
lattices by spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements of
the far–infrared (FIR) dielectric properties. These re-
sults provide an evidence that the free carrier response is
strongly suppressed in these superlattices as compared to
pure YBCO and LCMO ﬁlms, and they estimate that a
critical thickness for the YBCO is in the range of 20 nm.
Note, that in case of superlattices the spin diﬀusion quasi-
particles penetrate from both sides into to the supercon-
ducting ﬁlm. The accordance between the results shown
in this paper and other groups using diﬀerent experimen-
tal techniques gives rise to a spin diﬀusion length ξFM
from LCMO into YBCO in the order of 10 nm at low
temperatures.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have investigated experimentally and estimated
theoretically the eﬀects of the diﬀusion of spin polarized
quasiparticles in bilayer structures of manganites and
cuprates. From x-ray measurements we have shown that
YBa2Cu3O7−δ thin ﬁlms can be grown epitaxially on thin
epitaxial ﬁlms of La2/3Ca1/3MnO3. Transport and mag-
netization measurements show the coexistence of ferro-
magnetism and superconductivity at low temperatures
in these structures. We ﬁnd that the transition temper-
ature of the superconducting ﬁlm drastically decreases
with thinner YBa2Cu3O7−δ ﬁlms. The development of a
simple model allows us to explain the experimental data
and enables us to determine the spin diﬀusion length of
spin polarized quasiparticles from La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 into

5

YBa2Cu3O7−δ to be in the range of ξFM ≈ 10 nm.

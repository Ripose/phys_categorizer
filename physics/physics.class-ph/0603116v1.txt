Abstract

In the present paper we discuss antenna miniaturization using magneto-dielectric substrates.
Recent results found in the literature reveal that advantages over conventional dielectric sub-
strates can only be achieved if natural magnetic inclusions are embedded into the substrate.
This observation is revised and the physical background is clariﬁed. We present a detailed
discussion concerning magnetic materials available in the microwave regime and containing
natural magnetic constituents. The eﬀects of magnetic dispersion and loss are studied: con-
straints on the microwave permeability are used to estimate the eﬀect of magnetic substrates
on the achievable impedance bandwidth. Microwave composites ﬁlled with thin ferromagnetic
ﬁlms are considered as a prospective antenna substrate. We calculate the impedance bandwidth
for a λ/2-patch antenna loaded with the proposed substrate, and challenge the results against
those obtained with conventional dielectric substrates. It is shown that the radiation quality
factor is strongly minimized with the proposed substrate even in the presence of realistic losses.
Estimates for the radiation eﬃciency are given as a function of the magnetic loss factor.

1 Introduction

It is well known that the impedance bandwidth of electrically small antennas is roughly pro-
portional to the volume of the antenna in wavelengths. This means that when the antenna is
downsized the impedance bandwidth suﬀers. However, the trend in the communications indus-
try is towards smaller size devices, thus, eﬃcient antenna miniaturization is a clear necessity.
One of the most common miniaturization techniques is the loading of the antenna volume with
diﬀerent materials [1]–[4]. Most traditionally, high permittivity dielectrics have been used to
decrease the physical dimensions of the radiator, e.g. [5, 6, 7]. Common problems encountered
with high permittivity substrates include e.g. the excitation of surface waves leading to low-
ered radiation eﬃciency and pattern degradation, and diﬃculties in the impedance matching of
the antenna. Recently, artiﬁcial high-permeability materials working in the microwave regime
[8]–[16] have been proposed to decrease the size and/or to enhance the impedance bandwidth
properties of microstrip antennas [17]–[28].

According to the work of Hansen and Burke [17], inductive (magnetic) loading leads to an
eﬃcient size miniaturization of a microstrip antenna. When the material parameters of the an-
tenna substrate are dispersion-free, and µeﬀ
1, a transmission-line (TL) model for
a normal λ/2-patch antenna predicts that the impedance bandwidth is retained after miniatur-
ization [17]. Ikonen et al. [28] conducted extensive study on the eﬀect of frequency dispersion of
artiﬁcial 1 magneto-dielectric substrates on the impedance bandwidth properties of the loaded
antenna. It was analytically and experimentally shown that due to frequency dispersion of the
substrate the obtained radiation quality factor Qr always exceeds Qr obtained using conven-
tional dielectric substrates. This conclusion is valid when the voltage and current distribution
on the antenna element are not changed, and the static permeability equals unity. According to
the Rozanov limit [29] for the thickness to bandwidth ratio of radar absorbers, the thickness of
the absorber at microwave frequencies (with a given reﬂectivity level) is bounded by the static
value of µ of the absorber. Discussion presented in [28] revealed that the static properties of
the magneto-dielectric substrate play an important role also in antenna design. It was shown
that a substrate obeying the modiﬁed Lorentzian type dispersion rule and static permeability
exceeding unity was advantageous in terms of minimized Qr over some frequency range.

The present work has two main goals: 1) give a simple physical explanation on the advantages of
magnetic materials in antenna miniaturization by considering the actual measurable quantities
on the antenna element, namely the resonant current and voltage amplitudes. Moreover, using
a lumped element model we explicitly reveal the eﬀect of the static permeability and frequency
dispersion. The presently obtained results are generalized by revising the main results ob-
tained in [28]. 2) Present discussion concerning magnetic materials available in the microwave
regime and containing natural magnetic inclusions. Microwave composites ﬁlled with thin fer-
romagnetic ﬁlms [30] are introduced as prospective antenna substrates. The eﬀects of magnetic
dispersion and loss are studied. Using a TL-model we calculate the impedance bandwidth
properties of a patch antenna loaded with the proposed substrate and a conventional dielectric
substrate. It is shown that in terms of minimized radiation quality factor the proposed sub-
strate outperforms conventional dielectric substrates. Estimates for the radiation eﬃciency are
given as a function of the magnetic loss factor.

The rest of the paper is organized in the following way: in section II we revise the eﬀect of the

and discusses constraints on the achievable microwave permeability. The calculated impedance
bandwidth characteristics are presented in Section IV. The work is concluded in Section V.

2 The eﬀect of antenna substrate on Qr

2.1 Physical insight using dispersion-free material parameters

It is known that a magnetic substrate is advantageous in microstrip antenna miniaturization
if the material parameters of the substrate are lossless and dispersion-free, e.g. [17]. To give a
physical explanation on this phenomenon let us consider a resonant λ/2-patch antenna oper-
ating at a fundamental angular frequency ωx. Moreover, assume the antenna to be ﬁlled with
hypothetical dispersion-free and lossless materials characterized by µ, ǫ, Fig. 1. The impedance
behavior of the antenna can be approximated with the behavior of a parallel-resonant circuit
in the vicinity of ωx. Using the lumped element representation we get for the quality factor of
the antenna

Q =

(1)

where G represents the losses in the resonator (in this case mainly due to radiation), and L0
and C0 are the inductance and the capacitance of the empty resonator. From (1) we draw the
known observation: with a ﬁxed ωx an increase in the inductance (permeability of the ﬁlling
material) lowers the quality factor, whereas increase in the capacitance (permittivity) increases
the quality factor leading to a narrow impedance bandwidth.

A heuristic idea of the physics behind this observation can be received by considering the
oscillating in the circuit. At the resonance this amplitude is
amplitude of the current
typically very strong. When thinking of the antenna structure presented in Fig. 1a. the strong
current ﬂowing in the antenna element (and in the ground plane) creates a ﬂux which only
contributes to stored energy, since radiation happens at the edges of the patch. Moreover, if
one leaves the ends of the patch free from the ﬁlling (as is done in Fig. 1a.) the ﬁlling has only
a very small eﬀect on the radiation conductance. So intuitively one should try to decrease the
amplitude of the oscillating current as much as possible. Increase in C will lower the impedance
of the capacitor, moreover at the same time we must decrease L (to keep ωx ﬁxed) and this

in the circuit. The same observation will be seen by considering the stored energy in the circuit

2.2 The eﬀect of static permeability and frequency dispersion

Due to frequency dispersion of artiﬁcial magneto-dielectric substrates conventional dielectric
substrates are always better in terms of retained impedance bandwidth in antenna miniaturiza-
tion [28]. The eﬀect of frequency dispersion has a very fundamental nature, yet this eﬀect is
often neglected. A common misbelief is that by selecting the operational frequency of the an-
tenna closer to the substrate resonance the bandwidth is more eﬀectively retained since Re
}
{
is larger. However, the closer one lies to the substrate resonance, the steeper is the gradient of
the dispersion curve.

µeﬀ

To explain the eﬀect of static permeability and frequency dispersion let us assume that the
antenna shown in Fig. 1a. is ﬁlled with a magneto-dielectric material obeying the modiﬁed
Lorentzian type dispersion in µ = µ′

(3)

Above µs is the static permeability, Λ is the amplitude factor (0 < Λ < 1), ω0 is the undamped
angular frequency of the zeroth pole pair (the resonant frequency of the medium), and Γ is
the loss factor. The modiﬁed Lorentzian type dispersion rule is a commonly accepted model
for dense arrays of split-ring resonators and other similar structures (in this case µs = 1),
e.g. [9, 13, 16]. Certain composites containing natural magnetic constituents, e.g. composite
substrates containing thin ferromagnetic ﬁlms [30], can be modeled using the general Lorentzian
model. Here we study for the sake of clarity the eﬀect of static permeability using (3) since
the general Lorentzian model reduces to (3) at low frequencies. In (3) natural magnetism is
described by µs, however, (3) is not in a general case applicable with natural magnetics (as
will be explained in the next section). In the vicinity of the magnetic resonance the eﬀective
permittivity of a dense array of split ring resonators is weakly dispersive, and can be assumed
to be constant. With composites containing ferromagnetic ﬁlms the eﬀective permittivity can
also be considered dispersion-free over a wide frequency range. Thus, we assume C = C0ǫ,
where ǫ is the eﬀective permittivity of the substrate.

Usually a magnetic (magneto-dielectric) substrate is utilized well below the substrate resonance
ω0. For the sake of simplicity we assume that losses
(e.g. [19, 27, 28]) and we assume that ωx
in the magnetic material are negligible in the vicinity of ωx (Γ = 0)2, in addition to this the loss

there is no dispersion. When the antenna operates well enough below the material resonance
the dispersion is weak and the angular resonant frequency can be expanded into Taylor series:

Important observations can be made from (10): ﬁrst of all, if there is no dispersion (α = 0)
the quality factor reduces to the well known static result given by (1). From causality we know
that every passive and linear material is inevitably dispersive (and lossy), thus in reality α
= 0.
Eq. (10) shows the strong eﬀect of the static permeability which was noticed already in [28]:
if µs = 1 the magnetic material only increases the quality factor, no matter if the value of

2.3 Relative radiation quality factor

The above derivation based on the lumped element model can be generalized to some extend
by considering a resonator whose spectrum is concentrated near a certain frequency ωx (the

discussion partly follows the discussion presented in [28]). Again we assume that the resonator
is ﬁlled with low-loss materials ǫ(ω), µ(ω). Note that here we consider a general case of fre-
quency dispersion, the low-loss assumption is the only assumption that we make concerning
the dispersion law in the material. The known expression for the time-averaged energy density
of electromagnetic ﬁelds reads [31, 32]

in the resonator can be found by integrating wem over the volume of the resonator. From (11)

increase of stored energy due to frequency dispersion is also explicit in (11).

Let us consider a resonant λ/2-patch antenna having length l, width w, and height h. The

considered e.g. in [17]. In practise a patch antenna is commonly fed using a short and narrow
feed line to ease the impedance matching. For the discussion on additional stored energy due
to the feed strip, please see [28].

When studying antenna miniaturization using novel antenna substrates, conventional dielectric
substrates are often used as a reference substrate. Usually with high accuracy the permittivity
of the substrate can be regarded dispersion-free over a wide frequency range. Let us in the
reference case ﬁll the volume under the antenna element with a dielectric substrate oﬀering the

Formula for the energy density [eq. (11)] holds strictly only when the absorption due to losses
can be neglected. If losses in the material can not be neglected near the frequency of interest,
it is not possible to express energy density in terms of material permittivity and permeability
functions [31], pp. 28–30. One has to have knowledge about the material microstructure, and
this leads to a modiﬁcation of the energy density expression [34, 35]. With artiﬁcial magnetics

natural magnetic constituents the dispersion is anomalous also well below the material cutoﬀ
frequency. In this case the second term in the right part of (10) is negative, and dispersion
decreases the quality factor. However, losses and dispersion appear together according to the

loss eﬀect, and therefore the eﬀect of anomalous dispersion is not considered in the analysis of
next section.

3 Prospective magnetic materials for microwave frequen-

cies: revision of the key properties

Microwave performance of most magnetic materials containing natural magnetic constituents
is due to the ferromagnetic resonance. When modeling these materials the general Lorentzian

the permeability cutoﬀ frequency. The microwave permeability is large when both µs and ωres

are high. However, it is well known that these values are related tightly to each other: higher µs
leads to lower ωres, and vice versa. For most bulk magnetic materials the relation is established
by Snoek’s law:

where 4πMs is the saturation magnetization and γ
In magnetic materials,
both µs and ωres are dependent on the eﬀective anisotropy ﬁeld of the material, which, in
turn, depends on the composition, as well as on the manufacturing process, treatment, small
admixtures, etc. The right part of (18) is a function of the saturation magnetization, the value
of which is determined by the composition only. For this reason, Snoek’s law is conventionally
used for estimating the microwave performance of the material. Within the limits imposed by
Snoek’s law, the static permeability and resonant frequency can frequently be changed within
a wide range by certain technological means.

Eq. (19) is valid for thin ferromagnetic ﬁlms with in-plane magnetic anisotropy [37], and in
4π2 and µs is the largest component of permeability. The other case is related to
this case c
hexagonal ferrites [38] with c = 4π2/3[1 + (Hθ + Hφ)/(4πMs)], Hθ and Hφ are out-of-plane and
in-plane anisotropy ﬁelds respectively, and the material is assumed to be isotropic. Only these
two classes of magnets are known to obey (19). Eq. (19) permits higher static permeability
compared to (18) with the same resonant frequency, provided that ωres is not too high. The
value in the right part of eq. (19) is conventionally referred to as Acher’s constant of the
material, A. However, this constant is typically derived from the linear frequency rather than
from the angular frequency. Therefore the right part of (19) is equal to 4π2A, where A is
expressed in GHz2.

In hexagonal ferrites, typical values of Acher’s constant are not higher than 100 to 200 GHz2
[38, 39]. This means that with the resonant frequency ωres = 2π
3 GHz the static permeability
can be as high as 10 to 20. For a discussion of hexagonal ferrites for miniaturization of microstrip
antennas, see [27]. Ferromagnetic ﬁlms with in-plane anisotropy may have much larger Acher’s
constants due to higher saturation magnetization. For example, for iron 4πMs = 21.5 kG and
A = 3600 GHz2. However, with iron ﬁlms having thickness larger than approximately half
In
a micrometer the microwave performance is deteriorated by the eﬀect of eddy currents.
addition to this, the out-of-plane component of magnetization appears in thick ﬁlms and also
makes the microwave magnetic performance of the ﬁlm worse.

·

To apply ferromagnetic ﬁlms as a bulk material, which is needed e.g. if the ﬁlms are utilized
as microstrip antenna substrates, ﬁlm laminates may be used [30]. The laminates can be made
using sputtering process with a thin polymer substrate followed by stacking the sputtered
substrates together to obtain a bulk laminate. It is shown that for bulk laminates c = 4π2p
(p is the volume fraction of magnetic components in the laminate) in (19) [40]. For sputtered
microwave laminates made of iron, the ﬁlm thickness must not be larger than 0.3 mcm, and the
thickness of substrate may be as low as 10 mcm [40]. Then p = 3 % vol. and A = 120 GHz2,
If several magnetic layers

separated by non-magnetic interlayers are sputtered onto a polymer substrate, the volume
fraction p may be increased by a factor of order of the number of layers [40]. With this

8

method the potentially obtained microwave permeability values are the highest possible among
all magnets.

In some respect ﬁlm laminates have advantages over ferrites. Ferrites are ceramic materials,
hence they are not easily machined (which can be necessary for accurate adjusting of the reso-
nant size). Laminates consist mainly of polymeric substrate, thus, they are easily machineable
and may be shaped with high precision. Ferrites have a speciﬁc weight of approximately 5
g/cm3, while polymer-based ﬁlm laminates weight about 1 g/cm3. For low-frequency antennas
whose volume may be dozens of cubic centimeters, this diﬀerence may be essential. Moreover,
hexagonal ferrites have inherently high permittivity (ǫ = 15 and larger [39]), a feature which
is not typically desirable in antenna miniaturization in the view of retained impedance band-
width. For ﬁlm laminates the permittivity is anisotropic: the component perpendicular to ﬁlm
layers, which is the dominant component e.g. if the laminates are used in microstrip antenna
miniaturization, is as low as approximately ǫ = 2...2.5. Ferrites can be used as composites
with ferrite powder to diminish the above drawbacks, but in this case A
p and µs decreases
correspondingly [39]. On the other hand, the ﬁlm laminates require more complex technology
and can therefore be more expensive. Another thing which has to be remembered when using
thin ferromagnetic ﬁlms in antenna miniaturization is the conductivity along the ﬁlm layers.
The eﬀect occurs due to fringing electric ﬁelds and is seen as an increased eﬀective dielectric
loss tangent. However, with patch antennas the eﬀect can be reduced by leaving a short section
of empty space (length of the empty space about the height of the patch) near the radiating
edges, and/or using patterned ﬁlms.

∝

The most important issue deteriorating the microwave performance of the discussed materials is
the eﬀect of the quality factor of ferromagnetic resonance. Most practically realizable materials
have a low quality factor for the ferromagnetic resonance, so that β > 1 in eq. (18) and µ′ starts
to decrease at frequencies already well below the resonance. When β
1, the absorption peak
and, correspondingly, the region of stronger frequency dispersion are located in the vicinity
of ωres/β rather than in the vicinity of ωres. In this case, the permeability cutoﬀ frequency is
governed by Snoek’s law (18) rather than by Acher’s law (19) [41].

≫

When the proposed materials are used in antenna miniaturization the most important eﬀect of
magnetic loss is the rapid decrease of the radiation eﬃciency with increased frequency. From the
low-frequency asymptote of the Lorentzian dispersion law we arrive to the following bounding
relation between the operating frequency of the loaded antenna ωx, the ferromagnetic resonance
ωres, the damping factor β, the radiation quality factor Qr, and the radiation eﬃciency ηr:

Above, the magnetic loss tangent is estimated based on the Lorentzian dispersion law, in
actual magnets additional loss mechanisms appear for low frequency loss which may increase
noticeably the loss tangent at very low frequencies compared to the resonance [44]. From the
literature, fundamental restrictions concerning the quality factor of the ferromagnetic resonance
are not available. In actual samples, the quality factor is dependent on the inhomogeneity of
the sample, magnetic structure, etc. Most of the reported data on demagnetized polycrystalline
samples reveal wide-spread resonance curves. However, values of β that are as low as 0.2 can
be found for both ferromagnetic ﬁlms [42, 43] and hexagonal ferrites [27] (for all three data the
resonant frequency is 1.6 GHz). Generally, if ωx, Qr, β, and the Acher’s constant A are given,

what kind of static permeability values are possible given that A, β, ωx, and Qr are known. The
general expression is somewhat cumbersome, but in Fig. 2 we present values for the static per-
meability as functions of the operating frequency of the antenna ωx. A, β, and Qr vary according
to Table 1, ηr = 50% in every case. It is seen from Fig. 2 that the obtainable static permeability
values decrease dramatically as the operating frequency of the antenna increases. If the antenna
operates in the GHz range the obtainable permeability values are rather moderate.

4 Calculated impedance bandwidth properties with the

proposed substrate

In the present section we model a strip fed λ/2-patch antenna lying on top of a non-resonant
ground plane using a TL-representation. A schematic illustration of the antenna and the
equivalent TL-representation are shown in Fig. 3. The formulation of the model is introduced
in detail in [28]. The above described layered substrate containing thin ferromagnetic ﬁlms is
chosen as the studied antenna substrate. The dispersion of µeﬀ of the substrate is given in
Fig. 4. The permittivity component perpendicular to ﬁlm layers is assumed to be dispersion-
free and is estimated ǫeﬀ = 2.0(1
j0.01). Moreover, we load the antenna volume with a
reference dielectric substrate oﬀering the same size reduction.

We have chosen 580 MHz for the center frequency of the miniaturization scheme. This frequency
has strongly increasing practical importance since it corresponds to the center frequency of the
Digital Video Broadcast (DVB) system [46]. As discussed in the previous section, for the prac-
tical utilization of composite substrates containing natural magnetic inclusions the frequency
should not be too high due to rapidly increasing losses. For comparison, a demonstration for
the applicability of a substrate containing sheets of Z-type hexaferrite was conducted at 277
MHz [19].

4.1 Lossless substrate

We start the analysis by calculating the impedance bandwidth properties when the antenna
is loaded with lossless substrates. We see that at 580 MHz µ′
eﬀ ∼= 1.461. The value for the
relative permittivity of the reference substrate is found to be ǫ′
ref = 2.93. The dimensions of
the loaded patches are the following: l = w = 163 mm, h = 15 mm, l′ = 15 mm. Feed strip
width w′ is used to tune the quality of coupling T [47] in diﬀerent loading scenarios. We use
a
6 dB matching criterion to deﬁne the impedance bandwidth. The corresponding voltage
wave standing ratio S = 3. To allow a proper comparison between the impedance bandwidth

r = 0.69, while the TL-model predicts Qrel

analytical expression for the relative radiation quality factor: For the substrate used in the TL-
model eq. (13) gives Qrel
r = 0.73. It is physically clear
that the TL-model predicts a larger Qrel
: The analytical expression does not take into account
r
the feed strip which can be regarded as an eﬀective inductor [28]. Moreover, due to the feed
strip usually a patch antenna operates slightly above it’s parallel resonance. This means that
the standing wave pattern in the TL-model is not the “optimal” (parallel resonance) pattern
for magnetic loading [28].

The present result validates our previous discussion: The dispersion characteristics of the pro-
posed substrate are advantageous in antenna miniaturization. However, to draw a conclusion
on the practical applicability of the proposed substrate, realistic losses have to be taken into
account.

Losses in the substrate rather strongly degrade the radiation eﬃciency. The magnetic loss
tangent is tan δµ = 0.0284 at 580 MHz. Compared to the loss tangents of conventional high
quality dielectrics the value seems high. However, for comparison, the magnetic loss tangent
of a substrate containing sheets of Z-type hexaferrite was reported to be tan δm = 0.019 at 277
MHz [19]. Moreover, 580 MHz is a fairly high frequency for the utilization of a substrate con-
taining natural magnetic constituents. Based on the above discussion we consider the radiation
eﬃciency promisingly high. The most important result is that the radiation quality factor is
noticeably smaller than with pure dielectrics even in the presence of realistic losses. This means
that the antenna miniaturized using the proposed substrate operates closer to the fundamental
small antenna limit, thus its size-bandwidth characteristics are better.

4.3 Estimate for ηr as a function of magnetic loss tangent

There is no theory for the magnetic loss tangent of composites ﬁlled with thin ferromagnetic
ﬁlms. Therefore, we assume that with future technology the loss tangent can be brought down.
Here we estimate what kind of radiation eﬃciencies can be achieved with diﬀerent magnetic loss
tangents tan δµ. We use two diﬀerent techniques to estimate the eﬃciency: 1) Q0 is calculated
using the TL-model and we use (16) to estimate Qr when the loss tangents are known. The
radiation eﬃciency is then calculated using (15). 2) The numerical Wheeler Cap method is used
to estimate the radiation eﬃciency. When calculating Q0 the dielectric loss tangent is assumed
to be zero for the sake of clarity. With a given tan δǫ the radiation eﬃciency can conveniently
be estimated using (16) and (15) when Q0 and tan δµ are known. The result for the estimation
is depicted in Fig. 7.

5 Conclusion

In this paper we have discussed antenna miniaturization using magneto-dielectric substrates.
The eﬀect of antenna substrate to the radiation quality factor has been presented.
It has
been shown that natural magnetic constituents have to be embedded into the substrate in
order to gain advantages over conventional dielectric substrates. Detailed discussion has been
presented concerning antenna substrates containing natural magnetic inclusions. Moreover, we
have introduced a layered substrate containing thin ferromagnetic ﬁlms as a prospective antenna
substrate, and treated limitations for the obtainable permeability values. Using a transmission-
line model we have compared the impedance bandwidth properties of antennas loaded with the
proposed substrate and a conventional dielectric substrate. The results show that in terms of
minimized radiation quality factor the proposed substrate outperforms conventional dielectric
substrates. Estimates for the radiation eﬃciency are given as function of the magnetic loss
tangent.

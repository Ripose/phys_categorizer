The Maxwell equations for the spherical components of the electromagnetic ﬁelds outside sources
do not separate into equations for each component alone. We show, however, that general solutions
can be obtained by separation of variables in the case of azimuthal symmetry. Boundary condi-
tions are easier to apply to these solutions, and their forms highlight the similarities and diﬀerences
between the electric and magnetic cases in both time-independent and time-dependent situations.
Instructive examples of direct calculation of electric and magnetic ﬁelds from localized charge and
current distributions are presented.

Keywords: Maxwell equations; spherical coordinates; electric and magnetic ﬁelds; boundary-value
problems.

where the source terms ρ and J describe the densities
of electric charge and current, respectively. For a linear,
isotropic medium D and H are connected with the basic
ﬁelds E and B by the constitutive relations

D = ǫE, H = B/µ,

where ǫ and µ are the permittivity and permeability of
the medium, respectively.

The boundary conditions for ﬁelds at a boundary sur-

Changes in the electromagnetic ﬁelds propagate with
speed v = 1/√ǫµ .

Without any loss of generality, we may consider only

harmonic time dependence for sources and ﬁelds:
J(r, t) = J(r)e−iωt,

ρ(r, t) = ρ(r)e−iωt,

E(r, t) = E(r)e−iωt, B(r, t) = B(r)e−iωt,

(6)

where the real part of each expression is implied. Equa-
tion (4) then becomes time-independent:

2E + k2 E = 0,

2B + k2 B = 0,

(7)

∇

∇

where k2 = ǫµω2. These are vector Helmholtz equations
for transverse ﬁelds having zero divergence. Their solu-
tions subject to arbitrary boundary conditions are con-
sidered more complicated than those of the correspond-
ing scalar equations, since only in Cartesian coordinates
the Laplacian of a vector ﬁeld is the vector sum of the
Laplacian of its separated components. For spherical co-
ordinates, as for any other curvilinear coordinate system,
we are faced with a highly complicated set of three si-
multaneous equations, each equation involving all three
components of the vector ﬁeld. This complication is well
known and general techniques for solving these equa-
tions have been developed, based on a dyadic Green’s
function which transforms the boundary conditions and
source densities into the vector solution [3]. We shall
show, however, that in the case of spherical boundary
conditions with azimuthal symmetry, the solution can be
obtained more conveniently by means of separation of
variables. Several applications of physical interest can
then be treated in this simpliﬁed way, so avoiding the
dyadic method [4].

Actually, the usual technique for solving boundary-
value problems introduces the electromagnetic potentials
as intermediary ﬁeld quantities. These are deﬁned by [5]

which together with the Lorentz condition form a set
of equations equivalent to the Maxwell equations. The
boundary conditions for the potentials may be deduced
from Eq. (3).

For ﬁelds that vary with an angular frequency ω, i.e.

φ(r, t) = φ(r)e

−iωt, A(r, t) = A(r)e

−iωt,

(11)

we get equations that do not depend on time in regions
free of charge and current:

2φ + k2 φ = 0,

∇

∇

2A + k2 A = 0,

(12)

which are like those in Eq. (7) for the electric and mag-
netic induction ﬁelds, so that in general we also confront,
for the vector potential, the mathematical complexities
mentioned above for the electromagnetic ﬁelds.

The purpose of this paper is to get general solutions
of the electromagnetic vector equations in spherical co-
ordinates with azimuthal symmetry using separation of
variables in spite of having equations that mix ﬁeld com-
ponents. Boundary conditions are easier to apply to
these solutions, and their forms highlight the similari-
ties and diﬀerences between the electric and magnetic
cases in both time-independent and time-dependent sit-
uations. The approach shows that boundary-value prob-
lems can be solved for the electric and magnetic vector
ﬁelds directly, and that the process involves the same
kind of mathematics as the usual approach of solving for
potentials. The material in this work may be used in a
beginning graduate course in classical electromagnetism
or mathematical methods for physicists. It is organized

2. STATIC FIELDS

For steady-state electric and magnetic phenomena, the
ﬁelds outside sources satisfy the vector Laplace equations

2E = 0,

2B = 0,

∇

∇

(13)

where only transverse components with zero divergence
are involved. Supposing all the charge and current are on
the bounding surfaces, solutions in diﬀerent regions can
be connected through the boundary conditions indicated
in Eq. (3). To demonstrate the features of the treat-
ment, we ﬁrst consider boundary-value problems with
azimuthal symmetry in electrostatics. The solution of
stationary current problems in magnetostatics is mathe-
matically identical.

Combining the expressions for

E) = 0 and
E = 0 in spherical coordinates and assuming no ϕ-
∇ ·
dependence, we ﬁnd using Eq. (5) that the components
of the electric ﬁeld Er and Eθ satisfy the equations

In this paper, however, we will not be concerned about
those cylindrical symmetry cases where only the ϕ-
component of the vector ﬁeld is nonzero because a scalar
technique of separation of variables is already known to
obtain the solution [6].

(18)

which is consistent with Eq. (15). Thus, to obtain Eθ
from Er we can consider either Eq. (17) or Eq. (18).
These equations correspond to choosing a gauge when
this method is applied to the vector potential.

Now, in order to solve Eq. (14) for Er, we refer to the
method of separation of variables and write the product
form

which leads to the following separated diﬀerential equa-
tions:

Er(r, θ) =

(21)

where n(n + 1) is the separation constant. The solution
of Eq. (20) is

u(r) = a rn+1 +

b
rn ,

where a and b are arbitrary constants. Equation (21)
is the Legendre equation of order n and the only solu-
tion which is single valued, ﬁnite and continuous over the
whole interval corresponds to the Legendre polynomial
Pn(cos θ), n being restricted to positive integer values.
Thus the general solution for Er is

Er(r, θ) =

Pn(cos θ).

the absence of static ﬁeld terms of the 1/r type, which
are in reality typical of radiative ﬁelds as shown below.
Clearly, the solutions given in Eqs. (23), (24) and (25)
satisfy Eq. (18). The coeﬃcients an and bn are to be de-
termined from the boundary conditions. For complete-
ness, we include here the well-behaved general solution
of Eq. (16):

Eϕ(r, θ) =

Pn(cos θ).

Thus, Eqs. (23)-(26) formally give all three components
of the electric ﬁeld. The same type of equations applies
in magnetostatics. However, the boundary conditions of
Eq. (3) will make the diﬀerence, implying in particular
that b◦ = 0 in the series expansion of Eq. (23) in magne-
tostatics; this being primarily related to the absence of
magnetic monopoles.

To illustrate the use of the above formulas, we consider
the simple example of the electric ﬁeld due to a ring of
radius a with total charge Q uniformly distributed and
lying in the x-y plane. It is usually solved through the
scalar potential method by using the result of the po-
tential along the z-axis obtained from Coulomb’s law [7].
The surface charge density on r = a, localized at θ = π/2,
is written as

ρS(a, θ) =

Q
2πa2 δ(cos θ),

(27)

which may be expanded using the well-known Legendre
series

(29)

Taking into account the cylindrical symmetry of the sys-
tem, and the requirement that the series solutions in
Eqs. (23)-(25) have to be ﬁnite at the origin, vanish at
inﬁnity and satisfy the boundary conditions of Eq. (3)
at r = a for all values of the angle θ, namely, Eθ con-
tinuous at r = a and Er discontinuous at r = a, it is
straightforwardly found that the spherical components
of the electric ﬁeld are

and Eϕ = 0, where P 1
n(cos θ) = (d/dθ) Pn(cos θ) is an
associated Legendre function. Note in particular that the
coeﬃcient b◦ in Eq. (23) becomes Q/4πǫ◦ for r > a, as
expected. Also, the discontinuity of the nth component
of Er in Eq. (30) at r = a is connected according to
Eq. (3) with the corresponding component of the surface
charge density ρS obtained from Eqs. (27) and (28), ex-
hibiting the unity of the multipole expansions of ﬁelds
and sources (see Ref. [8]).

To clarify the application of the formulas in the case of
magnetostatics and also compare with electrostatics, we
consider next the magnetic analog of the above example,
that is, the magnetic induction ﬁeld from a circular cur-
rent loop of radius a lying in the x-y plane and carrying a
constant current I. The surface current density on r = a
can be written as

JS(a, θ, ϕ) =

Note that, as anticipated for magnetostatic problems, the
coeﬃcient b◦ in Eq. (23) is equal to zero. Also, as ex-
pected, the discontinuity of the nth component of Bθ in
Eq. (36) at r = a is connected according to Eq. (3) with
the corresponding component of the surface current den-
sity JSϕ obtained from Eqs. (32) and (33). Another char-
acteristic diﬀerence with the electrostatic analog is that
the coeﬃcient P 1
n(0) appears instead of Pn(0). This can
be traced to the fact that the inhomogeneous boundary
condition, as given by Eq. (3), is applied to the angular
component of the magnetic induction ﬁeld in Eqs. (24)-
(25), as opposed to the corresponding inhomogeneous
boundary condition acting on the radial component of
the electric ﬁeld in Eq. (23). The ﬁelds in Eqs. (35)-
(36) are usually obtained through the vector potential
method by using the expression of the magnetic induc-
tion ﬁeld along the z-axis calculated from the Biot and
Savart law [6]. An alternative technique is mere integra-
tion of the vector potential [9]. Our treatment has the
advantage of introducing a considerable simpliﬁcation on
the procedure of applying the boundary conditions on
the magnetic induction ﬁeld directly.

Because of the cylindrical symmetry of the system, Bϕ =
0. By requiring that the ﬁeld be ﬁnite at the origin,
vanish at inﬁnity and satisfy the boundary conditions of
Eq. (3) at r = a, the series solutions in Eqs. (23)-(25)
for the magnetic case lead to the following radial and
angular components of the magnetic induction ﬁeld:

Br(r, θ) =

P 1

n(0) Pn(cos θ)

By using Eqs. (1), (2) and (6) it is seen that outside

sources the ﬁelds are related by

E =

we can solve for E, and obtain B through the expression

In the following, we choose to deal with the Helmholtz
equation for the magnetic induction ﬁeld. The reason is
to exhibit similarities and diﬀerences with the static case
treated in Sec. 2.

In the case of spherical boundary surfaces with az-
imuthal symmetry, the Br and Bθ components of the

and Bϕ = 0, where the upper line holds for r > a and
the lower line for r < a. As noted above, the coeﬃcient

of the nth component of Bθ in Eq. (50) at r = a is con-
nected, according to Eq. (3), with the nth component of
the surface current density JSϕ obtained from Eqs. (48)
and (33). A characteristic diﬀerence between this time-
varying problem and the corresponding static case is the
appearance of the spherical Bessel functions, which are
solutions of the radial part of the Helmholtz equation in
spherical coordinates. Using their limiting values [10], it
can be seen that for k

and (36) are obtained, as mathematically and physically
expected. On the other hand, the radiative part of the

The magnetic induction ﬁeld in Eqs. (49) and (50) can be
seen to be just that which is obtained with the more ar-
duous technique of a dyadic Green’s function expanded in

vector spherical harmonics and applied to the vector po-
tential, which, by symmetry, only has the ϕ-component
diﬀerent from zero [3]. As we have shown, a direct
calculation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld with r- and θ-
components is much simpliﬁed if separation of variables
is used.

4. CONCLUSION

For spherical coordinate systems, the Maxwell equa-
tions outside sources lead to coupled equations involving
all three components of the electromagnetic ﬁelds.
In
general, the statement is that one cannot separate spher-
ical components of the Maxwell equations, and extensive
techniques for solving the vector equations have been de-
veloped which introduce vector spherical harmonics and
use dyadic methods. We have shown, however, that sepa-
ration of variables is still possible in the case of azimuthal
symmetry, and so general solutions for each component of
the electromagnetic vector ﬁelds were obtained. We have

illustrated the use of these formulas with direct calcula-
tions of electric and magnetic induction ﬁelds from local-
ized charge and current distributions, without involving
the electromagnetic potentials. Boundary conditions are
easier to apply to these solutions, and their forms high-
light the similarities and diﬀerences between the electric
and magnetic cases in both time-independent and time-
dependent situations. Finally, we remark that in cylin-
drical coordinates, the other commonly used curvilinear
coordinate system, the Maxwell equations do separate
into equations for each vector component alone if there
is cylindrical symmetry, so that the method of separation
of variables can be used directly.

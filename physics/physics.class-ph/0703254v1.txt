Comment on “How the potentials in diﬀerent gauges
yield the same retarded electric and magnetic ﬁelds,”
by J. A. Heras [Am. J. Phys. 75, 176 (2007)]

In a recent paper,1 Heras surveys the Lorenz, Coulomb, Kirchhoﬀ, velocity, and temporal gauges
with a view to explaining how the potentials of all these gauges yield the same retarded electro-
magnetic ﬁeld, despite the fact that these potentials may satisfy dynamical equations that do not
admit properly retarded solutions. He claims to show without actually solving the equations that
the potentials satisfy that the “spurious” non-causal term generated by the scalar potential of the
Coulomb, Kirchhoﬀ, or velocity gauge is canceled by an equal and opposite term in the contribution
to the electric ﬁeld that is generated by the vector potential. With no intention of diminishing the
value of the gauge survey itself, we argue that, given the deﬁnitions of the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds in terms of electromagnetic potentials, Heras’s cancelation of a non-causal term in the electric
ﬁeld is an artefact of algebraic manipulation that has no explanatory content.

Heras manipulates the equations that, for example, the potentials ΦC and AC of the Coulomb

gauge satisfy in four distinct steps, which in the end lead to inhomogeneous wave equations

He then writes the retarded solution −∇ΦC − ∂AC /∂t of (1) as

since the instantaneous term −∇ΦC in −∇ΦC − ∂AC/∂t is canceled by an equal and opposite term
in −∂AC/∂t of (3). Because of this cancelation, Heras calls the term −∇ΦC a “spurious” ﬁeld,
which has only a “mathematical”, but not “physical” existence.

We note ﬁrst that Heras’s four steps are not needed to obtain the wave equations (1) and (2)
— Maxwell’s equations lead directly, without the aid of any potentials, to inhomogeneous wave
equations for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds themselves:2

Equations (1)–(3) then follow immediately on the use in Eqs. (5)–(7) of the deﬁnitions

where Φ and A are potentials in an arbitrary gauge. Heras has to employ the deﬁnitions (9) and
(10) already when he derives from Maxwell’s equations the dynamical equations for the potentials
of the gauges he considers. The retarded solution (3), written in the usual manner, thus holds in
an arbitrary gauge:

Equations (7)–(10) ensure that, irrespective of the gauge used, the retarded electromagnetic
ﬁeld is given uniquely by its sources ρ and J, but do not help to answer the perhaps superﬂuous,
but still intriguing, question how that can happen when the potentials themselves are solutions of
dynamical equations that do not admit properly retarded solutions. Only constructive solutions of
the dynamical equations for the potentials in terms of the sources ρ and J can help in this regard,
like, for example, the solution obtained by Jackson3 for the Coulomb-gauge vector potential AC,

Here, the retarded terms in the integrand give Jeﬁmenko’s expression for the retarded electric ﬁeld,4
while the last term yields an instantaneous term ∇ΦC, which will be canceled by the equal and
opposite term in (9).

In contrast, it is not diﬃcult to see that the cancelation of the term −∇ΦC in E by an equal
and opposite term in −∂AC/∂t obtained by Heras is merely an artefact of writing, in Eq. (3), the
retarded solution of the inhomogeneous wave equation (1), which is the retarded electric ﬁeld E
of Eq. (4), as −∂AC/∂t = E + ∇ΦC. Using the Lorenz-gauge potentials ΦL and AL in Eqs. (9)
and (11), one could argue `a la Heras that the retarded term −∇ΦL in E is also a “spurious” ﬁeld
because it is canceled by an equal and opposite term in −∂AL/∂t, the arbitrary exclusion by Heras
of the Lorenz gauge from the four steps of his method notwithstanding. In general, neither of the
potential-generated terms −∇Φ and −∂A/∂t alone represents a physical ﬁeld, but that does not
mean that any of these terms can be regarded as spurious because both are needed in the sum
−∇Φ − ∂A/∂t that is guaranteed by the mathematical consistency of the electromagnetic-potential
method of solving Maxwell’s equations to yield the physical electric ﬁeld E.

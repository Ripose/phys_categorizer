Abstract

Classical electrodynamics can be based on the conservation laws
of electric charge and magnetic ﬂux. Both laws are independent of the
metric and the linear connection of spacetime. Within the framework
of such a premetric electrodynamics — provided a local and linear
constitutive law of the vacuum is added — the propagation of elec-
tromagnetic waves in the geometric-optics limit can be studied. The
wave vectors of the wave fronts obey a quartic extended Fresnel equa-
tion. If one forbids birefringence in vacuum, the light cone emerges
and Maxwell-Lorentz vacuum electrodynamics can be recovered. If
minimal coupling of electrodynamics to gravity is assumed, then only
the gravitational potential, i.e., the metric of spacetime, emerges in
the constitutive law. We discuss recent results within this general
framework.

Introduction

Premetric classical electrodynamics has been consistently formulated in
2003 in the book of Hehl and Obukhov [2]. Related developments can
be found in the recent books of Lindell [3] and Russer [4] and the articles
of Delphenich [5, 6]. One of the basic ideas is to formulate electrodynamics
in such a way that the metric of spacetime (that is, the gravitational po-
tential of Einstein’s theory of gravity) doesn’t enter the fundamental laws
of electrodynamics. The practicability of such an approach has been shown
in detail in [2], see also the earlier work of Toupin & Truesdell [7, 8], Post
[9, 10], Kiehn et al. [11], and Kovetz [12]. In this lecture, we concentrate
on the post 2003 development, for earlier results we refer to the extended
bibliography in [2].

After the publication of [2], premetric electrodynamics turned out to be
a lively and active subject. Mainly the following aspects were developed
(we order them roughly chronologically):

1. Inclusion of magnetic charges in a consistent and metric-free way by
Kaiser [13] and by Hehl and Obukhov [14], earlier work had been
done by Edelen [15].

2. Application of the premetric formalism to the Quantum Hall Eﬀect
and prediction of the independence of the QHE on an external grav-
itational by Hehl, Obukhov, and Rosenow [16].

3. Possible non-minimal coupling of gravity to electromagnetism, in par-
ticular to the torsion ﬁeld, by Solanki, Preuss, and Haugan [17, 18],
see also Hehl and Obukhov [19], and, subsequently, by using the for-
malism of [2], by Rubilar et al. [20] and by Itin et al. [21, 22].

4. Derivation of the signature of the metric of spacetime from the Lenz
rule (connected with Faraday’s induction law) by Itin et al. [23].

5. The Lorentz-violating CFJ-electrodynamics, see Carroll, Field, and
Jackiw [24], was reformulated in the premetric formalism by Itin [25].
It enhances the transparency of the CFJ-approach.

6. New derivation by L¨ammerzahl et al. [26], see also [27], of the metric
from linear premetric electrodynamics: We forbid birefringence in
vacuum.

7. New insight in the physical dimensions of electrodynamics and in
the time variability of the vacuum impedance and the ﬁne structure
constant by Tobar [28] and Hehl & Obukhov [29].

8. Eﬀect of the skewon ﬁeld on light propagation in an quite detailed

article by Obukhov et al. [30].

9. Relation between axion electrodynamics, see Wilczek [31], and the
so-called Post constraint, see Hehl and Obukhov [32]; compare the
perfect electromagnetic conductor (PEMC) of Lindell and Sihvola
[33, 34]. Scattering of electromagnetic ﬁelds at the PEMC.

10. Symbol and hyperbolic polynomials of the wave equation and its re-

lation to premetric electrodynamics as discussed by Beig [35].

11. Nonlinear electrodynamics by Delphenich [36], see also [37, 38].

We will now integrate these topics into a short systematic review of

premetric electrodynamics.

2 Axiom 1: Electric charge conservation

We base electrodynamics on electric charge conservation. The conserva-
tion of electric charge was already recognized as fundamental law during
the time of Franklin (around 1750) well before Coulomb discovered his force
law in 1785. Nowadays, at a time, at which one can catch single electrons
and single protons in traps and can count them individually, we are more
sure than ever that electric charge conservation is a valid fundamental law
of nature. Therefore matter carries as a primary quality something called
electric charge which only occurs in positive or negative units of an elemen-
tary charge e (or, in the case of quarks, in 1/3th of it) and which can be
counted in principle. Thus it is justiﬁed to introduce the physical dimension
of charge q as a new and independent concept.

Mathematically, the ﬁrst axiom is most conveniently formulated in
terms of exterior calculus with the help of the 3-form J of electrical cur-
rent. Its integral over an arbitrary 3-dimensional domain describes the total
charge contained therein. It can be determined by counting the particles
carrying an elementary charge. The latter can be taken as a unit of charge,
in the sense of the theory of dimensions. The conservation of the current
reads, in exterior calculus,

dJ = 0.
(1)
This law is metric-independent since it is based on a counting procedure for
elementary charges. Given a spacetime foliation, we can 1+3 decompose the
dσ + ρ into the 2-form of the electric current density j and
current J =
the 3-form ρ of the electric charge density. Then the charge conservation
law assumes a more familiar form of the continuity equation

where the dot denotes the time derivative (Lie derivative with respect to
a suitable vector ﬁeld) and d the 3-dimensional exterior derivative. Both
(1) and (2) can be equivalently formulated in the integral form, see [2] for
details.

4

F.W. Hehl, Y. Itin, and Yu.N. Obukhov

Because of the ﬁrst axiom and according to a theorem of de Rham,
we can represent the conserved electric current as an exterior derivative (a
generalized “divergence”), i.e.,

J = dH .

(3)

In this way, we naturally introduce the 2-form H of the electromagnetic
excitation. Certainly, this quantity is not uniquely determined from (3)
H + dψ evidently preserves the form of (3).
since the transformation H
However, this arbitrariness is eventually ﬁxed in the actual measurements
performed with the help of ideal conductors and superconductors, which
means that the electromagnetic excitation does have a direct operational
signiﬁcance, see Raith [39].

The (1 + 3)-decomposition of H is obtained similarly to the decompo-
of the electric

sition of the current J, thereby introducing the 2-form
excitation (historical name: “dielectric displacement”) and the 1-form
of the magnetic excitation (“magnetic ﬁeld”):

Charge conservation is a law that is valid in macro- as well as in micro-
physics. If charge conservation was violated, we could introduce a 4-form
N (one component only!) according to dJ = N . L¨ammerzahl, Macias,
and M¨uller [40] studied a seemingly more restricted class of models vio-
lating charge conservation. Such models can be used as test theories for
experiments on the checking of charge conservation.

3 Axiom 2: Lorentz force density

With charge conservation alone, we arrived at the inhomogeneous Maxwell
equations (3). Now we need some more input for deriving the homogeneous
Maxwell equations. In the purely electric case with a test charge q, we have
in terms of components

simplest relativistic ansatz for deﬁning the electromagnetic ﬁeld reads:

∂L/∂xi is

h is not the Planck constant but rather only denotes its dimension).@@@
Accordingly, with the covectorial force density fα, the ansatz (7) can be
made more precise. The Lorentz force density acting on a charge density
is encoded into Axiom 2:

Here eα is an arbitrary, i.e., anholonomic frame or tetrad, a basis of the
tangent space, with α = 0, 1, 2, 3, and
denotes the interior product (con-
traction). The axiom (8) should be read as an operational procedure for
deﬁning the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength 2-form F in terms of the force
density fα, known from mechanics, and the current density J, known from
charge conservation. The 1 + 3 decomposition of F reads

three dimensions. Analogously — apart from the fact that J is a 3-form
B represents the magnetic ﬂux and B the magnetic
and F a 2-form —
ﬂux density. Consequently, E has to be interpreted as the current of the
magnetic ﬂux density. We could call F the (four dimensional) current of
magnetic ﬂux.

Why isn’t that conventionally presented in textbooks in this way? There
seem to be two reasons: (i) In textbooks the 4-dimensional point of view is
only a supplementary structure which is used eventually in order to crown
the development of electromagnetism, whereas we take, in the approach
presented, the 4-dimensional view on electromagnetism as fundamental and
indispensable right from the beginning. (ii) A “charge” density is assumed
intuitively to be a 3-form, i.e., one has to integrate the charge density over
a 3-volume in order to ﬁnd a net charge. This is a widespread prejudice.
However, also a 2-form like B, if integrated over a 2-dimensional surface, can
be considered to be a “charge” (here the magnetic ﬂux) and, accordingly,
a 1-form like E as the corresponding “current density” (here the current of
the magnetic ﬂux density). Therefore, Axiom 1 in local form, dJ = 0, as
electric charge conservation, has as analog — in local form —

dF = 0

d B = 0 ,
˙B + d E = 0 ,

(

(10)

6

F.W. Hehl, Y. Itin, and Yu.N. Obukhov

the law of magnetic ﬂux conservation. Since the Faraday induction law
and the sourcelessness of B are consequences of (10), this axiom has a ﬁrm
experimental underpinning. Note that the induction law has the form of a
continuity equation for the “charge density” B.

Nevertheless, similar as with the possible violation of electric charge
conservation, there have been numerous attempts to postulate the existence
of magnetic charge according to

dF = K

d B = ρmg ,
˙B + d E = jmg ,

(

(11)

with the magnetic current density K =

jmg ∧

dσ + ρmg.

It has been shown by Edelen [15], and more completely by Kaiser [13]
and two of us [14], that the law (11) can be made to ﬁt into the premetric
approach, provided electric charge conservation is fulﬁlled.

Clearly,

if besides the electric charge ρel, a magnetic charge ρmg is
present, we have to expect that the electromagnetic ﬁeld exerts a force
[F ], which enters the Lorentz force
on it. The absolute dimension [J]
magnetic ﬂux = action. The same dimen-
density (8), is electric charge
[H], namely [K] = magnetic ﬂux
sion can be found for the expression [K]
and [H] = electric charge. We recognize here a certain reciprocity between
electricity and magnetisms. The revised Axiom 2, taking into account the
linearity of electrodynamics, would then read

The necessity of the minus sign will be explained in the next section. There
it will also be shown that the expression for the energy-momentum current
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld remains the same, with or without magnetic
charge, a quite remarkable fact that enables us to revise the premetric ax-
iomatics in such a way as to accommodate the possible existence of magnetic
charge.

However, we shouldn’t forget that all experiments done so far attest to
the absence of magnetic charge. Hence the experimental situation leaves
no doubt about the absence of magnetic charge in nature. Even more so,
theoretical reasons make such a structure also implausible: The modiﬁed
Axiom 2, see (12), could no longer be read as a clear cut operational def-
inition of the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength F . It would mix with H in a
rather confusing way.

In the 19th and the ﬁrst half of the 20th century, in spite of Amp`ere’s
hypothesis of the electric origin of magnetic eﬀects — which today is no
longer a hypothesis but rather an experimental fact — magnetostatics was
built up in analogy to electrostatics. The force on the ﬁctitious magnetic

charges were then given by ρmg ∧ H
of the last term of the right-hand-side of (12). This is the reason why
was called the magnetic ﬁeld strength in analogy to the electric ﬁeld
H
E as Lorentz force density, even though the magnetic
strength E, with ρel ∧
charges were assumed to be ﬁctitious. We recognize here once more that
the premetric formalism induces transparency into electrodynamics.

5 Axiom 4: Energy-momentum current

The ﬁeld equations of electrodynamics dH = J and dF = 0 have been
set up. Now we have to turn to the energy-momentum distribution in
the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Since the Lorentz force density (8) [or (12)]
determines the relation between the electromagnetic ﬁeld and mechanics,
this formula must be the starting point for a discussion of energy and
momentum. If we introduce for the magnetic piece in (12) a factor β, to
be determined later, then

Note, however, that this equation is also valid for ordinary electrodynamics
(without magnetic charges) since under those conditions dF = 0. In other
words, (14) is valid in both cases, with or without magnetic charges. The
same will be true for the subsequent formulas.

As we mentioned above, also this formula is correct with and without
magnetic charges as long as electric charge conservation dJ = 0 is taken
for granted. Without magnetic charge the last term drops out because
of dF = 0. Then the choice of β = 1 yields the conventional energy-
momentum current of Minkowski. With magnetic charge the last term
disturbs the whole set up. We cannot ﬁnd a reasonable energy-momentum
1 would trivi-
current in this case unless we put β =
alize (18) to a mathematical identity and the Lorentz force density would
be lost. Hence β = +1 is the only reasonable option. In other words, we
choose β = 1 in (13) thus arriving at what we displayed already in (12).

For the derivation of the energy-momentum current, we could alternatively
require (21) right from the beginning. Then the ﬁrst line in (20) is rea-
sonable because of the exterior derivative, the second line has to emerge
because of the Lie derivative (in a special frame it is zero). Accordingly,
the third line has to be zero.

The energy-momentum current (22) in premetric exterior calculus has
also been derived by Lindell & Jancewicz [42], Segev [43], and Kaiser [13],
see also the modiﬁed derivation by Itin et al. [21, 23].

The energy-momentum localization, as speciﬁed in (22), represents our
Axiom 4. The current kΣα is electric/magnetic reciprocal under the sub-
1
stitutions H
ζ H, with an arbitrary pseudo-scalar function
ζ, as discussed in detail in [2]. There it is also shown that Xα vanishes in

Riemannian spacetime, that is, in special relativity theory (SR) and in
general relativity theory (GR), and even in a spacetime possibly carrying
torsion and/or nonmetricity. Therefore Maxwell’s equations in the form of
(5) and (10) represent the optimal formulation of the fundamental laws of
classical electrodynamics. Nonminimal couplings, which induce additional
fundamental constants, will be discussed in Sec.12. In order to complete
the theory, we need a relation between H and F , which we will discuss in
the next section. However, before that we will have a look at dimensional
analysis, today a largely neglected subject.

D

H

] = q and [

In accordance with the general dimensional analysis of Schouten and
Dorgelo, see [44], and, in particular, of Post [9], the absolute dimension
of J is that of a charge:
[J] = q (since the integral of the current over a
3-dimensional spatial domain yields the total charge). Since the exterior
derivative is dimensionless, [d] = 1, and since the electromagnetic excitation
is given by the inhomogeneous Maxwell equation (3), we conclude that the
absolute dimension of the excitation [H] = q. Then, by means of (4), the
absolute dimensions of the electric and magnetic excitations turn out to
] = q/t. The relative dimensions are those of their
be [
H
ab] = q/ℓ2, with the spatial indices
frame components, [
a, b = 1, 2, 3. These are the “physical” dimensions known to physicists
and engineers. Furthermore, denoting the physical dimension of an action
by h, the Lorentz force equation (8) shows that the absolute dimension
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength 2-form F is [F ] = h/q = φ, that
is, action/charge or magnetic ﬂux φ, see [2]. Then by (9), the absolute
dimensions of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds E and B are [E] = φ/t
and [B] = φ, respectively, and the relative dimensions [Ea] = φ/(t ℓ) and
[Bab] = φ/ℓ2.

Our analysis does not make use of the metric. Moreover, it is generally
covariant and as such valid in particular in GR and SR. Furthermore it is
valid on a spacetime manifold of arbitrary dimension. And, on top of that,
our considerations do not depend on any particular choice of the system of
physical units. Whatever your favorite system of units may be, our results

generally covariant, dimensionally independent, and valid for any system

Quite remarkably, in 1+2 spacetime dimensions we can develop the com-
plete premetric phenomenological theory of the quantum Hall eﬀect (QHE)
that applies to the an electron gas system conﬁned to a 2-dimensional plane
[16]. The crucial observation is that in 1 + 2 dimensions, the current is a
2-form, and the natural constitutive relation, assuming isotropy, is then

J =

σH F.

(24)

−
From the Maxwell equations (3) and (10) we ﬁnd that σH is constant, and
the above dimensional analysis shows that it has the dimension of conduc-
tance. The additional microscopic study [16] supports these conclusions
and ultimately identiﬁes 1/σH with the von Klitzing constant RK.

Since such a phenomenological scheme is premetric, the gravitational
ﬁeld neither as metric nor as linear connection ever shows up in this the-
ory. This leads to the prediction that the QHE does not “feel” gravity. In

10

F.W. Hehl, Y. Itin, and Yu.N. Obukhov

particular, this means that the linear Hall resistance should remain con-
stant in an arbitrary noninertial frame and in any gravitational ﬁeld. An
experimental veriﬁcation of this prediction is highly desirable.

In contrast to the (1 + 2)-dimensional Hall electrodynamics, the elec-
trodynamical theory in 1 + 3 spacetime dimensions normally incorporates
the metric of a ﬂat or a curved spacetime via the constitutive relation
H = H(F ) between the excitation and the ﬁeld strength. In particular, the
standard Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics arises when we assume

H = λ0

⋆F .

(25)

Here the (4-dimensional) Hodge star ⋆ is deﬁned by the spacetime metric
gij which in Cartesian coordinates reads gij = diag(c2,
1). The
above dimensional analysis shows that Ω0 := 1/λ0 has the dimension of
resistance. Usually, it is called the vacuum impedance.

The Maxwell equations (3) and (10), together with the Maxwell-Lorentz
spacetime relation (25), constitute the foundations of classical electrody-
namics:

(26)
These laws, in the classical domain, are assumed to be of universal valid-
ity. Only if vacuum polarization eﬀects of quantum electrodynamics are
taken care of or if hypothetical nonlocal terms emerge due to huge acceler-
ations, the spacetime relation H = H(F ) can pick up corrections yielding
a nonlinear law.

dF = 0 .

We would like to stress that the presence of two fundamental constants
in the Maxwell-Lorentz theory, namely c and Ω0, is, in our opinion, very
much underestimated. A simple application can be given in the context of
of the possible variation of fundamental physical constants. The possibility
of time and space variations of the fundamental constants is discussed in
the literature both from an experimental and a theoretical point of view, see
[45, 46, 47], for example. Of particular interest are certain indications that
the ﬁne structure constant may slowly change on a cosmological time scale.
Some authors, see Peres [48, 49], for example, related some experimental
evidence of the variability of the ﬁne structure “constant” to the change of
the speed of light c = c(t, xa). However, a closer look at the deﬁnition of
the ﬁne structure constant

αf =

(27)

shows, see Tobar [28] and [29], that it is explicitly given in terms of the ratio
of two resistances — vacuum impedance Ω0 and von Klitzing constant RK
(the quantum Hall resistance). Note that the speed of light c disappeared
completely! Tobar [28] demonstrated explicitly that (27) doesn’t depend on
the system of units. This is inbuilt in our formalism right from its axiomatic
beginnings [2].

impedance that enters the ﬁne structure constant and not the speed of
light. Accordingly, a variation of the ﬁne structure constant αf = αf (t)
would force us to conclude that most probably λ0 = λ0(t). A similar for-
malism was actually developed by Bekenstein [50], although he inclines to
a diﬀerent physical interpretation of a variable electron charge e. Since a
variable e and/or h would yield to charge and/or ﬂux violation, at least one
Maxwell equation had to be given up. Since we consider this undesirable,
we opt for λ0 = λ0(t).

7 Axiom 5: Local and linear spacetime relation

A local and linear spacetime relation appears to be a reasonable physical
assumption in the general setting of the axiomatic approach. Then, the
electromagnetic excitation and the ﬁeld strength are related by the local

The constitutive tensor κ has 36 independent components. One can decom-
pose this object into its irreducible pieces. Obviously, within the premetric
framework, contraction is the only tool for such a decomposition. Following
Post [10], we can deﬁne the contracted tensor of type [1

with 16 independent components. The second contraction yields the pseudo-

the axion ﬁelds are introduced by

8 Light propagation in vacuum

Birefringence eﬀects are usually studied in the geometric optics approxi-
mation. It is equivalent to the Hadamard approach, where one studies the
propagation of a discontinuity in the ﬁrst derivative of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. The basic notions are then the ﬁelds of the wave covector and the
ray vector that encode the information about the propagation of a wave in
a spacetime with a general constitutive relation.

The crucial observation about the surface of discontinuity S (deﬁned
locally by a function Φ such that Φ = const on S) is that across S the ge-
ometric Hadamard conditions are satisﬁed for the components of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld and their derivatives: [Fij] = 0, [∂iFjk] = qi fjk, [Hij] =

0, [∂iHjk] = qi hjk. Here qi := ∂iΦ is the wave covector. Then using the
Maxwell equations (3) and (10) and the constitutive law (28), we ﬁnd a
system of algebraic equations for the jump functions:

χ ijkl qj fkl = 0 ,

ǫ ijkl qj fkl = 0 .

Solving the last equation in (53) by means of fij = qiaj
the gauge invariance ai

χ ijkl qjqkal = 0 .
This algebraic system, with the mentioned inbuilt gauge invariance, has a
nontrivial solution for ai only if the determinant of the matrix on the left
hand side vanishes. After removing the gauge freedom in the determinant
[2], we arrive at the 4-dimensionally invariant extended Fresnel equation

tributes to (56) as follows:

Birefringence (or double refraction) is the direct physical consequence
of the Fresnel equation. In this case the quartic wave covector surface (55)
reduces to the pair of second order light-cones. However, the inﬂuence of
a skewon ﬁeld on the Fresnel wave surface is qualitatively diﬀerent: The
characteristic sign of the skewon is the emergence of the speciﬁc holes in
the quartic Fresnel surfaces that correspond to the directions in space along
which the wave propagation is damped out completely [30]. This eﬀect is
in complete agreement with our earlier conclusion on the dissipative nature
of the skewon ﬁeld [2, 38].

9 No birefringence and the light cone

It has been shown recently [26] that taking the linear spacetime relation
for granted, one ends up at a Riemannian lightcone provided one forbids
birefringence in vacuum, see also [53]. For this the covariant equation (55)

M0 q4

0 + M1 q3

(58)
where the coeﬃcients Mi are homogeneous functions of degree i in the
spatial components qa. Due to Ferrari (1545), the four solutions of the
quartic equation (58) can be written as

where M a, M ab are constructed in terms of the components of χijkl, see [2].
Since this relation describes an unique light cone, it should be under-
stood, up to a scalar factor, as an operational deﬁnition of a Riemannian
metric. From the condition of the existence of a unique solution (or from
hyperbolicity, see Beig [35]), eq.(64) has to possess two real solutions for
any given qa. As a consequence, the signature of the metric is Lorentzian.
Accordingly, the signature of the metric is a consequence of the existence
of a unique real solution of the Maxwell equations in a future causal cone
for arbitrary sources with compact support.

An alternative treatment of the correlation between the linear consti-
tutive relations (28) and the signature is given by two of us in [23].

We introduced here the Time and Space factors iT, iS, hT, hSfT, , fS =

For all possible signatures of the 4-dimensional metric, we obtain the ex-
pressions for the electric and magnetic energy densities that correspond to
(22). The metric of a Lorentzian type turns out to be related to a positive
electromagnetic energy density. This result does not depend on the values
of the sign factors.

±

We analyzed the (1 + 3)-decompositions of the ﬁeld equations, and we
derived which sign factors are conventional and which do depend on the
signature. We ﬁnd that the electric charge has two possible signs for all
signatures. For all signatures, we determine the features of the interac-
tions between charges and between currents. Only for a metric with a
Lorentzian signature we have ordinary Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics.
In particular, it yields attraction between opposite charges and repulsion
between charges of the same sign: this is Dufay’s law. Also the magnetic
force has a correct sign. In particular, it is responsible for the pulling of
a ferromagnetic core into a solenoid independently of the direction of the
current, in accordance with Lenz’s rule. That is, we show in the metric-
free approach that positive electromagnetic energy density together with
the correct signs in Dufay’s and Lenz’s rules correspond to a Lorentzian
signature of the metric.

ﬁeld was Schr¨odinger [57], p.25, penultimate paragraph, and, as a non-
constant ﬁeld, Dicke [58]. The framework (68),(69) in fact corresponds to
Tellegen’s gyrator [59, 60] and to Lindell & Sihvola’s perfect electromagnetic
conductor (PEMC) [33, 34].

A further specialization of the axion electrodynamics is possible when
the covector ν := dα = νi dxi has constant components. In the cosmological
context, this yields the Lorentz-violating CFJ-electrodynamics, see Carroll,
Field, and Jackiw [24].

Even though in the extended Fresnel equation (55) the birefringence
eﬀect is independent of the axion ﬁeld, such a behavior was discovered in
[24]. In order to resolve this problem, we consider the standard wave ansatz

F = f eiϕ ,
(70)
where i is the imaginary unit and ϕ = ϕ(xk), while f is a constant 2-form.
We denote the wave covector as q = dϕ = qi dxi. For the ansatz (70), the
components of the excitation 2-form for the CFJ case become

ˇH kl = χklmn fmn eiϕ ,

(71)

with ˇH kl := ǫklmnHmn/2. In contrast to the Hadamard method, the am-
plitude of ˇH kl is not a constant, even if fmn, the amplitude of Fmn, is a
constant. Substituting (70) and (71) into the ﬁeld equations and putting
the current J to zero, we obtain a system of 8 linear equations

α(xm)ǫijkl. Following the procedure given in [2], we rewrite this equation

of the constitutive tensor.

11 Axiom 6: Splitting of the electric current

In order to discuss the electrodynamics of continuous media, we need some
further input. The crucial point is as follows: The total current density
is the sum of the two contributions originating “from the inside” of the
medium (which is interpreted as a bound or material charge) and “from
the outside” (which is free or external charge):

J = J mat + J ext.

(76)

Here, the bound electric current inside matter is denoted by mat and the
external current by ext. The same notational scheme is also applied to the
excitation H, so we have H mat and H ext.

Bound charges and bound currents are inherent characteristics of matter
determined by the medium itself. They only emerge inside the medium.
In contrast, free charges and free currents in general appear outside and
inside matter. They can be prepared for a speciﬁc purpose by a suitable
experimental arrangement (a beam of charged particles, say, and scatter
them at the medium), or we could study the reaction of a medium in
response to a prescribed conﬁguration of charges and currents, J ext.

Furthermore, we assume that the charge bound by matter fulﬁlls the

usual charge conservation law separately:

d J mat = 0.

(77)

We call (76) together with (77) Axiom 6.
It speciﬁes the properties of
the classical material medium. In view of the relation dJ = 0, resulting
from the ﬁrst axiom, the assumption (77) means that there is no physical
exchange (or conversion) between the bound and free charges. Although
the sixth axiom certainly does not exhaust all possible types of material
media, it is valid for a suﬃciently wide class of media.

Analogously to the Maxwell equation (3), which was derived from the
conservation law (1), we introduce by means of (77) the excitation H mat as
a “potential” for the bound current:

The (1 + 3)-decomposition, following the pattern of (4), yields

J mat = d H mat .

However, the equations in (83) refer only to the external ﬁelds and sources.
We stress that the homogeneous Maxwell equation remains valid in its
original form.

12 Coupling of electrodynamics to gravity

The coupling between the electromagnetic and the gravitational ﬁeld is an
age-old problem.
It is already related to the ﬁrst observable prediction
of GR about the bending of light rays of stars in the gravitational ﬁeld
of the Sun. The electromagnetic and gravitational eﬀects are of rather
diﬀerent orders of magnitude. However, the increasing precision of modern
experimental techniques gives rise to the hope that the appropriate form
of the coupling can soon be determined.

In particular, we have in this context two independent but closely re-

lated problems:

electric charge?

(i) How does the gravitational ﬁeld of a massive source depend on its

20

F.W. Hehl, Y. Itin, and Yu.N. Obukhov

(ii) How does the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a charged massive source change

when the gravity is “switched on”?

In most cases, the coupling between two ﬁelds can be represented by a spe-
ciﬁc term in the total action. This term has to respect the diﬀeomorphism
invariance related to gravity as well as the gauge invariance of electrody-
namics. Moreover, it is reasonable to require the main facts of both theories
(the conservation of energy-momentum, of electric charge, and of magnetic
ﬂux) to be preserved in the modiﬁed model. Although, coordinate and
gauge invariance strongly restrict the variety of admissible coupling terms,
we have still an inﬁnity set of possibilities. Indeed, we can always construct
a polynomial of a chosen coupling term. This new term can also serve as an
admissible additional piece of the action. Hence we will restrict ourselves
to the admissible parity conserving coupling terms of the lowest order, see
also [19].

Our main result will be that all such lowest order modiﬁcations of
the standard Einstein-Maxwell system are completely embedded in the ax-
iomatic approach to electrodynamics.

with m = GM/c2 and q2 = GQ2/(4πε0c4), describes a mass M with an
electric charge Q. The electromagnetic ﬁeld strength F is involved in (86)
only algebraically, that is, without derivatives. Hence the inhomogeneous
Maxwell equation can only be derived by a variation taken with respect to
the potential A.

Let us turn then to a discussion of the potential. In the conventional
textbook approach, see Landau and Lifshitz [61] and Misner, Thorne, and
Wheeler [62], the components Ai of the electromagnetic potential 1-form
A = Ai dxi are taken as ﬁeld variables. The recipe for the “minimal”
transition from SR to GR is then the “comma goes to semicolon rule”
[62]; the comma “,” denotes the partial, the semicolon “;” the covariant
derivative. For the components Fij of the ﬁeld strength F we ﬁnd then

Fij = Aj;i

Ai;j = Aj,i

Ai,j ,

−

−

(89)

since the Levi-Civita connection is symmetric. The relation between the
components Fij and Ai is then eventually recognized as independent of the
metric structure. Needless to say that such a procedure is highly coordinate
dependent.

In contrast, in our axiomatic approach the potential 1-form A, as (coor-
dinate independent) geometrical object, is the ﬁeld variable of our choice.
From magnetic ﬂux conservation we ﬁnd directly

F = dA ,

(90)

without messing around with covariant derivatives.
In this coordinate-
independent way we recognize right away that there is no chance for the
metric to intervene in F = dA. Clearly, a coordinate independent proce-
dure is to be preferred against a coordinate dependent one.

The conventional story then continues as follows: We “semicolonize”
the Maxwell equations in order to make them ﬁt for survival in the curved
pseudo-Riemannian spacetime of GR,

Fij;k + Fjk;i + Fki;j = 0 ,
F ij

;j = Ω0 J i .

(

Fij,k + Fjk,i + Fki,j = 0 .

In the ﬁrst equation the metric tensor drops out, again because of the
symmetry of the Levi-Civita connection:

It is not sensitive to the gravity ﬁeld of the source. The second equation
can be rewritten as

(√

ggi[kgl]jFkl),j = Ω0 √

gJ i = Ω0 ˇJ i .

Hence the gravitational ﬁeld is involved in the inhomogeneous Maxwell
equation only via the metric dependent expression within the parenthesis
and via the determinant of the metric tensor. Incidentally, since for the
Reissner-Nordstr¨om solution the determinant is the same as for a ﬂat mani-
fold, the electromagnetic ﬁeld is not sensitive to the mass of the point
charge.

In our axiomatic approach, see (26), we arrive directly at

dF = 0 ,
d ⋆F = Ω0 J ,

or

dF = 0 ,
dH = J .

(

Consequently, in the Einstein-Maxwell system, the coupling is completely
determined by the constitutive tensor (96). This coupling is referred to
as minimal coupling. Technically, the minimal coupling is provided in
the conventional coordinate dependent textbook approach by the substi-
tution of the partial by the covariant derivatives (taken with respect to the
Levi-Civita connection) and in the axiomatic exterior calculus approach by
Hodge staring the ﬁeld strength F .

Summing up we can state that the minimal coupling between electrody-
namics and gravity is provided by (26) [or (98) with (95)]. The knowledge

Recent developments in premetric electrodynamics

about the Riemannian structure of spacetime is fed into the Hodge star
operator via the metric. In SR a ﬂat metric appears, in GR a curved one.

Nonminimal coupling

If for some reason we believe that the minimal coupling between elec-
trodynamics and gravity is insuﬃcient and has to be generalized, then we
have to modify the action (86) by adding so-called nonminimal terms. Still,
we have to respect diﬀeomorphism and gauge invariance. Riemannian ge-
l and its traces Ricij
ometry is characterized by the curvature tensor Rijk
and R. Terms proportional to the electromagnetic potential are forbidden
because of gauge invariance. The term linear in F vanishes as a product of
a symmetric and an antisymmetric tensors. Consequently the lowest order
nonminimal Lagrangian reads

L(F, R) = α1FijF klRij

kl + α2FikF jkRici

j + α3FijF ijR .

(99)

Let us recall several arguments in favor of a such non-minimal couplings:

were derived in the one-loop approximation of quantum electrodynamics
(QED) [67, 68]. Here e is the elementary charge, h = 2π~ Planck’s constant,
and λc = ~/(mc) the Compton wavelength of the electron.

(iii) The Lagrangian (99) was used as a basis for models with a variable
speed of light [69, 70, 71]. Such an eﬀect is present in all models, except
for the cases α1 = α2 = 0.

The constitutive tensor corresponding to the Lagrangian L(F, g)+L(F, R)

depends on the metric and the curvature tensor and its contractions:

12.2 Maxwell’s ﬁeld coupled to Einstein-Cartan gravity

k. In exterior
volved. In holonomic coordinates, it is deﬁned by Tij
calculus, we have the 2-form T α = Dϑα = Tij
dxj/2, with the exte-
rior covariant derivative D. Accordingly, a possible interaction of torsion
with the electromagnetic ﬁeld is of special interest [73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78,
18, 19, 20].

α dxi

The minimal way of coupling the electromagnetic ﬁeld with Einstein-
Cartan gravity works the same way as with Einstein gravity. Since neither
the exterior derivative d nor the Hodge star ⋆ can feel torsion directly, we
have again the minimal equations (26):

∧

d ⋆F = Ω0 J ,

dF = 0 .

(103)

They will do the job.

The conventional coordinate dependent textbook approach led to nu-
merous misunderstandings. If one applies the semicolon rule to the special
relativistic formula Fij = Aj,i

This expression is diﬀeomorphism invariant. However, it is not gauge in-
Ai + ∂iφ. Consequently, it has to be rejected. As we
variant under Ai
saw in the last paragraph, the axiomatic exterior calculus approach leaves
the deﬁnition F = dA intact, and there is no need, nor is it allowed, to
entertain in covariant derivatives in this context.

Accordingly, the free Maxwell Lagrangian is added to the gravitational
Lagrangian with the unchanged ﬁeld strength. Nevertheless, in an exact
solution of a gravity-Maxwell system, the torsion may depend on the elec-
trical charge, as is exempliﬁed by the Reissner-Nordstr¨om solution with
torsion in the framework of a Poincar´e gauge theory [79]. In other words,
torsion is inﬂuenced by the electric charge indirectly via the ﬁeld equa-
tions. What in the Lagrangian looks like “no interaction at all,” still yields
an eﬀective “minimal” interaction.
Nonminimal coupling

We are now looking for a complete family of nonminimally coupled
Maxwell-torsion Lagrangians that are diﬀeomorphism and gauge invariant.
Because of gauge invariance, the potential Ai must not appear in the action.
Moreover, all expressions have to contain an even number of indices in order,
if contracted, to yield a scalar. The expressions linear in the ﬁeld strength

are of the form
. Although such terms yield a family of
diﬀeomorphism and gauge invariant Lagrangians, they have to be rejected
from a physical point of view. Indeed, on the level of the ﬁeld equation,
the Lagrangians linear in F admit the existence of a global electromagnetic
ﬁeld even without charges. Such a modiﬁcation of classical electrodynamics
seems to be unwarranted.

χijkl(g, T ), guarantee the uniqueness of the light cone [2]. Thus birefrin-
gence does not emerges in this group of models either.

(iii) For the Lagrangians from the third group (107), birefringence is a

generic property. This was shown for (109) in the case of spherically sym-
metric torsion [18, 20].
Axion ﬁeld induced by torsion. The axion, that is, a pseudo-scalar
ﬁeld, was extensively studied in diﬀerent contexts of ﬁeld theory. Its quan-
tized version is believed to provide a solution to the strong CP problem
of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The emergence of axions is a gen-
eral phenomenon in superstring theory. The axion as a classical ﬁeld also
appears in various discussions of the equivalence principle in gravitational
physics and in inﬂationary models. In the context discussed in this paper,
the axion ﬁeld is introduced in (41) with (35)2 as one irreducible piece of
the electromagnetic constitutive tensor of spacetime. According to (111),
we may imagine that in the present case the axion ﬁeld is induced by the
nonminimal coupling of the Maxwell ﬁeld to the torsion of spacetime. Ex-
plicitly, we ﬁnd the following:

(i) The Lagrangians (105) yield

ˇχijkl(g, T ) = ℓ2g[ikgjl](T

T ) = 0 .

(ii) The Lagrangians (106) yield

ˇχijkl(g, T ) = ℓ2g[jl(T

where α1, α2 are free dimensionless parameters, which are linear combina-

(118) by putting α1 = 1, α2 = 0.

If in vacuum an axion ﬁeld α emerges, then the Lagrangian picks up
an additional piece
F , see [2]. Accordingly, the Maxwell equations
are those displayed in (67). Only a non-constant axion ﬁeld contributes.
The coupling of the Maxwell ﬁeld to a non-constant axion ﬁeld, in the case
of a plane electromagnetic wave, amounts to a rotation of the polarization
vector of the wave, see [80], i.e., the axion ﬁeld induces an optical activity.

As in Einstein and Einstein-Cartan gravity, the minimal coupling remains
untouched, that is, we have again λ0 d ⋆F = J, dF = 0.

13 Discussion

Although Maxwell’s electrodynamics is a ﬁrmly established classical ﬁeld
theory, it is still open to new developments along many lines. Furthermore,
the study of the fundamental structures of Maxwell’s theory can serve as
a natural starting point for non-abelian modiﬁcations with applications in
In particular, modern string and brane
high-energy physics and gravity.
theories rely heavily on classical ﬁeld-theoretic structures.
In addition,
there are important classical problems still awaiting for their solutions,
such as the quantization of the electric charge, the existence of magnetic
monopoles, and the value of the coupling constant, as well as a number of
new open issues: (i) The physical place and the role of the premetric part-
ners of the standard electromagnetic ﬁeld, such as the axion, the skewon,
and the dilaton ﬁelds. (ii) The appropriate form of the coupling between
the electromagnetic and the gravitational ﬁeld (also taking into account
the possible gauge-theoretic extensions of standard GR, such as Poincar´e
gravity and, more generally, metric-aﬃne gravity). (iii) The description of
a high-energy electromagnetic ﬁeld in a material medium.

In this lecture we gave an overview of the recent developments of the
axiomatic premetric approach based on the conservation of electric charge
and of magnetic ﬂux as well as on some additional inputs such as the struc-
ture of the energy-momentum. These facts are well established theoretically
and tested experimentally. The ﬁeld variables and the corresponding ﬁeld
equations are then straightforwardly derivable from the basic axioms when
certain natural restrictions on the topology of spacetime are assumed. The
resulting construction is actually a topological one, in the sense that it does
not depend on a speciﬁc geometry of the underlying spacetime manifold.
Only the additional notion of a constitutive relation brings in the infor-
mation on the speciﬁc structure of the geometry of spacetime. The open
problems, indicated above, are directly linked to the investigation of the
properties of the constitutive relation. Going beyond the linear and local
constitutive law is, in fact, a step which takes into account the quantum
nature of the actual matter sources. The corresponding dynamics of the

30

the earlier nonlinear electrodynamical models can be found in [36]; speciﬁc
results on the birefringence in such theories were obtained in [37].

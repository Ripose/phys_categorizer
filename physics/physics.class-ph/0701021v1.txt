Multipole structure and coordinate systems

(Dated: January 2, 2007)

Multipole expansions depend on the coordinate system, so that coeﬃcients of multipole moments
can be set equal to zero by an appropriate choice of coordinates. Therefore, it is meaningless to
say that a physical system has a nonvanishing quadrupole moment, say, without specifying which
coordinate system is used. (Except if this moment is the lowest non-vanishing one.) This result
is demonstrated for the case of two equal like electric charges. Speciﬁcally, an adapted coordinate
system in which the potential is given by a monopole term only is explicitly found, the coeﬃcients
of all higher multipoles vanish identically.
It is suggested that this result can be generalized to
other potential problems, by making equal coordinate surfaces coincide with the potential problem’s
equipotential surfaces.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Multipole expansions are a standard mathematical tool in both physics research and teaching (e.g., Ref.9). For
example, students of electromagnetism often calculate the electrostatic potential of a point electric charge when the
coordinate system is not centered on the latter3,10. In mathematical methods courses this problem often motivates,
and serves as a means to the introduction of Legendre functions through its generating function

g(t, x) := (1 − 2xt + t2)

Pn(x) tn

(The alternative approach to the introduction of the Legendre functions is through the angular equation obtained from
the separation of variables of the Poisson equation in spherical symmetry4,6,11,12.) As the generating function is equal
to the inverse distance between two points (in three-dimensional Euclidean space)—i.e., 1/|x − x′| = g(r′/r, cos θ),
where x,x′ are the two points—one can readily superpose solutions to obtain the ﬁeld of an arbitrary distribution of
point charges. Here, r, r′ are their corresponding distances from the origin (so that r′ < r) and θ is the angle between
the vectors x and x′8. The electrostatic potential then is expressed as an inﬁnite sum over Legendre functions (see,
e.g.,6), with all multipoles present (both even and odd).

The next problem in a typical mathematical methods course may often be to calculate the potential of a pair of
charges, either of opposite signs (“electric dipole”) or of the same sign. In either case, half of the coeﬃcients in the
series vanish, and one ends up with a series over all odd or even terms, respectively. Speciﬁcally, in the latter case
(two equal charges q), the potential is

where r>(r<) is the greater (smaller) of the evaluation point and the location of the charge from the center of the
coordinate system.
(We assume here, without loss of generality, that the charges are on the z-axis, so that the
potential is azimuthal.) Notably, the potential includes a monopole term, a quadrupole term, a hexadecapole term,
and so on. The diﬀerent multipoles are used here describe the moments of a given charge distribution. Speciﬁcally,
the quadrupole moment equals 2qr2
>. When r> ≫ r<, the potential approximately equals the total charge divided
by the distance to the evaluation point, which is the known result for a point particle at the origin of the coordinate
system.
Indeed, under this condition the separation of the charge from the origin is very small (compared with
the distance to the evaluation point), so that the potential is indeed expected to be just such. However, when this
condition is not satisﬁed, or indeed at ﬁnite distances, we ﬁnd that the potential needs to be corrected, the correction
terms being the multipole moments.

Mathematical methods texts often discuss next how to arrange the charge distribution so that one, or more, of
the multipole moments vanishes (in a given coordinate system)2. As the electrostatic problem is linear, one may
superpose charges so that the lowest non-vanishing multipole moment may be as desired, e.g., one may obtain an
electric dipole by having a charge q at z = a and a charge −q at z = −a thus canceling the monopole term, and the
lowest non-vanishing moment is the dipole. An interesting point that is usually not highlighted is that the multipole
expansion itself is coordinate dependent, so that for a given charge distribution one can choose adapted coordinated in

which certain multipole moments vanish. Speciﬁcally, we will show here in detail how, for the aforementioned example
of two equal, like, static electric charges, one can ﬁnd an adapted coordinate system in which all the multipoles above
the monopole vanish. In such a coordinate system the potential is a function of one coordinate only, as the potential
includes only a monopole term, which highlights the simplicity and elegance of the presentation. We see then that
the complex multipole structure of the potential (1) is a consequence of the choice of coordinates. We can ﬁnd a
coordinate system in which the potential equals the total charge divided by a coordinate that plays, in some loose
sense, the role of “eﬀective distance.” It is only the lowest non-vanishing moment that cannot be nulliﬁed by a
coordinate transformation.

The price to pay for this simplicity and elegance is in the form of a non-trivial coordinate transformation from,
say, cartesian coordinates to the adapted ones, and in topologically non-trivial coordinates. Arguably (and only
semi-seriously), there is “conservation of complexity,” which one cannot escape. However, several useful tools of
mathematical physics are used in order to ﬁnd this adapted coordinate system, which makes it an interesting problem,
in addition to leading to deeper understanding of multipole expansions and their meaning.

II. THE TWO–DISTANCE COORDINATES

Let us ﬁrst introduce a convenient coordinate system, from which we can transform to the desired adapted coor-
dinates. Our strategy is to look for a coordinate system that is adapted to the potential in space. As the potential
depends only on the distances to the two charges, a good starting point would be to base a coordinate system on
the two distances from the two charges, so that equal coordinate surfaces would be spheres centered on either charge.
The intersection of two such spheres spans a circle, and an azimuthal coordinate can then uniquely specify a point in
space. To construct this coordinate system, position the charges along the x-axis, say, at x = ±a. Deﬁne the distance
of the evaluation point of the ﬁeld from the two centers:

These would be two coordinates, and the third one is deﬁned by a rotation about the x-axis, namely,

p

L :=

(x + a)2 + y2 + z2

R :=

(x − a)2 + y2 + z2 .

The coordinate transformation from the cartesian coordinates x, y, z to the coordinates L, R, Φ is a regular coordinate
transformation, as is evident from the explicit expressions for the inverse transformation:

The coordinates R, L, Φ are the Two–Distance Coordinates, or 3D–TDC. We will ﬁnd these coordinates to be a
convenient starting point in our search for the adapted coordinate system, although they are unadapted to the
potential problem themselves. The (spatial) metric in the 3D–TDC is given by

The metric (7) is evidently non-diagonal, as it includes the “cross term” proportional to dL dR. Non-diagonal metrics
are of much importance in physics and mathematical physics. Nevertheless, typical mathematical method courses
do not discuss them. This metric is singular at the origin (half way between the two charges)—as can be seen from
the vanishing of Q2 there—but as this is ﬂat Euclidean space, this singularity is a coordinate singularity. Figure 1
displays the 3D–TDC system.

point is at p. The coordinates L and R are deﬁned by the distance of p from the two centers. The third coordinate Φ is
obtained by rotation about the x-axis.

III. SEARCHING FOR THE ADAPTED COORDINATES

To search eﬀectively for the adapted coordinate system, let us revisit regular spherical coordinates, and see why
they are so eﬀective in the description of the electric ﬁeld of a single point charge. The main feature of the electric
potential of a point charge is that equipotential surfaces are concentric spheres. The latter are the loci of all equidistant
points from the center. These two statements imply that anywhere on an equipotential surface the value of one of
the coordinates (the radial coordinate) is constant. To ﬁnd the potential at some evaluation point, we only need to
know on which equipotential surface it lies. For this reason, the potential is a function of only one coordinate, because
only one coordiante is required to identify an equipotential surface. After the radial coordinate is chosen, one can
readily ﬁnd the other coordinates: the polar coordinate θ is found by requiring that it is everywhere orthogonal to
constant-r surfaces, and the azimuthal coordinate is obtained by rotation of the r − θ plane. Spherical coordinates
are therefore adapted to the potential problem of a single charge at their center, and the potential is described in full
by a monopole term only. We show this derivation in detail in Appendix A.

In searching for the adapted coordinates we follow a similar path: First, deﬁne the coordinate χ so that equal-χ
surfaces are also equipotential surfaces of the static 3D Coulomb problem. Because of the problem’s linearity, we
may superpose solutions of two single-charge problems, for which the potentials (of unit charges) are 1/L and 1/R,
respectively, i.e., the total potential is 1/L + 1/R. In fact, any monotonic function of 1/L + 1/R is a good choice for
this coordinate, i.e., χ = χ(1/L + 1/R). Speciﬁcally, we choose χ so that at great distances (L, R ≫ a), the coordinate
χ behaves like the radial coordinate r, because in this limit the potential is almost that of a point particle (of charge
2q). That is, we choose

Notice that the coordinate χ is non-trivial: it undergoes a topology change at the critical surface χ = a. For χ < a
equal-χ surfaces are doubly connected, and for χ > a they are singly connected. Figure 2 shows the equal-χ surfaces.
To ﬁnd the coordinate Θ we require that it is everywhere orthogonal to equal-χ surfaces (which are also the
equipotential surfaces). Namely, equal-Θ lines will be the electric ﬁeld lines. The condition that two curves are
orthogonal is that their gradients are. The reason why we need to require the condition of the gradients is that inner

product is a map from two vectors to a scalar. Orthogonality of two vectors is deﬁned by the requirement that their
inner product vanishes. The way to create a vector from a scalar is by calculating its gradient. Speciﬁcally, Θ satisﬁes

The most straighforward way to try and solve the partial diﬀerential equation for Θ (recall that χ is known; the
unknown in Eq. (11) is Θ) is to try and solve Eq. (12) in cartesian coordinates. This turns out to be a highly non-
trivial thing to do. In Appendix B we discuss this equation. The easier way to solve Eq. (11) is by realizing that it is
a scalar equation, so that we can express the terms on either hand side in whatever coordinates we ﬁnd convenient,
and the equation will retain its form. Equation (11) becomes particularly simple when expressed in 3D–TDC. The
reason why this could be expected is that space is symmetrical under the exchange of the two centers. It is therefore
reasonable to expect that geometrical expressions would be simpler when expressed in terms of the distances to the
two centers (and not other points such as the origin of the cartesian grid), the only “natural” quantities that the
metric structure of space depends on.

We can express Eq. (11) in 3D–TDC in two way: ﬁrst, we can transform Eq. (12) or we can use the metric (7) to

write gijχ,iΘ,j = 0, a comma denoting partial derivative. Either way, we ﬁnd that Eq. (11) transforms to

This solution is easy to verify, or even derive using software such as Maple or Mathematica. Notice that the solution
is any function of a certain combination of L, R, with a acting as a parameter (the only length scale in this problem).
Indeed, any function of this argument is everywhere orthogonal to equal-χ surfaces. To make our solution useful, we
next need to choose judiciously which function. Speciﬁcally, we make our choice by requiring that the asymptotic
properties of the solution for Θ will coincide with the regular polar coordinate θ. This way, our coordinate system
will asymptotically approach regular spherical coordinates as it should, as at great distances the separation of the two
centers becomes negligible.

This guarantees that at very great distances ˜Θ behaves similarly to the regular polar coordinate θ. However, the
coordinate ˜Θ is still not quite what we need, because it is discontinuous: Consider a semicircle at constant large
distance from the center of the cartesian coordinate system (the center is half way between the two charges), starting
on the positive x-axis and going through the upper half-plane to the negative x-axis. The value of ˜Θ will vary from
π/4 to π/2, jump discontinuously to −π/2 crossing the y-axis, and then change to −π/4. Deﬁne then

The coordinate Θ is continuous in the upper half-plane, and it is everywhere orthogonal to χ. It’s range is from 0
to π. Notice that sgn(L − R) ≡ sgn(x) ≡ sgn(π/2 − Θ), and that we only need to deﬁne Θ in the upper half-plane,
because we rotate the coordinates about the x-axis.

We now have the coordinate system (χ, Θ, Φ), which is the Two-Center Bi-Spherical coordinates system (TCBS).

The metric in these coordinates is given by

where L, R are implicit functions of χ, Θ. The metric (17) is manifestly diagonal. Given χ, Θ, one needs to solve the
following quintic to ﬁnd R(χ, Θ) explicitly:

As is well known from Abel’s Impossibility Theorem1, it is impossible to solve a general quintic equation in terms of
radicals. However, solutions in terms of hypergeometric functions7 or Jacobi Theta functions5 are always possible.
Numerical solutions are of course easy to ﬁnd (e.g., using the Newton–Raphson method). Notice, that the Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra guarantees a real solution. It is immediately clear that the coordinate system is singular at the
two centers and at the origin of the cartesian coordinate system. For example, Q2 vanishes at all three singular
points, so that gΘΘ diverges, and gΦΦ vanishes. As space is 3D ﬂat Euclidean space, we know that this singularity is a
coordinate singularity, and not a genuine geometrical one. Notably, the Jacobian of the transformation from cartesian
to 3D–TCBS coordinates is regular.

Given the solution for R(χ, Θ) we can readily ﬁnd L(χ, Θ):

IV. THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM IN THE ADAPTED COORDINATES

To express the potential problem in the newly found TCBS coordinates we ﬁrst express the Laplacian in these

coordinates. In any coordinate system the Laplacian of a scalar ﬁeld Ψ is given by

The coeﬃcients in this expression can readily be calculated explicitly from the above expressions. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd

∇2Ψ = ( ∇χ · ∇χ) Ψ,χχ + ( ∇Θ · ∇Θ) Ψ,ΘΘ + ( ∇Φ · ∇Φ) Ψ,ΦΦ

+ 2( ∇χ · ∇Θ) Ψ,χΘ + 2( ∇χ · ∇Φ) Ψ,χΦ + 2( ∇Θ · ∇Φ) Ψ,ΘΦ

the last three relations resulting from the TCBS coordinates being orthogonal. Notice that Φ is harmonic.

We are now in a position to show that in the 3D–TCBS the solution for the potential problem of two equal like

charges is given by a monopole term only. Speciﬁcally, we show that

This relation can be directly veriﬁed by substitution in Eq. (20): Clearly all the derivatives with respect to either Θ
or Φ vanish, so that Eq. (20) reduces to

the global problem is described by Poisson’s equation, ∇2Ψ = −8πq J −1 δ(χ), where J is the Jacobian determinant
for the transformation from cartesian to 3D–TCBS coordinates. Comparing Poisson’s equation with Eq. (31), we ﬁnd

V. CONCLUSIONS

7

We showed, for the speciﬁc example of two equal like electric charges, how to ﬁnd a coordinate system in which the
electric potential is described by one coordinate, and for which it is given by a monopole term only. The derivation
involved a large number of topics that are covered in mathematical methods courses, such as non-diagonal coordinate
systems, coordinate singularities, quintic equations, multipole expansions, coordinate transformations, and potential
theory. As such, it may serve as an instructive problem for such courses. In particular, it may be used to demonstrate
the deep meaning of a multipole expansion, and its dependence on the choice of coordinates. Speciﬁcally, a multipole
expansion can be made simple when the coordinates used are adapted to the potential problem. The reason why
an inﬁnite number of (even) multipoles are needed to describe the potential of two equal like charges using regular
spherical coordinates (1) is that the equal coordinate surfaces are very diﬀerent from the equipotential surfaces. By
choosing the two surfaces to coincide, we are able to eliminate all the higher moltipoles from the potential, and solve
the potential problem using only the monopole term. The price to pay is in a form of more involved mathematics,
which is however still in the range of the usual preparation of the usual Physics education programs.

APPENDIX A: “DERIVATION” OF SPHERICAL COORDINATES

In this Appendix we apply our method to a point charge, and derive the adapted coordinates, which are just the
regular spherical coordinates. This derivation may serve as a pedagogic illustration of the method, applied to a trivial
situation for which the solution is well known.

As discussed above, for the case of a single point particle, the radial coordinate r describes equipotential surfaces.
We therefore choose the radial coordinate r as one of the adapted coordinates, or χs := r. To ﬁnd the second
coordinate, we require that it is orthogonal to r. Therefore, it satisﬁes Eq.
(11), i.e., ∇χs · ∇Θs = 0 , or, in
cartesian coordinates in the x–y plane, ( ∂r/ ∂x)( ∂Θs/ ∂x) + ( ∂r ∂y)/( ∂Θs ∂y) = 0. Recalling that ∂r/ ∂x = x/r
and ∂r/ ∂y = y/r, this equation becomes x ( ∂Θs/ ∂x) + y ( ∂Θs/ ∂y) = 0 (except for the origin which is a coordinate
singularity), whose solution is Θs = Θs(y/x). Next, we require that at large distances this coordinate coincides with
the regular azimuthal coordinate θ := tan−1(y/x), so that we ﬁnd that everywhere Θs := θ.

Rotating the coordinates by an angle φ about the x-axis yields x′ = x = r cos θ, y′ = y cos φ = r sin θ cos φ, and
z′ = y sin φ = r sin θ sin φ. The regular spherical coordinates are obtained by renaming the cartesian axes x′′ = y′,
y′′ = z′, and z′′ = x′: x = r sin θ cos φ, y = r sin θ sin φ, and z = r cos θ, after dropping the primes for conventionality.

This partial diﬀerential equation is non-trivial to solve symbolically. Standard techniques, e.g., separation of variables,
prove to be ineﬀective. Even PDE solvers such as Maple and Mathematica, using up to 8 gigabytes RAM for a couple
of weeks on a PowerMac G5 were unsuccessful in solving this equation. Indeed, having found the solution (14) using
the 3D–TDC it is evident why straightforward attempts to solve this equation failed. It should be noted, however,

ABSTRACT

The constants of motion of the following systems are deduced: a relativistic particle
with linear dissipation, a no-relativistic particle with a time explicitly depending force, a

no-relativistic particle with a constant force and time depending mass, and a relativistic

particle under a conservative force with position depending mass. The problem of getting
the Hamiltonian for these systems is determined by getting the velocity as an explicit

function of position and generalized linear momentum, and this problem can be solved a

ﬁrst approximation for the ﬁrst above system.

I. Introduction.

The constant of motion of a dynamical system, which has an equivalent interpretation

of the energy of the system, has received attention lately due to the study of dissipative

system [1], due to some problems with the Hamiltonian formalism [2], and due to the
possibility of making a quantum mechanics formulation based on the constant of motion

concept [3]. The constant of motion concept, besides its obvious usefulness in classical me-

chanics, can have great deal of importance in quantum mechanics and statistical physics

for system without well deﬁned Hamiltonian [3]. In particular, when one studies relativis-
tic systems with no-conservative forces or systems with time depending mass or systems

with position depending mass, the concept of constant of motion appears more naturally

than the concept of Hamiltonian. In this paper we analyze four dynamical systems and
ﬁnd their constant of motion. These constants of motion are selected such that when some

interaction is neglected, they are reduced to the usual concept of energy. The Hamilto-

nian associated to the system is deduced whenever is possible to do that. The paper is
organized as follows: we study ﬁrst a relativistic system with linear dissipation and with

a constant external force. For this system, the constant of motion is given in general, and

the Hamiltonian is obtained for weak dissipation only. Then, we study a no-relativistic
system with an external time explicitly depending force, where only the constant of mo-

tion is given. In the same way, we ﬁnd a constant of motion for a no-relativistic system

with a constant force and with a time depending mass. Similarly and ﬁnally, we obtained
the constant of motion of a relativistic system with position depending mass and a force

proportional to this mass.

The motion of a relativistic particle with rest mass ”m” and under a constant force

”f ” and a linear dissipation is described by the equation

(1)

where v is the velocity of the particle, c is the speed of light, and α is the parameter

which characterizes the dissipative linear force. Eq. (1) can be written as the following

Since the expressions (14a) and (14b) represent a no-autonomous system, the possible

associated Hamiltonian can not be a constant of motion, and the expression (7) can not be
used [7] to calculated the Lagrangian of the system, therefore its Hamiltonian. Naively, one
can consider (14a) and (14b) as a Hamiltonian system and to get H = p2/2m
f (t)x/m
as its associated Hamiltonian (p = mv), and L = mv2/2 + f (t)x/m as its associated
Lagrangian. However, this procedure is hardly to justify, and it is not free of ambiguities.

Given the initial condition (xo, vo), this constant is determined, and the trajectories in
the space (x, v) can be traced. On the other hand, for this system, equations (33a) and

(33b), and for the particular case seen above which brings about the constant of motion

(40), the expression (7) can be used, in principle, to obtain the Lagrangian of the system.

However, the integration can not be done in general. Even more, if this Lagrangian is
explicitly known and the generalized linear momentum is calculated, one can not know

v = v(x, p), in general. Thus, the Hamiltonian of the system can not known explicitly.

V. Conclusions.

We have given the constant of motion for several one-dimensional systems. These con-

stants of motion were chosen such that they can have the usual energy expression when

the parameter which characterizes the no-conservative interaction goes to zero. For a
relativistic particle with linear dissipation, its constant of motion was deduced in general,

but its Hamiltonian was explicitly given only for weak dissipation. For a no-relativistic

time depending system, for a no-relativistic time depending mass system under a constant

force, and for a mass position depending system under a constant force, only the constants
of motion were given, outlining the problem of getting their Hamiltonians.

Gaussian Laser Beams via Oblate Spheroidal Waves

1 Problem

Gaussian beams provide the simplest mathematical description of the essential features of a
focused optical beam, by ignoring higher-order eﬀects induced by apertures elsewhere in the
system.

Wavefunctions ψ(x, t) = ψ(x)e−iωt for Gaussian laser beams [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12]
of angular frequency ω are typically deduced in the paraxial approximation, meaning that
in the far zone the functions are accurate only for angles θ with respect to the beam axis
that are at most a few times the characteristic diﬀraction angle

where λ is the wavelength, k = ω/c = 2π/λ is the wave number, c is the speed of light, w0
is the radius of the beam waist, and z0 is the depth of focus, also called the Rayleigh range,
which is related by

Since the angle with respect to the beam axis has unique meaning only up to a value of π/2,
the paraxial approximation implies that θ0 ≪
tion

The question arises whether there are any “exact” solutions to the free-space wave equa-

1, and consequently that z0 ≫

for which the paraxial wavefunctions are a suitable approximation. For monochromatic
waves, it suﬃces to seek “exact” solutions to the Helmholtz wave equation,

This equation is known to be separable in 11 coordinate systems [13, 14], of which oblate
spheroidal coordinates are well matched to the geometry of laser beams, as shown in Fig. 1.
“Exact” solutions to the Helmholtz equation in oblate spheroidal coordinates were devel-
oped in the 1930’s, and are summarized in [15, 16, 17]. These solutions are, however, rather
intricate and were almost forgotten at the time of the invention of the laser in 1960 [18].

This problem does not explore the “exact” solutions, but rather asks you to develop
a systematic set of approximate solutions to the Helmholtz equation in oblate spheroidal
coordinates, which will turn out to be one representation of paraxial Gaussian laser beams.

where the length z0 is the distance from the origin to one of the foci of the ellipses and

oblate spheroidal coordinates are essentially identical to spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) with
the identiﬁcation ζ = r/z0 and ξ = cos θ.

It is clear that the oblate spheroidal wave functions will have the mathematical restriction
that the entire wave crosses the plane z = 0 within an iris of radius z0, the length used in the
deﬁnitions (5)-(7) of the oblate spheroidal coordinates. In eﬀect, the plane z = 0 is perfectly
absorbing except for the iris of radius z0.

q

You will ﬁnd that the length z0 also has the physical signiﬁcance of the Rayleigh range,
which concept is usually associated with longitudinal rather than tranverse behavior of the

waist w0 is small compared to the Rayleigh range, i.e., when w0 ≪
z0, the paraxial wave
functions are not accurate descriptions of waves of extremely short focal length, even though
they will be formally deﬁned for any value of w0.

The wave equation (4) is separable in oblate spheroidal coordinates, with the form

It is helpful to express the wave functions in radial and transverse coordinates that are
scaled by the Rayleigh range z0 and by the diﬀraction angle θ0, respectively. The oblate
spheroidal coordinate ζ already has this desirable property for large values. However, the

The factor e−i(2n+m+1) tan−1 ζ in the wave functions implies a phase shift of (2n+m+1)π/2
between the focal plane and the far ﬁeld, as ﬁrst noticed by Guoy [20] for whom this eﬀect is
named. Even the lowest mode, with m = n = 0, has a Guoy phase shift of π/2. This phase
shift is an essential diﬀerence between a plane wave and a wave that is asymptotically plane
but which has emerged from a focal region. The existence of this phase shift can be deduced
from an elementary argument that applies Faraday’s law to wave propagation through an
aperture [21], as well as by arguments based on the Kirchhoﬀ diﬀraction integral [10] as were
used by Guoy.

It is useful to relate the coordinates σ and ζ to those of a cylindrical coordinate system

The wave functions found above are for a pure frequency ω. In practice one is often inter-

2.2 Electric and Magnetic Fields of Gaussian Beams

The scalar wave functions (47) can be used to generate vector electromagnetic ﬁelds that
satisfy Maxwell’s equations. For this, we use eqs. (13) with a vector potential A whose
Cartesian components are one or more of the functions (47).

If we wish to express the electromagnetic ﬁelds in cylindrical coordinates, then we im-

mediately obtain one family of ﬁelds from the vector potential

Ax = Ay = A⊥ = Aφ = 0,

Az =

The resulting magnetic ﬁeld has no z component, so we may call these transverse magnetic
(TM) waves. If index m = 0 then A has no φ dependence, and the magnetic ﬁeld has no
radial component; the magnetic ﬁeld lines are circles about the z axis.

The lowest-order TM mode, corresponding to indices m = n = 0, has ﬁeld components

ﬁeld is dominantly radial, which component necessarily vanishes along the beam axis. In
the far zone the beam intensity is largest on a cone of half angle θ0 and is very small on the
axis itself; the beam appears to have a hole in the center.
The radial and longitudinal electric ﬁeld of the TM0

The TM Gaussian-Laguerre modes emphasize radial polarization of the electric ﬁeld,
and the TE modes emphasize circular polarization. In many physical applications, linear
polarization is more natural, for which the modes are well-described by Gaussian-Hermite
wave functions [2, 3, 4, 8]. Formal transformations between the Gaussian-Hermite wave
functions and the Gaussian-Laguerre functions have been described in [24].

transformation (52).

We consider the energy, momentum and angular momentum for TM waves in the far
zone, where ζ
r in terms of spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ). Then
the waves are nearly spherical, and so have a phase factor eikr that implies the electric ﬁeld
is related to the magnetic ﬁeld by

In a quantum view, the mode contains N photons per unit volume of energy ¯hω each, so
the classical result (69) implies that each of these photons carries orbital angular momentum

The angular momentum of Gaussian-Laguerre modes has also been discussed in [25], in a

Since kr⊥ ≫

The small azimuthal component causes the lines of energy ﬂow to become spirals, which lie
on cones of constant polar angle θ in the far zone

[1] Paraxial Gaussian laser beams were introduced nearly simultaneously from two diﬀerent
approaches in [2] and [3]. An inﬂuential review article is [4]. Corrections to the paraxial
approximation were ﬁrst organized in a power series in the parameter θ2
0 in [5]. The
understanding that the scalar, paraxial wave function is best thought of as a component
of the vector potential was ﬁrst emphasized in [6], with higher-order approximations
discussed in [7]. A textbook with an extensive discussion of Gaussian beams is [8]. A
recent historical review on the theory and experiment of laser beam modes is [9]. Other
problems on Gaussian laser beams by the author include [10], [11] and [12].

[18] Secs. 8.2.1 and 8.2.1 of [16] discuss the angular and radial functions for oblate spheroidal
waves in the limit of large z0 (= ic in [16]). Results closely related to our eq. (24) are
obtained for the asymptotic behavior of the angular functions, but nothing like the
simplicity of our eq. (35) is obtained for the asymptotic radial functions. The work of
Flammer, Stratton, et al. seems to have been little guided by the physical signiﬁcance
of the parameters θ0, w0 and z0 of electromagnetic waves that are strong only near an
axis, and consequently had little direct impact on the later development of approximate
theories of such waves.

Rather, the classic application of spheroidal wave functions was to problems in which
z0 had the physical signiﬁcance of a transverse aperture. The utility of spheroidal wave
functions for problems in which there is no physical aperture, but in which waves have
a narrow waist, was not appreciated in [15, 16]. This oversight extends to works that
emphasize the focal region of optical beams, such as M. Born and E. Wolf, Principles
of Optics, 7th ed. (Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge, 1999), where the assumption that
the beams have closely ﬁlled an aperture not in the focal plane implies non-Gaussian
transverse proﬁles in the focal plane.

The Gaussian beams discussed here can be realized in the laboratory only if the beams
do not ﬁll any apertures in the optical transport. Prior to the invention of the laser,
and the availability of very high power beams, little attention was paid to problems in
which optical apertures were large compared to the beam size. Gaussian beams came
into prominence in considerations of modes in a “cavity” formed by a pair of mirrors, in
which the beam size should be smaller than the transverse size of the mirrors to prevent
leakage beyond the mirror edges during multiple beam passes [3, 4].

nomials M(a, b, z) discussed in sec. 13 of [17], with a =
orthogonality relation (23) is deducible from 22.2.12 of [17], p. 774.

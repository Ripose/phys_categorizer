Abstract

University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106-4030

A mapping between random walk problems and resistor network problems is described

and used to calculate the eﬀective resistance between any two nodes on an inﬁnite two-

dimensional square lattice of unit resistors. The superposition principle is then used to

ﬁnd eﬀective resistances on toroidal and cylindrical square lattices.

1 Introduction

There is an interesting but little-known correspondence between properties in random walk

problems and properties in electric network problems [1]. In this paper we describe this cor-

respondence and show how it can be used to calculate resistances between arbitrary nodes

on an inﬁnite two-dimensional square lattice of unit resistors. While this problem has been

solved elsewhere [2]- [10], the treatment here both shows the value of mapping electric network

1

problems to random walk problems, and puts the answer in a form that can, by use of the

superposition principle, be used to calculate resistances on toroidal and cylindrical grids.

2 Random Walks and Eﬀective Resistances

In this section we demonstrate a number of surprising relationships between resistor networks

and certain random walk problems. A very lucid explanation of the results covered here, as

well as other aspects of this mapping, can be found in [1].

We ﬁrst consider a general ﬁnite connected resistor network (Fig. 1).

If x and y are

connected nodes, let the resistor connecting them have resistance rxy. We now consider a

random walker who goes from site to site, weighing each possible step by its inverse resistance.

To be speciﬁc, if N (x) is the set of all nodes connected to x by a single resistor, then the

probability that a random walker at x will next move to the node y

N (x) is

∈

px

y =

→

, where cx

≡

N (x)

Xy
∈

Now put nodes A and B at voltages 1 and 0, and let current ﬂow through the network, with

no sources at nodes besides A and B. Then Vx, the voltage at an arbitrary point x, can be

interpreted as the probability that the above random walker, starting at x, will get to A before

B. To see this, we ﬁrst note that this probability interpretation clearly works at the boundary

conditions VA = 1 and VB = 0. At other points, y

= A or B, there is no current source, so

from Kirchoﬀ’s laws,

P

yVy is exactly the relationship that we would write down for the proba-

bility Vx that a random walker starting at x would reach A before B. Since both the resistor and

random walk problems have the same boundary conditions and solve the same linear equations,

they have the same unique solution (although, technically, for an inﬁnite lattice the solution is

not unique – see section 3 for more details).

We now calculate the current from A to B:

×

where we have used the random walk mapping, and deﬁned pAB as the probability that a

random walker, starting at A, gets to B before returning to A.

The voltage between A and B is 1, and the current is given by equation 3, so from Ohm’s

law, the eﬀective resistance between A and B is

RAB =

1
cApAB

It will be useful to write this result in a diﬀerent form. For a random walker starting at A,

let ∆AB be the expectation value of the number of vists to A minus the number of vists to B,

after inﬁnitely many steps. If Pn(x) is the probability that after n steps the walker will be at

node x, then

(3)

It is not hard to show from the deﬁnition of ∆AB, that ∆AB = 1/2pAB, and thus

3 Ref f on an Inﬁnite Grid

In this section we show how the random walk mapping can be used to ﬁnd eﬀective resistances

on an inﬁnite two-dimensional grid of unit resistors. This problem has been solved elsewhere [2]–

[10], but we rederive the result here to demonstrate the power of the mapping described above.

We can solve the corresponding random walk problem with a generating function [13]. Let

the random walker start at position (0, 0). After N timesteps she is at position ~xN =

where ˆei is the step at timestep i, and each ˆei is chosen with equal probability from (0, 1),

(0,

1), (1, 0), and (

1, 0). Then the expectation value of eiˆe

(11)

In the last line we have used the mapping in section 2 to turn the random walk quantity

∆∞∞mn into R∞∞mn , the eﬀective resistance between (0, 0) and (m, n). We can get R∞∞mn in closed

form for any (m, n). We ﬁnd R∞∞01 = 1

2 , either by evaluating the integral above, or more simply,

by exploiting the symmetry of the original problem [11, 12]. For m = n we can evaluate the

integral exactly [13, 4, 5], getting R∞∞mm = 2
π

1 . From these values of R∞∞mn , we can

use the recursion relation R∞∞m,n+1 + R∞∞m,n
−

1 + R∞∞m+1,n + R∞∞m
−

1,n = 4R∞∞m,n for (m, n)

= (0, 0)

(easily derivable from equation 11), to get an exact expression for any R∞∞mn . As we will see in

m
i=1

1

−

2i

P

the next section, the above integral form of R∞∞mn is useful for calculating eﬀective resistances

on toroidal grids.

If we wish to be rigorous, we should note that for an inﬁnite resistor network, Kirchoﬀ’s laws

do not have a unique solution. They do however have a unique physical solution, obtainable by

requiring that the total power dissipitated be ﬁnite and that the current ﬂow be the limit of a

sequence of ﬂows contained in ﬁnite subnetworks. A rigorous theory of ﬂows in general inﬁnite

networks can be found in [14, 15], while analyses speciﬁc for the inﬁnite square lattice can be

found in [3, 5].

4 Ref f for a Toroidal Grid

With the solution to the inﬁnite grid, we now turn out attention to the new problem of a

toroidal grid of unit resistors. We let the toroidal grid be M by N , and want to ﬁnd RMN

mn , the

eﬀective resistance between nodes (0, 0) and (m, n).

5

6
First imagine inserting (1

1
MN ) amps at (0, 0), and drawing out

1
MN amps at every other

−

node (Fig. 2). Let SMN

mn be the voltage between (0, 0) and (m, n) in this set-up. The set-up

in which (1

1

MN ) amps is drawn out at (m, n), and 1

MN amps are inserted at all other nodes

−

will, by symmetry, also have voltage SMN

mn between (0, 0) and (m, n). Superimposing these two

solutions, we ﬁnd that if we insert 1 amp at (0, 0), and take out 1 amp at (m, n), we will have

voltage 2SMN

mn between (0, 0) and (m, n), and thus RMN

mn = 2SMN
mn .

Similar reasoning tells us that for an inﬁnite grid, if we insert 1 amp at (0, 0) and let it

escape to inﬁnity, then the voltage diﬀerence between (0, 0) and (m, n) will be R∞∞mn /2 [2].

We can now calculate SMN

mn . Because of the periodicity of the M

N toroidal grid, the

×

voltage drops on the torus when (1

1

MN ) amps are inserted at (0, 0) and 1

MN amps are drawn

−

out at all other nodes, are the same as the voltage drops on the inﬁnite grid when (1

1
MN )

−

amps are inserted at (aM, bN ) for all integers a and b, and 1

MN amps are drawn out at all other

nodes. So instead of having the left and right ends (and the top and bottom) wrap around in

Fig. 2, we have them repeat. We thus deﬁne

6 Conclusions

This mapping may be used on any number of resistor problems or random walk problems. Since

a resistor problem and its equivalent random walk problem are essentially the same Dirichlet

problem, neither framework is inherently simpler. However, certain manipulations may be more

intuitive and physically meaningful in one framework than another. For example, the common

freshman physics problem of calculating eﬀective resistances on a cube of 1Ω resistors is best

approached by exploiting the symmetry of the cube to join points of equal voltage. Eﬀective

resistances on other Platonic solids may be calculated by the same method, or by cleverly

superimposing two easily solvable ﬂows [16]. While the same manipulations are possible in

the equivalent random walk problem, they are not intuitive, and most physicists would ﬁnd it

easiest to solve a random walk problem on an icosohedron by ﬁrst mapping it to the equivalent

resistor problem.

8

On the other hand, for inﬁnite lattices, the direct solution of the resistor network by sep-

aration of variables has no obvious physical meaning; but in the random walk framework the

generating function is both physically meaningful and natural. The various inﬁnite lattices

considered in [10] can be solved by changing the generating function (and some prefactors) in

equation 10. (We note that exact values for eﬀective resistances between any two points of

triangular or honeycomb lattices can be obtained from recursion relations in [17].)

Perhaps the greatest advantage of mapping inﬁnite resistor lattices to random walks is that

many diﬃcult random walk problems have already been solved and their solutions are easily

accessible. Suppose we wish to calculate liml2+m2+n2

Rlmn, the resistance between the origin

→∞

and inﬁnity for a three-dimensional cubic lattice. The resulting integrals are extraordinarily

diﬃcult to evaluate. However, after using the random walk mapping we get

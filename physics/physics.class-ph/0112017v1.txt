The Theory of vacuum and some practical results.
A.V.Rykov
Chief of Seismometry lab. of IPE RAN, Moscow, Russia.

Vacuum, where matter exists is an objective reality of Nature. It has a
structure consists of electrical massless dipoles. This structure is responsible
for gravitation, inertia and propagation of light . The structure can be inﬂu-
enced by the electrical, magnetic forces and by radiation and thas control the
gravitation and inertia.

Void is only void and nothing more. Void cannot have any physical
properties. For example, vacuum has physical parameters, i.e. dielectric and
magnetic penetrability. That’s why vacuum cannot be a void or empty space
of the Universe. Let’s consider the structure vacuum in details. At ﬁrst we’ll
remove a blunder of physics presented by Coulomb’s formula. It lies in the
fact that permittivity of vacuum were put to the denominator of formulas
for electric and magnetic forces. We’l introduce inverse values:

η = 1

µ = 1.0000000028

107[a2kg−1m−1s2]. It is a magnetic constant of
vacuum equal to inverse value of magnetic permeability. ξ = 1
ε = 8.98755179
·
109[a−2m3kg
s−4] is a dielectric constant of vacuum equal to inverse value
of dielectric permittivity. Newton’s and Coulomb’s formulas get an identical
view. Speed of light gets more logical idea c = √ηξ .

Experimental physics presents necessary data for the study of vacuum.
We mean the data on photoeﬀects in vacuum, on nuclei and nucleons [Kar-
jakin N.I. and others, 1964]. Let’s remind the values of gamma-quanta ener-
4mec2).
gies: 1, 137, 1836, 3672 MeV (2mec2, 137
This series of energy gives a valuable information for the physical ideas about
the structure of vacuum and matter [Rykov A.V., 2001].

Gamma-quanta of ν frequency deforms the structure of cosmic vacuum.
Being within the size of re between its elements, gamma-quanta creates a
deformation ∆re . The deformation energy will be eoE∆re , where eo is a
elementary charge, E - is electrical intensity of the structure. Equation of
the energy will be

where h - is a Plank’s constant. Deformation is function of time

∆re = ∆[re sin(2πνt)] = 2πνre∆t cos(2πνt) (2).

hν = eoE∆re (1),

Let’s deﬁne the intensity of electrical ﬁeld, where N is some coeﬃcient of

proportionality:

Let’s put the obtained expressions, amplitude from (2) and intensity from

(3) to (1):

We can assume quite naturally that re/∆t = c - is speed of light. Let’s

ﬁnd an unknown quantity:

N = h

orq

where rq = qξ/η . We have got a well known formula of Plank’s constant:

h = 2πe2

oα−1

qξ/η = 6.6260755(40)

10−34 (6).

·

On this stage we should clear a situation with chose of numerical values
for h or α−1 . All next values are calculated on the base of h. But the α−1 is
in reality more fundamental then h, because the last one is derivative from
eo, α−1, ξ , η - vacuum parameters. The choice made here is based upon this
quite new study of vacuum.

The names for this parameters are not yet known.
To that stage we get the main parameters of the vacuum structure.
Some consequences from the vacuum structure.
1. Dielectric vacuum media has a tied charges. The moving charge gen-
erate a Maxwell’s displacement current j. This current generate magnetic
strength dH = 1

nent to the E for the Electromagnetic wave (light). The vacuum structure
is natural media for light excitation and propagation in space.

deﬁned by parameters of vacuum. Another words - the permitted electron
orbits in atoms are deﬁned by structure of vacuum (the nature of quantum
mechanic).

3. De Brogl’s wave λ = h/mV . Plank’s constant is completely deﬁned
by the parameters of vacuum - formula (6). This leads to the sin-way of a

It is indirect evidence of electrical nature of
gravitation. The vacuum has a very smal superiority one charge respect
to other. Correctly in 21 sign of electron charge. On the law of Faraday
induction a charged media attracts all bodis to each other. Ratio of mass
attraction and vacuum Coulomb repultion in Universe forms Λ - coeﬃcient

7. Acceleration of mass or of gravity force creates a vacuum deformation

and the last one can be calculated by formula:

We are already met this mass at point (6). What does it mean? First of all
this mass can be a smallest ”black hole” with size rx = qγ mx

10−15 m. Secondly we ﬁnd a remarkable coincidence ρmx = 1.60220

- very close to the electron charge. Again we get indirect evidence in behalf
of the represented vacuum paradigm. All values like ρ, eo, mx, α, mP l appears
to be very close tightened each with other.

10. And now there is the most fantastic a practical outcome: as we see
gravitation and inertia forces are connected with a deformation of vacuum
structure. And becourse of this circumstance we can control those forces,
for instance, by electrical intensity. However, to compensate the Earth grav-

[Roschin, Godin, 2000] shows that alternative magnetic intensity H may re-
duce the gravity and inertia vacuum deformations. Strong magnets rotated
up to velocity 550 rpm. After achieving that velocity the rotor was speeding
rotation without any outer power supply (decrease the momentum of iner-
tia). It is needed to add power consumption about 6 KWatt from rotating
magnets to brake the accelerated rotation to keep it steady. The reduction
of the vacuum deformation is possible to estimate by formulas. According to
Maxwell’s we have Ez = l dBx
Bx = vηH , where v

Conclusion.
It is discovered the structure of vacuum - the necessary media for Universe
to live in. The light (EMW), gravity, inertia, atoms of matter etc. may not
to exist without the media -structured vacuum. The structure of vacuum
has many applications in diﬀerent ﬁelds of science.

Abstract—Representing the relativistic physical ﬁelds as sections of the Cliﬀord Bundle (or of the

Spin-Cliﬀord Bundle) of Minkowski spacetime we show that all the relativistic wave equations satisﬁed
by these ﬁelds possess solutions traveling with arbitrary speeds 0
. By giving rigorous
mathematical deﬁnitions of reference frames and of the Principle of Relativity (PR) we prove that
physical realizations of the v > 1 solutions of, e.g., the Maxwell equations imply in a breakdown of
the PR, but in no contradiction at all with known physical facts.

1. INTRODUCTION

v <

In this paper we present methods for constructing solutions with arbitrary speeds
)1 of the main relativistic wave equations of physics, namely the (scalar)
(0
homogeneous wave equation (HWE) and Maxwell, Weyl, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equa-
tions. Several examples are worked in detail.

∞

≤

In Section 2 we show how to represent all ﬁelds mentioned above as sections of
ℓSpin+(1,3)(M ) of Minkowski
the Cliford bundle
C
spacetime [1, 2, 3]. We then show that if the HWE and the Klein-Gordon equation
(KGE) have solutions with arbitrary speeds 0
, it then follows that also
v <
Maxwell, Weyl and Dirac equations have such solutions.

The solutions we are going to exhibit for the relativistic wave equation are families of
undistorted progressive waves (UPWs). By UPW, following Courant and Hilbert [4] we
mean that the waves are distortion-free, i.e. that they are translationally invariant and
thus do not spread, or that they reconstruct their original form after a certain period
of time.

≤

v <

In Section 3 we present 0

UPW solutions of the HWE and of the KGE. The
meaning of the velocity of propagation of a UPW and the concepts of phase and group
velocities are discussed in details. Misconceptions regarding the velocity of propagation
= 1 UPW solutions
of energy of a given wave are clariﬁed. In Section 4 we present v
of Maxwell equations, discussing the remarkable characteristics of these solutions in
= 1
contrast to the v = 1 solutions. One of the principal novelties is that the v

solutions have in general non-null ﬁeld invariants and are not transverse waves. We also
discuss in this section the important problem of the velocity of transport of energy for
the v > 1 UPWs solutions of Maxwell equations.

It must be said that there are experimental data [5, 6] obtained with techniques
developed by Lu and Greenleaf [7, 8] showing the existence of pressure waves moving
with speeds2 v < cs and v > cs which conﬁrm the theoretical predictions, showing in
particular that the energy associated with the pressure waves can travel with speed
vε > cs. In [6] it is discussed the possibility of designing physical devices for launching
in physical space the v

= 1 solutions of Maxwell equations.

If this is indeed possible we must investigate the status of the Principle of Relativity
(PR). This is done in Section 5, where we give a thoughtful and rigorous mathematical
deﬁnition of this principle and its relation with Lorentz invariance. We prove that the
v > 1 solutions of Maxwell equations imply necessarily in a breakdown of the PR,
which is necessary in order to avoid logical contradictions. In Section 6 we present our
conclusions.

2. A UNIFIED THEORY FOR CONSTRUCTION OF UPW SOLUTIONS OF MAXWELL,

DIRAC AND WEYL EQUATIONS

To ﬁx the notations we recall here the main results concerning the theory of Cliﬀord
algebras (and bundles) and their relationship with the Grassmann algebras (and bun-
dles). In particular a self-consistent presentation of the so called spacetime and Pauli
algebras is given. Also the concept of Dirac-Hestenes spinors and their relationship with
the usual Dirac spinors used by physicists is clariﬁed. We introduce moreover the con-
cept of the Cliﬀord bundle of spacetime and the Cliﬀord calculus. As we shall see, this
formalism provides a uniﬁed theory for the construction of UPW subluminal, luminal
and superluminal solutions of Maxwell, Dirac and Weyl equations once we have arbi-
trary speed (0
) solutions of the homogeneous wave equation (HWE) and of
the Klein-Gordon equation KGE. More details on these topics can be found in [1, 2, 3].

We shall need the concepts of inertial reference frames (I), observers and naturally

Let

a timelike vector ﬁeld I
sec T M pointing into the future such that g(I, I) = 1 and
DI = 0. Each integral line of I is called an inertial observer. The coordinate functions
xµ
, µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 of a chart of the maximal atlas of M are said to be a naturally
h
i
adapted coordinate system to I (nacs/I) if I = ∂/∂x0 [11, 12]. Putting I = e0 we can
ﬁnd ei = ∂/∂xi, i = 1, 2, 3 such that g(eµ, eν) = ηµν and the coordinate functions xµ
are the usual Einstein-Lorentz ones and have a precise operational meaning: x0 = ct,8
where t is measured by “ideal clocks” at rest on I and synchronized “`a la Einstein”,
xi, i = 1, 2, 3 are determined with ideal rules [13]. (We use units where c = 1.)

Let eµ ∈

0, 1, 2, 3). e0 determines an IRF. Let γµ
and let γµ = ηµνγν be the reciprocal basis to γµ, i.e., γµ.γν = δµ

sec T M be an orthonormal basis g(eµ, eν) = ηµν and eµ = ∂/∂xµ(µ, ν =

Subluminal and Superluminal Bessel Beams. The solutions of the HWE in cylindrical

to present new subluminal and superluminal solutions of the HWE. In what follows the
cylindrical coordinate functions are denoted by (ρ, θ, z), ρ = (x2 + y2)1/2, x = ρ cos θ,
y = ρ sin θ. We write for Φ:

Φ(t, ρ, θ, z) = f1(ρ)f2(θ)f3(t, z) .

In [19] the Φ<

Jn are called the n-th order non-diﬀracting Bessel beams.11 Bessel beams
are examples of undistorted progressive waves (UPWs). They are “subluminal” waves.
Indeed, the group velocity for each wave is

v< = dω</dk<, 0 < v< < 1 ,

(3.16)

but the phase velocity of the wave is (ω</k<) > 1. That this interpretation is correct
follows from the results of the acoustic experiment described in [5, 6].

It is convenient for what follows to deﬁne the variable η, called the axicon angle [20],

k< = k< cos η , Ω< = k< sin η , 0 < η < π/2 .

We see that Φ>
Kn are also examples of UPWs, each of which has group velocity v> =
dω>/dk> such that 1 < v> <
and phase velocity (ω>/k>) < 1. As in the case of
the spherical Bessel beam (eq.(3.7)) we see again that our interpretation of phase and
group velocities is correct. Indeed, for the superluminal (modiﬁed) Bessel beam there
is no Lorentz frame where the wave is stationary.

The Φ>
K0

beam was discussed by Band [21, 22] in 1988 as an example of superluminal
motion. Band proposed to launch the Φ>
beam in the exterior of a cylinder of radius
K0
r1 on which there is an appropriate superﬁcial charge density. Since K0(Ω>r1) is non
singular, his solution works. In Section 4 we discuss some of Band’s statements.

We are now prepared to present some other very interesting solutions of the HWE,
in particular the so called X-waves, which are superluminal, as proved by the acoustical
experiments described in [5, 6].

The proof is obtained by direct substitution of Φη, ΦK and ΦL in the HWE. Obviously,
the exact solution ΦL is an example of a luminal UPW, because if one “travels” with
the speed c = 1, i.e., with z
t = constant, both the lateral and axial components,
t) will be the same for all time t and distance z. When c1(k, η) in
Φ1(ρ, θ) and Φ2(z
) represent respectively backward and forward propagating waves.
eq.(3.25) is real, (
We recall that Φη(s) and ΦK(s) represent families of UPWs if c1(k<, η) is indepen-
dent of k< and η respectively. These waves travel to inﬁnity at speed c1. Φη(s) is a
generalized function that contains some of the UPWs solutions of the HWE derived

previously. In particular, if T (k<) = δ(k< −
< = ω > 0 is a constant and if
f (s) = es, α0(k<, η) =

The X-waves. We now present a superluminal UPW discovered in 1992 by Lu and
Greenleaf [19] which, as discussed in [5, 20], is physically realizable in an approximate
way in the acoustic case and can be used to generate Hertz potentials for the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld (see Section 4). We take in eq.(3.22):

T (k<) = B(k<)e−a0k< ; A(φ) = ineinφ; f (s) = es

In eq.(3.30) B(k<) is any well behaved complex function of k< and represents a transfer
function of a practical radiator, k< = ω and a0 is a constant, and η is again called the
axicon angle. Equation (3.30) shows that Φ>
Xn is represented by a Laplace transform
of the function B(k<)Jn(k<ρ sin η), and an azimuthal phase term einθ. The name X-
waves for the Φ>
Xn comes from the fact that these waves have an X-like shape in a plane
containing the axis of symmetry of the waves [19, 5, 6].
The Φ>
XBBn waves. This wave is obtained from eq.(3.30) putting B(k<) = a0. It is
called the X-wave produced by an inﬁnite aperture and broad bandwidth. We use in
this case the notation Φ>

superluminal Bessel beam) there is no Lorentz frame where Φ>

that this is the real speed of the wave; phase and group velocity concepts are not
applicable here. Equation (3.34) does not give any dispersion relation. The Φ>
XBBn
waves cannot be produced in practice as they have inﬁnite energy (see Section 3.4), but
a good approximation for them has been realized with ﬁnite aperture radiators [23, 5].
Recall that if in eq.(3.30) we put B(k<)e−a0k< = A(k<) and if we take into account
that for each component Bessel beam in the packet the following dispersion relation
holds:

Returning to eq.(3.42) we see that the δ-functions make any function of the Fourier

The projection of this line in the (ω, kz) plane is a straight line of slope
1 ending at
the point (β, β). When β = 0 we must have Ω = 0, and in this case the line is ω = kz
and Φ(t, ~x) is simply a superposition of plane waves, each one having frequency ω and
traveling with speed c = 1 in the positive z direction.

Luminal UPWs solutions can be easily constructed by the ZM, but will not be dis-
cussed here. Instead, we now show how to use ZM to construct subluminal and super-
luminal solutions of the HWE.

is a subluminal Bessel beam, a solution of the HWE moving in the positive z direction.
Moreover, a comparison of eq.(3.53) with eq.(3.30) shows that (3.53) is a particular
superluminal X-wave, with B(k<) = e−a0k< . In fact it is the Φ>

eq.(3.57) moves with superluminal speed (1/cos η) in the positive or negative z-direction
depending on the sign of cos η, denoted sgn(cos η).

In both examples studied above we see that the projection of the supporting line of
eq.(3.47) in the (ω, kz) plane is the straight line kz/ω = cos η, and cos η is its reciprocal
slope. This line is inside the “light cone” in the (ω, kz) plane.

Third Example: Consider two arbitrary lines with the same reciprocal slope that we
denote by v > 1, both running between the lines ω =
kz in the upper half plane ω > 0
and each cutting the ω-axis at diﬀerent values β1 and β2.

The two lines are projections of members of a family of HWE solution lines and each

one can be represented as a portion of the straight lines (between the lines ω =

kz = v(ω

It is clear that on the solution line of the HWE, Ω takes values from zero up to a

maximum value that depends on v and β and then back to zero.

We see also that the maximum value of Ω, given by βv/√v2

1, on any HWE
solution line occurs for those values of ω and kz where the corresponding projection
lines cut the line ω = vkz. It is clear that there are two points on any HWE solution

recall that all UPWs discussed above can be indexed by at least one parameter that
here we call α. Then, calling Φα(t, ~x) the real or imaginary parts of a given UPW
solution we may form “packets” of these solutions as

Φ(t, ~x) =

dα F (α)Φα(t, ~x)

(3.79)

Z

We now may test for a given solution Φα and for weighting function F (α) if the
integral in eq.(3.78) is convergent. We can explicitly show that for some (but not all) of
the solutions showed above (subluminal, luminal and superluminal) that for weighting
functions satisfying certain integrability conditions the energy ε results ﬁnite.

On UPW solutions of relativistic wave equations

It is particularly important in this context to quote that the ﬁnite aperture approxi-
mations for all UPWs discussed in this paper have, of course, ﬁnite energy. For the case
in which Φ given by eq.(3.79) is used to generate solutions for, e.g., Maxwell of Dirac
ﬁelds, the conditions for the energy of these ﬁelds to be ﬁnite will in general be diﬀerent
from the condition that gives for Φ a ﬁnite energy. This problem will be discussed with
more details in another paper.

To ﬁnish we remark that for a scalar ﬁeld satisfying

We can immediately verify that if the speed of transport of energy is deﬁned as
vε =

that for the X-wave the energy travels with speed cs/ cos η (c∗ = cs). We thus see that
the usual deﬁnitions of magnitudes such as density of energy and momentum and the
velocity of transport of energy demand a careful revision. (See in this context also the
discussion of Section 4.4.)

4. SUBLUMINAL AND SUPERLUMINAL UPW SOLUTIONS OF MAXWELL EQUA-

TIONS (ME)

In this Section we make full use of the Cliﬀord bundle formalism (CBF) summarized in
Section 2, but we translate all the main results into the standard vector formalism used
by physicists. We start by reanalyzing in Section 4.1 the plane wave solutions (PWS)
of ME with the CBF. We clarify some misconceptions and explain the fundamental
role of the duality operator γ5 and the meaning of i = √
1 in standard formulations
of electromagnetic theory. Next, in Section 4.2 we discuss subluminal UPWs solutions
of ME and an unexpected relation between these solutions and the possible existence
of purely electromagnetic particles (PEPs) envisaged by Einstein [29], Poincar´e [30],
Ehrenfest [31] and recently discussed by Waite, Barut and Zeni [32, 33].
In Section
4.3 we discuss the theory of superluminal electromagnetic X-waves (SEXWs). In [5,
6] we present simulations of the motions of the SEXWs and of their ﬁnite aperture
approximations, which can eventually be launched by appropriate physical devices.

as can be easily seen by multiplying both members of eq.(4.4) by F and taking into
account that k

It is interesting to understand the fundamental role of the volume element γ5 (duality
operator) in electromagnetic theory. In particular since eγ5kx = cos kx + γ5 sin kx, we
see that

F = f cos kx + γ5f sin kx.

(4.8)

Writing F = ~E + i ~B, (see eq.(2.72)) with i
~e1, ~e2 constant vectors in the Pauli subalgebra sense, eq.(4.8) becomes

γ5 and choosing f = ~e1 + i~e2, ~e1.~e2 = 0,

This equation is important because it shows that we must take care with the i =

magnetic ﬁelds. The i = √

through eq.(4.9). From eq.(4.4) we can also easily show that ~k. ~E = ~k. ~B = 0, i.e., PWS
of ME are transverse waves.

eq.(4.21). As it is well known, this is a very important equation (called the force free
equation [32]) that appears e.g. in hydrodynamics and in several diﬀerent situations in
plasma physics [35]. The following considerations are more important.

Einstein [29] among others (see [32] for a review) studied the possibility of construct-
ing PEPs. He started from Maxwell equations for a PEP conﬁguration described by an
electromagnetic ﬁeld Fp and a current density Jp, where

and rightly concluded that the condition for existence of PEPs is

∂Fp = Jp

Jp.Fp = 0.

This condition implies in vector notation

ρp ~Ep = 0 , ~p. ~Ep = 0 , ~p ×

~Bp = 0

From eq.(4.25) Einstein concluded that the only possible solution of eq.(4.23) with the
subsidiary condition given by eq.(4.24) is Jp = 0. However, this conclusion is correct, as
pointed in [32, 33], only if J 2
p > 0, i.e., if Jp is a time-like current density. If we suppose
that Jp can be spacelike, i.e., J 2
p < 0, there exists a reference frame where ρp = 0 and
a possible solution of eq.(3.24) is

ρp = 0 , ~Ep. ~Bp = 0 , ~p = KC ~Bp,

(4.26)

where K =
1 is called the chirality of the solution and C is a real constant. In [32, 33]
static solutions of eq.(4.23) and (4.24) are exhibited where ~Ep = 0. In this case we can
verify that ~Bp satisﬁes

and Ω = KC > 0, we immediately realize that

This is an amazing result, since it means that the free Maxwell equations may have
stationary solutions that model PEPs. In such solutions the structure of the ﬁeld F0 is
such that we can write

4.3. The superluminal electromagnetic X-wave (SEXW)

In this Section we present a family of solutions of Maxwell equations called the super-
luminal electromagnetic X-waves FXBBn . A solution dual to FXBBn , called ⋆FXBBn
has been ﬁrst presented by Lu and Greenleaf in an unpublished paper [39]. Later the
solutions FXBBn and others associated with it have been studied in detail [40, 6].

To simplify the matter in what follows we now suppose that the functions ΦXn
[eq.(3.30)] and ΦXBBn [eq.(3.31)] which are superluminal solutions of the scalar wave
ℓ(M )
equation are 0-forms sections of the complexiﬁed Cliﬀord bundle
(see Section 2.6). We rewrite eqs.(3.30) and (3.34) as (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .)

where z is the versor of the z-axis. Also, let ρ, θ be respectively the versors of the ρ

solutions of ME, propagating with speed 1/ cos η in the z-direction. That FXBBn are
UPWs is trivial and that they propagate with speed c1 = 1/ cos η follows because
FXBBn depends only on the combination of variables (z
c1t) and any derivatives of
ΦXBBn will keep the (z

of FXBBn , εXBBn may not be ﬁnite. Nevertheless, as in the case of the acoustic X-
waves, which experiments have shown to travel with v > cs [6], we are quite sure that
a ﬁnite aperture approximation to FXBLn (FAAFXBLn ) can be launched over a large
distance. Indeed in [6] computer simulations for the motion of FAAFXBBn are exhibited
showing that with an antenna of 20 m of diameter a FAAFXBBn centered at a frequency
of 700 GHz propagates with superluminal speed without appreciable distortion up to
100 Km. See also [40]. Obviously in this case the total energy of the FAAFXBLn is
ﬁnite.

We conclude this Section observing that in general both subluminal and superluminal
UPW solutions of ME have non-null ﬁeld invariants and are not transverse waves. In
particular our solutions have a longitudinal component along the z-axis. This result is
important because it shows that, contrary to the speculations of Evans [41], we do not
need an electromagnetic theory with a non zero photon-mass, i.e., with F satisfying
Proca’s equation (as proposed also by de Broglie [42]) in order to have an electro-
magnetic wave with a longitudinal component. Since Evans presents evidence [41] of
the existence of longitudinal magnetic ﬁelds in many diﬀerent physical situations, we
conclude that the theoretical and experimental study of subluminal and superluminal
UPW solutions of ME must be continued.

We can ﬁnd in many physics textbooks (e.g. [43]) and in scientiﬁc papers [21, 22] the
following argument. Consider an arbitrary solution of ME in vacuum ∂F = 0. Then if
F = ~E + i ~B (see eq.(2.77)) it follows that the Poynting vector and the energy density
of the ﬁeld are

equations,

vε = 1

(4.49)

and this result gives origin to the “dogma” that free electromagnetic ﬁelds transport
energy at speed vε = c = 1.

However vε ≤

1 is true even for subluminal and superluminal solutions of ME, as the
ones discussed in Sections 4.2 and 4.3. The same is true for the superluminal modiﬁed

no conﬂict between superluminal solutions of ME and Relativity Theory since what
Relativity forbids is the propagation of energy with speed greater than c.

Here we challenge this conclusion. The fact is that as well known ~P is not uniquely
deﬁned. Eq.(4.48) continues to hold true if we substitute ~P
. ~P ′ = 0.
But of course we can easily ﬁnd for subluminal, luminal or superluminal solutions of
Maxwell equations a ~P ′ such that

We arrive at the conclusion that the question of the transport of energy in superluminal
UPWs solutions of ME is an experimental question. For the acoustic superluminal X-
wave solution of the HWE (see [5, 6]) the energy around the peak area ﬂows together
with the wave, i.e., with speed c1 = cs/ cos η while (as we said in Section 3.4) the usual
/u < cs, where ~S
theory predicts for the speed of propagation of sound waves that

is the ﬂux of momentum and u is the energy density (eqs. (3.81) and (3.82)). Since we
can see no possibility of the ﬁeld energy of the superluminal electromagnetic wave to
travel outside the wave we are conﬁdent to state that the velocity of energy transport
of superluminal electromagnetic waves is superluminal.

In view of these results we must investigate whether the

of Relativity. We analyze this question in detail in the next Section.

To end this Section we recall that in Section 2.19 of his book [14] Stratton presents
a discussion of the Poynting vector and energy transfer which essentially agrees with
the view presented above. Indeed he ﬁnished that Section with the words: “By this
standard there is every reason to retain the Poynting-Heaviside viewpoint until a clash
with new experimental evidence shall call for its revision.”

5. SUPERLUMINAL SOLUTIONS OF MAXWELL EQUATIONS AND THE PRINCI-

PLE OF RELATIVITY

In [6] it was shown that it seems possible with present technology to launch in free space
ﬁnite aperture approximations to the superluminal electromagnetic waves (SEXWs).
We show in the following that the physical existence of SEXWs implies a breakdown
of the Principle of Relativity (PR). Since this is a fundamental issue, with implications
for all branches of theoretical physics, we will examine the problem with great care. In
Section 5.1 we give a rigorous mathematical deﬁnition of the PR and in Section 5.2 we
present the proof of the above statement.

In [12] we maintain that a physical theory τ is characterized by:

(i) the theory of a certain “species of structure” in the sense of Boubarki [45];

(5.14)

(5.15)

(ii) its physical interpretation;

(iii) its present meaning and present applications.

We recall that in the mathematical exposition of a given physical theory τ , the pos-
tulates or basic axioms are presented as deﬁnitions. Such deﬁnitions mean that the
physical phenomena described by τ behave in a certain way. Then, the deﬁnitions re-
quire more motivation than the pure mathematical deﬁnitions. We call coordinative
deﬁnitions the physical deﬁnitions, a term introduced by Reichenbach [46]. It is nec-
essary also to make clear that completely convincing and genuine motivations for the
coordinative deﬁnitions cannot be given, since they refer to nature as a whole and to
the physical theory as a whole.

The theoretical approach to physics behind (i), (ii) and (iii) above is then to admit
the mathematical concepts of the “species of structure” deﬁning τ as primitives, and
deﬁne coordinatively the observation entities from them. Reichenbach assumes that
“physical knowledge is characterized by the fact that concepts are not only deﬁned by
other concepts, but are also coordinated to real objects”. However, in our approach,
each physical theory, when characterized as a species of structure, contains some implicit
geometric objects, like some of the reference frame ﬁelds deﬁned above, that cannot in
general be coordinated to real objects. Indeed it would be an absurd to suppose that
all the inﬁnity of IRF that exist in M must have a material support.

We deﬁne a spacetime theory as a theory of a species of structure such that, if Mod
Mod τ contains a substructure called

τ is the class of models of τ , then each Υ
spacetime (ST). More precisely, we have

∈

,

M

Υ = (ST, T1, . . . , Tm}
where ST can be a very general structure [12]. For what follows we suppose that

ST =
(explicit) geometrical objects deﬁned in U
M characterizing the physical ﬁelds and
⊆
particle trajectories that cannot be geometrized in Υ. Here, to be geometrizable means
to be a metric ﬁeld or a connection on M or objects derived from these concepts, as e.g.,
the Riemann tensor or the torsion tensor in more general theories. The reference frame
ﬁelds will be called the implicit geometrical objects of τ , since they are mathematical
objects that do not necessarily correspond to properties of a physical system described
by τ .

for in particular it says to us that even if

eqs.(5.16) with mathematical boundary conditions Bh(U ), it may happen that Bh(U )
cannot be physically realizable in nature. The following statement, denoted P R1, is
usually presented [12] as the Principle of (Special) Relativity in active form:

Now, suppose that F is a superluminal solution of Maxwell equation, in particular
a SEXW as discussed in Section 3. Suppose that F has been produced in the inertial
frame I with
as (nacs/I), with the physical device described in Section 3. F is
then traveling with speed c1 = 1/ cos η in the negative z-direction and being generated
in the plane z = 0, will travel to the future in spacetime, according to the observers in

then the velocity 1-form of F is vF = (c

We then arrive at the conclusion that to assume the validity of P R1 is to assume the
physical possibility of sending to the past waves carrying negative energy. This seems
to the authors an impossible task, and the reason is that there do not exist physically
realizable boundary conditions that permit the observers in I to launch F in spacetime
and such that it travels to its own past.

We now show that there is also a breakdown of P R2, i.e., that it is not true that
all inertial frames are physically equivalent. Suppose we have two inertial frames I and
I ′ as above i.e, I = ∂/∂x0, I ′ = ∂/∂x
0. Suppose that F is a SEXW which can be
launched in I with velocity 1-form as above and suppose F is a SEXW built in I ′ at
the plane z′ = 0 and with velocity 1-form relative to

If F and F are related as above we see that F , which has positive energy and is traveling
to the future according to I ′, can be sent to the past of the observers at rest in the I
frame. Obviously this is impossible and we conclude that F is not a physically realizable
phenomenon in nature. It cannot be realized in I ′ but F can be realized in I. It follows
that P R2 does not hold.

If the set of inertial reference frames are not equivalent then there must exist a

then, if observers in I ′ are equipped with a generator of SEXWs and if they prepare
their apparatus in order to send SEXWs with diﬀerent velocity 1-forms in all possible
directions in spacetime, they will ﬁnd a particular velocity 1-form in a given spacetime
direction in which the device stops working. A simple calculation yields then, for the
observers in I ′, the value of V !

In [47] Recami argued that the Principle of Relativity continues to hold true even
if superluminal phenomena exist in nature. In this theory of tachyons there exists, of
course, a situation completely analogous to the one described above (called the Tolman-
Regge paradox), and according to Recami’s view P R2 is valid because I ′ must interpret
F a being an anti-SEXW carrying positive energy and going into the future according to

On UPW solutions of relativistic wave equations

him. In his theory of tachyons Recami was able to show that the dynamics of tachyons
implies that no detector at rest in I can detect a tachyon (the same would be valid for
a SEXW like F ) sent by I ′ with velocity 1-form given by eq.(5.26). Thus he claimed
that P R2 is true. At ﬁrst sight the argument seems good, but it is at least incomplete.
Indeed, a detector in I does not need to be at rest in I. We can imagine a detector in
periodic motion in I which can absorb the F wave generated by I ′ if this was indeed
possible. It is enough for the detector to have relative to I the speed V of the I ′ frame
in the appropriate direction at the moment of absorption. This simple argument shows
that there is no salvation for P R2 (and for P R1) if superluminal phenomena exist in
nature. Our argumentation is endorsed by Barashenkov and Yur’iev [48].

The attentive reader at this point probably has the following question in his/her
mind: How could the authors start with Minkowski spacetime, with equations carrying
the Lorentz symmetry and yet arrive at the conclusion that P R1 and P R2 do not
can be seen to exist
hold? The reason is that the Lorentzian structure of
directly from the Newtonian spacetime structure as proved in [49].

We ﬁnish calling to the reader’s attention that there are some experiments reported in
the literature which suggest also a breakdown of P R2 for the roto-translational motion
of solid bodies. A discussion and references can be found in [13]. A coherent spacetime
model which can accommodate superluminal phenomena has been recently proposed
by Matolcsi and Rodrigues [50].

6. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we presented a uniﬁed theory showing that the homogeneous wave equa-
tion, the Klein-Gordon equation, Maxwell equations and the Dirac and Weyl equations
have solutions with the form of undistorted progressive waves (UPWs) of arbitrary

The possible existence of superluminal electromagnetic waves implies in a breakdown
of the Principle of Relativity. It is important to recall here that exact Lorentz symmetry
can be preserved in an abstract mathematical level through the ingenious construction
of Santilli’s isominkowskian spaces (see [51-55]). Santilli’s theory is important, e.g. for
situations involving the hadronic medium, where superluminal velocities can occur. We
observe that besides the fundamental theoretical implications, the practical implications
of the existence of UPWs solutions of the main ﬁeld equations of theoretical physics
(and their ﬁnite aperture realizations) are very important. This practical importance
ranges from applications in ultrasound medical imaging to the project of electromag-
netic bullets and new communication devices [56]. Also, we would like to conjecture
that the existence of subluminal and superluminal solutions of the Weyl equation may
be important to solve some of the mysteries associated with neutrinos. Indeed, if neu-
trinos can be produced in subluminal or superluminal modes (see [57, 58] for some
experimental evidence concerning superluminal neutrinos) they can eventually escape
detection on earth after leaving the sun. Moreover, for neutrinos in a subluminal or

superluminal mode it would be possible to deﬁne a kind of “eﬀective mass”. Recently
some cosmological evidences that neutrinos have a non-vanishing mass have been dis-
cussed, e.g., by Primack et al [59]. One such “eﬀective mass” could be responsible for
those cosmological evidences, and in such a way we can still have a left-handed neutrino
since it would satisfy the Weyl equation. We shall discuss more this issue in another
publication.

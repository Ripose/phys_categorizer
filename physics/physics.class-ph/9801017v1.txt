In classical electrodynamics for rotating with variable angular velocity
the exact values of electromagnetic ﬁelds,
charged rigid sphere are found:
the ﬂux of radiating energy and the exact integral equation of rotation in-
cluding the terms of self-rotation. The analysis of this eq. shows that on
one hand, there is no ”runaway” solutions, peculiar to the Lorentz-Dirac eq.
of radiating point particle, on the other hand, there appear new problems,
among them is the nonexistence of solution for some external moments of
force.
1.

In 1998 there will be 60 years since the famous Dirac’s work on relativistic
radiation reaction force in classical electrodynamics had appeared. But the
problems of relativistic radiation force are still discussed in the literature (
see [1-10]). Among these problems are:

(i) can one consider the Lorentz-Dirac equation of motion for radiating
charged point-like particle as the limit R → 0 of usual equation of motion
for extended charged body ( R -is the size of the body)?

(- to our opinion [8] - the answer is negative: there is no analyticity
near the point R = 0, thus one cannot mathematically strictly derive the
Lorentz-Dirac equation)

(ii) while radiating, the system must lose its energy, so has the radiation
reaction force the character of damping force or it can behavior in some cases
as antidamping force? And if there is antidamping, do there exist runaway
solutions of eq. of motion?

( some examples of antidamping one can ﬁnd in [2,9,10])

1

To make a careful study of the problem of radiation reaction one must
search for exact solutions of Maxwell equations for radiating charged systems.
Here we consider one such exactly solvable case - the case of a charged sphere
of radius R, rotating with variable angular velocity ~Ω = ~Ω(t).

2.

Let the densities of charge and current be:

with ~Ω = Ω(t)~ez - i.e. the rotation is the around the z-axis.

(In other words we ﬁxed rigidly at initial moment of time the surface
density of nonrotating rigid sphere to be constant and after this began the
sphere to rotate.)

In Lorentz gauge the eq.

for electromagnetic potentials φ and ~A are
(latin indexes are 0, 1, 2, 3, greek -1, 2, 3, metric has the diagonal form gij =
diag(1, −1, −1, −1)):

Due to the form of current (1), the solution of (2) for ~A we can write as

ρ =

Q
4πR2 δ(r − R)
~j = [~Ω, ~r]ρ

∂p∂pϕ = 4πρ
∂p∂p ~A = 4π~j/c

~A = [~ez, ~er]B(t, r)

where the function B obeys the eq.:

The solution for ϕ (1,2) is obvious:

Thus we have the exact solutions for the electromagnetic ﬁelds ~E =

~H = ~erHr + ~eθHθ

The integration of the energy-momentum balance equation

∂jT ij = 0

over the space volume ( here T ij - the total (matter+ ﬁeld) energy momen-
tum tensor) gives the standard expression for the ﬂux I of radiating energy
through the sphere of radius r:

The integrand in (18) for r ≤ R (10) is proportional to ~eφEφHr, thus the
integration over φ yields for it zero result - internal electromagnetic ﬁeld gives
zero contribution to the equation of rotation.

where Ψ(t) = Ω(t)R/c and η = R/c.

This is nonlinear integro-diﬀerential equation (intergal equation of self-

interaction with retardation). Linearization of eq. (20) for Ψ ≪ 1 yields:

(21)

First terms in R.H.S. of (20-21) describe self-rotation of the sphere.

Thus we see that the self consistent treatment of radiation problem im-
plies the non-point-like description of radiating system which leads inevitably
to intergal equation of retardation (this fact was especially stressed in [11]).

5.

If Mext = 0 then eq.(20-21) are the eq. of self-rotation. Then in linear

approximation eq. (21), rewritten as

This solution describes the damping of the self-rotation (so there is no run-
away solutions).

If Mext 6= 0 then the complete solution of (21) is the sum of the (24)
and of the partial solution of (21). Consequently, to ﬁx arbitrary constant a,
one must use some additional condition, which physical motivation, generally
speaking, is not clear. Partial solution of (21) can be found by the Laplace
transformation of (21), but as the theory of integral equations tells, not for
every Mext this partial solution exists! Thus we face new problem of radiation
reaction.
6.

Following Lorentz-Dirac approach one can try to extract from eq. (21)
the equation of rotation of point particle with radiation reaction. For this
purpose let us introduce the angular momentum of point particle N as N =
N(t) = 2MR2Ω(t)/3 and expand (12) in powers of R, R → 0. So if eq.(21)
takes the form dN (t)
dt ) +
(ﬁnite with R → 0 term, proportional to d2N (t)
dt2 ), then the ﬁrst, inﬁnite term
leads to usual regularization, and the second, ﬁnite term is what one must
take as radiation reaction.
With N eq. (21) is:

From this expansion one can see that there is the inﬁnite term, leading to
regularization, but there are no ﬁnite with R → 0 terms, so there is no
radiation reaction, following Lorentz-Dirac approach.

Here we once more meet with the incompleteness of Lorentz-Dirac scheme

(see also [8]).

7.

We conclude our treatment with the following remarks:
(i) self-consistent consideration of the problem of radiation reaction needs

the non-point-like description of radiating system;

(ii) the non-point-like description does not coincide with Lorentz-Dirac

scheme for inﬁnitesimally small sizes of the body;

(iii) the non-point-like description of radiation reaction inevitably leads

to integral equation of self-interaction;

(iv) integral equation of self-interaction possesses some peculiar features,
thus solving some old problems of radiation reaction we can face new ones.

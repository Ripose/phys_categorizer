We propose a simple experiment that everybody can carry out just while reading this paper. The
only thing we need is a pen or a pencil and a ﬁnger. The dynamics of the falling pen, which is
in touch with the ﬁnger, depends essentially on the initial inclination angle of the long axis of the
pen. We point out two diﬀerent types of trajectories of the falling pen and we investigate initial
conditions for each of them to be realized. We write diﬀerential equations describing the dynamics
of the pen and analyze them both numerically and analytically.

I. SETUP AND EXPERIMENT

the critical angle does not depend upon them.

We would like to show in our paper how sometimes
very usual things taken from our daily live can be formu-
lated into an elegant physical problem. Let us carry out
a simple experiment. We take an ordinary pen by one of
its ends while keeping the other in touch with our ﬁnger
as it is shown schematically in Fig. 1. At ﬁrst, we allow
for a large enough initial angle between the long axis of
the pen and the vertical, say α0 = π/4. We let the pen
fall down. Due to the contact with the ﬁnger, however,
it is not a free fall. While falling down the pen slides
across the ﬁnger and this makes it to rotate. Finally, it
fell on one side from the ﬁnger (for large initial angles, it
is a side where the center of mass of the pen was located
initially). If then we decrease gradually the initial angle
and repeat the experiment again, at a certain angle we
notice that the center of mass of the pen starts to pass
through the point of the ”pen-ﬁnger” contact and the
pen falls down on the other side from the ﬁnger.

The question is: What is the critical value of the ini-
tial inclination angle in the considered setup which does
separate the two diﬀerent types of motion of the pen in
our experiment?

First, let us understand upon what this critical angle,
αcr, could depend? After some trials we can see that it
depends on the initial position of the contact point be-
tween the pen and the ﬁnger. More precisely, being di-
mensionless, the critical angle depends on the ratio of the
initial distance between the center of mass of the pen and
the contact point to its total length, l0/L. Interestingly,
this ratio together with the coeﬃcient of kinetic friction,
µ, between the pen and the ﬁnger, which is also dimen-
sionless, are the only parameters which determine the
critical angle (we will consider a pen and a ﬁnger of zero
thickness which is close to realistic conditions and sim-
pliﬁes essentially the problem). Indeed, it is not diﬃcult
to see that we cannot construct any other dimensionless
parameter in our problem, for example, from the mass of
the pen or the gravitational constant, which means that

We would like to determine the critical angle for all
values of the parameter l0. However, this proves to be
rather a hard task. We will solve it only numerically.
Two limits are of particular interest in this problem that
It is
correspond to the case of l0 = 0 and l0 = L/2.
interesting to test our intuition and to try to guess the
value of the critical angle in these limits. Is it π/2 and 0
respectively or not? We will try to exploit both of these
cases analytically.

FIG. 1: The pen and a ﬁnger are in contact at the point O. We

M, can be written in the general form1:

Then, we ﬁnd from Eq. (2) the normal force:

dP
dt

= F,

dM
dt

= K,

(1)

where F is the total external force applied to the body
and K is the total torque.

There are two independent variables in our problem:
the angle α and the length l, see Fig. 1. However, the
normal force, N, which acts on the pen at the pen-ﬁnger
contact point and which is perpendicular to the pen long
axis will also enter our equations of motion. So we will
need three equations in total to describe the dynamics of
the pen. It is convenient to derive two of these equations
from the angular momentum evolution equation written
with respect to two diﬀerent axes. First, we write this
equation with respect to the axis passing through the
center of mass of the pen perpendicular to the plane of
Fig. 1 (in order to exclude the weight force from consid-
eration):

d
dt

[I0ω(t)] = N (t)l(t),

(2)

where I0 is the proper moment of inertia of the pen, ω(t)
its angular velocity, N (t) the absolute value of the normal
force, l(t) the lever of this force. The dependence on time
for quantities we indicate by the parentheses on the right
with the time variable, t, inside.

Now, we consider the evolution of the angular momen-
tum deﬁned with respect to the axis passing through the
contact point O perpendicular to the plane of Fig. 1 (we
exclude the normal force from the equation in this case):

d
dt

(cid:2)

(ml2(t) + I0)ω(t)

= mg l(t) sin α(t),

(3)

(cid:3)

where m is the mass of the pen, g the gravitational con-
stant.

The last equation we will obtain from the evolution
equation for the total momentum of the pen. For this
purpose we choose the frame of reference which rotates
together with the pen, contact point O being in its origin.
In this frame of reference the center of mass moves along
one of two coordinate axes which coincides with the pen’s
long axis. Since this frame of reference is not inertial we
should take into account the centrifugal force acting on
the pen as well. Finally, we have:

d
dt

[mvl(t)] = ml(t) ω2(t)

mg cos α(t) + Ffr(t),

(4)

−

where vl(t) is the velocity of the center of mass along the
pen’s long axis, Ffr(t) = µN (t) the friction force.

We will now simplify the above equations. First, we

transform Eq. (3) to obtain:

(6)

N (t) =

I0

and insert it in Eq. (4) which takes now the form:

We note that by deﬁnition ω(t) = dα/dt and vl(t) =
dl/dt. Thus, we rewrite Eqs. (5) and (7) and we obtain
the system of two coupled nonlinear second order dif-
ferential equations which describes the evolution of the
angle and the center of mass position in time:

substitutions: t := t
We use a prime instead of d/dt from now on in our for-
mulas in order to make them more compact.

We require that the solution of this system would
satisfy four initial conditions: α(0) = α0, l(0) = l0,
α′(0) = 0, and l′(0) = 0. The last two conditions corre-
spond to the zero initial velocity of the pen.

To ﬁnd a solution of the above system is not a simple
task. One way consists in employing numerical methods.
In the next Section we will show results which gives this
approach. After that we will consider two cases when the
system can be simpliﬁed and investigated analytically.

In Appendix A we give an alternative way of derivation
of the above system of equations speciﬁcally for those vig-
ilant readers who could feel themselves uncertain about
the rotating frame of reference.

III. NUMERICAL SIMULATION

In order to solve numerically the system of Eqs. (8)
and (9) we ﬁrst come back to variables ω and vl and we
rewrite it as a system of four ﬁrst order diﬀerential equa-
tions with four independent variables: α, ω, l and v := vl.
Then, we use the ﬁnite diﬀerence method, namely Euler’s
method, to solve it. For this we divide the time interval
[0, T ] into N small intervals, each of a length ∆t = T /N ,
and substitute, e.g., the derivative dα(t)/dt by the ratio
α(ti)]/∆t, where ti+1 = ti +∆t and α(t0) = α0.

(10)

Surprisingly, this simple numerical scheme turns out
to be stable and works very well. We show in Fig. 2
the results of our calculation for the trajectories of the
pen’s center of mass for three diﬀerent initial positions.
We use the value of the proper moment of inertia for a
homogeneous stick I0 = 1/12. We note a complex be-
havior of the pen when its center of mass passes through
the contact point twice. In two other cases the pen falls
explicitly on diﬀerent sides from the ﬁnger.

In order to determine the critical angle we simulate the
fall of the pen for a given initial length l0. First, we take
the initial angle α0, to be equal to π/4 and calculate the
trajectory of the pen. If the pen fell on the left side from
the ﬁnger (we just look at the position of its center of
mass at a height y = 0.1) we subtract from α0 its half
and repeat the calculation. Otherwise, if the pen fell on
the opposite side, we add to the critical angle the half
of it. We repeat the cycle about ten times increasing or
decreasing the initial angle at each step by a half of an
increment from a previous step. This procedure allows to
achieve a very good precision of the critical angle value
10−3. The above method lies in the
of about 1/210
class of dichotomy methods.

We show in Fig. 3 the calculated critical angle val-
ues for the whole range of the initial length l0. We have
carried out the calculation for three values of the co-
eﬃcient of kinetic friction µ.
In the case of non zero
value of the coeﬃcient we see that αcr is smaller than
π/2 when l0 = 0. This is due to the fact that there is no
arctan µ, when the fric-
sliding for the angles α > π/2
tion is available, which follows from the couple of equa-
tions at equilibrium: mg cos α = µN and mg sin α = N .
Thus, when α > π/2
arctan µ the pen ﬁrst rotates
without sliding, its center of mass falls below the ﬁnger
and then (when α > π/2 + arctan µ) it starts to slide.
In contrast, when α < π/2
arctan µ the pen starts to
−
slide from the very beginning. The numerical result for
l0 = 0, see Fig. 3, agree well with the critical angle value
αcr = π/2

arctan µ.

A peculiar feature of the dependence of αcr on l0 is
its ﬁnite value for l0 = 1/2, i.e. when initially the pen
touches the ﬁnger by its very end. This angle is about
27◦ for µ = 0.

We consider now two cases when the system of equa-
tions (8) and (9), which describes the evolution of the
inclination angle and the center of mass position of the
pen in time, can be substantially simpliﬁed.

We have supposed the derivatives γ′ and l′ to be negligi-
bly small compared to unity as well. The solution of this
system is a combination of trigonometric and hyperbolic
sines and cosines. However, due to the zero initial con-
dition for the velocity the sines drop out of the solution.
Thus, we have

γ(t) = A cos ωt + B cosh ωt,

l(t) = A

We suppose that the critical trajectory corresponds to
the case when l(T ) = 0 and γ(T ) = 0 for a particular
moment T . This could probably contradict the observa-
tion that the center of mass can pass twice through the
contact point (see Fig. 2). However, we can hope that
our assumption is valid at least for the limit γ
1. It
results in B = 0 and the oscillatory solution for γ and l:

≪

γ(t) = γ0 cos ωt and l(t) = l0 cos ωt,

(15)

where γ0 = l0/√I0, which is exactly the condition we
searched for. Finally, the critical angle in the considered
l0/√I0. We trace this depen-
limit equals to αcr = π/2
dence of αcr upon l0 in Fig. 3. The agreement between
our theoretical result and numerical data for angles αcr
close to π/2 is quite remarkable.

B. Small angles

Another limit of interest corresponds to small angles α.
The principal question is whether it is possible to prove
analytically that for l0 = 1/2 the critical angle αcr has a
ﬁnite non-zero value. So, we consider small angles α
1
and l0 close to 1/2 and we rewrite Eqs. (8) and (9) in
this limit as:

not diﬀer much from an exact solution even for l close
to zero. We cannot prove this assumption analytically,
though a numerical simulation of Eq. (16) supports it.
Thus, from the condition of self-consistency for l = 0
we should have α0
1. This means that,
in the case of l0 = 1/2, the angle α is always small if
l2
0/I0 + 1 = 1/2 (we note that this limit is
α0
close to π/6 = 30◦). For these small initial angles the
center of mass of the pen will pass across the contact
point with the ﬁnger. In contrast, for larger initial an-
gles the pen will fall on the side where its center of mass
was located initially. So, the critical angle is in between
and it is larger than zero.

V. SUMMARY

We have proposed a simple experiment, which needs
a pen and a ﬁnger all in all, and we have formulated it
into a mathematical problem. The key question of the
problem is the value of the critical angle which separates
two diﬀerent types of trajectories of the falling pen. Nu-
merical methods allow to solve this problem and to ﬁnd
critical angles for any initial center of mass position l0.
Theoretical analysis of the equations provides us the crit-
ical angle value in the limit of small l0 and allows us to
say that for l0 close to 1/2 the critical angle should have
a ﬁnite non-zero value.

We would like to refer the reader to several problems
which are also about the dynamics of the falling pen,
however, in a totally diﬀerent setup.2,3,4 We have en-
countered them while studying our problem. They are
quite nice!

Size–Dependent Bruggeman Approach for Dielectric–Magnetic
Composite Materials

Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Tom G. Mackay

Abstract Expressions arising from the Bruggeman approach
for the homogenization of dielectric–magnetic composite mate-
rials, without ignoring the sizes of the spherical particles, are
presented. These expressions exhibit the proper limit behavior.
The incorporation of size dependence is directly responsible for
the emergence of dielectric–magnetic coupling in the estimated
relative permittivity and permeability of the homogenized com-
posite material.

1. Introduction

The objective of this communication is to introduce a
size–dependent variant of the celebrated Bruggeman ap-
proach [1, Eq. 32] and thereby couple the dielectric and
magnetic properties of a particulate composite material
(PCM) with isotropic dielectric–magnetic constituent ma-
terials.

Homogenization of PCMs has been a continuing theme
in electromagnetism for about two centuries [2]. The most
popular approaches consider the particles to be vanish-
ingly small, point–like entities [3, 4]. Much of the liter-
ature is devoted to dielectric PCMs [3, 5], with applica-
tion to magnetic PCMs following as a result of electro-
magnetic duality [6, Sec. 4-2.3]. When PCMs with both
dielectric and magnetic properties are considered, no cou-
pling arises between the two types of constitutive proper-
ties if the particles are vanishingly small. It is this coupling
that has gained importance in the last few years, with the
emergence of metamaterials [7].

Investigation of scattering literature quickly reveals
that dielectric–magnetic coupling in PCMs emerges only
when particles are explicitly taken to be of nonzero size
[8, 9, 10], although the particle size must still be elec-
trically small for the concept of homogenization to re-
main valid [2, p. xiii], [11]. To the best of our knowl-
edge, available homogenization formulas for dielectric–

magnetic PCMs that also account for dielectric–magnetic
coupling are applicable only to dilute composites because
they are set up using the Mossotti–Clausius approach (also
called the Lorenz–Lorentz approach and the Maxwell Gar-
nett approach [12]). Use of the Bruggeman approach is
preferred, while maintaining the particle size as nonzero,
for nondilute composites [12].

Accordingly, in Section 2 we apply the Bruggeman
approach to derive size–dependent homogenization for-
mulas for dielectric–magnetic PCMs comprising spher-
ical particles. Sample results are discussed and conclu-
iωt)
sions are drawn therefrom in Section 3. An exp(
time–dependence is implicit, with ω being the angular fre-
quency. The free–space (i.e., vacuum) wavenumber is de-
noted by k0.

2. Theory

Let us consider a particulate composite material with L
constituent materials. The relative permittivity and the rel-
ative permeability of the ℓth constituent material, ℓ
∈
[1, L], are denoted respectively by ǫℓ and µℓ, the radius
of the spherical particles of that material is denoted by Rℓ,
and the volumetric fraction by fℓ. Clearly,

L

Xℓ=1

fℓ = 1 .

(3)

Our task is to estimate ǫHCM and µHCM , which are the
relative permittivity and the relative permeability of the
homogenized composite material (HCM).

According to the Bruggeman approach [4, 10], the fol-

lowing two equations have to be solved:

and αa/b

Here, αa/b
are the polarizability density and
the magnetizability density, respectively, of an electrically
small sphere of material a embedded in material b. In the
limit of the particulate radius tending to zero, expressions
of these two densities are available as follows [13]:

αa/b

e = 3ǫb

h = 3µb

ǫa−ǫb
ǫa+2ǫb
µa−µb

However, when the sphere radius is nonzero, the foregoing
expressions mutate to include both the radius Ra of the

More complicated expressions than (5) can be devised by
using the Lorenz–Mie–Debye formulation for scattering
by a sphere [8], but do not lead to signiﬁcantly different
results for electrically small spheres. In the limit Ra →
0,
expressions (5) reduce to (3) because

lim
Ra→0

τa/b = 0 .

Clearly, the incorporation of particle size–dependence
via (5) in (2) leads to a coupling of the relative permittivi-
ties and the relative permeabilities.

3. Results and Conclusion

In order to investigate the properties of (2), let us simplify
it for a two–constituent composite material: L = 2. Ex-
pressions (2) for the size–dependent Bruggeman approach
then read as follows:

0 = f1

ǫ1−ǫBr

These two coupled equations have to be solved together in
order to obtain the estimates ǫBr and µBr of ǫHCM and
µHCM as functions of k0, f1, R1 and R2.

Equations (8) have to be solved iteratively, and the
Newton–Raphson method is very useful for that purpose
[14, Sec. 6.5.2]. Typically, this method requires an initial
guess, which can be supplied using the Maxwell Garnett
approach [2, 3]. If f1 > f2, then material 1 should be
treated as the host material while material 2 is dispersed
in particulate form; and the size–dependent Maxwell Gar-
nett estimates of ǫHCM and µHCM are then obtained as
follows:

and analogously for ǫMG,2 and µMG,2. The foregoing lim-
its are borne out by the plots of ǫHCM and µHCM versus
f1 presented in Figures 1–3.

Figure 1 presents estimates of the real and imaginary
parts of the relative permittivity and the relative perme-
ability of the HCM when ǫ1 = 1.5, µ1 = 1, ǫ2 = 5 + i0.2,
and µ2 = 2 + i0.1, and the sizes R1 = R2 = 0. Calcu-
lations for the relative permittivity and the relative perme-
ability then decouple from each other.

The analogous plots in Figure 2 were drawn for R1 =
R2 6
= 0. These plots are quite different from those in
the preceding ﬁgure. The imaginary parts of ǫHCM and
µHCM appear to be more affected by the size dependence
than the real parts. Indeed, were both constituent materials
totally nondissipative, the imaginary parts of τa/b–terms
would still give rise to imaginary parts of both ǫHCM and
µHCM [12]. We also conclude from comparing Figures
1 and 2 that dielectric–magnetic coupling proportionally
affects the imaginary parts of the HCM constitutive pa-
rameters more than their real parts.

There is no reason for the particles of both constituent
materials to be of the same size (or have the same dis-
tribution of size, in general). The plots in Figure 3 were
drawn for R2 = 3R1. Clearly from this ﬁgure and Fig-
ure 2, the effect of different particle sizes on dielectric–
magnetic coupling can be substantial.

The permeability contrast between the two constituent
materials chosen for Figures 1–3 is less than the permit-

dence on µHCM is less than on ǫHCM . This implies that
dielectric–magnetic coupling affects the more contrasting
constitutive parameter more.

To conclude, we have here implemented the Bruggeman
approach for the homogenization of dielectric–magnetic
composite materials, without ignoring the sizes of the
spherical particles. These expressions exhibit the proper
limit behavior. The incorporation of size dependence

and permeability of the homogenized composite material.
The size–dependent Bruggeman estimates are compared
with the size–dependent Maxwell Garnet estimates, which
do not necessarily evince the proper limit behavior and are
therefore applicable to dilute composite materials.

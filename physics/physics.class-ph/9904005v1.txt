A phase transition in acoustic propagation in 2D random liquid media

(March 14, 1999)

Acoustic wave propagation in liquid media containing many parallel air-ﬁlled cylinders is con-
sidered. A self-consistent method is used to compute rigorously the propagation, incorporating all
orders of multiple scattering. It is shown that under proper conditions, multiple scattering leads to
a peculiar phase transition in acoustic propagation. When the phase transition occurs, a collective
behavior of the cylinders appears and the acoustic waves are conﬁned in a region of space in the
neighborhood of the transmission source. A novel phase diagram is used to describe such phase
transition.

When propagating through media containing many scatterers, waves will be scattered by each scatterer. The
scattered wave will be again scattered by other scatterers. Such a process will be repeated to establish an inﬁnite
recursive pattern of multiple scattering, eﬀectively causing the scattering characteristics of the scatterers to change.
Multiple scattering of waves is responsible for many fascinating phenomena [1], including modulation of ambient
sound at ocean surfaces [2], acoustic scintillation from turbulent ﬂows [3], white paint, random lasers [4], electrical
resistivity, and photonic band gaps in periodic structures [5]. More interesting, perhaps, under proper conditions
multiple scattering leads to the unusual phenomenon of wave localization, a concept introduced by Anderson [6]
to explain the conductor-insulator transition induced by disorders in electronic systems. That is, the electrical
conductivity can be completely blocked and electrons remain localized in the neighborhood of the initial emission site
due to multiple scattering of electronic waves by a suﬃcient amount of impurities in solids. By analogy, it has been
conjectured that similar localization eﬀect may also exist in the transmission of classical waves in randomly scattering
media.

Considerable eﬀorts have been devoted to propagation of classical waves in random media. Localization eﬀects
have been reported for microwaves in 2D random systems [7], for acoustic waves in underwater structures [8], and
for light [9]. Research also suggests that acoustic localization may be observed in bubbly liquids [10,11]. Despite the
eﬀorts, however, no deeper insight into localization can be found in the literature, as suggested by Rusek et al. [12].
The general cognition is that enhanced backscattering is a precursor to localization and waves are always localized
in 2D random systems. Important questions such as how localization occurs and manifests remain unresolved. It is
also unknown how many types of localization exist. It is believed that localization is a phase transition. However,
how to characterize such a phase transition has not been considered in the literature. A deeper question may concern
whether wave localization corresponds to a symmetry breaking and whether the collective behavior often seen in phase
transitions such as superconductivity exits. This Letter attempts to shed light on these questions.

In this Letter, we present a rigorous study of acoustic propagation in liquid media containing many air-ﬁlled
cylinders. The approach is based upon the self-consistent theory of multiple scattering [13] and has been used
previously to study acoustic localization in bubbly liquid media [11]. Wave propagation is expressed by a set of
coupled equations and is solved rigorously. We report a new phase transition in acoustic localization in 2D random
liquids that not only waves are conﬁned near the transmitting source but an amazing collective phenomenon emerges.
Unlike previous 2D cases, waves are not always localized. An essential component of localization in this case arises
from the natural resonance and the collective behavior of the cylinders.

We consider a 2D acoustic system in the cylindrical coordinates shown in Fig. 1. Assume that N uniform air-
cylinders of radius a are placed randomly in parallel in water perpendicular to the x − y plane, forming a random
cylindrical array. All cylinders are placed within a circle of radius R; the cylinder numerical density is N/(πR2). The
fraction of area occupied by the cylinders per unit area β is N a2/R2; the average distance between nearest neighbours
is therefore (π/β)1/2a. No cylinder is located at the origin, where a line source is placed, and no two cylinders can
occupy the same spot, i. e. hard sphere approximation. Experimentally, the air-cylinders can be any gas enclosure
with a thin insigniﬁcant elastic layer, like the Albunex bubbles used in echocardiography [14]. We investigate the
acoustic propagation in such random liquid media.

A unit acoustic line source, transmitting monochromatic pressure waves, is set at the origin, also perpendicular to
the x − y plane. Due to the large contrast in acoustic impedance between air and water, the air-cylinders are strong
acoustic scatterers. Unlike the spherical bubble case, the absorption caused by thermal exchange and viscosity is
unimportant here and can be ignored [15].

Multiple scattering in such systems can be computed exactly using the well-known self-consistent method [13] and

1

the matrix inversion scheme [11]. In the scheme, the multiple scattering can be solved in terms of the response function
of individual scatterers.

The response function of the single cylinder denoted by Πi is readily computed by the modal-series expansion in
the cylindrical coordinates [16,17]; for the present case, Π1 = Π2 = · · · = ΠN . It is found that strong response from a
single cylinder occurs for ka ranging roughly from 0.0005 to 0.5, and a resonant peak is located at ka around 0.006;
here k is the conventional wavenumber and a is the radius of the cylinders. In this range of ka, to which our attention
is restricted, the radial pulsation of the cylinders, i. e. the monopole mode, dominates the scattering. In this case,
the scattering from any single cylinder is isotropic in the x − y plane.

Consider that the cylinders are located at ~ri (i = 1, 2, ..., N ) in the cylindrical coordinates. The scattered wave ps
from each cylinder, the i-th say, is a linear response to the incident wave composed of the direct incident wave from
the source and all scattered waves from other cylinders.

Similar to the 3D case [11], the scattered wave from the i-th cylinder is therefore

and equals the usual 2D Green’s function for a unit line source, i. e.

Hankel function of the ﬁrst kind. To solve for ps(~ri, ~rj), we set ~r at one of the scatterers. Then Eq. (1) becomes a
set of closed self-consistent equations and can be solved by matrix inversion. Once ps(~ri, ~rj) is determined, the total
wave at any space point is given by

First consider wave transmission through the media as a function of frequency. We plot the ratio |p(~r)|2/|p0(~r)|2 in
the limit |~r| → ∞, giving the far ﬁeld transmitted intensity. A set of numerical computations has been performed for
various area fractions β, numbers N , and dimensionless ka. All parameters are non-dimensionalized. Distances have
units of the unspeciﬁed constant a and functions are dependent only on the dimensionless parameter ka rather than k
and a independently. Figure 2 presents one of the typical results for the transmitted intensity in a given direction as
a function of frequency in terms of ka the air-cylinder distribution shown in Fig. 1. It is shown that the transmission
is signiﬁcantly reduced from ka = 0.006 to ka = 0.02; little energy is transmitted through. Outside this frequency
region, however, there is no signiﬁcant propagation inhibition; transmitted intensity varies around the value one. This
result holds for any directions of transmission, i.e. it is representative of the frequency dependence of the total power
In line with the 3D situation [11], the regime in which the transmission is blocked indicates
escaping to inﬁnity.
acoustic localization and is referred to as the localization regime. When N is increased while keeping β constant, the
transmitted intensity for ka between 0.006 and 0.02 will decrease as exp(−(N/β)1/2/(La/a)), from which the energy
localization length La can be estimated in terms of the cylinder radius a. Note from Fig. 2 that at certain frequencies,
the transmission is enhanced. We also note that the localization does not occur at the resonance peak located at
ka = 0.006.

To further explore the behavior of acoustic localization in such systems, we investigate the response of each individual
cylinder to the incident waves. Upon incidence, each cylinder acts eﬀectively as a secondary source. The scattered
wave can be regarded as the sum of the radiated waves from these secondary sources. From Eq. (1), the contribution
from a given cylinder may be rewritten as

ps(~r, ~ri) = iπAiH (1)

0 (k|~r − ~ri|), (i = 1, 2, ..., N ),

(3)

where the complex coeﬃcient Ai denotes the eﬀective strength of the secondary source and is computed incorpo-
rating all multiple scattering eﬀects. Note that without the scatterers, obviously we will have Ai = Πip0(~ri) =
iπΠiH (1)

0 (k|~ri|).

We express Ai as |Ai| exp(iθi): the modulus Ai represent the strengths, whereas θi refer to the phase of the eﬀective
secondary sources. We assign a unit vector, ~ui, termed the phase vector hereafter, to each phase θi, and represent
these phase vectors by a phase diagram in the x − y plane: The phase vectors are written as ~ui = cos θi~ex + sin θi~ey,
where ~ex and ~ey are unit vectors in the x and y directions respectively; in the phase diagram, the phase vector ~ui

2

is located at the cylinder to which the phase θi is associated. The magnitude of the summation of all phase vectors
normalized by N may be regarded as a phase order parameter.

Setting the phase of the initial driving source to zero, numerical experiments are carried out to study the behavior
of the phase vectors and energy spatial distribution as the incidence frequency varies. We observe an amazing pattern
transition for the phase vectors, with which the wave localization is correlated. The left column of Fig.3 shows the
phase diagram for the phase vectors. The right column shows surface plots of the corresponding secondary source
strength magnitudes |~ri||Ai|2, giving the energy distribution scaled to eliminate geometrical spreading eﬀects. The
same cylinder array as in Fig.1 has been used; three frequencies below, within, and above the localization regime are
chosen according to the results in Fig.2. In this particular case, we have set β = 10−3 and N = 200.

We observe that for frequencies below about ka = 0.006 [18] i. e. for frequencies on the left side of the localization
regime indicated by Fig.2, there is no ordering in the phase vectors ~ui. The phase vectors point to various directions.
The energy distribution is extended in the x−y plane, and no acoustic localization appears. The phase order parameter
is nearly zero. These are illustrated by the case of ka = 0.005 in Fig.3.

As the frequency increases, an ordering in the phase vectors and the energy localization become evident. For
frequencies within the localization regime indicated by Fig.2, all phase vectors point to the same direction, implying
that all cylinders oscillates completely in phase. As indicated by the case with ka = 0.01 in Fig.3, all phase vectors
point to the negative x-direction, exactly out of phase with the transmitting source. The phase order parameter is
approximately one. Such collective behavior allows for eﬃcient cancellation of incoming waves [17]. In this case, the
wave energy is localized near the transmitting source. It decays about exponentially in all directions, setting the
localization length to be around 26a, much smaller than the range enclosing the random cylinder array; for β = 10−3
and N = 200, the range R is around 450a. The localization behavior is independent of the outer boundary and always
surfaces for suﬃciently large β and N . Such a collective phenomenon is a clear indication of a global behavior of the
system and may imply a symmetry breaking and appearance of a kind of Goldstone bosons.

The non-localization at ka = 0.005 is not caused by the ﬁnite sample size, because no indication of energy localization
appears as we increase the sample size. If the wave were localized at this frequency, the localization length would be
shorter than that for ka = 0.01, as the scattering is stronger. The localization would be stronger; this is not observed.
When the frequency increases further, moving outside the localization regime, the in-phase ordering disappears. In
the meantime, the wave becomes extended again. This is shown by the example ka = 0.035 in Fig.3. The magnitude
of the phase order parameter is signiﬁcantly smaller than that obtained for the localized situation.

The following considerations support and elucidate the localization behaviour and phase transition observed. (1)
The localization is not due to dissipation. Acoustic absorption is negligible in the cases considered, and no mechanism
for absorption has been included in our model. (2) By varying the cylinder number N while keeping the area fraction β
constant, it can be shown that the localization or non-localization behavior is qualitatively unchanged, thus not caused
by the boundary of the cylinder arrays. (3) The above localization phenomena are caused by multiple scattering.
When we manually turn oﬀ the multiple scattering from Eq. (1), the localization disappears. (4) The localization
behavior also disappears when the cylinder concentration reaches a suﬃciently low level. The localization range in
Fig.2 is narrowed, tending to vanish. (5) When the wave is not localized, the energy distribution varies as the random
placement of the cylinders changes at a given concentration β. Once localized, the localization behavior will not
change as the cylinder placement varies.

In summary, we have demonstrated a new phase transition in acoustic propagation in 2D random arrays of air-
cylinders in water. When the concentration of the air-cylinders exceeds a certain value, acoustic waves become
localized near the transmitting source within a range of frequencies. The results indicate that the wave localization is
related to the collective behaviour of the air-cylinders in the presence of multiple scattering. Although these properties
may not hold in general, the fact that they do for resonant air-cylinders makes these scatterers ideal for theoretical
and experimental localization studies.

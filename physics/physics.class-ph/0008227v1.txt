1 Problem

Discuss the motion of a (thin) disk of mass m and radius a that rolls without slipping on
a horizontal plane. Consider steady motion in which the center of mass of the disk moves
in a horizontal circle of radius b, the special cases where b = 0 or b → ∞, as well as small
oscillations about steady motion. Discuss the role of friction in various aspects of the motion.

2 Solution

This classic problem has been treated by many authors, perhaps in greatest detail but very
succinctly by Routh in article 244 of [1]. Here, we adopt a vectorial approach as advocated
by Milne [2]. The equations of motion are deduced in sec. 2.1, and steady motion is discussed
in secs. 2.2 and 2.3. Oscillation about steady motion is considered in sec. 2.5, and eﬀects
of friction are discussed in secs. 2.4, 2.6 and 2.7. Section 2.8 presents a brief summary of
the various aspects of the motions discussed in secs. 2.1-7. The issues of non-rigid-body
motion and rolling motion on curved surfaces are mentioned in sec. 2.9, using the science
toy “Euler’s Disk” as an example.

2.1 The Equations of Motion

In addition to the ˆz axis which is vertically upwards, we introduce a right-handed coordinate
triad of unit vectors (ˆ1, ˆ2, ˆ3) related to the geometry of the disk, as shown in Fig. 1. Axis
ˆ1 lies along the symmetry axis of the disk. Axis ˆ3 is directed from the center of the disk to
the point of contact with the horizontal plane, and makes angle α to that plane. The vector
from the center of the disk to the point of contact is then

a = aˆ3.

(1)

Axis ˆ2 = ˆ3 × ˆ1 lies in the plane of the disk, and also in the horizontal plane. The sense
of axis ˆ1 is chosen so that the component ω1 of the angular velocity vector ~ω of the disk
about this axis is positive. Consequently, axis ˆ2 points in the direction of the velocity of the
point of contact. (For the special case where the point of contact does not move, ω1 = 0 and
analysis is unaﬀected by the choice of direction of axis ˆ1.)

1

Figure 1: A disk of radius a rolls without slipping on a horizontal plane. The
symmetry axis of the disk is called axis 1, and makes angle α to the z axis,
which is vertically upwards. The line from the center of the disk to the point of
contact with the plane is called axis 3, which makes angle α to the horizontal,
where 0 ≤ α ≤ π. The horizontal axis 2 is deﬁned by ˆ2 = ˆ3 × ˆ1, and the
horizontal axis r is deﬁned by ˆr = ˆ2 × ˆz. The angular velocity of the disk
about axis 1 is called ω1, and the angular velocity of the axes (ˆ1, ˆ2, ˆ3) about
the vertical is called Ω. The motion of the point of contact is instantaneously
in a circle of radius r. The distance from the axis of this motion to the center
of mass of the disk is labelled b.

Before discussing the dynamics of the problem, a considerable amount can be deduced
from kinematics. The total angular velocity ~ω can be thought of as composed of two parts,

~ω = ~ωaxes + ωrelˆ1,

(2)

where ~ωaxes is the angular velocity of the triad (ˆ1, ˆ2, ˆ3), and ωrelˆ1 is the angular velocity of
the disk relative to the triad; the relative angular velocity can only have a component along
ˆ1 by deﬁnition. The angular velocity of the axes has component ˙α about the horizontal
axis ˆ2 (where the dot indicates diﬀerentiation with respect to time), and is deﬁned to have
component Ω about the vertical axis ˆz. Since axis ˆ2 is always horizontal, ~ωaxes has no
component along the axis ˆ2 × ˆz ≡ ˆr. Hence, the angular velocity of the axes can be written

~ωaxes = Ωˆz + ˙αˆ2 = −Ω cos αˆ1 + ˙αˆ2 − Ω sin αˆ3,

noting that

ˆz = − cos αˆ1 − sin αˆ3,

as can be seen from Fig. 1. The time rates of change of the axes are therefore

dˆ1
dt

= ~ωaxes × ˆ1 = −Ω sin αˆ2 − ˙αˆ3,

= ~ωaxes × ˆ2 = Ω sin αˆ1 − Ω cos αˆ3, = −Ωˆr,

= ~ωaxes × ˆ3 = ˙αˆ1 + Ω cos αˆ2,

where the rotating horizontal axis ˆr is related by

ˆr = ˆ2 × ˆz = − sin αˆ1 + cos αˆ3.

Combining eqs. (2) and (3) we write the total angular velocity as

where

~ω = ω1ˆ1 + ˙αˆ2 − Ω sin αˆ3,

ω1 = −Ω cos α + ωrel.

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

The constraint that the disk rolls without slipping relates the velocity of the center of
mass to the angular velocity vector ~ω of the disk. In particular, the instantaneous velocity
of the point contact of the disk with the horizontal plane is zero,

Hence,

using eqs. (1) and (9).

vcontact = vcm + ~ω × a = 0.

vcm =

drcm
dt

= aˆ3 × ~ω = −a ˙αˆ1 + aω1ˆ2,

(11)

(12)

Another kinematic relation can be deduced by noting that the point of contact between
the disk and the horizontal plane can aways be considered as moving instantaneously in a
circle whose radius vector we deﬁne as r = rˆr with r ≥ 0, as shown in Fig. 1. The horizontal
vector distance from the axis of this instantaneous circular motion to the center of mass of
the disk is labelled b = bˆr, where

(13)
Since axis ˆr (and axis ˆ2) precesses about the vertical with angular velocity Ωˆz, the ˆ2 com-
ponent of the velocity of the center of mass is Ωˆz × bˆr = bΩˆ2. But, according to eq. (12),
this velocity is also aω1ˆ2. Thus,

b = r − a sin α.

ω1 =

Ω.

(14)

b
a

While ω1 is deﬁned to be nonnegative, length b can be negative if Ω is negative as well. We
could use either ω1 or b as one of the basic parameters of the problem. For now, we continue
to use ω1, as we wish to include the special cases of b = 0 and ∞ in the general analysis.

Except for axis ˆ1, the rotating axes are not body axes, but the inertia tensor is diagonal

with respect to them. We write

I11 = 2kma2,

I22 = kma2 = I33,

(15)

which holds for any thin circularly symmetric disc according to the perpendicular axis the-
orem; k = 1/2 for a disk with mass m concentrated at the rim, k = 1/4 for a uniform disk,

3

etc. The angular momentum Lcm of the disk with respect to its center of mass can now be
written as

(16)

Lcm =

~~I · ~ω = kma2(2ω1ˆ1 + ˙αˆ2 − Ω sin αˆ3).

Turning at last to the dynamics of the rolling disk, we suppose that the only forces on it
are −mgˆz due to gravity and F at the point of contact with the horizontal plane. For now,
we ignore rolling friction and friction due to the air surrounding the disk.

The equation of motion for the position rcm of the center of mass of the disk is then

The torque equation of motion for the angular momentum Lcm about the center of mass is

This can be expanded using eqs. (4), (5)-(7), (12) and (16) to yield the ˆ1, ˆ2 and ˆ3 components
of the equation of motion,

cos α,

(20)

(21)

(22)

2.2 Steady Motion

˙α = ¨α = ˙Ω = ˙ω1 = 0, and we deﬁne αsteady = α0, Ωsteady = Ω0
For steady motion,
and ω1,steady = ω10. The equations of motion (20) and (22) are now trivially satisﬁed, and
eq. (21) becomes

kΩ2

0 sin α0 cos α0 + (2k + 1)ω10Ω0 sin α0 =

g
a

cos α0,

(23)

A special case of steady motion is α0 = π/2, corresponding to the plane of the disk being
vertical. In this case, eq. (23) requires that ω10Ω0 = 0. If Ω0 = 0, the disk rolls along a
straight line and ω10 is the rolling angular velocity. If ω10 = 0, the disk spins in place about
the vertical axis with angular velocity Ω0.

For α0 6= π/2, the angular velocity Ω0ˆz of the axes about the vertical must be nonzero.
We can then replace ω10 by the radius b of the horizontal circular motion of the center of
mass using eqs. (13) and (14):

ω10 =

b
a

Ω0 = Ω0(cid:18) r

a

− cos α0(cid:19) .

4

(24)

Inserting this in (23), we ﬁnd

Ω2

0 =

g cot α0

ka cos α0 + (2k + 1)b

=

g cot α0

(2k + 1)r − (k + 1)a cos α0

.

(25)

For π/2 < α0 < π the denominator of eq. (25) is positive, since r is positive by deﬁnition,
but the numerator is negative. Hence, Ω0 is imaginary, and steady motion is not possible in
this quadrant of angle α0.

For 0 < α0 < π/2, Ω0 is real and steady motion is possible so long as

b > −

ak cos α0
2k + 1

.

(26)

In addition to the commonly observed case of b > 0, steady motion is possible with small
negative values of b

A famous special case is when b = 0, and the center of mass of the disk is at rest. Here,

eq. (25) becomes

Ω2

0 =

g

ak sin α0

,

and ω10 = 0 according to eq. (24), so that

ωrel = Ω0 cos α0,

(27)

(28)

recalling eq. (10). Also, the total angular velocity becomes simply ~ω = −Ω0 sin α0ˆ3 according
to eq. (9), so the instantaneous axis of rotation is axis 3 which contains the center of mass
and the point of contact, both of which are instantaneously at rest.

2.3 Shorter Analysis of Steady Motion with b = 0

The analysis of a spinning coin whose center is at rest can be shortened considerably by
noting at the outset that in this case axis 3 is the instantaneous axis of rotation. Then, the
angular velocity is ~ω = ωˆ3, and the angular momentum is simply

L = I33ωˆ3 = kma2ωˆ3.

(29)

Since the center of mass is at rest, the contact force F is just mgˆz, so the torque about the
center of mass is

dL
dt
We see that the equation of motion for L has the form

N = aˆ3 × mgˆz =

.

where

dL
dt

= ~Ω0 × L,

~Ω0 = −

g

akω

ˆz.

Thus, the angular momentum, and the coin, precesses about the vertical at rate Ω0.

5

(30)

(31)

(32)

A second relation between ~ω and ~Ω0 is obtained from eq. (2) by noting that ~ωaxes = ~Ω0,

so that

using eq. (4). Hence,

and

~ω = (−Ω0 cos α0 + ωrel)ˆ1 − Ω0 sin α0ˆ3 = ωˆ3,

ω = −Ω0 sin α0,

ωrel = Ω0 cos α0.

Combining eqs. (32) and (34), we again ﬁnd that

Ω2

0 =

g

ak sin α0

,

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

As α0 approaches zero, the angular velocity of the point of contact becomes very large, and
one hears a high-frequency sound associated with the spinning disk. However, a prominent
aspect of what one sees is the rotation of the ﬁgure on the face of the coin, whose angular
velocity Ω0 −ωrel = Ω0(1−cos α0) approaches zero. The total angular velocity ω also vanishes
as α0 → 0.

2.4 Radial Slippage During “Steady” Motion

The contact force F during steady motion at a small angle α0 is obtained from eqs. (6), (12),
(17), (24) and (27) as

F = mgˆz −

b

ak sin α0

mgˆr.

(37)

The horizontal component of force F is due to static friction at the point of contact. The
coeﬃcient µ of friction must therefore satisfy

µ ≥

|b|

ak sin α0

,

(38)

otherwise the disk will slip in the direction opposite to the radius vector b. Since coeﬃcient
µ is typically one or less, slippage will occur whenever ak sin α0 <∼ |b|. As the disk loses
energy and angle α decreases, the slippage will reduce |b| as well. The trajectory of the
center of the disk will be a kind of inward spiral leading toward b = 0 for small α.

If distance b is negative, it must obey |b| < ak cos α0/(2k + 1) according to eq. (26). In

this case, eq. (38) becomes

µ ≥

cot α0
2k + 1

,

(39)

which could be satisﬁed for a uniform disk only for α0 >∼ π/3. Motion with negative b is
likely to be observed only brieﬂy before large radial slippage when α0 is large reduces b to
zero.

2.5 Small Oscillations about Steady Motion

We now suppose that α, Ω and ω1 undergo oscillations at angular frequency ̟ about their
equilibrium values of the form

α = α0 + ǫ cos ̟t,
Ω = Ω0 + δ cos ̟t,
ω1 = ω10 + γ cos ̟t,

(40)

(41)
(42)

where ǫ, δ and γ are small constants. Inserting these in the equation of motion (22) and
equating terms of ﬁrst order of smallness, we ﬁnd that

δ = −

2ǫ

sin α0

(Ω0 cos α0 + ω10).

(43)

From this as well as from eq. (40), we see that ǫ/ sin α0 ≪ 1 for small oscillations. Similarly,
eq. (20) leads to

γ = −ǫ

Ω0 sin α0
2k + 1

,

(44)

and eq. (21) leads to

ǫ̟2(k + 1) = −(2k + 1)(ǫω10Ω0 cos α0 + γΩ0 sin α0 + δω10 sin α0) + ǫkΩ2

−2δkΩ0 sin α0 cos α0 − ǫ

Combining eqs. (43)-(45), we obtain

which agrees with Routh [1], noting that our k, Ω0, and ω10 are his k2, µ, and n.
For the special case of a wheel rolling in a straight line, α0 = π/2, Ω0 = 0, and

The rolling is stable only if

(46)

(47)

(48)

Another special case is that of a disk spinning about a vertical diameter, for which
α0 = π/2 and ω10 and b are zero. Then, eq. (46) indicates that the spinning is stable only
for

|Ω0| > s g

a(k + 1)

,

(49)

which has been called the condition for “sleeping”. Otherwise, angle α decreases when
perturbed, and the motion of the disc becomes that of the more general case.

7

Returning to the general analysis of eq. (46), we eliminate ω10 using eq. (24) and replace

the term (g/a) sin α0 via eq. (25) to ﬁnd

̟2
Ω2

(k + 1) = 3k cos2 α0 + sin2 α0 +

+ 2

b2
a2 (2k + 1).

(50)

The term in eq. (50) in large parentheses is negative for α0 > tan−1q(6k + 1)/(2k + 1),
which is about 60◦ for a uniform disk. Hence for positive b the motion is unstable for large
α0, and the disk will appear fall over quickly into a rolling motion with α0 <∼ 60◦, after which
α0 will decrease more slowly due to the radial slippage discussed in sec. 2.4, until b becomes
very small. The subsequent motion at small α0 is considered further in sec. 2.6.

The motion with negative b is always stable against small oscillations, but the radial

slippage is large as noted in sec. 2.4.

For motion with b ≪ a, such as for a spinning coin whose center is nearly ﬁxed, the

frequency of small oscillation is given by

For small angles this becomes

̟
Ω0

= s 3k cos2 α0 + sin2 α0

k + 1

.

̟
Ω0

≈ s 3k

k + 1

.

(51)

(52)

For a uniform disk with k = 1/4, the frequency ̟ of small oscillation approaches q3/5Ω0 =

0.77Ω0, while for a hoop with k = 1/2, ̟ → Ω0 as α0 → 0.

The eﬀect of this small oscillation of a spinning coin is to produce a kind of rattling sound
during which the frequency sounds a bit “wrong”. This may be particularly noticeable if a
surface imperfection suddenly excites the oscillation to a somewhat larger amplitude.

The radial slippage of the point of contact discussed in sec. 2.4 will be enhanced by the

rattling, which requires a larger peak frictional force to maintain slop-free motion.

As angle α0 approaches zero, the slippage keeps the radius b of order a sin α0. For small

α0, b ≈ α0a and eq. (50) gives the frequency of small oscillation as

For a uniform disk, k = 1/4, and eq. (53) gives

̟ ≈ Ω0s 3k + (6k + 1)α0

k + 1

.

̟ ≈ Ω0s 3 + 10α0

5

.

(53)

(54)

When α0 ≈ 0.2 rad, the oscillation and rotation frequencies are nearly identical, at which
time a very low frequency beat can be discerned in the nutations of the disk. Once α0
drops below about 0.1 rad, the low-frequency nutation disappears and the disk settles into
a motion in which the center of mass hardly appears to move, and the rotation frequency

Ω0 ≈ qg/akα0 grows very large.

For a hoop (k = 1/2), the low-frequency beat will be prominent for angles α near zero.

8

2.6 Friction at Very Small α

In practice, the motion of a spinning disk appears to cease rather abruptly for a small value
of the angle α, corresponding to large precession angular velocity Ω. If the motion continued,
the velocity Ωa of the point of contact would eventually exceed the speed of sound.

This suggests that air friction may play a role in the motion at very small α, as has been

discussed recently by Moﬀatt [3].

When the rolling motion ceases, the disk seems to ﬂoat for a moment, and then settle
onto the horizontal surface.
It appears that the upward contact force Fz vanished, and
the disk lost contact with the surface. From eqs. (12) and (17), we see that for small α,
Fz ≈ ma¨α − mg. Since the height of the center of mass above the surface is h ≈ aα for
small α, we recognize that the disk loses contact with the surface when the center of mass
is falling with acceleration g.

Moﬀatt invites us to relate the power P dissipated by friction to the rate of change dU/dt

of total energy of the disk. For a disk moving with b = 0 at a small angle α(t),

U =

mag ˙α ≈

5
2

mag ˙α,

where the second approximation holds when Fz ≈ 0 and ma¨α ≈ mg.

(55)

(56)

For the dissipation of energy we need a model. First, we consider rolling friction, taken to
be the eﬀect of inelastic collisions between the disk and the horizontal surface. For example,
suppose the surface features small bumps of average height δ with average spacing ǫδ. We
suppose that the disk dissipates energy mgδ when passing over a bump. The time taken for
the rotating disk to pass over a bump is ǫδ/aΩ, so the rate of dissipation of energy to rolling
friction is

(62)

which exhibits what is called by Moﬀatt a “ﬁnite-time singularity”.

However, the premise of this analysis is that it will cease to hold when ¨α = g/a and the

disk loses contact with the surface. Taking the derivative of eq. (61), this gives

αmin =  2(g/a)(β−1)

25ǫ2kβ !1/(β+1)

.

(65)

For a uniform disk with k = 1/4, and the simplest rolling friction model with β = 1, this
gives αmin = 0.57/ǫ. If the bump-spacing parameter ǫ had a value of 10, then αmin ≈ 3.4◦,
which is roughly as observed.

Moﬀatt [3] ignores rolling friction, but makes a model for viscous drag of the air between

the disc and the surface. He ﬁnds

(66)

(67)

where µ = 1.8 × 10−4 g-cm−1-s is the viscosity of air. This also yields αmin of a few degrees,
and hence a similar value for Ωmax. Formally, the air-drag model is the same as a rolling-
friction model with β = 4.

The main distinguishing feature between the various models for friction is the diﬀerent
time dependences (62) for the angular velocity Ω as angle α decreases. An experiment should
be performed to determine whether any of these models corresponds to the practical physics.

2.7 “Rising” of a Rotating Disk When Nearly Vertical (α ≈ π/2)

A rotating disk can exhibit “rising” when launched with spin about a nearly vertical diameter,
provided there is slippage at the point of contact with the horizontal plane. That is, the

10

plane of the disc may rise ﬁrst towards the vertical, before eventually falling towards the
horizontal.

The rising of tops appears to have been considered by Euler, but rather inconclusively.
The present explanation based on sliding friction can be traced to a note by “H.T.” in 1839
[4].

Brieﬂy, we consider motion that is primarily rotation about a nearly vertical diameter.

The angular velocity about the vertical is Ω > qg/a(k + 1), large enough so that “sleeping”

at the vertical is possible. The needed sliding friction depends on angular velocity component
ω1 = bΩ/a being nonzero, which implies that the center of mass moves in a circle of radius
b ≪ a in the present case. Then, ω1 ≪ Ω, and the angular momentum (16) is L ≈ −Ωˆ3,
which is almost vertically upwards (see Fig. 1). Rising depends on slippage of the disk at
the point of contact such that the lowermost point on the disk is not at rest but moves
with velocity −ǫaω1ˆ2, which is opposite to the direction of motion of the center of mass.
Corresponding to this slippage, the horizontal surface exerts friction Fsˆ2 on the disk, with
Fs > 0. The related torque, Ns = aˆ3 × Fsˆ2 = −aFsˆ1, pushes the angular momentum
towards the vertical, and the center of mass of the disk rises.

The most dramatic form of rising motion is that of a “tippe” top, which has recently

been reviewed by Gray and Nickel [5].

2.8 Summary of the Motion of a Disk Spun Initially About a

Vertical Diameter

If a uniform disk is given a large initial angular velocity about a vertical diameter, and
the initial horizontal velocity of the center of mass is very small, the disk will “sleep” until
friction at the point of contact reduces the angular velocity below that of condition (49). The
disk will then appear to fall over rather quickly into a rocking motion with angle α ≈ 60◦
(sec. 2.5). After this, the vertical angular velocity Ω will increase ever more rapidly, while
angle α decreases, until the disk loses contact with the table at a value of α of a few degrees
sec. 2.6). The disk then quickly settles on to the horizontal surface. One hears sound at
frequency Ω/2π, which becomes dramatically higher until the sound abruptly ceases. But if
one observes a ﬁgure on the face of the disk, this rotates every more slowly and seems almost
to have stopped moving before the sounds ceases (sec. 2.3).

If the initial motion of the disk included a nonzero initial velocity in addition to the spin
about a vertical diameter, the center of mass will initially move in a circle whose radius
could be large (sec. 2.3). If the initial vertical angular velocity is small, the disc will roll in
a large circle, tilting slightly inwards until the rolling angular velocity ω1 drops below that
of condition (48). While in most cases the angle α of the disk will then quickly drop to 60◦
or so, occasionally α will rise back towards 90◦ before falling (sec. 2.7). As the disk rolls and
spins, the center of mass traces an inward spiral on average, but nutations about this spiral
can be seen, often accompanied by a rattling sound. The nutation is especially prominent
for α ≈ 10 − 15◦ at which time a very low beat frequency between that of primary spin and
that of the small oscillation can be observed (sec. 2.5). As α decreases below this, the radius
of the circle traced by the center of mass becomes very small, and the subsequent motion is

that of a disk without horizontal center of mass motion.

2.9 The Tangent Toy “Euler’s Disk”

An excellent science toy that illustrates the topic of this article is “Euler’s Disk”, distributed
by Tangent Toy Co. [6]. Besides the disk itself, a base is included that appears to be the key
to the superior performance exhibited by this toy. The surface of the base is a thin, curved
layer of glass, glued to a plastic backing. The base rests on three support points to minimize
rocking.

As the disk rolls on the base, the latter is noticeably deformed. If the same disk is rolled
on a smooth, hard surface such as a granite surface plate, the motion dies out more quickly,
and rattling sounds are more prominent. It appears that a small amount of ﬂexibility in the
base is important in damping the perturbations of the rolling motion if long spin times are
to be achieved.

Thus, high-performance rolling motion is not strictly a rigid-body phenomenon. However,

we do not pursue the theme of elasticity further in this paper.

The concave shape of the Tangent Toy base helps center the rolling motion of the disk,

and speeds up the reduction of an initially nonzero radius b to the desirable value of zero.

An analysis of the motion of a rolling disk on a curved surface is more complex than that
of rolling on a horizontal plane because there are four rather than three degrees of freedom
in the former case, but only three equations of motion. A discussion of a disk rolling inside
a sphere on an orbit far from the lowest point of the sphere has been given in [7].

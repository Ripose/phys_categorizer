A Capacitor Paradox

1 Problem

Two capacitors of equal capacitance C are connected in parallel by zero-resistance wires and
a switch, as shown in the lefthand ﬁgure below. Initially the switch is open, one capacitor
is charged to voltage V0 and the other is uncharged. At time t = 0 the switch is closed. If
there were no damping mechanism, the circuit would then oscillate forever, at a frequency
dependent on the self inductance L and the capacitance C. However, even in a circuit with
zero Ohmic resistance, damping occurs due to the radiation of the oscillating charges, and
eventually a static charge distribution results.

1. How much energy is stored in the system before and (a long time) after the switch is

closed? The paradox is that these two energies are not equal.

2. Verify that the “missing” stored energy has been radiated away by the transient current
after the switch was closed. (Recall that in Poynting’s view, the energy the energy that
is transferred from one capacitor to the other passes through the intervening space,
not down the connecting wires.)

For this, you may assume that the wires form a circle of radius a and that the con-
duction currents in the capacitor plates may be neglected. In this approximation the
current in the wires is spatially uniform. You may neglect the charge accumulation
in the wires compared to that on the capacitor plates, in which case the total electric
dipole moment of the system is constant and magnetic dipole radiation dominates.
Also ignore the self inductance of the circuit.

The “radiation resistance” of this circuit causes a voltage drop Vw to occur along the
nominally zero-resistance wires that can be identiﬁed as

Vw(t) =

Prad(t)
I(t)

,

(1)

where Prad is the radiated power and I(t) is the current in the wire. That is, the
radiating wires act like a third circuit element that can be combined with the two

1

capacitors in an analysis of the voltage and current in the circuit, as sketched in the
equivalent circuit above.

From this circuit analysis deduce a (nonlinear) diﬀerential equation for the diﬀerence
in voltages on the two capacitors, V12 = V1
V2, which has an exponential solution.
Using this solution, verify that the total radiated energy is equal to the loss of energy
stored in the capacitors after the switch is closed. Also, give the magnitude of the
radiation resistance (in Ohms).

3. Extend the analysis to include self inductance.

2 Solution

This problem is adapted from “The two-capacitor problem with radiation” by T.B. Boylan,
D. Hite and N. Singh, Am. J. Phys. 70, 415 (2002).

1. The energy stored in a capacitor of capacitance C that is charged to voltage V is

U = CV 2/2. Hence the initial stored energy of the system is

A long time after the switch has been closed the initial charge is equally distributed
between the two capacitors, each of which is now at voltage V0/2. Hence, the ﬁnal
stored energy of the system is

2. To calculate the radiated power we note that the stated approximations are such that
electric multipole radiation by the circuit may be neglected, and magnetic dipole ra-
diation dominates. The magnetic moment m of the circuit is (in Gaussian units)

where c is the speed of light. According to the Larmor formula, the radiated power is

The capacitance C in eq. (13) is representative of the total capacitance of the system,
which can never be much smaller than length a, since the capactiance of the wires alone
has roughly this value. Hence, the time constant of the discharge of the capacitors obeys
a/c. That is, the discharge time is longer than the transit time of light across the

circuit.

The total radiated power can now be calculated, combining eqs. (5), (9), (11) and (13),

and is indeed equal to the “missing” stored energy.

Finally, we identify the radiation resistance by combining eqs. (8), (9) and (11) (ignor-
ing the self inductance) in the form

Thus,

behavior of the circuit if radiation is neglected. Then, the circuit equation (10) reduces
to the form

In the case of overdamped “oscillations”, the self inductance is largely ignorable and
the analysis given in item 2 is still valid. For weakly damped oscillations, the second
term on the righthand side of eq. (12) is small compared to the ﬁrst, so an iterative
solution for 1/τ follows readily. But as the details are not particularly illuminating we
leave them to readers more motivated by practice than by principle.

Abstract

We present a new derivation of the expressions for momentum and energy of a
relativistic particle. Contrary to the procedures commonly adopted in textbooks,
the one suggested here requires only the knowledge of the composition law for veloc-
ities along one spatial dimension and does not make use of the concept of relativistic
mass. The basic ideas are very general and can be applied also to kinematics diﬀer-
ent from the Newtonian and Einstein ones, in order to construct the corresponding
dynamics.

1 Introduction

In textbooks dealing with relativistic dynamics at an introductory level one can ﬁnd,
basically, three kinds of justiﬁcations for the expression

p(u) =

m u

u2/c2

(1.1)

of linear momentum for a relativistic particle with mass m and velocity u:

1. Requiring momentum conservation in all inertial frames for an elastic collision where
particles are deﬂected from their initial line of ﬂight [1]. Within this approach, the
discussion is not entirely trivial, because of the two-dimensional character of the
process. Also, one wonders why one needs to invoke a second space dimension at all.
What happens if we restrict ourselves to study motion along a straight line? There
ought to be a way to ﬁnd p(u) without going “outside” in the second dimension.

2. Requiring momentum conservation for a head-on elastic collision together with con-
servation of a “relativistic mass” [2]. This circumvents the previous diﬃculty, but

the use of a relativistic mass, and the pedagogical value of such a concept, have been
strongly criticised [3]. (However, see [4] for diﬀerent opinions about this issue.) Of
course, what is used in this approach is actually conservation of energy E, but why
then should one assume that p = Eu/c2?

3. Working with four-vectors, so one deﬁnes four-momentum just in the same way as
the three-momentum of Newtonian theory, but with the three-velocity replaced by
the four-velocity [5]. The problem here is that there is no guarantee, a priori , that
such a quantity will be conserved for an isolated system. Indeed, the conservation
law is usually checked for the case of a simple elastic collision, after four-momentum
has been deﬁned. Also, this approach requires the introduction of radically new
ideas, hence it is unsuitable for a conceptually elementary presentation of the theory.

There is a fourth approach, which to our knowledge has never been adopted, that
resembles to 1 above but is cleaner and can be consistently applied even in one space
dimension only. It is based on the remark that, if energy is conserved in all inertial frames,
then “something else” is also conserved. In the nonrelativistic regime, this “something
else” turns out to coincide with linear momentum. We suggest to do the same at the
relativistic level.

The philosophy behind such a procedure is that energy and momentum are nothing
else than functions of mass and velocity that, under suitable conditions, happen to be
conserved. This is why we treat in a special way those functions, rather than others. This
point of view deserves to be emphasised in a pedagogical exposition, because it provides
a clear insight on the reason why momentum and energy are deﬁned the way they are, at
the same time demystifying their meaning.

We deﬁne kinetic energy for a particle as a scalar quantity whose change equals the
work done on the particle, as in Newtonian and in relativistic mechanics. Then, for a
system of noninteracting particles kinetic energy is necessarily additive, since work is.

With this notion of kinetic energy, our discussion is based on the following two physical

postulates:

P1. The principle of relativity;

P2. The existence of elastic collisions between otherwise free particles.

The treatment is therefore very general, and can be applied to a wide class of theories.
Indeed, as discussed by Mermin [6], postulate P1 alone is compatible with a generalised
kinematics, characterised by an arbitrary function ϕ that deﬁnes the composition law
for velocities. Using P2, we show how to construct from ϕ the expressions for kinetic
energy, momentum, the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian for a free particle in an inertial
frame. Hence, the entire basis of dynamics is uniquely determined by the function ϕ.
Given the pedagogical character of the present paper, we focus only on the Newtonian
and Einstein cases. The dynamics corresponding to all possible forms of ϕ are investigated
systematically in Ref. [7].

The paper is structured as follows. In Sec. 2 we present the basic ideas. In Sec. 3 we
review the main points behind Mermin’s discussion of the composition law for velocities.
Then, in Sec. 4 we present the general derivation of the expressions for momentum,
kinetic energy, the Lagrangian, and the Hamiltonian. In Sec. 5 we apply these results

Deriving relativistic momentum and energy

to construct the basis of Newtonian and Einstein dynamics. Section 6 contains some
concluding comments about the diﬀerent status of energy and momentum conservation,
and the fact that there are no other conservation laws in one spatial dimension.

With the exception of Sec. 2, we restrict ourselves to considering motion along one
space dimension. This makes the material accessible to a student with an elementary
knowledge of calculus. In particular, no knowledge of vector algebra is required, contrary
to what happens in approaches 1 and 3 above. The extension to three space dimensions is
almost straightforward, but we prefer to postpone it to another publication for pedagogical
clarity.

2 Main ideas

Consider the following argument in Newtonian mechanics, originally due to Huygens [8].

Expanding the squares, and using Eq. (2.1), one immediately gets

(m1u1 + m2u2) · v = (m1u′

1 + m2u′

2) · v .

(2.3)

Since this must hold for an arbitrary vector v, momentum conservation follows immedi-
ately.

The idea behind this derivation of the expression for momentum can easily be gen-
eralised to any theory satisfying postulates P1 and P2. More precisely, let T (u) be the
kinetic energy of a particle with velocity u in an inertial frame
. In an elastic collision,

dependence with the indices 1 and 2 on T .) With respect to

(2.5)

,

where now ¯u = Φ(u, v) is the composition law for velocities. On expanding Eq. (2.5)
in the variable v and using Eq. (2.4), we ﬁnd a conservation equation to ﬁrst order in
v, analogous to the one expressed by Eq. (2.3) — although with diﬀerent coeﬃcients, in
general. We can then deﬁne linear momentum1 p as the ﬁrst-order coeﬃcient in v. If we
know the function T (u), then we can ﬁnd p.

1With this deﬁnition, linear momentum turns out to be a one-form rather than a vector, which is very

satisfactory from a formal point of view.

Deriving relativistic momentum and energy

If we do not already know T (u), we can deﬁne it by following the same procedure as

in Newtonian mechanics. First, deﬁne the power (work per unit time)

where F is the total force acting on the particle. Then, use Newton’s second law

to get also

Finally, deﬁne a function T (u) such that

W := F · u ,

dp
dt

= F

W =

dp

· u .

dT

= W

(this is possible since using Newton’s second law we have equated power to a purely kinetic
quantity). Putting together the relation

dT = dp · u

(2.10)

so obtained, and the one that expresses p in terms of T (u), one can ﬁnd both T (u)
and p(u).
In the following, we shall adopt Eq. (2.10) as a fundamental relationship
between kinetic energy and momentum, that stands up on its own, independently of any
justiﬁcation like the one based on Eqs. (2.6)–(2.9).

3 Velocity composition law

We now restrict ourselves to considering motion along one spatial dimension. Suppose
that a particle moves with velocity u with respect to a reference frame

Finally, from the relativity principle it follows [6] that Φ satisﬁes the associative law,

i.e., that

Φ(Φ(u, v), w) = Φ(u, Φ(v, w)) ,

u, v, w .

∀

Therefore, Eq. (3.1) gives the composition law of a group, with neutral element 0 and
left- and right-inverses given by Eqs. (3.3) and (3.4). Note that the inverses vL and vR of
v are not necessarily equal to

v.

The meaning of ϕ can be found by expanding ¯u to the ﬁrst order in v:

This is the composition law between an arbitrary velocity u and a velocity v with small
magnitude. Since Eq. (3.2) implies ϕ(0) = 1, at very small speeds one recovers Galilean
kinematics.

Another interesting property of ϕ is that if some velocity, say C, is invariant, then

ϕ(C) = 0. This follows immediately by applying Eq. (3.6) to the condition

which expresses the invariance of C.

The function ϕ contains all the information needed to specify Φ.

Indeed, it is not

diﬃcult to show [6] that Φ can be written as

where

and h(0) = 0. As a corollary of Eq. (3.9), one ﬁnds that the composition law among
collinear velocities is also commutative, i.e.,

It is worth stressing, however, that this property does not hold in general for the com-
position law of velocities along arbitrary directions in more than one spatial dimension
[9].

With further requirements, essentially equivalent to homogeneity of space and time,
and spatial isotropy (or better, its one-dimensional counterpart — the physical equivalence
of the two orientations in the one-dimensional space), one can further restrict ϕ to the
form

ϕ(u) = 1

K u2 ,

where K is a constant [6]. Moreover, the possibility K < 0 can be excluded on physical
grounds.

(3.13)

This leads to Einstein’s composition law, with the speed of light replaced by 1/√K.
Hence, the mathematical structure of Einstein’s composition law is a consequence of the
principle of relativity alone, combined with the postulates of homogeneity of space and
time, and of spatial isotropy. Remarkably, this was known to Kaluza already in 1924 [10].
An analogous result about the structure of the Lorentz transformation was obtained by
von Ignatowsky in 1910 [11], and has been rediscovered many times since [12]. (See also
Refs. [13] for a rigorous derivation, and Refs. [14] for clear presentations at the textbook
level.)

4 General analysis

We now carry on the programme outlined in Sec. 2, deriving the general expressions for
momentum and kinetic energy (Sec. 4.1), the Lagrangian (Sec. 4.2), and the Hamilto-
nian (Sec. 4.3) for a free particle, that follow from postulates P1 and P2 when a given
composition law for velocities is adopted.

4.1 Momentum and kinetic energy

Let T (u) be the kinetic energy of a particle in a reference frame where the particle velocity
is u.
(Of course, T (u) may depend on some invariant parameters characterising the
particle, in addition to its velocity. For example, in Newtonian dynamics it depends on
the particle mass.) In an inertial frame, T (u) is conserved for a free particle, because u is
constant, by the principle of inertia. Then, the total kinetic energy is conserved also for
a system of noninteracting particles.

According to postulate P2, there are spatially localised interactions between particles
which do not change the total kinetic energy. It is then easy to see that there is another
additive quantity which is conserved in any theory in which a relativity principle holds
(postulate P1). More speciﬁcally, if the composition law for velocities is given by Eq.
(3.1), such a quantity is, for a single particle,

p(u) = ϕ(u)

dT (u)
du

,

where ϕ(u) is the function deﬁned by Eq. (3.6).

The proof of this statement relies on the generalisation of Huygens’ argument outlined
during a head-on

in Sec. 2. Let us write energy conservation in two inertial frames

We have used the same functions T1 and T2 in both reference frames because of the
relativity principle. We can expand the generic function T (¯u) around v = 0, and use the
property (3.2) to get

T (¯u) = T (u) +

ϕ(u) v +

dT (u)

(v2) .

Doing this for each term in Eq. (4.3) and using Eq. (4.2), then dividing by v and taking
the limit for v

This proves the claim above.

Of course, Eq. (4.1) is not suﬃcient in order to ﬁnd an expression for momentum,
since the function T (u) is also unknown. However, as already discussed in Sec. 2, we can
deﬁne kinetic energy so that its variation gives the work done on the particle — that is,
impose the validity of Eq. (2.10). Combining Eq. (2.10) in its one-dimensional version
with Eq. (4.1), we obtain a diﬀerential equation for the function p(u):

dp
du

=

p
u ϕ(u)

.

Integrating by separation of variables, one ﬁnds the expression for p(u). In general, we
can write

p(u) = m exp

u

du′

1
u′ ϕ(u′)

,

Z
where m is a constant parameter that can vary from particle to particle. Mathematically,
m represents the arbitrary constant associated with the general solution of the diﬀeren-
tial equation (4.6). Physically, it is identiﬁed with the particle mass by imposing the
Newtonian limit for u

0.

Finally, one can replace p(u) into Eq. (4.1), and integrate with the condition T (0) = 0

→

to obtain also the expression for T (u):

4.2 Lagrangian

The Lagrangian should satisfy the relation

Using Eq. (4.1), we obtain

T (u) =

p(u) =

dL(u) = ϕ(u)

du .

Obviously, it is only for ϕ = 1 that L = T + const, so the Lagrangian for a free particle
coincides with the kinetic energy only in Newtonian dynamics.

For possible zero-mass particles, no expressions p(u) and T (u) exist, so a Lagrangian

formulation is impossible.

4.3 Hamiltonian

Equation (2.10) allows us to identify the Hamiltonian for a free particle. Indeed,

u =

dT (u)

du ,

dp(u)
du

=

dT (u)
du

du(p)
dp

=

dT (u(p))
dp

.

On the other hand, one of Hamilton’s equations of motion is

(4.11)

(4.12)

u =

dH(p)
dp

,

so one can write H(p) as T (u(p)), up to a u-independent additive term. Apart from u,
the only other parameter T depends on is the particle mass m, so we have in general

H(p, m) = T (u(p, m), m) + E0(m) ,

(4.13)

where we have made explicit the dependence of the various quantities on m, and E0(m)
denotes the value of the Hamiltonian when p = 0. Since, numerically, H coincides with
the particle energy E, it follows from Eq. (4.13) that

E(u, m) = T (u, m) + E0(m) ,

(4.14)

so E0(m) can be interpreted as the particle rest energy.

Of course, the same expression for H can be obtained as the Legendre transform [15]

of L.

5 Special cases

Let us now apply the general results derived in the previous section to the two cases of
pedagogical interest, namely Newtonian and Einstein dynamics.

5.1 Newtonian dynamics

The composition law is simply

Φ(u, v) = u + v ,

(5.1)

so ϕ(u) = 1. From Eq. (4.6) one then ﬁnds immediately p(u) = m u which, replaced into
Eq. (4.8), gives T (u) = m u2/2.

The Lagrangian coincides with the kinetic energy, as already noted. In order to get

the Hamiltonian, we ﬁrst express velocity as a function of momentum, u(p) = p/m, so

H(p) =

+ E0(m) .

p2
2 m

(5.2)

The choice E0(m) = 0 is obviously the simplest. Zero-mass particles cannot exist in this
theory.

The Lagrangian is

As already pointed out at the end of Sec. 4.2, no Lagrangian formulation exists for zero-
mass particles.

Inverting Eq. (5.5) we get

Now, the simplest choice is E0(m) = mc2. In this theory we can treat also zero-mass
particles, for which H(p) = p c.

6 Comments

The most important result presented in this paper is the theorem in Sec. 4. Broadly,
its meaning is that, in theories obeying postulates P1 and P2, kinematics “determines”
dynamics. As applications, we have shown how to recover the expressions for the quanti-
ties on which dynamics is based, in the two cases of Newtonian and Einstein mechanics.
Of course, one may consider other types of dynamics as well [7], based on alternative
kinematics but still obeying postulates P1 and P2.

Energy conservation in one inertial frame, together with the relativity principle, implies
energy conservation in all inertial frames. As we have seen, this leads to momentum
conservation. In fact, on replacing Eq. (4.1) into Eq. (4.4), one ﬁnds

T (¯u) = T (u) + p(u) v +

(v2) ,

O

(6.1)

Deriving relativistic momentum and energy

which holds in general. In particular, Eq. (6.1) is consistent with the law of transformation
for energy both in Newtonian and Einstein dynamics, where

T (¯u) = T (u) +

mv2 + v p(u)

(6.2)

and

E(¯u) = γ(v) (E(u) + v p(u)) ,
(6.3)
respectively, with E(u) = mc2+T (u) in the second case. Now, it is well known that energy
conservation is related to invariance under time translations, while momentum conserva-
tion is related to invariance under space translations. Hence, the relativity principle has,
apparently, the eﬀect of generating invariance under space translations from the invari-
ance under time translations. (In other words, homogeneity of time in all inertial frames
enforces also homogeneity of space.) This is indeed the case, as one can easily understand
thinking that what appears purely as a time displacement in an inertial frame, acquires a
spatial component in any other frame with v
= 0. This is true in general, not only for a
Lorentz transformation. For example, for a Galilean transformation between two frames
= 0

one has ¯x = x + v t. Then, if two events have time and space separations ∆t
= 0.

already by examining the cases of a Lorentz and a Galilean transformation. In the ﬁrst

Hence, one can enforce energy conservation by requiring momentum conservation in every
inertial frame.2 On the other hand, in Newtonian mechanics Eq. (6.4) is replaced by

from which one gets

p(¯u) = p(u) + m v ,

dp(u)
du

ϕ(u) = m .

Therefore, momentum conservation in all inertial frames now enforces conservation of
mass, rather than of energy. This asymmetry is related to the fact that, while under a
Lorentz transformation a purely spatial displacement acquires a time component, this is
not true for a Galilean transformation. Indeed, since for the latter one has ¯t = t, it will
be ∆¯t = ∆t regardless of what ∆x is.

Of course, there is no reason to stop the analysis in Sec. 4.1 to the ﬁrst order in
v. In fact, by considering the second order, then the third order, and so on, an inﬁnite

set of conserved quantities can be generated. Unfortunately, these “new” quantities are
not independent and do not give anything new, as one might also expect noticing that
conservation of energy and momentum already exploit the available symmetries, namely,
homogeneity of time and space. It is instructive, however, to see explicitly what happens
in the two dynamics considered throughout this paper.

In Newtonian dynamics, at the second order in v one recovers conservation of mass
(which follows, however, from our assumption that masses do not change during a col-
lision), while at still higher orders all coeﬃcients vanish identically — see Eq. (2.2). In
Einstein dynamics, at the second order one ﬁnds conservation of energy E which, once
again, amounts to conservation of mass when one considers that T is also conserved,
by postulate P2. At orders higher than two the situation is a bit more involved. It is
convenient ﬁrst to rewrite the second equation in (6.3) as

E(Φ(u, v)) = E(u) γ(v) + p(u) γ(v) v .

(6.8)

Now, the coeﬃcient γ(v) which appears on the right-hand side of Eq. (6.8) is a function
of v2, so the coeﬃcients of the expansion of E(Φ(u, v)) in powers of v will all be equal
to E(u) for even powers, and to p(u) for odd powers. Since E and T diﬀer only by a
velocity-independent quantity, one just recovers the conservation of energy and momen-
tum, alternatively.

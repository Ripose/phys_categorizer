Abstract. A simple and illustrative rheonomic system is explored in the Lagrangian
formalism. The diﬀerence between Jacobi’s integral and energy is highlighted. A sharp
contrast with remarks found in the literature is pointed out. The non-conservative
system possess a Lagrangian not explicitly dependent on time and consequently there
is a Jacobi’s integral. The Lagrange undetermined multiplier method is used as a
complement to obtain a few interesting conclusions.

Exploring a rheonomic system

Constraints are restrictions that limit the motion of the particles of a system.
The forces necessary to constrain the motion are said to be forces of constraint. The
constraints expressible as algebraic equations relating the coordinates of the particles
and the time variable are called holonomic,
if not they are called nonholonomic.
Furthermore, in each type of constraints, holonomic or nonholonomic, the time variable
could appear explicitly. If the time variable does not appear explicitly in the relations
of constraint they are further classiﬁed as scleronomic, otherwise they are said to be
rheonomic.

Holonomic constraints, and in fact a very restrict class of nonholonomic constraints
(those expressible as ﬁrst-order diﬀerential forms relating the coordinates and the time
variable), are amenable to straightforward general treatment in analytical mechanics.
These sorts of constraints allow us to describe the motion without paying any explicit
reference to the forces of constraint. In addition, holonomic constraints can be used to
reduce the number of coordinates required to the complete description of the motion,
although this is not always desirable.

Simple systems subject to rheonomic constraints are not widespread in the
textbooks on analytical mechanics. Nevertheless, there is a traditional system which is
very simple, indeed. It consists of a bead of mass m sliding along a frictionless straight
horizontal wire constrained to rotate with constant angular velocity ω about a vertical
axis [1][2][4][3][5]. This simple system presents a wealth of physics not fully explored in
the literature. The main purpose of this paper is to make an eﬀort for ﬁlling this gap,
motivated by the strong pedagogical appeal of this illustrative system. Furthermore, this
paper takes the opportunity of doing criticisms on the remarks in Griﬀths’s textbook [6]
concerning general systems containing rheonomic holonomic systems: “...the rheonomic
constraints must be used to reduce the number of generalised coordinates and so the
conﬁguration of the system must necessarily depend explicitly on time as well as the n
generalized coordinates. In this case a time dependence thus enters explicitly into the
Lagrangian. It may therefore also be concluded that systems which contain a rheonomic
constraint possess neither an energy integral nor a Jacobi integral.”

First, one can note that the motion of the bead is caused by a force of constraint
perpendicular to the wire, whereas the actual displacement of the bead is in an oblique
direction and its virtual displacement satisfying the constraint is in a parallel direction.
Therefore, the force of constraint does actual work but not virtual work. The vanishing
of the virtual work characterizes the constraint as ideal.

Since the motion of the bead takes place on the horizontal plane one can eliminate
the dependence on the vertical coordinate and consider only the coordinates on the
plane of the motion. The coordinates are suitably chosen with r being the distance to
the rotation axis and θ the angular position relative to an arbitrary axis on the plane
of the motion. The Lagrangian of the system is nothing but the kinetic energy of the
bead:

Φ (θ, t) = θ − ωt + θ0 = 0

where θ0 is a constant. This form of the condition of constraint allow us to classify it
as a holonomic and rheonomic constraint. Now one can use this condition of constraint
to eliminate the coordinate θ in the Lagrangian, so that one is left with r as generalized
coordinate:

L =

˙r2 + ω2r2

(cid:17)

At this point the author dares to utter the ﬁrst criticism on Griﬀths’s conclusions. The
conﬁguration of the system is just given by the coordinate r, which clearly depends on
the time variable, but neither the kinetic energy nor the Lagrangian are explicitly time-
dependent. In general rheonomic constraints give rise to explicitly time dependent terms
in the Lagrangian. There are two of these terms, one of them is linear in the generalized
velocities and the other one is velocity-independent. Due to these terms it may tempting
to conclude that the Lagrangian for a rheonomic system is always explicitly time
dependent, but it is very dangerous because it may be certain cancellations. For the
particular system approached in this paper and with the particular choice of generalized
coordinates, the variables combine in such a way that the linear term vanishes whereas
the independent term does not involve the time explicitly. That is the reason why the
Lagrangian has no explicit time dependence.

Since the Lagrangian is not an explicit function of time

turns out to be Jacobi’s integral, a constant of the motion. Now arises the second
criticism on Griﬃths’s comments: although this system contains a rheonomic constraint
it in fact possess a Jacobi’s integral. The necessary and suﬃcient condition for the
existence of Jacobi’s integral is that the Lagrangian does not depend explicitly on time.
It is seen that here Jacobi’s integral is not the energy of the system. The only diﬀerence
between them is due to the velocity-independent term in the Lagrangian. The energy
of the system is only kinetic energy and has a time derivative given by

The insertion of the equation of motion (6) into the last relation leads to

which implies that the energy is not a constant of the motion. As we have already seen,
the energy can not be a constant of the motion due to the nonvanishing of the actual
work of the force of constraint.

It should be obvious that the energy function h and the energy E are distinctly
diﬀerent functions,
subject to distinct conservation laws, but there are special
circumstances for which they are identical. This happens if the constraints are
scleronomic and the potential energy is velocity-independent. If, further, the potential
energy does not depend explicitly on time E becomes the energy integral and h comes to
be Jacobi’s integral. In addition to these comments is appropriated to keep in mind that
the energy function h must not be confused with the Hamiltonian H, even though they
are expressed by similar mathematical structures and their conservation laws rest upon

the very same condition (not depend explicitly on time). The diﬀerence between h and
H is subtler than that one between h and E, they are functions of diﬀerent independent
variables. As a matter of fact, in some cases it may not be possible to obtain one of
them from the knowledge from the other.

Usually one must use the Lagrange undetermined multiplier method to obtain the
force of constraint. In this method the coordinates r and θ are not treated as independent
coordinates, therefore one has to use the Lagrangian given by (1) instead of that one
given by (4). Now Lagrange’s equations incorporate the condition of constraint

where λ is the Lagrange undetermined multiplier. The generalized forces of constraint
are to be identiﬁed as λ∂Φ/∂r and λ∂Φ/∂θ. The condition of constraint (3) implies
that only the torque of constraint τ is nonvanishing. These Lagrange’s equations yield

In conclusion, this paper shows that the system considered is of great value for
beginning students of analytical mechanics.
In addition, it is very useful to remove
some misunderstandings found in the literature. It should be emphasized that is the
rheonomic nature of the constraint and the particular choice of generalized coordinates
that make the energy to be diﬀerent from Jacobi’s integral. Jacobi’s integral is here the
ﬁrst integral of the motion instead of the energy. The Lagrange undetermined multiplier
method has been used for obtaining the force of constraint in a natural way. Nonethe-
less, the force of constraint can also be obtained from (12) by invoking the principle of
work and energy. Only the Lagrangian formalism has been considered in this paper but
this simple system can also be easily approached by other formalisms of the analytical
mechanics. This task is left to the readers.

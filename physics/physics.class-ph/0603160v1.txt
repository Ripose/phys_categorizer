Abstract Explicit solutions of the two-dimensional ﬂoating body problem
(bodies that can ﬂoat in all positions) for relative density ρ
2 and of the
tire track problem (tire tracks of a bicycle, which do not allow to determine,
which way the bicycle went) are given, which diﬀer from circles. Starting point
is the diﬀerential equation given in [9, 10].

Introduction

−

In this paper explicit solutions are given to the two-dimensional version of the
ﬂoating body problem asked by Stanislaw Ulam in the Scottish Book[5] (problem
19): Is a sphere the only solid of uniform density which will ﬂoat in water in
any position? A large class of two-dimensional cross-sections diﬀerent from the
circle were found for bodies of relative density ρ = 1
2 by Auerbach[2]. Here we
= 1
address to the case ρ
2 .

It has been shown[2], that in two dimensions such a body has the property,
that any chord dissecting the body in two pieces whose areas are the fractions
ρ and 1
ρ of the whole area must have the same constant length 2ℓ. Two
equivalent properties are: (i) Let us consider two close-by water-lines through
the cross-section, A1A2 and B1B2. (We keep the body ﬁxed and assumed the
direction of the gravitational force being rotated.) We put the x-axis parallel to
A1A2. Then the vector A1B1 is given by (dx1,
l1dφ) and A2B2 by (dx2, l2dφ).
Constant length dℓ = 0 implies dx2 = dx1. Constant areas implies df1 =
1
2 l2
2dφ. Thus l1 = l2 = ℓ. This implies, that the the inﬁnitesimal
2(dφ)2
arcs at the perimeter du1 =
are equal. Thus the part of the perimeter below the water-line is constant. Oﬀ
course the same is true for the part above the water-line. One can conclude the
other way round: If a curve has the property, that if we move from two ﬁxed
points A1 and A2 by constant arcs u along the perimeter and the length of the
chord remains ﬁxed, then also the areas separated by the chord stay constant.
We argue, that since ℓ stays constant we have dx1 = dx2. Since du1 = du2

1(dφ)2 and du2 =

1dφ = df2 = 1

(dx2)2 + l2

(dx1)2 + l2

2 l2

also l1 = l2 and thus df1 = df2. In the main part of the paper we will use this
property. By measuring the arc from a ﬁxed point of the boundary we introduce
the arc parameter u. We will show that for certain diﬀerences 2δu of the arc
parameter the length of the chord is constant, that is the distance between
δu and at arc parameter u + δu is constant.

(ii) Another interesting property is, that since l1 = l2, one has dy1 =

dy2,
which implies, that the angles δ between the tangents and the chord are equal,
δ1 = δ2.

−

The ﬂoating body problem is related to the tire track problem([7] and papers
cited therein). Let me denote the boundary of the body by Γ and the envelope
of the waterlines, which consists actually of the midpoints of the chords, by γ.
Let the distance between the front and the rear wheel of a bicycle be ℓ. Then
if the front wheel moves along the curve Γ and the rear wheel started on γ,
then it will stay on γ. Since however any tangent through a point on γ meets
Γ in the two ends of the chord, the bicycle can move both ways on the same
tracks. The tire track problem consists in ﬁnding such curves Γ, γ diﬀerent from
circles, which thus do not allow to determine which way the bicycle went. It
is equivalent to the two-dimensional ﬂoating body problem with the exception
that the tire tracks need not close or may wind several times around some point.
In a recent paper I suggested that one obtains a solution for the boundary

of the ﬂoating body from the diﬀerential equation

1
√r2 + r′2

= ar2 + b + cr

−2,

(1)

where r′ = dr/dψ, with polar coordinates (r, ψ), provided the resulting curve is
suﬃciently convex and closed.

−

By choosing an appropriate condition for the constants a, b, and c the curves
will be closed. They show dihedral Dp symmetry. These curves have the remark-
able property, that they solve the ﬂotation problem for p
2 diﬀerent densities,
which implies that there are [ p−1
2 ] diﬀerent chord lenths. (If the boundary is
the solution for relative density ρ of the body, then it is also solution for density
1
ρ with the same chord length.) These curves show an even more general
property: Let us consider two copies of these curves (not necessarily closed).
Let us choose an arbitrary point on each curve. Then there exists always an
angle by which the two curves can be rotated against each other, so that the
length of the chord between the points on the two curves stays constant, if we
move from the given points by the same arc. This remarkable property made
it possible to obtain the above-mentioned diﬀerential equation by choosing the
two points inﬁnitesimally close [9, 10].

−

In [9, 10] I assumed to have proven, that the solutions have this property,
but Serge Tabachnikov kindly informed me, that this was not correct. What I
had shown, was that if for some chord the angles δ between the chord and the
= r2, that then also the derivative
tangents on the curve obey δ1 = δ2 at r1 6
d(δ1−δ2)
vanishes. This is a necessary condition, but it is not suﬃcient. That
du
it is not suﬃcient, can easily be seen, since from this argument one cannot
u2. Therefore here the diﬀerential equation will be
exclude, that δ1 −

δ2 ∝

2

solved explicitly as a function of the arc parameter u, and it will be shown, that
the curve has the desired property.

First we will introduce an appropriate parametrization. In sect. 3 we deter-
mine the radius r as a function of the arc u, in the next section the polar angle
also as function of u. In section 5 we determine the length of the chord. Consid-
ering the chord between points at arc parameter u
δu and u + δu for ﬁxed δu,
we ﬁnd that the square of the length of the chord can be expressed as a rational
function of the Weierstrass function ℘(u/λ), (λ is a constant scale factor). For
special values of δu the residues vanish and thus the chord length 2ℓ becomes
independent of u. In section 6 we consider the limit, where the curve oscillates
around a straight line. (They do not constitute solutions of the ﬂoating body
problem, but of the tiretrack problem.) There one ﬁnds an inﬁnite set of δus, so
δu
that again the length of the chord between the points of arc parameter u
and u + δu is independent of u. In the last section we shortly discuss various
shapes as they appear for example in the papers by Bracho, Montejano and
Oliveros [6, 3] assuming they obey eq. (1).

With increasing ψ the radius r oscillates periodically between the largest
and the smallest radii r> and r<, resp. We parametrize these extreme radii by

r< = r0(1

We observe, that the polynomial

Useful references for elliptic integrals and elliptic functions are for example
chapter XIII of [4] and chapters 16 to 18 in [1]. The later reference uses m =
k2 instead of k. A few relations are listed in the appendix A.1. The elliptic
functions are double periodic functions, that is there exist two periods 2ωi, the
ratio of which is not real, so that

℘(˜u + 2ωi) = ℘(˜u).

2ω3 is a real period of the ℘ we use here.

Symmetry

Some of the equations given above are not explicitly symmetric with respect to
the change of the sign of ǫ. We realize, that k2 and λ are invariant against such
a sign change. However the expression for the angle ψper of the periodicity of
r(ψ) is not obviously invariant. One can observe however, that the reversal of
the sign of ǫ corresponds to a change from vi to v′
vi. To see this we

Since R(ω3/2) is negative (℘′2(v1) is negative) and ℘′(ω3/2) is also negative,
the sign of Im n3 is given by the sign of i/℘′(v1) which is negative. Thus n3

Again we consider the chord length 2ℓ between the two points at ˜u + δ˜u and ˜u

δ˜u. We are interested in the δ˜u for which the chord length becomes independent
of ˜u. Therefore we determine the diﬀerences of the coordinates. One obtains

7.1 Convexity

curve will lie completely inside the region. Such a convexity is guaranteed, if

This condition is suﬃcient for a ﬂoating body, however, violation of convexity
is allowed for ﬂoating bodies, as long as the chord stays completely inside the
body.

7.2 Radial and perpendicular tangents

If ǫ (η) is not too large, then ψ (x), resp. will be a monotonously increasing
functions of ˜u. For suﬃciently large ǫ however, the curves will bend over. Sup-
pose this happens in the case of a curve winding around the origin at r = r0κ.

Bracho, Montejano and Oliveros [6, 3] have determined tire track curves with
the special restriction, that the arc between the two end points of the chord is
one ﬁfth of the perimeter by introducing a carousel consisting of an equilateral
pentagon with the property, that the midpoints of the sides move parallel to
them. The midpoints describe the tracks γ of the rear wheels. The corners of
the pentagon describe the tracks Γ of the front wheels. They require that all
ﬁve midpoints move on the same curve and consequently the corners describe
the same curves. They have found closed curves for p = 7 (ﬁg. 3 of [3] and
ﬁg. 9 of [6]) and for p = 12 (ﬁg. 1 of [3]).
I do not know, whether these
curves belong to the solutions given here, but I will assume this in the following
discussion. Consequently the curve with p = 7 is simultaneously a tire track
curve Γ for two other chord lengths. Since p is odd, one of the chord lenths
belongs to perimeter ratio 1/2. It is a special Auerbach curve[2], although it is
not convex. Similarly I expect that the curve for p = 12 is a tire track curve
for ﬁve further chord lengths. We note, that the requirement of ﬁnding a closed
curve which winds once around the center and the requirement of spanning one
ﬁfth of the perimeter between the endpoints of the chord yields only discrete
solutions for ǫ and mu, so that one cannot require simultaneously convexity.
Since in our approach the fraction of the perimeter covered by the arc between
the endpoints of the chord can be varied continuously, we can obtain convex
solutions. A solution, which is not convex, but ’suﬃently convex’ to serve for a
ﬂoating body for p = 7 is shown in ﬁg. 4 of [9] and ﬁg. 1 of [10].

Fig. 2 of [3] shows a set of ﬁve curves. They have identical shape, but are
shifted against each other by equal distances. They can be numbered 1 to 5
i) can be
and have the property, that any pair of curves i and i + 1 (i + 5
connected by a chord of constant length, as the ends of the chord move by equal
arc lengths. This is in agreement with the behavior we described in the linear
case. Here however, the authors required, that after traversing through ﬁve

≡

20

chords, one does not only return to the initial curve but even to the same point.
(The corners of the equilateral pentagons can be well seen at the left ends and at
the right ends of the depicted parts of the curves.) From the discussion in this
paper I conclude, that there is an inﬁnity of chord lengths with this property, if
one waives the requirement, that after traversing through ﬁve chords one returns
to the same point. Taking only one of these curves, it is also a tire track curve
for an inﬁnity of chord lengths.

7.3 Eights

An extreme case is the situation, where a curve with tangential or perpendicular
slopes returns to the initial point after an increase of ˜u by 2ω3. Then such a
curve has the shape of an eight and ψper = 0 (eq. 65) and xper = 0 (eq. 145),
resp., have to be fulﬁlled. An example of an eight can be found in ﬁg. 8 of [6].

7.4 Other shapes

In this paper I have assumed during the discussion of the curves, that µ is real
and tacitely
1 < ǫ < 1. Obviously there are also other values of ǫ and µ which
yield real polar coordinates r and ψ. The properties of the corresponding curves
will be investigated elsewhere.

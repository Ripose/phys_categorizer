It is proved that necessary corrections in the Evans-Vigier modiﬁed
electrodynamics invalidate the arguments given by E. Comay [CPL 261
(1996) 601] against this model. Moreover, from the conceptual viewpoint
Evans/Comay discussions in several journals contributed very little to the
modern electromagnetic theory due to many confusions of the both.

Recently, the model proposed by M. Evans and J.-P. Vigier [1] was the object of the
strong critics [2–4]. I cannot consider the replies of M. Evans et al. [5] as suﬃcient ones. In
fact, they contributed additional confusions and misunderstandings to the discussion.1 This
discussion inspired me to express my own opinion on the problem of the longitudinal modes
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, see, e. g., refs. [8,9] and the present paper is the continuation of
my eﬀorts to consider the problem rigorously. I have to mention that I disagree with both
E. Comay and M. Evans et al.

First of all, one should repeat brieﬂy what the authors of the cited works claimed. In
E∗ was ascribed to a
ref. [1] the longitudinal “magnetic ﬁeld” (an axial vector) BΠ ∼
circularly polarized electromagnetic wave. Moreover, in the subsequent papers and books
the B- cyclic relations

were derived. The B(1) and B(2) = B(1) ∗ are the accustomed transverse modes of the circu-
larly polarized electromagnetic wave (see refs. [1,2] for detailed explanation of the notation):

of the “magnetic ﬁeld” in the circular complex basis was deﬁned there. This model has come
across the strong critics. E. Comay recently argued that the model violates the relativistic
covariance principle. See [8] for the discussion of whether this is so.2 Furthermore, on the
basis of the calculation of the line integral in the problem of rotating dipole [6, p.228 of the
Russian edition]3 the author of [2] concluded that “the ﬂux of the electric ﬁeld E through
the area increases indeﬁnitely as time progresses. It follows that if the Maxwell equation

1For instance, in the reply by M. Evans and S. Jeﬀers in FPL [5a] the authors 1) considered
relations which are valid if the circular polarized radiation presents only; 2) in an attempt of a
counterexample they considered another path of integration and, in fact, another type of radiation;
and 3) contradicted the conclusions made in ref. [6] without suﬃcient explanations. So, in my
opinion, their paper [5a] is irrelevant to the counterexamples presented by E. Comay. This was
pointed out by G. Hunter [7].

2As opposed to the opinion of E. Comay [4, p. 252, 9th line from the bottom] the principle of
relativistic covariance means that the physical laws expressed by equations preserve their form in
any frame.

I agree. But, it is easy to show that if one corrects the erroneous statement of M. Evans
that there cannot be any longitudinal components in the linear polarized electromagnetic
wave, then the path integral over the segment SR (see the ﬁgure 2 in [2]) does not vanish
dl, which is equal in the magnitude and opposite in the
and it gives the contribution to
sign to that of the path segment QP . The total path integral
dl is equal to zero, thus

For quantum ﬁeld theorists it is known that the change of the polarization state of
massive particles can be made by the boost (and/or other non-unitary operations). On the
other hand, it appears that for j = 1 states (relevant to the problem at hand) the change of
polarization can be made by means of the change of the basis of the corresponding complex
vector space, i. e. by the rotation. It is produced by an unitary matrix. If one describes the
magnetic ﬁeld as

of the Russian edition], thus giving the circular, elliptical and linear polarizations when considering
radiation emitted in various surface angles. It was claimed by M. Evans (see the reference in [2])
that the B(3) is the property of the circular and, possibly, elliptic polarizations and is equal to zero
(??) in the linear polarization (nevertheless, cf. [10]). So, the problem noted by E. Comay still
may stands at the B(3) theory, if one trusts the Evans claims and if one considers the longitudinal
ﬁeld as a part of an antisymmetric tensor of the second rank. Nevertheless, it is interesting to
note that, apart from the presence of diﬀerent polarizations, the energy ﬂux is not isotropic in the
particular example of Comay. It depends on the polar angle θ as argued by Landau [6, p.228 of
the Russian edition] even in the case of the consideration of time-average ﬂux over the period. All
this may lead to further speculations on the nature of B(3).

4(C) stands for the Evans’ claim that “the magnetic ﬁeld B(3) is not associated with any real
electric ﬁeld” which also may be doubted.

i. e., the similar relation to (1), but already without the phase factor eiπ/2. This conclusion
is in the complete accordance with the Lakhtakia consideration [10a]: the Evans’ ‘magne-
tostatic’ ﬁeld BΠ (or, later, B(3)) “may be deﬁned for other than circularly polarized plane
waves”.

These relations should be applied only in the local system, which is connected with the
observation point and the wave vector. Otherwise, we come across big confusions. If one

i. e., in the latter case one obtains the linear polarized radiation with the polarization angle equal
to π/4 (deﬁned by (7)). Of course, the given unitary matrix can be easily generalized to account
for other polarization angles. Cf. with ref. [11,

7.2].

with α being the polar angle of the cylindrical system of coordinates. In the case of the linear
polarization deﬁned in such a way [7] one has B
B∗ = 0. This transformation may also change
the normalization of the corresponding vectors which in the quantized case correspond to a particle
and an anti-particle. The determinant of the transformation is, in general, not equal to the unit.
While the determinant of our matrix is also not equal to the unit (detU =
i), but the norm
of the corresponding quantum states is still preserved (while this is not so for the corresponding
real quantities). By the way, Landau in
67 did not work in terms of phasors; unfortunately, Dr.
§
E. Comay did also not elaborate this point. So, we do not know, what the deﬁnition of linear
polarized radiation does Landau imply in the problem of the rotating dipole, presented by G.
Hunter or presented by me in this work? Nevertheless, cf. footnotes 3 and 5.

So, with necessary corrections the Evans-Vigier model can be considered as useful and
uncontradictory.7 In fact, the B cyclic relations repeat tautologically the relations between
spin components (after taking into account the normalization), represent an interesting
model, but hardly to be considered as a fundamental theory (at the present level of its
development). Furthermore, one should note that the B(3) theory is not the only candidate
for the appear-to-be necessitated generalization of the Maxwell’s formalism. As I am now
aware the longitudinal components of electromagnetic radiation were considered by many
authors in both XIX and XX centuries, e. g., refs. [9,15]. So, the common belief in the
impossibility of existence of the longitudinal electromagnetic-type interactions appears to
me to be the result of the greatest and uncomprehensible mistake in the history of the XX
century science. In my opinion, the most intriguing and promising theory is the Weinberg
2(2j + 1) component theory [16,17], which also represents the modiﬁed theory of electro-
magnetism [18] and [20a]. The Weinberg theory was shown to be related to the problem of
the so-called Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld [19] (as well as the Evans-Vigier model).

In relation with all the above-mentioned I demonstrated in my recent works (and this

was let to know to Dr. Comay in 1995-1996) that:

•

The 3-vector B(3) (which is deﬁned by (1)) may not be the entry of the antisymmetric
F 21 component but the entry of some 4-vector8 pro-
tensor ﬁeld [8]; it is not the Bz ≡
vided that the Evans’ deﬁnitions for circularly polarized radiation are used.9 Lorentz
transformation rules for (B(0), B(3)) are the following:

Due to the previous item there are no any reasons that the quantity which is not a
part of the antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld F µν satisﬁes the Maxwell’s vacuum equations
∂µF µν = 0 , µ = 0, 1, 2, 3.

7See, nevertheless, the experimental controversy in refs. [12–14].

8This is obvious even from the fact that B(3) is a 3-vector (can possess three components, in the
general case) but Bz is a number, the entry of F µν , the electromagnetic tensor. In the paper [8]
we used the instant form of dynamics. It would be interesting to repeat the calculations in the
light-front form of relativistic dynamics [21].

9It would be still interesting to produce complete investigation of the transformation properties
of the cross products of transverse modes in the case of various deﬁnitions of polarization states.

One can see that in the classical ﬁeld theory antisymmetric tensor ﬁelds are the ﬁelds
with both transverse and longitudinal components in the massless limit. The longitu-
dinal parts of the above equations do not contain the terms as (J
p) provided that
the longitudinal modes are associated with the plane waves too. This can be easily
iǫijk and on using the deﬁnition of the

longitudinal modes, p

for antisymmetric tensor ﬁelds (which are deduced on the basis of the general princi-
ples for deriving relativistic equations) may describe the longitudinal components with

In the recent paper [20d] we considered the general case of 2(2j + 1) component
ﬁeld functions and 4-vector potential in the instant form of relativistic dynamics (cf.
with [23]). The cross products of magnetic ﬁelds of diﬀerent spin states in the momen-
B(−)(p, σ′)) may not be equal to zero and
tum representation (such as B(+)(p, σ)
may be expressed by the “time-like” potential and/or the gauge part of 3-potentials
for diﬀerent spin states (also in the momentum representation):

Concluding, on the basis of this my paper and previous ones I can state that the possible
existence of longitudinal components of antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld (and/or 4-potentials)
does not contradict the principle of relativistic covariance (but can still be related to the
action-at-a-distance concept and topological theories); the curl of longitudinal components
may satisfy the Maxwell equation after the necessary modiﬁcations of the claims made by M.
Evans et al., but this is not too necessary, because one can consider B(3) to be the longitudinal
components of 4-vector potentials (and/or of the polarization vector [7]), which need not
already to satisfy the Maxwell equations for strengths. Finally, we found two ways for the
deﬁnition of the linear polarized radiation; this freedom is related to the unobservability of
phasors — only real electric/magnetic ﬁelds are observable in the classical electrodynamics.

I am thankful to Profs. A. Chubykalo, G. Hunter, R. Kiehn and Y. S. Kim for valuable
discussions. I acknowledge many internet communications of Dr. M. Evans (1995-96) on
the concept of the B(3) ﬁeld, while frequently do not agree with him. I am delighted by the
dedication of Dr. E. Comay, which permitted me to express my opinion on these matters
once again. I consider the Comay’s critics while irrelevant and unreasonable but provocative:
in fact, it is aimed at the indication of some tune points in the Evans-Vigier model, which
are required clariﬁcations and corrections. Therefore, I want to thank Dr. E. Comay too.

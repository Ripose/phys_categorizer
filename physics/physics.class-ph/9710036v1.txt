We study the electromagnetic ﬁelds of an arbitrarily moving charged particle and the radiation
reaction on the charged particle using a novel approach. We ﬁrst show that the ﬁelds of an arbitrarily
moving charged particle in an inertial frame can be related in a simple manner to the ﬁelds of a
uniformly accelerated charged particle in its rest frame. Since the latter ﬁeld is static and easily
obtainable, it is possible to derive the ﬁelds of an arbitrarily moving charged particle by a coordinate
transformation. More importantly, this formalism allows us to calculate the self-force on a charged
particle in a remarkably simple manner. We show that the original expression for this force, obtained
by Dirac, can be rederived with much less computation and in an intuitively simple manner using
our formalism.

I. MOTIVATION

The ﬁeld of a charged particle at rest in an inertial frame is a static Coulomb ﬁeld which falls as (1/r2) in the
standard spherical coordinate system. The ﬁeld of a charge, moving with uniform velocity, can be obtained by
Lorentz transforming the Coulomb ﬁeld; this ﬁeld also falls as inverse square of the distance. The situation changes
dramatically for a charged particle which is moving with non zero acceleration. The ﬁeld now has a piece which
falls only as (1/r), usually called the radiation ﬁeld. For a ﬁeld which decreases as (1/r), the energy ﬂux varies as
(1/r2) implying that the same amount of energy ﬂows through spheres of diﬀerent radii at suﬃciently large distances
from the charge. Because of this reason, the radiation ﬁelds acquire a life of their own and the entire phenomena of
electromagnetic radiation hinges on this feature. Due to the continuous transfer of energy from the charged particle
to large distances, there will be a damping force acting on the charged particle which is usually called the radiation
reaction force. The derivation of radiation reaction force is conceptually and operationally quite complicated and the
expression — obtained originally by Dirac (see [4])— has no simple intuitive description.

We analyse these issues from a novel point of view in this paper which throws light on the conceptual and mathe-
matical issues involved in this problem. The analysis is motivated by the following issue: Maxwell’s equations are not
only Lorentz invariant but can also be written in a generally covariant manner. Given a charged particle moving in
some arbitrary trajectory, it is always possible to construct a proper coordinate system for such a charged particle. In
such a coordinate system, the charge will be at rest for all times but the background metric will be non Minkowskian
and – in general – time dependent. The Maxwell’s equations in this coordinate system will correspond to that of a
stationary charge located in a non trivial (and in general time dependent) metric. The solution to Maxwell’s equation
in this frame receives time dependent contributions not because of the motion of charged particles but because of
the non trivial nature of the background metric. But we know that, for internal consistency, these solutions should
transform to the standard solutions describing the ﬁeld of an arbitrarily moving charged particle when we go over
to the inertial frame! This is remarkable since the time dependence and nontriviality of the background metric have
to translate to the correct spatial and time dependence of the radiation ﬁeld. Further, the charged particle has to
feel the radiation reaction force in the non inertial frame, even though it is at rest, due to the non triviality of the
background metric. It is not intuitively obvious how these features come about and it is important to understand
how the physics in the non inertial frame of the charged particle operates.

We shall explore in this paper both the issues raised in the above paragraph. The key feature which emerges from
our analysis is the following. The structure of the Maxwell’s equations dictate that the static ﬁeld of a uniformly

accelerated charged particle in its rest frame can be related to the ﬁeld of an arbitrarily moving charged particle in the
inertial frame. This connection also carries over to the computation of the self-force. It turns out that the radiation
reaction force has a simple geometrical origin in the uniformly accelerating frame in which the charged particle is
instantaneously at rest. The force arises due to the deviation of the trajectory of the charged particle from that of
uniform acceleration and hence is proportional to the derivative of the acceleration. We shall now spell out the details
of the approach we plan to follow in this paper.

II. THE FORMALISM

Consider the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a charge moving with a uniform velocity in an inertial frame S. Since Maxwell’s
equations are Lorentz covariant, the most natural way to calculate the ﬁeld in S is to ﬁnd the ﬁeld in the charge’s
rest frame S′ and transform back to S. Let us next consider the problem of calculating the electromagnetic ﬁeld of
a charge which is moving arbitrarily. The conventional method (see e.g. [1]) is to calculate the Leinard - Weichert
potential and to diﬀerentiate it to obtain the ﬁeld. However, we will show that it is possible to approach the problem
diﬀerently along the following lines:

Consider a charge moving with an arbitrary velocity and acceleration in an inertial frame S. In the Lorentz gauge,

Maxwell’s equations can be written in terms of the vector potential Aµ and the current jµ as:

where 2 = ∂µ∂µ . It follows that:

2Aµ = 4πjµ

2F µν = 4π(∂µjν

∂νjµ)

−

(1)

(2)

Because of the characteristics of the 2 operator, the ﬁelds at an event P can only depend on the trajectory of the
charge at the retarded event O, which is the point of intersection of the backward light cone drawn from P , and the
worldline of the charge zµ = zµ(τ ). Since jµ is linear in four velocity, the quantity ∂µjν , in the the right hand side
of (2) can at most depend on ¨zµ(τ ). Therefore, the ﬁelds at P can at most depend on the second derivatives at the
retarted position of the charge at O - i.e., at most on the retarded acceleration of the charge. Suppose we now change
the trajectory of the charge to that of a uniformly accelerated one without changing the values of the velocity and
acceleration at the retarded event O. The ﬁeld at P , since it depends only on the velocity and acceleration at O will
still remain the same. It follows that, if we know the ﬁeld at P due to a uniformly accelerated charge with a given
acceleration and velocity at O, then we can obtain the ﬁeld due to a general trajectory.

Thus the problem reduces to that of calculating the ﬁeld of a uniformly accelerated charged particle. This is most
easily done by using the fact that Maxwell’s equations can be written in a generally covariant manner. Solving the
Maxwell’s equations in the noninertial, rest frame of charge and transforming the ﬁeld to the inertial frame, we can
obtain the ﬁeld of a uniformly accelerated particle. Using the argument outlined above, we can then ﬁnd the ﬁeld
of a charged particle moving in an arbitrary trajectory. To illustrate the power of this technique, we shall directly
calculate the ﬁeld for arbitrary, rectilinear motion. (The general case is a straightforward extension, and is treated in
Appendix C).

The real power of this formalism, however, lies in calculating the ﬁeld in the inﬁnitesimal neighbourhood of the
accelerating charge. The general expression for the ﬁeld in the neighbourhood of an accelerating charge, found by
Dirac, is a fairly involved expression, and good deal of labour is required to compute it. Our formalism involves
computing it in the instantaneous coaccelerating frame of the charge, in which the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the
position of the charge vanish. The only dynamical contribution to the near ﬁeld comes from the the third derivative,
which — as we shall see — leads to the radiation reaction term. This, along with the static terms, neatly transforms
into expression obtained by Dirac in the inertial frame.
In addition, a novel interpretation for radiation reaction
emerges in the accelerated frame.

The rest of the paper is organised as follows: In section 3, we obtain the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a uniformly
accelerated charge. This is done by solving Maxwell’s equations in the rest frame of the charged particle (which is
a noninertial frame) and transforming to the inertial frame. In section 4, we use this result to obtain the ﬁeld of an
arbitrarily moving charged particle. This result is obtained by the procedure outlined above. Section 5 uses the same
formalism to obtain the ﬁeld in the neighbourhood of the charged particle, thereby obtaining the radiation reaction
term. The last section summarises the results of the paper.

III. FIELDS DUE TO A CHARGE AT REST IN A UNIFORMLY ACCELERATED FRAME

A. The coordinate transformation

Since the key idea involves working with a uniformly accelerated frame, we shall review the coordinate transforma-

tion connecting the Minkowski frame to the Rindler frame and collect together the necessary formulas.

Consider a charge moving with uniform acceleration along the z-axis of an inertial frame S with the coordinate

system (t, x, y, z). The trajectory of the charge is given by:

where g is the proper acceleration of the charge, and τ is its proper time. The world line,

is a hyperbola. Referring to ﬁgure 1, one can see that this charge can inﬂuence regions A and B of spacetime, which
lie along the forward light cone of the charge’s trajectory but not the regions C and D. Let us now ﬁx a proper,
Fermi-Walker transported coordinate system (τ, ζ, x, y) to the accelerating charge and call it frame U . Separate
transformations are deﬁned from S to U for regions A and B. In region A, we take

(An alternative derivation of this solution is given in appendix A.) Also, as mentioned earlier, Ai=0 implying that
there are no magnetic ﬁelds.

Let us next compute the electric ﬁeld corresponding to this potential. In an inertial frame, F i

i, F i0, can all be
interpreted as deﬁning the electric ﬁeld (apart from diﬀerence in signs). However, in the metric deﬁned by equation
(7), these components have diﬀerent spatial dependence due to raising and lowering by gµν , which is not constant. So,
in order to deﬁne the physical electric ﬁeld, we go back to the basic deﬁnition of electric ﬁeld as the “electromagnetic
force per unit charge, experienced by a charge at rest”. The contravariant electromagnetic force vector is:

We shall now use this result to obtain the ﬁelds of an arbitrarily moving change.

IV. FIELD OF A CHARGE MOVING RECTILINEARLY, WITH ARBITRARY VELOCITY AND
ACCELERATION.

A. The coordinate transformation

We shall calculate the ﬁeld due to a rectilinearly moving charge using the approach described in section 2. Let
this charge move along the z-axis of the inertial frame S. We are interested in the ﬁeld at event P with coordinates
(t , z , ρ, φ). The retarded event is O with coordinates (t0, z0, 0, 0). At O, let vret be the velocity of the charge and aret
be its acceleration. Then, the proper acceleration is:

where γ = (1
frame M with coordinates (τ, ζ, ρ, φ) such that the origin of M coincides with the world line of the charge upto v µ
and aµ at the event O. So, at O, in the frame M , the charge is instantaneously at rest without acceleration. With
this construction, the constant, proper, acceleration of M is g, as deﬁned by equation (25).

Given these transformations and the form of the ﬁeld in the instantaneous Rindler frame, it is straight forward to
obtain the ﬁeld in the inertial frame. Conventionally, the latter ﬁelds are expressed in terms of the separation vector

This is the standard result for the electromagnetic ﬁeld of an arbitrary moving charged particle (see ref[1])

Our results in (45), (46) and (47) have been derived for the special case of a charge in rectilinear motion. This was
done to show clearly the use of our formalism. In fact, one can obtain the general result quite easily. Consider the
general case, in which the motion is not restricted to a straight line. Then, one can always transform to an inertial
frame of reference, S′′, in which the charge was at rest at the retarded event O. This requires us to make the usual
transformation to the accelerated frame:

This gives the ﬁeld in the Lorentz frame in which the charge has zero velocity at the retarded event. By making a
Lorentz transformation with an arbitrary velocity v, we can get ﬁelds in equations (48), (49). More formally, one can
show that the ﬁelds in (51) can be obtained from the following Lorentz invariant expression:

e

(Rσvσ)3 [(Rµvν −

Rνvµ) + RνRσ(vµaσ −

vσaµ)

RµRσ(vν aσ −

−

vσaν)]

Then, since this is a tensor equation under Lorentz transformations, it will give the ﬁelds in a frame S in which the
retarded velocity is arbitrary. A simple calculation shows that (52) reduces to (48) and (49) in this case. (This form
is derived in ref [3] in a very complicated manner. A simple derivation of (52) is given in Appendix C).

V. ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS IN THE INFINITESIMAL NEIGHBOURHOOD OF AN
ACCELERATING CHARGE

As before, let us consider a rectilinearly moving charge with arbitrary velocity and acceleration along the z-axis

with zero acceleration at the point ζ = ζ0 . We are interested in calculating the ﬁnite part of the force exerted on
the charge by it’s own ﬁeld at the event O. It is now convenient to use the coordinate Z introduced earlier with the
deﬁnition :

Z =

We will analyse the situation described in ﬁgure 2. The event O, at which the charge has zero velocity and
acceleration, corresponds to τ = 0. Consider now an event O′ along the worldline of the charge. The forward light ray
travelling from this event is seen to intersect the Z axis at the point P , which is an event simultaneous with event
O. We want to study the ﬁelds at P in the limit P
O and the ﬁelds at P are those due
to the charge in it’s own inﬁnitesimal neighbourhood. (Since the metric is noninertial, the curve O′P will not be a
straight line. But we are only interested in the limit of O′

O when the actual form of the curve is irrelevant).

→
The ﬁeld due to the retarded point O is a static ﬁeld, given by equation (54). However, we are interested in
calculating the ﬁeld at event P due to the event O′. At O′, the charge is not at rest in frame M . So, the ﬁeld given by
O′, we can make a correction to the ﬁeld given by equation (54),
equation (54) will not work. But, in the limit O
which can account for it’s motion at event O′. To illustrate this, let us approach the inﬁnitesimal neighbourhood of
the charge along the Z axis. If we ignore for the moment the motion of the charge then the ﬁeld along the Z axis at

terms are already divergent. We would have landed up with these three terms, even if we had not accounted for the
motion of the charge at event O′. It is the third term, which has the derivative of the acceleration, which is the most
interesting term. We have been able to obtain it because we accounted for the motion of the charge at event O′. It
is this term which accounts for the eﬀect of radiation reaction on the charge.

Computing the above expression for f µ in the inertial frame is a laborious task. Our formalism makes the corre-
sponding computation very simple. In fact, we calculated it the same way we calculated the ﬁelds: We transform
to an inertial frame S′′, in which the charge is at rest at the retarded event and ﬁnd the expression for the force
in the comoving accelerating frame, which is given by equation (65). By transforming back to S′′ and making an
arbitrary Lorentz transformation to S gives the force (66) in the general inertial frame starting from (65). (We give
the explicit procedure in Appendix B.) Here we shall transform only the radiation reaction term, and show that it
gives the correct radiation reaction in the inertial frame, for the case of rectilinear motion.

Let f z denote the radiation reaction force in the inertial frame S. Then, if Frad

An attempt is made in ref [2] to relate the radiated power to the force acting between the charge and the ﬁcticious
charge density at the horizon. Our result is more general and gives the actual radiation reaction force itself. Further

VI. CONCLUSIONS:

The radiation of electromagnetic waves by a charged particle and the consequent radiation reaction force are issues
of considerable theoretical signiﬁcance and have attracted the attention of researchers over decades. We believe that
the approach outlined in this paper throws light on these processes and clariﬁes the conceptual issues involved in
the problem. To begin with, we have been able to derive the radiation ﬁeld as arising out of a static Coulomb ﬁeld
in a non inertial frame through a general coordinate transformation. This is of some conceptual importance since
one believes that physics should be independent of the coordinate system. Secondly, we have been able to show that
the key contribution to radiation reaction arises because of the deviation of the trajectory from that of a uniformly
accelerated one. This deviation, which essentially modiﬁes the expression Rµvµ, has a purely geometrical origin
in the locally co-accelerating frame. Since the lowest order deviation will be proportional to the rate of change of
acceleration, it is clear that the radiation reaction force should be proportional to the same; that is, it should be
proportional to the third derivative of the trajectory.

It will be of interest to see whether these results allow us to tackle the question of self-force in curved space time
and to generalize the various expressions to an arbitrary curved background. We hope to address these questions in
a future publication.

A. Solution to Maxwell’s Equations for a charge at rest in a uniformly accelerating frame

We shall ﬁnd a solution to this equation by studying a diﬀerent, but related problem.

Consider the problem of a charge placed at rest outside the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. In the spherical

polar coordinates (r , θ, φ), the charge is placed at r = r ′, θ = 0 . The metric is given by:

Now, if the charge is placed inﬁnitesimally close to the horizon and all measurements made in an arbitrarily small
region around the charge, then the horizon would appear “ﬂat”. Mathematically, if we introduce a coordinate ζ by:

then we can write

r = 2M + ζ ; 2M

where g = (1 /4M ) is the eﬀective surface gravity of the horizon. If we ﬁx our origin at θ = 0 , r ∼= 2M and restrict
all observations perpendicular to the z-axis to a very small region, then ρ ∼= 2M sin θ ∼= 2M θ. In this limit,

which is identical to the metric given by equation (7) .

In this approximation, we are neglecting curvature of spacetime such that the horizon appears like a plane (ζ = 0)
as in a uniformly accelerating frame. More importantly, it gives us an ansatz to ﬁnd a solution to equation (13), by
using this approximation in the expression for A0 given by equation (84) . Straightforward algebra gives:

Consider a charge moving in an arbitrary trajectory in an inertial frame S. As before, we construct a comoving,
uniformly accelerating frame M , in which the expression for the self-force is given by (65). Consider now the expression
(66) in a frame in which

The expression reduces to

use (69) with τ0 = 0. If one wants the expression for f µ in the frame S, all one has to do is ﬁnd the expression in M
(which is a simpler task compared to directly calculating it in the frame S, as is normally done), given by equation
(65), transform it to the inertial frame (to get expression (84)), and ﬁnally to transform it to S by making a Lorentz
transformation. This leads to the Lorentz-Dirac expression, given by equation (66).

C. Covariant form of the ﬁeld of an arbitrarily moving charge:

It is possible to express the ﬁeld tensor F µν produced by an arbitrarily moving charge, ina manifestedly Lorentz
invariant form. Though the result is obtained in ref.3, the derivation is quite cumbersome. We give here a clearer and
simpler derivation of this formula. Maxwell’s equations in inertial coordinates in ﬂat spacetime are:

Combined together in the Lorentz gauge (∂µAµ)=0, we have:

∂µF µν = 4πjν; F µν = ∂µAν −

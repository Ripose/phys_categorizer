Abstract

We assess Coarse Graining by studying diﬀerent partitions of the phase
space of the Baker transformation and the periodic torus automorphisms. It
turns out that the shape of autocorrelation functions for the Baker transfor-
mation is more or less reproduced. However, for certain partitions the decay
rates turn out to be irrelevant, even decay may stop in a ﬁnite time. For the
periodic torus automorphisms, Coarse Graining introduces artiﬁcial dumping.

1 Introduction

Coarse graining is a simple way to explain the manifest irreversibility from the

underlying entropy preserving dynamical laws. The idea which goes back to Ehren-

fests [1], see also Tolman [2], is that ﬁne measurements at the fundamental level are

unattainable, therefore we can and should observe only averages over microstates.

The averaging is introduced by the observer in addition to the dynamical evolution.

The resulting loss of information gives rise to entropy increase.

In fact all other

conventional explanations of irreversibility are inventions of extra-dynamical mech-

anisms to lose dynamical information. Boltzmann’s Stossalanzats [1, 3] amounts to

loss of postcollisional correlations, von Neumann’s [4] measurement projection pos-

tulate amounts to loss of quantum correlations described by the oﬀ-diagonal matrix

elements of the representation of the pure state in terms of a basis of common eigen-

vectors of a complete system of commuting observables, resulting in the collapse of

the wave function. Decoherence amounts to loss of information through transfer to

an unknown and uncontrollable environment [5].

We shall not discuss here the details of these approaches which involve assump-

tions additional to the dynamical evolution of a more or less subjectivistic charac-

ter. For a recent discussion see for example [6]. In contradistinction Prigogine and

coworkers have stressed [7, 8, 9] that irreversibility should be an intrinsic property of

dynamical systems which admit time asymmetric representations of evolution, with-

out any loss of information. These time asymmetric representations can be obtained

by extending the evolution to suitable Rigged Hilbert Space or by intertwining the

evolution with Markov processes. These intrinsically irreversible systems include

for example Large Poincar´e Non-Integrable systems and chaotic systems. We shall

not discuss further these interesting direction of research. Our objective is to see

how coarse graining works for simple systems where calculations are controllable

2

and then draw more general conclusions. In Section 2 we deﬁne the coarse graining

projections and the coarse grained evolution. We study coarse graining projection

of the Baker transformation in Section 3 and of the periodic torus automorphisms

in Section 4.

2 Coarse graining projections

We introduce the basic concepts and notations that will later be used in the de-

scription of particular systems. Let us consider the conﬁguration space X with the

measure µ. The partition ζ is the ﬁnite set

Zk}

{

M
k=1 of the cells Zk which satisfy the

following properties:

M
k=1 Zk = X,

µ(Zi
S

Zk) = δikµ(Zi),

where δik is the Kroneker symbol.

T

Coarse graining is implemented through the averaging projection over the cells

of the partition ζ known also in probability theory [10, 11] as the conditional expec-

tation operator P over ζ:

M

P f (x) =

fk 1Zk(x).

Xk=1
Here 1Zk(x) is the indicator of the set Zk:

(1)

(2)

and the average value fk of the function f (x) in the cell Zk is

Let us deﬁne by Q the orthocomplement of P :

dµ(x)f (x).

P + Q = I.

Q projects onto the ﬁne/detail information eliminated by P . The simplest dynamics

are cascades of automorphisms S of the phase space X. The observables are usually

square integrable phase functions in L2(X) and they evolve according to the iterated

Koopman operator

V : L2(X)

L2(X)

such that V f (x) = f (Sx).

→

The coarse grained evolution is described by the projected evolution by P (2):

P = (P V P )n, n = 0, 1, 2 . . . .
V n

In general however

V P = P V P + QV P.

(3)

(4)

Therefore starting with a coarse grained observable P f , the evolution may regen-

erate the ﬁne detail QV P f , which is eliminated by the repeated application of the

projection P . Therefore arbitrary projections P destroy the dynamical evolution. In

fact as the Koopman operators of chaotic systems are shifts [12], their coarse grained

projections can be whatever contractive evolution one wishes (Structure theorem of

bounded operators) [12, 13] with any desired decay rates. A condition which guar-

antees the reliability of the coarse grained description is that the evolution V should

not destroy the cells of the coarse graining partition. In this way minimal dynamical

information is lost by averaging and the resulting symbolic dynamics is very close

to the original evolution. Such coarse-graining projections compatible with the dy-

namics should be distinguished from arbitrary coarse grainings because they are not

imposed by the external observer but are intrinsic properties of the system. To our

knowledge only three types of such intrinsic coarse grainings have been proposed.

Namely, projections onto the K-partition [7, 14], onto the generating partition [15]

of Kolmogorov dynamical systems and onto Markov partitions [16].

We shall not discuss further this interesting subject related also to the symbolic

representation of dynamics [17] but consider arbitrary coarse grainings as so far no

knowledge.

The inﬂuence of the coarse graining to the approach to equilibrium will be studied

through the decay rates of the autocorrelation functions of the observable phase

The coarse grained autocorrelation function C (n)

X(P f (x))2dµ(x)

.

However, in the following we shall see that the autocorrelation functions are not

sensitive enough to discriminate results of diﬀerent approaches. In order to analyze

a system in more detail, we introduce the decay rate τ (n) at time (stage) n:

τ (n)(f ) =

log

−

C (n+1)(f )
C (n)(f )

C (n)(f )
−
C (n−1)(f )

.

−

This deﬁnition is motivated by the following observation.

If the autocorrelation

function decreases (or increases) monotonically at the points n

1, n, n + 1, it can

−

be written as

C (n) = A(n) + B(n) exp(

κ(n)n)

−

at these points. In this case the decay rate is τ (n) = κ(n). As we can usually expect

that the representation (8) is the leading term of the asymptotics for suﬃciently large

n and that A(n), B(n), and κ(n) become independent of n for large n, the decay

rate τ (n) converges to the decay rate of the system κ(

). Physically speaking, in

∞

most cases one needs information about the widths and the lifetimes of the system,

i.e. τ (n), rather than just the decaying proﬁle C (n).

3 Coarse graining the Baker transformation

We shall apply the coarse graining to the Baker transformation deﬁned [18] on the

torus [0, 1]

[0, 1] by the formula

(9)

In order to study the applicability of the coarse graining for this transformation, we

introduce two diﬀerent partitions ζ s and ζ t such that µ(Z s

i ) = µ(Z t

j) for all i, j. As

these partitions have cells of the same measure, the role of geometry is manifested

in the clearest way. It is worth noticing here that we cannot use for this study an

one-dimensional map as we cannot choose two diﬀerent partitions with the same

measure in one dimension. In Fig. 1, we present both partitions for the number of

the cells in each direction M = 4.

The calculation of autocorrelation functions (5,6) involves integration over each

cell. The numerical realization of this integration results in loss of accuracy. To

avoid this problem, we use the fact that the function f (n) = (P BP )nf is piece-wise

constant for n

1. For such functions, the successive iterations can be written as

≥

f (n+1)
k

=

B(Zi)).

\

(10)

It is worth noticing that the latter representation is rather eﬀective from the com-

putational point of view as the sum in Eq. (10) involves very few terms. The only

remaining integration in Eq. (6) is the calculation of P f . We use the rectangular

quadrature formula for this integration. The numerical investigation shows that the

number of integration points 40 by 40 for each cell is enough to reach the conver-

gence.

the initial function

Now, after the description of the method, we present the results. We start with

f (x, y) = x + y.

With this particular choice, it is possible to calculate the autocorrelation function

explicitly. A straightforward analytical calculation gives:

C (n) =

(1 +

n2−n +

2−n).

It is interesting to point out that the second term in expression (11) corresponds to

the Jordan block of the second order in the generalized spectral decomposition [19].

With expression (11), the decay rate can be obtained exactly:

The exact expressions (11,12) are used for the comparison with the coarse graining

results.

The autocorrelation function and the local decay rates for both partitions with

M = 200, and analytical results are presented in Fig. 2. The ﬁrst conclusion we can

make here is that coarse graining reproduces the correlation function with accuracy

better than 10−4. Hence, if one is interested only in similar integral characteristics,

coarse graining can be used.

However, in many cases one needs more detailed characteristics of the evolution,

for example the decay rates. Here the situation is changed as diﬀerent partitions

result in signiﬁcantly diﬀerent decay rates. While in this particular case the square

partition ζ s produces results that are surprisingly close to the exact ones, the results

for the triangle partition ζ t diﬀer drastically although they agree up to 11 iterations.

The decay rates for the partitions with M = 800 are presented in Fig. 3. For these

partitions the results agree very well in a wider region, up to about 20 iterations.

However, further iterations again show huge disagreement between the results for

the triangle partition and the exact results.

The square partitions may also give irrelevant results. Namely, if we consider

the rectangle partitions with 2N subdivisions of the x axis and 2M subdivisions of

7

the y axis, than after N + M

1 iterations the coarse grained correlation function

−

reaches equilibrium exactly. Hence, there is no decay after this number of stages.

This statement is also true for the square partition when N = M. However, there

exists rectangle partition with the same cell area that results in the proper decay

curve. We illustrate this discussion in Fig. 4. Therefore the decay rates are very

sensitive to the choice of the type of the partition.

One may expect that despite the big variations of the decay rates, an average of

them might be stable. To analyze this possibility, we present in Fig. 5 the average

decay rates

τ (n)
av =

1
10

n+10

Xi=n+1

τ (i)

for n = 10 and n = 20. However also in this case the previous conclusions remain

valid: while the square partition produces decay rates robust with respect to changes

of the cell area, the triangle partition gives results which change irregularly with

respect to changes of the cell area. However, the average decay rate τ (10)

for the

av

triangle partition is stabilized when M is rather big. But we cannot restrict ourselves

to this small number of iterations (n

10) as the decay rates reach their asymptotics

∼

much later. The results for the ζ s show this clearly as the diﬀerence of τ (10)

and

av

τ (20)
av

is rather pronounced.

We have already mentioned that our results do not depend on the choice of the

observable function f (x, y). To illustrate this, we present in Fig. 6 the autocorre-

lation function and the local decay rates for both partitions with M = 800, and

the initial function f (x, y) = x√x + y. Analytical results are not available for this

function. One can see that the results have the same qualitative behavior as previ-

ous ones. Calculations for other initial functions also give the similar results, so our

conclusions are valid and independent of the initial function.

4 Coarse graining the periodic torus automorphisms

In the previous section we discussed coarse graining applied for the Baker transfor-

mation. One could see that, despite the problems with the decay rates, the method

reproduces the autocorrelation functions rather well. Here we shall show that this

is not always the case, and coarse graining applied to some dynamical systems may

produce even qualitatively wrong autocorrelation functions.

Let us consider the periodic automorphisms T of the torus [0, 1]

[0, 1]:

×

T

 

x
y !

=

 

(T11x + T12y) mod 1
(T21x + T22y) mod 1 !

.

The coeﬃcients Tij are integers with the property

T k = I

for some k

N.

∈

(13)

There exist few families of periodic torus automorphisms T with only possible

periods k = 2, 3, 4, and 6 (Appendix 1). As described in the previous section, we

construct the autocorrelation functions (5,6). Due to the periodicity of the transfor-

mation T , the exact autocorrelation function is also periodic. However, the coarse

grained autocorrelation functions may show damping as a result of information loss.

We present two such examples in Fig. 7 . For the transformation

we used the partition ζ s with M = 20. This type of the partition gives reasonable

results for the Baker transformation. Here, however, one can see that the auto-

correlation function approaches equilibrium as if there was damping. Hence, the

periodicity is not preserved. Moreover, for the simple transformation

T =

−

there exist also partitions giving rise to damping. As an example, we plot in Fig. 7

the autocorrelation function for the rectangle partition with 5 subdivisions for the

x axis and 7 subdivisions for the y axis.

5 Conclusions

For the Baker transformation, coarse graining reproduces the shape of the auto-

correlation functions (Figs. 2,6), but decay rates are hardly reproduced (Figs. 2-6).

Moreover, some partitions like in Fig. 4 give rise to exact approach of equilibrium

after a ﬁnite time while others may give the correct asymptotic behaviour. For the

periodic torus automorphisms, coarse graining introduces artiﬁcial damping of the

autocorrelation functions.

The above mentioned conclusions illustrate once more the subjectivistic charac-

ter of coarse graining. Therefore when employed, coarse graining should be chosen

with care, for example by selecting partitions intrinsic to the dynamics, as discussed

at the end of section 2.

In fact the answer to the inverse problem of statistical

physics is [15] that all stationary Markov processes arise as exact projections onto

the generating partitions of Kolmogorov dynamical systems, in the spirit of Misra-

Prigigine-Courbage theory of irreversibility [7, 14]. In fact such intrinsic partitions

are not deﬁned by any observations but they are objective properties of the dynam-

ical evolution.

Concerning the general issue of irreversibility, the possibilities opened by extend-

ing the dynamical evolution or by intertwining the dynamical evolution with Markov

processes [7, 8, 9] are a challenging physical and mathematical research direction.

abstract

Using the photonic analogue of the Korringa-Kohn-Rostocker (KKR) method, the spectrum of electroma-
gnetic waves in a three-dimensional fcc lattice of homogeneous dielectric spheres with various dielectric
contrast is analyzed. We conﬁrm the main features of the spectrum obtained by the plane wave method,
namely that for a suﬃciently high dielectric contrast a full gap opens in the spectrum between the eights
and ninth bands if the dielectric constant εs of spheres is lower than the dielectric constant εb of the
background medium. If εs > εb, no gap is found in the spectrum. The lowest dielectric contrast εb/εs for
which a full gap opens in the spectrum is around 8.13. The maximal value of the relative band-gap width
approaches 14% in the close-packed case and decreases monotonically as the ﬁlling fraction decreases.

Introduction

Under certain conditions, a gap can open in the spectrum of electromagnetic waves in a dielectric medium,

independent of the direction of their propagation [1, 2]. Dielectric structures possessing such a photonic

band gap are promising candidates for various technological applications [1]. Moreover, such structures

oﬀer a new laboratory to study various atomic processes.

Indeed, if a gap opens in the spectrum of

electromagnetic waves, all parameters and characteristics of atom placed in such a medium, such as, for

example, atomic radius and its spontaneous emission rates are expected to change.

In order to open such a gap, one considers Maxwell’s equations in a dielectric with a spatially periodic

dielectric function, in full analogy to the Schr¨odinger equation with a periodic potential [2]. In the latter

case, the spectrum can be classiﬁed according to the Bloch momentum k. Energy (frequency) levels νn

are continuous functions of the Bloch momentum k in the (ﬁrst) Brillouin zone. We say that there is
a full gap, or simply a gap between the nth and (n + 1)th levels when νn+1(k) > νn(k′) for all k and
k′. We say that there is a direct gap between the nth and (n + 1)th levels when νn+1(k) > νn(k) for

all k. For the Schr¨odinger equation in one space dimension, the number of gaps is in general inﬁnite

and the only periodic potential which does not open any gap in the spectrum is a constant potential [3].

However, the situation changes dramatically in two and higher dimensions. One can prove rigorously that

the number of gaps in the spectrum can only be ﬁnite and, if the potential is not strong enough, no gap

opens in the spectrum [4]. If electromagnetic waves are considered, opening a gap in the spectrum is even

more diﬃcult and it took several years of intensive search to achieve it experimentally for microwaves [5].

Note that Maxwell’s equations enjoy scale invariance so that, in principle, by scaling all sizes of a given

structure one can shift a gap theoretically to whatever frequency range.

So far, the plane-wave method [6, 7, 8] has been the main tool to calculate the spectrum of electromag-

netic waves in three-dimensional dielectric lattices. However, the plane-wave method is numerically rather

unstable for a setup considered in experiment, namely when the dielectric function is piece-wise constant

and changes discontinuously [5, 9, 10]. The main culprit for this behaviour is the Gibbs instability - the

dielectric constant is poorly estimated near its spatial discontinuities by a truncated Fourier series which

wildly oscillates even if more than one thousand of plane waves is retained (see, for example, Fig. 2 of

[8]). Also, the plane wave expansion become impractical if the dielectric constant exhibits a large imag-

inary part. Another approach to calculate the spectrum of electromagnetic waves in three-dimensional

dielectric lattices uses a discretization of Maxwell’s equation inside the primitive cell of the lattice [12].

However, both methods are diﬃcult to apply in the presence of impurities and to the calculation of

1

Green’s function.

In order to have a universal method which can deal with problems of the behaviour of electromagnetic

waves in a periodic dielectric medium in their full complexity, we have developed and employed a photonic

analogue of the Korringa-Kohn-Rostocker (KKR) method [13]. The KKR method [14] is based on the ﬁrst

principle multiple-scattering theory (MST). It uses explicitly scattering matrices and Green’s function

which are expanded in the basis of spherical harmonics and the spectrum is determined by zeroes of a

determinant. For electrons on a Bravais lattice, inclusion of spherical waves with angular momentum up

to lmax = 2 already gives result within a few per cent of the exact calculation [14]. Expansion in the

basis of spherical harmonics does not mean that scatterers have to be spherically symmetric. Indeed,

scatterers of arbitrary shape are allowed in which case scattering matrices are simply nondiagonal in the

angular momentum indices [16]. The main advantage of the KKR method is that it gives directly the

total Green’s function from which the density of states (DOS) and the so-called local density of states

can be easily extracted. The local DOS, which is proportional to the imaginary part of the total Green’s

function at the coinciding points in the coordinate space, is an important quantity which determines

decay of excited states of atoms embedded in the lattice [15]. Also, the frequency dependence of the

dielectric constant can be easily implemented in the formalism.

2 Face-centered cubic lattice of dielectric spheres

In the following, we shall present the results of our numerical calculation for a face-centered cubic (fcc)

lattice of dielectric spheres with a single sphere per lattice primitive cell. This case is very interesting from

the experimental point of view, since such dielectric lattices form when silicon matrices, synthetic opals,

and collodial crystals are used [9, 10, 11]. Some of the structures were shown to exhibit the so-called stop

gap (gap in the spectrum at a ﬁxed direction of the incident light) at optical frequencies [9, 10] and are

the natural candidates to achieve a full photonic band gap [10].

At the same time, the case of fcc lattice of dielectric spheres has been controversial since the ﬁrst

experimental results were published [17]. Results for a sample consisting from polycrystalline Al2O3

spheres, 6mm in diameter with a microwave refractive index of 3.06 in thermal-compression-molded

dielectric foam of refractive index 1.01 indicated the presence of a “photonic band gap” in the microwave

regime [17]. However, subsequent numerical calculations using the plane wave method [6, 7] claimed that

no gap opens in the spectrum and only a pseudo-gap (a sharp drop in the DOS) exists [6]. Nevertheless,

two years later using the plane-wave method, S¨oz¨uer, Haus, and Inguva [8] did ﬁnd a full gap for the fcc

2

lattice of dielectric spheres between the eights and ninth bands. The discrepancy between the results of

[6, 7] and [8] follows from the fact that unlike to the case of electrons, a gap for electromagnetic waves

opens in an intermediate region and the authors of [6, 7] stopped their calculation just beneath that

region (see Fig. 1 in [6, 7]).

The latter deserves some discussion. In the case of electrons, the formation of bands results from

the broadening of individual atomic levels when the atoms start to feel the presence of each other. The

largest gap between atomic levels is between the lowest-lying energy levels. Therefore, for a lattice of

atoms, one expects to ﬁnd a gap essentially between the ﬁrst and the second energy band with the gap

between higher bands scaling down to zero [3]. However, for electromagnetic waves a gap does not open

between the lowest lying bands but in an intermediate region. This phenomenon can be rather easily

understood, since for a dielectric scatterer and Maxwell’s equations bound states are absent. They are

replaced by resonances and the above argument for locating the position of a band gap no longer holds.

Moreover, if the wavelength is small compared to the size of the spheres, one can use geometric optics

while in the opposite limit of long wavelengths, the Rayleigh approximation applies. In neither case a gap

opens in the spectrum. Therefore, if a gap is present in the spectrum, it should be in the intermediate

region between the two limiting cases (see, however, the case of a diamond lattice ([7], Fig. 2), which is

a complex lattice). The very same is also expected to apply for the localization of light [2, 18].

2.1 Results

S¨oz¨uer, Haus, and Inguva [8] were well aware of the convergence problems of the plane-wave method and

they called for the recalculation and conﬁrmation of their results by a more precise method. The latter

constitutes the ﬁrst part of our results. Using the photonic KKR method, we were able to conﬁrm the

plane-wave method result [8] that, in the case of air spheres and for a suﬃciently high dielectric contrast

• a full gap opens between the eights and ninth bands

• a direct gap opens between the ﬁfth and sixth bands.

If the dielectric constant of spheres is larger than that of a background medium, no gap opens in the

spectrum. This situation is realized, for example, if dielectric spheres in air are considered. We did not

ﬁnd any compelling explanation for this behaviour. In general, the higher frequency the higher lmax is

to be taken. Taking lmax = 1 is suﬃcient to account for the linear part of the band structure around

the Γ point. The intermediate region requires then lmax = 3 − 5 and lmax = 6 is needed to ensure good

convergence in the range considered.

3

In Figs. 1 and 2 we present our results for a three-dimensional close-packed fcc lattice of air spheres

in a dielectric medium with the dielectric constant εb = 9. We choose this conﬁguration for two reasons.

First, it is suﬃciently representative to show the presence of a full gap in the spectrum, and secondly, the

value of the background dielectric constant εb = 9 is close to that of rutile (TiO2) at optical frequencies

which is used in experiments. Fig. 1 shows the band structure. Frequency ν is plotted in scale-invariant

units c/πA, where A is the lattice constant1 and c is the speed of light in the vacuum.

Only a single gap with a middle of gap frequency ν = 2.796 ± 0.002 and the width △ν = 0.044 ± 0.004

opens in the spectrum in the range considered. The error is determined from the convergence properties

of the KKR method. In the close-packed case, the lower gap boundary takes on its maximal value at the

W point of the Brillouin zone while the upper gap boundary takes on its minimal value at the X point,

in agreement with the plane-wave calculations (see [20] for the classiﬁcation of special points of three-

dimensional lattices). In general, the photonic bands show much more branching than the electronic bands

and the actual classiﬁcation of diﬀerent bands can be quite involved. Group-theoretical classiﬁcation of

eigenmodes in three-dimensional photonic lattices is discussed in [21].

The presence of the gap in the εb = 9, εs = 1 case is also transparent from the calculation of the

DOS per primitive unit cell. The latter was calculated using the Monkhorst-Park integration scheme [22].

Integration over the Brillouin zone started from a mesh of 12 × 12 × 12 uniformly spaced points, which

was subsequently reduced to 182 points with calculated weigths using the symmetries of the lattice. The

resulting DOS per primitive cell is plotted in Fig. 2.

Fig. 3 shows the band structure for a close-packed fcc lattice of air spheres in a dielectric medium with

the dielectric constant εb = 2.1609 (nb = 1.47). The latter case corresponds to the experimental setup of

[9] and is also close to that of [10]. Our calculation shows no gap in the spectrum. Only stop gaps are

present. In agreement with the experimental observation, the most pronounced stop gap is seen between

ﬁrst bands at the L point of the Brillouin zone. For comparison with experiment, in Tab. I we give the

width △νL of the stop gap at the L point and the eﬀective refractive index neff for a close-packed fcc

lattice of air spheres in background media with nb = 1.33, 1.37, 1.47, and 1.6 used in recent experiments

[9, 10], together with the case nb = 3 for which the band structure was calculated (see Fig. 1).

From the experimental point of view, it is interesting to know what is the threshold dielectric contrast

εmax/εmin, where εmax (εmin) is bigger (smaller) of the εs and εb, for which a full gap opens in the spectrum.

Obviously, this threshold value changes with the radius of spheres and also depends on whether the

dielectric constant of spheres is larger or smaller than that of the background medium. The precise value

of the threshold dielectric contrast has been out of reach of the plane-wave calculations [8]. Using the

photonic KKR method, we scanned diﬀerent conﬁgurations between the X and W points of the Brillouin

zone. For close-packed air spheres, the lower and upper bounds of the full gap are set at the W and

X points, respectively. For smaller ﬁlling fractions, already at f = 0.70, and close to the threshold

dielectric contrast, the gap width is completely determined by the band structure at the W point. We

determined the lowest threshold dielectric contrast εb/εs for an fcc lattice of dielectric spheres to be

8.126 ± 0.002 (εr = 1.096 and Ψ = −0.918 in this case). This can for example be realized for the case

of close-packed air spheres in a background dielectric medium with the dielectric constant εb = 8.126. In

all other cases, i.e., if the radius of spheres is lowered, the threshold dielectric contrast is higher. The

threshold dielectric constrast obtained by the photonic KKR method implies the threshold refractive

index constrast 2.8506 ± 0.0004 which is signiﬁcantly higher than the early theoretical estimate 1.21 by

Yablonovitch [1] and 1.46 by John [2].

The plot of the relative gap width, which is the gap width divided by the midgap frequency, as a func-

tion of the the refractive index contrast for diﬀerent ﬁlling fractions is presented in Fig. 4. The maximal

value of the relative gap width approaches 14% in the close-packed case and decreases monotonically as

the ﬁlling fraction decreases. The relative gap width as a function of the refractive index contrast shows

a rapid saturation. For example, in the close-packed case the relative gap width at 5.48 is already 80%

in the lattice primitive cell, and lattices of scatteres of general shape will be published elsewhere.

of its maximal value.

3 Conclusions

Using the photonic KKR method, we have calculated the photonic band structure for a three-dimensional

fcc lattice of homogeneous spheres. To obtain a good convergence in the frequency range considered, it

was suﬃcient to retain multipole ﬁelds with the angular momentum up to lmax = 6. We conﬁrmed the

main features of the spectrum obtained by the plane wave method [8], i.e., for a suﬃciently high dielectric

contrast a full gap opens between the eights and ninth bands, a direct gap opens between the ﬁfth and

sixth bands, and no gap opens in the spectrum if εb < εs.

For close-packed air spheres, the lower and upper bounds of the full gap are set at the W and X

points, respectively. For ﬁlling fractions less than 0.7 and close to the threshold dielectric contrast for

6

which a full gap opens in the spectrum, the gap width is completely determined at the W point. The

lowest dielectric contrast εb/εs for which a full gap opens in the spectrum is found to be 8.126 ± 0.002

which occurs for a close-packed fcc lattice. The maximal value of the relative gap width approaches 14%

in the close-packed case and decreases monotonically as the ﬁlling fraction decreases. The maximal value

of the relative gap width calculated by the KKR method is comparable to that calculated by the plane

waves (cf. Fig. 8 of [8]).

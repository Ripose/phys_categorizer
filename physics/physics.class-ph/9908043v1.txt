Zero-energy solutions of Maxwell’s equations have been discovered and

re-discovered many times in this century. In this comment we show that the

paper by A. E. Chubykalo (which, in fact, also comments on the recent papers)

did not explain physical interpretation of this solution and it used doubtful

(up-to-date) postulates. Diﬀerent explanations of the considered problem are

possible.

The dynamical free-space Maxwell equations can be written in the form

∇ × [E − iB] + i(∂/∂t)[E − iB] = 0 ,

∇ × [E + iB] − i(∂/∂t)[E + iB] = 0 .

(cf., e.g., formulas (4.19)-(4.22) in ref. [1]). The paper [2] begins with the statement that

this set support non-trivial solutions with energy p0 = ±|p| and p0 = 0, and refers in this

connection to the works [3,6], where the equations (1) have been written for 3-vectors φL,R(p)

as opposed to the ﬁelds in (1a,b).1 Then, trying to explain the negative-energy and zero-

energy solutions Chubykalo obtained a new form of the energy density of the electromagnetic

ﬁeld [2, Eq.(28)]. It is based on his instantaneous-action-at-a-distance electrodynamics which

includes implicit dependence of the ﬁelds on time.

In the present note we analyze his work and show that it does not contain sound physical

explanation. The main postulate is also required solid experimental and mathematical basis.

Nevertheless, we agree that the question of non-transverse solutions [8,10,13–17] requires

further research.

First of all, I want to mention that the so-called Oppenheimer-Ahluwalia E = 0 solutions2

was discovered by many researchers, whose works [3–8] should be paid credits to.3,4 They

have been analyzed further in [9,10,12].5 A solution of the similar nature in two-particle

system was also considered, see, for example, ref. [11].

A. Chubykalo [2] considers Landau and Lifshitz [18, §31] derivation of the Poynting

theorem in the Section I. He objects it on the basis that it does not provide zero energy

(negative-energies as well) unless the ﬁelds E and B are equal to zero. Furthermore, in

the Landau-Lifshitz procedure “one implicitly neglects a radiation ﬁeld which can go oﬀ to

inﬁnity” (in the opinion of the author of [2]).6 Chubykalo then divides the electromagnetic

2Here we use the terminology of the commented paper.

3Beforehand, I apologize before those discoverers of the non-transverse solutions of the Maxwell’s

equations whom I did not mention here. I am sure that a lot of papers remains unnoticed.

4Very unfortunately, neither Ahluwalia (the ﬁrst papers are in ref. [6]) nor Chubykalo papers

contain suﬃcient list of references.

I informed Dr. Ahluwalia about previous related works as

earlier as in 1994-95.

unbounded.

5These papers proved that E = 0 solution is not a varying solution in time and it may be

6Indeed, authors of diﬀerent textbooks on classical/quantum electrodynamics (e. g., ref. [22,

p.105]) also assumed the postulate that the ﬁelds, their derivatives and Lagrangian, all tend to

ﬁelds into two parts (which depend on time explicitly and implicitly), writes corresponding

Maxwell’s equations7 and, in fact, he postulates that some part of the total electromagnetic

ﬁeld (E∗ and H∗ in the notation of [2] to be precise) does not vanish at the spatial inﬁnity!

See the formula (26) therein. In such a way he re-normalizes the energy density subtracting
the quantity E∗ 2+H∗ 2

from the energy density used by Landau et al., see formulas (25)-(28)

in [2]. The Chubykalo ﬁnal result for energy density ω is

The main problem with the Chubykalo derivation is the following: the integrals are diver-

gent when they extend over all the space. This refers to the ﬁrst term of (25), the integrals

in (26) and the dot products in the numerator of the ﬁrst term of (27). This is easily proven

on observing that if E∗ and H∗ do not tend to zero at inﬁnity, they have the asymptotic

behavior of O(rα), α ≥ 0. In the mean time, E0 (for instance) refers to Coulomb (Coulomb-

like) electromagnetic ﬁeld and, thus, has the asymptotic behavior O(1/r2). The factor r2 in

the volume element cancels 1/r2, leading to the total asymptotic of the integrated expres-

sion O(1), r → ∞ in the better case. I am not going to discuss the mathematical validity

of subtracting inﬁnite expressions in this case, leaving this problem to specialists. But, to

the best of my knowledge, some persons claimed that such procedures do not have sound

mathematical foundation [21]. Furthermore, even if one accepts its validity the total energy

resulting from integration of (28) over the whole space is to be inﬁnite!? It was noted by

Barut [22, p.105] that in the case of non-vanishing ﬁelds at the spatial inﬁnity we cannot

zero at spatial inﬁnity.

7In my opinion, equations (20,21) of ref. [2] are just another form of the Maxwell equations for this

particular case, in the sense that there is no new physical content if one expects that the Maxwell

electrodynamics describes also the Coulomb interaction. Brownstein in [19] showed that, in fact,

confusions sometimes arise when physicists use the same symbol ∂/∂xµ for both partial and total

derivative. Unfortunately, Brownstein did not cite the previous works on the subject [20].

expect to ﬁnd globally conserved quantities.

In the mean time, the deﬁnitional problems of the 4-momentum of the electromag-

netic ﬁeld and the problem of the compatibility of the energy-momentum deﬁnition and

the Poynting theorem (the formula (10) of [2]) with the Relativity Theory (SRT) are the old

ones [24,25]. Pauli [24] stated: “We therefore see that the Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics

is quite incompatible with the existence of charges, unless it is supplemented by extraneous

theoretical concepts.” But, Rohrlich [26] and Butler [27] seem to have solved this problem

establishing for the steady state (when B = v × E is valid) the new expressions for the

energy and momentum of the electromagnetic system

(3b)

(equations (3.39) and (3.40) of [26b]); m is the electromagnetic mass and γ is the usual

contraction factor in the SRT. Butler wrote: “...In the derivation of the Poynting’s theorem

only the two curl equations were used. The two divergence equations were ignored. Therefore

Poynting’s theorem is covariant only if both divergence terms are equal to zero!... only in

the absence of charge! That is the reason that Pauli wrote...” Rohrlich indicated that the

equations (3.39) and (3.40) are deduced from more general form (see (3.23) and (3.24)

therein). The old deﬁnitions U = 1

8π (E2 + B2) and S = 1

4π (E × B) are valid only when

v ≡ 0 (in fact this signiﬁes that the old deﬁnitions are erroneous when applied to the

electrodynamics with moving charges).8 Unfortunately, the expression of Chubykalo [2,

Eq.(28)] seems not to reduce to the Rohrlich-Butler formula in the steady-state limit (i.e.

when E∗ = H∗ = 0).

Next, we shall try to deepen understanding the origins why did Chubykalo obtain such

a strange result. We shall pay attention to the Lagrangian formalism [22,23]. In general, it

is not clear if there may exist a situation when the ﬁelds does not tend to zero at the spatial

inﬁnity, but their variation (and the variation of derivatives) do (the latter is necessary for

the validity of the Lagrangian formalism). But, it is obvious that in the Chubykalo case one

may wish to use the variation procedure for two types of potentials in order to try to obtain

the formula (2). The ordinary Lagrangian

The ﬁrst way to think about the generalization of the Lagrangian for the Chubykalo case

is to try to add the total 4-derivative9 But, in seemingly appropriate case Γµ = AνF µ

ν we

come to the situation when the second-order derivatives enter into the Lagrangian and the

Ostrogradsky procedure becomes to be necessary.

Here, we suggest to generalize the Lagrangian for electromagnetic ﬁeld described by the

4-vector potential in the following way:10

Thus, we introduce the complex 4-potential Aµ = A(elm)

the ﬁelds E∗ and H∗ which do not vanish at the inﬁnity. Obviously, it is Hermitian and

9The Barut formula in ref. [22, p.107] (see the formula next to (3.62)) seems to be incorrect due

to ∂ν Γν may depend on the ﬁeld derivatives and contribute to the second term of (3.62).

10We denote the complex conjugation by a line over a letter. This is used in order not to confuse

with the “star” notation for the free ﬁelds E∗ and B∗ in [2].

leads to Eq. (2). So, this suggestion of ours may have some connections with ref. [15], where

the idea of the complex 4-vector potential has been proposed. This idea should be compared

with the Stepanovski˘ı work [29, p.189], which speculates on the uniﬁcation of gravity with

electromagnetism on the basis of complex potentials in the framework of the Weyl theory. 11

Finally, I want to recall about the problem of energy in quantum electrodynamics. In

ref. [23, p. 89] the book authors write explicitly: “Quantization (12.2) [the standard one]

does not provide the positive deﬁniteness of the mean value of energy” (sic!) After Gupta

and Bleuler [31] by an artiﬁcial procedure (“by hands”) they 1) assumed zero component

of the 4-potential to be anti-Hermitian (sic!),12 2) indeﬁnite metrics in the state-vectors

space, and 3) the weak Lorentz condition. As a result, on the basis of the above postulates,

they obtained the positive deﬁniteness of the energy. If one wants to have negative and zero

energies in the quantization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (as Chubykalo and Ahluwalia) the

answer is simple: they should not apply additional postulates given few lines above.13

Finally, we explained the physical and mathematical content of the paper [2]. The con-

clusion is: we are not yet convinced in the necessity of correction of the formula for the energy

density for radiation ﬁeld because of the absence of ﬁrm experimental and mathematical bases

11The referee of Foundation of Physics Letters rejected [15a] on the basis of no-proof (in his

opinion) of the idea of complex potentials. I disagreed with him on the basis of several papers

exploring 1) possibility of various ﬁeld operators (e.g., the negative energy part of a ﬁeld operator

can be not C conjugate but CP conjugate as in the case of neutrinos – other neutral particles); 2)

complex-space coordinates; 3) possibility of presenting the spinorial aﬃne connection as a complex

4-vector [30,29]. Furthermore, the concurrent paper [15b] has been published.

I consider this

referee to be biased and directed to the destruction of my work.

12This has again relevance to the idea of the complex 4-potential [15].

13Seems, the referee of Foundation of Physics Letters did not read the University textbooks.

The energy conservation law in classical
electrodynamics

E.G.Bessonov

Abstract

In the framework of the classical Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics the energy

conservation law is reconsidered.

1 Introduction

The Poynting theorem has been a corner-stone of electromagnetic theory since its pub-
lication in 1884. Its success have been so many that its limitations have been denied.
The classical electrodynamics is considered to be the consistent relativistic theory.
It
was emphasized that some diﬃculties which appear e.g. when the concept of particles is
introduced or when the equation of motion of particles in view of radiation reaction force
is derived are non-principal. In addition everybody refers to the Poynting theorem that
is to the laws of conservation of energy, linear and angular momentum of the combined
system of particles and ﬁelds.

In the present paper we pay attention to a typical logical mistake made by founders of
classical electrodynamics and adopted by repetition by authors of textbooks on classical
electrodynamics in the case when the law of conservation of energy is derived for a system
consisting of electromagnetic ﬁeld and charged particles. The violation of the law is
displayed when the energy of particles of the system is changed. It means that this law
should be treated as a new open question of classical electrodynamics and references to
this law are incorrect when any diﬃculties are discussed.

Below we will present the detailed and typical proof of the Poynting’s theorem in
the framework of Maxwell electrodynamics and the law of the energy conservation in the
electrodynamics of Maxwell-Lorentz for a system consisting of an electromagnetic ﬁeld
and charged particles. Then we will specify a logic error in the last proof.

2 The laws of conservation in electrodynamics

Let us consider the matter of charged particle is a continuous media. Then from the
Maxwell equations an equation follows

where ~E, ~H are vectors of an electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths, ~ = ρ~v vector of a
current density, ρ a charge density, ~v vector of velocity of motion of the given element of
volume of the charge, ~S = (c/4π)[ ~E ~H] the Pointing vector, c a velocity of light, d ~f = ~n df ,
~n the unit vector normal to the surface limiting some volume V , df the element of the

1

area of the surface (see Appendix 1) [1]. The value w = | ~E|2 + | ~H|2/8π in the Eq(1)
is the density of the energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. If the integration in the Eq(1)
will be made over the whole inﬁnite space than the term with the Poynting’s vector can
be omitted. In this case the electromagnetic ﬁelds emitted by particles in the form of
electromagnetic waves will not go out of the space.

The Eq(1) is derived from the microscopic Maxwell equations. If we replace in the
Eq(1) the values | ~E|2 and | ~H|2 by | ~E|| ~D| and | ~H|| ~B|, where | ~D| and | ~B| are the vectors
of the electric and magnetic inductions then we will have the modiﬁed equation for the
macroscopic electrodynamics [2]. In this case the modiﬁed equation is the statement of
conservation of energy or the well-known Poynting’s theorem written in the integral form:
the time rate of change of electromagnetic energy within a certain volume plus the energy
ﬂowing out through the boundary surfaces of the volume per unit time, is equal to the
V ~ ~E dV done by the ﬁelds on the
negative of the total work per unit time dQ/dt =
t
R
sources within the volume. The energy εnem =
−∞(dQ/dt)dt can be treated through
the non-electromagnetic energy liberated in the volume V by the exited currents (heat
energy or mechanical energy of neutral atoms movement in the heated material bodies).
It does not include any energy of the electromagnetic origin. All electromagnetic energy
is included in the ﬁrst term.

R

The Pointing’s theorem based on the Maxwell equations and the deﬁnition of the work
done by the electric ﬁelds on currents had led to the concept of the energy density of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld w and to the concept of the Poynting vector ~S representing the
energy ﬂow. It emphasised the consistency of the Maxwell electrodynamics.

Later the Poynting theorem was generalized in reference to the case of a combined
system of particles and ﬁelds. A set of Maxwell equations for the electromagnetic ﬁelds
and Lorentz equations for the particles were used. The way of generalization we can
from the textbook [2]: ”The emphasis so far has been on the energy of the
get e.g.
electromagnetic ﬁelds. The work done per unit time per unit volume by the ﬁelds (~ · ~E) is
a conversion of electromagnetic into mechanical or heat energy. Since matter is ultimately
composed of charged particles (electrons and atomic nuclei), we can think of this rate of
conversion as a rate of the charged particles energy increase per unit volume. Then we
can interpret Poynting’s theorem for the microscopic ﬁelds ( ~E, ~H) as a statement of the
energy conservation in the combined system of particles and ﬁelds. If we denote the total
energy of the particles within the volume V as εmech and assume that no particles move

out of the volume, we have dεmech/dt =

(4)

According to (4) the total energy εΣ of the combined system of particles and ﬁelds
in the whole space is constant. This expression is treated as the integral form of the law
of conservation of energy in the electrodynamics of Maxwell-Lorentz for the case when
the system is located in the whole space. This treatment has a logical error and will be
discussed below.

The ﬁrst term in (4) is the sum of the energies of particles εi. It is considered that
the energy of a particle is the value εi = mic2γi, where mi is a mass, γi = 1/
i /c2
is the relativistic factor and vi a velocity of a particle. The dependence of the particle’s
energy on velocity is determined by the requirements of the special theory of relativity.
At introducing of the concept of particles in electrodynamics it is usually postulated, that
the energy of a particle consists partially of the self-energy (or ”inertial energy”) of the
electromagnetic origin εem
and partially from the ﬁeld energy of the non-electromagnetic
origin εnem

Vectors ~E, ~H in (4) represent the total electromagnetic ﬁeld created by a system of par-
ticles and independent ﬁelds. Volume integral of the energy density of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld in the second term of the expression (4) represents the electromagnetic energy of the
system. In the simplest case, when the independent ﬁelds are absent the electromagnetic
~Hi and the electromagnetic
ﬁeld strengths can be presented in the form ~E =

After these remarks we can see that the energy of particles included in the expression

as the sum of energies of non-electromagnetic and electromagnetic origin [1] then it will
mean that the energy of particles of the electromagnetic origin will be included in the
expression (4) twice. All that means that the standard treatment of the expression (4) is

incorrect.3 The expression (4) derived from the Maxwell equations and Lorentz equations
contradicts them. It does not present the energy conservation law [3], [4].

The error in the presented proof consists of the uniﬁcation of the physically inconsistent
Maxwell and Lorentz equations in one system. According to Lorentz equation the total
energy of a charged particle is included in the term εi = mic2γi of the Eq(4). At the
same time according to the Maxwell equations a part of the energy of the particle of the
electromagnetic origin will appear in the term εem
of the same equation. Just this fact
leads to the logic error in the proof of the energy conservation law and because of which
the equation (4) conﬂicts with the initial equations. Now we will illustrate this conclusion
by the next example.

2.1 Example

An immovable large conducting sphere with a charge q and a particle with a charge e and
mass m are separated by a distance a. At some moment the particle start to move and,
being accelerated, leaves to inﬁnity. Let us compare the energy of the particle calculated
from the law of the energy conservation (4) and from the equations of motion.

Let us write down the expression (4) for an initial and a ﬁnal states of the system and

equate received expressions. Then we will determine the kinetic energy of the particle

As was to be expected, an extra term in (5) is equal to a diﬀerence between inertial en-
ergies of electromagnetic ﬁelds of accelerated and motionless particles. For the spherically

symmetric distribution of particle’s charge the value εem
[5], [6]. We can see that the solution (5) of the problem based on the Eq(4) is incorrect. It
diﬀers from the correct solution (6) by the diﬀerence between the ﬁeld energies of moving
particle and the particle at rest. It’s just what has to be expected when we use the Eq(4).

e0 = εem

2.2 Discussion

It is not diﬃcult to understand the reasons according to which the logic error was not
exposed for a so prolonged time. The way of the electrodynamics development was the
next. According to the special theory of relativity the energy and momentum of particles

should have certain transformation properties regardless to theirs nature. The relativistic
mass is a coeﬃcient between vectors of the momentum and velocity of particles. In this
case the Newton’s second law and the Lorentz force govern the dynamics of particles. The
joint solution of the equations of motion of ﬁelds and particles reduces to the expression
(4) which is treated as the energy conservation law. At that it is postulated that the value
w is the energy density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. After this postulate was accepted the
authors do not notice that at the same time this postulate leads to the appearance of the
additional unwanted energy of particles of the electromagnetic origin which is hidden in
the total ﬁeld energy of the system and violate the sense of the received equation. The
nature of mass, energy and momentum of particles are discussed later, after the Eq(4)
is received and interpreted. They are discussed after the electromagnetic ﬁelds and the
corresponding to these ﬁelds energy and momentum of the electromagnetic origin created

not correct transformation properties following from the special theory of relativity4. In
order to give the correct transformation properties and with the purpose of keeping of
the particle charge in equilibrium the attraction ﬁelds of non-electromagnetic origin are
introduced. It is postulated that the energy and momentum of these ﬁelds have wrong
transformation properties of such a form that the sum of the energies of the ﬁelds of the
electromagnetic and non-electromagnetic origin are reduced to experimentally observable
values of energy and momentum of particles5. Again, after these in word only assumptions
there is no discussion of the necessity of taking into account the presence of the ﬁelds of
the non-electromagnetic energy in the equations of motion of particles and ﬁelds and
there is no connection of this discussion with any reference to the conservation law (4)
and its revision. After all, the equations are not changed. Observable mass mi accepted
in word only. It is ﬁnite even in the case of point particles. Both the inertial and radiation
electric ﬁelds of the electromagnetic origin that is the ﬁrst (∼ ˙~v) and higher terms of the
Abraham-Lorentz self-force [2] was kept and work but the corresponding forces of the non-
electromagnetic origin were not introduced and that is why they do not compensate the
corresponding part of the energy and momenta of the ﬁeld term of the Eq(4) (speciﬁcally,
among their number the ﬁeld energy term εem

e0 in the example 1).

e − εem

Unfortunately the laws of conservation, as a rule, were proved only to emphasize the
consistency of the electrodynamics, its perfection. They were not used on practice since
on the basis of the laws it is possible to solve a small number of simple problems not
4In the case of the spherically symmetrical particles besides the correct factor γ there are the incor-
rect factors (1 + v2/3c2) in energy and (4/3) in the momentum of particles [5].
In the case of a the
non-symmetrical particles these factors are more complicated and depend on the orientation of the parti-
cles to the direction of theirs velocity. These factors are changing in time when the particles are in state of
rotation. The corresponding change in time of the energy and momentum of the particles of the electro-
magnetic origin caused by theirs rotation can be compensated only by the ﬁelds of non-electromagnetic
origin but this compensation does not work in the case of the short-range ﬁelds.

5In the case of a non-uniform motion the concepts of the energy and momentum of particles of the
electromagnetic origin were not discussed. Non-obviously they are taken equal to the appropriate values
for the particles moving uniformly with the same velocity.

representing practical interest6. Therefore the error in the proof, which would be possible
to establish by a comparison of the solutions following from the laws of conservation and
from the equations of motion, on particular examples was not discovered.

We have shown that the energy conservation law (4) in the case when the kinetic
energy of particles is changed lead to the solution of the problems which diﬀer from the
solutions derived from the equations of motion of particles in the electromagnetic ﬁelds.
The considered example and the paper [7] have demonstrated this result. At the same
time in the case when the problem deal with the initial and ﬁnal states of the system we
can remove the kinetic energy of the particle of the electromagnetic origin (similar to the
last term in the expression (5)) by hands and such a way to come to a correct solution.
But such solution of the problem (renormalization by hands) means that the Maxwell-
Lorentz electrodynamics is not correct. Moreover this solution is not universal. The last
aﬃrmation was demonstrated in [4] where the problem of two identical charged particles
was considered. In this problem the particles were brought close to each other with equal
constant velocities by extraneous forces along an axis x up to a distance a1. Then the
extraneous forces are switched oﬀ and particles where being decelerated continued to be
brought closer by inertia until they were stopped on a distance a2 < a1. After the stop
of particles the extraneous forces where switched on again to keep particles in the state
of rest. It was shown that contrary to the law of conservation of energy the energy of the
considered system in the ﬁnal state is higher than the energy spent by extraneous forces
on acceleration of particles and their further bringing closer. The idea of this example was
the next. The electrical ﬁeld of a uniformly moving charged particle is ﬂattened in the
direction of motion such a way that on the axis of motion at a distance a its value E|| is
γ2 times less then the electrostatic ﬁeld of the particle at rest being at the same distance
from the observation point [1]. As the repulsive forces between moving particles eEmov
are
weakened γ2 times in comparison with a static case then on a principle of bringing close
the particles to each other with relativistic velocities and subsequent separation them
under non-relativistic velocities one could construct the perpetum mobile7. This problem
means that either possible form of ﬁelds of non-electromagnetic origin must be restricted
or Maxwell-Lorentz equations must be changed.

2.3 Remarks

1. The electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths in the expressions for the Lorentz force, εem
and (~ · ~E) according to Maxwell equations include both the external ﬁelds and self-ﬁelds
6It is possible to point out only on the paper [7] and comment to this paper [8] and close questions
connected, for example, with renormalization of mass in a classical electrodynamics (see [1], § 37, § 65,
Problem 1 ). The term ”renormalization procedure” was appeared ﬁrst in the quantum theory where the
energy ﬁeld term similar to the ﬁeld term in (4) was introduced in the Hamiltonian and where the removal
of divergences was done by veiling the problem by some artiﬁces [9]. At that there was no reference on
the validity of the energy conservation law (4) after such artiﬁces were introduced.”

7In the approximation (v/c)2 this problem can be solved without introduction of the extraneous forces
(Usual solution of the equations of motion or Darwin Lagrangian can be used [1], [2]). The result will be
the same.

produced by charged particles. That is why the radiation reaction force was taken into
account in (2), (4). The energy conservation law was derived without any assumptions
on the value of the external ﬁelds or distances. This statement and the discussion of the
particle nature we can see e.g. in [1] in the form:”One can raise the question of how the
electrodynamics, which satisﬁes the law of conservation of energy, can lead to the absurd
result that a free charge increases its energy without limit. Actually the roots of this
diﬃculty lie in the earlier remarks (Section 5-2) concerning the inﬁnite electromagnetic
”intrinsic mass” of elementary particles. When in the equations of motion we write a
ﬁnite mass for the charge, then in doing this we essentially assign to it formally an inﬁnite
negative ”mass” of non-electromagnetic origin, which together with the electromagnetic
mass should result in a ﬁnite mass for the particle. Since, however, the subtraction of one
inﬁnity from another is not entirely correct mathematical operation, this leads to a series
of further diﬃculties, among which is the one mentioned here”. It means that the authors
consider the statement ”the electrodynamics, which satisﬁes the law of conservation of
energy” as the fundamental law of the electrodynamics. They explain the diﬃculties of
the ”runaway” solutions by the not entirely correct mathematical operation connected
with pointlike dimensions of particles.

2.

In the textbooks the energy conservation law has the form dεΣ/dt = 0 that is
expressed through the change of the total energy. Maybe this fact was the reason of
the fact that the divergence of the value εΣ was not discussed with the reference to the
energy conservation law in the case of the pointlike particles in spite of such particles were
considered in [1] and other textbooks.

3. In the electrodynamics of Maxwell-Lorentz there could not be a model of particles
with pure electromagnetic nature of mass. Diﬀerently all energy would have electromag-
netic nature and the ﬁrst term in (4) should be absent. On the other hand the energy
of charged particle εi cannot have pure non-electromagnetic nature since in the case, for
example, of one particle the energy of extraneous forces applied to a particle will be trans-
formed not only to the value εi and to the energy of the emitted radiation but also to the
electromagnetic self-energy εem of the particle.

4. For the case of one uniformly moving particle the value εΣ depends on a velocity
by the law which diﬀers from the relativistic law. In this case the change of the total
energy of the particle determined by the Eq(4) εΣ 6= γεΣ 0 as the correct transformation
properties has the ﬁrst but has not the second term of this expression representing the
electromagnetic self-energy of the particle [5]. The similar statement is valid for the beam
of charged particles where the situation is intensiﬁed in addition by the circumstance that
besides the electromagnetic self-energy of particles the second term in (4) will include
the electromagnetic energy of interactions of particles which have incorrect and more
complicated transformation properties as well.

3 Conclusion

In electrodynamics there are many ”open” or ”perpetual” problems such as the problem of
the self-energy and momentum of particles, the nature of the particle’s mass, the problem
of the runaway solutions. There is a spectrum of opinions concerning the importance
and the ways of ﬁnding of the answers on these questions [4]. Unfortunately the eﬀorts
of the majority of the authors are directed to avoid similar questions but not to solve
them (see e.g. [1], [2], [5], [9], [10], [11]). In addition they base themselves on the laws of
conservation ostensibly following from the electrodynamics in the most general case and
presenting electrodynamics as the consistent theory. In such stating the arising questions
by their opinion do not have a physical subject of principle and the diﬃculties in their
solution are on the whole in the ﬁeld of the mathematicians. Of cause there is an opinion
that the classical electrodynamics of Maxwell-Lorentz must be changed [11]. Another
Non-Maxwellian Electrodynamics were suggested but none was survived [11]8. All open
questions are now remain unsolved.

It is shown in the present work that contrary to the universal opinion the relation (4)
does not express the energy conservation law in electrodynamics of Maxwell-Lorentz. The
error in the treatment of this expression is the consequence of the insuﬃciently precise
deﬁnitions of the basic concepts of the theory and its logically inconsistent construction.
It follows that in the process of any discussion of the existing diﬃculties of the classical
electrodynamics it is impossible to refer to the energy conservation law in the form, which
was done, for example, in the textbook [1], and the paper [10]. The same conﬁrmation is
valid for the linear and angular momentum conservation laws as well.

We would like to have classical electrodynamics on a level with classical mechanics in
the form of consistent theory. Let the theory doesn’t agree with experiment which require
the quantum mechanical generalization. The generalization of the consistent classical
theory will lead to the consistent quantum theory. There are diﬃculties associated with
the ideas of Maxwell’s theory which are not solved by and not directly associated with
quantum mechanics [11], [12]. This diﬃculties including the problem of the violation of
the energy conservation law for a system of particles and electromagnetic ﬁelds must be
widely presented in the textbooks devoted to the foundations of classical electrodynamics.
We hope for the more comprehensive analysis and further developments of the classical
and quantum electrodynamics.

limiting the volume. If the integration is made through the whole volume of the space i.e.
if a surface of integration is withdrawn to inﬁnity then the surface integral is disappeared
(all particles and ﬁelds remain in space and do not go outside of the limits of the surface
of integration) [1]. In this case the Eq(13) will be transformed into the Eq(4).

We can see that the deduction of the equations (1)-(4), (13) was done at an arbitrary
reference system. It means that the values w, ~S are described by the same form indepen-
dently on reference frame. The vector ~S is included in the operator div and that is why
the Poynting vector ~S is determined with the accuracy to a rot of an arbitrary vector ~A.
But such ambiguity of ~S do not lead to some signiﬁcant physical consequence as the value
rot ~Ad ~f = 0. We have presented this remark in detail because of the erroneous papers
appeared where the form of the values w and ~S depends on the reference system (see e.g.

[12]) and in the textbook [2]).

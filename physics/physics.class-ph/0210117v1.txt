Abstract: In view of the recent interest in a short proof of the Jacobi identity for the
Poisson-brackets (deﬁned in the phase space), we provide an alternative simple proof for
the same. This derivation is valid for (i) the dynamical variables not to be explicitly
dependent on time, and (ii) one of the dynamical variables to be the Hamiltonian function.

In the context of a precise classical description of the particle dynamics, the Poisson brack-
ets (PBs) play a very prominent role as far as the Hamiltonian formulation of the particle
mechanics is concerned (see, e.g., [1]). These PBs are deﬁned in the (momentum) phase
space (i.e. the cotangent space) corresponding to a given conﬁguration space for the dy-
namical description of the particle. The alternative forms of these brackets are also deﬁned
in the conﬁguration space itself for the discussion of the dynamics associated with ﬂuid
mechanics, plasma physics, etc. For instance, the integrable nonlinear partial diﬀerential
equations like KdV, Boussinesq, etc., support two PBs (corresponding to two Hamiltoni-
ans) that are deﬁned in the conﬁguration space [2]. One of these PBs, has already been
shown to have a deep connection with the Virasoro algebra and, in general, W-type alge-
bras that are relevant in the two-dimensional conformal ﬁeld theories and string theories
[2,3,4]. The bilinearity, antisymmetry property and celebrated Jacobi identity, etc., are
some of the key properties that are respected by all the PBs, deﬁned in any context. Many
of the text books on classical mechanics provide the proof of Jacobi identity by exploiting
the tedious (but straightforward) algebra connected with the basic deﬁnition of the PB in
the (momentum) phase space [5-7]. In a recent article [8], a short proof for this identity has
been given by using the concept of inﬁnitesimal canonical transformations for the dynam-
ical variables (deﬁned in the (momentum) phase space) that are not explicitly dependent
on time. The purpose of the present note is to demonstrate that there is yet another simple
proof for the Jacobi identity where mainly the Leibnitz rule is exploited for the derivation.
The latter plays a very important and decisive role in the Hamiltonian description of the
particle dynamics. In fact, a dynamical system is said to be Hamiltonian [1] if and only if
the time derivative acts on a PB as if the latter were a product of two dynamical variables
(see, e.g., (2) below). This statement is nothing but the application of the Leibnitz rule in
the context of Hamiltonian dynamics for the time evolution of a mechanical system.

Let f (q, p) and g(q, p) be a couple of dynamical variables, deﬁned in the (momentum)
phase space. It is evident that, right from the beginning, these variables have no explicit
time dependence. Thus, their time evolution w.r.t. the Hamiltonian function H(q, p) is

where i = 1, 2, 3....s corresponds to the s number of degrees of freedom associated with the
mechanical system and the summation convention is adopted in the deﬁnition of the basic
PB. The application of the Leibnitz rule leads to

The above equation is valid even for the case when f and g are explicitly dependent on
time (see, e.g., [9]). Now exploiting the basic deﬁnition (1) of the time evolution for a

be expressed as

Substitutions of the above expressions into (2) and rearrangements (corresponding mainly
to the antisymmetry property of the PB) yield the Jacobi identity for all the above three
(not explicitly time dependent) dynamical variables as

The limitations of the above proof have already been listed in the abstract of this note.
It is obvious that the present derivation is not as general as the one in [8]. However, the
central concept (that has been exploited here for the derivation) is completely diﬀerent from
the one used in [8]. As far as the emphasis on the evolution of the dynamical system is
concerned, the derivation for the Jacobi identity in this note highlights the key role played
by the Leibnitz rule in the context of Hamiltonian description of the particle mechanics.

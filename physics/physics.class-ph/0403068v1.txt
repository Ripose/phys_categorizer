Abstract

A novel imaging principle based on the interaction of electromagnetic waves with a
beam of relativistic electrons is proposed. Wave-particle interaction is assumed to
take place in a small spatial domain, so that each electron is only brieﬂy accelerated
by the incident ﬁeld. In the one-dimensional case the spatial distribution of the
source density can be directly observed in the temporal spectrum of the scattered
ﬁeld. Whereas, in the two-dimensional case the relation between the source and the
spectrum is shown to be approximately the Radon transform.

Key words: electromagnetism, imaging, relativistic electrons, Radon transform,

1 Introduction

Telescopes, antenna arrays, radars, and imaging interferometers share a com-
mon resolution criterion: the spatial extent of their aperture. Higher resolution
means a larger lens, a larger reﬂector, or a longer interferometer base. At the
present stage any signiﬁcant improvement of the resolution is associated with
extreme technical diﬃculties and costs, and for some applications we are ap-
proaching a limit in this respect. Hence, it makes sense to consider alternative
imaging principles, especially ones where the attainable resolution would not
be entirely controlled by the spatial extent of some ‘aperture’.

In a variety of cases both the observer and the observed object are in rel-
ative motion with respect to each other. A well-known phenomenon related
to this motion is the Doppler eﬀect. It is widely exploited in radar [1], and
acoustical imaging of blood vessels [2], [3], and is sometimes used to improve
the resolution in astronomy [4]. Not to mention the famous red shift of stars
and galaxies around us, which is the main source of cosmological information.
However, in all of these imaging techniques the observer is actually considered
to be at rest. Often, this is just a question of reference frame, and we simply
ﬁnd it convenient to relate ourselves with the one at rest. If for some reason
the motion of the observer cannot be neglected in this way, then our natural
intention is to compensate for it [5], [6].

In this paper we investigate the possibility of exploiting the observer’s motion
in electromagnetic imaging, rather than neglecting or correcting for it. Ap-
parently, for this purpose we need an observer that moves with a relativistic
velocity. This, however, presents not a problem, since an electron, which is
easily accelerated to such velocities, is also the most natural “observer” for
the electromagnetic ﬁeld. An obvious, but not at all unique way to organize
an imaging system of this kind is to let a beam of relativistic electrons inter-
act with the ﬁelds radiated by some remote spatially inhomogeneous source
distribution, say a group of stars. Contrary to standard (stationary) imaging
instruments, here it is the observer’s velocity, not the spatial extent of the
aperture, that determines the attainable resolution.

One of the problems in [7] (p. 249), where a plane monochromatic wave in-
teracts with a single relativistic electron, contains a hint, which has inspired
the present paper. In [7] it is claimed that upon scattering another plane wave
can be observed in the far-ﬁeld, which has a diﬀerent frequency with respect
to the incident one, depending on the angles of incidence and observation.
Here we simulate an imaging setup and, therefore, consider incident ﬁelds
due to a remote but spatially extended source. These ﬁelds interact with a
short segment of a relativistic current. The short-segment assumption allows
to circumvent the diﬃcult problem of charge dynamics. Straightforward cal-
culations presented below show that the relation between the spatial density
distribution of the source and the (temporal) spectrum of the secondary ﬁeld
radiated by the electrons is approximately a Radon transform. This transform
is well known in imaging theory and is amenable to invertion [8]. Mathemati-
caly, the particular form of the Radon transform obtained here is very similar
to the Doppler and Doppler-Radon transforms, which are extensively studied
in the (non-relativistic) acoustical imaging of ﬂuid ﬂows [2], [3].

The author does not claim to have covered all physical and mathematical
aspects of this interesting problem. In fact, to arrive at the Radon transform
in its simplest form we make several approximations, the signiﬁcance of which
must be further investigated both theoretically and experimentally.

2 Theory

Let there be a remote spatially inhomogeneous and time varying source of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld. We consider the scattering of this ﬁeld by a segment
of relativistic electric current, e.g. a beam of electrons moving with a rela-
tivistic velocity in a particle accelerator or even a simple cathode ray tube.
Neglecting the mutual interaction between the electrons, quantum eﬀects, as
well as the radiation reaction force, we would like to calculate the secondary
electromagnetic ﬁeld, scattered by this relativistic current into the far-ﬁeld
zone.

Let xe(t) denote the location of a single moving electron and let Ds be a
bounded region of space occupied by an external source of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld (see Fig. 1). Presume that Ds is far enough both from the origin of
the coordinate system and location xe(t), so that the distance factor can be
approximated by

This expression describes the scattering by a single electron. The electric ﬁeld
scattered by a beam of non-interacting electrons is simply the sum of the
ﬁelds scattered by each electron individually. All these ﬁelds can be computed
using (6), provided that the electron velocities are given. In principle, these
velocities are solutions of the relativistic equation of motion (4), which is a
nonlinear equation and therefore very diﬃcult, if not impossible, to solve. For
our purposes, however, it is not necessary to know the velocities exactly. We
rather need a reliable estimate on their variation with respect to the initial
relativistic velocity.

To obtain such an estimate we use the Taylor expansion

(7)

ve(t0 + ∆t) = ve(t0) + ∂tve

and observe that ve(t) can be approximated by the initial velocity up to the
order ∆t – the time of the ﬁeld-particle interaction. Note, if ∆t is suﬃciently
small, then the initial velocity approximation is suitable even for nonvanishing
accelerations, and is, therefore, consistent with the idea of the secondary (i.e.
acceleration related) radiation. Since ∆t is approximately the time of ﬂight
of electrons across the interaction area, one can decrease ∆t by decreasing
this area. This can be achieved by either actually creating a relatively short
relativistic current (radio frequencies) or by focusing the incident ﬁelds (op-
tics), so that the latter are diﬀerent from zero only within a certain ﬁnite and
relatively small spatial domain. Under these assumtions we may take in (6)

ve(t0) = constant,
β(t0) = constant,
nv(t0) = constant.

As far as the electron location xe(te) is concerned, we are only interested in
xe(te) within the (small) area of interaction. For each electron this location
(∆t). Under these assumptions the distance
depends on time linearly up to
expression (1) becomes

therefore, approximately the same time is now associated with all electrons

Remarkably, frequency relation (16) coincides with the one obtained in [7] for
the plane-wave case, which did not involve any approximations. We see now
that even to a purely harmonic but spatially extended source there corresponds
a whole set of frequencies in the scattered wave, which depend on the particular
values admitted by ns and nv in (16). To obtain a more elaborate relation
between the spatial distribution of the source current density and the spectrum

of the scattered wave we take the Fourier transform of the observed electric
ﬁeld strength with respect to time. But ﬁrst we simplify (14) by resorting to
the eﬀective two-dimensional aperture As (see Fig. 1), so that for a purely
harmonic source (15) we have

where e and h are the eﬀective transverse ﬁelds with inhomogeneous angular
distribution. All unimportant coeﬃcients here and below are lumped with the
constant of proportionality C. Notice that factor exp (iωt) cannot be taken
outside the integral, since ω depends on the integration variable. The Fourier
transform of the left-hand-side must be taken with respect to the observation
time. Whereas, using the following simple manipulation:

Subsequent transformations involve assumptions about the spatial coherence
of the source, which are beyond the scope of this paper, but can be found for
example in [9].

Anyway, it is clear that, if we consider two incoherent point sources, then
the observed ﬁeld has only two Fourier components corresponding to the fre-
quencies, which can be easily determined from (16). In other words, we shall
directly observe an image of our sources in the temporal spectrum of the ﬁeld.
Separation between the spectral lines depends on the angular separation of
the sources and the electron velocity. The higher the velocity, the better the
attainable spatial (angular) resolution.

3 Discussion

Unfortunately, there is no such thing in Nature as a purely monochromatic
source of type (15). Therefore, even in the preceding simple one-dimensional
example one should expect broadening of each of the two observed lines pro-
portional to the broadening of the source’s spectral line. In terms of the image
quality this leads to the loss of spatial resolution – blurring. In addition, spec-
tral resolution of the dispersing instrument (e.g. a prism or a grating) must
be taken into account. Imagine two identical dispersing instruments. We place
one of them on the path between the source and the interaction area, so that
only one spectral line of width ∆ωs is allowed through. Another dispersing
instrument is used to investigate the spectral content of the scattered ﬁeld.
Then, for the two sources to be resolved, the electron velocity must satisfy

Another anticipated cause of blurring is the variation of the particle velocity
inside the interaction area, if the latter could not be made suﬃciently small.
The Fourier transform of (18) with a time-varying velocity will then introduce
an extra convolution in ωo-domain with the temporal Fourier transform of the
electron velocity.

Correspondence between the spectrum and the source for two-dimensional
distributions is not as direct as in the one-dimensional case. To invert the
Radon transform spectral data for diﬀerent directions of the velocity vector
must be collected, i.e. we have to introduce the mutual rotation between the
source and the particle accelerator around the axis perpendicular to the plane
of the source. Subsequently, numerical inversion of the Radon transform must
be carried out.

In summary, the proposed relativistic alternative to aperture-based imaging
consists of employing a beam of relativistic electrons as a detector in an optical
imaging system. A classical treatment of this problem has been presented. A
more reﬁned analysis would have to take into account: the mutual interaction
between electrons, the radiation reaction force, and the quantum eﬀects. The
question of coherence must be investigated in more detail as well.

The author is grateful to Prof. A. T. de Hoop (Delft University of Technology)

ing the relativistic equation of motion. The author also appreciates numerous

Abstract: We review the formulation of the problem of the electromagnetic self-interaction
of a relativistic charged particle in the framework of the manifestly covariant classical
mechanics of Stueckeleberg, Horwitz and Piron. The gauge ﬁelds of this theory, in gen-
eral, cause the mass of the particle to change. We show that the non-linear Lorentz force
equation for the self-interaction resulting from the expansion of the Green’s function has
chaotic solutions. We study the autonomous equation for the oﬀ-shell particle mass here,
for which the eﬀective charged particle mass achieves a macroscopic average value deter-
mined by what appears to be a strange attractor.

1. Introduction

The advent of powerful computers in the second half of the twentieth century has
made it a possible and attractive possibility to investigate physical problems that involve
a high level of intrinsic nonlinearity. The remarkable discovery by Lorenz in 1963[1] that
rather simple nonlinear systems are capable of displaying highly complex, unstable, and,
in many cases, beautiful, systems of orbits, gave rise to the subject of chaos, now under
intensive study both in speciﬁc applications and in its general properties. The instability of
these orbits is characterized by the fact that small variations of initial conditions generate
new orbits that diverge from the original orbit exponentially.

Such studies range from nonlinear dynamical systems, both dissipative and non-
dissipative, involving deterministic chaos, and hard surface type collisions (for example,
billliards), to the study of ﬂuctation phenomena in quantum ﬁeld theory [2]. The re-
sults have led to a deeper understanding of turbulence in hydrodynamics, the behavior of
nonlinear electrical circuits, plasmas, biological systems and chemical reactions. It has,
furthermore, given deep insights into the foundations of statistical mechanics.

What appears to be a truly striking fact that has emerged from this experience, is that
the appearance of what has become to be known as chaotic behavior is not just the property
of some special systems designed for the purpose of achieving some result depending on
the nonlinearity, such as components of an electric circuit, but seems to occur almost
universally in our perception of the physical world. The potentialities presented by this
subject are therefore very extensive, and provide a domain for discovery that appears to
be virtually unlimited.

As an example of the occurrence of chaotic behavior in one of the most fundamental
and elementary systems in nature, we wish to discuss here the results of our study of the
classical relativistic charged particle (for example, the classical electron without taking
into account the dynamical eﬀects of its spin, an intrinsically quantum eﬀect).

There remains, in the area of research on chaotic systems, the question of making a
correspondence between classical chaotic behavior and the properties of the corresponding
quantum systems. Much is known on the signatures of chaos for quantum systems, for
example, the occurrence of Wigner distributions in the spectra for Hamiltonian chaos. The
study of relativistic phenomena, of the type we shall consider here, where the explicit self-
interaction problem gives rise to instability, may have a counterpart in the renormalization
program in quantum ﬁeld theory. The existence of radiation due to the accelerated motion
of the particle raises the question of how this radiation, acting back on the particle, aﬀects
its motion. Rohrlich [3] has described the historical development of this problem, where
the ﬁrst steps were taken by Abraham in 1905[4], culminating in the work of Dirac[5], who
derived the equation for the ideal point electron in the form

where m is the electron mass, including electromagnetic correction, s is the proper time
along the trajectory xµ(s) in spacetime, F µ
ν is the covariant form of the electromagnetic
force tensor, e is the electron charge, and

Here, the indices µ, ν, running over 0, 1, 2, 3, label the spacetime variables that rep-
resent the action of the Lorentz group; the index raising and lowering Lorentz invariant
1, +1, +1, +1). The expression for Γµ was originally found
tensor ηµν is of the form diag(
by Abraham in 1905[4], shortly after the discovery of special relativity, and is known as
the Abraham four-vector of radiation reaction. Dirac’s derivation [5] was based on a di-
rect application of the Green’s functions for the Maxwell ﬁelds, obtaining the form (1.1),
which we shall call the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac equation. In this calculation, Dirac used
the diﬀerence between retarded and advanced Green’s functions, so as to eliminate the
singularity carried by each. Sokolov and Terner [6], for example, give a derivation using
the retarded Green’s function alone, and show how the singular term can be absorbed into
the mass m.

The formula (1.1) contains a so-called singular perturbation problem. There is a small
coeﬃcient multiplying a derivative of higher order than that of the unperturbed problem;
since the highest order derivative is the most important in the equation, one sees that,
dividing by e2, any small deviation in the lower order terms results in a large eﬀect on the
orbit, and there are unstable solutions, often called “runaway solutions”. There is a large
literature [7] on the methods of treating this instability, and there is considerable discussion
in Rohrlich’s book [3] as well (he describes a method for eliminating the unstable solutions
by studying asymptotic properties).

The existence of these “runaway solutions”, for which the electron undergoes an ex-
ponential accelaration with no external force beyond a short initial perturbation of the
free motion, is a diﬃculty for the point electron picture in the framework of the Maxwell
theory with the covariant Lorentz force. Rohrlich [8] has discussed the idea that the point
electron idealization may not be really physical, based on arguments from classical and
quantum theory, and emphasized that, for the corresponding classical problem, a ﬁnite
size can eliminate this instability. Of course, this argument is valid, but it leaves open
the question of the consistency of the Maxwell-Lorentz theory which admits the concept
of point charges, as well as what is the nature of the elementary charges that make up the
extended distribution.

It is quite remarkable that Gupta and Padmanabhan[9], using essentially geometri-
cal arguments (solving the static problem in the frame of the accelerating particle with
a curved background metric), have shown that the description of the motion of an accel-
erating charged particle must include the radiation terms of the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac
equation. Recognizing that the electron’s acceleration precludes the use of a sequence of
“instantaneous” inertial frames to describe the action of the forces on the electron [10],
they carry out a Fermi-Walker transformation [11], going to an accelerating frame (as-
suming constant acceleration) in which the electron is actually inertial, and there solve the
Coulomb problem in the curved coordinates provided by the Fermi-Walker transformation.
Transforming back to laboratory coordinates, they ﬁnd the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac equa-
tion without the direct use of the Maxwell Green’s functions for the radiation ﬁeld. This
result, suggesting the relevance of curvature in the spacetime manifold, such as that gen-
erated by sources in general relativity, along with other, more elementary manifestations
of mass renormalization (such as the contribution to the mass due to electromagnetic in-
teractions and the identiﬁcation of the Green’s function singularity contribution with part

3

of the electron mass), carries an implication that the electron mass may play an important
dynamical role.

Stueckelberg, in 1941[12], proposed a manifestly covariant form of classical and quan-
tum mechanics in which space and time become dynamical observables. They are therefore
represented in quantum theory by operators on a Hilbert space on square integrable func-
tions in space and time. The dynamical development of the state is controlled by an
invariant parameter τ , which one might call the world time, coinciding with the time on
the (on mass shell)freely falling clocks of general relativity. Stueckelberg [12] started his
analysis by considering a classical world-line, and argued that under the action of forces,
the world line would not be straight, and in fact could be curved back in time. He identi-
ﬁed the branch of the curve running backward in time with the antiparticle, a view taken
also by Feynman in his perturbative formulation of quantum electrodynamics in 1948 [11].
Realizing that such a curve could not be parametrized by t (for some values of t there
are two values of the space variables), Stueckelberg introduced the parameter τ along the
trajectory.

This parameter is not necessarily identical to proper time, even for inertial motion for
which proper time is a meaningful concept. Stueckelberg postulated the existence of an
invariant “Hamiltonian” K, which would generate Hamilton equations for the canonical
variables xµ and pµ of the form

and

where the dot indicates diﬀerentiation with respect to τ . Taking, for example, the model

we see that the Hamilton equations imply that

It then follows that

and hence the proper time is not identical to the evolution parameter τ . In the case that
m2 = M 2, it follows that ds = dτ , and we say that the particle is “on shell”.

For example, in the case of an external potential V (x), where we write x

Hamiltonian becomes

xµ, the

≡

so that, since K is a constant of the motion, m2 varies from point to point with the
variations of V (x). It is important to recognize from this discussion that the observable
particle mass depends on the state of the system (in the quantum theory, the expectation
value of the operator pµpµ provides the expected value of the mass squared).

One may see, alternatively, that phenomenologically the mass of a nucleon, such as
the neutron, clearly depends on the state of the system. The free neutron is not stable,
but decays spontaneously into a proton, electron and antineutrino, since it is heavier than
the proton. However, bound in a nucleus, it may be stable (in the nucleus, the proton may
decay into neutron, positron and neutrino, since the proton may be suﬃciently heavier
than the neutron). The mass of the bound electron (in interaction with the electromag-
netic ﬁeld), as computed in quantum electrodynamics, is diﬀerent from that of the free
electron, and the diﬀerence contributes to the Lamb shift. This implies that, if one wishes
to construct a covariant quantum theory, the variables E (energy) and pµ should be inde-
pendent, and not constrained by the relation E2 = p2 + m2, where m is a ﬁxed constant.
This relation implies, moreover, that m2 is a dynamical variable. It then follows, quantum
mechanically, through the Fourier relation between the energy-momentum representation
of a wave function and the spacetime representation, that the variable t, along with the
variable x is a dynamical variable. Classically, t and x are recognized as variables of the
phase space through the Hamilton equations.

Since, in nature, particles appear with fairly sharp mass values (not necessarily with
zero spread), we may assume the existence of some mechanism which will drive the parti-
cle’s mass back to its original mass-shell value (after the source responsible for the mass
change ceases to act) so that the particle’s mass shell is deﬁned. We shall not take such
a mechanism into account explicitly here in developing the dynamical equations. We shall
assume that if this mechanism is working, it is a relatively smooth function (for example,
a minimum in free energy which is broad enough for our oﬀ-shell driving force to work
fairly freely)1

In an application of statistical mechanics to this theory[15], it has been found that a
high temperature phase transition can be responsible for the restriction of the particle’s
mass (on the average, in equilibrium). In the present work, we shall see that, at least in

1 A relativistic Lee model has been worked out which describes a physical mass shell
as a resonance, and therefore a stability point on the spectrum [14], but at this point it is
not clear to us how this mechanism works in general. It has been suggested by T. Jordan
[personal communication] that the deﬁnition of the physical mass shell could follow from
the interaction of the particle with ﬁelds (a type of “self-interaction”); this mechanism
could provide for perhaps more than one mass state for a particle, such as the electron and
muon and the various types of neutrinos, but no detailed model has been so far studied.

the classical theory, the non-linear equations induced by radiation reaction may have a
similar eﬀect.

A theory of Stueckelberg type, providing a framework for dynamical evolution of a
relativistic charged particle, therefore appears to be a natural dynamical generalization of
the curved space formulation of Gupta and Padmanbhan[9] and the static picture of Dirac.
We shall study this in the following.

The Stueckelberg formulation implies the existence of a ﬁfth “electromagnetic” poten-
tial, through the requirement of gauge invariance, and there is a generalized Lorentz force
which contains a term that drives the particle oﬀ-shell, whereas the terms corresponding to
the electric and magnetic parts of the usual Maxwell ﬁelds do not (for the nonrelativistic
case, the electric ﬁeld may change the energy of a charged particle, but not the magnetic
ﬁeld; the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor in our case is analogous to the magnetic ﬁeld, and
the new ﬁeld strengths, derived from the τ dependence of the ﬁelds and the additional
gauge ﬁeld, are analogous to the electric ﬁeld, as we shall see).

In the following, we give the structure of the ﬁeld equations, and show that the
standard Maxwell theory is properly contained in this more general framework. Applying
the Green’s functions to the current source provided by the relativistic particle, and the
generalized Lorentz force, we obtain equations of motion for the relativistic particle which
is, in general oﬀ-shell. As in Dirac’s result, these equations are of third order in the
evolution paramter, and therefore are highly unstable. However, the equations are very
nonlinear, and give rise to chaotic behavior.

Our results exhibit what appears to be a strange attractor in the phase space of
the autonomous equation for the oﬀ-mass shell deviation, This attractor may stabilize
the electron’s mass in some neighborhood. We conjecture that it stabilizes the orbits
macroscopically as well, but a detailed analysis awaits the application of more powerful
computing facilities and procedures.

2. Equations of motion

state state over the manifold of spacetime was postulated by Stueckelberg[10] to be, for

Taking into account full U (1) gauge invariance, corresponding to the requirement
that the theory maintain its form under the replacement of ψ by eie0Λψ, the Stueckelberg-
Schr¨odinger equation (including a compensation ﬁeld for the τ -derivative of Λ) is [16]

equations of motion for the ﬁeld variables are given (for both the classical and quantum
theories) by [16]

A Hamiltonian of the form (2.3) without τ dependence of the ﬁelds, and without the a5
terms, as written by Stueckelberg [10], can be recovered in the limit of the zero mode of
the ﬁelds (with a5 = 0) in a physical state for which this limit is a good approximation
i.e., when the Fourier transform of the ﬁelds, deﬁned by

(2.10)

has support only in the neighborhood ∆s of s = 0. The vector potential then takes on the
form aµ(x, τ )
∆sˆaµ(x, 0) = (∆s/2πλ)Aµ(x), and we identify e = (∆s/2πλ)e0. The zero
mode therefore emerges when the inverse correlation length of the ﬁeld ∆s is suﬃciently
small, and then η = 2πλ/∆s. We remark that in this limit, the ﬁfth equation obtained from
(2.4) decouples. The Lorentz force obtained from this Hamiltonian, using the Hamilton
equations, coincides with the usual Lorentz force, and, as we have seen, the generalized
Maxwell equation reduce to the usual Maxwell equations. The theory therefore contains
the usual Maxwell Lorentz theory in the limit of the zero mode; for this reason we have
called this generalized theory the “pre-Maxwell” theory.

If such a pre-Maxwell theory really underlies the standard Maxwell theory, then there
should be some physical mechanism which restricts most observations in the laboratory
to be close to the zero mode. For example, in a metal there is a frequency, the plasma
frequency, above which there is no transmission of electromagnetic waves. In this case, if
the physical universe is imbedded in a medium which does not allow high “frequencies”
to pass, the pre-Maxwell theory reduces to the Maxwell theory. Some study has been
carried out, for a quite diﬀerent purpose (of achieving a form of analog gravity), of the
properties of the generalized ﬁelds in a medium with general dielectric tensor[19]. We shall
see in the present work that the high level of nonlinearity of this theory in interaction with
matter may itself generate an eﬀective reduction to Maxwell-Lorentz theory, with the high
frequency chaotic behavior providing the regularization achieved by models of the type
discussed by Rohrlich[8].

We remark that integration over τ does not bring the generalized Lorentz force into
the form of the standard Lorentz force, since it is nonlinear, and a convolution remains. If
the resulting convolution is trivial, i.e., in the zero mode, the two theories then coincide.
Hence, we expect to see dynamical eﬀects in the generalized theory which are not present
in the standard Maxwell-Lorentz theory.

this equation therefore does not necessarily lead to the trivial relation between ds and dτ

3. Derivation of the diﬀerential equations for the spacetime orbit with oﬀ-shell
corrections

We now review the derivation of the radiation reaction formula in the Stueckelberg
formalism (see also [17]. Calculating the self interaction contribution one must include
the eﬀects of the force acting upon the particle due to its own ﬁeld (fself ) in addition to
the ﬁelds generated by other electromagnetic sources (fext). Therefore, the generalized
Lorentz force, using Eq.(2.12) takes the form:

Integrating this expression over all τ gives the Green’s function for the standard Maxwell
ﬁeld. Assuming that the radiation reaction acts causally in τ , we shall use here the τ -
retarded Green’s function. In his calculation of the radiation corrections to the Lorentz
force, Dirac used the diﬀerence between advanced and retarded Green’s functions in order
to cancel the singularities that they contain. One can, alternatively use the retarded
Green’s function and “renormalize” the mass in order to eliminate the singularity [6]. In
this analysis, we follow the latter procedure.

The τ - retarded Green’s function [17] is given by multiplying the principal part of the
integral Eq.(3.4) by θ(τ ). Carrying out the integrations (on a complex contour in κ; we
consider the case σ = +1 in the following), one ﬁnds (this Green’s function diﬀers from
the t-retarded Green’s function, constructed on a complex contour in k0),

The Green’s function is written as a scalar, acting in the same way on all ﬁve com-
ponents of the source jα; to assure that the resulting ﬁeld is in Lorentz gauge, however, it
should be written as a ﬁve by ﬁve matrix, with the factor δα
kαkβ/k2 (k5 = κ) included
in the integrand. Since we compute only the gauge invariant ﬁeld strengths here, this extra
term will not inﬂuence any of the results. It then follows that the generalized Lorentz force
for the self-action (the force of the ﬁelds generated by the world line on a point xµ(τ ) of
the trajectory), along with the eﬀect of external ﬁelds, is

In the self-interaction problem where τ

0, the Green’s function
is very divergent. Therefore one can expand all expressions in τ ′′ = τ
τ ′ assuming that
the dominant contribution is from the neighborhood of small τ ′′ . The divergent terms are
later absorbed into the mass and charge deﬁnitions leading to renormalization (eﬀective
mass and charge). Expanding the integrands in Taylor series around the most singular

We remark that as in [17] it can be shown that Eq.(3.28) reduces to the ordinary
(Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac) radiation reaction formula for small, slowly changing ε and that
that no instability, no radiation, and no acceleration of the electron occurs when it is on
shell. There is therefore no “runaway solution” for the exact mass shell limit of this theory;
the unstable Dirac result is approximate for ε close to, but not precisely zero.

4. The ε evolution

We now derive an equation for the evolution of the oﬀ-shell deviation, ε, when the
external ﬁeld is removed. We then use this equation to prove that a ﬁxed mass-shell is
consistent only if the particle is not accelerating, and therefore no runaway solution occurs.

5. Dynamical Behavior of System

In this section, we present results of a preliminary study of the dynamical behavior of
the system. The four orbit equations pose a very heavy computational problem, which we
shall treat in a later publication. We remark here, however, that the quantities dx/dτ and
dt/dτ appear to rise rapidly, but the ratio, corresponding to the observed velocity dx/dt
actually falls, indicating that what would be observed is a dissipative eﬀect.

We shall concentrate here on the evolution of the oﬀ-shell mass correction ε, and show

that there is a highly complex dynamical behavior showing strong evidence of chaos.

It appears that ε reaches values close to (but less than) unity, and there exhibits very
complex behavior, with large ﬂuctuations. The eﬀective mass M (ε, ˙ε) therefore appears to
reach a macroscopically steady value, apparently a little less than unity. In this neighbor-
hood, it is easy to see from the expression (3.26) that the eﬀective mass itself becomes very
ε)3, and therefore the eﬀect of the Lorentz forces in producing acceleration
large, as ˙ε/(1
−
becomes small.

The third order equation of ε, Eq.(4.6), can be written as a set of three ﬁrst order

equations of the form

(5.1)

dγ
dt

= H(γ),

16

where γ = γ1, γ2, γ3 = ε, ˙ε, ¨ε. We have obtained numerical solutions over a range of
variation of τ . In ﬁgure 1, we show, on a logarithmic scale, these three functions; one sees
rapid ﬂuctuations in γ2 and γ3, and large variations in γ1. The action of what appears to
be an attractor occurs on these graphs in the neighborhood of τ = 0.002 (time steps were
6). The time that the system remains on this attractor, in
taken to be of the order of 10−
our calculation about four times this interval, covers about three cycles. The characteristics
of the orbits in phase space are very complex, reﬂecting an evolution of the nature of the
attractor.

The dynamical signiﬁcance of these functions is most clearly seen in the phase space
plots. In ﬁgure 2, we show ¨ε = γ3 vs.
˙ε = γ2. This ﬁgure shows the approach to the
apparent attractor inducing motion beginning at the lower convex portion of the unsym-
metrical orbit which then turns back in a characteristic way to reach the last point visible
on this graph. We then continue to examine the motion on a larger scale, where we show,
in ﬁgure 3, that this end point opens to a larger and more symmetric pattern. The orbit
then continues, as shown in ﬁgure 4 to a third loop, much smaller, which then reaches a
structure that is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. The end region of this cycle is shown on larger
scale in ﬁgure 5, where a small cycle terminates in oscillations that appear to become very
rapid as ε approaches unity. The coeﬃcients in the diﬀerential equation become very large
in this neighborhood.

In ﬁgure 6 we see the approach to the attractor in the graph of ˙ε = γ2 vs. ε = γ1;
this curve enters a region of folding, which develops to a loop shown in ﬁgure 7a,and in
ﬁg. 7b, on a larger scale, where we had to terminate the calculation due to limitations of
our computer.

We have computed the global Lyapunov exponents according to the standard proce-
dures; recognizing, however, that there appear to be (at least) two levels of behavior types,
we have studied the integration on phase space for ε somewhat less than unity, since the
integration diverges for ε close to one. For ε very close to one, in fact, due to the relation
ε)dτ , this neighborhood contributes very little to the development of the observed
ds = (1
orbits.

−

In this calculation, we have computed the largest Lyapunov exponent (positive) by
studying the average separation of the orbits associated with nearby initial conditions
[20]. We show the develpment of the Lyapunov exponent as the average is taken over an
increasing interval in ﬁg. 8 as data is accumulated up to 13,800 iterations (at least two
cycles on the attractor). Note that there are intervals of relative stability and very strong
instability.

Starting the calulation with diﬀerent initial conditions, we found very similar dynam-

ical behavior, conﬁrming the existence of the apparent attractor.

We have also studied the time series associated with the three variables of the phase
space, shown in ﬁgures 9-11. The autocorrelation functions for ¨ε and ˙ε fall oﬀ quickly
giving characteristic correlation times; the autocorrelation function for ε does not fall oﬀ
faster than linearly, but the time series shows signiﬁcant structure resembling the phase
space structure (subtracting out the local average from the function ε generates a deviation
function that does indeed show a fall oﬀ of the autocorrelation function). We have used
these scales, for 20 time steps (for ¨ε and ε) and 40 time steps (for ˙ε, to contruct a three

17

dimensional delay phase space for the time series for each of these functions.

In ﬁgs. 12a and 12b, we show the behavior of solution of the autonomous equation
˙ε. These results are very similar in form to those given above,

for ˙ε vs. ε and ¨ε vs.
demonstrating stability of the results.

6. Discussion

We have examined the equations of motion generated for the classical relativistic
charged particle, taking into account dynamically generated variations in the mass of the
particle, and the existence of a ﬁfth electromagnetic type potential essentially reﬂecting
the gauge degree of freedom of the variable mass. We have focussed our attention on the
autonomous equation for the oﬀ-shell mass deviation deﬁned in (2.15) and (2.17) as an
indication of the dynamical behavior of the system, and shown that there indeed appears to
be a highly complex strange attractor. It is our conjecture that the formation of dynamical
attractors of this type in the orbit equations as well will lead to a macroscopically smooth
behavior of the perturbed relativistic charged particle, possibly associated with an eﬀective
non-zero size, as discussed, for example, by Rohrlich[8]. Some evidence for such a smooth
behavior appears in the very large eﬀective mass generated near ε ∼= 1, stabilizing the
eﬀect of the Lorentz forces, as well as our preliminary result that the larger accellerations
emerging in derivatives with respect to τ are strongly damped, in this neighborhood of ε,
in the transformation to motion seen as velocity (dx/dt) in a particular frame.

Our investigation of the phase space of the autonomous equation used somewhat
arbitrary initial conditions, and we ﬁnd that changing these conditions somewhat does not
aﬀect the general pattern of the results. Moreover, since ¨ε depends on the third derivative
of xµ(τ ), this initial condition should not be taken as arbitrary, but as determined by the
results for the orbit (initial conditions for the orbit depend only on xµ and its ﬁrst two
derivatives). Computing the orbit for a typical choice of initial conditions, and using the
result to ﬁx ¨ε, we ﬁnd that the corresponding solution of the autonomous equation indeed
lies in the attractor. The results of our investigation of the autonomous equation should
therefore be valid for initial conditions that obey the physical constraints imposed by the
equations of motion as well.

We have speciﬁed all of the dynamical equations here, but a complete investigation
must await further planned work with more powerful computing facilities and procedures.

Abstrat. We show that the Lorentz-Dira equation is not an unavoidable

onsequene of energy-momentum onservation for a point harge. What follows solely

from onservation laws is a less restritive equation already obtained by Honig and

Szamosi. The latter is not properly an equation of motion beause, as it ontains an

extra salar variable, it does not determine the future evolution of the harge. We

show that a supplementary onstitutive relation an be added so that the motion is

determined and free from the troubles that are ustomary in Lorentz-Dira equation,

i. e. preaeleration and runaways.

On the motion of a lassial harged partile

2

1. Introdution

Lorentz-Dira equation is widely aepted as the lassial equation of motion of

an elementary point harge interating with its own radiation (see for instane

[7, 18, 21, 26℄):

maµ = F µ +

2e2
3c3 (cid:18)

˙aµ −

1
c2 aλaλvµ

,

(cid:19)

where F µ = e

c F µν

extvν is the external eletromagneti fore.

(1)

It is also well known that this equation is a(cid:27)eted by some irreoniliable di(cid:30)ulties,

that already show up in the ase of retilinear motion. Consider a free point harge that

enters perpendiularly a parallel-plate apaitor at τ = 0 (proper time) and leaves it
at τ1 > 0. For τ < 0 the harge is free, f µ = 0 and the solution to (1) is a uniform
retilinear motion, aµ = 0. We an therefore take aµ(0) = 0 and vµ(0) = vµ
in as
initial data to integrate equation (1), so obtaining a unique solution for the veloity vµ

.

Nevertheless, this solution has the drawbak that, not only aµ(τ ) does not vanish for

τ > τ1 (when the external ation has eased), but it grows exponentially for τ → ∞,

what is known as runaway solution.

Rohrlih [18℄ put forward a way out onsisting in that (1) is not the equation of

motion, but it must be supplemented with an asymptoti ondition:

if the external

fore f µ

asymptotially vanishes, then the aeleration aµ

asymptotially vanishes too.

As a result the resulting equation of motion is of integro-di(cid:27)erential type and runaway

solutions are ruled out (see also [12℄).

This alternative however implies what is alled preaeleration. Although the

external fore vanishes for τ < 0, the solution to the above integro-di(cid:27)erential equation

presents non-vanishing aeleration before the fore starts. This is not a surprising

feature beause, as pointed out in [6℄, it is a onsequene of demanding the asymptoti

ondition in the future: the integro-di(cid:27)erential equation of motion itself (cid:16)foresees(cid:17) what

will happen in the future, τ > τ1 .

It thus seems as though we were faing the following dilemma [6℄: either (a) lassial

eletrodynamis is self-ontraditory or (b) Lorentz-Dira equation is not the right

equation that follows from lassial eletrodynamis.

In view of this dilemma di(cid:27)erent stanes are found in the literature. Rohrlih [18℄

adopts the alternative (a) and adds that this is not a ma jor trouble beause the time

On the motion of a lassial harged partile

sale at whih preaeleration shows up is too small (τ0 ≈ 10−23

s for eletrons) far

beyond the limits of validity of the lassial theory. He further stresses that [20℄ (cid:19)the

notion of (cid:16)lassial point harge(cid:17) is an oxymoron . . . (cid:20) sine lassial physis eases to be

valid below Compton wavelength. Moniz and Sharp also argued [15, 16, 17℄ that lassial

eletrodynamis is only onsistent in desribing the motion of harges with radius larger

than the lassial eletron radius, while the quantum theory of nonrelativisti harges

is free of runaways and preaeleration.

Other authors [27, 34℄ embrae the alternative (b) on the basis that the derivation

of Lorentz-Dira equation involves Taylor expansions and therefore presumes that both

the harge worldline and the external fore are analyti funtions. As a onsequene,

equation (1) is not valid in those points where xµ(τ ) and f µ(τ ) are not analyti.

Partiularly, Yaghjian [34℄ studies a harged spherial shell of radius ǫ and obtains

an alternative equation:

maµ = f µ +

2e2
3c3 η(τ )

(cid:18)

˙aµ −

1
c2 aλaλvµ

(cid:19)

where η(τ ) = 0 for τ < 0 and η(τ ) = 1 for τ ≥ 2ǫ/c.

In another approah

[13, 23, 5, 1, 3, 2, 24℄, the Lorentz-Dira equation is thought of as a neessary (cid:22)but

not su(cid:30)ient(cid:22) ondition the true equation of motion must ful(cid:28)ll. The true equation of

motion, whih will not have neither preaeleration nor runaway solutions, is of seond

order and an only be onstruted by using a series expansion or a method of suessive

approximations.

Others [28℄ onsider that the ommented di(cid:30)ulties with Lorentz Dira equation

are not real physial problems, as they aept that aeleration an have a singularity

in points where the applied fore has a disontinuity.

None of these justi(cid:28)ations is fully satisfatory to us. Consider a lassial harge

modelled by a harge distribution and the orresponding energy-momentum distribution

inside a sphere of radius ǫ. Provided that a suitable set of onstitutive relations is

added, the loal onservation of energy-momentum yields an evolution law for this

ontinuous medium, whih is deterministi and ausal: the eletri urrent and the

energy-momentum distribution at t = 0 determine the future values of these magnitudes.

It is, to say the least, startling that, on taking the limit ǫ → 0, the ausal and

deterministi nature of the lassial problem is lost.

On the motion of a lassial harged partile

Apparently Lorentz-Dira equation is an unavoidable and (cid:29)awless onsequene of

lassial eletrodynamis plus the loal onservation of total energy and momentum

[7, 18, 26℄. However, as the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld ontribution to the energy-momentum

tensor is singular on the harge's worldline (cid:22)it behaves as Θµν ≈ O(r−4)(cid:22) some reative

(cid:16)triks(cid:17) are neessary to appropriately handle suh a singular behavior in the energy-

momentum balane. In our opinion, in most approahes to this problem some additional

assumption slips into the reasoning through one of these (cid:16)triks(cid:17).

In this ontext,

it is worth mentioning Rowe's work [21, 22℄, where more

elaborated mathematial tools, namely regularization of generalized funtions, are used

to properly handle the singularity in Θµν

and obtain the Lorentz-Dira equation. The

use of generalized funtions (or distributions) has also the advantage that no mass

renormalization is neessary.

We shall here use these same mathematial tools to review the derivation of

Lorentz-Dira equation and see that, ontrary to the ommon belief, it is not a straight

onsequene of lassial eletrodynamis plus energy-momentum onservation, but it

inludes an elementary extra assumption.

We shall here desribe a point harge as a urrent distribution in an extended

material body in the limit where the radius ǫ → 0. The total energy-momentum tensor

results from two ontributions: the eletromagneti part, Θµν

, whih is assoiated to the

(cid:28)eld and pervades spaetime, and the material part, K µν

, whih we assume on(cid:28)ned to

a world-tube of radius ǫ and aounts for kineti energy and the stresses that balane

the eletri repulsion among the parts of a neat total harge on(cid:28)ned in a small volume.

For ǫ > 0 both ontributions Θµν

and K µν

are ontinuous funtions and an be

onsidered separately. But in the limit ǫ → 0, the eletromagneti part presents a
singularity O(r−4) on the worldline. Therefore, in the limit ǫ → 0 none of these two

ontributions an be properly de(cid:28)ned, even resorting to generalized funtions. However,

nothing forbids the total energy-momentum tensor to onverge to a generalized funtion

for ǫ → 0, whih will likely inlude δ funtions and its derivatives on the point harge

worldline.

In our approah we do not need to assume that the involved funtions are analyti.

Although Taylor expansions to some (cid:28)nite order are used, these hold for funtions that

are smooth enough, without need of analytiity [4℄.

On the motion of a lassial harged partile

5

We shall examine what restritions on the harge's motion follow from loal

onservation of energy and momentum, and (cid:28)nd that the result is not Lorentz-Dira

equation but a somewhat less restritive equation, already derived by Honig and Szamosi

[11℄ by extending Dira's work. Then we shall see that this equation admits solutions

that are free of both preaeleration or runaways.

2. Statement of the problem

2.1. Notation

The retarded Liénard-Wiehert (cid:28)eld of a point harge has an outstanding role along

the present paper. Therefore it will be helpful to use retarded optial oordinates [25℄

(as in ref. [21℄) based on a timelike worldline Γ ≡ {zµ(τ )} and an orthonormal tetrad
{eµ

(α)}α=1,2,3,4 , whih is Fermi-Walker transported along Γ,

deµ
(α)
dτ

= [vµaν − vνaµ] eν

(α) .

With a properly hosen initial tetrad, the latter evolution equation is onsistent with

the onditions

eµ
(α)eν

(β)ηµν = ηαβ ,

eµ
(4) = vµ = ˙zµ

and

aµ = ˙vµ ,

where a `dot' means (cid:19)derivative with respet to τ (cid:20) and ηµν = (+ + +−). Moreover,

supplemented with x4 > z4(τ ), has always a unique solution, τ = τ (x), whih de(cid:28)nes a

from now on we use units suh that c = 1.

For any point x in spaetime, the equation

[xµ − zµ(τ )][xν − zν(τ )]ηµν = 0 ,

time oordinate for x.

The spae oordinates are

X i = eµ

(i) (xµ − zµ[τ (x)])

and the inverse oordinate transformation then reads

xµ = zµ(τ ) + ρvµ(τ ) + X ieµ

(i)(τ ) ,

where ρ = k ~Xk =

(X 1)2 + (X 2)2 + (X 3)2

The following relations and quantities, introdued in ref. [26℄, will be useful hereon:

ρ = −[xµ − zµ(τ )]vµ(τ ) ,

[xµ − zµ(τ )] ,

an be written as

nµ =

Finally, the relationship between the volume elements in Lorentzian and in retarded

2.2. Some de(cid:28)nitions and postulates

A point harge is desribed by a urrent density four-vetor, jµ

, and an energy-

momentum tensor, tµν

, ful(cid:28)lling

∂µjµ = 0 ,

∂µtµν = 0

and

tµν = tνµ ,

(10)

respetively, the loal onservation laws for total eletri harge, energy-momentum,

and angular momentum.

We expet to obtain jµ

and tµν

as the limit of ontinuous distributions of harge

and energy-momentum when the radius goes to zero, namely,

(a) an eletri urrent vetor J µ(ǫ; x), whih is on(cid:28)ned to an (cid:16)optial tube(cid:17) of radius

ǫ around a timelike worldline Γ, that is,

ρ(x) > ǫ ⇒ J µ(ǫ; x) = 0 ,

where ρ(x) is given by (7),

(b) an energy-momentum tensor T µν(ǫ; x) whih results from two ontributions:

T µν(ǫ; x) = Θµν(ǫ; x) + K µν(ǫ; x) .

The (cid:28)rst term omes from the total eletromagneti (cid:28)eld:

namely, the sum of the retarded solution of the Maxwell equations for the urrent

J µ(ǫ; x) plus an external free eletromagneti (cid:28)eld. The seond term in (12) omes

from the matter distribution whih is also on(cid:28)ned to the above mentioned (cid:16)optial

tube(cid:17):

ρ(x) > ǫ ⇒ K µν(ǫ; x) = 0 .

(14)

The above ontinuous distributions of eletri urrent and energy-momentum are

assumed to ful(cid:28)ll the loal onservation laws:

∂µJ µ = 0 ,

∂µT µν = 0 ,

T µν = T νµ .

We shall assume that both J µ(ǫ; x) and K µν(ǫ; x) are loally summable in
F µν

ext(x) is ontinuous in

R4

.

The retarded eletromagneti (cid:28)eld is given by [19℄

F µν

R (ǫ; x) =

8π
c Z

J [ν(ǫ; x)∂µ]DR(x − x′) d4x′

with

DR(x) =

and that

(16)

R4

[Y (x4) is the Heaviside step funtion.℄ The retarded eletromagneti (cid:28)eld is thus a

ontinuous funtion and therefore loally summable in

.

In its turn, the eletromagneti ontribution to the energy-momentum tensor,

Θµν(ǫ; x) =

F µα(ǫ; x) F ν

α(ǫ; x) −

ηµνF ρα(ǫ; x) Fρα(ǫ; x)

,

(cid:21)

(17)

1
4π (cid:20)

is also loally summable.

The framework where the limits for ǫ → 0 of J µ(ǫ; x) and T µν(ǫ; x) are
mathematially meaningful and an be appropriately handled is the spae D′(R4) of
generalized funtions [29, 8℄. As loally summable funtions, J µ(ǫ; x) and T µν(ǫ; x) an

be assoiated to generalized funtions and, provided that the limits

jµ = lim
ǫ→0

J µ(ǫ) ∈ D′(R4) ,

tµν = lim
ǫ→0

T µν(ǫ) ∈ D′(R4)

exist,

the ontinuity of di(cid:27)erentiation operators in D′(R4) [30℄ guarantees the

onservation laws (10) as the limit of (15) for ǫ → 0.

These onservation laws must now be understood in the sense of D′(R4), i. e.

∀ϕ ∈ D(R4) ,

(∂µjµ, ϕ) = 0

and

(∂µtµν, ϕ) = 0

On the motion of a lassial harged partile

or

(jµ, ∂µϕ) = 0

(tµν, ∂µϕ) = 0 .

and

(18)

3. The point harge limit

3.1. The eletri urrent

If the support of J µ(ǫ; x) is the (cid:16)optial tube(cid:17) ρ(x) ≤ ǫ, then for any ϕ ∈ D(R4) suh

that supp ϕ does not interset the worldline Γ, it exists ǫ1 > 0 suh that ϕ(x) = 0

whenever ρ(x) ≤ ǫ1 . Therefore, for all ǫ < ǫ1 ,

(J µ(ǫ), ϕ) =

d4x J µ(ǫ; x) ϕ(x) = 0 ,

Z

and in the limit ǫ → 0 it follows that

(jµ, ϕ) = 0 ,

∀ϕ ∈ D(R4)

suh that Γ ∩ supp ϕ = ∅ .

The support of the generalized funtion jµ

is therefore on(cid:28)ned to the worldline Γ

and, aording to a well known result on generalized funtions [31℄, jµ

an be written

as a sum of δ -funtions and its derivatives up to a (cid:28)nite order:

jµ =

dτ [lµ(τ ) δ(x − z(τ )) + lαµ(τ ) ∂αδ(x − z(τ )) + . . .

Z
+lα1...αnµ(τ ) ∂α1...αnδ(x − z(τ ))]

with l(α1...αr)µ vα1 = 0 ; r = 1, . . . n.

To model a point harge we only keep the lowest order term and, as a onsequene

of the onservation law (10), we have [26℄

jµ = e

dτ vµ(τ ) δ(x − z(τ )) ,

Z

where e is the eletri harge of the partile and is a onstant salar.

3.2. The energy-momentum tensor

In our approah, the limits for K µν(ǫ) and Θµν(ǫ) do not need to exist separately in
D′(R4). Our assumption is weaker and only the joint limit is assumed to be physially

meaningful:

tµν = lim
ǫ→0

[K µν(ǫ) + Θµν(ǫ)] ∈ D′(R4) .

(19)

(20)

(21)

On the motion of a lassial harged partile

9

This fat expresses the notion that, although in the separate limits for both K µν(ǫ) and

Θµν(ǫ) some in(cid:28)nities on the worldline Γ ould arise, these in(cid:28)nities will anel eah

other, so that tµν

is de(cid:28)ned in D′(R4).

3.2.1. The matter ontribution If we restrit to test funtions ϕ ∈ D(R4 − Γ), we have

that

K µν(ǫ) = 0 ∈ D′(R4 − Γ) .

lim
ǫ→0

Indeed, for any ϕ ∈ D(R4 − Γ) it exists ǫ1 > 0 suh that ϕ(x) = 0 whenever ρ(x) ≤ ǫ1 .

The on(cid:28)nement ondition (14) then implies that

∀ǫ < ǫ1 ,

(K µν(ǫ), ϕ) =

d4x K µν(ǫ; x) ϕ(x) = 0

Z

and equation (22) follows [32℄.

3.2.2. The eletromagneti ontribution Reall now equations (16) and (17). We have

the pointwise limit

F µν(ǫ; x) = F µν

R (x) + F µν

ext(x) ,

lim
ǫ→0

where F µν

R (x) is the retarded Liénard-Wiehert (cid:28)eld, and is de(cid:28)ned whenever x /∈ Γ. It

an be written as the sum of the radiation (cid:28)eld plus the veloity (cid:28)eld:

where, in the notation introdued in subsetion 2.1 (also in ref. [26℄):

F µν

(Here (ak) ≡ aλkλ .) Similarly, for the eletromagneti energy-momentum tensor we

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

have the pointwise onvergene:

Θµν(ǫ; x) = Θµν(x) ,

lim
ǫ→0

exept at the points x ∈ Γ.

As a onsequene of (23), Θµν(x) an be splitted as

and ρ−3

Owing to the ρ−4

singularities on the r.h.s. of the above expression, not

R (x) has a singularity on Γ, but in addition it is not loally summable. Therefore,

only Θµν
no generalized funtion in D′(R4) an be assoiated to Θµν

R (x) in the standard way.
R4 − Γ, it is loally summable there,

Now, sine Θµν

R (x) is a ontinuous funtion on

and this allows to take its (cid:28)nite part θµν

R ∈ D′(R4) [33, 9℄:

(θµν

R , ϕ) ≡

d4x Θµν

R (x) [ϕ(x) − Y (L − ρ) [ϕ(z) + ρkα∂αϕ(z)]]

for any ϕ ∈ D′(R4), where L is an arbitrary hosen length sale, z = z(τ (x)) and τ (x),
kα

and ρ(x) are de(cid:28)ned in (7).

Some points onerning the de(cid:28)nition (30) are worth to omment:

(i) The integral in the r.h.s. onverges. Indeed, on the one hand, for ρ > L, Θµν

R (x) is
ontinuous and ϕ(x) has ompat support and, on the other, inside ρ ≤ L we an

use the mean value Taylor theorem [4℄ for the smooth funtion ϕ:

ϕ(x) = ϕ(z) + ρkλ∂λϕ(z) +

ρ2kλkµ∂λµϕ(z + ρ′k)

Hene the integrand in the r.h.s. of (30) presents a singularity of order ρ−2

on Γ

and therefore the integral onverges.

(ii) For a test funtion ϕ ∈ D(R4 − Γ), the funtion and all its derivatives vanish on Γ.

(iii) The de(cid:28)nition (30) onsists of eliminating from the integrand as many terms in

the Taylor expansion of ϕ(x) as neessary, in suh a way that the remainder is

summable and the ondition (ii) above is ful(cid:28)lled. As a onsequene, the (cid:28)nite part

θµν
R ∈ D′(R4) is not unique. Indeed, on the one hand, we ould have substrated
some more terms in the Taylor expansion of ϕ, and obtained a onvergent integral

also ful(cid:28)lling the requierement (ii). Besides, the length sale L is quite arbitrary

and ould even depend on τ (x).
This results in that θµν

R is determined up to a (cid:28)nite sum of Γ-supported δ -
funtions and their derivatives, multiplied by arbitrary τ -dependent oe(cid:30)ients,

in an expression similar to (19). We shall see that this lak of uniqueness in the

de(cid:28)nition of θµν

We shall hereafter write

Notie that θµν ∈ D′(R4) ⊂ D′(R4 − Γ) . Now, sine Θµν(x) is loally summable in
R4 − Γ, it an be onsidered as a generalized funtion Θµν ∈ D′(R4 − Γ) and, as a

onsequene of (31) we have that

θµν = Θµν

in

D′(R4 − Γ) .

3.2.3. The total energy-momentum tensor The total energy-momentum tensor tµν
de(cid:28)ned by the limit (21). For any test funtion ϕ ∈ D(R4 −Γ) we have, as a onsequene

is

of (22), that

(tµν, ϕ) = lim

d4x Θµν(ǫ, x) ϕ(x)

and, using (27), (31) and (37), we obtain

(tµν, ϕ) = (θµν, ϕ) ,

∀ϕ ∈ D(R4 − Γ) .

Therefore, tµν − θµν ∈ D′(R4) has support on Γ and, aording to a well known result

[31℄, it an be written as a (cid:28)nite sum:

tµν − θµν =

dτ [mµν(τ ) δ(x − z(τ )) + mαµν(τ ) ∂αδ(x − z(τ )) + . . .

r = 1 . . . n .

So far there is no orrespondene between tµν − θµν

and the, so to speak, (cid:16)matter

ontribution(cid:17) to the energy and momentum. Therefore, we are not obliged to assign

dτ vµvν δ(x − z(τ )), as it is done in ref. [21, 22℄. However,

as possible, namely,

pµν = mµν + ˙U µν − V µν ,

pλµν = mλµν + U λµν ,

where, pλµνvλ = 0 as it obviously follows from (36) and (38).

4. Conservation laws and equations of motion

The loal onservation laws (10) will then yield some restritions on the oe(cid:30)ients pµν

and pλµν

[14, 10℄. First of all, the symmetry of tµν

implies that

pµν = pνµ ,

pλµν = pλνµ .

Now, it is helpful to separate these oe(cid:30)ients in their omponents respetively parallel

and orthogonal to the veloity vµ

:

pµν = Mvµvν + pµvν + pνvµ + pµν
⊥ ,
pλµν = Qλvµvν + Qλµvν + Qλνvµ + Qλµν ,






where all tensors and vetors other than vµ

are orthogonal to the veloity. The loal

onservation law (10) then implies that

∂µ ˆθµν

R + ∂µθµν

ext + ∂µθµν

mix + ∂µtµν

s = 0 .

Now, sine θµν

ext is the energy-momentum tensor of a free eletromagneti (cid:28)eld, ∂µθµν

ext = 0.

that

and

Qλµν = 0 .

On the basis of solely the onservations of energy-momentum and angular

momentum we have thus found that

(a) the quantities M, Qλ . . . , Qλµν

ten independent partile variables: M , Qλ

and Q[λµ]

, that,

in equations (41) an be written in terms of only

(b) together with the worldline variables zµ(τ ), vµ(τ ), . . . are sub jet to the di(cid:27)erential

system (54)(cid:21)(55).

4.1. Total momentum and angular momentum

Next, to have a lue of the physial meaning of M , Qλ

and Qλν

, we examine the total

linear and angular momenta.

The total linear momentum ontained in the hypersurfae Γ ≡ {τ = constant} in

the optial oordinates (6), i. e. the future light one with vertex in zµ(τ ), is

P µ(τ ) =

dΣν tµν

with

dΣν = −kν d3 ~X .

(56)

ZΓ

Inluding now (39), we have that the total momentum P µ

results from three

ontributions:

where P µ
term θµν

P µ = P µ

p + P µ

mix + P µ

mix and P µ

ext respetively ome from the ross term θµν

mix and the external (cid:28)eld

ext in the energy-momentum tensor, and

P µ

p = −

d3 ~X kν(tµν

s + θµν
R )

ZΓ

is the ontribution from the harge, i. e. the harge and its inseparable self-(cid:28)eld.

On substituting (33), (29), (40) and (41) into (57), after a little alulation we

obtain

p = Mvµ − ˙Qµ +
P µ

aλ(Qλvµ + Qλµ) .

Similarly, the total angular momentum in the hypersurfae Γ,

J µν(τ ) = −

d3 ~X kσ (xµtνσ − xνtµσ) ,

ZΓ

omes from three ontributions as well: J µν = J µν

p + J µν

mix + J µν

ext . A similar alulation

yields the point harge ontribution

p = zµP ν
J µν

p − zνP µ

p + Sµν
p ,

where

p = −2Q[µvν] − 2Q[µν]
Sµν

is the partile internal angular momentum. The seond term on the r. h.

s.

is

orthogonal to the veloity and is the spin of the partile. On its turn, the possibility

that Qµ ≡ −vνSµν
p

6= 0 is related with the fat that the enter of motion [10℄ does not

neessarily lies on the partile's worldline.

To model a spinless harge, we hoose Qµν = 0. Equation (54) then yields

Qµ = Qaµ

and (55) an be further simpli(cid:28)ed to:

This agrees with the equation obtained by Honig and Szamosi: (61) is equation (7)

in [11℄, with m = M + 2Qa2 − ¨Q, R = 2 ˙Q and S = Q. Lorentz-Dira equation is a

The salar variables M and Q, together with the worldline zµ(τ ) are sub jet to equation

(61), whih has been derived on the only basis that linear and angular momenta are

onserved, supplemented with the point limit and the assumption that the partile is

spinless.

5. The equation of motion

Equation (61) does not yield the law of motion yet. Indeed, it onsists of four equations

for (cid:28)ve unknowns, namely, M , Q and zµ

with the onstraint vµvµ = −1. The motion of

the partile is therefore underdetermined.

This should not be surprising. The problem in dynamis of ontinuous media for

ǫ > 0, as we have posed it, is itself underdetermined, beause no onstitutive equation

has been assumed for the material sustaining the eletri harge, ontrary, for instane,

to what is done in [34, 15℄, were it is assumed that the harge is rigidly distributed over

a spherial shell of radius ǫ.

Instead of advaning a matter onstitutive equation for ǫ > 0, then reexamining

the problem and taking the limit ǫ → 0 to determine a (cid:28)nal equation of motion, we

shall diretly posit a onstitutive relation onneting M , Q and the worldline invariants

(urvature, torsion, et.).

Notie that, although it is the simplest hoie and looks suitable for an elementary

harge, a presription like Q = 0 is not an appropriate onstitutive relation. Indeed,

with a hoie like this, (61) beomes Lorentz-Dira equation whih leads to the dilemma

of solutions that are either preaelerated or runaway.

We shall base our guess of a onstitutive relation on the requirements that

(a) it onnets M , Q, aν

and maybe some of their derivatives,

(b) when aν

, Q and also their derivatives vanish, then M = m0 , and

() if the point harge is ated by an external fore F ν

that vanishes for τ < 0 and for

τ > τ1 , then:

• aν(τ ) = 0, M(τ ) = m0 and Q(τ ) = 0 for τ < 0 and

On the motion of a lassial harged partile

18

• aν → 0, M → m0 and Qaν → 0 asymptotially in the future.

(The proper mass has the same value m0 in the in(cid:28)nite past and future, beause we are

assuming that the partile (cid:16)identity(cid:17) is (cid:28)nally preserved.)

5.1. Retilinear motion

To see whether a onstitutive relation an be presribed so that (61) admits solutions

that are neither runaway nor preaelerated, we shall examine the ase of retilinear

motion. (Reall that even in this simple ase Lorentz-Dira equation is not satisfatory.)

Consider a point harge that initially is unaelerated and free. Then, during the

interval 0 ≤ τ ≤ τ1 , it is ated by an external fore in a onstant diretion along the X 1
axis. The harge worldline will remain in the plane X 1X 4

in spaetime and therefore,

dvµ

= a ˆaµ

and

= ˙a ˆaµ + a2 vµ ,

where ˆaµ

is the unit vetor parallel to aµ

oe(cid:30)ients pµν

and pλµν

the energy-momentum tensor are

, i. e. the (cid:28)rst normal to the worldline. The

in equations (62) and (63), i. e. the partile's ontribution to

pλµν = qˆaλvµvν ,

Qλ = Qaλ ,

pµν = M vµvν − ˙q (ˆaµvν + ˆaνvµ) + qa ˆaµˆaν ,

with q ≡ Qa.

These two equations must be supplemented with a onstitutive relation M =

M(a, q, ˙q) in order that evolution is determined. The phase spae is therefore

oordinated by (a, q, ˙q).

We would expet that while the harge is not ated by any fore, F (τ ) = 0,

−∞ < τ < 0, then it remains in a state of uniform retilinear motion and the energy-

momentum tensor is the one orresponding to a free partile together with its Coulomb

(cid:28)eld, i. e. equations (39), (62) and (63) with

a(τ ) = 0 ,

M(τ ) = m0 ,

q(τ ) = ˙q(τ ) = 0 ,

If an external fore is then swithed on: F (τ ) 6= 0, 0 ≤ τ < τ1 , then a, M , q and ˙q

evolve aording to (66) with the initial data inferred from (67) and the ontinuity of

the orbit in phase spae. This determines

a(τ ) ,

M(τ ) ,

q(τ )

and

˙q(τ )

for 0 < τ < τ1

(68)

After that the partile is not ated by a fore any more and what we would expet is

that it asymptotially tends towards a free state, i. e.

a(τ ) → 0 ,

M(τ ) → m0 ,

q(τ ) → 0 ,

˙q(τ ) → 0

for

τ → ∞

(with the same asymptotial value m0 for the mass, in order that the partile's (cid:16)identity(cid:17)

is preserved).

A way to ahieve this behaviour onsists in that the dynamial system (66)

supplemented with the onstitutive relation has only one equilibrium point for a =

q = ˙q = 0, whih is asymptotially stable and M(0, 0, 0) = m0 .

5.2. A dynamial system

Using the onstant τ0 ≡

2e2
3m0

, we introdue the new dimensionless variables

t ≡

τ
τ0

,

1 + µ ≡

M + qa
m0

,

α ≡ a τ0 ,

ρ ≡

(69)

q
m0τ0

and redue (66) with F = 0 to the simpler equivalent system

µ′ = aρ′ ,

ρ′′ + α′ = α(1 + µ) ,

µ = µ(α, ρ, ρ′) ,

where `prime' means (cid:19)derivative with respet to t(cid:20).

Then, by di(cid:27)erentiating the onstitutive relation and introduing the variable

x ≡ ρ′ + α, we obtain

(70)

where

A(α, ρ, x) ≡

[(x − α)(α − µρ) − αµx(1 + µ)].

This dynamial system is already in normal form and is de(cid:28)ned in the entire phase

spae provided that the funtion A(α, ρ, x) has no singularities. Partiularly, if we hoose

µ so that is a solution of

A0(α, ρ, x) µα + (x − α) µρ + α (1 + µ) µx = α(x − α)

(71)

ρ′ = x − α ,
x′ = α(1 + µ) ,
α′ = A(α, ρ, x) ,

Moreover, the onstants l, p and r an be hosen so that the harateristi equation at

PI ,

X 3 − lX 2 + (p − r)X − p = 0 ,

has three negative solutions and hene PI is an asymptotially stable equilibrium point.

In Appendix B [equation (81)℄ we see how a solution µ = µ(α, ρ, x) of equation (71)

that vanishes at PI = (0, 0, 0) an be perturbatively obtained and is valid at least in a

neigbourhood of this phase point.

Now, (69) an be used to obtain the onstitutive equation

(73)

This, together with equations (66), determines a motion of the harge that is free of

both preaeleration and runaways, provided that the fore F ats only during a (cid:28)nite

interval of time.

Indeed, if the harge is unaelerated in past in(cid:28)nity it remains so

until its state is altered beause F has started to at. Then, when the fore eases, the

harge tends to the asymptotially stable equilibrium point a = 0, q = ˙q = 0, at least if

the system was lose enough when the fore dissapeared.

6. Conlusion

By studying the energy-momentum balane of a lassial point harge with the

eletromagneti (cid:28)eld, we have obtained that

(a) the total energy-momentum tensor onsists of (i) a regular part, whih omes from

the external (cid:28)eld ontribution plus the regularization of the self-(cid:28)eld ontribution,

and (ii) a singular part, with support on the harge worldline.

On the motion of a lassial harged partile

21

(b) This singular part depends on two salar oe(cid:30)ients M(τ ) and Q(τ ) and on the

worldline variables vµ(τ ), aµ(τ ), . . .

() These variables are onstrained to ful(cid:28)ll the Honig-Szamosi equation [11℄, i. e. (61).

Lorentz-Dira equation is obtained only if the onstitutive relation Q = 0 is set by

hand. The well known troubles that su(cid:27)ers the Lorentz-Dira equation are due to this

bad hoie rather than to energy-momentum onservation itself.

We have then seen that, at least in the ase of retilinear motion, it is possible to

(cid:28)nd a onstitutive relation M = M(a, Q, ˙Q) whih, together with equation (61) yields

an equation of motion for the point harge that is free from both preaeleration and

runaways. That is, if a harge is initially at rest, with proper mass m0 , and is ated by

an external fore whih lasts only a (cid:28)nite interval of time, then there is no aeleration

before the fore starts and, when its ation eases, the motion tends asymptotially to

be retilinear uniform and the proper mass tends to m0 .

We have to solve equation (71)

(78)

with the (cid:16)initial ondition(cid:17) µ(0, 0, 0) = 0.

being a polynomial in the variables a, q, x whih is homogeneous and has degree 2n.

then equation (78) yields the hierarhy:

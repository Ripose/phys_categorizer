Comment on “Gauge transformations are
Canonical transformations”

Abstract

We comment on the work of Tai L Chow, Eur. J. Phys. 18, 467 (1997).
By considering the Lagrangians which are uniquely deﬁned only to within
an additive total time derivative of a function of co-ordinates and time the
author has tried to show that the gauge transformations which relate these
Lagrangians are canonical transformations. He has obtained the right con-
clusion only by using wrong canonical equations and the entire exercise has
hence become erroneous and inconclusive. By using the deﬁnition of canon-
ical transformation through Poisson brackets we prove that the above gauge
transformations are canonical transformations.

We refer here to the letter by Chow [1] in which the author has tried
to show that the gauge transformations relating the Lagrangians diﬀer by a
total time derivative of arbitrary function of coordinate and time are in fact
canonical. The approach however is misleading. The author has obtained
the right conclusion only by using wrong canonical equations [ see the last
two equations of [1]] and the entire exercise has hence become erroneous and
inconclusive. In this letter we give a complete proof that the gauge trans-
formations are canonical transformations by using the deﬁnition of canonical
transformations in terms of Poisson brackets.

The transformation (pi, qi) −→ (Pi, Qi) is canonical iﬀ the following

Poisson Brackets are satisﬁed

[Pi, Pk]q,p = 0 = [Qi, Qk]q,p; & [Qi, Pk]q,p = δik.

(1)

To calculate these Poisson Brackets we consider the Hamiltonians corre-
sponding to L(qi, ˙qi, t) and L′(qi, ˙qi, t) deﬁned through Legendre transfor-
mations

Now we to show, the transformation (pi, qi) −→ (Pi, Qi) is canonical all
we need to show that the transformed canonical variables, (Pi, Qi) satisfy the
Poisson brackets listed in Eq. (1).

In conclusion, we have shown that the gauge transformations which con-
nect the Lagrangians diﬀer by a total time derivative of co-ordinate and time
are canonical. We have pointed out that approach of ref.
[1] is erroneous
and inconclusive.

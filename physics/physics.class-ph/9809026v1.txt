Abstract

An accelerated classical point charge radiates at the Larmor power rate
2e2a2/3, leading to the expectation of an associated radiation reaction force.
The famous Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac proposal is plagued with diﬃculties.
Here we note a simple, amazing, and apparently overlooked fact: an accel-
erated charge is also always absorbing power at exactly the Larmor rate.
Implications for radiation reaction and the particle motion are considered.
Our analysis supports Kijowski’s recent proposal.

Particles and ﬁelds are central concepts in modern physics. The idea of particles inter-
acting through ﬁelds is a key paradigm. Its roots are classical, primarily in electrodynamics
where Faraday’s ﬁeld idea replaced Newton’s “action at a distance”. Classical point charges
interact locally with the electromagnetic ﬁeld via the Lorentz force law ˙p = F = e(E+v×B).
This relation, essentially the genesis of the ﬁeld idea, both deﬁnes the electromagnetic ﬁeld
and predicts the particle motion—with the exception of self interaction eﬀects.

From Maxwell’s ﬁeld equations it was found that an accelerating classical point charge
radiates power at the Larmor rate. Since the particle apparently looses energy, one expects
an associated radiation reaction (damping, friction) force. For over a century many famous
physicists struggled with this idea and various associated models for classical particles. The
best known reaction force proposal was developed, based on an extended charge model, by
Lorentz. Later Dirac gave a derivation of the relativistic version for point particles using
the conservation laws. However, the equation of motion, with this radiation reaction force
included, has been plagued with numerous diﬃculties. Here we note a very relevant, simple,
amazing fact, which has apparently been overlooked for over 100 years: an accelerated
point charge is also always absorbing power at exactly the Larmor rate.
Implications for
radiation reaction and the particle motion are considered. Our analysis supports Kijowski’s
“renormalized electrodynamics”.

Maxwell’s equations [1–3] (we take c = 1), ∂µF νµ = 4πJ ν with Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ, in
the Lorenz gauge ∂µAµ = 0, lead to the wave equation ∂µ∂µAν = −4πJ ν for the potentials.
A solution can be written in terms of the potentials obtained via the retarded or advanced
Green function along with an associated solution to the homogeneous equation: Aµ =

include two types of terms. One, proportional to vµ, is of the Coulomb ∼ e/R2 form and
is bound to the charge, moving along with it. The other, proportional to the acceleration
aµ := dvµ/dτ , is long range, having 1/R fall oﬀ; it is interpreted as radiation which escapes
from the charge. In the charge’s instantaneous rest frame, in vector notation, B = [ ˆR × E],

This splitting (based on the retarded/advanced decomposition) however, although intuitively
appealing, is really not physical, for ∇·Eacl = (2e/R2)a· ˆR 6= 0 outside of the moving charge.
Hence Eacl, taken by itself, appears to have conjured out of the vacuum a rather strange
source charge density—the associated 4-current is proportional to Rµ and is thus moving at
the speed of light [4]. However the “acceleration” ﬁelds really do, through the O(R−2) part

the celebrated Larmor power formula. Note however, that this calculation is valid only if
there are no other ﬁelds that interfere with the radiation. Real charges are actually immersed
in a sea of electromagnetic ﬁelds ranging from the 3 K cosmological microwave radiation
thorough the output of the sun and stars to radio, television and thermal radiation at ∼ 300
K.

In practice one cannot measure the radiation at inﬁnity. Since the radiation rate is
proportional to the instantaneous acceleration of the particle, it is inferred that any accel-
erating charge emits radiation. Rohrlich has rigorously established this as a local criterion
for radiation [5,3]. Hence our view is that the emission of “radiation” is a local process
happening near the charge. An accelerating charge causes a certain type of disturbance of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld in its immediate neighborhood. This disturbance may propagate
out to large distances. Instead it may suﬀer interference from other eﬀects propagating in
the ﬁeld, so that little or no power may actually get out to inﬁnity; but this is a vacuum
ﬁeld propagation issue; it should not be held to the charged particle’s account. Note that,
because of interference, an outward propagating signal does not conserve power in general.
The usual dogma is that the emission of radiation is irreversible and hence there is an
associated radiation damping (or friction).
If power is emitted then energy conservation
considerations lead to a radiation reaction force. The orthodox version is the Abraham-
Lorentz-Dirac force [1–3,6–8]. A simple argument (see, e.g., Jackson [2] §17.2) considers the

Under certain conditions the ﬁrst term on the rhs will vanish (e.g., if the motion is periodic

As Jackson says: “It can be considered as an equation which includes in some approximate
and time averaged way the reactive eﬀects of the emission of radiation”. But many regard
this equation (or its relativistic generalization) as fundamental (see e.g., [3–6,9,10]). Wheeler
and Feynman [7] observed that: “The existence of this force of radiative reaction is well
attested: (a) by the electrical potential required to drive a wireless antenna; (b) by the loss of
energy experienced by a charged particle which has been deﬂected, and therefore accelerated,
in its passage near an atomic nucleus; and (c) by the cooling of a glowing body.” But each of
these processes has its converse, for example a wireless receiver can absorb power and a cool
object can absorb heat radiation. Microscopically, the interactions of classical physics were
presumed to be time reversible. If a charge could emit radiation it could likewise, under
In classical physics the asymmetry
appropriately reversed conditions, absorb radiation.

between past and future is only a macroscopic statistical eﬀect, certain processes are regarded
as being much more probable. And so it should be with electrodynamics. Indeed Wheeler
and Feynman [7] attest: “We have to conclude with Einstein11 [citation in the original]
that the irreversibility of the emission process is a phenomenon of statistical mechanics
connected with the asymmetry of the initial conditions with respect to time.” Our usual
physical intuition accepts an accelerated charge emitting power, readily imagining outgoing
waves carrying away energy, but regards power absorption as uncommon, imagining it quite
unlikely that waves will be prearranged to focus on a charge. We will show that this picture
of power absorption is inaccurate.

Although power absorption situations are actually physically common, power absorption
by accelerating charges is rarely mentioned (except in connection with the direct interaction
theory [7] where its role is equally as important as emission.). However, the point we wish
to make here is not just that a charge could absorb power but that an accelerated charge
must constantly be absorbing at the same (Larmor) rate as it is emitting.

Including the aforementioned radiation damping force leads to the famous Abraham-
Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) equation for a moving point charge [6,1–3], which has been plagued
with problems. Brieﬂy, the ALD equation (i) is a 3rd order equation, (ii) seems to violate
time reversiblity, (ii) has runaway solutions, (iii) has “unphysical”, nonexistent, nonunique
and counter intuitive solutions, (iv) violates causality (preacceleration—for an ingenious
resolution see [11]). Much research has been devoted to these problems [8], occasionally the
controversy has become heated [10]. Dissatisfaction with the ALD has led to many ingenious
proposals (see, e.g., [8,12,13]). In our opinion most of the discussions overlook, or at best do
not give enough weight to, certain fundamental principles of classical physical interactions:
1. they are time reversible (QED is also time reversible): not only does every emission
situation have a corresponding absorption situation, microscopically they are on par and any
diﬀerence in rate is a consequence of a global asymmetric boundary condition (as Wheeler,
Feynman and Einstein believed) [14].

2. they have 2 initial data per degree of freedom: by this reckoning the ALD has 9/2

3. they are local and instantaneous: an inﬂuential text states “physics is simple when

analyzed locally” [15].

To establish our point about absorption, let us ﬁrst consider Born’s solution [16,17,3] for
a uniformly accelerating charge. The path is hyperbolic: x = 0, y = 0, z = (α2 + t2)1/2. The
ﬁeld, in cylindrical coordinates, is given by Eφ = Bρ = Bz = 0, and
Eρ = 8eα2ρz/ξ3,

Bφ = 8eα2ρt/ξ3,
Ez = −4eα

, where α = a−1. Note that E is time symmetric,
with ξ = {4α2ρ2 + (α2 + t2 − ρ2 − z2)2}
and B is time antisymmetric. Note also that the solution has a boost Lorentz symmetry:
the ﬁeld values at a later proper time are just obtained by Lorentz transforming between
the respective instantaneous inertial rest frames. Thus all times are essentially equivalent.
Without loss of generality we can examine the ﬁelds in the frame in which the charge is at
rest at the lab time t = 0.

It has been noted that S vanishes at t = 0, since B vanishes at that instant. Pauli [18],
in particular, has interpreted this fact to mean that a uniformly accelerated charge does

not radiate. However, it has been argued (see, e.g., [3] §5.3) that for radiation we should
look along the null cone. With z = α + ζ, calculating on the null cone, t2 = r2 := ρ2 + ζ 2,
of the point where the charge is at rest at lab time t = 0, we ﬁnd Eρ = eρ(1 + aζ)/r3,
Ez = e(ζ + aζ 2 − ar2)/r3, Bφ = eaρt/r3. Hence S · ˆrr2 = (t/4πr)e2a2 sin2 θ, which yields,
after integration over angles with t = +r, the expected Larmor rate, P = (2/3)e2a2/c3,
for the power radiated along the outgoing null cone (independent of r in this case). But,
calculating the power ﬂowing into the charge along the incoming null cone of the same point,
−t = r ≥ 0, gives the negative of the standard Larmor rate! The emitted power is just the
absorbed power. Apparently power has come from outside and has simply ﬂowed through
the location of the charge to be reemitted.

Note that in [5] this solution was derived using only the retarded interaction, so that
all ﬁelds in the region t + z > 0 should have come from the charge. But we have radiation
incoming from the past (tracing it back we ﬁnd that it comes from outside the region
t + z > 0) converging on the charge. Where did the power come from? We observe that
eternal acceleration is not physically realistic. Power ﬂowing into a charge which began
accelerating only one second ago could not be traced far back along the incoming null cone
(propagation of power along the null cone is not conserved).

For uniform acceleration the power absorption exactly equals the Larmor emission rate,
which depends only on the acceleration. Tracing the radiation along the null cone suggests
that even for a non-uniformly accelerated particle the rates would still be equal and would
depend only on the instantaneous acceleration. To establish this result, we consider the
the behavior of the instantaneous ﬁelds near a charge undergoing a general acceleration. In
addition to a regular part they include singular parts. The electric ﬁeld, Esing = E−2 +
E−1 + E0, includes the unbounded for r → 0 terms

as well as E0 = 3e/8{(a · ˆr)2ˆr + 2a · ˆra − a2ˆr}. The latter, like Bsing = B0 = −(e/2) ˙a × ˆr, is
bounded but still singular: the limiting value depends on the direction of approach for r → 0.
(It is easily checked that B0, E0 and E−1 have vanishing divergence while ∇·E−2 = 4πδ3(r).)
These expressions can be obtained from the 4-covariant instantaneous expression (which
played an important role in Dirac’s seminal paper, [6] eq. (60), and Rohrlich’s book, [3]
eq. (6-68)) or by specializing the more general expression given by Page way back in 1918
[19], eqs. (23,24). (It is amazing that so much of the signiﬁcance of these expressions was
not appreciated until the recent work of Kijowski [20].) These singular self ﬁeld values
are in general superposed with some regular solution to the homogeneous equation. The
regular parts of the ﬁelds at the location of the charge are just given by some constant
values. The particular form of Ereg(0) (and Breg(0)) is determined by various mathemat-
ical/physical choices like the Green function and boundary conditions: in particular using
the retarded/advanced Green function along with Ein/out = 0, gives Ereg(0) = ∓(2e/3) ˙a.
Thus the only well deﬁned part of the electric ﬁeld at the location of the particle in its
instantaneous rest frame, Ereg(0), has some deﬁnite value which is ultimately determined
(via the Maxwell equations) by the ﬁelds, particles and boundary conditions elsewhere.

We are now set to establish our general conclusion: that accelerated charges constantly
emit and absorb power at the Larmor rate. The key is the singular expansion of the ﬁeld
near the charge. Working in the reference frame in which the charge is instantaneously at

rest at t = 0, we calculate (to ﬁrst order is suﬃcient) the Poynting vector: S = (1/4π)E ×B,
using E(t, r) = E(0, r) + ˙E(0, r)t, along with ˙E(0, r) = ∇ × B(0, r), and similar equations
for B(t, r). The power is determined by the ﬂux integral of S · ˆr. The contribution in the
small r limit is just the O(1/r2) part. To suﬃcient accuracy,

r2ˆr · E × B ≃ r2ˆr · (E−2 + E−1 + E0 + ∇ × B0t) × {B0 − ∇ × (E−2 + E−1 + E0)t}
≡ r2ˆr · (E−1 + E0 + ∇ × B0t) × {B0 − ∇ × (E−1 + E0)t} .

Then integration over angles gives (2/3)e2a2(t/r), the Larmor power rate multiplied by t/r.
This factor is +1 for the outgoing future null cone, the usual emission but, for t < 0, the
factor is −1, indicating absorption of power incoming along the past null cone. Doing the
calculation in this fashion reveals that the result actually depends only on E−1, the a/r part
of the electric ﬁeld, which is independent of the choice of advanced or retarded potential.
Now that the physics is clear, we could do a rigourous covariant calculation. The details
need not be given here, it is suﬃcient to take Rohrlich’s establishment of the local criterion
[5] for the emitted power and time reverse it, replacing retarded by advanced quantities, to
ﬁnd exactly the same rate for the absorbed power.

Thus an accelerated charge always emits and absorbs at the Larmor rate locally. There
is a continuous stream of power at the Larmor rate through the location of the charge, not
a ﬂow from the charge to the ﬁeld. The charge seems merely to focus the ambient ﬁeld
ﬂow. Such a vision undermines the usual argument for a radiation reaction force based on
irreversible emission.

How then should a charge move? Our detailed considerations will be presented elsewhere.
Brieﬂy, we expect that a point charge would move according to some suitably adjusted
version of the Lorentz force law. The “physics is simple when analyzed locally” philosophy
is most easily applied in the instantaneous rest frame of the charge. There the Lorentz force
law reduces to the form Fem = eE. The complication is that E includes a singular part
due to the charge’s self ﬁeld, which does not have a well deﬁned value at the location of the
charge. The simplest, most obvious assumption is just to remove these singular terms [21].
Hence we propose that an instantaneously stationary point charged particle interacts with
the only well deﬁned part of the electric ﬁeld at the charge location: Ereg := E − Esing.
(Indeed, is there any other option that makes sense?) This renormalized Lorentz force

Fem = eEreg(0),

(10)

has, in eﬀect, already been proposed by Kijowski [20]. He took a diﬀerent approach proposing
certain boundary conditions on the ﬁeld at the location of the particle. He showed that
the Maxwell equations then preserved a suitably “renormalized” (by extracting the inﬁnite
Coulomb energy) expression for the total energy-momentum of the particle-electromagnetic

ﬁeld system. More recently the initial value problem for this “renormalized electrodynamics”
for point charged particles has been considered [22]. It was found that unique solutions exist,
there are no runaway solutions.

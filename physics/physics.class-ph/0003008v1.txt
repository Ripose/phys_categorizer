Abstract

This paper presents an intuitive, geometrical derivation of the relativistic

addition of velocities, and of the electromagnetic interaction between two uni-

formly moving charged particles, based on 2 spatial + 1 temporal dimensional

Minkowski diagrams. We calculate the relativistic addition of velocities by

projecting the world-line of the particle on the spatio-temporal planes of the

reference frames considered. We calculate the real component of the electro-

magnetic 4-force, in the proper reference frame of the source particle, starting

from the Coulomb force generated by a charged particle at rest. We then

obtain the imaginary component of the 4-force, in the same reference frame,

from the requirement that the 4-force be orthogonal to the 4-velocity. The

4-force is then projected on a real 3 dimensional space to get the Lorentz

force.

Special Relativity, as presented in today’s textbooks, is a complex mathematical theory.

The 1 spatial + 1 temporal dimensional Minkowski diagrams , which initially introduce

the Lorentz transformation, the time dilatation and the length contraction, are soon put

aside in favor of an approach based on diﬀerential calculus and linear algebra. One gets

1

little intuitive understanding of the law of relativistic addition of velocities, and of the

fact that ”magnetism is a kind of ’second-order’ eﬀect arising from relativistic changes

in the electric ﬁelds of moving charges” [1]. However, by introducing only slightly more

elaborate Minkowski diagrams, and using geometrical derivations, one can get back the

intuitive understanding, to the great delight of the physicist who still believes in the spirit

of Descartes’ philosophy.

II. REAL PLANE AND COMPLEX PLANE: SAME TRIGONOMETRY

The complex plane, like the real plane, is a two-dimensional (2D) vector space. The

scalar products for the real plane (1) and for the complex plane (2) are deﬁned as follows

ˆx · ˆx = 1

ˆy · ˆy = 1

ˆx · ˆy = ˆy · ˆx = 0

ˆx · ˆx = 1

ˆi · ˆi = −1

ˆx · ˆi = ˆi · ˆx = 0

(1)

(2)

where ˆx,ˆy and respectively ˆx,ˆi are the basis vectors.

Since both planes have a scalar product, one can talk about orthogonal vectors (their

scalar product is zero) and about the magnitude of a vector (the square root of the scalar

product of a vector with itself). This allows us to deﬁne the circle (the geometric locus of

the points equally spaced from a given point), the angle in radians (the length, between two

points of a circle of radius one, measured along the circumference), and the trigonometric

functions sine and cosine (the magnitudes of the projections of a radius one vector on the two

coordinate axes). From these deﬁnitions it follows that, for both the real and the complex

planes, one has the relations:

sin2(α) + cos2(α) = 1

cos(α)]2 = 1.

[

d
dα

sin(α)]2 + [

d
dα

2

(3)

(4)

From (3)-(4) one can get the derivatives of the trigonometric functions, the Taylor series

expansions of sine and cosine, and then all the well known trigonometric relations. The

only detail we have to keep in mind is that the angle α in the real plane is a real number,

while in the complex plane it is a purely imaginary number, due to the non-positive deﬁnite

scalar product used in the last case. There are a few more relevant diﬀerences, which we

can best point out if we represent the complex plane as an Euclidean plane. Two vectors

in the complex plane are orthogonal if they make the same angle with the bisecting line of

the ﬁrst quadrant. The circle in the complex plane looks like a hyperbola [2]. Not any line

passing through the origin intersects the right (or left) branch of the hyperbola. This means

that there are pairs of lines passing through the origin to which we cannot assign an angle.

However, for the triangles we will be working with, the ratio of segments behaves as if it

were an angle, of negative value. The true angle is obtained by symmetry with respect to

the ﬁrst bisecting line, as the pair α and −α indicates in Figure 1.

III. RELATIVISTIC ADDITION OF VELOCITIES

Consider a reference frame K’ which is moving with a velocity V = V ˆx relative to another

one K, and a particle moving with a velocity v′ = v ′

zˆz′ in the reference frame

xˆx′ + v ′

y ˆy′ + v ′

K’. The reference frames are chosen such that their origins and the particle coincide at the

space-time point O, as shown in Figure 1. Notice that ˆy = ˆy′ and ˆz = ˆz′, because V has a

component only in the x direction. The Oz axis is not plotted, but is similar to the Oy axis.

The question is: What is the velocity v = vx ˆx + vy ˆy + vzˆz of the particle in the reference

frame K?

The world-line OP of the particle is projected on the complex planes (x,O,ict), (y,O,ict),

(z,O,ict), (x’,O,ict’), (y’,O,ict’), (z’,O,ict’), and the resulting angles from the respective

projections give the components of the velocity of the particle in the two reference frames

considered. For the situation considered the planes (x,O,ict) and (x’,O,ict’) coincide. It is

seen from Figure 1 that

In order to express vx and vy as functions of V, v ′

x and v ′

y we need to express δ and θ as

functions of α,β and γ.

In the plane (x,O,ict) of the Lorentz boost the addition of velocities is based on the

addition of angles [3]

θ = α + β

tan(θ) = tan(α + β) =

tan(α) + tan(β)
1 − tan(α) tan(β)

.

From (11), by substitution of the tangents (5)-(9), it follows that

vx =

V + v ′

1 + V v ′

IV. ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERACTION BETWEEN TWO UNIFORMLY

MOVING CHARGED PARTICLES

Consider two charged particles (with charges Q1 and Q2) at some arbitrary positions,

moving with arbitrary, but uniform, velocities. We orient our 3D reference frame in such a

way that the ﬁrst particle (which generates the ﬁeld) is initially at the origin, moving along

the Ox axis with velocity V = V ˆx, and the vector R = R cos(θ)ˆx + R sin(θ)ˆy connecting

the two particles is in the (x,O,y) plane. The angle between R and the Ox axis is θ. The

second particle (subject to the electromagnetic ﬁeld generated by the ﬁrst one) is moving

with velocity v = vxˆx + vy ˆy + vzˆz. A section through the (x,O,y) plane can be seen in

Figure 2. The ﬁrst particle is at point O and the second one is at point A.

A. Analytical calculation of the Lorentz force

The electric ﬁeld (in Gaussian units) generated by the ﬁrst particle at the position of the

second particle is [4,5]

E =

Q1R
R3 (1 −

V 2
c2 )[1 −

V 2
c2 sin2(θ)]−3/2.

The magnetic ﬁeld generated by the ﬁrst particle is

H =

1
c

V × E.

The Lorentz force acting on the second particle is

F = Q2E +

Q2
c

v × H.

From (17)-(19) the Cartesian components of the force [6] are obtained

Fx =

Q1Q2
R2 (1 −

Fz = 0.

B. Geometrical derivation of the Lorentz force

The force components (20)-(22) can be obtained in a more graphical way, if we start

with the Coulomb force generated by a charged particle at rest. One key assumption or

experimental fact is that in a frame where all the source charges producing an electric ﬁeld

E are at rest, the force on a charge q is given by F = qE independent of the velocity of the

charge in that frame [7]. The reference frame K’ in which the source particle is at rest is

moving with velocity V relative to the original frame K.

In the reference frame K the particle at A is observed to interact with the particle at O.

The distance between particles is R, the length of the segment OA.

In the reference frame K’ the particle at A is observed to interact with the particle at B,

where the segment BA is a position vector R′ parallel to the plane (x’,O,y’). The following

construction gives the position of point B: the segment AE is parallel to Oy and intersects

the Ox axis at E, whereas the segment EB is parallel to Ox’ and intersects the world-line

CO at B. BD projects the point B on the Ox axis at D.

Relative to K’, the particle at B exerts a radial Coulomb force on the particle at A. This

force (in Gaussian units) is

F′ =

Q1Q2
R′3

R′

(23)

where R′ = R′[cos(θ′)ˆx′ + sin(θ′)ˆy′].

The key point in getting the force F in the reference frame K is to notice that the force,

in any reference frame considered, is given by the projection on the real 3D space of that

frame of the 4-force F (which is a Minkowski-space vector), that is

F = F real + F imag = γ(v)F + ˆiγ(v)

P
c

F = F ′

real + F ′

imag = γ(v ′)F′ + ˆi

′

γ(v ′)

P ′
c

(24)

(25)

where γ(v) = (1 − v2/c2)−1/2 and P = F · v.

6

We will obtain the 4-force F from its real and imaginary components (F ′

real and F ′

imag) in

the reference frame K’, then we will decompose the same 4-force into its real and imaginary

components (F real and F imag) in the reference frame K. The Lorentz force we are looking

for is just F = F real/γ(v).

From (23)-(25) it follows that

F ′

real = γ(v ′)

Q1Q2
R′3

R′.

(26)

To get the imaginary component F ′

imag we use the orthogonality between the 4-force and

the 4-velocity, F · V = 0, where the 4-velocity is V = γ(v ′)v′ + ˆi

′

γ(v ′)c. The orthogonality

condition leads to

γ2(v ′)

imag = ˆi

γ(v ′)

Q1Q2
R′2

v ′

where the radial component of the velocity is

v ′
rad =

R′ · v′
R′ = v ′

x cos(θ′) + v ′

y sin(θ′).

(27)

(28)

(29)

The components of the force F in the reference frame K are given by the projection of

the 4-force F on the 3D real space of K. An easy way to do this is to notice that we can

decompose F ′

real (which has the direction of the segment BA) and F ′

imag (which has the

direction of the segment BO) into sums of 4-vectors, each of the 4-vectors being parallel to

one of the axes of the reference frame K:

rBA = rBD + rDE + rEA

rBO = rBD + rDO

(30)

(31)

Because these expansions do not involve any component along the Oz axis, this simply

means that Fz = 0. The projections of the 4-force on the Ox and Oy axes are

The lengths of the various segments needed above are as follows:

AO = R

EA = AO sin(θ) = R sin(θ)

OE = AO cos(θ) = R cos(θ)

BE = OE cos(α) = R cos(θ) cos(α)

DE = BE cos(α) = R cos(θ) cos2(α)

AB = (AE2 + BE2)1/2 = R cos(α)[1 + tan2(α) sin2(θ)]1/2 = R′

We also notice that DO/BO = sin(−α). The force components in (32)-(33) become

Fx =

γ(v)

cos3(α)[1 + tan2(α) sin2(θ)]3/2 .

We can also calculate

sin(θ′) =

EA
AB

=

sin(θ)

cos(α)[1 + tan2(α) sin2(θ)]1/2

If the velocity of the particle at A has the components vx, vy, vz, as measured in the reference

frame K, and K is moving with the velocity V′ = −V ˆx′ relative to K’, then the particle

will have the following components of the velocity (compare with equations (12) and (16))

in the reference frame K’

v ′
x =

vx − V

1 − V vx/c2

v ′
y =

vy(1 − V 2/c2)1/2

1 − V vx/c2

v ′
z =

vz(1 − V 2/c2)1/2

1 − V vx/c2

.

(44)

With these components we ﬁnd that

γ(v ′) = γ(v)

(1 − V vx/c2)
(1 − V 2/c2)1/2

and the radial velocity (29) becomes

v ′
rad =

(vx − V ) cos(α) cos(θ) + vy(1 − V 2/c2)1/2 sin(θ)

(1 − V vx/c2) cos(α)[1 + tan2(α) sin2(θ)]1/2

.

(45)

(46)

Substituting γ(v ′) and v ′

rad in (40)-(41), and also using the fact that sin(α) = i(V /c)γ(V ),

cos(α) = γ(V ) and tan(α) = iV /c, we ﬁnally obtain the components in (20)-(21).

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a geometrical calculation of the relativistic addition of velocities, and

of the electromagnetic interaction between two uniformly moving charged particles. The

geometrical approach used is an elegant, more intuitive and alternative way of obtaining

these important results of Special Relativity. We hope our work will usefully complement

other pedagogical eﬀorts [8–10] centered on Minkowski space diagrams.

Abstract

Using the canonical formalism, Compagno and Persico [J. Phys. A: Math.
Gen. 35 (2002) 3629–45] have calculated the ‘radiation-reaction’ force on
a uniform spherical charge moving rigidly, slowly and slightly from a point
where the transverse electric ﬁeld is assumed to vanish. This force is shown
to result in the same time-averaged self-force as that which has been obtained
by diﬀerent means for the test charge of a Bohr–Rosenfeld ﬁeld-measurement
procedure and which Compagno and Persico claimed to be incorrect.

In a recent paper [1], Compagno and Persico (CP) have calculated, by solving the cou-
pled charge–ﬁeld Hamilton equations of motion, the ‘radiation-reaction’ force on a spheri-
cally symmetric charge that moves rigidly, slowly and only a little from a point where the
transverse electric ﬁeld is assumed to vanish. For a charge q that is uniformly distributed
within a sphere of radius a, they obtain a ‘radiation-reaction’ force

where ˙Q(t) is the time derivative of a one-dimensional trajectory of the charge and Θ(x) is
the Heaviside step function; here and henceforth, we use units such that the speed of light
c = 1 and put t = 0 for the time at which the transverse electric ﬁeld vanishes.

CP remark that the result (1) is relevant to the issues raised in recent papers [2–5] in con-
nection with the Bohr–Rosenfeld (BR) analysis of the measurability of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld [6], as it should apply to a BR measurement procedure with only minor modiﬁcations.
In the present note, we show that the force (1), which we prefer to call the electromagnetic
self-force, results in the same time-averaged self-force as that which has been obtained by
diﬀerent means in [3,5] for the test charge of a BR measurement procedure and which CP
have rejected in [4] as incorrectly calculated.

A condition on the one-dimensional trajectory Q(t) of the test charge in a BR measure-
ment procedure occupying a time interval (0, T ) is that Q(t) = 0 for t ≤ 0. While this means
that the transverse electric ﬁeld of the test charge vanishes at t = 0, the initial condition
˙Q(t)|t=0 = 0 that is implied would result according to (1) in Q(t) = 0 also for t > 0 if there
were no other force acting on the test charge in addition to the self-force. It is presumably
for this reason that when CP touch on the applicability of (1) to the test charge of the BR
measurement procedure, they invoke the ‘neutralization’ of the test charge at t = 0 by the
stationary neutralizing charge employed in the procedure. Beside the question whether such
a neutralization alone indeed guarantees a vanishing transverse electric ﬁeld at t = 0, the
fact remains that then there is at least one other force acting on the test charge, namely the
electrostatic force of attraction to the neutralizing charge. It thus appears inescapable that
any meaningful use of formula (1) in an analysis of the BR ﬁeld-measurement procedure
requires the presence of external forces. We shall ﬁrst write (1) in a diﬀerent form before
returning to this point.

Using integration by parts, we write (1) as

where the factor Θ(t − t′) is introduced in the integrand in order to be able to ﬁx the
integration range as (0, T ). Apart from diﬀerences in notation, this expression is the same
as that for the self-force Fx(t2) given in [5] by equations (26) and (28), with a factor of 2
instead of 3 in the delta-function term of equation (28) so that the electrostatic force due
to a BR neutralizing charge is subtracted.

The self-force Fx(t2) was obtained in [5] by using the electromagnetic self-ﬁeld of a uni-
form spherical charge whose trajectory was prescribed to be a given trajectory Q(t) satisfying
the conditions imposed on it by the BR ﬁeld-measurement procedure apart from the stipu-
lation that it is to have a step-like character with respect to the measurement period (0, T ).
This fact invalidates the caution of CP that the force which they obtained ‘is unambiguously
the radiation-reaction force only in the absence of other forces’. A prescribed trajectory can
result to a given degree of accuracy only when there is a suitable external force acting on
the charge in addition to the self-force. In the BR ﬁeld-measurement procedure, the test
charge is acted on by an external force that is the resultant of forces originating from sev-
eral sources: the momentum-measurement system, the neutralizing charge, the spring that
compensates the time-averaged eﬀects of the self-force and the neutralizing charge, and,
of course, the measured external ﬁeld itself; the approximate attainment of the prescribed
step-like trajectory is there facilitated by the fact that the test charge is allowed to have an
arbitrarily great mass.

The test charge’s self-force averaged over the duration T of the ﬁeld measurement,

¯FRR =

can now be written using (5) as

Expressions (10) and (11) are, apart from diﬀerences in notation and the absence in (10) of
the electrostatic term −1/a3 due to the neutralizing charge, the same as those given for the
time-averaged self-force in equations (3) and (9) of [3] and equations (10) and (22) of [5];
these expressions have been claimed by CP to be incorrect [4].

It has been shown in [5] that the rejection [4] of CP of the criticism [3] of their re-analysis
[2] of the BR ﬁeld-measurement procedure is based on erroneous calculations. It has to be
concluded that that rejection is invalidated also by the results of the latest work of CP
themselves.

Abstract

In this paper we propose a novel algebraic and geometric description
for the dissipative dynamics. Our formulation bears some similarity with
the Poisson structure for non-dissipative systems. We develop a canonical
description for constrained dissipative systems through an extension of the
Dirac brackets concept, and we present a new formula for calculating Dirac
brackets. This formula is particularly useful in description of dynamical
systems with many second-class constraints. After presenting necessary for-
mal background we illustrate our method on several examples taken from
particle dynamics, continuum media physics and wave mechanics.

Introduction

The ﬁrst systematic attempt to provide mathematically consistent quanti-
zation procedure for constrained systems was given by P.M. Dirac [1], who
derived a formal “replacement” for the canonical Poisson brackets which
plays today a fundamental role in the canonical formalism for constrained
Hamiltonian systems on both classical and quantum levels. In spite of the
considerable attention paid to that formula in the mathematical literature
[2, 3, 4], and several attempts to use the Dirac brackets in the quantization
of gauge invariant systems, eg. [5, 6] etc., until recently there were few at-
tempts to actually use this formalizm in more conventional applications. We
have recently provided few examples of these applications in classical and
continuum mechanics [7].

The canonical formalizm applies to the conservative systems. These sys-
tems form a relatively small sub-class of interesting physical systems since
most of the others describing phenomena at some eﬀective rather than fun-
damental level are dissipative. In the past several attempts were done to
describe dissipative classical mechanics in a fashion similar to its canonical
description. One of these attempts, so called metriplectic approach [8, 9]
was advocated as a natural extension of the mixed canonical-dissipative dy-
namic proposed by Enz [10]. In this paper we extend further the concept of
metriplectic dynamics to what we shall call semimetric-Poissonian dynam-
ics, which is nothing but a natural combination of semimetric dynamics (a
dissipative part) and Poissonian dynamics (a conservative part). We pro-
pose a canonical description for constrained dissipative systems through an
extension of the concept of Dirac brackets [1] developed originally for conser-
vative constrained Hamiltonian dynamics, to the non-Hamiltonian, namely
metric and mixed metriplectic, constrained dynamics. It turns out that this
generalized uniﬁed formula for the Dirac brackets is very useful in the de-
scription and analysis of a wider class of dynamical systems. To proceed
with our approach we develop a new formula for calculating Dirac brackets
which is particularly eﬀective in ﬁnding equations of motion and constants
of motions for systems with many constraints.

In order to make this paper self-contained we include in Section II a
short “primer ” to the Poisson geometry, dynamics and the Dirac brackets.
The rest of the paper is organized into four sections. In Section III we
discuss semimetric dynamics and some elementary features of the related
mathematical structures like semimetric algebras and SJ-identity the late
should be regarded as dynamical symmetric version of the Jacobi identity.

1

We develop symmetric concepts in the analogy with those in the Poisson
category in Appendix.

In Section IV we discuss semimetric dynamics subject to some con-
straints. We derive a symmetric analogue of the Dirac brackets and pro-
vide its geometric interpretation as induced metric on some submanifold of
a Riemannian manifold. We also present a new eﬀective algorithm for cal-
culation of the Dirac brackets in both symmetric and antisymmetric cases.
Few examples, for ﬁnite and inﬁnite dimensional cases, are also discussed in
some detail.

In the section V we discuss semimetric-Poissonian dynamics which is a
combination of semimetric dynamics, discussed in the section III, and Pois-
sonian dynamics mentioned in the section II. This section also includes the
extended Dirac approach to constrained semimetric-Poissonian which is a
combination of the Dirac approach to constrained semimetric dynamics dis-
cussed in the section IV and the usual to constrained Poissonian dynamics.
In Section VI we discuss interesting physical examples: the dissipative
formulation of the Schr¨odinger equation due to Gisin [11], the Landau-
Lifshitz-Gilbert equations for damped spins [8, 12], dynamics of damped
rigid body – including among other the Morrison equation of damped rigid
body [9]. We also discuss a novel description of the incompressible viscous
ﬂuid.

Some important but not crucial mathematical aspects of the extended
canonical formalism for constrained metric and mixed semimetric-Poissonian
systems will be given in the forthcoming publication [13]. Computational
aspects of the Dirac brackets – symmetric, antisymmetric or mixed – will
be publish shortly [14].

2 Poisson geometry, dynamics and Dirac brackets

From the algebraic point of view the Poisson algebra is a linear space F
equipped with two structures:

i) the commutative algebra structure with the (associate) multiplication
F × F → F, the product of two elements f, g is denoted simply by f g,

ii) the Lie algebra structure with the Lie bracket {·, ·} : F × F → F, the

product of two elements f, g is denoted by {f, g},

related to each other by the Leibniz rule:

{f g, h} = f {g, h} + {f, h}g .

(2.1)

The Lie bracket of a Poisson algebra is called the Poisson bracket.

The Poisson manifold is a smooth manifold M for which the commuta-
tive algebra of smooth functions on M , C∞(M ), is equipped with the Pois-
son bracket. The Poisson bracket {·, ·} acts on each function as a derivation,
thus there exists a contravariant (2, 0)-tensor Π such that {f, g} = Π(df, dg)
for every functions f, g. In the local coordinates (zk)

{f, g}(z) =

Πij(z) ∂if ∂jg , ∂k ≡

(2.2)

∂
∂zk .

m

Xi,j

The tensor Π which deﬁnes a Poisson bracket is called a Poisson tensor.
The antisymmetry of Poisson bracket implies that tensor Π must be anti-
symmetric, so Πij = −Πji. The Jacobi identity requires that

Πli ∂lΠjk + Πlj ∂lΠki + Πlk ∂lΠij = 0 .

(2.3)

N

Xl=1

A Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld generated by a function h is a vector ﬁeld deﬁned
by Xh(f ) = {f, h} for ∀f . All ﬂows generated by Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds–
Hamiltonian ﬂows, preserve the Poisson structure.

Poisson dynamics or generalized Hamiltonian dynamics is a dynamics
generated by some Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld, for which the Hamiltonian func-
tion plays physically speciﬁc role.

z : T ∗

Let T M and T ∗M denotes the tangent, and cotangent bundle of the
manifold M . The Poisson tensor Π induces a bundle map Π♯ : T ∗M → T M
which is deﬁned by Π♯(df ) := Xf for all functions f . The rank of a Poisson
structure at point z is deﬁned to be the rank of Π♯
z M → TzM , which is
equal to the rank of matrix Πij(z) in the local coordinates (zk). A Poisson
structure with constant rank equal to the dimension of the manifold M is
called symplectic or nondegenerate.
In this case the “inverse map” of Π,
denoted by ω, is a symplectic 2-form and ω(Xf , Xg) = {f, g} = Π(df, dg).
The Darboux theorem states that for every symplectic structure there ex-
ists, locally, a canonical coordinates system (x1, . . . , xk, p1, . . . , pk) such that
∂x ∧ ∂
Π = ∂
∂p , (ω = dx ∧ dp), or equivalently, {xi, xj} = {pi, pj} = 0,
{xi, pj} = δij.
The invariance of the Poisson structure under Hamiltonian ﬂows implies the
constancy the tensor Π rank along the orbits of such ﬂows. The orbit of
each point of M under the action of all Hamiltonian ﬂows forms a symplec-
tic manifold called a symplectic leave. Since M is a union of such orbits

3

every Poisson manifold is a smooth union of disjoint connected symplectic
manifold (symplectic leaves) of various ranks.
The splitting theorem [15] for Poisson manifolds, states that locally every
Poisson manifold is the product of a symplectic manifold and a Poisson man-
ifold with zero rank. In the other words, locally in the neighborhood of the
point z0 there always exist canonical coordinates system:
(x1, . . . , xk, p1, . . . , pk, z2k+1, . . . , zn) such that {xi, xj} = {pi, pj} = 0, {xi, pj} =
δij, {xi, zl} = {pj, zl} = 0, {zr, zs} = Ars and Ars(z0) = 0.
The map ϕ : M1 → M2 between two Poisson manifolds is called Poisson
mapping iﬀ {f ◦ ϕ, g ◦ ϕ}1 = {f, g}2 ◦ ϕ. The Poisson mapping is a natu-
ral generalization of the well-known from classical mechanics notion of the
canonical transformation.
In the usual formulation of the classical mechanics the constrained dynamics
can be visualized geometrically as the dynamics on some submanifold of the
system phase space. Similarly, the constrained Poisson dynamics can be rep-
resented as such on some submanifold of the Poisson manifold. However, it
is not always possible to deﬁne induced Poisson structure on a submanifold
and therefore we have no obvious way how to generalize constrained Pois-
son dynamics. If the Poisson structure is non-degenerate (symplectic case)
then on each submanifold there exists an induced two form which becomes
symplectic if it is non-degenerate. Further for an arbitrary submanifold N
of a symplectic manifold (M, ω) there always exists a maximal submanifold
N ′ ⊂ N such ω|N ′ is non-degenerate, then N ′ has an induced symplectic
hence Poisson structure.
Dirac [1] has proposed an algebraic procedure to deal with constrained dy-
namics. First consider any ﬁnite set of (linearly independent) constraints
A = {a1, . . . , ak} ⊂ F ≡ C∞(M ) and deﬁne weakly-vanishing (or weakly-
zero) elements as linear combinations of constraints with arbitrary functions
coeﬃcients, i.e. I = {
Element f ∈ F is called ﬁrst-class with respect to the set of constraints A
iﬀ it has weekly-zero bracket with all constraints, i.e. ∀a ∈ A : {f, a} ∈ I.
Otherwise, it is called second-class. The set of all ﬁrst-class elements de-
noted by F1(A), forms a linear subspace of F and the set of all second-class
elements, denoted by F2(A).
This classiﬁcation divides the set of constraints A into two subsets: ﬁrst-class
constraints A1 = A ∩ F1(A) and second-class constraints A2 = A ∩ F2(A).
The number of second-class constraints must be even A2 = {Θ1, . . . , Θ2s}.
Dirac has proven the Gramm matrix of second-class constraints, [{Θi, Θj}] =
W , is weakly non-degenerate. This allowed him to deﬁne new antisymmetric

where C = [Cij] = W −1 is an inverse matrix of W . Using (2.4) one can
check that the Dirac brackets posses all the required properties of the Poisson
brackets. The (algebraic) proof of the Jacobi identity is diﬃcult. One can
easily check that all the second-class constraints are Casimirs with respect
to the Dirac bracket, i.e. {Θk, f }D = 0 for all f .

3 Semimetric manifolds and semimetric dynami-

cal systems

In this section we introduce a concept of semimetric algebras and semimetric
manifolds which play a similar role in the description of dissipative systems
as the Poisson algebras and the Poisson manifolds in the description of con-
servative dynamics. In the last two sections of this work we will show that
the semimetric structure together with the Poisson structure are suﬃcient
for “canonical” description of a wide class of dissipative dynamical systems.

Let X be non-empty set. A semimetric bracket on the linear space of
real functions deﬁned on X, namely F = F un(X), is a bilinear operation
≺ ·, · ≻: F × F → F which satisﬁes the following requirements:

i) It is symmetric: ∀f, g ∈ F : ≺ f, g ≻=≺ g, f ≻.

ii) It satisﬁes the Leibniz rule: ∀f, g, h ∈ F : ≺ f g, h ≻=≺ f, h ≻

g + f ≺ g, h ≻.

iii) It is non-negative deﬁnite: ∀f ∈ F : ≺ f, f ≻≥ 0, i.e. the function
≺ f, f ≻ is non-negative deﬁnite function, ∀x ∈ X :≺ f, f ≻ (x) ≥ 0.

Note that if a bilinear operation on F satisﬁes conditions i), ii) it is called
pseudo-metric bracket or symmetric Leibniz bracket. A symmetric Leibniz
bracket which satisﬁes the condition

iii*) Positive deﬁnite: ∀f ∈ F : ≺ f, f ≻≥ 0 and ≺ f, f ≻= 0 iﬀ

f = Const (at least locally),

5

is called metric bracket.

Symmetric Leibniz algebra is a linear space F equipped with two struc-
tures: commutative algebra structure with the (associate, commutative)
multiplication and symmetric (non-associate, non-commutative) structure
and these two structures are related by the Leibniz rule. Semimetric algebra
is a symmetric Leibniz algebra whose bracket is semimetric.
As we shall see the semimetric algebra can be used to describe the (wide
class) of the dissipative classical systems akin to the description of the non-
dissipative dynamics by means of the Poisson algebra.
From now we assume that X is a smooth ﬁnite dimensional manifold, namely
Phase space, and F = C∞(X) is a space of all smooth functions on X.
There is a correspondence1 one to one between the symmetric Leibniz brack-
ets on the space of functions and the symmetric tensors on the manifold X:
≺ f, g ≻= G(df, dg) where G is a contravariant tensor ﬁeld of the type (2, 0)
on X. In the local coordinates (zk), each symmetric tensor is of the form
, where Gij = Gji, hence each symmetric Leibniz
G(z) =

A symmetric bracket becomes semimetric bracket iﬀ it is non-negative, i.e.
the matrix [Gij] is non-negative deﬁnite.
A semimetric bracket is called a metric bracket if G is positive deﬁnite (non-
negative and non-degenerate), i.e. with constant maximal rank, rank G =
dim X. In the general the tensor G may have a nonconstant rank which
depends on points.

Deﬁnition 3.1 Semimetric manifold is a smooth manifold M for which
the commutative algebra of smooth functions on M is a semimetric algebra,
i.e.
it is equipped with a semimetric bracket. Geometrically, semimetric
manifold can be viewed as a pair (M, G) where G is semimetric tensor (or
cometric tensor), i.e. symmetric, non-negative deﬁnite: G(df, df ) ≥ 0 for
every function f , contravariant (2, 0)-tensor ﬁeld.

As we shall see this is exactly a semimetric bracket need in viscous
ﬂuid dynamics. ✷

We shall call semimetric dynamics a dynamics which is governed by some
semimetric (dissipative) vector ﬁeld.
In local coordinate system (zk), we
have the following system of ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations:

where ≺ ·, · ≻ is semimetric bracket, X D
S is a dissipative vector ﬁeld gener-
ated by function S deﬁned on the phase space, and G is a semimetric tensor.
In some very special cases the function S has a physical interpretation as
entropy. S is always non-decreasing, since

˙S =≺ S, S ≻≥ 0 .

(3.10)

If f, g are Constants for semimetric dynamics, then the Leibniz rule ensures
that f g is also a constant, but ≺ f, g ≻ is usually not a constant due to
the lack of the Jacobi identity. We shall now introduce a new concept a
symmetric analogy of the Jacobi Identity which we call the SJ-identity.

iv) SJ-identity:

∀ f, g, h ∈ F : 2 ≺≺ f, g ≻, h ≻ = [≺≺ f, h ≻, g ≻ + ≺≺ g, h ≻, f ≻]

⇐⇒ ∀ f, h ∈ F : ≺≺ f, f ≻, h ≻ = ≺≺ f, h ≻, f ≻ .

(3.11)

A symmetric dynamical system is called a SP-dynamics (“symmetric Poisson
dynamics”) iﬀ the symmetric Jacobi identity (3.11) holds.

Proposition 3.2 If f, g are Constants of the SP-dynamics, then ≺ f, g ≻
also is a Constant of motion. In particular, if f is a constant, then ≺ f, f ≻
also.

Proof.

Indeed, since ≺ f, S ≻=≺ g, S ≻= 0 we have

Q.E.D.

Therefore constants of SP-dynamics form a subalgebra. This property is
quite useful in ﬁnding constants of motion for SP-dynamics.
Note that each autonomous dynamical system described by the system of
the ﬁrst order diﬀerential equations

Furthermore, locally and almost everywhere each dynamical system (3.13) is
metric. Indeed, for each point from the set {x : ∀k = 1, . . . , n : Fk(x) 6= 0}
there exists a neighborhood U such that functions Fk do not change their
sign inside U . Let denote sk = signFk = ±1 in U . In the neighborhood
U , the system should be regarded as metric system with, for instance,
Gij(x) = siδij Fi(x) ≥ 0 and S =
k skxk. In particular, locally and al-
most everywhere, Poisson dynamics also admit a metric description. Each
P
dynamical system of the type ˙xk = Fk(x) should be regarded as Poisso-
nian system after doubling the number of variables.
Indeed, consider a
canonical Poisson structure: {xi, xj} = 0 = {pi, pj}, {xi, pj} = δij and let
H(x, p) =

A system is non-Poissonian (or non-metric) if it can not be written in the
Poisson (resp. metric) form without changing the number of variables. Each
dynamical system of the type ˙xk = Fk(x) where functions Fk(x) are positive-
deﬁnite, is a metric system but it is (in the general) non-Poissonian. The
answer to the question which Poissonian system admits a global metric de-
scription, remains unknown.
Morrison [9] has pointed out that metric dynamical systems admit an asymp-
totic stability at isolated maxima of function S. To show that let x be an iso-

4 Constrained metric dynamics

In the frame work of symplectic geometry, constrained Hamiltonian dynam-
ics can be represented by a triplet (M, N, ω) where (M, ω) is a symplectic
manifold, namely Phase space, and N is a constraint submanifold of M .
Antisymmetric Dirac bracket for second-class constraints [1, 16] is nothing
but the Poisson bracket on some symplectic manifold N ′ ⊂ N , called the
second-class constraint manifold [16] et. al. (also in [2]).
Similarly, constrained metric dynamics should be represented by a triplet
(M, N, g) where g is metric tensor which is responsible for a dissipation
and N is a constraint submanifold of M . We show that symmetric Dirac
bracket for a triple (M, N, g) is nothing but the semimetric bracket on the
submanifold N . It is worthy to note that any submanifold of a Riemannian
manifold is second-class with respect to the metric bracket deﬁned by the
metric tensor.
Suppose that we have a pair (M, ξ) where M is a smooth manifold and ξ is
non-degenerate symmetric (0, 2)-tensor on M . Then at each point x ∈ M the
map ξx : TxM × TxM → R is bilinear, symmetric and non-degenerate and it
induces a linear bijection ξ♯
x M → TxM . Further, if ξ is Riemann metric

x : T ∗

11

tensor, then ξx is a scalar product on TxM . The non-degeneracy of the ten-
sor ξ guarantees an existence of a (2, 0)-tensor ﬁeld Λ : T ∗M × T ∗M → R.
Let N be a submanifold of M and ξ|N is supposed to be non-degenerate.
Then at each point x of the submanifold N , the linear space TxM decom-
poses into direct sum of a tangent space to N , TxN , and its orthogonal with
respect to bilinear symmetric functional ξx, i.e. TxM = TxN ⊕(TxN )⊥. The
symmetric Dirac bracket with respect to a triple (M, N, ξ) is deﬁned by

ΛD(α, β) = ξ(P ξ♯(α), P ξ♯(β)) , where P is a projection

onto TxN along (TxN )⊥, α, β are 1-forms on M . (4.1)

The symmetric Dirac bracket in the space of functions is then

≺ f, g ≻D = ΛD(df, dg) , ∀f, g ∈ C∞(M ).

(4.2)

If N is the second-class submanifold

N = {x ∈ M : Θi(x) = 0} ,

(4.3)

then we derive explicite formula for symmetric Dirac bracket with respect
to the triple (M, N, ξ). Let us denote Xg a vector ﬁeld generated by the
function g, i.e. Xg(f ) = Λ(df, dg) =≺ f, g ≻= ξ(Xf , Xg). Let W = [Wij] =
[≺ Θi, Θj ≻] = [ξ(XΘi, XΘj )] and C = [Cij] = W −1. It is easy to see that
the vector ﬁelds XΘi span T N ⊥, then orthogonal projection Q onto T N ⊥
along T N has a form:

QX =

ξ(X, XΘi )CijXΘj .

(4.4)

Xi,j

Then the orthogonal projection P onto T N along T N ⊥ is of the form P X =
i,j ξ(X, XΘi )CijXΘj . Then the
X − QX, hence we have P Xf = Xf −
symmetric Dirac formula is of the form

P

≺ f, g ≻D = ΛD(df, dg) = ξ(P Xf , P Xg) = ξ(Xf , P Xg)

= ξ(Xf , Xg) − ξ(Xf , QXg)

≺ f, Θi ≻ Cij ≺ Θj, g ≻ ,

(4.5)

which coincides with the antisymmetric Dirac bracket formula (2.4) for Pois-
son bracket with the antisymmetric brackets {·, ·} replaced by ≺ ·, · ≻. Our

procedure shown above applies to both cases, for symmetric or antisymmet-
ric (0, 2)-tensors.
The Dirac formula (4.5) plays a key role in the practical use of the Dirac
brackets. Algebraically, one may use it as a deﬁnition of the Dirac bracket for
an arbitrary symmetric or antisymmetric algebra. The disadvantage of the
algebraic approach is based on the fact that it is very diﬃcult to understand
why the Jacobi identity for the new Dirac bracket holds when the above
procedure is applied to a Poisson bracket. In the metric context, if the alge-
braic formula (4.5) is regarded as a deﬁnition of the Dirac bracket, then it is
easy to check that new algebraic Dirac bracket is symmetric Leibniz bracket
the algebraic properties i), ii) hold), but the crucial non-negativity
(i.e.
property iii) is not easy to verify. A simple proof will be given latter after
the Theorem 4.1.

It is easy to see that

≺ Θa, f ≻D= 0 , for arbitrary function f (z) ,

(4.6)

therefore all constraints Θa are Casimirs, i.e. belong to the Centrum of the
semimetric algebra (C∞(X), ≺ ·, · ≻D).
Now we would like to present the new formula for calculating symmetric or
antisymmetric Dirac bracket.

The same formula holds for antisymmetric Dirac brackets.

The proof is straightforward; one applies twice the Laplace recursive formula
for the determinant expansion to the last column and row of the matrix Wf,g.
✷

One consequence of (4.7) and (4.8) for semimetric bracket is that ∀f we
have ≺ f, f ≻D= det Wf,f
det W , and therefore the inequality ≺ f, f ≻D≥ 0 holds,
according to the Proposition 3.1. In one constraint case, this is equivalent
to the Schwartz inequality.
The theorem 4.1 provides a new eﬀective formula for calculating Dirac
brackets for both symmetric and antisymmetric case. Usually, the direct
attempt to use the formula (4.5) is impractical for a system with rather big
number of constraints of second type. This is because it requires quite com-
plicated evaluation of the elements of the inverse matrix Cij. Note, however,
that when we are not interested in the Dirac brackets but only in result-
ing equations for constrained dynamics then the evaluation of C = W −1
is unnecessary. Applying theorem 4.1 we ﬁnd immediately equation of the
quantity f in constrained symmetric/antisymmetric dynamics:

˙f =≺ f, H ≻D=

, or

˙f = {f, H}D =

det Wf,H

(4.9)

This formula is particularly convenient for ﬁnding constants of motion for

Below we show few examples of the constrained symmetric Dirac brackets
which are applicable in diﬀerential geometry and physics.

Example 4.1 Consider the standard Euclidean metrics ≺ zi, zj ≻= δij =
Gij and the ﬁxed surface f (z) = 0 in Rn. Here the function f is assumed
to be smooth and with zero as it regular value, that is f −1(0) is a close
regular n − 1 dimensional diﬀerential submanifold in Rn. Using f (z) = 0 as
a constraint we ﬁnd the Dirac semimetric brackets

5 Semimetric-Poissonian systems

The physical systems are usually dissipative. It turns out that both Pois-
sonian and metric structures alone are not enough to describe dissipative
systems. However, a proper combination of these two types of dynamics
can, for many interesting cases, provide a satisfactory and fully algebraic
description of dissipative dynamics.

A semimetric-Poissonian bracket on the space of functions F = C∞(X)
is a bilinear operation {{·, ·}} : F × F → F which is a linear combination of
a Poisson and a semimetric bracket

∀f, g ∈ F : {{f, g}} = {f, g}− ≺ f, g ≻ ,

(5.1)

where {·, ·} is the Poisson bracket and ≺ ·, · ≻ is the semimetric bracket.

Deﬁnition 5.1 Semimetric-Poisson manifold is a pair (M, Π − G) where Π
is a Poisson tensor, G is a semimetric tensor.

We shall call a Semimetric-Poissonian dynamics a dynamics governed by
the following system of equations:

˙zi = {{zi, Φ}} = {zi, Φ}− ≺ zi, Φ ≻= XΦ(zi) − X D

Φ (zi) ,

(5.2)

In real physical applications it is
where Φ is some phase space function.
often the case that Φ has the interpretation of the system free energy. It is
then a matter of convention to chose minus sign in the eq.(5.2). Indeed we
have then

˙Φ = {Φ, Φ}− ≺ Φ, Φ ≻= − ≺ Φ, Φ ≻≤ 0 .

(5.3)

what describes the dissipation of energy.
It is often even more convenient to go a step further and decompose function
Φ into two parts: the internal energy H and the dissipation function S, so
Φ = H − S. Hence, when S is a Casimir of the Poissonian part, {f, S} = 0
for all f , the evolution of some “observable” f in the semimetric-Poissonian
dynamics follows

˙f = {{f, Φ}} = {f, H}− ≺ f, H − S ≻ .

(5.4)

19

Equation (5.4) for f = S give us the semimetric-Poissonian formulation for
the “second law of thermodynamics”, namely

˙S+ ≺ S, H ≻ = ≺ S, S ≻≥ 0 ,

(5.5)

where the expression on the l.h.s. of Eq.(5.5) is just the convective time
derivative of S along the time trajectory in the semimetric-Poissonian phase
space.

Note that if x is an isolated minimum of Φ, then the function L(z) =
Φ(z) − Φ(x) is a Liapunov function for semimetric-Poisson system. Hence,
we obtain

Proposition 5.1 If x is an isolated minimum of the free energy function
Φ, then x is a stable equilibrium point for semimetric-Poissonian system
˙z = {z, Φ}− ≺ z, Φ ≻. Furthermore, if the system is metric-Poissonian,
then x is asymptotically stable point.

Example 5.1 Consider a modiﬁcation of the harmonic oscillator described
by

˙x1 = x2 − ax1(x2

1 + x2

2),

˙x2 = −x1 − ax2(x2

1 + x2

2) .

(5.6)

Point (0, 0) is an isolated minimum of Φ, hence it is a stable equilibrium
point for the system.

✷

The proposed in preceding sections formal structure of Poissonian and semi-
metric dynamics allows us to suggest the following scheme for construction
of constrained dissipative dynamics of real physical systems.

a) Consider a canonical Poisson structure and semimetric structure. The
semimetric structure must be postulated according to our physical
insight in the nature of relevant dissipative processes.

b) Choose sets A, B of second-class constraints for the Poissonian and
semimetric part, respectively. Note that any constraint is second-class
for non-degenerate semimetric structure.

20

c) Calculate antisymmetric and symmetric Dirac brackets with respect to
the set of constraints A and B and later take a union of them.

Most interesting cases take place when the set of constraints for the semi-
metric part is a subset of constants of motion for the Poissonian part, i.e.
system is dissipative however some of constants of the Poisson dynamics re-
main constants for the semimetric-Poissonian dynamics. One may use this
feature to design many interesting dissipative systems. As an example, we
illustrate how to design variety of damped rigid body dynamics in the next
section.

6 Applications: Physical Examples

6.1 Particle on the hypersurface with friction

We shall begin our illustration of the Dirac bracket applications by discussion
of a simple example, namely the classical particle moving with friction on a
hypersurface Sconﬁg = {x ∈ Rn | f (x) = 0}. Denote the particle position
by x and its conjugate momentum by p and let the friction force experienced
by that particle be proportional to the particle velocity. The phase space
R2n is now equipped with two structures: canonical Poisson and semimetric
structure. Then the Poisson structure follows is described by

{xi, xj} = 0 = {pi, pj}, {xi, pj} = δij ,

(6.1)

and the semimetric structure is deﬁned by

≺ xi, xj ≻= 0 =≺ xi, pj ≻, ≺ pi, pj ≻= δijλi ,

(6.2)

where λi(x) > 0 is the directional and space dependent damping coeﬃcient.
The semimetric-Poisson structure is deﬁned by {{·, ·}} = {·, ·}− ≺ ·, · ≻.

which can be rewritten in the Newtonian form m¨xi + λi(x) ˙xi − Fi(x) = 0,
where F(x) = − ∂V
∂x is a potential force. In the particular, when λi(x) =
λ(x), we have m¨x + λ(x) ˙x − F(x) = 0.
Next consider a ﬁxed algebraic surface f (x) = 0 in Rn. We make assump-
tions that f is smooth and zero is its regular value. The second assumption

21

ensures that Sconﬁg = f −1(0) is a close regular n−1 dimensional diﬀerential
submanifold in Rn. Moreover this assumption guarantees ∇f 6= 0, so we
can use the gradient to deﬁne the normal vector on Sconﬁg.
The set of constraints consists now of two elements:

Θ1 ≡ f (x) = 0 , Θ2 ≡ p ·

6.2 Variety dynamics of damped rigid body

The usual Poisson brackets for a rigid body angular velocity vector ~ω, after
suitable rescaling, are

{ωi, ωj} =

εijkωk .

(6.11)

Xk

Suppose that there is no second-class constraints for the Poisson part of
the rigid body dynamics and just one such a constraint for its symmetric
part. Assume now that this constraint is such that the system energy (or
any Casimir function for the metric part) is constant. The choice of that
constraint determines details of the semimetric-Poissonian structure.
Using the canonical metric brackets (4.16) and the constrained energy H
from example 4.3 we obtain Dirac metric bracket for rigid body (4.17).
Combining these two structures one ﬁnds the metric-Poissonian brackets for
rigid body [9]:

6.3 Classical damped spins

The Poisson bracket for lattice-spins

{Si

b } = δabεijkSk
a ,

(6.21)

where a labels the spin location and k = 1, 2, 3, guarantees that length of
each spin |Sa| is a Casimir. Our model is based on the assumption that
there are no second-class constraints for the Poissonian part and only one
constraint for the metric part.
Starting from canonical metric bracket (4.11) and using the length of the
spins |Sa| constraint, as in the example 4.2, we obtain the Dirac metric
bracket for lattice-spins (4.13). Combining these two structures one ﬁnds
the metric-Poissonian of lattice spins [8]:

and constrained metric brackets for QM (4.29), which were derived from
the canonical metric bracket for QM (4.28) for the physically important

structure for QM :

(6.28)

(cid:21)

This equation is known as the Gisin dissipative wave equation [11]. Here the
construction of the semimetric bracket ensures that the norm of the state
vector is reserved (so the probability is conserved) since it is a second-class
constraint for the semimetric part. The dissipation of energy follows

In the above equation the equality is achieved for Ψ which are the eigenstates
of the Hamiltonian. The damping in the Gisin equation refers, therefore, to
the transition amplitudes only. When the initial wave packet is constructed
from eigenstates corresponding to energies E ≥ E0 then the ﬁnal state of
the evolution described by eq.
(6.28) is the eigenstate with energy E0.
This property distinguishes the Gisin dissipative wave equation from other
dissipative Schr¨odinger equations.

6.5 Viscous ﬂuid dynamics

In the ﬂuid mechanics the state of an isothermal ﬂuid is described by its
mass density and velocity ﬁelds (̺, u) or by (̺, J) where the current J ﬁeld
equals J = ̺u. The semimetric structure for ﬂuid dynamics[8] follows

7 Final comments

The description of the dissipative systems dynamics is usually undertaken
within the framework of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. The “simpli-
ﬁed” version of the full many-body description often used in applications, for
example in phase transformations physics, statistical theory of turbulence,
granular media dynamics etc. is the kinetic equation for the time evolution
of the “relevant degrees of freedom” distribution function. This equation is
derived making strict assumption about the nature of the ﬂuctuations in the
system – the underlying stochastic process performed by the relevant sys-
tem degrees of freedom in the full phase space of the physical model. The
equations of motion for the coarse grained variables describing the meso- or
macroscopic system properties are obtained from that kinetic equation by
one of the known procedures, which once are well justiﬁed and understood,
and occasionally are just a heuristic chain of semi-mathematical operations.
In this paper we have discussed a novel approach to description of the
dissipative systems dynamics, which is purely algebraic. Instead of making
series of assumptions on the level of microscopic physics of the problem we

28

assume existence of certain algebraic structure, akin to that used in Hamil-
tonian formulation of classical dynamics which permit us to derive meso- or
macroscopic dissipative equations directly from the system free energy. The
basic ingredient of that procedure, the semimetric Leibniz bracket for dy-
namics variables over the whole phase space, is postulated according to our
knowledge about dissipative processes. With knowledge of the Poissonian
structure for non-dissipative part of the system dynamics, the symmetries
of the problem and using Dirac machinery [1] one can derive easily diﬀerent
Dirac structures, which are otherwise hard to postulated, describing dissipa-
tive dynamics. One may use the algorithm proposed here to design variety
dissipative dynamical systems with required conservative observables.

As shown in the paper this permits us to build up the metriplectic dy-
namics scenario for several non-trivial systems: classical particle physics,
many spins dynamics, rigid body dynamics, compressible and incompress-
ible viscous ﬂuid dynamics and some quantum mechanical problems. Several
other applications, notably the relativistic charged particle systems which
can also be formulated within the metriplectic scenario have been discussed
previously [17, 18]. The quantum applications are of particular interest in
view of some similarity between the metriplectic approach and the Lindblads
construction [19] – the standard tool in dissipative quantum system analysis.
We expect to comment on the connection between both these approaches in
the forthcoming publication.

Appendix

A symmetric Leibniz bracket which satisﬁes the SJ-identity is called the SP-
bracket. The tensor G which generates SJ-bracket is called SP-tensor. In

Hence, SP-bracket and SP-tensor are symmetric analogy to Poisson bracket
and Poisson tensor, respectively. In particular each symmetric tensor where
Gij are constants (i.e. do not depends on points), generates a SP-bracket.
For a non-trivial example of SJ-tensor, see Example 7.1.
SP-manifold is a pair (M, G) where G is a symmetric SP-tensor of the type
(2, 0).

is SP-tensor.

Similarly, with the concept of SJ-identity one can deﬁne SL-algebra, SP-
algebra which are symmetric analogy of Lie algebra and Poisson algebra,
respectively. To prove that there is no another symmetric Jacobi identity
we need few elementary algebraic concepts. By an identity of the algebra F
we mean a polynomial P in some free algebra which is identically zero when
the generators are replaced by any elements of F. We are interested on the
3-linear identities in which each term involves two pairs of brackets, i.e. of
the form: a ≺≺ f, g ≻, h ≻ +b ≺≺ f, h ≻, g ≻ +c ≺≺ g, h ≻, f ≻= 0. Now
we would like prove the following result:

Proposition 7.1 There are exactly two types of 3-linear identities for sym-
metric algebra in which each term involves two pairs of brackets:

a) The SE-identity (symmetric version of the Engel identity): ∀f ∈ F:

≺≺ f, f ≻, f ≻= 0.

b) The SJ-identity (symmetric version of the Jacobi identity):

∀f, g : ≺≺ f, f ≻, g ≻=≺≺ f, g ≻, f ≻⇐⇒

∀f, g, h : 2 ≺≺ f, g ≻, h ≻= [≺≺ f, h ≻, g ≻ + ≺≺ g, h ≻, f ≻] .

Proof.
Suppose that a ≺≺ f, g ≻, h ≻ +b ≺≺ f, h ≻, g ≻ +c ≺≺ g, h ≻
, f ≻= 0. For f = g = h we have (a + b + c) ≺≺ f, f ≻, f ≻= 0, therefore
the identity must be of the type a) or a + b + c = 0. If a + b + c = 0, then
for f = h we have (a + c) ≺≺ f, g ≻, f ≻ +b ≺≺ f, f ≻, g ≻= 0, i.e. it must
be of the type b), since a + c = −b.

Similarly, one can prove that there are exactly two 3-linear identities in
which each term involves two pairs of brackets for antisymmetric algebra:

Q.E.D.

a) The Engel identity:

b) The Jacobi identity:

∀f, g : {{f, g}, f } = 0 ⇐⇒ ∀f, g, h : {{f, g}, h} + {{h, g}, f } = 0 .

∀f, g, h : {{f, g}, h} + {{g, h}, f } + {{h, f }, g} = 0 . ✷

30

Even the Jacobi identity and SJ-identity are formally similar as we have
seen above, but there exists also a fundamental diﬀerence between them.
Indeed, the former is equivalent to Xh{f, g} = {Xhf, g} + {f, Xhg}, i.e.
Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds act as derivations for Poisson bracket, but for the
latter 2X D
h f, g ≻ + ≺ f, X D
h g ≻. In the other words, the
Jacobi identity manifests some basic features like cyclicity, derivation and
signature property while the SJ-identity does not.

h ≺ f, g ≻=≺ X D

Furthermore, the most natural symmetric bracket ≺ A, B ≻= AB+BA
does not satisfy the SJ-identity in the general. Hence, there is no natural
representation for SP -algebras.

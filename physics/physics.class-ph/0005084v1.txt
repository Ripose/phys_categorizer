Abstract

Coulomb comes in quanta, weber may come in quanta. – We will base classi-

cal electrodynamics on electric charge conservation, the Lorentz force, and on

magnetic ﬂux conservation. This yields the Maxwell equations. The conse-

quences will be drawn for the interpretation and the dimension of the electric

and magnetic ﬁelds.

I. INTRODUCTION

In Cologne, we teach the course on Theoretical Physics II (electrodynamics) to students

of physics in their fourth semester. Since several years, we are using for that purpose the

calculus of exterior diﬀerential forms, see [1,2], because we believe that this is the appropriate

formalism: It is based on objects with possess a clear operational interpretation, it elucidates

the fundamental structure of Maxwell’s equations and their mutual interrelationship, and

it invites to a 4-dimensional representation appropriate for special and general relativity

theory (i.e., including gravity, see [3,4]).

Our experimental colleagues are somewhat skeptical; and not only them. Therefore we

were invited to give, within 90 minutes, a sort of a popular survey of electrodynamics in

exterior calculus to the members of one of our experimental institutes (group of H. Micklitz).

The present article is a worked-out version of this talk. We believe that it could also be

useful for other universities.

This talk was given on 10 May 2000. The next day we received the new May issue of

the American Journal of Physics. And there we found the highly interesting and historically

oriented article of Roche [5] on “B and H, the intensity vectors of magnetism. . . ”. Therein,

the corresponding work of Bamberg and Sternberg [6], Bopp [7], Ingarden and Jamio lkowski

[8], Post [9], Sommerfeld [10], and Truesdell and Toupin [11], to drop just a few names,

was totally neglected yielding a picture of H and B which looks to us as being out of date;

one should also compare in this context the letter of Chambers [12]. Below we will suggest

answers to some of Roche’s questions.

Moreover, “...any system that gives E and B diﬀerent units, when they are related

through a relativistic transformation, is on the far side of sanity” is an apodictic statement

of Fitch in this journal [13]. In the sequel, we will prove that we are on the far side of sanity:

The absolute dimension of E turns out to be magnetic ﬂux/time and that of B magnetic

ﬂux, see Sec. IV.

According to the audience we want to address, we will skip all mathematical details and

2

take recourse to plausibility considerations. In order to make the paper self-contained, we

present though a brief summary of exterior calculus in the Appendix. A good reference to

the mathematics underlying our presentation is the book of Frankel [14], see also [6] and

[15]. For the experimental side of our subject we refer to Bergmann-Schaefer [16].

As a preview, let us collect essential information about the electromagnetic ﬁeld In Table

I. The explanations will follow below.

It was Maxwell himself who advised us to be very careful in assigning a certain physical

quantity to a mathematical object. As it turns out, the mathematical images of D,H, E, B
are all diﬀerent from each other. This is well encoded in Schouten’s images of the electro-

magnetic ﬁeld, see [15] p. 133.

II. ELECTRIC CHARGE CONSERVATION

The conservation of electric charge was already recognized as fundamental law during

the time of Franklin (around 1750) well before Coulomb discovered his force law in 1785.

Nowadays, at a time, at which one can catch single electrons and single protons and their

antiparticles in traps and can count them individually, we are more sure than ever that

electric charge conservation is a valid fundamental law of nature. Therefore matter carries

as a primary quality something called electric charge which only occurs in positive or negative

units of an elementary charge e (or, in the case of quarks, of 1/3th of it) and which can be

counted. Thus it is justiﬁed to introduce the physical dimension of charge q as a new and

independent concept. Ideally one should measure a charge in units of e/3. However, for

practical reasons, the SI-unit C (coulomb) is used in laboratory physics.

Let us start with the 3-dimensional Euclidean space in which we mark a 3-dimensional

domain V . Hereafter, the local coordinates in this space will be denoted by xa and the time

by t, with the basis vectors ea := ∂a and a, b, . . . = 1, 2, 3. The total charge in the domain

V is given by the integral

3

Q = ZV

ρ ,

(2.1)

where the electric charge density ρ is the 3-form ρ = 1
3! ρabc dxa ∧ dxb ∧ dxc = ρ123 dx1 ∧ dx2 ∧
dx3. Here summation is understood over the indices a, b, c and ρabc = −ρbac = ρbca = . . ., i.e.,
the components ρabc of the charge density 3-form ρ are antisymmetric under the exchange

of two indices, leaving only one independent component ρ123. The wedge ∧ denotes the
(anticommutative) exterior product of two forms, and dx1 ∧ dx2 ∧ dx3 represents the volume
“element”. For our present purpose it is enough to know, for more details see the Appendix,

that a 3-form (a p-form) is an object that, if integrated over a 3-dimensional (p-dimensional)

domain, yields a scalar quantity, here the charge Q.

The dimension of Q is [Q] = q. Since an integral (a summation after all) cannot change

the dimension, the dimension of the charge density 3-form and its components are, respec-

tively, [ρ] = q, and [ρabc] = q/ℓ3, with ℓ = length.

In general, the elementary charges are not at rest. The electric current J ﬂowing across

a 2-dimensional surface S is given by the integral

J = ZS

j .

(2.2)

Accordingly, the electric current density j turns out to be a 2-form: j = 1
2! jab dxa ∧ dxb =
j12 dx1 ∧ dx2 + j13 dx1 ∧ dx3 + j23 dx2 ∧ dx3, with jab = −jba. If t = time, then the dimensions
of the current integral and the current 2-form and its components are [J] = [j] = q/t and

[jab] = q/(t ℓ2), respectively.

If we use the abbreviation ∂t := ∂/∂t, the global electric charge conservation can be

expressed as

∂tZV

ρ + Z∂V

j = 0

(Axiom 1) ,

(2.3)

where the surface integral is evaluated over the (closed and 2-dimensional) boundary of V ,

which we denote by ∂V . The change per time interval of the charge contained in V is

balanced by the ﬂow of the electric current through the boundary of the domain.

4

The closed surface integral R∂V j can be transformed into a volume integral RV d j by

Stokes’s theorem (9.4). Here d denotes the exterior derivative that increases the rank of a

form by one, i.e. d j is a 3-form. Thus (2.3) translates into

(∂tρ + d j) = 0 .

ZV

(2.4)

Since this is valid for an arbitrary domain, we arrive at the local form of electric charge

conservation,

d j + ∂tρ = 0 .

(2.5)

III. EXCITATIONS

Since the charge density ρ is a 3-form, its exterior derivative vanishes: d ρ = 0. Then,

by a theorem of de Rham, it follows that ρ can be derived from a “potential”:

dρ = 0

=⇒

ρ = d D .

(3.1)

In this way one ﬁnds the electric excitation 2-form D. Its absolute dimension is [D] = [ρ] = q,
furthermore, for the components, [Dab] = [D]/ℓ2 = q/ℓ2.

Substituting (3.1)2 into charge conservation (2.5) and once again using the de Rham

theorem, we ﬁnd another “potential” for the current density:

d (j + ∂tD) = 0

=⇒

j + ∂tD = d H .

(3.2)

The magnetic excitation H turns out to be a 1-form.
q/t ,

[Ha] = q/(t ℓ).

Its dimension is [H] = [j] =

Consequently, the excitations (D,H) are potentials of the sources (ρ, j). All these (ad-

ditive) quantities (How much?) are described by odd diﬀerential forms.

In this way, we ﬁnd the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations (the Gauss law and the

Oersted-Amp`ere law):

5

d D = ρ ,
d H − ∂tD = j .

(3.3)

(3.4)

Since electric charge conservation is valid in microphysics, the corresponding Maxwell equa-

tions (3.3) and (3.4) are also microphysical equations, and with them the excitations D and
H are microphysical quantities likewise – in contrast to what is stated in most textbooks.
Before we ever talked about forces on charges, charge conservation alone gave us the

inhomogeneous Maxwell equations including the appropriate dimensions for the excitations

D and H.

Under the assumption that D vanishes inside an ideal electric conductor, one can get rid
of the indeterminacy of D which is inherent in the deﬁnition of the excitation as a “potential”
of the charge density, and we can measure D by means of two identical conducting plates
(“Maxwellian double plates”) which touch each other and which are separated in the D-
ﬁeld to be measured. The charge on one plate is then measured. Analogously, H can be
measured by the Gauss compensation method or by a superconductor and the Meissner eﬀect

(B = 0 → H = 0). Accordingly, the excitations do have a direct operational signiﬁcance.

IV. FIELD STRENGTHS

So far, conserved charge was the notion at center stage. Now energy enters the scene,

which opens the way for introducing the electromagnetic ﬁeld strengths. Whereas the exci-

tations (D,H) are linked to (and measured by) the charge and the current (ρ, j), the electric
and magnetic ﬁeld strengths are usually introduced as forces acting on unit charges at rest

or in motion, respectively.

Let us consider a point particle with electric charge e and velocity vector v. The force

F acting on it is a 1-form since its (1-dimensional) line integral yields a scalar, namely

the energy. Thus F carries the absolute dimension of an energy or of action over time:

[F ] = energy = h/t, where h denotes the dimension of an action. Accordingly, the local

components Fa of the force F = Fa dxa possess the dimension [Fa] = h/(t ℓ) = force.

6

In an electromagnetic ﬁeld, the motion of a test particle is governed by the Lorentz force:

F = e (E − v⌋B)

(Axiom 2) .

(4.1)

The symbol ⌋ denotes the interior product of a vector (here the velocity vector) with a
p-form. It decreases the rank of a form by 1 (see the Appendix), and since v⌋B is to be a
1-form, then B is a 2-form. Newly introduced by (4.1) are the electric ﬁeld strength 1-form

E and the magnetic ﬁeld strength 2-form B. They are both intensities (How strong?).

The dimension of the velocity is [v] = 1/t. With the decomposition v = va∂a, we ﬁnd

for its components [va] = ℓ/t. Then it is straightforward to read oﬀ from (4.1) the absolute

dimension of the electric ﬁeld strength [E] = h/(t q) = φ0/t, with φ0 := h/q. For its

components we have [Ea] = φ0/(t ℓ). Analogously, for the dimension of the magnetic ﬁeld

strength we ﬁnd [B] = (h/t)/(q/t) = h/q = φ0 and [Bab] = φ0/ℓ2, respectively. The ﬁeld B

carries the dimension of a magnetic ﬂux φ0. In superconductors, magnetic ﬂux can come in

quantized ﬂux tubes, so-called ﬂuxoids, underlining the importance of the notion of magnetic

ﬂux.

The deﬁnition (4.1) of the ﬁeld strengths makes only sense, if the charge of the test

particle is conserved. In other words, axiom 2 presupposes axiom 1 and should not be seen

as a stand alone pillar of electrodynamics.

V. MAGNETIC FLUX CONSERVATION

Taking into account the rank (as exterior forms) of the ﬁeld strengths, the only integral

we can build up from E and B, respectively, are line integrals and surface integrals Rline E
and Rsurface B. Apart from a factor t, the dimensions are equal. Hence, from a dimensional

point of view, it seems sensible to postulate the conservation theorem,

∂tZS

B +Z∂S

E = 0

(Axiom 3) .

(5.1)

Magnetic ﬂux conservation (5.1) has to be seen as an analog of electric charge conservation

(2.3). Magnetic ﬂux, though, is related to a 2-dimensional surface whereas electric charge

7

is related to a 3-dimensional volume. Thus the integration domains in the conservation

theorems (5.1) and (2.3) diﬀer by one spatial dimension always.

Axiom 3 gains immediate evidence from the dynamics of an Abrikosov ﬂux line lattice

in a superconductor. There the quantized ﬂux lines can be counted, they don’t vanish nor

are they created from nothing, rather they move in and out crossing the boundary ∂S of

the surface S under consideration.

Again, by means of Stokes’s theorem (9.4), we can transform the boundary integral:

R∂S E = RS d E. Taking into account the arbitrariness of the surface S, we recover Faraday’s

induction law

d E + ∂tB = 0 ,

(5.2)

which is experimentally very well established. We diﬀerentiate Faraday’s law by means of d

and ﬁnd ∂t(d B) = 0. Since an integration constant other than zero is senseless (recall the

relativity principle), we have

d B = 0 .

(5.3)

The homogeneous Maxwell equations (5.2) and (5.3) (Faraday’s induction law and the closure

of the magnetic ﬁeld strength) nearly complete the construction of the theory.

We ﬁnd the 3 + 3 time evolution equations (3.4) and (5.2) for the electromagnetic ﬁeld

(D,H; E, B), i.e., for 6 + 6 components. Before we can ﬁnd solutions of these equations,
we have to reduce the number of variables to 6, i.e., we have to cut them in half. Such a

reduction is achieved by Axiom 4 which establishes the constitutive laws D = D(E, B) and
H = H(E, B).

VI. CONSTITUTIVE EQUATIONS FOR THE VACUUM

In general, the constitutive law gives a nonlinear (and, moreover, nonlocal) relation

between the excitations and the ﬁeld strengths, depending on the structure and the motion

8

of the material medium, see [4]. “It should be needless to remark that while from the

mathematical standpoint a constitutive equation is a postulate or a deﬁnition, the ﬁrst

guide is physical experience, perhaps fortiﬁed by experimental data” [17].

The matter-free space is usually called vacuum (or aether, in the old terminology). Ex-

perience tells us that, for vacuum, we should have the linear relations between the (additive)

quantities and the intensities [18]:

D = ε0

⋆E

and

H =

1
µ0

⋆B.

(6.1)

The proportionality coeﬃcients ε0, µ0 encode all the essential information about the electric

and magnetic properties of the vacuum. The Hodge star operator ⋆ is needed, since we have

to map a 1-form into a 2-form and vice versa or, more generally, a k-form into a (3−k)-form.
Then the operator ⋆ in (6.1) has the dimension of a length or its reciprocal. Note that the

Hodge star depends on the metric of our Euclidean space. Recalling the dimensions of the

excitations and the ﬁeld strengths, we ﬁnd the dimensions of the vacuum permittivity and

the vacuum permeability as

[ε0] =

qt
φ0ℓ

=

1

c Ω0

and

[µ0] =

φ0t
qℓ

=

Ω0
c

,

(6.2)

respectively. Here we deﬁne Ω0 := Φ0/q = h/q2 and velocity c := ℓ/t. Dimensionwise, it is

clearly visible that

"

1

√ε0µ0 # = c ,

and

"s µ0

ε0 # = Ω0 .

(6.3)

Obviously, the velocity c and the resistance Ω0 are constants of nature, the velocity of light

c being a universal one, whereas Ω0, the wave resistance of the vacuum [19], refers only to

electromagnetic properties. Note that 1/Ω0 plays the role of the coupling constant which

enters as a factor into the free ﬁeld Maxwell Lagrangian.

VII. SI-UNITS

The fundamental dimensions in the SI-system for mechanics and electrodynamics are

(ℓ, t, M, q/t), with M as mass. And for each of those a unit was deﬁned. However, since

9

action – we denote its dimension by h – is a relativistic invariant quantity and since the

electric charge is more fundamental than the electric current, we rather choose as the basic

units

(ℓ, t, h, q) ,

(7.1)

see Schouten [15] and Post [9]. Thus, instead of the kilogram and the ampere, we choose

joule×second (or weber×coulomb) and the coulomb:

(m, s, Wb×C, C).

(7.2)

Numerically, in the SI-system, one puts (for historical reasons)

µ0 = 4π × 10−7 Wb s

C m

(permeability of the vacuum).

(7.3)

Then measurements `a la Weber-Kohlrausch yield

ε0 = 8.85 × 10−12 C s

Wb m

(permittivity of the vacuum).

(7.4)

The SI-units of the electromagnetic ﬁeld are collected in Table II.

VIII. ELECTRODYNAMICS IN MATTER

In a great number of the texts on electrodynamics the electric and magnetic properties of

media are described following the macroscopic averaging scheme of Lorentz (1916). However,

this formalism has a number of serious limitations, see the relevant criticism in [20], e.g..

Here we follow a consistent microscopic approach to the electrodynamics in media, cf.

[20]. The total charge or current density is the sum of the two contributions originating

“from the inside” and “from the outside” of the medium:

ρ = ρmat + ρext ,

j = jmat + jext .

(8.1)

Hereafter, the bound charge [21] in matter is denoted by mat and the external charge [22] by

ext. The same notational scheme is also applied to the current and the excitations. Bound

10

charge and bound current are inherent characteristics of matter determined by the medium

itself. They vanish outside the medium. In contrast, external charge and external current in

general do not vanish outside matter. They can be prepared for a speciﬁc purpose (such as

the scattering of a current of particles by a medium or a study of the reaction of a medium

in response to a prescribed conﬁguration of charges and currents).

We assume that the charge bound by matter fulﬁlls the usual conservation law:

d jmat + ∂tρmat = 0 .

(8.2)

Taking into account (2.5), this means that there is no physical exchange (or conversion)

between the bound and the external charges. As a consequence of this assumption, we can
repeat the arguments of Sec.III that will give rise to the corresponding excitations Dmat and
Hmat as “potentials” for the bound charge and the bound current. The conventional names
for these newly introduced excitations are polarization P and magnetization M, i.e.,

Dmat ≡ −P ,

Hmat ≡ M .

(8.3)

The minus sign is conventional, see Kovetz [23]. Thus, in analogy to the inhomogeneous

Maxwell equations, we ﬁnd

− d P = ρmat ,

d M + ∂tP = jmat .

(8.4)

The identiﬁcations (8.3) are only true up to an exact form. However, if we requires Dmat = 0
for E = 0 and Hmat = 0 for B = 0, as we will do in (8.8), uniqueness is guaranteed.

The Maxwell equations are linear partial diﬀerential equations. Therefore we can deﬁne

Dext := D − Dmat = D + P ,

Hext := H − Hmat = H − M .

(8.5)

The external excitations (Dext,Hext) can be understood as auxiliary quantities. In terms of
these quantities, the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations for matter ﬁnally read:

d Dext = ρext ,
d Hext − ∂tDext = jext ,

Dext = ε0
1
Hext =
µ0

⋆E + P (E) ,

⋆B − M(B) .

(8.6)

(8.7)

11

The system (8.6,8.7) look similar to (3.3,3.4). However, these equations refer only to the

external ﬁelds and sources.

In the simplest cases, we have the linear constitutive laws

P = ε0 χE

⋆E ,

M =

1
µ0

χB

⋆B ,

with the electric and magnetic [24] susceptibilities (χE, χB). With material constants

ε := ε0 (1 + χE) ,

µ :=

one can rewrite the material laws (8.8) as

Dext = ε ⋆E ,

H ext =

µ0

1 − χB

,

1
µ

⋆B .

(8.8)

(8.9)

(8.10)

For the discussion of the concrete applications of the developed microscopic theory in

modern condensed matter physics, we refer to the review of Hirst [20].

IX. CONCLUSION

The Maxwell equations

d D = ρ ,
d B = 0 ,

d H − ∂tD = j ,
d E + ∂tB = 0 ,

(9.1)

(9.2)

are the cornerstones of any classical theory of electromagnetism. As an expression of charge

and ﬂux conservation, they carry a high degree of plausibility as well as solid experimental

support. The Maxwell equations in this form remain valid in an accelerated reference frame

and in a gravitational ﬁeld likewise, without any change.

The constitutive equations for the vacuum

D =

1

c Ω0

⋆E

and

H =

c
Ω0

⋆B

(9.3)

are necessary for making the Maxwellian system to a predictive physical theory. They

depend, via the star operator, on the metric of space and are, accordingly, inﬂuenced by

12

the gravitational ﬁeld. They are valid in very good approximation, but there are exceptions

known (if the Casimir eﬀect is to be described).

For the description of matter, the sources (ρ, j) have to be split suitably in order to

derive, from the microscopic equations (9.1) and (9.2), appropriate macroscopic expressions.

Summing up, we can give an answer to one of the central questions posed by Roche [5]:

The need for the diﬀerent notations and diﬀerent dimensions and units for the excitation

H and the ﬁeld strength B (and, similarly, for D and E) is well substantiated by the very
diﬀerent geometrical properties and physical origins of these ﬁelds, see Table I and Schouten

[15] p. 133. Even in vacuum, these diﬀerences do not disappear.

APPENDIX: THE ABC OF EXTERIOR CALCULUS

The formalism of exterior diﬀerential forms is widely used in diﬀerent domains of math-

ematics and theoretical physics. In particular, in electromagnetic theory, exterior calculus

oﬀers an elegant and transparent framework for the introduction of the basic notions and

for the formulation of the corresponding laws. Here, we give a very elementary description

of the objects and operations used above.

Given the set of the local coordinates {xa}, the vectors ea = ∂a represent a basis of the
tangent vector space at a point of the manifold. The symbol dxa denotes the set of the

linear 1-forms dual to the coordinate vector basis, dxa(eb) = δa

b . An arbitrary k-form ω can

be described, in local coordinates, by its components: ω = 1

k! ωa1...ak dxa1 ∧ . . . ∧ dxak.

13

It is common to say that the exterior product “∧” generalizes the vector product. How-
ever, one should be careful with such statements, because the vector product in the stan-

dard 3-dimensional analysis is, strictly speaking, a superposition of the wedge product and

of the Hodge duality operator. Thus, the vector product necessarily involves the metric

on the manifold.

In contrast, the exterior product is a pre-metric operation, although it

resembles the vector product. For example, the exterior product of the two 1-forms ω

and ϕ with the components ωa and ϕa yields a 2-form ω ∧ ϕ with the local components
{(ω2ϕ3 − ω3ϕ2), (ω3ϕ1 − ω1ϕ3), (ω1ϕ2 − ω2ϕ1)}.

The exterior diﬀerential d maps a k-form to a (k + 1)-form. It is most easily described

in the local coordinates: the exterior diﬀerential of a k-form ω = 1

increases its rank and yields the (k + 1)-form dω = 1

k! ωa1...ak dxa1 ∧ . . . ∧ dxak
(k+1)! (cid:16)∂[a1ωa1...ak+1](cid:17) dxa1 ∧ . . . ∧ dxak+1.

Thus, d naturally generalizes the “grad” operator which leads from a scalar to a vector and,

at the same time, it represents a pre-metric extension of the “curl” operator.

Conversely, one can deﬁne an operation which decreases the rank of a form by 1. This is

the interior product of a vector with a k-form. Given the vector v with the components va,

the interior product with the coframe 1-form yields v⌋dxa = va, which is a sort of a projection
along v. By linearity, the interior product of v with the k-form ω = 1
k! ωa1...ak dxa1 ∧. . .∧dxak
yields a (k − 1)-form v⌋ω = 1

(k−1)! vaωaa1 ...ak−1 dxa1 ∧ . . . ∧ dxak−1.

The notions of the odd and even exterior forms are closely related to the orientation of

the manifold. In simple terms, these two types of forms are distinguished by their diﬀerent

behavior with respect to a reﬂection (i.e., a change of orientation): an even (odd) form does

not change (changes) sign under a reﬂection transformation. These properties of odd and

even forms are crucial in the integration theory, see, e.g., [14].

For a k-form an integral over a k-dimensional surface is deﬁned. We will not enter into

the details here, limiting ourselves to the formulation of the Stokes’s theorem which occupies

the central place in the integration theory:

Z∂C

ω = ZC

d ω.

14

(9.4)

Here ω is an arbitrary k-form, and C is an arbitrary (k + 1)-dimensional (hyper)surface.

For a deeper and a more rigorous introduction into the exterior calculus, see, e.g., [6,14].

[18] Alternatively, between the extensive and the intensive quantities. In electrodynamics,

the distinction between these two types of quantities goes back to Mie. He also suggested

the name excitation (in German: Erregung) for D and H, see G. Mie: Lehrbuch der
Elektrizit¨at und des Magnetismus. 3rd ed.. Enke, Stuttgart (1948).

[24] In older texts, the magnetization M was usually expressed in terms of H, namely M =

χH H. For reasons of relativistic invariance, this is inappropriate, provided we start with

P = ε0 χE

⋆E, as we do in (8.8)2. Note that µ = µ0(1 + χH).

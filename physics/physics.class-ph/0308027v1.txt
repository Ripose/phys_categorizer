Abstract

This is a late answer to question #79 by R.I. Khrapko, “Does plane wave
not carry a spin?,” Am. J. Phys. 69, 405 (2001), and a complement (for
massless spin 2, and massive spin 1
2 and 1) to the paper by H.C. Ohanian,
What is spin?, Am. J. Phys. 54, 500–505 (1985). In particular, it is shown
that “spin” is a classical quantity that can be calculated for any ﬁeld using its
deﬁnition, namely that it is just the non-local part of the conserved angular
momentum. This leads to explicit expressions which are bilinear in the ﬁelds
and which agree with their standard “quantum” counterparts.

The problem of deﬁning and calculating the intrinsic “spin” carried by plane
waves is a recurring question (see, e.g., [1, 2]) even though it has been deﬁnitely
clariﬁed sixty years ago by J. Humblet who recognized that such a deﬁnition is
only possible for a wave-packet, that is a superposition of plane waves conﬁned
to a bounded four-dimensional region of space-time [3, p.596]. This concept is in
agreement with standard text books which make clear that plane waves of inﬁnite
extent are just mathematical idealizations and that physical waves correspond to
“ﬁelds produced a ﬁnite time in the past (and so localized to a ﬁnite region of
space)” [4, p.333]. More generally, this concept agrees with Julian Schwinger’s
fundamental idea of source theory, namely that “a physical description refers
only to the ﬁnite space-time region which is under the experimenter’s control” [7,
p.78]. Finally, in practical calculations, this concepts leads to a simple recipe,
applicable in many cases, which consists of approximating a wave packet by a
plane wave provided it is assumed that all contributions coming from inﬁnitely
remote space-time points are zero.

It is therefore not surprising that the paper of H.C. Ohanian [1], as well as both
answers to R.I. Khrapko’s question [2], i.e., [5, 6], are essentially based on this
concept. There is nevertheless something unsatisfactory in this paper and these
answers, which mostly focus on the spin 1 electromagnetic ﬁeld: What about
spin 1
2 electrons, massive spin 1 particles, and possibly higher spin ﬁelds such
as spin 2 gravitation? Is there a simple, classical, i.e., “non-quantal” approach
showing that these ﬁelds have indeed spin 1

2, 1, or 2 ?

In the case of massless spin 1 particles, i.e., the electromagnetic ﬁeld, Ohanian
showed that the angular momentum ~M of a wave-packet can be decomposed into
two part, ~M (~r) = ~L(~r) + ~S where by use of Gauss’s theorem one of the parts is
found to be non-local, i.e., independent of the spacetime point ~r. This part, ~S,
therefore corresponds to an intrinsic angular moment carried by the wave-packet
as a whole. Written in terms of the electric ﬁeld ~E and the vector potential ~A, the
volume density of this “spin” angular momentum is d~S
dV = ~E × ~A, while the energy
2( ~E · ~E + ~B · ~B) where ~B is the magnetic ﬁeld. The normalized
density is dU
spin content of a wave packet is therefore

dV = 1

d~S
dU

=

~E × ~A
2( ~E · ~E + ~B · ~B)

(2)

which is essentially Humblet’s result [3], conﬁrmed by Jackson [4, p.333], Ohanian
[1], and many others.

In the case of a massive spin 1 ﬁeld one has to use Proca’s equations instead
of Maxwell’s. It turns out that the calculations made in the case of Maxwell’s
ﬁeld can be repeated with the difference that the vector ﬁelds ~E and ~B, as well as
the vector and scalar potentials ~A and φ, are now complex. The normalized spin
content of a Proca wave packet is then

d~S
dU

=

2( ~E × ~A∗ + ~E∗ × ~A)

1

2( ~E · ~E∗ + ~B · ~B∗) + 1

2m2(φφ∗ + ~A · ~A∗)

which reduces to (1) for a real ﬁeld of mass m = 0.

Turning to the case of a spin 1

2 ﬁeld one meets the difﬁculty that the Dirac ﬁeld
is not a “classical” ﬁeld in the sense that it is usually not expressed (as the Maxwell
and Proca ﬁelds) in terms of scalars and three-dimensional vectors. This is the
reason why in the paper of Ohanian there is no explicit calculation showing that the
spin of Dirac’s ﬁeld for an electron is indeed 1
2. Fortunately, there is a formulation
of Dirac’s theory (available since 1929!) which enables such a calculations to be
made in a straight forward manner, and which allows a direct comparison with the
Maxwell and Proca ﬁelds. In this formulation the four complex components of
the Dirac ﬁeld correspond to a scalar s and a three-dimensional vector ~v, which
are combined into a complex quaternion D = s + ~v obeying the Dirac-Lanczos
equation

∇D = mD∗i~ν
(3)
where ∇ is the 4-dimensional gradient operator and ~ν a unit vector [8]. This
equation, which is fully equivalent to Dirac’s equation, has many remarkable

2

properties which stem from the fact that it is written in the smallest possible
algebra in which the Dirac electron theory can be expressed [9, 10]. In the present
application, following the procedure which lead to equations (1) and (2), and
without using any “quantum mechanical” operator or rule such as projecting onto
a subspace or calculating a “Hilbert space scalar-product,” one directly ﬁnds that
the normalized spin content of an electron wave packet is given by

2 explicitly showing that the electron ﬁeld has spin 1

which has an overall factor 1
2. In
(3, 4) the operator ( ) means changing the sign of the vector part, i.e., s + ~v = s−~v,
while S[ ] and V[ ] mean taking the scalar, respectively vector, part of the quaternion
expression within the square brackets.

We see that there is a great similarity between expressions (1, 2) and (4). The
denominator is always the energy density which is obtained from the scalar part
of the Poynting 4-vector, while the numerator is the vector part of the spin angular
momentum pseudo 4-vector, i.e., Di~νD
in Lanczos’s formulation of Dirac’s
theory [11].

In principle, the method used here can be generalized to any spin. However,
in the case of spin 2, it is simpler to refer to standard text books in which the
gravitational angular momentum and energy radiation rates of a point mass are
calculated in terms of the reduced mass quadrupole moments Qjk, e.g., [12, p.357]
and [13, p.994]. This leads to the expressions

which after division by one another show that gravitational radiation has spin 2,
as is conﬁrmed by comparing with the corresponding expressions for the elec-
tromagnetic angular momentum and energy radiation rates of a point charge of
4-velocity ˙Z and electric charge e, see, e.g., [12, p.175, p.206]

where < ... > means that the bracketed quantities are integrated over a closed
surface surrounding the point mass or charge.

In conclusion, the “spin” content of any ﬁeld can be deﬁned and calculated
without any reference to quantum theory. In particular, if a polarized plane wave
is used to calculate expressions (1, 2) or (4) one obtains a result that is 1 or 1
2 times

a normalized unit of angular momentum. If the corresponding wave is attributed
to a single quantum such as a photon or an electron, this unit can be taken as the
measured value of ~. However, in order to consistently deal with ﬁelds containing
a single or a small number of quanta, the classical theory is not sufﬁcient: It
must be supplemented by a quantum interpretation in which the ﬁelds themselves
become dynamical variables [4, p.751]. Finally, it is clear that “spin” has nothing
to do with a vortex or a whirl which would be carried by a wave or a wave-packet:
It is simply the non-local part of the angular momentum that derives from the
dynamics implied by the wave-equations deﬁning the ﬁeld.

[9] In Dirac’s formulation the 4-complex-component electron ﬁeld is taken as a
4 × 1 column vector Ψ, and the linear operators are 4 × 4 complex matrices
∈ M4(C).
In Lanczos’s formulation the same 4-complex-component ﬁeld is a bi-
quaternion D ∈ B = M2(C) = Cℓ1,2. The linear operators are then linear

4

biquaternions functions of biquaternions, which are isomorphic to the alge-
bra of 4 × 4 complex matrices M4(C) = M2(B) = Cℓ4,1.
In both formulations the operator space has 4 × 4 × 2 = 32 dimensions
over the reals. The difference is that in the Dirac formulation the ﬁeld is
an abstract 4-component column vector, while in the Lanczos formulation
the ﬁeld is directly related to the algebraic structure of spacetime because a
biquaternion D = s + ~v is the direct sum of a scalar s and a 3-component
vector ~v.

Lanczos’s formulation is therefore more suitable than Dirac’s for studying
and demonstrating the “classical” aspects of the electron ﬁeld, and for
making comparisons with the Maxwell and Proca ﬁelds which are usually
expressed in terms of scalars and vectors.

Finally, in terms of Clifford algebras, the Dirac ﬁeld Ψ is a degenerate 8-
real-component element of the 32-dimensional Clifford algebra Cℓ4,1 (i.e.,
an element of an ideal of that algebra) while the Lanczos ﬁeld D is any 8-
real-component element of the 8-dimensional Clifford algebra Cℓ1,2 = B,
which is therefore the smallest algebra in which Dirac’s electron theory can
be fully expressed.

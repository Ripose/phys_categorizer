Abstract

A new relativistic invariant version of nonlinear Maxwell equations is of-

ferred. Some properties of these equations are considered.

The nonlinear equations of theoretical and mathematical physics attract the
signiﬁcant attention because of the speciﬁc properties such, as the absence of the
superposition principle, the nonlinear ﬁelds interactions, existence of the soliton
solutions. The nonlinear equations in electrodynamics were oﬀered for the ﬁrst
time by Born [1], Born and Infeld [2], and also Schr¨odinger [3] outcoming from the
variational principle. Later Fuschich and Tsifra [4], Fuschich [5], Fuschich, Tsifra and
Bouko [6] have applied to this goal the theoretic-algebraic approach. The purpose
of the present work is the formulation of Lorentz and Poincar´e-invariant equations
with the help of the variable replacement method.

Let us introduce the one dimensional Lorentz transformations [7]

Here E, H are the electric and magnetic ﬁelds; ρ, µ are the densities of electromag-
netic charges; v, w are the charge velocities; Φ1, Φ2 are arbitrary functions of Lorentz
and Poincar´e invariants of ﬁelds I1 = 2(E2
H2), I2 = (E.H)2 [3]. In prooﬁng the
invariance of the equations it is necessary to take into account: the invariance of the
speed of light; the transformation properties of the electromagnetic ﬁelds and charge
densities; the law of transformation of velocities; the invariance of the functions Φ1
and Φ2.

Because of arbitrariness of the functions Φ1 and Φ2 system (2) contains the
inﬁnite set of particular realizations of nonlinear Maxwell equations, among which
it is possible to indicate the following base versions:

the linear free Maxwell equations [3] with ρ = µ = 0;

the linear one-charge Maxwell equations [3] with Φ1 = Φ2 = 1, µ = 0;

the linear two-charge Maxwell equations [8] with Φ1 = Φ2 = 1.

Let us note some general properties of these nonlinear equations induced.

The equations (2) become not only relativistic, but also conformal invariant, if
the functions are Φ1(I 2
1 /I2). The statement results from the proof of
conformal symmetry of linear Maxwell equations and identical conformal dimension
of the values I 2

1 /I2), Φ2(I 2

1 and I2.

Equations (2) become linear in absence of currents and charges and so contain

the classical electrodynamics of the free ﬁelds.

Generally, the nonlinearity is conditioned by currents and charges.
The equations keep the possibility of electromagnetic ﬁeld deﬁnition through the

two-potentials Aa = (φ, A), Ba = (Φ, B), a = 0, 1, 2, 3 [9]

dynamics with A = 0 the scalar potential φ satisﬁes the nonlinear Laplace-Poisson

Let us write the equations (2) in some other form. We divide their right parts
into the functions Φ1 and Φ2, designate 1/Φ1 = F1, 1/Φ2 = F2 and instead of ρ(x),
µ(x), J = ρ(x)v/c, K = µ(x)w/c we take the new values

We will refer the densities of charges and currents ρ, µ, J and K to as the initial
ones, and the values corresponding them do to as the eﬀective ones. Then it is
possible to say that the nonlinear microscopic equations of electrodynamics are the
equations which contain the eﬀective values of charge densities and current densities
instead of the initial ones [10]

These equations realize the principle of self-action: the initial charges generate elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds which in its turn inﬂuence on the initial charges, their densities
and sizes up to reaching the equilibrium state with the generating ﬁelds. So, in the
nonlinear versions of the Maxwell and D’Alembert equations (14), (15) the electro-
magnetic charges

Q = Z

receive at least partly the ﬁeld nature. This property of a charge is absent in
the linear electrodynamics. The eﬀective charges Q and P keep the property of
Lorentz-invariance owing to the invariance of functions F1 and F2, and are integrals
of movement due to the existance of the continuity equations

It followes from the equations (17) that the initial charges are not conserved. For

Here ds is the element of the area surrounding the volume element d3x as usually.
The change of the charge q is conditioned not only by the density of current j = ρv,
but by the change of the ﬁeld invariant F1(I1, I2) in time and space.

As far as the nonlinear Maxwell equations satisfy the requirement of relativistic
invariance, they have the potential interest to physics.
In addition to the known
general theoretical questions of electrical charge stability and nature of its mass
[3], it is possible to point out also the ﬁeld nature of a charge and the necessity of
experimental veriﬁcation of the Coulomb law at short distances. The existance of
equations (14) prompt us also to induce the relativistic invariant action integral in
case of the one charge electrodynamics in more general form

According to (19) we can indicate the six versions of Maxwell electrodynamics

with the invariant speed of light:

the classical linear electrodynamics with Ψ1 = Ψ2 = Ψ3 = 1 [3], [7];

the linear electrodynamics with Ψ1

the nonlinear electrodynamics of the ﬁrst type with Ψ3

= 1, Ψ1 = Ψ2 = 1;

the nonlinear electrodynamics of the second type with Ψ2

the nonlinear electrodynamics of the third type with Ψ2

= 1, Ψ1 = 1;

the nonlinear electrodynamics of the fourth type with all functions Ψ

= 1.

equation (11) may be written as follows:

(q/2πr2)(a/√π)exp(
a2r2); ρ2 = (q/2πr2)(a/π)(sinar/ar), q is the electrical
charge, r = (x2 + y2 + z2)1/2, α = k/a, k is the proportionality coeﬃcient, a is
the parameter with inverse length dimension (1/cm). Tending a

where the solution of the equation has the known form φ = q/r. One can see,
that the linear theory is the theory with point-charges. The nonlinear theory is the
theory with the density of charges distributed over space. Densities of charges ρ1
and ρ2 correspond to the various physical models of charges.

The others versions were not investigated. They can be accompanied by the

dependence of the eﬀective mass on the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

In addition to these six versions, it is possible to formulate the nonlinear electro-
dynamics with the noninvariant speed of light. The model of this type was proposed
by Fushchich [5].

Regularization of the second-order partial derivatives of the
Coulomb potential of a point charge∗

Abstract

The second-order partial derivatives of the Coulomb potential of a point charge can be
regularized using the Coulomb potential of a charge of the oblate spheroidal shape that a moving
rest-frame-spherical charge acquires by the Lorentz contraction. This ‘physical’ regularization is
shown to be fully equivalent to the standard delta-function identity involving these derivatives.

Quantities with a singularity of the type 1/r3 at the origin r = 0 occur in classical electrody-
namics in connection with the idealization of a point charge distribution. For example, the
straightforward calculation of the second-order partial derivatives of the Coulomb potential
1/r of a unit point charge yields ∂2r−1/∂xi∂xj = (3xixj −
r2δij)/r5, or the ﬁeld of a point
electric or magnetic dipole, obtained as the straightforward gradient of a potential with
radial dependence 1/r2, has the radial dependence 1/r3. Because of the 1/r3 singularity at
the origin, the integral of such a quantity over any three-dimensional region that includes
the origin r = 0 does not exist even in the improper-integral sense: the value of the integral
V0 around the origin and taking the
obtained by excluding from the integration a region
limit
V0. Integrals involving derivatives of
0 depends on the shape and orientation of
1/r2 or second-order derivatives of 1/r therefore have to be suitably regularized. A formal
way of doing that is to use the delta-function identity [1]

δijδ(r)

where δij is the Kronecker delta symbol and δ(r) = δ(x1)δ(x2)δ(x3) is the three-dimensional
delta function. The validity of the identity (1) can be justiﬁed most easily by the use of the
straightforward regularization 1/(r2 + a2)1/2 of the singular potential 1/r:

since here the second term on the right-hand side is a well-known representation of
3 πδijδ(r) (e.g., see [2]). The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of the identity (1) is as

regularization of this term; of course, the limits a
0 are understood to be taken only after
a three-dimensional integration with a well-behaved ‘test’ function. Regularizing the term

eﬀectively in the form (3).

In a recent paper on the Coulomb-gauge vector potential of a uniformly moving point
charge [3], an occasion has arisen of using the delta-function identity (3) for the regularization
of an integral of the type
i in terms of which the diﬀerence between the
Coulomb- and Lorenz-gauge vector potentials in that problem can be obtained as the solution
to a Poisson equation. Since the relation (3) is an identity, there should be no doubt as to the
correctness of such a formal regularization, but, in a problem that concerns a moving charge,
it would be reassuring if one could show that a more ‘physical’ regularization procedure will
yield the same results. Physically, it is natural to regularize the Coulomb potential 1/r of
a moving point charge by the Coulomb potential of a charge that has the oblate spheroidal
shape that a moving rest-frame-spherical ‘elementary’ charge of ﬁnite extension a acquires
by the Lorentz contraction, and then to take the limit a
0 of any integral involving
second-order derivatives of this potential. Such regularization would involve an ‘ellipsoidal’
approach toward the singularity at the origin because of the spheroidal shape of the moving
elementary charge—in contrast to the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of identity (3) that
stipulates a ‘spherical’ approach toward this singularity. In this note, we demonstrate that a
physical regularization along the above lines is indeed fully equivalent to the delta-function
identity (3).

As a preliminary, we note that a ‘physical’ justiﬁcation of the well-known delta-function
4πδ(r) can be provided very simply. Let ϕa(r) be the Coulomb poten-
identity
tial of a unit elementary charge described by the density ρa(r) = (1/Va)Θ(a2

where Va = 4
3πa3/γ, which is the density of a uniformly charged spheroid with semiaxes a/γ,

a, a, centred at the origin. If γ = (1
moving with a velocity v along the x1-axis and that is a uniform ball of radius a in its rest
frame. Then, for any well-behaved test function f (r), we have by the fact that the potential

Apart from a uniformly charged ball, a uniformly charged spherical shell, or a charged
spherical conductor, was the most popular model of an elementary charge employed in
the classical electron theory (see, e.g., [4]). The Coulomb potential of a uniformly moving
charged conductor that is spherical with radius a in its rest frame is the most convenient
one to use for our purpose because it turns out that it exactly equals the Coulomb potential
of a charged conducting oblate spheroid of semiaxes a/γ, a, a, with the semiaxis a/γ being
directed along the direction of motion (see [5]; an interesting historical background to the
problem of a moving charged sphere can be found in [6]). This potential can be expressed
in terms of an elementary function [7]:

(22) and (23) are independent of a, and using these results and (21), we obtain (19). This
completes the proof of the regularization equivalence (18).

In closing, we note that the regularization equivalence (18) is bound to hold also when
the potential ϕa(r) is the Coulomb potential of a uniformly charged spheroid instead that of
the charged conducting spheroid. However, explicit expressions [8–10] for such a potential
involve special functions and are rather more complicated than the conducting-spheroid
expression (7).

The author acknowledges correspondence with V V Onoochin, whose doubts whether
the delta-function identity (3) is equivalent to the regularization employing the Coulomb
potential of a moving, and thus nonspherical, elementary charge motivated this note.

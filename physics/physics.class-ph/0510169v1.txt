Summary. A test of Lorentz invariance for electromagnetic waves was performed
by comparing the resonance frequencies of two stable optical resonators as a function
of orientation in space. The crystalline resonators were operated at 3.4 K in a cryostat
employing a pulse-tube refrigerator. A new analysis yields the Robertson-Mansouri-

1.1 Introduction

The isotropy of space is a well-tested symmetry of nature [1]. Because it is a
foundation of today’s accepted theories of the fundamental forces it continues
to be the focus of both theoretical and experimental studies. A series of ex-
periments [2, 3, 4] have recently been performed with the goal of improving
the limits for a hypothetical violation. They were in part motivated by the
development of an extension of the Standard Model (SME) by Kosteleck´y and
coworkers [5, 6] that describes Lorentz violation in a comprehensive way. This
dynamical test theory indicates that isotropy violation, if it exists, may ex-
hibit characteristics that diﬀer from those of previous kinematic test theories,
such as the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl (RMS) theory [7].

Here, we will not discuss the conceptual frameworks used to describe hy-
pothetical violations of isotropy, since this is reported in the literature and
is also treated in this Proceedings volume. In this contribution, we limit our-
selves to the description of an experiment used to perform an improved test
of the isotropy of the speed of light. The experiment has already been pre-
sented previously [8]; here we give a more detailed description and report an
extension of the data analysis.

The experiment was conceived as an actively rotated Michelson-Morley
experiment using ultrastable optical cavities interrogated by lasers. It was a
natural extension of our previous work with stationary resonators [3, 9], but
employed a completely new apparatus, except for the sapphire optical cavities.

The experiment consists in measuring the diﬀerence (beat) ν1 −ν2 between
the frequencies of two longitudinal modes of two orthogonal standing-wave
cavities as a function of orientation in space. If isotropy is violated, according
to the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl test theory and the Standard Model exten-
sion, the beat frequency will vary as

δ(ν1(t) − ν2(t))
ν

= 2B(t) sin 2θ(t) + 2C(t) cos 2θ(t),

(1.1)

where ν1 ≈ ν2 ≈ ν is the average frequency (2.8 · 1014 Hz in this experiment)
and θ(t) is the angle between one cavity’s axis relative to the south direction.
In the RMS test theory, the amplitudes 2B(t) and 2C(t) are proportional
to the parameter combination β−δ−1/2, where β, δ parametrize deviations of
the frame transformation equations from the usual Lorentz form. The explicit
form is given below.

In the SME test theory [5], each amplitude 2B(t) and 2C(t) is a linear
combination of eight coeﬃcients weighted by time-harmonic factors. The am-
plitude B(t) contains frequency components at 0, ω⊕, 2ω⊕, ω⊕ ± Ω⊕ and
2ω⊕ ± Ω⊕, while C(t) contains in addition one component at the frequency
Ω⊕. Here ω⊕ is Earth’s sidereal angular frequency and Ω⊕ is Earth’s orbital
frequency. The determination of the individual ˜κo+ coeﬃcients requires the
ability to resolve the contribution of Earth’s orbital motion in order to discrim-
inate between modulation frequencies diﬀering by Ω⊕. Thus a measurement
extending over at least 1 year is necessary. However, in this experiment we
concentrated on a single parameter, (˜κe−)ZZ , and using previous results for
the remaining parameters, it was possible to obtain a result within a much
shorter measurement time.

1.2 Experimental setup

An overall view of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1.1. The whole setup
was actively rotated by a computer-controlled precision ball bearing turntable.
The turntable itself rested on an optical table (3 m × 1.5 m) that was not
ﬂoated. An octagonal base plate mounted on the turntable carried most of the
components, except for the vacuum forepump, the Helium compressor, and
a synthesizer. The cryostat was attached via columns to a plate that could
be rested on top of a rack mounted on the base plate. Cryostat and plate
could be removed from the rack for opening. On the plate the rotary valve
and its driver, temperature controllers, dataloggers, synthesizers and power
supplies were installed. The servo systems for the cavity frequency locks and
the laser power stabilizations were mounted on the sides of the rack. The
laser systems, enclosed by boxes, were located on a breadboard placed on the
octagonal base plate. The beat frequency detector was contained in one of the
boxes. Thermal insulation (not shown in the ﬁgure) was used to shield several
of the components of the setup.

1.2.1 The cryogenics

The cryostat is sketched in Fig. 1.2. Cooling was implemented by a two-stage
pulse-tube cooler [10] (Transmit GmbH), using high pressure (18 bar) Helium
as working medium. The ﬁrst stage had a high cooling power (6 W at 50 K) and
reached a temperature of approx. 41 K, while the second had a lower cooling
power (approx. 0.2 W at 3 K) but was able to reach a minimum temperature
of about 2.2 K without load, and 3.2 K when loaded with the experimental
set-up used for this experiment. The cooler was driven by a water-cooled
Helium compressor (Leybold) with 6 kW power consumption. A signiﬁcant
advantage of this novel cooler type compared to standard cryocoolers is the
absence of moving parts inside the cryostat; only the He gas moves within
the cryostat, under periodically modulated pressure. Mechanical motion was,
however, present in the rotary valve on the top plate. As a consequency, the
displacement of the resonators was modulated at the rotary valve frequency,
with an amplitude of approx. 1 µm vertically and horizontally, as determined
from the propagation of the laser beam exiting the cavities.

An optical cryostat was used, containing three free-space optical access
ports: two half-inch diameter windows for horizontal access and an additional
window located at the bottom (not used here). Anti-reﬂection-coated BK7

was used as window material. To avoid backreﬂections, the windows’ normals
are angled with respect to the beam direction. The lateral ports were used
during the laser alignment and frequency lock phases to identify the cavity
modes excited by the lasers.

A copper heat shield (thermal screen) was attached to the ﬁrst stage cold
plate. To improve shielding from the 300 K vacuum can, it also contained
angled windows. The space available below the second stage cold plate was
about 30 cm in height and 30 cm in diameter. The experimental assembly
consisted of an upper plate, four columns, and a bottom optical bench plate, all
made of copper, rigidly connected together. It was attached to the top ﬂange
by 3 hollow stainless steel rods of 40 cm length, which were heat sunk to the
ﬁrst stage cold plate but not to the second stage cold plate [11]. Copper mesh
provided the thermal link between the experimental assembly and the second
stage cold plate. The assembly was thermally shielded by superinsulation foils.
A turbo pump was used to continously evacuate the chamber. The top
ﬂange of the cryostat contained twelve KF ﬂanges that were used for electrical
signal and optical ﬁber vacuum feedthroughs.

After evacuation of the cryostat, the cool-down time to 3.2 K was about

12 hours.

On a timescale of 10 min, the temperature of the ﬁrst stage varied by less
than 0.1 K. On the optical bench plate, where the cavities are located, the

variations were signiﬁcantly lower, with a 4 mK short-time (10 s) temperature
instability and 50 mK instability over long times (10 h). These variations came
from (small) instabilities of the pulse-tube cooler itself, and from a dependence
of the temperature of the cold stages on the ambient temperature. To reduce
these variations, the temperature of the resonators was kept stable at a value
slightly above the second stage temperature by active temperature control.
A combination of a heater attached to the underside of the optical bench
plate, equidistant from the two optical resonators, and a high sensitivity thin
ﬁlm sensor ﬁxed to one resonator housing, together with a commercial digital
temperature controller was used, and kept the temperature constant at 3.4 K.

1.2.2 The optics setup

An overview of the functional parts of the laser and resonator system is shown
in Fig. 1.3, and the components on the optics base plate are shown in Fig. 1.4.
The two optical resonators are made of pure sapphire (Al2O3) [12]. Each
consists of a 3 cm long cylindrical spacer with inner diameter 1.0 cm, outer
diameter 2.6 cm, and crystal c-axis parallel to the cylinder axis. The sapphire
mirrors have 1 m radius of curvature and are optically contacted to the spacer.
A small hole perpendicular to the cavity axis serves for evacuation. The mir-
rors are coated for high reﬂection at 1064 nm. These resonators were already
used for relativity tests [3, 9, 13, 14]. The linewidths of the two resonators
were 100 kHz at the time of the experiment.

Fig. 1.4. View of the main cryogenic optical components located on the optics
bench plate, without electrical cables and optical ﬁbers. The resonator housings
shown were later replaced by gold-plated copper housings.

Sapphire was chosen because of its very low thermal expansion coeﬃcient
at cryogenic temperature and its low dimensional drift [13]. For dielectric
crystals, the thermal expansion is due solely to phonons and therefore the
expansion coeﬃcient drops as T 3 as the temperature T approaches zero. For
sapphire the value at 3.4 K is approx. 8·10−11 K−1 [15]. We note, however, that
the eﬀective expansion coeﬃcient of a mounted cavity can diﬀer substantially,
because it also involves the interaction of the resonator with its holder. Thus,
in past experiments we have found zero crossings of the thermal expansion
coeﬃcient at 3 K [16].

In the present setup, the two resonators were mounted in two housings
made of invar and coated with a 5 µm thick gold layer. Gold was used to
obtain good contact between the resonators and their housings. The resonators
were then ﬁxed to the housing using thin copper straps. The straps were not
strongly tightened, to avoid squeezing the resonators because of contraction
of the straps during cool-down.

The laser beams were transported to the cavities via two 4 m long polarization-

maintaining single-mode ﬁbers with 8◦ angled ﬁber ends (to avoid back re-
ﬂections and miminize etalon eﬀects). The ﬁber ends were connected to ﬁber
couplers containing short focal length lenses and rigidly attached to the optical
base plate. For each laser beam, two adjustable vacuum compatible stainless
steel mirror mounts deﬂected the light toward a 90% reﬂection/10% transmis-
sion beam splitter placed just before the cavity. The light directly reﬂected
from the beam splitter reached a 2 mm diameter InGaAs photodiode that pro-

1 A precision test of speed of light isotropy

vided the signal for power monitoring and stabilization. The transmitted light
was reﬂected by the cavity, then partially by the beam splitter and was sent
to another photodetector of the same type to provide the signal for frequency
locking.

The alignment of the laser beams was done at room temperature with
the cryostat open. After cooling, the lasers were locked to the TEM00 modes,
which could be identiﬁed with the help of CCD cameras that monitored the
cavity light leaving the cryostat through the windows. The coupling eﬃciency
was typically 10% at room temperature. The eﬃciency was reduced by a factor
2 in the cold state due to diﬀerential thermal contraction eﬀects.

Two diode-pumped monolithic non-planar ring oscillator Nd:YAG lasers
emitting 200 mW at 1064 nm were used. The power fed into the ﬁbers was
about 1.5 mW. The Drever-Hall reﬂection locking scheme was used [17]. The
lasers were phase modulated at frequencies of 300 kHz via the piezoelectric
actuators acting on the laser crystals [18]. The error signals had typical SNR
> 10 in a bandwidth of 100 kHz after ampliﬁcation. They were processed
by respective analog servos, each employing a loop for the laser piezoelectric
actuator (unity gain coeﬃcient at about 15 kHz) and a slow loop for laser
crystal temperature control. The accuracy of the servo electronics was better
than 0.1 Hz at 100 s integration time.

The power of each laser beam incident on the cavities was about 50 to
100 µW and was actively stabilized to a relative level of 1 · 10−4 using an
acousto-optical modulator (AOM) placed before the ﬁber outside the cryostat.
The AOMs also served as optical isolators.

On the laser breadboard, two parts of the laser beams were superimposed
on a fast photodiode, producing a heterodyne signal at the beat frequency
ν1 − ν2, about 700 MHz. This frequency was mixed down with a synthesizer to
a frequency of about 10 MHz, to exploit the higher accuracy of the counter at
lower frequencies. Both synthesizer and frequency counter were phase-locked
to the 5 MHz output of a hydrogen maser.

1.3 Characterization of the setup

After cool-down, the beat frequency initially exhibited a drift on the order of
1 Hz/s. After 2 months, this was reduced to 0.02 Hz/s. Our following discussion
refers to this stable regime of operation.

A main characteristic of the apparatus, the frequency instability of the
beat, is shown in Fig. 1.5. The root Allan variance (RAV) exhibits a peak at
about 7 s. This is due to the modulation of the beat frequency by the pulse-
tube cooler with peak-peak amplitude of about 400 Hz. Although the cooler
has a mechanical frequency at 1.1 Hz, this frequency was aliased to a lower
frequency by the 1 s sampling time of the frequency counter. The minimum
RAV (7 · 10−15) is attained at τ = 20 − 30 s. At the half-period of the rotation,
300 s, the RAV has increased to 1.4 · 10−14. The main reasons for this level

appear to have been due to a low signal-to-noise ratio of the error signal
and to the presence of mechanical/thermal noise from the cooler components
and from the laboratory. These RAV values are about an order of magnitude
higher than those obtained for the same integration time in the previous,
nonrotating, experiment using these resonators [3]. However, for the purpose
of the isotropy test the relevant integration time was τ = 12 h in the latter
experiment, for which the instability was higher than that at 300 s, relevant
in the present experiment.

1.3.1 Laser power

The dependence of the TEM00 resonance frequencies on the power of the
beam impinging on the resonators could reliably be measured only for rela-
tively large power changes (> 5 µW) and was dependent on the mode-match
eﬃciency. For the resonator with the larger sensitivity, a conservative upper
limit is 50 Hz/µW. For the power levels reaching the cavities and the relative
power instability given above, this implies an inﬂuence of the residual power
ﬂuctuations of not more than 0.5 Hz (1.8 ·10−15).

1.3.2 Tilt of the resonators

The sensitivity of the beat frequency on the orientation of the cryostat was
measured.

The experiment was operated on an optical table that was not ﬂoated but
was supported by a metal frame. The lengths of the feet of the frame could
be changed by acting on screws. Before each run, the tilt sensitivities were
determined by measuring the frequency shift as function of the inclination of
the cryostat in two orthogonal directions. To this end, the leg screws were

1 A precision test of speed of light isotropy

turned and the orientation of the optical table as a whole was changed. The
resulting cryostat inclination was measured by a sensitive two-axis tilt-sensor
attached to the plate that holds the cryostat. The resolution of the tilt sensor
was 0.1 µrad. The tilt sensor output showed a small dependence on the tem-
perature, but this eﬀect was suppressed by a passive temperature insulation.
We measured a sensitivity of about 0.06 Hz/µrad for tilts around two axes
parallel to the resonator axes. Typically, the peak-to-peak tilt variation during
rotation was 80 µrad, corresponding to 5 Hz beat modulation. Because of this
magnitude, the tilt eﬀects were taken into account in the data analysis.

1.3.3 Temperature sensitivities

We measured the dependence of the beat frequency on the temperature of the
optical bench by changing the set-point of the temperature controller. The
temperature was measured using a Cernox sensor (Lakeshore), connected to
the housing of one of the two cavities. Because of the high thermal conduc-
tivity of the bench the temperature diﬀerence between the two resonators is
expected to be very small. The temperature sensitivity was 1.5 Hz/mK. This
is equivalent to a thermal expansion coeﬃcient diﬀerence between the two
cavities of 5.3 · 10−12/K, a value 15 times lower than the nominal expansion
coeﬃcient of sapphire at the same temperature.

The typical residual temperature variation correlated with rotation are
0.15 mK peak-to-peak, leading to an inﬂuence on the beat frequency of 0.2 Hz
(0.8·10−15). The instability of the temperature of the optical bench for various
time scales is shown in Fig. 1.6.

Ambient and cryostat component temperatures did have a signiﬁcant eﬀect

on the beat frequency.

The sensitivity of the beat frequency to changes of the temperature in the
lab was measured by acting on the air conditioning system. A sensitivity of
approx. 75 Hz/K was measured. We did not observe any strong correlation
between the lab temperature and the temperature of the optical bench cold
plate. When the lab temperature was modulated so as to give 40 Hz beat
modulation, the cold plate temperature’s peak-peak amplitude was smaller
than 0.3 mK, corresponding to a calculated beat frequency modulation of less
than 0.5 Hz. Thus, it appears that the observed temperature sensitivity of the
beat frequency was due to the thermal sensitivity of the ﬁbers. Temperature
changes aﬀected their optical path length and in the presence of residual
amplitude modulation and spurious etalons the laser frequency lock point
changed. The ﬁber temperature is inﬂuenced both directly by the ambient
temperature (detectable by heating the ﬁbers locally) and by their contact
to various parts of the cooler inside the cryostat, whose temperatures also
changed with ambient temperature and cooler operating conditions.

Typical temperature variations measured at the top of the cryostat during
one rotation were as low as 25 mK peak-peak after improvements in the
temperature insulation of the setup, corresponding to a 2 Hz peak-to-peak
eﬀect assuming the above temperature sensitivity.

In order to characterize to what extent the various temperature variations
induced beat frequency variations, we analyzed the correlations. The moni-
tored temperatures were two laboratory temperatures measured at the top
and bottom of the cryostat, four temperatures on diﬀerent cooler components
inside the cryostat and the temperature of one resonator holder. A linear
regression analysis showed that there are strong correlations between these
parameters and the beat frequency. Fig. 1.7 shows an example of this analy-
sis. As can be seen, the slow variations of the beat frequency with respect to
a nearly constant drift are to a large extent removed.

A summary of the systematic eﬀects is given in Table 1.1. Not included are
sensitivities to the temperatures of individual refrigerator components, since
they could not be measured.

1.4 Data collection and analysis

A computer-controlled rotation stage rotated the cryostat over a range of
90◦. The total range accessible was limited to a value slightly above this by
the He pressure lines connecting the pulse-tube cooler with the stationary
compressor. The period of rotation was chosen as 600 s. Shorter periods led
to a signiﬁcant shaking of the cryostat and were therefore not used.

Two synchronized computers collected the data. One computer controlled
the rotation angle and rotation speed of the experiment, recorded the beat fre-
quency and the temperature of the optical resonators, by means of a program

written in LabView. Sampling time was 1 s. The second computer recorded
the cryostat tilt angles, and several temperatures as mentioned above. The tilt
and temperature values were used in the data analysis as explained below.

The data discussed here was obtained after about two years of testing and
improvements on the whole system. Test runs performed initially typically ex-
hibited signiﬁcant drifts of properties of the apparatus, such as cooler internal
temperatures. After minimizing these variations, we succeeded in obtaining
stable operation.

For data analysis, the (aliased) beat frequency modulation was removed
from the data by ﬁltering in the Fourier domain, and the sum of the tilt angles
multiplied by the respective tilt sensitivities was subtracted. Decorrelation of
the temperatures was then performed, if desired.

The beat frequency in each interval θ = [0◦; 90◦; 0◦] (labeled by i) was

do not distinguish between angular variations of type cosθ, sinθ and cos2θ, sin2θ,

The obtained amplitude sets {2B(ti)}, {2C(ti)} are then analyzed according
to the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl test theory and the Standard Model Exten-
sion.

1.4.1 Analysis in the RMS framework

It can be shown [8] that according to the RMS test theory, the amplitudes of
the beat frequency modulation with angle are given by

2B(t) = (1/2 − β + δ)(v2/c2

0)(γ3 cos ω⊕T⊕+

(1.3)

2C(t) = (1/2 − β + δ)(v2/c2

0)(γ0 + γ1 cos ω⊕T⊕+

(1.4)

γ2 cos 2ω⊕T⊕ + σ1 sin ω⊕T⊕ + σ2 sin 2ω⊕T⊕),

where the constants are deﬁned in Table 1.2.

T⊕ is the time since the beginning of the data plus an oﬀset that accounts
for a time diﬀerence since the coincidence of the lab’s y axis with the ˆY
axis of the Sun-centered system [5]. The y axis is parallel to one cavity axis
when in the 0◦ position. The direction of the Sun’s velocity v relative to the
cosmic microwave background is given by the right ascension Φ = 168◦ and
the declination Θ = −6◦.

In order to provide an analysis similar to that of [19, 20], we consider a
measurement interval extending over 183 hours that contained 940 rotations
(after removal of a small number of outliers), grouped in 5 sets. Only the
tilt correction was implemented and each set was ﬁtted with the functions
(1.3) and (1.4) plus additional contributions bsyst + b′

that model systematic eﬀects. The individual sets yield the following values
and standard errors for β − δ − 1/2: {(5.5, 5.0), (7.2, 9.0), (−8.3, 3.7), (5.7, 4.5),
(−2.6, 3.9)} · 10−10. The overall result is

where the ﬁrst error is statistical and the second error reﬂects the uncertainty
in the experimentally determined tilt sensitivities and an estimate of the in-
ﬂuence of laser power variations.

1.4.2 SME test theory

Considering that the time span over which data was taken was signiﬁcantly
less than one year, the main goal of the data analysis within the SME model
was the determination of a value for (˜κe−)ZZ . The results of the cryogenic
microwave experiment [4] found the elements of (˜κe−) (except for (˜κe−)ZZ )
and the elements of β⊕(˜κo+) to be at most several parts in 10−15 in magnitude.
If we assume these elements to be zero, we can use the result for 2C only to
determine (˜κe−)ZZ ,

(˜κe−)ZZ =

4h2Ci
3 sin2 χ

.

For the set of rotations under the most stable conditions (of 76 hours duration,
also considered in [8]) the average is h2Cνi = −2.4 Hz with a sample standard
deviation of 1.9 Hz, and h2Bνi = 0.8 Hz, with a sample standard deviation
2.6 Hz. In this analysis, the frequency data was also decorrelated with respect
to the temperature data, whereby data intervals of 10 ks were decorrelated
individually, in order to allow for changing environmental conditions. Without
decorrelation of the temperatures the values are, in the same order, (−3.3 Hz,
2.3 Hz) and (2.8 Hz, 2.4 Hz) [8].

We used the large number of rotations performed under diﬀerent exper-
imental conditions to estimate the uncertainty in 2C due to (identiﬁable)

systematic eﬀects at 1.8 Hz. This includes the errors due to the uncertainty of
the tilt coeﬃcients and due to laser power variations. This results in1

(˜κe−)ZZ = (−2.9 ± 2.2) · 10−14 ,

(1.7)

where the uncertainty is dominated by the systematic eﬀects.

1.5 Conclusions

The experiment described in this work was performed in order to improve
the previous rotating laser experiment by Brillet and Hall, exploiting some
of advances in laser stabilization techniques developed since. Our experiment
yielded a signiﬁcant improvement. Similar to their experiment, a strong limit
for β − δ − 1/2 required exploiting the modulation by Earth’s rotation. At
the same time the present experiment provided an approach to the task of
measuring (˜κe−)ZZ with high accuracy (a weaker limit on this quantity can
also be extracted from the experiment of Brillet and Hall).

Limitations of the experiment were the sensitivity of the optical path
length to temperature, and the limited laser lock quality as a consequence
of the relatively weak cavity throughput. This made the beat frequency more
sensitive to optical path length variations. In addition, a certain level of me-
chanical noise was present. In an upgraded experiment, obvious improvements
are resonators of higher ﬁnesse and throughput, optical path length stabiliza-
tion, and rotations with shorter period and lower tilt modulation.

In discussing a ”null” experiment, it may be argued that a nonzero value
of the measured parameter may have been (partially) canceled by an un-
known systematic eﬀect, so that the bounds provided by an experiment may
be questioned. We emphasize the importance of the fact that three experi-
ments [8, 19, 20] have recently been reported whose results are consistent with
each other. Because they were performed by independent groups with diﬀerent
techniques, it is unlikely that they all exhibit a strong cancellation between
the respective systematics and a substantial nonzero value of (˜κe−)ZZ .

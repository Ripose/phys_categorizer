Does light exert Abraham’s force in a transparent medium? *

S. Antoci and L. Mihich
Dipartimento di Fisica “A. Volta” - Pavia, Italy

Abstract: Abraham’s force seems to have been observed in very low frequency experiments,
but the existence of an Abraham’s force exerted by light is still to be proved. In fact, the only
experiments performed with light have measured the radiation pressure exerted at the interface
between diﬀerent dielectric media, and their value for inferring conclusions about the existence
of Abraham’s force is at best opinable. Twenty years ago Brevik proposed an experiment for
checking what forces light exert in the interior of a transparent medium. It is argued that his
proposal is feasible today with a detection method now at hand, thanks to the great improvements
achieved in manufacturing optical ﬁbres with the required physical properties.

1. - Introduction

Let us ﬁgure out a physicist who has engaged in even a cursory survey of the huge
amount of theoretical literature accumulated in more than one century about the forces
that electromagnetism supposedly produces in dielectric media: he has patiently compared
the divergent outcomes that eminent theoreticians have arrived at; he has doubtfully pon-
dered the relative advantages of the microscopic versus the macroscopic approach; he has
followed the alternating fortunes of electrostriction and magnetostriction 1); he has won-
dered in disbelief why the supposedly universal tool of quantum mechanics has been so
inept, in a time span of seventy years, in shedding some light on this issue. While chal-
lenged by such a confusing state of aﬀairs, he has even been summoned to surrender, and
recognize the evident vanity of the whole eﬀort 2).

No wonder whether this physicist, like the simple Simon of the stinging tale [11]
written by J.L. Synge and entitled “On the present status of the electromagnetic energy
tensor”, might feel that his very perception of an objective reality is at stake, and that, as
an antidote, he had better giving a look to whatever relevant information experimentalists
may have gathered on these forces, in the hope that the latter have turned out to behave
like classical, macroscopic forces usually do, and that they have not been found to depend
on the mental act of splitting the overall energy tensor in two.

1) Accounted for already in the seminal works by Helmholtz [1],[2], they have no place in the
relativistic proposals set forth by Minkowski [3] and Abraham [4], [5], but are present (with a
diﬀerent shape) e.g. in the paper by Einstein and Laub [6].

2) For instance, in Refs. [7]-[10] it is argued, under natural assumptions like those introduced
in Ref. [9], that the way one splits the overall macroscopic energy tensor into a matter term and
a radiation term is just a convention, merely dictated by reasons of convenience, and maybe of
elegance.

2. The experimental evidence for Abraham’s force

Given the huge amount of theoretical literature, our natural philosopher might expect
to be confronted with an equally fair production on the experimental side, but to his
dismay, he will discover that all the papers dealing with experimental ﬁndings can be
easily contained in a small drawer 3).

Clear evidence for the Abraham force 4) was retrieved with two kinds of experiments,
both availing of low frequency electromagnetic ﬁelds [15]-[17]. One experiment performed
by Walker and Lahoz will be summarized here, since it seems [12] to have provided the
most unambiguous outcome up to date.

To do so, let us ﬁrst specialize the expression of Abraham’s generalized force density
given in the Appendix for the case when a global coordinate system exist in which the
components of the metric are:

and the components of the four-velocity of matter are

Let us assume also the vanishing of the four-current si; then eq. (A33) reduces to:

where ǫ and µ stand respectively for the dielectric constant and for the permeability of a
homogeneous and isotropic medium at rest. Greek indices run from 1 to 3 and label the
spatial components, while a comma signals ordinary diﬀerentiation. Then in m.k.s. units
Abraham’s ordinary force density takes the well known expression:

where n is the refractive index of the medium, and c is the velocity of light in vacuo.

In the experiment [16] of Walker and Lahoz a disk of barium titanate, whose relative
dielectric constant was near to 4000, had a small cylindrical hole pierced at its center,
and both the inner and the outer cylindrical surfaces were coated with metallic ﬁlms.
By sending charges on these electrodes a radial electric ﬁeld could be set up within the
disk. The latter was suspended to a tungsten wire, and the torsional pendulum obtained

3) See, e.g., the accurate report [12] published by Brevik in 1979; to our knowledge, just one
further ﬁnding related to our issue, about the angular momentum of radiation in dielectrics [13],
has occurred in the meantime.

4) A simple derivation of Abraham’s energy tensor, found by W. Gordon [14] in 1923, is outlined

in the Appendix.

in this way was subjected to a uniform magnetic ﬁeld of constant value, parallel to the
suspending wire. When the radial electric ﬁeld was allowed to vary according to a sine law
at the resonance frequency of the pendulum, steady oscillations were observed to set in, and
their amplitude was measured with an optical lever. From the known parameters of the
experimental device a value for ~fexp. was inferred, in good agreement with the theoretical
prediction of eq. [4], as far as can be achieved in a delicate experiment of this sort.

3. Reviving a proposal by Brevik

It would be interesting to learn whether light exerts Abraham’s force on a transparent
medium crossed by it. Since in eq. (4) the product ~E
~H is diﬀerentiated with respect
to time, a large value of the instantaneous force density is predicted in this case, but the
direct observation of a mechanical force at the frequency of light is beyond reach also for
present day experimenters. Brevik [18] made some proposals for detecting the Abraham’s
force of light in an indirect way, and one of them will be reconsidered here. An order
of magnitude estimate of several quantities intervening in the experiment is needed for
assessing whether the latter is actually feasible.

∧

Imagine a single-mode optical ﬁbre 5), whose length is L = 1km. The mathematical
description of the eigenmodes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld propagating in such a ﬁbre is
rather involved [21], but if we content ourselves with an order of magnitude evaluation,
the actual ﬁeld for the so called transverse electric mode can be replaced with the ﬁeld of
a plane wave propagating along the axis of the ﬁbre, whose intensity is constant within
the ﬁbre core, and vanishes abruptly at the core radius. Let the axis of the ﬁbre coincide
with the x axis of a Cartesian co-ordinate system, and the electromagnetic plane wave be
a linearly polarized one6) with the nonvanishing components:

5) For light with a wavelength in vacuo λ = 1.3µm, as will be chosen here, a single-mode ﬁbre
is typically constituted by a cylindrical doped glass core with a radius r1 = 5µm, surrounded by
a cylindrical shell of pure silica glass with a slightly lower refractive index of radius r2 = 60µm,
and by a further cylindrical coating made of acrylic resin of still lower refractivity, up to an outer
radius r3 = 125µm. For an account of the way optical ﬁbres behave see e.g. Refs. [19] and [20].
6) Polarization preserving optical ﬁbres are a recent achievement; in usual ﬁbres the polarization
is elliptical with irregular variations of the parameters of the ellipse as one proceeds along the
axis. This circumstance will not aﬀect our order of magnitude estimate.

in an appreciable way the ﬁelds prevailing in the core. The cylinder is suspended to such
a tungsten wire as to constitute a torsion pendulum whose resonance angular frequency ω
is

Due to the low frequency component of Abraham’s force the ﬁrst ﬁbre will exert on the
torsion pendulum the torque8), say:

Eqs. (5) and (6) do not account for losses; this is a reasonable approximation, since the attenuation
of the ﬁbre considered above can be as low as 0.3 dB, the limiting value due to Rayleigh scattering.

forces occurring at the extremities will not contribute to the torque.

We propose availing of the second ﬁbre to detect this velocity. We shall disregard
the fact that the ﬁbre, whose length can be again L = 1km, is wound on a cylinder, and
reason as if it had been uncoiled. We shall assume that when this ﬁbre is at rest its core,
parallel to, say, the x axis, is travelled by the unmodulated, linearly polarized light 9)

We imagine however that the velocity ﬁeld has followed the ﬁbre in the deformation due
to the unwinding action; given the smallness of v, we can approximate the four-velocity of
the uncoiled ﬁbre as:

because k1x is a negligible term also for x = L. Since the ﬁbre is subjected to this velocity
ﬁeld, eqs. (13) and (14) no longer provide an exact solution to the Maxwell’s equations:
the constitutive relation has changed, however slightly, in keeping with eq. (A14). Due to
the smallness of the change, calculating a ﬁrst order perturbation may suﬃce. If δF rs is

in fact, electrostriction [7], [12] in glass should produce a signal that is smaller in magnitude,
and opposite in sign with respect to the one calculated above.

10) Fibre couplers just built with this scope in mind are commonly available. Of course the
whole procedure of detection is only possible if the second ﬁbre is polarization preserving, and if
the coherence length of the light sent in the second ﬁbre is longer than the ﬁbre itself. The latter
condition ultimately means [20] a request about the phase and the amplitude stability of the laser
source that can be met with by present day lasers.

Appendix: Gordon’s derivation of Abraham’s tensor

The general relativistic argument conceived by W. Gordon has been retrieved in the
limbo of the forgotten papers [22]. It runs as follows. In a four-dimensional diﬀerentiable
manifold let us consider a contravariant skew tensor density Hik, a covariant skew tensor
Fik, and write the naturally invariant equations:

Hik

,k = si,

(A1)

F[ik,m] = 0.
The vector density si, deﬁned by the left-hand side of eq. (A1), represents the electric
four-current density, while the comma signals ordinary diﬀerentiation, and we have set
1
F[ik,m] ≡
3 (Fik,m + Fkm,i + Fmi,k). Equations (A1) and (A2) express Maxwell’s equations
in general curvilinear co-ordinates; they need to be complemented with the constitutive
relation of electromagnetism, a tensor equation that uniquely deﬁnes e.g. Hik in terms of
Fik and of whatever additional ﬁelds may be needed for specifying the properties of the
electromagnetic medium. When the assumed dependence of Hik on Fik is algebraic and
linear, the constitutive relation reads:

(A2)

Hik = 1
2

XikmnFmn,

and the electromagnetic properties of the medium are summarized by the four-index tensor
density Xikmn. In the case of vacuum one writes:

the constitutive relation entails only the metric tensor gik and g
known from general relativity. In this case Maxwell’s equations are usually written as:

of the dual to the curl of an “antipotential”:

The derivation of the energy tensor must be performed by keeping into account the homo-
geneous ﬁeld equations obtained above; they dictate that Fik is the curl of a four-vector
ϕi and does not contain the metric.

The constitutive relation for a linear, nondispersive medium will have in general the
form of eq. (A3). Gordon deals with a medium that in addition is homogeneous and
isotropic, when considered at rest; its constitutive relation can be written in a simple
form, due to Minkowski [3], that can be extended without change to general relativity. Let

We shall henceforth enclose in round brackets the indices which are either moved with
γik and γik, or generated by performing a Hamiltonian derivative with respect to the latter
tensors; therefore eq. (A19) will be rewritten as

Due to the strict analogy with the vacuum case made evident in this way, selecting the
form of the Lagrangian density for the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the medium under question
is for Gordon a straightforward matter. He writes:

It is now easy to derive the energy tensor for the electromagnetic ﬁeld by starting

However, T (k)

it is deﬁned with respect to the eﬀective metric γik, not with respect to the true metric
gik, the only one entitled to account for the structure of space-time and, via the Einstein
tensor, for its stress-energy-momentum tensor. In order to ﬁnd the relation between Tik
and T(i)(k) we simply need to express δγik in terms of δgik. From eq. (A10) one obtains
the variation of ui produced by the variation δgmn of the metric:

hence from the deﬁnition (A16) one gets:

the second term at the right-hand side of eq. (A27) by gkq, while the ﬁrst term at the
right-hand side is multiplied by γkq + (ǫµ

In a co-ordinate system for which, at a given event, gik = ηik
u1 = u2 = u3 = 0, u4 = 1, the covariant four-vector within the curly brackets has the
components T(α)(4), 0 (α = 1, 2, 3). But under these circumstances eq. (A27) says that
T(α)(4) = Tα4, hence in a general co-ordinate system one can write:

Equations (A30) and (A32) deﬁne the extension to general relativity of the energy tensor
proposed by Abraham [4], [5] for the electromagnetic ﬁeld if the medium is homogeneous
and isotropic when considered at rest.

The generalized force density due to the electromagnetic ﬁeld is eventually deﬁned by

the covariant divergence:

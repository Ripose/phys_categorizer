Abstract

Here we investigate the practical feasibility of performing soundﬁeld reproduction

throughout a three-dimensional area by controlling the acoustic pressure measured

at the boundary surface of the volume in question. The main aim is to obtain quanti-

tative data showing what performances a practical implementation of this strategy

is likely to yield. In particular, the inﬂuence of two main limitations is studied,

namely the spatial aliasing and the resonance problems occurring at the eigenfre-

quencies associated with the internal Dirichlet problem. The strategy studied is ﬁrst

approached by performing numerical simulations, and then in experiments involv-

ing active noise cancellation inside a sphere in an anechoic environment. The results

show that noise can be eﬃciently cancelled everywhere inside the sphere in a wide

frequency range, in the case of both pure tones and broadband noise, including cases

where the wavelength is similar to the diameter of the sphere. Excellent agreement

was observed between the results of the simulations and the measurements. This

method can be expected to yield similar performances when it is used to reproduce

1 Introduction

During the last few decades, considerable attention has been paid to sound-

ﬁeld reproduction, which raised many issues in acoustics and signal processing.

Several methods can be used to reproduce a given soundﬁeld, the most pop-

ular of which are the binaural techniques [1], Ambisonics [2], and Wave Field

Synthesis [3]. For a given application, the choice of method will depend on

the physical properties of the sound to be reproduced and on the number of

listeners.

We focus here in particular on the reproduction of very low frequency sound-

ﬁelds. One of the practical applications of reproducing soundﬁelds of this kind

is the perceptual assessment of sonic boom sounds. It is particularly diﬃcult

to choose a suitable method of reproducing these soundﬁelds because of their

spectral properties: most of the energy of which sonic boom sounds consist

involves frequencies below a few dozen Hz, and the spectrum is maximum at

only a few Hz [4,5]. Besides, the acoustic pressure level of sonic booms is often

as high as 120 dB.

More generally, reproducing low-frequency soundﬁelds is of interest for the

study of hearing. Perceptual assessments such as those focusing on the incon-

venience associated with transport noise are usually performed using head-

phones. This is the simplest and cheapest method available to deliver a desired

soundﬁeld to the ears of a listener. However, this method is not suitable for

reproducing very low frequencies, which are thought to be perceived not only

by the ears themselves, but by the entire body. The soundﬁelds therefore have

to be extended spatially so that they surround at least the listener’s head and

torso.

Contrary to binaural techniques, Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) and Ambisonics

both give a suitably large reproduction zone surrounding the listener. How-

ever, the main problem on which Ambisonics focuses is not so much to accu-

rately reproduce soundﬁelds, but to give the listener a realistic spatial feeling.

The principle on which the method is based involves several psychoacoustic

hypotheses, which raises problems in the case of infrasonic sounds since the

hearing mechanisms mobilised at these frequencies have not yet been com-

pletely elucidated. Unlike Ambisonics, WFS focuses on reproducing the phys-

ical properties of soundﬁelds in a wide spatial area. Unfortunately, this tech-

nique was originally unable to compensate for the reﬂective properties of the

sound reproduction room, whereas reproducing sonic booms requires using

a small room to reach the pressure levels required at such low frequencies.

Recent studies [6,7] have shown that a preliminary equalization step can be

used to correct the errors induced in WFS by room reﬂections. However the

procedures proposed for this purpose are open-loop ones, which means that

the performances of the system can be aﬀected by any change in the physical

properties of the reproduction room, such as temperature changes.

Several sound reproduction methods have been proposed since the nineties,

3

based on active noise control strategies. Cancelling a primary noise is basically

the same task as reproducing it, since a perfect cancellation of the primary

noise requires generating a secondary noise which has exactly the same prop-

erties, apart from they are in opposition of phase. The main advantage of

methods of this kind is that they can be used to compensate for the reﬂec-

tions generated in the reproduction room by means of adaptive ﬁlters. Some of

these “active control” methods can be compared with local active noise control

strategies [8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. With these methods, either error microphones

are placed directly in the area where the soundﬁeld is to be reproduced, or pre-

liminary measurements are carried out to design control ﬁlters. The presence

of microphones in the reproduction area is not advisable because these condi-

tions may be uncomfortable for the listener. In addition, in order to reproduce

a soundﬁeld in a three dimensional area, a very large number of sensors can be

required. On the other hand, as with WFS, the use of an oﬀ-line ﬁlter design

prevents the performances of the system from remaining constant when the

acoustical properties of the reproduction room ﬂuctuate.

Another category of “active control” soundﬁeld reproduction methods is based

on the application of the Kirchhoﬀ-Helmholtz integral formula [15,16,17,18].

In particular, the Boundary Pressure Control technique (BPC) [16] is based on

the assumption that the acoustic pressure inside a given volume depends only

on the pressure on the boundary surface, excepted at certain frequency values.

Secondary sources generate a soundﬁeld which is measured by microphones

placed on the boundary surface of the volume, and then compared with the

soundﬁeld to be reproduced. BPC can be used to reproduce a given soundﬁeld

over a spatially extended area free of microphones, and enables to accurately

compensate for the room reﬂections using adaptive ﬁltering methods. This

4

approach therefore seems to be appropriate for reproducing low-frequency

soundﬁelds.

In this paper, the results of a feasibility study on the application of BPC

to low-frequency soundﬁeld reproduction are presented. In order to quantify

the performances that can be expected when this strategy is used, applica-

tion of BPC to active noise control in free ﬁeld was tested, both numerically

and experimentally. The reason why this has not been done before is prob-

ably that the implementation of this sound control strategy requires the use

of many sensors and actuators, which have to be managed by one or sev-

eral high-performance multichannel electronic controllers. Although the re-

sults presented in this paper have been obtained in the context of active noise

control, similar performances could probably be obtained in that of soundﬁeld

reproduction, since cancelling a noise and reproducing it constitute basically

the same physical task. Besides, the same hardware and algorithms can be

used in both tasks with very few changes [19].

In the paper, the theory of BPC and its practical limitations are presented

in section 2. Numerical BPC simulations in the time and frequency domains

are presented in section 3. The experimental results obtained after real-time

implementation of BPC are given in section 4. An excellent agreement was

observed between the results of the simulations and of the measurements,

which make possible in the end the statement of practical design rules for

sound reproduction through BPC.

2 Active control of sound using the Boundary Pressure Control

method

2.1 Kirchhoﬀ–Helmholtz equation

The Boundary Pressure Control technique involves the integral representation

of the acoustic ﬁeld. As shown in Fig. 1, let Ω denote a volume in space and Σ

its boundary surface. If there is no acoustic source inside Ω, then the pressure

at any point rΩ in Ω (but not on Σ) can be written as [20]:

p(rΩ) =

G(rΩ, rΣ)

 

ZZΣ

∂p(rΣ)
∂nΣ

− p(rΣ)

∂G(rΩ, rΣ)
∂nΣ

!

drΣ

(1)

where G is the Green’s function in free space, and nΣ the unit vector normal

to the surface. This integral representation of the acoustic pressure, known as

the Kirchhoﬀ–Helmholtz equation, shows that the acoustic pressure measured

inside a volume depends only on the pressure and its normal derivative mea-

sured over the whole surface enclosing the volume. Moreover, for a point rΩ

that lies on the boundary Σ, it can be shown that [20]:

1
2

p(r0

Σ) =

G(r0

Σ, rΣ)

 

ZZΣ

∂p(rΣ)
∂nΣ

− p(rΣ)

∂G(r0

Σ, rΣ)

∂nΣ

!

drΣ

(2)

In addition to Eq. (1), Eq. (2) means that there exists a linear relation between

the pressure and its normal derivative, both measured on Σ. The pressure in-

side Ω therefore depends only on the pressure measured on its boundary sur-

face. The general idea underlying the Boundary Pressure Control technique is

that one needs to impose the appropriate pressure value only over the whole

boundary surface to obtain the required soundﬁeld anywhere inside the vol-

ume. To reproduce of a given soundﬁeld, the method consists in: 1. recording

6

the acoustic pressure over the whole surface of the volume; 2. reproducing the

same pressure values at the points where they were recorded. Another way of

interpreting Eqs. (1) and (2) means that BPC can be used for active noise

control: with these equations, it is only necessary to cancel the acoustic pres-

sure only over the whole boundary surface to cancel it anywhere inside the

volume.

2.2 Practical limitations of BPC

Unfortunately, the use of the BPC technique has two serious limitations. The

ﬁrst one, which is commonly known as spatial aliasing, is due to the spatial

undersampling of the surface controlled. Eqs. (1) and (2) are integral repre-

sentation of the soundﬁeld, which involve summing up the values of the pres-

sure and its normal derivative on a continuous distribution of points over the

whole surface under consideration. In practice, this would involve controlling

the soundﬁeld at an inﬁnite number of points, which is of course impossible.

Actually, in the practical implementation of either a soundﬁeld reproduction

or an active noise control system, it will not be possible to monitor the sound

at more that a few dozen points, and the performances of the system will

therefore decrease when the frequency increases [8,21].

The second physical limitation results from the mathematical properties of

Eq. (2). Assuming that the pressure is equal to zero all over Σ, Eq. (2) becomes

G(r0

∂P (rΣ)
∂nΣ

− P (rΣ)

∂G(r0

Σ, rΣ)

∂nΣ

!

drΣ = 0

 

ZZΣ

(3)

Finding the solutions to Eq. (3) is known as the interior Dirichlet problem.

Eq. (3) has an inﬁnite number of solutions when the frequency is equal to

7

some eigenvalues depending on the shape of the surface [22]. For example, in

the case of a rectangular parallelepiped, the corresponding frequency values

are given by

n
Lz (cid:19)

(cid:18)

where l, m and n are strictly positive integers and Lx, Ly and Lz are the dimen-

sions of the parallelepiped. In the case of a spherical volume, the characteristic

wave numbers correspond to the zeros of the spherical Bessel functions. In par-

(4)

(5)

ticular, the values

fk = k

c
2r

are eigenfrequencies of the problem, where k is a positive integer, r the radius

of the sphere and c the celerity of sound. It is easy to show that Eq. (2) also

has an inﬁnite number of solutions at these frequencies. In practice, this means

that if the acoustic pressure is made to be equal to the appropriate value all

over Σ, it will not necessarily be equal to the appropriate value inside Ω if

the frequency is equal to one of the eigenfrequencies of the interior Dirichlet

problem related to Ω.

In parts 3 and 4, the feasibility of soundﬁeld reproduction using BPC is studied

via simulations and active noise cancellation experiments inside a sphere. The

sphere was chosen because, among the various shapes with the same capacity

V , the sphere is the shape with the lowest surface value. When performing

active noise control inside a volume with capacity V using a BPC strategy, the

sphere therefore gives the best spatial discretization of the boundary surface

with a given number of minimisation microphones. In addition, the sphere is

8

the most regular shape possible: the resonances resulting from the singularity

in the Dirichlet problem are therefore expected to be maximum in this case, so

that they can be easily detected. As far as the authors know, these resonances

have never been studied experimentally in the ﬁeld of active noise control

or sound reproduction, because this requires the use of a suﬃciently large

number of transducers, depending on the shape of the volume in which the

control is to be carried out. Preliminary simulations showed that in the case

of a sphere, about 16 microphones are required, whereas in the case of a cube,

at least 50 microphones are required, which is a heavy constraint for active

noise control implementations.

2.3 From active noise control to soundﬁeld reproduction

Let us consider an active noise control setup, including a number of primary

sources, secondary sources and minimisation microphones. In the frequency

domain, each acoustic path between a source and a microphone is entirely

described by a complex scalar. If G denotes the matrix of the acoustic paths

between the secondary sources and the minimisation microphones, and p0 the

vector of the primary pressures measured at the microphones, then the vector

of optimal command signals for noise cancellation with the secondary sources,

regardless of any causality or feasibility constraint, is given by:

u = −G−1p0

(6)

If Tikhonov regularization [23] is introduced into the matrix inversion pro-

cess, which corresponds to adding an eﬀort weighting to the command vector

9

computation [24], Eq. (6) becomes

u = −(GHG + βI)

−1

GHp0

(7)

(8)

(9)

where β is the regularization coeﬃcient. Such a coeﬃcient usually helps in

widening the minimisation area around the microphones because with regu-

larization the noise minimisation problem at a ﬁnite number of microphones

ﬁts better the underlying global minimisation problem at an inﬁnite number

of locations. Therefore, if H denotes the matrix of acoustic paths between

the secondary sources and some observation points, the total pressure ptot

measured at these points when the control is on is given by the formula

ptot = ppri + psec
= ppri + Hu
= ppri − H(GHG + βI)

−1

GHp0

where ppri is the vector of pressures when the control is oﬀ, and psec denotes

the vector of secondary pressures, both measured at the observation points.

The mean attenuation obtained on N observation points (x1, x2, ... xN) can

then be written:

A =

20log10

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

Let us now consider the case where the same arrangement of sources and

microphones is used for soundﬁeld reproduction purposes. The task now con-

sists in generating a soundﬁeld with the secondary sources which is as similar

as possible to the primary soundﬁeld at the minimisation microphones. The

vector of optimal command signals with regularization is given here by:

u′ = (GHG + βI)

−1

GHp0

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

Hence, the vector of the reproduced pressures, which is also the vector of the

secondary pressures measured at the observation points, is given by:

= −u

p′
sec = −psec

Whereas the attenuation is the most appropriate criterion for assessing the

noise control performances, the quality of the reproduction can be measured

in terms of relative error:

E =

The reconstruction error is therefore the opposite of the attenuation obtained

in the case of active noise cancellation. In other words, if the active noise

control setup attenuates a given noise of 40 dB, it will be able to reproduce

the primary soundﬁeld pressure with a relative error of −40 dB, e.g. 1 %.

Assuming that the acoustic paths are the same in both cases, the optimum

active noise control and soundﬁeld reproduction performances will be similar

in the frequency domain, which is quite natural, since in both cases, the per-

formances depend only on the inversion of the matrix of secondary acoustic

paths. For the same reasons, the performances of noise cancellation and re-

11

production will also be similar using adaptive algorithms in the time domain.

It is therefore possible to assess the performances of a soundﬁeld reproduction

setup using it as an active noise control setup, and vice-versa.

3 Numerical simulations

3.1 The setup used in simulations

In this section, the results of preliminary numerical simulations performed in

the case of the 30 × 30 multi-channel active noise control of a spherical volume

are presented. It was proposed here to simulate the behaviour of an active

noise control setup in order to compare the results with those obtained ex-

perimentally (part 4). However, it is worth noting that the results would be

exactly the same if the setup simulated was a soundﬁeld reproduction system,

as shown in section 2.3. Firstly, the system was simulated in the frequency do-

main in order to determine the optimum predictable attenuation. The results

obtained were most encouraging, although the two limitations mentioned in

part 2 dramatically restricted the noise cancellation performances inside the

volume. Secondly, the system was simulated in the time domain in order to

assess the performances of a real system involving a Filtered-X Least Mean

Square (FXLMS) time-domain algorithm. Two types of primary ﬁelds were

tested: pure tones, and broadband noises. The results were predictably less

satisfactory here than in the frequency-domain case, because it was diﬃcult

to make the algorithm converge. An interesting ﬁnding which emerged was

the fact that the problem of Dirichlet resonances is a serious weakness of the

system even in the case of a broadband primary soundﬁeld.

12

Figs. 2 and 3 show the setup used in the numerical simulations. It was com-

posed of one virtual primary source, 30 virtual secondary sources, and 30

minimisation microphones. As shown in Fig. 2, the virtual microphones were

distributed on the surface of a sphere with a diameter of 30 cm, along 8 arcs

of a circle, as far from each other as possible. The positions of the secondary

sources were the homothetical images of the microphone positions on a sphere

with a radius of 60 cm radius. The primary source was located on the same

horizontal plane as the center of the sphere, 4 m away from it. In the compu-

tations, all the transducers were assumed to be perfect monopoles in free ﬁeld:

therefore, the impulse responses of each source measured at each microphone

were perfect impulses with a time-delay of r

c seconds, attenuated by a factor

r, where r denotes the distance between the transducers.

3.2 Frequency-domain simulations

Frequency-domain simulations were carried out using the optimal control for-

mulation given in section 2.3. Fig. 4 shows the average attenuation obtained

with a mesh consisting of 160 points regularly spaced inside the sphere as

a function of the frequency, without any regularisation procedure (β = 0 in

Eq. 7). This ﬁgure illustrates the two physical limitations mentioned in part 2.

In a ﬁrst approximation, it can be seen that the average attenuation decreased

linearly from 0 to 1000 Hz, by approximately 6 dB per Hz. This regular de-

crease in the control performances was due to the spatial undersampling: the

higher the frequency, the less satisfactory the discretization of the soundﬁeld

over the boundary surface and the control performance became. In addition,

the control performances dropped dramatically when the frequency of the

13

primary soundﬁeld approached the eigenfrequencies of the interior Dirichlet

problem. The attenuation even fell to less than −30 dB, which means that

the interior pressure level present when the control was on was more than ten

times that occurring when control was oﬀ. This was because only the acoustic

pressure was controlled, although both the pressure and its normal deriva-

tive should be controlled: the sound pressure can have any value inside the

sphere, even if the control is highly eﬃcient at the level of the minimisation

microphones.

Fig. 5 shows the results obtained in the case where β was taken to be equal

to 0.9. It shows that it is possible to prevent the pressure attenuation from

being negative at the eigenfrequencies of the Dirichlet problem by regularizing

the matrix before it is inverted. This improvement is achieved with no great

loss in the control performances inside the sphere, as shown in Fig. 6. Another

advantage of the regularization procedure is that it decreases the amplitude

of the command vector. This suggests that in the time domain, it might be

useful to add a leakage term to the control algorithm [24], which is similar

to performing Tikhonov regularization in the frequency domain and can use-

fully increase the stability of an active noise control system of this kind. Note

that in the case of a regularized matrix inversion process, the attenuation ob-

served inside the sphere can be greater than that observed at the minimisation

microphones.

3.3 Time-domain simulations

In the time domain, the acoustic paths between each source and each micro-

phone are described by impulse responses. In the case of perfect point sources

14

under free-ﬁeld conditions, the impulse responses are time-delayed, attenuated

pulses. However, since the time delays are mostly not exact numbers of sam-

pling periods, the impulse responses need to be approximated for discrete-time

simulation purposes. The accuracy of the approximation depends strongly on

the sampling frequency. In this study the frequency chosen was 8192 Hz, which

has been found to suﬃce in view of the dimensions of the setup: the shortest

distance between two transducers was 30 cm, which corresponds to a delay of

approximately 7 samples at this frequency. The transfer functions were ﬁrst

computed in the frequency domain in 8192 frequency bins, and they were

then converted into impulse responses by performing an Inverse Fast Fourier

Transform (IFFT) and truncated to their ﬁrst 256 coeﬃcients. The impulse

responses obtained were ﬁnally used in a program simulating a multichannel

FXLMS algorithm in the time domain. The same formulation as in [24] was

used to adapt the ﬁlter coeﬃcients:

w(n + 1) = w(n) − α

ˆRT(n)e(n) + β′w(n)
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(14)

where w(n) denotes the vector of the minimisation ﬁlter coeﬃcients at the

nth sample time, ˆR(n) denotes the matrix of the estimated ﬁltered reference

signals, e(n) denotes the vector of the error signals, α denotes the convergence

coeﬃcient, and β′ is a regularization coeﬃcient. Note that the primary source

command signal was used as the reference signal by the FXLMS algorithm.

Two types of simulation were carried out, corresponding to two types of pri-

mary signals: ﬁrstly, a pure tone signal at various frequencies; and secondly, a

broadband signal with a frequency range of 0–900 Hz.

In the case of pure tone primary signals, the frequency was increased step by

step: at each frequency value, the algorithm was let to converge during a few

15

thousand samples, and the value of the attenuation was then averaged based on

the last thousand samples and saved. Note that the α convergence coeﬃcient

was the same at each frequency value. As in the experimental case, the length

of the estimated secondary paths was 200 coeﬃcients and the length of the

minimisation ﬁlters was 10 coeﬃcients. Fig. 7 shows the pressure attenuation

obtained with pure tone primary signals from 200 to 1000 Hz at the minimi-

sation microphones, compared to the averaged pressure attenuation inside the

sphere. The results obtained here were very similar to those obtained in the

frequency domain in the regularized case throughout the frequency band, but

the control was less eﬃcient in the time domain. The attenuation is not shown

here at frequencies inferior to 200 Hz, because the algorithm had diﬃculty in

converging at lower frequencies, and the computation time required for the

algorithm to converge with a smaller value of the α coeﬃcient would have

been too long. This convergence problem results from the ill-conditioning of

the matrix of secondary paths at low frequencies [21], which again conﬁrms

the importance of using leakage in systems of this kind.

In the case of a broadband primary signal, the length of the minimisation

ﬁlters and estimated secondary paths were both set at 90 coeﬃcients. The al-

gorithm was made to converge during several dozen thousands of samples, and

the minimisation ﬁlters obtained were then used to compute in the frequency

domain the pressure attenuation occurring inside the sphere and at the min-

imisation microphones. Fig. 8 shows the control performances obtained using

this method with leakage in the case of a 0–900 Hz white primary noise. Sim-

ilar ﬁndings to those made in the case of pure tone signals can be obtained

here: although the control performances observed at the minimisation micro-

phones are good throughout the frequency range of the primary signal, the

16

average pressure attenuation obtained inside the volume becomes poor at fre-

quencies approaching the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet problem. Note that for

frequencies below 500 Hz, the performances obtained inside the sphere were

more satisfactory than those obtained at the minimisation microphones.

3.4 Conclusions

Several important conclusions can be drawn from this preliminary study. First,

all the simulations presented here showed how eﬃciently the system controls

low-frequency noise. The control performances were satisfactory throughout

the volume at frequencies below 500 Hz in all the cases tested. At this fre-

quency, the wavelength is 68 cm, which is approximately equal to the diame-

ter of the sphere: the control is therefore no longer local and actually includes

the whole volume. Secondly, the inaccuracy of the spatial sampling and the

non-uniqueness of the interior Dirichlet problem seem to be two important

limitations of this control method, including for control of broadband noises.

Thirdly, leakage appears to be a useful means of reducing the resonance prob-

lems which occur when the frequency tends to the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet

problem.

4 Experiments

4.1 Experimental setup

Although the aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of sound-

ﬁeld reproduction using BPC, we decided to assess the setup performances

17

by performing active noise control experiments using the same strategy. The

controllers used here had already been programmed with an active noise con-

trol algorithm, and the behaviour of the setup was expected to be similar in

the case of both active noise cancellation soundﬁeld reproduction, as shown

in part 2.3.

The setup used in these experiments is shown in Fig. 9. Thirty minimisa-

tion microphones were distributed over the whole surface of a sphere with

a diameter of 60 cm, as in the case of the setup modelled in the numerical

simulations. The primary soundﬁeld was emitted by a primary loudspeaker

placed at a few meters from the microphone sphere, and was controlled by

thirty secondary sources distributed over the surface of a sphere with a di-

ameter of 170 cm, so that the distance between each secondary source and

the nearest minimisation microphone was approximately 30 cm. Secondary

sources and minimisation microphones were numbered so that microphone 1

was the nearest microphone to source 1, and so on. In addition to the minimi-

sation microphones, two other microphones were placed inside the microphone

sphere in order to measure the control performances inside the sphere: one was

in the center, and the other one was approximately mid-way between the cen-

ter of the sphere and its surface. As in the numerical simulations, the control

performances were measured in the case of two types of primary noises: pure

tone noise, and broadband noise.

In the case of the pure tone noise, the secondary source command signals were

computed by a 32 × 32 multichannel controller designed for active control

of tonal disturbances. The secondary paths identiﬁed were saved into FIR

ﬁlters with 200 coeﬃcients and the length of the minimisation FIR ﬁlters was

arbitrarily chosen as 10 coeﬃcients, although 2 coeﬃcient may have suﬃced

18

in theory. The frequency of the primary sound was increased by 5 Hz every

16 s from 200 to 700 Hz: the algorithm was let to converge during the ﬁrst 8 s

and the acoustic pressure was measured during the last 8 s. The convergence

coeﬃcient α remained constant throughout the measurement process. In both

the measurement process and the control process, the sampling frequency was

2048 Hz.

In the case of broadband noise, however, secondary source command signals

were computed by two 16 × 16 multichannel LMA COMPARS controllers [25]

programmed with an FXLMS algorithm, as shown in Figs. 10 and 11. The in-

puts to the ﬁrst COMPARS were the pressure signals from microphones 1–16,

and the outputs were the secondary sources 1–16 command signals; the sec-

ond COMPARS received the signals from microphones 17–30, and computed

the commands to be transmitted to sources 17–30. Note that the microphones

and sources were spatially distributed in two blocks in order to ensure the

simultaneous convergence of the both algorithms. The whole active noise con-

trol setup, including the two controllers, can be viewed in fact as a single

FXLMS system with a block-diagonal matrix of identiﬁed secondary paths: a

suﬃcient condition for this system to converge is that the matrix of real sec-

ondary paths is block-diagonal dominant [26]. Note also that the experiment

was conducted in a quasi-anechoic environment to facilitate the convergence

of the algorithms. If the system had been implemented in a more reverberant

room, the reﬂections from the walls would have increased the eﬀects of each

secondary source on the distant minimisation microphones, and the transfer

matrix would have been less diagonally dominant. Lastly, the electric signal

fed to the primary source was used by both controllers as a reference signal for

the FXLMS algorithm. The identiﬁed secondary paths and the control ﬁlters

19

both consisted of FIR ﬁlters with 90 coeﬃcients. As in the pure tone case, a

sampling frequency of 2048 Hz was used. The primary noise was therefore a

white noise with a 0 to 1024 Hz spectrum. The convergence coeﬃcient (α in

Eq. 14) was taken to be approximately half of the value at which the algorithm

began to diverge and was the same in the two controllers.

4.2 Results in the pure tone case

Fig. 12 shows the attenuation measured at the minimisation and observation

microphones in the case of pure tone primary signals with frequency ranging

from 100 to 700 Hz. In the 200–500 Hz frequency band, the attenuation values

measured both on the surface of the sphere and inside it were greater than

30 dB, which corresponds to a highly eﬃcient control in the whole volume.

Beyond 500 Hz, however, the attenuation dropped oﬀ dramatically at the ob-

servation microphones, reaching a minimum value of only a few dB at 580 Hz,

although it was still above 30 dB at the minimisation microphones. Note that

the minimum attenuation was obtained when the frequency ranged between

580 and 590 Hz, which is slightly above the value of 566 Hz expected for a

sphere with a radius of 30 cm. However, this amount of frequency shift was

more or less expected, because the measured eigenfrequency corresponds to

a radius of 29 cm and 1 cm was approximately the accuracy of the minimi-

sation microphone localization. Note also that the attenuation decreased at

frequencies below 200 Hz. This was due to two factors: ﬁrst, the secondary

sources used for the noise control were small, and therefore not very power-

ful at low frequencies; second, the convergence of the algorithm was slow in

this frequency range, probably because of the ill-conditioning of the matrix of

20

secondary paths. One interesting result emerged when the attenuation curves

of the two interior microphones were compared: the attenuation measured

at microphone 1 when the frequency was close to the ﬁrst eigenfrequency of

the sphere is lower than that measured at microphone 2. This ﬁnding can

be explained by the fact that the ﬁrst eigenmode of the sphere is radial, the

maximum pressure value being reached in the center of the sphere, where

microphone 1 was located.

Good agreement was found to exist here between the experimental data and

the results of the simulations, as shown in Fig. 13. The value of the sphere ra-

dius was set at 29 cm in the simulation, in order to take into account the shift

of the ﬁrst eigenfrequency observed experimentally: this corresponds to the

ﬁrst eigenfrequency occurring at approximately 585 Hz. It can be seen from

Fig. 13 that even if the assumptions made in the numerical simulations (point

sources in free ﬁeld) are not met in the experiment, the computations give a

very good idea of what occurs in practice. On the one hand, the frequency-

domain simulations of optimal control give an approximation of the maximum

attenuation values reached in the experiments. On the other hand, the values

obtained in the time-domain simulations were very similar to those measured

in practice, including the diﬀerences in the attenuation between the two in-

terior microphones. Note that the minimum attenuation value was obtained

at interior microphone 1, which was placed in the center of the sphere, under

both real and simulated conditions.

21

4.3 Results in the broadband case

Fig. 14 shows the amplitude of the frequency response measured between the

primary source command signal and the minimisation microphones in the

case of a 0–1024 Hz broadband primary sound, with and without control. As

was to be expected the control performances were less satisfactory here than

with pure tone signals. However, the control was found to be highly eﬃcient,

since the attenuation achieved was above 15 dB in almost the whole frequency

range under consideration. Note that the poor control performances measured

at frequencies around 150 Hz are due to the insuﬃcient electrical insulation

between the components of the experimental setup and the power supply.

The control performances obtained inside the sphere are given in Fig. 15. As

in the case of pure tone signals, the pressure attenuation achieved inside the

sphere was greater than the attenuation at the surface at frequencies below

500 Hz. Below this frequency, the setup is therefore able to eﬃciently cancel

a random noise anywhere in the sphere. Above this frequency, however, the

attenuation decreases inside the sphere, reaching a minimum value of around

0 dB at a frequency of 585 Hz. Note that with interior microphone 1, which

is in the center of the sphere, the attenuation is even negative between 570

and 600 Hz. The pressure measured at the interior microphone 1 when the

control is on is therefore greater than the pressure measured when the control

is oﬀ at these frequency values. Note also that the magnitude of the resonance

occurring at around 585 Hz at microphone 1 is greater than at microphone 2.

This conﬁrms that the resonance induced at this frequency corresponds to a

radial eigenmode, which reaches a maximum value in the center of the sphere.

22

In Fig. 16, the experimental results are compared with those of the simu-

lations. It can be seen that the simulation does not model the experimental

setup behaviour above 600 Hz. However, the agreement between the measured

attenuation and the numerically computed values is very good below this fre-

quency. The simulated attenuation values calculated at both the minimisation

microphones and the interior microphones are very similar to those obtained

in practice. Besides, as in the pure tone case, the diﬀerences in noise attenu-

ation at the interior microphones are well reproduced, including the fact that

around 585 Hz the attenuation reaches a minimum in the center of the sphere.

4.4 Conclusions: interpretation in terms of soundﬁeld reproduction

The experimental results obtained with the present active noise control setup

can be interpreted in terms of soundﬁeld reproduction, as described in part

2.3. These results show that an attenuation amounting to more than 30 dB

was obtained in the pure tone signals at frequencies below 500 Hz. The setup

is therefore able to reproduce pure tone soundﬁelds in the same frequency

range with an error of less than 3 %, which is very accurate. In the case

of broadband noise, the results show that the reconstruction error can reach

about 10 % (−20 dB) in the 100 − 500 Hz frequency range. These results are

most encouraging and show that BPC has considerable potential for use as a

low-frequency soundﬁeld reproduction strategy.

However, the negative attenuation observed when Dirichlet resonance occurred

suggests the presence of a reconstruction error grater than 100 %, which means

that a reproduction system based on the use of BPC would be completely un-

able to reproduce soundﬁelds at the eigenfrequencies of the internal Dirichlet

23

problem.

5 General conclusions and perspectives

In this study, it was established that an active noise control setup based on the

Boundary Pressure Control technique can eﬃciently cancel noise everywhere

inside a volume. The existence of considerable similarities between active noise

control and soundﬁeld reproduction suggests that similar performances can be

obtained when BPC is used to reproduce soundﬁelds. However, the results of

both simulations and experimental measurements show that spatial aliasing

and the non-uniqueness of the solution to the interior Dirichlet problem limit

the use of this strategy. In particular, resonance processes occurring inside the

volume when the frequency approaches the eigenfrequencies of the Dirichlet

problem completely prevent the system from cancelling the primary noise at

these frequencies. It was observed that in practice the attenuation can even

become negative when these resonances occur. In the case of soundﬁeld repro-

duction applications, this means that the reconstruction error could be greater

than 100 % at these frequencies. Besides, the data obtained here show that

the problem occurs in the case of both pure tone signals and broadband noise

signals. Thus, ﬁnding a means of reducing the drop in the performances result-

ing from this problem without increasing the number of transducers required

would be an interesting goal for future studies. Some solutions have already

been proposed in [16] and [15], such as adding a minimisation microphone

inside the volume under consideration, but these solutions have not yet been

tested in practice, nor in 3D numerical simulations.

This study was carried out in an almost anechoic environment, in order to sim-

24

plify the impulse responses which had to be compensated by the controller.

However, in order to reach high pressure levels at very low frequencies required

by a realistic reproduction of sonic booms, the reproduction system has to be

implemented in a room, and the reﬂections occurring under these conditions

cannot be neglected. Longer minimisation ﬁlters will probably be required

to achieve comparable performances in a room, as the impulse responses of

the secondary sources will be longer under these conditions than in a quasi-

anechoic environment. The numerical simulation of an in-room soundﬁeld re-

production system has been previously carried out [27] and the results suggest

systems of this kind can accurately reconstruct low-frequency wavefronts. The

authors therefore intend in the future to implement low-frequency soundﬁeld

reproduction strategies using BPC in a specially designed reproduction room.

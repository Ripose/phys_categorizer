Interferometric gravitational wave detectors are devoted to pick up the eﬀect induced on masses
by gravitational waves. The variations of the length dividing two mirrors is measured through a
laser interferometric technique. The Brownian motion of the masses related to the interferometer
room temperature is a limit to the observation of astrophysical signals. It is referred to as thermal
noise and it aﬀects the sensitivity of both the projected and the future generation interferometers.
In this paper we investigate the relevance of small non-linear eﬀects and point out their impact on
the sensitivity curve of interferometric gravitational wave detectors (e.g. VIRGO, LIGO, GEO. . . )
through perturbative methods and numerical simulations.

We ﬁnd that in the ﬁrst order approximation the constants characterizing the power spectrum

density (PSD) are renormalized but it retains its typical shape.

This is due to the fact that the involved Feynman diagrams are of tadpole type.
Higher order approximations are required to give rise to up-conversion eﬀects.
This result is predicted by the perturbative approach and is in agreement with the numerical re-
sults obtained by studying the system’s non-linear response by numerically simulating its dynamics.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is known that every correlation function of a stationary stochastic process may be fully obtained as the functional

derivative of the associated generator.

This one has to obey some equations connected to the equations of motion which govern the dynamics of the
system. If we consider a stochastic system and apply to it all the mathematical techniques and strategies, which
have been currently set up for studying a particle physics problem, then we get some new ways of approching the
Fokker-Planck equation connected to a random process, both through perturbative methods and non perturbative
ones. This requires a procedure of quantization starting from a classical Lagrangian associated to the theory itself
and a passage to the Euclidean metrics.

The probability of shifting from one place to another in the case of a Brownian motion is expected to obey an

evolution equation, like a propagator of Feynman 1.

In accordance with that analogy the equation of Fokker-Planck is equivalent to a Schr¨odinger equation in Euclidean

It has been shown in the
literature that approximate solutions may be yielded by expanding order by order the above equations if the leading

for the noise’s amplitude and if it tends to zero we recover the classical macroscopic equations without ﬂuctuations.
It is the same situation as in quantum mechanics where the uncertainty is related to the constant ¯h. Exploiting this

Starting from the lowest order approximation one may solve the Schwinger-Dyson equations above with an iterative

to recover from W (J, K) the connected correlation functions. On the other hand it may be expected that the same

II. MATHEMATICAL FORMALISM

A physical system is usually represented by many deegres of freedom with their characteristic evolution times.
Those variables that evolve very rapidly may be integrated over and their contribution is averaged over long time
periods. What we are interested in is the resulting evolution of the system. The inﬂuence of the microscopic deegres
of freedom on the macroscopic ones may be expressed as a term of interaction [5,6].

The characteristic times of such interaction are very short in comparison with the characteristic times of the slowly
evolving deegres of freedom and the two time scales may be treated separately, at the expense of including a stochastic
term in the equation of motion written for the macroscopic variables. Such term must be interpreted as follows. At
any time there are so many interactions that we may only treat them by their statistical properties and consider the
eﬀect on the macroscopic system as little ﬂuctuations over the deterministic motion.

Another eﬀect is that phenomenological constants appearing in the equation of motion are related to the interactions

with the microscopic deegres of freedom.

So it is only a matter of convenience separating deterministic from stochastic contributions in the equation [7,8].
As an example we treat a classical harmonic oscillator subjected to stochastic forces. It is convenient to use the
notation of the Langevin equation that is a common equation of motion with a random contribution. The friction

with KBT we do not use yet.
The evolution equation is

0, m is the mass and D is the diﬀusion constant whose relation

Since we are interested in stationary properties t ad t′ are very large. If this were not true the initial conditions should
be taken into account. Even if we preserve the terms containing Φ′(0) they all vanish for large times. An intuitive
idea may be drawn by considering the two components in (2).

The term in Φ′(0) doesn’t correlate with anything. When we take an average using the properties (3) the terms in

Φ′(0) are simply a factor.

When times increase they tend faster to zero than possible averaged terms they are multiplied for. The correlation

When we have a connection of several oscillators the procedure stated above is the simplest one because of the
dimensionality of Γ. For now it may seem a tortuous mathematical way.

A. Generating Functionals

It may be shown that the results of the preceding subsection coincide with the treatment in the introduction.

if the reference system is chosen in such a way that Φi(t0) = 0. Otherwise it appears a term linear in J that takes
the initial conditions into account.

Hence we have constructed a solution for the connected correlations’ generator.

Now suppose that the response of the oscillator is not perfectly linear. We may write the diﬀerential equation

B. Non-linear Corrections

0q(t) + ǫq3(t) = F (t)

to describe such a situation. The parameter ǫ is assumed so small that the system’s behaviour can be described by
a perturbative approach. On a formal level we are searching for the eigenvectors of the evolution operator that have
the property of being non-interacting eigenstates of the system. Because of the perturbative term in the equation of
motion, some new cross-terms appear in the evolution operator whose representative matrix is no more diagonal, but
for the description of the system the basis of imperturbed eigenvectors is still valid [9,10].

These relations require no knowledge of t and t′ but only of t

t′. If t and t′ were not very large this property
should no longer be true. Throughout we use inﬁnitely large values for times, to calculate correlation functions in
equilibrium conditions. In the stationary limit we may write the power spectrum density (PSD) as follows

tionary solutions of the Langevin equation when non-linear terms appear. These terms are related to non-quadratic
contributions in the Lagrangian function [14].

This means that in the equilibrium state the proper frequency changes with the local form of the potential function.
Consequently the parameters governing the responsive behaviour of the system appear modiﬁed. As outlined above the

in the ﬁrst order approximation. Finally the relation D = 2mξω0KBT is a thermodynamic property which we expect
by the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem [11].

Wherever there is damping there must be ﬂuctuations. They are small because of the factor KBT . Such a
size is known beforehand because the ﬂuctuations are related to ordinary equilibrium statistical mechanics. From a
macroscopic point of view the ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem tells us that the equilibrium is a sort of balance between
two opposing tendencies (the noise and the damping) and that the ﬂuctuations are determined by the temperature.
This fact is expressed by the identity D = 2mξω0KBT for the macroscopic parameters. F (t) is treated as an external
force whose stochastic properties are given by both the constants 2mξω0 and T and it acts regardless of q. Even
if F (t) is irregular and unpredictable we may fully express its properties in terms of the postulated autocorrelation
function. Then the diﬀerential equation

is well-deﬁned with a well-deﬁned solution. Its characteristic Green function is obtained from inserting

III. NON-LINEAR EFFECTS

After the preliminaries of the previous section we transfer our attention to a single pendulum and moreover we use
the second order approximation to estimate the corrections related to a non-linear term in the motion equation. Thus
if we use same notations and techniques as before, we ﬁnd the power spectrum density

We are less interested in static properties than in dynamic properties, so turn our attention to the power spectrum

density. We may apply the previous analytic estimations to a simple pendulum having length l
m

∼
Indeed even in a multi stage pendulum holding the mirrors of an interferometer, the thermal noise depends on
the last pendulum and on the test mass itself, and above the pendulum proper frequency the dynamics mimics the
response of a free mass. In order to have an idea of the noise if some non-linearity arises we use a value for m staying
between a single test mass and all the tilting ﬁlters in the VIRGO superattenuator [13].

∼

Accordingly to the antennas’ pendula requirements that are being built, we take l as the coarse order of magnitude

for the length of the system’s suspension.

This argument inspired the choice of the mechanical quality factor’s value too.
In Fig.1 the PSD is shown. It gives the analysed system’s behaviour.
Because of the non-linear contributions, there are two corrections particularly peaked in correspondence of 2πf

Another consequence of non-linearity is related to the bins correlation and we develop it in this section. Owing to

IV. DIAGRAMS REPRESENTATION

As a companion to a perturbative calculation of the solution of the stochastic diﬀerential equation, it is sometimes

advantageous to consider the alternative method of stochastic diagrams.

The solution of the linear diﬀerential equation is associated with a line and a cross denoting the Green’s function
and the stochastic force respectively. If the non-linear contribution is taken into account we may iteratively solve the
stochastic diﬀerential equation. The non-linear term contributes a vertex that represents the convolution product of
the imperturbed Green’s function and the solutions of the equation.
This procedure is better illustrated by the ﬁrst diagrams in Fig.4.
The notation is meant to indicate the following. From the diﬀerential equation we may write the solution as an
iterative expansion. Accordingly q(t) depends on various products of noise terms which we average over to obtain
correlation functions. When there are several equivalent possible ways of combining crosses a combinatorical factor
arises.

The ﬁrst order correction to the two-point correlation function is the result of two tadpole-type diagrams. Their

contribution is a correction to ω0.

In the second order approximation there are tadpole-type contributions as well.
Yet there are two-loops diagrams that introduce new terms with diﬀerent poles than the previous corrections.
Now observe the diagrams in Fig.5. The ﬁrst three ones contribute a second order correction to ω0. The other two
entail new terms which are peaked near the resonance frequency and three times the resonance frequency. If ξ is large
the former peak may not be distinguished from the principal one.

The latter is evident.

In order to understand those modiﬁcations we may note that there are stronger forces pulling the system back to the
equilibrium conﬁguration and the result is that the measured recall constant mω2

0 has a new greater value.

For linear systems in contact with a heat-bath it seems that the damping force have been expressly designed to

constrain every motion below the thermal noise.

proper frequencies damping times are longer.

This will be true even in the non-linear case but due to the system’s dynamics and the appearance of up-converted

This eﬀect participates to the attenuation of the system’s response below the fundamental frequency as it is shown
in Fig.7. The coupling constant assumes non-perturbative values and the numerical results conﬁrm the tendency of
the perturbative case.

In this section we are planning a numerical simulation to analyse the equation

the probability that a certain initial conﬁguration has evolved into another one because of a stochastic force whose
statistical properties are known.

We may also recover the distribution of every physical quantities depending on q and p. At every time the

corresponding operator may be expressed by means of the Heisenberg picture

VI. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS

In the following we shall use the same ξ and ω0 previously adopted.
These are the only two important physical parameters because of the scaling we introduced at the end of the
previous section. The form we recovered for S(f ) is to be multiplied by the scaling factor KB T
. It is convenient to
mω2
0
recall that we wrote it as the spectrum at the zero order with a term in the denominator standing for the “self-energy”.
It gives a correction to the physical parameters.

Furthemore there is a brand new resonance appearing as an up-conversion of the original single resonant frequency.
In Fig.6 the power spectrum density for α = 0.1 is shown. There is a little peak at three times the resonance

frequency as previously expected.

The results obtained from the numerical simulation are compared with the curve referred to α = 0.0. It may be
noted that S(f ) is reduced for low values of f and that the fundamental peak moves a little forward. Indeed we
expected this from the perturbative variations of mω2

0 and 2mξω0.
The up-converted resonance is set in a frequency region corresponding to small values of S(f ). This is due to the

ǫ
(mω2

response of the system that behaves like a ﬁlter attenuating those components whose frequency is greater than ω0.

For smaller values of α the up-conversion eﬀect is not appreciable. Let us discuss if α = 2KB T ǫ

0)2 << 1. Actually
0)2 is generally tremendously smaller than the parameter (2KBT )−1. The conclusion is that the
the quotient
coupling constant between non-linearities in the suspension system’s behaviour and thermal noise is so small that
an enhancement of up-conversion eﬀects is not realistic. This is due to the smallness of thermal ﬂuctuations and
to the fact that there are not contributions proportional to the coupling constant, because only tad-poles diagrams
contribute at the ﬁrst order approximation. These diagrams contribute a parameters’ correction but do not modify
the correlations at diﬀerent times.

(mω2

We expect that the resonant frequency should be greater if α goes up.

It happens if the system explores the
non-linear zone of the phase space. When T rises the greater amplitude of ﬂuctuations just produce such an eﬀect. If
the recall constant increases it is obvious that the opposite tendency is obtained.

Finally we note that formally there are two more peaks than in the linear case, but one of these can not be
distinguished from the fundamental one whose width is proportional to ξ. This is related to nothing but the PSD’s
proper shape and its typical parameters.

FIG. 6. In this ﬁgure the imperturbed theoretical curve related to the linear case and the power spectrum density corre-
sponding to a numerical simulation of the non-linear one are both shown. Data are considered over a period T chosen as
∼ 1200 2π
. In the frequency domain the variations due to non-linearities are concentrated in a band that is as narrow as Q is
ω0
high. It seems that for Q → ∞ even small non-linearities may be revealed

FIG. 7. In this ﬁgure a sketch of how the sensitivity curve for a pendulum is modiﬁed by a non-linear term is shown. As an
example an eﬀective reduction is achieved at low frequencies. The non-linear force causes the pendulum to oscillate with two
important modes. In order to keep small the amplitude of the up-converted fundamental frequency α (which is proportonal to
T ) is expected to be less than 0.1. These results are in accordance with the estimation of our perturbative calculations

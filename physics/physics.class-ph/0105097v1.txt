Abstract

In this paper we address the question of building true signals, fol-
lowing Sommerfeld and Brillouin, through superpositions of superlu-
minal Bessel beams. We ﬁnd that the so-called X waves, which moves
with superluminal phase and group velocities, do not constitute true
signals. Apart from this, we show that it is possible theoretically
to build signals from a large class of superpositions of these beams.
However, the signal velocity in these cases are never greater than the
speed c of light in vacuum, even in the case in which the signal has an
inﬁnite energy, contrary to some claims in the literature. We stress
the analogies between this problem and that of propagation of usual
plane wave packets in a dispersive medium.

1 Introduction

It is well known that Causality Principle in Special Relativity imposes the
speed c of light in vacuum as the upper limit for the velocity of signals (or
interactions) propagation. By the way, the Maxwell equations in material
media allows, in special circumstances such as anomalous dispersion, plane
wave solutions propagating with superluminal (faster than c) phase veloc-
ities [1]. Although these velocities cannot be readily identiﬁed with signal
velocity, the question about the possibility of building a superluminal signal
by superimposing these solutions naturally arise.

This problem was studied by Sommerfeld and Brillouin at the beginning
of last century [2]. Their main conclusions were the following. i) To deﬁne
a signal a wave packet must have a well deﬁned wavefront in its direction
of propagation and ii) the wavefront velocity is never grater than speed c
of light in vacuum, irrespective the material media in which it propagates.
Then, does not matter the detailed deﬁnition of a signal, its velocity can never
to be superluminal, by the obvious reason that the signal can never precedes
its wavefront. In their work Sommerfeld and Brillouin were concerned with
inﬁnite energy wave packets built from homogeneous plane wave solutions of
the scalar wave equation. In vacuum these wave packets propagates rigidly
(i. e. without distortions) with phase, group and signal velocity equal to
c. Within dispersive media the packets experiences distortions, each phase
moving with a diﬀerent phase velocity.
In this situation the concept of a
group velocity can even lost its physical meaning and the precise deﬁnition
of a signal velocity is a complicated question. In despite of this, from the
Sommerfeld and Brillouin results we can conclude that the signal velocity is
never greater than c.

Recently, there is a growing interest on this subject in the literature. For
example, we can quote experiences conﬁrming superluminal velocities in the
passage of wave packets through barriers (see, for example, [3] and references
therein). Up to our knowledge, in these experiments the superluminality is
restricted to group velocity and, following the concepts of Sommerfeld and
Brillouin, the results cannot be extended to signals. As a second exam-
ple, and more important to us, there is a considerably amount of works,
both in theoretical and experimental views, concerning the superluminality
of Bessel beams [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Bessel beams are (inhomogeneous) plane
wave solutions of the scalar wave equation in vacuum which propagares with
superluminal phase velocities. By special superpositions of these beams it

2

is possible to build wave packets, the so-called X waves, which propagates
rigidly in vacuum, with superluminal phase and group velocities. From these
nondispersive properties some authors suggested that this superluminality
can be also associated with signal velocity [5, 6, 7]. This paper has two main
goals. First we show, following Sommerfeld and Brillouin, that X waves do
not deﬁne true signals and therefore the measured superluminality of these
waves does not can be extended to the domain of signal velocity. Second, we
show how to build true signals from a large class of superpositions of Bessel
beams. From this later analysis we identify a mathematical analogy between
the propagation of usual (inhomogeneous) plane wave packets within disper-
sive media and the propagation of Bessel beam packets in vacuum. In par-
ticular, the propagation of Bessel beam packets in vacuum present features
analogous to the propagation of usual plane wave packets within a tenuous
electronic plasma. In this way it is straightforward to conclude, following the
arguments of Sommerfeld and Brillouin, that the Bessel beam signal velocity
in vacuum can never to be greater than the speed c of light.

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present Bessel beam
solutions of the scalar wave equation. In Section 3 we build the most general
superposition of this solutions and classify them into two classes. Within one
class we introduce the X waves, while within the another class we discuss
the analogy between propagation of Bessel beam wave packets in vacuum
and usual (inhomogeneous) plane wave packets within dispersive media. In
Section 4 we deﬁne signals following Sommerfeld and Brillouin and show that
X waves do not satisfy this deﬁnition. Also we show how to build true signals
through superpositions of Bessel beams and show that these signals can not
propagates faster than light in vacuum. Again the referred analogy with
dispersive media clarify our arguments. To ilustrate and to corroborate our
conclusions we work a speciﬁc example, namely the chopped Bessel beam.
By applying our analysis and by explicit calculation we show, contrary to
some claims in the literature, that the wavefront of this inﬁnite energy wave
packet do not move faster than the speed c of light in vacuum. In Section 5
we make our ﬁnal remarks.

2 Bessel beams

As it is well known, from the Maxwell equations we obtain the scalar wave
equation, that must be satisﬁed by each vector component of the electric and

(1)

where n is the refraction index of medium. When n is frequency independent,
as is the case for vacuum, the medium is nondispersive. For the general case
of a dispersive medium, the equation above still holds for monochromatic
In this general case, we can write Ψ(x, t) = A(x, ω)e−iωt and the
waves.
equation to be satisﬁed is

∇2A(x, ω) +

ω2A(x, ω) = 0 .

(2)

[n(ω)]2
c2

We can readily verify that above equation is satisﬁed by the so-called
Bessel beams, which have cilindrical symmetry about z-axis and are given
by

Ψ(kρ,kz)(ρ, z, t) = J0(ρkρ) exp{i(kzz − ωt)} ,
where kρ and kz are arbitrary constants, assumed to be real, J0(x) is the
Bessel function of ﬁrst kind and order zero [1] and

(3)

ω2(kz, kρ) = c2[k2

z + k2

ρ] .

(4)

The surfaces of constant phase are planes perpendicular to z-axis which
moves with phase velocity vp such that
ω

(cid:12)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)

Because the wave amplitude is not constant along these surfaces, Bessel
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
beams are a kind of inhomogeneous plane waves which have superluminal
phase velocities in vacuum. In the case kρ = 0 these solutions degenerate to
usual homogeneous plane waves, with |vp| = c.

|vp| =

≥ c .

(5)

The Bessel beam (3) represent an unidimensional wave motion in the z
direction, whose propagation properties are governed by wave number kz.
Then, if kρ is ﬁxed, expression (4) assumes the known form of the dispersion
relation of a tenuous electronic plasma [1], with plasma frequency given by

Making the reparametrization

ωp = c|kρ| .

kz = k cos θ
kρ = k sin θ ,

(8)

where we can assume, without loss of generality, θ ∈ [0, π] and k ∈ (−∞, ∞),
(3) can be written as

Ψ(k,θ)(ρ, z, t) = J0(ρk sin θ) exp{i(kz cos θ − ωt)} ,

(9)

and dispersion relation (4) is written as [ω(k, θ)]2 = c2k2. Although this
form obscures the analogy with propagation in dispersive media, because kz
is now implicit, obviously all the properties of propagation in z direction are
independent of such reparametrization. The absolute phase velocity, in this
case, is written as

|vp| =

c
| cos θ|

≥ c .

Within this reparametrization the Bessel beams can be viewed as cilindrically
symmetric superpositions of homogeneous plane waves, i. e. [4, 9],

Ψ(k,θ)(ρ, z, t) =

dφ′ei(kn1·x−ωt) ,

2π

Z

where n1 is a unit vector in the propagation direction of the plane wave,
given in cartesian components as

n1 = (sin θ cos φ′, sin θ senφ′, cos θ).

To verify this, we use the notation x = (ρ cos φ, ρ sin φ, z) and turn (12) into
(11). Making so, we have

Ψ(k,θ)(ρ, z, t) = ei(k cos θ−ωt)

(15)

(16)

(17)

where ω(k, θ) = c|k|. The complete description of the wave packet motion
is given through speciﬁcation of spectral distribution A(kρ, kz) in (14). We
split all possibilities for this distribution into two classes, characterized as
follows.

i) kρ and kz are independent, in the sense that A(kρ, kz) can be decom-

posed into the product

A(kρ, kz) = Aρ(kρ)Az(kz) ,

(18)

ii) The above splitting is not possible. In this case we say that kρ and kz

are not independent.

First we shall consider a speciﬁc example of class ii), namely the case of
X waves, which are characterized by a spectral distribution that ﬁxes the θ
angle (called axicon angle) in expansion (16) 1. So, we have
∞

ΨX(ρ, z, t) =

dk S(k)Ψ(k,θ)(ρ, z, t) + c. c.,

(20)

Z

where S(k) is a spectral distribution in total wave number k. By using
representation (11) it is easy to verify that this expression can be written as

(cid:27)

1This means that kρ and kz in (14) are not independent, but constrained by relation

tan θ =

.

Thus X waves can be viewed as cilindrically symmetric superpositions of
usual homogeneous plane wave packets, whose propagation directions make
an angle θ with respect to z axis.

In order to analyse the X wave propagation we turn (9) into (20), obtain-

ing

ΨX(ρ, z, t) =

dk S(k)J0(ρk sin θ) exp[i(kz cos θ − ω(k)t)] + c. c..

(22)

After substituting ω this integral becomes

ΨX(ρ, z, t) =

dk S(k)J0(ρk sin θ) exp[ik(z cos θ + ct)] +

Z
dk S(k)J0(ρk sin θ) exp[ik(z cos θ − ct)] + c. c. .

(23)

This packet represents a superposition of two wave packets, one propagating
to the left and the another to the right along z direction and without distor-
tions, i. e., both packets propagates rigidly, as a whole, with superluminal
phase and group velocities given, in absolute values, by

(24)

In the next section we shall see that X waves do not deﬁne signals and,
therefore, does not make sense to atribute to them a signal velocity.

Now we shall consider superpositions of class i). In this case superposition

(14) can be written as

Ψ(ρ, z, t) =

(25)
First we analyse the situation in which kρ is held ﬁxed. So, up to a coef-
ﬁcient depending on kρ, the kρ integral becomes J0(ρkρ) and the dispersion
relation (15) can be written as

ω(kz) = c

where ωp = c|kρ|. As we said in the previous section, this situation is
strictly analogous to propagation of an usual inhomogeneous plane wave

packet within a dispersive medium. Here the inhomogeneity in radial di-
rection is given by the Bessel function J0(ρkρ).

Now we consider the situation in which both, A(kρ) and A(kz) are strongly
peaked around some ﬁxed values, say k0
z . Thus the main contributions
to integral (25) come from kρ and kz values near k0
z. In this case we
can approximate ω(kρ, kz) by the ﬁrst terms in its Taylor expansion around
these values. Making so, the integral (25) yields

From the above results we conclude that, when kρ and kz can vary in an
independent way, in the sense of (18), the wave packet propagates in vacuum
In special, when
presenting features of propagation in dispersive media.
Aρ(kρ) is strongly peaked around some value k0
ρ, the wave packet propagates
along z direction in a way analogous to usual (inhomogeneous) plane waves
propagating within a tenuous electronic plasma (or within an arbitrary media
in the high frequency limit [1]) , with plasma frequency given by ωp = c|k0
ρ|.
Besides that, if Az(kz) is also strongly peaked around some value k0
z , the
wave packet moves along z axis approximately without dispersion and with
group velocity given by (28), which is obviously less than the speed c of light
in vacuum.

4 Signals

Now we address the question of building signals from superpositions of Bessel
beams. Following Sommerfeld and Brillouin [2], we say that a wave packet

8

deﬁne a signal only if it has a well deﬁned wavefront into its direction of
propagation in some initial instant of time. Equivalently, the wave packet
must have a well deﬁned wavefront in time in some plane perpendicular to
its direction of propagation.

First of all, we shall consider X waves. By representation (21) we recall
that these waves can be viewed as cilindrically symmetric superpositions of
usual homogeneous plane waves tilted over z axis by an angle θ.
Ideally,
plane waves have inﬁnite extension perpendicularly to its direction of prop-
agation. Therefore, we conclude that X waves, does not matter the form of
spectral distribution S(k), have not a well deﬁned wavefront into z direction
in any instant of time. Equivalently, in a given plane perpendicular to the
propagation direction, say z = 0, X waves have not a well deﬁned wave-
front in time. This happens even in the case in which the superimposing
homogeneous plane waves have a well deﬁned wavefront in its direction of
propagation (n1 in (12)). In this case the X wave wavefront has the form of
an inﬁnite inside conic surface symmetric with respect to z axis. Obviously,
the projection of this wavefront onto z axis has not a well deﬁned beginning.
From the above arguments we conclude that X waves propagating in z
direction do not deﬁne signals propagating in this direction. Therefore, does
not make sense to atribute to them a signal velocity.

By the way, ﬁnite aperture approximations to X waves can produce wave
packets that are true signals. However, we will show next that in this case
the wavefront propagates with speed not greater than that of light in vacuum
and the packet distortes while propagates, presenting features analogous of
propagation within a dispersive medium, according to the results of previous
section.

We consider now the building of signals through superpositions of class
i) in all its generality. The general expression for a wave packet in this class
is given by (25). For a moment we will restrict us again to case in which
kρ is held ﬁxed. Then, as we saw in previous section, the wave packet (25)
becomes, appart some real coeﬃcient depending only on kρ,
∞

Ψ(kρ)(ρ, z, t) = J0(ρkρ)

dkz Az(kz) exp{i(kzz − ωt)} + c. c. .

(31)

−∞

Z

The dispersion relation between ω and kz assumes the known form (26) for
a tenuous electronic plasma.

Considering the above integral the situation is now completely analogous
to the propagation of an usual plane wave packet within a dispersive medium

9

and along z direction. Thus, at this point we could readily use the results of
Sommerfeld and Brillouin analysis to conclude that a signal built accordingly
to (31) can never propagates with a superluminal velocity. However, for the
sake of clarity, we prefer sketch the main steps of the complete analysis.
Then, for wave packet (31) to deﬁne a signal propagating along z direction
it must have a well deﬁned wavefront, say at z=0, in a given initial instant
of time, say t = 0. Then, it must satisfy the following initial conditions

(32)

(33)

(34)

Ψ(kρ)(ρ, z, 0) = J0(ρkρ)Ψ0(z) ;

∂Ψ(kρ)
∂t

(ρ, z, 0) = J0(ρkρ) ˙Ψ0(z) ,

where Ψ0(z) and ˙Ψ0(z) are arbitrary functions of z that vanish for z > 0. The
spectral distribution Az(kz) in (31) is completely determined by the following
relation [1]

Az(kz) =

#

It is well known that the above integral, together with conditions (32-33),
leads to a distribution Az(kz) analytical in the upper half of complex kz-
plane. The singularities in the lower half plane are determined by the exact
form of Ψ0(z) and ˙Ψ0(z). Moreover, Az(kz) will be well behaved at the
complex inﬁnity2, in such a sense that the integrand in (31) satisfy Jordan’s
Lemma and we can compute the integral as a contour integral in the complex
kz-plane. As |kz| → ∞, the dispersion relation (26) behaves as ω(kz) → c|kz|
and the exponential argument in the integrand behaves as

i[kzz − ω(kz)t] → ikz[z − sgn(kz)ct] .

(35)

In general we have two wave packets, one propagating to the left and the
another to the right along the z direction3. To study the signal velocity we
consider the region z > 0 for times t > 0, i. e., we shall consider only the
wave packet moving to right. Thus, from (35) we see that when z −ct > 0 the

2The behaviour of Az(kz) at inﬁnity is governed by the behaviour of the term into
brackets in (34) at t → 0. For Physically plausible conditions (32-33) Azkz will be well
behaved as |kz| → ∞, in such a manner the integrand in (31) satisfy Jordan’s Lemma.

3Each one of these packets corresponds to one of the two terms when we split the kz

integral (31) into

−∞ and

contour must be closed in the upper half plane, where Az(kz) is analytical
and, therefore, the integral (31) vanishes. So, the wave packet amplitude is
zero for z − ct > 0. From the above analysis we conclude that the wavefront
of signal (31) can never propagate faster than the speed c of light in vacuum 4.
Now we remove the restriction of kρ being ﬁxed. By allowing kρ to vary,

the superposition (25) assumes the form

Ψ(ρ, z, t) =

dkρ Aρ(kρ)Ψ(kρ)(ρ, z, t) .

(37)

∞

−∞

Z

This last integral is nothing more than a linear superposition of signals,
each having a well deﬁned wavefront in z = 0 at t = 0. As we saw, these
wavefronts can not move towards z > 0 with a velocity greater than that of
light in vacuum. Therefore, it is straightforward to conclude that the whole
superposition also will have a well deﬁned wavefront in z = 0 at t = 0, which
propagates towards z > 0 with a speed not greater than c.

Summarizing, considering class i) superpositions in all its generality we
were able to build true signals, accordingly to Sommerfeld and Brillouin, and
we have shown that these signals can never propagates with a velocity greater
than that of light in vacuum.

Now we shall work an explicit example, given in [8]. We start from
general superposition (14), without any assumption about the spectral dis-
tribution A(kρ, kz).
In order to compare the results, and also to ilustrate
the equivalence between the deﬁnitions of signals we give at the beggining of
this section, we rewrite this superposition in a way to consider kρ and ω as
independent parameters, instead of kρ and kz,

a rectangular pulse at z = 0. Equivalently, these conditions can represent
a Bessel beam with the same features described above but modulated by
rectangular pulses in z direction at t = 0.

We can determine the spectral distribution A(kρ, ω) in (38) from condi-

tions (40-41). It is straightforward to verify that

So, we conclude that wave packet (38), with boundary conditions (40-41),

belongs to class i) superpositions. Specially, it is an example of signal (31),
in which the spectral distribution factorizes in such a manner that kρ is held
ﬁxed. Thus, using our previous results, we assert that this signal propagates
in vacuum in a way analogously to an usual inhomogeneous plane wave packet
within a dispersive medium. Specially, even although being an inﬁnite energy
wave packet, the signal velocity is never greater than the speed c of light in
vacuum, contrary to the claims of reference [8]5.

Now, making a linear superposition of these last wave packets via a spec-
tral distribution S(ω0) we obtain a chopped X wave which obviously deﬁnes
a true signal. By our previous analysis, we conclude that the signal velocity
is not greater than c, does not matter the speciﬁc form of S(ω0)6.

5 Concluding remarks

In this paper we analysed the question of building wave packets from Bessel
beams. Specially we were concerned with wave packets deﬁning signals, ac-
cordingly to Sommerfeld and Brillouin. We ﬁrst considered the so-called X
waves, which were extensively studied in the literature and are special su-
perpositions of Bessel beams. We shown that these waves do not constitute
true signals into its direction of propagation, because they do not have a well
deﬁned wavefront in time along any plane perpendicular to this direction or,

The integration is straightforward, since the integrand satisﬁes the conditions of Jordan’s
Lemma and thus we can perform the integral in the standard way as a contour integral in
the complex ω-plane.

6At this point we remark that we could naively try to build a signal from the X wave
superposition (22) by assuming that S(k) spectral distribution were analytical in the
upper complex k-plane. Nevertheless, we cannot compute the corresponding integral by
the standard technic of residues, because the integrand (particularly the Bessel function
J0) is not well behaved at complex inﬁnity.

equivalently, they do not have a well deﬁned wavefront into its direction of
propagation at any instant of time. After, within a large class of superposi-
tions of Bessel beams, which we named class i), we shown that it is possible
to build true signals. We shown that within this class the wave packets
propagates in vacuum in a way analogous to usual (inhomogeneous) plane
wave packets propagation within dispersive media. In this way, the classical
arguments of Sommerfeld and Brillouin proof about the maximum speed of
signal propagation readily apply. We sketched the main steps of that prove
and worked two special Bessel beams signals, the chopped Bessel beam and
a ﬁnite aperture approximation for a X wave. We shown that these two wave
packets belong to class i) superpositions and, therefore, their signal velocity
are never greater than the speed c of light in vacuum, even although being
inﬁnite energy wave packets, contrary to some claims in the literature [7, 8].

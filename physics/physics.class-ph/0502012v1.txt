Spacetime Deformations and Electromagnetism in Material

Media

Abstract

This paper is intended to investigate the relation between electrodynamics in anisotropic

material media and its analogous formulation in an spacetime, with non-null Riemann curva-

ture tensor. After discussing the electromagnetism via chiral diﬀerential forms, we point out

the optical activity of a given material medium, closely related to topological spin, and the

Faraday rotation, associated to topological torsion. Both quantities are deﬁned in terms of

the magnetic potential and the electric and magnetic ﬁelds and excitations. We revisit some

properties of material media and the associated Green dyadics. Some related features of fer-

rite are also investigated. It is well-known that the constitutive tensor is essentially equivalent

to the Riemann curvature tensor. In order to investigate the propagation of electromagnetic

waves in material media, we prove that it is analogous to consider the electromagnetic wave

propagation in the vacuum, but this time in a curved spacetime, which is obtained by a

deformation of the lorenztian metric of Minkowski spacetime. Spacetime deformations leave

invariant the form of Maxwell equations. Also, there exists a close relation between Maxwell

equations in curved spacetime and in an anisotropic material medium, indicating that elec-

tromagnetism and spacetime properties are deeply related. For instance, the equations of

holomorphy in Minkowski spacetime are essentially Maxwell equations in vacuum. Besides,

the geometrical aspects of wave propagation can be described by an eﬀective geometry which

represents a modiﬁcation of the lorentzian metric of Minkowski spacetime, i.e., a kind of

spacetime deformation.

Key words: electromagnetism, constitutive tensor, Green dyadic, optical activity, Faraday

rotation, spacetime deformations.

Introduction

The metric-free formulation of electromagnetism is an old concept [1, 6, 9, 22, 28, 31, 33,

35, 10], and it is more natural, correct, precise and geometrically sensible if diﬀerential forms,

intrinsically endowed with chirality [16, 28], are used [13, 33]. The excitations1 D(x), H(x)
(respectively the electric displacement and the magnetic ﬁeld) and the ﬁelds E(x), B(x) (re-

spectively the electric ﬁeld and the magnetic induction) are naturally described in a spacetime

destituted of a metric, which is introduced only when the constitutive relations are to be

deﬁned. The metric-free (and aﬃne-free) formulation of electrodynamics brings a geometric

character and a clear physical interpretation. But if we want to relate the Faraday excitation

2-form ﬁeld G(x) and the electromagnetic ﬁeld strenght 2-form ﬁeld F (x), we need to consider

a constitutive tensor χ, that gives the relation G(x) = χF (x). Equivalently, spacetime must

be endowed with a metric, since the constitutive law depends on the spacetime metric [9] .

The constitutive tensor (CT) is more than a relation between F (x) and G(x), describing

physical intrinsic properties of matter or spacetime. It is essentially the Hodge star operator

[15] that, besides the well-known duality between k-forms and (n

k)-forms in a n-dimensional

vector space (endowed with a metric), changes the parity of diﬀerential forms, but with an

additional information about the medium structure. In this sense, CT describes the properties

of spacetime (magnetic) permeability and (electric) permittivity, since a general medium can

be arbitrarily anisotropic. Under this viewpoint, a CT immediately brings a light-cone con-

formal structure to spacetime [15]. Formally, the link between CT and spacetime structure is

expected, since CT and the Riemann curvature tensor have the same mathematical properties.

−

A CT can reveal precious informations about spacetime, for example, the CT scalar curvature

is identically null in any medium possessing central symmetry [33].

In this paper the CT χ that describes any linear (in particular, crystalline) media, in

the general case presenting optical activity, is expressed by a conformal transformation of

the vacuum CT χ0. The metric associated to the medium is derived from the CT (up to

a conformal factor) and vice-versa [20, 22, 23, 25].

In this sense, the lorentzian metric of

Minkowski spacetime, associated with χ0, is deformed into a general metric of a riemannian

spacetime, related to χ.

We prove that in order to completely describe the CT of any linear medium presenting

natural optical activity, we only need the matrix γ, that describes the optical activity of

such a medium, and χ0.

In the particular investigation of crystalline media, we describe

the constitutive tensor associated to the 32 crystal classes presenting natural optical activity

uniquely from χ0, i.e., from the spacetime metric, since χ0 can be written as second order

metric tensor combination [22, 20]. This paper is organized as follows:

in Sec. 1 we review

the geometric description of ﬁelds and excitations in electromagnetic theory, well-established

originally in the papers by Maxwell [21], Sch¨onberg [10], Hehl [22], Kiehn [31], Post [33]

and Jancewicz [27, 28], among others. The Maxwell equations carry information about the

nature of the diﬀerent ﬁelds and excitations, and the theory arises with an essential geometric

character, if the ﬁelds and excitations are correctly interpreted, as in [27, 28, 22, 33], as even

and odd diﬀerential form ﬁelds. In Sec. 2 we revisit the main features of electromagnetism in

anisotropic material media. The Green dyadic is obtained and we treat the particular case of

a electrically anisotropic material media. Plane waves are investigated, illustrating the present

approach. Also, optically active media are treated. For instance, ferrite is explicitly studied.

In Sec. 3 Maxwell equations in curved spacetime and in an anisotropic material medium

are proved to be equivalent.

It sheds some new light on the diﬀerential geometric aspects

of electromagnetic wave propagation, that can be described by a geometry which represents

1We follow the nomenclature given in [22].

a modiﬁcation of the metric in Minkowski spacetime. We prove that all the information

contained in the constitutive tensor associated to any linear media (arbitrarily describing

optical activity), is precisely given by the vacuum constitutive tensor and by the matrix that

describes the optical activity associated with the medium. Such matrix is essentially viewed

as a perturbation of the original constitutive tensor that does not describe optically active

media. Finally, in the Appendix, the main results concerning diﬀerential forms are reviewed.

From now on we call an even (odd) diﬀerential form ﬁeld the one that doesn’t (does) change

Hom(R6, R6)) and
using the bivectorial notation, (where the indices I, J, . . . = 01, 02, 03, 23, 31, 12 are deﬁned) we
can see from eq.(74) that the matrix χIJ is symmetric (χIJ = χJ I ), and there exists (6
independent componentes in χ. Using physical arguments, one can show that in uniform media

elements of the group. This kind of structure in electromagnetism was discovered by Bateman

[39], who was the ﬁrst to observe that the Maxwell equations are invariant under the conformal

group [31, 32].

Note that the expression above is the constitutive relation for any crystalline material, and

it depends only of the matrix γ (given at the end of Sec. 3, for all crystal classes), that

describes optical natural activity. Then it can be seen as the deformation of the metric of

Minkowski spacetime into a metric of curved riemannian spacetime, since in order to describe

the constitutive relations of any crystalline medium we only need the metric of Minkowski

spacetime.

In particular, it is also possible to express, from the lorentzian metric of Minkowski space-

time, the constitutive tensor associated to the dielectric and magnetic Faraday rotations, and

the natural optical activity in arbitrary rotational symmetric media. It is respectively given

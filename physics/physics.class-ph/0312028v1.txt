Hidden Momentum in a Coaxial Cable

(March 28, 2002)

Calculate the electromagnetic momentum and identify the “hidden” mechanical momentum
in a coaxial cable of length L, inner radius a, outer radius b, when a battery is connected
to one end and a load resistor R0 is connected to the other. The current may be taken as
uniformly distributed over the inner conductor, which has resistivity ρ. The outer conductor
has negligible resistivity, and the current ﬂows on it in a thin sheet at radius b.

1 Problem

2 Solution

This problem is based on sec. 17 of [1], and on prob. 7.57, ex. 8.3 and ex. 12.12 of [2].

We denote the resistance per unit length along inner conductor as

Then, the total resistance of the cable plus load resistor is R0 + RL. To have current I in
the system, the battery must have voltage

The current I causes a magnetic ﬁeld that is readily calculated via Amp`ere’s law to be
(in Gaussian units, and in a cylindrical coordinate system (r, φ, z) with the coaxial cable
centered on the z axis),

R =

Inside the wire the electric ﬁeld is E(r < a) = IRˆz, as needed to drive the current I against
the resistivity ρ. Since the tangential component of the electric ﬁeld is continuous across a
boundary, there must be some electric ﬁeld in the region r > a as well. Indeed, a charge
distribution Q(z) is needed on the surface of the inner conductor to shape the interior electric
ﬁeld to be purely longitudinal.

An analysis of the electric ﬁeld can be based on the convention that the electric potential
V (r, z) is equal to zero on the outer conductor, and is also zero on the plane z = 0 (which
is not necessarily inside the wire of length L). That is, we suppose the cable extends from
z = −L − R0/R (the position of the battery) to z = −R0/R (the position of the resistor),
so that the electric potential for r ≤ a can be written as

V (r ≤ a, z) = −IRz.

Thus, the potential of the inner conductor at the position of the load resistor is IR0, and
the potential at the position of the battery is IR(L + R0/R), i.e., the battery voltage (2).

The capacitance per unit length between the inner and outer conductors of the coaxial

cable is well known to be

C =

1
2 ln(b/a)

.

The charge Q(z) per unit length on the inner conductor is therefore

Q(z) = CV (r = a, z) = −

IRz
2 ln(b/a)

=

IRz
2 ln(a/b)

,

assuming that L ≫ b so that Q(z) is essentially constant over length ∆z ≪ b. Further, the
potential in the region a < r < b is essentially that for a long wire of charge density Q(z),
matched to the condition that V (r = b) = 0, namely

V (a < r < b, z) = −2Q(z) ln(r/b) = −

IRz ln(r/b)
ln(a/b)

,

which also matches eq. (4) at r = a. The potential (7) can also be obtained by a separation-
of-variables solution to Laplace’s equation [1].

The electric ﬁeld is obtained by taking the gradient of eq. (7), and we ﬁnd

The Poynting vector S quantiﬁes the ﬂow of energy from the battery in the region (a <

We expect the total momentum of the system to be zero, as its center of mass is at
rest, even though there is internal motion associated with the electrical current. A small

amount of mechanical momentum is “hidden” in the conduction electrons because the ratio
1 − v2/c2 is
of mechanical momentum density to current density is γme/e, where γ = 1/
velocity dependent, and the velocity of the electrons is higher in the inner conductor than in
the outer [2, 3]. The factor of c2 in the denominator of eq. (10) alerts us to the relativistic
origin of the mechanical momentum that opposes the electromagnetic momentum.

It remains somewhat diﬃcult to quantify the velocity diﬀerence of the conduction elec-
trons in diﬀerent parts of the circuit. The usual model of conduction is that the drift velocity
is constant in regions of constant electric ﬁeld, so we are led to state that the (average) ve-
locity of all conduction electrons in the inner conduction is −vaˆz, and that a single velocity
vbˆz characterizes the motion of electrons in the outer conductor. The electric ﬁelds in the
battery and the load resistor vary with radius as 1/r, and the battery provides an additional
electromotive force, not describable by an ordinary electric ﬁeld, that is the source of energy
to drive the electrons through the circuit.

Perhaps the most straightforward hypothesis is that as the electrons of charge −e pass
through the battery, the electromotive force increases their energy by eV > 0. However,
this does not result in a value for the mechanical momentum that is equal and opposite the
electromagnetic momentum, as is particularly clear for the case of a cable that runs from
−L/2 to L/2 with batteries of voltage IRL/2 at both ends, for which PEM = 0.

A prescription that achieves the desired goal, and is consistent with the assumption
that the velocities va and vb are constant throughout their respective conductors, is that
the energy gain of the conduction electrons is given by the potential diﬀerence between the
centers of the inner and outer conductors, i.e., by the average of the potential diﬀerence at
the two ends. This prescription supposes that the energy transfer to the conduction electrons
as they move radially at one end of the cable is aﬀected by the situation at the other end of
the cable, no matter how distant. While this is counterintuitive, it is not contradictory for
a steady-state situation.

Under the above assumption, the energy gain of the conduction electrons between the

inner and outer conductors implies that

me(γa − γb)c2 = ∆U =

[∆V (−L − R0/R) + ∆V (−R0/R)] = eI(RL/2 + R0).

Labeling the conduction electron density per unit length in the inner and outer conductors
as na and nb, we have

I = enava = enbvb,

(12)

and so the mechanical momentum in the current is

Pmech = (−meγanaLva + meγbnbLvb)ˆz = −

I 2RL
2c2 (L + 2R0/R)ˆz. (13)
This cancels the electromagnetic momentum (10), and the total momentum of the system
(which is “at rest”) is zero.

(γa − γb)ˆz = −

Another conﬁrmation of the result (10) can be found by supposing the current I drops to
zero with time. The changing magnetic ﬁeld induces a longitudinal electric ﬁeld that pushes
on the charge on the surface of the inner conductor, leading to a force on the wire. The force
on the conduction electrons merely slows the decrease of the current, but does not cause a

This result reinforces the interpretation of eq. (10) as ﬁeld momentum stored in the system,
that could be converted to mechanical momentum. Of course, as the current drops to zero,
the “hidden” mechanical momentum does also. The total momentum is zero at all times,
and the ﬁeld momentum is not transformed into net motion of the coaxial cable.

Since the nonzero electromagnetic momentum of a coaxial cable at rest is always canceled
by the “hidden” mechanical momentum, both of these entities can be safely neglected by
the pragmatic physicist in this case. Electromagnetic momentum is of greater signiﬁcance in
dynamic phenomena, in which the mechanical momentum is “evident” rather than “hidden”,
and in which Newton’s 3rd law for “evident” mechanical momentum is not satisﬁed unless
the electromagnetic momentum is taken into account [4].

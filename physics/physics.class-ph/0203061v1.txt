Abstract A long cylindrical body of circular cross-section and homogeneous
density may ﬂoat in all orientations around the cylinder axis. It is shown that
there are also bodies of non-circular cross-sections which may ﬂoat in any direc-
tion. Apart from those found by Auerbach for ρ = 1/2 there are one-parameter
= 1/2 which have a p-fold rotation axis. For given
families of cross-sections for ρ

Introduction

A long standing problem asked by Stanislaw Ulam in the Scottish Book [1]
(problem 19) is, whether a sphere is the only solid of uniform density which will
ﬂoat in water in any position. A simpler, two-dimensional, question is: Consider
a long log of circular cross-section; it will, obviously, ﬂoat in any position without
tending to rotate. (Of course, the axis of the log is assumed to be parallel to
the water surface.) Are there any additional cross-section shapes such that the
log will ﬂoat in any position? This question was answered in 1938 by Auerbach
[2] for the special density ρ = 1/2 (the density of water is normalized to unity).
He showed, that for this special density there is a large variety of cross-sections.
= 1/2. We observe that for special densities one
may deform the circular cross-section into one with p-fold symmetry axis and
2 densities, for which this is possible. For given
mirror symmetry. There are p
p the densities appear pairwise as ρ and 1
ρ. For odd p there is also a solution
for ρ = 1/2. These solutions can be expanded in powers of the deformation ǫ.
In polar coordinates (r, ψ) they are written

Here we consider the case ρ

= 1/2 is treated in ﬁrst order of the
distortion in section 4 and in higher orders in section 5. Section 6 contains a
short conclusion.

2 General Considerations

I start with some considerations for general densities ρ.
I denote the cross-
section area of the log by A, the cross-section above the water be A1, that
below the water A2, then

A1 = (1

ρ)A, A2 = ρA

−

according to Archimedes. Moreover I denote by m the total mass of the log,
by m1,2 the masses above/below the water-line, by C1,2 the center of mass
above/below the water-line, by h1,2 the distance of C1,2 from the water-line,
and by ˆL the length of the log.

Then the potential energy of the system is

V = m1gh1 + (m

m2)gh2 = ρA1 ˆLh1g + (A2 ˆL

A2ρ ˆL)gh2

−

= ρ(1

−

−
ρ)A ˆLg(h1 + h2).

Thus the diﬀerence in height between the two centers of mass, h1 + h2, has to be
independent of the orientation of the log. This does not imply, that h1 and h2
are separately constant. Moreover the line C1C2 connecting the two centers of
mass has to be perpendicular to the water-level. In the following I will consider
convex simple connected cross-sections. This condition may be relaxed, but it
is necessary, that the water-level crosses the circumference of the log at exactly
two points denoted by L and R. The distance between these two points be 2l.

Let us consider now what happens if we rotate the log by an inﬁnitesimal
angle δφ. Since the area above and below the water has to be conserved the
rotation is around the midpoint M of the line LR. Then on the right the area
l2δφ/2 rises above the water and on the left the same area disappears below
the water-level. Let us consider the shift of the centers of mass in horizontal

direction. There are two changes: Due to the rotation C1 moves to the left by
δφh1 and C2 to the right by δφh2. The appearance of the area l2δφ/2 on the
right and the disappearance of the same area on the left moves the center C1 of
3 δφl3/A1 to the right. Similarly the center

In total the shift to the right of C1 is (

) = h1 + h2.

(4)

Since the distance h1 + h2 has to be constant and also A1 and A2 are constant,
we obtain the important result, that also l is constant. If (4) is not fulﬁlled,
but the left hand side is larger then the right hand side, then the log is in
stable equilibrium, if the left hand side is less then the right hand side then the
equilibrium is unstable. But here we are interested in an indiﬀerent equilibrium,
where equality (4) holds.

When we continue to rotate the log, then in general the mid-point M between
L and R will move. It can move only along the direction of the line LR. We
consider now the loci of the points M as a function of φ. In order to do this
we keep however the orientation of the log ﬁxed and rotate the direction of
the gravitational force and the orientation of the watersurface. Since M can
move only in direction of the line LR whose slope is now given by tan φ we can
parametrize the loci of M by xM (φ) and yM (φ), where s(φ)dφ is the shift of M
along LR as we rotate by dφ. It is now obvious that the solution of the problem
can be parametrized by

xR(φ) = xM (φ) + l cos φ,

yR(φ) = yM (φ) + l sin φ,

(5)

xM (φ) = xM (0) +

s(φ) cos φ dφ,

yM (φ) = yM (0) +

s(φ) sin φ dφ.(6)

φ

Z

xM (φ) and yM (φ) parametrize the envelope of the water-lines LR. Considering
the boundary of the log we observe, that the part of the circumference which
disappears on one side under rotation by δφ below the water-line and appears
on the other side is √s2 + l2δφ on both sides, since in horizontal direction
the contribution is sdφ and in vertical direction ldφ. Thus the part of the
circumference below the waterline is constant independent of the orintation.
Obviously the envelope of the water-line must be closed, that is

s(φ) cos φ dφ = 0,

s(φ) sin φ dφ = 0

(7)

It must be noted however, that the boundary of the log is not only given by
eq. (5), but it is also obtained by reversing the sign of l, that is not only by
considering the points R but also the points L

xL(χ) = xM (χ)

l cos χ,

yL(χ) = yM (χ)

l sin χ.

(8)

The problem is now to ﬁnd envelopes, parametrized by s(φ), so that both de-
scriptions coincide. Of course the arguments φ and χ are diﬀerent in both
expressions in order to describe the same point on the boundary.

3 The case ρ = 1
2

In the special case ρ = 1
2 one has A1 = A2 = A/2, with the implication that for
φ and φ + π one has the same line LR separating the part of the log above and
that below the water-level, only L and R are exchanged, but M is the same for
φ and χ = φ + π

xM (φ) = xM (φ + π),

yM (φ) = yM (φ + π).

If we diﬀerentiate these equations with respect to φ using the representation (6)
we obtain the condition

The conditions (10) and (11) and a suﬃcient ’convexity’ is suﬃcient to obtain a
body which ﬂows in each direction. Curves of this type were already discussed
by Zindler in section 6 of [3] but apparently without reference to this physical
problem.

As an example we consider

boundary. We may e.g. choose a triangle as envelope of the waterlines. Then

4.1 Linearization
We assume, that the quantities ˆr, ˆs, ˆφ, ˆχ are small quantities, which can be
expanded in powers of an expansion parameter ǫ. Suppose we have solved the
equations (23) to (26) up to some order in ǫ and wish to calculate the next
order. Then by expanding these equations in powers of ǫ we may extract the
contributions in this new order. The linear terms in this new order are unknown,
the non-linear ones are already known. We bring the linear terms on the left-
hand side of the equations (23) to (26) and the other terms on the right-hand
side. This yields the equations

This arbitrary choice of ˆr±1 is related to the translational invariance of the
problem. We are free to move the system by (δx, δy). Then also the angle ψ
and the distance r from the origin will change,

¯x(ψ + δψ) = ¯r(ψ + δψ) cos(ψ + δψ) = x(ψ) + δx = r(ψ) cos ψ + δx, (45)
¯y(ψ + δψ) = ¯r(ψ + δψ) sin(ψ + δψ) = y(ψ) + δy = r(ψ) sin ψ + δy. (46)

With ¯r(ψ) = r(ψ) + δr(ψ) one obtains

(r(ψ + δψ)) + δr) cos(ψ + δψ) = r(ψ) cos(ψ) + δx,
(r(ψ + δψ)) + δr) sin(ψ + δψ) = r(ψ) sin(ψ) + δy.

ρ0 are also solutions. For odd p one has in addition the
and the densities 1
solution δ0 = 0 and ρ0 = 1/2. In total we have p
2 solutions δ0 for given p
without the unphysical solutions cos δ0 = 0 (see the discussion after eq. 88).
Thus with increasing p the densities become arbitrarily dense.

We may also add some ˆs0, which however will not change the circular shape

but the density in ﬁrst order in ˆs0.

5 Higher Orders in the Distortion

Our strategy will now be to calculate the contributions to ˆIk in higher orders
in the distortion. As long as k
= p, this will yield contributions to ˆsk which
depend in higher orders on ˆs0,±p, but we have also to make sure, that ˆI0 and
ˆI±p vanish in all orders in the distortion.

δ0,
π + δ0, s and r in a Fourier-series which contains only terms proprtional

einpψ with integer n. The reason is, that we wish to keep the p-fold rotation axis.
Then only components eimψ are allowed, which for ψ
ψ + 2π/p reproduce
themselves, thus eim2π/p = 1 is required, which implies, that m is an integer
multiple of p. For our expansion we use now sp = u and s−p = v as expansion

5.2 The Expansion

In determining the expansion coeﬃcients cr, cs, cφ, and cχ we proceed as follows.
First we expand the equations (27) to (30) in powers of umvn. Then we solve
the coeﬃcient equations with increasing n + m. From the four equations with
coeﬃcients umvn we use the ﬁrst three ones in order to express crm,n, cφm,n,
and cχm,n by the coeﬃcients with either smaller m or n, which appear in the
> 1, then we may
expressions I1..4,m,n and by the coeﬃcient csm,n. If
use the fourth equation in order to determine csm,n. If m = n, then due to the
reﬂection symmetry I3,n,n = I4,n,n and thus ˆI = 0. Thus the four equations are
linearly dependent and csn,n is undetermined at this stage. When we come to
m = n + 1, n, then in general ˆIn+1,n will not vanish. However it depends on
csn,n, which is not yet determined. csn,n enters in the form

for even p. For odd p the factor i is absent. Thus csn,n is uniquely determined
from ˆIn+1,n = 0. csn+1,n is already ﬁxed to be zero with the exception of n = 0,
where we have normalized it to cs1,0 = 1. Due to the reﬂection symmetry the

11

equations for n, n + 1 are simultaneously solved. A problem could occur, if
not only ˆC±p = ˆC0 = 0, but also for some m one would have ˆCmp = 0. In
our calculations which we performed up to m + n = 7, we did not observe any
dangerous denominators in the coeﬃcients. The denominators of cr, cφ, and cχ
contained only powers of p2, p2
1, and W (see below), and the denominators
of cs only powers of p2, despite of the more complicated expressions ˆCnp, which
one might have expected in the denominators.

The expansion was performed by use of Maple. In order to implement the

condition ˆCp = 0, eq.(37) I used the representation

If this expansion continues in higher orders without dependence on δ0, which

For ρ = 1/2 all determinants (k2

1) ˆCk vanish for odd k. This is the source
for the large variety of cross-sections at ρ = 1/2. We may, however, use the
above equations, which were initially solved for general cδ0 and sδ0 and ﬁnally
insert sδ0 = 0, cδ0 = 1, and again we obtain the same boundary (to seventh
order in ǫ).

−

13

±

Finally we may reconsider the solution cδ0 = 0, sδ0 =

1. In this special
case formally the boundary and the envelope of water-lines agree. However, the
parametrization is diﬀerent, since r is given as a function of the polar angle ψ,
whereas xM , yM are given as function of the direction of the tangent on the
curve. Despite the fact that there is no solution for ρ = 0 and ρ = 1 except
the circle (in this case the height of the center of gravity above or below the
water-line has to be constant, which according to Montejano [4] is only fulﬁlled
by a circle), our equations are fulﬁlled for arbitrary closed boundaries, since in
this limit l = 0 and thus always φ = χ. That cδ0 = 0 appears as a multiple
solution is probably a consequence of the fact, that the ﬁctitious water-line is
parallel to the boundary and thus the coincidence of R and L′ is fulﬁlled in
higher orders. We note that formal substitution of cδ0 = 0 and sδ0 =
1 again
yields the same boundary.

±

There remains the question of the convergency of the ǫ-expansion.

I do
not have a deﬁnite answer to this. However, if one describes the boundary by
xM , yM for cδ0 = 0, then it is apparent, that there is a unique solution only
as long as the cross-section is convex, since otherwise xM , yM are no longer
unique functions of φ. Thus the radius of convergency cannot be larger then the
1/(2p2). From
maximal ǫ for a convex boundary, which can be estimated ǫ
the numerical calculations it seems likely, that this is the radius of convergency
for cδ0 = 0. For larger cδ0 , that is for ρ closer to 1/2 the radius of convergency
seems to be larger.

≈

We show now several examples. For given p and ǫ we have plotted points of
the envelope of the water-line for diﬀerent ρ in intervals of 60 = π/30 and the
corresponding points on the boundary for various cases. For odd p I include the
1/(2p2), I also include the points for cδ0 = 0,
result for ρ = 1/2. As long as ǫ
which lie on the boundary. All points have been calculated from the expansion
of xM , yM to order ǫ7.

6 Conclusion

2 densities. From the ρ

Here we have shown, that for densities diﬀerent from 1/2 it is possible to have
logs with non-circular cross-sections, which ﬂoat indiﬀerently in all orientations
around the axis. The cross-sections which are presented have a p-fold rotation
axis and p mirror lines. For each p we have a one-parameter family of solutions at
p
ρ symmetry it is expected, that the solutions
are pairwise equal. However, the expansion in the deformation parameter ǫ
2 equal solutions up to order ǫ7, from which I conjecture, that one
yields p
2 densities.
and the same manifold of cross-sections ﬂoats indiﬀerently for all p
It would be very useful to obtain the curves in a non-perturbative way, in order
to verify or falsify the conjecture.

We have obtained these solutions by deforming the circular solution. One
may also try to deform the solutions for ρ = 1/2 or the solutions here obtained
by looking, if for some ǫ again a non-trivial deformation is possible which might
yield a solution of even lower symmetry.

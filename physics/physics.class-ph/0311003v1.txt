This note considers two related topics regarding the self-induced charge current in the exper-
iments detecting photon rest mass: (i) the eﬀective rest mass, (0.3 ∼ 1) × 10−54 Kg, of photons
arising from the ions in the secondary cosmic ray is compared to Luo et al.’s new upper limit on
−54 Kg); (ii) there are two main classes of experiments to detect photon
photon rest mass (1.2 × 10
rest mass based respectively on the Amp`ere-Maxwell-Proca equation and the Lagrangian (or Hamil-
tonian) density of electromagnetically interacting system.

During the last three decades, photon rest mass problem captured special attention of many investigators who
have reported several experimental upper limits on the photon mass mγ by using various methods [1–9]. Since the
radiation from pulsars and/or certain explosive astrophysical events at high redshift can be used to place the severe
limits on both the fractional variation (△c/c) in the speed of light with frequency and the photon rest mass [10],
in 1969 Feinberg analyzed the data obtained in the detection of the sharply deﬁned radio and optical pulses from
47 Kg [1]. Goldhaber et al. discussed the
pulsars and indicated that the rest mass of a real photon is less than 10−
method used to set a limit on the photon rest mass (e.g., sensitive techniques which test Coulomb’s law and its analog
in magnetostatics) and showed that the laboratory tests of Coulomb’s law [2] gave an upper limit on photon rest
50 Kg and the constant “external” magnetic ﬁeld experiment at the Earth’s surface obtained a limit
mass of 2 × 10−
51 Kg [3]. The experiments of Pioneer-10 measurement of Jovian magnetic ﬁeld [5] and hydromagnetic

51 Kg [8].

Although both Luo et al.’s experimental scheme and their obtained results are excellent and impressive, here we
have a supplement to their results, since our evaluation shows that the photon eﬀective rest mass due to the self-
induced charge currents [12,13] in the environmental dilute plasma (e.g., the muon (µ) component and alpha-particles
in the secondary cosmic ray ﬂux) is just the same order of magnitude [14] as Luo’s obtained upper limit on photon
mass.

In addition, it is worthwhile to point out that there are two main classes of experiments to detect photon rest mass
based on the Amp`ere-Maxwell-Proca equation and the Lagrangian (or Hamiltonian) density of electromagnetically
interacting system, respectively. The torsion balance experiments [9,11] considered here fall into the latter class (i.e.,
based on the electromagnetic Lagrangian and Hamiltonian density).

In what follows we will discuss these two problems.
We consider the potential eﬀects of self-induced charge currents arising in the torsion balance experiments [9,11].

It follows from (2) that the total eﬀective rest mass squared of electromagnetic ﬁelds in ions plasma is given as

It is known that at the sea level, the current density of muon component in secondary cosmic rays is about
1 [15]. Assuming that the muon velocity approaches the speed of light, the volume density of muon

with mµ denoting the muon mass, electromagnetic wave with wavelength λ ≫ 100 m [14] at the sea level acquires
53 Kg. Hence, likewise, in the rotating torsion balance experiment the ambient
an eﬀective rest mass about 0.3 × 10−
cosmic magnetic vector potentials (interstellar magnetic ﬁelds) with low or zero frequencies may also acquire such
eﬀective rest mass.

Note that the above-mentioned muon volume density (0.3 × 10−

3) is the datum obtained only at the sea level.
In order to evaluate the muon volume density in the environment where Luo’s experiment was performed, readers may
be referred to the following handbook data of muon current density in underground cosmic rays: the muon current
1 at the equivalent water depths of 100 m and 1000
densities are respectively 10−
m under the ground [15]. Since in Luo’s experiment the total apparatus is located in a cave laboratory, on which
the least thickness of the cover is more than 40 m [11], it is reasonably believed that the muon density of secondary
cosmic rays in the vacuum chamber of Luo’s experiment may be one or two orders of magnitude less than that at the
sea level. This, therefore, means that by using the formula (4) the eﬀective rest mass acquired by photons in Luo’s
vacuum chamber may be about (0.3 ∼ 1) × 10−

54 Kg which can be compared to Luo’s result (1.2 × 10−

1 and 10−

54 Kg).

It is believed that the air molecules in the low-pressure vacuum chamber of torsion balance experiment cannot be
easily ionized by the alpha-particles, electrons and protons of cosmic rays, because, for example, it is readily veriﬁed
1 in the dilute air with the pressure being only
that the mean free path of alpha-particle moving at about 107m · s−
2 Pa [11] is too large (i.e., more than 106 m) [14] for the dilute air molecules to be ionized. So, the air medium
10−
in the low-pressure vacuum chamber has nothing to contribute to the eﬀective rest mass of photons. However, as far
as the alpha-particle, π mesons, electrons etc. in secondary cosmic rays are concerned, these ions will also contribute
54 Kg to photon rest mass, since, for instance, the volume density of alpha-particles and other ions at the
about 10−
sea level in secondary cosmic rays is about one order of magnitude less than that of muons [15].

Thus the photon eﬀective rest mass resulting from both muons and other ions in secondary cosmic rays can be
54 Kg) by Luo et al. in their recent rotating torsion balance
compared to the newly obtained upper limit (1.2 × 10−
experiment [11]. For this reason, Luo’s experimental upper limit on photon mass is said to be just a critical value.
It is reasonably believed that Luo’s recent experimental result is of physical interest. However, the photon mass
problem still deserves further experimental investigation so as to improve the present upper limit on photon mass. It
is claimed that, in the near future, only the contribution of ions in environmental dilute plasma, i.e., the secondary

cosmic rays is ruled out, can we deal better with the experimental schemes, which can place severe limit on the
photon rest (intrinsic) mass and other related experimental results. In addition, it is apparently seen that not only
the photon intrinsic rest mass but also the eﬀective mass due to media dispersion will play important roles in both
fundamental and applied physics. For example, taking into account the inﬂuence of the media dispersion and the
consequent photon eﬀective mass on the geometric phases of photons propagating inside a noncoplanarly curved ﬁber
[16] is physically interesting, which is under consideration and would be published elsewhere.

Additionally, the diﬀerence between the two categories of µ2

eﬀ based on diﬀerent physical mechanisms should be
pointed out: the theoretical mechanism of torsion balance experiment lies in the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian (2) of
eﬀ = 2 µ0N e2
interacting electromagnetic system, so, the eﬀective rest mass squared of electromagnetic ﬁelds is µ2
m .
However, for those experimental schemes [1,7,8] of photon rest mass stemming from the Amp`ere-Maxwell-Proca

two µ2

Thus the eﬀective rest mass squared of electromagnetic ﬁelds in the experiments based on the Amp`ere-Maxwell-Proca
equation (5) is µ2
m . The so-called experimental realizations stemming from the
Amp`ere-Maxwell-Proca equation are as follows: pulsar test of a variation of the speed of light with frequency [1];
geomagnetic limit on photon mass based on the analysis of satellite measurements of the Earth’s ﬁeld [8]; experimental
test of Amp`ere’s law at low temperature [7], etc.. In all these experimental schemes, the eﬀective mass squared is
eﬀ = µ0N e2
µ2
m .
It is shown that in the rotating torsion balance experiments the extra torque 2 µ0N e2

m ad × A produced by the inter-
action of magnetic dipole vector potential moment ad with the ambient cosmic magnetic vector potential will also acts
upon the toroid in the torsion balance experiments [9,11] whose apparatus is immersed in the dilute plasma such as
eﬀ = µ0N e2
the cosmic rays and radon gas. Here the photon eﬀective rest mass squared is µ2

as stated above.

We study linear guided waves propagating in a slab waveguide made of a negative-refraction-
index material, the so-called left-handed waveguide. We reveal that the guided waves in left-handed
waveguides possess a number of peculiar properties, such as the absence of the fundamental modes,
mode double degeneracy, and sign-varying energy ﬂux. In particular, we predict the existence of
novel types of guided waves with a dipole-vortex structure of the Pointing vector.

Recent experimental demonstration of novel compos-
ite materials with a negative index of refraction [1] opens
up a unique opportunity to design novel types of de-
vices where electromagnetic waves are governed in a non-
conventional way. The history of these materials begins
with the paper by Veselago [2], who studied the wave
propagation in a hypothetical material with simultane-
ously negative dielectric permittivity ǫ and magnetic per-
meability µ. Such media are usually termed left-handed
materials, since the electric and magnetic ﬁelds form a
left set of vectors with the wave vector. Already back in
1968, Veselago predicted a number of remarkable prop-
erties of waves in left-handed materials, such as negative
refraction, reversed Doppler and Vavilov-Cherenkov ef-
fects. However, structures with both negative ǫ and µ
have not been known until recently, although materials
with negative dielectric permittivity are known (e.g. a
metal below the plasma frequency).

The study of microstructured metallic materials for
magnetic resonance imaging [3] has shown that such
structures can be described in terms of eﬀective mag-
netic permeability which becomes negative in the vicin-
ity of a resonance frequency. It was expected that mixing
the composite materials with negative magnetic perme-
ability [3] with those possessing negative dielectric per-
mittivity [4] would allow to create a novel type of meta-
materials with a negative index of refraction.
Indeed,
both numerical simulations [5] and experimental results
[1, 6] conﬁrmed that such left-handed (or negative-index
refraction) materials can be fabricated and analyzed.

One of the ﬁrst applications of the negative-refraction
materials was suggested by Pendry [7], who demon-
strated that a slab of a lossless negative-refraction ma-
terial can provide a perfect image of a point source. Al-
though the perfect image is a result of an ideal theoreti-
cal model used in Ref. [7], the resolution limit was shown
to be independent on the wavelength of electromagnetic
waves (but can be determined by other factors such as
loss, spatial dispersion, etc.), and it can be better than
the resolution of a conventional lens [8].

The improved resolution of a slab of the negative-
refraction material can be explained by the excitation
of surface waves at both interfaces of the slab. There-
fore, it is important to study the properties of surface

waves at the interfaces between the negative-refraction
and conventional materials. So far, the frequency disper-
sion of surface waves at a single interface and in a slab
waveguide was calculated numerically only for particular
medium parameters [9].

In this Letter, we study, for the ﬁrst time to our knowl-
edge, the structure and basic properties of electromag-
netic waves guided by a left-handed waveguide. In order
to emphasize the unusual and somewhat exotic properties
of such waves, we compare them with the guided waves
of conventional planar dielectric waveguides. We reveal
that the guided modes in left-handed waveguides diﬀer
dramatically from conventional guided waves, and they
possess a number of unusual properties, including the
absence of the fundamental modes, double degeneracy of
the modes, the sign-varying energy ﬂux, etc. In partic-
ular, we predict the existence of novel types of guided
waves with a dipole-vortex structure of the energy ﬂux
and the corresponding Pointing vector.

We consider a symmetric slab waveguide in a conven-
tional planar geometry [see, e.g., the top left insert in
Fig. 1(a)]. In the general case, a slab of the thickness 2L
is made of a material with dielectric permittivity ǫ2 and
magnetic permeability µ2, which both can be negative
or positive. We assume that the surrounding medium is
right-handed, and is therefore characterized by both pos-
itive ǫ1 and µ1. It is well known that a slab waveguide
made of a conventional (right-handed) dielectric material
with ǫ2 > 0 and µ2 > 0 creates a non-leaky waveguide
for electromagnetic waves, provided the refractive index
of a slab is higher than that of the surrounding dielectric
medium (cladding), i.e. ǫ2µ2 > ǫ1µ1. However, in the
following we demonstrate that this simple criterion can
not be applied to the waveguides made of a left-handed
material.

To be speciﬁc, below we describe the properties of the
TE guided modes in which the electric ﬁeld ~E is polarized
along the y axis. A similar analysis can be carried out
for the TM modes, and these results will be presented
elsewhere. From the Maxwell’s equations, it follows that
stationary TE modes can be described by the following

In Figs. 1(a,b), we draw three dashed lines corresponding
to diﬀerent slab waveguides, having the same ratio µ1/µ2.
The intersections of a dashed line with solid curves indi-
cate the existence of various guided modes. We present
results for a conventional (right-handed) waveguide in
Fig. 1(a), in order to compare them directly with the cor-
responding dependencies for a left-handed slab waveguide
in Fig. 1(b).

First of all, the analysis of Eqs. (4) and (5) conﬁrms
the well-known textbook results that a right-handed slab
waveguide can only support “fast” guided modes, which
exist when the waveguide core has a higher refractive in-
dex than its cladding, i.e. for ǫ2 µ2 > ǫ1 µ1. In this case,
there always exists a fundamental guided mode, which
proﬁle does not contain zeros. The conventional waveg-
uide can also support higher-order modes, their number
is limited by the value 2ρ1/2/π. These various regimes
are illustrated in Fig. 1(a) with diﬀerent dashed lines.

However, we ﬁnd that the properties of the left-handed
slab waveguides are highly nontrivial. First, such waveg-
uides can support “slow” modes, and they are either sym-
metric (node-less) or antisymmetric (one zero). Such so-
lutions represent in-phase or out-of-phase bound states
of surface modes, localized at the two interfaces between
In the conventional case of both
right and left media.

positive ǫ and µ, such surface waves do not exist, however
they appear when the magnetic permeability changes its
sign (for the TE polarization). Thus, the guided modes
can be supported by both low-index and high-index left-
handed slab waveguides.

Second, the conventional hierarchy of “fast” modes
is removed. Speciﬁcally, (i) the fundamental node-less
mode does not exist at all, (ii) the ﬁrst-order mode ex-
ists only in a particular range of the parameter values
ρ, and it always disappears in wide waveguides, when ρ
exceeds a critical value, and (iii) two modes having the
same number of nodes can co-exist in the same waveg-
uide. We illustrate some of these nontrivial features in
Fig. 1(b).

Frequency dispersion of the guided waves in the left-
handed waveguides should be studied by taking into ac-
count the dispersion of both ǫ2 and µ2, since this is an
essential property of such materials [2]. We follow Ref. [6]
and consider the following frequency dependencies of the
eﬀective left-handed medium characteristics,

where the parameters correspond to the experimental
data of Ref. [6]: ωp = 10 GHz, ω0 = 4 GHz, and
F = 0.56. The region of simultaneously negative permit-
tivity and permeability in this case ranges from 4 GHz
to 6 GHz. Dispersion curves for the ﬁrst three guided
modes in a slab waveguide with the thickness parameter
L = 2 cm are shown in Fig. 2, where dashed curves cor-
respond to “fast” modes, and solid – to “slow” modes.
We ﬁnd that the fundamental “slow” mode exists only at

3

higher frequencies, whereas the second-order fast mode
appears at lower frequencies. Both modes can have ei-
ther positive or negative group-velocity dispersion in dif-
ferent parameter regions. Properties of the ﬁrst-order
antisymmetric mode are diﬀerent. The type of this mode
seamlessly changes from “fast” to “slow” as the frequency
grows. This transition occurs when the condition k2 = 0
is satisﬁed, which is a boundary separating the two types
of modes, as shown in Fig. 2 by a dotted line. The high
“fast” modes exists at the frequencies close to the reso-
nance at ω = 4GHz.

In the left-handed materials, the electromagnetic waves
are backward, since the energy ﬂux and wave vector have
opposite directions [2], whereas these vectors are paral-
lel in conventional (right-handed) homogeneous materi-
als. The energy ﬂux is characterized by the Pointing vec-
tor averaged over the period T = 2π/ω and deﬁned as
H∗]. A monochromatic guided mode
S = (c/8π) Re [E
has, by deﬁnition, a stationary transverse proﬁle, and
the averaged energy ﬂux is directed along the waveguide
only. It follows from the Maxwell’s equations and Eq. (2)
that the z-component of the energy ﬂux is,

The total power ﬂux through the waveguide core and

distribution for the waves guided along the left-handed
slab is rather unusual.
Indeed, the energy ﬂux inside
the slab (with µ < 0) is opposite to that in the sur-
rounding medium (with µ > 0). This occurs because
the normalized wave vector component along the waveg-
uide (h) is ﬁxed in a guided mode according to Eq. (2).
An important information about the guided modes can
be extracted from the study of the normalized energy

We have performed a detailed analysis of the slow

guided modes and identiﬁed four distinct cases.

(i) ǫ2µ2 > ǫ1µ1, µ2 > µ1. Only odd mode exists below
the threshold, ρ < µ2

value of the slab thickness L below which the odd mode
exists is found as

The energy ﬂux P is positive for all values of L. The
modes are forward propagating, i.e. the total energy ﬂux
along the waveguide is co-directed with the wavevector.
(ii) ǫ2µ2 > ǫ1µ1, µ2 < µ1. Even mode exists at all
values of ρ, however odd modes can appear only when
1/µ2
a threshold parameter value is exceeded, ρ > µ2
2.
Accordingly, the critical value (9) determines the lower

4

emitters positioned at the opposite ends of the waveg-
uide. Therefore, it is of the fundamental importance to
understand whether wave packets of ﬁnite temporal and
spatial extension can exist in left-handed waveguides. We
calculate the Pointing vector averaged over the period
of the carrier frequency, and present the characteristic
structure of the energy ﬂow in Fig. 4. Due to the unique
double-vortex structure of the energy ﬂow, most of the
energy remains inside the wavepacket, and it does not
disintegrate. The group velocity is proportional to the
total energy ﬂux P , and it can therefore be made very
small or even zero by a proper choice of the waveguide
parameters as demonstrated above. On the other hand,
the group-velocity dispersion, which determines the rate
of pulse broadening, can also be controlled. This ﬂexibil-
ity seems very promising for potential applications.

Finally, we note that recent numerical simulations
demonstrated that the phenomenon of the negative re-
fraction, similar to that found for the left-handed meta-
materials, can be observed in photonic crystals [8, 11].
Although in this case the wavelength is of the same or-
der as the period of the dielectric structure (and, there-
fore, a simple analysis in terms of the eﬀective medium
approximation is not strictly justiﬁed), we expect that
similar mechanisms of wave localization will remain gen-
erally valid.

In conclusion, we have described, for the ﬁrst time to
our knowledge, linear guided waves in left-handed slab
waveguides. We have demonstrated a number of exotic
properties of such waves, including the absence of funda-
mental modes and the sign-varying energy ﬂux, and we
have predicted the existence of the fundamentally novel
classes of guided waves with a vortex-type internal struc-
ture.

boundary of the existence region for odd modes. The to-
tal energy ﬂux is negative for all L, and the modes are
backward. The energy is mostly localized inside the slab.
(iii) ǫ2µ2 < ǫ1µ1, µ2 > µ1. Both odd and even modes
exist at all values of ρ and L, and the modes are forward.
(iv) ǫ2µ2 < ǫ1µ1, µ2 < µ1. Only even modes exist
below the threshold value of ρ which can be found nu-
merically using Eq. (5). Characteristic dependences of
the wavenumber and normalized power on the slab width
is shown in Figs. 3(a,b). At any slab thickness below a
critical value, two modes always co-exist. One of the
modes is forward and weakly localized, but the other one
is backward and more conﬁned. When the slab width ap-
proaches the critical value, the branches corresponding to
diﬀerent modes merge, and the energy ﬂux vanishes. In
this special case, the energy ﬂuxes inside and outside the
slab exactly compensate each other.

Since the energy ﬂuxes are oppositely directed inside
the guided modes, it might initially seem that such waves
can only be sustained by two continuously operating

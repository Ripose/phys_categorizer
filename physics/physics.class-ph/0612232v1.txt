Abstract

The complete charge-current density and ﬁeld strength of an arbitrarily
accelerated relativistic point-charge are explicitly calculated. The current
density includes, apart from the well-established delta-function term which
is sufﬁcient for its global conservation, additional contributions depending
on the second and third proper-time derivatives of the position, which are
necessary for its local conservation as required by the internal consistency of
classical electrodynamics. Similarly, the ﬁeld strength includes an additional
delta-like contribution which is necessary for obtaining this result.

The four-potential from which this ﬁeld and the conserved charge-current
density derive is found to be unique in the sense that it is the only one reducing
to an invariant scalar function in the instantaneous rest frame of the point-
charge that leads to a point-like conserved charge-current density.

Introduction

Local conservation of the charge-current density 4-vector Jµ is a necessary con-
sequence of the antisymmetry of the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength tensor Fµν.
Indeed, the statement

derives from taking the 4-divergence of both sides of Maxwell’s inhomogeneous
equation

(1.1)

(1.2)

∂µJµ = 0,

∂νFµν = −4πJµ,

1

where the left-hand side vanishes after contraction because Fµν is antisymmetric.
This conclusion is absolutely general and should therefore be true for an arbi-
trarily moving relativistic point-charge, that is for the charge-current density of
the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld, which turns out not to be the case for the customary
formulation of this ﬁeld.

In this paper we show that if the Li´enard-Wiechert current is properly calcu-
lated, which implies that the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld strength must be supplemented
by an additional δ-function-like ﬁeld, local charge conservation is restored. This
conclusion is obtained by using only well known physical concepts, and a few
basic results of distribution theory, but at the expense of some lengthy calculations
whose details could not be given in the letter: The locally-conserved current of
the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld, Ref. [1].

For ease of calculation we use the biquaternion formalism. While this choice
is a matter of convenience for the present paper, it is a necessity for subsequent
publications because the spinor decomposition of four-vectors enables complicated
four-dimensional integrations to be made very efﬁciently and in full generality.

The general structure of this paper is the same as the letter [1], in which the
tensor formalism was used throughout. Thus we begin in Sec. 2 by giving our
notations and deﬁnitions, including a number of basic quaternion deﬁnitions to
make our paper self-contained. A number of four-dimensional geometrical and
kinematical identities needed in this and subsequent papers are derived, or else
sufﬁcient information is given to explain how they were derived.

In Sec. 3 we recall the customary formulation of the Li´enard-Wiechert potential
and ﬁeld, and show that the corresponding charge-current density is not conserved.
This requires calculations that are repeated in more details in the following sections,
where it is also explained why the standard formulation does not lead to a conserved
current.

The locally conserved charge-current density is derived in Sec. 4. The method
used consists of postulating a very general form for the four-potential, expressed in
the causal coordinate system deﬁned in Sec. 2, and to seek under which conditions
it leads to a conserved point-like charge-current density. This current density, i.e.,

has a rather complicated structure: Kinematically, it depends on the three invariants
ξ, κ, and χ, as well as on the two 4-vectors ˙Zµ and ¨Zµ, and on the biacceleration
...
Z µ through the invariant χ; geometrically, on the angular variables through the
null 4-vector Kµ(θ, φ); and, distributionally, on Dirac’s δ-function and its ﬁrst two

2

derivatives.

In Sec. 5 a straightforward derivation of the conserved charge-current density
is given. This mathematically rigorous derivation is based on a full exploitation of
Schwarz’s structure theorem of distribution theory, which explains how δ-functions
arise as partial derivatives of continuous functions [2, 3]. It will be seen that all
is needed is a correct characterization of the nature of the singularity associated
with a classical electron (namely a point-particle whose four-potential reduces to
an invariant scalar function in its instantaneous rest frame), and everything follows
from a consistent application of Maxwell’s theory. This characterization consists
of replacing the Li´enard-Wiechert potential by the expression

Aµ = e

Υ(ξ)

,

˙Zµ

(cid:12)
τ =τr
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(5.2)

where the generalized function Υ(ξ) explicitly speciﬁes how to consistently dif-
ferentiate at ξ = 0. A similar form of the potential of a classical point-charge
has been discovered independently by F.R. Tangherlini in the context of general
relativity [4], which is why we propose to refer to Eq. (5.2) as “Tangherlini’s
potential.”

In the conclusion, Sec. 6, we discuss the consistency of our main results,
Eqs. (4.23) and (5.2), with the standard formulations of Coulomb’s potential,
Lagrange’s function, and Green’s function of classical electrodynamics. Finally,
we summarize these results in the form of a theorem, stating that Tangherlini’s
potential is unique in the sense that it is the only four-potential reducing to an
invariant scalar function in the instantaneous rest frame that leads to a point-like
conserved charge-current density.

2 Notations and deﬁnitions

In this and related papers Hamilton’s biquaternion (i.e., complexiﬁed quaternion)
formalism is used instead of ordinary vector or tensor calculus. This is because
biquaternions provide concise and fully-general explicit expressions for all covari-
ant quantities appearing in electrodynamics, including spinor and null quantities
for which there are no explicit formula in ordinary vector or tensor calculus, e.g.,
Eqs. (2.12) and (2.13) below.

A primer of quaternion methods in physics is given in Ref. [5]. However, as
a quick start, we recall that the non-commutative algebra of quaternions consists
of 4-dimensional objects Q = s + ~v, were s and ~v are the scalar and respectively

3

vector parts of Q. The quaternion product is deﬁned as

(a + ~a)(b + ~b) := ab − ~a · ~b + a~b + b~a + ~a × ~b,

(2.1)

but detailed calculations requiring this formula are rarely needed since the crucial
advantage of quaternions is that they can be manipulated as whole symbols, there-
fore dispensing of complicated calculations at the component level, as in tensor
and vector calculus. This is particularly useful in relativity and electrodynamics
where the Minkowski metric is obtained by allowing quaternion components to be
complex numbers. (Hamilton introduced the preﬁx “bi-” to denoted complexiﬁed
objects, e.g., biquaternion, bivector, biscalar for complex number, etc.)

For example, the 4-gradient (i.e., the 4-dimensional generalization of Hamil-
ton’s “nabla”) and the 4-vector current-density in Eq. (1.1) correspond to the
biquaternions

∇ =

+ ~∇,

and

J = ρ − i~j.

∂
∂it

(We use Gaussian units and put the velocity of light in the vacuum equal to one.)
Eq. (1.1) then becomes

∇ ◦ J = 0,

where the unary operator ( ) denotes quaternion conjugation, namely the operation
(s + ~v) = s−~v, and the binary operator ◦ as in Q◦R means taking the scalar part of
the product QR. As is shown in Ref. [5], for example, products such as QRST ...,
where 4-vectors and their conjugate alternate, are automatically covariant. For
example, ∇ ◦ J is an invariant scalar. Moreover, for any 4-vector Q, the product
QQ = QQ is an invariant scalar: The square of its Minkowski norm.

The electromagnetic ﬁeld strength corresponds to the bivector ~F = ~E + i ~B,

and Maxwell’s equation (1.2) translates to

By operating with ∇ on both sides, this equation leads to

∇ ~F = −4πJ.

∇∇ ~F = −4π∇J,

where ∇∇ is a scalar operator: The d’Alambertian. Therefore, since ~F is a vector,
and because operating with a scalar operator on a vector can only lead to a vector,
taking the scalar part on both sides automatically leads to Eq. (2.3). Consequently,
in biquaternion formalism the necessity of the local conservation of J is even more
transparent than in tensor formalism: It is immediately seen that this conservation
is a consequence of the formal structure of electrodynamics, and for this reason
much more fundamental than, for example, gauge invariance [6, p.676]).

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

Finally, to end this brief introduction to quaternion methods, we give the

deﬁnition of ~F in terms of the 4-potential A = V − i ~A, i.e.,

~F := ∇ ∧ A,

(2.6)

where the the binary operator ∧ as in Q ∧ R means taking the vector part of the
product QR.

2.1 Paul Weiss’s causal coordinate system

The most important covariant null-quantity of ﬁeld theory is, in tensor notation,
the four-vector interval Rµ = Xµ − Zµ between the position Zµ of moving particle
and the point Xµ at which the ﬁelds associated with the particle are observed.
Indeed, the nullity of the Minkowskian distance

RµRµ = |~x − ~z|2 − (tx − tz)2 = 0,

(2.7)

means that the points X and Z are positioned in such a way that a ﬁeld observed
at X can be causally related to its source at Z, and vice-versa that a particle at Z
can be causally inﬂuenced by the ﬁeld generated by another particle at X. In the
ﬁrst case causality is implied by the condition that the time tz is preceding tx, i.e.,

tz < tx.

(2.8)

The corresponding root tz of Eq. (2.7) is then customarily called the “retarded
time,” although “causal time” would be a better word to suggest that it is the time
tz at which the source located at ~z has produced the effect that is later observed at
the location ~x at the time tx.

In biquaternion notation the observer’s 4-vector is written X = itx + ~x and

that of the source Z = itz + ~z. Eq. (2.1) is then written

RR = 0,

where

R = X − Z.

(2.9)

If the world-line of the source is expressed in parametric form as a function Z(τ )
1 − β2 is the Lorentz factor and
of the proper time τ = γtz, where γ = 1/
~β = ~v/c the 3-dimensional velocity, its 4-velocity ˙Z is given by the equation

p

˙Z(τ ) = γ(1 − i~β),

such that

˙Z ˙Z = 1,

(2.10)

where the dot corresponds to differentiation with respect to the imaginary proper
time , i.e.,

(2.11)

˙( ) =

d
diτ

( ).

5

Because biquaternions form an algebra, the 4-velocity has a unique decomposition
as a product

˙Z(τ ) = BB+,

such that

(2.12)
where the operator ( )+ denotes quaternion biconjugation, namely the operation
= s∗ − ~v∗ which combines quaternion and complex con-
(s + ~v)+ = (s + ~v)
jugations. Eq. (2.12) is the spinor decomposition of the 4-velocity, and the unit
biquaternion B(τ ) biunivocally deﬁnes the general Lorentz-boost to the frame in
which the arbitrarily moving particle at the point Z is instantaneously at rest.

BB = 1,

∗

In biquaternions the covariant form of the causal relation between an observer
point X = itx + ~x and a source point Z = itz + ~z is expressed by the spinor
decomposition of the interval X − Z, discovered in 1941 by Paul Weiss [7], i.e.,

R = X − Z = ξB(i + ~ν)B+,

such that

RR = 0.

(2.13)

Here ξ is an invariant scalar and ~ν = ~ν(θ, φ) a unit vector so that i + ~ν, and conse-
quently R, are null biquaternions. Eq. (2.13) is therefore an explicit parametriza-
tion of R in terms of four variables: The invariants ξ and τ , and the two angles
θ and φ characterizing the unit vector ~ν in the instantaneous rest frame of the
particle. Thus, in that frame, i.e., when B = 1, the interval X − Z reduces to the
quaternion ξ(i + ~ν), which shows that in that frame the vector ξ~ν corresponds to
the ordinary radius vector ~x − ~z, and that the distance ξ appears to an observer
at rest in that frame as the ordinary distance |~x − ~z|. On the other hand, when
B 6= 1, Eq. (2.13) provides a general parametrization of the null-interval R, that
is, in geometrical language, of the “light-” or null-cone originating from Z. In the
case where ξ, ~ν(θ, φ), and B(τ ) are evaluated at the retarded proper time τr = γtz,
where tz corresponds to the causality condition (2.8), this parametrization deﬁnes a
causal coordinate system erected at the 4-position Z. Paul Weiss called it “retarded
coordinate system” [7], but we prefer the term causal coordinate system.

From the form of Eqs. (2.12) and (2.13) it is immediately seen that ξ can be

expressed in terms of R and ˙Z, namely as the scalar product

iξ(τ ) = ˙Z ◦ R,

(2.14)

which evaluated at τ = τr is the usual deﬁnition of the retarded distance ξ.

Because the explicit form of R as given by Eq. (2.13) will no more be directly
used in the present paper, we can introduce the “unit” null-quaternion K such that

K(θ, φ) := R/ξ,

(2.15)

which will be extensively used in the sequel.

2.2 Kinematical invariants

In this paper we shall have to calculate expressions containing up to the fourth
proper time derivative of Z. This implies that apart from ξ there will be three more
invariants, namely the acceleration, biacceleration, and triacceleration invariants
deﬁned as:

We shall also use a number of well-known kinematical identities which are
easily derived by iteratively derivating Eq. (2.10), and which yield the invariants:

κ(τ ) := ¨Z ◦ K,
...
iχ(τ ) :=
Z ◦ K,
....
Z ◦ K.

ζ(τ ) :=

˙Z◦ ˙Z = ˙Z ˙Z = 1,
¨Z◦ ˙Z = 0,
...
Z◦ ˙Z = − ¨Z ¨Z = −A2,
....
...
Z ◦ ˙Z = −3

Z,

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

where the invariant A is the magnitude of the acceleration.

2.3 Causal derivatives

When differentiating quantities depending on X and Z with respect to the coor-
dinates of the point of observation X, one has to include the partial derivatives
relative to both X and Z since they are related by the condition RR = 0, which
insures causality. Because Z = Z(τ ) is an implicit function of τ this can be done
by a simple rule obtained by differentiating Eq. (2.9), i.e.,

2(dX − dZ) ◦ R = 2(dX − diτ ˙Z) ◦ R = 0.

(2.23)

Thus,

R
˙Z ◦ R
where we used Eq. (2.14) and the deﬁnition of K. But, by deﬁnition of the total
derivative,

= −idX ◦ K,

diτ = dX ◦

(2.24)

diτ = dX ◦ ∇iτ,

(2.25)

7

where ∇ = ∂it + ~∇ is the 4-gradient operator. Therefore, comparing Eqs. (2.24)
and (2.25), we ﬁnd

∇iτ = −iK.

Consequently, for an expression E = E(X, τ ), where the argument X corresponds
to an explicit dependence on X, and τ to the proper time, we have the differentiation
rule

∇E(X, τ ) = ∇E(X) − iK ˙E(τ )

where the condition τ = τr recalls that all quantities on its left are evaluated at
the retarded proper time τr. In the sequel, for simplicity, this condition will be
speciﬁed explicitly only for the main equations.

We now use Eq. (2.27) to derive a number of simple relations which will be
useful for calculating more complicated expressions in the sequel. The ﬁrst one is

.

τ =τr

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

∇R = 4 + iK ˙Z.

where we used ∇X = 4 which is evident. Further we have

N := ∇ξ = (1 − κξ)K − i ˙Z,

which deﬁnes the normal N to the proper tube of radius ξ surrounding the world-
line, and which has the properties

Using the same method, i.e., the differentiation rule of Eq. (2.27) and the

previously obtained results, we also ﬁnd

which show how 4-gradients of biquaternion expressions can lead to results that
are just scalars.

Similarly to Eq. (2.29), we have the 4-gradients

N ◦ N = 1 − 2κξ,
N ◦ ˙Z = − iκξ,
N ◦ ¨Z = κ(1 − κξ),
N ◦

...
Z = iA2 + i(1 − κξ)χ.

The second of these involves a fourth proper-time derivative because ζ =
Z ◦ K,
i.e., Eq. (2.18). Accordingly, if we calculate the d’Alambertian of κξ, i.e., the
gradient of Eq. (2.36) we expect such a fourth derivative to arise. However,

∇∇κξ = 4χ.

The reason for this is that when calculating the gradient of the second term in
Eq. (2.36) we get

∇χξK =

−i

...
Z − (A2 + ζ)K

(cid:0)

K + χξ∇K,
(cid:1)

so that the term containing ζ disappears because KK = 0. As will be seen, this
is a general feature: Causality insures that no derivatives of Z beyond the third
appear in any physically meaningful quantity considered in this paper.

(2.38)

(2.39)

3 The customary formulation

The potential of the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld can be obtained by a number of methods
that are explained in many text books, e.g., [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Most frequently it
is obtained by working in the Lorenz gauge, and by means of a Green’s function
assuming that the point-charge can be represented by a 3-dimensional δ-function.
In biquaternion notation this source current-density can be written in the following
form

J S =

e

ξ2 δ(ξ),

whose normalization corresponds to the global (or integral) form of charge con-
servation, i.e.,

The resulting potential has the remarkable simple form

from which, one can calculate the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength bivector ~F =
~E + i ~B according to its deﬁnition Eq. (2.6), which we rewrite in equivalent for as

~F = ∇ ∧ A = ∇A − ∇ ◦ A = ∇A − ψ,

where the scalar

Applying the rule (2.27) and using Eq. (2.29) it is easily found that

(3.7)

which shows that the Lorenz gauge, i.e., ψ = 0, is only satisﬁed when ξ 6= 0.
However, since the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength is a vector, the fact that ψLW is
undeﬁned at ξ = 0 has no direct consequence on the ﬁeld, even though the ﬁeld
~F LW is derived from the same potential ALW , which just like ~F LW is undeﬁned
at ξ = 0. Thus, taking the vector part of (3.6) we have for the Li´enard-Wiechert

Using again the rule (2.27) we can calculate the corresponding charge current
density according to Eq. (2.4). However, since ψLW = 0 for ξ 6= 0, it is easier to
use Eq. (3.4) and rewrite (2.4) as

(3.8)

(3.9)

J LW = −

which, in fact, is the standard form used in the customary formulation assuming
the Lorenz gauge. Then using for ∇ALW equation (3.6), we get after some

(3.10)

In deriving this result we have been careful not to subtract potentially inﬁnite
quantities in order to see how δ-functions, such as in the current density (3.1),
arise. Indeed, when ξ 6= 0 the current (3.10) is zero, but since it is undeﬁned for
ξ = 0 one has to substitute an appropriate δ-function for the ill-deﬁned differences
1/ξn − 1/ξn. The standard prescription for doing this is to use global charge
conservation, i.e., Eq. (3.2), which implies that the expression 2/ξ3 − 2/ξ3 should
be replaced by −δ(ξ)/ξ2. But there is no such constraint for the 1/ξ2 − 1/ξ2
expression. However, if its origin is traced to the 1/ξ factor in the potential, one

10

ﬁnds that it should be +δ(ξ)/ξ to be consistent with the 2/ξ3 − 2/ξ3 expression.
With this prescription we get

(3.11)

This current density differs from Eq. (3.1) by the presence of two additional terms
which depends on the acceleration. However, when integrated over the whole
3-space as in Eq. (3.2), J LW yields the same total current e ˙Z as J S, because
after multiplication by the volume element dφdθ ξ2dξ the acceleration dependent
terms does not contribute to the radial integral since ξδ(ξ) = 0. Unfortunately, if
one tries to verify that the charge-current density J LW is locally conserved, and
consistently uses again the rule (2.27) for the partial derivatives, one ﬁnds

∇ ◦ J LW = −

(3.12)

Moreover, if instead of J LW one tries to verify local conservation for J S deﬁned
in Eq. (3.1), one also ﬁnds that it is not locally conserved. Indeed, as this current is
very simple, this is immediately seen by calculating its divergence, which consists
of three terms, i.e., using Eqs. (2.27), (2.29), (2.16), and (2.31)

Only in the inertial limit, that is for non-accelerated motion, are the current
densities J LW and J S locally conserved. This means that something is wrong
in the customary formulation of the electrodynamics of an arbitrarily moving
point-charge, or else that something is inconsistent and needs to be clariﬁed. For
instance, to avoid any misunderstanding, it should be recalled that there is large
class of conditions under which a simple current density such Eq. (3.1) is locally
conserved. These comprise the case where instead of being related by a causality
condition such as Eq. (2.9), the X and Z variables are independent, e.g., [9, p. 72]
and [11, p. 139].

4 The locally conserved charge-current density

In this section we derive the locally conserved current of an arbitrarily moving
point-charge by making no other assumption than that its potential reduces to a

11

scalar function ϕ(ξ) in its instantaneous rest frame. Thus, instead of taking for the
potential the Li´enard-Wiechert form, i.e., Eq. (3.3), we will assume the general
form

A := e ˙Z(τ )ϕ(ξ)

,

(cid:12)
τ =τr
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(4.1)

and seek under which conditions it leads to a conserved point-like current density.

This method is motivated by the observation that any current distribution of

the general form

(cid:17)

S
ξ

+ T

(4.2)

δ(ξ),

J(X) =

e
4π (cid:16)

˙Z
ξ2 +
where S and T are any continuous 4-vector functions, will satisfy global charge
conservation because of the identity ξδ(ξ) = 0. We therefore suppose that the
origin of the absence of local current conservation could be due to an incorrect
handling of the singularity at ξ = 0, which should in fact lead to a current having
a more complicated form than Eqs. (3.1) or (3.11). Thus, to proceed step by step
and be fully general, we replace the 1/ξ factor in the potential (3.3) by a function
ϕ(ξ) in (4.1) that is ﬁnite and indeﬁnitely differentiable except possibly at ξ = 0.
This will lead us to a differential equation for a conserved current, of which we
can study the solutions in terms of both regular functions and distributions.

Moreover, in order to make gauge invariance explicit, we write Maxwell’s
equation for the current density J directly in terms of A, i.e., from Eq. (2.4) and
(2.6),

∇B − ∇ψ = −4πJ,

where

B := ∇A,

(4.3)

and ψ is the invariant already deﬁned in Eq. (3.5).

4.1 General ﬁeld-strength and gauge invariance

To ﬁnd the ﬁeld strength we ﬁrst calculate B, which using Eqs. (2.29) and (2.27),
is

B = ∇e ˙Zϕ = eN ˙Zϕ′ − eiK ¨Z

ϕ.

ξ

Using Eqs. (2.31) and (2.16), its scalar part is

where

ψ = −eiκξϕ1,

ϕ1 := ϕ′ +

1

ϕ.

12

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

The ﬁeld strength, Eq. (3.4), is then obtained by subtracting the scalar ψ from the
biquaternion B = ∇A, which is equivalent to taking its vector part, i.e.,

~F = ∇ ∧ A = eN ∧ ˙Zϕ′ − eiK ∧ ¨Z

ϕ,

(4.7)

1
ξ

which is gauge invariant. Indeed, by adding to A the 4-gradient of any scalar func-
tion f (X, Z) of the spatial coordinates and time, i.e., by making the substitution
A → A + ∇f , we see that B → B + ∇∇f while ψ → ψ + ∇∇f , so that ~F → ~F
and consequently neither ~F nor J depend on the choice of the gauge function f .

Moreover, as ψ has been subtracted from B = ∇A, the ﬁeld strength does not
depend on ψ nor on ϕ1, only on ϕ and ϕ′ separately, as can be seen in Eq. (4.7).

4.2 General charge-current density

To ﬁnd the general current density, deﬁned in Eq. (4.3), we begin by calculating
∇B, what is simpler to do if it is rewritten as ∇∇ ˙Zϕ. Thus,

∇B = e

place for the differentiations which are made within the ranges indicated by the
parentheses. The four terms in this expression are

the relation KK = 0 which enabled several simpliﬁcations. Combining these four
˙ZK + K ˙Z = 2 ˙Z ◦ K = 2i, we ﬁnd
terms, and noting that

∇B = −e2i ¨Zϕ1 + e(1 − 2κξ) ˙Zϕ2.

Here,

has been introduced as an expression distinct from ϕ1, even though it could be
expressed in terms of ϕ1 as ϕ2 = ϕ′
1 + ϕ1/ξ. This is because we want to avoid
any subtraction of potentially undeﬁned terms, and therefore keep everything
expressed in function of ϕ and its derivatives as they arise. Moreover, as seen in
Eq. (4.12), ϕ2 arises in the expression of the d’Alambertian of the scalar function
ϕ(ξ), which corresponds to the ﬁeld in spin-zero electrodynamics, and therefore
is of interest on its own.

We next calculate ∇ψ, which according to Eq. (4.5) is

∇ψ = −eiϕ1∇κξ − eiκξNϕ′
1.

(4.15)

Using Eqs. (2.29) and (2.36) it can be rewritten as

∇ψ = −ei( ¨Z + ξχK)ϕ1 − eiκξ

(1 − κξ)K − i ˙Z

(4.16)

(cid:0)

ϕ′
1,

(cid:1)

which shows that whereas ∇B given by Eq. (4.13) is function of ˙Z and ¨Z, ∇ψ,
...
and thus the current density J given by Eq. (4.13), is moreover function of
Z
through the invariant χ.

Finally, combining Eqs. (4.13) and (4.16) according to Eq. (4.3), the general

form of the charge-current density is

−4πJ = + e(1 − 2κξ) ˙Zϕ2
− ei( ¨Z − χξK)ϕ1
+ eiκξ

(1 − κξ)K − i ˙Z

(cid:0)

ϕ′
1.
(cid:1)

(4.17)

Comparing with Eq. (4.12), the ﬁrst line is seen to come from the d’Alambertian
of ϕ(ξ), which is also at the origin of ϕ2(ξ). On the other hand, the second and
third lines, as well as ϕ1(ξ), come from both ∇B and ∇ψ.

In the inertial limit,

˙Z = Cst., this current-density reduces to the simple

expression

− 4πJ = +e ˙Zϕ2,

(4.18)

which is just Eq. (3.1) when ϕ = 1/ξ. On the other hand, the Li´enard-Wiechert
current-density, Eq. (3.11), is obtained by ignoring the contributions coming from
ψ, that is by taking Eq. (4.13) equal to −4πJ and assuming ϕ = 1/ξ.

4.3 Divergence of general charge-current density

Since we have the general form of the charge-current density we can now explicitly
verify that ∇ ◦ J = 0, i.e., Eq. (1.1). Of course, we expect that to be true if there is

14

no algebraic error in our calculations. But it is nevertheless important to do it since
we want to make sure that nothing special arises in terms of handling ill-deﬁned
quantities, and also because we want to know under which precise conditions the
charge-current density is locally conserved.

However, since the calculation of ∇ ◦ J is tedious, and basically consists of
repetitively using the previously used methods and identities, we will just give the
result, which is

∇ ◦ J = + 2eiχξ

(cid:17)

(4.19)

As can be see, this expression contains only the three invariants ξ, κ, and χ.
There is therefore no dependence on the fourth proper-time derivative of Z(τ ),
despite that the initial expression, the potential Eq. (4.1), depends on the ﬁrst
derivative because iξ = K ◦ ˙Z. As seen at the end of Sec. 2, this is because
causality insures that no derivatives of Z beyond the third appear in any physically
meaningful quantity considered in this paper.

On the other hand, concerning ϕ(ξ), the condition of validity of Eq. (4.19) is, as
expected, that it is three times differentiable, provided ξ 6= 0. Hence, if we assume
such a function for ϕ(ξ), and calculate the expressions in the two big parentheses,
we ﬁnd that they are both zero, implying that the charge-current density is indeed
conserved for any ξ except possibly for ξ 6= 0. However, if ϕ(ξ) is a distribution
rather than a regular function, which means that the derivatives of ϕ(ξ) will be
deﬁned even at ξ = 0, the current density J will also be locally conserved, but the
condition ξ 6= 0 will no more be required.

Finally, in order to illustrate the importance of not having made any simpliﬁ-
cation before getting ∇ ◦ J in its ﬁnal form as in Eq. (4.19), we remark that the
ﬁrst line of this equation would not be there had we expressed ϕ2 in terms of ϕ1,
a possibility that was mentioned below Eq. (4.14).

4.4 Locally-conserved general charge-current density

We ﬁnally come to the Li´enard-Wiechert case, and therefore specialize to ϕ = 1/ξ.

For ξ 6= 0 we have then

∀ξ > 0,

ϕ1(ξ) = −

and ϕ2(ξ) = +

2
ξ3 −

2
ξ3 = 0,

(4.20)

1
ξ2 +

1
ξ2 = 0,

15

which imply that all terms in Eq. (4.17) are zero. The current density J is then
everywhere zero, except at ξ = 0 where it is undeﬁned. We therefore interpret
ϕ1(ξ) as a distribution, and use the theorem stating that a distribution which has its
support only in one point, say the origin, is a linear combination of the δ-function
and its derivatives up to a certain order [2, p.784]. Thus

∀ξ > 0,

ϕ1(ξ) =

δ(ξ),

(4.21)

1
ξ

which because of dimensionality comprises a single δ-function, and whose nor-
malization will turn out to be consistent with (3.2). Similarly, we also interpret
ϕ2(ξ) as a distribution, and, since it can be expressed in terms of ϕ1(ξ), we get

∀ξ > 0,

ϕ2(ξ) = ϕ′

1 +

ϕ1 = −

ξ2 δ(ξ).

(4.22)

Consequently, comparing with the discussion above Eq. (3.11), which demon-
strated the non-local-conservation of the customary charge-current density, we
have rigorously justiﬁed the prescription that lead to that equation.

As for the locally-conserved charge-current density Eq. (4.3), it remains to

substitute Eqs. (4.21) and (4.22) in Eq. (4.17), which gives ﬁnally

J =

.

(cid:12)
τ =τr
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

This result leads to several observations:

1. The current density J is much more complicated than the simple current
(3.1): It depends directly on the three invariants ξ, κ, and χ, as well as on
...
the two 4-vectors ˙Z and ¨Z; indirectly on the biacceleration
Z through the
invariant χ; and, ﬁnally, on the angular variables through the null 4-vector
K(θ, φ).

2. The dependence on the third derivative of Z is consistent with the Lorentz-
...
Dirac equation and with the Schott expression of the self-force, in which
Z
also appears, because the self-interaction force involves a product of J with
the self-ﬁeld.

3. Eq. (4.23) has the most general distributional form of Eq. (4.2), in accord

with the theorem cited above Eq. (4.21).

4. The current J and the invariant ψ depend on ϕ through ϕ1 in such a way

that if ψ(ξ) = 0, ∀ξ > 0, the current is zero. Thus, because

ψ = −eiκδ(ξ),

(4.24)

16

the gauge can be the Lorenz gauge ψ = 0 only for ξ 6= 0, when the
acceleration is non-zero, i.e., κ 6= 0.

5. The equation ϕ1(ξ) = ϕ′ + ϕ/ξ = 0, ∀ξ 6= 0, has only one solution: 1/ξ.
This singles out the corresponding potential as being the only one such
that the current density of a point-charge is conserved and thus given by
Eq. (4.23).

5 Straightforward derivation

While the previous section’s derivation of the locally-conserved current of an
arbitrarily moving point-charge is rigorous, it has one important shortcoming:
The derivation basically consisted of using distribution theory to ﬁnd the correct
form of that current, without having explicitly speciﬁed the form of the potential
and ﬁeld leading to it, even though we know from Sec. 3 that something is deﬁcient
in their customary formulation since they do not lead to the conserved current.
Indeed, what we expect from a consistent application of Maxwell’s theory is that
once we have properly formulated the potential or the ﬁeld, the current should
derive from either of them in a straightforward manner, that is without having to
“mend” some ill-deﬁned result to get the correct one.

In mathematical terms, this shortcoming consists of having just considered ϕ1
and ϕ2 as distributions, whereas according to Eqs. (4.6) and (4.14) they both derive
from ϕ which appears in the potential (4.1) already, and which therefore should
also be deﬁned in the context of distribution theory. In other words, we have not
looked at the origin of the δ-functions arising in ϕ1 and ϕ2, which by Schwarz’s
structure theorem of distribution theory must come from the differentiation of
some discontinuous function. In fact, the original discontinuity leading to these δ-
functions is easily found. This is because, in 3-dimensional notation, the retarded
distance Eq. (2.2) reads

ξ = |~x − ~z|γ(1 − ~ρ · ~β),

(5.1)

where ~ρ is the unit vector in the direction of ~x − ~z. The retarded distance is
therefore proportional to an absolute value, and for that reason has a discontinuous
derivative when ~x → ~z, i.e., at ξ = 0. Thus, when calculating derivatives of func-
tions expressed in the coordinate system {ξ, θ, φ}, one must carefully distinguish
between the coordinate ξ and the absolute value |ξ|, a crucial observation that was
ﬁrst made by Tangherlini [4, p.511–513].

Consequently, as is explained in details in Ref. [13], where a general method
to deal with singularities in spherical coordinates is given, the potential of an

17

(5.2)

(5.4)

arbitrarily moving accelerated point-charge must be written

where Υ(ξ) is the generalized function deﬁned as

and

which explicitly speciﬁes how to consistently differentiate at ξ = 0.



When the deﬁnition (2.6) and the causal differentiation rule (2.27) are now used
to calculate the ﬁeld strength starting from the potential (5.2), the corresponding
current density (2.4) is directly found to be the conserved one, i.e., Eq. (4.23).
However, instead of the customary Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld, Eq. (3.8), the ﬁeld
strength is now

which apart from the presence of the Υ-function multiplying ~F LW on the ﬁrst
line, has an additional δ-like contribution on the second. This is immediately seen
looking at the general form of ~F given by Eq. (4.7), in which according to the
potential (5.2) it sufﬁce to substitute

and

δ(ξ),

(5.5)

to obtain Eq. (5.4) after use of the identity N ∧ ˙Z = (1 − κξ)K ∧ ˙Z.

Since both the Υ-factor and the δ-like contribution in ~F are necessary to
obtain the current density satisfying the local conservation Eq. (1.1), it is clear that
the customary ~F LW cannot lead to such a current. In fact, it is by calculating the
current density immediately from the potential as in Eq. (4.3) — that is by ignoring
that the ﬁeld strength could be different from the customary one — that after many
unsuccessful attempts the author discovered the conserved current density.

Indeed, the δ-like ﬁeld on the second line of Eq. (5.4) is absolutely necessary
since it carries an essential part of the information about the nature of the singularity
at ξ = 0, which is not simply due to the divergence of 1/ξ when ξ → 0, as in the
customary formulation, but to that of 1/|ξ| where the absolute value leads to the
expression Υ(ξ)/ξ in the potential (5.2).

6 Discussion

In this paper we have derived the proper formulation of the potential of an arbitrarily
moving point-charge, Eq. (5.2), which leads to a current-density, Eq. (4.23), that
is locally-conserved, and to a ﬁeld strength, Eq. (5.4), which contains a δ-function
term that is absent in the customary Li´enard-Wiechert form of that ﬁeld. Since
the reasoning leading to these results is fully general, and therefore valid in the
inertial limit, the Coulomb potential in the rest frame of a point-charge should thus
be written [13]

which implies that the corresponding Coulomb ﬁeld

VC(~r) := e

Υ(r),

1
r

~EC(~r) = −~∇VC = e

~r
r3 Υ(r) − e

~r
r2 δ(r),

also has a δ-function term that is absent in the standard formulation of that ﬁeld.

As the necessity to supplement the customary Li´enard-Wiechert and Coulomb
ﬁelds by a δ-function term is quite unexpected, it is important to stress that this
conclusion was reached while remaining entirely within the realm of standard
Maxwell theory, that is without making any modiﬁcation to that theory. The only
thing that was done was to carefully analyse the nature of the singularity at the
position of the point-charge, and to use distribution theory to formulate the impli-
cations stemming from it. Moreover, while the derivation of the conserved current
was somewhat indirect in Sec. 4, its straightforward derivation from Tangherlini’s
potential

˙Z

in Sec. 5, and the rigorous mathematical justiﬁcation of that potential, make that
the replacement of the Coulomb potential and ﬁeld by Tangherlini’s expressions
Eq. (6.1) and (6.2) is of absolute physical necessity.

Another aspect of the present paper may look somewhat surprising: Distribu-
tion theory has since long been applied to classical electrodynamics by a number
of researchers, and no modiﬁcation to the Li´enard-Wiechert potential and ﬁeld was
found to be necessary, see, e.g., [14, 15]. The reason is that these researchers did
not question the standard form of the Li´enard-Wiechert potential and of the ﬁelds
deriving from it: They simply postulated that they were distributions in order to
consistently work with their singularities at ξ = 0. On the other hand, what we
have done in this paper was to uncover the proper form of the potential leading to
a point-charge current-density-distribution that is locally conserved.

19

In doing so we have in fact discovered more than we had hoped for, namely a

very striking result that can be phrased in the form of a unicity theorem:

Theorem The only potential of the form

where ϕ(ξ) is a scalar function, such that the charge-current-density

(6.7)

Finally, since the formulation of the potential and ﬁeld of an arbitrarily moving
point-charge presented in the present paper is new, there is an apparent contradic-
tion with the fact that the customary Li´enard-Wiechert formulation is an agreement
with so many applications of classical electrodynamics.

There is however no contradiction, since, on the contrary, the results of this
paper are in full agreement with the fundamental principles of electrodynamics
and mechanics. For instance, if the conserved current (4.23) is introduced in
an action integral as a scalar product J ◦ Aext with the potential of an external
ﬁeld, the differences between that current and the simple current J S of Eq. (3.1)
have in general no inﬂuence since they disappear upon integration over the whole
space. The same is true for the derivation (which also involves an integration)
of the Li´enard-Wiechert potential, i.e., Eqs. (3.3) or (5.2), by means of a Green’s
function.

Thus, the principles of physics imply that the position Z and velocity ˙Z of a
point-charge are sufﬁcient to determine the potential of its ﬁeld, while the precise

20

...
Z.

formulation of that potential as in Eq. (5.2) is necessary to determine the complete
ﬁeld and conserved current-density, which include terms that are function of ¨Z
In other words, while the simple current J S is sufﬁcient as a source
and
for determining uniquely the potential of an arbitrarily moving point-charge, the
conserved current J deriving from this potential can be very different from J S.

In conclusion, the formulation presented in this paper will make little difference
for most applications of classical electrodynamics. However, as can be seen by
studying a number of examples, the instances in which the full details of the current
density (4.23) are strictly necessary, and the additional δ-contribution in the ﬁeld
(5.4) essential, include fundamental problems like calculating the interaction of a
point-charge with itself, and similar problems in which classical electrodynamics
is apparently not consistent. The resolution of such internal contradictions is the
subject of several forthcoming publications.

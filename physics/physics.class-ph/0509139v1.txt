Abstract

In the present paper we discuss the eﬀect of artiﬁcial magneto-dielectric substrates on the
impedance bandwidth properties of microstrip antennas. The results found in the literature
for antenna miniaturization using magnetic or magneto-dielectric substrates are revised, and
discussion is addressed to the practically realizable artiﬁcial magnetic media operating in the
microwave regime. Using a transmission-line model we, ﬁrst, reproduce the known results for
antenna miniaturization with non-dispersive material ﬁllings. Next, a realistic dispersive be-
havior of a practically realizable artiﬁcial substrate is embedded into the model, and we show
that frequency dispersion of the substrate plays a very important role in the impedance band-
width characteristics of the loaded antenna. The impedance bandwidths of reduced size patch
antennas loaded with dispersive magneto-dielectric substrates and high-permittivity substrates
are compared. It is shown that unlike substrates with dispersion-free permeability, practically
realizable artiﬁcial substrates with dispersive magnetic permeability are not advantageous in
antenna miniaturization. This conclusion is experimentally validated.

Key words: Patch antenna, high-permeability materials, magneto-dielectric substrate, fre-
quency dispersion, quality factor, miniaturization.

1 Introduction

For a long time microstrip antennas have been miniaturized using diﬀerent material ﬁllings
between the radiating element and the ground plane [1, 2, 3]. Most traditionally, high per-
mittivity dielectrics have been used to decrease the physical dimensions of the radiator [4, 5].
Common problems encountered with high permittivity substrates include e.g. the excitation of
surface waves leading to lowered radiation eﬃciency and pattern degradation, and diﬃculties
in impedance matching of the antenna. During the ﬁrst heyday of so called metamaterials,
artiﬁcial high-permeability materials working in the microwave regime have gained increasing
attention [6]–[13]. The possibility to create artiﬁcial magnetism at microwave frequencies has
heated the discussion on the possibility to enhance the impedance bandwidth properties of pla-
nar radiators using magneto-dielectric substrates [17]–[21] or other electromagnetically exotic
substrates [22, 23, 24].

According to the work of Hansen and Burke [25], inductive (magnetic) loading leads to an
eﬃcient size miniaturization of a microstrip antenna. A transmission-line (TL) model for a
normal half-wavelength patch antenna predicts that increase in the permeability of the an-
tenna substrate does not reduce the impedance bandwidth of the miniaturized radiator (when
the material parameters are dispersion-free, and µeﬀ
1) [25]. Edvardsson [26]
derived a condition for the radiation quality factor Qr of a planar inverted F-antenna (PIFA),
and concluded that increase in the permeability allows size miniaturization without increasing
Qr. However, to draw a general conclusion on the practical applicability of the magnetic loading
e.g. with mobile phone antennas, there are three things which need to be clariﬁed: i) The eﬀect
of frequency dispersion of the substrate. Practically realizable artiﬁcial magnetic medium op-
erating at microwave frequencies is composed of electrically small resonating metal unit cells1,
thus, the magneto-dielectric substrate obeys strong frequency dispersion. Even though the
substrate can be considered as a paramagnetic medium when using plane wave excitation (at
the macroscopic level, over a certain frequency range), the performance is not so obvious to
predict when the resonant substrate is coupled to the antenna element. ii) The eﬀect of high ǫeﬀ
compared to µeﬀ over the matching band of the antenna. With practically realizable artiﬁcial
is known to be rather moder-
magneto-dielectric substrates for microwave frequencies Re
{
ate, thus in practice it seems very diﬃcult to achieve the condition µeﬀ
1 (outside
the resonant region of the substrate). iii) The eﬀect of losses. Realistic model representing the
losses of the substrate is needed to correctly predict the behavior of the susceptance seen at
the antenna terminal (further, the quality factor). Moreover, the numerical and experimental
results found in the literature [17]–[21] do not oﬀer a complete, quantitative comparison scheme
applicable for practical antenna design. According to the authors knowledge, the impedance
bandwidths (quality factors) of reduced size antennas loaded with practically realizable, ar-
tiﬁcial, dispersive magneto-dielectrics have not been compared to the results obtained using
high-permittivity dielectrics leading to the same size reduction. When thinking of practical
antenna design, this quantitative comparison is clearly needed to make decisions whether or
not the possibly enhanced impedance bandwidth outweights e.g. the increased manufacturing
cost and substrate weight.

1Paramagnetic response at microwave frequencies can also be achieved using hexaferrites, or composite
materials containing ferromagnetic inclusions. In the present paper we consider, however, only artiﬁcial magnetic
media composed of resonating metal inclusions.

In real life large permeabilities for microwave materials are achieved with a complex mixture
of electrically small inhomogeneities (resonating unit cells) loaded into a substrate in a speciﬁc
periodic arrangement.
In the present paper we shortly discuss the possibilities to enhance
artiﬁcial magnetism at microwave frequencies, and construct a TL model taking into account
realistic dispersive behavior of a practically realizable artiﬁcial magneto-dielectric substrate.
We start the analysis by reproducing the known miniaturization results with static material
parameters, and further extend the study to take into account frequency dispersion.
It is
shown that a substrate obeying the Lorentzian type dispersion for magnetic permeability leads
to a narrower impedance bandwidth than a high-permittivity substrate oﬀering the same size
reduction. Physical reason for the phenomena is clariﬁed. A prototype antenna is constructed
and the observation is experimentally validated.

The rest of the paper is organized in the following way: In section II we brieﬂy revise the numer-
ical and experimental results found in the literature for magneto-dielectric loading of microstrip
antennas. Section III presents a short discussion on practically realizable artiﬁcial magnetic
media and the used TL-model is presented in detail in Section IV. Section V presents the cal-
culated impedance bandwidth properties in diﬀerent loading scenarios, and an experimental
demonstration is presented in section VI. The work is concluded in Section VII.

2 Revision of numerical and experimental results

Mosallaei and Sarabandi applied in [14] a ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) simulation
scheme and investigated antenna miniaturization using a band-gap substrate consisting of di-
electric and magneto-dielectric (Z-type hexaferrite) layers. Constant scalar-permeability as-
sumption was used with substrate material parameters ǫeﬀ = 3.84(1
−
j0.018) at 277 MHz. Magneto-dielectric substrate was shown to lead to a signiﬁcantly wider
impedance bandwidth than a pure dielectric substrate oﬀering the same size reduction. The
same authors introduced in [15] an embedded circuit metamaterial structure and utilized it
under a patch antenna operating at 2.3 GHz (FDTD simulations). A 1.5 percent fractional
bandwidth was demonstrated for a 0.075λ0 size patch antenna with lossless, dispersion-free
9.6). The authors did not, however, present
substrate material parameters (µeﬀ

any result for high permittivity dielectrics leading to the same size reduction. Buell et. al [16]
measured the performance of a patch antenna utilizing an embedded circuit metamaterial at 250
MHz, and reported that miniaturization factors as high as 6.4 (with BW
−10dB 0.83 percent)
could be achieved. However, the radiation eﬃciency was measured to be only 21.6 percents,
and a comparative measurement with high-permittivity dielectrics was not conducted.

Yoon and Ziolkowski [17] simulated a microstrip antenna with diﬀerent material ﬁllings (dispersion-
free material parameters), and came to the conclusion that the optimal condition for the ef-
fective substrate material parameters is the same as predicted by Hansen and Burke [25], and
1). In [18] K¨arkk¨ainen et. al numerically studied a PIFA with
Edvardsson [26] (ǫeﬀ = 1, µeﬀ
dispersive magnetic material ﬁlling. The authors pointed out the need to regard the loaded
radiator as a system of two coupled resonators, rather than a radiator loaded with a static
paramagnetic load. The conclusion was that if the resonance of the material is considerably
higher than the resonance of the empty antenna, the material loading enables size reduction
while approximately retaining the fractional bandwidth. The eﬀective permittivity of the sub-

strate was assumed to be unity, and the design utilizing dispersive magnetic ﬁlling was not
challenged against a design utilizing dispersion-free dielectrics oﬀering the same size reduction.

Ermutlu et. al [19] loaded the volume under a half-wavelength patch antenna with a practically
realizable artiﬁcial magneto-dielectric material, and concluded based on numerical and exper-
imental results that signiﬁcant miniaturization factors could be achieved while the bandwidth
of the loaded antenna is approximately retained. The results were not, however, challenged
against results obtained using high-permittivity substrates. Authors of [20] proposed two uti-
lization schemes for a resonant magnetic media with planar radiators. The volume under a
PIFA was loaded with an array of metasolenoids [6] and the impedance bandwidth properties
were experimentally investigated. When utilizing the resonant region of the metasolenoids, the
authors designed a multiresonant antenna with signiﬁcantly enhanced impedance bandwidth.
According to the second suggestion, the metasolenoid array would behave as a paramagnetic
load enabling eﬃcient antenna miniaturization2. Authors of [21] loaded the volume under a
half-wavelength patch antenna with an array of metasolenoids and compared the impedance
bandwidth to that obtained using high-permittivity dielectrics. The result indicated that there
is practically no advantage when using the metasolenoid array.

Attempts have also been conducted to miniaturize the size of planar antennas by partially ﬁlling
the volume under the radiating element with backward-wave materials [28, 29]. With patch
antennas, in practise, ﬁlling the volume with backward-wave material corresponds to inserting
bulk inductors and capacitors to the antenna [29], thus the technique is very similar to the well
known technique of size miniaturization using reactive loads. Moreover, as expected, material
obeying realistic dispersive behavior results in signiﬁcantly narrower impedance bandwidth
than the hypothetical material with ǫeﬀ = µeﬀ =

1 [29].

3 On practically realizable artiﬁcial magnetic media at

microwave frequencies

In the present paper we restrict the discussion only to artiﬁcial magnetic media composed of
resonating metal unit cells. Other ways to enhance the magnetic response include e.g. the
utilization of ferrites, or composites ﬁlled with ferromagnetic inclusions [30, 31]. In general,
resonant artiﬁcial magnetic media can be utilized with planar radiators in two principal ways
[20]: If the resonance of the material lies inside the operational band of the (loaded) radiator,
with a suitable coupling the resonance of the material can be combined with the antenna
resonance, thus a multiresonant antenna is achieved. In other words, radiating particles are
used instead of a real material ﬁlling. Another way is to design the material to resonate at a
considerably higher frequency than the operational frequency of the loaded radiator. In the
latter case it is important that the utilized material retains its eﬀective magnetic properties
over a wide frequency band, meaning that inside the operational band of the radiator the value
> 1 (low losses are
of the real part of the eﬀective permeability is larger than unity, Re

another desired feature). This allows one to consider the material as a paramagnetic load with
(almost) constant real part for the eﬀective permeability over the desired frequency range. A

this as an advantage when trying to retain the impedance bandwidth characteristics in antenna
miniaturization with material ﬁllings, see e.g. [17, 25, 26].

The problem with most of the introduced designs for artiﬁcial magnetic media operating in the
microwave regime [6]–[13] is the fact that the eﬀective magnetism rapidly vanishes as the fre-
quency deviates from the particle resonance. Usually the maximum predicted value for the real
part of the eﬀective permeability of artiﬁcial magnetic medium (with realistic bulk concentra-
µeﬀ
tion/volume ﬁlling ratio and loss factor) is Re
4 at the resonance [8, 9, 11, 16, 27].
{
This means that in practice Re
of the magneto-dielectric substrate approaches unity very
{
quickly as the frequency deviates from the material resonance. So in practice one should utilize
> 1. This further
the particles rather close to their resonance to achieve a condition Re
{
increases the eﬀect of frequency dispersion in the impedance bandwidth characteristics. More-
over, it might not be clear anymore if the loaded antenna should be considered as a system of
two coupled resonators rather than a resonator ﬁlled with a homogenous, dispersion-free mate-
rial. In addition to this, usually the real part of the eﬀective permittivity of magneto-dielectric
substrates is considerably higher than the real part of the eﬀective permeability (when the
substrate is utilized well below its resonance). Thus, at microwave frequencies the condition
considered e.g. by Hansen and Burke (µeﬀ
1) [25] seems unlikely to be achieved
with a resonant media composed of metal unit cells. For example, with the structure presented
in [13] a realistic value for the real part of the eﬀective permeability over the operational band
of a patch antenna (operating well enough below the magneto-dielectric substrate resonance)

is Re

To give a link between the presented eﬀective medium model and practical design for artiﬁcial
magnetic media, we need to choose a unit cell for the media. In the present work we consider
the metasolenoid [6, 7] as an example unit cell for practically realizable artiﬁcial magnetic
media. Fig. 1. introduces the structural geometry of the metasolenoid. Metasolenoid is chosen
due to its simple structural geometry enabling rather straightforward, yet accurate theoretical
analysis. Moreover, experimental results can be found in the literature for the utilization of

the metasolenoid under microstrip antennas [20, 21], and the eﬀective medium model has been
experimentally validated and found to be accurate [6].

4 Transmission-line model

In this section we will derive expressions for the input impedance Zin and unloaded quality
factor Q0 of an arbitrary size strip fed patch antenna (lying on top of a large, non-resonant
ground plane). The impedance level seen directly at the patch edge is usually very high causing
diﬃculties in impedance matching of the antenna. The strip feeding allows one to conveniently
tune the impedance level seen at the feeding point, thus it oﬀers a possibility to tune the
matching in diﬀerent scenarios. A schematic illustration of the analyzed antenna structure
and the equivalent TL-model are presented in Fig. 2. The characteristic impedance of a wide
microstrip line reads [32]:

where η0 is the wave impedance in free space, h is the height of the substrate (assumed to be the
same as the height of the patch from the ground plane), l is the length of the patch, and µeﬀ and
ǫeﬀ are the eﬀective substrate material parameters. In the present model we neglect the eﬀect
of the material ﬁlling to the radiation conductance and the shunt susceptance representing the
open end extension of the TL. This is possible if the material ﬁlling leaves the ends of the patch
free so that there is a short (about the patch height) section of the empty TL just near the
radiating edges (in the present analysis the length of the empty section le = h/2). With this
assumption the radiation conductance and shunt susceptance read [1, 2]:

To relate the unloaded quality factor to the return loss characteristics, we regard the antenna
as a parallel-resonant RLC circuit in the vicinity of the fundamental resonant frequency [34].
The coupling coeﬃcient T describes the quality of the matching between the source and the
resonator and is deﬁned as

where Yf is the admittance of the feed line, and G = 1/R is the conductance of the parallel
resonator. Let us assume that the criterion for the maximum VSWR inside of the band of
interest is

parallel resonance, and usually the antenna operates in between the series and the parallel
resonance.

The dispersive behavior of the metasolenoid array is of the following form [6] (see Fig. 1):

(11)

(12)

where Λ = ab is the cross-section area of the metasolenoid, and Vr is a coeﬃcient taking into

The eﬀective permittivity of the metasolenoid array does not equal to that of the host substrate
relative permittivity (ǫeﬀ

weak (compared to the magnetic resonant behavior) [6], thus a good approximation for the
permittivity is a frequency independent expression

5 Impedance bandwidth properties

5.1 Dispersion-free material parameters

In the ﬁrst case we load the volume between the patch element and the ground plane with hypo-
thetical, lossless substrates having static material parameters. The following loading scenarios
are considered (values are for the substrate material parameters): 1) ǫeﬀ = µeﬀ = 1, 2) ǫeﬀ = 1,
µeﬀ = 8, 3) ǫeﬀ = 6.75, µeﬀ = 1, 4) ǫeﬀ = µeﬀ = 2.65. The empty antenna has dimensions (see
Fig. 2) l = w = 48.5 mm, h = 4 mm, l′ = 15 mm, w′ = 8.4 mm. With the aforementioned
dimensions the empty antenna resonates at 3.0 GHz. The dimensions of the patch loaded with
high-µ, high-ǫ, and magneto-dielectric substrates are the following: l = w = 22.5 mm, h = 4
mm, l′ = 15 mm, w′ = 1.5 mm (high-µ substrate), w′ = 1.2 mm (high-ǫ substrate and magneto-
dielectric substrate). Feed strip width w′ has been left as a free parameter and is used to tune
the quality of coupling in diﬀerent loading scenarios. With all the loading scenarios T has been
tuned to T = Topt = 1/2(S + 1/S) [34] by varying w′. This allows us to neglect the square
root term in (10) when comparing unloaded quality factors (note that coupling ﬁne tuning is
a common procedure in practical antenna design where the goal usually is to maximize the
impedance bandwidth).

Fig. 3 shows the calculated reﬂection coeﬃcient for a patch ﬁlled with diﬀerent substrates.
The main calculated parameters are gathered in Table 1. The unloaded quality factor ob-
tained from eq. (10) has been calculated using –6 dB matching criterion. We can observe from
Fig. 3 and Table 1 that the impedance bandwidth properties behave similarly as predicted by

Hansen and Burke [25]: Dispersion-free high-µ materials allow size miniaturization while prac-

bandwidth suﬀers signiﬁcantly. We can also observe from Fig. 3 that increase in permittivity
rather quickly increases the unloaded quality factor and narrows the impedance bandwidth
(case “magneto-dielectric”).

5.2 Dispersive material parameters

In most of the works found in the literature for antenna miniaturization using artiﬁcial magneto-
dielectric substrates (e.g. [15, 17]) the frequency dispersion of the substrate has been neglected,
and scalar constant-permeability assumption is used. In other words, it is assumed that the
behavior of the loaded antenna is the same if instead of embedding the full frequency dispersion
to the analysis, one picks up the values for µeﬀ at the operational frequency of the loaded
antenna. The purpose of this subsection is to check the validity of scalar constant-permeability
assumption when the substrate obeys Lorentzian type dispersion for µeﬀ.

We start the analysis with calculating the impedance bandwidth properties when the antenna is

value of the relative permittivity so that the resonant frequency of the dielectrically loaded
antenna coincides with the resonant frequency of the magneto-dielectrically loaded antenna.
The corresponding value for the relative permittivity of the reference dielectric substrate is
found to be ǫref
j.001). The dimensions of the loaded patches are the following: l =
w = 19.3 mm, h = 4 mm, l′ = 15 mm, w′ = 0.9 mm (magneto-dielectric substrate), w′ = 0.75
mm (reference dielectric substrate). To better see the possible eﬀect of frequency dispersion,
we will also consider a loading scenario in which the dispersive magneto-dielectric substrate is
replaced with a substrate having dispersion-free material parameters µeﬀ = 1.21(1

(picked up from the dispersion curve at the operational frequency of the loaded antenna),

Fig. 5 shows the calculated reﬂection coeﬃcient with diﬀerent material ﬁllings. The main
calculated parameters are gathered in Table 2. The obtained result indicates that practically
realizable magneto-dielectric substrate oﬀers no advantages over high-permittivity dielectrics.
We notice that in this particular case the frequency dispersion of the substrate is rather weak.
However, this weak dispersion added to signiﬁcantly high ǫeﬀ (as compared to µeﬀ) leads to
poor impedance bandwidth properties.
If the realistic dispersive behavior of the magneto-
dielectric substrate is replaced with a scalar constant-permeability, the TL-model predicts wider
impedance bandwidth with magneto-dielectrics than with pure high-permittivity dielectrics,

5.3 Relative radiation quality factor

Let us next derive an expression explicitly explaining the negative eﬀect of frequency dispersion.
We consider a λ/2 long section of a transmission line (which models a resonant patch element)
ﬁlled with a certain material having material parameters µ, ǫ, in general dispersive, but lossless.
A standing wave is formed under the patch. To ﬁnd the energy stored under the patch we use

where Em and Hm are the amplitudes (real) of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. This formula

Here Umax is the voltage amplitude (real) at the voltage maximum of the standing wave, and Y
is the characteristic admittance of the patch (given by eq. (1)). Practically, Umax is the voltage
at the end of the patch.

In Section 4 we mentioned that usually a patch antenna is fed by a narrower microstrip
line which introduces additional series inductance so that the whole system becomes double-
resonant. The second, series resonance appears at a bit higher frequency when the additional
inductive impedance of the narrow microstrip is compensated by the capacitive impedance of
the patch above its parallel resonance. This situation is outlined in Fig. 8. Now the total energy
stored under the patch is the sum

where W∆l is the additional energy stored under the part of the patch that exceeds λ/2 length.
λ/4 we can neglect the magnetic energy stored in this segment. Then, we get
If ∆l

≪

The amount of energy stored in the short narrow feed operating as an eﬀective inductor can
be found as follows. First, we notice that for an inductor the stored energy can be expressed
in terms of the current and voltage amplitudes on the inductor:

At the resonance the voltage amplitudes on the reactive elements of the opposite nature are
the same (if the patch susceptance dominates over the radiation conductance). Therefore, the
voltage amplitude on the inductor equals the voltage amplitude at the input of the patch, and
since the elements are connected in series the current through the inductor is the input current
of the patch:

From here

The relative quality factor (eq. (27)) is presented with diﬀerent amplitude coeﬃcients in Fig. 9

Physical understanding of the eﬀect of frequency dispersion in the substrate material parame-
ters can be achieved also by inspecting the input impedance of antennas loaded by dispersive
magneto-dielectrics and pure dielectrics leading to the same size reduction. Fig. 11 presents
the calculated input impedance when the antenna has been loaded with a practically realizable
magneto-dielectric substrate and the corresponding reference substrate (the input return loss
for this case is presented in Fig. 5). The known deﬁnition for the quality factor of a resonator
near its parallel resonance reads:

Above, ω is the angular frequency, W denotes the amount of stored energy in the volume
deﬁned by the near ﬁelds of the antenna, P is the power dissipated during one cycle, B is
the susceptance of the resonator, and G represents loss conductance. In the case of a series
resonance, B is replaced by the reactance X, and G by the loss resistance R. Physically the
behavior of the magneto-dielectric substrate is understandable from Fig. 11 and eq. (29): We

can see that the input reactancechanges more strongly at the resonance in the case of magneto-
dielectric loading. This is due to the material resonance appearing at 3.3 GHz. In terms of
electromagnetic energy, this rapid change in the input reactance corresponds to increased eﬀect
of reactive near ﬁelds leading to increased amount of stored energy, thus to increased quality

6 Experimental demonstration

We will manufacture a prototype antenna and load the volume under the antenna with an
array of metasolenoids. For reference, the impedance bandwidth will also be measured when
the volume under the antenna is loaded with high-permittivity dielectrics leading to the same
size reduction. The estimated dispersive behavior of the the manufactured metasolenoid array
and a photograph of the prototype antenna are shown in Fig. 12a and 12b, respectively. At the

operational frequency of the loaded antenna (F = 2.07 GHz) we estimate that Re

dimensions of the empty antenna are l = w = 66 mm, h = 7.5 mm, l′ = 5 mm, w′ = 4 mm.

Fig. 13 and Table 5 show the measured reﬂection coeﬃcient and gather the main measured
parameters. The radiation eﬃciency ηrad has been measured using the Wheeler cap method.
The unloaded quality factor obtained from eq. (10) has been calculated using –6 dB matching
criterion. We can see that the impedance bandwidth behaves according to the analysis pre-
sented in the paper: Practically realizable magneto-dielectric substrate does not improve the
impedance bandwidth in antenna miniaturization compared to pure dielectrics.

7 Conclusion

In the present paper we have systematically studied the eﬀect of artiﬁcial magneto-dielectric
substrates on the impedance bandwidth properties of microstrip antennas. Using the transmission-
line model we have reproduced the known results for antenna miniaturization using static ma-
terial parameters. Frequency dispersion of the substrate has been embedded into the analysis,
and it has been shown that with artiﬁcial magneto-dielectric substrates obeying the Lorentzian
type dispersion for µeﬀ, frequency dispersion can not be neglected in the analysis. A relation has
been derived for the ratio between radiation quality factors of ideally shaped antennas loaded
with dispersive magneto-dielectrics, and dispersion-free reference dielectrics. The result shows
that dispersive magneto-dielectrics lead always to larger radiation quality factor (Lorentzian
type dispersive behavior) if static Re
= 1. The main observation on the negative ef-
{
fect of frequency dispersion on the impedance bandwidth properties has been experimentally
validated.

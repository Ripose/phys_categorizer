Abstract. Quite a few future high precision space missions for testing Special and General
Relativity will use optical resonators which are used for laser frequency stabilization. These
devices are used for carrying out tests of the isotropy of light (Michelson-Morley experiment)
and of the universality of the gravitational redshift. As the resonator frequency not only
depends on the speed of
light but also on the resonator length, the quality of these
measurements is very sensitive to elastic deformations of the optical resonator itself. As
a consequence, a detailed knowledge about the deformations of the cavity is necessary.
Therefore in this article we investigate the modeling of optical resonators in a space
environment. Usually for simulation issues the Finite Element Method (FEM) is applied in
order to investigate the inﬂuence of disturbances on the resonator measurements. However, for
a careful control of the numerical quality of FEM simulations a comparison with an analytical
solution of a simpliﬁed resonator model is beneﬁcial. In this article we present an analytical
solution for the problem of an elastic, isotropic, homogeneous free-ﬂying cylinder in space
under the inﬂuence of a tidal gravitational force. The solution is gained by solving the linear
equations of elasticity for special boundary conditions. The applicability of using FEM codes
for these simulations shall be veriﬁed through the comparison of the analytical solution with
the results gained within the FEM code.

1. Motivation

Special (SR) and General Relativity (GR) are two of the most important theories and
theoretical frames of modern physics. They are the basis for the understanding of
space and time and thus for the underlying physical structure of any other theory.
The interest in testing the fundamentals of SR and GR has grown enormously over
the last years as all presently discussed approaches to quantum gravity predict tiny
violations of SR and GR.

The technological improvements of the last decades have provided scientists
with high precision measurement equipment such as optical resonators.
In optical
resonators laser locking is used to deﬁne stable optical frequencies. The resonance
frequency of the locked lasers is given by ν = mc/L where c is the speed of light, L
the resonator length L, and m the mode number.

Optical resonators have been used recently to test one of the pillars of Special
Relativity, namely the isotropy of the speed of light [7, 8] as well as of the universality
In doing so, two laser beams are locked to two
of the gravitational redshift [5].
orthogonally oriented resonators. An anisotropic speed of light would lead to a beat
of the frequencies during a rotation of this setup. Due to the importance of this type
of experiments one looks for ways to improve that. One option for this is to carry out
these experiments in space, as planned in the OPTIS mission [19] or with SUMO on
the ISS [13].

Although many of the disturbances acting on a resonator can be minimized by
means of an appropriate satellite control system, some intrinsic disturbances cannot
be eliminated as a matter of principle and distort the resonator shape leading to a
systematic frequency shift.
In particular the tidal gravitational force ‡ which acts
through every extended body cannot be eliminated by choosing an appropriate frame
and, thus, will induce distortions on the resonator.

We give a rough estimate of the expected eﬀect of the tidal gravitational force on
a freely moving cube of length L. If the position of the cube is at a distance R from
the center of the Earth, then the diﬀerence of the Earth’s acceleration on the top and
bottom of the cube is ∆a = (∂2U/∂r2)L, where U is the Earth’s Newtonian potential
U = GM⊕/R. For an orbit with R = 10000 km and a typical resonator length of
L = 5 cm we have ∆a ≈ GM⊕/R3L ≈ 2 · 10−8 m/s2. In a rough estimate we assume
this ∆a to act on the top surface of the cube. Now Hook’s simple law of elasticity

F

= E

∆L
L

∆L

∆a ≈ 10−17

gives the change of the length ∆L of the cube due to a force F acting on the area A.
In our case taking F = m∆a = ρL3∆a we get

assuming an elasticity modulus of E = 90 GPa and a density of 2350 kg/m3 which is
typical for Zerodur.

In the OPTIS mission, for example, the science goal for the measurement of the
isotropy of the speed of light is better than ∆c/c = 10−18 [19]. This can only be
achieved if the resonator has a length stability of ∆L/L = 10−18 [19]. As one can see
from our estimates, the tidal gravitational force will lead to systematic deformations

In space and engineering sciences the tidal gravitational force is often referred to as ’gravity

‡
gradient’.

which are one order of magnitude larger than the expected accuracy. Therefore the
eﬀect has to be investigated carefully by including the tidal gravitational force into
the equations of elasticity, calculating the resulting resonator shape, and then subtract
the eﬀect.

Although the linear theory of elasticity has a long history, explicit solutions for
special problems are purely spread.
In textbooks only examples for simple bodies
in homogeneous gravitational ﬁelds or for thermal expansions can be found (e.g.
[14], [15], [18]). However, most of the solutions employ an ansatz which already
includes knowledge about the expected solution. To the understanding of the authors,
no publications are available dealing with a body under the inﬂuence of a tidal
gravitational force so far. The reason for this is probably, that this situation applies
only to bodies freely ﬂying in space – a situation which was outside the scope of
application in elasticity theory so far.

In the present paper we ﬁrst derive an analytical solution in terms of a series
expansion. This result is then conﬁrmed using numerical methods. These calculations
are usually done with help of Finite Element Method (FEM) codes. For most
engineering purposes FEM codes are ﬁne. However FEM solutions are only numerical
approximations whose accuracy depends highly on the number and shape of the
elements that have been chosen to mesh the model. In order to conﬁrm the analytical
model and to test the numerical calculation, we compare the analytical with the
numerical solution. For this comparison we choose a cylinder as most simple geometry
of a body adapted to the symmetry of the problem.

Having thus checked the principal applicability of the FEM methods to these kinds
of physical situations, this method safely can be used for calculating the deformations
of arbitrarily shaped bodies or for the design of devices insensitive to unwanted
inﬂuences, or for the elimination of the systematics of the measurements in order
to ensure the success of highly sensitive experiments.

2. Basic Equations

2.1. Generalities

The problem of an optical resonator ﬂying on a geodetic Earth orbit can be simpliﬁed
by treating the problem in a body ﬁxed coordinate system. We also consider, for
simplicity, the body to be a homogeneous and isotropic cylinder. The only force
present is a volume force due to the tidal gravitational force which will be modeled as
gradient of a spherically symmetric Earth acceleration ﬁeld.

In order to calculate the elastic deformations of the cylinder the equations of
elasticity have to be solved including the inﬂuence of the tidal gravitational force. The
boundary conditions for the solution are given through the condition of weightlessness
in space.

As a short introduction, some basic equations of the linear theory of elasticity are
given [15, 14, 18, 11]. All equations refer to homogeneous isotropic bodies. Within this
paper we do not use the notation within the formalism of the Riemannian geometry
(e.g. [20]) but the notation used in [15].

In elasticity the general relation between the stress tensor σij and the strain tensor

εij is given by Hooke’s law

σij = Cijklεij

i, j, k, l = 1, 2, 3

(3)

Deformation of a Cylinder under Tidal Gravitational Forces

where Cijkl is the elasticity tensor related to the material under consideration. For
homogeneous isotropic materials the elasticity tensor can be written as

Cijkl = λδij δkl + µ(δikδjl + δilδjk) ,

where λ and µ are the Lam´e constants and δmn is the Kronecker symbol. Thus Hook’s
law for homogeneous isotropic materials is

σij = λδij εkk + 2µεij .

The strain tensor ε has to fulﬁll the so-called compatibility condition

2.2. The symmetries of our problem

Since we have an axial symmetric problem, we use cylindrical coordinates r, ϕ, z is
useful. All displacements and derivatives with respect to ϕ vanish and the equilibrium

Beside the axial symmetry we also have the following symmetries for reﬂection at

3. The Problem

In order to solve the problem of a free-ﬂying isotropic homogeneous cylinder in space
the equilibrium equation of elasticity (10) has to be solved. The cylinder has radius
R and height 2L. The body coordinates are (r, ϕ, z) with the origin being at the
center–of–mass of the cylinder. The z–axis coincides with the symmetry axis of the
cylinder, see Fig. 1.

The only force present is the volume force ~K which is due to the Earth’s

gravitational potential U ,

For a spherical Earth potential, U (r) = GM⊕/r, where GM⊕ is the gravitational
constant times the mass of Earth, the potential acting at an arbitrary point P inside
the cylinder can be calculated via Taylor expansion

where ~rM is the vector from the center–of–mass of the Earth to the center–of–mass
of the cylinder and ~r is the vector from the cylinder center–of–mass to point P . This
Taylor expansion around the center–of–mass of the cylinder to second order gives the
axis-symmetric potential in cylindrical coordinates. Note that the linear term of the
Taylor expansion vanishes as this equation is valid in the freely falling reference frame
of the cylinder.

Since we consider a freely ﬂying cylinder in an orbit around the Earth, no external
forces are present and, thus, the forces ~p at the cylinder surfaces are zero which gives
us the boundary conditions

σij nj = pi = 0 .

(22)
The normal vector ~n = (nr nϕ nz)T (T means the transposed vector) reduces in

the axis-symmetric case to ~n = (nr 0 nz)T , as the ϕ component is zero.

Thus the boundary conditions (22) at the top surface of the cylinder, i.e.

for

z = L, ~n = (0 0 1)T , are

pr(r, z = L) = 0 = σrz(r, z = L)
pz(r, z = L) = 0 = σzz(r, z = L) .

pr(r, z = −L) = 0 = −σrz(r, z = −L)
pz(r, z = −L) = 0 = −σzz(r, z = −L) .

At the bottom surface of the cylinder, i.e. for z = −L, ~n = (0 0 −1)T , we have

(20)

(21)

(23)

(24)

Note that these boundary conditions are valid for arbitrary r ∈ [0, R). For r = R
they are not valid as the normal vector is not uniquely deﬁned at the cylinder edges
(r, z) = (R, ±L).

For the superﬁcies cylinder surface, i.e. r = R, ~n = (1 0 0)T , the boundary

conditions are

pr(r = R, z) = 0 = σrr(r = R, z)
pz(r = R, z) = 0 = σzr(r = R, z)

for all z ∈ [0, ±L).

4. The Solution

4.1. Particular Solution

In order to ﬁnd a particular solution of the problem one can assume that the solution
of the equilibrium equation can be written as gradient of a scalar ψ [18]

~ξp = ∇ψ .

Inserting this approach into Eq. (19) yields

Note that the Laplace operator applied to a vector ﬁeld has the form given in Equation
(17).

The boundary conditions the homogeneous solution part has to fulﬁll can be
derived from the boundary conditions (22) of the complete solution. The boundary
conditions at the cylinder top surface, i.e. z = L, normal vector ~n = (0 0 1)T , are

pr(r, z = L) = 0 = σrz(r, z = L) = σh
pz(r, z = L) = 0 = σzz(r, z = L) = σh

rz(r, z = L) + σp
zz(r, z = L) + σp

The Love function χ necessarily fulﬁlls the biharmonic equation

(43)
The major obstacle is to ﬁnd an adequate approach for the Love function fulﬁlling
all boundary conditions. A general approach is the separation of variables, that means
a factorization of the kind χ(r, z) = F1(r) · F2(z). For axial symmetric problems
the Bessel functions (see Appendix A) are the natural choice to represent the r
dependence. Owing to the additional reﬂection symmetry and antisymmetry of ξr
and ξz, the z dependence can be represented by the trigonometric functions cosine and
sine. Bessel functions as well as trigonometric functions form a complete orthogonal
set of functions so that each function can be represented as a series of these sets.

For the solution of the homogeneous equation of elasticity a so-called Papkovich-
Neuber approach for the displacement ﬁeld can be made [12]. One writes ~ξ =
, where Φ is a scalar, and the vector ~B fulﬁlls
∇Φ + 4(1 − ν) ~B − ∇
the biharmonic equation. For ~B and B0 the approach of separation of variables is
used where the r dependency is represented by Bessel functions and the z dependency
is represented by trigonometric functions. By modifying this approach one can make
an ansatz for the Love function suggested in [21]

Addition of Eqs. (67) and (71) gives

with S = R + Z from which we can determine B0 and D0. Eq. (72) yields

The unknowns c and d from the particular solution part can be chosen arbitrarily.
Their inﬂuence on the homogeneous solution part is restricted to B0 and D0 and is
compensated in the complete solution.

the equations for the determination of the homogeneous solution part as derived in

Now we have determined all unknown coeﬃcients in Equation (44). Then,
following Eq. (41) we can directly calculate the homogeneous displacement. By adding
the homogeneous and the particular solution we get the total displacement of the
cylinder.

4.2.7. Convergence of the Homogeneous Solution The inﬁnite system (77,78) can be
approximately solved by reducing it to a ﬁnite system, that is, by expanding the sums
only to n = N and j = J. Then we have a system of N + J equations. By increasing
the values of N and J one can improve the accuracy of the solution and ﬁnd their
limits.

This approach is justiﬁed, since we can prove that these inﬁnite sums do converge,
that means, that the inﬁnite system (77,78) possesses a unique bounded solution. In
doing so we have to use the theory of regular inﬁnite systems as has been done by [12]
and [21].

In the following we will show ﬁrst that the equation system (77,78) is a regular
inﬁnite system and second that it possesses a unique solution. For the sake of simplicity
we introduce the abbreviations

the Bessel functions, it can be shown that also Pn > 0. Therefore no singularities
can occur. Furthermore Ψ and Φ are positive deﬁnite series and none of their terms

becomes one for all values of n and j, thus 1 − Ψn and 1 − Φj are always smaller than
zero. Therefore, (87) is regular.

The ﬁnal conclusion that the regular inﬁnite system (77,78) has a unique bounded
solution can be inferred from a theorem [10], that a regular inﬁnite system (87) whose
free terms bi fulﬁll the condition

|bi| ≤ Kρi

does have a bounded solution |zi| ≤ K, where K is an arbitrary constant.

From (98) its obvious that ρi = 1 − |1 − Ψi| = |Ψi| and ρi = 1 − |1 − Φi| = |Φi|.

Thus the condition |bi| ≤ Kρi can be divided into two conditions

and

Since K1 and K2 are arbitrary constants they can be chosen to be

which fulﬁlls the above condition. One can choose K to be K = K1 = 4ˆc2
2+2ν , as the
Poisson number ν lies between 0 and 0.5 and therefore K1 > K2. Thus we have proven
that the condition for the existence of a bounded solution is fulﬁlled.

5. Comparison between Analytical and FEM Solution

Having proven that the inﬁnite equation system (77,78) possesses a unique bounded
solution, we can now numerically calculate this solution with arbitrary order of
accuracy by expanding the inﬁnite series to suﬃciently large numbers N = J.
Although the inﬁnite series converge very quickly, an expansion to higher orders N = J
still gives an improvement of accuracy which can be seen in Table 1.

Fig. 2 shows the resulting total displacement ﬁeld from the analytical solution
of Equation (14). The inﬁnite sums in the analytical solution were expanded to
N = J = 1700.

Now we can compare our analytical solution for our simpliﬁed problem with the
result obtained with help of a ﬁnite element code in order to verify its applicability.

ﬁeld as result of the FEM calculation.

Table 2 contains a quantitative comparison between the displacements from the
analytical and FEM solution for special points of the cylinder. Analytical as well as
FEM solution are completely symmetric, i.e. the norms of the displacements of two
opposing points of the cylinder are equal. Please note that we have chosen a very ﬁne
mesh for the ﬁnite element solution in order to get high accuracy.

Obviously, the FEM solution and the analytical solution agree very well. The
small diﬀerences are based on the nature of the FEM analysis. The elements in which
the cylinder is divided cannot be chosen to be inﬁnite small, they are ’ﬁnite’ and thus
the FEM solution is a kind of summation over all elements of ﬁnite size instead of
an integration where the limit to inﬁnitesimal small element size can be performed.
Furthermore during the FEM analysis at least three points must be ﬁxed in order
to prevent the cylinder from rigid body rotations. In the current FEM analysis the
center of mass as well as four of the next nodes were ﬁxed in order to assure the perfect
symmetry of the FEM solution.

6. Summary and Outlook

An analytical solution for the problem of an elastic, isotropic, homogeneous freely–
ﬂying cylinder in space under the inﬂuence of a tidal gravitational force has been
worked out. The motivation for this work was the veriﬁcation of the use of FEM
codes for modeling the deformations of optical resonators in high precision space
experiments.
It could be shown that the analytical and the FEM solutions are
equal within the limits set by the nature of the diﬀerent solution approaches. The
analytical solution itself gives a new application ﬁeld for the theory of elasticity as so
far (according to the knowledge of the authors) no examples with tidal gravitational
forces have been calculated.

A further application case of such analytical solutions is the estimation of the
noise due to thermoelastic deformations in gravitational wave detectors. In particular
with respect to the upcoming LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) mission
[6] these investigations are of great interest. Some groups already dealt with this
problem, see [3, 16]. However, the solutions are given for inﬁnite half–spaces only or
some approximations have to be included in order to satisfy all boundary conditions.
Therefore we are currently working on an exact analytical solution for the estimation
of thermoelastic noise in gravitational wave detectors.

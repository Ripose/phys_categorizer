Abstract

In this paper we put forward a mechanism in which imploding shock waves emit electromagnetic
∼
radiation in the spectral region λ0
= 2πR0., where R0 is the radius of the shock by the time it is ﬁrst
formed. The mechanism relies on three diﬀerent pieces of Physics: Maxwell’s equations, the existence
of corrugation instabilities of imploding shock waves and, last but not least, the Inertial Polarization
Principle. The principle is extensively discussed: how it emerges from very elementary physics and
ﬁnds experimental support in shock waves propagating in water. The spectrum of the emitted light
is obtained and depends upon two free parameters, the amplitude of the instabilities and the cut-oﬀ
Rmax, the shocks’ spatial extension. The spectral intensity is determined by the former , but its
shape turns out to have only a mild dependence on the latter, in the region of physical interest.
The matching with the observed spectrum requires a ﬁne tuning of the perturbation amplitude
ε ∼ 10−14,indicating a quantum mechanical origin. Indeed, we support this conjecture with an order
of magnitude estimative. The Inertial Polarization Principle clues the resolution of the noble gas
puzzle in SL.

The Inertial Polarization Principle

In this paper we put forward a mechanism responsible for transducing the kinetic energy stored in an
imploding spherical shock wave into electromagnetic radiation, which is based solely upon Maxwell’s
equations, the existence of very small instabilities away from the spherically symmetric ﬂow and the
inertial polarization paradigm. Based on these premisses we obtained the spectral intensity of the
outgoing radiation. The mechanism turns out to be so eﬃcient that the observed energy emission rate of
P (λ) ∼ 10−10W att/nm calls for perturbation amplitudes no larger than ε = 10−14! Maxwell’s equations
are a pillar of theoretical physics while inertial polarization is a consequence of very elementary physics
: an atom that undergoes an acceleration, say a , develops in its interior polarized electromagnetic
ﬁelds. The issue is made clear for an observer sitting in the frame of the molecule, where he sees inertial
forces acting both upon the nucleus FN = MN a and on the electronic cloud Fe = Mea. The gradient
between these forces tends to sag the cloud away from the nucleus, and the atom develops internal
polarization ﬁelds, say E0, to compensate this gradient e E0 ∼ (MN − Me)a . The role of inertial
polarization remained hitherto unnoticed only because detectable polarization ﬁelds call for tremendous
accelerations, say, E0 ∼ 1V /m would require a ∼ (e/Mp)E0 ∼ 10−2(eV /(Mpc2))(c2/cm) ∼ 1010cm/ sec2
which are absent in every day life experiments. Nevertheless, there are two instances where such large
accelerations manifest: i.) in the realm of very strong gravitational ﬁelds where inertial polarization was
shown to be the working mechanism that rescues the second law of thermodynamics from bankruptcy
(otherwise super-luminal motion of black-holes inside dielectric media would entail a violation of the
generalized second law [1],[2]); ii) in the realm of shock waves, because shocks are powerful accelerators
of ﬂuid molecules: a ﬂuid molecule that crosses the shock undergoes a macroscopic velocity change (of
the order of the ﬂuid velocity itself ) within a microscopic distance – the shock width (of the order of the
mean free path for the atomic collisions [3]).

The inertial polarization principle is the single non-very-well-established piece of physics in our recipe
and we proceed by making our case for it. Consider a planar strong shock wave propagating within a
perfect gas. Let v2 and v1 represent the ﬂuid velocity in the back and in front the shock, respectively
( likewise, the index 2 (1) refer to physical quantities behind (in front) the shock ). As the ﬂuid molecules
cross the shock they experience a mean acceleration ¯a = (v2 − v1)( ¯∆t), where ¯∆t is the mean time it
takes the gas to cross the shock-width δ. Clearly ¯∆t = δ/¯v, where ¯v ∼= (v1 + v2)/2, is the mean velocity.
Putting these pieces together

where V1 is the gas’ speciﬁc volume. The compression rate satisﬁes V1/V2 = (γ + 1)/(γ − 1)[3]

The shock width δ is known to be of order of the mean free path for collisions of atoms in the ﬂuid,
δ ≈ (nσ)−1, where n stands for the number density of atoms and σ for the collision’s cross section.
Bearing in mind that nV = A/µ where A is Avogadro’s number and µ is the molecular weight of the gas,
we obtain the colossal ﬁgure for the mean acceleration atoms experience as they cross the shock:

Shock Polarization was ﬁrst observed in the early sixties [4] for shock waves propagating inside water.
Since then, both quality and range of the measurements improved considerably [6]. Harris [5, 6] credits
the eﬀect to the fact that large pressure gradients inside the shock results in a torque ﬁeld acting upon
the water molecule causing the molecule’s dipole to align. We reproduce his results via the table:

The underlying Physics for a shock propagating in water is the very same as for a gas and we infer
the averaged electric potential across the shock from eq.(6) bearing in mind that:
i.)˜the compression
rate for water is of order one, therefore we go one step back in this equation by replacing γ/(γ − 1) →
γ/(γ + 1) ≃ 1/2); ii.)˜the equation was obtained for a gas and for liquids it should be regarded as the
linear expansion of the function V (p). Then it follows that V (mV )/p(kbar) ∼ 0.6 , in agreement with
the lower pressure region of the experimental data. Detection of shock polarization for non-polar ﬂuids
would vindicate the Inertial Polarization Principle.

The acceleration ﬁeld inside planar shocks is space and time independent (and so the corresponding
polarized electromagnetic ﬁelds) . Nevertheless, planar shocks are known to develop corrugation instabili-
ties [3], small deformations of the planar geometry that detach from the shock and propagate throughout
the ﬂuid. They correspond to the spontaneous emission of sound from the shock. These instabilities will
cause a space time dependent acceleration ﬁeld inside the shock, and by the Inertial Polarization Principle
a wiggling 6 × 103V /m electric ﬁeld vector that is radiated away: sound and light are emitted simulta-
neously , provided the Inertial Polarization relaxation time is small enough. This brings to one’s mind
the famous and intriguing sonoluminescence eﬀect [7] in which under heavy bombarding of ultra-sound
waves, a little ( 5µm) bubble of air cavitating within a ﬂask of water undergoes a spectacular collapse,
attains the supersonic regime and glows (mainly) violet light. The eﬀect has been around for sixty years
or so ( [8],[?]) and proper understanding of the problem remains elusive. The most popular mechanism
is the Bremsstrahlung from free electrons in the gas where the ionization is caused by two successive
heating processes: ﬁrst the adiabatic collapse of the bubble which is then followed by the motion of a
shock wall inside the bubble (the shock’s Mach number controls the temperature rate T2/T1 ∼ M 2) [10].
The formation of a shock wall, a collapsing spherical front of radius R(t) = A(−t)α (α < 1), happens
by the time supersonic regime is attained inside the bubble [7]. The acceleration of the shock front surface
a(t) ∼ A(−t)α−2, becomes very large at focusing (t → 0) engendering very large space and time depen-
dent Inertial-Polarization ﬁelds. Nevertheless, the spherical symmetric geometry of the problem prevents
these ﬁelds to be radiated away: pursuing the present avenue seems to require some supplementary mech-
anism to account for the radiation ﬂash (a sparking mechanism was proposed [11, 12]). Fortunately, no
supplementary mechanism is needed: numerical calculations ([13]) have shown the existence of unstable
perturbations of the collapsing shock which provide the multipole time-dependent inertial-polarization
ﬁelds that are radiated away. The purpose of this paper is to calculate the spectral distribution of the
emitted light .

The paper is organized as follows. The following section reviews the dynamics of imploding shocks,
and the existence of unstable multipole perturbation modes is rigorously proved. As a bonus, we obtain
the energy and the power carried away by the sound waves that detach from the shock (corrugation
instabilities). A novel semi-analytical procedure for solving the diﬀerential equations for the perturbations
is developed, which nevertheless, is displayed in the appendix in order prevent the disruption of the
main argument line with technicalities. In section II , we obtain the polarization ﬁelds engendered by
the corrugation instabilities and show that they act as a source term in Maxwell’s equations. Then
we calculate the spectrum of the outgoing radiation. The spectrum depends on the dynamics of the
corrugation instabilities, but fortunately it is possible to obtain the main structure of the spectrum
without having to delve too deeply into the dynamics. The intensity of the outgoing radiation turned

3

p/(2α~), is
out to be proportional to pε2 where ε is the corrugation instability amplitude and p = E2
Inertial-Polarization power-constant (Ep stands for the proton’s rest energy and α for the ﬁne structure
constant). This constant is of the order ⋍ 1.47 × 1016 Watt (!): collapsing shock waves are the most
eﬃcient power-stations in nature, with the sole possible exception of astrophysical objects! Agreement
with the experimental data calls for amplitudes of the order ε ∼ 10−13 or δr ∼ 10−19m! These tiny
perturbations must have a quantum mechanical origin, and we support this conjecture by an order of
magnitude estimative. Finally we suggest the resolution of the noble gas puzzle in SL.

1 Dynamics of Imploding Shocks

The non-viscous implosion of a spherical shock cannot be characterized by any dimensional parameter .
Consequently the ﬂow admits a self-similar symmetry. Let R(t) = Ai(−t)α represent the radius of the
shock front, where Ai and α are two constants and vshock = αR(t)/t, its implosion velocity. The self
similar parameter here is ξ = r/R(t); the surface of the shock is given by ξ = 1. Self-similarity constrains
the form of the speed of sound, radial ﬂow velocity and density [14] :

The equations that govern the ﬂow are the entropy and mass conservation laws and Euler’s equation .
They provide a set of non-linear coupled equations for G(ξ), V (ξ) and Z(ξ), which when solved for Z(V )
and ξ(V ), yield the pair of equations [3]

where κ = 2(1 − α)/(αγ).
Inspection of these equations reveals the existence of a singular point at
Z = (1 − V )2 ( dV /dξ → ∞?). Clearly, all physical quantities, and their derivatives must be ﬁnite across
the singular point, meaning that the conditions (3V − κ)Z − V (1 − V )(1/α − V ) = 0 and Z = (1 − V )2 are
simultaneous to each other at this point, such as to keep their ratio ﬁnite. Call Vc(α), Zc(α) the solution
of this pair of algebraic equations. The parameter α is obtained by numerically integrating Z(V ) from
V = V (1) to Vc for diﬀerent values of α until the matching Z(Vc(α)) = Zc(α) is obtained. The good
values for α are 0.688376/0.71717 for a monatomic/diatomic gas. The limit t → 0− corresponds to the
shock’s focusing time, after which the shock reﬂects and reexpands. For latter reference, we mention the
asymptotic behavior V ∼ ξ−1/α as ξ → ∞ [3].

We are seeking now perturbations away from this ﬂow. Let δ = δρ/ρ be the contrast function and δ~v
the velocity ﬂuctuation. The latter can be decomposed into its normal and perpendicular components
δvn = ~n · ~v , δ~v⊥ = δ~v − δvn~n.

remain ﬁnite at any time and at focusing it requires that 1/α − 2.5 ≤ Re(β) ≤ 0. In the appendix we
develop a semi-analytical method for solving eq.(21) and obtaining the correspondent spectrum for βl,n.
In consonance with previous numerical calculations ([13]) we conﬁrm that β lies in this interval. By the
way, the most unstable modes are shown to lie in the interval.5 + 1/α < Re(β) < −2.5 + 3/(2α) , even

Inertial Polarization At Work

As discussed already, electromagnetic bounded systems whose constituents have sizeable mass diﬀerences,
say ∆M , and which are subjected to a strong acceleration ﬁeld d~v/dt engender polarization ﬁelds ~E0, ~B0
that tend to restore the balance between electromagnetic and inertial forces. Clearly, these polarization
ﬁelds satisfy

Fortunately, the major features of the spectrum can be obtained without delving into the diﬀerential
equations. For instance, in the region where kRmax < 1 we can approximate jl(x) ≃ (2x)ll!/(2l + 1)! and

In the other end of the spectrum kR0 > 1, taking the asymptotic expression jl(x) ≈ 1/x sin(x−lπ/2)

integral the measure x2+β (with 2 + β > 1) ensures that important contributions to the integral comes
from the large arguments. Thus,

3 Assessment of the Results

The present SL mechanism relies on very basic pieces of physics, the existence of corrugation instabilities
in spherical shocks, whose existence is well known, Maxwell’s equations and the inertial polarization

10

paradigm. As we had the opportunity to explain, this paradigm stems from very elementary physics and
it has remained hitherto unnoticed only because huge accelerations are required for sizeable polarizations.
The detection of shock polarization in non-polar liquids would lend an undisputable status to the inertial
polarization principle . In the transduction of sound into radiation , the ﬂash of light must be coincident
with a burst of sound since the emission of radiation is caused by corrugation instabilities . According to
eq.(50), only one ﬁeld-mode is related to the sonoluminescent light. This mode has a longitudinal electric
ﬁeld component E1, and some experiment must be devised to detect it .The transversal component
E2 points into the direction of the vector

and this (weird) polarization should be observed in sonoluminescent light.

Physics is seldom controlled by cut-oﬀ parameters, and we expect the cut-oﬀ parameter Rmax ( the
bubble’s ambient radius) to play a marginal role in delimiting the frequency band where light is emitted.
The main features of the spectrum should be controlled by the remaining parameters: R0, the radius of
the shock-wave when it is ﬁrst formed and the perturbation amplitude ε . Thus, R0 should characterize
the typical wave-length of the emitted light λ ≈ λ0 = 2πR0. Our asymptotic results [eq.(69)] conﬁrms this
feeling. Numerical and theoretical studies of the dynamics of imploding shocks support the picture that
the bubble collapses at the speed of sound by the time it passes through its ambient radius as the right
criterion both for shock formation and the existence of SL ([15]- [17]). According to these investigations,
at 100ps before the bubble reaches its minimum size, a shock wave of initial radius R0 = 0.15µm develops:
by this time the interface is imploding with 4 to 5 times the ambient speed of sound. With these ﬁgures,
we predict the emitted light to lie in λ ≈ λ0 = 900nm spectral region, regardless the kind of gas present
in the bubble; in SL experiments light is observed in the 200nm . λ . 800nm interval. According
to this result, it is legitimate to infer the spectrum in this wave-length interval through the asymptotic
formula for λ - λ0[see eq.(69)]. How does the particular kind of gas present in the bubble impact on the
the emission power? The dependence of the emitted light upon the particular type of gas present in the
bubble stems from two diﬀerent factors:

i.) diﬀerent values of the adiabatic index γ leads to a diﬀerent shock-wave and corrugation instability

dynamics; ii.) diﬀerent gases have diﬀerent dielectric permeability ǫ.

The dielectric nature of the gas is implemented through the replacement E → D in the Poynting
ǫ(k)gl(λ) . Diﬀerent

vector, which corresponds to the replacement of |Wl(k)|2 by

ǫ(k) |Wl(k)|2 , or gl(λ)→

adiabatic indexes would cause hl(k) to change because both the spectrum of β and the dynamical
coeﬃcients bn , depend upon γ. These two conditions will cause a change on the shape of the function gl(λ)

e

e

. Assuming that after taking these corrections into account, the function gl(λ) still remains marginally
dependent upon the wave-length (non power law), the overall change produced by diﬀerent gases in the
shape on the logartithmic representation of the spectrum ln P ∼ −3 ln λ + ln gl(λ) + const for λ . λ0
, is a displacement of the nearly parallel lines of inclination m ∼= −3. This behaviour is changed as
we approach the λ << λ0 region because then the dielectric constant being governed by the plasma
frequency of the gas, causes the function ln gl(λ) to strongly depend upon λ .

Infering the uncorrected spectra for transmission by the surrounding medium observed by Hiller in SL
experiments for bubbles trapping pure noble gases bubbles at 00C ([18]) we infered m ∼= −2.7. For pure
He, m ∼= −2.5. Inspection of the spectra shows the nearly linear dependence for Ar, He, He3,and N e.
The agreement is less accurate for Xe and Kr, for reasons which are presently unclear: it might well be
the that heavier noble gases cannot be handled with the naive classical Inertial Polarization picture, they
have too much internal structure and must be handled with a full quantum mechanical approach. The
spectrum for a mixture of 1% of He and N2 closely resemble the behavior of pure He2([18]). Diﬀerences
might be credited to the superimposition of the Bremsstrahlung spectrum of free electrons of the ionized

11

N2 gas in the mixture to the original spectrum, or even the eﬀect of the Inertial-Polarization ﬁelds upon
these electrons.

Regarding now the intensity of the outgoing radiation, it is governed by the product pε2 . A small p
would require large corrugation instabilities, invalidating the linear regime approximations. Surprisingly,
p/(2~α) ⋍ 1.47 × 1016 Watt , imploding shocks are fantastic power stations ! Actually, we have
p = E2
to worry to have suﬃciently small perturbations to ﬁt the experimental data! Typical power emissions
are of of the order of 10−11W att/nm in the λ0 region [18],
calling for an amplitude ε ∼ 10−12 or
δr = εR0 ∼ 10−19m, which being much smaller then the nuclear dimensions can have only a quantum
mechanical origin. Now, the radius of the shock at the moment it is formed R0 is governed by the radius of
the bubble wall Rb, by the time it is collapsing at 4-5 times the ambient speed of sound. The dependence

of the former on the latter is linear. In a semi-classical approach, it is to be expected that the ﬂuctuations
on the shape of the imploding shock are also governed by bubble wall ﬂuctuations, ǫ = δR0/R0 = δRb/Rb.
The ﬂuctuations of the bubble interface should be of the order of the bubble’s Compton wave-length λb
and δr = (R0/Rb)λb ∼ λp/N , where λp ∼ 10−15m is the Compton wave-length of the proton and N
is the number of gas atoms trapped inside the bubble , N ∼ 107. Thus, in this scenario δr ∼ 10−22m,
which is close to the amplitude needed to ﬁt the observed intensity of the radiation.

One of the most intriguing issues in SL is beyond any doubt the noble gas puzzle: only bubbles
containing noble gas,even at very small concentrations, glow. What can we say in this respect? Does
our paradigm shed some light in this direction? Here is a clue. As the bubble collapses and the attains
supersonic regime the adiabatic heating raises the gas temperature to ∼ 0.4eV ([19]) . The gas is further
heated when it crosses the shock front, the temperature is increased by a factor M 4 . This is more than
enough to bring diatomic gases to their excited states, but not for noble gases. The dipole contribution
p| Ψlmni · r−3 of the excited states being much larger than the Inertial Polarization Fields will
hΨlmn |
wash away information regarding the latter. A full quantum mechanical calculation should resolve this
issue.

There are immense challenges ahead. From the theoretical point of view, one needs to calculate the
detailed spectrum taking full account of the shock dynamics, study the back reaction of the polarized
ﬁelds upon the dynamics, clarify whether the polarization caused by quantum mechanical transitions of
a diatomic molecule are the culprits for washing out the Inertial Polarization ﬁelds, etc. The immediate
experimental challenge is to detect Shock Polarization in non-polar ﬂuids. If the eﬀect is conﬁrmed in
non-polar ﬂuids then it will be very hard to defuse the present transduction mechanism.

perturbational approach in powers (V1 − Vc), once the state |X(V1)i is known. The only missing piece of
information is the set of boundary conditions for the perturbed ﬁelds.

The boundary conditions for the perturbed ﬂow

Supersonic motion produces a discontinuity in the ﬂuid ﬂow known as a shock wave or simply shock. Let
us call ~v2 and ρ2 the ﬂuid velocity and density, and c2 the speed of sound behind the shock, as measured
in the laboratory frame(likewise, the subscript 1 refers to the same quantities in the front of the shock).
The normal to the shock is ~n and its velocity in the lab frame is ~vshock. The discontinuities have to fulﬁll
the following conditions at the shock surface [3]

δr(t, θ, φ) = 0. The corresponding perturbed normal is δ~n = −~∇δr, the perturbed shock velocity is ˙δr
while the location of the shock itself in self-similar coordinate is 1 + δξ, δξ = δr/R(t). Accordingly,

Numerical Procedure

Our procedure for resolving the spectrum of β consists of ﬁrst ﬁtting the unperturbed ﬂow (Z(V ), dV (V ))
by a polynomial in V , from which we extract the matrices A and B(V ) as power series in V . Then
through the recurrence formulae (??) we obtain the expansion coeﬃcients Yn(β) up to a given order
and insert then into eq.(78), in conjunction with the above boundary condition |X(V1)i [eq.(85) ] . This
procedure yields a polynomial equation for β , which is solved numerically. We display the results for
γ = 7/5, l = 1, 2, 3, 4.

Abstract

Generation of long wavelength edge radiation along directions nearly coincident with the axes of
straight sections of storage rings and synchrotrons is discussed. The removal of destructive interference
from the superimposed edge radiation patterns of a straight section on the synchrotron ”Pakhra” has
been observed experimentally.

Introduction

The concept of long wavelength radiation was introduced in classical electrodynamics for the case of a
particle emitting radiation in external ﬁelds. The spectral-angular distribution of the long wavelength
electromagnetic energy emitted by the particle doesn’t tend to zero when the frequency of the emitted
radiation tends to zero [1, 2]. The electromagnetic wave components of long wavelength radiation have
mainly one sign. The Fourier transform of their electric ﬁeld strength ~Eω|ω=0 6= 0 [3] - [6].

The object of this paper is to discuss the problem of generation of radiation with properties near to the
long wavelength radiation by a particle or particle beams in external electromagnetic ﬁelds of synchrotrons
and storage rings. Some experimental results carried out in the beginning of 1980 will be presented.

2 Selected questions of the classical electrodynamics

The electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths of a non-uniformly moving charged particle are determined by

~E(t) = ~Ec(t) + ~Er(t),

~H = [~n ~E],

(1)

where

~Ec(t) =

e(1 − β2)(~n − ~β)

R2(1 − ~n~β)3

|t′ ,

~Er(t) =

˙~β]]
e[~n[(~n − ~β)
cR(1 − ~n~β)3

|t′ ,

˙~β are the charge, velocity, and acceleration of the particle; ~n, the unit vector directed from a
e, c~β and c
particle to the observation point, and R, the distance from the particle to the observation point [1],[2].
The values ~β,
)/c. The terms
~Ec(t), ~H c(t) in Eq1 describe the sharply decreasing (∼ 1/R2) Coulomb ﬁeld of the particle, while ~Er(t)
and ~H r(t) are for the free electromagnetic ﬁeld radiated by the particle (∼ 1/R).

˙~β, ~n and R are to be evaluated at an earlier (retarded) moment t

′

= t − R(t

′

Usually the observation point is assumed to be far away from the region of particle acceleration, the
unit vector ~n is sensibly constant in time [1, 2]. The region of particle acceleration and emission is assumed
to have ﬁnite dimensions, and the radiation is observed from distances much larger than dimensions of the
emission region (in the far-zone or wave zone). The particle emits radiation within a ﬁnite time interval
determined by initial and ﬁnal moments ti, tf of particle acceleration. The energy of the emitted radiation
is ﬁnite.

The properties of the emitted radiation are deﬁned by the Fourier transform ~Er

ω of the electric ﬁeld

strength vector ~Er(t) of the form

For instance, the spectral-angular distribution of the energy radiated by a particle into the solid angle

(3)

According to Eq2 the properties of the emitted radiation are determined by the total trajectory of the
particle where the particle acceleration diﬀers from zero. This assertion is in accordance with the Fourier
transform of Eq2 for the time interval (−∞, +∞) or for the real case (ti, tf ) [6].

Notice that the Coulomb ﬁelds have longitudinal component and | ~H c| 6= | ~Ec| (| ~H r| = | ~Er|). These
are the reasons why the Fourier transform of the Coulomb and total electric and magnetic ﬁelds in
near zone could not be introduced and interpreted in a simple way. Only in the ultrarelativistic case,
where | ~H c| → | ~Ec|, the Fourier transform of the Coulomb ﬁeld is interpreted as the superposition of the
equivalent elementary waves corresponding to virtual quanta in the Weizsacker-Williams method. But
this is the approximate method used only for the case of homogeneously moving particles in empty space.
It describes well the bremsstrahlung radiation of electrons in the ﬁelds of relativistic ions [2]. In other
cases the accuracy of this method is not high. For example, when the relativistic particle crosses a plane
mirror it emits the transition radiation. We can say that in this case the properties of the transition
radiation are deﬁned by the properties of equivalent photons ”reﬂected” from the mirror. However, the
properties of the transition radiation are calculated precisely and they diﬀer from those calculated by the
method of equivalent photons. For instance, in the case of a perfect mirror the transition radiation ﬁelds
are included in the spherical layer of the thickness d → 0 (the layer contains the emitted radiation of
wavelengths λ ≫ d ). They are emitted from one point or from a very small region [2] (equivalent photons
would be reﬂected by the total surface of the mirror), and have a similar spectrum [7].

In some cases, the total ﬁelds (distorted Coulomb and radiation ﬁelds) of a particle must be taken into
account, e.g. a distortion of scattered particles ﬁelds can change the ionizing properties of the particles
[3]. At the same time, the inclusion of the Coulomb ﬁelds in the Fourier transform in some papers [8], [9],
[10] is not motivated and does not change essentially properties of the emitted radiation [11]. Of course,
the account of retarded Coulomb near-ﬁelds of high current beams in the storage rings [12], [13], [14], [15]
and in undulators of free-electron lasers [6], [16] is necessary to obtain the correct particle trajectories
and to calculate the total losses of the particle energy through coherent radiation [6].

The Fourier transform of the electric ﬁeld strength at zero frequency can be presented in the form
ω|ω=0 = (1/2π)~I r, where ~I r = R +∞
~Er(t)dt is the strange parameter of the wave. Waves with this
~Er
parameter ~I r 6= 0 were named strange waves. Strange waves have components of the electric ﬁeld strength
mainly of one sign. In particular, single-sign waves are the strange waves [3].

−∞

Strange waves transfer to a charged particle a momentum in the direction transverse to the wave
propagation. This property of strange waves contradicts to the common opinion that light pressure is
directed only in the direction of light propagation. The question appears:”Do the strange waves exist? Is
it possible to generate them?” The answer is not trivial.

When they say the word ”radiation” it usually means free electromagnetic waves described by a
homogeneous wave equation. The solution of this equation can be the arbitrary function of argument (~n ~R−
ct) [1, 2]. The word ”arbitrary” means that single-sign waves (strange waves) satisfy the homogeneous
wave equation in particular case. However, the existence of such solutions is a necessary but not a suﬃcient
condition for the existence of strange waves. What is the suﬃcient condition? To answer the question we
must solve the nonhomogeneous wave equation.

In the case of one particle the solution of the nonhomogeneous wave equation is described by the
Lienard-Wiechert ﬁelds of Eq1. Integration of the electric ﬁeld strength ~Er(t) determined by Eq1 leads
to the strange parameter of the free ﬁeld emitted by the particle

where subscripts 1, 2 relate to initial and ﬁnal electron velocities [3].

According to the Eq4 strange waves can be emitted only in the case when the initial and/or ﬁnal
velocities of the particle are not equal to zero and hence the particle trajectories are not limited. Unac-
ceptable conditions for particle trajectories exist for laboratory sources of strange waves as according to
these conditions the dimensions of such sources must be inﬁnitely large. It is possible to emit strange
waves in cosmos but impossible to emit them in installations of ﬁnite dimensions similar to lasers or
synchrotron radiation sources [3].

3 On the laboratory sources of the long wavelength radiation
based on the storage rings and accelerators

At present the high brilliance and high intensity broadband sources of both incoherent and coherent
infrared radiation are absent. The long wavelength part of the synchrotron and edge radiation [3] - [6]
emitted in the infrared region by particle beams in storage rings is increasingly used in diﬀerent ﬁelds of
science as an alternative for laboratory sources such as a mercury lamp or glowbar [17], [10]. Broadband
free-electron lasers of the coherent infrared radiation are developing [18], [19], [20].

The eﬃciency of emission of the synchrotron radiation in the long wavelength region in storage rings
and synchrotrons is increased when the value of the magnetic ﬁeld strength of their bending magnets
is decreased. Usually the value of the magnetic ﬁeld strength of bending magnets of storage rings is
high. That is why we can use special bending magnets installed in the straight sections of storage rings.

The value of their magnetic ﬁeld strengths have an optimum deﬁned by the equation eR Hdl ≃ 2mc2

corresponding to the bending angle of the particle in this magnets ≃ 2/γ, where the value 2mc2/e ≃ 3·103
Gs·cm and γ is the relativistic factor of the particle. First experiments conﬁrmed this statement [21].
The radiation from special bending magnets in such cases interferes with the edge radiation. As it turned
out, at optimal conditions of generation the magnetic ﬁeld introduced in the straight section must be
directed opposite to the guiding magnetic ﬁeld of the storage ring. In the general case, the system of
bending magnets installed in the straight sections of the storage rings can produce both linear and circular
polarized broadband radiation in the long wavelength region [4].

In the case of pure edge radiation (special bending magnets in the straight section of the storage ring
are absent) the components of the electric ﬁeld strength of each of the two wavepackets emitted in the edge
ﬁelds of the storage ring at the angle ∼ 1/γ to the direction of the axis of the storage ring have mainly
one sign. But signs of wavepacket components are opposite.
It means that every of the wavepackets
represents the strange wave radiation. Its spectrum does not tend to zero when ω → 0. However the sum
of the wavepackets is not the strange radiation because of the destructive interference. The lengths of
the wavepackets in this case are much less than the distance between them. The picture of the process in
space is similar to the case of an instant start and instant ﬁnish of a particle at the edges of the storage
ring. The edge radiation can be named ”conventionally strange” or ”quasiundulator” radiation [4] - [6]1.
The spectral-angular distribution of the edge radiation emitted in the long wavelength region λ > d/2γ 2
and under the condition when the observation point is localized at inﬁnity (condition when we can neglect
the diﬀerence between distances from edges of the synchrotron to the observation point) can be presented
in the form

where lef f is the eﬀective length of the straight section of the storage ring, l − lef f |H≫Hd ≃ 2d ln(H/Hd);
l, the geometrical length of the straight section, d, the gap of the bending magnet of the storage ring, H,
the value of the magnetic ﬁeld of the bending magnet of the storage ring, Hd = mc2/ed; m, the electron
mass, ϑ = γθ, ωl = 4γ 2c/lef f (1 + ϑ2), and θ, the angle between the axis of the straight section and the
direction from the synchrotron edge to the observation point localized at inﬁnity. The eﬀective length
lef f and the frequency ωl depend slightly on energy [4].

Spectrum of the edge radiation is shifted to the long wavelength region. In this case the spectral-
angular distribution of the radiation emitted at θ ∼ 1/γ is higher than that of the synchrotron radiation

1When the diﬀerence between the distances from the edges to the observation points are of the order of the eﬀective length
of the straight section of the storage ring then the strange parameter I r = |~I r| 6= 0 if we neglect boundary conditions. However
the windows of synchrotrons and mirrors of ﬁnite dimensions do not permit to transfer this radiation to the observation point
[3].

(for the same synchrotron) [7].

According to Eq5 the main part of the edge radiation energy is emitted throughout the angles ϑ ∼ 1.
At frequencies ω > ωl the spectrum oscillates with the period ωl and at frequencies ω < ωl it tends to
zero when the frequency tends to zero, which indicates that the wavepackets have opposite signs. This is
the so-called destructive interference of the wavepackets of the opposite signs ﬁrst discussed in the case
of transition radiation2[22].

4 Experimental arrangement

The experiments on generation of the long wavelength edge radiation were done on the weak-focusing
race-track electron synchrotron ”Pakhra”. The maximum energy of the synchrotron εmax = 1200M eV ,
the radius of the orbit of electrons in the bending magnets of the synchrotron r = 4m, the geometric
length of a straight section of the synchrotron l = 1.9m. The frequency of the guiding magnetic ﬁeld of
the synchrotron Ω/2π = 50 Hz.

The experimental setup of the ”Pakhra” synchrotron used in the recent experiment [23], [24] is similar
to that presented in [25]. The scheme of the experiment is shown in Fig.1, where l, lef f , the geometrical
and eﬀective lengths of the synchrotron straight section, R1 and R2 the distances from edges of the
synchrotron straight section to the observation point, θ1, θ2 the angles between the directions of the axis
of the synchrotron straight section and vectors directed from edges of storage rings to the observation
point.

The energy of electrons in the synchrotron was changed by the law εe = ε= + ε∼ cos(Ωt), where the
constant and alternating components of the energy ε= ≃ ε∼. The electron energy changed from minimal
εmin = ε= − ε∼ to a maximal εmax = ε= + ε∼. The maximal energy of the electrons in this experiment
was chosen 850 MeV (γ ≃ 1700).

The scheme of selection of the wavepacket emitted from one edge of the synchrotron by a lens having
the focusing distance f and located at the distance L from the right edge is shown in Fig.2. In two of
produced experiments, lef f ≃ 1.25 m and L = 1.875 m. The lens was installed at the window of the
synchrotron, photographic plate in the ﬁrst experiment and photomultiplier in the second were installed
at distance ∆R = 1.5 m from the lens. Filters at the wavelengths λ = 8400˚A and λ = 3850˚A and lenses
with focusing distances f = 1 m and f = 1.85 m were used in the ﬁrst and the second experiments.

The observation point in our experiments was localized at the distances R1 = 4.625 m and R2 = 3.375
m. The diﬀerence R1 − R2 = lef f = 1.25 m was about 3 times less than R1 and R2 and could therefor be
neglected in the experiments without the lens. In fact it could be taken into account by introducing in
Eq4 unit vectors ~n1 ~n2 and distances R1, R2 corresponding to the edges of the bending magnets of the
synchrotron [3]. The eﬀect of using of the lens is the higher the higher the diﬀerence between R1, R2 and
lef f .

5 Discussion

According to Eq4, the condition β1 = β2 = 0 for the electron trajectories in the synchrotron, and
the deﬁnition presented in the Introduction, the radiation emitted in the synchrotron is not the long
wavelength one. The radiation emitted from the central part of the bending magnet of the synchrotron in
the direction near to the direction of the electron velocity is a usual synchrotron radiation. In the direction
of the corresponding observation point this radiation is emitted mainly from the part of the trajectory
of the length ∼ lc = 2R/γ. The edge radiation is emitted from the adjoining edge regions of fringing
ﬁelds of bending magnets. In this case the components of the electric ﬁeld strength of the electromagnetic
waves emitted in the directions deﬁned by the angles θ ∼ 1/γ are the two short (ls ≪ lef f /γ 2) single-sign
wavepackets separated by the distance ∼ lef f /γ 2. Spectrum of the edge radiation determined by Eq5 is
shifted to the long wavelength region, as compared to synchrotron radiation spectrum.

If we could select the radiation emitted in one bending magnet from the radiation emitted in another
one then we could shift the emitted radiation in a longer wavelength region. And this is not the question
of the strange waves generation but the question of the spectrum shift3.

2The transition radiation emitted in the case of unlimited perfect plane mirror is the strange wave radiation.
3To reﬂect strange waves we need in perfect plane mirror of inﬁnitely large dimensions. The mirror of ﬁnite dimensions
can reﬂect radiation up to the wavelength λ ∼ a where a is the dimensions of the mirror. The window permit to transfer the

In the ﬁrst experiment the lens was not installed. No interference fringes were observed at a pho-
tographic plate similar to those observed in [22, 26] since the picture was averaged over time (energy).
When the lens was installed then the radiation emitted from the left edge was focused onto a small area at
the left side of the picture. The picture of the radiation focused by the lens is presented in Fig.3. Similar
picture was observed at the distance ∆R = 2.3 m from the lens where the radiation emitted from the
right edge of the synchrotron was focused onto a small area. So the radiation emitted in the region of one
edge of the synchrotron can be focused and hence selected by diaphragms from the radiation emitted in
the region of another edge. We did not observe any contribution of radiation emitted from central part
of the straight section of the storage ring and deﬁned by the Coulomb term of Eq1.

In the second experiment, the time dependence of the intensity of the emitted radiation was measured

by a photomultiplier and recorded by the oscillograph. This dependence is shown in Figs. 4 and 5.

The signal of Fig.4 corresponds to the case where the radiation is not focused by lens. In accordance
with the theory (see Eq5) the interference of the wavepackets emitted from edge regions of the synchrotron
leads to the energy dependence of the frequency ωl and intensity of the emitted radiation on energy and,
hence, time. This observation is conﬁrmed by Fig.4. The signal measured by the photomultiplier and
recorded by the oscillograph oscillates in time.

In Fig.5, the signal is caused by the radiation which is focused by a lens. We can see again that the lens
destroys the interference and selects the radiation emitted from the region of one edge of the synchrotron.
Selection of the radiation emitted in one edge of the bending magnet of the synchrotron permits one
to hope that the radiation emitted at the angles θ ∼ 1/γ to the axis of the synchrotron will be shifted to
the longer wavelength region.

It is impossible to focus the radiation at all frequencies by a glass or silicon lens. Metal concave mirror
can be used in optical, IR and submillimeter regions. Dimensions of windows of synchrotrons and storage
rings and dimensions of mirrors restrict the spectrum from the long wavelength region.

6 Conclusion

For the ﬁrst time, to our knowledge, the removal of the destructive interference in the edge radiation has
been demonstrated here experimentally. We can hope that the spectrum of the radiation emitted in the
angular region θ ∼ 1/γ to the axis of the straight section of the synchrotron was shifted to the more
longer wavelength region. This conclusion must be veriﬁed.

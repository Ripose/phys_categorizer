Abstract

The eﬀect of the electrodynamic forces on a charged particle in
a propagating plane electromagnetic wave is investigated. First it is
pointed out that for constant ﬁelds fulﬁlling the radiation condition
there will be an acceleration in the direction of the Poynting vector.
When oscillating ﬁelds are considered the Lorentz force on the particle
only causes a drift, with constant average velocity, in the direction
of propagation of the wave, i.e. the direction of the Poynting vector.
Finally, when the radiative reaction (radiation damping) force is added
the result is again an acceleration in the direction of wave propagation.

1 Introduction

Recently Professor Thomas Gold [1] has published a manuscript on the Web
stating that radiation pressure from the Sun does not exist, or at least that
it cannot be used for propulsion with solar sails, as has been suggested [2]. I
do not understand Gold’s, mainly thermodynamic, arguments but the phe-
nomenon of radiation pressure is well established theoretically and exper-
imentally so the manuscript is somewhat surprising. Usually the force of
radiation pressure is explained by discussing how photons carry momentum
which is either absorbed or reﬂected when impinging on a body. Here we will
point out and elucidate the less known fact that the electrodynamic forces
(Lorentz force and radiation damping force) on a charged particle from a
plane electromagnetic wave accelerates the particle in the direction of prop-
agation of the wave. This, at least, demonstrates that radiation pressure is
an immediate consequence of the relativistic equation of motion of a charged
particle in an electromagnetic ﬁeld.

For simplicity of notation we will use Gaussian units. The relativistic
equation of motion for a charged particle of charge q and mass m, in an
external electromagnetic ﬁeld Fab = (E, B) (with the notation of Landau
and Lifshitz [3]) is given by,

if we, for the time being, neglect radiative reaction. Here ua = (1/c)dxa/dτ =
γ(1, v/c) = (u0, u), where xa = (ct, r), and τ is proper time, dτ = γdt, and,
ﬁnally, γ = u0 = 1/
1 − v2/c2. Later we will add ga, the radiation damping
force, on the right hand side. This is a correction needed since an accelerated
charge radiates and this results in a reaction force. If one introduces the new
independent variable

q

one can write Eq. (1) in the form

2 Motion due to the Lorentz force of constant

ﬁelds

The general solution of Eq. (3) for constant electromagnetic ﬁelds Fab =
(E, B) is known and has been discussed extensively in the literature.
In
particular one can recommend the studies by Salingaros [4, 5]. Other illumi-
nating contributions are by Hyman [6] and by Mu˜nos [7].

First we note that the case of radiation is very special and diﬀers from
the general case. For constant E and B one can in general make a Lorentz
transformation to a reference frame in which these two vectors are parallel.
Then the Poynting vector,

which represents the ﬂux density of momentum in the electromagnetic ﬁeld,
becomes zero.
In that frame therefore there can be no radiation pressure
force. In such general ﬁelds charged particles will have a drift velocity equal
to the velocity of the frame in which the ﬁelds are parallel. Radiation ﬁelds
on the other hand are characterized by

S =

E × B,

c
4π

E · B = 0,
|E| = |B|,

and for such ﬁelds there is no such reference frame of zero Poynting vector.
The general solution of Eq. (3) for constant E and B fulﬁlling the radiation
conditions, for a particle starting at rest, is given by Salingaros [5] and is

u = ζE +

ζ 2E × B, γ = 1 +

ζ 2|E|2.

The meaning of this result is that, for small ζ the velocity will be essentially
parallel (or anti-parallel) to the electric ﬁeld as intuition demands, but for
large ζ the velocity will become more and more parallel (never anti-parallel)
to the Poynting vector S = (c/4π)E × B.

3 Motion due to the Lorentz force of of prop-

agating wave

The result (7) by Salingaros and its interpretation does not survive when the
ﬁeld is allowed to have an oscillatory time dependence, as we will now show.

respectively. We now specialize to the radiation case and chose the x-axis
in the direction of E so that E = E(ζ)ex. If also chose the z-axis as the
direction of the Poynting vector we must have B along the y-axis and of
the same length as E, so that B = E(ζ)ey. The Poynting vector is then
S = c

4π E2(ζ)ez, and the F-matrix is given by

(9), becomes

Thus, diﬀerentiating u with respect to ζ multiplies u with a matrix. The

To get an explicit solution we put

and use the series expansion of the exponential. For this we need the powers
of the matrix H and these are: H0

All higher powers of H are zero matrices. We thus ﬁnd that

If we take E(ζ) = const. we recover Salingaros’ solution (7).

If we instead assume that we have a simple harmonic wave, so that E(ζ) =
E1 cos(wζ) and f (ζ) = E1 sin(wζ)/w. We then ﬁnd that the time average of
the four velocity (18) becomes

The acceleration in the direction of the Poynting vector (the z-axis) that we
found in the case of constant ﬁelds has now become a drift with constant
average speed (originally calculated by McMillan [8]). The speed of this drift
is larger the smaller the frequency w is, but there is no acceleration and
thus no average force in the direction of the Poynting vector. For a recent
discussion of this problem, see McDonald and Shmakov [9].

4 The radiative reaction force from propagat-

ing plane wave

So far we have neglected the radiative reaction force and used the equation
of motion, Eq. (1). To make it more accurate we must add the four force ga
on the right hand side. Now we investigate the form of ga and how it will
modify the solutions found in the previous sections.

The origin of this force is the electromagnetic radiation that an acceler-
ated charged particle sends out. This radiation carries energy and momentum
and there is therefor a reaction force on the particle itself. One can show
2q2
that the force, due to dipole radiation, should be f =
3c3 ¨v. The four vec-
d2ua
tor form of this should give the four force ga
dτ 2 . A four force must
for kinematic reasons fulﬁll gaua = 0, the four scalar product with the four
velocity must be zero. This is achieved by modifying ga
0 by subtracting the
component along the four velocity: ga
0ub)ua. Since uaua = 1 this
gives the desired property. Finally one can insert the expression for d2ua
dτ 2
obtained by diﬀerentiating Eq. (1), and also the expression for dua
dτ , from the
same equation. The force ga should, after all, be a perturbation compared
to the Lorentz force. Thus one obtains

The corresponding three dimensional force f can be obtained by noting that,
with our conventions, ga = (γ/c)(f · v/c, f ).

Landau and Lifshitz [3] (§76, Problem 2) give the three dimensional form

(cid:16)

The ﬁrst term, f o, in line (23) is then of an oscillatory character. It can,

in fact, be combined with the Lorentz force,

and we see that the eﬀect of this term is to make a tiny time translation of

the Lorentz force with ǫt = 2

light to pass across the classical electron radius. This is unlikely to have any
noticeable physical eﬀects.

The essential radiation damping force is thus f s. All its terms (24) are
quadratic in the ﬁelds so there is hope that this force, f s, produces some net
work on the particle. In the rest frame (v = 0) we simply get,

f s(v = 0) =

q4
m2c4 E × B,

(27)

(28)

and therefore the particle starts to accelerate in the direction of the Poynting
vector. What happens when it picks up speed?

Assume that the ﬁeld is of the type in Eq. (11) with oscillatory E = E(ζ).
Since E = Eex, B = Eey, and E × B = E2ez, some algebra then shows
that our radiation reaction force, quadratic in the ﬁelds, is

f s =

We see that the eﬀect of this force is always to accelerate the particle in the
direction, ez, of the Ponting vector. The dissipative, −v, term is one order
higher in v/c and will thus only become important near relativistic speeds.
The force goes to zero when v → cez, but it does not change direction.

Surprisingly we ﬁnd that this force, which usually is called the radiation
damping force, does not damp anything in this case.
Instead its eﬀect is
the acceleration of a charged particle in the direction of propagation of a
travelling electromagnetic wave.

5 Conclusions

Above we have presented an elegant matrix method that yields an exact
solution for the motion of a particle in an electromagnetic radiation ﬁeld with

7

a given time dependence. This generalizes some older results for constant
ﬁelds of Salingaros [4, 5]. The concise explicit formula of Eq. (28) for the
radiation damping force in a plane wave might be also be a new contribution.
The main aim of this article has been to illuminate the way in which classical
electrodynamics leads to a pushing of charges along the direction of of wave
propagation.

Just as in solar sailing, this is a very small force, but in space where
there normally are no dissipative forces, even a small force can have very
large eﬀect in the long run. Note that there is no need for a force to be
stronger than gravity to accelerate things outwards from the sun (a common
misunderstanding). A typical object orbits the sun in a stationary ellipse.
When a small force is added this ellipse will gradually change, and with time,
these changes can become very large.

Abstract

We discuss a method to transform the covariant Fokker action into an implicit two-degree-

of-freedom Hamiltonian for the electromagnetic two-body problem with arbitrary masses. This

dynamical system appeared 100 years ago and it was popularized in the 1940’s by the still in-

complete Wheeler and Feynman program to quantize it as a means to overcome the divergencies

of perturbative QED. Our ﬁnite-dimensional implicit Hamiltonian is closed and involves no series

expansions. The Hamiltonian formalism is then used to motivate an EBK quantization based on

the classical trajectories with a non-perturbative formula that predicts energies free of inﬁnities.

INTRODUCTION

The usual Hamiltonian description of two-body dynamics is surprisingly restrictive within

relativity physics: If Lorentz transformations are to be represented by canonical transfor-

mations, only non-interacting two-body motion can be described. This is the content of the

no-interaction theorem of 1964, which later in 1984 was proved for the usual Lagrangian de-

scription as well [1]. A covariant version of Hamiltonian dynamics, constraint dynamics, was

invented to overcome this group-theoretical obstacle, but this too has limited applicability

[2]. In this work we start from a relativistic physical theory: the time-symmetric relativistic

action-at-a-distance electrodynamics, for which no constraint description exists at present.

We discuss the passage from the covariant Fokker Lagrangian to an implicit Hamiltonian

formalism deﬁned in closed form without power expansions. We derive a two-degree of free-

dom Hamiltonian for the electromagnetic two-body problem [3] with arbitrary masses and

with either repulsive or attractive interaction. In our description a Lorentz transformation

is represented by a canonical transformation followed by a rescaling of the evolution param-

eter. We use this covariant Hamiltonian formalism to motivate an EBK quantization of the

electromagnetic two-body problem that uses the classical trajectories to approximate the

quantum energies with a formula that is non-perturbative and free of inﬁnite quantities.

In 1903, Schwarzchild proposed a relativistic interaction between charges that was time

reversible precisely because it involved retarded and advanced interactions symmetrically

[4]. The same model reappeared in the 1920s in the work of Tetrode and Fokker [5] and it

ﬁnally became electromagnetic theory after Wheeler and Feynman showed that this direct-

interaction theory can describe all the classical electromagnetic phenomena (i.e. the classical

laws of Coulomb, Faraday, Amp`ere, and Biot-Savart) [6, 7].

In particular, Wheeler and

Feynman showed in 1945 that in the limit where the electron interacts with a completely

absorbing universe, the response of this universe to the electron’s ﬁeld is equivalent to

the local Lorentz-Dirac self-interaction theory [8] without the need of mass renormalization

[6]. Complete absorption is added to the theory as an approximation to uncouple away

from the detailed neutral-delay dynamics of the other charges of the universe. For other

approximations see Ref. [9]. The Wheeler and Feynman program [10] to quantize the action-

at-distance electrodynamics and overcome the inﬁnities of QED is still not implemented

because of the lack of a Hamiltonian description, which was a motivation for the present

2

work.

The relativistic action-at-a-distance electrodynamics is better regarded as a many-body

electromagnetic theory, once it is based on a parametrization-independent action involving

two-body interactions only, without the mediation by ﬁelds [6, 7]. The isolated electromag-

netic two-body problem, away from the other charges of the universe, is a time-reversible

dynamical system deﬁned by the action

−

not be restricted to a segment of trajectory going from an initial to a ﬁnal time, because

Lagrangian (1) at the end-points involves the future and past light-cones, which are out of the

segment. This diﬀerence from our Poincar´e-invariant Lagrangian to the usual Hamilton’s

principle of Galilei-invariant mechanics demands that action (1) be deﬁned by the whole

orbit. A sensible mathematical variation of Eq.(1) is along trajectory variations δxi(t) that

vanish at both t =

, such that δSF is a sensible ﬁnite quantity to be minimized. This

diﬀerence is discussed in [11], and we shall henceforth ignore it and derive our equations

of motion formally by extremizing action (1). The attractive two-body problem is deﬁned

by Eq.(1) with e1 =

Eq. (1) with e1 = e2

e. For the electromagnetic two-body problem with arbitrary masses

(Eq. (1)), the only known analytical solution is the circular orbit for the attractive problem

[12, 13]. A comprehensive discussion of literature on the Fokker Lagrangian is given in

Ref.

[3]. Some existence and uniqueness results for this two-body system are reviewed in

Appendix I.

This paper is divided as follows: In Section II we construct a Hamiltonian that is general

enough to describe the non-runaway solutions of the Fokker Lagrangian for the two-body

problem with arbitrary masses and with either attractive or repulsive interaction. In Section

III we use this Hamiltonian in an EBK quantization procedure that is non-perturbative and

can provide a set of energies free of inﬁnite quantities. In Section IV we put the discussions

and conclusion. In Appendix I we construct a Lorentz frame where a generic non-runaway

3

orbit of the Fokker Lagrangian is time-reversible (the CMF frame).

II. OUTLINE OF THE METHOD

The method to describe twice-monotonic orbits of the Fokker Lagrangian by an implicit

Hamiltonian formalism was discussed in Ref.

[3] for the special case of equal masses with

repulsive interaction.

In the following we generalize this result for the case of arbitrary

masses with either repulsive or attractive interaction.

The ﬁrst step of the method consists of a transformation to new variables [11]

This transformation splits the action integral (1) into the sum of two separate actions

ζ 2 take equal values ζ 1 = ζ 2 =ζ, and this ζ is the natural evolution parameter of action

Sa (henceforth called type a foliation). Analogously, for Eq. (5), integration over the δ

function produces a nonzero contribution only where ξ1 = ξ2 = ξ, and this ξ is the natural

time parameter of action Sb (henceforth called type b foliation). Notice that with type a

After expressing action (4) in terms of the time-like parameter ζ, the associated Euler-

Lagrange equation is a simple ordinary diﬀerential equation. The Euler-Lagrange problem

for action (5) is analogous, with ζ replaced by ξ. A Lagrangian (such as Eqs. (4) and (5)),

whose Euler-Lagrange equation is an ordinary diﬀerential equation is henceforth called to

be in the local form. Notice that Lagrangians (4) and (5) are also separately covariant.

The fact that the Fokker Lagrangian is not in the local form is a motivation to search for

an equivalent covariant and local Lagrangian, and the natural candidates would be Sa and

Sb of Eqs. (4) and (5). With that in mind, one could speculate if an orbit that extremizes

Eq. (1) could also extremize actions Sa (Eq. (4)) (δSa = 0) and Sb (Eq. (5)) (δSb = 0)

separately. Each separate minimization, in general, yields a diﬀerent trajectory, and as

discussed in [3], these trajectories are never equal. In Ref. [3] we found that the trajectories

of the following alternative pair of Lagrangians

(8)

(9)

(10)

and

δSa = δG,

δSb =

δG,

−

coincide for a choice of the Lagrangian G. A trajectory that satisﬁes Eqs. (8) and (9) will

also extremize the Fokker action (1), a simple consequence of Eqs. (3), (8) and (9):

δSF =

δSa +

δSb =

δG

δG = 0.

Our problem is then to ﬁx the Lagrangian G such that Eqs. (8) and (9) yield the same

trajectory and such that Eqs. (8) and (9) be ordinary diﬀerential equations (rather than

delay equations). Such G is henceforth called a bilocal ghost Lagrangian.

In Appendix I we prove that any non-runaway orbit of (1) has a Lorentz frame in

which it is time-reversible (henceforth called the CMF frame).

In the construction that

follows we operate on this CMF Lorentz frame. Since the orbit is time reversible, we can

restrict the minimization of Eqs. (8) and (9) to the set of time-reversible orbits ([x1(

t) =

−

5

x1(t)] and [x2(

t) = x2(t) ]). We also add the physical property that both advanced and

−

retarded distances decrease monotonically to a point of minimum and then start increasing

monotonically again. We henceforth call this set of orbits the CMF set. The piecewise

monotonic property is a consequence of the velocity being a monotonic function of time,

which was proved in Appendix 1 of Ref.

[3] for the repulsive case. The generalization to

the attractive case along symmetric orbits is trivial. We henceforth refer to a CMF orbit

simply as a twice-monotonic orbit. Assuming that a twice-monotonic and time-reversible

orbit exists in our given Lorentz frame, as this orbit extremizes Eq. (1) over all orbits, it is

necessarily an extremum inside the CMF set.

In the following we generalize some integral identities ﬁrst used in Ref.

[3] for CMF

orbits. The time-reversal operation maps type a parametrization onto type b and acts on

CMF orbits by the following map: ζ 1,2

ξ1,2 , ξ1,2

ζ 1,2, ra →

rb. The simplest type

of integral identity, valid for an arbitrary integrable function φ(x) of the real variable, is

φ(ra)dζ =

φ(rb)dξ.

Za

(11)

The lower index of the integral denotes the parametrization type, and Eq. (11) is a con-

sequence of the coordinate transformation induced by the time-reversal symmetry of the

CMF set ζ

ξ (the Jacobian of this transformation is one). For the attractive problem

→ −

we can restrict the integration to twice the ﬁnite interval between two consecutive collisions

(the period), while for the repulsive problem we must deﬁne the above integrals over the

inﬁnite interval.

In this work we ignore questions of convergence of the integrals, an am-

biguity inherited from the Wheeler-Feynman theory and discussed in Ref.

[11]. The same

time-reversal action (ζ 1,2

ξ1,2, ξ1,2

ζ 1,2) along CMF orbits generates the following

The dot over ξ1,2 in Eq. (14) indicates derivative respect to ζ ( the time-parameter of case a).

This G is in the local form when added to Sa , where ζ plays the role of the time parameter

identities allow us to express G as

which is also in the local form for action Sb, with ξ being the time parameter and the coor-

dinates being ζ 1 and ζ 2. Notice that the dot over ζ 1,2 in equation (15) indicates derivative

respect to ξ (the time-parameter of case b). Lagrangian (14) is the most general ghost

Lagrangian whose associated Hamiltonian involves quadratic rational functions of the mo-

menta, and we shall see that it suﬃces to describe any non-runaway orbit with two monotonic

branches.

The condition ˙r = 0 divides the phase space of a twice-monotonic orbit in two disjoint

regions according to whether ˙r > 0 or ˙r < 0 . In each disjoint region the Lagrangian has a

branch that can be uniquely inverted to a Hamiltonian formalism. To avoid the overloaded

notation of Ref.

[3], we henceforth drop all indications about branches. Notice that after

inclusion of the ghost Lagrangian, the problem δSa = δG of Eq. (8) implies the Euler-

only of ra, but nontrivial if V1 and V2 depend on E and P , as in the generalization that

follows. This generalization is necessary for the diﬀerent mass case.

As we show below, it is always possible to adjust the potentials such that Hamiltonians

(18) and (19) have a common trajectory. The drawback is that these so adjusted potentials

depend on E and P as well. This dependence suggests that we generalize the potentials

of Eqs.

(18) to functions of E and P [3]. For example, the potential φ(ra) should be

generalized to φ = φ(ra, Ea, Pa) in case a and to φ = φ(rb, Eb, Pb) in case b (an analogous

generalization goes for V1,2 and α1,2). The generalized Hamiltonian is still a function of phase

space, deﬁned implicitly by Eqs. (18) and (19), because E and P are functions of the phase

space. This generalization must be done carefully though, because in general the equations

of motion of Hamiltonians (18) and (19) with implicitly deﬁned potentials do not correspond

to the Lagrangian equations of (16) and (17) anymore, but rather to some highly involved

Lagrangian with a complex dependence on the velocities. On the other hand, simultaneous

minimization of a pair of Lagrangians with the simple form of (16) and (17) is very desirable,

because the Wheeler-Feynman equation of motion (δSF = 0 ) is then a consequence of Eq.

(10). In the following we construct a pair of auxiliary Lagrangians with the simple form (16)

and (17) for any given orbit. These auxiliary Lagrangians carry diﬀerent potential functions

for each orbit. All we need to know about these auxiliary Lagrangians is their existence,

8

as it guarantees that our orbit satisﬁes the Wheeler-Feynman equation of motion by means

of Eq. (10).

The auxiliary Lagrangian is constructed from the potential functions of (r, P, E) as fol-

lows: For an orbit of energy Eo and momentum Po, we deﬁne auxiliary ﬁxed form potentials:
φ∗(r) = φ(r, Eo, Po); V ∗

1,2(r) = α1,2(r, Eo, Po), which in turn deﬁne
auxiliary Lagrangians by Eqs. (16) and (17). The orbit of the auxiliary Lagrangian (16)

1,2(r) = V1,2(r, Eo, Po); α∗

satisﬁes the auxiliary Hamiltonian equation of motion deﬁned by Eq. (18) with the ﬁxed

form potentials. This equation is in general diﬀerent from the Hamiltonian equation of

Eq. (18) with the implicit potentials. To ﬁx this, we construct the potentials such that

both equations are equal in each case. For this it is suﬃcient to supplement the following

conditions in case a

(22)

(23)

(25)

(26)

and analogously in case b

∂Hb(p, Pb, r, Eb)

These are four conditions imposed on the ﬁve potentials φ, V1,2 and α1,2. Before we proceed

to construct potentials satisfying the above conditions, it is convenient to ﬁnd the explicit

solution of Hamiltonian (18), which is accomplished by use of a canonical transformation

with a generating function S given by

S = P X + W (x, P, E)

Eζ,

−

where W (x, P, E) is deﬁned to satisfy the condition p = ∂W/∂x , with p given by Eq. (21).

The new momentum associated with the old variable X is the same old constant P = ∂S/∂X

and the other new momentum is the energy E (with this last deﬁnition we exploit the fact

that E is already one argument of the implicit potentials). We choose S in the manner

of Hamilton-Jacobi such that the new Hamiltonian vanishes: K = H + ∂S

∂ζ = 0. As the

Hamiltonian is zero, the new coordinates are deﬁned simply by two constants X0 and C0

Now that we have solved simultaneously all conditions (22), (24), (31), (32) and (35)-(40),

some remarks are in order:

(i) To see the generality of our method, we can start from a numerical solution of the

delay equation of motion, with energy E, and simply adjust the two arbitrary functions

s(E, P, r) and F (E, P, r) such that Hamiltonian (18) has this orbit as solution. This can be

done with Eqs. (33) and (34) and takes exactly two functions, to describe the two particle

positions as a function of the light-cone separation. The method has a branch point at s = 0,

such that for each separation there should be two values for the position, one in the inbound

ﬂight and another in the outbound ﬂight, such that we can describe twice-monotonic orbits

only. A general proof of the twice-monotonic property is given in Appendix A of Ref. [3].

At the moment the only available method to solve the delay equations of motion is by

numerical calculation. An automatic consequence of (37) and (38) is that the orbit also

saﬁsﬁes Hamitonian (19).

(ii) Condition (22) was used as an ingredient in obtaining Eqs. (33) and (34) of case a,

but we never forced it directly. An instructive direct check is to take the partial derivative

respect to E of the implicit energy equation (E = Ha(r, p, E, P ) ) deﬁned by Eq. (18),

together with substitution of the potentials of Eqs. (42) and use of Eq. (32). The result is

∂Ha/∂E = 0, and analogously for case b we obtain ∂Ha/∂E = 0, which are the upper lines

of (22) and (24). The lower lines of (22) and (24) are obtained in the same way, by taking

the derivatives of the implicit energy equation respect to P in each case.

12

(iii) After we determine s(E, P, r) and F (E, P, r) , substitution of E = Eo and P = Po

into the potentials produces auxiliary Lagrangians that have an orbit in common, precisely

because of (ii). And of course, if we did not know that yet, we would prove that this orbit

satisﬁes the Wheeler-Feynman equation of motion (δSF = 0), as a consequence of Eq. (10).

Last, as discussed in Ref.

[3], at the branch point s = 0 and r = ro the continuity

condition for the functions of Eqs. (42) and (43) calculates P as

that the twice-monotonic property is a Lorentz-invariant property, suggesting that there is

no obstacle to describe a CMF orbit in another Lorentz frame.

The Lorentz transformation acts on the coordinates of Hamiltonian (18) (the ξ1 and ξ2

deﬁned in Eq. ( 2 ) ) as a simple rescaling

frame by a Lagrangian ¯La of the form (16). To see how the potentials are transformed in

the new frame, we make use of the explicit solution (30) in both frames, together with the
condition that the new coordinates ¯x1a, ¯t1a, ¯x1b and ¯t1b must be the Lorentz transformed of

the CMF form of F (r) and a rescaling depending on the boost parameter.

It can be seen that the Lorentz transformation of Eqs. (46) is a canonical transformation

that scales the momenta with the inverse factor, ¯p1 = λap1 and ¯p2 = λap2, such that the

in a large portion of the orbit, such that Eq. (56) predicts F (r)

1. The main diﬀerence

from Coulombian orbits to our covariant orbits at shallow energies is at the collision, where

Coulombian orbits reach an inﬁnite velocity, while the relativistic motion saturates at the

speed of light. Disregarding the collision region, substitution of F (r) = 1 together with the

low-velocity approximation dζ

with the approximate formula (57) predicts the well known Balmer energy terms for the

one-dimensional Coulombian two-body system. The corrections can be evaluated using the

exact covariant formula (55) along the numerical orbits, as obtained in Ref.

[19] for the

equal-mass case. As discussed in Ref. [19] for the equal-mass problem[19], at the outbound

collision F (ra) is singular like 1/√r, and dζ = (1 + v1)dt

√2radra, which makes the inte-

≃

gral of (55) ﬁnite (actually, for the equal-mass case the collision does not even contribute to

the integral). The merit of this procedure is that it calculates a Lamb shift without inﬁnities,

which might prove useful for understanding the renormalization of QED. For example, on

the equal-mass two-body problem, the orbits can be calculated numerically using the regular

delay equation developed in Ref. [19]. Along those regular collision orbits, there is nothing

inﬁnite involved in the evaluation of the action integral of Eq. (55) and the above covariant

EBK quantization procedure yields an electrodynamics free of inﬁnities for the positron-

ium atom (the quantum energies are all ﬁnite). It would be highly desirable to generalize

this procedure to the 3-dimensional motion of the electromagnetic two-body problem, but

at present we do not know how to do that. The EBK quantization of Wheeler-Feynman

theory is discussed in [23, 26] along with the only physical result so far (i.e. simple EBK

quantization of circular orbits). This quantization predicts energies with ﬁnite small shifts
in agreement with the Dirac equation to order α4 [26]. This is exactly what one expects

physically, as those are circular orbits with a ﬁnite angular momentum. The inﬁnite Lamb

shift plagues only zero angular-momentum states, which corresponds to the orbits studied

in the present work. The possibility of using the regularization of Ref. [19] to produce an

electrodynamics free of inﬁnities for the positronium atom suggests that further eﬀorts to

understand the regularization of the diﬀerent-mass electromagnetic two-body problem could

shine light on the renormalization of QED.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

The idea to remove the ﬁeld degrees of freedom from Maxwell’s electrodynamics goes

back to Dirac[8] and later Wheeler and Feynman planned to quantize WF2B as a means to

avoid the divergencies of QED, as in the action-at-a-distance theory the inﬁnite number of

ﬁeld degrees of freedom are absent. The diﬃculties in converting the Fokker Lagrangian (1)

16

to Hamiltonian form have caused the famous seminar that never came from Wheeler (see

[10], page 97). In chapter 5, page 97 of reference [10], Feynman says that ‘ I didn ’t solve it

either—a quantum theory of half-advanced half-retarded potentials—and I worked on it for

years... ’. This is still an outstanding problem today and the diﬃculties in casting relativistic

Lagrangian interactions into Hamiltonian form are explained in references [28, 29].

Our description does not violate the no-interaction theorem [1], and there are two places

where we avoid it: (i) the no-interaction theorem is an obstacle to covariant Hamiltonian

description of two interacting particles only in fully 3-dimensional motion. We are restricted

to 1-dimensional motion; (ii) Because the evolution parameter in our Hamiltonians is not

time but rather ζ for case a (and ξ for case b), the no-interaction theorem does not apply.

In principle, because time is not the evolution parameter, even in three dimensions the no-

interaction theorem would not be an obstacle to a Hamiltonian description, and that is an

open problem. The merit of our constructive approach is that it starts from the physical

theory of action-at-a-distance and does not involve expansions. This procedure should be

compared to the very interesting covariant extrapolation of Wheeler-Feynman theory within
constraint dynamics, which is a covariant way to introduce the correction of order (v/c)2 to

the Coulomb problem[27].

The energy equation for our Hamiltonian (18) is the following quadratic equation for p :

where m1a ≡

m1 + α1(r) , m2a ≡

along the orbit, but it would be desirable to extend these potentials to the whole phase

with some analytical continuation and/or use of symmetry. If that is accomplished, after a

symmetrization, Eq. (58) can be used in a quantum canonical formalism with p and P being

the quantum momentum operators. The trivial separation of the center-of-mass coordinate

X produces a familiar looking Schroedinger equation. This equation should be compared

17

to the one-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation, that has been studied in connection with

the one-dimensional hydrogen atom [25]. The quantization of the one-dimensional hydrogen

atom interacting with the electromagnetic ﬁelds is an interesting testbed problem, as the

minimal coupling to the electromagnetic ﬁeld produces divergencies in perturbation theory

that are exactly like in the 3-dimensional problem (and which are absent in the quantization

outlined above). In that respect, Eq. (58) is a properly renormalized version of the Coulomb

Hamiltonian operator.

Last, our procedure could be applied to the problem of calculating level shifts for an atom

in the presence of a strong gravitational ﬁeld, by incorporating the metric tensor gµν in the

deﬁnition of the variables of Eq. (2), which should be modiﬁed to ξ1

light-cone conditions

r(t) = x(t) + x(t

−

q(t) = x(t) + x(t + q).

In general, a neutral-delay equation such as Eq. (61) requires a pair of world-line segments

as the initial condition (one world-line segment for each particle). As discussed in Ref.

[14], the initial world-line segments can be provided in such a way that Eq.(61) is well-

posed by using ”maximal independent segments ”. A pair of world-line segments is called

independent if the end points of each segment lie on the forward and backward light-cones

of a single point interior to the other segment. A surprising existence theorem was proved

18

in Ref.([15]) for the problem of Eq.(61) along symmetric orbits [

x2(t) = x1(t)

x(t) ]

−

≡

using a Banach to Banach contraction mapping; This theorem states that for suﬃciently

low energies, Newtonian initial conditions [ x(0) = xo and v(0) = vo ] determine the unique

symmetric orbit that is globally deﬁned (i.e., that does not runaway at some point) [15].

Later in 1981 it was proved for this same equal- mass problem that the delay Eq. (61 ) is

equivalent to a local Newtonian equation [16].

The physical meaning of the above order-reduction of the delay equation is the following:

of the inﬁnite many initial conditions necessary to solve the delay equation of motion, only

the Newtonian type ”position and velocity values at t = 0 ” suﬃce to determine the non-

runaway orbit. The remaining conditions either take values determined by the initial position

and velocity or the orbit will be a run-away. The above existence/uniqueness results are

certainly true in the low-velocity Coulombian limit, as the Coulomb ODE’s have unique

solutions determined by initial position and velocity. Therefore the existence/uniqueness

result is either true in general or at least up to some high energy where strange new solutions

bifurcate out. In the following we use this Newtonian order-reduction to deﬁne the CMF

frame.

We consider here the two-body problem of Eq. (1) with attractive interaction and arbi-

trary masses. The construction of the Hamiltonian given in Section II for time-reversible

orbits can be generalized to arbitrary orbits if we are able to ﬁnd a Lorentz frame where

this generic non-runaway orbit is time-reversible. This frame is henceforth called the CMF

frame for the orbit. To accomplish this we start below by proving the following Lemma:

Lemma 1: Given any non-runaway orbit of Eq. (1), deﬁned in a given Lorentz frame, we

can construct another Lorentz frame where the two particles come to rest at the same time

(t = 0) along this orbit.

The proof will be given for the attractive case and we deﬁne the measure time such that

at t = 0 the particles are at the origin and moving in opposite directions with the speed of

light: x1(0) = x2(0) = 0, ˙x1(0) = 1 and ˙x2(0) =

1 (the outbound collision). As the force is

−

always attractive, the absolute velocity of each particle will decrease monotonically until it

comes to rest at some turning time, and then it accelerates again to the speed of light until

the next collision, that happens at a later time t = T (the inbound collision). At this second

collision the particles bounce at each other and start again with outbound velocities. The

19

proof can be made as well for the case where particles pass through each other at the inbound

collision, such that the orbit is twice as long. For simplicity we assume that they bounce,

such that the unit cell of our periodic orbit is the interval (0, T ), and particle one is always

on the right-hand side. The turning times of the particles are in general two diﬀerent values

in the interval (0, T ). To ﬁx that, we use a Lorentz transformation with boost parameter

w, deﬁned such that the transformed of events (t1, x1(t1)) and (t2, x2(t2)) be simultaneous

in the new frame. This imposes the condition

t1

wx1(t1) = t2

wx2(t2).

−

−

(63)

(64)

(65)

As we also want that both particles be at rest simultaneously in the new frame, we must

choose w such that

˙x1(t1) = ˙x2(t2) = w.

Because the velocities are monotonic in the interval (0, T ), condition (64) deﬁnes t2 as a one-

to-one function t2(t1) from the interval (0, T ) onto itself. We can then rewrite condition

(63) as the zero of a function of the variable t1 of the interval (0, T )

F (t1) = t1

t2(t1)

˙x1(t1)(x1(t1)

x2(t2)) = 0.

−

−

−

Using the facts that t2(t1 = 0) = T , ˙x1(0) = 1and t2(t1 = T ) = 0, ˙x1(T ) =

1, and also that

−

x1(t1)

x2(t2) > 0 for all times, we ﬁnd that the continuous function F (t1) is negative at

−

t1 = 0 and positive at t1 = T , such that it must have a root in the interval (0, T ). This value

of t1 calculates the boost w by Eq. (64) and deﬁnes a Lorentz frame where both particles

are at rest simultaneously (the CMF), as we wanted to demonstrate.

We have then constructed the CMF frame with the property that both particles have

zero velocity at the same time, say t = 0, which we can now use as ”Newtonian initial

conditions ”. As discussed above, position and velocity initial conditions determine a unique

non-runaway orbit, and since an initial condition with both particles simultaneously at rest

is invariant by time reversal, the unique orbit determined by it must be time-reversible.

We actually need the generalization of the Banach to Banach proof of Refs. ([15]) for the

20

attractive case with diﬀerent masses to complete our proof.

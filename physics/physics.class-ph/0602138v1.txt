A geometric view of the possible outcomes of elastic collisions of two massive bodies is developed
that integrates laboratory, center of mass, and relative body frames in a single diagram. From these
diagrams all the scattering properties of binary collisions can be obtained. The particular case of
gravitational scattering by a moving massive object corresponds to the slingshot maneuver, and its
maximum velocity is obtained.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The statement that two bodies collide means that for a
very short time δt in comparison to the ratio of character-
istic length scales and speeds, the forces due to gravita-
tional, electromagnetic, or any other interaction between
the two bodies dominate any external forces in causing
the momentum change ∆~pi of each of the bodies. This
implies that the impulse received from the external forces
by one body during the collision is negligible as compared
to the impulse contribution from the interaction forces
with the other body. This usually justiﬁes assuming con-
servation of the total linear momentum or center of mass
momentum of the two bodies during the collision. This
conservation however is an approximation. Indeed, since
the total change of momentum of the system is equal to
the total impulse received, although the internal forces
impulse must add to zero (because on the whole the inter-
action forces on the two bodies must be instantaneously
equal and opposite - Newton’s third law or weak action-
reaction law,) the external forces impulse remains, and it
need not be zero. This approximation becomes better as
δt → 0 or the external forces become weaker relative to
the internal interactions and is exact when there are no
external forces, in which case the center of mass momen-
tum is a constant of the motion. When the interactions
are conservative, the total mechanical energy is conserved
during the collision, which leads to the assumption that
the total kinetic energy is conserved immediately before
and after the collision, that is when the interaction forces
are (and become again) negligible as compared to the ex-
ternal forces. This assumption is also an approximation,
which becomes asymptotically exact when there are no
external forces. When the interaction forces are central,
the total angular momentum is also conserved in the col-
lision, under similar assumptions (strong action-reaction
law).

The usual treatment of the elastic collision of two
bodies of masses m1 and m2 with initial velocities ~v0
and ~u0 invokes conservation of linear momentum and ki-
netic energy in a one- or two-dimensional setting.1,2,3,4,5
Three-dimensional collisions are seldom addressed, but
see Ref. 6. The view from the initial (rest) frame of one
of the bodies is usually worked out and related to the
center of mass (CM) view of the collision. The latter is

particularly simple because the total linear momentum
~Pcm is always zero in this reference frame, which means
that

~v′

1 = −

0 = −

and ~v′

m2

i = ~vi − ~Vcm and ~u′

where ~v′
i = ~ui − ~Vcm. Equation (1)
means that the incoming velocities appear as collinear
opposing vectors in the CM frame and so do the outgo-
ing velocities. Conservation of kinetic energy is a scalar
equation which in the CM frame can be expressed as

FIG. 1: Laboratory and CM views of elastic collision between
diﬀerent mass bodies (m2 > m1) with initial velocities ~u0, ~v0.
When drawn from the same origin, ~Vcm and the resulting
velocities ~u1, ~v1 always lie on a straight line, the same as
with ~Vcm and ~u0, ~v0. Furthermore, ~v0, ~v1 are constrained to
a circle centered on ~Vcm, and so do ~u0, ~u1. ϕ′ is the scattering
angle in the CM frame and θ, ϕ represent u- and v-scattering
angles relative to the incoming velocity of the CM, viewed in
the rest frame of the u-body.

The resulting velocity directions remain however un-
deﬁned, so additional information is necessary to com-

pletely determine the velocities, for example, the scat-
tering angle with respect to a reference direction. For
a vector of given magnitude but unknown direction the
possible outcomes deﬁne the points on a circumference
centered on the origin. In the CM frame these vectors,
~v′
1 and ~u′
1, describe two circumferences whose diametri-
cally opposed points represent the possible outcomes for
the v-body and u-body velocities (see Fig. 1). To re-
turn to the laboratory frame it is necessary to add the
constant vector ~Vcm.

In the laboratory frame the following procedure can be
used to geometrically determine these outcomes. First
notice that ~v1 = ~v0 and ~u1 = ~u0 is also a possible solu-
tion, corresponding to a missed collision. Extending ~v0
and ~u0 from the origin deﬁnes points on two concentric
circumferences whose center is pointed to by extending
~Vcm from the origin; these three points are in a straight
line. These two circumferences deﬁne all the possible ve-
locities in the laboratory frame, and once the direction
of a resulting velocity is determined, then so is the other
by the collinearity of the three points (two on each cir-
cumference plus the center). The collision trapezoid in
velocity space referred to in many textbooks is obtained
in Fig. 1 by joining all the arrowheads.

These properties are well known and will not be dis-
cussed further.
Instead, we will develop an alternative
geometric interpretation to relate the laboratory view of
the collision, the CM view, and the view from the initial
reference frame of one of the bodies. This latter refer-
ence frame is more practical because it is asymptotically
coincident at t → −∞ with the non-inertial body frame
of the relative coordinates and velocities for which the
two-body problem for central forces is usually solved,
that is the frame in which the relative motion of the
two masses will appear as that of a single reduced mass
µ = m1m2/(m1 + m2), at the relative position of one of
the masses, moving under forces pointing to a ﬁxed to-
tal mass M = m1 + m2 at the frame’s origin, where the
other mass is at rest; this motion can be calculated for
suﬃciently well behaved forces. In particular, for a grav-
itational collision the result must be a hyperbola (unless
the asymptotic provisos made in the ﬁrst paragraph do
not apply, for example if the two bodies do not start or
end suﬃciently far apart, and then elliptic and parabolic
collisions should be considered).

(~v0 − ~v1) · (~v0 + ~v1) = ~u1 · ~u1.

We use Eq. (4a) to replace m1(~v0 − ~v1)/m2 by ~u1 on
the left-hand side of Eq. (4b), and ~u1 by m1(~v0 −~v1)/m2
on the right-hand side and obtain
m1

~u1 · (~v0 + ~v1) = ~u1 ·

(cid:17)

From Eq. (5) the unknown scalar product ~v1 · ~u1 can

be expressed in terms of ~v0 · ~u1 as
m1 − m2
m1 + m2
We take the scalar product of ~u1 with both sides of
Eq. (4a) and use Eq. (6) to obtain

~v1 · ~u1 =

~v0 · ~u1.

(6)

2m1
m1 + m2

~v0 · ~u1 = ~u1 · ~u1.

Equation (7) expresses the magnitude

u1 = |~u1| =

~u1 · ~u1

in terms of the unknown angle θ that ~u1 makes with ~v0.
We denote the outgoing direction of the u-body by

Then Eq. (7) is equivalent to

u1 =

2m1
m1 + m2
Apart from the unknown value of θ, the resulting u-body
velocity must be

~v0 · ˆuθ.

(10)

~u1 =

2m1
m1 + m2

v0 cos(θ)ˆuθ.

(11)

Equation (4a) can now be used to deduce an expression

for ~v1:

~v1 = ~v0 −

~u1,

m2
m1

(12)

or in terms of θ,

In a collision with a mass at rest at the origin, the
resulting trajectories lie on a plane in which the total
angular momentum ~L0 relative to the CM is orthogonal
to both ~v1 and ~u1 (strong action-reaction law).

In the frame where the u-body is initially at rest,
the relevant conservation equations for a collision with

~v1 = ~v0 −

m1 + m2

Equation (13) is not particularly illuminating with regard
to its geometrical relation to ~u1, so a more geometrical
approach will be adopted in Sec. II A for the determina-
tion of ~v1.

FIG. 2: Collision diagram for diﬀerent masses m1 > m2, u-body (mass m2) at rest ~u0 = 0. The circumference with diameter
~d = 2 ~Vcm is the locus of all possible outcomes ~u1. As chords of this circumference, ~u1 and ~d − ~u1 always subtend an angle π
2 .
A choice of θ determines ~u1 and ~n, which is always orthogonal to ~u1 and restricted to a circumference of diameter ~D = 2~v0.
The outcome velocity ~v1 is geometrically determined by ~n + ~u1 − ~v0 and lies on a circumference centered on ~Vcm with radius
|~v0 − ~Vcm|. In this diagram ~u ′
1 and ~v ′
1 represent the outcome velocities for the u- and v-bodies as seen from the CM frame, in
which incoming velocities would be − ~Vcm and ~v0 − ~Vcm respectively.

A. Geometrical view

Equation (17) means that the vector ~n given by

~n = ~v0 + ~v1 − ~u1,

~u1 · ~n = 0.

(18)

(19)

Equation (7) can be expressed in terms of the known

vector ~Vcm. We set

is always orthogonal to ~u1,

~d =

2m1
m1 + m2

~v0 = 2 ~Vcm,

(14)

(15)

and collect terms on the left-hand side using the fact that
~d · ~u1 = ~u1 · ~u1, or

We will show now that, just like ~u1, the vector ~n is
uniquely determined as soon as θ is given. The expression
for ~v1 will then also be determined from Eq. (18) as

(~d − ~u1) · ~u1 = 0,

~v1 = ~u1 − ~v0 + ~n.

(20)

that is, ~d − ~u1 is always orthogonal to ~u1.

Equation (15) shows that ~u1 is restricted to deﬁne a
chord from the origin to a point on the circumference
with ﬁxed diameter deﬁned by ~d (see Fig. 2).

The angle θ ∈ [−π/2, π/2] formed by ~u1 and ~v0 is the
same as the angle between ~u1 and ~d. Thus, ˆuθ is the
unit vector in the direction determined by θ, and for a
given choice of θ,

~u1 = d cos(θ) ˆuθ.

(16)

Given the geometric constraints on ~u1, we can determine
~v1 by substituting m1(~v0 − ~v1)/m2 for ~u1 on the left-
hand side of Eq. (4b). After rearranging terms we obtain

We use the orthogonality condition expressed by
Eq. (19) to cancel the right-hand side in the scalar prod-
uct of Eq. (4a) with ~n, and replace Eq. (20) on its left-
hand side to ﬁnd (m1/m2)~n · (~v0 − ~v1) = 0, or

~n · (2~v0 − ~n) = 0.

(21)

That is, ~n and ~D − ~n (where ~D = 2~v0) are always or-
thogonal. Similar to Eq. (15), Eq. (21) means that ~n is
restricted to deﬁne a chord from the origin to a point
on the circumference with ﬁxed diameter deﬁned by ~D.
Because ~n is orthogonal to ~u1, this condition deﬁnes a
unique chord that makes the angle φ = (π/2) − θ with
~v0. Its direction deﬁnes the unit vector ˆwθ, orthogonal
to ˆuθ, and therefore

~u1 · (~v0 + ~v1 − ~u1) = 0.

(17)

~n = 2v0 cos

− θ

ˆwθ = 2v0 sin(θ) ˆwθ.

FIG. 3: Collision diagram for equal masses m1 = m2, with the u-body (mass m2) at rest (~u0 = 0). The ~u1 and ~v1 circumferences
now coincide, and necessarily ~v1 || ~n ⊥ ~u1, that is θ + ϕ = π
2 .

We use Eqs. (22) and (11) for ~u1 and decompose ~v0 into

B. Scattering angles in the Laboratory (u-body)
and Center of Mass Frames

~v0 = v0(cos(θ)ˆuθ + sin(θ) ˆwθ),

so that Eq. (20) becomes

m1 + m2

h

~v1 = v0

cos(θ)ˆuθ + sin(θ) ˆwθ

.

(24)

The possible outcomes of ~v1 also have a geometrical locus
deﬁned by a circumference centered at

away from the origin, with radius

rv = |~v0 − ~Vcm| =

v0.

This radius is to be expected because ~v1 = ~v0, ~u1 =
0 is one possible result for the collision, meaning that
the closest approach of the two bodies was nonetheless
too far compared to the range of the interaction forces.
Conﬁrmation that in general the possible ~v1 deﬁne such
a circumference results from verifying the orthogonality
condition for two particular chords

(~v1 − ~v0) · [~v1 − ~v0 + 2(~v0 − ~Vcm)] = 0,

(27)

which holds when Eqs. (25), (20) and (4a) are used, to-
gether with the identities ~u1 · ~d = ~u1 · ~u1 and ~u1 · ~n = 0:

(28)

The scattering angles for the collision can now be de-
duced from the determining parameters. Relative to the
invariant direction ~Vcm of the CM, the ~u1 scattering is
simply the angle θ. The scattering angle ϕ between ~v1
and ~Vcm || ~v0 is then calculated from Eqs. (23) and (24)

The total scattering angle between ~u1 and ~v1 is obviuosly
θ + ϕ.

If m1 = m2, the identity (29) reduces to cos(ϕ) =

sin(θ), which means that ϕ = φ = (π/2) − θ and

~u1 · ~v1 = u1v1 cos(ϕ + θ) = 0.

(30)

Thus, if m1 = m2, the resulting velocities ~u1 and ~v1
are orthogonal and are both chords of the circumference
with diameter ~d = ~v0 (see Fig. 3). This orthogonality is
geometrically visible from Eq. (6), which in this equal-
mass case reduces to ~v1 · ~u1 = 0, indicating that the
solutions to the collision must remain orthogonal.

Note that if the angle ϕ is speciﬁed instead of the angle
θ, the determination of ~u1 is geometrically unique when
m1 < m2, but there is an ambiguity when m1 > m2
because there are two diﬀerent magnitudes for ~v1 with
the same ϕ, hence two diﬀerent angles θ. Direct inversion

If m1 < m2 the solution with the − sign is the correct
one. This solution can be argued by looking at the lim-
iting case of a missed collision (ϕ = 0) with the m2 body
at rest. In such a case θ is ill-deﬁned (because the m2
velocity remains zero), but we can see that in neighbor-
ing collision cases, the limit of θ as ϕ → ±0 is ±π/2, not
zero (see Fig. 4). Actually θ = 0 for a head-on collision,
and because m1 < m2 the outcome for ~v1 corresponds to
a back-scattering with ϕ = π.

If m1 > m2, real solutions exist only for ϕ ∈ [−ϕL, ϕL]
(indicating that there is no back-scattering in these
cases), where

The scattering angle ϕ for the v-body can also be re-
lated to the scattering angle ϕ′ as seen from the CM-
frame. We use ~v1 = ~v ′

and (26) and obtain

as before, that is, an elastic collision with a body initially
at rest. The same equations and conclusions are valid
except that everywhere we need to let ~vi → ~vi − ~u0,
~ui → ~ui − ~u0, and ~Vcm → ~Vcm − ~u0.

In this case the conservation equations are

m1
m2
Manipulation of Eqs. (40) in a manner similar to Sec. II
will generate the equivalent relations in this new frame
Su0 . Equation (7) now becomes

|~u1 − ~u0|2 =

(~v0 − ~u0) · (~u1 − ~u0).

(41)

2m1
m1 + m2

We set as before

~d = 2( ~Vcm − ~u0) =

2m1
m1 + m2

(~v0 − ~u0)

ˆuθ =

1
|~u1 − ~u0|

(~u1 − ~u0),

(42)

(43)

where ˆuθ is the direction of ~u1 − ~u0 and θ is the angle
between ~v0 − ~u0 and ~u1 − ~u0. Then

|~u1 − ~u0| = ~d · ˆuθ =

|~v0 − ~u0| cos(θ).

(44)

2m1
m1 + m2

Note that Eq. (41) is equivalent to

(~u1 − ~u0) · (~u1 − ~u0) = ~d · (~u1 − ~u0),

(45)

which means that

(~u1 − ~u0) · (~u1 − ~u0 − ~d) = 0.

(46)

As with Eq. (15), Eq. (46) states that ~u1−~u0 is restricted
to deﬁne a chord from the origin to a circumference of
diameter ~d. The ﬁnal expression for ~u1 is thus

~u1 = ~u0 +

|~v0 − ~u0| cos(θ)ˆuθ.

(47)

2m1
m1 + m2

The equivalent of the ~n vector in Eq. (18) is

~n = (~v0 − ~u0) + ~v1 − ~u1,

(48)

and its orthogonality to ~u1 − ~u0 remains

(~u1 − ~u0) · ~n = 0.

Therefore Eq. (21) becomes

~n · (2(~v0 − ~u0) − ~n) = 0,

(49)

(50)

and ~n is also restricted to deﬁne a chord from the origin
to a circumference of diameter ~D = 2(~v0 − ~u0). Thus
geometrically once ~u1 is deﬁned then so is ~n and Eq.
(48) yields the ﬁnal expression for ~v1 as

~v1 = ~n + ~u1 − (~v0 − ~u0).

(51)

In this general case the only invariant direction in the
collision is that of the center of mass.
It is left as an
exercise for the reader to derive a relation between θ, ϕ,
and ϕ′ in the u-body and CM frames and the scatter-
ing deviations from the center of mass direction of the
resulting ~u1, ~v1 velocities in the lab frame.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have shown how the relative velocities in a binary
elastic collision obey simple geometric relations even for
arbitrary masses and initial velocities, As can be seen
from Fig. 5, the possible ﬁnal velocities ~u1 and ~v1 for
given initial conditions lie on two concentric circumfer-
ences centered at a point in velocity space deﬁned by
~Vcm. The points deﬁned by ~u1, ~v1, and ~Vcm from the
origin always deﬁne a straight line. These circumferences
have radii

ru = |~u1 − ~Vcm| =

rv = |~v1 − ~Vcm| =

m1
m1 + m2
m2
m1 + m2

|~v0 − ~u0|

|~v0 − ~u0|,

(52a)

where ~v1 − ~u1 was replaced by ~v0 − ~u0 because, from
Eq. (51) and the orthogonality condition (50) (see Fig. 1),

|~v1 − ~u1|2 = ~n · (~n − 2(~v0 − ~u0)) + |~v0 − ~u0|2 = |~v0 − ~u0|2.
(53)
The maximum radius for either of these circumferences
is ri = |~v0 − ~u0|, which occurs when the respective i-
body mass is much smaller than the other, in which case
the latter circumference will have a vanishing diameter,
meaning that the velocity of the massive body is similar
to that of the center of mass itself. If, for instance, m1 ≫
m2, then ~Vcm ≈ ~v0 ≈ ~v1. In the limit m2/m1 → 0 then
rv → 0 and

ru =

m1
m1 + m2

|~v0 − ~u0| → |~v0 − ~u0|.

All the scattering properties for binary collisions can be

scattering or the existence of a maximum scattering angle
depends only on the condition rv ≷ ru. An interesting
exercise would be to derive the angular θ range for which
an increase in outgoing velocity is obtained for a binary
elastic collision with m1 < m2, ~u0 = 0.

One of us has written a Java application that renders
these collision diagrams interactively.7 The program uses
a Live Java library developed by Martin Kraus.8 Sim-
ulations reveal scattering situations that are not intu-
itively obvious but can be understood when the full two-
body motion is explored. In particular, by changing the
asymptotic angle θ and mass ratio m2/m1, we can obtain
the optimum incident condition for a gravity-assisted ﬂy-
by (or gravitational slingshot).9 It is then apparent that
the maximum velocity attainable by the smaller mass,
m1 < m2, in a collision is

v1, max = Vcm +

|~v0 − ~u0|

(55)

m2
m1 + m2

which occurs when both masses exit in the same direc-
tion as that of ~Vcm. As a consequence of Eq. (55), when
the massive body is initially at rest (or when the colli-
sion is viewed from its rest frame), the maximum velocity
attained is v1, max = v0.

In future work we will show that these collision dia-
grams are useful for calculating the eccentricities and fo-
cal distances for open Keplerian orbits for gravitational
scattering or repulsive Coulomb scattering. An explana-
tion of the slingshot maneuver and gravity-assist plane-
tary ﬂy-by can be easily obtained. In this way the orbits
can be viewed in the laboratory frame and a study can be
made of the optimal incidence angle for a planetary ﬂy-
by that delivers the maximum velocity boost in a chosen
direction.

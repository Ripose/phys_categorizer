Abstract

The classical electromagnetic interaction of a point charge and a magnet is discussed by ﬁrst

calculating the interaction of a point charge with a simple model magnetic moment and then

suggesting a multiparticle limit. The Darwin Lagrangian is used to analyze the electromagnetic

behavior of the model magnetic moment (composed of two oppositely charged particles of diﬀerent

mass in an initially circular Coulomb orbit) interacting with a passing point charge. Considerations

of force, energy, momentum, and center of energy are treated through second order in 1/c. The

changing magnetic moment is found to put a force back on a passing charge; this force is of order

1/c2 and depends upon the magnitude of the magnetic moment. The limit of a many-particle

magnet arranged as a toroid is discussed.

It is suggested that in the multiparticle limit, the

electric ﬁelds of the passing charge are screened out of the body of the magnet while the magnetic

ﬁelds of the passing charge penetrate into the body of the magnet. This is consistent with our

understanding of the penetration of electromagnetic velocity ﬁelds into ohmic conductors. The

proposed multiparticle limit is consistent with the conservation laws for energy and momentum, as

well as constant motion of the center of energy, and Newton’s third law for the net Lorentz forces on

the magnet and on the point charge. The work corresponds to a classical electromagnetic analysis

of the interaction which is basic to understanding the controversy over the Aharonov-Bohm and

Aharonov-Casher phase shifts and represents a refutation of the suggestions of Aharonov, Pearle,

and Vaidman.

INTRODUCTION

The interaction of a point charge and a magnet is a complicated and controversial prob-

lem of electromagnetism. The problem is ignored by the classical physics textbooks and is

discussed in the research literature in connection with the Shockley-James paradox,[1] and

in connection with the Aharonov-Bohm[2] and Aharonov-Casher[3] phase shifts for particles.

The problem in understanding arises because the interaction involves relativistic terms of

order 1/c2 (where c is the speed of light in vacuum) which are not nearly so familiar as

nonrelativistic mechanics. Writing regarding the interaction of a point charge and a magnet

in 1968, Coleman and Van Vleck remarked in an oft-cited article,[4] ”Unfortunately, the

equations which we have obtained are singularly resistant to a simple physical interpreta-

tion in terms of particles exchanging forces; ...” However, despite the complications and

in line with the controversy, the problem is an important one which reﬂects back on our

understanding of classical electromagnetism and on the connections between classical and

quantum physics.

II. THE PROBLEM AND THE CONTROVERSY

There are no electric or magnetic ﬁelds outside a long neutral solenoid or toroid when the

currents are maintained constant. Therefore when a charged particle passes a long solenoid

or a toroid, there are no electric or magnetic ﬁelds at the position of the passing charge due

to the unperturbed charge and current densities of the magnet. On the other hand, there are

clearly electric and magnetic ﬁelds due to the passing charge at the position of the magnet.

The electric ﬁelds of the passing charge will cause accelerations of the charges which carry

the currents which create the ﬂux of the magnet. Also, the magnetic ﬁelds of the passing

charge will cause a net Lorentz force on the magnet. Thus far the description would be

approved by all physicists. However, the response of the multiparticle magnet seems so

complicated that no one has calculated the magnet’s response in detail.

Since it does not seem possible at present to carry out a complete multiparticle calculation

starting from accepted theory, we are left with suggestive partial calculations and hence

with competing points of view depending upon which aspects of the partial calculations are

favored. At present, there are two competing interpretations for the behavior of a magnet

2

and a passing point charge.

1. The No-Velocity-Change Point of View

The supporters of the quantum topological view[2][3][5][6][7] of the Aharonov-Bohm phase

shift claim that there are no velocity changes for the interacting charged particle or the

magnet.

Indeed, the supporters of this view say that there are no signiﬁcant changes

in the charge or current densities in the magnet.

Therefore the passing charge never

experiences a Lorentz force and never changes velocity. Furthermore, although the magnet

does indeed experience a net Lorentz force due to the magnetic ﬁeld of the passing charge,

nevertheless the electric ﬁeld of the passing charge penetrates into the magnet giving a

”hidden momentum in magnets” whose change ”cancels” the net magnetic Lorentz force on

the magnet so that the center of energy of the magnet is never disturbed.

In this point of

view, the electromagnetic ﬁelds of the passing charge may cause confusion behind the scenes

inside the magnet, but there is no change in the magnet’s center of energy and there is no

feedback signal sent to the passing charge which is causing the confusion in the magnet.[8]

2. The Classical-Lag Point of View

The classical-lag point of view[9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16] takes a totally diﬀerent per-

spective on the changes in the charge and current densities induced in the magnet.

In this

view, the induced densities lead to a Lorentz force back on the passing charge which is equal

in magnitude and opposite in direction to the net magnetic Lorentz force which the magnetic

ﬁeld of the passing charge places on the magnet. The electric charges on the surface of the

magnet screen the electric ﬁeld of the passing charge out from the interior of the magnet,

and therefore there is no signiﬁcant change in the momentum of the electromagnetic ﬁelds.

On the other hand, the magnetic ﬁeld of the passing charge penetrates into the magnet,

and it is the magnetic energy change associated with the overlapping magnetic ﬁelds which

gives the magnitude of the energy change of the passing charge due to the back force. This

view ﬁts with what we know of the penetration of electric and magnetic velocity ﬁelds into

ohmic conductors. In this scenario, we have explicit ideas concerning conservation of energy,

linear momentum, and constant motion of the center of energy. We also have the validity of

3

Newton’s third law for the net Lorentz forces between the magnet and the passing charge.

Both points of view predict the Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher phase shifts. The

no-velocity-change point of view claims that, in the light of their interpretation, the phase

shifts represent completely new quantum topological eﬀects occurring in the absence of

classical forces, and there are no classical analogues. The classical-lag point of view claims

that the phase shifts present classical velocity shifts analogous to those occurring when only

one beam of light passes through a piece of glass before two coherent beams interfere. The

conﬂict between the two points of view has existed for thirty years without ever being put

to experimental test to determine whether or not there are velocity changes for the electrons

passing through a toroid or past a long solenoid. The no-velocity-change point of view

has been widely accepted because most physicists do not think of the possibility of induced

charge and current densities in magnets; they do consider induced charge densities only in

electrostatic situations. Furthermore, the proponents of the no-velocity-change point of

view have declared that the lag point of view is impossible because i) the electromagnetic

ﬁelds of the passing charge would not penetrate into a conductor surrounding a toroid or

solenoid, and ii) the back electric ﬁeld at the passing charge could not be of order 1/c2 and

proportional to the magnetic ﬂux of the magnet. The objection i) has been shown to be

groundless.[13] Magnetic velocity ﬁelds do indeed penetrate into good conductors in exactly

the required form which is completely diﬀerent from the exponential skin-depth form taken

by electromagnetic wave ﬁelds.[17]

The objection ii) is addressed in the present article.

In 1968 Coleman and Van Vleck[4]

discussed the interaction of a stationary point charge and a magnet using the Darwin La-

grangian. We will be following their approach in the following analysis. We will discuss

the interaction of a passing point charge and a magnetic moment where the magnetic mo-

ment is modeled as a classical hydrogen atom and where the electromagnetic interactions

are carried to order 1/c2 by using the Darwin Lagrangian. This is a well-deﬁned classical

electromagnetic system which is relativistic through order 1/c2.

In order to separate out

the electrostatic eﬀects (which are independent of the magnetic moment) from magnetic

eﬀects dependent upon the magnetic moment, we will sometimes average over atoms and

anti-atoms with the same magnetic moment. We will describe the motion and check all the

conservation laws. We will ﬁnd that in this case the induced currents are important and

that there are electric Lorentz forces back on the passing charge which indeed are of order

4

1/c2 and are proportional to the magnetic moment. There is also a displacement of the

center of energy of the magnetic moment. This behavior contradicts the suggestions of the

proponents of the no-velocity-change point of view.[5][6] Next we will discuss the passage

to the limit of a multiparticle magnet. Finally, in this multiparticle limit, we discuss the

conservation-law aspects which are mentioned above.

The Darwin Lagrangian accurately reﬂects the classical electromagnetic interaction of

charged particles through order 1/c2. To lowest order in 1/c2, the interaction among the

charges is given by the Coulomb force and the nonrelativistic form of Newton’s second law

F = ma. This 0-order behavior can then be inserted back into the equations of motion to

allow calculation of the higher-order corrections.

It is sometimes revealing to rewrite the Lagrangian equations of motion in terms of the

mechanical momentum

IV. TWO-PARTICLE MODEL FOR A MAGNETIC MOMENT

Our model for a magnetic moment will consist of two charge particles of diﬀerent mass in

Coulomb orbit around each other (a classical hydrogen atom). There is no electromagnetic

radiation in the Darwin Lagrangian, and thus the orbiting charges do not lose energy in

this 1/c2 approximation. Furthermore, for our model, we will average over the phases of

orbital motion and also average over the conﬁgurations where the both the charges and the

6

velocities of the charges are reversed in sign.

In this fashion one maintains the magnetic

moment behavior while averaging out the irrelevant electrostatic aspects.

In this article, the motion of the magnetic moment charges is considered extensively.

Therefore, for simplicity of notation (and in contrast to the notation of Coleman and Van

Vleck), the magnetic moment consists of a particle of charge e, small mass m, displacement

r, velocity v, and acceleration a in orbit around a massive particle of charge −e, mass M
(with M >> m), displacement R ∼= mr/M ∼= 0, velocity V ∼= mv/M, and acceleration
dV/dt. Since the mass M is large compared to m, the displacement R, velocity V, and

acceleration dV/dt are all small compared to r, v, and a respectively. The distant point

charge with which the magnetic moment interacts has charge q, mass mq, displacement rq,

velocity vq, and acceleration dvq/dt. Then from equations (4)-(7), our equations of motion

for the charge e in orbit, the massive particle −e, and the distant charge q are respectively

aspect which is crucial for understanding the electric forces which are proportional to the

magnetic moment.

1. Stable Electrostatic Polarizability

If the distant charge q lies along the axis perpendicular to the orbital motion and through

its center, −→µ ||rq, then the electric ﬁeld E(0)

q will cause a displacement l of the orbital plane

directions giving

mω2r = e2r (r2 + l2)−3/2

and

eE(0)

q = e2l (r2 + l2)−3/2

(18)

Eliminating r between the equations, we ﬁnd e2/(mω2)E(0)

q = el = p, where p is the average

electric dipole moment of the two-particle magnetic moment. Thus the magnetic moment

in this orientation has an electrostatic polarizability

α = e2/(mω2) where

polarizability is even in the charge e and in the frequency ω and has no relation to the sign

of the magnetic moment

q .[21]

the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector K for the Coulomb orbit of the charge e.[23] We assume
that the much larger mass M is at the origin, R ∼= 0, so that the charge e moves with a

see that the time rate of change of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector K does not average to

B. Electromagnetic Forces on the Distant Point Charge

1. Force Associated with the Stable Electrostatic Polarization

Having obtained the behavior of the magnetic moment in the 0-order nonrelativistic

system, we now wish to consider the electromagnetic forces Fon q=qEµ + q(vq/c) × Bµ acting
on the distant point charge q due to the magnetic moment −→µ . The forces are diﬀerent
depending upon the orientation of the magnetic moment. When the magnetic moment −→µ is
parallel to the displacement rq to the distant charge q, −→µ ||rq, then we saw in Eq. (19) that
−→p = αEq. Accordingly, the
the magnetic moment has an induced electric dipole moment
electrically polarized magnetic moment creates an electrostatic dipole ﬁeld Ep(rq, t) which

causes an electrostatic force Fon q on q given by

Fon q = qEp(rq, t) = q{2

−→p }r−3

q = q{2[e2/(mω2)]Eq(0, t)}r−3

q = −rqq2e2/(mω2r7
q )

(31)

The electrostatic force back at the charge q is independent of the sign of the charge q, or of

the sign of the charge e, or of the direction of rotation ω. When averaged over the orbital

12

motion and over both signs of charge ±e for the magnetic moment, the only force on q is

this electrostatic dipole force. There is no additional force of order 1/c2. As an aside, we
note that for this orientation of the magnetic moment, −→µ ||rq, the magnetic vector potential
Aµ vanishes along the axis through the magnetic moment parallel to the magnetic moment

direction.

2. Force Associated with Solem’s Unstable ”Strange” Polarization

The situation is completely diﬀerent when the magnetic moment is oriented perpendicular

to the displacement rq, −→µ ⊥rq.
for the magnetic moment, there were no electric monopole or dipole contributions to a force

In this case we saw that after carrying out the averaging

back on the point charge q. Since these 0-order back forces vanish, the back forces in order

1/c2 caused by the 0-order changes of the magnetic moment are of considerable interest.

The alteration in the shape of the Coulomb orbit leads to unbalanced accelerations a which

lead to new contributions to the electric ﬁeld according to Eq. (6). The vector potential

in the Coulomb gauge of a point charge e is given in Eq. (9), and we see that the last

term in Eq. (6) corresponds to the electric ﬁeld contribution from −∂ hAei /∂t = −∂Aµ/∂t.

Now the magnetic moment model corresponds to a magnetic moment given initially by
−→µ = e−→ω r2/(2c) in Eq. (20), and therefore to a vector potential

−→µ × r
cr3 =
Thus for our magnetic moment model, the average electric ﬁeld Eµ back at the charged

L × r

particle q will be related to the change in the angular momentum L of the orbit. Now the

change in angular momentum L of the orbit of the charge e is due solely to the presence of
the external charge q which gives dL/dt = r × eE(0)

q , and, when averaged over one period of

the motion, becomes from Eq. (24)

dL

= hri × eE(0)

q = −eE(0)

q × hri = −eE(0)

Now our magnetic moment model is initially in a circular orbit with K = 0, and K changed
as in Eq. (29) only because of the presence of the electric ﬁeld E(0)

q due to the distant charge

q. Thus the force Fon q on q due to the electric ﬁeld Eµ of the magnetic moment is

Fon q = qEµ(rq, t) = q

where E(0)
is the electrostatic ﬁeld in Eq. (17) of the distant charge q acting on the magnetic

moment. We notice that this force back on the charge q due to the magnetic moment −→µ
is proportional to q3e2µ; it changes sign with the external charge q, changes sign with the
magnetic moment −→µ , but does not depend upon the sign of the charge e. Furthermore it
changes sign with the reversal of the position rq of the charge q. Finally, it does not depend

upon any velocity of the charge q. It arises from the 0-order acceleration of the orbiting
magnetic moment charge due to the electrostatic ﬁeld E(0)
q

of the distant charge q. These

properties are in total contrast with those found for electrostatic forces such as in Eq. (31).

V. CONSERVATION LAWS

In our model, the (zero-order) electrostatic ﬁeld of the passing charge causes a change in

the magnetic moment which then produces an (order 1/c2) electric ﬁeld back at the position

of the passing charge. Since this back electric ﬁeld is unanticipated by treatments (such as

in the no-velocity-change point of view) which do not allow for changes in the charge and

current densities of magnetic moments, it seems appropriate to discuss all the conservation

laws associated with electromagnetic theory and to see how they are upheld by the present

model.

Here we have grouped the total momentum into three terms which can be assigned to the

magnetic moment, the electromagnetic ﬁelds between the magnetic moment and the charge

q, and the mechanical momentum of the passing charge q. When averaged over the orbital

motion of the magnetic moment, the system carries an average linear momentum in the

electromagnetic ﬁeld given by

from the other electromagnetic ﬁeld combination Eµ × Bq is very small since the magnetic
moment −→µ has no net charge.

Now the time derivative of the electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum hPem µqi in Eq. (37)

Thus the average electromagnetic linear momentum hPem µqi in Eq.
(37) changes with
respect to time for two reasons: the change in −→µ (due to the change in the orbital shape of
the magnetic moment) and the change in the separation rq. As the shape changes for the
orbit of the charge e in the magnetic moment, the magnetic moment −→µ changes creating an
electric ﬁeld at the position of the passing particle q. Thus due to this changing-µ eﬀect,

(42)

q
c

(cid:18)

the linear momentum hPem µqi in the electromagnetic ﬁeld decreases at the same rate that

the linear momentum of the point charge q increases due to the force from the electric ﬁeld

of the changing magnetic moment. The change in the electromagnetic linear momentum

hPem µqi due to the changing position rq is associated with the magnetic Lorentz forces on

the magnetic moment and on the passing charge.

Next we average the total system momentum in Eq. (36) over the orbital motion and

diﬀerentiate with respect to time to ﬁnd

the passing particle.

the magnetic ﬁeld hUem µqi changes because of the changing magnetic moment −→µ and also
due to the changing position rq of the passing charge q. Just as above in Eq. (41), the

changing magnetic moment is associated with an electric ﬁeld Eµ(rq, t) back at the passing

charge which changes the kinetic energy of the passing charge.

law, the changing magnetic ﬁeld energy hUem µqi is associated with the changing energy of

both the magnetic moment and the passing charge.

C. Center-of-Energy Motion for the Magnetic Moment

In this section we will discuss the motion of the center of energy of the magnetic moment

from two points of view. First we connect its motion to the motion of the passing charge

using the conservation law for the constant motion of the system center of energy. Second

we use the particle equations of motion to obtain what has been called ”the equation of

motion of the magnet,” referring to the center of energy motion of the magnetic moment

The Darwin Lagrangian gives constant velocity to the system center of energy to or-

der 1/c2, the same order to which the Darwin Lagrangian is invariant under Lorentz

transformations.[4] The center of energy

Thus the motions of the centers of energy of the magnetic moment and the passing charge

are coupled together. Our equations (52) and (53) here correspond to Eqs. (14) and (15)

in Coleman and Van Vleck’s discussion of the interaction of a point charge and a magnet.

The 0-order (nonrelativistic) linear momentum of the magnetic moment indeed vanishes since

the internal Coulomb forces within the magnetic moment satisfy Newton’s third law and

Eq. (17).

D. The Argument over Hidden Momentum in Magnets

Because the interaction of a magnet and a passing point charge is so poorly understood,

there can arise certain notions which are used as ”explanations” but are not explored in

detail. ”Hidden momentum in magnets” is such a notion. We will illustrate the situation

using our calculations for the interaction of a point charge and a hydrogen-atom magnetic

moment which we have calculated above.

Because the proponents of the no-velocity-change point of view are so sure that there is

no force back on a charged particle passing a magnet, they also feel sure that there must

be no change in the center of energy of the magnet. Thus if the center of energy of the

magnet did change position, then according to our Eq. (53) (and according to Coleman

21

and Van Vleck’s Eq. (15)), the passing charge must accelerate. Moreover, there is clearly

a possibility of acceleration for the magnet’s center of energy since there is an obvious
magnetic Lorentz force on the magnet given by Fon µ = ∇(−→µ · Bq). Now fundamental
classical theorems connect the force and changes in system momentum so that we must
have Fon µ = ∇(−→µ · Bq) = d hPµi /dt. But our equation (61) gives an escape from motion
for the center of energy of the magnet because there is a second term in the expression for the

acceleration of the center of energy. Thus the proponents of the no-velocity-change point of
view decide that the quantity −(1/c)−→µ × Eq represents a ”hidden momentum in magnets”
Indeed, a mechanical momentum of
whose change ”cancels” the classical applied force.

the required form is mentioned in a footnote in Coleman and Van Vleck’s work[4] and now

appears in an electromagnetism text book.[26] However, no one who speaks of ”hidden

momentum in magnets” has ever given any relativistic calculation which shows how this

momentum carries out this cancellation without continuing changes in the charge and current

densities of the magnet. ”Hidden momentum in magnets” (as used by the proponents of

the no-velocity-change point of view) seems to be an idea which exists simply to prevent

the motion of the center of energy of a magnet. As we see above in our explicit model of

a hydrogen-atom magnetic moment and a point charge, there is indeed a force back on the

passing charge and there is indeed motion of the center of energy of the magnet. Both of

these results are contrary to the claims of the proponents of the no-velocity-change point of

view.

VI. TRANSITION TO A MULTIPARTICLE MAGNET

Experimental observation of the interaction of a magnet and a point charge (such as

in the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift) involves not two-particle magnetic moments but rather

multiparticle magnets. We are interested in understanding the experimental situation based

upon the insight gained from the fundamental interaction involving a two-particle magnetic

dipole moment.

Within classical electromagnetism, the transition to a multiparticle system is most famil-

In our calculation above, we found that
iar for the electrostatics of polarizable particles.
our magnetic moment oriented in the direction of the displacement rq, −→µ ||rq, acted like a
polarizable particle producing a back force of magnitude Fon q = q2e2/(mω2r6
q ) back on the

22

point charge q. When the polarizability is larger (for example, m is smaller for ﬁxed ω), then

the force back on the distant charge is larger. Also, when we have many polarizable particles

present, the force back on the distant particle does not disappear but rather increases to a

well-deﬁned limit. Thus if we consider a dielectric wall formed by polarizable particles, then

the mutual interaction among the polarizable particles changes the functional dependence

of the force over toward Fon q = q2/(2rq)2, which holds for a conducting wall where the force

is independent of the polarizability in the limit of large polarizability. This occurs because

polarizable particles which are next to each other in the wall form electric dipole moments

which tend to cancel the external electric ﬁeld Eq at the position of the other electric dipoles

in the wall.

In an analogous fashion, we expect multiparticle interactions within a magnet to alter

the back force on a passing charge found in Eq. (35). We note that the force back at the

passing charge q due to our model magnetic moment can be varied by changing the mass of

the orbiting charge while keeping the magnetic moments ﬁxed. When the magnetic moment

involves a small mass m (and thus is easily inﬂuenced by the external electric ﬁeld Eq), the

force back at the passing charge is larger, just as is true for a polarizable particle in the elec-

trostatic situation. The most symmetrical multiparticle arrangement of magnetic moments

involves N magnetic moments arranged around a circle as a toroid with the distant charged

particle q located along the axis of the toroid. The 0-order (nonrelativistic) electrostatic
force on each of the orbiting charges of the toroid due to the charge q is eE(0)
q

just as before,

while the back force on the charge q is now N times as large. Again, in analogy with the

electrostatic situation, we expect that due to multiparticle interactions within the toroid the

back force on a passing charge will not disappear but rather will increase to a limit. Now

there will be nonrelativistic electrostatic forces between the charges of the N magnetic mo-

ments. Also, each of the orbiting charges e produces acceleration ﬁelds of order 1/c2 which

act on all of the other orbiting charges of the magnetic moment. Since the 1/c2-acceleration

ﬁelds act on each of the other orbiting charges of the toroid, the back force on each orbiting

charge e increases as the number N of two-particle magnetic moments increases. These

acceleration ﬁelds always cause forces such as to oppose any change in the currents of the

toroid. This corresponds to a self-inductance eﬀect which increases as N 2 when there are

N current-carrying loops.

It is important to notice that the present situation does not correspond to the elementary

23

mutual-inductance problem of electromagnetism texts.

In mutual inductance eﬀects, the

self-induced emf is such as to oppose any change in magnetic ﬂux introduced externally

and the magnitude of the back emf is independent of the current which is ﬂowing in the

toroid winding.

In our case here, the initial accelerations tending to change the magnetic

ﬂux through the toroid do not arise from any induced emf through the toroid. Indeed in

the limit vq = 0 there is no emf at all in the toroid. Furthermore, the back force on the

charge q does not behave as in Lenz’s law. Rather, the tendency to change the currents of

the toroid arises from Solem’s strange polarization associated with the electrostatic ﬁeld of

the external charge q treated as a uniform electric ﬁeld across each magnetic moment; the

change in the magnetic moment is proportional to the magnetic moment and changes sign

with the sign of q as seen in Eq. (35).

We expect that in the multiparticle limit, the electrostatic interactions within the toroid

will tend to screen the ﬁeld of the passing charge q out of the toroid and the back force on the

passing charge will be limited by the magnetic energy of interaction.

Indeed, calculations

for ohmic conductors suggest that the electric ﬁelds of a passing charge are screened out

of the body of the conductor by surface charges while the magnetic ﬁelds of the passing

charge penetrate into the body of the conductor.[17] We note that if the point charge is

held at rest outside a conductor, then the electric ﬁelds of the point charge are screened out

of the body of the conductor by surface charges.

If the charged particle is moving, we do

not expect this electric-ﬁeld screening to suddenly disappear. On the other hand, it has

been shown that magnetic ﬁelds due to moving charges penetrate into an ohmic conductor

giving a time-integral of the magnetic ﬁeld which is independent of the conductivity of the

materials.[17] As was suggested earlier, this is precisely the result which is needed to account

for the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift as a classical lag associated with energy-related classical

forces.[13]

A. Energy, Momentum, and Forces in the Multiparticle Limit

Let us now consider the momentum, energy, and forces when a charged particle q moves

with velocity vq down the axis of a magnet in the form of a toroid which is initially at

rest. The screening of the electric ﬁeld of the passing charge out of the body of the magnet

implies that the electric ﬁeld vanishes inside the toroid and therefore there is no signiﬁcant

24

contribution to momentum from the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the form Pem µq discussed above,

and no signiﬁcant energy ﬂow across the magnet.

It follows from Eq. (36), that now the

total system momentum consists of only two contributions, one each from the magnet and

the passing charge

While the electric velocity ﬁeld of a passing charge is screened out of a good conductor, the

magnetic ﬁeld penetrates into a good conductor with a time integral which is independent

just what was given for hUem µqi in Eq. (45). Let us assume that this magnetic ﬁeld energy

is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the passing charge due to the electric ﬁelds from

the changing charge and current densities of the magnet. Since the change in magnetic ﬁeld

energy is of order 1/c2, we need to consider only the nonrelativistic approximation to the

passing particle kinetic energy. Then we ﬁnd

where vq0 is the velocity of the charged particle q when far from the magnet where Aµ(rq)

mq∆vq = (q/c)Aµ(rq)

and the force on the passing charge is therefore

Fon q = mqdvq/dt = mqd(∆vq)/dt = (q/c) (vq · ∇q) Aµ(rq)

(70)

exactly as found in Eq. (66) from Newton’s third law. Thus there is a certain consistency

between our momentum and energy considerations. However, it should be noted that the

kinetic energy change for the passing charge is assumed to be of the same sign as the change

in energy of the magnetic ﬁeld. Energy conservation thus requires that the charges carrying

the currents of the toroid must absorb twice the kinetic energy change of the passing charge.

If the currents of the toroid act in a fashion analogous to a battery in magnetic systems

involving mechanical work, then such an energy balance is consistent with what is found

for familiar magnetic systems.[29] We note that the energy absorbed by the center of mass

motion of the magnet is of order 1/c4 and hence is negligible, since the recoil velocity of the

center of energy of the toroidal magnet (which was initially at rest) is of the order of 1/c2

from Eq. (65).

26

One should note the diﬀerence in perspectives between the analysis given here in the

classical-lag point of view and that suggested by proponents of the no-velocity-change point

of view (those who support the quantum topological interpretation of the Aharonov-Bohm

phase shift). It was pointed out by Coleman and Van Vleck,[4] and repeated above in Eq.

(53), that the accelerations of the centers of energy for the toroid and the passing charge

must be related as in Newton’s third law. We have assumed that the electric ﬁeld of the

passing charge is screened out of the magnet, have obtained the force on the passing charge

q by assuming that it is the third law partner of the usual magnetic Lorentz force on the

toroidal magnet, and then have shown that this force is directly related to the energy change

in the magnetic ﬁelds which penetrate into the magnet. The no-velocity-change point of

view claims that there is no force back on the passing charge, that the magnetic moment

of the magnet does not change, and that the changing electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum

is associated with ”hidden momentum in magnets” whose change ”cancels” the magnetic

Lorentz force on the magnet. This requires that the electric ﬁeld of the passing charge

should penetrate into the magnet so as to give the ”hidden momentum,” a penetration

which seems contrary to the screening of electric ﬁelds by conductors. Furthermore, this

point of view tells us nothing about magnetic energy changes between the passing charge

and a toroid.

VII. DISCUSSION

Although the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift is well known and is now standard in all the

recent quantum mechanics texts, most physicists seem unaware of the long-standing con-

troversy regarding the interpretation of the phase shift.

In 1959, Aharonov and Bohm[2]

solved the Schroedinger equation and predicted their phase shift. The phase shift has been

observed experimentally.[30] Aharonov and Bohm attracted attention to their phase shift

by claiming that their predicted phase shift occurred in the absence of classical electromag-

netic forces and velocity changes and represented a new quantum topological eﬀect with no

analogue in classical theory. There is no experimental evidence for this claim.

Indeed,

the interpretation has aroused controversy. Most of the initial controversy regarding the

Aharonov-Bohm phase shift centered on a distraction, whether or not the shift was caused

by stray magnetic ﬁelds outside the solenoid or toroid. This aspect of the controversy has

27

been removed by the toroidal experiments of Tonomura[31] which allow very little stray

magnetic ﬂux.

The suggestion that the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift might be based upon a classical lag

eﬀect involving classical electromagnetic forces and velocity changes (the suggestion repeated

here) depends upon our understanding of classical electromagnetism. The conventional

attitude regarding the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift is best stated by Aharonov, Pearle, and

Vaidman:[5] ”In the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect it is obvious that the electron is not subject to

any electromagnetic force, because the magnetic ﬁeld lies wholly within the ﬁlament and

so is zero at the electron’s location.” This naive statement omits the crucial possibility

of induced charge or current densities in the magnet leading to forces back on the passing

charge.

Indeed, induced currents do lead to forces back on passing charges; the phase shifts

may well arise from classical lag eﬀects.

In the 1970s, it was suggested that the possible inﬂuence of the electromagnetic ﬁelds of

the passing charge could be removed by surrounding the solenoid or toroid by a conductor

which would screen out the electromagnetic ﬁelds.[32] Experiment showed that the phase

shift persisted even when the solenoid was surrounded by a conductor.[31] However, it

was realized that although electric ﬁelds are indeed well screened by a conductor, magnetic

velocity ﬁelds penetrate into an ohmic conductor (and also into superconductors at high

frequencies) in a form which is completely diﬀerent from the skin-depth behavior of wave

ﬁelds, and indeed there is an invariant time integral which has precisely the correct form

to account for the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift as an energy-related lag eﬀect based on

classical forces.[17] The experiments to date do no not remove the possibility of a classical

electromagnetic basis for the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift.[13] In addition, it was pointed out

that electrostatic forces can give interference pattern shifts which take exactly the same form

as the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift.[10] Matteucci and Pozzi conﬁrmed this experimentally

in 1985.[33]

In 1984, Aharonov and Casher[3] suggested a second phase shift, this time for a magnetic

moment passing a line charge, which they claimed was the duel of the Aharonov-Bohm phase

shift and again occurred in the absence of classical forces and velocity changes. However, it

was pointed out that conventional classical electromagnetic theory clearly predicted a force

on a passing magnetic moment treated as a current loop, and Newton’s second law suggested

a lag eﬀect.[12] To counter this observation, Aharonov, Pearle and Vaidman[5] introduced a

28

new analysis for the interaction of a magnetic moment and a point charge, and claimed that

the magnetic moment, although indeed experiencing a net Lorentz force, nevertheless moved

as though it experienced no forces whatsoever, because of changes in ”hidden momentum in

magnets” cancelling the applied Lorentz force.

For the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift, the Aharonov-Casher phase shift, and the Shockley-

James paradox, the heart of the controversy and paradox involves the interaction between

a point charge and a magnetic moment through order 1/c2. Although the literature of the

Aharonov-Bohm phase shift is full of statements about the interaction which claim to exclude

any possibility of an explanation based upon classical electromagnetic forces[7], the claims

often depend upon nonrelativistic models[34] or point to familiar eﬀects, such as aspects of

mutual inductance, which indeed will not give the desired behavior,[35] but overlook the 0-

order forces on the charges of the magnet because the magnet is neutral. Coleman and Van

Vleck have treated the interaction consistently relativistically using the Darwin Lagrangian.

In the present work, we have followed the Darwin Lagrangian analysis. We have modeled

the magnetic moment as a classical hydrogen atom interacting with the passing charge

through the Darwin Lagrangian, and have noted particularly the nonrelativistic behavior of

the magnetic moment pointed out by Solem. The model is unambiguous in its prediction

of classical electromagnetic forces, energies, and changes of the center of energy.

It is

the 0-order accelerations which cause electric ﬁelds in order 1/c2 which act strongly on the

passing charge.

The transition to a multiparticle limit still allows ambiguities. However, the assump-

tion that in this limit the electric ﬁelds are screened out of the magnet while the magnetic

ﬁelds penetrate into the magnet both ﬁts with what is known for ohmic conductors and

also allows for a consistent treatment of the conservation laws of relativistic theory. The

discussion given here represents a refutation of the suggestions of Aharonov, Pearle, and

Vaidman regarding the role of ”hidden momentum in magnets” and conﬁrms the semiclassi-

cal calculations of both the Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher phase shifts based upon

classical lag eﬀects.[11][12] What is needed now are experiments to test whether or not

the Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher phase shifts occur in the presence or absence of

velocity changes for the passing particles.[36]

[30] The phase shift was ﬁrst observed by R. G. Chambers, ”Shift of an electron interference pattern

by enclosed magnetic ﬂux,” Phys. Rev. Lett. 5, 3-5 (1960). M. Peshkin and A. Tonomura in

ref. 7 give extensive references to the experimental tests.

Wave,” Phys. Rev. Lett. 56, 792-795 (1986).

[32] I proposed such experiments in preprints in the early 1970s and at a meeting with Professor

Moellenstedt in Tubingen during the summer of 1972. However, by the time my manuscripts

were accepted for publication in 1973, I realized that the penetration situation for electromag-

netic velocity ﬁelds was quite diﬀerent from that for wave ﬁelds.

especially Sec. V.

[35] The changing magnetic ﬂux through the magnetic moment (or toroid) due to the point charge’s

magnetic ﬁeld causes a back force which is of the order of 1/c4, (since it does not begin with

accelerations due to the Coulomb force), is independent of the magnetic moment of the toroid,

and (following Lenz’s law) is always such as to try to slow the charge. The force discussed

in Eq. (35) here is totally diﬀerent, always acting to both accelerate and decelerate the point

charge with the time order of the acceleration and deceleration depending upon the orientation

of the magnetic moment and the sign of the charge.

magnetic Lag Associated with the Aharonov-Bohm Phase Shift,” submitted for publication.

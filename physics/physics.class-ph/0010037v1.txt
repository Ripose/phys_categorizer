In our comment we show that the application of appropriated statistical methods to the
results of the author proves that the author in his article has not been able to reach his
goal.

In article [1] the results of a very interesting fundamental experiment are de-
scribed. The objective of the experiment is to statistically demonstrate that the
folowing equation is reliable

M =

Wi
Wk

(Torino) −

Wi
Wk

(Plateau Ros´a) 6= 0

where Wi and Wk are correspondingly the weights of samples of two materials of
diﬀerent chemical compositions, measured in the city of Torino (180m above sea
level) and in Plateau Ros´a (3480m above sea level). This would seriously question
the validity of the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP). Our purpose is to show that
the author has not been able to reach his goal in his article. With that purpose a
standart statistical processing of the author’s presented results has been completed
in [1], using the same symbols. The following relationships have been used [2-4]
(the letter “A” corresponds to Torino, the letter “B” corresponds to Plateau Ros´a):

∆W = q[SDA · t(P, n)]2 + ∆2

d;

∆(cid:20) Wi

Wk(cid:21) =

W k · ∆Wi + W i · ∆Wk

k

;

∆M = ∆(cid:20) Wi

Wk

(A)(cid:21) + ∆(cid:20) Wi

Wk

(B)(cid:21) ,

where ∆W is the experimental error of a series of measurements of the weight of
a sample under certain conditions; SDA is Standard Deviation Average for the
same weight; t(P ; n) it is the Student’s coeﬃcient to conﬁdence probability P and
number measurements n; ∆d is the scale error (∆d = 3 × 10−6
g); W is the average
of the corresponding sample weight; ∆M determines the limits of the conﬁdence
interval (M − ∆M , M + ∆M ). With probability P the exact value of magnitude
M is located within this interval.

¿From the results in [1] the accuracy with which the experiment should be carried
out is seen, it is comparable with the accuracy of a metrological experiment. For
following, in the statistical processing of the experimental data, the requirements
of a metrological experiment should be respected. For that reason, a level of the
conﬁdence probability P has been accepted as 0.999. On the other hand, the noted
conﬁdence probability is required for each experiment that aspires to demonstrate
invalidity in a fundamental physical principle. If the weight of a sample is measured
10 times in an experimental series and P = 0.999, the Student’s coeﬃcient is valued
as t(0.999, 10) = 4.78. There are two possibilities:

1. If the digit “0” is outside the conﬁdence interval, it can be conﬁrmed with a

probability of 0.999, that the exact value of magnitude M is diﬀerent from “0”.

2. If the digit 0 is inside the conﬁdence interval, nothing can be deduced.
The deviation limit ∆M , that is only due to the scale error ∆d, equals 4 ×
10−6. Because of this, there is no reason to consider those combinations of chemical
substances, where M ≤ 4 × 10−6, and only the cases where M > 4 × 10−6 will be
dealt with. In Table 1 magnitude M (calculated by M. Nanni), ∆M , the reliable
interval and the relative error for several chemical substance combinations have
been presented:

Table 1

It can be seen that digit “0” participates in all of the conﬁdence intervals. This
clearly indicates that magnitude M can be diﬀerent or equal to “0”. In Table 1 it
can be seen that the relative error for all of the combinations is bigger than 100%! In
this case the standard formulas should not be used for a normal distribution, instead

2

more general statistical formulas should be used. But this will considerably increase
the width of the conﬁdence interval. Finally, it is possible that some deviations of
the WEP exist. Regrettably, the author has not been able to demonstrate this
thesis in his article [1]. The results of the article can only justify the realization of
a new series of measurements with a more precise scale and/or a higher number of
the weight measurements for each sample, and a appropriate statistical processing.

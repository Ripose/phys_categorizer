The main features of radiation by relativistic electrons
are well approximated in the Weizs¨acker-Williams method of
virtual quanta. This method is most well-known for its appli-
cation to radiation during elementary particle collisions, but
is equally useful in describing “classical” radiation emitted
during the interaction of a single relativistic electron with an
extended system, such as synchrotron radiation, undulator
radiation, transition radiation and ˇCerenkov radiation.

I. THE WEIZS ¨ACKER-WILLIAMS

APPROXIMATION

Following an earlier argument of Fermi [1], Weizs¨acker
[2] and Williams [3] noted that the electromagnetic ﬁelds
of an electron in uniform relativistic motion are predomi-
nantly transverse, with E ≈ B (in Gaussian units). This
is very much like the ﬁelds of a plane wave, so one is led
to regard a fast electron as carrying with it a cloud of
virtual photons that it can shed (radiate) if perturbed.

The key feature of the frequency spectrum of the ﬁelds
can be estimated as follows. To an observer at rest at
distance b from the electron’s trajectory, the peak electric
ﬁeld is E = γe/b2, and the ﬁeld remains above half this
strength for time b/γc, so the frequency spectrum of this
pulse extends up to ωmax ≈ γc/b. The total energy of
the pulse (relevant to this observer) is U ≈ E 2Vol ≈
γ 2e2/b4 · b2 · b/γ ≈ γe2/b.

If the electron radiates all of this energy, the energy

spectrum would be

dU (ω)

dω

≈

U

ωmax

≈

e2

.

(1)

This result does not depend on the choice of impact pa-
rameter b, and is indeed of general validity (to within a
factor of ln γ). The number of photons nω of frequency
ω is thus

dnω =

dU (ω)

¯hω

≈

e2
¯hc

dω
ω

= α

dω
ω

,

(2)

where α = e2/¯hc ≈ 1/137 is the ﬁne structure constant.
The quick approximation (1)-(2) is not accurate at high
frequencies.
In general, additional physical arguments
are needed to identify the maximum frequency of its va-
lidity, called the characteristic or critical frequency ωC,

or equivalently, the minimum relevant impact parameter
bmin. A more detailed evaluation of the high-frequency
end of the virtual photon spectrum shows it to be [1–4]

dnω ≈ α

dω
ω

e−2ωbmin/γc

(high frequency).

(3)

From this, we see the general relation between the critical
frequency and the minimum impact parameter is

ωC ≈ γ

c

bmin

,

bmin ≈ γλC .

(4)

The characteristic angular spread θC of the radiation
pattern near the critical frequency can be estimated from
(4) by noting that the radiation is much like that of a
beam of light with waist bmin. Then, from the laws of
diﬀraction we conclude that

θC ≈

λC
bmin

≈

1
γ

.

(5)

This behavior is also expected in that a ray of light emit-
ted in the electron’s rest frame at 90◦ appears at angle
1/γ to the laboratory direction of the electron.

A. The Formation Length

To complete an application of the Weizs¨acker-Williams
method, we must also know over what time interval the
virtual photon cloud is shaken oﬀ the electron to be-
come the radiation detected in the laboratory. Intense
(and hence, physically interesting) radiation processes
are those in which the entire cloud of virtual photons is
emitted as rapidly as possible. This is usefully described
by the so-called formation time t0 and the corresponding
formation length L0 = vt0 where v ≈ c is the velocity of
the relativistic electron.

The formation length (time) is the distance (time) the
electron travels while a radiated wave advances one wave-
length λ ahead of the projection of the electron’s motion
onto the direction of observation. The wave takes on the
character of radiation that is no longer tied to its source
only after the formation time has elapsed. That is,

λ = ct0 − vt0 cos θ ≈ L0(1 − β cos θ) ≈ L0(cid:18) 1

2γ 2 +

θ2

2 (cid:19) ,

(6)

1

for radiation observed at angle θ to the electron’s trajec-
tory. Thus, the formation length is given by

L0 ≈

2λ

θ2 + 1/γ 2

(7)

If the frequency of the radiation is near the critical fre-
quency (4), then the radiated intensity is signiﬁcant only
for θ <

∼ θC ≈ 1/γ, and the formation length is

L0 ≈ γ 2λ

(λ ≈ λC ).

(8)

B. Summary of the Method

A relativistic electron carries with it a virtual photon
spectrum of α photons per unit frequency interval. When
radiation occurs, for whatever reason, the observed fre-
quency spectrum will closely follow this virtual spectrum.
The spectrum of radiated photons per unit path length
for intense processes is given by expressions (2)-(3) di-
vided by the formation length (7):

(ω < ωC),
(ω ≥ ωC).

(9)

Synchrotron radiation, undulator radiation, transition
radiation, and ˇCerenkov radiation are examples of pro-
cesses which can be described within the context of clas-
sical electromagnetism, but for which the Weizs¨acker-
Williams approximation is also suitable. ˇCerenkov ra-
diation and transition radiation are often thought of
as rather weak processes, but the Weizs¨acker-Williams
viewpoint indicates that they are actually as intense as
is possible for radiation by a single charge, in the sense
that the entire virtual photon cloud is liberated.

II. SYNCHROTRON RADIATION

Synchrotron radiation arises when a charge, usually
an electron, is deﬂected by a magnetic ﬁeld. For a large
enough region of uniform magnetic ﬁeld, the electron’s
trajectory would be circular. However, synchrotron radi-
ation as described below occurs whenever the magnetic
ﬁeld region is longer than a formation length. The radi-
ation observed when the magnetic ﬁeld extends for less
than a formation length has been discussed in ref. [5].

A. The Critical Frequency

Since ω0 = c/R is the angular velocity for particles with
velocity near the speed of light, synchrotron radiation
occurs at very high harmonics of this fundamental fre-
quency. The wavelength at the critical frequency is then

λC ≈

R
γ 3 .

(11)

For completeness, we sketch a well-known argument
leading to (10). The characteristic frequency ωC is the
reciprocal of the pulselength of the radiation from a single
electron according to an observer at rest in the lab. In
the case of motion in a circle, the electron emits a cone
of radiation of angular width θ = 1/γ according to (5)
that rotates with angular velocity ω = c/R. Light within
this cone reaches the ﬁxed observer during time interval
δt′ = θ/ω ≈ R/γc. However, this time interval measures
the retarded time t′ at the source, not the time t at the
observer. Both t and t′ are measured in the lab frame,
and are related by t′ = t − r/c where r is the distance
between the source and observer. When the source is
heading towards the observer, we have δr = −vδt′, so
δt = δt′(1 − v/c) ≈ δt′/2γ 2 ≈ R/γ 3c, from which (10)
follows.

B. The Formation Length

The formation length L0 introduced in eq. (7) applies
for radiation processes during which the electron moves
along a straight line, such as ˇCerenkov radiation and
transition radiation. But, synchrotron radiation occurs
when the electron moves in the arc of a circle of radius
R. During the formation time, the electron moves by
formation angle θ0 = L0/R with respect to the center
of the circle. We now reconsider the derivation of the
formation time, noting that while the electron moves on
the arc Rθ0 = vt0 of the circle, the radiation moves on
the chord 2R sin(θ0/2) ≈ Rθ0 − Rθ3

0/24. Hence,

λ = ct0 − chord ≈

≈ Rθ0(1 − β) +

≈

Rθ0
2γ 2 +

,

(12)

for radiation observed at small angles to the chord.

For wavelengths longer than λC , the formation angle
grows large compared to the characteristic angle θC ≈
1/γ, and the ﬁrst term of (12) can be neglected compared
to the second. In this case,

θ0 ≈ (cid:18) λ

R(cid:19)1/3

≈

1

γ (cid:18) λ

λC(cid:19)1/3

(λ ≥ λC ),

(13)

An important fact about synchrotron radiation is that
the frequency spectrum peaks near the critical frequency,
ωC , which depends on the radius R of curvature of the
electron’s trajectory, and on the Lorentz factor γ via

and

ωC ≈ γ 3 c
R

.

(10)

L0 ≈ R2/3λ1/3

2

≈ γ 2λC (cid:18) λ

λC(cid:19)1/3

(λ ≥ λC ),

(14)

using (11).

For λ > λC , the formation angle θ0(λ) can also be in-
terpreted as the characteristic angular width of the radi-
ation pattern at this wavelength. A result not deducible
from the simpliﬁed arguments given above is that for
λ > λC , the angular distribution of synchrotron radia-
tion falls oﬀ exponentially: dU (λ)/dΩ ∝ e−θ2/2θ2
0 . See,
for example, sec. 14.6 of [4].

For wavelengths less than λC , the formation length is
short, the formation angle is small, and the last term of
(12) can be neglected. Then, we ﬁnd that

L0 ≈ γ 2λ

(λ ≤ λC ),

(15)

the same as for motion along a straight line, eq. (8). It
follows that the formation angle L0/R is λ/γλC < 1/γ.
However, this formation angle cannot be interpreted as
the characteristic angular width of the radiation pattern,
which is found to be

θ0 ≈

1

γr λ

λC

(λ ≤ λC )

(16)

via more detailed analysis [4].

C. Transverse Coherence Length

The longitudinal origin of radiation is uncertain to
within one formation length L0. Over this length, the
trajectory of the electron is curved, so there is an uncer-
tainty in the transverse origin of the radiation as well.
A measure of the transverse uncertainty is the sagitta
L2
0/8R, which we label w0 anticipating a useful analogy
with the common notation for the waist of a focused laser
beam. For λ > λC , we have from (14),

w0 ≈

0

L2
R

≈ R1/3λ2/3

≈ γλC (cid:18) λ

λC(cid:19)2/3

(λ ≥ λC ).

(17)

For λ ≥ λC , the characteristic angular spread (13) of the
radiation obeys

θ0 ≈

λ
w0

,

(18)

consistent with the laws of diﬀraction. Hence, the dis-
tance w0 of (17) can also be called the transverse coher-
ence length [6] of the source of synchrotron radiation.

The analogy with laser notation is also consistent with
identifying the formation length L0 with the Rayleigh
range z0 = w0/θ0, since we see that

L0 ≈

λ
θ2

0

≈

w0
θ0

.

(19)

Note that the sagitta (17) is larger than the minimum
transverse length (4) for which the full virtual photon
cloud is shaken oﬀ.

3

We now return to the case of short wavelengths, λ <
λC . The diﬀraction law (18) must hold for a suitable
interpretation of θ0 as the characteristic angular spread,
and w0 as the minimum transverse extent of the radia-
tion. We deﬁne θ0 by eq. (16), in which case

w0 ≈ γr λC

λ

,

z0 =

w0
θ0

≈ γ 2λC = L0

λC
λ

,

(λ < λC ).

(20)

A subtle diﬀerence between the radiation of a relativis-
tic charge and a focused laser beam is that the laser beam
has a Guoy phase shift [7,8] between its waist and the far
ﬁeld, while radiation from a charge does not.

D. Frequency Spectrum

The number of photons radiated per unit path length
l during synchrotron radiation is obtained from the
Weizs¨acker-Williams spectrum (9) using eqs. (14) and
(15) for the formation length:

dnω
dl

≈ (cid:26) αdωe−ω/ωC /γ 2c
C dω/γ 2cω2/3

αω2/3

(λ ≤ λC ),
(λ ≥ λC ).

(21)

We multiply by ¯hω to recover the energy spectrum:

dU (ω)

dl

≈ (cid:26) e2ωdωe−ω/ωC /γ 2c2
C ω1/3dω/γ 2c2

e2ω2/3

(λ ≤ λC ),
(λ ≥ λC ).

(22)

The energy spectrum varies as ω1/3 at low frequencies.

The total radiated power is estimated from (22) using
ω ≈ dω ≈ ωC ≈ γ 3c/R, and multiplying by v ≈ c to
convert dl to dt:

dU
dt

≈

e2γ 4c
R2 .

(23)

This result is also obtained from the Larmor formula,
dU/dt = 2e2a⋆2/3c2, where the rest-frame acceleration is
given by a⋆ = γ 2a = γ 2v2/R ≈ γ 2c2/R in terms of lab
quantities.

III. UNDULATOR RADIATION

An undulator is a device that creates a region of trans-
verse magnetic ﬁeld that whose magnitude oscillates with
spatial period λ0. This ﬁeld is constant in time, and is
usually lies in a transverse plane (although helical undu-
lators have been built, and are actually somewhat easily
to analyze). As an electron with velocity v traverses the
undulator, its trajectory involves transverse oscillations
with laboratory wavelength λ0, and laboratory frequency
ω0 = c/λ0. The oscillating electron then emits undulator
radiation.

This radiation is usefully described by ﬁrst transform-
ing to the average rest frame of the electron, which is

done by a Lorentz boost of γ = 1/p1 − (v/c)2 in the

ﬁrst approximation. The undulator wavelength in this
frame is λ⋆ = λ0/γ, and the frequency of the oscilla-
tor is ω⋆ = γω0. The electron emits dipole radiation at
this frequency in its average rest frame. The laboratory
radiation is the transform of this radiation.

Thus, undulator radiation is readily discussed as the
Lorentz transform of a Hertzian dipole oscillator, and the
Weizs¨acker-Williams approximation does not oﬀer much
practical advantage here. However, an analysis of un-
dulator radiation can validate the Weizs¨acker-Williams
approximation, while also exploring the distinction be-
tween undulator radiation and wiggler radiation.

(29)

using (24).

This estimate proves to be reasonable only for that part
of the range of undulator parameters. To clarify this, we
need to examine the electron’s trajectory through the
undulator in greater detail.

A. A First Estimate

B. Details of the Electron’s Trajectory

The characteristic angle of undulator radiation in the
laboratory is θC ≈ 1/γ, this being the transform of a ray
at θ⋆ = 90◦ to the electron’s lab velocity. The radiation
is nearly monochromatic, with frequency

ωC ≈ 2γω⋆ = 2γ 2ω0,

and wavelength

λC ≈

λ0
2γ 2 .

(24)

(25)

The formation length, deﬁned as the distance over
which radiation pulls one wavelength ahead of the elec-
tron, is L0 ≈ γ 2λ ≈ λ0, the undulator period. But when
the electron advances one period, it continues to oscillate,
and the amplitude of the radiation emitted during the
second period is in phase with that of the ﬁrst. Assum-
ing that the radiation from successive period overlaps in
space, there will be constructive interference which con-
tinues over the entire length of the undulator.
In this
case, the radiation is not clearly distinct from the near
zone of the electron until it leaves the undulator. Hence,
the formation length of undulator radiation is better de-
ﬁned as

L0 = N0λ0,

(26)

where N0 is the number of periods in the undulator.

The frequency spread of undulator radiation narrows

as the number of undulator periods increases, and

and

∆ω
ωC

≈

1
N0

(27)

We now try to deduce the radiated photon spectrum
from the Weizs¨acker-Williams approximation (9). The
constructive interference over the N0 undulator periods
implies that the radiated energy will be N 2
0 times that if
there were only one period. So we multiply (9) to obtain

A magnetic ﬁeld changes the direction of the electron’s
velocity, but not its magnitude. As a result of the trans-
verse oscillation in the undulator, the electron’s average
forward velocity v will be less than v. The boost to the
average rest frame is described by γ rather than γ.

In the average rest frame, the electron is not at rest,
but oscillates in the electric and magnetic ﬁelds ˜E ≈
˜B = γB0, where we use the symbol ˜ to indicate quan-
tities in the average rest frame. The case of a helical
undulator is actually simpler than that of a linear one.
For a helical undulator, the average-rest-frame ﬁelds are
essentially those of circularly polarized light of frequency
˜ω = γω0. The electron moves in a circle of radius R at
this frequency, in phase with the electric ﬁeld ˜E, and with
velocity ˜v and associated Lorentz factor ˜γ, all related by

˜γm˜v2

R

= ˜γm˜v ˜ω = e ˜E.

From this we learn that

˜γ ˜β =

e ˜E
m˜ωc

≈

eB0
mω0c

≡ η,

and hence,

(30)

(31)

˜γ = p1 + η2,

˜β =

η

p1 + η2

,

(32)

R =

˜βc
˜ω

=

η˜λ

ηλ0

=

p1 + η2

γp1 + η2

(33)

Thus, the dimensionless parameter η describes many
features of the transverse motion of an electron in an
oscillatory ﬁeld. It is actually a Lorentz invariant, being
proportional to the magnitude of the 4-vector potential.

For a linear undulator, η is usefully deﬁned as

η =

eB0,rms
mω0c

,

(34)

4

where the root-mean-square (rms) average is taken over
one period. With the deﬁnition (34), the rms values of
˜β, ˜γ and R for a linear undulator of strength η are also
given by eqs. (32)-(33).

We can now display a relation for γ, by noting that
in the average rest frame the electron’s (average) energy

is ˜γmc2 = mp1 + η2c2, while its average momentum is

zero there. Hence, on transforming back to the lab frame,
we have γmc2 = γ˜γmc2, and so

R ≈ ηbmin.

(40)

Thus, for η less than one, the undulator radiation will
be less than full strength. We readily expect that the
intensity of weak radiation varies as the square of the
amplitude of the motion, so the estimate (29) should be
revised as

dU
dt

≈

η2e2cγ 2

λ2

0

,

(η <

∼ 1).

(41)

.

(35)

The radiated power can be calculated exactly via the

Larmor formula,

dU
dt

=

2e2a⋆2

3c3

,

(42)

where a⋆ = eE⋆/m is the acceleration of the electron in
its instantaneous rest frame. The electron is moving in a
helix with its velocity perpendicular to B0, so the electric
ﬁeld in the instantaneous rest frame is E⋆ = γβB0 ≈
γB0. Hence,

dU
dt

≈

2e2γ 2

mc (cid:19)2
3c (cid:18) eB0

=

2e2cγ 2η2

3λ2

0

,

(43)

in agreement with the revised estimate (41).

In practice, η ≈ 1 is the region of greatest interest as it
provides the maximum amount of constructive undulator
radiation.

IV. TRANSITION RADIATION

As a charged particle crosses,

for example, a vac-
uum/metal boundary, its interaction with charges in the
material results in an acceleration and hence radiation,
commonly called transition radiation. The formation
length is given by (7), and a formation length extends
from each boundary. Hence, the number of photons emit-
ted per boundary is therefore given by (2) as α per unit
frequency interval.

The minimum relevant transverse scale, bmin, is the
plasma wavelength λp = c/ωp, so the critical frequency
is ωC ≈ γωp, according to (4). This is well into the x-ray
regime. If the boundaries are less than a formation length
apart, interesting interference eﬀects arise. While the
characteristic angle of transition radiation is 1/γ, there
is only a power-law falloﬀ at larger angles, and the optical
transition radiation from an intense beam of electrons can
be used to measure the spot size to accuracy of a few λ
[9,10].

V. ˇCERENKOV RADIATION

In the case of ˇCerenkov radiation, the charge moves
with velocity v > c/n in a medium where n(λ) is the
index of refraction. The radiation is emitted in a cone of

γ =

γ

p1 + η2

The transverse amplitude of the motion is obtained

from (33) and (35):

R =

ηλ0
γ

.

C. η > 1: Wiggler Radiation

The pitch angle of the helical trajectory is

θ ≈ tan θ =

R
λ0

=

η
γ

.

(36)

(37)

Since the characteristic angle of the radiation is θC ≈
1/γ, we see that the radiation from one period of the
oscillation does not overlap the radiation from the next
period unless

η <

∼ 1.

(38)

Hence, there is no constructive interference and conse-
quent sharpening of the frequency spectrum unless con-
dition (38) is satisﬁed.

For η > 1, the radiation is essentially the sum of syn-
chrotron radiation from N0 separate magnets each λ0
long, and this case is called wiggler radiation.

The laboratory frequency of the radiation is now

ωC ≈ 2γ 2ω0,

(39)

rather than (24). However, in the regime of undulator
radiation, (38), there is little diﬀerence between the two
expressions.

D. η < 1: Weak Undulators

The estimate (29) for the power of undulator radiation
holds only if essentially the whole virtual photon cloud
around the electron is shaken oﬀ. This can be expected to
happen only if the amplitude of the electron’s transverse
motion exceeds the minimum impact parameter bmin ≈
γλC introduced in eq. (4). From eqs. (25) and (33), we
see that the transverse amplitude obeys

5

angle θC where cos θC = c/nv = 1/nβ. For large θC , the
formation length L0 = vt0 is the distance over which the
electron pulls one wavelength ahead of the projection of
the wave motion onto the electron’s direction:

λ = vt0 −

c
n

t0 cos θC = L0 sin2 θC .

(44)

Then L0 = λ/ sin2 θC, and the photon spectrum per unit
path length from (2) is

dω
ω

≈

(45)

as is well-known.

If the medium extends only to a transverse radius b
from the particle’s trajectory, a critical wavelength is de-
ﬁned by eq. (4) as λC ≈ b/γ. For wavelengths longer
than this, the full virtual photon cloud is not be shaken
oﬀ, and the ˇCerenkov radiation is weaker than eq. (45).
Of course, ˇCerenkov radiation is limited to wavelengths

for which n(λ) > c/v.

Abstract

In this paper we study the possibility of utilizing a loaded wire medium as an artiﬁcial material
for beam shaping element in base station antenna applications. The wires in the lattice are
loaded with a proper capacitive impedance to come up with a structure eﬀectively operating as
a dielectric lens at the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) frequency range.
It is proven with full-wave simulations that the interpretation of a ﬁnite size wire lattice as a
dielectric lens is physically sound even with a moderate number of lattice periods. A prototype
having a mechanically reconﬁgurable beam width is constructed and measured.
It is shown
that very promising performance can be achieved with a rather simple structure and a cheap
manufacturing process.

1 Introduction

It is expected that the enormous growth of the traﬃc load in the wireless networks will continue
in the near future. The transition era from the 3rd generation systems to 4G networks leads to
applications that will require huge data rates and therefore extremely eﬃcient network plan-
ning [1, 2]. Undoubtedly, novel implementation techniques are needed to lighten the pressure
concerning the improvement of base station antennas. Ultimately, the antenna must be robust
and cheap for mass production implying that the structure should be small and simple. How-
ever, sectorized cells and the natural evolutional stages of the network often set the demand for
the antenna to operate in diﬀerent modes with diﬀerent service areas. Therefore, the antenna
should oﬀer a possibility for a tunable beam width or a switchable beam direction. Incorpo-
rating intelligence in a miniaturized and simple antenna structure while still maintaining the
eﬃciency high, is not an easy task.

The operational principle of a medium consisting of periodically arranged wires has been known
for a long time [3, 4]. This kind of wire medium (also called rodded medium) is known to
operate as an artiﬁcial dielectric with negative eﬀective permittivity at low frequencies. Due to
the periodic nature of the wire medium, the medium can be considered as an electromagnetic
band-gap (EBG) structure introducing frequency bands in which electromagnetic waves cannot
propagate [5]. A detailed analysis of the electromagnetic band structures of the wire medium
in [6, 7]. The transmission and absorption properties of a two-dimensional
can be found e.g.
(2D) lattice of conducting cylinders have been presented [8], and the eﬀective electronic response
of a system of metallic cylinders has been introduced [9].

The nature of wave propagation inside the wire medium and its dispersion properties have also
been subjects of comprehensive studies. In [10] the wave propagation inside the wire medium
was studied in detail. Comprehensive analytical study of the dispersion and reﬂection properties
in [11, 12, 13]. Authors of [12] considered also a wire
of the wire medium can be found e.g.
medium periodically loaded with bulk reactances and presented the dispersion relation for this
kind of loaded wire medium. A quasi-static model for the loaded wire medium can be found in
[14].

Recently, extensive research has been devoted to the utilization of the wire medium in mi-
crowave applications. The transmission properties of loaded and unloaded wire medium have
been theoretically and experimentally analyzed in [15]. In [16] the authors presented an EBG
structure consisting of cut metal strips mounted with pin-diodes. Depending on the diode bi-
asing the structure was shown to prohibit the propagation of the electromagnetic waves or to
create a very directed beam for a planar antenna. Discussion about the performance of antennas
inside wire lattices has been presented in [17], and authors of [18] presented an experimental
demonstration for the radiation characteristics of a conventional dipole inside the wire medium.
The utilization of dipole arrays (somewhat resembling the case of cut wires with the introduced
cap width extending towards inﬁnity) as a beam shaping lens was introduced in the beginning
of 80’s by Milne [19]. A mathematical design procedure for a non-homogenous wire medium
lens antenna can be found in [20]. Analytical and numerical results for the radiation properties
of a simple radiator in the vicinity of the loaded wire medium were presented in [21], and an
experimental demonstration of the feasibility to use the loaded wire medium with compact and

directive antenna applications can be found in [22].

In the present paper we utilize the properties of the loaded wire medium [12, 21] to design
a compact dual-mode base station antenna having a mechanically reconﬁgurable beam width.
After capacitive loading the plasmon-like band-gap inherent to the conventional wire medium
disappears and the structure becomes transparent for radiation [12, 15]. Moreover, the proper
loading allows us to reduce dramatically the size of the radiator without a loss of the radiation
eﬃciency [21].
It is shown below that the interpretation of the loaded wire medium as an
artiﬁcial dielectric lens is possible even with a moderate number of lattice periods. Around the
frequency range of interest the wire lattice operates as a ﬁnite size block of artiﬁcial dielectric
as schematically depicted in Fig. 1. The key beneﬁts of the proposed antenna structure are
low cost, cheap manufacturing process, and extremely light weight. An antenna prototype is
manufactured and measured. It is shown that the theory of an aperture radiator is applicable
in the designing process of the wire medium lens antenna.

2 Loaded wire medium: Revision of the dispersion prop-

erties

A schematic illustration of the loaded wire medium is shown in Fig. 2. It is known that the
conventional wire medium (solid wires) exhibits a plasmon-like band-gap starting from zero
frequency [7, 12, 15]. This means that at low frequencies electromagnetic waves cannot propa-
gate through the wire medium (except to the direction along the wires). This further implies
that if a radiator is brought inside conventional wire medium, a channel must be conﬁgured in
the structure to permit the emission of electromagnetic waves (see e.g.
[18] for experimental
demonstration). In addition to this, the transversal size of such a structure is necessarily rather
large due to destructive interaction between the source current and the currents ﬂowing in the
closely located solid wires. When the wires are loaded with bulk capacitances the low frequency
band-gap disappears [12, 15]. Moreover, it was analytically shown in [21], and experimentally
proven in [22] that the problem of ﬁeld cancelation can also be overcome with the use of bulk

Let us consider the loaded wire medium periodically loaded with bulk capacitances as shown in
Fig. 2 (Z =
). In [12] the dispersion equation for such a medium was formulated in terms
of Floquet harmonics, scattered by the set of parallel wire grids periodically located along the
x
axis (with period a, see Fig. 2). Authors of [12] presented also a simpliﬁed expression for
the full dispersion equation applicable for dense wire lattices (the lattice periods a and b are
much smaller than the wavelength in the matrix material). Moreover, special attention was
devoted to waves traveling orthogonally to the wire axis (the z-component of the propagation
factor is zero, qz = 0). This special case was considered at low frequencies compared to the ﬁrst
lattice resonance of the loaded wire medium. At these frequencies the magnetic properties of the
medium are negligible and the eﬀective medium model becomes valid. With the aforementioned
assumptions, the simpliﬁed dispersion equation for dense wire lattices was reformulated using
the resonant eﬀective permittivity

where ǫ and µ are the material parameters of the matrix material, and k is the wave number in
the matrix material. For a capacitively loaded wire medium the resonant eﬀective permittivity
takes the form [12]

where C is the load capacitance C0 multiplied by the period of insertions l, and s is a geometrical
parameter deﬁned below. The resonant frequency can be expressed as [12]

The real part of the eﬀective permittivity of a wire medium eﬀectively loaded with a certain
capacitance per unit length is shown in Fig. 3. We can see from Fig. 3 that the permittivity
obeys the Lorenzian type dispersion rule. Before the ﬁrst stop band (F < 9.85 GHz) the
refractive index is a monotonically growing function and the loaded wire medium operates as a
F < 13.7 GHz the medium can be considered
usual artiﬁcial dielectric. At frequencies 9.85

Relatively far away from the structure resonance the eﬀective permittivity has nearly a constant
value. For reference, around 2 GHz the real part of the eﬀective permittivity equals approxi-
mately 2.0. Rather low and frequency-independent value for the permittivity of the lens can
be considered as an advantage for the lens design. The aforementioned supports the idea of
utilizing the loaded wire medium as a light-weight artiﬁcial dielectric lens, as schematically
depicted in Fig. 1.

Note that this principle of utilization is fundamentally diﬀerent from the angular ﬁltering
techniques [23] introduced in the literature for diﬀerent types of EBG structures [15, 16, 24, 25].
The known beam shaping methods utilize defects in the EBG structure to create a transmission
peak inside the original stopband. It is known [23] that a slight local change in the crystal period
leads to localized resonant modes, and can be used for the realization of devices radiating energy
in a very narrow angular range. At frequencies lying inside the original band-gap of the crystal,
discontinuous wires [16] or dielectric rods [24, 25] located in front of a low gain radiator can also
be used as simple angular ﬁlters. One of the biggest disadvantages of this utilization technique
is a very narrow operational bandwidth. We, on the contrary, propose the utilization of the

5

EBG structure far below the ﬁrst stopband and regard the loaded wire medium as a piece of a
usual homogenous dielectric.

It is also worth noticing that due to very high signal power levels used in base stations (e.g.
Kathrein [26] reports the maximum power per input to be 300 W for most of the products),
active components cannot be used in the lens due to unavoidable intermodulation products
leading to distorted frequency spectrum. Therefore we seek for a solution where the bulk
capacitances are implemented without using active components.

3 Designing the novel antenna structure

3.1 Desired characteristics

The goal of the following antenna design procedure is to come up with a compact base station
antenna structure having two modes corresponding to two beam widths in the H-plane (the
plane orthogonal to the wires). The carrying idea is to design as simple and robust antenna
as possible. The beam width is to be reconﬁgured mechanically to maintain the simplicity of
the design, and to avoid problems caused by active components when using high signal power
levels. The targeted radiation characteristics are presented below:

1. Frequency range 1920 – 2170 MHz (UMTS FDD range)

2. Maximum transversal size < 15 cm1

3. Backward radiation as small as possible

4. Half-power beam width in H-plane 65◦ / 85◦

Other important features for a design close to an end product are the E-plane beamwidth,
E-plane side lobe level, the gain, and the longitudinal size of the structure. The main practical
importance of the present work is the demonstration of the beam switching with the help of
the artiﬁcial wire medium lens. However, to be assure for the feasibility of the structure in base
station antenna applications, we will also introduce the radiation pattern in E-plane, and the
simulated gain values. The optimization of the antenna matching, and the details in the actual
mechanical switching procedure are not discussed in the present work.

The main parameters characterizing the feasibility of the antenna structure are the deviation
in the input impedance, front-to-back ratio (FBR), robustness and the H-plane beamwidth.
Ideally, the only changing parameter between the modes should be the H-plane beamwidth.
The robustness refers to the fact that the radiation characteristics of the antenna should not
change dramatically when the parameters of the structure (e.g. the lattice parameters a, b, the
value of the load capacitance C0) are changed slightly. This is very important in the view of
the manufacturing process. To maintain the design as simple as possible, we seek for a solution
where the structure consists of two parts. Namely, the antenna has a ﬁxed part and a removable

part. The ﬁxed part consists of the radiator accompanied with a possible reﬂector, whereas
the removable part is formed by the wires located in front of the radiator. Fixing the radiator
and the reﬂector sets an additional demand for the removable part. In addition to producing
diﬀerent beam widths, the removable part should not change strongly the input impedance
seen at the antenna terminals. This ensures a reasonable matching level with both modes.

3.2 Numerical design

Suitable geometry for the prototype leading to the desired performance was found with numer-
ical simulations conducted with a commercial method of moments (MoM) simulator FEKO [27].
It was suggested in [21] and experimentally proven in [22] that to achieve a zenithal radiation
pattern in the H-plane, the optimal number of loaded wires with a half-wavelength dipole is
approximately 20–30 and the shape of the lattice is close to a triangular one. This estimation
laid the basis for the optimization process.

Fig. 4 shows the ﬁnal outcome of the designing process. As we can see there is a considerable
diﬀerence between the topology of the wide and the narrow lens. This is, however, well pre-
dictable according to the theory of an aperture radiator [28]: As the far ﬁeld radiation pattern
of an aperture radiator (e.g. a lens illuminated with a low gain radiator) is the Fourier trans-
form of the illuminating ﬁeld distribution, the wider is the aperture, the narrower is the beam.
To suppress the backward radiation a metal reﬂector is used. The reﬂector can also be made

In the present design the beam switching (reconﬁguration) function is implemented by manually
changing the removable part in front of the radiator. Other possibilities (not studied in the
present paper) could include ﬁxing the lens topology and modifying the impedance loading by
mechanically or electronically tuning the load capacitances. This, however, adds complexity to
the design, and might require the use of active components in the lens.

Fig. 5 introduces the simulated far ﬁeld patterns in the H- and E-planes. The main simulated
parameters are gathered in Table 1. Presented simulations have been conducted at the UMTS
FDD uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) center frequencies, namely at FUL = 1.95 GHz and FDL =
2.14 GHz. As can be seen, the beam widths in the H-plane are very close to the goal values 65◦
and 85◦ with the wide and narrow lens respectively. The beam width in the E-plane is typical
when using only one dipole as a source. The simulated gain values (at the center frequency
Fc= 2.045 GHz) with the wide and narrow lens are 10.9 and 9.6 dBi, respectively. A design
closer to an end product could have e.g. a collinear array of crossed dipoles and a total height
close to one meter. This would signiﬁcantly narrow the E-plane beam width and increase the
gain of the structure.

3.3 Selected observations on the antenna behavior

In this section we have gathered some typical (qualitative) tendencies in the antenna behavior
noticed during the the simulation process. One of the most important observations with the

8

simulated structures (having a ﬁnite size reﬂector or no reﬂector at all) is the fact that a
good FBR level contradicts rather heavily with a narrow beam width in H-plane.
In other
words, with nearly all the simulated lens topologies and reﬂector shapes, narrowing the H-
plane beam width deteriorates the FBR (this can not readily be seen in the results presented
for the prototype with two modes, since the whole lens topology is changed to manipulate the
H-plane beam width). With a ﬁxed topology of the lens (e.g. the wide lens topology in the
prototype), the most eﬀective way to narrow the H-plane beam width is to increase the value
of the lattice parameter b, see Fig. 4 for deﬁnition. This, however, has also a strong negative
eﬀect on the FBR level. If a rather moderate H-plane beam width is desired, the rows of wires
can be brought in a close vicinity of each other still maintaining the FBR at a very good level
[22]. If a considerably narrow H-plane beam width is to be achieved, the wave has to travel a
longer distance in the lens (phase shifts of the currents induced to the wires far away from the
radiator have to change rapidly enough). This means increasing the depth of the lens.

A general tendency with the simulated structures is that a good FBR level corresponds to a
small value of the radiation resistance and vice versa. One of the biggest drawbacks of the
studied structures is the strong deviation of the input impedance (radiation resistance) over
the desired frequency range. Typically the change in the radiation resistance over the UMTS
band is close to 50 percent, the minimum resistance occurring at lower frequencies. This
naturally implies diﬃculties in maintaining the matching at a reasonable level over the whole
frequency range, but also causes deviation in the beam width and FBR. With most of the
10◦ wider at the UL range than at the
studied structures the beam width is approximately 5
DL range (the aperture is narrower in terms of wavelength) and the deviation in the FBR is
approximately 5 dB.

−

The value of the loading capacitance naturally depends on the insertion period of the loads.
However, a suitable capacitance range producing reasonable performance can be found and the
following observations can be made for this range (a ﬁxed lens topology close to a triangular
one assumed): Increasing the capacitance narrows the beam width but also deteriorates the
FBR. This is due to the fact that with increasing capacitance the radiation resistance grows (up

to a certain limit). When increasing the capacitance too much the radiation pattern changes
very dramatically leading to a pattern with a very strong backward lobe and the main beam of
a shape of a trefoil. On the other hand, a too low value for the capacitance leads to a structure
that practically does not radiate (due to the destructive interaction between the source and the
passive wires).

4 FDTD model for the dispersive dielectric lens

In this section we consider a ﬁnite size lattice of loaded wires as a block of dispersive dielectric
material, as schematically depicted in Fig. 1. The dispersive behavior of the capacitively loaded
wire medium has been shown to follow the expression (2) [12] (when the operational frequency
is far below the ﬁrst stop band and the array is dense).
In this section we use an in-house
ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) code and study the equivalence of the wire lattice to a
dielectric lens in the case of a moderate number of lattice periods.

We choose to analyze the wide lens (for the transversal geometry see Fig. 4(a)). It was experi-
mentally shown in [22] that the height of the structure (the dimension in the z-direction) has
only a very weak eﬀect on the radiation pattern in the H-plane at low frequencies. Therefore
to reduce the computational burden we consider without a signiﬁcant loss of accuracy a two
dimensional case in FDTD. The exact simulated structures are depicted in Fig. 6(a).

The dispersive behavior for the eﬀective permittivity has been implemented in the code us-
ing the auxiliary diﬀerential equation (ADE) method [29]. The ADE method is applied for a
medium having Lorentzian type dispersive permittivity with one pair of poles in its suscep-

with ω0 (in the eﬀective medium model (2) δ0 = 0). Utilizing (5) and (6) we construct a
three step fully explicit procedure for updating the ﬁeld components and the components of
the polarization current.
Fig. 6(b) shows the normalized far ﬁeld patterns for the electric ﬁeld simulated with FEKO and
FDTD. This ﬁgure demonstrates the equivalence of the wire lattice to a ﬁnite size dielectric
block. The agreement between the shape of the main lobe is good at both frequencies. The
overall agreement of the two patterns is good at the DL frequency. When thinking of dielectric
lenses implemented with substrates, the wire medium lens behaves in a similar manner, however,
it is cheaper and, more importantly, lighter.

5 Prototype antenna

To manufacture the prototype we use a standard printed circuit board technique where the
loaded wires are split strips on dielectric plates. The eﬀects of the dielectric sheets have been
taken into account by slightly modifying the prototype design, see Table 2. The modiﬁcations
were enough to suppress the FBR with the cost of increased reﬂector size. Note, however, that
the use of a larger size reﬂector is well justiﬁed since when mounting the antenna structure into
a base station mast the mast itself operates as a large reﬂector.

A photo showing the implemented prototype (with the wide lens connected) is presented in
Fig. 7(a). FR-4 is used as the dielectric substrate material in the prototype antenna (the
substrate thickness equals 1.0 mm with the wide lens and 0.8 mm with the narrow lens, ǫr
4.5).
The strip width is equal to tw = 2.25 mm with the wide lens and tn = 2.50 mm with the narrow

where the empirically found multiplication factor m is approximately 0.7. One half-wavelength

balun symmetrizing the feeding.

The measurements validating the main practical importance of the present work, the feasibility
of the wire medium lens as a beam shaping element, are the measurement of the S11-parameter
and the measurement of the 2D radiation pattern in the H-plane. These measurements conﬁrm
that the antenna matching does not change signiﬁcantly when switching from one beam width
to another, and that the beam width can be controlled by manipulating the lattice topology.

5.1 Matching level

Fig. 7(b) shows the measured S11-parameter. The matching of the antenna has not been
optimized (the best matching occurs a bit below the center frequency 2.045 GHz). A matching
network (implemented e.g. using coaxial stubs) would improve the matching level at the center
frequency and oﬀer a possibility to tune the location of the S11-minimum. However, when
thinking of a real end product, special attention should be devoted to the design of a wideband
matching network.

12

With the introduced prototype the matching level remains almost the same for both wide and
narrow lens. However, from the presented measurement we can not readily draw a general
conclusion that the matching hardly depends on the removable part of the dielectric lens. This
is due to the fact that the prototype antenna is only satisfactorily matched, with a well matched
antenna the eﬀect seen on the matching level can be larger.

5.2

2D radiation pattern

Fig. 8 introduces the measured H-plane radiation patterns for both wide and narrow lenses.
The FEKO simulations for the implemented prototype are plotted for reference. The measured
half-power beam widths and FBRs are gathered in Table 3. The measured gain values (at
the center frequency Fc= 2.045 GHz) with the wide and narrow lens are 9.8 and 8.0 dBi,
respectively.

The measured results agree rather well with the simulated ones. The main lobe beam width and
the FBR are in good agreement. The deviation is visible only in the side lobe directions. This
deviation and the slight asymmetry of the pattern are, probably, caused by the feed network and
the currents induced to the edges of the reﬂector plate. The reﬂectivity level of the measurement
chamber was estimated to be
25 dB at 2 GHz (implying that the side and back lobe levels
are in fact unreliable). The manufacturing process is fast, robust and inexpensive. However, a
10 percents in the load capacitance was measured over
random discrepancy of approximately
the slots with a high precision LC

±
meter.

6 Conclusion

In the present paper we have studied the applicability of the loaded wire medium as a beam
shaping lens. The dispersion properties of the loaded wire medium introduced in the literature
have been brieﬂy revised. Contrary to the known EBG beam shaping techniques, we have chosen
to utilize the frequency range far below the ﬁrst stop band of the structure. In this region the
loaded wire medium can be interpreted as a continuous artiﬁcial dielectric. A concept for a
compact dual-mode base station antenna operating in the UMTS frequency range has been
presented. We have conﬁrmed that the theory of an aperture radiator is applicable when
designing the wire medium lens antenna. A FDTD model for the dispersive dielectric lens
having the wire lattice geometry has been constructed. The full wave simulations reveal that
the loaded wire lattice operates as a dielectric block even with a rather small number of lattice
periods. A promising performance of the prototype is shown to be achieved with a rather simple
structure and cheap manufacturing process.

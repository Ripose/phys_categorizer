Abstract

We comment on some recent attempts to model nonconservative systems
with fractional derivatives. It is proven that it is impossible to derive a sin-
gle, retarded equation of motion using a variational principle under certain
reasonable assumptions.

1 Introduction

In 1932 Bauer proved the following corollary [2]: ‘The equations of motion of a
dissipative linear dynamical system with constant coefﬁcients are not given by a
variational principle’. There are a few methods that may allow us to get around
Bauer’s corollary. For example, we could allow additional equations of motion to
result. Bateman used this technique in [1]. If we use the Lagrangian

L = m ˙x ˙y +

(x ˙y − ˙xy) − mω2xy

,where C is a constant, we would have that following equations of motion

m¨x + C ˙x + mω2x = 0
m¨y − C ˙y + mω2y = 0 .

Bateman’s method uses the loophole that Bauer’s proof assumed that no additional
equations arise.

Riewe pointed out that Bauer’s proof also implicitly assumes that all of the
derivatives are integer ordered [5]. This has led to attempts to use fractional
derivatives in the actions to model nonconservative systems [3, 4, 5]. Here we will
close this second loophole by extending Bauer’s corollary to include fractional
derivatives.

Our paper is organized as follows.

In section 2 we review the background
material needed for our result. The extension of Bauer’s corollary is proved in
section 3. A brief discussion follows in section 4

2 Background material

Here we develop the relevant mathematics for our proof. A fuller discussion of
this material can be found in [3]. Fractional derivatives can be deﬁned using the
theory of distributions. Deﬁne the generalized functions

where Γ(α) is the gamma function. The left fractional derivatives (LFD) of a
function q(t) is given by

where we set q(t) ≡ 0 for t < a. When α = n, n an integer, (6) becomes

where D is the generalized derivative. Right fractional derivatives (RFDs) are
deﬁned similarly

In [3] the actions were treated as Volterra series. The Volterra series are a
generalization to functionals of the power series of a function. For a functional
V[q], deﬁned the symmetric kernels

K (s)

n (τ1, . . . , τn)

:=

δnV[q]
δq(τ1) · · · δq(τn)

.

Now introduce the notation

Then V[q] can be written as

K (s)

n ⋆ qn

:=

· · ·

Zτ1

Zτn

K (s)

n (τ1, . . . , τn)q(τn) · · · q(τ1)dτn · · · dτ1 .

where we set K (s)

0 ≡ 0.

The Φ±

α (t) are now treated as kernels in a Volterra series. We can then take the
functional derivative of the series to derive our equations of motion. An example
should make this clearer. We will restrict our attention to the action

V[q] =

where K2(t, τ ) in (13) is an arbitrary kernel, i.e., not necessarily symmetric as in
(10). (Equation (13) would be sufﬁciently general to handle the nonconservative
harmonic oscillator.) Now let K2(t, τ ) be given by

K2(t, τ )

:= mΦ+

−2(t − τ ) + mCΦ+

−γ(t − τ ) + mω2Φ+

0 (t − τ )

(14)

where 0 < γ < 2 and C is a constant. So (13) becomes

3 The result

In section 2 we reviewed the procedure Dreisigmeyer and Young proposed in [3]
for deriving a system’s equations of motion. From (ref18) and (ref19) we see that
two equations are actually derived: an advanced one and a retarded one. So this
is, effectively, a generalization of Bateman’s method (see (1) – (3)). That is, extra
equations of motion are allowed to result from the action’s variation.

We desire to have a single, retarded equation of motion to result from a
variational principle. From (ref15) we see that the derivative operators are always

contained in the K2(t, τ ) kernel. Perhaps it is possible to use some other kernel
other than the Φ±
α (t − τ ) to have a fractional derivative arise from an action’s
variation? The following theorem shows that this is not possible.

Theorem 3.1 There does not exist a K(t, τ ), t, τ ∈ R, such that the variation of
the quantity

V[q] =

K(t, τ )q(t)q(τ )dtdτ

(19)

will result in a
PROOF. The variation of V[q] is given by

t [q] for α 6= 2n, n an integer.

δV[q]
δq(ρ)

= [K(ρ, t) + K(t, ρ)] ⋆ q(t)

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

We will assume that

[K(ρ, t) + K(t, ρ)] ⋆ q(t) = Φ+

−α(ρ − t) ⋆ q(t)

and arrive at a contradiction. We require that (21) holds for every q(t). Then we
must have

Interchanging ρ and t in (22) gives us

[K(ρ, t) + K(t, ρ)] = Φ+

−α(ρ − t)

[K(ρ, t) + K(t, ρ)] = Φ−

−α(ρ − t)

Hence, unless Φ±
−α(ρ − t) is symmetric in ρ and t, (22) and (23) cannot both hold.
That is, unless α = 2n, n an integer, there does not exist a K(t, τ ), t, τ ∈ R, such
that (21) holds.(cid:4)

The above theorem effectively closes the possibility of using fractional deriva-
tives to bypass Bauer’s corollary. Thus, the fractional mechanics formalisms
presented in [3, 4, 5] cannot derive a single, retarded equation of motion. In or-
der to overcome this difﬁculty, Riewe suggested approximating RFDs with LFDs
[4, 5]. Dreisigmeyer and Young showed in [3] that this is not a sound idea and,
instead, allowed for an extra, advanced equation of motion. This latter technique
is not, itself, entirely satisfactory.

4 Discussion

Theorem 3.1 shows that some revision of our concept of an action may be in
order if we desire a variational principle to work for nonconservative systems.
How could we derive a single, retarded equation of motion for systems? Our
result holds even if K2(t, τ ) is allowed to be complex. We would also require
that q(t) = q(τ ) for t = τ in (19). That is, we do not want to employ Bateman’s
method, as was done in [3]. Currently there is no known procedure that satisﬁes
the above criteria. However, the treatment of actions as Volterra series can guide
our future research. The next obvious choice wold be to allow the time variables
t and τ in (19) to be complex. Whether this would work is still an open question.

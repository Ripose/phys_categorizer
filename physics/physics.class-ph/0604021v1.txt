Abstract

This paper aims to show that making use of Newton’s view on equations of motion of a
physical system and of the Maxwell stress tensor we come to a natural nonlinearization of
Maxwell equations in vacuum making use only of nonrelativistic terms. The new equations
include all Maxwell solutions plus new ones, among which one may ﬁnd time-stable and
spatially ﬁnite ones with photon-like properties and behavior.

Introduction

As it is well known the vacuum Maxwell equations do not admit spatially ﬁnite time-stable
solutions of photon-like type. This is due to the fact that every component U (x, y, z, t) of the
electric E and magnetic B ﬁelds necessarily satisﬁes the D’Alembert wave equation (cid:3)U = 0,
and according to the Poisson’s theorem for this equation, every spatially ﬁnite initial condition
U (x, y, z, 0) = ϕ(x, y, z); ∂U
∂t (x, y, z, 0) = ψ(x, y, z), where ϕ and ψ are ﬁnite functions, blows up
radially and goes to inﬁnity with the speed of light [1,2,3]. So, through every spatial point outside
the initial condition pass fore-front and back-front, and after this the corresponding point forgets
about what has happened. This rigorous mathematical result does not allow to describe ﬁnite
electromagnetic pulses propagating uniformly in vacuum as a whole along some spatial direction
without dispersion. Moreover, no expectations for description of photon-like objects having also
rotational component of propagation would seem to be reasonable and well-grounded.

On the other hand the Poynting energy-momentum balance equation

∂
∂t

E2 + B2

= −c div(E × B),

where c is the velocity of light in vacuum, admits time-stable spatially ﬁnite solutions with the
desired 3-dimensional soliton-like behavior, for example

E = [u(x, y, ct + εz), p (x, y, ct + εz), 0], B = [εp (x, y, ct + εz), −εu(x, y, ct + εz), 0], ε = ±1 ,

where u and p are arbitrary functions, so they can be chosen ﬁnite. This observation suggests
to look deeper and more carefully into the structures and assumptions used for mathematical
interpretation of the experimental electric-magnetic discoveries made in the 19th century. In
other words, which relations and on what grounds should be deﬁned as basic, so that the further
deduced equations to give reasonable and physically acceptable solutions. Finding the right

way to choosing adequate mathematical objects and corresponding equations seems specially
important when we try to describe the intrinsic dynamical properties of the very ﬁeld. Therefore,
it seems very important to have the right notion for concepts like physical object, intrinsic
property, dynamical property, identifying characteristics, admissible changes, ﬁeld equations,
etc. Some preliminary considerations in this direction might be the following ones.

From a deﬁnite point of view every physical system is characterized by two kinds of prop-
erties. The ﬁrst kind of properties we call identifying, they identify the system throughout its
existence in time, so, the corresponding physical quantities/relations must show deﬁnite conser-
vation/constancy properties (with respect to the identiﬁcation procedure assumed). Without
such experimentally established properties we could not talk about physical objects/systems
at all. The second kind of properties characterize the time-evolution of the system, the cor-
responding quantities are time-dependent, and the corresponding evolution is consistent with
the conservative/constant character of the identifying properties/quantities. So, the equations
of motion of a physical system determine the admissible time-changes of these quantities. For
example, the mass m of a classical particle is an identifying quantity, while the velocity v is a
kinematical one. This view implies, of course, that the external world acts on the system under
consideration also in an admissible way, i.e. the system survives, the interaction with the outside
world does not lead to its destruction.

In theoretical physics we usually make use of quantities which are functions of the identifying
and of the kinematical characteristics of the system and call them dynamical quantities. A
well known example is the momentum p of a particle: p = mv. Of crucial importance for the
description of admissible changes are the conservative dynamical quantities, i.e. those which may
pass from one physical system to another with NO LOSS. For example energy and momentum
are such quantities, moreover, they are universal in the sense that every physical object carries
non-zero energy-momentum. So, if a deﬁnite quantity of energy-momentum passes from one
object to another, this same quantity of energy-momentum can be expressed in terms of the
characteristics of the two objects, and the two expressions to be equalized. In this way we obtain
equations of motion, and this is the way used by Newton to write down his famous equations
˙p = F, where F carries information about where the momentum change of the particle has gone,
or has come from. This also clariﬁes the physical sense of the concept of force as a change of
momentum. Paying due respect to Newton we shall call some equations of motion of Newton
type if on the two sides of ” = ” stay physical quantities of energy-momentum change, or energy-
momentum density change in the case of continuous systems.

If there is no energy-momentum (or energy-momentum density) change, then putting the
corresponding expression equal to zero, we obtain the ”free particle” or ”free ﬁeld” equations.
In such a case we just declare that only those changes are admissible which are consistent with
the (local and integral) energy-momentum conservation.

We note that an initial extent of knowledge about the system we are going to describe
mathematically is presupposed to be available, so that the assumptions made to be, more or
less, well grounded. This knowledge is the base that generates corresponding insight and directs
our attention to the appropriate mathematical structures. This is exclusively important when
we deal with continuous, or ﬁeld, physical objects/systems.

In view of the above considerations, roughly speaking, in the ”free ﬁeld” case the steps to
follow are: ﬁrst we specify and consider the mathematical model-object Φ which is chosen
to represent the integrity of the physical system considered, second, deﬁne the change-object
D(Φ), third, ”project” D(Φ) on Φ by means of some (in most cases bilinear) map P, fourth,
the projection P(D(Φ), Φ) obtained we interpret physically as energy-momentum change and,
ﬁnally, we put this projection equal to zero. The zero value of the projection is interpreted in

2

the sense that the identifying characteristics of Φ have not been disturbed, or, the change D(Φ)
is qualiﬁed as admissible, or, not essential. This consideration shows the importance of knowing
how much energy-momentum a given physical system is potentially able to lose, or gain (locally
or globally), without losing its identity.

It is always very important to take care of the physical sense of the quantities that we put
on the two sides of the relation A = B. Mathematically, from set theory point of view, A and
B denote the same element, which element may be expressed in diﬀerent terms, e.g. the real
number 2 can be expressed as 3 − 1 = 6/3 = 2(sin2x + cos2x) = d
dx (2x + const) and also in
many other ways. From physical point of view, however, we must be sure that A and B denote
the same thing qualitatively and quantitatively, i.e. the same physical quantity. This is specially
important when the equation we want to write down constitutes some basic relation. And the
point is not the physical dimension of the two sides to be the same: any two quantities by means
of an appropriate constant can be made of the same physical dimension, but this is a formal
step. The point is that the physical nature of the quantity on the two sides must be the same.
For example, it is quite clear that on the two sides of the Newton’s law ˙p = F stays the same
physical quantity, namely, the quantity ”change of momentum”. For a counterexample, which
physical quantity stays on the two sides of the Poisson equation ∆U = kρ? On one hand, such
a quantity is expressed through ∆U and appears as a characteristic of the ﬁeld U , and, on the
other hand, it is expressed through kρ and appears as a characteristic of the mass particles, so,
do we know such a quantity? The same question can be raised for one of the Maxwell equations:
rot B − 1
c

˙E = 4π

In the case of classical particles momentum is always represented as the product mv. In
the continuous ﬁeld case, especially when we do NOT have any knowledge about the ”building
material” of the object/system considered, there is no universal way in general to ﬁnd out the
corresponding expressions for the energy-momentum densities and their changes along spatial
and time directions. It was a remarkable achievement of Maxwell to determine the right ex-
pressions for the energy density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld through the concept of stress [4],
already used in the description of other continuous physical systems with known ”building ma-
terial”, namely, mass particles. His electromagnetic stress tensor M ij still plays an essential
role in modern electromagnetic theory. However, by some reasons, he did not make use of the
computed by him divergence ∇iM ij of the stress tensor for writing down Newton type equations
of motion for a free electromagnetic ﬁeld through equalizing diﬀerent expressions for the same
momentum change. Probably, he had missed the vector E × B (introduced by Poynting 5 years
after Maxwell’s death) as a momentum density quantity (or energy density ﬂow) in the pure
ﬁeld case.

c j.

In this paper we consider one possible approach to come to natural free ﬁeld equations of
motion of Newton type that could be deduced making use of formally introduced vacuum analog
of the Maxwell stress tensor and of the Poynting vector in the frame of non-relativistic notions
and concepts. As a ﬁrst step we are going to show that an analog of Maxwell’s stress tensor
participates in a mathematical identity having nothing to do with any physics.

2 A non-physical view on Maxwell stress tensor

The mathematical identities have always attracted the attention of theorists, in particular,
those identities which involve the derivatives of the objects of interest (diﬀerential identities).
A well known such example is the Bianchi identity satisﬁed by any connection components:
this identity is a second order system of (in general, nonlinear) partial diﬀerential equations.
The gauge interpretation of classical Maxwell electrodynamics, as well as the Yang-Mills theory,

3

substantially make use of this identity. Such identities are of particular importance when on the
two sides of ”=” stay correctly (i.e. in a coordinate free way) deﬁned expressions.

We show now that in the frame of classical vector analysis any two vector ﬁelds (V, W ) and
the corresponding mathematical analog of the Maxwell stress tensor M ij(V, W ) are involved in
a diﬀerential identity. Introducing the Maxwell stress tensor in such a formal way in the vacuum
case will help us avoid all questions concerning the structure and properties of aether.

We begin with the well known diﬀerential relation satisﬁed by every vector ﬁeld V on the
euclidean space R3 related to the standard coordinates (xi = x, y, z), i = 1, 2, 3, denoting by V 2
the euclidean square of V , by ” × ” - the vector product, and using the ∇-operator:

1
2

∇(V 2) = V × rot V + (V.∇)V = V × rot V + ∇V V.

Clearly, the ﬁrst term on the right hand side of this identity accounts for the rotational compo-
nent of the change of V , and the second term accounts for the translational component of the
change of V . Making use of component notation we write down the last term on the right side
as follows (summation over the repeated indices):

(∇V V )j = V i∇iV j = ∇i(V iV j) − V j∇iV i = ∇i(V iV j) − V jdiv V

Substituting into the ﬁrst identity, and making some elementary transformations we obtain

V iV j −

δij V 2

∇i

(rot V ) × V + V div V
(cid:2)
where δij = 1 for i = j, and δij = 0 for i 6= j. If now W is another vector ﬁeld it must satisfy
the same above identity:

δij W 2

(rot W ) × W + W div W

(cid:3)

Summing up these two identities we obtain the new identity

(cid:3)

=

(rot V ) × V + V div V + (rot W ) × W + W div W

(1)

(cid:2)

We emphasize once again the two moments: ﬁrst, this identity (1) has nothing to do with any
physics; second, on the two sides of (1) stay well deﬁned coordinate free quantities.

The expression inside the round brackets on the left of (1), denoted by M ij, looks formally
the same as the introduced by Maxwell tensor from physical considerations concerned with the
electromagnetic stress energy properties of continuous media in presence of external electromag-
netic ﬁeld. This allows to call formally any such tensor Maxwell stress tensor generated by
the two vector ﬁelds (V, W ) . The term ”stress” in this general mathematical setting could be
interpreted (or, justiﬁed) in the following way. Every vector ﬁeld on R3 generates corresponding
ﬂow by means of the trajectories started from some domain Uo ⊂ R3: at the moment t > 0
the domain Uo is diﬀeomorphically transformed to a new domain Ut ⊂ R3. Having two vector
ﬁelds on R3 we obtain two consistent ﬂows, so, the points of any domain Uo ⊂ R3 are forced to
accordingly move to new positions.

Physically, we say that the corresponding physical medium that occupies the spatial region Uo
and is parametrized by the points of the mathematical subregion Uo ⊂ R3, is subject to consistent

and admissible physical ”stresses” generated by physical interactions mathematically described
by the couple of vector ﬁelds (V, W ), and these physical stresses are quantitatively described by
the corresponding physical interpretation of the mathematical stress tensor M ij(V, W ).

We note that the stress tensor M ij in (1) is subject to the divergence operator, and if we
interpret the components of M ij as physical stresses, then the left hand side of (1) acquires the
physical interpretation of possible force density. Of course, in the static situation as it is given by
relation (1), no energy-momentum propagation is possible, so at every point the forces mutually
compensate. If propagation is allowed then we may identify the right hand side of (1) as a real
time-change of momentum density and appearance of corresponding energy density ﬂow. So,
assuming some expression S for the momentum density/energy density ﬂow of the continuous
physical system described by the couple (V, W ), we are ready to write down some ﬁeld equation
of motion of Newton type through equalizing the corresponding spatially directed force densities
∇iM ij with the momentum density changes (or, energy ﬂow changes) along time coordinate, i.e.
equalizing ∇iM ij with the ct-derivative of S, where c = const is the translational propagation
velocity of the momentum density/energy-density ﬂow of the physical system (V, W ).

This idea we now realize for the electromagnetic ﬁeld, determined by the two vector ﬁelds

(E, B).

3 Nonlinear equations for the electromagnetic ﬁeld

As we mentioned, in the static case, i.e. when the vector ﬁelds (E, B) do not depend on
the time coordinate ξ = ct, NO propagation of ﬁeld momentum density S should take place,
so, at every point, where (E, B) 6= 0, Maxwell stresses must mutually compensate. Therefore
the divergence ∇iM ij should be equal to zero: ∇iM ij = 0. In this static case Maxwell vacuum
equations

a suﬃcient, but NOT necessary, condition that brings to zero the right hand side of (2) through
forcing each of the four vectors to get zero values.
6= 0; ∂B

momentum density should take place, so, full compensation of the generated by the Maxwell
stresses at every spatial point local forces may NOT be possible, which means ∇iM ij 6= 0 in
general. These local forces generate time-dependent momentum propagation/energy density
ﬂow S(E, B) at the spatial points. Therefore, if we want to describe this physical process of ﬁeld
energy-momentum density time change and spatial propagation we have to introduce explicitly
the dependence S(E, B).
If we follow the classical (nonrelativistic) way of consideration and
denote by F the vector ﬁeld with components Fj = ∇iM ij, we can write down the force ﬂow
S F.ds. This ﬂow generates changes of the
across some ﬁnite 2-surface S in the usual way as
energy density ﬂow across S which should be proportional to d
S S(E, B).ds, and the coeﬃcient

The explicit expression for S(E, B) we, paying due respect to Poynting, introduce through the
following

Assumption 1: The ﬁeld energy density ﬂow is given by S := E × B

According to Assumption 1 and the above interpretation of the relation ∇iM ij 6= 0, and

in view of the arbitrariness of the 2-surface S we come to the diﬀerential equation

(cid:21)

The above relation (**) and the corresponding diﬀerential relation (3)/(4) we consider as math-
ematical adequate in energy-momentum terms of the electric-magnetic and magnetic-electric
induction phenomena. We recall that these induction phenomena are described in what we call
”Maxwell theory” by the following well known integral and diﬀerential equations

and these mathematical relations have NO direct energy-momentum change-propagation nature,
so it is not sure that they can be directly veriﬁed in the experiment.

Before to go further we write down the right hand side bracket expression of (4) in the

following two equivalent ways:

∂(−E)

rot B +

× (−B) + Ediv E

.

(5)

(cid:21)

These last two expressions (5) can be considered as obtained from the left hand side of (4) under
the substitutions (E, B) → (B, −E) and (E, B) → (−B, E) respectively.

We are going now to interpret the left hand side of equation (4) in accordance with the view
on equations of motion as stated in the Introduction. Our object of interest Φ is the couple of
vector ﬁelds (E, B). The change object D(Φ) = D(E, B) we deﬁne as

D(E, B) :=

rotE +

; divB

.

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

is suggested by the left hand side of (4) and we deﬁne it by :

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

(cid:20)(cid:18)

∂B

∂B
∂ξ

Hence, the left hand side of (4) determines the momentum that the ﬁeld (E, B) is potentially
able to give to some other physical object without disturbing seriously its own identity, which
quantity is expressed in terms of (E, B) and their derivatives only.
In the case of free ﬁeld,
since no momentum is lost by the ﬁeld, this expression must be equal to zero, hence, in order to
provide ”no destruction” the ﬁeld performs admissible momentum redistribution and appropriate
propagation. In such a case the right hand side of (4) also becomes zero, and in view of its two
equivalent representations (5), we conclude that together with (E, B) one of the ﬁelds (B, −E)
or (−B, E) also is involved in the process of propagation, and it also keeps its energy-momentum
unchanged.

This last interpretation implies a more complicated structure and energy-momentum propa-
gation. In fact, we have now two ﬁelds, (E, B) and (−B, E), or (E, B) and (B, −E), so, mutual
⇄ S(B,−E) between them is now
⇄ S(−B,E), or, S(E,B)
energy-momentum exchange S(E,B)
possible to take place in equal quantities, so that neither of the two ﬁelds to change its energy-
momentum: each one gets locally from the other as much as it loses. In order to involve such
an exchange in the equations we have to introduce the notion of energy-momentum exchange
between any two ﬁelds (E, B) and (G, H) quantitatively in terms of the two ﬁelds. We deﬁne it
through extending the ”projection” P:

Assumption 2. A ﬁeld (E, B) can transfer locally to the ﬁeld (G, H) the following quantity

of energy-momentum:

P

× E + Bdiv H.

(6)

According to this Assumption 2 if the exchange is mutual and in equal quantities, i.e. if
each of the two ﬁelds loses as much energy-momentum as it gains from the other, then this same
quantity should be given by

These equations (10)-(12) we consider as natural Newton type ﬁeld equations. According to
equations (10)-(12) the dynamics of a free electromagnetic ﬁeld is described by two couples
of vector ﬁelds, [(E, B); (−B, E)], or [(E, B); (B, −E)]. Each of the ﬁelds involved keeps its
⇄
momentum unchanged. A mutual exchange of momentum density in equal quantities S(E,B)
S(−B,E), or, S(E,B)

⇄ S(B,−E), may take place.

Note that, if equations (10) and (11) may be considered as ﬁeld-equivalents to the Lorentz
force (eqn. (11)) and its dual (eqn. (10)), this double-ﬁeld viewpoint and the corresponding
mutual energy-momentum exchange described by equation (12) is an essentially new moment.

4 Some Properties of the nonlinear solutions

Clearly, all solutions to Maxwell pure ﬁeld equations (*) are solutions to our nonlinear equations
(10)-(12). Further we shall call these solutions linear, and will not be interested of them. So,
we shall concentrate on those solutions of (10)-(12) which satisfy the conditions

The above two properties are obvious from equations (10) and (11).

3. If (E, B) is a solution then (E′, B′) = (aE − bB; bE + aB), where a, b ∈ R, is also a

solution. This property is immediately veriﬁed through substitution.

4. E2 = B2. To prove this, we ﬁrst multiply equation (10) on the left by E and equation
(12) by B (scalar products). Then we make use of the above properties 1 and 2 and of the vector
algebra relation X.(Y × Z) = Z.(X × Y ).

Properties (1) and (4) say that all nonlinear solutions are null ﬁelds, i.e. the two well known

invariants of the electromagnetic ﬁeld are zero.

To prove this property we ﬁrst multiply (vector product) (12) from the right by E, recall property
1, then multiply (scalar product) from the left by E, recall again E.B = 0, then multiply from
the right (scalar product) by B and recall property 4.

Property (5) suggests the following consideration. If V is an arbitrary vector ﬁeld then the
quantity V.rotV is known as local helicity and its integral over the whole region occupied by V
is known as integral helicity, or just as helicity of V. Hence, property 5 says that the electric and
magnetic components of the nonlinear solution (E, B) generate the same helicities. If we consider
E as 1-form on R3 and denote by d the exterior derivative, then E ∧ dE = E.rotE dx ∧ dy ∧ dz,
so, the zero helicity says that the 1-form E deﬁnes a completely integrable Pfaﬀ system. The
nonzero helicity says that the 1-form E deﬁnes non-integrable 1d Pfaﬀ system, so the nonzero
helicity deﬁnes corresponding curvature. Therefore the equality between the E-helicity and the
R3 B ∧ dB
B-helicity suggests to consider the corresponding integral helicities
(when they take ﬁnite nonzero values) as a measure of the spin properties of the solution.

where φ(x, y, ct + εz) is an arbitrary positive function, lo is an arbitrary positive constant, and
ε and κ take values ±1 independently. The form of this solution suggests to choose the initial
condition φt=0(x, y, εz) in the following way. Let for z = 0 the initial condition φt=0(x, y, 0)
be located on a disk D = D(x, y; a, b; ro) of small radius ro, the center of the disk to have
coordinates (a, b), and the value of φt=0(x, y, 0) to be proportional to the distance R(x, y, 0)
x2 + y2,
between the origin of the coordinate system and the point (x, y, 0), so, R(x, y, 0) =
(x − a)2 + (y − b)2 ≤ ro}. Also, let θD be the smoothed out
and D is deﬁned by D = {(x, y)|
characteristic function of the disk D, i.e. θD = 1 everywhere on D except a very thin hoop-like
zone BD ⊂ D close to the boundary of D where θD rapidly goes from 1 to zero (in a smooth
way), and θD = 0 outside D. Let also θ(z; 2πlo) be the corresponding characteristic function
of an interval (z, z + 2πlo) of length 2πlo on the z-axis. If γ is the proportionality coeﬃcient
then, because of the available sine and cosine factors in the solution, the initial condition for
the solution will occupy a helical cylinder of height 2πlo, having internal radius of ro and wiped
up around the z-axis, also, its center will always be R(a, b, 0)-distant from the z-axis. Therefore
we obtain

φ(x, y, z, ct + εz) = γ.R(x, y, 0).θD.θ(ct + εz; 2πlo),

so, the solution will propagate translationally - along the coordinate z with the velocity c, and
rotationally - inside the corresponding inﬁnitely long helical cylinder because of the z-dependence
of the available periodical multiples. The curvature K and the torsion T of the screwline through
the point (x, y, 0) ∈ D will be

The rotational frequency ν will be equal to ν = c/2πlo, so we can introduce the period T = 1/ν
and elementary action h = E.T , where E is the (obviously ﬁnite) integral energy of the solution
deﬁned as 3d-integral of the energy density (E2 + B2)/2 = φ2 (see the ﬁgures on p.62 in hep-
th/0403244).

This example presents also a completely integrable diﬀerential (2-dimensional) system, i.e.
there exist two functions f and g such that the Lie bracket [E, B] can be represented in the
form f E + g B. The appropriately normed local helicities 2πl2

Planck’s constant then the relation h = E.T is equivalent to the Planck’s relation E = hν, and
h appears as the (integral) spin of the solution.

5 Discussion and Conclusion

The main idea of the paper is that carrying the Newton way for writing down dynamical equa-
tions for particles in mechanics to writing down dynamical equations for continuous ﬁeld systems
should naturally result to nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations even in non-relativistic theo-
ries. Moreover, clarifying the sense of the information included in these dynamical equations
according to the Newton approach, we come to the conclusion formulated in the Introduction,
namely, we have to mathematically describe those changes of the object considered which are
qualiﬁed as admissible and consistent with the system’s identiﬁcation and with the local energy-
momentum balance relations. In the case of ”free” systems these relations represent the local
energy-momentum conservation properties of the system. The energy-momentum characteristics
are chosen because of their two important properties: they are physically universal and conser-
vative. This means that every physical object carries nonzero energy-momentum and, vice versa,
every quantity of energy-momentum is carried by some physical object. Also, if a physical ob-
ject loses/gains some quantity of energy-momentum then some other physical object necessarily
gains/loses the same quantity of energy-momentum. If this viewpoint is assumed, then the prob-
lem of ﬁnding appropriate dynamical equations for an object reduces mainly to: ﬁrst, getting
knowledge of the potential abilities of the object considered to lose and gain energy-momentum;
second, to create adequate mathematical quantities describing locally these abilities.

The electromagnetic ﬁeld, considered as a continuous physical object of special kind, gives a
good example in this direction since, thanks to Maxwell’s fundamental and summarizing works,
we have all the information needed. The notice of Poynting, showing the importance of the
(deduced from Maxwell equations) vector E × B from local energy-momentum propagation
point of view, has completed the resource of adequate mathematical objects since it appears as
natural complement of Maxwell stress tensor, and allows to write down dynamical ﬁeld equations
having direct local energy-momentum balance sense. However, looking back in time, we see that
this viewpoint for writing down ﬁeld equations has been neglected, theorists have paid more
respect and attention to the ”linear part” of Maxwell theory, enjoying, for example, the exact
but not realistic, and even physically senseless in many respects, plane wave solutions in the
pure ﬁeld case. Therefore, not so long after the appearance of Maxwell equations the photoeﬀect
experiments showed the nonadequacy of the linear part of Maxwell theory as a mathematical
model of electromagnetic ﬁelds producing realistic model-solutions of free ﬁelds. Although the
almost a century long time development of standard quantum and relativistic quantum theories
that followed, a reasonable model-solutions describing individual photons, considered as basic,
spatially ﬁnite and time-stable objects, these theories have not presented so far. Nobody doubts
nowadays that photons really exist, and this very fact suggests to try ﬁrst classical ﬁeld approach
in ﬁnding equations admitting 3d-ﬁnite and time stable solutions with appropriate properties.

The historical perspective suggests to follow the 4-potential approach, but modern knowledge
and experience, and even the Maxwell stress tensor achievements, suggest some diﬀerent views.
In fact, we have all reasons to consider the microobjects as real as all other physical objects,
so, no point-like charges and inﬁnite ﬁeld model-solutions should be considered as adequate.
Since the 4-potential approach does not allow spatially ﬁnite and time stable pure ﬁeld solutions
with photon-like structure and behavior its interpretation as a basic concept does not seem
to be appreciable. Also, the 4-potential approach excludes many solutions of the charge free
Maxwell equations. For example, in relativistic terms the Coulomb ﬁeld is given by the 2-form
F = q
r2 dr ∧ dξ, dF = 0, its Minkowski-dual is ∗F = q sin θ dθ ∧ dϕ, d ∗ F = 0, where F
has a global 4-potential, but ∗F has NO global 4-potential. Now, the 2-parameter family of
2-forms (F, ∗F) = (aF − b ∗ F ; bF + a ∗ F ), a, b ∈ R, gives an inﬁnite number of solutions to
Maxwell equations dF = 0, d ∗ F = 0 admitting NO global 4-potential. Our conclusion is that
the 4-potential can be used as a working tool (wherever it causes no controversy) but not as a
basic concept.

In conclusion, paying due respect to the Newton view on dynamical equations and to the
local energy-momentum conservation law we based our approach on the Maxwell stress tensor
and on the Poynting vector as natural quantities carrying the energy-momentum characteristics
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The natural description in these terms is based on two couples
[(E, B)], [(−B, E)], or [(E, B)], [(B, −E)], and mutual energy-momentum exchange
of ﬁelds:
inside each couple in equal quantities is possible in the free-ﬁeld case. The equations obtained
include all solutions to the charge free Maxwell equations. All new (nonlinear) solutions have
zero invariants. Among the new solutions there are time-stable and spatially ﬁnite ones having
photon-like properties and behavior. The Planck relation E = hν holds for these solutions,
where the constant h appears as an integral helicity of such a solution.

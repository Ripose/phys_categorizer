AN ELECTROMAGNETIC TRINITY FROM
“NEGATIVE PERMITTIVITY” AND
“NEGATIVE PERMEABILITY”

An electromagnetic trinity comprising vacuum, anti–vacuum, and ni-
hility is postulated — after making use of materials with “negative per-
mittivity” and “negative permeability” — to illuminate the structure of
electromagnetic theory, at least insofar as the relationship of phase veloc-
ity with Poynting vector is concerned.

KEYWORDS: Anti–vacuum, Negative permeability, Negative permit-

tivity, Vacuum, Nihility

1 Introduction

Illuminating normally one of the two relevant faces of a wedge by a 10 GHz
beam, Shelby et al. [1] observed that the angle of emergence of the beam from
the other face changed sign when the teﬂon wedge was replaced by one made of
the so–called left–handed material (LHM) [2, 3]. Assuming that their LHM is
homogeneous and isotropic, and virtually disregarding dissipation, they concluded
that it possesses a negative index of refraction.

Never mind that the so–called LHM does not actually possess handedness
[4], and therefore is mis–named. Never mind that this material is actually a
particulate composite [1] containing particles that are not electrically small —
especially when the ﬁber–glass content of the LHM is factored in — and therefore
is not homogenizable into a medium with local response properties [5]. Never
mind also that the LHM is actually anisotropic and must have some scattering
losses.

A negative index of refraction is not needed per se, because all that it connotes
is that the phase velocity is directed opposite to the velocity of energy transport
[6] — as shown in the Appendix. But the phase velocity is an inessential concept
[7], whether in vacuum or in materials. What really matter are the solutions of
Maxwell equations that propagate energy on a desired trajectory, which is chosen
epistemically.

Anyhow, virtually all publications on LHMs that I have come across [1]–[3],
[8]–[10] deal substantively only with non–dissipative materials, with just one ex-
ception [10]. Perhaps, in time to come, samples of these materials with proven
negligible dissipation at some frequency will emerge.
In the meanwhile, they
permit me to postulate an electromagnetic trinity comprising (i) vacuum, (ii)
anti–vacuum, and (iii) nihility. This trinity illuminates the structure of elec-
tromagnetic theory, at least insofar as the relationship of phase velocity with
Poynting vector is concerned.

2 Vacuum

Vacuum, of course, is well–known. Also called free space, it is a matter–free
medium — the substrate on which microscopic electromagnetics is formulated
and later homogenized for macroscopic research [11, 12]. The frequency–domain
constitutive relations of vacuum are speciﬁed as

D(x, y, z, ω) = ǫ0 E (x, y, z, ω)

B(x, y, z, ω) = µ0 H(x, y, z, ω)

,






where x, y and z are the cartesian components of the position vector; ω is the
10−7 H m−1. The
angular frequency; ǫ0 = 8.854
phase velocity and the wavenumber of a plane wave in vacuum are co–parallel.

3 Anti–vacuum

The constitutive relations of anti–vacuum are postulated as

D(x, y, z, ω) =

ǫ0 E(x, y, z, ω)

B(x, y, z, ω) =

µ0 H(x, y, z, ω)

Among the more signiﬁcant properties of anti–vacuum is that the phase velocity
of a plane wave therein is opposite in direction to the wavevector. Hence, anti–
vacuum is complementary to vacuum.

Clearly, anti–vacuum does not exist, but it could be simulated at a particular
spatial frequency as follows: Suppose one could fabricate a LHM whose relative
permittivity scalar ǫr(ω) is purely real–valued at a certain angular frequency ˜ω,
and whose relative permittivity scalar µr(ω) is such that µr(˜ω) = ǫr(˜ω). Let elec-
trically small spheres of this LHM be homogeneously but randomly dispersed in
vacuum. As both mediums would be impedance–matched, the eﬀective constitu-
tive parameters of the particulate composite thus formed would have to satisfy the
relation µef f
1 according to the Bruggeman
formalism [13], provided the volume fraction of the LHM is

(˜ω) [13]. Then, ǫef f

(˜ω) = ǫef f

4 Nihility

Nihility is the electromagnetic nilpotent, with the following constitutive relations

(3)

(4)

D(x, y, z, ω) = 0

B(x, y, z, ω) = 0

.






Wave propagation cannot occur in nihility, because

E(x, y, z, ω) = 0 and
H(x, y, z, ω) = 0 in the absence of sources therein [14, 15]. The directionality

∇ ×
of the phase velocity relative to the wavevector in nihility is thus a non–issue.

∇ ×

The Bruggeman formalism is unable to predict the realization of nihility as a
particulate composite either by mixing anti–vacuum and vacuum, or by mixing
an LHM with an isoimpedant commonplace material (such as teﬂon). This is be-
cause the polarizability and the magnetizability (per unit volume) of an isotropic
dielectric–magnetic sphere embedded in nihility do not depend on the constitutive
parameters of the medium that the sphere is made of.

The Maxwell Garnett formalism [13], however, predicts that a homogeneous
dispersion of electrically small, anti–vacuum spheres in vacuum is eﬀectively

equivalent to nihility, provided the volume fraction of anti–vacuum is 0.25. Con-
versely, if matter were scooped out of anti–vacuum in the form of electrically
small spheres, the resulting Swiss–cheese composite would also mimic nihility,
if the volume fraction of anti–vacuum were 0.75. Thus, nihility too could be
mimicked by particulate composites at ω = ˜ω.

5 Concluding Remarks

Whereas vacuum and anti–vacuum are mutually complementary in regard to the
directionality of the phase velocity with respect to the Poynting vector, that issue
does not arise for nihility because waves cannot propagate inside it. Of the three,
vacuum alone is matter–free. Both anti–vacuum and nihility would have to be
simulated — at a speciﬁc angular frequency — as particulate composites which
would ultimately require the fabrication of virtually non–dissipative LHMs that
are impedance–matched to vacuum. When would this become possible at all, let
alone routinely, is anybody’s guess.

Let us consider an isotropic, dielectric–magnetic, homogeneous medium with relative
permittivity ǫr =
i tan δµ) at a
certain angular frequency ω. Let a, b, m = +√ab, tan δǫ and tan δµ all be positive real,
so that ǫr and µr are in accord with the Lorentz model [1, 16], with ω signiﬁcantly larger
iωt) time–dependence
than the resonant angular frequencies of the medium. The exp(
is implicit. To ensure that dissipation is moderate, let tan δǫ < 0.1 and tan δµ < 0.1.

that the phase velocity is pointed exactly opposite to the common direction of energy

Abstract

The Biot-Savart law is a well-known and powerful theoretical tool used to

calculate magnetic ﬁelds due to currents in magnetostatics. We extend the

range of applicability and the formal structure of the Biot-Savart law to elec-

trostatics by deriving a Biot-Savart-like law suitable for calculating electric

ﬁelds. We show that, under certain circumstances, the traditional Dirichlet

problem can be mapped onto a much simpler Biot-Savart-like problem. We

ﬁnd an integral expression for the electric ﬁeld due to an arbitrarily shaped,

planar region kept at a ﬁxed electric potential, in an otherwise grounded

plane. As a by-product we present a very simple formula to compute the ﬁeld

produced in the plane deﬁned by such a region. We illustrate the usefulness

of our approach by calculating the electric ﬁeld produced by planar regions

of a few nontrivial shapes.

I. INTRODUCTION

The Biot-Savart law [1–4] is one of the most basic relations in electricity and magnetism.

It allows one to determine the total magnetic ﬁeld B at a given point in space as the

superposition of inﬁnitesimal contributions dB, caused by the ﬂow of current I through

an inﬁnitesimal path segment ds, oriented in the same direction as the current. If ˆr is the

position unit-vector pointing from the element of length to the observation point P , then the

total ﬁeld contribution due to a closed circuit C at P is given by a closed line integral [1–4]

B =

µ0I

4π IC

(ds × ˆr)

r2

,

(1)

where µ0 is the permeability of free space and the path of integration is along the wire.

The usefulness of the Biot-Savart law goes far beyond its basic textbook applications.

Equation (1) is a much studied integral form which arises in various interesting physical

problems involving topological defects [5], magnetic ﬂuids [6], amphiphilic monolayers [7],

type-I superconductors [8] and the n-body problem of celestial mechanics [9]. In the frame-

work of classical electrodynamics the Biot-Savart law provides a useful technique to calculate

the magnetic ﬁeld generated by current carrying wires. Equation (1) is quite general, valid

for nonplanar current loops of arbitrary shape. Obviously, the presence of a cross-product

in the formula may introduce some diﬃculties in practical calculations. Ultimately, the

range of problems to which equation (1) can be applied is limited primarily by the diﬃculty

experienced in performing the integrations. These diﬃculties are less serious if the loop C is

ﬂat and if the observation point lies in the plane of the loop. It has been recently shown [10]

that the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld due to an arbitrarily shaped (not self-intersecting),

planar, current carrying wire at a point lying on the wire’s plane can be written as

B =

µ0I

4π IC

dθ
r

.

(2)

Equation (2) is very simple and compact, expressing B in terms of the wire shape r = r(θ),

where θ denotes the polar angle. As shown in reference [10], this basic result expands the

degree of applicability of the Biot-Savart law allowing exact, closed form solutions for a

whole new set of elementary problems.

Based on the general nature of the Biot-Savart law, its connection to recent physics

research topics [6–9], and its success in performing magnetic ﬁeld calcultions, we felt moti-

vated to investigate the following question: is it possible to formulate a Biot-Savart-like law

in electrostatics ? If so, what sort of electrostatic problem could be more easily solved by

such an approach? In this work we address these issues and show, for the ﬁrst time, that it

is indeed possible to formulate a Biot-Savart-type law in the realm of electrostatics.

The formulation we propose is suitable to calculate the electric ﬁeld due to an arbitrary

shaped, planar region maintained at a ﬁxed scalar potencial V, with the rest of the plane

held at zero potential. We show that the calculation of the electric ﬁeld produced by such a

region is analogous to the evaluation of the magnetic ﬁeld due to a ﬂat current carrying wire

of the same shape (ﬁgure 1). We point out that the “brute-force” calculation of the electric

ﬁeld due to such an arbitrarily shaped region, kept at a ﬁxed potential, by directly applying

conventional boundary-value techniques [11] may be quite challenging. The nontrivial na-

ture of the problem comes from the fact that we do not know the surface charge distribution

in advance. Our eletrostatic Biot-Savart law provides a much simpler way to perform this

nontrivial electric ﬁeld calculation, and allows one to borrow many of the standard proce-

dures ordinarily used in the corresponding magnetostatic situation. Therefore, complicated

electrostatic problems may have straightforward solutions, if solved by the Biot-Savart-like

approach we develop here. We stress that, even though our derivation and new results (8)

and (9) presented below are quite simple, they have not been derived in any standard elec-

tromagnetism book or journal publication. This work comes to ﬁll this gap, oﬀering a new

3

and simple tool to perform electric ﬁeld calculations.

As a by-product, we obtain a very compact expression for the electric ﬁeld in the plane

of the ﬂat sheet (see equation (9)), which is as simple as its magnetic ﬁeld counterpart

given by equation (2). Finally, we illustrate our results by explicitly calculating the electric

ﬁeld produced by a constant potential, ﬂat region that has the shape of a regular, n-sided

polygon, for observation points located along its axis of symmetry. The calculation for

the ﬁeld produced in the plane of regions having other peculiar shapes (elliptical, spiral,

regularly undulating) is also presented.

II. ELECTRIC FIELD CALCULATION

Consider an arbitrarily shaped, two-dimensional region, located in the x-y plane, kept

at a ﬁxed potential V while the rest of the plane is held at zero potential (see ﬁgure 2). The

shape of the ﬂat plate is determined by a closed boundary curve C. We want to calculate

the electric ﬁeld caused by this charge conﬁguration at a given observation point P located

by the vector x

E(x) = −∇Φ(x),

(3)

where Φ(x) denotes the electric scalar potential.

Since the scalar potential is speciﬁed everywhere on the x-y plane, we have to solve a

Dirichlet problem [11]. We apply Dirichlet boundary conditions, i.e., GD(x, x′) |z ′=0 = 0,
where GD(x, x′) denotes the Green’s function for Dirichlet conditions, and the primed vector

x′ locates the charge distribution points. Using Green’s theorem and the fact that the volume

charge density ρ(x′) = 0, the electrostatic potential for z > 0 can be expressed in terms of

the value of the potential on the plate Φ(x′) = V [11]

Φ(x) = −

1

4π Z Φ(x′) ∂GD

∂n′ ! da′,

4

(4)

where ˆn′ = −ˆz′ is the outward unit normal and da′ is an inﬁnitesimal area element of the
plate.

By employing the method of images [11], we can easily ﬁnd the Green’s function by

considering the potential in x due to a unit point charge located at a point in the region

z > 0, plus the potential of an image charge placed in a symmetric position in the lower-half

plane z < 0. Through this procedure we calculate (∂GD/∂n′) = (−∂GD/∂z′)|z ′=0 explicitly,
and rewrite equation (4) as

where

Φ(x) =

V
2π

Ω(x),

Ω(x) = Z (−ˆz) · (x′ − x)
|x − x′|3

da′

(5)

(6)

is the solid angle subtended by the surface (ﬂat plate of area a′) spanning the loop C as

seen from x. The sign convention established for the solid angle is the following: Ω(x) is

positive when the observation point P views the “inner” side of the ﬂat plate, in other words,

Ω(x) > 0 if the unit normal points away from P . This sign convention is the same as the

one adopted in references [3,4].

By substituting equations (5) and (6) into the electric ﬁeld equation (3) and using the

well-known relation [12]

we ﬁnally obtain

∇Ω(x) = IC

ds′ × (x − x′)

|x − x′|3

,

E(x) =

V

2π IC

(x − x′) × ds′

|x − x′|3

,

(7)

(8)

where ds′ is an element of length of the integration path C. The direction of the integration

around C is determined by the direction of the outward unit normal via the right-hand

5

rule. Notice that the cross-product in (8) has a reversed order in comparison to the one

that appears in the magnetostatic case (1). This distinction is necessary to give the correct

direction for the electric ﬁeld vector at the observation point P .

Equation (8) is our central result. It allows the calculation of the electric ﬁeld through a

Biot-Savart-type law. Notice that (8) is written in terms of a line integral, so to calculate the

electric ﬁeld we just need to take into account the contributions coming from the boundary

contour C. This result makes the solution of the electrostatic problem much easier. Under

the circumstances studied in this work, the traditional Dirichlet problem can be mapped

onto a Biot-Savart-like problem, a mapping that can simplify considerably the computation

of the electric ﬁeld in many problems of interest.

As it was in the magnetic case [10], a much simpler expression for the ﬁeld can be

obtained if we concentrate our attention in the calculation of the electric ﬁeld at observation

points that lie in the plane of the charge distribution. Using the same arguments as those

presented in reference [10] it can be easily shown that

E(x) =

V

2π IC

dθ
r

ˆz,

(9)

where r = |x − x′|. Equation (9) is a surprisingly simple result. Note that this line integral
expression (9) works for ﬂat charge distributions of any boundary shape, including those

described by curves C which are not single valued functions of θ. In addition, it is valid for

observation points P located either inside or outside the loop C. To illustrate our approach,

in the next section we calculate the electric ﬁeld due to speciﬁc planar charge conﬁgurations

of some representative shapes.

III. ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES

In this section we illustrate the usefuness the the Biot-Savart-like law (8) by discussing

a class of electrostatic problem that is trivially solved by using (8) or (9), but that would

6

require a much more involved solution otherwise. We start by applying equation (8) to

calculate the electric ﬁeld due to a thin, ﬂat plate, which has the shape of a regular n-sided

polygon, inscribed in a circle of radius a (see ﬁgure 3). Consider that the ﬂat plate is located

in the x-y plane with its center at the origin, and that it is maintained at a ﬁxed potential

V . In the plane z = 0 the region outside the plate is held at zero potential. We wish to

compute the electric ﬁeld at a point P in the z-axis.

As discussed in section 2, by inspecting equation (8) we notice that in order to calcu-

late the electric ﬁeld due to this ﬂat conﬁguration, we just need to take into account the

contributions coming from the boundary contour C. Let us analyze this point a little more

carefully: the total electric ﬁeld at point P in the z-axis can be written as the superposition

of the ﬁeld due to n triangles obtained by joining the center of circle to the vertices of the

polygon (ﬁgure 3). If we sum all the contributions from these various triangular paths, we

will be left with the integration around the contour C. This happens because the sense

of integration along their common sides is opposite for two adjacent triangles, making the

contributions from the common sides to cancel. Therefore, after performimg the integration

around all the triangles, the only nonzero contributions come from the n straight edges that

deﬁne the plate’s boundary contour C. With these considerations in mind we turn to the

ﬁeld calculation itself.

When the ﬁeld contributions of the n sides are summed vectorially, the horizontal (x-y

plane) components add to zero. By symmetry, only the vertical components located along

the z-axis will survive. From ﬁgure 3 we verify that the total electric ﬁeld at P is given by

E = n En cos α,

(10)

where En is the net ﬁeld due to just one of the n triangles that compose the polygon

and cos α = a cos (π/n)/qa2 cos2 (π/n) + z2. Considering the fact that the only nonzero

contribution from such triangular path comes from the single edge of the polygon, we employ

7

equation (8) to get

En =

V
π

a sin (π/n)

q[a2 cos2 (π/n) + z2]

.

[a2 + z2]

Using equations (10) and (11) we obtain the total electric ﬁeld along the z-axis

E =

V

2π (

na2 sin (2π/n)

[a2 cos2 (π/n) + z2] √a2 + z2) ˆz.

(11)

(12)

This result is quite handy since it provides, all at once, the calculation of the electric ﬁeld

along the z-axis due to any regular polygon of n sides (equilateral triangle, square, pentag-

onal, etc.). We point out that our electric ﬁeld result (12) agrees with the equivalent (but

conceptually distinct) formula for the magnetic ﬁeld at the axis of an n-sized polygonal,

current carrying circuit, previously obtained in reference [13].

It is worth mentioning that result (12) can also be used compute the magnitude of the

electric ﬁeld along the axis passing through the center of a circular conducting plate of radius

a. This can be easily obtained by taking the limit n → ∞ in equation (12) yielding

E =

V a2

[a2 + z2]3/2

ˆz.

(13)

This limit agrees with reference [14], in which the potential calculation is done solely for the

circular plate, by employing traditional boundary-value problem techniques.

We conclude this section by calling the attention of the reader to the fact that the

calculation of the electric ﬁeld at observation points lying in the plane of ﬂat plates of

various shapes can be obtained, with great facility, by directly using our expression (9).

For example, the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld in the plane of elliptical, spiral shaped and

harmonically deformed circular plates (see ﬁgure 4), kept at a ﬁxed potential V , are readily

obtained by (9). Table 1 displays the values of the electric ﬁeld at observation points P , for

these three characteristic ﬂat regions. So, despite the boundary curve especiﬁc geometry,

the E ﬁeld calculation may be promptly performed by using our Biot-Savart-like approach.

8

In practical terms the diﬃculty of having a complicated boundary shape is not a very serious

obstacle in order to compute E in closed form, as long as the related integrations are not

terribly hard to handle.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this work we show that, under certain circumstances, complicated electrostatic prob-

lems may have straightforward solutions, if solved by a Biot-Savart-like approach. We

consider the general situation in which a ﬂat region of arbitrary shape is kept at a ﬁxed

potential V , in a otherwise grounded plane. The objective is to compute the electric ﬁeld

due to this nontrivial charge distribution at a given point in space. At ﬁrst glance, such

a calculation looks very involved, mainly because we have no prior knowledge about the

precise charge distribution on the planar region. We derived a Biot-Savart-like law suitable

to deal with such electrostatic situation, allowing the calculation of the electric ﬁeld to be

done in a simple fashion.

This Biot-Savart-like law is written in terms of a line integral along the boundary contour

deﬁned by the nonzero potential region, so that the calculation does not require information

about the charge distribution in the bulk. As a by-product, we show that for observation

points located in the z = 0 plane, the Biot-Savart-like expression can be written in a very

simple and compact form, as was the case for similar magnetic ﬁeld calculations recently

published in reference [10]. We illustrate our results by calculating the electric ﬁeld along

the axis of a polygonal ﬂat region of n sides, kept at a constant potential V . In addition,

we calculate the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld in the plane of charged plates presenting

nontrivial boundary geometries such as elliptical, spiral and regularly undulating borders.

In summary, we show that it is possible to deﬁne a Biot-Savart-like in electrostatics. Our

new approach provides an alternative and simple technique to solve a class of complicated

9

boundary value problems in electrostatics.

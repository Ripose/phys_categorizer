Abstract

For the case of a simple face-centered-cubic photonic crystal of homogeneous
dielectric spheres, we examine to what extent single-sphere Mie resonance
frequencies are related to band gaps and whether the width of a gap can be
enlarged due to nearby resonances. Contrary to some suggestions, no spectac-
ular eﬀects may be expected. When the dielectric constant of the spheres εs
is greater than the dielectric constant εb of the background medium, then for
any ﬁlling fraction f there exists a critical εc above which the lowest lying Mie
resonance frequency falls inside the lowest stop gap in the (111) crystal direc-
tion, close to its midgap frequency. If εs < εb, the correspondence between
Mie resonances and both the (111) stop gap and a full gap does not follow such
a regular pattern. If the Mie resonance frequency is close to a gap edge, one

I. INTRODUCTION

Photonic crystals, i.e., dielectrics with spatial periodicity, have triggered much interest
recently [1–4]. One can picture a photonic crystal as a periodic arrangement of dielectric
scatterers. For example, its dielectric constant ε(r) equals εs for r inside the scatterer and
εb otherwise. Similarly to the case of an electron moving in a periodic potential, a photon
traveling in a photonic crystal encounters a periodicaly changing dielectric constant. As a
result, a gap can open in the electromagnetic wave spectrum, independent of its polarization
and direction of propagation [3,4]. In a given frequency interval the density of states (DOS)
can either be reduced down to zero (photonic band gap) or enhaced with respect to its
vacuum value. Such a change in the DOS aﬀects many physical quantities. The most
transparent is the change in the spontaneous emission (SE) rate of embedded atoms and
molecules. This can be demonstrated already at a relatively low refractive index contrast
1.15) [5]. Suppression of the SE may have applications for semiconductor lasers, solar
(
≈
cells, heterojunction bipolar transistors, and thresholdless lasers [1]. On the other hand,
the enhancement of the SE is a way to create new sources of light for ultra-fast optical
communication systems [6]. Unlike conventional (electronic) crystals, photonic crystals are
essentially man-made structures and their parameters can be changed at will. There is a
common belief that in the near future such systems will allow us to perform many functions
with light that ordinary crystals do with electrons.

Thus far, the main emphasis in the study of photonic crystals has been on calculating
the band structure [3,7–9]. Let f be the scatterer ﬁlling fraction, i.e., the volume of the
scatterer(s) in the unit cell per unit cell volume. Once f is ﬁxed, the spectrum is only a
function of the dielectric contrast δ = max(εs/εb, εb/εs). In our paper we pose the question
of to what extent the single sphere resonance frequencies are related to band gaps, whether
a gap width can be enlarged due to nearby resonances, and what other eﬀects, if any, single-
scatterer resonances may have on the band structure and properties of a photonic crystal.
In the following, we focus on the case of a simple face-centered-cubic (fcc) photonic crystal
of homogeneous spheres. There are at least two reasons to consider this case. Firstly,
single-sphere resonances, known also as Mie resonances [10], are well understood and an
analytic solution exists for them. In each angular-momentum channel characterized by the
angular-momentum number l a single sphere has an inﬁnite number of Mie’s resonances.
The properties of Mie’s resonances are discussed in many monographs (see, for example,
[11]) and we only emphasize the following ones. The sharpness of a Mie resonance decreases
with increasing σrs, where rs is the sphere radius, σ = ω√εb/c, ω is the frequency, and c is
the speed of light in vacuum. On the other hand, reﬂecting the centrifugal barrier increasing
with l as l(l + 1), the sharpness increases with l. The spacing between resonances in the
higher frequency range is accounted for by the resonance condition σrs = mπ/2, where m
is an integer (if εb = 1).

Secondly, fcc structures of homogeneous spheres are among the most promising candi-
dates to achieve a full photonic gap at optical and near-infrared frequencies. Indeed, in this
frequency range one often uses collodial systems of microspheres which can self-assemble into
three-dimensional fcc crystals with excellent long-range periodicity [12,13]. This long-range
periodicity gives rise to the strong optical Bragg scattering, clearly visible by the naked eye,
and already described in 1963 [14]. Both the case of “dense” spheres (εs > εb) [13] and “air”

2

spheres (εs < εb) [15] can be realized experimentally.

The outline of our paper is as follows. In the next section, main features of the method
that is used to calculate the spectrum of electromagnetic waves in periodic structures are
discussed. We also discuss the diﬀerences between and similarities of the electronic and
electromagnetic bands and give their rough classiﬁcation. In section III we summarize our
numerical results on the eﬀects induced by resonant scattering in a simple fcc crystal of
dielectric spheres. Contrary to the suggestions made previously in the literature [2], no
spectacular eﬀects may be expected. Finally, in section IV our conclusions are presented.

II. RESONANCE SCATTERING AND BAND STRUCTURE OF PHOTONIC
CRYSTALS

Multiple scattering of classical waves in the presence of resonant scatterers was ﬁrst
studied in a disordered medium. There resonances cause a scattering delay due to the
storage of wave energy inside a single scatterer, resulting in a sharp decrease (depending on
the ﬁlling fraction) of the transport velocity vE of light [16]. The discussion of resonance-
induced eﬀects in an ordered medium has been initiated by John [2]. He suggested that
the coinciding resonance and Bragg scattering is the most favourable condition for opening
In the case of spheres this leads to f = 1/(2√δ) [2]. Later on,
a gap in the spectrum.
Zhang and Satpathy [17] noticed that a pseudogap in the band structure of an fcc lattice of
dense spheres corresponds to a Mie resonance. Recently, Ohtaka and Tanabe [18], using the
KKR method described earlier in [22], made an attempt to relate the Mie resonances to the
photonic bands. They paid attention to ﬂat bands which correspond to “heavy photons” in
analogy to their electronic analogue, heavy fermions. For heavy photons, the group velocity
c/100 [18]. The role of Mie resonances in bonding of spheres in photonic
can be as low as
crystals was investigated by Antonoyiannakis and Pendry [19].

∼

In our paper, we shall attempt to investigate the complementary relation to that discussed
by Ohtaka and Tanabe [18], namely, to what extent the single sphere resonance frequencies
are related to band gaps, a question asked ﬁrst by John [2]. In obtaining his result, John
[2] used a simpliﬁed picture in which, regardless of the propagation and polarization, the
photon always encounters precisely the same periodic ε(r) variation, resulting in a one-
dimensional Kronig-Penney’s (KP) model [20]. However, this approximation is only partially
justiﬁed in the short-wavelength limit when light in a sphere behaves like a ﬁeld in a slab
with thickness 2rs. For real crystals the situation is diﬀerent and the above coincidence
condition can only be met in restricted regions on the surface of the Brillouin zone. Also,
with increasing dielectric contrast δ, dispersion curves ω = ω(k) become nonlinear and
the diﬀraction condition is modiﬁed as compared to the Bragg case and fulﬁlled at lower
frequency [13]. Moreover, the model neglects polarization dependent eﬀects.

However, it is quite diﬃcult to relax the simplifying assumptions of the one-dimensional
KP model [20] made by John [2]. In our discussion of resonance-induced eﬀects in photonic
crystals we shall employ the machinery of the on-shell multiple-scattering theory (MST)
(see [21] for electrons and [22] for photons). Note that the on-shell MST is already required
in the one-dimensional KP model if one wants to go beyond the dispersion relation and
obtain Green’s function or the local density of states [23]. The unique feature of the on-

3

shell MST is that, for nonoverlapping (muﬃn-tin) scatterers [21,24] (the present situation), it
disentangles single-scattering and multiple-scattering eﬀects (see [25] for a recent discussion).
For example, the total T-matrix per unit cell can be written in the form [21,22,24,26]

Here all quantities are ordinary matrices. R stands for the on-shell reaction matrix (also
known as the k-matrix [24]) of the scattering sphere (of all scatterers inside the lattice
unit cell in the case of a complex lattice). It is diagonal in the angular-momentum basis
δLL′ tan ηL/σ, where ηL is a phase shift. Here L is a
and can be written as RLL′ =
composite index which labels all the spherical harmonics in the irreducible representation
of the rotation group characterized by the principal angular-momentum number l and, in
the case of electromagnetic waves, it carries an additional polarization dependent index [22].
B = B(σ, k) in Eq. (1) is a matrix of so-called structure constants which accounts for the
periodicity of the lattice. It depends on σ and the Bloch momentum k. The R-matrix is
singular at Mie resonance frequencies and B(σ, k) is singular whenever σ2 = (k + Kn)2,
where Kn is a vector of the dual lattice.

Equation (2) is the familiar Korringa-Kohn-Rostocker (KKR) equation [27] in band structure
theory. Recently, we have succesfully used this approach to calculate the band structure of
electromagnetic waves in a simple fcc lattice of dielectric spheres [9], to establish a simple
analytic formula describing the width of the lowest lying stop gap in the (111) crystal
direction (the L point of the Brillouin zone [28]) [29], and to calculate the properties of the

of lmax is needed to ensure convergence.
In order to reproduce the ﬁrst band and the
linear part of the spectrum, lmax = 1 is enough. In general, the size of a secular equation
is reduced by almost a factor 10 compared with that in the plane-wave method [3,7,8,17]
which customarily requires well above a thousand plane waves. The precision of the elements
of the secular equation is determined by the standard Ewald summation [27] which yields
structure constants up to six digits.

At ﬁrst sight, there seem to be large diﬀerences in band formation between the electrons
and electromagnetic waves. In the case of electrons, in the medium between two atoms, waves
are evanescent in nature, while electromagnetic wave propagates unattenuated between two
scatteres. However, electrons are strongly interacting with each other. If the interactions are
taken into account, an eﬀective-Hamiltonian single-electron picture emerges of a near-free
electron with a positive energy which moves unattenuated between two scatteres like the
electromagnetic wave does [26]. Therefore, the same principles apply to the classiﬁcation
of the electronic and the photonic bands. For electrons, a rough classiﬁcation of the bands
can be obtained if the singularities of R and B are well separated [26]. Thus if R(σ) is
suﬃciently small near a singularity of B(σ, k), where σ = √E and E is the electron energy,
a band is formed with the dispersion relation

+ R(σ).

In more intuitive terms, the formation of such a band results from the formation of standing
waves in a crystal and it is appropriate to call such a band the Bragg band. The second type
of band can form near a singularity of R at ω0, R = Γ/(ω2
ω2
0). This is, for example, the
case in the transition and noble metals. If Γ and B(σ, k) in the vicinity of ω0 are suﬃciently
small, a (usually very narrow) resonance band is formed with the dispersion relation [26]

Eq. (4) is in agreement with the observation made in [18] that the resonance-band width
is comparable with the lifetime broadening of the DOS proﬁle for a single sphere. In more
intuitive terms, formation of the resonance band can be understood as resulting from the
broadening of individual resonances when they start to feel the presence of each other, similar
to the formation of the electronic bands from individual atomic levels in the tight-binding
limit [26]. Such usually very narrow resonance bands describe “heavy photons”.

This shows that one can associate with a resonance a (resonance) band. Is it possible to
associate with a resonance a gap? The answer is yes. However, a hybridization of bands must
take place. We speak of hybridization if the singularities of R and B cannot be well separated
and neither a pure Bragg nor a pure resonance band is formed. Under certain conditions
the two bands can hybridize in such a way as to create a gap over the approximate energy
range of the original unhybridized resonance band. An example of such a hybridization
is provided by transition metals with characteristic d (or f ) resonance which couples with
p band hybridizes
extended band states by tunneling [30]. In the latter case a broad s

of the original unhybridized d resonance band [30].

In the following section, we investigate the hybridization of photonic bands in an fcc
lattice of dielectric spheres. Although the same principles apply to the classiﬁcation of the
photonic bands as to those for electrons, is does not mean that the respective band structures
are qualitatively similar. There is signiﬁcantly diﬃcult to open a gap in the spectrum of
electromagnetic waves than in the case of electrons. Moreover, a gap often does not open
between the lowest lying bands, as in the case of electrons, but in an intermediate region.
The origin of this diﬀerence lies in a diﬀerent behaviour of R and B and can be rather easily
understood. Indeed, in the tight-binding picture of band formation [26], individual bands
results from the broadening of corresponding atomic levels when the atoms start to feel the
presence of each other. The largest gap between atomic levels is between the lowest-lying
energy levels. Therefore, for a lattice of atoms, one expects to ﬁnd a gap essentially between
the ﬁrst and the second energy band, with the gap between higher bands scaling down to
zero. On the other hand, for a dielectric scatterer and Maxwell’s equations, bound states
are absent. They are replaced by resonances. Moreover, if the wavelength is small compared
to the size of the spheres, one can use geometric optics, while in the opposite limit of long
wavelengths, the Rayleigh approximation applies. In neither case does a gap open in the
spectrum. Therefore, if a gap is present in the spectrum, it should be in the intermediate
region between the two limiting cases (see, however, the case of a diamond lattice ( [3], ﬁgure
2), which is a complex lattice). The same applies to the localization of light [2] which is also
expected at some intermediate frequencies.

Since opening of a gap in the spectrum of electromagnetic waves in much diﬃcult than

in the electronic case, one expects also that hybridization will be weaker in the former case.
These expectations are conﬁrmed in the following section.

III. RESULTS FOR AN FCC LATTICE OF DIELECTRIC SPHERES

In our case of an fcc crystal of homogeneous spheres, we looked for a correspondence
between Mie resonance frequencies and (i) the lowest lying stop gap in the (111) crystal
direction (the L point of the Brillouin zone [28]) in the case of both “dense” spheres (εs > εb)
and “air” spheres (εs < εb), (ii) the full gap in the case of “air” spheres. (Note that there
is no full gap in the case of “dense” spheres [7,9].) Apart from numerous experimental data
now available [13,31], there are at least two other reasons to chose the L-gap. First, the width
of the ﬁrst stop gap often takes on its maximum at the L point and, second, experimental
techniques make it possible to grow collodial crystals such that the L direction corresponds
to normal incidence on the crystal surface.

In the case of “dense” spheres we found that for suﬃciently high dielectric contrast δ the
L-gap can be associated with the 1M1 resonance. (Our notation lAn for a Mie resonance
is such that l is the angular momentum, A stands for either electric (E) or magnetic (M)
mode, and n is the order of the resonance with increasing frequency in a given lA channel.)
For all ﬁlling fractions one ﬁnds that as δ increases over a critical value (see Figure 1), the
1M1 resonance “descends” from above to the L-gap and stays inside it close to the midgap
frequency. We veriﬁed this behaviour for δ up to 100.

In the case of “air” spheres the hybridization of bands is much less pronounced compared
to the case of “dense” spheres. We observe a correspondence between the L-gap and a Mie
resonance only for particular ﬁlling fractions and dielectric contrasts. Filling fraction f
0.5
or higher is required for hybridization to occur. However, for a given f , the required dielectric
contrast for the onset of hybridization can be as little as half the value for the dense sphere
case. For f = 0.6 one ﬁnds the 1E1 resonance trapped inside the L-gap already for δ
8.
In the close-packed case the lowest lying 1E1 resonance descends actually below the L-gap
and, if δ
16, a hybridization occurs at the frequency corresponding to the second, 1M1,
≥
resonance.

≈

Hybridization in the case of the lowest L-gap is only partial since the gap does not
extend over the whole Brillouin zone. Let us, therefore, look at the full band gap which
can be opened only in the air sphere case (one can open just a single full gap here [7,9]).
In contrast to that of the L-gap, the opening of the full gap requires a certain threshold
dielectric contrast which rapidly increases as f decreases from the close-packed case [7,9]
(see ﬁgure 2). Hybridization follows the irregular pattern seen in the case of the L-gap. For
example, for f = 0.6 hybridization occurs if δ
36 where the 2M1 resonance descends from
≥
above to the full gap, soon followed by the 3E1 resonance (2M1 < 3E1). Both resonances
seem to be locked inside the full gap (at least up to δ = 100).
Interesting behaviour is
found for f = 0.64. First, the full gap opens at δ
10.6 between the closely lying 2M1 and
3E1 resonances. As εb increases, the 3E1 resonance moves across the gap and stays closely
below the lower edge of the full gap. Hybridization around the 3E1 resonance occurs only
for δ = (11.5, 13). Outside this interval of δ no resonance is inside the full gap. The case in
which f = 0.68 shows an anomalous behaviour: no resonance frequency is inside the full gap

or close to the the full gap edge. On the other hand, in the close-packed case (f
can ﬁnd three closely lying resonances, namely, 3M1, 4E1, and 1E2 (3M1 < 4E1 < 1E2),
inside the full gap. 3M1 descends to the full gap around εb = 12, soon followed by the 4E1
and 1E2 resonances. For εb > 16 all three resonances are already inside the full gap and
seem to remain trapped there (at least up to εb = 100).

≈

Apart from the hybridization, another intriguing issue is that of whether the width of a
gap can be enlarged due to the Mie resonances as the one-dimensional KP model suggests
[2]. Once a resonance was inside a gap we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant eﬀect on the gap
width. A good illustration of this is the behaviour of the relative width ∆r of the full gap
(the full gap width divided by the midgap frequency) at f = 0.68 on the one hand and
f = 0.6, 0.64 and 0.74 (close-packed) on the other hand (see ﬁgure 2). In the ﬁrst case, the
gap does not correspond to any Mie resonance, while in the second case, there are up to
three Mie resonances inside the gap. Had there been some eﬀect of a Mie resonance on the
gap width, one would have observed either a sudden increase in ∆r after hybridization sets
in, or an anomalously small gap width for f = 0.64 (if δ > 13) and f = 0.68. Instead, one
sees a monotonical increase of ∆r as δ and f increase. However, something diﬀerent may
happen if a Mie resonance frequency is close to a gap edge, before hybridization sets in.
Under certain circumstances one can observe a resonance-induced widening of a relative gap
width by up to 5%. Figure 3 shows the relative L-gap width ∆r
L for air spheres and f = 0.6.
Around δ = 7.99 the 1E1 resonance crosses the upper edge of the L-gap, which results in
a local enhancement of ∆r
5%. As a function of δ, this widening occurs within the
(7.986, 7.998) where it shows a ﬂat peak. In the air-sphere case
very narrow interval of δ
one can be sure that this widening of a gap can be entirely attributed to a resonance. As
shown recently [29], the lowest lying L-gap for an fcc lattice of dielectric spheres can be
understood in terms of simple quantities, namely, the volume averaged dielectric constant,
ε = f εs + (1
b], and the eﬀective
dielectric constant εeff . The eﬀective dielectric constant can be well approximated [9,32] by

IV. CONCLUSION

Using the photonic analog of the KKR method [9,22], we have investigated Mie-
resonance-induced eﬀects for an ordered medium, namely, for a simple fcc lattice of homo-
geneous spheres in three dimensions. Our work partially ﬁlls the gap in the understanding
of resonance-induced eﬀects compared to a disordered medium [16]. We showed that the
same principles apply to the classiﬁcation of both electronic and electromagnetic bands in
a periodic medium, although their respective qualitative behaviour may be diﬀerent. For
example, due to the absence of bound states for a single scatterer, it is much more diﬃcult
to open a full gap in the spectrum of electromagnetic waves than for the case of electrons.
Still, under certain conditions, one can identify a resonance band, and a hybridization of
the Bragg and resonance bands can take place, leaving behind a gap over the approximate
energy range of the original unhybridized resonance band [30]. We investigated both a par-
tial hybridization in the case of the ﬁrst stop gap in the (111) crystal direction (the L-gap)
and a full hybridization in the case of the full band gap. For dense spheres (εs > εb), partial
hybridization around the lowest Mie resonance occurs for all ﬁlling fractions f , once the
dielectric contrast δ reaches a critical value δc(f ) (see Figure 1). For air spheres (εs < εb),
the hybridization follows an irregular pattern and it can be observed only if f
0.5. How-
ever, the value δc(f ) can be as little as half the corresponding δc(f ) in the dense-sphere
case. Near close packing (f
0.74), the partial hybridization occurs around the second Mie
resonance. The full hybridization in the case of air spheres (there is no full gap in the dense
sphere case [7–9]) follows again the irregular pattern seen in the case of partial hybridization.
Sometimes the full gap opens in a frequency region which does not correspond to any Mie
resonance (f = 0.68), but in other situations there are up to three Mie resonances in the
frequency range corresponding to the full gap (f = 0.74). The resonant-induced widening of
a gap can occur if a Mie resonance is about to cross the edge of the gap (see Figure 3). The
values of the dielectric contrast required to observe some of these eﬀects are within exper-
imental reach at microwaves and, in the air-sphere case, even at optical and near-infrared
frequencies. However, unlike in the case of the one dimensional Kronig-Penney model [2],
we did not ﬁnd any evidence that if some of Mie resonance frequencies fall inside a gap,
then this leads to its signiﬁcant widening. Contrary to the suggestions made previously in
the literature [2], no spectacular eﬀects may be expected. This is probably related to the

≈

≥

8

known fact that the hybridization of bands in higher dimensions is weaker [30]. Also, since
the opening of a gap in the spectrum of electromagnetic waves in much diﬃcult than in the
electronic case, it is natural that also hybridization eﬀects are weaker in the photonic case.

FIG. 3. The relative L-gap width ∆r

L (the L-gap width divided by the midgap frequency) for
an fcc lattice of air spheres with the sphere ﬁlling fraction f = 0.6 plotted against the refractive
index contrast √δ. Around δ = 7.99, the 1E1 resonance crosses the upper edge of the L-gap which
results in a local enhancement of the relative L-gap width, which is shown as a very narrow peak
in the main ﬁgure. The inset shows the detailed view of the peak.

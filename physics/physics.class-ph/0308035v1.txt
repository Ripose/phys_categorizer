Abstract

It will be shown that it is not the case that special relativity claims something new about
space-time—in comparison with the pre-relativistic Galileo-invariant conceptions—, but sim-
ply calls something else “space-time”, and that something else has diﬀerent properties. All
statements of special relativity about those features of reality that correspond to the origi-
nal meaning of the terms “space” and “time” are identical with the statements of classical
physics. Thus the birth of special relativity—as a theory of space-time—was a terminological
turn, rather than a revolution in our conception of space and time.

Key words: special relativity, space-time, operationalism

Introduction

I have for long thought that if I had the opportunity to teach this subject, I would emphasize
the continuity with earlier ideas. Usually it is the discontinuity which is stressed, the radical
break with more primitive notions of space and time. Often the result is to destroy completely
the conﬁdence of the student in perfectly sound and useful concepts already acquired. (From J.
S. Bell: “How to teach special relativity”, Bell 1987, p. 67.)

For physics, time and space (distance) are ordinary—although fundamental—physical quanti-
ties which must have deﬁnite empirical meaning. To be sure, ’What is time and what is space?’ is
a philosophical question par excellence. There is no deﬁnite answer to the question ’What kind of
physical quantities can adequately represent the various aspects of time and space perceptions?’
And, as in case of any other physical quantities, there is a conventional element in the meanings of
the terms “distance” and “time”: the semantical freedom we have in the use of the uncommitted
signs “distance” and “time”—a freedom what Grnbaum (1974, p. 27) calls “trivial semantical con-
ventionalism”. Nevertheless, when the physicist assigns time and space tags to an event, relative
to a reference frame, (s)he is already after the metaphysical considerations, and means deﬁnite
physical quantities with already settled empirical meanings.

According to the usual textbook approach, the emergence of Einstein’s special relativity was a
discovery of new facts of nature: Certain experimental ﬁndings necessitate to draw the conclusion
that the geometry of space-time is something diﬀerent from what we believed before. This view
can ﬁnd support in Einstein’s famous popular book on special and general relativity. At the end of
Section 13 Einstein regards Fizeau’s experiment as an “experimentum crucis” in favour of theory
of relativity (Einstein 1920a, p. 28). The next section then begins with the following summary:

1

Experience has led to the conviction that, on the one hand, the principle of relativity
holds true and that on the other hand the velocity of transmission of light in vacuo has
to be considered equal to a constant c. By uniting these two postulates we obtained
the law of transformation for the rectangular co-ordinates x, y, z and the time t of
the events which constitute the process of nature.
In this connection we did not
obtained the Galilei transformation, but, diﬀering from classical mechanics, the Lorentz
transformation. (Einstein 1920b, p. 41)1

According to this interpretation of special relativity, the story can be described by the following
logical schema: Earlier we believed in F (x) (where x stands for space-time and F denotes some
property). Then we discovered that ¬F (x) but G(x) (where G denotes some other property).

Contrary to this common view, the main thesis of this paper is the following:

Thesis Special relativity tells us nothing new about the geometry of space-time—in comparison
with the pre-relativistic Galileo-invariant conceptions—, but simply calls something else “space-
time”, and that something else has, of course, diﬀerent properties. All statements of special rela-
tivity about those features of reality that correspond to the original meaning of the terms “space”
and “time” are identical with the traditional pre-relativistic statements.

Thus the only novelty in the special relativistic account of space-time is a terminological proposal
In other words: Earlier we believed in F (x). Then we
to call something else “space-time”.
discovered for some y 6= x that ¬F (y) and G(y). Consequently, it still holds that F (x).

Empirical deﬁnitions of space and time coordinates in clas-
sical physics and in special relativity.

A Priori it is quite clear that we must be able to learn something about the physical
behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks from the equations of transformation, for the
magnitudes z, y, x, t, are nothing more nor less than the results of measurements
obtainable by means of measuring-rods and clocks. (Einstein 1920b, p. 35)

According to the spirit of the above quotation, let us clarify the empirical deﬁnitions of space and
time coordinates in classical physics and in special relativity. Denote K the reference frame in
which the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Paris is at rest, together with
the etalons (the standard measuring-rod, the standard clock, etc.), and let K ′ be a frame moving
with constant velocity v relative to K. We are interested in the operational reconstruction of the
space and time coordinates deﬁned in both frames K and K ′—according to special relativity and
according to the classical Galileo-invariant conceptions. For the sake of simplicity consider only
one space dimension and assume that the origin of both K and K ′ is at the BIPM at the initial
moment of time.

(D1) Time coordinate in K according to the classical conceptions

Take a synchronized copy of the standard clock at rest in the BIPM, and slowly move
it to the locus of event A. The time tag tK (A) is the reading of the transfered clock
when A occurs.2

1In other writings Einstein seems to agree with other views according to which the switch to the relativistic
theory of space-time is a convention, rather than an unambiguous theoretical conclusion drawn from the empirical
facts. See Einstein 1983, p. 35; Einstein 1969, p. 57. Cf. Bell 1992, p. 34; Brown and Pooly 2001; Friedman 1983,
p. 293. Nevertheless, all these approaches share the conviction that what special relativity claims about space and
time is something diﬀerent from the classical theory.

2With this deﬁnition we actually use the standard “ε =

1
2 -synchronization”. I do not want to enter now into
the question of the conventionality of simultaneity, which is a hotly discussed separate problem. (See Reichenbach
1956; Grnbaum 1974; Salmon 1977; Malament 1977; Friedman 1983.)

Now we are going to prove that it is not the case. The contingent fact what we have to take
into account is the Lorentz transformation which expresses a relationship between the measuring
data
. The Lorentz transformation is a consequence of the
distortions of the meter sticks and the clocks when they are moved from the BIPM to K ′. These
distortions are known from diﬀerent experimental ﬁndings. For example, 1) from the perpendicular
1 − v2
Doppler eﬀect we know that the standard clock (atomic clock) slows down by factor
c2
when it is gently accelerated from K to K ′ (Jnossy 1971, p. 37). 2) From the Michaelson–
q
c2 when it is
Morley experiment we know that a rigid rod suﬀers a contraction by factor
gently accelerated from K to K ′. Taking into account these eﬀects, one can directly calculate
(A), following deﬁnitions (D6)–(D7). First, let us calculate the
the coordinates
reading of the clock slowly transported in K ′ from the origin to the locus of an event A. We will

Thus, we have shown that diﬀerent physical quantities are called “space coordinate”, and simi-

2. The above calculation reveals the intuition behind (D5) versus (D6) and (D7). The operations
in deﬁnitions (D6) and (D7) are just the blind repetitions of the operations in (D1) and (D2),
simply ignoring the fact that a clock suﬀers a loss of phase and a meter stick suﬀers a contraction
when they are moved from the BIPM to the moving frame K ′. Notice that in this way, disregarding
the distortions of the equipments, we ﬁnd the “speed of light relative to K ′” to be equal to c.

Deﬁnition (D5), on the contrary, does take into account that the etalon measuring equipments
suﬀer distortions when they are accelerated from K to K ′. That is why the space and time tags
in K ′ are deﬁned through the original space and time data, measured by the original distortion
free equipments, being at rest relative to the BIPM. As it turns out from the above calculations,
one would ﬁnd the same xK ′
(A) if the space and time tags were measured with the
co-moving equipments, just like in (D6) and (D7), but—according to the conventional propriety—
with compensations of the distortions.

In saying that the “space coordinates” and “time coordinates” in relativity theory are not the
same physical quantities, it is necessary to guard against a possible misunderstanding. I mean
something entirely diﬀerent from the incommensurability thesis of the relativist philosophy of sci-
ence (see Kuhn 1970, Chapter X; Feyerabend 1970). Quite the contrary, we have to recognize that
xK ′
(A) and tK ′
(A) are meaningful physical quantities for special relativity, too, and—assuming

of this fact.

that special relativity is a suﬃciently complete account of physical reality—we can legally query
the values of these quantities, and can compare them with the classical concepts. The two theories
are completely commensurable.

So, special relativity tells us something new about space and time only if it accounts for the
(A) diﬀerently. From the mere fact, however, that special relativity calls

Now we are ready to prove that special relativity is not a new theory of space and time. In order
to see this, consider how special relativity describes the space and time tags xK ′

utilize the operational identities (1) and (2), and we can express everything through xK and tK.

To sum up, having clariﬁed the empirical meaning of the terms “space” and “time”, it turned
out that all statements of special relativity about those features of reality that correspond to
the traditional meaning of the terms are identical with the traditional pre-relativistic statements.
Thus, special relativity does not bear “a revolution in our conception of space and time”. It is
only a rather innocent (at least from the point of view of physics) proposal to call something else
“space” and “time”.

Comments

1. What is new then in special relativity, if, as we have seen, it does not tell us anything new
about space and time? It does describe the physics of objects moving at constant velocities—in
accordance with the title of Einstein’s original 1905 paper. I do not want to enter now into the
historic question of to what extent Einstein’s fundamental work was new—in comparison with the
similar works of his contemporaries like, FitzGerald, Larmor, Poincare, and, ﬁrst of all, Lorentz.
My concern is only the essential physical content of their discoveries (see Szab 2003a), namely that
physical objects suﬀer distortions when they are gently accelerated from one inertial frame to the
other. As we have seen, such distortions of the standard clock and the standard measuring-rod
cause the diﬀerence between the “space” and “time” tags xK ′
(A) and
xK ′
(A). The most fundamental thesis of special relativity, the special
1 (A),
relativity principle (the Lorentz covariance principle), is a claim about how the physical properties
of a physical object change, when the object, as a whole, is set in motion. Recall how Einstein
e
formulates the special relativity principle:

If, relative to K, K ′ is a uniformly moving co-ordinate system devoid of rotation, then
natural phenomena run their course with respect to K ′ according to exactly the same
general laws as with respect to K. (Einstein 1920b, p. 15)

More speciﬁcally,

According to the special relativity principle the laws of Nature must be covariant
relative to Lorentz transformations; the theory thus provides a criterion for general
laws of Nature. (Einstein 1979, p. 54)

In his 1905 paper, Einstein himself shows many examples of how to understand and how to apply
this principle: Consider a physical object at rest in an arbitrary inertial frame K ′. Assume
we know the relevant physical equations and know the solution of the equations describing the
physical properties of the object in question when it is at rest—all these things are expressed
xK ′
, . . .. We now inquire as to the same physical properties of the
2 ,
in the terms of
velocity relative to K ′. In other words the question
object when it is moving at a given constant
is how these physical properties are modiﬁed when the object is in motion. Applying the special
e
relativity principle (Lorentz covariance), we can solve the problem in the following way. It follows
g
from the Lorentz covariance of the equations of physics describing the system, that the same
xK ′′
, . . . deﬁned in the co-moving
equations hold for the double-primed variables
1
inertial frame K ′′. On the other hand, since the moving object is at rest in the co-moving reference
frame K ′′, the same solution holds for the double-primed variables. Finally, we can express the
e
e
xK ′
, . . . of K ′ by applying the Lorentz
1 ,
double-primed variables through the original
transformation.6 Usually, in this way we solve the problem of the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a moving
point charge, the Lorentz deformation of a rigid body, the loss of phase suﬀered by a moving clock,
the dilatation of the mean life of a cosmic ray µ-meson, etc.

6Actually the situation is much more complex. The reason is that this usual consideration ignores the question of
the initial conditions. Whether or not the solution thus obtained is correct depends on the details of the relaxation
process after the acceleration of the system. (See Szab 2003b)

2. Many mistakenly believe that the Lorentz contraction and the time dilatation are not real
physical changes, but they are just obtained from the comparison of quantities deﬁned in diﬀerent
reference frames. (At the same time, however, the reality of the change of the electric ﬁeld of a
point charge when we set it in motion, and the reality of the dilatation of the mean life of a µ
-meson are usually not questioned.) Of course, the deformation of a moving object in relativity
theory is as real as any other change of a physical system, associated with its motion; without
these real deformations the Lorentz covariance could not be satisﬁed. Such a question, for example,
length (length) of the rod has changed can be answered only by comparing
whether or not the
the earlier
length (length) in the very same inertial frame.
One cannot argue that there is no real deformation only because there exists some other reference
frame K ′′ (as it happens, the co-moving one) such that

Arguing in this way would be as absurd as to say that a rod which is continuously at rest in K ′
becomes deformed only because there is another frame K ′′ such that
. Thus, equation

deformation of the rod.

3. Another source of confusion is that the “contraction of a rod” and the “phase shift of a clock”
can be observed by an observer also if the object is at rest but the observer is in motion at constant
velocity. And these “relativistic deformations” cannot be explained as real physical deformations
of the object at rest—the objection says. There is a triple misunderstanding behind such an
objection: 1) Of course, no real distortion is suﬀered by an object which is continuously at rest
relative to a reference frame K ′, and, consequently, which is continuously in motion at a constant
velocity relative to another frame K ′′. None of the observers can observe such a distortion. For

just like velocity, for instance, is a reference-frame-dependent concept in the Galileo-invariant
classical physics. This fact, however, does not express a contraction of the rod—neither a real nor
an apparent contraction. 3) On the other hand, inequality (15) is a consequence of the real physical
distortions suﬀered by the measuring equipments with which the
time coordinates are
operationally deﬁned, when they are adiabatically transfered from the BIPM to the diﬀerent other
reference frames in question.

4. Due to the popular/textbook literature on relativity theory, there is a widespread aversion to
a privileged reference frame. However, like it or not, there exists a privileged reference frame in
both special relativity and classical physics. It is the frame of reference in which the International
Bureau of Weights and Measures is at rest. It is not privileged by nature but it is privileged by
the trivial semantical convention providing meanings for the terms “distance” and “time”, by the
fact that from all possible measure sticks and clocks of the universe, as etalons, we have chosen
the ones ﬂoating together with the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris. This
privileged reference frame, however, has nothing to do with the concepts of “absolute rest” or the
aether.

Many believe that one can avoid the reference to the etalons of a privileged frame by deﬁning,
time for an arbitrary (moving) frame of reference K ′ through a cesium
for example, the unit of
clock, or the like, co-moving with K ′. That is, however, not the case. Such a deﬁnition has several

the laws governing the behaviour of the cesium clocks are Lorentz covariant, etc. The validity of
such contingent statements cannot be empirically tested without comparing the readings of the
diﬀerent cesium clocks with one standard clock.

New stationary solutions of the (Mihelson) Sivashinsky equation of premixed (cid:29)ames are obtained

numerially in this paper. Some of these solutions, of the bioalesent type reently desribed

by Guidi and Marhetti, are stable with Neumann boundary onditions. With these boundary

onditions, the time evolution of the Sivashinsky equation in the presene of a moderate white

noise is ontrolled by jumps between stationary solutions.

INTRODUCTION

The Sivashinsky equation [1℄ (or Mihelson Sivashinsky equation depending on the au-

thors) is a well established non linear equation whih provides a satisfatory desription of

the time evolution of premixed (cid:29)ames. Until working on the present paper, the author had

a very simple idea of the situation regarding this equation. Pole solutions of the Sivashinsky

equation were obtained in [2℄ and popularized in [3℄, whih redues the time evolution of

the equation to a dynamial system and the stationary solutions to (cid:28)nding zeroes of a non

linear funtion of several variables. The paper [3℄ also shows that the poles have a tendeny

to oalese, i.e. to align vertially in the omplex plane. Stationary solutions were obtained

in the form of oalesent solutions with a number of poles depending on the width of the

domain. It was shown analytially in [4℄[5℄ that eah solution, with a given number of poles

is linearly stable in a given interval for the ontrol parameter (either the domain width or

more often the urvature term with a domain width (cid:28)xed to 2π). Numerial simulations

however, always performed with periodi boundary onditions, ontinue to show that the

solutions are extremely sensitive to noise [6℄ for su(cid:30)iently large domains. These results are

onsistent with a qualitative desription of the stability of urved (cid:29)ame fronts by Zeldovih

et. al. [7℄.

For some reason, the author of the artile began simulations of the Sivashinsky equation

with Neumann boundary onditions, ie. zero slope of the (cid:29)ame front at eah end of the

domain. Of ourse, Neumann boundary onditions are a more realisti desription of a (cid:29)ame

in a tube than periodi boundary onditions. However, as solutions with Neumann boundary

onditions on [0, π] are simply symmetri solutions with periodi boundary onditions on

[0, 2π], the author was thinking that he should obtain basially a oalesent solution, but only

between 0 and π , with all the poles oalesing at 0, leading to a usp at this boundary. It was

so obvious that atually simulations of the Sivashinsky equation with Neumann boundary

onditions were only used originally as a test ase for a new omputer program. However

stationary solutions were obtained, where poles did not all oalese at the same position,

but atually on the two boundaries.

It turns out (although the author was absolutely unaware of this paper at the beginning

of his work) that this type of stationary solutions, alled bioalesent solutions, were already

disovered by Guidi and Marhetti [8℄. In Setion II, we show the new bioalesent solutions

2

that we have obtained, whih have a nie property with Neumann boundary onditions, they

are stable. These solutions were not found in [8℄ beause the urvature parameters studied

were too large (or equivalently, the domain width was too small). In Setion III, we show

where the new solutions of Setion II are found in the parameter spae. We have thus to

study a larger domain of the parameter spae than in [8℄, and disover also new stationary

solutions of the interpolating type desribed by Guidi and Marhetti (see setion III for a

de(cid:28)nition of this type of solution). These interpolating solutions, unlike those of Setion II,

are unstable. The number of stationary solutions obtained is so large that we have entitled

Setion III web of stationary solutions and will try to onvine the reader that this is not an

exageration. In Setion IV, the evolution of the Sivashinsky equation with noise is studied.

In the ase of Neumann boundary onditions, as expeted, the stable bioalesent solutions

play a dominating role in the dynamis. Finally, Setion V ontains a onlusion.

II. STABLE BICOALESCENT SOLUTIONS

The Sivashinsky equation an be written as

φt +

φ2
x = νφxx + I (φ)

1
2

where φ (x) is the vertial position of the front. The Landau operator I (φ) orresponds
| in Fourier spae, where k is the wavevetor, and physially to the

to a multipliation by |

k

destabilizing in(cid:29)uene of gas expansion on the (cid:29)ame front (known as the Darrieus-Landau

instability). ν is the only parameter of the equation and ontrols the stabilizing in(cid:29)uene of

urvature. The linear dispersion relation giving the growth rate σ versus the wavevetor is,

inluding the two e(cid:27)ets:

(1)

(2)

As usual with Sivashinsky-type equations, the only non linear term added to the equa-

1

2 φ2

q

tion is

x . In the (cid:29)ame front ase, this term is purely geometrial : the (cid:29)ame propagates

in the diretion of its normal, a pro jetion on the vertial (y ) diretion gives the fator

cos (θ) = 1/

1 + φ2

x , where θ is the angle between the normal and the vertial diretion,

then a development valid for small slopes of the front leads to the term

equation will be solved numerially on [0, 2π] with periodi boundary onditions, or (more

often in this paper) on [0, 2π] with only symmetri modes, whih orresponds to homoge-

neous Neumann boundary onditions on [0, π] (zero slope on both ends of the domain).

All dynamial alulations will be performed by Fourier pseudo-spetral methods (i.e. the

non linear term is alulated in physial spae and not by a onvolution produt in Fourier

spae). The method used is (cid:28)rst order in time and semi-impliit (impliit on the linear terms

of the equation, expliit on

x ). No partiular treatment of aliasing errors has been used.

where N is the number of poles zn(t) in the omplex plane. Atually the poles appear in

omplex onjugate pairs, and the asterisk in Equation 3 denotes the omplex onjugate. In

all the paper, only poles with a positive imaginary part will be shown, the number of poles

will also mean number of poles with a positive imaginary part. The pole deomposition

transforms the solution of the Sivashinsky equation into the solution of a dynamial system

for the loations of the poles. In the ase of stationary solutions, the loations of the poles

are obtained by solving a non linear system:

· · ·

where Im (zn) denotes the imaginary part and sgn is the signum funtion. This non linear

system will be solved by a Newton-Raphson method.

Let us de(cid:28)ne here a proess that will be alled folding in the rest of the paper and whih

allows to reate ellular solutions starting from urved (cid:29)ame fronts (i.e.

fronts with only

one ell in [0, 2π]). If a solution φ1 (x) of the Sivashinsky equation exists with parameter
1/ν1 , then φ2 (x) = 1

m φ1 (mx) is a solution of the Sivashinsky equation with parameter

1/ν2 = m (1/ν1),with m integer.

Although we have searhed for stationary solutions with periodi boundary onditions, it

appears that all the solutions we have found on [0, 2π] are symmetri, and thus are stationary

solutions with Neumann boundary onditions, i.e. zero slope, on [0, π]. In most of the ases

the stationary solutions obtained have poles at x = 0, in a few ases however, the solutions

have no poles on the boundaries (i.e. only lead to symmetri solutions with no poles at the

boundary)

With periodi boundary ondition, the well-known result is that in the window 2n

1
≤
· · · there exists n di(cid:27)erent monooalesent stationary solutions (all
the poles have the same real part), with 1 to n poles, and the solution with the maximum

2n + 1, n = 1, 2,

number of poles n is asymptotially stable. For a partiular value of 1/ν , the number n(ν)

suh that 2n

2n+1 will be alled the optimal number of poles. All stable solutions

−

≤

≤

found in this paper, for any value of 1/ν , even with Neumann boundary onditions, have

the optimal number of poles n(ν).

Using however the Sivashinsky equation (Eq. 1) with Neumann boundary onditions, we

obtain in eah of the intervals [2n

1, 2n + 1] of the parameter 1/ν , not only one asymp-

totially stable solution, but several, of the form (l, n

l) with l = 0, 1,

, n where l poles

−

· · ·

oalese at x = 0 and l

n oalese at x = π (The bioalesent type of solutions have been

−

−

reently introdued in [8℄). These solutions will also be obtained from the non linear system

of equations (Eq. 4) in Setion III. It must be remarked that all these solutions, exept

the monooalesent one, are unstable for periodi boundary onditions, i.e. when antisym-

metri perturbations are allowed on [0, 2π]. We have just de(cid:28)ned here the notation (n1, n2)

that will be used in the paper for bioalesent solutions with n1 poles at zero, and n2 at π .

Monooalesent solutions an be seen as a partiular ase of bioalesent solutions and will

be noted (n, 0). We will enounter also multioalesent solutions, suh as (n1, n2, n3,

),

· · ·

whih means that in the interval [0, 2π], the poles oalese at di(cid:27)erent loations: n1 poles

oalese at a position on the left of the interval, generally 0, n2 poles oalese at a position

with a higher value of x, then n3 at a position with a value of x even higher, and so on. With

this notation (1,1,1) represents a ellular solution with three ells obtained by the folding of

the (1,0) solution.

For the partiular value 1/ν = 10.5 ((cid:28)ve poles) the di(cid:27)erent possible solutions are shown

on [0, π] in Figure 1. On the left, we have a monooalesent (5,0) solution with (cid:28)ve poles at

0. The middle solution of the (cid:28)gure is a (4,1) solution (4 poles at x = 0, 1 pole at x = π).

Finally the solution on the right is a (3,2) solution (3 poles at 0, 2 poles at π). For an even

value of the optimal number of poles (i.e. the value of n in the interval [2n

1, 2n + 1]),

−

the stable solutions will inlude a solution symmetri on [0, π], for instane if n = 6 we have

the solutions (6,0) (5,1) (4,2) and the symmetri (3,3) solution. In Figure 2 , we show on

the same (cid:28)gure the shape (x, φ(x)) (x is the horizontal diretion) of the (3,2) solution for

1/ν = 10.5 with x

[0, π] (lower part of the (cid:28)gure, below the horizontal segment) and the

∈

5

orresponding loations of poles in the omplex plane (upper part of the (cid:28)gure, above the

horizontal segment). The poles are indiated by irles, the segment is the real axis in pole

spae between 0 and 2π . The important thing about this type of (cid:28)gure, whih will be used

in the rest of the paper, is that a pole very lose to the real axis (i.e. very lose to the

horizontal segment in the upper part of the (cid:28)gure) leads to a usp in the front shape (in the

lower part of the (cid:28)gure), and that the x value of the pole in the omplex plane is the same

as the x value in physial spae of the usp that appears; in a diagram like Figure 2, the

usp and the orresponding pole are on the same vertial line . We will see later however

examples of poles far away from the real axis with no usp at the x value of the pole. This

e(cid:27)et results from a ompetition between a new pole and the poles at zero whih tend to

prevent the appearane of a new usp. It is desribed in a simple way in Appendix A.

An illustration of the stability of the (3,2) stationary solution is given in Figure 3. The

initial ondition used in the Sivashinsky equation, with Neumann boundary onditions, is

exatly the (3,2) solution for 1/ν = 10.5.

In a simulation without noise, the amplitude

(maximum minus minimum of φ(x)), would simply stay onstant with time, as the (3,2)

solution is stable. In order to ompliate the onvergene to the (3,2) solution, we apply a

noise (additive gaussian white noise added to the Sivashinsky equation, amplitude a = 0.01,

see setion IV for other examples of simulation with noise, and other explanations) when

time < 10, and then ontinue the simulation without noise up to a time of 500. The stability

of the (3,2) stationary solution for Neumann boundary onditions is illustrated by the fat

that the shape returns quikly to this solution (observe the fat that the (cid:28)nal amplitude is

exatly the same as the initial one).

Of the di(cid:27)erent stable stationary solutions just desribed, the largest basin of attration

(with initial onditions lose to a (cid:29)at (cid:29)ame with some random perturbations) orresponds

to the most symmetri solution (i.e. the (3,2) solution for 5 poles) and the monooalesent

solution ((5,0) in the previous ase). It even seems, if one ompares both types of solutions,

that the most symmetri solution has a larger basin of attration for low values of 1/ν (in

the ase of (cid:28)ve poles for instane), and the monooalesent one a larger basin for large 1/ν .

However, this result ould be limited to this type of initial onditions. Atually, in Setion

IV, it will be shown that in the presene of a moderate white noise added to the Sivashinsky

equation, the solution is muh more often lose to the most symmetri bioalesent solution

with the optimal number of poles than lose to the orresponding monooalesent solution.

6

Before losing this setion, let us note the analogy of the bioalesent solutions found

here with ellular solutions observed experimentally in diretional solidi(cid:28)ation [9℄. These

solutions, alled doublets, look almost the same as the bioalesent solutions of this setion.

They are also stable for some range of parameters. However, a ma jor di(cid:27)erene is that

there is no instability at large sale in diretional solidi(cid:28)ation, and that as a result, the

struture with one small usp, one large usp an be repeated a number of times in the

overall doublet ellular struture. But in both ases, (cid:29)ames (bioalesent solutions) and

diretional solidi(cid:28)ation (doublets), these type of stationary solutions are related to the

well-known phenomenon of tip-splitting of urved fronts [10℄.

III. WEB OF STATIONARY SOLUTIONS

As most of the solutions of the previous setion were not found by Guidi and Marhetti,

only some trivial, ellular solutions obtained by folding, suh as the (2,2) solution, we in-

vestigate in this setion higher values of 1/ν than those used in their paper [8℄. As in this

paper, we plot the stationary solutions in a diagram giving the amplitude (maximum minus

minimum value of the solution) versus 1/ν .

A light version of this diagram, with only the most important solutions, partiularly the

bioalesent solutions of the previous setion, is shown in Figure 4. The omplete version

of this diagram, with all the solutions obtained by the author, will be shown in Figure 5.

We have found it neessary to use two (cid:28)gures, beause the di(cid:27)erent solutions are so lose

in Figure 5 that it is di(cid:30)ult at (cid:28)rst sight to reognize a partiular bioalesent solution

in this (cid:28)gure. We hope that a omparison between Figures 4 and 5 an help the reader

understand how the bioalesent solutions of the previous setion are interonneted to the

rest of the stationary solutions, partiularly the ellular ones. But the author knows, it is

not an easy task for the reader, so for the moment, we only start with the simpli(cid:28)ed version

of the diagram. To be more preise, we plot in Figure 4 the basi solutions, i.e. the solutions

with n poles whose branh exists in the interval [2n

1, 2n + 1] of the parameter 1/ν . In

−

this interval, these type of solutions have thus the optimal number of poles, a neessary

ondition for the solution to be stable, as explained in Setion II.

In dashed lines in Figure 4 an be seen the monooalesent solutions (n, 0) whih are

reated at 1/ν = 2n

1 and are stable in the periodi ase until the next solution (n + 1, 0)

−

7

is reated. From these solutions, by a proess we all here folding and whih is de(cid:28)ned

in the previous setion, the solutions (1,1) (1,1,1) ... (dotted lines) are reated, as well as

the bioalesent (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) ... The non trivial bioalesent solutions of Setion II are

reated starting from these symmetri bioalesent solutions. The hierarhy (2,1) (3,1) (4,1)

(5,1)... is reated starting from the (1,1) solution obtained by folding. The hierarhy (3,2)

(4,2) ... emerges from the (2,2) solution. Finally, In Figure 4 the solution (4,3) ((cid:28)rst element

of the hierarhy (5,3) (6,3) ...) is reated from the (3,3) solution, whih means that one pole

omes from in(cid:28)nity at a given value of 1/ν to reate the solution.

All the solutions of the previous hierarhies are plotted as solid blak lines in Figure 4.

With the exeption of the folded symmetri solutions, all the other bioalesent solutions

of this (cid:28)gure are stable when they are reated, until a new solution with one more pole

appears. This behavior is exatly similar to the monooalesent solutions, the intervals of

stability are also the same.

In solid gray lines in Figure 4 are plotted however another hierarhy of solutions. This

hierarhy ontains solutions of the type (2,1,1) (3,1,1) (4,1,1) apparently reated exatly

on the same intervals as before. Of ourse this hierarhy only leads to unstable solutions,

in the periodi as well as the Neumann ase. It seems reasonable to suggest that as 1/ν

inreases, an in(cid:28)nite number of hierarhies will be reated, eah starting from a suitable

folded solution. The author atually suggests the following onjeture: for eah value 1/ν of

the ontrol parameter with optimal number of poles n(ν), all the multioalesent stationary

solutions having the optimal number of poles, labelled (n1, ..., np) for any p in the interval

1

p

n(ν), with

p
i=1 ni = n(ν), do exist.

≤

≤
Furthermore, as the amplitude of the solutions in these hierarhies inreases with 1/ν , it is

P

extremely likely that solutions of the (n, 1) hierarhy for instane, will soon beome extremely

lose to the orresponding monooalesent solution (n + 1, 0). And in the Neumann ase, all

the bioalesent hierarhies lead to stable stationary solutions. A study of the time evolution

of solutions of the Sivashinsky equation will be reported in Setion IV.

The previous argument suggests that there are many stationary solutions of the Sivashin-

sky equation. However, as seen in Figure 5, Figure 4 was a very simpli(cid:28)ed version of the

diagram, with only the most important stationary solutions, whih were alled basi solu-

tions (see the explanation above), and form a sort of skeleton of the entire struture of the

solutions. We have alled this struture web of stationary solutions for obvious reasons, all

8

the solutions are interonneted, even the number of jumps neessary to go from one solu-

tion to one another an probably be de(cid:28)ned, reminisent of the hops from router to router

on the internet. It is to be noted that the other well-known Sivashinsky-type equation, the

Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, also admits a huge number of stationary solutions [11℄. The

author does not even laim to have obtained in Figure 5 something omprehensive in the

parameter spae studied. The reader is again warned that it is easier to look at both (cid:28)gures

4 and 5 at the same time, to loate (cid:28)rst the basi solutions that a partiular interpolating

solution onnets.

The new solutions ompared to Figure 4 are of the interpolating type disussed by Guidi

and Marhetti. We de(cid:28)ne here these interpolating solutions (as opposed to basi solutions)

as solutions whose branh does not exist in the interval [2n

1, 2n + 1] of the parameter

−

1/ν . Thus these solutions do not have the optimal number of poles and annot be stable

(starting from suh a solution, a pole would ome from in(cid:28)nity or disappear at in(cid:28)nity and

a solution with the optimal number of poles would be reated). But in Figure 5, it an

be seen that these interpolating solutions typially onnet di(cid:27)erent basi solutions of the

previous bifuration diagram (Figure 4).

For instane, if one starts from the ellular solutions (1,1,1,...), there exists interpolating

solutions starting from this solution and leading to all ellular solutions and the mono-

oalesent solutions above.

It must be noted that the preise values of 1/ν , where these

interpolating branhes appear from the ellular solutions, were alulated analytially in

[12℄. In the simple ase of the (1,1,1) solution already studied by Guidi and Marhetti, it is

possible to move the poles vertially in the omplex plane in two di(cid:27)erent ways in order to

have an initial guess of the position of the poles on the interpolating branhes (the Newton

iteration leading to the true values of the positions of the poles). Eah interpolating solution

emanating from a ellular solution an be labelled by the way the poles move along the in-

terpolating branh ompared to the ellular solution. This type of pole movement along the

interpolating branh (at the beginning, where the branh is reated) orresponds exatly to

the way the poles of the ellular solutions must be moved in order to obtain an initial guess

that will onverge. So we have the (+,-,+) solution: two poles are moved upward in the

omplex plane (i.e. their imaginary part inreases, while the real part is kept onstant), one

downward ompared to the (1,1,1) solution. This (+,-,+) solution will interpolate, starting

from the three ells solution, all the monooalesent solutions (1,0) (2,0) and (3,0) (this part

9

of the diagram will be desribed in more details later). We have also the (-,+,-) solution,

whih, as seen in the (cid:28)gure, interpolates the (1,1) solution (one pole going at in(cid:28)nity at this

point).

If we look at a muh more ompliated ase, the (cid:28)ve poles (1,1,1,1,1) solution, it seems

that in order to get the interpolating solutions, we have to onsider at least three levels of

vertial movement of the imaginary part of the poles, and for instane one interpolating so-

lution has been onstruted by moving the third pole upward, the (cid:28)rst and (cid:28)fth downward,

the seond and fourth somewhere in between. Unfortunately, as shown in the ase of the

interpolating solutions emanating from the six poles ellular (1,1,1,1,1,1) solution, the au-

thor's apaities have been exeeded and neither the solution interpolating (1,0) (2,0) (3,0)

(4,0) (5,0) (6,0), neither the one interpolating (1,1,1,1) have been found. Atually, although

it is more or less obvious that these solutions exist, the present author has been unable to

generate initial pole loations onverging to these solutions (whih probably means that the

author has not understood what type of perturbation of the ellular solution leads to these

two branhes).

If the way the monooalesent solutions are interpolated starting from the ellular so-

lutions is now onsidered, we prefer to start now from the monooalesent solution, for

instane the (6,0) solution, and derease 1/ν .

In Figure 4, the monooalesent solutions

were appearing suddenly apparently from nothing, for some value of the ontrol parameter.

On the ontrary, in Figure 5, preursors of the monooalesent solution exist. So if the (6,0)

solution appears at 1/ν = 11, what do we have exatly before ?

Atually, between 1/ν = 11 and 1/ν = 10, the preursor of (6,0) is a bioalesent (5,1)

solution, with (cid:28)ves poles at zero, one at π , however, the last one is very far from the real axis,

and does not lead to a usp in the solution. This type of bioalesent solution, apart from the

folded solutions like (2,2), were the only ones obtained in Guidi and Marhetti (they have

obtained atually the (3,1) solution interpolating (4,0) and the (2,1) interpolating (3,0)).

They are unstable even for Neumann boundary onditions, beause they do not have the

optimal number of poles orresponding to the ontrol parameter (the optimal number was

de(cid:28)ned in Setion II).

Between 1/ν = 10 and 1/ν = 9, the solution is no more bioalesent, but is instead a

(4,1,1) solution. Then on [8, 9] we have a (3,1,1,1) solution, on [7, 8] a (2,1,1,1,1) solution,

and as said before, we have not obtained the preursor lose to the six poles ellular solution.

10

It is also possible to explain the previous laim that the preursors of (6,0) interpolate all

the monooalesent solutions with a number of poles less than 6. At 1/ν = 11, one of the

six poles at zero goes to in(cid:28)nity, and reappears at π to give a (5,1) solution. At 1/ν = 10

, the pole at π and one of the poles at zero go to in(cid:28)nity, and reappear later to give a

(4,1,1) solution, and so on. The fasinating point is that although all the preursors appear

di(cid:27)erent, the urve of the amplitude of all the preursors and of the (cid:28)nal monooalesent

solution versus the ontrol parameter looks perfely smooth. This, as well as the overall

struture of Figure 5, suggests that symmetries less obvious than those leading to the folded

solutions ould be at work in the Sivashinsky equation.

Let us look now at the shape of all these preursors in physial spae. We onsider

as before the ase ν = 10.5 (optimal number of poles : 5) . We show in Figure 6 di(cid:27)erent

urved (cid:29)ame solutions. The one with the higher amplitude is the stable monooalesent (5,0)

solution. Then we have, with smaller amplitude, a six poles (5,1) solution interpolating (6,0).

Then we have the four poles (4,0) solution, a seven poles (4,1,1,1) solution interpolating (7,0),

the three poles (3,0) solution, and an eight poles (3,1,1,1,1,1) interpolating (8,0). We have

stopped there, as the next solutions in this list have an amplitude very di(cid:27)erent from the

original (5,0). The interesting point is that in Figure 6, all these solutions, whih have a

very di(cid:27)erent number of poles, look relatively similar, like subsided versions the original

monooalesent solution, the (cid:28)rst ones being very lose to (5,0) (and will be even loser

with inreasing 1/ν ). It seems that this is the way the Sivashinsky equation is reovering a

ontinuum of urved (cid:29)ame solutions in the limit 1/ν

→ ∞, something like the ontinuum of

Ivantsov parabola of the related solidi(cid:28)ation problem [10℄. From the simulations of Setion

IV, it is not obvious at all that these subsided unstable stationary solutions lose to the

monooalesent play any partiular role in the dynamis, exept perhaps by providing ways

to esape the stable monooalesent solution during the transient phase. We have shown in

the suessive Figures 7, 8 and 9 the solutions and their poles for the non trivial ases (5,1),

(4,1,1,1) and (3,1,1,1,1,1) respetively. One again, it highlights the fat that the presene

of poles is not equivalent to the presene of usps, su(cid:30)iently far from the real axis, and

with other poles muh loser, some poles only lead to solutions with a weaker amplitude

(see Appendix A).

Now, if we take another look at the stable bioalesent solutions of Setion II, the same

phenomenon as for monooalesent solutions has to be observed: the bioalesent solutions

11

do not appear from nothing at a preise value of the parameters, they have preursors, as

seen in Figure 5. For instane, we have produed preursors of the (n, 1) hierarhy, whih

also look like subsided versions of the orresponding stable bioalesent solutions, and will

also be loser to the original solution as 1/ν inreases.

Overall, the bifuration diagram going from ellular to urved (cid:29)ame fronts with all the

interpolating solutions of Figure 5 has a struture totally unexpeted. In the Sivashinsky

equation ase, most of the ellular solutions are unstable. However, the addition of a suf-

(cid:28)ient amount of gravity ((cid:29)ames propagating downward) to the Sivashinsky equation is

known to stabilize these solutions and to reate a omplex transition from ellular to urved

fronts when gravity is varied [13℄[14℄. It remains to be seen if the struture of this transition

has any relation with Figure 5, whih is likely, as a stable stationary solution lose to the

bioalesent solutions of the present paper was found in [14℄. But searhing for stationary

solution with gravity is muh more di(cid:30)ult than with the Sivashinsky equation, as no pole

deomposition exists. The author takes this opportunity to say that the instabilities of

urved (cid:29)ames observed with a very small gravity (and with periodi boundary onditions)

in [15℄ would probably disappear with Neumann boundary onditions, as the most violent

instabilities of this paper are reated by antisymmetri modes.

IV. EVOLUTION WITH NOISE

In Figure 10, we start by showing a typial time evolution with periodi boundary on-

ditions, and a white noise added to the right hand side of the Sivashinsky equation. This

white noise is gaussian, with zero mean value and deviation one, and we multiply it by an

amplitude a . a = 0.01 and 1/ν = 11.5 (optimal number of poles: six) in the simulations

presented in this setion, with periodi and Neumann boundary onditions. In Figure 10 is

plotted, for periodi boundary onditions, the amplitude of the front versus time, the initial

ondition being a (cid:28)ve poles solution whih is not stationary for this value of the ontrol

parameter, and leads to the initial transient.

After this transient, the solution osillates violently between low and high values of the

amplitude. The peak values orrespond to urved front solutions, with the poles being

apparently almost monooalesent, but with an amplitude muh higher than the monooa-

lesent (6,0) stationary solution. The values of the amplitudes for the stationary solutions

12

(6,0) (5,1) (4,2) (3,3) are all indiated in the (cid:28)gure by gray lines, so that the reader an

ompare. The low values orrespond to shapes with a new usp formed in the (cid:29)at part of the

front. For the lowest values of the amplitude, this new usp leads almost to a bioalesent

solution, but with again an amplitude whih seems higher than the (5,1) or (4,2) stationary

solution. The solution never omes lose to the (3,3) solution, whih on [0, 2π] is a two ells

solution. Furthermore, other low values of the amplitude orrespond to a usp that develops

without being exatly entered. Anyway, the dynamis is dominated in the periodi ase by

antisymmetri perturbations. Even if the new usp formed by the perturbation is orretly

entered when it forms, it will ultimately move on one side, and will be swallowed by the

main usp. This of ourse modi(cid:28)es the position of the main usp, and leads to the very

high peak amplitudes observed. This antisymmetri dynamis is forbidden for Neumann

boundary onditions, so let us see now what happens in this ase.

The situation is shown in Figure 11, for the same ontrol parameter and noise amplitude

as in the periodi ase. Before disussing this (cid:28)gure in detail, the overall impression is that

the signal obtained is muh less turbulent. The di(cid:27)erent stationary solutions for this value

of the ontrol parameter are also indiated by gray lines.

The (cid:28)rst point to note is that in this (cid:28)gure, exept in the initial transient, the front is

never monooalesent. Even for the peak values obtained, where the amplitudes obtained

sometimes seem lose to the (6,0) amplitude, we stress that all the solutions obtained at the

peak value are bioalesent and not monooalesent. On the ontrary, the solution seems

often lose to the di(cid:27)erent bioalesent (3,3) (4,2) and (5,1) solutions. We show in Figure

12 a omparison between the solution at time 410.555 in Figure 11 (dashed dotted line),

where the amplitude has a loal minimum very lose to the amplitude of the (4,2) solution,

and the shape of the (4,2) solution for 1/ν = 11.5 (solid line). The agreement between both

solutions is exellent in this ase. For very small values of the noise amplitude (not shown

here) the solution (with Neumann boundary onditions) atually osillates around the (3,3)

solution, without making jumps to any of the other stable stationary solutions. As the noise

used here is gaussian, it is not impossible however, that jumps ould our as extremely rare

events (for very small noise amplitudes), and ould be observed in very long simulations.

The value of the noise taken here a = 0.01, although moderate, is already su(cid:30)ient

to produe jumps in the amplitude, often atually jumps between the bioalesent steady

solutions. The very low values of the amplitude in Figure 11 orrespond to shapes with three

13

usps in [0, π], one on eah boundary, and one in the middle. For this value of the ontrol

parameter, the middle usp is always smaller than the usps on the side. It is the author's

opinion that the lowest values of the amplitude orrespond to a shape lose to an unstable

stationary solution, whih has not been found in Figure 5. As the solution does not need to

be symmetri on [0, π], the mehanism for the disappearane of the middle usp is relatively

similar to the same one on [0, 2π] in the periodi ase, the middle usp moves on one side

and is swallowed by one of the two main usps. The di(cid:27)erene here with the periodi ase

is that the main usp does not move after having swallowed the small usp and stays on the

boundary.

After the low values of the amplitude omes a transient, where the amplitude very quikly

grows towards a peak value, whih is a very unstationary bioalesent solution. Depending

on the noise, the shape will then often ome bak lose to a stationary bioalesent solution.

Finally, it seems that higher noise amplitudes or larger 1/ν (the type of signal obtained is

very sensitive to this last value) lead to more turbulent urves of amplitude versus time with

more jumps and more time spent in the unstable low amplitudes solutions and the very

unstationary peaks.

To onlude this setion, let us ompare the behavior with Neumann and periodi bound-

ary onditions. For small ν , the stable stationary solutions are very sensitive to external

noise in both ases. As is well-known in the periodi ase (and in this respet, the situation

is very similar with Neumann boundary onditions) , small perturbations are ontinuously

reated on the front. But the di(cid:27)erene lies in the symmetries. In the periodi ase, the sta-

ble stationary solutions are the monooalesent solution with the optimal number of poles,

and the ontinuum of its lateral translations, all neutrally stable beause of this symmetry.

The noise keeps disturbing the monooalesent solution, but another solution of the ontin-

uum of monooalesent solutions (with the optimal number of poles) is also ontinuously

rereated. With Neumann boundary onditions, the stable solutions are now the bioales-

ent solutions with the optimal number of poles. The perturbations reated by the noise

now serve to explore the di(cid:27)erent stable bioalesent solutions, ausing jumps between two

di(cid:27)erent bioalesent solutions. But with Neumann boundary onditions, all stable solutions

are not reated equal, some are easier to destabilize than the others. As seen previously

for instane, the monooalesent solution is more sensitive to noise. As a result, during the

time evolution, the front will almost never be lose to the monooalesent solution for small

14

ν (whih is just the opposite of the behavior with periodi boundary onditions).

V. CONCLUSION

To summarize this paper, new bioalesent solutions of the Sivashinsky equation, stable

in the Neumann ase, have been obtained. They have found their loation in the inredible

struture of the web of stationary solutions. Simulations for moderate noise show that the

evolution is ontrolled by jumps between stationary solutions. The author would like to

insist here on the most important point of this paper: evolution with periodi (ontrolled

by antisymmetri perturbations) and Neumann boundary onditions is very di(cid:27)erent. The

Neumann boundary onditions are more realisti, although in the presene of heat losses,

the (cid:29)ame is no more perpendiular to the wall (and is of ourse three dimensional). Finally,

it is likely that new analytial studies of the Sivashinsky equation should be possible: even

if the equation is now almost thirty years old, many things remain to be explained.

Appendix A: HOW FAR MUST A POLE BE LOCATED FROM THE REAL AXIS

TO CREATE A NEW CUSP?

In this appendix, we will try to explain in a very simpli(cid:28)ed way that adding a new pole

to a monooalesent solution does not neessarily reate a new usp if the isolated pole is

loated too far from the real axis. Let us onsider the following idealized situation: we have

a monooalesent stationary solution with poles loated at 0. A new pole at π is added to

this solution, without moving any of the other poles oalesed at 0. The front with the new

pole is no more stationary, but in this appendix, we try to answer the following question: at

whih distane of the new pole to the real axis is a new usp reated ? We all this distane

yc and its value will be measured numerially for di(cid:27)erent values of 1/ν , with an optimal

number of poles. In real situations the presene of the pole at π modi(cid:28)es the position of the

poles at 0, partiularly the poles loated far from the real axis. We neglet this e(cid:27)et as we

just want to have a reasonable order of magnitude of the value of yc leading to a new usp.

It turns out that the value of yc an be omputed analytially in the ontinuous ap-

proximation introdued by Thual Frish and Hénon [3℄. Instead of summing on every pole

loated at 0, this disrete sum is replaed by an integral, with a pole density ρ(y) (y being

15

the vertial oordinate in the omplex plane) given by (see [3℄ for a derivation):

The value of the slope of the front φxorresponding to the oalesed poles at 0 (in the

hoose the natural ondition φxx (x = π) < 0. The value of φxx at this point is reated by

the ompetition between the oalesed poles at 0, whih tend to prevent the reation of the

new usp, and the isolated pole (and its omplex onjugate) whih has the opposite e(cid:27)et.

With the previous forms of the slope and the pole density, we obtain:

In this formula, the term 1/π omes from the poles at 0, the other term from the isolated

pole at π. As said before, these two terms have di(cid:27)erent signs. The ondition φxx (x = π) = 0

(cid:28)nally leads to the value of y1 = yc orresponding to the appearane of a usp, whih is:

yc = 2 arcsinh

√πν

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

The usp only appears if y1 < yc . We now ompare in Figure 13 this formula to the

values of yc measured numerially for 1/ν =10 (5 poles at 0, one at π) , 20 (10+1 poles),

40, 60, 80, 100 (50+1 poles), eah time with the optimal number of poles oalesed at 0

and one extra pole at π . The solid urve is the previous formula obtained in the ontinuous

approximation, the irles are the values measured numerially.

It an be seen that the

16

agreement is good. It is even more surprising if we think that for 1/ν = 10 we have only

(cid:28)ve poles at 0 and the ontinuous approximation for the seond order derivative at π works

orretly, the numerial point is just slightly below the theoretial urve. Of ourse, this

result is obtained in the framework of an illustrative model where all the positions of the

poles are kept (cid:28)xed, but it serves to justify the fat that in the presene of other poles, a

new pole at a di(cid:27)erent x oordinate needs to be su(cid:30)iently lose to the real axis to reate

a new usp.

on this solution when time < 10, and is then suddenly stopped. The solution goes bak to the (3,2)

solution for large times.

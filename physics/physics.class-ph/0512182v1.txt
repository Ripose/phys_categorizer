Abstract

In this paper an analysis of the Stirling cycle in thermoeconomic terms is developed using the

entropy generation.

In the thermoeconomic optimization of an irreversible Stirling heat pump

cycle the F function has been introduced to evaluate the optimum for the higher and lower sources

temperature ratio in the cycle: this ratio represents the value which optimizes the cycle itself. The

variation of the function F is proportional to the variation of the entropy generation, the maxima

and minima of F has been evaluated in a previous paper without giving the physical foundation

of the method. We investigate the groundwork of this approach: to study the upper and lower

limits of F function allows to determine the cycle stability and the optimization conditions. The

optimization consists in the best COP at the least cost. The principle of maximum variation

for the entropy generation becomes the analytic foundation of the optimization method in the

thermoeconomic analysis for an irreversible Stirling heat pump cycle.

INTRODUCTION

The Stirling cycle is an important model of refrigeration systems and the recent develop-

ments in design were proposed after the new concept of ﬁnite time thermodynamics came

into existence [1, 2, 3]. Blanchard applied the Lagrange multiplier method to ﬁnd out the

COP of an endoreversible Carnot heat pump operating at the minimum power input for a

given heating load [4]. Several papers heve been devoted to propose mathematical functions

to optimize thermodynamics cycles starting from diﬀerent initial conditions and focusing

on the total cost and eﬃciency. The deﬁnition of optimization that we adopt in this pa-

per is the best COP at the least cost. The performance of the diﬀerent heat engine and

refrigeration systems were investigated using the concept of ﬁnite time thermodynamics,

of the ecological approach and the thermoeconomic analysis [1, 5, 6, 7, 8]. On the other

hand, the key-role of entropy generation maximum has been recently demonstrated in ther-

modynamics analysis of the irreversible processes and it has been shown that it represents

a new criterion for determining the conditions for stability [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. In this

paper we show that this criterion represents the thermodynamic foundation for some recent

results obtained in thermoeconomic analysis of the Stirling heat pump cycle. We start from

studying the time evolution of an open system and we take as working hypothesis that it

evolves in the optimization of the irreversibilitiy due to entropy generation. F function is well

suited to show the system evolution related to the irreversibility due to entropy generation,

our aim is to propose an approach based upon the natural behaviour of the thermodynam-

ics/thermoeconomic system as a groundwork for the optimization analysis. The evolution

of an open system is considered natural when it moves in order to get the optimization of

the entropy generation.

II. THE THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSIS

The working substance of the Stirling cycle may be a gas, a magnetic material, etc., and

for diﬀerent working ﬂuids the performance of the cycle are quite diﬀerent. The Stirling cycle

with an ideal gas consists of two isothermal and two isochoric processes. It approximates

the expansion stroke of the real cycle by an isothermal process to whom heat is added to

reach the temperature Tc from a heat source of ﬁnite capacity whose temperature varies

2

from TL1 to TL2. The heat addition to the working ﬂuid is thought as an isochoric process:

heat is going towards the heat sink of ﬁnite heat capacity that gets a temperature variation

from TH1 to TH2. The heat rejection from the working ﬂuid to the regenerator is modelled

as an isochoric process which completes the cycle itself. Let Qc and Qh be the amount of

heat absorbed from the sources at the temperature Tc and Th respectively, during the two

isothermal processes [1]:

Qh = CHǫH (Th − TH1)th

Qc = CLǫL(TL1 − Tc)tL

(1)

(2)

where CH is the heat capacitance rate of the sink reservoir, CL is the heat capacitance

rate of the source reservoir, tH is the heat rejection time, tL is the heat addition time,

ǫH is the eﬀectiveness of the heat exchangers for the hot-side and ǫL is the eﬀectiveness

of the heat exchangers for the cold-side. These cycles do not possess the condition of

perfect regeneration, hence it is assumed that the loss per cycle, ∆QR, is proportional to

the temperature diﬀerence of the two isothermal processes as follows [1, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]:

∆QR = ncf (1 − ǫR)(Th − Tc)

(3)

where cf is the molar heat capacity of the working ﬂuid and n is the number of moles. The

Gouy-Stodola theorem [20] states that the thermodynamic work burnt in the irreversibility

due to the entropy generation is equal to the product between the lowest source temperature

and the entropy generation, i.e. total entropy is equal to the isolated system entropy plus

the irreversibility due to entropy generation. Considering the Gouy-Stodola theorem and

the deﬁnition of the entropy due to irreversibility ∆Sirr [13], the last one can be written as:

∆Sirr =

= ncf (1 − ǫR)

= ncf (1 − ǫR)(x − 1)

(4)

∆QR
Tc

(Th − Tc)
Tc

with x = Th/Tc. The theorem of maximum entropy generation states that the entropy

generation is maximum at stationary state [9]. This theorem allows a new approach to

irreversible processes as it is proved in a lot of diﬀerent applications in hydrodynamics [10],

engineering thermodynamics [11], rational thermodynamics [12] and biophysics [13, 14].

Hence applying it here, we argue that equation 4 must be a maximum in the thermodynamics

stability: this equation described the natural behavior of the thermodynamics system.

costs, and are deﬁned as:

(9)

Ci = a(AH + AL + AR) + b

Qh − Qc
tcycle

Ce = b

Qh − Qc
tcycle

where a is a constant directly proportional to the investment cost of the heat exchanger

and is equal to the capital recovery factor multiplied by the investment cost per unit heat

exchanger area. AH +AL+AR is the heat exchanger total area, with AH the heating area, AL

the heat source area and AR the regenerative area. b is the capital recovery factor multiplied

by the investment cost per unit power input and tcycle is deﬁned as:

with

tcycle = tH + tL + tR

tR = 2α(Th − Tc) = 2αTc(x − 1)

where α is a constant that depends upon the kind of working ﬂuid used in the cycle,

and shows that the working time of the regenerator (a sort of recovering time towards the

initial conditions in thermoeconomics) is proportional to the diﬀerence of temperature. In

the thermoeconomic analysis of an irreversible Stirling heat pump cycle the function F has

been used to evaluate the ratio of the higher and lower source temperature in order to reach

the optimization of the cycle itself. The common solution, based upon the application of

the variation method, consists in evaluating the maxima of F function, solving the equation

δF = 0 [1] applying the variational method.

Now, from 6 and 7 the 5 becomes:

F =

a(AH + AL + AR) + (b + b′)

Qh − Qc

Starting from the relations 4, 5, 8-10, we can argue that the objective function F of the

thermoeconomic optimization is related to the entropy generation as follows:

F =

a(AH + AL + AR) + (b + b′)

which can be easily written after few algebric operations:

F = =

Γ2 = 2αTc ˙QH

Γ3 = a(AH + AL + AR)(tH + tL) + (b − b′)(Qh − Qc)

Γ4 = 2αa(AH +AL+AR)Tc

ncf (1−ǫR

From equation 12 we can argue that the variation of the function F is proportional to

the variation of the entropy generation:

with

Then it follows that

δF =

Γ2Γ3 − Γ1Γ4
Γ3 + Γ4∆Sirr

δ(∆Sirr)

Γ2Γ3 6= Γ1Γ4

δ(∆Sirr) = 0 ⇒ δF = 0

In this way it has been stressed the relation between the economic analysis and the

thermodynamics. In the economical analysis the function F was introduced in several papers:

we need to know its upper and lower limits to fulﬁll the basic conditions of optimization, but

no physical explanation has been up to now given about this method. Here we prove that

the limits of the F function are directly correlated to the entropy generation in the state

of stability and related to the optimization of the cycle. Hence the optimization, which

consists in the best COP related to the least cost, can be obtained in the conditions of

natural stability for the open systems. The evolution of an open system is deﬁned natural

when it moves to get the optimization of entropy. The advantages of this method consist

in exploiting the natural dynamics of the system in order to reach, following its natural

behaviour, the optimum by the shortest way (i.e. the lower cost).

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The thermodynamic and thermoeconomic analysis of the optimization of an irreversible

Stirling heat pump cycle is presented in relation with its thermodynamic foundation. We

proved that the principle of maximum variation for the irreversible entropy is the analytic

foundation for the optimization method recently introduced in the thermoeconomic analysis

for an irreversible Stirling heat pump cycle. Of course it represents not only an analytical

and mathematical groundwork, but also the physical and thermodynamic foundation for

the method itself, as a consequence of the physical meaning of the principle of maximum

entropy variation in thermodynamics [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. The optimization method is a

useful tool to design thermodynamics systems characterized by lower working costs. The

principle of maximum variation allows a deeper thermoeconomic analysis focused on the

stability conditions.

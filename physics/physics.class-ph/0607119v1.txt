The relaxation method used to solve boundary value problems is applied to study the variation of
the magnetization orientation in several types of domain walls that occur in ferromagnetic materials.
The algorithm is explained and applied to several cases: the Bloch wall in bulk magnetic systems,
the radial wall in cylindrical wires and the N´eel wall in thin ﬁlms.

INTRODUCTION

p

A domain is a region in a ferromagnetic material with the magnetization along a given direction. A magnetic
material contains many domains with diﬀerent magnetizations pointing in diﬀerent directions in order to minimize
the total magnetostatic energy. Regions with diﬀerent orientations of their magnetization can be close to one another
albeit with a boundary called a domain wall (containing typically about 102 – 103 atoms).
Saturation occurs when all these regions align along some common direction imposed an external applied ﬁeld, the
total magnetization reaching its largest value Ms.
The width of a domain wall is equal to π
A/K where A is the typical nearest neighbor Heisenberg exchange
interaction and K the typical anisotropy constant (see Table I). Hence, a magnetic wall results from exchange and
anisotropy, being thinner for higher anisotropy or smaller exchange (In Fe it is about 30 nanometers whereas in a
hard material like Nd2Fe14B it is about 5 nanometers, only). Domain wall energy is given by 4√AK illustrating once
again the competing role of exchange and anisotropy.
For bulk materials, walls of the Bloch type occur whereas in thin ﬁlms N´eel type walls are encountered when the
ﬁlm thickness is close to the exchange length (deﬁned by ℓex =
A/K, which is a few nanometers for ferromagnetic
materials like Ni, Fe or Co, see Table I). In the case of soft or amorphous materials characterised by a vanishing
anisotropy constant K, one uses rather the magnetostatic exchange length deﬁned by ℓex =
s . In all cases,
the wall width δ is obtained from the exchange length via δ = πℓex.
A single parameter Q = 2K/M 2
s allows to discriminate between simple (Q < 1) and complex wall proﬁles (Q > 1)
(see Malozemoﬀ and Slonczewski [2]). For example, in ﬁg. 1 a Bloch wall, belonging to the class (Q < 1) is depicted
with the magnetization rotating in a vertical plane.
Mathematically, a domain wall appears as a result of a non-linear two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP)
since it separates two distinct regions with a well deﬁned value of the magnetization. The TPBVP originates from a
minimization of the total magnetic energy that contains in general a competition between the anisotropy and exchange
energies.
In this work, a general numerical approach based on the relaxation method is applied to the study of domain proﬁles
in several geometries: bulk, wires and thin ﬁlms.
This report is organised as follows: In section 2, the numerical relaxation method is described; in section 3 we discuss
Bloch walls, whereas radial walls in cylindrical wires are described in section 4. In section 5 N´eel walls are described
and ﬁnally section 6 contains a discussion and a conclusion.

II. THE RELAXATION METHOD

Traditionally, TPBVP are typically tackled with the shooting method. The shooting method typically progresses
from one boundary point to another using, for instance, Runga-Kutta integration [4] with a set of initial conditions
attempting at reaching the end boundary.
For regular Ordinary Diﬀerential Equations (ODE), simple shooting is enough to reach the solution.
In more
complicated ODE, one has to rely on double shooting also called shooting to a ﬁtting point. The algorithm consists
of shooting from both boundaries to a middle point (ﬁtting point) where continuity of the solution and derivative are
required. In certain cases, one even has to perform multiple shooting in order to converge toward the solution [3].
In the case of presence of singularities (within the domain or at the boundaries) the shooting method in all

its versions:
simple, double or multiple does not usually converge. We ﬁnd that it is the case also with do-
main walls because of a rapid drop of the solution somewhere in the integration interval (due to the rapid
change of the magnetization orientation in the wall). In this work, we develop, a new method to tackle the domain
wall problem based on the relaxation method and ﬁnd it quite suitable to handle relatively fast changes in the solution.

The basic idea of the relaxation method is to convert the diﬀerential equation into a ﬁnite diﬀerence equation
(FDE). When the problem involves a system of N coupled ﬁrst-order ODE’s represented by FDE’s on a mesh of M
points, a solution consists of values for N dependent functions given at each of the M mesh points, that is N
M
variables in all. The relaxation method determines the solution by starting with a guess and improving it, iteratively.
The iteration scheme is very eﬃcient since it is based on the multidimensional Newton’s method (see Numerical
recipes [4]). The matrix equation that must be solved, takes a special, block diagonal form, that can be inverted far
(M N ). The
more economically both in time and storage than would be possible for a general matrix of size (M N )
solution is based on error functions for the boundary conditions and the interior points.
Given a set of N ﬁrst-order ODE’s depending on a single spatial variable x:

The FDE Ek provide N equations coupling 2N variables at the mesh points of indices k
a total of M (N
[4]:
At the ﬁrst boundary x1 we have: 0 = E1 = B(x1, y1)
At the second boundary x2, we have: 0 = EM+1 = C(xM , yM )
The vectors E1 and B have n1 non-zero components corresponding to the n1 boundary conditions at x1. The vectors
EM+1 and C have n2 non-zero components corresponding to the n2 boundary conditions at x2, with n1 + n2 = N
the total number of ODE’s.

The main idea of the relaxation method is to begin with initial guesses of yj and relax them to the approximately
true values by calculating the errors Ei to correct the value of yj iteratively. Relaxation might be viewed as a rotation
of the initial vector (representing the solution) under the constraints deﬁned by Ei. The evolution of the relaxation
process, is obtained from solution-improving increments ∆yk that can be evaluated from a ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion
of the error functions Ek.
It is that expansion that results in the matrix equation possessing a special block diagonal form, allowing inversion
economically in terms of time and storage (see ref. [4]).

The energy of an uniaxial ferromagnetic material comprises anisotropy and exchange terms. An inﬁnite volume is

considered to exclude any shape related demagnetization energy. Exchange energy density is given by [1]:

where Einstein summation convention is used for repeated indices i, k, l = 1...3. The uniaxial anisotropy en-
ergy is given by KijMiMj with i, j = 1...3. For simplicity, we assume a single uniform exchange constant A
(see Table I) and a sole dependence on the x coordinate of all components of the magnetization M . We have
M = (0, Ms sin θ(x), Ms cos θ(x)) (see ﬁg. 1). θ(x), the angle the magnetization makes with the z axis considered as
the anisotropy axis. The sought proﬁle is the function θ(x). Ms is the saturation magnetization when all individual
magnetic moments in the material are aligned along the same direction.

The energy minimum is found by nulling the variational derivative of E with respect to θ. We ﬁnd:

where y1 = θ(x) satisﬁes the boundary conditions:

y1(x) = π;

lim

y1(x) = 0

It is understood that the sharp transition between the θ = 0 phase and the θ = π is behind the failure of all shooting

methods.

Using the relaxation method, we easily obtain the wall proﬁles for any value of ξ as displayed in ﬁg. 2.
Actually, the Bloch wall problem is single scale and we can without performing the calculation for every ξ value, do
it for one value and then change the scale accordingly. This is done as follows: The width of the domain wall is given
by δ = 1/√ξ as explained previously. We perform a scaling transformation to the x coordinate as: ˜x = x/δ turning
the ODE into:

d2θ
d˜x2 −

sin θ cos θ = 0

The exact analytical solution of the above equation given by: θ(˜x) = 2 tan−1(e−˜x) is indistinguishable from the

relaxation method results displayed in ﬁg. 2.

Numerically, this means one can do the calculation for ξ = 1 and later on rescale the x variable in order to get the
solution for any value (arbitrarily large or small) of ξ. Despite the power of the relaxation method, we noticed that
when ξ

where θ is the angle the magnetization makes with the z axis (see ﬁg. 3). a plays the role of a lattice parameter, the
minimal core radius, regularising the integral (see for instance [5]). As in the Bloch wall case, we consider that θ is
a function of one spatial coordinate only (r in this case). Since the anisotropy energy is given by: K cos2 θ with K
positive, the base plane (perpendicular to the z axis) is easy, meaning the minimum of anisotropy energy is obtained
when θ = π/2 (see ﬁg.3).

The total energy minimum is found by nulling the variational derivative of E with respect to θ(r). We ﬁnd:

V. N´EEL WALLS

N´eel realized that in a regime where the thickness of a ferromagnetic ﬁlm becomes comparable to the Bloch wall
width, a transition mode within the plane can lower the total energy decisively. Unlike the Bloch wall problem where
only two energy components (exchange and anisotropy) exist balanced by a single length scale, the N´eel wall problem
incorporates two characteristic length scales. The new length arises from the competition with an additional energy
component, the internal ﬁeld energy. This has important physical, mathematical and numerical consequences. On
the physical side, a very rich behaviour of N´eel walls in thin ﬁlms was shown recently in ref. [8].
Domain structures in thin inhomogeneous ferromagnetic ﬁlms with smooth and small inhomogeneities in the exchange
and anisotropy parameters yield very complex domain structures [8]. Domain walls are ﬁxed near certain inhomo-
geneities but do not repeat their spatial distribution. In addition there are metastable chaotic domain patterns in
periodically inhomogeneous ﬁlms.
The mathematical description of N´eel walls entails the introduction of an internal magnetic ﬁeld H created by ρ the
induced pole density induced by the rotation of M . Mathematically we have divH=-divM =ρ. The magnetization
is expressed as M = (Ms sin θ(x), Ms cos θ(x), 0) in the xyz coordinates deﬁned in ﬁg. 5. Since the divergence of M
is not zero, we have an induced pole density ρ. In contrast, ρ = 0 in the Bloch wall case since we recall in this case
(see section III), M = (0, Ms sin θ(x), Ms cos θ(x)). Assuming as done previously, that the components of H depend
solely on the spatial variable x (see ﬁg. 5), we obtain:

The ODE that controls the wall proﬁle θ(x) is derived exactly as before (taking account of the exchange and

anisotropy terms) with the addition of the Zeeman term accounting for the presence of the internal ﬁeld H(x):

The uniaxial anisotropy term is K sin 2θ with θ, the angle the magnetization makes with the y axis (the anisotropy

axis).

Note that the demagnetization energy (due to the ﬁnite thickness of the ﬁlm along the z direction) is zero, since it

is given by 2πNijMiMj with Nxx = Nyy = 0, Nzz = 1, and Mz = 0.

The diﬀerence between this equation and the previous ones (Bloch and Radial cases) is that the internal ﬁeld term
H depends on the proﬁle θ(x). Writing H(x) instead of H(θ(x)) makes the wall-proﬁle equations non-autonomous
because of the explicit x dependence in H(x). Additionally these equations are integro-diﬀerential because of the
dependence of H(x) on θ(x) (see for instance [7]).
In this work we consider the thin ﬁlm approximation and retrieve a system of three ODE’s by introducing a third
function y3 = H(x)/HK with HK = 2K/Ms the anisotropy ﬁeld. The ODE system to solve is written with respect
to normalised coordinates ˜x = x/δ where δ is the wall thickness (δ = 1/√ξ where, as before, ξ = K

The magnitude of the coupling constant C = Ms

πHK has a strong eﬀect on the solution of the system. In the limit
C = 0 we recover the simple case with no internal ﬁeld H(x) = 0 like the Bloch wall case. As the magnitude of C
increases, we get a greater variation in the spatial dependence of y3(˜x) and the system might become unstable and
display numerical oscillations in spite of a drastic reduction of the integration step.

We describe below a special algorithm, that we developed, based on the relaxation method coupled to an iterative

procedure. The pseudo-code follows:

1. Initially, we introduce a guess proﬁle (say θ0(x)), extract from it the pole density ρ0(x) using eq. 15 and determine

from it the ﬁeld derivative using the divergence equation: dH(x)

dx = ρ(x).

2. The ODE system is solved and that allows us to extract a new proﬁle (say θ1(x)) that yields a new pole density

ρ1(x) (using eq. 15).

3. We repeat this procedure to the n-th step with a proﬁle θn(x) yielding a pole density ρn+1(x) that provides
a proﬁle θn+1(x). The procedure stops when the diﬀerence between the two proﬁles θn(x) and θn+1(x) in the
mean-square sense becomes smaller than an error criterion.

The latter proﬁle will have then relaxed self-consistently to the sought optimal proﬁle that minimises the total

energy (see ref. [7] and references within).

The results we obtain with various values of C for θ(˜x) and the internal ﬁeld H(˜x)/HK are displayed in ﬁg. 7 and
ﬁg. 6. The analytical result obtained for C = 0 (Bloch case), given by: θ(˜x) = 2 tan−1(e−˜x) is displayed in ﬁg. 6 and
is indistinguishable from the numerical results we obtain with the relaxation method on the system 19.
The results obtained for the internal ﬁeld displayed in ﬁg. 7 show, as expected (see for instance ref. [7]), that when
C increases, the ﬁeld (absolute) amplitude becomes larger close to the origin. In addition, as C increases the ﬁeld
extends to larger distances farther from the origin. That, in fact, points to the origin of the integro-diﬀerential nature
of the problem. Inspection of eq. 16 shows that in addition to the usual length scale (wall width) δ = 1/√ξ, we have
A/(KC) = δ/√C arising from the internal ﬁeld whose strength is given by the
another length given by: δN =
coupling constant C. As C increases, non-local eﬀects increase, the length ratio δN /δ = 1/√C decreases (making the
competition between the two lengths harder to deal with because of the disparity of the two lengths) and it becomes
more and more diﬃcult for the relaxation method to ﬁnd an optimum result satisfying the TPBVP.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The magnetic domain proﬁle is a challenging mathematical and numerical problem.

In this work, we treated
with the relaxation method, in the simple domain structure case (Q < 1), wall conﬁgurations in several interesting
physical cases: Bloch walls in ferromagnetic bulk systems, radial walls in cylindrical ferromagnetic wires and the Neel
walls in thin ferromagnetic ﬁlms assuming in all cases uniaxial anisotropy.
In the N´eel case, we showed than in the thin ﬁlm approximation (in present technology, thin means

100˚A) one

−

is able to solve the wall problem with the relaxation method with a proper selection of the variables. Nevertheless, a
major diﬃculty appears at higher value of the thickness t along the z direction (see ﬁg. 5).
When the thickness of the ﬁlm increases the system becomes a full integro-diﬀerential system whereas in the thin
ﬁlm approximation, we get a set of coupled non-linear ODE’s that we have to treat with a special self-consistent
algorithm. The non-locality of the internal ﬁeld is responsible for the appearance of logarithmic tails in the spatial
variation of the magnetization angle. That means the TPBVP must be solved over an ever increasing interval size.
The algorithm we have developed still applies but one has to use the ﬁnite thickness formulas for the ﬁeld H(x)
(eq. 24) and its derivative dH(x)
(eq. 25) as shown in the Appendix. The extension of this work to other types of walls
(originating from other types of anisotropy for instance, or the complex wall shape case Q > 1) or wall dynamics is
challenging since the wall proﬁle rapid change imposes a constraint on the time integration step.

Previously, Smith treated domain wall dynamics in small patterned magnetic soft thin (

considerably the integration process on top of the diﬃculties of the TPBVP.

The extension of this work to domain structures in inhomogeneous media (see ref. [8]) is also quite interesting,
particularly to the case of thin magnetic ﬁlms that are of high technological interest such as recording, memories
(Magnetic RAM’s and Tunnel Junctions) and Quantum computing and communication.

APPENDIX

We derive, in this Appendix, the formula for the internal ﬁeld from the induced pole density. The magnetization
is expressed as M = (Ms sin θ(x), Ms cos θ(x), 0) in the xyz coordinates deﬁned in ﬁg. 5. Since the divergence of M
is not zero, we have an induced pole density ρ(x). The internal ﬁeld is obtained from the pole density by integration
accounting for the ﬁnite thickness of the ﬁlm.

Grasers based on a stimulated emission of gravitational radiation by relativistic
charged particle beams in external ﬁelds and on conversion of laser radiation into grav-
itational one in the magnetic ﬁelds as well as detectors are discussed. It was pointed
out on a scheme where the gravitational radiation is not accompanied by an useless
inaccessible by a value average power of the electromagnetic radiation. A stimulation of
the conversion of gravitons into photons in gravitational detectors by an open resonator

Introduction

The contribution of the gravitational interaction to other kinds of interactions between
elementary particles is very small. That is why to investigate the nature of the gravitational
ﬁeld and it’s interaction with another ﬁelds (conversion of gravitons into photons and other
particles and so on) we are forced to use pure gravitational radiation for this purpose. On
the way to this goal ﬁrst of all we must prove the real existence of gravitational waves
and study theirs properties. Then we could solve the problem of the choice of a proper
relativistic theory of gravity, to continue the development of this theory and to verify it’s
predictions through new experiments [1]. If it will be possible one day the next step could
be the investigation of the signiﬁcance of the gravity in the elementary particle physics.

Nowadays the eﬀorts on experimental investigation of foundations of the theory of grav-
ity are concentrated on the detection of gravitational radiation coming from the universe.
However the wavelengths of the existing natural sources of the gravitational radiation like
double stars is very high (period is about 1 day). The intensity of these and other more hard
natural gravitational radiation sources is very small [2]. Phenomena similar to Supernovae
1kHz) gravitational radiation is
explosions (when much higher power and frequency (
emitted) don’t often happen. That is why we are forced to produce an artiﬁcial source of
hard gravitational radiation. One of the possible versions of such source is the gravitational
analogue of Laser named a Graser. The necessity in Grasers is similar to that in nuclear
research when particle accelerators began to be used instead of cosmic rays.

∼

In this paper both Grasers based on a direct emission of gravitational waves by nonuni-
formly moving prebunched ion beams in undulators (parametric Free-Ion Grasers) and
Grasers based on the conversion of gaussian laser beams stored in an open resonator into
gravitational beams in a transverse magnetostatic ﬁelds are considered. It was shown that
one of optimal solutions of the problem of a Graser based on direct emission of gravitational
radiation by particles can be a Graser based on an undulator, a cutoﬀ waveguide arranged
in the undulator and a relativistic heavy ion beam. Such Graser is working under conditions
when a gravitational radiation is not accompanied by the useless electromagnetic radiation
with an inaccessible by a value average power. In the relativistic case these conditions are
valid at wavelengths much less then the cutoﬀ one. An eﬀective method of stimulation of
the conversion process of gravitons into photons in a transverse magnetic ﬁeld, multilayer
mirrors and other systems of gravitational detectors by a resonator are considered.

2 Emission of gravitational radiation

Weak gravitational processes in a weak gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth can be described
in the Euclidian space. In static the Coulomb’s law of forces between electric charges and
Newton’s law of the universal gravitation have the same dependence of forces on a distance
1/R2) and on theirs charges e and masses M . It means that in the
R between particles (
case of gravitational ﬁeld we can introduce the gravitational charge egr = √G M and use it
in the static gravity theory the same way as the electric charge is used in the electrostatic,
where G = 6.67 10−8 is the gravitational constant. The diﬀerence in the formulas of these
lows is only in the sign. Gravitational ﬁeld is always attractive ﬁeld for all particles.

∼

We can extend this analogy from static to dynamic of charges, forces and ﬁelds and

2

suppose that gravitational ﬁeld of moving particle in general case (that is in an arbitrary
reference frame and arbitrary particle motion) will have both the analogy of the electric ~Egr
and analogy of the magnetic ~Bgr ﬁeld strengths determined by a gravitational charge egr,
velocity and acceleration. If we proceed from this supposition and from the equivalence of
the inertial reference frames then in order to this analogy was fruitful we must determine the
dynamical lows of gravity. At that we can proceed from the analogy with the dynamical
approach to the construction of the special theory of relativity (G.Lorentz, A.Poincare)
[3]. The simplest low can be found by considering some particular problems with known
solution. In particular we know that a system of 2 identical particles with masses M and in
a charge state n+ will be in equilibrium in any arbitrary moving coordinate system when
it is in equilibrium in a coordinate system at rest (G M 2 = (n+)2e2). If the gravitational
force is higher (G M 2 > (n+)2e2) then such system will be in the state of rotation. At that
in accordance with the relativistic transformations the longitudinal dimension of the orbits
of particles will be compressed and the period of rotation will be increased relative to the
laboratory coordinate system when the center of mass is moving with a relativistic velocity.
It means that the electromagnetic and gravitational transformations of forces and ﬁelds
must be the same and the equations of gravity must be similar to the Maxwell’s equations
[4], [5]. Otherwise the laws of the particle motion will have diﬀerent forms in diﬀerent rest
frames moving with diﬀerent velocities if gravitational, electromagnetic and any other forces
between particles will have diﬀerent transformation properties.

So in a general case time-varying week gravitational analogies of electric and magnetic
ﬁelds in the ﬁrst approximation are described by the wave equations which are similar to
the wave equations of the electromagnetic ﬁelds (with the accuracy to signs of terms of the
equations which include the density of charges). The solution of the gravitational equations
for the nonuniformly moving particle which undergo the inﬂuence of the extraneous ﬁelds
will lead to the gravitational analogies of the electromagnetic ﬁelds of the form similar to
Lienard-Viechert’s form for the electromagnetic ﬁelds.

It follows that the nonuniformly moving charged particle will emit the gravitational ra-
diation with the same parameters (except power) as the electromagnetic radiation of these
particles in free space (the inﬂuence of the boundary conditions for the gravitational radia-
tion is negligible). That is why we can declare that Free-Particle Lasers will emit stimulated
gravitational radiation simultaneously with the stimulated electromagnetic radiation. These
kinds of radiation emitted in the conditions of free space will have identical spectral and an-
gular distributions1. The ratio of the power of the gravitational to electromagnetic radiation
1According to this concept we can draw the conclusion that all sources of the electromagnetic radiation
(thermal sources, lasers, klystrons and so on) are the sources of the gravitational radiation simultaneously.
The diﬀerence between emission of electrons in undulator of Free-Electron Laser and in an atom is in the
fact that a nucleon emit gravitational wave of the same amplitude as an electron but opposite polarity
(theirs accelerations have opposite directions and inverse to theirs masses and the emitted ﬁeld strengths are
proportional to theirs masses and accelerations). As the wavelength of the emitted radiation in this case is
much higher then the dimension of the atom then the diﬀerence between phases of the emitted radiation and
π is negligible and the power of the emitted radiation will be suppressed. It will appear in the approximation
β2 = (v/c)2, where v, c are the velocities of the electron and light accordingly. In this case in the correlation
(1) a coeﬃcient Cα = Cα0 ≃ β2 ≪ 1 will appear. However in the case of an extended media photons emitted
by an atom can be absorbed by another atoms of media with high probability and gravitons will go away
from media with very small absorption. That is why for the case of lasers based on high quality resonators
and without extraction of the emitted electromagnetic radiation or large sources like stars the ratio of the

2.1 Grasers based on particle emission in undulators

The total energy, hardness and directivity of the gravitational radiation of particles emitted
in the magnetic ﬁelds of undulators is strongly increased with the increase of the relativistic
factor γ. The number of the emitted both photons and gravitons in this case does not
depend on γ. Free-Ion Lasers based on proton and more heavy ion beams of storage rings
can emit more powerful coherent electromagnetic and gravitational radiation then Free-
Electron Lasers of the same relativistic factor [7] - [10]. This is because of the total energy
of ion beams stored in ion storage rings is much higher then the total energy of electron
beams stored in electron rings. Grasers based on ion beams according to (1) have an
additional advantage as the ratio of the gravitational to electromagnetic powers of the
emitted radiation is proportional to the square of mass. This is important as a weak power
of the gravitational radiation will be accompanied by the extremely high useless power of
the electromagnetic radiation. The value of the power of the electromagnetic radiation
have the inaccessible high value for electrons and light ions. Very hard conditions are in
92 U 1+ and more heavy formations as well. For example if we

2In ordinary Free-Ion Lasers rather long distance is necessary before a homogeneous ion beam will be
bunched when starting from noise (self ampliﬁed stimulated emission) or week external electromagnetic
wave. Only after bunching the ion beam can eﬀectively produce radiation. Moreover the degree of the
beam bunching in these cases is not high. Because of this factors the Parametric Free-Particle Lasers based
on high degree bunched beams have limiting parameters for the rate of the energy loss. They will emit
monochromatic, polarized, diﬀractionally limited radiation as well [7] - [10], [12], [13].

to produce a long train of more short microbunches. The bunching frequency in this case is
very high (the distance between bunches is equal or multiple to the wavelength of the laser
beam). To prepare ion beams for Grasers in ion storage rings the same beam bunching
problems can be solved by the same or special bunching technique [21]. Instead of a three
dimensional Synchrotron Radiation Damping using in electron storage rings a Radiative Ion
Cooling based on the process of resonance Rayleigh scattering of a laser light by relativistic
ions [22], [9], [10] or ordinary Laser Cooling under conditions of synchro-betatron resonance
[23], [24], [25] can be used in ion storage rings. Ion cooling may make it possible to store
very high current low-emittance ion beams using multiple injection of ions in high energy
storage rings. The beam stored energy of the LHC will exceed the value 500 MJ (average
current

In section 2 we introduced gravitational charge egr for a particle with a mass M . We can
do the next step and suppose that all forms of ﬁelds enable a density of energy ρ = w/c2
and a corresponding charge density ρgr = √Gρ.
In the case of electromagnetic ﬁelds

sity of the energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is varied with time then a varying with time
gravitational charge density will appear and the conditions for the emission of the gravita-
tional radiation can appear. For example, the superposition of static electromagnetic ﬁeld
and electromagnetic wave in vacuum will lead to a formation of a modulated gravitational
charge density propagating together with electromagnetic wave the same direction with

7

light velocity and to emission of gravitational wave.

Electrogravitational conversion of an electromagnetic radiation to gravitational one was
known to Whittaker as early as 1947 [28]. Gertsenshtein was the ﬁrst to actually calcu-
late the conversion eﬃciency of a plane electromagnetic wave into gravitational one in a
transverse magnetic ﬁeld [29], [30]. The conversion of free electromagnetic wave into grav-
itational one is lacking but in the simplest case of two counter propagating waves it take
place [33], [34].

The way based on the conversion of the electromagnetic laser beam into the gravitational
one in a one-directional transverse magnetic ﬁeld is presented on Fig.2. On this ﬁgure an
open resonator presented by two mirrors M1, M2. The resonator is located outside of the
magnet poles. The distance between mirrors Lm is higher then the length of the magnet
L. It can be exited by continuous beam of Free Electron or Free-Ion Laser. Conversion of
electromagnetic beam into gravitational one takes place in the magnetic ﬁeld. The envelop
of the gravitational beam coincides with the mode envelop of the electromagnetic radiation
in the resonator. Outside of the resonator the electromagnetic radiation is absent but the
gravitational radiation is propagated in the limits of the prolonged resonator mode envelop.

3 Detectors of the gravitational radiation

The schemes of detectors of artiﬁcial sources of gravitational waves can be based both on
the coherent emission of the electromagnetic radiation by charged particle beams or another
charged formations accelerated by the gravitational waves and on an inverse conversion of
gravitons into photons in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld. Multilayer mirrors can be created
from charged electron and ion beams in storage rings (moving multilayer mirrors) [21] or
from transparent charged dielectric layers placed along the way of the gravitational beam.

The coeﬃcient of reﬂection of electromagnetic waves by a thin layer of electrons is equal

radiation [35]. When electrons are arranged in Ml layers then in this case the maximal
coeﬃcient of reﬂection will be M 2

By analogy the gravitational waves will lead to an acceleration of electrons of the multi-
layer mirror and hence to emission of electromagnetic waves. The converted electromagnetic
waves will propagate the same direction as the reﬂected electromagnetic waves. The conver-
sion coeﬃcient of the gravitational radiation to electromagnetic one in this case will be less

magnetic one; M1, M2: Mirrors; BE: Beam Envelop of an
electromagnetic radiation; M3: Mirror for extraction of radiation.

The propagating in the direction of the axis ”y” gravitational radiation will be converted
into electromagnetic radiation by charged layers. The open resonator with a quality Q will
stimulate the conversion process Q times. As a result the ﬂow of photons will be increased
Q2 times inside and Q times outside of the system. The phases of the waves emitted by
layers with opposite polarities will diﬀer on π. The velocity of gravitational waves are equal
to light velocity in any case but the velocity of the electromagnetic waves will depend on
the refraction index of the media. That is why we can choose the distance between layers
such a way that the emitted electromagnetic waves will be in phase forward or backward
directions.

an open resonator

If in the scheme of Fig.3 the media in a resonator is absent but mirrors M 1 and M 2 are
charged then such system will be excited. The eﬃciency of such system will be much
less then in the previous case. Detectors based on the emission of charged capacitor with
transparent for radiation plates in vacuum was considered in [36].

3.4 Detectors based on conversion of gravitons into photons in a transverse mag-

netic ﬁeld

The conversion of the gravitational radiation into electromagnetic one can be produced
in the conversion scheme which is reverse one to the scheme presented in the Fig.2 [4],
[37]. The gravitational radiation in this scheme propagates in the direction of axis ”y” and
is converted to an electromagnetic radiation in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld and in the
electromagnetic ﬁeld stored in the open resonator. The conversion coeﬃcient in this case is

4 On a possibility of laboratory gravitational experiments

The combined symmetrical scheme of an experiment based on double conversion of electro-
magnetic to gravitational radiation and back is presented on Fig.4. In this scheme two equal
semi-confocal resonators of the length Lm each are presented by mirrors M 1 - M 3. M 3 is
a thick ﬂat mirror, which is simultaneously the absorber of the powerful electromagnetic
radiation exited in the left resonator.

In this case the ratio of the reactive power of the electromagnetic radiation stored into the
right resonator to the active power of electromagnetic radiation supplying the left resonator

5 Conclusion

The direct way of emission of gravitational waves by charged ions nonuniformly moving
in external electromagnetic or gravitational ﬁelds and conversion of the electromagnetic
radiation into gravitational one and back in the transverse magnetic ﬁelds have a diﬀerent
nature. Both of them are in the Einstein’s theory of gravity [39]. Nevertheless second one
is not so obvious. That is why they are need personal veriﬁcation in the emission and
conversion processes. The lack of the conversion process will not mean the lack of the
gravitational radiation emitted by the nonuniformly moving particles.

The power of any gravitational radiation source is very small and an interaction of
gravitational waves with any feasible detector is very small. This is the reason why people
were not able to conﬁrm the existence of such radiation. Nowadays the experimental eﬀorts

14

are concentrated on the detection of Gravitational Radiation coming from very intense
astrophysical sources, such as Supernovae explosions, by means of cryogenic resonant bars
and interferometers. Artiﬁcial sources of gravitational waves under human control will be
the next step in an accurate study the nature of the gravitational radiation, its connection
with another theories and its uniﬁcation with other forces. An experiment of laboratory
production and detection of gravitational waves would justify eﬀorts comparable with those
done for particle accelerators. This happened in particle physics after the introduction of
accelerators beside of the use of cosmic ray detectors.

Unfortunately the intensity we can produce with the artiﬁcial gravitational radiation
sources proposed until now is much smaller then requested by the sensitivity of the possible
detectors actually conceived. This could discourage on the possibility to realize an experi-
ment of production and detection of gravitational waves in laboratory within not extremely
long times. However some people are optimist, and think that such an experiment will be
done within the next century. For this reason it is important to continue in conceiving,
studying and improving ideas for possible man made sources of gravitational waves and for
suitable detectors. If one rely on the rapid technological increasing and on the continuous
ﬂow of new ideas, it can hope the man will be able to do an experiments of such kinds
within next century [31].

We hope that using of Grasers based on cold heavy ion beams (or more heavy charged
formations) and cutoﬀ waveguides or on conversion of electromagnetic waves in the trans-
verse magnetic ﬁeld as well as using detectors with stimulation of graviton conversion by
high quality resonator and maybe another ideas (quantum nondemolition measurements
[40], using ampliﬁcation by active media and so on [41], [42]) instill an additional hope in
the reality of the experiments on the veriﬁcation of the gravitational theories.

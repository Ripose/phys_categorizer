We give a closed expression of Minkowski 1+1-dimensional metric in the radar coordinates of
an arbitrary non-inertial observer. Then we prove that every oriented conformally ﬂat coordi-
nate system can be regarded as the radar coordinate system of a suitable observer for a suitable
parametrization of the observer worldline.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In this work we consider a non-inertial observer O in
unidirectional, but otherwise arbitrary, motion in the
Minkowski 2-dimensional spacetime of metric signature
(+−). The Minkowski metric has the expression ds2 =
dt2 − dx2 where x and t are coordinates of an inertial
frame K and where units have been chosen such that
c = 1. Let γ(τ ) be the arbitrary timelike worldline of the
non-inertial observer, τ the proper time parametrization
and uµ = dxµ/dτ with µ = 0, 1 the covariant velocity.

The non-inertial observer can construct coordinates us-
ing diﬀerent methods. The transformation between in-
ertial and non-inertial coordinates should reduce to a
Lorentz transformation if the observer has vanishing ac-
celeration. This requirement, however, is too weak in
order to determine a unique solution. There are at least
three possibilities that have been considered in the liter-
ature

(a) Radar (M¨arzke-Wheeler) coordinates1,2,3,4,

(b) Fermi coordinates5,6,

(c) Møller coordinates7,8.

Even more possibilities arise if the observer is not re-
garded as isolated but as part of an extended refer-
ence frame28 where no worldline has a privileged role9,10.
In this last case the coordinate systems would depend
even on the rigidity assumptions that constrain the
frame11,12,13,14.

Here we shall focus on the radar coordinates (they were
also used in the study of the rotating platform, see15,16).
The reader should keep in mind that these coordinates
are not related to measurements performed with stan-
dard rods and clocks. They are just convenient labels
of the spacetime events. However, in a neighborhood of
the observer worldline, since they approximate the coor-
dinates of a comoving inertial frame, they do represent
measurements performed by rods and clocks. For exam-
ple, the radar distance becomes the distance that would
be measured using standard rods2.

Let us recall the deﬁnition of radar coordinates. Let E
be an event of spacetime and consider the light beam L2
emitted at E. It reaches O’s worldline at a proper time

τ2(E). Consider also the light beam L2 that emitted at
a suitable proper time τ1(E) reaches E. Using the radar
procedure the observer O assigns to E a time label given
by τ2(E)+τ1(E)
. Note that if E = γ(τ ) then the time label
assigned to E is just τ . For this reason the time label will
be denoted with the same letter

2

Next O assigns to the event a radar distance given by

τ (E) =

τ2(E) + τ1(E)
2

.

d(E) =

τ2(E) − τ1(E)
2

.

(2)

It is, however, more convenient to deﬁne a spacial coor-
dinate χ rather than a distance, through the deﬁnition
χ = ±d with the plus sign if E stays to the right of
the curve γ(τ ) or the minus sign if E stays to the left.
It is also convenient to introduce the quantities τ +(E)

and τ −(E). These quantities coincide respectively with
τ 2(E) and τ 1(E) if E stays to the right of the curve
γ(τ ) whereas, on the contrary, they coincide respectively
with τ 1(E) and τ 2(E). We may say that τ + determines
the intersection event between γ and a light beam mov-
ing from the right to the left while τ − determines the
intersection event between γ and a light beam moving
from the left to the right. With these deﬁnitions we have
(radar coordinates)

τ (E) =

τ +(E) + τ −(E)
2

,

χ(E) =

τ +(E) − τ −(E)

,

where τ +(E) and τ −(E) are directly observable quanti-
ties. The radar coordinates are deﬁned in the intersection
between the causal future and the causal past of the curve
γ. Outside this region τ2, τ1, or both, are not deﬁned. A
typical example is the constant acceleration case. Only
the events in the Rindler wedge −x < t < x, admit
two light beams passing through them that intersect the
curve γ, thus deﬁning τ2 and τ1.

Let us introduce the coordinates x± = t ± x such that

the Minkowski metric takes the form

ds2 = dx+dx

−

.

(5)

Note that the events with a given value of τ ± lie in a
plane of equation x± = cnst. This will be central in what
follows and justiﬁes the introduction of τ + and τ − in
place of τ2 and τ1.

Finally, let us introduce the acceleration of the non-
inertial observer. It is given by aµ = ∇uuµ where ∇ is
the Levi-Civita connection of the Minkowski metric. In
particular since u · u = 1 we have diﬀerentiating a · u =
0 and hence a is spacelike. Let e1 be the normalized
(e1 · e1 = −1) spacelike vector orthogonal to u oriented
towards the increasing x (e1[x] > 0). Since a · u = 0 we
have aµ(τ ) = a(τ )eµ
1 (τ ) where a is the acceleration of O
with respect to the local inertial frame. Said in another
way, −a(τ ) is the apparent acceleration of free particles
with respect to the accelerated observer.

Our aim is to prove the following result

Theorem I.1. In the radar coordinates (τ, χ) the
Minkowski metric takes the form

ds2 = e

R

′

(dτ 2 − dχ2).

(6)

This theorem generalizes to arbitrary motions the con-
stant acceleration case considered by Lass17 where he
ﬁnds, starting from a set of assumptions,

ds2 = e2aχ(dτ 2 − dχ2).

(7)

The fact that the coordinates τ and χ were in fact radar
coordinates of the uniformly accelerated observer was
pointed out only later18. Other works that discuss the
constant acceleration case are12,19,20,21. It seems remark-
able that the problem could be solved completely without
restricting assumptions. Notice that at time τ the non-
inertial observer knows the spacetime coordinates (χ, τ )
of the events in the causal past of γ(τ ). At the same time
the observer can immediately calculate the metric in its
causal past from the knowledge of the acceleration a as
measured by a comoving accelerometer. It is also inter-
esting to notice that the metric at an event E is deter-
mined by the acceleration of the observer in events that
are spacelike separated from E. Indeed, the integral that
appears in Eq. (6) is between τ −(E) and τ +(E). From
(6) we see that the radar coordinates are conformally

(4)

related with the inertial coordinates, thus the speed of
light in the radar coordinates is equal to one in both
directions12, indeed ds2 = 0 ⇒ |dχ/dτ | = 1.

Proof. Since the level set of the function τ ± coincides
with that of the function x± there are functions g+ and
g− such that

x+ = g+(τ +),

The wordline γ has equation χ = 0 and along that world-
line ds = dτ and τ + = τ − = τ thus g+′
(τ ) = 1.
This argument could also be found in Jones22. From it
we conclude that there is a function G(τ ) such that

the form

ds2 = eG(τ +χ)−G(τ −χ)(dτ 2 − dχ2).

(12)

This metric shows that e1 = ∂/∂χ along the worldline
χ = 0.

Now, let us make a little digression and consider a

Let uµ = dxµ/ds with ds2 = gµν dxµdxν . Making the
variation we obtain

gµν∇uuν = (δα

µ − uαuµ)∂α ln Ω,

(14)

where ∇ is the Levi-Civita connection of gµν.

Let us return to our original problem and let g =
dt2 − dx2 be the Minkowski metric, g′ = dτ 2 − dχ2 and
Ω−2 = eG(τ +χ)−G(τ −χ). The worldline χ = 0 is clearly a
geodesic for the metric g′ and therefore if uµ and aµ are
the covariant velocity and acceleration of O we have

aµ = −

conformally ﬂat coordinates if the metric (in our case the
Minkowski metric) takes the form ds2 = Ω(T , X )2(dT 2 −
dX 2) for a suitable positive function Ω. Let R be the
coordinate transformation from the inertial coordinates
(t, x) to the conformally ﬂat coordinates (T , X ),
i.e.
(T , X ) = R(t, x) and deﬁne the coordinates (T ′, X ′) =
R◦P (t, x) where P is a Poincar`e transformation then the
spacetime metric in the primed coordinates has the same
functional dependence as with respect to the unprimed
coordinates, ds2 = Ω(T ′, X ′)2(dT ′2 − dX ′2). However,
we stress that (T , X ) and (T ′, X ′) are distinct confor-
mally ﬂat coordinates.

Note that if (T , X ) is a conformally ﬂat coordinate
system then ∂T is timelike and either past-pointing or
future-pointing. Analogously ∂X is spacelike and either
left-pointing or right-pointing. We restrict our attention
to conformally ﬂat coordinate system for which ∂T is
future-pointing and ∂X is right-pointing. Otherwise we
have only to make the replacement T → −T or/and
X → −X . We shall call them oriented conformally ﬂat
coordinate systems.

where v(0) and and (t(0), x(0)) are the velocity and po-
sition of O with respect to K at τ = 0. For a = 0
this transformation becomes a Poincar´e transformation
between an inertial frame moving at speed v(0) and K.

Theorem II.1. Let (T , X ) be oriented conformally ﬂat
coordinates in 1+1 Minkowski spacetime, then (T , X ) are
radar coordinates of the parametrized curve γ(T ) of equa-
tion X = 0.

II. AN INVERSE RESULT

The radar coordinates of O are obtained from the
proper time measurements τ + and τ −. Suppose that
O parametrizes the worldline γ using a new parameter
T = f (τ ) with f ′ > 0. Suppose, moreover, that O still
makes use of the radar method in order to extend a coor-
dinate system over spacetime. In place of τ ± the observer
measures T ± = f (τ ±) and assigns to the generic event
E of coordinates (τ, χ) the coordinates

T =

X =

f (τ + χ) + f (τ − χ)
2
f (τ + χ) − f (τ − χ)
2

,

.

(20)

(21)

Transformations of this form will be called worldline
reparametrizations independently of the physical inter-
pretation of the coordinates. Given a worldline γ the
worldline reparametrizations form a group of coordinate
transformations, moreover in this group there is a partic-
ular choice of coordinates that corresponds to the proper
time parametrization, that ultimately used in practice.
In what follows all the coordinate systems in the group
will be considered as radar coordinates for the worldline
γ. We shall say that (T , X ) are radar coordinates of
the parametrized curve γ(T ) while (τ, χ) are radar co-
ordinates of the parametrized curve γ(τ ) (proper radar
coordinates).

We are now going to give a result that may be thought
as the inverse of theorem I.1. We recall that (T , X ) are

An important consequence of the theorem is

Corollary II.2. Up to worldline reparametrizations
there is a one-to-one correspondence between oriented
conformally ﬂat coordinate systems in 1+1 Minkowski
spacetime and observers (timelike worldlines).
Proof. Deﬁne T ± = T ± X , the level sets of T ± are null
and hence we have that T ± is a function of x±(here we
use the fact that ∂T is future-pointing and ∂X is right-
pointing). Substituting in dx+dx− = Ω2dT +dT − it fol-
lows that Ω2 = exp[H +(T +) + H −(T −)] for suitable
functions H − and H +. The same result could have been
derived noting that the Ricci scalar in two spacetime di-
mensions reads23, R = −Ω−2(∂2
X ) ln Ω2 and that
since we are assuming a ﬂat metric R = 0. Deﬁne the

Let γ be the timelike curve X = 0, then the previous
equations show that τ is the proper time parametrization
of γ since there T ± = T and hence τ + = τ − = τ . In
particular, according to the proof of theorem I.1, the pre-
vious formula shows that the acceleration of γ is a(τ ) =
G′(τ ). The coordinates (τ, χ) are therefore the proper
radar coordinates of γ and hence (T , X ) were radar co-
ordinates with respect to the worldline parametrization
γ(T ).

III. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

We have given the transformation between the radar
coordinates of an arbitrarily accelerating observer and
the radar coordinates of an inertial observer. A closed
expression for the spacetime metric in the former coor-
dinates in terms of the acceleration of the non-inertial
observer has also been given. Then we have shown that
every oriented conformally ﬂat coordinate system repre-
sents, up to a worldline reparametrization, an observer.
Since every observer is represented by an oriented con-
formally ﬂat coordinate system, the coordinate trans-
formation between two arbitrary observers is in fact a
conformal transformation. A 1+1-dimensional theory in-
variant under conformal transformations would therefore
give rise to the same physics for all the observers inde-

4

pendently of their relative motion. Actually, we know
that this symmetry should be broken in some place in a
Lagrangian that deﬁnes a realistic physical theory. Oth-
erwise, it would be impossible to measure the acceleration
with an accelerometer.

These considerations are related to analogous conclu-
sions that have been reached in the study of higher di-
mensional cases. Since for more than two dimensions
the conformal group has only ﬁfteen generators it can
represent only the coordinate transformations between
uniformly accelerated observers24,25 (this should be com-
pared with the 2-dimensional case considered here where
the conformal group has an inﬁnite number of genera-
tors). The Maxwell equations being invariant under con-
formal transformations determine a physics which would
appear to be the same in uniformly accelerating and in-
ertial frames, however, the mass term in the Lorentz
force equation ultimately spoils the symmetry leading to
the possibility of determining the acceleration of a frame
looking at the motion of charged particles26,27.

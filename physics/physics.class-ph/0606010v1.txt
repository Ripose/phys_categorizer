Lagrangian mechanics uses d’Alembert’s principle of zero virtual work as an important starting
point. The orthogonality of the force of constraint and virtual displacement is emphasized in liter-
ature, without a clear warning that this is true usually for a single particle system. For a system
of particles connected by constraints, it is shown, that the virtual work of the entire system is zero,
even though the virtual displacements of the particles are not perpendicular to the respective con-
straint forces. It is also demonstrated why d’Alembert’s principle involves virtual work rather than
the work done by constraint forces on allowed displacements.

INTRODUCTION

The principle of zero work by constraint forces on virtual displacement, also known as d’Alembert’s principle, is an
important step in formulating and solving a mechanical problem with constraints1,2,3,4,5. In the simple systems widely
used in literature, e.g., a single particle rolling down a frictionless incline, or a simple pendulum with inextensible
ideal string, the force of constraint is perpendicular to the virtual displacement. This results in zero virtual work
by constraint forces. It is often tempting to assume that the constraint forces are always orthogonal to respective
virtual displacements, even for a system of particles. d’Alembert’s principle then seems to be a consequence of this
orthogonality1,3,5.

In this article we study two simple systems: a double pendulum and an N -pendulum. In these systems it is observed
that, the virtual displacements are not perpendicular to the respective constraint forces acting on individual particles
(pendulum bobs). However, d’Alembert’s principle of zero virtual work still holds for the systems as a whole. In these
problems, the principle of zero virtual work is a consequence of, (i) the relation between the virtual displacements of
coupled components (neighbouring bobs), and (ii) the appearance of (Newtonian) action-reaction pairs in forces of
constraint between neighbouring particles. Thus d’Alembert’s principle is more subtle and involved than it is often
thought to be. Greenwood has rightly said, “... workless constraints do no work on the system as a whole in an
arbitrary virtual displacement. Quite possibly, however, the workless constraint forces will do work on individual
particles of the system”2.

II. DOUBLE PENDULUM

Let us ﬁrst consider a double pendulum, with inextensible ideal strings of lengths L1 and L2. Let r1 and r2 denote
the instantaneous positions of the pendulum bobs P1 and P2, with respect to the point of suspension (see ﬁgure 1).
When the system is suspended from a stationary support; the holonomic, scleronomous constraint equations are,
|r1| = L1,

|r1 − r2| = L2.

(1)

(r2 − r1) · (v2 − v1) = 0.

The equations for allowed velocities are obtained by diﬀerentiating (1) with respect to t,
r1 · v1 = 0,
(2)
Thus, the allowed velocity v1 of P1 is orthogonal to its position vector r1. The relative velocity of the second bob
(v2 − v1) with respect to the ﬁrst, is orthogonal to the relative position vector r21 = (r2 − r1). Let ˆn1 and ˆn2 be unit
vectors orthogonal to (r1) and (r2 − r1) respectively,
ˆn1 · r1 = 0

ˆn2 · (r2 − r1) = 0.

and

(3)

From (2) and (3) we obtain the allowed velocities as,
v1 = b1 ˆn1,

v2 − v1 = b2 ˆn2 ⇒ v2 = v1 + b2 ˆn2

(4)

2

where b1 and b2 are arbitrary real constants, denoting the magnitude of the relevant vectors.

The virtual velocities are deﬁned as a diﬀerence between two allowed velocities,

displacements drk, and the virtual displacements δrk are then given by,

vk = vk − v′

dr1 = v1 dt = dq1 ˆn1,
δr1 = dr1 − dr′

1 = (dq1 − dq′

1)ˆn1 = δq1 ˆn1.

dr2 = v2dt = v1dt + b2 ˆn2dt = dr1 + dq2 ˆn2,
δr2 = (dr1 + dq2 ˆn2) − (dr′

1 + +dq′

2 ˆn2) = δr1 + δq2 ˆn2.

(5)

(6)

It may be noted that, under the given holonomic, scleronomous constraints (velocity and time independent), the set
of allowed and virtual displacements are equivalent.

A set of allowed displacements {dr1, dr2} is obtained by a speciﬁc choice of the numbers {b1, b2} or {dq1, dq2}. By

making diﬀerent choices of the set {dq1, dq2} we get a whole family of allowed displacements, {drk}, where,
{drk} ⇒ {dr1, dr2}{b1,b2} = {dr1, dr2}{dq1,dq2}.

Or more precisely,

{drk} ⇒ {{dr1, dr2}{b1,b2}|b1, b2 ∈ ℜ}

{δrk} ⇒ {δr1, δr2}{δq1,δq2}.

where ℜ is the set of real numbers. Similarly, by choosing diﬀerent set of quantities {δq1, δq2} we get the family of
virtual displacements, {δrk}, where,

Thus, it is easy to see that for holonomic, scleronomous constraints, the set of all possible allowed displacements
is the same as the set of all possible virtual displacements. This is in agreement with the fact that for holonomic,
scleronomous systems, the set {drk} and {δrk} satisfy the same equations7, namely,

r1 · dr1 = 0,
r1 · δr1 = 0,

(r2 − r1) · (dr2 − dr1) = 0
(r2 − r1) · (δr2 − δr1) = 0

As the pendulums are suspended by inextensible ideal strings, one may assume that the tensions in the strings act
along their lengths. This essentially implies that there is no shear in the string to transmit transverse force. Thus the
tension T1 is along (−r1) and tension T2 is along (r1 − r2). Hence, the virtual displacement δr1 for the ﬁrst pendulum
is perpendicular to the tension T1, but the virtual displacement δr2 of the second pendulum is not perpendicular to
T2.
T1 · δr1 = 0
T2 · δr2 = T2 · (δr1 + δq2 ˆn2) = T2 · δr1 + (T2 · ˆn2)δq2 = T2 · δr1

(7)

At this stage one may appreciate that T1 is not the entire force of constraint on P1. As a reaction to P1 pulling P2
with a tension T2, the second bob P2 pulls the ﬁrst bob P1 with a tension (−T2). Thus the virtual work by constraint
forces acting on P1 and P2 are given by,

δW1 = R1 · δr1 = (T1 − T2) · δr1 = −T2 · δr1 6= 0
δW2 = R2 · δr2 = T2 · (δr1 + δq2 ˆn2) = T2 · δr1 6= 0.

Although neither δW1 nor δW2 is zero, their sum adds up to zero. Thus the “equal and opposite” Newtonian reaction
comes to our rescue, and we have a cancellation in the total virtual work.

δW1 + δW2 = R1 · δr1 + R2 · δr2 = −T2 · δr1 + T2 · δr1 = 0

This shows that in the case of a double pendulum with stationary support, d’Alembert’s principle utilizes the equal
and opposite nature of the tensions between neighbouring bobs (Newtonian action-reaction pair).

Let us now consider the double pendulum with a moving point of suspension. This gives us a system with a
rheonomous constraint. Let the velocity of the point of suspension be v0. The constraint equations in this case are,

The only non-trivial modiﬁcation is that, the virtual displacements are no longer equivalent to the allowed displace-
ments.

|r1 − v0t| = L1,

|r2 − r1| = L2

For the ﬁrst bob P1,
dr1 = v1 dt = v0 dt + dq1 ˆn1,
δr1 = dr1 − dr′

1 = (v0dt\ \ + dq1 ˆn1) − (v0dt\ \ + dq′

1 ˆn1) = (dq1 − dq′
Therefore virtual displacement δr1 is a vector along ˆn1, whereas allowed displacement dr1 is sum of a vector along
ˆn1 and a vector along v0. For the second bob P2,

1)ˆn1 = δq1 ˆn1.

(11)

dr2 = v2dt = v1dt + b2 ˆn2dt = v0dt + dq1 ˆn1 + dq2 ˆn2
δr2 = (v0dt\ \ + dq1 ˆn1 + dq2 ˆn2) − (v0dt\ \ + dq′
1 ˆn1 + dq′

2 ˆn2) = δq1 ˆn1 + δq2 ˆn2.

Thus dr1 and dr2 are not equivalent to δr1 and δr2. However the relation between δr1 and δr2 remains the same as
in the case of a double pendulum with stationary support.

δr2 = δr1 + δq2 ˆn2

Hence the above inferences, in particular, (7), (8), (9) are true even in this case.

III. N -PENDULUM

It is instructive to repeat the above exercise for a system of N -pendulum joined end to end by inextensible, ideal
strings. Let r1, r2, . . . , rN denote the instantaneous position vectors of pendulum bobs P1, P2, . . . , PN respectively, as
shown in ﬁgure 2. The constraint equations for this system are,

|r1| = L1,

|rk − rk−1| = Lk,

k = 2, 3, . . . , N.

The equations for allowed velocities, obtained by diﬀerentiating the above equations, are

r1 · v1 = 0,

(rk − rk−1) · (vk − vk−1) = 0,

k = 2, 3, . . . , N.

Let us introduce unit vectors ˆn1, ˆn2, . . . ˆnN , where ˆnk is normal to the relative position of the bob Pk with respect to
Pk−1, i.e., (rk − rk−1).

ˆn1 · r1 = 0,

ˆnk · (rk − rk−1) = 0,

k = 2, 3, . . . , N.

From (15) and (16), the allowed velocities are given by

v1 = b1 ˆn1,

vk − vk−1 = bk ˆnk ⇒ vk = vk−1 + bk ˆnk,

k = 2, 3, . . . , N.

(tension)

where {bk, k = 1, . . . , N } are a set of real constants denoting the magnitude of the relevant vectors. The allowed
displacements drk and the virtual displacements δrk are,

dr1 = b1 ˆn1dt = dq1 ˆn1,
dr2 = dr1 + b2 ˆn2dt = dr1 + dq2 ˆn2,
...
drN = drN −1 + bN ˆnN dt = drN −1 + dqN ˆnN ,

δr1 = δq1 ˆn1,
δr2 = δr1 + δq2 ˆn2
...
δrN = δrN −1 + δqN ˆnN

As is noted in the previous section for case of double pendulum, due to the holonomic, scleronomous nature of the
constraints, the set of allowed and virtual displacements are equivalent. From the above equations one can see that
the virtual displacement of each pendulum (δrk) is a vector sum of the virtual displacement of the previous pendulum
(δrk−1) and a component along the unit normal ˆnk. Hence the virtual displacements (with the exception of δr1) are
not orthogonal to the corresponding relative position vectors.

Let us now consider the constraint forces on each individual pendulum bob Pk. The bob Pk is pulled towards its
point of suspension (the previous bob Pk−1) by a tension Tk along (rk−1 − rk). The next pendulum bob, Pk+1, is
pulled towards Pk by a tension Tk+1 along (rk − rk+1). In response to this, a reaction force (−Tk+1) acts on the bob
Pk along (rk+1 − rk). Thus between any two neighbouring pendulum bobs, there exists a pair of equal and opposite
action-reaction forces. The total force on Pk is (Tk − Tk+1) for k = 1, 2, . . . , N − 1. However, for the last pendulum
PN , the net constraint force is TN .

The virtual work done by the constraint forces at diﬀerent system points (particle positions) are,

δW1 = R1 · δr1 = (T1 − T2) · δr1 = T1 · δr1 − T2 · δr1
δWk = Rk · δrk = (Tk − Tk+1) · δrk = Tk · (δrk−1 + δqk ˆnk) − Tk+1 · δrk
δWN = RN · δrN = TN · (δrN −1 + δqN ˆnN )

k = 2, . . . , N − 1

(18)

As the strings of the pendulums are ideal, the tension Tk acts along the length of the string, i.e., (rk−1 − rk). Thus

5

(19)

the tension Tk is normal to the unit vector ˆnk. The above virtual work elements become,

δW1 = −T2 · δr1,

δWk = Tk · δrk−1 − Tk+1 · δrk,

δWN = TN · δrN −1.

It is clear that the virtual work at each system point Pk is non-zero. However if we sum the virtual work at all these
system points, we observe a mutual cancellation and the total virtual work vanishes.

. . . . . . + (TN −1 · δrN −2 − TN · δrN −1) + TN · δrN −1 = 0
(20)

This vanishing of total virtual work is a consequence of (i) deﬁnition of virtual displacement, (ii) appearance of
action-reaction pairs in the forces of constraint. The virtual work connected to each bob Pk, is composed of three
parts, (i) virtual work by the tension Tk on the component of virtual displacement δqk ˆnk orthogonal to the relative
position vector, (ii) virtual work by the tension Tk on part of the virtual displacement δrk−1 related to that of the
previous bob, and (iii) virtual work by the reaction tension (−Tk+1) (acting towards the next bob Pk+1) on the
virtual displacement δrk = δrk−1 + δqk ˆnk. The ﬁrst component for each Pk vanishes because of orthogonality of the
related force and virtual displacement. This is shown schematically in ﬁgure 2(b). Due to the “equal and opposite”
nature of action reaction pairs, and existence of a common term in the virtual displacement of neighbouring bobs, the
other terms for each bob cancel with the related terms of its neighbours. Shaded areas in ﬁgure 2(c) illustrate this
cancellation.

Let us now study the N -pendulum when its point of suspension is moving with velocity v0. The system now has a

rheonomous constraint as well,

|r1 − v0t| = L1,

|rk − rk−1| = Lk,

k = 2, 3, . . . , N.

(21)

In accordance with the previous section, for N -pendulum with moving support, the only non-trivial modiﬁcation is
that, the virtual displacements are no longer equivalent with the allowed displacements. For the ﬁrst bob P1,

dr1 = v1 dt = v0 dt + dq1 ˆn1,
δr1 = dr1 − dr′

1 ˆn1) = (dq1 − dq′
Thus δr1 is a vector along ˆn1, whereas dr1 is sum of a vector along ˆn1 and a vector along v0. For subsequent bobs

the previous case of N pendulum with stationary support.

(23)

(24)

δrk = δrk−1 + δqk ˆnk

Hence the above inferences, in particular, (18), (19), (20) are true even for an N -pendulum with moving support.
The adjacent table summarizes the results presented in sections II and III.

IV. CONCLUSION

The zero virtual work principle of d’Alembert’s identiﬁes a special class of constraints, which is available in nature,
and is solvable8. Two noteworthy features of d’Alembert’s principle are, (i) it involves the virtual work (Rk · δrk),
i.e., work done by constraint forces on virtual displacement δrk and not on allowed displacement drk, and (ii) the
total virtual work for the entire system vanishes, i.e., P(Rk · δrk) = 0, though virtual work on individual particles
of the system need not be zero (Rk · δrk) 6= 0. For holonomic (velocity independent) and scleronomous (time
independent) constraints, e.g., pendulum with stationary support, the allowed and virtual displacements are collinear
and hence a distinction between work done on allowed displacement and that on virtual displacement is not possible.
For understanding the nature of this distinction one needs to study a system which is either non-holonomic or
rheonomous. A pendulum with moving support, or a particle sliding down a moving frictionless inclined plane
are examples of simple rheonomous systems. In constrained systems involving a single particle, the second feature
mentioned above, in reference to d’Alembert’s principle, becomes irrelevant. As there is only one particle, there is
no summation in virtual work, and (R · δr) = 0. This implies that the force of constraint R is normal to the virtual
displacement δr. In order to really appreciate the importance of summation in the total virtual work, one needs to
study system of particles involving several constraints. The double pendulum and N -pendulum, particularly with
moving support, present two of the simplest systems illustrating the subtlety of d’Alembert’s principle.

The two-dimensional spin-1 Baxter-Wu model is studied by using Monte Carlo simulations. The
standard single-spin-ﬂip Metropolis algorithm is used to generate the conﬁgurations from which
the order parameter, speciﬁc heat and magnetic susceptibility are measured. The ﬁnite-size scaling
procedure is employed in order to get the critical behavior. The extensive simulations shown that
the critical exponents are diﬀerent from those of the spin-1/2 model suggesting that the spin-1 model
is in a diﬀerent universality class.

INTRODUCTION

The Baxter-Wu model is a system of spins deﬁned on a
two-dimensional triangular lattice with the classical spin
variables si taking only integer values. It was ﬁrst intro-
duced by Wood and Griﬃths [1] as a model which does
not exhibit invariance by a global inversion of all spins.
The system is described by the Hamiltonian

J

sisjsk,

where the coupling constant J is positive and the sum
is over all triangles made up of nearest-neighbor sites on
the triangular lattice. For the spin-1/2 model, where
si =
1, the exact solution obained by Baxter and
Wu gives kBTc/J = 2/ ln(1 + √2) and α = ν = 2
3 [2].
The system has also been studied with quenched impu-
rities by Monte Carlo [3] and Monte Carlo renormaliza-
tion group approaches [4]. Conformal invariance stud-
ies [5, 6] have shown that the pure spin-1/2 Baxter-Wu
and the four-state Potts models have the same opera-
tor content and are in the same universality class. More
recently, the short time critical dynamics has been in-
vestigated through the relaxation of the order parameter
at the critical temperature by Monte Carlo simulations
[7]. On the other hand, for spin values greater or equal
to one there are neither exact solutions nor even much
approximate approaches. It is the purpose of this work
to study the model above for the spin-1 case by using
Monte Carlo simulations, where the variables si take the
values si =

1, 0, 1.

Monte Carlo methods [8, 9] form the largest and most
important class of numerical methods used for solv-
ing statistical physics problems. The basic idea behind
Monte Carlo simulation is to simulate the random ther-
mal ﬂuctuation of the system from state to state over the
course of an experiment. Performing a high-precision
ﬁnite-size scaling analysis using standard Monte Carlo
techniques is very diﬃcult due to constraints on the
available computer resources. The introduction of his-

−

togram techniques to extract the maximum information
from Monte Carlo simulation data at a single temper-
ature enhances the potential resolution of Monte Carlo
methods substantially [10, 11]. In this sense, we apply
the histogram techniques together with the Metropolis
simulation algorithm in order to investigate the thermal
behavior of the spin-1 Baxter-Wu model deﬁned by Eq.
(1) by considering the speciﬁc heat, order parameter and
magnetic susceptibility. Our main interest is to obtain,
through a ﬁnite-size scaling analysis, the phase transi-
tion temperature as well as the critical exponents of the
model.

In the next section we present the thermodynamic
quantities and the details of the simulations. In section
III we discuss the results and in section IV we summarize
our conclusions.

SIMULATION BACKGROUND

≤

The simulations have been carried out by using the
single-spin-ﬂip Metropolis algorithm. In the course of the
simulations we considered triangular lattices with linear
L and fully periodic boundary conditions
dimensions L
×
for system sizes of length 18
108. Due to the fact
that the system has, in addition to the ferromagnetic
phase (with all spins up), three diﬀerent ferrimagnetic
phases with three diﬀerent sublattices (one sublattice up
and spins on the other two sublattices down) the allowed
values of L are always a multiple of 3. In this way, all
ground states of the inﬁnite lattice would ﬁt on any ﬁnite
104
lattice. Following equilibration (which comprised 6
106 MCS (Monte Carlo
MCS) runs comprising up to 5
steps per spin) were performed. Histogram reweighting
[10, 11] and ﬁnite-size scaling techniques were used to
precisely locate the second-order phase transition. Re-
garding the histograms, great care has been taken in or-
der to assure the reliabily of the extrapolated results for
all lattice sizes.

According to ﬁnite-size scaling theory the critical tem-

where λ is a constant, Tc is the critical temperature of
the inﬁnite system, and TL is the eﬀective transition tem-
perature for the lattice of linear size L. This eﬀective
temperature can be given by the position of the maxi-
mum of any of the following quantities: the temperature
derivative of m, ln m or ln m2, the order parameter sus-
ceptibility or the speciﬁc heat. The above temperatures
are given in units of J/kB. An independent estimate of
ν, however, can be made through the evaluation of the
maximum logarithmic derivative of any power of the or-
der parameter mn since one has

RESULTS

The independent evaluation of the critical exponent
ν, as obtained from Eq. (6) without any consideration
of the critical temperature Tc, is shown in Fig. 1 for

2

the maximum derivative of the logarithm of m and m2
(although other powers of m can also be used). From
both cases one has ν = 0.617(4), which is diﬀerent from
ν = 0.666 for the spin-1/2 model.

With ν determined quite accurately we proceed to es-
timate the position of Tc. As discussed in the previous
section, the location of the maxima of the various thermo-
dynamic derivatives, namely the maximum of the speciﬁc
heat, susceptibility, and the derivatives of m and ln m and
ln m2, provide estimates for the transition temperature
which scale with system size as Eq. (5). A plot of these
estimates is given in Fig. 2. The results from the lin-
ear ﬁt are listed in Table I. One can note that they are
indeed quite close to each other and a ﬁnal estimate is
Tc = 1.6607(3).

The logarithm of the maximum value of the speciﬁc
heat and order parameter susceptibility as a function of
the logarithm of L is shown in Fig. 3. From these data
one has α = 0.692(8) and γ = 1.13(1).

2. This is a generalization in the direction of the
D
so-called Blume-Capel model [12]. What we have done
here is studied the special case D = 0. However, in the
limit D
one recovers the spin-1/2 model. From
the present results we then expect that along the second-
order transition line for diﬀerent values of D one has a
line with varying critical exponents. In addition, as we
have shown, a second-order phase transition takes place
at D = 0 in contrast with the conjecture that the spin-1
Baxter-Wu model is critical only in the limit D
→ −∞
[13]. Some preliminary results, agreeing with the picture
of a line of second-order phase transition with varying ex-
ponents and the presence of a multicritical point, for the
present system with crystal ﬁeld interaction, have already
been obtained from conformal invariance with ﬁnite-size
scaling theory and the mean ﬁeld renormalization group
approach [14]. Work in this direction using Monte Carlo
simulations is now in progress.

CONCLUSIONS

It is clear, from the quality of the above results, that
a well deﬁned second order phase transition takes place
in the model at Tc = 1.6607(3) with critical exponents
ν = 0.617(3), α = 0.692(6) and γ = 1.13(1), which are
indeed diﬀerent from the spin-1/2 case, namely ν = 2/3,
α = 2/3 and γ = 7/6. This means that this three spin in-
teraction model has exponents which depend on the spin
value. It is worth saying that the present model can also
have an extra interaction with a crystal ﬁeld of the form

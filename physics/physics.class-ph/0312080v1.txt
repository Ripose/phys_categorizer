Abstract

From the equilibrium condition δS = 0 applied to an isolated thermodynamic system of electri-

cally charged particles and the fundamental equation of thermodynamics (dU = T dS − (f · dr))

subject to a new procedure, it is obtained the Lorentz’s force together with non-inertial terms of

mechanical nature. Other well known ponderomotive forces, like the Stern-Gerlach’s force and a

force term related to the Einstein-de Haas’s eﬀect are also obtained. In addition, a new force term

appears, possibly related to a change in weight when a system of charged particles is accelerated.

INTRODUCTION

There has been an eﬀort to understand macroscopic phenomena, characterized by thermal

equilibrium and irreversible approaches to it, based on the crucially important property: the

entropy. E. T. Jaynes [1] was a precursor of this line of thought. In fact, the application

of information-theoretic techniques to a number of ﬁelds has been very successful, specially

in studying colloidal systems. Interestingly, it was discovered entropy depletion eﬀects in a

binary mixture consisting in the increase of entropy of one component and forcing the other

component to a greater order, leading through this process to the possibility of entropy

control of the directed motion of colloidal particles [2, 3]. Direct measurements of entropic

forces were measured for a single colloidal sphere close to a wall in a suspension of rigid

colloidal rods [4]. Also, stochastic resonance-like phenomena in non-linear systems can

be described by a maximization of the information-theoretic distance measures between

probability distributions of the output variable [5, 6].

In this paper we follow through this line of research of maximum entropy methods, but

proposing a special procedure to analyze systems imparted with general kind of motion,

both translational and rotational. One advantage of this method is that a simple method

of calculation is devised from energy and entropy considerations.

It gives known results

through the use of entropy of a system dynamics and in speciﬁc problems could be a possible

alternative to Hamilton theory. We don’t analyze the eventual deep meaning of the present

procedure, but only claim that the results obtained mean the entropy, as it appears in the

fundamental equations of thermodynamics, could be a mathematical entity useful for the

calculation of non equilibrium processes.

Based on the maximization of entropy principle and the fundamental equation of ther-

modynamics (dU = T dS − (f · dr)), it was previously suggested a new procedure [8] to

obtain the dynamical equation of motion of a particle in a rotating frame.

In this paper we extend the same procedure to classical electrodynamics, obtaining what

we would like to call information-theoretic ponderomotive forces. Besides the classical force

in a rotating frame, it is additionally obtained the Lorentz’s force acting over an electrically

charged particle, the Stern-Gerlach’s force, a term related to the Einstein-de Haas’s eﬀect,

as well a new term, possibly related to a change in weight in an accelerated frame.

II. EXTREMUM PRINCIPLE

Our initial theoretical framework is the one advanced by Landau and Lifshitz [11]. Let

us consider an isolated macroscopic system S composed by N inﬁnitesimal macroscopic
subsystems S′ (with an internal structure possessing a great number of degrees of freedom

to ensure the validity of the entropy concept) with Ei, pi and Ji, all constituted of classical

charged particles with charge qi and mass mi. The system is assumed to be isolated and

so there exist seven independent additives integrals: the energy, 3 components of the linear

momentum p and 3 components of the angular momentum L.

The energetics of the charged particles is modelled on the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of

the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Thus, the internal energy Ui of each subsystem moving with

momentum pi in a Galilean frame of reference is given by

Ei = Ui +

− qiVi + qi(Ai · vi),

their internal energy U, S = S(U)):

The entropy of the system is the sum of the entropy of each subsystems (and function of

In the above equations, ri is the position vector relatively to a ﬁxed frame of reference R,

pi is the total momentum (particle + ﬁeld) and Ji is the total intrinsic angular momentum

of the particle, comprising a vector sum of the electron orbital angular momentum and the

angular momentum contributed by electron spin and nuclear spin (since the electromagnetic

entropy principle introduces Lagrange multipliers from which, as we will see, ponderomotive

forces are obtained.

It is necessary to ﬁnd the conditional extremum; they are set up not for the function S

itself but rather for the changed function ¯S:

where a and b are Lagrange multipliers. The conditional extremum points are obtained for

∂ ¯S
∂r = 0; ∂ ¯S

∂p = 0.

(7)

At thermodynamic equilibrium the total entropy of the body has a maximum constrained

to supplementary conditions 3, 4 and 5.

III. ELECTRODYNAMIC PONDEROMOTIVE FORCES

At this point we intend to go a step further than Landau and Lifschitz presentation [11].

As we are interested in situations in which separate parts of a system (discrete sub-systems)

are internally in equilibrium (this should apply to continuous systems as well) small changes

in extensive coordinates δXµ will produce small deviations δS in the total entropy of the

system. As is known, we can in general deﬁne a set of intensive parameters Fµ in terms of

the local parameter S(Xµ) by the equation

Fµ =

∂S(Xµ)
∂Xµ

(8)

with Fµ being a local position- and time-dependent quantity called the aﬃnity of the sub-

system. After multiplying the aﬃnity by the ”temperature” T it is obtained the entropic

forces. This is what we seek right now and we will show that with an appropriate procedure

electrodynamic ponderomotive (body) forces are obtained. Of course we are aware of the

implications the use of entropy in nonequilibrium can have, but in this paper we don’t analyze

the concept of probability in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Quoting Guttmann [10],

it is sure that this matter is still

ill understood...and don’t have a secure foundation.

Retrospectively, the developments hereby exposed can be an illustration of the potential

use of entropy for others applications than the conventional role played in the determination
of equilibrium states. From the partial derivative, ∂S
∂pi

, it is obtained the total (particle’s +

ﬁeld) canonical momentum (when putting vrel = T a and ω = T b, and thus giving a clear

meaning to the Lagrangian multipliers):

pi = prel + m[ω × ri] + qiAi.

(9)

Here, prel = mvrel is the apparent momentum as seen in a rotating frame R′. As it should

be, besides the mechanical terms related to translation and rotation, it appears the electro-

magnetic momentum term qiAi. By the other hand, a further reﬁnement in the formulation

of the maximum entropy method by postulating the existence of a multiplicative factor T /2
associated to each degree of freedom, allowing us from the partial derivative ∂S

to obtain

mechanical force acting on the ith particle on R frame. The physical meaning of Eq. 11 is

that, at equilibrium, there is no production of entropy and the force acting on over the ith

particle may be found by taking the gradient of a conservative potential (which includes the

rotational energy) - in fact, an eﬀective potential energy, useful in dynamics to ﬁnd turning

points of orbits in a central ﬁeld of force. Remark that the electromagnetic ﬁeld is aﬀected
to U eq

i and that’s why does not appear explicitly here.

Going back to Eq. ref, when considering the ﬂux of the internal energy, through Eq. 2 it

is easy to obtain the following full expression

(12)

It is worth to rearrange some terms in order to give more clear physical meaning to the

all expression. So, using the deﬁnition of B in terms of vector potential, we have the

mathematical identity

∇ri(Ai · vi) = (vi · ∇ri)Ai + (Ai · ∇ri)vi + [vi × Bi] + [Ai × [∇ri × vi]].

(13)

The cross product (vi · ∇)Ai requires an interpretation in physical grounds. In fact, consider

a charge q moving with velocity v along a given direction x, such that it is displaced by

x = vt. The Maxwell equations determine the electromagnetic ﬁeld in terms of the position

of ﬁeld sources relative to the position of the charge, A(x − vt, y, z). It follows, for a planar

wave, a time dependence of the form ∂A
condition ∂S
∂ri

= 0, for example, lead us to the relationship

∂t = −v ∂A

∂x . Taking this into account, the extremum

∇ri(

− ω · Ji) − [Ai × ω],

which is a condition of charges equilibrium in a rotating frame. The ﬁelds are deﬁned as
usually by E = −∇V − ∂A

∂t and B = [∇ × A], with the usual meaning.

In the last ex-

pression, the electromagnetic ﬁeld was computed explicitly and so the equilibrium condition

acquired a new form. In particular, we see that a gyroscopic term plays an important role

in equilibrating the plasma.

In a closed system, the total diﬀerential of U in the variables r and S is given by dU =

T dS − (f · r). During the interval of time dt and at a given point (r, S) together with the

introduction of our postulate, we have the fundamental equation of thermodynamics in a

diﬀerential form:

∇riUi =

∇riS − fi.

(15)

This is the well known fundamental equation of thermodynamics, only diﬀering by the
introduction of a factor T

2 by each degree of freedom. This is a necessary condition in

order to fully exploit all the theoretical predictions which are possible to achieve through

the hereby proposed procedure. In our current perspective, the entropy provides a useful

guide for the likely outcome of a plasma. Through entropy we have access to end-points but

not to the intermediate physical processes that give birth to a ﬁnal state. Thus, applying

6

this equation (same procedure as presented in [8] for Newton’s second law) and after some

vectorial algebra, it is easily obtained the force acting on electrically charged particles

involved, in particular the last term - the gradient of energy in space. It is understandable

that, not far away from equilibrium, we can always assert that

− ∇riUi = −∇riU eq

i + f S.

Here, we denote by f S

i a force term representing a small disturbance of a constant equilibrium

state characterizing ith system. Hence, the above expression can be rewritten in the form

Here, f M

i = qiEi + qi[v×Bi] is the

respective Lorentz’s force. The third term on the right-hand side of the above equation is

the rate of variation of the particle’s velocity along the potential vector acting on it. Now,

notice that Ai =

the charge qi is, as obtained by a development to ﬁrst order in vi of the Li´enard-Wiechert
potentials. This solution corresponds to a retarded potential and is correct only for v

c ≪ 1,
otherwise we should add a relativistic correction. It can be easily shown that the following

relation holds

qi(Ai · ∇ri)vi = −qi[ω × Ai].

To disclose its full physical meaning after a better arrangement, it is easily seen to correspond

to a kind of gyroscopic force

(22)

The third term on the rhs - a kind of gyroscopic force - is unexpected and requires further

study. It can lead to striking new phenomena, such as levitation, because it means that

the interaction between a system of charges with diﬀerent sign leads to a mass increase,

whereas equal sign charged particles when interacting lead to a mass decrease. An eﬀect

similar to some extent to this one was referred by Boyer [9] when investigating the change in

weight associated with the electrostatic potential energy for a system of two point charges

supported side by side against a weak downwards gravitation ﬁeld.

Finally, the fourth term in the rhs is closely related to the Einstein-de Haas eﬀect. In

fact, there is a natural relationship between Ji and the Amp`erian current constituting part
of the material medium and the magnetization vector (in particular, µ = g eJ

2mc ), and from
this result a body force [12]. The ﬁfth term in the rhs is the Stern-Gerlach’s force when

applied to a magnetic moment.

The last term in the rhs, f S

i , was introduced mutatis mutandis to represent non-
equilibrium processes, such as bremsstrahlung radiation, line radiation, turbulence, inter

alia. Altogether, in order to represent fully non equilibrium processes, other terms should

be included, such as the pressure gradients ∇p as well the dissipative terms related to the

momentum gain of the ion ﬂuid caused by collisions with electrons - as admitted in [13],
they are of the form Pei = ηe2n2(ve − vi), where η is the speciﬁc resistivity (in general, a

tensor), but in particular for an isotropic plasma it is a scalar. When searching for a more

complete description, and transposing the equations from the discrete to the continuum

level, the magnetohydrodynamics ﬂuid equations of motion should be retrieved.

We don’t attempt to derive Maxwell equations from the actual framework since they

are essentially relativistic equations obeying Lorentz transformations and a very careful

deﬁnition of time and space should be addressed.

IV. CONCLUSION

This letter has extended the application of a new procedure to electromagnetic ﬁelds.

We believe that the development hereby presented can show up new features related to the

entropy concept itself. It was shown that the inertial force terms appearing in accelerated

frames and the electromagnetic force acting over an electrically charged particle are a man-

ifestation of an entropic force. But if the known forces are obtained with a given kind of

system energy, therefore, working backward we can conclude that a given arrangement of

the system in terms of microstates (and hence through entropy) are generating those forces.

In this sense, as the application of the entropy concept is not well funded in non-equilibrium

situations, we have here possible example of how far we can go. Besides the already know

force terms a kind of new electromagnetic gyroscopic force was shown to appear in a rotating

frame implying a mass variation of a system of charges.

Research of phenomena involving electromagnetic ﬁelds could take advantage of this tool.

Abstract

In this paper we present thoughtful comments on the paper ‘Bessel
beams and signal propagation’ showing that the main claims of that
paper are wrong. Moreover, we take the opportunity to show the non
trivial and indeed surprising result that a scalar pulse (i.e., a wave
train of compact support in the time domain) that is solution of the
homogeneous wave equation ( vector ( ~E, ~B) pulse that is solution of
Maxwell equations) is such that its wave front in some cases does travel
with speed greater than c, the speed of light . In order for a pulse
to posses a front that travels with speed c, an additional condition
must be satisﬁed, namely the pulse must have ﬁnite energy. When
this condition is fulﬁlled the pulse still can show peaks propagating
with superluminal (or subluminal) velocities, but now its wave front
travels at speed c. These results are important because they explain
several experimental results obtained in recent experiments, where
superluminal velocities have been observed, without implying in any
breakdown of the Principle of Relativity.

1

In this paper we present some thoughtful comments (C1 −

C4) concerning
statements presented in the paper
‘Bessel beams and signal propagation’
[1] and also some non trivial results concerning superluminal propagation of
peaks in particular electromagnetic pulses in nondispersive media.

In [1] the author recalls that the experimental results presented in [2]
showed that Bessel beams generated at microwave frequencies have a group
velocity greater than the velocity of light c (in what follows we use units such
that c = 1)1. His intention was then to show that the signal velocity, deﬁned
according to Brillouin and Sommerfeld (B&S) was also superluminal. We
explicitly shows that the particular example used by the author of [1], given
by the Bessel beam of his eq.(3) does not endorse his claim. Contrary to the
author’s conclusion this beam has no fronts in both space and time domains,
hence cannot satisfy B&S deﬁntion of a signal. Moreover, the beam given
by eq.(3) of [1] travels rigidly with a superluminal speed. We prove then
that there are two classes of general Bessel pulses satisfying B&S deﬁnition
of signal. A solution of the HWE corresponding to class I is such that the
group speed is always less than c whereas its front moves with speed c.2 A
solution of the HWE of the class II travels rigidly at superluminal speed if
care is not taken of the energy content of the pulse. We present also some
necessary comments concerning solutions of Maxwell equations associated
with Bessel beams of classes I and II.

We start by recalling the general solution of the HWE (cid:3)Φ = 0 in
Minkowski spacetime (M, η, D) [10-12]. In a given Lorentz reference frame
sec T M, we choose cylindrical coordinates (ρ, ϕ, z) natu-
[10-12] I = ∂/∂t
rally adapted to the I reference frame, where ρ = (x2 + y2)
2 and x = ρ cos ϕ
1In [3] we scrutinized the experimental results of [2]. We presented there a simple
model showing that all particulars of the data (including the slowing of the superluminal
velocity of the peak along the propagation direction) can be qualitatively and quantita-
tively understood as a scissor’s like eﬀect. Moreover in [3] we called the readers attention
that in [4] peaks of ﬁnite aperture approximations (FAA) to particular acoustical Bessel
pulses called X-waves (ﬁrst discoverd by Lu and Greenleaf ([5,6]) have been see to travel
at supersonic speed i.e., with velocity greater than cs , the sound speed parameter ap-
pearing on the homogenous wave equation (HWE). In [4] and [7] it is also predicted the
possibilty of launching FAA to superluminal electromagnetic X-waves, a fact that has
been conﬁrmed experimentally in the microwave region in [2] and in the optical region in
[8]. A review concerning the diﬀerent facets of ‘superluminal’ wave motion under diﬀerent
physical conditions can be found in [9].

The ﬁrst of eqs.(2) is Bessel’s equation, the second one implies that ν must

Minkowski spacetime.3 In what follows ( without loss of generality for the
objectives of the present paper) we choose ν = 0 (and also Ω > 0). Then,

It is quite clear that the wave described by eq.(3), called in [1] a
Bessel beam4, has phase velocity vph = ω/¯k > 1. However, we point out
‘As known, in the absence
that the statement done in [1] is false, namely:
of dispersion the group velocity vgr of a Bessel pulse is equal to the phase
one [4,5]5 since all the components at diﬀerent frequencies propagate with the
same velocity’. To prove its falsity recall that there exists a Lorentz reference

which is moving with velocity vgr = dω/d¯k < 1 in relation to the frame
I in the z-direction. In the coordinates naturally adapted to the frame I ′
the frequency of the wave is ω′ = Ω, which means that in the frame I ′ the
Bessel beam is stationary. This proves our statement that for Bessel beam
the group velocity is always less than the velocity of light c.

C2. Now, we show how to build two diﬀerent classes (I and II) of solutions
of the HWE by appropriate linear superpositions of waves of the form given
by our eq.(3).

Class I. Suppose, following B&S [13,14 ] that a signal is deﬁned as a
pulse with a ﬁnite time duration at the origin z = 0 where a physical de-
vice generated it. We model our problem as a Sommerfeld problem [15] for
the HWE (with cylindrical symmetry), i.e., we want to ﬁnd the solution of
the HWE with the following conditions (called in what follows Sommerfeld
conditions),

the kind of ˜f3 can be build by any physical device. The importance of the
function ˜f3(t, z) is that, as emphasized by B&S [13,14] it shows that we can
associate a group velocity to pulse peaks in general (and of Bessel beams in
particular) satisfying the Sommerfeld conditons (eq.(6)) and that the group

a while the back end of the wave that is travelling at speed c(= 1) will catch

being frequency dependent. The dependency of the beam width on frequency
will cause the beam to have a pulse response that is independent of position.
Indeed, suppose that the source is driven by a frequency distribution B(ω),

on position and consequently modiﬁes the pulse spectrum in such a way to
make the time response of the pulse dependent on radial position. We put an
index X in the wave given by eq.(17) because pulses of this kind have been
named X-waves by Lu and Greenleaf since 1992 [5,6]. Even more, taking
B(ω) = Ae−a0|ω| (A and a0 > 0 being constants), we can easily verify (c.r.,

Eq.(18c) shows that this wave is a real solution of the HWE. We recall that
if in eq.(18a) we use as integration interval 0 < ω <
, we get only the ﬁrst
term in eq.(18b). In this case we have a complex wave that has been called
the broad band X-wave in [4-6]. These waves and the more general ones given
by eq.(18b) propagate without distortion with superluminal velocity given by
1/ cos θ, but of course they cannot be produced in the physical world because
(like the plane wave solutions of the HWE) they have inﬁnity energy, as it
is easy to verify. Waves that are solutions of the linear relativistic wave
equations and that propagate in a distortion free mode, have been called
UPWs (undistorted progressive waves) in [4].

Now, we show that a X-pulse even if it has compact support in the time
domain (thus being of the form of a B&S signal) is such that its front propa-

How to compare this ﬁnding with the famous B&S result [13,14] stating
that a wave pulse which propagates in a dispersive medium with loss has

in order to get a meaningful answer. The ﬁrst is that B&S example refers
to a propagation of a ‘plane’ wave truncated in time (which, of course, has
inﬁnite energy) satisfying the Sommerfeld conditions (analogous to eq.(6))
and propagating in a dispersive medium with loss. A careful analysis [19]
shows that the same problem in a dispersive medium with gain reveals that
in this case we can ﬁnd two kinds of solutions ( both of of inﬁnite energy).
In one of these kinds, by appropriately choosing the integration path in the
complex ω-plane we obtain as result that the front of the wave may travel with
superluminal speed. This situation is somewhat analogous to what happen
with some possible mathematical solutions of the tachyonic Klein-Gordon
equation in two dimensional Minkowski spacetime [20,21]. This equation
is important because it can be associated with the so called telegraphist
equation.

The reason for our ﬁnding that the X-pulse propagating in a nondisper-
sive medium, although of compact support in the time domain, is such that
its front travel at superluminal speed is the following; the solution given by
eq.(20) is not of compact support in the space domain and as such has inﬁnite
energy as can be easily veriﬁed. Only for a pulse of ﬁnite energy we can war-
ranty that its front always travel with a speed that cannot be greater than
maximum speed. Indeed, suppose we produce on the plane z = 0 a pulse like
the one given by eq.(20), except that it has a ﬁnite lateral circular width of
radius a, i.e.,it is taken as zero for ρ > a. Such a pulse is called a FAA to
the pulse given by eq.(20) and as can be easily veriﬁed has ﬁnite energy.
If
such a pulse does not spread with inﬁnite velocity during its build up, then
after it is ready, i.e., at t = T it occupies a region of compact support in
< R, where R is the maximum linear dimension involved.
space given by
Such a ﬁeld conﬁguration can then be taken as part of the initial conditions
for a strictly hyperbolic Cauchy problem at t = T . For such a problem it is
well known the mathematical theorem that stablishes that [22,23] the time
T ). In
evolution of the pulse must be such that it is null for
conclusion, it is not suﬃcient for a wave to be of compact support in the time
domain (i.e., to be a pulse) to assure that the wave front of the pulse moves
in a nondispersive medium at maximum speed c. In order for the wave front
to move with velocity c it is necessary that the pulse possess ﬁnite energy,
and in order for this condition to be satisﬁed the pulse must have compact
support in the space domain after its build up. We recall here that in [4] the
peaks of FAA to acoustical pulses given by eq.(18) (with appropriated B(ω))
have been seen traveling with velocities cs/ cos θ, thus conﬁrming the theory

C3. We now examine the claim of [1] that a wave given by our eq.(17),

U(t, ρ, z) =

dωJ0(ωρ sin θ)e−i(ωt−kz cos θ), ω = k.

(21)

is a pulse with support only in the z-axis at points z = t/ cos θ and with value
at that points δ(0). The calculations presented in [1] are wrong. Before we
‘a signal can be
prove our statement let us recall that [1] quotes Brillouin:
deﬁned as a pulse of ﬁnite temporal extension, that is, of inﬁnite extension in
the frequecy domain’.8 The wave given by eq.(21) has an inﬁnite extension
in the frequency domain but it is not a pulse of ﬁnite time domain (for a
ﬁxed z). Indeed, as theorem 11 on page 22 in Sneddon’s book [24] stablishes:
a function which is bounded in the time domain has an inﬁnite extension
in the frequency domain, but it is not true that a function with an inﬁnite
frequency spectrum is necessarily bounded in the time domain. A trivial
example of the last statement is the case of a Gaussian pulse, whose Fourier
transform is itself a Gaussian. In the particular case of the wave given by
eq.(21) it is immediate to realize that the integral is nothing more than the
Fourier transform of a J0 function, and the value of the integral is given in
many books, in particular on page 523 of Sneddon’s book [24]. We have,

C4. Finally, we investigate the claim (done in [1] and attributed to [8])
that the wave function given by eq.(3) represents an electric ﬁeld. This claim
is a nonsequitur. Indeed,
the scalar solutions of the HWE can be used to
generated solutions of the Maxwell system using the Hertz potential method
(see, e.g.[25,26]). In particular, superluminal solutions of the HWE can be
used to produce superluminal solutions of Maxwell equations [4,7,9]. If we
choose a magnetic Hertz potential ~Πm = ΦJ0 ˆz it is a simple exercise to show
that the transverse electric and magnetic ﬁelds do not show any dependence
on J0. Only the Bz component of the electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration has
a J0 dependence, but has also two other terms showing a J1 and a J2 depen-

With an electric Hertz potential we obtain a solution where only the Ez
component has a J0 dependence. As such, we conclude that the electromag-
netic beams observed in [2] and also in [8,17] are not J0 beams. A careful
analysis of the solutions of Maxwell equations in cylindrical symmetry shows
that there are not J0 solutions representing transverse electric ﬁelds. The
existence of only one peak observerd in the experiments done in [2] must
be due to the J1/ρ term in Eϕ. A more detailed analysis will be reported
elsewhere.

Our conclusions are as follows: (i) our results show that the main claims
of [1] are wrong and/or misleading and leads to equivocated conclusions con-
cerning recent experimental results showing superluminal motion of peaks
of particular electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations in nondispersive media; (ii)
we also prove a non trivial result, namely that the condition that a wave is
of ﬁnite time duration is not a suﬃcient condition for its front to propagate
with the speed c. It is necessary in order for the front to travel with speed c
that the pulse possess ﬁnite energy, and thus as explained above it must (af-
ter being prepared by the launching device) have support only in a compact

11

space region when ready;9 (iii) only FAA to superluminal solutions of the
HWE (acoustical case) and to superluminal solutions of Maxwell equations
can be produced in nature, because only waves of this kind have ﬁnite en-
ergy. These FAA exhibit peaks propagating with superluminal speeds even
in the vacuum, but since their fronts propagate with speed c this kind of
phenomenom does not implies in any danger for the Theory of Relativity.

9We mention here that any electromagnetic pulse fulﬁlling this condition spreads, a

result that may be called the non focusing theorem [27].

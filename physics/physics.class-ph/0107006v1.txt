Abstract

A fundamentally new understanding of the classical electromagnetic inter-
action of a point charge and a magnetic dipole moment through order v2/c2
is suggested. This relativistic analysis connects together hidden momentum
in magnets, Solem’s strange polarization of the classical hydrogen atom, and
the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift. First we review the predictions following
from the traditional particle-on-a-frictionless-rigid-ring model for a magnetic
moment. This model, which is not rela tivistic to order v2/c2, does reveal a
connection between the electric ﬁeld of the point charge and hidden momen-
tum in the magnetic moment; however, the electric ﬁeld back at the point
charge due to the Faraday-induced changing magnetic moment is of order
1/c4 and hence is negligible in a 1/c2 analysis. Next we use a relativistic
magnetic moment model consisting of many superimposed classical hydrogen
atoms (and anti-atoms) interacting through the Darwin Lagrangian with an
external charge but not with each other. The analysis of Solem regarding the
strange polarization of the classical hydrogen atom is seen to give a fundamen-
tally diﬀerent mechanism for the electric ﬁeld of the passing charge to change
the magnetic moment. The changing magnetic moment leads to an electric
force back at the point charge which i)is of order 1/c2, ii)depends upon the
magnetic dipole moment, changing sign with the dipole moment, iii) is odd in
the charge q of the passing charge, and i v) reverses sign for charges passing
on opposite sides of the magnetic moment. Using the insight gained from this
relativistic model and the analogy of a point charge outside a conductor, we
suggest that a realistic multi-particle magnetic moment in volves a changing
magnetic moment which keeps the electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum constant.
This means also that the magnetic moment does not allow a signiﬁcant shift
in its internal center of energy. This criterion also implies that the Lorentz fo
rces on the charged particle and on the point charge are equal and opposite
and that the center of energy of each moves according to Newton’s second law
F = M a where F is exactly the Lorentz force. Finally, we note that the results
and suggestion given here are precisely what are needed to explain both the
Aharonov-Bohm phase shift and the Aharonov-Casher phase shift as arising

1

from classical electromagnetic forces. Such an explanation reinstates the tra-
ditional se miclassical connection between classical and quantum phenomena
for magnetic moment systems.

1. INTRODUCTION
a) A New Ingredient Missing from Previous Work

The classical electromagnetic interaction of a point charge and a magnetic dipole moment
is a poorly understood aspect of classical physics. However, our understanding of this
interaction is important in interpreting several famous experi ments and is inﬂuential in
assessing the connections between classical and quantum physics. Indeed, it turns out that
one of the crucial ingredients for understanding this interaction has been missing from both
the instructional and research litera ture. Although a role for the electrostatic ﬁeld of the
passing charge has been explored in connection with both electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum
and hidden particle momentum in magnets,[1] the role of the electric ﬁeld in changing the
magnetic mome nt and so in providing an electric force back on the passing charge has
been completely missed.
In this article we will discuss the interaction of a point charge
and a magnetic dipole moment, noting the inadequacy of previous models, emphasizing the
previously unrecognized aspects in a relativistic model, and suggesting that the realistic
interaction of a point charge and a magnet reinstates both Newton’s second and third laws
involving the Lorentz force.
b) Importance of Understanding the Interaction

The interaction of a magnetic moment and a point charge seems like such a basic element
within classical physics that one would expect it to be discussed in the electromagnetism
textbooks. However, this is not the case. Although many texts discuss the magnetic inter-
action between current loops (and by extension between magnetic dipole moments), there
seems to be no discussion of the subject of this article. However, the teaching and research
literature is full of discussions of and paradoxes involving magnetic moments and point
charges. The Shockly-James paradox[2,3] appears in the research literature while contro-
versy regarding magnetic moments and electromagnetic ﬁelds is a staple of the American
Journal of Physics.[4] Ind eed, in trying to understand the interaction of a magnetic moment
and a point charge, various authors have introduced new equations of motion for magnetic
moments which depart from Newton’s second law involving the Lorentz force.[5] The in-
teraction of a magnetic moment and a point charge is at the heart of the experimentally
observed Aharonov-Bohm[6,7] and Aharonov-Casher[8,9] phase shifts. Because of our poor
understanding of the classical electromagnetic interactions involved, these experime nts have
been interpreted as revealing a new quantum topological eﬀect representing a new departure
between classical and quantum theories of physics. Thus our understanding of the classi-
cal electromagnetic interaction of a magnetic moment and a po int charge inﬂuences our
interpretation both of experiments and of fundamental aspects of physical theory.
c) Outline of the Discussion

This article is organized so as to begin with familiar aspects of magnetic moments and
then to include the unexpected elements. Thus we begin with two current loops and note
the requirement that the currents (and hence the magnetic moments) are forced to change
if there are no batteries in the circuits when the circuits are displaced relative to each other.
Next we turn to the interaction of a point charge and a magnetic moment, discussing the
basic electromagnetic forces and pointing out that the forces depend upon any changes
in the magnetic moment. We then look at two speciﬁc models in order to determine the
crucial magnetic moment change. First we treat the traditional, not-relativistic model of
a charge sliding on a frictionl ess rigid ring, and we conclude that there is no signiﬁcant

3

change in the magnetic moment and therefore no signiﬁcant electric ﬁeld arising due to
the magnetic moment. Second we discuss a relativistic (to order 1/c2) model based upon
a hydroge n-atom magnetic moment described by the Darwin Lagrangian.
In this case,
Solem’s[10 ] observation regarding the ”strange polarization of the classical atom” leads
to an entirely unanticipated change in the magnetic moment, which leads to signiﬁcant
electric ﬁelds acting on the passing charged particle. We then look at the relativistic motion
of the center of mass of the magnetic moment and note that this depends crucially upon
the change of the magnetic moment. Working by analogy with the b ehavior of a point
charge outside a conductor and our results from the relativistic magnetic moment model,
we suggest that the magnetic moment will change in just such a way as to prevent energy
ﬂow within the magnetic moment, keep a constant electr omagnetic linear momentum for
the electromagnetic ﬁeld, cause the traditional Newton’s second law for the motion of the
magnetic moment connected to the Lorentz force, and maintain the validity of Newton’s third
law for the Lorentz forces between th e point charge and the magnetic moment. Finally,
we note that the proposed behavior of the magnetic moment would give a classical force-
based explanation of the Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher phase shifts. The proposed
behavior would eliminate t he quantum topological Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect as the explanation
of these phase shifts, and would restore the traditional connection between classical and
quantum physics for magnetic moment systems.
2. FAMILIAR PRELIMINARY: THE INTERACTION OF TWO MAGNETIC
MOMENTS
a) Magnetic Moments in Electromagnetism Texts

Although the interaction of a point charge with a magnetic moment does not appear in
the textbooks, the magnetic moment interaction which does appear is that of two current
loops with steady currents. In the limit of small current loops, we can think of the interaction
as involving two magnetic moments. In this case the results are familiar and reassuring. The
magnetic Lorentz forces of one circuit on the other satify Newton’s third law, giving forces
of equal magnitude and opposite direction.[11] In the limit of current loops which are small
compared to their separation, we can write the magnetic forces as [12]

Fon1 = ∇1[m1 · B2(r1, t)] = ∇1[m1 · ∇1 × A2(r1, t)]

= ∇1

m1 ·

∇1 ×

 

(

m2 × (r1 − r2)

|r2 − r1|3

"

#)!

= −∇2[m2 · ∇2 × A1(r2, t)] = −∇2[m2 · B1(r2, t)] = −Fon2

(1)

Here there is no electrostatic ﬁeld present, and hence no linear momentum in the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld. In this case we expect the validity of Newton’s second law for the motion of
the center of energy of each magnetic moment
b) Energy Considerations and Changing Magnetic Moments

Although the magnetic forces between two magnetic dipole moments reassuringly satisfy
Newton’s third law, just as do the forces in electrostatics, the energy considerations are
emphatically and disconcertingly diﬀerent from the electrostat ic situation. Here we are
reminded that magnetic moments involve hidden aspects which are unfamiliar from our

4

experience with electrostatics.
quasistatically displaced, then there is net me chanical work done associated with the net
Lorentz force on the circuit; however, there is, of necessity, other work involved. There is
work associated with the currents of the magnetic moments moving in the emfs induced
by the relative movement of the circuits. If any batteries in the circuits hold the currents
constant, then the work done by each battery is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to
the mechanical work done in displacing one of the circuits.[13] In the case of small circuit s
which can be regarded as magnetic moments, we have

δWbattery = IδΦ = −δWmechanical

(2)

When there are no batteries present, then the internal energy of each magnetic moment will
change because of the work done by the emf acting on the currents. This energy change is
a hidden aspect of a magnetic moment.

For toy magnets we use F = Ma where F is calculated as the Lorentz force between
current loops in (1) above and a is the acceleration of the center of energy of the magnet.
When the magnets are modeled a s current loops, then the energies U of the magnets change,
but these energy changes are of order 1/c2, giving mass changes M = U/c2 of order 1/c4,
and so do not aﬀect the acceleration through order 1/c2.
3. PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION OF THE INTERACTION OF A POINT
CHARGE AND A MAGNETIC MOMENT
a) The Lorentz Forces and Electromagnetic Field Momentum

In the analysis of the present article, we are interested in relativistic eﬀects through order
1/c2. This corresponds to the quasistatic approximation to classical electromagnetic theory.
In this quasistatic approximation the ﬁelds d ue to a magnetic moment at a ﬁxed position
rm can be described in terms of a vanishing scalar potential Φm(r, t) and a magnetic vector
potential Am(r, t) of a magnetic moment,[14]

Φm(r, t) = 0, Am(r, t) = m(t) ×

(r − rm)

In this same quasistatic approximation, the ﬁelds due to a point charge can be described

Thus when a point charge is located near a magnetic moment, these electromagnetic
distributions interact through their electromagnetic ﬁelds producing a Lorentz force on the
magnetic moment m given by[16]

(10)

In general these forces are not equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, in contrast
to the situation which held in the case of two interacting magnetic moments. Now if the
forces do not satisfy Newton’s third law, then conservation of linear m omentum requires
the presence of some additional momentum; in this case the additional linear momentum is
located in the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Indeed, the presence of the electric ﬁeld of the point
charge q leads to an electromagnetic ﬁeld linear momentum[17]

a vector identity. We notice that the two Lorent z forces satisfy Newton’s third law if and
only if the linear momentum in the electromagnetic ﬁeld does not change in time

Pem = 0

(13)

However, the constancy of Pem depends upon the time rate of change of the magnetic
moment, dm/dt. Later we will suggest that the magnetic moment actually changes in just
such a way as to keep Pem constant so th at the Lorentz forces between the point charge
and the magnetic dipole moment indeed satisfy Newton’s third law.
b) Constant Motion of the Center of Energy

In addition to conservation of linear momentum, relativistic theories also require uniform
motion of the system center of energy.[1] Now within nonrelativistic physics, the statement
of conservation of linear momentum is the same as the stateme nt of uniform motion of the
center of mass; within relativistic physics, the statements are diﬀerent. Thus if we identify
the mass Mm of the magnetic moment as its relativistic energy Um divided by c2, then (since
the magnetic ﬁeld energy is already of order 1/c2) we require[18]

Mmam + Mqaq = 0

(14)

However, this equation is not easily reconciled with equation (12) for forces satisfying New-
ton’s second law, unless the condition of Eq.(13) actually holds.

Indeed, because of these relativisitic complications, Aharonov, Pearl, and Vaidman,[19]
along with others [20], have introduced a equation of motion for the magnetic moment
which is diﬀerent from Newton’s F = Ma where F is the Lorentz force. In order to gain an
understanding of these matters, we must determine dm/dt. This is a crucial element in the
analysis. However, in order to do this, it is not suﬃcient to work from the prescribed charge
and current distributions for magnetic moments which appear in the text books. Rather
we must turn to speciﬁc models for the behavior of the magnetic moment. In this article,
we will look at two diﬀerent models for magnetic moment behavior which lea d to vastly
diﬀerent results for dm/dt.
4. THE PARTICLE-ON-A-RIGID-RING MODEL FOR A MAGNETIC MO-
MENT
a) The Model

The model for a magnetic dipole moment which appears frequently in both the teaching
and and research literature is that of one or more charged particles eb sliding around a small,
rigid, frictionless, circular ring. The masses mb of the moving charges are taken as small
while the mass of the circular ring is large, and the circular ring has at its center a charge
which is opposite from that of the moving charges. The magnetic dipole moment is given as

m =

rb × vb =

eb
2c

Xb

k

eb
2c

R2ωb

Xb

(15)

where the sum is over all the moving charges eb moving with velocity vb, and here we have
chosen the ring to lie in the plane z = 0 and the particle speeds vb = Rωb. The use of a
single charge eb makes the calculations easie st. By appropriately stacking these circular
magnetic-moment loops, we can form a solenoid or a toroid.

7

The electromagnetic ﬁelds caused by the model and the Lorentz forces experienced by the
model, when averaged over the circular motion, are taken as those of the magnetic moment.
The motion of the charge eb is circular

rb = R[icos(θb) + jsin(θb)]

vb = Rωb[−isin(θb) + jcos(θb)]

ab = −Rω2

b [icos(θb) + jsin(θb)] + Rαb[−isin(θb) + jcos(θb)]

where we have taken the center of the circular loop as the origin of coordinates and have
written ωb = dθb/dt, αb = dωb/dt. For the unperturbed motion, αb = 0.
b) The Lorentz Forces

It is easy to calculate the average Lorentz forces between the model magnetic moment
m and a passing charge q. To obtain the force on the charge q, we evaluate the average
electric and magnetic ﬁelds due to the magnetic moment . The ﬁelds follow from the
average electromagnetic potentials. The magnetic vector potential Am(r, t) produced by
the circulating charge eb at a ﬁeld point r, when averaged over the steady-state motion (16)
in t he limit R << r is just[21]

just as in Eq.(3) for the vector potential of a magnetic moment located at the origin of

the magnetic ﬁeld of a magnetic dipole m centered on the origin of coordinates. The electric
potential, when averaged over the steady-state motion in the limit R << r, gives

We note that the overall distribution is neutral and the rotating electric dipole vanishes
when averaged over the steady-state motion. There remains the electric ﬁeld from the
average electric quadrupole moment, but this is not of interest since it reverses sign when
both the charge eb and the angular velocity ωb = vb/R are reversed in sign so as to maintain
the sign of the magnetic dipole moment. Thus, ignoring the electric quadrupole term, the
electric ﬁeld of the model gives acc ordingly

(22)

The Lorentz force Fonq on the passing charge q due to the model magnetic moment is exactly
as in Eq.(10)

The Lorentz force experienced by the magnetic moment is found from the Lorentz force

on the circulating charge when averaged over the orbit for R << r,

Fonm =

(23)

vb
c

Now the ﬁrst term on the second line of Eq.(23)can be neglected as the force on the electrical
quadrupole moment (which vanishes under the magnetic-moment preserving sign-reversal
of both eb and ω), and the term involving ebvb vanishes when averaged over the steady-
state motion. The term involving ebvbrb can be transformed using tenor notation when we
note that the average < xixj > is time-independent for a steady-state motion and so that
d < xixj > /dt =< xivj + vixj >= 0, and also note that ∇ · B = ∂iBi = 0. Thus we have

(cid:29)

(cid:29)

=< (1/2)ǫkpqxpvq∂iBk >=< {∇[(1/2)(r × v) · B]}i >

(24)

where ∇ acts on the argument of B and not on the (r × v) which should actually have
b-subscripts. Accordingly, we have our required result

9

Fonm = ∇[m · Bq(r, t)]r=0

(25)

where the magnetic moment is as given in Eq.(15). This agrees with the force given in
Eq.(9).

The linear momentum in the electromagnetic ﬁeld can be obtained from the usual ex-

pression involving point charges,[22] again averaging over the steady-state orbit,

electromagnetic ﬁeld agrees with the general result given earlier in Eq.(11).
c) The Electric Field Back at the Point Charge in this Model

2x2

We have just seen that our particle-on-a-rigid-ring model for a magnetic moment indeed
satisﬁes the requirements for the electromagnetic ﬁelds and forces of a general magnetic
moment given in Section 3. Thus it is of interest to determine wh at this model gives for
the time rate of change of the magnetic moment dm/dt due to a passing charge q, and so to
determine the electric ﬁeld due to the magnetic moment which acts on the passing charge
q. The magnetic moment m = (eb/2c) < rb × vb > is proportional to the nonrelativistic
particle angular momentum L with the familiar factor eb/2Mbc,

m =

< rb × vb >=

< rb × (Mbvb) >=

(28)

eb
2c

eb
2Mbc

L

Thus the rate of change of the magnetic moment dm/dt is proportional to the rate of change
of the particle angular momentum dL/dt and proportional to the torque.

10

In this model, the electrostatic part of the electric ﬁeld Eq of the passing charge is essen-
tially uniform across the small magnetic moment; the electrostatic part causes the charge
eb of the magnetic moment to accelerate symetri cally on opposite sides of the frictionless
rigid ring and provides no average torque. Thus the electrostatic ﬁeld does not change the
magnitude of the magnetic moment m. However, the magnetic ﬁeld of the passing charge
q does induce an emf in the magnetic moment orbit which will lead to a change dm/dt in
the magnetic moment m and hence to an electric ﬁeld and force back at the passing charge
q /c2
q. (The part of the electric ﬁeld corresponding to the induc ed emf appears in the v2
terms in the electric ﬁeld expression (7).) The induced emf in the rigid current loop in the

We notice that this induced electric ﬁeld back at the position of the passing charge q
i) is of order e2q2 and therefore does not change sign with q, ii) does not depend upon the
velocity of the charge eb and therefore does not depend upon the magnitude or direction of
the magnetic moment, and iii) is of order 1/c4 and hence is completely negligible compared
to the magnetic Lorentz forces of order 1/c2.
[23] Thus according to this model, the force
on the passing charge ar ises solely from the magnetic ﬁeld due to the magnetic moment.
d) The Hidden Momentum

Although the rigid-ring model does not suggest the existence of any signiﬁcant electric
force back on the passing charge q, it does suggest the possiblity of hidden momentum in
the magnetic moment. This hidden momentum is easy to calcul ate in the rigid-ring model
and now appears in electromagnetism textbooks.[24] The circular motion of the charge eb in
the electrostatic ﬁeld of the passing charge involves a periodic change in the nonrelativistic
kinetic energy as the charge mo ves around the rigid ring; energy conservation gives

11

(1/2)Mbv2

b + ebV = (1/2)Mbv2
b0

(33)

where V = qrb · rq/r3
q is the changing part of the electrostatic potential of the point charge
q when evaluated at the position rb = R(icosωt + jsinωt) of the circulating charge eb, and
(1/2)Mbv2
b0 is the kinetic energy of the circulating charge before the arrival of the passing
charge q. Clearly the electrostatic potential is as often positive as negative and so the average
energy of the circulating charge eb is s till the (1/2)Mbv2
b0 which held before the arrival of q.
However, in this rigid-ring model, the linear momentum has acquired a new average value

e) New Proposed Equation of Motion

Since we have aready seen that in this rigid-ring model the change in the magnetic
moment dm/dt is negligible (as order 1/c2 and leading to electric ﬁelds of order 1/c4), it
has been suggested[19] that part of the magnetic Lore ntz force (25) acting on the magnetic
moment goes simply into changing this ”hidden momentum” and thus the center of energy
of the magnetic moment accelerates according to

Mmam = Fonm −

(35)

This is a strange equation of motion where Newton’s second law no longer connects the
acceleration of a mass to a force given by the Lorentz force Fonm. However, this equation of
motion for a magnetic moment or a magnet has been accept ed by numbers of physicists.
5. A RELATIVISTIC MODEL FOR A MAGNETIC MOMENT
a) The Model

In theoretical physics we have the greatest conﬁdence when our results are model-
independent. In the previous section, we evaluated the interaction of a point charge and a
magnetic dipole moment using the charge-on-a-rigid-ring model for the m agnetic moment.
This model, although thoroughly familiar and easy to work with, is not relativistic to order
v2/c2. The nonrelativisitic character is immediately betrayed by the rigid quality of the
ring. Furthermore, this model violates the r elativistic requirement of uniform motion of
the center of energy since it involves the continual transfer of energy from one side of the
ring to the other without any compensating shift in the system center of energy. Thus we
turn next to a relativ isitic model for the magnetic moment in order to check whether our
previous conclusions are still valid in a diﬀerent model.

12

The Darwin Lagrangian, which is relativistic through order 1/c2, is known to represent
the classical electromagnetic interaction between charged particles through order 1/c2.[26]
Thus for a relativistic magnetic moment model, we will choo se not a circulating charge eb
on a rigid ring, but rather a charge eb in a circular Coulomb orbit around a much heavier
nucleus of charge eb′ = −eb. This hydrogen-atom system with a circular orbit has a time-
average magnetic dipole moment which is the same as that of a charge sliding on a rigid,
circular, frictionless ring, provided the charge eb, radius R, and angular frequency ω are
the same. Further, we imagine that the magnetic dipole moment consists of a superposi
tion of non-interacting hydrogen atoms (and anti-atoms with opposite angular velocity ω)
so as to eliminate all electrostatic multipole moments while maintaining the magnetic dipole
moment. In our model, the external charge q interacts thro ugh the Darwin Lagrangian with
each of the atoms which make up the magnetic moment, but none of the atoms interact with
other atoms.

If the unperturbed orbits are the same, we see immediately that our calculations for
the average magnetic Lorentz forces between the magnetic moment and an external charge
q are identical to those obtained in the previous section using the rig id-ring model for
a magnetic moment. The same agreement holds for the electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum
involving the magnetic moment and the point charge. The calculations of these quantities
depended simply upon the stationary nature of the average currents of the magnetic dipole
in the absence of any interaction between the point charge and the magnetic moment.
b) New Behavior:Solem’s Strange Polarization of the Classical Hydrogen Atom
Although the magnetic Lorentz forces and the electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum depend
only upon the average stationary character of the magnetic moment currents, the time
derivative of the magnetic moment dm/dt and the hidden momentum b oth depend cru-
cially upon the velocity changes of the charged particles which produce the magnetic mo-
ment. Thus when we calculated these quantities in the previous section, we made use of the
explicit form for these magnetic-moment currents as arisi ng from charges moving around a
frictionless circular ring.

In 1987 Solem[10] pointed out in the American Jounal of Physics that the response of
a classical hydrogen atom to an external electric ﬁeld was completely diﬀerent from the
polarization expected of an isotropic harmonic oscillator. Whereas t he familiar textbook
model of atomic polarization (given by the harmonic oscillator) predicts a polarization in
the direction of the external electric ﬁeld, the response of a classical hyrogen is ”strange;”
the hydrogen atom begins by giving a polar ization perpendicular to the direction of the
applied electric ﬁeld. Furthermore, the external electric ﬁeld leads to a change dL/dt in the
angular momentum of the orbiting particle. Solem’s observation is the crucial beginning
step in understanding the interaction of a point charge and a relativistic magnetic dipole
moment.
c) The Changing Magnetic Moment

Our relativistic (to order 1/c2) model for a magnetic moment consists of noninteracting
classical hydrogen atoms. The external point charge q is regarded as moving with velocity
vq past the magnetic moment. We think of the hyd rogen atoms as undergoing many orbital
revolutions during the passage of the point charge and also regard each system as providing
only a small perturbation on the other. The passing charge is regarded as suﬃciently far
from the magnetic moment th at the electrostatic ﬁeld of the charge can be taken as uniform

13

across the magnetic moment. Thus the situation corresponds to that discussed in Solem’s
analysis.[10]

The acceleration of a nonrelativistic electron in a classical hydrogen atom in a uniform
external electric ﬁeld E0 is given by Newton’s second law with a force of Coulomb attraction
to the nucleus and a force ebE0 due t o the external ﬁeld

Mb

dt2 = −

(36)

As noted above, the rate of change of the magnetic moment of the classical hydrogen atom
is proportional to the rate of change of the angular momentum of the charge eb in its orbit
around the heavy nucleus. The rate of change of angular momentum is proportional to the
torque Γb applied to the circulating charge by the electric ﬁeld, Γb = rb × Fb = rb × ebE0.

(37)

Now the initial motion of the circulating charge eb is a circular orbit so that the average
displacement of the charge from the nucleus vanishes < rb >= 0. In the rigid-circular-ring
model of the previous section all the velocity ch anges are symmetric on the opposite sides
of the ring perpendicular to E0 and the quantity < rb > ×E0 remains zero despite the
presence of the external electric ﬁeld. However, for the magnetic moment model of the
classical hydrogen atoms, Solem’s work tell us that this average displacement changes due
to the applied electric ﬁeld and < rb > ×E0 becomes non-zero.[27]

For a charged particle e in a Coulomb orbit, the displacement from the origin can be

written in the form

M(r × v) × r + Mvr2
(cid:16)
where K is the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector[28]

and H0 is the particle energy

Equation (38) can be veriﬁed by simply carrying out the time derivative appearing there,
and then inserting the equation of motion a = −e2r/(Mr3) for every appearance of the
acceleration a = d2r/dt2. The Lapl ace-Runge-Lenz vector is constant in time for a Coulomb
orbit, and the second term in Eq.(38) involving a time derivative shows how the displacement
r varies in time; on averaging, the time-derivative term vanishes giving

In our model, the rate of change of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector due to the uniform
ﬁeld E is given by time-diﬀerentiation on the left- and right-hand sides of the deﬁnition
Eq.(39) and the use of the equation of motion (36),

(42)

This equation reminds us that the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector is time-independent for a
Coulomb orbit in the absence of the external electric ﬁeld Eq = 0, but does indeed change due
to an external electric ﬁeld. Now in our model for a rela tivistic magnetic moment involving
classical hydrogen atoms, we are interested in orbits which are slightly perturbed by the
electrostatic ﬁeld of the passing point charge. Thus through ﬁrst order in the perturbing
ﬁeld E, we can obtai n the time derivative of K in Eq.(42) by using the unperturbed steady-
state orbit on the right-hand side. For this steady-state motion, the average over the orbit
gives < xivj + vixj >= 0 or < xivj >= − < vixj >= (1/2) < xivj − vixj > and < r · v >= 0.
Thus the time-derivative of K in Eq.(42), when averaged over the orbital motion, can be
rewritten using the same techniques for steady-state motions which we used earlier to ﬁnd

d) The New Electric Force Back on the Passing Charge

Now in our model for a relativistic magnetic moment involving classical hydrogen atoms,
we are interested in orbits which begin as circular, but then are slightly perturbed by the
electrostatic ﬁeld of the passing point charge. Initially, when the point charge is far away, a
circular orbit of the magnetic moment has < rb >= 0, corresponding to a vanishing Laplace-
Runge-Lenz vector K. However, the electrostatic ﬁeld causes a change in K, which gives a
non- zero value for < rb >, which then produces a torque on the orbit due to the electrostatic
ﬁeld of the passing charge, which then leads to a change of the magnetic moment, and so
an electric ﬁeld back at the position of the passing charge. Thus combining equations (4),
(37), (41), (42), and noting that the electric ﬁeld at the magnetic moment due to the charge
q is Eq(rm, t)rm=0 = q(−nq)/r2
q where rq = nqrq is the di splacement of the charge q from
the magnetic moment m at the origin, the electric force on the passing charge q due to the
changing magnetic moment is

As a speciﬁc example of this eﬀect, we consider a point charge q moving with (unper-

moment located at the origin and oriented in the z-direction m = km. Then according to

where in the last line we have used y = V t. We notice that the y-component of the force (45)
reverses sign with the sign of the x-coordinate d, and hence is opposite for charges passing
on opposite sides of the magnetic moment. This suggests a cl assical electromagnetic lag
eﬀect: particles which start out side-by-side will no longer be side-by-side after they pass on
opposite sides of a magnetic moment.[29]

We see that the electric force back on the passing point charge q due to the magnetic
moment is totally diﬀerent from that suggested by the rigid-ring model. Here in this rela-
tivistic model we ﬁnd that the electric force on q is i) odd in the charge q and so reverses
sign with q, ii)depends upon the magnetic moment m and reverses sign when m reverses
sign, iii)is of order 1/c2 since in Gaussian units m is of order 1/c, and iv) the y-component of
the force changes directions for charges passing on opposite sides of the magnetic moment.
e) Motion of the Center of Energy of the Magnetic Moment

There have been several attempts to introduce equations of motion for magnetic mo-
ments which seem to depart from the familiar Newton’s second law with the force given by
the Lorentz force. Indeed, there is considerable confusion over the term ” force” and the
designation of just what is accelerating when dealing with relativistic systems.[30] In the
previous section we saw that our relativistic model for a magnetic moment gave a Lorentz
force back on a passing charge which is completely di ﬀerent from that suggested by the
traditional rigid-ring model. In the present section we analyze the motion of the magnetic

16

moment from a relativistic point of view. Again we emphasize that the possiblity that the
magnetic moment may change in ti me is crucial in treating both the forces due to the
magnetic moment and the motion of the magnetic moment itself.

Our relativistic model for the magnetic moment is that of noninteracting hydrogen atoms

which interact with the external charge through the Darwin Lagrangian[1,26]

The ﬁrst two terms involving the mass Ma represent the expansion of the usual free-particle

a spatial integral over E2 − B2. Speciﬁcally, the second group of terms involving eaeb is the
E2dV and the last group of terms invoving eaebvavb corresponds
electrostatic energy 1/(8π)

where r = nr is the displacement of the ﬁeld point from the charge e, v is the charge velocity,
and a the acceleration. These ﬁeld expressions from the Darwin Lagrangian correspond
with those used by Page and Adams[17] which follow from the usual expressions for the
electromagnetic ﬁelds of a point charge[32] when expanded through order 1/c2.

The Lorentz force on the magnetic moment is taken as the sum of the Lorentz forces on
the individual charges eb and e′
b of the magnetic moment. We emphasize that when we refer
to a ”force” in this article, we are always referring to a Lor entz force or the sum of Lorentz
forces. However, other authors use the term ”force” to refer to other quantities.[1]

Although we are thinking of a relativistic magnetic moment model which involves the
superposition of many hydrogen atoms (and antiatoms), we will describe the interaction as
though it involved exactly three particles. The charge eb of mass Mb is in a Coulomb orbit

around the heavy nucleus of charge eb′ = −eb and mass Mb′ while the charge q passes at a

moment particles, we can discus s the energy, linear momentum, and velocity of the center
of energy for the magnetic moment system, the passing charge q, and the total system
composed of both parts. The energy Um/c2 of the magnetic moment is

The total system energy divided by c2 is the sum of the energies of the parts (magnetic

The total momentum includes the momentum contributions from the magnetic moment

from the magnetic ﬁelds of the magnetic moment charges and the electrostati c ﬁeld of the
passing charge. The electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum involves terms of the form ebqvb/rbq

The net Lorentz forces between the magnetic moment and the passing charge q are of
order 1/c2, and hence any net transfer of energy must be of order 1/c2. Therefore the
energies divided by c2, Um/c2 and Uq/c2, can be regarded as constant when we negelct
terms of order 1/c4. Although the energies divided by c2 may be regarded as constant, the
locations of the energies do indeed change in order 1/c2, and the continuity of the changing
energy locations is a signif icant relativistic departure from nonrelativistic mechanics. Thus
whereas nonrelativistic mechanics has no local location for energy and allows energy to be
freely transfered from one point to another distant point, special relativity insists on a l ocal
location and transfer of energy. This idea is reﬂected in the constant motion of the center of
energy for a closed relativistic system. Thus taking the time-derivative of Eq.(59), we have

Now we recognize the ﬁrst three terms following the last equal sign as the linear momentum

However, there are two additional, unfamiliar terms involving the accelerations ab, ab′ of the

F = Ma in terms of the forces Fonb, Fonb′ acting on the charg es eb and eb′; since the terms

(cid:18)
The term (Fonb · vb)rb/c2 represents the power introduced by the force Fonb on the charge eb
moving with velocity vb located at rb, and there is a similar term for eb′ . At some points in
its orbit the charge eb receives energy from the ﬁeld Eq and at other points it returns this
energy. Thus the constant motion of the total system center of energy includes the motion of
the center of energy of t he magnetic moment system associated with the power introduced
at the positions rb and rb′ of the charges of the magnetic moment. This eﬀect is familiar
from the student relativity problem involving the shift of the energy from one end of a plank
to another by the energy transferred by a conveyor belt.[33] This is the emphatic reminder
that energy in relativity has a local existence and that accounting for the local transfer of
energy is an integral part of the theor y.

Now in our simple system involving point charges described by the Darwin Lagrangian,
one can show that the power ﬂow within the magnetic moment given in Eq.(62) is equal
to the linear momentum within the electromagnetic ﬁeld.[1] Thus using th e nonrelativistic
(0-order in 1/c) equations of motion

where we have used the same sort of averaging as described earlier in Section 4b. We note
that there is no average internal energy transfer within the atom itself between the orbiting
charge eb and the heavy nucleus eb′ in the unperturbed mo tion; indeed, in our example
where the unperturbed orbits are circular, the power transfer between the nucleus and the

circulating charge vanishes at all times.[34] Thus the energy transfer within the unperturbed
magnetic moment is due entirely to t he electrostatic ﬁeld of the passing charge q. Although
the electrostatic ﬁeld of q delivers no average energy to the magnetic moment, this elec-
trostatic ﬁeld does bring about a redistribution of energy within the magnetic moment. In
the rel ativistic Darwin Lagrangian where the nonrelativistic forces are Coulomb forces, the
contribution to the uniform motion of the center of energy of the magnetic moment is equal
to the linear momentum in the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Thus using equation (64), the uniform
motion of the center of energy for the total system in Eq.(62) can be written in the form[1]

which takes the same form as the statement of conservation of linear momentum for the
system but where actually both the momentum of the magnetic moment and the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld momentum terms are associated with the motion of the center of ener gy of
the magnetic moment.

We emphasize that the internal transfer of energy between diﬀerent locations of the
magnetic moment, which gives a motion of the center of energy of the magnetic moment,
represents an instabilty of the magnetic moment system. The energy distri bution within
the magnetic moment is being changed, as seen in the orbit distortion noted by Solem for
the classical hydrogen atom.[35] A stable system will react in such a way as to prevent this
internal redistribution of energy. In our relativist ic example here, the orbit of the magnetic
moment charge eb is altered in just such a way as to give a changing magnetic moment
which puts an electric force back on the passing charge. In addition, the changing magnetic
moment acts to decreases t he change in linear momentum in the electromagnetic ﬁeld and
also to decrease the change of the velocity of the center of energy of the magnetic moment
due to the internal energy transfer.

If we diﬀerentiate equation (65) with respect to time, then we obtain the familiar con-
servation of linear momentum for the system of the magnetic moment and external charge
as well as a statement about the accelerations of the centers of energy of the charge q and
the magnetic moment m,

6. PROPOSED INTERACTION OF A POINT CHARGE AND A MAGNET
a) Discussion of the Equations of Motion for a Magnetic Moment

In our relativistic model of a magnetic moment using the Darwin Lagrangian, the mass
times the acceleration of the center of energy of the magnetic moment moves as given in
Eq.(68). This equation corresponds to exactly the expression given by Haus a nd Penn-
ﬁeld[36]. However, the equation does not actually give the acceleration of the magnetic
moment center of energy because it does not determine dm/dt, the time-rate-of-change of
the magnetic moment. Only a detailed model for the ma gnetic moment will provide this
information, just as illustrated for our hydrogen-atom magnetic moment model.

It appears that many researchers are unaware of the possible signiﬁcant alteration in the
magnetic moment, and therefore rewrite the equation as though the magnetic moment were
constant. In this case the equation takes the form

Um
c2

d2Xm

(69)

which is the form given by Aharonov, Peale, and Vaidman.[5] This is also the equation given
for the force on a magnetic moment formed from two magnetic monopoles,[38] where we
would not expect any variation of the magnetic moment due to interaction with a passing
charge. However, this formualation is not valid for a relativistic current-loop magnetic
moment where m will change with time.

The electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum Pem = (q/c)Am(rq, t) = −(m(t)/c) × Eq(rm, t)
changes for two reasons: because of the relative motion of q and m and because of the change
of the magnetic moment m. In our relativisitic hydrogen-atom magnetic moment model,
the magnetic moment m changes in such a way as to decrease the change in electromagnetic
ﬁeld momentum and to provide an unexpected force on the passing charge. We propose
that a stable multiparticle magnetic moment will act not so as to counteract this behavior
but rather such as to complete it, so as to make make negligible the internal transfer of
energy from one part of the magnetic mom ent to another while providing a force back on
the passing charge which is the Newton’s third law reaction to the magnetic Lorentz force
of the passing charge on the magnetic moment. Thus what we are proposing is that the
magnetic moment changes in just such a fashion that

dPem

(70)

This corresponds to no change in the electromagntic ﬁeld linear momentum, and also, be-
cause this ﬁeld momentum is related to the internal shift in the energy of the magnetic
moment, to no shift in the internal energy distribution of the magnetic mo ment. But then
the equation of motion of the magnetic moment becomes the old familiar

d2Xm
dt2 = Fm
where the acceleration of the center of energy of the magnetic moment is connected to the
Lorentz force on the magnetic moment by Newton’s second law F = Ma. Furthermore,
Newton’s third law is valid and equations (66) and (68) can be rewritten as

(72)

Thus the change of a multiparticle magnetic moment in this fashion brings us back to familiar
basic physics, but with also the unfamiliar idea that the Lorentz force on a passing charge
q includes the electric ﬁeld arising from the changing magnet ic moment.
b) Analogy with a Conductor in Electrostatics

There is a close analogy between the situation for a point charge outside a conductor and
a point charge outside a neutral long solenoid. Both involved the interaction of a point charge
with a stable, multiparticle structure. Just as the unper turbed conductor has no electric
or magnetic ﬁeld outside, so the long solenoid has no electric or magnetic ﬁelds outside.
Therefore a point charge outside an unperturbed conductor experiences no force, just as a
point charge outside an unperturbe d solenoid experiences no force. Also, the unperturbed
conductor experiences no net force due to the external charge, just as the unperturbed
solenoid experiences no net energy transfer (0-order in 1/c) due to the electrostatic ﬁeld
of the passin g charge. However, the electrostatic ﬁeld of the point charge puts diﬀerent
forces on the diﬀerent charges of the conductor, leading to a transfer of momentum from
one part (positive charges) of the conductor to another (negative charges). This leads to an
instability which is eventually stabilized by the conductor so as to stop the net transfer of
momentum from one part of the conductor to another while producing net forces between
the conductor and the external charge which satisfy Newton ’s third law. In the case of the
solenoid, the external electrostatic ﬁeld puts forces on the currents which lead to a transfer
of energy from one part (where currents approach the passing charge q) of the solenoid to
another (where currents move away from q). In a relativistic system, energy has a localized
existence. The transfer of energy from one part of the solenoid to another represents a shift
of the center of energy corresponding to an instability. We suggest that this instabili ty is
eventually stabilized by the solenoid so as to halt the transfer of energy from one part of
the solenoid to another while producing net forces between the solenoid and the external
charge which satisfy Newton’s third law. For the case of a con ductor, the beginnings of
such stabilizing behavior can be seen for a point charge near an isotropic dipole oscillator,
which oscillator could be used as a polarizable building element for a conducting wall. In
this article, we have shown the beginn ings of such stabilizing behavior for a hydrogen-atom
model for a magnetic moment, which hydrogen-atom can be used as a building element for
a solenoid.
7. THE AHARONOV-BOHM AND AHARONOV-CASHER PHASE SHIFTS
a) Connection with Charge-Magnet Interaction

The Aharonov-Bohm phase shift involves the quantum interference pattern shift occur-
ring when electrons (point charges) pass on opposite sides of a solenoid or toroid (stacks of
magnetic moments) and then are recombined to give a particle interfe rence pattern.[6,7]
The Aharonov-Casher phase shift involves neutrons (magnetic moments) passing on oppo-
site sides of a line charge (stack of point charges).[8,9] Both interference pattern shifts are
presented in the theoretical literature and in q uantum mechanics texts books as examples
of quantum topological eﬀects occurring in the absence of classical electromagnetic forces.
Actually however, the classical electromagnetic forces between the charges and the magnetic
moments have probably b een completely misunderstood because of the nonrelativistic clas-
sical electromagnetic models for magnetic moments which appear in the instructional and

23

research literature. Special relativity has many paradoxes for the unwary, and this is prob-
ably o ne of them.[39] When a relativistic model for a magnetic moment is used, then the
forces between a point charge and a magnetic moment are completely diﬀerent from those
of the usual nonrelativistic model. Indeed, the relativistic force calculation s lead to the
likelihood that the observed phase shifts are based upon classical electromagnetic forces[40]
and are not due to any new quantum topological eﬀect which represents a further departure
from classical physics.

It has been pointed out in earlier work[40] that the classical electromagnetic analysis for
both the Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher phase shifts reduces to an understanding
of the interaction of a point charge and magnetic dipole moment. Thu s by stacking mag-
netic moments appropriately one can pass from the basic charge-moment interaction over
to the charge-solenoid or charge-toroid interactions which are involved in the Aharonov-
Bohm phase shift. By stacking point charges appropriately , one can pass from the basic
charge-moment interaction over to the line charge-moment interaction of the Aharonov-
Casher phase shift. However, the current understanding of the classical electromagnetic
forces between a point charge and a solenoid i s such that classical forces have been rejected
as the basis for the Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher phase shifts. The current view
in physics turns for understanding not to relativistic classical electromagnetic inteactions
but rather to an ad ho c, non-local quantum topological eﬀect suggested by Aharonov and
Bohm at the same time that they proposed the experiment. I believe that topological view
is singularly unhelpful and may not even give all the experimentally detectable aspects of
the eﬀect.[41] The quantum calculation for the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift makes use of the
nonrelativistic Schroedinger equation. However, the eﬀect is actually a relativistic shift of
order 1/c2, and, since the corresponding classical problem has never been given an adequate
Hamilton-Jacobi formulation, there remains considerable uncertainty as to what classical
situation is actually represented by the Schroedinger equation for a charged particle passing
a long solenoid.
b) The Claimed Quantum Topological Eﬀect vs Classical Forces

For nearly thirty years I have suggested that the ﬁeld of the passing charge q must cause
changes in the currents of the magnetic moment (or solenoid or toroid) and that the changing
currents must produce electric ﬁelds back at the passing c harge which might account for
the experimentally observed Aharonov-Bohm phase shift.[42] However, these suggestions
have been almost universally ignored, and my recent manuscripts have been rejected by
The Physical Review.[43] The referee(s) at Th e Physical Review claim that my views are
impossible because of the following argument.[44] There are no electric or magnetic ﬁelds
outside the winding of a long unperturbed solenoid. Therefore the ﬁelds back at the passing
charge must be due to a perturbation which will be of order qeb where eb is the charge of
a particle in the solenod. These perturbations then produce an electric ﬁeld of order qe2
b
which then produces a force of order q2e2
b back at the passing charge. In deed, in the present
article, we saw that the rigid-ring model for a magnetic moment gave a Faraday induced
electric ﬁeld and force back at the passing charge q of order q2e2
b/c4 which was independent
of the magnitude of the magnetic moment. This is totally diﬀerent from forces necessary to
account for the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift where the back force must depend linearly on
q/c and on the magnetic moment m.

The question of the interaction of a magnetic moment with an external charge came up

24

even more emphatically in connection with the Aharonov-Casher phase shift which these
authors claimed was the ”dual” of the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift.
In this case the au-
thors claimed that there was no force on a magnetic moment passing a line charge λ.[8]
Actually there is indeed a net Lorentz force on a magnetic moment modeled as a current
loop[45]; however, Aharonov and Casher used a magnetic m oment model involving ﬁxed
magnetic charges, and for that model there is no force for their situation.
It was shown
that when the magnetic dipole moment was modeled as a current loop and Newton’s second
law F = Ma together with th e Lorentz force on a magnetic moment Fm = ∇(m · Bλ)
was used, then Aharonov-Casher phase shift could be understood as based upon a classical
electromagnetic lag eﬀect arising from classical electromagnetic forces.[45] In the ensuing
controversy Aharonov, Pearle, and Vaidman conceded that a magnetic moment, modeled as
a current loop, indeed experiences the suggested net Lorentz force.[46] Nevertheless, because
of ”hidden momentum in magnets,” they i nsisted that the center of energy of the magnetic
moment still moves in space as though it experiences no Lorentz force. In other words, the
electric ﬁeld of the line charge λ causes confusion behind the scenes in the passing magnetic
momen t, but the center of energy of the magnetic moment and of the line charge are both
unaﬀected. General experience suggests that nature does not behave this way. Aharonov,
Pearl, and Vaidman introduced the equation of motion (69) to justify their as sertion of
uniform motion, and their view seems to have prevailed in the physics community.[47]

In the present article, we readress this long-standing controvery at its foundations. For
a general magnet we are unable to carry through the full calculation of dm/dt. However,
in the case of our relativistic magnetic moment model i nvolving classical hydrodgen atoms,
we showed that a surprising, unanticipated, classical electromagnetic force indeed occurs.

In the traditional, rigid-loop model for a magnetic moment (which is not a relativis-
tic model), we saw that Faraday induction produced a back force at the passing charge
Fonq = (q/c)(nq/r2
q ) × (dm/dt) proport ional to q2e2/c4 where dm/dt arose from the chang-
ing magnetic ﬂux due to the magnetic ﬁeld Bq(0) = (q/c)[vq × (−nq)]/r2
q and two more
factors of 1/c are added by Faraday’s law Emf = −(1/c)(dφ/dt) (where φ is the magnetic
ﬂux), and the deﬁnition of a magnetic dipole moment. However, in the relativistic (to order
v2/c2) model of a magnetic moment, there is a totally diﬀerent mechanism which gives rise
to a changing magnetic mom ent. This is the changing magnetic moment which arises from
Solem’s fascinating observation regarding the strange polarization of the classical hydrogen
atom. A nonrelativistic classical hydrogen atom does not become polarized like a harmonic
oscil lator. On the contrary, the nonrelativistic atom changes its orbit and its angular mo-
mentum due to a weak external electric ﬁeld. Thus the magnetic moment m = [e/(2Mc)]L
of the nonrelativistic orbit changes. The magnetic moment changes not due to Faraday
induction from the magnetic ﬁeld of the passing charge q but rather from the nonrelativistic
alteration of the orbit due to the electric ﬁeld of the passing charge q. The electric ﬁeld back
at the passing charge is not the nonrelativistic result of the rigid loop model, but rather is or
order q3e3ω/c2 where ω is the angular velocity of the charge e in Coulomb orbit which pro-
duces the magnetic moment. Thus this electric force on the passing c harge indeed depends
on the magnetic moment eR2ω/(2c), which is in total contrast with the Faraday-induced
force for a rigid-loop model of a magnetic moment. In this relativistic case, the back force
is odd in the charge q of the passing p article. In the relativistic case there is indeed a rela-
tive classical lag eﬀect which reverses for charges passing on opposite sides of the magnetic

25

moment. There is indeed the qualitative basis for understanding the Aharonov-Bohm and
Aharonov-Ca sher phase shifts as based upon classical electromagnetic forces.

In our simple relativistic model, we assumed that the classical atoms forming the mag-
netic moment did not interact. If they did interact, then the changing magnetic moment
dm/dt would be diﬀerent. What has been suggested is that fo r a realistic multiparticle
magnetic moment dm/dt assumes exactly the value such the magnetic moment moves un-
der just the net Lorentz force produced by the passing charge. If this is indeed the case,
then the Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Ca sher phase shifts would be understood as arising
from a classical electromagnetic lag eﬀect arising from classical electromagnetic forces be-
tween the point charge and the magnetic moment. In the case of the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect,
the passing charge is not moving in a ﬁeld-free region but rather experiences a net Lorentz
force Fq = [(qvq/c) · ∇q]Am(rq) which is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to
the Lorentz force on the solenoid.[40] The Lorentz force on the solenoid is due entirely to
the familiar magnetic force Fm = Σb(ebvb/c) × Bq(rb, t) arising from the magnetic ﬁeld of
the passing charge, while the Lorentz force on the pas sing charge in the case of an inﬁnite
solenoid or toroid is due entirely to the changes dm/dt in the magnetic moments of which
the solenoid can be regarded as composed.[48]
c) The Connections Between Classical and Quantum Physics

During the second quarter of the twentieth century there developed a rough sense of the
connections between classical and quantum physics which eventually gave expression to the
stochastic interpretations of quantum mechanics[49] and to stochast ic electrodynamics.[50]
This rough understanding is challenged by the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect which purports to be a
quantum topological eﬀect occurring in the absence of classical electromagnetic forces. This
new point of view has entered the textbo ok literature. Griﬃths, with his usual clarity, gives
one of the sharpest expressions of this new point of view. In his quantum text he writes,
”What are we to make of the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect? Evidently our classical preconceptions
are simply ⁀extitmistaken: There can be electromagnetic eﬀects in regions where the ﬁelds
are zero.”[51] I believe that this point of view is probably in error.

For thirty years there have been attempts to understand the experimentally-observed
Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher phase shifts within the older semiclassical under-
standing of the connection between classical and quantum theories.[40,41,42] The classical
electromagnetic phenomena associated with these phase shifts have provided fertile clues to
aspects of classical electromagnetic theory which had been previously overlooked. And all
of the new results obtained tend to increase the like lihood of a semiclassical explanation of
these phase shifts. Thus persistence of the phase shift when the solenoid was surrounded by a
conductor[52] led to the realization that electromagnetic velocity ﬁelds have an algebraic fall
oﬀ in conductors which is quite diﬀerent from the exponential damping of electromagnetic
wave ﬁelds, and also to the result that the magnetic velocity ﬁelds penetrate conductors
independently of the conductivity at low velocities.[53] These results have been acc epted
into the textbook literature.[54] The decrease of the magnetic velocity ﬁelds at high veloci-
ties[55] led to the discovery of a new time-integral invariant of the magnetic velocity ﬁelds
of a passing charge which is entirely independent of an y ohmic conductors which may be
present,[56] and only this invariant time-integral enters the classical basis for the Aharonov-
Bohm phase shift.[40] The frequent objections that the phase shift could not be caused by
classical electromagnetic forces has led to the rethinking of the interaction of a point charge

26

and a magnetic moment presented in the present article. Thus attempts to give a semiclas-
sical understanding of the Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher phase shifts have led to
a new unde rstanding of the penetration of electric and magnetic velocity ﬁelds into ohmic
conductors and to a new understanding of the point charge-magnetic moment interaction.
8. CLOSING SUMMARY

In this article we consider two diﬀerent models for magnetic moments. First we discuss
a commonly used magnetic moment model which is not relativistic. This model involves a
single charged particle eb sliding on a frictionless rigid circul ar ring of opposite charge. The
rigid structure immediately betrays the nonrelativistic character of the model. We ﬁnd that
a point charge q passing this rigid-ring model produces a Faraday induction force back on
the passing charge which is of or der (ebq)2/c4. This force is negligible since we retain forces
only through order 1/c2. This inadequate model, which is not relativisitic, has no possibility
of giving accurate forces at the relativistic level between the passing charge and the magnetic
dipole moment. The model does not give forces remotely appropriate to provide a classical
explanation of the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift.

The second model satisﬁes the requirements of special relativity through order 1/c2, but
is not realistic for a many-particle magnet. This magnetic-moment model consists of many
classical hydrogen atoms (and anti-atoms) superimposed, the at oms interacting with an
exteral charge q but not with each other. When we apply Solem’s analysis for the strange
polarization of the classical hydrogen atom, we ﬁnd totally new aspects for the interaction
of a point charge and a magnetic moment. T here is a change in the magnetic moment of
the hydrogen atom which occurs due to the nonrelativistic interaction of the hydrogen atom
with an external electric ﬁeld. We then follow the analysis of Coleman and Van Vleck using
the Darwin Lagrangian a nd note the role of the hidden momentum. It seems interesting
that Coleman and Van Vleck are aware of the role of the electric ﬁeld of the passing charge
q in inﬂuencing the hidden momentum of the magnet in order 1/c2, but do not seem aware
of the role of the electric ﬁeld in causing a change in the magnetic moment; Solem is aware
of the inﬂuence of the electric ﬁeld in changing the angular momentum of the nonrelativistic
hydrogen atom but does not comment on the associated change in the magnetic moment.
The changing magnetic moment leads to electric forces back on a passing charge which are
bω/c2. These forces have the qualitative behavior to ﬁt with a classical-based
of order q3e3

explanation of the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift.
ii) The forces involve odd powers of the passing charge.
iii) The forces are linear in the
magnetic moment. iv) The forces in the direction of motion are reversed on opposite sides
of the solenoid.

The third part of this article considers what behavior we might expect from a more re-
alistic magnetic moment (such as a solenoid or bar magnet) where all the charged particles
interact. In this case we argue from the analogy of the behavior of a conductor and the
relativistic magnetic moment model above. We suggest that a realistic magnet acts so as to
stop the redistribution of the mass-moments of the system. This criterion is equivalent to
assuming that the rate of change of the magnet ic moment is precisely such as to give van-
ishing change in the electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum between the magnet and the passing
charge. It also is precisely such as to give equal and opposite Lorentz forces on the magnet
and the external charge, an d it also is precisely such as to have the center of energy of the
magnet and of the passing charge move according to Newton’s second law F = Ma where F

27

is the Lorentz force on each object. The criterion is also precisel y such as to give a classical
electromagnetic lag eﬀect as the basis for the Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher phase
shifts while restoring the usual connection between classical and quantum theories for these
phenomena.

phase shift can not possibly arise as the result of classical electromagnetic forces.

[25] This linear momentum must be associated with the rigid-wire constraint. Clearly it is not
provided by the electrostatic ﬁeld Eq(0, t). See T.H. Boyer, ”Classical Electromagnetism

[34] The transfer of energy within the atom itself for non-circular orbits leads to the rela-

tivisitic precession of the nonrelativistic elliptical orbit.

[35] Although the center of mass of the ebeb′-system does not change with the orbit distortion,
the center of energy of the orbit does shift in order 1/c2 because the average kinetic and
potential energy distribution shifts.

[39] It is my opinion that one of the signiﬁcant failures of twentieth century theoreti-
cal physics was the inconsistent application of relativistic principles. Although the
Aharonov-Bohm phase shift is an experimentally observed aspe ct of nature, the the-
oretical, quantum-topological Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect may well go the same way as the
theory of phlogiston.

[43] Refs. 40 and 41 were published elsewhere after being rejected by Physical Review A.
[44] In his review of two recent manuscripts, (Ref. 40), rejected by The Physical Review, the
referee wrote the following regarding the ﬁrst paper: ”The central concrete point of the
paper, which has been published many times before by the same author, is that there is
a non-vanishing classical force on a charge passing the solenoid in the usual AB eﬀect.
That assertion is false. A charge moving in a ﬁeld-free region experiences no force. If an
electromagnetic ﬁeld is induced by the passage of the charge, the resulting force on the
charge must be proportional to q2. The author states that it is proportional to (v/c)2,
but neglects to say that the same argument makes it proportional to (qv/c)2. In fact,
the force i s exactly zero in the AB case.”

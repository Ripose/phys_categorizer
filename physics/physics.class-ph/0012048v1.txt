Di(cid:27)erent approahes to speial relativity (SR) are disussed. The (cid:28)rst approah is an invariant

approah, whih we all the (cid:17)true transformations (TT) relativity.(cid:17)

In this approah a physial

quantity in the four-dimensional spaetime is mathematially represented either by a true tensor

(when no basis has been introdued) or equivalently by a oordinate-based geometri quantity

omprising both omponents and a basis (when some basis has been introdued). This invari-

ant approah is ompared with the usual ovariant approah, whih mainly deals with the basis

omponents of tensors in a spei(cid:28), i.e., Einstein's oordinatization of the hosen inertial frame of

referene. The third approah is the usual nonovariant approah to SR in whih some quantities

are not tensor quantities, but rather quantities from (cid:17)3+1(cid:17) spae and time, e.g., the synhronously

determined spatial length. This formulation is alled the (cid:17)apparent transformations (AT) relativ-

the onept of sameness of a physial quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers. This di(cid:27)erene is investigated

onsidering the spaetime length in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) and spatial and temporal distanes in the

(cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17) It is also found that the usual transformations of the three-vetors (3-vetors) of

the eletri and magneti (cid:28)elds E and B are the AT. Furthermore it is proved that the Maxwell
equations with the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld tensor F ab
and the usual Maxwell equations with E and
B are not equivalent, and that the Maxwell equations with E and B do not remain unhanged in
form when the Lorentz transformations of the ordinary derivative operators and the AT of E and B
are used. The Maxwell equations with F ab
are written in terms of the 4-vetors of the eletri Ea

1. INTRODUCTION

At present there are two formulations of the lassial eletrodynamis. The (cid:28)rst one is the mani-

festly ovariant formulation, whih deals with the omponent form, in Einstein's oordinatization,

of the tensor quantities and tensor equations in the four-dimensional (4D) spaetime, and where

the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld tensor F αβ

(the omponent form; for the notation see the next setion)

ontains all the information about the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld. The seond one is the nonovariant

formulation dealing with the three-vetors (3-vetors), the eletri (cid:28)eld E and the magneti (cid:28)eld
B, and with equations ontaining them. The whole latter formulation is given in (cid:17)3+1(cid:17) spae and

(1)

time and was onstruted by Maxwell before the appearane of Einstein's theory of relativity.

(2,3)

In the reent papers

I have presented an alternative ovariant formulation of vauum ele-

trodynamis with the eletri and magneti 4-vetors Eα
is equivalent to the usual ovariant formulation with F αβ
. The ovariant formulation with F αβ
and the usual formulation with E and B are generally onsidered to be equivalent. It is shown in
Refs. 2 and 3 that the equivalene between ovariant formulations (either the usual one with F αβ
and Bα
or equivalently the alternative one with Eα

and Bα

) and the usual nonovariant formulation does

(also the omponent form), whih

,

not exist.

(5)

In Ref. 4 Rohrlih introdued the notions of the true transformations (TT) and the apparent

transformations (AT) of physial quantities and emphasized the role of sameness of a physial

quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers. This onept of sameness is also onsidered in the same sense by

Gamba.

Their formulations also refer to the omponent form, in Einstein's oordinatization, of

the tensor quantities and tensor equations.

1

In this paper we explore a formulation of speial relativity (SR) that is borrowed from general

relativity. This is the formulation in whih all physial quantities (in the ase when no basis has

been introdued) are desribed by true tensor (cid:28)elds, that are de(cid:28)ned on the 4D spaetime, and

that satisfy true tensor equations representing physial laws. When the oordinate system has

been introdued the physial quantities are mathematially represented by the oordinate-based

geometri quantities (CBGQs) that satisfy the oordinate-based geometri equations (CBGEs).

The CBGQs ontain both the omponents and the basis one-forms and vetors of the hosen inertial

frame of referene (IFR). The symmetry transformations for the metri gab , i.e., the isometries,

leave the pseudo-Eulidean geometry of 4D spaetime of SR unhanged. At the same time they

do not hange the true tensor quantities, or equivalently the CBGQs, in physial equations. Thus

isometries are what Rohrlih

alls the TT. The formulation of SR that deals with true tensor

(4)

quantities and the TT is alled the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) In Se. 2 we give some spei(cid:28) examples of

the TT, i.e., of the isometries. They are the ovariant 4D Lorentz transformation La
also Refs. 3, 6 and 7), or its representations in di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations, Lµ
(5), and also the transformations T µ

′

b (1) (see

′

ν,e (2) and Lµ

ν,r

ν (4) that onnet the Einstein oordinatization with another

oordinatization of the onsidered IFR. In the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations of an IFR

are allowed and they are all equivalent in the desription of physial phenomena. Partiularly

two very di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations, the Einstein ((cid:17)e(cid:17))

and (cid:17)radio(cid:17) ((cid:17)r(cid:17))

oordinatization, are

(1)

(8)

exposed in Se. 2 and exploited throughout the paper.

As explained in Se. 2 the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) approah di(cid:27)ers from the usual ovariant approah

as well. In the usual ovariant approah one does not deal with the true tensors but with the basis

omponents of tensors (mainly in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization) and with the equations of physis written

out in the omponent form. (In the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization the Einstein synhronization

of distant

loks and artesian spae oordinates xi

are used in the hosen IFR.)

(1)

In ontrast to the TT the AT are not the transformations of spaetime tensors and they do

not refer to the same quantity. Thus they are not isometries and they refer exlusively to the

omponent form of tensor quantities and in that form they transform only some omponents of the

whole tensor quantity. In fat, depending on the used AT, only a part of a 4D tensor quantity is

transformed by the AT. Suh a part of a 4D quantity, when onsidered in di(cid:27)erent IFRs (or in

di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations of some IFR) orresponds to di(cid:27)erent quantities in 4D spaetime. Some

examples of the AT are: the AT of the synhronously de(cid:28)ned spatial length,

i.e., the Lorentz

(cid:17)ontration(cid:17)

and the AT of the temporal distane, i.e., the onventional (cid:17)dilatation(cid:17) of

(4,5,3,7,9)

(1)

time that is introdued in Ref. 1 and onsidered in Refs. 7 and 9, and as disussed in Refs. 2 and 3,

the AT of the eletri and magneti 3-vetors E and B (the onventional transformations of E and
B, see, e.g., Ref. 10 Se.11.10). The formulation of SR whih uses the AT we all the (cid:17)apparent

transformations (AT) relativity.(cid:17) An example of suh formulation is Einstein's formulation of SR

whih is based on his two postulates and whih deals with all the mentioned AT.

The di(cid:27)erenes between the TT and the AT are examined onsidering some spei(cid:28) examples.

First the spaetime lengths, orresponding in (cid:17)3+1(cid:17) piture to a moving rod and to a moving lok,

are onsidered in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) in Ses. 3.1 and 3.2. Furthermore the spatial and temporal

distanes for the same examples are examined in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) in Ses. 4.1 and 4.2. The

omparison with the experiments on the Lorentz ontration and the time dilatation is performed

in Ref. 9 and it shows that all experiments an be qualitatively and quantitatively explained by

the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) while some experiments annot be adequately explained by the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17)

The seond part of this paper is an eletrodynami part in whih it is proved that the onven-

tional transformations of E and B are the AT, Ses. 5.1-5.3, that the usual Maxwell equations with
the 3-vetors E and B are not equivalent with the tensor Maxwell's equations with F ab

is that this formulation of eletrodynamis does not make use

, and thus dispenses with the need for gauge

onditions. Using Ma jorana formulation we (cid:28)nd a Dira like relativisti wave equation for the free

photon in Se. 6.3 (see also

). In Se. 7 we present summary and onlusions.

2. A GENERAL DISCUSSION ON THE (cid:17)TT RELATIVITY(cid:17)

The prinipal di(cid:27)erene between the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) the usual ovariant formulation and the

(cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) stems from the di(cid:27)erene in the onept of sameness of a physial system, i.e., of a

physial quantity, for di(cid:27)erent observers. This onept atually determines the di(cid:27)erene in what

is to be understood as a relativisti theory.

Thus in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) a physial quantity is mathematially represented either by a true

tensor or by a CBGQ omprising both omponents and a basis. (Speaking in mathematial lan-

guage a tensor of type (k,l) is de(cid:28)ned as a linear funtion of k one-forms and l vetors (in old names,

k ovariant vetors and l ontravariant vetors) into the real numbers, see, e.g., Refs. 11, 12 and

13. If a oordinate system is hosen in some IFR then, in general, any tensor quantity an be

reonstruted from its omponents and from the basis vetors and basis 1-forms of that frame, i.e.,

it an be written in a oordinate-based geometri language.

) The CBGQs representing some 4D

(13)

physial quantity in di(cid:27)erent relatively moving inertial frames of referene (IFRs), or in di(cid:27)erent

oordinatizations of the hosen IFR, are al l mathematial ly equal. Thus they are really the same

quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers, or in di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations. We suppose that in the (cid:17)TT rela-

tivity(cid:17) suh 4D tensor quantities are well-de(cid:28)ned not only mathematially but also experimental ly,

as measurable quantities with real physial meaning. The omplete and wel l-de(cid:28)ned measurement

from the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) viewpoint is suh measurement in whih al l parts of some 4D quantity are

measured.

In the usual ovariant approah (inluding Refs. 4 and 5) the basis omponents of a true tensor,

or equivalently of a CBGQ, that are determined in di(cid:27)erent IFRs (or in di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations),

are onsidered to be the same quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers. It is true that these omponents

refer to the same tensor quantity but they annot be equal sine the bases are not inluded.

Mathematially speaking the onept of a tensor in the usual ovariant approah is de(cid:28)ned entirely

in terms of the transformation properties of its omponents relative to some oordinate system.

In the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) as we already said, CBGQs (omprising both omponents and a basis),

whih represent some 4D physial quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers, are all mathematially equal.

Therefore the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) approah (whih deals with the true tensors or with the CBGQs) is

an invariant approah to SR in ontrast to the usual ovariant approah (whih deals with the

omponents of tensors). Obviously one an use di(cid:27)erent possible oordinatizations in the (cid:17)TT

relativity(cid:17) approah. We shall expliitly use two very di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations, the (cid:17)e(cid:17) and (cid:17)r(cid:17)

oordinatizations, see below.

All this an be illustrated by a simple example, i.e., onsidering the distane 4-vetor (the (1, 0)

B − xa

AB = xa

A between two events A and B (with the position 4-vetors xa

tensor) la
B ). It
an be equivalently represented in the oordinate-based geometri language in di(cid:27)erent bases, {eµ}
and {rµ} in an IFR S, and {eµ′ } and {rµ′ } in a relatively moving IFR S′, as la
r rµ =
e eν′ = lµ
lν
omponents when the Einstein oordinatization is hosen in some IFR S. The subsript

AB = lµ
r rµ′ , where, e.g., eµ are the basis 4-vetors, e0 = (1, 0, 0, 0) and so on, and lµ

AB are all mathematially equal quantities and thus they are really

the same quantity onsidered in di(cid:27)erent relatively moving IFRs and in di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations.

This is the treatment of the distane 4-vetor in the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) On the other hand the usual

ovariant approah does not onsider the whole tensor quantity, the distane 4-vetor la
only the basis omponents, lµ
e and lν
above equalities for the CBGQs, the sets of omponents, e.g., lµ
equal, lµ

AB, but
e , in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization. Note that, in ontrast to the
e , taken alone, are not
e , and thus they are not the same quantity from the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) viewpoint.

From the mathematial point of view the omponents of, e.g., a (1, 0) tensor are its values (real
numbers) when the basis one-form, for example, eα, is its argument (see, e.g., Ref. 12). Thus,
AB(eα) = lµ
for example, la
is the basis one-form in an IFR S and in the (cid:17)e(cid:17)
oordinatization), while la
in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization). Obviously lα

and

In the above disussion and heneforward I adopt the following onvention with regard to

indies. Repeated indies imply summation. Latin indies a, b, c, d, ... are to be read aording to

the abstrat index notation, Ref. 11, Se.2.4.; they (cid:17)...should be viewed as reminders of the number

and type of variables the tensor ats on, not as basis omponents.(cid:17) They designate geometri

ob jets in 4D spaetime. Thus, e.g., la
A are (1,0) tensors and they are de(cid:28)ned independently
of any oordinate system. Greek indies run from 0 to 3, while latin indies i, j, k, l, ... run from 1

AB, xa

to 3, and they both designate the omponents of some geometri ob jet in some oordinate system,

′

′

′

e.g., xµ(x0, xi) and xµ
two di(cid:27)erent inertial oordinate systems S and S′. Similarly the metri tensor gab denotes a tensor
of type (0,2) (whose Riemann urvature tensor Ra

) are two oordinate representations of the position 4-vetor xa

bcd is everywhere vanishing; the spaetime of

(x0

, xi

in

speial relativity is a (cid:29)at spaetime, and this de(cid:28)nition inludes not only the IFRs but also the

aelerated frames of referene). This geometri ob jet gab is represented in some IFR S, and in the
(cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, by the 4 × 4 diagonal matrix of omponents of gab , gµν,e = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1),
and this matrix is usually alled the Minkowski metri tensor.

We shall also need the expression for the ovariant 4D Lorentz transformations La

The geometry of the spaetime is generally de(cid:28)ned by the metri tensor gab, whih an be expand

As shown in Refs. 3 and 7 we an also hoose another oordinatization, the (cid:17)everyday(cid:17) or (cid:17)radio(cid:17)

(8)

((cid:17)r(cid:17)) oordinatization,

whih di(cid:27)ers from the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization by the di(cid:27)erent proedure for

the synhronization of distant loks. Di(cid:27)erent synhronizations are determined by the parameter ε
in the relation t2 = t1+ε(t3−t1), where t1 and t3 are the times of departure and arrival, respetively,
of the light signal, read by the lok at A, and t2 is the time of re(cid:29)etion at B , read by the lok
at B , that has to be synhronized with the lok at A. In Einstein's synhronization onvention
ε = 1/2. In the (cid:17)r(cid:17) synhronization ε = 0 and thus, in ontrast to the (cid:17)e(cid:17) synhronization, there is

an absolute simultaneity. As explained in Ref. 8: (cid:17)For if we turn on the radio and set our lok

by the standard announement (cid:17)...at the sound of the last tone, it will be 12 o'lok(cid:17), then we

have synhronized our lok with the studio lok in a manner that orresponds to taking ε = 0
in t2 = t1 + ε(t3 − t1).(cid:17) The (cid:17)r(cid:17) synhronization

(8)

is an assymetri synhronization whih leads

to an assymetry in the oordinate, one-way, speed of light. However from the physial point of

view the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization is ompletely equivalent to the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization. This also holds

for all other permissible oordinatizations. Suh situation really happens in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17)

sine the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) deals with true tensors and the true tensor equations, or equivalently

with the CBGQs and CBGEs. Thus the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) deals on the same footing with all possible

oordinatizations of the hosen IFR. As a onsequene the seond Einstein postulate referred to

the onstany of the oordinate veloity of light, in general, does not hold in the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17)

Namely, only in Einstein's oordinatization the oordinate, one-way, speed of light is isotropi and

onstant.

The basis vetors in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) ordinatization are onstruted as in Refs. 8 and 3, and here we

expose this onstrution one again for the sake of learness of the whole exposition. The temporal

basis vetor e0 is the unit vetor direted along the world line of the lok at the origin. The spatial

basis vetors by de(cid:28)nition onnet simultaneous events, the event (cid:17)lok at rest at the origin reads 0

time(cid:17) with the event (cid:17)lok at rest at unit distane from the origin reads 0 time,(cid:17) and thus they are

synhronization-dependent. The spatial basis vetor ei onnets two above mentioned simultaneous
events when Einstein's synhronization (ε = 1/2) of distant loks is used. The temporal basis
vetor r0 is the same as e0. The spatial basis vetor ri onnets two above mentioned simultaneous
events when (cid:17)radio(cid:17) lok synhronization (ε = 0) of distant loks is used. The spatial basis
vetors, e.g., r1, r′
1 .. are parallel and direted along an (observer-independent) light line. Hene,
two events that are everyday ((cid:17)r(cid:17)) simultaneous in S are also (cid:17)r(cid:17) simultaneous for all other IFRs.
The onnetion between the basis vetors in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) and (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatizations is given as r0 =

1, r′′

a physialy measurable tensor with the oordinate one. Thus in the approah

there are physial

and oordinate quantities for the same oordinatization of the onsidered IFR. However, in our

interpretation, his (cid:17)physialy measurable tensor(cid:17) orresponds to the tensor written in the Einstein

oordinatization of a given IFR, and the oordinate one orresponds to some arbitrary oordina-

tization of the same IFR. Thene, his matrix λµ

that the (cid:17)r(cid:17) synhronization is an assymetri synhronization whih leads to an

assymetry in the measured (cid:17)one-way(cid:17) veloity of light (for one diretion c+
r = ∞ whereas in the
opposite diretion c−
r = −c/2). The round trip veloity, however, does not depend on the hosen
synhronization proedure, and it is ≡ c. The oordinate system in whih g0i = 0 at every point

in 4D spaetime is alled time-orthogonal sine in it the time axis is everywhere orthogonal to the

spatial oordinate urves. This happens in the ases when in some IFR the Einstein synhronization

is hosen together with, e.g., artesian, or polar, or spherial, et., spatial oordinates. However

it is not the ase when the (cid:17)r(cid:17) synhronization is hosen. It has to be noted that although in the

Einstein oordinatization the spae and time omponents of the position 4-vetor do have their

usual meaning, i.e., as in the prerelativisti physis, and in ds2

e the spatial and temporal parts are

separated, it does not mean that the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization does have some advantage relative to

other oordinatizations and that the quantities in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization are more physial (for

the reent disussion of the onventionality of synhronization see Ref. 15 and referenes therein).

The laws of physis in SR obey the priniple of speial ovariane, see, e.g., Ref. 11. It says

that any physially possible set of measurements (on physial (cid:28)elds) obtained by a family, O, of
observers also is a physially possible set of measurements for another family, O′
observers O′
are obtained by (cid:17)ating(cid:17) on O with a symmetry transformation for the metri gab.
Suh transformation is alled an isometry and it does not hange gab ; if we denote an isometry as
Φ∗
then (Φ∗g)ab = gab. Thus an isometry leaves the pseudo-Eulidean geometry of 4D spaetime of
SR unhanged. An example of isometry is the ovariant 4D Lorentz transformation La
b (1). Note

, of observers. The

that the whole formulation is given without introduing or making any referene to oordinate

systems. In many treatments, it is assumed that a oordinate system has been hosen and the

tensor equations expressing physial laws have been written out in omponent form using the

oordinate basis. However, the omponent form of tensor equations is not, in general, equivalent

to the true tensor equations, but only in the ase when one oordinatization is always used, i.e.,

as ustomarily assumed, the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization. When di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations of an IFR are

allowed then the true tensor equations annot be equivalently represented by omponent form of

equations (as usually argued, e.g., Ref. 11), but they are equivalent to the CBGEs, whih ontain

both the omponents and the basis one-forms and vetors of the hosen IFR. It is also stated in Ref.

11 that if the oordinate basis is introdued the speial ovariane an be viewed as expressing the

invariane of the omponent form of equations under isometries. However, as emphasized above,

this invariane of the omponent form of equations under isometries, in fat, refers to the ase

when only one oordinatization, the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, is always used. In the more general ase,

that is onsidered in this paper, when di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations are permissible, i.e., in the (cid:17)TT

relativity,(cid:17) the speial ovariane refers either to true tensor equations or to the CBGEs. Thus the

TT are nothing else but - the isometries, and the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) is the formulation of SR in whih

physial quantities are desribed by true tensor (cid:28)elds (or by the CBGQs) that satisfy true tensor

equations (the CBGEs) representing physial laws.

When no oordinate system is introdued the isometries at diretly on tensors and that is an

'ative' point of view on transformations. However when oordinate systems are introdued an

isometry an be viewed as induing the oordinate transformation, e.g., xµ
e , but leaving
an event p and all tensors at p unhanged. This is a (cid:17)passive(cid:17) point of view on transformations.

e → xµ

′

When we use the oordinate-based geometri language then, in fat, we deal with the (cid:17)passive(cid:17)

viewpoint on transformations. In pratie these two viewpoints are equivalent. Thene we an

onsider and write that, e.g., the distane 4-vetor, the (1,0) tensor, la
the CBGQs la

r rµ′ , and that all of them represent the same physial

quantity, whih remains unhanged under the TT, i.e., under the isometries. (For the de(cid:28)nitions

of the speial ovariane, the isometries and the 'ative' and 'passive' viewpoints see Ref. 11 Ses.

2 and 4 and appendix C, and for an interesting treatment of Einstein's view of spaetime and the

modern view see Ref. 16.) Thus, in suh an interpretation, the isometries do not hange the tensor

quantities, or equivalently the CBGQs, in physial equations. This means that, in ontrast to

the invariane of form of the equations with omponents under isometries, i.e., the ovariane of

suh equations, the true tensor equations, or the CBGEs, are invariant equations under isometries.

This will be expliitly shown for di(cid:27)erent forms of the Maxwell equations in Se. 5.3. When the

only some omponents of the whole tensor quantity. In the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) suh parts of a whole

tensor quantity are onneted by the AT and they are onsidered to be the same quantity for

di(cid:27)erent observers. The examples will be given below.

3. THE TT OF THE SPACETIME LENGTH

The whole above disussion about the di(cid:27)erenes between the three approahes to SR will

be illustrated onsidering some examples, the spaetime length with its TT and the spatial and

temporal distanes with their AT.

3.1. The Spaetime Length for a Moving Rod

Let us take, for simpliity, to work in 2D spaetime. Then we also take a partiular hoie for the

4-vetor la
S and situated along the ommon x1

AB. In the usual (cid:17)3+1(cid:17) piture it orresponds to an ob jet, a rod, that is at rest in an IFR
e − axes. (Its rest length is denoted as l0.) The situation is

depited in Fig. 1, and the same example is already onsidered in Refs. 3 and 7. The deomposition

AB in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization and in S is la

AB = −βeγel0e0′ + γel0e1′, and, as mentioned

AB = l0

ee0 + l1

above,

la
AB = 0e0 + l0e1 = −βeγel0e0′ + γel0e1′

la
AB is a tensor of type (1,0) and in (6) it is written in the oordinate-based geometri language in
terms of basis vetors e0, e1, (e0′, e1′

) and the basis omponents lµ

e ) of some IFR.

e (lµ

Then we an also write the deompositions of the tensor la

AB in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) ordinatization as

la
AB = −l0r0 + l0r1 = −Kl0r0′ + (1 + βr)(1/K)l0r1′

where K = (1 + 2βr)1/2. Remark that there is l0

r 6= 0, while in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization l0

e = 0, see

bases {rµ} , {rµ′ } refer to the (cid:17)radio(cid:17) oordinatization of S and S′. la

These results an be learly understood from Fig. 1 (see also Ref. 7). We see from (6) that in the

(cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, that is ommonly used in the (cid:17)AT relativity,(cid:17) there is a dilatation of the spatial

e = l0 and not the Lorentz ontration as predited in the (cid:17)AT

AB in S and S′

is physially meaningless

in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) sine some omponents of the tensor quantity, when they are taken alone,

do not orrespond to some de(cid:28)nite 4D physial quantity. Also we remark that the whole tensor

AB omprising omponents and the basis is transformed by the Lorentz transformation
from S to S′. Note that if l0

onsider this example in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) and the situation is pitured in Fig. 2. The distane

4-vetor la

AB will be examined in two relatively moving IFRs S and S′

and in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) and (cid:17)r(cid:17)

oordinatizations, i.e., in the

eµ

, {eµ′} and {rµ} , {rµ′ } bases. The S frame is hosen to be the
rest frame of the muon. Two events are onsidered; the event A represents the reation of the muon
and the event B represents its deay after the lifetime τ0 in S. The position 4-vetors of the events
A and B in S are taken to be on the world line of a standard lok that is at rest in the origin of

4. THE AT OF SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTANCES

In this setion we onsider the same two examples as above but now from the point of view of

the onventional, i.e., Einstein's

interpretations of the spatial length of the moving rod and the

temporal distane for the moving lok.

(1)

4.1. The AT of the Spatial Distane

The AT of the spatial distane is already onsidered in the usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) approah in

Refs. 3 and 7, and therefore, here, we only quote the main results and the de(cid:28)nitions, and also

illustrate the whole onsideration by Fig. 3. The same example, a rod at rest in S, is pitured in

Fig. 1 when treated in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) and in Fig. 3 when treated in the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17) It is

mentioned in Ref. 3 that the synhronous de(cid:28)nition of the spatial length, introdued by Einstein

de(cid:28)nes length as the spatial distane between two spatial points on the (moving) ob jet measured

by simultaneity in the rest frame of the observer. In the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) the onept of sameness of

a physial quantity di(cid:27)ers from that one in the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) Indeed, in the usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17)

one takes only some basis omponents of la
) in S and
S′, then performs some additional manipulations with them, and onsiders that the onstruted
quantities represent the same physial quantity for observers in S and S′
de(cid:28)nition of the spatial length one onsiders only the omponent l1
e is taken
= 0, i.e., the spatial ends of the rod at rest in S are taken simultaneously at t = 0). Further

AB (that is, of the CBGQs lµ

e eµ (when l0

e = l0 of lµ

e eµ and lµ

e eµ′

. Thus for the Einstein's

′

one ompares it with the quantity whih is obtained in the following way; (cid:28)rst one performs the

ν′,e of the basis omponents lν

e (but not of the basis itself ) from S′

to

′

Lorentz transformation Lµ
S, whih yields

e = γel1
l1

e + γeβel1
e
e + γeβel0
e

′

Then one retains only the transformation of the spatial omponent l1
(11)) negleting ompletely the transformation of the temporal part l0

e (the seond equation in

e (the (cid:28)rst equation in (11)).

From the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) viewpoint this step of derivation is unjusti(cid:28)ed and, in fat, inorret.

Furthermore in the transformation for l1
spatial ends of the rod moving in S′

e one takes that the temporal part in S′ l0

e = 0, ( i.e., the
are taken simultaneously at some arbitrary t′ = b). Again

′

an inorret step from the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) viewpoint. The quantity obtained in suh a way will be

e = l0/γe, is the usual Lorentz ontrated spatial length, and the quantities l0 and
e = l0/γe are onsidered in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) to be the same quantity for observers in S and S′

′

.

The omparison with the relation (6) (and Fig. 3) learly shows that the onstruted quantities

′

l0 and L1
e = l0/γe are two di(cid:27)erent and independent quantities in 4D spaetime. Namely, these
quantities are obtained by the same measurements in S and S′; the spatial ends of the rod are
measured simultaneously at some te = a in S (in Fig. 3 te = tBe = tAe = 0) and also at some t′

the analogous proedure yields the relation between L1

(13)

Let us explain this result in more detail. The spatial ends of the onsidered rod, whih is at rest

in S, must be taken simultaneously in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization as well. Thus they must lie on the
light line, i.e., on the x1
r axis (that is along the spatial base vetor r1 ). The simultaneous events E
and F (whose spatial parts orrespond to the spatial ends of the rod) are the intersetions of the x1
r
axis and the world lines of the spatial ends of the rod. The events E and F are not the same events
as the events A and B, onsidered in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization for the same rod at rest in S, sine

the simultaneity of the events is de(cid:28)ned in di(cid:27)erent ways, see Fig.3. Therefore, in 4D spaetime

the spatial length in the {rµ} basis l1
e = l0 (with x0
spatial length in the {eµ} basis l1
(and in Ref. 3) one (cid:28)nds that in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization, the spatial distane l1
(with x0
r = x′1
L1

Er ) is not the same 4D quantity as the
Ae). Applying the same proedure as above
Er = l0
Er) de(cid:28)nes in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) the spatial length of the rod at rest in S, while
Gr ) de(cid:28)nes the spatial length of the moving rod in S′, see Fig. 3.

We see from (13) that there is a length dilatation ∞ ≻ L1
length (cid:17)ontration(cid:17) l0 ≻ L1

r ≻ l0 for −1/2 ≺ βr ≺ 0 and the standard
r ≻ 0 for positive βr, whih learly shows that the Lorentz (cid:17)ontration(cid:17)

′

′

is not a physially orretly de(cid:28)ned transformation. Thus, in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the same quantity

for di(cid:27)erent observers is the tensor quantity, the 4-vetor la

AB = lµ

e eµ = lµ

e eµ′ = lµ

r rµ = lµ

r rµ′ ; only

one quantity in 4D spaetime. However in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) di(cid:27)erent quantities in 4D spaetime,

the spatial distanes l1

e, L1

e , l1

r, L1

′

′

r , are onsidered as the same quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers. It

is also shown in Ref. 3 that the Lorentz (cid:17)ontration(cid:17) as the oordinate transformation hanges the

in(cid:28)nitesimal interval ds, whih de(cid:28)nes the geometry of spaetime. Thus the Lorentz ontration
is the transformation onneting di(cid:27)erent quantities in S and S′
and hanging ds, whih implies

that it is an AT.

4.2. The AT of the Temporal Distane

The same example of the (cid:17)muon deay(cid:17) will be now onsidered in the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) (see also

Ref. 7). In the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization the events A and B are again on the world line of a muon that is
at rest in S as depited in Fig. 4. We shall see one again that the onept of sameness of a physial
quantity is quite di(cid:27)erent in the (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17) There one takes only some omponents of la
(that is, of the CBGQs lµ

AB
) in S and S′, then performs some additional manipulations

e eµ and lµ

e eµ′

′

with them, and onsiders that the onstruted quantities represent the same physial quantity for

observers in two relatively moving IFRs S and S′
omponent l0
following manner; (cid:28)rst one performs the Lorentz transformation of the basis omponents lµ
not of the basis itself ) from the muon rest frame S to the frame S′

e eµ with the quantity, whih is obtained from the basis omponent l0

e = cτ0 of lµ

e in the

e (but

in whih the muon is moving.

Similarly as in the Lorentz ontration one now forgets the transformation of the spatial part l1

′

e (the

(cid:28)rst equation in (14)). This is, of ourse, an inorret step from the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) viewpoint.

the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, to de(cid:28)ne the lifetime of the moving muon in S′. The relation onneting
L0
e, whih is obtained by the above proedure, is then the well-known relation for the (cid:17)time

Ae ) in the equation for l0

This relation shows that the new quantity L0

separation in S′, where the lok is moving, is smaller - time (cid:17)ontration(cid:17) - than the temporal
separation l0
r = cτ0 in S, where the lok is at rest, for −1/2 ≺ βr ≺ 0, and it is larger - time

>From this onsideration we onlude that in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the same quantity for di(cid:27)erent

e, L0

r, L0

e , l0

and

therefore it is an AT.

The onsiderations from Ses. 4.1 and 4.2 reveal that both the Lorentz (cid:17)ontration(cid:17) and the time

(cid:17)dilatation(cid:17) are the transformations onneting di(cid:27)erent quantities (in 4D spaetime) in di(cid:27)erent

IFRs, and also they both hange the in(cid:28)nitesimal spaetime distane ds, i.e., the pseudo-Eulidean

the existing experiments. This omparison is presented in Ref. 9. It is shown there that the (cid:17)TT

relativity(cid:17) results agree with all experiments that are omplete from the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) viewpoint,

i.e., in whih all parts of the onsidered tensor quantity are measured in the experiment. However

the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) results agree only with some of the examined experiments.

5. THE AT OF THE 3-VECTORS E AND B

It is generally believed that the ovariant formulation of the eletrodynamis with F αβ
omponent form) and the usual formulation with E and B are equivalent, and therefore that the
usual transformations of E and B are atually the TT. However it is revealed in Refs. 2, 3 and
17 that the usual transformations of the 3-vetors E and B are also the AT. Here we shall present
another proofs that the onventional transformations of E and B are the AT. Furthermore it will

(the

be shown in this setion that the Maxwell equations in the 3-vetor form are not equivalent to the

Maxwell equations formulated as the true tensor equations or as the CBGEs.

5.1. The Usual Derivation of the Transformations of E and B by Using F αβ

The derivation of the usual transformations of the 3-vetors E and B whih is based on the AT

of the spatial distane, i.e., the Lorentz (cid:17)ontration(cid:17) (see, for example, Ref. 18), will be presented

at the end of Se. 5.3. Here we start with a simple derivation of the transformation relations for E
and B by using F αβ

(for similar derivation see, e.g., Ref. 10 Se. 11.10, Ref. 13 Se. 3.3.). It has to

be noted that suh onventional derivation is made using the omponent form of tensor quantities

and equations, and the omponents are determined in the spei(cid:28) oordinatization, the Einstein

oordinatization. (Beause of that we shall omit the subsript

for the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization in

′e′

the rest part of this paper, but we still denote the quantities in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization by the

subsript

′r′.) First one identi(cid:28)es, in some IFR S , the omponents Ei and Bi of the 3-vetors E

and B with some of the basis omponents of F ab

as

Ei = F 0i, Bi = (1/c)∗F 0i

in order to get in that IFR the usual Maxwell equations,

∇E(r, t) = ρ(r, t)/ε0, ∇ × E(r, t) = −∂B(r, t)/∂t
∇B(r, t) = 0, ∇ × B(r, t) = µ0j(r, t) + µ0ε0∂E(r, t)/∂t

from the ovariant Maxwell equations with F αβ

and its dual

∗F αβ

∂αF aβ = −jβ/ε0c,

∂α

∗F αβ = 0

where

is the totally skew-symmetri Levi-Civita pseudotensor.

∗F αβ = −(1/2)εαβγδFγδ and εαβγδ

The equations (19) are written in the omponent form and in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization.

After transforming by the Lorentz transformation Lµ

for basis omponents (19) to the S′

frame one (cid:28)nds

We note that we ould diretly write the equations (20) by using the following rule (see Ref. 12,

Se. 6.1): (cid:17)If an equation is formed using omponents of tensors ombined only by the permissible

tensor operations (my emphasis), and if the equation is true in one basis, then it is true in any

other.(cid:17) In this ase, if the equation (19) is valid in the {eµ} basis then it will be valid in the {eµ′ }

basis, (20), as well, sine (19) is formed ombining omponents of tensors by the permissible tensor

operations. Then, in S′, one again identi(cid:28)es the omponents Ei′
B′

with some of the basis omponents of F ab

in the same way as in S , i.e.,

and Bi′

in order to obtain in that frame the usual Maxwell equations (in the 3-vetor form) from the

transformed ovariant Maxwell equations for basis omponents. This proedure then gives the

onnetion between the quantities Ei′ , Bi′

in S′

and Ei, Bi in S as

Ei′ = Γ(Ei + cεijkβjBk) − ((Γ − 1)/β2)βi(βkEk)
Bi′ = Γ(Bi − (1/c)εijkβjEk) − ((Γ − 1)/β2)βi(βkBk)

where β = V /c and Γ = (1−β2)−1/2. When (22) is written in terms of the hosen basis omponents
of F ab, then, e.g., the (cid:28)rst equation in (22) beomes

i

F 0

= Γ(F 0i + (1/2)εijkεklmβjF lm) − ((Γ − 1)/β2)βi(βkF 0k)

The omponents of the 3-vetor (cid:28)elds E and B, and of the 3-veloity V are written with lowered

(generi) subsripts, sine they are not the spatial omponents of the 4-vetors. This refers to the

third-rank antisymmetri ε tensor too. The super- and subsripts are used only on the omponents

of the 4-vetors or tensors.

Now, from the quantities Ei, Ei′

and the basis 3-vetors in the 3D spae ei and ei′
one onstruts the eletri and magneti (cid:28)elds 3-vetors as E =Eiei, B = Biei in S and E′=Ei′ ei′ ,

B′ = Bi′ ei′

in S′. Then the equations for omponents (22) (atually the equation (23)) are written

as the relations between the 3-vetors

E′ = Γ(E + cβ × B) − ((Γ − 1)/β2)β(βE)
B′ = Γ(B − cβ × E) − ((Γ − 1)/β2)β(βB)

(24)

In Refs. 10 and 13 a little di(cid:27)erent proedure is hosen to (cid:28)nd the relation (17). In fat, they (cid:28)rst

made the identi(cid:28)ation of the basis omponents of F ab
and B, and then the relation (22) was obtained using the relations (21) and (23).

with the omponents of the 3-vetors E

An important remark is in plae already here. The identi(cid:28)ation of the omponents of the 3-

vetors E and B with some of the basis omponents of F ab, the equation (17), is not the permissible
tensor operation. This means that if the usual Maxwell equations with E and B (18), whih are
obtained by suh an operation, are true in one basis (a spei(cid:28) Lorentz frame S and the (cid:17)e(cid:17)
oordinatization), then they do not need to be true in another basis, i.e., in the S′

frame. There

is no rule inside the tensor alulus whih an guarantee that the validity of the usual Maxwell

results from the validity of the orresponding Maxwell equations (18)

equations with E′
with E and B.

and B′

(19)

Einstein's fundamental work

is the earliest referene on generally ovariant eletrodynamis

and on the identi(cid:28)ation of some omponents of F ab
) with the omponents of E
and B. He introdues an eletromagneti potential 4-vetor (in omponent form) and from this
onstruts F aβ, the omponent form of the F ab
shows that these equations orrespond to the usual Maxwell equations with E and B if he makes

(atually F αβ

tensor. Then he writes the equations (19) and

the identi(cid:28)ation given in the equations (17). It has to be mentioned that Einstein worked with the

equations for basis omponents in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization and thus not with the tensor equations,

or with the CBGEs (see Ref. 16 for the omparison of Einstein's view of spaetime and the modern

view).

5.2. The Disussion of the Usual Derivation of the Transformations of E and B from

the (cid:17)TT Relativity(cid:17) Viewpoint

Let us disuss suh onventional derivations of the relations (22) and (24) from the point

of view of the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) First of all F αβ
oordinatization and thus not well-de(cid:28)ned tensor quantitities. The tensor quantity is F ab

and F α

β

are the basis omponents in the (cid:17)e(cid:17)

or the

′

′

orresponding quantities in the oordinate-based geometri language. Then we an write the

equalities for F ab

in the same manner as in the relations for the distane 4-vetor (8), i.e., that

F ab = F αβeα ⊗ eβ = F α

eα′ ⊗ eβ′ = F αβ

frame, and in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization. The

r

β

β

, F α
r

, and the bases rα ⊗ rβ, rα′ ⊗ rβ′

, et., when taken alone, are not equal. Only the whole tensor quantity F ab

F αβ
are the basis omponents, eα,β are the basis 4-vetors, and eα ⊗ eβ is an outer produt of
the basis 4-vetors, i.e., it is the basis for (2,0) tensors, and all quantities are de(cid:28)ned in S and
in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization. Similarly holds in the S′
basis omponents F αβ
found by applying the previously mentioned transformation matrix T µ
ν,r to the orresponding
quantities in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization. The relations (25) show that the basis omponents F αβ

However in the onventional derivation of the transformations for the 3-vetors E and B, (22)
and (24), only some omponents in the spei(cid:28) oordinatization, the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, e.g., F 0i,
of the whole tensor F ab, i.e., of the F αβeα ⊗ eβ , are taken alone (see (17)), and they are argued to
represent the omponents Ei of some (cid:17)physial(cid:17) 3-vetor E. As it is emphasized above, already this

rα′ ⊗ rβ′, et., are equal quantities, i.e., they are the same 4D physial

and al l the

,

step is meaningless in the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) We also remark that from the mathematial point of view

the identi(cid:28)ations of the basis omponents F 0i
with the omponents Ei (Ei′

′
(F 0
i
) of the 3-vetor E (E′

) of F ab

(that is of F αβeα ⊗eβ (F α

eα′ ⊗eβ′

))

′

′

β

), the relations (17) ((21)), are not permissible.

15

Namely it is not possible to say that, e.g., E1 = F 01, sine the basis would also need to be inluded,
and the basis 3-vetor e1 (in 3D spae) annot be the same as the basis (2,0) tensor e0 ⊗e1. Further,
as previously mentioned, the Lorentz transformation Lµ
but also the basis eα ⊗ eβ to the basis eα′ ⊗ eβ′
an be identi(cid:28)ed with the omponents F 0
Ei′

, whene it follows that neither in S′
′
i

. In fat, the basis omponents F 0i, or F 0

ν,e (2) transforms not only F αβ

to F α

, when

′

′

the omponents

,

taken alone, are not wel l-de(cid:28)ned physial quantities in 4D spaetime.

It is interesting to note that in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) ordinatization one (cid:28)nds that, e.g.,

F 01
r = F 01 + F 12 + F 13, F 0

r = F 01 − βγ(F 02 + F 03) + γ(F 12 + F 13)

(26)

whih learly shows that the identi(cid:28)ation of the omponents of the the 3-vetors E and B with
some of the basis omponents of the tensor F ab

is a oordinatization dependent proedure and thus

unphysial.

However it is generally assumed in the usual approah (I am not aware of any exeption) that

the two sets of basis omponents of the tensor F ab
orresponding set of omponents {E1′ , E2′ , E3′ , B1′, B2′ , B3′} obtained by the identi(cid:28)ations (21))
(i.e., {E1, E2, E3, B1, B2, B3} obtained by the identi(cid:28)ations
(17)) represent the same quantity for observers in two relatively moving IFRs S and S′. But the

relations (25), and the above mentioned mathematial arguments, expliitly show that the two

when onsidered in S and S′. We an interpret these results saying that the transformations (22)
(and (24)) that onnet two mentioned sets of basis omponents of F ab
orresponding sets {E′, B′} and {E, B}) atually onnet di(cid:27)erent quantities in 4D spaetime, and

do not represent the same 4D quantity

(i.e., that onnet the

thus that they are not the TT but the AT.

It is worth noting that in many textbooks and papers on eletrodynamis the tensor F ab

and

the relations (25) and (26) are never mentioned, and almost always only the basis omponents (in

of the tensor F ab

or paper on eletrodynamis F αβ
the omponents of the 3-vetors E and B (see, e.g., Ref. 13 h. 3, pp. 73,74, Ref. 10 Se.
11.9). This means that E and B are onsidered as primary quantities while F αβ
seondary quantity determined by the omponents of E and B. But, even if one works only in the

(the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization) is written as that its omponents are

is in some way a

(cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, and onsiders only the ovariant Maxwell equations for basis omponents (19)

(thus not the true tensor equation with F ab
to take that F αβ
or the orresponding wave equation ∂σ∂σFαβ − (1/ε0c)(∂βjα − ∂αjβ) = 0, and it onveys all the
information about the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld. The solution F αβ

is the primary quantity; it is the solution of the ovariant Maxwell equations (19),

) it is more orret, from the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) viewpoint,

(in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization and in

the retarded formulation) of these equations is given as

F αβ(xµ) = (2k/iπc)

de(cid:28)ned quantity in the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) We see that there is no need to introdue Ei and Bi,
and, in fat, to de(cid:28)ne F αβ
omponents F αβ

determined by the above expression for F αβ(xµ).

by the relations (17) and (21), but one an work exlusively with the

5.3. Nonequivalene of the Maxwell Equations in the 3-Vetor Form and in the Form

of Tensor Equations

The usual ovariant Maxwell equations (19) are atually the equations in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordina-

tization for basis omponents in a hosen IFR. We (cid:28)rst show how these equations for the basis

omponents are derived from the true tensor equations (when no basis has been introdued). The

true tensor equations an be written in the abstrat index notation as

∇aFab = −jb/ε0c,

εabcd∇bFcd = 0

(27)

16

where ∇b is the derivative operator (sometimes alled the ovariant derivative), see, e.g., Ref. 11.

The tensor equation (27) an be written in the following form

(−g)−1/2∂a((−g)1/2F ab) = −jb/ε0c,

εabcd∂bFcd = 0

(28)

where g is the determinant of the metri tensor gab and ∂a is an ordinary derivative operator. When
some oordinatization is hosen in an IFR S , e.g., the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, then the relations (28)

an be written in the oordinate-based geometri language as the equations that ontain the basis

vetors as well,

∂αF aβeβ = −(1/ε0c)jβeβ,

∂α

∗F αβeβ = 0

(29)

(We remark that (29) follows from (28) for those oordinatizations for whih the basis vetors are

onstant, e.g., (cid:17)e(cid:17) and (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatizations onsidered here. For a nononstant basis, for example,

when one uses polar or spherial basis one forms and vetors (and (cid:17)e(cid:17) or (cid:17)r(cid:17) synhronization) then

one must also di(cid:27)erentiate these nononstant basis vetors.) From (29), whih ontain the basis

(1,0) tensors (4-vetors), one (cid:28)nds the already written equations for basis omponents (19); every

equation in (29) is the equality of two tensors of the same type, two 4-vetors, and if two 4-vetors

are equal then the orresponding omponents are equal, and that holds in all bases.

In many

treatments only the ovariant Maxwell equations (19) for the basis omponents are used forgetting

that they are obtained from the tensor equations (28) or (29). Then, with substitutions (17), one

(cid:28)nds the equations for the quantities Ei and Bi

∂iEi = ρ/ε0,
∂iBi = 0,

εijk∂jEk = −c∂0Bi

εijk∂jBk = µ0ji + µ0ε0c∂0Ei

(30)

>From the quantities Ei and Bi and the basis 3-vetors in 3D spae ei one onstruts the eletri
and magneti (cid:28)elds 3-vetors as E =Eiei, B = Biei in S. Then the equations for the quantities Ei
and Bi (30) are written as the usual Maxwell equations for the 3-vetors E and B (18). This is

obviously a very awkward proedure; we started from the equation (29) with the basis vetors in

4D spaetime and ended in the equation (18) with the basis vetors in 3D spae. One an form an

equation with the omponents of tensors if these omponents are ombined only by the permissible

tensor operations. The usual Maxwell equations (30) are not obtained by suh permissible tensor

operations with the omponents of tensors sine the identi(cid:28)ations (17) are not suh operations.

Furthermore the Maxwell equations (18) ontain the 3-vetors E and B, and these 3-vetors are
onstruted in an arti(cid:28)al way from some basis omponents of the tensor F αβeα ⊗ eβ and the basis
3-vetors ei of the 3D spae. The matematial equivalene between the equations with the basis

3-vetors and the equations with the basis 4-vetors annot exist. Thene we an onlude that

the usual Maxwel l equations with Ei and Bi (30), or with the 3-vetors E and B (18), are not

equivalent to the tensor equations (28), i.e., to the CBGEs (29).

If one uses the (cid:17)r(cid:17) ordinatization then from the tensor equation (28) one (cid:28)nds a similar equation

to (29) but now in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization,

∂αrF aβ

r eβr = −(1/ε0c)jβ

r eβr,

∂αr

∗F αβ

r eβr = 0

Note that in IFRs g is onstant and g = −1. From these equations (31), whih ontain the

basis vetors, and whih are ompletely equivalent in the desription of physial phenomena to the

orresponding equations in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization (29), one naturally (cid:28)nds the equations for basis

omponents

∂αrF aβ

r = −(1/ε0c)jβ
r ,

∂αr

∗F αβ

r = 0

Let us perform the similar identi(cid:28)ations of some of the basis omponents of F ab
Eir and Bir, orresponding in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization to the quantities Ei and Bi in the (cid:17)e(cid:17)

with the quantities

oordinatization. Then, as an be seen from the relations (26), one wil l not get from (32) the

equations of the same form as the orresponding equations in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization (30). This

is aused by the fat that the identi(cid:28)ations of some of the basis omponents of the tensor F ab

with the omponents of the 3-vetors are not the permissible tensor operations. Of ourse, if

one introdues the basis 3-vetors ri in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization in 3D spae, and onstruts the
3-vetors Er=Eirri and Br = Birri, then the 3-vetors in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization and in the (cid:17)e(cid:17)

(31)

(32)

17

oordinatization are not equal, i.e., Er 6= E and Br 6= B. The obtained equations with Er and Br
are not of the same form as the usual Maxwell equations with E and B (18). This additionally

proves that the Maxwell equations with the 3-vetors are not equivalent to the Maxwell equations

in tensor form (28), or (29), or (31).

In the {eµ′} basis the relation (28) beomes

whih then gives the equation for basis omponents (20). Again, by the same reasoning as above

(after the relation (30)), we onlude that the usual Maxwell equations in the S′
and B′
Ei′

, or with the 3-vetors E′

and Bi′

, are not equivalent to the tensor equations (28), that

frame, i.e., with

is, to the CBGEs (33).

In addition to the omparison of the tensor Maxwell equations (the CBGEs) with the Maxwell

equations in the 3-vetor form we also investigate the relation of the tensor Maxwell equations and

the equations with the basis omponents. Some important onlusions will be derived regarding the

mathematial form of the physial laws in the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) From the mathematial viewpoint

the (1,0) tensor quantity (−g)−1/2∂a((−g)1/2F ab) an be written in the oordinate-based geomet-
ri language in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) ordinatization, and in S as ∂αF aβeβ, while in S′

all primed quantities (inluding the basis vetors) are obtained by the TT, i.e., by the Lorentz

oordinatization; the quantities in the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization an be determined from the orrespond-

ing quantities in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization using the previously mentioned transformation matrix

whih shows that the equalities in (34) refer to the same quantity in 4-D spaetime. Analogously,

the mathematis yields for the (1,0) tensor (4-vetor) −jb/ε0c the relations

− jb/ε0c = −(1/ε0c)jβeβ = −(1/ε0c)jβ

A similar analysis an be applied to the seond Maxwell equation in (28). The physial

laws

expressed as tensor equations, e.g., (28), or equivalently as CBGEs, for example, (29), (33) and (31),

set up the onnetion between two geometri quantities, in this ase, two 4-vetors, that are given

by equations (34) and (35). The experiments in whih al l parts of tensor quantities are measured

then play the fundamental role in deiding about the validity of some physial law mathematial ly

expressed as tensor equation. We see from the equations (34) and (35) that when the physial laws

are expressed as tensor, geometri, equations (28), (29), (33) and (31), (or, in other words, when

the transformations that onnet relatively moving IFRs, and di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations of the

hosen IFR, are all the TT), then these equations are invariant upon the Lorentz transformations

and the transformations T µ

ν (4) between di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations. It is not so for the equations

in the omponent form, e.g., (19), (20), (32). First, one annot write suh equalities, (34) and (35),

for the basis omponents alone. Although, for example, the quantity ∂αF aβ
for the basis omponents (19) is of the same form as ∂α′F a
replaing the unprimed ones, these quantities ∂αF aβ

and ∂α′F a

from (20), with primed quantities

are not equal. When they are

from the equations

taken without the basis vetors then they are not the same 4D quantity. Further, one sees that for

the equations with the basis omponents only the form of equations remains unhanged under the

Lorentz transformations and the transformations T µ

ν (4), i.e., suh equations are ovariant but not

invariant. Of ourse the ovariane of physial equations, when they are written in the omponent

form, is a simple onsequene of the invariane of tensor quantities, or equivalently, of the CBGQs,

upon the mentioned TT, that is upon the isometries. The invariane of physial laws, that are

expressed as tensor equations, or equivalently as the CBGEs, means that al l physial phenomena

proeed in the same way (taking into aount the orresponding initial and boundary onditions)

in di(cid:27)erent IFRs. Thus there is no physial di(cid:27)erene between these frames, what automatial ly

embodies the priniple of relativity. We remark that in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) there is no need to

postulate the priniple of relativity as a fundamental law. It is replaed by the requirement that

the physial laws must be expressed as tensor equations (or equivalently as the CBGEs) in the 4D

spaetime.

18

The above onsideration shows that the Maxwell equations in the 3-vetor form are not equiv-

alent to the Maxwell equations when written as tensor equations, or as CBGEs. But, in addition,

we expliitly show that the Maxwell equations in the 3-vetor form are not the ovariant equations,

i.e., that their form do not remain unhanged when they are transformed by the Lorentz transfor-

. It is the onsequene of the fat that the transformations of the 3-vetors

mation from S to S′
E and B, the relations (24), are the AT, whih do not refer to the same 4D quantities. When the
Lorentz transformations (2), as the TT (in 4D spaetime), are applied to the basis omponents xµ,
∂µ and jµ
in the usual Maxwell equations for the quantities Ei and Bi (30) and the AT (22) are
applied to Ei and Bi then we (cid:28)nd

∂i′ Ei′ = ρ′/ε0 − Vi [εijk∂j′ Bk′ − µ0ji′ − µ0ε0c∂0′ Ei′ ]

εijk∂j′ Ek′ = −c∂0′Bi′ + Vi [∂j′ Bj′ ]

∂i′ Bi′ = (Vi/c2) [εijk∂j′ Ek′ + c∂0′Bi′ ]

εijk∂j′ Bk′ = µ0ji′ + µ0ε0c∂0′ Ei′ − (Vi/c2) [∂i′ Ei′ − ρ′/ε0]

(36)

Obviously the Maxwell equations (36) in S′

do not have the same form as in S (30). Note that

if the fourth relation from (36) was introdued into the (cid:28)rst relation from (36) then one obtains

(∂i′ Ei′ − ρ′/ε0)(1 − V 2/c2) = 0 and similarly for other relations. For V 6= c one (cid:28)nally (cid:28)nds the
as it is in S, i.e., ∂i′ Ei′ − ρ′/ε0 = 0. But di(cid:27)erent manipulations
same form for the Gauss law in S′
were needed to ahieve the same form of laws in S′
as in S. (The result (36) has been already

presented in Ref. 17.)

The same result as (36) was mentioned in Ref. 13 Se.3.4. but there it was obtained and inter-

preted in a di(cid:27)erent way. We disuss that derivation in order to show some important di(cid:27)erenes

between the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) and the usual approah to speial relativity. In Ref. 13 they start with

the Gauss law for the magneti (cid:28)eld in the 3-vetor form (all is done in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization)

in a spei(cid:28) IFR S, i.e., ∇B = ∂iBi = 0. Then the priniple of relativity is used in a way that is
usual in the onventional (cid:17)AT relativity.(cid:17) They asserts that the statement ∇B = 0 : (cid:17)has to be
true in all Lorentz frames,(cid:17) and hene they write this equation in some relatively moving IFR S′
as ∂i′ Bi′ = 0. In suh usual approah the priniple of relativity is understood as a fundamental

postulate aording to whih any physial law (cid:17)has to be true in all Lorentz frames,(cid:17) and the Gauss

law in the 3-vetor form ∇B = 0 is onsidered to be a physial law. Note that suh an under-

standing of the priniple of relativity does not exist in the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) There, as shown above,

it is required that the physial laws must be expressed as tensor equations (or equivalently as the

CBGEs) in the 4D spaetime. The invariane of physial laws upon the TT automatially follows

from suh formulation. The relations between the 3-vetors annot be the physial laws that hold

in 4D spaetime, sine suh relations wil l neessarily hange their form upon the Lorentz trans-

formation, whih are the transformations de(cid:28)ned on 4D spaetime. Let us see how suh hanges

neessarily appear in the onsidered derivation in Ref. 13 Se.3.4., and how they are interpreted.

The authors of

(13)

ontinue the derivation substituting the usual transformations of Ei′

and Bi′

(22) and the Lorentz transformations of ∂µ′ ≡ ∂/∂xµ
fat, they simpli(cid:28)ed the derivation taking that β ≪ 1, i.e., that γ = 1. However suh simpli(cid:28)ation

into the Gauss law ∂i′ Bi′ = 0 in S′

. (In

′

is unneessary and the omplete Lorentz transformations and the transformations (22) lead to the

same result.) Now omes an interesting point whih niely illustrates how some problems, obviously

appearing in the approah with the 3-vetors, are arti(cid:28)ially avoided and even wrongly interpreted.

After the mentioned substitutions it is stated in Ref. 13: (cid:17)Reover the original ondition of zero

divergene in the laboratory frame, plus the following additional information (requirement for the

vanishing of the oe(cid:30)ient of the arbitrary small veloity β ):

∂Bx/∂t + ∂Ez/∂y − ∂Ey/∂z = 0”

Thus they started with ∂i′ Bi′ = 0, then performed the transformations and (cid:28)nally they obtained
the following relation ∂iBi − (V /c2) [ε1jk∂jEk + c∂0B1] = 0, sine they hose that the veloity
of transformation been direted in the x− diretion. This is exatly our relation (36) (the third

equation, but for the reversed transformation). We derived (36) using the Lorentz transformations

(2) and the transformations of Ei′
(22), whih hold not only for V ≪ c but for any V ≺ c.
Hene it follows that it is not possible to put into the equation ∂iBi −(V /c2) [ε1jk∂jEk + c∂0B1] = 0

and Bi′

19

that ε1jk∂jEk + c∂0B1 = 0 as done in Ref. 13 (cid:17)(requirement for the vanishing of the oe(cid:30)ient
of the arbitrary small veloity β );(cid:17) the veloity does not need to be arbitrary small. Simply they

obtained the ontradition; they started from the assertion that the Gauss law for the magneti

(cid:28)eld in the 3-vetor form must have the same form in all Lorentz frames (the generally aepted

formulation of the priniple of relativity) and found by applying the Lorentz transformations and

the usual transformations of Ei and Bi (22) that it is not true. The above disussion in this setion

reveals that there are two reasons for the hanges of form of the usual Maxwell equations in the

3-vetor form. The (cid:28)rst reason is the traditional formulation of the priniple of relativity in whih

this priniple ats as the postulate established outside the mathematial formulation of the theory.

In ontrast to this in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the equivalene of all Lorentz frames in the desription of

the physial phenomena naturally follows, as already said, from the formulation of physial laws

as tensor equations, or equivalently as the CBGEs. The seond reason is the use of the (cid:17)apparent

transformations(cid:17) of Ei and Bi (22).

When Einstein

(1)

derived the transformations of the 3-vetors E and B, the relations (24) or

(22), he made it using the priniple of relativity as a postulate and using the Maxwell equations in

the 3-vetor form. Let us disuss his derivation of (24). Einstein worked with the Maxwell equations

(18) (thus in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization) and (cid:28)rst he performed the Lorentz transformations of the

derivatives from an IFR S (he denoted it as K ) to another IFR S′
(k in his notation) moving with
V relative to S . In the ourse of that derivation he ombined di(cid:27)erent Maxwell equations and, for
example, he found ∂0′ Ei from the Ampère-Maxwell law, the last relation in (18), and inserted it
into the Gauss law for E, the (cid:28)rst relation in (18). This is an important step in the derivation.

But, stritly speaking, suh a ombination of the transformation relations for di(cid:27)erent equations

(physial laws) is not, in fat, allowed, sine one (cid:28)rst has to know how every law (separately) will

look like in another IFR. Then, after regrouping di(cid:27)erent terms, e.g., in Gauss's law, so that the

equations have the same form in S′

as in the original frame S , he used the priniple of relativity,

Ref. 1 p.52: (cid:17)Now the priniple of relativity requires that if the Maxwell-Hertz equations for empty

spae hold good in system K , they also hold good in system k , .. .(cid:17) This led him to the relations
(22) for Ei and Bi . But, as we see from (36) and from the disussion of the derivation given in

Ref. 13, the Maxwell equations in the 3-vetor form do not remain unhanged when the Lorentz

transformations (2) are applied to the derivatives ∂µ and the transformations (22) are applied to
Ei and Bi. Hene the same ob jetions and remarks hold for this Einstein's derivation of (22) as we

onsidered above for Ref. 13.

We an onlude from the whole disussion that the Maxwell equations in the 3-vetor form

(18), or equivalently (30) (always only in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization), are neither ovariant (they

hange their form when going from an IFR S to another relatively moving IFR S′

), nor are they

equivalent to the tensor Maxwell equations (28), or to the CBGEs (29), (33), (31).

It is also remarked in Ref. 20 that the 3-vetor form of the Maxwell equations in a noninertial

frame is not unique, but it depends on whih omponents of the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld tensor (on-

travariant, ovariant, mixed) one uses to identify them with the omponents of the eletri and

magneti 3-vetors. In a omment

on

it is explained that there is not any real ambiguity in

(21)

(20)

de(cid:28)ning eletri and magneti 3-vetor (cid:28)elds in noninertial and urved spaetimes if one introdues

the eletri Ea

and magneti Ba

4-vetor (cid:28)elds instead of the usual 3-vetor (cid:28)elds. Our onsid-

eration revealed that in IFRs the Maxwel l equations in the 3-vetor form (18) are not equivalent

to the tensor Maxwel l equations (28), whih means that the introdution of the eletri Ea
magneti Ba
eletrodynamis in IFRs with the basis omponents of the 4-vetors Ea

and Ba

4-vetor (cid:28)elds is neessary in IFRs as wel l. The ovariant formulation of vauum

is onsidered in

and

Refs. 2 and 3 and here we shall derive some important results in a more general manner.

Before doing it we onsider another derivation of (22) or (24), whih is presented in, e.g., the

(18)

well-known textbook,

and whih expliitly uses the Lorentz (cid:17)ontration(cid:17) (12). From the (cid:17)TT

relativity(cid:17) viewpoint suh derivation diretly shows that the transformations of the 3-vetors E
and B (24) (or (22)) are the AT. Here we disuss some important steps and results in Purell's

derivation. First Purell derives the expressions for the harge and urrent densities (for example,

the relations (53) and (54) in Se. 6 in Ref. 18) assuming that the speial relativity requires the

Lorentz (cid:17)ontration,(cid:17) e.g., of the moving harge sheets in Fig. 5.9, or of the distane between

moving positive ions in Fig. 5.20 in Ref. 18. Then he impliitly deals with the onventional

Eq. (3) Se. 5 in Ref. 18. The whole above disussion and all ob jetions to the de(cid:28)nition of harge

by means of the volume integral of the harge density exatly apply to this de(cid:28)nition of Q in terms
of the (cid:29)ux of the 3-vetor E. In fat, the same ob jetions hold also for al l Maxwel l's equations in

the 3-vetor form when they are written in the integral form. Further it is formulated in Ref. 18

(cid:17)a formal statement of the relativisti invariane of harge(cid:17) by Eq. (4) Se. 5

and it is laimed there that: (cid:17)Eah of the surfae integrals in Eq. 4 is to be evaluated at one instant

′

in the moving frame F ′
ν,e from the orresponding quantities in the frame F . Atually, as said

in its frame.(cid:17) Again we note that t′, S′, and da′
Lorentz transformation Lµ
above, t′
S by the Lorentz (cid:17)ontration,(cid:17) see, e.g., Se. 5.5 in Ref. 18. Thus the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) de(cid:28)nition
of a harge Q by the (cid:29)ux of E annot be relativistially orret de(cid:28)nition either. Consequently
the above equality of (cid:29)uxes of E in F and F ′

is an arbitrary time in F ′

and the surfae S′

(Eq. (4) Se. 5 in Ref. 18) has nothing to do with

is onsidered to be obtained from the surfae

are not obtained by the

the relativisti invariane of harge upon the Lorentz transformation. In addition we mention that

Purell, in the same way as many others, treats the transformation of the fore as the AT and not

as the TT (in this ase the Lorentz transformation). Namely, as an be seen from Eq. (23) Se.5

in Ref. 18, only some spatial omponents of the 4-fore are ompared in F and F ′
whole 4-vetor. Furthermore the expressions for the (cid:28)elds E and B, e.g., Eqs. (55) and (56) Se.

and not the

6 in Ref. 18, are determined invoking the postulate of relativity. But that postulate is understood

in the same sense as we disussed above in onnetion with Einstein's derivation of (24) and in

the mentioned example from,

i.e., in a typial (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) manner. Sine in Ref. 18 the

transformations of E and B are obtained by using the AT of di(cid:27)erent quantities, and also using

di(cid:27)erent de(cid:28)nitions whih ontain suh transformations, it is lear that the transformations (24)

(or (22)) are the AT as well.

The whole proedure and the results an be interpreted from the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) viewpoint.

The urrent-density 4-vetor jµ
determined from the jµeµ 4-vetor in the rest frame of the harges, in a similar manner as in Ref.

eµ′

in the moving frame (all is in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization) has to be

3 (but there the quantities were written only in the omponent form). Thus in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17)

(13)

′

21

approah one has to use the Lorentz transformation Lµ
ν,e instead of the Lorentz (cid:17)ontration(cid:17).
Further, the total eletri harge Q in a three-dimensional hypersurfae H (with two-dimensional
boundary δH ) is de(cid:28)ned by the tensor equation

′

QδH = (1/c)

jatadH

ZH

where ta is the unit normal to H , see, e.g., Ref. 11 h. 4 and Ref. 3. The Gauss law in the integral
form an be also written as the tensor equation using the eletri 4-vetor (cid:28)eld Ea

(see the next

setion, Eq. (39) ) as

(1/c)

jatadH = ε0

EanadA

ZH

ZδH

where the integral on the right hand side of (38) is the integral of the normal omponent of Ea
on δH , see Ref. 11. (Wald uses suh form of Gauss's law in urved spaetime but our disussion

shows that suh form has to be used in (cid:29)at spaetime, and partiularly in IFRs, as well.) The

relativisti invariane of harge automatially follows from the de(cid:28)nition (37) or (38). In an (cid:17)in-

variant(cid:17) approah to the SR, i.e., in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) the de(cid:28)nitions (37) and (38) replae the

above quoted usual de(cid:28)nitions of Q in terms of the volume integral of harge density and by means
of the (cid:29)ux of the 3-vetor E.

6. COVARIANT ELECTRODINAMICS WITH Ea

and Ba

In aordane with the disussion in the previous setion we introdue the 4-vetors Ea
Ba
(see also Refs. 11, 21 and 22) instead of the usual 3-vetors E and B, in order to formulate
the Maxwell equations as tensor equations with Ea
and Ba, whih will be equivalent to the tensor
Maxwell equations (27), (28), with F ab. Then we de(cid:28)ne the eletri and magneti (cid:28)eld by the

and

relations

Ea = (1/c)Fabvb, Ba = −(1/2c2)εabcdvbFcd

(39)

is the totally skew-symmetri

are the eletri and magneti (cid:28)eld 4-vetors measured by an observer moving with

and Ba

in an arbitrary referene frame, vava = −c2, and εabcd

The Ea
4-veloity va
Levi-Civita pseudotensor (density). These (cid:28)elds satisfy the onditions vaEa = vbBb, whih follow
from the de(cid:28)nitions (39) and the antisymmetry of Fab. In the usual treatments (see, e.g., Refs. 11,
22 and 21) the tensors Ea
but at the same time the usual Maxwell equations with the 3-vetors E and B are onsidered
to be valid in the IFRs. One gets the impression that Ea
mathematial ob jets, while the real physial meaning is assoiated with the 3-vetors E and B.
Our results obtained in the preeding setions imply that it is neessary to use the 4-vetors Ea
and Ba
meaning and not the 3-vetors E and B. The inverse relation onneting the Ea, Ba
Fab is

in IFRs as well. This means that the tensor quantities Ea

and Ba

and Ba

and Ba

are introdued in the urved spaetimes or noninertial frames,

are onsidered only as useful

do have the real physial

and the tensor

Fab = (1/c)(vaEb − vbEa) + εabcdvcBd

(40)

The tensor Maxwell equations with Ea, Ba

in the urved spaetimes are derived in Ref. 22. Here we

speify them to the IFRs, but in suh a way that they remain valid for di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations

of the hosen IFR. First we write the tensor Maxwell equations (28) with F ab
(29) ∂αF aβeβ = −(1/ε0c)jβeβ,

∗F αβeβ = 0. Then we also write the equation (40) in the

∂α

as the CBGEs

oordinate-based geometri language and the obtained equation substitute into (29) (all is done in

the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization). This proedure yields

∂α(δαβ

µνvµEν + cεαβµνBµvν )eβ = −(jβ/ε0)eβ

∂α(δαβ

µνvµBν + (1/c)εαβµνvµEν )eβ = 0

(41)

and Bα

measured by a family of observers moving with 4-veloity vα

are the basis omponents of the eletri and magneti (cid:28)eld 4-vetors Ea
νδβ

where Eα
Ba
equations (41) orrespond in the Ea, Ba

µδβ
piture to the equations (29) in the F ab

, and δαβ

µν = δα

ν − δα

and

µ. The

piture. From

22

the relations (41) we again (cid:28)nd the ovariant Maxwell equations for the basis omponents (without

the basis vetors eβ ), whih were already presented in Refs. 2 and 3

∂α(δαβ

µν vµEν + cεαβµνBµvν) = −(jβ/ε0)

∂α(δαβ

µν vµBν + (1/c)εαβµνvµEν) = 0

(42)

(It has to be mentioned that the equations (42) were also presented in Ref. 23 but with jβ = 0.
However in Ref. 23 the physial meaning of vα
reason for suh hoie of vα
(cid:28)elds,(cid:17) while E and B are onsidered as the physial (cid:28)elds. In our (cid:17)invariant(cid:17) approah with Ea
and Ba
and Ba
de(cid:28)ned and measured in 4D spaetime, while the 3-vetors E and B are not orretly de(cid:28)ned in

the situation is just the opposite; Ea

in Ref. 23 is that there Eα

and Bα

is unspei(cid:28)ed - it is any unitary 4-vetor. The

are the real physial (cid:28)elds, whih are orretly

are introdued as the (cid:17)auxiliary

4D spaetime from the (cid:17)TT viewpoint.(cid:17)) The equations (42) for basis omponents orrespond to

the ovariant Maxwell equations for basis omponents (19), and the whole disussion from the

preeding setion about the equations with F ab, i.e., the CBGEs (29) and the equations for basis
omponents (19), an be easily translated to the equations with Ea
and Ba, (41) and (42). Instead
of to work with F ab
with (41) and (42). For the given soures ja
solutions for Ea

- formulation, (29) and (19), one an equivalently use the Ea, Ba

and Ba.

one ould solve these equations and (cid:28)nd the general

formulation

6.1. The Lorentz Fore in Terms of Ea

and Ba

To omplete the formulation of eletrodynamis with Ea

and Ba

for the Lorentz fore in terms of Ea
motion of a harge q moving in the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld Ea
be written in terms of F ab
be noted that usually the real physial meaning is not attributed to F ab
B. In the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) only the 4D tensor quantities F ab, or Ea

as K a = (q/c)F abub where ub

and Ba, Ref. 17. The Lorentz fore an
is the 4-veloity of a harge q . It has to
but to the 3-vetors E and
and Ba, do have wel l-de(cid:28)ned

and Ba

(see, e.g., Refs. 21 and 17) and also the equation of

one an write the expression

physial meaning both in the theory and in experiments. Thene we express the Lorentz fore in

terms of the 4-vetors Ea
di(cid:27)erent from va
and the observer have distint world lines, K a
the va

-orthogonal omponent, K a

⊥ , and va

and Ba. In the general ase of an arbitrary spaetime and when ua

is

(the 4-veloity of an observer who measures Ea

and Ba

an be written in terms of Ea

and Ba

as a sum of

), i.e. when the harge

the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) only both omponents together do have a physial meaning and they de(cid:28)ne the

of SR one an use di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations of an IFR. Thene, in general, the derivatives of

the nononstant basis vetors must be also taken into aount, e.g., if one uses the (cid:17)e(cid:17) or (cid:17)r(cid:17)

synhronization and polar or spherial spatial oordinate basis. Therefore the use of the ovariant

4-vetors Ea
omparison with the usual 3-vetor form of the Lorentz fore F = qE + q(v × B) is onsidered in

are determined by the expression for K a

and Ba

and Newton's seond law (46). The

Ref. 17 and will be reported in more detail elsewhere.

6.2. The Comparison of Maxwell's Equations with E and B and Those with Ea
Ba

and

The omparison of this (cid:17)invariant(cid:17) approah with Ea

and Ba

and the usual nonovariant ap-

proah with the 3-vetors E and B is possible in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization, see also Ref. 17. If one
onsiders the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization and takes that in an IFR S the observers who measure the basis
are at rest, i.e., vα = (c, 0), then E0 = B0 = 0, and one an derive from
omponents Eα
the ovariant Maxwell equations (42) for the basis omponents Eα
whih ontain only the spae parts Ei
of Eα
equation in (42) one easily (cid:28)nds ∂iEi = j0/ε0c. We see that the Maxwell equations obtained in

and Bα

and Bα

and Bα

and Bi

, e.g., from the (cid:28)rst ovariant Maxwell

the Maxwell equations

suh a way from the Maxwell equations (41), or (42), are of the same form as the usual Maxwell

equations with E and B. From the above onsideration one onludes that all the results obtained
in a given IFR S from the usual Maxwell equations with E and B remain valid in the formulation
with the 4-vetors Ea
the (cid:28)elds Ea
and Ba
of E and B, whih are not well de(cid:28)ned quantities in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) an be simply replaed by
the spae omponents of the 4-vetors Ea

and Ba

and Ba

and are at rest in the onsidered IFR. Then for suh observers the omponents

(in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization), but only for the observers who measure

(in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization). It has to be noted

that just suh observers were usually onsidered in the onventional formulation with the 3-vetors

moving with V α

E and B. However, the observers who are at rest in some IFR S annot remain at rest in another
this simple replaement does not hold; in S′
IFR S′
and B′
one annot obtain the usual Maxwell equations with the 3-vetors E′
and Bα
AT (22)) from the transformed ovariant Maxwell equations with Eα

relative to S . Hene in S′

(determined by the

.

Some important experimental onsequenes of the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) approah have been derived

in Ref. 3. They are the existene of the spatial omponents Ei
ondutor for the observers (who measure Ea

of Ea

) at rest in the rest frame of the wire, and the existene

outside a urrent-arrying

of opposite (invariant) harges on opposite sides of a square loop with urrent, both when the loop

is at rest and when it is moving.

6.3. The Covariant Ma jorana Form of Maxwell's Equations

We note that it is possible to write the Maxwell equations for Ea

and Ba

in another form, the

ovariant Ma jorana form, whih is better suited for the transition to the quantum physis. This

an be realized by introduing the ovariant Ma jorana eletromagneti (cid:28)eld

Ψa = Ea − icBa

Then the ovariant Ma jorana form of Maxwell's equations in the oordinate-based geometri lan-

in the understanding of the physial meaning of Ea

and Ba, and thene of Ψa, in Ref. 23 and

(23)

in our approah (note also that

exlusively deals with the basis omponents in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordi-

natization). From the Maxwell equations for the free eletromagneti (cid:28)eld (51) one diretly gets

one-photon quantum equation interpreting Ψα

as the one-photon wave funtion and introduing

the probability urrent and the ontinuity equation as in Ref. 23.

It an be seen from the reent literature that there is an inreasing interest in a photon wave

funtion, one-photon quantum equation and in photon loalizability, see, e.g., Refs. 24-26 and

referenes therein. The ommon point for all these works is that they use the omplex (cid:28)eld Ψ as a
linear ombination of the eletri and magneti 3-vetors E and B, Ψ = E − icB, as in the original

Ma jorana idea. An unavoidable step in suh treatments is that when one wants to (cid:28)nd the relation

between the photon wave equation and the usual Maxwell equations in the 3-vetor form then one

needs to get rid of the Plank onstant. In our invariant approah with Ea, Ba

and Ψa

there is no

need for suh step. Furthermore it is onsidered as one of the advantages of the use of the omplex

eletromagneti 3-vetor Ψ that the energy density of the lassial eletromagneti (cid:28)eld is equal to
the square of the norm of that vetor Ψ. Ψ∗Ψ is thus interpreted as being diretly proportional to
the probability density funtion for a photon. In the tensor formulation with Ea, Ba
needs to use the ovariant expression for the energy-momentum density tensor T ab
(8) in Ref. 2 with Eα
atually the basis omponents in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization of the tensor T ab

, or the equation (53) in Ref. 23 with Ψα; both expressions are

and Bα

and Ψa

) instead of the usual

(the equation

one

expressions for the energy and momentum densities of the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld (with the 3-vetors

E, B and Ψ). We shall not further disuss the ovariant Ma jorana formulation sine it will be

reported elsewhere.

7. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have presented an invariant (true tensor) formulation, the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17)

formulation, of SR. As stated in Se. 2, the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) is the formulation of SR in whih

physial quantities in the 4D spaetime are mathematially represented by true tensor (cid:28)elds (when

no basis has been introdued) that satisfy true tensor equations representing physial laws. When

some basis has been introdued the physial quantities are desribed by the CBGQs, whih ontain

both the omponents and the basis one-forms and vetors of the hosen IFR, and whih satisfy the

CBGEs. It is also shown in Se. 2 that from the mathematial viewpoint the TT are the isometries.

These fats enable to treat di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations of an IFR in the same manner. Two very

di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations, the (cid:17)e(cid:17) and (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatizations, are exposed in Se. 2 and exploited

throughout the paper. The (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) is ompared with the usual ovariant approah to SR

and with the usual (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) formulation, i.e., with the original Einstein's formulation. In the

usual ovariant approah one deals with the basis omponents of tensors and with the equations of

physis written out in the omponent form, and all is mainly done in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization. In

the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) one does not deal with tensor quantities but with quantities from (cid:17)3+1(cid:17) spae

and time, e.g., the synhronously determined spatial lengths, or the temporal distanes. The AT

onnet suh quantities and thus they refer exlusively to the omponent form of tensor quantities

and in that form they transform only some omponents of the whole tensor quantity.

The prinipal onept that makes distintion between the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) formulation, the

usual ovariant formulation and the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) formulation of SR is the onept of sameness

of a physial quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers. In the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the same quantity for di(cid:27)erent

observers is the true tensor quantity, or equivalently the CBGQ, only one quantity in 4D spaetime.

The examples of suh quantities are the spaetime length l (3), Ses. 2 and 3, the distane 4-vetor
la
AB (6) and (7) and Fig. 1 in Se. 3.1, and (9) and (10) and Fig. 2 in Se. 3.2. All these quantities
are mathematially equal la
r rµ′ , (8) in Se. 2, and thus they are

e eµ′ = lµ

e eµ = lµ

r rµ = lµ

AB = lµ

′

′

really the same quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers. Note that these quantities are onneted by the

TT, the Lorentz transformation La
transformation T µ
formulation of SR one onsiders that the basis omponents, e.g., lµ
e and lµ
quantity for di(cid:27)erent observers. These quantities, in fat, are not equal lµ

b (1), i.e., its representations Lµ

′

ν (4) whih onnets di(cid:27)erent oordinatizations, Se. 2. In the usual ovariant

e , represent the same
e 6= lµ
e , but they only

′

′

ν,e (2) or Lµ

′

ν,r (5), and the

25

refer to the same tensor quantity la

AB . If only one oordinatization is always used, usually the (cid:17)e(cid:17)

oordinatization, then the onventional ovariant approah an be applied. However the physis

must not depend on the hosen oordinatization, whih means that the theory has to be formulated

in the manner that does not depend on the hoie of some spei(cid:28) oordinatization. The Einstein

oordinatization is nothing more physial but the (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatization or any other permissible

oordinatization. This requirement is ful(cid:28)lled in the (cid:17)TT relativity.(cid:17) The same thing an be also

seen from di(cid:27)erent relations in this paper, e.g., Eq. (25) for the the eletromagneti (cid:28)eld tensor

Se. 5.2. The analysis leading to Eqs. (34) and (35) and these equations themselves learly

show why the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) is an invariant (in ontrast to the usual ovariant) formulation of

F ab

SR, Se. 5.3.

The same examples as in the (cid:17)TT relativity,(cid:17) Ses. 3.1 and 3.2, are onsidered in the usual

(cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) in Ses. 4.1 and 4.2. In ontrast to the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) the traditionally used (cid:17)AT

relativity,(cid:17) onsiders di(cid:27)erent spatial lengths l1

(13) for the Lorentz (cid:17)ontration(cid:17) in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) and (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatizations respetively. Similarly the

temporal distanes L0

e and L0

r are onneted with l0

e, l0

r, i.e., with the muon lifetime at rest, by the

relations (15) and (16) for the time (cid:17)dilatation(cid:17) in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) and (cid:17)r(cid:17) oordinatizations respetively.

The fat that the Lorentz (cid:17)ontration(cid:17) and the time (cid:17)dilatation(cid:17) onnet di(cid:27)erent quantities in

4D spaetime proves that both transformations are the AT.

In Se. 5.1 we have presented the onventional derivation of the transformations for the 3-

vetors E and B, (22) and (24) by means of the identi(cid:28)ations of the omponents of E and B with
some of the basis omponents of F ab, the equations (17) and (21). But as shown in Se. 5.2 when

only some of the basis omponents of a tensor quantity are taken separately, as in the identi(cid:28)ations

(17) and (21), then they do not orrespond to any de(cid:28)nite physial quantity in 4D spaetime. This

an be interpreted saying that the transformations (22) and (24) onnet di(cid:27)erent quantities in

4D spaetime and thus that they are the AT. The same result is obtained in Se. 5.3 onsidering

the derivation from

of (24) and (22) whih expliitly uses the Lorentz (cid:17)ontration(cid:17) (12). In

(18)

Se. 5.3 we have shown that the Maxwell equations in the 3-vetor form (18), or equivalently (30)

(always only in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization), are not ovariant (they hange their form when going

from an IFR S to another relatively moving IFR S′, see (36)), and that they are not equivalent to

the tensor Maxwell equations (28), or to the CBGEs (29), (33), (31). Further we have examined

the onventional, i.e., the (cid:17)AT relativity(cid:17) de(cid:28)nitions of harge by means of the volume integral of

the harge density and in terms of the Gauss law (for the 3-vetor E) when written in the integral

form Eq. (3) Se. 5 in Ref. 18. Also Purell's formal statement of the relativisti invariane of

harge is disussed. It is shown that in the (cid:17)TT relativity(cid:17) these onventional de(cid:28)nitions has to be

replaed by the tensor equations (37) and (38).

In Se. 6 we have introdued the 4-vetors Ea

and Ba

we have formulated the Maxwell equations as tensor equations with Ea
(41) and the equations for the basis omponents Eα
These equations are ompletely equivalent to the usual ovariant Maxwell equations in the F ab

and Bα

(42) (all in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization).

instead of the usual 3-vetors E and B and
and Ba, i.e., as the CBGEs

formulation, (29) and (19). In Se. 6.1 we have presented the expressions for the Lorentz fore

in terms of the 4-vetors Ea
and Ba. It has been expliitly shown in Se. 6.2 that all the results
obtained in a given IFR S from the usual Maxwell equations with E and B remain valid in the
formulation with the 4-vetors Ea
who measure the (cid:28)elds Ea
and Ba
onstruted the Ma jorana eletromagneti (cid:28)eld four-vetor Ψa
(47) by means of four-vetors Ea
and Ba. The Maxwell equations in the ovariant Ma jorana formulation have been written in the

and Ba

and are at rest in the onsidered IFR. Then in Se. 6.3 we have

(in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization), but only for the observers

oordinate-based geometri language and in the (cid:17)e(cid:17) oordinatization as (48) and in the omponent

form as (50). Using Ma jorana formulation we have found a Dira like relativisti wave equation for

the free photon (51). Our next step will be the appliation of this ovariant Ma jorana formulation

to the quantum eletrodynamis.

Motion of a charged particle with ﬁnite size, described by Sommerfeld
model, in static magnetic ﬁeld has two peculiar features: 1.) there is the
eﬀect of tunneling - Sommerfeld particle overcomes the barrier and ﬁnds
itself in the forbidden, from classical point of view, area; 2.) the untwisting
of trajectory in cyclotron for Sommerfeld particle is strongly delayed compared
to that of a classical particle.

Here we continue our investigation of peculiar features of motion of Som-
merfeld particle [1]. Let us remind that long time ago [2] Sommerfeld pro-
posed a model of a charged particle of ﬁnite size - sphere with uniform sur-
face charge Q and mechanical mass m. In nonrelativistic approximation such
sphere obeys the equation (see also [3]):

m ˙~v = ~Fext + η [~v(t − 2a/c) − ~v(t)]

(1)

here a - radius of the sphere, η = Q2
center of the shell, ~Fext - some external force.

~R - coordinate of the

This model is a good tool to consider eﬀects of radiation reaction of a
charged particle of ﬁnite size, free of problems of classical point-like Lorentz-
Dirac description.

A.

If Sommerfeld particle moves in the external static magnetic ﬁeld ~H, the

force ~Fext = R d~rρ · [

˙~R, ~H] for ρ = Qδ(|~r − ~R| − a)/4πa2 has the form

If magnetic ﬁeld has non-zero values only in the shell of ﬁnite size S (
0 < Y < S, ~H is parallel to z-axis, ~R = (X, Y, 0) ), then, as the particle has
ﬁnite size 2a, force ~Fext must be multiplied by the factor f :

We see that for initial velocities v smaller, then the critical velocity vcr =
λL, particle trajectory (half-circle) lies inside the shell, i.e. particle cannot
overcome the barrier. If L = 104, λ = 10−4 then vcr = 1.

We numerically investigated the particle motion governed by equation (3)

for the following values of initial velocity:

v = 0.43,

v = 0.44

and for

L = 104, λ = 10−4, d = 1.0, K = 4/(3d2),

i.e. particle is of electron size and mass, magnetic ﬁeld approximately equals
1012 gauss and S ≈ 5, 6 · 10−9sm.

The result is shown on Fig. A, compared with classical trajectory, gov-

erned by (7) with v = 0.44. Horisontal axis is x and vertical axis is y.

The eﬀect of tunneling for Sommerfeld particle is vividly seen: velocity
v = 0.44 is smaller then the critical vcr = 1, but the particle overcomes
the barrier and ﬁnds itself in the forbidden from classical point of view area
y > L = 104.

B.

If magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to z-axis for y < 0 and y > L and equals to
zero for 0 < y < L, and for 0 < y < L there is static electric ﬁeld E, parallel
to y- axis in such a way, that it is always collinear to y-component of particle
velocity (i.e. particle is always accelerates in the clearance 0 < y < L), then
there is a model of cyclotron.

Equation of motion for Sommerfeld particle in cyclotron reads

¨y = K · [ ˙y(τ − d) − ˙y(τ )] − λ · ˙x · f + ǫ · Sgn( ˙y) · (1 − f ),

¨x = K · [ ˙x(τ − d) − ˙x(τ )] + λ · ˙y · f,

(8)

ǫ =

Classical analog of (8) one can construct replacing in (8) K by zero and f
by g (6):

¨y = −λ · ˙x · g + ǫ · Sgn( ˙y) · (1 − g),

¨x = λ · ˙y · g,

(9)

Initial conditions are:

x(0) = y(0) = ˙x(0) = ˙y(0) = 0

Due to classical equation of motion without radiation reaction (9) particle
moves along untwisting trajectory. Total increase of kinetic energy Wc =
( ˙x)2/2 + ( ˙y)2/2 of particle is N · e · L:

Wc = N · ǫ · L

where N - is the total number of passing of particle through the accelerating
ﬁeld E.

If N = 10,

ǫ = λ = 10−7, L = 105, then

Wc = 10−1.

We numerically calculated the particle motion governed by equation (8) with
zero initial conditions for the following values of parameters:

L = 105, λ = 10−7 = ǫ, d = 0.3, K = 2.0,

i.e. particle is of electron size and mass, magnetic ﬁeld approximately equals
to 8.1 · 107 gauss and electric ﬁeld produces in the clearance potential diﬀer-
ence equal to 104 eV.

The results of calculations are shown on Fig. B.1 - classical case and on
Fig. B.2 - case of Sommerfeld particle. Horisontal axis is x · λ and vertical
axis is y · λ.

We see that for the same ”time” τ ≈ 108 (i.e t ≈ 10−4sec) classical particle
(without radiation reaction) made N = 10 passings through the accelerating
ﬁeld E with total energy increase Wc = 10−1, while Sommerfeld particle
made only N = 6 passings with total energy increase Ws = 0.0375 ( Wc

4

for N = 6 is equal to 0.06 ). Thus untwisting of trajectory for Sommerfeld
particle is strongly delayed compared to that of a classical one.

Delay in energy increase falls mainly on the moments of passing through
the clearance. It can be explained by diﬀerence in accelerations in electric
ﬁeld (proportional to ǫ ≈ 10−7) and in magnetic ﬁeld (proportional to v · λ ≈
10−8 ) as ﬂux of radiating energy is proportional to square of acceleration.

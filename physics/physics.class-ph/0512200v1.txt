Abstract

We discuss the seminal article in which Le Bellac and L´evy-Leblond have
identiﬁed two Galilean limits of electromagnetism [1], and its modern implica-
tions. We use their results to point out some confusion in the literature and
in the teaching of special relativity and electromagnetism. For instance, it is
not widely recognized that there exist two well deﬁned non-relativistic limits,
so that researchers and teachers are likely to utilize an incoherent mixture of
both. Recent works have shed a new light on the choice of gauge conditions
in classical electromagnetism. We retrieve Le Bellac-L´evy-Leblond’s results by
examining orders of magnitudes, and then with a Lorentz-like manifestly co-
variant approach to Galilean covariance based on a 5-dimensional Minkowski
manifold. We emphasize the Riemann-Lorenz approach based on the vector and
scalar potentials as opposed to the Heaviside-Hertz formulation in terms of elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds. We discuss various applications and experiments, such as
in magnetohydrodynamics and electrohydrodynamics, quantum mechanics, su-
perconductivity, continuous media, etc. Much of the current technology where
waves are not taken into account, is actually based on Galilean electromag-
netism.

Key words: Galilean covariance, special relativity, electromagnetism, four-potential.

1 Introduction

The purpose of this article is to emphasize the relevance of Galilean covariance in
physics, even nowadays, about one hundred years after Lorentz, Poincar´e and Ein-
stein, then facing the apparent incompatibility between Galilean mechanics and the
full set of Maxwell equations, have developed a theory that turned into special rel-
ativity [2]. Seventy years later, Le Bellac and L´evy-Leblond (LBLL) observed that
there exist not only one, but two well-deﬁned Galilean (that is, non-relativistic) limits
of electromagnetism: the so-called ‘magnetic’ and ‘electric’ limits [1]. Although spe-
cial relativity has superseded Galilean relativity when it comes to the description of
high energy phenomena, there exists a wealth of low-energy systems, particularly in
condensed matter physics and low-energy nuclear physics, where Galilean covariance
should not be ignored.

We wish to point out hereafter some confusion which results from not recognizing
appropriately the two Galilean limits of electromagnetism. This follows from inacu-
rate deﬁnitions of non-relativistic covariance, which is why we emphasize at once that
the deﬁnition of Galilean covariance employed henceforth in this paper rests on its
compatibility with the Galilean transformations of space-time (Eq. (6), below). Ex-
amples of misleading, though well known, such text presentations are mentioned in
[1], and there were many more since then. The fact that one should be careful when
dealing with electrodynamics at low velocities has been illustrated, for instance, in
Ref. [3]. Let us illustrate this point with a simple example. Under a Lorentz transfor-
mation with relative velocity v, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, in vacuum, become

respectively. The fact that Galilean covariance is a much more subtle concept than
simply taking the v << c, or γ
1, limit is illustrated by the fact that Eq. (1) then
becomes:

which not only is not compatible with Galilean relativity but, worse, does not even
satisfy the composition properties of transformation groups [1, 3]. That is to say, a
sequence of such transformations does not have the same form as above.

×

We have organized this article as follows. In Section 2, we recall the main results
of LBLL [1] for later reference. In Section 3, we obtain these results using two ar-
guments: one based on orders of magnitudes and a recent covariant approach with
which the Galilean space-time is embedded into a ﬁve-dimensional space. Throughout
the paper, we favour the Riemann-Lorenz formulation of electrodynamics, based on
the scalar and vector potentials, over the Heaviside-Hertz approach which involved
electromagnetic ﬁelds [4]. Discussion and applications are in Section 4. Therein
we present magnetohydrodynamics and electrohydrodynamics as two not-so-distant

cousins which can be associated respectively with the ‘magnetic’ and ‘electric’ Galilean
limits of electrodynamics. We show that engineers are used to employ these Galilean
limits which they denote as the electro- and magnetoquasistatics. We revisited Feyn-
man’s proof of the magnetic limit and illustrate the latter within the realm of super-
conductivity. Finally, we reassess our current understanding of the electrodynamics
of moving bodies by examining the Trouton-Noble experiment in a Galilean context...

2 Galilean electromagnetism

The purpose of LBLL was to write down the laws of electromagnetism in a form
compatible with Galilean covariance rather than Lorentz covariance. As LBLL put
it, such laws could have been devised by a physicist in the mid-nineteenth century
[1]. Here, let us retrieve these laws from relativistic kinematics. The Lorentz trans-
formation of a four-vector (u0, u), where the four components have the same units, is
given by (see chapter 7 of Ref. [5]):

u′0 = γ
u′ = u

√1−v2/c2 , with a relative velocity v. The speed of light in the vacuum
is denoted c. LBLL were the ﬁrst to observe that this transformation admits two
well-deﬁned Galilean limits [1]. One limit is for timelike vectors:

where γ

which, as we shall see, may be related to the so-called electric limit. The second limit
is for spacelike vectors:

and will be associated to the magnetic limit. As it is well known, the space-time
coordinates can be described by timelike vectors only. Indeed, Eq. (4) has the form
of Galilean inertial space-time transformations:

(4)

(5)

(6)

Nevertheless, other vectors, such as the four-potential and four-current, may trans-
form as one or the other of the two limits.

An example of the subtlety of non-relativistic kinematical covariance is that it is
quite common to neglect to enforce the condition that a non-relativistic limit involves
not only low-velocity phenomena, but also large timelike intervals then one obtains
diﬀerent kinematics, referred to as Carroll kinematics [6]. In other terms, a Galilean

world is one within which units of time are naturally much larger than units of space.
The existence of events physically connected by large spacelike intervals would imply
loss of causality, among other things. Other such kinematics, each one being some
limit of the de Sitter kinematics, have been classiﬁed in [7].

The situation is similar with electric and magnetic ﬁelds. One needs to compare
the module of the electric ﬁeld E to c times the module of the magnetic ﬁeld, i.e. cB.
When the magnetic ﬁeld is dominant, Eq. (1) reduces to a transformation referred
to as the magnetic limit of electromagnetism:
E′
B′

m = Em + v
m = Bm.

Em << cBm,

Bm,

The other alternative, where the electric ﬁeld is dominant, leads to the electric limit:

E′
e = Ee,
B′
e = Be −

c2 v

Ee >> cBe,
Ee.

×
Indeed, the approximations Ee/c >> Be and v << c together imply that Ee/v >>
Ee/c >> Be so that we take Ee >> vBe in Eq. (1). Such an analysis of orders of
magnitude is described in the next section.

From the Galilean transformations of space-time, Eq. (6), we ﬁnd

′ =

∂t′ = ∂t + v

The ﬁelds transformations in the magnetic limit of Eq. (7) are clearly compatible with
the use of Eq. (9) together with the transformations of the four-potential (V, A):

V ′
m = Vm −

m = Am,

(note the similarity with Eq. (5)) where

Similarly, the electric limit of Eq. (8) may be obtained from Eq. (9) and the trans-
formations of the four-potential:

e = Ve,
A′
e = Ae −
(4). Now, however, the ﬁelds are related to the

This equation is similar to Eq.

In parallel with the two possible sets of transformations of the four-potential, there
are two ways to transform the four-current (ρ, j). In the magnetic limit, it transforms
like Eq. (5):

The appearance of an ‘eﬀective’ charge density ρ′

jm is certainly one
of the salient feature of the magnetic limit. We will refer the interested reader to the
following works which discussed the eﬀect of this eﬀective charge without pointing
out its Galilean origin for most of them [8].

laws themselves, this fact is not so obvious if one naively takes the limit c
. In
the next section, we present an argument based on dimensional analysis and orders of
magnitude. In Ref. [1], it was found that, in the electric limit, the Maxwell equations
reduce to:

Ee = 0,
Be = 0,

Clearly, the main diﬀerence with the relativistic Maxwell equations is that here the

3 Recent analyses

3.1 Orders of magnitude

Many errors occur within low-velocity limits of relativistic theories when one naively
replaces some quantities with zero, rather than carefully comparing various orders of
magnitudes involved in the equations. As we shall show herafter, we do not require
fanciful mathematical tools to retrieve the two Galilean limits of electromagnetism
of LBLL. As discussed by one of us in Ref. [9], a careful dimensional analysis of the
ﬁelds equations is suﬃcient for this purpose. Therein, it is argued that the electric and
magnetic limits may be retrieved by a careful consideration of the order of magnitude
of the dimensionless parameters:

L
cT

,

ε

≡

and

j
cρ

,

ξ

≡

(21)

where L, T , j and ρ represent the orders of magnitude of length, time, current den-
sity, and charge density, respectively. The Galilean kinematics considered hereafter
corresponds to the quasistatic limit ε << 1. The other extreme, ε >> 1, leads to
the so-called Carroll kinematics [6]. The main undesirable feature of this kinematical
structure is the loss of causality.

The electric or magnetic character of the Galilean limits of electromagnetism is
determined by the behavior of the parameter ξ. From Gauss’s law and Amp`ere’s law,
Eq. (18), we ﬁnd cB

E ≃

Using this result and Eqs. (7), (8), we ﬁnd:

electric limit.

Returning to Eq. (21), we see that the magnetic limit correspond to the approxima-
tion j >> cρ, that is, the spacelike component is larger than the timelike component.
This echoes the transformation in Eq. (5). Conversely, the electric limit correspond
to the approximation cρ >> j, so that the spacelike component now is much larger
than the timelike component. This is analogue to Eq. (4).

From Maxwell displacement current term in the Amp`ere’s law, Eq. (18), we ﬁnd

where v denotes the ratio of orders of magnitude L/T . Similarly, the magnetic in-
duction term of Faraday’s law gives

If we substitute this result into Eq. (23), we ﬁnd that the displacement current term
and the full Faraday’s law are compatible only if v
c, that is, in the Lorentz covariant
regime. However, Eq. (23) cannot be obtained if we drop ∂tE from Amp`ere’s law,
so that it is compatible with the ﬁrst and third lines of Eq. (19), i.e. in the electric
limit. On the other hand, Eq. (24) is compatible with lines one and three of Eq. (20),
i.e. the magnetic limit, because it does not appear if we drop the magnetic induction
term ∂tB of Faraday’s law in line three of Eq. (18).

Following the lines of Ref.

[10]-[14], we use the Riemann-Lorenz formulation of
electromagnetism, which relies on the potentials as the basic quantities, in order
to retrieve the two Galilean limits. This is in opposition to the Heaviside-Hertz
formulation, which is based on the magnetic and electric ﬁelds [10]-[12]. In terms of
potentials, the equations of classical electromagnetism read

Once again, this echoes our comment following Eq. (22): in the magnetic limit, the
spacelike quantity cA is dominant, whereas in the electric limit, it is the timelike
quantity V which dominates.

If we compare the two terms of the Lorenz (not Lorentz [13]) gauge condition, Eq.

(26), we ﬁnd

In the quasistatic regime, ε << 1, we ﬁnd therefore two possibilities. If ξ << 1, like
ε, then we are in the electric limit, and the gauge condition is similar to the Lorenz

Let us use the orders of magnitude for the four-potential components and obtain
thereof their Galilean transformations in the magnetic limit, Eq. (10), and the electric
limit, Eq. (12). From Eq. (3) with u0 = V /c and u = A, we ﬁnd that the scalar
potential V and the vector potential A transform, under a Lorentz transformation,

Therefore, in the quasistatic limit ε << 1, this equation gives ξ >> 1, so that the
ﬁrst line is compatible with the magnetic limit. Accordingly, this is incompatible with
the electric limit, for which ξ << 1, so that the term v

ﬁrst line of Eq. (37) in the electric limit.

3.2 Reduction from (4, 1) Minkowski space-time

Hereafter we review brieﬂy a diﬀerent approach to the Galilean gauge ﬁelds [16].
It involves a formulation of Galilean invariance based on a reduction from a ﬁve-
dimensional Minkowski manifold to the Newtonian space-time [17]-[19]. The extended
space is such that a Galilean boost with relative velocity v = (v1, v2, v3) acts on a
Galilei-vector (x, t, s) as

x′ = x
t′ = t,
s′ = s

·
Since ∂s tranforms like the mass m (see below for a justiﬁcation), one can see the
additional coordinate s as being conjugate to the mass m since both are invariant
under Galilean transformations. s may be seen also as the action per unit mass. More
about classical and quantum physical interpretations of s is in Refs. [16]-[19].

3.2.1 Electric limit

As mentioned previously, the electric limit is characterized by four-potential and four-
current vectors which are timelike, that is, their time component is much larger than
the length of their spatial components. In the reduction approach, it corresponds to
deﬁning the embedding of the potentials and currents as

respectively.

From Eqs. (42) and (53) we retrieve Eq. (12). Similarly we obtain Eq. (16) from
Eqs. (45) and (54). As for the continuity equation, Eq. (46), it becomes Eq. (17).
From the ﬁrst line of Eq. (44), we come to the natural deﬁnition:

4.1 Gauge conditions and Galilean electromagnetism

∂tA

In this section, we describe the two Galilean limits using the Riemann-Lorentz ap-
proach, that is, in terms of the scalar and vector potentials. The deﬁnition E =
V of Eq. (11) takes diﬀerent forms in the Galilean limit, depending on
−
the order of magnitude of each term. This is because the Galilean transformations
for the potentials depend on whether we take the electric or magnetic limit. Let us
evaluate the order of magnitude of the ratio between its two terms:

Ve, as stated in Eq. (13). The curl of this expression

Let us illustrate how the choice of the gauge condition allows one to retrieve the
two sets of “Galilean Maxwell equations” in terms of the ﬁelds, as stated by LBLL
[1]. In the magnetic limit, the condition ξ >> 1 leads to Eq. (36), as mentioned
earlier. From the deﬁnition of Bm and using the identity

where we have utilized again Eq. (36). This is the second inhomogeneous equation,

In the electric limit, ξ << 1 and Eq. (34) lead to the Lorenz condition, Eq. (35).
Proceeding as in the magnetic limit, we ﬁrst calculate the curl of Be, which gives us

where we have used Eqs. (13) and (32).

Therefore, let us point out forcefully that the choice of a gauge condition is dictated
by the relativistic versus Galilean nature of the problem. The Lorenz gauge condition
must be chosen in the relativistic context as well as in the electric Galilean limit. The
Coulomb gauge condition can be chosen only in the magnetic limit. For example, this
implies that quantization in the Coulomb gauge of light waves is prohibited because
of Galilean covariance and must be re-examined. We refer to a discussion of the
physical meaning that one can ascribe to the various gauge conditions [14].

From the historical point of view, Galilean electromagnetism has shed a new light
on the pre-relativity era. Indeed, a careful reading of James Clerk Maxwell’s famous
Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism reveals that he has employed the electric limit
when dealing with dielectrics in his ﬁrst volume [20]. On the other hand, in his sec-
ond volume, he used the magnetic limit when dealing with ohmic conductors, except

13

toward the end, where he introduced into the magnetic limit equations the so-called
displacement current ‘by hand’ in order to demonstrate that light is a transverse
electromagnetic wave [20]. But, as we have seen in the particular case of the electric
limit (and it is also valid in relativity), the displacement current follows from choos-
ing the Lorenz gauge whereas Maxwell (wrongfully!) kept the Coulomb gauge within
the relativistic context for the ﬁelds. This diﬃculty enticed Hertz and Heaviside to
abandon potentials and to cast Maxwell’s equations in terms of ﬁelds rather than po-
tentials. Albert Einstein read Hertz’ papers on the topic and subsequently employed
Maxwell equations in terms of the ﬁelds (the Heaviside-Hertz formulation) whereas
Henri Poincar´e employed Maxwell equations in terms of the potentials (the Riemann-
Lorenz formulation) by adopting the Lorenz condition in a relativistic context [2].

4.2 Magnetoquasistatics (MHD) and electroquasitatics (EHD)

Experts working on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and experts of electrohydrody-
namics (EHD) might be surprised to realize that they actually work with diﬀerent
sets of approximations of the Maxwell equations where retardation (and, therefore,
waves) has been neglected. Indeed, the displacement current is negligible in MHD
(as in Eq. (20)), whereas in EHD the electric ﬁeld has a vanishing curl (Eq. (19).
Hence, eﬀects that are important in MHD becomes marginal in EHD, and vice versa.
Melcher has greatly clariﬁed these facts by disjoining the electroquasistationary
approximation used in EHD and the magnetoquasistationary approximation used in
MHD [21] Section 3.2 of Melcher and Haus [21] shows that the underlying equations
are precisely the same as the Galilean limits, Eqs. (19) and (20). His main argument
relies on the comparison between three characteristics time scales (σ is the electric
conductivity): (1) the magnetic diﬀusion time τm = µ0σL2, (2) the charge relaxation
time τe = ǫ0/σ and (3) the wave transit time τem = L/c = √τe ×
τm, which is the
square root of the product of the two former time scales. By deﬁnition, the transit
time is always between the magnetic and electric times. For example, in the magnetic
limit, the charge relaxation time scale is very small and the magnetic ﬁeld does have
enough time to diﬀuse inside the Ohmic carrier. It is straightforward to see that the
electroquasistatic of Melcher corresponds to the electric limit whereas the magnetic
limit is just the magnetoquasistatic. Hence, a large amount of our technology is based
on Galilean electromagnetism as soon as waves are neglected.

4.3 The Faraday tensor and its dual

It is well known that in special relativity, the Faraday tensor, deﬁned in Eq. (43):
∂µAν −
(in this section, µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3) and its dual:

Fµν ≡

∂νAµ,

∗Fµν =

ǫµνρσFρσ,

1
2

14

do have the same physical meaning. This is not the case within Galilean electro-
magnetism. Indeed, as pointed out by Earman and subsequently discussed by Ry-
nasiewicz, the Galilean tranformations of the Faraday tensor and its dual lead to the
electric or the magnetic limit, respectively [22]. The eﬀect of this duality operation
amounts to exchanging E and B as follows:

E

cB and B

E/c.

→

→ −

One recovers very easily the magnetic and electric limits, Eqs. (7) and (8), by applying
the duality transformations directly to the electric transformations of the ﬁeld in order
to get the magnetic transformations, and vice versa.

It is also noted in Ref. [22] that the ﬁeld transformations of the magnetic limit are

obtained when E and B are expressed in terms of ‘covariant’, or

, tensor Fµν,

whereas the electric limit is obtained when the ﬁelds transformations are calculated

by using the ‘contravariant’, or

, tensor F µν. Let us illustrate it brieﬂy, with

4.4 Quantum mechanics

In 1990, Dyson published a demonstration of Maxwell equations due to Richard Feyn-
man [23]. This demonstration, which relied on Lagrangians and quantum mechanics,
dated back to the forties and had remained hitherto unpublished. However, the proof
was believed to be incomplete because Feynman had discussed only the homogeneous
Maxwell equations, given by the ﬁrst two lines in Eq. (18):

E =

∂tB,

∇×

−

B = 0.

∇ ·

In 1999, Brown and Holland revisited this demonstration and they have noted the
Schr¨odinger equation admitted external potentials only if they were compatible with
the magnetic limit of LBLL and, therefore, with the Coulomb gauge condition [24]. It
is clear from Eq. (20) that the homogeneous Maxwell equations given above are valid
only within the magnetic limit, because the electric ﬁeld has zero curl in the electric
limit, Eq. (19). This is a consequence of the Galilean magnetic limit of the four-
potential which does enters into Schr¨odinger equation. Let us recall the statement
of Brown and Holland more precisely. The Schr¨odinger equation with external ﬁelds
V (x, t) and A(x, t):

where φ(x, t) is some scalar function. Note that the factor in front of Ψ(x, t) trans-
forms like the parameter s in Eq. (39). If we choose φ(x, t) = 0, then the equations
above reduce to Eq. (10), which represents the Galilean transformations of the po-
tentials in the magnetic limit.

This point agrees with later results by Vaidya and Farina [25]. In a subsequent
study, Holland and Brown have shown that Maxwell equations admit an electric
limit only if the source is a Dirac current [26]. In addition, they have proved that the
Dirac equation admits both Galilean limits, just like Maxwell equations, corroborating
thereby earlier results by L´evy-Leblond [27]. What Feynmann did not (actually, could
not) realize is that he had derived only the part of Maxwell equations compatible
with both Galilean relativity and quantum mechanics, that is, the magnetic limit
and, hence, the homogeneous equations.

4.5 Superconductivity

Superconductivity also enters into the realm of the magnetic limit, because it selects
the Coulomb gauge condition as a necessary consequence of Galilean covariance. In-
deed, the well-known London equation states that the current density is proportional
to the vector potential (the star denotes Cooper pairs): p = m∗v + q∗A = 0. As a
matter of fact, there is a perfect transfert of electromagnetic momentum to kinetic
momentum. Hence, contrary to what is usually stated, gauge invariance is not bro-
ken by superconductivity since the Coulomb gauge condition is implied. Moreover,
the Meissner eﬀect can be explained by starting with Amp`ere’s equation written as
B = µ0j, that is, without displacement current term as in the magnetic case,
∇ ×
2A
µ0j in the
third line of Eq. (20). Hence, this expression (or more directly
∇
A = 0 and London equation, leads
Riemann-Lorenz formulation) together with
∇ ·
to solutions (in one dimension x) of the type A
const x so that the vector
potential (hence the magnetic ﬁeld) only penetrates the superconductor to a depth
1/const.

≃ −

exp

−

≃

Superconductivity cannot be associated to a symmetry breaking of gauge invari-
ance but is magnetic Galilean covariant. This unusual statement has been recently
advocated by Martin Greiter by a diﬀerent approach [28]. As a matter of fact, it is
the global U(1) phase rotation symmetry that is spontaneously violated. A striking
consequence is that the Higgs mechanism for providing mass to particles becomes
doubtful, since it was believed to be analogous to the assumed symmetry breaking of
gauge invariance in superconductivity.

4.6 Electrodynamics of continuous media at low velocities

One often ﬁnds in textbooks that a dielectric in motion is characterized by the pres-
ence of a motional polarization given by the following formula [29]:

P′ = ǫ0χ(E + v

B).

×

(57)

where χ is the dielectric susceptibility. For example, H.A. Lorentz utilized it in order
to derive the Fresnel-Fizeau formula at ﬁrst order (see p. 174-176 of Ref.
[29] and
Ref. [30]). We will see that this formula can be misleading.

Moreover, in 1904, Lorentz claimed that a moving magnet could become electri-
cally polarized [31]. In 1908, Einstein and Laub noted that Minkowski transforma-
tions for the ﬁelds and the excitations [32] predict that a moving magnetic dipole
develops an electric dipole moment [33]. It would be interesting to reexamine these
predictions in the light of Galilean electromagnetism within continuous media. In-
deed, if one starts from the Minkowski transformations relating the polarization and
the magnetization [32], one would expect two Galilean limits: one with M′ = M and
P and P′ = P (see Chapter 9
P′ = P
×
of Ref. [29]).

M/c2 and the other with M′ = M + v

−

×

v

We can derive from the Riemann-Lorenz formulation Maxwell’s equations within
continuous media following O’Rahilly [12]. More directly, one can infer the form
of Maxwell equations in continuous media by mimicking the vacuum case by either
supressing the displacement current or the Faraday term.

Maxwell equations in continuous media are covariant under the Poincar´e-Lorentz

transformations [32]:

In continuous media, the constitutive laws relate the excitation D, the ﬁeld E and
the polarization M:

These relations are valid in both Galilean and Einsteinian relativity [32]. Let us now
turn to the electromagnetic laws when we take into account the motion of a medium
at low velocity [21].

First, we recall the Galilean transformations for the diﬀerentiation operators:

K is the surface current, σ the surface charge, Σ the surface separating both

The formula, Eq. (57), used by Lorentz is not compatible with Galilean relativity.
However, the electric ﬁeld and the magnetic ﬁeld which create the polarization in
Fizeau experiment come from a light wave so that Lorentz was right to use this
formula after all, even though there is no contradiction with the electric limit formula
P′ = P = ǫ0χE′ = ǫ0χE.

4.7 Electrodynamics of moving bodies at low velocities

Galilean electromagnetism raises severe doubts concerning our current understanding
of the electrodynamics of moving media. Indeed, several experiments, like the ones
by Roentgen [34], Eichenwald [35], Wilson [36], Wilson and Wilson [37], Trouton and
Noble [38], etc., were believed to corroborate special relativity. As we will demonstrate
for the Trouton-Noble experiment, there is not always a need for special relativity
because the typical relative velocity in these experiments is well below the speed of
light. Then, the question is whether the above mentioned experiments be explained
by either the electric limit, the magnetic limit or a combination of both.

4.7.1 The Trouton-Noble experiment

The Trouton-Noble’s experiment is thought to be the electromagnetic analogue of
the optical Michelson and Morley experiment [38]. It was designed in order to show
whether one can observe a mechanical velocity of the ether if one considers that the
luminiferous medium should be a medium whose parts can be followed mechanically.
Like the null result of Michelson-Morley’s optical experiment, the Trouton-Noble
experiment was negative in the sense that one was not able to detect either an absolute
motion with respect to the ether, or a partial entrainment, as believed by other various
theories.

20

In 1905, Albert Einstein suggested to consider the ether as superﬂuous since the ex-
periments were not able to detect a mechanical motion of it. Others, like H. Poincar´e
and H.A. Lorentz, were reluctant to abandon the notion of ether as the bearer of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, despite the fact that they have adopted the relativity princi-
ple. However, in 1920, Einstein recoursed to the ether as the bearer of the metric
allowing the propagation of gravitational waves, at a conference in Leyden. Today,
even though the ether is a banished word in modern science, one can use it as did the
older Einstein in order to describe the vacuum with physical (though not mechanical)
properties.

Before the advent of special relativity, Hertz, Wien, Abraham, Lorentz, Cohn and
others have used the transformations given in Eq. (2), which is an incoherent mixture
of the electric and magnetic Galilean limits [39]. As mentioned previously, these
expressions do not even obey the group property of composition of transformations.
Trouton and Noble expected a positive eﬀect when a charged capacitor is in motion
with an angle θ between the plates and the velocity [38]. Indeed, the electric ﬁeld
in the frame of the capacitor generates a magnetic ﬁeld in the ether frame (v is the
absolute velocity):

If one denotes as V = E/l the diﬀerence of potential between the plates, then the

which is maximal for θ = 45◦ and zero for θ = 90◦. Hence, the plates must be

In order to understand what is wrong with the above demonstration, we ﬁrst re-
call that the electric limit transforms as in Eq. (8). A straightforward application of
these transformations is to note that the Biot-Savart law follows from the Coulomb
law associated to the electric transformation of the magnetic ﬁeld. Contrary to the

21

transformations used by Lorentz and Trouton-Noble, they do respect the group addi-
tivity. Besides, these transformations are only compatible with the approximate set
of Maxwell equations where the time derivative in the Faraday equation vanishes, as
in Eq. (19). Hence, we can derive easily the approximate Poynting’s theorem within
the electric limit from this set:

As we can see, the energy density is of electrical origin only. Hence, no electric
energy associated with the motional magnetic ﬁeld can be taken into account within
the electric limit since it is of order v2/c2 with respect to the static, or quasistatic,
electric one. Thus, the Trouton-Noble experiment does not show any eﬀect as soon
as we are in the realm of the electric limit. We recall that the electric limit is such
that the relative velocity is small compared to the velocity of light c, and the order of
magnitude of the electric ﬁeld is large compared to the product of c by the magnetic
ﬁeld. Of course, for larger velocities, special relativity is needed and we must take
into account additional mechanical torque due to lenght contraction as usual now in
order to have a negative result (no torque).

The conclusion of Trouton and Noble is rather illuminating concerning the fact
that they did consider the energy of the motional magnetic ﬁeld to be the source of
the negative result [38]:

“There is no doubt that the result is a purely negative one. As the energy of the
magnetic ﬁeld, if it exists (and from our present point of view we must suppose it
does), must come from somewhere, we are driven to the conclusion that the elec-
trostatic energy of a capacitor must dimininish by the amount 1/2ǫ0E2v2/c2 , when
moving with a velocity v at right angles to its electrostatic lines of force where 1/2ǫ0E2
is the electrostatic energy.”

Conversely, a solenoid/magnet in motion will not create a motionnal magnetic
torque because the magnetic energy associated with the motional electric ﬁeld is
negligible compared to the magnetic energy of the static, or quasistatic, magnetic
ﬁeld.

4.7.2 “Einstein asymmetry”

In his famous article on the electrodynamics of moving media, Albert Einstein pointed
out the importance of whether or not one should ascribe energy to the ﬁelds when
dealing with motion [40]. We reproduced here the introduction of his paper:

“It is known that Maxwell’s electrodynamics -as usually understood at the present
time- when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be
inherent in the phenomena. Take, for example, the reciprocal electrodynamic action

22

of a magnet and a conductor. The observable phenomenon here depends only on the
relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, whereas the customary view draws
a sharp distinction between the two cases in which either one or the other of these
bodies is in motion. For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest, there
arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet an electric ﬁeld with a certain deﬁnite en-
ergy, producing a current at the places where parts of the conductor are situated. But
if the magnet is stationary and the conductor in motion, then no electric ﬁeld arises
in the neighbourhood of the magnet. In the conductor, however, we ﬁnd an electro-
motive force to which in itself there is no corresponding energy, but which gives rise
-assuming equality of relative motion in the two cases discussed- to electric currents
of the same path and intensity as those produced by the electric forces in the former
case.”

Like our discussion of the Trouton-Noble experiment, the magnetic Poynting’s
theorem can explain why one cannot ascribe an energy to the motional electric ﬁeld
in Einstein’s thought experiment:

This is the magnetic analogue of Eq. (58).

By applying the Lorentz transformation that he had derived in the kinematical
analysis of his article to the ‘Maxwell’ equations (in fact, he used the Heaviside-Hertz
formulation, unlike Poincar´e, who used the Riemann-Lorenz formulation in his rela-
tivity article), Einstein replaced Lorentz’s explanation:

“1. If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic ﬁeld, there
acts upon it, in addition to the electric force, an electromotive force which, if we ne-
glect the terms multiplied by the second and higher powers of v/c, is equal to the vector
product of the velocity of the charge and the magnetic force, divided by the velocity of
light. (Old manner of expression.)”

by the now famous special relativity explanation (valid for all velocities):

“2. If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic ﬁeld, the
force acting upon it is equal to the electric force which is present at the locality of
the charge, and which we ascertain by transformation of the ﬁeld to a system of co-
ordinates at rest relatively to the electrical charge. (New manner of expression.)”

Then he concluded:

“The analogy holds with magnetomotive forces. We see that electromotive force
plays in the developed theory merely the part of an auxiliary concept, which owes its

23

introduction to the circumstance that electric and magnetic forces do not exist in-
dependently of the state of motion of the system of co-ordinates. Furthermore it is
clear that the asymmetry mentioned in the introduction as arising when we consider
the currents produced by the relative motion of a magnet and a conductor, now dis-
appears. Moreover, questions as to the seat of electrodynamic electromotive forces
(unipolar machines) now have no point.”

However, we point out forcefully that the Galilean magnetic transformations of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld are suﬃcient to explain the magnet and conductor thought
experiment of Albert Einstein as Lorentz covariance is not necessary [41]. It means
that the second postulate (constancy of the velocity of light) used by Einstein was
not necessary to explain the thought experiment. Only the relativity postulate and
the magnetic Galilean transformations are necessary as the usual relative velocity of a
real experiment is much more inferior to the velocity of light. Hence for low velocities
regime, we proposed the following removal of Einstein’s asymmetry:

“3. If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic ﬁeld, the
force acting upon it is equal to the electric force which is present at the locality of the
charge, and which we ascertain by a Galilean magnetic transformation of the ﬁeld to
a system of co-ordinates at rest relatively to the electrical charge. (New manner of
expression only valid for low velocities.)”

Einstein was right to replace Lorentz explanation as Lorentz thought that the
cross product of the velocity and the magnetic ﬁeld was not an electric ﬁeld that’s
why the latter called it in particular the electromotive ﬁeld. But Einstein did not see
that the same cross product was an eﬀective electric ﬁeld due to a magnetic Galilean
transformations. Wolfgang Pauli provided a resolution of the asymmetry in his text-
book on electrodynamics but he only assumed that his calculations were a ﬁrst order
approximation of the relativistic demonstration without acknowledging the existence
of a Galilean approximation as the magnetic limit [42]. Hence, Einstein’s procedure
to remove the asymmetry is completely valid despite the fact that special relativity
is not necessary to remove it but only suﬃcient. Hence, ironically, the thought ex-
periment who leaded Albert Einstein to special relativity could have been explained
by Galilean relativity only with the use of the magnetic limit...

As pointed out a long time ago by Keswani and Kilminster [43], Maxwell did re-

solve Einstein’s asymmetry within the formalism of the magnetic limit:

“In all phenomena relating to closed circuits and the current in them, it is indif-

ferent whether the axes to which we refer the system be at rest or in motion”.

Indeed,

24

“The electromotive intensity is expressed by a formula of the same type, wheter
the motions of the conductors be referred to ﬁxed axes or to axes moving in space,
the only diﬀerences between the formulae being that in the case of moving axes the
electric potential V must be changed into V ′ = V
v.A. In all cases in which a
current is produced in a conducting circuit, the electromotive force is the line-integral
C E′.ds taken round the curve. The value of V disappears from this integral, so
e =
v.A has no inﬂuence on its value.”

Concluding remarks

One century after the relativity revolution and more than thirty years after the for-
gotten work of L´evy-Leblond and Le Bellac, Galilean electromagnetism is becoming
a ﬁeld of actual research as we can explain much more simply scores of experiments
involving the electrodynamics of moving media without the sophisticated formalism
of special relativity.

Moreover, for slow velocities, it is now obvious that special relativity’s eﬀects
such as the length variation cannot explain (as it was believed so far) these experi-
ments since it is negligible. In the realm of mechanics, what would have happened
if Newton was born after Einstein? We are exactly in this situation with respect to
electromagnetism.

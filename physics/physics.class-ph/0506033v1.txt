Complex Relativity:
Gravity and Electromagnetic Fields

Abstract

We present new aspects of the electromagnetic ﬁeld by introduct-
ing the natural potentials. These natural potentials are suitable for
constructing the ﬁrst order distortions of the metric tensor of Com-
plex Relativity - the theory combining the General Relativity with the
electromagnetic equations. A transition from antisymmetric tensors
to the symmetric ones helps to deﬁne the natural potentials; their
form ﬁts a system of the Dirac matrices and this representation leads
to distortion of the metric tensor.

Our considerations have originated from the recent progresses in
the asymmetric continuum theories. One version of such theories as-
sumes an existence of the antisymmetric strain and stress ﬁelds; these
ﬁelds originate due to some kind of internal friction in a continuum
medium which have elastic bonds related to rotations of the particles.

Key words: Complex Relativity, natural potentials, uniﬁed ﬁelds.

1 Introduction

This work, related to the General Relativity and electromagnetic ﬁeld, was
inspired by some recent results in the asymmetric continuum theories in-
cluding the spin motions; therefore, we shall, ﬁrst of all, quote the numerous
attempts to extend the General Relativity to include the spin motions. The
ﬁrst one, that in the Cartan works [4] was inﬂuenced by work by Cosserat
brothers [5] in which a moment stress tensor is included in a generalized
continuum. A gradual development of the Einstein-Cartan Theory (ECT)
started by works of Sciama [18], Kibble [9] and Trautman [35, 36]; for a re-
view see: [7]. Kopczyski [13] has proved that in the ECT the cosmological
solutions become free from the singularities leading to the modiﬁed Fried-
mann equation supplemented with the conservation laws for mass and spin
[37].

In the XX century, we observed an enormous development of the con-
tinuum theories: the micropolar and micromorphic theories were developed
basing on the Cosserat brothers’ work (for a review see:
[6]); the relations
joining the theories of a continuum containing defects (dislocation and discli-
nation densities) with the Riemannian curvature and torsion were considered
by Bilby, Bullough and Smith [2], Kondo [10, 12] and followed by Hollander
[8], Ben-Abraham [1] and many other authors; (for a review see:
[25, 26]);
the thermal stresses were found to have the same form as that related to
dislocation ﬁeld [16] and on this basis the thermal eﬀects were included in
the continuum with a Riemannian curvature by Kroner [14, 15], Teisseyre
[22, 23, 24] and Stojanovic et al. [21]; for a review see: [27]).

Recently the continuum theories have been generalized to the asymmetic
form [28, 30, 32] in which an additional constitutive law [19] for the an-
tisymmetric part of stresses, replacing the stress moments, joins the spin
motion with a new constant, rotation rigidity modulus, to account for the
rotation of the point-grains and propagation of the spin elastic waves. Such
waves can exist when the elastic bonds related to the rotation motions of
particles are postulated. When , in such a continuum, the material bonds
for the displacement neglecting originated deformations, there remain only
the rotation ﬁelds of spin and twist types; the respective equations appear
to have exactly the form of electromagnetic equations. On this basis, the
degenerated continuum theory (in which there exist only the spin and twist
axial motions) has been considered in the last papers by Teisseyre [30] and
Teisseyre, Bia lecki and G´orski [31].

2

Inﬂuenced by these results, we introduce in this paper the natural poten-
tials, as deﬁned in the way suitable for constructing the ﬁrst order distortions
in the metric tensor. A transition from antisymmetric tensors to the symmet-
ric ones helped us to deﬁne these natural electromagnetic potentials; their
form ﬁts a system of the Dirac matrices and this representation leads to
distortions of the metric tensor.

The deﬁnitions helped us to propose a generalization of the General Rela-
tivity; the new theory - the Complex Relativity - includes, beside gravitation,
the electromagnetic equations in a ﬁrst order approximation.

2 Analogies to Asymmetric Continuum

We consider the physical rotation ﬁelds which can be related to the curvature
deformations of the complex space. However, we shall mention that an inspi-
ration for this idea has its source in considering the rotation and twist motion
in the asymmetric elastic continuum; of course, such motions in an elastic
continuum are bounded to some constitutive relations describing the elastic
bonds. This is main diﬀerence in comparison with motion in the space.

In our approach [34, 29, 3] a homogeneous elastic continuum with the
rotation nuclei - of spin and twist type - is supplemented, beside the classi-
cal ideal elasticity constitutive law for the symmetric strain-stress relation,
by the relation between the rotation and asymmetric stresses; such stresses
appear when including in a medium the rotation nuclei. By this supplemen-
tary constitutive law for the anti-symmetric ﬁelds, we can evade an inﬂuence
of the Hook law, which, when used as the unique law in the ideal elasticity,
rules out an existence of rotation waves. Thus, it comes out that the rotation
vibrations can propagate and are not attenuated, unlike as the elastic waves
in the ideal elastic continuum.

The twist motion diﬀers from the pure rotation; formaly, it is a motion
composed of the rotation and the mirror reﬂection. It presents the simul-
taneously occurring opposite rotation motions like shear oscillations (some
analogy, in a world of the linear displacements, presents a thermal expan-
sion/compression motion diﬀering from the simple displacements), but it can
be also related to the axial motions like those of the polarization type, or,
when assuming a posibility of material-space curvature, to a bending of the
3D space, (by analogy to the situation of a ﬂat jellyﬁsh with the bending
motions (pulsating motions) leading from 2D form to 3D one).

3

Our approach to the asymmetry of ﬁelds follows from the antisymmetric
stresses introduced by [19, 20] and related to the internal friction caused by
the grain motions under friction forces. Note that in the asymmetric contin-
uum also the related asymmetric incompatibility tensors split into symmetric
and anti-symmetric parts.

In our former papers [26, 28, 32] we have also analyzed the theory of
asymmetric continuum with defect distribution (with the dislocation and
disclination densities and the densities of rotation nuclei). Special consider-
ation was paid to rotation and twist motions related to the deﬁnition of the
twist-bend tensor.

The dislocation - stress relations and the equations of motion for sym-
metric and asymmetric parts of stresses were derived.The obtained relations
for elastic ﬁelds, given by diﬀerence of the total and self-ﬁelds, can be split
into the selfparts prevailing on the fracture plane and the total parts describ-
ing seismic radiation ﬁeld in a surrounding space. Some applications were
shortly discussed.

Finally, we shall note that a more complex deformation ﬁeld, like that
with the dislocation and disclination densities, leads, when applying the ma-
terial coordinate system, to description of a deformed state in terms of the
Riemannian geometry, or even non-Riemannian one [2, 11]. This remark
applies also to thermal deformation ﬁeld [24, 26].

3 Natural electromagnetic potentials

We have tested many variants of deﬁnition for the EM potentials, and ﬁnally
we propose the following one. We introduce the 3D vector potentials: ˜As,
ˆAs, and charge-current potentials ϕ, ψs instead of the standard 4D vector
potential Aµ. We call them the natural potentials and assume they fulﬁll the
following equations:

Bk = ǫkbs ˜As,b
Ek + ϕ,k = ǫkbs ˆAs,b

˜As,s = 0
ˆAs,s = 0

Jk =

where k, b, s ∈ {1, 2, 3}. An index after a comma denotes diﬀerentiation and
the summation convention for repeated indices is used. These new natural

potentials yield

When applying to (5)-(6) the operator ǫndk
equations:

∂

4 Natural EM Potential

— the Symmetric Tensor

To include the EM ﬁeld into the Riemannian or non-Riemannian geometry
we search for a way how to build a metric tensor which in the ﬁrst order
approximation could describe the gravity and EM ﬁelds.
Owing to the fact that for the six potentials ˜As ,

ˆAs we can introduce

the two additional conditions, we deﬁne the other set of four potentials:

˜Nn = { ˜N1 , ˜N2 , 0} and ˆNn = { ˆN1, ˆN2, 0}.

(20)

6

With these conditions we introduce the natural symmetric tensor of poten-
tials:

Ns = ˜Ns + i ˆNs

The bridge relations. We demand that ﬁrst bridge relation is satisﬁed:

ǫkbs ˜Ns,b = ǫkbs ˜As,b ,

ǫkbs ˆNs,b = ǫkbs ˆAs,b

and with the conditions

Ns = ǫsknΩn,k , Ω1 = Θ,1 , Ω2 = Θ,2

we have

N1,1 + N2,2 = 0 , N3 = 0.

The tensor Nαβ (i.e. symmetric EM potential) has changed the signs of the
terms below the diagonal of the matrix when comparing to tensor Aαβ (i.e.
antisymmetric EM potential).

To connect the antisymmetric potentials with the symmetric ones we shall

introduce also a new deﬁnition for current potential

ηα = {η1, η2, 0, 0} ,

ηs,s = 0.

We demand the validity of the second bridge relations:

ǫkbSηS,b = ǫkbnψn,b

; S = 1, 2.

Remark. A class of these EM potentials which can be transformed into the
form described above will be called two-component EM potentials. We claim
such potentials have proper form to contribute to metric tensor as described
in section 5.

However, when disturbing these matrices in the way indicated below

γ1 = (1 + N1)ǫ1 , γ2 = (1 + N2)ǫ2 , γ3 = ǫ3 , γ4 = ǫ4

(37)

we obtain the relation for the Dirac’s matrices in non-Euclidean space:

γαγβ + γβγα = 2gαβ

(38)

This relation justiﬁes our approach in which we have assumed that the nat-
ural potentials (22) can be used as the disturbances to metric tensor in any
reference system.

These complex disturbances to metric tensor can be combined with the
αβ . However let us ﬁrst discuss another possible ﬁelds

gravity disturbances hG
constructed similarly as above.

Comment: Field V. Thus, our next question is related to what would
happen when one disturbes the ǫ3 and ǫ4 matrices. To this aim, we will
consider the complex tensor potential Vαβ deﬁned as disturbances to ǫ3, ǫ4
similarly as Nαβ disturbs ǫ1, ǫ2 in (33):

The disturbances related to V3 are not symmetric hence we put V3 = 0.

With the undisturbed matrices ¯γ1 = ǫ1 , ¯γ2 = ǫ2 , ¯γ3 = ǫ3, we deﬁne the

disturbed matrics ¯γ4 :

Further on, we obtain the related metric tensor:

(35)

(36)

(39)

(40)

(41)

Vαβ = i(V3ǫ3 + V4ǫ4).

¯γ4 = i(1 + V4)ǫ4

¯gµν =

(¯γµ¯γν + ¯γν ¯γµ)

Both relations correspond to those given in (37) and (38) and, with Einstein
equations, can lead us to V αβ,β = Z α, V αβ,γ
γ = U αβ where Z α, U αβ would
represent some source ﬁelds.

Further on, we neglect the ﬁeld V αβ.

Remark. We shall note that, instead of the 4D presentation, it was also
possible to present our relations in the 2D forms with the tensor

NAB =

N2 N1
N1 −N2 (cid:21)

(cid:20)

and with the help of the Pauli 2D tensors.

5 Complex metric and curvature tensors

Our formulation of the Complex Relativity is based on the symmetric form
of perturbations introduced into the metric tensor.

The respective metric tensor can be constructed when considering the
coordinates X α (X 4 =ict) for which the numerical values, ascribed to the
points xα of the Minkovski space, do not change under deformation (for
example see [20]):

- before deformation we can write

ds2 = ηαβdxαdxβ

- while after deformation the ﬁrst order disturbances into the metric ten-

sor are:

dS2 = gαβdX αdX β , hαβ ≈ gαβ − ηαβ

For weak ﬁelds this formalism can lead us to equations for electromagnetic
and gravitation ﬁelds, when assuming that the disturbances hαβ can be re-
lated to the following ﬁelds:

(42)

(43)

• hG

• hN

αβ — the classical disturbances related to gravity

αβ = Nαβ — the disturbances related to EM ﬁeld.

We propose the metric tensor of the following form

gαβ = ηαβ + hN

αβ + hG
αβ.

(44)

10

Introducing such ﬁrst order disturbances, we can consider the complex

Riemann Rαβ and Einstein tensors

and the related basic ﬁeld equation:

Gαβ = Rαβ −

Gαβ = 0

We assume that at each point of this 6D complex space continuum there can
appear the independent spin and twist motions1 and that complex space is
combined to the point of such continuum

ǫabs ¯Xs = ǫabs ˜Xs + iǫabs ˆXs ,

¯As,s = ¯Xs,s = ˜Xs,s + i ˆXs,s = 0.

Conclusion and perspectives

In this initial work we have presented the Complex Relativity theory as
inspired by recent progress in asymmeric continuum approach to material
sciences. The goal of this work is to propose the common relativity framework
for electromagnetic and gravity ﬁelds as close as possible to the classical
General Relativity formulation. For another classical approach see [17].

We mention here possible ways of further development of our approach.
The relations for the symmetric tensors as expressed by the γ -tensors
remain valid in any reference system, but we might also return to the sys-
tem with the antisymmetric potentials ( ¯A3 diﬀerent from zero; see relations
between natural potentials in both systems) in order to get notation compa-
rable with the gravity part. We shall be also aware that in such a case we
return to antisymmetric natural potential tensor; we would obtain

the corresponding antisymmmetric expression.

In the above considerations we tried to preserve the symmetric property
when constructing the Complex Relativity, however, it seems more natural
to admit the possibility that the perturbations into metric and to Einstein
tensor can be asymmetric or even antisymmetric.

These problems will be discussed in our next paper.

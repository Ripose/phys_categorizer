We perform a detailed analysis of the contact force network in a dense conﬁned packing of pen-
tagonal particles simulated by means of the contact dynamics method. The eﬀect of particle shape
is evidenced by comparing the data from pentagon packing and from a packing with identical char-
acteristics except for the circular shape of the particles. A counterintuitive ﬁnding of this work is
that, under steady shearing, the pentagon packing develops a lower structural anisotropy than the
disk packing. We show that this weakness is compensated by a higher force anisotropy, leading to
enhanced shear strength of the pentagon packing. We revisit “strong” and “weak” force networks in
the pentagon packing, but our simulation data provide also evidence for a large class of “very weak”
forces carried mainly by vertex-to-edge contacts. The strong force chains are mostly composed
of edge-to-edge contacts with a marked zig-zag aspect and a decreasing exponential probability
distribution as in a disk packing.

INTRODUCTION

Among singular features of granular media, force trans-
mission has received particular interest during the last
decade. The contact forces in model granular media, as
observed by experiments and numerical simulations, are
highly inhomogeneous and their probability density func-
tions (pdf’s) are wide [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. The gran-
ular texture is generically anisotropic in two respects:
1) The contact normal directions are not random; 2)
The force average as a function of contact normal di-
rection is not uniform. The corresponding fabric and
force anisotropies in shear are responsible for mechanical
strength at the scale of the packing [10, 11, 12, 13]. An-
other interesting aspect, ﬁrst analyzed in Ref. [10] is the
fact that the forces organize themselves in two distinct
classes which contribute diﬀerently to fabric anisotropy,
shear stress, and dissipation.
In particular, the shear
stress is fully transmitted via a “strong” contact net-
work, materialized by force “chains”. The stability is
ensured by the antagonist role of “weak” contacts which
prop strong force chains[10, 14].

The force transmission properties have been for the
most part investigated in the case of granular media com-
posed of isometric (circular or spheric) particles. How-
ever,
in various ﬁelds of science and engineering, the
grains are seldom so ”perfect”. For example, elongated
and platy shapes are encountered in biomaterials or phar-
maceutical applications. Such shapes have unequal di-
mensions and induce thus a degree of anisotropy in the
bulk behavior in addition to fabric and force anisotropies
[15, 16, 17, 18]. On the other hand, granular geo-

materials are often composed of angular particles with
plane faces as polyhedra. While rounded particles en-
hance ﬂowability, angular shape is susceptible to enhance
the shear strength, a factor of vital importance to civil-
engineering applications [18, 19, 20]. The railway ballast
is a well-known case where particle shape must be op-
timized to avoid excessive diﬀerential settlement under
vertical loading [21, 22, 23]. In such circumstances, the
analysis of force transmission is a key to improve perfor-
mance.

In dealing with eﬀects of particle shape, the issue is
that a general quantitative description of particle mor-
phology requires various shape parameters. For regular
polygons in 2D, for instance, the only shape parameter
is the number of sides (besides the diameter) whereas
for irregular polygons more information is needed about
the positions of the vertices in a reference system at-
tached to the particle. In soil mechanics, angularity and
roundedness are among basic parameters used to describe
particle shapes [24]. As far as force transmission is con-
cerned, at least two parameters seem to be most relevant:
1) shape anisotropy (anisometry), which contributes to
the anisotropy of stress transmission [15]; 2) facettedness,
which allows for extended (face to face, edge to face and
edge to edge) contacts between particles leading possibly
to the formation of columnar structures within a granular
assembly.

In this paper, we consider one of the simplest possi-
ble shapes, namely regular pentagons. Among regular
polygons, the pentagon has the lowest number of sides,
corresponding to the least roundedness in this category,
without the pathological space-ﬁlling properties of trian-
gles and squares. We seek to isolate the eﬀect of edge-
to-edge contacts on force transmission by comparing the
data with a packing of circular particles that, apart from
the particle shape, is identical in all respects (prepara-

tion, friction coeﬃcients, particle size distribution) to the
pentagon packing. Both packings are subjected to biaxial
compression simulated by means of the contact dynam-
ics method. The presence of edge-to-edge contacts aﬀects
both quantitatively and qualitatively the microstructure
and the overall behavior during shear. These contacts do
not transmit torques, but they are able to accommodate
force lines that are usually unsustainable in packings of
disks.

This paper is organized as follows. We ﬁrst present in
Section II the numerical procedures and a brief technical
introduction to the detection and treatment of edge-to-
edge contacts in the framework of the contact dynamics
method.
In Section III, we compare stress-strain and
volume-change characteristics. Then, In Sections IV and
V, we analyze the texture and force transmission fea-
tures.
In Section VI, we focus on the pentagon pack-
ing and we analyze the structure of force networks with
vertex-to-edge and edge-to-edge contacts. The main re-
sults are summarized and discussed in Section VII.

II. NUMERICAL PROCEDURES

The simulations were carried out by means of the con-
tact dynamics (CD) method [25, 26]. The CD method
is based on implicit time integration of the equations of
motion and a nonsmooth formulation of mutual exclusion
and dry friction between particles. This method requires
no elastic repulsive potential and no smoothing of the
Coulomb friction law for the determination of forces. For
this reason, the simulations can be performed with large
time steps compared to molecular dynamics simulations.
We used the platform LMGC90 which is a multipurpose
software developed in Montpellier, capable of modeling
a collection of deformable or undeformable particles of
various shapes [27].

A. Contact dynamics for polygons

The particles are rigid polygons exerting normal and
shear forces, fn and ft, respectively, on each other. We
attribute a positive sign to compressive normal forces.
The relative normal velocity un between two particles in
contact is counted positive when they move away from
each other. Then, the condition of geometrical contact
between two particles is expressed by the following mu-
tually exclusive alternatives:

fn > 0 un = 0
fn = 0 un > 0.

(1)

In the same way, the Coulomb friction law involves

three mutually exclusive conditions:

2

where ut is the sliding velocity at the contact and µ is
the friction coeﬃcient. The unknown variables are parti-
cle velocities and contact forces. These are calculated at
each time step by taking into account the conservation of
momenta, the constraints expressed by (1) and (2), and
the dissipation of kinetic energy during inelastic collisions
between particles (ref). We use an iterative research al-
gorithm based on a nonlinear Gauss-Seidel scheme. The
uniqueness is not guaranteed for perfectly rigid particles
in absolute terms. However, by initializing each step of
calculation with the forces calculated in the preceding
step, the set of admissible solutions shrinks to ﬂuctua-
tions which are basically below the numerical solution.
Let us note that in molecular dynamics simulations, this
“force history” is encoded by construction in the particle
positions.

The research algorithm is applied to a set of potential
contacts, identiﬁed or updated in each step. The contact
detection between two bodies consists in looking for the
overlaps of the portions of space they occupy. The treat-
ment of the mechanical interaction requires additionally
the identiﬁcation of a common tangent plane (a line in
2D). Of course, contact may take place through a larger
contact zone than a single point. Several algorithms ex-
ist for overlap determination between convex polygons
[21, 27]. In 2D simulations of the present paper, the de-
tection of contact between two convex polygonal bodies
was implemented through the so-called ”shadow overlap
method” devised by Moreau [21, 27], with reliability and
robustness tested in several years of previous applications
to various states of granular materials [18, 28, 29].

In detection of contacts between two polygons, two sit-
uations arise: 1) If a single corner is found crossing an
edge of the partner polygon, the direction of this edge
is viewed as the tangent direction. By orthogonally pro-
jecting the intruding vertex onto the edge, one determines
the penetration depth, while the nominal contact point
is chosen at the center of this distance. Below, we will
refer to this vertex-to-edge contact as “simple” contact.
2) In case of double intrusion, the common tangent line is
ﬁxed from as a mean between the two overlapping edges
and a segment of this line is identiﬁed as the contact
segment. The impenetrability between two particles at
such an edge-to-edge contact is ensured by applying the
contact laws (1) and (2) to only two points of the con-
tact segment (Fig. 1). For this reason, we refer below
to edge-to-edge contacts as “double” contacts. In prac-
tice, two forces are calculated at each double contact, but
only their resultant and application point are material.
In this respect, the choice of the two points represent-
ing a double contact does not aﬀect the dynamics of the
system.

We generated two numerical samples. The ﬁrst sample,

three diﬀerent diameters: 50% of diameter 2.5 cm, 34% of
diameter 3.75 cm and 16% of diameter 5 cm. The second
sample, denoted S2, is composed of 10000 discs with the
same polydispersity. Both samples were prepared accord-
ing to the same protocol. A dense packing was ﬁrst con-
structed following simple geometrical rules [30] and then
compressed isotropically under a constant stress σ0 = 104
Pa applied onto the right and top walls. The gravity was
set to zero in order to avoid force gradients in the sam-
ples. The coeﬃcient of friction was set to 0.4 between
grains and to 0 with the walls. At equilibrium, both nu-
merical samples were in isotropic stress state. The solid
fraction was φ0 = 0.80 for S1 and φ0 = 0.82 for S2. The
aspect ratio was h/l ≈ 2, where h and l are the height
and width of the sample, respectively. Figure 2 displays
snapshots of the two packings at the end of isotropic com-
paction.

The isotropic samples were subjected to vertical com-
pression by downward displacement of the top wall at
a constant velocity of 1 cm/s for a constant conﬁning
stress σ0 acting on the lateral walls. The simulations
were run up to a total cumulative vertical strain of 0.2
with a time step of 5.10−4 s. The CPU time was 7.10−4
s and 5.10−4 s per particle and per time step on a G5
Apple computer. Since we are interested in quasistatic
behavior, the shear rate should be such that the kinetic
energy supplied by shearing is negligible compared to the
static pressure. This can be formulated in terms of an
”inertia parameter” I [31] deﬁned by

I = ˙ε

m
p

,

r

(3)

where ˙ε = ˙y/y is the strain rate, m is the total mass,
and p is the average pressure. The quasistatic limit is
characterized by the condition I ≪ 1.
In our biaxial
simulations, I was below 10−3.

III. STRENGTH AND DILATANCY

In this section, we compare the stress-strain and
volume-change behavior between the packings of poly-

compression is vertical.

Figure 3 shows the normalized shear stress q/p for the
samples S1 and S2 as a function of shear strain εq ≡ ε1 −
ε2. For S2, we observe a classical behavior characterized
by a hardening behavior followed by (slight) softening
and a stress plateau corresponding to the residual state
of soil mechanics [24]. For S1, we observe no marked
stress peak. The residual stress is higher for polygons
(≃ 0.35) than for disks (≃ 0.28). This means that the
polygon packing has a higher angle of internal friction ϕ
deﬁned by

sin ϕ =

q
p

.

Figure 4 displays the cumulative volumetric strain εp
for polygons and disks as a function of εq. Both sam-
ples dilate and tend to isochoric deformation at large
strains.
It is remarkable that the polygon packing S1
initially dilates less than the disk packing S2. This be-
havior is reversed at larger strains with a crossover occur-
ring after the peak state. Notice that the solid fraction
is initially lower in S1 (0.80) than in S2 (0.82). This is
because it is more diﬃcult to obtain a compact pack-
ing with polygonal shapes by isotropic compression as

a result of enhanced steric eﬀects compared to disks. In
other words, angular particles can form larger pores com-
pared to rounded particles. The volumetric deformation
can also be expressed in terms of the so-called ”dilatancy
angle” ψ deﬁned by [33]

sin ψ =

εp
εq

.

(9)

The cumulative angle of dilatancy, i.e. during shear up to
the residual state, is only slightly higher for the polygon
packing than the disk packing.

The plot of ψ as a function of ϕ, i.e.

the so-called
stress-dilatancy diagram, is shown in Fig. 5 for polygons
and disks [33]. Remarkably, both plots are parallel to the
line ϕ = ψ with an oﬀset ϕ0:

ϕ ≃ ϕ0 + ψ.

(10)

The oﬀset ϕ0 is the friction angle at zero dilatancy. We
have ϕ0 ≃ 0.12 for disks and ϕ0 ≃ 0.3 for polygons.
This observation is in agreement with the arguments of
Taylor [33, 34] based on energy balance and recently re-
visited also in the case of cohesive granular media [35].
The higher level of ϕ for the polygon packing reﬂects
the organization of the microstructure and the features
of force transmission for each particle shape. This point
is considered in more detail in the following section.

IV. GRANULAR TEXTURE

The granular texture, i.e. the organization of the parti-
cles and their contacts in space, is basically controlled by
steric exclusions between the particles and force balance
conditions [36]. The texture can be described in terms
of various statistical descriptors pertaining to the force-
bearing network of particles. At the lowest order, the
compactness of the structure can be described in terms
of both the solid fraction ρ and the coordination number
z. The connectivity of the network can further be char-
acterized by the fraction P (c) of particles having exactly
c contact neighbors. These are scalar parameters or func-
tions. At higher orders, the anisotropy of the texture is
described by diﬀerent “fabric tensors”. We consider here
these geometrical descriptors in order to identify the sig-
nature of particle shape.

A. Connectivity

The connectivity of the particles by force-bearing con-
tacts is described at the lowest order by the average num-
ber z of contact neighbors per particle. The particles
with no force-bearing contact are thus removed from the
statistics. Note also that each double (edge-to-edge) con-
tact for the polygons is counted once although double
contacts are treated as two point contacts belonging to
the contact segment (see section II). Fig. 6a displays
the evolution of z for the pentagon packing (S1) and the
disk packing (S2) as a function of εq. The coordination
number evolves to a steady-state value in both samples
that is higher for S2 (≃ 3.85) than for S1 (≃ 3.75). The
diﬀerence is, however, much less important than in the
initial conﬁguration (≃ 3.95 for S2 compared to ≃ 3.20
for S1) prepared by means of isotropic compaction.

It is also interesting to compare the two samples in
terms of “contact lifetimes”. Let us consider a reference
conﬁguration, e.g. the initial state of each sample. We
follow the history of each contact listed in this state. In
particular, we deﬁne γ as the fraction of persistent con-
tacts of the initial list. During deformation, γ declines
from 1 to 0 as an increasing number of initial contacts
are lost due to particle rearrangements. Fig. 6b shows
gamma as a function of εq for S1 and S2. We see that,
following a rapid initial falloﬀ, γ decreases slowly in both
samples but the rate of contact loss is globally higher for
polygons than disks. We remark that even at εq = 0.4,
the contact list is renewed by only 50%.

The connectivity P (c) of the particles is plotted in Fig.
7 for S1 and S2 at εq = 0.3. Interestingly, the two plots
are nearly identical with a peak for c = 4. In both sam-
ples, the fraction of particles with 5 contacts is larger
than that with 3 contacts. This shows that the connec-
tivity does not reﬂect the diﬀerence in texture between
the two packings although a qualitative diﬀerence exists
as we shall see below by considering fabric anisotropy and
force transmission.

B. Fabric anisotropy

The shear strength of dry granular materials is gener-
ally attributed to the buildup of an anisotropic structure
during shear due to friction between the particles and
as a result of steric eﬀects depending on particle shape
[37, 38, 39]. Several methods have been used to quantify
the fabric (structural) anisotropy of granular materials
[13, 40, 41]. A common approach is to consider the prob-
ability distribution P (n) of the contact normals n which
are generically nonuniform. In two dimensions, the unit
vector n is described by a single angle θ, the orientation

of the contact normal. The probability density function
Pθ(θ) of contact normals provides a detailed statistical
information about the fabric. It is π-periodic in the ab-
sence of an intrinsic polarity for n.

Most structural information is generally condensed in

the second moment of Pθ, called fabric tensor [40]:

of the contact network is given the diﬀerence between
the principal values F1 and F2. We deﬁne the fabric
anisotropy a by

a = 2(F1 − F2).

For ﬁx coordinates, with the x-axis pointing along θ′, we

with cumulative shear

In both cases, a′ increases from 0 (as a result of the initial
isotropic compression) to its largest value in the residual
state. The anisotropy stays quite weak in the pentagon
packing whereas the disk packing is marked by a much
larger anisotropy, increasing to ≃ 0.3 and then relaxing
to a slightly lower value in the residual state. As we shall
see below, the low anisotropy of the pentagon packing re-
sults from a particular organization of the force network
in correlation with the orientations of simple and double
contacts in the packing (section VI). We will also show
that the large shear strength of the pentagon packing is a
consequence of a strong force anisotropy in this packing
(see next section).

V. FORCE TRANSMISSION

In this section, we analyze the anisotropy and inhomo-
geneity of force networks in the packings of pentagons
and disks. This leads us to consider the contributions of
force and texture anisotropies to average shear stresses.

a′ = 2(F1 − F2) cos 2(θF − θ′),

(13)

A. Force anisotropy

where θF is the major principal direction of the fab-
ric tensor. For θ′ = θF , we have a′ = a. The signed
anisotropy corresponds to the second term of the Fourier
expansion of Pθ(θ) and it is useful whenever the direction
of anisotropy is not constant.

Figure 8 displays a polar representation of Pθ(θ) for
the samples S1 and S2 at εq = 0.3. We observe a
nearly isotropic distribution for the pentagon packing in
spite of shearing whereas the disk packing is markedly
anisotropic. This is a surprising observation in view of
the higher shear strength of the pentagon packing (Fig.
3). It is also counterintuitive as one expects that double
contacts should allow a polygon packing to build more
easily an anisotropic structure.

The evolution of a′ is shown in Fig. 9 as a function
of εq for S1 and S2. The privileged direction of the con-
tacts, corresponding to θF , is vertical in both packings.

The angular distribution of contact forces in a granular
packing can be represented by the average force hf i(n)
as a function of the contact normal direction n. We dis-
tinguish the average normal force hfni from the average
tangential force hfti formally deﬁned by [13]

FIG. 10: Polar representation of the angle-averaged normal
(a) and tangential (b) forces hfni(θ) and hfti(θ) for the sam-

By deﬁnition, the two functions hfni and hfti are π-
periodic. After suﬃciently long monotonous shearing,
these functions can be approximated by their Fourier ex-
pansions truncated beyond the second term [13, 39]:

hfni(θ) = hf i{1 + an cos 2(θ − θn)}
hfti(θ) = hf iat sin 2(θ − θt),

(cid:26)

(15)

where hf i is the average force, an and at represent the
anisotropies of the normal and tangential forces, respec-
tively, and θn and θt are their privileged directions.

In Fig. 10, the functions hfni(θ) and hfti(θ) are dis-
played in polar coordinates at εq = 0.3. The pentagon
and disk packings show pronounced force anisotropy with
a stronger anisotropy in the case of pentagons both for
normal and tangential forces. These plots can be ﬁtted
by harmonic functions [Eq. (15)] in order to estimate the
force anisotropies an and at. However, it is more conve-

FIG. 11: Evolution of force anisotropies an (a) and at (b) as
a function of cumulative shear strain εq in samples S1 and S2.

Figure 11 shows the evolution of an and at with εq in
samples S1 and S2. We see that, in contrast to fabric
anisotropies (Fig. 9), the force anisotropies in pentagon
packing remain always above those in the disk packing.
This means that the aptitude of the pentagon packing to
develop large force anisotropy and strong force chains is
not solely dependent on the global fabric anisotropy of
the system. In section VI, we will show that the force
anisotropy of the pentagon packing stems from the high
anisotropy of the sub-network of double contacts and
strong activation of friction forces.
Indeed, due to the
geometry of the pentagons, i.e. the absence of parallel
sides, the strong force chains are mostly of zig-zag shape,
as observed in Fig. 13b, and the stability of such struc-
tures requires strong activation of tangential forces. This
explains, in turn, the large value of at for pentagons, very
close to an, whereas in the disk packing at is nearly half
of an.

The anisotropies a, an and at are interesting descrip-
tors of granular microstructure and force transmission as
they underlie the shear stress. Indeed, it can be shown
that the general expression of the stress tensor Eq. (5)
leads to the following simple relation [13, 39]:

force tensors Eq. (16). Fig. 12 shows that Eq. (18) holds
quite well both for pentagons and disks.

A remarkable consequence of Eq. (18) is to reveal the
distinct origins of shear stress in pentagon and disk pack-
ings. The fabric anisotropy provides a major contribution
to shear stress in the disk packing (Fig. 9) whereas the
force anisotropies are more important for shear stress in
the pentagon packing (Fig. 11). In this way, in spite of
the weak fabric anisotropy a, the larger force anisotropies
an and at allow the pentagon packing to reach higher lev-
els of q/p compared to the disk packing.

B. Force distributions

FIG. 13: (color online) Snapshots of normal forces in samples
S2 (a) and S1 (b). Line thickness is proportional to the normal
force.

The strong inhomogeneity of contact forces is a well-
known feature of granular media. It has been investigated
mostly for spherical or cylindrical particles both by ex-
periments and numerical simulations [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
The probability density function (pdf) of normal forces is
characterized by two features which seem to be speciﬁc
to granular media: 1) The pdf is roughly a decreasing
exponential function for forces above the mean, 2) In the
range of weak forces below the mean, the pdf does not
decline to zero with the force. The relative scatter of data
reported by diﬀerent authors for weak forces shows the
sensitivity of the pdf in this range to the details of the mi-
crostructure. But, the common observation that there is
a large number of contacts transmitting very weak forces,
is a straightforward signature of the arching eﬀect. From
this point of view, one expects that angular particle shape
will inﬂuence mainly the distribution of weak forces by
enhancing the arching eﬀect.

Figure 13 displays maps of normal forces in a portion
of each of the samples S1 and S2 at a large cumulative
strain. We observe the strong anisotropy of normal forces
in the pentagon packing compared to the disk packing (as
discussed in section V) as well as the zig-zag form of the
strong force chains. The normal force pdf’s are shown in

Fig. 14 in log-linear and log-log scales at large strains.
The forces are normalized by the mean normal force hfni
in each sample. In both samples, the number of strong
forces (above the mean hfni) falls oﬀ exponentially:

fn ∝ e−α1fn/hfni
fn ∝ e−α2fn/hfni

(cid:26)

in S1,
in S2,

(19)

with α1 ≃ 0.74 and α2 ≃ 1.4. The smaller value of
α1 means that the distribution is wider for pentagons
compared to disks. The distribution is nearly uniform in
the whole range of weak forces (fn < hfni) in S2. In the
pentagon packing S1, we observe a uniform distribution
only in the range 0.1hfni < fn < hfni. Nearly 30% of
forces are in this range. The number of “very weak”
forces in S1 in the range fn < 0.1hfni increases faster
than a power law as fn tends to zero. A fraction ≃
30% of contacts belong to this range. The presence of
numerous “very weak” forces in the pentagon packing is
a clear signature of enhanced arching eﬀect that can be
characterized, as we shall see below, by the respective
roles of simple and double contacts with respect to force
transmission.

C. Bimodal character of stress transmission

The genuine organization of contact forces in granu-
lar media, involving strong force chains propped by weak
forces, was ﬁrst analyzed by Radjai et al. by means of
contact dynamics simulations for packings of circular and
spherical particles [10]. This analysis proceeds by consid-
ering the subset of contacts which carry a force below a
cutoﬀ force ξ normalized by the mean force. This sub-
set is referred to as the “ξ-network”. The variation of
a quantity evaluated for the “ξ-network” as ξ is varied
from 0 to the maximal force in the system, provides its
correlation with the contact force. Here, we apply this
same approach to S1 and S2 samples for the stress ratio
q(ξ)/p, deﬁned as stress deviator q(ξ) (normalized by the
total pressure p of the sample) in the ξ-network, and for
a(ξ), deﬁned as the fabric anisotropy in the ξ-network.

The plot of q(ξ)/p is shown in Fig. 15 for S1 and S2 in
the residual state. In both samples, the stress deviator is
nearly zero for ξ < 1, i.e. for the normal forces below the
average force. This means that the shear stress is almost
totally sustained by the “strong” contact network ξ > 1
for the pentagon packing as well as for the disk packing.
Fig. 16 shows the fabric anisotropy a′(ξ) as a function
of ξ in the samples S1 and S2. By deﬁnition, a positive
value of a′ corresponds to the principal stress direction
whereas a negative value corresponds to the orthogonal
direction. We see that the direction of anisotropy is or-
thogonal to the principal stress direction (a′ < 0) for

FIG. 16: Partial fabric anisotropy a

cutoﬀ ξ (normalized by the mean force) in the samples S1 and
S2.

weak forces (small ξ). This “orthogonal” anisotropy of
the weak forces is more important in the pentagon pack-
ing compared to the disk packing, and, as shown in the
inset to Fig. 16, it is mainly due to “very weak” forces.
When ξ is increased beyond hfni, a′ becomes less neg-
ative and ﬁnally changes sign, showing that the strong
contacts are preferentially parallel to the principal axis.
These strong contacts are less than 40% of all contacts,
but their positive contribution to a′ overcompensates the
negative contribution weak contacts. For large ξ, the par-
tial anisotropy approaches the fabric anisotropy of the
whole system.

These data demonstrate the bimodal character of
stress transmission also in the pentagon packing in spite
of a very diﬀerent particle geometry. The mean force
plays a particular role in diﬀerentiating strong contacts
from weak contacts. However, the force pdf’s (Fig.
14) and the anisotropy of weak forces (Fig. 16) pro-
vide also evidence for the existence of a class of very
weak forces, corresponding approximately to the range
fn < 0.1hfni, within the weak network. This class is
strongly anisotropic with a privileged direction which is
orthogonal to the major principal stress direction, and
the corresponding force pdf diverges as the force tends

Large cells of strong contacts are composed of zig-zag
chains. The anisotropy of strong contacts is reﬂected in
the elongated shape of these cells along the major prin-
cipal stress direction. Both intermediate and very weak
forces prop these cells.

VI. SIMPLE VERSUS DOUBLE CONTACTS

In this section, we focus on the organization of simple
and double contacts in the pentagon packing. The double
contacts, i.e. the side-sharing polygons, are generally as-
sumed to be at the source of the higher strength of poly-
gon packings. For the texture, we would like also to inves-
tigate the proportions of simple and double contacts and
their respective contributions to the overall anisotropy of
the pentagon packing. It is also important to identify the
role of double contacts in force transmission.

FIG. 19: Proportions ks and kd of simple and double contacts,
and the corresponding relative force averages fs and fd, as a
function of cumulative shear strain εq.

The general expression [Eq. 5] of the stress tensor σ
allows us to perform a unique additive decomposition of
the stress into two parts:

σ = σs + σd,

(20)

where σs is obtained from the expression (5) by restrict-
ing the summation to simple contacts, and σd is the com-
plementary tensor involving only double contacts. The
respective stress deviators qs and qd normalized by the
mean stress p are shown in Fig. 18 as a function of
strain εq. The strength qd/p of double contacts varies
from two to three times that of simple contacts during
shear deformation of the pentagon packing. The propor-
tions ks and kd of simple and double contacts are shown
in Fig. 19 as a function of εq. The same ﬁgure dis-
plays the relative force averages fs = kshfnid/hfni and
fd = kdhfnis/hfni, where hfnis and hfnid are the mean
normal forces of simple and double contacts, respectively.
We see that kd increases with strain but remains below
ks. On the other hand, initially we have fd = fs = 0.5,
reﬂecting the isotropic state of the packing prepared by
isotropic compaction. However, fd increases with shear
up to fd ≃ 1.5fs in the residual state. This means that
the larger shear stress carried by double contacts in the
residual state is due to the larger mean normal force of
double contacts despite their smaller proportion in the
packing.

The growth of the number of double contacts shown
in Fig. 19 represents the gradual consolidation of the
sample. In Fig. 20 we plot the cumulative proportions
∆γs→d and ∆γd→s of simple contacts turning to double
and vice versa, respectively. Although transformation
between the two contact types occurs at each step in both
directions s → d and d → s, the consolidation involves
on average a net fraction of simple contacts transforming
into double contacts.

The connectivity of the pentagon packing by simple
and double contacts can be represented by the proportion
P (ms, md) of particles with exactly ms simple contacts
and md double contacts. Fig. 21 shows a grey level map

of this function for the pentagon packing in the residual
state. The row md = 0 corresponds to particles with only
simple contacts (nearly 2% of the total number of parti-
cles) whereas the columnms = 0 represents the particles
with only double contacts (nearly 6%). On average, a
particle has more simple contacts than double contacts
but the maximum occurs at ms = md = 2.

We now consider the fabric tensor decomposed in a
similar way as the stress tensor [Eq. (20)] into two partial
tensors:

F = Fs + Fd,

(21)

where Fs and Fd are deﬁned as F in Eq. (11) by simply
restricting the summation to simple and double contacts,
respectively, and by dividing the sum by the total num-
ber Nc of contacts. The respective anisotropies a′
s and
a′
d of simple and double contacts are displayed in Fig.
22 as a function of εq. The interesting observation here
is that the simple contacts have a negative anisotropy
which, according to Eq. (13), means that simple contacts
are mostly oriented perpendicular to the major principal
fabric direction θF .
In other words, most simple con-
tacts belong to the weak network. In contrast, the double

contacts have an increasing positive anisotropy which is
larger than the mean anisotropy a of the sample. This
is consistent with the fact that the double contacts take
over larger forces and they contribute more to the shear
stress than simple contacts.

The normal force pdf’s for simple and double contacts
are shown in Fig. 23. Both contact types are involved in
weak and strong networks and the pdf’s have the same
functional form. But the contribution of simple contacts
is more important in the range of very weak forces. Once
again, as for anisotropy, the very weak contacts appear to
be related to the particular geometry of the pentagons.
At large strains, about 32% of all contacts belong to
the very weak force network with 25% simple contacts
against 7% double contacts. A snapshot of the normal
force network is shown in Fig. 24 where the line widths
are proportional to the line width with diﬀerent colors
(or grey levels) for simple and double contacts. The re-
markable feature of this map is the network of very strong
zigzag force chains composed mostly of double contacts
and occasionally mediated by simple contacts.

interesting to remark that the fraction of weak contacts,
i.e. kW
d ≃ 0.58 in the residual state is very close to
that (0.62) in the case of the disk packing.

pentagon packing was found to develop a lower struc-
tural (fabric) anisotropy compared to the disk packing
under shear. This low fabric anisotropy, however, does
not prevent the pentagon packing from building up a
strong force anisotropy that underlies its enhanced shear
strength compared to the disk packing.

This ﬁnding is interesting as it shows unambiguously
that the force anisotropy in a granular material has two
distinct sources: (1) Fabric anisotropy, with a maximum
value depending on particle shapes; (2) Particle shapes.
The ﬁrst mechanism is crucial for the disk packing so
that the force anisotropy, and the shear stress as a re-
sult, vanishes in an isotropic disk packing (e.g. when the
friction coeﬃcient is set to zero). The second mechanism
may be the predominant source of strength for “facetted”
particles that can give rise edge-to-edge (in 2D) or face-
to-face (in 3D) contacts allowing for strong force localiza-
tion along such contacts in the packing. Since the fabric
anisotropy is low in a pentagon packing, the role of force
anisotropy and thus the local equilibrium structures or
arching are important with respect to its overall strength
properties. The pentagons analyzed in this work provide
thus the ﬁrst counter-example of a system where the role
of fabric anisotropy in shear strength is marginal.

Another shape-related eﬀect was the observation of zig-
zag force chains mostly composed of edge-to-edge con-
tacts in steady shearing. The vertex-to-edge contacts
belong thus mainly to the weak force network or a class
of “very weak” forces that can be considered as a signa-
ture of enhanced arching or screening eﬀect of forces in
the presence of edge-to-edge chains. These “very weak”
forces can also be observed, though to a lesser extent,
in a disk packing with high coeﬃcients of friction [8]
or on experimental pdf’s of normal forces acting on the
walls of a container [5]. Let us recall that a “very weak
phase” was also evidenced by considering the correlation
between friction mobilization and the anisotropy of gran-
ular texture in a disk packing at the stability limit [14].
By focusing on pentagon packings, we were able

VII. CONCLUSION

The objective of this paper was to isolate the eﬀect of
particle shape on force transmission in granular media by
means a detailed comparison between two similar pack-
ings with diﬀerent particle shapes: pentagons vs. disks.
We observed enhanced shear strength and force inhomo-
geneity in the pentagon packing. But, unexpectedly, the

to demonstrate the nontrivial phenomenology resulting
from the speciﬁc shape of particles as compared to a disk
packing. Although general features of force transmis-
sion (pdf’s, bimodal character, etc) seem to be robust,
the details of force transmission (relative importance of
force and fabric anisotropy, the role of edge-to-edge con-
tacts, etc) seem to be strongly shape-dependent. Cur-

rently, we work to elucidate this issue for regular poly-
gons (hexagons and higher number of sides) as well as
polyhedral particles in three dimensions.

Abstract

We present a general method to deal with singularities at the origin of
a polar coordinate system in three dimensional space.
Its power derives
from the fact that it is designed so that the Gauss theorem is correct for any
distribution with a ﬁnite number of isolated point-like singularity.

The method is applied to show the intrinsic difference between the dipole
and dimonopole ﬁelds of classical electrodynamics, to the solution of the
wave equation for a general time varying source, as well as to the causal
Green’s function of that equation.

While the method is essentially equivalent to many others, it is consistent
and systematic, as well as providing some new insight which may prove
useful for the physical interpretation of point-like singularities.

Introduction

The problem of dealing in a consistent and systematic manner with singularities
arising at the origin of a polar coordinates system is a recurring question in the
teaching of classical electrodynamics [1, 2] as well as in research [3, 4].

The standard solution is rather pragmatic: it consists of introducing an appro-
priate delta-function whenever the derivative of an expression that is singular at
the origin is a distribution rather than zero. Typical examples are the “rules” for
getting the divergence of the Coulomb ﬁeld

~∇ ·

~x
|~x|3 =

|~x|2 δ(|~x|) = 4πδ3(~x) ,

and the Laplacian of the Coulomb potential

= ~∇ · ~∇

= −4πδ3(~x) .

(1.2)

While these formulas are perfectly correct, as can be veriﬁed in a number of ways,
it would be desirable to have an algorithm such that the “delta-functions” appear
at the right place without having to remember when this or that expression yields
a distribution instead of zero. Moreover, one would like to have a technique
signiﬁcantly easier to use than the general method based on distribution theory,
which has the disadvantage to have been designed much more to satisfy the needs
of mathematicians than those of physicists or engineers.

In this paper we present such a method. It is based on the rigorous applica-
tion of distribution theory to the elementary case of a single, isolated point-like
singularity of a scalar or vector ﬁeld over R3, which therefore may be considered
as being located at the origin of a spherical coordinate system. This method can
immediately be extended to a ﬁeld containing a ﬁnite number of isolated point
singularities, or to a continuous distribution of point singularities as will be done
in Section 7 for the wave equation with a continuous source by means of its
Green’s function. However, the method cannot easily be extend to topologically
more complicated cases such as, for example, the Dirac or Schwinger magnetic
monopoles which have a potential with a line-like singularity, i.e.,

~AD =

g
|~x|

~x × ~u
r − ~x · ~u

,

~AS =

g
|~x|

(~r · ~u) (~x × ~u)
|~x|2 − (~x · ~u)2

,

(1.3)

where ~u is a unit vector [5]. For similar reasons the distributions considered in
this paper will always be continuous in the angular variables.

The essence of the method consists of writing the ﬁeld under consideration in
such a way that there is no ambiguity with regards to how to calculate its derivatives
at every point, including the origin where it may be singular. This is explained
and justiﬁed in Section 2, where an effort is made to be as correct as possible,
but without pretending to a rigor such that professional mathematicians would be
fully satisﬁed. In particular, as little mathematical background as possible is used,
and the reader interested by the details is referred to the numerous publications in
which the theory of distributions is presented.1

As an introduction to our method it is useful to brieﬂy consider the simpler
one-dimensional case of a scalar ﬁeld over R+. Suppose therefore that we have a

modern presentation [10].

function f (r ≥ 0) : R+ → R which is singular, i.e., unbounded, at r = 0. What
does distribution theory say in that case about the structure of the singularity? That
a distribution which has its support only in one point, say the origin, is a linear
combination of the delta-function and its derivatives up to a certain order.2 Thus,
if f (r) is restricted to just r = 0, it can be written as

f{0}(r) =

dnδ(n)(r) =

(1.4)

where the derivatives of Dirac’s delta-function δ(x) have been expressed as

δ(x) , δ(2)(x) = +

x2 δ(x) , δ(3)(x) = −

2
x3 δ(x) , etc.

(1.5)

However, since distributions can be integrated and differentiated just like or-
dinary functions, we can integrate equation (1.4) to yield a distribution which will
not necessarily be restricted to r = 0. To do this we take for the primitive of δ(x)
not the usual “Heaviside step-function” H(x), but (for reasons that will become
clear in Section 2) the “upsilon-function” (or “sign-function”) Υ(x) deﬁned as

Υ(x) :=

=

|x|

x
|x|

d
dx

(1.6)

which is related to δ(x) by the equations

Υ(1)(x) = 2δ(x)

,

δ(−1)(x) =

Υ(x) + C .

(1.7)

Using the elementary identity

x δ(x) = 0 ,

(1.8)

it is then easy to verify that the primitives of Υ(x) can be written as

Υ(−1)(x) = xΥ(x) , Υ(−2)(x) =

Υ(x) , Υ(−3)(x) =

Υ(x) , etc. (1.9)

Consequently, by integrating equation (1.4) we get a more general distribution

However, this is not the most general distribution singular at the origin. What is
missing are terms containing a negative power of r. Therefore, while (1.10) can
be seen as a kind of generalization of the Taylor series of a regular function, the
corresponding generalization of the Laurent series to a distribution f (r) : R+ → R
that is singular at r = 0 can be written as3

rk Υ(r) .

(1.11)

In this expression we have merged the constant C which comes from (1.7) with
the constant b0 which appears in (1.10), and replaced them by CΥ(r). This is
to highlight that (1.11) has to be interpreted as a distribution, i.e., as an equiva-
lence class of generalized functions such that CΥ(r) and C represent the same
generalized function — as well as to make explicit that when differentiated such
a distribution over the half -space [0, +∞] yields a delta-function contribution at
the origin even though C is a constant. However, we have introduced the terms
with a negative power of r without a justiﬁcation for the factor Υ(r): this will be
done in Section 2 where it will be shown that this factor is necessary in order for
the Gauss theorem to be true, as will be proved in the Appendix.

The key feature of expression (1.11), which was here derived in an heuristic
way, is that everything is deﬁned in such a way that there is no ambiguity for
differentiating or integrating it. The purpose of Section 2 will therefore be to
give a better mathematical foundation to this expression, which can in principle
be generalized to any function f (r) : R+ → Rn that is singular at r = 0.
However, to remain within the realm of classical mechanics and electrodynamics,
that section will just consider scalar and vector functions over R3, i.e., functions
of the form s(~x) and ~V (~x), which may be taken separately, or in combination as
a quaternion function Q(~x) = s(~x) + ~V (~x). This has the merit that both cases
can be treated simultaneously, and that considerable advantage can be derived
from the properties of Hamilton’s quaternion algebra H, which is deﬁned by the
non-commutative product4

(a + ~A)(b + ~B) = ab − ~A · ~B + a ~B + b ~A + ~A × ~B .
3We conﬁne ourselves to series with a ﬁnite number of terms, which avoid the difﬁculties
associated with the singularities at zero of distributions such as the logarithm, or as the derivative
of the hyperbolic cotangent [6].

(1.12)

4The quaternion product is a direct generalization of the complex number product, which was
deﬁned by Hamilton as (a + iA)(b + iB) = ab − AB + iaB + ibA. Because of the minus sign on
the right-hand side one has to remember that the square of a real vector is negative. For example,
the Laplace operator is ∆ = ~∇ · ~∇ = −~∇2 .

where a, b ∈ R are scalars and ~A, ~B ∈ R3 are vectors.5 In particular, this unique
multiplication rule will be used in the Appendix to formulate Gauss’s theorem in
such a way that it contains all its different forms at once [7].

In Section 3 our method is applied to the most simple non-trivial case: the
monopole singularity of a Coulomb or Newton point charge. This example will
illustrate that this method does not necessarily lead to results that are absolutely
identical to those obtained by other methods, but that they are nevertheless equiv-
alent with them when properly interpreted.

In Sections 4 and 5 the potentials, ﬁelds, and sources, of the dipole and
It will be shown that despite that the
dimonopole singularities are studied.
dimonopole is a scalar-potential-singularity, and the dipole a vector-potential-
singularity, they produces identical ﬁelds, except at the origin where the two
singularities produce different delta-function-like ﬁelds. It will also be seen that
while the derivation of this important result is generally somewhat indirect in
standard textbooks, it derives rigorously from a straightforward application of the
present method.

In Sections 6 and 7 our method is applied to the solution of the wave equation
for a general time varying source, and to the causal Green’s function of that
equation. These slightly more complicated applications illustrate the power of the
method, which provides in a straightforward manner a solution that is more general
than the one derived in most textbooks, and yields the causal Green’s function of
the wave equation for the potential of Maxwell’s ﬁeld with considerable ease and
additional insight into its physical interpretation.

2 Distributions in polar coordinates

In this section we present a general method which uses distribution theory to
deal with functions that are singular at the origin of a spherical polar coordinates
system. This method is based on Tangherlini’s algorithm for differentiating at the
origin in polar coordinates [3, p.511–513]. While it is equivalent to those used in
standard textbooks for dealing with simple cases such as the Newton or Coulomb
ﬁelds, and is occasionally used for solving problems such as ﬁnding the Green’s
function of electrostatics [10, p.51], this method allows a straight-forward and
consistent treatment of a large class of point-like singularities.

We consider differentiable scalar- or vector-valued function over R3, i.e., in

5This product can be used with biquaternions, i.e., complexiﬁed quaternions in which the scalar

and vector parts may be complex.

general, quaternion-valued functions6

~x −→ F (~x) = s(~x) + ~v(~x) ∈ H .

(2.1)

We suppose that F is everywhere regular except possibly at one point ~x0 which we
take as the origin of a polar coordinate system: ~x −~x0 = ~r(r, θ, φ).7 Moreover, we
suppose that F is continuous in the angular variables θ and φ. We now interpret
the function F (~x − ~x0) as a distribution in the variable ~r. We therefore write

F (~x − ~x0) := F (~r)Υ(r) ,

(2.2)

where F (~r) ∈ C∞ over R3−{0}, while F (~r)Υ(r) is assumed to be inﬁnitely
differentiable in the sense of distributions over R3, as well as “weakly convergent”
which means that for any “test function” T (~r) we have8

d3Ω F (~r)Υ(r)T (~r) ∈ H .

(2.3)

R3

The scalar distribution Υ(r) has been introduced in (2.2) to specify how to differ-
entiate at the origin.9 It is postulated to have the properties

Υ(r) = 1 , ∀r > 0 ,

(2.4)

and

d3Ω F (~r)Υ(r) =

d3Ω F (~r) , ∀F (~r) ∈ H ,

(2.5)

Z Z Z

Z Z Z

which due to (2.3) imply that F (~r)Υ(r) and F (~r) are equivalent with regards to
weak convergence and therefore correspond to the same distribution. However, the
value Υ(0) does not need to be known, or even to exist, as long as (2.2) is weakly
convergent. In fact, the only property that matters is that Υ(r) is discontinuous at
r = 0. In the theory of distributions this means that its derivative is of the form10

d
dr

Υ(r) = a δ(r)

(2.6)

6The use of quaternions, i.e., the original form of vector calculus, is most appropriate here
since it allows a simultaneous treatment of both scalar and vector functions. The generalization to
biquaternion-valued functions is immediate. However, the full generalization to functions over the
biquaternion algebra B, or even to functions over C3, is difﬁcult since the structure of singularities
is substantially more complicated in these cases.

7We assume r = |~r| and the usual parametrization such that θ ∈ [0, π] and φ ∈ [0, 2π], so that

r ≥ 0, contrary to Tangherlini who allowed for r < 0.

8A test function is an inﬁnitely differentiable bounded function with compact support.
9Note that we write Υ(r) rather than Υ(~r). This is an implicit postulate that a distribution Υ(r)

which is symmetrical about the origin is adequate to deal with point-like singularities.

10Strictly speaking, this derivative could be a ﬁnite linear combination of δ(r) and its derivatives.

In order to determine a we require that the Gauss theorem in its various forms

d2Σ F (~r)Υ(r) ≡

represented by the sequence11

(2.15)

In conclusion, by means of the deﬁnition (2.2), where the Υ-function stipulates
how to differentiate at the origin, it is possible to make all calculations with
distributions in polar coordinates in a systematic and consistent manner.12
In
particular, as shown in the Appendix, it appears that the Gauss theorem is always
true, even if there are singularities at the origin, provided they are consistent with
(2.2) and (2.5).

3 Monopole singularity

Starting from the Coulomb potential of a point-charge,

ϕm(~r) := e

which may be either an electric-monopole of charge e, or a magnetic-monopole if
e is replaced by ie, we get the ﬁeld

r3 Υ(r) − e

~r
r2 2δ(r)

and the rationalized source charge distribution

−4πρm(~r) = −~∇ · ~Em = e

2
r2 δ(r) .

There are two differences between these distributions and the usual “textbook”
expressions for the Coulomb ﬁeld and its source charge distribution. First, there
is the δ-function term on the right of (3.2). This is a solution of the homogeneous
equation ~∇Em(~r) = 0 which therefore can always be added to any solution of the

11Note that instead of (2.8) one could formally adopt the normalization

0 dx δ(x) = 1. In
this case one would avoid the factors “ 1
R
2 ” in (2.13) and “2” in (2.14). However, this is inconsistent
if the same symbol “δ” is used for both δ(r) and Dirac’s δ(x). In order to remind that we keep
Dirac’s normalization (2.8) and use (2.14) in polar coordinates, we will always write mnemonically
“2δ(r)” for the derivative of Υ(r).

12Using a more heuristic method, the same conclusion was reached in [1, 2].

inhomogeneous equation. Second, there is the factor of 2 on the right of (3.3),
which when integrating over r is taken care of by the normalization (2.13). In
particular, the charge of the source is

q =

Z Z Z

d3Ω ρm(~r) = e .

(3.4)

4 Dipole singularity

The dipole singularity, which through extensive experimental veriﬁcation is found
to very precisely characterize the intrinsic magnetic dipole moment of elementary
particles such as the electron, is given by the vector potential

~Ad(~r) :=

~µ × ~r
r3 Υ(r)

where |~µ | has the dimension of a charge times a length. The calculation of the
magnetic ﬁeld is straightforward. We get

~Hd(~r) =

(4.2)

The ﬁrst term in this expression is well-known, but the one with a δ-function
is rarely mentioned in textbooks. However, when integrated over 3-space, this
second term gives the contribution [11, p.184]

d3Ω 2δ(r)

~r × (~µ × ~r)

which is essential in calculating the hyperﬁne splitting of atomic states [12].

We can now calculate the sources. As expected, the magnetic charge density

is zero

while the rationalized current density is

−4πρd(~r) = ~∇ · ~Hd(~r) = 0 ,

−4π~jd(~r) = ~∇ × ~Hd(~r) = −3

~r × ~µ
r4 2δ(r) .

Using this current density we can now calculate the magnetic moment by means
of the standard expression [11, p.181] to get

~m =

d3Ω ~r × ~jd(~r) = ~µ .

Therefore, although there are actually no “circulating currents” in the point-like
distribution (4.5), the magnetic moment calculated with the formula derived for a
localized current distribution gives the correct answer.

5 Dimonopole singularity

The dimonopole singularity corresponds to the ﬁeld produced by two electric (or
magnetic) monopoles of opposite charge separated by an inﬁnitesimal distance
|~λ|. The potential for such a ﬁeld is therefore

Υ(r) −

Υ(r) .

At large distance, or at vanishingly small separation ~λ, we can take for this potential
the ﬁrst term of the Taylor development, i.e.,

ϕdm(~r) ≈ +e(~λ · ~∇)

= −e(~λ · ~r)

(5.2)

1
r

r3 .

From there on it is possible to calculate the ﬁeld and the source by either recursively
applying the gradient operator on (5.2), or by applying the operator (~λ · ~∇)( ) on
the ﬁeld (3.2) and the source (3.3) of a point charge. Either way, we get for the
ﬁeld the expression

~Hdm(~r) =

~r(~µ · ~r)

Υ(r) −

2δ(r) ,

(5.3)

where we have deﬁned

~µ = e~λ .

(5.4)

Expression (5.3) is remarkably similar to the corresponding expression (4.2) for
an intrinsic dipole, and it can be seen that the difference between a dipole and a
dimonopole ﬁeld is entirely contained in the point-like singularity at the origin,
i.e.,

~Hd(~r) − ~Hdm(~r) =

~r × (~µ × ~r)
r4

2δ(r) +

2δ(r) =

~r · (~µ · ~r)

It is this difference which enables to conclude that the

dipolar ﬁelds from distant stars are produced by magnetic dipoles, rather than by
magnetic dimonopoles [12].

10

We can now calculate the sources. As expected, the current density is zero

−4π~jdm(~r) = ~∇ × ~Hdm(~r) = 0 ,

while the rationalized charge density is

−4πρdm(~r) = ~∇ · ~Hdm(~r) = −3

~r · ~µ
r4 2δ(r) ,

i.e., a distribution that is odd in ~r so that the total charge is zero, as it should be for
a dimonopole. We can ﬁnally calculate the ﬁrst moment of this charge density by
means of the standard expression for a charge distribution [11, p.137]. This gives

~d =

Z Z Z

d3Ω ~rρdm(~r) = ~µ = q~λ ,

a result which illustrates again that despite the great similarity of their ﬁelds at a
distance from the origin, the dipole and dimonopole singularities are in fact very
different.

6 The wave equation with a time-varying source

the nonhomogeneous equation13

(6.1)

(cid:16)

r2 2δ(r)

where C ∈ B is the 4-current source of the 4-potential A ∈ B. When the source
reduces to a scalar function of time s(t), and under some appropriate conditions
to be speciﬁed later, the standard solutions to this equation as given in many
textbooks, e.g., [8, p.697], are

∇∇

1
r2 2δ(r) ,

(6.2)

where the minus sign corresponds to the so-called “retarded,” and the plus sign to
the so-called “advanced,” solution. These solutions are interpreted by remarking
that the scalar potential ϕ(t, ~r) = s(t − r)1/r corresponds to the physical situation
in which the ﬁeld at the space-time point [t; ~r] is caused by the action of the source
13Note that a factor 4π may appear in this equation and its solutions if δ3(~r) is used on the right,

or if the source current C is related to the electric current J by a rationalization convention.

11

at the “retarded” time t − r, where r corresponds to the time taken by photons to
travel the distance r = |~r| at the velocity c = 1.

Let us see if we can derive this equation by means of the method presented in

this paper, namely by calculating the expression

∇∇

s(t ∓ r)
r

Υ(r) = ?

without making any more assumptions on s(t ∓ r) than that it is a distribution.
After a short calculation we get

s(t ∓ r)

Υ(r) = −

s(t) − 2rs′(t)

(cid:16)

1
r2 2δ(r)

(cid:17)

which differs from (6.2) by the term containing the product of r times the ﬁrst
derivative of s(t). Thus, equation (6.4) is an identity which could correspond to a
more general solution of the nonhomogeneous wave equation in which the source
s(t) is replaced by s(t)2rs′(t). Indeed, this is the case because the solution (6.2)
is subjected to the condition that [8, p.695]

lim
̺→0 Z Z

d2~Σ · ~∇

= −s(t) ,

where ̺ is the radius of a small sphere surrounding the origin, which implies that

lim
r→0

rs′(t ∓ r) = lim
r→0

rs′(t) = 0

so that (6.4) is indeed equivalent to (6.2) under this condition.

7 The causal Green’s function of the wave equation

Since (6.4) is a solution of the wave equation for any distribution, we can apply it
to the case where the source is strictly point-like, i.e., to

which, because

δ(t∓r) which cannot be eliminate by the conditions (6.5) or (6.5). However, since
we interpret (7.3) as a distribution, we have the weak convergence requirement

for any test function T (r), where the second expression comes from the identity
rδ(r) = 0. Thus, (7.3) is equivalent to

∇∇

δ(t ∓ r)

Υ(r) = −δ(t)

Consequently, the distribution G(t, r), which is generally written as

G(t, r) =

Υ(r) ∼=

H(t) ,

solves the nonhomogeneous wave equation (6.2) for a point-like source located
at one given time at the origin of the coordinate system. It is called the Green’s
function14 of that equation. On the right of equation (7.6) our upsilon-function Υ(r)
is replaced by the Heaviside-function H(t) to conform to the standard formulation,
e.g., [10, p.107], [11, p.225,p.610]. In the retarded case these two formulations
are strictly equivalent because the delta-function δ(t − r) insures that t = r > 0.

The solution (7.6) is also called the fundamental (or elementary) solution
because it yields the general solution by means of a convolution integral.
In
particular, it is easy to recover by means of the Green’s function the solution (6.2)
for a source s(t) satisfying the condition (6.5).
In effect, by deﬁnition of the
δ-function, we have

s(t) =

dτ s(t − τ )δ(τ ) .

Thus, by applying that convolution operation on the left-hand side of (7.5), we get

dτ s(t − τ )G(τ, r) =

The most general solution, including non-trivial initial conditions, is obtained by
a slightly more complicated convolution operation. See, e.g., [10, p.105].

8 Conclusion

In this paper we have presented a new general method to work in spherical coordi-
nates with distributions which are singular at the origin. As was to be expected, the
results are essentially equivalent to those obtained with other methods, but there
are some differences which may shed a new light on some aspects of the theory.

For instance:

• In the monopole case we have found that the ﬁeld comes with a singular
contribution at the origin, see (3.2). While such delta-function-like contri-
butions do not play an explicit role in classical electrodynamics, they are
essential in QED where the lead to effects such as the Lamb shift of the
energy levels in atoms.

• In the dipole and dimonopole cases we have found the exact distributional
form of the delta-function-like difference of the ﬁelds at the origin, a differ-
ence which in most papers, e.g., [13], and textbooks, e.g., [11], is only dealt
with in the integral forms (4.3) and (5.7).

• Finally, for the nonhomogeneous wave equation, we have found a Green’s
function (7.6) which is characterized by the presence of the upsilon-function
Υ(r) instead of the Heaviside-function H(t). While these two formulations
of the Green’s function are equivalent, at least in the retarded case, it remains
to be seen whether subtle differences between them15 may have implications
for the interpretation or internal consistency of classical and quantum elec-
trodynamics.

To conclude, and as complement to the heuristic remarks made in the intro-
duction, it might be useful to add that the method explained in this paper can be
related to an important rule that is often attributed to Dirac’s [14, p.61]. Indeed,
the equation xδ(x) = 0 shows that, whenever one divides both sides of an equation
by a variable x which can take on the value zero, one should add on to one side an
arbitrary multiple of δ(x), i.e., from an equation

one cannot infer

Similarly, if A and B are taken as distributions of the polar variable r, which

may be singular at r = 0, from the equation

one cannot infer

which may therefore be taken as the deﬁning rule for the method explained in this
paper.

10 Appendix: Gauss theorem in polar coordinates

In this appendix we give an elementary, and possibly incomplete, proof of our
conjecture that the Gauss theorem (2.9), which we rewrite here as

d2Σ F (~r) =

d3Ω ~∇F (~r)Υ(r) ,

(10.1)

Z Z
∂Ω

Z Z Z
Ω

is true for any weakly convergent quaternion-valued distribution F (~r)Υ(r) which
may have a singularity at r = 0. Developing the right hand side, and using the
deﬁning property (2.5), we get

d2Σ F (~r) =

d3Ω ~∇F (~r) +

d3Ω

F (~r)2δ(r) ,

which is the standard form of the Gauss theorem for the function F (~r), except for
the second term on the right which takes into account the singularity at the origin.

As F (~r) is quaternion valued, equation (10.2) contains all forms of the
Gauss theorem, namely the so-called “gradient-,” “divergence-,” and “rotational-
theorems” at once [7, vol.II, p.439]. For the sake of completeness, we recall the
deﬁnition of the quaternion product

(a + ~A)(b + ~B) = ab − ~A · ~B + a ~B + b ~A + ~A × ~B .

(10.3)

Since F (~r) is supposed to be ﬁnite and differentiable everywhere except at
r = 0, the theorem is true by any standard proof for any volume which does
not contain the origin. We then proceed as in any standard analysis of point-like
singularities, namely we surround the origin by a small sphere and verify the
theorem for the leading singularity. However, for simplicity, we postpone to a
more complete proof the cases where the origin in on the surface of the volume Ω,
and the one where Ω is multiply connected.

From now one the volume Ω is therefore an ordinary 3-ball of radius R, ∂Ω
its surface, and the function F (~r) the leading singularity.
If F (~r) is simply a
scalar function f (r), which does not depend on the angular variables, the theorem
reduces after angular integration to the identity 0 = 0. This remains so after
multiplying both sides of (10.2) by a constant vector, so that to deal with non
trivial singularities we must consider expressions containing the vector ~r. The
most simple such expression is

F (~r) =

~r
rn

which is singular at r = 0 for n ≥ 1. For the 3-ball we have

d2Σ = dωr2~r
r

and

d3Ω = dωr2dr .

(10.5)

Thus, after some elementary calculation, the three terms appearing in (10.2) be-
come

(10.8)

where the minus signs comes from the deﬁnition (10.3), i.e., ~r~r = −r2. Therefore,
by comparing (10.7) and (10.8), we see that the second term on the right hand
side of (10.2) has the remarkable effect of removing the divergent term at r → 0
which should not be there according to (10.6), and, moreover, in the case n = 3, of
correcting equation (10.7) so that instead of zero it gives the same value as (10.6).
In other words, this second term “repairs” the usual formulation of the Gauss
theorem in such a way that it becomes true for all functions of the type (10.4).

We have therefore proved the identity

d2Σ

~r
rn =

Z Z Z
Ω

Z Z
∂Ω

d3Ω ~∇

~r
rn Υ(r)

(10.9)

which is still valid if we multiply it by a constant vector ~c. Since ~r~c = −~r ·~c+~r ×~c,
this means that the Gauss theorem is also true for the functions ~r·~c/rn and ~r×~c/rn,
which correspond to generic cases of the “divergence-” and “rotational-” theorems.
Moreover, since these scalar and vector products enable to project the radius vector
on any axis or plane of the polar coordinate system, they can be combined with
suitable scalar functions to yield any possible function of r, θ, and φ, which may
be singular for r = 0, so that the Gauss theorem in the forms (10.1) or (10.2)
should be true for any such function.

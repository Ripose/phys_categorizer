Abstract. We explain connections of the Evans-Vigier model with theories
proposed previously. The Comay’s criticism is proved to be irrelevant.

The content of the present talk is the following:

Theorem[2, 3];

− Evans-Vigier deﬁnitions of the B(3) ﬁeld [1];
− Lorentz transformation properties of the B(3) ﬁeld and the B-Cyclic
− Clariﬁcations of the Ogievetski˘ı-Polubarinov, Hayashi and Kalb-Ramond
− Connections between various formulations of massive/massless J = 1
− Conclusions of relativistic covariance and relevance of the Evans-Vigier

papers [4, 5, 6];

postulates.

In 1994-2000 I presented a set of papers [7] devoted to clariﬁcations of
the Weinberg (and Weinberg-like [8, 9]) theories and the concept of Ogievet-
ski˘ı-Polubarinov notoph. In 1995-96 I received numerous e-mail communi-
cations from Dr. M. Evans, who promoted a new concept of the longitudinal
phaseless magnetic ﬁeld associated with plane waves, the B(3) ﬁeld (which is
later obtained the name of M. Evans and J.-P. Vigier). Reasons for continu-
ing the discussion during 2-3 years were: 1) the problem of massless limits of
all relativistic equations does indeed exist; 2) the dynamical Maxwell equa-
tions have indeed additional solutions with energy E = 0 (apart of those

2

with E = ±|κ|, see [10, 11, 12, 13, 14];1 3) the B(3) concept met strong
non-positive criticism (e. g., ref [15, 16, 17]) and the situation became even
more controversial in the last years (partially, due to the Evans’ illness).

What are misunderstandings of both the authors of the B(3) model and
their critics? In Enigmatic Photon (1994), ref. [1], the following deﬁnitions
of the longitudinal Evans-Vigier B(3) ﬁeld have been given:2

Deﬁnition 1. [p.3,formula (4a)]

B(1) × B(2) = iB(0)B(3) ⋆ ,

et cyclic.

Deﬁnition 2. [p.6,formula (12)]

B(3) = B(3) ⋆ = −

iκ2
B(0)

A(1) × A(2) ,

and

Deﬁnition 3. [p.16,formula (41)]

B(3) = B(0)ˆk .

(3)

(4)

(5)

The following notation was used: κ is the wave number; φ = ωt− κ· r is
the phase; B(1) and B(2) are usual transverse modes of the magnetic ﬁeld;
A(1) and A(2) are usual transverse modes of the vector potential.

The main experimental prediction of Evans [1a,b] that the magnetiza-

tion induced during light-matter interaction (for instance, in the IFE)

M = αI 1/2 + βI + γI 3/2 where

I =

0 , E0 = c|Bπ|

(6)

has not been conﬁrmed by the North Caroline group [18]. As one can see
from Figure 4 of [18] “the behaviour of the experimental curve does not
match with Evans calculations”.

Nevertheless, let us try to deepen understanding of the theoretical con-
tent of the Evans-Vigier model. In their papers and books [1] Evans and

1If we put energy to be equal to zero in the dynamical Maxwell equations

∇ × [E − iB] + i(∂/∂t)[E − iB] = 0 ,
∇ × [E + iB] − i(∂/∂t)[E + iB] = 0 .

(1)
(2)

we come to ∇ × E = 0 and ∇ × B = 0, i. e. to the conditions of longitudinality. The
method of deriving this conclusion has been given in [19].

2I apologize for not citing all numerous papers of Evans et al and papers of their

critics due to page restrictions on the papers of this volume.

Vigier used the following deﬁnition for the transverse antisymmetric tensor
ﬁeld:

If B(0) = E(0) this formula describes the right-polarized radiation. Of
course, a similar formula can be written for the left-polarized radiation.
These transverse solutions can been re-written to the real ﬁelds. For in-
stance, Comay presented them in the following way [16c] in the reference
frame Σ:

E⊥ = cos[ω(z − t)]ˆi − sin[ω(z − t)]ˆj ,
B⊥ = sin[ω(z − t)]ˆi + cos[ω(z − t)]ˆj ,

(8)

(9)

and analized the addition of B|| = √2ˆk to (9). Making boost to other frame
of reference Σ′ he claimed that a) B(3) ′ is not parallel to the Poynting
vector; b) with the Evans postulates E(3) ′ has a real part; c) transverse
ﬁelds change, whereas B(3) is left unchanged when the boost is done to the
frame moving in the z direction. Comay concludes that these observations
disprove the Evans claims on these particular questions. Furthermore, he
claimed that the B(3) model is inconsistent with the Relativity Theory.

According to [20, Eq.(11.149)] the Lorentz transformation rules for elec-

tric and magnetic ﬁelds are the following:

E′ = γ(E + cβ × B) −
B′ = γ(B − β × E/c) −

system c = ¯h = 1. After introducing the spin matrices (Si)jk = −iǫijk and
deriving relevant relations:

(S · β)jkak ≡ i[β × a]j ,

βj βk ≡ [β 2 11 − (S · β)2]jk ,

Pure Lorentz transformations (without inversions) do not change signs of
the phase of the ﬁeld functions, so we should consider separately properties
of the set of B(1) and E(1), which can be regarded as the negative-energy
solutions in QFT and of another set of B(2) and E(2), the positive-energy
solutions. Thus, in this framework one can deduce from Eqs. (12,13)

We know that the longitudinal mode in the Evans-Vigier theory can be con-
sidered as obtained from Deﬁnition 3. Thus, considering that B(0) trans-
forms as zero-component of a four-vector and B(3) as space components of
a four-vector: [20, Eq.(11.19)]

B(0) ′ = γ(B(0) − β · B(3)) ,
B(3) ′ = B(3) +

γ − 1
β2

(β · B(3))β − γβB(0) ,

(23)

(24)

we ﬁnd from (22) that the relation between transverse and longitudinal
modes preserves its form:

B(1) ′ × B(2) ′ = iB(0) ′B(3) ∗ ′ ,

(25)

that may be considered as a proof of the relativistic covariance of the B(3)
model.

Moreover, we used that the phase factors in the formula (7) are ﬁxed
between the vector and axial-vector parts of the antisymemtric tensor ﬁeld
for both positive- and negative- frequency solutions if one wants to have
pure real ﬁelds. Namely, B(1) = +iE(1) and B(2) = −iE(2). As we have just
seen the B(3) ﬁeld in this case may be regarded as a part of a 4-vector with
respect to the pure Lorentz transformations. We are now going to take oﬀ
the abovementioned requirement and to consider the general case:

(cid:18) B⊥
E⊥(cid:19)′

˜E(2)(cid:19) e−iφ(cid:27) =

= Λ(cid:26)(cid:18) ˜B(1)
= Λ(cid:26)(cid:18)

˜E(1)(cid:19) e+iφ +(cid:18) ˜B(2)
eiα(xµ) ˜B(1)(cid:19) e+iφ +(cid:18)

˜B(1)

(26)

˜B(2)

−eiβ(xµ) ˜B(2)(cid:19) e−iφ(cid:27) .

Our formula (26) can be re-written to the formulas generalizing (6a) and
(6b) of ref. [2] (see also above (18,19)):

Bi (1) ′ =  1 + ieiαγ(S · β) +
Bi (2) ′ =  1 − ieiβγ(S · β) +

(28)

One can then repeat the procedure of ref. [2] (see the short presentation
above) and ﬁnd out that the B(3) ﬁeld may have various transformation
laws when the transverse ﬁelds transform with the matrix Λ which can
be extracted from (12,13). Since the Evans-Vigier ﬁeld is deﬁned by the

6

formula (3) we again search the transformation law for the cross product of

We used again the Deﬁnition 3 that B(3) = B(0)ˆk.

One can see that we recover the formula (8) of ref. [2] (see (22) above)
when the phase factors are equal to α = −π/2, β = −π/2. In the case
α = +π/2 and β = +π/2, the sign of β is changed to the opposite one.3
But, we are able to obtain the transformation law as for antisymmetric
tensor ﬁeld, for instance when α = −π/2, β = +π/2.4 Namely, since under
this choice of the phases

B(1) ′ × B(2) ′ = iγhB(0)i2 ˆk −

(30)

the formula (30) and the formula for opposite choice of phases lead precisely
to the transformation laws of the antisymmetric tensor ﬁelds:

(31)

B(0) is a true scalar in such a case.

What are reasons that we introduced additional phase factors in Hel-
moltz bivectors? In [21] a similar problem has been considered in the
(1/2, 0) ⊕ (0, 1/2) (cf. also [7, 22]). Ahluwalia identiﬁed additional phase
factor(s) with Higgs-like ﬁelds and proposed some relations with a grav-
itational potential. However, the E ﬁeld under deﬁnitions (α = −π/2,
β = +π/2) becomes to be pure imaginary. One can also propose a model
with the corresponding introduction of phase factors in such a way that

3By the way, in all his papers Evans used the choice of phase factors incompatible
with the B-Cyclic Theorem in the sense that not all the components are entries of anti-
symmetric tensor ﬁelds therein. This is the main one but not the sole error of the Evans
papers and books.

4In the case α = +π/2 and β = −π/2, the sign in the third term in parentheses

(formula (30) is changed to the opposite one.

WHAT IS THE EVANS-VIGIER FIELD?

B⊥ to be pure imaginary. Can these transverse ﬁelds be observable? Can
the phase factors be observable? A question of experimental possibility of
detection of this class of antisymmetric tensor ﬁelds (in fact, of the anti-
hermitian modes on using the terminology of quantum optics) is still open.
One should still note that several authors discussed recently unusual con-
ﬁgurations of electromagnetic ﬁelds [23, 24].

Let us now look for relations with old formalisms. The equations (10)

of [4] is read

fµν(p) ∼ [ǫ(1)

µ (p)ǫ(2)

ν (p) − ǫ(1)

ν (p)ǫ(2)

µ (p)]

(32)

for antisymmetric tensor fµν expressed through cross product of polariza-
tion vectors in the momentum space. This is a generalized case comparing
with the Evans-Vigier Deﬁnition 2 which is obtained if one restricts oneself
by space indices.

The dynamical equations in the Ogievetski˘ı-Polubarinov approach are

2fµν − ∂µ∂λfλν + ∂ν∂λfλµ = Jµν ,

(33)

and the new Kalb-Ramond gauge invariance is deﬁned with respect to trans-
formations

δfµν = ∂µλν − ∂ν λµ .

(34)

It was proven that the Ogievetski˘ı-Polubarinov equations are related to the
Weinberg 2(2j + 1) formalism [25, 26] and [7b-f,i].

Furthermore, they [4] also claimed “In the limit m → 0 (or v → c) the
helicity becomes a relativistic invariant, and the concept of spin loses its
meaning. The system of 2s + 1 states is no longer irreducible; it decom-
poses and describes a set of diﬀerent particles with zero mass and helicities
±s,±(s − 1), . . . ± 1, 0 (for integer spin and if parity is conserved; the situ-
ation is analogous for half-integer spins)5.” In fact, this hints that actually
the Proca-Duﬃn-Kemmer j = 1 theory has two massless limit, a) the well-
known Maxwell theory and b) the notoph theory (h = 0). The notoph
theory has been further developed by Hayashi [5] in the context of dila-
ton gravity, by Kalb and Ramond [6] in the string context. Hundreds (if
not thousands) papers exist on the so-called Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld (which is
actually the notoph), including some speculations on its connection with
Yang-Mills ﬁelds.

5Cf. with [27]. I am grateful to an anonymous referee of Physics Essays who sug-
gested to look for possible connections. However, the work [27] does not cite the previous
Ogievetski˘ı-Polubarinov statement.

In [28] I tried to use the Ogievetski˘ı-Polubarinov deﬁnitions of fµν (see
(32)) to construct the “potentials” fµν. We can obtained for a massive ﬁeld

This tensor coincides with the longitudinal components of the antisym-
metric tensor obtained in refs. [9a,Eqs.(2.14,2.17)] (see also below and [7i,
Eqs.(16b,17b)]) within normalizations and diﬀerent forms of the spin basis.
The longitudinal states reduce to zero in the massless case under appro-
priate choice of the normalization and only if a j = 1 particle moves along
with the third axis OZ.6 Finally, it is also useful to compare Eq. (35) with
the formula (B2) in ref. [29] in order to realize the correct procedure for
taking the massless limit.

Thus, the results (at least in a mathematical sense) surprisingly depend

on a) the normalization; b) the choice of the frame of reference.

In the Lagrangian approach we have

(38)

(if one applies the duality relations). Thus, we observe that a) it is impor-
tant to consider the parity matters (the dual tensor has diﬀerent parity
properties); b) we may look for connections with the dual electrodynam-
ics [30].

The above surprising conclusions induced me to start form the ba-
sic group-theoretical postulates in order to understand the origins of the
Ogievetski˘ı-Polubarinov-Evans-Vigier results. The set of Bargmann-Wigner
equations, ref [31] for j = 1 is written, e.g., ref. [32]
[iγµ∂µ − m]αβ Ψβγ(x) = 0 ,
[iγµ∂µ − m]γβ Ψαβ(x) = 0 ,

(39)

(40)

6There is also another way of thinking: namely, to consider “unappropriate” normal-
ization N = 1 and to remove divergent part (in m → 0) by a new gauge transformation.

(41)

In order to facilitate an analysis of parity properties of the corresponding
ﬁelds one should introduce also the term ∼ (γ5σµν R)αβ ˜fµν. In order to
understand normalization matters one should put arbitrary (dimensional,
in general) coeﬃcients in this expansion or in deﬁnitions of the ﬁelds and
4-potentials [28]. The R matrix is

R =(cid:18) iΘ

0 (cid:19) .
0 −iΘ(cid:19) , Θ = −iσ2 =(cid:18) 0 −1

Matrices γµ are chosen in the Weyl representation, i.e., γ5 is assumed to
be diagonal. The reﬂection operator R has the properties

RT = −R , R† = R = R−1 ,
R−1γ5R = (γ5)T ,
R−1γµR = −(γµ)T ,
R−1σµνR = −(σµν )T .

(43)
(44)
(45)
(46)

They are necessary for the expansion (41) to be possible in such a form,
i.e., in order the γµR, σµνR and (if considered) γ5σµν R to be symmetrical
matrices.

I used the expansion which is similar to (41)

Ψ{αβ} = γµ

αδRδβFµ + σµν

and obtained

(49)

If one renormalizes F µ → 2mAµ or Fµν → 1
2m Fµν one obtains “textbooks”
Proca equations. But, physical contents of the massless limits of these equa-
tions may be diﬀerent.

Let us track origins of this conclusion in detail. If one advocates the

the normalization of the wave functions in the momentum representation
is thus chosen to the unit, ǫ∗µ(p, h)ǫµ(p, h) = −1.9 We observe that in the
massless limit all deﬁned polarization vectors of the momentum space do
not have good behaviour; the functions describing spin-1 particles tend to
inﬁnity. This is not satisfactory, in my opinion, even though one can still
claim that singularities may be removed by rotation and/or choice of a
gauge parameter. After renormalizing the potentials, e. g., ǫµ → uµ ≡ mǫµ
we come to the ﬁeld functions in the momentum representation:

7Remember that the invariant integral measure over the Minkowski space for physical

Therefore, we use the ﬁeld operator as in (54). The coeﬃcient (2π)3 can be considered
at this stage as chosen for convenience. In ref. [33] the factor 1/(2Ep) was absorbed in
creation/annihilation operators and instead of the ﬁeld operator (54) the operator was
used in which the ǫµ(p, h) functions for a massive spin-1 particle were substituted by
uµ(p, h) = (2Ep)−1/2ǫµ(p, h), which may lead to confusions in searching massless limits
m → 0 for classical polarization vectors.

8In general, it may be useful to consider front-form helicities (or “time-like” polariza-
tions) too. But, we leave a presentation of a rigorous theory of this type for subsequent
publications.

9The metric used in this paper gµν = diag(1, −1, −1, −1) is diﬀerent from that of

ref. [33].

and at the rest (Ep = p3 → 0) also vanishes. Thus, such a ﬁeld operator
describes the “longitudinal photons” which is in complete accordance with
the Weinberg theorem B − A = h for massless particles (let us remind that
we use the D(1/2, 1/2) representation). Thus, the change of the normaliza-
tion can lead to the change of physical content described by the classical
ﬁeld (at least, comparing with the well-accepted one). Of course, in the
quantum case one should somehow ﬁx the form of commutation relations
by some physical principles.1

If one uses the dynamical relations on the basis of the consideration of

polarization vectors one can ﬁnd ﬁelds:

where we denoted, as previously, a normalization factor appearing in the
deﬁnitions of the potentials (and/or in the deﬁnitions of the physical ﬁelds
through potentials) as N . E(p, 0) and B(p, 0) coincide with the strengths
obtained before by diﬀerent method [9a,28], see also (35). B±(p, 0t) =
E±(p, 0t) = 0 identically. So, we again see a third component of anti-
symmetric tensor ﬁelds in the massless limit which is dependent on the
normalization and rotation of the frame of reference.

However, the claim of the pure “longitudinal nature” of the antisym-
metric tensor ﬁeld and/or “Kalb-Ramond” ﬁelds after quantization still
requires further explanations. As one can see in [5] for a theory with
L = − 1
ij (x),j)|Ψ >= 0 (in
our notation ∂µf µν = 0), see the formula (18a) therein, leads to the above
conclusion. Transverse modes are eliminated by a new “gauge” transforma-
tions. Indeed, the expanded lagrangian is

Thus, the Ogievetski˘ı-Polubarinov-Hayashi Lagrangian is equivalent to the
Weinberg’s Lagrangian of the 2(2j + 1) theory [36] and [7a-e],2 which is
constructed as a generalization of the Dirac Lagrangian for spin 1 (instead
of bispinors it contains bivectors). In order to consider a massive theory (we
insist on making the massless limit in the end of calculations, for physical
quantities) one should add + 1

4 m2fµνf µν as in (37).

The spin operator of the massive theory, which can be found on the

basis of the N¨other formalism, is

2The formal diﬀerence in Lagrangians does not lead to physical diﬀerence. Hayashi

said that this is due to the possiblity of applying the Fermi method mutatis mutandis.

WHAT IS THE EVANS-VIGIER FIELD?

In the above equations we applied dynamical equations as usual. Thus, it
becomes obvious, why previous authors claimed the pure longitudinal na-
ture of massless antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld after quantization, and why the
application of the generalized Lorentz condition leads to equating the spin
operator to zero.3 But, one should take into account the normalization is-
sues. An additional mass factor in the denominator may appear a) after
“re-normalization” L → L/m2 (if we want to describe long-range forces an
antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld must have dimension [energy]2 in the c = ¯h = 1
unit system, and potentials, [energy]1 in order the corresponding action
would be dimensionless; b) due to appropriate change of the commutation
relations for creation/annihilation operators of the higher-spin ﬁelds (in-
cluding ∼ 1/m); c) due to divergent terms in E, B, A in m → 0 under
certain choice of N . Thus, one can recover usual quantum electrodynamics
even if we use ﬁelds (not potentials) as dynamical variables.

The conclusions are:
− While ﬁrst experimental veriﬁcations gave negative results, the B(3)
construct is theoretically possible, if one develops it in a mathematically
correct way;

− The B(3) model is a relativistic covariant model. It is compatible with
the Relativity Theory. The B(3) ﬁeld may be a part of the 4-potential
vector, or (if we change connections between parts of Helmoltz bivec-
tor) may be even a part of antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld;

− The B(3) model is based on deﬁnitions which are particular cases of
the previous considerations of Ogievetski˘ı and Polubarinov, Hayashi
and Kalb and Ramond;

− The Duﬃn-Kemmer-Proca theory has two massless limits that seems
to be in contradictions with the Weinberg theorem (B − A = h);
− Antisymmetric tensor ﬁelds after quantization may describe particles
of both helicity h = 0 and h = ±1 in the massless limit. Surprisingly,
the physical content depends on the normalization issues and on the
choice of the frame of reference (in fact, on rotations).

I acknowledge many internet communications of Dr. M. Evans (1995-96)
on the concept of the B(3) ﬁeld, while frequently do not agree with him in
many particular questions. I acknowledge discussions (1993-98) with Dr. D.
Ahluwalia (even though I do not accept his methods in science).

3It is still interesting to note that division of total angular momentum into orbital

part and spin part is not gauge invariant.

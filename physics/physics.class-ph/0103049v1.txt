Abstract

The dispersion relation and mode amplitudes of oblique surface waves propagating on an acoustic

double comb ﬁlter are obtained with a method based on the calculus of residues. We obtain a better

agreement (below 480 Hz) between theoretical predictions and measurements reported previously

when the ﬁlter was being supposed to be made of a single comb structure.

INTRODUCTION

The behavior of a slow wave ﬁlter made of a pair of planar periodic waveguides subjected

to low frequency acoustic waves incident upon the aperture separating the waveguides has

been investigated theoretically and experimentally for its potential use in acoustic ﬁltering

devices [1]. Each waveguide has a comb structure consisting of a periodic array of blades

perpendicular to a base plane (Figure 1).

Using a mathematical model borrowed from the study of electrical ﬁlters, a ﬁlter having

the same geometric structure of a single comb waveguide has been analyzed previously [1].

The dispersion relation, amplitude and phase as functions of frequency and wave number

were derived and compared to experiment. In this work, we extend our previous theoretical

results and consider the actual nature of the ﬁlter consisting of the two waveguides facing

each other. We derive the dispersion relation and reﬂection (transmission) coeﬃcients of

surface waves propagating along any oblique wave number in the plane parallel to the comb

structure base planes.

Our calculations are based on a weak-coupling approximation and in the limit of

large distance separating the two structures. This means the separation is much larger

than the inter-blade distance. The blades are supposed to have a vanishingly small

thickness and we neglect possible reﬂections from the planar base aﬀecting the propa-

gating modes, by direct analogy with the electromagnetic case [2]. This is equivalent to

assuming a slot depth large with respect to the inverse lowest attenuation of the structure [2].

Our work is organized as follows: In section II, we discuss the geometry, propagating

modes dispersion and amplitude relation for the surface waves. Section III covers the com-

parison with the experimental results and the conclusion is in Section IV.

II. DISPERSION RELATION, MODES AND AMPLITUDES

Periodic arrays of slotted waveguides stacked to form a rectangular [3] or prismatic

[4] structure are good candidates for reducing environmental noise (0.1 to 2 kHz). Their

2

properties have been analyzed theoretically and experimentally [1, 3, 4] such as their

reﬂection scattering of sound waves harmful to the general population living near highways

or other sources of damaging sources of low frequency noise. It is important to understand

how these structures absorb, reﬂect, transmit or phase delay the incoming sound waves

reaching them with arbitrary time dependent angles. For the rectangular structure, we

have already undertaken such study from the experimental point of view as well as from the

theoretical one. In this work, we set out to investigate a new type of structure introduced

in detail in Ref. 1 theoretically and experimentally (Fig. 1).

We have studied the dispersion relation of acoustic waves impinging on the structure at an

arbitrary ﬁxed angle in the base plane, and measured the sound reﬂection and transmission

with respect to the incident angle. Our prior theoretical investigation took account of a

single comb structure only. Here we extend it and deal with a symmetrical weakly- coupled

double comb structure [5] in the limit b

d ≫ 1 where b is half the distance between the tip
of the blades belonging to each of the waveguides and d is the inter-blade distance in any

waveguide (Fig. 1).

Following our notation [1], we write for the acoustic ﬁelds in region A (free space) keeping

than in true free space by the ratio β2 + τ 2
deﬁned by the inequalities: νd − d

In order to ﬁnd the dispersion

equation of the surface waves and the coeﬃcients Am, Bm, we will proceed as we did in our

previous work following the approach pioneered by Whitehead [7] and Hurd [2]. It consists

of writing the equations of continuity for the ﬁelds ΦAand ΦB and their derivatives along the

vertical y axis on the boundaries y = ±b. These equations are considered as originating from

Cauchy’s theorem of residues for a meromorphic function f (w) taken along some contour

and the contribution of each pole is identiﬁed with the contribution of some corresponding

mode. The contour and f (w) should be such that the presumed theorem of residues is

satisﬁed. Moreover, the asymptotic behavior of f (w) is tailored by the underlying physical

problem and is basically dictated by the scattering of the waves by the edges of the blades

[7]. We obtain the following meromorphic function f (w) of the complex variable w:

f (w) =

This equation is the same as that obtained by Hougardy and Hansen [6] who treated

a single comb structure from the electromagnetic point of view. Here, we are dealing

with the weak coupling symmetric case limit and with the additional simplifying as-

sumptions:

b
d ≫ 1, α0b ≫ 1 and α−p ∼ β−p. We ﬁnd that the dispersion relation is
essentially the same as in the case of a single comb structure. The double comb structure

simply behaves as a single one from the dispersion relation point of view. This justiﬁes

our assumptions in Ref.

1 where we found very good agreement between theory and

experiment up to frequencies on the order of 400 Hz. Nevertheless this is not true for

reﬂection (transmission) coeﬃcients of the single/double comb structures as discussed below.

In order to calculate the mode amplitudes and obtain from them the reﬂection (trans-

mission) coeﬃcients of the structure, we use the residue of f (w) at w = αn:

Res[f (w)]w=αn = Anβnejβnd/2cosh(αnb)

where Γ stands for the Euler Gamma function. For negative values of n, it suﬃces to

change αn into −αn in the above expression. Let us note that when the separation 2b

between the two parts of the structure, becomes very large we recover exactly the expression

found by Hougardy and Hansen [6] corresponding to a single comb structure.

Let us note that the Bn coeﬃcients are the same as those obtained by Hougardy and

Hansen [6] reﬂecting the fact, the weak- coupling approximation aﬀects in a diﬀerent way

the An and the Bn coeﬃcients. This has important implications on our measurements of

the amplitude proﬁle.

III. COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENT

In our previous work, we derived the dispersion relation, transmission and reﬂection

coeﬃcients and found excellent agreement between the single comb structure theory and

experiment up to 400 Hz [1]. This work shows that a weak coupling between two comb

structures does not aﬀect the surface wave dispersion relations and the Bn amplitude

coeﬃcients but it does aﬀect the An amplitude coeﬃcients.

We are going to evaluate how our theory modiﬁes the amplitude ratio |A0|

|B0| associated
with the fundamental mode (n=0) in relation (10) compared with same given in Lahlou et

al. [1]. The double comb over single comb structure ratio of the two expressions is given by:

F (θ) =

eα0b
2cosh(α0b)

(13)

For a given frequency and a given incident angle θ we solve the dispersion relation given

by equation (8), obtain the propagation factor α0 and use it in (13). The corrections F(θ)

in dB are plotted versus θ in the interval [1, 80] degrees for various frequencies [400-600 Hz]

in Fig.2.

The correction comprised between 0 and -3 dB is small for higher frequencies and small

incident angles. It decreases rapidly for angles larger than 10 to 20 degrees and by a larger

amount for higher frequencies. A comparison to the experimental data reveals that the

correction is pronounced mostly at higher frequency (336 Hz) and for the largest angle of

incidence (47 degrees). For the highest experimental frequencies (480 and 496 Hz), the

correction introduces more disagreement between the experimental and theoretical single

comb structure theory. This behavior may be explained by the fact that there are several

sources of errors associated with the measurements at these higher frequencies.

IV. CONCLUSION

We have developed a weak coupling theory based on the calculus of residues in order to

model the oblique propagation of acoustic waves propagating through a slow wave ﬁlter made

of a pair of comb structured waveguides separated by a distance that is large with respect to

the inter-blade distance. The correction arising from the symmetrical coupling between the

two waveguides has been evaluated and shown to improve slightly the agreement between

the theoretical and the experimental values of Lahlou et al. [1] being at the most 3 dB for

the largest frequency and angle evaluated. Those results show that the approximation taken

in our previous investigation is quite acceptable and that the new theory does not bring

7

substantial additional accuracy to our previous single comb structure model. Our studies of

the strong coupling case (b < d) being mathematically much more complicated, and intended

for improving the agreement between the theoretical results and the experimental ones at

the higher frequencies are in progress and will be reported in the near future.

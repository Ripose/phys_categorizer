Based on an analogy between Fluid Mechanics and Electromagnetism, we claim that the gauge
conditions of Classical Electromagnetism are not equivalent contrary to the common belief. These
”gauges” are usually considered as mathematical conditions that one must specify in order to solve
any electromagnetic problem. Here, the author shows that these conditions are physical constraints
which can be interpreted as electromagnetic continuity equations. As a consequence, light cannot
be considered as a pure transverse wave in vacuum from the point of view of the potentials. We
discuss the (lack of) meaning of gauge transformations.

INTRODUCTION

In Classical Electromagnetism, the generalized mo-
mentum p of a particle with mass m and charge q
moving at a velocity v in a vector potential A is [1] :
p = mv + qA. Hence, the vector potential can be seen
as the electromagnetic impulsion (per unit of charge) of
the ﬁeld. For example, induction phenomena are due to
the transfer of momentum from the ﬁeld to the charge
via the vector potential. Simply speaking, the vector po-
tential is a kind of velocity up to a factor q/m. There
is a long history of papers ([2, 3] and references therein)
and of books which advocate forcefully a physical inter-
pretation to the vector potential ([4, 5, 6, 7] and refer-
ences therein). One can deﬁne the vector potential at a
point M as the mechanical impulsion that an external
operator must furnish to a unit charge in order to bring
it from inﬁnity (where the vector potential vanishes far
from the currents) to the point M. The generalized en-
ergy ǫ of the same particle in a scalar potential V is [1] :
ǫ = mv2/2 + qV . Hence, the scalar potential can be seen
as the potential energy (per unit of charge) of the ﬁeld.
For example, an electron is accelerated in an electron gun
and its gained energy per unit charge is the scalar poten-
tial. Of course, the potentials are deﬁned up to a constant
and the experimentalist sets by convention the scalar po-
tential of a plate in the electron gun to zero for instance.
Similarly, one can deﬁne the scalar potential at a point
M as the mechanical energy that an external operator
must furnish to a unit charge in order to bring it from
inﬁnity (where the scalar potential vanishes far from the
charges) to the point M.

Usually, in order to solve a problem in Electromag-
netism, one must specify what is called a gauge, that
is a supplementary condition which is injected in the
Maxwell equations expressed in function of the electro-
magnetic potentials. Two gauge conditions were intro-

duced in Classical Electromagnetism [1] : ∇ · A = 0
which is the Coulomb gauge, used for example in magne-
tostatics, and : ∇ · A + 1/c2
L∂tV = 0 which is the Lorenz
gauge. Here, cL is the velocity of light [1] : cL = p1/µ0ǫ0
where µ0 and ǫ0 are respectively the permeability and the
permittivity of the vacuum. It is common to say that
these gauge conditions are mathematical conveniences
that lead to the same determination of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld. In this context, the choice of a speciﬁc gauge
is motivated from its conveniences in calculations !

We would like to underline that these gauges may not

be equivalent :

– From the mathematical point of view, the Coulomb
gauge is the approximation of the Lorenz gauge in
the stationary case -which is a well known result -
but also when the velocity of light is taken to be
inﬁnite (what this paper will demonstrate...).

– From the physical point of view, the gauges can be
seen as electromagnetic continuity equations. To un-
derstand this last point, one can use the following
analogy with hydrodynamics.

THE ANALOGUE PROOF OF THE
NON-EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN THE GAUGE
CONDITIONS

In order to solve a problem in ﬂuid mechanics, one
must specify a physical constraint which tells us if the
ﬂuid ﬂow is compressible or not. The incompressibility
constraint reads [8] : ∇ · u = 0 whereas the compress-
ibility constraint is [8] : ∇ · u + 1/ρDtρ = 0 where
Dt = ∂t() + (u · ∇)() is the so-called total derivative, u
is the velocity of a ﬂuid particle and ρ its density. If the
ﬂow is not stationary and if one considers acoustic waves
which are perturbations of the pressure, the density and
the velocity of the ﬂuid around a basic state (subscript

2

0) p = p0 + δp, ρ = ρ0 + δρ and u = 0 + δu, one can
evaluate the velocity of sound by the following formula
[8] : cS = p∂p/∂ρ = p1/ρκ where κ is the compressibil-
ity of the ﬂuid. The compressibility constraint becomes :
∇ · δu + 1/c2
S∂t(δp/ρ0) = 0 which has a form equivalent
to the Lorenz gauge. If the velocity of sound tends to in-
ﬁnity, one recovers the incompressibility constraint. The
new result is that the Coulomb gauge would imply that
the velocity of light tends to inﬁnity in a time dependent
problem when propagation is absent as in hydrodynamics
[9]. Moreover, if the ﬂow is stationary, the compressibil-
ity constraint reduces to the incompressibility constraint
which is analogous to the Coulomb gauge.

determined or not, the so-called gauges conditions seem
to be physical constraints which would tell us if the ve-
locity of light is a relevant parameter or not (that is ﬁnite
or not) and not mathematical conditions to ﬁx the po-
tentials. Indeed, depending on what type of phenomena
you are studying, some imply that the velocity of light is
ﬁnite and some other do not. More precisely, is there a
consistent galilean electromagnetism (cL is inﬁnite) coex-
isting with a relativistic electromagnetism (cL is ﬁnite) ?
This question was addressed and answered for the ﬁelds
by L´evy-Leblond & Le Bellac [10] and it was revisited
recently by Holland & Brown [11]. Our paper extends
these last works for the gauge conditions.

THE EXPERIMENTAL PROOF OF THE
NON-EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN THE GAUGE
CONDITIONS

THE MATHEMATICAL PROOF OF THE
NON-EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN THE GAUGE
CONDITIONS

Now, one can read in every textbooks of electromag-
netism that we can describe propagation of potential
waves in either the Coulomb or the Lorenz gauge because
in any case the propagation of the electromagnetic waves
remains unchanged... We will show that the Coulomb
constraint cannot describe propagation at ﬁnite speed
but instantaneous propagation in a coaxial cable.

What does it mean experimentally that a quantity
propagates instantaneously ? Imagine the following ex-
periment. Let’s take a coaxial cable. One can relate it to
a function generator which delivers for instance a scalar
potential pulse of whatever shape : square, triangular...
Experimentally, the scalar potential seems to propagate
instantaneously in a short coaxial cable of one meter long.
We are in the so-called quasi-static limit where quantities
are time-dependent but do not propagate (with the help
of the analogy, one understand that we should use the
Coulomb constraint). Experimentally, the scalar poten-
tial does not propagate instantaneously in a long coaxial
cable of one hundred meter long because we are able to
detect with an oscilloscope a time delay introduced by the
ﬁnite speed propagation of a pulse of scalar potential be-
tween the entry and the exit of the cable. This last exper-
imental fact is in contradiction with the assertion that we
can use Coulomb gauge to describe propagation because
the scalar potential is solution of a Laplace equation in
this gauge that is, it must propagate instantaneously [1].
From the analogy, one concludes that we should use the
Lorenz constraint to describe propagation and not the
Coulomb constraint. Of course, one also uses Coulomb
constraint in the time-independent case. A close look to
the range of validity of the so-called quasi-stationary ap-
proximation (cL is inﬁnite) permits to understand that
there is no contradiction with the above statement con-
cerning the fact that the potentials and the ﬁelds can or
can not propagate depending on the problem...

To conclude this part, whatever the potentials are un-

As a matter of fact, L´evy-Leblond & Le Bellac have
shown that the full set of Maxwell equations has two well
deﬁned galilean limits which they called the magnetic
limit (used for example in Ohmic conductors and in Mag-
netohydrodynamics ([12, 13]) : also called the magneto-
quasistatic approximation) and the electric limit (used
for example in dielectrics and in Electrohydrodynamics
([13, 14, 15]) : also called the electro-quasistatic approx-
imation). The two limits are obtained by taking the ve-
locity of light as inﬁnite. Contrary to mechanics which
allows only one galilean limit, the two limits of electro-
magnetism come from the fact that cL = p1/µ0ǫ0 can
tend to inﬁnity if either µ0 or ǫ0 tends to zero separately.
For example, the magnetic limit is the result of keeping
µ0 constant during the process while ǫ0 tends to zero.

Moreover, L´evy-Leblond & Le Bellac have derived the
galilean transformations for the potentials [10]. In the
magnetic limit (u << cL and V << cL.|A|), they read :
A∗ = A and V ∗ = V − u.A whereas in the electric
limit (u << cL and V >> cL.|A|) : A∗ = A − u/c2
LV
and V ∗ = V . Now, if we apply the limiting process
used by these authors (u << cL and V << cL.|A| or
V >> cL.|A|) to the Lorenz gauge which, we know, is
Lorentz invariant (cL is ﬁnite), we ﬁnd that the Lorenz
gauge resumes to the Coulomb gauge in the magnetic
limit and that the Lorenz gauge remains the same in the
electric limit. The Lorenz (Coulomb) gauge is now covari-
ant with respect to the ”electric” (”magnetic”) transfor-
mations of the potentials. The Coulomb gauge is the only
possible constraint that we can apply when we deal with
Ohmic conductors or in Magnetohydrodynamics that is
within the range of the magnetic limit. The Coulomb
gauge cannot apply in the electric limit as well as in rel-
ativistic electromagnetism which was not recognized be-
fore. The important point is that the Coulomb gauge is
obtained mathematically by a limiting process from the
Lorenz gauge and is not independent of the Lorenz gauge.

We clearly state that it is hence forbidden to plunge
the Coulomb gauge which is galilean into the full set of
Maxwell equations which are relativistic contrary to what
is stated in almost all the textbooks. The Lorenz gauge
describes both relativistic electromagnetism and galilean
electromagnetism within the electric limit and it cannot
apply in the magnetic limit.

Once again, the analogy can help us to grasp the un-
derlying physics. If a ﬂow is said to be incompressible,
the velocity of sound is considered to be inﬁnite. More
precisely, the compressibility of the ﬂuid tends to zero
while the density is kept constant. Moreover, we char-
acterized usually media where waves propagate by using
the concept of impedance which for an acoustic wave is
Zs = ρ0cs and for a light wave is ZL = µ0cL. Hence, µ0
is the analogue of ρ0. Now, we can remark easily that the
magnetic limit is the analogue of an incompressible ﬂow
while there is no mechanical counterpart for the elec-
tric limit. One understands why the Coulomb gauge is
the only gauge which does apply in Ohmic conductors
within the magnetic limit which are analogous to Newto-
nian ﬂuids in incompressible ﬂow [9]. Recently, Brown &
Holland [16] have shown that the Schroedinger equation
which is a galilean equation was only coherent with the
use of the magnetic limit which explains why we use the
Coulomb gauge with this equation when dealing with an
electron in a vector potential.

One century ago, H.A. Lorentz noticed that the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld remains invariant (E′ = E and B′ = B)
under the so-called gauge transformations [17] : A′ =
A + ∇f and V ′ = V − ∂tf where f (x, t) is the gauge
function. Hence, this indetermination is believed to be an
essential symmetry of Classical Electromagnetism [17].
We showed that the Coulomb and Lorenz gauges were
not equivalent because they must be interpreted as phys-
ical constraints that is continuity equations. So, to make
a gauge choice is not related to the fact of ﬁxing a spe-
cial couple of potentials. Gauge conditions are completely
uncorrelated to the supposed indetermination of the po-
tentials. The gauge choice must be taken with respect to
the type of electromagnetism we study that is relativistic
or not by taking care also of the type of galilean limit.
What is the meaning of gauge transformations ? We be-
lieved that it is only a structural feature (that is linearity)
of the deﬁnitions of the potentials from the ﬁelds. The po-
tentials of Classical Electromagnetism do have a physical
meaning as recalled in the introduction. If we deﬁned the
ﬁelds from the potentials and not the contrary, the gauge
transformations loose their sense.

As a conclusion, we propose to reject gauge transfor-
mations. Gauge invariance is preserved but in a weaker
sense : the potentials are deﬁned up to a constant. The
proposed rejection of gauge transformations is not new in
the literature : it was foreseen by L. de Broglie in the ap-
plication of the principle of inertia of energy in relativity
[18]. More recently, A. Van Oosten proposed a non-gauge-

3

invariant theory of electromagnetism based on the Fermi
Lagrangian which is a valid alternative to the standard
approach as it makes the same experimental predictions
[19].

THE NATURE OF LIGHT

Now, we can have a closer look to the way the prop-
agation of light is described usually. One can ﬁnd for
example in The Classical Theory of Fields by Landau &
Lifshitz [20] the following description. Thanks to gauge
invariance, one can take the Coulomb gauge ∇ · A = 0
and the assumption that the scalar potential is zero in
order to describe light propagation. As a matter of fact,
one obtains : E = −∂tA − ∇V = −∂tA and B = ∇ × A.
The vector potential (so the ﬁelds) is solution of a prop-
agation equation. From our point of view, this derivation
is misleading because the Coulomb gauge is not Lorentz
invariant and we advocated in this paper that it can not
describe propagation (cL is inﬁnite). Indeed, if we apply
a Helmholtz decomposition to the Lorenz gauge (cL is
ﬁnite), one ﬁnds : ∇ · Alongitudinal + 1/c2
L∂tV = 0 and
independently : ∇ · Atransverse = 0. The magnetic ﬁeld
is : B = ∇×Atransverse with : ∇×Alongitudinal = 0. The
electric ﬁeld writes : E = −∂tA − ∇V = −∂tAtransverse
with : ∂tAlongitudinal + ∇V = 0.

Indeed, concerning the nature of light, one can wonder
if light should still be considered as a transverse wave.
As a matter of fact, the potentials do have a physical
meaning in Classical Electromagnetism as recalled in the
introduction. Moreover, we gave a physical interpreta-
tion of the gauge and particularly of the Lorenz gauge
which implies by Fourier transform : V = cLAx where
x is the direction of propagation of a plane light wave
in vacuum (k = ω/cL). Hence, if we can say - as usual
- that the longitudinal electric and magnetic ﬁelds can-
cel (Ex = −∂t(Axcos(kx − ωt)) − ∂x(V cos(kx − ωt)) = 0
and Bx = (∇ × A)x = 0 because V = cLAx), the last
equation shows that, under the Lorenz constraint, the
vector potential has a non-zero longitudinal component
which is a gradient. As pointed out by B. Leaf, the time-
like and longitudinal potential components constitute a
Lorentz-covariant null vector which is not amenable to
boson quantization as the transverse components [21]. So
from the point of view of the potentials from which the
ﬁelds derive, light is neither a transverse or a longitudinal
wave : it is a composite wave...

Once again, one can understand the longitudinal prop-
agation for light with the sound analogy. By Fourier
transformation of the continuity equation for the ﬂuid,
one obtains : δp/ρ0 = cSδux. One recalls that the propa-
gation of sound waves is vorticity-free (Bx = 0) and that
one gets the propagation equations by combination of
the continuity equation with the linearized Navier-Stokes
equation (Ex = 0) [8] : ∂tδu + ∇(δp/ρ0) = 0. The longi-

tudinal propagation for light is not in contradiction with
polarization experiments which do show that light can
not be a pure longitudinal wave but that the electric ﬁeld
is transverse despite the fact that the vector potential has
a longitudinal component...

The longitudinal propagation of the potentials is also
a feature of electromagnetic waves in a coaxial cable with
the diﬀerence that the longitudinal vector potential is not
a gradient in this case [7, 13]. The unconvinced reader
could argue that all the results regarding light can be de-
rived without any reference to the potentials. Formerly,
it is right but there is an implicit statement when we use
the full set of Maxwell equations to derive light propa-
gation that is we consider the velocity of light as ﬁnite.
That’s why we advocated in this paper that it is equiva-
lent to use the Lorenz gauge.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, one can understand that the gauges ex-
press electromagnetic continuity from a physical point
of view based on an analogy with hydrodynamics. From
this analogy, we concluded that the Lorenz gauge is more
fundamental, in general, than the Coulomb gauge which
is an approximation for the stationary case and for the
time-dependent case when one neglects the propagation
of electromagnetic waves and more generally relativistic
phenomena within the magnetic limit. From the pedagog-
ical point of view, the analogy facilitates the use and un-
derstanding of the vectorial operators and allows to ﬁnd
solutions of electromagnetic problem much more readily
in terms of hydrodynamics equivalent [9].

The author is fully aware that the conclusions of this
paper are controversial as they defy old-established opin-
ions about the non-physical character of the potentials as
well as the so-called gauge conditions. Anyway, it is the
author’s belief that Electromagnetism cannot continue to
be transmit to young generations without understanding
the fundamentals of this discipline and in particular of
the potentials which are the primary quantity in rela-
tivity and quantum ﬁeld theory. Let us remind James
Clerk Maxwell’s own words : [the vector potential] is the
mathematical quantity which can be considered as the
fundamental quantity of the electromagnetic theory ([4],
Vol.2, p. 187). It is funny to notice that Maxwell used
also the following expressions : electrotonic state, elec-
trokinetic momentum or electromagnetic momentum to
designate the vector potential...

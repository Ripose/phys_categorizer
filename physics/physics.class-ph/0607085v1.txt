The Mihelson Sivashinsky equation, whih models the non linear dynamis of premixed

(cid:29)ames, has been reently extended to desribe oblique (cid:29)ames. This approah was extremely

suessful to desribe the behavior on one side of the (cid:29)ame, but some qualitative e(cid:27)ets

involving the interation of both sides of the front were left unexplained. We use here a

potential (cid:29)ow model, (cid:28)rst introdued by Frankel, to study numerially this on(cid:28)guration.

Furthermore, this approah allows us to provide a physial explanation of the phenomena

ouring in this geometry by means of an eletrostati analogy.

Introdution

The Mihelson Sivashinsky equation [1℄ forms the basis of non linear desriptions of laminar pre-

mixed (cid:29)ames. While originally developed for the ase of plane on average (cid:29)ames, variants of this

equation have also been applied to spherial expanding (cid:29)ames [2℄ [3℄. However, an extension of

this equation valid for oblique (cid:29)ames has been obtained only reently by Joulin in [4℄ by adding a

onvetive term to the original equation , whih mimis the transverse veloity appearing as soon

as the (cid:29)ame is maintained oblique ompared to the diretion of propagation. The motivation of

this work an be found in the experimental setup of Tru(cid:27)aut and Searby [5℄, whih the authors

have alled an inverted V (cid:29)ame. Atually this on(cid:28)guration is a sort of 2D Bunsen burner laminar

(cid:29)ame, perturbed on one side by an applied eletri (cid:28)eld. A omparison of the model equation

with the experiment has been remarkably suessful, even from a quantitative point of view, and

desribes the development and saturation of wrinkles ampli(cid:28)ed by the Darrieus-Landau instability.

However, this equation is limited to one side of the front. Searby and Tru(cid:27)aut have been able

to exhibit an e(cid:27)et not desribed by the lagrangian Mihelson Sivashinsky equation: when the

(cid:29)ame is exited on one side, relatively small ells develop on this fae of the (cid:29)ame but an overall

urvature of the (cid:29)ame at large sale ours.

This e(cid:27)et an only be explained by a model taking into aount both sides of the (cid:29)ame. It

turns out that suh a model already exists in the form of an equation derived by Frankel [6℄. We

shall desribe this model in more detail in setion 2, but for the moment let us just say that the

model assumes a potential (cid:29)ow both ahead and behind the (cid:29)ame, and onsists of a boundary

integral equation (the boundary is the (cid:29)ame front, seen as a disontinuity) involving eletrostati

potentials. Some numerial simulations of this equation an be found in the literature [7℄ [8℄ [9℄

[10℄ in the ase of expanding (cid:29)ames, but it has not been used for the moment in other geometries.

We use here a slightly modi(cid:28)ed version of this equation to study the 2D Bunsen (cid:29)ame ase. With

this method, all the phenomena observed experimentally are reovered and it is possible to use an

2

eletrostati analogy in order to get a physial understanding of this problem.

In setion 2 we present the Frankel equation in a form suitable to the present geometry and

we take the opportunity to show that this equation naturally leads to a qualitative interpretation

of the Darrieus Landau instability. In setion 3 we present the results obtained in the 2D Bunsen

(cid:29)ame on(cid:28)guration for various values of the parameters. Finally setion 4 ontains a onlusion.

2 Model

Let us (cid:28)rst introdue some notations. We use two di(cid:27)erent (cid:29)ame veloities, the (cid:29)ame veloity

relative to premixed gases ul and the (cid:29)ame veloity relative to burned gases ub . Without gas

expansion aused by the exothermi reations, these two di(cid:27)erent veloities would have the same

value. However typially the density in burned gases is (cid:28)ve to eight times lower than the density of

fresh gases, whih is the main ause of the Darrieus-Landau instability of premixed (cid:29)ames. If we

de(cid:28)ne ρu the density of fresh gases, ρb the density of burnt gases, γ = ρu−ρb

ρu a parameter measuring

gas expansion (γ = 0 without exothermi reations), then ub = ul

1−γ beause of mass onservation.

In many artiles, the notion of (cid:29)ame veloity relative to burned gases is never used, however in

the original Frankel paper, what is alled (cid:29)ame veloity is atually ub . We obtain below a Frankel

equation relative to fresh gases, and this form of the equation will be simulated in the following

setion. The derivation losely parallels the original one, exept for the (cid:29)ame veloity used and

for the geometry . A sketh of the on(cid:28)guration an be found in Figure 1, the unburnt gases

are injeted at the veloity U . The (cid:29)ame has a shape typial of a Bunsen burner and propagates

normally at a veloity ul in the diretion of unburnt gases. We also onsider that U is onstant in

spae and time and that the (cid:29)ame is attahed at two onstant position points.

The idea behind the Frankel equation is the following: the Mihelson Sivashinsky equation is

obtained as a development with γ as an expansion parameter.

It has been shown in [11℄ that

3

at the lowest order in γ, the equation obtained by negleting vortiity redues to the Mihelson

Sivashinsky equation. So let us neglet vortiity everywhere, inluding in the burnt gases, we an

de(cid:28)ne a veloity potential (wu and wb in the fresh and burnt gases), whih is solution of the 2D

Laplae equation:

On the (cid:29)ame, whih is a disontinuity in this formulation, the veloity potential has to satisfy

This equation gives the value of the normal veloity V on the front as a sum of several terms,

the laminar (cid:29)ame veloity with urvature orretions, the veloity of the inoming veloity (cid:28)eld

and an indued veloity (cid:28)eld (all the terms where γ appears) whih ontains an integral over the

whole shape (indiated by the subsript S in the integral ). This integral is a sum of eletrostati

potentials.

Let us reall that, as is well-known, the formula for the indued veloity (cid:28)eld at a position not

loated on the front is given by a di(cid:27)erent formula, whih we shall use to reonstrut the veloity

everywhere one the shape is known.

fresh gases with a veloity equal to ul , then the (cid:29)ame does not advane and the veloity in the

burnt gases is ub (left of Figure 2). As explained before we an add any potential veloity (cid:28)eld

whih does not generate a jump of veloity aross the (cid:29)ame (whih is already desribed by Vinduced )

so as to satisfy boudary onditions. In partiular we an add a onstant veloity (cid:28)eld, whih would

show that if the veloity (cid:28)eld in fresh gases is zero, the (cid:29)ame propagates at ul , if the veloity

(cid:28)eld in the burnt gases is zero, the apparent (cid:29)ame propagation veloity is ub . However equation

(1) orresponds to the symmetrial situation depited in the middle of Figure 2: the veloity (cid:28)eld

in the burnt and fresh gases has the same value (in the opposite diretion)

2

γ

1−γ (the

onstant value that appears in equation (1)) and the (cid:29)ame propagates at the apparent veloity

. There is an analogy of this situation with a uniformly harged in(cid:28)nite plane in eletrostatis

(Figure 2, right), whih generates on both side an eletri (cid:28)eld of value

σ
2ε0 in the international

ub+ul
2

system of units.

One of the purposes of this paper is to show that this analogy enables us to have a physial

understanding of phenomena ourring in unstable premixed (cid:29)ames. Let us start in this setion

by showing that we an explain qualitatively the Darrieus-Landau instability. We onsider one

again an in(cid:28)nite plane (cid:29)ame. The indued veloity

just above the (cid:29)ame is simply obtained by

integration over the whole front (left of Figure 3). Just on the front , the integral term in equation

ub−ul
2

ub−ul
2

(1) vanishes beause of symmetry reasons so that this term

has to be added expliitely in

(1). Let us onsider now a wrinkled (cid:29)ame (right of Figure 3). The indued veloity very lose to

the (cid:29)ame is obtained as before by integration over the whole front. However now we an see in

the (cid:28)gure (point A) that a part of the integration produes a veloity in the diretion opposite

to the previous indued veloity (cid:28)eld, whih tends to amplify the existing wrinkle. A similar

reasoning ould be performed at point B, showing also an ampli(cid:28)ation. Furthermore, it is easily

seen that smaller wavelengths lead to a higher instability, a known property of the Darrieus Landau

instability when urvature e(cid:27)ets are negleted. In onlusion of this paragraph, we an see that

6

the potential approximation leads to a physial explanation of the instability, whih would be muh

more di(cid:30)ult to ahieve for the omplete problem.

Before presenting the results, we an note that an approah equivalent to the Frankel equation

was used in [12℄ [13℄ [14℄ [15℄; The idea leading to this equation was slightly di(cid:27)erent. In the Frankel

ase the idea was to generalize the Mihelson Sivashinsky equation whih had a lot of suess for

plane on average (cid:29)ames. Pindera and Talbot wanted to provide a omplete numerial solution of

the (cid:29)ame problem when the (cid:29)ame is seen as a disontinuity. When barolinity is negleted we

obtain exatly the Frankel equation problem, and it ould be supplemented by resolutions with

vortex methods in order to have a rigorous desription of the veloity (cid:28)eld (with reation of vortiity

in the burnt gases). But this resolution is not very easy (i.e. not easier than a diret numerial

resolution of the problem). In this artile, in the spirit of the Mihelson-Sivashinsky equation, and

as in Ashurst's work (see for instane [9℄), we keep the potential approximation for the 2D Bunsen

(cid:29)ame ase desribed in the introdution, and show that this desription is qualitatively orret.

3 Results

In the Tru(cid:27)aut-Searby on(cid:28)guration that we try to model here, the 2D (cid:29)ame is perturbed on one

side, lose to the base of the (cid:29)ame, by an eletrostati apparatus. As a result, 2D wrinkles are

reated, with a wavelength depending on the frequeny of the applied eletri (cid:28)eld, and propagate

along the (cid:29)ame beause of the tangential veloity. During their trip from the base to the tip

of the (cid:29)ame, the perturbations are ampli(cid:28)ed by the Darrieus-Landau instability. A photograph

of an experiment is given in Figure 4. The displaement of the ells during the exposure time

an be seen, and gives an idea of the dynamis of the (cid:29)ame. A suessful desription of the

phenomena desribed above has been given by a Lagrangian Mihelson-Sivashinsky equation in

[4℄. However this approah is inherently limited to one side of the (cid:29)ame, and annot desribe

7

phenomena involving interation of both sides, suh as the large sale urvature of the (cid:29)ame that

an be observed in Figure 4.

We use here the Frankel equation [1℄ to study this problem. Let us (cid:28)rst verify that we are

able to reover the experimental results with this model. We exite the (cid:29)ame by applying a

veloity vx = a cos(ωt) at the fourth point starting from the bottom of the (cid:29)ame, x is the diretion

perpendiular to the injetion veloity. As the (cid:29)ame front is desribed by a hain of markers

(tehnial details on the numerial method an be found in [10℄) the position of this point is not

stritly onstant, but the perturbations being small at this loation, we have found that this type

of foring is satisfatory i.e. it generates a well de(cid:28)ned wavelength related to the frequeny and the

tangential veloity. Figure 5 is obtained by a numerial simulation for parameters U = 10 L = 4

ε = 0.2 a = 1 γ = 0.8 ω = 50 (L is the distane at the base of the (cid:29)ame, in all the alulations

ul = 1) . The number of markers used in the simulation is not onstant in time but is typially

around 900. On this (cid:28)gure are plotted both the shape of the front and the indued veloity (cid:28)eld

(atually Vinduced + Vboundary , see equation (2)). Arrows very lose to the front are not drawn in

this (cid:28)gure, as the formula for the indued veloity (cid:28)eld annot be applied when the distane from

the front is of the order of the distane between suessive markers. Naturally the analogy with

Figure 4 is striking: both the wrinkle ampli(cid:28)ation and subsequent saturation by non linear e(cid:27)ets

are observed, but also the large sale urvature (i.e. as we get loser to the tip, the side opposite to

the foring gets more and more de(cid:29)eted). This progressive deviation of the right side of the (cid:29)ame

is a onsequene of the indued veloity (cid:28)eld, whih has a omponent towards the right when one

approahes the tip, as an be seen in Figure 5.

This large sale deviation was observed by Tru(cid:27)aut and Searby, and for the moment the Frankel

equation sueeds in produing this e(cid:27)et. But a qualitative interpretation an also be obtained.

We have seen that it an be onsidered that the indued veloity is aused by a uniformly positively

harged front (the eletrostati analogy). As the wrinkle develops when we get loser to the tip,

8

the veloity has a sinusoidal omponent with the wrinkle wavelength in the diretion parallel to

the front, and, as a solution of a Laplae equation, this omponent deays exponentially in the

perpendiular diretion. So, the perturbation with the wrinkle wavelength will be small on the

side opposite to the foring. Su(cid:30)iently far, the perturbed side an just be onsidered as a straight

unperturbed line, but with a harge higher than before (a onsequene of the Gauss theorem: the

harge inside a small retangle is higher beause of the wrinkle). So the situation is lose to the

sketh of Figure 6. At the base of the (cid:29)ame, the harge is the same for both sides of the (cid:29)ame. As

a result the veloities indued by both sides of the (cid:29)ame have the same absolute value, but are in

the opposite diretion if we onsider for simpliity both sides parallel. The total indued veloity

(cid:28)eld nearly anels in the fresh gases, and is high in the burnt gases. On the ontrary, in a zone

with well-developed wrinkles, the harge is higher on the wrinkled side beause of the previous

argument, and generates a veloity with a higher absolute value. The total indued veloity (cid:28)eld

is thus direted towards the right, and tends to ause a deviation of both sides of the (cid:29)ame (see

Figure 5). There is also the fat that the front annot be onsidered in(cid:28)nite lose to the tip, whih

generates a veloity upward beause there is no ompensation of the upward veloity (cid:28)eld reated

by the harges below (on the other hand, at the base of the (cid:29)ame the veloity is very small beause

the downward Vinduced is ompensated by Vboundary whih is a veloity (cid:28)eld reated by the image

of the (cid:29)ame: see Figure 1).

The potential (cid:29)ow model is thus in very good qualitative agreement with the experiments of

Searby and Tru(cid:27)aut. However, it does not seem possible to obtain the same quantitative agreement

for the development of a wrinkle on one side, as in the lagrangian Mihelson Sivashinsky ase [4℄.

The reason an be understood in the following way : atually the results of [4℄ are obtained by a

Mihelson Sivashinsky equation with modi(cid:28)ed oe(cid:30)ients. The dispersion relation is (cid:28)tted in order

to be in agreement with the experimental results, then there is also a modi(cid:28)ation (ompatible

with an expansion in γ ) of the oe(cid:30)ient of the non linear term. With these modi(cid:28)ations the

9

development of perturbations along the front an be desribed quantitatively. However in our ase

a modi(cid:28)ation of the oe(cid:30)ients to (cid:28)t the dispersion relation would have also an e(cid:27)et on the other

side on the front. It seems unlikely that the same set of oe(cid:30)ients an desribe preisely both the

dispersion relation and the e(cid:27)et of one side on the other, although some kind of ompromise an

perhaps be found.

So we will limit ourselves in this paper to qualitative results obtained by the Frankel equation.

A positive point of this model is that we an vary easily the physial parameters, ontrary to

experiments. Of ourse hanging the width at the base of the (cid:29)ame involves a whole new burner,

but it is also di(cid:30)ult experimentally to inrease the injetion veloity, beause the (cid:29)ame has to be

anhored on the rod where the eletri (cid:28)eld is applied.

When perturbations of the 2D Bunsen (cid:29)ame do exist on both sides of the front, the question

arises of knowing the type of modes that will develop, sinuous or various. It is possible to impose

one of this mode by applying an eletri (cid:28)eld on both sides, with a well-de(cid:28)ned phase relationship,

but we prefer here to study what will happen naturally. We apply now a white noise at the base

of the (cid:29)ame, at the same loation as before, but on both sides. A typial front shape, for a small

width L = 1 and a large injetion veloity U = 40 is shown in Figure 7. The other parameters are

ε = 0.2 and γ = 0.8, the amplitude of the white noise being a = 5, vx = a(random − 0.5) where

random is a random number (uniform distribution between 0 and 1), always imposed on the fourth

point from the base of the (cid:29)ame .The number of points used in the simulation is typially 7000.

The main onlusion of di(cid:27)erent alulations, whih an be seen on the Figure, is the following: in

a (cid:28)rst stage, perturbations develop on both sides in an independent way, neither the sinuous nor

the various mode are favored. However, for a su(cid:30)ient length of the (cid:29)ame, lose to the tip, the

sinuous mode is the dominant one. The sinuous zone orresponds to a distane between both sides

of the order of the wavelength, whih is natural for a potential model. Atually, when this distane

is omparable to the wavelength, the perturbations have the following hoie: be damped beause

they do not have a su(cid:30)ient distane to develop, or amplify as before but in a sinuous mode. A

similar sinuous mode has been obtained in [16℄ for twin (cid:29)ames in stagnation point (cid:29)ows.

Another interesting problem is the wavelength itself. For a planar on average (cid:29)ame without

gravity, perturbations with the most ampli(cid:28)ed wavelength emerge from a (cid:29)at front, then non linear

e(cid:27)ets ome into play, ells merge and in the end only one ell remains. This e(cid:27)et is generally not

observed in oblique (cid:29)ames, simply beause the available length is too short, and the wrinkles reah

the tip before merging. In order to observe the merging (in a lagrangian way) we onsider a very

large (cid:29)ame: U = 10 L = 20 ε = 0.2 γ = 0.8. These onditions orrespond either to a very large

(cid:29)ame at atmospheri pressure or to a (cid:29)ame at high pressure. We start the simulation from a (cid:29)ame

whih has been submitted for some time to a white noise everywhere, not only at the base, as in

Figure 7. This front an be seen in Figure 8 whih will be used as an initial ondition. The small

ells of this (cid:29)ame evolve in the Figures 9 to 11 without any noise. The merging of the ells, similar

to the one observed in planar on average (cid:29)ame, appears, but ours here in a lagrangian way, as

the ells are onveted towards the tip. The reader an (cid:28)nd a similar behavior obtained reently

with the lagrangian Mihelson Sivashinsky equation in [17℄ (see also the orresponding animation

whih an be found on the Combustion Theory and Modelling web site). The e(cid:27)et seen previously

exists also here, sinuous modes dominate at the tip. However as the perturbations develop, the

overall surfae being more or less onstant, the height of the (cid:29)ame beomes smaller, as seen in

Figure 11. The same e(cid:27)et is observed in turbulent (cid:29)ows, and as the available length on eah side

of the mean (cid:29)ame is smaller, the merging of ells beomes more di(cid:30)ult. An example of turbulent

(cid:29)ames obtained in this on(cid:28)guration, whih are relatively similar to the solutions obtained here in

the presene of noise, an be found in [18℄.

After this solution, we have not seen a ontinuation of the merging proess, on the ontrary

new ells appear on the front while some ells merge. Also we have seen no sign that the (cid:29)ame

will ultimately reover its unperturbed shape. The two last observations are related to the level of

11

numerial noise present in the simulation, for instane insertion and deletion of markers. Atually

we have found in another oblique on(cid:28)guration (V (cid:29)ame with initial perturbations) and for similar

sizes, that it is possible to reover a more or less stationary (cid:29)ame by using twie as many markers

in the simulation. In [4℄, it has been suggested that for a su(cid:30)ient injetion veloity (i.e. in normal

situations), the instability of the (cid:29)ame is onvetive, whih seems to be the ase with the potential

model used here. However, just as in the expanding (cid:29)ame ase, it appears that for large sizes, the

(cid:29)ame is extremely sensitive to any external noise. Very small injetion veloities, orresponding to

an absolute instability, ould atually lead to (cid:29)ashbak. We have seen some indiations that this

phenomenon atually ours, but it was not possible to desribe orretly the evolution with the

urrent algorithm after the (cid:29)ame enters the tube.

4 Conlusion

In this artile, we have studied the 2D Bunsen (cid:29)ame on(cid:28)guration proposed by Tru(cid:27)aut and

Searby by means of a model equation whih onsiders the (cid:29)ow as potential both ahead and behind

the (cid:29)ame. It has been shown that this approximation gives a good qualitative desription of the

phenomena observed. On the other hand, it is probably di(cid:30)ult to obtain a omplete quantitative

agreement with experiments with this model, ontrary to modi(cid:28)ed versions of the Mihelson-

Sivashinsky equation, whih do not desribe the repulsion e(cid:27)et of the perturbed side of the front.

We expet however that other oblique (cid:29)ame geometries an be studied with this approah, suh as

V (cid:29)ames or 3D premixed Bunsen burner (cid:29)ames. However the 3D ase is very di(cid:30)ult tehnially,

beause the treatment of reonnetions implemented here in 2D is hallenging in 3D (it is ironi

that these reonnetions ourring lose to the tip play a minor role in the physis, exept for

symmetrial forings, but are the main numerial di(cid:30)ulty of the problem). Another natural

extension of this work would be to onsider a (cid:29)ame in a turbulent (cid:29)ow, in order to get an estimate

12

of the relative importane of turbulene and of the Darrieus-Landau instability. The author has

already done some work with turbulene and hydrodynami instability for expanding (cid:29)ames, but

this ould now be extended to oblique (cid:29)ames. We have also found in this artile that the qualitative

behavior an be di(cid:27)erent for (cid:29)ames in di(cid:27)erent geometries. This e(cid:27)et is known in laminar (cid:29)ame

on(cid:28)gurations, but ertainly deserves attention also in the turbulent ase.

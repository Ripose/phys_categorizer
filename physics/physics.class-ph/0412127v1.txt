ABSTRACT

A scalar ﬁeld method to obtain transverse solutions
of the vector Laplace and Helmholtz equations in
spherical coordinates for boundary-value problems
with azimuthal symmetry is described. Neither
scalar nor vector potentials are used.
Solutions
are obtained by use of separation of variables
instead of dyadic Green’s functions expanded in
terms of vector spherical harmonics. Applications
to the calculations of magnetic ﬁelds from steady
and oscillating localized current distributions are
presented.

Keywords: Vector Laplace and Helmholtz Equa-
Spherical Coordinates, Electromagnetic
tions,
Fields.

INTRODUCTION

In many physical applications the vector Laplace
equation ∇2 ~F = ~0 or the vector Helmholtz equation
∇2 ~F + k2 ~F = ~0 for spherical coordinates and
It is the
boundary conditions has to be solved.
case for instance with the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds wherever there is no free charge and current
distributions. In spherical coordinates, however, the
Laplacian of the vector ∇2 ~F leads to a set of three
simultaneous equations, each equation involving all
three components Fr, Fθ, Fϕ [1]. This complication
is well known and general techniques for solving
these equations have been developed, based on a
dyadic Green’s function involving vector spherical
harmonics which transforms the boundary condi-
tions and source densities into the vector solution [2].

In a number of cases the vector ﬁeld must also have
zero divergence: ~∇ · ~F = 0. This is so for example
for the magnetic ﬁeld and in general for transverse
vector ﬁelds. With this transverse condition it can
be shown that the above vector equations can be
separated into an equation for Fr alone. However,
this is not true for the other two scalar components
of the vector ﬁeld. Nevertheless,
it is possible
to obtain a straightforward solution for Fθ in a
problem with azimuthal symmetry; here we are not
concerned about those symmetry cases where only

Fϕ is nonzero because a scalar technique of sepa-
ration of variables is already known to obtain the
solution [3]. Several problems of physical interest
can then be treated with the standard mathematical
methods used to solving scalar ﬁeld equations, so
avoiding the dyadic method [4].

The purpose of this paper is to report the use of
the technique to compute the solution to instruc-
tive examples taken from the electromagnetic theory,
though there are diﬀerent other places where vector
ﬁelds show up. Speciﬁcally, we work out magnetic
ﬁeld solutions from localized current distributions.
The main methods which may be used for solving
boundary-value problems in magnetism involve the
vector potential and the scalar potential [5]. The
new technique we discuss here deals with the mag-
netic ﬁeld itself, without reference to any kind of
potential. The approach can also be used to calcu-
late electric ﬁelds from localized charge distributions
since the equations to be solved are the same.

2. TRANSVERSE SOLUTIONS OF THE
VECTOR LAPLACE EQUATION

In order to calculate the components of the vector
∇2 ~F along the axes of the spherical system of coor-
dinates, the following identity must be used:

∇2 ~F = −~∇ × (~∇ × ~F ) + ~∇(~∇ · ~F ).

(1)

By combining with the transverse condition ~∇· ~F = 0
and requiring azimuthal symmetry, we ﬁnd the equa-
tion

(∇2 ~F )r =

1
r2

∂2
∂r2 (r2Fr) +

1
r2 sin θ

∂
∂θ

(sin θ

∂Fr

)

for the radial component of the vector Laplace equa-
tion ∇2 ~F = ~0. To compute Fθ is convenient to use
the transverse condition:

~∇ · ~F =

(r2Fr) +

1
r sin θ

∂

(sin θ Fθ)

= 0

= 0,

(2)

(3)

where azimuthal symmetry has been demanded.

Equation (2) can be solved by the usual technique of
separation of variables. If a product form for Fr is
assumed, then it can be written

Fr(r, θ) =

u(r)
r2 P (θ).

(4)

The following separate equations for u(r) and P (θ)
are obtained:

(6)

where n(n + 1) is the real separation constant. The
solution of Eq. (5) is

u(r) = a rn+1 +

b
rn .

(7)

Equation (6) is the Legendre equation of order n and
the only solution which is single valued, ﬁnite and
continuous over the whole interval corresponds to the
Legendre polynomial Pn(cos θ), n being a positive
integer. Thus the general solution for Fr is

Fr(r, θ) =

Pn(cos θ).

where vn(r) are functions to be determined. By re-

for n ≥ 1 with ao = 0. The coeﬃcients an and bn
are to be determined from the boundary conditions.

On the other hand, we note that the solution ob-
tained from Eqs. (8), (9) and (10) satisﬁes the angu-
lar component of the Laplace equation for transverse
vector ﬁelds and azimuthal symmetry:

(∇2 ~F )θ =

1
r

∂2
∂r2 (rFθ) −

∂2Fr
∂r∂θ

= 0,

(11)

as expected by consistency. This happens because
Eqs. (2) and (3) imply

∂
∂r

(rFθ) −

= 0,

∂Fr
∂θ

(12)

which leads to Eq. (11); clearly, the solutions given
in Eqs. (8), (9) and (10) satisfy Eq. (12).

In the case of the magnetic ﬁeld, we recall that the
boundary conditions at a boundary separating two
regions are

ˆn · ( ~B1 − ~B2) = 0,

ˆn × ( ~H1 − ~H2) = ~JS,

(13)

where ~JS is the surface current density and the nor-
mal unit vector ˆn is drawn from the second region
into the ﬁrst one. For a linear medium the consti-
tutive relation ~B = µ ~H holds, µ being the constant
magnetic permeability. To see how the technique
works out, we consider the simple, common textbook
example of the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the rota-
tion of a sphere of radius a, uniformly charged with a
charge Q, with constant angular velocity ω, which is
usually solved with the vector potential method [2,5].
The surface current density at r = a is

~JS(a, θ, ϕ) =

sin θ ˆϕ,

(14)

ωQ
4πa

where the z axis has been chosen along the rotation
axis. The problem reduces to using the series solu-
tions (8), (9) and (10) of the Laplace equation in the
regions r > a and r < a to conform to the require-
ment that the magnetic ﬁeld must be ﬁnite at the
origin, vanish at inﬁnity and satisfy the boundary
conditions of Eq. (13) at r = a. Using ~B = µ◦ ~H,
where µ◦ is the vacuum magnetic permeability, the
resulting magnetic ﬁeld can be seen to be

~H(r, θ) =

This solution describes a uniform magnetic ﬁeld

Another example is that of the magnetic ﬁeld from
a circular current loop of radius a lying in the
x-y plane with its center at the origin and carrying
a current I. In this case the surface current density
at r = a is

~JS(a, θ, ϕ) =

δ(cos θ) ˆϕ.

The constants cn and dn are computed from the
requirement that the vector ﬁeld has to satisfy the
boundary conditions of the given problem.

On the other hand, we observe that the solution
given in Eqs. (22), (23) and (24) satisﬁes the angular
component of the Helmholtz equation for transverse
vector ﬁelds and azimuthal symmetry:

In the case of the Helmholtz equation for transversal
vector ﬁelds the radial equation becomes

Equation (3) still applies for problems possessing
azimuthal symmetry; it is used to obtain Fθ from Fr.

Next, by putting

Fr(r, θ) =

P (θ),

(20)

we can separate Eq. (19) into two equations:

for j(r) and Eq. (6) for P (θ), where n(n + 1) is the
separation constant. Equation (21) is the spherical
Bessel equation of order n in the variable kr. There-
fore, the general solution for Fr is

= 0,

(25)

as expected, where Eq. (21) must be used.

An illustration is provided by the problem of the
radiation from a vibrating current loop lying in the

4. CONCLUSION

The expressions for the components of ∇2 ~F in
spherical coordinates are really messy, but they
appear for instance in Laplace and Helmholtz equa-
tions for vector ﬁelds, such as the electromagnetic
ﬁelds. We have presented a fairly simple technique
of separation of variables to compute transverse
solutions with ~∇ · ~F = 0 of these vector equations
applied to boundary-value problems with azimuthal
symmetry, so avoiding the general, more extensive
method in which dyadic Green’s functions and
series expansions in vector spherical harmonics

are introduced.
It involves scalar solutions for
the spherical components of ~F which resemble the
ones obtained for the scalar Laplace and Helmholtz
equations. No scalar or vector potentials are used.
Illustrations were provided by problems concerned
with the magnetic ﬁeld from steady and oscillating
localized currents. We ﬁnally remark that the
method can also be extended to solving boundary-
value problems in cylindrical coordinates possessing
azimuthal symmetry, although in this case we deal
with a separated equation for each scalar component
of the vector ﬁeld [1], so that the problem of solving
the vector Laplace or Helmholtz equation reduces
to that of solving the corresponding scalar equation.

ELECTRODYNAMIC FORCES IN ELASTIC MATTER

S. ANTOCI AND L. MIHICH

Abstract. A macroscopic theory for the dynamics of elastic, isotropic
matter in presence of electromagnetic ﬁelds is proposed here. We avail
of Gordon’s general relativistic derivation of Abraham’s electromagnetic
energy tensor as starting point. The necessary description of the elas-
tic and of the inertial behaviour of matter is provided through a four-
dimensional generalisation of Hooke’s law, made possible by the intro-
duction of a four-dimensional “displacement” vector. As intimated by
Nordstr¨om, the physical origin of electrostriction and of magnetostric-
tion is attributed to the change in the constitutive equation of elec-
tromagnetism caused by the deformation of matter. The part of the
electromagnetic Lagrangian that depends on that deformation is given
explicitly for the case of an isotropic medium and the resulting expres-
sion of the electrostrictive force is derived, thus showing how more real-
istic equations of motion for matter subjected to electromagnetic ﬁelds
can be constructed.

1. Introduction

According to a widespread belief cultivated by present-day physicists, gen-
eral relativity exerts its sovereign power in the heavens, where it supposedly
rules tremendous astrophysical processes and awesome cosmological scenar-
ios, but it has essentially nothing to say about more down to earth issues
like the physics of ordinary matter, as it shows up in terrestrial laboratories.
This way of thinking does not conform to the hopes expressed by Bernhard
Riemann in his celebrated Habilitationsschrift [1]. While commenting upon
the possible applications to the physical space of his new geometrical ideas,
he wrote:

Die Fragen ¨uber das Unmeßbargroße sind f¨ur die Natur-
erkl¨arung m¨usige Fragen. Anders verh¨alt es sich aber mit
den Fragen ¨uber das Unmeßbarkleine 1.

The latter is presently supposed to be the exclusive hunting ground for quan-
tum physics, whose workings occur at their best in the ﬂat space of Newton.
The classical ﬁeld theories, in particular classical electromagnetism, are be-
lieved to have accomplished their midwife task a long time ago. Although

they are still revered, since they act as cornerstones for the applied sci-
ences, and also provide the very foundation on which quantum mechanics
and quantum ﬁeld theory do stand, no fundamental insights are generally
expected from their further frequentation. This mind habit cannot subsist
without a strenuous act of faith in the ﬁnal nature of the present-day reduc-
tionist programme: since for all practical purposes we have eventually at-
tained the right microscopic laws, getting from there the right macroscopic
physics should be just a matter of deduction by calculation (for the ever
growing army of computer addicts, a sheer problem of computing power).
Given time and endurance, we should be able to account for all the observed
phenomena just by starting from our very simple microscopic laws!

It is not here the place for deciding how much this bold faith in the capa-
bilities of today’s reductionist approach be strenghtened by its undeniable
successes, and how much it depend on having tackled just the sort of prob-
lems that are most suited to such a method. However, when confronted
with the end results of many reductionist eﬀorts, the obdurate classicist
cannot help frowning in puzzlement. While he expects to meet with macro-
scopic laws derived from the underlying microscopic postulates by a pure
exercise of logic, the everyday’s practice confronts him with a much less
palatable food. At best he is presented with rather particular examples
usually worked out from the sacred principles through the surreptitious ad-
dition of a host of subsidiary assumptions. In the worst cases he is forced to
contemplate and believe sequels of colourful plots and diagrams, generated
by some computing device in some arcane way that he is simply impotent at
producing again. In the intention of their proponents, both the “analytic”
instances and their numerical surrogates should provide typical examples of
some supposedly general behaviour, really stemming from the basic tenets
of the theory, and in many a case this lucky occurrence may well have oc-
curred, since “God watches over applied mathematicians” [2]. Nevertheless,
the longing of the classicist for macroscopic laws of clear conceptual ancestry
that do encompass in surveyable form a large class of phenomena remains
sadly disattended. He is led to remind of the pre-quantum era, when both
the reductionist approaches and the macroscopic ones were believed to be
equally important tools for the advancement of physical knowledge 2, and
to wonder whether relegating the macroscopic ﬁeld approach to the “phe-
nomenological” dustbin was really a wise move. Before being removed from
center stage by more modern approaches, the macroscopic ﬁeld theory lived
long enough for developing, in the hands of great natural philosophers and
mathematicians, theoretical tools of a very wide scope that, if still remem-
bered and cultivated, would be recognized to be very useful today.

2It is remarkable how the otherwise daring Minkowski kept a cautious attitude with
respect to Lorentz’ atomistic theory of electricity both in his fundamental paper [3] of
1908 and also in his “Nachlass” notes [4], posthumously edited and published by Max
Born.

2. Electrodynamic forces in material media

One of the clearest instances in which recourse to macroscopic ﬁeld theory
proves to be a quite helpful research tool occurs when one tries to describe
the electromagnetic forces in material media. Since the time of Lorentz
this has been a very challenging task; reductionist approaches starting from
classical mechanics and from vacuum electrodynamics, for reasons clearly
spelled out e. g. by Ott [5], end up in a disappointing gamut of possibilities
also when the program of a rigorous special relativistic derivation is tena-
ciously adhered to [6], [7]. To our knowledge, a derivation of the macroscopic
forces exerted by the electromagnetic ﬁeld on a material medium performed
by availing of quantum electrodynamics as the underlying microscopic the-
ory, that should be de rigueur in the reductionist programme, has never
been undertaken 3.

Happily enough, the theoretical advance in the methods for producing the
stress energy momentum tensor of non gravitational ﬁelds occurred with the
onset of general relativity theory [11], [12] have allowed W. Gordon to ﬁnd,
through a clever reduction to the vacuum case of the latter theory [13],
a clear-cut argument for determining the electromagnetic forces in matter
that is homogeneous and isotropic in its local rest frame. We shall recall
Gordon’s result in the next Section, since extending his outcome to the case
of an elastic medium is just the scope of the present paper.

3. Gordon’s reductio ad vacuum of the constitutive equation of

electromagnetism

We adopt hereafter Gordon’s conventions [13] and assume that the metric

tensor gik can be locally brought to the diagonal form

(3.1)

gik = ηik

diag(1, 1, 1,

1)

≡

−

at a given event through the appropriate transformation of coordinates.
According to the established convention [14] let the electric displacement
and the magnetic ﬁeld be represented by the antisymmetric, contravariant
tensor density Hik, while the electric ﬁeld and the magnetic induction are
accounted for by the skew, covariant tensor Fik. With these geometrical
objects we deﬁne the four-vectors:

(3.2)

Fi = Fikuk, Hi = Hikuk,
where ui is the four-velocity of matter. In general relativity a linear electro-
magnetic medium can be told to be homogeneous and isotropic in its rest
frame if its constitutive equations can be written as

(3.3)

µH ik = F ik + (ǫµ

1)(uiF k

ukF i),

−
3By availing once more of the midwife abilities of classical ﬁeld theory, the converse
has instead been attempted: some forms of “phenomenological” classical electrodynamics
in matter has been subjected to some quantisation process [8], [9], [10], thereby producing
diverse brands of “phenomenological” photons.

where the numbers ǫ and µ account for the dielectric constant and for the
magnetic permeability of the medium [13]. This equation provides the con-
stitutive relation in the standard form:

Hik =

valid for linear media [15]. Gordon observed that equation (3.3) can be

4. Gordon’s derivation of Abraham’s energy tensor

This result is the basis of Gordon’s argument: since, apart from the con-
stant factor
ǫ/µ, equation (3.10) is the constitutive equation for electro-
magnetism in a general relativistic vacuum whose metric be σik, the La-
grangian density that we shall use for deriving the laws of the ﬁeld is:

where si is the four-current density, while ϕi is the potential four-vector that
deﬁnes the electric ﬁeld and the magnetic induction:

We have adopted the convention of enclosing within round brackets the
indices that are either moved with σik and σik, or generated by performing
the Hamiltonian derivative with respect to the mentioned tensors. The
position (4.2) is equivalent to asking the satisfaction of the homogeneous set
of Maxwell’s equations

In our general relativistic framework, we can avail of the results found by
Hilbert and Klein [11], [12] for determining the energy tensor of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld. If the metric tensor of our pseudo-Riemannian space-time
were σik, Hilbert’s method would provide the electromagnetic energy tensor
by executing the Hamiltonian derivative of the Lagrangian density L with
respect to that metric:

which is just the general relativistic form of the energy tensor density pro-
posed by Minkowski in his fundamental work [3]. But gik, not σik, is the true
metric that accounts for the structure of space-time and, through Einstein’s
equations, deﬁnes its overall energy tensor. Therefore the partial contribu-
tion to that energy tensor coming from the electromagnetic ﬁeld must be
obtained by calculating the Hamiltonian derivative of L with respect to gik.
After some algebra [13] one easily gets the electromagnetic energy tensor:

(4.10)

and one eventually recognizes that Tik is the general relativistic extension
of Abraham’s tensor [16] for a medium that is homogeneous and isotropic
when looked at in its local rest frame. The four-force density exerted by the
electromagnetic ﬁeld on the medium shall be given by (minus) the covariant
divergence of that energy tensor density:

where the semicolon stands for the covariant diﬀerentiation done by using
the Christoﬀel symbols built with the metric gik. Abraham’s energy tensor
is an impressive theoretical outcome, that could hardly have been antici-
pated on the basis of heuristic arguments. Quite remarkably, the so called
Abraham’s force density, that stems from the four-divergence of that tensor,
has found experimental conﬁrmation in some delicate experiences performed
by G. B. Walker et al. [17], [18]. Despite this, Abraham’s rendering of the

electrodynamic forces is not realistic enough, for it does not cope with the
long known phenomena of electrostriction and of magnetostriction. We need
to ﬁnd its generalization, and we shall start from considering the case of lin-
ear elastic media, to which Hooke’s law applies. This task would be made
formally easier if one could avail of a relativistic reformulation of the linear
theory of elasticity; the next Section will achieve this goal through a four-
dimensional formulation of Hooke’s law [19] that happens to be rather well
suited to our scopes.

5. A four-dimensional formulation of Hooke’s law

By availing of Cartesian coordinates and of the three-dimensional tensor
formalism, that was just invented to cope with its far-reaching consequences,
Hooke’s law “ut tensio sic vis” [20] can be written as

(5.1)

Θλµ =

C λµρσ(ξρ,σ + ξσ,ρ),

1
2

where Θλµ is the three-dimensional tensor that deﬁnes the stresses arising
in matter due to its displacement, given by the three-vector ξρ, from a
supposedly relaxed condition, and C λµρσ is the constitutive tensor whose
build depends on the material features and on the symmetry properties of
It seems natural to wonder whether this venerable
the elastic medium.
formula can admit of not merely a redressing, but of a true generalization
to the four-dimensions of the general relativistic spacetime. From a formal
standpoint, the extension is obvious: one introduces a four-vector ﬁeld ξi,
that should represent a four-dimensional “displacement”, and builds the
“deformation” tensor

(5.2)

Sik =

(ξi;k + ξk;i).

1
2

A four-dimensional “stiﬀness” tensor density Ciklm is then introduced; it
will be symmetric in both the ﬁrst pair and the second pair of indices, since
it will be used for producing a “stress-momentum-energy” tensor density
Tik = CiklmSlm,

(5.3)

through the four-dimensional generalization of equation (5.1). It has been
found [19] that this generalization can be physically meaningful, since it al-
lows one to encompass both inertia and elasticity in a sort of four-dimensional
elasticity. Let us consider a coordinate system such that, at a given event,
equation (3.1) holds, while the Christoﬀel symbols are vanishing and the
components of the four-velocity of matter are:

(5.4)

u1 = u2 = u3 = 0, u4 = 1.

We imagine that in such a coordinate system we are able to measure, at
the chosen event, the three components of the (supposedly small) spatial
displacement of matter from its relaxed condition, and that we adopt these
three numbers as the values taken by ξρ in that coordinate system, while

ELECTRODYNAMIC FORCES IN ELASTIC MATTER

the reading of some clock ticking the proper time and travelling with the
medium will provide the value of the “temporal displacement” ξ4 in the
same coordinate system. By applying this procedure to all the events of the
manifold where matter is present and by reducing the collected data to a
common, arbitrary coordinate system, we can deﬁne the vector ﬁeld ξi(xk).
From such a ﬁeld we shall require that, when matter is not subjected to
ordinary strain and is looked at in a local rest frame belonging to the ones
deﬁned above, it will exhibit a “deformation tensor” Sik such that its only

The latter deﬁnition holds provided that

and this shall be one equation that the ﬁeld ξi must satisfy; in this way
the number of independent components of ξi will be reduced to three 4.
A four-dimensional “stiﬀness” tensor C iklm possibly endowed with physical
meaning can be built as follows. We assume that in a locally Minkowskian
rest frame the only nonvanishing components of C iklm are: C λνστ , with the
meaning of ordinary elastic moduli, and

C 4444 =

ρ,

−

where ρ measures the rest density of matter. But of course we need deﬁning
the four-dimensional “stiﬀness” tensor in an arbitrary co-ordinate system.
The task can be easily accomplished if the unstrained matter is isotropic
when looked at in a locally Minkowskian rest frame, and this is just the oc-
currence that we have already studied from the electromagnetic standpoint
in Sections 3 and 4. Let us deﬁne the auxiliary metric

(5.8)

γik = gik + uiuk;

then the part of C iklm accounting for the ordinary elasticity of the isotropic
medium can be written as [21]

(5.9)

C iklm

el. =

λγikγlm

µ(γilγkm + γimγkl),

−
where λ and µ are assumed to be constants. The part of C iklm that accounts
for the inertia of matter shall read instead

(5.10)

C iklm

−

4The fulﬁlment of equation (5.5) is only a necessary, not a suﬃcient condition for
the ﬁeld ξi
to take up the tentative meaning that was envisaged above. The physical
interpretation of the ﬁeld ξi can only be assessed a posteriori from the solutions of the
ﬁeld equations.

(5.12)

while, again thanks to equation (5.5), the inertial part of the energy tensor
proves to be eﬀectively so, since

T ik

in. Slm = ρuiuk.

The energy tensor deﬁned by summing the contributions (5.11) and (5.12)
encompasses both the inertial and the elastic energy tensor of an isotropic
medium; when the macroscopic electromagnetic ﬁeld is vanishing it should
represent the overall energy tensor, whose covariant divergence must vanish
according to Einstein’s equations [11], [12]:

(5.13)

T ik
;k = 0.
Imposing the latter condition allows one to write the equations of motion
for isotropic matter subjected to elastic strain [22]. We show this outcome
in the limiting case when the metric is everywhere ﬂat and the four-velocity
of matter is such that uρ can be dealt with as a ﬁrst order inﬁnitesimal
quantity, while u4 diﬀers from unity at most for a second order inﬁnitesimal
quantity. Also the spatial components ξρ of the displacement vector and
their derivatives are supposed to be inﬁnitesimal at ﬁrst order. An easy
calculation [19] then shows that equation (5.6) is satisﬁed to the required
ﬁrst order, and that equations (5.13) reduce to the three equations of motion:

(5.14)

ρξν

,4,4 = λξρ,ν

,ρ + µ(ξν,ρ + ξρ,ν),ρ,

and to the conservation equation

(5.15)

,k = 0,

i. e., to the required order, they come to coincide with the well known
equations of the classical theory of elasticity for an isotropic medium.

6. Electrostriction and magnetostriction in isotropic matter

Having provided that portion of the equations of motion of matter that
stems from the inertial and from the elastic part of the energy tensor, we can
go back to the other side of our problem: ﬁnding to what changes the elec-
trodynamic forces predicted in isotropic matter by Gordon’s theory must be
subjected in order to account for electrostriction and for magnetostriction.
Driven by a suggestion found in the quoted paper by Nordstr¨om [15], we at-
tribute the physical origin of the electrostrictive and of the magnetostrictive
forces to the changes that the constitutive relation (3.4) undergoes when
matter is strained in some way.
If one desires to represent explicitly the
eﬀect of a small spatial deformation on the constitutive relation of electro-
magnetism, one can replace (3.4) with a new equation, written in terms of
the new tensor density Yikpqmn, that can be chosen to be antisymmetric

ELECTRODYNAMIC FORCES IN ELASTIC MATTER

9

with respect to the ﬁrst pair and to the last pair of indices, symmetric with
respect to the second pair. This tensor density allows one to rewrite the
constitutive relation as follows:

(6.1)

Hik =

YikpqmnSpqFmn,

1
2

where Fik is deﬁned by (4.2) and Sik is given by (5.2). For the intended
application to isotropic matter it is convenient to split the equation writ-
ten above in two terms, one concerning the unstrained medium, that has
already been examined in Sections 3 and 4, and one dealing with the spatial
deformation proper. Due to equation (5.5) one ﬁnds

(6.2)

upuq(ξp;q + ξq;p) = upuqξp

;q = upup =

1,

−

and the part (3.5) of the constitutive equation valid for the isotropic un-
strained medium can be rewritten as:

(cid:3)

(cid:2)

(cid:3)(cid:2)
For producing the part of the constitutive equation that deals with the
eﬀects of the spatial deformation proper, we recall that an arbitrary de-
formation will bring the medium, which is now supposed to be isotropic
when at rest and unstrained, into a generic anisotropic condition. When the
magnetoelectric eﬀect is disregarded 5, the electromagnetic properties of an
anisotropic medium can be summarised, as shown e. g. by Sch¨opf [24], by
assigning two symmetric four-tensors ζik = ζki and κik = κki, whose fourth
row and column vanish in a coordinate system in which matter happens to
be locally at rest. This property ﬁnds tensorial expression in the equations
ζikuk = 0, κikuk = 0;
ζik has the rˆole of dielectric tensor, while κik acts as inverse magnetic per-
meability tensor. Let ηiklm be the Ricci-Levi Civita symbol in contravariant
form, while ηiklm is its covariant counterpart. Then the generally covariant
expression of the constitutive equation for the anisotropic medium reads
[24]:

We shall avail of this equation to account for Hik
(s.), i. e. for the part of Hik
produced, for a given Fmn, by the presence of ordinary strain in the otherwise
isotropic medium. The tensors ζ ik and κik will now be given a new meaning:
they represent henceforth only the changes in the dielectric properties and
in the inverse magnetic permeability produced by the presence of strain.
If the medium, as supposed, is thought to be isotropic when at rest and

5Such an eﬀect indeed exists [23], but it is suﬃciently rara avis to be neglected in the

present context.

10

S. ANTOCI AND L. MIHICH

in the unstrained state, the dependence of ζ ik and of κik on Spq will mimic
the dependence on the four-dimensional deformation tensor exhibited by the
elastic stress in an isotropic medium. One shall in fact write:

ζ km =

α1γkmγpq + α2(γkpγmq + γkqγmp)
(cid:3)

(cid:2)

Spq,

where the constants α1 and α2 specify the electrostrictive behaviour of the
isotropic medium. In the same way one is led to pose:

κkm =

β1γkmγpq + β2(γkpγmq + γkqγmp)
(cid:3)

(cid:2)

Spq

to account for the magnetostrictive behaviour; β1 and β2 are again the ap-
propriate magnetostrictive constants for the isotropic medium. By availing
of the deﬁnitions (6.6) and (6.7) one eventually writes

(6.6)

(6.7)

Hik

(6.8)

(uiζ km

(s.) = √g

(cid:3)
for the part of Hik due to the ordinary strain. The overall Hik is:

(cid:2)

(u.) + Hik

(s.),

2

and the two addenda at the right-hand side of this equation are the right-
hand sides of equations (6.3) and (6.8); therefore the overall constitutive
relation has just the form intimated by equation (6.1) for a general medium.
As we did when electrostriction and magnetostriction were neglected, we
assume again that the Lagrangian density L for the electromagnetic ﬁeld in
presence of the four-current density si shall read:

(6.10)

L =

HikFik

siϕi,

−

1
4

where ϕi is the four-vector potential, while Hik has the new deﬁnition (6.9).
Maxwell’s equations (4.3) and (4.4) are then obtained in just the same way
as it occurred with the Lagrangian density (4.1). Like Hik, also L can be
split into an “unstrained” part L
(u.), given by equation (4.1), and a term
stemming from strain, that will be called L
(s.). The Hamiltonian diﬀerenti-
ation of L
(u.) with respect to the metric gik produces the general relativistic
version of Abraham’s energy tensor, as we know from Section 4. For clear-
ness, we will rewrite it here as

writes:

In our path towards the equations of motion of elastic matter subjected to
electrodynamic forces we are now confronted with two options. We could
attempt evaluating the Hamiltonian derivative of L
(s.) with respect to gik,
then add the resulting tensor density to the overall energy tensor density
Tik, of which we already know the inertial term from (5.12) , the elastic part
from (5.11), and the “unstrained” electromagnetic component (6.11). The
vanishing divergence of Tik would then provide the equations of motion for
the ﬁelds ξi and ρ, once the appropriate substitutions have been made, in
keeping with the deﬁnition (5.5) of the four-velocity ui. This program meets
however with a certain diﬃculty: it requires assessing the metric content of
ξi
;k through extra assumptions of arbitrary character.

An alternative way is however oﬀered. One can determine directly, with-
out extra hypotheses, the contribution to the generalized force density fi(s.)
stemming from electrostriction through the Euler-Lagrange procedure:

If the metric gik is everywhere given by equation (3.1), and the velocity is so
small that uρ can be dealt with as a ﬁrst order inﬁnitesimal quantity, while
u4 diﬀers from unity only for second order terms, the Lagrangian density
(6.17) comes to read:

In the case of ﬂuid matter α2 is vanishing, and the expression of the force
density given by this equation agrees with the one predicted long ago by
Helmholtz with arguments about the energy of an electrostatic system [25],
and vindicated by experiments [26], [27] performed much later.

7. Conclusive remarks

The results of the previous Sections can be availed of in several ways. The
full general relativistic treatment would require a simultaneous solution of
Einstein’s equations, of Maxwell’s equations and of the equations Tik
;k = 0
fulﬁlled by the overall energy tensor, thereby determining in a consistent way
the metric gik, the four-potential ϕi, the “displacement” four-vector ξi, and
ρ. This approach is presently extra vires, due to our ignorance of the part
of Tik stemming from L
(s.), for the reason mentioned in the previous Sec-
tion. Achievements of lesser consistency are instead at hand, like solving the
equations for the electromagnetic ﬁeld and for the material ﬁeld described
by ξi and ρ with a given background metric, or ﬁnding the motion of elastic
matter with a ﬁxed metric, while the electromagnetic ﬁeld is evaluated as
if electrostriction were absent. Obviously enough, the calculations become
trivial when the metric is everywhere given by (3.1), while the motion of
matter occurs with non relativistic speed.
In the present paper we have
required that matter be isotropic when at rest and unstrained, but this lim-
itation was just chosen for providing a simple example. The theory can be
extended without eﬀort to cristalline matter exhibiting diﬀerent symmetry
properties, for which reliable experimental data have started accumulating
in recent years.

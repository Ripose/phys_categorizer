Abstract

The complete charge-current density and ﬁeld strength of an arbitrarily
accelerated relativistic point-charge are explicitly calculated. The current
density includes, apart from the well-established delta-function term which
is sufﬁcient for its global conservation, additional contributions depending
on the second and third proper-time derivatives of the position, which are
necessary for its local conservation as required by the internal consistency of
classical electrodynamics. Similarly, the ﬁeld strength includes an additional
delta-like contribution which is necessary for obtaining this result.

Introduction

Local conservation of the charge-current density 4-vector Jµ is a necessary con-
sequence of the antisymmetry of the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength tensor Fµν.
Indeed, the statement

derives from taking the 4-divergence of both sides of Maxwell’s inhomogeneous
equation

where the left-hand side vanishes after contraction because Fµν is antisymmetric.
This conclusion is absolutely general and should therefore be true for an arbitrar-
ily moving relativistic point-charge, that is for the charge-current density of the

Li´enard-Wiechert (LW) ﬁeld, which turns out not to be the case for the customary
formulation of this ﬁeld.

In this letter we show that if the LW current is properly calculated, which im-
plies that the LW ﬁeld strength must be supplemented by an additional δ-function-
like ﬁeld, local charge conservation is restored. This conclusion is obtained by
using only well known physical concepts, and a few basic results of distribution
theory, but at the expense of some lengthy calculations whose details are given in
another paper [1].

2 Deﬁnitions

Let Zµ be the 4-position of an arbitrarily moving relativistic point-charge, and Xµ
a point of observation. At the point Xµ the 4-potential Aµ, ﬁeld Fµν, and 4-current
density Jµ are functions of the null interval Rµ between Xµ and Yµ, i.e.,

Rµ := Xµ − Zµ,

such that

RµRµ = 0,

(2.1)

...
as well as of the 4-velocity ˙Zµ, 4-acceleration ¨Zµ, and 4-biacceleration
Zµ of the
...
Z µRµ. The
charge, to which three invariants are associated:
ﬁrst one is called the retarded distance,

˙ZµRµ, ¨ZµRµ, and

which enables to introduce a “unit” null 4-vector K deﬁned as

ξ := ˙ZµRµ,

K(θ, φ) := R/ξ,

and the so-called acceleration and biacceleration invariants deﬁned as

κ := ¨ZµK µ,

and

χ :=

...
Z µK µ.

The derivations of Fµν from the 4-potential, i.e.,

Fµν = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ,

and of Jµ according to Eq. (1.2), require that the partial derivatives are calculated
at the the position Xµ under the condition RµRµ = 0, which insures causality. For
an expression E = E(Xµ, τ ), where the argument Xµ corresponds to an explicit
dependence on Xµ, and τ to the proper time, this condition leads to the rule

∂µE(Xµ, τ ) = ∂µE(Xµ) + Kµ ˙E(τ )

(2.6)

In this equation the condition τ = τr implies that all quantities are evaluated at
the retarded proper time τr. In the sequel, for simplicity, this condition will be
speciﬁed explicitly only for the main equations.

3 The customary formulation

The potential of the LW ﬁeld can be obtained by a number of methods that are
explained in many text books, e.g., [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Most frequently it is obtained
by working in the Lorentz gauge, and by means of a Green’s function assuming
that the point-charge can be represented by a 3-dimensional δ-function. In the
covariant notation of this letter this source current-density can be written in the
following form

J S
µ =

e
4π

˙Zµ

ξ2 δ(ξ),

whose normalization corresponds to the global (or integral) form of charge con-
servation, i.e.,

This current differs from Eq. (3.1) by the presence of an additional term which
depends on the acceleration. However, when integrated over the whole 3-space
as in Eq. (3.2), J LW

multiplication by the volume element the acceleration dependent term does not
contribute to the radial integral since ξδ(ξ) = 0. Unfortunately, if one tries to
verify that the charge-current density J LW
is locally conserved, and consistently
uses again the rule (2.6) for the partial derivatives, one ﬁnds

yields the same total current e ˙Zµ as J S

Moreover, if instead of J LW

ﬁnds that it is not locally conserved. Only in the inertial limit, that is for non-
accelerated motion, are these two current densities locally conserved. This means
that something is wrong in the customary formulation of the electrodynamics of an
arbitrarily moving point-charge, or else that something is inconsistent and needs
to be clariﬁed.

4 The locally conserved current

Before explaining the reasons of the non local-conservation of the current J LW
, let
us ﬁnd out under which conditions the potential (3.3) leads to a locally conserved
current. In view of this we remark that any current distribution of the general form

µ

Jµ(X) =

e
4π (cid:16)

˙Zµ
ξ2 +

Sµ
ξ

+ Tµ

δ(ξ),

(cid:17)

where Sµ and Tµ are any continuous 4-vector functions, will satisfy global charge
conservation because of the identity ξδ(ξ) = 0. We therefore suppose that the
origin of the absence of local current conservation could be due to an incorrect
handling of the singularity at ξ = 0, which should in fact lead to a current having
a more complicated form than Eqs. (3.1) or (3.5). Thus, to proceed step by step
and be fully general, we begin by replacing the 1/ξ factor in the potential (3.3)
by a function ϕ(ξ) that is ﬁnite and indeﬁnitely differentiable except possibly at
ξ = 0, i.e.,

Aµ := e ˙Zµ(τ )ϕ(ξ)

.

τ =τr
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

Moreover, in order to make gauge invariance explicit, we write the equation for
the current density Jµ directly in terms of Aµ, i.e.,

∂ν∂νAµ − ∂µΛ = 4πJµ,

where

Λ = ∂νAν,

(4.3)

is the invariant scalar which is set equal to zero in the Lorentz gauge.

After a long but elementary calculation we ﬁnd

Λ = eκξϕ1(ξ),

where

ϕ1 := ϕ′ +

∂ν∂νAµ = e2 ¨Zµϕ1(ξ) − e(1 − 2κξ) ˙Zµ(ϕ′

(4.1)

(4.6)

By a tedious calculation we can then explicitly verify that ∂µJµ = 0, which is the
case for any three times differentiable functions Zµ(τ ) and ϕ(ξ), provided ξ 6= 0.
However, if ϕ(ξ) is a distribution rather than a regular function, the current density
Jµ will still be locally conserved, but the condition ξ 6= 0 will no more be required.

We now consider ϕ = 1/ξ. For ξ 6= 0 we have then

∀ξ > 0,

ϕ1(ξ) = −

1
ξ2 +

1
ξ2 = 0,

(4.7)

which implies that Eqs. (4.4) to (4.6) are all zero. The current density Jµ is then
everywhere zero, except at ξ = 0 where it is undeﬁned. We therefore interpret
ϕ = 1/ξ as a distribution, and use the theorem stating that a distribution which
has its support only in one point, say the origin, is a linear combination of the
δ-function and its derivatives up to a certain order [7, p.784]. Thus

∀ξ > 0,

ϕ1(ξ) = −

ξ2 =

(4.8)

which because of dimensionality comprises a single δ-function, and whose nor-
malization will turn out to be consistent with (3.2).
It remains to substitute
this expression in Eqs. (4.5) and (4.6), and the locally conserved current density
Eq. (4.3) is ﬁnally found to be

Jµ =

τ =τr
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

This leads to several observations:

1. The current density Jµ is much more complicated than the simple current
(3.1): It depends directly on the three invariants ξ, κ, and χ, as well as on
...
the two 4-vectors ˙Zµ and ¨Zµ; indirectly on the biacceleration
Z µ through the
invariant χ; and, ﬁnally, on the angular variables through the null 4-vector
Kµ(θ, φ).

2. The dependence on the third derivative of Zµ is consistent with the Lorentz-
Dirac equation and with the Schott expression of the self-force, in which
...
Z µ also appears, because the self-interaction force involves a product of Jµ
with the self-ﬁeld.

3. Eq. (4.9) has the most general distributional form of Eq. (4.1), in accord

with the theorem cited above Eq. (4.8).

5

4. The current Jµ and the invariant Λ depend on ϕ through ϕ1 in such a way

that if Λ(ξ) = 0, ∀ξ > 0, the current is zero. Thus, because

Λ = eκδ(ξ),

(4.10)

the gauge can be the Lorentz gauge Λ = 0 only for ξ 6= 0 when the
acceleration is non-zero, i.e., κ 6= 0.

5. The equation ϕ1(ξ) = ϕ′ + ϕ/ξ = 0, ∀ξ 6= 0, has only one solution: 1/ξ.
This singles out the corresponding potential as being the only one such that
the current density of a point-charge is conserved and thus given by Eq. (4.9).

5 Straightforward derivation

While the derivation in the previous section is rigorous, it is indirect in the sense
that it gives no explanation for the origin of the δ-functions, which by Schwarz’s
structure theorem of distribution theory must come from the differentiation of
some discontinuous function. In fact, the original discontinuity is easily found
because in 3-dimensional notation the retarded distance Eq. (2.2) reads

ξ = |~x − ~z|γ(1 − ~ρ · ~β),

(5.1)

where ~ρ is the unit vector in the direction of ~x − ~z. The retarded distance is
therefore proportional to an absolute value, and for this reason has a discontinuous
derivative when ~x → ~z, i.e., at ξ = 0.

Consequently, as is explained in details in Ref. [8], the potential of an arbitrarily

moving accelerated point-charge must be written

Aµ = e

Υ(ξ)

,

˙Zµ
ξ

τ =τr
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

where Υ(ξ) is the generalized function deﬁned as

and

Υ(r) = δ(r),

which explicitly speciﬁes how to consistently differentiate at ξ = 0.

When the deﬁnition (2.5) and the causal differentiation rule (2.6) are now used
to calculate the ﬁeld strength starting from the potential (5.2), the corresponding

6

current density (1.2) is directly found to be the conserved one, i.e., Eq. (4.9).
However, instead of the customary Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁeld of Eq. (3.4), the ﬁeld
strength is now

which apart from the presence of the Υ-function multiplying F LW
µν , has an addi-
tional δ-like contribution. Since both this Υ-factor and the δ-like contribution are
necessary to obtain the current density satisfying the local conservation Eq. (1.1),
it becomes clear why the customary F LW
cannot lead to such a current. In fact, it
µν
is by calculating the current density immediately from the potential as in Eq. (4.3)
— that is by ignoring that the ﬁeld could be different from the customary one —
that after many unsuccessful attempts the author discovered the conserved current
density.

6 Discussion

In this letter we have derived the proper formulation of the potential of an arbitrar-
ily moving point-charge, Eq. (5.2), which leads to the conserved current-density,
Eq. (4.9), which, most probably, has never been published. This means that there
is an apparent contradiction between this new result and the fact that the custom-
ary Li´enard-Wiechert formulation is an agreement with so many applications of
classical electrodynamics.

There is however no contradiction, since, on the contrary, the results of this
letter are in full agreement with the fundamental principles of electrodynamics
and mechanics. For instance, if the conserved current (4.9) is introduced in an
action integral as a scalar product JµAµ
ext with the potential of an external ﬁeld,
the differences between that current and the simple current J S
µ of Eq. (3.1) have
in general no inﬂuence since they disappear upon integration over the whole
space. The same is true for the derivation (which also involves an integration)
of the Li´enard-Wiechert potential, i.e., Eqs. (3.2) or (5.2), by means of a Green’s
function.

Thus, the principles of physics imply that the position Zµ and velocity ˙Zµ of a
point-charge are sufﬁcient to determine the potential of its ﬁeld, while the precise
formulation of that potential as in Eq. (4.9) is necessary to determine the complete

ﬁeld and conserved current-density, which include terms that are function of ¨Zµ
and
µ is sufﬁcient as a source
for determining uniquely the potential of an arbitrarily moving point-charge, the
conserved current Jµ deriving from this potential can be very different from J S.

In other words, while the simple current J S

In conclusion, the formulation presented in this letter will make little difference
for most applications of classical electrodynamics. However, as can be seen by
studying a number of examples, the instances in which the full details of the
current density (4.9) are strictly necessary, and the additional contribution (5.5) to
the ﬁeld essential, include fundamental problems like calculating the interaction of
a point-charge with itself, and similar problems in which classical electrodynamics
is apparently not consistent. The resolution of such internal contradictions is the
subject of several forthcoming publications.

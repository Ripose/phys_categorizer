TRUE TRANSFORMATIONS OF SPACETIME LENGTHS

AND APPARENT TRANSFORMATIONS OF SPATIAL AND

TEMPORAL DISTANCES. I. THE THEORY

It is shown in this paper that the diﬀerence between the two forms of relativity - the
”true transformation (TT) relativity” and - the ”apparent transformation (AT) relativity” is
essentially caused by the diﬀerence in the concept of sameness of a physical system, i.e., of a
physical quantity, for diﬀerent, relatively moving, observers. In the ”TT relativity” the same
quantity for diﬀerent inertial frames of reference is covariantly deﬁned four-dimensional (4D)
tensor quantity, which transforms according to the Lorentz transformation as the TT. In
the ”AT relativity” parts of a 4D tensor quantity are often considered as the same quantity
for diﬀerent observers, although they correspond to diﬀerent quantities in 4D spacetime,
and they are not connected by the Lorentz transformation than by the AT. Then the true
transformations of a spacetime length and the apparent transformations of a spatial distance
(the Lorentz contraction) and of a temporal distance (the usual dilatation of time) are
examined in detail. It is proved that only the true transformations of the spacetime length
are in agreement with the special relativity as the theory of a 4D spacetime with the pseudo-
Euclidean geometry.

I. INTRODUCTION

In [1] and [2] (see also [3]) two forms of relativity are discussed, the ”true transformations
(TT) relativity” and the ”apparent transformations (AT) relativity.” The notions of the TT
and the AT are ﬁrst introduced by Rohrlich [4], and, in the same meaning, but not under
that name, discussed in [5] too.

The TT are the transformations of the four-dimensional (4D) spacetime tensors referring
to the same quantity (in 4D spacetime) considered in diﬀerent inertial frames of reference
(IFRs), or in diﬀerent coordinatizations of some IFR. An example of the TT are the covari-
ant Lorentz transformations (LT) of 4D tensor quantities, (see [6] and [2]). Such covariant
LT as the TT are the transformations in 4D spacetime and they transform some 4D tensor
quantity Qa..

parts of the quantity are transformed). Since the ”TT relativity” is based on the TT of

physical quantities it is obviously the manifestly covariant formulation of the special rela-
tivity. However, there is an important diﬀerence between the usual covariant formulation of
the special relativity and the ”TT relativity.” Namely, it is considered in the usual covariant
formulation of the special relativity that the 4D spacetime tensor quantities, e.g., the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld tensor F ab, do have well-deﬁned mathematical meaning in the theory but,
nevertheless, the real physical meaning in experiments is assumed to be attributed not to
such 4D spacetime quantities than to some related quantities, e.g., the electric and magnetic
three-vectors (3-vectors) E and B, from the ”3+1” space and time. In the ”TT relativity”
only one sort of quantities, the 4D spacetime tensor quantities, do have well-deﬁned meaning
in our 4D spacetime, both, mathematical meaning in the theory, and a real physical mean-
ing in experiments; the complete and well-deﬁned measurement from the ”TT relativity”
viewpoint is such measurement in which all parts of some 4D quantity are measured.

In contrast to the TT the AT are not the transformations of 4D spacetime tensors and
they do not refer to the same 4D quantity, but to diﬀerent quantities in 4D spacetime.
Usually, depending on the used AT, only a part of a 4D tensor quantity is transformed by
the AT, and such a part of a 4D quantity, when considered in diﬀerent IFRs (or in diﬀerent
coordinatizations of some IFR), corresponds to diﬀerent quantities in 4D spacetime. Thus,
for example, the AT refer to the quantities deﬁned by the same way of measurement in
diﬀerent IFRs. An example of the ”AT relativity” is the conventional special relativity
based on two Einstein’s postulates and, consequently, on the relativity of simultaneity, on
the synchronous deﬁnition of the spatial length, i.e., on the AT of the spatial length (the
Lorentz contraction, see [4,5,1–3]), and the AT of the temporal distance (the conventional
dilatation of time), as will be proved in this paper, and, as shown in [1] (see also [3]), on the
AT of the electric and magnetic 3-vectors E and B (the conventional transformations of E
and B, see, e.g., [7], Sec.11.10).

In this paper, Sec.2, some general consideration on the two forms of relativity will be
done. In Sec.3 the TT of the spacetime length for - a moving rod, Sec.3.1, and - a moving
clock, Sec.3.2, are exposed. Then in Sec.4 the AT of - the spatial distance (the Lorentz
”contraction”), Sec.4.1, and of - the temporal distance (the time ”dilatation”), Sec.4.2, are
considered. Conclusions are given in Sec.5.

II. GENERAL CONSIDERATION ON THE ”TT RELATIVITY” AND THE ”AT

RELATIVITY”

The main diﬀerence between the ”TT relativity” and the ”AT relativity” stems from
the diﬀerence in the concept of sameness of a physical system, i.e., of a physical quantity,
for diﬀerent observers. That concept actually determines the diﬀerence in what is to be
understood as a relativistic theory.

In the ”TT relativity” as Rohrlich [4] states: ”The special theory of relativity is char-
acterized by the group of Lorentz transformations which describes the way two diﬀerent
observers relate their observations of the same physical systems.” (my emphasis) Then he
continues with the words taken here as a second motto: ”A quantity is therefore physically
meaningful (in the sense that it is of the same nature to all observers) if it has tensorial
properties under Lorentz transformations.” Similarly Gamba states in [5]: ”Special rela-

2

tivity gives us rules to compare results of an experiment performed by an observer S with
results obtained by another observer S ′, moving with constant velocity with respect to S. It
is, of course, implied that both obsevers are experimenting upon the same physical system
... ,” and ”The quantity Aµ(xλ, Xλ) for S is the same as the quantity A′
λ) for S ′ when
all the primed quantities are obtained from the corresponding unprimed quantities through
Lorentz transformations (tensor calculus).”

These examples show that in the the ”TT relativity” the special relativity is understood
as the theory of 4D spacetime with pseudo-Euclidean geometry. Quantities of physical
interest, both local and nonlocal, are represented by spacetime tensors, i.e., as covariant
quantities, and the laws of physics are written in a manifestly covariant way as tensorial
equations. Such an understanding of the special relativity and of the concept of sameness
of a physical system, i.e., of a physical quantity, is consistently applied in [1], [2] (see also
[3,8,9]) by extending the works [4] and [5] to the relativistic electrodynamics in terms of
the introduction of the four-vectors (4-vectors) Eα and Bα of the electric and magnetic
ﬁeld, respectively, and their TT, instead of the usual 3-vectors E and B and their AT (the
conventional transformations of E and B, [7]). It has to be noted that although Rohrlich
[4] and Gamba [5] clearly exposed the concept of sameness of a physical quantity in 4D
spacetime they also did not notice that the usual transformations of the 3-vectors E and B
[7] are - the AT, i.e., that E in S and E′ in S ′ do not refer to the same 4D tensor quantity.
The covariant formulation of electrodynamics with 4-vectors Eα and Bα is constructed in
[1–3] and shown to be equivalent to the usual covariant formulation with the electromagnetic
ﬁeld tensor F αβ. Also the covariant Majorana form of Maxwell’s equations is done in [2],
while in [1] (and [9]) the covariant form of the energy-momentum density tensor T αβ for the
electromagnetic ﬁeld and the fully covariant form of a nonlocal quantity, the electromagnetic
momentum 4-vector P α
f , are constructed in terms of the 4-vectors Eα and Bα. It has to be
noticed once again that in the ”TT relativity” only such 4D tensor quantities as are Eα and
Bα, F αβ, T αβ, P α
f , ..., are considered to be well-deﬁned not only mathematically but also
experimentally, as measurable quantities with real physical meaning.

The laws of physics written as tensorial equations with 4D spacetime tensors in an
IFR will have the same form in some other IFR, i.e., in new coordinates, if new and old
coordinates are connected by those coordinate transformations (the TT) that leave the
interval ds, and thus the pseudo-Euclidean geometry of the spacetime, unchanged. (It is
explicitly shown in [2] that the AT - the Lorentz contraction, as a coordinate transformation
in 4D spacetime, changes the inﬁnitesimal spacetime distance ds.) In fact, it is more correct
to say that the laws of physics will have the same form for those coordinate transformations
that leave the form, i.e., the functional dependence, of the metric tensor unchanged. Then
ds will also be unchanged under such coordinate transformations, but, generally, the reverse
does not hold. This means that in the reference frames that are connected by such coordinate
transformations all physical phenomena will proceed in the same way, (taking into account
the corresponding initial and boundary conditions), and thus there is no physical diﬀerence
between them, what is the content of the principle of relativity. The existence or nonexistence
of the group of transformations that assure the form-invariance of the metric tensor, and thus
also the form-invariance of the covariant equations (physical laws), is completely determined
by the spacetime geometry. Hence, one concludes that in the ”TT relativity” the principle
of relativity, in contrast to the Einstein formulation of the special relativity [10], is not a

3

fundamental principle, than it is a simple consequence of the spacetime geometry.

(The geometry of the spacetime is generally deﬁned by the invariant inﬁnitesimal space-

time distance ds of two neighboring points,

ds2 = dxagabdxb.

(1)

I adopt the following convention with regard to indices. Repeated indices imply summation.
Latin indices a, b, c, d, ... are to be read according to the abstract index notation, see [11],
Sec.2.4.. They designate geometric objects and they run from 0 to 3. Thus dxa,b and
gab, and of course ds (1), are deﬁned independently of any coordinate system, e.g., gab is a
second-rank covariant tensor (whose Riemann curvature tensor Ra
bcd is everywhere vanishing;
the spacetime of special relativity is a ﬂat spacetime, and this deﬁnition includes not only
the IFRs but also the accelerated frames of reference). Greek indices run from 0 to 3,
while latin indices i, j, k, l, ... run from 1 to 3, and they both designate the components of
some geometric object in some coordinate chart, e.g., xµ(x0, xi) and x′µ(x′0, x′i) are two
coordinate representations of the position 4-vector xa in two diﬀerent inertial coordinate
systems S and S ′, and gµν is the 4 × 4 matrix of components of gab in some coordinate chart.
Let the coordinate transformations from S to S ′ be x′µ = x′µ(xν). Then the metric tensor
µν(x′) = (∂xα/∂x′µ)(∂xβ/∂x′ν)gµν(x(x′)), and if the
gµν transforms according to the law g ′
coordinate transformations are such that they leave the form, i.e., the functional dependence,
of the metric tensor unchanged, then ds will necessarily be an invariant quantity under such
coordinate transformations.)

Since the ”TT relativity” deals on the same footing with all possible coordinatizations
of a chosen reference frame (inertial or accelerated), the second Einstein postulate referred
to the constancy of the coordinate velocity of light also does not hold in the ”TT relativity.”
Only in Einstein’s coordinatization (”e” coordinatization; when Einstein’s synchronization
of distant clocks and cartesian space coordinates xi are used in an IFR S) the coordinate,
one-way, speed of light is isotropic and constant.

Thus the basic elements of the ”TT relativity,” as a covariant formulation of the special
relativity, and of the usual Einstein’s formulation of the special relativity, are quite diﬀerent.
Einstein’s formulation is based on two postulates: the principle of relativity and the constancy
of the velocity of light. In the ”TT relativity” the primary importance is attributed to the
geometry of the spacetime; it is supposed that the geometry of our 4D spacetime is a pseudo-
Euclidean geometry in which only 4D tensor quantities do have real physical meaning. (The
similar ideas about the primary importance of the geometry of the spacetime, not only in
the general relativity but also in the special relativity, instead of Einstein’s postulates [10],
are expressed in several modern treatments, e.g., [12].)

Einstein [10], and many others, considered that general laws of physics must be covariant,
but for Einstein, and for the majority of physicists, such covariance of general laws does not
necessarily mean that the physical quantities of the theory have to be deﬁned in a covariant
manner, as covariant 4D tensor quantities. Thus, for example, Einstein [10] introduced
into the special relativity several quantities that are not covariantly deﬁned and whose
transformations are the AT. The examples are: the synchronously deﬁned spatial length with
the AT - the Lorentz contraction, the temporal distance with the AT - the time dilatation,
which will be discussed here. He also used the 3-vectors E and B in the formulation of

4

the relativistic electrodynamics, and derived their transformations, which are not the LT of
some well-deﬁned quantity in 4D spacetime and they do not refer to the same 4D quantity,
i.e., they are also the AT, as shown in [1] (and [3]). In all cases in which two quantities
connected by the AT are considered to refer to the same physical quantity in 4D spacetime
we have, what Gamba [5] calls, the case of mistaken identity. To better explain this issue
I quote Gamba’s words, [5]: ”As far as relativity is concerned, quantities like Aµ and A′
µ
(they are from diﬀerent IFRs S and S ′, and they are connected by the AT, my remark) are
diﬀerent quantities, not necessarily related to one another. To ask the relation between A′
µ
and Aµ, from the point of view of relativity, is like asking what is the relation between the
measurement of the radius of the Earth made by an observer S and the measurement of the
radius of Venus made by an observer S ′. We can certainly take the ratio of the two measures;
what is wrong is the tacit assumption that relativity has something to do with the problem
just because the measurements were made by two observers.” (At this point I remark once
again that neither Gamba, despite of such clear understanding of the concept of sameness
of a physical system in 4D spacetime, did not notice that the usual transformations of the
3-vectors E and B are, in fact, the AT, and in that respect he also dealt with the case of
mistaken identity.)

III. TRUE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE SPACETIME LENGTH

The whole above consideration is performed in order to emphasize the importance of the
geometry of 4D spacetime in the formulation of special relativity, and to point out general
diﬀerences between the ”TT relativity” and the ”AT relativity.” In the following sections
these diﬀerences will be illustrated considering some speciﬁc examples, the spacetime length
with its TT and then the spatial and temporal distances with their AT.

A. The spacetime length - for a moving rod

For the sake of completness we repeat (and in some measure expand) the main results
for the spacetime length, and for the AT of the spatial distance, that were already found in
[2]. The invariant spacetime length (the Lorentz scalar) between two points (events) in 4D
spacetime does have deﬁnite physical meaning in the ”TT relativity” and it is deﬁned as (in
the abstract index notation)

l = (lagablb)1/2,

(2)

where la(lb) is the distance 4-vector between two events A and B, la = la
A,B
are the position 4-vectors and gab is the metric tensor. Using diﬀerent coordinatizations of
a given reference frame one can ﬁnd diﬀerent expressions, i.e., diﬀerent representations of
the spacetime length l, Eq.(2). We shall consider l in two relatively moving IFRs S and
S ′ and in two coordinatizations ”e” and ”r” in these IFRs, where ”e” stands for Einstein’s
coordinatization in which Einstein’s synchronization of distant clocks and cartesian space
coordinates xi are used in an IFR, and where ”r” stands for ”radio” coordinatization of
an IFR in which ”everyday” or ”radio” synchronization of distant clocks is used, see [2].

AB = xa

B − xa

(Diﬀerent synchronizations are determined by the parameter ε in the relation t2 = t1 +
ε(t3 − t1), where t1 and t3 are the times of departure and arrival, respectively, of the light
signal, read by the clock at A, and t2 is the time of reﬂection at B, read by the clock at B,
that has to be synchronized with the clock at A. In Einstein’s synchronization convention
ε = 1/2 and the measured coordinate velocity of light is constant and isotropic. A nice
example of a non-standard synchronization is ”everyday” or ”radio” clock synchronization
[14] in which ε = 0 and there is an absolute simultaneity; see also [15]).

For further purposes we shall also need a covariant 4D expression for pure LT when

written in geometrical terms, see [6] and [2],

where ua is the proper velocity 4-vector of a frame S with respect to itself, ua = cna, na is
the unit 4-vector along the x0 axis of the frame S, and va is the proper velocity 4-vector of
S ′ relative to S, and u · v = uava. The form of the covariant 4D Lorentz transformations
(3) is independent of the chosen synchronization, i.e., coordinatization of reference frames.
With the use of (3) the transformation of covariantly deﬁned physical quantities reduces to
the evaluation of invariant scalar products, e.g., when La
b is applied to the position 4-vector
xa one ﬁnds (in the abstract index notation)

x′a = ga

When Einstein’s synchronization of distant clocks and cartesian space coordinates xi are
used in an IFR S then, e.g., the geometric object gab is represented by the 4 × 4 matrix of
components of gab in that coordinate chart, i.e., it is the Minkowski metric tensor gµν,e =
diag(−1, 1, 1, 1). Then La

Let us also consider the above relations in the ”r” coordinatization. By the same con-
struction as in [14] we can ﬁnd the relations between the base vectors in ”r” and ”e” coordi-
natizations. (We consider, as in [14] and [2] (but now in 4D spacetime), that the spacetime

6

is endowed with base vectors, the temporal and the spatial base vectors. The bases {eµ},
with the base vectors {e0, ei}, and {rµ} , with the base vectors {r0, ri} , are associated with
”e” and ”r” coordinatizations, respectively, of a given IFR.) The connection between the
bases {eµ} and {rµ} is

Then the metric tensor gab becomes gµν,r with

r0 = e0, ri = e0 + ei.

g00,r = g0i,r = gi0,r = gij,r(i 6= j) = −1, gii,r = 0.

The knowledge of gµν,r enable us to ﬁnd the transformation matrix between ”r” and ”e”
coordinatizations.

ν dxν, in his notation, [12] Sec.22.), and by the same matrix λµ

In [12] Logunov derived the expression for the transformation matrix connecting diﬀer-
entials of physical (how he named it) time and distance dX µ with the coordinate ones dxµ,
(dX µ = λµ
ν he connected a
physicaly measurable tensor with the coordinate one. Thus in the approach of [12] there
are physical and coordinate quantities for the same coordinatization of the considered IFR.
In my opinion both dX µ and dxν are equally well ”physical” and measurable quantities,
and we can interpret that dX µ corresponds to the Einstein coordinatization of a given IFR,
while dxν corresponds to some arbitrary coordinatization of the same IFR. Hence, in my
interpretation of Logunov results his matrix λµ
ν is, actually, the transformation matrix be-
tween some arbitrary coordinatization and the ”e” coordinatization. It has to be noted that
although in the Einstein coordinatization the space and time components of the position
4-vector do have their usual meaning, i.e., as in the prerelativistic physics, and in ds2
e the
spatial and temporal parts are separated, it does not mean that the ”e” coordinatization
does have some advantage relative to other coordinatizations and that the quantities in the
”e” base are more physical.

The elements of λµ

diagonal metric tensor then in ds2

same holds for the spacetime length l, see [2] for the results in 2D spacetime. Expressing

First we consider in short the same example as in [2], i.e., we consider a particular choice
AB (in the usual ”3+1” picture it corresponds to an object, a rod, that is
e − axes). For simplicity we work

for the 4-vector la
at rest in an IFR S and situated along the common x1
in 2D spacetime and the situation is pictured in Fig.1.

e, x′1

The base vectors are constructed as in [14] and [2], and here we expose this construction
once again for the sake of clearness of the whole exposition. The temporal base vector e0
is the unit vector directed along the world line of the clock at the origin. The spatial base
vector by deﬁnition connects simultaneous events, the event ”clock at rest at the origin
reads 0 time” with the event ”clock at rest at unit distance from the origin reads 0 time,”
and thus it is synchronization-dependent. The spatial base vector e1 connects two above
mentioned simultaneous events when Einstein’s synchronization (ε = 1/2) of distant clocks
is used. The temporal base vector r0 is the same as e0. The spatial base vector r1 connects
two above mentioned simultaneous events when ”radio” clock synchronization (ε = 0) of
distant clocks is used. All the spatial base vectors r1, r′
1, .. are parallel and directed along an
(observer-independent) light line. Hence, two events that are everyday (”r”) simultaneous
in S are also ”r” simultaneous for all other IFRs.

AB,e is chosen to be zero. The spacetime length l is written in the
{eµ} base as l = le = (lµ

that case a measure of the spatial distance, i.e., of the rest spatial length of the rod. The

the object, and the simultaneity of the events A and B in it, l0
e = 0, are chosen only to have
the connection with the prerelativistic physics (and the ”AT relativity”), which deals with
”3+1” quantities and not with 4D quantities. In the ”TT relativity,” for the same rod at
rest in S, we could take another choice for the 4-vector la
e 6= 0. The
”TT relativity,” unlike the nonrelativistic theory and the ”AT relativity,” is not interested
in the spatial points, the front and the rear ends of the rod, but in the events A and B
µo base in S ′,
in the 4D spacetime. The decomposition of the chosen la

the usual 3D length of a moving object cannot be deﬁned in the 4D spacetime of the TT

Another example, i.e., another particular choice for the 4-vector la

Fig.2. It clearly reveals the fundamental diﬀerence between the ”TT relativity” and the ”AT

considered in the ”TT relativity.” Again, as in the preceding section, the spacetime length

”e” and ”r” in these IFRs, i.e., in neµo , ne′
to be the rest frame of the muon. Two events are considered; the event A represents the
creation of the muon and the event B represents its decay after the lifetime τ0 in S. The

Now in the ne′

The notion of the time dilatation, which is in the ”AT relativity” based on the comparison of
only the temporal parts, is meaningless in the ”TT relativity.” However the correctly deﬁned
quantity is again the spacetime length, and in S ′ this length is l = l′

Comparing the temporal parts of lµ

r for −1/2 ≺ βr ≺ 0. Speaking in the language of
the ”AT relativity” one could say that for the positive βr there is a ”time dilatation” while
for −1/2 ≺ βr ≺ 0 there is a ”time contraction.” Since there is no physical reason for the
preference of one coordinatization over the other we once again conclude that the comparison
of only temporal (or spatial) parts of the distance 4-vectors is physically meaningless. This
example nicely reveals the untenability of the notions from the ”AT relativity” (the ”Lorentz

contraction” or the ”time dilatation”) in the ”TT relativity” as the theory of 4D spacetime
with pseudo-Euclidean geometry. However, e.g., the spacetime length is always correctly
deﬁned quantity that takes the same value in both IFRs and in both coordinatizations,
l = l′
e = le; it can be compared in a physically meaningful sense in the ”TT
relativity.”

r = lr = l′

We see that the geometrical quantities, the 4-vectors, xa

AB have diﬀerent repre-
sentations depending on the chosen IFR and the chosen coordinatization of that IFR, e.g.,
xµ
e,r, x′µ
e,r. Although the Einstein coordinatization is preferred by physicists due to its simplic-
ity and symmetry it is nothing more ”physical” than others, e.g., the ”r” coordinatization.

IV. THE AT OF SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTANCES

In this section we consider the same two examples as above but now from the point
of view of the conventional, i.e., Einstein’s [10] interpretations of the spatial length of the
moving rod and the temporal distance for the moving clock.

A. The AT of the spatial distance or

the Lorentz ”contraction”

The AT of the spatial distance is already considered in detail in [2] and therefore, here, we
only quote the main results and the deﬁnitions, and also illustrate the whole consideration
by Fig.3. The same example, a rod at rest in S, is pictured in Fig.1 when treated in the
”TT relativity,” and in Fig.3 when treated in the ”AT relativity.” It is mentioned in [2]
that the synchronous deﬁnition of the spatial length, introduced by Einstein [10], deﬁnes
length as the spatial distance between two spatial points on the (moving) object measured
by simultaneity in the rest frame of the observer.

FIG. 3. The AT of the spatial length - the Lorentz ”contraction” of the moving rod. The spatial
distance l1
e = l0 deﬁnes in the ”AT relativity,” and in the ”e” base, the spatial
length of the rod at rest in S, while l′1
e is considered in the ”AT relativity,” and
in the ”e” base, to deﬁne the spatial length of the moving rod in S ′. l′1
e = l0 are connected
by the formulae for the Lorentz contraction of the moving rod l′1
e = b
and tBe = tAe = te = a. a in S and b in S ′ are not related by the LT or any other coordinate
transformation. Likewise in the ”r” base, the spatial distance l1
Er deﬁnes in the ”AT
relativity” the spatial length of the rod at rest in S, while l′1
Gr deﬁnes the spatial
length of the moving rod in S ′.
EF r = l0 are connected by the formulae
for the Lorentz ”contraction” of the moving rod in the ”r” base l′1
Gr and
x0
F r = x0
r ≻ l0 for −1/2 ≺ βr ≺ 0 and the
standard ”length contraction” l0 ≻ l′1
r ≻ 0 for positive βr, which clearly shows that the ”Lorentz
contraction” is not physically correctly deﬁned transformation.
In the ”AT relativity” all four
spatial lengths l1
r are considered as the same quantity for diﬀerent observers, but, in
fact, they are four diﬀerent quantities in 4D spacetime, and they are not connected by the Lorentz
transformation.

where βe = ve/c, ve is the relative velocity of S and S ′. We see that the spatial lengths
l1
e = l0 and l′1
e = l0/γe refer not to the same 4D tensor quantity, as in the ”TT relativity,”
but to two diﬀerent quantities in 4D spacetime. These quantities are obtained by the same
measurements in S and S ′; the spatial ends of the rod are measured simultaneously at some
te = a in S and also at some t′
e = b in S ′, and a in S and b in S ′ are not related by the LT
or any other coordinate transformation.

The Lorentz ”contraction” in the ”r” coordinatization is also considered in [2] and pic-
tured in Fig.3 here. The spatial ends of the considered rod, which is at rest in S, must be
taken simultaneously in the ”r” coordinatization too. Thus, in the ”r” base, they must lie on
the light line, i.e., on the x1
r axis (that is along the spatial base vector r1). The simultaneous
events E and F (whose spatial parts correspond to the spatial ends of the rod) are the
intersections of the x1
r axis and the world lines of the spatial ends of the rod. The events E
and F are not the same events as the events A and B, considered in the ”e” base for the
same rod at rest in S, since the simultaneity of the events is deﬁned in diﬀerent ways, see
Fig.3. Therefore, in 4D spacetime the spatial length in the ”r” base l1
Er)
is not the same 4D quantity as the spatial length in the ”e” base l1
Ae).
Applying the same procedure as in [2] one ﬁnds that in the ”r” base, the spatial distance
EF r = x1
l1
Er deﬁnes in the ”AT relativity” the spatial length of the rod at rest in S,
while l′1
Hr − x′1
Gr deﬁnes the spatial length of the moving rod in S ′, see Fig.3. Using
these deﬁnitions one ﬁnds the relation between l′1
EF r = l0 as the Lorentz
”contraction” of the moving rod in the ”r” base

(19)

r ≻ l0 for −1/2 ≺ βr ≺ 0 and the standard length ”contraction” l0 ≻ l′1

In contrast to the ”e” coordinatization we ﬁnd that in the ”r” base there is a length dilatation
∞ ≻ l′1
r ≻ 0 for
positive βr, which clearly shows that the ”Lorentz contraction” is not physically correctly
deﬁned transformation.

At the beginning of Sec.2 we have stated that the main diﬀerence between the ”TT
relativity” and the ”AT relativity” stems from the diﬀerence in the concept of sameness of
a physical quantity for diﬀerent observers. This statement becomes clear when we compare
Fig.1 and Fig. 3 and the considerations performed in Sec.3.1. and in this one. From Fig.1
and Sec.3.1. we see that in the ”TT relativity” the same quantity for diﬀerent observers is
the geometrical quantity, the 4-vector la
AB; only one quantity in 4D spacetime. On the other
hand from Fig.3 and the discussion in this section we see that in the ”AT relativity” all four
spatial lengths l1
r are considered as the same quantity for diﬀerent observers, but
they are actually four diﬀerent quantities in 4D spacetime.

Thus we conclude that - the Lorentz contraction is the transformation that connects
diﬀerent quantities (in 4D spacetime) in diﬀerent IFRs, which shows that it belongs to - the
AT.

B. The AT of the temporal distance or the time ”dilatation”

In the ”AT relativity” one can speak not only about the spatial distance but also about
the temporal distance, and they are considered as well deﬁned quantities. In Fig.4 we present
the same ”muon experiment” as in Fig.2.

FIG. 4. The AT of the temporal distance - the ”dilatation” of time for the moving clock. The
temporal distance l0
e deﬁnes in the ”AT relativity,” and in the ”e” base, the muon lifetime
at rest, while l′0
e is considered in the ”AT relativity,” and in the ”e” base, to deﬁne the
lifetime of the moving muon in S ′. The quantities l′0
e are connected by the relation for the
time dilatation, l′0
e /c = t′
Ae. Likewise, the temporal
distance l0
ABr = l0
r deﬁnes in the ”AT relativity,” and in the ”r” base, the muon lifetime at rest,
while l′0
is considered in the ”AT relativity,” and in the ”r” base, to deﬁne the lifetime
of the moving muon in S ′. l′0
r are connected by the relation for the time ”dilatation” in
the ”r” base l′0
in S ′, where the clock is
moving, is smaller - ”time contraction” - than the temporal separation l0
r = cτ0 in S, where the
clock is at rest, for −1/2 ≺ βr ≺ 0, and it is larger - ”time dilatation” - for 0 ≺ βr ≺ ∞. The
”AT relativity” considers the temporal distances l0
r as the same quantity for diﬀerent
observers. However these temporal distances are really diﬀerent quantities in 4D spacetime, and
they are not connected by the Lorentz transformations.

Instead of to work with geometrical quantities xa

relativity,” only with the spatial, or temporal, parts of their coordinate representations
xµ
Ae,r, xµ
e,r. First the ”e” coordinatization, which is almost always used in the ”AT
relativity,” is considered here. In 4D (at us 2D) spacetime and in the ”e” coordinatization
the events A and B are again on the world line of a muon that is at rest in S. The
distance 4-vector (in the ”e” base) is lµ
Ae = (cτ0, 0). Further one uses the
Lorentz transformations to express x′µ
ABe in S ′, in which the muon is moving,
in terms of the corresponding quantities in S. This procedure yields x′0
A,Be =
γe(ctA,Be − βex1

A,Be = γe(βectA,Be − x1

Now comes the main diﬀerence between the two forms of relativity.
Instead of to work
with 4D tensor quantities and their LT (as in the ”TT relativity”) in the ”AT relativity”
the temporal part alone l0
ABe is considered as a well-deﬁned quantity, and it
ABe of lµ
deﬁnes the muon lifetime at rest. The existence of the spatial part l1
ABe is in this case
completely neglected; one forgets the transformation of the spatial part l1
ABe and considers
only the transformation of the temporal part l0
ABe. However, in the 4D (at us 2D) spacetime
such an assumption means that in S ′ one actually does not consider the same events A
and B as in S but some other two events C and D (in fact, in this speciﬁc example, the
events A and D), see Fig.4. Then in the above transformation for l0
ABe one has to write
x′0
ABe = l0
De − x′0
ABe. As we said the temporal distance l0
e
deﬁnes in the ”AT relativity,” and in the ”e” base, the muon lifetime at rest, while l′0
ADe = l′0
e
is considered in the ”AT relativity,” and in the ”e” base, to deﬁne the lifetime of the moving
muon in S ′. Taking that x1
e one ﬁnds the well-known relation
for the time dilatation,

As seen from Fig.4 the relation (20) connects two diﬀerent quantities (in 4D spacetime) - the
µo representations
temporal parts of lµ
of the distance 4-vector la
e are diﬀerent and, in fact, independent
quantities in 4D spacetime, which are not connected by the Lorentz transformation.

In the ”r” coordinatization, see Fig.4., the {rµ} representation of the distance 4-vector
is lµ

Ar = (cτ0, 0). By means of the LT (3), when written in the {rµ} base, we

Further, in the ”r” base, one again forgets the transformation of the spatial part l1
ABr.
In the same way as in the ”e” base, in 4D (at us 2D) spacetime, such an assumption means
that in S ′ one actually does not consider the same events A and B as in S but some other
two events G and H, (in this particular example, the events A and H), see Fig.4. Then in
the above transformation for l0
ABr; the temporal
distance l0
r deﬁnes in the ”AT relativity,” and in the ”r” base, the muon lifetime at
rest, while l′0
r is considered in the ”AT relativity,” and in the ”r” base, to deﬁne the
lifetime of the moving muon in S ′. The relation for the time ”dilatation” in the ”r” base
becomes

Again, as seen from Fig.4, the relation (21) connects two diﬀerent quantities (in 4D space-
µo
ABr and l′µ
time) - the temporal parts of lµ
representations of the distance 4-vector la
r are diﬀerent and, in
fact, independent quantities in 4D spacetime, which are not connected by the Lorentz trans-
formation. We see from (21) that the temporal separation l′0
in S ′, where the clock is
r
moving, is smaller - ”time contraction” - than the temporal separation l0
r = cτ0 in S, where
the clock is at rest, for −1/2 ≺ βr ≺ 0, and it is larger - ”time dilatation” - for 0 ≺ βr ≺ ∞.
In numerous papers and books the time dilatation given by (20) is considered as a funda-
mental relativistic eﬀect, but as shown by the relation (21) the eﬀect depends on the chosen
coordinatizations, and as such cannot be the fundamental eﬀect. In addition, we point out
that from the point of view of the ”TT relativity” such transformations that transform
only some parts of 4D tensor quantities, and completely neglect the transformations of the
remaining parts, are physically meaningless.

From Fig.2 and Sec.3.2. we see that in the ”TT relativity” the same quantity for diﬀerent
observers is the geometrical quantity, the 4-vector la
AB; only one quantity in 4D spacetime.
However from Fig.4 and this section we reveal that in the ”AT relativity” diﬀerent quantities
in 4D spacetime, the temporal distances l0
r , are considered as the same quantity
for diﬀerent observers.

e, l′0

One concludes from the above discussion that both the Lorentz ”contraction” and the
time ”dilatation” are the transformations connecting diﬀerent quantities (in 4D spacetime)
in diﬀerent IFRs, and they both change the inﬁnitesimal spacetime distance ds, i.e., the
pseudo-Euclidean geometry of the 4D spacetime (this is explicitly shown in [2] for the Lorentz

”contraction,” and also it can be easily shown for the time ”dilatation”). Such characteristics
of the Lorentz ”contraction” and the time ”dilatation” as the coordinate transformations show
that both transformations belong to - the AT.

V. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

As shown in this paper the two forms of relativity the ”TT relativity” and the ”AT rel-
ativity” are substantially diﬀerent theories. The concept of sameness of a physical quantity
for diﬀerent observers makes clear distinction between the two considered forms of relativity.
In the ”TT relativity” the same quantity for diﬀerent observers is the geometrical quantity,
only one quantity in 4D spacetime; in the case considered in this paper it is the 4-vector la
AB,
(or the spacetime length l, the Lorentz scalar), as seen from Figs.1 and 2. In contrast to
the ”TT relativity” the traditionally used ”AT relativity,” considers diﬀerent spatial lengths
l1
e, l′1
r , Fig.4) as the same quantity for
diﬀerent observers. However, as seen from Fig.3 (Fig.4) the spatial lengths l1
r (the
temporal distances l0
r ) are really diﬀerent quantities in 4D spacetime, which are
not connected by the Lorentz transformations La
e and
e ) are not connected by Lµ
r (l0
l′0
ν,e and
Lµ
b in the ”e” and ”r” coordinatizations, see Sec.3). Also,
r, etc., are connected by the coordinate transformation T µ
neither the quantities l1
ν ,
which transforms the ”e” coordinatization to the ”r” coordinatization, see Sec.3.

The consideration of the spacetime length (the ”TT relativity”) Sec.3, and of the spatial
and temporal distances as well-deﬁned quantities (the ”AT relativity”) Sec.4, reveals that
only the ”TT relativity” is in a complete agreement with the special relativity as the theory
of 4D spacetime with pseudo-Euclidean geometry; when the 4D structure of our spacetime
is correctly taken into account as in the ”TT relativity” then there is no place either for
the Lorentz ”contraction” or for the time ”dilatation,” i.e., there is no place for the ”AT
relativity.”

rod l′1
e = b and tBe = tAe = te = a. a in S and b in S ′ are
not related by the LT or any other coordinate transformation. Likewise in the ”r” base, the

r ≻ l0 for −1/2 ≺ βr ≺ 0 and the standard ”length

r ≻ 0 for positive βr, which clearly shows that the ”Lorentz contraction”
is not physically correctly deﬁned transformation. In the ”AT relativity” all four spatial
lengths l1
r are considered as the same quantity for diﬀerent observers, but, in fact,
they are four diﬀerent quantities in 4D spacetime, and they are not connected by the Lorentz
transformation.

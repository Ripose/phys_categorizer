Abstract

A new ether-drift experiment in D¨usseldorf is currently measuring the relative frequency shift

of two cryogenic optical resonators upon active rotations of the apparatus. I point out that

the observed fractional amplitude of the sidereal variations of the signal in February, Csid ∼
(11 ± 2) · 10−16, is entirely consistent with the expectations based on Miller’s observations
in the same epoch of the year. This leads to predict that, with future data collected in

August-September, the observed sidereal variations should increase by ∼ +70%, i.e. up
to Csid ∼ (19 ± 2) · 10−16 retaining the present normalization. This would represent clean
experimental evidence for the existence of a preferred frame.

1. Modern ether-drift experiments look for a preferred frame by measuring the relative
frequency shift δν between two cavity-stabilized lasers upon local rotations [1] or under the

Earth’s rotation [2]. Today, by combining the possibility of active rotations of the apparatus

with the use of cryogenic optical resonators, a new experiment [3] is currently trying to push
the relative accuracy of the measurements to the level O(10−16).
that such an extremely high precision, that strongly constrains the anisotropy of the speed

It is generally believed

of light, can also rule out the idea of a preferred frame.

However, as discussed in Refs.[4, 5] (see also [6]), vanishingly small values of δν, by

themselves, cannot rule out the old Lorentzian formulation of Relativity.

In fact, if light

propagates isotropically in a preferred frame Σ, the relative frequency shift observed on the

where Nmedium ∼ 1 is the refractive index of the medium where light propagation takes place

and vearth denotes the Earth’s velocity with respect to Σ (value projected in the plane of the

Earth is given by

interferometer).

This frequency shift vanishes identically when the speed of light coincides with the same

parameter ”c” entering Lorentz transformations, i.e.

in an ideal vacuum where Nvacuum =

1. Starting from this observation, one can re-read [4, 5] the classical and modern ether-

drift experiments in a consistent framework where there is a preferred frame relatively to

which the Earth is moving with a velocity ∼ 200 km/s (value projected in the plane of the

interferometer). This velocity is consistent with the values deduced by Miller (see Table V

of Ref.[7]) on the base of the sidereal variations of the ether-drift eﬀect in diﬀerent periods

of the year.

The aim of this Letter is to show that the sidereal variations observed in February by

the authors of Ref.[3] are completely consistent with Miller’s observations in the same epoch

of the year. This also suggests a precise prediction to be tested with future data collected

in the period of August-September. A conﬁrmation of this prediction would represent clean

experimental evidence for the existence of a preferred frame.

2. The basic ingredient for our analysis is the relation [4] for the frequency shift of two

orthogonal optical resonators to O(

Here θ = 0 indicates the direction of the ether-drift, ¯u′(θ) is the two-way speed of light
(as measured on the Earth) in a medium of refractive index Nmedium ∼ 1, Bmedium ∼

−3(Nmedium − 1) and u = c/Nmedium indicates the isotropical value. Eq.(2) is derived under

the assumption that light is seen isotropical in a preferred frame Σ and that the required

trasformation law to the Earth’s frame is a Lorentz transformation.

In this way one obtains an amplitude of the ether-drift eﬀect

that vanishes identically in a vacuum.

However, as originally suggested in Ref.[6], even in the case of an extremely high vacuum

(such as the one existing in the resonating cavities of Ref.[3]) one can argue that the speed

of light diﬀers from the parameter ”c” entering Lorentz transformations.

In fact, for an

apparatus placed on the Earth’s surface (but otherwise in free fall with respect to any other

gravitational ﬁeld), General Relativity predicts a tiny refractive index

which is much larger than the theoretical prediction in Eq.(7). Therefore, as suggested by

the same authors of Ref.[3], for a meaningful comparison, one has to subtract the mean value

and restrict to the sidereal modulations of the signal.

To predict the variations of the ether-drift eﬀect, I shall use the average data and the the-

oretical curves reported by Miller in Figs.26 of Ref.[7]. To compare with the data collected

around February 6th (of 2005) by the authors of Ref.[3], I’ll also restrict to Miller’s observa-

tions around February 8th (of 1926). In this case, the sidereal variations of the ether-drift

eﬀect are modest and the proﬁle of the observable velocity is found in the range 7.5 km/s
≤ vobs(t) ≤ 10 km/s. Using Eq.(13) of Ref.[4], v2

ferometer that was operating in air where Nair ∼ 1.00029), this range of observable velocities

Therefore, taking into account Eqs.(3) and (6), the amplitude of the signal should lie in the

range 0.42 Hz≤ Ath(t) ≤ 0.76 Hz, with an overall daily variation

that represents a fractional change

An experimental check of this prediction can be found in Table I of Ref.[3]. There one ﬁnds

a clear indication for a non-zero value of the parameter

implies a daily variation of the amplitude

that is entirely consistent with the theoretical value in Eq.(12).

By itself, this result might be considered a ﬁrst experimental check of the ether-drift

observations reported by Miller. However, for a real precision test, one has still to wait a few

months. In fact, looking again at Figs.26 of Ref.[7], one discovers that the sidereal variations

in August-September were considerably larger with a proﬁle of the observable velocities lying

now in the range 5.0 km/s ≤ vobs(t) ≤ 10 km/s. This range corresponds to

and to

with fractional changes of ∼ ±10 · 10−16. In this case, the ﬁtted value of the coeﬃcient Csid
should increase by ∼ +70%. Retaining the present normalization, this means up to

that represents a 3-4 σ change relatively to the present value and might be observable with

future data taken in the next few months.

3. The new generation of Michelson-Morley experiments with rotating cryogenic optical
resonators will likely deﬁnitely resolve, in one way or the other, the old controversy (Ein-

steinian vs. Lorentzian) on the interpretation of the relativistic eﬀects. In this Letter, I have

illustrated the implications of Miller’s observations for the present experiment in D¨usseldorf

of Ref.[3] and the forthcoming one in Berlin [8]. The present amplitude of the sidereal vari-

ations observed in February 2005 by the authors of Ref.[3], as embodied in the parameter
Csid ∼ (11 ± 2) · 10−16, is completely consistent with the prediction based on Miller’s data
collected in the same epoch of the year.

However, for a real deﬁnitive check, the ﬁtted value of Csid should also increase by ∼ +70%
when taking data in August-September, i.e. up to Csid ∼ (19 ± 2) · 10−16 retaining the same
normalization. This prediction will be tested in the next few months and, whenever conﬁrmed,

would represent clean experimental evidence for the existence of a preferred frame. If this

will happen, further checks will require to determine the azimuth of the ether-drift eﬀect

and, with it, the cosmic component of the Earth’s velocity. To this end, the data should be

analyzed in a model-independent way without necessarily restricting the preferred frame to

coincide with the CMBR.

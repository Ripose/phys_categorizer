Abstract

We will display the fundamental structure of classical electrody-
namics. Starting from the axioms of (1) electric charge conservation,
(2) the existence of a Lorentz force density, and (3) magnetic ﬂux
conservation, we will derive Maxwell’s equations. They are expressed
in terms of the ﬁeld strengths (E,
, H), and the
B
sources (ρ, j). This fundamental set of four microphysical equations
has to be supplemented by somewhat less general constitutive assump-
tions in order to make it a fully determined system with a well-posed
initial value problem. It is only at this stage that a distance concept
(metric) is required for space-time. We will discuss one set of possible

1 Introduction

Is it worthwhile to reinvent classical electrodynamics after it has been with
us for more than a century? And after its quantized version, quantum elec-
trodynamics (uniﬁed with the weak interaction) had turned out to be one of
the most accurately tested successful theories? We believe that the answer
should be aﬃrmative. Moreover, we believe that this reformulation should
be done such that it is also comprehensible and useful for experimental physi-
cists and (electrical) engineers1.

Let us collect some of the reasons in favor of such a reformulation. First
of all an “axiomatics” of electrodynamics should allow us to make the funda-
mental structure of electrodynamics transparent, see, e.g., Sommerfeld [16]
or [1, 7, 20]. We will follow the tradition of Kottler-Cartan-van Dantzig, see
Truesdell & Toupin [19] and Post [10], and base our theory on two experi-
mentally well established axioms expressed in terms of integrals, conservation
of electric charge and magnetic ﬂux, and a local axiom, the existence of the
Lorentz force. All three axioms can be formulated in a 4-dimensional (space-
time) continuum without using the distance concept (i.e. without the use of a
metric), see Schr¨odinger [15]. Only the fourth axiom, a suitable constitutive
law, is speciﬁc for the “material” under consideration which is interacting
with the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The vacuum is a particular example of such
a material. In the fourth axiom, the distance concept eventually shows up
and gives the 4-dimensional continuum an additional structure.

Some of the questions one can answer with the help of such a general
a microscopic quantity like the
framework are: Is the electric excitation
D
ﬁeld strength E? Is it justiﬁed to give
another dimension than E? The
analogous questions can be posed for the magnetic excitation H and the ﬁeld
. Should we expect a magnetic monopole and an explicit magnetic
strength
charge to arise in such an electrodynamic framework? Can we immediately
pinpoint the (metric-independent) constitutive law for a 2-dimensional elec-
tron gas in the theory of the quantum Hall eﬀect? Does the non-linear Born-
Infeld electrodynamics ﬁt into this general scheme? How do Maxwell’s equa-
tions look in an accelerated reference frame or in a strong gravitational ﬁeld
as around a neutron star? How do they look in a possible non-Riemannian
spacetime? Is a possible pseudoscalar axion ﬁeld compatible with electrody-
1For this reason, we apply in this article the more widespread formalism of tensor
analysis (“Ricci calculus”, see Schouten [14]) rather than that of exterior diﬀerential forms
(“Cartan calculus”, see Frankel [5]) which we basically prefer.

namics? And eventually, on a more formal level, is the calculus of exterior
diﬀerential forms more appropriate for describing electrodynamics than the
3-dimensional Euclidean vector calculus and its 4-dimensional generalization?
Can the metric of spacetime be derived from suitable assumptions about the
constitutive law?

It is really the status of electrodynamics within the whole of physics which
comes much clearer into focus if one follows up such an axiomatic approach.

2 Foliation of the 4-dimensional spacetime con-

tinuum

From a modern relativistic point of view, the formulation of electrodynam-
ics has to take place in a 4-dimensional continuum (diﬀerentiable manifold)
which eventually is to be identiﬁed with spacetime, i.e. with a continuum de-
scribed by one “time” coordinate x0 and three “space” coordinates x1, x2, x3
or, in short, by coordinates xi, with i = 0, 1, 2, 3. Let us suppress one space
dimension in order to be able to depict the 4-dimensional as a 3-dimensional
continuum, as shown in Fig.1.

n

hσ3
hσ2
hσ1

Figure 1: Foliation of spacetime: Each hypersurface hσ represents, at a time
σ, the 3-dimensional space of our perception one dimension of which is sup-
pressed in the ﬁgure. The positive time direction runs upwards.

3

We assume that this continuum admits a foliation into a succession of dif-
ferent leaves or hypersurfaces h. Accordingly, spacetime looks like a pile of
leaves which can be numbered by a monotonically increasing (time) parame-
ter σ. A leaf hσ is deﬁned by σ(xi) = const. It represents, at a certain time σ,
the ordinary 3-dimensional space surrounding us (in Fig.1 it is 2-dimensional,
since one dimension is suppressed).

At any given point in hσ, we can introduce the covector ki := ∂iσ and
a 4-vector n = (ni) = (n0, n1, n2, n3) = (n0, na) such that n is normalized
according to

ni ki = ni∂iσ = 1 .
Here a, b . . . = 1, 2, 3 and i, j . . . = 0, 1, 2, 3. Furthermore, summation over
repeated indices is always understood. The vector ni is “normal” to the leaf
hσ, whereas the covector ki is tangential2 to it.

(1)

With the pair (n, k) we can construct projectors which decompose all
tensor quantities into longitudinal and transversal constituents with respect
to the vector n, see Fig.2. Indeed, the matrices

and T i

j := δi

represent projection operators, i.e.

Taking an arbitrary covector Ui, we now can write it as

Ui = ⊥Ui + U i , where ⊥Ui := Lj

i Uj

and U i := T j

i Uj .

(4)

Obviously ⊥Ui describes the longitudinal component of the covector and U i
its transversal component, with ni U i = 0. Analogously, for an arbitrary
vector V i, we can write

V i = ⊥V i + V i , where ⊥V i := Li

(5)
Its transversal component V i fulﬁlls V i ki = 0. This pattern can be straight-
forwardly generalized to all tensorial quantities of spacetime.

and V i := T i

j V j .

j V j

For simplicity, we conﬁne our attention to the particular case when “adapt-
ed” coordinates xi = (σ, xa) are used and when the “spatial” components of
n vanish, i.e., ni = (1, 0, 0, 0).
In that case, we simply have ki = ∂iσ =
(1, 0, 0, 0) and hence σ can be treated as a formal “time” coordinate.

2The term “tangential” is used here in the sense of exterior calculus in which a covector
(or 1-form) is represented by two ordered parallel planes – and the ﬁrst plane is tangential
to hσ.

3 Conservation of electric charge (axiom 1)

The conservation of electric charge was already recognized as fundamental
law during the time of Franklin (around 1750) well before Coulomb discov-
ered the force law in 1785. Nowadays, at a time, at which one can catch
single electrons and single protons in traps and can count them individu-
ally, we are more sure than ever that electric charge conservation is a valid
fundamental law of nature. Therefore matter carries as a primary quality
something called electric charge which only occurs in positive or negative
units of an elementary charge e (or, in the case of quarks, in 1/3th of it)
and which can be counted in principle. Thus it is justiﬁed to introduce the
physical dimension of charge q as a new and independent concept. Ideally
one should measure a charge in units of e/3. However, for practical reasons,
the SI-unit C (Coulomb) is used in laboratory physics.

Two remarks are in order: Charge is an additive (or extensive) quantity
that characterizes the source of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. It is prior to the
notion of the electric ﬁeld strength. Therefore it is not reasonable to measure,
as is done in the CGS-system of units, the additive quantity charge in terms
of the unit of force by applying Coulomb’s law. Coulomb’s law has no direct

Ω3

relation to charge conservation. Secondly, in the SI-system, for reasons of
better realization, the Ampere A as current is chosen as the new fundamental
unit rather than the Coulomb. We have C = A s (s = second).

As a preliminary step, let us remind ourselves that, in a 4-dimensional
picture, the motion of a point particle is described, as in Fig.2, by a curve
in spacetime, by a so-called worldline. The tangent vectors of this worldline
represent the 4-velocity of the particle.

If we mark a 3-dimensional volume Ω3 which belong to a certain hyper-

surface hσ, then the total electric charge inside Ω3 is

Q =

ρ dx1dx2dx3 ,

ZΩ3⊂hσ

(6)

with ρ as the electric charge density. The total charge in space, which we ﬁnd
hσ, is globally
by integration over the whole of space, i.e., by letting Ω3 →
conserved. Therefore the integral in (6) over each hypersurface hσ1, hσ2, . . .
keeps the same value.

The local conservation of charge, see Fig.3, translates into the following
fact: If a number of worldlines of particles with one elementary charge enter a
prescribed but arbitrary 4-dimensional volume Ω4, then, in classical physics,
the same number has to leave the volume. If we count the entering worldlines
as negative and the leaving ones as positive (in conformity with the direction
of their normal vectors), then the (3-dimensional) surface integral over the
number of worldlines has to vanish.

Now, the natural extensive quantities to be integrated over a 3-dimen-
sional hypersurface are vector densities, see the appendix. Accordingly, in
i with 4 independent compo-
nature there should exist a 4-vector density
nents which measures the charge piercing through an arbitrary 3-dimensional
hypersurface. Therefore, it generalizes in a consistent 4-dimensional formal-
ism the familiar concepts of charge density ρ and current density ja. The
axiom of local charge conservation then reads

i d3Si = 0 ,

(7)

where the integral is taken over the (3-dimensional) boundary of an arbitrary
4-dimensional volume of spacetime, with d3Si being the 3-surface element,
as deﬁned in the appendix.

nates.

of decomposed quantities that are longitudinal and transversal to the corre-
sponding normal vector n. The 4-vector density

5 Force and ﬁeld strengths (axiom 2)

By now we have exhausted the information contained in the axiom 1 of
charge conservation. We have to introduce new concepts in order to com-
plete the fundamental structure of Maxwell’s theory. Whereas the excita-

tion
and magnetic ﬁeld strengths are usually introduced as forces acting on unit
charges at rest or in motion, respectively. In the purely electric case with a

strength is found, i.e., Fij depends on 6 independent components. We know
the notion of force from mechanics, the current density we know from axiom
1. Accordingly, axiom 2 is to be understood as an operational deﬁnition of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength Fij.

With the decomposition

Fij = ⊥Fij + F ij ,

we ﬁnd the identiﬁcations for the electric ﬁeld strength Ea and the magnetic

6 Conservation of magnetic ﬂux (axiom 3)

Axiom 2 on the Lorentz force gave us a new quantity, the electromagnetic
ﬁeld strength with the dimension [F ] = action/charge = ¯h/q =: φ, with
time SI= V s = Wb. Here Wb is the

c] = [Fab] = φ/l2 SI= Wb/m2 = T (for
[Ea] = [Fa0] = φ/(t l) SI= V /m and [
B
Tesla).

time/charge = voltage

×

We are in need of an experimentally established law that relates to F . And
we would prefer, as in the case of the electric charge, to recur to a counting
procedure. What else can we count in relation to the electromagnetic ﬁeld?
Certainly magnetic ﬂux lines in the interior of a type II superconductor which
is exposed to a suﬃciently strong magnetic ﬁeld. And these ﬂux lines are
quantized. In fact, they can order in a 2-dimensional triangular Abrikosov
lattice, see Fig.4. These ﬂux lines carry a unit of magnetic ﬂux, a so-called
10−15 Wb , see Tinkham
ﬂux quantum or ﬂuxon with Φ0 = h/(2e) = 2.07
[17]; here h is the Planck constant and e the elementary charge. These ﬂux
lines can move, via its surface, in or out of the superconductor, but they
cannot vanish (unless two lines with diﬀerent sign collide) or spontaneously
come into existence. In other words, there is a strong experimental evidence
that magnetic ﬂux is a conserved quantity.

×

The number 2 in the relation Φ0 = h/(2e) is due to the fact that the
Cooper pairs in a superconductor consist of 2 electrons. Moreover, outside a
superconductor the magnetic ﬂux is not quantized, i.e., we cannot count the
ﬂux lines there with the same ease that we could use inside. Nevertheless,
as we shall see, experiments clearly show that the magnetic ﬂux is conserved
also there.

a is the magnetic ﬁeld strength and d2Sa the spatial 2-surface

deﬁnition (6) of the charge. Here, in (28), we integrate only over 2 dimensions
rather than over 3 dimensions, as in the case of the charge in (6). Thus in
a spacetime picture in which one space dimension is suppressed, see Fig.5,
our magnetic ﬂux integral looks like an integral over a ﬁnite interval [A, B]
embedded into the hypersurface hσ1.

Now we are going to argue again as in Sec.3.

integrate over an inﬁnite spatial 2-surface (A

total magnetic ﬂux at time σ1 is given by (28). If we propagate that interval
into the (coordinate) future, see the interval on the hypersurface hσ2, then
magnetic ﬂux conservation requires the constancy of the integral Φ. In other
words, if we orient the integration domain suitably, the loop integral, the

leak out along the dotted “vertical” domains at spatial inﬁnity.

Analogously as we did in the case of charge conservation, we want to
formulate a corresponding local conservation law in an explicitly covariant
way. We saw that the global conservation of magnetic ﬂux is expressed as
over the particular 2-dimensional loop in
the vanishing of the integral of

Figure 6: Conservation of magnetic ﬂux in spacetime: Consider the arbi-
trary 3-dimensional integration domain Ω3. The integral vanishes of the
ﬁeld strength Fij over the 2-dimensional boundary ∂Ω3 of the 3-dimensional
domain Ω3. The analogous is true for the ﬂux integral over ∂ ˜Ω3.

and, since the volume is arbitrary, we have the local version of magnetic ﬂux
conservation as

∂[iFjk] = 0.

We substitute the decomposition (23) into (31). Then we ﬁnd the homo-

Thus both, the sourcelessness of

veriﬁed and, in turn, strongly support the axiom of the conservation of the
magnetic ﬂux.

B

The recognition that Maxwell’s theory, besides on charge conservation, is
based on magnetic ﬂux conservation, sheds new light on the possible existence
of magnetic monopoles. First of all, careful search for them has not lead to

(31)

(32)

(33)

any signature of their possible existence, see [6]. Furthermore, magnetic ﬂux
conservation would be violated if we postulated the existence of a current
on the right hand side of (31). Now, Eq.(9) is the analog of (31), at least
in our axiomatic set-up. Why should we believe in charge conservation any
longer if we gave up magnetic ﬂux conservation? Accordingly, we assume –
in contrast to most elementary particle physicists, see Cheng & Li [3] – that
in Maxwell’s theory proper there is no place for a magnetic current4 on the
right hand side of (31).

7 Constitutive law (axiom 4)

The Maxwell equations (14) and (31) or, in the decomposed version, (19) and
(33), respectively, encompass altogether 6 partial diﬀerential equations with
a ﬁrst order time derivative (the 2 remaining equations can be understood as
constraints to the initial conﬁguration). Since excitations and ﬁeld strengths
add up to 6+6 = 12 independent components, certainly the Maxwellian set is
underdetermined with respect to the time propagation of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. What we clearly need is a relation between the excitations and the
ﬁeld strengths. As we will see, these so-called constitutive equations require
additional knowledge about the properties of spacetime whereas the Maxwell
equations, as derived so far, are of universal validity as long as classical
physics is a valid approximation. In particular, in the Riemannian space of
Einstein’s gravitational theory the Maxwell equations look just the same as
in (14) and (31). There is no adaptation needed of any kind, see [11].

If we investigate macroscopic matter, one has to derive from the micro-
scopic Maxwell equations by statistical procedures the macroscopic Maxwell
equations. They are expected to have the same structure as the microscopic
ones. But let us stay, for the time being, on the microscopic level.

Then we can make an attempt with a linear constitutive relation between

ij and Fkl,

with the tensor density χijkl that is characteristic for the spacetime under
consideration. We require [χ] = 1, i.e., for the dimensionfull scalar factor fac-
tor f we have [f ] = q/φ = q2/h SI= C/(V s) = A/V = 1/Ω. The dimensionless

ij and Fkl, obeys

Moreover, if we assume the existence of a Lagrangian density for the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld

ijFij, then we have additionally the symmetries

L ∼ H

χijkl = χklij ,

χ[ijkl] = 0 .

The vanishing of the totally antisymmetric part comes about since the cor-
responding Euler-Lagrange derivative of
with respect to the 4-potential
Ai identically vanishes; here Fij = 2∂[iAj]. For χijkl, this leaves 20 indepen-
dent components5. One can take such moduli, if applied on a macrophysical
scale, for describing the electromagnetic properties of anisotropic crystals,
e.g.. Then also non-linear (for ferromagnetism) and spatially non-local con-
stitutive laws are in use.

L

The simplest linear law is expected to be valid in vacuum. Classically, the
vacuum of spacetime is described by its metric tensor gij = gji that deter-
mines the temporal and spatial distances of neighboring events. Considering
the symmetry properties of the density χijkl, the only ansatz possible, up to
an arbitrary constant, seems to be

χijkl =

det gmn

gikgjl

gjkgil

.

(37)

Note that χijkl is invariant under a rescaling of the metric gij
Ω2gij, with
an arbitrary function Ω(xi). Using this freedom, we can always normalize
the determinant of the metric to 1.

A Four-dimensional calculus without metric

and integrals

In a 4-dimensional space, in which arbitrary coordinates xi are used, with
i = 0, 1, 2, 3, one can deﬁne derivatives and integrals of suitable antisym-
metric covariant tensors and antisymmetric contravariant tensor densities
without the need of a metric. The tensors are used for representing inten-
sive quantities (how strong?), the tensor densities for extensive (additive)
quantities (how much?). The natural formalism for deﬁning integrals in a
coordinate invariant way is exterior calculus, see Frankel [5]. However, we
will use here tensor calculus, see Schouten [14] and also Schr¨odinger [15],
which is more widely known under physicists and engineers.

Integration over 4-dimensional regions – scalar densities

Consider a certain 4-dimensional region Ω4. Then a integral over Ω4 is of

the form

d4S ,

ZΩ4 A

where d4S := dx0dx1dx2dx3 is the 4-volume element which is a scalar density
1. We want this integral to be a scalar, i.e., that its value does
of weight
not depend on the particular coordinates we use. Then the integrand
has
to be a scalar density of weight +1. In other words, when using the tensor
formalism, the natural quantity required to formulate an invariant integral
over a 4-dimensional region is a scalar density of weight +1.

Integration over 3-dimensional regions – vector densities

Now we want to deﬁne invariant integrals over some 3-dimensional hyper-
surface Ω3 in a four-dimensional space which can be deﬁned by the parame-
terization xi = xi(ya), a, b, c = 1, 2, 3, where ya are also arbitrary coordinates

the 3-surface element on Ω3. This quantity is constructed by using only
objects that can be deﬁned in a general 4-dimensional space without metric or
connection. It can be constructed as soon as we specify the parameterization
of Ω3. Here ǫijkl is the 4-dimensional Levi-Civita tensor density of weight

and ǫabc the 3-dimensional Levi-Civita tensor density of weight +1 on Ω3.
Furthermore, this hypersurface element turns out to be a covector density of
1 with respect to 4-dimensional coordinate transformation. With
weight
this integration element to our disposal, the natural form of an invariant
integral over Ω3 is

Therefore, the natural object to be integrated over Ω3 in order to obtain an
invariant result is a vector density of weight +1.

Integration over 2-dimensional regions – covariant tensors or con-
travariant tensor densities

Analogously, we can parameterize a 2-dimensional region Ω2 by means of
xi = xi(zα), α, β = 1, 2, where zα are arbitrary coordinates on Ω2. Then we
can immediately construct the following 2-surface element

d2Sij :=

∂xk
∂zα
where ǫαβ is the Levi-Civita density of weight +1 on Ω2. This surface element
is an antisymmetric second order covariant tensor density of weight

B Decomposition of totally antisymmetric ten-
sors into longitudinal and transversal pieces

Here we provide the decomposition formulas for totally antisymmetric co-
variant and contravariant tensors, which are the natural generalization of
the decomposition of vectors and covectors.

We start by considering an antisymmetric covariant tensor of rank p,

namely Ui1...ip. Its longitudinal and transversal components are given by

⊥Ui1...ip = p Lm

[i1|Um|i2...ip] ,

U i1...ip = (p + 1)Lm

[mUi1...ip] ,

(49)

where ki := ∂iσ, and Li

j := nikj. They fulﬁll the following properties:

ni1U i1...ip = 0 ,

ni1 ⊥Ui1...ip = ni1Ui1...ip .

(50)

For p = 1, 2, 3, 4 we can explicitly write:

Now we turn to V i1...ip, an antisymmetric contravariant tensors of rank p.
We deﬁne the decomposition as

⊥V i1...ip = p L[i1|

mV m|i2...ip] ,

V i1...ip = (p + 1)L[m

mV i1...ip] .

They fulﬁll

ki1V i1...ip = 0 ,

ki1

⊥V i1...ip = ki1V i1...ip .

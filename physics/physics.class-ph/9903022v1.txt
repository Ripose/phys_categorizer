Abstract

The width
△L of the ﬁrst Bragg’s scattering peak in the (111) direction of a
face-centered-cubic lattice of air spheres can be well approximated by a sim-
ple formula which only involves the volume averaged ε and ε2 over the lattice
unit cell, ε being the (position dependent) dielectric constant of the medium,
and the eﬀective dielectric constant εeff in the long-wavelength limit approx-
imated by Maxwell-Garnett’s formula. Apparently, our formula describes the
asymptotic behaviour of the absolute gap width
△L for high dielectric con-
trast δ exactly. The standard deviation σ steadily decreases well below 1%
as δ increases. For example σ < 0.1% for the sphere ﬁlling fraction f = 0.2
(1, 100), our formula still approximates the

cision, namely with a standard deviation 3% (4.2%) for low ﬁlling fractions

air spheres in a dielectric and dielectric spheres in air are brieﬂy discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

The propagation of light in a periodic dielectric medium has recently attracted much
attention due to the possibility of opening a gap in the spectrum of electromagnetic waves
for both polarizations and all directions of the incident waves [1–5].
In such a medium,
the density of states (DOS) can be, in a certain frequency interval, either reduced down
to zero (photonic band gap) or enhanced with respect to the vacuum case. The changes
in the DOS aﬀect various physical quantities. The most transparent is the change in the
spontaneous emission rate of embedded atoms and molecules which may have applications
for semiconductor lasers, solar cells, heterojunction bipolar transistors, and thresholdless
lasers [1] or to create new sources of light for ultra-fast optical communication systems.

A full photonic band gap has so far been observed only at microwaves [5]. One of the
most promising candidates to achieve such a gap at optical and near-infrared frequencies
are collodial systems of microspheres, since they can self-assemble into three-dimensional
crystals with excellent long-range periodicity [6–10]. This long-range periodicity gives rise
to strong optical Bragg’s scattering clearly visible by the naked eye and already described
in 1963 [11]. Monodisperse collodial suspensions of microspheres crystalize either in a face-
centered-cubic (fcc) [8,12,13] or (for small sphere ﬁlling fraction) in a body-centered-cubic
(bcc) lattice [9]. Using suspensions of microspheres of diﬀerent sizes one can also prepare
crystals with a complex unit cell (containing more than one scatterer). Both the case of
“dense spheres” [13] and “air spheres” [14] when the dielectric constant of spheres εs is
greater and smaller than the dielectric constant εb of the background medium, respectively,
can be realized experimentally. There is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two cases,
since, according to numerical calculations, simple dielectric lattices of homogeneous spheres
[15–17] in air do not exhibit a full photonic band gap, while for air spheres a full band
gap can open for a simple fcc lattice [15–17]. Unfortunately, the required dielectric contrast
δ = max(εs/εb, εb/εs) for opening the full band gap, either 8.4 obtained using the plane wave
method [16], or, 8.13 obtained by the photonic analoque of the Korringa-Kohn-Rostocker
(KKR) method [17,18], is currently out of experimental reach at optical and near-infrared
frequencies. The absence of a full gap in this frequency range in currently available collodial
crystals of homogeneous and single size spheres does not mean the absence of interesting
physics in this weak photonic region. For example, the change in the spontaneous emission
rate of dye molecules in an fcc collodial crystal can be observed already at a relatively low
δ

1.2 [19].
In contrast to the full gap, Bragg’s reﬂection can be observed for arbitrarily small δ as
long as a sample has suﬃcient long-range periodicity. Analysis of Bragg’s scattering might
not only be useful to understand the physics of photonic crystals, but it has already found
practical application in distributed feedback lasers in the visible region of the spectrum [20].
The ﬁrst Bragg’s peak can be characterized by the width of the (lowest) stop gap (gap at a
ﬁxed direction of the incident light) at a certain point on the boundary of the Brillouin zone.
We focus here on the case of a simple fcc lattice of air spheres [14], which is among the most
promising candidates to achieve a full photonic band gap. For an fcc lattice, it is convenient
to consider Bragg’s scattering in the (111) direction which corresponds to the L direction
of the Brillouin zone (see [23] for the classiﬁcation of special points of three-dimensional
lattices). Apart from numerous experimental data now available [8,12,13,24], there are at

≈

2

least two other reasons for this choice. First, the width of the ﬁrst stop gap takes on its
maximum at the L point and, second, experimental techniques make it possible to allow one
to grow collodial crystals such that the L direction corresponds to normal incidence on the
crystal surface.

Let ε(r) be the dielectric constant of an fcc photonic crystal. One has ε(r) = εs if r is
inside the sphere and ε(r) = εb otherwise. Let f be the sphere ﬁlling fraction, i.e., volume
of the sphere(s) in the unit cell per unit cell volume. Once f is ﬁxed, the spectrum is only
a function of the dielectric contrast δ. By a suitable rescaling, one can always set εs = 1 for
the case of “air” spheres (εb = 1 for the case of “dense” spheres). As δ and f are varied,
△L and the L-midgap frequency νc change. As a function

Obtaining exact analytic results for dielectric lattices turns out to be notoriously diﬃcult
and numerics has been the main tool to understand photonic gaps so far [3,4,15–17,21]. A
simple analytical formula, if any, may be a good starting point for obtaining a better insight
into the problem. It was rather surprising to ﬁnd out that such a formula can be found for
the L-gap width

III. DISCUSSION

Formulas (3) [together with (4)], (6), and (7) are the main results of this work. They ﬁt
nicely experimental data on Bragg’s scattering in fcc photonic crystals of air spheres [12–14].
Note that
△L also characterizes the transmission of light through such a crystal (see [24] for
microwaves). The fact that such simple relations can describe one of the photonic gaps has
been completely unexpected. Indeed, the numerical calculation of photonic band structures
is a great deal more involved than that in the case of scalar waves (including the case of
electrons) where no analog of formulas (3) and (7) is known. Numerics has been the main tool
to understand photonic gaps [3,4,15–17,21]. This is also the case of two recent discussions
of Bragg’s scattering in the (111) direction [29]. A previous attempt to understand Bragg’s
scattering in photonic crystals involved an introduction of a “photonic strength” parameter
Ψ = 3f α [13]. It was shown that the dynamical diﬀraction theory [30], which is well known
in x-ray diﬀraction, already fails to describe Bragg’s scattering in a photonic crystal for
Ψ

Formulas (3) and (7) immediately raise questions whether one can understand and derive
them analytically. The L-gap width for fcc structures is a natural measure to characterize

turns out that formulas (3) and (7) cannot be applied to the case of dense spheres. The sim-
ple fcc lattices of air and dense spheres have for the same dielectric contrast rather diﬀerent
behavior with respect to the full photonic band gap [15–17] and to the ﬁrst Bragg’s peak
r
[8,12–14]. Our numerical calculation shows that, for dense spheres,
L does not increase

monotonically with δ as in the case of air spheres. Instead
L ﬁrst reaches a local maximum,
then it returns to zero and only afterwards starts to increase monotonically [28]. This behav-

to understand what causes this diﬀerent behavior. The latter can be partially attributed
to the fact that, for a lattice of spheres, εb no longer describes the dielectric constant of
the surrounding medium, which is instead described by the eﬀective dielectric constant εeff .
Therefore, the bare dielectric contrast δ is renormalized to δeff = max(εs/εeff , εeff /εs), where
= εb. Given the bare dielectric contrast δ, one ﬁnds that the renormal-

ized dielectric contrast δd
eff = εs/εeff in the case of dense spheres is always smaller than the
renormalized dielectric contrast δa

to verify in the limit of very high bare dielectric contrast δ

To conclude we have found that, despite of the complexity of the problem of propagation
of electromagnetic waves in a periodic dielectric medium, the absolute and the relative
width of the ﬁrst Bragg’s peak in the (111) direction for an fcc lattice of air spheres can be
accurately described by the simple empirical formulas (3) and (7), respectively. Apparently,
for suﬃciently high δ
△L exactly.
Indeed, the relative error σr steadily decreases as one investigates region δ
δc for higher
and higher δc. For all ﬁlling fractions σr falls well below 1% if suﬃcciently high δ is taken.
20 one obtains σr < 0.1% for f = 0.2 and σr < 0.3% for f = 0.4.
For example for δ
For δ
△L with a reasonable precision, namely, with
the relative error ranging from 3.3% to 6.5% (depending on the ﬁlling fraction). The main
contribution to the error is picked up around δ = δm(f ) for which
△L takes on its maximum.
At δ = δm, our formula (3) gives persistently a slightly lower value for
△L. The relative
r
L-gap width
L is described by the formula (7) with a slightly larger relative error ranging
from 4.1% to 8% (depending on the ﬁlling fraction). The reason is that there are now two
main contributions to the error, that around the maximum of
△L and the second systematic
error due to the overestimation of the L-midgap frequency νc when using Eq. (6). All the
formulas only involve the eﬀective dielectric constant of the medium εeff approximated by
Maxwell-Garnett’s formula (2), and volume averaged ε(r) and ε2(r) over the lattice unit cell.
Since ε, ε2, and εeff have well-deﬁned meaning for any lattice, this suggests that a similar
gap behavior may occur for other lattices. It would be interesting to ﬁnd out if the same is
true for the width of the full photonic band gap [28].

FIG. 1. The L-gap width in units c/πA, where c is the speed of light in vacuum and A is a
length of the side of the conventional unit cell of the cubic lattice [25], for an fcc lattice of air
spheres with f = 0.4 calculated exactly (the solid line) and approximated by the formula (3) with
optimized C (the dashed line) and with C given by the formula (4) (the long-dashed line). The
last two curves almost overlap.

FIG. 2. The L-midgap frequency νc for air spheres in the units kL/(2πnM G

eff ), where kL is the
length of the Bloch vector at the L point and nM G
is the eﬀective refractive index of the medium
eff
calculated by Maxwell-Garnett’s formula (2). The dot-dashed line is for the sphere ﬁlling fraction
f = 0.1, the long-dashed line is for f = 0.2, the dashed line is for f = 0.4, ﬁnely dotted line is for
f = 0.6, and the solid line corresponds to the close-packed case (f = 0.74).

FIG. 3. The relative L-gap width (the L-gap width divided by the midgap frequency) for an fcc
lattice of air spheres shows a rather simple dependence on the refractive index contrast nb/ns = √δ.
The dot-dashed line is for the sphere ﬁlling fraction f = 0.1, the long-dashed line is for f = 0.2,
the dashed line is for f = 0.4, ﬁnely dotted line is for f = 0.6, and the solid line corresponds to
the close-packed case (f = 0.74).

and its approximation using the formula (7) with optimized R (long-dashed line). Once R is
optimized, ˜σr can be reduced to

We consider a particle represented by an anharmonic oscillator, coupled to an environment (a ﬁeld)
modeled by an ensemble of harmonic oscillators, the whole system being conﬁned in a cavity of
diameter L. Up to the ﬁrst perturbative order in the quartic interaction (interaction parameter λ),
we use the formalism of dressed states introduced in previous publications, to obtain for a large
cavity explicit λ-dependent formulas for the particle radiation process. These formulas are obtained
in terms of the corresponding exact expressions for the linear case. We conclude for the enhancement
of the particle decay induced by the quartic interaction.

I. INTRODUCTION

In previous publications [1–3], a non perturbative ap-
proach (dressed states) has been used to study systems
that can be described by a Hamiltonian of the form,

where the limit N
is understood, the subscript 0 refers
to a particle approximated by a harmonic oscillator hav-
ing bare frequency ω0, and k = 1, 2, ...N refer to the
harmonic ﬁeld modes. A Hamiltonian of the type of
Eq.(1.1), can be viewed as a linear coupling of an atom
with the scalar potential, and has been investigated in
[1,2] to deﬁne rigorous dressed states which allow a non-
perturbative approach to the time evolution of atomic
states. An Hamiltonian of the type (1.1) has also been
employed in [4] to study the quantum Brownian motion

limit N
we recover, within the framework of the
harmonic approximation, the situation of the linear cou-
pling of an atom with the scalar potential, or the coupling
of a Brownian particle with its environment, after redef-
inition of divergent quantities.
In the case of the cou-
pled atom ﬁeld system, the above mentioned formalism
of dressed states recovers the experimental observation
that excited states of atoms in suﬃciently small cavities
are stable. It allows to give formulas for the probability
of an atom to remain excited for an inﬁnitely long time,
provided it is placed in a cavity of appropriate size [2].

In this note we intend to generalize, making some ap-
propriate approximations, to an anharmonic oscillator,
the linear coupling to an environnement as it has been
considered in the above mentioned works. In this case,
the whole system is described by the Hamiltonian,

Eq.(1.1) and T (r)
µνρσ are some coeﬃcients that will be de-
ﬁned below. In Eq. (1.2) summation over repeated greek
labels is understood. We emphasize that our problem
is diﬀerent from the situation treated in the pioneering
papers of Refs [6,7]. We do not intend to go to higher
orders in the perturbative series for the energy eigen-
statates, we will remain at a ﬁrst order correction in λr,
and we will try to see what are the eﬀects of the anhar-
monicity term, given by the last term of Eq. (1.2), on
our previous results for the linear coupling with an en-
vironnement. We notice that the anharmonicity term in
Eq. (1.2) involves, independent quartic terms of the type
q4
(self-coupling of the bare oscillator and
µ , µ = 0,
of the ﬁeld modes), quartic terms coupling the oscillator
to the ﬁeld modes and also the terms coupling the ﬁeld
modes among themselves. These terms are of the type
q0q3
j , with n + m = 4,
for the coupling between the ﬁeld modes. We intend to
start from the exact solutions we have found in the linear
case, and investigate at ﬁrst order, how the quartic in-
teraction characteristic of the anharmonicity changes the
decay probabilities obtained in the linear case.

The bilinear Hamiltonian (1.1) can be turned to prin-
cipal axis by means of a point transformation, qµ =

0, ...N, performed by an orthonormal matrix T = (tr
µ).
The subscript µ = 0 refers to the atom (or the Brownian
particle) and µ = k , k = 1, 2, 3... refer to the harmonic
modes of the ﬁeld (or the thermal bath) The subscripts

In terms of normal mo-
menta and coordinates, the transformed Hamiltonian in

We take ck = η(ωk)n.

In this case the environment
is classiﬁed according to n > 1, n = 1, or n < 1,
respectively as supraohmic, ohmic or subohmic. For a
subohmic environment the sum in Eq.(2.3) is convergent
and the frequency ω0 is well deﬁned. For ohmic and
supraohmic environments the sum in the right hand side
of Eq.(2.3) diverges what makes the equation meaningless
as it stands, a renormalization procedure being needed.
We restrict ourselves to ohmic systems.
In this case,
using the method described in [1] we can deﬁne a renor-
malized frequency ¯ω, by means of a counterterm δω2,

¯ω2 = ω2

δω2 = N η2,

We see that in the limit N
the above procedure is
exactly the analogous of naive mass renormalization in
Quantum Field Theory: the addition of a counterterm
0 allows to compensate the inﬁnuty of ω2
0 in such
−
a way as to leave a ﬁnite, physically meaninful renormal-
ized frequency ¯ω. This simple renormalization scheme
has been originally introduced in ref. [5].

δω2q2

To proceed, we take the constant η as η = √2g∆ω,
∆ω being the interval between two neighbouring bath
frequencies (supposed uniform) and where g is some con-
stant (with dimension of f requency). We restrict ou-
selves to the physical situations in which the whole sys-
tem is conﬁned to a cavity of diameter L, in which case
the environment (ﬁeld) frequencies ωk can be writen in
the form

ωk = 2kπ/L,

k = 1, 2, ... .

The solutions of Eq.(2.8) with respect to Ω give the spec-

turning the system to principal axis are obtained in terms
of the physically meaningful quantities Ωr, ¯ω, after some
rather long but straightforward manipulations analogous
as it has been done in [1]. They read,

From Eq.(2.15) we see that the initially excited dressed
oscillator naturally distributes its energy among itself
and all other dressed oscillators (the atom and the en-
vironment) as time goes on, with probability amplitudes
given by the quantities fµν(t) in Eq.(2.16). For µ = 0 in
Eq.(2.15) the coeﬃcients f 0ν(t) have a simple interpre-
tation: f 00(t) and f 0i(t) are respectively the probability
amplitudes that at time t the dressed particle still be ex-
cited or have radiated a quantum of frequency ¯hωi. We
see that this formalism allows a quite natural description
of the radiation process as a simple exact time evolu-
tion of the system.
In the case of a very large cavity
(free space) our method reproduces for weak coupling
the well-known perturbative results [1,2].

which replaced in Eq. (3.1) and using the orthonormality
of the matrix tr
µ gives the Hamiltonian in principal axis,

Performing a perturbative calculation in λ, we can ob-

For suﬃciently small λ we will have quasi-harmonic
normal collective modes having frequencies Ωr + λre(1)
r .
Accordingly we can describe approximatelly the system
in terms of moﬁﬁed harmonic eigenstates, which can be
written as a generalization of the exact eigenstates (2.10),
replacing the eigenfrequencies Ωr by the λ-corrected val-
ues Ωr + λre(1)

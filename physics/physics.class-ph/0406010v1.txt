ON THE ELECTRODYNAMICS WITH FASTER-THAN-LIGHT
MOTION

Gennadii A. Kotel’nikov
RRC Kurchatov Institute, Moscow, 123182, Russia

The version of electrodynamics is constructed in which faster-than-light motions of ﬁelds
and particles with real masses are possible.

1. Introduction

For certainty, by faster-than-light motions we will understand the motions with
1010 cm/sec. The existence of such motions is the question discussed
velocities v > 3
in modern physics. In spite of the well-known conservatism, in the world science
considerable attention is given to this question.

·

Blokhintsev (1946-1947) [1] paid attention to the possibility of formulating the
ﬁeld theory that permits the propagation of faster-than-light (superluminal) inter-
actions outside the light cone. Later (1952) [2] he also noted the possibility of the
existence of superluminal solutions in the nonlinear equations of electrodynamics.
Kirzhnits (1954) [3] showed that a particle possessing the tensor of mass M i
k =
) can move with the

diag(m0, m1, m1, m1), i, k = 0, 1, 2, 3, gab = diag(+,
faster-than-light velocity v = cm0/m1 > c if m0 > m1.

,

Terletsky (1960) [4] introduced into theoretical physics the particles with imag-

inary rest masses moving faster than light.

Feinberg (1967) [5] named these particles tachyons and described their main

properties.

Research on the superluminal tachyon motions opened up additional opportu-
nities which were studied by many authors, for example by Bilaniuk and Sudar-
shan [6], Recami [7], Mignani [8], Kirzhnits and Sazonov [9], Corben [10], Patty
[11], Recami, Fontana and Caravaglia [12]. It has led to original scientiﬁc direction

(hundreds publications). The tachyon movements may formally be described by
SR expanded to the area of motions where s2 < 0. For comparison, the standard
theory describes motions on the zero cone s2 = 0 at v = c and in the area s2 > 0
when v < c.

The publications are also known in which the violation of invariance of the
speed of light is considered [13] - [19]. We can note, for example, the Pauli’s mono-
graph [13] where the elements of Ritz and Abraham theories are contained; the
Logunov’s ”Lections on Fundamentals of Relativity Theory” [14]; the Glashow’s
paper [15] discussing the experimental consequences of violation of the Lorentz-
invariance in astrophysics; publications [16] - [19] on the violation of invariance of
the velocity of light in SR.

Below a version of the theory permitting faster-than-light motions of electromag-
netic ﬁelds and charged particles with real masses is proposed as the continuation
of such investigations.

2. Space-Time Metric. Transformation Law of Coordinates

Let us start from the condition of invariance of the inﬁnitesimal space-time
interval of 4-space R4, the metric properties of which may depend on the velocity
of a particle being investigated. Supposing that space is homogeneous and isotropic
we take the metric in the form:

ds2 = (c0

Here x, y, z are the spatial coordinates, t is the time, c0, c′
0 are the proper values of
the speed of light, v is the velocity of a particle with respect to the reference frame
K. Let us connect the co-moving frame K ′ with this particle. Let the proper speed
of light be invariant

In this case, as follows from (1), the common time t′

agree to name the value 3
velocity of light. In accordance with the hypothesis of homogeneity and isotropy of
the space-time, the velocity v of a free particle does not depend on t and x. The
velocity of light (4) is a constant value in this case. By substituting

ds = √1

We restrict ourselves by studying a variant of the theory in which the velocity of light
c = c(x0),
in the range of interactions may only depend on the time t, i.e. c = c(t)
where the relationship between x0 and t may be deduced from the solution of Eq.
(5). Then

3. As distinct from SR, the ”time” x0 = ct in the present work is a function of
the time t only for the case of a free particle. In the range of interaction the velocity
of light depends on time t. The value x0 becomes the functional (5) of the function
c(t) and takes into consideration the history of moving the particle.

β = V (t)/c0(1 + v2(t)/c0

4. The group parameter β = V /c of the matrix (8) may be constant not only
at the constant velocity of light, but also at c = c(t). Indeed we may accept that

Formally they are common both for SR theory [20] and for the present work. The
expression (34) may be also written in the form ρ′/c′ = ρ/c. Using the method
of replacement of variables, the transformational properties of electromagnetic ﬁeld
can be applied to prove the invariance of Maxwell equations (26) with respect to
space-time transformations (11).

6. Energy and Faster-than-Light Motion

Let us begin with the expression v = √
E

It follows
from here that in the framework of the present work a particle will move at the
faster-than-light velocity, if the particle energy satisﬁes the condition:

4/m0c0 > c0.

723 keV for the electron (

1330 Mev for the proton and neutron (

(
E0 = m0c0
E0 ∼
510 keV) and
938 MeV). From here
we may conclude that in the present work the neutron physics of nuclear reactors
may be formulated in the approximation v < c0 as in SR. The electrons with the
> 723 keV would be faster-than-light particles (for example, the velocity
energy
of the 1 GeV electron would be
2000 c0); the particle physics on accelerators
with the energy of protons more than 1.33 GeV would be the physics of faster-
than-light motions if the present theory were realized in the ﬁeld of validity of SR.
The examples of using the space-time transformations (11) for the interpretation of
Michelson, Fizeau and some other experiments, as well as for the interpretation of
aberration of light and of Doppler eﬀect, decay of unstable particles and creation
new particles, faster-than-light motion of nuclear reaction products are given in [17].

7. Conclusion

The L6X

△1 invariant theory has been constructed, where L6 is the Lorentz
△1 is the scale transformation group of the velocity of light c′ = γc. The

group,
ﬁeld of application of the theory is yet unknown in the present time. Nevertheless in

80 Gennadii A. Kotel’nikov

according with the Blokhintsev papers [1] we may assume that the proposed theory
will prove to be useful in the ﬁeld of quantum physics of dimensional particles,
where the property of elementary nature should not contradict to the existence of
internal structure of the particle. Indeed, the elementary particles should be points
in the L6 invariant theory (SR) because of a ﬁniteness of the speed of light c0. In the
L6X
△1 invariant theory this requirement is not necessary because of the absence
of the limit to the velocity of light c. The postulation c′ = c leads to SR.

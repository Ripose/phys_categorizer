On Two Complementary Types of Directional Derivative and Flow Field
Specification in Classical Field Theory

(Dated: March 18, 2011)

We discuss a general deﬁnition of directional derivative of any tensor ﬂow ﬁeld and its practical
applications in physics.
It is shown that both Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions as comple-
mentary types of ﬂow ﬁeld speciﬁcations adopted in modern theoretical hydrodynamics, imply two
complementary types of directional derivatives as corresponding mathematical constructions. One
of them is the Euler substantive derivative useful only in the context of initial Cauchy problem and
the other, called here as the local directional derivative, arises only in the context of so-called ﬁnal
Cauchy problem. The choice between Lagrangian and Eulerian speciﬁcations is demonstrated to be
equivalent to the choice between space-time with Euclidean and Minkowski metric for any ﬂow ﬁeld
domain, respectively. Mathematical consideration is developed within the framework of congruen-
cies for general 4-dimensional diﬀerentiable manifold. The analytical expression for local directional
derivative is formulated in form of a theorem. Although the consideration is developed for one-
component (scalar) ﬂow ﬁeld, it can be easily generalized to any tensor ﬁeld. Some implications of
the local directional derivative concept for the classical theory of ﬁelds are also explored.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Physical background and motivation for Euler’s math-
ematical construction known as substantive (or material)
derivative becomes manifest in the way how the whole
ﬂow ﬁeld may be speciﬁed in hydrodynamics. Usually,
two complementary types of speciﬁcations (or representa-
tions) are thought to suﬃce in order to provide a general
description of the ﬂow ﬁeld kinematics. The ﬁrst, La-
grangian speciﬁcation is based on identifying individual
elements or bits of ﬂuid domain. This idea associates a
ﬂuid motion with a geometrical transformation Ht on the
closure ¯Ω0 such that the set Ht ¯Ω0 represents the same in-
dividual bit of ﬂuid at time t. This representation is valid
only if the identiﬁcation can be maintained by some kind
of labelling usually denoting the initial position at instant
t0. The second, Eulerian speciﬁcation was conceived as
dissociated from identiﬁcation of individual bits of ﬂuid,
only making use of the ﬂow quantities as functions of lo-
cal position in space at each instant of time during the
motion. This speciﬁcation results especially useful for hy-
drodynamics of liquids and electromagnetic ﬁeld descrip-
tion in which any attempt of Lagrangian identiﬁcation is
impossible. Thus, in Euler’s approach the velocity vector
ﬁeld is a primary notion. Assigning a velocity vector to
each point of the ﬂuid domain, one obtains the system
of ordinary diﬀerential equations and their solutions as
integral curves, intimately related to the given velocity
vector ﬁeld. The Eulerian representation provides a time
parameterization of the curve in local coordinate system
as a diﬀerentiable mapping from an open set of R1 into
R3.

Both complementary types of speciﬁcations (Eulerian
and Lagrangian), generally speaking, diﬀerent and cer-
tainly useful in complementary contexts, can be made
mathematically equivalent under special conditions. In
terms of modern notation, they result equivalent within
the formulation of the initial Cauchy problem for an or-

dinary diﬀerential equation for velocity ﬁeld. It gives a
kind of dictionary for translating from one speciﬁcation
to the other.

In this respect it is interesting to note that from the
very birth of theoretical hydrodynamics as an indepen-
dent body of mathematical knowledge, the conventional
formulation of the directional derivative of ﬂow ﬁeld
quantities tacitly implies the equivalence with the La-
grangian speciﬁcation related to the initial Cauchy prob-
lem. Thus, according to this type of speciﬁcation, Euler’s
substantial (or material) derivative Df
Dt describes the rate
of time variation of f -property of ﬂuid element on its path
from one to the other point of space. As Euler himself
coined it two and a half centuries ago [1], his mathemat-
ical construction described the rate of time variation of
material properties f ollowing the motion of the f luid.
On the other hand, the conventional deﬁnition of the
Lie derivative on general diﬀerentiable manifolds, also ad-
mits the same interpretation related to the initial Cauchy
problem within the framework of congruencies for a given
parameterization {λi}. When comparing scalars, vectors
or tensors at diﬀerent points {λi} and {λi + ∆λi} on a
certain integral curve, those entities under comparison
are Lie (or invariably) dragged back from {λi + ∆λi} to
the point {λi}. This gives a unique diﬀerence and hence
a unique derivative as the limit of the diﬀerence between
the values of scalars, vectors or tensors at diﬀerent points
on a manifold. A notion of a Lie invariably dragged func-
tion along a congruence λi is essential in the conventional
deﬁnition of the directional (or Lie’s) derivative d
dλi along
a ﬂow (or general vector) ﬁeld. It deﬁnes the rule neces-
sary to compare values of a given mathematical entity at
two diﬀerent points.

The diﬀerential operator d

dλi is a tangent vector to the
curve r(λi) on a manifold. This association of the concept
of a directional derivative from the classical analysis al-
lows to maintain a visual picture on the Lie derivative as
a tangent vector that generates a kind of a motion along

the curve r(λi). In fact, when a diﬀerentiable manifold
is an ordinary Euclidean domain both Euler’s and Lie’s
derivatives coincide.

As we shall discuss in this paper, both Eulerian and
Lagrangian complementary ﬂow ﬁeld speciﬁcations which
are traditionally related to the initial Cauchy problem do
not cover all possible situations. It motivates a deﬁnition
of complementary mathematical object denoted here as a
local directional derivative. As a counter-part of the con-
ventional approach, it appears in this paper formulated
within the so-called ﬁnal Cauchy problem and describes
the time variation of f -property at some ﬁxed point in
a local coordinate system. It allows the Euler descrip-
tion of the ﬂow ﬁeld to be dissociated from any need of
identiﬁcation of individual bits of ﬂuid and, hence, to
be considered properly as function of a position at every
instant of time.

II. EULER’S DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVE
AND INITIAL CAUCHY PROBLEM

As the ﬁrst task, let us explore the relationship be-
tween the Eulerian and Lagrangian speciﬁcations within
the conventional deﬁnition of the directional derivative.
To simplify our analysis, the further discussion will be
based on the consideration of one-component (scalar)
ﬂuid moving in a three-dimensional Euclidean domain.
We denote by f (r, t) some regular function in an ar-
bitrary space-time coordinate system. For instance, in
ﬂuid dynamics or elasticity theory it could be a density
of some physical medium ρ in Cartesian coordinates.

If in Lagrangian speciﬁcation a geometrical transfor-
mation Ht represents a mapping of the closure ¯Ω0 onto
Ht ¯Ω0 for the same individual bit of ﬂuid at time t, then
Ht also represents the function [2]:

r = Htr0 = r(r0, t)

(2.1)

where points r and r0 denote the position-vector of the
ﬂuid identiﬁable point-particle at time t and initial time
t0, respectively. Thus, the velocity vector ﬁeld on the
domain is deﬁned as:

where r0 is ﬁxed.

In the context of Eulerian speciﬁcation, there is no
explicit consideration of the function r = r(r0, t). The
primary notion is the velocity ﬁeld

v =

r(r0, t)

∂
∂t

dr
dt

= v(r, t)

(2.2)

(2.3)

2

speciﬁcations become mathematically equivalent when
an initial condition r0 = r(t0) for Cauchy problem is
added to the ordinary diﬀerential equation (2.3). It gives
a rule for translating from one speciﬁcation to the other.
If any quantity has the Eulerian representation f (r, t),
its Lagrangian representation is [2]:

g(r0, t) = f (r(r0, t), t)

(2.4)

and, therefore, Euler’s material or substantive derivative
is conventionally deﬁned as [2]:

Df
Dt

∂
∂t

∂
∂t

= (

+ (v, ∇))f =

g(r0, t)

(2.5)

where r0 is ﬁxed.

The diﬀerential operator Df

Dt has meaning only when
applied to ﬂow ﬁeld variables as functions of (r(t), t) and
gives the deﬁnition of directional derivative as a time
derivative f ollowing the motion of the f luid in the di-
rection of its velocity ﬁeld v:

D
Dt

f (r(t), t) = lim
t→0

1
t

[f (r(t0 + t), t0 + t) − f (r(t0), t0)]

(2.6)
Here, according to the standard deﬁnition (2.5) related
to the initial Cauchy problem r(t0) = r0, both values
f0 = f (r(t0), t0) and f = f (r(t0 + t), t0 + t) represent
the f -property at two diﬀerent points of space r0 and
r0 + ∆r, respectively.

Thus, in this type of Eulerian of speciﬁcation, one can
reconstruct the property f of any identiﬁed bit of ﬂuid
at a new position r(t0 + dt) = r0 + dr and instant t0 + dt,
based only on the knowledge of partial time derivative ∂f
∂t
and local distributions of the gradient ∇f and velocity
ﬁeld v in local coordinate system:

f = f0 + (

+ (v, ∇f )dt

(2.7)

∂f
∂t

The function f has, generally speaking, explicit as well
as implicit (through r(t)) time dependencies and, there-
fore, may be deﬁned on a 4-dimensional space-time man-
ifold with no metric known a priori.
In this respect,
the Lie derivative, as a particularly interesting general-
ization of (2.5) (or (2.6)), will be convenient for further
considerations, since it provides a necessary framework
on manifolds without metric. The diﬀerential equation
(2.3) will deﬁne a congruence or t-parameterized set of
integral world-lines ﬁlling a 4-dimensional manifold:

dxi
dt

= V i;

xi(t) = xi

0+

V idt

(2.8)

t0+t

Z
t0

as function of position in space (r) and time (t) on a ﬂuid
domain. Based on this convention, it is clear that both

where x = (x0, x1, x2, x3) = (t, r); V = (1, v); x0 = x(t0)
and, for our convenience, we leave for the time variable x0

its original denomination t. Upper indices are used for
the coordinate functions xi(t) so that the 1-forms will
satisfy the index conventions of modern diﬀerential ge-
ometry.

If the velocity vector ﬁeld V is C∞, the coordinate
transformation (2.8) is a diﬀeomorphism, forming part
of a one-parameter Lie group. Let us denote this trans-
formation as Ft:
(x0 → x(x0, t)), which deﬁnes the
mapping of f (x0) = f (t0, r(t0)) along the congruence
(called also as Lie dragging [3]) into a new function
f (x0 + x) = f (t0 + t, r(t0 + t)). A Lie dragging of
scalar ﬁeld has a simple geometrical interpretation in La-
grangian speciﬁcation of the ﬂuid ﬁeld: Ft transforms the
f -property of the identiﬁed ﬂuid element at x0 according
the rule [5]:

(Ftf )(x0) = f (Ft(x0)) = f (x0 + x)

(2.9)

into the f -property of the same ﬂuid element at x0 + x.
This interpretation also concerns the analytic expression
of the Lie derivative LV along the vector ﬁeld V = (1, v):

LV f = [

Ft f ]t0 = lim
t→0

d
dt

1
t

[f (x0 + x) − f (x0)]

(2.10)

where x(t0) = 0. The concept of a Lie invariably dragged
function along a congruence is used in this conventional
deﬁnition (and implicitly in (2.6)): in fact, the quantity
f (x0 +x) is invariably dragged along the congruence from
x0+x back to x0, since in general tensor calculus it has no
clear meaning to compare both values f (x0) and f (x0+x)
at diﬀerent points in a manifold without metric. Thus,
(2.10) gives a unique diﬀerence and therefore a unique
derivative. In fact, when t is too small, the mapping Ft:
(x0 → x(x0, t)) has an explicit form:

Ftx0 = xi(x0, t) = xi

0 + tV i(x0) + o(t)

(2.11)

which gives analytic expression for the Lie derivative:

LV f =

d
dt

f (Ft x0) = V i ∂f
∂xi

(2.12)

Important that both traditional deﬁnitions for Euler’s
and Lie’s directional derivatives, respectively, turn out
to be deﬁned entirely in the spirit of original Lagrangian
speciﬁcation, i.e. when a ﬂuid element or a point on a
congruence are constantly identiﬁed in a local coordinate
system. It explains why in an ordinary Euclidean domain
the Lie mathematical construction takes a familiar form
of Euler’s directional derivative [5]:

LV f = V i ∂f

∂xi = (

∂
∂t

+ v · ∇)f =

(2.13)

Df
Dt

It is known as a full derivative along the vector ﬁled
V = (1, v) and in hydrodynamics it also has numerous

3

applications for the description of the motion of macro-
scopic individual bodies of ﬂuid.

In this respect, let us now consider a time variation of
the ﬂuid f -content in a macroscopic 3-dimensional space
domain V moving with the ﬂuid:

d
dt Z
V (t)

d
dt XδV (t)

Z
δV (t)

d
dt

XδV (t)

f dV =

f dV =

(f δV ) (2.14)

where, for our convenience, the macroscopic volume V (t)
is represented as the sum of individual microscopic vol-
umes δV (t), i.e. V =

δV .

P

A geometrical transformation Ht describes the evolu-
tion of the whole volume V (t) = HtV0 as well as its
individual bits δV (t) = HtδV0. The assumption that the
domain V and all δV move with the ﬂuid, means that
there is no ﬂux of f through the common bounding sur-
face of the ﬂuid domain ∂V and bounding surfaces of all
individual elements ∂δV . It imposes the condition that
normal components of the relative ﬂuid velocity ﬁeld are
zero at every point of all such surfaces moving with the
ﬂuid. By the chain rule we obtain from (2.14):

d
dt Z
V (t)

f dV =

Z
V (t)

Df
Dt

dV +

Z

XδV (t)

f

d
dt

δV (t)

(2.15)

The time variation of a microscopic volume δV is a
result of movement of each point of the bounding surface
∂δV and it is described by the divergence theorem [8]:

d
dt

δV (t) =

(n, u)dS =

(∇, u)dV

(2.16)

Z
∂δV

Z
δV

where n is a unit vector normal to the surface ∂δV and
u is the local velocity ﬁeld of surface points in the co-
ordinate system attached to δV . Since the divergence
does not depend on the choice of coordinate basis, we
can write (∇, u) = (∇, v) for the ﬂow velocity ﬁeld v
deﬁned in the main coordinate system at rest. Hence
the local rate of expansion or dilation of a microscopic
volume element δV is:

d
dt

δV (t) = (∇, v)δV

(2.17)

When this is substituted into (2.15), one gets the result
of the Convection T heorem:

d
dt Z
V (t)

(

Df
Dt

Z
V (t)

f dV =

+ f (∇, v))dV

(2.18)

More detailed and rigorous demonstrations can be found,
for instance, in [2], [9]. We only need the way it was rea-
soned as well as its interpretations for further discussions.

To ﬁnish this Section, we conclude that the formula
(2.13) for Euler’s derivative Df
Dt (as well as its integral
counter-part (2.18)) provide the rule for reconstruction
of the f -property (or the f -content) at a new position
r = r0 + dr (or in a new domain V (t) = HtV0), gener-
ally speaking, diﬀerent from the initial one. This hydro-
dynamics interpretation will become useful in the next
Section in order to contrast a complementary speciﬁca-
tion of a ﬂow ﬁeld which provides the reconstruction of
the f -property at a ﬁxed point of space r0 but at instant
t0 + dt diﬀerent from t0, entirely in the spirit of Euler’s
original idea of ﬂow ﬁeld speciﬁcation.

III. FINAL CAUCHY PROBLEM AND LOCAL
DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVE

Let us discuss in this Section some limitations of con-
ventional deﬁnitions (2.6) and (2.10) for a ﬂow ﬁeld in
situations when Lagrangian identiﬁcation is in principle
impossible. Before proceed, it will be convenient to ap-
ply the above-used terminology to clarify the deﬁnition
of the partial time derivative of a ﬂow ﬁeld f -quantity in
the framework of the classical analysis:

∂f
∂t

= lim
t→0

1
t

[f (r0, t0 + t) − f (r0, t0)]

(3.1)

where note that ∂f
∂t means not only the rate of change of
f at a ﬁxed position r0 in space but (3.1) is considered
under the condition that the space variable r0 is not a
subject of time parameter t at all (i.e. r0(t) = const).
In other words, this situation corresponds to the time
derivative of ﬂow quantities with a f rozen velocity ﬁeld
v (i.e. v = 0).

Let us now consider a time variation of the ﬂuid f -
content in a ﬁxed 3-dimensional space domain V0. If we
follow the way of reasoning used earlier for the formula-
tion of the Convection T heorem, then:

d
dt Z
V0

d
dt XδV0

Z
δV0

d
dt

XδV0

f dV =

f dV =

(f δV0)

(3.2)

where again, for our convenience, the macroscopic vol-
ume V0 is represented as the sum of individual micro-
scopic volumes δV0, i.e. V0 =

δV0.

P

Since all volume elements δV0 are now ﬁxed, the diﬀer-
ential operator d
dt acts only on f -property and is used to
be associated with the partial time derivative ∂
∂t , giving
place to the well-known relationship for a ﬁxed domain
V0 (see any text on the classical theory of ﬁelds):

4

f -property inside δV0 is necessary as it was in (2.15) for
the reliable use of Df
Dt . The integrand in the left-hand
side of (3.2) is not a simple multivariable function f (r, t)
but a rather diﬀerent mathematical entity f (r(t), t), i.e.
ﬂow ﬁeld quantity. This feature makes it diﬃcult the
straightforward application of the partial time derivative
∂
∂t meaningful for a ﬁxed space variable r as function of
a f rozen velocity ﬁeld (v = 0). Therefore, the use of
the partial time derivative does not seem to be fully jus-
tiﬁed in the conventional approach. This circumstance
was also critically pointed out in [6]-[7].

To clarify the situation, let us go through the same
mathematical construction as was used before for Euler’s
and Lie’s derivatives, i.e we shall deﬁne an appropriate
speciﬁcation of the ﬂow ﬁeld in this case. The terminol-
ogy of ordinary diﬀerential equations theory, combined
with notions from classical analysis, enables us to give
a useful and compact deﬁnition of the left-hand side of
(3.2).

Let r0 be a ﬁxed point of the closure V0 and let the
path of some identiﬁed elementary bit of ﬂuid (that at
some earlier instant t0 passed through a certain point of
space r∗(t0)) lie at present instant t0 + t on the position
of the ﬁxed point of space r0. Then the full time deriva-
tive is understood as the limit of the diﬀerence between
the values of the volume f -content at diﬀerent instants
t0 and t0 + t. This requirement provides a framework
necessary to derive analytic expression for the left-hand
side of (3.2):

d
dt Z
V0

f (r(t), t)dV =

lim
t→0

1
t Z
V0

[f (r(t0 + t), t0 + t) − f (r(t0), t0)] dV

(3.4)

where r(t0) = r0. Both values f (r(t0), t0) and f (r(t0 +
t), t0 + t) represent the f -property at the same point of
space r0.

Based on this convention we note that r(t0 + t) = r0

should lie at the end of the integral curve:

r0 = r∗

(t0) +

v(r, t)dt

(3.5)

t0+t

Z
t0

Extrapolation on a set of integral curves that ﬁll our
domain is straightforward. The path of every such curve
has to end at some ﬁxed point of the closure V0. All
of them are solutions of initial Cauchy problems for the
ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equation:

d
dt Z
V0

f dV =

∂f
∂t

dV

Z
V0

(3.3)

dr
dt

= v;

r(t0) = r∗

∈ V ∗

(3.6)

In Lagrangian speciﬁcation it represents a geometri-
cal transformation (or mapping) Ht of the original 3-
dimensional domain V ∗ at instant t0 onto HtV ∗ = V0 at

A note of caution is appropriate here. One might sus-
pect that some type of speciﬁcation of the ﬂow ﬁeld for

instant t0+t. If the inverse mapping H −1
is single-valued,
then V ∗ = H −1
t V0 can be regarded as a reconstruction of
initial conditions from the knowledge of the ﬁnal domain
V0, i.e. V ∗ becomes dependent on t parameter. Simi-
larly to (2.1), for an individual bit of ﬂuid, Ht deﬁnes
the function:

t

The inconvenience of this description is that we are now
at the local coordinate system as a function of r∗(t).
Since the integration in (3.4) is eﬀected over the ﬁxed
domain V0, we choose a local coordinate system attached
to V0 by means of coordinate transformation:

r0 = Htr∗

∗
= r(r

, t);

r0 ∈ V0

(3.7)

r∗

(t) = r0 −

v(r, t)dt

(3.13)

t0+t

Z
t0

5

where r0 is ﬁxed and belongs to V0.

By analogy with the initial Cauchy problem for (2.3),
it may be called as a ﬁnal Cauchy problem for (3.6). If
any ﬂow ﬁeld quantity has the Eulerian representation
f (r, t), its Lagrangian representation g∗ in the context of
the ﬁnal Cauchy problem will be:

g∗

(r0, t) = f (r(r0, t), t)

(3.8)

and, therefore, the partial time derivative ∂g∗
∂t (with the
ﬁxed r0) will deﬁne some new mathematical construction:

∂
∂t

g∗

(r0, t) =

D∗f
D∗t

(3.9)

Note that the diﬀerential operator D∗

D∗t makes sense
only when applied to ﬂow ﬁeld variables as functions of
the ﬁnal Cauchy problem and will be called here as the
local directional derivative by analogy with the deﬁnition
of D

Dt within the framework of classical analysis:

D∗f
D∗t

= lim
t=0

1
t

[f (r(t0 + t), t0 + t) − f (r(t0), t0)]

(3.10)

where r(t0) = r0 and we denote by r(t0 + t) the ﬁnal
point r0 of the integral curve (3.5).

To ﬁnd the analytic expression for D∗

D∗t , let us use a con-
sideration similar to the applied in the previous Section
for the deﬁnition of D
Dt . The diﬀerential equation (3.6)
will deﬁne a congruence or t-parameterized set of integral
world-lines ﬁlling a 4-dimensional space-time manifold:

dxi
dt

= V i;

0(t) = x∗i+
xi

V idt

(3.11)

t0+t

Z
t0

where x∗ = (t0, r∗) and x0 = (t0 + t, r0).

This transformation, which we denote as Gt: (x∗ →
x0 = x(x∗, t)), deﬁnes the mapping of f (x∗) along the
congruence into a new function f (x0).
In Lagrangian
speciﬁcation of the ﬂow ﬁeld it has an obvious geometri-
cal interpretation: Gt transforms the f property of the
identiﬁed ﬂuid element at x∗ according the rule:

or in 4-dimensional notations:

dx∗i
dt

= V ∗i;

x∗i(t) = xi

0+

V ∗idt

(3.14)

t0+t

Z
t0

where V ∗ = (1, −v). It deﬁnes an equivalent mapping
which we denote as G∗

t : (x0 → x∗ = x(x0, t)).

Note that G∗

t is the same mapping Gt but deﬁned in
the local coordinate system attached to V0. More pre-
cisely, it means that the ﬁnal Cauchy problem (3.6) ad-
mits an equivalent formulation as an initial Cauchy prob-
lem (3.13) (i.e. G∗
is not the inverse transformation
t
(Gt)−1, since the course of time is not changed on the
opposite one).

Thus, when t is too small, the transformation G∗

t has

an explicit form:

G∗

t x0 = x∗i(x0, t) = xi

0 + tV ∗i(x0) + o(t)

(3.15)

which gives analytic expression for the Lie derivative
along the congruence V ∗ at a local coordinate system:

LV ∗ f =

d
dt

f (G∗

t x0) = V ∗i ∂f
∂xi

(3.16)

In an ordinary Euclidean domain this mathematical con-
struction takes the following expression:

LV ∗ f = (

− (v, ∇))f =

(3.17)

∂
∂t

D∗f
D∗t

Now, noting that the integrand in the right-hand side
of the equation (3.4) is D∗f
D∗t according to the deﬁnition
(3.10), we can proceed to the formulation of our result
(3.17) as a theorem proven in an ordinary Euclidean do-
main:

Theorem 1 (Local Convection Theorem): Let v be a
vector ﬁeld generating a ﬂuid ﬂow through a ﬁxed 3-
dimensional domain V0 and if f (r, t) ∈ C1( ¯V0), then

d
dt Z
V0

(

∂
∂t

Z
V0

f dV =

− (v, ∇))f dV

(3.18)

(Gtf )(x∗

) = f (Gt(x∗

)) = f (x0)

(3.12)

where dV denotes the ﬁxed volume element.

This result formulated within the framework of ﬁnal
Cauchy problems could be regarded as a complementary
counter-part of the Convection T heorem (2.18) consid-
ered within the framework of initial Cauchy problems.

In Eulerian speciﬁcation, the formula (3.17) admits a
clear hydrodynamic interpretation: D∗f
D∗t provides the rule
for reconstruction of the f -property at a ﬁxed point of
space r0 at instant t0 + dt, based only on the knowledge
of partial time derivative ∂f
∂t and local distributions of
gradient ∇f and velocity ﬁeld v in the vicinity of r0:

f = f0 + (

− v · ∇f )dt

(3.19)

∂f
∂t

Generally speaking, this type of Eulerian speciﬁcation
of the ﬂow ﬁeld does not imply any sort of identiﬁcation
of ﬂuid elements and hence ought to be complementary
to the original Lagrangian approach. In fact, it considers
the rate of time variation of f -property locally, at ﬁxed
position of space. Whereas the Euler derivative comple-
mentarily describes the rate of time variation f ollowing
the motion of the f luid.

Both types of directional derivatives Df

D∗t can
be analyzed in terms of 1-forms or real-valued functions
of vectors in 4-dimensional manifolds:

Dt and D∗f

ω = (ωi) = (

∂f
∂xi )

(3.20)

where i = 0, 1, 2, 3 and ( ∂f
Euclidean domain.

∂xi ) = ( ∂f

∂t , ∇f ) in an ordinary

Now we point out that in tensor algebra the set {ωiV j}

are components of a linear operator or (

) tensor. The

1

formation of a scalar ω(V ) is called the contraction of
the 1-form ω with the vector V and it is an alternative
representation of directional derivatives:

Df
Dt

= ωiV i;

D∗f
D∗t

= ωiV ∗i

(3.21)

The contraction of diagonal components of the tensor
ωiV j is independent of the basis. Importantly, this law
shows that both types of directional derivatives Df
Dt and
D∗f
D∗t are invariant and do not depend on the choice of a
local coordinate system. On the other hand, it is also the
property of scalar product in manifolds with metric. The
metric tensor maps 1-forms into vectors in a 1-1 manner.
This pairing is usually written as:

ωi = gijωj;

V i = gijVj

(3.22)

Therefore, from the point of view of tensor algebra, (3.21)
can be considered as a scalar product in a 4-dimensional
manifold with metric:

6

Df
Dt

= giiωiV i;

D∗f
D∗t

= giiωiV ∗i

(3.23)

where gij = δij
is the Euclidean metric tensor. A
Minkowski metric is also consistently singled out for local
directional derivative D∗f
D∗t :

D∗f
D∗t

= giiωiV ∗i = g∗

iiωiV i

(3.24)

where V ∗ = (1, −v); g∗
nite or Minkowski metric tensor.

ij = diag(1, −1, −1, −1) is indeﬁ-

Another consequence of this form is that it gives or-
thonormal bases for space-time manifolds (previously
introduced with no metric known a priori). For La-
grangian ﬂow ﬁeld speciﬁcation, a basis is Cartesian and
a transformation matrix Λc from one such basis to an-
other is orthogonal matrix:

ΛT

c = Λ

−1
c ;

′gij = Λ

−1
c gijΛc

(3.25)

These matrices Λc form the symmetry group O(4).

Likewise, for Eulerian speciﬁcation a Minkowski met-
ric picks out a preferred set of bases known as pseudo-
Euclidean or Lorentz bases. A transformation matrix ΛL
from one Lorentz basis to another satisﬁes:

ΛT

L = Λ

−1
L ;

′g∗

ij = Λ

c g∗
−1

ijΛc

(3.26)

ΛL is called a Lorentz transformation and belongs to the
Lorentz group L(4) or O(3, 1).

The point that needs to be emphasized here is the re-
markable circumstance of Euler’s speciﬁcation in evoking
of the Minkowski metric without any previous postula-
tion.
In other words, consistent mathematical descrip-
tion of ﬂuids is perfectly compatible with the Lorentz
symmetry group. This fact was not seriously considered
in theoretical hydrodynamics until now.

The Galilean group as one of subgroups of O(4), is
commonly used in modern classical mechanics in ﬂat
space-time manifolds. This is not surprising in view that
all classical mechanics laws are written in Lagrangian
speciﬁcation by constant identiﬁcation of mechanical ob-
jects and within the formulation of initial Cauchy prob-
lem for equations of motion.
It was therefore natural
to admit that space-time in classical mechanics has a
Galilean group symmetry. The Special Relativity postu-
lation of Lorentz group symmetry on mechanics is not
trivial, having in mind the complementary character of
Lagrangian and Euler’s descriptions. Perhaps it can ex-
plain a paradoxical nature of some conclusions in rela-
tivistic mechanics but it overcomes the scope of this work
and will be considered elsewhere.

Thus, from the point of view of ﬂow ﬁeld speciﬁcations,
both kinds of directional derivatives are complementary

and equally valid but should be used in diﬀerent contexts.
Euler’s derivative has therefore a more narrow framework
of applicability in the classical ﬁeld theory than it was
supposed. In what follows we will conﬁne our attention
on some example from the classical ﬁeld theory.

IV. LOCAL DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVE IN
CLASSICAL FIELD THEORY

Let us now consider the description of the conserva-
tion of the ﬂuid f -content in an arbitrary 3-dimensional
space domain. If the volume V moves with the ﬂuid, the
Convection T heorem (2.18) written in diﬀerential form
states that the f -content is conserved when the total time
derivative is zero:

Df
Dt

∂f
∂t

+ f (∇, v) =

+ ∇(f v) = 0

(4.1)

In particular, when the velocity ﬁeld v is locally zero, it
represents the continuity equation of any elastic medium
locally at rest:

∂f
∂t

+ f (∇, v) = 0

(4.2)

where the extra term (v, ∇f ) due to the ﬂuid movement
has disappeared.

In the case when the ﬂuid moves through a volume V0
ﬁxed in local coordinate system at rest, a mathematical
restriction on conservation immediately leads to the well-
established integro-diﬀerential form of continuity equa-
tion:

d
dt Z
V0

f dV = −

f (v · dS) = −

∇(f v)dV

(4.3)

I
S0

Z
V0

Note that here both sides of the equation are obviously
independent on the choice of a particular coordinate ba-
sis.

As we already mentioned earlier in the previous Sec-
tion, it is commonly thought that, in this case, the total
time derivative can be substituted in the integrand by the
partial derivative, giving place to the conventional form
of continuity equation in the reference system at rest:

7

original integral counter-part (4.3). The left-hand side
of (4.4) becomes manifestly dependent on the choice of
a coordinate basis which, generally speaking, leads to a
more narrow group of symmetries. Let us see whether
results of the previous Section may help to clarify the
situation.

In fact, implementation of Euler’s type of ﬂow ﬁeld
speciﬁcation for the left-hand side of (4.3) in the frame-
work of the ﬁnal Cauchy problem changes the character
of the integrand expression.
If it is considered as the
local directional derivative of f -property, the continuity
equation (4.3) takes the following diﬀerential form:

D∗f
D∗t

=

∂f
∂t

− (v, ∇)f = −∇(f v)

(4.5)

that coincides with (4.2). The right-hand side of (4.5)
as a divergence and the left-hand side as the local direc-
tional derivative D∗
D∗t do not dependent on the choice of
a coordinate basis. It means that this diﬀerential form
of the continuity equation has the symmetry properties
of its original integral counter-part (4.3).

A brief comment is worthy in this respect. Why the
traditional approach based on the Convection T heorem
it is correct
gives a diﬀerent result (4.1)? Certainly,
but it has a non-invariant extra term (v, ∇f ) due to
the fact that the description is eﬀected in the reference
system at rest for the domain f ollowing the motion of
the f luid. These shortcomings of the direct application
of the Convection T heorem was not appreciated until
now. If an observer moves with the ﬂuid, this T heorem
gives the equation (4.2) without an extra term and with
the symmetry properties of the original integral equation
(4.3). On the other hand, one could logically ask why
all numerical simulations based on the standard diﬀeren-
tial form of the continuity equation (4.4) do not lead to
incorrect predictions? The answer is the following: tra-
ditional time discretization schemes for the partial time
derivative of ﬂow ﬁeld quantities (see, for instance, [11])
treat it as if it were the total time derivative.

Another interesting task would be an application of the
local derivative concept to the integral form of Maxwell’s
equations. Two of them contain the full time derivative
over volume integrals and are known as induction laws
for electric E and magnetic H vector ﬁelds, respectively,
in the local frame of reference at rest:

∂f

(∇, E)dV

The circumstance that it coincides with the expression
(4.1) derived for the volume in motion, is mainly at-
tributed to the cross-veriﬁcation of the standard dif-
ferential form of continuity equation. Nevertheless, it
is strange to contemplate that the diﬀerential equation
(4.4) does not possess the symmetry properties of its

Straightforward application of (3.18) in this case is hin-
dered by a priori unknown nature of the velocity vector

able application of the local directional derivative con-

that electromagnetic ﬁeld components of uniformly mov-
ing single charge do not depend explicitly on time pa-
rameter t. In other words, E and H are thought to be
rigidly attached to the charged particle and uniformly
move with it. This is one of the consequences of the
Relativity Principle. Thus, if the charge velocity vq is
known, the velocity vector ﬁeld v for quasistatic compo-
nents of electric and magnetic ﬁeld is also deﬁned in the
closure V . Applying the result of the Theorem (3.18), we
can rewrite (4.6)-(4.7) in a more convenient form:

where v = vq is the instantaneous velocity ﬁeld in the
closure V .

Since the motion is uniform, all partial derivatives van-
ish from (4.8)-(4.9). Applying a well-known expression
for a general vector ﬁeld A:

(v, ∇)A = v(∇A) − [∇, [v, A]]

(4.10)

and reducing the volume V to zero, we arrive to the
well-established relationship between quasistatic mag-
netic and electric ﬁeld strength of an uniformly moving
charge from the point of view of a local inertial reference
system [4]:

H =

[v, E];

E = −

It is worth stressing that a priori no relativity prin-
ciple was needed in deriving these transformation rules
for electric and magnetic ﬁeld components. The term
proportional to −(v, ∇) can be considered as convective
displacement current [10] by analogy with Maxwell’s dis-
placement current proportional to ∂
∂t . Note that the in-
tegral form of Maxwell’s equations (4.8)-(4.9) written in
Euler’s speciﬁcation is now compatible with the charge
conservation law (4.5) also represented in Euler’s speci-
ﬁcation.

On the other hand, the Lorentz and Ampere force con-
ceptions are manifestly valid quasistatic approximations
(4.11) and therefore are inclosed into integral form of
Maxwell’s ﬁeld equations on a basic level. It means that
there may be no need to postulate them separately as it
was done in Maxwell-Lorentz microscopic electron the-
ory and remains accepted at present. Nevertheless, any
full analysis of these issues comes out of the scope of the
present consideration and will be given elsewhere.

V. CONCLUSIONS

8

We attempted to consider a logical background and
structure of useful mathematical constructions which are
traditionally based on both Eulerian and Lagrangian ﬂow
ﬁeld representations, complementary to each other. This
account provides a mathematical method that justiﬁes
the deﬁnition of a complementary counter-part for Eu-
ler’s directional derivative which is called here as the local
directional derivative.

The point that needs to be emphasized is the comple-
mentary character of the above introduced concept. By
no means it substitutes the Euler mathematical construc-
tion. By contrary, it is shown that both types of direc-
tional derivatives are equally valid but should be used
in diﬀerent contexts. In fact, Euler’s substantive deriva-
tive arises in the context of initial Cauchy problems and
therefore becomes useful within the framework of the La-
grangian type of description of ﬂow ﬁeld quantities. Like-
wise, it is possible to deﬁne a complementary framework
of so-called ﬁnal Cauchy problems appropriate for the
Euler ﬂow ﬁeld speciﬁcation as a function of position in
space and in time for ﬂuid domain. From the point of
view of the classical theory of ﬁelds it means a more nar-
row framework of applicability for Euler’s derivative than
it was thought.

The analytic expression for the local directional deriva-
tive is formulated in form of a theorem analogous
and complementary to the Convection T heorem well-
established in theoretical hydrodynamics. One of its
interesting conclusions is that the choice between La-
grangian and Eulerian types of ﬂow ﬁeld representation
is equivalent to the choice between space-time mani-
folds with Euclidean and Minkowski metric, respectively.
Therefore, the consistent mathematical description of
kinematics of ﬂuids in Eulerian representation results
compatible with the Lorentz group symmetry L(4). In
fact, it could be understood as complementary to the
O(4) group symmetry compatible with the Lagrangian
representation.

On the other hand, the deﬁnition of the mathematical
construction complementary to the traditional one, helps
to get a deeper insight on the cross-veriﬁcation of several
partial diﬀerential equations obtained from their well-
established integral counter-parts in classical theory of
ﬁelds.

Although the consideration in this work was developed
for one-component (scalar) ﬂow ﬁeld, the notion of the
local directional derivative can be easily generalized on
Lie’s derivatives for any general tensor ﬁeld on diﬀeren-
tiable manifolds. Both types of Lie’s derivative will cor-
respond to both complementary types of speciﬁcations.
In place of concluding remark let us give asserting and
encouraging words of a great mathematician. Gauss once
...One
wrote in his letter to Bessel (quoted form [12]):
should never f orget that the f unction [of complex
variable], like all mathematical constructions, are only
our own creations, and that when the def inition with

which one begins ceases to make sense, one should not
ask, what is, but what is convenient to assume in order
that it remain signif icant...”.

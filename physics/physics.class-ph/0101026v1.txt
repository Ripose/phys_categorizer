Remarks on perturbation theory for Hamiltonian systems

Abstract

A comparative discussion of the normal form and
action angle variable method is presented in a tuto-
rial way. Normal forms are introduced by Lie series
which avoid mixed variable canonical transforma-
tions. The main interest is focused on establishing a
third integral of motion for the transformed Hamil-
tonian truncated at ﬁnite order of the perturbation
parameter. In particular, for the case of the action
angle variable scheme, the proper canonical trans-
formations are worked out which reveal the third
integral in consistency with the normal form. De-
tails are discussed exemplarily for the H´enon-Heiles
Hamiltonian. The main conclusions are generalized
to the case of n perturbed harmonic oscillators.

1 Introduction

The following contribution is concerned with ﬁnite
perturbation series characterized by bounded re-
mainders in properly chosen compact domains of
phase space. We are, however, not interested here in
estimating the rest terms. As has been known since
Poincar´e, inﬁnite perturbation series for Hamilto-
nians, in general, do not converge in compact do-
mains. Or more precisely, if convergence takes place
according to the KAM theorem, then it generally
occurs in an invariant subset of phase space whose
complement is open and dense [1].

Let us assume that the Hamiltonian can be
brought into the form H = h + ǫV where h refers
to n uncoupled harmonic oscillators and ǫ is the
smallness parameter. Then the main diﬀerences of a
perturbative treatment by normal forms and mixed
variable generating functions, respectively, can be
characterized as follows. In the latter method one

uses action angle variables I
(J, ψ)
to ﬁnd a canonical transformation (I, φ)
which makes the transformed Hamiltonian indepen-
dent of ψ in a certain domain D of phase space.
For an elementary introduction into this method,
including the main ideas of the proof of the KAM
theorem, the textbook [2] is recommended. In the
normal form case, on the other hand, one adopts
complex canonical variables (uν , vν ), and tries to
make H canonically equivalent to n harmonic oscil-
lators given by

Both strategies fail, because terms with resonance
denominators occur to any order, in general, which
cannot be transformed away. Thus, even if one ac-
cepts a ﬁnite cutoﬀ at order ǫN , it is not possible,
in general, to transform a Hamiltonian into an inte-
grable form. There seems to be at least one advan-
tage with normal forms: they straightforwardly pro-
vide us with a third integral. As a consequence, in
the case of two degrees of freedom, for instance, the
cutoﬀ part of the Hamiltonian which is normalized
up to order N , is integrable within the deﬁnition
domain of the normal form transformation. In the
case of the H´enon-Heiles Hamiltonian [3] this was
ﬁrst demonstrated by [4]. As a further advantage,
the normal form transformation can be carried out
very eﬃciently by Lie series and thus by symbolic
computer algebra [1].

As a power series in ǫ, both perturbation schemes
should be equivalent. However, it does not seem
to be obvious, how the third integral can be de-
tected in the action angle variable picture. We will
adopt an iterated transformation scheme where new
canonical variables are introduced at each perturba-

1

tion order. Eventually, an elementary linear canon-
ical transformation will make coming forth the ad-
ditional integral. For demonstration, the H´enon-
Heiles Hamiltonian is considered. The results are
generalized to the case of n perturbed harmonic os-
cillators.

The existence of a third integral up to order ǫN
may be useful in Nekhoroshev-like estimates [5],[6],
[8]. For instance, in the three body problem an ap-
proximate integral, in addition to energy and angu-
lar momentum, should help to get sharper bounds
for the remainders. We make use of this occasion to
remark, that a former study by the present author
[9] on the three body problem in celestial mechanics,
essentially, was a failure because of explicitly and
tacitly (eq.(77)) adopted adiabatic assumptions; the
rigorous estimates in the Appendices C and D of
[9], on the other hand, may be helpful elsewhere for
similar problems. The N-body problem of celestial
mechanics was recently examined more rigorously
by [10] within the Nekhoroshev scheme.

In the next section we will brieﬂy introduce to the
Lie series formulation of time dependent perturba-
tion theory for Hamiltonian systems. Most numer-
ical integrators are based on time series with small
time step. Section 2 also serves to prepare the Lie
series method for normal forms in section 3. In sec-
tion 4 the perturbation method by action angle vari-
ables will be discussed. In appendix A we present a
proof of a recursive formalism for Lie series [1], and
in appendix B an exact canonical transformation is
presented which brings the H´enon-Heiles Hamilto-
nian into an integrable form up to the second order
of the perturbation parameter.

2 Time dependent perturbation

We assume ﬁnite dimensional systems. The Hamil-
tonian ﬁeld generates a ﬂow which, during the time
t, maps a phase space domain D0 of initial points
If the ﬁeld is suﬃciently
into the domain Dt.
smooth in the image domains Dτ for τ
(0, t),
In particular, in-
then Dt is diﬀeomorph to D0.
ner points of D0 are mapped into inner points of
Dt, and the boundaries of Dt and D0 are equally

∈

smooth. Moreover, by the Liouville theorem, the
domain volumes are preserved. Chaotic behaviour,
clearly, develops for such systems, if at all, as an
asymptotic property. Its observability depends on
the adopted degree of resolution.

Lie series. A cutoﬀ at N = 4 corresponds to a

If H and
f are given analytically, the coeﬃcients of the Lie
series can also be determined analytically, e.g. by
means of symbolic computer calculators. However,
in each step symplecticity is fulﬁlled only up to an
error of order [∆t]N +1. In numerical problems, it
may be more adequate to adopt so-called symplectic
integrators which are canonical in every step within
the number precision of the computer, see e.g. [11].
The remainder of the truncated Lie series, on the
other hand, can be rigorously expressed through (if
f is scalar)

O([∆t]N +1) =

[∆t]N +1 with t∗

teriori knowledge on the domain of (p, q), the re-
mainder can be estimated by upper bounds.

made dimensionless, in particular H=1, which im-
plies that the smallness parameter ǫ is proportional
to the square root √E of the energy of a given tra-
jectory. With the aid of the linear canonical trans-
formation (pν, qν)

(uν, vν ) where

→

uν = (qν

i pν)/√2, vν = i (qν + i pν)/√2, (10)

−

we obtain

which has the suitable form for being subject to a
normal form transformation.

In section 2,

from the time evolution (p0, q0)
(p(t), q(t)), we had derived as generator of a
→
canonical transformation the operator exp[t LH].
Clearly, any function H(p, q) which does not ex-
plicitly depend on time, gives rise to such a gen-
erator. Moreover, the variable t in exp[t LH] does
not need to be identiﬁed as time, it can be any real
parameter. This is seen e.g., when symplecticity
is inferred from the Poisson bracket Lp q calculated
with respect to (p0, q0).
It is therefore legitimate
to adopt ǫ as parameter of the generating function
[7]. The point of view adopted here is to gener-
ate, at any given time t, a canonical transformation
(p(t; ǫ = 0), q(t; ǫ = 0))
(p(t; ǫ), q(t; ǫ)) , which
→
is parametrized with respect to the interaction pa-
rameter ǫ. The transformed Hamiltonian is written
as a power series

H(p(t; ǫ), q(t, ǫ)) = h(p(t; 0), q(t; 0)) +

Hk(p(t; 0), q(t; 0))ǫk

(12)

∞

Xk=1

with h being the unperturbed Hamiltonian. Clearly,
such canonical transformations can be achieved by
means of arbitrary scalar functions. In the following
it is convenient to write the generating function in
the form

The canonical transformation of an arbitrary

tion (we omit writing the time parameter)

(17)

then the arbitrary functions χk will be at our dispo-
sition to simplify the Hamiltonian coeﬃcients Hk.
Henceforth we will write simply (p, q) for the phase
space variables (p(ǫ = 0), q(ǫ = 0)). As is shown
in Appendix A, the transformed terms, Hk, can be
determined recursively as follows [1]

are not in the range of Lh, and therefore cannot
be removed by the generating function χ1. Clearly,
the resonance case is possible for monomials of even
only. Since V , according to (11), consists
order
of third order terms, eq.(20) is solvable for χ1 with
H1 set equal to zero. The general solution includes
an arbitrary part of the kernel of Lh consisting of
resonance monomials. If, as usual, this kernel part
is set equal to zero, χ1 is uniquely given by a linear
combination of the monomials occurring in V . Fur-
thermore, V1 = Lχ1 V is now determined in terms
of 4-th order monomials.

We examine the next iteration, which will be suf-
ﬁcient to reveal the general structure of the normal-
ized Hamiltonian:

H0 = h; Lh χ1 + H1 = V0;

Lh χ2 + H2 =

Let us start with the term k = 1. Then we have,

with V0 ≡

V ,

P

Lh χ1 + H1 = V,

(20)

and we try to set H1 = 0 with the implication
that χ1 has to fulﬁl the relation Lh χ1 = V . To
discuss, whether V is in the range of the homol-
ogy [12] operator Lh, we adopt the canonical vari-
ables (10) together with the representation (1) of
h. Furthermore, we exploit the fact that V is a lin-
ear combination of monomials of the form U m :=
2 vm4

Here, V1 contains both types of monomials, nonres-
onant ones which are in the range of the operator
Lh and resonant monomials. The latter must be
compensated by H2, while the nonresonant terms
are transformed away by the proper choice of χ2.
This is typical of all orders. Thus, an optimal sim-
pliﬁcation is achieved when the generating function
is disposed of in such a way that the transformed
Hamiltonian terms Hk contain resonant monomials
only.

When this normalization is carried out up to or-

der N , then the truncated Hamiltonian

H (N ) :=

ǫk Hk

(24)

N

Xk=0

is a constant of motion up to a rest term of the
order ǫN +1. Moreover, by the deﬁnition (22) of the
resonance monomials and because of (21), we have
the property

(25)

Lh H (N ) = 0
which tells that h is in involution with H (N ) and
therefore a further constant of motion. As should be
remarked, the remainder RN +1 in general is ﬁnite
within properly chosen domains of phase space [1].
Let E and h be the integral constants of a given
trajectory. Going back to the original variables and
choosing as Poincar´e surface of section the plane

q2 = 0, one eliminates the variable p2 from the en-
ergy integral through

In the ﬁrst step, one substitutes the old action
variables in terms of the new ones as usual to obtain

h = h (p1, q1, p2(p1, q1, E)) .

p2 = p2(p1, q1, q2 = 0; E),

and inserts p2 into the third integral

The
latter
equation implicitly deﬁnes one-dimensional mani-
folds M (p1, q1; E, h) = 0 which for constant energy
E and diﬀerent values h were ﬁrst plotted in refer-
ence [4]. The manifolds turned out as closed curves
corresponding to the intersection of 2-tori with the
Poincar´e plane and thus demonstrating the integra-
bility of the approximated H´enon- Heiles Hamilto-
ǫ2, as is well
nian. For small enough energies E
known, this picture is conﬁrmed by numerical inte-
gration of the model. A compact symmetrized form
of the normalized H´enon-Heiles Hamiltonian can be
found in [13]

(33)

Here, with the unperturbed oscillator freqencies
ω1 = ω2 = 1, this is possible, because resonance
components of V with n1 + n2 = 0 do not exist.
With this, the transformed Hamiltonian reads

H (1) = J1 + J2 + ǫ2V (2)(J1, J2, ψ1, ψ2; ǫ)

(34)

where, due to the elimination of the old angle vari-
ables φν in terms of ψν, the potential V (2) now is
an inﬁnite power series in ǫ.

Proceeding to second order, with the canonical
( ˜J1, ˜J2, ˜ψ1, ˜ψ2) de-
transformation (J1, J2, ψ1, ψ2)
ﬁned by F (2)( ˜J1, ˜J2, ψ1, ψ2), we obtain the trans-
formed Hamiltonian (omitting the tilde, for simplic-
ity)

In order to reveal a third integral in the truncated
part of the perturbatively transformed Hamilto-
nian, we stepwise introduce generating functions as
follows

where

F (n)(J1, J2, φ1, φ2) = J1φ1 + J2φ2 +
ǫn S(n)(J1, J2, φ1, φ2),

(30)

n = 1, 2, .., which implicitly deﬁne new canoni-
cal torus variables (I1, I2, φ1, φ2)
(J1, J2, ψ1, ψ2)

In order to see that this property continues to
higher orders, it will be suﬃcient to go one pertur-
bative step further. With the aid of the generating

In the last bracket the remainder of order ǫ stems
from the expansion of V (3)(

in ǫ. The decisive point is that, by the chosen ǫ-
dependence of the generating functions (30), the
frequencies remain unrenormalized. This is also the
case in the normal form method. As a consequence,
we have the same resonance condition n1 + n2 = 0.
Taking into account that ψν = ˜ψν + O(ǫ3), we ob-
tain the third order transformed Hamiltonian (once
more omitting the tilde) in the form

H (3) = J1 + J2 + ǫ2h2(J1, J2) + ǫ3h3(J1, J2) +

to an integrable truncated H´enon-Heiles Hamilto-
nian in agreement with the normal form.

In every perturbation step one has to keep track
of the deﬁnition domain of the new action variables.
For instance, if the original variable I1 is deﬁned
in the positive interval [0, d1], then by (31) J1 +
ǫn∂S(n)/∂φ1 is conﬁned to the same domain. As a
consequence, we have to restrict J1 to J1 ∈

tors. We ﬁrst discuss the normal form method.

As is remarked, even if the frequencies are all ra-

with mν = m′

form method, the truncated normalized Hamilto-
nian H (N ) consists of resonance monomials only,
eq.(41) implies the commutation of the Poisson
bracket, namely Lh H (N ) = 0, and thus establishes
a third integral h in addition to the energy H (N ).

1. Therefore J ′

As a ﬁnal remark, the Hamiltonian of the three-
body problem in celestial mechanics (and straight-
forwardly also the N -body case) can be expressed in
terms of suitable action angle variables which avoid
(chart dependent) singularities at small inclinations
and eccentricities, see e.g.
[9]. It would be inter-
esting to ﬁnd out, whether a third integral can be
worked out in a ﬁnite order perturbation procedure.
This may be helpful in estimating upper bounds
over ﬁnite time intervals of the order of the age of
the planetary system.

We prove here the recursion relations (18) and (19)
in a diﬀerent way as compared with reference [15].
First we show that the coeﬃcients gk of an arbitrary
k gk ǫk can be determined
function g(p(ǫ), q(ǫ)) =
by the following recursive system [1]

P

g0 = g(p, q);

g−n = 0 for n = 1, 2, ..;

from the recursion system, we multiply with ǫn and

Appendix B:
Integrable second
order form of the H´enon-Heiles
Hamiltonian

We start from the transformed Hamiltonian (35),
neglect the remainder V (3), and write at ﬁrst the re-
sulting Hamiltonian H (2)
trunc in terms of action angle
variables as deﬁned in (37). We will abbreviate the
constant of motion J ′
1 by J. When the action angle
variables (J ′
2) are expressed by (28) in terms of
cartesian symplectic magnitudes (p, q), we can write
after some eﬀorts

This is one-degree of freedom Hamiltonian which
can be brought into integrable form in a standard
way, see e.g. [16]. The corresponding, exact canon-
ical transformation from (p, q) to action angle vari-
able (I, Φ) is found as

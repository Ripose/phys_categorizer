Abstract— We study systematically the characteristics of an-
tenna superstrates based on closely located periodical grids of
loaded wires. An explicit method based on the local ﬁeld approach
is used to study the reﬂection and transmission properties of such
superstrates. It is shown that as a result of proper impedance
loading there exists a rather wide frequency band over which
currents induced to the grids cancel each other leading to a wide
transmission maximum. In this regime radiation is produced
by the magnetic dipole moments created by circulating out-
of-phase currents ﬂowing in the grids. An impedance matrix
representation and equivalent circuit model are derived for
the superstrates, and the analytical results are validated using
full wave simulations. As a practical application we study the
radiation pattern of a dipole antenna illuminating ﬁnite size
superstrates. Discussion is conducted on the effects of ﬁnite
structural dimensions and feed structures.

I. INTRODUCTION

Artiﬁcial dielectrics, implemented e.g. as arrays of wires,
have been used for decades as light-weight beam shaping
elements, see e.g. [1]–[6] for some early contributions and
[7], [8] for some more recent results. It is nowadays well
understood that some electromagnetic (photonic) crystals sim-
ulate the behavior of homogeneous materials with ultra-low
refractive index near stop-band edges [9], [10], [11]. This
observation has lead to several studies concerning directive
antenna design using such periodical structures to shape the
beam of a low-gain primary radiator, e.g. [12]–[14]. It is also
known that a slight local change in the period of electromag-
netic crystals leads to localized resonant modes which can
be used for the realization of devices radiating energy in a
very narrow angular range [15]. Typically, radiating sources
are placed inside Fabry-Perot resonant cavities formed by
removal of rows of wires or dielectric rods in a periodical
lattice [16]–[21]. The long-known ideas of creating resonant
cavities using partially reﬂecting sheets [22] have also been
widely employed in recent gain enhancement designs [23]–
[27]. Similarly, frequency-selective surfaces on top of ground
planes have been used to implement Fabry-Perot resonant
cavities, e.g. [28]. Antenna superstrates are another well-
known gain enhancement tool [29], [30]. As in the case of

defected electromagnetic crystal structures [16]–[21] one of
the key ideas of different superstrates is to allow radiation from
a primary source to spread over a larger radiating aperture.
Recently, very exotic structures such as material covers or
superstrates aimed to possess double-negative behavior [31]
have been proposed for this purpose [32], [33], [34].

The goal of this work is to present an analytical methodol-
ogy for studying the characteristics of a class of composite
structures proposed as superstrates for low-gain antennas.
More precisely, we consider two closely located parallel
grids of capacitively loaded wires having possibly a grid
of continuous (purely inductive) wires between them. The
methodology presented here can, however, be extended to
study the characteristics of other kinds of superstrates based
on multiple grids of wires loaded with arbitrary distributed
impedance. The physics behind the operational principle of
such superstrates is clariﬁed. We will also brieﬂy discuss
extending the methodology to handle strongly coupled dipole
grids, as over a certain frequency range the dispersion prop-
erties of a capacitively loaded wire medium are known to
resemble those of a medium consisting of small dipole scat-
terers [35]. The transmission properties of strongly coupled
dipole grids have in the past been analyzed with an application
to frequency-selective surfaces or electromagnetic band-gap
structures e.g. in [36], [37], [38]. In these works the response
has been calculated using an iterative method based upon
solving a set of coupled integral equations for the unknown
element currents and aperture ﬁelds. The method presented
here is explicit, and despite taking into account all the near
ﬁeld interactions between the grids (higher order Floquet
modes) it remains computationally efﬁcient and physically
illustrative.

The novelty of the proposed superstrate designs is to excite
resonant oscillations in capacitively loaded wires (this way
creating a wider radiating aperture) while maintaining partial
transparency of the structure. In the designs considered here
the source ﬁeld induces out-of-phase currents to the loaded
wire pairs, and the pairing currents give rise to magnetic
dipole moments that produce radiation. We start the analysis
by explaining heuristically the operational principle of the
superstrates. After this,
the local ﬁeld method is used to
analytically study the reﬂection and transmission properties
of the superstrates. The results are validated using full wave
simulations and we also calculate the electric and magnetic
dipole moments induced to one of the structures. It is shown
that a strong resonant enhancement of the superstrate aperture
ﬁeld can be achieved with very thin superstrates and without

the need to create resonant cavities. Based on the electrody-
namic model an impedance matrix representation is derived
for the superstrates in order to construct an equivalent circuit
model taking into account the mutual interaction between the
wire grids. Finally, we calculate and simulate some example
radiation patterns of dipole antennas illuminating ﬁnite size
superstrates. It is demonstrated that the key features observed
with plane wave excitation of inﬁnite superstrates are also seen
with ﬁnite size superstrates illuminated by dipole antennas.
The effects of ﬁnite structural sizes to the superstrate perfor-
mance are discussed.

II. HEURISTIC OPERATIONAL PRINCIPLE

The superstrate studied in this work is schematically de-
picted in Fig. 1a. The ﬁrst and third grids (see the numbering
of grids in Fig. 1a) consist of parallel capacitively loaded1
wires, while the second grid consists of continuous (inductive)
thin wires. Please note that
in Fig. 1 round wires have
been replaced by strips to reﬂect one feasible implementation
technique. However, in the following analytical derivation we
assume round wires since electrically thin wires and strips
behave in a similar manner. To account for the difference in
the geometry an effective radius of wires is introduced in the
analytical analysis.

The properly designed structure is expected to show an
analogy with double-negative behavior: In a certain frequency
range the metal strips constituting a capacitively loaded wire
can be interpreted as short dipoles, and every pair of such
dipoles (sitting in grids 1 and 3) shows a magnetic resonant
mode which can be utilized to create a response similar to
that of split rings [39], [40]. On the other hand, the long
conductors provide plasma-like electric response as in wire
media [41], [42]. Recently, it has been reported that only short

in scale). b) Unit cell geometry.

wire pairs are enough to obtain double-negative behavior [43],
[44]. For describing the radiation properties of the superstrate
we concentrate, however, on the local dipole moments induced
in the structure.

Consider ﬁrst only a pair of two capacitively loaded wires
(we assume that grid 2 is absent). At a certain frequency
the currents induced to individual pairing metal strips cancel
each other allowing the incident wave to propagate through
the grids. To widen the pass-band one can bring a grid of
solid wires in between the loaded wire grids. In this case two
modes appear due to the capacitances and mutual coupling
between the loaded wires and the continuous wires. In other
words, there are now two possibilities for the currents in
the grids to cancel each other, and by properly choosing the
unit cell dimensions both transmission bands can be merged
together. Since the superstrate is volumetric (though the total
thickness 2h is in practise extremely small compared with
the wavelength) the cancelation of total electric current does
not mean the cancelation of radiation: The superstrate is
effectively transparent for the incident waves, however, the
magnetic dipole moments induced in the pairing metal strips
produce radiation. These dipole moments are distributed over
the superstrate, thus every strip pair in the structure will radiate
principally in a similar manner allowing the realization of a
more or less uniform aperture phase distribution on the outer
superstrate surface.

Another important practical issue, discussed later in more
details, is the interaction between a closely located primary
radiator and the loaded wire grids. It will be shown that in
case of capacitively loaded wires the source can be brought
very close to the grids without deteriorating the radiation
resistance. This allows to design low-proﬁle and effectively
radiating structures.

III. LOCAL FIELD METHOD TO STUDY THE SUPERSTRATE
PROPERTIES

A. Plane-wave reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients and
induced electric and magnetic dipole moments

Though in most of the following parts of the paper we
consider the situation when only the grids of loaded wires
are present, we will conduct the derivation for the three-
grid structure depicted in Fig. 1a. This is to illustrate the
feasibility of our method to handle inclusions with different
polarizabilities. At this point we assume that the grids in
the superstrate are inﬁnite in z and x directions. Moreover,
the transversal thickness t of the inclusions (equivalently the
radius r0 of round wires) is small compared to the wavelength.
We assume the normal plane-wave incidence (though the
analysis can be carried out for oblique incidence as well) and
write the external electric ﬁeld as

Eext = uzEexte−jky.

(1)

We write down the equation for the local electric ﬁeld acting
on the surface of a reference element in each of the grids.
Consider ﬁrst the unloaded reference wire. We assume that
the wires are thin enough so that we can represent them as
inﬁnitely long current lines located at the wires axis. The

relation between the amplitude of the local electric ﬁeld Eloc
acting on the wire surface and current I ﬂowing on the wire
surface reads

Physically β(0) tells how strongly the wires located in the

whereas β(h), β(2h) measure the inﬂuence of the other two

As an example, we calculate the dipole moments induced
to a structure that consists of two grids of capacitively loaded
wires (in this case grid 2 is absent in Fig. 1a). The electric
and magnetic dipole moment densities on the superstrate are
calculated as [48]

where ρ is the charge density in the unit volume (see Fig. 1b
for the unit cell) and J is the corresponding volumetric current
density. When the integrations are conducted in our geometry
the dipole moments take the following form:

1) Discussion on the modeling approach: It is known that
at low frequencies (frequencies at which the structural dimen-
sions are small compared to the wavelength) the dispersion
properties of lattices of capacitively loaded wires and dipole
scatterers rather closely resemble each other [35]. Noticeable
deviation is seen only close to the frequencies where the
strip length in the loaded wires becomes resonant. At these
frequencies (and at higher frequencies), for accurate analysis,
one should model the ﬁrst and third grids as grids of dipole
scatterers. The principal ideas of the above derivation would
still be the same, however, different models for inclusion polar-
izabilities and interaction constants should be used [49]–[51].
It will be demonstrated below, however, that in the frequency
regime where the superstrates are feasible for antenna beam
shapers, the capacitively loaded wire model leads to accurate
results. It is also important to note that the method described
above can be used to study the properties of superstrates
formed by an arbitrary number of grids, and the distributed
impedance loading the wires can be arbitrary.

2) Numerical validation: For the validation of the ana-
lytical method we choose for the superstrate the structural
parameters considered in [34] (the notation is clear from
Fig. 1): l = 12.11 mm, ld = 10.11 mm, t = 1 mm, d = 4.8
mm, h = 1 mm. We conduct strip to wire conversion and use
text book formulas to estimate the distributed capacitance due
to the slits in the wires in ﬁrst and third grids.

For calculating the reﬂection and transmission coefﬁcients
we consider separately two structures. In the ﬁrst one only
the two grids of capacitively loaded wires are present. In the
second case we bring the grid of continuous wires in between
the loaded wire grids as shown in Fig. 1a. Reﬂection and
transmission coefﬁcients are calculated using eqs. (14) and
(15). We also simulate the coefﬁcients using Ansoft HFSS
[52] (the unit cell for HFSS simulations is shown in Fig. 1b).
The results of calculations and simulations are depicted in
Figs. 2 and 3. We observe that the agreement between the
analytical calculations and simulations is good up to 13 GHz.
At this frequency the length of the metal strips in the loaded
wires is already roughly λ/2, so it is clear that at frequencies
higher than 13 GHz (in this particular case) the local ﬁeld
model based on loaded wires fails. Nevertheless, for antenna
applications we are interested in the frequency regime where
the superstrates are partially transparent (frequency regime in
which the transmission maxima lie, see Figs. 2, 3), and at
these frequencies the analytical model works well.

The amplitudes of electric and magnetic dipole moment
densities induced to the superstrate consisting of the two grids
of loaded wires are shown in Fig. 4. As speculated earlier,
the magnetic dipole moment shows a strong resonance in the
vicinity of the frequency where the structure is effectively
transparent for incident radiation. It is worth to note that
at the frequency of magnetic resonance the thickness of the
superstrate is only λ/12.

derive an impedance matrix representation [53] connecting the

Equivalent circuit model for the three grid superstrate shown in

The equivalent circuit representation allows us to quickly
determine the eigen modes of the superstrate. As an example
of its use we choose once again the structure consisting only of
capacitively loaded wires, and calculate using nodal analysis
the frequency at which the currents induced to the grids
(currents I1 and I2 in Fig. 5) are equal in amplitude and
out of phase. This frequency roughly corresponds to the deep
minimum of the reﬂection coefﬁcient at 11.9 GHz observed
in Fig. 3. The analysis based on the equivalent circuit predicts
that the currents have equal amplitude and opposite phase
at frequency 10.2 GHz. This result slightly differs from the
result predicted by the electrodynamic model (the difference
is approximately 15 %), however, when taking into account all
the limitations of the equivalent circuit representation (quasi-
static nature) the agreement between the results is considered
reasonably good.

IV. FINITE SIZE SUPERSTRATES ILLUMINATED BY WIRE
ANTENNAS

In this section we study and discuss the performance of
ﬁnite size superstrates when illuminated by real antennas.
Our primary source is a resonant λ/2-dipole antenna, and
we consider here for the sake of clarity only the superstrate
consisting of two grids of capacitively loaded wires. The
antenna geometry is depicted schematically in Fig. 6. The
antenna could also be backed by a ground plane, and the
to create Fabry-Perot
superstrate could be used as a tool
resonant cavity to possibly further enhance the directivity. This
design option is not, however, considered here. The number
of wires in x-direction is Nx and in this analysis we call

the other grids are zero. The component of the total (averaged)
electric ﬁeld parallel to the grids, deﬁned in the plane of grid
i is by deﬁnition [46]

C. Equivalent circuit representation

The equivalent circuit of the superstrate can be derived by
looking at the actual structure shown in Fig. 1. The resulting
circuit is shown in Fig. 5. Let us clarify the reasoning behind
the circuit in details: In Fig. 5 L denotes the averaged (quasi-
static) inductance of a wire array which is available e.g. in
[42]. C is the capacitance of a short strip (formula for this
estimation is available e.g. in [46]) and C0 is the capacitance
between the metal strips in the grid plane. Essentially the series
connection of L and C0 models the capacitively loaded wire
medium [35] and we have added C in parallel to this connec-
tion to represent the resonance due to strip length (this effect
is rather weak in the quasi-static regime). Further, C1 and C2
are the capacitance between the dipole grid and wire grid,
and the capacitance between the dipole grids, respectively.
Textbook formulas have been used to estimate C0, C1, C2. M2
and M3 are the mutual inductances representing the interaction
between different grids. These are obtained as the quasi-static
limit for Im{Z21} and Im{Z31}, respectively:

the grids R = 2h, and the distance between the wires in the
grids d is the same as introduced in Section III. Compared
to the numerical validation presented at the end of Section
III (in that case we wanted the modeled setup to correspond
as accurately as possible to the structure considered in [34])
we make some changes to the structural parameters of the
loaded wires. The distributed capacitance level is, however,
kept at the same value as considered in Section III to ease
the comparison. We do the modiﬁcations in order to assure
that the metal strips are electrically short enough so that the
model based on capacitively loaded wires remains accurate.
The modiﬁed parameters read (see Fig. 1): ld = 5.74 mm,
l = ld + 0.1 mm, t = 1.25 mm.

The radiation characteristics (radiation patterns and the
radiation resistance) of the antenna structure are analytically
calculated using the method introduced in [54], [55]. This
method is explicit and accurate [54], and it is based on the
rigorous summation of the ﬁelds created by the source currents
and currents induced to the passive wires. The method assumes
that the wires are long (the propagation constant in the z-
direction is the same for all
it allows us
to conveniently study separately the currents induced to the
passive wires by each of the source harmonics. At the end of
this section we verify the radiation characteristics of the ﬁnal
antenna design (having ﬁnite wire height) using a commercial
method-of-moments solver FEKO [56].

the wires), but

A. Example results

Inevitably there will be a strong near ﬁeld interaction
between the dipole and the grids when R is moderate. Com-
pared to the situation analyzed in Section III (the number of
wires is inﬁnite in x-direction) the ﬁnite number of wires (in
practise also the ﬁnite height of wires) leads to the formation
of standing waves along x-direction. This formation also
strongly depends on the location of the source and on the
number of wires. It was also observed in [8] that the radiation
resistance of antennas using capacitively loaded wires as beam
shapers can change rather strongly as a function of frequency.
Thus, the practical antenna design2 based on the proposed
superstrates will be a detailed optimization problem, and this
is out of the scope of the present paper. Here we only illustrate
some of the main observations presented so far in the paper. At
the end of the section an antenna structure showing acceptable
performance will be designed.

Our preliminary calculations have shown that when the
dipole is positioned rather close to the grid (in our ﬁrst
calculations R = 2h) the frequency at which the currents in the
grids cancel each other is located in the vicinity of 12.8 GHz.
This frequency is roughly 7 % higher than the corresponding
frequency observed using plane wave excitation, and the slight
difference can well be explained by the above discussion.
As an example demonstrating the cancelation of currents we
choose Nx = 15, R = 2h and calculate the amplitudes

2In practise measures such as the impedance bandwidth, deviation in
beam widths, backward radiation level, and side lobe levels as a function
of frequency, should be analyzed in details.

of currents induced to the grids by the source harmonic
corresponding to kz = 0 (the amplitude of the feed current
is assumed to be unity). The phase difference between the
currents induced to the pairing wires will also be calculated.
We perform the calculation at
three frequencies: At 12.8
GHz (corresponding to the expected transmission frequency),
at 11.6 GHz, and at 14.0 GHz. The amplitudes of currents
induced to the grids at different frequencies are depicted in
Fig. 7. The phase differences in the pairing wires are shown
in Fig. 8.

When inspecting the amplitude levels we observe that at
12.8 GHz the amplitudes of the induced current are most
uniformly distributed in the grids. At the lower and higher
example frequency only the wires closest to the dipole are
strongly excited. We also notice that at 12.8 GHz the phase
difference in all the wires is very close to π implying that the
currents in the grids cancel each other allowing the particular
harmonic to propagate through the grid. At 11.6 GHz the
phase difference is close to π in most of the pairing wires

Phase differences in the pairing wires at different frequencies. The

but only the wires closest to the dipole are effectively excited
(please see the amplitude levels). At 14.0 GHz the phase
difference deviates in several pairing wires signiﬁcantly from
π. It was observed in [55] that when a wire antenna is
placed very close to a lattice of (properly) capacitively loaded
wires the source current and the current induced to the closet
passive wires add up constructively leading to reasonable high
radiation resistance. The radiation resistance, calculated as in
[54], is at the three studied frequencies 71.6 Ω, 43.5 Ω, and
9.6 Ω, respectively. Thus, at 12.8 GHz the structure radiates
effectively and can be easily matched to a standard 75 Ω
feeding line.

Though the ﬁnite size superstrate performs with a realistic
primary source as discussed in the previous sections (in the
vicinity of 12.8 GHz) and the radiation resistance has a
reasonably high value, the radiation pattern, depicted in Fig. 9,
is not suitable for most of the applications. With the particular
structural parameters the phase difference between different
pairing currents is favorable for multiple side lobes to appear
in the H-plane. The optimization of this particular structure
to perform in a desirable way would be, as mentioned earlier,
an optimization problem and out of the scope of this paper.
Below we will, however, present a design that performs in a
relatively desirable manner.

We reduce the number of wires in x-direction to Nx = 5
(the width of the superstrate is approximately 1.2λ at 12.8
GHz) and change the distance between the source and the
ﬁrst grid to R = 4h. The calculated radiation patterns, and
the H-plane radiation pattern simulated in FEKO are shown
in Fig. 10. They are in very good agreement showing the
feasibility of the used analytical method. The wire height in
FEKO simulations is 3λ. The calculated radiation resistance is
55.8 Ω implying that the structure radiates effectively and is
easy to match to a 50 Ω feeding line. The directivity obtained

V. CONCLUSION

We have presented a method to analyze the characteristics
of a class of antenna superstrates based on periodical grids
of loaded wires. In addition to this, the physics behind the
radiation mechanism of such superstrates has been clariﬁed.
Local ﬁeld method has been used to solve for the currents
induced to the superstrates by incident plane-wave ﬁeld, and
reﬂection and transmission properties of the superstrates have
been studied. The analytical results have been veriﬁed using
numerical simulations. In addition to this, we have derived an
impedance matrix and equivalent circuit representations for the
superstrates. As a practical application we have considered
ﬁnite size superstrates illuminated by realistic sources, and
discussed the effects of ﬁnite structural dimensions to the
superstrate performance. We believe that the results presented
here can be helpful to later design optimized antennas utilizing
the proposed superstrates.

Abstract.

It is shown that the well-known procedure for proving the equivalence of
the expressions for the electric ﬁeld calculated using the Lorentz and Coulomb
gauges is incorrect. The diﬀerence between the two gauges is due to the diﬀer-
ence in the speed of propagation of a disturbance of the scalar potential. As
an auxiliary result, it is proven that the solution for the electric ﬁeld cannot
be obtained directly from the Maxwell equations, i.e. without introducing the
scalar and vector potentials.

1. Introduction.

Recently, Tzontchev et al. [1] reported on an experiment in which they
detected a longitudinal component of the electric ﬁeld propagating at the speed
of light in the near ﬁeld of a radiator. This result seems to be obvious because
an electric ﬁeld propagating with the speed of light can easily be calculated, for
example, by using Eq. 14.14 in [2]. However, the problem is that Eq. 14.14 was
derived using the Lorentz gauge in which disturbances of the scalar potential
propagate with the speed c. Because it follows from the experiment described
in [1] that 0.95 of the total magnitude of the E ﬁeld is created by the scalar
potential, it can be concluded that the scalar potential propagates at the speed
of light. However, this contradicts conventional electrodynamics. It has been
established in classical electrodynamics that the EM potential cannot be treated
as a physical quantity, but as a mathematical tool for calculating EM ﬁelds [2]
(Ch. 6.5, 3). Therefore, the solutions of the wave equation can be chosen so
that the speed of propagation u of the scalar potential can vary from zero to
inﬁnity. By choosing such solutions, the gauge is also determined [4].

The most used gauges in electrodynamics are the Coulomb ( u = ∞) and
Lorentz (u = c) gauges. However, the inﬁnite speed of propagation of the scalar
potential in the Coulomb gauge seems to contradict the theory of relativity.
Despite this, references [3, 2 (p 291, problem 6.20)] state that the issues of
causality and of the ﬁnite speed of propagation of electromagnetic disturbances
are obscured by the choice of the Coulomb gauge: the potentials ϕ(u) and A(u)
are manifestly not causal, but the ﬁelds can be shown to be. So it contradicts
the conclusion given in [1] that ”The proper inference from this experiment is
that the Coulomb interaction cannot be considered as so called ’instantaneous
action at a distance’ ”( i.e. the scalar potential in the Coulomb gauge). Actually,
since we are only able to measure the EM ﬁelds experimentally, we cannot draw
any conclusions about the speed of propagation of the scalar potential, if two
solutions for the scalar and vector potentials ϕ(u1), A(u1) and ϕ(u2), A(u2),
where ui is determined by the choice of gauge, yield identical expressions for
the electric ﬁeld.

However, the results of the experiment described in [1] suggest that these
expressions are not identical. So, one can question whether or not diﬀerent
gauges in electrodynamics are actually equivalent. In this paper, we consider
this problem. Because existing studies of the equivalence of the gauges have
dealt with the Coulomb and Lorentz gauges, we will focus our analysis on these
gauges as well.

The plan of this paper is as follows.

In section 2, we will calculate the
electric ﬁeld in both gauges for the simplest model of the experimental setup of
[1]. Also we will show that these calculations must be made by means of the
potentials but cannot be done by using the wave equation for the E ﬁeld derived
from the Maxwell equations directly, i.e. without introducing the potentials.
Some explanation of the results of the Sec. 2 is given in the sections 3 and 4
where we will review the derivation of the equivalence of the expressions for the
electric ﬁeld calculated in both gauges and then we will show at what point
this derivation is wrong, i.e.
the diﬀerence in the shapes of the elementary
classical charges calculated in both gauges is neglected. This diﬀerence follows
unambiguously from the expressions for the scalar potential in the Coulomb and
Lorentz gauges. Because its motion causes a change in the shape of the charge,
since the size of the charge contracts along its direction of motion, one would
expect that the greatest diﬀerence in the gauges should occur in this direction
as well. Finally, in section 5, we will draw some conclusion about what physical
eﬀect is responsible for the diﬀerence in the gauges.

2. An example of diﬀerence between the electric ﬁeld calculated in
two gauges.

It is quite impossible to process complete calculations of the E ﬁeld
detected by the antenna in the experiment of [1]. So for analysis of the ﬁelds
in this system we should simplify the latter but in such a way that its inherent
features will be held. Therefore, we consider the following simpliﬁcation of the
real experiment: a single charge moving at the straight line which corresponds
to the axis of symmetry of the experimental installation. We assume too that
this charge moves uniformly which allows us to consider the most general case;
i.e., when the properties of the system do not depend on their initial conditions,
and, therefore, when choosing the advanced and retarded solutions as well.

Now we state the question: is it possible that the longitudinal component of
the E ﬁeld calculated in diﬀerent gauges has diﬀerent values?. Similar calcula-
tions have not been made in [1] so we wish to make up this gap.

It should be noted that all formulas for calculations of the longitudinal ﬁelds
of the moving charge (in near non-radiative zone) are made for the Lorentz
gauge. So while calculating the electric ﬁeld in the Coulomb gauge, we use the
method given in [5].

Thus, the equation for the vector potential in the Coulomb gauge is (the Eq.

6.46 of [2])

2AC −

Because of independence of the current JC and the scalar potential ϕ on
each other, we are able to express the quantity AC in terms of the sum of two
quantities; the ﬁrst of which is determined by one wave equation and the second
from the other wave equation, i.e.

AC = AL + Aϕ

One can see from the Eq. 2.2 that AL is the vector potential in the Lorentz
gauge. Now we ﬁnd the diﬀerence between the electric ﬁelds calculated in the
Coulomb EC and Lorentz EL gauges

(2.4)

Here we take into account that, as it will be shown in the Sec. 4, the
charges have diﬀerent shapes in the Coulomb and Lorentz gauges so the current
densities JC and JL are diﬀerent as well. But this diﬀerence is asymptotically
equal to zero (Appendix I), so we omit third and fourth terms of rhs of the
above equation from further consideration.

We use Eq. 2.4 to calculate the diﬀerence between the electric ﬁelds in the

system deﬁned above, i.e.
the charge moves uniformly along the X -axis and the detector of the electric
ﬁeld is on this axis as well.

X ——————–q → —————-Det——————————-
The ﬁrst term on the rhs of Eq. 2.4 is the diﬀerence between the retarded
and instantaneous scalar potentials. The magnitude of the retarded potential
of a uniformly moving point charge (if we measure this quantity at the axis of
motion of the charge) is

ϕL = 1/ |x − vt|

(2.5)

Eq. 2.5 is the reduced form of Eq. 21.39 in [6] for y = 0, z = 0 , and the
‘current’ time, but not in terms of the retarded time. Eq. 2.5 coincides with
the expression for the Coulomb potential of the charge, when the charge is at
the point x − vt, where t is an instantaneous (’current’) time. Therefore, the
sum in the brackets on the rhs of Eq. 2.4 is equal to zero. For the electric ﬁelds
calculated in the Coulomb and Lorentz gauges to be equivalent, it is necessary

3

that the second term on the rhs of the Eq. 2.4 be equal to zero. But this is
impossible if the terms, which are proportional to the gradients of the scalar
potentials, eliminate each other. One term on the rhs of the Eq. 2.4 still remains
and it can be expressed in terms of the equation

EC − EL =

∂Aϕ
c∂t

(2.6)

where Aϕ is the solution of the wave equation with source ∇[∂ϕC /c∂t].

To obtain solution of the Eq. 2.6, we will use the Lorentz procedure of
solving the wave equation ([7] Ch 18.3); we do not refer to the original work of
Lorentz because he ﬁnds the solution for the ﬁelds and not the potentials). In
the Coulomb gauge, the distributed ’longitudinal current’ (the term ∇[∂ϕC /c∂t]
instantaneously follows the charge creating this current, therefore the Lorentz
transformation of the coordinates reduces a static case and, as a result, calcu-
lating the diﬀerence in the ﬁelds belonging to diﬀerent gauges reduces to solving
a three dimensional integral.

Thus, the wave equation for Aϕ is

∂ϕC (x − vt, y, z)

(2.7)

where we take into account that the rhs of the Eq. 2.7 is formed from the
derivatives of scalar potential in the Coulomb gauge, where this potential ‘in-
stantaneously’ follows the motion of the charge so that the x and t variables
enter in the rhs of the Eq. 2.7 in terms of the combination (x − vt).

Because the EM ﬁelds created by uniformly moving source must move with
this source too, the time and spatial derivatives are not independent of each
other, but are linked by the relation (the Eq. 18.10 of [7])

(2.8)

where x′ = x−vt. Since the rhs of Eq. 2.8 does not depend on time, the lhs does
not depend on time either, which means that Eq. 2.8 reduces to the Poisson
equation in elliptic coordinates. By changing the variables x′/
c2 = χ ,
Eq. 2.8 reduces to the ordinary Poisson equation with the rhs containing a
spatially distributed source. Its solution is:

Inserting the expression for Aϕ,X (Eq. 2.9) into Eq. 2.6, we ﬁnally obtain

One can easily see that because the integrand is not a symmetric expression,
the integral over the whole space is not equal to zero (we do not ﬁnish the
calculation of this integral because its concrete form is not essential). Therefore,
we ﬁnd that the ﬁeld is actually diﬀerent in the diﬀerent gauges.

Here, one can expect an objection that because the E ﬁeld can be calculated
directly from Maxwell equations, the analysis of the diﬀerence in the E ﬁelds
calculated in both gauges loses its sense. However, it is not so. We show that
for this case, i.e. the case of longitudinal ﬁelds, it is impossible to obtain the
solution for the E ﬁeld without using the EM potentials.

To avoid any cumbersome calculations which can be caused by necessity
to describe radiation processes, we consider simplest electrodynamical system
which one is given above, i.e. the charge moves uniformly along the X axis. In
description of this system, we will be able to obtain the expressions for the ﬁeld
in explicit form which allows to compare the solutions for the E ﬁeld obtained
in two ways.

Firstly, we consider derivation of direct, i.e. made without introducing the
potentials, wave equation (DWE) for E ﬁeld. Using two Maxwell equations
(second and fourth Eqs. 6.28 of [2])

Taking the curl of Eq. 2.10 and partial time derivative, divided by c, of Eq.

2.11, we obtain

Now we use the Eq. 14 for calculation of the electric ﬁelds created by the

Since the wave operator −∇

(2.15)

where r is the radius vector of the point of detection of the ﬁelds and note ‘ret ’
means that the function (∂ρ/∂x′) should be calculated at retarded time.

To calculate the integral 2.15 in the limit of point charge, we should make

integration by parts of the rhs of the above equation.

Now, while calculating the integral 2.16, we should take into account that the
charge is a non-point object; so after going in integration over the volume oc-
cupated by the elementary charge to integration over the charge itself, we have
(all details of transition from dr′ integration to de integration are given in Ch.
18.1 of [7])

(2.17)

As a result, we obtain

Ex,ρ(r, t) =

We will not calulate transversal terms because to show incorrectness of the
DWE solutions, it is suﬃcient to obtain for the only component of the E ﬁeld
that this component obtained from the DWE and from the LW potential is
diﬀerent.

However, the electric ﬁeld is created not only by the charge but by the
current density too. So we take into account the solution of Eq. 2.14a. One
can see that the rhs of Eq. 2.14a −
(∂jx/∂t) can be changed by the
4πv2/c2
(∂ρ/∂x) in case of uniformly moving charge. So the total Ex

Obviously, Eqs. 2.18 and 2.19 are diﬀerent. So if we assume that the Eq. 2.18
is correct we must assume that the Eq. 2.19 is incorrect. However, the Eq.
2.19 is a part of general formula for the E ﬁelds of arbitrary moving charge. So
our assumption will require radical revising the basic formulas of the classical
electrodynamics, therefore, we must conclude that the DWE for the electric ﬁeld
gives incorrect result.

But this strange result of diﬀerence in the E ﬁelds calculated via the poten-
tials but in diﬀerent gauges must be explaned. So one can suggest that there is
a some error in the proof of equivalence of the electrodynamical gauges. Below
we will show that this suggestion has some ground but before we review existing
proof of this equivalence within the classical electrodynamics.

3. Derivation of the expressions for the E ﬁeld calculated in both
gauges.

One can assume that a suﬃcient condition of equivalence for both gauges
is the identical form of the expressions for the electric ﬁeld calculated by both
these gauges. Proof of this is well represented in the scientiﬁc literature (see [3],
[2] 2nd and 3rd editions, and [5]). In spite of this, we recall that these derivations
miss a critical point. Although our derivation does not coincide completely to
those given in [3], [2], [5], we keep the basic ideas used in the cited works.

Thus, we consider the wave equations for the vector and scalar potentials
in the Coulomb and Lorentz gauges, respectively. The wave equations for the
vector potential in the Coulomb (for AC ) and Lorentz (for AL) gauges are (Eqs.
3 and 6 of [5], where we use the same notation used in [5]):

The corresponding equations for the scalar potential in the Coulomb (for

Using the above two equations, we take their diﬀerence and ﬁnd that the
term on the rhs of the Eqs. 3.4 and 3.5, corresponding to the charge density, is
eliminated. However, another term appears, which corresponds to the second
time derivative of ϕL:

Now we transform Eqs. 3.3 and 3.6 in such a way that their rhs’ will have
the identical form. To do it, we apply the gradient operator to Eq. 3.6 and
operator [∂../c∂t] to Eq. 3.3. As a result, we ﬁnd, after commuting the gradient
and the operator [∂../c∂t] with the wave operator, that

which are similar to Eqs. 24 and 25 of [5]. From Equations (3.7) and (3.8),
both ∇(ϕL − ϕC ) and ∂(AC − AL)/c∂t satisfy the same diﬀerential equation.
Therefore,

∇(ϕL − ϕC ) =

∂(AC − AL)
c∂t

(3.9)

Transforming Eq. 3.9 and using the deﬁnition for the electric ﬁeld, we have

EC = −∇ϕC −

(3.10)

∂AC

∂AL

i.e. the equivalence of the expressions for the E ﬁeld in both gauges is proven.
We note that Eq. 3.10 is a constructive method for calculatimg the E ﬁeld
in the Coulomb gauge [5]: scalar Coulomb potential, entering in Eq. 3.10, is
calculated as a solution of the Poisson equation and that part of the E ﬁeld
created by the vector potential is determined by using the following form of Eq.
3.10

∂AC

(3.11)

Thus, the total electric ﬁeld is presented as a superposition of rotational and
irrotational components which is important for analysis of the ﬁelds near the
radiator [5]. Equivalence of the magnetic ﬁeld in both gauges follow from the
equation

∇ × AC = ∇ × AL

since AL diﬀers from AC by only the gradient of some scalar function.

4. Analysis of the derivation presented in the Sec. 3.

It is necessary to say that despite the obviousness of the proof presented
above, it contains a few mistakes. First, to prove equivalence in a mathemati-
cally strict way, one must analyze the expressions for the electric ﬁelds and not
the diﬀerential equations for these ﬁelds. If one focuses on analysis of the latter,
one must take into account the initial and boundary conditions, because solu-
tions of identical equations, but for diﬀerent boundary and initial conditions,
are diﬀerent. This point is missed in the existing proof.

The second missing point is in the procedure of proof itself, i.e. when rhs
of equations 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 3.5 is eliminated, one does not consider that
the functions describing the current and charge densities in the Coulomb and
Lorentz gauges are diﬀerent. This fact can be established by using the idea of
Lorentz to ﬁnd that the sizes of uniformly moving charge, which contract along
their direction of motion (this procedure developed by Lorentz is described with
more clarity in [8]). Lorentz found that the equipotential surfaces of the scalar

9

Liennard-Wiechert potential, expressed in terms of the coordinates of the frame
of reference where it is assumed that the observer is at rest and the charge is
moving, i.e. ϕ(r, t) = const, are ellipsoids of rotation contract along the axis
of motion of the charge. Since, as Lorentz concluded, the surface of the charge
is deﬁned to be an equipotential surface, this surface must have an ellipsoidal
shape in this frame too.

Following Lorentz’s procedure, we will show that the functions ρ and J, de-
scribing the charge and current densities of the elementary charge, are diﬀerent
in these gauges. But ﬁrst, we must deﬁne what an elementary charge in the
classical electrodynamics is.

It is a widespread opinion in classical electrodynamics, that we are able
to assume point charges only. At least, any calculations of electrodynamical
quantities cannot be based on a speciﬁc distribution of the charge inside the
electron. However, from a physical point of view, it is impossible to treat the
classical electron as a point particle because it leads to divergences in the theory
(runaway solutions, etc., see, for example, [9]). Therefore, according to the
recommendations given in [7] (beginning of Ch. 18.1), we assume that the
radius of classical charge is ﬁnite and we associate a physical meaning to those
properties of the electrodynamical system which do not depend on the radius
of the charge.

Thus, we have Statement I:

A surface of the elementary charge is the surface for which the condition

ϕ(x0, y0, z0) = const

(4.1)

is fulﬁlled
(where, x0, y0, z0 are the coordinates of the surface of the charge). So, this
surface is an equipotential surface. We note that for a moving charge, the lines
of E ﬁeld are not normal to the equipotential surface ( Eq. 4.1), since we must
take into account not only the term

but rather the entire expression

E = −∇ϕ

E = −∇ϕ −

∂A
c∂t

(4.2)

Due to the last term in Eq. 4.2, the E ﬁeld lines are no longer normal to the ϕ
surfaces.

For the Lorentz gauge, it is proven in [7], and for the Coulomb gauge, we
prove it in the Appendix II. We emphasize that the results presented Appendix
II, i.e. the spherical shape of a moving charge in the Coulomb gauge changes,
which contradicts to relativistic theory because according to the latter, any
charge should contract. But our ’strange result’ is caused by using the Coulomb
gauge which is essentially non-relativistic so some quantities calculated in this
gauge have no relativistic properties.

10

It is necessary to point out that the ‘relativistic suggestion’ that a moving
charge in the Coulomb gauge must contract also cannot be checked experimen-
tally. It results from the following:
1. the shape of the surface of the charge can be determined by measureing the
ﬁelds or by calculating the potentials since direct measurement (not via ﬁeld
quantities) is impossible (there is no ’charge-charge’ interaction);
2. because the lines of E ﬁeld are not normal to the surface of the moving
charge, one cannot use direct measurement of the EM ﬁelds to reconstruct the
shape of the surface.

So the only way to obtain information about the shape of this surface is to
do it via calculation of the ϕ potential, as it has been made by Lorentz, and we
will using his method.

Now we have Statement II

for both gauges, the equipotential surfaces, i.e. those ones meeting the condition

ϕ(r, t) = const

for diﬀerent r and given instant t are the concentric surfaces converging to the
limiting point, which is the center of the elementary charge.
For the Coulomb gauge this Statement follows from rotational symmetry of the
expression for the scalar potential (Eq. 6.45 of [2]) and for the Lorentz gauge, it
follows from the Eq. 18.20, but in the latter case, we must calculate the shapes
of the surfaces separately when the point of observation is outside the charge
and when this point is inside the elementary charge.

It follows from the Statement II that

Consequence I:
While r → 0 the set ϕ(r, t) = const forms a geometric sequence (the sequence
of converging surfaces).
Consequence II:
For diﬀerent gauges, these surfaces are diﬀerent and for any r

where C1 and C2 are constants; and for any C1 and C2

ϕC (r, t) = C1

ϕL(r, t) = C2

ϕC (r, t) 6= ϕL(r, t)

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

The Eq. 4.5 can be easily proven. Because ϕC (r, t) and ϕL(r, t) are solutions
of diﬀerent equations (Eqs. 3.4 and 3.5), they must be diﬀerent too. Strictly
speaking, the intersection of the two surfaces the Eqs. 4.3 and 4.4, yields some
curve but the coincidence of these surfaces is never possible.
Consequence III:
For all gauges, the limiting point of converging sequences is unique, it is the
point of center of the elementary charge

Now we choose the parameter R0 as a ’radius’ of moving elementary charge.
(x0)2 + (y0)2 + (z0)2, and in the Lorentz gauge
In the Coulomb gauge, RC,0 =
(x0)2/ (1 − v2/c2) + (y0)2 + (z0)2, where x0... are deﬁned above. Ac-
RL,0 =
tually, ϕL depends on the coordinates x0... not via RL,0 but rahter via some
other combination of the these variables, but since this speciﬁc dependence is
not important for our procedure, we schematically write this dependence via
RL,0. We do not know the exact values for RC,0 and RL,0, we only know that
both R0 → 0 but both R0 6= 0, which corresponds to the deﬁnition for the
radius of the elementary charge given in [7].

It follows from Statement I that the shape of the charge in the Coulomb

gauge is described by

and the shape of the charge in the Lorentz gauge is described by

ϕC (RC,0, t) = C3

ϕL(RL,0, t) = C4

where C3 and C4 are some constants; i.e. Eq. 4.6 belongs to the sequence in
Eq. 4.3 and Eq. 4.7 to the sequence in Eq. 4.4, respectively. However, due to
the inequality in Eq. 4.5, the equation

ϕC (RC,0, t) = ϕL(RL,0, t)

cannot be fulﬁlled for any RC,0 and RL,0. Physically it means that the shapes of
the charge in diﬀerent gauges are diﬀerent too and, therefore, ρL(r) and ρC (r)
are not identical and the mathematical operation of subtracting one function
from the other yields a non-zero result. Because the above proof does not depend
on speciﬁc values of R0, it is correct in the limit of a point charge too.

A further consideration is trivial. Taking into account that the functions J

and ρ are diﬀerent in diﬀerent gauges, we obtain

is satisﬁed. But in general, this is not the case and for uniformly moving charge,
the lhs of the Eq 4.14 reduces to

(1 − v2/c2)∇(ρC − ρL)

(4.15)

It seems, however, that there is one more way to prove the equivalence of
the expressions for the electric ﬁeld, because the non-zero term on the rhs of
the wave equation is not equal to zero only in the area occupied by the charge
itself. So we can expect that, after integration of the wave equation, the non-
compensated term in Eq. 4.15 will tend to zero, while receding the point of
observation from the charge.

It is expressed in explicit form as (for simplicity we consider the case of
a uniformly moving charge, where all details of the calculations are given in
Appendix I):

EC (R) − EL(R) = 4π(1 − v2/c2)

∇r[ρC (r) − ρL(r)]
|R − r|

dr

Z

(4.16)

where the integral is calculated for the retarded time. Since the integral of the
charge density over the whole space is equal to the total charge in both gauges,
it is easy to show that the above expression rapidly tends to zero when R >> a,
where a is the radius of the elementary classical charge (Appendix I), i.e. the
expressions for the electric ﬁeld are asymptotically equivalent in both gauges,
and if one takes into account the radius of the classical charge, the limiting area
of integration in the Eq. 4.16 should be set to zero, the gauges are equivalent
in classical electrodynamics.

But one must take into account that the term −[∂2ϕC /c2∂t2] is artiﬁcially
added to the rhs and lhs of the wave equation ( Eq. 3.4). Since this term is added
to the both the right and the left sides of the equations, it is mathematically
correct. But if this term is used on the lhs of the equation to construct the
Green’s function and the same term in the rhs of the equation is used as a source
for the Green’s function, which means that the lhs and rhs of the equation are
being treated diﬀerently, it is absolutely incorrect. As a consequence of this
incorrect procedure, it leads to a diﬀerence in the expressions for the calculated
ﬁelds.

5. Conclusion.

13

It would be interesting to do an analysis as to why such a microscopic
eﬀect as the changing the shape of electric charge (for a uniformly moving elec-
tron, its surface becomes elliptical in the Lorentz gauge and remains spherical in
the Coulomb gauge) causes a macroscopic eﬀect (diﬀerence in the ﬁelds). It is
especially strange since formally we are able to decrease the radius of the charge
to zero. So from our point of view, the macroscopic eﬀect is not caused by the
changing shape of the elementary classical charge, but rather by properties of
the aether: ﬁniteness (of inﬁniteness) of the speed of the scalar EM interaction
determines the magnitude of both the EM ﬁelds and the shape of the charge
creating these ﬁelds.

Thus, just the act of deﬁning the speed of propagation of the scalar EM
interaction in a medium (aether or vacuum) deﬁnes the correct gauge for this
system, as well as the shape of the elementary classical charge. Because we
have an example of the reverse inﬂuence of the medium on the charge (in the
case of uniform motion of the charge we have some equilibrium process for
converging and diverging EM waves), this inﬂuence unambiguously determines
the equilibrium shape of the moving charge. The mechanism by which the
medium inﬂuences the charge is still unexplained, but within the framework of
this eﬀort, it is impossible to ﬁnd an explanation. It should be noted that in
relativistic theory, the term ’medium’ is not used, so we use the term ‘aether’
but we do not make any claims about its reality.

It would be noted that one of the aims of this work is to turn the scientiﬁc
community’s attention to the fact that until now, some problems of electrody-
namics, which seemed to be absolutely irrefutable, cannot be conclusively solved.
So it would be interesting to re-examine some of the ideas of Whittaker([10],
also see [11]), especially regarding the formation of the Coulomb (or scalar) po-
tential from convergent and divergent EM waves. Finally, the diﬀerence in the
properties of the scalar potential calculated in the Coulomb and Lorentz gauges
gives diﬀerences for all other ﬁeld quantities.

Thus, the ﬁnal conclusion of this work is that in classical electrodynamics,
the uniqueness of the description of some systems requires setting not only the
initial and boundary conditions but also the speed of propagation of the scalar
potential as well, where the latter unambiguously determines the gauge which
we must use while obtaining solutions for the EM ﬁelds.

Appendix II. Obtaining of the shape of the elementary charge in the
Coulomb gauge.

15

Here we analyze the following statement:

if the moving charge acquires a
shape of contracted ellipsoid in the Lorentz gauge, will we observe the same eﬀect
for the moving charge in the Coulomb gauge. It seems it must be so because
any physical quantity must transform according to the Lorentz transformations
while going from one inertial frame to the other one. But without possibility
to verify experimentally how the shape of the charge actually changes, in the
given gauge, the above statement can be treated only as assumption.

However, a problem is just in this experimental veriﬁcation since we are
not able to reconstruct the shape of the elementary charge directly from the
experimental data, i.e. from measured EM ﬁelds.

• For the moving charge, the lines of the E ﬁeld are not normal to the surface,
which these lines outcome from (the example of such a conﬁguration of
the lines of the E ﬁeld and the moving charge is given in the Fig. 26.4 of
[6]), so we cannot use geometric methods

• Formally the shape of the uniformly moving charge may be determined as a
solution of the integral equation for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, where
the function r is a source for the Green function, but because we cannot
ﬁx the radius of the elementary classical charge, the problem cannot have
unambiguous solution.

It follows from the pp. 1 and 2, that the only way to determine the shape
of the elementary charge is after equipotential surfaces of ϕ, i.e. the way used
by Lorentz. One can object that because the EM potentials are treated, within
the classical electrodynamics, as some abstract but not physical quantities, un-
ambiguous determination of the shape of the charge via the scalar potential is
impossible. However, in the above problem, just the properties of the EM po-
tentials are under investigation, therefore, for us it is not so important what is
an origin of the potentials. But what is important is the fact that ϕ and A are
unambiguously deﬁned after the EM ﬁelds and the condition on a type of the
gauge. Therefore, the shape of the charge will be determined unambiguously
too because there is no ambiguity in the gauge condition.

Now we show by reductio ad absurdum that the uniformly moving elemen-
tary charge cannot have, in the Coulomb gauge, a shape of contracted ellipsoid.
Thus, in the frame with the charge at rest, the Poisson equation for the elemen-
tary charge is (in Gauss units)

(AII.2)

We don’t know what is the shape of the uniformly moving elementary charge
but we exactly know the shape of the charge while it is at rest. Due to rotational

symmetry, its shape must be spherical.
For the ’point-like’ charge, i.e. for R′ >> r′ the Eq. AII.2 reduces to

′
ϕ

(R′

) =

R′

(AII.3)

Now we go to the second frame where the charge moves uniformly. According
to the Lorentz transformations, the function ρ must transform and the shape of
the elementary charge becomes elliptic.

But when we apply the Lorentz transformation to the physical quantities,
even they are treated as auxiliary ones, in some frame, we must transform
all quantities of this frame. So in the Eqs. AII.1, AII.2 and AII.3, we must
transform not only the potentials and the charge densities but the coordinates
too.
As a result, we have

′
ϕ

(R) =

q
(x − vt)2 + (1 − v2/c2)(y2 + z2)

But this solution does not coincide to well known solution for the scalar given
in [2] (Eq. 6.45).

ϕ(R) =

ρ(x, y, z, t)

that is correct for any law of motion of the charge. So our suggestion about
the Lorentz contraction of moving elementary charge leads to incorrect expres-
sion for the ϕ potentials and, therefore, any analysis of the equivalence of the
Coulomb and Lorentz gauges, which is presented in Refs. 2, 3 and 4 too, loses
its signiﬁcance.
Thus, we are not able to conclude that the shape of the moving charge in the
Coulomb gauge is elliptic.

At the end, we prove that in the Coulomb gauge, the uniformly moving

charge has spherical shape.

It is easily to see that the equation for the scalar potential in the Coulomb
gauge obeys the ’Lorentz transformations’ in the limiting case when the speed
of the scalar EM interaction tends to inﬁnity (c → ∞) so the Lorentz transfor-
mations reduce to

′
x

= (x − vt) /

1 − v2/c2 → x − vt

Then the formula for transformation of the charge density becomes

′

ρ

= ρ/

1 − v2/c2 → ρ

and the spherical shape of the uniformly moving charge remains to be spherical
too

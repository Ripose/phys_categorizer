A general algorithm is presented for estimating the nonlinear instability threshold, σc, for subcrit-
ical transitions in systems where the linearized dynamics is signiﬁcantly non-normal (i.e. subcritical
bifurcations of Takens-Bogdanov type). The N -dimensional degenerate node is presented as an
example. The predictions are then compared to numerical studies with excellent agreement.

PACS numbers: 47.20.Ky, 47.20.Ft, 47.27.Cn

Consider a nonlinear dynamical system whose dynamics in the vicinity of a stable equilibrium is non-normal at
linear order. (A matrix or linear operator, L, is non-normal if L†L 6= LL† with L† the adjoint.) In the subcritical
case, nonlinearity makes the equilibrium unstable to ﬁnite-amplitude perturbations. The goal is to estimate the size
of the smallest impulse needed to drive the system unstable, denoted σc. Non-normality implies that the eigenvectors
of L are not orthogonal. In the extreme case of degeneracy two, or more, of the eigenvectors can become parallel
leading to non-diagonalizability of the operator (see, for example, [1] for a discussion of the ﬁnite dimensional case).
A prototypical example in two dimensions is that studied by Takens [2] and Bogdanov [3](here the ˙x1 = dx1/dt etc.):

with f1 and f2 nonlinear functions of their arguments. In a slight abuse of terminology, in the following discussion we
will use the terms ‘Takens-Bogdanov bifurcations’ and ‘non-normal transitions’ interchangeably. Hence, a ‘Takens-
Bogdanov bifurcation’ or a ‘non-normal transition’ here shall mean any system where the linearized dynamics is
non-normal and the non-normality produces important eﬀects.

The notion that non-normality might be physically important was ﬁrst suggested by Orr [4] in an attempt to
explain the failure of standard linear stability analysis to predict the observed critical Reynold’s number for the
laminar/turbulent transition in some shear ﬂows. This conjecture has been revived recently (see [5–9] for pro and [10]
for con). Such degenerate transitions occur in other physical models as well. For example they arise in aeroelastic
models [11], and stall models for turbines [12]. For a discussion of other physical applications the interested reader is
referred to Chapter 7 of the most recent edition of [13]. The related degenerate Hopf is discussed in [14].

Much of the work cited above deals with bifurcations of low-dimensional models derived from more primitive
equations (for example Navier-Stokes) by Galerkin projection. When such projections exhibit degeneracies one must
be careful about the physical interpretation. Unless one can demonstrate that the behavior of interest is robust under
perturbation then it is most likely that the degeneracy is a mathematical pathology with little physical importance.
Such perturbations come in many varieties, with two of most important being: a) perturbations of the equations
themselves (meaning, for example, the degeneracy is not exact), and b) noise driving, both additive and multiplicative.
Such noise might represent, for example, coupling to the environment or to degrees of freedom which have been
projected out by the Galerkin procedure. In this letter we consider perturbations of type a). The additive noise
response of Takens-Bogdanov systems will be discussed elsewhere [15].

A key question from a physical point of view is: What robust observable characteristics, if any, distinguish ‘non-

normal’ transitions from ‘normal’ ones?

Baggett and Trefethen [6] have shown numerically that a range of low-dimensional non-normal systems exhibit
anomalous scaling behavior at subcritical transitions: the rate at which σc ↓ 0 as the threshold for linear instability is

approached diﬀers markedly from that of normal systems. This is summarized by the scaling law σc ∼ ǫγ with ǫ the
linear stability parameter. (Here ǫ is used instead of the inverse Reynolds’ number, 1/R. The threshold is ǫ = 0 with
ǫ > 0 stable.) For normal transitions γ is generically unity, while for non-normal transitions γ can be greater than
unity. Baggett has also shown that it is possible to derive the anomalous scaling exponent in a simple 2-dimensional
case [16].

The purpose of this letter is to provide a general algorithm for computing the scaling exponents and to illustrate the
geometric origin of the anomalous scaling behavior. The basic logic parallels that of threshold estimation for normal
subcritical systems:

First, at the linear instability threshold (ǫ = 0), a normal form analysis [13] identiﬁes nonlinear terms which cannot
transformed to higher nonlinear order – by coordinate transformations. These are called resonant

be removed – i.e.
nonlinear terms. Here, the linear term is assumed to be exactly degenerate and non-diagonalizable.

Second, backing away from the linear threshold (ǫ > 0), an asymptotic analysis is performed on the resonant
nonlinear terms to determine which of them dominate. Here, the degeneracy could be weakly broken as well. The
physical intuition is that the most important nonlinear terms are both resonant (in the normal form) and dominant
(in the asymptotic limit of ǫ ↓ 0). As will be shown, for the 2-dimensional degenerate node this combined normal
form/asymptotic balance method identiﬁes the same dominant nonlinear term as reported by Takens [2]. Takens,
however, used the technique of topological blowup to identify the dominant nonlinear term, requiring three blowups in
sequence before the dominant term was revealed [13].

While the method reported here is quite general, it is illustrated on an N -dimensional degenerate node because this
is relatively simple. The extension to general N is non-trivial and is necessary for physical applications where more
than 2 degrees of freedom may be near threshold. To our knowledge, the topological blowup analysis of Takens has
not been extended to higher dimensions.

Before starting the analysis, we state our main conclusion: the anomalous scaling behavior of non-normal transitions
is determined purely by an appropriate balance between the dominant linear and nonlinear eﬀects, as identiﬁed by
the normal form/asymptotic balance analysis. The new element in the non-normal balance is a geometric relation,
summarized by the triangle relation, Figure (1). We turn now to the presentation of the algorithm. We consider the
discrete-time map as well as the continuous-time ﬂow to illustrate the simplicity of the result. The ﬂow is gotten by
an appropriate limit of the map.

FIG. 1. The asymptotic scaling relation between x1s and σc is summarized by the triangle relation of this ﬁgure. The
triangle OSA is formed by the node (O), the saddle (S) and the point of closest approach of the basin boundary to the node
(which lies in the immediate neighborhood of (A)). The shape of this triangle is determined by the linear ampliﬁcation factor
(8): x1s/σc : |x1|max/σ0.

Consider the discrete-time dynamical system:

xj(m + 1) = Fj (x(m); p)

m = 0, 1, 2 . . .

where x, F ∈ ℜN , F is a smooth nonlinear function of x and p is a control parameter. Suppose F has a ﬁxed point
x∗(p) which we take to be the origin. Expanding to ﬁrst order:

with A ≡ ∇F |x=0. We take A to be of the form:

All oﬀ-diagonal terms (except α) are zero. The eigenvalue λ is real and 0 < λ ≤ 1. The coupling constant, α, is
assumed to be real and positive. More general A will be treated in a longer paper.

The map (3) can be considered an Euler integrator for the ﬂow ˙x = (A − I)x if we take λ − 1 ∼ δt and α ∼ δt, with
δt the step-size. Hence, the discrete-time node will have the same scalings as the related ﬂow. In fact, although the
scaling exponent (14) is developed using maps, the numerical tests (Figure (2)) were all performed using ﬂows. The
results are in complete agreement.

FIG. 2. The scaling exponents γ(N, n) are tested for various combinations of N (the dimension of the dynamics) and n (the
leading order nonlinearity). The symbols are the numerical results which were generated using a Bulirsch-Stoer method [17]
and the lines are the predicted scalings. The results are labeled as (N, n, γ).

Consider the linear impulse response. The analysis for the ﬂow is straightforward as one is dealing with an N -
dimensional system of equations with constant coeﬃcients. Hence x(t) = exp(At)x0. The degeneracy of A implies
that the components of x(t) will not be simple exponents in t, but of the form tne−γt for some γ. This result can
be found in any undergraduate text on diﬀerential equations. The calculation for the discrete-time map is more
challenging:

The system is given a random initial kick at m = 0 with correlation matrix: < x0xT

0I and I the N × N
identity matrix. At the mth time step x(m) = Amx0. If A is banded, then so is Am, hence one need only calculate
the last column, [Am]jN :

where we have suppressed the N -dependent prefactor. This result is the ampliﬁcation factor of the linear transients
(note that it is trivially valid if N = 1).

Now consider the eﬀects of nonlinearity, and treat ﬁrst the N = 2 case for simplicity. We assume only that
the nonlinear terms are smooth. To study generic behavior one casts the given problem into its simplest form by
performing smooth and invertible coordinate transformations to eliminate as many nonlinear terms as possible. The
normal form analysis identiﬁes those terms which cannot be eliminated. This analysis is done for ǫ = 0, then ǫ > 0
reintroduced for the asymptotic balance estimates to follow. For a detailed discussion of the Takens-Bogdanov normal
form analysis, the interested reader is refered to Chapter 7 of [13].

To quadratic order, the normal form for the N = 2 degenerate node is

with a2 and b2 arbitrary coeﬃcients. If these quadratic terms do not appear, then one must go to higher order (all
other quadratic terms can be pushed to higher order by changing coordinates). At nth order one ﬁnds

For concreteness assume an and bn are positive (or 0). This insures the system is subcritical. Consider n = 2:
solving (9) for the position of the saddle (ﬁnd the second root of x′ = x): ǫx1s = αx2s;
1s.
There are two simple cases:

ǫx2s = a2x1sx2s + b2x2

(I): a2 = 0, b2 ∼ O(1); x1s = ǫ2/αb2, x2s = (ǫ/α)x1s.

(II): a2 ∼ O(1), b2 = 0;

x1s = ǫ/2a2, x2s = 0.

Rescaling via x1s ≡ ǫ2 ˜x1s and x2s ≡ ǫ3 ˜x2s reveals that the b2 terms dominates. Hence, the scaling for Case I should
be seen most often for quadratically nonlinear systems, while that of Case II requires special conditions (the smallness
of b2 to at least O(ǫ)). (N.B. As mentioned earlier, this identiﬁcation of b2 as the dominant term agrees with the
topological blowup analysis of Takens [2,13]. The approach we describe in this letter diﬀers from a blowup analysis in
that we are considering asymptotic balances in the neighborhood of the bifurcation (ǫ > 0) while the blowup analysis
is done at the bifurcation (ǫ = 0).)
At cubic order, it is the b3x3

1 term driving x2 which dominates. This behavior holds for general nth-order non-
linearities, which allows us to state: if the ﬁrst nonlinearities appear at order n, and bn > 0 and ∼ O(1), then the

position of the saddle is given by ǫx1s ∼ αx2s;

ǫx2s ∼ bnxn

1s. This implies x1s ∼

x2s ∼

bn

(cid:16)
In higher dimensions (N > 2), the normal form analysis reveals that new resonances become possible (with one new
resonance appearing for each increment N → N + 1). Most importantly, the bnxn
1 term will always resonantly drive
xN . Asymptotic estimates show that if bn > 0 and ∼ O(1) this term will be dominant. The position of the saddle is:

(cid:17)

(cid:1)

1/(n−1)

which gives

ǫx1s ∼ αx2s; . . . ǫxkx ∼ αxk+1; . . . ǫxN s ∼ bnxn
1s,

Note that this estimate is also valid in the normal case where, because the linear term is diagonalizable, N is eﬀectively
1.

We now turn to the estimate of the subcritical threshold: as ǫ ↓ 0, how far is the basin boundary from the degenerate
node? Eq.(12) gives the distance to the basin boundary along the stable manifold of the node. If this were a normal

saddle-node bifurcation, x1s would typically give a good estimate of the distance of closest approach of the basin
boundary. However, the non-normal linear behavior forces the basin boundary to form an acute angle with the stable
manifold of the node, hence it will lie very close to the node in directions transverse to the stable manifold. This is
summarized by the triangle relation of Figure (1). The linear response determines the shape of the triangle and relates
|x1|max ∼ (α/ǫ)N −1σ0. If |x1|max ∼ |x|1s, then this initial
|x1|max to an initial impulse xN 0 ∼ σ0 via Eq. (8), i.e.
perturbation will have crossed the basin boundary. Therefore, this balance determines the threshold for instabilities
due to ﬁnite perturbations and gives as a threshold estimate:

Eq.(14) is our primary result. We note that this is also valid for normal (N = 1) case.

Table I summarizes the scaling exponents, γ, for several N and n. These were tested numerically with ﬂows. The
ﬂows have linear dynamics ˙x = Ax with A of the form (4) and λ replaced by −ǫ. The models all have the dominant

In summary, we have shown that it is possible to systematically evaluate the importance of various nonlinear eﬀects
on non-normal transitional behavior by an extension of the techniques used for normal systems. This leads to an
algorithm capable of predicting the nonlinear threshold for subcritical transitions. The algorithm was illustrated by
application to an N -dimensional degenerate node, where the anomalous scaling behavior was shown to be due to the
fact that the non-normality of the linear term forces a geometrical relationship between the length scales along and
across the stable manifold of the node, an eﬀect which is absent in normal systems. The resulting scaling exponent (14)
shows that non-normality and nonlinearity act together to increase the sensitivity to subcritical transitions, and the
threshold depends exponentially on the number of degrees of freedom taking part, N . Figure (2) suggests that by
measuring such scaling behavior near threshold it might be possible to choose between various models (or at least
eliminate a large class of them), though if N is large such scaling regimes will be extremely narrow in ǫ.

ABSTRACT

Locating where transient signals travel between a source and receiver requires a ﬁnal
step that is needed after using a theory of diﬀraction such as the integral theorem
of Helmholtz and Kirchhoﬀ. Introduced here, the ﬁnal step accounts for interference
between adjacent apertures on a phase screen by adaptively adjusting their phase and
amplitude, yielding a hierarchy of energy contributions to any desired window of signal
travel time at the receiver. The method allows one to check errors in ray theory at
ﬁnite wavelengths. Acoustic propagation at long distance in the oceanic waveguide
(50-100 Hz, 0.05 s resolution) has signiﬁcant deviations from ray theory. The boundary
condition of zero pressure at the surface of the ocean appears to cause sound to travel
in a nearly horizontal trajectory for a much greater distance near the surface than
predicted by rays. The ﬁrst Fresnel zone is an inappropriate scale to characterize where
transient sounds travel near a ray path as assumed by a standard scattering theory.
Instead, the Fresnel zone is too large by an order of magnitude for cases investigated
here. Regions where sounds travel can have complicated structures defying a simple
length scale. These results are applicable to the physics of underwater sound, optics,
radio communication, radar, geophysics, and theories of wave-scattering.

I. INTRODUCTION

Methods that quantify where transient acoustic and electromagnetic signals prop-
agate between a source and receiver in inhomogeneous media have numerous applica-
tions. Acoustic applications include underwater communication systems and scattering
theories from ﬂuctuations in the air, the solid Earth, Sun, and the ocean. Electromag-
netic applications include the Global Positioning System, radar, and communication

systems that are aﬀected by scattering from ﬂuctuations in the index of refraction. It
is important to realize that, except for ray theory, propagation models that compute
the ﬁeld at a receiver from emissions at a source do not reveal where transient signals
propagate to reach the receiver. Instead, they show what the received ﬁeld is. Locating
regions where transient signals travel at ﬁnite wavelength requires solving Helmholtz’s
equation twice, once from the source to receiver, and the other from the receiver to the
source [1, 2]. The integral theorem of Helmholtz and Kirchoﬀ uses these two solutions
to estimate the received signal due to the ﬁeld passing through any aperture on a phase
screen between the source and receiver at ﬁnite wavelengths. This theory and that for
rays have been used for more than a century. The literature on the propagation of
sound in the sea appears to have a single pioneering paper discussing how a diﬀraction
theory based on physical optics [1] compares to the theory of rays for transient signals
at low frequency [3]. That paper yields paths that are ray-like, thus seeming to con-
ﬁrm the ray approximation. Ref. [3] uses a ﬁnal step to estimate where sounds travel.
Later, we will see why that ﬁnal step is not quite what is needed. Without some ﬁnal
step following use of a theory of diﬀraction that utilizes two solutions to Helmholtz’s
equation, it may not be possible to estimate where transient signals propagate between
a source and receiver.

This paper introduces the needed ﬁnal step. It computes where transient signals
propagate based on a hierarchy of energy contributions to any speciﬁed window of
travel time at a receiver. The step adaptively adjusts the phase and amplitude on each
phase screen to account for eﬀects of interference of transient signals between adjacent
apertures on a screen.

An interesting theory has contributed many ideas to how internal waves aﬀect ﬂuc-
tuations of transient sounds in the ocean [4, 5]. The present paper checks one of the
assumptions used in that theory, namely that transient signals travel within a ﬁrst
Fresnel zone of a ray path. This assumption was questioned by the authors of Ref. [5],
but an answer appears to have not been published.

Using the needed ﬁnal step introduced in this paper, we ﬁnd that the Fresnel zone
assumption is not valid. Actual regions where sounds travel can be complicated and
defy representation by a single length scale. Although it is known that ray theory is
expected to be less accurate at low frequencies, accurate quantiﬁcation of error has
apparently not been shown in the literature for inhomogeneous media.

From an intuitive standpoint, the Fresnel radius cannot be the correct scale to use
for transient emissions. For example, consider propagation in a smooth waveguide for
two signals having the same center frequency but diﬀerent pulse resolutions. Assume
the Fresnel radius is evaluated at the center frequency [4, 5]. Signals from a narrow
pulse should remain closer to the ray than a wide pulse because the signal arrives within
a narrower time window then do signals from a wide pulse. Therefore, a Fresnel zone
cannot account for the behavior of signals with diﬀerent bandwidths.

The unsuitability of the Fresnel radius for describing where transient signals prop-
agate from a source to a receiver in homogeneous media was apparently discovered in

1970 in the context of geophysical exploration [6]-[9]. Later, these ideas migrated to
optics where the theory was conﬁrmed with an experiment [10]. The next question
is whether this transient theory can be extrapolated to yield results for inhomoge-
neous media. Unfortunately but not surprisingly, the results in this paper show that
propagation in inhomogeneous media is quite diﬀerent than the simpler situation for
homogeneous media. This paper reveals the complexities of the physics of propagation.
This is an important ﬁrst step toward developing theories to explain the complicated
phenomena.

We start by summarizing results from the propagation of transient signals in homo-
geneous media. These results are applicable for some scenarios in the ocean. They also
help motivate methods for quantifying where sounds travel in inhomogeneous media.

II. HOMOGENEOUS MEDIUM: ZONE OF INFLUENCE FOR
TRANSIENT EMISSIONS

Consider propagation of any transient signal originating from a point source at
P0 = (x0, 0, 0) to a receiver P1 = (x1, 0, 0) through a circular opening of radius R
(Fig. 1). The opening is perpendicular to the line between source and receiver, and
the spatially homogeneous speed of sound is c. When the emitted signal is α(t) with t
denoting time, the exact solution of the acoustic wave equation is obtained using the
general form of Kirchhoﬀ’s theorem for transient signals [6]-[10],

Eq. (1) has a contribution from the signal along the straight path with geometric delay
d/c plus an inverted diﬀracted echo traveling along the line segments P0Q and QP1
with geometric-like delays of r0/c and r1/c respectively (Fig. 1). Interference occurs
between the geometric and diﬀracted echo as long as they are separated by less than the
temporal resolution of the signal, T . When the radius of the circle exceeds R = RI , the
two contributions are separated in time where the ﬁrst contribution, α(t
d/c)/d, is that
obtained from propagation in a homogeneous medium without screens or boundaries.
Thus, the region of space traversed by propagation in a homogeneous medium without
screens is,

when the pulse resolution, T , is replaced by half the period of the single frequency,
λ/2c where the monochromatic wavelength is λ. Note, RI/Rf is √2Q where Q is the
quality of the signal so there is not much diﬀerence unless 2Q is large. Signiﬁcantly,
Eq. (3) only depends on the temporal resolution. It does not depend on the center
frequency as does the Fresnel radius. RI is called the “zone of inﬂuence” [8].

This paper considers where signals travel from a source that contribute energy to a
received travel time within one pulse resolution. This gives rise to the concept of the
zone of inﬂuence which is the relevant physical scale of interest in this paper. This is
not the same as the generalization of the Fresnel radius for transient signals [10]. The
generalized Fresnel radius has a diﬀerent value than the radius for the zone of inﬂuence
for homogeneous media. Additionally, the generalized Fresnel radius approaches the
Fresnel radius as the bandwidth goes to zero. However, RI properly goes to inﬁnity as
the bandwidth goes to zero because the pulse resolution goes to inﬁnity thus admitting
sound from an inﬁnite distance for an inﬁnitely long pulse.

III. DIFFRACTED REGIONS IN INHOMOGENEOUS MEDIA

The contribution to the time series at time t at the receiver from the wave ﬁeld

removes the carrier frequency as in Eq. (47) of Ref. [12] via complex demodulation of

theorem of Helmholtz-Kirchhoﬀ [1, 2] in which case,

or from physical optics1 in which case,

I2(xsc, z, ω) = W0(xsc, z, ω)W1(xsc, z, ω) ,

(Eqs. 18,23 of Ref.
[3]). The solutions of the Helmholtz equation on the screen
due to emissions located at the source and receiver are W0(xsc, z, ω) and W1(xsc, z, ω)
respectively [1, 2]. In this paper, the inclination factor [1] for physical optics is set to
unity because the direction of signal propagation is almost perpendicular to the phase
screens.

Let the “region of diﬀraction” denote locations where sounds travel. This region
was estimated for oceanic propagation [3] by contouring a normalized function of Eq.

where D is the depth of the bottom of the phase screen at horizontal coordinate x = xsc.
The bottom of the phase screen is chosen such that no signiﬁcant energy propagates to
the receiver below D. The top of the phase screen is set at the pressure release surface
of the ocean, z = 0. The function, ˜
Gj(t, xsc, z), goes from zero at z = 0 to unity at
z = D but not necessarily in a monotonic fashion.
Three innovations are introduced that yield accurate estimates of the region of
diﬀraction based on a hierarchy of energy contributions at the receiver. Firstly, we
consider the diﬀracted region responsible for the energy arriving between t
T /2
at the receiver instead of the region responsible for the energy at time t as before
[3]. Secondly, a method is provided for drawing boundaries of diﬀracted regions based
on a calibration with results from homogeneous media instead of apparently choosing
arbitrary boundaries [3]. Thirdly, an adaptive method is introduced for computing the

contribution of each aperture on a phase screen to the energy arriving within t

[3] apparently suppressed ripples of ˜

at the receiver. This method properly accounts for signiﬁcant eﬀects of interference
Gj(t, xsc, z)
between apertures on a screen. Ref.
in Eq.
(9) because they were believed to be caused by the interference of separate
paths (p. 2667 of [3]). We show that ripples can be due to other phenomenon, such
as self-interference within a resolved path, and should be not suppressed nor are they
undesirable. Instead, the ripples are critical to measure to obtain a proper accounting
of the energy passing through any aperture on the way to the receiver. A demonstration
is given ﬁrst for propagation in a homogeneous medium.

Assume a source and receiver are placed at 2 km depth in the sea and separated by
9.129 km over a ﬂat bottom at 5.6 km. To minimize sidelobes in the time domain, a
Hann taper is applied in the frequency domain to the emitted signal between 100
40
Hz. The taper is zero at 60 and 140 Hz, yielding an eﬀective bandwidth of 40 Hz and
a time resolution of 1/40 = 0.025 s. The speed of sound is 1.5 km/s. The theoretical
time for the horizontal path to reach the receiver is 9.129/1.5 = 6.086 s. The next
path at 6.645 s corresponds to energy that reﬂects once from the surface. The path
that reﬂects once from the bottom has a travel time of 7.751 s. All three paths are
temporally resolved with the pulse resolution of 0.025 s.

±

The c0 insensitive parabolic approximation [12] yields estimates of Wi(xsc, z, ω)
(i=0,1) and its derivative for each aperture through Eq. (6) for both j = 1, 2. This
parabolic approximation yields accurate travel times, is eﬃcient due to its split-step
algorithm, and obeys reciprocity.
It is important that reciprocity is obeyed because
a proof for reciprocity is provided by the integral theorem of Helmholtz and Kirch-
hoﬀ. Computational grids in depth and range are made suﬃciently small to achieve
convergence of the solution.

Consider the phase screen half-way between the source and receiver (Fig. 2A). Cu-
T /2 can be examined

which is zero at the surface and unity at the bottom of the phase screen (z=-D). This
function increases monotonically until just after 2 km at which point interference is
observed (Fig. 2A). The apertures on this screen are about 0.02 km wide, so there are
about 300 of these between the surface and the bottom of the screen at 6 km. The
radius of the zone of inﬂuence at this location is about 0.4 km (Eq. 4), so contributions
from the screen should die out at depths of 2
If adjacent
apertures did not interfere, the contribution at the receiver from aperture p would be

Eﬀects of interference for the homogeneous case are illustrated after describing the
following new algorithm which requires no intervention from an operator to determine
how to deal with interference. It provides high-resolution images of an objective func-
tion through a ﬁnite diﬀerence of cumulative contributions of apertures with depth
after properly dealing with decreasing values of the function with depth, if any. In this

Starting from the surface, Eq. (6) is computed to the bottom of the ﬁrst and second

based on the newly replaced mean value of the Fourier coeﬃcients (it is necessary
to go back and check this because the Fourier coeﬃcients for aperture two just got
modiﬁed and one wants to make sure that the jump from aperture 1 to apertures 1
plus 2 still gives a non-decreasing contribution at the receiver). If this last condition
is true (destructive interference is winning), then it is necessary to replace the Fourier
coeﬃcients of apertures 1, 2, and 3 by the mean of their newest values, which guarantees
that contributions from each cumulative aperture going from 1 through 3 yields non-
decreasing values of ρj(0, z+). This procedure continues until the bottom of the phase
screen is reached. The contribution to the objective function at the receiver from each

desired. Fig. (2C) shows that the greatest contributions to the peak of the time series
occur over a narrower depth range than obtained if one assumes that the apertures do
not interfere (Fig. 2B). Panel C displays a slight bias in the center location of the peak
which should ideally occur at a depth of 2 km. The bias is suppressed by conducting
the procedure leading to Eq. (12) from the bottom of the phase screen to the surface,
yielding values of δρj(q)−, and then averaging from both directions,

δρj(q) = [δρj(q)+ + δρj(q)−)]/2 .

SOUND SPEED (m/s)

Figure 4: The speed of sound as a function of depth near Kaneohe Bay, Oahu (21.512
◦N and 202.228 ◦E) according to climatology [13] for Spring and using Del Grosso’s
algorithm for the speed of sound in seawater [14]. Straight lines are drawn between data
points here, but the calculations use a quadratic spline [17] that has no discontinuities
in gradient with depth.

Two methods are described for estimating a diﬀracted region from Eq. (13). The
“relative dB” method uses all apertures within XdB of the value of the maximum
contributing aperture on a phase screen. The “fractional amplitude” method sorts
aperture contributions in non-increasing order, then selects the minimum number of
these sorted contributions from largest to smallest until reaching a speciﬁed fraction,
f , of the maximum amplitude of the peak of the time series at the receiver. Values
23 dB and f = 0.9 ﬁt the theoretical value of the zone of inﬂuence in
for XdB =
a homogeneous medium fairly well (Fig. 3). The size of the diﬀracted region is not
sensitive to the values chosen for X and f . The spatial bias of the diﬀracted region is
suppressed when values of δρj(q) are used (Fig. 3A) instead of δρj(q)+ (Fig. 3C). The
diﬀracted region has holes that indicate non-monotonic variations in sonic level within
the zone of inﬂuence (Fig. 2C), indicating interference between sound traveling along
the direct path and sound traveling along a diﬀracted path near the periphery and back
to the receiver. Therefore, eﬀects of diﬀracted echoes are evident even in the absence
of an edge on a circular opening (Sec. II).

IV. REGIONS OF DIFFRACTION FOR WAVEGUIDE PROPAGATION
IN THE OCEAN

Consider climatological conditions for Spring [13] for the North Paciﬁc near Kaneohe
Bay, Oahu (21.512 ◦N and 202.228 ◦E). Sound speeds, which only vary with depth,
are estimated from temperature, salinity, and depth using Del Grosso’s algorithm [14]
(Fig. 4). The acoustic models described below propagate the acoustic ﬁeld in Cartesian
coordinates after applying the Earth ﬂattening transformation to the ﬁeld in Fig. (4).

11

Four cases are considered. The purpose of the ﬁrst three is to see if the region of
diﬀraction becomes more ray-like with increasing frequency. The emitted signal has
a bandwidth of 20 Hz and the center frequency is set at 50, 100, and 200 Hz. The
equivalent pulse resolution is given by the inverse bandwidth, 0.05 s.

The purpose of the fourth case is to see how the region of diﬀraction decreases with
decreasing pulse width. The case repeats the 100 Hz center frequency emission, but
the bandwidth is increased to 40 Hz, yielding a narrower resolution of 0.025 s.

Assume the source and receiver are separated by 523.845 km and placed at 800 m
depth, corresponding to the minimum speed (Fig. 4). The bottom is at 4500 m. As
before, the signal is tapered with a Hann ﬁlter in the frequency domain to suppress
sidelobes in the time domain. Attenuation of sound by seawater is accounted for as a
function of frequency.

The sound-speed insensitive parabolic approximation [12] incorporates a geoacoustic
bottom that is speciﬁed as follows. The sediment thickness is 200 m. The ratio of
sound speed and density at the top of the sediment layer to that at the bottom of
the water column are 1.02 and 1.7 respectively. The attenuation in the sediment is
α(f ) = 0.02f (dB/m) where f is acoustic frequency in kHz. The speed increases with
depth at a rate of 1 s−1 in the sediment. The ratio of sound speed and density at the
top of the basement to that at the bottom of the sediment are 2 and 2.5 respectively.
The attenuation in the basement is α(f ) = 0.5f 0.1 (dB/m).

The software for the sound-speed insensitive approximation has been used before
to identify broadband signals over basin-scales [16]. It yields travel times that agree
with exact solutions from normal modes within a few milliseconds over basin-scales for
speeds that vary with depth only [12].

Regions of diﬀraction are compared with rays. The ray program, zray, and its
eigenray ﬁnder have been described and successfully used to study acoustic propagation
for many experiments [16, 17]. Its results agree with analytical solutions. Sound speeds
used by the ray program are the same as those used by the parabolic approximation on
its computational grid. Between grid points, the speed is obtained using a quadratic
spline. The spline goes through each grid point, and has no gradient discontinuities
[17].

Attention is focused on two peaks that are temporally resolved at 0.05 s resolution
(Fig. 5) (Table I). Each peak is due to a single resolved ray. These peaks appear in
all four cases except at 50 Hz where peak 1 is not present because of the interaction of
low frequency sound with the sub-bottom (Fig. 5B).

Figure 5: Impulse responses from ﬁve models between a source and receiver separated
by 523.845 km and depths of 800 m with peaks 1 and 2 indicated. The top panel comes
from tracing rays through the proﬁle in Fig. (4). The next four panels are obtained
using the sound-speed insensitive parabolic approximation [12] (PE) for the same ﬁeld
of speed as the rays. The center frequencies for the PE runs are 50, 100, and 200 Hz
(panels B, C, D) with a pulse resolution of 0.05 s. Panel E has a center frequency of
100 Hz and a pulse resolution of 0.025 s.

Figure 6: Paths for peak 1 for the same cases in Fig.
(5) respectively. The top
panel is the ray, and the others from the integral theorem of Helmholtz and Kirchhoﬀ
(Eq. 6, j = 1) using the relative dB method and Eq. (13) to estimate the energy
contributions from each 0.0195 wide vertical aperture on each phase screen. The depth
of the bottom at 4.5 km is indicated. Panels B-D are for center frequencies of 50, 100,
200 Hz respectively with pulse resolution of 0.05 s. Panel E is for a center frequency
of 100 Hz and a pulse resolution of 0.025 s. Peak 1 does not occur at 50 Hz due to
interaction of sound with the bottom (Fig. 5).

The integral theorem of Helmholtz and Kirchhoﬀ is used to compute the results
in this section via Eq.
(6). However, results based on physical optics look almost
identical (not shown). Using the relative dB method that accounts for interference on
phase screens (Eq. 13) diﬀracted regions for the peaks look somewhat like their ray
paths with signiﬁcant discrepancies in many cases (Figs. 6-7). The vertical stripes
occurring at some ranges indicate that a wide range of depths contribute to the relative
dB method at the -23 dB threshold on some phase screens. All diﬀracted regions show
that sound extends over a ﬂatter and more extended horizontal region near the surface
than their ray counterparts (e.g. 40 km instead of O(1) km for peak 2 in Fig. 7). Peak
1 (Fig. 6C,D) looks less ray like at 200 Hz than 100 Hz (Fig. 6). Peak 2’s upper
turning regions look like they have antlers that extend the exposure to the surface
region, particularly at a center frequency of 50 Hz (Fig. 7B). The bottoms of the
diﬀracted regions appear to have attachments of broadly shaped “V’s” that are more
pronounced at mid range than near the source or receiver. These “V’s” are suppressed
when the pulse resolution is changed from 0.05 to 0.025 s (Fig. 7E).

14

Figure 7: Same as Fig. 6 except for peak 2.

The fractional amplitude method for drawing diﬀracted regions from Eq. (13) yields
diﬀracted regions that look a little fuzzier and fatter for peak 2 than those using the
relative dB method (Figs. 7,8). Results are similar for the other peaks (not shown).

Blowups of the diﬀracted regions associated with peak 2 near 100 Hz (Fig. 9A)
allow better scrutiny of the departures from ray theory. The threshold criteria for the
relative dB method is changed to suppress some of the apertures that contribute quieter
sounds (Fig. 9B). Further suppression of quieter apertures makes the diﬀracted regions
look discontinuous in space which seems unphysical because there would not be any
path joining the source and receiver. Thus the ﬂat regions near the surface that look
so unlike rays, and some of the other extensions away from the ray path are signiﬁcant
departures from ray theory.

A. Importance of accounting for interference on a phase screen in
inhomogeneous media

When the eﬀects of interference are not dealt with using Eq. (13), the region of
diﬀraction looks less plausible than otherwise (e.g. peak 2, Figs. 7,10). The diﬀerence
is due to the fact that some adjacent apertures on phase screens pass large amounts of
energy that destructively interfere at the receiver leaving little net energy.

B. Comparison with Fresnel radius for inhomogeneous medium

The ﬁrst Fresnel radius for any point A on a ray path between a source and receiver
is the distance, perpendicular to the ray at A, to a point B such that the diﬀerence of

Figure 8: Same as Fig. 7 for peak 2 except this uses the fractional amplitude method
with f = 0.9. These diﬀracted regions are fuzzier and somewhat wider than obtained
using the relative dB method.

adjacent vertical apertures on phase screens are not corrected using Eq. (13). Instead
this estimate of the diﬀracted regions assumes that adjacent apertures do not interfere
with each other, yielding an incorrect picture for where sounds travel. The apertures
within 6 dB of the most energetic aperture on each phase screen are shown because
when interference is not accounted for, the 6 dB threshold yields the theoretical zone
of inﬂuence for homogeneous media (not shown).

17

the signal wavelength is one-half between the ray and the perturbed ray passing through
B and back to the receiver. For steeply cycling rays in the deep ocean waveguide such
as shown in Figs. (6- 7), ﬁrst order analysis and more exact numerical evaluations
demonstrate the standard result that the Fresnel radius for such rays is zero at its
turning points and is approximately the Fresnel radius for an homogeneous medium
in-between, i.e. Eq. (5), (see Eq. 7.1.11 in Ref.
[5]). For
d = 523.845 km, λ = 1.5 km s−1/100 Hz = 0.015 km, and x = d/2 (half-way between
source and receiver), the Fresnel radius is Rf = 1.4 km. If the Fresnel radius was a good
1.4 km
predictor of the region of diﬀraction, the diﬀracted region would encompass
on either side of the unperturbed ray path near 250 km and go to zero at the turning
points of the rays in Figs. (6-7). However, the diﬀracted region for peaks 1 and 2 extend
for a length scale of O(0.1) km in a direction perpendicular to the unperturbed rays,
and a radius of 1.4 km is too large for all the diﬀracted regions shown. The diﬀracted
region does not go to zero at the turning points.

Replacing the radius of the zone of inﬂuence, RI, for Rf does not help this discrep-
0.05 s = 0.15 km needed by RI
ancy because the length scale 2cT = 2
exceeds λ = 0.015 km for Rf at 100 Hz, making RI about 4.5 km. It is unfortunate
but not surprising that neither the Fresnel radius nor the zone of inﬂuence in Eq. (4)
provide the correct scaling for diﬀracted regions in inhomogeneous media.

V. VERIFYING ALGORITHMS

It is important to verify the correctness of the algorithms because of the fundamental
importance of the results. The strongest evidence for the validity of these results
should and must come from other independent investigations. For example, a previous
construction of diﬀracted regions [3] shows that sound lingers longer near the surface
than the corresponding ray. This behavior appears in Figs. (6- 7) in a much more
pronounced way. There are four other reasons to believe the algorithms are correct.

Firstly, the algorithms for the inhomogeneous case are identical to those for the
homogeneous case which agrees with the analytical solution for the zone of inﬂuence
(Fig. 3). Secondly, the derivation of the integral theorem of Helmholtz and Kirchhoﬀ
includes a proof for the reciprocity of the ﬁeld in a time-independent medium. The
c0 insensitive parabolic approximation in this paper, must also obey reciprocity, and
it does [12]. Thirdly , the time series at the receiver should look like the time series
computed from the integral theorem of Helmholtz and Kirchhoﬀ after integrating over
all depths for any vertical screen between the source and receiver, and they do. Fourthly,
results from physical optics [1] look nearly identical to those from the integral theorem
of Helmholtz and Kirchhoﬀ for all cases in this paper (not shown) The similarity is due
to the fact that sound propagates nearly perpendicular to the vertical phase screens,
thus the inclination factor from physical optics should be very near unity as chosen for
Eq. (8).

VI. CONCLUSIONS

18

A needed last step was added to the integral theorem of Helmholtz and Kirchoﬀ for
the purpose of quantifying hierarchical contributions of energy to any speciﬁed time
window at a receiver from transient emissions from a source. The resulting construction
of regions where signals travel appear to be the ﬁrst of its kind for application in inho-
mogeneous media. The method introduced here is a fundamental tool in understanding
the physics of transient propagation between two points, and is useful for quantifying
errors in the theory of rays.

Using the new method, the ﬁrst Fresnel radius is shown to be an incorrect scale
for estimating where transient signals travel between a source and receiver in inhomo-
geneous media. A scattering theory of sound in the ocean adopts the Fresnel radius
for determining which ﬂuctuations aﬀect transient propagation near a ray [4, 5]. A
re-interpretation of this theory in light of the ﬁndings here should be considered. This
paper ﬁnds that the regions where signals travel can be complicated, and may defy a
simple formula for explaining the physics, such as the Fresnel radius does for single-
frequency signals.

∼

A theory that predicts the scattering of sound by internal waves has been shown to
not ﬁt observations for an experiment at 75 Hz center frequency and 35 Hz bandwidth
over 3250 km in the Paciﬁc [5]. The data are consistent with scattering in the un-
saturated or partially unsaturated regime. The theory predicts that scattering should
be in the fully saturated regime. The theory would be more consistent with the data
(R/L)2 was several orders of magnitude smaller
if its so-called size parameter, Λ
[5]). Here, R represents the
than its predicted values from 1 to 40 (Fig. 19, Ref.
distance perpendicular to an unperturbed ray over which the sound is inﬂuenced by
ﬂuctuations, and L is the spatial scale of the ﬂuctuations. Standard theoretical and
numerical results from that theory yield R = 0 at the upper turning points of the rays
O(Rf ) in between which is about 2 km for the 3250 km transmission (Fig.
and R
20, Ref. [5]). For the simulations discussed in Sec. IVB, the diﬀracted regions are an
order of magnitude less than the Fresnel radius. If the same was true for the Paciﬁc
experiment, Λ would decrease by two orders of magnitude. This would close the gap
between theory and observation. The only point of this back-of-the-envelope calcula-
tion is to raise the possibility that an accurate calculation of the diﬀracted region in
the Paciﬁc experiment might contribute to a more accurate prediction.

∼

It is important to quantify errors in the ray approximation. At 100 Hz, the wave-
length in the sea is 15 m. This is small compared with the 1000 m scale of the wave
guide (Fig. 4). The results given here suggest this ratio needs to be much smaller to
consistently yield ray-like paths. Perhaps the break down of ray theory at low frequen-
cies is due to the boundary conditions at the surface and bottom. It is also possible
that the pulse resolution needs to be much smaller than 0.025 s to yield ray-like paths
at low frequencies. Of course, there is a practical limit for the pulse resolution at low
frequency. The range of validity for Snell’s law is apparently not well understood at
this time, despite its use for describing sound transmission in the deep sea since 1917
[18]. The advance of computers makes it possible to research this subject in new ways.

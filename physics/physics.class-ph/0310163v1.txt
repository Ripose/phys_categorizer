Abstract

We examine the spinning behavior of egg-shaped axisymmetric bodies whose cross sections are

described by several oval curves similar to real eggs with thin and fat ends. We use the gyroscopic

balance condition of Moﬀatt and Shimomura and analyze the slip velocity of the bodies at the point

of contact as a function of θ, the angle between the axis of symmetry and the vertical axis, and ﬁnd

the existence of the critical angle θc. When the bodies are spun with an initial angle θinitial > θc,

θ will increase to π, implying that the body will spin at the thin end. Alternatively, if θinitial < θc,

then θ will decrease. For some oval curves, θ will reduce to 0 and the corresponding bodies will

spin at the fat end. For other oval curves, a ﬁxed point at θf is predicted, where 0 < θf < θc.

Then the bodies will spin not at the fat end, but at a new stable point with θf . The empirical fact

that eggs more often spin at the fat than at the thin end is explained.

INTRODUCTION

Spinning objects have historically been interesting subjects to study. The spin reversal
of the rattleback1 (also called a celt or wobblestone) and the behavior of the tippe top2

are typical examples. Recently, the riddle of spinning eggs was resolved by Moﬀatt and
Shimomura.3 When a hard-boiled egg is spun suﬃciently rapidly on a table with its axis of

symmetry horizontal, the axis will rise from the horizontal to the vertical. They discovered

that if an axisymmetric body is spun suﬃciently rapidly, a gyroscopic balance condition

holds. Given this condition a constant of the motion exists for the spinning motion of an
axisymmetric body. The constant, which is known as the Jellett constant,4 has been found

previously for symmetric tops such as the tippe top. Using these facts, they derived a ﬁrst-

order diﬀerential equation for θ, the angle between the axis of symmetry and the vertical

axis. For a uniform spheroid as an example they showed that the axis of symmetry indeed

rises from the horizontal to the vertical.

The shape of an egg looks like a spheroid, but is not exactly so. It has thin and fat ends.

Which end of the spinning egg will rise? Empirically, we know that either end can rise. But

we more often see eggs spinning at the fat end with the thin end up rather than the other

way round. In this paper we investigate the spinning behavior of egg-shaped axisymmetric

bodies whose cross sections are described by several oval curves. We use the gyroscopic

balance condition and analyze the slip velocity of the body at the point of contact as a

function of θ and ﬁnd the existence of the critical angle θc for each model curve. When the

bodies are spun with the initial angle θinitial > θc, θ will increase to π, which means that

the body will spin at the thin end. Alternatively, if θinitial < θc, then θ will decrease. For

some oval curves, θ will decrease to 0 and the corresponding bodies will shift to the stable

spinning state at the fat end. For other oval curves, a ﬁxed point at θf is predicted, where

0 < θf < θc. In this case the bodies will spin not at the fat end but at a new stable point

with θf . We also explain why we observe more eggs spinning at the fat end than at the thin

end.

The paper is organized as follows: To explain our notation and the geometry, we review

the work of Ref. 3 on spinning eggs in Sec. II. Then in Sec. III we introduce several models of

oval curves that we will study. In Sec. IV we analyze the spinning behavior of axisymmetric

bodies whose cross sections are described by these oval curves. The ﬁnal section is devoted

2

to a summary and discussion.

II. SPINNING EGG

We follow the geometry and notation of Ref. 3 in their analysis of spinning eggs as much

as possible. As is shown in Fig. 1, an axisymmetric body spins on a horizontal table with

point of contact P . We will work in a rotating frame of reference OXYZ, where the center

of mass is at the origin, O. The symmetry axis of the body, Oz, and the vertical axis, OZ,

deﬁne a plane Π, which precesses about OZ with angular velocity Ω(t) = (0, 0, Ω). We

choose the horizontal axis OX in the plane Π and thus OY is vertical to Π and inward. The

angle of interest is θ(t), the angle between OZ and Oz.

In a rotating frame of reference Oxyz, where Ox is in the plane Π and perpendicular

to the symmetry axis Oz and where Oy coincides with OY , the body spins about Oz with
the rate ˙ψ. Since, in the frame Oxyz, Ω is expressed as Ω =
Ω sin θˆx + Ω cos θˆz, the
Ω sin θˆx + ˙θˆy + nˆz. Here ˆx, ˆy, and ˆz
angular velocity of the body, ω, is given by ω =

the dot represents diﬀerentiation with respect to time. The Ox and Oy axes are not body-
ﬁxed axes but they are principal axes, so that the angular momentum, L, is expressed by
AΩ sin θˆx + A ˙θˆy + Cnˆz, where (A, A, C) are the principal moments of inertia at O.

The coordinate system OXYZ is obtained from the frame Oxyz by rotating the latter

where XP is the position vector of the contact point P from O, R is the normal reaction at

where h(θ) is the height of O above the table. We will see in Sec. IV that h(θ) is determined

as a function of θ, once the geometry and density distribution of the body are known.

When the frictional force is weak and ˙θ is correspondingly small, the slip velocity of the

point P is, to leading order in ˙θ, expressed as UP = (0, VP , 0), where

VP = (Ω sin2 θ + n cos θ)

Hence, the frictional force, F , is to leading order, F = (0, F, 0), where F is a function of VP

AΩ cos θ)Ω sin θ = 0. Then, for sin θ

= 0, we arrive at a condition

−

which was recently discovered by Moﬀatt and Shimomura3 and was called by them as the
gyroscopic balance condition. Under this condition, the Jellett constant4 also exists for
a general axisymmetric body. With Eq. (7), the angular momentum simpliﬁes to L =
(0, A ˙θ, AΩ), and the X- and Z-components of Eq. (3) reduce, respectively, to

Cn = AΩ cos θ,

Hence, if we know h(θ) from geometrical considerations , we may solve Eq. (10) and de-
termine the time-dependence of θ. Moﬀatt and Shimomura3 considered a uniform spheroid

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

(12)

as an example and showed that θ decreases from π/2 to 0 for the prolate spheroid while θ

increases from 0 to π/2 for the oblate one.

However, the shape of an egg is not a spheroid and has thin and fat ends. Which end of

the spinning egg will rise? Empirically, we know that either end may rise and that the body

spins with its axis of symmetry vertical. Which end the spinning egg chooses might seem to

depend on the inclination of the initial axis of symmetry, that is, the initial value of θ. In

the following we examine several models of oval curves and determine the relation between

the initial value of θ and the ﬁnal spinning position of the egg-shaped body.

III. MODELS OF OVAL CURVE

The shape of a three-dimensional egg can be reconstructed by rotating its two-dimensional

cross section around the axis of symmetry. The cross section of an egg looks similar to an

ellipse, but is not quite. It is sharper at one end than at the other. We will examine several

model curves that have been proposed for the cross-section of a real egg.

Let us consider an axisymmetric body whose cross-section is described by

x2 = g(z),

(13)

with g(z) > 0 for zmin < z < zmax and g(zmin) = g(zmax) = 0, where we choose the z axis as

the symmetry axis. If the body has uniform density, then the volume and the z component

Of course, the density of a real egg is not uniform. But if the density distribution is given

by ρ(r, z) as a function of r and z, where r is the distance from the symmetry axis, and the

cross-section is still described by Eq. (13), we can calculate zg, A, and C.

The following are the oval curves that we will examine.

(i) Cartesian oval. The curve, given by √z2 + x2 + m

(z + a)2 + x2 = c, consists of two

ovals. For deﬁniteness we set m = 2. The inside oval is expressed by x2 = g(z) with

with a, b > 0. If a > b, the curve consists of two loops, both of which look like the

cross-section of a real egg with thin and fat ends. We choose the one that is expressed
by x2 = g(z) with

(iii) Cassini oval with an air chamber. A real egg has an air chamber near the fat end. We

take into account the existence of an air chamber by using the Cassini oval (17) and

We plot in Fig. 7 the Cartesian and Cassini ovals and the Wassenaar egg curve, adjusting

the parameter a for each case so that they have the same length along the symmetry axis. We

observe that the Cartesian and Cassini ovals almost overlap. Indeed the axisymmetric bodies

whose cross sections are expressed by these oval curves have close values of A/C (1.26 and

1.25 for the Cartesian and Cassini ovals, respectively). However, we will see in Sec. IV that

these ovals predict diﬀerent spinning behavior for the corresponding axisymmetric bodies.

Equation (20) implies that the change of θ is governed by the sign of

VP . If

VP is positive

(negative), θ will increase (decrease) with time. Therefore a close examination of the be-
VP as a function of θ will be important. Moﬀatt and Shimomura3 showed that

havior of

VP has the form

constant. Thus if the body is spun (suﬃciently rapidly) on a table with the initial inclina-

tion angle θinitial < π/2, then θ decreases to 0. On the other hand, if the body is spun with

∝

e

θinitial > π/2, θ increases to π. Either end will rise, because both ends of the prolate spheroid

look the same. The case of a real egg is diﬀerent. We can easily distinguish between the

thin and the fat end. We will now analyze the axisymmetric bodies whose cross-sections are

expressed by the oval curves introduced in Sec. III.

We take a coordinate system in which the center of mass O resides at the origin. In this

coordinate system, the oval curves satisfy

x2 = f (z) = g(z + zg),

(22)

where g(z) is introduced in Eq. (13) to describe the cross-section of an axisymmetric body

whose center of mass is at z = zg. We consider the point P (z, x =

f (z)) on the curve (see

p
Fig. 8). The slope β of the line tangent to the curve at P is given by

From Eq. (25), XP and VP can be considered as functions of θ. As an example, we plot

in Fig. 9 the graph of XP versus θ for the case of the Cartesian oval in Eq. (16). In addition

to θ = 0 and π, XP vanishes at an angle θr, which is obtained by solving

When the body is placed at rest on a table, its inclination angle is θr and the height h(θ) of

center of mass O from the table is a minimum at θr. We observe from Eqs. (5) or (12) that
VP = 0 at θ = 0 and π, because sin θ = 0 and dh

dθ (= Xp) = 0 at these points. Moreover, VP

vanishes at other angles, which are given by solving

We next examine the graph of

VP as a function of θ for the oval curves introduced in

(i) A Cartesian oval. Figure 10 shows that

VP crosses the line

VP = 0 at an angle θc and

VP > 0 for θc < θ < π but is negative for 0 < θ < θc. So, the angle θc is a critical point.

e

e

If the body is spun on a table with the initial angle θinitial > θc, then θ will increase to π,
e

which means that the body will eventually spin at the thin end. For θinitial < θc, we will

9

see that the body spins at the fat end. That is, depending on the initial value θinitial, the

body will spin at the thin or the fat end. Both ends are stable points. We have A > C for

Cartesian ovals, which leads to θc > θr. Numerically we obtain from Eqs. (30) and (29) that

θc = 1.86 and θr = 1.72. Recall that θr is the inclination angle when the body is placed at

rest. If we spin the body involuntarily, the initial angle θinitial tends to be near θr. Because

0 < θr < θc, it is likely that the body is spun with θinitial between 0 and θc, and thus it

will shift to the stable spinning state at the fat end. Empirically, we more often observe

eggs spinning at the fat end rather than at the thin end. The expected behavior of the

axisymmetric body expressed by the Cartesian oval in Eq. (16) well explains the observed

features of the spinning egg.

(ii) A Cassini oval. The second example of oval curves presents an interesting situation.

We see from Fig. 11 that

VP crosses the line

VP = 0 at θf and θc (θf < θc), and that

VP

is negative for θf < θ < θc and otherwise positive. Numerically we obtain θf = 0.45 and
e

e

e

θc = 1.92 (and θr = 1.77). Thus the graph of

VP in Fig. 11 implies that for the Cassini oval

(17) the thin end (θ = π) is a stable point, but the fat end is not. When the body is spun
e

with the initial value of θ anywhere between 0 and θc, θ will approach the ﬁxed point θf .

In other words, the body will spin not at the fat end, but at the point with the inclination

angle θf . It is interesting to note that the curves of the Cartesian (16) and Cassini (17)

ovals almost overlap each other when they are adjusted to have the same length along the

symmetry axis (see Fig. 7). But they predict diﬀerent behaviors for

VP and thus diﬀerent

spinning behaviors for the corresponding axisymmetric bodies. Does a hard boiled egg show

e

the behavior predicted by this Cassini oval? We are almost certain that we have never seen

such a behavior.

(iii) A Cassini oval with an air chamber. Because an egg has an air chamber near the

fat end, we study the case of a Cassini oval with an air chamber. The existence of an air

chamber moves the position of center of mass zg toward the thin end, from zg =

0.840a

−

to zg =

0.798a, and reduces the ratio A/C from 1.25 to 1.07. Consequently, the ﬁxed

−

point at θf , which is present for Eq. (17), disappears. The graph of

VP in Fig. 12 shows

that it crosses the line

VP = 0 only once at θc = 1.97. The inclination angle at rest becomes

e

θr = 1.93, which is very close to the value of θc because A/C

point.

(iv) Wassenaar egg curve. Figure 13 shows that this curve has a ﬁxed point at θf = 0.93.

When θinitial is between 0 and θc = 1.85, θ will move to θf , another stable point in addition

to the one at the thin end (θ = π). In addition, the graph of XP for this oval curve vanishes

at two other points. One is at θr = 1.78, a position at rest, and one at θ = 0.58, an unstable

(v) Lemniscate of Bernoulli. For the lemniscate of Bernoulli, we ﬁnd limz→zmax(1/β) =

1,

−

so that Eq. (25) tells us that the allowed region of θ is between 0 and 3π/4. Figure 14 shows

that

VP vanishes at the fat end (θ = 0), at the ﬁxed point (θf = 0.74), and at the critical

point (θc = 1.96). The position of the body at rest is at θr = 1.81, and its spinning state

e

has two stable points at θ = θf and 3π/4.

V. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION

We have examined the spinning behavior of axisymmetric bodies whose cross sections are

described by several model curves, including a Cartesian oval, Cassini ovals with and without

an air chamber, and the Wassenaar egg curve. These results together with the lemniscate

of Bernoulli are summarized in Table I. For each oval curve we used the gyroscopic balance

condition (7) and found the predicted slip velocity VP of the contact point as a function of

the inclination angle θ and the existence of the critical angle θc. When the body is spun on

a table with the initial angle θinitial > θc, θ will increase to π, which means that the body

will spin at the thin end. If θinitial < θc, then θ will decrease. For the Cartesian oval and

Cassini oval with an air chamber, θ will reduce to 0 and the corresponding bodies will spin

at the fat end. Moreover, when the bodies are spun without intention, we expect to see their

spinning states at the fat end more often than at the thin end because the inclination angle

θr at rest is smaller than θc. This behavior is consistent with the features of a spinning egg.

On the other hand, the Cassini oval and Wassenaar egg curves predict the existence of

the ﬁxed point at θf , where 0 < θf < θc. Then the fat end (θ = 0) is no longer a stable

point. If the corresponding bodies are spun with θinitial < θc, θ moves to θf and not to 0,

and the bodies will spin at a new stable point at θf . The lemniscate of Bernoulli is not an

oval curve, but the body described by this curve also has a ﬁxed point.

11

It would be very interesting to make axisymmetric bodies whose cross sections are de-

scribed by the Cassini oval (17), Wassenaar egg curve (18) and the lemniscate of Bernoulli

(19) and determine if those bodies will spin at a new stable point that is diﬀerent from the

fat end.

toward π.

The inclusion of an air chamber at the fat end tends to diminish the appearance of the

ﬁxed point at θf . The case of a Cassini oval is an example. For the Wassenaar egg curve,

we need a rather large air chamber; an empty space for

a

−

≤

z

≤ −

0.5a in Eq. (18) is

necessary for the disappearance of θf . The ﬁxed point of the lemniscate vanishes if we take

zmin =

1.33a for Eq. (19). Moreover, the inclusion of an air chamber at the fat end moves

the position of the center of mass zg toward the thin end and makes the ratio A/C smaller.

Consequently, the values of the critical angle θc and the inclination angle at rest θr move

We have assumed Coulomb’s law for the friction F (see Eq. (11)). If we instead assume

a viscous friction law,

F =

all our conclusions remain unchanged, in particular, the positions of the critical points and

ﬁxed points. Only the transition time from the unstable to the stable state will be modiﬁed.

As an example, the transition time from the angle θc to π is numerically calculated to be

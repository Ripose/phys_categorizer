Quasi-geostrophic kinematic dynamos at low
magnetic Prandtl number

Abstract

Rapidly rotating spherical kinematic dynamos are computed using the combination
of a quasi geostrophic (QG) model for the velocity ﬁeld and a classical spectral 3D
code for the magnetic ﬁeld. On one hand, the QG ﬂow is computed in the equatorial
plane of a sphere and corresponds to Rossby wave instabilities of a geostrophic inter-
nal shear layer produced by diﬀerential rotation. On the other hand, the induction
equation is computed in the full sphere after a continuation of the QG ﬂow along
the rotation axis. Diﬀerential rotation and Rossby-wave propagation are the key in-
gredients of the dynamo process which can be interpreted in terms of αΩ dynamo.
Taking into account the quasi geostrophy of the velocity ﬁeld to increase its time
and space resolution enables us to exhibit numerical dynamos with very low Ekman
(rapidly rotating) and Prandtl numbers (liquid metals) which are asymptotically
relevant to model planetary core dynamos.

1 Introduction

The magnetic ﬁeld of the Earth is produced by a dynamo eﬀect in the metallic
liquid core of our rotating planet. Many eﬀorts have been made successfully in
the last decade to describe the mechanism of a self induced magnetic ﬁeld ei-
ther with experimental models [1,2,3] or numerical simulations [4,5,6,7]. Both
approaches have limitations. No experiment has been done in rotation while
rotation is seen as a key ingredient by geophysicists to explain the geometry
and the amplitude of the geomagnetic ﬁeld [8]. All numerical models [9,10]
have introduced the Coriolis force in solving the Navier-Stokes equation and
the quasi geostrophy (two dimensionality imposed by the Taylor Proudman
theorem [11]) of the ﬂow participates in the generation of the magnetic ﬁeld.

Thermal convective vortices aligned with the rotation axis are associated to
surface patches of magnetic ﬁeld [7] and spatio-temporal behaviors of mag-
netic and vorticity ﬁeld are similar. This eﬀect is a direct consequence of the
prescribed magnetic Prandtl number (Pm = ν/η, where ν is the kinematic
viscosity and η the magnetic diﬀusivity) in the simulations. The current com-
puter capacities limit the computation to magnetic Prandtl number of the
order of unity [9] while liquid metals exhibit magnetic Prandtl number lower
than 10−5, even in the planetary core conditions [12].

In this paper, we propose an approach that aims at computing very low mag-
netic Prandtl number dynamos taking advantage of the quasi-geostrophic be-
havior of the velocity ﬁeld. For very low Ekman number (E = ν/ΩR2, where
Ω is the rotation rate of the spherical container, and R its radius), a quasi-
geostrophic (QG) approach models correctly the ﬂow in a rapidly rotating
sphere [13,14]. It consists of the integration of the ﬂow equations along the ro-
tation axis. Even if the numerical resolution is done with a stream function in
the equatorial plane (2D), the top and bottom boundary conditions are taken
into account through slope (β) and Ekman pumping eﬀects. In the context of
the study of thermal convection in rapidly rotating spherical shells, Aubert et
al. [15] have compared successfully their QG results with 3D calculations [16]
and experimental measurement [17]. Low value of Pm may imply a separation
in term of scales and frequencies, between the velocity and magnetic ﬁelds in
a metallic dynamo. This idea has already been applied to kinematic dynamo
computations at low Pm [18].

In this work, we compute the QG ﬂow in the equatorial plane with a ﬁne
spatio-temporal resolution and the velocity is extrapolated to a coarse 3D
spherical grid where the induction equation is solved.

In order to demonstrate the validity of this approach, we have decided to apply
it to a simple case. Instead of a thermal convective ﬂow for which heat trans-
port has to be modeled, we model the instabilities of an internal geostrophic
shear layer. This layer, known as the Stewartson layer, is produced by a dif-
ferentially rotating inner core in a rotating sphere and consists of two nested
viscous shear layers [19,20]. For a critical Ro number (Ro = ∆Ω/Ω, where
∆Ω is the diﬀerential rate of rotation of the inner core), the Stewartson layer
becomes unstable [21] and generates Rossby waves [22].

As we will show in this paper, such kind of ﬂow can generate and sustain
a magnetic ﬁeld. The QG-model allows us to compute dynamos at very low
Ekman (down to 10−8) and Prandtl numbers (as low as 3 10−3).

Let us consider a sphere of radius R ﬁlled with an incompressible liquid metal
of viscosity ν and magnetic diﬀusivity η. The sphere is rotating at Ω along
the z-axis of a cylindrical reference frame (es, eφ, ez). The sphere is split at
sin−1(Rs/R) (Rs/R is set to 0.35). The two polar caps are
the colatitude
diﬀerentially rotating at ∆Ω as shown in ﬁgure 1. Ω−1 is chosen to scale the
time, R the length, (µ0ρ)1/2RΩ the magnetic ﬁeld. For low Ekman and Rossby
numbers, the ﬂow is quasi geostrophic [11]. Taking the curl of the Navier-
Stokes equation and averaging along the rotation axis z (noted by an overbar),
u,
we get the QG equation for the z-component of the vorticity ω = ez
provided that us and uφ are independent of z [22].

sumed for the velocity at s = 1. For s < Rs/R, the top and bottom azimuthal
velocity are imposed as uφ = sRo. The velocity ﬁeld is computed using a gen-
eralised stream function in the equatorial plane as in [22] which guarantees
the 3D mass conservation. The stream function is expanded in Fourier compo-
nents along the φ component. It may be interesting to introduce the Reynolds
number Re = RoE−1 directly related to the two controlling dimensionless
numbers E and Ro.

In this paper, as a ﬁrst step, we will only consider kinematic dynamos and the
magnetic terms in (1, 4) will be neglected.

2.2 Induction equation

The velocity ﬁeld computed with equations (1, 4) in the equatorial plane is
extrapolated to a spherical grid (on Gauss collocation points) in the physical
space. This is a straightforward process because us and uφ are independent
of z and uz is a linear function of z. Then, the velocity ﬁeld is changed into
spherical coordinates (er, eθ, eφ) to compute the non linear induction term.

of the code has been checked using kinematic dynamo results [23] and the
dynamo benchmark [24].

2.3 Numerical implementation

A ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme is used on an irregular radial grid (denser in the
Stewartson and Ekman layers). A semi implicit Crank-Nicholson scheme is
used for linear terms in time whereas an Adams-Bashforth procedure is imple-
mented for non linear terms. For low Pm, cylindrical and spherical radial grid
steps may diﬀer by a factor 20. Similarly, time steps for the induction equation
may be much longer than the velocity time steps (as much as 20 times). For a
run at E = 10−8, the stream function is computed on a cylindrical mesh made
of 600 radial points and expanded in Fourier series up to degree m = 170 while
the magnetic ﬁeld is expanded in spherical harmonics (Lmax = 79, Mmax = 32)
with an irregular radial grid of 150 points for Pm = 10−2.5. By increasing Mmax
and reducing the time step factor, we checked that such truncatures do not
inﬂuence the onset of dynamo action.

rotation axis. This geostrophic viscous layer consists of two nested layers of
diﬀerent widths as revealed by the asymptotic study of Stewartson [19] and
illustrated later by a numerical study of Dormy et al. [20]; a larger one of size
E1/4 which accommodates the jump in azimuthal velocity geostrophically and
a narrower one of size E1/3, ageostrophic, which corresponds to an axial jet
insuring the mass conservation.

In our previous study [22], we presented the QG model, which can reproduce
only the E1/4 layer, and we studied the linear perturbations of this geostrophic
internal viscous layer. It becomes unstable when the Rossby number exceeds
a critical value Roc which varies as βE1/2 [22]. At the onset, the instability is
a Rossby wave, azimuthal necklace of cyclones and anticyclones of size E1/4
which propagates in the prograde direction as shown in ﬁgure 2ab. Super
rotation (Ro > 0) generates a spiraling ﬂow outside the shear layer while the
ﬂow is mainly located inside the shear layer for Ro < 0. For supercritical Ro,
the ﬂow exhibits larger vortices (ﬁg. 2cd) which are time dependent but still
drifting as Rossby waves. The ﬂow stays mainly concentrated in the shear
layer. Figure 3 shows the kinetic energy spectra E(k) of this QG turbulent
k−5 which is the spectrum predicted by Rhines
ﬂow. It is very steep : E(k)
[25] for turbulence in presence of Rossby waves. This steep spectrum suggests
that the small scales of the ﬂow may be neglected in the induction equation.

4 Dynamo action

For a given Ekman number (E = 10−6 to 10−8), we vary the Rossby number
Ro from critical to a few times critical and we ﬁnd the critical magnetic
Prandtl number Pm of the onset of dynamo action by trial and error tests.
As the ﬂow is time dependent, we detect dynamo criticality on long term
time variations of the magnetic energy. Unlike most of the kinematic dynamo
models [26], a critical magnetic Prandtl number was found for every set of
dimensionless numbers (E, Ro) we have computed. In ﬁgure 4, we plot the
calculated critical magnetic Prandtl number P c
m as function of the Reynolds
number Re = Ro/E. As expected, we found that an increase of the forcing
(Ro) for a given E reduces the critical magnetic Prandtl number. A decrease of
the critical magnetic Prandtl number is also observed as we lower the Ekman
number. These two eﬀects may be summarised by the use of the magnetic
Reynolds number Rm. The data points in ﬁgure 4 are roughly compatible
with the line Rm = 104. A critical magnetic Reynolds number Rc
m of 104 is
only indicative because the details of the ﬂow generate large deviations (factor
3) from this simple law. The minimum critical magnetic Prandtl number of
0.003 has been found for E = 10−8 and Ro = 0.02.

The critical magnetic Prandtl number is not independent of the sign of the
diﬀerential rotation (sign of Ro). This is expected because the ﬂow is quite
diﬀerent in the two cases as shown in ﬁgure 2. A negative diﬀerential rotation
seems to lead to slightly lower dynamo thresholds.

uz(

z)) and symmetric orthoaxial
Antisymmetric axial velocities (uz(z) =
velocities (us,φ(z) = us,φ(
z)) generate two independent families of growing
magnetic ﬁeld in kinematic dynamos known as the dipole and quadrupole fam-
ilies [27]. The geometry of the two families are shown in ﬁgure 5a and 5b : the
dipole family is dominated by an axial dipole, whereas the quadrupole family
exhibit a strong axial quadrupole. Each family has a diﬀerent critical magnetic
Prandtl number. As shown in ﬁgure 4, we found that the dipole family has al-
ways a larger critical magnetic Reynolds number than the quadrupole family.
This result is quite diﬀerent from the conclusion of the work of Sarson and
Busse [28]. Using Kumar and Roberts kinematic dynamos, they found that
prograde spiraling of columns and prograde zonal ﬂows favor dipole magnetic
ﬁelds.

In both families, the strongest magnetic ﬁelds are produced in the Stewart-
son shear layer deep inside the sphere. The typical spectra given in ﬁgure 3
show that the computed magnetic ﬁelds are dominated by both toroidal and
axisymmetric components. At the surface of the sphere (ﬁgure 5c), the radial
magnetic ﬁeld is also mostly axisymmetric, and the non-axisymmetric part
is clearly associated to the geostrophic vortices produced in the Stewartson

The geometry of the magnetic ﬁeld may be understood in term of αΩ eﬀects
[27,8]. A very large toroidal magnetic ﬁeld compatible with the azimuthal ﬂow
is converted to a poloidal magnetic ﬁeld by the columnar ﬂow through an α
eﬀect. Any non azimuthal component of the magnetic ﬁeld is transformed into
an azimuthal component by the strong diﬀerential rotation in the Stewartson
layer by Ω eﬀect.

If we consider the magnetic Reynolds number associated to the shear ﬂow
m = RoPmE−1 and the magnetic Reynolds number based on the vertical
RΩ
m = uzPmE−1k−1 where uz is deduced from the calculation, as well
velocity Rα
as the Rhines wave number k [25]. We may compute the dynamo number Dy =
m [27]. Figure 6 shows that Dy stays roughly constant (between 200 and
300) as the ﬂow becomes more and more vigorous for the quadrupole family.

As proposed by Robert [27], this feature may indicate that we have αΩ′ < 0

Both the geometry and the onset in term of dynamo number Dy indicate

Busse [29] suggested that the Ekman pumping is important for the dynamo
process : although the β-eﬀect produces axial velocities, they are out of phase
with the axial vorticity at the onset of thermal convection in a rapidly rotating
annulus and cannot contribute to the mean helicity, whereas axial velocities
due to Ekman pumping are in phase with the axial vorticity. However, the

Table of the critical magnetic Prandtl numbers for the diﬀerent calculations.

Ekman pumping ﬂow is of order E1/2, so that the dynamo process proposed by
Busse becomes very weak when lowering the Ekman number. In addition, when
artiﬁcially removing the Ekman pumping ﬂow in our dynamo simulations,
we still observe dynamo action with nearly the same threshold. It seems to
indicate that the β-eﬀect alone may produce an eﬃcient α eﬀect, without
requiring an Ekman pumping ﬂow.

Furthermore, we have not been able to ﬁnd a critical magnetic Prandtl num-
ber with a steady ﬂow (either a time averaged ﬂow or a ﬂow with its time
evolution stopped at a given time). It implies that the time evolution of the
ﬂow is a key ingredient for dynamo action in these quasi-geostrophic dynamos.
The propagation of the Rossby waves is required to put in phase the non ax-
isymmetric magnetic ﬁelds and velocities in order to produce a axisymmetric
poloidal magnetic ﬁeld. This type of α eﬀect was proposed in the model of
Braginsky [30]. Currently, many dynamo experiments are designed with the
help of numerical simulations (kinematic dynamos). Even if the ﬂow is highly
turbulent (Re > 106), mean ﬂow approaches are used for simplicity purposes
to ﬁnd the dynamo onset [1,31,32,33]. This method would fail in the case of
Stewartson dynamos.

10

4.1 Oscillating solution

As in many αΩ dynamo [27], we sometimes obtain a time oscillating solution
for the Stewartson dynamo. Dipole solutions for E = 10−6 do exhibit such
a behavior. The growth rate of one of these dynamos is plotted on ﬁgure 7,
showing three time scales : the smallest one is the time scale of the velocity
ﬂuctuations. The intermediate time scale is the time needed for the growth
rate to go from its minimum value to its maximum. The large time scale is
the period of oscillation, not linked to any time scale of the ﬂow.

In the context of kinematic dynamos, this behavior correspond to a complex
eigenvalue of the linear set of equation [27,8,23]. We use the same formalism
to explain our result. It may be explained by two coupled magnetic modes B1
and B2. Let assume that the induction equation may be approximated by the
following system :

with all real values. For low coupling (K12K21 < (λ1
of this system are real, so that the growing solution is a combination of B1
and B2. This is the case for the quadrupole family at Ro < 0. However, when
the coupling K12K21 is suﬃciently strong, the eigenvalues are complex and as
a result the growing magnetic ﬁeld oscillates periodically between B1 and B2.
The intermediate time scale (time for the growth rate to go from its minimum
to its maximum) is very close to the phase shift between B1 and B2, and one
of the two modes is dominant near the minimum of the growth rate cycle,
while the other one is dominant near the maximum, with growth rate close to
λ1 and λ2.

The reversal process at work in our simulations is a smooth periodic evolution
of the magnetic ﬁeld, but at the surface it appears to be a sudden sign reversal.
In fact, a reversed poloidal magnetic ﬁeld is slowly growing inside the Stewart-
son layer, moving away the initial poloidal magnetic ﬁeld until it reaches the
outer boundary. Then, the reversed dipole magnetic ﬁeld suddenly appears at
the surface and ultimately the poloidal ﬁeld reverses at the center. During the
time oscillation, the axisymmetric toroidal magnetic ﬁeld patches in the Stew-
artson layer migrate toward the equator as reversed polarity toroidal ﬁelds are
formed at higher latitudes. This migration could be understood in terms of
Parker dynamo waves [34,27].

5 Conclusion

∼

In summary, we have computed a quasi-geostrophic dynamo based on a Stew-
artson shear layer ﬂow. The scale separation approach works because the small
scales of the ﬂow in our rotating sphere are negligible (very steep kinetic en-
k−5). Our preliminary results may be interpreted in
ergy spectrum E(k)
terms of αΩ dynamo. The Ω eﬀect is done by the shear of the Stewartson layer
itself whereas the α eﬀect is produced by vortices associated with the Rossby
waves due to the instability of the shear layer. These understandings are very
encouraging for our on-going experimental modeling of the geodynamo. As
described in Cardin et al. [35], we are building a spherical Couette experiment
using liquid sodium which may validate and enlarge our present numerical
ﬁndings.

For the ﬁrst time, we have computed a spherical dynamo with a very low
magnetic Prandtl number (< 10−2) and a very low Ekman number (10−8)
(corresponding to a very high Reynolds number Re > 106). Even if our di-
mensionless parameters stay far away from parameters of planetary cores, our
calculations use dimensionless numbers which are in the correct asymptotic
regime for the modeling of the geodynamo. The key ingredients of our ap-
proach is to take into account a speciﬁc property of the rotating ﬂuid (QG)
which allows us to use a 2D model to compute the ﬂow evolution, and the
separation of scales between the magnetic ﬁeld and the velocity ﬁeld, allowing
us to use a coarse 3D mesh for the magnetic ﬁeld.

We also showed that in the case studied in this paper, the mean ﬂow or the
static ﬂow fails to produce a dynamo while the fully resolved time-dependent
ﬂow succeeds. Indeed, the time evolution of the ﬂow and the β eﬀect are key
ingredients for dynamo action in our models, while the Ekman pumping can
be neglected without losing the dynamo eﬀect.

The next step will be to add the Lorentz force in the QG equation to compute
saturated dynamos. One of the diﬃculty is to compute the action of the large
magnetic ﬁeld on the small scale motions of the ﬂuid. Preliminary results
are encouraging and exhibit saturated dynamos very close to the kinematic
dynamos described here.

A quasi geostrophic approach could also be used to build thermal convective
dynamos. A zonal geostrophic ﬂow is produced by the Reynolds stress of the
thermal columns [17,36] but its amplitude is much lower compared to the
diﬀerential rotation imposed in the Stewartson problem. Would it be enough
to start an Stewartson dynamo type? for what forcing? Would it work for very
low Ekman and magnetic Prandtl numbers?

The paper presents a discussion on localization of acoustic waves. Some important questions
about wave localization are addressed. Particular attention is paid to acoustic localization in liquid
media containing many air-ﬁlled bubbles. It is shown that an amazing collective behavior appears
when localization occurs. The study sheds new light to the much discussed subject.

I. INTRODUCTION

When propagating through media containing many scatterers, waves will be scattered by each scatterer. The scat-
tered waves will be scattered again by other scatterers. This process is repeated to establish an inﬁnite recursive
pattern of rescattering between scatterers, forming a multiple scattering process which causes the scattering char-
acteristics of the scatterers to change. Multiple scattering of waves is responsible for a wide range of fascinating
phenomena. This includes, on large scales, twinkling light in the evening sky, modulation of ambient sound at ocean
surfaces [1], acoustic scintillation from turbulent ﬂows [2] and ﬁsh schools [3]. On smaller scales, phenomena such as
white paint, random laser [4], electron transport in impured solids [5] and photonic band gaps in periodic structures [6]
are also explained in terms of multiple scattering. Under proper conditions, multiple scattering leads to a phenomenon
termed localization, which has now become an everyday experience.

Wave localization is a ubiquitous phenomenon. It refers to situations in which transmitted waves in a scattering
medium are trapped in space and will remain conﬁned in the neighborhood of the initial site until dissipated. The
concept of localization was conceived from the theory describing the disorder induced conductor-insulator transition in
electronic systems [7]. Since its inception, wave localization has stimulated considerable interest among scientists from
many areas of disciplinary. Several monographs have been devoted to the subject (e. g. Ref. [8]). Wave localization
may be realized in a variety of situations. In disordered solids, electron localization is common. Localization has
also been reported for microwaves in random scattering rods and spheres [9,10], and recently for light in a ground
gallium-arsenide suspension in methanol [11]. Acoustic localization has also been studied both theoretically [12] and
experimentally [13]. Research suggests that acoustic localization may be observed in bubbly liquids [12,14].

Despite the tremendous eﬀorts, however, no deeper insight into localization has been documented in the literature.
The general cognition remains that enhanced backscattering is a precursor to wave localization and that disorder is
an essential ingredient of localization. Important questions such as how and when the localization occurs stay as an
unsolved puzzle.

In a recent paper [14], we proposed to study wave localization phenomenon by investigating wave propagation in
liquid media containing many air-ﬁlled bubbles. There are several advantages of studying sound in bubbly liquids.
(1) The air-ﬁlled bubbles are strong acoustic scatterer. At low frequencies, about ka ∼ 0.0136, it appears the resonant
scattering and the scattering strength is greatly enhanced at resonance, making it an ideal system to study strong
scattering. Here k is the acoustic wavenumber in water and a is the radius of the bubbles. (2) The scattering function
of a single bubble has been well studied and has a simple form. The scattering function of a spherical bubble can be
found in many textbooks [15], whereas the scattering function of a deformed bubble, such as an ellipsoidal bubble, has
also been analytically derived recently [16]. It is shown that the scattering function of a single bubble has a simple
isotropic resonant form, permitting many simpliﬁcations. Furthermore, perhaps more important, such an isotropic
scattering feature remains valid even as the bubbles are subject to signiﬁcant deformation [16]. (3) Each term in
the scattering function has clear physical meaning, and can be modiﬁed according to the need. When the thermal
exchange and viscosity eﬀects are taken into account, absorption indeed shows up but in a way such that it can be
turned oﬀ or adjusted. This allows to unequivocally isolate localization due to scattering from attenuation caused by
absorption, making waves in bubbly water an ideal system for studying phenomena related to multiple scattering.

In this paper, we ﬁrst discuss general aspects of wave localization in a 3D system. An intuitive picture is proposed
to describe wave localization and is subsequently supported by numerical examples in acoustic propagation in bubbly
liquids. Wave localization is a phase transition. A novel method is proposed to describe such a phase transition. It

is shown that when the localization occurs, all air-ﬁlled bubbles as a resonant scatterer prevail a surprising collective
behavior.

II. GENERAL ASPECTS

dI
dx

= −αI,

dIC

= −γIC ,

Consider a plane wave normally incident upon a semi-inﬁnite random medium. The transport equation for the

total energy intensity I may be intuitively written as

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

where α represents decay along the path traversed. After penetrating into the random medium, the wave will
be scattered by random inhomogeneities. As a result, the wave coherence starts to decrease, yielding the way to
incoherence. Extinction of the coherent intensity IC is described by

with the attenuation constant γ. Eqs. (1) and (2) lead to the exponential solutions

I(x) = I(0)e

−αx,

and IC (x) = I(0)e

−γx.

In deriving these equations, the boundary condition was used; it states that I(0) = IC (0) as no scattering has been
incurred yet at the interface. According to energy conservation, the incoherent intensity ID (diﬀusive) is thus

ID(x) = I(x) − IC (x).

When there is no absorption, the decay constant α is expected to vanish and the total intensity will then be constant
along the propagation path. Then, the coherent energy gradually decreases due to random scattering and transforms
to the diﬀusive energy, while the sum of the two forms of energy remains a constant. This scenario, however, changes
when localization occurs. Even without absorption, the total intensity can be localized near the interface due to
multiple scattering. When this happens, α does not vanish. The transport of the total intensity may be still described
by Eq. (1), and the inverse of α would then refer to the localization length.

The above perceptual description may be illustrated by Fig. 1. Without or with little absorption, the energy
propagation is anticipated to follow the behavior depicted in (a). When the localization comes in sight, the wave
will be trapped within an e-folding distance from the penetration, as prescribed by (b). In the non-localization case,
the diﬀusive intensity increases steadily as more and more scattering occurs, complying with the Milne diﬀusion [15].
In the localized state, the diﬀusion energy increases initially.
It will be eventually stopped by the interference of
multiple scattering waves. Issues may be raised with respect to whether this apprehended image is supported by
actual situations. In the rest, we will inspect this problem by considering acoustic waves in bubbly water.

III. ACOUSTIC LOCALIZATION IN BUBBLY LIQUIDS

Consider sound emission from a bubble cloud. For simplicity, the shape of the cloud is taken as spherical. Such
a model eliminates irrelevant edge eﬀects, and is useful to separate phenomena pertinent to the discussion. Total N
bubbles of the same radius a are randomly distributed within the cloud. The volume void fraction, the space occupied
by bubbles per unit volume, is take as β. A monochromatic acoustic source is located at the center of the cloud.
Adaptation of such a model for other geometries and situations is straightforward. The wave transmitted from the
source propagates through the bubble layer, where multiple scattering incurs, and then it reaches a receiver located
at some distance from the cloud. The multiple scattering in the bubbly layer is described by a set of self-consistent
equations. The energy transmission can be solved numerically in a rigorous fashion [14].

A traditional way to study wave localization is to calculate the Green’s function for the energy transport, leading
to the Bethe-Salpeter equation. Under certain approximations, such as long time and large distance from the initial
site, a solution to this equation can be obtained in the form of a diﬀusion formula in which a mean free path and
diﬀusion coeﬃcient can be deﬁned and have been used as the basis for discussion in the literature. Alternatively,
certain situations allow direct computation of the energy transport, without recourse to unnecessary approximations.
In the case, information about wave propagation can be inferred straightway. Acoustic wave propagation is one of
such situations. The propagation is calculated incorporating all multiple scattering by the self-consistent scheme [14].
In the following, we will inspect the features of acoustic localization from three aspects and then present a discussion.

2

A. Frequency response

First consider the frequency response. In Fig. 2, the transmission in arbitrary units is plotted against frequency
in terms of ka for two diﬀerent bubble sizes. Here k is the usual wavenumber, and the bubble void fraction is 10−3.
It is clearly suggested in the ﬁgure that a narrow region is opened in which the transmission is virtually forbidden.
This inhibition gap ranges roughly from ka = 0.015 to 0.02. When the void fraction is reduced to about 10−5, the
localization disappears [17]. In order to show that the inhibition is not because of absorption, the situation with the
absorption being turned oﬀ is also plotted in the dotted line for a = 2cm. The comparison between with and without
absorption excludes the absorption as the cause for the propagation hindrance. In fact, when the absorption factor
of a single bubble is increased, the localization will be degraded.

B. Distance variation

To unambiguously identify that the transmission inhibition region is indeed the localization range, it is proper to
study the spatial dependence of energy propagation. Fig. 3(a) presents the total transmission and its coherent and
diﬀusive parts, scaled by the geometry spreading factor r2, as a function of propagation distance scaled by the radius
of the bubble cloud. The solid, dotted and broken lines refer to total, diﬀusive and coherent intensity respectively.
The bubble radius is 2 cm, whereas the frequency is taken as ka = 0.171, which lies in the localization regime. When
plotting the data in the natural logarithm in Fig. 3(b), we found that nearly all the data rest on a straight line. In
(b), the straight line refers to the ﬁtted curve and the crosses refer to the numerical data. We ﬁnd the slope for the
line amounts to a constant α = −0.195, which is found to be true for other bubble sizes as well. This suggests that
the intensity varies with propagation distance r as

Therefore the transport equation for the total wave can be written as

which is an equivalence of Eq. (1) in the spherical geometry. The second term on the right hand side of Eq. (6) denotes
the geometrical spreading eﬀect. From Eq. (5), the localization length is computed to be l = 5.13a. At this length,
kl ≈ 0.0877; therefore the Ioﬀe-Regel criterion for localization [8] is satisﬁed, providing another veriﬁcation. At this
frequency we also calculated attenuation length due to thermal and viscosity absorption to be about 118a, which is
much larger than the observed localization length.

The same calculation has also been performed for other sizes of bubbles. We found that within the localization
regime, the ratio between the localization length and the size of bubble is nearly a constant around 5, as long as
the bubble radius is large enough, roughly bigger than 10µm. For too small bubble, the absorption due to thermal
exchange and viscosity eﬀects is signiﬁcant. Then the transmission will be size dependent and therefore the scaling
behavior disappears. These features do not appear for ka outside the localization regime. Fig. 3(a) draws remarkable
analogy to the perception demonstrated in Fig. 1(b).

C. Collective behavior

Upon incidence, each air-bubble acts as a secondary pulsating point source. The radiated wave from the i-th bubble
(i = 1, 2, 3, ..., N ) can be written as AiG0(~r − ~ri), where G0(~r − ~ri) is the usual 3D Green’s function and ~ri denotes
the positions of the bubble. The complex coeﬃcient Ai refers to the eﬀective strength of the secondary source, and is
computed incorporating all multiple scattering eﬀects. The total wave at any space point is the addition of the direct
wave from the transmitting source and the radiated wave from all bubbles.

We express Ai as |Ai| exp(iθi); the modulus Ai represents the strength, whereas θi the phase of the secondary
source. We assign a unit vector ~ui, hereafter termed phase vector, to each phase θi, and these vectors are represented
on an argand diagram in the x − y plane. That is, the starting point of each phase vector is positioned at the center of
individual scatterers with an angle with respect to the positive x-axis equal to the phase, ~ui = cos θi ˆx+sin θi ˆy. Letting
the phase of the initiative emitting source be zero, numerical experiments are carried out to study the behavior of the
phases of the bubbles and the spatial distribution of the acoustic energy. Figure 4 shows the argand diagrams of the

3

phase vectors, and the energy distribution for three frequencies in terms of ka for one arbitrary random conﬁguration
of bubbles.

We observe that for frequencies smaller than a certain value, there is no obvious order for the directions of the phase
vectors, nor for the energy distribution. The phase vectors point to various directions, and no energy localization
appears. The random behavior in the directions and energy distribution is attributed to the boundary eﬀect of a
ﬁnite number of the scatterers. In eﬀect, as the wave is not localized, it can propagate through and is reﬂected by
the asymmetric border; all bubbles can experience the eﬀect via strong multiple scattering.

As the frequency increases, an order in the phase vectors and energy localization becomes evident. The case
with ka = 0.0164 clearly shows that the energy is localized near the source, and amazingly, all bubbles oscillate
completely in phase, but exactly out of phase with the transmitting source. Such collective behavior allows for
eﬃcient cancellation of incoming waves. The energy distribution decays exponentially, which sets the localization
length. The localization behavior is independent of the outer boundary and always appears for suﬃciently large β
and N . When the frequency increases further, exceeding a certain amount, the in-phase order disappears. Meanwhile,
the wave becomes non-localized again. This is illustrated by the case of ka = 0.1.

Further numerical investigation shows that the pattern depicted by Fig. 4 holds qualitatively true for other sizes
of bubble (as long as the bubble is not too small; when the bubble is too small, the viscosity and thermal eﬀects will
dominate and the localization phenomenon will disappear. And the features are always valid for suﬃciently large
bubble void fraction.

D. On localization

Now a question immediately follows: What can we learn about wave localization from the above discussion? First,
wave localization refers to trapping of the total wave energy, which may be indicated by the exponential decay of
transmitted energies along the distance traveled by wave. However, the localization due to the scattering must be
diﬀerentiated from the attenuation due to absorption.
It is well-known that when absorption is present, energies
will also decrease with the traveling distance. Second, when localization occurs, wave is trapped near the point of
transmission. If a continuous wave is pumped into the system, there could be several conjectures. (1) The energy
will be built up in the neighborhood of the transmission point until the amplitude is so large that localization fails.
(2) When the localization occurs, no more energy can be pumped into the system. This scenario may be hinted by
from Fig. 4 which shows that the anti-phase collective behavior allows for eﬃcient cancellation of transmitting waves.
This may be in analogy with situation for the electrical current in a conductor with resistance R that is connected
to a battery with potential V . The electrical power is V 2/R. When added with suﬃcient amount of impurities, the
conductor will become an insulator, i. e. R → ∞. Then the battery can no longer inject power into the medium.
Which scenario describes the actual situation remains an open problem. However, the present study seems to hint at
the second hypothesis.

IV. SUMMARY

In summary, we have considered the behavior of acoustic localization in water containing many air-ﬁlled bubbles,
using a simple numerical model. The localization behavior was investigated and is shown to follow the description of
a simple transport equation. The research provides a fundamental backbone for a simple intuitive picture about wave
localization in random media. A novel approach has been proposed for describing the localization phase transition. It
is shown that a collective behavior appears when wave localization occurs. More detailed discussion of the collective
behavior and a consideration of 2D situations will be published elsewhere [18].

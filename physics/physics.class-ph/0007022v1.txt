Abstract:

It has been shown by Gupta and Padmanabhan that the radiation reaction force of the
Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac equation can be obtained by a coordinate transformation from the
inertial frame of an accelerating charged particle to that of the laboratory. We show that
the problem may be formulated in a ﬂat space of ﬁve dimensions, with ﬁve corresponding
gauge ﬁelds in the framework of the classical version of a fully gauge covariant form of
the Stueckelberg-Feynman-Schwinger covariant mechanics (the zero mode ﬁelds of the
0, 1, 2, 3 components correspond to the Maxwell ﬁelds). Without additional constraints,
the particles and ﬁelds are not conﬁned to their mass shells. We show that in the mass-shell
limit, the generalized Lorentz force obtained by means of the retarded Green’s functions for
the ﬁve dimensional ﬁeld equations provides the classical Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac radiation
reaction terms (with renormalized mass and charge). We also obtain general coupled
equations for the orbit and the oﬀ-shell dynamical mass during the evolution. The theory
does not admit radiation if the particle remains identically on-shell. The structure of the
equations implies that mass-shell deviation is bounded when the external ﬁeld is removed.

Gupta and Padmanabhan4 have shown that the motion of a charged particle in an
electromagnetic ﬁeld can be described in the inertial frame of the particle with a time
varying non-trivial background metric. Using the general covariant form of the Maxwell
equations and transforming back to the inertial frame of the laboratory, they obtained
the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac radiation reaction term as a consequence of this geometrical
picture. This result demonstrates that the description of the motion of a charged particle
in acceleration must include the radiation terms of the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac equation5.
Alternatively, one can develop the mechanics in a ﬂat space of higher dimension, an
approach that we shall take. We shall work with the manifestly covariant mechanics of
Stueckelberg6, which provides a description of dynamical systems under the inﬂuence of
forces (which may be represented in terms of potentials or gauge ﬁelds) in a framework
which is Lorentz covariant. This theory admits, on a classical level, deviations from the
particle’s mass shell during interaction, as in quantum ﬁeld theory. A similar approach
was used by Mendon¸ca and Oliveira e Silva7, who studied the motion of a relativistically
kicked oscillator in the E, t plane using what they called a “super Hamiltonian.” One can,
in fact derive the relativistic Lorentz force

m¨xµ = F µ

ν ˙xν

from such a Hamiltonian.

Consider the Hamiltonian5,6(we take c = 1 henceforth)

K =

(pµ − eAµ(x))(pµ − eAµ(x))

2M

(1)

(2),

where x ≡ xµ. The Hamilton equations (generalized to the four-dimensional symplectic
mechanics6) are

(3)

where τ is the absolute (universal) invariant time parametrizing the path of the particle in
spacetime6. Computing dpµ
from the ﬁrst of these, one ﬁnds Eq. (1). It moreover follows
dτ
from the ﬁrst of Eqs.(3) that

dxµ

dxµ

=

(pµ − eAµ(x))(pµ − eAµ(x))

M 2

;

(4)

this quantity is absolutely conserved, since K does not depend explicitly on τ . It follows,
since the square of the proper time ds2 = −dxµdxµ, that ds is proportional to dτ , inde-
pendently of the acceleration of the particle. The numerator of (4) is the mass-squared of
the particle; we infer that this result is associated with the restriction of the particle to a
sharp mass shell.

Taking into account full U (1) gauge invariance, the Stueckelberg-Schr¨odinger

equation6 (including a compensation ﬁeld for the τ -derivative) is

∂
∂τ

(cid:0)i

+ e0a5(cid:1)ψτ (x) =

(pµ − e0aµ(x, τ ))(pµ − e0aµ(x, τ ))

2M

ψτ (x),

(5)

where the gauge ﬁelds may depend on τ and e0 is a dimensionless coupling. The corre-
sponding classical Hamiltonian then has the form

K =

(pµ − e0aµ(x, τ ))(pµ − e0aµ(x, τ ))

2M

− e0a5(x, τ ).

(6)

The equations of motion for the ﬁeld variables are given (for both the classical and quantum
theories) by8

λ∂αf βα(x, τ ) = e0jβ(x, τ ),

(7)

where α, β = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, the last corresponding to the τ index, and λ, of dimension ℓ−1, is
a factor on the terms f αβfαβ in the Lagrangian associated with (6) (including degrees of
freedom of the ﬁelds), required by dimensionality, as we shall see below. The ﬁeld strengths
are

and the current satisﬁes the conservation law8,10

f αβ = ∂αaβ − ∂βaα,

∂αjα(x, τ ) = 0.

Writing out (9) explicitly (j5 ≡ ρ, the density of events in spacetime),

∂5ρ + ∂µjµ = 0;

(8)

(9)

(10)

integrating over τ on (−∞, ∞), and assuming that j5(x, τ ) vanishes8 at |τ| → ∞, one ﬁnds
that

∂µJ µ(x) = 0,

where (for some dimensionless η)

J µ(x) = ηZ ∞

−∞

dτ jµ(x, τ ).

(11)

We identify this J µ(x) with the Maxwell conserved current. In ref. 9, for example, this
expression occurs with

jµ(x, τ ) = ˙xµ(τ )δ4(x − x(τ )),

(12)

and τ is identiﬁed with the proper time of the particle (an identiﬁcation which can be
made for the motion of a free particle).

Integrating the µ-components of Eq. (7) over τ (assuming f µ5(x, τ ) → 0 for τ → ±∞),
we obtain the Maxwell equations with the Maxwell charge e = e0/η and the Maxwell ﬁelds
given by

aµ(x, τ ) dτ.

(13)

Aµ(x) = λZ ∞

−∞

3

The Hamiltonian of Stueckelberg6 and Mondon¸ca and Oliveira e Silva8 can be recovered
in the limit of the zero mode of the ﬁelds

aµ(x, τ ) = Z dsˆaµ(x, s)e−isτ .

(14)

In the zero mode limit, when the Fourier transform of the ﬁelds have support only in the
neighborhood ∆s of s = 0, the vector potential takes on the form aµ(x, τ ) ∼ ∆sˆaµ(x, 0) =
(∆s/2πλ)Aµ(x), and we identify e = (∆s/2πλ)e0. The zero mode therefore emerges when
the inverse correlation length of the ﬁeld satisﬁes the relation η∆s = 2πλ. We remark
that in this limit, the ﬁfth equation obtained from (7) decouples; the zero mode of the
τ derivative of aµ(x, τ ) vanishes.
If the parameter λ is independent of the dynamical
structure of the ﬁelds, then the eﬀective width of ˆaµ(x, s), when it is well-deﬁned, aﬀects
the value of the charge e, as well as the relation between the eﬀective Maxwell current and
the microscopic current jµ.This eﬀect, occurring when a Maxwell type theory is a good
approximation, can be understood as a classical analog of charge renormalization, where
the eﬀective charge is a function of momentum transfer.

Again, writing the Hamilton equations for the Hamiltonian (6), we ﬁnd the generalized

Lorentz force10

(15)

(16)

this equation therefore does not necessarily lead to the trivial relation between ds and dτ
discussed above in connection with Eq. (4). The f µ
5 term has the eﬀect of moving the
particle oﬀ-shell.

In the following we use the Green’s functions for (7) to calculate the radiation reaction
force directly, as, for example, in the derivation of Sokolov and Ternov11. In the limit for
which the particle stays on its mass shell during the interaction, we show that this formula
reduces to the known Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac formula9,12 for the Maxwell self-interaction
problem. We furthermore show that the deviation from mass shell is stable. We shall use
the retarded Green’s function and treat divergences by renormalization of charge and the
mass parameter M .

Choosing the generalized Lorentz gauge ∂αaα = 0, Eq. (7) becomes

λ∂α∂αaβ(x, τ ) = (σ∂2

τ − ∂2

t + ▽2)aβ = −e0jβ(x, τ ),

(17)

where σ = ±1 corresponds to the possible choices of metric for the symmetry O(4, 1) or
O(3, 2) of the homogeneous ﬁeld equations.
The Green’s functions for Eq. (17) can be constructed from the inverse Fourier trans-

form

G(x, τ ) =

(2π)5 Z d4kdκ

ei(kµxµ+σκτ )
kµkµ + σκ2 .

(18)

Integrating this expression over all τ gives the Green’s function for the standard Maxwell
ﬁeld. Assuming that the radiation reaction acts causally in τ , we shall restrict our attention
here to the τ -retarded Green’s function. In his calculation of the radiation corrections to
the Lorentz force, Dirac12 used the diﬀerence between advanced and retarded Green’s
functions in order to cancel the singularities that they contain. One can, alternatively11,
use the retarded Green’s function and “renormalize” the mass in order to eliminate the
singularity. In our analysis, we follow the latter procedure.

The τ - retarded Green’s function is given by multiplying the principal part of the
integral (18) by θ(τ ). Carrying out the integrations (on a complex contour in κ; we
consider the case σ = +1 in the following), one ﬁnds (this Green’s function diﬀers from
that used in ref. 13, constructed on a complex contour in k0)

With the help of this Green’s function, the solutions of Eq. (17) for the self-ﬁelds can

(20)

where we have used (12) (along with j5(x, τ ) = δ4(x−x(τ ))). We have written this Green’s
function as a scalar, acting in the same way on all ﬁve components of the source jα; to
assure that the resulting ﬁeld is in Lorentz gauge, however, it should be written as a ﬁve
β − kαkβ/k2 (k5 = κ) included in the integrand. Since
by ﬁve matrix, with the factor δα
we are computing only the gauge invariant ﬁeld strengths here, this extra term will not
inﬂuence any of the results.

From (8) and (15), it then follows that the generalized Lorentz force for the self-action

(the force of the ﬁelds generated by the world line on a point xµ(τ ) of the trajectory) is

We now expand the integrands in Taylor series around the most singular point τ = τ ′.
In this neighborhood, keeping the lowest order terms in τ ′′ = τ − τ ′, the variable u reduces
to u ∼= ˙xµ ˙xµτ ′′2. We shall also use the following deﬁnition;

ε ≡ 1 + ˙xµ ˙xµ,

may therefore expand xµ(τ )− xµ(τ ′) and ˙xµ(τ )− ˙xµ(τ ′) in (27) in power series in τ ′′, and
write the integrals formally with inﬁnite limits.
Substituting (27) into (16), we obtain (note that xµ and its derivatives are evaluated
at the point τ , and are not subject to the τ ′′ integration), after integrating by parts using

must use Eq. (29) to compute the oﬀ-shell mass shift ε corresponding to the longitudinal

the motion orthogonal to the four velocity. Equations (29) and (35) are the fundamental
dynamical equations governing the oﬀ-shell orbit.

This result is of the form of the standard relativistic Lorentz force with radiation

We now study the stability of the variations of the oﬀ-shell parameter ε when the
external ﬁeld is removed. First, we construct an equation of motion for ε. We deﬁne the

We ﬁrst study the possibilty of having a solution of the form ε ≡ ε0, a constant. In

this case ¨ε = 0 implies,

˙xµ...

x µ = −¨xµ ¨xµ.

Since all the derivatives of ε are zero we also ﬁnd from (44),

...

¨xµ

= 0

. Multiplying eq.(35) by ¨xµ and substituting these last two results we get

From (42) we ﬁnd then that

From (41) and (26b), one sees that this equation can be satisﬁed only if ε = 0 (F1 = 0) or
ε = 1 (F3 = ∞).
implies

Since ˙ε = 0 we ﬁnd that ˙t2¨t2 = | ˙x|2|¨x|2cos2θ. Together with ¨xµ ¨xµ = ¨t2 −|¨x2| = 0 this

˙t2¨t2 = | ˙x|2¨t2 cos2 θ

The solution ¨t = |¨x| = 0 implies ˙xµ = const . The other solution ˙t2 = | ˙x|2 cos2 θ implies
that | ˙x|2(1 − cos2 θ) = ε − 1; since the left hand side is positive, ε cannot be zero, and the
only possibility for a constant solution is then ε = 1, motion on the light cone. We shall
show below that the trajectory cannot reach this bounday.

The mass shell condition ε = 0, in the theoretical framework we have given here,
implies that the particle motion must be with constant velocity, and that no radiation
(¨xµ ¨xµ = 0) is possible, i.e., in order to radiate, the particle must be oﬀ-shell. This result

10

is also true in the presence of an external ﬁeld. In particular, it follows from Eq. (29) that

For the case ε < 0 the function F3 is zero at ε = −0.735. In this case eq.(42) becomes

If ˙ε > 0 at this value of ε, then ε cannot cross this boundary. Since F1(−0.735) = .624

Setting M, e equal to the electron mass (the lowest mass charged particle) and charge one
ﬁnds that µ > 10−23sec, a cut-oﬀ of reasonable size for a classical theory.

We now show that ǫ is bounded from above by unity. The full classical Hamiltonian,
obtained by adding the contribution of the ﬁelds to the expression on the right hand side
of (6), is a conserved quantity. In the absence of external ﬁelds, all the ﬁeld quantities are
related to the source particle through the Green’s functions. In the absence of external
ﬁelds, as the particle motion approaches the light cone, there are inﬁnite contributions
arising from the ﬁelds evaluated on the particle trajectory. In this case, it follows from
(4) that (pµ−e0aµ(x,τ ))(pµ−e0aµ(x,τ ))
= 0. The a5 self-ﬁeld term is less singular than the
fµν f µν and fµ5f µ

squared. As seen from (26b), the most singular contribution arises from f1
total Hamiltonian K is conserved, the coeﬃcient of this singularity must vanish. The
coeﬃcients involve just ˙ε (and its square) and ¨ε; one ﬁnds a simple nonlinear diﬀerential
equation for which only ˙ε = 0 can be a solution.
It follows that the conservation law
restricts the evolution of ε to values less than unity, i.e. the particle trajectory cannot
pass through the light cone.

2M

This bound manifests itself in the structure of the diﬀerential equation (45) for ε. In
the limit that ε → 1, the coeﬃcients A, B, C, D are all ﬁnite; however the behavior of the
linearized solution depends on the derivates of these coeﬃcients, and, in this limit, B′ is
singular, driving the solution away from the light cone.

Numerical studies are under way to follow the motion of this highly nonlinear system

both in the presence and absence of external ﬁelds.

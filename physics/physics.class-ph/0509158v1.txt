We analyze the time reversal of a multiple-
input-multiple-output (MIMO) system in a space-
frequency-selective multi-path fading channel de-
scribed by the stochastic Schr¨odinger equation
with a random potential in the strong-ﬂuctuation
regime. We prove that in a broadband limit the
conditions for stable super-resolution are the pack-
ing condition that the spacing among the N trans-
mitters and M receivers be more than the coher-
ence length ℓc and the consecutive symbols in the
data-streams are separated by more than the in-
1 and the multiplexing
verse of the bandwidth B−
condition that the number of the degrees of free-
N B) be
dom per unit time at the transmitters (
much larger than the number of the degrees of free-
dom (
M C) per unit time in the ensemble of in-
tended messages. Here C is the number of sym-
bols per unit time in the data-streams intended for
each receiver. When the two conditions are met, all
receivers receive simultaneously streams of statis-
tically stable, sharply focused signals intended for
them, free of fading and interference. This indi-
cates the rough multiplexing gain of N B in channel
capacity, with the maximal gain per unit angular
cross section given by BLdℓ−
c where L is the dis-
tance from the transmitters to the receivers. We
show that under the ideal packing condition time
reversal can result in a high signal-to-interference
ratio and low probability of intercept, and hence
is an eﬀective means for achieving the information
capacity of multi-path channels in the presence of
multiple users (receivers).

Introduction

Time reversal (TR) of waves is the process of recording
the signal from a remote source and then retransmitting the
signal in a time-reversed fashion to refocus on the source

(see [13] and the references therein). The performance
of TR depends on, among other factors, the reciprocity
(or time symmetry) of the propagation channel. One of
the most striking features of time reversal operation in a
strongly scattering medium is super-resolution, the coun-
terintuitive eﬀect of scattering-enhancement of time rever-
sal resolution [4], [1], [11]. It highlights the great potential
of time reversal in technological applications such as com-
munications where the ability of steering and pinpointing
signals is essential for realizing the information carrying
capacity of a multi-path channel as well as achieving low
probability of intercept [5], [20].

In order to take full advantage of the super-resolution
eﬀect in a random medium, one has to ﬁrst achieve sta-
tistical stability which can be measured by the signal-to-
interference ratio (SIR) and the signal-to-sidelobe ratio
(SSR). Statistical stability and resolution are two closely re-
lated issues that should be analyzed side-by-side; together,
they are the measure of performance of TR which depends
on, but is not guaranteed by, the reciprocity (or time sym-
metry) of the propagation channel.
It has been demon-
strated experimentally that there are at least two routes to
achieving statistical stability [6], [4]. One route is to use a
time-reversal array (TRA) of suﬃciently large aperture; the
other is to use a broadband signal (even with one-element
TRA of essentially zero aperture). There has been many
advances in analytical understanding of the former situa-
tion (see [8] and references therein). In many interesting
applications of time reversal, however, the aperture of TRA
is typically small compared to the correlation length of the
medium, therefore the technological potential of time rever-
sal hinges more heavily on the second route to statistical
stability. Compared to the case of large aperture the an-
alytical understanding of the case of broadband signals in
time reversal has been so far much less complete with the
exception of a randomly layered medium [1].

In this paper we present the time reversal analysis for the
MIMO broadband channel whose k-component is described

The stochastic parabolic wave equation (1) is a funda-
mental equation for wave propagation in a randomly in-
homogeneous continuum such as underwater acoustic and
electromagnetic waves in atmospheric turbulence [17], [28]
as an approximation to the wave equation with random co-
eﬃcients when backscattering and depolarization are weak.
It also models the cross-phase-modulation in nonlinear op-
tical ﬁbers in the wavelength-division-multiplexing scheme
[18]. It has a certain degree of universality and encapsu-
lates the spatial aspect of wave physics, a primary focus of
the present work, which is lacking in analysis based on ei-
ther randomly layered media or random matrix theory [30],
[14], [27]. Here eq. (1) is treated as a model equation for
continuous random media and is studied rigorously here to
extract useful insights that may shed light on other types
of complex media.

Our goal is to show that for the channel described by

Our main theorem says that in the strong-ﬂuctuation
regime and the broadband limit (3) the MIMO-TRA sys-
tem achieves stable super-resolution in the sense that both
the SIR and SSR tend to inﬁnity and that the signal re-
ceived by each receiver is focused to within a circle of the
coherence length ℓc when the additional multiplexing con-

dition is also met, namely N B

To further understand the meaning and implication of
the result, we may assume without loss of generality that
the timing of the data-streams are within one interval of
the delay spread since the signals separated by much more
than one delay spread are roughly uncorrelated. Because
(cf. the section entitled From
the delay spread δ
SISO to MIMO), T βc is roughly the number of symbols
per unit time in each data-stream and hence M T βc is the
number of the degrees of freedom per unit time in the en-
semble of all data-streams while N B is the total number
of the degrees of freedom per unit time at the TRA. The
multiplexing condition says that the number of degrees of
freedom of the intended messages must be smaller than
the number of degrees of freedom available in the channel.
The main technical ingredient of our approach is the exact,
universal low Fresnel number asymptotic obtained for the
two-frequency mutual coherence function. The calculation
is tight indicating that the multiplexing condition is sharp.

on this in the Conclusion).

In what follows, we ﬁrst formulate the problem and
develop the essential tool
for analyzing TR, the one-
and two-frequency mutual coherence functions, and then
carry out the stability and resolution analysis for the
single-input-single-output (SISO), multiple-output-single-
output (MISO), single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) and
the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) cases. Both
MISO- and SIMO-TRA systems have been demonstrated
to be feasible for ocean acoustic communication [23], [7],
[19] and the MIMO-TRA system with N > M has been
shown to work well for ultrasound [5]. We will discuss the
implications of our results on the channel capacity in the
Conclusion. We have by and large neglected the eﬀect of
noise in our analysis, assuming that the TRA operates in
a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) situation as is the case
for the experiments reported in [5], [7]. The robustness of
TR in the presence of noises has been well documented, see
e.g. [24].

the case of ﬁnite time-window), the signal arriving at the

For simplicity, we have assumed that all the receivers lie

Several remarks are in order: (i) The Green function for ΓL

nature of the limit β

The

Fourth order
ﬂuctuation regime α
1 can result from ei-

ther long distance propagation and/or large medium ﬂuc-
tuation.
It is widely accepted that, in this regime, the
statistics of the wave ﬁelds (for at least lower moments)
become Gaussian-like resulting in, for d = 2, an expo-
[26],
nential PDF for the intensity [16],
[25]. The Gaussian statistics follows heuristically from
Central-Limit-Theorem as the number of uncorrelated sub-
channels (paths) per transverse dimension in the cross sec-
increases linearly with the spatial-
tion of diameter σ
∗
spread-bandwidth product, as explained in the Introduc-
tion. This is consistent with the experimental ﬁnding of
the saturation of intensity ﬂuctuation with the scintillation
index approaching unity [17].

[15],

In what follows we shall make the 4-th order sub-
Gaussianity hypothesis, namely that the fourth moments
of the Green function at diﬀerent frequencies
can
be estimated by those of the Gaussian process of the same
covariance. More speciﬁcally, we assume that

Conclusion and discussion

The strong-ﬂuctuation regime constitutes the so called
space-frequency-selective multi-path fading channels in
wireless communications [22]. In such a channel, TR has
the super-resolution given by ℓc = γ/√D2L. We have es-
tablished ﬁrmly the packing and multiplexing conditions
for stable super-resolution for the MIMO-TRA communica-
tion system under the 4-th order sub-Gaussianity assump-
tion. The experimental evidence for our result in the case
of M = 1 has been demonstrated in [4].

6

∼

N Bβ−

We have argued that statistical stability is crucial for
multi-receiver TR communications, especially when the
multiple receivers do not have channel state information,
as the multiuser interference is essentially indistinguish-
able from the intended signal, the only diﬀerence being
their statistical properties. The latter is in the mean ﬁeld
while the former is primarily in the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld. Our
result implies that the time-reversal communication can be
1
1
realized stably in principle with up to M
c T −
receivers simultaneously at the rate T βc with low proba-
bility of intercept due to super-resolution. Concerning the
channel capacity, our result is analogous to the ﬁnding in
[14], [30], [21], [27] based on the random matrix model-
ing and theory that the ergodic capacity with complete
channel state information at the receiver with M receive
antennas (but not at the N transmit antennas) scales like
min (M, N ) log2 SNR (per unit frequency) at high SNR. Af-
ter taking into account the frequency multiplexing gain [2],
[30], the multi-frequency channel capacity then scales like
B min (M, N ) log2 SNR. Note, however, this result does
not include the interference due to noncooperating mul-
tiuser receivers as we do here. Also, these works consider
only narrow-band signals for which statistical stability is
rarely valid in practice and consequently the ergodic ca-
pacity is an average, not almost sure, quantity.

In the present set-up with the B-band-limited channel

state information at the transmitters but not the receivers,
the multiplexing gain is, up to a logarithmic factor, roughly
BN , the number of degrees of freedom per unit
M T βc ∼
time at TRA (see [10] for more analysis on TR capacity
in multi-path Rayleigh fading channels). The packing con-
dition also points to the maximal capacity per unit an-
c Ld log2 (SNR) when N reaches

Let us point out several possible extensions of our results.

d
∗

γ−

First, the case of even broader bandwidth of 0 < lim Bγ
≤
1 can easily be treated by partitioning the full passband
into many sub-bands with their own B and γ satisfying (3).
Since the self-averaging takes place in each sub-band and
the whole process is linear, stable super-resolution is valid
in the full passband. Second, in the case of a ﬁnite time-
window, the out-put signals, unlike (2), involve a coupling
of nearby wavenumbers [12]. If the time window is suﬃ-
ciently large,
, then the coupling takes place only be-
tween wavenumbers of separation much smaller than βc and
our result carries over without major adjustment. Finally,
our results may also be extended to time-varying channels,
prevalent in mobile wireless communications, with a low
1 where Tc is the coherence time
spread factor T −
[22].

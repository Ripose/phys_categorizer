A non-markovian stochastic model is shown to lead to a universal relationship between particle’s
energy, driven frequency and a frequency of interaction with the medium. It is brieﬂy discussed the
possible relevance of this general structure to various phenomena in the context of the formation
of patterns in granular media, computation in a Brownian-type computer and the Haisch-Rueda-
Puthoﬀ inertial mass theory.

INTRODUCTION

The study of physical systems with non-markovian sta-
tistical properties has provided a natural basis for the
understanding of the role played by memory eﬀects in
such diﬀerent ﬁelds as anomalous transport in turbu-
lent plasmas [1], Brownian motion of macroparticles in
complex ﬂuids [2], in the vortex solid phase of twinned
YBa2Cu3O7 single crystals [3]. Recently, experimental
evidence were reported of the quantum jumps of parti-
cles in the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld [4] giving a strong
evidence that jumping process is quite ubiquitous in nat-
ural processes. Thus, it becomes interesting to inquire:
how the medium interaction, perturbing the free motion
of a particle, leaves its own signature?

It is the purpose of this paper to provides the main
lines of a derivation of what we believe to be a nontriv-
ial property of the jumping process particles undergo,
whenever they move in a perturbing medium. The idea
is to put a particle moving straight in a discrete planar
geometry, jumping from one site to another and, in the
meanwhile, subject to a random interaction.

It is found that a universal and structurally very simple
expression of the particle’s energy prevails, intrinsically
linked to the generation of such properties as the mass
of a particle and the build-up of regular geometrical pat-
terns.

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we
introduce, for completeness, the basic features of a non-
markovian stochastic model. It is then shown that the
classical particle’s energy must be proportional to the
squared driven frequency over a frequency of dissipation
in the medium; in particular, whenever the particle’s dy-
namics is described by a planar wave, the de Broglie re-
lationship is retrieved. In Section 3, the evidence of the
referred general structure of the particle’s energy is in-
tuitively discussed in several branches of physics. We
believe that the relationship between driving frequency

of a given process and its corresponding frequency of in-
teraction with a medium provides a method for a general
approach to dissipative systems and is able to predict a
class of new relations.

II.

INFINITE MEMORY MODEL

In a non-markovian model the prediction about the
next link (xn+1) are deﬁned in terms of mutually de-
pendent random variables in the chain (x1, x2,...,xn).
Consider a particle jumping from one site to another in
Euclidean space. We will address here the much simple
situation of a deterministic jump process along a given
direction. The jumping sites are assumed to be equidis-
tantly distributed along the axis. Now, add to this jump-
ing process an oscillatory motion due to interaction with
a medium and characterized by stochasticity. The fre-
quency of oscillation around an equilibrium position be-
tween two jumps is denoted by ν and β is the probability
that each oscillation in the past has to trigger a new os-
cillation in the present. The simplicity of the described
geometry is to same extent well justiﬁed by the recent
experiments done by Nesvizhevsky and collaborators [4].
Ultracold neutrons in a vertical fall subject to a constant
acceleration due to gravity, were shown do not move con-
tinuously, but rather jump from one height to another in
quantum leaps.

Let Qm[q(t)] be the probability that one oscillation
from the M = m0 + ... + mq−1 which occurred in the
past generates m oscillations at the qth step. Since we
assume β is constant, this is an inﬁnite memory model,
meaning that an oscillation which has occurred long time
ago produces the same eﬀect as an oscillation which has
occurred in the near past. Lets introduce the probability
density, Qn(t)dt, that the nth oscillation takes place in
the interval of time (t, t + dt) at qth step. Then

to the hidden interactions the particle undergo with the
medium, we treat the time of an oscillation as a random
variable following a Poisson distribution

probability that M previous oscillations generate mq os-
cillations at qth step [5]. The Bose-Einstein distribution
is favored since many oscillations can pertain to the same

But E = mc2, inasmuch as Einstein’s relationship holds

get the following universal and structurally very simple
expression for the mass

(22)

The integer n allow the possible existence of sub-
harmonics in the energy spectrum. So far, the above
equation belongs to a set of structural relationship be-
tween some physical concepts: energy, driven frequency
ω and dissipative frequency ν. In fact, ν embodies the
degree of interaction with the medium, but β is intrinsi-
cally related to the structure of the medium itself. Hence,

3

the non-markovian character of the stochastic process is
related to the nature of the medium rather than the past
history of the particle.

The medium perturbation is characterized by ν shap-
ing the coeﬃcient m in a slightly diﬀerent pattern than
the well known quantum mechanical expression for a pho-
ton packet (E = ~ω). Note that Eq. 22 is consistent with
the De Broglie relation for free particles (planar waves),
since then ω = ν (resonance condition). Otherwise, the
dissipation in the medium must be taken into account
to verify a diﬀerent relationship for the particles energy,
that is, Eq. 22. We would like to point out that, in as
much as a quantitative correlation is match between a
source system (providing the periodic force which deliv-
ers energy to a given process) and an interactive medium,
our Eq. 22 has a possible connection with the generalized
Nyquist relation [7]. Also, it is worth to remark that our
main result is not merely a bookkeeping of phenomena,
but it traduces a balance between two diﬀerent physical
mechanisms related to the driving force and interactive
process.

III. APPLICATION IN VARIOUS BRANCHES
OF PHYSICS

Having presented the mainframe of the inﬁnite mem-
ory model, we give now some illustrations upon our point
of view that it is possible to achieve an understanding of
some physical phenomena in, possibly, a wide range. In
the examples given below the general structure described
by Eq. 22 seems to govern geometrical patterns in gran-
ular media, inertial eﬀects in stochastic electrodynamics
and minimal energy expenditure in computational ther-
modynamics.

All phenomena hereby referred share the same imprint
of a stochastic interaction with a medium, building-up a
given physical structure.

A. Spheres packing and gravitational surface waves

Granular matter consists of macroscopic particles of
diﬀerent size, shape and surface properties and those
characteristics lead to speciﬁc packing behavior. Parti-
cle clustering results from an energy loss associated with
particle-particle interactions. This interesting and fasci-
nating behavior can be described by the inﬁnite memory
model and the constitutive equation embodied in 22. To
probe it, we start by rearranging Eq. 22 in the form

λ =

mc2v
hf 2 =

Ev
h

f 2 =

gef f
f 2

.

(23)

Here, we deﬁned v = λν
h as an eﬀec-
tive acceleration. λ is the wavelength associated to the
geometrical pattern observed. Detailed experiments on
spheres packing of diameter d in 2 and 3 dimensions have

2π and gef f = Ev

shown [8] the display of repetitive geometric patterns,
similar to the instabilities reported by Faraday.

Actually, it was observed a dependence of the wave-
length of those geometrical patterns and the frequency of
excitation f imposed vertically on a thin layer of granular
matter. Both are related through the equation

manifestation of Eq. 22. In fact, Eq. 25 represents the
minimum energy that must be expended per computa-
tional step in a given process. We have actually a new
deep insight to our Eq. 22: it results from the best match
between energy cost versus speed. It is a by-product of
minimum principles.

λ = λmin +

gef f
f 2

,

(24)

where λmin represents a threshold near 11d, with d de-
noting the particles diameter. Incidentally, gravitational
waves in the surface of a ﬂuid have the same depen-
dency [9].

The two main mechanisms governing the phenomena
are the direct excitation of surface waves and a mecha-
nism of successive bifurcations resulting from the excita-
tions due to the vibrations of granular matter. In fact,
memory-eﬀects have been experimentally shown to occur
in granular materials [10].

B. Computation in a Brownian-type computer

The work on classical, reversible computation has laid
the foundation for the development of quantum mechan-
ical computers.

In 1961 Landauer analyzed the physical limitations on
computation due to dissipative processes [11]. He showed
that energy loss could be made as small as you want, pro-
vided the device works inﬁnitesimally slowly. In fact, it
is shown that the ﬁrst condition for any deterministic
device to be reversible is that its input and output be
uniquely recoverable from each other - this is the con-
dition of logical reversibility. If, besides this condition,
a device can actually run backwards, then it is called
physically reversible and it dissipates no heat, according
to the second law of thermodynamics.

An example of reversible computing involves a copy-
ing machine, for example. Feynman derived a formula
estimating the amount of free energy it takes to realize a
computation in a given interval of time [12]. Envisioning
a computer designed to run by a diﬀusion process, char-
acterized by a slightly higher probability to run forward
than backwards, Feynman proposed the relationship to
hold

E = kBT

tm
ta

.

(25)

Here, E is the energy loss per step, kBT is thermal en-
ergy, tm and ta are, resp., the minimum time taken per
step and the time per step actually taken.
It is easily
seen that the kBT = ~ω holds true since thermal energy
is the driven process and ω = 2π

Eq. 25 is only approximative, we view in it a particular

C. Haisch-Rueda-Puthoﬀ inertial mass theory

Based on stochastic electrodynamics, Haisch, Rueda
and Puthoﬀ [13] put in evidence the relationship between
the zero-point ﬁeld (ZPF) and inertia. ZPF is uniform
and isotropic in inertial frames, while showing asymme-
tries when viewed in accelerated frames. Applying a tech-
nique developed formerly by Einstein and Hopf [14] and
which is at the foundation of stochastic electrodynam-
ics, the charged particles constituent of matter (partons
or quarks) were driven to oscillate at velocity vosc by
the electric component of the ZPF, EZP , thereby accel-
erating in a direction perpendicular to the oscillations
induced by the ZPF. The action of the magnetic compo-
nent of the ZPF generate a Lorentz force whose average
value is given by

They interpreted this result as an account for inertia and
the inertial mass, mi, is shown to be a function of the
damping constant for the oscillations and ωc, the char-
acteristic frequency of particle-ZPF interactions:

mi =

(27)

In the above expression, Γ =
6πǫ0m0c2 is the Abraham-
Lorentz radiation damping constant appearing on the
nonrelativistic equation of motion for a particle of mass
m0 and charge q when submitted to the zero-point radia-
πc5
tion electric ﬁeld; ωc =
~G is the eﬀective Planck cut-
oﬀ frequency of the vacuum zero-point-ﬂuctuation spec-
trum [15]. This idea is rooted in a former publication by
Sakharov [16] envisioning gravitation as resulting from a
small disturbance of the metrical elasticity of space.

q

Comparing Eq. 27 with Eq. 22, it is clear that those ex-
pressions have the same structure. Interestingly, Puthoﬀ
and collaborators conjectured that their interpretation of
mass as resulting from a resonance with the ZPF leads
directly to the de Broglie relation [17]. In their inter-
pretation, inertia is a kind of electromagnetic drag that
aﬀects charged particles undergoing acceleration through
the electromagnetic zero-point ﬁeld. In fact, according to
the de Broglie perspective, the inertial mass of a particle
is the vibrational energy divided by c2 of a localized os-
cillating ﬁeld. It is not an intrinsic property but instead
a measure of the degree of coupling with a localized ﬁeld
(already, in his own view, of electromagnetic origin).

However, it will be noted that our analysis gives evi-
dence of a more complex structure although, when the
resonant condition is veriﬁed, it collapses to the well-
known the Broglie relation.

IV. CONCLUSION

Exploring the underlying transport mechanism of a
test particle with inﬁnite memory induces us to attribute
a universal and structurally simple property to the par-
ticle’s energy, embodied in Eq. 22. In our interpretation,
in a perturbative medium the particle’s energy results
from a balance between the driven frequency ω and a

5

frequency of interaction in the medium, ν. In the partic-
ular case of planar waves this result is consistent with de
Broglie wavelength relationship.

Our approach incorporates the fundamental properties
of dynamics and how deeply rooted in natural phenomena
is this general structure, it is illustrated in various objects
and diﬀerent kind of ﬁelds.

Abstract

A ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) numerical analysis is used to demonstrate that a toroidal

solenoid, coaxial with an electric dipole, is a remarkable non-radiating conﬁguration. It can be used

to measure the dielectric permittivity of any ambient matter. It becomes a directional radiator

at an interface between two dielectric media, depositing energy in the material with the highest

polarizability.

INTRODUCTION

Toroidal and supertoroidal structures are widely present in nature and a supertoroid

was explicitly drawn by Leonardo in 1490. The simplest examples of such objects would

be toroidal solenoids with currents in them. More generally, fractal complications of the

simple toroidal wiring known as supertoroidal structures are discussed and toroidal arrange-

ments of electric and magnetic dipoles have been discussed in the literature. Today the

main biological journals feature an increasing number of papers on proteins, viruses and

phages possessing elements of toroidal and supertoroidal symmetry. At the same time we

witness a growing stream of theoretical papers on the electrodynamics and optics of toroidal

and supertoroidal currents, toroidal nanostructures, toroidal microscopic moments and in-

teractions of electromagnetic ﬁelds with toroidal conﬁguration [1]. Recent studies of phase

transitions in ferroelectric nanodisks and nanorods [2] and toroidal arrangements of spins

in magnetic structures [3] show growing interest in studying toroidal structures from the

materials research community.

Here we report for the ﬁrst time a rigorous ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain numerical anal-

ysis proving that a toroidal solenoid with poloidal wiring coaxial with an electric dipole is a

remarkable non-radiating conﬁguration. The property not to radiate electromagnetic energy

is based on the destructive interference between the ﬁelds created by each of its constituents.

We show that this conﬁguration may be used as a sensor for the dielectric permittivity of

the ambient matter. It becomes a directional radiator at an interface between two dielectric

media depositing energy in the material with highest polarizability.

Non-radiating conﬁgurations are such oscillating charge-current distributions that do not

produce electromagnetic ﬁelds in the radiation zone. An early work [4] shows that the orbital

motion of a uniformly charged spherical shell of radius R will not produce any radiation if the

radius R of the shell is equal to lcT /2 where c is the speed of light, T is the period of the orbit

and l is an integer number. The general problem for absence of radiation from an arbitrary

localized charge distribution, exhibiting periodic motion with period T = 2π/ω0, has been

addressed [5] and it has been shown that such a system does not generate electromagnetic

potentials in the radiation zone if the Fourier components

J (lω0r/cr, lω0) are not present in

the spectrum of the current density J (r, t). This criterion also explains the behavior of an

e

orbiting uniformly charged sphere. It has been pointed out in [5] that this condition may not

2

be necessary. It indeed ensures the disappearance of the electromagnetic potentials in the

radiation zone, however calculations of the power emitted by the system show that its value

is zero provided that

J(lω0r/cr, lω0)

r, which is a weaker suﬃcient condition. Indeed,

∝

the latter condition only requires the absence of the components transverse to the wave-

e

vector.

It has been proved rigorously [6] that the absence of the transverse components

of the Fourier spectrum of the current density is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for

absence of radiation. Interestingly, such a condition has appeared in an earlier study, [7],

in connection with electromagnetic self-force action and self-oscillations of a non-relativistic

particle.

The important conclusion that can be drawn from the earlier results is that two types of

non-radiating conﬁgurations can exist in principle. For the ﬁrst type the Fourier components

J(ωr/cr, ω) of the current density are zero. Numerous examples of systems pertaining to this

sort of non-radiating conﬁgurations exist - [4, 5, 8]. A characteristic feature of these systems
e

is that both the electromagnetic ﬁelds and the electromagnetic potentials are zero. For the

second type of non-radiating conﬁgurations the Fourier spectrum is purely longitudinal i.e.

J(ωr/cr, ω)

r. Here the electromagnetic ﬁelds are zero but as we show the electromagnetic

∝
potentials may be ﬁnite.
e

Interestingly, it is pointed out [5] that the case of

J(ωr/cr, ω)

r corresponds to triv-

∝

ial spherically symmetric radial oscillations of the charge density. Nevertheless non-trivial

e

examples can be created using toroidal structures. Recent papers [8] and [9] show that a non-

radiating conﬁguration can be constructed by combining an inﬁnitesimal toroidal solenoid

with poloidal current ﬂowing in its windings (i.e. along the meridians of the toroid) with an

electric dipole placed in the center of the toroid. The explicit calculations of [8] and [9] show

that while the electromagnetic ﬁelds disappear outside such a composite object, the electro-

magnetic potentials survive. As we show here this particular structure belongs to the second

type of non-radiating systems and that it is the longitudinal part of the Fourier-spectrum

of the current density which is responsible for the residual electromagnetic potentials in the

radiation zone.

The results of [8] and [9] suggest that the non-radiating conﬁgurations involving toroidal

solenoids may have a number of interesting electromagnetic properties. These properties

however have never been studied in proper detail. This is the aim of the present study.

The physical nature of the problem is extremely well-suited to numerical modelling using

the FDTD method [10] which will be used in our analysis. It gives the possibility to address

the electromagnetic properties of this speciﬁc structure consisting of a toroid coupled to a

dipole in full numerical detail. In addition, an assessment of what possible applications such

structures might have is given.

Exact compensation between the ﬁelds generated by a toroidal solenoid and an electrical

dipole takes place for inﬁnitesimal objects only. It therefore seems plausible that assessment

of the extent to which the properties of the inﬁnitesimal non-radiating conﬁgurations are

preserved by ﬁnite-dimensional counterparts should precede possible experimental designs.

It is important also to determine what is the behavior of these structures under certain

(non-trivial) perturbations.

INFINITESIMAL TOROIDAL SOLENOIDS AND NON-RADIATING CON-

The electromagnetic properties of toroidal solenoids and toroidal helix antennas are stud-

ied in detail in references [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Here only the results that will be used

in our exposition are brieﬂy summarized.

The current ﬂowing along the meridians of a toroidal solenoid (known also as poloidal

current, Fig. 1) can be presented in the form (see e.g. [15]):

jp =

M ,

∇ ×

since

.jp = 0. In Eq. (1) jp is the current density vector and M = (0, Mϕ, 0) is the

M =

if (ρ

d)2 + z2 < R2 and zero otherwise. In Eq. (2) N is the total number of windings and

−

I[A] is the magnitude of the current. Pursuing this idea a step further the magnetization

M can in turn be expressed as

where T = (0, 0, Tz) is called toroidization vector. The general problem is diﬃcult to perform

analytically [11, 12, 13, 14] and any limit that preserves the correct properties while at the

same time giving valuable mathematical simpliﬁcation is a step worth taking. Such a step

is d

0. This is a useful step because it gives the toroidization vector in the following form

(see e.g. [8, 15]).

Assuming monochromatic time-dependence,

A dipole can be introduced at the center of the toroid. If this dipole is modeled as a

piece of wire of length Ld with the current strength being equal to Id the dipole moment

amplitude, p0, can be expressed through iLdId = ωp0, where p0 = p0n. The magnetic ﬁeld

is the eﬀective relative dielectric permittivity of the medium in which electromagnetic ﬁelds

of the toroid and the electric dipole can compensate each other. This suggests that it

should be possible to measure the relative dielectric permittivities of media (e.g. liquids) by

adjusting experimentally the ratio of the currents Id and I until a minimum of the emitted

power is detected. Then the relative dielectric constant of the material under investigation

can be obtained from (9).

It has been pointed out in [9] that while the electromagnetic ﬁelds disappear when the

compensation condition (9) is satisﬁed the electromagnetic potentials survive. However,

there are examples of non-radiating conﬁgurations (see e.g. [5, 8]) for which both the elec-

tromagnetic ﬁelds and the electromagnetic potentials are zero. The question is then what

is the physical reason for that and what is the diﬀerence between both types of electromag-

netic systems. Following [5, 6] it can be shown that the diﬀerence is in the current-density

spectra. To see this consider the vector potential

to deriving Eq. (13) but this time for the scalar potential it can be shown that the scalar

e

potential is also zero if (14) is satisﬁed. Therefore (14) ensures that the electromagnetic

system considered is a non-radiating conﬁguration. This general statement is a suﬃcient

condition [5].

The results of [6] imply however that the condition (14) is not necessary. With the

III. NUMERICAL MODELING OF THE INTERACTION OF A NON-

RADIATING CONFIGURATION WITH THE INTERFACE BETWEEN TWO MA-

TERIALS

As can be seen from Section 2 the composite emitter - toroid and dipole - becomes a

non-radiating conﬁguration (note that the compensation condition (9) is satisﬁed) due to

the destructive interference between the electromagnetic ﬁelds created by the toroid and

by the electric dipole. This interference occurs in all possible directions in a homogeneous

medium. In an inhomogeneous material however as would be encountered for an interface

between two dielectrics with relative permittivity constants ǫ1, and ǫ2 this does not happen.

To appreciate this consider the situation shown in Figure 2, in which an emitter consisting of

an electric dipole and a toroidal solenoid is placed in a medium with dielectric permittivity

FIG. 2: Non-radiating conﬁguration consisting of a toroidal solenoid and an electric dipole near

layer; d - dipole, T - toroid; Σ1, Σ2 - cylindrical surfaces used to calculate the power emitted in

each of the materials with ǫ = ǫ1 and ǫ = ǫ2, respectively.

equal to ǫ1. This medium is separated from a second one by a planar interface located

at a distance D from the equatorial plane of the toroid.

In the absence of the interface

the system is non-radiative and the eﬀective permittivity is

ǫ = ǫ1. In order to assess the

consequences ﬂowing from the presence of the interface between the two dielectrics and also

e

the ﬁnite size of both the toroid and the dipole it is necessary to solve the Maxwell’s equation

exactly. This can be achieved numerically using the FDTD method [10]. The latter can be

considerably simpliﬁed since the toroid is a body of revolution (BOR). Taking advantage of

the axial symmetry reduces the problem to a two-dimensional one. Cylindrical coordinates

can be used and there is no dependence on the azimuthal variable angle ϕ (Fig. 2). This

implementation of the FDTD method is known as BOR-FDTD [10]. The computational

domain is terminated by a standard perfectly matched layer (PML) [10, 19]. The radiation

of both the toroid and the dipole is categorized by the ﬁeld components (Eρ, Ez, Hϕ) that

are not identically zero and hence it is of E-type (TM) [15]. The applicability of the FDTD

method to radiating structures (antenna problems) is well established and this technique

9

has been successfully applied to various designs [20, 21, 22].

In the model the poloidal

current jp, is expressed through the azimuthal component of the magnetization which is

consistent with the assumption that all the parts of the toroid respond simultaneously (or

with negligible delay) to the driving voltage. This is expected to occur when the size of the

toroid is much smaller than the wavelength. To evaluate the directional properties of the

emitting structure studied, the quantities P1 and P2 are introduced and deﬁned as

surfaces placed away from the source (close to the PML region) in order to ensure that the

near-ﬁeld contributions have negligible eﬀect on the power values calculated according to

(22).

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In order to model the behavior of the non-radiating conﬁguration the following parameter

values are selected. The larger and the smaller radii of the toroidal solenoid are ﬁxed to

d = 1 cm and R = 0.5 cm, respectively, the dipole length is Ld=0.9 cm and the excitation

frequency is ω/2π = 1 GHz. The FDTD-grid resolution is ∆ρ = ∆z = λ/300, where λ is

the free-space wavelength. Since Eq. (8) is strictly valid for inﬁnitesimal objects only, it is

necessary to make sure that for the selected values of the parameters the contributions from

the higher-order multipoles are negligible. To verify this Eq. (8) has been compared with

results obtained from FDTD simulations in a homogeneous material (this pertains to the

case of ǫ1 = ǫ2 = ǫ in Fig. 2) and the result is presented in Figure 3. The simulations are in

good agreement with Eq. (8). This means that for the selected values of the parameters the

contributions of the toroidal dipole moment and the electrical dipole moment are dominant.

Figure 4 compares the directional properties of a perturbed non-radiating conﬁguration

with that of an electric dipole. The ratio between the power values P1 and P2 emitted

in the materials with dielectric constants ǫ1 and ǫ2, is computed for several values of the

distance D using either a non-radiating conﬁguration or an electric dipole. The presence of

the interface aﬀects both types of emitters. However Fig. 4 shows that a larger fraction of

the total emitted power can be directed in the material with ǫ = ǫ2 for the case in which the

and the solid squares are the analytical result (Eq. (8)) and the numerical result, respectively.

interface. The parameter

emitter is a non-radiating conﬁguration. Comparing the performance of the non-radiating

e

e

conﬁguration with that of the dipole acting along shows that the non-radiating conﬁgurations

has a clear advantage in the ability to direct a larger fraction of the total emitted power in

a material with higher value of the dielectric constant. This advantage disappears in the

proportion of the increase of the distance to the interface.

It has been veriﬁed that the

dependence of the ratio P2/P1 on the distance D for both the emitters stems mainly from

11

the dependence of the quantity P2 on D. The value of P1 appears to be less susceptible to

the variations of D for this range of parameter values. For some applications it might be

desirable to direct electromagnetic energy within a certain material while little or no energy

is emitted to the surrounding space. It seems that a non-radiating conﬁguration with

ǫ = ǫ1

may be suitable for this purpose. Relatively far from the interface it does not radiate at all,

e

or radiates a small amount of power. Bringing the non-radiating conﬁguration into contact

with the interface will lead to an increase of the total emitted power P1 + P2, (keeping the

values of the currents Id and I ﬁxed) with the contribution P2 predominating strongly.

To study this property further Figure 5 and Figure 6 show the dependence of the ratio

P2/P1 on the dielectric constant of the substrate for two ﬁxed values of the distance D

between the emitters and the interface and

ǫ = ǫ1. The directional properties of the non-

radiating composite object are compared with those of its constituents - the electrical dipole
e
and the toroidal solenoid. As Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show, the ratio P2/P1 for the toroidal solenoid

and for the electrical dipole shows little dependence on the dielectric constant of the substrate

ǫ2. At same time, when non-radiating conﬁguration is used as an emitter, not only the ratio

P2/P1 is higher, but it increases strongly with the increase of ǫ2. This shows that in the region

of parameter values studied the directional properties of the non-radiating conﬁguration

improve with the increase of the contrast between the relative dielectric permittivities of the

two materials. A comparison between Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 shows that as the non-radiating

conﬁguration approaches the interface its performance improves. Indeed, it can be concluded

that the optimum performance is achieved when the non-radiating conﬁguration is in direct

contact with the interface. This feature is in agreement with Figure 4. The dependence of

the emission properties of the non-radiating conﬁguration upon the values of the dielectric

constant of the substrate is suitable for sensor applications.

The results presented in Fig. 6 are visually presented in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 where the

spatial distribution of the time-averaged Poynting vector around two of the studied emitters

- non-radiating conﬁguration and a toroidal solenoid - is shown. The Poynting vector values

are normalized to the value of the total emitted power to allow a comparison at identical

total emitted powers to be made. As can be seen the electromagnetic ﬁeld created by the

non-radiating conﬁguration in free space (ǫ = 1) is weak compared to that emitted by the

toroidal solenoid. This shows that a larger fraction of the total emitted power is deposited

in the substrate material.

constant ǫ2. The parameter

ǫ of the non-radiating conﬁguration is

V. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion we studied a remarkable non-radiating conﬁguration consisting of a toroidal

solenoid coupled to an electrical dipole. The property not to radiate electromagnetic energy

is based on the destructive interference between the ﬁelds created by each of its constituents.

We show that the interference eﬀect depends on the dielectric characteristics of the ambient

matter and the conﬁguration may be used in dielectric permittivity measurements. It be-

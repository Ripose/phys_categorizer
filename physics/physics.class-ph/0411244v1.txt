Rotational satiability of ﬂoating bodies

Mohammad Abolhassani∗
(Dated: February 20, 2014)

The potential energy of a system in stable equilibrium has a minimum value. This property is
used to derive a formula that is useful in determination of stability of a ﬂoating body. Analysis
shows that a ﬂoating body is in stable equilibrium if its center of mass has a minimum height with
respect to its related center of buoyancy.

INTRODUCTION

II. THEORETICAL APPROACH

Study of stability of ﬂoating bodies is a conventional
subject in ﬂuid mechanics. Two forces act on a ﬂoating
body; weight, that acts on the center of mass (CM), and
buoyancy force that acts on the center of buoyancy (CB)
(the centroid of the displaced volume of ﬂuid). The equi-
librium of a body requires that these two forces must be
equal and the joint line of these two points has to be in
vertical direction too.

Stability of a ﬂoating body is divided in two diﬀerent
types, vertical and rotational. A ﬂoating body has verti-
cal stability but its rotational stability depends upon the
positions of its CM and the CB. The equilibrium is stable
if the position of the CM is below the position of the CB.
But if the position of the CM is above the position of the
CB the equilibrium may or may not be stable.

The usual method in study of stability of a ﬂoating
body is ﬁnding the metacenter point and then comparing
of its position with the position of CM of the body. The
equilibrium is stable if the metacenter lies above the CM
[1, 2].

In this paper, stability of ﬂoating bodies is studied
by another method. We know that a system is in stable
equilibrium when its potential energy is a minimum. This
system has such a conﬁguration that with a little change
in its conﬁguration, the potential energy of the system
increases.

Consider a system consisting of a ﬂuid and a ﬂoating
body. If the ﬂoating body is in stable equilibrium, the
gravitational potential energy (GPE) of the system must
be minimum. Therefore, when the body is tilted, the CM
of the ﬂuid and the CM of the body will change; then the
CM of the system rises and consequently the GPE of the
system increases.

As a result, if by tilting the body, the GPE of the

system increases, the body is in stable equilibrium.

Let us consider a body of mass m and a ﬂuid of mass
M , as shown in Figure 1, so that the body has vertical
stability. The GPE of the system (body + ﬂuid) is given
by

U =

(m + M )~g. ~Rm+M ,

FIG. 1: A ﬂoating body of mass m is partially immersed in a
ﬂuid of mass M . The body has vertical stability. Rm, RM ,
and Rm+M are the positions vectors of the CM of the body,
ﬂuid, and system respectively.

where ~g is acceleration of gravity and ~Rm+M is the

position vector of the CM of the system.

The ~Rm+M can be written in term of the position vec-
tor of the CM of the body, ~Rm, and the position vector
of the CM of the ﬂuid, ~RM [3]:

(m + M ) ~Rm+M = m ~Rm + M ~RM .

Thus

U =

(m~g. ~Rm + M~g. ~RM ).

U = mgym + M gyM ,

where ym and yM are y coordinates of the centers of

mass of the body and ﬂuid respectively.

When the body is partially immersed in the ﬂuid, some
part of the ﬂuid is displaced by the body. We name mass
of the displaced ﬂuid by M ′ and the y coordinate of its
CM, which is buoyancy center, by yM ′. Figure 2 shows a
hole in the ﬂuid formerly occupied by the immersed part
of the body. If this hole to be ﬁlled by the same type of
ﬂuid, so the mass of resulted ﬂuid is ”M + M ′” and its
CM is yM+M ′ . But, according to the statement quoted

Figure 3a shows a long uniform bar of relative density

with two opposite surfaces parallel to the water. In this

FIG. 2: The body of ﬁgure 1 is removed and the appeared
hole is ﬁlled by the same ﬂuid. M ′

ﬂuid; RM
′ are the positions vectors of the CM
of the added and resulted ﬂuid respectively.

(M + M ′)yM+M ′ = M yM + M ′yM ′ .
By eliminating yM between Eqs. (4) and (5), we have

(5)

U = [mym + (M + M ′)yM+M ′ −

M ′yM ′ ]g.

(6)

In vertical equilibrium the mass of the displaced ﬂuid,
M ′, is equal to the mass of the body, m, independent of
orientation of the body. Therefore M ′ and also yM+M ′
are constants. Thus Eq. (6) is reduced to

The ﬁrst term on the right side of Eq. (7) is a constant.
Therefore GPE of the system is a function of ∆y = ym
yM ′ .

In case of ∆y is an extremum, the body is in equilib-
rium. When ∆y is minimum (maximum), U is minimum
(maximum) and therefore body is in stable (unstable)
equilibrium.

When the equilibrium positions of a ﬂoating body is
marked in two cases, we can deduce types of equilibri-
ums by comparing two ”∆y”s in those two cases; smaller
(greater) ∆y shows stable (unstable) equilibrium.

FIG. 4: The graphs of ∆y versus ρ for two positions of the
ﬂoating bar in ﬁgure 3; the broken curve corresponds to (a),
and the full curve corresponds to (b) [see Eqs. (8) and (9)].

Another equilibrium position is with all four surfaces
at 45◦ with the water, as shown in ﬁgure 3b. In this case
we have

The graphs of two functions ∆y1 and ∆y2 as a function
of ρ are plotted in ﬁgure 4. Two curves cross each other

in points ρ1 ∼= 0.2429, ρ2 ∼= 0.7572 and ρ3 = 1. For
ρ1 < ρ < ρ2, where ∆y1 > ∆y2, the bar is in stable
equilibrium, when it ﬂoats as shown in ﬁgure 3b. The

equilibrium is neutral, where is equal to ρ1, ρ2 or 1. For
other values of ρ, equilibrium is stable if the bar ﬂoats as
in ﬁgure 3a.

Comment to the paper ” The energy conservation law
for electromagnetic ﬁeld in application to problems
of radiation of moving particles ”

E.G.Bessonov

In the paper [1] the energy conservation law (the Poynting theorem) was applied to a
problem of radiation of a charged particle in an external electromagnetic ﬁeld. The authors
consecutively and mathematically strictly solved the problem but received wrong result.
They derived an expression which includes a change of the energies of the electromagnetic
ﬁelds accompanying the homogeneously moving particle ∆W = W2
W1 corresponding
to the initial and ﬁnal velocity of the particle (see expression (19) in [1]). The energy of
the ﬁeld accompanying the particle W is the energy of the particle of the electromagnetic
origin.
It should not enter the solution of the problem. The authors do not specify
the dimensions of the particle. For pointlike particle this energy and the change ∆W
are inﬁnite values and consequently the expression (19) loses sense. In quantum theory
the derived expression require some renormalization. In classical theory in the section
devoted to the energy conservation law the energy of the accompanying ﬁeld that is the
energy of the particle of the electromagnetic origin is hidden in the total energy of the
electromagnetic origin and hence it is appeared unnoticed. For this reason the solutions
based on the use of the energy conservation law lead to the wrong results when ∆W
= 0
[2]. The received solutions diﬀer from the solutions based on the equations of motion of
particles in the external ﬁelds.

We will explain our observation using the second example considered by the authors.
This example was formulated as follows. Let a charged particle is moving in a positive
direction of the axis ”z” with a velocity ~v1.
In some area with the linear dimensions
L located near to the origin of the reference frame the external electromagnetic ﬁelds
are created where the velocity of the particle is varied under some law which is not
speciﬁed. Then the particle go out from this area and it’s velocity accepts the value ~v2
which hereinafter is not changed. The authors proceed from the expression for the energy
conservation law of the form

sign V under the integral means that the integral is carried out through a chosen volume
V and the sign S means that the integral is carried out through a surface S limiting this
volume. This law (the Poynting theorem) follows from the Maxwell’s equations.

and ~E2, ~H2 are the vectors of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths created by a
particle moving homogeneously with velocities ~v1, ~v2 accordingly. It is supposed that the
boundary of the volume V is chosen so far that the wavepacket of radiation was in time
to be separated from the ﬁeld of the charged particle so that free ﬁelds of radiation and
the ﬁeld accompanying the particle are not overlapped.

Further the authors go to the conclusion that the ﬂow of radiation from the volume
V according to (2) is determined not only by the work of forces acting on the charged
particles by ﬁelds (integral from ~ ~E) but also by change of the energy of the accompanying
electromagnetic ﬁeld ∆W .

Now we notice that the vector of the electric ﬁeld strength in the region of location of
the particle can be presented in the form ~E = ~Eext + ~Es, where ~Eext is the vector of the
external electric ﬁeld strength created by charged bodies and other particles, ~Es vector
of the electric ﬁeld strength produced by the particle under consideration. Therefore the
external ﬁelds and the ﬁelds produced by a particle (inertial and radiating self-ﬁelds) were

energy of these ﬁelds is constant.

In the presented example it was supposed that the external ﬁelds are static and the
In a static case the electric ﬁeld is potential one
~Eext(~r)d~r = 0. The external ﬁeld could be the magnetic one. Therefore obviously

the change of the energy of the particle in the case of static ﬁelds should be equal to the

The expression (4) follows also from the equations of motion of the particle in the
external ﬁelds taking into account the radiation reaction force and the laws of radiation
of a particle in the external ﬁelds which are determine the rate of losses of the energy of
the particle in the form of radiation.

Contrary to expected result a superﬂuous term has appeared in the expression (3)
which is equal to the change of the energy of the ﬁeld ∆W accompanying the particle
and diﬀer from zero as the initial v1 =
velocities are not equal
(v1

and ﬁnal v2 =

= 0).

The presence of the superﬂuous term ∆W is in accordance with the conclusions made
in the paper [2] that from the equations of Maxwell-Lorentz does not follow the correct
energy conservation law that is the law which describe the nature correct way since the
equations of Maxwell and equations of Lorentz are inconsistent. The expression (1) con-
tains a logic error consisting in the fact that in the ﬁrst ﬁeld term of this expression the
energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is included and in this energy the energy of the accepted
electromagnetic ﬁeld of the particle i.e. the energy of the particle of electromagnetic ori-
gins is hidden. It means that the energy of the particle of the electromagnetic origin in
the equation (1) is presented in two terms (left and ﬁrst right term). Accordingly the
energy of the particle of the electromagnetic origin in the equation (3) is also presented in
two terms (∆ε and ∆W ). We should like to remind that energy of the particle is a sum of
energies of the electromagnetic and non-electromagnetic origin and in the case of pointlike
particles they are inﬁnite and have opposite sign and their sum presents the experimen-
tally observable value ε [3]. Thus the energy of particles of the electromagnetic origin is
presented in expressions (1), (3) twice and that is why the Poynting theorem generalized
on a case of a system of ﬁelds and particles becomes incorrect. In the case of pointlike
particles the value ∆W in the expression (3) is inﬁnite when the value v1
= 0 and
that is why this expression loses its sense. The logic error consist in the double inclusion
of the energy of the particle of the electromagnetic origin in the same equation.

We would like to remind the energy conservation law for a system of the electromag-

netic ﬁeld and particles in an integral form ∂εΣ/∂t = 0 or εΣ = const where

εi is the energy of a particle i, and the integration is carried out through the whole space
[3]. The ﬁrst term from the right in the expression (5) contains both the free ﬁeld of
radiation emitted by charged particles and the ﬁeld accompanying these particles. The
dimensions, charge, and weight of the particle and also their structure can be arbitrary.
That is why massive charged bodies and magnets can enter in (5). Massive bodies can
have complex structure. In this case the exchange of the energy of electromagnetic ﬁelds
is possible in internal degrees of freedom of a body (for example, in heating the body).
At that the weight and, accordingly, energy of bodies εi will be increased.

(5)

In a general case if the wave packet of radiation emitted by a system of particles will
be in time to be separated from the ﬁelds accompanying these particles then the change
of the energy of the system of particles ∆ε = Σ∆εi and the change of the energy of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld according to (5) will be determined by the same expression (3) where
now ∆W is the change of the energy of the accompanying electromagnetic ﬁelds of all
particles1. It means that the conclusion about a logic mistake made at the proof of the
energy conservation law for a system of electromagnetic ﬁeld and particles made in the
paper [2] for a general case non-obviously was conﬁrmed by the authors of the commented
paper in their example.

1Certainly it is possible to receive this conclusion proceeding from the expression (1).

At the derivation of the energy conservation law for the system of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld and particles a mistake was made which further was accepted by repetition in many
papers and textbooks. Therefore the interpretation of this law in the textbooks should be
changed and should be treated in the form of an open question in classical electrodynamics.

present comment.

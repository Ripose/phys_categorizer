Abstract. Cmpact general
formulae for the energy, momentum and angular
momentum radiated by conﬁned systems of charges and currents are presented in
terms of their multipole Cartesian tensors. Besides the usual electric and magnetic
multipoles, a family of toroid (anapole) electromagnetic tensors, as well as some mean
squared radii contributions are standed out through a method given in previous works
of the authors.

1. Introduction

The purpose of the present paper is to obtain general formulae for the energy, momentum
and angular momentum loss in the case of a bounded charge and current distribution,
in the form of multipolar expansions, using only fully symmetric and trace-free (STF)
electric , magnetic and anapole (toroidal) multipole tensors, together with some mean
squared radii. The gauge invariant technique of reducing the usual Cartesian electric
and magnetic multipole moments to STF ones , presented in [2] , is used for this end.
In the section 2 the multipolar expansions of the scalar and vector potentials, Φ and
A, are presented in terms of electric and magnetic Cartesian multipole moments. In
section 3 the coresponding expansions of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, E and B, are
given. The relevant terms for the purposes of this paper are only those that fall oﬀ as
fast as 1/r and 1/r2 as r → ∞ given in equations (11) and (12). In section 4 the total
radiation intensity (energy loss ) is calculated and given by equation (19) in the form of
an expansion in terms of STF multipole moments . The same calculation is performed
in section 5 and 6 respectively for the total momentum loss and angular momentum loss.
In section 7, the approximation’s criteria are discussed and, ﬁnally, one presents explicit
expressions for the radiated energy, momentum and angular momentum including all
the electric and magnetic multipoles up to order three (octopoles). These results are
compared with some incomplete expressions existing in literature.

In appendix A one can ﬁnd the deﬁnition formulae for the reduced electric and

magnetic multipole moments .

2. General Formulae

We shall accept in the following a compromise regarding the unit systems used for writing
Maxwell’s equations and the diﬀerent deﬁnitions and equations for electromagnetic
theory. Let the Maxwell’s equations be written as

µ0
α

∇ × B =

ε0µ0
α
∇B = 0, ∇ · E =

j +

∂E
∂t

1
ε0

ρ

, ∇ × E = −

1
α

∂B
∂t

where the positive parameters ε0, µ0, α are constants depending on the system of
units. Considering the consequences of Maxwell equations, from physical reasons, only
two independent constants will be needed because of the constraint

α2
ε0µ0

= c2

c standing for the speed of light in vacuum.

If the Maxwell equations are written in the form above, than the ﬁelds E, B and

the potentials Φ, A are related by the equations
∂A
∂t

B = ∇ × A, E = −∇Φ −

1
α

while the retarded potentials are given by

A(r, t) =

µ0
4πα ZD

j(ξ, t − R/c)
R

dξ3, Φ(r, t) =

dξ3, R = |r − ξ|.

1
4πε0 ZD

ρ(ξ, t − R/c)
R

One can write the equations and formulae above in the International unit system
by taking α = 1 and the IS values for ε0, µ0. The same relations can be written in
Heaviside-Lorentz unit system by taking ε0 = 1, µ0 = 1, α = c in cgs units while in
Gauss unit system ε0 = 1/4π, µ0 = 4π, α = c .

The goal of this compromise is to compare easily the results from the present paper
with similar results in diﬀerent issues written either in IS or in Gauss or Heaviside-
Lorentz units.

Let us consider a charge ρ(r, t) and a current j(r, t) distributions having supports
included in a ﬁnite domain D. Choosing the origin O of the Cartesian axes in D, the
retarded vector and scalar potentials at a point outside D, r = xiei, will be given by
the multipolar expansions

In equation (9) and in the following we understand by A{i1...in} the sum over all the
permutations of the symbols iq that give distinct terms. The use of the formula (9) in
equations (7) and (8), and also of the well known properties of STF tensors, allows the
ordering of the contributions in the expansions above as a 1/r power series.

Let us write E = E(1)+E(2)+O(1/r3) where E(1) and E(2) are respectively, proportional
with 1/r and 1/r2 and, similarly, B = B(1) + B(2) + O(1/r3). The parts E(1) and B(1)
of the ﬁeld are purely transverse ﬁelds, satisfying the properties

6. Angular Momentum Loss

f

e

The total angular momentum lost per unit time by a radiating system is given by the
ﬂux of the radiated electromagnetic angular momentum through the spherical surface of
radius r → ∞. The 2nd-order antisymmetric tensor associated with the electromagnetic
angular momentum density is deﬁned by its Cartesian components mij = xigj − xjgi
where the electromagnetic momentum density vector is g = (ε0/α)(E × B). The
angular momentum density current is associated with the 3rd-order tensor µ(3); µkij =
xiTjk − xjTik with Tjk given by equation (20). By introducing the angular momentum
density pseudovector L with the components Li = (1/2)εijkmjk, and the 2nd-order
kl = (1/2)εlijµ(3)
angular momentum current tensor µ(2)
kij, we obtain that

7. Discussion and conclusions

The procedure, given in the present paper, for calculating the energy, momentum and
angular momentum radiated by arbitrary sources is characterized by the mathematical
simplicity.
In our calculations only simple algebraic manipulation is necessary. The
results expressed in diﬀerent coordinate systems, for example spherical, may be obtained
by adequate transformations. Complete and correct multipole analysis is given in
some fundamental works as [6, 7]. In these works, the multipole expansion formulae
are introduced using the canonical basis of the solutions of the scalar wave equation
of Helmholtz. Although the results obtained by this formalism represent an exact
description of the multipolar expansion applied to the electromagnetic ﬁeld of arbitrary
sources, the formulae are rather cumbersome. Due to the complexity of these formulae,
the possibility to obtain erroneous results exists even in the case one calculates the
contributions of the low order multipoles to the radiated ﬁeld. This is the reason why
we believe it is necessary to give corrections for the radiation formulae obtained in [6, 7]
in addition to the corrections given in these papers to the results from [8, 9].

By applying the formulae for the radiated quantities, some care is necessary for
obtaining a correct grouping of the diﬀerent multipolar terms in a given approximation.
For understanding this problem it is suﬃcient to refer to the harmonic time variation
of the charges and currents. Let us consider

ρ(r, t) = ρ0(r)e−iωt, j(r, t) = j0(r)e−iωt.

By considering the magnetic multipole tensor M(t), the n-order time derivative may be
written as

dn
dtn

M(n) =

(−iω)n n
(n + 1)α ZD

ξn × j 0(ξ)d3ξ ∼ ωndn

where d is the linear dimension of the domain D. By introducing the wave length of the
emited radiation, λ = 2πc/ω, we may write

(36)

(37)

dtn

M(n) ∼

n

.

d

The parameters ω and d are related, as order of magnitude, to the charges velocities,
ωd ∼ v, such that ωd/c ∼ v/c. In what concerns the electric multipole’s contributions,
we notice that the contribution of the time derivative of the n-order electric multipole

Multipolar radiation and the gauge invariant reduction of multipole tensors

is of the same order of magnitude as the contribution of the (n − 1)th order magnetic
multipole because

Consequently, as is pointed out also in [5], in the case of the radiation intensity, in
equations (19), (24) and (35), a consistent expansion should take into account, alongside
with the magnetic multipoles up to a given order µ, the electric multipoles up to the
order ε = µ + 1.

For a comparison with some results from the literature, for example [6, 7], we
give below the results of the expansions of the total radiated power, recoil force and
angular momentum for (µ, ε) = (4, 5) pointing out the criteria for grouping the diﬀerent
multipolar terms for a given approximation.

In order to understand this problem, we give for the case of the radiated power a
detailed description of the procedure used. We denote by I (µ,ε) the radiated power
obtained by the recursive procedure begining from the order µ for the magnetic
multipoles and from the order ε for the electric ones.
In the case of the harmonic
time variation, we stand out only the parameters d, c and ω. In the case (µ, ε) = (4, 5),
considering the c dependence of the coeﬃcients given by equations (A.20), and using
equations (A.22)-(A.26), we can write

where aij and a′
ij are functions of time proportional with sin ωt or cos ωt, and the

magnitude order of a common factor is not considered. We point out that in equations
(38) a contribution to the absolute order of magnitude of the ﬁnal results gives the
current density j ∼ v ∼ ωd. This factor present in all the expressions from equations
(38), associated with 1/c factors from equations (19), (24) and (35), gives a factor
(d/λ)2 ∼ (v/c)2 in the expressions of the corresponding expansions. This common factor
is irrelevant four our considerations.
If we consider equations (38) in the multipolar
expansion (19), we can write in the case (µ, ε) = (4, 5) the following result for the
relative orders of magnitude of the diﬀerent terms

I (4,5) ∼ A0 + A2ζ 2 + A4ζ 4 + A6ζ 6 + A8ζ 8,

ζ = d/λ.

(39)

From equations (A.15) and (A.16), one can see that I (5,6) can be written in the form
of a similar expansion in which A0, A2, and A4 are unchanged, and only A6, A8,...will
be diﬀerent. Consequently, for a consistent approximation of I using the multipole

Multipolar radiation and the gauge invariant reduction of multipole tensors

10

expansions up to (µ, ε) = (4, 5) one should keep only the terms of the order (d/λ)n for
n < 4.

Similar considerations may be applied for the evaluation of the recoil force and
radiated angular momentum. From the results given in [6] and [7], it seems that the
authors claim to give the ﬁrst 3 terms of the d/λ expansion of the radiated power,
the ﬁrst two terms of the expansion of the recoil force and again the ﬁrst 3 terms of
the expansion of the angular momentum loss. Our evaluations give for these cases,
very diﬀerent results. It seems that, in the above mentioned papers, the approximation
criteria are not applied consistently. The comprising of the factor 1/c in the deﬁnitions
of diﬀerent parameters as, for example, for the toroid dipole, seems to be one of the
sources of errors. We point out the beneﬁt of using a system-free expression of Maxwell’s
equations, as in the present paper. So, the factors c included in diﬀerent deﬁnitions in
Gauss system of units is represented here by α which is no counting to the evaluation
of approximation order. This fact was observed also in [5] in the case of the energy loss.

We give bellow our results for the above mentioned approximations.
In the case of the radiated power, it is necessary to calculate I (4,5) and retain only

the powers of ζ up to four. One obtains

Appendix A. Gauge invariant reduction of multipole Cartesian tensors

The transformations (6) involve a sequence of operations meant to obtain the symmetric
and traceless part of the tensors implied. Let an n-rank tensor L(n) of magnetic type
i.e. symmetric in the ﬁrst n − 1 indices and verifying the property Li1...ik−1 j ik+1...in−1 j =
0, k = 1 . . . n − 1. The the symmetric part of this tensor is given by

and go downward up to lowest value, n = 1. Generally, we may choose ε > µ as will be
seen in the following. In [3] are given the formulae for the results

involved [6, 7].

For applications, we we give the results of the gauge invariant reduction of the
electric and magnetic multipole tensors, begining the reduction procedure from the rank
ε = 5 for the electric tensors, and from µ = 4 for the magnetic ones. From equation

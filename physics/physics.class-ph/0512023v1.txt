TIME REVERSAL COMMUNICATION IN RAYLEIGH-FADING
BROADCAST CHANNELS WITH PINHOLES

ALBERT C. FANNJIANG

Abstract. The paper presents an analysis of the time reversal in independent-
multi-path Rayleigh-fading channels with N inputs (transmitters) and M out-
puts (receivers). The main issues addressed are the condition of statistical
stability, the rate of information transfer and the eﬀect of pinholes. The sta-
bility condition is proved to be M C ≪ Neﬀ B for broadband channels and
M ≪ Neﬀ for narrowband channels where C is the symbol rate, B is the
bandwidth and Neﬀ is the eﬀective number (maybe less than 1) of transmit-
It is shown that when the number of screens, n − 1, is relatively low
ters.
compared to the logarithm of numbers of pinholes Neﬀ is given by the har-
monic (or inverse) sum of the number of transmitters and the numbers of
pinholes at all screens. The novel idea of the eﬀective number of time rever-
sal array (TRA) elements is introduced to derive the stability condition and
estimate the channel capacity in the presence of multi-screen pinholes. The
information rate, under the constraints of the noise ν and the average total
power P , attains the supremum P/ν in the regime M ∧ Neﬀ ≫ P/(νB). In
particular, when Neﬀ ≫ M ≫ P/(Bν) the optimal information rate can be
achieved with statistically stable, sharply focused signals.

1. Introduction

Time reversal (TR) of waves has received great attention in recent years and been
extensively studied for electromagnetic [2], [20], [32] as well as acoustic propagation
(see [14] and the references therein). A striking eﬀect of time reversal in randomly
inhomogeneous media is the superresolution of refocal signals [1], [13] which implies
low probability of intercept and holds high potential in technological applications
such as communications [9], [25], [10], [17],[18].

An issue prior to superresolution, however, is statistical stability, namely the
question: How many antennas and how much bandwidth does one need to achieve
self-averaging in TR so that the received signals are nearly deterministic, indepen-
dent of the channel statistics? In this paper we answer this question for independent-
multi-path Rayleigh fading channels, with multiple inputs and multiple outputs
(MIMO), commonly used in wireless communication literature, see, e.g. [23]. We
also introduce the novel idea of eﬀective number of transmitters to analyze the
eﬀect of multi-screen pinholes on stability and capacity.

In the MIMO-TR communication scheme [9], [12], the M well-separated receivers
ﬁrst send a pilot signal to the N -element time reversal array (TRA) which then
uses the time-reversed version of the received signals to modulate the data symbols

is that the time reversal process is statistically stable when

M C ≪ NeﬀB,
M ≪ Neﬀ ,

for broadband channels
for narrowband channels

where C(≤ 2B) is the symbol rate, B is the bandwidth and Neﬀ is the eﬀective
number of transmitters (maybe less than one). In the presence of (n − 1)-screen
pinholes, we show that the eﬀective number of transmitters is asymptotically the
harmonic sum of the number of transmitters and the number of pinholes of every
screen when all these numbers are greater than 2n.

The LHS of (1) is the number of degrees of freedom per unit time in the constel-
lation of input data-streams while the RHS of (1) is roughly the number of degrees
of freedom per unit time in the channel state information (CSI) received by TRA
from the pilot signals. The latter has to be larger than the former in order to
reverse the random scrambling by the channel and achieve deterministic outputs.
The stability condition N ≫ 1 for narrow-band channels or B ≫ βc (the coherence
bandwidth) for broadband channels, when M is small and the pinholes are absent,
have been previously discussed in [1], [7], [8], [9], [20].

In Section 4 and 5.2, we analyze the information rate of the TR broadcast channel
in the presence of noise. We show that the optimal information rate R ∼ P/ν, under
the power and noise constraints, can be achieved in the regime M ∧ Neﬀ ≫ P/(νB)
where ν is the magnitude of noise per unit frequency and P the average total power
input. In particular, when Neﬀ ≫ M ≫ P/(Bν) the optimal information rate can
be achieved with statistically stable, sharply focused signals.

2. TR-MIMO communication

First let us review the MIMO-TR communication scheme as described in [12]

which is an example of broadcast channel [23].

The M receivers located at yj , j = 1, ..., M ﬁrst send a pilot signal

eiωtg(B−1(ω−
ω0))dωδ(x − yj) to the N -element TRA located at xi, i = 1, ..., N which then uses
eiωtg(B−1(ω − ω0))H(yj , xi; ω)dω
the time-reversed version of the received signal
to encode a stream of symbols and retransmit them back to the receivers. Here H is
the transfer function of the propagation channel at the frequency ω from point y to
x and g2(ω) is the power density at ω. Let H(ω) = [Hij (ω)], Hij(ω) = H(xi, yj; ω),

R

be the transfer matrix between the transmitters and receivers. The reciprocity im-
plies that H(yj , xi; ω) = Hij (ω) and H∗(ω) = H(−ω) where ∗ stands for complex
conjugation. Let us assume that g is a smooth and rapidly decaying function such
as the Gaussian function. Naturally the relative bandwidth B/ω0 is less than unity
so that ω0 ≫ 1 if B ≫ 1. In this paper we will assume B/ω0 ≪ 1 to simplify
the frequency coherence structure below (Section 3). We have chosen the time unit
such that the speed of propagation is one and the wavenumber equals the frequency.
The signal vector S = (Sj) arriving at the receivers with delay L + t is then given

by [12] (see also [1], [6])

not coordinate in decoding the total signal vector received. As a consequence, the
multi-user interference arises and can be a serious impedance to communications.

3. Statistical stability

Hij(ω)

One of the main goals of the present note is to characterize the stability regime for
the independent-multi-path Rayleigh fading channel in which Hij (ω) are indepen-
dent CN (0, σ), the zero-mean, variance-σ circularly symmetric complex-Gaussian
i,j,ω are a jointly Gaussian process. The independent-
random variables and
multi-path Rayleigh fading is an idealized model for richly scattering environment,
after proper normalization, when the spacings within the transmitters and receivers
are larger than the coherence length ℓc of the channel. In general, the coherence
length is inversely proportional to the angular spread [23] and sometimes can be
computed explicitly in terms of physical properties of the channel [12]. For diﬀuse
waves the coherence length is known to be on the scale of wavelength [28], [27].

(cid:9)

(cid:8)

We set the variance σ = 1/(N ∨ M ) so that the average input power is no less
than the average output power. The value of σ would not change the conditions of
statistical stability but will aﬀect the discussion of information transfer in the next
section.

Let us calculate the mean and the variance of the signals with respect to the
ensemble of the channel. Let E denote the channel ensemble average. For simplicity,
we assume that |mi(τl)| = µ,∀i, l. By the Gaussian rule for the calculation of

moments we have

where f (ω0, ·) is a continuous, rapidly decaying function and f (ω0, 0) = 1 (see [11],
[12] for a rigorous example). Here we have used the fact that the relative bandwidth
B/ω0 is small so that f is independent of the precise value of the frequency. Below
we shall suppress the argument ω0 in f . The coherence bandwidth βc is inversely
proportional to the delay spread and hence the delay-spread-bandwidth product
(DSB) is roughly Bβ−1
[11], [12], [23]. In the diﬀusion approximation βc is given
by the Thouless frequency DBL−2 where DB is the Boltzmann diﬀusion constant,
equal to the energy transport velocity times the transport mean free path, and L
the distance of propagation [19], [29].

c

The broadband, frequency-selective (BBFS) channel is naturally deﬁned as having
a large DSB, i.e. Bβ−1
c ≫ 1. Since B < ω0, ω ∈ [ω0 − B/2, ω0 + B/2] and −ω
are separated by more than βc in a BBFS channel. On the other hand, B ≪ βc
corresponds to the narrow-band, frequency-ﬂat (NBFF) channel. For convenience
in the subsequent analysis, we shall think of the NBFF channel as the limit βc → ∞
and the BBFS channel as the limit βc → 0 while ω0, B are ﬁxed. In either case, we
have

Several observations are in order. First, due to τ ≥ (2B)−1 the summation over
l′ in (6) is convergent as W → ∞ uniformly in B. Second, due to the term
F −1
terms in the summation over l
where C = τ −1 is the number of symbols per unit time in each data-stream. As
a result, the variance Vj∼N σ2BM Cµ2 is independent of βc. It then follows that
Vj → 0 if and only if N B ≫ M C for BBFS channels. The transition to the
condition N ≫ M for NBFF channels takes place when B ∼ C, i.e. τ ∼ B−1.

(cid:3)

c

The stability condition can be interpreted as follows: N B is the number of
degrees of freedom in the CSI collected at the TRA per unit time; M C is the
number of degrees of freedom in the ensemble of messages per unit time; the stability
condition N B ≫ M C says that in order to recover the input messages, independent
of the channel realization, and thus reverse the random scrambling by the channel,
the former must be much larger than the latter. In light of this interpretation, the
stability condition derived above appears to be sharp.

A detailed, rigorous analysis of the MIMO-TR channel modeled by a stochas-
tic Schr¨odinger equation, in the parabolic approximation of scalar waves, with a
random potential is given in [12].

4. Rate of information transfer

In this section we discuss the information rate for a memoryless channel which
is constructed out of the time-invariant channel model analyzed in Section 3. The
temporal dependence is introduced by drawing an independent realization from the
Rayleigh-fading ensemble of transfer matrices after each use of the channel, i.e.
after each delay spread (or two if the time for channel estimation is included). This
is obviously an idealization but widely used in communications literature [31], [15].
The coherence time of the resulting ergodic channel model is then much longer
than one delay spread. We assume as in standard practice that in addition to the
random channel ﬂuctuations additive-white-Gaussian-noise (AWGN) is present at
each receiver, that the input signal vector is multivariate Gaussian and that the
channel, the noise and the input signal are mutually independent.

is a sum of a central χ2 random variable with N degrees of freedom and N (M − 1)
i.i.d. mean-zero random variables. This is due to the assumption that diﬀerent
entries of the transfer matrix are mutually independent zero-mean Gaussian ran-
dom variables. Therefore, for N ≫ 1 the interference statistic is approximately
Gaussian, by the Central Limit Theorem. More generally, after synthesizing all the
available frequencies, the interference statistic becomes approximately Gaussian if
N Bβ−1
c ≫ 1 which is always the case for the BBFS channels. In a BBFS (resp.
NBFF) channel, N Bβ−1
(resp. N ) is the number of independent subchannels from

TRA to each receiver.

Moreover, each frequency component of Sj has the mean

which exhibits the simple input-output relation: The ω-component of the input sig-
nal for the j-th receiver is mjg(ω) and the received signal component is N σmjg(ω)
corrupted by the noise and interference which for N ≫ 1 is approximately Gaussian.
Since the M receivers operate independently of one another, the total time-reversal
broadcast channel consists of M independent subchannels in parallel each of which
has the above input-output relation. Thus the total information rate is the sum
of those of the subchannels from TRA to individual receivers. And, in view of
the simple input-output relation, each subchannel can be viewed as a single-input-
single-output (SISO) linear ﬁlter channel corrupted by (approximately) Gaussian
noise/interference for which Shannon’s theorem is applicable.

According to Shannon’s theorem [5] the ergodic capacity (in nats per unit time
and frequency) of a SISO linear ﬁlter channel is ln (1 + SINR) where SINR, the
signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio at each receiver, is given by the harmonic
sum of the SIR, the signal-to-interference ratio and SNR, the signal-to-noise ratio,
i.e. SINR = (SIR−1 + SNR−1)−1. For extension of Shannon’s result to the MIMO
setting, see [15], [31].

Analogous to the NBFF channels in Section 3, SIR(ω) = V −1

j ∼ N/M , inde-
pendent of µ and ω. Let ν be the noise level, per unit frequency, at each receiver.
Suppose the average transmission power is constrained to P and all the transmit
and receive antennas are identical.

Since the value of σ would aﬀect SNR (but not SIR) we discuss the two cases

N ≥ M and N < M separately.

Case 1: N ≥ M . In this case, σ = N −1 and in view of (7), SNR(ω) = µ2/ν
where µ = |mj| can be related to the total power constraint P as µ2M ∼ P/B

since the average input power per unit frequency is

Thus SNR(ω) ∼ P/(νBM ). Therefore the total channel capacity (in nats per unit
time) is roughly given by

Now we ask the question: What is the maximal rate at which a TRA, with ﬁxed
number of elements N , ﬁxed average total power P and ﬁxed noise level (per fre-
quency) ν, can transfer information if there is no limitation to the number of re-
ceivers M and the bandwidth B?

Expression (8) can be optimized at the limit M ≫ P/(νB) to yield the optimal
information rate of P/ν which is linearly proportional to the power. We see that
the simplest strategy for optimizing the information rate of a given TRA under the
the power and noise constraints is to enlarge the bandwidth B as much as possible.
And if we can satisfy N ≫ M ≫ P/(νB) then we can achieve stability as well as
the optimal information rate.

Consider the thermal noise power ν = kBT where kB is the Boltzmann’s constant
and T the temperature. Then the above result implies that the energy cost per nat
is P/R ∼ ν = kBT which is consistent with the classical result of minimum energy
requirement for transmitting one nat information in a simple SISO channel [24],
[21].

Case 2. N ≤ M . This is more typical of broadcast channels in which the
number of receive antennas exceeds the number of transmit antennas. In this case,
σ = M −1 and (7) implies that SNR ∼ N 2µ2/(M 2ν) where µ is related to P by
µ2 = P/(N B). Hence SNR ∼ N P/(M 2νB). With SIR ∼ N/M and Shannon’s
theorem, the channel capacity is roughly

which achieves the optimal rate P/ν in the regime N = M ≫ P/(Bν). On the other
hand, for M ≪ P/(Bν), the information rate becomes BM ln (1 + N/M ) ≤ BN
which is much smaller than P/ν.

(cid:1)

Therefore we conclude that under the power and noise constraints the condition
for the optimal information rate P/ν is N ≥ M ≫ P/(Bν), which can be achieved
by suﬃciently large bandwidth, whereas the additional condition N ≫ M , which,
suﬃcient for the Gaussian approximation to the interference statistic, would also
guarantee stability.

Before ending this section, let us compare the capacity in the conventional, non-
TR MIMO channel as calculated in [15], [31], [22], [30]. Consider the non-TR
single-user channel with the M transmit antennas (on the right of Fig. 1) which
have no channel knowledge and the N (≥ M ) receive antennas (on the left of Fig.
1) as the single user which has perfect CSI. This is, of course, the reciprocal case of
the TR broadcast channel. In this case, SNR ∼ P/(M Bν) and it is shown in [15]
and [31] that the ergodic capacity of the single-user narrowband Rayleigh-fading
channel scales like BM ln SNR at high SNR which can be recovered from (8) by
imposing the additional constraint M ≤ P/(νB) ≤ N . And as we learn from

information rate P/ν.

5. Pinhole effect

Pinholes are degenerate channels that can occur in a wide family of channels,
outdoor as well as indoor, see Fig. 2 and 3. While preserving the co-channel
decorrelation, pinholes have been shown to severely limit the degrees of freedom
and reduce the channel capacity [3], [16], [4].
In this section, we introduce the
notion of eﬀective number of TRA elements to analyze the multi-screen pinhole
eﬀect on TR in Rayleigh fading.

K

Let us begin with the simplest case of single-screen pinholes as illustrated in
Fig. 2. Let h(1)(ω) be the N × K transfer matrix from the TRA to the pinholes
and h(2)(ω) the K × M transfer matrix from the pinhole to the M receivers at
frequency ω. The combined channel can be described by H(ω) = h(2)(ω)h(1)(ω) =

ij (ω) are assumed to be indepen-
[

i,j,ω, are jointly
dent CN (0, σ1) and CN (0, σ2), respectively, and
Gaussian processes. To prevent the average input power from being less than the
average output power we set E|Hij |2 = Kσ1σ2 = (N ∨ M )−1, ∀i, j. Note that the
entries of H are in general not independent r.v.s.

The previous case without pinholes corresponds to the limiting case K ≫ N .
For a ﬁxed K, however, the previous beneﬁt of stability with large number of
TRA elements (N ≫ 1) disappears. The multiple antennas in TRA are essentially
screened out by the pinholes and the eﬀective number of TRA-elements becomes
K.

5.1. Multi-screen pinholes. The same analysis can be applied to channels with
(n − 1) screens of pinholes such as illustrated in Fig. 3. Let Kk, k = 1, ..n − 1 be the
number of k-th screen pinholes. Let h(k) be the transfer matrix for the k-th stage
channel whose entries are independent CN (0, σk) and let the transfer matrices of
diﬀerent stages be mutually independent. Again, in order for the average input
power to be no less than the average output power we set

(12)

E|Hij |2 = K1 · · · Kn−1σ1 · · · σn = (N ∨ M )−1.

The condition of statistical stability, however, is independent of the values of σk, k =
1, ..., n.

As noted previously the the normalized variance does not depend on βc and
its order of magnitude is determined solely by the same-frequency moments which
will be the focus of the subsequent calculation. The calculation of the mean is

According to the Gaussian rule for computing moments, the above expression can
be represented by 2n graphs of 4n vertexes and 2n edges. We distinguish two types
of edges: the arcs, connecting (un)primed indices to (un)primed indices, and the
ladders, connecting unprimed indices to primed indices, see Fig. 4.

graphs is doubled: one half of them contain the ladders connecting h(n+1)

. A moment of reﬂection reveals that the new
pair of arcs impose one more constraint on the ranges of the indices than the new
pair of ladders do. Straightforward graph analysis yields the following observation:
A new pair of arcs add to graphs with outermost arcs the K 2
n (multiplicative)
factor and graphs with outermost ladders the Kn/M factor; on the other hand, a
new pair of ladders add to graphs with outermost ladders the K 2
n factor and graphs
with outermost arcs the KnM factor.

That is, the graphs that correspond to the highest power in K1, K2, · · · , have
the least number of edge-type alternating. Hence for K1, · · · , Kn−1 ≫ 2n ≫ N the
leading order term in the variance corresponds to the graph with all ladders and is
1 · · · K 2
of order K 2
n−1N M while the square of the mean corresponds to the graph
n−1N 2. The stability condition thus remains
with all arcs and is of order K 2
the same as in the case without pinholes.

namely the harmonic sum of N, K1, · · · , Kn−1. We sketch the proof here. The lead-
ing order terms in the variance after expectation correspond to the simple graphs
in which the arcs are nested and are ﬂanked by the ladders, Fig. 4. Except for the
graph with all ladders, the simple graphs all have the innermost arcs connecting
i2,i1 to h(1)∗
h(1)
, which give rise to the factors N 2 (an extra N than
otherwise), and, except for the graphs with all ladders or all arcs, the simple graphs
change the edge-type exactly once (from arc to ladder). When N is comparable
to K1, · · · , Kn−1, the contributions from the simple graphs are comparable to that
from the graph of all edges.

5.2. Information rate with pinholes. The notion of the eﬀective number of
TRA elements is useful in estimating the channel capacity as well as the stability
condition in the presence of pinholes since SIR is given by Neﬀ /M with C = 2B.
As the N K1K2 · · · Kn−1 paths (subchannels) from TRA to each receiver are not
necessarily independent, the simplest condition for Gaussian interference statistic
is Bβ−1
c ≫ 1. That is, in the BBFS channels, each (spatial) path now corresponds
to the sum of Bβ−1

i.i.d. r.v.s. and thus has approximately Gaussian statistic.

c

Due to the normalization (12) the input-output relation in (7) and the discussion
in Section 4 (Case 1 & 2) remain valid if N is replaced by Neﬀ. In particular, the
same optimal information rate P/ν is achieved in the regime Neﬀ ∧ M ≫ P/(Bν).
As analyzed before, when the condition N, K1, .., Kn−1 ≫ 2n is satisﬁed, Neﬀ is
the harmonic sum of N, K1, ..., Kn−1 and therefore we have the estimates: Kmin/n ≤
Neﬀ ≤ Kmax/n where Kmin and Kmax are the minimum and maximum of N, K1, ..., Kn−1,
respectively. On the other hand, when N, K1, .., Kn−1 ≪ 2n, graph analysis shows
that Neﬀ diminishes exponentially with the number of screens, making the alter-
native regime Neﬀ ≤ P/(Bν) much more likely and resulting in low information
rate BNeﬀ (cf. Case 2, Section 4). In other words, a long chain of independently
ﬂuctuating media separated by a series of screens of sparse pinholes is detrimental
to time reversal (and perhaps any) communication systems

6. Conclusions

We have analyzed the time reversal propagation in independent-multi-path Rayleigh-

fading MIMO-channels with or without pinholes. The focus of the analysis is the
stability condition, the multiplexing gain and the multi-screen pinholes eﬀect. The
main results are (i) that the stability holds when M C ≪ NeﬀB for the BBFS
channels and M ≪ Neﬀ for the NBFF channels where Neﬀ is the eﬀective number
of TRA-elements, (ii) that the optimal information rate P/ν under the power and
noise constraints is achieved in the regime Neﬀ ∧ M ≫ P/(Bν) and (iii) that the

12

eﬀective number of TRA-elements is asymptotically the harmonic sum of TRA-
elements and the numbers of pinholes on all n − 1 screens when the numbers of
TRA-elements and the pinholes of each screen are greater than 2n. The stability
condition is a signiﬁcant extension of the previous results [1], [7], [8], [9]. The notion
of the eﬀective number of TRA elements is introduced for the ﬁrst time and shown
to be useful in analyzing stability and capacity in the presence of pinholes.

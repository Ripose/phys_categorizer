Comment on ‘About the magnetic ﬁeld of a ﬁnite wire’∗

Abstract. A ﬂaw in the justiﬁcation given by Charitat and Graner [2003 Eur. J. Phys. 24, 267]
for the use of the Biot–Savart law in the calculation of the magnetic ﬁeld due to a straight
current-carrying wire of ﬁnite length is pointed out.

Charitat and Graner (CG) [1] apply Amp`ere’s theorem and the Biot-Savart law to the
problem of the magnetic ﬁeld produced by a straight wire of ﬁnite length 2l that carries a
current I, and note that these laws lead to diﬀerent results. According to Amp`ere’s theorem,
the magnitude B of the magnetic ﬁeld at a perpendicular distance r from the midpoint along
the length of the wire is B = µ0I/(2πr), while the Biot–Savart law gives this quantity as
B = µ0Il/(2πr√r2 + l2) (the right-hand side of equation (3) of [1] for B cannot be correct as
sin α on the left-hand side there must equal l/√r2 + l2). To explain the fact that Amp´ere’s
theorem and the Biot–Savart law lead here to diﬀerent results, CG say that the former
is applicable only in a time-independent magnetostatic situation, whereas the latter is ‘a
general solution of Maxwell–Amp`ere equations’. A straight wire of ﬁnite length can carry a
current only when there is a current source at one end of the wire and a curent sink at the
other end—and this is possible only when there are time-dependent net charges at both ends
of the wire. These charges create a time-dependent electric ﬁeld and thus the problem is
outside the domain of magnetostatics (we note that the time-dependent ﬂux of this electric
ﬁeld is used in equation (7) of [1] with the incorrect sign; the desired result for the magnetic
ﬁeld can be there obtained simply by using the fact that ∂q(t)/∂t =

I).

We would like to point out that both the Coulomb and Biot–Savart laws have to be
generalized to give correctly the electric and magnetic ﬁelds due to general time-dependent
charge and current sources ρ(r, t) and J (r, t). These generalizations are given by the now
well-publicized Jeﬁmenko’s equations [2–4]:

R/c is the retarded time. Jeﬁmenko’s
where R =
equation (2) for the magnetic ﬁeld reduces to the standard Biot–Savart law only when one
can replace in the integrand the retarded time t′ with the current time t and drop the term
with the time derivative of the current density. Obviously, this can be done when the current
density is constant in time, but, nontrivially, also when the current density at the retarded
time t′ is given suﬃciently accurately by the ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion about the current
time t (see [4], problem 10.12):

The Biot–Savart solution to the problem under discussion is thus correct when the con-
dition (3) is satisﬁed, as, for example, when the current I is constant in time or varies with
time only linearly. However, CG’s contention that the standard Biot–Savart law is a general
solution to the Maxwell–Amp`ere equation ∇×B = µ0J + c−2∂E/∂t is incorrect. Contrary
to an assertion of CG, the curl of a non-retarded vector potential (the r2 in equation (8)
of [1] for this quantity is obviously a misprint) does not result in a magnetic ﬁeld that sat-
isﬁes that equation in general. Only the curl of a retarded vector potential, which yields
Jeﬁmenko’s generalization (2) of the Biot–Savart law,

is, together with Jeﬁmenko’s generalization (1) of the Coulomb law, a general solution of

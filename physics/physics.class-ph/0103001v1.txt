About forces, acting on radiating charge

Abstract. It is shown, that the force acting on a radiating charge is stipulated by two rea-
sons - owing to exchange of a momentum between radiating charge and electromagnetic ﬁeld of
radiation, and also between a charge and ﬁeld accompanying the charge.

It is well known that the charged particle moving with acceleration radiates, and as a result
an additional force (apart from the external one, ~F0) - force of radiation reaction acts on it.
In present paper it is shown, that this force (we shall call it as a self-action force or simply
by self-action) is a sum of two parts: the ﬁrst force is due to the exchange of the momentum
between a particle and radiation ﬁelds, i.e. the ﬁelds, which go away to inﬁnity. For the second
force in the exchange of a momentum the ﬁelds, accompanying a charge participate as well.
These ﬁelds do not go away to inﬁnity, i.e. at inﬁnity they have zero ﬂux of energy (details see
below).

We shall start with the momentum conservation law for a system of charge and electromag-

netic ﬁeld [1], [2]

where ~P - is the particle momentum, ~E and ~H - are the vectors for electromagnetic ﬁeld, ~n -
is the normal to the surface S, enclosing volume V . On the right of formula (1) the external
force ~F0 is omitted. From (1) we can see, that apart from external force, two forces act on the
particle: force ~f1, expressed by a surface integral, and force ~f2 expressed by a volume integral.
As a surface S we shall take sphere of a large radius R → ∞, with the centre at the point
of instantaneous place of the charge, then ~n = ~R/R. For ~E and ~H we shall use the known
expressions for the ﬁelds created by a charged particle moving with arbitrary velocity ~v (t) [2],

Calculating the force ~f1 we have to substitute in (1) the term with a lowest order of R−1
(the second term on the right in (2)), corresponding, to spherical electromagnetic ﬁelds going
away to inﬁnity, i.e. radiation ﬁelds. Then, taking into account the remark after formula (2), it
is possible to write the force ~f1 in the form

The formula (3) allows the following clear interpretation of the origin of the force ~f1 : the
radiation in a direction ~n per unit time carries away with itself momentum ~ndIn/c, and therefore,
the charge acquires a momentum −~ndIn/c. As the change of a momentum per unit time is equal
to the acting force, then as a result of radiation in a direction ~n the force will act on the particle,
equal to d ~f1 = −~ndIn/c.
Integrating over all directions (over total solid angle), we get the
expression for the force ~f1(details for calculation see in [4]):

In this formula uk = dxk/ds is the four-velocity and ds = cdt/gamma is the Minkowskian
interval (we follow the notations of the book [3]).

Now we turn to the force ~f2. Here it is necessary to take into account the contribution of
both summands in formula (2). The calculations are too long and, as it is easy to see, lead to
integrals, divergent at both small and long distances. The latters are related to the divergences
of the self-energy and momentum for the point charge ﬁeld. To avoid these diﬃculties, we shall
act as follows. Let’s write a three-dimensional equation of motion d~p/dt = ~f = ~f1+ ~f2 in the
four-dimensional (covariant) form

by entering the four-dimensional momentum pi = mcui = (γmc, ~p) and force gi =

As it follows from the deﬁnition of the force ~f2 and formula (2), where the vectors ~β and
˙~β enter only, four-dimensional vector gi
2 can be expressed through the vectors ui, dui/ds and
d2ui/ds2 only. The ﬁrst possibility disappears as for ~v = const, should be gi
2 = 0. The summand
containing dui/ds is united with a left-hand side of equation (7) and leads to the renormalization
2 = αd2ui/ds2, where α = 2e2/3c
of the charged particle mass, so that it remains the possibility gi
is a number (four-dimensional scalar), which is determined from the requirement, that for an
arbitrary four-dimensional force gi should be giui = 0 (to see this it is necessary to use identity
uiui = 1 and its consequences as well). Hence

In the nonrelativistic case (β ≪ 1), at ﬁrst approximation over β from (10) we get the
following expression for the self-action force (by the way we shall indicate, that there was an
error in the formula (6) in article [5])

hand side of (11) dominates, then ~f = ~f ′; depending on the law ~β (t), the second summand can
dominate. Generally, for β ≪ 1, for self-action force it is necessary to use the formula (11).

The above mentioned allows us to state that the total self-action force acting on a radiating
charge is determined by formula (10) and it is more appropriate to call a reaction force of
radiation the force ~f1 determined by formula (5). This force is always nonzero when the particle
moves with acceleration and hence radiates.

From this point of view let’s consider again uniformly accelerated motion (for arbitrary

velocities). It is known that the condition for uniformly accelerated motion has the form [7]

¨~β = 0

As a result for this motion the vector ~A goes to zero and this is the case for the self-action
force. However the radiation and radiation reaction force are nonzero, because the acceleration
is nonzero. The latter can be easily obtained from the equation d~p/dt = ~F0 + ~f and is determined
by the formula

(cid:16)
In our case for ~β|| ~F0, ~F0 = const, the acceleration is equal to

Hence, for the uniformly accelerated motion the only force acting on charge is the external force
~F0 (it can be easily checked that for the acceleration (15) the self-action force is zero). For
~β → 1 the acceleration tends to zero, and in the case ~β → 0 the acceleration, as it is expected,
is equal to

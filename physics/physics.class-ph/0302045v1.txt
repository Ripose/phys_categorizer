Nothing but Relativity

Palash B. Pal

Abstract

We deduce the most general space-time transformation laws consistent
with the principle of relativity. Thus, our result contains the results
of both Galilean and Einsteinian relativity. The velocity addition law
comes as a bi-product of this analysis. We also argue why Galilean and
Einsteinian versions are the only possible embodiments of the principle
of relativity.

Historically, Einstein’s special theory of relativity was motivated by consider-
ations of properties of light. Even today, textbooks and other expositions of the
special theory rely heavily on gedanken experiments involving light. The Lorentz
transformation equations, the formula for relativistic addition of velocities, and other
important formulas of the special theory are derived using light signals.

There are two assumptions, or axioms, underlying the special theory of relativity.
One is the principle of relativity, which asserts that physical laws appear the same
to any inertial observer. The other, which marks the diﬀerence of Einstein’s theory
with the earlier Galilean theory of relativity, is the assertion of the constancy of the
speed of light in the vacuum.

An interesting question to ask, therfore, is the following. Suppose one takes
the principle of relativity, but does not take the second axiom of Einstein. One
would then obtain the most general formulas equations which are consistent with the
principle of relativity. Such formulas would contain both Galilean and Einsteinian
results. This question has been asked before in the literature [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11], and the authors have derived the relativistic velocity addition law in some
cases, the space-time transformation equations in some other. Here, we present an
approach to the same problem which is somewhat diﬀerent, and at the end, both the
space-time transformations and the velocity addition law come out from the same
exercise.

Let us consider two inertial frames S and S′, where the second one moves with
a speed v, along the x-axis, with respect to the ﬁrst one. The co-ordinates and time

in the S-frame will be denoted by x and t, and in the frame S′, they will be denoted
with a prime. The space-time transformation equations have the form

and our task is to determine these functions. A few properties of these functions
can readily be observed. First, the principle of relativity tells us that if we invert
these equations, we must obtain the same functional forms:

x′ = X(x, t, v) ,
t′ = T (x, t, v) ,

x = X(x′, t′,
t = T (x′, t′,

v) ,

v) .

v, since that is the velocity
Notice that here the third argument of the functions is
of the frame S with respect to S′. Using Eqs. (1) and (2) now, we can rewrite Eqs.
(3) and (4) as:

−

x = X (X(x, t, v), T (x, t, v),

v) ,

t = T (X(x, t, v), T (x, t, v),

v) ,

−

−

which are implicit constraints on the forms of the functions. Moreover, isotropy of
space demands that we could take the x-axis in the reverse direction as well. In this
case, both x and v change sign, and so does x′. In other words,

X(

x, t,

v) =

X(x, t, v) ,

−

T (

x, t,

v) =

T (x, t, v) .

We now invoke the homogeneity of space and time. Suppose there is a rod
placed along the x-axis such that its ends are at points x1 and x2 in the frame
S, with x2 > x1. In the frame S′, the ends will be at the points X(x1, t, v) and
X(x2, t, v), so that the length would be

l′ = X(x2, t, v)

X(x1, t, v) .

−

Suppose we now displace the rod such that its end which used to be at x1 is now at
the point x1 + h. Its length in the frame S should not be aﬀected by its position on
the x-axis by virtue of the principle of homogeneity of space, so that its other end
should now be at the point x2 + h. In the frame S′, its ends will be at the points
X(x2 + h, t, v) and X(x1 + h, t, v). However, homogeneity of space implies that the
length of the rod should not be aﬀected in the frame S′ as well, so that

l′ = X(x2 + h, t, v)

X(x1 + h, t, v) .

−

(10)

Using Eqs. (9) and (10), we obtain

X(x2 + h, t, v)

−

X(x2, t, v) = X(x1 + h, t, v)

−

X(x1, t, v) .

Since the points x2 and x1 are completely arbitrary, this implies that the partial
independent of the point x. Thus, the function
derivative ∂X/∂x is constant,
X(x, t, v) must be a linear function of x. One can similarly argue, invoking the
homogeneity of time as well, that both X(x, t, v) and T (x, t, v) are linear in the
arguments x and t. In that case, making the trivial choice that the origins of the
two frames coincide, i.e., x = t = 0 implies x′ = t′ = 0, we can write

X(x, t, v) = Avx + Bvt ,

T (x, t, v) = Cvx + Dvt ,

where the subscript v on the co-eﬃcients A, B, C and D remind us that they are
functions of the relative velocity v only. Eqs. (7) and (8) then imply that

A−v = Av , B−v =

Bv , C−v =

Cv , D−v = Dv .

(15)

−

−

In other words, A and D are even functions, while B and C are odd functions of
v. Using these properties, we can now use Eqs. (5) and (6) to obtain the following
conditions:

Unfortunately, these four equations do not solve the four functions A, B, C and
D. The reason is simple. Eqs. (17) and (18) indicate two possibilities. Either
Bv = Cv = 0, in which case the other two equation say that Av = Dv = 1, which
is just the trivial solution of identity transformation. While this is mathematically
a valid possiblity, physically it is not acceptable for arbitrary values of v. Thus we
look at the other case, which gives

Thus, two of the functions of v introduced in Eqs. (13) and (14) are independent.

In fact, we can reduce the number of independent functions further if we notice
that by our deﬁnition, the origin of the frame S′ is moving at a speed v with respect
to the origin of S, i.e., at time t, it must be at the point x = vt. In other words,
x′ = 0 when x = vt. This implies

So far, the functional form of Av is unknown, except for the fact that it is an
even function of v, and that it must equal unity when v = 0. However, we can go
further if we now consider a third frame S′′ which is moving with a speed u with
respect to S′. Then

But the left side of this equation depends only on v, while the right side depends
only on u. They can be equal only if they are constants. Denoting this constant by
K, we obtain

Using this form in Eq. (23), we thus obtain that the most general transformation
equations consistent with the principle of relativity are of the form

Another thing to notice is that the velocity addition law can be directly deduced
from our analysis. For this, let us call the speed of the frame S′′ with respect to S
by w. Then, in Eq. (24), the diagonal terms of the matrix must be Aw:

Aw = AuAv + (A

using in the last step the deﬁnition of K which follows from Eq. (25). Given the
form of the function A from Eq. (26), it is now easy to deduce that

which is the velocity addition law.

Speciﬁc theories of relativity, of course, have to make extra assumptions in order
to determine the value of K. In the case of Galilean relativity, this extra assumption
shows up in the form of the universality of time, which means t′ = t for any v.
Obviously, this requires K = 0. The extra assumption for Einstein’s theory of
relativity is the constancy of the speed of light in vacuum. From Eq. (29), it is easy
to see that K −1/2 is an invariant speed, independent of the frame of reference. Thus,
K = 1/c2 > 0 in this case. It is obvious that in both these cases, we obtain the
appropriate transformation laws from Eq. (27) and the velocity addition law from
Eq. (29).

From this line of reasoning, it seems that there should be another logical possi-
bility with K < 0. Actually, this option is not self-consistent. To see this, we ﬁrst
look at Eq. (26), and note that only the positive square root can be taken in the
expression on the right hand side, because we want Av to reduce to unity when v
1/C 2
vanishes. Thus, Av ≥
for some ﬁnite value of C, we can obtain Aw < 0 from Eq. (28) if we choose large
enough values of u and v which satisfy uv > C 2.

0 for any v. However, if K is negative, i.e., K =

−

One point has to be made here. For the case of Einsteinian relativity as well, one
can reach a contradiction, viz., that Av becomes imaginary if v > c. But such large
speeds are unreachable in Einsteinian relativity due to the structure of the addition
law of Eq. (29), which shows that one cannot obtain w > c if both u and v are less
1/C 2, this is not the case. One can add two speeds, both less
than c. For K =
than C, and the result of addition can be larger than C. For example, if the speed
of S′ is C/2 with respect to S, and if S′′ moves with a speed C/2 with respect to
S′, the speed of S′′ from the S-frame is 4C/3. Thus, speeds larger than C cannot
be excluded from this theory, but such speeds raise the possibility of having Aw < 0
as outlined above. Hence the inconsistency.

−

Thus, in eﬀect, we have deduced the most general space-time transformation
law as well as the velocity addition law consistent with the principle of relativity,
and have shown that Galilean and Einsteinian laws are the only possible ones. Our
method most closely resembles that of Singh [10], but there are important diﬀerences.
In his derivation, Singh used some properties of the velocity addition law deduced
by Mermin [7]. We have not used them. On the other hand, we have made direct
use of the isotropy of space to deduce the symmetry properties of the functions A,
B, C and D which have been summarized in Eq. (15) and used them to obtain Eqs.
(16-19). But the most important diﬀerence, to our mind, is that while previous
derivations used distinct lines of reasoning for the space-time transformation laws
and the velocity addition formula, our argument gives both at the same stroke.

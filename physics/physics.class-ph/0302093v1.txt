We describe the results of an experiment to test for spacetime anisotropy terms that might exist
from Lorentz violations. The apparatus consists of a pair of cylindrical superconducting cavity-
stabilized oscillators operating in the TM010 mode with one axis east-west and the other vertical.
Spatial anisotropy is detected by monitoring the beat frequency at the sidereal rate and its ﬁrst
harmonic. We see no anisotropy to a part in 1013. This puts a comparable bound on four linear
combinations of parameters in the general Standard Model extension, and a weaker bound of <
4 × 10

−9 on three others.

PACS numbers: 11.30.Cp, 03.30.+p

Tests of spacetime anisotropy are generally divided
into two main classes, one involving angle dependent ef-
fects and the other absolute velocity eﬀects. Following
Robertson [1], a treatment of potential Lorentz invari-
ance violations involving idealized rods and clocks was
developed by Mansouri and Sexl [2] who considered the
possibility of an anisotropic propagation velocity of light
relative to a preferred frame. In this model, if a labo-
ratory is assumed to be moving with a velocity v at an
angle θ relative to the axis of a preferred frame, the speed
of light as a function of θ and v is given by

analysis. A simple conﬁguration that can be analyzed
easily consists of a pair of cylindrical microwave cav-
ity resonators operating on radial modes with their axes
aligned in the east-west direction and optimally at 45◦ to
the Earth’s axis, as indicated in Fig. 1. This apparatus
will in general have a diﬀerent sensitivity to the coeﬃ-
cients of the Lorentz violating terms than an optical cav-
ity experiment because of the radial nature of the wave
motions involved. Each cavity will provide its own frac-
tional oﬀset signal δν/ν from its unperturbed frequency.
The beat signal from such a pair, ∆ν/ν = δν1/ν − δν2/ν,
takes the general form

where α is the time dilation parameter, β is the Lorentz
contraction parameter,and δ tests for transverse contrac-
tion. In special relativity the last two terms on the right
hand side of the equation are zero. Classical Michelson-
Morley experiments attempt to measure the amplitude of
the θ-dependent term, while Kennedy-Thorndyke exper-
iments set limits on the amplitude of the θ-independent
term. While useful to help categorize experiments, this
approach has a number of limitations. For example, it
fails to include eﬀects on the measurement system it-
self and it does not take into account the full range of
anisotropies allowable in nature.

Recently Kosteleck´y and Mewes [3] (KM) have pointed
out that in the Standard Model Extension (SME) that
describes general Lorentz violations [4], additional terms
may exist which show signatures diﬀerent from those ex-
pressed in Eq. (1). In particular, sin θ and sin 2θ terms
may exist independent of v which could be detectable in
the experiments, as well as terms ﬁrst order in v/c. No
systematic search for these terms appears to have been
undertaken in the optical experiments conducted until
now, although a number of tests have been performed
with fermions and with astrophysical sources [5]. Also,
experiments involving the Earth’s rotation typically use
co-rotating frequency references which complicates the

∆ν
ν

(1)

+Bs sin 2ωt + Bc cos 2ωt + C

(2)

where the coeﬃcients are linear combinations of poten-
tial Lorentz violating terms in the SME and 2π/ω is the
Earth’s sidereal period. The term C has an annual vari-
ation that can be neglected here. In zero and ﬁrst order
of v/c the quantities A and B contain exclusively SME
terms, while higher order terms would of course include
the more traditional eﬀects described by Eq. (1). The
cavity which is oriented in the east-west direction is max-
imally sensitive to the second harmonic terms in Eq. (2),
while the cavity oriented 45◦ to the Earth’s axis is max-
imally sensitive to the ﬁrst harmonic terms [6]. A search
for the lower order terms would probe for new physics
that might for example correspond to residual eﬀects left
over from the birth of the universe. Because of the ex-
treme sensitivity of modern cavity resonators and clocks
it is possible to put useful bounds on such possibilities.
When limited to the photon sector the Lagrangian de-

scribing the SME can be written in the form [7]

Lorentz violations. Stringent limits exist on the size of
the kAF term, but the CPT-even kF term is only partially
constrained [3]. KM deﬁne matrices ˜κe+, ˜κe−, ˜κo+ and
˜κo− and ˜κtr with elements that are parity even and parity
odd combinations of the coeﬃcients kF . These matrices
arise naturally in the analogous situation of wave prop-
agation in a homogeneous anisotropic medium. Astro-
physical tests constrain ˜κe+ and ˜κo− at the 10−32 level
[8], while the other matrices are currently only weakly
constrained. These include nine additional coeﬃcients
of kF of which eight are in principle accessible via the
present experimental conﬁguration. Of these, four con-
tribute directly to a possible frequency shift and three
at ﬁrst order in v/c, leading to high sensitivity tests.
Detailed expressions relating the coeﬃcients of Lorentz
violation to those in Eq. (2) have been given by KM up
to ﬁrst order in v/c.

In our experiment we compare the frequencies of two
cylindrical superconducting microwave cavities operating
in the TM010 mode [9] which gives sensitivity to the ve-
locity of light in radial directions. One cavity has its
axis oriented to the local vertical at our latitude of 37.4◦
while the other axis is oriented to the local horizontal
in the east-west direction. The cavities are made of nio-
bium and are operated at about 1.4K in conventional he-
lium Dewars. Microwave synthesizers are locked to the
8.6 GHz modes of the cavities using Pound frequency
discrimination systems, and the diﬀerence frequency is
mixed with an intermediate frequency oscillator to pro-
duce a beat signal in the 20 - 30 Hz range. Data was
collected at irregular intervals over a 98-day period dur-
ing a development program for a related experiment to
be performed in space [10]. Nine records were obtained,
each corresponding to a continuous segment of data at
least 24 hrs long. Frequency sampling was at one second
intervals, with averaging of 100 second segments before
curve ﬁtting was performed. An example of one of the
records is shown in Fig. 2(a). Typically the records were
collected after some other form of testing on the appa-

ratus was completed. This situation leads to arbitrary
oﬀsets of up to a few Hz between the records. Also,
mechanical disturbances occasionally gave rise to a per-
ceptible drift of the beat frequency amounting to a few
mHz per day. We therefore ﬁtted each record with the
function

where ν0 and ν1 were additional free parameters. The
residuals from the ﬁt to the record in Fig. 2(a) are shown
in Fig. 2(b). The values obtained for the coeﬃcients of
the sinusoidal terms are listed in Table I along with the
day of the record [11]. It can be seen that the amplitudes
As, Ac, Bs and Bc are in the low 10−13 − 10−14 range,
with no obvious trend with time. XY plots of the sine and
cosine coeﬃcients are shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). To
test for an alignment of the observed signals with inertial
space we also made the XY plots after phase shifting the
sine and cosine coeﬃcients to sidereal time, obtaining the
results in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d). For these plots the time
origin was also shifted to the 2002 vernal equinox. No
signiﬁcant reduction of the scatter is evident.

A study of the behavior of the apparatus at other times
disclosed a high sensitivity of the signal from one of the
cavities to tilt which appears to be the dominant limit to
the experiment. A second eﬀect was the stability of the
temperature of the cavity. This was controlled to within
±5 × 10−6 K using a germanium resistance thermome-
ter mounted on the cavity and a servoed heater. The

dominant source of temperature ﬂuctuation was the 1.4
K cooling system. A proportional-integral temperature
controller was used, but thermal gradients within the cav-
ity assembly could cause some undetected coupling with
room temperature. A ratio transformer bridge was used
for the germanium thermometer with a reference resistor
at 1.4 K. This conﬁguration typically gives stabilities of
better than 1 µK. The temperature coeﬃcient of the cav-
ity frequency was -28 Hz/K which would imply frequency
oﬀsets on the order of ±0.15 mHz, but this could be am-
pliﬁed by thermal gradient eﬀects. With servo powers of
the order 10−5 W, temperature diﬀerences of as much as
5×10−5 K would be expected in the cavity support struc-
ture. A number of correlation studies were performed
but only a modest reduction of the amplitudes in Table
I was obtained. Discussion of this aspect of the analysis
is lengthy and will be presented elsewhere. We suspect
that the signal amplitudes in Table I are dominated by
mechanical eﬀects in the low temperature apparatus.

From the plots in Fig. 3 it seems reasonable to con-
clude that there is no signiﬁcant evidence for an iner-
tially oriented frequency shift in our experiment. Treat-
ing the variation of the observed signal amplitudes as
locally generated ”noise” we can average the data in
each direction and derive bounds on any signal. Us-
ing the coeﬃcients from Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) we obtain
¯Ac = −8.5 ± 10.4 × 10−14, ¯As = 4.2 ± 8.8 × 10−14,
¯Bc = −2.0 ± 4.3 × 10−14 and ¯Bs = 5.8 ± 5.9 × 10−14
where the errors correspond to the statistical 2σ level.
Because of the likely presence of unmodeled systematic
eﬀects and the small number of records, we consider the
conﬁdence level in these results to be closer to the 60%
or 1σ level. The results imply that certain linear com-
binations of the kF coeﬃcients are constrained at the
10−13 level. For example, neglecting contributions of
order v/c and higher, the As term can be written as
A0
s = 1/4 sin 2χ(3˜κe+ + ˜κe−)Y Z where χ is the colatitude
of the experiment [12]. Setting (˜κe+)Y Z = 0 on the ba-
sis of the extremely tight astrophysical bound < 10−32,

reduces to sin 2χ[(kF )XY XZ − (kF )0Y 0Z ]/4. Similar re-
lations can be derived for the other amplitudes in Eq.
(2). Alternatively, the experiment can be viewed as
setting the following bounds on elements of the (˜κe−)
(˜κe−)Y Z < 1.7 ± 3.6 × 10−13; (˜κe−)XZ <
matrix:
−3.5 ± 4.3 × 10−13; (˜κe−)XY < 1.4 ± 1.4 × 10−13;
[(˜κe−)XX − (˜κe−)Y Y ] < −1.0 ± 2.1 × 10−13.

As described by KM, three more coeﬃcients are in-
troduced at the level v/c, where v is the velocity of the
Earth around the Sun. The additional term in As can
be written as

A1

sin 2χ cos ΩT [sin η(˜κo+)ZX − cos η(˜κo+)Y X ] (5)

where 2π/Ω is the orbital period of the Earth, T is the
time measured from the vernal equinox and η is the an-
gle between the Earth’s orbital and equatorial planes.
Evaluating this expression for our situation we obtain
s = 9.75 × 10−6[(˜κo+)Y X − 0.432(˜κo+)ZX ] where we

term is also bounded at the level of 4.2 × 10−14, imply-
ing a constraint on the term inside the square brackets
of < 4.0 ± 8.4 × 10−9, assuming no cancellation between
the terms [13]. Similar expressions can be derived for the
other coeﬃcients in Eq. (4). For clarity, the entire set of
constraints obtained from the measurements is given in

could be obtained by extending the data gathering pe-
riod to a larger fraction of a year when it would become
reasonable to include the annual modulation terms in the
ﬁt to the data. At the present level, the experiment sets
bounds of < 4 × 10−9 on four expressions of the type
in square brackets in Eq. (5). We note that by mixing
the experimental bounds, a cleaner separation of the ˜κo+
components can be obtained.

By restricting the Lagrangian in Eq. (3) to the pho-
ton sector, the model omits a range of potential eﬀects
from the material that makes up the apparatus. Within
the full SME these possibilities lead to considerable com-
plexity, but KM argue that complete cancellation of the
photon sector eﬀects is improbable due to the complex-
ity of the forces involved. In very recent work M¨uller et
al.
[14] have considered these eﬀects and ﬁnd a small
enhancement of the photon eﬀects in the case of ionic
crystalline materials.

In summary, we have set bounds at the 10−13 level on
four combinations of parameters in the SME, and bounds
at the 10−9 level on four others. These bounds now con-
strain seven of the nine unknown coeﬃcients kF in the
model. We note that in a space-based version of this ex-
periment [10], substantially greater sensitivity could be
achieved, perhaps approaching the 10−17 level for the
four primary bounds.

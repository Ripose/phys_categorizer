The probabilistic character of Quantum Mechanics as well as the formal similarity of the Schr¨oedinger equation to
the diﬀusion equation raised from long ago the question of a possible stochastic justiﬁcation to Quantum Mechanics
[1]. A ﬁrst formal approach was developed by Nelson [2] and up to now many authors presented complementary or
alternative works (a few of them listed in [3]- [6]) on the subject named usually as Stochastic Mechanics. A common
goal of these theories lie on the possibility of ﬁnd a stochastic process that is equivalent to Quantum Mechanics.
Nevertheless no such a process was yet proposed that lent to Stochastic Mechanics, in any of its presented forms, a
explicit advantage over the sophisticated epistemological structure of Quantum Theory. On another way Quantum
Theory is continuously tested at deeper levels ﬁxing its place as fundamental one although this do not invalidate the
search for alternative interpretations, hopefully not subject to inconsistencies (like inﬁnities) yet plaguing the theory.
In this work we focus on a somewhat diﬀerent approach where a particular kind of stochastic process is studied.
We present a perturbation theory for the associated probability density function that has quantum formalism as a
subjacent dynamics but still preserving the classical nature of the theory. We also discuss a possible physical origin for
the noise source capable of describe the type of process we study. No full equivalence to Quantum Theory was found
so this indicates that Quantum Mechanics as a fundamental theory is preserved also. Nevertheless our formulation
shows explicitly that quantal aspects may appear quite naturally in a classical theory.

Once every physical process include or can generate some sort of noise the motion of a massive particle under its
inﬂuence is an important subject in the study of real particle’s dynamics. For a particular class of noise - the Wiener
process - a rigorous probability formalism can be obtained where a ﬁeld equation - the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE)
- for the probability density function of some noise-dependent variable is deﬁned [7]. For this case noise source has
an uncorrelated stationary probability distribution and when the stochastic process under study describes speciﬁcally
the motion of a particle the resulting process is the Brownian motion. Due to its generality a FPE can be considered
as a fundamental although its detailed predictions are dependent of the speciﬁc Wiener process considered.

The origin of noise that a particle in Brownian motion is subject usually is thermodynamic. This is the case of
a particle dispersed on a ﬂuid at some temperature. There thermal noise gives a bit of energy to the particle and
dissipative eﬀects returns it back (randomly) to the thermal bath. The net eﬀect is a random walk equilibrated to the
bath’s temperature. Here we will consider this kind of motion but with two main diﬀerences. First the particle is in
vacuum and noise is generated by vacuum ﬂuctuations of some quantum ﬁeld capable of interaction with that particle.
Second the motion is not dissipative. This last hypotesis seems to be at ﬁrst sight unrealistic because particle may
gain energy from nothing. We accept it for simplicity since this hypotesis do not invalidate the methods we present
here for the general case.

One may argue against the reality of vacuum ﬂuctuations itself. This subject has yet some controversy but its
theoretical as well as experimental grounds has been suﬃciently discussed in the literature [9] and we can accept
it in a general basis. Moreover recent careful measurements of Casimir forces [10] demonstrated a good agreement
between observation and theoretical predictions reinforcing our belief in its physical existence. Generally we even can
believe that geometry changes in a physically conﬁned systems may induce a small violation of energy conservation
principle, undetectable by today’s instrument sensitivity or be possible that during molecular conformational changes
some energy comes from vacuum, involving van der Walls force. We think these arguments are suﬃcient to justify
a possible existence of a natural noise source interacting to any elementary particle coming from vacuum properties.
Besides all we must also have in mind that every charged particle is subject to the cosmic background radiation
ﬁeld that is real and also stochastic. Therefore we think that stochastic process are inevitable to the motion of
massive particles in vacuum, coming as a intrinsic part of the reality in Nature and must be considered in any precise
description of this kind of motion.

The method we give here to solve the FPE for the Brownian motion has general validity and no fundamental
diﬃculties are present when the more general case where not only dissipative eﬀects as well as a larger class of
Wiener process are considered. Speciﬁcally for a quantum noise coming from vacuum ﬂuctuations we understand a
ω2
stationary Wiener-type source with noise intensity proportional to a ”vacuum power ” which we write as
and with mean energy

a simple averaging process unless a physical cutoﬀ at high frequencies exist. This must be achieved by multiplying
the instantaneous vacuum modes by the appropriate cross section (in that frequency) which falls oﬀ properly at high
energies. If doing so the instantaneous momentum transferred to the particle may be calculated resulting in a noise
source with zero mean and the desired power in as much as in the Casimir eﬀect [11] calculation where high frequencies
modes cancel out and the net eﬀect comes from low frequencies modes only. This is analogous to the thermal eﬀect
where the enormous kinetic energy of one mol of molecules at room temperature has minimal action over the center of
mass motion of a macroscopic body because the random collisions between the molecules and the body are isotropic
so the net resulting eﬀect are small ﬂuctuations. Nevertheless if the phenomena we describe here has to be universal
it is reasonable that
should be a characteristic mensurable constant in Nature even though we concentrate here only
on the eﬀect on particle motion of a noise source with properties listed above and explicit in the perturbative series
expansion procedure we give below. Therefore besides eqn (1) detailed physical origin of

our calculations in the present stage of development of our reasoning.

B. Perturbation expansion for the Fokker-Planck equation

In sequence we give the precise mathematical formulation of the kind of motion we want to describe. Particle’s
dynamics arise from Hamilton equations plus a Langevin term acting as a stochastic force. We assume no explicit
stochastic term for position variable meaning that any random eﬀect on it comes indirectly through coupling with
the momentum term resulting in a non-dissipative Brownian motion. More precisely we have

Here m is particle’s mass and dW (t) a stationary Wiener-type stochastic variable with noise power
Rigorously speaking if the particle has a electric charge it radiates when accelerated which is a kind of an intrinsic
unremovable dissipative eﬀect. In this work we assume these eﬀects as small thus leaving out any radiation reaction
terms and deserving for a future work a proper inclusion of appropriate corrections.

which unless a missing dissipative term has the same structure of the Kramers’ equation [12], orginaly written to
describe the motion of a large mass particle in a ﬂuid at thermal equilibrium with a bath in such a way that noise
comes from the temperature eﬀect cited above. As already discussed this motion is unstable against inﬁnitesimal
stochastic perturbations. In fact even if the intensity √2m
of the Langevin term goes to zero a smeared phase space
P
still results. We observe that in this case the above equation reduces to the Liouville equation which admits a class
of solutions concentrated along the deterministic trajectories in phase space describing particle’s classical motion. In
fact if Hcl (t)
2m + V (xcl (t)) is the Hamiltonian of the (deterministic) Hamilton equations one class of solutions
for Liouville equation is

We see that trajectories (in phase space) no longer exist any more: position and momentum variables decouple and
information about the system is supplied by an ensemble of states in thermal equilibrium at temperature β−1. This
temperature eﬀect is the only memory of the ghost stochastic eﬀect and is caused by the known singular small noise
expansion of the FPE [7]. Thus there is a big diﬀerence if we take Hamilton equations without noise to get a full
deterministic motion and a FPE with null noise term. In the ﬁrst case the topology of phase space as represented by
Poincare maps are sets of points even when the motion is chaotic whereas a probability density function continuously
ﬁlls phase space in the another case.

following in mean the second Newton’s law. Note that the mean exchanged momentum with stochastic source is

source . Position variable is also aﬀected although there is no noise source acting directly on it. Its mean value and

Thereby classical laws of motion are satisﬁed only in mean no matter the value of the noise intensity as shown by
eqns (8)and (9). We must conclude that a ﬁeld dynamics for the probability density should exist even for zero noise
power and it will be shown bellow it follows exactly quantum dynamics when our perturbative schema is considered.
We develop in sequence the perturbative expansion. To do this we shall use ~ in order to Fourier Transform
Φ (x, p, t) in momentum to the adjoint space
associated to this variable. In the present formalism this space refer
to wavelengths of a mode decomposition of the probability density function. Diﬀerently from Quantum Theory here
position and momentum are not related by an unitary transformation between adjoint spaces. This happens for
momentum and wavelengths of waves of probability density having momentum p = ~y. It is in this space the FPE
has a form suitable to the structure of the perturbative series we look for. Nextly we write

/~c is the mean vacuum ﬂuctuation wavelength and τ the particle’s Compton length divided by the

velocity of light. We stress that phase space probability density Φ (x, p, t) is similar but has to be not confused with
the Wigner function [13] in Quantum Theory. The former satisﬁes exactly the Liouville equation for zero noise power.
Wigner function satisﬁes it only approximately. Moreover in a Fourier transform on momentum variable of the Wigner
function similar to eqn(11) variable y has the meaning of position. Speciﬁcally in the Wigner function the role of x
and y are symmetric so they share the same physical meaning whereas in this work simbols x and y are trully indepent
variables that play diﬀerent role. It will be shown explicitly later that in fact both functions do not coincide.

Owing to the structure of the eqn(12) it is natural to think in a Taylor expansion of χ (x, y, t) in the variable y
which should be convenient because this way we may compare probability wavelengths to vacuum wavelength (that
is very big) as expressed by the fraction present in the last term of this equation. This perturbative schema has the
advantage that it permits a controll of noise eﬀects over ﬁeld dynamics for χ. Saying diﬀerently if particle’s kinetic
~/p is very small compared to vacuum
energy is much greater than vacuum energy
wavelength λ thus making noise eﬀects negligible. But a inﬁnite series in powers of y has no simple inverse Fourier
representation generating a somewhat pathological phase space reconstruction. For vanishingly small noise we know
from eqn(6) that Liouville equation feels the presence of a thermal bath with temperature β−1. In the present case
this eﬀect is to be replaced by a ”vacuum temperature” proportional to λ−1. Thus we insert a additional gaussian
term in the perturbation series in order to regularize phase space reconstrution and to provide the appropriate thermal
bath eﬀect. More precisely we look for a general series solution of the type

Before discussing solutions of the above set of equations note that a naive interpretation can be given to some of

any pair of Hilbert space vectors. However it is a necessary condition suggesting that this operator admits a Hermitian

becomes closed. The second equation is similar to the Ehrenfest theorem and the third one indicates together with
eqn(7) that the rise in total particle’s energy comes from its kinetic component. It’s worthwhile note that the ﬁrst
two equations are independent of noise intensity so concerning the non-stochastic limit their validity has the same
status as the Liouville equation. In the next step we look for a ﬁeld equation for Ψ. Deﬁne L

We have found that ﬁeld equation for the probability amplitude Ψ (x, t) follows quantum dynamics although the
formalism used in this work be classical. This classical signature of Stochastic Mechanics as presented here is not only

gives a maximum possible information in phase space through a true independence between position and momentum
variables that is not present in Quantum Theory.

But the above results show also that we have a disagreement between both theories. Remember that Wigner
function in phase space satisﬁes Liouville equation only approximately [15] whereas our probability density satisfy

shown in eqn (25). This conclusively shows that Wigner function W (x, p, t) and Φ (x, p, t) are not equal.

Having the terms in the perturbative series next step is phase space reconstruction. This task is not trivial because
involves the whole series above displayed but if momentum of the mechanical system under study is much larger than
~/λ the gaussian weight may induce a strong convergence in the perturbative series and truncation has some
pvac
sense. Thus we expect rapid convergence for suﬃciently high energy of the mechanical system compared to the mean

The above result shows that as an approximation, negative phase space probability also exist in our theory as it
happens with Wigner function in Quantum Mechanics. Of course exact probability distribution should be non-
negative and depends on calculation of all terms in the series for χ. It may happens that covergence be not uniform
a fact that complicate experimental veriﬁcation since an oscilating series presents intrinsic measurements diﬁculties.
Interestingly more, a new eﬀect rises out from eqn(26) as shown in its exponential prefactor where a low energy
phenomena controll a high energy cutoﬀ in phase space, being this a solution somewhat diﬀerent from those usually
found to eliminate ultraviolet divergences in ﬁeld theory. Even though of fundamental importance this eﬀect will not
considered here for further discussions.

C. Concluding Remarks

In this work a non-dissipative Brownian motion was considered and a perturbative series for the associated Fokker-
Planck equation presented. Noise source was assumed to be vacuum ﬂuctuations of some quantum ﬁeld that couples
to particle’s classical dynamics. Surprisingly the ﬁrst two terms of this series accommodates quantum dynamics
quite naturally with properties and structure of its Hilbert space stuﬀ. Nevertheless our approach is purely classical,
explicit in the physical meaning of all mathematical objects treated here. Moreover our probability density function
and Wigner function diﬀer suggesting that both theories can be compared at a experimental level specially if phase
space tomography measurements [14] with massive particles becomes eﬀectiveness.

In one line of reasoning this may indicate that our approach do not describe a truly quantal phenomena since
a disagreement with Wigner function occur. But an alternative way may be given. Wigner function was originally
constructed as a mathematical object without any explicit classical equivalence in what concern its (classically-deﬁned)
measurement. Its simultaneous dependence on position and momentum variables indicates it lives naturally in phase
space. In addition it also satisﬁes approximately Liouville equation but since it can present negative values no support
exists for an interpretation it is the quantum version of phase space probability density function.

Quite diﬀerently, in the formalism presented here phase space dynamics is real by construction and the interpretation
of all mathematical objects are philosophically self-consistent since they satisfy all paradigms of Classical Mechanics
reasoning. Even the probability waves and the associated wavelengths y have clear physical meaning. In addition
phase space reconstruction shown in eqn(26) presents in its lower order expansion negative probability values thus
disclaiming the interpretation where this phenomenon is a mark of the Quantum Theory. In fact it is known from
long that small noise perturbation series of the FPE may present negative terms [7]. These considerations demands
that experiment should deﬁnitively test whether dynamics in phase space as presented in this work is correct or not.
The most serious objection against the formulation of Stochastic Mechanics we present is probably the possibility of
a material body gain some energy from vacuum. This reasoning breaks the naive classical paradigms we claim to give
to the rest of the theory. It is the price paid for get so smoothly quantum dynamics from a purely classical theory. We
have argued that although vacuum power seems unphysical at ﬁrst sight may in fact be a real phenomenon with true
detection chance. If real is reasonable think that dynamcs of elementary particles are then correctly described by an
appropriate FPE as discussed here. Vacuum temperature must be so small that usual quantum phenomena behave
like high temperature ones and this in our interpretation means that typical wavelengths of the probability density
are much smaller than vacuum wavelength so the whole perturbation series can be approximated by its stationary
Liouville solution. Consequently important quantum results like atomic spectra can be understood inside our classical

reasoning. Moreover our formalism open tips to think about experimental detection of alternative theories that not
only embraces Quantum Mechanics as well test its foundations at a more precise level. These considerations are, in
our assessment, suﬃcient to take account in serious way the possibility that non-dissipative Brownian motion driven
by vacuum ﬂuctuations be a real phenomena turning out Stochastic Mechanics a faithful description of Nature.

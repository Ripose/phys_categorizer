Abstract

In this paper we analyze the dynamic stability of the hovering
magnetic top from ﬁrst principles without using any preliminary as-
sumptions. We write down the equations of motion for all six degrees
of freedom and solve them analytically around the equilibrium solu-
tion. Using this solution we then ﬁnd conditions which the height of
the hovering top above the base, its total mass, and its spinning speed
have to satisfy for stable hovering.

The calculation presented in this paper can be used as a guide to

the analysis and synthesis of magnetic traps for neutral particles.

1 Introduction

1.1 The hovering magnetic top.

The hovering magnetic top is an ingenious device that hovers in mid-air while
spinning. It is marketed as a kit in the U.S.A. and Europe under the trade
name LevitronTM [1, 2] and in Japan under the trade name U-CAS[3].
The whole kit consists of three main parts: A magnetized top which weighs
about 18gr, a thin (lifting) plastic plate and a magnetized square base plate
(base). To operate the top one should set it spinning on the plastic plate
that covers the base. The plastic plate is then raised slowly with the top
until a point is reached in which the top leaves the plate and spins in mid-
air above the base for about 2 minutes. The hovering height of the top is
approximately 3cm above the surface of the base whose dimensions are about
10cm×10cm×2cm. The kit comes with extra brass and plastic ﬁne tuning
weights, as the apparatus is very sensitive to the weight of the top. It also
comes with two wedges to balance the base horizontally.

1.2 Qualitative Description.

The physical principle underlying the operation of the hovering magnetic top
relies on the so-called ‘adiabatic approximation’ [4, 5, 6, 7]: As the top is
launched, its magnetization points antiparallel to the magnetization of the
base in order to supply the repulsive magnetic force which will act against the
gravitational pull. As the top hovers, it experiences lateral oscillations which
are slow ( Ωlateral ≃ 1Hz) compared to its precession (Ωprecession ∼ 5Hz).
The latter, itself, is small compared to the top’s spin (Ωspin ∼ 25Hz). Since
Ωspin ≫ Ωprecession the top is considered ‘fast’ and acts like a classical
spin. Furthermore, as Ωprecession ≫ Ωlateral this spin may be considered
as experiencing a slowly rotating magnetic ﬁeld. Under these circumstances
the spin precesses around the local direction of the ﬁeld (adiabatic approx-
imation) and, on the average, its magnetization µ points antiparallel to the
local magnetic ﬁeld lines. In view of this discussion, the magnetic interac-
tion energy which is normally given by −µ · H is now given approximately
by µ |H|. Thus, the overall eﬀective energy seen by the top is

Eeﬀ ≃ mgz + µ |H| .

By virtue of the adiabatic approximation, two of the three rotational degrees
of freedom are coupled to the transverse translational degrees of freedom,
and as a result the rotation of the axis of the top is already incorporated in
Eq.(1). Thus, under the adiabatic approximation, the top may be considered
as a point-like particle whose only degrees of freedom are translational. The
important point of this discussion is the following: The energy expression
written above possesses a minimum for certain values of µ/m. Thus, when
the mass is properly tuned, the apparatus acts as a trap, and stable hovering
becomes possible.

As mentioned above, the adiabatic approximation holds whenever Ωspin ≫
Ωprecession and Ωprecession ≫ Ωlateral. As Ωprecession is inversely pro-
portional to Ωspin, these two inequalities can be satisﬁed simultaneously pro-
vided that the top is spun fast enough, to get Ωspin ≫ Ωprecession, but not
too fast, for then Ωprecession > Ωlateral!. The reason for the lower bound on
the spin is obvious: If the top is spun too slowly, then Ωspin . Ωprecession
and the top becomes unstable against rotations. The top will then ﬂip over
and will be pulled quickly to the base. This is the instability that is well
known from classical top physics[11, 12]. The reason for an upper bound
on the spin is quite diﬀerent: If the top is spun too fast, the axis of the
top becomes too rigid and cannot respond fast enough to the changes of the
direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. It is then considered as ﬁxed in space and,
according to Earnshaw’s theorem[10] , becomes unstable against translations.

1.3 The purpose and structure of this paper.

The major problem with the adiabatic approximation is that it cannot predict
exactly the allowed range of Ωspin for which stable hovering occurs. It simply
gives us estimates for this range, and for design purposes this may not be
enough. The purpose of this paper is to give a quantitative description
of the physics of the hovering magnetic top while it is in mid-air without
using any preliminary assumptions (such as the adiabatic approximation).
To do this, we ﬁrst expand the magnetic ﬁeld around the equilibrium point
to second order in the spatial coordinates. Using the gradients of this ﬁeld
we then ﬁnd the force and torque on the top and write down the equations of
motion for all 6 degrees of freedom in vectorial form[8]. Next, we solve these
equations for the stationary solution and for a small perturbation around
this stationary solution and arrive at a secular equation for the frequencies

3

of the various possible modes. The possible eigenmodes are either oscillatory
(corresponding to stable solution) or exponential (unstable solution). The
secular equation comes out linear in Ωspin, and it is not diﬃcult to write
analytic expressions for the upper and lower bounds of Ωspin.

The structure of this paper is as follows: In Sec.2 we ﬁrst describe our
model and deﬁne our notations. Next, we derive the equations of motion
for the translational and rotational degrees of freedom, and ﬁnally we solve
these equations around the equilibrium position. In Sec.3 we apply our results
to the case of a disk-like top of radius a = 0.25R hovering above a circular
current loop of radius R. We ﬁx the equilibrium hovering height and plot the
various frequencies of the stable modes as a function of Ωspin. We identify the
origin of the various modes and comment on the way these modes are coupled
to produce the minimum and maximum speeds at which the system becomes
In particular the connection of these results with the adiabatic
unstable.
approximation will be discussed. Then we change the equilibrium height
and note how the allowed range of Ωspin is aﬀected. We shall show that
above a particular height, where according to the adiabatic approximation
hovering is not possible, hovering is still possible in a certain range, and
that, furthermore, the lower bound on Ωspin originates from a new mode
coupling, not predicted by the adiabatic approximation. In the last section
we summarize our results and discuss the possible uses of the derivation
presented in this paper to the study of magnetic traps for neutral particle.

2 Derivation and Solution of the Equations

of Motion.

2.1 Description of the model and notation.

In this paper we analyze the dynamics of the top while in mid-air as is shown
in Fig.1. We consider a symmetric top with mass m and a magnetic moment
µ, rotating about its principal axis with angular speed Ωs. The magnetic
moment of the top is assumed to be concentrated at the center of gravity
of the top and to point along the symmetry axis of the top. The latter is
denoted by the unit vector ˆn. The moment of inertia of the top about ˆn is
I3 whereas the secondary moment of inertia is I1.

The spatial position of the top is given with respect to its equilibrium

4

position (point Q in the ﬁgure). Thus, z is the vertical displacement of the
top and ρ is its radial displacement. We denote by ˆz and ˆρ the unit vectors
in the vertical and radial direction, respectively.

Though this is not mandatory for our calculations, we assume for sim-
plicity, that the magnetic ﬁeld possesses cylindrical symmetry around the
vertical axis.
In addition, the direction of gravity is assumed to coincide
with the symmetry axis of the magnetic ﬁeld and to point downward. We
denote by g the free fall acceleration.

2.2 The equations of motion.

As the symmetry axis of the magnetic ﬁeld coincides with the direction of
gravity, equilibrium is possible only along this axis. We therefore express the
magnetic ﬁeld, to second order in ρ and z, at the vicinity of the equilibrium
position in terms of its derivatives along the ˆz direction at the equilibrium
position. This is possible due to cylindrical symmetry and to the fact that
the Cartesian components of the ﬁeld are harmonics. The result is

Here H, H ′ and H ′′ are the vertical magnetic ﬁeld, its ﬁrst and second

i.e. at point Q.

energy of a dipole with a ﬁeld plus a gravitational term, i.e.

E = −µˆn · H (ρ, z) + mgz.

Consequently the force on the top is

F = −∇E = µ∇ (ˆn · H) − mgˆz,

whereas the torque is

T = µˆn × H.

The equation for r =ρˆρ+zˆz, the radius vector of the center of mass of the

top with respect to point Q, is given by

To write a vectorial equation of motion (see for example [9]) for the an-
gular momentum, L , we note that it has two components in perpendicular
directions. The ﬁrst component is due to the rotation of the top around
the ˆn direction and is given simply by Ln = I3Ωsˆn. The second component
of the angular momentum is contributed by the change in the direction of
the principal axis from ˆn to ˆn+dˆn. Since, by deﬁnition, ˆn is a unit vector,
it must point perpendicular to dˆn. Thus, Ω⊥ = |dˆn/dt| is the angular ve-
locity associated with the change of ˆn. Since the direction of Ω⊥ must be
perpendicular to both dˆn and ˆn we form the cross product Ω⊥ = ˆn× (dˆn/dt)
which incorporates both the correct value and the right direction. Multiply-
ing Ω⊥ by I1 yields the second component of the orbital angular momentum,
L⊥ = I1ˆn× (dˆn/dt). Thus, L = Ln + L⊥ = I3Ωsˆn+I1ˆn × (dˆn/dt). Using this
expression together with Eq.(4) for the torque we ﬁnd that the equation of
motion for the angular momentum is

Eqs.5,6 together form a coupled system of equations for all 6 degrees of
freedom of the top. In these equations r, ˆn and Ωs are the dynamical variables
(a total of 6 degrees of freedom), H is the magnetic ﬁeld which itself is a
function of r, whereas m, µ, I1 and I3 are external parameters.

2.3 Solution for the equations of motion

The stationary solution of the problem is obvious: When the top is on the
symmetry axis with its principal axis parallel to the ˆz axis, two forces act
on the top. The ﬁrst force is the downward gravitational force mg and the
second one is the upward magnetic force supplied by the external magnetic
ﬁeld, i.e., µH ′. Since these forces are colinear, no torque is exerted. We
therefore look for a solution of the form

ρ(t) = z(t) = 0
ˆn(t) = ˆz
Ωs(t) = Ωs = Const.

(7)

Inserting this solution into Eqs.5,6 yields identities for 5 degrees of free-
dom. The equation for z, on the other hand, gives the expected equilibrium

6

condition

µH ′ = mg.

To investigate the stability of the stationary solution, we now add ﬁrst
order perturbations to the equations of motion. Thus, we make the following
substitutions

where, since ˆn is a unit vector, δˆn must be perpendicular to ˆz. Substituting
Eq.9 into Eqs.5,6 and expanding to ﬁrst order in the perturbations gives

z(t) → 0 + δz(t)
~ρ(t) → 0 + δ~ρ(t)
Ωs(t) → Ωs(t) + δΩ(t)
ˆn(t) → ˆz + δˆn(t)

We note that (at least to lowest order) the motions in the ˆz direction and
the rotation around the ˆn axis are decoupled from the other degrees of free-
dom. Furthermore, according to Eq.11 the motion in the ˆz-direction is stable
provided that H ′′ < 0. We now focus our attention on the remaining four de-
grees of freedom: Note that the right-hand side of Eq.10 contains two terms:
The ﬁrst is the adiabatic term which tends to stabilize the top against lateral
translations by tilting the axis of the top. The second term, which we call
Earnshaw’s term, tends to destabilize the top and to take it away from the
equilibrium position. Solving Eq.10 for δˆn and substituting it into Eq.13
results in a fourth order equation for the radius δ~ρ:

2mI1ˆz × δ~ρ(4) + 2mI3Ωsδ~ρ(3)+

The possible solutions of this equation are linear combinations of a steady
rotation of δ~ρ around ˆz at angular velocity ω (this is possible because of the
cylindrical symmetry of the ﬁeld; otherwise, one should write two equations
for the two components of δ~ρ). We thus set

This fourth-order equation for ω has four real roots (or eigenfrequencies)
whenever the system is stable. Since we are looking for the range of Ωs for
which the system is stable, we take another point of view and express Ωs in
terms of ω. The resulting equation after using mg = µH ′ is

3 Application to a disk-like top above a cir-

cular current loop.

As an example we now apply Eq.17 to the case of a disk-like top of radius
a. Consequently, I3 = ma2/2 and I1 = ma2/4. The source of the magnetic
ﬁeld is taken as a horizontal current loop (or alternatively, a vertically uni-
formly magnetized thin disk) of radius R. The vertical magnetic ﬁeld and its
derivatives along the axis at a height h above the loop are therefore given by

Note that the magnetic ﬁeld was chosen to point downward. Thus, in order to
get an upward repulsive magnetic force, the magnetic moment should point
upward. The sign convention is chosen such that h and µ are positive, H is
negative and, consequently, H ′ is positive. For stability in the z direction we
require H ′′ < 0. This occurs, according to Eq.18, as long as h > hmin = 0.5R,
and sets a lower bound for the height at which stable hovering is possible.
Taking h = 0.55R and a = 0.25R (these are approximately the parameters
for the Levitron) inside Eq.17 and plotting Ωs versus ω yields the solid line

there are four real solutions ω which correspond to four stable modes. The
frequency of the fastest mode goes asymptotically to the dotted line Ωs =
(I1/I3) ω as Ωs ≫ ω0. This is nothing but the ‘fast precession’ rotational
mode encountered in classical top physics[11]. The frequency of the next
fastest mode goes roughly like ω ≃ µH/I3Ωs (compare it to the dash-dash-
dotted line). This is the well known ‘slow precession’ rotational mode of a
classical top[11]. The coupling between these two modes produces the min-
imum speed for stability Ωs,min = 7.1
g/R. For comparison purposes we
have also included in our plot (dashed line) the resultant mode frequencies
when we set H ′ and H ′′ = 0 inside Eq.(16). This is equivalent to solving the
problem of a magnetized top, in a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld. In fact, these
mode frequencies may be obtained as the roots of Ωs = (I1/I3) ω + µH/I3ω.
The minimum value of this expression occurs for ω2 = µH/I1 and is given
by Ωs,min =
3 , which is the minimum speed of a classical top in a
homogeneous ﬁeld. By comparing the mode frequencies for the homogeneous
ﬁeld to the mode frequencies for the inhomogeneous ﬁeld we see that (as far
as the minimum speed is concerned) the minimum speed in both graphs is
almost the same. The two slowest modes in the solid-line plot are the two
vibrational modes of the top. It is clearly seen that one of them is strongly
coupled to the slow precession mode. This coupling is responsible for pro-
ducing the maximum speed for stability Ωs,max = 19.3
g/R, as was already
predicted by the adiabatic approximation. But unlike in the adiabatic ap-
proximation, we now have a way to ﬁnd analytically both the minimum and
maximum speed in a single stroke.

Our next step is to study how the allowed range of Ωs depends on the
equilibrium height h. In Fig.3 we have plotted the mode frequencies versus
Ωs for h = 0.55R, 0.6R, 0.6325R , 0.64R and 0.65R. In Fig.4 we have plotted
the minimum and maximum speeds for each equilibrium height starting at
h = 0.5R. Recall that stability along the ˆz direction requires that h > 0.5R.
Thus, the two curves plotted in Fig.4 together with the h = 0.5R line deﬁne
a closed region in the Ωs-h plane. Each point inside this region corresponds
to a stable hovering solution whereas each point outside this region belongs
to an unstable solution. From this ﬁgure we may deduce that the range of
heights for which stable hovering is possible is given by

0.5R ≤ h ≤ 0.658R

The ﬁgure also shows that as h increases above its minimum value hmin =
0.5R, the minimum allowed speed Ωs,min1 decreases slightly, whereas the
maximum allowed speed Ωs,max increases. As h increases further, the cou-
pling between the two vibrational modes becomes stronger, and when h ex-
2/5R, this coupling gives rise to the ap-
ceeds a ﬁrst critical value hc,1 =
pearance of a new minimum Ωs,min2 of Ωs (ω), which increases steeply with
increasing h. As the height exceeds the slightly larger value hc,2 = 0.634R,
this new minimum Ωs,min2 becomes higher than the minimum speed Ωs,min1
determined by the coupling between the rotational modes, and thus limits
the stability of the top.

q

At h = hc,3 = 0.658R, the minimum speed Ωs,min2(h) crosses the maxi-
mum speed Ωs,max(h), such that stable hovering is not possible for h > hc,3
and Ωs > Ωs,min2(hc,3).

It is important to note that the adiabatic approximation does not predict
this new coupling. According to the adiabatic approximation the system will
be stable against lateral translations whenever the curvature of the eﬀective
energy (given in Eq.1) along the ˆρ direction is positive. It can be shown that
this is satisﬁed whenever h <
2/5R. Thus, the adiabatic approximation

2/5R is not possible.

predicts that hovering above h =

calculation we ﬁnd, however, that the top is also stable above this height.

This is due to the splitting of the vibration degenracy by the coupling to
the precessional mode present when the spin is ﬁnite. This has already been
pointed out by M. V. Berry[5] who treated it in terms the phenomenon
of geometrical magnetism. Since each equilibrium height corresponds to a

10

diﬀerent repulsive magnetic force (and hence to a diﬀerent mass) we can,
alternatively, specify the allowed range of mass required for stable hovering
by using Eq.8 and Eq.18 (note that the maximum height corresponds to the
lightest mass and the minimum height corresponds to the heaviest mass).
The results are plotted in Fig. 5. From the ﬁgure we learn that, for a =
0.25R, the mass of the top must be such that

Experimentally the tolerance is only about 1% which seems like a large dis-
crepancy. Note, however, that the lower mass region (of less than 0.818m0) is
diﬃcult to access. Also, the top retains a ﬁnite kinetic energy when launched
into the trap which, as has been discussed by us[13], further decreases the
mass tolerance in practice. Last but not least, the theoretical mass tolerance,
given in Eq.(19) decreases drastically with the tilt of the base, and goes to
zero for a tilt of about 0.45 degrees. This, in turn, makes it diﬃcult to real-
ize, in practice, the above theoretical mass tolerance, even with the leveling
wedges supplied with the Levitron.

Note also that the temperature coeﬃcient of the magnetization of the
ceramic magnet from which the Levitron is made is about 0.2% per degree
Celsius. As the magnetic force varies with the square of the magnetization,
temperature changes may easily ‘throw’ the mass out of range.

To overcome these problems the kit comes with a set of light washers to

tune the mass properly.

4 Summary.

In this paper we have analyzed the hovering magnetic top while it is in mid-
air without using any preliminary assumptions. To do this we expanded the

11

magnetic ﬁeld around the equilibrium point to second order in the spatial
coordinates. Using the gradients of this ﬁeld we then found the force and
torque on the top and wrote down vectorial equations of motion for all 6
degrees of freedom. Next, we solved these equations analytically for the sta-
tionary solution and for a small perturbation around this stationary solution
and arrived at a secular equation for the frequencies of the various possible
modes. We then applied the solution to the case of a disk-like top hovering
above a circular current loop, and were able to predict both the minimum
and maximum allowed speeds for stable hovering to occur.

Although the numerical results we have presented in this paper refer to
the case of a disk-like top (I3/I1 = 2), our theory is valid for the whole
range of the anisotropy parameter I3/I1 of the symmetric top, and is there-
fore more general than the model studied in Ref.[8] who approximated the
top by a classical spin. We recover their results by setting I1 = 0 in our
calculations[14]. Also, our analysis yields naturally the minimum spin for
stability, which is zero for the I1 = 0 case, and thus is put in ‘by hand’
in the previous [8] treatment. The determination of the maximum spin, as
a function of the anisotropy parameter I3/I1, is of particular interest for
cigar-like tops (I3/I1 < 1), as for such tops the minimum speed behaves
drastically diﬀerent than for disk-like tops (2 > I3/I1 > 1), as we have shown
elsewhere[15, 16].

An interesting corollary of our analysis is a limitation on the radius of
the disk-like top. One would have expected that increasing the radius of
the top will facilitate the operation of the Levitron as the moment of inertia
increases, thus reducing the minimum speed. However, the maximum speed
decreases faster when the radius increases, with the result that

Thus, the top cannot exceed two thirds of the base. Another detrimental
eﬀect of increasing the radius is the reduction of the hovering time[17] due
to the increased eﬀect of air friction. Moreover, air friction also modiﬁes
the stability analysis: So far we carried out a detailed study of the eﬀect of
friction on stability only for the I1 = 0 model. In this case we found[16] that
with friction the top is always unstable even if the friction is inﬁnitesimaly
small and even if we invoke translational viscosity only. We expect this

behavior to occur also for I1 6= 0 indicating that spin traps are diﬀerent in
character from potential traps in which friction ‘increases’ stability.

We have disregarded here the angular momentum carried by the electrons
responsible for the ferromagnetic moment of the top. Although this is very
small compared to the orbital angular momentum of the Levitron, the two
angular momenta may become comparable for suﬃciently small tops, which
would result in a left-right asymmetry. Furthermore, the possibility of levi-
tation based only on the electronic angular momentum arises. This will be
discussed elsewhere[16].

Also, our treatment is completely classical. As size decreases, quantum-
mechanical eﬀects may become important. In particular, a suﬃciently small
particle, for example an atom, will only have a ﬁnite life-time in the trap due
to quantum-mechanical eﬀects, which will be considered elsewhere[16].

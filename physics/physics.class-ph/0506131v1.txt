ABSTRACT: Constitutive scalars that are absent in the fundamental diﬀerential equations of
frequency–domain electromagnetism on the two sides of a boundary between two homogeneous
mediums are shown to disappear from the boundary conditions as well.

1

Introduction

Modern macroscopic electromagnetism employs four diﬀerential equations containing four vec-
tor ﬁelds, a source charge density, and a source current density. Two of the four ﬁelds (i.e.,
˜E (x, t) and ˜B (x, t)) are primitive ﬁelds, while the remaining two (i.e., ˜D (x, t) and ˜H (x, t))
are induction ﬁelds. Unlike the primitive ﬁelds, the induction ﬁelds do not have microscopic
existence and are not considered fundamental but undoubtedly oﬀer a great deal of convenience
[1, 2].

From the four diﬀerential equations emerge four boundary conditions or jump conditions,
by employing well–known constructions involving pillboxes and contours [3, 4]. This commu-
nication arose from an examination of the piecewise uniqueness of the induction ﬁeld phasors
and the consequences for boundary conditions in macroscopic frequency–domain electromag-
netism. It provides a negative answer to the following question: Can constitutive scalars that
are absent in the fundamental diﬀerential equations on the two sides of a boundary between
two homogeneous mediums appear in the boundary conditions?

2 The question

Let us consider all space to be divided into two distinct regions, V+ and V−, separated by a
boundary S. The sources of the electromagnetic ﬁeld are located in V+ suﬃciently far away
from S, whereas our analysis concerns the immediate vicinity of S on both sides. Both regions
are ﬁlled with diﬀerent spatially homogeneous and temporally invariant mediums.

The frequency–domain Maxwell equations

are applicable in both V+ and V−, with i = √

the temporal Fourier transform of ˜B (x, t), etc. The remaining two frequency–domain Maxwell
equations in V+ may be written as

where ρso and J so (x, ω) are the source densities. In the region V−, the corresponding equations

etc. The boundary conditions (4)1 and (4)2 involve the primitive ﬁeld phasors, whereas (4)3 and
(4)4 involve the induction ﬁeld phasors. We have also taken note of the location of the source
densities chosen as not being in the vicinity of S.

The terms on the right sides of (5)1 and (5)2 are mutually exclusive. Whereas A (x, ω) and
φ (x, ω) are some ﬁelds that are not necessarily electromagnetic, the six scalars α±(ω), etc., are
uniform in the respective regions and may be considered as constitutive scalars.

A blind application of the boundary conditions (4)3 and (4)4 would involve all six constitutive

scalars appearing on the right sides of (5)1 and (5)2. Would that be correct?

3 The answer

Boundary conditions in electromagnetism are not externally imposed but instead emerge from
the fundamental diﬀerential equations [5]. Therefore, in order to answer the question posed in
the previous section, let us ﬁrst substitute (5) in (2) and (3). The resulting diﬀerential equations
are as follows:

• Da (x, ω) = ρso (x, ω)

H a (x, ω) + iωDa (x, ω) = J so (x, ω) )

The following correct boundary conditions emerge from the application of the standard tech-

Let us note that these boundary conditions do not involve the six constitutive scalars α±(ω),
β±(ω), and γ±(ω), which are also absent from the fundamental equations (1), (6), and (7).
These constitutive scalars can therefore be safely set to zero without aﬀecting macroscopic
electromagnetism.

4 Concluding remarks

The foregoing exercise shows that constitutive scalars that are absent in the fundamental diﬀer-
ential equations of frequency–domain electromagnetism on the two sides of a boundary between
two homogeneous mediums cannot appear in the boundary conditions. If wrongly allowed to
appear by virtue of a blind application of the standard boundary conditions, these constitutive
scalars would lead to wrong conclusions from the solutions of boundary value problems.

In other words, the Maxwell equations act like ﬁlters of constitutive terms, and a constitutive

terms ﬁltered out of the Maxwell equations is also ﬁltered out of the boundary conditions.

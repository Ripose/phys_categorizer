It is shown that for a central potential that is an injective function of the radial coordinate, a

second central potential can be found that leads to trajectories in the conﬁguration space and

the momentum space coinciding, respectively, with the trajectories in the momentum space and

the conﬁguration space produced by the original potential.

Keywords: Hamiltonian mechanics; classical mechanics

1. Introduction

In most examples of classical mechanics, the potential energy is a function of the coordinates

only; however, such a potential determines the orbit of the mechanical system in conﬁguration

space and also the evolution of the momenta of the particles of the system. For example,

1

the central potential V (r) = −k/r (which corresponds to the so-called Kepler problem) leads

to orbits in conﬁguration space that are conics and the trajectory in momentum space (the

hodograph) is (part of) a circle (see, e.g., Refs. 1–3). Then, one may ask if there exists a potential

that leads to orbits in the conﬁguration space that are (part of) circles and the hodograph is a

conic.

The aim of this paper is to show that, in some cases, for a given potential one can ﬁnd a

second potential (which will be referred to as the mirror potential), depending on the coordinates

only, such that the trajectories in conﬁguration space and in momentum space produced by the

mirror potential coincide with the trajectories in momentum space and conﬁguration space,

respectively, corresponding to the original potential. Our discussion will be restricted to central

potentials and we shall show that the mirror potential can be constructed whenever the original

potential is an injective function of the radial distance.

The existence of the mirror potential is not a trivial matter. In fact, not every system of

ordinary diﬀerential equations can be expressed in the form of the Lagrange equations (see, e.g.,

Ref. 4 and the references cited therein). As we shall show below, with the replacement of the

original potential by the mirror potential, it is necessary to change the time parametrization

[see Eq. (8)]. The use of the Hamiltonian formulation simpliﬁes the derivation enormously.

2. Mirror potentials

We shall consider a particle subjected to a central potential V (r); its Hamiltonian function,

expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates, can be taken as

H =

1
2m

(p

2
x + p

2
y + p

2
z) + V

x2 + y2 + z2

.

(cid:18)q

(cid:19)

(1)

(This expression for the Hamiltonian is the standard one, but there exist many other choices,

see, e.g., Ref. 5.)

The equations of motion are given by the Hamilton equations

dqi
dt

=

∂H
∂pi

,

dpi
dt

= −

∂H
∂qi ,

and, if we interchange the coordinates and momenta in Eq. (1), reversing the sign of the resulting

expression we obtain a new Hamiltonian

H, which, by means of the Hamilton equations, will

lead to the trajectories in conﬁguration and momentum spaces deﬁned by H, interchanged. In

e

into the Hamilton equations yields the same equations of motion as H but with the coordinates

and momenta interchanged.

Since we are assuming that V does not depend on the time, the evolution of the state of the

system in the phase space is a curve lying on a hypersurface

H = −E, where E is some real

constant (the minus sign is introduced for convenience). From the condition

H = −E, making

e

use of Eq. (2) we then obtain,

where F denotes the inverse function of V , whose existence requires that V (r) be an injective

function. The last equation can also be written as

which is a relation of the form h = const., with

h ≡

(cid:19)(cid:21)

and h is now a Hamiltonian function corresponding to a central potential

that depends parametrically on E.

For instance, if V (r) = −k/r, where k is a constant, then F (r) = −k/r and, owing to Eq.

(5), the corresponding mirror potential is given by

v(r) ≡ −

v(r) = −

.

According to the discussion above, this potential leads to orbits in conﬁguration space that

are (arcs of) circles and the orbits in momentum space are conics. In fact, if we consider the

Hamiltonian with the mirror potential (6) (expressed in polar coordinates, making use of the

fact that, for a central potential, the orbit lies on a plane)

taking h = 0 as above and using the conservation of pθ we have

where L is a constant. Then, the chain rule gives

and therefore

The solution of this last equation corresponds to a circle of radius |mk/L| whose center is at a

distance

(mk/L)2 + 2mE from the origin.

The proof that in all cases h yields the same trajectories as

H can be given as follows. From

In a similar way, one obtains ∂h/∂pi = dqi/dτ . That is, the trajectories generated by h coincide

with those generated by

H but have a diﬀerent parametrization (see also Refs. 6,7).

It may be remarked that the Cartesian coordinates are not essential in the construction of

e

the mirror potential given above; in fact, in the derivation of Eqs. (7) only the central character

of the potential was required.

Another simple example is given by V (r) =

1
2 kr2 (corresponding to an isotropic harmonic

oscillator); in this case F (r) = (2r/k)1/2 and therefore the mirror potential is

which is essentially the original potential, and this corresponds to the fact that, for an isotropic

harmonic oscillator, the trajectories in conﬁguration space and in the momentum space are both

ellipses. By contrast with the potential (6), the potential (9) only contains the parameter E in

an additive constant that has no eﬀect in the equations of motion. Furthermore, in this case,

τ = −mkt + const.

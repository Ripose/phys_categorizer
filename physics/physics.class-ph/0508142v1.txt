Abstract. The chaotic behaviour of the motion of the planets in our Solar System is well established. Numerical
experiments with a modiﬁed Solar System consisting of a more massive Earth have shown, that for special values
of an enlargement factor κ around 5 the dynamical state of a truncated planetary system (excluding Mercury
and the outer planets Uranus and Neptune) is highly chaotic. On the contrary for values of the mass of the Earth
up to the mass of Saturn no irregular dynamical behaviour was observed. We extended our investigations to the
complete planetary system and showed, that this chaotic window found before still exists. Tests in diﬀerent ’Solar
Systems’ showed that only including Jupiter and Saturn with their actual masses together with a ’massive’ Earth
(between 4 and 6 times more massive) destabilize the orbit of Mars so that even escapes from the system are
possible.

Key words. Solar System – enlarged Earth – Mars escapes

1. Introduction

In previous work we studied in detail how our planets
would evolve when their masses would be diﬀerent from
those which they have nowadays. The primary goal was
there to study the stability of the systems with regard
to their masses without changing the actual distribution
of the orbital elements of the planets. Such systems may
serve as models for exoplanetary systems with a compa-
rable distribution of the semimajor axes, relatively small
eccentricities and two dominating masses like Jupiter and
Saturn. Additionally it can be shown with this kind of
research how terrestrial like planets would dynamically
evolve in such systems. In a ﬁrst experiment (Dvorak and
S¨uli, 2002 =paper I) we uniformely enlarged the masses of
the three terrestrial planets Venus, Earth and Mars and
took as a dynamical model the truncated Solar system
from the planets Venus to Saturn (=Ve2Sa). It turned
out that the system itself remained in a dynamically sta-
ble state for enlargement factors up to more than 200. We
then started to enlarge the masses of the inner planets
separately (Dvorak et al, 2005 = paper II and S¨uli et al,
2005 = paper III) again in the model Ve2Sa and found es-
pecially interesting results for the case when we just took
a larger mass for the Earth. It turned out that the new
system under consideration is stable (with quasiperiodic
motions of the planets) up to quite a large mass of the
Earth, namely comparable to the one of Saturn. We found

a surprising exception: around κE = 5 in all our compu-
tations the ’new’ Solar System is in a highly chaotic state
with Mars suﬀering from large eccentricties and even from
escapes. In continuation of this work the interesting dy-
namical behaviour is now studied in a complete planetary
system including also Mercury and the outer ice giants
Uranus and Neptune.

2. Methods of investigation

As has been shown in many diﬀerent studies the use of
long term integration of the motions in the planetary sys-
tem gives reliable results up to at least several hundred
millions of years for a qualitative study of the orbits (e.g.
Ito and Tanikawa, 2002). This means that we have a good
knowledge of the semimajor axis, the eccentricities and
the inclinations of the orbits of the planets involved. On
a long term scale the motions of the planets are chaotic
which was shown by diﬀerent authors (e.g. Laskar, 1988
and 1996, Murray and Holman, 1999, Lecar et al, 2001).
But from these results we cannot conclude that the system
is unstable!

For our new investigation we used a program already
used (and tested) in many other applications of orbit dy-
namics, namely the Lie-integration (e.g. Dvorak et al,
2003, Asghari et al, 2004). The method is based on the in-
tegration of diﬀerential equations with Lie-series and uses
the property of recurrence formulae for the Lie-terms. This
quite accurate method has an automatic step size con-
trol which makes it fast also for eccentric orbits because

no additional computations are necessary to accomplish
(in contrary to symplectic methods). The details of the
method are described in Hanslmeier and Dvorak (1984),
Lichtenegger (1984) and Delva (1985). During the long
term integrations we checked the evolution of the action
like elements, which – in case of a chaotic orbit – shows
quite an irregular behaviour of the eccentricities and incli-
nations and also shows small jumps in the semimajor axis.
Finally in many cases we found is a ’quasiescape’1 of the
planet with the smallest mass. What we were interested in
is to investigate more in detail the dynamical behaviour of
a ’Solar-like’ planetary system (with all terrestrial planets
and the gas and ice giants) when we increase the mass of
the Earth with a factor κ between 4 and 6.

3. The two dynamical models Ve2Sa and Me2Ne

First we have undertaken computations in diﬀerent dy-
namical models inside this ’chaotic window’: in the trun-
cated models Ve2Ju, Ve2Ma and Ea2Ma the motion
of Mars did not show any signs of chaos when we used
4 < κ < 6 as massfactor for the Earth. It therefore seems
clear that the couple of Jupiter-Saturn (present in the
model Ve2Sa) is – together with the more massive Earth
– responsable for the escapes of Mars.

It was not expected that the inclusion of Mercury and
also of Uranus and Neptune would signiﬁcantly change the
dynamics. In fact the comparison of the complete model
Me2Ne with Ve2Sa does not unveil new features of the
dynamics of the system. Nevertheless the dynamical evo-
lution for the speciﬁc value of κE = 4.7 – chosen just as
one out of several others in this window – showed some
interesting details which will be discussed below.

3.1. The ’truncated’ planetary system

In Fig. 1 (upper panel) we can see a kind of irregular
variations in the semimajor axis; they go together with
large values of the eccentricities (middle panel). During
these phases the inclination (lower panel) is always rela-
tively small. On the contrary when the inclination is large
the variations in eccentricity as the value itself is rela-
tively small. In Fig. 2 the semimajor axis, the perihelion
and aphelion distances of Mars together with the respec-
tive orbital elements of the Earth are plotted. As one can
see the two orbits are still far from intersection, neverthe-
less whenever Mars comes close to the Earth these kind
of ’punches’ act as larger perturbations on its semimajor
axis.

In Fig. 3 we see the results of a continuation of the
computations shown above up to the moment when the
eccentricities of the orbit of Mars reaches values of 0.8
after 54 Myrs.

3.2. The complete system

In Fig. 4 (top graph) one can observe a small increase
(jump) in the semimajor axis already after almost 4 mil-
lion years (because of the diﬀerence in the y-scale com-
pared to Fig. 1 it is not well visible but it is present!)
together with an increase in eccentricity. From the same
moment on the inclination (bottom graph) stays in a mode
of only small irregular changes up to the end of integra-
tion of 10 million years. Large irregular variations on a
high mean value of e=0.35 after 8 million years lead to
strong variations in the semimajor axis (1.51 < a < 1.57)

4. Determination of fundamental frequencies

For a possible explanation of the strong chaotic behaviour
of the system for special values of κ we have applied
the ﬁrst order secular theory of Laplace-Lagrange. It
can be used when the eccentricities and inclinations can
be regarded as small quantities and the orbits are not
crossing. It is also important – for any perturbation
treatment of the motion of the planets – that the masses
involved are small with respect to the primary body,
which is for sure the case even with a ﬁve times more
massive Earth (still much smaller than the gasgiants).

of Mars. In Fig. 5 (upper graph) this dynamical behaviour
is well explained when we see that the aphelion distances
of the Earth and the perihelion distance of Mars intersect
after nine million of years of evolution. After nine million
years again one can see an increase going together with
the crossing of the orbits of Mars and the Earth. In the
same Fig. 5 (lower graph) one can see that also Venus is
suﬀering from an increase in the eccentricity. It is evident
that Mercury seemingly does not play any important role
in the dynamical evolution during these ﬁrst ten million
years (lower graph in Fig.5). In both models discussed the
motion of the outer planets did not show any visible dif-
ference compared to the actual Solar System.

unexpected strong chaotic behaviour we tested diﬀerent
models. It turned out that only the couple Jupiter-Saturn
together with the Earth (with a larger mass) is the cause
for the subsequent escape of Mars. In the comparison of
the two models Ve2Sa with Me2Ne we see that there
is in principle no diﬀerence for the state of chaoticity of
the orbits: in both models Mars suﬀers sooner or later
from close approaches with the Earth because of the large
values of the eccentricity (Fig. 7). This is true for the
whole interval 4 < κE < 6 which we tested with a step of
∆κE = 0.1 for both models. On the contrary, with larger
values of κ up to the size of Saturn (κE = 100) a regu-
lar dynamical behaviour without such chaotic signs like
jumps in the semimajor axes of Mars and very irregular
change of the eccentricity and the inclination of Mars was
observed. This regular dynamical evolution can be seen
in the quasiperiodic behaviour of the inclinations of the
planets (Fig. 8). In the upper panel one can see the incli-
nations of Venus (Max(i)=6.o5) and Mars (Max(i)= 5o)
for the model Ve2Sa, in the lower panel the same quanti-
ties in the model Me2Ne. It is evident that qualitatively
both plots agree quite well. The ﬁrst quantitative diﬀer-
ences appear after 1 million years in the inclination of
Venus. The same overall behaviour can be observed for
the eccentricities (not shown). All these orbits are quite
stable! But why do we have strong chaos in this window of
κ which does not appear for larger values up to a mass fac-
tor which correspond to an Earth comparable to Jupiter?
We are still working on the answer for this unexpected
behaviour but wanted at any rate to report it!

To determine the secular frequencies as a function of
the mass factor, we have computed the gj(κE), fj(κE)
functions for κE ∈ [4, 6] with the aid of the MAPLE al-
gebra manipulation package. The comparison of the re-
sults from our determination up to the ﬁrst order with
Bretagnon (1974 and 1982) and Kneˇzevi´c (1986) showed
satisfactory agreement for the model Me2Ne (with κ =
1). In Fig. 6 we compare the frequencies connected to
the planets Earth and Mars in the models Ve2Sa and
Me2Ne, which show only a slight shift: the minimum
distance is 0.1567 arcsec/year for κ ∼ 5.00 for Ve2Sa
respectively for Me2Ne 0.1538 arcsec/year for κ ∼ 5.20.

5. Discussion

In modelling extrasolar planetary systems we took our
own system as starting point for several models, where
we increased the masses of the planets involved until to
the moment of instability. In former papers it turned out
that only a signiﬁcant larger mass of the Earth (the other
planets’ masses were left unchanged) could lead to a de-
cay of these modiﬁed systems. Our report concentrates
on a surprising “chaotic window” in the dynamical evolu-
tion of our planetary system when we increase the mass
of the Earth by the massfactor 4 < κ < 6. Former re-
sults of paper III have unveiled this interesting but still
unexplained dynamical behaviour for a truncated Solar
system model (Ve2Sa). To ﬁnd out the reason for this

Abstract

The existence of radial solutions of a nonlinear Dirichlet problem in
a ball is translated to the language of Mechanics, i.e. to requirements
on the time of motion of a particle in an external potential and under
the action of a viscosity force. This approach reproduces existing
theorems and, in principle, provides a method for the analysis of the
general case. Examples of new theorems are given, which prove the
usefulness of this qualitative method.

1 Introduction

In the present paper, we consider the following nonlinear Dirichlet problem

∆u + f (u) = 0
u = 0

in Ω,
on

∂Ω,

(1)
(2)

D.
where f is a diﬀerentiable function and Ω is the ball of radius R in
We look for conditions guaranteing the existence of spherically symmetric
solutions to (1-2).

ℜ

The above mentioned problem has been extensively studied in the last
years (see, for example, [1-5] and references therein). In this paper, our pur-
pose is to develop a very simple picture, based on Mechanics, for the analysis
of the existence of solutions to (1-2). This qualitative picture reproduces
the existing results and, in principle, provides a frame for the analysis of
the radial solutions to (1 - 2) in presence of an arbitrary nonlinear function
f . Examples of new theorems are given, which show the usefulness of the
method.

To our knowledge, the analogy of the radial equation (1) with the Newto-
nian law of motion of a particle was ﬁrst used by Coleman [6] to obtain the
approximate form of the solution connecting false and true vacua in scalar
ﬁeld theories. This solution enters the semiclassical expresion for the decay
probability of the false vacuum state. Application of this analogy to the anal-
ysis of the existence of solitary waves in nonlinear one-dimensional media has
proven to be very useful too [7].

The plan of the paper is as follows. In the next Section, the problem about
the existence of solutions to (1-2) is translated to the language of Mechan-
ics. Two limiting solvable cases, the one-dimensional problem and the linear
equation, are considered and a few general results are given. Let us stress
that the function f (u) is interpreted as the derivative of a potential, thus the
linear equation describes the motion in a quadratic potential. Section 3 deals
with potentials having a well around u = 0. The most interesting examples
studied in this Section are, in our opinion, the potentials with barriers. In
Section 4, we study the motion in a potential with a hill around u = 0. In
Section 5, we consider singular (ﬁnite and inﬁnite) potentials. Concluding
remarks are given at the end of the paper.

+ f (u) = 0,

u(R) = 0.

(4)

Written in this form, the analogy with Mechanics is evident. Equation
3 is nothing, but the Newton law for a particle of unit mass moving in a
potentialV which is the antiderivative of f , f (u) = dV /du, and under the
action of a viscosity force inversely proportional to time. The particle should
start with zero velocity from a position u(0) and arrive to u = 0 in a time R
(Fig. 1a).

We have drawn in Fig. 1b a generic positive solution to (3-4) for a given
V . In general, the particle will realize damped oscillations around the point
u = 0 (Fig. 2). Let Tn(u(0)) be the time the particle spends to reach the
point u = 0 n times starting from u(0). Thus, the existence of a solution to
(3-4) may be formulated in the following terms:

“In the potential V , there exists an u(0) and a positive integer, n, such

that Tn(u(0)) = R”

The interesting point is that in many cases we may perform simple es-
timates, based on physical principles, of the dependence Tn vs u(0) and,
consequently, we may give criteria for the existence of solutions to (3-4).

Let us ﬁrst study two limiting cases in which equation (3) may be solved

exactly. They will be very useful in the analysis below.

2.1 The one-dimensional (D = 1) problem

The D = 1 case is characterized by the absence of friction. Thus, the energy
E = (1/2)(du/dr)2+V (u) is conserved, dE/dr = 0, and the dependence r(u)
may be expressed in the form of an integral in each interval where du/dr does
not change sign,

For a given potential, the equation Tn = R may be explicitly written and
the existence of solutions to Problem (3 - 4) may be explicitly investigated.

2.2 Motion in a quadratic potential (The linear equa-

tion)

note that the main properties of the solution may be understood simply from
the invariance properties of Eq. (8).

2.3 Some useful results

In this Subsection, we derive a few general results following from the analogy
with Mechanics and classify the potentials to be studied.

In the presence of dissipation, the rate of change of the energy is written

as

i.e. u(r) is damped, as mentioned above. It means that E(u(0)) = V (u(0)) >
E(0) > V (0) = 0 (we have supposed that f is integrable, so that V (u) may

be deﬁned as

THEOREM (A necessary condition): If u(r) is a solution to (3 - 4) and

R

f is integrable, then u(0) is such that

f (x) dx > 0,

sign(f (u(0))) = sign(u(0)).

The last condition on the sign of f (u(0)) means that the particle shall
be pushed towards the origin at the initial position, u(0). Otherwise, it will
never move to the origing passing through u(0) because of the energy losses.
More sophisticated versions of this Theorem will be formulated below

when studying potentials with barriers.

A second important result concerns the retardation eﬀect of friction. Let
us suppose that the particle moves from ua to ub. The time it spends in this
motion may be written as

Finally, let us classify the potentials according to their properties in the
neighborhood of u = 0. In the present paper, we will study four classes of
potentials having diﬀerent behaviours in the vicinity of this point (Fig. 3):

ra is greater than the time the particle

positive (the necessary condition).

c) and d) correspond to singular potentials.

We will study below each class of potentials separately.

3 Wells around u = 0

A well is deﬁned as a region with only one local extremum, the minimum at
u = 0. In this Section, we study some examples of potentials having a well
around u = 0.

additionally, we will asume that the only zero of f is at u = 0. Then, we
have the following

THEOREM: If λ(0) < λ1 and λ(

least 2k + 1 solutions.

This Theorem was obtained in [5]. We will give a detailed proof of it by
means of our method as an illustration. For the incomming Theorems, the
proof will be shortened.

The statement is that the function Tn vs u(0) has the form depicted in
k, i.e. for each Tn there are two solutions.

Indeed, the very small amplitude motion is governed by the u

asymptotics of V . Tn depends very smoothly on u(0) in this region and
Tn ≥

T1 > R. The latter inequality comes from λ(0) < λ1.

On the other hand, the large amplitude motion is governed by the
asymptotics and, according to the inequality λ(

Tk < R. The point to clarify is why Tn for large u(0) is not aﬀected by the
small-u behaviour of V .

The answer is that, when u(0) is large, the time the particle spends to
move in the small-u region is negligible. This result comes from the scale

Thus, Problem (3 - 4) has 2k nontrivial solutions plus the trivial u = 0.

3.2 Potentials with barriers

In the previous Subsection, we assumed continuity of Tn vs u(0). However,
continuity is broken when V has local extrema, others than u = 0. The point
is that, as may be seen from Eq. 5 and the retardation Lemma of Section
2.3, the time the particle spends to move out of a local maximum tends to
inﬁnity when u(0) approaches the position of the maximum.

Then, let us ﬁrst suppose that f has a unique second zero at a point

a > 0. The following Theorem may be formulated

THEOREM. If λ(0) > λk and V

has at least k solutions with 0 < u(0) < a.

To prove it, we draw again the function Tn(u(0)), with 1

Note that it is diﬃcult to draw the dependence Tn vs u(0) for negative

much more.

THEOREM. If f has positive zeroes, the ﬁrst of which is at u = a, and

V (a) = V (b+) = V (b−). Dashed lines means that the curves are conditionally
drawn, while shadowed intervals of u(0) mean physically impossible initial
conditions.

The dependence T1 on u(0) when 0 < u(0) < a is the same as in the
previous Theorem. For very large positive u(0), T1 is determined by λ(
),
∞
i.e. T1|u(0)→∞ < Tk < R. On the other hand, because of energy losses, if
the particle starts from b+ it will not reach the origin. By continuity, there
exists c1 > b+ such that the particle arrives at a with zero velocity. This
corresponds to an inﬁnite T1. When u > c1 the particle reaches the origin
and the dependence T1(u(0)) is shown. Note that we can not say anything
about T1 for negative u(0). Thus, the equation T1 = R will have, at least,
two solutions.

Analog reasonings are used in the analysis of Tn, 1 < n

k. Cn is now
deﬁned such that when u(0) > cn the origin is reached n times. Note that
Tn(cn) =
and also that c1 = c2 < c3 = c4 < c5 . . .. On the l.h.s. of the
origin, we can deﬁne the points en < d < b−. d is such that when the particle
arrives to a it do so with zero velocity, while en is such that for u(0) < en,
the particle reaches the origin n times. Note that e2 = e3 > e4 = e5 > e6 . . ..
In other words, for each n there are 4 solutions. This proves the Theorem.

Notice that, unlike papers [1 - 5], we are able to indicate forbidden regions

PROOF. It is evident that the particle will reach the origin whatever the
initial position be. It can not stop in an intermediate point where the force
is not zero. Thus, the question is how long it takes to reach the origin and
what is the ﬁnal velocity.
If this time and the velocity are ﬁnite, we can
repeat the argument to conclude that u(r) will have inﬁnite zeroes.

We now study the motion in a potential like that one shown in Fig. 3 b.
For simplicity, we assume that V is quadratic near zero (λ(0) < 0) and also
quadratic at large values of u. No additional zeroes of f exist. Then one can
formulate the following

THEOREM. If λ(0) < 0 and λ(

large-u(0) behaviour of it is evident. The points b+ and b− are the zeroes of
V . The points cn and en are deﬁned as in the previous Section, i.e. starting
from the right of cn (the left of en) the particle may reach the origin n times.
Note that would it start from cn (en), then it would arrive to u = 0 with
zero velocity, i.e. Tn(cn) = Tn(en) =

5 Singular Potentials

The main property of the singular potentials, Figs. 3 c) and d), is that the
dV /du, at u = 0 is ill-deﬁned. So, the motion an interval of time after

the particle reaches the origin is not well deﬁned, and we can only analyse
the existence of positive solutions to (3 - 4).

The proof is trivial.

6 Concluding Remarks

In the present paper, we used the analogy of Eq. (3) with the second Newton’s
law in order to obtain existence theorems in Problem (3 - 4). Appart from
reproducing existing results, we give new examples of potentials (of f ) in
which it is relatively easy to analyse the existence of solutions.

We think that the given examples show that the method is general enough
to provide a ﬁrst insight to the problem for any reasonable function f . After
that, we may go further on in two ways:
i) Use more rigurous methods to
complete the proof and/or ii) Obtain numerical solutions to the equation.

In this letter, we describe a physical situation where the time-integral of the electric ﬁeld of an
electromagnetic wave packet is not zero. More speciﬁcally, we demonstrate that the non-oscillating
component of the Fourier spectrum, i.e. the component resulting from the Fourier transform of
the electric ﬁeld evaluated at ω = 0, can be associated to the area of an unipolar electromagnetic
pulse that travels in free space at the speed of light. This feature oﬀers the possibility for this ﬁeld
component to interact with matter over extended regions of space.

The numerical value obtained by the integration of the

electric ﬁeld of a wave packet from t =
∞
can be associated to the amplitude of the non-oscillating
component of the Fourier spectrum E(r, ω = 0), that is :

where E(r, t) is the electric ﬁeld vector and r is the posi-
tion in space. From a geometrical point of view, Eq. (1)
gives the area, or the temporal average, of the signal.
According to Kim et al. [1], E(r, ω = 0) corresponds to

is thus believed that for a wave packet of ﬁnite dimen-
sions propagating far from its source the integral given
at Eq. (1) must be zero everywhere in space. However,
we suspect that this interpretation is incorrect.

The main doubt we have with the widely accepted in-
terpretation of Kim et al. [1] concerns the fact that, in
free space, the electric ﬁeld vector is proportional to the
time derivative of the vector potential, i.e. E(r, t) =
∂ tA(r, t), where ∂ tA(r, t) = ∂A(r, t)/∂t [2]. Conse-

be zero for all r? Let us now push this analysis a little
further.

In principle, any electromagnetic waveform can be gen-
erated [2, 3]. For example, if an arbitrary current J(t)
circulates into a conducting wire, a wave packet whose
electric ﬁeld is proportional to the temporal variations
of the driving signal will be emitted. Assuming that the

center of such a wire (of ﬁnite length ∆l and radius a)
is located at the origin r = (0, 0, 0) of a set of cylindrical
coordinates r = (r, θ, z) with a uniform current ﬂowing
along the z-axis, the vector potential propagating at a
great distance from the source is written as follows [2] :

that the quantity within the brackets must be expressed
in terms of the retarded time tr = t
r/c, with c being
the speed of light in vacuo. Combining Eqs. (3) and (4),
we calculated the non-oscillating component of the ﬁeld
and we obtained this :

It thus appears that the time integral of the electric

this is what we expect to happens. However,
current ﬂuctuations are suﬃciently separated, the ra-

Hence, the non-oscillating Fourier component of the ﬁeld
radiated by a bounded conducting wire does not vanish
in the far ﬁeld, locally (see Eq. (7)). It seems here that

ﬁeld (bottom). Globally, the temporal average of the radiated
ﬁeld is zero. But, when the delay between two successive vari-
ations of current is suﬃciently large (t2 − t1 >> ∆t), the ﬁeld
appears as two isolated unipolar pulses, separated in space by
a distance equal to c (t2 − t1).

reveals that the temporal average of an electromagnetic
signal can vanish or not, depending on how it has been
produced. Consequently, we observe that the derivation
provided by Belenov and Nazarkin [5] corresponds to a
special family of wave packets, namely zero-area pulses,
whose vector potential has the same strength at t =

Here, we have described the case of a bounded conduct-
ing wire. We have shown that the variations of current
inside the wire produce a series of unipolar electromag-
netic pulses that travel in free space at the speed of light ;
the amplitude of these pulses falls oﬀ as 1/r far from the
wire. Locally, the temporal average of an isolated unipo-
lar pulse is not zero. Consequently, we are convinced that
the non-oscillating component of an electromagnetic ﬁeld
can interact with matter over extended regions of space.

speed of light and whose amplitude falls oﬀ as 1/r far
from the source. We Recall that the radiated electric
ﬁeld is proportional to ∂ tJ(t) – via E(r, t) =
∂ tA(r, t),
the ﬁeld given at Eq. (6) is thus free of any static ﬁeld,
i.e. a ﬁeld whose amplitude is constant in time (see also
Brabec and Krausz [4]).

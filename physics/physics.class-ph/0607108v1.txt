The nonlinear evolution of a vortex sheet driven by the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability is characterized by the
formation of a spiral possessing complex stretching and intensity patterns. We show that the power energy
spectrum of a single two-dimensional vortex sheet tends to the usual ﬂuid turbulent spectrum, with an exponent
of −3. Using numerical simulations and asymptotic methods, we demonstrate the relation between this power
law and the singularities in the geometry and vorticity distribution of the sheet.

In 1941, Kolmogorov formulated a theory of ﬂuid turbu-
lence, based on the idea of statistical similarity [1]. In par-
allel, Onsager proposed that a singular enough velocity ﬁeld
could explain dissipation without the “ﬁnal assistance of vis-
cosity” [2, 3]. (A thorough review on Kolmogorov theory can
be found in the book by U. Frisch [4]. Onsager’s work on tur-
bulence is accounted for in Ref. [5].) These two complemen-
tary approaches, the one statistical, the other dynamical, can
be taken as constitutive of further theoretical developments on
turbulence. One diﬃcult problem, whose solution would con-
tribute to understanding the physics of turbulent ﬂows, is to
establish the relation existing between dynamics and statistics,
in particular ﬂows. Following the theoretical ideas ﬁrst intro-
duced by Townsend [6], Lundgren proposed a relation of this
type in his model of intermittent structures at high Reynolds
numbers [7, 8]. Lundgren demonstrated that solutions of the
Navier–Stokes equation in the form of slender spiral vortices
yield Kolmogorov spectrum, through a mechanism of enstro-
phy intensiﬁcation and creation of ﬁne scales by diﬀerential
rotation and stretching. In two dimensional ﬂows, Gilbert [9]
studied the wind-up of a vortex patch by a strong point vortex,
and found that an energy spectrum E(k) ∼ k−γ with 3 < γ < 4,
is obtained from the fractal structure of the spiral separating
potential and vortical regions. The goal of this Letter is to
study the relation between geometry, vorticity distribution and
spectral properties of the ﬂow generated by the winding-up of
a shear layer subject to the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability.

In two dimensions, and in the limit of vanishing viscosity, a
shear layer becomes a line of velocity discontinuity. The Euler
ﬂow associated with a vortex sheet reduces to the Hamiltonian
dynamics given by the Birkhoﬀ–Rott equation [10, 11],

In Eq. (1) the vortex sheet is represented by the parametric ex-
pression of the curve z = Z(s, t), where z = x + iy is a complex
coordinate and s is the arclength, ds = |dZ|. The Biot–Savart
kernel is deﬁned by K(z) = 1/z or K(z) = cot(πz)/2 in the

principal value integral, and the over bar denotes the complex
conjugate. A sinusoidal perturbation of a straight vortex sheet
evolves towards a singularity in ﬁnite time, as demonstrated
by Moore in 1979 [12, 13], probably related to the incipient
rolling-up of the sheet into a spiral. In order to integrate (1)
in time, it is then necessary to regularize the kernel. A simple
method consists in cutting the vortex interaction at a distance
δ, therefore replacing K ∼ 1/z by Kδ = ¯z/(|z|2 + δ2) [14].
Solutions of the regularized Birkhoﬀ–Rott equation, with K
replaced by Kδ, tend to solutions of the Euler equation in the
limit δ → 0 [15]. It is worth noting that the dynamics of the
desingularized (1) remains Hamiltonian. As a consequence,
this model is particularly well suited to investigate the dy-
namics of the turbulent cascade in one of the most basic ﬂow
structures, the Kelvin–Helmholtz unstable vortex sheet.

We used the blob vortex method of Krasny [14] to compute
the dynamics of a shear layer in a periodic domain of length
L. We take units such that L = 1 and the circulation is in
the interval Γ ∈ [0, 1] (or the unperturbed velocity disconti-
nuity equal to one). The initial perturbation, as for example
the superposition of small amplitude modes, evolves towards
the formation of a system of spirals winding around the main
one. These structures are driven by a cascade of secondary
Kelvin–Helmholtz instabilities, as shown in Ref. [16]. Fig-
ure 1 presents the vortex sheet formed from an initial condi-
tion of two modes with wavelengths 1 and 1/4, together with
the strain rate S (s, t) and the intensity κ(s, t). The strain rate is
deﬁned by S = (1/∆s)d∆s/dt, where ∆s → 0, is the arclength
separation of two neighboring points on the vortex sheet. Di-
minishing the value of δ, the relevant physical limit is δ → 0,
results in a drastic increasing of small scale features of the
sheet winding [17] (see also [18]). We study numerically the
generation of the small scales resulting from the short wave in-
stabilities, in the presence of nontrivial stretching and vorticity
concentration eﬀects. Indeed, arbitrarily small scale perturba-
tions might grow, depending for instance on the local strain
rate [16], and regions of strong localized vortex intensity de-
velop as observed in Fig. 1(b). The origin of these small scale
features, can be traced back to the highly oscillatory behavior
of the vortex sheet stretching, whose dynamics is essentially
Lagrangian and nonlocal (Fig. 1(c)). The presence of strong
velocity gradients (in the limit δ → 0) possessing a wide range

of space and time scales, responsible for the appearance of an
increasingly complex velocity ﬁeld, can be considered to be
the root of a turbulent ﬂow. We found indeed, that the ﬂow
created by this single shear layer becomes turbulent, in the
sense that it is characterized by a well deﬁned power law en-
ergy spectrum Ek ∼ k−γ (for k ≪ 2π/δ, and 3 < γ < 4), in
agreement with full Navier–Stokes simulations with random
initial vorticity ﬁeld [19, 20].

It is then natural to look at the energy spectrum, Ek = E(k)
of the sheet. However, in order to avoid the arbitrariness in the
origin of coordinates we deﬁne a one-dimensional spectrum
from the y-direction average of the velocity v(x, y) correlation
function c(ξ) ,

and others [9, 21, 22], satisﬁes the condition that the con-
0 dk|vk|2 =
served total energy E, is given by
E, where, vk = Fk[v]. We measured the spectrum (2) of the
R
vortex sheet shown in Fig. 1, and found that for k ≪ 2π/δ,
it is well ﬁtted by a power law Ek ∼ k−2.94 close to the law
observed in developed decaying two-dimensional turbulence
[19]. In fact, the actual value of the exponent follows the evo-
lution of the initially regular vortex sheet. The value γ ≈ 3 is
reached after the development of the secondary structures (see
the insert in Fig. 1). At the early stages of the winding, inter-
mediate values 3 < γ < 4 are measured, with a low wavenum-
ber range dominated by γ ≈ 3, and a large wavenumber range
having a steeper spectrum. The γ ≈ 3 range of k increases
with time, and at t = 0.386 it extends almost over all the
available range (0 < k < 2π/δ).

niﬁcant range in the turbulent spectrum we proceeded for the

ﬁrst time to a quadruple precision computation (33 signiﬁcant
digits), using δ = 0.01 and N = 215 vortices.

As it is well known, the superposition of velocity disconti-
nuities yields a spectrum in Ek ∼ k−2 [6], while a superposi-
tion of vorticity discontinuities yields Ek ∼ k−4 [21], the clas-
sical enstrophy cascade picture gives Ek ∼ k−3 [23]. It would
be interesting, as suggested by Moﬀatt [24], to establish a rela-
tionship between the fractal structure of the rolled shear layer
and the observed energy spectrum, characterized by an inter-
mediate value of the exponent. (It is worth mentioning that for
ﬁnite δ the velocity ﬁeld is continuous.) The fractal dimension
dF of the spiral in Fig. 1 is found to be dF ≃ 1.44. This value
can be compared to dF = 1.33 measured in Ref. [25], for a
single Kelvin–Helmholtz spiral and for a large value of the
smoothing parameter δ = 0.25. Assuming that the formula
γ = −5 + dF relating the energy exponent to the fractal di-
mension, derived by Gilbert [9] in his study of a spiral vortex
patch, holds in the present case, we obtain a value γ ≈ 3.56,
somewhat larger than the observed one. The diﬀerence may
be attributed to the nonuniformity in the distribution of the
vorticity.

It is then tempting to conjecture that the characteristic ex-
ponent of the spectrum γ reﬂects, not only the fractal spiral
structure of the sheets, but also the existence of singularities

in both the shape and the intensity of the vortex sheet. Remark
that the existence of such type of singularities is not related to
eventual singularities in Euler ﬂows, the velocity ﬁeld outside
the sheet is always regular in our case. Indeed, we can use the
Biot–Savart equation for the velocity ﬁeld to relate γ with the
characteristic exponents α and β of the shape Z(s) ∼ sα and
intensity κ(s) ∼ sβ singularities, respectively:

that, in the limit of δ → 0, the curvature diverges at a point
s0, where it changes sign, leading to the eventual formation
of a new spiral (Fig. 4). In order to identify the nature of this
singularity we assume that the behavior of the vortex sheet
around s = s0, can be analyzed within a local approximation
[26], therefore neglecting the contour integral in the computa-
tion of the principal value of the Birkhoﬀ–Rott term,

(4)

Therefore, Ek = |vk|2 ∼ k−γ implies γ = 2(β + 1)/α. The
exponents α and β can be directly measured from the data of
Fig. 3, where we display the shape Z(s) (after subtraction of
Γ(s), in order to obtain a periodic function Z(Γ + 1) = Z(Γ), in
terms of the parameter Γ) and its spectrum together with the
one of the intensity. In Fourier space we have |Zk|2 ∼ k−2α−2
and |κk|2 ∼ k−2β−2, it follows that α = 0.22 and β = −0.66,
giving γ = 3 in agreement with the exponent measured from
the energy.

We found that the intensity concentrations shown in Fig. 1
are related with regions characterized by the strong advec-
tion of secondary structures. Indeed, during the evolution of
secondary instabilities, ﬁlamentary sheets are advected by the
previous formed intense vortices (the central tightly wounded
region of the spirals). A simple model describing this situa-
tion, consists of a ﬁxed strong point vortex advecting an ini-
tially straight weak intensity vortex sheet.

The evolution of the sheet z = Z(s, t) of intensity κ(s, t) =
dΓ(s, t)/ds, s is the arclength, is given by a Birkhoﬀ–Rott
equation with an external velocity ﬁeld due to the point vortex
of circulation Γ0:

Initially one may consider that the sheet is located at a distance
d in the y direction from the central point vortex, Z(s, 0) =
s + id. If one neglects the self-interaction, the advection of the
sheet is described by the curve, Z = z0(s, t) = (s + id)eiΩ(s)t,
where Ω(s) = Γ0/2π(d2 + s2). However, a singularity can-
not result from the sole advection, and the eﬀect of self-
interaction is needed. Direct integration of (5) actually shows

where we introduced non-dimensional variables based on the
time unit 2πd2/Γ0 and the space unit d. The non-dimensional
parameter a = πκ0d/Γ0 ≪ 1 measures the circulation ratio be-
tween the central point vortex and the sheet. In the following
we put the point z = Z(s0, t0) corresponding to the singularity,
at the origin s0 = 0 and t0 = 0. Moreover, the transformation
Z(s, t) = r(s, t) exp[iφ(s, t) + iΩ(s)t], allows to separate the dy-
namics of the complex amplitude reiφ from the pure rotation
at frequency Ω, and leads, after substitution into (6), to the
two real equations,

We assume now, that the form of the sheet near de singu-
larity can be written as r = r0 + sgn(st)R)(s, t) and φ =
φ0 + H(t)Φ)(s, t), with the regular parts determined by the ad-
vection r0(s) = |z0| = [1 + (s + s0)2]1/2 and φ0(s) = arg(z0) =
arctan(s + s0) + π/2 + Ωt0, and where the singular parts R(s, t)
and Φ(s, t), should possess strong derivatives near s ≈ 0. This
can be satisﬁed if R ∼ |s|q, with the condition q < 1. We in-
troduced the sign sgn(st) and the Heaviside H(t) functions, to
reproduce the jump in the curvature |∆C(t)|, as observed in the
numerical computations of Fig. 4, together with the smooth-
ness of the phase Φ(s, t) before the singularity. Substituting
these expressions into (7-8), and neglecting small terms in
|s| ≪ 1] (we can a posteriori verify the consistency of these
assumptions), we get,

where f (st) is an arbitrary smooth function, that can be ne-
glected. We note that the solution of (9) naturally leads to
q = 1/2, and to the scalings: Rs ≫ r0Φs for t ≪ 1, justifying
the assumption that the second term in the denominator of (7-
8) is negligible near the singularity. It is also worth noting that
this singularity is stronger than the one found by Moore [12],
whose characteristic exponent is q = 3/2 > 1, the diﬀerence
coming from the presence of the advection velocity ﬁeld.

In this Letter the k−3 energy spectrum of two dimensional
turbulence is recovered in a simple model of a single, regu-
larized, vortex sheet evolving according to a Hamiltonian dy-
namics. The vortex sheet is subject to a cascade of Kelvin–
Helmholtz instabilities, leading to spiral windings at diﬀerent
scales. The ﬂow is characterized by an intermittent distribu-
tion of the vorticity intensity along the vortex sheet, and by a
complex sequence of compression and stretching regions re-
sulting from the nonlocal Lagrangian dynamics of the strain.
The sole consideration of the fractal structure of the spiral
windings is not enough to account for the observed spectrum.
A simple dimensional argument using the Biot–Savart equa-
tion, allows to relate the exponents of the singularities in the
shape and the intensity of the vortex sheet, with the spec-
trum exponent. We propose a mechanism for the formation

4

of strong secondary singularities, associated with jumps in
the curvature, by the simultaneous action of the advection and
self-interaction of the vortex sheet. A simple model describes
the structure of the sheet near the singularity in the form of a
square root cusp Z(s) ∼ sgn(s)|s|q, with an exponent q = 1/2.
This value is suﬃciently small to be in agreement with the
requirement that 3 < γ < 4. If one assumes that q ∼ α, the
condition (β+1)/2 < q ∼ α < 2/3 should hold. The formation
of singular concentrations of vorticity in regions with diverg-
ing curvature, constitute a dynamical mechanism towards a
turbulent dissipation in the limit of vanishing viscosity.

φ being any component of E,B. From eq. (2) follows that the velocity of advancement
of the related wave surface (front velocity) is c [1], the speed of light in vacuum. For a
wave packet, it is of particular relevance also the concept of “group velocity”, being the
velocity vgr with which the maximum of the wave packet propagates. To this regard, it is
commonly believed that the group velocity of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum takes
always the value c. However, there is no proof [2] that electromagnetic waves with vgr = c
are the only solutions of eq. (1) or (2) and, in particular, there are many works [3, 4]
dealing with both vgr < c and vgr > c solutions.

(2)

On the experimental side, many recent experiments on photonic tunneling conducted
with diﬀerent techniques and in diﬀerent ranges of frequency [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] have shown that,
in peculiar conditions, (evanescent) electromagnetic waves travel a barrier with (group)
velocity vgr > c. In these experiments, as remembered in [10], only the group velocity can
be determined, so that these results obviously do not violate Einstein causality because,
according to Sommerfeld and Brillouin [11], it is the front velocity (not group velocity) to
be relevant for this and, as stated above, the Maxwell theory predicts that electromagnetic
waves in vacuum have always a constant front velocity equal to c.

From the theoretical point of view, the diﬃculty in the interpretation of the experi-
mental results lies mainly in the fact that in the barrier traversal no group velocity can be
deﬁned, the wave number being imaginary (evanescent waves), so that the time required
for the traversal (directly measured) is not univocally deﬁneable 1[12].

In this paper we want to give a simple but general method for building up solutions
= c that generalizes previous
of Maxwell equations propagating with group velocity vgr 6
calculations [4] and to show how the theory could describe, almost qualitatively, the ex-
perimental evidence for vgr > c electromagnetic propagation. To this purpose, in the
following section the general formalism is outlined while in section 3 this formalism is
applied to electromagnetic signals in a wave guide.
In section 4 the experimental evi-
dence on photonic tunneling is reviewed and discussed, and its possible description in our
approach is shown together with future possible tests.

1 Incidentally, we quote the introduction of the concept of “phase time” which is a generalization of

that of group velocity, and it is applicable in this case.

However, it is worth noting that the theory developed in section 2 can be applied as
well to propagation of usual electromagnetic waves in a medium (making the substitution
c
c/n, n being the refractive index); in this case our approach can be an alternative
one to well known phenomena such as, for example, plasma oscillations, Cherenkov eﬀect
and so on.

2 General formalism

In the experiments performed on superluminal barrier traversal, the wavelength λ of the
incident electromagnetic signal is always greater than or, at least, of the some order of
a typical length of the experimental apparatus [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. So, we have to use an
approximation just opposite to the eikonal approximation, and we search for solution of
eq.(2) in the form

φ(x, t) = φ0(x, t; k, ω) ei(k·x−ωt)
with an amplitude φ0 strongly dependent on 4-position x, t. Substituting in eq.(2) we ﬁnd
the equation satisﬁed by φ0:

For illustrative purpose we consider one-dimensional problems; taking φ0 dependent only

on ζ = z

Here we observe that, if ω = ck (and then v = c), eq.(5) is automatically satisﬁed,

solutions are not the only ones. As we will show now, there are also v
these can be obtained imposing a “quantiﬁcation rule” (in the sense that it quantiﬁes the
eﬀective dispersion relation) specifying how strong the eikonal approximation is violated.

Let us impose that φ0 in addition to eq. (5) satisﬁes also

dispersion relation (8) or the group velocity in eq. (9) can be further measured.

Now, instead of eq. (6), let us impose the following equation

Note that even in this case φ0 satisﬁes a harmonic motion equation (14); now, however,
both k and v are always real, so that we have no evanescent waves.

Incidentally, let us observe [4] that our subluminal solutions can be equivalently con-
structed by requiring that φ0 satisﬁes an Helmoltz wave equation on which solutions a
Lorentz boost, for example in the z direction, is applied. However, we again point out the
fact that a quantiﬁcation rule can be realized only by construction of a given experiment.
Let us now discuss this last point and, in particular, the introduction of the param-
eter Ω in the eﬀective dispersion relations. For simplicity, we conﬁne ourselves only to
subluminal group velocities, but the same will remain valid also for the superluminal case.
Our method is based mainly on eq. (6) which admits, for given initial conditions, an
univocal solution φ0 in (7) and then φ in (3). This wave, product of waves, is what one can
measure and is univocally determined by the experimental setup employed. In this sense,
the parameter Ω is given “by construction” once the experiment is given. For example,
in experiments operating in the eikonal approximation regime (this is not the case of
photonic tunneling experiments), namely when the wavelength λ of the electromagnetic
signal is much lower than a typical length of the experimental apparatus, the parameter
Ω is zero. On the contrary, in experiments with wave guides one can experimentally
determine Ω by measuring the (eﬀective) “cutoﬀ” frequency (as we will show in the next
section, the introduction of Ω leads to a modiﬁcation of the cutoﬀ frequency of the wave
guide).

Finally, we stress that the actual theory can be consistently tested only in problems
In fact, let us consider, for example, an incident signal
in more than one dimension.
on a wave guide:
it is well known that the signal eﬀectively propagates (with a ﬁnite
group velocity) only in the axial direction, while across the guide a non-physical signal
propagates with an arbitrarily high group velocity. In the following section we will show
how our approach can be applied to realistic problems by giving a speciﬁc example.

3 An application: wave packets in a wave guide

As an application let us consider the propagation of an electromagnetic wave packet in
a hollow wave guide, placed along the z axis, of arbitrary (but constant) cross-sectional
shape with boundary surfaces being perfect conductors (the development of this paragraph
is a generalization of chapter 8 of [13]). If ω is the frequency of the incident signal, let us
write the spatial and temporal dependence of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld inside the
guide as

E(x, y, z, t) = E0(x, y, ζ) ei(kz−ωt)
B(x, y, z, t) = B0(x, y, ζ) ei(kz−ωt)

while for ω < ωc we are in the evanescent waves regime. Note that the eﬀective cutoﬀ
frequency ωc is greater than the usual value ω0c = cΓ (Ω = 0) and furthermore, for
evanescent modes, the z-dependence does not show a pure exponential decay but is of the
type eiγΩze−|k|z (obviously we take Ω always real).

Now, let us consider the most interesting case for which v > c; we can easily prove

that no cutoﬀ arise. In fact, calculating the group velocity from eq. (35)

we ﬁnd that it is eﬀectively v > c only if the condition

is fulﬁlled. This condition makes that in eq. (35) the wave number is always real. Note
that if c2Ω2 < ω2
0c we again have propagation with v < c, with the same features as
discussed above, but now the eﬀective cutoﬀ frequency ωc = c √Γ2
Ω2 is lower than
the usual value ω0c.

−

The obtained results bring to a very important consequence: a group velocity (and
then a traversal time) can always be coherently deﬁned for v > c propagation. Notice
that the fact that Ω is a property of the experimental setup (see at the end of the previous
section) guarantees the univocity of the identiﬁcation vgr = v(ω0) (v depending on Ω) and
so ambiguities in the deﬁnition of the traversal time are really not present.

4 Discussion on photonic tunneling

Recently Martin and Landauer [14] have shown that the propagation of electromagnetic
evanescent waves in a wave guide can be viewed as a photonic tunneling process through a
barrier; this facilitates the experimental study of tunneling phenomena, due to the charge
neutrality of photons with respect to other particles such as electrons. From the theoretical
point of view, an open question is that of the barrier traversal time, because in the barrier
region the momentum of the tunneling particle is imaginary so that no velocity can be
deﬁned. There are several approaches to the problem [12] leading to diﬀerent deﬁnitions
of the traversal time. Instead, experimentally this time can be univocally measured, for
example, from the coincidence of two photons, one travelling through the barrier and the
other travelling in vacuum.

Enders and Nimtz [5, 6] have studied photonic tunneling by means of microwave trans-
mission through undersized wave guides operating below their cutoﬀ (of the order of 6
9
GHz) and have obtained traversal times (for opaque barriers) from pulsed measurements
in the time domain or, indirectly, in the frequency domain. Alternatively, Steinberg,
Kwiat and Chiao [7] and later Spielmann, Szip¨ocs and Krausz [8] employed some 1D pho-
tonic band-gap material as barrier for measuring tunneling times, in the UV and optical
region respectively, with the aid of a two-photon interferometer.

÷

7

The experimental evidence can be summarized as follows. Both in microwave and
in photonic band-gap experiments photonic tunneling is observed; if the barrier medium
is non-dissipative, the traversal time in this opaque region is nearly independent of the
barrier thickness (Hartman eﬀect [15]), so that for particular values of this length super-
luminal group velocities have been inferred. Furthermore, two strange properties have
been detected. First, in microwave experiments, dissipative tunneling studies have shown
that the Hartman eﬀect disappears with increasing dissipation [6]. Second, the measure-
ments of the tunneling of optical pulses through photonic band-gaps reveal that the pulses
transmitted through a particular sample are signiﬁcatively shorter than the incident ones
[8]; this eﬀect disappears for increasing transmission coeﬃcients. The latter two eﬀects
seem to indicate, in our opinion, that real propagation in the opaque region happens, and
this stimulates to apply our theory to the present case. For example, we stress that a
usual mass term (for v < c) or a tachionic mass [16] for the photon (for v > c) cannot
take into account the observed superluminal tunneling, because of the dependence on the
barrier thickness of the measured group velocity (i.e. the dependence on a characteristic
parameter and not on an intrinsic one such as usual or tachionic mass). Instead, our quan-
tiﬁcation frequency Ω is not an intrinsic property, but would just depend on the employed
experimental setup, so that the dependence on it of the group velocity (see for example
eq. (37) ) seems to go in the right direction for taking into account the superluminal
tunneling. Moreover, the simple fact that in our approach a group velocity can always be
deﬁned for superluminal propagation eliminates the ambiguities in the deﬁnition of the
traversal time.

On the other hand, our theory can be tested independently from photonic tunneling,
for example constructing “ad hoc” an electromagnetic apparatus which realizes eq. (6) or
(14) in some regions and then measuring the dispersion relation between ω and k or the
group velocity of the propagating waves.

5 Conclusions

= c of the solutions of Maxwell
We have studied the propagation with group velocity vgr 6
equations (in vacuum) and have shown that it is possible (and not violating Einstein
causality) provided a peculiar space-temporal dependence of the wave amplitude is given
through a deﬁnite quantiﬁcation rule.

As an application of the presented formalism we have considered the propagation in a
wave guide and obtained, for vgr < c, a diﬀerent eﬀective cutoﬀ frequency respect to the
normal case, while for vgr > c no eﬀective cutoﬀ arises so that the wave number is always
real and a group velocity can always be deﬁned. In the evanescent regime for the vgr < c
case, moreover, the real propagating waves show not a pure exponential decay but are
only damped waves.

Discussing photonic tunneling, we have pointed out how the presented approach can
qualitatively describe the experimental evidences on this eﬀect, even if deﬁnitive con-
clusions are not yet reached and further experimental and theoretical investigations are

8

needed.

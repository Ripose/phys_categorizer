Abstract – Some recent experiments, performed at Berkeley, Cologne, Florence and

Vienna led to the claim that something seems to travel with a speed larger than the speed

c of light in vacuum. Various other experimental results seem to point in the same direc-

tion: For instance, localized wavelet-type solutions of Maxwell equations have been found,

both theoretically and experimentally, that travel with Superluminal speed. Even muonic

and electronic neutrinos —it has been proposed— might be “tachyons”, since their square

mass appears to be negative; not to mention the apparent Superluminal expansions ob-

served in the core of quasars and, recently, in the so-called galactic microquasars.

In

the ﬁrst part of this paper we verify, on the basis of the numerical solution of Maxwell

equations, that waves propagating down a microwave guide can travel with Superluminal

group velocity, just conﬁrming some of the previously mentioned experimental results.

Then, we have to face the question of Superluminal motions within the theory of Special

Relativity.

It is not widely recognized that all such theoretical and experimental results

do not place relativistic causality in jeopardy. For instance, it is possible (at least in

microphysics) to solve also the known causal paradoxes, devised for “faster than light”

motion. Here we show, in detail and rigorously, how to solve the oldest causal paradox,

originally proposed by Tolman, which is the kernel of many further tachyon paradoxes.

The key to the solution is a careful application of tachyon mechanics, as it unambiguously

follows from Special Relativity.

Introduction. – Superluminal propagation has been observed in several areas of physics(1).
In electromagnetism, in particular, some recent experiments performed at Cologne(2),
Berkeley(3), Florence and Vienna with evanescent waves (“tunnelling photons”) led to
the claim that evanescent modes can travel with a group velocity larger than the speed c

of light in vacuum, thus conﬁrming some older predictions(4). Even more recently, some
of the main experimental claims (e.g., in (2)) have been veriﬁed(5) just by solving the
Maxwell equations with the requested boundary conditions.

Various other experimental results seem to point in the same direction: For in-

stance,
localized wavelet-type solutions of Maxwell equations have been found, both
theoretically(1) and experimentally(6), that travel with Superluminal speed. Even muonic
and electronic neutrinos —it has been proposed— might be “tachyons”, since their square
mass appears to be negative(7); not to mention the apparent Superluminal expansions ob-
served in the core of quasars(8) and, recently, in the so-called galactic microquasars(9).
Nevertheless, all such data or results do not seem to place relativistic causality in jeopardy.

In fact, when Special Relativity (SR) is not restricted to subluminal objects, so that it

expands into the so-called Extended Relativity, one is left with a theory describing also

Superluminal objects and waves on the basis of the ordinary postulates of SR. As far
as the foundations of Extended Relativity are concerned, we shall only quote ref.(10) and
references therein. Here we shall mainly conﬁne our attention to the fact that it is possible

to solve (also) the known causal paradoxes, devised for “faster than light” motion, even

if this is not widely recognized.

We shall come back soon to this point. First, however, let us brieﬂy examine for
instance the experiments in refs.(2), by making recourse to work performed by A.Pablo
L.Barbero and H.E. Hern´andez-Figueroa at UNICAMP.(5)

Theoretical veriﬁcation of microwave Superluminal propagation. – The inset (a)

in Fig.1 shows the waveguide used in those experiments. Launching a TE10 signal, limited

in frequency by ωm such that ωm < ωc, where ωc is the cutoﬀ frequency for the fundamental

mode in the “undersized” waveguide (or “barrier”), those authors showed that the transit

time of the signal along the barrier is independent of its length a. This agrees, incidentally,
with the eﬀect predicted by quantum mechanics for particle tunnelling(11): an eﬀect that
we called “Hartman eﬀect”. Considering that purely evanescent waves travel in principle

with inﬁnite speed, the ﬁnite Superluminal speed encountered in those measurements can

be attributed to the delay induced by the geometrical discontinuities present at the barrier

edges. Using a spectrum analyzer, the transfer function associated with the barrier can

be gotten by measuring the S-parameter. The phase of the transfer function for four

diﬀerent barrier lengths (40, 60, 80 1nd 100 mm) is shown in Fig.2(b); notice that such
four curves are practically superposed.(5)

In order to check those experimental results, in ref.(5) it was adopted a numerical

2

code based on the method of moments (MoM), widely used in the design of microwave

ﬁlters and other devices by the Antennas Research Group at CPqD-Telebr´as, Brazil. Such

a code solves the Maxwell equations in the frequency domain, in presence of transitions

associated with inductive (vertical) discontinuities only (Fig.1, inset b). Notice that the

experimental setup in inset a of Fig.1, is not really very diﬀerent, even if it takes into

account also capacitive (horizontal) discontinuities: the latter, in fact, produce a transfer

function whose phase, as a function of the frequency, is practically constant, and their
magnitude is much smaller than the one produced by the inductive discontinuities.(12)

We adopted(5) a pulse modulated by a Kaiser-Bessel window, producing a signal with
a limited spectrum, between 8.2 and 9.2 GHz, similar to the input signal used in (2). The
transfer functions were computed for barriers of 40, 60 and 100 mm. The phases of such

functions are shown in Fig.2a: notice their superposition. The maximum magnitudes of

the output pulses were 0.05743, 0.01248 and 0.00062 for the 40, 60 and 100 mm barriers,

respectively. These values were normalized with respect to the maximum magnitude of
the input pulse, and exhibit an error of less than 4% relative to the experimental results(2).
The computed phase (Fig.2a) and the measured one (Fig.2b) are in qualitative agreement;

they diﬀer by a shift of about 10 degrees, due —as already mentioned— to the capacity

discontinuities, considered in the experiment and ignored in our simulations. Next, by
using the Fourier transform, we computed(5) the pulse propagation in the time domain:
the transit time for the input signal to travel down the three diﬀerent barriers (of 40, 60

and 100 mm) was the same: 115 ps. Figure 1 shows the output signals for the three
In refs.(2) the measured transit time was 130 ps; the diﬀerence of 15 ps may be

barriers.

due again to the capacity discontinuities.

In conclusion, just by solving the Maxwell equations, we can conﬁrm the main exper-
imental results in (2).
In ref.(13), experiments with two barriers suggest the possibility of
long-distance Superluminal propagation: we shall examine that case elsewhere(5). Here
we want to discuss a more general question. If something can travel with a speed larger

than the speed c of light in vacuum, as suggested not only by the previous considera-

tions but also by the results known from the abovementioned three further sectors of

experimental physics (see Appendix B), then one has to face the problem of Superluminal

motions from the point of view of Special Relativity. We have already claimed that all

the previous results do not seem to place relativistic causality in jeopardy.

In fact, when

Special Relativity (SR) is not restricted to subluminal objects, so that it expands into

the so-called Extended Relativity, one is left with a theory describing also Superluminal

objects and waves on the basis of the ordinary postulates of SR. As far as the founda-

3

tions of Extended Relativity are concerned, we shall only quote ref.(14−16) and references
therein, and in particular ref.(10); while we shall expound what is necessary for our present
purposes in the Sections below and in Appendix A.

Let us then pass to the problem of solving the causal paradoxes arising for for “faster

than light” motions.

Superluminal motions and relativistic causality – In fact, claims exist since long
that all the ordinary causal paradoxes proposed for tachyons can be solved(14−16) (at
least “in microphysics”) on the basis of the “switching procedure” (swp) introduced by
St¨uckelberg(17), Feynman(17) and Sudarshan(14), also known as the reinterpretation prin-
ciple: a principle which in refs.(10,15) by Recami et al. has been given the status of a
fundamental postulate of special relativity, both for bradyons [slower–than–light parti-
cles] and for tachyons. Schwartz,(18) at last, gave the swp a formalization in which it
becomes “automatic”.

However, the eﬀectiveness of the swp and of that solution is often overlooked, or mis-

understood. Here we want therefore to show, in detail and rigorously, how to solve the
oldest “paradox”, i.e. the antitelephone one, originally proposed by Tolman(19) and then
reproposed by many authors. We shall refer to its recent formulation by Regge,(20) and
spend some care in solving it, since it is the kernel of many other paradoxes. Let us stress

that:

(i) any careful solution of the tachyon causal “paradoxes” has to make recourse

to explicit calculations based on the mechanics of tachyons;

(ii) such tachyon mechan-

ics can be unambiguously and uniquely derived from SR, by referring the Superluminal
(V 2 > c2) objects to the class of the ordinary, subluminal (u2 < c2) observers only (i.e.,
(iii) moreover, the
without any need of introducing “Superluminal reference frames”);

comprehension of the whole subject will be substantially enhanced if one refers himself to

rather than on its orthochronous subgroup

the (subluminal, ordinary) SR based on the whole proper Lorentz group

Before going on, let us mention the following. It is a known fact that in the time-

independent case the (relativistic, non-quantistic) Helmholtz equation and the (non-
relativistic, quantum) Schroedinger equation are formally identical(22) [in the time-dependent
case, such equations become actually diﬀerent, but nevertheless strict relations still hold
between some solutions of theirs, as it will be explicitly shown elsewhere(23)]: one impor-

4

tant consequence of this fact being that evanescent wave transmission simulates electron
tunnelling. On the other side, a wave-packet had been predicted(24) since long to tun-
nel through an (opaque) barrier with Superluminal group-velocity. Therefore, one could
expect evanescent waves too to be endowed with Superluminal (group) speeds.(25) The
abovenamed experiments(1−3), which seem to have actually veriﬁed such an expectation,
are the ones that most attracted the attention of the scientiﬁc press.(26) But they are
not the only ones which seem to indicate the existence of Superluminal motions.27

Tachyon mechanics. – In refs.(28) the basic tachyon mechanics can be found exploited
a) proper (or “intrinsic”) emission of a tachyon T by an ordinary

for the processes:

body A; b) “intrinsic” absorption of a tachyon T by an ordinary body A; where the

term “intrinsic” refers to the fact that those processes (emission, absorption by A) are

described as they appear in the rest-frame of A; particle T can represent both a tachyon

and an antitachyon. Let us recall the following results only.

Let us ﬁrst consider a tachyon moving with velocity V in a reference frame s0. If
we pass to a second frame s′, endowed with velocity u w.r.t. (with respect to) frame s0,
then the new observer s′ will see —instead of the initial tachyon T— an antitachyon T
travelling the opposite way in space (due to the swp: cf. Appendix A), if and only if

u

V > c2 .

·

Recall in particular that, if u

V < 0, the “switching” does never come into play.

·

Now, let us explore some of the unusual and unexpected consequences of the trivial

fact that in the case of tachyons it is

where we chose units so that, numerically, c = 1.

Let us, e.g., describe the phenomenon of “intrinsic emission” of a tachyon, as seen in

the rest frame of the emitting body: Namely, let us consider in its rest frame an ordinary

body A, with initial rest mass M, which emits a tachyon (or antitachyon) T endowed
with (real) rest mass(6) m
(ET, p), and velocity V along the
x-axis. Let M ′ be the ﬁnal rest mass of body A. The four-momentum conservation requires

Notice that in the generic frame s the process of (intrinsic) emission can appear either

as a T emission or as a T absorption (due to a possible “switching”) by body A. The
following theorem, however, holds:(28)

Theorem 1: << A necessary and suﬃcient condition for a process to be a tachyon emission

Let us now describe the process of “intrinsic absorption” of a tachyon by body A; i.e.,

let us consider an ordinary body A to absorb in its rest frame a tachyon (or antitachyon)

T, travelling again with speed V along the x-direction. The four-momentum conservation

absorption in the A-rest-frame —i.e., to be an intrinsic absorption— is that ∆

≥ −

We now have to describe the tachyon exchange between two ordinary bodies A and B.

We have to consider the four-momentum conservation at A and at B; we need to choose

a (single) frame relative to which we describe the whole interaction; let us choose the

rest-frame of A. Let us explicitly remark, however, that —when bodies A and B exchange

one tachyon T— the tachyon mechanics is such that the “intrinsic descriptions” of the
processes at A and at B can a priori correspond to one of the following four cases(28):

(12)

Case 3) can happen, of course, only when the tachyon exchange takes place in the receding

phase (i.e., while A, B are receding from each other); case 4) can happen, by contrast,

only in the approaching phase.

Let us consider here only the particular tachyon exchanges in which we have an

7

“intrinsic emission” at A, and in which moreover the velocities u of B and V of T w.r.t.
V > 1. Because of the last condition and the consequent
body A are such that u

“switching” (cf. Eq.(1)), from the rest-frame of B one will therefore observe the ﬂight of

an antitachyon T emitted by B and absorbed by A (the necessary condition for this to

·

happen, let us recall, being that A, B recede from each other).

More generally, the dynamical conditions for a tachyon to be exchangeable between

A and B can be shown to be the following:

I) Case of “intrinsic emission” at A:

if u

V < 1 ,

then ∆B >

intrinsic absorption at B);

if u

V > 1 ,

then ∆B <

intrinsic emission at B).

II) Case of “intrinsic absorption” at A:

if u

V < 1 ,

then ∆B <

intrinsic emission at B);

if u

V > 1 ,

then ∆B >

intrinsic absorption at B).

Now, let us ﬁnally pass to examine the Tolman paradox.

The paradox. – In Figs.3, 4 the axes t and t′ are the world-lines of two devices A
and B, respectively, which are able to exchange tachyons and move with constant relative
speed u, [u2 < 1], along the x-axis. According to the terms of the paradox (Fig.3), device
A sends tachyon 1 to B (in other words, tachyon 1 is supposed to move forward in time

w.r.t. device A). The device B is constructed so as to send back tachyon 2 to A as soon

as it receives tachyon 1 from A. If B has to emit (in its rest-frame) tachyon 2, then 2

must move forward in time w.r.t. device B; that is to say, the world-line BA2 must have a
slope lower than the slope BA′ of the x′-axis (where BA′//x′): this means that A2 must
stay above A′. If the speed of tachyon 2 is such that A2 falls between A′ and A1, it seems
that 2 reaches A (event A2) before the emission of 1 (event A1). This appears to realize

an anti-telephone.

The solution. – First of all, since tachyon 2 moves backwards in time w.r.t. body A,

the event A2 will appear to A as the emission of an antitachyon 2. The observer “ t ”

will see his own device A (able to exchange tachyons) emit successively towards B the

antitachyon 2 and the tachyon 1.

At this point, some supporters of the paradox (overlooking tachyon mechanics, as well

as relations (12)) would say that, well, the description put forth by the observer “t” can be

8

orthodox, but then the device B is no longer working according to the stated programme,

because B is no longer emitting a tachyon 2 on receipt of tachyon 1. Such a statement

would be wrong, however, since the fact that “ t ” observes an “intrinsic emission” at A2
does not mean that “ t′ ” will see an “intrinsic absorption” at B! On the contrary, we
are just in the case considered above, between eqs. (12) and (13): intrinsic emission by
V 2 > c2, where u and V 2 are the velocities of B and 2 w.r.t. body
A, at A2, with u
A, respectively; so that both A and B experience an intrinsic emission (of tachyon 2 or of

·

antitachyon 2) in their own rest frame.

But the tacit premises underlying the “paradox” (and even the very terms in which

·

V 2 > c2, then for tachyon 1 a fortiori u

it was formulated) were “cheating” us ab initio.
u

In fact, Fig.3 makes it clear that, if
V 1 > c2, where u and V 1 are the velocities of
B and 1 w.r.t. body A. Therefore, due to the previous consequences of tachyon mechanics,
observer “t′ ” will see B intrinsically emit also tachyon 1 (or, rather, antitachyon 1).
conclusion, the proposed chain of events does not include any tachyon absorption by B

In

·

(in its rest frame).

For body B to absorb (in its own rest frame) tachyon 1, the world-line of 1 ought to
have a slope higher than the slope of the x′-axis (see Fig.4). Moreover, for body B to
emit (“intrinsically”) tachyon 2, the slope of the of 2 should be lower than the x′-axis’.
In other words, when the body B, programmed to emit 2 as soon as it receives 1, does

actually do so, the event A2 does happen after A1 (cf. Fig.4), as requested by causality.

The moral. – The moral of the story is twofold:

i) one should never mix the descrip-

tions (of one phenomenon) yielded by diﬀerent observers; otherwise —even in ordinary

physics— one would immediately meet contradictions: in Fig.3, e.g., the motion direction

of 1 is assigned by A and the motion-direction of 2 is assigned by B; this is “illegal”;
ii) when proposing a problem about tachyons, one must comply(14) with the rules of
tachyon mechanics(25); this is analogous to complying with the laws of ordinary physics
when formulating the text of an ordinary problem (otherwise the problem in itself will be

“wrong”).

Most of the paradoxes proposed in the literature suﬀered the above shortcomings.

Notice once more that, in the case of Fig.3, neither A nor B regard event A1 as the

cause of event A2 (or vice-versa). In the case of Fig.4, on the other hand, both A and B

consider event A1 to be the cause of event A2: but in this case A1 does chronologically

precede A2 according to both observers, in agreement with the relativistic covariance of

the law of retarded causality.

APPENDIX A: The Stueckelber–Feynman–Sudarshan “Switching Principle”

What follows refers equally well to bradyons and to tachyons. For simplicity, then,

let us ﬁx our attention in this Appendix only to the case of bradyons. Let us start from a

positive-energy particle P travelling forward in time. As well-known, any orthochronows
LT, L↑, transforms it into another particle still endowed with positive energy and motion
forward in time. On the contrary, any antichronous (=non-orthochronous) LT, L↓ =
L↑, will change sign –among the others– to the time-components of all the four-vectors
−
associated with P. Any L↓ will transform P into a particle P’ endowed in particular with
negative energy and motion backwards in time (Fig.5). We are of course assuming that

<<negative-energy objects travelling forward in time do not exist>>. (Elsewhere this

Assumption has been given by us the status of a fundamental postulate).

In other words, SR together with the natural Assumption above, implies that a parti-
cle going backwards in time (G¨odel(29)) (Fig.5) corresponds in the four-momentum space,
Fig.6, to a particle carrying negative energy; and, vice-versa, that changing the energy

sign in the latter space corresponds to changing the sign of time in the former (dual) space.

It is then easy to see that these two paradoxical occurrences (“negative energy” and “mo-

tion backwards in time”) give rise to a phenomenon that any observer will describe in a
quite orthodox way, when they are –as they actually are– simultaneous (Recami(10,14−16)
and refs. therein).

Notice, namely, that: (i) every observer (a macro-object) explores space-time, Fig.5,

in the positive t-direction, so that we shall meet B as the ﬁrst and A as the last event; (ii)

emission of positive quantity is equivalent to absorption of negative quantity, as (

(

) =

(+)

(+); and so on.

·
Let us now suppose (Fig.7) that a particle P’ with negative energy (and, e.g., charge

e), travelling backwards in time, is emitted by A at time t1 and absorbed by B at time

−
t2 < t1. Then, it follows that at time t1 the object A “looses” negative energy and neg-

ative charge, i.e. gains positive energy and positive charge. And that at time t2 < t1

the object B “gains” negative energy and charge, i.e. looses positive energy and charge.

The physical phenomenon here described is nothing but the exchange from B to A of a

particle Q with positive energy, charge +e, and travelling forward in time. Notice that Q

has, however, charges opposite to P’; this means that the present “switching procedure”

(previously called also “RIP”) eﬀects a “charge conjugation” C, among the others. No-

11

tice also that “charge”, here and in the following, means any additive charge; so that our

deﬁnitions of charge conjugation, etc., are more general than the ordinary ones (Recami
and Mignani,(30) hereafter called Review I; Recami(10,15)). Incidentally, such a switching
procedure has been shown to be equivalent to applying the chirality operation γ5 (Recami
and Ziino(31)).

Matter and Antimatter from SR – A close inspection shows that the application of any
antichronous transformation L↓, together with the switching procedure, transforms P into
an object

≡
which is indeed the antiparticle of P. We are saying that the concept of antimatter is a

Q

P

(15)

purely relativistic one, and that, on the basis of the double sign in [c = 1]

±qp2 + m2
0,
the existence of antiparticles could have been predicted already in 1905, exactly with

E =

(16)

the properties they actually exhibited when later discovered, provided that recourse to

the “switching procedure” had been made. We therefore maintain that the points of the

lower hyperboloid sheet in Fig.6 –since they corresponds not only to negative energy but

also to motion backwards in time– represent the kinematical states of the antiparticle P

of the particle P represented by the upper hyperboloid sheet).

Let us stress that the switching procedure not only can, but must be enforced, since

any observer can do nothing but explore spacetime along the positive time direction. That

procedure is an improved translation into a purely relativistic language of the St¨uckelberg–
Feynman(17) “Switching principle”. Together with our Assumption above, it can take the
Negative-energy objects travelling forward in time do not

exist; any negative-energy object P travelling backwards in time can and must be de-

scribed as its antiobject P going the opposite way in space (but endowed with positive

energy and motion forward in time)

and references therein.

Concluding remark of Appendix A – Let us go back to Fig.5. In SR, when based only on

the two ordinary postulates, nothing prevents a priori the event A from inﬂuencing the

event B. Just to forbid such a possibility we introduced our Assumption together with

the Switching procedure. As a consequence, not only we eliminate any particle-motion

12

backwards in time, but we also “predict” and naturally explain within SR the existence

of antimatter.

In the case of tachyons the Switching procedure was ﬁrst applied by Sudarshan and

coworkers(14); see e.g. ref.(15) and refs. therein.

APPENDIX B: Experimental data possibly related to Superluminal motions.

The question of Super-luminal objects or waves [tachyons: a term coined by G.Feinberg]

has a long story, starting perhaps with Lucretius’ De Rerum Natura (cf., e.g., book 4, line

201). Still in pre-relativistic times, let us recall e.g. the papers by A.Sommerfeld (quoted
in refs.(10,33)). In relativistic times, our problem started to be tackled again essentially in
the ﬁfties and sixties, in particular after the papers by E.C.George Sudarshan et al., and

later on by E.Recami, R.Mignani, et al. [who coined the term bradyons for slower-than-

light objects, and rendered the expressions subluminal and Superluminal of popular use

by their works at the beginning of the seventies], as well as by H.C.Corben and others

(to conﬁne ourselves to the theoretical researches). For references, one can check pages
162-178 in ref.(10), where about 600 citations are listed; as well as the large bibliographies
by V.F.Perepelitsa(34) and as the book in ref.(16).
In particular, for the causality prob-
lems one can see refs.(10,15) and references therein, while for a model theory for tachyons
in two dimensions one can be addressed to refs.(10,17). The ﬁrst experiments looking for
tachyons were performed by T.Alv¨ager et al.; some citations about the early experimental
quest for Superluminal objects may be found e.g. in refs.(35).

The subject of tachyons is presently returning after fashion, especially because of the

fact that four diﬀerent experimental sectors of physics seem to indicate the existence of

Superluminal objects. One of such sectors has been already mentioned by us. We wish

to put forth in the following some information (mainly bibliographical) about the exper-

imental results obtained in the other sectors.

Second - Negative Mass-Square Neutrinos – Since 1971 it was known that the experimental

square-mass of muon-neutrinos resulted to be negative (with low statistical signiﬁcance,

but systematically).

If conﬁrmed, this would correspond (within the ordinary, na¨ıve

speed;

approach to relativistic particles) to an imaginary mass and therefore to a Superluminal
in a non-na¨ıve approach,(10) i.e. within a Special Relativity theory extended
to include tachyons [Extended Relativity (ER)], the free tachyon “dispersion relation”
becomes E2

From the theoretical point of view, about the above point see E.Giannetto, G.D.

Maccarrone, R.Mignani and E.Recami: Phys. Lett. B178 (1986) 115-120, and references
therein; see also ref.10 and references therein.

Recent experiments showed that also electron-neutrinos result to have negative mass-

square. See e.g. R.G.H.Robertson et al.: Phys. Rev. Lett. 67 (1991) 957; A.Burrows

et al.: Phys. Rev. Lett. 68 (1992) 3834; Ch.Weinheimer et al.: Phys. Lett. B300

(1993) 210; E.Holtzshuh et al.: Phys. Lett. B287 (1992) 381; H.Kawakami et al.:

Phys. Lett. B256 (1991) 105, and so on. See also the reviews or comments by M.Baldo

Ceolin: “Review of neutrino physics”, invited talk at the “XXIII Int. Symp. on Mul-

tiparticle Dynamics (Aspen, CO; Sept.1993); E.W.Otten: Nucl. Phys. News 5 (1995)

11.

In very recent papers, J.Ciborowski and J.Rembielinski claimed to be able to ex-

plain a crucial experimental detail just by the Superluminal hypothesis (“An explanation

of anomalies in the electron energy spectrum for tritium decay”, Preprint submitted to

HEP97–PA10#744; 1997); while S.Giani (IT, Cern) claimed that, for explaining the ar-

rival times of the neutrinos (emitted by the 1987a supernova) detected by the Monte

Bianco and Kamiokande experiments, Superluminal propagation speeds are in order.

Third: Galactic “Mini-Quasars”, etc.

(Apparent Superluminal expansions observed in-

side quasars, some galaxies, and –as discovered very recently– in some galactic objects,

preliminarily called “mini-quasars”) – Since 1971 in many quasars (and even a few galax-

ies) apparent Superluminal expansions were observed [“Nature”, for instance, dedicated

to those observations a couple of its covers]. Such seemingly Superluminal expansions

were the consequence of the experimentally measured angular separation rates, once it

was taken into account the (large) distance of the sources from the Earth. From the ex-

perimental point of view, it is enough to quote the book “Superluminal Radio Sources”,

ed. by J.A.Zensus and S.Unwin (Cambridge Univ. Press; Cambridge, UK, 1987), and

references therein.

The distance of those “Superluminal sources”, however, it is not well known; or, at

least, the (large) distances usually adopted have been strongly criticized by H.Arp et al.,

who maintain that quasars are much nearer objects: so that all the above-mentioned

data can no longer be easily used to infer (apparent) Superluminal motions. However,

very recently, GALACTIC objects have been discovered, in which apparent Superlumi-

nal expansions occur; and the distance of galactic objects can be more precisely deter-

mined. From the experimental point of view, see in fact the papers by I.F.Mirabel and

L.F.Rodriguez. : “A superluminal source in the Galaxy”, Nature 371 (1994) 46 [with a

15

Nature’s comment, “A galactic speed record”, by G.Gisler, at page 18 of the same issue];

and by S.J.Tingay et al. (20 authors): “Relativistic motion in a nearby bright X-ray

source”, Nature 374 (1995) 141.

From the theoretical point of view, both for quasars and “mini-quasars”, see E.Recami,

A.Castellino, G.D.Maccarrone and M.Rodon`o: “Considerations about the apparent Su-

perluminal expansions observed in astrophysics”, Nuovo Cimento B93 (1986) 119. See
also E.Recami: ref.(10), and cf. R.Mignani and E.Recami: Gen. Relat. Grav. 5 (1974)
In particular, let us recall that a single Superluminal source of light would be ob-
615.

served:

(i) initially, in the phase of “optic boom” (analogous to the acoustic “boom” by

an aircraft that travels with constant super-sonic speed) as an intense, suddenly-appearing

source;

(ii) later on, as a source which splits into TWO objects receding one from the

other with velocity v > 2c [see the quoted refs.].

Fourth: Superluminal motions in Electrical and Acoustical Engineering – The “X-shaped

waves” – This fourth sector is perhaps the most important one. Starting with the pi-

oneering work by H.Bateman, it became slowly known that all the (homogeneous) wave

equations —in a general sense: scalar, electromagnetic and spinor— admit solutions with
subluminal (v < c) group velocities.(36) More recently, also Superluminal (V > c) so-
lutions have been constructed for those homogeneous wave equations, in refs.(37) and
quite independently in refs.(38): in some cases just by applying a Superluminal Lorentz
“transformation”.(10,39)
It has been also shown that the same happens even in the
case of acoustic waves, with the presence in this case of “sub-sonic” and “Super-sonic”
solutions.(40) Particular attention has been called by the circumstance that some of
the new solutions are “undistorted progressive waves” (namely, represent localized, non-

diﬀractive waves). One can expect all such solutions to exist, e.g., also for seismic wave

equations. More intriguingly, we might expect the same to be true in the case of gravi-

tational waves too.

It is interesting to remark that the Super-sonic and Super-luminal solutions forwarded
in refs.(41) —some of them experimentally already realized(41)— appear to be (gener-
ally speaking) X-shaped, just as predicted in 1982 by A.O.Barut, G.D.Maccarrone and
E.Recami in ref.(42); so that now they have been preliminarily called “X-waves”.

On this regard, from the theoretical point of view, let us quote pages 116-117, and
pages 59 (ﬁg.19) and 141 (ﬁg.42), in E.Recami: ref.(10). Even more, see the abovemen-
tioned A.O.Barut, G.D.Maccarrone and E.Recami: “On the shape of tachyons”, Nuovo

Cimento A71 (1982) 509-533; where “X-shaped waves” are predicted and discussed. From

16

the quoted papers it is also clear why the X-shaped waves keeps their form while travel-

ling (non-diﬀractive waves): a property that already resulted of high interest for electrical

and acoustical engineering. New experimental and theoretical work is going on (e.g., by

F.Fontana et al. at the “Pirelli Cavi”, Milan, Italy; and by H.E.Hern´andez F. et al. at

the F.E.E.C. of Unicamp, Campinas, S.P.); let us mention in particular that by P.Saari,

H.S˜onajalg et al. at Tartu, Estonia [see e.g. Opt. Lett. 22 (1977) 310; Laser Phys. 7

(1977) 32].

Very recently, some further important articles appeared. Let us mention in particu-

lar that:

(i) at Tartu (Estonia) they have conﬁrmed the experimentally production of

X-shaped (Superluminal) light waves, in optics: see P.Saari and K.Reivelt: “Evidence

of X-shaped propagation-invariant localized light waves”, appeared in Phys. Rev. Lett.,

Nov.24, 1997;

(ii) simultaneously, (non-truncated) X-shaped beams with ﬁnite total

energy —expected to exist on the basis of ER— were mathematically constructed by

I.Besieris, M.Abdel-Rahman, A.Shaarawi and A.Chatzipetros in the work “Two funda-

mental representations of localized pulse solutions to the scalar wave equation”, to appear

in J. Electromagnetic Waves Appl. (1998).

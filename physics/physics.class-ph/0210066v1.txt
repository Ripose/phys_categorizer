A dipole in a dielectric: Intriguing results and shape dependence

of the distant electric ﬁeld

The ﬁeld of a point electric dipole in an inﬁnite dielectric is obtained by placing

the dipole at the center of a spherical cavity of radius R inside the dielectric and then

letting R → 0. The result disagrees with the elementary answer found in textbooks.

The mathematical and physical reasons for the disagreement are discussed. The

discrepancy is conﬁrmed by the same limiting procedure applied to a uniformly

polarized sphere embedded in the dielectric. We next solve the same problem for a

polarized spheroid immersed in an inﬁnite dielectric and ﬁnd that the asymptotic

potential shows an unexpected shape dependence, even after taking the limit of an

arbitrarily small spheroid. By considering both oblate and prolate spheroids and

taking appropriate limits, we recover either the elementary textbook answer or the

previous result found for the polarized sphere.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Historically, electromagnetism, and particularly electrostatics, has been a rich source of

beautiful mathematical physics problems, most of which are quite standard by now. Yet,

from time to time, a closer look at certain simple and seemingly exhausted problems might

surprise even the experienced practitioner. We start by discussing the elementary problem of

determining the electrostatic ﬁeld produced by a pure (point) dipole embedded in the bulk

of an inﬁnite linear dielectric medium. This problem is solved by two apparently equivalent

methods. The ﬁrst makes use of an elementary argument found in textbooks and the other

consists of putting the dipole at the center of a spherical hole in the dielectric and then

letting the radius of the hole tend to zero. The discrepancy between the results might

surprise the reader as much as it surprised the authors. The discrepancy is corroborated

by the same limiting procedure applied to a uniformly polarized sphere embedded in the

2

dielectric.

Next we solve for the electrostatic ﬁeld of a uniformly polarized spheroid in an inﬁnite

dielectric. This solution is an interesting exercise in mathematical physics involving in a

simple way Legendre functions of the second kind, which are seldom used in the standard

electromagnetism textbooks. We ﬁnd that the asymptotic potential exhibits a shape depen-

dence. By taking appropriate limits, we recover either the elementary textbook answer or

the previous result found for the polarized sphere. The dependence of the electrostatic po-

tential on the shape of the spheroid, even after taking the limit in which the spheroid shrinks

away keeping a ﬁnite dipole moment, is unexpected and to a certain extent non-intuitive.

This physical eﬀect appears to have been overlooked by standard textbooks.

II. FIELD OF A DIPOLE IN A DIELECTRIC

The problem of obtaining the ﬁeld produced by a dipole in a dielectric medium is one

of those elementary problems that is present (solved or proposed) in a variety of textbooks.

The well-known solution is trivial. The physical dipole consists of two opposite point charges

(q and −q) separated by the distance d. Letting d → 0 with qd = p0 gives the pure dipole.

D · da = q establishes that each of the
Because in a linear dielectric medium Gauss’ law
charges q and −q will be screened by polarization charges to q′ = qǫ0/ǫ, the dipole moment

H

will be screened by the same factor, so that the actual (eﬀective) dipole moment is

p = p0

ǫ0
ǫ

.

Φ(r) =

p
4πǫ0

cos θ
r2

,

Equation (1) is the answer found in standard textbooks (see Ref. 1 for example). In other

words, for a point dipole parallel to the z-axis and located at the origin, the electrostatic

potential inside the inﬁnite linear dielectric medium in spherical coordinates (r, θ, ϕ) is

with p given by Eq. (1).

Now let us solve the “same” problem by putting the pure dipole p0 at the center of an

empty spherical hole of radius R cut out of the dielectric medium and then letting R → 0.

It is appropriate to make use of the general solution to Laplace’s equation in spherical

coordinates for problems with azimuthal symmetry.

It is easy to see that the boundary

conditions can be satisﬁed by taking only the ℓ = 1 term of the azimuthally symmetric

general solution, so the electrostatic potential inside the hole is

Φ(1)(r) = Ar cos θ +

(0 < r < R)

,

and the potential outside is

Φ(2)(r) =

p′
4πǫ0

cos θ
r2

.

(r > R)

(3b)

Note that inside the hole the singular term corresponds to the pure dipole singularity with

dipole moment p0, because the dipole is in vacuum. Outside, only the term that decreases
with r is present, with the factor p′ to be determined. By requiring the continuity of the

scalar potential (equivalent to the continuity of the tangential component of the electric

ﬁeld) and of the radial component of the electric displacement vector (D(1) = −ǫ0∇Φ(1) and
D(2) = −ǫ∇Φ(2)) at the boundary r = R, we obtain

The application of the boundary conditions in Eqs. (4) and (5) leads to the equations

According to Eqs. (8) and (9), the electrostatic potential outside the hole is that of a point
dipole in vacuum with eﬀective dipole moment p′ given by Eq. (9). In the limit R → 0, the
dipole potential everywhere except at the origin is given by Eq. (3b) with p′ determined by

Eq. (9). Surprisingly, this eﬀective dipole moment disagrees with the one given in Eq. (1)

by means of the previous elementary argument.

The reason for the discrepancy appears to be the lack of commutativity of two successive

limits. The result (1) corresponds to putting the two opposite charges outside the hole in

the dielectric, letting the radius of the hole tend to zero ﬁrst, and then making the distance

between the charges arbitrarily small, thus creating a dipole at the origin. To obtain the

result (9), we ﬁrst let the distance between the charges tend to zero, creating a point dipole

at the center of the hole, and only later do we make the radius of the hole arbitrarily small.

A physical explanation for the discrepancy is that in the ﬁrst case, but not in the second

case, the charges are always screened by the dielectric.

We might argue that the dipole moment associated with the polarization charges on the

surface of the hole added to p0 leads to a total dipole moment given by Eq. (9), which is

in fact vindicated by an explicit calculation. This argument, however, misses the point.

The surprise comes from the fact that, if only the free dipole moment p0 is considered, its

reduction by the dielectric constant factor does not account for the screening eﬀect due to

the polarization of the medium. This behavior contrasts sharply with that of a point charge

at the center of the hole, whose ﬁeld in the interior of the dielectric is obtained by simply

replacing the free charge q by qǫ0/ǫ in the vacuum ﬁeld.

III. UNIFORMLY POLARIZED SPHERE IN A DIELECTRIC

To check the previous result in Eq. (9) and allow for a generalization in Sec. IV, let us

consider a uniformly polarized sphere (electret) of radius R, with polarization P along the
z axis, P = P0ˆk, surrounded by an inﬁnite dielectric whose dielectric constant is ǫ. The

potential has no singularity inside the sphere, so we have

for the potential inside the sphere, while the potential outside is

Φ(1)(r) = Br cos θ

(0 < r < R)

Φ(2)(r) =

4πǫ0

(r > R)

to obtain

and

2ǫ p′
4πǫ0R3 = −ǫ0B + P0

We now notice that D(1) = −ǫ0∇Φ(1) + P and apply the same boundary conditions as before

B =

p′ =

The resulting electrostatic potential inside the polarized sphere is

Φ(1)(r) =

r cos θ ,

(0 < r < R)

(15a)

P0
2ǫ + ǫ0

and the potential outside is

Φ(2)(r) =

R3P0
2ǫ + ǫ0

cos θ
r2

.

(r > R)

(15b)

If we let R → 0 and P0 → ∞ in such a way that p0 = (4/3)πR3P0 remains ﬁxed, we would

expect to recover the point dipole p0 at the origin embedded in the inﬁnite dielectric. In

such a limit, the potential everywhere except at the origin becomes

Φ(2)(r) =

3ǫ0
2ǫ + ǫ0

1
4πǫ0

p0 cos θ
r2

.

(r > 0)

(16)

This result coincides with the R → 0 limit of the previous problem of the point dipole at

the center of an empty sphere inside the dielectric.

Here, again, the dipole moment of the polarization charges on the spherical surface of

the dielectric leads to the total dipole moment (9). Thus, the ﬁeld inside the dielectric is

obtained from the vacuum ﬁeld by reducing the free dipole moment by a factor that diﬀers

from the screening factor for a point charge.

IV. UNIFORMLY POLARIZED SPHEROID IN A DIELECTRIC

To put the results of Sec. III in a broader context, which will make possible a further

investigation of the origin of the discrepancy encountered above, we will examine a third

“interpolating” problem. Consider a uniformly polarized hole (electret) in the dielectric

medium with the shape of a spheroid (an ellipsoid of revolution).

6

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

The oblate spheroidal coordinates are deﬁned by (see Ref. 2 for example)

with µ ≥ 0, 0 ≤ v ≤ π, 0 ≤ ϕ ≤ 2π, and a a positive real number. The surface of the

spheroid is deﬁned by µ = µ0, while its interior is determined by µ < µ0. It is easy to see

that the surface of the spheroid is given in cartesian coordinates by

where X = a cosh µ0 and Z = a sinh µ0, so that X > Z. The ellipsoid is oblate, that is,

ﬂattened along the z direction.

In terms of the new variables

we can write

with

The surface of the spheroid is now given by ζ = ζ0. Laplace’s equation for the potential is

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

separable in these coordinates,2 and its solution with rotational symmetry about the z axis,

which is acceptable in the present physical circumstances, is

outside the spheroid, where Pℓ is the ℓth Legendre polynomial and Qℓ is the Legendre

function of the second kind of order ℓ. The absence of Qℓ(ξ) is necessary to guarantee the

regularity of Φ on the z axis (ξ = 1).

An inspection of Eq. (17) shows that asymptotically ζ plays the role of a radial coordinate.

More precisely, for large µ, we have ξ ≈ cos θ and ζ ≈ r/a with r, θ spherical coordinates.

This observation strongly suggests that the terms with ℓ = 1 alone will suﬃce to satisfy the

boundary conditions, and accordingly we take

Φ(1)(ξ, ζ) = P1(ξ)

AP1(iζ) + BQ1(iζ)

(ζ < ζ0)

Φ(2)(ξ, ζ) = P1(ξ)

and Q1(iζ) = ζ cot−1 ζ − 1 .

where

It is not diﬃcult to show that for large ζ

Q1(iζ) −→ −

1
3ζ 2 .

Therefore, the correct asymptotic behavior of Φ requires that C = 0. As in the spherical

coordinates case, it is necessary to take B = 0 to avoid unphysical singularities. Indeed,

the ξ-component of the electric ﬁeld associated with the term P1(ξ)Q1(iζ) is proportional
to h−1
ξ ∂[P1(ξ)Q1(iζ)]/∂ξ = a−1(1 − ξ2)1/2(ξ2 + ζ 2)−1/2(ζ cot−1 ζ − 1), which is inﬁnite at
ξ = ζ = 0, that is, at the circumference ρ = a on the xy-plane. Thus, we try to satisfy the

boundary conditions with (the imaginary unit has been absorbed into the coeﬃcient A)

Φ(1)(ξ, ζ) = Aξζ ,

(ζ < ζ0)

and

Φ(2)(ξ, ζ) = Dξ(ζ cot−1 ζ − 1) .

(ζ > ζ0)

The continuity of the potential at the surface of the spheroid yields

Aζ0 = D(ζ0 cot−1 ζ0 − 1) .

The continuity of the normal component of D on the surface of the spheroid demands that

This result is quite unexpected! Our intuition leads us to believe that seen from far away,

it is impossible to tell a uniformly polarized sphere from a uniformly polarized ellipsoid. The

shape independence of the asymptotic potential prevails only for the vacuum (ǫ = ǫ0). For

a dielectric, the asymptotic potential depends on the shape of the dipole distribution near

the origin.

The analysis of the prolate case runs along similar lines. The prolate spheroidal coordi-

nates are deﬁned by2

The surface of the spheroid is deﬁned by µ = µ0, while its interior is determined by µ < µ0.

The surface of the spheroid is again given in cartesian coordinates by Eq. (18) with X =

a sinh µ0 and Z = a cosh µ0, so that Z > X and the spheroid is elongated in the z direction.

In terms of the new variables

we can write

Once again the asymptotic potential exhibits a surprising shape dependence that is absent

only in the case of the vacuum. For a dielectric the asymptotic potential allows us to tell the

diﬀerence between a uniform dipole density distributed within a sphere, an oblate spheroid,

or a prolate spheroid. If a hole in the dielectric is ﬁlled with a uniform charge density, no

such shape dependence is observed. The total induced charge depends only on the internal

free charge and on the dielectric constant.

Note also the striking result that the electric ﬁeld is uniform inside the spheroid because

the potential is of the form Φ(1) = Az in both cases, as Eqs. (26a) and (42) show.

V. LIMITING CASES AND CONCLUSION

Let us deﬁne the screening factor α as the coeﬃcient that multiplies the vacuum asymp-

totic dipole ﬁeld to give the asymptotic dipole ﬁeld in the presence of the dielectric medium.

From Eq. (50) it follows immediately that

The spherical limit is reached by letting η0 ≡ cosh µ0 → ∞ and a → 0 in such a way

that a cosh µ0 = R remains ﬁxed. Then we obtain X = Z = R in Eq. (18) and the spheroid

degenerates into a sphere. If we take into account that for large η0

it is easy to show that

.

Thus our previous result for the uniformly polarized sphere is recovered.

Let us now examine the line dipole limit, reached by letting η0 → 1 or, equivalently,

µ0 → 0. In this limit we have X = 0 and Z = a, so that the ellipsoid (18) reduces to a line

segment (a rod) along the z-axis. If we recall that limx→0 x ln x = 0, we can readily show

that

lim
η0→1

α =

,

and the standard answer (1) is regained.

For the oblate spheroid we can also consider two limiting cases with the help of Eq. (37). If

we let ζ0 → ∞ and a → 0 with aζ0 = R, the spherical limit is reached and α → 3ǫ0/(2ǫ+ ǫ0),

as it should. If ζ0 → 0, the spheroid becomes a “pancake” describing a dipole layer, and

α → 1. This result appears to be of some interest, inasmuch as the presence of the dielectric

does not change the vacuum ﬁeld.

We believe that further discussion of the physical grounds for the discrepancies is neces-

sary. The screening factor α is a measure of the total dipole moment in the presence of the

dieletric relative to the vacuum dipole moment p0. Thus, the dipole moment of the charges

induced on the surface of the hole depends not only on the free dipole moment p0 and the

dielectric constant, but also on the shape of the hole. That the shape dependence persists

in the inﬁnitely small hole limit seems to be related to the singularity of the dipole ﬁeld,

which is stronger than that of the monopole ﬁeld. For a shrinking ﬁnite charge distribution

(monopole), Gauss’ law forbids this eﬀect. The reader might want to generalize the dipole

result for higher multipole moments.

It is suspected that such a shape dependence would manifest itself in the dynamical case,

that is, in the radiation from a point dipole embedded in an inﬁnite dielectric. Such a

phenomenon might be of relevance in condensed matter physics. For instance, it might give

rise to classical eﬀects in the theory of quantum dots.

Abstract

The main purpose of this article is to disseminate among a wide au-
dience of physicists a known result, which is available since a couple of
years to the cognoscenti of diﬀerential forms on manifolds; namely, that
charge conservation implies the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations. This
is the reciprocal statement of one which is very well known among physi-
cists: charge conservation, written in the form of a continuity equation,
follows as a consequence of Maxwell equations. We discuss the conditions
under which charge conservation implies Maxwell equations. The key role
played by the constitutive equations is hereby stressed. The discussion is
based on Helmholtz theorem, according to which a vector ﬁeld is deter-
mined by its divergence and its curl. Green’s functions are also shown to
play a fundamental role. We present all results in three-vector, as well
as in tensorial notation. We employ only those mathematical tools most
physicists are familiar with.

Equations (1) and (2) are called inhomogeneous - or Maxwell equations with
sources -, while (3) and (4) are called homogeneous, or source-free equations.
The four equations constitute a closed system because the couples (D, H) and
(E, B) are related to each other through the so-called “constitutive equations”.
It is however not unusual to stress the fact that the equations with sources are,
to some extent, conceptually diﬀerent from the source-free equations. Indeed,
Eqs.(3) and (4) can be understood as expressing a purely mathematical state-
ment. To see this we start by considering a scalar ﬁeld ϕ(t, x) and a vector ﬁeld
A(t, x), which are continuously diﬀerentiable but otherwise totally arbitrary.
Then we construct the ﬁelds B ≡ ∇ × A and E ≡ −∇ϕ − ∂tA/c. Eq.(3) is then
identically satisﬁed because the divergence of a curl vanishes. If we now take
the curl of E and use the fact that the curl of a gradient vanishes, we see that
Eq.(4) also holds true identically. We conclude that Eqs.(3) and (4) are satisﬁed
by arbitrary ﬁelds, as long as these ﬁelds are constructed as above, starting from
the given ﬁelds ϕ and A. These two equations are therefore not characteristic
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. They can be understood as a mathematical state-
ment telling us that there are ﬁelds, ϕ and A, out of which we can construct
E and B. The electromagnetic nature of these ﬁelds depends on the fact that
they have to satisfy also equations (1) and (2), as long as D = D(E, B) and
H = H(E, B). Equations (1) and (2) are the ones possessing a truly physical
content. They are the ones which contain the sources that produce the ﬁeld.
It is the particular way in which these sources are related to the ﬁelds, what
makes up the physical content of these equations.

Let us now turn to Maxwell equations as they are often written in covariant

form:

4π
c
∂µFνλ + ∂νFλµ + ∂λFµν = 0.

∂µF µν =

jν,

(5)

(6)

Here again, starting from an arbitrary four-vector Aµ(x) we may deﬁne an
antisymmetric tensor Fµν ≡ ∂µAν − ∂νAµ. It is easy to see that this tensor
identically satisﬁes the homogeneous equation (6). As before, if our Aµ has

2

to describe an electromagnetic ﬁeld, then it has to satisfy the inhomogeneous
equation ∂µ∂µAν − ∂ν∂µAµ = 4πjν/c, which is another form of Eq.(5).

Summarizing, we can say that the homogeneous Maxwell equations can be
considered as entailing a mathematical statement about the nature of the ﬁelds
E and B, or -correspondingly - about the tensor Fµν . The inhomogeneous
Maxwell equations in turn are the ones possessing physical content. We must
postulate that the electromagnetic ﬁeld has to satisfy them. Now, all these
things are very well known. What seems to be not so very well known is the
fact that the inhomogeneous equations by themselves are also not characteristic
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Indeed, suppose we are given a scalar function
ρ(t, r) and a vector function j(t, r), both of which go to zero suﬃciently rapidly
as r → ∞, and being such that they satisfy the equation

Then there exist vector ﬁelds D(t, r) and H(t, r) satisfying the inhomoge-

neous Maxwell equations

∂tρ + ∇ · j = 0.

∇ · D = ρ
∇ × H = j + ∂tD.

(7)

(8)

(9)

The existence of D and H can be proved by explicit construction. Such a
construction rests on Helmholtz theorem [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], which is discussed below.
For now, it suﬃces to say that - loosely speaking - “a vector ﬁeld is determined
by its divergence and its curl”. Thus, according to Helmholtz theorem, Eq.(8)
can be solved for D (though the solution is not unique) when ρ is given. From
equations (8) and (7) we see that ∇·(∂tD + j) = 0. Applying Helmholtz theorem
again we can show that there is a ﬁeld H whose curl is ∂tD + j. This is equation
(9). Note that we have written the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations in MKS
units, which are the convenient units for what follows.

We see then that the continuity equation (7) entails the inhomogeneous
Maxwell equations. The continuity equation expresses the conservation of some-
thing. This something must not necessarily be electric charge. It could be mass
as well, or any other quantity - like probability, for instance. We are thus led to
conclude that the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations are also not characteristic
of electromagnetism. They hold true whenever something is conserved. Putting
things this way we bring to the fore the fundamental role played by the consti-
tutive equations, D = D(E, B) and H = H(E, B), whatever their precise form
might be. They constitute the link between the homogeneous and the inhomo-
geneous Maxwell equations. It is this link what turns the four equations into a
closed system. Neither the inhomogeneous nor the homogeneous equations by
themselves are characteristic of electromagnetism. They must be linked to one
another in order to conform a closed system of equations that is characteristic
of electromagnetic phenomena.

In the following section we discuss Helmholtz theorem. Although this theo-
rem can be found in several textbooks and articles, for our purposes it is useful

3

to present it in a form which brings to the fore its connection with Green’s
functions.

2 Helmholtz theorem

Here we discuss Helmholtz theorem by following an approach which is slightly
diﬀerent from the one presented in several textbooks. Helmholtz theorem states
that a vector ﬁeld v is completely determined by giving its divergence and its
n · v, at the boundary of the domain
curl, together with its normal component,
where such a vector ﬁeld is to be determined. For physical applications it is
natural to take as “boundary” an inﬁnitely distant surface and v vanishing there.
Helmholtz theorem then says that we can write v in terms of two potentials, U
and C, in the form

b

v(x) = ∇U (x) + ∇ × C(x),
(10)
where U and C can be expressed in terms of the divergence and the curl of
v(r), respectively. Now, put in this form, Helmholtz’s theorem might appear
as a result that is rather awkward to prove. Let us thus try to lay bare what
motivates it. To this end, consider the following two vector identities, in which
the Laplacian ∇2 appears:

∇· (∇U ) = ∇2U

∇ × (∇ × C) = ∇ (∇ · C) − ∇2C.

Add to these relations the equation satisﬁed by a Green function G(x, y),

on which we impose the condition that it vanishes at inﬁnity:

By means of G(x, y) we can introduce U and C as “potentials” associated

with two given “densities”, ρ and j, through

Z
We assume that ρ and j vanish at inﬁnity. The potentials then satisfy

∇2G(x, y) = δ3(x − y),

G(x, y) = −

∇2U (x) = ρ(x),
∇2C(x) = −j(x).
∇ · j(x) = 0 ⇒ ∇ · C(x) = 0.

The validity of Eqs.(17,18) follows directly from the deﬁnitions given by
Eqs.(15,16), together with Eqs.(13,14). In order to see that ∇ · j(x) = 0 implies
that C(x) is divergenless we need a little more ellaborated calculation:

(23)

In the last step - which resulted from an integration by parts - the volume
integral was replaced by a surface integral using the divergence - or Stokes -
theorem. Such a surface integral vanishes when the volume of integration goes
to inﬁnity, because j has been assumed to vanish at inﬁnity. The second term
vanishes because of the requirement ∇ · j = 0.

From Eqs.(11) and (12) together with (17,18,19), we see that

This suggests us to deﬁne a ﬁeld v = ∇U + ∇ × C. Such a ﬁeld satisﬁes

∇· (∇U ) = ρ(x),
∇ × (∇ × C) = j(x).

∇ · v = ρ(x), ∇ × v = j(x).

This way we arrive naturally at the following statement: if we are given the
divergence ρ(x) and the curl j(x) of a vector ﬁeld v(x), then we can write this
ﬁeld as v = ∇U + ∇ × C, where U and C are given in terms of ρ and j by
Eqs.(15) and (16). In order to see that ρ and j uniquely determine v, it suﬃces
to show that when both the divergence and the curl of a ﬁeld vanish, then the
ﬁeld itself vanishes identically. This follows from what we have done so far.
Indeed, we have shown that the following equation holds true identically:

v(x) = −∇x

G(x, y)∇ · v(y)d3y

+∇x ×

G(x, y)∇ × v(y)d3y

, (27)

(cid:18)Z

(cid:19)
with the Green’s function G(x, y) satisfying Eqs.(13,14). Hence, if ∇ · v = 0
and ∇ × v = 0, then v = 0. We conclude that given two ﬁelds, v1 and v2,
having the same divergence and curl, they must in fact be the same ﬁeld. This,
because their diﬀerence v = v1 − v2 vanishes identically, as a consequence of
∇ · v = 0 and ∇ × v = 0.

(cid:18)Z

(cid:19)

Finally, let us ﬁrst note that Eq.(27) holds for Green’s functions other than
the one deﬁned in Eq.(14). Indeed, the only property we need to assume about
the Green function G(x, y) is that it be of the form G(x − y). This is true
anyway, whenever G(x, y) fulﬁlls Eq.(13). As to the ﬁeld v, it has been assumed
to vanish at inﬁnity. In fact, it suﬃces to assume that it vanishes faster than
1/r for large r. Note also that if we prescribe only the divergence ∇ · v = ρ(x)
of a ﬁeld, then what we can deduce from this sole condition is that

v(x) = −∇x

G(x, y)∇ · v(y)d3y

+ ∇x × Z(x),

(28)

with Z(x) arbitrary. If we instead prescribe only the curl ∇ × v = j(x) of a
ﬁeld, then we have

v(x) = ∇x ×

G(x, y)∇ × v(y)d3y

with V (x) arbitrary.

3 Maxwell equations and Helmoltz theorem

We have discussed Helmholtz theorem in the framework of R3. That is, the
vector ﬁelds we have considered are of the form v(x). However, all the results
we have obtained so far remain valid if we assume these ﬁelds to depend on
a set of additional parameters. They can be assumed to have been there all
the way, but without having been shown explicitly. Let us denote one of these
parameters as t. For the moment, we do not assign to it any physical meaning.
Of course, the notation anticipates that it will be identiﬁed in due course with
the time variable.

Let us start by assuming that we are given the divergence ρ of a ﬁeld, which
is a function not only of position but of the parameter t as well, which we now
make explicit, i.e., ρ = ρ(t, r). Let our boundary condition be such that ρ
vanishes at spatial inﬁnity. Helmholtz theorem states that there is a ﬁeld, call
it D, satisfying

∇ · D(t, r) = ρ(t, r).

(30)

As we have seen, the ﬁeld D(t, r) is explicitly given by

D(t, r) = −∇r

d3r1 + ∇r × Z(t, r),

ρ(t, r1)
4π |r − r1|
with Z an arbitrary ﬁeld that we are free to put equal to zero, if we want.
We stress that t plays, in all of this, only the role of a parameter that can be
appended to the ﬁelds, without having any dynamical meaning. The ﬁeld D(t, r)
is required to satisfy only one condition we have put upon it, i.e., ∇ · D(t, r) =
ρ(t, r). The curl of D has been left unspeciﬁed, or else set equal to zero.

(31)

Z

Consider now a ﬁeld j(t, r) depending on the same parameter t as ρ does.

Assume next that ρ(t, r) and j(t, r) satisfy a continuity equation:

By using Eq.(30) the continuity equation can be written as

∂tρ + ∇ · j = 0.

∇ · (∂tD + j) = 0.

(32)

(33)

The divergenless vector ∂tD + j can thus be taken as being the curl of a
Indeed, according to what we have seen before, the equation

ﬁeld H(t, r).
∇ × H = j + ∂tD can be solved as

Z

(34)

H(t, r) = ∇r ×

d3r1 + ∇rV (t, r).

j(t, r1) + ∂tD(t, r1)
4π |r − r1|
As long as we do not specify ∇ · H the function V remains undetermined.
In any case, the Maxwell equations ∇ · D = ρ and ∇ × H − ∂tD = j hold true
as a consequence of the continuity equation and Helmholtz theorem. However,
these equations are not enough to determine the dynamics of the ﬁelds D and
H, even though we may ascribe to t the meaning of time. This must be so
because - to begin with - the continuity equation alone does not entail enough
information about the dynamics of ρ and j. But even in case we were provided
with the complete dynamics of ρ and j, from a physical point of view it is clear
that some assumptions must be made concerning the properties of the medium
(e.g., “space-time”) in order to ﬁx the dynamics of the electromagnetic ﬁelds
that will eventually propagate in such a medium.

Nonetheless, let us pursue a little bit further the mathematical approach
suggested by Helmholtz theorem. The potentials U and C in terms of which we
deﬁned the ﬁeld v(x) read here

ϕ(t, r) =

A(t, r) =

d3r1,

ρ(t, r1)
4π |r − r1|
j(t, r1) + ∂tD(t, r1)
4π |r − r1|

d3r1,

Z

(35)

(36)

respectively, and we have that D(t, r) = −∇rϕ(t, r) + ∇r × Z(t, r) and H(t, r) =
∇r × A(t, r) + ∇rV (t, r). We obtain then, from Eq.(35),

D(t, r) =

1
4π

Z

d3r1

ρ(t, r1)
|r − r1|2

(r − r1)
|r − r1|

+ ∇r × Z(t, r).

(37)

For the special case of a point-like charge moving along the curve r0(t) we

put ρ(t, r) = qδ(r − r0(t)) and the above expression reduces to

D(t, r) =

q
4π |r − r0(t)|2

r − r0(t)
|r − r0(t)|

+ ∇r × Z(t, r).

(38)

7

According to Eqs.(37) or (38) the ﬁeld D(t, r) at time t entails an instan-
taneous Coulomb ﬁeld produced by a continuous charge distribution ρ, or else
by a point-like charge q. Such a result would correspond to an instantaneous
response of the ﬁeld to any change suﬀered by the charge distribution. That
would be in contradiction with the ﬁnite propagation-time needed by any sig-
nal. Whatever the ﬁeld Z(t, r) might be, it must contain a similar instantaneous
contribution that cancels the former one, if we want the present approach to
bear any physical interpretation. Such an issue has been discussed and cleared,
in the case of the complete set of Maxwell equations, by showing that both the
longitudinal and the transverse parts of the electric ﬁeld contain instantaneous
contributions, which turn out to cancel each other [8]. Note also that by taking
Z equal to zero in Eq.(44) we have ∇×D = 0 in our case, which is not what hap-
pens when D has to satisfy (together with H) the complete system of Maxwell
equations. In any event, as we have already stressed, it is necessary to add some
additional information to the one derived from the continuity equation, in order
to ﬁx the dynamics of the ﬁelds. We do this in the following form. Instead of
taking the potentials ϕ and A as given by Eqs.(35) and (36), we assume them
as additional quantities, out of which we deﬁne the ﬁelds E and B through

E(t, r) = −∇rϕ(t, r) − ∂tA(t, r),
B(t, r) = ∇r × A(t, r).

These ﬁelds obey then the homogeneous Maxwell equations identically:

Side by side to these two Maxwell equations we write the inhomogeneous

ones:

We stress once again that - up to this point - the homogeneous and the
inhomogeneous equations are independent from one another. We may connect
them through some constitutive equations, like, e.g.,

(39)
(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)
(44)

(45)

(46)

∇ · B = 0
∇ × E + ∂tB = 0.

∇ · D = ρ
∇ × H = j + ∂tD.

D = εE,

H = µ

−1B.

8

These equations are usually assumed to describe a linear medium of electrical
permittivity ε and magnetic permeability µ. A particular case of such a medium

is vacuum, and the system of equations, Eqs.(41, 42, 43, 44), that arises out of
a connection like the one given by Eqs.(45, 46) is what we know as the complete
system of Maxwell equations.

Without connecting (D, H) with (E, B) through some constitutive equa-
tions, we have no closed system. The equations that we have written down for
(D, H), that is Maxwell equations with sources, can also be written down for
a ﬂuid, for example. We can expect that any conclusion that can be derived in
the realm of electrodynamics from the equations ∇ · D = ρ and ∇ × H = j + ∂tD
without coupling them to the source-free Maxwell equations, will have a corre-
sponding result in the realm of ﬂuid dynamics. This assertion can be illustrated
by two examples: 1) A ﬂuid having a point-like singularity in its density ρ
(one can achieve this approximately, by using an appropriate sink): one obtains
in this case a velocity-ﬁeld obeying a law that is mathematically identical to
Coulomb’s law [7]. 2) A ﬂuid where a so-called vortex tube appears (tornadoes
and whirl-pools are associated phenomena), in which case - after approximating
the vortex-tube by a line singularity - one obtains a velocity-ﬁeld through an
expression which is mathematically identical to the Biot-Savart law [7].

4 Tensorial formulation

The derivation of the inhomogeneous Maxwell equations as a consequence of
charge conservation is nothing new [9]. It follows as a direct application of a
theorem of de Rahm for diﬀerential forms [9, 10]. According to this theorem,
given a four-vector jα(x) for which a continuity equation holds, i.e., ∂αjα =
0, there exists an antisymmetric tensor F αβ = −F βα fulﬁlling ∂αF αβ = jβ.
As we said before, this last equation is nothing but the tensorial form of the
inhomogeneous Maxwell equations, Eqs.(43) and (44). Now, the tensor F αβ is
not always derivable from a vector Aα. In order to be derivable from Aα in
the form F αβ = ∂αAβ − ∂βAα, it must satisfy the equation ∂αF βγ + ∂βF γα +
∂γF αβ = 0. This is the tensorial form of the homogeneous Maxwell equations,
Eqs.(41,42). In other words, given jα and Aα, with jα satisfying a continuity
(1) and F αβ
equation, we may introduce two antisymmetric tensors, F αβ
(2) . The ﬁrst
one can be determined so as to satisfy ∂αF αβ
(1) = jβ, according to de Rahm’s
theorem. The second tensor, deﬁned through F αβ
(2) ≡ ∂αAβ − ∂βAα, satisﬁes
∂αF βγ
(2) = 0 identically. In order that these two equations do
conform a closed system, i.e., the total system of Maxwell equations, we need
to connect F αβ
(2) through some constitutive relation. In the following
we ellaborate on all this, but without employing the tools of diﬀerential forms
on manifolds, which - in spite of their usefulness - cannot be said yet to be part
of the lore of physics.

(1) with F αβ

(2) + ∂βF γα

(2) + ∂γF αβ

It is indeed not necessary to rest on de Rham’s theorem and the theory of
diﬀerential forms on manifolds, in order to derive the foregoing conclusions in
tensorial form. One could start with the tensorial form of Helmholtz theorem
[2, 3, 4] and go-ahead with a similar reasoning as the one we have followed in

9

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

the preceding sections. We shall however proceed by explicitly constructing a
tensor fulﬁlling our requirements.

Let us thus start by assuming that we are given a vector ﬁeld jα. We want

to show that there is an antisymmetric tensor F αβ fulﬁlling

Note ﬁrst that from Eq.(47) and the antisymmetry of F αβ it follows that jβ

must satisfy the continuity equation:

∂αF αβ = jβ.

∂βjβ = 0.

We now demonstrate the existence of the tensor F αβ by explicit construction.

To this end, we consider the Green function G (x, x′) satisfying

′
∂µ∂µG (x, x
Given G (x, x′) and jα we introduce the potential Aµ(x) as

Let us now take the four-divergence of the above deﬁned tensor F µν (x):

∂µF µν (x) =

[∂µ∂µG (x, x

′
) jν(x

′
) − ∂µ∂νG (x, x

) jµ(x

′
)] d4x

.

(53)

Because G (x, x′) satisﬁes Eq.(49), the ﬁrst integral in Eq.(53) is equal to
jν(x). As for the second integral, in order to show that it is zero we do as
follows. Because G (x, x′) satisﬁes Eq.(49), it must be a function of (x − x′), so
that ∂µG (x, x′) = −∂′
µ ≡ ∂/∂x′µ. We use this property and
integrate by parts the second term in (53); at the same time we replace the ﬁrst
term by jν(x):

µG (x, x′), where ∂′

Now, just as in the three-dimensional case, where the divergence of a ﬁeld
did not determine the ﬁeld uniquely (see Eq.(28)), by subjecting F µν to the sole
condition of fulﬁlling Eq.(47) we do not ﬁx F µν completely. Indeed, the tensor

Eq.(47):

Here, ǫµνρσ is the totally antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor (in fact, a tensor
density). The four-divergences of K µν and F µν are the same because, due to
the antisymmetry of ǫµνρσ and the symmetry of partial derivatives like ∂µ∂ρ,
we have

Hence, we obtain Maxwell equation with sources:

ǫµνρσ (∂µ∂ρBσ − ∂µ∂σBρ) ≡ 0.

together with the identity ∂µFνλ + ∂ν Fλµ + ∂λFµν ≡ 0, which follows from the
F µν = ǫµναβFαβ/2
deﬁnition of F µν , as given in Eq.(51). Introducing the dual
of the tensor Fαβ we can write the former identity in the form

∂αK αβ = jβ,

F µν = 0.

Eqs.(60) and (61) are Maxwell equations in tensorial form. As we said before,
they constitute a closed system as long as K αβ and F µν become related to each
other by some constitutive equations. A general, linear algebraic, relationship
between these tensors has the form [11]

where χαβρσ is called the constitutive tensor. It has the following symmetry
properties: χαβρσ = −χβαρσ = −χαβσρ = χρσαβ. In three-dimensional notation
the components of K αβ are D and H, whereas those of F µν are E and B. For
free-space, the only nonzero components of χαβρσ have the values ε0 and 1/µ0,
corresponding to the electrical permittivity ε0 and magnetic permeability µ0 of
the vacuum.

The properties of the medium can be speciﬁed through an equation like (62),
as well as by introducing some other quantities that describe the polarization
and magnetization of the medium. In three-vector notation these quantities are
the vectors P and M, respectively. Their relation to (D, H) and (E, B) is given,
in the simplest case, by

This choice corresponds to the assignment Ei = F0i for the electric ﬁeld, and
Bi = −ǫijkFjk/2 for the magnetic ﬁeld (Latin indices run from 1 to 3). By relat-
ing M αβ to K αβ through K αβ = F αβ − M αβ we can rewrite the inhomogeneous
Maxwell equation (60) as

∂αF αβ = jβ + ∂αM αβ.

(66)

Written in this form, the inhomogeneous Maxwell equation makes the magnetization-
polarization tensor M αβ appear as a source of the electromagnetic ﬁeld F αβ ≡
∂µAν (x) − ∂νAµ(x). The constitutive equations are given in this case as a
connection between M αβ and F αβ [12]. At any rate, one has to make some hy-
pothesis concerning the electromagnetic properties of the medium - be it vacuum
or any other kind of medium - in order to obtain the closed system of Maxwell
equations. The simplest assumption is to attribute to the medium the prop-
erty of reacting locally and instantaneously to the presence of a ﬁeld. It could
be, however, that such an assumption describes reality as a ﬁrst approximation
only.

Finally, we want to stress the central role played by the Green function
G(x, x′). We assumed this function to satisfy Eq.(49), an equation entailing the
velocity of light. One possible solution of (49) is given by the retarded Green
function

′
G(x, x

) =

4π |r − r′|

δ(t − t

− |r − r′

| /c).

(67)

This is the solution of Eq.(49) to which we ascribe physical meaning. By using
it in Eq.(50) we are actually prescribing how the source jµ(x′) at a space-time
point x′ gives rise to an electromagnetic ﬁeld Aµ(x) at a distant point x; a ﬁeld
that virtually acts upon a second charge or current density that is located at such
a distant point. There is therefore a fundamental piece of information concerning

12

the electromagnetic properties of space-time that is already contained in the
Green function, be it given through the special form of G(x, x′), as in Eq.(67),
or through the equation it has to satisfy, e.g., Eq.(49).

5 Summary and Conclusions

We showed that starting from charge conservation one can arrive at equations
which are mathematically identical to Maxwell equations with sources. These
equations are therefore tightly linked to a general statement telling us that
something is conserved. Consider anything - charge, matter, or whatever - that
is contained inside an arbitrary volume. Consider also that this thing is in a
quantity that changes with time.
If the change is exclusively due to a ﬂow
through the volume’s boundary, a continuity equation holds true. Then, as a
consequence of it, a pair of Maxwell-like equations must be fulﬁlled by some
auxiliary ﬁelds, which take the role ascribed to D and H in Maxwell equations.
That Maxwell equations with sources follow from charge conservation is a
mathematical fact that has been known since a couple of years [9], although it is
not mentioned in standard textbooks of electromagnetism. Maxwell equations
with sources involve the ﬁelds D and H, whereas the source-free equations
involve the ﬁelds E and B. It is through some constitutive equations connecting
(D, H) with (E, B) that we obtain a closed system, i.e., the complete system of
Maxwell equations. The constitutive equations express, in some way or another,
the underlying properties of the medium where the ﬁelds act or are produced.
From this perspective, the Maxwell equations entail besides charge conservation
some properties of the medium, yet to be unraveled. These properties are
eﬀectively described, in the simplest case, through the permittivity ε and the
permeability µ of the medium. The ﬁrst one refers to electrical, the second
one to magnetic, properties of the medium, be it vacuum or any other one.
It is just when the equations for (D, H) together with those for (E, B) do
conform a closed system, that we can derive a wave equation for these ﬁelds.
The velocity of wave propagation is then given by c = (εµ)−1/2, the velocity
of light. This must be in accordance with the assumptions we make when
choosing a physically meaningful Green function.
It is remarkable that the
velocity of light can be decomposed in terms of a product of two independent
parameters. However, the development of physics has led us to see c as a
fundamental constant of Nature, instead of ε and µ. Nevertheless, currently
discussed and open questions related to accelerated observers, Unruh radiation,
self-force on a charge, magnetic monopoles and the like, might well require an
approach where the role of c recedes in favor of quantities like ε and µ. Maxwell
equations, when written in the - by now - most commonly used Gaussian units,
do not include but the single constant c, hiding so ε and µ from our view.
These last two constants might well be key pieces that remain buried under the
beauty of a uniﬁed theory of electromagnetic phenomena, which is the version
of electrodynamics that we know and use today. A version that should not be
considered as a closed chapter in the book of classical physics.

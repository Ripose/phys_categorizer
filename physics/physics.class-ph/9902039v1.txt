1 Introduction

One of the common problems in electrostatics is the determination of electric
ﬁeld or potential in the presence of a surface distribution of charges. The
knowledge of the discontinuity in the electric ﬁeld across charged surfaces
is useful in solving boundary value problems in electrostatic. Gauss’s law
allows us to write down a result directly. According to Gauss law the dis-
continuity of the normal electric ﬁeld across a surface charge density σ is
4πσ (in CGS units)[1]. Another important result is the discontinuity of the
electrostatic potential across a dipolar layer with the dipoles pointing normal
to the surface. In this case[2] δΨ = 4πPz where Ψ is the potential and Pz is
the dipole surface density.

In this paper we study the electric ﬁeld produced by a ﬂat surface, in vac-
uum, having general (lth, mth) multipole surface density and give expressions
for the discontinuity in the normal and tangential electric ﬁeld. We show
that the discontinuity in the normal electric ﬁeld is given by

2 Dimensional Analysis & Covariance

2.1 Deﬁnition of the problem.

Consider a surface at z = 0 charged with (lth, mth) multiples whose surface
density is ql,m(x, y). Thus, ql,m(x, y)δxδy is the strength of the (lth, mth)
multipole located at the point (x, y) on the surface. If ,for example, ql,m(x, y)
represents a unit multipolar charge at the origin then ql,m(x, y) = δ(x)δ(y)
producing a potential given by

Ψ =

4π
2l + 1

Yl,m(θ, ϕ)
rl+1

l,

(l

To fully characterize the surface charge all the multipole density functions
must be given (recall that l = 0, 1, 2, ... and m =
1), l)
. For example, for a surface with ‘regular’ charge density, given by σ(x, y),
the ql,m’s are as follows: q0,0(x, y) = σ(x, y)/√4π and ql,m(x, y) = 0 for
higher multiples. These multipole moments give rise to an electric ﬁeld above
and below the surface. The purpose of this paper is to ﬁnd expressions for
the discontinuity of the normal ﬁeld and potential in terms of ql,m(x, y).
Thus, for instance, in the example given above we would expect to ﬁnd that
δEz(x, y)
σ(x, y) where Ez is the normal component of the
∝
electric ﬁeld.

2.2 The permissible operators, their transformation

rules and dimensions.

In order to ﬁnd expressions for the discontinuity of the ﬁeld we use covariance
and dimensional analysis. We start by stating all the operations that can be
performed on ql,m(x, y) together with their transformation rule under rotation
and their dimensions. Using these we show that there is only one possible
form for the expression, up to an additional multiplicative factor, for the
discontinuity of the ﬁeld which is both covariant and dimensionally correct.
When the system is rotated by an angle α around the ˆz axis we note that
eimαql,m (see Appendix A). The potential
ql,m transforms according to ql,m →
Ψ is a scalar under rotation. Next, any expression for the ﬁelds discontinuity
must depend locally on ql,m(x, y) as the ﬁeld near the surface (i.e. E(x, y, z
→
0±) ) is determined mostly by the presence of charge distribution at the
vicinity of the point (x, y, z = 0).

The ﬁrst operators that come to mind are multiplication by x and
\

or y.
These operators, however, are not permissible since their use would break the
translational symmetry that is supposed to hold. The only operators that
are both local and translational invariant are ∂/∂x and ∂/∂y. However, each
of these operators separately has no deﬁnite transformation under rotation
around the ˆz axis. Operators which do have deﬁnite transformation rules
are easily constructed from these. Consider the operators ∂
±
i∂/∂y . When the coordinate system is rotated around the ˆz axis by an
angle α to form a new coordinate system- (x
) the newly deﬁned operators
transform according to (see Appendix A) ∂
. Note also that the
∂+ is a scalar in this sense and is nothing but the two-dimensional
operator ∂
Laplacian (which can also be written as ∂
commutes).
We now turn to the transformation rules for the electric ﬁeld. Obviously,
the component of the ﬁeld along the ˆz axis acts as a scalar under the rotation.
As for the tangential components we again construct new ﬁelds deﬁned by

2.3 Covariant expression for the discontinuity in the

normal electric ﬁeld Ez.

We start with ql,m(x, y) which transforms like eimα. To ﬁnd the discontinuity
in Ez(x, y) we operate with ∂+ a total number of M times and with ∂
a
total number of N times to get

3 Determination of al,m and bl,m.

In this section we actually resolve the problem of ﬁnding the discontinuity
of the ﬁelds across a multipolar layer. This time however, the exact math-
ematical expressions are derived together with the required multiplicative
factor.

3.1 Fourier Decomposition of Spherical Harmonics Mo-

ments.

Let Φl,m(r, θ, ϕ) denote the potential due to a localized (l, m)-moment with
unit strength. Thus [3],

Φl,m(r, θ, ϕ) =

4π
2l + 1

Yl,m(θ, ϕ)

The total potential, Ψlm(x, y, z), is then given by a superposition of all the
contributions from the surface, namely

The unit multipole potential may be rewritten in terms of its Fourier
transform over the (x, y) plane. Since Φlm is singular at the origin, the plane
wave expansion for the upper hemisphere (z > 0) may be diﬀerent from
that for the lower hemisphere (z < 0). To make this point clear consider
for example the case of a dipole at the origin pointing in the ˆz direction.
Here Φ1,0(x, y, z0) =
z0) so that the expansion of Φ for the
upper hemisphere diﬀers in sign from the expansion for the lower hemisphere.
Therefore, the plane wave expansion for Φlm should generally be written as

4 Summary

In this paper we derived expressions for the electrostatic ﬁeld discontinuity
across a ﬂat surface in vacuum, having general (lth, mth) multipole surface
charge density. We showed that dimensional analysis and the principle of
covariance alone are suﬃce to determine the form of the expression. The
exact expressions for the ﬁeld discontinuity were then derived mathematically
and were shown to conﬁrm with our early prediction. These expressions are

It is interesting to note how these expressions can be extended to the
electrodynamic case (especially to the discontinuity of the magnetic ﬁeld).
To give the reader a sense of the subtleties that arise when considering the
electrodynamic case we point out that, here, further complication arises as
there is an additional parameter that must be taken into account, namely k0,

10

the wave number. The arguments that led us earlier to a unique form for the
discontinuity relation are no longer valid. Instead, we must now incorporate
the presence of k0 into the expressions in a covariant form. This procedure,
however, is not uniquely determined as is shown by the following argument:
The operator (∂+)N must now be replaced by an operator that has similar
dimension, transforms as (∂+)N and may include k0 as an additional param-
iϕ)
eter. The general operator that obeys these restrictions is PN (∂+, k0e−
where PN (x, y) is a general two-dimensional polynomial of degree N and
, k0e+iϕ)
ϕ is T an−
where QN (x, y) is yet another two dimensional polynomial. Covariance and
dimensional analysis alone cannot yield the coeﬃcients of PN and QN .

)N should be replaced by QN (∂

1(y/x). Similarly, (∂

Yet another interesting question is how does the discontinuity of the ﬁelds
depends (if any) on the curvature of the surface. Recall that the discontinuity
in the normal electric ﬁeld due to a surface charge density, as well as the
discontinuity in the potential due to a surface dipolar density does not depend
on the curvature of the surface. One might then carelessly conclude that
for higher multipolar densities this is the case too. However, the existence
of the diﬀerential operators in Eq.(23), which do not appear at (l, m) =
(0, 0) and (1, 0), might suggest that for higher multiples the curvature does
appear. We conjecture that the curvature does enter in the form of a covariant
diﬀerentiation which replaces the ∂

operators.

Using the properties of Yl,m() which depends on ϕ only through eimϕ we have

ql,mYl,m(θ, ϕ) = q′l,mYl,m(θ, ϕ)e−

which shows that q′l,m must be given by

q′l,m = ql,meimα

B Derivation of ˜Φ±l,m(kx, ky).
In this section we show that ˜Φ±lm(kx, ky) as given by Eq.(15) is indeed the
Fourier transform of Φlm(x, y, z = 0). The Fourier transform of Φlm over the
x-y plane may be calculated straighforwardly by using the following deﬁnite
integral[4]

The radiation dynamics of a dipole antenna embedded in a Photonic Crystal are modeled by an
initially excited harmonic oscillator coupled to a non–Markovian bath of harmonic oscillators repre-
senting the colored electromagnetic vacuum within the crystal. Realistic coupling constants based
on the natural modes of the Photonic Crystal, i.e., Bloch waves and their associated dispersion
relation, are derived. For simple model systems, well-known results such as decay times and emis-
sion spectra are reproduced. This approach enables direct incorporation of realistic band structure
computations into studies of radiative emission from atoms and molecules within photonic crystals.
We therefore provide a predictive and interpretative tool for experiments in both the microwave and
optical regimes.

I. INTRODUCTION

Photonic crystals (PCs) have been the subject of in-
tensive research over the past decade [1]. These are fab-
ricated periodic dielectric arrays that employ a combi-
nation of (i) Mie scattering from individual elements of
the array, and (ii) Bragg scattering from the periodic lat-
tice, to induce a band structure for photon propagation.
This band structure is, in many ways, analogous to elec-
tronic band structure in a semiconductor. Through a
judicious selection of materials and of the periodicity of
the lattice, the photonic dispersion relation and the as-
sociated electromagnetic (EM) mode structure of a PC
can be adapted to a variety of device applications. The
most dramatic modiﬁcation of the photon dispersion oc-
curs when the linear propagation of a photon in a PC
is prohibited in all directions for a range of frequencies,
giving rise to a complete photonic band gap (PBG).

The radiative dynamics of an optically active material
placed within or near a PC can be dramatically modiﬁed
from free space. This is a result of the “colored” electro-
magnetic reservoir provided by the solutions to the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld equations within a PC. In the optical
domain, theoretical studies of atomic transitions coupled
to the EM modes of a PC with an optical PBG predict
a number of novel quantum optical phenomena. These
phenomena include: the suppression or enhancement of
spontaneous emission and the associated fractional lo-
calization of light near radiating atoms [2,3]; rapid all–
optical switching [4]; and anomalous superradiant emis-
sion, as well as low–threshold lasing near the edge of a
PBG [5,6]. Microfabrication of PCs with complete PBGs
at optical wavelengths has proven to be a diﬃcult task,
both because the lattice periodicity should be compara-
ble to the wavelength of the light under consideration,
and because a high dielectric contrast between the ele-
ments of the lattice is required. Fortunately, recent ad-
vances in microlithography [7]and in semiconductor in-

ﬁltration in colloidal crystals [8] have produced materi-
als with signiﬁcant pseudo–gaps in their photonic band
structure [9]. The development of materials with com-
plete PBGs in the optical regime appears imminent.

High–quality PBG materials at microwave frequencies
have been available for some time [10]. Sizeable band–
gaps with center frequencies ranging from a few GHz up
to 2 THz have been reported; these crystals have thus
proven the soundness of the concept of the PBG. Mi-
crowave PBG materials may be relatively easily manu-
factured using micro-machining techniques, and are cur-
rently of interest for applications such as the shielding of
human tissue from microwave radiation, and for improv-
ing the radiation characteristics of microwave antennæ.
Although PBG materials at microwave frequencies have
been extensively studied, the behavior of radiating dipo-
lar antennæ embedded in microwave PCs has not re-
ceived the same degree of attention. This is despite the
fact that such antennæ would share many properties in
common with atomic emission in a PC. In the microwave
domain, a dipole antenna could take the form of an elec-
trically excited metallic pin with a high Q (quality) fac-
tor.

The radiative dynamics of the above system can be de-
scribed by a charged, one–dimensional simple harmonic
oscillator (SHO). Such an electric dipole oscillator can
also provide an excellent description of the radiation of
single or multiple two–level atoms in the optical domain.
This description is valid provided that the total excita-
tion energy of the atoms is well below an energy where
saturation (nonlinear) eﬀects become important. More-
over, the radiation reservoir can itself be modeled as a
bath of many independent SHOs: Radiative damping
arises from a linear coupling between the system SHO
and the large number of reservoir oscillator modes. The
similarities between the microwave and optical systems,
coupled with the mature state of microwave technology,
suggests that many of the predicted eﬀects for atomic

1

dipoles in the optical domain could be realized and stud-
ied ﬁrst in the microwave domain.

Analytical techniques exist for treating certain forms
of coupling between the dipole and reservoir for cer-
tain modal distributions of the reservoir. However,
PCs present coupling distributions and spectral prop-
erties which defy analytical methods. This is due to
the presence of a restricted and rapidly–varying reservoir
mode distribution, which renders invalid the usual Born–
Markov type approximation schemes for the system–
reservoir interaction. To obtain accurate results, we solve
the system numerically for a large, but ﬁnite, number
of oscillators in the reservoir by discretizing the modes
of the reservoir following the approach of Ullersma [11].
In dealing with our system, there are crucial issues con-
cerning obtaining the correct coupling strength between
the oscillator and the reservoir modes, as well as in em-
ploying the proper renormalization and mode sampling
in numerical simulations. When these criteria are satis-
ﬁed, the SHO method comprises a powerful approach to
treating radiative dynamics.

Here, we develop a rigorous quantitative treatment of
the radiative dynamics of an electric dipole oscillator cou-
pled to the electromagnetic reservoir within a model PC.
In the process, we provide a sound theoretical basis for
this and other approaches [12] to non-Markovian radia-
tive dynamics which involve the discretization of a model
electromagnetic reservoir. Additionally, we show how our
method can be applied to realistic PC’s with complicated
dispersion relations and EM mode structures. The pa-
per is organized as follows. In Section II, we develop a
classical ﬁeld theory for electromagnetic ﬁeld modes in
PCs, and we derive the coupling constants for the cou-
pling between a radiating dipole and these Bloch modes.
This leads to the Hamiltonian of the coupled system and
the associated equations of motion. Renormalization is-
sues arising from the non–relativistic nature of our the-
ory are discussed in Section III, whereas Section IV de-
scribes the discretization of the reservoir and the numer-
ical solution of the equations of motion. In Section V,
these techniques are applied to a highly computationally
challenging model, that of a three–dimensional, isotropic
dispersion relation with a complete PBG. The demon-
stration of fractional localization and related phenomena
validates the SHO approach to modeling radiative dy-
namics in PCs. In Section VI we summarize the results
and emphasize the possibilities for testing these predic-
tions experimentally in the microwave domain. The two
appendices are concerned with the details of the ﬁeld the-
ory for the PC and with the details of the model of the
one–sided, isotropic PBG, respectively.

II. CLASSICAL FIELD THEORY

In this section, we derive the equations governing the
dynamics of a radiating dipole oscillator located inside a

PC. Typically the equation of motion for a damped os-
cillator, with time-dependent coordinate q(t), is written
as the second–order diﬀerential equation

¨q(t) + γ ˙q(t) + ω2

0q(t) = F (t).

(1)

Here, we have introduced a damping constant γ, the
natural frequency ω0 and the driving ﬁeld F (t) for the
amplitude q of the linear oscillator. For instance, for a
freely oscillating RLC circuit with ohmic resistance R,
capacitance C and inductance L, we have γ = R/L,
ω2
0 = 1/LC, F (t) = 0, and q(t) is the electric charge. Eq.
(1) is, however, not the most general way of incorporat-
ing damping into the equations of motion for a harmonic
oscillator. This description can break down if, for exam-
ple, there is a suppression of modes in the reservoir to
which the dipole oscillator can couple. Such a suppres-
sion of modes is a feature of the EM reservoir present
in a PC. A more general description of damping forces
acting on the harmonic oscillator therefore requires a pre-
cise knowledge of the mode structure of its environment,
and the corresponding coupling of the system oscillator
to these modes. In the case of a radiating dipole located
in a PC, it is then appropriate to model its emission
dynamics with a SHO coupled to a reservoir of SHOs.
The essential diﬀerence between the vacuum and a PC
is then contained in the spectral distribution, or density
of states (DOS), of the reservoir oscillators, and in the
coupling constants between the reservoir modes and the
system oscillator.

The characterization of the reservoir is carried out in
detail in Appendix A; here we only summarize the salient
results. Given a radiating dipole with a natural frequency
ω0, we obtain the classical Hamiltonian

H = Hdip + Hres + Hct + Hint

.

(2)

The ﬁrst term on the right–hand side of the Hamiltonian
is the energy of the dipole oscillator itself,

Hdip = ξ ω0 |α|2.

(3)

The natural frequency of the isolated oscillator is ω0,
and ξ is a constant with the dimension of energy × time.
This permits us to write the energy of a SHO in units
of its natural frequency ω, i.e., E(ω) = ξω. The system
oscillator’s complex amplitude is given by the dimension-
less, time–dependent quantity α, deﬁned with respect to
the coordinate q(t) of Eq. (1) as

α(t) ≡s Lω0

2ξ

q(t) + ır 1

2ξLω0

(L ˙q(t)) .

(4)

The next term in the Hamiltonian (2) corresponds to
the free evolution of the radiation reservoir, which is
modeled as a bath of independent SHOs,

Hres =Xµ

ξ ωµ |βµ|2.

(5)

2

The natural electromagnetic modes of the PC are Bloch
modes (see Appendix A), labeled with the index µ ≡
(n~k), where n stands for the band index and ~k is a re-
ciprocal lattice vector that lies in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone
(BZ). Their dispersion relation, ωµ, is diﬀerent from the
vacuum case, and may have complete gaps and/or the
corresponding density of states may exhibit apprecia-
ble pseudogap structure, the manifestation of multiple
(Bragg) scattering eﬀects in periodic media.

As we are working within the framework of a non-
relativistic ﬁeld theory, we have introduced a mass renor-
malization counter term Hct = −ξ∆|α|2 that cancels un-
physical UV-divergent terms [13,14]. The quantity ∆ is
speciﬁed in Section III.

The interaction between the oscillator and the reservoir
is given by a linear coupling term. As the oscillator fre-
quency is quite large, and the eﬀective linewidth of the
oscillation is relatively small, it is possible to simplify
the interaction by applying the rotating–wave approxi-
mation. In this approximation, couplings in the Hamil-
tonian of the form α∗β∗
µ and its complex conjugate are
neglected, as these terms oscillate very rapidly compared
to the terms of the type α∗βµ and its conjugate. Hence,
the interaction Hamiltonian can be expressed as

Hint = −ıξXµ (cid:0) α∗ g∗

µ βµ − α gµ β∗

µ(cid:1) .

(6)

In the case of a point dipole, i.e., when its spatial ex-
tent a is much smaller than the wavelength corresponding
to its natural frequency, λ0 = 2πω0/c, the coupling con-
stants gµ can be derived from (i) the magnitude of the
dipole moment, d(t) = aq(t), located at ~r0, and (ii) the
dipole orientation, ˆd, relative to that of the Bloch modes,
~Eµ(~r0):

gµ ≡ gµ(~r0) = acr π

Lω0ωµ (cid:16) ˆd · ~E ∗

µ(~r0)(cid:17) .

(7)

This dependence of the coupling constant on the dipole’s
precise location within the PC is the second essential
diﬀerence from the free–space case. As shown in Refs.
[15,16], this position dependence may be quite strong,
thus making its incorporation a sine qua non for any
quantitative theory of of radiating antennæ or ﬂuores-
cence phenomena in realistic PCs.

The emission dynamics can be evaluated from the Pois-
son brackets of the oscillator amplitudes and their initial
values, α(0) = 1 and βµ(0) = 0 (∀µ). Our choice of α(0)
and βµ(0) corresponds to the initial condition of an ex-
cited dipole antenna and a completely de–excited bath.
The only non–zero Poisson brackets are

{α, α∗} =(cid:8)βµ, β∗

µ(cid:9) =

ı
ξ

.

(8)

Eqs. (2), (7) and (8), together with the initial values
for the oscillator amplitudes, completely determine the
emission dynamics of a radiating dipole embedded in a

PC. In the following sections, we solve the correspond-
ing equations of motion. This task is complicated by
the nature of the reservoir’s excitation spectrum: as dis-
cussed, the non-smooth density of states prohibits the use
of a Markovian approximation and its appealing simpli-
fying features [2,3,6].
Instead, we have to revert to a
solution of the full non–Markovian problem. This is ac-
complished by ﬁrstly rearranging the reservoir modes in
a manner more suitable to both analytical as well as nu-
merical solutions, and subsequently solving the equations
of motion. In what follows, we bridge the gap between
previous studies of simpliﬁed model dispersion relations
[2,3,6] and band structure computations [15,17].

Although we will formally develop our theory for an
LC circuit in a microwave PC, we emphasize that the
formalism applies equally well to a semiclassical Lorentz
oscillator model of an excited two-level atom, i.e., an
electron with charge e and mass m which is bound to
a stationary nucleus, for which the energy of excitation
is well below that required for saturation eﬀects to be-
come relevant. The oscillator coordinate q(t) may then
be identiﬁed with the deviation of the electron’s position
from its equilibrium value, γ is the inverse life time of
the excited state, and ω0 denotes the frequency for tran-
sitions between excited and ground state of the two-level
atom. This corresponds to making the substitutions:

L → m,

(L ˙q) → p, ξ → ¯h,

(9)

where h = 2π¯h is Planck’s constant.

III. PROJECTED LOCAL DENSITY OF STATES,
MASS RENORMALIZATION AND LAMB SHIFT

From the Hamiltonian (2) we derive the equations of

motion for the amplitudes

˙α(t) = −ı (ω0 − ∆) α(t) − ı ξXµ
˙βµ(t) = −ı ωµ βµ(t) + gµ α(t),

g∗
µ βµ(t)

(10)

(11)

for which we seek a solution with initial conditions α(0) =
1 and βµ(0) = 0 (∀µ). Our formalism however requires
that we ﬁrst determine the mass renormalization counter
term ∆. This is most conveniently done in a rotating
frame with slowly varying amplitudes a(t) and b(t), de-
ﬁned as α(t) = a(t)e−ıω0t and β(t) = b(t)e−ıωµt respec-
tively:

µ eı(ω0−ωµ)t bµ(t) + ı∆a(t)
g∗

˙a(t) = −ı ξXµ

˙b(t) = gµ e−ı(ωo−ωµ)t a(t).

(12)

(13)

Conversely, Eqs. (12) and (13) comprise a stiﬀ set of dif-
ferential equations making their solution a diﬃcult task.
Numerical solution of the problem is more easily per-
formed in the non-rotating frame, to which we return in
Sect. IV.

3

Eq. (13) may be formally integrated,

bµ(t) = gµZ t

0

dt′ e−ı(ω0−ωµ)t′

a(t′),

(14)

and inserted into Eq. (12) to yield

˙a(t) = −Z ∞

0

dt′ G(t − t′) a(t′) + ı∆a(t),

(15)

where the Green function G(τ ) contains all the informa-
tion about the reservoir and is the subject of our studies
for the remainder of this section. It is deﬁned as

G(τ ) ≡ Θ(τ )Xµ

|gµ|2 eı(ω0−ωµ)τ

.

(16)

Here, Θ(τ ) denotes the Heaviside step function, which
ensures the causality of G(τ ). We now proceed to evalu-
ate G(τ ) for the form of the coupling constants gµ given
in Eq. (7). To this end, we introduce the projected local
DOS (PLDOS) N (~r0, ˆd, ω) through

N (~r0, ˆd, ω) =Xn ZBZ

d3k
(2π)3 δ(ω − ωn~k)| ˆd · ~En~k(~r0)|2,

(17)

where we have replaced the symbolic sum over µ by its
proper representation as a sum over bands plus a wave
vector integral over the BZ. With these changes, we may
rewrite G(τ ) compactly as

G(τ ) = β Θ(τ )Z ∞

0

dω

N (~r0, ˆd, ω)

ω

eı(ω0−ω)τ .

(18)

Here, we have abbreviated β = (πa2c2)/(Lω0). Eq. (18)
makes more explicit what we have argued before: The
spontaneous emission dynamics of active media in Pho-
tonic Crystals are completely determined by the PLDOS,
N (~r0, ˆd, ω). As the PLDOS may be drastically diﬀerent
from location to location within the Wigner–Seitz cell of
the PC [15,16], it is imperative to have detailed knowl-
edge about where in the PC the dipole is situated in order
to understand and predict the outcome of corresponding
experiments.

One additional point deserves special attention: the

total DOS, N (ω), is related to the local DOS via

N (ω) =

6=

1

V ZV
V ZV

1

d3r Z dΩ ˆd ǫp(~r) N (~r, ˆd, ω)
d3rZ dΩ ˆd N (~r, ˆd, ω),

where V is the volume of the Wigner–Seitz cell, and

R dΩ ˆd is the average over all possible orientations of the

dipole. Strictly speaking, it is not possible to base con-
clusions about the radiation dynamics on the total DOS.
This is a direct consequence of the fact that the natural

4

modes of PCs are Bloch waves rather than plane waves as
in free space. Depending on the band index, these Bloch
modes prefer to “reside” predominantly in either low or
high dielectric index regions (so-called air and dielectric
bands respectively). Only in the case of very low index
contrast (“nearly free photons”) may the total DOS be
viewed as a reliable guide to interpreting radiative dy-
namics within a PC. The total DOS is, nevertheless, an
adequate rule-of-thumb estimator.

From Eq. (17) we can now obtain the Fourier transform
of the Green function, G(Ω − ω0), centered around the
atom’s bare transition frequency ω0:
G(Ω − ω0) =Z ∞

where ℘ stands for the principal value.

Ω − ω(cid:19) ,
For large ω, we have N (~r0, ˆd, ω) ∝ ω2. The imaginary
part of G(Ω− ω0) apparently contains a linear divergence
in the UV. This divergence is to be expected for a non-
relativistic theory, analogous to the problem of sponta-
neous emission in vacuum [13], and is removed from the
theory by using the mass counter renormalization term
∆, as ﬁrst pointed out by Bethe [14]. Consequently, we
decompose the imaginary part of G(Ω − ω0) into

ℑ (G(Ω − ω0)) ≃ −(∆ + δvac + δa),

(19)

where we have used the notation:
N (~r0, ˆd, ω)

∆ = βZ ∞
δvac = −

dω ℘(cid:18) 1
N (~r0, ˆd, ω) − N (vac)(ω)
×

ω2

.

Here, we have performed a Wigner–Weisskopf-type ap-
proximation on the vacuum and anomalous Lamb shifts
[2], δvac and δa, respectively. This approximation is jus-
tiﬁed by the fact that, despite its highly non–Markovian
nature, a radiating dipole in a PC is still a weak coupling
problem, as can be seen, for instance, by estimating the
coupling constant

g ≃ d0ω0s 2π

V ξωn~k

(20)

in the Lorentz oscillator model. Here, V ≈ ¯a3 is the
volume of the Wigner–Seitz cell of the PC (¯a is the cor-
responding lattice constant) and d0 = ea0 is the oscil-
lator’s dipole moment for the elementary charge e and

Bohr atomic radius, a0. At optical frequencies (ω ≈ 1015
s−1), a silicon inverted opal has a PBG at the fre-
quency ¯aω/2πc ≈ 0.8, so that we obtain 10−7 ≤ g/ω0 ≤
10−6 ≪ 1, thus justifying our Wigner–Weisskopf approx-
imation. As a consequence, we must treat the real part
of G(Ω − ω0) exactly, but are still allowed to tackle the
imaginary part of G(Ω − ω0) using standard perturba-
tion methods of QED. In addition, we have introduced
the vacuum or free–space DOS N (vac)(ω) = ω2/(π2c3),
and a cutoﬀ frequency Ωc ≫ ω0, which is chosen large
enough that the results of the following analysis remain
independent of the precise value of Ωc. In a Lorentz os-
cillator model, for instance, Ωc can be identiﬁed with the
Compton frequency Ωc ≃ mc2/¯h, as ω > ωc probes the
relativistic aspects of the oscillating charge, which are
beyond the scope of the model.

With the foregoing analysis, we have determined the
mass renormalization counter term ∆. In addition, we
have derived an explicit expression for the anomalous
Lamb shift δa [2] which originates in the “reshuﬄing”
of the reservoir’s spectral weight by the PC.

IV. DISCRETIZATION OF THE RESERVOIR

To solve the equation of motion for the amplitude of
the system oscillator, let us rewrite Eq. (15) in a more
explicit form:

˙a(t) = −Z ∞

0

dω N (~r0, ˆd, ω) g2(ω)Z t

0

+ı∆ a(t),

dt′ eı(ω0−ω)(t−t′)a(t′)

(21)

where g2(ω) = β/ω, and the mass renormalization
counter term ∆ is given by

∆ = βZ ∞

0

dω

N (~r0, ˆd, ω)

ω2

.

(22)

We remind the reader that a(0) = 1.

We are now in a position to comment on the origin of
the linear damping term γ ˙q(t) that appears in Eq. (1):
If we consider the long time limit, i. e., t ≫ 1/ω0, and
assume that the PLDOS N (~r0, ˆd, ω) is a smooth function
for frequencies around ω0, we can approximate the fre-

quency integral in Eq. (21) byh2πβN (~r0, ˆd, ω0)/ω0i δ(t−

t′), which leads to

˙a(t) = −γa(t),

where the decay constant is deﬁned as

γ = 2πβN (~r0, ˆd, ω0)/ω0.

(23)

(24)

This approximation is is valid only for long times relative
to 1/ω0, and for a suﬃciently smooth density of states.
However, in the case of a PC, the PLDOS may have

5

sharp discontinuities and gaps, thus requiring that the
full equations of motion instead.

To solve the integro-diﬀerential equation (21) in a PC,
we appeal to the literal meaning of the PLDOS as a den-
sity of states: N (~r0, ˆd, ω) may be interpreted as an un-
normalized probability density of ﬁnding a reservoir oscil-
lator with frequency ω at position ~r0 and orientation ˆd.
Consequently, we transform Eq. (21) back to a system
of coupled diﬀerential equations by employing a Monte
Carlo integration scheme for an arbitrary function f (ω)
according to

Z ∞

0

(25)

where the normalization constant

N0 =Z Ωc

0

dω N (~r0, ˆd, ω)

(26)

depends on the cutoﬀ frequency, Ωc. There are M ≫ 1
bath oscillators, contained within a set of frequencies
{ωi, 1 ≤ i ≤ M}, the frequencies of which are obtained
by randomly sampling the interval [0, Ωc] according to
the probability density p(~r0, ˆd, ω) = N (~r0, ˆd, ω)/N0.
Note that the ωi may be degenerate, as prescribed by
p(~r0, ˆd, ω).

Applying this Monte Carlo scheme to Eq. (21) and
transforming back to a non-rotating frame in order to
avoid having to solve a numerically stiﬀ problem, we ob-
tain

where gi = g(ωi), 1 ≤ i ≤ M , and the mass renormaliza-
tion counter term is evaluated up to the cutoﬀ frequency
Ωc, i.e., ∆ =R Ωc

When comparing Eqs. (27) and (28) to our initial equa-
tions of motion, Eqs. (10) and (11), we observe that the
considerations in the previous section have allowed us
to rearrange the three-dimensional wave vector sum over
the modes µ ≡ (n~k) into a simple one-dimensional sum
over a set of frequencies {ωi} with a probability distri-
bution p(~r0, ˆd, ω) that is easily determined through stan-
dard photonic band structure computation [15]. In the
following section, we give the solutions of (27) and (28)
for a model system which has previously been treated by
other methods. In particular, we will demonstrate that
known results for the radiative dynamics can be recap-
tured and do not depend on the the value of the cutoﬀ fre-
quency Ωc and the number M of reservoir oscillators once
these quantities are large enough such that all the rele-
vant features of N (~r0, ˆd, ω), are adequately represented.

V. NUMERICAL RESULTS FOR A MODEL

SYSTEM

Fig 1. This demonstrates that, despite the presence of
the singularities in the DOS, our approach still provides
accurate and convergent results.

In order to establish the validity of our approach, we
now solve Eqs. (27) and (28) for a generic model of a
PBG, the three-dimensional isotropic, one-sided PBG [3].
In Appendix B, we outline the construction of the model’s
dispersion relation and how to obtain the corresponding
model DOS, Nm(ω). We note that we do not appeal to
an eﬀective mass approximation in the dispersion relation
[6], as is done in most treatments of band–edge dynamics.
This allows us to recover the correct form of the large
frequency behavior of the photon density of states.

In Fig. 1, we show the behavior of Nm(ω) as a func-
tion of frequency for values of the relevant parameters,
the gap size parameter η = 0.8 and the normalized cen-
ter frequency ωca/2πc = 0.5 (see Appendix B). The
DOS exhibits a square-root singularity at the band edge
ωua/2πc = 0.6, as well as a UV divergence, Nm(ω) ∝ ω2,
as ω → ∞; these are the characteristic features of this
model. Due to the simultaneous presence of both diver-
gences, this model clearly represents a severe numerical
test of our approach. In order to test the method, we
thus replace the PLDOS entering Eqs. (27) and (28) by
Nm(ω).

In Fig. 2, we present the results of our numerical so-
lution for the radiation dynamics of a dipole oscillator
with frequency ω0 that is coupled to the modes of a PC,
as described by Eqs. (27) and (28), for various values
of the bare oscillator frequency, ω0a/2πc, relative to the
bandedge at ωua/2πc = 0.6. The coupling strength has
been chosen such that g(ω0) = 10−4, corresponding to
β = 10−8 × ω3
0.
Clearly visible are normal mode oscillations, also re-
ferred to as vacuum Rabi oscillations, and the fractional
localization of the oscillator’s energy at long times near
the photonic band–edge [3]. As expected, for frequen-
cies deep in the photonic band–gap (ω0a/2πc = 0.58),
where the system oscillator is eﬀectively decoupled from
the bath oscillators, we ﬁnd no noticeable decay of the
oscillator amplitude. Deep in the photonic conduction
band (ω0a/2πc = 0.62), the system oscillator is coupled
to a bath with a smooth and slowly–varying mode den-
sity, as in free space. We therefore observe exponential
decay of the oscillator amplitude, though with a time
scale that diﬀers signiﬁcantly from that in free space.
Due to the large value of the DOS close to the pho-
tonic band edge, the initial decay is faster for bare os-
cillator frequencies close to this edge than for frequencies
deep inside the allowed photonic band. These results
were obtained for a smooth exponential cutoﬀ for the
DOS around Ωca/2πc = 3.0 and M = 2.5 × 105 oscil-
lators representing the modes of the PC. We also per-
formed numerical simulations between all combinations
of Ωc and M with values Ωca/2πc = 3.0, 6.0, 9.0 and
M = 2.5 × 105, 5 × 105, 106 and found that the numeri-
cal values diﬀer by at most 0.2% of the values shown in

VI. DISCUSSION

In summary, we have developed a realistic ﬁeld theory
for an oscillating electric dipole located in a PC. The
theory is based on the natural modes of the PC, the
Bloch waves, and allows the direct incorporation of real-
istic band structure calculations in order to obtain quan-
titative results for the radiation dynamics of the dipole
antenna. We have shown how the theory must be renor-
malized in order to account for unphysical divergences
and have identiﬁed the classical analogue of the Lamb
shift of the dipole’s natural radiation frequency. Finally,
we have developed a reliable numerical scheme based on
a probability interpretation of the PLDOS that solves the
equations of motion for the dipole oscillator coupled to
the electromagnetic mode reservoir of the PC.

The viability of this approach was demonstrated for
an isotropic model DOS for which we have derived well-
known results for radiating atomic systems [3] in the con-
text of a radiating classical dipole. The model considered
contains two divergences, one square-root-divergence at
the photonic band edge and a quadratic UV-divergence,
and therefore clearly comprises the most serious test
of our approach. More realistic models of a three di-
mensional photonic band-edge take into account the
anisotropy of the BZ, and therefore do not suﬀer from
a band–edge singularity [6]. As a result, our formalism is
clearly more than capable of treating more realistic de-
scriptions of the electromagnetic reservoir within a PC.
Though we have developed our theory for an LC cir-
cuit in a microwave PC, we have pointed out in Section
II that the formalism applies equally well to a semiclassi-
cal Lorentz oscillator model of an excited two-level atom.
Therefore, our approach is applicable to both microwave
antennæ and to optical atomic transitions. However,
technological constraints suggest that microwave experi-
ments will likely be easier to perform than optical exper-
iments involving single atoms. As discussed, an appro-
priate microwave antenna could, for example, take the
form of a high-Q metallic pin placed in or near a PC.
The pin can then be excited by a focused ultrashort laser
pulse that generates free carriers at one end; these carri-
ers then undergo several oscillations across the pin before
re–establishing charge equilibrium. The resulting signal
could be easily detected and compared with the emis-
sion from such an antenna positioned in free space, or
within a homogeneous sample of the dielectric material
that makes up the backbone of the PC under considera-
tion.

In its own right, such a microwave system could have
considerable applications in radio science and microwave
technology. For example, the PBG can be used as a fre-

6

quency ﬁlter, and can be used to ﬁne tune the bandwidth
of a dipole emitter with a resonant frequency near the
edge of the gap. It may also be possible to actively modify
the photonic band structure, eﬀectively changing the ra-
diation pattern of a dipole emitter. A feasible scheme for
active band structure modiﬁcation has recently been pro-
posed in the context of optical PCs [18], in which the PC
is inﬁltrated with a liquid crystalline material whose ne-
matic director is aligned using applied electric ﬁelds. By
rotating the director, it was found that the band struc-
ture could be signiﬁcantly modiﬁed, and that PBGs may
be opened and closed altogether. Similar methods may
be applied to the case of microwave PCs.

Although we have concentrated speciﬁcally on the lin-
ear model, the method of coupled oscillators can be ex-
tended to treat a nonlinear antennæ , or a collection
of two–level atoms in a regime where saturation eﬀects
arise. As we have shown here, this method of coupled
classical oscillators reproduces eﬀects normally associ-
ated with quantum optical calculations. We expect that
a nonlinear oscillator model will reproduce some of the
eﬀects studied for a single two–level atom coupled to the
modes of a PC without the need for quantizing the ﬁeld.
However, a classical treatment would need to be aban-
doned if multiphoton excitations are non–negligible [12].
Given that multiphoton eﬀects are diﬃcult to observe in
the microwave domain [19] and even more challenging in
the optical domain [20], it is reasonable to expect that a
classical model of radiative dynamics in a PC should be
suﬃcient for foreseeable experiments.

APPENDIX A: CLASSICAL FIELD THEORY

FOR PHOTONIC CRYSTALS

In this Appendix, we present a self-contained formula-
tion of a classical ﬁeld theory for the Bloch modes of a
PC, and we develop the Hamiltonian describing the cou-
pling of a radiating dipole couples to these modes. As
a ﬁrst step, we review the computation of dispersion re-
lations, and of electric and magnetic ﬁeld modes from

band structure calculations [15]. We then demonstrate
how the results of such band structure calculations can
be used to construct the corresponding vector potentials
and free ﬁeld Hamiltonian. Finally, we derive the full
minimal coupling Hamiltonian for a classical radiating
dipole embedded in a PC. This may be compared to the
formulation of a general, quantized ﬁeld theory for EM
modes in nonuniform dielectric media in terms of a nor-
mal mode expansion in the context of quantum optics
[21].

1. Review of band structure calculations

We develop our theory in terms of the magnetic ﬁeld ~H
rather than in terms of the electric or displacement ﬁelds
because (i) ∇ · ~H = 0 and, (ii) the transverse and longi-
tudinal components of the magnetic ﬁeld are continuous
across the dielectric boundaries. This leads to more rapid
convergence of the relevant Fourier series expansions.

In a three-dimensional PC, we can write the eigenvalue

equation for the magnetic ﬁeld ~H as

∇ ×(cid:16)ηp(~r)∇ × ~H(cid:17) +

ω2
c2

~H = ~0

(A1)

with ηp(~r) the inverse of the periodic dielectric permit-
tivity,

ǫp(~r) = ǫb + (ǫa − ǫb) X~n∈Z 3

S(~r − ~n · A).

(A2)

The medium is assumed to consist of a background ma-
terial with bulk permittivity ǫb and a set of scatterers,
with bulk permittivity ǫa. The shape of the scatterers is
described by the function S, i. e.,, S(~r) = 1 if ~r lies inside
the scatterer and zero elsewhere, distributed periodically
at positions

n ~Ro =( 3
Xi=1

ni~ai|ni ∈ Z) .

(A3)

The notation of Eq. (A2) is obtained by deﬁning the
matrix A = (~a1 ~a2 ~a3) and Z 3 = Z ⊗ Z ⊗ Z. The di-
electric permittivity is spatially periodic modula ~n · A.
The assumption of a scalar permittivity is reasonable
for bulk materials which are not birefringent but in no
way restricts the considerations below. Chromatic dis-
persion eﬀects are considered to be negligible, thus al-
lowing the time-dependence of the permittivity to be ig-
nored. Let us deﬁne the dual matrix B = 2π(A−1)T .
For B = (~b1~b2~b3), this deﬁnition leads to the orthogo-
nality relation

~ai · ~bj = 2π δij.

(A4)

Whereas the points ~n·A are the real space lattice vectors,
the points ~m · B, for ~m ∈ Z 3 are the reciprocal lattice

7

vectors. The inverse permittivity can be expanded in the
dual basis as

ηp(~r) = X~m∈Z 3

η ~meı ~m·B·~r.

(A5)

The diﬀerential equation (A1) has periodic coeﬃcients.
By the Bloch-Floquet theorem we can expand the mag-
netic ﬁeld as

~H~k = eı~k·~r ~u~k(~r)

(A6)

where ~u~k is spatially periodic modulo A; that is,

~u~k(~r) = ~u~k(~r + ~n · A).

(A7)
The set {~k} labeling the solutions can be restricted to lie
within in the irreducible part of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone
(BZ), since any value of ~k can then be obtained through
a combination of group transformations with respect to
an operation from the point group of the crystal and
translations with respect to a reciprocal lattice vector.
We can therefore express each wavevector ~k as

~k ≡ ~kT , ~m ≡ ~k∗ · T + ~m · B ,

(A8)

where ~k∗ is an element of the irreducible part of the 1.
BZ and T an element of the crystal’s point group.

Applying the Bloch-Floquet theorem, Eq. (A6), the

magnetic ﬁeld can be expanded as

Here λ is the index of polarization and the vectors

~H~k = eı~k·~rX~m

form an orthonormal right-handed triad. This expansion
inserted into Eq (A1) yields an inﬁnite eigenvalue prob-
lem which is then solved numerically by a suitable trun-
cation. Typically the cardinality of the set { ~m} is on the
order of 103 [15]. For any given ~k∗ we obtain a discrete
set of eigenfrequencies ωn~k and corresponding eigenfunc-
tions Hn~k which we label by the band index n ∈ N . It
is important to note that the expression for the electric
ﬁeld can be recovered from the magnetic ﬁeld via

2. Free–ﬁeld Hamiltonian

Based on the above considerations, we are now in a
position to derive the general expressions for the scalar
and vector potential, φ(~r, t) and ~A(~r, t) respectively, for
the classical Hamiltonian of the free radiation ﬁeld. We
ﬁnd that the expressions become particularly transparent
in the Dzyaloshinsky gauge, i.e., when φ(~r, t) ≡ 0. Then,

1

∂ ~A(~r, t)

~E(~r, t) = −
,
~H(~r, t) = ∇ × ~A(~r, t) ,

∂ t

(A14)

(A15)

and the gauge condition ∇ ·(cid:16)ǫp(~r) ~A(~r, t)(cid:17) = 0, reveals

that in a PC the natural modes of the radiation ﬁeld are
no longer transverse. This is of importance when quan-
tizing the ﬁeld theory [21,22]. Given Eqs. (A1), (A11),
(A14) and (A15), it is now straightforward to derive the
following expansion of the vector potential ~A(~r, t)

~A(~r, t) =Xn ZBZ

(A16)

where the time evolution of the free ﬁeld is described by
βn~k(t) = βn~k(0)e−ıωn~kt. The ﬁeld modes ~An~k(~r) obey

(A9)

∇ × ∇ × ~An~k(~r) =

ω2
n~k
c2 ǫp(~r) ~An~k(~r) ,

(A17)

which is the same equation as that for the electric ﬁeld
modes ~En~k(~r) of Eq. (A11). We now choose the normal-
ization of ~An~k such that
Z d3r ǫp(~r) ~An~k(~r) · ~Am~k′ (~r) = δnm δ(~k − ~k′) ,
Z d3r (cid:16)∇ × ~An~k(~r)(cid:17) ·(cid:16)∇ × ~Am~k′ (~r)(cid:17) =

(A11)

This also ﬁxes the normalization in Eqs. (A12) and (A13).
As a consequence, the total electric and magnetic ﬁeld are
now given by

In addition, the Bloch waves obey the following orthog-
onality relations:

n~k

Z d3r ~H ∗
Z d3r ǫp(~r) ~E ∗

n~k

(~r) · ~Em~k′ (~r) ∝ δnm δ(~k − ~k′) ,

(A12)

(A13)

where the integration is over all space in both cases. We
are free to choose the constants of proportionality in the
above relations, and do so in the next subsection.

3. Radiating dipole embedded in a Photonic Crystal

We consider the insertion of a point dipole into a PBG
structure at a prescribed location ~r0. The free dipole
oscillator is described by the Hamiltonian Hdip

Hdip =

L ˙q2
2L

+

L ω2

0 q2 = ξω0 |α|2,

(A23)

where the dipole’s natural frequency is ω0 = 1/LC and
the complex oscillator amplitude α is given in terms of

the charge q and “current” L ˙q as α(t) = q(t)pLω0/2w +
ı(L ˙q(t))/√2ξLω0, with Poisson brackets {α, α∗} = ı/ξ.
The point dipole couples to the electric ﬁeld via its dipole
moment d(t) = aq(t) with orientation ˆd, which yields the
interaction energy

Hint = −aq(t)(cid:16) ˆd · ~E(~r0, t)(cid:17) .

(A24)

In the rotating wave approximation to the interaction
term, the ﬁnal minimal coupling Hamiltonian for a radi-
ating dipole in a PC is

H = Hdip + Hres + Hct + Hint.

(A25)

Collecting all the above results we obtain
ξωµ |βµ|2 + Hct

µ(cid:1) .

H = ξω0 |α|2 +Xµ
−ıξXµ (cid:0) α∗ g∗

(A26)

Here, we have introduced the symbolic index µ ≡ (n~k)
and the coupling constants gµ

gµ ≡ gµ(~r0) = acr π

Lω0ωµ (cid:16) ˆd · ~E ∗

µ(~r0)(cid:17) .

(A27)

In addition, in Eq. (A25) we have introduced a mass
renormalization counter term, Hct = −ξ∆|α|2 in or-
der to cancel unphysical UV-divergent terms of our non-
relativistic theory, as discussed in the main text. For
completeness, we list here only the nonzero Poisson
brackets and initial values for an initially excited radi-
ating dipole coupled to the Bloch waves of a PC. This,
together with the Hamilton function H in Eq. (A25) com-
pletely deﬁnes our problem:

µ(cid:9) =

APPENDIX B: MODEL DISPERSION RELATION

AND DENSITY OF STATES

A particularly stringent test of our approach’s ability
to describe the dynamics of a radiating dipole in a PC
comes from its application to a dipole coupled to a 3D
isotropic photon dispersion model for the electromagnetic
reservoir. In this model, the coherent scattering condi-
tion that characterizes the photonic band edge is assumed
to occur at the same frequency for all directions of propa-
gation. Clearly this is not the case in a real crystal, whose
Brillouin zone cannot have full rotational symmetry. As
a result, the isotropic model overestimates the electro-
magnetic modes available at a band–edge, so that, for
example, near the upper photonic band edge at frequency
ωu, the corresponding DOS exhibits a divergence of the

form N (ω) ∝ 1/√ω − ωu. Conversely, for large frequen-
cies (ω ≫ ωu) the DOS will exhibit a UV-divergence, i.e.,
N (ω) ∝ ω2, as is the case in free space. More realistic
LDOS’ coming from full photonic band structure compu-
tations do not suﬀer from the pathological band edge di-
vergence of the isotropic model. However, by solving the
model of a 3D isotropic photonic band gap, we make con-
tact with previous results based on the isotropic model
in the eﬀective mass approximation [3].

Consider a 1D photonic dispersion relation in the ex-
tended zone scheme. In order to describe a PBG at wave
number k0 with central frequency ωc = ck0 = (ωu +ωl)/2
and upper and lower band edge at ωu and ωl, respectively,
we use the following Ansatz

. (B1)

ω(k) =


ω+ + c+q(k − k0)2 + γ2
ω− + c−q(k − k0)2 + γ2

+ for k > 0

− for k < 0

Using the requirements ω(k = 0) = 0, ω(k = k0 − 0+) =
ωl, ω(k = k0 +0+) = ωu, ∂kω(k = 0) = ∂kω(k → ∞) = c,
and ∂kω(k = k0 − 0+) = ∂kω(k = k0 + 0+) = 0, the
unknown parameters in (B1) can easily be expressed in
terms of a single parameter η = ωl/ωc, 1/2 < η ≤ 1
that describes the size of the photonic bandgap, giving:
ω+ = ωc, c+ = c, γ+ = k0(1 − η), ω− = ωc(η2)/(2η − 1),
c− = cη/√2η − 1, and γ− = k0(1 − η)/√2η − 1.
From the dispersion relation (B1), the corresponding
DOS, i. e., N (ω) =R d3k δ(ω − ω(k)) is given by

[k0−√(ω−ω−)2/c2

−γ 2

For suﬃciently large gaps (η ≤ 0.9) and bare eigenfre-
quencies ω0 of the radiating dipole close to the upper
band edge, it is an excellent approximation to ignore
the lower branch of the photon dispersion relation, i. e.,

Figure 1: The DOS for the three-dimensional, isotropic
one-sided bandgap model of a PC. The parameters (see
appendix B) are η = 0.8 and ωca/2πc = 0.5.

Figure 2: The radiation dynamics resulting from the
three-dimensional,
isotropic one-sided bandgap model
DOS as shown in Fig. 1 for various values of the bare
dipole oscillator frequency ω0 relative to the upper pho-
tonic bandedge ωu. The photonic bandedge is siutated
at ωua/2πc = 0.6 and the bare dipole oscillator frequen-
cies are (a) ω0a/2πc = 0.58, (b) ω0a/2πc = 0.595, (c)
ω0a/2πc = 0.599, (d) ω0a/2πc = 0.6, (e) ω0a/2πc =
0.601, (f) ω0a/2πc = 0.605, and (g) ω0a/2πc = 0.62.
Clearly visible are normal–mode oscillations, or vacuum
Rabi oscillations, and the fractional localization of radia-
tion near the photonic bandedge. The coupling strength
has been chosen such that g(ω0) = 10−4. For frequen-
cies deep in the photonic bandgap (ω0a/2πc = 0.58) and
deep in the photonic conduction band (ω0a/2πc = 0.62)
we observe negligible and exponential decay, respectively.

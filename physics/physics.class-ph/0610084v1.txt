Abstract

We consider one-dimensional classical time-dependent Hamiltonian systems with quasi-periodic
orbits. It is well-known that such systems possess an adiabatic invariant which coincides with the
action variable of the Hamiltonian formalism. We present a new proof of the adiabatic invariance
of this quantity and illustrate our arguments by means of explicit calculations for the harmonic
oscillator.

The new proof makes essential use of the Hamiltonian formalism. The key step is the introduc-
tion of a slowly-varying quantity closely related to the action variable. This new quantity arises
naturally within the Hamiltonian framework as follows: a canonical transformation is ﬁrst per-
formed to convert the system to action-angle coordinates; then the new quantity is constructed as
an action integral (eﬀectively a new action variable) using the new coordinates. The integration
required for this construction provides, in a natural way, the averaging procedure introduced in
other proofs, though here it is an average in phase space rather than over time.

Introduction

At the Solvay Conference in 1911, Einstein answered a question raised by Lorentz with the statement ‘If
the length of a pendulum is changed inﬁnitely slowly, its energy remains equal to hν if it was originally
hν’.1 The expression ‘adiabatic invariant’ came to be used in this context, and this has stuck over the
years, even though the change of the system has to be slow, rather than adiabatic in the thermodynamic
sense2 and the quantity in question is not invariant — and indeed may not even change very slowly, as
will be discussed further.

Adiabatic invariance is readily understandable at a superﬁcial level: students studying classical
mechanics have no diﬃculty with the idea that, for a simple pendulum, the quantity E/ω changes
very slowly in some sense when the frequency ω is slowly varied. However, the details are often found
more elusive, and with good reason: the concept is fundamentally subtle and the proof of invariance
is genuinely diﬃcult. The treatment given in most texts relies on the theory of action-angle variables,
which already involves a signiﬁcant level of sophistication; and in addition some form of averaging is

1This was apparently ﬁrst noticed by Rayleigh in 1902 for the classical pendulum; however, Lorentz’s question related

to a pendulum oscillating in a particular quantum state.

2An adiabatic change in thermodynamics is one that happens with no gain or loss of heat.

usually required. Moreover, many texts are careless of details, omit to state exactly what is being
done and do not reveal the motivation for doing what is done. There is a danger too, always present
when canonical transformations are used, of losing track of the relation between the dependent and
independent variables.

We conﬁne our attention to the case of a one-dimensional system governed by a Hamiltonian

where λ is slowly varying in a sense that we will deﬁne precisely in section 5. The quantity I deﬁned

is an adiabatic invariant of this system. The integral is to be taken round the curve (assumed to be
closed) in phase space given by H(p, q, λ) = E at constant λ. It represents the area inside the curve.
It is important to realize that this integral is a purely geometrical construction; it takes no account of
the time evolution of the system.

It is always a good idea to have in mind the example of the time-varying simple harmonic oscillator

with Hamiltonian H(p, q, ω) given by

H(p, q, ω(t)) =

(p2 + ω2(t)q2).

For this system, we may easily calculate the integral in (2) to obtain I = E/ω, with the implication
that to a good approximation the energy will change proportionally to the frequency.

For many simple systems, it is not even necessary to calculate the integral. For example, in the case

H = (p2 + λq4)/2, we have

from which we see that I is a numerical multiple of (E3/λ)

Of course, I is not in general exactly invariant.3 It is necessary therefore to give a precise deﬁnition
of adiabatic invariance. Clearly, any quantity such as I (which is essentially an average over a cycle)
will vary slowly, since the system varies slowly. In order for I to be adiabatic, it must vary more slowly,
in some sense than λ varies and this means that a proof of adiabatic invariance must keep careful track
of any error terms.

In the next section, we illustrate some of the features of I by examining a particular adiabatic
variation of the harmonic oscillator. In the third section we discuss strategies for diﬀerentiating I in
order to determine its rate of change. In the fourth section we revisit the harmonic oscillator problem,
in this case we consider a general adiabatic variation and present a new proof of the adiabatic invariance
of I. In the ﬁfth section, we show how this proof can be applied to more general systems. Finally in
section 6 we summarize our discussion and present our conclusions.

2 The time dependence of I: harmonic oscillator case

In some cases, it is possible to investigate the time dependence of I by solving Hamilton’s equations
and evaluating the area integral (2) explicitly. It is instructive to look at the simplest case of the simple
3Interestingly, for the harmonic oscillator, there is an exact invariant (called the Ermakov-Lewis invariant — see [1]

for a useful discussion) which can be written in the form

This could be regarded as the approximation, by Taylor series, to a more general slowly-varying ω(t),
it would entail keeping track
but for present purposes that would sacriﬁce clarity to little purpose:
of an additional set of error terms and the calculations are messy enough in the special case. For
similar reasons we will restrict attention to ǫ > 0. The ﬁnal expressions would look better if we had set
ω2 = ω2
0(1+ǫt), but the necessary factors can easily be inserted at the end on dimensional considerations.

We will solve Hamilton’s equations explicitly for this system in terms of Airy functions, then calculate

the value of I(t) using standard asymptotic expansions for the Airy functions.

Hamilton’s equations are ˙q = p, ˙p =

(see [2] for details). Making use of the fact that the Wronskian of Ai(z) and Bi(z) is π−1, we can write

From this result, we can make two important observations:

The time rate of change of I(t) is not smaller than that of the Hamiltonian; both are ﬁrst order
in the small parameter ǫ;

I(t) does not grow at a rate proportional to ǫ; rather, it oscillates and the time-average does not
contain a term proportional to ǫ.

3 The time dependence of I: general case

In order to evaluate the integral (2), we can in principle solve the equation H(p, q, t) = E at any ﬁxed
time t, to obtain a solution of the form p = P (E, q, t). Of course, in practice the appropriate value
of E at time t can be obtained explicitly only by solving Hamilton’s equations for the system with
appropriate initial conditions, obtaining a trajectory in phase space of the from p = P (t), q = Q(t) and
setting E(t) = H(P (t), Q(t), t).

At this point, it is instructive to analyse a calculation that is used the basis of the proof of adiabatic

This seems to be a good result, but as it stands here it is wrong. The step that is incorrect depends on
how the integral is to be interpreted and three diﬀerent interpretations can be found. It should be said
that the proofs of adiabatic invariance normally include some sort of averaging which can obfuscate the
deﬁciencies of the above argument.

If the integral is interpreted as being taken round the closed curve H(p, q, t) = E (which is how
such integrals will be deﬁned in this paper), then equation (12) is wrong: the identity dE/dt = ∂H/∂t
follows from Hamilton’s equations and Hamilton’s equations for the trajectory of the system whose rate
of change of energy is dE/dt do not hold on the closed curve. Instead, dE/dt = 0 on this curve, which
leads to a rather unhelpful integral.

If instead the path of integration is along the trajectory of the system between points at which q = 0
(say), then the curve is not closed and attention would have to be paid to the variation of the endpoints
in equation (11); to put it another way, the diﬀerentiation cannot simply be taken under the integral
sign. As a complicating factor in this case, the integral we are diﬀerentiating is not equal to I, and
extra error terms need to be included to account for this discrepancy.

Finally, if the path of integration is the closed curve E = H(p, q, t) at a ﬁxed time t and then each
point on the curve moves along the Hamiltonian ﬂow to obtain a closed curve at later times, then the
rate of change of the integral is indeed identically zero (by Liouville’s theorem) but the later curve is no
longer of the form E = H(p, q, t) (for example, it does not remain elliptical in the case of the harmonic
oscillator).

The remaining equations are standard results: (13) comes from diﬀerentiating E = H(P (E, q, t), q, t)
partially with respect to E and (14) comes from diﬀerentiating this same equation partially with respect
to t.

Although we do not use the above calculation explicitly in the proof of adiabatic invariance of I, it
does provide a useful idea that underlies our method of proof. It is relatively easy to calculate I in any
given case, but it is not at all easy to determine its time dependence. Conversely, there are quantities
deﬁned by integrals closely related to I which are not easy to calculate, but the time-dependence of
which can be determined. The underlying idea of our proof is to deﬁne a quantity J that can be shown
to be close to I and whose time dependence can be determined.

4 Adiabatic invariance of I: the harmonic oscillator case

The proof of the adiabatic invariance of I for a general Hamiltonian presented in the next section is
quite diﬃcult to understand at ﬁrst because of the number of changes of variable and the diﬀerent
independent variables used. This is a problem common to all such proofs. Instead of starting with the
full proof, it makes sense to see how it works in the more restricted case of the harmonic oscillator:

We have used τ (t) as the slowly varying parameter rather than ω because it has the dimensions of time.

H(p, q, τ ) =

(p2 + q2/τ 2).

As mentioned above, the plan is to construct a quantity J which remains close to I in value as time

evolves, but whose time variation can be determined more easily.

The essence of the proof is to write the system in action-angle coordinates (I, φ) with the dynamics
governed by the Hamiltonian K(I, φ, τ ). Since K is not independent of time we construct an action
variable associated with this new Hamiltonian system. This new action variable J, is an average of I
over the cycle deﬁned by 0 6 φ 6 2π. If the system were independent of time, then I and J would
coincide. However when τ is varying they may be shown to diﬀer by an amount which is O( ˙τ ). The
time evolution of J is much slower than that of I and may be determined from the fact that K may be
written as a function of J and τ alone (this follows from the fact that J is the action variable derived
In this way we are able to deduce that J = O(¨τ , ˙τ 2) and the adiabatic
from the Hamiltonian K).
invariance of J and hence I may then be established.

We start by deﬁning a new pair of coordinates (I, φ) by

I is the adiabatic invariant deﬁned by the integral (2). It may easily be veriﬁed that if p and q satisfy
Hamilton’s equations with respect to the Hamiltonian (15), then I and φ satisfy Hamilton’s equations
with respect to the Hamiltonian

The coordinates (I, φ) are therefore canonical4.

written in terms of p, q and τ , or equivalently in terms of H and τ , we can write J in terms of I, φ and

This is the result we want. It shows that, if ˙τ and ¨τ are small, then J(t) will not vary much from

next section, once it has been determined exactly what is required from a formal deﬁnition of adiabatic
invariance.

5 Adiabatic invariance of I: the general case

First we need to adopt a deﬁnition of adiabatic invariance. The most useful one for our purposes is as
follows:

Let T be an arbitrary ﬁxed time, for all ǫ > 0 consider variations τ (t)

τ (ǫ, t) such that ˙τ = O(ǫ)
and ¨τ = O(ǫ2) (e.g., τ (t) = h(ǫt) for some function h). We say that a quantity I(t) is an adiabatic
invariant of the dynamical system if for all such variations of τ we have

6 Conclusion

The theory of adiabatic invariants is one of the more confusing aspects of Hamiltonian mechanics in
undergraduate courses on classical dynamics. An intuitive understanding of the concept is often all that
is given, and the subtleties ignored. For instance, as we point out, it is not true to say that an adiabatic
invariant varies much more slowly than the slowly-varying parameter. As we discussed in section 2, the
action variable typically has a rate of change comparable with that of the slowly-varying parameter.
However, over suitably deﬁned extended periods of time, the change in the adiabatic quantity is much
less than the typical change in the quantity being varied. It is in this rather precise sense that the
quantity is ‘invariant’.

The subtlety in formulating an adequate deﬁnition of adiabatic invariance means that a proof of
the adiabatic invariance of the action variable, for instance, will of necessity require a certain level of
sophistication. In section 3 we pointed out some of the problems encountered in attempts to prove
the result directly, i.e., without recourse to the more advanced theory of canonical transformations and
action-angle variables. Frequently attempts to prove the adiabatic invariance of the action variable
introduce a time averaging procedure; the average being taken over a time scale over which the system
is approximately periodic. One may then be tempted to replace the quantity I, which is a geometrical
construction given by an integral over a region in phase space bounded by a certain constant energy
contour, with an approximation to I based on the trajectory of the particle in question, a dynamical
construction requiring the use of Hamilton’s equations. This would make no diﬀerence if the system

were independent of time, but in the time dependent case, one is then left with the problem of keeping
track of the all the errors made in using these approximations.

In contrast, our new proof constructs J, a second action variable which has the natural interpretation
as the phase space average of I over all points on the constant energy contour, or more precisely, over the
angle variable. This is the analogue of the time-averaging procedure normally used. Perhaps naturally,
in light of the simplicity with which this ﬁts into the formalism of Hamiltonian mechanics, this leads to
a far clearer proof of the adiabatic invariance of action variable where error terms can be easily tracked
at every step of the proof.

We have used the harmonic oscillator to illustrate our proof and to emphasize the subtleties that
arise in the theory. For the simplest of variations Hamilton’s equations may be solved exactly in terms
of Airy functions. The asymptotic properties of these functions are well-known and lead to a concrete
example of the issues we have discussed in this paper. The harmonic oscillator with arbitrary adiabatic
variation is also simple enough to allow for all of the functions introduced in our general proof to be
written down in closed form. This provides a useful touchstone for readers following the general proof.

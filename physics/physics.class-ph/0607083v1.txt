The non linear desription of laminar premixed (cid:29)ames has been very su-

essful, beause of the existene of model equations desribing the dynamis

of these (cid:29)ames. The Mihelson Sivashinsky equation is the most well known

Abstrat

of these equations, and has been used in di(cid:27)erent geometries, inluding three-

dimensional quasi-planar and spherial (cid:29)ames. Another interesting model,

usually known as the Frankel equation, whih ould in priniple take into a-

ount large deviations of the (cid:29)ame front, has been used for the moment only

for two-dimensional expanding and Bunsen (cid:29)ames. We report here for the

(cid:28)rst time numerial solutions of this equation for three-dimensional (cid:29)ames.

Introdution

The Mihelson Sivashinsky equation, or simply Sivashinsky equation, depending on

the author [1℄, is a good example of a non linear model equation that has obtained

results far beyond any expetations. While originally derived for (cid:29)ames with a low

heat release (whih are rather rare indeed, sine in typial (cid:29)ames the burnt gases have

a temperature (cid:28)ve times higher than the fresh gases) this equation has sueeded

in providing a qualitative desription of the dynamis, even for large heat release.

This equation has been used for fronts in di(cid:27)erent geometries (planar on the average

[2℄, expanding (cid:29)ames[3℄, oblique (cid:29)ames [4℄), but with always the limitation that the

deviation (atually the variation of the slope) from the unperturbed geometry must

be relatively small, and that the front has to be desribed by a funtion (of the

lateral oordinate, of an angle ...)

Another possible desription [5℄ has been proposed in 1990 by Frankel and does

not su(cid:27)er from these drawbaks, i.e.

its formulation is oordinate-free, with no

privileged diretion. It was pointed out to the author by one referee that an approah

similar to Frankel's (using a potential approximation for the (cid:29)ame generated (cid:29)ow

(cid:28)eld) had already been used in a 1982 artile by Ghoniem, Chorin and Oppenheim

[6℄, whih ould justify hanging the name of the equation (usually alled Frankel

equation). However, ontrary to [5℄, the front was not desribed in a lagrangian way

3

by a set of markers, but was alulated using a SLIC method [7℄. Another di(cid:27)erene

is that turbulene was desribed in [6℄ with vortex methods. The two approahes

are thus not ompletely equivalent. However, it is true that several aspets of the

work of Frankel were used by other authors before the 1990 paper (see for instane

[8℄[9℄).

In [5℄, the (cid:29)ow is supposed potential everywhere, fresh and burnt gases, and

the problem is transformed into an integro-di(cid:27)erential equation involving Green's

funtions and the position of the front. This may at (cid:28)rst seem ompletely ridiulous;

after all, it is known that for large heat release, vortiity is generated at the front

and has to be present in the burnt gases, even if the (cid:29)ow is potential in the fresh

gases. But atually, this approximation is lose to the low heat release limit of

the Sivashinsky equation, and it has been shown in the 1990 Frankel artile (a

very important point of this paper) that this equation redues to the Sivashinsky

equation for plane on the average and irular (cid:29)ames. Surprising as it may seem, the

suess of the Sivashinsky equation is atually a (qualitative) suess of the potential

approximation. However, ontrary to the Sivashinsky equation, the Frankel equation

has not been for the moment derived rigorously from an expansion in powers of the

density ratio starting from the hydrodynami equations. Higher order expansions in

power of the density ratio have lead in the plane ase to the derivation of extensions

4

of the Sivashinsky equation [13℄ (see also [14℄). An alternative method has been

proposed [12℄ , based on a weak-nonlinearity approximation. This approximation

has been ritiized in [13℄.

The good qualitative agreement of the potential model with experiments (see

for instane the omparison in [10℄ or the (cid:28)gures of the urrent artile) is thus

less surprising: the same behavior is seen in the related Sivashinsky equation ase.

Naturally, the author does not laim that the agreement is quantitative, as the po-

tential approximation is well-known to hange the linear growth rate of the Landau

instability [11℄. For large heat release, the potential model does not satisfy the or-

ret onservation laws at the front, partiularly the pressure jump ondition, whih

explains this disrepany.

In this artile, however, we will limit ourselves to the potential model. Numerial

solutions of this equation for two dimensional (cid:29)ames are muh more di(cid:30)ult than

in the Mihelson Sivashinsky ase, where typially periodi boundary onditions

and fast Fourier transforms are used. In the oordinate-free ase, the front, whih

is a line, is disretized with di(cid:27)erent marker points, whih move beause of the

(cid:29)uid veloity and the (cid:29)ame speed. Nevertheless, simulations of this equation have

appeared in the expanding (cid:29)ame [16℄[17℄ [18℄[19℄ and the Bunsen burner ase[10℄.

But for the moment no numerial solution of this equation has been obtained for

5

three dimensional (cid:29)ames, where the front has to be desribed by a surfae and

not a line. On the ontrary, the Mihelson Sivashinsky equation has been solved

numerially for these (cid:29)ames (see for instane planar (cid:29)ame solutions without and

with gravity [2℄ [20℄ and a reent paper on spherial (cid:29)ames[21℄)

In this artile we will show the (cid:28)rst numerial solutions of the Frankel equation

for three dimensional (cid:29)ames, in the Bunsen burner geometry. The equation will be

presented, along with some tehnial details of the numerial solution. Then results

for (cid:29)ames with di(cid:27)erent forings and for polyhedral (cid:29)ames will be shown.

2 Model and numerial method

Let us (cid:28)rst reall some notations. The (cid:29)ame veloity relative to premixed gases

will be noted ul ( and will have the onstant value 1 in all the simulations presented

in this artile) . If we de(cid:28)ne ρu the density of fresh gases, ρb the density of burnt

gases, γ = ρu−ρb

ρu

is a parameter measuring gas expansion (γ = 0 without exothermi

reations, γ being lose to 1 for large gas expansion). This di(cid:27)erene in density

between fresh and burnt gases is the main ause of the Darrieus-Landau instability

of premixed (cid:29)ames. We use in this artile an equation relative to fresh gases, in the

Bunsen burner geometry, as in [10℄, ontrary to the original artile [5℄, where the

6

equation was written relative to burnt gases for the ase of an expanding (cid:29)ame. The

unburnt gases are injeted at the veloity U . We will onsider in Setion 3 that U is

onstant in spae and that the (cid:29)ame is attahed on a irle (i.e. we de(cid:28)ne points on

this irle that do not move during the simulation). In Setion 4, on the ontrary,

we shall see that in order to obtain the polyhedral (cid:29)ames observed experimentally,

a boundary layer has to be onsidered.

κ is the mean urvature at a given point on the (cid:29)ame , ε is a onstant number

proportional to the Markstein length,

−→
n is the normal vetor at the urrent point

on the front, in the diretion of propagation. After some alulations similar to [5℄,

an evolution equation is obtained, valid for an arbitrary shape of the front, whih is

here a surfae, ontrary to [10℄, where it was only a line.

This equation gives the value of the normal veloity V on the front as a sum

of several terms, the laminar (cid:29)ame veloity with urvature orretions, the veloity

of the inoming veloity (cid:28)eld and an indued veloity (cid:28)eld (all the terms where γ

appears) whih ontains an integral over the whole shape (indiated by the subsript

S in the integral ). This integral is a sum of eletrostati potentials.

to the equation in order to satisfy the boundary onditions. Here the ondition is

The di(cid:27)erent marker points of the surfae are linked by triangles. A LGPL

C library, gts [22℄ written by Stéphane Popinet, has been used to desribe the

triangulated surfae, perform the integrals in equation (1), and alulate the mean

urvature and the normal at any given point. The alulation of the urvature is

done by a method proposed in [23℄. Let us note that gts itself is implemented using

8

glib, a well-known general purpose library that is also used diretly from the author's

program in order to manipulate lists and hash tables. A zoom of a surfae shown

later (from a di(cid:27)erent angle) in Figure 3 (right part of the (cid:28)gure) an be seen in

Figure 1. As we use a large number of points, typially 20000, the di(cid:27)erent points

annot be seen if the whole mesh is shown.

Problems typially enountered in Lagrangian desriptions of two-dimensional

(cid:29)ames as disontinuities [24℄ [25℄ are also present here. First of all, there is a need

to adapt the mesh, adding and removing points where neessary. As a result, the

type of algorithm used here is inherently noisy, and the noise is higher when there is

a rapid time variation. On the other hand, the spatial preision of these Lagrangian

desriptions is generally higher than for Eulerian methods, but there is the problem

of self-intersetions, whih our very often and must be aounted for. One of the

interest of this artile is to show that it an be done even for three-dimensional

(cid:29)ames.

As in [24℄, we perform the reonnetions after the intersetion has taken plae:

we (cid:28)rst detet the triangles that self-interset (this is atually a gts funtion, whih

is performed in an e(cid:30)ient way), then these triangles are removed from the surfae

(exept on the boundary). We also remove triangles whih are not onneted any-

more to the main surfae after the (cid:28)rst triangle removals. At this stage, the surfae

9

has one or more holes. We detet the ontours of the di(cid:27)erent holes, and onstrut

small surfae pathes whih are added to the main surfae. At this stage, the surfae

has no hole left, but the pathes an have normals oriented in the wrong diretion.

In order to get a ommon orientation for the whole surfae, we traverse the surfae

starting from the boundary, looking in a reursive way at eah neighbor of a given

triangle in order to ensure that the orientation of the whole surfae is ompatible.

In the simulations that will be presented, we remove pokets reated during self-

intersetions, but atually it would have been very simple to keep pokets with a

su(cid:30)ient number of points. We have programmed a funtion splitting a surfae in

its onnex omponents, whih are then sorted aording to their number of points.

Instead of keeping only the main surfae (with the largest number of points), it

would have been only a matter of two lines of ode to apply a di(cid:27)erent riterion.

But the previous experiene of the author with two-dimensional (cid:29)ames desribed

in a Lagrangian way has shown that the formation of pokets is generally not very

important, exept oasionally and for very speial forings. But it is important to

disard very small pokets, whih an produe all kind of disagreements:

further

(absolutely unrealisti) splitting of small pokets whih fores to redue the time

step, and global inversion of the normal of a small poket, whih atually would have

ollapsed had the time step been smaller. For real (cid:29)ames naturally, the (cid:29)ame speed

10

is higher when two fronts are very lose, whih let these small pokets disappear

quikly.

Another problem of these simulations, one the intersetions are under ontrol,

is that the alulations of the integral in equation (1) is very expensive, if done

exatly. The problem is exatly an N-body problem (oulombian interation), where

an exat solution for N points, is proportional to N 2

. As has been already done

in a ombustion ontext [17℄, it is possible to use approximate algorithms whih

redue the number of operations. The author himself had always used the exat

algorithm when solving the potential model for two-dimensional (cid:29)ames, but the extra

dimension has fored him to look at alternatives. There are two main approximate

algorithms for the N-body problem. The Greengard and Rokhlyn algorithm [26℄

(fast multipole expansion) approximates the (cid:28)eld by a multipole expansion, the

algorithm is O(N) but the prefator is very high. We have preferred to use the

Barnes Hut algorithm [27℄ whih is O (N log N). The idea of this algorithm is to

represent the (cid:28)eld at a given point by the ation of a list of masses, where masses

su(cid:30)iently far are onatenated in order to provide a good approximation of the

(cid:28)eld, the masses at the di(cid:27)erent levels being organized in a tree. The soure ode

of this algorithm an be found in Joshua Barnes' web site [28℄.

3 Flames in the presene of foring

We onsider here Bunsen burner (cid:29)ames, with position of the (cid:29)ame imposed on

the boundary, i.e. the boundary point must be on a irle of radius R (in all the

simulations, the value R=0.5 will be hosen) with a value z=0 (z is the vertial

oordinate). Other boundary onditions will be onsidered in setion 4. In a (cid:28)rst

step, we would like to show that the three-dimensional Frankel equation ontains

e(cid:27)ets qualitatively similar to those observed with the two-dimensional version in

the same geometry [10℄. The last artile ontained evidene of the ampli(cid:28)ation and

saturation of ells reated by the Darrieus-Landau instability, whih were onveted

toward the tip of the (cid:29)ame by the inoming (cid:29)ow. Furthermore, a repulsion e(cid:27)et of

the side of the (cid:29)ame where foring was imposed on the other side was observed in

the simulations. This e(cid:27)et was very lose to the experimental observations of [29℄.

Here, instead of having a two-dimensional geometry, i.e. a very long retangular

Bunsen (cid:29)ame where the foring is the same on the long side, we have the usual

round burner Bunsen (cid:29)ame.

Let us impose a loalized foring on the (cid:29)ame. We take a sinusoidal foring, where

a term 2 sin (ωt) is added to the normal veloity, in a small window z ∈ [ 0.4, 0.45]

θ ∈ [ 0, π/10], θ being the polar angle. We take the value ω = 200 whih is rather

high, but allows to form several wavelengths on the (cid:29)ame. The other parameters are

12

U = 12, γ = 0.85, ε = 0.1. The last parameter and the radius will have the same

value in all the simulations presented. The time step is ∆t = 5 10−5

and will keep

the same value in all the simulations. This value of the time step is hosen to keep

the self-intersetions ourring on the front simple. If the time step is too high, very

large self-intersetions an our at eah time step lose to the tip and the preision

of the lagrangian desription beomes low. We obtain a situation presented in Figure

2. This (cid:28)gure ontains three (cid:29)ames. Atually, we had some di(cid:30)ulties in produing

di(cid:27)erent (cid:28)gures of (cid:29)ames with the same sale, so we have inluded several (cid:29)ames in

the same (cid:28)gures. This also makes omparisons easier. The two (cid:29)ames on the left

are the same, but seen from a di(cid:27)erent angle, and orrespond to a (cid:29)ame soon after

the perturbations produed by the Darrieus-Landau instability reah the tip. If one

looks (cid:28)rst at the middle image, it an be seen that the sinusoidal foring is very

loalized and produes a small perturbation lose to the base of the Bunsen (cid:29)ame.

But this perturbation develops, is ampli(cid:28)ed beause of the Landau instability, is

onveted toward the tip and extends laterally, whih was of ourse not observed in

two-dimensional experiments and simulations. It is also to be noted that the ells

produed by the instability, one su(cid:30)iently developed, have a geometry very lose

to the hexagonal ells well-known in the planar on average on(cid:28)guration. However,

when the ell is near the tip, this hexagonal shape beomes less apparent and the

13

ell an be loser from a retangle.

If one looks now at the side view of the same (cid:29)ame (left of Figure 2), the repulsion

e(cid:27)et of the side submitted to perturbations on the other seen in two-dimensional

on(cid:28)gurations is also present here. As a onsequene, there is a slow de(cid:29)etion of

the unperturbed side toward the right. This repulsion e(cid:27)et was explained quali-

tatively by an eletrostati analogy in [10℄ (let us remember that the model used

here is potential). But here this de(cid:29)etion seems smaller, and is seen learly only

when the lateral extension of the perturbations is su(cid:30)iently large. Atually, the

two-dimensional situation orresponds to a lateral extent in(cid:28)nite in the transverse

diretion, whih explains why in the three-dimensional ase, a large lateral extent is

needed to obtain the same e(cid:27)et.

The third (cid:29)ame image (right of Figure 2), is a (cid:29)ame with the same physial

parameters, but some time later. This (cid:29)ame is higher (the height of the (cid:29)ame

(cid:29)utuates typially in this way during the temporal evolution). But the main e(cid:27)et

is that two ells are merging lose to the tip. Apparently, the way we have imposed

the foring does not produe absolutely regular ells, possibly beause the foring

zone is too extended. It has happened that one ell had a smaller amplitude lose

to the base of the (cid:29)ame, and during its translation toward the tip, its amplitude

and longitudinal extension have slowly redued, and now learly this ell (seond

14

ell from the tip, whih is very small) is being aptured by the third ell, whih is

very large. This ell merging is absolutely typial of the Landau instability and is

well known in the planar on(cid:28)guration, where it helps produe the one-ell (cid:29)ame

obtained for every domain size in the Mihelson-Sivashinsky equation. Atually, for

very large (cid:29)ame height, self-similar mergings have been predited theoretially [14℄

[4℄.

After this study of the e(cid:27)et of a sinusoidal foring on the (cid:29)ame, we are now

interested in the e(cid:27)et of a white noise foring applied at the base of the (cid:29)ame

(su(cid:30)iently far from the boundary to prevent problems). To be spei(cid:28), we have

added to the normal veloity at points where z ∈ [ 0.4, 0.6] a term 20 ∗ rnd, where

rnd is a random number hosen between 0 and 1. The white noise is di(cid:27)erent at

eah time step and at eah point of the mesh. Beause the noise is not orrelated

in spae and time, the amplitude must be taken muh higher than in the sinusoidal

ase (a lot of the wavelengths generated by this white noise are quikly damped by

di(cid:27)usion and we wanted to produe a very perturbed (cid:29)ame).

The result of this white noise is shown in Figure 3. We present also here two

(cid:29)ames. The (cid:29)ame on the left is a totally unstationary (cid:29)ame obtained soon after

the (cid:28)rst perturbations reah the tip. The physial parameters are U = 12, γ =

0.85, and as usual ε = 0.1 R = 0.5.The initial ondition of this alulation was

15

a stationary, unperturbed (cid:29)ame, with slightly di(cid:27)erent parameters. Starting from

the base of the (cid:29)ame, the (cid:28)ne grained perturbations diretly aused by the white

noise are (cid:28)rst seen. Then these perturbations develop beause of the instability,

leading to ells where this time, it is di(cid:30)ult to reognize any hexagon. Then as

in the sinusoidal ase, the wavelength of the ells inrease beause of ell merging.

These mergings do not neessary happen in the same way as the one in Figure 2,

where a small ell was swallowed by a large one. More symmetrial situations are

also possible, where the separation between ells disappear with both ells having

approximately the same size. Finally, when the tip is approahed, the perturbations

organize in order to produe a sinuous shape.

This kind of sinuous shape was also observed for two-dimensional (cid:29)ames [10℄,

and an explanation was proposed. But this sinuous harater beomes smaller for

typial (cid:29)ames obtained later. We have an example of one typial (cid:29)ame in the right

part of the (cid:28)gure. The foring zone, (cid:28)rst ells, wavelength inrease and (cid:28)nally

sinuous zone an also be seen.

It must be admitted however that the (cid:29)ame is

muh less sinuous than the (cid:29)ame on the left. The main ause of this di(cid:27)erene is

that as the perturbations develop, the (cid:29)ame height beomes smaller, whih an be

observed when one ompares the two (cid:29)ames in the (cid:28)gure. We an also insist on

the three-dimensional struture of the sinuous zone to just say that the shape is

16

almost never truly helial (the author was thinking at the beginning of this work

that it was the natural generalization of the sinuous two-dimensional shape, but this

is apparently not the ase). Before losing this setion, one last word, even if we

have not performed simulations of turbulent (cid:29)ames, the two (cid:29)ames of Figure 3 an

give us some hope that it an be done with the urrent three-dimensional model.

But naturally, it would be very expensive, sine it is neessary to either simulate or

generate a substitute of turbulent (cid:29)ow. Future growth in omputer power will help,

the omputations of this artile being done on a relatively standard PC (2.8 Ghz

Pentium 4). It must be noted that the (cid:29)ame lagrangian surfae solver used in this

artile (cid:28)ts naturally with a lagrangian desription of vortiity.

4 Polyhedral (cid:29)ames

In the previous setion, the positions of the boundary points were imposed and the

injetion veloity was onstant. This is a reasonable approximation of a (cid:29)ame with

a very small boundary layer. In this setion however, we are interested in polyhedral

(cid:29)ames, whih are well-known experimentally, see for instane [30℄. A theoretial (and

experimental, but we will be mainly interested in the theoretial part) artile has

appeared some time ago [30℄ on this sub jet. The polyhedral (cid:29)ames were desribed

17

by using a modi(cid:28)ed version of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, i.e. making the

assumption that the instability was of thermal-di(cid:27)usive origin. This type of model

was able to produe polyhedral (cid:29)ames, whih is the way ellular (cid:29)ames look like

in the Bunsen burner geometry (the following (cid:28)gures show these type of (cid:29)ames).

However, with the boundary onditions used in the previous setion, we have not

been able to produe polyhedral (cid:29)ames, although we have not made an extensive

searh, for a lot of parameters (the alulations for three-dimensional (cid:29)ames are

expensive).

So we are faed with a problem. It would not be a nie situation to onlude

that the thermal di(cid:27)usive instability gives more realisti results than the hydrody-

nami one, as the author, among others, has laimed in di(cid:27)erent papers that the

hydrodynami mehanism is the most realisti. And although not everyone agrees

even now, a ommon belief seems to be that the thermal di(cid:27)usive mehanism ould

only aount for speial ases, like lean hydrogen (cid:29)ames. This is probably why the

experiments in [31℄ were performed with hydrogen.

Before onluding that the hydrodynami model does not ontain polyhedral

(cid:29)ames, there is another thing di(cid:27)erent in [31℄ from the simulations of the previous

setion : the boundary onditions. In [31℄, the vertial position of the boundary

points was not imposed, and a (cid:29)ame-holder term was added, following Bukmaster

18

[32℄, to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, in order to modelize attration of the

(cid:29)ame to the burner rim.

So let us just apply here these same onditions. However, we shall not apply

these onditions unmodi(cid:28)ed, as we have a slight problem. The vertial oordinate

on the boundary is (cid:28)xed by an equilibrium between the injetion veloity, supposed

onstant everywhere, and the (cid:29)ame-holder term (and also the integral terms in

equation 1). As a result we have found, and atually it an be seen in the original

artile, that the stationary position of the (cid:29)ame is very far from the (cid:29)ame holder.

We propose here, in order to desribe (cid:29)ames stabilized lose to the injetion zone,

to shift this stationary position toward the (cid:29)ame holder by inluding the fat that

there is a boundary layer, and that as a result the injetion veloity lose to the

boundary is muh smaller than in the middle of the tube.

We use the following formula for the injetion veloity:

u(r, z) = U − 0.9U exp

− (a (r − R) /R)
(cid:16)

4

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

− βz exp

− (a (r − R) /R)

(2)

4

(cid:17)

where U is the injetion veloity at the enter of the tube, a and β are onstant

oe(cid:30)ients.

. The (cid:28)rst exponential term is there to desribe the boundary layer.

The β term is the (cid:29)ame holder term used in [31℄. The exponential variation with r is

the one used in this paper, with oe(cid:30)ient a ontrolling the sti(cid:27)ness and width of the

boundary layer (proportional to the inverse of the width). Furthermore, ontrary to

19

the previous setion, just on the boundary, the x and y oordinates keep the same

values, but not the z oordinate, whih is free to move, being atually omputed as

a mean value over the neighbors.

In Figure 4, we show that these modi(cid:28)ations of the boundary onditions sueed

in making polyhedral (cid:29)ames possible with the Frankel equation. So what is atually

important for these (cid:29)ames is not the mehanism in itself, hydrodynami or thermal-

di(cid:27)usive, but what happens lose to the boundary, boundary layer, (cid:29)ame holder

term. Atually two (cid:29)ames an be seen in Figure 4 with parameters γ = 0.85,

ε = 0.1 R=0.5, a = 2, β = 0.4,U = 12, (left) and U = 6(right). These

parameters only di(cid:27)er in the injetion veloity, showing that, as also observed in

the thermal-di(cid:27)usive ase, this parameter does not signi(cid:28)antly hange the ellular

struture of the (cid:29)ame. The eight ells left solution was obtained by taking as initial

ondition a (cid:29)ame with no ell, but the eight ells solution on the right was atually

obtained starting from the solution on the left, and apparently this solution is never

ompletely stationary, as seen in the Figure.

In [31℄, it was also observed that the parameter β , was more important than

U , and leads to a well-de(cid:28)ned transition. As β is inreased, the (cid:29)ame is no more

ellular. This is also the ase here in the hydrodynami ase, see Figure 5, where

two (cid:29)ames are shown, the one on the left with β = 0.4 (same (cid:29)ame as in Figure 4,

20

left) , and on the right with β = 20, all the other parameters being the same. It an

be seen that although this inrease in β sueeds in smoothing the (cid:29)ame, the typial

values ahieving this result are very high. We have not searhed the preise value of

the bifuration, but for instane the (cid:29)ame is still weakly ellular with β = 8. This

very high value has the onsequene that the (cid:29)ame is loser from the injetion (and

above all, loser for a longer distane from the boundary, whih is why the (cid:29)ame

height is smaller) and very (cid:29)at lose to the boundary, whih apparently makes this

zone stable. On the ontrary, for the small values of β used in the other simulations

of this artile, the role of the (cid:29)ame holder term seems small.

We have also here another parameter, the width of the boundary layer, whih did

not appear in [31℄. In Figure 6, the e(cid:27)et of this parameter is shown. We take a = 2

(left, large boundary layer), a = 4 (right, smaller boundary layer) and U = 12,

γ = 0.84, ε = 0.1 R=0.5, β = 0.4. Larger boundary layers orrespond to more

unstable (cid:29)ames, a predition whih an tested experimentally (with some aution,

i.e. without hanging the (cid:29)ame holder term). This e(cid:27)et ould also help explain why

it is observed experimentally that larger injetion veloities (and smaller boundary

layers) lead to (cid:29)ames without any ell. It is unlear at the moment if this e(cid:27)et is

su(cid:30)ient in itself to explain this stabilization.

This e(cid:27)et suggests the following interpretation of the formation of polyhedral

21

Bunsen (cid:29)ames. The ellular perturbations form in the boundary layer. This zone

is probably absolutely unstable, and large boundary layers give more time for the

perturbations to develop, whih thus have a larger amplitude at the exit of this zone.

Then the perturbations enter another zone, probably orresponding to a onvetive

instability, and are onveted toward the tip. If the perturbations have not reahed

their amplitude at saturation in the boundary layer, they an ontinue to amplify

during this seond phase, leading to ells whih appear at a ertain distane from

the base of the (cid:29)ame, as in Figure 6 (right), where these ells are very weak. These

type of solutions have indeed been experimentally observed in [31℄ (not in their

simulations however). If one follows this line of reasoning, the boundary layer width

should be ompared to typial unstable wavelengths ( most unstable or neutral

wavevetors).

If this width is muh smaller than the unstable wavelengths, the

polyhedral (cid:29)ames should be unlikely to be observed. This piture is ompliated

by the e(cid:27)et of the (cid:29)ame holder term (Figure 5) whih probably hanges loally

the unstable wavelengths, one e(cid:27)et being that (cid:29)ames lose to the injetion are also

loser from their mirror image, whih damps the Landau instability.

22

5 Conlusion

In this artile, we have solved for the (cid:28)rst time the Frankel equation for three-

dimensional (cid:29)ames, in the partiular ase of the Bunsen burner on(cid:28)guration. This

daunting task has been made possible in a reasonable amount of time by using tools

(triangulated surfae library and N-body problem algorithm) made freely available

by their authors, see below the aknowledgments and the referenes setions. Even

with this help, the treatment of intersetions is by no means easy, and our program

far from perfet. We have tried to explain here the algorithms used to overome

these di(cid:30)ulties. Extensions to other geometries and to turbulent onditions would

be interesting.

On the Bunsen burner ase, we have shown that this equation an at the same

time desribe e(cid:27)ets absolutely typial of the hydrodynami Darrieus-Landau in-

stability (Setion 3) and also desribe polyhedral (cid:29)ames (setion 4) in a manner

very lose to the existing results obtained with the thermal-di(cid:27)usive instability. We

have also emphasized the possible importane of the boundary layer width in this

problem.

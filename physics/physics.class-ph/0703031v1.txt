Omega and the time evolution of the n-body problem

The series solution of the behavior of a ﬁnite number of physical bodies
and Chaitin’s Omega number share quasi-algorithmic expressions; yet
both lack a computable radius of convergence.

1.1. Solutions to the n–body problem

The behaviour and evolution of a ﬁnite number of bodies is a sort of “rosetta
stone” of classical celestial mechanics insofar as its investigation induced a
lot of twists, revelations and unexpected issues. Arguably the most radical
deterministic position on the subject was formulated by Laplace, stating
that [1, Chapter II] “We ought then to regard the present state of the uni-
verse as the eﬀect of its anterior state and as the cause of the one which
is to follow. Given for one instant an intelligence which could comprehend
all the forces by which nature is animated and the respective situation of
the beings who compose it an intelligence suﬃciently vast to submit these
data to analysis it would embrace in the same formula the movements of
the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the lightest atom; for it,
nothing would be uncertain and the future, as the past, would be present to
its eyes.”

In what may be considered as the beginning of deterministic chaos the-
ory, Poincar´e was forced to accept a gradual departure from the determin-
istic position: sometimes small variations in the initial state of the bodies
could lead to huge variations in their evolution in later times. In Poincar´e’s
own words [2, Chapter 4, Sect. II, pp. 56-57], “If we would know the laws of
Nature and the state of the Universe precisely for a certain time, we would

be able to predict with certainty the state of the Universe for any later time.
But [[ . . . ]] it can be the case that small diﬀerences in the initial values pro-
duce great diﬀerences in the later phenomena; a small error in the former
may result in a large error in the latter. The prediction becomes impossible
and we have a ‘random phenomenon.’ ”

In what follows we present an even more radical departure from Lapla-
cian determinism. A physical system of a ﬁnite number of bodies capable
of universal computation will be presented which has the property that
certain propositions remain not only provable intractable, but provable un-
knowable. Pointedly stated, our knowledge of any such system remains in-
complete forever. For the sake of making things worse, we shall “compress”
and “compactify” this kind of physical incompleteness by considering phys-
ical observables which are truly random, i.e., algorithmically incompressible
and stochastic.

The methods of construction of physical n–body observables exhibiting
the above features turn out to be rather humble and straightforward. In
a ﬁrst step, it suﬃces to reduce the problem to the halting problem for
universal computation. This can be achieved by “embedding” a universal
computer into a suitable physical system of a ﬁnite number of bodies. The
associated ballistic computation will be presented in the next section. In a
second reduction step, the universal computer will be directed to attempt to
“compute” Chaitin’s Omega number, which is provable random, and which
is among the “most diﬃcult” tasks imaginable. Finally, consequences for
the series solutions3–6 to the general n-body problem will be discussed.

1.2. Reduction by ballistic computation

In order to embed reversible universal computation into a quasi-physical en-
vironment, Fredkin and Toﬀoli introduced a “billiard ball model”7–10 based
on the collisions of spheres as well as on mirrors reﬂecting the spheres. Thus
collisions and reﬂections are the basic ingredients for building universal
computation.

If we restrict ourselves to classical gravitational potentials without col-
lisions, we do not have any repulsive interaction at our disposal; only at-
tractive 1/r potentials. Thus the kinematics corresponding to reﬂections
and collisions has to be realized by purely attractive interactions. Fig. 1.1a)
depicts a Fredkin gate realized by attractive interaction which corresponds
to the analogue billiard ball conﬁguration achieved by collisions (e.g., [8,
Fig. 4.5]). At points A and B and time ti, two bodies are either put at both

locations A and B; or alternatively, one body is put at only one location,
or no bodies are placed at all. If bodies are present at both A and B, then
they will follow the right paths at later times tf . In case only one body
is present at A or B, only one of the dotted inner outgoing paths will be
used. Boolean logic can be implemented by the presence or absence of balls.

mass. For a proof of universality, we refer to the classical papers on the

billiard ball model cited above.

1.3. Undecidability and Omega in the n-body problem

By reduction to the recursive unsolvability of the rule inference11–15 and
the halting16–18 problems, the general induction and forecasting problem of
the n-body ballistic universal computer sketched above is provable unsolv-
able. That is, there exist initial conﬁgurations for which it is impossible to
predict with certainty whether or not certain “ﬁnal” states will eventually
be reached. Moreover, given a ﬁnite segment of the time evolution alone
is in general insuﬃcient for a derivation of the initial state conﬁguration of
the n-body problem.

For the sake of making things worse, we imagine an n-body system at-

tempting to evaluate its associated halting probability Omega.19–21 In order
to establish the equivalent of preﬁx-free programs, only a limited number of
n-body initial conﬁgurations contribute to the conﬁguration. Furthermore,
as the computation is reversible and procedural, certain “ﬁnal” conﬁgura-
tions must be deﬁned as halting states. This is a feature shared with the
billiard ball model, as well as with quantum computation.

1.4. Consequences for series solutions

Wang’s power series solution to the n-body problem4,6 may converge “very
slowly”.5 Indeed, by considering the halting problems above, and in par-
ticular by reduction to the computation of the halting probability Omega,
certain physical observables associated with the n-body problem do not
have a power series solution with a computable radius of convergence.

This is a particular case of Specker’s theorems in recursive analysis,
stating that there exist recursive monotone bounded sequences of rational
numbers whose limit is no computable number;22 and there exist a recursive
real function which has its maximum in the unit interval at no recursive
real number.23

It is important to realize that, while it may be possible to evaluate
the state of the n bodies by Wang’s power series solution for any ﬁnite
time with a computable, though excessively large, radius of convergence,
global observables, referring to all times, may be uncomputable. Examples
of global observables are, for instance, associated with the stability of the
solar system and associated with it, bounds for the orbits.

This, of course, stems from the metaphor and robustness of universal
computation and the capacity of the n-body problem to implement uni-
versality. It is no particularity and peculiarity of Wang’s power series so-
lution. Indeed, the troubles reside in the capabilities to implement Peano
arithmetic and universal computation by n-body problems. Because of this
capacity, there cannot exist other formalizable methods, analytic solutions
or approximations capable to decide and compute certain decision problems
or observables for the n-body problem.

Chaitin’s Omega number, the halting probability for universal comput-
ers, has been invented in a totally diﬀerent, unrelated algorithmic context,
and with intentions in mind which are seemingly diﬀerent from issues in
classical mechanics. Thus it is fascinating that Omega is also relevant for
the prediction of the behaviour and the movement of celestial bodies.

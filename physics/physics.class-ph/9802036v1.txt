Abstract

We present a computational model for Szilard’s engine and the information
discarding process. Taking advantage of a fact that the one is essentially the
reversed cycle of the other, we can discuss the both by employing the same
model. Through numerical simulations we calculate the work extracted by the
engine and the heat generation in the information discarding process. It is
found that these quantities depend on some realistic ingredients, which means
that the work done by the engine is no longer canceled by the heat generation
in the information erasure.

In 1876, Maxwell invented an external agent which utilizes information to extract the
work from a single heat bath as a perpetual cycle [1]. It is now known as Maxwell’s demon.
One of the simplest conﬁgurations related to Maxwell’s demon was presented by Szilard
[2]. It consists of one molecule captured in a cylinder in contact with a heat bath. The
demon inserts the piston in the middle of the cylinder, observes which side the molecule is
in, and then expand it to extract the work from the heat bath. After the expansion, the
demon removes the piston and repeats the same manipulation. Based on some assumptions,
Szilard showed that the work of kBT log 2 can be extracted per one cycle. This cycle seems
to violate the second law of thermodynamics and has provoked many arguments among
physicists since presented [3].

Most of the physicists sought heat generation outside of the engine. In particular Bril-
louin [4] studied concrete measurement processes and attempted to prove that such mea-
surements should be accompanied by heat generation. Although his argument is attractive,
one can always counterargue that there may be another measurement process without heat
generation. Indeed Bennett suggested that reversible measurements are possible and pro-
posed a new interpretation for the Maxwell’s demon problem [5]. His argument is as follows.
For the total system to be a complete cycle, the information of the preceding cycle stored
in the manipulator must be discarded before succeeding cycles. Following to the Landauer’s
claim, logically irreversible processes such as information erasure should be accompanied by
heat generation at least kBT log 2 per bit [6]. It might be plausible that the extracted work
of kBT log 2 by utilizing 1-bit information is compensated by heat generation of 1-bit infor-
mation erasure. Owing to their cancelation, the total system is expected to be consistent
with the second law.

While the above argument seems reasonable, we have some doubts about the evalua-
tion of the extracted work by the engine and generated heat in memory erasure, because
the thermodynamic nature of the information might depend on its physical embodiment.
Especially the discussions so far are conﬁned to idealized situation by means of thought ex-
periments. In this Letter, we study energetics of computational models for Szilard’s engine
and information erasure by taking some realistic components into account.

First, we present a computational model for Szilard’s engine. Our model is one dimen-
sional so that we can describe this system by a velocity and a position of the piston V, X
and ones of the particle v, x. (See Fig. 1.) Let the mass of the particle and the piston be
m and M, respectively. The position of the particle is restricted to the region −L < x < L,
where L is the half length of the cylinder. We assume evolution equations for X and x as

where ξ(t) is Gaussian white noise whose statistical properties are characterized by hξ(t)i = 0
and hξ(t)ξ(t′)i = 2ζkBT δ(t − t′). g(t) and f (t) are the momentum transfer per unit time
from the particle to the heat bath and to the piston, respectively.

g(t) is given implicitly by a stochastic rule at the boundaries x = ±L in such a way
that the particle is reﬂected being assigned new velocity v at random with the probability
distribution function

φ(v) =

exp[−

].

The distribution of the particle velocity turns out to be Maxwellian when there is only a
single particle in the system [7]. Note that the piston is assumed not to undergo the reﬂection
at the boundary.

The form of f (t) is given on the assumption that the piston and the particle collide

elastically. After a collision of the particle and the piston, they become

where ǫ ≡ m/M. Since the momentum transfer from the particle to the piston is 2m(v −
V )/(1 + ǫ), we obtain

where δ(t) denotes Dirac’s delta function and ti represents the time when i-th collision takes
place.

The demon manipulates the piston through a trapping potential U(x, t). We assume the

form of the potential as

The form of X0(t) is given as the demon’s manipulation. In this paper, we assume

where the choice of the sign in the time interval 0 ≤ t ≤ τ depends on the relative position
of the particle to the piston. (The sign is positive for X > x, while negative for x < X.) The
sign of X0(t) during τ ≤ t ≤ 2τ is determined so that X0(t) becomes continuous. Further,
the piston is assumed to be removed at t = τ and to be reinserted at t = 2τ . f (t) becomes
zero during τ ≤ t ≤ 2τ , which means that the piston is outside of the cylinder. In this way,
the demon can repeat cycles. The manipulation by the demon is shown in Fig. 2.

Note that l can be larger value than L, because the piston can collide with the particle
even if |X0(t)| > L. Yet, since the diﬀerence of physical quantities such as work and heat
between l = L and l > L is expected to be negligible when k is large enough to localize the
piston, hereafter we let l = L.

Next we present a computational model for a memory erasing process. We ﬁrst notice
that such a process can be designed as the reversed one of a Szilard’s cycle. Initially, the
piston is assumed to be in the middle of the cylinder. The particle is conﬁned in one side
(left or right) of it, which encodes an informational bit. After the piston is removed, it is
reinserted in the left end of the cylinder and moved to the middle. The particle is now in

3

the right side. This operation turns out to be the reversed one of a Szilard’s cycle as shown
in Fig. 3, and to be a logically irreversible process to discard the information at the initial
state (left or right) as shown in Fig .4. Since we already have a computational model for
Szilard cycles, we can easily realize the reversed Szilard cycle by employing the above model
given by Eqs. (1) and (2). All assumptions are the same except for the manipulation of the
piston such that

X0(t) =

−Lt/τ
L(t/τ − 2) (τ ≤ t ≤ 2τ ).

(0 ≤ t ≤ τ )

(

We also note that f (t) = 0 when 0 ≤ t ≤ τ .

We now discuss the energetics of our model. We ﬁrst assume that the removement and
the reinsertion of the piston cost no energy. The validity of this assumption can be proved by
analyzing a suitable model for this process [9]. On this assumption, we study the energetics
of Eqs. (1) and (2). We follow the energetic interpretation for Langevin equations, which
has been proposed by Sekimoto recently [8]. By multiplying Eqs. (1) and (2) by V (t)dt and
v(t)dt respectively and integrating over one cycle, we obtain

These integrals are assumed as Stratonovich calculus for the following discussions being
valid. We analyze Eq.(10) ﬁrst. The ﬁrst term of the left-handed side is written as the
kinetic energy diﬀerence denoted by ∆K ≡ ∆MV 2/2. We can rewrite the second term as

which corresponds to the work done by the engine.

The ﬁrst two terms of the right-handed side of Eq. (10) is denoted by −Q1, where Q1 is
interpreted to be the energy dissipation to the heat bath. The last term then corresponds
to the energy gain from the particle, which is denoted by C, that is,

Then, Eq. (10) becomes

g(t)v(t)dt is the energy transfer from the particle to the heat bath and
where Q2 = −
∆K ′ is a kinetic energy increase of the particle. The total generated heat Q, the energy
transferred from the system to the heat bath, is given by

R

Using these notations, we have en energy conservation law

∆K + ∆K ′ + ∆U + W + Q = 0.

Note that this expression holds for each of succeeding cycles. By taking an average over
many cycles, we obtain

∆K ′ = −C − Q2,

Q = Q1 + Q2.

hW i + hQi = 0.

In the argument below, hi denotes the average over many cycles.

Now we are ready to perform numerical simulations. We calculated the time evolution
by a second order Runge-Kutta method. We let kBT = 1, M = 1, and L = 1 for non-
dimensionization and hence dimensionless parameters are ǫ, k, ζ and τ . We are particularly
concerned with the ǫ dependence of the work by the engine hW ie and the heat generation in
the memory hQim. In Fig.5, we plotted the result of simulations with the parameter values
τ = 10, k = 100 and ζ = 0.1. For large ǫ, the work and the heat generation goes below from
kBT log 2. It is also found that we get less work with smaller k. Our simulations suggest
that the maximum work kBT log 2 is obtainable in the limit of ǫ → 0, k → ∞ and τ → ∞.
These results show that the compensation does not occur unless we adopt exactly the
same ǫ for the engine and the memory. Moreover, total heat absorption in the engine cycle
and the memory reset process is possible. Hence the interpretation of Maxwell’s demon
problem by Bennett and Landauer [5] is not applicable to this model.

Furthermore, owing to the operationally inverse relation between the information erasure
and the engine, we deﬁne the reversible heat generation hQirev and irreversible one hQiirr as

hQi
rev = (hQim − hQie)/2,
hQiirr = (hQim + hQie)/2.

In Fig. 6, hQirev and hQiirr were plotted against τ while ﬁxing the other parameter values
as ǫ = 10−4, ζ = 1 and k = 100. We found that hQirev and hQiirr are closed to kBT log 2
and 2ζ/τ , respectively. When the entropy production is deﬁned through the irreversible
heat generation, it becomes zero in the quasi-static limit. Do not confuse this fact with an
incorrect statement that the heat generation during information erasure can be zero [10],
because the generated heat during logically irreversible processes has a positive reversible
part.

Here we address three remarks on our results. First, for generality of our results, we
have studied another model where the single particle obeys the following equation instead
of Eq. (2),

5

where h ¯ξi = 0 and h ¯ξ(t)d ¯ξ(t′)i = 2¯ζkBT δ(t − t′). We conﬁrmed that this model yields a
qualitatively same graph as Fig. 5.

Second, with some purturbative calculations, we get an analytic expression of the work

done by the engine

where we have assumed that ǫ is small and k → ∞. Similarly, as to the heat generation in
the information erasure process,

These expressions are good agreement with the results of simulations where ǫ < 0.03.

Finally, we stress here the diﬀerence between our discussions and analysis recently pre-
sented by Magnasco [11]. His analysis is on the system described by a Fokker-Planck equation
and applies to the automatic engine which needs no observer. It was proposed by Popper
[12] as an objection to the notion that information is equivalent to negentropy (negative
entropy) [4]. While the engine needs no observer (hence no memory), Magnasco showed
that it cannot work as a perpetual cycle. His argument does not apply to the problem we
discuss, since our system is assumed to be manipulated by the external agent which makes
observation.

In conclusion, we invent a concrete model for Szilard’s engine. Numerical simulations
show that its energy transformation ability from the heat to mechanical work depends on
parameters, especially the mass ratio of the particle and the piston. We also ﬁnd that an
information erasure process need not cost kBT log 2 energy in the same model. As to the
Maxwell’s demon problem, the work obtained is not canceled with the generated heat in the
information discarding process.

The arising question out of our results is on the consistency with the second law. As
mentioned above, the interpretation of the Maxwell’s demon problem does not hold on the
assumptions we adopt, and hence the second law neither. As a plausible answer to the
question, we conjecture that the excess heat is generated in the measurement process which
transfers information from the engine to the memory. Even if a reversible measurement is
possible, it may be realized only for particular devices. (In our case, ǫ of the engine and
the memory are precisely the same value.) When the embodiment of the information in the
memory part is diﬀerent from that of the engine part, the excess heat may be necessary in
the information transferring process. These are future problems to be considered.

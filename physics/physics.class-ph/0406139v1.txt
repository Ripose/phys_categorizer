Abstract

In this paper we deal analytically with a version of the so called
clock paradox in which the moving clock performs a circular motion
of constant radius. The rest clock is denoted as (1), the rotating clock
is (2), the inertial frame in which (1) is at rest and (2) moves is I and,
ﬁnally, the accelerated frame in which (2) is at rest and (1) rotates is
A. By using the General Theory of Relativity in order to describe the
motion of (1) as seen in A we will show the following features. I) A
diﬀerential aging between (1) and (2) occurs at their reunion and it
has an absolute character, i.e. the proper time interval measured by
a given clock is the same both in I and in A. II) From a quantitative
point of view, the magnitude of the diﬀerential aging between (1) and
(2) does depend on the kind of rotational motion performed by A.
Indeed, if it is unif orm there is no any tangential force in the direction
of motion of (2) but only normal to it. In this case, the proper time
interval reckoned by (2) does depend only on its constant velocity v =
rω. On the contrary, if the rotational motion is unif ormly accelerated,
i.e. a constant force acts tangentially along the direction of motion,
the proper time intervals do depend on the angular acceleration α.
III) Finally, in regard to the sign of the aging, the moving clock (2)
measures always a shorter interval of proper time with respect to (1).

Introduction

moving clock

1.1 The impact of the acceleration on the proper time of a

What is the inﬂuence of the acceleration experienced by a moving particle
on the proper time τ reckoned by a clock at rest with respect to it? The
widely accepted answer is that τ is independent of any form of acceleration

1

because it depends explicitly only on the speed v of the accelerating particle
according to the well known formula

dτ = dt

in which c is the speed of light and t is the time measured by a standard
inertial clock. Eq.(1), which has been directly tested by observing the decay
rates of fast moving elementary particles in the cosmic rays [1], is assumed
to be valid also in in the case of an accelerated motion of the moving particle
according to the hypothesis of locality [2]. As an experimental support of the
independence of acceleration the experience with the circling muons in the
CERN storage ring [3] is often proposed. In it the muons are continuously
kept in a unif orm circular motion of constant radius r at an angular speed
ω under the action of a constant magnetic ﬁeld. Their observed decay
rates are in agreement with eq.(1), where v = ωr; since the muons are
continuously accelerated by the centripetal Lorentz force, this fact would
prove the independence of τ from the acceleration. Very often this experience
is adduced to present the independence of τ from any kind of acceleration
as if it was a general feature.

Incidentally, let us note that the circling muons scenario could also be
considered as a version of the clock paradox in which the moving clock,
denoted conventionally as (2), moves along a circular orbit [4] instead of
going to–and–fro in a straight line. The rest clock will be conventionally
denoted as (1)1.

1.2 Aim of the paper

In a recent paper [5] the ‘rectilinear’ version of the clock paradox has been
treated by accounting for the ﬁnite value of a constant force F which ac-
celerates and decelerates (2). In that case, in which a force acts along the
direction of motion of the travelling clock, it has been found that g = F/m,
where m is the mass of (2), does aﬀect the magnitude of the proper time in-
tervals ∆τ measured by the clocks at their reunion. However, this fact does
not alter the qualitative feature of the diﬀerential aging of the two clocks in
the sense that, also for g

= 0, ∆τ (2) < ∆τ (1).

In this paper we wish to investigate what happens to the proper time
intervals ∆τ if (2) reunites with (1) by performing a uniformly accelerated
1Its proper time would be, in this case, related to the measured time of ﬂight of the
ﬂying muons, while the proper time measured by (2) would be related to the lifetime of
the muons at rest.

circular motion, so that a tangential acceleration along the direction of its
motion is present as well:
indeed, we hypothesize that the result of the
circling muons at CERN could be due to the fact that, in that case, the
acceleration experienced by the particles is always normal to their motion.
Moreover, we will use the General Theory of Relativity in order to calculate
∆τ (1) and ∆τ (2) in the accelerated frame in which (2) is at rest. We will
investigate if, in this case, the diﬀerential aging between the two clocks can
be considered, as expected, absolute, i.e. ∆τ (2) < ∆τ (1) both from the point
of view of the inertial reference frame, denoted conventionally as I, in which
(1) is at rest and (2) moves, and from the point of view of the accelerated
frame, denoted as A, in which (2) is at rest and (1) is seen circling. Indeed,
the elapsed proper time is function only of the observer’s worldline and of
its starting/ending points:
it is the Lorentzian length of the segment of
worldline delimited by given endpoints. The spacetime of an accelerated
frame does not present a real curvature as if a true gravitational ﬁeld was
present. Whatever coordinates are used for ﬂat spacetime, it will always be
ﬂat. The coordinates used might change the form of the metric (even making
it nondiagonal), but they cannot create curvature. The choice of frame will
also change the coordinate expression of geodesics (e.g., the worldline of
clock (1)), but it will not change its geometrical properties, including its
proper-time length. Thus, the worldline will curve in the sense that its
spatial coordinates are not constant in the accelerated frame, but it will still
be straight in the sense that it is inertial (and therefore an extremum of
proper-time length).

Let us consider an inertial frame I in which the usual cartesian coordinates

and a clock, denoted as (1), is at rest. Another clock, denoted conventionally
as (2), moves nonuniformly along a circular path of constant radius r so to
encounter (1) on its trajectory: let us assume the center of the rotation of (2)
as the origin of I and ω = ω0+αT where α is a constant angular acceleration.
Let us consider a rotating frame in which (2) is at rest: it will be denoted
as A. According to Newtonian mechanics, if (2) has to be at rest in A both
centripetal and tangential forces must act on it. A real physical scenario
in which a particle moves around a circle of (nearly) constant radius and

3

its speed is continuously increased occurs, e.g., in the betatron. Indeed, in
it a spatially nonuniform, time-varying magnetic ﬁeld induces a rotational
electric ﬁeld along whose lines of force an elementary electrically charged
particle is kept in uniformly accelerated circular motion [6].

Let us denote ¯T

the time interval, measured by (1), during
which (2) describes an angular interval of 2π starting when T = 0. The
proper time interval measured by (2) is given by eq.(1). In this case

In order to simplify the calculations let us assume ω0 = 0, i.e. the clock (2)
starts its motion with zero angular velocity. It is interesting to note that a
certain condition on r must be fulﬁlled in order to prevent that the speed
attained by (2) overcomes the speed of light c before that a full revolution,
at least, is completed. Indeed, for ω = αT and φ = αT 2/2, where φ is the
azimuthal angle of (2), the orbital period of (2) measured by (1) is

4 Conclusions

In this paper we have analyzed a particular version of the so called clock
paradox in which the moving clock, denoted as (2), meets again the rest
clock, denoted as (1), by performing an uniformly accelerated circular motion
of constant radius. The inertial frame in which (1) is at rest is I while the
rotating accelerated frame in which (2) is at rest is A. In particular, we have
investigated if the presence of a tangential acceleration along the direction
of motion of (2) is responsible for a diﬀerential aging between the two clocks
at their reunion.

The obtained results can be summarized as follows

•

Both for ω =const and for ω linearly varying with time, ∆τI = ∆τA
for any given clock, as expected. So, the Special and General Theories
of Relativity do not lead to inconsistencies.

•

For ω =const the diﬀerential aging is given by the usual Special Rel-
ativistic formula, based on the hypothesis of locality, ∆τ (2)/∆τ (1) =

(v/c)2 < 1 with v = rω

−

•

•

q
The magnitude of the proper time intervals does depend on the angular
acceleration α for an uniformly accelerated circular motion. Moreover,
for ω linearly varying in time it turns out that ∆τ (2) < ∆τ (1).

The diﬀerential aging does depend on α, i.e. ∆τ (2)/∆τ (1) = f (α),
contrary to the case in which an accelerated rectilinear motion is con-
sidered in which ∆τ (2)/∆τ (1) depends only on the velocity reached
when the force is inverted.

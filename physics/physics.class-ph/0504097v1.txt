(Received 21 January 2014)

Wave-mean ﬂow equations for mass and momentum conservation in three dimensions,
previously obtained with a vertical coordinate transform, are generalized here to ran-
dom waves, and re-derived from the Generalized Lagrangian Mean equations. Combining
the momentum equation with a three-dimensional equation for wave pseudo-momentum
yields a set of equations describing the interactions of waves, mean ﬂow and turbulence.
Consistent boundary conditions and parameterizations are described. These include a
Generalized Lagrangian Mean equation for the turbulent kinetic energy that describes
the stretching of turbulence by the shear of the wave-induced Stokes drift. The equations
derived here are readily integrated by coupling a spectral wave model to an ocean circu-
lation model, with practical applications to the forecasting of surface drift, upper ocean
mixing, coastal ocean circulation, and wave forecasting.

1. Introduction

The inﬂuence of waves on the mean ﬂow has been well recognized in speciﬁc situations,
and forms the basis of models of the nearshore circulation, in and around the surf zone.
In the deep ocean the role of surface waves in shaping the ocean mixed layer through air-
sea ﬂuxes and mixing is now well established, but ocean circulation models are still not
accounting for these important eﬀects. Putting current theories into practice requires
a consistent, accurate, and easy-to-use formalism for coupling waves, mean ﬂow and
turbulence. The present paper proposes such a formalism, based on ﬁrst principles and
amenable to further extensions.

Although depth-integrated equations are well established (Phillips 1977) and have been
extended to account for internal waves (Kudryavtsev 1994) and rotation of the Earth (e.g.
Ardhuin, Chapron & Elfouhaily 2004), the basic three-dimensional (3D) equations with
phase-averaged wave eﬀects are not yet well established for general situations. Several
sets of 3D equations have been proposed to describe the interactions of waves with the
mean ﬂow, with potential applications to oceanographic problems. In particular the pop-
ular Craik-Leibovich equations (Craik & Leibovich 1976) were successfully applied to
the formation of Langmuir circulations (LCs), as demonstrated by Large Eddy Simula-
tions (LES, e.g. McWilliams, Sullivan & Moeng 1997). Nevertheless these equations were
derived for a uniform wave ﬁeld (Leibovich 1980, Holm 1996) which is a priori incompat-
ible with the existence of the vortex force that is responsible for driving LCs. Although

2

wave ﬁeld gradients may be weak on the scale of LCs, momentum conservation is sat-
isﬁed only when refraction of waves over LCs modiﬁes the waves pseudo-momentum.
This refraction compensates for the change of mean ﬂow momentum represented by the
vortex force (Garrett 1976). This eﬀect may be termed ‘local recoil’ by analogy with
the similar remote recoil described by B¨uhler & McIntyre (2003). The Craik-Leibovich
equations are therefore inapplicable to regions of strong gradients such as the surf zone,
and attempts at a parameterization of wave breaking and the induced enhancement of
turbulence have been only schematic (Noh, Min & Raasch 2004). Recently McWilliams
et al. (2004) proposed a new formalism separating waves, long (infragravity) waves, and
the mean ﬂow, based on expansions in the wave slope in cartesian coordinates, including
eﬀects of gradients in the wave ﬁeld, but equations do not yet include turbulence in a
realistic way.

One essential diﬃculty for obtaining a realistic description of the ocean are the large
gradients at the air-sea interface. These strong variations impose that 3D models use
either very high resolution and interface tracking schemes, that will not be considered
here, or surface-following coordinates. The simplest coordinate transform was proposed
recently by Mellor (2003), with a transformation of the vertical coordinate only. Mellor’s
equations are not so easy to use because they give a rate of change of the Lagrangian-mean
velocity although the Eulerian-mean is also needed to evaluate boundary conditions and
turbulent ﬂuxes. Besides, the original formulation of Mellor’s equations and the general
use of Craik-Leibovich equations is for monochromatic waves that cannot represent both
the scale of the Stokes layer and the full production of Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE)
associated with wave-induced shear. Finally, a very high resolution would be required in
order to resolve this shear at the surface.

Another type of coordinate transform gives the Generalized Lagrangian Mean (GLM)
equations of Andrews & McIntyre (1978a). Averages in GLM follow the mean displace-
ment of particles, so that each mean quantity can be expressed as an Eulerian mean plus
a Stokes correction. GLM is exact even for non-linear and rotational waves and has been
applied to wave-current interactions using approximations in the form of low-order series
expansions in the wave slope (e.g. Groeneweg 1999, Groeneweg & Battjes 2003). GLM
was also used to derive the Craik-Leibovich equations (Leibovich 1980). However, the
original GLM is not so easy to use because GLM-transformed equations involve a mean
vertical displacement that is second-order in the wave slope (McIntyre 1988).

Further complications arise with the separation of the ﬂow into ‘mean ﬂow’, ‘waves’
and ‘turbulence’. Although some patterns will be clearly understood as waves or mean
ﬂow, it may be advantageous to describe structures such as LCs as a mean ﬂow over
which waves refract, typically in LES models, or as turbulence stretched by the Stokes
drift, in large scale oceanic models. The separation of waves from the rest of the ﬂow is
itself problematic. A long tradition has used the property that waves are mostly irrota-
tional. Yet, in the interaction of waves with turbulence Phillips (1958) demonstrated that
wave motions have a signiﬁcant vorticity, which was recently conﬁrmed by Magnaudet &
Masbernat (1990, see also also Thais & Magnaudet 1996). Wave vorticity also appears
as a result of the Coriolis force (e.g. Backus 1962, Hasselmann 1970, Pollard 1970, Xu &
Bowen 1994). Although we shall not consider vorticity in the wave motion except for the
eﬀect of the Coriolis force and the bottom boundary layer, we present here a formalism
that is designed to be easily extended to include wave vorticity in the upper ocean. We
thus deﬁne turbulence by the diﬀerence between the full ﬁelds and averages of those ﬁelds
over ﬂow realizations with ﬁxed wave phases. This allows for a modulation of turbulent
properties over a wave period, which could be considered part of the wave motion if
we had chosen a diﬀerent deﬁnition. Wave eﬀects on the mean ﬂow are obtained with

Practical 3D formalism for waves, currents and turbulence

a further GLM average, which is an average on the wave phases, and can be computed
from a wave spectrum. Another simple solution, not detailed here, is to deﬁne the GLM
as a low-pass time average, allowing a variation of wave properties on the scale of wave
groups as done by Reniers & al (2004). That would be a narrow spectrum approximation
with amplitude modulations.

In order to obtain a practical and consistent set of equations we thus generalize Mel-
lor’s equations for random waves in § 2, with consistent boundary conditions and mixing
parameterizations, and give a more general derivation of these equations from the GLM
formalism, giving GLM-Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes Equations at second order in
wave slope, later referred to as GLM2-RANS. A GLM2 equation for the Turbulent Ki-
netic Energy is derived in § 3, with a description of its possible use for turbulent closure
of the GLM2-RANS equations. Using a 3D equation for the wave pseudo-momentum we
obtain a corresponding Mellor-type equation for the Eulerian mean momentum in § 4.
Processes related to wave evolution are discussed in § 5, and conclusions in § 6.

Notations used below are, as much as possible, consistent with both Mellor (2003) and
Andrews & McIntyre (1978a), with additions from Ardhuin & Herbers (2002) for spectral
wave aspects.

2. 3D equations for the mean ﬂow

2.1. Sigma-coordinate transform for random waves

Practical applications require the treatment of random waves, and common sense rec-
ommends the use of already-existing wave models, even if they need to be improved. An
outline of how this can be done was given by Jenkins (1989), who coupled a one-vertical-
dimension hydrodynamic model with a single-point version of the WAM spectral wave
model (WAMDI 1988). Mellor’s (2003) equations were derived by deﬁning implicitly the
vertical coordinate ς (ζ in his notation), so that the Cartesian vertical coordinate z is

z = s (x, ς, t) =

η + ςD +

with x the Cartesian horizontal position vector,

a wave contribution so that s (ς = 0) = η, the actual position of the sea surface, including
wave motions, and, below the surface,

particles due to the wave motion.

A natural generalization of Mellor’s (2003) equations to random waves is to let

s be
the sum of the contributions of each wave train, as illustrated by ﬁgure 1. In doing
this we still impose that s(ς = 0) = η at the surface, and that
s be the wave-induced
vertical displacement in the water column. However, it is impossible to write down an
exact expression for surface elevation because of the non-linearities and the presence of
bound-wave terms.

or, more formally, by a Fourier-Stieltjes transform extended to evolutionary spectra
(Priestley 1981). The equation for the evolution of E (k) can be obtained by consid-
ering, as in § 3.2 (see also Ardhuin & Herbers 2002), the higher order terms in ε1 and
ε2 given by wind forcing, wave dissipation near the surface, bottom friction and wave
scattering processes.

2.2. 3D momentum and mass equations
The basic momentum equation was derived for monochromatic waves by Mellor (2003,
equation 50). Although the eﬀect of air pressure-surface slope correlations was not prop-
erly justiﬁed (see Appendix A), the ﬁnal form of Mellor’s equation 50 is correct. Because
Mellor’s equations are accurate to second order in ε1 and ﬁrst order in ε2 the eﬀect of
random waves is the linear sum of the eﬀects of each spectral component (see e.g. Kenyon
1969). These equations can alternatively be derived from Andrews and McIntyre’s (1978a)
Generalized Lagrangian Mean formalism (see Appendix B), using the spectral extension
outlined above, giving,

2.3. Surface boundary conditions

Assuming that the air-sea ﬂuxes are known, we impose the continuity of velocity and
the normal and shear stresses Pnn and Pns across the air-sea interface, and velocity only
on the bottom. Assuming small Froude numbers for turbulent motions, turbulence is
blocked by the surface so that the surface position and vertical velocity are equal to their
Reynolds averages. Thus continuity of velocity across the interface reads,

The second order expansion of the local shear stress Pns was derived by Xu & Bowen
(1994, equations 25 and 35), with a small error in the expression of the second order
expression for n (they omitted the second order Stokes surface elevation), but that will
not aﬀect our results here since this omitted term has a zero mean. We only need the
normal stress Pnn to ﬁrst order because the air pressure correlated with the surface slope
is a ﬁrst order quantity (see Appendix A), that is,

atmosphere to the wave ﬁeld. Neglecting variations of the shear stress over the phase of
the waves (Jenkins 1992) τ in is only due to correlations of the surface air pressure with
the surface slope (see Appendix A). The second term is the viscous stress applied to
the Eulerian velocity that is transferred beyond the surface viscous layer as a turbulent
ﬂux, and the last term τvw is usually called the ‘virtual wave stress’ (e.g. Xu & Bowen
1994) and may be a signiﬁcant fraction of surface viscous stress as measured by Banner
& Peirson (1998).

The wave-supported stress τ in can be extended in the water column as the correla-
tion of wave-induced pressure and streamline slope. In (x, y, ς) coordinates this is easily
interpreted as a pseudo-shear stress, supported by the wave ﬁeld, so that, the vertical
divergence of this ﬂux,

1
D

∂τ in
∂ς

= Tin

(2.19)

is the force that contributes to the growth of wave pseudo-momentum at depth z = ςD,
with a vertical proﬁle identical to that of the Stokes drift.

In the same way, τvw can be generalized to all elevations on either side of the interface
as τvw = ρν (∂Usα/∂ς) /D . The vertical divergence of τvw is thus the momentum source
for the mean ﬂow associated to the viscous dissipation of wave energy into heat (see
Phillips 1977 and the Appendix in Xu & Bowen 1994). A small fraction (ρaνa) / (ρwνw)
of the water-side wave pseudo momentum is transferred to the atmosphere, but most
of the momentum is given up in the water very near the surface because ∂τvw/∂ς is
proportional to the seventh moment of the frequency spectrum which is determined by
capillary waves with wavelengths of a few centimetres (Phillips 1977).

We can thus express (2.18) at the base of the surface viscous layer, ς = −δs, away
from the large shear in the Eulerian velocity (conﬁned to the top millimetre, see McLeish
& Putland 1975, Peirson & Banner 1998), in an area where Eulerian velocity gradients
should be resolved by a numerical model,

2.4. Bottom boundary conditions

All wave eﬀects were derived so far using linear wave theory with a free-slip condition
on the bottom. This is essentially valid at a distance of a few δb from the actual water-
sediment interface, with the wave boundary layer thickness δb ≈ u⋆w/σ where u⋆w is the
friction velocity in the wave boundary layer. δ is generally less than 10 cm. A proper
representation of the wave boundary layer therefore does not aﬀect previous results, and
we may therefore adopt a state of the art representation of bottom friction including
eﬀects of moveable bed roughness (e.g. Trowbridge & Madsen 1984a, Madsen & al. 1990)
and near bed mass transport (known as ‘streaming’, see e.g. Trowbridge & Madsen 1984b,
Marin 2004). As ocean circulation models typically do not resolve the WBBL, we may
represent the loss of wave energy and momentum in the WBBL as a modiﬁcation of the
bottom boundary condition that apply at the top of the WBBL, with a parameterized
stress and non-zero Eulerian and Stokes drift velocities.

We thus have

with u⋆c the friction velocity for the Eulerian current, τ bfric the wave pseudo-momentum

due to pressure-slope correlations over bedforms, and can be signiﬁcant for energetic
waves (Ardhuin et al. 2003). In laminar ﬂow conditions the viscous dissipation of wave
energy may be the dominant contribution and should be included in τ bfric. Equations
(2.21)-(2.22) can be solved iteratively for the unknowns z0a′ and u⋆c.

3. Mixing

The last term of (2.9), (X

mentum plus wave pseudo-momentum). Since momentum is conserved and turbulence
has zero momentum, this term can only represent a spatial redistribution of mean ﬂow
momentum or wave pseudo-momentum. For the mean ﬂow momentum this mixing will
be parameterized with an eddy viscosity Kz. Mass-ﬂux schemes, as used for atmospheric
convection, will not be considered even though they may perform better when the mixed
layer is well resolved (Cheinet 2002).

We represent mixing as the sum of vertical mixing and horizontal mixing,

Various parameterizations have been proposed for the horizontal mixing tensor Rh
αβ
(e.g. Smagorinsky 1965) and these will not be discussed here, we only note that they are
highly resolution-dependent, with speciﬁc parameterizations proposed for the surf zone
(e.g. Svendsen & Putrevu 1994). We further expect that high-resolution simulations may
need to incorporate the diﬀusion eﬀects of Langmuir circulations and waves, that could
be veriﬁed by existing observations.

We rather insist on the parameterization of Kz. If the popular KPP scheme is used,
one should be careful to modify the original proﬁle of Kz (Large, McWilliams & Doney
1994, see also J´ez´equel, Pichon & Maz´e 2004) so that Kz goes to realistically large values
at the surface. This can be done by modifying the polynomial expression of the proﬁle
function G, that should go to z0w at the surface, with the waterside roughness length z0w
determined by the wave ﬁeld (see e.g. Mellor & Blumberg 2004 for a parameterization of
z0w).

Another option is to use a so-called Mellor-Yamada scheme (Mellor & Yamada 1982,
Mellor & Blumberg 2004) or any other scheme that is based on at least one equation
for the Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE). Such a description of TKE evolution will be
explored here because it gives insight into the coupling of waves, mean ﬂow and turbu-
lence.

This last equation implies that the Reynolds stresses that interact with one wave compo-

This is clearly not applicable to the WBBL. Near the surface, ﬂuctuations of turbulence
with the wave phase were observed by Thais & Magnaudet (1996) but they should only
give higher order corrections to Ps.

Ardhuin & Jenkins (On the interaction of waves and upper ocean turbulence, manuscript

uniform and carries all the air-sea momentum ﬂux,

− ρwu′

αw′ = τα,

(3.8)

10

because most of the air-sea ﬂux is carried by short waves that lose their energy to
turbulence very close to the surface (relative to the wavelength of longer waves). They
obtained

Using (3.4) one gets Pws, the conversion of wave energy to TKE,

This production can be either positive, if waves propagate in the direction of the turbulent
stress, or negative in the other case. The vertical proﬁle of Pws is identical to the Stokes
drift shear, and is thus concentrated near the surface.

In order to compute Pws due to all wave components, the assumed turbulent ﬂux in
αw′/τaα, as the turbulent ﬂux is dwarfed by the
(3.8) should be corrected by the ratio u′
wave-supported ﬂux near the surface, and dominates below the depth at which waves
have transferred most of their momentum to the mean ﬂow. Assuming that the total ﬂux
is the turbulent ﬂux plus the wave-supported ﬂux due to wave generation by the wind,
that ratio can be estimated by using the spectral shape of the wind input source term,

αw′/τaα = 1 −

Because Usα (ς = 0) is proportional to the third moment of the frequency spectrum of
the surface elevation variance (the ‘wave spectrum’), it is sensitive to that variance at
high frequencies. The order of magnitude of Pws ≈ τaαUsα (ς = 0) /ρw may be obtained
by using a properly deﬁned wave spectrum that matches observations of wave energy
(the zeroth moment) and mean square surface slope (the fourth moment), as a function
of wind speed and fetch, such as proposed by Kudryavtsev et al. (1999). This gives
Us (ς = 0) = 0.012U10 for unlimited fetch, U10 being the wind speed at 10 m height. In
comparison, the momentum ﬂux generally associated with wave breaking is expected to
be one order of magnitude larger for active wind-wave generation, Pwb = AτaαU10/ρw
with A of the order of 0.1–0.2 (e.g. Craig & Banner 1994, Mellor & Blumberg 2004).

3.3. TKE production in the WBBL

In the WBBL where the turbulent ﬂux is actually due to the wave shear, one may use
(3.1) and a parameterization of the form,

where Nijlm is a viscosity tensor, giving

Such a parameterization, including the time-variation of N , is given by Davies & Vil-
laret (1999, see also Marin 2004). However, the determination of the roughness length
for the wave orbital motion poses another problem that can be avoid by with a direct
parameterization of the wave dissipation (e.g. Ardhuin et al. 2003 for parameterization
over sand-dominated sediments with weak currents).

Similar arguments can be developed for the ‘inner layer’ layer at the ocean surface (see

(3.12)

(3.13)

Practical 3D formalism for waves, currents and turbulence

11

e.g. Makin & Kudryavtsev 1999 for a description of the atmospheric inner layer), but we
will neglect this eﬀect on the ground that this layer is very thin.

4. A practical 3D momentum equation

In order to estimate shear stresses, the Eulerian velocity must be estimated. Besides,
practical applications may not be able to aﬀord the necessary vertical resolution to resolve
the vertical shear of the Lagrangian Mean velocity near the surface. We therefore seek an
equation in ς coordinates, similar the ﬁrst form of the GLM equations of Andrews and
McIntyre (1978a), for their variable uL − p which corresponds to our
u. Such an equation
could possibly be derived directly from that GLM equation following the method used
in Appendix B. However, now that it has been properly derived, we shall use (2.9).

Splitting the momentum in the ﬁrst rate of change term of (2.9), into an Eulerian
velocity plus a wave pseudo-momentum that is then moved to the right hand side, one
gets,

(4.1)

A na¨ıve implementation of (4.1) in a numerical model would consist of estimating ∂ust/∂t
by applying a Stokes drift proﬁle to the increments of the wave energy E over one
time step. This approach may lead to errors as the gains or losses of wave pseudo-
momentum ∂Us/∂t may have vertical proﬁles quite diﬀerent from the wave pseudo-
momentum p = Us. In particular, it must be kept in mind that the waves support a
signiﬁcant fraction of the momentum ﬂux at the surface and bottom boundaries. We have
seen in § 2.3 that momentum lost due to viscous dissipation of the waves is partially given
to the atmosphere and bottom sediments. It can thus be wrong to make waves exchange
momentum with the water column only, as done by Dolata & Rosenthal (1984). They
considered the case of waves attenuated by bottom friction (which can be signiﬁcant,
see e.g. Ardhuin & al. 2003), and assumed that the momentum source for the mean ﬂow
had the vertical proﬁle of the Stokes drift. However, it is not clear why dissipation in the
wave bottom boundary layer would lead to a production of mean ﬂow momentum over
the entire water column.

Waves redistribute their pseudo-momentum over the vertical due to the fact that they
propagate in a waveguide that imposes the vertical proﬁles of p for free waves. The
associated vertical ﬂuxes of p are unknown, so that the only practical solution at hand
is to evaluate the vertical proﬁles of momentum exchanges between waves and the mean
ﬂow, i.e. we need a 3D equation for p.

4.1. 3D wave pseudo-momentum

(4.6)

These are source terms for the wind input, wave-wave interactions, wave dissipation, bot-
tom friction, wave-bottom scattering, and wave guide eﬀects, respectively. Twg integrates
vertically to zero, just like the term for wave-wave interactions Tnl.

We can further split Tds into eﬀect of whitecapping, viscous dissipation, and wave-
turbulence interaction (outside of the wave bottom boundary layer represented in Tbfric),
α + T turb
Since the vertical distribution of wave guide eﬀects represented by Twg are completely
unknown and will not be explored here, the present eﬀort of establishing a 3D equation
for the wave pseudo-momentum may look pointless. The following two assumptions are
now necessary, they will hopefully be veriﬁed by observations:

α + T visc
α .

α = T wc
T ds

(4.7)

When waves and turbulence are present, the conversion of wave energy to TKE for
each spectral component corresponds to a conversion of wave pseudo-momentum to mean
ﬂow momentum, with the same vertical proﬁle. Further, wave-wave interactions and wave
guide eﬀects does not directly contribute to exchanges with the mean ﬂow.

Practical 3D formalism for waves, currents and turbulence

13

The ﬁrst hypothesis is clearly diﬀerent from that of Dolata & Rosenthal (1984), who
took a Stokes drift proﬁle for the source of mean ﬂow momentum. In particular the
present assumption will yield a stronger enhancement of bottom streaming in the case of
bottom friction, and weaker acceleration of the ﬂow in the entire water column. Such a
choice is even more important for the loss of wave pseudomomentum due to whitecapping
that is generally much stronger and expected to be concentrated near the surface (e.g.
Melville et al. 2002). We now brieﬂy describe the parameterizations to be used for each
source term.

wind input: as shown by Mellor (2003, see also Appendix A) the momentum source

due to wave generation by the wind is given by

Tin =

ρwg
D

v

2kD

cosh [2kD(1 + ς)]
sinh(2KD)

(4.8)

with Sin the energy source term as used in a numerical wave model. Among the existing
parameterization for Sin the one by Janssen (1989, with extensions described in Komen
& al. 1994) seems to give good results. It is based on quasi-linear theory and adjusted
to observations. However it does not take into account the presence of swell that may
slightly modify the wind input. It can also be reﬁned by using the sum of linear and
quadratic functions of u⋆ (e.g. Banner & Young 1994) in order to better represent wind
input observations for both long (Snyder et al. 1981, Hasselmann & B¨osenberg 1991) and
short waves (Plant 1982). The quadratic term may also be reduced at very high frequency
to account for the sheltering of short waves by long waves (Hara & Belcher 2002).

wave-wave interactions: we may assume that

Tnl =

ρwg
D

Z

2kD

cosh [2kD(1 + ς)]
sinh(2KD)

kSnl/σdk,

(4.9)

with Snl given by Herterich & Hasselmann (1980), possibly simpliﬁed as, for example,
the Discrete Interaction Approximation (Hasselmann & Hasselmann 1985). Although we
know that Tnl integrates to zero over the vertical, there is no theory for the vertical re-
distribution of wave pseudo-momentum due to wave-wave interactions that could justify
the proﬁle assumed here.

bottom friction: A quantitatively good approximation of the decay of wave energy
over a sandy bottom without signiﬁcant currents can be obtained by taking into account
the formation of sand ripples (see Ardhuin et al. 2003 for details of the parameterization
and a validation). Further reﬁnements for the eﬀects of currents on waves can be found
in Myrhaug et al. (2001). Muddy and rocky areas need special treatment.

wave-bottom scattering: wave reﬂection over the bottom topography results in an
exchange of momentum between waves and the bottom due to correlations of pressure
and bottom slope on the scale of the wavelength. We may thus include this source term
in the bottom boundary layer, writing

Tbscat = δ(ς,−1)

Sbscatdk.

Partial reﬂections over localized abrupt features in the bottom topography can also be
represented by this source term, as long as they have small amplitudes relative to the
water depth (Magne et al. 2004).

water viscosity: Since the local loss of wave pseudo-momentum is concentrated within
a few centimetres of the air-sea interface (see § 2.3), the source term can be regarded as

(4.11)

We include the contribution of viscous stresses in the highly sheared WBBL into the
bottom friction term.

wave-turbulence interactions outside the WBBL: As wave energy is converted
to TKE according to (3.10) and (3.11), momentum is exchanges with the mean ﬂow. We
will assume that this momentum exchange Tturb has the same proﬁle as Pws.

whitecapping: There are many debates on the spectral distribution of wave en-
ergy losses due to whitecapping. In particular, wave models that do not separate wave-
turbulence interaction from whitecapping have used a rather broad distribution of wave
dissipation over the entire spectrum (see Komen et al. 1994). We will here take the view
that wave energy is lost essentially in the saturated part of the wave spectrum and is
well predicted by a saturation threshold, as described by Alves & Banner (2003). We
now need to describe at what depth the wave momentum is given up to the mean ﬂow,
with a vertical proﬁle that should be given by a detailed description of a breaking waves.
Although some measurements of the detailed ﬂow below breaking waves have now been
made (Melville et al. 2002), it is still fairly arbitrary to decide at what depth the mo-
mentum and turbulence are injected by breakers before further diﬀusion with turbulent
mixing. We have at most an upper value for this depth for a given breaker size and type,
that may be used with a distribution (e.g. Phillips 1985, Melville & Matusov 2002) of
self-similar breakers (e.g. Reul & Chapron 2003). This matter is further discussed in § 5.

Finally the mixing parameterization should include the production of TKE by the

Stokes shear, as proposed in § 3 for example.

5. Discussion

Results and performances of the model outlined here will be investigated elsewhere
because they may vary with choices in parameterization (A coherent wave-current-
turbulence parameterization of upper ocean processes, by Rascle, Ardhuin & March-
esiello, manuscript in preparation for the Journal of Physical Oceanography). However,
it is important to discuss the impact of a few parameterization choices.

5.1. Wave breaking

It is obvious from observations that the upper ocean is highly mixed relative to the
boundary layer below a rigid boundary (e. g. Agrawal et al. 1992, Terray et al. 2000),
and the high level of turbulence very near the surface is apparently due to wave breaking.
In a numerical model that does not intend to resolve breaking events, one may probably
obtain good proﬁles of TKE and velocities either with a strong injection of TKE below
the surface, and relatively little mixing, or with a strong injection of TKE at the surface
and a more vigorous mixing.

Some applications may require a detailed description of this process that has been
done with the parameterization of coherent motions (rollers) acting as a momentum or
energy buﬀers between the wave ﬁeld and the mean ﬂow or turbulence. This may be
justiﬁed by the diﬀerence density the aerated ﬂuid that is called roller in applications
to the nearshore circulation (e.g. Govender et al. 2002). This roller is not too diﬀerent
from the entraining plume of Longuet-Higgins & Turner (1974), that takes its momentum
from the breaking wave and gives momentum to the underlying ﬂuid by a horizontal drag
force at the plume interface.

5.2. Long (infragravity) waves
Although wave eﬀects were explicitly formulated from a wave spectrum, the spectrum
may alternatively be replaced by energy modulated in time on the scale of wave groups
with slowly varying carrier frequency and wave direction, with a corresponding modula-
tion of all second-order wave quantities (Stokes drift, action ...). This latter option allows
the time and space resolution of infragravity (IG) motions as part of the ‘mean ﬂow’.
These motions are most important in the nearshore, in particular when sediment trans-
port is considered (e.g. Reniers et al. 2004). IG motions may also be relevant to future
ocean altimetry missions or other applications. Obtaining IG bound wave properties in
the spectral formulation as given in present paper would require using higher order spec-
tral statistics (e.g. Herbers & Burton 1997). Using either one of these options avoids the
more complex separation in waves, IG waves and mean ﬂow performed by McWilliams
et al. (2004).

6. Conclusions

We have derived a consistent set of equations and boundary conditions that generalizes
Mellor’s (2003) equations to spectral waves. Because this derivation uses the Generalized
Lagrangian Mean of Andrews & McIntyre (1978), it is amenable to further extensions,
including the interaction of surface and internal waves, that will be added in future
work, or the inclusion of nonlinear eﬀects that might appear at higher order in the wave
slope. The present formalism, once the proper parameterizations are fully deﬁned, should

Practical 3D formalism for waves, currents and turbulence

17

be applicable for describing nearshore ﬂows, surface wave evolution and upper ocean
processes. Results obtained by Mellor & Blumberg (2004) and Lewis & Belcher (2003),
already validate parts of the present formalism, i.e. the parameterization of enhanced
turbulence near the surface and its impact on the surface temperature cycle, and the
eﬀects of the Hasselmann force (the combined eﬀect of Coriolis and Stokes drift) on the
velocity proﬁle below the depth of enhanced turbulence, respectively. A general validation
of the full model will be presented later, including surface drift velocities.

Open discussions with George Mellor, Bertrand Chapron, Tanos Elfouhaily and Stephen

Henderson contributed signiﬁcantly to the advancement of the present work.

Appendix A. Eﬀects of surface pressure ﬂuctuations

A.1. Wind-wave growth

Waves are generated by pressure and tangential stress variations on the scale of the
wavelength. We solve here the problem with the usual cartesian coordinate system before
transforming the solution to sigma coordinates. The variation of tangential stresses is
neglected (see Lamb 1932 p. 629, Jenkins 1992). Atmospheric pressure at the surface can
be described as,

pa (x, t) =

pa (x, t) +

k,σp the Fourier component of the air pressure at the surface, with wavenumber

diﬀerential equations, the wave ﬁeld can now be obtained by adding the general solution
in absence of forcing and a particular solution of the wave equations that satisﬁes this
forcing. Neglecting terms that are second order in ε1, the surface equation for the wave
potential φ is

so that the pressure response under the water is not entirely in phase with the pressure
forcing, which was mistakenly suggested by Mellor (2003). Although it is an apparent
paradox that the wave pressure pp at the surface is not equal to the atmospheric pressure,
the diﬀerence is explained by the partial adjustment of the surface elevation and the
resulting hydrostatic pressure: Again, pp is the non-hydrostatic pressure only.

To obtain the surface elevation amplitudes Z p

Atmospheric pressure is generally inﬂuenced by the waves, say, to ﬁrst order, propor-

tional with a complex coeﬃcient βC = (−βR − iβI ) to the elevation,

k,σp = δ (σp, s1σ) ρgβC Z s1
P a
where δ(x, y) equals 0 unless x = y, and with βI positive for growing waves, and βR
positive also due to the Bernoulli equation in the air: for winds faster than the waves,
the ﬂow accelerates over the wave crests due to streamline convergence, and thus the
pressure decreases.

(A 10)

k

Thus the wave energy will be augmented at ﬁrst order in βI by the following term, Ep,
Ep(k) = tσβI E2(k)

(A 11)

This equation is only valid for short time scales since we have assumed a constant
spectrum, it is thus better written as a time derivative (over long times), following the
method of Hasselman (1962),

∂E(k)
∂t

= σβI E2(k) = Sin(k)

(A 12)

A.2. Bound waves and momentum equation
We have thus computed waves that are induced by air pressure ﬂuctuations. These waves
are characterized by ηp, pp, φp. They have a free wave structure propagating at the
speed of the air pressure perturbation: the polarization relations between all variables
are identical to those of free waves, except for one extra term in the pressure and elevation
represented by the second terms in (A 8) and (A 9), respectively.

The bound wave terms (ppb, ηpb) can be written as

(A 15)

The βI component of the pressure ﬂuctuations, in quadrature with the free wave elevation,
clearly drives bound waves with a surface elevation in quadrature ahead of the free waves.
The βR component of the pressure ﬂuctuations, in anti-phase with the elevation, tends
to increase the wave height since the resulting surface elevation is in phase with the free
waves.

It is striking that this ‘bound wave’ has no corresponding velocity and a pressure op-
posite to the corresponding pressure if it were a free wave. Indeed the associated velocity
is part of the rate of change of the free wave velocity. It should be noted that integration
of the vertical velocity does yield the vertical displacements of the bound wave. In terms
of the coordinate transform (2.1), keeping s(ς = 0) = η requires a modiﬁcation of s due
to the bound wave. In order to change s we can add to it a term of amplitude Spb,s1
,
with a vertical proﬁle given by bound terms in the vertical displacement, that happen to
have the same vertical proﬁle as the free waves,

(A 16)

This part of the change of variable s induces extra terms in the equations of motion,
wpb, which now has a component in quadrature with the
including a vertical velocity
velocity and pressure. Considering only the solution driven by the pressure component
in quadrature with the elevation, and evaluating all modiﬁed terms in the equations of
motion, one gets exactly the same term as in Mellor’s (2003) equation (51a), that is,

Appendix B. Transformation of the GLM equation to

sigma-coordinates

For simplicity equations are derived considering a single wave train of wavenumber
vector k and intrinsic frequency σ. Results from random waves are obtained by replacing
the surface elevation variance varη by the spectral energy density. All second order quan-
tities are simply the sums of the following monochromatic solution for all wavenumber

20

vectors. Another option is to use a narrow spectrum approximation and resolve explicitly
the variations in wave properties over the scale of wave groups.

We shall apply results obtained by Andrews and McIntyre (1978a, 1978b), replacing
their equations (3.2) and (4.1) by Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes equations (RANS),
which means that their dissipative forces X represent both viscous forces and turbulent
Reynolds stresses. We shall retain all wave eﬀects up to second order in the wave slope and
ﬁrst order in the wave. The resulting equations are therefore second order Generalized
Lagrangian Mean RANS equation, abbreviated as GLM2-RANS.

B.1. Mass conservation

The Jacobian J of the GLM coordinate transformation (from Eulerian coordinates) can
be shown to be equal to 1 plus a second order quantity. Using the 3D wave action A (see
Andrews and McIntyre 1978b), one has,

J = 1 + J2 + O(ε3
1)
k2A
σ

J2 = −

= −k2varη

cosh [2k(z + h)]

,

where varη is the surface elevation variance due to the waves. Because there is no mean
stretching of the horizontal coordinates, a vertical distance dz′ = Jdz in GLM cor-
responds to a Cartesian distance dz. As J < 1 over the entire water column on has
dz′ > dz. Thus the vertical GLM position is everywhere larger than the mean Eulerian
elevation of the same water particles. In a sense this is because at any time there are
more particles per horizontal length of crest than of trough (McIntyre 1988).

Integrating over depth we deﬁne

sG(x, z, t) = −

J2(z′)dz′ = kvarη

where the Kij are the cofactors of the coordinate transform matrix x → (x + ξ), and
Bαj is the ﬂux in direction j of a generalized wave action in direction opposite to xα
(Andrews and McIntyre 1978b, equation 2.7b, see also Jenkins & Ardhuin 2004),

To second order we thus have

Bαj = p′ξj,α + pξmξj,α.

Rα3 = p′ξ3,1 + ρgξ3,1ξ3,α = plξ3,1

It should be noted that this term does not integrate to zero over the vertical as pointed
out by Andrews and McIntyre (1978b, see corrigendum). We can now consider the con-
tribution of bound waves due to air pressure ﬂuctuations over the waves, as considered

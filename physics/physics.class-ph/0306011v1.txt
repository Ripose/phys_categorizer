A novel coupler formed by left-handed material (LHM) is considered. Using the supermode theory,
we analyze the coupling system for two single-mode waveguides and study the coupling lengths versus
the width of the negative refractive index layer (d2). To avoid the loss at the interface, a LHM layer
with two sharp ends is inserted into the coupling system. From our results, we know that the coupling
length decreases dramatically when d2 increases. For a speciﬁc wavelength (communication window)
λ = 1.55µm, the coupling length changes from 3.2 × 107µm (d2 = 0) to 524µm (d2 = 7λ).

Recently, a new type of electromagnetic materials
called left-handed media (LHM), which have simultane-
ously a negative electric permittivity and a negative mag-
netic permeability, has generated a great interest[1, 2, 3,
4]. In 1968, Veselago theoretically investigated this kind
of material and predicted some of extraordinary proper-
ties, such as the negative refraction, Doppler shift and
Cerenkov radiation, etc[5]. But because of the unavail-
ability of LHMs at that time, his idea did not attract
much interest until very recently, following the sugges-
tion of Pendry et al.[6], D. R. Smith et al. proposed
a system consisting an array of resonators and metallic
wires and demonstrated experimentally the phenomenon
for negative refraction in a narrow microwave frequency
region[7]. This discovery aroused great interest in the
unusual electrodynamic properties of left-handed mate-
rials. Pendry predicted that a LHM slab can behave like
a perfect lens since the LHM slab can amplify evanescent
waves[8]. Recently, N. Engheta, in principle, pointed out
the possibility for having a subwavelength thin compact
cavity resonant which is ﬁlled with a lossless conventional
material and the left-handed medium[9]. In this letter,
we propose a novel coupling system formed by a left-
handed media and want to ﬁnd how LHM takes eﬀect in
a coupling system.

Both the coupled mode theory and the supermode so-
lution method are common methods in analyzing the cou-
pling in a coupler. Compared to the coupled mode the-
ory, the supermode method is more accurate and is still
valid even if the two waveguides are tightly placed[10].
Here we use the supermode solution method to study
the coupling system for the two single-mode waveguides.
Consider a coupling system with coordinates as shown
in Fig. 1 (a). The refractive indices of the core and
the cladding for the waveguides are denoted as n0 and
n1, respectively. The width of each waveguide and the
separation between the two waveguides are d0 and d1,
respectively. The domain between the two dashed lines
represents the coupling region. The propagation con-
stants of the two supermodes are denoted by βe (sym-
metric supermode) and βo (asymmetric supermode). For
this coupling system of two single-mode waveguides, the

the cutoﬀ width of the single-mode waveguide for a spe-
ciﬁc wavelength. The refractive indices of the core and
cladding are n0 = 1.47 and n1 = 1.46, and we ﬁx the
separation between the two waveguides d1 = 6d0. Using
the supermode solution method, we can easily get the
coupling length for this coupling system which has no
LHM inserted. The coupling length is L = 2.057 × 107λ.
Obviously, this coupling system has not shown much in-
terest for us because of the long coupling length (The
future networks will require hundreds of components in
an integrated chip and we need much more compact de-
vices for novel integrated optics applications, including
the coupler). The separation between the two waveguides
is large enough (d1 = 6d0) and the crosstalk between the
two waveguides is quite weak. To enhance the coupling,
the separation between the two waveguides has needed to
be largely reduced, thus the conventional coupler has to
have a long bend arms to connect with the waveguides.
According the physical mechanism of coupling, the most
eﬀective approach for enhancing the coupling is to en-
large the energy for the evanescent wave in the core of

another waveguide.

It is well known that a LHM can amplify evanescent
waves. A naturally attempt is to choose a LHM to insert
into the interior between the two waveguides as shown
in Fig. 1 (a), where n2 and d2 is the negative refractive
index (n2 < 0) and the width of the LHM layer, respec-
tively. To reduce or weaken reﬂection on the boundary
between the cladding and the LHM layer, generally we
choose a LHM which is well matched with the surround-
ing medium, i.e., the cladding medium here. The match-
ing conditions for the two mediums are µ3/ǫ3 = µ4/ǫ4
and n2 = −n1(n1 > 0) (see Fig. 1 (a)). In this system,
the electromagnetic ﬁelds can be decomposed into the E-
and H- polarization modes. Let us consider the E- po-
larization case. Since the two supermodes of this system
have the characteristic of the symmetry or asymmetry,
for simplicity we only need to study the electric ﬁeld dis-
tribution when x > 0 or x < 0. Consider the composite
waveguide system, the electric ﬁeld of a supermode in the
four regions (see Fig. 1 (a)) can be written in the form
of

E1(x) = A exp(−p(x − (d/2 + d0))) exp(iβz),
E2(x) = (B cos(hx) + C sin(hx)) exp(iβz),
E3(x) = (D exp(−px) + E exp(px)) exp(iβz),
E4(x) = F (exp(−qx) ± exp(qx)) exp(iβz),

where σ = 1 or −1, represents the even or odd super-
modes, respectively. Compared with conventional waveg-
uides, the only diﬀerence is the continuous conditions for
the magnetic ﬁeld on the boundary between the 3rd and
4th layer (the LHM layer) since µ4 is negative in the
4th layer while u3 is positive in the 3rd layer. Combin-
ing above expression with Eq.
(1), we can obtain the
coupling lengths for the structure (shown in Fig. 1 (a))
versus the width of the LHM layer (d2). The dependence
of the coupling length on d2 is plotted as the solid line in
Fig. 2. From Fig. 2, one can see that the coupling length
decreases dramatically when the width of the LHM layer
(d2) increases. Due to the function of amplifying evanes-

cent waves, the LHM layer intensify eﬀectively the cou-
pling between the two waveguides. When the width for
the LHM layer changes from 0 to 7λ, the coupling length
decreases rapidly from L = 2.057 × 107λ to L = 212.34λ.
Now we consider an incident wave which enters into
the system and propagates along the z direction. When
it meets the interface of the coupling system with nega-
tive refraction layer and without negative refraction layer
(z = 0), the incident wave will couple and reﬂect simul-
taneously at this interface. Since the mismatch between
the super eigenmodes of diﬀerent parts of the system,
the loss will occur when the electromagnetic wave prop-
agates through this interface (z = 0). Moreover, the loss
will also appear at another interface (z = L, L is the
coupling length for this coupling system) when the elec-
tromagnetic wave propagates out of the coupling region.
Since the coupling system has a characteristic of sym-
metry, the loss at the interface of z = L is the same as
the interface of z = 0. Here we only give out the results
for the loss when the electromagnetic wave goes into the
coupling region. In Fig. 2, the dotted line illustrates the
loss at the interface (z = 0) versus the width of the LHM
layer. From Fig. 2, we know when there is not a LHM in
the system, the energy can be wholly tranmitted into the
coupling region, i.e., there is not any loss at the interface
in this case. When a LHM layer is inserted, the loss be-
gins to appear due to the mismatch of the supermodes.
Although the coupling length decreases rapidly with in-
creasing of the width for the LHM layer (d2), the loss at
the interface occurs and increases fast when d2 reaches
at d2 = 4λ. The loss reaches 70.97% when d2 = 6λ. Al-
though the coupling length for the system with a LHM
inserted is much small L = 1087.7λ when d2 = 6λ, the
loss is too large to make it unvalued.

To avoid the loss at these interfaces, a negative refrac-
tion layer with two symmetric sharp ends is inserted into

the coupling system as shown in Fig. 1 (b). The gradient
of each peak is denoted by tgθ. All of the energy is then
slowly coupled through the interfaces without any loss
provided that the gradient of each peak is enough small
(in our simulations, we take tgθ = 1/20). Using this
structure with the two symmetric sharp ends, the loss
at the interfaces (z = 0 and z = L) can be completely
avoided. Here we also consider the E- polarization as be-
fore. In this case, the propagation constants of the two
supermodes slowly change along z direction with a small
scale and the coupling length satisﬁes

where βe and βo corresponds to the symmetric super-
mode and asymmetric supermode, respectively. Combing
the characteristic equation with above expression, we can
also easily obtain the coupling lengths for the structure
with increasing the center-width of the LHM layer (here
we ﬁx the gradient of ends as tgθ=1/20). The result is
shown in Fig. 3. The dotted and solid lines represent
the coupling length as a function of the width for the
LHM layer with two sharp ends and without two sharp
ends, respectively. From Fig. 3, one can see that the
coupling length for the structure with two sharp ends is
almost same as the structure without two sharp ends.
When the width for the LHM layer is very small, the
contribution of these two ends is quite small and can be
neglected since the height of two ends is much smaller
than the coupling length. With the increasing of the
center-width for the LHM layer, the coupling length for
the structure decreases dramatically as well as the cou-
pling system without ends. When the center-width for
the LHM layer reaches a large value, the coupling length
of the structure with two ends is not consistent with the
results for that of the structure without ends. Under
this condition, two sharp ends play an important role for
coupling since the value for the height of the two ends
is equivalent to the coupling length. The height of each
end is 70λ when d2 = 7λ. When we increases the center-
width for the LHM layer (d2) from 0 to 7λ, the coupling
length decreases from L = 2.057 × 107λ to L = 338.3λ,
which is a little longer than it for structure without ends
(L = 212.34λ). Obviously in this coupling system, an
incident wave can be totally transmitted into the cou-
pling system and ﬁnally leaves without any loss, while
the loss at one interface for the structure without ends
will reach 96.83% when d2 = 7λ. In this coupling sys-
tem, the coupling length becomes very short and there
is not any loss when the center-width for the LHM layer

is d2 = 7λ. For a speciﬁc wavelength (communication
window) λ = 1.55µm, the coupling length is only about
L = 524µm. This structure shows much interest for us
since this kind of coupler is too compact and suitable for
our integral devices applications.

In this letter, we have considered a novel coupler
formed by the left-handed material. Using the super-
mode theory, we analyze the coupling system of two

Excitation theory for space-dispersive active media
waveguides

Anatoly A. Barybin

Abstract.

A uniﬁed electrodynamic approach to the guided-wave excitation theory is
generalized to the waveguiding structures containing a hypothetical space-dispersive
medium with drifting charge carriers possessing simultaneously elastic, piezoelectric
and magnetic properties. Substantial features of our electrodynamic approach are:
(i) the allowance for medium losses and (ii) the separation of potential ﬁelds peculiar
to the slow quasi-static waves which propagate in such active media independently
of the fast electromagnetic waves of curl nature.
It is shown that the orthogonal
complementary ﬁelds appearing inside the external source region are just associated
with a contribution of the potential ﬁelds inherent in exciting sources. Taking account
of medium losses converts the usual orthogonality relation into a novel form called the
quasi-orthogonality relation. Development of the mode quasi-orthogonality relation
and the equations of mode excitation is based on the generalized reciprocity relation
(the extended Lorentz lemma) specially proved for this purpose with allowing for
speciﬁc properties of the space-dispersive active media and separating the potential
ﬁelds. The excitation equations turn out to be the same in form whatever waveguide
ﬁlling, including both the time-dispersive (bianisotropic) and space-dispersive media.
Speciﬁc properties of such media are reﬂected in a particular form of the normalizing
coeﬃcients for waveguide eigenmodes. It is found that the separation of potential
ﬁelds reveals the ﬁne structure of interaction between the exciting sources and mode
in addition to the exciting currents (bulk and surface) interacting with
eigenﬁelds:
the curl ﬁelds, the exciting charges (bulk and surface) and the double charge (surface
dipole) layers appear to interact with the quasi-static potentials and the displacement
currents, respectively.

Introduction

Modern progress of material science and technology opens new potential possibilities
in synthesizing complex and composite media with unique electromagnetic properties
at microwaves and in optics. This requires revising some problems of guided-wave
electrodynamics, in particular, the theory of waveguide excitation by external sources.
The guided-wave excitation theory for passive media with isotropic, anisotropic and bi-
anisotropic properties was developed in [1]. Electrodynamic processes in such passive
media are fully described by Maxwell’s equations and local constitutive relations, the
most general form of which is inherent in bianisotropic media (BAM) with frequency-
dependent constitutive parameters. Although magneto-electric phenomena in such
media, by their microscopic nature, are brought about by non-locality of short-
range polarization responses on electromagnetic actions [2 – 4], their macroscopic
manifestations are actually similar to those for real time-dispersive media. Indeed,
the short-range character of these phenomena enables one to use the plane wave
representation with wavenumber k = ω/c so that in the ﬁrst-order approximation
all the constitutive tensor parameters of such a medium become solely local and
frequency-dependent (see Ref. [2]).

Unlike passive media, a true active medium requires, in addition to Maxwell’s
equations, an appropriate equation of motion for its electrodynamic description.
Among active media we restrict our consideration to three kinds:
(i) piezo-dielectrics with elastic properties providing the technological basis for
acoustic-wave electronics [5 – 7],
(ii) dielectrics with ferrimagnetic properties (magnetized ferrites) forming the
technological basis for spin-wave electronics [8 – 10],
(iii) nondegenerate plasmas with drifting charge carriers (in particular, semiconductors
with negative diﬀerential mobility of hot electrons) constituting the technological basis
for plasma-wave electronics [11 – 14].

For generality, we shall

investigate a hypothetical space-dispersive medium
possessing simultaneously elastic, piezoelectric,
ferrimagnetic and nondegenerate
plasma properties in order to provide speciﬁc relations for any kind of the complex
composite medium as a special case of the general situation developed below.

Space-dispersive properties of such a waveguiding medium are related to non-local
eﬀects caused by speciﬁc interactions between adjacent particles of the active media,
such as elastic interactions in piezo-dielectrics, exchange interactions in ferrites and
carrier diﬀusion eﬀects in nondegenerate plasmas. Neglecting the non-local eﬀects
enables the equations of medium motion to be converted into the constitutive relations
with frequency-dependent parameters.
In other words, such a medium possesses
properties of the usual time-dispersive active medium (TDAM) and in this case its
electrodynamic properties fully conform to the ordinary anisotropic media examined
in [1]. Our subsequent analysis will be based on results obtained there, among them a
novel notion of the mode quasi-orthogonality for lossy waveguides (see section 3 of [1]).
The objective in writing the paper is to generalize the guided-wave excitation
theory developed previously for the waveguiding structures with time-dispersive
bianisotropic media [1] to waveguides ﬁlled with a generalized (hypothetical) space-
dispersive medium which contains all the piezoelectric, ferrimagnetic and plasma
phenomena. Section 2 includes input information about the modal ﬁeld expansions
with separating potential ﬁelds to give a physical insight into the nature of the
orthogonal complementary ﬁelds obtained previously [1]. Since the electrodynamic

3

description of space-dispersive phenomena requires, in addition to Maxwell’s equation,
special equations of medium motion, section 3 is devoted to consideration of the
appropriate equations for three kinds of SDAM. Section 4 is fundamental and begins
with an examination of the generalized reciprocity relation specially derived in the
Appendix. This relation serves as a basis for obtaining the mode quasi-orthogonality
relation and the equations of mode excitation taking into account speciﬁc contributions
from the generalized hypothetical medium. Section 5 contains the general discussion of
physical features in the mathematical description concerning the excitation of lossless
and lossy systems valid for both BAM (see [1]) and SDAM waveguides. Mathematical
notation here is the same as applied in [1], in particular, A stands for scalars, A for
vectors, ¯A for dyadics and ¯¯A for tensors of rank more than two.

2. Modal ﬁeld expansions with separating potential ﬁelds

The fundamental result of the previous examination [1], which was obtained for passive
media (including BAM as the most general case), is the incompleteness of eigenmode
basis for any waveguiding structure inside the excitation source region. This manifests
k AkHk
itself in the fact that the modal ﬁeld expansions Ea =
must be supplemented with the orthogonal complementary ﬁelds Eb and Hb which
are related to the longitudinal components of the external currents J e
i.e.
the complete electromagnetic ﬁelds inside the source region are represented in the
following form (cf. equations (4.8) and (4.9) in [1])

k AkEk and Ha =

P
b and J m
b ,

P

E(rt, z) = Ea(rt, z) + Eb(rt, z) =

Ak(z) Ek(rt, z) + Eb(rt, z)

(2.1)

Xk

Xk

H(rt, z) = Ha(rt, z) + Hb(rt, z) =

Ak(z) Hk(rt, z) + Hb(rt, z)

(2.2)

where an unknown longitudinal dependence of the excitation amplitudes Ak(z) is due
to exciting external sources as well as the complementary ﬁelds Eb and Hb.

In [1] the complementary ﬁelds received a mathematical substantiation as the
orthogonal complement to Hilbert space spanned by the eigenﬁeld basis {Ek, Hk},
but their physical nature is still not properly understood. The present examination
of space-dispersive media enables us to furnish an explanation of these ﬁelds as a part
of the potential ﬁelds generated by external sources.

The basic electrodynamic property of active media is associated with their ability
to support propagating the special kind of slow waves (whose propagation velocity is
much less than velocity of light characteristic of a medium under consideration) such as
the surface acoustic waves (SAW) in elastic piezo-dielectrics [5 – 7], the magnetostatic
spin waves (MSW) in magnetized ferrites [8 – 10] and the space-charge waves (SCW)
in semiconductors with negative diﬀerential mobility of electrons [12 – 16]. These
slow waves, being of multimodal character for composite (multilayered) structures,
constitute the so-called quasi-static part of the total electromagnetic spectrum, whose
principal feature is related to the predominance of a relevant potential ﬁeld (electric
for SAW and SCW or magnetic for MSW) over its curl counterpart.

Representation of the total ﬁelds (E, H) as a sum of their curl (Ec, Hc) and
potential (Ep = −∇ϕ, Hp = −∇ψ) parts is realizable on the basis of Helmholtz’s

4

decomposition theorem [17]. In this theorem, the ﬁelds of every kth eigenmode can
be represented as

Ek = Eck + Epk = Eck − ∇ϕk

Hk = Hck + Hpk = Hck − ∇ψk

(2.3)

where ∇ · Eck = 0 and ∇ · Hck = 0.

Therefore, instead of one set of the total eigenﬁelds {Ek, Hk} forming the basis of
Hilbert space, we now have two sets involving the curl eigenﬁelds {Eck, Hck} and the
quasi-static eigenpotentials {ϕk, ψk}. This extends dimensionality of Hilbert space
and allows us to anticipate the possibility of expanding the complementary ﬁelds Eb
and Hb in terms of the scalar potential basis {ϕk, ψk}.

Let us apply the vector curl-ﬁeld basis {Eck, Hck} to expand the desired curl ﬁelds

Ec(rt, z) =

Ak(z) Eck(rt, z)

Hc(rt, z) =

Ak(z) Hck(rt, z)

(2.4)

and the scalar potential basis {ϕk, ψk} to expand the desired quasi-static potentials

ϕ(rt, z) =

Ak(z) ϕk(rt, z)

ψ(rt, z) =

Ak(z) ψk(rt, z) .

(2.5)

In this case the complete ﬁelds inside the source region can be written, allowing

for relations (2.3), in the following form

(2.8)

From comparison of equations (2.6) and (2.7) with (2.1) and (2.2) it follows that

Formulae (2.8) give the expected expansions of complementary ﬁelds in terms of
the quasi-static potentials of eigenmodes in a speciﬁc form involving the derivatives
dAk/dz in place of the amplitudes Ak as expansion coeﬃcients, which vanish outside
the source region where Ak(z) = const. As evidently follows from (2.6) and (2.7), the
complementary ﬁelds (2.8) are in fact a part of the total potential ﬁelds associated
with external sources, which was formerly unexpandable, whereas the other part is
included in the modal expansions.

All the above results lead us to the important conclusion that the complemented
Hilbert space spanned by two sets of base functions, consisting of the curl eigenﬁelds
{Eck, Hck} and the quasi-static eigenpotentials {ϕk, ψk},
is closed with respect
to any function corresponding to arbitrary external sources because the desired

5

representations for the curl ﬁelds (2.4) and for the quasi-static potentials (2.5) do
not contain any orthogonal complements. So, if we entirely exclude the potential
ﬁelds Ep and Hp from our analysis, by using instead their scalar potentials ϕ and ψ,
together with the curl ﬁelds Ec and Hc, the appropriate sets of the mode quantities
{ϕk, ψk} and {Eck, Hck} will constitute a complete basis that produces the modal
expansions (2.4) and (2.5) with no orthogonal complements. In consequence, the latter
fact provides the disappearance of the eﬀective surface currents J e
s,ef created
by the complementary ﬁelds and given by formula (4.32) in [1].

s,ef and J m

In the subsequent examination, we shall consider that the modal expansions (2.4)
and (2.5) involve the transverse distributions of physical quantities for all the modes
of SDAM waveguide, which are taken to be known from a preliminary solution to the
appropriate source-free boundary-value problem. Hence, the basic task is to ﬁnd the
mode excitation amplitudes Ak(z) inside the external source region.

3. Constitutive relations and equations of motion for SDAM

As was mentioned above, we consider the generalized (hypothetical) medium possess-
ing simultaneously piezoelectrically-elastic, ferrimagnetic and plasma properties and
restrict our consideration to the macroscopic model of SDAM, i.e. the medium under
examination is regarded as a continuum characterized by pertinent phenomenological
parameters. Such is the case in the long-wavelength approximation, when an excita-
tion wavelength is much greater than typical medium dimensions such as interatomic
distances for solids or Debye length for plasmas. For hot electrons in non-degenerate
semiconductor plasmas, this holds true for the hydrodynamic, quasi-hydrodynamic
and local-ﬁeld approximations [14].

3.1. Piezoelectrically-elastic properties of a medium

The stressed state of an elastic medium is speciﬁed by two second-rank tensors: the
stress tensor ¯T and the strain tensor ¯S. The components Sij are related to components
ui of the vector u of medium particle displacement by the known relation [5 – 7]

Sij =

∂uj
∂ri (cid:19)

(cid:18)

(3.1)

(3.2)

The components Tij of stress tensor enter into the dynamic equation for the elastic

medium written in the ordinary form of Newton’s equation [5 – 7]

ρm

dUi

=

∂Tij

or

ρm

dU

= ∇ · ¯T

where ρm is the mass density and U = ∂u/∂t ≡ ˙u is the medium particle velocity.
The left part of equation (3.2) involves the total derivative with respect to time
dU /dt = ∂U /∂t + U · ∇U and the right part expresses the dynamic force F = ∇ · ¯T
exerted on a unit mass element (still without allowing for dissipative eﬀects).

If the elastic dielectric medium possesses piezoelectricity, both the strain ¯S and the
electric ﬁeld E evoke an appearance of the electric polarization P and the elastic stress
¯T . In this case the constitutive relations can be written in one of the conventional
forms (ignoring magnetostrictive eﬀects) [5 – 7]

Pk = ekij Sij + ǫ0 χ S
Tij = c E

ikEi
ijkl Skl − ekij Ek

or
or

P = ¯¯e : ¯S + ǫ0 ¯χ S · E
¯T = ¯¯c E : ¯S − ¯¯e · E.

(3.3)
(3.4)

6

In view of the relation D = ǫ0E + P (3.3) can be rewritten as

Dk = ekij Sij + ǫ S

ik Ei

or

D = ¯¯e : ¯S + ¯ǫ S · E .

(3.5)

In (3.3) – (3.5), the quantities ¯χ S and ¯ǫ S = ǫ0 (¯I + ¯χ S) are the second-rank
susceptibility and permittivity tensors, ¯¯e is the third-rank piezoelectric stress tensor
and ¯¯c E is the fourth-rank elastic stiﬀness tensor (for brevity sake, the superscripts S
and E will be dropped below).

Acoustic-wave propagation losses in solids are caused by two dissipative eﬀects
which can be introduced into the dynamic equation (3.2) phenomenologically by means
of the following quantities:

friction stress ¯T fr

(i) the internal

associated with the existence of viscous
properties of an elastic medium, which should be added to the stress tensor ¯T (to
yield the total stress tensor ¯T Σ = ¯T + ¯T fr) in the form analogous to that used for an
isotropic medium [7]

T fr
ij = ηijkl

∂Skl
∂t

or

¯T fr

= ¯¯η : ˙¯S

where ¯¯η is the viscosity tensor considered as phenomenologically given;

(ii) the dynamic friction force F fr exerted by imperfections of a crystal lattice on
the motion of acoustic phonons, which should be added to the total dynamic force
F Σ = ∇· ¯T Σ in the form of a relaxation term

F fr

i = − τ

or

F fr = − ¯τ −1 · ρmU

where ¯τ −1 is the inverse relaxation time tensor regarged as phenomenologically given.
Allowing for relations (3.6) and (3.7), equations (3.1) and (3.2) are rewritten in

the following form

In the case of pure harmonic processes (with time dependence in the form of
exp(iωt)), the above equations can be linearized in small-signal quantities (marked
by subscript 1 unlike their static values marked by subscript 0) so that ρm =
ρm0 + ρm1, U = U1, etc with |ρm1| ≪ |ρm0|.

3.2. Ferrimagnetic properties of a medium

Macroscopic dynamics of a ferrimagnetic medium uniformly magnetized by an external
static ﬁeld H e
0 to the saturation magnetization M0 is described by the equation of
motion written for the total magnetization vector M in the following form [8 – 10]

∂M
∂t

= − γµ0 (M × Heﬀ) + R

(3.10)

where γ = |e|/m0 is the gyromagnetic ratio for magnetism of spin nature.

The eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld Heﬀ takes into consideration all the torque-producing
0, by: (a) the Maxwellian ﬁeld H (satisfying

contributions caused, in addition to H e

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

7

(3.12)

Maxwell’s equations), (b) the crystal anisotropy ﬁeld Hc = − ¯Nc · M (due to
magnetocrystalline anisotropy of a ferrite material),
(c) the demagnetizing ﬁeld
Hd = − ¯Nd · M (due to shape anisotropy of a ferrite sample), (d) the exchange
ﬁeld Hex = λex∇2M (due to nonuniform exchange interaction of precessing spins),
namely [8 – 10]

Heﬀ = H e

0 + H − ¯N · M + λex∇2M .

(3.11)

Here the net anisotropy tensor ¯N = ¯Nc + ¯Nd allowing for both the magnetocrystalline
anysotropy of a medium and the demagnetization anisotropy of a ferrite sample is
assumed to be known, as well as the exchange constant λex.

The relaxation term R taking account of magnetic losses in ferrites is written in

diﬀerent forms, among them more convenient for us is the Gilbert form [8 – 10]

R = α

M
M0

×

∂M
∂t

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

with the damping parameter α considered as phenomenologically given or found from
the resonance line half-width measurements as α = ∆H/H0 [10].

The Maxwellian ﬁeld H, by its sense, is always a signal quantity, i.e. H ≡ H1,
unlike the total magnetization M which is represented by separating a small-signal
magnetization M1 in the form M (r, t) = M0 + M1(r, t) where |M1| << |M0|. Then
the eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld (3.11) takes the following form

Heﬀ = H0 + H1 − ¯N · M1 + λex∇2M1

(3.13)

where H0 = H e

0 − ¯N · M0 is the static ﬁeld inside a ferrite sample.

3.3. Drifting charge carriers in a medium

For the hydrodynamic description of nondegenerate plasmas with drifting streams of
mobile charge carriers, it is more suitable and even necessary to apply, instead of the
widely-used Eulerian description, a less known polarization description [13, 14, 18, 19].
As known [11 – 14], in the hydrodynamic model of non-degenerate plasmas the
drifting charge carriers (say, electrons) are represented as a charged ﬂuid ﬂow
characterized by such macroscopic quantities as the mean electron density n (or
the charge density ρ = en), the mean electron velocity v (or the current density
J = ρv) and the electron temperature T (or the electron pressure p = nkBT ).
Microscopic processes of scattering and thermal chaotic motion (or diﬀusion) of
carriers are described in this model by such phenomenological parameters as the
momentum relaxation time (or the mean time of free path) τ and the thermal velocity
vT = (kBT /m)1/2 (or the diﬀfuson constant D = v2
T τ ). When intercarrier (electron-
electron) collisions are rather frequent, there is local thermal equilibrium inside the
carrier ensemble with the electron temperature T exceeding a lattice temperature T0
for high electric ﬁelds.

In approximation of the local thermal equilibrium, the hydrodynamic force

equation has the following form [11 – 14]

∂v
∂t

e
m

+ (v · ∇)v =

(E + v × B) −

(3.14)

∇(nkBT )
mn

−

v
τ

where m is the eﬀective electronic mass diﬀerent from the mass m0 of a free electron.

8

Equation (3.14) holds true for the case of uniform stationary heating of electrons
when the electron viscosity, heat ﬂow and thermal perturbations in an electron
ensemble are negligibly small, so that there is no contribution from the so-called
thermoforce and ∇p = mv2
T ∇n [14]. Such a situation takes place when τe << τM ,
where τe is the energy relaxation time determining the rate of electron temperature
perturbations and τM = ǫ/σ = ǫm/e2nτ is the Maxwellian relaxation time determining
the time scale of ac changes in the electric ﬁeld and charge distribution. This condition
means that the temperature keeps pace with signal perturbations in the electric ﬁeld
providing a local relationship between T and E [14]. The latter allows the momentum
relaxation time τ to be considered as a function of the electric ﬁeld magnitude E,
which is given phenomenologically or found from measuring the ﬁeld dependence of
mobility µ(E) = (e/m)τ (E) and diﬀusion constant D(E) = v2

T τ (E).

Strictly speaking, for plasmas placed in a magnetic ﬁeld B the electron heating is

produced by an electric ﬁeld known as the eﬀective heating ﬁeld [14]

E2 + (b · E)2
1 + b2

Eh =

r

where the quantity b = µB takes into account an inﬂuence of magnetic ﬁelds on the
heating eﬀect so that the quantities τ, µ and D now depend on Eh.

For a small-signal situation when E = E0 + E1, B = B0 + B1, Eh = Eh0 + Eh1
and all ac values (marked by subscript 1) are assumed to be much smaller than their
dc counterparts (marked by subscript 0), we have

Thus,

the ﬁeld-charge
force equation (3.14) describes dynamics of
perturbations in hot electron gases characterized by the ﬁeld dependence of momentum
relaxation time τ (E) given phenomenologically, which is known as the local ﬁeld
approximation [14].

The polarization (P ) description holds an intermediate position between the well-
known Lagrangian (L) and Eulerian (E) descriptions. To analyze the small-signal
processes in drifting carrier streams it is customary to consider two states of the

9

stream – unperturbed (without a signal) and perturbed (with a signal). For the two
states in the L-description the motion of a particular group of charges (located inside
a physically inﬁnitesimal volume called the liquid particle) is described by a time
dependence of two radius-vectors r0(t) and r(t) appropriate to the unperturbed and
perturbed stream. The fundamental dynamic variable of the polarization description
is deﬁned as a diﬀerence in these radius-vectors for two positions of the same liquid
particle caused by signal action [14, 18, 19]:

r1(r0, t) = r(t) − r0(t)

(3.17)

which is considered as a function of the unperturbed radius-vector r0 and called the
electron displacement vector . Hence, after introducing the displacement vector (3.17)
the “trajectory” description of electron motion (typical for the L-variables) is replaced
by the “ﬁeld” description (typical for the E-variables). Now we deal with a ﬁeld of the
electron displacement r1(r0, t) which is completely identical to the ﬁeld of the lattice
particle displacement u(r0, t) applied in elasticity theory (see section 3.1).

According to the Eulerian and polarization descriptions, the total instantaneous
velocity v(r, t) of a particular group of charges satisfying the dynamic equation (3.14)
is represented as [14, 18, 19]

v(r, t) = v0(r) + u1(r, t) = v0(r0) + v1(r0, t)

(3.18)

where the static velocity v0 is taken at two positions (perturbed, r, for the E-
description and unperturbed, r0, for the P -description) of the same group of charges.
The small-signal Eulerian (u1) and polarization (v1) velocities are deﬁned by relation
(3.18) at diﬀerent space points but at the same point between them there is the
following relation: v1 = u1 + (r1 · ∇)v0.

The polarization velocity v1 adheres to the equation of motion in the P -variables

which is obtained from equation (3.14) in the following form [14, 19]

∇ × E1 = −

∂B1
∂t

∇ × H1 =

∂D1
∂t

+ J1

∇ · D1 = ρ1

∇ · B1 = 0

where the densities of charge ρ1 and current J1 are represented in P -variables
by (3.22) and (3.23). The induction vectors are associated with the polarization and
magnetization vectors by the known relations [20]

D1 = ǫ0E1 + P1

and

B1 = µ0(H1 + M1) .

(3.25)

For the generalized medium under examination, possessing also piezoelectric and
magnetic properties, its polarization P1 and magnetization M1 adhere, respectively,
to the constitutive relation (3.3) and to the equation of motion (3.10) written in a
linearized form.

The polarization description of plasmas provides a convenient way to make an
artiﬁcial replacement of plasma by an equivalent magneto-dielectric medium without
mobile charges. Indeed, it is known that a real electric dipole p1 moving at velocity
v0 is perceived, by a ﬁxed observer, as two immovable dipoles: electric p1 and
magnetic m1 = p1 × v0 [20]. Hence, the polarization description operating with
the electronic polarization vector p1 allows any charged medium with mobile carriers
to be represented as an equivalent polarized (with p1) and magnetized (with m1)
medium with no mobile charges. In this case Maxwell’s equations (3.24) by inserting
expressions (3.22) and (3.23) can be written in the following form

∇ × E1 = −

∂B1
∂t

∇ × H p

1 =

∂Dp
1
∂t

∇ · Dp

1 = 0

∇ · B1 = 0

(3.26)

where the fundamental vectors E1 and B1 remain unchanged while the vectors H1
and D1 are replaced with their equivalent polarization counterparts H p
1 . The

1 and Dp

11

(3.27)

(3.28)

latter are introduced so that expressions (3.25) would hold their form with the use of
these new vectors, namely

Dp

1 = ǫ0E1 + P Σ
1

and

B1 = µ0(H p

1 + M Σ
1 )

where the total polarization and magnetization vectors deﬁned as

P Σ

1 = P1 + p1

and

M Σ

1 = M1 + m1

take into account the contributions from both a crystal lattice (P1 and M1) and an
electron ensemble ( p1 and m1 ≡ p1 × v0). Thus, the new equivalent ﬁeld vectors
entering into Maxwell’s equations (3.26) in the polarization description are equal to

Dp

1 = D1 + p1

and

H p

1 = H1 + v0 × p1 .

(3.29)

Therefore, using Maxwell’s equations of the “dielectric” form (3.26) enables one to
consider all media including plasmas, as pure dielectric and describe them by applying
the equivalent ﬁeld vectors (3.29), which,
in addition to the lattice polarizations
(electric P1 and magnetic M1), allow for the electronic polarization p1 due to mobile
charge carriers.
In this case, the components of all ﬁeld vectors, as follows from
equations (3.26), are continuous on the boundaries of drifting carrier streams. Such a
feature makes it more preferable to use the equivalent “dielectric” form of Maxwell’s
equations (without J1 and ρ1) instead of the usual form (3.24) (with J1 and ρ1). The
s = n · p1 and surface
point is that the latter generate the equivalent surface charge ρeq
s = (n · p1)v0 on the boundaries of drifting carrier streams [14, 15, 21],
current J eq
which ensures discontinuity in the appropriate ﬁeld components.

4. Orthogonality and quasi-orthogonality of modes and equations of
mode excitation

4.1. The generalized reciprocity relation (the extended Lorentz lemma)

Up to this point, we have considered the source-free region of a waveguiding structure
with SDAM whose electromagnetic properties are described by the usual Maxwell
equations (3.24) or their equivalent “dielectric” form (3.26). The latter form, which
allows for the electronic polarization of drifting charge carriers, along with the lattice
polarization and magnetization, is more suitable for subsequent examinations. Inside
the region of exciting bulk sources (J e
b1) its curl equations are written
for pure harmonic processes in the form

b1, J m

b1, ρm

b1, ρe

∇ × E1 = − iωB1 − J m
b1

and ∇ × H p

1 = iωDp

1 + J e

(4.1)

where the electric and magnetic sources obey the continuity equations

iωρe

b1 + ∇ · J e

b1 = 0

and

iωρm

b1 + ∇ · J m

b1 = 0 .

(4.2)

As follows from (3.27) – (3.29),

in the equivalent magneto-dielectric medium
without mobile charges, characterized by the total (lattice and electronic) polarization
P Σ
1 = M1 + m1, the ﬁeld-intensity vectors E1 and
H p
1 and B1:

1 = P1 + p1 and magnetization M Σ
1 = H1 + v0 × p1 produce the ﬂux-density vectors Dp

1 = ǫ0E1 + P Σ

1 = ǫ0 E1 + P1 + p1

where the vectors P1, M1 and p1 reﬂect physical properties of the medium discussed
in section 3.

A basis for deriving the equations of mode excitation is the reciprocity relation in
complex conjugate form (often called the Lorentz lemma) extended to the generalized
medium under consideration with piezoelectrically-elastic, ferrimagnetic and plasma
properties.

To derive the conjugate reciprocity relation it is necessary, in addition to the
given system of equations (marked with subscript 1), to consider another system
(marked with subscript 2 having also small-signal meaning) whose dynamic equations
are all taken in complex conjugate form (see (5.25) and (5.26) of [1]). A conventional
procedure applied to these equations gives relation (5.27) (see section 5.2.1 in [1]),
which can be rewritten with the aid of equations (4.3) and (4.4) in the following form

The ﬁrst three terms on the right of equation (4.5) are calculated in the Appendix
by the help of the appropriate equations of medium motion for elastic piezo-dielectrics,
magnetized ferrites and drifting charge carrier streams (see section 3). Substitution
of equations (A.10), (A.14) and (A.22) into (4.5) ﬁnally gives the desired reciprocity

Formula (4.15) involves three contributions to the transferred power from the
electromagnetic curl ﬁelds, quasi-electrostatic potential ﬁelds and quasi-magnetostatic
potential ﬁelds. Formula (4.16) reﬂects the interactions of the curl ﬁelds with the
external bulk currents and the potential ﬁelds with the external bulk charges (surface
exciting sources will be considered later).

The generalized reciprocity relation (or the extended Lorentz lemma) in the
form (4.6) (with equations (4.7) – (4.9), (4.12) and (4.13) for the total electromagnetic
ﬁelds or with equations (4.7), (4.9), (4.12), (4.15) and (4.16) for the ﬁelds separated
into curl and potential parts) provides a basis for deriving the mode quasi-
orthogonality relations and the equations of mode excitation in SDAM waveguides.
To this end, the diﬀerential form (4.6) of the reciprocity relation should be converted
into an integral form.

4.2. Quasi-orthogonality and orthogonality relations for SDAM waveguides

Let subscripts 1 and 2 in the reciprocity relation (4.6) correspond to two eigenmodes
with numbers k and l for a waveguiding structure with SDAM in the absence of
sources, i.e. r(b)
kl = 0. Then integrating equation (4.6) over the total cross section S of
the waveguide and applying the integral relation (2.25) in [1] give

dPkl(z)

them) { ˆEk(rt), ˆH k(rt), etc} such that Ek(rt, z) = ˆEk(rt) exp(−γkz), Hk(rt, z) =
ˆH k(rt) exp(−γkz), etc.

In (4.18) – (4.21), following formulae (2.36) and (2.37) of [1], we have introduced
the normalizing (Nkl) and dissipative (Mkl) coeﬃcients constructed of the cross section
eigenﬁeld vectors. Expression for the normalizing coeﬃcients (Nkl = N EM

given by formula (4.55) or (4.57), while the dissipative coeﬃcients are equal to

Formula (4.17) is in fact the required relation of mode quasi-orthogonality which
reﬂects an independent transmission and dissipation of power by any one of mode
pairs (k, l) in a lossy system (see section 3.1 of [1]). The expression of Pkl and Qkl
in terms of Nkl and Mkl is written in (4.18) and (4.19), owing to formulae (2.41) and
(2.42) in [1]. Substitution of (4.18) and (4.19) in equation (4.17) yields the desired
form of the general quasi-orthogonality relation

(γ

or

(γ

k + γl) Nkl = Mkl

(4.23)

which turns into the usual orthogonality relation for lossless waveguiding structures
as a special case with Qkl = Mkl = 0.

Since relations (4.23) are completely coincident with the similar relations (3.6) and
(3.7) of [1], the reasoning given there in section 3, concerning the quasi-orthogonality
of eigenmodes in lossy waveguides (when Mkl 6= 0) and the orthogonality of active
and reactive eigenmodes in lossless waveguides (when Mkl = 0), remains true for the
waveguiding structures with SDAM.

4.3. Equations of mode excitation for SDAM waveguides

To derive the equations of mode excitation, the ﬁelds in the reciprocity relation (4.6)
marked by subscript 1 (which will be dropped for exciting sources) are assumed to
be the desired ﬁelds excited by the bulk and surface sources, whereas those marked
by subscript 2 are the known ﬁelds of the kth mode without sources. Any one of
the physical quantities Φ (e.g. the components of electromagnetic ﬁelds, potentials,
polarizations, etc) is written for the kth mode as
Φk (rt, z ) = ˆΦk (rt) e− γk z

(4.24)

while the same quantity in the source region is represented in the complete form

Φ1 (rt, z ) = Φa (rt, z ) + Φb (rt, z ) =

Al (z ) Φl (rt, z ) + Φb(rt, z )

involving the modal expansion Φa and the orthogonal complement Φb . The latter is
true for all physical quantities except the curl ﬁelds and quasi-static potentials for
which, according to equations (2.4) and (2.5), Ecb = H p

cb = 0 and ϕb = ψb = 0.

The separation of potential ﬁelds causes the surface boundary conditions (formerly
written for the total ﬁelds in the form of relations (4.6) and (4.7) in [1]) to be
reformulatted. Inside the source region, besides the external bulk currents J e,m
and
charges ρe,m
b , there are the surface sources, which are located along the contour Ls
and given in the form of:

s which results in discontinuity in the tangential components of the curl

For deriving the equations of mode excitation it is necessary to integrate the
reciprocity relation (4.6) (with replacing subscripts 2 by k) over the cross section
S of a waveguide by using relation (2.25) in [1], with the result depending on whether
the potential ﬁelds are separated.

Without separating the potential ﬁelds (when E1 = Ea + Eb and H p

sense with respect to the ﬁelds of every kth eigenmode, assures the following quasi-
orthogonality relation for lossy systems:

involving no eﬀective surface currents, unlike the previous case.

All the quantities Nkl and Rk involve the cross-section eigenfunctions (marked by
the hat sign above them) and the z-dependence of the exciting integrals Rk(z) is due
to that of the external bulk and surface sources.

The separation of potential ﬁelds has revealed a ﬁne structure of the interaction
between the external sources and the mode eigenﬁelds (curl and potential), which is
demonstrated by relation (4.58): the currents (electric J e
b,s and magnetic J m
b,s) interact
p
with the curl ﬁelds (electric ˆEck and magnetic ˆH
ck), whereas the charges (electric ρe
b,s
and magnetic ρm
b,s) interact with the quasi-static potentials (electric ϕk and magnetic
p
ψk). Also, there is the interaction of the displacement currents (electric iω ˆD
k and
magnetic iω ˆBk) with the double charge (dipole) layers (electric ηe
s ),
if any. Usually, the latter do not exist in real physical situations, but can be introduced
by the equivalence principle as equivalent surface sources.

s and magnetic ηm

It should be mentioned that the generalized theory of guided-wave interaction,
allowing for the potental ﬁelds, much like the theory elaborated here, was ﬁrst
developed by the author [22]. Both results are in good agreement only for lossless
waveguiding structures, although the problem of the orthogonal complements went
unnoticed then. Allowance for losses was made on the basis of the bi-orthogonality
relation (instead of the quasi-orthogonality relation, as it is done here) which was
obtained by introducing a subsidiary boundary-value problem (called the associated
problem) to change artiﬁcially the sign of a loss parameter. In so doing, the eigenmode
norms for lossy waveguides have no power meaning and the results of mode excitation
pose serious diﬃculties in physical interpretation.

22

5. General conclusions on the excitation theory for BAM and SDAM
waveguides

The ﬁnal equations (4.53) or (4.54) of the waveguide excitation theory developed are
completely identical, by their structure, with equations (5.47) and (5.48) obtained
in [1] for the waveguides with bianisotropic media. They constitute an inﬁnite set of
coupled diﬀerential equations of the ﬁrst order in the desired modal amplitudes Ak
or ak excited by a given distribution of the external sources (bulk and surface) which
enter into the exciting integrals R(b)
and R(s)
k deﬁned by formulae (4.56) and (4.58).
This set of excitation equations can be rewritten in the matrix-operator form

k

¯N · Z(z) = R(z)

(5.1)

where the matrix-operator ¯N formed from the normalizing coeﬃcients is hermitian
(Nkl = N ∗
lk) and the column-vector R has Rk as components. The column-vector Z
is composed from the elements Zk = dak/dz + γkak = (dAk/dz) exp(−γkz).

Generally, the coupled equations developed hold true for dissipative systems since
the coupling coeﬃcient Nkl deﬁned by equation (4.55) or (4.57) determines, according
to (4.18), the cross-power ﬂow Pkl for any one of mode pairs, which is the case for
lossy waveguides. It is evident that these equations remain true for nondissipative
systems as a special case.

For lossless waveguiding structures, the general quasi-orthogonality relation (4.23)
turns into equation (3.10) of paper [1] to produce there the orthonormalization
relations (3.18) and (3.24) for the active and reactive modes, respectively. They can
be written jointly in the combined form

Nkl =

Nkδkl
Nkδ˜kl

(

– for active modes

– for reactive modes

where the norms Nk possess such a property that for an active mode it is real-valued,
whereas for a reactive mode it is complex-valued and Nk = N ∗
(see section 3.2 in [1]).
˜k
Substitution of equation (5.2) into (5.1) yields

Zk =

Rk/Nk
R˜k/N˜k

(

– for active modes

– for reactive modes

As follows from the orthogonality relations (5.2), every eigenmode of a lossless
waveguide is orthogonal to all the other modes, except for the only one in combination
with ﬁelds of which it forms its own norm: the active k-mode is non-orthogonal to
itself but the reactive k-mode is non-orthogonal to its own twin-conjugate ˜k-mode for
which γk +γ∗
= 0. The ﬁelds of such a mode, non-orthogonal to the k-mode, enter into
˜k
the exciting integrals and determine the power of interaction with external sources,
so as to supply the given k-mode independently of the others (see section 3.2 in [1]).
This is true only if the exciting sources are ﬁxed, which lies outside the context of
self-consistent treatment usually applied in practice.

The independent excitation of every mode by given sources described by (5.3) is
inherent only in lossless waveguides. For a lossy waveguide this is not the case. Even
for the ﬁxed exciting sources there is a dissipative coupling among modes expressed
by non-zero oﬀ-diagonal elements Nkl of the normalizing coeﬃcient matrix ¯N . Such a
dissipative coupling implies that, unlike lossless waveguides, the given external sources

(5.2)

(5.3)

23

excite the total set of eigenmodes as a whole rather than every mode as a single. It is
very important to realize that this mode coupling of dissipative character is apparent
since it exists only inside sources. Outside them even the presence of nonzero oﬀ-
diagonal coeﬃcients Nkl leaves all the eigenmodes uncoupled. Indeed, for the source-
free region the right-hand side of equation (5.1) vanishes (Rk = 0) and,
if Nkl 6= 0,
from here it follows that Zk = 0 or Ak(z) = constant.

Hence, the eigenmodes of a lossy waveguide, being linearly independent solutions to
the appropriate boundary-value problem, remain uncoupled outside the source region.
Under these conditions, any eigenmode has the constant value of amplitude that was
gained from sources at the exit boundary of their existence region and propagates
along the waveguide without coupling to other modes. However, the picture of power
transfer is more involved. Every k-mode, besides the self-power ﬂow Pk ≡ Pkk, also
carries the cross-power ﬂows Pkl in pairs, together with the other l-modes, which were
also excited inside the source region and outside have constant amplitudes. According
to the quasi-orthogonality relation in the power form (4.17), any one of mode pairs
has a certain value of the cross-power ﬂow Pkl, as well as the cross-power loss Qkl.
This fact is a physical manifestation of the power non-orthogonality (called the quasi-
orthogonality) among eigenmodes outside the source region. It is the existence of Pkl
proportional to the normalizing coeﬃcients Nkl that results in the apparent coupling
of dissipative character among modes inside the source region, which is described by
equations (4.53) or (4.54) with the exciting sources on the right considered as ﬁxed.

At ﬁrst glance, it may seem that the inﬁnite set of coupled equations like (5.1)
obtained for lossy systems reduces to certain mathematical diﬃculties which are
absent for lossless systems described by the uncoupled equations like (5.3). However,
the diﬀerence between them disappears in the self-consistent formulation of a wave
problem.
In this case, the external sources appearing in Rk themselves can be
represented as series expansions in terms of eigenmodes of another waveguide, which
makes these sources exciting for the waveguide under consideration. Then, the
uncoupled equations for single modes, for example (5.3), turn into an inﬁnite set
of coupled equations (see Refs. [13, 22, 23] where this technique is described). Solving
such coupled equations for lossless systems diﬀers little in computational complexity
from an analogous solution for lossy systems. In both cases, to obtain the total solution
of coupled equations, allowing for interaction between all modes, is unrealizable in
practice. Usually, the major eﬀect of interaction is determined by coupling among
ﬁnite number of modes. Strongly interacting modes can be separated by the coupled-
mode technique [24], which enables an approximate solution to be obtained with a
precision suﬃcient for practical applications.

Thus, we have developed a uniﬁed treatment of the electrodynamic theory of
guided-wave excitation by external sources, applied to any waveguide with composite
and multilayered structures involving complex media, with both bi-anisotropic and
space-dispersive properties.

For the second system, the similar equations are obtained from equations (A.1)
through (A.5) by taking complex conjugation and replacing subscripts 1 with 2 (both
have the small-signal meaning). The equations obtained in such a way are numbered
as (A.1′) through (A.5′), but will not be written explicitly for the sake of brevity.

The ﬁrst term is transformed by using ∇ · J0 = 0, and the result of

with A = r1, B = r∗

2 and C = E0, since ∇ × E0 = 0.

The third term is rearranged by employing (A.16), (A.16′), ∇·B0 = 0, ∇·J0 = 0,

and the identity

A × (B · ∇C) − B × (A · ∇C) = ∇C · (B × A) − (∇ · C)(B × A)

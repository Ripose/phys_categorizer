Abstract

In this paper we introduce a method for ﬁnding a time independent Hamiltonian of a given
dynamical system by canonoid transformation. We also ﬁnd a condition that the system should
satisfy to have an equivalent time independent formulation. We study the example of damped
oscillator and give the new time independent Hamiltonian for it, which has the property of tending
to the standard Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator as damping goes to zero.

Intoduction

It is known that the Hamiltonian description of the system is nonunique. Generally, one can change
phase-space coordinates (q, p) and in some cases it is possible to ﬁnd a Hamiltonian for these new
coordinates. The well known class of such transformations are canonical transformations which preserve
Hamiltonian structure for all possible Hamiltonians ([1], [2]). But there is also much wider class of
transformations, called canonoid which preserve at least one Hamiltonian structure. General theory
of time independent canonoid transformations can be found in [3]. The main goal of this paper is to
develop a method for ﬁnding a time independent Hamiltonian for a given system. We restrict ourselves
to transformations which do not change q, because we could have some physical (e.g. quantum) reasons
for preserving conﬁgurational coordinates. (Without this restriction the problem could be trivial, as the
transformation to coordinates of integrals of motion would yield the Hamiltonian constantly equal to
zero).

The paper is organized as follows. First (section 2) we present theory of canonoid transformations
preserving q. Then (section 3) we ﬁnd additional relations which the transformation must satisfy to
provide the transition to phase space of the time independent Hamiltonian. We also show that such
a transition is not possible for all Hamiltonians, and we ﬁnd equation which is necessary condition for
the system to have a time independent Hamiltonian. Finally (section 4), we test all this methods on
the damped oscillator. We ﬁnd the time independent Hamiltonian for this system, which tends to the
classical Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator as damping goes to zero.

2 Canonoid transformations preserving q

Consider two dynamical systems. One described by coordinates (q, p, t) and the Hamiltonian H0(q, p, t),
and the other expressed by coordinates (q, π,t) and the Hamiltonian H(q, π, t). Let us also have the
(q, ˜p(q, p, t), t) is diﬀeomorphism.
mapping ˜p(q, p, t) between momenta p and π, such that (q, p, t)
We will call H0 and H equivalent if each solution of Hamilton equations for H0 is also (by means of ˜p)
solution of Hamilton equations for H and vice versa. One can easily check that if both Hamiltonians
lead to unique solutions (in terms of initial conditions) then it is suﬃcient only to check the transition
from H0 to H. Condition of equivalence for the inverse transformation is then automatically fullﬁled (at
least locally).

To summarize this section let us write down a general scheme for ﬁnding the new Hamiltonian

equivalent to H0, expressed by the same conﬁgurational coordinates q and some new momenta π.

First one must solve the equations (8a)-(8c) to ﬁnd ˜p i.e. possible transformation of momenta.

Using formula (11) one should ﬁnd H

q=q
|
π= ˜p(q,p,t)

.

Finally, one must ﬁnd the inverse function ˜p−1 and express the new Hamiltonian H as a function
of (q, π, t).

The equations presented in this section are analogous to these in [3], where canonoid transformations

with dependence in q (but not in t) are studied.

3 Time independent Hamiltonian

We are going to ﬁnd additional conditions under which the new Hamiltonian H appears to be time
independent. First note that from equality

one can obtain two useful relations. The ﬁrst one is the well known formula for the derivatives of inverse
function

compound it with ˜p−1 we obtain ∂H

The damped oscillator is a commonly used system for testing theoretical ideas (see e.g.
[5] – covering
topics closely related to ours, or [6] and references there). Let us ﬁnd a time independent Hamiltonian
for it. We additionally want our new Hamiltonian to become the standard Hamiltonian of the harmonic
if there is no damping. There exists an example, given by Havas [4], of the time
oscillator
independent Hamiltonian for damped oscillator. But the Havas Hamiltonian yields quite strange form
in the case when β = 0. As a starting point we use the Hamiltonian

where z = pse−2βt and v(q, z) is an arbitrary (suﬃciently smooth) function of two variables. But ˜p must
also be a solution to (10). If we put (18) to (10) we obtain after some transformations the following

In this result we chose integration constant taking ˜p(q, 0, t) = 0. Note that ˜p is real. The inverse
transformation can be written as follows (we abandon π as a symbol for new momentum because it could
be confusing in context of trigonometric functions; instead we use pn).

One can check by direct calculations that our new Hamiltonian is a real function of q and pn and it gives
equation of motion of damped oscillator. For β = 0 (and consequently τ + = τ − = 1) (24) reduces to

5 Conclusions

We have developed method for generating new Hamiltonians by changing canonical momenta. We have
applied this method to ﬁnd the condition (16) for existence of a time independent Hamiltonian and to
show how to construct it. The ambiguity in Hamiltonians is especially intriguing in quantum context.
We have given example of the damped oscillator and have found the new Hamiltonian for it. We believe
that this new Hamiltonian can yield some interesting results at quantum level.

Equations of Motion of Systems with
Internal Angular Momentum

Manuel Dorado∗
C ENITA, S.A., Miguel Yuste, 12, 28037 Madrid, Spain
Abstract
Using the Euler’s equations and the Hamiltonian formulation, an attempt has been made to obtain the equations
of motion of systems with internal angular momentum that are moving with respect to a reference frame
when subjected to an interaction. This interaction involves the application of a torque that is permanently
perpendicular to the internal angular momentum vector.

INTRODUCTION

The angular momentum of a many-particle sys-
tem with respect to its centre of mass is known as
the ”internal angular momentum” and is a prop-
erty of the system that is independent of the ob-
server.
Internal angular momentum is therefore
and attribute that characterizes a system in the
same way as its mass or charge. In the case of a
rigid body and particularly in the case of an ele-
mentary particle, the internal angular momentum
is also referred to as ”spin”.

To the author’s knowledge, the dynamical be-
haviour of systems with internal angular momen-
tum has not been systematically studied within the
framework of classical mechanics (See References
[1]). This paper approaches this type of problem
through a model comprising a rotating cylinder,
with constant velocity of rotation, around its longi-
tudinal axis. The equations of motion are obtained
using the Euler’s equations and by the Hamiltonian
procedure.

Results coincide when the problem is solved us-
ing vectorial algebra or Lagrangian formalism (un-
published). However, as a result of changes in ”per-
spective”, each method uncovers new peculiarities
regarding the intimate nature of the system’s be-
haviour.

FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM

mass) ~L, whose centre of mass moves at a constant
velocity ~ν with respect to a reference frame which
can be deﬁned as soon as the interaction in the
cylinder starts. It is aimed to obtain the equations
of motion to describe the dynamical behaviour of
the system from the instant that it undergoes an
interaction, by applying a torque ~M that is perma-
nently perpendicular to the internal angular mo-
mentum (See Fig.1).

When solving the problem, the following points

are taken into account:

(a) The cylinder will continue spinning about its
longitudinal axis at a constant angular veloc-
ity ~ω throughout all the movement. In other
words, its internal angular momentum mod-
ule is constant. The energy that the cylinder
possesses as a result of its rotation about its
longitudinal axis is consequently considered to
be internal and does not interfere with its dy-
namical behaviour.

(b) The derivative of the internal angular momen-
tum, ~L, with respect to a frame of axes of iner-
tial reference (X, Y , Z) satisﬁes the equation

d~L
dt !XY Z

 

=

d~L

+ ~Ω × ~L (1)

in which ~Ω is the rotation velocity of the frame
linked to the solid (X ′, Y ′, Z ′) about the frame
of inertial reference axes (X, Y , Z).

Let us consider a rigid cylindrical solid with internal
angular momentum (with respect to its centre of

(c) Only inﬁnitesimal motions are considered that
are compatible with the system’s conﬁgura-
tional variations brought about by the applied
torque.

(d) The total energy of the system is not explicitly

dependent on time.

(e) No term is included that refers to the potential
energy. According to hypothesis, the applied
torque is a null force acting on the system and
the possibility of including a potential from
which the applied torque derives is unknown.

(a) ~ω: the rotational velocity of the body around
its longest axis (let us call it the intrinsic ro-
tational velocity of the body).

(b) ~Ω: the rotational velocity of the system of co-
ordinates associated with the body (X ′, Y ′,
Z ′) viewed from the frame of inertia (X, Y ,
Z).

We can write ~L and ~M , refered to (X ′, Y ′, Z ′),

as follows:

~L = I1ω1~e1 + I2ω2~e2 + I3ω3~e3
~Ω = Ω1~e1 + Ω2~e2 + Ω3~e3
~M = M1~e1 + M2~e2 + M3~e3

So, the equation (2) takes the expression

I1 ˙ω1 + I3ω3Ω2 − I2ω2Ω3 = M1
I2 ˙ω2 + I1ω1Ω3 − I3ω3Ω1 = M2
I3 ˙ω3 + I2ω2Ω1 − I1ω1Ω2 = M3

These equations are known as modiﬁed Euler’s

equations and can also be found in (1.e).

In the case treated above, we must substitute the

angular momentum

HOW TO APPROACH THESE PROB-
LEMS THROUGH THE EULER’S EQUA-
TIONS?

The ﬁgure 1 shows a cylindrical rigid body with
angular momentum, ~L, about its longest axis. We
should consider two referential frames: one associ-
ated with the solid (X ′, Y ′, Z ′), having the Z ′ axis
on the direction of the body’s longest axis. We will
refer this system of coordinates to a inertial frame
(X, Y , Z).

In a given instant, a torque ~M is applied on the

rigid body.

We call ~Ω to the rotational velocity of the sys-
tem of coordinates associated with the solid (X ′,
Y ′, Z ′), viewed from the inertial frame (X, Y , Z).
From here, we will consider the system of coordi-
nates (X ′, Y ′, Z ′) all along the work.

Assuming this situation, it is known that

and:

It is clear that we have two diﬀerent velocities

acting:

Where Ω1 coincides with the known velocity of

precession.

We have obtained that the body moves along a
circular trajectory with a rotational velocity Ω1,
but this is not enough to determinate the radius of
the orbit.

The principle of conservation for the energy

should lead us to the expression for this radius.

Assuming our initial hypothesis, the forces are
applied perpendicular to the plane of movement of
the solid and so, these forces do not produce any
work while the cylinder is moving.

We have two conditions that have to be satisﬁed

by the body while rotating:

(a) Ω = M
L

(b) The total energy should remain constant.

Before the torque is applied the energy of the

cylinder takes the following expression:

Looking at the results arising from the previous
study, we can say that the body rotates following
a circular orbit, with a radius given by the last
expression. This circular trajectory implies that
the velocity vector must precess jointly with the
intrinsic angular momentum vector. From this last
conclusion it can be proved that the force needed
to cause the particle to draw a circular trajectory
is expressed as:

~F = m~ν × ~Ω

(15)

When the internal angular moment of the system
does not coincide with one of the principal axes of
inertia, the treatment of the problem is much more
complex, but as it will be seen in the next section,
the results given above area completely general.

When the torque is acting on the cylinder about

And therefore mr2 ˙θ = const.
In the particular case in which ˙θ = Ω is a con-
stant, r has to be a constant (that is, ˙r has to be
zero) in order to satisfy this equation. We can con-
clude that the body moves in a circular orbit. The
energy takes the following expression:

Both expressions (11) and (13) have to represent
the same energy. Therefore, comparing the two ex-
pressions we can obtain the radius of the orbit:

r =

(11)

The equations of motion are obtained by the Hamil-
tonian formulation, where the independent vari-
ables are the generalized coordinates and moments.
To do this, a basis change of the frame (q, ˙q, t) to
(p, q, t) is made using the Legendre transformation.

From the function

H(p, q, t) =

It should be noted that the Hamiltonian formula-
tion is developed for holonomous systems and forces
derived from a potential that depends on the po-
sition or from generalized potentials. A torque is
applied to the present system. The result of the
forces is zero on the centre of mass and, therefore,
it is meaningless to refer to potential energy.

Further considerations

The Hamiltonian is independent of θ. This is an
expression of the system’s rotation symmetry or,
in other words, there is no preferred alignment in
the plane.

The equation ∂H

∂θ = 0 means that the energy of
the system remains invariable if it is turned to a
new position without changing r, Pr or Pθ. This
aspect is clearly proved.

Worthy of mention in this case is the fact that
the Hamiltonian equations do not provide, in this
type of problem, complete information on the ra-
dial movement. The reason for this is that the cen-
tral force is a function of θ which is a coordinate
that does not appear in the Hamiltonian (it can
be ignored) and can only be calculated using the
constraints.

This proposal is valid for any property of the
particle that displays vectorial characteristics and
is sensitive to an external torque of the type de-
scribed, without the need to ascertain the real phys-
ical nature of that property. The proposal can be
extended to equivalent problems, despite their not
involving the presence of internal angular momen-
tum as a central characteristic.

CHARGED PARTICLE IN A MAGNETIC
FIELD

Let us apply this theory to the speciﬁc case of a
charged particle with spin ~s and magnetic momen-
tum ~µ, moving at a velocity ~ν0 in a uniform mag-
netic ﬁeld of ﬂux density ~B.

As it’s well known, the interaction between ~B
and ~µ makes a torque to act upon the particle. This
situation veriﬁes every condition we have deﬁned in
our hypothesis, and so, the behaviour of the particle
must be in agreement with the theoretical model we
have developed above.

Considering the most general of the cases, let us
suppose that ~µ forms unknown angles θ with ~B
and α with ~ν0. This situation is represented in the
following ﬁgure (See Fig. 2).

Figure 2. Charged particle in a magnetic ﬁeld.

It is clear that the rotation of ~ν0 causes rotation
of the ~ν0 component on the XY plane, ν0xy. Fur-
thermore, according to the theory here presented,
the particle will trace a helix and the ~ν0 compo-
nent in the direction of the Z axis, ~ν0z, will not be
aﬀected.

In this case the angular momentum ~L = ~s.
If the particle stops inside ~B, the rotational
velocity of the angular momentum would be ex-
pressed by:

Ω =

|~µ × ~B|
|~L|

=

| ~M |
|~L|

(33)

(34)

(35)

Obviously, if the angle α formed by ~s and ~ν0
remains constant, the angle γ formed by ~sxy and
~ν0xy will also remain constant. The velocity of ~νaxy
can be calculated merely by calculating the velocity
of ~sxy.

sxy = s sin θ

and

Ων0xy = Ωs0xy =

|~µ|| ~B| sin θ
L sin θ

=

µB
L

We can conclude from this expression that the
angular velocity of the rotation of the particle de-
pends on the magnetic momentum ~µ, the magnetic
ﬁeld ~B in which the particle is immersed and the
spin ~s of the particle, and it is independent of the
relative positions of ~µ, ~B and ~ν0.

In the case in question, the angular velocity of

the rotation of the particle in ~B is expressed by:

~Ω = γ

e
2m

~B

(36)

According to the theory developed above, the
particle will draw a circular trajectory. We can
determine the radius of the orbit drawn by the elec-
tron under the inﬂuence of a magnetic ﬁeld

In the speciﬁc case in which the particle is an
electron, γ has a value of 2 and the radius of the
orbit is calculated from the following equation:

r =

=

ν0
Ω

2mν0
γeB

r =

=

ν0
Ω

mν0
eB

(37)

(38)

From the conclusions summarized above, we
state that the particle is submitted to a central
force aﬀecting the charged particle inside the mag-
netic ﬁeld. To calculate its value, we only need to
recall the formula:

~F = m~ν0 × ~Ω

(39)

and substitute ~Ω for its value previously obtained.
Then we get:

Figure 3. Airmodel with spinning disc

~F = m~ν0 × γ

e
2m

~B

(40)

Basically it consists of a disk that can rotate,
attached on top of the ﬂying model, which provides
the necessary support and speed.

Once again, if we apply this to the case in which
the particle is an electron, the gyromagnetic factor
is 2, and hence

~F = e~ν0 × ~B

(41)

The behaviour predicted by the theory here
shown of a charged spinning particle penetrating
into a magnetic ﬁeld with velocity ν, matches the
one that can be observed in the laboratory, and
the force to which it will be submitted is the well
known Lorentz force.

EXPERIMENTS CARRIED OUT

Airmodel with spinning disc

The airmodel is provided of a strong angular mo-
mentum by mean of a high speed spinning disc at-
tached to it by exerting diﬀerent torques on it, with
the built in ﬂight systems, we achieve modiﬁcations
in its ﬂight trajectory.

The remote control ﬂying model was designed

speciﬁcally to verify this theory (See Fig. 3).

Manoeuvring the ﬂying system, aileron to turn
right and left, elevators to shift upwards and down-
wards and rudder, we can obtain the adequate
torques to aﬀect this motion.

The ﬂying model is controlled by means of a radio
equipment aﬀecting the normal moving elements
and the rotation of the disk.

The ﬁst ﬂight was performed without the disk to

conﬁrm the normal evolution of the model.

Once the normal behaviour of the model in this
conditions was conﬁrmed, the disk was attached on
top of the model.

With the disk still the system behaves in a sim-
ilar way that it did without the disk, although the
stability was slightly aﬀected.

With the disk rotation pointer clock way when we
actuate the ailerons to the left, instead of drawing
a horizontal circumference, it actually goes up even
to the point of performing a loop.

Actuating the elevators upwards causes the
model to turn right, when we actuate the elevators
downwards the model turns to the left.

Spinning top with double suspension
assembly

In this experiment it is proved that the spinning
top cam precess with a non zero radius.

It can be observed as well its extraordinary sen-
sitivity to the torques applied on it, when these
torques have the same direction of the vertical axis,
by modifying the angle between the symmetry axis
of the spinning disc and the earths plane.

For this experiment, a top is mounted with dou-
ble suspension (See Fig. 4) whereby it can behave
according to the general theory or adopt the type
of motion predicted by the classical treatment.

Figure 4. Top mounted with double suspension.

The top is allowed four possible degrees of rota-

tional freedom:
a) AA′ axis: The top rotates about its axis of

symmetry.

b) BB′ axis: The top will rotate about this axis

if nutation is caused.

c) CC′ axis: The top will rotate about this axis

if there is precession.

d) DD′ axis: The system will rotate about this
axis if it behaves according to this theory when
we ﬁxed the CC′ axis to the support.

The gravitational torque follows the direction of
the BB′ axis and it produces an increase in angular
momentum ∆~L which is vectorially added to the
angular momentum ~L of the top, which is in the
direction of the AA′ axis.

Logically, the top and both the AA′ and BB′
axes could occupy any position with respect to the
support frame.

We provide the top with a constant slow velocity,
~ν0. Due the top being mounted on the support
frame, the system will rotate about the DD′ axis.
As ~ν0 is slow, the centripetal acceleration due to
rotation can be considered negligible.

According to the classical explanation, the top
should precess and even achieve a nutation motion
on the support, with an independent slow rotation
motion of the system about the DD′ axis.

.

R =

The general theory establishes that the velocity
of the top, ~ν0, the orbital radius and the preces-
sion velocity of the top are related by the following
expression:

ν
Ω
Surprisingly this means that if Ω and R are con-
stant (the support frame is rigid) there would be
only one velocity ~ν0 for the movement of the top
and a single rotation velocity for the top-support
system about the DD′ axis, independently of the
impulse given to the support in an attempt to
achieve the desired velocity.

For our experiment, we create a rotation veloc-
ity for the top about its axis of symmetry, this axis
(AA′) being maintained initially in a horizontal po-
sition although it can really be in any position.

When the top has reached a high rotation veloc-
ity about its axis of symmetry, the support is given
an impulse so that the top reaches a velocity ~ν and
the system is then left to evolve freely. For now
on, it is also under the inﬂuence of a gravitational
torque.

If the system behaves according to classical the-
ory, precession of the top should not occur with
respect to the support.

If on the other hand its behaviour is that de-
scribed by this theory, precession should occur with
respect to the DD′ axis.

The results of the experiment conﬁrm that the
top, in agreement with the theory, move about the
DD′ axis with a velocity

ν0 = R × Ω0

and is independent of the impulse it may have re-
ceived.

In fact the following situations can occur:

a) That the impulse received may be bigger than
that required to reach a velocity ~ν0. The ve-
locity of movement of the top will in all cases
be ~ν0. However, the angle formed by the axis
of symmetry (AA′) and the vertical axis (CC′)
decreases and there is an increase in potential
energy

It should be remembered that ~Ω is constant and
independent of the angle formed by the AA′ and
CC′ axes while ~L remains constant.

b) That the impulse received is equal to that re-
quired to reach a velocity ~ν0. In this case the
position of the top does not vary with respect
to the support. The system rotates about the
DD′ axis.

c) That the impulse received is less than that re-
quired to reach a velocity ~ν0. In this case the
system continues to move with a velocity ~ν0,
but the angle formed by the AA′ and the CC′
axes increases.

Pendulum with internal angular mo-
mentum

Two experiments are performed with this device:

a) Measure the curvature of the trajectory at the
very ﬁrst instants of its evolution, where we
assess that it is close to a circular trajectory.

b) Check that the ﬁnal trajectory is an ellipti-
cal one in which the perihelio of the orbit ad-
vances.

This experiment is performed with a pendulum
that consist of a ﬁbre-glass sphere. The sphere
houses a disk that can rotate around its transversal
axis (See Fig. 5).

The pendulum is suspended from a wire attached
to a point one centimeter distant of the edge of the
disk shaft.

If we observe the evolution of the pendulum when

the inner disk stands still, it is the ordinary one.

We force the disk to rotate until the maximum
speed is reach. At that moment we let the sphere
free. The system is under the inﬂuence of a torque
caused by its weight and the wire strain.
If we
measure the trajectory at the very ﬁrst instants of
its evolution, it happens to be a round one.

Letting the sphere to move, after while it follows
an elliptical orbit, on which the perihelium shifts in
time, in good agreement with this theory (See Fig.
6).

This phenomenon is similar to the one occurring
in the shift of a planet orbit perihelium. And it
is similar, as well, to the Larmor precession of a
charge in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld.

Figure 5. Pendulum with internal angular momentum.

As in the previous experiment, if we reverse the
direction of the disk rotation the orbit perihelium
will also shift in the opposite way that it did before.

The torque will be

With this experiment it is proved that the direc-
tion way of the precession can be manipulated in
accordance with the torque applied.

For the this experiment we have a magnetized

rod, a aluminium cone and a magnet.

~M = ~r × m~ν × ~Ω = ~L × ~Ω

(45)

We attach the rod to the cone. We have build

up a magnetized spinning top (See Fig. 7).

EXPERIMENT SUGGESTED TO TEST
THIS THEORY: INTERACTION OF A
HOMOGENEOUS MAGNETIC FIELD
AND A PERPENDICULAR GYRATING
MAGNETIC FIELD, WITH A PARTICLE
WITH SPIN AND MAGNETIC MOMENT

Formulation of the problem

The particle with spin, ~S, moves with velocity ~ν. It
ﬁrst passes into a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld ~B′,
inducing the magnetic moment, ~µ, of the particle,
polarized in the direction of the ﬁeld. It later enters
a region in which a homogeneous ﬁeld, ~B, and a
gyrating ﬁeld, ~H0, with rotation frequency,
˙φ, are
superposed. Fields ~B′ and ~B are parallel and in
fact could even be the same ﬁeld, although their
function is diﬀerent in each region.

Reference frame (See Fig. 8).
XY Z Fixed system in the particle but which

does not rotate with this.

~B is on the Z axis.
~H0 is on the XY plane.

X ′Y ′Z ′ Fixed frame in the particle which pre-

cesses with this.

~S and ~µ are on the Z ′ axis.
~ν is on the Y ′ axis.

X0Y0Z0 Reference frame from which observa-

tions are made.

~B is on the Z0 axis.
~H0 is on the X0Y0 plane.

It is proved that ˙ψ = ωZ′ . The proof is easy, for if
the Z ′ axis is ﬁxed, i.e. both φ and θ are constant,
the rotations about the Z ′ axis are rotations of the
X ′ and Y ′ axes in the X ′Y ′ plane. Hence, the Euler
angle that reports the rotation is ψ. It can then be
concluded that

˙ψ = ωZ′

(54)

By agreement, but without loss of generality, let
us consider that the particle has an angular mo-
mentum, ~S, that is constant in module.

Frame of axes linked to the solid

In the deﬁnition of the frame of axes linked to the
solid, we can either choose:

a) The frame of axes strictly accompanies the
in classical

particle in the rotation which,
terms, gives its internal angular momentum.

b) The frame of axes linked to the solid is de-
ﬁned by a parallel axis to the internal angu-
lar momentum of the particle, and the other
two are perpendicular to each other and are
in a plane which is perpendicular to the angu-

is understood to be a quality of the particle
whose mathematical characteristics coincide
with those of the angular momentum, without
considering the physical nature of this quality.
In other words, no hypothesis is formed as to
whether or not the angular momentum implies
rotations of the particle under study.

For the purposes of our problem, deﬁnition (b)

However, it should be remembered that our par-
ticle can reach a rotation velocity, ~ω, as a result of
the interactions to which it can be subjected.

Analysis of the interactions

Given the nature of our problem, the particle pen-
etrates a homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, ~B, inducing
the magnetic moment, ~µ, of the particle, polarized
in the direction of the ﬁeld.

Hence, when the particle penetrates the magnetic
ﬁeld, ~B (parallel to ~B′, and can even coincide with
it) and ~H0, the magnetic moment, ~µ, is only (ini-
tially) sensitive to the gyrating magnetic ﬁeld, ~H0.

has been used.

Figure 8. Reference frames.

The rotation velocity, ~Ω, of the frame of axes
linked to the solid, X ′Y ′Z ′, will be expressed within
this system as:

This rotation velocity, ~Ω, can also be expressed
with respect to the frame of reference axes, XY Z
by using Euler angles.

Ω1 = ˙φ sin θ sin ψ + ˙θ cos ψ
Ω2 = ˙φ sin θ sin ψ − ˙θ cos ψ
Ω3 = ˙φ cos θ + ˙ψ

(52)

Our particle can also rotate with respect to the
frame of axes, X ′Y ′Z ′, and the most general ex-
pression to describe this angular velocity is:

~ω = ωX ′~i′

+ ωY ′~j′

+ ωZ′~k′

Figure 9. Interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld, ~H0.

This, consequently, will be the ﬁrst interaction that
we analyze.

Interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld,
~H0

The interaction of the gyrating magnetic ﬁeld, ~H0,
with the magnetic moment, ~µ, does not modify the
energy of the system, as both are permanently per-
pendicular.

The energy of the interaction is expressed

The interaction between ~H0 and ~µ, is equivalent
to the action of a torque, ~ΓH, on the particle, where

~
ΓH = ~µ × ~H0

(56)

~ΓH is perpendicular to the X ′ and Z ′ axes, and

is located on the Y ′ axis.

By using the previously obtained Euler equations

(9) and applying them to our problem:

˙ωZ′ =

Ω1 =

= 0 = ˙ψ

=

µH0
S

M3
I3
ΓH

M1
S

Ω2 =

= 0

so that ˙ψ = 0 in all cases, given that M3 = 0 at all
times. We can avoid ψ by making it equal to zero
in all case (See Fig. 9).

The Euler equations depending on the Euler an-

gles (52), are simpliﬁed with the result that

Ω1 = ˙θ =

µH0
S

Ω2 = ˙φ sin θ = 0
Ω3 = ˙φ cos θ

from which it is deduced that

~θ =

µH0
S

˙φ = 0
Ω3 = 0

(59)

in other words, the rotation of the frame linked to
the solid on X ′Y ′Z ′, Ω1, is constant and equal to ˙θ,
where ˙θ is the rotation of the frame of axes linked
to the solid with regard to XY Z expressed in the
Euler angles.

We have obtained the rotation velocity, ˙θ, but we
have to calculate the rotation radio r(t) if we want
to know the trajectory. To do this we will use the
following equality between diﬀerential operators,

d
dt

=

d∗
dt

+ ~Ω×

,

where
d
dt is the derivative in the inertial frame, in our case
X0Y0Z0,
d∗
dt is the derivative in the non-inertial frame, in our
case X ′Y ′Z ′,
~Ω is the angular rotation velocity of the frame of
axes linked to the solid in relation to the inertial
frame of axes.

We will apply this equality to ~r, a vector of posi-
tion of one frame with respect to another, and for
convenience we will express all the vectors in the
X ′Y ′Z ′ frame.

d∗~r

If we represent the equation in components, we

have

˙rX ′ + rZ′ Ω2 − rY ′Ω3 = νX ′
˙rY ′ + rX ′ Ω3 − rZ′ Ω1 = νY ′
˙rZ′ + rY ′Ω1 − rX ′ Ω2 = νZ′

(61)

Taking into account the initial conditions (See

Fig. 10), Ω2 = 0 and Ω3 = 0.

Interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld ~B
At the moment the circular trajectory is com-
menced, θ is no longer null and the interaction with
the ﬁeld, ~B, begins (See Fig. 11).

system, as explained beforehand, so the module of

and, νX ′ = 0, νY ′ = ν, νZ′ = 0.

As the energy of the system cannot vary, ˙rX ′ =
˙rY ′ = ˙rZ′ = 0. If they diﬀered from zero tangen-
tial accelerations would be involved and therefore
a variation in the total energy of the system.

These conditions simplify the equations of our

system (61) and we obtain

rZ′ = −

ν
Ω1

(62)

This is to say, the particle and the frame of axes
linked to the particle describe a circular trajectory
with respect to the observation frame. The move-
ment plane is perpendicular to ~H0.

M3 continues to be null and, therefor, so do ˙ψ
and ψ, which do not vary, but Ω2 is now diﬀerent
from zero.

These are the expressions of the rotation of the
frame of axes linked to the solid in the base that
deﬁnes the trihedral linked to the solid.

We can also express this same rotation velocity of
the frame of axes linked to the solid with respect to
the reference frame, by means of the Euler angles,

but in the base deﬁning the trihedral of reference
frame.

The behaviour of the particle indicates that it is

subjected to two central forces

ωX = ˙θ cos φ + ˙ψ sin θ sin φ
ωY = ˙θ sin φ − ˙ψ sin θ cos φ
ωZ = ψ cos θ + ˙φ

As ˙ψ = ψ = 0, we obtain

ωX = ˙θ cos φ
ωY = ˙θ sin φ
ωZ = ˙φ

(70)

~F1 = m~ν × ~Ω1 = m~ν × ˙θ~i′
~F2 = m~ν × ˙φ~k
From an energy point of view, we can conﬁrm
that the magnetic ﬁeld, ~H0, does not modify the
energy of the system, and that the magnetic ﬁeld,
~B, cyclically modiﬁes the potential energy of the
particle, since

(71)

(67)

(68)

These expressions clearly reﬂect the behaviour of
the frame of axes linked to the solid and of the solid,
with respect to the reference axes.

Visualization of the movement is assisted by con-

sidering the following speciﬁc situations ˙φ = 0

i) For φ = 0

We would have a rotation about the X axis.

j) For φ = π
2

ωX = ˙θ
ωY = 0
ωZ = 0

ωX = 0
ωY = ˙θ
ωZ = 0

We would have a rotation about the Y axis.
The rotation velocity in the XY plane is

~ωXY = ˙θ(cos θ~i + sin θ~j)

|~ωXY | = ˙θ

(69)

Therefore, the total movement is a circular tra-
jectory of radius, rZ′ , perpendicular to the ﬁeld,
~H0, which in turn spins about the ﬁeld, ~B, with
velocity ˙φ (classically know as Larmor rotation fre-
quency). This explains why the frequency of the
oscillating ﬁeld, ~H0, has to coincide with the Lar-
mor frequency.

EB = ~B · ~µ cos θ

but with its kinetic energy unvaried.

Additional considerations

The reader will have already noted the similarity
between this behaviour and the Larmor eﬀect.

It is know that this eﬀect is produced by applying
a magnetic ﬁeld, ~B, to a particle of charge, q, mov-
ing in an orbit around a ﬁxed speciﬁc charge, q′.
The result is a precession of the trajectory around
the direction of the applied magnetic ﬁeld, with a
precession velocity, ωL = qB
2m , know as Larmor fre-
quency, with the proviso that the cyclotronic fre-
quency is directly obtained by this procedure.

This statement can be expressed by saying that
the angular momentum vector of the particle with
respect to the rotation axis, referred to as orbital
angular momentum, precesses about the direction
of the magnetic ﬁeld, ~B.

From our procedure, it is particularly easy to

reach the same conclusions by considering that

By substituting our development, ~F = m~ν × ~Ω,

in (73) we obtain

d~L

= ~ΓB = ~r × ~F

~L = ~r × m~ν

d~L

= ~r × (m~ν × ~Ω)

= (~r × m~ν) × ~Ω = ~L × ~Ω

Experimental conditions

(the triple vector product does not generally
fulﬁll the associative property, but it can be de-
mostrated in our.)

Equation (74) describes the angular momentum
precession about the magnetic ﬁeld with a preces-
sion rate ~Ω.

The Larmor eﬀect results from subjecting the
particle to the Lorentz central force, because it is
within ~B. From the following, the Lorentz force is
equivalent to our force, given that

F = mνΩ = mν

B = eνB

Which demostrates that both movements are

equivalent.

This experiment can be carried out by emulating
the rotating magnetic ﬁeld using a radio frequency
magnetic ﬁeld, just as Rabi did in his experiments.

Rabi’s experiment (see References (2)) consists
of a collimated particle beam that crosses an inho-
mogeneous magnetic ﬁeld. It later passes through a
region where a homogeneous and a radio frequency
magnetic ﬁeld are superposed, and ﬁnally passes
through an inhomogeneous ﬁeld that refocuses the
beam towards the detector.

The inhomogeneous ﬁelds separate the beam into
diﬀerent beams according to their magnetic mo-
ment (the dependence this on the spin) as in an

CONCLUSIONS

When a system with internal angular momentum,
moving at constant velocity with respect to a ref-
erence frame, is subjected to an interaction of the
type under study, i.e., a torque perpendicular to the
internal angular momentum vector, it will begin to
trace a circular path of radius

where Ω = M
L

Its behaviour is equivalent to that produced by

subjecting the cylinder to a central force

r =

ν
Ω

~F = m~ν × ~Ω

As it can be seen in ﬁgure 14, the trajectory
which particle follows is the trajectory II, while the
trajectory I is the intuitive one, but as it has been
shown in this paper it is not the real behaviour of
the particle.

experiment of Stern-Gerlach. When leaving the
ﬁrst ﬁeld, these beams later pass into the second
inhomogeneous ﬁeld, which refocuses the beams to
the detector. By adjusting the second inhomoge-
neous magnetic ﬁeld we will obtain refocusing con-
ditions for a beam or group of beams.

In the central part of the experimental arrange-
ment, the homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld is super-
posed on the radio frequency ﬁeld. In this region,
the spin and magnetic moment are deﬂected with
respect to the constant ﬁeld when the oscillating
ﬁeld frequency approaches the Larmor precession
frequency. This process is know as nuclear mag-
netic resonance.

After deﬂection, the atom is on another level
which will not fulﬁll the refocusing condition and
a decrease in the beam intensity will be observed
in the detector. This procedure is used to study
nuclear spin, nuclear magnetic moments and hy-
perﬁne structures. However, the behaviour of the
particles in Rabi’s experiment is theoretically jus-
tiﬁed in our exposition and it is therefore unnec-
essary to use inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁelds (as is
required in Rabi’s experiments).

Our experiment only requires the presence of a
homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld to induce the magnetic
moment, ~µ, of the particle, polarized in the direc-
tion of the ﬁeld.

In such a way that:

1o Only those particles whose Larmor frequency,
˙φ, coincides with the radio frequency will
abandon the rectilinear trajectory.

2o The trajectory described by these particles
should coincide with that of the theoretical so-
lution given in this article while they remain
within the region in which the two ﬁelds co-
exist. According to this solution, the parti-
cle abandons the rectilinear path and the XY
plane.

3o When the particle abandons the region of co-
existing ﬁelds, it will follow a rectilinear move-
ment but will not reach the detector.

4o This procedure facilitates selection of the dif-
ferent angular moments because of their de-
pendence on the Larmor precession.

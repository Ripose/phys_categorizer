Introduction

It is well known that in classical mechanics the knowledge of all ﬁrst integrals
of motion of a given problem is equivalent to ﬁnding its complete solution.
Nowadays the search for ﬁrst integrals has assumed an increasing impor-
tance in the determination of the integrability of a dynamical system. It is
extremely important to know if a non-linear dynamical system will present
chaotic behavior in some regions of the phase space. The notion of integrabil-
ity is related to the existence of ﬁrst integrals of motion. Several methods of
ﬁnding ﬁrst integrals are available in the literature for example, Lie’s method
[1], Noether’s theorem [2], or the direct method [3]. Even if not all ﬁrst in-
tegrals of motion associated with the problem at hand are found, it may
happen that the ones which are obtained contribute to the discovery of the
solution we are seeking for. Nevertheless, if we do ﬁnd the solution we are
after by solving the equations of motion in a straightforward way, it still may
be proﬁtable to look for additional constants of motion. Such is the case of
the Kepler problem where the knowledge of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector
[5], [6] allows us to obtain the orbit in a simple way.

Of the inexhaustible wealth of problems which we can ﬁnd in classical
mechanics one of the most aesthetically appealing and important is the cen-
tral ﬁeld problem. Energy and angular momentum associated with this type
of ﬁeld are well known conserved quantities. However, other vector and ten-
sor conserved quantities have been associated with some particular central
ﬁelds. The Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector is a vector ﬁrst integral of motion for
the Kepler problem; the Fradkin tensor [7] is conserved for the case of the
harmonic oscillator and for any central ﬁeld it is possible to ﬁnd a vector ﬁrst
integral of motion as was shown in [4]. In the general case these additional
integrals of motion turn out to be complicated functions of the position r and
linear momentum p of the particle probing the central ﬁeld. When orbits
are closed and degenerated with respect to the mechanical energy, however,
we should expect these additional constant of motion to be simple function
of r and p. In this article we wish to exploit further this line of reasoning by
determining the existence of such additional vector ﬁrst integrals of motion
for the time-dependent Kepler and isotropic harmonic oscillator problems.
In particular, we will show that for the time-dependent Kepler problem the

2

existence of a vector constant of motion coupled to a simple transformation
of variables turns the problem easily integrable.

The structure of this paper goes as follows: in section 2 we establish the
conditions which guarantee the existence of a vector ﬁrst integral for a general
central force ﬁeld. In section 3 we put the method to test by rederiving some
well known results such as the conservation of angular momentum in an
arbitrary central ﬁeld, the conservation of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector for
the Kepler problem, and the conservation of the Fradkin tensor ﬁxing en route
these speciﬁc ﬁelds to which they correspond. In section 4 we consider the
time-dependent case establishing generalizations of the examples considered
before and presenting new ones. In section 5 we show that the existence of
a vector ﬁrst integral enable us to ﬁnd the orbits of a test particle. This
is accomplished for the case of harmonic oscillator, and the time-dependent
Kepler problem. Also the period of the time-dependent Kepler problem is
obtained. Finally, section 6 is reserved for ﬁnal comments.

2 Constructing vector constants of motion

The force f (r, t) acting on a test particle moving in a central but otherwise
arbitrary and possible time-dependent ﬁeld of force g(r, t) can be written as

f (r, t) = g(r, t) r,

(1)

where r = r (t) is the position vector with respect to the center of force, r is
its magnitude, and t is the time. To this test particle we assume that it is
possible to associate a vector j which in principle can be written in the form

j (p, r, t) = A (p, r, t) p + B (p, r, t) r,

(2)

where p = p (t) := m ˙r (t) is the linear momentum, m is the reduced mass
and A, B are arbitrary scalar functions of p, r and t. Taking the total time
derivative of (2) and making use of Newton’s second law of motion we readily
obtain

d j
dt

=  Ag +

dB

dt ! r +  dA

B

m! p.

(3)

If we assume that j is a constant of motion it follows that the functions A
and B must satisfy

3

Ag +

= 0.

Eliminating B between (4) and (5) we obtain

It follows from (5) that j can be written in the form

m

d2A
dt2 − gA = 0.

j = A p − m

dA

r.

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

Therefore, since (6) is equivalent to both (4) and (5) if the ﬁeld g(r, t) is
known any solution of (6) will yield a vector constant of motion of the form
given by (7). Equation (6), however, is a diﬀerential equation whose solution
may turn out to be a hard task to accomplish. Nevertheless, we can make
progress if instead of trying to tackle it directly we make plausible guesses
concerning A thereby linking j to speciﬁc forms of the ﬁeld g(r, t). This
procedure is tantamount to answering the following question: given j what
type of central ﬁeld will admit it as a constant of motion? The answer is
given in the next section.

3 Simple examples

With r, p and a unit constant vector ˆu we can construct the following scalars:
ˆu · r, ˆu · p and r · p. Other possibilities will be considered later on. For
the moment let us consider some simple possibilities for the scalar function
A(p, r, t).

Consider ﬁrst A(p, r, t) = ˆu· r. It is immediately seen that this choice for

A satisﬁes (6) for any function g(r, t). The constant vector j reads

(8)
and it can be related to the angular momentum L = r× p as follows. Firstly
we recast (8) into the form

j =(ˆu · r) p−(ˆu · p) r,

j = M · ˆu,

4

(9)

where M = p r − r p. Since ˆu is a constant vector we conclude that the
constancy of j is equivalent to the constancy of M whose components are
Mjk = pjxk − xjpk, with i, j, k = 1, 2, 3. The antisymmetrical tensor M
In fact, it
is closely related to angular momentum L of the test particle.
can be easily shown that −2Li = εijkMjk, where Li is the i-th angular mo-
mentum component and εijk is the usual permutation symbol or Levi-Civita
density. Therefore, this simple choice for A leads to conservation of angular
momentum for motion under a central arbitrary ﬁeld g(r, t).

Consider now the choice A(p, r, t) = ˆu · p. Then making use of Newton’s

second law it follows that (7) is satisﬁed if we ﬁnd a solution to

d g(r, t)

dt

ˆu · r = 0.

(10)

.

For arbitrary values of ˆu · r we can ﬁnd a solution to (10) if and only if
g(r, t)≡ 0, or g = g0 where g0 is a constant. In this case we can write

j = (ˆu · p) p − g0 (ˆu · r) r.

(11)

If we choose the constant to be equal to −k then the central force ﬁeld
will correspond to an isotropic harmonic oscillator, f = −k r. As before, (11)
can be recasted into the form

where F is given by

j = 2 m F · ˆu,

F =

p p
2m

+ k

r r
2

.

(12)

(13)

The tensor F is symmetrical and is known as the Fradkin tensor [7]. Finally,
consider A = r · p. For this choice of A (7) yields

1
g

dg
dt

+

3
r

dr
dt

= 0,

(14)

where we have made use of (1) and also of the fact that dˆr/dt and r are per-
pendicular vectors. Equation (14) can be easily integrated if g is considered
to be a function of the radial distance r only. If this is the case we obtain
the Kepler ﬁeld g(r) = −k/r3. The constant vector j is then given by

j = (r · p) p − (p · p) r + mk

r
r

,

(15)

5

Making use of a well known vector identity we can recast (15) into the form,

j = L × p − mk

r
r

.

(16)

Therefore j can be equaled to minus the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector A. From
(16) and the condition j · r = −A · r = 0 the allowed orbits for the Kepler
problem can be obtained in a simple way, see for example [5].

4 Time-dependent ﬁelds

Let us now consider time-dependent central force ﬁelds for which we can build
more general vector ﬁrst integrals of motion. As with the time-independent
case there are of course several possibilities when it comes to the choice of a
function A for a time-dependent central ﬁeld. Here is one

A = φ(t) r · p + ψ(t) r · r.
Evaluating the second derivative of (17) we obtain

Where we have made use of (1). If we impose the additional condition

dφ

we eliminate the quadratic term in p. With the condition given by (19)
we can substitute for ψ in (17) and (18) and take the results into (6) thus
obtaining

.

(22)

(23)

(24)

where we have made used of the fact the angular momentum is constant for
any arbitrary central ﬁeld whether it is time-independent or not. If in (24)
we set φ = 1 and C 6= 0, then from (22) we see that g (r, t) is the Kepler ﬁeld
and j is minus the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector as before; the scalar function
A (r, p, t) reduces to r· p which we have already employed in section 3. If we
set (m/φ) d2φ/dt2 = −k(t), that is, if φ is an arbitrary function of the time,
and also C = 0, we have the time-dependent isotropic harmonic oscillator
ﬁeld, F (r) = −k(t) r. In this case j is equal to the ﬁrst term on the R.H.S.
of (24). If (m/φ)d2φ/dt2 = −k and C = 0, we have the time-independent
isotopic harmonic oscillator ﬁeld but this time j is not the same vector as the
one we have obtained before. The reason for this is our choice (17) for the
scalar function A (r, p, t) which is not reducible to the form ˆu · p employed
previously.
As a last example let us consider again the time-dependent isotropic har-
monic oscillator and show how it is possible to generalize the Fradkin tensor
for this case. Let the function A (r, p, t) be written as

The ﬁrst and the second derivative of A read

We can solve (30) thoroughly if g (r, t) is a function of the time t only. In
this case, as before, we end up with the time-dependent isotropic harmonic
oscillator. The vector j associated with (25) can be obtained as follows: ﬁrst
we integrate (29) thus obtaining

It is not hard to see that the trace of this generalized Fradkin tensor F (r, p, t)
becomes the energy of the particle when g (r, t) is a constant ﬁeld.

5 Obtaining explicit solutions: An alterna-

tive way

Now we wish to show how to take advantage of the vector constant j to obtain
the solution for the Kepler and the isotropic harmonic oscillator potentials.
But ﬁrstly we must establish some very general relationships between the
sought for solution r (t) and A (r, p, t) and j. First notice that (10) can be
recasted into the form

dt "
j = m A (r, p, t)2 d

r

A (r, p, t)# ,

(37)

where it must be kept in mind that A (r, p, t) satisﬁes (6). As we have seen
before in speciﬁc examples the form of the vector constant j depends on the
force acting on the particle. Integrating (37) we readily obtain

9

r (t)

A (r, p, t) −

r (0)

A (r, p, 0)

=

j

m Z t

0

dτ

A (r, p, τ )2 .

(38)

limit t → ∞ the deﬁnite integral R t

Equation (38) can be given a simple but interesting geometrical interpreta-
tion. Assume that the initial conditions r (0) and p (0) are known and there-
fore the function A (r, p, 0) can be determined. The vector r (0) /A (r, p, 0)is
therefore a constant and completely determined vector. As time increases,
the R.H.S. of (38) increases. The vector on the right side of (38) though
varying in time has a ﬁxed direction which is determined by j. Therefore,
r (t) /A (r, p, t) must increase in order to close the triangle whose sides are
the three vectors involved in (38). If the orbit is unlimited then it is easy
to see that the following property ensues: there is an asymptote if in the
A2 is constant. On the other hand,
if the orbit is limited, but not necessarily closed, there will be a position
vector r whose direction is parallel to that of the vector j at the instant
t∗.
If the length of the position vector r is ﬁnite, we can conclude that
at the same instant t∗ the function A (r, p, 0) must be zero. Thus, we can
see that the vector r (t) /A (r, p, t) must be reversed at this instant and its
evolution is determined by the fact that its end is on the straight line that
contains j. For t = t∗ + ǫ, where ǫ is a positive inﬁnitesimal number, the
vector r (t∗ + ǫ) /A (r, p, t∗ + ǫ) changes its direction abruptly, so to speak,
as shown in the ﬁgure, hence in the transition A (r, p, t∗) → A (r, p, t∗ + ǫ)
the scalar function must change its sign.
Let us obtain the solution r (t) for the case of the isotropic harmonic
oscillator. A particular solution of (17) for g = −κ, where κ is the elastic
constant is given by

dt

0

A(t) = cos(ωt) ,

(39)

where ω = q k

us to write

m is the angular frequency. The solution given by (39) allows

r (t)
cos(ωt) − r (0) =

p (0)

m Z t

0

dτ

cos2(ωτ )

(40)

The integral can be readily performed and after some simpliﬁcations we ﬁ-
nally obtain

r (t) = cos ωt r (0) +

1
mω

sin ωt p (0) .

(41)

10

Therefore we have obtained the solution of the time-independent harmonic
oscillator in an alternative way from the knowledge of the initial conditions
as it should be. Notice that the general solution A(t) = A (0) cos (ωt + θ)
would lead to the same general result. Another possible solution in the case
of the time-independent isotropic harmonic oscillator is given by

A (r, p, t) = ˆu · p (t) ,

(42)

as can be shown by substituting this solution into (6). This solution shows
that the trajectories have no asymptotes.

Let us now show how we can obtain the orbits in the case of the time-
dependent Kepler problem. Let us begin by rewriting (37) in polar coordi-
nates on the plane. In these coordinates the angular momentum conservation
law is written in the form

and this allows to rewrite (37) as

(47)

Equation (47) can be obtained from (46) and therefore it is redundant. In
section 4 we determined a generalized Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector for the
time-dependent Kepler problem. The scalar function A (r, p, t) associated
with this vector was found to be

11

A = φ(t) r · p − m

Making use of (43) we can rewrite the linear momentum as a function of θ

where α is the angle between j and the OX axis (see ﬁgure 2).
to integrate (51) we assume that the initial conditions at t = 0 are known
vector functions, i.e.

and

r(0) = r0 ;

p(0) = p0 .

In terms of polar coordinates these initial conditions are written as

(64)

Equation (64) corresponds to the usual time-independent Kepler problem
whose solution is given by (58). Equations (59) and (60) show that the
open solutions of (64) are transformed into the open solutions of (61) with
the same angular size and that closed solutions of (64) are associated with
spiraling solutions of (61). The period of the orbit of (64) is related to the
time interval that the spiraling particle takes to cross a ﬁxed straight line.
Representing this time interval by T0 we have

(65)

As an application of the above remarks suppose we are looking for the form
of the function φ which yields a circular orbit with radius R as a solution
to (61)? To ﬁnd this function we see from (61) that we have to solve the
following equation diﬀerential equation

The solution is

where φ0 is a constant and ω = q |C |

mR3 and β an arbitrary phase angle . The
constant φ0 may be chosen so that the transformed solution will be a given
ellipse as we show below. Equation (59) leads to

for arbitrary central ﬁelds

Equation (22) determines a time-dependent Kepler ﬁeld g (r, t) , where the
variables r and t are independent. If, however, we consider the orbit equa-
tion r (t) we can eliminate the time variable and deﬁne the function g (r, t (r))
which can be understood as an arbitrary function of r. For the sake of sim-
plicity we denote this function by g (r). The function φ (t) which transforms

the Kepler problem when understood as a function of r transforms the Kepler
ﬁeld in an arbitrary central ﬁeld. Let us write Eq. (22) in the form

Equation (80) permit us to determine the function φ (r) for any potential
V (r). Thus, we conclude that a central ﬁeld problem can be transformed
into a time-dependent Kepler problem. When g (r) describes the Kepler ﬁeld
the solution of (80) is φ (r) = 1. Sometimes it is convenient to perform a
second change of variables by deﬁning the transformation

As an example consider V (r) = k/r. Then the solution of (82) is simply

7 Conclusions

In this paper we have outlined a simple and eﬀective method for treating
problems related with time-dependent and time independent central force
ﬁelds. In particular we have dealt with the Kepler problem and the isotropic
harmonic oscillator ﬁelds. We have been able to rederive some known results
from an original point of view and generalize others. The central force ﬁeld
has been discussed in the literature from many points of view. The diﬃculty
in ﬁnding vector constants of motion for central ﬁelds stem from the fact that
in general orbits for these type of problem are not closed, therefore any new
ways to attack those problems are welcome.. In our method this diﬃculty is
transferred, so to speak, to the obtention for each possible central ﬁeld, which
can be time-dependent or not, of a certain scalar function of the position,
linear momentum and time. For a given central ﬁeld this scalar function is
a solution of (6). In the general case, the obtention of the scalar function is
a diﬃcult task. Judicious guesses, however, facilitate the search for solution
of (6) and this is what we have done here.

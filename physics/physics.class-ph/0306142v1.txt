Abstract

We reexamine the problem of having nonconservative equations of mo-
tion arise from the use of a variational principle. In particular, a formalism
is developed that allows the inclusion of fractional derivatives. This is done
within the Lagrangian framework by treating the action as a Volterra series.
It is then possible to derive two equations of motion, one of these is an
advanced equation and the other is retarded.

1 Introduction

The problem of having a dissipation term ˙q arise in the equations of motion for
a system has a long history. Bauer [2] showed that “the equations of motion of
a dissipative linear dynamical system with constant coefﬁcients are not given by
a variational principle”. There are loopholes in Bauer’s proof, however. One of
these is to allow for additional equations of motion to arise. This method was

employed by Bateman [1]. He used the Lagrangian

L = m ˙x ˙y +

(x ˙y − ˙xy)

C
2

which gives the equations of motion

m¨x + C ˙x = 0 m¨y − C ˙y = 0

Bateman’s method is not very general, so we look for other methods to model
nonconservative systems.

Caldeira and Leggett [6] suggest recognizing that a dissipative system is cou-
pled to an environment. The environment is modelled as a collection of harmonic
oscillators which results in the Lagrangian

where q is the system’s coordinate and the qn’s are the environment’s coordinates.
While the system by itself is nonconservative, the system plus environment is con-
servative. This procedure does allow the introduction of very general dissipation
terms into the system’s equation of motion. However, the microscopic modelling
of the environment makes (3) much more complex than, say, (1).

In order to overcome the difﬁculties of the above two procedures, Riewe
examined using fractional derivatives in the Lagrangians [12, 13]. This method
takes advantage of another loophole in Bauer’s proof. Namely, Bauer assumed
that all derivatives were integer ordered. Riewe’s method has the advantage of
not introducing extra coordinates as in (1) and (3). However, it ultimately results
in noncausal equations of motion. A rather ad hoc procedure of replacing anti-
causal with causal operators needs to be used at the end in order to arrive at causal
equations of motion. We will present a method that can be used within Riewe’s
formalism that avoids this situation.

We propose here a new method of using a variational principle to derive
nonconservative equations of motion. Our method is closely related to Riewe’s in
that we use fractional operators. However, we treat these operators as kernels in a
Volterra series. We show that Riewe’s formalism can be derived by using certain
types of symmetric kernels in the series expansion. A simple modiﬁcation of the
kernels will result in two equations of motion for a system. One of these equations
is advanced while the other is retarded, similar to (2).

Our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review fractional integration
and differentiation. Riewe’s formalism is brieﬂy examined in Section 3. We then
give a brief overview of Volterra series in Section 4 before examining our fractional
Lagrangian mechanics in Section 5. Section 6 examines the nonconservative
harmonic oscillator in a different way than the traditional variational methods. A
discussion of some related concepts and future research follows in Section 7.

2 Fractional Integration and Differentiation

Fractional integrals and derivatives are generalizations of their usual integer or-
dered operations. To start developing the theory, let us ﬁrst write down Cauchy’s
integral formula

f (−n)(t) =

f (τ )(t − τ )n−1dτ

t

1
Γ(n) Z

a

where n > 0 is an integer, Γ(n) is the gamma function, and a < t. Equation (4) is
a convolution of f (t) and the function

Φ+

n (t)

:=

1

Γ(n) tn−1
0

t > 0
t ≤ 0

(

if we set f (t) ≡ 0 for t < a. So we can rewrite (4) as

aIn

t [f ] = f (t) ∗ Φ+

n (t)

where ∗ is the convolution operation deﬁned by

g(t) ∗ h(t)

:=

g(τ )h(t − τ )dτ

Z
Equation (6) will be our stepping stone to generalizing the integer ordered opera-
tions to fractional order.

The above procedure works so well for the integers n > 0, we want to consider

extending it to any real α > 0. This is obviously possible, so we let

aIα

t [f ] = f (t) ∗ Φ+

α (t)

−∞

(8)

be the left fractional integral [LFI] of f (t) of order α > 0. Everything works ﬁne
until we consider the case α = 0. We reasonably expect that

aI0

t [f ] = f (t)

(9)

but, it is not immediately obvious that the integral in (6) is not divergent. Also, for
−1 < α < 0, the integral is obviously divergent. It is apparent that treating f (t)
and Φ+
α (t) as regular functions will not be sufﬁciently general for our purposes.
Instead we will consider them to be distributions, or generalized functions. [We
note that there are other ways to generalize integer ordered derivatives to frac-
tional order [10]. We will work solely with the generalized function approach to
interpolate between the integer ordered integrals and derivatives.]

The ﬁrst order of business is to deﬁne the convolution operation for distribu-

tions. Let k(t) = g(t) ∗ h(t) and ϕ(t) be a test function. Then [7]

hk, ϕi

:=

k(t)ϕ(t)dt

=

Z

Z (cid:26)Z

Z Z

g(ξ)h(t − ξ)dξ

ϕ(t)dt

(10)

(cid:27)

g(ξ)h(η)ϕ(ξ + η)dξdη

Equation (10) is meaningful as long as either g(t) or h(t) has bounded support or,
g(t) and h(t) are bounded on the same side [e.g., g(t) ≡ 0 for t < t1 and h(t) ≡ 0
for t < t2]. We will always assume that one of these situations is the case. From
(10), it can be seen that the generalization of (7) is

hg ∗ h, ϕi = hg(t), hh(τ ), ϕ(t + τ )ii

The convolution operation has the properties

g ∗ h = h ∗ g
f ∗ (g ∗ h) = (f ∗ g) ∗ h

D(g ∗ h) = (Dg) ∗ h = g ∗ (Dh)

(11)

(12)
(13)
(14)

where D(·) is the generalized derivative. Remember that the relationship between
the generalized and classical derivatives, beginning at t = a, is given by [10]

Dnf = f (n) +

Dn−k−1δ(t − a)

f (k)(a)

(15)

n−1

Xk=0 h

i

where f (n) is the classical derivative.

Considering Φ+

α (t) as a generalized function allows us to extend (8) to any α,
where the convolution operation is deﬁned as in (11). For α < 0, this will deﬁne
the left fractional derivative [LFD] as

aD−α

t

[f ]

t [f ]

:= aIα
= f (t) ∗ Φ+

α (t)

In the sequel, we will ﬁnd it easier to assume α > 0 and use the notation

aDα

t [f ] = f (t) ∗ Φ+

−α(t)

aD−α

t

[f ] = aIα

t [f ]

Also, for reasons that will become apparent shortly, we will often set f (t) ≡ 0 for
t < a and t > b, where a < b. We do not want any resulting discontinuities in
f (t) at t = b to affect the LFDs. So t must be restricted to the interval a ≤ t < b
in the LFDs. It would perhaps be better to write (17) as

a− Dα

t− [f ] =

1
Γ(−α) Z

t−

a−

f (τ )(t − τ )−(α+1)dτ

(18)

To avoid cluttering our notation, we will continue to use the notation in (17) with
the understanding that it formally means (18).

The distributions Φ+

α (t) have been well studied [7, 10]. Their two most

important properties are

n (t) = D−nδ(t+)
Φ+

for any integer n, and, for any β and γ,
β (t − a) ∗ Φ+

Φ+

γ (t) = Φ+

β+γ(t − a)

Equation (20) implies

Now let 0 ≤ n − 1 ≤ α < n. Then, using (12) – (14) and (19) and (20), we

Equations (23) and (24) are the distributional forms of the Caputo and Riemann-
Liouville fractional derivative, respectively [10].
In the standard deﬁnitions of
these derivatives, Dn is replaced with (d/dt)n.

In addition to the left fractional operations, we can also deﬁne right fractional

operations. If we set f (t) ≡ 0 for t > b and deﬁne

Φ−

α (t)

:=

1

Γ(α) (−t)α−1
0

t < 0
t ≥ 0

(

the right fractional operations are deﬁned by

tDα

b [f ]

:= f (t) ∗ Φ−

−α(t)

Most of the above observations for the left fractional operations also hold for the
right ones. However, (19) needs to be replaced with

n (t) = (−1)nD−nδ(t−)
Φ−

for any integer n. When f (t) ≡ 0 for t < a and t > b, we do not allow any
resulting discontinuities in f (t) at t = a to affect the RFDs. Similar to the case
for the LFDs, we will take (26) as meaning

t+ Dα

b+ [f ] =

b+

1
Γ(−α) Z

t+

f (τ )(τ − t)−(α+1)

(28)

though we will continue to use the notation in (26).

Note that for the left operations, the “left” integration limit a determines the
allowable functions in the operation aDα
t [f ]. Namely, f (t) must vanish for t < a.
Also, aDα
t [f ] is a function of α and t and, a functional of f (t). Similar comments
hold for the right operations. Here, the “right” integration limit b means f (t) ≡ 0
for t > b. Now let f (t) be compactly supported on the interval [a, b]. Then
aDα
t [f ] does not generally vanish for
t > a. Thus, the left operations are causal or retarded. Conversely, tDα
b [f ] = 0
whenever t > b but, generally, tDα
b [f ] 6= 0 for t < b. Hence, the right operations
are anti-causal or advanced.

t [f ] = 0 whenever t < a. However, a Dα

Our fractional derivatives satisfy an integration by parts formula. First, assume

that f (t) ≡ 0 for t < a and g(t) ≡ 0 for t > b. Then, for any β,

hg(τ )Φ+

β (τ − t)f (t), ϕ(t, τ )i = hg(τ )Φ−

We note that Riewe’s derivation of an integration by parts formula [13, Equa-
tion (16)] is ﬂawed on two points. First, the boundary conditions are generally
fractional, not integer, ordered. Also, Riewe incorrectly exchanges the classical
Caputo derivative [(23) with Dn replaced with (d/dt)n] for the Riemann-Liouville
derivative in (24). Fortunately, when vanishing boundary conditions are assumed,
these defects are inconsequential. Also notice that (31) implies that any integration
by parts inherently introduces time reversal.

When we examine Riewe’s fractional mechanics in Section 3, (31) will lead to

equations of the form

The difﬁculty with (32) is that neither are Φ+
β (t) compactly supported,
generally, nor are they bounded on the same side. So we need to make sense of
the convolution in (32). To give meaning to the convolution, let us note that the

Some care is needed when using the FFDs. Formally we have set f (t) ≡ 0 for
t > a and t < b. However, the LFD only acts on the resulting discontinuities that
may be present in f (t) at t = a, not at t = b. Conversely, the RFD acts on the
discontinuities at t = b, not t = a. It is perhaps better to write (37) as

In general, the fractional derivatives are nonlocal in time. That is, they have
a “memory”. For integer ordered LFDs and RFDs, this memory disappears [i.e.,
they are “amnesiac”] and they act locally in time. Even integer ordered FFDs are
also amnesiac since the kernels Ψ−2n(t) equal, up to a sign, Φ+
−2n(t)
in this case. All of the fractional derivatives have a fading memory, however [4].
That is, they are affected more by the recent past and/or future than the distant past
and/or future.

Hamilton’s principle states that the actual path that a system follows will be that

(52)

Notice the appearance of the FFD in (51). It arises because of the integration
by parts formula (31). In order to have a strictly causal equation of motion, Riewe
suggests considering an inﬁnitesimal time interval [0, 2ǫ] and then replacing all
RFDs with LFDs. This seems unsatisfactory because fractional operators have
memory due to their nonlocal [in time] nature. By restricting the time interval
to an inﬁnitesimal duration, Riewe is effectively erasing this memory. Also, it is
questionable if this will provide an accurate approximation. For example, let our
time period be [0, 2ǫ] and

f (t) = δ(t − ǫ)
= Φ+

Now let α = 1/2. Obviously (54) and (55) do not agree for t < ǫ. For t > ǫ we
have that Ψ−1(t − ǫ) 6= 0 while Φ+

−1(t − ǫ) does vanish.

If we blindly follow the above procedure for (51) we have the resulting equation

m¨q + C ˙q =

∂q

m¨q + C ˙q = −

which is missing a minus sign in front of the derivative of the potential V . We
b[q] = −¨q for a < t < b and change the sign of
could of course recognize that a
C in (44). Then we would have the correct causal equation of motion with friction

However, this requires that we treat integer ordered derivatives differently, which
is not entirely satisfactory.

respectively, for a < t < b.

Comparing (64) and (65) with (2), we see that Bateman’s method is included
in Riewe’s formalism provided we use Lagrangians as in (58) and, require the
advanced and retarded parts of the perturbed action to vanish separately. [These
types of Lagrangians were not considered explicitly by Riewe in [12, 13].] Al-
lowing both a retarded and an advanced equation of motion to arise from the
variation of the action seems more natural than, for example, (52). It avoids the
ﬁnal procedure of replacing tDα
b [q] with aDα
t [q]. Also, the Lagrangian in (58)
is preferable to that in (44) because it does not apriori assume that the LFDs are
to be favored over the RFDs. Now we turn our attention to an alternate way of
constructing nonconservative Lagrangians.

4 Volterra Series

In order to develop our new formalism of nonconservative Lagrangians, we will
need some background on Volterra series [5, 15]. The Volterra series is a general-
ization to functionals of the power series of a function. For some functional V[q],
we deﬁne the symmetric kernels

K (s)

n (τ1, . . . , τn)

:=

δnV[q]
δq(τ1) · · · δq(τn)

(66)

12

n (·)’s are symmetric under an interchange of the τi’s. So, for example,

The K (s)

2 (τ1, τ2) = K (s)

2 (τ2, τ1). Introducing the notation

The symmetric kernels are the natural choice to use in a Volterra series. How-
ever, we may be given asymmetric kernels and would like to symmetrize them or
vice versa. As motivation, consider the function

5 Volterra Series Fractional Lagrangian Mechanics

Let us now reconsider the nonconservative harmonic oscillator equation of motion
in (52). Using the notation in (69), (52) becomes

K (s)

2 (t, τ )

:= mΨ−2(t − τ ) + CΨ−2α(t − τ ) − mω2Ψ0(t − τ )

(75)

Let our action be given by

K (s)

2 ⋆ q1 = 0

V2[q] =

K (s)

2 ⋆ q2

δV2[q]
δq(t)

= K (s)

Requiring (77) to vanish gives us (74).

Suppose now that we have a driven harmonic oscillator

m¨q + mω2q = f (t)

We can form a new functional

V2

′ [q] = K (s)

Then,

where

It immediately follows that, ignoring boundary conditions,

′ [q]

δq(t)

= K (s)

Requiring (81) to vanish and comparing with (78), we see that K (s)
′ (t) = f (t).

where, for some constant C,

We recognize (82) as the beginning of the Volterra series for some functional V[q].
To all orders of q,

V[q] =

K (s)

n ⋆ qn

∞

n=1

n!

[We can ignore the n = 0 term in (85) since this only adds an irrelevant constant
to V[q].] For n ≥ 2, the K (s)
n (·)’s are interpreted as the environment’s reaction to
q, which affects q’s evolution. Any forcing function is included in K (s)

1 (t).

All of the actions considered above share two key properties:

1. The kernels K (s)

n (·) are all localized along the line τ1 = τ2.

2. The kernels satisfy the relation K (s)

n (·) = K (t)

n (·).

These properties make the above actions particularly easy to analyze. However, it
is impossible to introduce even the simple term C ˙q into the equations of motion
using the Ψα’s [see (41)]. Using triangular, instead of symmetric, kernels results
in a more ﬂexible formalism. This amounts to using the Φ±
α ’s in the Volterra series
instead of the Ψα’s. We will then be able to construct symmetric kernels that only
use the Φ±
α ’s, not the Ψα’s. This requires us to be careful about the boundary terms
in our equations. It is this situation that we now turn our attention to.

We return again to the nonconservative harmonic oscillator. For some constant

Note that if our kernels only contain terms Φ±

2n, n an integer, requiring the
advanced and retarded parts to vanish separately is equivalent to requiring the sum
in (90) to vanish, ignoring boundary conditions. This is because Φ+
2n and
both equal, up to a sign, Ψ2n. So in this case we can freely use the symmetric
kernels Ψ2n in our action. We can also extend the above action to a driven harmonic
oscillator and higher order potentials, as we did earlier. Again, this is due to the

similar to that in (90) shows that, if we use (93) for our action , then q(τ1) ≡ 0 for
τ1 < a and q(τ2) ≡ 0 for τ2 > b. It follows that the symmetric action

Thus,
V[q] differs from S[q] only by the boundary terms of q(t), which, by our
above analysis, does not affect the resulting equation of motion. This also holds
for (96) and (97). Returning to (95), let us perturb q(t) by η(t). Then,

The second term on the right of (101) is what we typically want in order to derive
our equation of motion for q(t). However, the ﬁrst term on the right of (101) is
interesting. It shows that the advanced equation of motion for q(t) arises because
of the perturbation of the environment’s reaction due to η(t). That is, using (30),

So it seems that the future evolution of q(t) is affected by its past evolution because
of the memory “stored” in the environment.

6 Perturbing the Environment

So far we have examined everything in a fairly standard way. We assumed that
the environment is described by K +
2 (t) := K +
2 (t, 0) [see (86)] and introduced a
particle into this environment via q(t). Then we perturbed the particle’s path and
required that the variation in the action vanish under this perturbation. Notice
that the particle did not change the environment’s kernel given by K +
2 (t). So
the particle itself must be so negligible that the environment’s kernel does not
substantially change under its introduction. That is, the particle is a perturbation
to the environment. Let us explore this idea more for the nonconservative harmonic
oscillator. This will lead to a more holistic view of mechanics which ignores the
distinction between the environment and the system, in the case of the harmonic
oscillator.

18

Let us assume that the environment is adequately described by the generalized

function [see (20) for the second equality below]

Requiring (104) to vanish gives us exactly (91) when we identify

η(t) ≡ q(t).

2 (t) := K −

In (103), we assumed that the environment reacts causally to any perturbation.
This resulted in the retarded equation of motion in (104). If, instead, we considered
the kernel K −
2 (0, t), [see (87)], then the advanced equation of motion in
(92) would have resulted instead of (104). So, we see that it is not necessary, for the
nonconservative harmonic oscillator, to construct an action in order to derive the
equations of motion. How far this idea can be advanced to more general systems
is an open question.

7 Discussion

Let us look at the retarded equation in (91) a little. This is a convolution between
the coordinate q(t) and the distribution K +
2 (t). An insightful way of
viewing this is to think of K +
2 (t) as the environment’s response “function”, where,
for an arbitrary f (t),

2 (t, 0) := K +

y(t) = K +

2 (t) ∗ f (t)

(105)

Then, the actual paths that a system can follow will be those f (t) such that y(t) ≡ 0
in (105). That is, the path a system follows will be those such that the environment’s
response to it vanishes. This treatment of fractional derivatives as signal processors
is well known [14] and can be extended to more general Volterra series than that

19

in (91) [4, 9]. Similar comments hold for (92) and its generalizations, but, in this
case, the environment’s response is anti-causal. We have not pursued this line of
research here. However, it does open up the possibility of examining mechanics
from a systems theoretic viewpoint [see, e.g., [8] for an introduction to systems
theory].

We have not considered the most general action here. Instead, our attention
was restricted to including fractional derivatives in an equation of motion derived
by using a variational principle.
In this respect we have succeeded. Further
research is needed to see how far our formalism can be developed and, how useful
it will be in situations other than those considered here. In particular, it would be
interesting to extend the formalism in Section 6 to more general situations.

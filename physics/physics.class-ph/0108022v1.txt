We present a novel method for detecting nonlinearities, due to quantum electrodynamics through
photon–photon scattering, in Maxwell’s equation. The photon–photon scattering gives rise to self-
interaction terms, which are similar to the nonlinearities due to the polarisation in nonlinear optics.
These self-interaction terms vanish in the limit of parallel propagating waves, but if instead of
parallel propagating waves the modes generated in wavesguides are used, there will be a non-zero
total eﬀect. Based on this idea, we calculate the nonlinear excitation of new modes and estimate
the strength of this eﬀect. Furthermore, we suggest a principal experimental setup.

PACS number(s): 12.20.Ds, 42.50.Vk

According to QED, the non-classical phenomenon of photon–photon scattering can take place due to the exchange
of virtual electron–positron pairs. This is a second order eﬀect (in terms of the ﬁne structure constant α ≡ e2/2ε0hc ≈
1/137), and it can in standard notation be formulated in terms of the Euler–Heisenberg Lagrangian density [1,2]

L = ε0F + ξ(4F 2 + 7G 2) ,

F ≡ 1
velocity of light, h the Planck constant and me the electron mass. We note that F = G = 0 in the limit of parallel
propagating waves. The latter terms in (1) represent the eﬀects of vacuum polarisation and magnetisation, and the
QED corrected Maxwell’s vacuum equations take the classical form using

ξ ≡

where P and M are of third order in the ﬁeld amplitudes E and B, and µ0 = 1/c2ε0. Furthermore, they contain
terms F and G such that P = M = 0 in the limit of parallel propagating waves.
It is therefore necessary to
use other waves in order to obtain an eﬀect from these QED corrections. Several attempts have been presented in
the literature over the years [3–8], where Refs. [3–6] mainly focused on principal issues, whereas the experimental
possibilities for detection have been discussed in [7,8]. Soljacic & Segev concluded that, using their mechanism [7],
the detection of the QED nonlinearities will be technologically viable within ten to ﬁfteen years, provided that the
laser power increases steadily. In this work we suggest the use of waveguides as an experimental setup, something
which, as far as the authors know, has not been discussed previously for this purpose. The idea of using a waveguide
is to achieve a resonant coupling between the parallel propagating waves of diﬀerent frequencies. We calculate the
generated electromagnetic ﬁeld for a rectangular waveguide, using the TE01- and TE10-modes as pump waves. In the
proposal for the experimental setup, the waveguide is replaced by a cavity, in order to prevent the convective loss
of energy, and thereby maximise the saturated amplitude of the excited mode. The saturation level due to a ﬁnite
conductivity of the cavity walls is estimated. We ﬁnd that the excited mode can be detected even for moderate levels
of the pump mode amplitudes, i.e. for ﬁeld strengths that can be supported by the cavity walls.

In a medium with polarisation P and magnetisation M the general wave equations for E and B are

Next we consider propagation in a rectangular waveguide with dimensions x0 and y0 (i.e. the region 0 ≤ x ≤ x0,
0 ≤ y ≤ y0 is vacuum surrounded by walls that, as a starting point, are assumed to be perfectly conducting.). We
assume that the TE10- and TE01-modes act as pump waves with distinct frequencies. To lowest order (i.e. neglecting
the vacuum nonlinearities) the ﬁelds are

0 for the TE01-mode, where c.c. stands for complex conjugate. Here we have
denoted the wave amplitudes, which to lowest order are constants, by
Bz2, respectively. Substituting the
Bz1 and
linear expression for the ﬁelds into the cubic nonlinear terms, we note that there will be perturbations with frequency
and wavenumber (ω3, k3), where the possible combinations are (ω3, k3) = (ω1, k1) , (ω2, k2) , (2ω1 ± ω2, 2k1 ±
k2) , and (2ω2 ± ω1, 2k2 ± k1). If there is a small perturbation (e.g. of the order of 10−15) of the amplitude of any of
the original TE-modes, it would probably be a too diﬃcult task to measure such an eﬀect, whereas the appearance
of a distinctly new frequency, although with small amplitude, will be easier to detect. We therefore concentrate on
the two latter combinations, which are physically equivalent. Furthermore, if any of these combinations satisﬁes the
dispersion relation for a natural mode of the waveguide, the amplitude of this resonantly driven mode will be much
larger than the others. We therefore, for deﬁniteness, choose to consider the matching condition

(ω3, k3) = (2ω1 − ω2, 2k1 − k2) ,

(6)

where the dimensions of the waveguide are assumed to be chosen such as to make (ω3, k3) a natural mode of the
waveguide.

Using the pump modes (4) and (5), we can get source terms in the wave equations either for a TE01-mode or for
a TM01-mode. For the latter case, however, the frequency matching conditions and dispersions relations cannot be
fulﬁlled simultaneously for real values of all wavenumbers, and thus we consider the excitation of a TE01-mode, i.e.
we let

Thus, using Eqs. (4) and (5), we can evaluate the source terms in Eqs. (2) and (3). For a waveguide of ﬁnite length
fulﬁlling the boundary condition of no incoming wave with frequency ω3 at the waveguide starting point z = 0, we
then have spatial growth. The ansatz B3z =

B3z(z) exp[i(k3z − ω3t)] + c.c. in (3) thus gives a linear spatial growth

When designing parameters for an experiment, it might be tempting to choose parameters such that the dispersion
relation is fulﬁlled for k3 = 0 in which case we instead get a quadratic spatial growth of the amplitude. However, the
case k3 = 0 is not the most interesting choice for two reasons. Firstly, the group velocity of and thereby the energy
ﬂux of the excited mode is proportional to k3. Secondly it is impossible for ω3 > ω1, ω2 to hold when k3 = 0. The
reason for requiring the excited wave to have a higher frequency than the others is that we then have the possibility to
use waveguide ﬁltering (see below) in order to measure the excited wave without any disturbing signals from the pump
waves. Since k3 cannot be small as compared to 1/x0 for ω3 > ω1, ω2 to hold, the spatial growth in (7) may be too slow
for practical purposes, and we are therefore motivated to consider a cavity rather than a waveguide. Since the waves
propagating in positive and negative directions are identical in that cavity, the boundary conditions imply temporal
rather than spatial growth. If we assume that all waves have k > 0 (are propagating in the positive z-direction)
in the waveguide example, the coupling coeﬃcient in a cavity can be found from the waveguide result, simply by
noting that the positive propagating part of the standing pump waves couples to the positive propagating part of
the excited standing wave, and vice versa. Since V is a quadratic function of the wavenumbers, the same coupling
strengths apply for standing waves ∼ sin(nπz/L) exp[−iωt], where L is the length of the cavity, as for propagating
waves ∼ exp[i(kz − ωt)], if we just let the wavenumber be k = ±nπ/L where the sign corresponds to the direction
of propagation, and n is a positive integer. For design purposes we must keep in mind, however, that we now have
additional constraints relating the frequencies and dimensions since the wavenumbers cannot be chosen continously.
Bz represent the standing wave amplitude, and modify the ansatz such that the excited ampitude depends

In order to avoid problems due to the large amplitude pump signals when trying to measure the excited mode,
it is convenient to use a slightly modiﬁed cavity rather than an idealized cubic cavity. Such a cavity could consist
of two parts; one cavity (I), in which the signal is generated, attached to another cavity (II), acting as a waveguide
ﬁlter. The dimensions of cavity I should be chosen such as to keep the frequency of the excited mode above cut-oﬀ in
cavity II, whereas the pump modes should be below cut-oﬀ. By measuring the excited signal far enough into cavity
II (in practice 30-40 pump decay lengths), the pump waves eﬀectively vanish, and we can forget about the disturbing
inﬂuence of the pump waves. However, note that a certain ﬁne tuning of the length of cavity II might be necessary
to keep a maximally eﬃcient phase relation between the excited eigenmode and the pump waves in cavity I.

Next we demonstrate that the experimental model setup gives signals that can be detected with presently available
technology. High performance, i.e. large electromagnetic ﬁelds combined with low dissipative losses, can be found
in superconducting cavities, which among other things are used for particle accelerator purposes [9]. Adopting data
from these experiments, we assume that the pump waves have a ﬁeld-strength Ecrit ∼ 30 MV/m, i.e. close to the
maximum that can be tolerated by the walls without ﬁeld emissions. For a cavity resistance R ∼ 1 nΩ, corresponding
to superconducting niobium at a temperature 1.4 K and a frequency ω3 ∼ 2 × 1010 rad/s, we ﬁnd from Eq. (8) that
the saturated energy ﬂux P3 of mode 3 is of the order of P3 ∼ 10−6 W/m2. Here we have used the simple order of

magnitude estimate that all wavelengths are comparable to the dimensions x0 and y0 when evaluating V . Clearly
this energy ﬂux is above the detection level by several orders of magnitude. Note, however, the importance of the
superconducting walls for the output level of the excited mode. For copper at room temperature, the cavity resistance
increases by a factor ∼ 10−7 as compared to the above example, and consequently the energy ﬂux of the excited mode
falls by a factor ∼ 10−14. In this latter case it is questionable whether the excited signal can be detected.

To our knowledge, it has not been possible to verify the Euler–Heisenberg Lagrangian density experimentally.
The above calculation of the QED mode coupling strength and the subsequent estimations suggest that it can be
very suitable to use two pump modes in a superconducting cavity for this purpose. The parameters of the problem
should be designed such as to simultaneously fulﬁll the dispersion relations of each mode together with the matching
condition (6). Naturally, care must be taken when drawing the conclusions, since there are certain eﬀects that we have
not yet addressed. For example, in the present model the conductivity of the walls is linear, but in principle there
might be a nonlinear contribution to the conductivity that could give rise to a small signal at the same frequency
as the QED contribution. On the other hand, to our knowledge, there are no theoretical or experimental reports of
such eﬀects. Secondly, in reality the vacuum in the waveguide will not be perfect, and in principle this may lead to
dielectric breakdown for the pump ﬁeld strength considered in the above estimate. However, we do not expect this
particular eﬀect to be a serious threat against our proposal, since similar electric ﬁeld strengths have been reached in
present experiments [9], and the pump ﬁeld strength that is actually needed is much less than the one considered in
the estimate. Thus we conclude that it is possible that the eﬀect of photon–photon scattering in vacuum due to the
exchange of virtual electron–positron pairs can be meaured using existing technology.

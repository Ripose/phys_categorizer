An assessment of Evans’ uniﬁed ﬁeld theory II

Abstract

Evans developed a classical uniﬁed ﬁeld theory of gravitation and elec-
tromagnetism on the background of a spacetime obeying a Riemann-Cartan
geometry. In an accompanying paper I, we analyzed this theory and summa-
rized it in nine equations. We now propose a variational principle for Evans’
theory and show that it yields two ﬁeld equations. The second ﬁeld equation
is algebraic in the torsion and we can resolve it with respect to the torsion.
It turns out that for all physical cases the torsion vanishes and the ﬁrst ﬁeld
equation, together with Evans’ uniﬁed ﬁeld theory, collapses to an ordinary
Einstein equation.

1 Introduction

In an accompanying paper [4], called I in future, we investigated the uniﬁed ﬁeld
theory of Evans [1, 2]. We take the notation and the conventions from I, where
also more references to Evans’ work can be found. We assume that the reader is
familiar with the main content of part I before she or he turns her or his attention to
the present paper. In I we were able to reduce Evans’ theory to just nine equations,
which we will list again for convenience.

Spacetime obeys in Evans’ theory a Riemann-Cartan geometry (RC-geometry)
that can be described by an orthonormal coframe ϑα, a metric gαβ = diag(+1, −1,
−1, −1), and a Lorentz connection Γαβ = −Γβα. In terms of these quantities, we
can deﬁne torsion and curvature, respectively:

T α := Dϑα ,
Rα

:= dΓα

β

β − Γα

γ ∧ Γγ

β .

The Bianchi identities and their contractions follow therefrom.

Evans proposes an extended electromagnetic ﬁeld with the potential Aα. By

Evans’ ansatz, this potential is postulated to be proportional to the coframe

Aα = a0 ϑα ,

F α := DAα .

with some constant a0. The electromagnetic ﬁeld strength is deﬁned according to

The extended homogeneous and inhomogeneous Maxwell equations read in

Lorentz covariant form

DF α = Rβ

α ∧ Aβ

and

D⋆F α = ⋆Rβ

α ∧ Aβ ,

respectively. Alternatively, with Lorentz non-covariant sources and with partial
substitution of (3) and (4), they can be rewritten as

J α

hom ,

hom :=

dF α = Ω0 J α

In the gravitational sector of Evans’ theory, the Einstein-Cartan theory of grav-
ity (EC-theory) was adopted by Evans. Thus, the ﬁeld equations are those of

Here ηαβγ = ⋆(ϑα ∧ ϑβ ∧ ϑγ). The total energy-momentum of matter plus elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld is denoted by Σα, the corresponding total spin by ταβ.

This is the set-up. What we will do here is to propose a new variational prin-
ciple that describes Evans’ theory. We will derive the ﬁeld equations and will
discuss their properties.

2 Closing loopholes in Evans’ theory

It is apparent that there exist a couple of loopholes in Evans’ theory. Apart from
announcing the second ﬁeld equation (9) only verbally and without specifying any
formula, the right-hand sides of the two ﬁeld equations are left open in Evans’
approach. How is the energy-momentum Σelmg
of Evans’ ﬁeld deﬁned, how the
α
spin τ elmg
αβ ? Silence is the only answer in Evans’ verbose publications. In order to
have a better grip on Evans’ theory, we decided to develop it a bit further.

From the summary of Evans’ theory it becomes clear that the geometrical
equations (1),(2) and the gravitational equations (8),(9) represent the viable EC-
theory of gravitation that is distinct from general relativity by an additional spin-
spin contact interaction which only acts at very high matter densities, see the
review [5]. If the sources in the framework of the EC-theory are the Maxwell ﬁeld
A (with F = dA) and some matter ﬁelds Ψ, we have the variational principle

LEC = −

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(10)

The matter ﬁelds Ψ are supposed to be minimally coupled to gravity and to elec-
tromagnetism. Variation with respect to A yields the inhomogeneous Maxwell
equation d ⋆F = Ω0 J, with J = δLmat/δA, variation with respect to ϑα and
Γαβ the gravitational ﬁeld equations (8) and (9), with Σelmg
substituted
by ΣMaxw
, respectively. This is conventional wisdom. Thereby, we
α
also ﬁnd the canonical energy-momentum and the spin angular momentum of the

δLMaxw

:= −

δLMaxw
δΓαβ = 0 .

However, in Evans’ theory, instead of the Maxwell ﬁeld, we have Evans’ ex-
tended electromagnetic ﬁeld. Then the questions arise what the sources on the
right-hand-sides of the gravitational ﬁeld equations (8) and (9) are and what the
extended electromagnetic ﬁeld may contribute to them. For the time being, we
forget Evans’ ansatz, that is, we develop a ﬁeld theoretical model before Evans’
ansatz (3) is substituted.

2.1 Auxiliary Lagrangian

We proceed like in Maxwell’s theory. We pick Evans’ Aα potential as the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld variable and deﬁne the ﬁeld strength F a = DAα. Then DF α =
DDAα = Rβ
α ∧ Aβ is the homogeneous equation (5)1. For the inhomogeneous
ﬁeld equation, we propose the auxiliary Lagrangian 4-form

L = −

Fα ∧ ⋆F α + ⋆Rαβ ∧ Aα ∧ Aβ

.

(cid:1)

1
2Ω0 (cid:0)

This is the Lagrangian for a massless Lorentz vector valued 1-form ﬁeld that is
non-minimally coupled to the curvature. Variation with respect to Aα yields

D ⋆F α = ⋆Rβ

α ∧ Aβ ,

which coincides with (5)2. Note that the Lagrangian (13), if Evans’ ansatz is
substituted, is similar in structure as the improved Evans Lagrangian I, Eq.(77).
However, (13) is a pure electromagnetical Lagrangian whereas I, Eq.(77) is purely
gravitational.

2.2 Energy-momentum

Having recovered the (unsubstituted) electromagnetic ﬁeld equations, we turn to
the energy question. In the EC-theory, we get the energy-momentum by varying
the Lagrangian with respect to the coframe:

Σelmg
α

:= −

δL
δϑα =

1
2Ω0 (cid:2)
+(Aβ ∧ Aγ) ∧

F β ∧ (eα⌋⋆Fβ) − ⋆F β ∧ (eα⌋Fβ)

eα⌋⋆Rβγ

− ⋆(Aβ ∧ Aγ) ∧ (eα⌋Rβγ)

.

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(cid:3)

(cid:0)
4

(cid:1)

Here we need the master formula of [8] for the commutator of a variation δ with
the Hodge star operator ⋆. The energy-momentum is still tracefree as in Maxwell’s
theory,

ϑα ∧ Σelmg

α = 0 ,

since Aα is a massless ﬁeld, and, perhaps surprisingly, the energy-momentum
remains symmetric,

ϑ[α∧Σelmg

β] =

1
2Ω0

(cid:2)(cid:0)

(cid:1)

ϑ[α∧

eβ]⌋⋆Rγδ

∧ (Aγ ∧ Aδ) − (eβ]⌋Rγδ) ∧ ⋆(Aγ ∧ Aδ)

= 0,

as some algebra1 shows, compare [6], Eqs.(B.5.20) and (E.1.27).

We substitute Evans’ ansatz (3) and ﬁnd

(cid:3)

(18)

(cid:0)
By some algebra, the term in the second line can be a bit simpliﬁed:

(cid:1)

(cid:3)

+ 2 ⋆Rβα ∧ ϑβ + Rβγ ∧ ηαβγ

.

(cid:3)

(19)

Also after the substitution of Evans’ ansatz the energy-momentum remains trace-
less ϑα ∧ Σelmg

α = 0 and symmetric ϑ[α ∧ Σelmg

β] = 0.

2.3 Spin angular momentum

Now we turn to spin angular momentum. Since the extended electromagnetic
potential Aα transforms as a vector under Lorentz transformations, it carries spin,
as any other Lorentz vector ﬁeld. Again we ﬁnd no help in Evans’ work. We vary
the Lagrangian (13) with respect to the connection:

τ elmg
αβ

:= −

δL
δΓαβ =

Ω0 (cid:20)

A[α ∧ ⋆Fβ] +

D ⋆(Aα ∧ Aβ)

(20)

.

(cid:21)

1Let Φ be an arbitrary p-form in a 4-dimensions RC-space with Lorentzian signature. Af-
ter applying the formula ⋆(Φ ∧ ϑα) = eα⌋ ⋆Φ twice, it can be shown that ϑ[α ∧ eβ]⌋ ⋆Φ =
⋆

ϑ[α ∧ eβ]⌋Φ
(cid:0)

.
(cid:1)

(21)

(23)

(24)

If we substitute Evans’ ansatz (3), we get

τ elmg

ηαβγ ∧ T γ

Now we apply the exterior covariant derivative to (20):

}

After using the inhomogeneous ﬁeld equation and the Ricci identity, we ﬁnd



Dτ elmg

αβ = 0 .

Thus, the spin of the ﬁeld Aα, without contribution of the Aα-ﬁeld’s orbital angu-
lar momentum, is covariantly conserved. As we see from (17) and (23), angular
momentum conservation for the vacuum case is fulﬁlled:

Dτ elmg

αβ + ϑ[α ∧ Σelmg

β] = 0 .

3 A new variational principle for gravity and ex-

tended electromagnetism

Evans’ theory is distinguished from the foregoing system by the new ansatz (3)
for electromagnetism. Thus, instead of the Maxwell Lagrangian, as in (10), we
have to take the new Lagrangian (13) describing the Evans ﬁeld Aα. Adding a
Lagrange multiplier piece that enforces Evans’ ansatz, we ﬁnd

L = −

⋆(ϑα ∧ ϑβ) ∧ Rαβ −

(cid:0)

1
2Ω0 (cid:0)
+ λα ∧ (Aα − a0 ϑα) .

(cid:1)

(25)

(cid:1)
The Lagrange multiplier is a covector-valued 3-form with 16 independent compo-
nents. The conserved currents of this model Lagrangian can be derived with the
help of the general formalism as developed, e.g., by Obukhov and Rubilar [10].

Let us ﬁrst discuss the situation when the Lagrange multiplier is put to zero.
Then variations with respect to Aα, ϑα, Γαβ lead to the ﬁeld equations (5)2, (8),
(9), respectively, that is, apart from Evans’ ansatz, we recover the relevant ﬁeld

6

equations in electromagnetism and gravitation as they are characteristic for Evans’
theory. Insofar the variational principle does what it is supposed to.

Now we relax the multiplier and, accordingly, have a new ﬁeld variable λα.
If we drop the matter ﬁelds, the variation of the Lagrangian (25) looks now as
follows:

δL = δAα ∧

Here Gα := 1

They arise also from the variation of the Hilbert type Lagrangian with respect to
coframe and connection. The expressions in the brackets have to vanish at the
extremum of the action.

The ﬁrst term yields the value for the multiplier

All what is left from Evans’ theory, are these 16+24 ﬁeld equations in which
the sources are speciﬁed by (19) and (21), but only 10 of the 16 are independent.
If we substitute these sources, we ﬁnd the system

Note that (32) represents partial differential equations of second order in the
coframe, because D ⋆Tα = D ⋆Dϑα, and ﬁrst order in the connection. The lin-
earized version is a wave type equation for the coframe ϑα.

4 Solution of the second ﬁeld equation

The second (Cartan’s) ﬁeld equation (33) is a homogeneous algebraic equation
for the components of the torsion. We can solve this equation exactly. For this
purpose we need the identity (for the proof, see [9], for example):

1
2

ηαβγ ∧ T γ ≡ ϑ[α ∧ hβ],

hα := ⋆(−(1)Tα + 2(2)Tα +

(3)Tα).

1
2

The right-hand side of (35) is constructed from the irreducible parts of the torsion.
Namely, let us recall that the torsion 2-form can be decomposed into the three
irreducible pieces,

T α = (1)T α + (2)T α + (3)T α,

8

(32)

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

where the vector, axial vector and pure tensor parts of the torsion are deﬁned by

ϑα ∧ (eν⌋T ν),

(2)T α =

1
3
(3)T α = −

1
3
(1)T α = T α − (2)T α − (3)T α.

⋆(ϑα ∧ ⋆(T ν ∧ ϑν)) =

1
3

eα⌋(T ν ∧ ϑν),

Substituting (34) into (33), we ﬁnd

ξ ⋆Tα + (1 + ξ) hα = 0.

Using then (35) and (36), we can ultimately recast the last equation into the form

− (1)T α + (3ξ + 2) (2)T α +

(3ξ + 1) (3)T α = 0.

(41)

1
2

The irreducible parts are all algebraically independent. Hence we can conclude
that all the three terms in (41) vanish. For generic case of the coupling constant ξ
we thus ultimately ﬁnd the trivial solution:

(1)T α = (2)T α = (3)T α = 0,

hence Tα = 0.

We may have nontrivial torsion for two exceptional cases. Namely, when

ξ = −

or

ξ = −

2
3

1
3

.

However, since ξ > 0, these are unphysical cases that can be excluded.

5 Conclusions

For the generic case, we substitute the vanishing torsion solution (42) into the ﬁrst
ﬁeld equation (32) and ﬁnd that the latter reduces to the usual Einstein equation

e
where the tilde denotes the object constructed from the Riemannian (Christoffel)
connection. In this sense, the model under consideration is similar to the Einstein-
Cartan theory that also reduces to Einstein’s general relativity in absence of the
sources with spin, see [5, 13].

This similarity goes even further when the nontrivial matter sources are taken
into account. Then the right-hand side of (33) will contain the spin current 3-form
τ mat
αβ of the matter ﬁelds. Subsequently one can solve the second ﬁeld equation
(33), expressing the torsion in terms of the spin of matter. By substituting this
into (32), we can recast the ﬁrst ﬁeld equation into a form of the Einstein equa-
tion with the effective energy-momentum current that will contain the quadratic
contributions of spin. The same occurs in the Einstein-Cartan theory, too.

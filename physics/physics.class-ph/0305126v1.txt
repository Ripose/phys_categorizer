We study both linear and nonlinear surface waves localized at the interface separating a left-handed
medium (i.e. the medium with both negative dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability) and
a conventional (or right-handed) dielectric medium. We demonstrate that the interface can support
both TE- and TM-polarized surface waves–surface polaritons, and we study their properties. We
describe the intensity-dependent properties of nonlinear surface waves in three diﬀerent cases, i.e.
when both LH and RH media are nonlinear and when either of the media is nonlinear.
In the
case when both media are nonlinear, we ﬁnd two types of nonlinear surface waves, one with the
maximum amplitude at the interface, and the other one with two humps. In the case when one
medium is nonlinear, only one type of surface wave exists, which has the maximum electric ﬁeld at
the interface, unlike waves in right-handed materials where the surface-wave maximum is usually
shifted into a self-focussing nonlinear medium. We study the energy ﬂow near the surface and
demonstrate the speciﬁc vortex-like structure of temporal pulses propagating along the interface,
as well as discuss the possibility of tuning the wave group velocity in both the linear and nonlinear
cases. We show that the group-velocity dispersion, which leads to the pulse broadening, can be
balanced by nonlinearity of the media resulting in the soliton propagation.

INTRODUCTION

Novel physical eﬀects in dielectric media with both
negative permittivity and negative permeability were
ﬁrst analyzed theoretically by Veselago [1] who predicted
a number of unusual phenomena including, for exam-
ple, negative refraction of waves. Such media are usu-
ally known as left-handed (LH) media since the electric
and magnetic ﬁelds form a left set of vectors with a wave
vector. The physical realization of such LH media was
demonstrated only recently [2] for a a novel class of engi-
neered composite materials, now called LH metamateri-
als. Such LH materials attracted attention not only due
to their recent experimental realization and a number of
unusual properties observed in experiment, but also due
to the expanding debates on the use of a slab of a LH
metamaterial as a perfect lens for focusing both propa-
gating and evanescent waves [3].

The concept of a perfect lens was ﬁrst introduced by
Pendry [4], who suggested the idea that a slab of a lossless
negative-refraction material can be used for creating a
perfect image of a point source. Although the concept
of a perfect lens is a result of an ideal theoretical model
employed in the analysis [4], the resolution limit of a
LH slab was shown to be independent on the wavelength
of the electromagnetic wave (but can be determined by
other sources such as loss, spatial dispersion, etc.), so
that the resolution can be indeed much better than the
resolution of a conventional lens [5].

The improved resolution of a LH slab and the corre-
sponding ampliﬁcation of evanescent modes in a lossy LH
material, can be understood from simple physics. Indeed,
the near ﬁeld of an image, which can not be focused by
a normal lens, can be transferred through the slab of a
LH material due to the excitation of surface waves (or
surface polaritons) at both interfaces of the slab. There-
fore, as the ﬁrst major step in the understanding of the
ampliﬁed transmission of the evanescent waves, as well as
other unusual properties of the LH materials, it is impor-
tant to study the properties of diﬀerent types of surface
waves that can be excited at the interfaces between LH
and conventional (or right-handed, RH) media. Some
preliminary studies in this direction included calculation
of the linear dispersion properties of modes localized at
a single interface or in a slab of LH material [6–9].

In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the
properties of both linear and nonlinear surface waves at
the interface between semi-inﬁnite materials of two types,
left- and right-handed ones, and demonstrate a number of
unique features of surface waves in LH materials. In par-
ticular, we show the existence of surface waves of both TE
and TM polarizations, a speciﬁc feature of the RH/LH
interfaces. We suggest an eﬃcient way for engineering
of the group velocity of surface waves using the nonlin-
earity of the media. Additionally, we reveal a distinc-
tive vortex-like structure of the energy ﬂow in a localized
surface wave propagating along the interface. The dis-
persion broadening of the pulse can be compensated by

the nonlinearity, thus leading to the formation of surface-
polariton solitons at the RH/LH interfaces.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we study
the properties of surface waves in the linear regime. We
consider the most general case of an interface between
linear RH and LH media, and present a classiﬁcation of
TE- and TM-polarized surface waves localized at the in-
terface. Section III is devoted to the study of the struc-
ture and general properties of nonlinear surface waves.
We describe the intensity-dependent properties of surface
waves in three possible cases. In the ﬁrst case, we assume
that both LH and RH media are nonlinear. In the second
case, the LH medium is nonlinear, but the RH medium is
assumed to be linear. In the third case, the RH medium
is considered to be nonlinear while the LH medium re-
mains linear. In all these cases, we describe the nonlinear
medium as that with the intensity-dependent Kerr-like
dielectric permittivity. In Section IV, we study the fre-
quency dispersion of nonlinear surface waves. In partic-
ular, we demonstrate that the group velocity of surface
waves can eﬀectively be engineered by using the intensity-
dependent dispersion. A detailed analysis is carried out
for the example of nonlinear RH and linear LH media. Fi-
nally, in section V we discuss the structure of the energy
ﬂow carried by a localized wave packet of a surface-wave
mode along the interface, and we demonstrate analyti-
cally that it has a distinct vortex-like structure. We also
describe the properties of nonlinear localized modes prop-
agating along the interface, and predict the existence of
surface polariton solitons.

LINEAR SURFACE WAVES

A. Model

Linear surface waves are known to exist, under cer-
tain special conditions, at the interface separating two
diﬀerent dielectric media. In particular, the existence of
TM-polarized surface waves requires that the dielectric
constants of two dielectric materials separated by an in-
terface have diﬀerent signs, whilst for TE-polarized waves
the magnetic permeability of the materials should be of
diﬀerent signs (see, e.g. Ref. [10] and references therein).
Materials with negative ǫ are readily available (e.g., met-
als excited below a critical frequency), whilst the materi-
als with negative µ were not known until recently. This
explains why only TM-polarized surface waves have been
of interest over the last few decades.

Some preliminary studies of the properties of surface
waves excited at the interface separating a LH metamate-
rial and a dielectric have been recently reported by sev-
eral groups [6, 8, 9, 11]. Moreover, the novel concept
of a perfect lens [4] is based on the properties of sur-
face waves at the interfaces of a LH slab. This calls for
a systematic analysis of the existence and properties of
surface waves in LH materials, including the study of the
nonlinear regime and nonlinear surface waves.

In this paper, we consider an interface between the
RH (medium 1) and LH (medium 2) semi-inﬁnite me-
dia, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1. The propagation of
monochromatic waves with the frequency ω is governed
by the scalar wave equation, which for the case of the TE
waves is written for the y-component of the electric ﬁeld,

In terms of these new parameters,
the existence regions for surface waves can be deter-
mined from the condition of surface wave localization,
i.e. when the transverse wave numbers κ1,2 are real,
. Existence regions for both

}
polarizations of surface wave are presented on the param-
eter plane (X, Y ) in Fig. 1. Along with the polarization,
we denote the type of the wave, forward or backward,
which we discuss below in Sec. II C. We notice that there
exist no regions where both TE- and TM-polarized waves
co-exist simultaneously, but both types of surface wave
can be supported by the same interface for diﬀerent pa-
rameters, e.g. for diﬀerent frequencies.

{

One of the distinctive properties of the LH materials
which has been demonstrated experimentally is their spe-
ciﬁc frequency dispersion. To study the dispersion of the
corresponding surface waves, it is necessary to select a
particular form of the frequency dependence of dielec-
tric permittivity and magnetic permeability of the LH
medium. A negative dielectric permittivity is selected
in the form of the commonly used function for plasmon
investigations [10] and a negative permeability is con-
structed in an analogous form (see, e.g. Ref. [6]), i.e.

and F = 0.56. For this set of parameters, the region
of the simultaneously negative permittivity and negative

The dispersion curves of the TE-polarized surface wave
(or surface polariton) calculated with the help of Eq. (12)
are depicted in Fig. 2 on the plane of the normalized pa-
rameters ¯ω = ω/ωp and ¯h = hc/ωp. We notice that
the structure of the dispersion curves for surface waves
depends on the relation between the values of the dielec-
tric permittivities of the two media at the characteristic
frequency, ω1, at which the absolute values of magnetic
permeabilities of two media coincide, µ1 =

engineering, which we discuss below in Sec. IV.

The change of the dispersion curve from monotonically

is connected with a change in the direction of the total
power ﬂow in the wave, as discussed below.

C. Energy ﬂow near the interface

The energy ﬂow is described by the Poynting vector,
which deﬁnes the energy density ﬂux averaged over the
period T = 2π/ω, and can be written in the form

and magnetic ﬁeld of a surface wave, respectively, and the
asterisk stands for the complex conjugation.

The stationary surface wave propagating along the in-
terface has only one component of the averaged Poynting
vector,
. The energy ﬂux in the RH and LH
media is an integral of the Poynting vector over the cor-
responding semi-inﬁnite spatial region,

III. NONLINEAR SURFACE WAVES

A. Nonlinear LH/RH interface

Nonlinear surface waves at the interface separating two
conventional dielectric media have been analyzed exten-
sively for several decades starting from the pioneering

4

paper [12]. In brief, one of the major ﬁndings of those
studies is that the TE-polarized surface waves can exist
at the interface separating two RH media provided that
at least one of these is nonlinear, but that no surface
waves exist in the linear limit.

In this section, we study nonlinear surface waves as-
suming that both media are nonlinear, i.e. they display
a Kerr-type nonlinearity in their dielectric properties,
namely

ǫN L
1,2 = ǫ1,2 + α1,2

E
|

2,
|

(18)

where the ﬁrst term characterizes the linear properties,
i.e. those in the limit of vanishing wave amplitude.

First, we should mention that the recent systematic
study of nonlinear properties of metallic composites [13]
suggested the possibility of hysteresis-type nonlinear ef-
fects in a structure consisting of arrays of split-ring res-
onators (SRRs) and wires embedded in a nonlinear di-
electric medium. Such eﬀects can also be caused by a
nonlinear dielectric material placed in the slits of the
SRRs, which results in the intensity-dependent capaci-
tance of the slit. These hysteresis eﬀects can be avoided
if the structure is ﬁlled by a nonlinear dielectric material
except in the SRR slits.
In what follows, we consider
such composite structures for which the nonlinear prop-
erties can be characterized by Eq. (18) valid far from the
resonances.

For a conventional

right-handed) dielectric
(or
medium, positive α1 corresponds to a self-focusing non-
linear material, whilst negative α1 characterizes defocus-
ing eﬀects in the beam propagation. However, this classi-
ﬁcation becomes reversed in the case of LH materials and,
for example, the self-focusing LH medium corresponds to
negative α2. Indeed, taking into account relation (18), we
rewrite Eq. (5) for the case of the TE-polarized wave in
nonlinear media as follows,

E = 0.

(19)

Analyzing Eq. (19), we come to the conclusion that the
type of nonlinear self-action eﬀects is determined by the
product µ2α2. Therefore, in the LH medium with nega-
tive µ2 all nonlinear eﬀects are opposite to those in the
RH media with positive µ1, for the same α. Below, we
assume for deﬁniteness that both LH and RH materials
possess self-focusing properties, i.e. α1 > 0 and α2 < 0.
We look for the stationary solutions of Eq. (19) in the
form E1,2(x, z) = Ψ1,2(x) exp (ihz), where the envelopes
Ψ1,2(x) are found in the standard form

Analyzing the relations (25), we ﬁnd that a surface wave
always has the maximum of the ﬁeld intensity at the
interface. This is in a sharp contrast to the nonlinear
surface waves excited at the interface separating two RH
media, when the electric ﬁeld has maximum shifted into
a self-focusing nonlinear medium [14].

As an example, we consider the case XY < 1 for which,
as we have shown above, only forward surface waves can
exist at the interface between two linear media. However,
nonlinear surface waves can be both forward and back-
ward, as demonstrated in Fig. 4. For Y < 1, there exists
no linear limit for the existence of the surface waves,
while in other two regions the results for linear surface
waves are recovered in the limit P
0. The point on
the curve corresponding to P = 0 in the case Y < 1 de-
scribes the wave of ﬁnite amplitude in which the energy
ﬂows on either side of the interface are balanced. Such a
wave does not exist in the linear limit.

The dependence of the normalized energy ﬂux on the
wave number of the surface wave is shown in Fig. 5 for
XY > 1. In contrast to the linear waves, the nonlinear
surface waves can be both forward and backward (see
Fig. 1). In analogy with the case Y < 1 for the nonlinear
LH/linear RH interface, it can be shown that there exists
no small-amplitude limit for the nonlinear surface waves
for Y > 1 . For XY < 1 only forward travelling waves ex-
ist at Y > 1, revealing the property of the corresponding
linear waves.

IV.

FREQUENCY DISPERSION OF

NONLINEAR SURFACE WAVES

The group velocity of surface waves propagating along
the interface is determined in a standard way through the
|ω0, where ω0
slope of the dispersion curve, vg = ∂ω/∂h
is the carrier frequency of the surface wavepacket. As is
shown below, the energy ﬂow in the surface wave is pro-
portional to the group velocity. The analysis of a change
of the slope of the dispersion curve as a function of the
dielectric permittivity in the vicinity of the critical value
ǫc (see Fig. 2) suggests that we can change the type of the
surface wave from the forward to backward wave which
can be controlled by the change of the amplitude of the
electric ﬁeld when the RH material becomes nonlinear.
To demonstrate this property, we study the properties of
nonlinear surface waves near the critical point and select
ǫ1 = 3.4, in order to stay just below the critical value ǫc
corresponding to the linear case.

It should be mentioned here that although the nega-
tive permeability of the LH composite material is neces-
sary for the existence of TE surface waves in the present
model, it has been shown [15] that the TE surface waves
do exist at the interface between a RH nonlinear plasma

7

1.5
1.2

and a RH nonlinear dielectric medium with a constant
zero-ﬁeld permittivity, provided that the nonlinear pa-
rameter in the plasma exceeds that in the dielectric
medium.
In that case, since µ = 1 in both media, it
has also been shown [15] that the relation between the
wave intensity at the boundary and the frequency are
In the present case,
independent of the wave number.
where the LH composite material has a permeability not
equal to unity, this result is no longer valid. In our prob-
lem, Eq. (27) provides a dependence between the three
variables h, A2 and ω, so that the wave intensity at the
boundary depends on both h and ω.

As was shown for the case of linear surface waves, a
change of the slope of the dispersion curve takes place
at the critical value of dielectric permittivity of the RH
medium (13). In the nonlinear case, the dielectric permit-
tivity of the RH medium depends on the ﬁeld intensity
and, in particular, it exceeds the critical value when the
wave amplitude A2 becomes larger than the threshold
value A2c given by the equation

sponds to the line ω1 in Fig. 2; dotted line is η2 = 0.

For the media parameters used above, the equation (28)
gives the results: A2c = 0.3162. Figure 6 shows the
dispersion curves for three diﬀerent wave amplitudes. As
was discussed above, the slope of the curves is positive
for the wave amplitudes below the critical value (28),
and it is negative, otherwise. One can also notice from
Fig. 6 that the existence region for the surface waves
depends on the wave amplitude A2. In Fig. 7 we present
this existence region on the plane of the wave amplitude
and normalized frequency. The existence region of the
backward surface waves below the critical value collapses
at A2c, and it expands in the region of the forward surface
waves above the threshold. Note, that the forward and
backward waves exist at diﬀerent frequencies only.

η1, η2

The existence regions of the surface wave can be ex-
plained from the viewpoint of the physics of wave lo-
calization. The wave localization is determined by the
normalized transverse wavenumbers η1,2. As was men-
tioned above, these wavenumbers deﬁne the inverse decay
length of the surface wave in the corresponding medium.
The condition max
= 0 corresponds to the de-
localized waves, and it determines the boundary of the
wave existence. Figure 8 shows the dependence of the
normalized wave number on the wave amplitude for dif-
ferent frequencies. These curves represent the horizontal
cross-sections of the region of the wave existence shown
in Fig. 7. The dashed line in Fig. 8 shows the boundary
of localization of the wave in the LH material. Compar-
ing Fig. 8 and Fig. 7, we come to the conclusion that in
Fig. 7 the upper boundary for the existence of the for-
ward waves (below A2c) and the lower boundary for the
backward wave existence (above A2c) are determined by
the wave localization in the LH material.

which coincides with Eq. (29).

The absolute value of the ratio of the power ﬂow in
the RH nonlinear medium to the power ﬂow in the LH
composite medium is depicted in Fig. 9. Above the crit-
ical value Ac, there always exists a value of the wave
number at which the power ﬂow is positive. In this re-
gion, there exist a forward travelling surface wave. Note
that no matter what the value of the ﬁeld intensity at
the boundary is, there exists always some value of the
wave number where the ﬂow is negative and there exists
a backward travelling surface wave. This can be seen by
reference to Eq. (29). The presence of η2 in the denomi-
nator of Eq. (29) means that as h approaches a value that
makes η2 = 0 (i.e. a dispersion curve in Fig. 6 approaches
the dashed line) the negative power ﬂow in the LH ma-
terial dominates the total power ﬂow. Conversely, as η2
increases from zero, the negative power ﬂow in the LH
medium decreases so that, provided the intensity of the
electric ﬁeld at the boundary is high enough, the positive
power ﬂow in the nonlinear dielectric dominates.

V. PULSE PROPAGATION AND
SURFACE-WAVE SOLITONS

A. Envelope equation

Propagation of pulses along the interface between RH
and LH media is of a particular interest, since we have
shown above that the energy ﬂuxes are directed opposite
at either side of the interface. Therefore, we can expect
that the energy ﬂow in a pulse has a nontrivial form
and, in particular, it can be associated with a vortex-like
structure of the energy ﬂow.

We analyze the structure of surface waves of both tem-
poral and spatial ﬁnite extensions that can exist in such
a geometry. To obtain the equation describing the pulse
propagation along the interface, we look for the struc-
ture of a broad electromagnetic pulse with the carrier

frequency ω0 described by an asymptotic multi-scale ex-
pansion with the main terms of the general form

Ψ = eih0z−iω0t [Ψ0(x)A(ξ, t)

pulse propagation along the interface, we present the elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁelds of the pulse as follows

magnetic permittivity for the TE-polarized waves. These
conditions coincide with the conditions for the existence
of the corresponding surface waves and, therefore, surface
polaritons associated with the LH media should always
have such a distinctive vortex-like structure.

C. Surface-wave solitons

The existence of the surface polariton solitons has been
predicted in a number of structures supporting nonlinear
guided waves (see, e.g., Ref. [16] and references therein).
The corresponding nonlinear equation for describing the
evolution of the ﬁeld amplitude A at the interface is
known to have the form of the nonlinear Shr¨odinger

where ω2(h) =

dispersion relation. As is well-known, the NLS equation
has a solution in the form of a bright soliton localized at
the interface, provided the GVD has the opposite sign to
the sign of the nonlinear coeﬃcient ω2. In our problem,
we calculate the eﬀective nonlinear coeﬃcient for the case
of an interface between the nonlinear LH medium and the
linear RH medium, using Eq. (25):

The signs of the group velocity dω/dh and of the param-

for any reasonable values of dielectric permittivity and
magnetic permeability of the RH medium, there exists a
δ < 0, indicating the
range of frequencies for which ω2

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a systematic study of both linear
and nonlinear surface waves supported by an interface
between a left-handed metamaterial and a conventional
dielectric medium. For the linear regime, we have ex-
tended some earlier theoretical results and analyzed dif-
ferent types of surface waves and their existence regions.
In particular, we have demonstrated that the structure
of the energy ﬂow in a spatially localized wave-packet of
the surface waves propagating along the interface has a
vortex-like structure. For the case of nonlinear surface
waves, we have demonstrated that when only one of the
media is nonlinear the maximum amplitude of the spa-
tially localized wave does not shift out the interface. This
result is in a sharp contrast to the case of an interface be-
tween linear and nonlinear right-handed materials where
the maximum of a surface wave is always shifted into a

where the complex amplitudes (E(t), H(t)) are slowly
varying functions on the scale of the period of the carrier
frequency T = 2π/ω0, and c.c. stands for the complex
conjugate. Thus, the surface-wave pulse is assumed to
have a narrow spectrum in the vicinity of the carrier fre-
quency ω0. Then, the Poynting vector can be written in
the form of the expansion

Integrating this expression over the period T , we neglect

nally obtain Eq. (14), where both the electric and mag-
netic complex amplitudes are the slowly varying func-
tions of time. Using the asymptotic expansions (33) for
the ﬁeld components, we obtain the energy ﬂow structure

The structure of the Poynting vector in the surface-wave

that the energy rotates in the localized region creating a
vortex-type energy distribution in the wave. The diﬀer-
ence between the Poynting vector
integrated over the
RH medium and that calculated for the LH medium de-
termines the resulting group velocity of the surface wave
packet.

We notice that the distinctive vortex-like structure of
the surface waves at the interface separating RH and LH
media follows as a result of the opposite signs of the di-
electric permittivity for the TM-polarized waves and the

self-focusing nonlinear medium. We have demonstrated
that the group velocity of nonlinear surface waves can be
controlled by changing the intensity of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld and, in particular, the surface wave can be
switched from the forward propagating one to the back-

ward propagating one by varying the ﬁeld intensity only.
In addition, we have obtained the conditions for the ex-
istence of the surface-polariton solitons at the metama-
terial interface.

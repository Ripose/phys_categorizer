Electrostatic internal energy using the method of images

Abstract

For several conﬁgurations of charges in the presence of
conductors, the method of images permits to obtain some
observables associated with such a conﬁguration by replac-
ing the conductors with some image charges. However,
simple inspection shows that the potential energy associ-
ated with both systems does not coincide. Nevertheless, it
can be shown that for a system of a grounded conductor
and a distribution of charges outside, the external potential
energy associated with the real charge distribution embed-
ded in the ﬁeld generated by the set of image charges, is
twice the value of the internal potential energy associated
with the original system. This assertion is valid for any
size and shape of the conductor, and regardless of the con-
ﬁguration of images required. In addition, even in the case
in which the conductor is not grounded, it is still possible
to calculate the potential energy of the original conﬁgura-
tion through the method of images. These results show that
the method of images could also be useful for calculations
of the potential energy of the original system.

The method of images, is a useful tool to calculate elec-
trostatic ﬁelds, Green functions and forces that conductors
of certain shapes exert over some charges [1]-[3]. How-
ever, the energy of the conﬁguration is seldom treated by
this method, and applications are restricted to very spe-
cial cases [3]. Let us call system A (the real system) the
one consisting of a conductor and certain distribution of
charges outside of it, and system B (the virtual system)
the one consisting of the distribution of charges plus the
set of image charges, see Fig. 1. The reason that prevents
us to calculate the energy of the system A based on the

E2dV is not the same for
system B, is that the integral
both conﬁgurations, because in the region inside of the
conductor the electric ﬁeld is diﬀerent in each system. For
an arbitrary size and shape of the conductor there is not
any evident symmetry to connect the energies of both con-
ﬁgurations. Remarkably, despite of the lack of symmetry,
it can be demonstrated that for the system A with the con-
ductor grounded, the external potential energy associated
with the real distribution of charges in the presence of the
set of images, is twice the value of the internal potential
energy associated with the system A. This fact is true for
an arbitrary size and shape of the conductor, and what-
ever the conﬁguration of images is. Therefore, the method
of images could also be utilized for calculations of the po-
tential energy of the original system. Finally, the result
could be extended for the case in which the conductor is
not neccesarily grounded.

1 General approach

We want to ﬁnd the internal potential energy associated
with a system consisting of a point charge q, in the pres-
ence of a conductor (system A), we shall start from the

it is well known that Ec. (1) leads to divergences when
point particles are present because of the inclusion of self
energy terms [3]. Of course, the self energy term can be re-
moved to get only ﬁnite results. Extracting the self energy
and taking into account that the integral only contributes
in regions where charge is present, we get

where φs is the potential in the surface of the conductor,
r0 describes the location of the point charge, qc is the net
charge of the conductor, and φA (r0) is the electric poten-
tial at r0 due to all sources (excluding q itself i.e. remov-
ing the divergence). From the method of images [1]-[3],
the electric potential outside of the conductor is equiva-
lent to the electric potential generated by the system B
(the charge q plus the set of images). In particular, the
electric potential generated by the set of image charges at
the point r0 is given by1

Equation (5) is valid for an arbitrary form of the conduc-

of the real system, based on the potential energy associ-
ated with the point charge q in the presence of the image
charges. The result (5) can be further generalized by us-
ing the principle of superposition. So if instead of a point

particular, if the conductor is grounded we ﬁnd that

Physically, U (B)
ext is the work neccesary to bring the distri-
bution {qj} as a whole, from inﬁnity to their ﬁnal posi-
tions, in the presence of the image charges.

2 Simple applications

We shall work two types of scenarios (a) The conductor is
isolated (so the net charge qc is ﬁxed), (b) The potential
at the surface of the conductor is ﬁxed (e.g. grounded or
connected to a battery).

Example 1: The most typical problem treated by the
method of images is the one of a point charge and an
inﬁnite grounded conducting plane. For many purposes
such a system is equivalent to replace the conductor by
the appropiate image charge, forming a physical dipole.
Ref.
[3], shows that the energy stored in the system A,
is only one half of the energy stored in the system B. It
can be seen from two arguments, (a) The space can be
divided in two halves separated by the conductor. For the
E2dV give identical contributions
system B the integral
in both halves, while in system A only one of those halves
contribute to the energy. (b) Calculating the work necce-

work on q since the redistribution of the charges in the
conductor costs nothing for those charges are moving on
an equipotential. By contrast, if we assemble the system
B by bringing both charges simultaneously, we could work
on both of them symmetrically resulting a work twice as
great. This solution agrees with (7), and can be guessed
by arguments of symmetry. However, Eq. (7) holds far
beyond of this example.

Example 2: A point charge q at r0 in the presence
of an isolated, charged conductor with net charge qc. We
are interested in calculating the external work to bring q
from inﬁnity to r0. The net charge is invariant during
the process and the internal energy of the system at the
beginning and at the end of the process are obtained by
applying (4)

where φi

spectively, the set of images {¯qi} are the ones that ﬁt the
potential of the conductor at the end of the process (with
q lying at r0). We have assumed that the set of images
is localized all over the process to ensure that the poten-
tial energy associated to the point charge is zero when it
is located at inﬁnity. The external work to bring q from
inﬁnity to r0, is the change of internal energy

it is clear that the values of φf

of the conductor. Notice however, that if the net charge
is null, Wext becomes independent of those potentials and
the result has the same form as the one of the grounded
conductor (see Eqs. 7, 6) regardless of the geometry of the
conductor 2.

the set of images {¯qi} are the ones that ﬁt the potential

2Notwithstanding, the result is not necessarily the same for null
charge as for zero potential because the set of images is not in general
the same in both cases.

cording to the case studied. However ¯q2 is always at the
origin and the set ¯q1, ¯q2, q lies on the X−axis.

Example 4: The sphere is connected to a battery that
keeps its potential V constant. The structure of the set of

The grounded sphere appears when V = 0. By examining
the last line of Eq.
(14) we see that the ﬁrst term of
WFext is equivalent to the work to bring the charge q in
the presence of a charge ¯q2. It worths emphasizing that in
this term the factor 1/2 is not present because the charge
¯q2 is stationary in the process of bringing q, so that the
external force necessary to bring the charge is always of
the form ¯q2q/r2 in the direction of motion. By contrast,
in the second term the factor 1/2 is present and such a
term is equivalent to half of the work required to carry the
q charge in the presence of the image ¯q1if such an image
stayed always in its ﬁnal position. The reason is that along
the process the image charge ¯q1 must move along with the
real charge to keep its role as image charge.

Example 5: The sphere is isolated with net charge
qc. Again, the structure of images required appears in the
literature (see for instance sections 2.2, 2.3 of [2]), and in
the notation of Fig. (2) they read

; ¯x2 = 0,

(15)
the potential in the surface of the conductor when the
charge lies in its ﬁnal position, owes to the charge ¯q2 only,
since the potential generated by ¯q1 and q cancel each other
by construction. On the other hand, the potential in the
surface of the conductor when q lies at inﬁnity, is clearly
of the form qc/R, and using (15) the potentials on the

In the special case of qc = 0, there is no work on the
conductor similar to the case of a grounded sphere (V = 0
in Eq. 14). But in the case of null net charge, the work
necessary to bring the charge is larger than in the case of a
grounded sphere because a second image charge located at
the centre and of the same sign of q must be considered,
hence it leads to a repulsion that requires the external
work to be increased.

3 Conclusions

By using the method of images we have found a general
equation that permits to calculate the internal potential
energy associated with a conﬁguration consisting of a con-
ductor and a distribution of charges outside of the con-
ductor. The results show that the work necessary to bring
the distribution of charges in the presence of a grounded
conductor is just half of the external potential energy as-
sociated to the real charges in the presence of the ﬁeld
produced by the image charges. The result is general and
do not depend on any special symmetry of the system. Fi-
nally, even for no grounded conductors the energy of the
system can be obtained through the images. In particular

Abstract

The frequency band used by cellular telephones includes the eigenfrequencies of a dielectric sphere

with physical characteristics close to those of a human head. Proceeding from the spatial features

of the natural modes of such a sphere we propose an independent and clear evident accuracy test

for the complicated numerical calculations which are conducted when estimating the potential

hazard due to the use of cellular telephones, in particular, for the check of a proper handling of

the electromagnetic shape resonances of a human head.

Introduction. Estimation of the potential health hazard due to the use of cellular

telephones is now a problem of primary importance in view of extremely rapid development

and very wide spread of this communication aid. The safety guidelines in this ﬁeld [1]

are based on the ﬁndings from animal experiments that the biological hazards due to radio

waves result mainly from the temperature rise in tissues1 and a whole-body-averaged speciﬁc

absorption rate (SAR) below 0.4 W/kg is not hazardous to human health. This corresponds

to a limits on the output from the cellular phones (0.6 W at 900 MHz frequency band and

0.27 W at 1.5 GHz frequency band). Obviously, the local absorption rate should be also

considered especially in a human head [3]. Theoretical estimation of the temperature rise

in tissues of a human body are accomplished in the following way. First the electric and

magnetic ﬁelds inside the human body are calculated by solving the Maxwell equations with

a given source (antenna of a portable telephone). The electric ﬁeld gives rise to conduction

currents with the energy dissipation rate σ E2/2, where σ is the conduction constant of

respective tissues.

In turn it leads to the temperature increase. The second step is the

solution of the respective heat conduction equation (or more precisely, bioheat equation [3])

with local heat sources σ E2/2 and with allowance for all the possible heat currents. Hence,

for this method the distribution of electric ﬁeld inside the human body (especially inside the

head) is of primary importance.

In this letter we are going to argue that the knowledge of the properties of electromagnetic

modes for a dielectric sphere with physical characteristics close to those for a human head

can be useful, for example, when developing an independent accuracy test of complicated

numerical calculations mentioned above. The point is the eigenfrequencies of such a dielectric

sphere lie in the GSM 400 MHz frequency band which has been used in a ﬁrst generation

of mobile phone systems and now is considered for further use. Obviously, the natural

modes of a human head belong to this band too. The natural modes of a dielectric sphere

can be divided into two types, surface and volume modes. For the volume modes the

electromagnetic energy is distributed in the whole volume of the sphere while in the case

of surface modes this energy is located close by the sphere surface. All this holds for the

natural modes of a human head also, however we have no respective analytic formulas in

this case.

1 In principle, non-ionizing radiation can lead also to other eﬀects in biological tissues [2].

In order to be fully conﬁdent, that the pertinent numerical schemes handle the resonances

of a human head in a proper way, we propose an independent accuracy test of these calcu-

lations. Without such a check it is not obvious because the routines of numerical solving

the partial diﬀerential equations are local ones while the spatial behaviour of the relevant

eigenfunctions characterizes the system as a whole.

Shape resonances of a dielectric sphere. Let us consider a sphere of radius a,

consisting of a material which is characterized by permittivity ε1 and permeability µ1. The

sphere is placed in an inﬁnite medium with permittivity ε2 and permeability µ2. It is assumed

also that the electric currents are absent in both the media. The ﬁnite conductivity of the

material inside a sphere will be taken into account below.

It is known that in the source-free case (j = 0, ρ = 0) the general solution of Maxwell’s

equations are obtained from two scalar functions which may be chosen in diﬀerent ways [4, 5].

In the case of spherical symmetry these functions are the scalar Debye potentials ψ (see, for

example, the textbooks [6, 7]):

Equations (2) should be supplemented by the boundary conditions at the origin, at the

sphere surface and at inﬁnity.

In order for the ﬁelds to be ﬁnite at r = 0 the Debye

potentials should be regular there. Our goal is to ﬁnd the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions

in the problem at hand. Therefore at the spatial inﬁnity, radiation conditions should be

imposed [8, 9]

In this problem the spectral parameter is ω2/c2. Due to the radiation conditions (3) this

parameter is complex [9, 10]. Thus we are dealing here with shape resonances of a dielectric

sphere and the respective eigenfunctions are the quasi-normal modes [9, 11, 12, 13].

In order to obey the boundary conditions at the origin and at spatial inﬁnity formulated

above, the solution to the spectral problem (4) should have the form

fωl(r) = C1 jl(k1r) ,

r < a,

fωl(r) = C2 h(1)

l (k2r) ,

r > a ,

(5)

where jl(z) is the spherical Bessel function and h(1)

l (z) is the spherical Hankel function of

the ﬁrst kind [14], the latter obeys the radiation conditions (3).

At the sphere surface the tangential components of electric and magnetic ﬁelds (1) are

continuous. As a result, the eigenfrequencies of electromagnetic ﬁeld for this conﬁguration

are determined [6] by the frequency equation for the TE-modes

√ε1µ2 ˆj′

l(k1a) ˆhl(k2a)

√ε2µ1 ˆjl(k1a) ˆh′

l(k2a) = 0

and by the analogous equation for the TM-modes

√ε2µ1 ˆj′

l(k1a) ˆhl(k2a)

√ε1µ2 ˆjl(k1a) ˆh′

l(k2a) = 0 ,

where ki = √εiµi ω/c,
respectively, and ˆjl(z) and ˆhl(z) are the Riccati-Bessel functions [14]

i = 1, 2 are the wave numbers inside and outside the sphere,

ˆjl(z) = z jl(z) ,

ˆhl(z) = z h(1)

l (z) .

In equations (6) and (7) the orbital momentum l assumes the values 1, 2, . . ., and prime

stands for the diﬀerentiation with respect of the arguments k1a and k2a of the Riccati-

Bessel functions.

The roots of these equations have been studied in the Debye paper [15] by making use of an

approximate method. As the starting solution the eigenfrequencies of a perfectly conducting

sphere were used. In this case the frequencies are diﬀerent for electromagnetic oscillations

inside and outside sphere. Namely, inside sphere they are given by the roots of the equations

The frequency equations for perfectly conducting sphere (10), (11) and (12), (13) can be

formally derived by substituting (9) into frequency equations (6) and (7) and taking there

the limit ε

Approximate calculation of the eigenfrequencies of a dielectric sphere without using com-

puter [15] didnot allow one to reveal the characteristic features of the respective eigenfunc-

tions (quasi-normal modes). The computer analysis of this spectral problem was accom-

plished in the work [16] where the experimental veriﬁcation of the calculated frequencies

was conducted also by making use of radio engineering measurements.

These studies enable one to separate all the dielectric sphere modes into the interior and

exterior modes and, at the same time, into the volume and surface modes. It is worth noting

that all the eigenfrequencies are complex

ω = ω′

i ω′′ .

−

(14)

Thus we are dealing with ”leaky modes”. It is not surprising because we are considering

here an open system [17] (a dielectric ball and outer unbounded space).

The classiﬁcation of the modes as the interior and exterior ones relies on the investigation

of the behaviour of a given eigenfrequency in the limit ε

. The modes are called

”interior” when the product k a = √ε ω a/c remains ﬁnite in the limit ε

, provided the

imaginary part of the frequency (ω′′) tends to zero. The modes are referred to as ”exterior”

when the product k a/√ε = ω a/c remains ﬁnite with growing ω′′.

In the ﬁrst case the

frequency equations for a dielectric sphere (6) and (7) tend to (10) and (11) and in the

second case they tend to (12) and (13). The order of the root obtained will be denoted by

the index r for interior modes and by r′ for exterior modes. Thus TE lr and TM lr denote

the interior TE- and TM-modes, respectively, while TE lr′ and TM lr′ stand for the exterior

TE- and TM-modes.

For ﬁxed l the number of the modes of exterior type is limited because the frequency

equations for exterior oscillations of a perfectly conducting sphere (12) and (13) have ﬁnite

number of solutions [9]. In view of this, the number of exterior TE- and TM-modes is given

by the following rule. For even l there are l/2 exterior TE-modes and l/2 exterior TM-

modes, for odd l the number of the modes TE l r′ is (l + 1)/2 and the number of the modes

TM l r′ equals (l

1)/2.

An important parameter is the Q factor

Qrad =

ω′
2ω′′ = 2 π

stored energy
radiated energy per cycle

.

(15)

For exterior modes the value of Qrad is always less than 1, hence these modes can never be

observed as sharp resonances. At the same time for ε greater than 5, the Qrad for interior

modes is greater than 10 and it can reach very high values when ε

.

→ ∞

In the problem at hand the losses due to the radiation can be disregarded unlike the

Ohmic losses.

Indeed, the external source of electromagnetic energy (cellular telephone)

compensates the radiation losses. While the Ohmic losses lead to the temperature rising in

human tissues.

For physical implications more important is the classiﬁcation in terms of volume or surface

modes according to whether r > l or l > r. For volume modes the electromagnetic energy

is distributed in the whole volume of the sphere while in the case of surface modes the

energy is located close by the sphere surface. The exterior modes are the ﬁrst roots of the

characteristic equations and it can be shown that they are always surface modes.

Figure 1 shows a typical spatial behaviour of the surface and volume modes of a dielectric

Thus a substantial part of the sphere modes (about one half) belong to the interior surface

modes. It is important that respective frequencies are the ﬁrst roots of the characteristic

sphere.

sphere with ε = 40 placed in vacuum.

In order to escape the confusion, it is worth noting here that the surface modes in the

problem in question obey the same boundary conditions at the sphere surface and when

r

→ ∞

as the volume modes do. Hence, these surface modes cannot be classiﬁed as the

evanescent surface waves propagating along the interface between two media (propagating

waves along dielectric waveguides [7], surface plasmon waves on the interface between metal

bulk and adjacent vacuum [18, 19] and so on). When describing the evanescent waves one

imposes the requirement of their exponential decaying away from interface between two

media. In this respect the evanescent surface wave diﬀer from the modes in the bulk.

Features of dielectric sphere spectrum and their applications. The parts of

human body (for example, head) have the eigenfrequencies of electromagnetic oscillations

like any compact body. In particular, one can anticipate that the eigenfrequencies of human

head are close to those of a dielectric sphere with radius a

8 cm and permittivity ε

(for human brain ε = 44.1 for 900 MHz and ε = 42.8 for 1.5 GHz [3]). By making use of the

results of calculations conducted in the work [16] one can easily obtain the eigenfrequencies

of a dielectric sphere with the parameters mentioned above. For TEl1 modes with l = 1, 2, 3

we have, respectively, the following frequencies: 280 MHz, 420 MHz, and 545 MHz. For TMl1

modes with l = 1, 2, 3 the resonance frequencies are 425 MHz, 540 MHz, and 665 MHz. The

imaginary parts of these eigenfrequencies are very small so the Q factor in (15) responsible

for radiation is greater than 100.

These eigenfrequencies belong to a new GSM 400 MHz frequency band which is now

being standardized by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute. This band

was primarily used in Nordic countries, Eastern Europe, and Russia in a ﬁrst generation of

mobile phone system prior to the introduction of GSM.

Due to the Ohmic losses the resonances of a dielectric sphere in question are in fact

broad and overlapping.

Indeed, the electric conductance σ of the human brain is rather

substantial. According to the data presented in [3] σ

a dielectric dissipative sphere with allowance for a ﬁnite conductance σ can be found in

the following way. As known [20] the eﬀects of σ on electromagnetic processes in a media

possessing a common real dielectric constant ε are described by a complex dielectric constant

In view of such substantial Ohmic loses the resonance enhancement of the oscillation

amplitude inside a human head will not occur. However when the frequency of a mobile

telephone coincides with the eigenfrequency of the head the distribution of electric and

magnetic ﬁelds inside the head will be described by the corresponding normal mode which

may be a surface mode or a volume one [21].

Proceeding from this we propose the following test of numerical calculations used when

estimating the potential hazard of cellular telephones. The test consists in simulation of the

temperature distribution corresponding to the surface and volume modes in the framework

of pertinent calculation schemes. For simplicity, the test calculations could be accomplished

for a dielectric sphere (instead of a human head) with lower conductivity in comparison

with that for a human brain (in order to enhance the eﬀect). The distributions of electric

and magnetic ﬁelds and the temperature distribution inside the sphere should be calculated

for two eigenfrequencies of the sphere, namely, one frequency corresponds to surface mode

and another one belongs to volume mode. The distributions obtained should conform, at

least qualitatively, to the spatial behaviour of respective electromagnetic normal modes (see

Fig. 1).

Conclusion. Detailed analysis of electromagnetic spectra of a dielectric sphere enables

us to propose an independent accuracy test of complicated numerical calculations conducted

when estimating the potential health hazard due to use of cellular telephones. This test will

permit one to make certain of a proper handling of the electromagnetic shape resonances of

a human head in these studies.

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We compute the force acting on a free, static electric charge outside a uniform dielectric sphere.
We view this force as a self-interaction force, and compute it by applying the Lorentz force di-
rectly to the charge’s electric ﬁeld at its location. We regularize the divergent bare force using
two diﬀerent methods: A direct application of the Quinn-Wald Comparison Axiom, and Mode-Sum
Regularization.

INTRODUCTION

Φ into Legendre polynomials, one ﬁnds that

Electric charges which are placed in an inhomogeneous
ponderable medium undergo self interaction. The sim-
plest case is that of a static electric charge in an inho-
mogeneous dielectric. The self interaction of the charge
results in a self force (in other contexts this self force is
also known as a radiation reaction force), which acts to
accelerate the charge. In the static problem, then, one
can ask the following question: What is the external,
possibly non-electric, force which needs to be exerted on
the charge to keep it static when a non-uniform dielectric
is present?

In this paper we study this question for a very sim-
ple case. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd the self force on a point-
like electric charge e outside a uniform dielectric sphere.
(By an inhomogeneous dielectric we here mean the dis-
continuity of the dielectric constant at the surface of the
sphere.) The origin of the force on the charge in this case
is simple: The charge polarizes the dielectric at order e.
The induced electric ﬁeld then back-reacts on the origi-
nal charge, and this interaction then is at order e2. In
fact, one can compute the force on the charge following
this simple physical picture. However, one can employ
a diﬀerent picture, in which the force on the charge is
construed as a self force. The charge interacts with its
own ﬁeld, and the latter is distorted by the presence of
the dielectric sphere.
In this picture the force is com-
puted locally, using only the ﬁelds at the location of the
charge. The local approach has many merits. Speciﬁ-
cally, the computation of the near ﬁeld is much simpler,
and one does not have to compute additional quantities
such as the far ﬁeld or the sphere’s polarization. (The
ﬁelds at great distances of course contribute to the force
on the charge, but for the local approach only through
boundary conditions.) A similar approach was used in
Ref. [1] to compute the radiated power of synchrotron
radiation using only the near ﬁeld. The diﬃculty in the
local approach arises from the well known fact that the
ﬁeld of a point charge diverges when the evaluation point
for the ﬁeld coincides with the ﬁeld’s source. In fact, this
happens already for a static charge in empty (and ﬂat)
spacetime. Let the charge e be located on the ˆz-axis in
spherical coordinates. Decomposing the scalar potential

where r< (r>) is the smaller (greater) of the r values of
the source’s location r0 and the evaluation point. The
(self) force acting on the charge is then given by the
(average of the two one-sided) gradients of the potential.

which clearly diverges. (The derivation of the last equa-
tion is given below.) In this illustration of the problem, of
course, it is clear that the regularized, physical self force
vanishes: The force obviously cannot depend on where
we choose to put the origin of our coordinate system.
(Also, we have ample observational evidence that static
isolated charges remain static.)

There is a long history of works on the self force. (For
reviews see, e.g., [2].) Recently, the analogous problem
of calculation of self forces in curved spacetimes (also for
the gravitational case where the self interaction pushes
a body with ﬁnite mass oﬀ a geodesic) has gained much
interest [3, 4]. In this paper we shall make use of some of
the techniques, which have been developed for self inter-
action in curved spacetime, for the problem of interest.
(Interestingly, there is a close link between electromag-
netism in static gravitational ﬁelds and electromagnetism
in matter. As is well known [5], Maxwell’s equations
in vacuum in static curved spacetime can be written as
Maxwell’s equations in ﬂat spacetime with an eﬀective
non-uniform dielectric.) Speciﬁcally, we shall make use
of the Quinn-Wald Comparison Axiom [6] and Mode-Sum
Regularization [4] in order to extract the physical, ﬁnite
piece of the self force.

The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section
II we solve for the scalar potential, and obtain the modes
of the bare force. This is, in fact, a standard exercise in

ize the self force using two diﬀerent approaches, and in
Section IV we discuss the properties of our result.

II. DERIVATION OF THE BARE FORCE

Consider a static electric charge e in vacuum at radius
r0, outside an insulated sphere of radius R of uniform
dielectric constant ǫ = 1 + ǫ0, where ǫ0 > 0. Notice,
that ǫ0 is not the permittivity of free space, but rather
ǫ0 = 4πχe, where χe is the electric susceptibility. We
place the charge e on the ˆz-axis without loss of generality.
This conﬁguration is plotted in Figure 1.

Maxwell’s equation in matter is

D = 4πρ

∇ ·

(1)

where D = ǫE is the displacement ﬁeld, E is the electric
ﬁeld, and ρ is the density of free charges.

We assume that the distribution of the dielectric is
spherically symmetric (although non-uniform). Speciﬁ-
cally, we take ǫ = ǫ(r). (Despite the uniformity of the
sphere, the dielectric constant throughout space depends
on r: it suﬀers a step-function discontinuity at the sur-
face of the sphere.) In the usual spherical coordinates
Eq. (1) becomes

The boundary conditions for this equation are that φℓ is

are that

The bare force f bare is found by f bare =

ated at the location of the charge at r = r0 and ϑ = 0.
From symmetry, it is clear that any force is radial. We
compute, then, the radial component of the force only.

Clearly, Eq. (11) diverges. This comes as no surprise, as
we have already mentioned that this divergence occures
already for a charge in empty space. In the next section
we shall extract the physical, ﬁnite part of this inﬁnite
bare force.

III. REGULARIZATION OF THE BARE FORCE

In order to regularize the bare force (11), we make di-
rect use of the Quinn-Wald comparison axiom, for which
plausible arguments were given. The Comparison Axiom
states the following (see [6] for more details): Consider
two points, P and ˜P , each lying on time-like world lines
in possibly diﬀerent spacetimes which contain Maxwell
ﬁelds Fµν and ˜Fµν sourced by particles of charge e on the
world lines. If the four-accelerations of the world lines
at P and ˜P have the same magnitude, and if we iden-
tify the neighborhoods of P and ˜P via the exponential
map such that the four-velocities and four-accelerations
are identiﬁed via Riemann normal coordinates, then the
diﬀerence between the electromagnetic forces fµ and ˜fµ
is given by the limit x
0 of the Lorentz force associ-
ated with the diﬀerence of the two ﬁelds averaged over a
sphere at geodesic distance x from the world line at P ,
i.e.,

→

E

Here, we identify the “tilde” spacetime as that of a
globally empty spacetime. Obviously, ˜fµ = 0. We em-
phasize that this axiom assumes a nearly trivial form for
the case of interest: The local neighborhood of the par-
ticle in question and of a similar particle in a (globally-
)empty spacetime are identical. (It is only the far-away
properties of spacetime – as represented by diﬀerent di-
electric constants – which are diﬀerent for the two space-
times.) Another remark is that we do not need to average
here over directions, as the forces in our case are direc-
tion independent. Consider now Eq. (9) for the potential.
Outside the dielectric sphere the potential Φ contains the
vacuum potential Φvac and a correction ∆Φ. We next use

Φvac to construct the ﬁelds ˜Fµν . Applying the Compari-
son Axiom, we ﬁnd that the self force is given by

to ﬁnd this result in the literature. (In view of the vast-
ness of the literature on classical electromagnetism, our
search in the literature is naturally incomplete.)

Before we analyze the properties of this result, let us
derive it using a second method. Speciﬁcally, we use
Mode-Sum Regularization. (Note, that Mode-Sum Reg-
ularization is based on the Quinn-Wald result for the self
force in curved spacetime, the latter being a consequence
of the Comparison Axiom.
In that sense, these two
methods are not entirely independent. Here, however,
we make direct use of the Comparison Axiom, which is
necessary but not suﬃcient in order to derive the Quinn-
Wald result.) Mode-Sum Regularization is described in
Refs. [4]. In Mode-Sum regularization one ﬁnds two reg-
ularization functions, hℓ
µ and dµ. The regularized self
force is given by

eral form hℓ
needs the local properties of spacetime in order to deter-
mine these functions. As locally the charge is in empty
space (it is removed from the dielectric sphere), it is clear
that the regularization functions hℓ
µ and dµ would be the
same as in a globally-empty spacetime. Indeed, it is easy
to ﬁnd the limit as ℓ
of the modes of the bare force.
The modes of the radial component of the bare force
(11) approach e2/(2r2
µ must have the
same asymptotic structure (as ℓ
µ, this implies
that hℓ
0), identically the same as in (globally-
)empty spacetime, in agreement with the previous rea-
soning. We similarly expect the function dr to vanish,
as it does in a globally-empty ﬂat spacetime. We justify
this expectation a posteriori by demonstrating that this
leads to the same expression as we received by using the
Comparison Axiom. It then follows that the regularized

self force as a function of ǫ0, for r0 = 2cm. Lower panel (B):
The self force as a function of r0 (in cm), for ǫ0 = 10.7.

IV. PROPERTIES OF THE RESULT

We found that the self force on the charge e is given
by Eq. (14). This is an attractive force, as indeed is
expected. (The charge e polarizes the sphere such that
there is an excess of oppositely-charged induced charge
on the sphere closer to the free charge. Hence the polar-
ization charge acts to attract the free charge.) We can
check our result in the limiting case of inﬁnite dielectric,
, which corresponds to the case of an uncharged,
ǫ0 → ∞
insulated, conducting sphere.
In that limit our result

For any ﬁnite value of ǫ0 the force is smaller in magni-
tude than in the case of a conducting sphere (16). This
behavior is shown in Fig. 2A, which plots the self force
as a function of ǫ0 for ﬁxed r0. It can be seen that as

Fig. 2B, which displays the self force as a function of r0
for ﬁxed ǫ0. We can check the validity of this limit by
deriving Eq. (18) using the alternative picture [9]. When
R, we can treat the ﬁeld of the charge e to the

leading order in 1/r0 as a constant over the sphere. Let
us take for simplicity the charge e = sgn(e)

then is just a constant inside the sphere, and is given by

be obtained by a volume integral over P. One ﬁnds then
that p = [ǫ0/(3 + ǫ0)]R3E0. The electric ﬁeld E at r0ˆz is

When r0 approaches R the self force grows rapidly,
and in the limit diverges. This is indeed expected: in this
limit one has a point charge near a semi-inﬁnite dielectric.
The solution for the force is a classic image problem [8],
which obviously diverges in the coincidence limit of the
charge and its image. This divergence happens already
in the case of the conducting sphere, as is evident from

zero gradient of the dielectric constant.

We note that the magnitude of this self force is not
extremely small for realistic parameters. Take the charge
e to be that of an electron of mass me, and the dielectric
sphere to be made of Silicon, for which ǫ0 = 10.7 at room
temperature and pressure, and take the sphere to be of
radius 1cm. In the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth, with
gravitational acceleration of 980cm/sec2, the self force
equals the weight of the electron when r0 = 13.2cm

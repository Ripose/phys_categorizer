We present a simple example in which the importance of the inertial eﬀects of stress is evident.
The system is an insulating solid narrow disc whose faces are uniformly charged with charges of equal
magnitude and opposite signs. The motion of the system in two diﬀerent directions is considered.
It is shown how the contributions to energy and momentum of the stress that develops inside the
solid to balance the electrostatic forces have to be added to the electromagnetic contributions to
obtain the results predicted by the relativistic equivalence of mass and energy.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, a proposal for the solution of the century old
problem of the self-interaction of a charged particle was
presented.1 One of the puzzles of this problem2 is that
the momentum of the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a parti-
cle with electrostatic energy Ue moving with velocity v
is not Ueγv as required by relativity, but is 4
3 Ueγv. It
was shown1 that the discrepancy is due to the neglect
of the inertia of the stress that is present in the particle
to balance the electrostatic repulsion. Unlike the inertia
of energy, which is well known, many physicists are not
aware of the inertia of pressure (stress). In many cases
such an eﬀect is negligible, but for the case of the stress
produced by electrostatic interactions, it is comparable
to the inertial eﬀects of the electromagnetic ﬁelds. If the
inertia of stress is neglected, the calculations are incon-
sistent. In this paper we give an example in which these
considerations are explicitly shown.

II. THE SYSTEM

We consider a solid disc of insulating material with
radius R and thickness h such that h ≪ R (see Fig. 1).
For simplicity we assume that the material has a unit
relative dielectric constant, ǫ = ǫ0. Both faces of the disc
are uniformly charged with opposite charges Q and −Q.
The axis of the disc is parallel to the z axis. The lower
face is positively charged. The surface charge density
of the lower face is σ = Q/A, where A = πR2.
If we
neglect border eﬀects, the electric ﬁeld is E = (σ/ǫ0)ˆz
at any point inside the material and zero outside. The
electrostatic energy is

are repulsive for elements in the same face and attractive for
elements in opposite faces.

The opposite charges in the faces attract each other,
compressing the body (see Fig. 2). A positive stress de-
velops for surfaces parallel to the faces. In contrast, the
repulsion between charged elements of the same face pro-
duces a radial stretching of the body. Hence, for surfaces

parallel to the z axis there is a negative stress that bal-
ances the repulsion. That is, the stress tensor is diagonal;
P11 and P22 are equal and negative and P33 is positive
(see Fig. 3).

The standard way of calculating the stress is to use
Maxwell’s tensor, but to keep the exposition as elemen-
tary as possible we will determine the stress using energy
considerations. If the thickness h is increased, the stress
in the z-direction does a work that is the opposite to the
work of the compressing force that it balances.

Let m0 be the rest mass of the disc if it were not
charged and Ue be the electrostatic energy. Then the
equivalence between mass and energy predicts that if the
disc moves with velocity v, its energy is (m0c2 + Ue)γ

2

and its momentum is (m0 + Ue/c2)γv, where γ = [1 −
(v/c)2]−1/2.

The contributions of the electromagnetic ﬁelds to the
energy and momentum are obtained by integrating the
energy density u and the Poynting vector S over the vol-
ume:

We will now evaluate the electromagnetic contributions

for the disc moving in two diﬀerent directions.

III. MOTION PARALLEL TO THE AXIS OF
THE DISK

Consider the disc moving with velocity v = vˆz (see
Fig. 4). Quantities for the moving body are denoted by
a prime. The circular faces remain the same, A′ = A, so
the charge density is the same σ′ = σ, but the thickness
is reduced by the Lorentz contraction h′ = hγ−1. The
electric ﬁeld is also the same E′ = E.
Inside the disc
∂E/∂t = 0, so there is no magnetic ﬁeld B′ = 0. Then
u′ = u and S′ = 0. Finally

Uem = u

(10)

(11)

We see that there is no contribution to the momentum
even though we might have expected c−2Ueγv and that
the energy decreases as γ−1 instead of increasing as γ.
Considering only the electromagnetic ﬁelds does not give
the correct result.

V. THE INERTIA OF STRESS

Now consider the disc moving with velocity v = vˆx
(see Fig. 5). The thickness is the same h′ = h, but the
faces become elliptical because of Lorentz contraction in
the x-direction. The area is reduced A′ = Aγ−1. The
charge density is increased σ′ = σγ and so is the electric
ﬁeld E′ = γE. There is also a magnetic ﬁeld inside the
disc produced by the two sheets of opposite currents. The
ﬁeld can be calculated using Amp`ere’s law

In this case the result is also not as might be expected.
The energy has an extra (v/c)2 term and the momentum
is twice the expected value. The energy and momentum
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld do not form a four-vector, and
the eﬀective mass is anisotropic. Something is missing
and that is the inertia of stress.

FIG. 5: Disc moving in the x-direction. The thickness is the
same, but the area of the faces is reduced by Lorentz contrac-

in the surface charge density, σ′

ﬁeld B′ = c−2v × E′. Therefore there is a contribution to the
momentum.

We will use the following relativistic conventions, x0 =
−x0 = ct, x1 = x1 = x, x2 = x2 = y, and x3 = x3 = z.
Greek indices take the values 0–3, and Latin indices take
the values 1–3. The unit vectors in the direction of the
spatial axes are ˆei. Repeated indices indicate an implicit
sum. The four-velocity uα is related to the velocity v =
viˆei by, ui = γvi and u0 = cγ.

The relativistic dynamics of a continuous medium
is ruled by the energy and momentum conservation
equation4

∇α(Θαβ + P αβ) = f β,

(16)

where f β is the force density four-vector, Θαβ is the en-
ergy, and momentum density four-tensor, and P αβ is the
stress four-tensor. Both Θαβ and P αβ are symmetric
tensors. The spatial components of f β form the force
density, f = f iˆei. The temporal component is propor-
tional to the power density, f 0 = (f · v)/c. The energy-
momentum tensor is obtained from the four-velocity by

Θαβ = ˜µuαuβ.

(17)

The four-scalar ˜µ is the density of the rest mass with
respect to the proper volume (the volume of an element
at rest). The usual rest mass density is µ = ˜µγ. The
spatial part of Θαβ is the momentum current density
Θij = µγvivj, and Θ00 is the energy density, Θ00 = µc2γ.
The other elements of Θαβ with only one temporal index
are the energy current density vector c Θi0ˆei and the mo-
mentum density vector c−1Θ0iˆei.

The stress four-tensor P αβ reduces to the purely spa-
tial stress tensor when the matter element is at rest.
When the element is moving, there are temporal com-
ponents that contribute to the energy density P 00 and
to the momentum density P 0i/c. That is, the stress has
inertial eﬀects. Because uα is purely temporal at rest, we
have

P αβuβ = 0.

(18)

Equation (18) is valid in any reference frame and can be
used to obtain the temporal components of the stress,
which are

P ijvj ,

P 00 =

c2 P ijvivj,

(19a)

(19b)

where P ij is the stress tensor in that frame.

By separating the spatial and temporal components,
Eq. (16) reduces to the momentum and power equations,

) = f ,

(20)

It is interesting to compare these equations with the

(22)

Here u is the energy density of matter which includes the
kinetic and internal energies. Note that the only contri-
butions of the stress which appear in the non-relativistic
equations are those in the divergence terms. Also note
that the stress that multiplies the velocity in the time
derivative of Eq. (20) does not vanish in the small veloc-
ity limit (v/c → 0). This case is an example in which
the non-relativistic limit (c → ∞) is diﬀerent from the
small velocity limit. That is, the inertia of stress is a
purely relativistic phenomenon, which does not have a
Newtonian explanation.

Everything works if we take into account the contribu-

The energy and momentum of an extended system
are obtained by integrating the energy density and
the momentum density over the entire volume. The
spaces of two diﬀerent reference frames are diﬀerent
three-dimensional hyperplanes in the four-dimensional
Minkowski space. So, in principle, the total energy and
momentum of an extended system in diﬀerent frames are

not the same physical quantities. If energy and momen-
tum are conserved, they form a four-vector. When the
electromagnetic ﬁeld is not free, that is, when there are
charges and currents, the ﬁeld itself is stressed. This
stress contributes to the energy and momentum of the
ﬁeld, which is why these quantities do not form a four-
vector. The electromagnetic forces produce stresses in
matter. The stress of matter also contributes to the en-
ergy and momentum, and also do not form a four-vector.
The contributions of the stress of matter are exactly op-
posite to those of the stress of the ﬁeld. Thus, if the

contributions of the stress of matter are added to those
of the ﬁeld, the total energy and momentum transform
as a four-vector.

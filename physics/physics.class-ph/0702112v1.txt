Abstract

Modern ether-drift experiments look for a preferred reference frame searching for modulations

of the beat note of two optical resonators that might be induced by the Earth’s rotation. We

present a compact formalism to evaluate the signal for most experiments where two arbitrary

gaseous media ﬁll the resonating cavities. Our predictions can provide useful hints to optimize

the experimental set up and the data taking.

1. In modern ether-drift experiments with optical resonators, the search for the possible
existence of a preferred reference frame is performed by looking for modulations of the signal

that might be induced by the Earth’s rotation. Descriptions of this important eﬀect are

already available in the literature. For instance, within the SME model [1] the relevant

formulas are given in the appendix of Ref.[2] and for the RMS test theory [3] one can look at

Ref.[4]. However, either due to the great number of free parameters (19 in the SME model)

and/or to the restriction to a deﬁnite experimental set up, it is not always easy to adapt

these papers to the various experimental conditions. For this reason, in this Letter, we will

present a set of compact formulas that can be immediately used by the reader to evaluate the

signal when two arbitrary gaseous media ﬁll the resonating cavities. The formalism covers

most experimental set up including the very recent type of experiment proposed in Ref.[5].

In our presentation one clearly understands that the Earth’s rotation enters only through

two quantities, v = v(t) and θ0 = θ0(t), respectively the magnitude and the angle associated
with the projection of the unknown cosmic Earth’s velocity V in the plane of the interferom-
eter. At the same time, our predictions can provide useful hints to optimize the experimental

set up and the data taking.

2. Once the angle θ0 is conventionally deﬁned when one of the arms of the interferometer
is oriented to the North point in the laboratory (counting θ0 from North through East),

we can immediately use the formulas given by Nassau and Morse [6]. These are valid for

short-term observations, say 3-4 days, where there are no appreciable changes in the cosmic

velocity due to changes in the Earth’s orbital velocity around the Sun so that the only time

dependence is due to the Earth’s rotation.

In this approximation, introducing the magnitude V of the full Earth’s velocity with

respect to a hypothetic preferred frame Σ, its right ascension α and angular declination γ,

we get

cos z(t) = sin γ sin φ + cos γ cos φ cos(τ − α)

sin z(t) cos θ0(t) = sin γ cos φ − cos γ sin φ cos(τ − α)

sin z(t) sin θ0(t) = cos γ sin(τ − α)

v(t) = V sin z(t),

where z = z(t) is the zenithal distance of V, φ is the latitude of the laboratory and τ = ωsidt
is the sidereal time of the observation in degrees (ωsid ∼ 2π

23h56′ ).

Let us now consider two orthogonal cavities oriented for simplicity to North (cavity 1)

and East (cavity 2) in the laboratory frame. They are ﬁlled with two diﬀerent gaseous media

with refractive indices Ni (i=1,2) such that Ni = 1 + ǫi, and 0 ≤ ǫi ≪ 1. The frequency in

each cavity is

and the frequency shift is

νi(θi) = ¯u′

i(θi)ki

∆ν = ν1(θ1) − ν2(θ2)

ki =

mi
2Li

In the above relations we have introduced the parameters ki

where mi are integers ﬁxing the cavity modes, Li are the cavity lengths and ¯u′
i(θi) denote
the two-way speeds of light, as measured in the Earth’s frame, θi being the angle between V
and the axis of the i-th cavity.

Following the point of view of Refs.[7, 8, 9], that no observable Fresnel’s drag has ever

been detected in the gaseous regime, we shall assume that the two speeds of light c

Ni are seen
isotropic in the preferred frame Σ. Using Lorentz transformations to connect to the Earth’s
frame, one then obtains to O(V 2/c2) [7]

with

¯u′

We emphasize that the structure in Eq.(8), although obtained in connection with Eqs.(9) by

using Lorentz transformations, remains also valid under the more general assumptions of the

RMS test theory [3]. As such, if Ai and Bi are considered as free parameters, it provides a

physical framework that is equivalent to the RMS model.

Introducing the unit vectors ˆui ﬁxing the direction of the two cavities and the projection

v of the full V in the interferometer’s plane one ﬁnds

V 2 sin2 θi = V 2(1 − cos2 θi) = V 2 − (ˆui · v)2

so that (v = |v|)

and

V 2 sin2 θ1 = V 2 − v2 cos2 θ0

V 2 sin2 θ2 = V 2 − v2 sin2 θ0

Therefore, deﬁning the reference frequency ν0 = ck1

one ﬁnds the relative frequency shift

On the other hand for a non-symmetric apparatus of the type considered in Ref.[5] with

L1 = L2 = L, but where one can conveniently arrange N1 = 1 (up to negligible terms) so
that A1 ∼ B1 ∼ 0, denoting N2 = N , A2 = A, B2 = B, m2

To consider experiments where one or both resonators are placed in a state of active rotation

(at a frequency ωrot ≫ ωsid), it is convenient to modify Eq.(14) by rotating the resonator 1

by an angle δ1 and the resonator 2 by an angle δ2 so that the last term in Eq.(14) becomes

v2(t)
c2 [B1 cos2(δ1 − θ0(t)) − ξB2 sin2(δ2 − θ0(t))]
Therefore, in a fully symmetric apparatus where N1 = N2, A1 = A2, B1 = B2 = B and ξ = 1

(17)

and both resonators rotate, as in Ref.[10], setting

δ1 = δ2 = ωrott

one obtains

∆ν(t)symm
ν0

v2(t)
c2

= B

cos 2(ωrott − θ0(t))

On the other hand, if only one resonator rotates, as in Ref.[11], setting δ1 = 0 and δ2 = ωrott

one obtains the alternative result

∆ν(t)
ν0

= B

v2(t)
2c2 [cos 2θ0(t) + cos 2(ωrott − θ0(t))]

By ﬁrst ﬁltering the signal at the frequency ω = ωrot ≫ ωsid, the main diﬀerence between the

two expressions is an overall factor of two.

we obtain the simple Fourier expansion

= 1 − ξ + (f0 + f1 sin τ + f2 cos τ + f3 sin 2τ + f4 cos 2τ )

(21)

where

Since the mean signal is most likely aﬀected by systematic eﬀects, one usually concentrates

on the daily modulation. In this case, assuming that f1, f2, f3 and f4 can be extracted to

good accuracy from the experimental data, one can try to obtain a pair of angular variables

through the two independent determinations of α

and the relation

tan α =

Notice that, since the ether-drift is a 2nd-harmonic eﬀect, the pair (α, γ) cannot be distin-

guished from the pair (α + π, −γ). Notice also that two dynamical models that predict the

same anisotropy parameters up to an overall re-scaling Bi → λBi would produce the same

|γ| from the experimental data.

Finally for a symmetric apparatus, where B1 = B2 = B and ξ = 1, one obtains the

simpler relation

4. Summarizing: starting from the hypothetical observation of a non-trivial daily mod-
ulation of the signal in some ether-drift experiment, one might meaningfully consider the

possibility of a preferred reference frame. For instance, for a symmetric apparatus one could
try to extract from the data the product K = B V 2
c2 and, using Eqs.(25) and (27), a pair

(25)

(26)

(27)

of angular values (α, γ). Of course, in this case, by suitably changing the gaseous medium

within the cavities, one should also try to check the trend predicted in Eq.(9), namely

K ′
K ′′ ∼

N ′ − 1
N ′′ − 1

(28)

On the other hand, for a non-symmetric apparatus of the type proposed in Ref.[5], where one

can conveniently ﬁx the cavity oriented to North to have N1 = 1 (up to negligible terms),

by using Eqs.(9) one would predict B1 ∼ 0 in Eqs.(23) and (24) so that all time dependence

should be due to B2. Thus the modulation of the signal should be a pure ω = 2ωsid eﬀect

with no appreciable contribution at ω = ωsid. This is another sharp prediction that should

be preliminarily checked.

For a deeper analysis, it is important to recall that the ether-drift, if it exists, is a 2nd-

harmonic eﬀect. Therefore, in a single session, the direction (α, γ) cannot be distinguished

from the opposite direction (α + π, −γ). For this reason, a whole set j=1,2..M of short-term

experimental sessions should be performed in diﬀerent periods along the Earth’s orbit to

obtain an overall consistency check.

Notice that for a complete description of the observations over a one-year period, it is

not necessary to modify the simple formulas Eqs.(23) and (24) and introduce explicitly the
further modulations associated with the orbital frequency Ωorb ∼ 2π
1 year . Rather, by plotting
on the celestial sphere all directions deﬁned by the various (αj, γj) pairs obtained in the

various short-term observations one can try to reconstruct the Earth’s “aberration circle”. If

this will show up, one can determine the mean magnitude of the cosmic velocity hV i from

the angular opening of the circle and from the known value of the orbital Earth’s velocity

∼ 30 km/s. In this way, given the value of hKi, one will be able to disentangle hV i from

B and get a deﬁnitive test of models that predict the absolute magnitude of the anisotropy

parameter.

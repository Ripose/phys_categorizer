Abstract

We introduce a theory for the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by
small metal particles, which generalises the random phase approximation by
incorporating both electric and magnetic dipole absorption within a uniﬁed
self-consistent scheme. We demonstrate the equivalence of the new approach
to a superﬁcially dissimilar perturbative approach. We show how to obtain
solutions to the self-consistent equations using a classical approximation, tak-
ing into account the non-locality of the polarisability and the conductivity
tensor. We discuss the nature of the self-consistent solutions for diﬀusive and
ballistic electron dynamics.

I. INTRODUCTION

The quantum theory of absorption of radiation by small metal particles has proved to
be a diﬃcult area, partly because it has not always been realised that the internal electric
ﬁeld must be treated self-consistently, and partly because of confusion about how to obtain
the self-consistent ﬁeld. The literature is surveyed in [1-3], and the introductory sections of
[4] and [5] include a brief review of the literature relevant to the present paper. This paper
extends a series of works [4-8] which have considered the self-consistent potential from a
semiclassical viewpoint.

First we clarify the regimes in which our results are applicable. The following frequency
scales are relevant to the interaction of small metal particles with radiation. The lowest scale
a−d, where a is
is given by the mean level spacing ∆, i.e., ω∆ = ∆/¯h. In d dimensions ω∆
the characteristic size of the particle. Another typical frequency scale is given by the inverse
of the typical time taken for an electron to traverse the particle. In systems with diﬀusive
electron motion it is given by ωc = D/a2, where D is the diﬀusion constant. In particles with
ballistic electron motion, ωc is given by the inverse time of ﬂight, ωc = vF/a, where vF is the
Fermi velocity. The highest frequency scales are the plasma frequency ωp and the frequency
a−1/2, whereas in three
ωF = EF/¯h derived from the Fermi energy. In two dimensions, ωp
dimensions ωp is comparable to the Fermi frequency, which is independent of the size of the
particle. The frequency scales are therefore ordered as follows

ω∆ (which justiﬁes the neglect of
Our results are relevant to frequencies satisfying ω
quantum eﬀects), and ω
ωp (which means that screening of external ﬁelds by polarisation
of the particle is signiﬁcant). There are six relevant length scales in the problem, namely
the wave length λ of the external radiation, the linear dimension a of the particle, the skin
depth λs, the Thomas-Fermi screening length λTF, the Fermi wavelength λF and the mean
free path l. In the following it will be assumed that

Under these conditions the absorption can be divided into electric and magnetic dipole
contributions. In earlier papers these were discussed separately: the electric dipole absorp-
tion was discussed for various diﬀerent situations in [4-7], and the magnetic dipole absorption
case was discussed in [8]. It is desirable to have a uniﬁed description. In section II we de-
velop a generalisation of the commonly used ‘random phase approximation’ [9] scheme which
gives a uniform approach to both electric and magnetic dipole absorption. Most treatments
of the electric dipole absorption coeﬃcient are based upon calculating the imaginary part
of the polarisability. References [4-7] used an alternative approach, namely time dependent
perturbation theory in the eﬀective potential. In section III we show that these apparently
dissimilar approaches are equivalent.

We also discuss a uniﬁed approach to determining the self-consistent ﬁeld: we present
some new results for the ballistic case, where the bulk mean free path of the electrons is
large compared to the dimensions of the particle. Section VI describes the form of the non-
local polarisability, and section V discusses a general semiclassical method for determining

2

the self-consistent ﬁeld. We show that the self-consistent potential used in [4,6], which
treated electric dipole absorption ballistic systems, was not correct for ω
ωc. Section VI
summarises the results, and presents an argument indicating that the results of [4,6] are
nevertheless qualitatively correct.

II. CALCULATION OF THE ABSORPTION COEFFICIENT

This section will discuss the general principles underlying the calculation of the electro-

magnetic response.

A. Formulation of the problem

An electromagnetic wave induces currents which result in both electric and magnetic
In what follows we will only consider
polarisation of a conducting conducting particle.
linear eﬀects (where the polarisation is proportional to the applied ﬁeld), and the externally
applied ﬁeld will be assumed to be uniform over the dimension of the particle. We will only
be concerned with the coeﬃcients relating dipolar moments to the externally applied ﬁeld:
higher moments will not be considered. The electric dipole d and magnetic dipole m of a
single particle are given by

d = ˜α Eext, m = ˜β Bext + ˜γ Eext

(3)

where Eext and Bext are the externally applied electric and magnetic ﬁelds, ˜α and ˜β are the
electric and magnetic susceptibility tensors of the particle. The cross-susceptibility ˜γ is not
usually included. It is absent for spherical particles and some other symmetric geometries,
and when it is non-zero it vanishes in the low-frequency limit. We will ultimately give a
completely general treatment, showing that the cross-susceptibility makes no contribution
to the absorption, but for simplicity the cross-term will be dropped in the remainder of this
introductory section. The externally applied ﬁelds are assumed to be multiplied by a factor
iωt), and the polarisability tensors are understood to be functions of ω
of the form exp(
with complex valued components, because there may be a phase shift between the applied
ﬁeld and the response. For example, the actual value of the dipole moment at time t is taken
to be d(t) = Re[d exp(

iωt)].

−

These polarisations are detectable at a macroscopic level in various ways: they alter
the dielectric constant and magnetic permeability of the medium in which the particles
are dispersed, and they may also be detected by observing scattering and absorption of
radiation. The polarisability determines two processes which result in the attenuation of
radiation, namely scattering and absorption of energy. Both of these processes can be
characterised conveniently at the microscopic level by calculating the rate of loss of energy
from the incident beam due to interaction with a single particle: this will be denoted by
dE/dt [where X denotes the time average of X(t)]. The two most commonly used measures
and the attenuation
used to quantify these processes are the cross section per particle
coeﬃcient γ. To relate the energy loss to the cross section, note that the energy density in
an electromagnetic wave is 1
2ǫ0E2: the cross section is therefore

where X denotes the time axerage of X(t). The attenuation coeﬃcient γ is deﬁned by the
γz), where I is the intensity at distance z along the beam. The
expression I = I0 exp(
attenuation coeﬃcient is given by γ =

, where
At low frequencies the real part of the polarisability approaches a constant (and the
imaginary part approaches zero). It follows that at suﬃciently low frequencies the scattering
cross section scales as ω4. It will be shown that in the absorption cross section typically scales
as ω2, implying that absorption is expected to be the dominant process at low frequencies.
The absorption of radiation can be related to the imaginary parts of the polarisability
tensors: we will give a careful explanation of this. Electron spin is not signiﬁcant in this
context, and the full Hamiltonian for the electrons is taken to be

The externally applied electric and magnetic ﬁelds are considered to be spatially uniform,
since the particle is small compared to the wavelength of the radiation, we ignore the spatial
dependence of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, and write:

φext(r, t) = e r.Eext,

Aext(r, t) = Bext(t) .

In the case where the circularly symmetric gauge

To facilitate the calculations we will consider ensemble averages of quantities:

if the
electron motion is ergodic, this is the microcanonical average, and in general the ensemble
is deﬁned by the region of phase space explored by the dynamics. Angle brackets will be
used for the appropriate ensemble average. For a general choice of gauge the instananeous

We note that under the assumptions listed above, the absorption is expressed as the sum of
two terms, which are naturally referred to as the electric and magnetic dipole absorption.
Our ﬁnal result will not neglect the magnetic dipole moment which may be induced by the
electric ﬁeld, but we will show that within the framework of our self-consistent approximation
scheme the cross term in (3) makes no contribution to the absorption. The energy absorbed
does not accumulate in the system electronic system: most of it is eventually transformed
into heat by interaction with phonons.

B. Self-consistent ﬁelds

The Hamiltonian will be approximated by an eﬀective Hamiltonian, in which the elec-
trons move independently. The direct interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld via electron spin
can also be neglected, and the eﬀective Hamiltonian is of the form

ˆHeﬀ =

(16)

The response of the system is determined by the interaction of the electrons with the elec-
tric ﬁeld inside the particle, which is described by the eﬀective potentials Aeﬀ and φeﬀ. The
eﬀective potentials are themselves determined by the distribution of charge within the par-
ticle. The external magnetic ﬁeld is also augmented by an induced magnetic ﬁeld which is
produced by the action of the currents which ﬂow in order to establish the electric polarisa-
tion. Provided the particle is suﬃciently small, the induced magnetic ﬁeld can be neglected,
and our self-consistent theory will yield and equation for the electric ﬁeld E(r, ω) within the
particle, which is related to the time-dependent electric ﬁeld as follows:

These are two independent contributions to the the rate of absorption, depending on the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds respectively. It is not obvious that these are correctly identiﬁed
as the electric and magnetic dipole coeﬃcients, because the electric ﬁeld may induce a charge
density with non-zero angular momentum. We will now show that the ﬁrst term is due solely
to the electric dipole. Using the continuity equation and an integration by parts, we ﬁnd

Re(j

Eext) = ω Im(ρ

φext) = ω Im[d.Eext] .

The electrically induced absorption therefore depends only upon the induced dipole moment,
and is independent of the magnetic moment induced by the electric ﬁeld.

III. EQUIVALENCE WITH PERTURBATION THEORY

A. An alternative expression for the the absorption coeﬃcient

In this section, we concentrate on the electric absorption. We describe an alternative
approach to calculating the absorption coeﬃcient, which was used in [4-7], and show that it

We will consider the action of the eﬀective potential φeﬀ(r, t) on the electrons. We
may use either quantum mechanical or classical perturbation theory. We will describe the
quantum mechanical approach, and will use semiclassical approximations: a classical theory
in which quantum mechanics only enters in choosing the Fermi-Dirac distribution for the
initial distribution of electrons gives identical results. Conceptually, the simplest method
for calculating the absorption in the ﬁrst using the Fermi golden rule. This is expressed in
terms of matrix elements φnm of the perturbation in the basis
formed by the eigenstates
of the single-particle eﬀective Hamiltonian, ˆHeﬀ:

The Fermi golden rule states that the rate of transition from an initially occupied state

where the angle brackets denote an average over matrix elements

consider the case where both the temperature and the photon energy are small compared
to other energy scales in the problem; generalisations are straightforward. Absorption of
energy occurs due to the excitation of electrons in occupied states below the Fermi level to
n¯hω,
empty states above the Fermi level. The number of states which can be excited is
and the energy absorbed in each transition is ¯hω: the total rate of absorption of energy is
given by multiplying these factors by the transition rate R, giving

n = νV , where V is the volume of the particle. Substituting this into (39) reproduces (47),
thus establishing its equivalence to (42).

B. General relation between polarisability and the propagator

We will now relate the polarisability operator Π(r, r′; ω) to the probability propagator
P (r, r′; t), which is the probability that an electron, released at r′ with energy equal to
the Fermi energy EF, will be at position r after time t. The discussion will be classical; a
quantum mechanical derivation proceeds along similar lines.

Let the phase-space distribution be f (r, p; t): this will, when convenient, be written

f (α, t) where α = (r, p). The Hamiltonian will be assumed to be of the form

H(α, t) = H0(α) + X(t)H1(α)

where we will be interested in the case where H0 = p2/2m + V (r) and H1 = φ(r). The
perturbation parameter X(t) is assumed to be small, so that f (α, t) may be expanded as a
series in X(t): we will be interested in the expansion as far as the ﬁrst order term:

f (α, t) = f0(α) +

dt′ X(t′) g(α, t, t′) + O(X 2) .

Substituting into the Liouville equation, ∂tf =

and the bulk conductivity σ(ω) may, in the case of diﬀusive electron motion, be approximated

where D is the diﬀusion constant, and m the electron eﬀective mass. In the case of ballistic

Next we consider the polarisation charge close to the boundary of the particle. Here we

an adequate approximation, but our discussion of the high frequency case assumed that the
conductivity could be approximated as that of a homogeneous system. Another reason for
discussing the boundary separately is that we expect that the polarisation charge density
may have a singularity there.

≫

We may assume that for ω

ωc the polarisability operator is short ranged. A smooth
boundary may therefore be approximated locally by a ﬂat surface, z = 0 in some local Carte-
sian coordinates. The polarisability is given by (53), and we approximate the propagator
from r′ = (x′, y′, z′) to r = (x, y, z) by the sum of a direct contribution and a contribution
originating from an image source at r′

z′), so that

The charge charge density is concentrated in a narrow layer at the surface, and may typically
be approximated by writing

ρ(r) = ρs(z)K(S)

where S labels points on the boundary, and z is a coordinate normal to the boundary. In this
case, the potential in the neighbourhood of the boundary is of the form φ(r) = φs(z)K(S),

D. Diﬀusive electron motion

In the diﬀusive case, it is possible to write a useful eigenfunction expansion for the
linear response functions: for t > 0 the propagator P (r, r′; t) satisﬁes the diﬀusion equation

V. THE SELF-CONSISTENT FIELD

A. Approximate equations for the self-consistent ﬁelds

Here we discuss how the solution of the self-consistent equations can be greatly simpliﬁed
by the use of ‘semiclassical’ approximations. We consider the electric dipole absorption ﬁrst.
Calculation of the electric dipole absorption coeﬃcient via either (39) or (47) requires

the self-consistent ﬁelds φeﬀ(r, ω), which is given by equation (32):

φext) = [ ˆI

ˆU ˆΠ(ω)]
|

−

φeﬀ) .

|

(77)

ˆU ˆΠ(ω): this
Formally, solution of this equation requires calculation of the inverse of ˆI
could be done explicitly in a numerical calculation by expanding in a suitable basis set. We
will aim instead for an approximate analytic solution. For frequencies small compared to
the plasma frequency ωp, the external electric ﬁeld is ‘screened’ by polarisation charges, so
that the internal ﬁeld is much smaller than the externally applied ﬁeld. The key physical
intuition is that the external electric ﬁeld is almost exactly cancelled by the electric ﬁeld due
to the induced charge density ρ(r). Let ρcl(r) be the charge density induced on the particle
by a static external ﬁeld, according to classical electrodynamics: this charge density gives an
induced electric ﬁeld which precisely cancels the externally applied ﬁeld inside the particle.
For frequencies small compared to the plasma frequency, the induced charge density is well
approximated by ρcl(r): we will assume that

−

ρ) =

ρcl) + O(ω/ωp) + O(a/a0)

|

|

where a is the characteristic dimension of the particle, and a0 is the Bohr radius. The
classical charge distribution formally satisﬁes an equation analogous to (77), in which the
term representing the internal ﬁeld

potential φ: at zero frequency, the induced charge density is ˆΠφ = eνφ, and for a particle
of characteristic dimension a in d dimensions, the induced charge may be approximated
ρad, with separation a: this results in
by a dipole formed by charges of magnitude Q

This is simply a linearised Thomas-Fermi approximation [12]. The semiclassical approxima-

An interpretation of the dynamic potential is that it moves the polarisation charge into

Close to the boundary (89) is not necessarily a good approximation to the eﬀective
potential. One reason is that the approximations underlying (72) fail, and the polarisation
ρcl) has a

To summarise, the following picture emerges. For low frequencies, ω

ωc the potential
is approximately φstat(r). At high frequencies, ω

by φdyn(r) within the interior of the particle. In the vicinity of the boundary, the potential

VI. DISCUSSION: CALCULATION OF THE ABSORPTION COEFFICIENT

ˆP (ω)

Once an adequate approximation for the eﬀective potential has been obtained, the elec-
tric absorption coeﬃcient is obtained from (47): the absorption coeﬃcient is proportional
to ω2(φ
φ). Previous papers [4-8] have discussed methods for the evaluation of the
absorption coeﬃcient using equation (47) in some detail, for speciﬁc cases. This paper has
presented a general approach to the determining of the eﬀective potential, and some remarks
on applying this to calculating the absorption coeﬃcient may be useful.

|

|

When the electron motion is diﬀusive, the absorption is very easily evaluated using (90)
and (76). It is found that the coeﬃcient is proportional to ω2, and that (at least within the
framework of the approximations used in section V) the frequency scale ωc plays no role.
The absorption coeﬃcient can be shown to be exactly equal to the classical value in this
case [7,5].

|

|

φ) approaches a non-zero limit as ω

The case of ballistic electron motion is more diﬃcult. It might be expected that Cφφ(ω) =
ˆP (ω)
(φ
0, implying that the absorption coeﬃcient
→
is proportional to ω2 for low frequencies. This expectation is correct for cases where the
electron motion is ergodic (the most important cases being diﬀusive electron motion, and
the ballistic case with a rough boundary). In the case of integrable electron motion, which
can be realised experimentally if the boundary appears smooth on the scale of the Fermi
wavelength, Cφφ(ω) typically approaches zero as ω
0 in a non-analytic fashion. In the
important special case of particles with circular symmetry, Cφφ(ω) is zero for ω < ωc,
where ωc is the frequency of a glancing circular orbit. Thus the electron dynamics plays an
important role in determining the low frequency absorption.

→

The high frequency absorption, by contrast, is determined by the nature of the singu-
larities of the function f (t) = φ(rt), which can result from singularities in the motion r(t),
or in the potential φ(r). We will discuss the ballistic case. The dominant contribution
comes from the singularities of φ(r) in the neighbourhood of the boundary. The absorption
coeﬃcient was calculated in [4] and [6] for the three dimensional and two dimensional cases
respectively, assuming that the eﬀective potential is equal to φstat(r). In three dimensions,
this potential is a delta function singularity concentrated on the boundary, and in two di-
mensions it diverges as z−1/2, where z is the normal distance from the boundary. These
ω−1 in two

forms for the potential imply that (φ
dimensions. In [4] and [6] it was predicted that in the case of particles with circular sym-
metry, the absorption coeﬃcient shows a sequence of resonances superposed on a regular
contribution increasing as ω2 and ω for three and two dimensions respectively.

The more sophisticated approach introduced in this paper indicates that the potential
φ) should satisfy (80), whereas the potential used in [4], [6] was simply the static potential,
|
φstat). We must discuss the extent to which this reﬁnement will
satisfying
change the results. In section V B we argued that the singularities of the eﬀective potential
at the boundary are the same as those of the ‘static’ potential. We can therefore hypothesise
that the more reﬁned theory would make a quantitative rather than qualitative diﬀerence
to the results. This issue will be addressed in a subsequent paper, which will consider the
inversion of (75) to determine the potential φs(z) from the charge density ρs(z), and its use
to estimate the high frequency absorption coeﬃcient.

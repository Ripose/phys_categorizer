Abstract

New, gauge-independent, second-order Lagrangian for the motion of classical,
charged test particles is used to derive the corresponding Hamiltonian formulation.
For this purpose a Hamiltonian description of theories derived from the second-order
Lagrangian is presented. Unlike in the standard approach, the canonical momenta
arising here are explicitely gauge-invariant and have a clear physical interpretation.
The reduced symplectic form obtained this way is equivalent to Souriau’s form.
This approach illustrates a new method of deriving equations of motion from ﬁeld
equation.

1 Introduction

In [1] a new method of deriving equations of motion from ﬁeld equations was proposed.
The method is based on an analysis of the geometric structure of generators of the Poincar´e
group and may by applied to any special-relativistic, lagrangian ﬁeld theory. In the case
of classical electrodynamics, this method leads uniquely to a manifestly gauge-invariant,
second order Lagrangian

for the motion of charged test particles:

and aµ := uν
∇νuµ is the particle’s acceleration (we use the Heaviside-Lorentz system
of units with the velocity of light c = 1). The skew-symmetric tensor M int
µν (t, q, v) is
equal to the amount of the angular-momentum of the ﬁeld, which is acquired by our
physical system, when the Coulomb ﬁeld accompanying the particle moving with velocity
v through the space-time point (t, q), is added to the background (external) ﬁeld. More
precisely: the total energy-momentum tensor corresponding to the sum of the background
ﬁeld fµν and the above Coulomb ﬁeld decomposes in a natural way into a sum of 1) terms
quadratic in the background ﬁeld, 2) terms quadratic in the Coulomb ﬁeld 3) mixed terms.
The quantity M int
µν is equal to this part of the total angular-momentum Mµν, which we
obtain integrating only the mixed terms of the energy-momentum tensor.

The above result is a by-product of a consistent theory of interacting particles and

ﬁelds (cf. [2], [3]), called Electrodynamics of Moving Particles.

We have proved in [1] that the new Lagrangian (1) diﬀers from the standard one

L = Lparticle + Lint =

−

by (gauge-dependent) boundary corrections only. Therefore, both Lagrangians generate
the same equations of motion for test particles in an external ﬁeld. In the present pa-
per we explicitly derive these equations and construct the gauge-invariant Hamiltonian
description of this theory.

Standard Hamiltonian formalism, based on the gauge-dependent Lagrangian (3), leads

to the gauge-dependent Hamiltonian

H(t, q, p) =

m2 + (p + eA(t, q))2 + eA0(t, q) ,

q
where the gauge-dependent quantity

pk := pkin

k −

eAk(t, q) = muk −

eAk(t, q)

plays role of the momentum canonically conjugate to the particle’s position qk.

As was observed by Souriau (see [5]), we may replace the above non-physical momen-
tum in the description of the phase space of this theory by the gauge-invariant quantity
pkin. The price we pay for this change is, that the canonical contact form, corresponding
to the theory of free particles:

Ω = dpkin

dqµ ,

µ ∧

has to be replaced by its deformation:

ΩS := Ω

e fµν dqµ

dqν ,

−
where e is the particle’s charge.

∧

Both Ω and ΩS are deﬁned on the “mass-shell” of the kinetic momentum, i. e. on
the surface (pkin)2 =
m2 in the cotangent bundle T ∗M over the space-time M (we

whose tangent vectors belong to the degeneracy distribution of Ω. Souriau noticed that
replacing (6) by its deformation (7) we obtain the theory of motion of the particle in a
given electromagnetic ﬁeld fµν.

The new approach, proposed in the present paper is based on Lagrangian (1). It leads
directly to a perfectly gauge-invariant Hamiltonian, having a clear physical interpretation
as the sum of two terms: 1) kinetic energy mu0 and 2) “interaction energy” equal to the
ammount of ﬁeld energy acquired by our physical system, when the particle’s Coulomb
ﬁeld is added to the background ﬁeld.

When formulated in terms of contact geometry, our approach leads uniquely to a new

form ΩN :

Theorem 1 The one dimensional degeneracies of the form ΩN restricted to the particle’s
“mass-shell” correspond to the trajectories of a test particle moving in external electro-
magnetic ﬁeld.

It is easy to see that both ΩS and ΩN , although diﬀerent, have the same degeneracy
vectors, because h and f give the same value on the velocity vector uν:

uνhµν = uνfµν .

Hence, both deﬁne the same equations of motion. We stress, however, that our ΩN is
uniquely obtained from the gauge-invariant Lagrangian (1) via the Legendre transforma-
tion.

The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we sketch brieﬂy the (relatively little
known) Hamiltonian formulation of theories arising from the second order Lagrangian.

theory

Consider a theory described by the 2-nd order lagrangian L = L(qi, ˙qi, ¨qi) (to simplify
the notation we will skip the index “i” corresponding to diﬀerent degrees of freedom qi;
extension of this approach to higher order Lagrangians is straightforward). Introducing
auxiliary variables v = ˙q we can treat our theory as a 1-st order one with lagrangian

generated by the following relation:

−

v = 0 on the space of lagrangian variables (q, ˙q, v, ˙v). Dynamics is

(p dq + π dv) = ˙p dq + p d ˙q + ˙π dv + π d ˙v .

(11)

where (p, π) are momenta canonically conjugate to q and v respectively. Because L is
deﬁned only on the constraint submanifold, its derivative dL is not uniquely deﬁned and
has to be understood as a collection of all the covectors which are compatible with the
derivative of the function along constraints. This means that the left hand side is deﬁned
up to µ( ˙q
v), where µ are Lagrange multipliers corresponding to constraints φ = 0 .
We conclude that p = µ is an arbitrary covector and (11) is equivalent to the system of

3 Equations of motion from the variational principle

In this section we explicitly derive the particle’s equations of motion from the variational
principle based on the gauge-invariant Lagrangian (1). The Euler-Lagrange equations for
a second order Lagrangian theory are given by

ﬁelds, the energy-momentum tensor T total of the total ﬁeld

µν

:= fµν + f (y,u)

µν

may be decomposed into three terms: the energy-momentum tensor of the background
ﬁeld T f ield, the Coulomb energy-momentum tensor T particle, which is composed of terms
quadratic in f (y,u)

and the “interaction tensor” T int, containing mixed terms:

µν

T total = T f ield + T particle + T int .

Interaction quantities (labelled with “int”) are those obtained by integrating appropriate
components of T int. Because all the three tensors are conserved outside of the sources
(i. e. outside of two trajectories: the actual trajectory of our particle and the straight
line passing through the space-time point y with four-velocity u), the integration gives
the same result when performed over any asymptoticaly ﬂat Cauchy 3-surface passing
through y.

In particular, rint and sint may be written in terms of the laboratory-frame components

of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds as follows:

rint

To prove this relation let us observe that in the particle’s rest-frame (see the Appendix

translated to the language of laboratory frame, this is precisely equivalent to the above
relation.

formulae (29) – (30) for the particle’s Coulomb ﬁeld.

also on particle’s acceleration. Hovewer, using (27) one easily shows that due to the

[1] that pint

It is a sum of two terms: kinetic momentum pkin

By Hamiltonian formulation of the theory we understand, usually, the phase space of
dq and
Hamiltonian variables
the Hamilton function H (Hamiltonian) deﬁned on
. This function is interpreted as
an energy of the system. However, for time-dependent systems this framework is usually
replaced by (a slightly more natural) formulation in terms of a contact form. For this

Observe, that the 2-form (51) has the same structure as the Souriau’s 2-form (7).
They diﬀer by the “curvature” 2-forms f and h only. However, the diﬀerence “h

vanishes identically along the particle’s trajectories due to the fact that both fµν and hµν
have the same projections in the direction of uµ (see formula (10)). We conclude that the

We have two diﬀerent contact structures which have the same characteristic bundles.

Therefore, from the physical point of view, these forms are completely equivalent.

Appendix

Due to the complicated dependence of the Coulomb ﬁeld D0 and B0 on the particle’s
position q and velocity v, formulae containing the respective derivatives of these ﬁelds
are rather complex. To simplify the proofs, we shall use for calculations the particle’s
rest-frame, instead of the laboratory frame. The frame associated with a particle moving
along a trajectory ζ may be deﬁned as follows (cf. [3], [1]): at each point (t, q(t))
ζ we
take the 3-dimensional hyperplane Σt orthogonal to the four-velocity uµ (the rest-frame
hypersurface). We parametrize Σt by cartesian coordinates (xk), k = 1, 2, 3, centered at

∈

10

the particle’s position (i.e. the point xk = 0 belongs always to ζ). Obviously, there are
inﬁnitely many such coordinate systems on Σt, which diﬀer from each other by an O(3)-
rotation. To ﬁx uniquely coordinates (xk), we choose the unique boost transformation
relating the laboratory time axis ∂/∂y0 with the four-velocity vector U := uµ ∂
∂yµ . Next,
we deﬁne the position of the ∂/∂xk – axis on Σt by transforming the corresponding ∂/∂yk
– axis of the laboratory frame by the same boost. The ﬁnal formula relating Minkowskian
coordinates (yµ) with the new parameters (t, xk) may be easily calculated (see e. g. [3])
from the above deﬁnition:

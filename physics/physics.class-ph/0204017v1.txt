Complex Space-localized Fields
Interacting with Electromagnetic Fields

Theodore Bodurov

Several families of nonlinear ﬁeld equations are known to possess space-localized
singularity-free solutions which describe ﬁelds with ﬁnite Hermitian norms. This paper
studies the interaction of such ﬁelds ψ with given electromagnetic potentials Aµ entering
the ﬁeld’s equations through the covariant derivative forms ∂µψ − gAµψ . The main
result is: the motion of a space-localized ﬁeld, as a whole, is essentially identical to that
of a point charge moving in the same electromagnetic potentials, if this ﬁeld is a solution
either to a nonlinear Schr¨odinger or to a nonlinear Dirac equation, under some very gen-
eral and physically meaningful assumptions. Using an alternative method, similar result
is shown to hold for a very wide class of nonlinear ﬁeld equations. All of these establish a
new connection between nonlinear ﬁeld theory, on one hand, and classical electrodynamics
and quantum mechanics, on the other.

1. Introduction

Since the well known work of Lorentz and Abraham on the spatially extended electron
several types of space-localized ﬁelds (under various names) and their possible role in
particle/ﬁeld theory have been studied by many physicists. Among the most prominent
are: L. de Broglie [1], W. Heisenberg [2], T. D. Lee [3, 4], N. Rosen [5, 6]. . .

Our interest in the dynamics of space-localized ﬁelds, considered as discrete entities,
is due primarily to the novel link which it establishes between nonlinear ﬁeld theories, on
one hand, and classical electrodynamics and quantum mechanics, on the other. In this
respect the present paper is closely related to an earlier paper [7] by the same author.

Here we study the global dynamics of space-localized complex-valued multi-component
ﬁelds which are solutions to a large class of nonlinear wave equations. In these equations,
which are derivable from Lagrangian densities, the coordinates and the time enter explicitly
only via the covariant derivative forms ∂ψ/∂xµ + iUµ(x)ψ , where Uµ(x) are known real-
valued functions of the time and space coordinates xµ , µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 . Section 3 derives
the dynamics of a space-localized ﬁeld, as a single entity, when it is a solution to a nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equation modiﬁed with the substitutions

∂
∂xµ →

∂
∂xµ − igAµ , µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 ,

(1.1)

where g is a real constant and Aµ is the 4-potential of a given electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Section 4 presents the same derivations in the case when the localized ﬁeld is a solution

to a nonlinear Dirac equation modiﬁed with (1.1). The derivations and the results in
these sections are new. They show that the center of the ﬁeld’s region of localization
moves as a classical point charge would move in the same electromagnetic ﬁeld (given by
Aµ(x) ) provided the latter’s variation within the localization region is suﬃciently small.
Section 5 demonstrates that these results are very general by deriving them (using an
alternative method) from three physically natural assumptions but without assuming that
the nonlinear ﬁeld equation is of a particular type.

N. Rosen [5] (page 98) appears to be the ﬁrst who has inferred, without giving any
derivation, a similar result by considering the energy of a space-localized ﬁeld obeying a
speciﬁc gauge invariant wave equation. Much latter, Bialynicki-Birula and J. Mycielski
[8] investigating a nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation with a logarithmic nonlinear term found
that this equation admits closed-form exact localized solutions, which they called gaussons.
In the same paper they have demonstrated that if their Logarithmic NLS equation is
modiﬁed with the substitution (1.1) then “...in every electromagnetic ﬁeld, suﬃciently
small gaussons move like (charged) classical particles.”

Notation and conventions: Here, all complex-valued ﬁelds will be denoted with
the Greek letters ψ , ϕ and η , all densities (the integrands of functionals) with script
capital letters, all 3-vectors with bold letters. Latin indeces will be used for the ﬁeld’s
components and for the space coordinates. Greek indeces will be used for space-time
components. The complex conjugate of any ﬁeld ψ will be written as ψ∗ . The rest of the
symbols will be deﬁned at their ﬁrst appearance. The summation convention of repeated
indexes is assumed as usual. The domain of all space integrals is the entire 3-dimensional
Euclidian space lR

. The units are selected so that

c = 1 .

2. The assumptions

Both for clarity and for preciseness the meaning of the term space-localized , as used

in this paper, will be given by the following:

Deﬁnition 2.1. A scalar, vector or spinor-valued function ψ = (ψ1 , . . . , ψs) whose
components ψk = ψk(x, t) are functions of the coordinates x = (x1, x2, x3) and possibly
the time t will be called space-localized, or ψ-ﬁeld, if its Hermitian norm

N = hψ, ψi =

k ψk d 3x ,
ψ∗

k = 1, . . . , s

(2.1)

Z
lR3

is ﬁnite and if

b < maxx |ψk| < ∞ , with b > 0 a constant, for all

t > 0 .

All functionals which appear in this paper are assumed to be ﬁnite when evaluated

with a space-localized ﬁeld.

It is known that wave equations in 3 space-dimensions which do not depend on x
explicitly may possess space-localized solutions only if they are nonlinear . Wave packets
are not localized ﬁelds since they dissipate in time, i.e., for them b = 0 . We will
assume that in a ψ-ﬁeld there is only a single region of localization, or that if several
such regions are present they are separated by distances which are much larger than their

2

Complex Space-localized Fields

Bodurov

characteristic dimensions. Such an assumption will not diminish the generality of the
following derivations, but it will allow us to focus on the key question: How is the motion
of the localization region of ψ determined by a given external ﬁeld, i.e., by the explicit
dependence of the ψ wave equation on x and t ?

When the ψ-ﬁeld equations are obtained from a Lagrangian density L and certain
assumptions are met it is possible to derive either from the ﬁeld equations (Sec. 3 and
4) or solely from the Lagrangian density L (Sec. 5) the diﬀerential equations which the
In essence, the ﬁrst

assumption is: The external potentials enter the nonlinear ﬁeld equations exactly as the
electromagnetic potentials enter the fundamental equations of quantum mechanics.

of the “center” of localization satisfy.

ri = ri(t)

Assumption 2.1. The explicit dependence, when present, of the Lagrangian density

L = L(ψ∗, ψ, ∂ψ∗, ∂ψ, t, x) = L(ψ∗, ψ, η∗, η)

(2.2)

on the coordinates xi and on the time t = x0 is only through the forms η = {ηkµ} :

ηkµ =

∂ψk
∂xµ + iUµ ψk ,

k = 1, . . . , s ; µ = 0, 1, 2, 3

(2.3)

where Uµ = Uµ(x, t) are given real-valued functions, ψ may be a spinor ﬁeld, a vector
ﬁeld, or just a set of coupled scalar ﬁelds, ∂ψ stands for the set of all space and time
derivatives ∂µψk = ∂ψk/∂xµ . The behavior of Uµ and that of the ﬁeld components ψk
under rotations in 3 and 4-space are left undetermined in order to maintain generality.
However, the ﬁeld equations obtained from (2.2) must be Galilei or Lorentz invariant.

The above assumption raises the following question: If a nonlinear wave equation
possesses a space-localized solution, will it possess such a solution after it is modiﬁed with
the substitution (1.1)? This question is answered at the end of this section.

Assumption 2.2. The functions Uµ(x, t) are arbitrary except that the magnitudes
of their variations |△Uµ| within a localization region are suﬃciently small, so that within
such a region Uµ may be treated as being constant.

A criterion for “when are the variations |△Uµ| suﬃciently small” is given at the end

of Section 5.

Assumption 2.3. The Lagrangian density L(ψ∗, ψ, ∂ψ∗, ∂ψ) obtained from (2.2)

by setting Uµ = 0 in (2.3) is gauge type I invariant, that is, the transformation

k = eiε ψk ,
ψ′

k = e−iε ψ∗
ψ′∗
k

(2.4)

with real parameter ε (which does not depend on x or on t ) preserves the value of L .
Here, the term “gauge type I transformation” is used as in Goldstein [9] (page 593) to

distinguish from the gauge transformations of the electromagnetic potentials.

Assumption 2.3 is a natural extension of a fundamental property of Schr¨odinger and

Dirac equations to the nonlinear ﬁeld equations, considered in this paper.

When Assumption 2.3 holds it follows from Noether’s theorem that there exist a
conserved density Q and a corresponding ﬂux density F = (F 1, F 2, F 3) associated with
any L of the form (2.2) and given by

where ηk0 , ηki are deﬁned by (2.3) and ψ is a solution of the ﬁeld equation derived from
L . In view of the critical role which the expressions (2.5) play here, we will sketch an
alternative derivation which does not rely on Noether’s theorem.

Let L ′ = L(ψ′∗, ψ′, η′∗, η′) be the Lagrangian obtained from (2.2) by transforming

the ψ-ﬁeld according to (2.4). Then, the invariance condition is

In what follows we will need a variable r = (r1, r2, r3) ∈ lR

which gives the position
of the localized ψ-ﬁeld as a whole. This variable is deﬁned, just as the position of any
distribution, with the functionals

ri =

Q xi d 3x ,

with

Q =

Q d 3x ,

i = 1, 2, 3

(2.9)

Q Z

where Q is given by (2.5) and Q is a constant of the motion according to (2.8). The
values of the functionals ri are functions of t only and may be regarded as the coordinates
of the “center” of the localization region. No probabilistic interpretation will be imposed
on the density Q , or on any other density, since here such would be entirely unnecessary.
The integral in (2.9) for ri is normalized by dividing it with Q since the ψ-ﬁeld, being a
solution of a nonlinear equation in general, will not remain a solution if it is normalized.
The curve r = r(t) will be called trajectory of the localization region.

If a “free” wave equation obtained from the Lagrangian (2.2) with Uµ = 0 possesses
a localized solution, when Uµ are arbitrary functions no localized solution will exist, in
general. However, if Uµ are strictly constant, but otherwise arbitrary, within the space
occupied by the ψ-ﬁeld then a localized solution will certainly exist. To see this, apply to
the Lagrangian (2.2) the transformation ψ′
(not a
Gauge type I transformation), where all Uµ = const . Then, observing that the forms

we apply Assumption 2.3 (for which the dependence of θ on x and t is now irrelevant)
to obtain the equality

L(ψ∗, ψ, η∗, η) = L(eiθψ′∗, e−iθψ′, eiθ∂ψ′∗, e−iθ∂ψ′) = L(ψ′∗, ψ′, ∂ψ′∗, ∂ψ′) .

k = exp(iθ) ψk

This shows that if we set Uµ = 0
in the equations for ψ (but not in θ ) we get the
equations for ψ′ . Recognizing that the Hermitian norm of ψ is not aﬀected by the
transformation ψ′

the above claim follows.
Now, continuity considerations lead us to conclude that even when Uµ are not strictly
constant the localized solution will still exist, as long as the variation’s magnitudes
|△Uµ|
within the region of localization remain smaller than a certain critical value k1 . This is
one reason for having Assumption 2.2. The second reason is that a Lagrangian function
for the coordinates ri(t) can be deﬁned, as we will see in Section 5, only when |△Uµ|
is
smaller than some other limit value k2 . It may be argued that k1 = k2 , but for our
purposes this is not needed.

for the scalar-valued ﬁeld ψ . The various constants which appear in Schr¨odinger equation
proper have been retained in (3.1), so that a comparison with certain results from QM
can be made most conveniently. It is known that there are functions G = G(ψ∗ψ) with
which (3.1) possesses space-localized solutions. For the existence conditions and the proofs
see Berestycki and Lions [12].

It is most remarkable that the nonlinear term G(ψ∗ψ) of the NLS equation does not
enter in the above equation. Hence, we would have gotten exactly the same result had
we taken ψ to be a solution of the Schr¨odinger equation proper ( G ≡ 0 ). However, the

(3.9)

derivation of equation (3.10) is valid only if ψ is a space-localized ﬁeld. But, in quantum
mechanics the only space-localized ﬁelds are the bound states in some potential well, and
so, the “center” coordinates r (3.4) of any such bound state are ﬁxed by the potential
well location. The wave packets of QM are not localized ﬁelds, as explained in Section 2.
Thus, the question “what is the motion of a localized ﬁeld as a whole?” is not meaningful
in quantum mechanics.

For the space-localized solutions of a NLS equation the above question is certainly
meaningful. Its answer would follow immediately from (3.10) had we assumed that the
variations of the ﬁelds E , B , instead of those of the potentials Φ , A , are negligible
within the localization region. (Why Assumption 2.2 was chosen to restrict the potentials
and not the ﬁelds intensities will become clear in Section 5.) The equations r = r(t)
for
the motion of the localization center do follow from equation (3.10) and Assumption 2.2
but the reasoning is not entirely straight forwarded: We change the integration variable x
to x′ according to x = x′ + r , where r is given by (3.4). Then, the ﬁrst term in (3.10)
becomes (with the abbreviations Φ(x) ≡ Φ(x, t) and A(x) ≡ A(x, t) )

Now let ψ = (ψ1 , . . . , ψ4) be a 4-spinor ﬁeld which satisﬁes a nonlinear Dirac (NLD)

equation of the form

where M1 = M1(s1 , s2) and M2 = M2(s1 , s2) are scalar real-valued functions of the
scalar and pseudo-scalar quantities

s1 = ¯ψ ψ

and

s2 = ¯ψ γ 5ψ

( ¯ψ = ψ†γ 0 ) .

(4.2)

As explained in Section 2, all wave equations considered in the present paper must be
derivable from a Lagrangian density. If one takes for the above two functions:

and

M2 =

(4.3)

then, the real-valued Lagrangian density from which (4.1) is obtained has the form

else. It is known that, with certain M , (4.1) possesses space-localized solutions: Cazenave
and Vazquez [13], Soler [14]. Additional references may be found in both of this works.

When external EM potentials Φ = −A0 , A = (A1, A2, A3) are present the equation
(4.1) is modiﬁed with the substitution (1.1), according to Assumption 2.1. Space-localized
solutions will exist if the original equation (4.1) possesses such solutions and if Assumption
2.2 is met (by the argument discussed at the end of Section 2). Equation (4.1) thus modiﬁed
and written as a Hamiltonian evolution equation becomes

The various constants in equation (4.5) are written just as they appear in its linear version
so that a comparison with certain results in Dirac’s theory can be made most conveniently.
We do the substitution (1.1) in the Lagrangian (4.4) and insert the result into the expres-
sions (2.5). Then it follows that the norm N , given by (2.1), is a constant of the motion
as it is in the linear case.

which is the same as the expectation value of the velocity operator α in Dirac’s theory
because the function M , as a multiplication operator, obviously commutes with xi .

In the non-relativistic case the “mechanical” momentum of a space-localized ﬁeld is
obtained, of course, from the velocity functional (3.5) by multiplying it with the mass m .
In Dirac’s theory one takes for the “mechanical” momentum exactly the same functional,
except in it ψ is a spinor-valued ﬁeld. Here we do the same, i.e., we take

which is valid for the nonlinear Dirac equations (4.5), as well as for the Dirac equation
proper. This is so because the integral (4.13), involving the nonlinearity M , is zero.

Assumption 2.2 was not needed for the derivation of (4.14). Now, if we assume that
the variations of Φ and A are suﬃciently small within the localization region, i.e., if
Assumption 2.2 holds, then the electromagnetic ﬁelds E , B may be treated as being
constant in that region, as it was shown in Section 3. Hence, (4.14) becomes

where v = dr/dt , given by (4.8), is the velocity of the localization region “center”.
Equation (4.15) describes the motion of the localization region r = r(t)
in complete
agreement with the result (3.13) of Section 3.

Again, one recognizes this to be precisely the equation of motion for a point charge q

but this time in the relativistic case (Goldstein [9] Sec. 7.8, Jackson [10] Sec. 12.1).

5. The Lagrangian function for the motion of a localized ﬁeld

The results in the previous two sections are valid for entire families of NLS and NLD
equations which possess space-localized solutions. Thus, the question arises: Is it possible
to derive similar results without assuming a particular type for the ﬁeld equations? This
section will show that it is possible, but the method has to be diﬀerent since one cannot
calculate explicitely the time-derivatives of the functionals r nor of v without knowing the
ﬁeld equations. Instead, we will derive from the assumptions in Section 2 the general form
of the Lagrangian function for the motion of a space-localized ﬁeld, i.e., for the coordinates
r = (r1, r2, r3)
of the localization center. Then, several important conclusions will be
drawn from the form of this Lagrangian function.

the variations

When Assumption 2.2 holds, i.e.

of the given potentials
Uµ are suﬃciently small within the localization region, the value of the space integral of
the Lagrangian density (2.2) may be approximated by replacing in the latter the actual
potentials Uµ(x, t) with their values Uµ(r, t) at the localization “center” r . This is so
because L → 0 outside the localization region. Then, at a ﬁxed time t and for a ﬁxed
space-localized ψ(x, t) the Lagrangian functional

d 3x

(cid:1)

becomes a function of Uµ . Alternatively, one can regard (5.1) as a functional of ψ and ψ∗
in which Uµ enter as parameters. At the end of this section it is shown that the error in
this approximation can be made arbitrarily small by choosing potentials whose variations
within the localization region are suﬃciently small, i.e.,

|△U0| + |vi| · |△Ui| ≪ |L/Q| .

The function L(U ) deﬁned by (5.1) is diﬀerent, of course, for diﬀerent ψ . Our goal is
to derive a relationship between L and Uµ which remains valid during the entire motion
of a particular ψ as long as ψ remains space-localized. To do this we diﬀerentiate (5.1)

10

with respect to Uµ . Because of Assumption 2.2 it is permissible to diﬀerentiate under
the integral sign which produces

This is yet another functional of ψ in which Uµ enter as parameters. However, if ψ is
a space-localized solution of the ﬁeld equations (2.7), derived from the same Lagrangian
density L(ψ∗, ψ, η∗, η) , and Uµ are the values of the potentials at the region of localiza-
tion, then, the integrands in (5.2) are precisely the conserved density −Q and the three
components of the ﬂux density −F i as given by (2.5).

Thus, when (5.2) is evaluated on a solution for µ = 0 we have that

holds during (and only during) the motion, where the quantity Q is a constant during
the same motion according to (2.8). Of course, the value of Q is determined by the initial
conditions of the particular solution and so Q will be diﬀerent for diﬀerent solutions ψ .
Again, when (5.2) is evaluated on a solution but now for µ = i = 1, 2, 3 we have

Z
Next, the velocity v = (v1, v2, v3) of the localization region is expressed in terms of Q
and F i as follows: We diﬀerentiate the position functionals ri in (2.9) with respect to t

yields a relation which holds for the entire motion

i = 1, 2, 3 .

Let us now consider the motion of the localization region of a solution ψ = ψ(x, t) ,
assumed to be known, of some nonlinear ﬁeld equation. We can ﬁnd the exact trajectory of
the localization region r = r(t) by inserting this solution into the functionals (2.9). At
any point r(t) on this trajectory the quantities U0 = U0(r, t) and Ui = Ui(r, t) which
appear in (5.3) and (5.6) are well deﬁned and known, since Uµ(x, t) are given functions.
Furthermore, the velocity v(t) = dr(t)/dt is well deﬁned and known, since r(t) is known.
of the variables U0 , Ui , vk (i, k = 1, 2, 3)
We want to ﬁnd a function L = L(U, v)
such that the equations (5.3) and (5.6) are satisﬁed during the motion, i.e. at each point
of the trajectory r = r(t) . The unique solution of this system of 4 equations, obtained
by four consecutive (trivial) integrations with respect to U0 , U1 , U2 and U3 , is

L = − Q

U0 + Ui vi

where L(0, v) depends on vi but not on Uµ and may be regarded as the integration
“constant”. One can verify the expression (5.7) by inserting it in (5.3) and (5.6).

It remains to convince ourselves that L given by (5.7) is the Lagrangian function for

the trajectory r = r(t) . This is done by restating (5.7) as

L(ψ∗, ψ, η∗, η) d 3x = L(0, v) − Q(U0 + Ui vi)

(5.8)

and integrating both sides with respect to time from t1 to t2 . Thus, within the error of
the approximation the equation

(cid:1)

holds on space-localized solutions ψ(x, t) . Moreover, this equation holds also for all space-
localized functions ˜ψ(x, t) which satisfy the conservation law (2.8) and Assumption 2.2,
because for such functions (5.8) holds as already shown. Pertinent remarks:
(a) ˜ψ will be called the varied ﬁeld if it is suﬃciently close in norm to a solution ψ .
(b) ˜ψ is restricted to be a space-localized ﬁeld since otherwise the Lagrangian functional
L d 3x when evaluated with ˜ψ will be divergent, in general, and L will be meaningless.
(c) The varied ﬁeld ˜ψ must be such that it represents a particle whose trajectory is varied,
R
but not its properties like mass, charge, etc. Hence, the variations are restricted so that ˜ψ
satisﬁes the conservation law (2.8) and Assumption 2.2. Consequently, Q in (2.9) remains
a constant of the motion (which is not varied).
(d) The functions U0(x, t) and Ui(x, t) are not varied — they are given.

According to the calculus of variations, ˜ψ(x, t) is varied so that its values ˜ψ(x, t1)
at t1 and ˜ψ(x, t2) at t2 remain ﬁxed, i.e.
˜ψ(x, t1) = ψ(x, t1) and ˜ψ(x, t2) = ψ(x, t2) .
Inserting the varied ˜ψ into the expressions (2.5) and the result — into (2.9) one ﬁnds the
varied trajectory ˜r = ˜r(t) . Thus, by varying the localized ﬁeld ˜ψ we vary the trajectory.
Moreover, since the functions ˜ψ(x, t1) and ˜ψ(x, t2) are ﬁxed it follows from (2.9) that the
initial point ˜r i(t1) and the ﬁnal point ˜r i(t2) of the varied trajectory are also ﬁxed, i.e.
˜r i(t1) = ri(t1) and ˜r i(t2) = ri(t2) ,

just as required by the calculus of variations.

Having ˜r i(t) one can calculate the localization center velocity ˜vi(t) and the values of
U0(˜r, t) , Ui(˜r, t) on the varied trajectory. Finally, one can calculate the value of L(0, ˜v)
on the same trajectory by setting U0 = 0 and Ui = 0 in (5.1), i.e. from

Putting all the above together we see that the expression

L(0, ˜v) =

L( ˜ψ∗, ˜ψ, ∂ ˜ψ∗, ∂ ˜ψ) d 3x .

L(0, ˜v) − Q

the time integral of (5.11) from t1 to t2 is well deﬁned and equation (5.9) holds with any
varied ﬁeld ˜ψ under the above stated restrictions.

Bodurov

Now, consider a ψ for which the left-side integral in (5.9) is at a minimum (maximum).
According to the calculus of variations this ψ is a solution of the corresponding Euler-
Lagrange equations. Then, as long as equation (5.9) holds, the right-side integral is also
at a minimum (maximum) which is achieved for the “true” trajectory r(t) . This shows
that the right-side integral in (5.9) is the action integral for the trajectory r(t) of the
localization center and that L given by (5.7) is its Lagrangian function. End of proof.

If we set Uµ = gAµ in the Lagrangian function (5.7) we see that the ﬁrst term in it

− gQ(A0 + viAi)

(5.12)

is the part which accounts for the interaction between the space-localized ﬁeld , as a whole,
and the electromagnetic ﬁeld Aµ . This part is identical with the interaction term in the
Lagrangian function for a point charge q = gQ , both in the classical and in the relativistic
cases. For the Lagrangian of a point charge see, for example, Goldstein [9] (Section 1.5)
or Jackson [10] (Section 12.1). The second part in (5.7), clearly, stands for the Lagrangian
function for a “free” localized ﬁeld, as a whole, and it is a function of v only. To ﬁnd it set
Uµ = 0 in the ﬁeld equation (now assumed to be known) and obtain the corresponding
stationary localized solution. Apply to it a Galilei or Lorentz transformation to obtain a
solution whose region of localization is moving with some constant velocity v . Evaluate
the Lagrangian functional (5.1) with this transformed solution and with Uµ = 0 . Since
vi are the transformation parameters, the result will be a function of v , as claimed, and
nothing else. We summarize the ﬁrst principal result which follows from (5.7):

If Assumptions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are met the interaction term in the Lagrangian
function (5.7) for the motion of a space-localized ψ-ﬁeld, as a whole, is identical to the
interaction term in the Lagrangian function for a point charge proportional to Q moving
in an electromagnetic ﬁeld proportional to Uµ , regardless of the type of wave equation
which ψ satisﬁes.

For the second result which follows from (5.7) we observe that the above statement is

valid, in particular, when ψ satisﬁes a Hamiltonian evolution equation of the form

where H is the Hamiltonian density, ηkµ are given by (2.3) and
variational derivative of the Hamiltonian functional H with respect to ψ∗
k . For details
see Bodurov [7]. Indeed, it is easy to see that (5.13) is the Euler-Lagrange equation derived
from the Lagrangian density (which satisﬁes Assumptions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 if H does):

(5.15)

The form (5.13) contains, as special cases, Schr¨odinger and Dirac equations together
with their nonlinear versions. In these equations the constant g has the value g = q/¯h .

13

Complex Space-localized Fields

Bodurov

On the other hand, the interaction term (5.12) and expressions (5.15) tell us that the
electric charge is
q/¯h = g = q/N from which follows that
¯h = N . The dimensionality of N ( ψ is not normalized) is certainly right, i.e., [action]
[H] = [energy]/[volume]
as seen from (5.13) by noticing that the dimensionality of H is

q = gN . Hence, we have

[N ] = [|ψ|2] [volume] = [H] [time] [volume] = [energy] [time] = [action] .

Thus, our second main result is:
If a space-localized ψ-ﬁeld is a solution of a nonlinear complex Hamiltonian evolution
equation with the form (5.13) whose Hamiltonian functional is gauge type I invariant, then
in certain relationships the Hermitian norm hψ, ψi appears in the place in which Planck’s
constant ¯h appears in the corresponding relationships of quantum mechanics.

Two arguments independent from the one above and pertaining to diﬀerent relation-
ships but leading to the same conclusion above, were presented in a paper by the same
author (Bodurov [11], Sections 3 and 4). A year latter, one of these was discussed with
further details in Bodurov [7] (Section 5).

The criterion for the validity of Assumption 2.2, i.e., for the maximum rate of change
of U at which equation (5.7) still holds is derived as follows. Let a be an estimate of the
radius of localization given by the functional

Umax and Umin the values of U , within a sphere with a radius a and a center r , for
which the magnitude
is maximal. L(Umax) and L(Umin) are the
values of the Lagrangian functional (5.1) when it is evaluated with the constant U = Umax
and U = Umin . Then, the sought criterion for △Uµ = (Uµ)max − (Uµ)min

that is, the interaction terms in the Lagrangian (5.7) must be much smaller than the “free”
ψ-ﬁeld Lagrangian L(0, v) — a physically meaningful conclusion.

6. Concluding discussion

It was demonstrated in this paper that if the interaction of a nonlinear space-localized
ψ-ﬁeld with external electromagnetic potentials is deﬁned according to the substitution
(1.1) and Assumptions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are met then the motion of the ψ-ﬁeld, as a whole,
is identical to that of a classical point charge. Moreover, this identity is largely independent
of the particular ψ-ﬁeld equation, as long as the latter is derivable from a gauge I invariant
Lagrangian.

The results (3.10) and (4.14) may be regarded as generalizations of Ehrenfest theorem
showing that this theorem is valid not only for the linear equations of quantum mechanics
but also for the families of NLS and NLD nonlinear ﬁeld equations which possess space-
localized solutions.

One may also say that according to the results (3.13), (4.15) and (5.12) an external
electromagnetic ﬁeld given by a 4-potential, under the Assumptions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3, acts
with the Lorentz “force” g Q
on a space-localized ψ-ﬁeld, whose equivalent
electric charge is q = g Q .

E + v×B
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

As already discussed, the global description of the time evolution of a ψ-ﬁeld by the
trajectory of its center of localization r = r(t) is valid when the variations |△Uµ| within
the localization region are suﬃciently small. It is worth noticing that this correlates very
well with a number of experimental evidences that the concept of elementary particle, as
an individual entity, is meaningful only when the intensities of the external ﬁelds acting
on this particle are within certain bounds.

We would like to look on the results summarized above as new evidence that it is not
only possible but it is also very desirable to represent elementary charges with localized
ψ-ﬁelds. For, these results point to a unique opportunity to reconcile the discrete aspect
with the wave aspect of elementary particles/charges.

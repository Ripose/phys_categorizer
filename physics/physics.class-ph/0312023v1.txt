1 Introduction

Can the radiation pattern of an antenna be isotropic?
A simple argument suggests that this is diﬃcult.
The intensity of radiation depends on the square of the electric (or magnetic) ﬁeld. To
have isotropic radiation, it would seem that the magnitude of the electric ﬁeld would have
to be uniform over any sphere in the far zone. However, the electromagnetic ﬁelds in the
far zone of an antenna are transverse, and it is well known that a vector ﬁeld of constant
magnitude cannot be everywhere tangent to the surface of a sphere (Brouwer’s “hairy-ball
theorem” [1]). Hence, it would appear that the transverse electric ﬁeld in the far zone cannot
have the same magnitude in all directions, and that the radiation pattern cannot be isotropic,
IF the radiation is everywhere linearly polarized [2, 3].

However, electromagnetic waves can have two independent states of polarization, de-
scribed as elliptical polarization in the general case. While a transverse electric ﬁeld with
a single, linearly polarized component cannot be uniform over a sphere in the far zone, it
may be possible that the sum of the squares of the electric ﬁelds with two polarizations is
uniform.

2 The U-Shaped Antenna of Shtrikman

Shmuel Shtrikman has given an example of a U-shaped antenna that generates an isotropic
radiation pattern in the far zone [4] in the limit of zero intensity of the radiation. This
example shows that any desired degree of “isotropicity” can be achieved for a suﬃciently
weak radiation pattern.

Matzner [5] has also shown that the radiation pattern of the U-shaped antenna can in

principle be produced by speciﬁed currents of ﬁnite strength on the surface of a sphere.

2.1 The U-Shaped Antenna

The U-shaped antenna of Matzner et al. [4] is illustrated in Fig. 1. It consists of two vertical
arms of length L = λ/4 (kL = π/2), separated by a short cross piece of length h

λ.

Denoting the peak current in the antenna by I, the current density J can be written

≪

J(r, t) = J(r)e

Thus, the radiation pattern is indeed isotropic in the limit that h

For a ﬁnite separation h between the two vertical arms of the antenna, the deviation from

isotropicity is roughly 1

0.05λ. However, this uniformity is achieved at the expense of a substantial reduction in
the intensity of the radiation. For example, the case of a U-shaped antenna with h = 0.05λ
has an intensity only 1/40 of that of a basic half-wave, center-fed antenna.2

Isotropic Radiation from Currents on a Spherical Shell

In sec. 6.6 of his Ph.D. thesis [5], Matzner shows how the far-zone radiation pattern of the
U-shaped antenna (in the limit h
0) can be reproduced by an appropriate distribution
of currents on a spherical shell of radius R = λ/4. For this, he ﬁrst expands the far-zone
ﬁelds (12)-(13) in vector spherical harmonics, and then matches these to currents on a shell
of radius R and to an appropriate form for the ﬁelds inside the shell.

→

Figures 3 and 4 illustrate this procedure. The key point is that the surface currents
are ﬁnite in magnitude, and hence an isotropic radiator is realizable in the laboratory (in
contrast to the U-shaped antenna, which requires an inﬁnite current I to achieve perfectly
isotropic radiation).

Figure 3: The spherical shell of radius R = λ/4 on which a set of currents can
be found that produces the same far-zone ﬁelds as does the U-shaped antenna.
From [5].

Figure 4: Contours of the current density on the spherical shell that produce
the same far-zone ﬁelds as does the U-shaped antenna. From [5].

In principle, many other surfaces besides that of a sphere could support a pattern of

ﬁnite, oscillating currents whose far zone radiation pattern is isotropic.

3 A Linear Array of “Turnstile” Antennas

Saunders [3] has noted that a certain inﬁnite array (a certain vertical stack) of so-called
“turnstile” antennas [7, 8] can also produce a far-zone radiation pattern that is isotropic

A turnstile antenna consists of a pair of half-wave, center-fed linear dipole antennas

oriented at 90◦ to each other, and driven 90◦ out of phase, as shown in Fig. 5.

Figure 5: A “turnstile” antenna. From [8].

If we approximate the half-wave dipoles by point dipoles, then the dipole moment of the

system can be written

p = p0e−iωt = p0(ˆx + iˆy)e−iωt,
taking the antenna to be aligned along the x and y axes. The electromagnetic ﬁelds in the
far zone are then

In the plane of the antenna, θ = 90◦, the electric ﬁeld has no θ component, and hence no
z component; the turnstile radiation in the horizontal plane is horizontally polarized.
In
the vertical direction, θ = 0◦ or 180◦, the radiation is circularly polarized. For intermediate
angles θ the radiation is elliptically polarized.

The intensity of the radiation varies by a factor of 2 over the sphere, that is, by 3 dB, as
shown in Fig. 6. Compared to other simple antennas, this pattern is remarkably isotropic.

Figure 6: The relative radiation pattern of a single turnstile antenna, and of
a pair of turnstile antennas that are separated by λ/4.

But we can make the pattern even more isotropic by considering a vertical stack of

turnstile antennas.

If the center of the turnstile antenna had been at height z along the z-axis, the only
diﬀerence in the resulting electric and magnetic ﬁelds would be a phase change by kz cos θ
because the path length to the distant observer diﬀers by z cos θ. That is, the ﬁelds (17)-(19)
would simply be multiplied by the phase factor e−ikz cos θ.

Thus, if we have two turnstile antennas, one whose center is at the origin, and the other
whose center is at height z, and we operated them in phase, the ﬁelds (17)-(19) would be
multiplied by

1 + e

−ikz cos θ.

The radiated power would therefore by eq. (21) multiplied by the absolute square of eq. (22):

For example, suppose kz = π/2, i.e., the vertical separation of the two antennas is 1/4 of
a wavelength. Then, the peak of the radiation pattern is only 1.08 times (0.35 db) greater

than the minimum, as shown in Fig. 6. For most practical purposes, this double turnstile
antenna could be considered to be isotropic.

Saunders [3] has further shown that an inﬁnite array of turnstile antennas yields strictly
isotropic radiation provided the number N(z) of such antennas in an interval dz along the
vertical axis is proportional to K0(kz), the so-called modiﬁed Bessel function of order zero
[9], whose behavior is sketched in Fig. 7. The antennas are all driven in phase. Since the
function K0(kz) is sharply peaked at z = 0, we see that a properly spaced collection of
1 wavelength in z could produce an extremely
turnstile antennas that extends over only
isotropic radiation pattern.

Figure 7: The modiﬁed Bessel function K0(x). From [9].

The U-shaped antenna of sec. 2 is a variant on the theme of a vertical stack of turnstile
antennas. Since the currents are opposite in the two vertical arms of the U-shaped antenna,
the charge accumulations on these arms have opposite signs as well. Thus, the two vertical
arms are in eﬀect a vertical stack of horizontal dipole antennas. If we had a second U-shaped
antenna, rotated by 90◦ about the vertical compared to the ﬁrst, and driven 90◦ out of phase,
this would be equivalent to a vertical stack of (horizontal) turnstile antennas. Such a double
U-shaped antenna is discussed in sec. 6.5.2 of [5], where its radiation pattern is found to be
isotropic, although the details of the polarization of the radiation ﬁelds diﬀer slightly from
those for a single U-shaped radiator.

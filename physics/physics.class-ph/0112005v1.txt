Abstract

By invariance arguments we obtain the relativistic and non-relativistic invariant dy-
namical equations of the spinning electron. The dynamics can be expressed in terms of
the evolution of the point charge which satisﬁes a fourth order diﬀerential equation or,
alternatively, by describing the evolution of both the center of mass and center of charge
of the particle.

1 Introduction

The latest LEP experiments at CERN suggest that the electron charge is conﬁned within a
region of radius Re < 10−19m. Nevertheless, the quantum mechanical behaviour of the electron
appears at distances of the order of its Compton’s wave length λC = ¯h/mc ≃ 10−13m, which is
six orders of magnitude larger.

One possibility to reconcile these features is the assumption from the classical viewpoint that
the charge of the electron is a point but at the same time this point is never at rest and it is
aﬀected by the so called zitterbewegung and therefore it is moving in a conﬁned region of size λC.
This is the basic structure of the spinning particle models obtained in the kinematical formalism
developed by the author [1] and also suggested by Dirac’s analysis of the internal motion of the
electron [2]. There, the charge of the particle is at a point r, but this point is not the center
In general the charge moves around the center of mass in a kind of
of mass of the particle.
harmonic or central motion. It is this motion of the charge that gives rise to the spin and dipole
structure of the particle. In particular, the classical model that when quantised satisﬁes Dirac’s
equation shows, for the center of mass observer, a charge moving at the speed of light in circles
of radius Ro = ¯h/2mc and contained in a plane orthogonal to the spin direction [3]. It is this
classical model of electron we shall consider in the subsequent analysis.

Therefore, to describe the dynamics of a charged spinning particle we have to follow the charge
trajectory or, alternatively as we shall see later, the center of mass motion and the motion of the
charge around the center of mass. In general the center of mass satisﬁes Newton-like dynamical
equations in terms of the external force which is not deﬁned at the center of mass position but
rather at the position of the charge. The analysis of the radiation reaction is not considered here
and is left to a future paper.

2 The invariant dynamical equation

Let us try to obtain the diﬀerential equation satisﬁed by the motion of a particular point of an
arbitrary mechanical system. The method is to obtain ﬁrst the whole family of trajectories of
that point corresponding to all possible inertial observers. This family will be parameterised by
some set of parameters and the elimination of these parameters among the function and their
derivatives will do the job.

Then, let us consider the trajectory r(t), t ∈ [t1, t2] followed by a point of a system for
an arbitrary inertial observer. Any other inertial observer is related to the previous one by a
transformation of a kinematical group such that their relative space-time measurements of any
space-time event are given by

t′ = T (t, r; g1, . . . , gr),

r′ = R(t, r; g1, . . . , gr),

where the functions T and R deﬁne the action of the kinematical group G, of parameters
(g1, . . . , gr), on space-time. Then the description of the trajectory of that point for observer O′
is obtained from

t′(t) = T (t, r(t); g1, . . . , gr),

r′(t) = R(t, r(t); g1, . . . , gr),

∀t ∈ [t1, t2].

If we eliminate t as a function of t′ from the ﬁrst equation and substitute into the second we
shall get

r′(t′) = r′(t′; g1, . . . , gr).

(1)

Since observer O′ is arbitrary, equation (1) represents the complete set of trajectories of the point
for all inertial observers. Elimination of the r group parameters among the function r′(t′) and
their derivatives will give us the diﬀerential equation satisﬁed by the trajectory of the point. If
G is either the Galilei or Poincar´e group it is a ten-parameter group so that we have to work out
in general up to the fourth derivative to obtain suﬃcient equations to eliminate the parameters.
Therefore the order of the diﬀerential equation is dictated by the number of parameters and the
structure of the kinematical group.

Let us analyse a simple example. We shall consider the free point particle.

In the non-
relativistic case the relationship of the inertial observer O with other inertial observer O′ is
given by the action of the Galilei group:
t′ = t + b,

r′ = R(α)r + vt + a,

(2)

where b and a represent the parameters of a time and space translation, respectively, v is the
velocity of observer O as measured by O′ and R(α) represents a rotation matrix that describes
their relative orientation, expressed in terms of three parameters α of a suitable parametrization
of the rotation group.

For the free point particle it is possible to ﬁnd a particular observer, the center of mass

observer O∗, such that the trajectory of the particle for this observer reduces to
r∗(t∗) ≡ 0,

∀t∗ ∈ [t∗

1, t∗
2].

and therefore its trajectory for any other observer O can be obtained from
t(t∗) = t∗ + b,

r(t∗) = vt∗ + a.

In the relativistic case we have that the Poincar´e group action is given by

t′ = γ

v · R(α)r

r′ = R(α)r + γvt +

(1 + γ)c2 (v · R(α)r) v + a,

whith γ = (1 − v2/c2)−1/2 and where the parameters have the same meaning and domains as in
the non-relativistic case but here v < c. The trajectory of the point particle for observer O will
be obtained from

(6)
Elimination of t∗ in terms of t from the ﬁrst equation of both (3) and (6) and substitution into
the second yields the trajectory of the point for an arbitrary observer, which in the relativistic
and non-relativistic formalism reduces to

t(t∗) = γt∗ + b,

r(t∗) = γvt∗ + a.

r(t) = (t − b)v + a.

Elimination of group parameters v, b and a implies that the free evolution of a point particle
satisﬁes the second order diﬀerential equation
d2r
dt2 = 0.
We must remark that equation (7) is independent of any group parameter and therefore its form
is the same when written in any inertial reference frame. We thus obtain by this method an
invariant dynamical equation.

(7)

But, what happens if the point we are analysing can never be ﬁnd at rest during some ﬁnite
time interval and for some particular inertial observer? This is the case of the position of the
charge of the spinning particle models based upon the mentioned kinematical formalism [1].

3 The non-relativistic spinning electron

Let us assume as a model of electron the one in which for the center of mass observer the charge
is moving in circles of radius Ro at the speed c in a plane orthogonal to the spin. We take this
plane as the XOY plane in cartesian coordinates. We can use as natural space and time units Ro
and Ro/c respectively, so that all space and time magnitudes are dimensionless and simmilarly
the velocity, acceleration and further time derivatives. In these units the time observable for the
center of mass observer is just the phase of this internal motion and the velocity of light takes
the value c = 1.

For the center of mass observer, the trajectory of the charge of the electron is expressed in

3-vector form as

For the center of mass observer we get that

For any arbitrary inertial observer we get

t(t∗; g) = t∗ + b,
r(t∗; g) = R(α)r∗(t∗) + t∗v + a,

where g ≡ (b, a, v, α) represents any arbitrary element of the Galilei group.

Because in this work we will be involved with time derivatives of order higher than two,
instead of using as usual an over dot to represent them we shall deﬁne the order of derivation
by an exponent enclosed in brackets as

In this non-relativistic case dt∗/dt = 1, then, after using (8) in some expressions we get the

Therefore, the diﬀerential equation satisﬁed by the position of the charge of a non-relativistic
electron and for any arbitrary inertial observer is

The general solution of (9) is

(8)

(9)

which involves 12 arbitrary integration constants A, B, C and D. To select from this general
solution the trajectories with circular motion some supplementary conditions must be imposed.
The absolute value of the acceleration is Galilei invariant. Even more, |r(2)| is constant for
circular motions and this leads to r(2) · r(3) = 0, and making in (9) the scalar product with r(3)
we also get r(3) · r(4) = 0. These two conditions reduce to 10 the number of essential parameters
of the general solution which imply C = D and C · D = 0.

3.1 The center of mass

The center of mass position of the electron is deﬁned as

q = r + r(2),

(10)

(11)

because it reduces to q = 0 and q(1) = 0 for the center of mass observer, so that dynamical
equations can be rewritten in terms of the position of the charge and the center of mass as

q(2) = 0,

r(2) = q − r.

Our fourth-order dynamical equation (9) can be split into two second order dynamical equations:
A free equation for the center of mass and a central harmonic motion of the charge position r
around the center of mass q of angular frequency 1 in these natural units.

In this non-relativistic case, since the transformation of the acceleration between inertial

observers is given by

′(2) = R(α)r(2).
It turns out that the deﬁnition of the center of mass position (10) implies by (2) that it transforms
between inertial observers as

r

q′ = r′ + r

′(2) = R(α)q + vt + a,

The center of mass position for observer O′, q′, is just the Galilei transformed of q. This is not
true in general in the relativistic case.

3.2

Interaction with some external ﬁeld

The free dynamical equation q(2) = 0 is equivalent to dP /dt = 0, where P = mq(1) is the
linear momentum of the system. Then our free equations should be replaced in the case of an
interaction with an external electromagnetic ﬁeld by

mq(2) = e[E + r(1) × B],

r(2) = q − r,

where in the Lorentz force the ﬁelds are deﬁned at point r and it is the velocity of the charge
that gives rise to the magnetic force term, while the second equation is left unchanged since it
corresponds to the center of mass deﬁnition.

3.3 The spin dynamical equation

The relative position of the charge with respect to the center of mass is k = r − q. The kinemat-
ical theory of spinning particles shows that the spin of this system reduces to the (anti)orbital
angular momentum with respect to the center of mass of this relative position vector, i.e,

S = −mk × k(1).

5

(12)

The time derivative of this expression leads to

dS
dt

= −mk × k(2) = k × m q(2),

since k×r(2) = 0. The spin variation is equal to the torque, with respect to the center of mass, of
the external Lorentz force applied at the point charge r. If expressed in terms of the derivatives
of the charge position, the spin takes the form

S = m r(3) × r(2).

(13)

The spin is a constant of the motion for the free particle and thus the plane spanned by the
relative vectors k and k(1) (or r(2) and r(3)) conserves its orientation. Because this plane contains
the relative motion between both points we call this plane the zitterbewegung plane.

3.4 A work theorem

If we make the scalar product of q(1) by the dynamical equation of q(2), we have

and thus

The variation of the kinetic energy of the electron is the work done by the external Lorentz force,
evaluated at the charge position, and along the center of mass trajectory.

4 The relativistic spinning electron

Let us assume the same electron model in the relativistic case. Since the charge is moving at the
speed of light for the center of mass observer it is moving at this speed for every other inertial
observer. Now, the relationship of space-time measurements between the center of mass observer
and any arbitrary inertial observer is given by:

From equations (20)-(22) we can express the magnitudes A, B and γ in terms of these scalar
products between the diﬀerent time derivatives (r(i) · r(j)). The constraint that the velocity is
1 implies that all these and further scalar products for higher derivatives can be expressed in
terms of only three of them. If the three equations (15)-(17) are solved in terms of the unknowns
v, V and K and substituded in (18), we obtain the diﬀerential equation satisﬁed by the charge

(25)

It is a fourth order ordinary diﬀerential equation which contains as solutions only motions at the
speed of light. In fact, if (r(1) · r(1)) = 1, then by derivation we have (r(1) · r(2)) = 0 and the next
derivative leads to (r(2) · r(2)) + (r(1) · r(3)) = 0. If we take this into account and make the scalar
product of (25) with r(1), we get (r(1) · r(4)) + 3(r(2) · r(3)) = 0, which is another relationship
between the derivatives as a consequence of |r(1)| = 1.

For the center of mass observer r∗(i+2) = −r∗(i), |r∗(i)| = 1, and thus r∗(i) · r∗(i+1) = 0, for all i.

4.1 The center of mass
For the observer O∗ the center of mass of the electron is at rest and located at the origin of its
reference frame. What is the center of mass position for an arbitary inertial observer?

The velocity parameter v is the velocity of the observer O∗ as measured by O. Although we
do not know where the center of mass is, we take this value (26) as the velocity of the center of
mass of the electron for the inertial observer O. Then

q(1) =

in fact the time derivative of this expression and also a constant of the motion because its time
derivative yields

we see that the coeﬃcient of the acceleration r(2) in (35) is (q − r)2/(1 − q(1) · r(1)), and it turns
out that the fourth order dynamical equation for the position of the charge (25) can be rewritten
as a system of two second order diﬀerential equations for the positions q and r

q(2) = 0,

r(2) =

1 − q(1) · r(1)
(q − r)2

(q − r) .

Simmilarly as for the non-relativistic electron we get a free motion for the center of mass and
a central motion around q for the position of the charge. The second equation for r(2) is just a
new form of writing the center of mass deﬁnition (35). These equations are relativistic invariant
because are written in the same form in every inertial frame. If r′ is the position of the charge for
the observer O′, it can be expressed in terms of r by the transformation equations (4). However
the center of mass position q′ is not the corresponding transformed of q, but it is expressed
in O′ frame in terms of r′ and its derivatives by (35). The center of mass position does not
transform like the spatial component of a four-vector. Nevertheless, the four-velocity associated
to the motion of the center of mass vµ ≡ (γ(q(1)), γ(q(1))q(1)) transforms like a true four-vector.

4.2

Interaction with some external ﬁeld

The free equation for the center of mass motion q(2) = 0, represents the conservation of the
linear momentum dP /dt = 0. But the linear momentum is written in terms of the center of
mass velocity as P = mγ(q(1))q(1), so that the free dynamical equations (38) in the presence of
an external ﬁeld should be replaced by

P (1) = F ,

r(2) =

1 − q(1) · r(1)
(q − r)2

(q − r) ,

(39)

where F is the external force and the second equation is left unchanged because we consider,
even with interaction, the same deﬁnition of the center of mass position. If the external force is
produced by some external electromagnetic ﬁeld, then

F = e

E + r(1) × B
h

i

,

where the ﬁelds E(t, r) and B(t, r) are deﬁned at the position of the charge and where it is the
velocity of the charge that produces the magnetic force term. If we express the derivative of the
linear momentum in terms of the center of mass velocity and acceleration

dP
dt

= mγ(q(1))q(2) + mγ(q(1))3(q(1) · q(2))q(1)

we get

mγ(q(1))3(q(1) · q(2)) = F · q(1)
and by leaving the highest derivative q(2) on the left hand side we ﬁnally get the diﬀerential
equations which describe the evolution of a relativistic spinning electron in the presence of an
external electromagnetic ﬁeld:

4.3 The spin dynamical equation

If we call again k = r − q to the relative position of the charge with respect to the center of
mass, the spin of the system is the (anti)orbital angular momentum of the charge motion around
the center of mass,

S = −mk × k(1).

(42)

This is consistent with the usual torque equation because the time variation of the spin is

= −mk × k(2) = k × m q(2),

because k × r(2) = 0 and which represents the torque, with respect to the center of mass, of the
right hand side of equation (40) considered as a force applied at the point charge r. The explicit
form of the spin in terms of the derivatives of the charge position is,

S =

4m(r(2) · r(2))2

(r(2) · r(2))3/2 + (r(3) · r(3)) −
"

3(r(2) · r(3))2
4(r(2) · r(2)) #

2 r(3) × r(2).

(43)

As in the non-relativistic case we call the plane spanned by r(2) and r(3), the zitterbewegung
plane.

4.4 Other constants of the motion

We have found that the spin (42) is a constant of the motion for a free particle. We can obtain
in the free evolution other constants of the motion. If we deﬁne the vector magnitude

n =

r(2) × r(3)
(r(2) · r(2))3/2 ,

(44)

in the spin direction and which is orthogonal to the zitterbewegung plane, then n(1) = 0. In
fact, the derivative of (44) leads to

1
(r(2) · r(2))3/2 "

r(2) × r(4) −

3(r(2) · r(3))
(r(2) · r(2))

r(2) × r(3)

,

#

where the term between square brackets is just the vector or cross product of the left hand side
of (25) by r(2) from the left. Since n is a conserved vector its direction is also a conserved
magnitude and therefore the plane spanned by r(2) and r(3) conserves its orientation in space
n = n/|n| is also another constant of
during the free motion. This implies that the unit vector
the motion as can be checked.

4.5 A work theorem

If we make the scalar product of both sides of equation (40) by q(1) we get

mq(1) · q(2) =

E + r(1) × B

· q(1),

i.e.,

so that the variation of the energy of the electron is the work done by the external Lorentz force
along the center of mass trajectory.

We must remark again that the ﬁelds are deﬁned at the position of the charge. In smooth
ﬁelds of very small local variation and for a low center of mass velocity the average value of r(1)
during a complete turn of the electron charge is basically q(1) and it turns out that the magnetic
ﬁeld produces no work on the electron. But nevertheless this formalism suggests many other
situations in which local variations of the ﬁelds or equivalently non negligible ﬁeld gradients at
distances of order of λC may produce local changes of the energy of the particle. This might be
the case of the intersticial magnetic ﬁeld of ferromagnetic materials, for instance, as well as in
diverse condensed matter physics phenomena. One of these features was considered as giving
rise to a plausible explanation of the magnetoresistence of polycrystaline ﬁlms by spin polarised
tunneling [4].

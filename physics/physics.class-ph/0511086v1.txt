The Lagrangian, the Hamiltonian and the constant of motion of the gravita-
tional attraction of two bodies when one of them has variable mass is con-
sidered. The relative and center of mass coordinates are not separated, and
choosing the reference system in the body with much higher mass, it is possible
to reduce the system of equations to 1-D problem. Then, a constant of motion,
the Lagrangian, and the Hamiltonian are obtained. The trajectories found in
the space position-velocity,(x, v), are qualitatively diﬀerent from those on the
space position-momentum,(x, p).

ABSTRACT

1. Introduction

Mass variable systems has been important since the foundation of the classical
mechanics and have been relevant in modern physics [1]. Among these type
of systems one could mentioned: the motion of rockets [2], the kinetic theory
of dusty plasmas [3], propagation of electromagnetic waves in dispersive and
nonlinear media [4], neutrinos mass oscillations [5], black holes formation [6],
and comets interacting with solar wind [7]. The interest in this last system
comes from the concern about to determinate correctly the trajectory of the
comet as its mass is changing. This system belong to the so called two-bodies
problem. The gravitational two-bodies system is one of the must well known
systems in classical mechanics [8] and is the system which made a revolution
in our planetary and cosmological concepts. Normally, one assumes that the
masses of these two bodies are ﬁxed and unchanged during the dynamical
interaction [9]. However, this can not be true any more when one consider
comets as one of the bodies. Comets loose part of their mass as traveling
around the sun (or other star) due to their interaction with the solar wind
which blows oﬀ particles from their surfaces. In fact, it is possible that the
comet could disappear as it approaches to the sun [10]. So, one should consider
the problem of having one body with variable mass during its gravitational
interaction with other body.

In this paper, one considers the problem of ﬁnding the constant of motion,
Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian, for the gravitational interaction of two bodies
when one of them is loosing its mass during the gravitational interaction. The
mass of one of the bodies is assumed much larger than the mass of the other
body. Choosing the reference system on big-mass body, the three-dimensional
two-bodies problem is reduced to a one-dimensional problem. Then, one uses
the constant of motion approach [11] to ﬁnd the Lagrangian and the Hamil-
tonian of the system. A model for the mass variation is given for an explicit
illustration of form of these quantities. With this model, one shows that the
trajectories in the space position-velocity (deﬁned by the constant of motion)
are diﬀerent than the trajectories on the space position-momentum (deﬁned
by the Hamiltonian).

from arbitrary inertial reference system, are given by

is constant and that m2 varies with respect the time. Taking into consideration
this mass variation, Eqs. (1a) and (1b) are written as

where it has been deﬁned ˙m2 as ˙m2 = dm2/dt. Now, let us consider the usual
relative, r, and center of mass, R, coordinates deﬁned as

−

r = r2

r1 ,

and

R =

−

m1r1 + m2r2
m1 + m2

.

Let us then diﬀerentiate twice these coordinates with respect the time, taking
into consideration the equations (2) and (3). Thus, the following equations
are obtained

One sees that the relative motion does not decouple from the center of mass
motion. So, these new coordinates are not really useful to deal with mass
variation systems. In fact, using (4) , one has

r2 = R +

and ˙r2 = ˙R +

Substituting these expressions in (5) and (6), one can see more clearly this

However, one can consider the case for m1 ≫
m2 (which is the case star-comet),
and consider to put our reference system just on the ﬁrst body (r1 = ~0). In
this case, Eq. (3) becomes

(15b)

and

m2(2 ˙r ˙ϕ sin θ + r ¨ϕ sin θ + 2 ˙ϕ ˙θ cos θ) = ˙m2r ˙ϕ sin θ .
Thus, one has obtained coupling among these coordinates due to the term ˙m2.
Nevertheless, one can restrict oneself to consider the case ˙m2r
0. For this
case, it follows that ˙ϕ = 0, and the resulting equations are

and

m2(2 ˙r ˙θ + r ¨θ) = 0 .
Let mo be the mass of the second body when this one is very far away from
the ﬁrst body (when a comet is very far away from the sun, the mass of the
comet remains constant). Since m2 6
= 0 on (16b), the expression inside the
parenthesis must be zero.
In addition, one can multiply this expression by
mor to get the following constant of motion
Pθ = mor2 ˙θ .

Using this constant of motion in (16a), one obtains the equation

This equation represents a dissipative system for ˙m2 > 0 and anti-dissipative
system for ˙m2 < 0. Suppose now that m2 is a function of the distance between
the ﬁrst and second body, m2 = m2(r). Therefore, it follows that

where F is an arbitrary function of the characteristic curve. One can have a
constant of motion with units of energy by selecting F as F = C/2mo. That
is, the constant of motion is given by

2. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian

Given the time independent constant of motion (25), the Lagrangian of the
system (20) can be obtained using the following known expression [11]

L(r, v) = v

K(r, v) dv

Thus, the Lagrangian is given by

L(r, v) =

The generalized linear momentum (p = ∂L/∂v) is

p =

and the Hamiltonian is

H(r, p) =

Note from (25) and (29) that the constant of motion and Hamiltonian can be

see that this extreme value is a minimum for m2(r∗)

3. Model of Variable Mass

As a possible application of (25) and (29), consider that a comet looses material
as a result of the interaction with star wind in the following way (for one cycle
of oscillation)

m2(r) = 

where i = in for the incoming case, and i = out for the outgoing case. As
an example of illustration of this model, let us use the following parameters
to estimate the dependence of several physical quantities with respect the
parameter α,

Fig. 1 shows the curves of Vef f (r) for several values of α (incoming case). As
one can see from this ﬁgure, the location of the minimum does not change,
but the minimum value of Vef f tends to disappear as α goes to zero. Also for
the incoming case, Fig. 2 shows how the minimum distance of approximation
of the two bodies, r1, and maximum distance, r2, behave as a function of the

parameter α. As one can guess, the following limit is satisﬁed limα→0 r1 =
limα→0 r2 = r∗ which will become a inﬂexion point for Vef f . Fig. 3 shows
the velocity (v) and normalized linear momentum (p/mo) as a function of r
for several values of α and for the incoming case. All the trajectories start at
r2 = 200 and ﬁnish at r1(α). One can see the diﬀerence of the trajectories in
(a) with respect to (b) due to position dependence of the momentum, relation
(40).

Conclusions

The Lagrangian, Hamiltonian and a constant of motion of the gravitational
attraction of two bodies when one of them has variable mass were given. One
found that the relative and center of mass coordinates are coupled due to
this mass variation. However, chosen the reference system in the much more
massive body, it was possible to reduce the system to 1-D problem. Then, the
constant of motion, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian were obtained. One main
feature of these quantities was the appearance of an eﬀective potential, which
is reduced (when ˙m2 = 0) to the usual gravitational eﬀective potential of two
bodies with ﬁxed masses. Other feature was the distance dependence of the
generalized linear momentum. A model for comet-mass-variation was given
which depends on the parameter α. A study was made of the dependence with
respect to α of Vef f , minimum and maximum distance between the two bodies,
and the trajectories in the spaces (r, v) and (r, p). Of course, the problem of
the interaction comet-star with the variation of mass deserves more complete
analysis. The intention here with this example was to show explicitly the form
of the constant of motion, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian and to point out the
diﬀerent trajectories behavior in the spaces (r, v) and (r, p) arising from the
constant of motion and Hamiltonian.

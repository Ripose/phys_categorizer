Falling chains

(Dated: July 30, 2005)

The one-dimensional falling motion of a bungee chain suspended from a rigid support and of a
chain falling from a resting heap on a table is studied. Their Lagrangians are found to contain
no explicit time dependence. As a result, these falling chains are conservative systems. Each of
their Lagrange’s equations of motion is shown to contain a term that enforces energy conservation
when masses are transferred between subchains. We show in particular that Cayley’s 1857 energy
nonconserving solution for a chain falling from a resting heap is incorrect because it neglects the
energy gained when the transferred link is emitted by the emitting subchain. The maximum chain
tension measured by Calkin and March for the falling bungee chain is given a simple if rough
interpretation. In the simpliﬁed one-dimensional treatment, the kinetic energy of the center of mass
of the falling bungee chain is found to be converted by the chain tension at the rigid support into the
internal kinetic energy of the chain. However, as the chain reaches full extension, even this internal
kinetic energy disappears in a momentum conserving but inelastic collision at the moment the chain
tip reaches full extension. This is followed by a grand ﬁnale as the chain snaps and rebounds against
its support.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A ﬂexible heavy chain is suspended from a rigid sup-
port by its two ends placed close together. One end is
then released in the manner of a bungee fall, while the
stationary arm gets longer. Calkin and March1, in an ex-
cellent paper, have shown that the falling arm falls faster
than free fall. The system is nevertheless conservative,
“there being no dissipative mechanisms”. They go on to
measure the falling motion experimentally, and demon-
strate explicitly that their theory agrees with experiment.
They ﬁnd, in particular, that the chain tension T at the
rigid support reaches a maximum value of about 25M g,
where M is the total mass of the chain. This is far in ex-
cess of the maximum value of only 2M g when the falling
end is falling with the acceleration g due to gravity. We
shall explain in Sect.IV that it is the ﬁnite size of the
link that prevents T from going to the inﬁnite value pre-
dicted by a simple one-dimensional continuum model of
the falling bungee chain.

The chain tension T diverges in the continuum limit
because it contains a term proportional to v2, the squared
velocity of the falling arm. As the chain falls, energy
conservation concentrates the entire mechanical energy
in the still falling arm. As the mass of the falling arm
vanishes at the end of the fall, its falling velocity diverges
to inﬁnity.1 The phenomenon of energy concentration in
the falling arm is similar to that occurring in the crack of
the whip. In the words of Bragg2,3, a shock “wave runs
down the cord and carries energy to the lash at the end,”
where the velocity diverges to inﬁnity in the continuum
limit4,5.

Even so, in many older textbooks on mechanics,6,7,8
the falling arm is incorrectly described as falling freely,
and is brought to rest later by inelastic impacts at the
bend of the chain. The kinetic energy loss in a completely
inelastic collision is of course real. It was ﬁrst described in
a work published in 1783 by Lazare Carnot,9,10,11 father

of Sadi Carnot of thermodynamics. The eﬀect is called
Carnot’s energy loss or Carnot’s theorem in Sommerfeld’s
book on mechanics.9 This eﬀect of an impulse on a dy-
namical system had already been treated by an addi-
tional term by Lagrange in his equation of motion.12,13
In contrast, Hamel14 has obtained the correct solution by
assuming energy conservation. We shall show in this pa-
per that energy conservation results because the Carnot
energy loss caused by a transferred mass absorbed by the
receiving subchain is exactly counterbalanced by the en-
ergy gained when the mass is emitted by the emitting
subchain.

The large maximal chain tension measured by Calkin
and March1 should leave no doubt that the bungee
chain indeed falls faster than g. This result has sub-
sequently been conﬁrmed experimentally by Schagerl et
al.15 Photographic evidence can also be found in a re-
port by Taft16. The correct solution of the motion
of the falling bungee chain by energy conservation has
also been included in some recent textbooks on classical
dynamics.17,18,19.

We should add that Schagerl et al.15 were unaware of
the measurement of Calkin and March1. Their own mea-
surement came also as a surprise as some of the authors
had previously concluded by theoretical analysis that the
chain was only falling as fast as g, and that the total me-
chanical energy was not conserved.20,21 In these earlier
papers, the authors rejected Hamel’s energy conserving
solution,14 and insisted that there was real dissipation
caused by the inelastic but momentum-conserving im-
pacts at the bend of the chain. They justiﬁed their treat-
ment by quoting Sommerfeld’s use of Carnot’s energy loss
in another falling chain problem9 to be described below.
The experimental ﬁnding of Schagerl et al. that the
free end of the falling bungee chain is “without any
doubt”15 falling faster than g seems to have caused the
authors much distress and to have led them to conclude
that the motion of this falling chain is non-unique, be-

cause “it is important to note that for the folded string
itself there exist more solutions which fulﬁll the balance
of linear momentum (but do not conserve the mechani-
cal energy).”15 This “non-uniqueness” is presumably the
paradox referred to in the title of their paper “On the
paradox of the free falling folded chain.”

This conclusion that non-unique solutions exist is
clearly untenable because whether the chain is energy-
its equation of motion is a linear
conserving or not,
diﬀerential equation with a unique solution for any
given set of initial conditions. Hence the experimental
observation1,15,16 of faster than g fall proves that the mo-
tion cannot be the freely falling, energy nonconserving
one. There is thus no paradox in the problem.

A review article published in 2004 by Irschik and
Holl22, quoting additional references, propagates the
same erroneous viewpoint that for the falling bungee
chain, momentum is conserved but mechanical energy is
not conserved. These authors know of the experimental
work of Schagerl et al. but not that of Calkin and March.
In fact, in a previous paper on Lagrange’s equations,
Irschik and Holl23 express puzzlement at the Schagerl
result because they believe that the string tension at
the base of the falling arm [called N in their Eq.(6.22)]
should vanish, and therefore that arm should be falling
freely. They realize that this conclusion disagrees with
the Schagerl observation.

We shall show in Sect.III that the erroneous conclusion
of energy loss comes from the neglect of the energy gained
when the transferred mass at the fold of the chain is
emitted by the falling arm. This is the exact time reverse
of the Carnot energy loss incurred when the transferred
mass sticks onto the stationary arm of the bungee chain.
Now there is another falling chain problem where the
consensus in the literature even today seems to be for
the nonconservation of the total mechanical energy. The
steady fall of a stationary heap of chain resting on a
table link by link through a hole in the table appears
to have been ﬁrst studied by the eminent mathemati-
cian Arthur Cayley in 185722,24. He treated the mo-
tion as a continuous-impact problem leading to a non-
conservative system and a falling acceleration of g/3.
Cayley’s falling chain problem appears as Problem I.7
of Sommerfeld9, where the connection to Carnot’s en-
ergy loss is explicitly stated.
It can also be found in
Refs.18,25,26,27,28,29,30. Note that Problem 9-15 in Ref.29
has been rewritten in Ref.30 without any explicit mention
of energy loss. However, the solutions given in the two
Instructor’s Manuals31,32 (available from the publishers
only to instructors) are identical.

The only dissent we have found against this common
consensus comes from the recent paper by de Sousa and
Rodrigues33. They start from the standard Newton equa-
tion for the two variable mass subchains (about which
more later), and promptly obtain the wrong solution,
i.e., the energy-nonconserving solution with acceleration
a = g, for the falling bungee chain. They then solve
the problem of the chain falling from a resting heap in

2

a diﬀerent way by immediately assuming energy conser-
vation. This assumption yields the right solution, as we
shall show below. So their method is also not foolproof.
In Sect.III, we shall show speciﬁcally that the mass
transfer of a link from the heap to the falling subchain
is the same energy conserving process operating in the
falling bungee chain, namely an exoergic mass emission
followed by a counterbalancing endoergic mass absorp-
tion. Thus Cayley and his followers see only half of a
two-step mechanical process that is energy-conserving as
a whole.

Given the brief physics history of these falling chains
sketched above,
it is of interest to determine clearly
and unambiguously when a mechanical system such
as a falling chain is energy conserving. The answer
had already been given in 1788 by Joseph Lagrange in
M´ecanique analytique:12 In modern terminology using
the Lagrangian
(x, p), two
conditions must be satisﬁed for the mechanical energy E
and ∂
to be conserved: E =

(x, v) and the Hamiltonian

as we shall describe in more details in Sect.II. We shall
also write the condition E =
in the original form given
to it by Lagrange,12 who referred to kinetic energies by
their 18th century name of “live forces” (forces vives).
These conditions are perhaps well-known, as they can be
found in most textbooks on analytic dynamics, but they
seem to have been too infrequently applied when actual
physics problems are solved.

To show explicitly how this energy conservation works
in the mass transfer between subchains, we begin in
Sect.III with the standard force equation of motion for
a variable mass system9,33,34,35,36 that can be written in
the same form for both the emitting and the absorbing
subchains. For the special case where no external forces
act on these arms, we show explicitly that the mass trans-
fer is made up of an exoergic mass emission followed by
an endoergic mass absorption when the transferred mass
sticks inelastically to the receiving arm. We ﬁnd fur-
thermore that the complete process of mass transfer con-
serves mechanical energy when the transferred mass has
the velocity given to it by Lagrange’s equation of motion.
Hence Lagrange’s formulation gives eﬀortlessly not only
the simplest, but also the most complete, description of
the motion of both falling chains.

There is an important practical diﬀerence between the
two falling chains, however. The link-by-link mass trans-
fer of the falling bungee chain is automatically guaran-
teed at the bend of the chain, but it is hard to realize for
the chain falling from a resting heap. The bungee chain
always falls in more or less the same way, but the motion
of the resting heap depends on how the heap is built.
More than one link at a time might be set into motion
as the chain falls, and some of them might even jump
above the table before falling into the hole. These com-
plications make it hard to check the idealized theoretical

result by an actual measurement.

We therefore concentrate on the falling bungee chain in
the rest of the paper. In Sect.IV, we give a simple-minded
interpretation of the maximal chain tension measured by
Calkin and March1. Then we explain in Sect.V how to
understand the total loss of kinetic energy at the mo-
ment the chain reaches full extension, and why the chain
rebounds against its support afterwards. In a short con-
cluding Sect.VI, we pay tribute to Lagrange’s formulation
of classical mechanics.

These two terms cancel each other because the total time
derivatives satisfy the canonical equations of motion of

II. THE LAGRANGIAN AND THE
HAMILTONIAN

Figure 1 shows schematically the bungee chain position
when its falling end has fallen through a distance of x.
The chain is ﬂexible, and has mass M , length L and a
uniform linear mass density µ = M/L. Its Lagrangian in
the idealized one-dimensional treatment is

uniquely an upward pointing chain tension
acts on the bottom of the right arm at the point BR
shown in Fig. 1. This tension comes from the x depen-
dence of the kinetic energy, and serves the important
function of enforcing energy conservation. The mistake
made in the erroneous energy-nonconserving solution is
to leave out this important term. We shall explain in the
next section why this tension points up and not down, as
one might naively expect.

It is interesting to apply our analysis next to the chain
falling from a resting heap on a table through a hole in
it because the situation here is even more transparent.
Again let x be the falling distance, now measured from
the table. The falling chain then has the attributes

The resulting solution33

grange’s equation of motion

In the incorrect treatment, the downward tension µv2/2
that comes from the x dependence of the kinetic energy
of the falling chain is missing.

It is interesting to point out that with or without the
chain tension term, the diﬀerential equation describes a
system undergoing a constant acceleration ˙v = a. Hence
v2 = 2ax. The diﬀerential equation can then be reduced
term by term to the algebraic equation

g + sa = a + 2a,

giving a =

Here a switching function s = 1 or 0 has been added to
the second term on the left in order to switch it on or oﬀ.
Hence the solution is a = g/2 for s = 1 with the chain
tension, and a = g/3 for s = 0 without the chain tension.
We thus see that the Lagrangian approach gives an
essentially foolproof way of generating the correct equa-
tion of motion in a situation that is known to be rather
confusing.

III. MASS TRANSFER BETWEEN SUBCHAINS

It is interesting to clarify how the falling chain transfers
mass from one subchain to the other. Let us suppose that
subchain 2 of mass m2+∆m and velocity v2 emits a small
mass ∆m at velocity u to subchain 1 of mass m1
∆m
and velocity v1. The transferred mass is related to the
subchain masses as

−

∆m = ∆m1 =

∆m2.

−

Now at the receiving subchain 1, the initial and ﬁnal

momenta are

p1i = (m1
p1f = m1(v1 + ∆v1),

−

∆m)v1 + u∆m,

where we have included the momentum of the transferred
mass ∆m in the initial state, for the sake of notational
simplicity. The total momentum change

∆p1 = p1f −

p1i
= m1∆v1 + ∆m(v1

u)

−

(23)

on receiving the transferred mass ∆m can be associated
with an impulse F1∆t received from an external force

(24)

This variable mass equation of motion holds whether or
not the system is conservative.

In a similar way, one can show that subchain 2 on emit-

ting the transferred mass experiences an external force

d

(m2v2)

(25)

Note how these well-known “rocket” equations take the
same form whether the rocket is emitting or absorbing
masses. Since the total chain mass M = m1 + m2 is
constant, the sum of these variable mass equations is just
the simple Newton’s equation

F = F1 + F2 = ˙P,

(26)

for the center of mass of the entire chain. We see that
the internal forces due to mass transfer always cancel out
for any choice of u when the total mass M is constant.41
The velocity u of the mass transfer is not arbitrary,
however. It too is determined uniquely by the chain ten-
sion term in Lagrange’s equation of motion constructed
in the last section. For the falling bungee chain, we ﬁnd

while for the chain falling from a resting heap, it is

(28)

Thus u = v/2 for both falling chains. The two chains do
diﬀer in that while the falling bungee chain has a bent in
it to suggest that the bent is the natural location of mass
transfer, there is no such obvious choice for the chain
falling from a heap. The commonality in both falling
chains is that the transfer is made at the mean veloc-
ity u = (v1 + v2)/2 of the two subchains, according to
Lagrange’s equation of motion for each falling chain.

We now prove that this result is not accidental, but is
actually required for kinetic energy conservation. To sim-
plify the physical situation, let us consider a mass trans-
fer that occurs “instantaneously” at the same height so
that the gravitational force is not involved. Momentum
is then conserved at each subchain. For the receiving
subchain, momentum conservation gives p1f = p1i, or

∆v1 =

∆m1

(u

v1).

The receiving process at subchain 1 is a totally inelastic
collision that involves a kinetic energy change of

K1i ≈ −
to ﬁrst order in the ∆s. Here the kinetic energy K1i in
the initial state includes the kinetic energy u2∆m/2 of
the absorbed mass ∆m. The net change in kinetic energy
is just Carnot’s energy loss.11

(30)

−

At the emitting subchain 2, momentum is also con-

served, thus giving

∆v2 =

The resulting kinetic energy change can be shown to be

K2i ≈ −
Again the ﬁnal kinetic energy K2f at subchain 2 includes
the kinetic energy u2∆m/2 of the emitted mass ∆m.

−

Examination of these results shows that the total
change in kinetic energy ∆K = ∆K1 + ∆K2 vanishes
only when the mass ∆m = ∆m1 =
∆m2 is transferred
at the mean velocity u = (v1 +v2)/2. In other words, the
conservation of kinetic energy is enforced when u takes
on this mean value. Under the circumstances, the mass
emission step is an exact time reverse of the mass ab-
sorption step. Hence the kinetic energy is conserved for
the entire emission-absorption process. (The kinetic en-
ergy is also conserved for any u when v1 = v2, but this
solution is of no interest in our problems.)

Conversely, since we already know by Lagrange’s crite-
ria or theorem [Eq.(1)] that our falling chains are conser-
vative systems, we can actually conclude that the mass
transfer must have taken place elastically at the mean
velocity u = (v1 + v2)/2 even without an actual exami-
nation of Lagrange’s equation. This also shows that Cay-
ley’s assumption of inelastic impacts24 is incorrect.

5

A related result occurs in elastic collisions where the
internal forces are equal and opposite. As a result, “the
kinetic energy lost in compression balances exactly the
kinetic energy gained in restitution. This is sometimes
called the third theorem of Carnot.”42 Since we know
that our falling chains are conservative systems, it follows
that the mass transfer taken as a whole constitutes a
totally elastic collision.

−

One ﬁnal point needs clariﬁcation. We have found in
the last section that the bent in the chain exerts an
µv2/4 on the right arm, ac-
upward tension TR =
cording to Eq.(14). This might appear a little counter-
intuitive until one realizes that it is the rocket engine
µv2/2 on the other side of the equation
term ˙mRv =
of motion that generates the dominant force pulling the
right arm down when the term is moved to the force side
of the equation! This is why the resulting acceleration
exceeds g.

−

In the chain falling from a heap, the situation is “up-
side down”, and also a time reverse of the falling bungee
chain. The mass transfer occurs at the top where the
chain falls down link by link into the moving arm. Both
the chain tension and the rocket engine term there have
signs opposite to those in the falling bungee chain be-
cause the falling arm is gaining mass here. The rocket
˙mdv = µv2, when moved to the other side
engine term,
of the equation, dominates to give a net upward pointing
braking force that prevents the falling chain from falling
as fast as g. However, it is the the down-pointing chain
tension term that pulls the chain down with an acceler-
ation greater than g/3.

To summarize, we have found that in each falling chain,
the chain tension has the value that enforces energy con-
servation because the kintic energy of the falling chain is
a function only of x and v, but not of time explicitly.

IV. THE CHAIN TENSION AT THE SUPPORT

The chain tension T of the falling bungee chain at the
support S can be calculated from Eqs.(26) and (12) using
F = M g

T . The result,1,17,18,19

is a positive monotonic function of ˆx that increases to

∞
Calkin and March1 have studied experimentally the
tension T of a linked chain with N = 81 links. They
measure a maximal tension of 25M g as the chain ap-
proaches the bottom. To understand this result within a
simple theoretical framework, we shall assume that the
theoretical tension (33) of the ideal chain (with N
)
→ ∞
holds until the last link remains standing upright. The
chain tension at that moment is T (79/81) = 11.1M g.

The tip of the last link will next fall a distance of
2ℓ = L
x, where ℓ = L/N is the link length. It does so
by rotating about a pivot at the contact point between

−

the last two links. This rotation can be separated into
two steps: ﬁrst a quarter turn to a horizontal position,
and then a second quarter turn to the hanging position
at the bottom of its travel. To keep the chain CM falling
straight down, the lower part of the left arm sways side-
ways to some maximal displacement after the ﬁrst quar-
ter turn, and then sways back at the second quarter turn.
This sideway motion will not change the vertical tension.
In the ﬁrst quarter turn, the falling chain tip is still
above the pivot, meaning that fractions of the rotating
link are still coming to rest against the left arm until the
last link is horizontal. Hence the theoretical tension (33)
can be expected to hold until ˆx = 80/81, where T has
almost doubled to 21.2M g.

In the second and ﬁnal quarter turn, the chain tip is
below the pivot. The speed of the chain tip continues to
increase, but now only by a freely falling rotation. The
main consequence of this ﬁnal quarter turn is to con-
vert the vertical velocity ˙x to a slightly larger horizontal
velocity as the chain tip reaches bottom. At that mo-
ment, the chain tension T has increased by the weight
M g/N of the last link. Since this ﬁnal increase is quite
small, our simple-minded analysis yields a ﬁnal result of
about 21M g, in rough agreement with experiment. The
ﬁnal swing of the rotating link is easily reproduced by a
falling chain made up of paper clips.

We believe that the remaining discrepancy comes pri-
marily from approximating the linear density µ of the
chain as uniform when it is not. The Calkin-March
chain is a normal linked chain or miniature marine chain.
Where the links hook into each other, the linear density
increases by at least a factor of two as all four sides of
two links appear in cross section instead of the two sides
of a single link. Counting the bends of the links too,
we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant mass concentration at the linkages.
This means that some of this mass concentration at the
linkage for the last link should be allowed to produce
some tension before the last link falls down from the hor-
izontal position. Furthermore, this eﬀect appears to be
larger than any energy loss caused by possible slippage
at the loose linkages of the chain.

The observed maximum chain tension of 25M g can
be reproduced at the length ˆx = 0.9896, an increase
of 0.0019 from the theoretical value of 80/81 = 0.9877.
Each link in the chain is known to have an inside length
of ℓ = 0.97”. Hence the observed maximum tension is re-
produced if we assume that an additional 0.15” of the last
link is still producing tension according to the theoreti-
cal formula (33) after it falls down through the horizontal
position.

For the convenience of the reader who wants to pursue
the matter further, we note that the link length used
in the experiment matches that of the lightest “proof
coil chain” manufactured by the Armstrong Alar Chain
Corporation43, but that Armstrong chain is too light by
a factor 1.30. The match would be perfect if the material
diameter, i.e., diameter of the metal loop in the link, is
increased from the Armstrong chain value of d = 7/32” to

6

1/4”. This means that the extra length of 0.15” needed
to produce the additional tension is about 0.6d. We leave
it to the reader to determine if this is the correct way to
analyze the discrepancy, and if so, how the result of 0.6d
can be accounted for theoretically.

Our simple-minded interpretation is also consistent
with the general features obtained in the numerical sim-
ulation of a falling bungee chain by Tomaszewski and
Pieranski44. They separate a chain of length L = 1 m
into 51 links, and solve the 51 coupled Lagrange’s equa-
tions numerically. They ﬁnd a maximum velocity of
about 21.5 ms−1 when the last link is falling. In our in-
terpretation, the the maximum velocity is expected to be
v(50/51) = 22.4 ms−1, very close to the computed value.
The numerical solution shows a signiﬁcant amount of os-
cillations in the stationary left arm when the right arm is
falling. This is a feature not included in the simple one-
dimensional treatment using only the falling distance x.
The loss of kinetic energy to oscillations in the left arm
has the correct sign to account for the diﬀerence between
the two theoretical maximal velocities.

In this connection, we should mention that Calkin and
March did not report any dramatic left-arm oscillations
in their falling bungee chain. We also do not ﬁnd them
in a falling bungee chain of paper clips. A falling ball
chain, on the other hand, does show a wave-like vibration
mostly in the lower half of the rebounding chain. This
seems to suggest that the loose linkages in these physical
chains are not conducive to the transport of energy to
the transverse motion of the chain.

V. THE LAST HURRAH

Returning now to the idealized falling bungee chain
that is uniform and inextensible, we ﬁnd its CM kinetic
energy to be:

KCM = M gL

ˆx(1

It increases from 0 at ˆx = 0 to a maximum value at
1/√3 before decreasing to zero again at ˆx = 1.

also increases monotonically, reaching the value M gL/4
at x = L. This is just the kinetic energy lost by the CM
of the chain. Given the energy-conserving solution (12),
it is obvious that W (X) has now appeared as the internal
kinetic energy

is the kinetic energy of the right arm. In a more detailed
model where the excitation of the left arm is also allowed,
part of this missing energy would appear as the excitation
energy of the left arm44

However, at the moment the falling tip of the ideal
chain turns over and straightens against the resting left
arm, even this internal kinetic energy vanishes as the
entire chain comes to rest at full extension. This too has
a simple explanation that is worth repeating: The act of
straightening can be visualized as a completely inelastic
Carnot collision in which the remaining mass ∆m = mR
of the right arm is transferred to the left arm, of mass m.
Momentum conservation in the laboratory requires that

pf = (m + ∆m)∆v = v∆m = pi.

(38)

The resulting kinetic energy change in this totally inelas-
tic collision is

This shows that in the limit x
mass vanishes, all its remaining kinetic energy KR =
M gL/4 is converted into the internal potential energy of
the momentarily resting chain in a single inelastic colli-
sion. For a perfectly inextensible chain suspended from
a rigid support, ∆v must vanish. This means that the
appropriate m must be inﬁnite, including not only the
ﬁnite mass of the left arm but also the inﬁnite mass of
the support.

This is not the end of the story for actual falling bungee
chain, however. If the chain is an ideal spring, it will be
stretched by an amount consistent with overall energy
conservation as the ﬁnal mass transfer takes place. This
stored potential energy will be used to give the chain its
kinetic energy on rebound.

7

In actual chains,

the ﬁnal rebound that follows
Carnot’s energy loss should also appear, even though the
rebound is not completely elastic. This grand ﬁnale is
easily reproduced for a falling bungee chain of paper clips.

VI. CONCLUSION

We conclude by paying homage to the genius of La-
grange whose formulation of classical mechanics helps us
to decide deﬁnitively if a mechanical system is conserva-
tive. We have found that Lagrange’s equation of motion
already contains a unique speciﬁcation of what happens
when masses are transferred between the two parts of a
falling chain, a speciﬁcation that actually enforces energy
conservation in the falling chain.

Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) was born Giuseppe
Lodovico Lagrangia45 in Turin of Italian-French parents.
He introduced purely analytic methods to replace the
cumbersome geometrical arguments then commonly used
in calculus. Using this algebraic method, he and his con-
temporary Leonhard Euler founded the calculus of vari-
ations as a special branch of mathematics where a func-
tion that minimizes an integral is to be constructed.46 In
his masterpiece M´ecanique analytique (1788),12 Lagrange
discarded Newton’s geometrical approach and recast all
of mechanics in algebraic form in terms of generalized
coordinates whose motion satisﬁes a variational princi-
ple, the principle of virtual work. He emphasized in the
preface of this monumental book that “No ﬁgures will be
found in this work ... only algebraic operations ...”.47,48
He was one of the greatest mathematicians of the 18th
century, perhaps its greatest49. Truesdell, an admirer of
Euler, faults the Lagrangian formulation for excessive ab-
stractness that “conceals the main conceptual problems
of mechanics”.50

On the puzzling issues in the physics of falling chains,
however, we have seen in this paper how Lagrange’s
method gives deﬁnitive answers with unmatched ease,
clarity and elegance.

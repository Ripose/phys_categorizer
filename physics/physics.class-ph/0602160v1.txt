Abstract. We analyse the motion of a sphere that rolls without slipping on a conical
surface having its axis in the direction of the constant gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth.
This nonholonomic system admits a solution in terms of quadratures. We exhibit that
the only circular of the system orbit is stable and furthermore show that all its solutions
can be found using an analogy with central force problems. We also discuss the case
of motion with no gravitational ﬁeld, that is, of motion on a freely falling cone.

1. Introduction

Rigid body motion has always been an interesting and very usable subject of classical
mechanics [1, 2]. Many subtle points of dynamics and of mathematical techniques for
studying the behaviour of physical systems can be learned by studying the motion of
rigid bodies. On this matter see, for example, [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Part of the interest
of today comes from the insight that can be gained on the behaviour of spinning asteroids
or artiﬁcial satellites and, furthermore, rigid body motion can be chaotic [11, 12, 13].
Besides, many everyday phenomena can be understood in terms of rigid body motion
at least in a ﬁrst approximation. For example, balls rolling on inclines, motion in
toboggans, bowls in a bowling alley, the motion of snow boarders, the dynamics of
bicycles or wheels, the behaviour of billiard balls, and so on. Though the importance
of rigid bodies is clear, some of the problems involving rolling particles on a surface are
often modelled in beginning courses as point particles sliding on surfaces [6, 14]. This
modelling is an appropriate pedagogical device in introductory courses but we want to
show here that the problems can be addressed using a rigid body approach in more
advanced courses.

In this work we analyse the motion of a sphere that rolls without slipping on the
inside of a right circular cone under the inﬂuence of a uniform gravitational ﬁeld acting
verically downwards, in the direction of the symmetry axis of the cone. The motion
of a spherical body rolling without slipping on surfaces of revolution has been recently
studied with the purpose of illuminating control processes [10]. Here our aim is to
study the motion of a sphere on the inner surface of a conical surfaceas an exactly
solvable example of rigid body motion. We obtain the general solution of this problem
expressing it in quadratures. We analyse certain qualitative features of the motion, like
the existence of a stable circular orbit, establishing an analogy with particle motion in a
central force ﬁeld in two dimensions. For the case of a conical surface in free fall we ﬁnd
that the general solution of the problem can be casted in terms of expressions similar
to those deﬁning sets of ellipses and hyperbolas. We also calculate the apsidal (apogee)
angle of the center of mass (CM) motion to ﬁnd the orbit’s symmetry axes and argue
that the sphere’s CM trajectory densely ﬁlls a strip on the conical surface.

2. The equations of motion

To describe the position of the sphere’s centre of mass (CM), we choose a Cartesian
coordinate system (x, y, z) such that the origin of coordinates is at the position of the
sphere’s centre of mass (CM) when the sphere simply rests on the cone (that is, it
corresponds to the vertex of the imaginary cone —shown dashed in ﬁgure 1— on which
the CM moves); the coordinates are then (see Figure 1)

x = r sin α cos ϑ,

y = r sin α sin ϑ,

z = r cos α,

(1)

Sphere rolling on the surface of a cone

Figure 1. The cone on which the sphere of radius a rolls is shown in a continuous
black line. The dashed cone is the imaginary cone on which the sphere’s centre of mass
(CM) moves. The imaginary cone is the same as the actual one but displaced upwards
a distance a csc α. The origin of coordinates is chosen as the vertex of the imaginary
cone so the vertex of the actual cone is at z0 =
a csc α. The ﬁgure also shows the
CM generalised coordinates r and ϑ. The radius of the parallel circle containing the
CM is symbolised by ρ.

−

π/2, α = π/2
where α is half the angle of aperture of the cone —therefore, 0
corresponds to motion on a plane, whereas α = 0 to motion on a cylindrical surface—,
r is the distance from the origin to the CM, and ϑ is the polar angle of the sphere’s CM.
All these relations may be seen from ﬁgure 1. The tangential components of the CM
velocity, in the, respectively, meridional and parallel directions to the conical surface
(using a sort of geographical terminology), are

u = ˙r,
v = r sin α ˙ϑ.

where M is the mass, I = 5Ma2/2, is the moment of inertia of the sphere, a its radius;
g is the acceleration of gravity, and φ, θ and ψ are Euler’s angles [1]. Lagrangian (3)
with u, v, and z deﬁned appropriately, is fairly general; the description it gives is valid
for an arbitrary surface of revolution with a sphere rolling on its surface.

The motion of the sphere is further constrained according to u

ˆe1 = 0,
ˆe2 = 0, where ω is the angular velocity vector of the sphere, and
and v + aω
ˆe1 = (sin α cos ϑ, sin α sin ϑ, cos α), ˆe2 = (
sin ϑ, cos ϑ, 0) are unit vectors in the,
respectively, direction of the meridional line and the parallel circle on the cone. The

vector ω can be written in terms of the Euler angles, an expression that can be found in
many textbooks [1, 2, 3]. If we employ equations (2) for substituting u and v, we obtain

these two relations just mean that the sphere rolls with no slipping on the surface of
the cone.

where ρ is the radius of curvature of the parallel circle at point of contact: ρ = r sin α,
κ = cos α/ρ, and ω

ω3 is the component of ω normal to the cone.
The ﬁrst two equations above are essentially Newton’s second law for the centre of
mass of the sphere, the third one is its rotating counterpart for a rotating rigid sphere.
With the help of the constrictions, the Euler’s angles have been eliminated from the
description.

3. Conserved Quantities in the Motion of the Sphere

It should be clear that the total energy, E, of the sphere is a constant of motion since we
are neglecting any dissipative eﬀects. The energy of the sphere can be obtained directly
from equations (5),

E =

M(u2 + v2) +

Iω2 +

Mgz.

We note in passing that this expression (6) is valid, again with u and v properly deﬁned,
for any surface of revolution. The point z = 0 has been chosen as the point of zero
potential energy [1, 10]. It can be worth noting that the factor 7/10 in the CM’s kinetic
energy, instead of the usual 1/2, comes from eﬀects associated with the rolling-but-no-
slipping condition.

For arbitrary surfaces of revolution, the energy is the only constant of motion. But
in our conical case it is simple to show, using the equations of motion (5), that the
z-component of the angular momentum of the center of mass (CM) is also a constant
of the motion,

Lz = Mρv = Mρ2 ˙ϑ.

with b and c constants coming from the parametrization, in cylindrical coordinates, of

where l = Iω is the angular momentum of the sphere respect to the normal to the
surface of revolution at the point of contact and ω the rotational angular speed around
this same axis. In the conical surface b is the slope of the generatrix and c is the z-
coordinate of its vertex. The easiest way of showing that (8) is a constant is by taking
its t-derivative and using (5) to show that it vanishes.
In is also worth pinpointing
a csc α since the sphere is geometrically constrained—i. e. we are
that z
assuming that it is not possible for the sphere to cut through the surface of the cone; z0
being the z-coordinate of the vertex of the cone on which the sphere is rolling.

(=

−
r2—the turning points where ˙r vanishes. This ﬁgure shows the typical behaviour of Veﬀ.
A glance to ﬁgure 2 thus shows that the motion is restricted between the two turning
points, meaning that the sphere’s CM moves on a strip bounded by two parallel circles
on the conical surface.

E

The graph of Veﬀ, ﬁgure 2, also shows a minimum value at rc. That is, an stable
circular orbit is possible at this distance rc. The actual radius of the circular orbit, as
measured from the cone’s symmetry axis, is ρc = rc sin α.

where r1 corresponds to the ﬁrst turning point and the double sign corresponds to the
clockwise and counterclockwise rotations, respectively. Equations (16) and (17) are the
general form of the solution of the problem in terms of quadratures. The integrals (17)
and (16) can be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals of the ﬁrst and of the second
kind, but such expressions do not oﬀer much insight into the properties of the motion.
However, a simple analysis of ﬁgure 2 says that the motion is always bounded between
r1 and r2, and that, for given E, h, and Lz, there can be only one circular orbit which
besides is stable. To determine the radius, rc, of this orbit we must take ˙u = 0 —which
means that the acceleration, and thus the force, in the r-direction vanishes— in (5) to
get

the suﬃx c meaning magnitudes evaluated on the parallel circle r = rc. Since the ﬁrst
term in equation (18) is always positive and cos α > 0 because 0 < α < π/2, the circular
orbit is only possible when the initial conditions are such that

Equation (18) is quite useful since it allows evaluating any one of the three quantities
˙ϑc, or ωc as a function of initial conditions of the remaining two for starting the
rc,
motion on the circular orbit. If we know the initial values ω0 and ˙ϑ0, we could ascertain
whether equation (18) has a solution or not, just by checking if those initial values satisfy
equation (19). Clearly equation (19) holds if ω0 and ˙ϑ0 have contrary signs independent
of their magnitudes. Now equation (18) has one solution for ωc with initial conditions
r0 and ˙ϑ0 while it has two solutions with initial conditions r0 and ω0 one of opposite
sign to ω0 and another of the same sign, but satisfying equation (19).

This is a cubic equation for rc that has always a real positive root; but let us pinpoint
c g sin2 α. The
that, due to condition (19), this equation is only valid when 2hLz < 5Mr2
existence of only one real and positive root, follows from the fact that the last term in
(20) is less than zero, whereas the coeﬃcient of the ﬁrst term is positive [15]. However,
it can be much simpler to just take a look at ﬁgure 2, as it exhibits that there is one
and only one circular orbit on the surface.

There is a further point worth mentioning, the existence of a relationship between
the radius of the circular orbit and the r-values of the turning points, ri, i = 1, 2,

therefore the equations of motion of the sphere are found, as we did in section 4,
analogous to the equations of motion of a particle in a central force ﬁeld. The variables
r(t) and ϕ(t) can be considered as the polar coordinates of a particle moving on a plane
under the action of the “central” force f (r) given in equation (23). If, additionally we
assume the cone is in free fall, that is, that g = 0, then the orbit of the center of the
sphere, r = r(ϕ), can be easily obtained by rewriting equation (22) in terms of ϕ, using
the relations

6. Conclusions

We have studied the motion of a sphere rolling on the inner surface of a right circular cone
with opening angle α under the assumption that it does not slip. The motion was ﬁrst
considered under the action of gravity and we managed to obtain an implicit solution in
quadratures. We established the existence of bounded motions and of circular orbits in
the system analysing an eﬀective potential in which the equivalent single particle system
moves. With the help of this eﬀective potential we were able to reduce the problem to
quadratures obtaining implicitly r(t) and thus θ(t).

However, to actually integrate the equations of motion for obtaining the centre’s
of mass orbit in terms of elementary functions, we required changing to a freely falling
frame. In such a frame we have been able to obtain solutions for the CM orbit analogous
to ones in a related central problem. We have been able to show, with the help of this
relation, that the CM can move on hyperbolic or on preceding elliptic, but never on
parabolic orbits.

The analogy between motions in our system with central-ﬁeld motion and specially
with an inhomogeneous oscillator in the freely falling case, should be pointed out as
interesting and quite amusing. This aspect of the behaviour has a certain pedagogical
signiﬁcance as can serve to emphasise that the same equations have always the same
solutions; it does not really matter that we are describing diﬀerent physical systems.

INTRODUCTION

A quantum mechanical version of Newton’s second
law has existed for some time [1, 2]. By substituting
ψ = √f eiS/¯h into Schrodinger’s equation, it is possible
to arrive at a continuity equation,

is a quantum mechanical potential energy [1, 2]. Here,
ψ is the wavefunction, f is the probability density, V
is the classical potential energy, r is the conﬁguration
space coordinate vector, t is time, m is the particle’s
mass, i = √
1, ¯h = h/(2π), and h is Planck’s constant.
This type of formulation has been used as the basis of
a signiﬁcant number of recent studies [3, 4]. Although
Newton’s second law describes the trajectory of a point
particle, Newton’s second law may also be used to obtain
a wave equation that describes the quantum states of a
relativistic spinless particle.

II. PRELIMINARIES

As a starting point,

it is assumed that a time-
dependent probability density in conﬁguration space,
f (r, t), and a time-dependent probability density in mo-
mentum space, gp(p, t), describe the state of a spin-
less particle. A wavevector k is deﬁned in relation to
momentum p by p = ¯hk. Wavefunctions in conﬁgu-
ration space, momentum space, and wavevector space,
denoted ψ(r, t), χp(p, t), and χk(k, t), respectively, are
deﬁned in relation to probability densities in conﬁgu-
ration space, momentum space, and wavevector space,
denoted f (r, t), gp(p, t), and gk(k, t), respectively, such
that f (r, t) = ψ∗(r, t)ψ(r, t), gp(p, t) = χ∗

Equation (19) may be considered a wave equation, be-
cause p and p2 represent diﬀerential expressions that
contain the wavefunction ψ. Equation (19) applies even
when the presence of a nonconservative force does not
allow a potential energy to be deﬁned.

pf (r, t)d3r, where p represents a diﬀer-

ing p = mv/
ond law, F = dp/dt, where F is the sum of the forces
that act on the particle, and dp/dt is the time rate of
change of the particle’s relativistic momentum. With

For ψ = ψ(r, t), Eq. (24) is satisﬁed if the numera-

For a stationary state, Eq. (20) is written as ∇[p2/(2m)+

∂t = 0 and Eq. (23) are used. The ex-
pression ∇[p2/(2m) + V ] = 0 is satisﬁed by a spatially
constant classical energy E = p2/(2m) + V . Upon sub-
stituting ψ into E = p2/(2m) + V , the resulting equa-
tion can be written as the time-independent version of

VII. CONCLUSION

In summary, a way to arrive at Schrodinger’s equa-
tion from Newton’s second law was developed by writing
momentum expressions as diﬀerential expressions. New-
ton’s second law was used to write a force equation,
Eq. (19), which represents a wave equation that describes
the quantum states of a relativistic spinless particle.
Equation (19) was used to obtain Schrodinger’s equation
(both time-dependent and time-independent versions) in
the nonrelativistic limit and for a conservative force. Rel-
ativistic versions of both versions of Schrodinger’s equa-
tion were obtained.

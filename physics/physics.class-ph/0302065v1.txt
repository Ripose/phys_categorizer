Abstract

Newton’s law of motion for a particle of mass m subject to a force f acting
at time t may be formulated either as

or, since m = m0 is a constant, as

f = d/dt (mu(t))

f = ma(t)

where u(t) and a(t) are the velocity and the acceleration, respectively, of the
particle at time t relative to an inertial frame S,
‘the laboratory’. This law
may be interpreted in either of two ways:

(1) The force f acting on the particle at time t during an inﬁnitesimal time
δt imparts to the laboratory a boost δu = (1/m)f δt, while the particle
maintains the velocity u(t) relative to the new frame S′.

(2) The force f acting on the particle at time t during an inﬁnitesimal time
δt imparts to the particle a boost δw = (1/m)f δt relative to its proper
frame S0 which moves with velocity u(t) relative to S.

We show that the relativistic law of motion admits both interpretations, the
ﬁrst of which is in fact equivalent to the law of motion. As a consequence,
we show that the relativistic law of motion may also be reformulated as

f = ma

in analogy with Newton’s law, but with a relativistic mass and a relativistic
acceleration deﬁned in terms of the relativistic addition law of velocities,
rather than ordinary mass and ordinary vectorial addition of velocities that
lead to the classical acceleration and to Newton’s law.

Introduction

It is well-known that the Special Theory of Relativity is based on two postu-
lates: the principle of relativity and the constancy of the speed of light. From
these postulates, one can deduce the Lorentz transformations that connect
the space-time coordinates of a particular event in two inertial frames. From
these transformations, in turn, lenght contraction, time dilation, the ‘addi-
tion’ formula for velocities, etc., follow straightforwardly (see e.g [2], [4], [5],
[6]). Thus, these postulates are suﬃcient for the development of the theory
as far as kinematics is concerned.

On the other hand, this is not so for dynamics.

In the earlier papers,
the law of motion was obtained from electrodynamical considerations. After
a tortuous path, Planck and independently Tolman, ﬁnally arrived at the
familiar formulation of today connecting force, mass and velocity at a given
time:

f = d/dt(mu(t))
m = m0γ(u)

γ(u) = 1/

q
The time t, the mass m, the force f and the velocity u(t) are relative to an
inertial frame S. (See [1], [2], [3] and [5] for historical references).

In his lecture on ‘Space and Time’ (see [2]), delivered in 1908 and pub-
lished a year later, Minkowski introduced an invariant reformulation of the
usual law of motion:

F = m0A

2

where F is the 4-force acting on the particle and A the 4-acceleration.

It should be noticed, however, that F is a 4-force and thus diﬀers from
the 3-force f . Even the spatial component (F1, F2, F3) of Minkowski 4-force
diﬀers from the previously introduced 3-forces. In fact

The corresponding spatial component of the 4-acceleration is therefore

(F1, F2, F3) = γ(u)f

(A1, A2, A3) = γ(u)d/dt(γ(u)u)

The time components of the Minkowski force and the acceleration are given
by F4 = (γ(u)/c)f.u and A4 = cγ(u)d/dt(γ(u)). The equation F4 = m0A4
follows from the corresponding equation for the spatial component and is in
fact equivalent to f .dr = c2dm, as shown by an easy calculation.

The arguments generally given in favor of the usual law of motion are

(see [7]):

(i) it reduces to the law of Newton f = ma in the classical limit

(ii) it leads to the conservation of momentum in simple collisions, provided

that we assume the law of equality of action and reaction at contact

(iii) it leads to δE = c2δm, the inﬁnitesimal version of Einstein’s famous
law E = mc2 by adopting the classical deﬁnition of work as f orce
distance, as we will see later on.

×

(iv) it is consistent with the well-established Lorentz law of force in electro-

dynamics

These are strong arguments not only in favor of the usual law of motion, but
(iii) and (iv) provide good reasons to consider also the 3-force (along with
the Minkowski 4-force ).

The aim of this note is to show that this law of motion admits the two
interpretations of Newton’s law stated in the Abstract. To formulate them
in a concise manner, we shall use the diagram

as a shorthand to describe the following situation: the particle P moves with
velocity u′ relative to S′, which itself moves with velocity v relative to S and
u is the velocity of the particle relative to S. It will be particularly handy
when we deal with relativity and Lorentz transformations.

To simplify the notation, we shall use either ∂t or

˙(...) for d/dt. i.e., the

derivative with respect to time.

Newtonian Dynamics

Newton’s law of motion for a particle of mass m subject to a force f acting
at time t is

f = ∂t(mu(t))
where u(t) is the velocity of the particle at time t relative to an inertial
system S, to be referred to as ‘the laboratory’.

This law can be rewritten as

u(t + δt) = u(t) + (1/m)f δt

by letting δt an inﬁnitesimal time increment and using

u(t + δt) = u(t) + ˙u(t)δt

Now, the point is that this law may be interpreted in either of two equivalent
ways:

(1) The force f acting on the particle at time t during an inﬁnitesimal lapse
of time δt imparts to the laboratory S , relative to which the particle
has velocity u(t), a boost δu = (1/m)f δt while the particle maintains
the velocity u(t) relative to the new frame S′. Thus, the new velocity
of the particle relative to S at time t + δt is

u(t + δt) = (1/m)f δt + u(t)

the new velocity of the particle relative to S at time t + δt is

u(t + δt) = u(t) + (1/m)f δt

Relativistic Dynamics

As we mentioned already, in Special Relativity Newton’s law of motion is
replaced by

f = ∂t(mu(t))
m = m0γ(u)

From now on, we choose a system of unities such that c = 1. Thus γ(u) =
1/√1

u2.

We wish here to point out a suggestive interpretation of the law of motion
which does not seem to have been noticed before. In fact, we wish to point
out that this law admits precisely the two previous interpretations, provided
that we take care to refer all quantities to the corresponding frames, since
force, mass and time are frame-dependent, contrary to the classical case, and
is not
take into account the fact that relativistic composition of velocities
commutative. Unlike the Newtonian case, however, only the ﬁrst interpreta-
tion is equivalent to the law of motion. The second, although a consequence
of this law, does not seem to be equivalent to it.

But from the law of motion f = ∂t(mu) (and m = m0γ), it follows easily
that f = mal which in turn, implies the right hand side. But the right hand
side is true, since it is precisely the Lorentz transformation of the force, as
deduced from the law of motion (see the Appendix)

To show that, conversely, the ﬁrst interpretation (together with m = m0γ)
implies the relativistic law of motion, notice that from the ﬁrst interpreta-
tion, (1/m)f δt = alδt, which in turn implies f = mal, a formula which is
obviously equivalent (by taking derivatives) to f = ∂t(mu(t), provided that
m = m0γ.

Thus, we may reformulate the relativistic law of motion as

f = mal

where m = m0γ is the relativistic mass of the particle and al is the relativistic
”left acceleration”.

The second interpretation, (1/γm0)f 0 = ar, can be written in a way that

is analogous to Newton’s law, namely

f 0 = m0δw0/(δt)0
(since δw0 = 1/m0f 0(δt)0), but with the relativistic ”acceleration” δw0/(δt)0 =
γar. This expression has the following physical interpretation: assume that
an observer attached to the frame S0 moving with the particle let a test
δw0/(δt)0 is the acceleration at the
body ‘fall’ freely relative to S. Then

moment of the take-oﬀ, as measured by this observer in his frame (i.e. S0).
In classical mechanics, this acceleration is implicit in the studies of Huygens
on centrifugal force (De vi centrifuga).
In fact, Huygens imagines a man
attached to a turning wheel and holding a thread tied to a ball of lead in his
hand. The thread is suddenly cut and Huygens studies the motion of the ball
at the instant when the thread is cut. This ”take-oﬀ” acceleration plays an
important role in some historico-critical studies such as those of the ‘Ecole
du ﬁl’ of of F.Reech and J.Andrade (see [1]).

Appendix:Lorentz transformations and com-
position of velocities

We recall the Lorentz transformation that connects the position of an event
in two inertial frames S and S′ such that S′ (or rather its origin) moves with
uniform velocity v with respect to S. Indeed, if (r, t) describes the event in S,
and (r′, t′) describes the same event in S′, then (by mapping these quantities
in an independent Euclidean 3-space):

r′ = r + vγ(v)

(1/c2)γ(v)/(1 + γ(v))v.r

Similarly, if a particle moves with velocity u with respect to S and velocity
u′ with respect to S′, then

u′ =

Finally, if the particle is subject to a force f relative to S, then relative to
S′ the force is given by

Acknowledgments

The ﬁrst author owes a great debt of gratitude to Nicanor Parra. He formu-
lated clearly the problem of the status of the 3-force and the law of motion in
the Theory of Special Relativity and told him about the take-oﬀ acceleration
in classical mechanics, suggesting that it could be used in Special Relativity.
He had countless conversations on and oﬀ on ‘natural and supernatural’ me-
chanics, since he followed Parra’s course in 1957 at the Instituto Pedag´ogico
of the Universidad de Chile in Santiago. His encouragement is greatly appre-
ciated. He is also in debt to Jorge Krausse. Besides discussions of a general
nature, he helped him to ﬁnd his way in the literature on Relativity Theory.

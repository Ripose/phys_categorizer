Abstract

We reexamine a very classical problem, the spinning behavior of the
tippe top on a horizontal table. The analysis is made for an eccentric
sphere version of the tippe top, assuming a modiﬁed Coulomb law for
the sliding friction, which is a continuous function of the slip velocity vP
at the point of contact and vanishes at vP = 0. We study the relevance of
the gyroscopic balance condition (GBC), which was discovered to hold
for a rapidly spinning hard-boiled egg by Moﬀatt and Shimomura, to the
inversion phenomenon of the tippe top. We introduce a variable ξ so that
ξ = 0 corresponds to the GBC and analyze the behavior of ξ. Contrary
to the case of the spinning egg, the GBC for the tippe top is not fulﬁlled
initially. But we ﬁnd from simulation that for those tippe tops which will
turn over, the GBC will soon be satisﬁed approximately. It is shown that
the GBC and the geometry lead to the classiﬁcation of tippe tops into
three groups: The tippe tops of Group I never ﬂip over however large a
spin they are given. Those of Group II show a complete inversion and
the tippe tops of Group III tend to turn over up to a certain inclination
angle θf such that θf < π, when they are spun suﬃciently rapidly. There
exist three steady states for the spinning motion of the tippe top. Giving
a new criterion for stability, we examine the stability of these states in
terms of the initial spin velocity n0. And we obtain a critical value nc
of the initial spin which is required for the tippe top of Group II to ﬂip
over up to the completely inverted position.

1 Introduction

Spinning objects have historically been interesting subjects to study. The spin
reversal of the rattleback [1] (also called a celt or wobblestone) and the behavior of

the tippe top are typical examples. In the latter case, when a truncated sphere with
a cylindrical stem, a so-called ‘tippe top’, is spun suﬃciently rapidly on a table with

its stem up, it will ﬂip over and rotate on its stem. This inversion phenomenon has
fascinated physicists and has been studied for over a century [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

In the present paper we revisit and study this very classical problem from a
diﬀerent perspective. Recently the riddle of spinning eggs has been resolved by
Moﬀatt and Shimomura [MS] [10]. They discovered that if an axisymmetric body,

such as a hard-boiled egg, is spun suﬃciently rapidly, a ‘gyroscopic balance’ condition
(GBC) holds and that under this condition the governing equations of the system

are much simpliﬁed. In particular, they derived a ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential
equation (ODE) for θ, the angle between the axis of symmetry and the vertical axis,

and showed for the case of a prolate spheroid that the axis of symmetry indeed
rises from the horizontal to the vertical. Then the spinning behavior of egg-shaped

axisymmetric bodies, whose cross sections are described by several models of oval
curves, was studied under the GBC by one of the present authors [11].

The tippe top is also an axisymmetric body and shows the similar behavior as

the spinning egg. Then one may ask: does the GBC also hold for the tippe top?
If so, how is it related to the inversion phenomenon of the tippe top? In the ﬁrst

half of this paper we analyze the spinning motion of the tippe top in terms of the
GBC. Actually the GBC is not satisﬁed initially for the tippe top, contrary to the

case of the spinning egg. The diﬀerence comes from how we start to spin the object:
we spin the tippe top with its stem up, in other words, with its symmetry axis
vertical while the egg is spun with its symmetry axis horizontal. In this paper we

perform our analysis taking an eccentric sphere version of the tippe top instead of a
commercially available one, a truncated sphere with a cylindrical stem. In order to

examine the GBC of the tippe top more closely, we introduce a variable ξ so that
ξ = 0 corresponds to the GBC, and study the behavior of ξ. Numerical analysis

shows that for the tippe tops which will turn over, the variable ξ, starting from a

1

|

ξm/ξ0| ≈

large positive value ξ0, soon takes negative values and ﬂuctuates around a negative
but small value ξm such that
0. Thus for these tippe tops, the GBC, which
is not satisﬁed initially, will soon be realized but approximately. On the other hand,
in the case of the tippe tops which will not turn over, ξ remains positive around
ξ0 or changes from positive ξ0 to negative values and then back to positive values
close to ξ0 again. We ﬁnd that the behavior of ξ is closely related to the inversion
phenomenon of the tippe top. Once ξ ﬂuctuates around the value ξm, the system
becomes unstable and starts to turn over.

Under the GBC the governing equations for the tippe top are much simpliﬁed

and we obtain a ﬁrst-order ODE for θ, which has the same form as the one derived
by MS for the spinning egg. Then, this equation for θ and the geometry lead to the
classiﬁcation of tippe tops into three groups, depending on the values of A
C and a
R ,
where A and C are two principal moments of inertia, and a is the distance from the

center of sphere to the center of mass and R is the radius of sphere. The tippe tops
of Group I never ﬂip over however large a spin they are given. Those of Group II

show a complete inversion and the tippe tops of Group III tend to turn over up to a
certain inclination angle θf such that θf < π, when they are spun suﬃciently rapidly.
This classiﬁcation of tippe tops into three groups and its classiﬁcatory criteria totally

coincide with those obtained by Hugenholtz [3] and Leutwyler [6], both of whom
resorted to completely diﬀerent arguments and methods.

In the latter half of this paper we study the steady states for spinning motion of
the tippe top and examine their stability (or instability). It is well understood that

|

the main source for the tippe top inversion is sliding friction [2, 3], which depends
on the slip velocity vP of the contact point between the tippe top and a table. Often
used is Coulomb friction (see Eq.(2.13)). In fact, Coulomb friction is practical when
is away from zero, but it is undeﬁned for vP = 0. However, we learn that at
vP
|
the steady state of the tippe top, the slip velocity vP necessarily vanishes. In order
to facilitate a linear stability analysis of steady states and also to study the motion
of the tippe top as realistically as possible, we adopt in our analysis a modiﬁed
version of Coulomb friction (see Eq.(2.14)), which is continuous in vP and vanishes
at vP = 0.

2

Actually the steady states of the tippe top and their stability were analyzed by
Ebenfeld and Scheck [ES] [7], who assumed a similar frictional force which is con-
tinuous at vP = 0. They used the total energy of the spinning top as a Liapunov
function. The steady states were found as solutions of constant energy. And the

stability or instability of these states were judged by examining whether the Lia-
punov function assumes a minimum or a maximum at these states. Also recently,

Bou-Rabee, Marsden and Romero [BMR] [9] analyzed the tippe top inversion as
a dissipation-induced instability and, using the modiﬁed Maxwell-Bloch equations
and an energy-momentum argument, they gave criteria for the stability of the non-

inverted and inverted states of the tippe top.

We take a diﬀerent approach to this problem. First, in order to ﬁnd the steady

states for spinning motion of the tippe top, we follow the method used by Moﬀatt,
Shimomura and Branicki [MSB] for the case of spinning spheroids [12]. Then the

stability of these steady states is examined as follows: Once a steady state is known,
the system is perturbed around the steady state. Particularly we focus our attention
on the variable θ, which is perturbed to θ = θs + δθ, where θs is a value at the steady
state and δθ is a small quantity. Using the equations of motion, we obtain, under the
linear approximation, a ﬁrst-order ODE for δθ of the form, δ ˙θ = Hsδθ, where Hs is
expressed by the values of dynamical variables at the steady state. Thus the change
of δθ is governed by the sign of Hs. If Hs is positive (negative),
will increase
(decrease) with time. Therefore, we conclude that when Hs is negative (positive),
then the state is stable (unstable). Using this new and rather intuitive criterion we
argue about the stability of the steady states in terms of the initial spin velocity n0
given at the position near θ = 0. We observe that our results on the stability of the
steady states are consistent with ones obtained by ES and MSB. Then we obtain a
critical value nc of the initial spin which is required for the tippe top of Group II
to ﬂip over up to the completely inverted position at θ = π. Finally we conﬁrm by
simulation our results on the relation between the initial spin n0 and the stability
of the steady states.

relevance to the inversion phenomenon of the tippe top. We also show that the

assumption of the GBC leads to the classiﬁcation of tippe tops into three groups.
Then in Sec. 4 we study the steady states for the spinning motion of the tippe

top and examine their stability. Sec. 5 is devoted to a summary and discussion.
In addition, we present four appendices. In Appendix A, the equations of motion

which are used to analyze the spinning motion of the tippe top are enumerated. In
Appendix B, it is shown that intermediate steady states for the tippe tops of Group
II and Group III are stable when an initial spin n(θ = 0) falls in a certain range.

In Appendix C we demonstrate that our stability criterion for the steady state is
equivalent to the one obtained by ES. And ﬁnally, in Appendix D, we show that

our results on the stability of the vertical spin states are consistent with the criteria
derived by BMR.

2 Equations of motion for tippe tops

A commercially available tippe top is usually a truncated sphere with a cylindrical

stem. Instead we perform our analysis taking a loaded (eccentric) sphere version
of the tippe top. The center of mass is oﬀ center by a distance a. There are no

qualitative diﬀerences between the two. But if applied to the case of a commercial
tippe top with a stem, our assertions would be valid up to the point when the stem
touched the table surface.

Fig. 1 shows the geometry. An axisymmetric tippe top spins on a horizontal
table with point of contact P . We will work in a rotating frame of reference OXYZ,

where the center of mass is at the origin, O. The center S of the sphere with radius
R is at a distance a from the origin. The symmetry axis of the tippe top, Oz, and the

vertical axis, OZ, deﬁne a plane Π, which precesses about OZ with angular velocity
Ω(t) = (0, 0, Ω). Let (φ, θ, ψ) be the Euler angles of the body relative to OZ. Then
we have Ω = ˙φ, where the dot represents diﬀerentiation with respect to time, and θ
is the angle between OZ and Oz. We choose the horizontal axis OX in the plane Π

and thus OY is vertical to Π and inward.

In a rotating frame of reference Oxyz, where Ox is in the plane Π and perpendic-
ular to the symmetry axis Oz and where Oy coincides with OY , the tippe top spins
about Oz with the rate ˙ψ. Since Ω is expressed as Ω =

respectively, n(t) is given by n = Ω cos θ + ˙ψ. The Ox and Oy are not body-ﬁxed
axes but are principal axes, so that the angular momentum, L, is expressed by
AΩ sin θ ˆx + A ˙θˆy + Cnˆz, where (A, A, C) are the principal moments of inertia

We need an information on the frictional force F . It is well understood that the

so that F is continuous in vP and vanishes at vP = 0. Here we choose Λ as a
suﬃciently small number with dimensions of velocity. Note that vP Z = 0 and thus
the Z-component of F is 0.

This completes the presentation of all the necessary equations for the analysis of
the motion of tippe tops. We enumerate all these equations in Appendix A. We need

further the initial conditions. When we play with a tippe top, we usually give it a
rapid spin with its axis of symmetry nearly vertical. So let us choose the following

initial conditions for θ and other angular velocities:

θ0 = θ(t = 0)

˙θ0 = ˙θ(t = 0) = 0

Ω0 = Ω(t = 0) = 0,

the initial condition for the velocity of the center of mass O, we take

u0 = uO(t = 0) = 0 ,

(2.16)

since we usually do not give a large translational motion to the tippe top at the

beginning.

With the above initial conditions (2.15) and (2.16), we analyze the behaviors of

the tippe top using three angular (2.6a-2.6c) and three translational (2.11a-2.11c)
equations of motion, together with the knowledge of the frictional force, a modiﬁed

version of the Coulomb law (2.14), and the velocities (2.8a-2.8c) and (2.9). When
we perform simulations we use the adaptive Runge-Kutta method.

The condition ξ = 0 has been introduced by MS [10] in their analysis of spinning
hard-boiled eggs, and referred to as the GBC. They discovered that the GBC, ξ = 0,

is approximately satisﬁed for the spinning egg and, using this GBC, they resolved a
long standing riddle: when a hard-boiled egg is spun suﬃciently rapidly on a table
with its axis of symmetry horizontal, the axis will rise from the horizontal to the

vertical. We outline how MS found the GBC for the spinning egg [10]. The system
of the spinning egg obeys essentially the same equations of motion as the case of

the tippe top, to be speciﬁc, Eqs.

(2.3) and (2.10). The Y -component of (2.3)

The tippe top shows the similar behavior as the spinning egg. Then one may ask:
does the GBC also hold for the tippe top? We will show that the answer is “partly
no” and “partly yes”. “Partly no” means that the GBC is not satisﬁed initially.

Tippe tops are usually spun with θ0 ≈

approximately hold whenever the tippe top rises, which is the meaning of “partly

yes”. In fact, the argument of MS to derive the GBC for the spinning egg can also
be applied to the tippe top. Thus in a situation where Ω is suﬃciently large and for

sin θ
= 0, the GBC is expected to be satisﬁed. On the other hand, in the case of
the spinning egg, the GBC is approximately satisﬁed initially. We start to spin an
egg with its symmetry axis horizontal, that is, with θ0 ≈
0 and large Ω0.
Hence we ﬁnd n0 ≈

0 for the spinning egg.
We emphasize that the variable ξ initially takes a large positive value for the

tippe top. But our numerical analysis will show that when a tippe top turns over,
ξ soon makes a rapid transition from large positive values to negative values and

starts to oscillate about a small negative value.

Before proceeding with a discussion of this transition of ξ, let us consider the

consequences when the GBC is exactly satisﬁed for the tippe top.

3.2 Consequences of the exact GBC

In a situation where Ω is suﬃciently large and θ is not in the vicinity of 0 or π, the

GBC is realized for the tippe top. Let us consider the case that the exact GBC,
1In this paper we always take the initial spin velocity ˙ψ0 about Oz to be positive and, therefore,
ξ0 is positive.

ξ = 0, is satisﬁed for the tippe top. Then, we have

J = LZh(θ) ,

(3.4)

from (3.3), and LZ = AΩ from the second equation in (3.2). If the angular velocity
Ω around the vertical axis is reduced and, therefore, LZ decreases, Eq.(3.4) tells
us that the height h(θ) of the center of mass from the table increases since J is a
constant, which means the turning over of the tippe top. Diﬀerentiating both sides
of (3.4) by time and using (2.4b) and (2.5c), we obtain a ﬁrst-order ODE for θ,

J ˙θ =

FY h2(θ) .

−

We assume also that the Y -component of uO, the translational velocity of the
center of mass O, in (2.9) is negligible in the ﬁrst approximation as compared with
that of vrotP , and we set vP Y = vrotP Y . We see that numerical simulation supports
this assumption. Then, one can use Eq. (2.8b) and the GBC to eliminate n and Ω,
and obtain vP Y as only a function of the dynamical variable θ as follows:

We now examine the behaviors of tippe tops belonging to each group.

vP Y is positive for θc < θ < π but negative for 0 < θ < θc. So, the angle θc is a

critical point. If a tippe top of Group I is spun on a table with ˙ψ0 ≈
0 and suﬃciently
large Ω0 and with the initial angle θ0 > θc, then θ will increase to π, which means
that the body will eventually spin at θ = π. In the case θ0 < θc, we will see that the
body spins at θ = 0. Depending on the initial value θ0 the body will spin at the end
point θ = 0 or π. Both ends are stable points. Usually we give a spin to the tippe
top at a position with θ0 ≈

(ii) Group II
Commercial tippe tops belong to Group II. A typical graph of

vP Y for a tippe top of
vP Y is positive for 0 < θ < π. Therefore,
Group II is shown in Fig. 2 (b). We see that
the end point at θ = 0 is unstable while the other end at θ = π is a stable point.
e
Once given a suﬃciently large spin at θ0 ≈
0, the tippe top of Group II will turn
over and spin at θ = π. Actually, commercial tippe tops have stems. Thus for those
tops the above statement is valid up to the angle when the stem touches the table.

(iii) Group III
For an example of the tippe top of Group III, we may imagine a prolate spheroid

of the sphere and the mass distribution is nonuniform so that the center of mass is

vP Y is positive for 0 < θ < θf and negative for θf < θ < π. So, both

ends at θ = 0 and π are unstable points, while the angle θf is a ﬁxed point. When the
body is spun suﬃciently rapidly with the initial angle θ0 anywhere, θ will approach

the ﬁxed point θf . Thus the tippe top of Group III, even though given a suﬃciently
large spin at θ0 ≈

0, will never turn over to θ = π but up to the angle θf .

Now it should be emphasized that the argument so far for the classiﬁcation of
tippe tops into three groups is based on the assumption that the GBC, ξ = 0, is

exactly satisﬁed.
It is very interesting to note that the above classiﬁcation into
three groups and its classiﬁcatory criteria totally coincide with those obtained by

Hugenholtz [3] and Leutwyler [6], both of whom resorted to completely diﬀerent
arguments and methods.
In fact, Hugenholtz considered the eﬀect on the tippe
top when a small frictional force is working during the uniform motion and reached

the same conclusion. On the other hand, Leutwyler used Lagrangian formalism
and searched for the minimum of energy for the tippe top under the constraint of

Jellett’s constant (2.7). Finally the behavior of the tippe top under the GBC was
studied earlier by Sakai [15]. Unfortunately, his work was written in Japanese and

is, therefore, not well known. The consequences derived in this subsection partly
overlap with his results.

3.3 The behavior of the variable ξ

As stated before, the GBC is not satisﬁed initially for the tippe top. Actually, the

initial value of ξ is large and positive. We have performed numerical computations
to see the behaviors of ξ and θ in time t. Typical examples are shown in Figs. 3 and
4, where the scale of the left sides is for ξ normalized by the initial value ξ0, while
the scale of the right sides is for θ in radian. Input parameters are for both cases

˙θ0 = Ω0 = 0, and u0 = 0 for both
For initial conditions we choose n0 = 100 rad/sec,
cases, but we take θ0 = 0.1 rad for the simulation shown in Fig.3 and θ0 = 0.01
rad for the one in Fig.4. With these initial conditions we have ξ0 = Cn0 and
a). We show in Fig.5 the trajectories of slip velocity of the contact
J = ξ0(R cos θ0 −
point P in the (vP X, vP Y ) space which are obtained from the above simulations with
(a) θ0 = 0.1 and (b) θ0 = 0.01. The argument in section 3.2 tells us that a tippe top

14

represented by the input parameters (3.12) is classiﬁed into Group II and, therefore,
this tippe top would turn over up to an inverted position, θ = π, when it is given a

suﬃciently large initial spin.

Also plotted in Figs.3 and 4 are the curves ξ+ and ξ−, the expressions of which
are given below. Using Eqs.(3.2-3.3) and replacing Ω and LZ with ξ, θ and J, we ﬁnd
that the X- and Y - components of the rotational equations (2.5a-2.5b) are rewritten

as

θ changes while nutating. We also see that the inﬂection points of θ, where the
condition ¨θ = 0 is satisﬁed, fall on a rather smooth curve about which θ nutates.
At these inﬂection points of θ, the right-hand side (RHS) of Eq.(3.13b) vanishes.
Here we note that, unless sin θ
h(θ)FX may be neglected as

the curve ξ+. The ﬂuctuation of ξ becomes larger but ξ is still positive for a while.
The inclination angle θ decreases rapidly from the initial value θ0 and then starts
to nutate. The amplitude of nutation becomes larger and the minimum value of θ
decreases further. And at a certain point where θ
0, the ﬂuctuation of ξ becomes
so large that ξ takes negative values. Then ξ starts to ﬂuctuate around the curve ξ−
and θ is going to increase while nutating. The ﬂuctuation of ξ is getting smaller as

≈

θ is increasing, but it becomes large again when θ approaches π. We have observed
in Fig.3 that the ﬂuctuation of ξ around the curve ξ+ at the beginning soon shifts to
the one around the curve ξ−. For this rapid transition of ξ, the simulation shows that
the system should pass through the phase where θ
0. When a simulation starts
with a very small initial value θ0 as in Fig.4, then ξ quickly moves to a ﬂuctuation
around the curve ξ−.

which explains a rapid decrease of θ from an initial value θ0.

Along with the rapid decrease of θ, Fig.5 (a) shows that the slip velocity vP
of the contact point P tends to vanish. Then, in this region where θ is small and
vP
0, the term h(θ)FY of the RHS of (3.13a) may be neglected while U(ξ, θ, J)

with a positive constant C1. Although the term h(θ)FY has been neglected to
derive (3.17), the small eﬀect of the frictional force still remains and it produces
the nutation of θ, which in turn gives ξ a ﬂuctuating behavior around the curve ξ+
according to (3.19). Along with nutation, the minimum value of θ further decreases
and so the ﬂuctuation of ξ is getting larger.

Then at a certain point (at t

0.45 sec), the behavior of ξ shifts to the one

with a positive constant C2, and ξ may take negative values. Actually ξ ﬂuctuates
rapidly between positive and negative values. Also, with the shift of the behavior
of ξ, U(ξ, θ, J) turns to always take positive values. In this region, vP Y is small but
positive on the average in time (see Fig.5 (a)). Now taking the time average of both
sides of (3.13a), we see ˙θ, the time average of ˙θ, is positive, since the LHS,
˙ξ sin θ,
may be neglected while h(θ)FY is negative. Thus, from 0.45 sec to 1 sec, θ gradually
increases while nutating. As θ is increasing, the eﬀect of sin θ on ˙ξ in the LHS of
(3.13a) gets weaker and the ﬂuctuation of ξ becomes smaller. In the end ξ oscillates
mildly about a negative value ξ−.

When we start simulation with a very small initial value θ0 = 0.01 rad as in
Fig.4, ξ quickly takes negative values and θ starts to increase. The ﬂuctuations of
ξ and θ are much smaller than those in Fig.3. With a smaller θ0, the center of
mass O receives less recoil from the frictional force F , which explains the smaller
ﬂuctuations for ξ and θ.

So far we have shown the result of the numerical analysis for a tippe top which

belongs to Group II. Given a suﬃciently large spin, the GBC for this tippe top,
which is not fulﬁlled initially, will soon be satisﬁed approximately, and the body
AMgaR/J
will start to turn over. Actually the GBC, ξ = 0, is modiﬁed to ξ = ξm ≡ −
1. This modiﬁcation has an only eﬀect of shifting the positions of θc
and
(3.10) and θf (3.11) slightly.

Empirically we know that when a given spin is not fast enough, the tippe top
does not turn over and stays spinning with its stem up. Later in Sec. 4, we argue

that there exists a critical value for the initial spin given to the tippe tops of Group
II and III. If the initial spin is below this critical value, then even the tippe tops of
Group II and III do not turn over. We have performed similar simulations as those

in Figs. 3 and 4 with the same tippe top and the same initial conditions, except
that the initial spins are below the critical value. In these simulations we ﬁnd that
ξ, starting from a positive ξ0, ﬁrst ﬂuctuates around the negative value ξ− and then
returns to positive values and ﬂuctuates around ξ+, while the inclination angle θ
remains approximately zero. A typical example is shown in Fig. 6, where input
parameters and initial conditions are the same as in Fig. 3 (and thus the tippe

rad/sec. The critical value for the initial spin is given by n1 in (4.18) below and we
have n1 =36 rad/sec for this case.

We also performed simulations for the tippe tops of Group I, which are predicted

the time evolution of ξ and θ for a tippe top belonging to Group I with initial spins
(a) n0 = 100 rad/sec and (b) n0 = 30 rad/sec. Given a large initial spin (Fig. 7(a)),
ξ for a tippe top of Group I stays positive and takes values very close to ξ+. But,
with a small initial spin (Fig. 7(b)), ξ changes from a positive ξ0 to negative and
ﬂuctuates around ξ− for a while, and then back to positive values again. In both
cases the tippe top stays spinning at θ
0.

For completeness we show, in Fig. 8, typical examples of the time evolution
of ξ and θ for a tippe top belonging to Group III with initial spins, (a) n0 = 100
rad/sec and (b) n0 = 15 rad/sec. Input parameters and other initial conditions are
explained in the caption of Fig. 8. The critical value for the initial spin for the tippe
top of Group III is given again by n1 in (4.18) below and we have n1 =23.5 rad/sec

8(a)), the variable ξ for a tippe top of Group III shows a similar behavior as the one
presented in Fig. 3 for the tippe top of Group II. To be speciﬁc, ξ becomes small and
ﬂuctuates around the curve ξ− while θ increases. Note that the tippe top of Group
III never turns over to the inverted position, θ = π. In the simulation of Fig. 8(a),
θ goes up to the asymptotic angle θasymp, which is below the ﬁxed point θf (=2.21
rad.) derived from (3.11). (See also the discussion on the plot in Fig. 10). Given a
smaller initial spin than n1 (Fig. 8(b)), ξ for a tippe top of Group III, starting from
a positive ξ0, ﬂuctuates around the negative value ξ− and then becomes positive
and ﬂuctuates around ξ+, while θ remains approximately zero, a similar behavior as
the one shown in Fig. 6 for the case of a tippe top of Group II with an insuﬃcient
initial spin.

From these numerical analyses we see that the behavior of ξ is closely related to
the inversion phenomenon of the tippe top. As the tippe top turns over, simulation
shows that ξ becomes small (in the sense
1) and takes values
ξm, which implies that the relation (3.4) is approximately satisﬁed.

4 Stability and critical spin

4.1 Steady states

In Sec.3.2 we have studied the behaviors of the spinning tippe top when the gy-
roscopic balance condition ξ = 0 is exactly satisﬁed. The situation corresponds to

the one in which the tippe top is given an inﬁnitely large initial spin. Actually the
initial spin given to the tippe top is ﬁnite and we know empirically that a tippe top

with a small spin is stable and does not turn over. We will now consider how large
an initial spin should be for the tippe top to turn over. For that purpose we will

study the steady states of the tippe top and examine their stability.

Actually the steady states (or the asymptotic states) of the tippe top and their

22

stability were analyzed by Ebenfeld and Scheck [ES] [7]. They used the total energy
of the spinning top as a Liapunov function. Then the steady states were found as so-

lutions of constant energy. The stability or instability of these states was determined
by examining whether the Liapunov function assumes a minimum or a maximum

at these states under the constraint of Jellett’s constant. The tippe top inversion
was also analyzed recently by Bou-Rabee, Marsden and Romero [BMR] [9] as a

dissipation-induced instability. BMR used the modiﬁed Maxwell-Bloch equations
and an energy-momentum argument to determine the stability of the non-inverted
and inverted states of the tippe top.

Here we take a diﬀerent approach to this problem. And we discuss the stability
of the steady states in terms of the initial spin velocity n given at the non-inverted

position θ = 0. Recently, Moﬀatt, Shimomura and Branicki [MSB] made a linear
stability analysis of the spinning motion of spheroids [12]. They identiﬁed the steady

states, and then discussed their stability and found the critical angular velocity
needed for the rise of the body. In order to ﬁnd the steady states of the spinning

tippe top, we adopt the method taken by MSB for the case of spheroids. But for
the stability analysis of the steady states, we develop a new stability criterion which
is diﬀerent from the ones used by ES, BMR and MSB.

Our approach to the stability problem of the tippe top is as follows. Once a
steady state is known, the system is perturbed around the steady state. Particularly

we focus our attention on the variable θ, which is perturbed to

θ = θs + δθ ,

where θs is a value at the steady state and δθ is a small quantity. Using the equations
of motion, we obtain, under the linear approximation, a ﬁrst-order ODE for δθ of

the following form:

δ ˙θ = H

ns, Ωs, θs,

(cid:16)

A
C

,

a
R

δθ ,

(cid:17)

where ns and Ωs are values taken at the steady state. Equation (4.2) implies that the
change of δθ is governed by the sign of the function H. If H is positive (negative),
δθ
|
will increase (decrease) with time. Therefore, we conclude that when H is negative

|

(positive), then the state is stable (unstable). This is the criterion for stability of

(4.1)

(4.2)

the steady state, which we will use in this paper. The stability criterion in this
work is derived from an intuitive analysis of the equations of motion. We check in

Appendices C and D that they are consistent with those derived by ES and BMR
which are based on mathematically rigorous methods.

Superﬁcially the above criterion (4.2) seems quite diﬀerent from the one used

by ES [7], but actually we have found that both are equivalent and, therefore, our
results are consistent with theirs. In Appendix C we will show the equivalence of

both criteria and that the stability conditions of the steady states which we will
obtain coincide with the ones found by ES. After all, ES utilized the total energy

(an integral form) [7], while we will use equations of motion (diﬀerential forms).

The criterion (4.2) for the stability of the tippe top also seems diﬀerent from the
ones used by BMR [9], which were derived from the tippe top modiﬁed Maxwell-

Bloch equations. In order to obtain the stability criteria, both BMR and we linearize
equations of motion about the steady states and use sliding friction, which is assumed

to be an analytic function of the slip velocity, as the main mechanism behind tippe
top inversion. Thus it is well expected that both criteria lead to the consistent

results on the stability of the non-inverted and inverted states. (The stability of the
intermediate states have not been analyzed yet by means of the modiﬁed Maxwell-
Bloch equations). In Appendix D we will show that the expressions of the criteria

provided in BMR become more transparent when they are rewritten in terms of
the parameters and classiﬁcation criteria used in this paper, and that they lead to

the same stability conditions for the vertical spinning states which will be obtained
later by using the criterion (4.2). Besides, although BMR did not mentioned, the

classiﬁcation of tippe tops into three groups, Group I, II, and III, is shown to be
possible through the close examination of the criteria in BMR.

The steady states of the spinning motion of the tippe top are obtained from the
equations of motion (2.6a-2.6c) and (2.11a-2.11c) by setting ˙Ω = ¨θ = ˙θ = ˙n = ˙uOX =
˙uOY = ˙uOZ = 0 [12]. Since we assume that the sliding friction (2.14), i.e., a modiﬁed

4.2.3 Stability of the intermediate state

We have learned in Sec.4.2.1 that the spinning state of Group I at θ = 0 is stable.

a
R(1−

We also know from the discussion in Sec.4.1 that the intermediate steady states of
Group I, if they exist, must occur at θ > θc = cos−1
. This implies that
the spinning motion of Group I near θ = 0 does not shift to a possible intermediate
steady state. On the other hand, the tippe tops of Group II and III become unstable
at θ = 0 when they are spun with a suﬃciently large initial spin n(θ = 0) > n1, where
n1 is given by (4.18), and they will start to turn over. Here we are interested in
the intermediate steady states of the tippe top which are reached from the initial
spinning position near θ = 0. Therefore, in this subsection, we focus on the possible
steady states only for the tippe tops of Group II and III, and examine their stability.

Finally it is emphasized that the spinning state of the tippe top of Group I is
stable at θ = 0 and the top will not turn over from the position near θ = 0. On the

other hand, the tippe top of Group III, when given a suﬃciently large spin near the
position θ = 0, will tend to turn over and approach the steady state at θs but never
up to the inverted position at θ = π.

4.3 Critical spin for inversion of the tippe top of Group II

The tippe top of Group II will turn over to the inverted position at θ = π when it
is given a suﬃcient initial spin. Let us estimate the critical value nc so that the

of Group II to turn over up to θ = π is that the initial spin n(θ = 0) should be

4.4 Numerical analysis

We now study the time evolution of the inclination angle θ from a spinning position
near θ = 0. Simulations are made with various values of A
R, changing the
input parameters A and a. Other input parameters are the same as those given in
(3.12). Initial conditions are θ0 = 0.01 rad, ˙θ0 = Ω0 = 0, and u0 = 0, and the initial
value of the spin velocity n0 is varied. Since we have chosen a very small θ0, we may
consider n0 as n(θ = 0).

and (d) are 34.4(62.9), 42.1(54.5), 45.7(49.4) and 51.4(44.4), respectively. In each
case we see that the spinning state near θ = 0 is stable when n0 < n1. Once n0 gets
larger than n1, the state becomes unstable and the tippe top turns over up to the
asymptotic angle θasymp. For the tippe tops (a) and (b) the values of θasymp grow
with n0 from 0 to π. On the other hand, the tippe top (c) satisﬁes rc < A
C < 1 with
rc = 0.94, and thus the intermediate steady state exists only at θs(= θasymp) with
θd < θs < π, where θd is a solution of F (cos θd) = F (1). We ﬁnd θd = 1.89. Thus

Figure 11: The time evolution of the angle θ for a tippe top of Group II from a
spinning position near θ = 0.

For simulations we have used a modiﬁed version of the Coulomb friction F given
in (2.14). The value θasymp is not aﬀected by the strength of the coeﬃcient µ. The
strength of µ instead has an eﬀect on the rate of rising of the tippe top. If we use
another form than (2.14) for the sliding friction, and moreover, it is expressed as a
continuous function of vP and vanishes at vP = 0, then we still expect that we get
the same numerical results on θasymp vs. n0 as shown in Fig.9 and Fig.10. This is
due to the observation that the numerical value θasymp has fallen on the predicted
curves which are derived from (4.28) and that we have obtained (4.28) using the
property of F which vanishes at the steady states together with vP .

Figure 11 shows the time evolution of the inclination angle θ for a tippe top of
Group II from a spinning position near θ = 0 for various values of the initial spin
velocity n0. Input parameters and initial conditions are the same as before and we
take A
R = 0.15. The asymptotic angles θasymp which will be reached are 0,
0.92, 1.67, 2.49, π and π rad for n0 =30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 rad/sec, respectively.
Simulations with a modiﬁed version of the Coulomb friction (2.14) show that the
larger value of n0 is given, the faster the rate of rising becomes.

5 Summary and Discussion

We have examined an inversion phenomenon of the spinning tippe top, focusing
our attention on its relevance to the gyroscopic balance condition (GBC), which

was discovered by Moﬀatt and Shimomura in the study of the spinning motion of a
hard-boiled egg. In order to analyze the GBC in detail for the case of the tippe top,

we introduce a variable ξ given by (3.1) so that ξ = 0 corresponds to the GBC, and
study the behavior of ξ. Contrary to the case of the spinning egg, the GBC is not

satisﬁed initially for the tippe top. The simulation shows that, starting from a large
positive value ξ0, the variable ξ for the tippe tops which rise, soon ﬂuctuates around
a negative but small value ξm such that
0. Thus for these tippe tops, the
|
GBC, though it is not fulﬁlled initially, will soon be satisﬁed approximately. Once ξ
ﬂuctuates around the value ξm, these tops become unstable and start to turn over.
On the other hand, in the case of the tippe tops which do not turn over, ξ remains
positive around ξ0 or changes from positive ξ0 to negative values and then back to
positive values close to ξ0 again.

ξm/ξ0| ≈

Under the GBC the governing equations for the tippe top are much simpliﬁed

and, together with the geometry of the tippe top, we obtain a ﬁrst-order ODE for θ
in the following form [10] (see (3.5) or (3.7)) :

(5.1)

(5.2)

It is noted that this equation has a remarkable resemblance to the renormalization
group (RG) equation for the eﬀective coupling constant g,

which appears in quantum ﬁeld theories for critical phenomena [16, 17] and high

energy physics [18]. Here in (5.2), t is expressed as t = lnλ with a dimensionless
scale parameter λ. Provided that β(g) has a zero at g = gc, we ﬁnd that, if β′(gc) < 0,
then g(t)

), and while if β′(gc) > 0, g(t)

→ −∞
(λ
0). The limiting value gc of g(t) is known as the ultraviolet (infrared) ﬁxed
point in the former (latter) case. Similarity between the two equations, (5.1) and

are classiﬁed into three groups, depending on the values of A
R. A resemblance
of Eq.(4.2) to the RG equation also gave us a hint that Eq.(4.2) might serve as a

C and a

criterion for stability of the steady state in Sec. 4.

The criterion (4.2) is a ﬁrst-order ODE for the (perturbed) inclination angle

δθ, and the results derived from this criterion coincide with those by ES and BMR
which are obtained by mathematically rigorous methods. The key ingredients in

the process of arriving at this ﬁrst-order ODE are the order estimation in µ near
the steady states and an intuitive analysis of the equations of motion. The criterion
(4.2) can also be applied to the stability analysis of other spinning objects. In fact

we have applied (4.2) to the spinning motion of spheroids (prolate and oblate) which
was recently examined in detail by MSB [12], and we have obtained consistent results

with theirs.

Finally we have assumed, in the present work, a modiﬁed version of Coulomb

law (2.14) for the sliding friction, since Coulomb friction (2.13) is non-analytic and
undeﬁned at vP = 0. On the other hand, Cohen used Coulomb friction in his
pioneering work on the tippe top [4], and analyzed its spinning motion numerically
for the ﬁrst time. He reported the result of a sample simulation in Fig.5 of his
is away from zero,
paper [4]. The Coulomb friction is realistic provided that

vP

but its application to the spinning motion of the tippe top is very delicate. Near
steady states (i.e., near θ = 0 or π or θs), vP almost vanishes (see, for example, Fig.5
(a) and (b)). And there the X- and Y -components of vP /
are changing signs
rapidly and moreover non-analytically, and so are the components of friction, FX
and FY . Coulomb friction may not be adequate to be applied to such a situation.
In fact, Kane and Levinson [14] argued against the work of Cohen, because it did
not include adequate provisions for transitions from sliding to rolling and vice versa.

They reanalyzed the simulation of Cohen, assuming Coulomb law for sliding friction,

but also providing an algorithm that rolling begins when

is satisﬁed, together with another algorithm for the transition from rolling to sliding.
They found that a transition from sliding to rolling occurs soon after the motion

has begun and that values of θ remain below 0.077 rad thereafter. Or [5] adopted
a hybrid friction law adding viscous friction, which is linearly related to vP , to

38

Coulomb friction. Other frictional forces such as the one which is due to pure
rotation about the normal at the point of contact might have some eﬀect. After all

it is safe to say that we have understood general features of the tippe top inversion.
But it would be not until we have had thorough knowledge of frictional force that

we completely understood the inversion phenomena of the tippe top. And yet, it
ﬂips over.

There exists an intermediate steady state for the tippe top of Group II with property
rc < A
R, when an initial spin n(θ = 0) satisﬁes n1 < n(θ = 0) < n4. There is
also an intermediate steady state for the tippe top of Group III if n(θ = 0) > n1. In
this appendix we show that these steady states are stable.

order in µ. Diﬀerentiating both sides of (4.10) with respect to t, we obtain

C Equivalence between the criterion of ES [7] and

Eq.(4.2)

Ebenfeld and Scheck [7] analyzed the stability of the spinning tippe top using the
total energy as a Liapunov function and gave the stability criteria for the steady

states. We take a diﬀerent approach to this stability problem. First the system is
perturbed around the steady state. Then, using the equations of motion and under
the linear approximation, we obtain a ﬁrst-order ODE for δθ of the form given in

(4.2). We make use of this equation and give a diﬀerent stability criterion. In this
appendix we show that both approaches are equivalent and thus they lead to the

same conclusions on the stability conditions of the steady states.

ES wrote the total energy of the spinning top as the sum of two terms (ES-(33))5

E = E(1)(η3, Lk) + E(2)(ˆη, L⊥, ˙s1,2) ,

(C.1)

the second of which contains all the terms that will vanish at the steady states, while
the ﬁrst depends on η3 ≡

Note that ES set R = 1. The condition dE(1)(θ)/dθ = 0 together with uOX = uOY =

(4.5), (ii) vertical spin state at θ = π (4.6), and (iii) intermediate states (4.28), or
equivalently, (4.7a-4.7b). It is recalled that we have obtained these solutions starting
5From now on, we write the equation (⋆⋆) of Ref.[7] as ES-(⋆⋆). The Jellett constant λ deﬁned

Now we show that the criterion, Eq.(4.2), for the stability of the steady states

is equivalent to the one derived by ES [7]. For the stability analysis of the steady
states, the order estimation in µ near the steady states is important, which has been

pointed out by MSB in their work on the linear stability analysis of the spinning
motion of spheroids [12]. As explained at the beginning of Sec. 4.2, near the steady
states we have d

Actually we have already obtained the expressions (4.13) and (4.22) for vrotP Y (

diate steady states, δn and δΩ are expressed in terms of δθ as (B.10a) and (B.10b),
respectively, and thus we obtain (C.7). Now using Eqs.(C.5)-(C.7) we ﬁnd

Hence we conclude that the following assertions are equivalent: a steady state is
stable (unstable)
θ=θs is positive (negative).
In fact, ES showed that if the quantity (ES-(39)) with the upper sign is positive,
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
then d2E(1)
θ=θs is positive at θs = 0 and the non-inverted rotating motion is Liapunov
dθ2
stable. On the other hand, starting from the equations of motion we derived H and
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
obtained the condition (4.16) for the stability of the rotating motion at θs = 0. It
is easily seen that the statement that the quantity (ES-(39)) with the upper sign is
positive is equivalent to the inequality given in (4.16), once we know that Jellett’s
a). Similarly, if the quantity
constant at θs = 0 is given by J = Cn(θs = 0)(R
−
(ES-(39)) with the lower sign is positive, then d2E(1)
θ=θs is positive at θs = π and
dθ2
the completely inverted rotating motion is Liapunov stable. The condition that the

quantity (ES-(39)) with the lower sign is positive is equivalent to the inequality
given in (4.24). Note, this time, J = Cn(θs = π)(

a).

R

As for the intermediate steady state (

1 < cos θs < 1), ES stated that if the steady
state exists and the quantity (ES-(40)) is negative, then d2E(1)
θ=θs is positive and
dθ2
the state is Liapunov stable. In Sec.4.2.3 we have shown that the stability of the
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
intermediate steady state is determined by the sign of D(xs) given in (4.40). Now
it is interesting to note that D(xs) is related to (ES-(40)) as follows:

(C.10)

Hence the condition that the quantity (ES-(40)) is negative is equivalent to D(xs) >
0. We have seen in Sec.4.2.3 that there exists an intermediate steady state for the
tippe top of Group II and also of Group III. (We have not considered a possible

intermediate steady state for Group I, since such a state, even if it exists, cannot
be reached from the initial spinning position near θ = 0.) For these steady states,
we have shown, in Appendix B, that D(xs) is positive and, therefore, the states are
stable.

D Modiﬁed Maxwell-Bloch equations and stabil-

ity criteria [9]

Recently Bou-Rabee, Marsden and Romero [BMR] treated tippe top inversion as
a dissipation-induced instability. They showed that the modiﬁed Maxwell-Bloch

(mMB) equations are a normal form for tippe top inversion and, using the mMB
equations and an energy-momentum argument, they gave criteria for the stability
on the non-inverted and inverted states of the tippe top [9]. Although we have

not explored the connections between the mMB equations and the ﬁrst-order ODE
(4.2) for δθ, we show in Appendix D that our results on the stability of the vertical

spin states are consistent with the criteria provided by BMR. Actually, rewritten in
terms of dimensional parameters and classiﬁcation criteria used in this paper, the

expressions of those criteria become more transparent and they lead to the same
stability conditions as ours for the vertical spinning states. Besides, although BMR

did not mentioned, the classiﬁcation of tippe tops into three groups, Group I, II,
and III, according to the behaviors of spinning motion, is possible from the close
examination of those criteria.

BMR used the moments of inertia deﬁned as the ones about the principal axes
attached to the center of sphere instead of the center of mass. The correspondence

between the parameters used by BMR and ones in this paper are as follows:

where ΩBMR is the spin rate of the initially standing equilibrium solution (we added
a subscript BMR to distinguish from our Ω), and the dimensionless BMR’s “Jellett”

expressed the vector from the center of sphere to the center of mass −→SO (in the
BMR notation −→OC) as −→SO = Re⋆k, where k is a unit vector along the symmetry
axis. Using the tippe top modiﬁed Maxwell-Bloch equations, BMR obtained the

stability criteria for the non-inverted state which are given by the three inequalities

They took k = eZ (upward) in (BMR-(5.3)). Since the non-inverted state has

ΩBMR = n(θ = 0). The ﬁrst inequality of (BMR-(5.3)) is rewritten as A
C > 0, which
is always satisﬁed. Apart from some irrelevant positive constants, the second and
third inequalities are expressed, respectively, as

Thus, the BMR criteria (BMR-(5.3)) lead to the same result as ours on the stability
of the vertical spin state at θ = 0.

The inequalities (BMR-(5.3)), which were derived as the stability criteria for the
non-inverted state, can also be used for the stability criteria for the inverted state,
but with some replacements. Since k = eZ (upward), the inverted state has the center
of mass above the center of sphere. Thus we have e⋆ = a
n(θ = π).
6From now on, we write the equation (⋆⋆) of Ref.[9] as BMR-(⋆⋆).

Thus, the BMR criteria (BMR-(5.3)) also lead to the same result as ours on the
stability of the vertical spin state at θ = π.

Actually, BMR derived also the stability criteria for the inverted state, taking
eZ, which are given by the three inequalities in (BMR-(5.4))7. Of course,
k =
we can use them to obtain the stability conditions for the inverted state. Taking

In terms of the classiﬁcation criteria
Theorem 6.2 and the appendix of Ref. [9].

and conditions obtained in this paper, the statement in BMR on the existence of a
heteroclinic connection can be restated as follows: (i) A tippe top must belong to

Group II in order to have a heteroclinic connection. (ii) Further more, the initial
spin n(θ = 0) should be larger than n1 (Eq.(4.18)) and n4 (Eq.(4.42)) so that a tippe
top becomes unstable at θ = 0 and reaches the inverted position. The requirements
n(θ = 0) > n1 and n(θ = 0) > n4, respectively, correspond to the criteria r0 > 0 and
r4 > 0 in Theorem 6.2 in BMR.

Numerical solutions for Sommerfeld model in nonrelativistic case are pre-
sented for the scattering of a spinless extended charged body in the static Coulomb
ﬁeld of a ﬁxed point charge. It is shown that diﬀerential cross section for ex-
tended body preserves the form of the Rutherford result with multiplier, not equal
to one (as in classical case), but inversely proportional to the value of the size
of the body, i.e. the greater is the value of body’s size, the smaller is the value
of cross section.
03.50.De

Here we continue [1] our numerical investigation of Sommerfeld model in
classical electrodynamics. It is convenient to remind that Sommerfeld model
of charged rigid sphere [2] is the simplest model to take into consideration the
inﬂuence of self-electromagnetic ﬁeld of a radiating extended charged body on
its equation of motion (in the limit of zero body’s size we get the known Lorentz-
Dirac equation with all connected with it problems: renormalization of mass,
preacceleration, run-away solutions, etc.).

In the previous article the eﬀect of classical tunneling was considered - due
to retardation moving body recognize the existence of potential barrier too late,
when this barrier is overcomed ([1], see also [3]).

Physical considerations bring us to another conclusion. Due to retardation
Rutherford scattering of a charged extended body in the static Coulomb ﬁeld of
a ﬁxed point charge must diﬀer from classical scattering of point-like particle.
That is the scattering angle for the same value of impact parameter for extended
particle must be smaller then that for the point-like particle without radiation
(for Lorentz-Dirac equation Rutherford scattering was numerically investigated
in [4]).

For the case of simplicity here we consider the nonrelativistic, linear in ve-

locity, version of Sommerfeld model.

Let the total charge of a uniformly charged sphere be Q, mechanical mass -

m, radius - a. Then its equation of motion reads:

m ˙~v = ~Fext + η [~v(t − 2a/c) − ~v(t)]

here η = Q

The starting conditions at x = 0 are:

Xi = 1000, Yi = b (−impact parameter)

˙Xi = vi,

˙Yi = 0.

We take vi to be 0.1, K = 0.4/3.0 and λ = 0.1 (i.e. e = Q and L = 5rcl ).

A.
Numerical results are expressed on ﬁgs. 1,2.
On ﬁg. 1. one can see how the scattering angle varies from point-like particle
(classical scattering, curve 1) to extended body (curve 2). Here b = 60.0, δ =
4.0, vertical axis is Y , horizontal - X. So due to retardation the scattering angle
θ for extended body is smaller than that for point-like particle.

Diﬀerential cross section dσ is given by the formula

dσ = 2πρ(θ)|

Thus diﬀerential cross section for extended body preserves the form of the
Rutherford result with multiplier, not equal to one (as in classical case), but
inversely proportional to the value of the size of the body, i.e. the greater is the
value of body’s size, the smaller is the value of cross section dσ.

On ﬁg. 2 we see how the direct proportionality between b2 · (vi)4 · (λ)−2
and ξ changes in accordance to formula (7). Vertical axis is b2 · (vi)4 · (λ)−2
and horizontal - ξ. Values of retardation δ (or dimensionless body’s size) are
taken to be δ = 0 (Rutherf ord scattering), 1, 2, 3, 4, and curves are marked
accordingly as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (for taken starting conditions the classical result is
reproduced by numerical calculations with accuracy < 3%).

(Dated: February 20, 2014)

The popular demonstration involving a permanent magnet falling through a metallic pipe is
treated as an azimuthally symmetric boundary value problem. Speciﬁcally, Maxwell’s equations
are solved for a uniformly magnetized, cylindrical bar magnet moving coaxially inside an inﬁnitely
long, conducting cylindrical shell of ﬁnite thickness at nonrelativistic speeds. Analytic solutions
for the ﬁelds are developed and used to derive the resulting drag force acting on the magnet in
integral form. This treatment provides a signiﬁcant improvement over the existing ones, and can
be made the basis of a quantitative laboratory experiment. A detailed analytical and numerical
study of the properties of the drag force is presented. While the analysis is rigorous and the
results are new, the presentation is primarily pedagogical and emphasizes clarity, completeness,
and accessability. Accordingly, extended discussions of approximations, estimation of neglected
contributions, electrodynamics of moving magnets, material properties of the pipe, eﬀect of the
shape and speed of the magnet, and the role of energy conservation are presented.

INTRODUCTION

A. Background and Signiﬁcance

A popular physics demonstration involves a permanent magnet falling through a metallic pipe1,2,3,4. This arrange-
ment has long been a favorite for demonstrating such topics as Faraday’s law of induction, Lenz’s law, eddy currents,
inductive heating and magnetic damping. The underlying physical process is induction heating: the moving magnet
creates a changing magnetic ﬂux in its vicinity which induces circulating eddy currents within the pipe wall, thereby
causing ohmic dissipation and generating a drag force on the magnet by energy conservation. The force itself is of
course manifested as the action of the magnetic ﬁeld generated by the eddies on the permanent magnet, with its
retarding nature understood as a manifestation of Lenz’s law. A particularly vivid picture of this mechanism emerges
if one views the magnet as an assembly of circulating atomic currents moving through the pipe. Lenz’s law then
implies that the induced eddies in the pipe wall counter-circulate ahead of the moving magnet and co-circulate behind
it. But this implies that the moving magnet is repelled in front and attracted in rear, hence acted upon by a retarding
force.

An early contribution to the literature on this demonstration is Clack and Toepker,1 who presented a description
of the experiment and provided some measured results. Subsequently, Saslow2 treated the problem of eddy currents
in thin conducting sheets quite generally, and as an example provided an approximate calculation of the drag force
on a magnet falling inside a conducting pipe. MacLatchy et al.3 used other methods to derive Saslow’s result for
the terminal speed and pointed out a sizable discrepancy between the predictions of this result and their measured
values. These authors also developed a numerical simulation of the magnetic ﬁeld inside the pipe that improved the
agreement considerably. Hahn et al.4 considered a magnet undergoing an oscillatory motion inside the pipe, treating
the damping force `a la Saslow and MacLatchy augmented by some corrections for the ﬁnite length and thickness of
the pipe (see the discussion below), and presented a comparison of their measured and predicted results. It is worth
mentioning here that there is also a lively literature on the subject of magnetic braking in general that has a bearing
on the present discussion5.

Following Saslow’s calculation,2 analytical treatments of the magnet-pipe problem have considered the magnet as a
point dipole moving at low speeds and the pipe as inﬁnitely thin-walled and long. These assumptions imply that the
only signiﬁcant length parameter in the problem is the interior diameter of the pipe, and lead to a simple expression for
the drag force. We will refer to this limit as the idealized model and derive it as a limiting case of our general solution
in Sec. V B 2. The point-dipole assumption corresponds to a magnet whose dimensions are negligible compared to
the pipe diameter while being of suﬃcient strength. This assumption is not really justiﬁed for typical magnet-pipe
parameters as MacLatchy et al.3 pointed out and as the results of our analysis in Sec. V A will demonstrate. The
thin-wall assumption, on the other hand, requires the pipe thickness to be negligible compared to the radius of the
pipe. In the experiments of MacLatchy et al. the pipe thickness was about 9% of its radius, not entirely negligible if
quantitative agreement with observed data at a few percent level or better is desired. The restriction to small speeds,
on the other hand, is moderately well satisﬁed for the typical arrangement where the magnet starts to fall through
the pipe with zero initial velocity2, as our discussion in Sec. V A 2 will conﬁrm. On the other hand, the long-pipe

2

assumption is well satisﬁed as long as the magnet is not close to the ends of the pipe.

In summary, the idealized model fails to give a satisfactory quantitative agreement with experiment for a typical
arrangement.3,4 The primary sources of inaccuracy in the model are the point-dipole and thin-wall assumptions,
with the low-speed approximation a potential source of inaccuracy as well. These assertions will be quantitatively
conﬁrmed in Section V where we consider various approximations and limiting cases and compare them to the exact
solution developed here.

B. Objectives and Limitations

≪

Our objective in this work is to develop a formulation of the magnet-pipe system that is suﬃciently realistic to yield
an accurate prediction of the drag force at a few percent level or better. Speciﬁcally we will avoid the point-dipole
and thin-wall assumptions of the idealized model, and instead treat the case of a uniformly magnetized, azimuthally
symmetric, bar magnet moving coaxially inside an inﬁnitely long, conducting cylindrical shell of arbitrary thickness.
Since any practical realization of this model will likely involve magnet speeds far smaller than the speed of light,
1, where v is the magnet speed and c is the speed of
we will restrict our treatment to nonrelativistic speeds, v/c
light. On the other hand, we are including the possibility of the magnet being projected into the pipe thus allowing
much higher speeds than can be attained by a magnet that starts to fall from rest under gravity. The restriction to
nonrelativistic speeds implies that we are dealing with quasi-static sources and ﬁelds where displacement currents can
be neglected.6 This is so not only in the interior of the pipe where the inclusion of the displacement currents would
amount to a minute correction of the order of (v/c)2 but also within the pipe wall where conduction currents dominate
displacement currents. To provide a basis for the latter assertion, we note that the basic time scale generated by the
motion of the magnet is of the order of R1/v, where R1 is the inner radius of the pipe. This time scale corresponds to
a frequency of the order of v/R1, which implies that the ratio of displacement to conduction currents is of the order
of ǫ0v/σR1 where σ is the conductivity of the pipe wall7. For common metals and with 1
10 cm, this ratio is
in the 3(10−7
1 by assumption, the ratio in question is seen to be vanishingly small.
The assumption of an inﬁnitely long pipe is unavoidable if a manageable solution is desired. The error resulting
from this assumption, on the other hand, is small if the magnet is not close to the pipe ends. To provide a basis for
this assertion, one can use the idealized solution, Sec. V B 2, to estimate the dissipated power within the pipe segment
that extends from its actual end to its idealized end (which is inﬁnitely far). The ratio of this quantity to the total
dissipated power is then an estimate of the leading ﬁnite-length correction to the drag force. This ratio is found to
be of the order of (R1/D)7, where D is the distance from the magnet to the near end of the pipe and R1 is the pipe’s
interior diameter. For R1/D . 1/4, for example, the expected correction would be of order 10−4 which is quite small
as claimed.

Another approximation discussed above, namely the neglect of displacement currents, implies that the radiated
power from the magnet-pipe assembly is negligible. Inasmuch as the motion of the magnet is accelerated before it
reaches terminal speed, one would expect the magnet-pipe system to emit some electromagnetic radiation. To get an
idea of the magnitude of such radiation, in Sec. II C we consider a permanent magnet possessing a magnetic dipole
moment m moving longitudinally (i.e., parallel to m) through free space at nonrelativistic speeds. The radiated
power from such a source, given in Eq. (13), is found to be µ0m2¨v2/30πc5 where ˙v and ¨v are the ﬁrst and second time
derivatives of the magnet’s speed. This quantity should be compared to the ohmic dissipation in the pipe wall which
for this purpose may be estimated using the idealized model. Using the solution to the idealized model given in Sec.
4 where s is the thickness of the pipe wall.
V B 2, we estimate the ohmic dissipation rate to be 45µ2
For reasonable values of the parameters, the radiated power is totally dominated by the ohmic dissipation rate hence
conﬁrming the expectation that radiation is completely negligible in this problem.

This completes the discussion of the validity of various assumptions made in our formulation. While the analysis
presented in this paper is rigorous and the results are new, the presentation is primarily pedagogical and emphasizes
clarity, completeness, and accessability. Accordingly such topics as the limits of validity of the existing results, the
importance of neglected contributions, transformation properties of the magnet source currents, radiation emitted by
a moving magnet, the role of energy conservation, and the eﬀect on the drag force of the magnet shape and speed as
well as the pipe conductivity and susceptibility are analyzed and discussed. These discussions extend beyond what is
needed for a quantitative description of the magnet-pipe experiment. As we hope to demonstrate in this paper, the
magnet-pipe system is a rich landscape of concepts and methods in electromagnetic theory, a fact that allows us to
deal with several important physical phenomena in a concrete manner. Throughout we have strived to illustrate the
importance of interweaving physical reasoning with mathematical techniques in analyzing physical problems.

The analytical and numerical results reported here, supplemented with a computer program posted on the web,8
can be made the basis of a quantitative laboratory experiment involving various aspects of the magnet-pipe system.
Furthermore, certain aspects of the analysis or extensions thereof such as the asymptotic limits presented in Sec. V B

3

as well as others not treated here can be utilized as challenging assignments in mathematical methods.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sec. II A deals with the characterization of the source currents of a
permanent cylindrical magnet in axial motion at arbitrary speed, and II B with the vector potential of such a magnet
in the quasi-static limit. The electromagnetic ﬁelds of the magnet-pipe system are found in Sec. III and the magnetic
drag force is calculated in Sec. IV. Sec. V A presents the results of numerical computations for the drag force as well
as a detailed discussion of its dependence on magnet shape and speed, and also on the material properties of the pipe.
Several limiting cases of this dependence are explicitly veriﬁed in V B in the form of asymptotic formulas. Concluding
remarks are presented in Sec. VI.

II.

SOURCES AND FIELDS OF A MAGNET MOVING IN FREE SPACE

The ﬁrst step in our analysis is the calculation of the electromagnetic ﬁelds of a permanent cylindrical magnet
moving along its axis of symmetry in free space. We need these ﬁelds as input for the magnet-pipe conﬁguration
as well as for calculating the radiated power from a moving magnet, both for nonrelativistic motion. However,
we begin our formulation under the more general conditions of arbitrary speed and acceleration, then specialize to
nonrelativistic motion in order to derive the speciﬁc results needed for the magnet-pipe problem.

A. Source currents of a moving magnet

By a permanent (or hard ) magnet is meant a ferromagnetic material whose magnetization does not change when
immersed in external ﬁelds, electromagnetic or gravitational.
In practice, this requirement is met for moderate
electromagnetic or gravitational ﬁelds. Since the physical eﬀects of acceleration are locally indistinguishable from
those of gravity according to the equivalence principle,9 we conclude that a permanent magnet is unaﬀected by
(moderate) acceleration. This conclusion allows us to characterize the accelerating magnet by means of equivalent

in the rest frame of the magnet. Observe that this current distribution is exactly that of an ideally wound solenoid
of radius a and length L with a current per unit length of m/(πa2L), as expected. This quantity must now be
transformed to the laboratory frame.

At this juncture we recall that the charge and current density together transform as a 4-vector under a Lorenz
transformation.11 Here the charge density of the magnet vanishes in its rest frame, and since the current density
vector is transverse with respect to the direction of relative motion, the charge density in the laboratory frame must
vanish as well. As a result the transformation equations reduce to the simple result that JM (ρ, z, φ, t) = J′
M (ρ′, φ′, z′).
Note the emergence of the time dependence in JM (ρ, φ, z, t), which originates in the fact that z′ depends on time as
well as on z, as seen below.

The coordinates transform in the standard way: ρ = ρ′, φ = φ′, and z′ = γ[z

zM (t)], where γ=[1

and v = ˙zM (t). Note that we have suppressed the time dependence of v for brevity. Using the above relations, we

where Llab = L/γ and mlab = m/γ. Here the superscript “lab” refers to quantities as measured in the laboratory
frame. Compared to the corresponding form in the rest frame, Eq. (2), this result indicates that the moving magnet
undergoes length contraction as well as a contraction of magnetic dipole moment. The latter of course reﬂects time
dilation, which causes a contraction of all currents in the magnet. The two eﬀects leave the “current per unit length”
of the equivalent solenoid invariant. For a suﬃciently long magnet, this implies that the resultant magnetic ﬁeld
in the interior of the magnet is equal to ˆzµ0m/(πa2L) in either reference frame12. This is of course the familiar
result that a magnetic ﬁeld component parallel to the relative velocity does not change under Lorenz transformation.
Similarly, one can readily show that the contraction of magnetic dipole moment found above is consistent with the
known transformation properties of polarization and magnetization vectors.11

B. Vector Potential of the Moving Magnet

Our task here is the calculation of the vector potential corresponding to the current density distribution of the
moving magnet given in Eq. (4) in the quasi-static limit where displacement currents are neglected. Since in the case
of the moving magnet the current density is transverse (or divergenceless) and the charge density vanishes, the Lorenz
AM = 0, where AM is the vector
and Coulomb gauges are equivalent, with the common gauge condition given by
potential of the moving magnet. The electromagnetic ﬁelds of the magnet are of course obtained from the general
relations B =
∂A/∂t. The azimuthal symmetry of the current density, on the other hand, allows
one to write AM (ρ, φ, z, t) = AM (ρ, z, t) ˆφ. Thus the vector potential has an azimuthal ( ˆφ) component only which
does not depend on the azimuthal coordinate φ, just like the current density vector. This implies that (a) the electric
ﬁeld is also purely azimuthal, and (b) the magnetic ﬁeld has a radial ( ˆρ) as well as a longitudinal (ˆz) component. It
is of course the former component that exerts the retarding force on the moving magnet.
Using the standard solution for the vector potential in the quasi-static limit, we ﬁnd

magnet.

ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS OF THE MAGNET-PIPE SYSTEM

Having developed the near and far ﬁelds of the moving magnet in free space, we now turn to ﬁnding the ﬁelds of
the magnet-pipe system. We do this by developing the general solution ﬁrst, followed by the imposition of continuity
conditions.

Using the analogy of waves, one may interpret the terms appearing in Eqs. (18-20) as “reﬂections”and “transmis-
sions” resulting from the “incident” term ˜Aqs
M (ρ, k). This source term representing the contribution of the moving
magnet is incident upon the inner surface of the pipe. The second term in region (i) is the reﬂection from the inner
surface of the pipe into the interior. The two terms in region (ii) correspond to a linear combination of the transmit-
ted term from region (i) and the reﬂected term from the outer surface of the pipe. In region (iii) we only have the
transmitted term from region (ii), since there will be no reﬂection from “the surface at inﬁnity.” From a mathematical
point of view, on the other hand, one starts with a linear combination of the solutions of Eq. (17) in each region
and proceeds to impose the required boundary conditions. Thus in region (i), the singular term [K1(

Our next task is the formulation of continuity conditions across the two boundary surfaces, the inner and outer
surfaces of the pipe wall. We recall from above that the electric ﬁeld is purely azimuthal while the magnetic ﬁeld has
a radial as well as a longitudinal component. We will denote these Eφ (= ˆφ
B),
respectively. Now the boundary conditions require the continuity of Eφ (Faraday’s law), Bρ (absence of magnetic
monopoles), and Hz (the Amp`ere-Maxwell law and absence of surface currents) across the two boundary surfaces,
where H = B/µ0 in regions (i) and (iii), and H = B/µ in region (ii). When expressed in terms of A, the ﬁrst two
of these conditions require the continuity of A while the third condition requires the continuity of µ−1∂(ρA)/∂ρ. An
inspection of Eq. (16) shows that these conditions must also be obeyed by ˜A. This gives us the continuity equations
µ0
that must be imposed on the solutions of Eq. (17). Recall that we must also apply the conditions κ
in regions (i) and (iii).

where JM (r, t) is the eﬀective current density of the magnet given in Eq. (3) in the nonrelativistic limit γ = 1. Note
that B(r) can be replaced with Bext(r) in Eq. (26), where the latter is the magnetic ﬁeld produced in region (i) by
sources external to the magnet. Using Eqs. (15) and (18), we ﬁnd

This equation gives the drag force acting on the moving magnet and is a central result of our analysis.

It is instructive to rederive this result from the energy conservation principle. Let us consider the magnet-pipe
system at a moment the magnet is moving through the pipe with velocity v. Under the quasi-static conditions
stipulated in the Sec.
I B, ohmic power dissipation in the pipe wall must be balanced by a matching decrease in
the kinetic energy of the moving magnet, since the power ﬂow into the electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration, including
radiation, is negligible. But the decrease in kinetic energy corresponds to a resistive force according to the work-
v, where Pohm is the rate of ohmic dissipation (or Joule heating). Needless to say, the
energy theorem, Pohm =
magnet may be experiencing non-electromagnetic forces such as gravity or air drag which would have their own power
contributions. Now Poynting’s theorem assures us that the dissipated power equals the ﬂux of Poynting’s vector into
the pipe wall through its inner surface. Putting these two observations together, we arrive at

V. PROPERTIES OF THE DRAG FORCE

9

This section is devoted to a detailed discussion of the properties of the drag force derived above. We shall begin
by characterizing the main features of the drag force in Sec. V A, including its dependence on the shape and speed
of the magnet as well as the material properties of the pipe wall. We will then outline the derivation of asymptotic
expressions for a number of useful limiting cases in Sec. V B.

A. Main Features

1. Dependence on Magnet Shape

Let us start by examining the dependence of the drag force on the dimensions of the magnet. We have already
arranged Eq. (29) in such a way as to isolate and highlight the dependence of the drag force on the relevant parameters.
The force is opposite the velocity19 and it is scaled by the square of the magnet’s dipole moment.20 For a ﬁxed value
of the dipole moment, the dependence of the force on the dimensions of the magnet is entirely contained in the two
bracketed factors in Eq. (29), the ﬁrst of which depends on the magnet length L and the second on its radius a. Each
of these factors has been normalized to unity at the point-dipole limit, the ﬁrst at L = 0 and the second at a = 0.
An inspection of the second factor shows that it increases monotonically with increasing a, which is expected as such
an increase brings the source currents in the magnet closer to the eddy currents in the pipe wall thus increasing the
interaction force. On the other hand, the envelope of the ﬁrst factor clearly decreases with increasing magnet length,
suggesting a corresponding decrease in the drag force with increasing magnet length. This is in fact conﬁrmed by our
numerical results, and reﬂects the weakening of the external magnetic ﬁeld with increasing magnet length (with a
, just as it would for an ideal
ﬁxed magnetic dipole moment as stipulated), which ﬁeld eventually vanishes as L/a
solenoid. It must be remembered, however, that a can at most equal R1, and L must remain small compared to the
distance from the magnet to the pipe ends. It is convenient in this regard to deﬁne an ordered pair of dimensionless
parameters, (L/2a, a/R1), characterizing the inverse aspect ratio of the magnet and the tightness of its ﬁt inside the
pipe, respectively. Thus for a given dipole strength, the pair (0, 1.00) corresponds to a wafer-shaped magnet that
would just ﬁt inside the pipe while (1, 0.60) describes a “square cylinder” ﬁlling 36% of the interior cross section of
the pipe.

The ﬁve cases shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate the eﬀect of the shape of the magnet on the drag force. A comparison of
cases (a) and (b) in Fig. 1 clearly shows that for ﬁxed values of the dipole moment and speed the drag force increases
as the magnet is shortened. Comparing cases (b) and (d), or (c) and (e), on the other hand, we see an increase in the
drag force with increasing magnet diameter. These ﬁve cases clearly demonstrate the strong inﬂuence of the shape of
the magnet on the drag force. In particular, they clearly demonstrate the quantitative inadequacy of the point-dipole
approximation, case (c), across a broad range of speeds, as discussed in Sec. I A.

deviation of about 10% in the low-speed regime. This deviation should be compared with the ratio (R2 −
characterizing the relative thickness of the pipe, which equals 0.100 for all cases in Fig. 1. It is clear that the error
caused by the thin-wall assumption is in general unacceptably large for a reasonable agreement with measurement
results under typical conditions. Exceptions can of course occur: for case (d) corresponding to a short cylindrical
magnet ﬁtting snugly inside the pipe, the errors caused by the point-dipole and thin-wall approximations nearly cancel
one another in the low-speed regime.

It is appropriate at this juncture to compare the prediction of our analysis to the measured results of MacLatchy

et al.3. Using the parameter values reported by these authors, namely m = 0.67 A m2, σ = 5.08

that in this comparison we are neglecting the air drag force on the magnet, estimated by MacLatchy et al. to be less
than 0.1% of the magnetic drag force hence deemed negligible. The quoted error of 0.5 cm s−1 in our calculated result
is estimated on the basis of the (implied) precision level of the measured values given by MacLatchy et al. for L, a,
R1, and the magnet weight. Keeping in mind that other sources of error such as the actual magnetization
m, R2 −
distribution of the magnet and the tendency of the magnet to wobble as it falls through the pipe are disregarded in
the above error estimates, we conclude that our predicted value of the magnet speed agrees with the measured value
within the error limits.

→

The circular wafer (L = 0) geometry merits special attention since in that case the drag force grows without limit as
a
R1. In other words, the shape characterized by (0, 1) is a singular limit where the magnetic drag force diverges.
This behavior may be understood as follows. In the limit of (0, 1) geometry, the eﬀective (or “bound”) source currents
of the magnet are concentrated in a single current ring of radius R1. However, such a source would induce similarly
concentrated eddy current rings in the pipe wall on its interior surface, i.e., at zero distance from the source itself
thus causing inﬁnite interaction forces due to overlapping current rings. This situation is analogous to the divergence
of the image force on a point charge as it approaches the surface of a conductor. It is worth remarking that while
the limit itself is unphysical, the sharp increase in the magnetic drag force for L
R1 is very real and
already discernible from a comparison of cases (c) and (e) in Fig. 1. In practice, this sharp increase in the magnetic
drag would be accompanied by a parallel increase in the air drag force caused by the unavoidable constriction in the
ﬂow of air around the magnet.22

The eﬀect just discussed can also be understood by reference to Eq. 29. Using the asymptotic properties of the
modiﬁed Bessel functions,18 we ﬁnd that Im[Q(k)]
R1, the

shape factors in Eq. (29) behave like exp(2kR1)/k3 as k
. Putting these two statements together, we conclude

that the integrand in Eq. (29) behaves like k−1 for large k, which implies a logarithmic divergence at the upper limit
of the integral. Recalling that k is the Fourier conjugate of z [cf. Eq. (29)], so that large values of k are associated
with short values of z, we conclude that this divergence is a short-distance eﬀect. This is of course the conclusion we
reached above on physical grounds.

2. Dependence on Magnet Speed

11

The dependence of the drag force on the speed of the magnet is contained in Q(k) through the combination µσv
and is more involved than the dependence on its shape. It proves expedient to discuss this dependence in terms of a
length parameter deﬁned by l0 = (µ0σv)−1. As discussed below, l0 represents the penetration depth of the ﬁelds into
the pipe wall under appropriate conditions. The two distinguished ranges of v, which we will refer to as “low” and
R1, respectively.24 We will ﬁrst consider the low-speed regime, as it
“high” speed,23 correspond to l0 ≫
is the relevant one in practice. In this speed range, we have α
rell0),
rell0k), so that αkR1 ≃
and similarly for αkR2. Thus the imaginary part of the argument of various modiﬁed Bessel functions is much smaller
than the corresponding real part. This would in turn imply that, to the leading order, the imaginary part of those
functions is linear in R1/l0 and R2/l0. This fact implies the same for Q, to wit, that in the low-speed regime the
imaginary part of Q is linear in R1/l0 (and R2/l0), hence proportional to σv.25 This conﬁrms the expectation that in
R1, the braking force is a linear drag proportional to the conductivity of the pipe
the low-speed regime where l0 ≫

The linear nature of the drag force in the low-speed regime is in evidence for all cases in Fig. 1.

In typical
demonstration setups, one would expect terminal speeds of the order of 1 m s−1 or less, which corresponds to the
neighborhood of the origin in Fig. 1 where the drag force is closely proportional to the magnet speed. Indeed from
the the low-speed condition µσvR1 ≪
1 given above, we can estimate the relative deviation from linearity to be of the
order of (µσvR1)2. For case (d) of Fig. 1, this estimate of deviation gives (0.63v[m s−1])2, which amounts to about
2.5% at a terminal speed of 25 m s−1.

R1/l0, R2/l0 ≫
as (R1/l0)
1. Since these functions behave exponentially for large values of their argument,
the said scaling behavior results in an overall suppression Im(Q) in the high speed regime, corresponding to a decrease
in the drag force. In other words, the drag force is a decreasing function of σv in the high-speed regime. Physically,
a pronounced skin eﬀect which suppresses the penetration of the ﬁeld into the pipe wall takes hold at high speeds,
thereby reducing the eddy currents and the drag force resulting from them. Indeed, recalling from Sec. I B that the
dominant time scale in the magnet-pipe system is R1/v, which corresponds to a frequency ω
v/R1, we see that
≈
R1.24 But this last condition states that
the high speed condition l0 ≪
the skin depth corresponding to the dominant time scale is much smaller than R1 and, barring unusually thin-walled
R1 in this limit, which is the
pipes, much smaller than R2 −
condition for a pronounced skin eﬀect.6 It is appropriate to repeat here that the high speed limit is not likely to occur
in typical arrangements of the magnet-pipe demonstration.

The nonlinear behavior of the drag force at intermediate speeds and its eventual drop at high speeds deduced above
are clearly in evidence for all cases displayed in Fig. 1. Note that the high-speed decline in the drag force becomes
sharper as the source currents in the magnet are more highly concentrated. Recalling our discussion of the singular
geometry above, we see the reason for this behavior: as source currents become more concentrated, short-distance,
equivalently high-k, contributions become more important, a feature that runs contrary to the high-speed situation
where high k values are relatively less important.

3. Dependence on Conductivity and Susceptibility

Recall that the drag force dependence on the magnet speed is through the combination µσv. This implies that the
drag force behavior versus σ follows the same pattern as for v. In particular, higher conductivity makes for a larger
drag force at low speeds hence the use of copper tubes for demonstration purposes. At high speeds, however, the
drag force decreases with pipe conductivity, just as it does with magnet speed. An interesting conclusion, therefore,
is that the drag force vanishes for a perfect conductor which, as explained above, is simply a consequence of a strong
skin eﬀect. This behavior is displayed in Fig. 2 which is a plot of the drag force versus σ for case (d) of Sec. V A 1 at
a magnet speed of 0.10 m s−1. It is important to note that the decline of the drag force for high values of σ is not
directly applicable to practical arrangements which usually correspond to the low-speed (or possibly intermediate-
speed) regime . Also to be noted is the fact that the designation “perfect conductor” here implies electric conduction
without resistance, and is to be distinguished from “superconductor” which in addition implies a distinct magnetic
behavior as noted below. Of course inasmuch as a superconductor has zero resistance, the above argument shows that

the magnetic drag force vanishes for a superconducting pipe. Needless to say, this conclusion as well as the one above
for a perfect conductor, directly follow from the energy conservation principle, which in this case asserts that there
can be no drag force without a corresponding dissipation of power in the pipe.

This brings us to the question of how the magnetic properties of the pipe wall aﬀect the drag force. Thus far we
have assumed a linear magnetic material of relative permeability µrel for the pipe wall. Inasmuch as the magnetic
1 for
susceptibility of non-ferromagnetic common metals diﬀers little from that of the vacuum, one can set µrel ≃
practical purposes, as we did for the cases displayed in Fig. 1. However, it is physically interesting and meaning-
, corresponding to perfect diamagnetism and perfect
0 and µrel → ∞
ful to consider the extreme cases of µrel →
paramagnetism, respectively. Perfect diamagnetic behavior is exempliﬁed by a (type I) superconductor which would
exclude any magnetic ﬁeld from its interior (save for a very small penetration depth). This phenomenon, known as
the Meissner eﬀect, is not a mere consequence of perfect conductivity and serves to distinguish a superconductor
from a material that conducts electricity without dissipation.26 Perfect paramagnetism, on the other hand, is approx-
imately realized by “soft” ferromagnetic materials which have a narrow hysteresis loop and can be idealized as highly
susceptible, linear magnetic materials.

An inspection of Eq. (29) shows that relative permeability occurs in the quantities α and β = α/µrel through
the combination µrelµ0σv in α, and in addition, β is inversely proportional to µrel. Leaving the latter aside for the
moment, we conclude that the drag force dependence on µrel is much like its dependence on the magnet speed. Thus
, corresponding to strongly diamagnetic and paramagnetic
the drag force must vanish for both µrel →
limits. As further discussed in Sec. V B 4, the additional dependence of β on µrel does not change these qualitative
features. Thus the drag force corresponding to a superconductor vanishes not only because of its perfect conductivity
but also due to its perfect diamagnetism. Similarly, the drag force is seen to be small for a strongly paramagnetic
conductor, or soft ferromagnetic alloys that behave like one. The asymptotic behavior of the drag force for µrel ≪
1
1 is analyzed in sections V B 4 and V B 5, respectively, where the foregoing conclusions are explicitly
and µrel ≫
conﬁrmed.

0 and µrel → ∞

Figure 3 shows a plot of the drag force versus µrel for case (d) of Sec. V A 1 at a magnet speed of 1.0 m s−1, where

the features deduced above are in evidence.

B. Asymptotic Behavior

In this section we will outline the development of a few limiting expressions for the drag force given in Eq. (29).
The methods used are those of approximation and asymptotic analysis of integrals the details of which would take us
beyond the scope of this paper.27

As a preliminary step we recall that in all cases except for Sec. V B 4 the main contributions to the integral of
1 . This fact makes it convenient to rescale the integration variable therein

asymptotic expressions for the drag force in a number of interesting limiting cases.

1. Low Magnet Speed

The low-speed regime is deﬁned by the condition R1/l0 ≪

1.24 To establish the fact that F is linear in v in the
low-speed limit, as discussed in Sec. V A 2, we note that Q(u, s/R1, 0, µrel) is real at v = 0 (corresponding to the
vanishing of the drag force at zero speed), so that an expansion of Im(Q) about v = 0 using the asymptotic properties
of the modiﬁed Bessel functions18 yields Im[Q(u, s/R1, R1/l0, µrel)] ∼=
equals
Im[∂Q(u, s/R1, 0, µrel)/∂(R1/l0)], and is given by a long expression which need not be reproduced here. Substituting
the approximate form of Im(Q) in Eq. (33), we immediately obtain the linear drag behavior in the low-speed limit:

3. High Magnet Speed

As stated in Sec. V A 2, in the high-speed regime where l0/R1 ≪

1, the quantity α in Eqs. (23-25) has a large
magnitude which forces the respective modiﬁed Bessel functions to their asymptotic range. Since the four quantities

4. Highly Diamagnetic Pipe

This is the limit µrel →

0, which is appropriate to a highly diamagnetic pipe wall material. In this limit the factor
β which occurs in Q grows large and severely suppresses the magnitude of Im(Q) in Eq. (33), and in addition limits
its contributions to very small values of u. This mathematical behavior reﬂects the physical phenomenon of magnetic
ﬂux expulsion that accompanies the approach to perfect diamagnetism.

Since only small values of u are important in Eq. (33), we can replace all modiﬁed Bessel functions by their

asymptotic values in the small argument limit.18 This leads to the following approximate expression for Q:

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper we have explored the physics of magnetic braking in the context of the demonstration involving a
magnet falling inside a conducting pipe. Our primary objectives were (a) to develop a reasonably realistic, quantita-
tively useful, and analytically manageable formulation of the magnet-pipe system, and (b) to discuss as completely
as practicable the physical phenomena relevant to the magnet-pipe system. We believe these objectives have been
realized as evidenced by, e.g., the results presented in Sec. V. We have also considered several extensions of the basic
experiment where conditions well beyond those of a typical demonstration arrangement have been treated.

The present formulation can be readily extended to the case of a permanent magnet possessing a nonuniform,
azimuthally symmetric magnetization with components in the radial and axial directions. Commercially available
magnets are likely to deviate from the uniform, axial magnetization assumed here. If sizable, such a deviation can
become a source of signiﬁcant error. Although a suﬃciently accurate characterization of the magnetization distribution
can be a nontrivial experimental task, it might be unavoidable if a close quantitative agreement with measured results
is desired.

The extension to nonuniform magnetization mentioned above is conceptually straightforward. This is because, with
the magnetization geometry stipulated above, the bound source currents will amount to an azimuthally symmetric
distribution of current rings. The ﬁelds corresponding to such a distribution will then be given by a superposition
of those arising from a corresponding distribution of single current rings.28 Indeed the ﬁelds constructed in Sec. III
are just such a superposition corresponding to bound current rings circulating at the surface of the magnet. Thus
the extension to nonuniform magnetization merely amounts to a more general superposition where the source current
rings are distributed over the volume of the magnet as well as its surface. This generalization will be reﬂected in
Eq. (8) which will be extended to a double integral, and similarly for the integral of Eq. (29) which deﬁnes the drag
force.

The treatment of the magnet-pipe system in this paper has been based on azimuthal symmetry. Therefore, any
deviation of the magnet from a linear, axially centered motion such as wobbling or tumbling would violate this
underlying assumption and cause a departure from the predicted results. It is therefore crucial to minimize any such
deviation where a quantitative comparison with measured results is intended. A convenient method of achieving

this is to place the magnet inside an electromagnetically inactive casing with an optimum proﬁle for stability. This
procedure would also serve to maintain a ﬁxed air drag coeﬃcient when comparing magnets of diﬀerent proﬁle.

Finally, it is worth recalling that our analysis assumes an inﬁnitely long pipe, so that in practice each magnet end
is required to be many times the interior pipe diameter away from the near end of the pipe when measurements are
taken.

16 The dipole radiation can be found from the magnetic dipole radiation formula, (µ0/6πc3) ¨M2, where M is the dipole moment
in question. Using this formula, and recalling that the magnet’s dipole moment in the laboratory frame equals m/γ, we ﬁnd
the result (µ0m2/6πc7)( ˙v2 + v¨v)2. This quantity is in general smaller than the quadrupole radiation by a factor of order
(v/c)2.

17 There is a zeroeth region, (0), deﬁned by 0 ≤ ρ ≤ a, which we have not included here. The potential in this region is obtained
from that in region (i) by substituting the appropriate representation of ˜A(i)(ρ, k) valid for 0 ≤ ρ ≤ a. The latter is deﬁned
in the paragraph following Eq. (7).

19 The imaginary part of Q is positive, a fact that is not readily obvious from its deﬁnition.
20 An analogus situation obtains for the electrostatic force exerted on a charged object by its image with respect to a conducting

or (linear) dielectric medium. Such a force would scale with the square of the real charge.

21 In eﬀect the thin-wall approximation assumes uniform ﬁelds and eddy currents within the pipe wall thus ignoring the
inevitable fall-oﬀ of all disturbances away from the axis. This is the reason why the thin-wall approximation in general
overestimates the drag force.

22 Air drag eﬀects can of course be eliminated by placing the pipe-magnet system in an evacuated chamber.
23 Recall that we have already restricted v to nonrelativistic values.
24 Here we are implicitly assuming that µrel is of the order of unity. We will consider departures from this assumption in V A 3,

and more speciﬁcally, the possibilites of µrel ≪ 1 and µrel ≫ 1 in sections V B 4 and V B 5, respectively.

25 Because the dependence of Q on µ is not just through the Bessel functions, this argument fails to give the full dependence

of the force on µ.

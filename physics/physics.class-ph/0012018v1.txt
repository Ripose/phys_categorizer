METHOD OF REPLACING THE VARIABLES FOR GENERALIZED
SYMMETRY OF D’ALEMBERT EQUATION

It is shown that by generalized understanding of symmetry the D’Alembert equation
for one component ﬁeld is invariant with respect to arbitrary reversible coordinate
transformations.

Symmetries play an important role in particle physics and quantum ﬁeld theory [1],
nuclear physics [2], mathematical physics [3].
It is proposed some receptions for
ﬁnding the symmetries, for example, the method of replacing the variables [4], the
Lie algorithm [3], the theoretical-algebraic approach [5]. The purpose of the present
work is the generalization of the method of replacing the variables. We start from
the following Deﬁnition of symmetry.
Deﬁnition 1 Let some partial diﬀerential equation ˆL′φ′(x′) = 0 be given. By
symmetry of this equation with respect to the variables replacement x′ = x′(x),
φ′ = φ′(Φφ) we shall understand the compatibility of the engaging equations sys-
tem ˆAφ′(Φφ) = 0, ˆLφ(x) = 0, where ˆAφ′(Φφ) = 0 is obtained from the initial
equation by replacing the variables, ˆL′ = ˆL, Φ(x) is some weight function. If the
equation ˆAφ′(Φφ) = 0 can be transformed into the form ˆL(Ψφ) = 0, the symmetry
will be named the standard Lie symmetry, otherwise the generalized symmetry.

2′φ′(x′) =

Elements of this Deﬁnition were used to study the Maxwell equations symmetries
[6-8]. In the present work we shall apply Deﬁnition 1 for investigation of symmetries
of the one-component D’Alembert equation:

Let us introduce the arbitrary reversible coordinate transformations x′ = x′(x) and
the transformation of the ﬁeld variable φ′ = φ(Φφ), where Φ(x) is some unknown
function, as well as take into account ∂φ′/∂x′

∂2φ′/∂x′

Here x = (x1, x2, x3, x4), x4 = ict, c is the speed of light, t is the time. Let us put
the solution of D’Alembert equation φ into the ﬁrst equation of the set (2). If the
obtained equation has a solution, then the set (2) will be compatible. According to
Deﬁnition 1 it will mean that the arbitrary reversible transformations x′ = x′(x) are
the symmetry transformations of the initial equation 2′φ′ = 0. Owing to presence of
the expressions (∂Φφ/∂xj )2 and (∂Φφ/∂xj )(∂Φφ/∂xk) in the ﬁrst equation from the
set (2), the latter has non-linear character. Since the analysis of non-linear systems
is diﬃcult we suppose that

∂2φ′
∂ξ2 = 0.
In this case the non-linear components in the set (2) turn to zero and the system will
be linear. As result we ﬁnd the ﬁeld transformation law by integrating the equation
(3)

(3)

φ′ = C1Φφ + C2 → φ′ = Φφ.

(4)

Here we suppose for simplicity that the constants of integration are C1 = 1, C2 = 0.
It is this law of ﬁeld transformation that was used within the algorithm [7, 8]. It
marks the position of the algorithm in the generalized variables replacement method.
Taking into account the formulae (3) and (4), we ﬁnd the following form for the
system (2):

∂ξ2 = 0;

(5)
Since here Φ(x) = φ′(x′ → x)/φ(x), where φ′(x′) and φ(x) are the solutions of
D’Alembert equation, the system (5) has a common solution and consequently is
compatible. This means that the arbitrary reversible transformations of coordinates
x′ = x′(x) are symmetry transformations for the one-component D’Alembert equa-
tion if the ﬁeld is transformed with the help of weight function Φ(x) according to
the law (4). The form of this function depends on D’Alembert equation solutions
and the law of the coordinate transformations x′ = x′(x).

Next we shall consider the following examples.
Let the coordinate transformations belong to the Poincar´e group P10:

where Ljk is the matrix of the Lorentz group L6, aj are the parameters of the transla-
k L′
tion group T4. In this case we have 2′xj =

where Pj, Mjk are the generators of Poincar´e group, j, k, l = 1, 2, 3, 4. In the space of
D’Alembert equation solutions the set deﬁnes a rule of the change from a solution to
solution. The weight function Φ(x) = 1 ∈ ΦP10(x) determines the transformational
properties of the solutions φ′ = φ, which means the well-known relativistic symmetry
of D’Alembert equation [9, 10].

ρ′2δjk = ρ−2δjk. The set (5) reduces to the set (7) and has the solution ΦW11 = CΦP10,
where C=const. The weight function Φ(x) = C and the law φ′ = Cφ means the
well-known Weyl symmetry of D’Alembert equation [9, 10]. Let here C be equal ρl,
where l is the conformal dimension 1 of the ﬁeld φ(x). Consequently, D’Alembert
equation is W11-invariant for the ﬁeld φ with arbitrary conformal dimension l. This
property is essential for the Voigt [4] and Umov [12] works as will be shown just
below.

The substitution of Φ(x) = x2Ψ(x) transforms the equation (11) for Φ(x) into the
equation 2Ψφ = 0 for Ψ(x). It is a sign of the Lie symmetry. The equation has
the solution Ψ = 1. The result is Φ(x) = x2. Consequently, the ﬁeld transforms ac-
cording to the law φ′ = x2φ(x) = ρ−1(x)φ(x). This means the conformal dimension
l = −1 of the ﬁeld φ(x) in the case of D’Alembert equation symmetry with respect
to the Inversion group I in agreement with [5, 10]. In a general case the weight
function belongs to the set:

ΦI(x) = x2Ψ(x) ∈

1The conformal dimension is the number l characterizing the behavior of the ﬁeld under scale

(13)

In this case we have 2′xj = 4(aj − a2xj)σ(x),
σ2(x)δjk. The set (5) reduces to the set:

(14)

∂Φφ
∂xj

The substitution of Φ(x) = σ(x)Ψ(x) transforms the equation (14) into the equation
2Ψφ = 0 which corresponds to the Lie symmetry. From this equation we have
Ψ = 1, Φ(x) = σ(x). Therefore φ′ = σ(x)φ(x) and the conformal dimension of the
ﬁeld is l = −1 as above. Analogously to (12), the weight function belongs to the
set:

ΦC4(x) = σ(x)Ψ(x) ∈

σ(x);

From here we can see that φ(x) = 1/σ(x) is the solution of D’Alembert equation.
Combination of W11, I and C4 symmetries means the well-known D’Alembert equa-
tion conformal C15-symmetry [5, 9, 10].

in a similar way.

Let us note that in the symmetry theory of D’Alembert equation, the conditions

In
the case of the W11-coordinate transformations belonging to the set of arbitrary
transformations x′ = x′(x) the requirements for the one component ﬁeld with l =
0 were found by Umov (1910) [12]. The requirement that the second derivative
∂2φ′/∂φα∂φβ = 0 with Φ = 1 be turned into zero was introduced by Di Jorio
(1974). The weight function Φ 6= 1 and the set (5) were proposed by the author of
the present work (1982, 1985, 1995) [6 - 8].

0 = ω0/ρ, k′x′ = kx - inv.

By now well-studied have been only the D’Alembert equation symmetries cor-
responding to the linear systems of the type (7), (11), (14). These are the well-
known relativistic and conformal symmetry of the equation. The investigations
corresponding to the linear conditions (5) are much more scanty and presented only
in the papers [6 - 8]. The publications corresponding to the non-linear conditions
(2) are absent completely. The diﬃculties arising here are connected with analysis
of compatibility of the set (2) containing the non-linear partial diﬀerential equation.
Thus it is shown that with the generalized understanding of the symmetry ac-
cording to Deﬁnition 1, D’Alembert equation for one component ﬁeld is invariant
with respect to any arbitrary reversible coordinate transformations x′ = x′(x). In
particular, they contain the transformations of the conformal and Galilei groups re-
alizing the type of standard and generalized symmetry for Φ(x) = φ′(x′ → x)/φ(x).
The concept of partial diﬀerential equations symmetry is conventional.

Both the Mie coeﬃcients and the electromagnetic ﬁeld distributions in the two-layered sphere

containing left-handed media irradiated by a planar electromagnetic wave are presented.

I. INTRODUCTION

More recently, a kind of artiﬁcial composite media ( the so-called left-handed media ) having a frequency band where
the eﬀective permittivity ( ε ) and the eﬀective permeability ( µ ) are simultaneously negative attracts attention of
many researchers in various ﬁelds such as materials science, condensed matter physics, optics and electromagnetism
[1–5]. Veselago1 ﬁrst considered this peculiar medium and showed that it possesses a negative index of refraction [6].
It follows from the Maxwell’s equations that in this medium the Poynting vector and wave vector of electromagnetic
wave would be antiparallel, i. e., the vector k, the electric ﬁeld E and the magnetic ﬁeld H form a left-handed
system; thus Veselago referred to such materials as “left-handed”, and correspondingly, the ordinary medium in which
k, E and H form a right-handed system may be termed the “right-handed” medium. Other authors call this class
of materials “negative-index media (NIM)”, “double negative media (DNM)” [5] and Veselago’s media. It is readily
veriﬁed that in such media having both ε and µ negative, there exist a number of peculiar electromagnetic properties,
for instance, many dramatically diﬀerent propagation characteristics stem from the sign change of the group velocity,
including reversals of both the Doppler shift and the Cherenkov radiation, anomalous refraction, modiﬁed spontaneous
emission rates and even reversals of radiation pressure to radiation tension [2]. In experiments, this artiﬁcial negative
electric permittivity media may be obtained by using the array of long metallic wires (ALMWs), which simulates the
plasma behavior at microwave frequencies, and the artiﬁcial negative magnetic permeability media may be built up by
using small resonant metallic particles, e. g., the split ring resonators (SRRs), with very high magnetic polarizability
[3,7–9].

The extinction properties of a sphere ( single-layered ) with negative permittivity and permeability is investigated by
100
Ruppin. Since recently Wang and Asher developed a novel method to fabricate nanocomposite SiO2 spheres (
5 nm ) [10], which may has potential applications
nm ) containing homogeneously dispersed Ag quantum dots ( 2
to design and fabrication of photonic crystals, it is believed that the absorption and transmittance of double-layered
sphere deserves consideration. In this paper, we present Mie coeﬃcients of double-layered sphere and consider the
scattering problem, including the topics on ﬁeld distribution, electromagnetic cross section, extinction spectra as well
as some potential peculiar properties arising from the presence of left-handed media. The formulation presented here
can be easily generalized to cases of multiple-layered spheres.

It is well known that in the absence of electromagnetic sources, the characteristic vectors such as E, B, D, H and

Hertz vector in the isotropic homogeneous media agree with the same diﬀerential equation

Note that, in the literature, many authors mention the year when Veselago suggested the left-handed media by mistake.
They claim that Veselago proposed the concept of left-handed media in 1968. On the contrary, the true fact is as follows:
Veselago’s excellent paper was ﬁrst published in July, 1964 [Usp. Fiz. Nauk 92, 517-526 (1964)]. In 1968, this original paper
was translated into English by W. H. Furry and published again in the journal of Sov. Phys. Usp. [6].

A. Deﬁnitions

We consider a double-layered sphere with interior radius a1 and external radius a2 having relative permittivity
(permeability) ǫ1 (µ1) and ǫ2 ( µ2), respectively, placed in a medium having the relative permittivity ǫ0 and perme-
ability µ0. Suppose that the double-layered sphere irradiated by the following plane wave with the electric amplitude

deserves consideration by using the Mie coeﬃcients presented above.

Based on the calculation of Mie coeﬃcients, one can treat the scattering problem of double-layered sphere irradiated
by a plane wave. The scattering and absorption properties of double-layered sphere containing left-handed media can
thus be discussed in detail, which are now under consideration and will be submitted elsewhere for the publication.

This, therefore, means that the Mie coeﬃcients of double-layered sphere presented here is right.

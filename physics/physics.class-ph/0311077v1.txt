Abstract

Using a lattice string model, a number of peculiar excitation situations related to non-propagating

excitations and non-radiating sources are demonstrated. External ﬁelds can be used to trap ex-

citations locally but also lead to the ability to steer such excitations dynamically as long as the

steering is slower than the ﬁeld’s wave propagation. I present explicit constructions of a number of

examples, including temporally limited non-propagating excitations, directional excitation and vir-

tually slowed propagation. Using these dynamical lattice constructions I demonstrate that neither

persistent temporal oscillation nor static localization are necessary for non-propagating excitations

to occur.

INTRODUCTION

Can a local excitation (source) in classical ﬁeld theories be invisible to observers outside

the region of excitation? This question has recently received renewed interest.

Berry et al. [1] described a peculiar excitation case for the one-dimensional wave-equation

of a perfectly elastic string under tension. They show that the response of the string can

be made to be conﬁned to a bounded region by carefully choosing a forced excitation of

oscillatory type. This means that the excitation will not propagate away along the string.

Denardo gives a simple and intuitive explanation by using a wave interference argument [2].

Gbur et al [3] discuss conditions of ﬁnite string length and dissipation.

Other recent work investigated non-propagating excitations include Marengo and Zi-

[4, 5, 6] who discuss the generalization of non-propagating conditions of

olkowski
D’Alembertian ((cid:3) def
∂t2 ) operators and its temporally reduced version the Helmholtz
operator (∇2 + k2) on various related classical scalar and vector ﬁelds. Hoenders and Fer-

= ∇2 −c2 ∂2

werda [7] discuss the relationship of non-radiating and radiating parts of the case of the

reduced Helmholtz equation, which can be derived from the string equation by assuming

general oscillatory time solutions (see [1]). Denardo and Miller [8] discuss the related case

of leakage from an imperfect non-propagating excitation on a string. Gbur [9] provides a

comprehensive recent review of this topic.

In this paper our purpose is to describe this phenomena in the case of a lattice string

in one dimensions by discretizing D’Alembert’s solution. This approach is used extensively

to simulate vibrating strings and air tubes of musical instruments. See [10] and references

therein.

This leads to explicit dynamical constructions of previously reported non-propagating

excitations. Its simplicity allows for additional insight into the mechanism that allows for

the local conﬁnements and the conditions under which they occurs. I will show how the

basic mechanisms that provide a time-harmonic stationary non-propagating excitation as

studied by Berry et al. and Gbur et al. [1, 3] allows for a much wider class of excitations.

For instance can such an excitation be relieved from the time-harmonic assumption beyond

one period allowing for non-propagating sources that are short-lived. Directional excitations

can easily be achieved using very simple bidirectional excitation patterns. Wave propagation

can be virtually slowed down. In general I will show that non-propagating excitations can

2

be extended to steered excitation regions with basic physical restrictions imposed by the

underlying ﬁeld dynamics.

First I will give a quick derivation of the simple lattice model from the wave equation as

can also be found in [10]. Then I will give a new argument and construction of the Berry

et al. type non-propagating excitation purely based on discrete string dynamics. This will

then be compared to the original approach. Then I will extend the discuss to examples of

additional types of non-propagating waves, including directional and slowed waves. Finally

I will discuss very general constraints on such “steered” localized excitations.

II. LATTICE STRING MODEL

The lattice string model can easily be derived from the wave-equation by discretizing the

D’Alembert solution. Hence the continuous case will be discussed ﬁrst.

A. Continuous Wave Solutions

The one-dimensional homogeneous wave equation of the perfectly elastic string under

tension is:

µ

∂2y
∂t2 − K

∂2y
∂x2 = 0

(1)

(2)

where c2 = K/µ is derived from mass density µ and tension K. The D’Alembert solution

of the homogeneous “free ﬁeld” case has the well known form [11, p. 596, eq. (4)]:

y(x, t) = w+(x − ct) + w−(x + ct)

Hence the solution of the general of the homogeneous wave-equation are two propagating

waves whose content is restricted by initial and boundary conditions. As wave-equation is

linear we have a connection between initial conditions and external driving forces. Driving

forces can be seen as inﬁnitesimal time frames that act on the wave dynamics by imposing

a new initial condition at each point in time. Hence we need to consider the initial value

problem to gain insight into both processes at once.

At a given time frame ti let the following initial conditions hold:

3

y(x, ti) = f (x, ti)

yt(x, ti) = g(x, ti)

Equation (3) with (2) gives a particular solution v+:

v+(x − cti) + v−(x + cti) = f (x, ti)

Taking the ﬁrst temporal derivative of (2) and satisfying equation (4) we get:

−cv+

t (x − cti) + cv−

t (x + cti) = g(x, ti)

Integrating with respect to x we get [11, eq. (10) p. 596]:

−cv+(x − cti) + cv−(x + cti) = k(x0) +

g(s)ds,

x

Z

x0

k(x0) = −cv+(x0) + cv−(x0)

From equations (5) and (7) we can solve for the traveling wave components:

v+(x − cti) =

f (x, ti) −

v−(x + cti) =

f (x, ti) +

We see that forced displacement f (·) splits evenly between left and right traveling waves

and the integrated forced velocity g(·) splits with a sign inversion.

For our current discussion I will share the assumption of no initial velocity of Berry et

al. [1] and hence the integral over g(·) will vanish.

For the inﬁnite string this is already the complete solution for any twice diﬀerentiable

functions of free solutions and external forced displacements.

4

B. Discrete Wave Solutions

To arrive at lattice equations we discretize the solution of the wave-equation (2) in time

via the substitution t → T n where T is the discrete time-step and n is the discrete time

index. This automatically corresponds to a discretization in space as well, because in ﬁnite

time T a wave will travel X = cT distance according to (2). The spatial index will be called

m. The free-ﬁeld discrete D’Alembert solution:

y(mX, nT ) =w+(mX − cnT ) + w−(mX + cnT )

(10)

In general we can always express all discrete equations in terms of ﬁnite time steps or

ﬁnite spatial lengths. We chose a temporal expression and substitute X = cT and suppress

shared terms in cT to arrive at the index version of the discrete D’Alembert solution [10]:

y(m, n) = w+(m − n) + w−(m + n)

(11)

By equations (8) and (9) we see that at an instance mi, ni the discrete contribution of

external forced displacements splits evenly between the traveling waves and we arrive at the

discrete ﬁeld equations including external forced displacements:

W +(mi − ni) = w+(mi − ni) +

f (mi, ni)

W −(mi − ni) = w−(mi − ni) +

f (mi, ni)

III. NON-PROPAGATING EXCITATION

Next we will construct the non-propagating excitation from the lattice string dynamics

directly.

For simplicity and without loss of generality, we will assume a region aligning with the

discretization domain throughout. We want to construct an excitation which is conﬁned to

a length −L ≤ x ≤ L. For now we will assume that the string should otherwise stay at rest.

This implies that there are no incoming waves into the region Ω = [−L, L] from the outside.

We are interested in a non-trivial excitation within the region.

5

First we consider the contributions to the position −L. As there are no incoming external

waves we get:

w+(−L + n) = 0

(14)

We do expect non-trivial wave w−(−L − n) to reach the boundary but we require the

total outgoing wave to vanish we have:

W −(−L − n) = w−(−L − n) +

f (−L, n) = 0

(15)

1
2

The necessary external forced displacement contribution to for cancellation needs to be:

f (−L, n) = −w−(−L − n)

1
2

(16)

The complete incoming wave (12) will see the same forced contribution (16) and with

equation (14) we get:

W +(−L + n) =

f (−L, n) = −w−(−L − n)

(17)

Hence the matched forced displacement leads to a reﬂection with sign inversion at the

region boundary at −L.

Following the same line of argument at point L we get the related condition:

W −(L − n) =

f (L, n) = −w+(L + n)

(18)

With these two conditions we can study the permissible form of excitations. First we

assume an initial forced displacement impulse from a position p in the interior of the domain
Ω \ ∂Ω = (−L, L). Hence −L < p < L and f (p, 0) = ap with ap ∈ R.

It will take half the impulse L + p steps to reach the left boundary and the other half

L − p steps to reach the right one.

At each boundary the respective condition (17,18) needs to be satisﬁed and we get:

1
2

1
2

6

The impulse will then reﬂect back and create periodic matching conditions.

f (−L, L + p) = −f (p, 0)

f (L, L − p) = −f (p, 0)

f (−L, L + p + 4Lν) = f (p, 0)

f (−L, L − p + (2ν − 1)2L) = −f (p, 0)

f (L, L − p + 4Lν) = f (p, 0)

f (L, L + p + (2ν − 1)2L) = −f (p, 0)

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

with ν = 1, 2, · · · .

Hence we see that a single impulse will necessitate an inﬁnite periodic series of forced

external displacements at the boundaries to trap the impulse inside as each “annihilation”

of a half-pulse reaching the boundary leads to a “creation” of a reﬂected one.

The required impulse response of a boundary forced function f (±L, ·) can easily be ob-

served from equations (21–24) to be spatially periodic in 4L with an initial phase factor

dictated by the starting position p. Additionally the functional shape of the impulse re-

sponses f (±L, ·) is completely deﬁned for all time steps as f (±L, ·) = 0 for all times that

equations (21–24) don’t apply.

A condition for stopping a non-propagating excitation can be derived from the fact that

a impulse will return to its initial position every 4L time steps. Additionally it is easy to

see that the traveling impulses will occupy the same spatial position every odd multiple
of 2L with a sign inversion. Hence an impulsive forced displacement f ((−1)µ−1p, 4Lµ) =
(−1)µ−1ap with µ = 1, 2, · · · will cancel an initial impulse f (p, 0) = ap. From this we can

immediately deduce the following property:

Theorem 1 The shortest possible single impulse ﬁnite non-propagating excitation takes 2L

time-steps.

and more generally:

Theorem 2 The time of any single impulse excitation ﬁnite non-propagating excitation has
to be 2µL, µ ∈ N.

7

More importantly we observe the property: Non-propagating excitations can be ﬁnite in

duration.

progressions in their derivations.

This is an extension beyond Berry et al. [1] which assumes inﬁnitely periodic temporal

The general solution for discrete non-propagating wave functions can be derived by ob-

serving that any initial “phase” pi is orthogonal to other phases pj for i, j ∈ Ω\∂Ω = (−L, L),

i.e.

hf (pi, 0), f (pj, 0)i = 0 for i 6= j. Within a 2L period f (±L, ·) is well-deﬁned by

i f (pi, ·). Interestingly though this provides the only restriction to the forced boundary
P
functions. This can be seen by Theorem 1. After 2L each pi will ﬁnd constructive inter-

ference and can be annihilated or rescaled to an arbitrary other value ai(2L). Hence any

arbitrary succession of 2L−2 force distributions with a 2L termination is permissible. Hence

periodicity is not necessary.

The time harmonic case can be derived if the initial force distribution within the domain

is not modiﬁed over time. Then a conﬁguration will repeat after traveling left and right,

being reﬂected at the domain boundary twice, traversing the length of the region twice.

Hence the lowest permissible wave-length is 4L. By reﬂecting twice the wave will have

gone through a 2π phase shift, but we note that the periodicity condition is also satisﬁed

if any number of additional 2π shifts have been accumulated. Hence we get for permissible

wave-numbers:

or

k =

2πn
4L

,

where n = 1, 2, · · · .

(25)

(26)

By allowing only even n we get the Berry at al. condition [1] for an even square dis-

tribution. The odd n situation corresponds to the odd-harmonic out-of-phase construction

proposed by Denardo [2].

Figure 1.

Many of these properties can be seen visually in the numerical simulation depicted in

It is interesting to observe that two synchronous point-sources oscillating with the above

phase condition will not be completely non-propagating. They will only be non-propagating

kL =

nπ
2

after waves created at the wave onset have escaped. This is a reﬁnement of the argument

put forward by Denardo [2] and can intuitively be described as non-interference of the ﬁrst

trap period. Hence the ﬁrst pairs of pulses will have half-Amplitude components escaping

in either direction but every subsequent period will be trapped. This behavior, which could

be called imperfect trapping or trapping with transient radiation, is depicted in Figure 2.

Sources presented by Berry et al. and Denardo [1, 2] do not display this behavior because

the force is assumed to be oscillatory at all times and hence has no onset moment.

Non-propagating excitations can be used as generic building blocks for other unusual

excitation induced behavior on the string. In particular I will next describe how to construct

an uni-directional emitter, and a virtually slowed propagation. In fact a non-propagating

excitation can be seen as virtually stopping a wave at a particular position.

IV. DIRECTIONAL EXCITATIONS

A one-sided open trap immediately suggests another unusual excitation type, namely the

directional excitation. The string is to be excited in such a way that a traveling wave in

only one direction results.

We start with a one-sided open trap. This is a trap that uses a reﬂection condition (17)

and (18) only on one side of an initial excitation. Evidently the wave then can only travel

in the opposite direction. For the discussion we will describe a right-sided propagator (i.e.

a propagator traveling with increasing negative index). The trapping condition then reads:

f (m + 1 + p, n + p) = −f (m, n − 1)

(27)

Hence the trapping excitation point is a p time-step lagging negative copy of the original

excitation. The emitted wave will have the form

1
2

1
2

f (m + 1, n + 2p) −

f (m + 1, n)

(28)

The emitting wave will show self-interference at a phase of 2p time-steps. In general the

self-interference phase can be chosen by the distance p between the wave creation point and

the trapping point. It is worth noting that it is possible to eliminate interference by trapping

9

the lagging contribution and hence create a wave non-interference directional wave left of

the trapping region.

V. VIRTUAL SLOW WAVES

Virtual slow waves can be achieved by alternating directional wave propagation with

trapping. The slowness of the wave propagation can be controlled by the number and

and duration times of the traps along a propagation. The propagation characteristics of

the dynamic operator has not changed at all, hence we call the this state “virtually slow”

as opposed to the case where the ﬁeld itself induces a change in wave propagation speed.

This also means that within a slowed or “steered” region the wave propagation is the one
prescribed by the dynamic operator ( ∂
∂t )( ∂
The amount of time spend in traps determines the overall slowness. One example of

∂t ) on the string y(x, t).

∂x − c ∂

∂x + c ∂

slow wave consists of an immediate alteration between one stage of trapping and one step of

one-sided propagation is illustrated in Figure 4. The eﬀective propagation speed of the wave

can easily be read from the diagram to give ceﬀ = c X

3T = c/3. As is evident from Theorem
1, a unit L = 1 trap will last 2 time-steps and will not propagate spatially and one step of

free propagation will last one time-step and and make one spatial step, hence resulting in a

spatial to temporal ratio of 1 : 3.

The trapping relations are:

f (m − 2 − ν, n + 1 + 6ν) = f (m + 1 − ν, n + 6ν)

f (m − 3 − ν, n + 4 + 6ν) = f (m − ν, n + 3 + 6ν)

= −f (m, n − 1)

= f (m, n − 1)

(29)

(30)

with ν = 0, 2, 4, · · · .

VI. STEERING

The generalized interpretation of the excitation interaction lead to the general dynamical

conﬁnement of waves by external excitation. For instance following very similar arguments

10

as for virtual slow waves a construction is possible which gives a slowed “cone of inﬂuence”

by successively widening the trap boundaries at a speed slower than the the wave speed c.

By this argument it is suﬃcient for the trap boundaries’ change to be less than c for it to be

trapping the wave. This is not a necessary condition by the following counter-example: Let

the trap width be L and change rapidly by some slope dL > c to some new constant width

L2 at which it becomes constant. Obviously the wave will then be able to reach the new

boundary even though a local change of the boundary excited the dynamical speed c. The

necessary condition can be seen from our previous construction. At a trap boundary a wave

is reﬂected and will propagate in the opposite direction of the domain following the linear

characteristic c. Only if this characteristics intersects with the dynamic trapping boundary

will there be another externally forced reﬂection as illustrated in Figure 5. These may in

fact have regions where no trapping is necessary and possible.

VII.

INTERACTION WITH BACKGROUND FIELDS

It is important to note that while we assumed that the incoming wave vanishes, see

equation (14), the outgoing wave condition (15) does not change if there is in fact an incoming

wave. The “reﬂection wave” (17) and (18) can be rewritten for a non-zero incoming ﬁeld

without aﬀecting the trapping:

and

W +(−L + n) = w+(−L + n) +

f (−L, n)

f (−L, n) = −w−(−L − n)

1
2

W −(L − n) = w−(L − n) +

f (L, n)

f (L, n) = −w+(L − n)

1
2

1
2

1
2

(31)

(32)

These conditions are “absorbing” in the sense that an external ﬁeld entering the trapping

region will not leave it.

The “non-interacting” property of a trap deﬁned by the periodic matching conditions (21–

24) can be seen by assuming a non-zero incoming wave at one point of the trap boundary

δΩ. Then the total wave entering the trapping region the sum of the wave created by the

11

2f (δΩ1, ·) + w±(δΩ1, ·), where δΩ1 denotes
trapping condition and the incoming wave value 1
the ﬁrst trap boundary reached. When reaching the second trapping boundary δΩ2 the now
outgoing wave will see a matching force f (δΩ2, ·) = − 1
2 f (δΩ1, ·) leaving an outgoing wave
contribution w±(δΩ2, ·) = w±(δΩ1, ·) to escape the trapping region Ω.

In order to achieve selective radiation, only part of the content of a trapped region

are trapped at the boundary as can be achieved by using a reduced force at the trapping

boundary or by selectively omitting certain phases in the trapping force pattern.

A. Relationship of Traps to Non-Radiating Sources

Marengo and Ziolkowsi [4] present ideas very much related to ideas presented here and

in Berry et al.[1].

radiate waves.

However, they arrive at a deﬁnition of non-radiating (NR) sources that is not obviously

similar to the traps presented here.

In particular they deﬁne NR sources as being non-

interacting. While [4] note that a central property of NR sources is that they store non-

trivial ﬁeld energy, traps described here can not only store, but accumulate and selectively

The diﬀerence can be understood by observing that for example Berry et al. assume a

simple time-harmonic driver [1, eq. (3)] throughout their discussion:

f (x, t) = Re

f (x)e−iωt
(cid:8)

(cid:9)

(33)

By our earlier discussion we see that the temporal progression of the boundary has to

match the content of the interior domain. Hence once the boundary is deﬁned to be os-

cillatory the interior of the domain needs to be spatially harmonic as derived in [1, 4] and

has been rederived here. Hence a NR source as noted in literature can be thought of as a

time-oscillatory trap.

The arguments made here use a formalism that is discrete in nature. However, the

discreteness of the arguments are not necessarily restrictive. The continuous case can be

imagined with the discrete time-step made small (T → 0) or alternatively, discrete pulses

can be substituted with narrow distributions of compact support. In neither case are the

results of interest derived here altered.

12

As has already been derived in [1, 3] the critical condition for non-propagating waves lie

at the boundary of the domain-range that the wave ought not to leave. In the discrete case

it is easy to see how this insight can be used and generalized. In fact, the boundaries of the

conﬁning domain need not be static, nor need the condition be used in a two-sided fashion.

VIII. CONCLUSION

In summary, this paper presented constructions of a broad class of non-propagating

sources on a string lattice model using trapping conditions.

In particular this includes

numerical demonstrations of ﬁnite-duration non-propagating excitations, directional exci-

tations, as well as virtually slowed waves. These examples help explain the extension of

non-propagating sources beyond the time-periodic case and include treatment of onset, an-

nihilation and spatial steering. These properties ought to be observable in experiments

well-described by the wave equation.

FIG. 3: Simulation of a directional excitation of width 3. The deﬂected component experienced a

sign inversion. The temporal length of the excitation sequence is two, including the initial impulse.

Top: Complete wave. Bottom: Excitations only.

FIG. 4: Simulation of a ﬁnite-duration virtual slow wave excitation of width 3. The wave is

annihilated after 10 steps. Top: Complete wave. Bottom: Excitation only.

FIG. 5: A grazing propagating wave against a changing trap boundary can create regions (gray)

in which no trap aﬀect applies.

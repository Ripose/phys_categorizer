The U-CAS is a spinning magnetized top that is levitated in a static magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁeld is produced by a
permanent magnet base, positioned below the hovering top. In this paper we derive upper and lower bounds for hm–the
maximum hovering height of this top. We show that the bounds are of the form al0 where a is a dimensionless number
ranging from about 1 to 12, depending on the constraints on the shape of the base and on stability considerations, and
l0 is a characteristic length, given by

A. What is the U-CAS?

I. Introduction

The U-CAS is an ingenious device that hovers in mid-air while spinning. It is marketed as a kit
in Japan under the trade name U-CAS [1], and in the U.S.A. and Europe under the trade name
LevitronTM [2], [3], [4]. The whole kit consists of three main parts: A magnetized top which weighs
about 18 gr, a thin (lifting) plastic plate and a magnetized square base plate (base). To operate the
top one should set it spinning on the plastic plate that covers the base. The plastic plate is then raised
slowly with the top until a point is reached in which the top leaves the plate and spins in mid-air above
the base for about 2 min. The hovering height of the top is approximately 3 cm above the surface of
2 cm. The kit comes with extra brass and
10 cm
the base whose dimensions are about 10 cm
plastic ﬁne tuning weights, as the apparatus is very sensitive to the weight of the top. It also comes
with two wedges to balance the base horizontally.

B. The adiabatic approximation.

The physical principle underlying the operation of the U-CAS relies on the so-called ‘adiabatic
approximation’ [5], [6], [7]: As the top is launched, its magnetic moment points antiparallel to the
magnetization of the base in order to supply the repulsive magnetic force which will act against the
gravitational pull. As the top hovers, it experiences lateral oscillations which are slow ( Ωlateral ≃
1
5 Hz). The latter itself, is small compared to the top’s
Hz) compared to its precession (Ωprecession ∼
Ωprecession the top is considered ‘fast’ and acts like a classical
25 Hz). Since Ωspin ≫
spin (Ωspin ∼
Ωlateral this spin may be considered as experiencing a slowly
spin. Furthermore, as Ωprecession ≫
rotating magnetic ﬁeld. Under these circumstances the spin precesses around the local direction of
the magnetic ﬁeld B (adiabatic approximation) and, on the average, its magnetic moment µ points
antiparallel to the local magnetic ﬁeld lines. In view of this discussion, the magnetic interaction energy

where m is the mass of the top, g is the free-fall acceleration and z is the height of the top above
the base. By virtue of the adiabatic approximation, two of the three rotational degrees of freedom
are coupled to the transverse translational degrees of freedom, and as a result the rotation of the axis
of the top is already incorporated in Eq.(1). Thus, under the adiabatic approximation, the top may
be considered as a point-like particle whose only degrees of freedom are translational. The important
point of this discussion is the following: The energy expression written above possesses a minimum
for certain values of µ/mg. Thus, when the mass is properly tuned, the apparatus acts as a trap,
and stable hovering becomes possible. A detailed description of this device, extending beyond the
adiabatic approximation, may be found elsewhere
[6], [8], [9]. For the purpose of this paper, the
adiabatic approximation will suﬃce.

C. The limitations on the hovering height.

In this paper we focus on the question:

How high can the hovering height of the U-CAS be?

First, we deﬁne what do we mean by ‘height’: We assume that the top hovers above some horizontal
plane. The height of the top is measured with respect to that plane. The ‘rules of the game’ are, that
we can put permanent magnet below the plane, but never above this plane. Whatever is below this
plane, will be called ‘the base’. The method we use to answer the question above will be by getting
upper and lower bounds for this height, denoted by hm. We begin by pointing out the factors that
limit the hovering height of the U-CAS.

First, we set aside the question of stability and assume that the top is guided by a vertical axis,
allowing it to move only axially (up and down). In this case, the easiest way to increase h–the hovering
height, is by using a more powerful magnet for the base. This technique however, cannot be applied
indeﬁnitely since there is no way to increase the magnetization of a given substance without limit.
We are therefore forced to limit the strength of M(r)–the magnetization density of the base, to some
maximum value, say M0, and design the shape and magnetization density of the base so as to maximize
h. One more factor that limits the levitation height is the amount of magnetic substance, or volume, in
our disposal. Clearly, the more material we use, the larger is the levitation height that can be achieved.
But still, even if the volume is inﬁnite the levitation height is bounded, since

is bounded.

When stability is taken into account, things get more complicated. Stability sets another limitation
on the design of the base, in addition to the limitations that were discussed above: A brief look at
Eq.(1) tells us that for the top to hover stably over the plate, the eﬀective energy Eeﬀ should possess
a minimum. This means, in particular, that

where the derivatives are evaluated at the equilibrium position of the top. Since these are homogenous
inequalities, it is clear that the region in space where a minimum may occur, does not depend on the
strength of the magnetic ﬁeld. As a consequence, the hovering height of the U-CAS is not determined
by the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld but on its geometry, or alternatively, by the shape of the base.
As an example, it has been shown [10] that for a vertically magnetized base in the shape of a disk of
radius R, the range of heights h for which stable hovering is possible, is very narrow and is around
h
10 cm and

R/2. This result agrees roughly with the parameters of the U-CAS, for which R

comes into play by tuning it in order to achieve equilibrium for a given mass of the top. Equilibrium
prevails when the total force on the top vanishes, i.e. when

Both in the guided case and in the stable case, we see that in order to increase the hovering height
of the U-CAS, we should design a better base. We do expect however, that the hovering height cannot
be increased indeﬁnitely. In connection with the redesigning of the base, we have recently shown [11],
both theoretically and experimentally, that the use of a vertically magnetized ring of radius R as a
base, increases the hovering height by more than three times to about 1.7R!. This increase in height
did not came without cost, as the tolerance on the mass of the top became more stringent, being

D. The structure of this paper.

what is the motivation behind it.

All the calculations that we do are outlined in Sec.(II). We will now describe what we calculate and

We start in Sec.(II-A), by deriving a close form expression for the ﬁrst and second derivatives of the
magnetic ﬁeld, in terms of the magnetization density of the base. The ﬁrst derivative is the magnetic
force on the top, which is used throughout the paper, while the second derivative is exploited when
we discuss stability.

In Sec.(II-B) we consider the problem of maximizing the hovering height in the case where the volume
of the base may be inﬁnite, and may be arbitrarily magnetized under the constraint that
= M0.
We still do not require that the top be stable against lateral translations, and assume that it is guided
along a vertical axis. We show that in this case

M(r)

hmax ≃
where l0 is a characteristic height for the problems that are discussed in this paper. It is deﬁned as

12l0,

l0 ≡

,

hmax ≃

3.5l0.

where µ0 is the magnetic permeability of the vacuum, µ is the magnetic moment of the top, m is the
mass of the top, and g is the free-fall acceleration.

In Sec.(II-C) we consider the same problem as before but for a base which is uniformly magnetized
along the vertical direction, namely M(r) = M0ˆz, where ˆz is a unit vector in the vertical direction. In
this case we ﬁnd that

In order to arrive to better bounds on hm, our next step is to limit the amount of material available
for the base. Thus, in Sec.(II-D) we maximize the hovering height in the case where the base may be
= M0, and that its volume V0 is given. Here,
arbitrarily magnetized under the constraint that

the result is given in the form of a plot, showing the dependence hmax on V0. In the limit V0 → ∞

we recover the result of Sec.(II-B). Our derivation is also constructive in the sense that it shows how
to construct the optimal base for a given V0. In this paper however, we do not discuss this matter
thoroughly due to space shortage.

M(r)

|

For completeness, we study in Sec.(II-E) the same problem as in Sec.(II-D), but for a uniformly
magnetized base. Here, again we ﬁnd the dependence of hmax on V0 and recover the result of Sec.(II-
C).

Sec.(II-F) is the ﬁrst part where stability is added into play: We begin by explaining how to test for
stability of the top under the adiabatic approximation, and study the possible levitation heights of a
uniformly magnetized base whose shape is cylindrical of volume V0. As the stability condition is given
in the form of inequality relations (see Eq.(2)), it is not suﬃce to determine uniquely the levitation
height. We therefore choose to study two particular stable points: an isotropic stable point and the
highest possible stable point. The meaning of these points would become clear later. In this case we
also give a plot, showing the dependence of hmax on V0. This result should also be considered as a
lower bound for hm, since the cylindrical base is a special case of all the base conﬁgurations that are
possible.

In section(II-G) we take one step further, and generalize the result of section(II-F) to the case of a
base which may be arbitrarily magnetized, and look for the lowest possible stable point. In this case
however, we assume that V0 =
, to ease the solution of the problem. We also show that in this case,
∞
, the lowest possible stable point and the highest one coincide, so this
where hmax ≃
result represent not a bound for hm, but is actually hm itself, for the case V0 =

8.4l0 and V0 =

.

In Sec.(III) we discuss interesting aspects of our results. In particular we estimate the value of l0
for modern permanent magnet materials and calculate the values of the bounds for hm. We comment
on the implications of our results and discuss other related questions.

A. The upward magnetic force and its derivative.

II. Mathematical Formulation

A simpliﬁed model of the U-CAS is shown in Fig.(1). It consists of a point-like particle of mass
m and magnetic moment µ (pointing downward), hovering at a height h above the z = 0 plane. For
the moment, we consider the top as if it was guided along the z-axis so that only its vertical motion
is allowed. Other degrees of freedom are considered ‘frozen’. The region z < 0 may be partially or
wholly ﬁlled with a magnetized substance (“base”), whose magnetization density is denoted by M(r),
producing a magnetic ﬁeld throughout space which we denote by B(r). In what follows, we assume
that the base (and hence the magnetic ﬁeld) has a cylindrical symmetry around the z-axis. Thus, along
this axis the magnetic ﬁeld possesses only a z-component. We further assume that this component is
positive, namely that the magnetic ﬁeld along the z-axis is pointing upward.

Using Eqs.(1),(3) we ﬁnd that, when the top is in equilibrium, the total vertical component of the

force on the top vanishes,

Since the top is allowed to move only along the z-axis, we may write

we deserve the notation Bz to denote the z-component of the magnetic ﬁeld along the z-axis, namely

is located at z and pointing downward and the other is at an inﬁnitesimally higher position z + dz and
pointing upward, with their magnetic moment being 1/dz.

B. Arbitrarily magnetized, inﬁnite base.

We consider an inﬁnitesimal volume element at some point (r, θ) within the base. It is essentially
a magnetic dipole whose magnitude is M0, and whose direction we will now ﬁnd by the requirement
that the magnetic force on the top is maximized. We have already shown that the force on the top,
contributed by one elemental dipole, is proportional to the magnetic ﬁeld Bd that would be produced
at (r, θ) by a quadruple located at z = h. To make this force maximal we assign to each point (r, θ)
in z < 0, a magnetization density M(r) whose magnitude is M0 and whose direction is antiparallel to
the ﬁeld line of Bd at that point. The magnetization density so deﬁned will maximize the force on the
top, and is therefore the requested answer. Mathematically, this procedure amounts to replacing M(r)

is the characteristic length in our problem which will reappear in the next sections. The value of l0
may be interpreted as the distance between two colinear dipoles, one of them is of strength µ while
the other is of strength M0l3

0, for which the mutual force between them is mg.
Eq.(11) shows that even though the magnetization direction is allowed to vary everywhere inside
the base, the levitation height h is bounded. Eq.(11) presents the maximum height that can be
accomplished with a given substance provided that the top is not allowed to move laterally. Clearly, it
also serve as an upper bound for hm, as stability was not considered yet. Moreover, note that we have
calculated the maximum magnetic force, which is proportional to ∂Bz/∂z. The magnetic ﬁeld Bz|z=h
on the other hand, becomes inﬁnite at z = h, as can be seen by the following simple argument: Since
each elemental dipole within the plate contributes a ﬁeld that goes as 1/r3 and since the volume of
integration goes as r2, the integrand goes as 1/r, for which the integral diverges as r
. Later we
show that the divergence of Bz|z=h implies that the top cannot be stable when placed in such a point.
In any case, it would be impossible to spin the top.

C. Uniformly magnetized, inﬁnite base.

Uniformly magnetized plates are clearly easier to construct. In this section we ﬁnd out what upper
bound does this restriction sets on the highest levitation point. In another sense, the result of this
section may also be considered as a lower bound on the height of levitation (for a top which is guided!),
provided one considers all possible base conﬁgurations.

We again consider an inﬁnitesimal volume element within the base. It is now oriented along the
z-direction and interacting with the top’s magnetic dipole. If this element is exactly below the top
(i.e. it is located somewhere on the negative z-axis), it exerts a repelling z-directed force on the top,
pushing it away. If the element is not exactly below the top then the nature of this force (i.e. weather
it is repulsive or attractive) is determined by the angle formed between the direction of the two dipoles
(in this case both point in the z-direction), and the direction deﬁned by the line joining these dipoles.
We call this angle θ, and measure it with respect to the positive z-direction, as is shown in Fig.1.

There exists a critical angle θ0 (see Fig.(2)), for which the z-directed force vanishes such that for
π/2 < θ < θ0 the force becomes attractive. It is therefore useless to put any material within the region
θ0) < θ < 3π/2 since this would reduce the magnetic force and decrease the
π/2 < θ < θ0 and (2π
levitation height.

−

To ﬁnd θ0 we eliminate the z-component of Eq.(8), and ﬁnd the value of θ for which it vanishes. We

pick the value of θ that lies between π/2 and π. This gives

We now evaluate the upward force exerted on the top, by summing the contributions of all the

D. Arbitrarily magnetized, ﬁnite base.

Under a given volume V0, we ﬁnd the optimum shape and magnetization of the base, that will
maximize the levitation height. We use the Lagrange’s multipliers method to treat this variational
problem [13].

First, we parametrize the shape of the plate: Let re(θ) be the upper integration radius, as is shown in
h/ cos θ. Utilizing the cylindrical symmetry of the problem,

The asymptotic behavior of h as V0 →

is valid only if (h/l0)3

is shown in Fig.(4).

The magnetic ﬁeld outside the cylinder is essentially the ﬁeld outside a solenoid with similar dimen-

sions. Thus, the z-component of the magnetic ﬁeld along the z-axis is given by[14]:

For the spinning top to be stable against translations, both kz and kρ should be positive. Comparing
kz/2, and therefore one of the pair (kz,kρ)
, then kρ → −
Eq.(27) to Eq.(26), we see that when Bz → ∞
must be negative. Thus, when the magnetic ﬁeld diverges at a point, a top placed at that point cannot
be stable. This proves that the highest hovering height, found in Section (II-B), is not under stable
conditions.

The restriction that both kz and kρ should be positive deﬁnes a stable region along the z axis. As
an example it can be shown [9], that for a base in the shape of a thin disk of radius Rd, the value of kz
is positive whenever z > Rd/2, whereas kρ is positive for z <
2/5Rd. The region of stability in this

case is therefore Rd/2 < z <
2/7Rd. We call this point the isotropically stable point because
In the case of the disk it is zi =
p
the restoring (stabilizing) force which acts on a top, which is tuned to hover at h = zi is isotropic,
depending only on the deviation from the equilibrium position and not on its direction.

p

For a general cylinder we now consider two distinct situations: The ﬁrst is the one in which the
stable point is isotropic, i.e. a hovering height h for which kρ = kz. The second is the case where h is
at the verge of stability in the lateral direction. This is also the highest stable point, characterized by
kρ = 0. Using Eqs.(26),(27) we write each of the two distinct conditions as

where a = 6 for the ﬁrst situation and a = 2 for the second.

Substituting Eq.(25) into Eq.(28) deﬁnes a functional relationship between h/R and d/R denoted

by the function G(),

these are hmax ≃
largest height that can be achieved, which is reminiscent of our conclusion of Sec.(II-C). If the given
volume is larger than Vopt however, we can always use only an amount of volume equal to Vopt and
discard the rest of the material. Hence, in principal at least, one can realize the largest possible height,
which is why the plots of h vs. V0 had been artiﬁcially corrected by assigning the maximum value of
h for the values of V0 that are larger than Vopt.

G. Inﬁnite,arbitrarily magnetized base and stability.

In this last section we consider the case of an inﬁnite base, which may be arbitrarily magnetized,
such that the height of levitation is maximized, yet the top is stable against both axial and lateral
translations. In order to solve this problem, one needs to maximize the magnetic force ∂Bz/∂z under
the constraints that kz and kρ, deﬁned in Eqs.(26) and (27) respectively, are both positive. The last
requirement however, results in a non-linear inequality, which cannot be solved analytically. The
∂2Bz/∂z2 = 0 instead, which marks the lower end
method we take here is to use the constraint kz ∝
of the stability region along the z-axis.

Consider an inﬁnitesimal magnetic dipole at the point (r, θ) within the base with magnetization M0.
It is situated below the expected hovering position, as is shown in Fig.(5), and its direction makes an
angle α(r, θ) with the line joining the dipole to the equilibrium position of the top.

Fig. 5
The magnetization density at point (r, θ) is M0 and its direction makes an angle α (r, θ) with the unit
vector ˆr. The angle distribution-α (r, θ) is chosen so as to maximize the levitation height while
maintaining the translational stability of the top.

Note that, though the gradient of the ﬁeld is ﬁnite, the ﬁeld itself diverges, and hence kρ =

kz/2.
As kz = 0 in the case we studied here, we conclude that kρ also vanishes. Thus, the lowest stable
hovering height and the highest one coincide, leaving no range of stability. A small relaxation in the
conditions however, such as limiting the volume of the material to a ﬁnite, though very large value,
results in a formation of a ﬁnite albeit small, range of stability.

III. Discussion.

We showed that the maximum levitation height of the U-CAS is bounded and is given in terms of
a characteristic length l0, which depends on the properties of the substance that the base and the top

are made of. Note also, that µ/m = M top

magnetization density. Since M0 ≃

to the energy product [16] via (BH)max ≃

r /4µ0, we may also write l0 as

(37)

In this form, l0 can be easily estimated from the knowledge of the energy product of the material.
The best candidates for large hovering heights are the Nd-Fe-B magnets. An example of which is
Vacuumschmelze’s VACODYM 344 HR [17], whose remanence (Br) is 13.5 KGauss and whose density
is 7.5 gr/cm3. For this magnet, the magnetization is M = Br/4π = 1070 emu/cm3. Thus, with
g = 980 cm/sec2, we ﬁnd that l0 ≃
1.6 meter. This gives, according to Eq.(36), a maximum stable
hovering height of about 13 meters!. Typical values of the energy product, density and corresponding
l0, for modern commercial magnets available today are listed in Table I.

According to Eq.(37) the characteristic length is proportional to the energy product. Therefore,
the larger the energy product is, the larger l0 will be. A question is then asked: what is the highest
conceivable energy product? This question has been already discussed by Strnat [18], according to
which “ ...it seems reasonable to assume that the best room-temperature energy products will never

material.

Table II summarizes the upper and lower bounds for the maximum hovering height under a selected

number of constraints.

18

It is important to note, that in the above derivation we assumed that the magnetization vector
M(r, θ) is independent of the ﬁeld. Though this is a very good approximation for modern permanent
magnets like rare-earth magnets, its only an approximation even for these. Furthermore, the maximum
ﬁeld at the top is limited by its mechanical and magnetic strength: Stability considerations show [21]
I1) where
that the spinning speed of the top while hovering must be greater than
I3 and I1 are the moments of inertia along the principal and secondary axes, respectively. Also, the
maximum ﬁeld at the top is limited by its coercivity as the ﬁeld is opposite to the magnetization.
Thus, in practice, Eq.(36) should be considered as an upper bound for the maximum hovering height
of the U-CAS.

µ Bz|z=h /(I3 −

p

Yet another way to increase the hovering height of the top is to use current coil for the base, instead
of a permanent magnet [7]. The advantage of the coil over the magnetic plate is in the fact that one
can raise the top to the levitation point by electrical means instead of raising the top mechanically,
as in the permanent magnet case. Here, the hovering height is not limited directly by the strength of
the magnetic ﬁeld, but rather by the amount of power that one can deliver into the coil to overcome
electrical resistance. One might argue that the use of superconducting wires for the coil should lift
this constraint, but the hovering height is bounded in this case as well, for if the ﬁeld increases beyond
a critical value, the superconductor goes into its normal phase. We have shown [7], that for a given
height of levitation h, the minimum power required for levitation is given by

Fig. 6
Bounds on the maximum levitation height Vs. volume for: Best magnetization possible (dash-dot
line), Best uniform magnetization (dotted line), Uniformly magnetized cylinder with highest stable
point (dashed line), Uniformly magnetized cylinder with isotropic stable point (solid line) and
small volume limit (dash-dot-dot line). The two curves that correspond to the uniformly
magnetized cylinder has been artificially corrected by extending the highest levitation point to
higher volumes.

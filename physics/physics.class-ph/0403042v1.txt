Abstract: The genesis of the Post constraint is premised on two attributes of modern electro-
magnetism: (i) its microscopic nature, and (ii) the status of ˜e (x, t) and ˜b (x, t) as the primitive
electromagnetic ﬁelds. This constraint can therefore not arise in EH–electromagnetism, wherein
the primitive electromagnetic ﬁelds are the macroscopic ﬁelds ˜E (x, t) and ˜H (x, t). Available
experimental evidence against the Post constraint is incomplete and inconclusive.

Introduction

Ever since its enunciation in 1962 [1], the Post constraint has been an enigma. It was ignored
for over three decades by the electromagnetics community for reasons that will probably be
extracted only by future historians of science. It arose from obscurity like a phoenix in 1994
in the context of linear, nonreciprocal, biisotropic mediums [2], and since then has been the
subject of discussion in the complex–mediums electromagnetics research community.

A remarkable feature of the Post constraint is that it permits a sharp distinction between
two widely prevalent conceptions of electromagnetic phenomenons. The genesis of the Post
constraint lies in the microphysical basis of modern electromagnetism, whereby the (necessarily
macroscopic) constitutive functions must be conceived as piecewise homogeneous entities and
can therefore not vary continuously in spacetime. In contrast, EH–electromagnetism is essen-
tially macroscopic, and its principles seem to be inimical to the validity of the Post constraint.
Available experimental evidence does not negate the Post constraint, but cannot be held to be
conclusive either.

These issues are discussed in this essay. Section 2 is an exposition of modern electromagnetism
encompassing both the microscopic and the macroscopic levels. Section 3 presents the rationale
for and the genesis of the Post constraint. The characteristics of EH–electromagnetism relevant
to the Post constraint are given in Section 4, while experimental evidence is reviewed in Section
5. Finally, in Section 6 the constitutive equations of free space are deduced in relation to the
Post constraint.

2 Modern Electromagnetism

Electromagnetism today is a microscopic science, even though it is mostly used in its macro-
It was certainly a macroscopic science when Maxwell uniﬁed the equations of
scopic form.
Coulomb, Gauss, Faraday, and Amp`ere, added a displacement current to Amp`ere’s equation,
and produced the four equations to which his name is attached. Although Maxwell had aban-
doned a mechanical basis for electromagnetism during the early 1860s, and even used terms
like molecular vortices, a close reading [3] of his papers will convince the reader that Maxwell’s
conception of electromagnetism — like that of most of his contemporaries — was macroscopic.

By the end of the 19th century, that conception had been drastically altered [4]. Hall’s
successful explanation of the eponymous eﬀect, the postulation of the electron by Stoney and
its subsequent discovery by Thomson, and Larmor’s theory of the electron precipitated that
alteration. It was soon codiﬁed by Lorentz and Heaviside, so that the 20th century dawned with
the acquisition of a microphysical basis by electromagnetism. Maxwell’s equations remained
unaltered in form at macroscopic length scales, but their roots now lie in the ﬁelds engendered
by microscopic charge quantums. The subsequent emergence of quantum mechanics did not
change the form of the macroscopic equations either, although the notion of a ﬁeld lost its
determinism and an inherent uncertainty was recognized in the measurements of key variables
[5].

2.1 Microscopic Maxwell Postulates

The microscopic ﬁelds are just two: the electric ﬁeld ˜e (x, t) and the magnetic ﬁeld ˜b (x, t).2
These two are accorded the status of primitive ﬁelds in modern electromagnetism. Both ﬁelds
vary extremely rapidly as functions of position x and time t. Their sources are the microscopic
charge density ˜c (x, t) and the microscopic current density ˜j (x, t), where

δ( • ) is the Dirac delta function; while xℓ(t) and vℓ(t) are the position and the velocity of the
point charge qℓ. Uncertainties in the measurements of the positions and the velocities of the
discrete point charges open the door to quantum mechanics, but we need not traverse that path
here.

All of the foregoing ﬁelds and sources appear in the microscopic Maxwell postulates:

˜c (x, t) =

˜j (x, t) =

2.2 Macroscopic Maxwell Postulates

Macroscopic measuring devices average over (relatively) large spatial and temporal intervals.
Therefore, spatiotemporal averaging of the microscopic quantities appears necessary in order
to deduce the macroscopic Maxwell postulates from (3)–(6). Actually, only spatial averaging is
necessary [6], because it implies temporal averaging due to the ﬁnite magnitude of the universal
−1/2. Denoting the macroscopic charge and current densities, respectively,
maximum speed (ǫ0µ0)
by ˜ρ (x, t) and ˜J (x, t), we obtain the macroscopic Maxwell postulates

which involve the macroscopic primitive ﬁelds ˜E (x, t) and ˜B (x, t) as the spatial averages of
˜e (x, t) and ˜b (x, t), respectively. From (7) and (8), a macroscopic continuity equation for the
source densities can be derived as

2.3 Familiar Form of Macroscopic Maxwell Postulates

Equations (7)–(10) are not the familiar form of the macroscopic Maxwell postulates, even though
they hold in free space as well as in matter. The familiar form emerges after the recognition
that matter contains, in general, both free charges and bound charges. Free and bound source
densities can be decomposed as

and

˜ρ (x, t) = ˜ρso (x, t)

˜J (x, t) = ˜J so (x, t) +

˜P (x, t) +

˜M (x, t) .

This decomposition is consistent with (11), provided the free source densities obey the reduced
continuity equation

The free source densities represent “true” sources which can be externally impressed. Whereas
˜J so (x, t) is the source current density, ˜ρso (x, t) is the source charge density.

˜ρso (x, t) = 0 .

Bound source densities represent matter in its macroscopic form and are, in turn, quantiﬁed
by the polarization ˜P (x, t) and the magnetization ˜M (x, t). Both ˜P (x, t) and ˜M (x, t) are
˜A (x, t) and ˜M (x, t) +
nonunique to the extent that they can be replaced by ˜P (x, t)
(∂/∂t) ˜A (x, t), respectively, in (12) and (13) without aﬀecting the left sides of either equation.

Polarization and magnetization are subsumed in the deﬁnitions of the electric induction

˜D (x, t) and the magnetic induction ˜H (x, t) as follows:

Then, (7)–(10) metamorphose into the familiar form of the macroscopic Maxwell postulates:

Let us note, in passing, that the ﬁelds ˜d (x, t) and ˜h (x, t) do not exist in microphysics, matter

being an ensemble of point charges in free space.

2.4 Linear Constitutive Relations

The induction ﬁelds at some point in spacetime (x, t) can depend locally on the primitive ﬁelds
at the same (x, t). This dependence can be spatially nonhomogeneous (i.e., dependent on space
x) and/or can vary with time t (i.e., age). In addition, the induction ﬁelds at (x, t) can depend
th), where the spacetime interval (xh, th),
nonlocally on the primitive ﬁelds at some (x
0, must be timelike in order to be causally inﬂuential [7, pp. 85–89]. Thus, the most

3 The Post Constraint

Four second–rank tensors appear in the foregoing constitutive relations: ˜ǫ is the permittivity
tensor, ˜ν is the impermeability tensor, while ˜ξ and ˜ζ are the magnetoelectric tensors. Together,
these four tensors contain 36 scalar functions; but the Post constraint indicates that only 35, at
most, are independent. This was clariﬁed elsewhere [9] using 4–tensor notation, but we revisit
the issue here for completeness. Let us therefore express the magnetoelectric tensors as

˜ξ(x, t; xh, th) = ˜α(x, t; xh, th) +

I ˜Ψ(x, t; xh, th)

and

where I is the identity tensor and the scalar function

3.1 Rationale for the Post Constraint

Let us recall that (19) and (20) do not contain the induction ﬁelds ˜D (x, t) and ˜H (x, t). Hence,
(21) and (22) must be substituted only in (17) and (18); thus,

The second integral on the left side of (27) is null–valued by virtue of (19); likewise, the third
integral on the left side of (28) is null–valued by virtue of (20). Therefore, the four macroscopic

Diﬀerentiation of the product of two functions is distributive. Hence, the thirty–ﬁve inde-
pendent constitutive scalars in ˜ǫ, ˜α, ˜β and ˜ν occur in (29)–(32) in two ways: (i) by themselves,
and (ii) through their space– and time–derivatives. In contrast, the thirty–sixth constitutive
scalar ˜Ψ does not occur in (29)–(32) by itself. Thus, ˜Ψ vanished from the macroscopic Maxwell
postulates like the Cheshire cat, but left behind its derivatives like the cat’s grin.

This is an anomalous situation, and its elimination leads to the Post constraint.

3.2 Post’s Conclusions

In a seminal contribution on the covariant structure of modern electromagnetism [1], Post made
a distinction between functional and structural ﬁelds. Functional ﬁelds specify the state of a
medium, and are exempliﬁed by ˜E and ˜B. Structural ﬁelds, exempliﬁed by the constitutive
tensors, specify the properties of the medium. Formulating the Lagrangian and examining its
Eulerian derivative [1, Eq. 5.31], Post arrived at the conclusion that

even for nonhomogeneous mediums [1, p. 130]. Furthermore, he held that the space– and
time–derivatives of ˜Ψ(x, t; xh, th) are also identically zero, so that [1, p. 129]

(33)

(34)

Equations (33) and (34) may appear to be independent but are not, because the derivatives

of a constant function are zero. Equation (33) alone is called the Post constraint.

3.3 Recognizable Existence of ˜Ψ

Whether ˜Ψ is identically null–valued or not is a moot point. The real issue is whether it has a
recognizable existence or not. This stance was adopted by Lakhtakia and Weiglhofer [10].

Let us recall that all matter is microscopic. Despite the convenience proﬀered by continuum
theories, those theories are merely approximations. Constitutive functions are macroscopic
entities arising from the homogenization of assemblies of microscopic charge carriers, with free
space serving as the reference medium [11]. In any small enough portion of spacetime that is
homogenizable, the constitutive functions are uniform. When such a portion will be interrogated
for characterization, it will have to be embedded in free space. Accordingly, the second integral
on the left side of (29) as well as the third as well as the fourth integrals on the left side of (30)
would vanish during the interrogation for ﬁelds inside and outside that piece. Therefore, the
principle of parsimony (attributed to a 14th century monk [12]) enjoins the acceptance of (33).

3.4 Nature of the Post Constraint

When linear mediums of increasing complexity are investigated, the nature of thePost constraint
can appear to vary. For instance, were investigation conﬁned to isotropic mediums [13], the

7

condition ˜Ψ
any transpose–symmetry requirements on ˜ǫ, ˜α, ˜β and ˜ν [14, Eqs. 23].

0 can resemble a reciprocity constraint. But it is not, because it does not impose

≡

Another possibility is to think that the Post constraint negates the generalized duality trans-
formation [15], but actually it does not when it is globally applied at the microscopic level [16,
pp. 203–204]. Finally, the Post constraint is not a gauge transformation — i.e., a ˜Ψ–independent
ﬁeld ˜A cannot be found to replace ˜P and ˜M by ˜P
˜A and ˜M + (∂/∂t) ˜A, respectively, in
order to eliminate ˜Ψ.

− ∇ ×

The Post constraint is actually a structural constraint. Post may have been inspired towards
it in order to eliminate a pathological constitutive relation [1, Eq. 3.20], [17], and then estab-
lished a covariance argument for it. Physically, this constraint arises from the following two
considerations:

•

•

The Amp`ere–Maxwell equation (containing the induction ﬁelds) should be independent
of the Faraday equation (containing the primitive ﬁelds) at the macroscopic level, just as
the two equations are mutually independent at the microscopic level.

The constitutive functions must be characterized as piecewise uniform, being born of the
spatial homogenization of microscopic entities. Therefore, if a homogeneous piece of a
medium with a certain set of electromagnetic response properties cannot be recognized,
the assumption of continuously nonhomogeneous analogs of that set is untenable.

4 EH–Electromagnetism

Time–domain electromagnetic research is a distant second to frequency–domain electromagnetic
research, as measured by the numbers of publications as well as the numbers of researchers.
Much of frequency–domain research at the macroscopic level also commences with the familar
form (17)–(20) of the Maxwell postulates, but the roles of ˜H and ˜B are interchanged [11].

Thus, constitutive relations are written to express ˜D and ˜B in terms of ˜E and ˜H. Speciﬁcally,

the linear constitutive relations (21) and (22) are replaced by

as the constitutive tensors. This version of electromagnetism is called the

8

At ﬁrst glance, the diﬀerence between the modern and the EH versions may not appear to
be signiﬁcant, particularly for linear mediums at the macroscopic level. The frequency–domain
versions of the constitutive tensors ˜
, etc., can also be microscopically motivated in much the
A
same way as the frequency–domain versions of ˜ǫ, etc., are. Yet, there is a huge diﬀerence: The
Faraday equation contains only the primitive ﬁelds while the Amp`ere–Maxwell equation contains
only the induction ﬁelds, in modern electromagnetism, and can therefore be independent of each
other just as at the microscopic level. But each of the two equations contains a primitive ﬁeld
and an induction ﬁeld in EH–electromagnetism — hence, it is impossible for the two equations
to be independent of each other at the macroscopic level. This central diﬀerence between the
two versions of electromagnetism is often a source of great confusion.

4.1 Post Constraint

As both the Faraday and the Amp`ere–Maxwell equations (at the macroscopic level) contain a
primitive ﬁeld and an induction ﬁeld in EH–electromagnetism, it appears impossible to derive
the Post constraint in the EH version. Not surprisingly, current opposition to the validity of the
Post constraint invariably employs the EH version [15, 18], and older constructs that presumably
invalidate the Post constraint are also based on EH–electromagnetism [19, 20, 21]. The major
exception to the previous statement is the work of O’Dell [22, pp. 38–44], but it is fatally
marred by the assumption of purely instantaneous — and, therefore, noncausal — constitutive
relations. Simply put, the Post constraint is valid in modern electromagnetism but probably
invalid in EH–electromagnetism.

But we hold modern electromagnetism to be truer than its EH counterpart [6, 23, 24, 25].
Accordingly, the Post constraint can translated from the former to the latter, in certain cir-
cumstances. For example, let us consider a spatially homogeneous, temporally invariant and
spatially local medium: ˜ǫ(x, t; xh, th)
˜ǫ(th) δ(xh), etc. Employing the temporal Fourier trans-
form3

where ω is the angular frequency and i = √

1, we see that (21) and (22) transform to

5 Experimental Evidence

Fundamental questions are answered by a convergence of theoretical constructs and diverse
experimental evidence. On this basis, modern electromagnetism is well–established, which
provides conﬁdence in the validity of the Post constraint. Furthermore, incontrovertible ex-
perimental results against the Post constraint are unknown. Nevertheless, the constraint is
experimentally falsiﬁable, and available experimental evidence presented against it must not be
dismissed lightly. Let us examine that evidence now.

5.1 Magnetoelectric Materials

Anisotropic materials with magnetoelectric tensors are commonplace. Typically, such properties
are exhibited at low frequencies and low temperatures. Although their emergence in research
literature can be traced back to Pierre Curie [27], a paper published originally in 1959 [20]
focused attention on them. O’Dell wrote a famous book on these materials [22] in 1970.

A signiﬁcant result of O’Dell [22, Eq. 2.64], although derived for spatiotemporally uniform
and spatiotemporally local mediums (i.e., ˜ǫ(x, t; xh, th) = ˜ǫ δ(xh) δ(th), etc.), is often used in
frequency–domain literature on spatiotemporally uniform and spatially local mediums as follows:

= 0. More importantly, this
This equation is often held to allow materials for which Ψ(ω)
equation is widely used in the magnetoelectric research community to reduce experimental
tedium in characterizing magnetoelectric materials. Yet this equation is based on a false premise:
that materials (as distinct from free space) respond purely instantaneously [22, p. 43]. Hence,
experimental data obtained after exploiting (43) cannot be trusted [28].

The false premise can be traced back to Dzyaloshinski˘i’s 1959 paper [20], wherein EH–
(ω) of Cr2O3 with tem-
electromagnetism was used. Astrov [29] examined the variation of
perature at 10 kHz frequency. Folen et al.
(ω) of Cr2O3 at 1 kHz frequency
(ω) by virtue of the 1959 antecedent [31], but did not actually
and presumably equated it to
measure
(ω) for the
same substance, and they also established that both quantities are temperature–dependent,
(ω). Similar deﬁciencies in other published reports have been
but they too did not measure
detailed elsewhere [28]. Recently, Raab [34] has rightly called for comprehensive and complete
characterization of magnetoelectric materials, with (43) not assumed in advance but actually
subjected to a test.

5.2 Tellegen Medium

Take a ﬂuid medium in which permanent, orientable, electric dipoles exist in abundance. Stir
in small ferromagnetic particles with permanent magnetic dipole moments, ensuring that each
electric dipole moment cleaves together with a parallel magnetic dipole moment, to form a
Tellegen particle [18]. Shake well for a homogeneous, isotropic suspension of Tellegen particles.
This is the recipe that Tellegen [19] gave for the so–called Tellegen medium, after he had
conceptualized the gyrator.

The frequency–domain constitutive relations of this medium may be set down as

D (x, ω) =
B (x, ω) =

(ω) E (x, ω) +
(ω) E (x, ω) +

(ω) H (x, ω)
(ω) H (x, ω)

(44)

with the assumption of temporal invariance, spatial homogeneity, spatial locality, and isotropy.
Furthermore, (44) apply only at suﬃciently low frequencies [35].

Gyrators have been approximately realized using other circuit elements, but the Tellegen
medium has never been successfully synthesized. Tellegen’s own experiments failed [19, p. 96]
Neither has the Tellegen medium been observed in nature. Hence, non–zero values of
(ω)
of actual materials are not known. A fairly elementary exercise shows that the recognizable
existence of this medium is tied to that of irreducible magnetic sources [36, 37]. As the prospects
of observing a magnetic monopole are rather remote [38, 39], for now it is appropriate to regard
the Tellegen medium as chimerical.

5.3 Tellegen Particle

Each particle in Tellegen’s recipe is actually a uniaxial particle [40]. Because the recipe calls
for the suspension to be homogeneous, the particles cannot be similarly oriented. However, if
all particles were similarly oriented in free space, and the number density Np of the particles
is very small, the frequency–domain constitutive relations of the suspension at suﬃciently low
frequencies will be

wherein π(ee), etc., are the polarizability tensors of a Tellegen particle in free space.

A recent report [18] provides experimental evidence on the existence of π(eh) for a Tellegen
particle made by sticking a short copper wire to a ferrite sphere biased by a quasistatic magnetic
ﬁeld parallel to the wire. However, this work can not lead to any signiﬁcant ﬁnding against the
validity of the Post constraint for the following two reasons:

•

Although a quantity proportional to the magnitude of Trace
measurement of Trace

was assumed without testing. This deﬁciency in experimentation is similar to that for
magnetoelectric materials mentioned in Section 5.1.

•

The Post constraint is supposed to hold rigorously for linear electromagnetic response
with respect to the total electromagnetic ﬁeld, which is constituted jointly by the bias
magnetic ﬁeld as well as the time–harmonic electromagnetic ﬁeld. As discussed by Chen
[41], the ferrite is therefore a nonlinear material.

Incidentally, the biased–ferrite–metal–wire modality for Tellegen particles is likely to be very
diﬃcult to implement to realize the Tellegen medium of Section 5.2.

5.4 Summation of Experimental Evidence

On reviewing Sections 5.1–5.3, it becomes clear that experimental evidence against the validity
of the Post constraint is incomplete and inconclusive, in addition to being based either on the
false premise of purely instantaneous response and/or derived from EH–electromagnetism.

6 Post Constraint and Free Space

Although the Post constraint holds for modern electromagnetism, which has a microscopic basis
in that matter is viewed as an assembly of charge–carriers in free space, before concluding this
essay it is instructive to derive the constitutive equations of free space back from the macroscopic
constitutive equations (21) and (22).

Let us begin with free space being spatiotemporally invariant and spatiotemporally local;
δ(xh) δ(th), etc., and (21) and (22) simplify to

then, ˜ǫ(x, t; xh, th) = ˜ǫ

f s

˜D (x, t) = ˜ǫ
˜H (x, t) = ˜ζ

f s

• ˜E (x, t) + ˜ξ
f s
• ˜E (x, t) + ˜ν

f s

• ˜B (x, t)
• ˜B (x, t) 


.

f s

(47)

(49)

The free energy being a perfect diﬀerential, and because the constitutive relations (47) do not
involve convolution integrals, it follows that [1, Eq. 6.14]

(cid:1)
With the additional requirement of isotropy, we get

(cid:0)
˜D (x, t) = ˜ǫf s ˜E (x, t) + ˜ξf s ˜B (x, t)
˜H (x, t) =

˜ξf s ˜E (x, t) + ˜νf s ˜B (x, t)

−

.

(cid:27)

The subsequent imposition of the Post constraint means that ξf s = 0, and the constitutive
relations

˜D (x, t) = ˜ǫf s ˜E (x, t)
˜H (x, t) = ˜νf s ˜B (x, t)
ﬁnally emerge. The values ˜ǫf s = ǫ0 and ˜νf s = 1/µ0 are used in SI [25]. Although Lorentz–
reciprocity was not explicitly enforced for free space, it emerges naturally in this exercise [42].
Alternatively, it could have been enforced from the very beginning, and it would have led to
˜ξf s = 0 [43].

7 Concluding Remarks

Despite the fact that the mathematical forms of the macroscopic Maxwell postulates are identical
in modern electromagnetism as well as in EH–electromagnetism, the two are very physically very
diﬀerent. Modern electromagnetism is held to be basic; hence, the answers to all fundamental
questions must be decided within its framework. Thereafter, if necessary, its equations can be
transformed into the frequency domain and then into those of EH–electromagnetism — and
the resulting equations may be used to solve any problems that a researcher may be interested
in. The reverse transition from EH–electromagnetism to modern electromagnetism can lead to
false propositions.

COMMENT ON “DO ZERO-ENERGY SOLUIIONS OF
MAXWELL EQUATIONS HAVE THE PHYSICAL ORI-
GIN SUGGESTED BY A. E. CHUBYKALO?” BY V.V.
DVOEGLAZOV

Key words: electromagnetic ﬁeld energy.

Dvoeglazov’s paper is not trivial because we know the classical def-
inition of any non-trivial truth: a truth is not trivial if and only if
an opposite statement is not false (and vice versa, of course). So I
strongly recommend his paper for a reader.

But I have a few notes:
1) V. Dvoeglazov writes in his footnote number 7: ”In my opin-
ion, equations (20,21) of ref. [1] are just another form of the Maxwell
equations for this particular case, in the sense that there is no new
physical content if one expects that the Maxwell electrodynamics
describes also the Coulomb interaction.”

The point is that precisely this (“another”) form of the Maxwell
equations (namely with total derivatives!) allows us to describe
the Coulomb interaction as an action-at-a-distance (it was shown
in [2]).
It is well-known that generally accepted Maxwell equa-
tions (with partial derivatives only) describe just transverse1 elec-
tromagnetic waves in vacuum which spread with a limited velocity

1“transverse” in this case means that vectors E and B are per-

pendicular with respect to wave vector k in every point.

(i.e. they describe so called short-range interaction only). That is
why there is new physical content2 in Eqs. (18-21) [1]. Note also
that V. Dvoeglazov here erroneously mentioned just Eqs. (20,21).
The point is that Eqs. (20,21) describe exclusively instantaneous
(action-at-a-distance) interaction while the whole system of our
equations (18-21) (Eqs. (1-4) in this Comment) describe both in-
stantaneous and short-range. These equations are written as two
uncoupled pairs of diﬀerential equations:

and

r is the ﬁxed point of observation, rq is the point of the location of
a moving charge q at the instant t, the total time derivative of any
vector ﬁeld value E (or H) can be calculated by the following rule:

2I should to note here that a considerable number of papers have
recently been published which declare (prove?) an existence of
so called longitudinal electromagnetic waves in vacuum but these
ideas still are not generally accepted in classical electrodynamics
(see, e.g., review [3]).

here Vi are velocities of the particles at the same moment of time
of observation.3

2) V. Dvoeglazov’s phrase: ”The main problem with the Chuby-
kalo derivation is the following: the integrals are divergent when
they extend over all the space.
... But, to the best of my knowl-
edge, some persons claimed that such procedures do not have sound
mathematical foundation.”

I do not see any mathematical prohibition to use such procedures.
See, e.g., [4] (Vol. 2, ch. 17, §1, point 282). Fihtengoltz here
considers the following deﬁnition of the integral with inﬁnite limits:

∞

Za

f (x)dx = lim
A→∞

A

Za

f (x)dx.

(10)

If this limit (rhs 10) does not exist or(attention!) is inﬁnite, they
say that this integral diverges. But then Fihtengoltz adds, however,
that in the case when the limit (rhs 10) exists and it is equal to
inﬁnity one can consider the inﬁnite limit (rhs 10) as a value of the
integral (lhs 10).

V. Dvoeglazov asks: ”Furthermore, even if one accepts its va-
lidity the total energy resulting from integration of (28) over the
whole space is to be inﬁnite!?”4

Why not? Many years ago, in Newton’s times, for example,
nobody (I mean, physicists) doubted that the Universe had an in-
ﬁnite number of stars. It meant that the mass of the Universe was
̺dV over the inﬁnite vol-

inﬁnite. And this mass is no more than R∞

ume, where ̺ is a limited mass density of the Universe. Now many
physicists believe that the mass (and, of course, the total energy) of
our Universe is limited but their statements have no any evidence
(however the statement that the Universe has an inﬁnite mass also
has no evidence). Unfortunately, it is still a matter of the belief.

At last V. Dvoeglazov cites: ”It was noted by Barut [5, p.105]
that in the case of non-vanishing ﬁelds at the spatial inﬁnity ‘we
cannot expect to ﬁnd globally conserved quantities’.”

I have only one question here: Is it possible experimentally to

ﬁnd globally conserved quantities?

3) The ﬁnal phrase of V. Dvoeglazov’s paper is: ”... we are not
yet convinced in the necessity of correction of the formula for the
3Note (see [2]) that unlike the ﬁelds {}∗ the ﬁelds {}0 do not

retard.

w =

energy density for radiation ﬁeld because of the absence of ﬁrm
experimental and mathematical bases in [1].”

In turn, I explained in this short comment that if we suppose
that the radiation ﬁeld exists in inﬁnity (mathematically it is pos-
sible, see above, on the other hand the opposite statement has no
evidences) we must correct the formula of the energy density for
the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

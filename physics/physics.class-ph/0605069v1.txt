Poincar´e’s relativistic Doppler-Fizeau formula

Dr. Yves Pierseaux
ULB ypiersea@ulb.ac.be

February 2, 2008

Abstract

We deduce from Poincar´e’s ellipsoidal wavefronts a relativistic Doppler-Fizeau formula that is not the same
as 1905 Einstein’s one. Longitudinally, Einstein’s formula and Poincar´e’s formula are the same. Both formulas
are compatible with relativistic time dilation. The question of an experimental test is directly connected with
the possibility or the impossibility of directly measuring the transverse Doppler eﬀect. Hasselkamp’s exper-
iment (1978) becomes a crucial experiment because Poincar´e’s relativistic kinematics predicts an expansion
of space directly connected with the Doppler-Fizeau eﬀect for the remote objects.

1 Lorentz transformation and Poincar´e’s elliptical wavefront

Let us consider a couple of inertial systems K and K’ in uniform translation relative one another. A source of
light is at rest O in K. What is the image by LT in K’, of a circular wavefront in K, emitted in t′ = t = 0 by this
source S? Poincar´e writes LT with perfectly spacetime symmetry (in x and t) [Poincar´e H. 1905]:

′
x

= k(x + εt)

′

t

= k(t + εx)

Poincar´e’s notations where ε, k correspond to Einstein-Planck’s notations β, γ given that, according to Poincar´e
in his 1905 work about the theory of relativity, ”I shall choose the units of length and of time in such a way that
the velocity of light is equal to unity”[Pierseaux Y (2004)]. For the easiness of present reader we adopt standard
notations β, γ but we keep Poincar´e’s spacetime units c = 1”:

The object time t = t0 is ﬁxed in K (circular wavefront in K) but image time t’

the Cartesian equation of an elongated ellipse in K’`ethe observer O’ is at the focus, ﬁgure 1). Poincar´e’s ellipse
is engraved in LT and its physical meaning is the relativity of simultaneity: two simultaneous events (diﬀerent
abscissa) in K are not simultaneous in K’ [Moreau W.] & [Pierseaux Y.(ellipse)]:

1If according to Einstein, the object (ﬁxed time t) and the image (ﬁxed time t’), are both spherical within the two systems,
then two simultaneous events in K must be always also simultaneous in K’. [Einstein A.(1905), paragraphe 3]). This is Einstein’s
convention of synchronisation in spherical waves (∆t = ∆t′ = 0)[Pierseaux Y.(ellipse)].

What is a wavefront in a relativistic sense (a ”spacetime” wavefront)? The invariant interval between the
event ”emission” (t = t′ = 0) and any event on the wavefront (t = t0, r = r0 in K and t′, r′ in K’) is null within
both systems. So Minkowski’s spacetime 4-vector (with null interval) is, in Poincar´e’s kinematics, a wavefront
4-vector (9). The elliptical image by LT is deduced from a non-transversal t′ section in Minkowski’s cone2.
The essential fact that Poincar´e’s ellipse is engraved in LT can be seen with the inverse LT:

Inverse elongated ellipse (14bis), with the source at the focus and the observer O’ at the centre, is Poincar´e’s
historical ellipse (1906-1912). This ellipse explains, according to Poincar´e, the null result of Michelson experiment
(the mean time back and forth is the same in any direction, see Poincar´e’s oscillator [Pierseaux Y (2004)]). Let
us however here focus the attention on the fact that the relation between t and t’ is exactly the same if we
consider the ”source at rest” (14) or the ”observer at rest”(14bis). Suppose now that the source emits a light
signal with a period of T seconds. Given that the relativistic kinematics is a classical theory, the period of the
emitted wave is also T seconds. The periodical wave that consists of a series of elliptical wavefronts received
by the observer deﬁnes the standard conﬁguration of a Doppler-Fizeau eﬀect (with the frequency ν = 1
T and
ν ′ = 1
T ′ ). In prerelativistic point of view the two cases are not symmetrical. In relativistic (elliptical) point of
view, the respective role of the source and the observer are completely interchangeable (see Poincar´e’s wavefront
4-vector). However, in order to have a rigorous deduction of a Doppler-Fizeau formula (emission in a constant
direction), we have to consider a plane wave ([Pierseaux Y.(ellipse)]).

2Poincar´e’s spacetime metrics is not the same as Einstein-Minkowski’s spacetime metrics ([Pierseaux Y (2004)]) .

2 Tangent to the ellipse, plane wave and Poincar´e’s Doppler formula

Until now we considered one only source SO which emits at t = t′ = 0 a spherical wave with ﬁxed time t = t0
(ﬁgure 1)- Let us now consider a second source S∞ at inﬁnity at rest in K in the direction θ (ﬁgure 3) which
emits a plane wavefront.

Suppose that the considered plane wavefront (here a ”wave straight line” at two space dimensions) be in O
at the time t = t′ = 0 (when SO emits a spherical wave). It will be tangent in t = t0 to the circular wavefront,
emitted by S1 (normalized t0 = r0 = 1 ﬁgure 3). We note that the simultaneous events P1T P2 in K are no
longer simultaneous (P ′
2) in K’. We deduce respectively (2) for the object front (”wave straight line” with
angular coeﬃcient a = − cot g θ) and the image front both following relations:

Exactly like the circular wavefronts (´equation 3), there are two possibilities:
If t′

is not ﬁxed (Poincar´e, spacetime image wavefront), we have by LT, t′ = γ(t + βx) = γ−1t + βx′,
and therefore the primed relation 15 is the equation of the tangent to the ellipse at the point T ′ (on which P ′

”everything happens as if β = 0”, in other words exactly as in Einstein’s synchronisation in spherical waves (5bis,
note1). Einstein considers [Einstein A.(1905), paragraphe 7] that the Galilean invariant (20) is by deﬁnition a
Lorentz invariant. Einstein’s deﬁnition of the invariance of the phase is therefore based on a 4-scalar product
between the 4-vector position (t, r) and another 4-vector with null norm (ω, k) :

Einstein’s extension of prerelativistic concept of wave 3-vector (double transversality) into a wave 4-vector
(ω, k) is a very serious problem (t′ is ﬁxed on the front but r′ is not ﬁxed) because the LT is not compatible
with the double transversality (double simultaneity).

Suppose now that the source S2 (at the inﬁnity, ﬁgure 3) emits a series of plane wavefronts (here a train of
”wave straight line”) at the same rythm as the spherical wavefronts (ν = 1
t ). Let us construct a Lorentz

invariant phase Φ on the only basis of Lorentz invariance of the interval, (t − r)(t + r) = (t′ − r′
the event t = t′ = 0 and any event on the plane front ([Pierseaux Y.(ellipse)]). With the tangency point T’ of
the front to the ellipse (image of T, ﬁgure 3) we have (t − rT )(t + rT ) = (t′ − r′

The invariance of the phase for the wavefront is no longer coupled with the (prerelativistic) ﬁxing of the time on
the wavefront in each system. We immediately deduce from (23) a relativistic Doppler-Fizeau formula:

Let us call this formula, deduced from Poincar´e’s ellipse, ”Poincar´e’s Doppler-Fizeau formula”. This is not

the same as Einstein’s one (22) because the proper angle θ is replaced with improper angle θ

de Broglie’s works). Poincar´e’s proportionality (9-26) involves that this Doppler-Fizeau formula for remote
objects (S∞) is not independant of the structure of space-time (Poincar´e’s expansion of space for remote
objects [Pierseaux Y.(ellipse)]). We showed [Pierseaux Y & Rousseaux G.] that Poincar´e’s theory of wavefront
is compatible with electromagnetic theory of waves (in particular with the transversality of the primed electric
ﬁeld to the primed direction of propagation).

3 Conclusion: Doppler formulas and experimental tests

In order to experimentally test both Doppler formulas, which are both compatible with the relativistic dilation
of time [Pierseaux Y (2004)], we need length waves (or frequencies) emitted by moving atoms with respect to the
observer (the relativistic transformation of the energy is not in question here). Mandelberg describes the SODS
(”Second Order Doppler-Shift”):

5In Einstein-Minkowski’s kinematics, the light has a double 4-vectorial repr´esentation : the Minkowski’s light like four-vector and

Einstein’s wave 4-vector. This latter is inseparable du photon d’Einstein, d´eﬁni en jauge transverse [Pierseaux Y. (2005-2)].

Let us note that, without the relativistic factor γ, we ﬁnd again both forms of classical formulas respectively

2 ) is not feasible6”. Most of
[Mandelberg H. I. & Witten L.], the measurement of transversal eﬀect ” (θ
physicists have quoted the direct observation of the transversal eﬀect to be extremely diﬃcult or even impossible.
This is the reason why most of experiments are on the Ives-Stilwell longitudinal conﬁguration. At the ﬁrst
sight it seems impossible [Falk G, Ruppel W ] to experimentally distinguish between Poincar´e’s and Einstein’s
formula. However, in 1979, Hasselkamp [Hasselkamp D. & all] introduces an experiment that directly measures
= 90◦ . He rejects the argument according to
the quadratic relativistic eﬀect in the vicinity of the angle θ
which the Doppler-broadening of the line (which is a consequence of the ﬁnite opening angle of the optical
system) could be much larger than the second order Doppler-shift). Hasselkamp speciﬁes ”the mechanical could
< 91◦. And also ”The real angle of
only be performed to an accuracy in the real observation angle 90◦ < θ
observation is 90, 5◦”. This is important for the discussion because Hasselkamp measures a redshift and if we
use the blueshift formula (29 with 90, 5◦) the quadratic eﬀect is compatible with both formulas cos θ
c :
6Let us remark that the experimental point of view deﬁned the transversality with observer angle whilst the theoretical point of
view deﬁned the transversality with the proper angle of the source. The question of the deﬁnition of transversality becomes very
important with Poincar´e’s formula.

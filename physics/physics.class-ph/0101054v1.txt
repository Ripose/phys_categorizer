The idea about a quantum nature of Planck’s blackbody radiation law is deeply
rooted in minds of most physicists. Einstein’s work, in which the coeﬃcients of
spontaneous and induced emission were introduced, has been always regarded to be
a proof that quantum energy discreteness of an atom plays a crucial role in the
derivation of this law. In our paper we avoid this standpoint. It may be shown that
the de Broglie wave, assigned to every material particle, is a result of interaction
the particle with the zero-point vibrations of electromagnetic ground ﬁeld. From
this fact is obtained the energetic spectrum of a harmonic oscillator within classical
physics which coincides with the quantum result. Thus, it is explained here how
the energy discreteness came into existence in stochastic electrodynamics (SED) —
the classical electrodynamics with classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation. We
next reconsider the Einstein work from the viewpoint of SED and derive the Planck
formula.

I. INTRODUCTION

Every time, when we discuss the Planck radiation law, the quantum radiation theory arises in its
monumentality before our mental vision. Its method of derivation of the probability coeﬃcients for
spontaneous and induced emission has not practically changed since the appearance of Dirac’s fun-
damental work [1] in 1927. But is this method so ﬂawless? Does an eye not catch any contradictions
that can be removed from the positions of modern physics? As early as 1939 V. L. Ginzburg [2] paid
his attention to one of such contradiction: an absence of correct limiting transition from quantum
theory to classical theory at ¯h → 0. In fact, in quantum theory the intensity of spontaneous emission

W sp

mn = Amn¯hωmn

is equal to zero at the limit ¯h → 0. At the same time the zero-point ﬂuctuations go to zero. But in
traditional classical theory the spontaneous emission is present in spite of the zero-point radiation
absence. The second contradiction is also obvious. If the existence of the zero-point radiation stems
naturally from the basis of quantum theory, why is it absent in the ﬁnal density radiation expression?
Thus, for the derivation of Planck’s formula after quantization of electromagnetic ﬁeld and obtaining
the coeﬃcients Amn and Bmn one must to refer to the Einstein method [3] of 1917. However, only
the expression

ρ (ω, T ) =

ω2
π2c3

¯hω
e¯hω/kT − 1

(1)

is derivable on this way. The zero-point term (ω2/π2c3)(¯hω/2) is absent here, but it produces
spontaneous transitions, according to quantum interpretation. Therefore, at the absolute zero of
temperature, the spontaneous emission must be absent also.

In this paper, we try to elucidate these questions, and at the same time propose a new method of
derivation of Planck’s radiation law. Here we operate only with classical ideas and avoid quantum
hypotheses completely. Such an opportunity is given to us by stochastic electrodynamics (SED).
It is a classical theory with classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation, which plays a role of the
vacuum. SED has almost 40 years history. It explains quantum phenomena by methods of classical
physics. Most comprehensive recent surveys on the subject are [4] and [5] ( see also now classical
works [6] and [7] ).

The basic postulate of SED is in the presence of classical stochastic electromagnetic zero-point
It is homogeneous,
(i.e. existing at the absolute zero of temperature) radiation in the universe.
isotropic, Lorentz-invariant and has the intensity 1
2 ¯hω per normal mode. According to SED, all
quantum eﬀects, by their essence, are the interaction eﬀects of matter with the zero-point radiation.
Indeed, there have been made many calculations in SED which prove complete connections with

the results of quantum mechanics (QM) on van der Waals forces [8-10], Casimir’s eﬀect [11,12],
correct behavior of a simple harmonic oscillator [13,14]. The atomic stability [6,15], the electronic
diamagnetism of metals [16], the thermal eﬀects of acceleration [17,18] have been explained. There
are works concerning classical hydrogen atom [19] which, as yet, have not reached the desirable goal.
But in our work, for the ﬁrst time, have obtained the exited states of harmonic oscillator, and the
result, we expect, opens a new avenue of attack on the hydrogen atom problem.

The electromagnetic theory of gravitation [20] was proposed by H. E. Puthoﬀ in 1989 on the ground
of one old idea of A. D. Sakharov. It has initiated the investigations of B. Haisch and co-workers
[21-24] on inertia. Actually very interesting question arises: can one change the physical, inertial
mass of an object situated in a container by changing the density of electromagnetic ﬁeld enclosed in
it? The calculations, made in works [21] and [23], even though are too complicated and overweighted
by details that hampers to see the physical essence of the subject, give very promising indications
that it is true. The result is obtained now only by methods of SED.

The derivation of Planck’s radiation law within classical physics was put forward long ago, mostly
in the works of T. H. Boyer [25-29]. However, only one method [29] was accepted as a correct one.
We believe that our method is correct too, and it has a close connection with the Einstein-Hopf
model, regarded by T. H. Boyer in work [25]. In one our future paper we are hope to tie up our main
equation (22) with the equation (35) of the T. H. Boyer work, proving by it that the atomic energy
discreteness is not the necessary condition for derivation of Planck’s radiation law.

Following the proponents of SED, we take seriously the presence of homogeneous isotropic Lorentz-

invariant electromagnetic ﬁeld with the density radiation

in the universe at the absolute zero of temperature. Therefore, we expect the following form of
Planck’s radiation law

ρzp =

¯hω3

ρ (ω, T ) =

ω2
π2c3 (cid:18)

¯hω
e¯hω/kT − 1

+

¯hω

.

In order to achieve this goal, our paper is arranged as follows. In the derivation of Eq. (3) we
lean upon Einstein’s paper [3] of 1917. We shortly remind its content in Sec. II. It is the irony of
fate that in this paper Einstein tried to show a reality of quanta. However, such an interpretation
of absorbtion and emission processes of the two-level system is far from being necessary. In Sections
III and IV we show that this system may be classical, in fact, by supplying the Einstein reasoning by
an idea of the classical zero-point radiation. The proof of our main result is made in Sec. V. Most
part of calculations is placed in Appendix.

II. EINSTEIN’S DERIVATION

Let us recall, at ﬁrst, the Einstein fundamental work [3]. More contracted exposition of its ideas

was presented in his with Ehrenfest work [30]. Allow us to repeat their considerations.

An atom can be found in two states Z and Z ∗ with energies ε and ε∗, respectively, (ε∗ > ε).
Assume their diﬀerence be equal ε∗ − ε = ¯hω. The atom is immersed in radiation of density ρ and is
in thermal equilibrium with it. Therefore, the level populations obey the canonical distribution law

n ∼ e

−ε/kT , n

∗

For transitions of the atom from Z ∗-state to Z-state during the time interval dt, we have the

probability

where a∗ is the spontaneous emission coeﬃcient, b∗ is the induced emission coeﬃcient. For Z → Z ∗
atom transitions, we have the probability

Hence, in equilibrium, the following equation is true

Using the Eq. (4) and the fact, that at T → ∞, ρ → ∞ and, therefore, b = b∗, we go to

The relation a∗/b∗ can be obtained by comparison of Eqs. (8) and (1). Obviously, if Einstein had
had the correct microscopic theory, he could have obtained the a∗ and b∗ coeﬃcients immediately
from it.
III we will propose such a microscopic theory which is alternative to Dirac’s
quantum theory of radiation. More speciﬁcally, it is already exists under the name of “stochastic
electrodynamics”, and we extend it by using the Einstein work, that has been exposed in this section.

III. QUALITATIVE INTRODUCTION TO STOCHASTIC ELECTRODYNAMICS

Of course, the standpoint of SED is extremely attractive for those who have strong inner protest
against the absence of space-time desciption in the atomic world, against the duality of physics. Let
us consider qualitatively some phenomena regarded earlier particular quantum.

Photoeﬀect. Conductivity electrons in metal interact with the zero-point radiation. Hence,
they have the kinetic energy 1
2 ¯hω on a frequency ω. Incoming radiation is involved in a resonance
process with the zero-point vibrations on a frequency ω, and the emitted electrons have the energy
proportional to ¯hω. Thus, the energy of photoelectrons depends only on the frequency, not on the
intensity of incoming radiation.

Stability of an atom in the ground state. Why doesn’t the radiating electron falls on the
nucleus? Because it absorbs energy continuously from the zero-point radiation. The balance of
energy between emitting energy of the electron rotating around the nucleus and its absorbing energy
dictates the radius of the principal orbit.

The existence of stationary atomic states. Let an electron moves around the nucleus on
the circular orbit with some frequency ω0. Such a motion may be replaced by harmonic vibrations
of two perpendicular to each other linear oscillators of natural frequency ω0 and phases shifted on
π/2. The oscillators interact with the zero-point radiation within a short frequency interval near
ω0. It would be natural to suppose that the stationary states (the ground state, anyway) are form
under an energetic balance of the electron and the ﬁeld. Louis de Broglie assigned the wavelength
to any material particle by extending relations E = ¯hω and ~p = ¯h~k that had been applicable to the
light only before. From the standpoint of SED the physical meaning of this procedure becomes clear
enough. The energy and momentum of a particle (two oscillators) are equalled to the mean energy
and to the mean momentum of ﬂuctuations of the interacting ﬁeld. An atom emits narrow lines of
a spectrum, because an electron may rotate stationary only on the orbits which include an integer
number of de Broglie waves. On the other orbits the de Broglie wave would cease because of phases
diﬀerences.

One and two-slit experiments. Let us imagine a wall with a slit and the zero-point radiation
around it. The zero-point radiation can be essentially homogeneous and isotropic only far from
matter. Near matter, the pattern of electromagnetic zero-point radiation is modiﬁed to reﬂect
presence of the slit. If an electron or other particle goes through the slit, it will be inﬂuenced by the
ﬁeld ﬂuctuations. The probability of its deﬂection, when it achieves the far screen, will be accounted
by the de Broglie wave diﬀraction.

If a wall has two slits, the zero-point radiation pattern will reﬂect this fact. It is evident that
every particular electron goes through only one of the two slits, and the diﬀraction picture arises as
a consequence of the wavelike properties of the zero-point radiation.

IV. DERIVATION OF ENERGY SPECTRUM FOR HARMONIC OSCILLATOR

Let us look at the two-level model of Einstein from the new point of view. Now, a discreteness of
stationary states can be understood qualitatively. In this Section we will show quantitatively, how
the existence of the ground and exited states are explained in SED for Hertz’s resonator, extending
the properties of which, Einstein came to his model.

In SED, just as like as in quantum electrodynamics (QED), a harmonic oscillator is the most

favorite object. At a time unit interval it emits the energy (see Appendix Eq. (A4)):

At the same time it absorbs the energy (see Appendix Eq. (A19)):

from the zero-point radiation. Equating (9) and (10), we obtain

which is the Bohr condition for atomic ground state. In the same manner formula (11) was ﬁrst ob-
tained in the paper [15], where H.E.Puthoﬀ has corrected the arithmetic error 3/4 made by T.H.Boyer
in the work [6]. His result, made for two oscillators, is valid also for one. In this case the oscillator
full energy

The result can be derived by another way. It is more common and was already used in the early
quantum theory. This is the introduction of the de Broglie wave. If we put one de Broglie wave on
the principal orbit, then the relation

.

By substituting Eq. (15) into (12), we obtain again the expression (13). It is important to remember
that the appearance of the de Broglie wave (14), in our interpretation, connected with the idea that
the particle moving with a constant velocity extracts from the zero-point radiation a single frequency
corresponding to the equality of momenta for the particle (constituting of two oscillators) and the
ﬂuctuations of radiation.

The further extention on the exited states, by such simple way, however, does not give the required
results. We would obtain the states with energies ¯hω, 3
2 ¯hω, 2¯hω and so forth that is inconsistent
with the quantum formula. Thus, let us consider the atom-ﬁeld interaction more closely. On this
way, in the future, we can refuse from the idea of the de Broglie wave completely, especially, from
the idea of moving on the orbit the de Broglie wave.

To understand what pattern the radiation has in vicinity of the atom, let us forget, for a while,
the model of rotating around the nucleus electron and look at the equivalent (in a sense of the wave
processes) picture of two perpendicular to each other oscillators. One is on the x axis, another on
the y axis. Let the monochromatic wave ξ1 = A0 cos ω0(t − x
c ) propogate to positive direction of x
axis; c is a velocity of the wave. It extracts a single wave with the same frequency and phase from all
vibrations of the zero-point radiation, propogating into the opposite direction, ξ2 = A0 cos ω0(t + x
c ).
As a result the standing wave forms

ξ = ξ1 + ξ2 = 2A0 cos 2π

If we return back to the model of the rotating electron and try to combine it with the resulting
ﬁeld pattern (16), we will go to the relation x = r. In this case, the electron occurs in the knots of
the standing wave with every revolution, and, therefore, will be able to conserve the uniform motion

on the orbit. Because the equality (13) is valid for the ground state (when there is only one standing
halfwave inside the orbit), it would be natural to assume that the equation

is also valid for all states, since the momentum transferred from the zero-point radiation to the
electron is the same in any state. Or, in a nonrelativistic approximation

As we have two oscillators, then using relation (12) we arrive at

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

which is in full accordance with the quantum result.

Thus, the idea of the de Broglie wave is appeared to be only a trick to account the interaction of

multiply periodic atomic system with the zero-point radiation.

It is interesting now to make a historical remark. When in 1926 Bohr and Schr¨odinger argued about
the interpretation of wave mechanics, and the latter put the statement that quanta are unnecessary
for understanding the quantum phenomena, Bohr refered to the derivation of Planck’s radiation law
in Einstein’s paper [3] as to his basic contraargument (the details of the discussion were vividly
described by Heisenberg in [31] ). We will show here that such a reference has a fragile basis.

V. DERIVATION OF PLANCK’S RADIATION LAW WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF SED

Our next step will be to obtain in a framework of SED such an equation that is a counterpart
to Einstein’s Eq. (7). For this purpose we must, ﬁrst at all, to realize, in a limiting clarity, what is
the spontaneous emission. After the appearance of Einstein’s work [3] and Dirac’s theory [1], in a
physical literature began frantic and fruitless discussions [2, 32-34] on the following questions. Have
the spontaneous emission either quantum or classical origin? Does the zero-point radiation induces
the spontaneous emission? Why the zero-point radiation aﬀect on matter twice as much, as usual
thermal radiation?

We believe that all those discussions occur because a mess of classical and quantum ideas.
In
stochastic electrodynamics the spontaneous emission has the unique and clear physical meaning: it
is the emission of classical system in the absence of external ﬁelds. A classical Hertz’s oscillator
emits energy (9). This is the spontaneous emission. It presents as in the exited state, as in the
ground state. In the ground state it cancels out by absorbtion completely and the atom does not
emits, whereas in the exited state the cancelation is in part only, and the atom emits. Naturally, the
oscillator must to absorb energy from the zero-point radiation in the both states.

All said is convinient to exhibit in the tabulated form.

in Einstein’s work
(n∗a∗ + n∗b∗ρT )¯hω emitted energy

in SED
n∗a∗ + na + n∗bρT
nbρT ¯hω absorbed energy nbρ0 + n∗b∗ρ0 + nbρT

In spite of the fact that the number of terms are doubled in SED, by comparison with Einstein’s
work, a striking symmetry is appeared now that was absent before. A physical meaning of the
coeﬃcients is altered in some details. Now a is the energy emitted by one atom and bρ0 is the energy
absorbed from the zero-point radiation by one atom. The asterisk means, as usual, belonging to the
exited state. In SED we do not speak anymore about a probability of transitions, since we have no
quanta of energy ¯hω now. Energy emits and absorbs continuously. However, taking into account

the assumption that the transition times is much smaller the living times in the ground and in the
exited state, we can write down the energy balance equation as

∗

∗

+ na + n

bρT = n

bρ0 + nbρ0 + nbρT .

∗

∗

(22)

Here, just like Einstein, we have used the limit T → ∞, from which follows that b∗ = b. It is not
diﬃcult to see from Eq. (22) that in SED, in contrast to Bohr’s theory, the emission processes occur
when an electron is in the exited state, not during a time of transitions between the states.

We consider now an another limit, T = 0,

The result is already known. It means the existence of the full energy balance in the ground state
at T = 0. The equation (22) reduces to

In the textbooks on quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum optics one can ﬁnd often the
statement that the spontaneous transitions appear as a consequence of atomic electrons interaction
with the zero-point vibrations of electromagnetic ﬁeld, or, the photon vacuum, because there can
not be self-emergent transitions in Nature, going on without any interactions. Needless to say, the
latter is true. However, the cause of the Hertz resonator emission in classical electrodynamics is not
the interaction with a vacuum, but the interaction with a self-ﬁeld, a self-action. In this paper we
have adhere strictly to the classical concept. In the case a mess of ideas does not arises.

According to quantum theory, an atom can have only a discrete set of states Z1, Z2, . . . , Zn with
eigenenergies ε1, ε2, . . . , εn. Einstein, studying the problem of derivation Planck’s radiation law, has
proposed the model of an atom which have only two states: Z — the ground state, from where the
spontaneous transitions are absent, and Z ∗ — the exited state from where occur as spontaneous
as stimulated transitions. From a view point of stochastic electrodynamics, classical theory with
classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation, the existence of the ground state Z is explainable by
an energy balance between self-emission and absorbtion from the zero-point radiation. If we assume
that the exited state is forms in the similar way (i.e. there are as absorbtion as emission for it),
then, as we had shown, it is easy to derive Planck’s radiation law within a framework of classical

physics. Einstein’s work on spontaneous and induced radiation would be stand in another light before
us. After making a proper interpretation to the spontaneous emission, we obtained the coeﬃcients
a and b without the postulates of quantum mechanics and the second quantization procedure. It
proves that the zero-point ﬂuctuations are not the reason of spontaneous transitions. The connection
between SED and QED is in using the same properties of a simple harmonic oscillator. However,
their interpretations of electromagnetic radiation are diametrically opposite. And today we could
incline to prefer SED because of its simplicity and duality absence.

After completing the calculations, exhibited in this paper, the author became aware that he is
hardly the ﬁrst who had hit upon a connection of the de Broglie wave with the zero-point radiation
[35].

The function 1/ |C (ω)|2 have a narrow maximum near ω = ω0 in the limit e2
m → 0. Therefore,
we can invoke the standard resonance approximation. We change ω on ω0 for it everywhere except
the diﬀerence ω − ω0 and take the integration limits go to −∞. Then we take the analogous inpact
of ω + ω0 into account. So, prove that

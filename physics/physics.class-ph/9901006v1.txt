Abstract

A new method of solving the Einstein–Friedmann dynamical equations of a spa-
tially homogeneous and isotropic universe is presented. The method is applicable
when the equation of state of the material content assumes the form P = (γ
1) ρ,
γ = constant. The solution for the expansion factor is commonly given only for
γ = 0, 1 and 4/3 when the curvature index is K =
1. The proposed procedure
is valid for general γ and K and it allows for ease of derivation of the solutions.
This alternative method is useful pedagogically to introduce basic cosmology.

1 Introduction

The Friedmann–Lemaitre–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) solutions to the Einstein ﬁeld
equations of general relativity are a cornerstone in the development of modern cos-
mology. The FLRW metric describes a spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe
satisfying the Copernican principle, and is the starting point for studying dynamical
models of the universe. To this end, one must specify the nature of the matter which is
the source of gravitation by assigning the corresponding equation of state, which varies
during diﬀerent epochs of the history of the universe.

The FLRW metric is given, in comoving coordinates (t, r, θ, ϕ), by the line element

where the three possible elementary topologies are classiﬁed according to a normalized
curvature index K which assumes the values 0,

function a(t) of the comoving time t (the “scale factor”) is determined by the Einstein–
Friedmann dynamical equations2−7

where ρ and P are, respectively, the energy density and pressure of the material content
of the universe, which is assumed to be a perfect ﬂuid. An overdot denotes diﬀerentiation
with respect to the comoving time t, G is Newton’s constant and units are used in which
the speed of light in vacuum assumes the value unity. It is further assumed that the
cosmological constant vanishes.

One can solve the Einstein–Friedmann equations (1.5) and (1.6) once a barotropic
equation of state P = P (ρ) is given. In many situations of physical interest, the equation
of state assumes the form

P = (γ

1) ρ ,

γ = constant .

This assumption reproduces important epochs in the history of the universe. For γ = 1
one obtains the “dust” equation of state P = 0 of the matter–dominated epoch; for
γ = 4/3, the radiation equation of state P = ρ/3 of the radiation–dominated era; for
γ = 0, the vacuum equation of state P =
ρ of inﬂation. For γ = 2/3, the curvature–
dominated coasting universe with a(t) = a0t is obtained.

When the universe is spatially ﬂat (K = 0), the integration of the dynamical equa-
tions (1.5), (1.6) with the assumption (1.7) is straightforward2 for any value of the
constant γ:

It is actually not diﬃcult to derive a solution for any nonzero value of the constant
γ using a standard procedure3 which is general, i.e.
it does not depend upon the as-
sumption P = (γ
1) ρ. Section 2 presents a summary of the usual method for deriving
the scale factor a(t). An alternative method, which consists in reducing the Einstein–
Friedmann equations to a Riccati equation, and is applicable when Eq. (1.7) holds, is
explained in Sec. 3. From the mathematical point of view, the latter method avoids the
consideration of the energy conservation equation

and the calculation of an indeﬁnite integral; rather, one solves a nonlinear Riccati equa-
tion. The alternative approach is more direct than the standard one and the gain
in clarity of exposition makes it more suitable for an introductory cosmology course.
Section 4 presents a brief discussion of the equation of state P = (γ
1) ρ and the
conclusions.

In order to obtain a(η), one prescribes the equation of state P = P (ρ), solves Eq. (2.1)
and inverts it obtaining ρ = ρ(a). Further substitution into Eq. (2.3) and inversion
provide a = a(η). Integration of Eq. (2.2) provides the comoving time t(η) as a function
of conformal time. The scale factor is then expressed in parametric form (a(η), t(η)).
Sometimes it is possible to eliminate the parametric dependence on η and obtain the
expansion factor as an explicit function a(t) of comoving time.

The method is quite general; as a particular case, it can be applied when the equation

The standard solution method of the Einstein–Friedmann equations has the virtue of
being general; it does not rely upon the assumption (1.7). However, the need to invert
Eqs. (2.1) and (2.3) and to compute the indeﬁnite integrals (2.6), (2.7) detracts from the
elegance and clarity that is possible when the ratio P/ρ is constant. The latter condition
is satisﬁed in many physically important situations.

3 An alternative method

There is an alternative procedure to derive the scale factor for a general value of γ when
1) ρ with
the equation of state of the universe’s material content is given by P = (γ
γ = constant, which covers many cases of physical interest. Being straightforward, this
new method is valuable for pedagogical purposes and proceeds as follows: Eqs. (1.5),
(1.6) and (1.7) yield

−

with c given by Eq. (2.11). For K = 0, Eq. (3.1) is immediately integrated to give
Eqs. (1.8), (1.9). For K =

1, Eq. (3.1) is rewritten as

by making use of the conformal time η, and where a prime denotes diﬀerentiation with
respect to η. By employing the variable

where y = y(x), has been the subject of many studies in the theory of ordinary diﬀerential
equations, and can be solved explicitly8,9. The solution is found by introducing the
variable w deﬁned by

which changes Eq. (3.4) to

the solution of which is trivial. For K = +1, one ﬁnds the solutions (2.12), (2.13), while
for K =

The alternative method is applicable when the equation of state assumes the form
P = (γ
1) ρ and the cosmological constant vanishes. With these conditions satisﬁed,
the alternative solution procedure is more direct than the general method. It is now
appropriate to comment on the equation of state P = (γ
1) ρ, γ = constant, which

reproduces several situations of signiﬁcant physical interest.

4 Discussion

The assumption that the equation of state is of the form P = (γ
1) ρ with constant γ is
justiﬁed in many important situations which describe the standard big–bang cosmology.
However, it is important to realize that Eq. (1.7) is a strong assumption and by no means
yields the most general solution for the scale factor of a FLRW universe. To make a
physically interesting example, consider the inﬂationary (i.e. ¨a > 0) epoch of the early
universe in the K = 0 case. Many inﬂationary scenarios are known10, corresponding to
diﬀerent concave shapes of the scale factor a(t); the assumption (1.7) allows the solutions

a(t) = a0t

3γ

a = a0eHt ,

˙H = 0

(4.1)

(4.2)

for γ = 0. Vice–versa, using the dynamical equations (1.5), (1.6), it is straightforward to
prove that the latter solutions imply P/ρ = constant. The assumption (1.7) reproduces
only exponential expansion (the prototype of inﬂation) and power–law inﬂation. All
the other inﬂationary scenarios correspond to a γ(t) which changes with time during
inﬂation. A time–dependent γ(t) can also be used to describe a non–interacting mix-
ture of dust and radiation; however the method of solution of the Einstein–Friedmann
equations (1.5), (1.6) presented in Sec. 3 applies only when γ is constant, and when the
cosmological constant vanishes. If the cosmological constant is nonzero, Eq. (3.1) does
not reduce to a Riccati equation.

The limitations of the assumption γ = constant are thus made clear: while this new
approach to the Einstein–Friedmann equations does not replace the standard approach,
it is more direct and is preferable in an introduction to cosmology. Its value lies in the
ease of demonstration of the solutions, which is crucial for students to grasp the basic
concepts of cosmology.

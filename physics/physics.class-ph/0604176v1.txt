By means of two-dimensional contact dynamics simulations, we analyze the vibrational dynamics
of a conﬁned granular layer in response to harmonic forcing. We use irregular polygonal grains
allowing for strong variability of solid fraction. The system involves a jammed state separating
passive (loading) and active (unloading) states. We show that an approximate expression of the
packing resistance force as a function of the displacement of the free retaining wall from the jamming
position provides a good description of the dynamics. We study in detail the scaling of displacements
and velocities with loading parameters. In particular, we ﬁnd that, for a wide range of frequencies,
the data collapse by scaling the displacements with the inverse square of frequency, the inverse of the
force amplitude and the square of gravity. Interestingly, compaction occurs during the extension of
the packing, followed by decompaction in the contraction phase. We show that the mean compaction
rate increases linearly with frequency up to a characteristic frequency and then it declines in inverse
proportion to frequency. The characteristic frequency is interpreted in terms of the time required
for the relaxation of the packing through collective grain rearrangements between two equilibrium
states.

INTRODUCTION

Depending on the frequency and amplitude of accel-
erations, vibrated granular materials give rise to vari-
ous phenomena such as compaction, ([1, 2]) convective
ﬂow([3, 4, 5]), size segregation and standing wave pat-
terns at the free surface ([3, 6, 7]). Particle rearrange-
ments induced by vibrations lead to lower shear strength
In the full ﬂuidization regime,
and larger ﬂowability.
there are no permanent contacts between particles and
the system behaves as a dissipative gas [8]. Particle bed
reactors are sometimes ﬂuidized by this method instead
of upward gas ﬂow ([9]). When particle accelerations
remain below the gravitational acceleration, the system
keeps its static nature and the vibrational energy propa-
gates through a rather compact network of interparticle
contacts. This leads to enhanced bulk ﬂow in hoppers
and chutes [10, 11].

On the other hand, vibrations at high frequency and
low amplitude lead to slow (logarithmic) decay of the
pore space as a function of time [5]. Eﬃcient vibro-
compaction of dry and wet granular materials is a cru-
cial issue in numerous applications such as the casting of
fresh concrete. The tamping operation on railway bal-
last is another example where the vibrations of tamping
bars are used to restore the initial geometry of the track
distorted as a result of ballast settlement ([12, 13, 14]).
The maintenance cost becomes crucial with the increase
of commercial speed.

We may distinguish two methods for inducing vibra-

tional dynamics: 1) by imposed cyclic displacements of a
wall or the container (shaking); 2) by cyclic modulation
of a conﬁning stress. The ﬁrst method has been used in
most experiments on granular beds ([15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20]). In this case, the control parameters are the ampli-
tude a and the frequency ν of the vibrations correspond-
ing to a maximal acceleration aω2 where ω = 2πν. When
a material is moulded inside a closed box, the vibrations
should rather be induced by varying a conﬁning force,
e.g. a force acting on a wall. Then, the amplitude of
displacements is a function of the forcing frequency, and
the level of particle accelerations depends on both the
applied cyclic force and the reaction force of the pack-
ing. In any case, an eﬃcient compaction process requires
periods of release of the packing so that the grains can
move with respect to their neighbors.

In this paper, we explore such a system where a har-
monic force f is exerted on a lateral wall of a closed box,
all other walls remaining immobile. The force f is var-
ied between zero and a maximum value fmax. During a
period, f is large enough to equilibrate the packing reac-
tion force except for a short laps of time when f declines
to zero. Then, the packing can ﬂow under the action
of its own weight, pushing the retaining wall away. We
are interested here in the evolution of the packing in the
course of harmonic loading and its scaling with loading
parameters (frequency, force maximum).

We used numerical simulations by the contact dynam-
ics approach as a discrete element method (DEM) in a
two-dimensional geometry with a small number of par-
ticles ([21, 22]). Each simulation is repeated for several
independent conﬁgurations and the results are analyzed
in terms of ensemble average behaviors. The particles
are rigid and polygon-shaped. We focus on the displace-

ments of the free retaining wall and the compaction of
the packing. Most results presented below concern the
short-time behavior where the solid fraction increases lin-
early with time. The frequency is varied from 1 to 60 Hz
and its inﬂuence is analyzed by considering characteristic
times involved in the loading and unloading intervals of
time. We ﬁrst introduce the numerical procedures. Then,
we present the main ﬁndings concerning the passive and
active dynamics, the evolution of the solid fraction and
scaling with the loading parameters.

II. NUMERICAL PROCEDURES

The simulations were carried out by means of the con-
tact dynamics (CD) method with irregular polygonal
particles ([21, 22]). The CD method is based on im-
plicit time integration of the equations of motion and a
nonsmooth formulation of mutual exclusion and dry fric-
tion between particles. This method requires no elastic
repulsive potential and no smoothing of the Coulomb fric-
tion law for the determination of forces. For this reason,
the simulations can be performed with large time steps
compared to molecular dynamics simulations. We used
LMGC90 which is a multipurpose software developed in
our laboratory, capable of modeling a collection of de-
formable or undeformable particles of various shapes by
diﬀerent algorithms ([23]).

The samples are composed of irregular pentagons,
hexagons, and heptagons of three diﬀerent diameters:
50% of diameter dmin = 2.5 cm, 34% of diameter 3.75 cm,
16% of diameter dmax = 5 cm; see ﬁg. 1. The particles
are initially placed on a square network in a rectangular
box and compressed by downward motion of the upper
wall (wall C in ﬁg. 1) at zero gravity. Then, the gravity
is set to g and the upper wall is raised 1 cm and ﬁxed.
The right wall (wall D in ﬁg. 1) is allowed to move hor-
izontally (x direction) and subjected to a driving force:

f (t) =

(fmax + fmin)
2

−

(fmax − fmin)
2

sin ωt,

(1)

where fmax and fmin are the largest and lowest compres-
sive (positive) forces acting on the wall.

If fmin is above the (gravitational) force exerted by the
grains on the free wall, f will be large enough to prevent
the wall from backward motion during the whole cycle.
In other words, the granular material is in ”passive state”
in the sense of Rankine’s states and the major principal
stress direction is horizontal ([24]). In this limit, no ex-
tension will occur following the initial contraction. On
the other hand, if fmax is below the force exerted by the
grains, f will never be large enough to prevent the ex-
tension of the packing. This corresponds to the ”active
state” where the major principal stress direction remains
vertical. In all other cases, both contraction and exten-
sion occur during each period, and the displacement ∆x
of the free wall will be controlled by fmin. In the sim-
ulations reported below, we set fmin = 0. This ensures

the largest possible displacement of the wall in the active
state. We used four diﬀerent values of fmax ranging from
5 .103 N to 2 .104.

The simulations were carried out with Np = 95 grains
in the box and each simulation was repeated with seven
independent grain conﬁgurations. The mean behavior for
each set of parameters is obtained by ensemble averaging
over seven independent data sets. Larger samples can be
simulated, but that requires much more computational
eﬀort for a parametric study over many cycles. Thus,
our system represents rather a thin granular layer. The
coeﬃcient of friction between the grains and with the
horizontal walls was ﬁxed to 0.4, but it was 0 at the ver-
tical walls. With a time step equal to 2.5 10−4 s we could
perform high-quality simulations in which the largest cu-
mulative error on grain positions was bellow 1%.

III. ACTIVE AND PASSIVE DYNAMICS

We ﬁrst consider the motion x(t) of the free wall (wall
D in Fig. 1) which reﬂects the dynamics of the grains in
the cell in response to harmonic forcing. Figure 2 shows
x(t) (averaged over seven independent simulations) for
frequency ν = 5 Hz over a time interval ∆t = 1 s. We
distinguish a fast initial contraction (t < 0.1 s) followed
by slow contraction (decreasing x) over four periods. The
initial contraction is a consequence of the gap left be-
tween the free surface of the packing and the upper wall.
This initial volume change is almost independent of fre-
quency. The subsequent periodic motion of the wall takes
place around this conﬁned state and will be at the focus
of this paper.

A zoom on a single period is shown in Fig. 3. The pe-
riod begins at the jamming position x = xj correspond-
ing to the jamming position reached in the preceding pe-
riod. The motion of the wall begins (point a in Fig. 3)
only when the applied force f declines near to its min-
imum fmin = 0. The maximum displacement ∆xmax
occurs at a later time δtr (point b). From a to b, the

force exerted by the packing on the free wall is above the
applied force, so that the wall moves backward (exten-
sion). In this phase, the packing is in an active state. The
inverse situation prevails from b to c where the grains are
pushed towards the box (contraction). Then, the pack-
ing is in a passive state. The new jamming position x′
j
is below the jamming position xj reached at the end of
the preceding period. The diﬀerence xj − x′
j represents
the net compaction of the packing over one period. For
a given frequency ν, the phase diﬀerence δtr is the same
for all periods. The displacement amplitude ∆xmax is a
function of fmax and ν, as we shall see below.

The motion of the free wall is governed by the equation

of dynamics,

f − fg = m¨x,

(2)

where fg is the horizontal force exerted by the packing
on the wall (ﬁg 1). Figure 4 displays fg as the function of
time for fmax = 2 104 N. We see that fg follows closely
the variations of f . In particular, in the jammed state
we have f = fg so that ¨x = 0 in this state. This means
that, in its most general form, fg is a function of f .

In the passive
phase, it grows faster and almost linearly as x decreases.
The vertical line corresponds to the jammed state where
fg decreases with f at x = xj . We also clearly observe in
Fig. 5(a) two transients : 1) unjamming and the onset
of the active state, 2) jamming from the passive state.

It is remarkable that, although xj decreases at the end
of each period, the dynamics remains self-similar up to a
translation along displacement coordinates.

Figure 5(b) displays fg as a function of the velocity
v ≡ ˙x. We again observe the passive (v < 0) and active
(v > 0) states together with the jamming and unjamming
transients before and after the jammed state (v = 0 and
x = xj ). The data from all periods follow the same
variations except for the jamming transient where a slight
decrease of the maximum negative velocity vmax can be
noticed in each period.

Although we focus here on the average dynamics of the
packing, i.e. the displacements of the free wall, it is im-
portant to note that the grain velocity ﬁeld is not a simple
oscillation around an average position. The grains un-
dergo a clockwise convective motion in the cell as shown
in Fig. 6. On the other hand, the contact forces evolve
between a fully jammed state, where nearly horizontal
force chains dominate (Fig. 7(a)), and the active state,
where nearly vertical gravity-induced chains can be ob-
served (Fig. 7(b)).

IV. A PHENOMENOLOGICAL MODEL

To predict the motion of the free wall from equation
2, we need to express the force fg as a function of x and
v. It is obvious that in the jammed state at x = xj , the
force fg is a reaction force balancing exactly the driving
force f so that v = 0. On the other hand, the inertia
eﬀects are small compared to static forces. To show this,
we may use a dimensionless number I deﬁned by ([25]):

I = ˙ε

m
p

,

(3)

r
where ˙ε = ˙x/x is the deformation rate, m is the total
mass, and p is the average pressure. The evolution of
I is plotted as a function of time in Fig. 8. The two

peaks in each period correspond to the maxima of the
largest velocities in absolute value shown in Fig. 5(b).
We see that I < 0.02, implying that fg should not depend
crucially on v. Let us note that the plot of fg vs v in
Fig.5(b) does not represent the explicit dependence of fg
on v; it is a consequence of the equation of dynamics and,
as we shall see below, it can be reproduced by assuming
no dependence of fg on v.

We now introduce a simple phenomenological model
in which the expression of fg as a function of x is ex-
tracted from the numerical data plotted in Fig. 5(a). As
shown in Fig. 9, two distinct ﬁtting forms are to be con-

tial form provides a nice ﬁt for the active branch whereas
a linear ﬁt seems fairly good in the passive state. Hence,
with a good approximation we can write

The constant forces f1, f2 and f3 correspond to the values
of fg at the unjamming transient, the jamming transient
and the point of transition from active to passive states,
respectively (see Fig. 9). Clearly, because of the action
of gravity and jamming transition, we have f1 > fmin
and f2 < fmax.

We substitute this expression 4 in equation 2 and we
solve for x. Analytical solution can be obtained for the
passive linear part. An approximate solution can be given
also for the active part by expending the exponential
function to leading order. Figure 10 shows the evolu-
tion of the position x for one period together with the
solution of the model.

between passive and active states is ensured by the very
choice of the coeﬃcients according to Eq. 5. Although
we did not take into account the transients, the analytical
plot ﬁts correctly the data.

Figure 11 displays fg vs v for one period, together with
the analytical ﬁt obtained as solution to Eq. 2 given the
expression 4 of fg as a function of x. Again, excluding
jamming and unjamming transients, the analytical solu-
tion provides a fairly good approximation for the simu-
lation data. Fig. 12 shows the trajectory of the motion
in the phase space ( ˙x, x) for one period, both from di-
rect data and the model. The ﬁt is globally acceptable
although the velocity is under-estimated in the passive
state.

The model parameters k and k′ remain nearly the same
over all periods. This means that the dynamics at short
times (∆t < 1 s) is weakly dependent on the solid frac-
tion. The parameters k and k′ change, however, with
loading parameters (ν, fmax, etc) unless the displace-
ments and the forces f1, f2 and f3 are scaled with these
parameters. This point will be discussed in detail below.

V. COMPACTION

In order to evaluate the solid fraction ρ, we consider a
control volume enclosing a portion of the packing inside
the simulation cell. This volume does not include the
initial gap between the top of the packing and the upper
wall. The initial value of the solid fraction is 0.75 and,
since the grains are angular-shaped, its variations ∆ρ
from the initial state are large.

Figure 13 shows the evolution of ∆ρ for several periods.
We observe an initial compaction of 3% occurring in 0.1
s. The subsequent evolution of the solid fraction takes
place in a more compact state with a small increase in
each period.

We use ρ0 = 0.77 at the end of the ﬁrst period as
the reference value for solid fraction. The relative com-

paction of the packing is given by ∆ρ/ρ0. The com-
paction rate η over several periods and for a total time
interval ∆t is

Fig. 14 shows the jamming position xj as a function of
time for diﬀerent frequencies for ∆t < 1 s. At such short
times, it can be assumed, with a good approximation,
that the solid fraction declines linearly in time. Gener-
ally, the behavior slows down logarithmically at longer
times [16]. This means that at short times, in which we
are interested in this paper, the compaction rate is nearly
constant, and we have

η ≡

1
ρ0

∆ρ
∆t

.

η =

∆ρ1
ρ0

ν,

where ∆ρ1 is the compaction per period. For ν = 5 Hz
and fmax = 2 104 N, we have η ≃ 0.009 s−1.

Interestingly, compaction occurs in the active state,
i.e. during the extension of the packing, and not during
contraction! This is shown in Fig. 15, where the variation
∆ρ of the solid fraction is plotted as a function of x. The
solid fraction increases during extension (increasing x)
and decreases during contraction (decreasing x).

Compaction upon the reversal of the direction of shear-
ing is a well-known property of granular media [26]. Low-
amplitude cyclic shearing leads to cumulative compaction
of a granular material. At larger amplitudes, the com-
paction is followed by decompaction (dilation) and no net
compaction can be observed over a full cycle. The sit-
uation is slightly diﬀerent in our system in the presence
of a jammed state. Compaction is a consequence of un-
jamming and it is pursued during the whole active state.
Decompaction takes place in the passive state, but it is
cut short by fast jamming. The outcome of a full cycle
is thus a net compaction of the packing.

VI. SCALING WITH LOADING PARAMETERS

In the last three sections, we analyzed the vibrational
dynamics and compaction for a single frequency ν = 5
Hz. Similar simulations were performed for several fre-
quencies ranging from 1 Hz to 60 Hz. Up to a change in
time and length scales, all simulations yield similar re-
sults both for dynamics and compaction independently
of the applied frequency. This can be seen, for example,
in Fig. 16(a) where the phase space trajectory is shown
for ν = 5 Hz and ν = 10 Hz. Fig. 16(b) shows that the
data from both simulations collapse nicely on the same
curve by simply scaling the displacements ∆x by ν−2 and
the velocities v by ν−1.

This scaling is suggested by a dimensional analysis of
the average dynamics of the packing. The frequency ν
sets the time scale τ = ν−1. Force scales are set by the
largest driving force fmax in the passive state and the
grain weights mg as well as the smallest driving force
fmin in the active state. Hence, dimensionally, for ﬁxed
values of mg, fmin and fmax, all displacements are ex-
pected to scale with ν−2 and all velocities with ν−1. To
check directly this scaling, in Fig. 17 we have plotted
the maximum displacement ∆xmax in the active state
and the maximum velocity vmax in the passive state as
a function of ν. The corresponding ﬁts by ν−2 and ν−1
are excellent.

The inﬂuence of loading force parameters mg, fmin
and fmax should be analyzed separately for each regime.
In the passive state, fmax is the dominant force and it
is exactly balanced by fg in jamming transition. On the
other hand, in the active state, mg is the dominant force
as f remains small compared to mg in this state. The
maximum displacement ∆xmax at transition from active
to passive state is determined in a subtle way by both
fmax and mg. If gravity were the only driving force in
the active state, ∆xmax would simply scale with gν−2
independently of fmax. However, our data show that
∆xmax varies as f −1
max; Fig. 18. A plausible dimensional
interpretation is to assume that ∆xmax is controlled by

where C is a dimensionless prefactor. This equation in-
cludes the correct scaling of ∆xmax with the frequency
ν (Fig. 17(a)) and with the force fmax (Fig. 18) . Inter-
estingly, Eq. 8 predicts that ∆xmax varies as g2. This
prediction is again in excellent agreement with our sim-
ulation data shown in Fig. 19 for four diﬀerent values of
g.

Equation 8 implies that the prefactor C is a mate-
rial constant that remains independent of all our load-
ing parameters. Fig. 20 shows ∆xmax as a function
of mg2/(fmaxν2) from diﬀerent simulations with diﬀer-
ent values of ν, fmax and g. The data are in excellent
agreement with the linear ﬁt suggested by Eq. 8 with
C ≃ 0.04.

The above scaling can be incorporated in the ﬁtting
form 4 expressing fg as a function of x − xj and three
forces f1, f2 and f3; see Fig. 9.
In this ﬁtting form,
the displacements should be divided by ∆xmax. We will

VII. COMPACTION RATES

Equation 7 suggests that the compaction rate η should
vary linearly with the frequency ν if the total compaction
per period ∆ρ1 is independent of ν. Fig. 21 shows η as
a function of ν. We see that only at low frequencies η
increases linearly with ν. At larger frequencies, beyond
a characteristic frequency νc, η declines with ν. The
largest compaction rate ηmax occurs for ν = νc. This
implies that, according to Eq. 7, ∆ρ1 is indeed indepen-
dent of ν for ν < νc. The characteristic time τc ≡ ν−1
can be interpreted as the minimum time laps required
for the relaxation of the packing. In fact, in the active
state, the packing needs a ﬁnite rearrangement time τc
to achieve a higher level of solid fraction. As long as the
period τ = ν−1 is longer than the relaxation time τc, the
packing has enough time to relax fully to a more compact

not study here in detail the dependence of f1, f2 and f3
with respect to loading force parameters mg, fmin and
fmax. Our simulations show that f3 is independent of
fmax, but it depends linearly on mg. Theoretically, this
state corresponds to the limit active state where the ratio
of principal stresses is a function of the internal angle of
friction [24]. On the other hand, the force f2 simply
scales as fmax and f1 depends both on fmin and mg. In

state. Then, the compaction ∆ρ1 has its maximum value
∆ρmax. But, if the period τ is below τc, the relaxation
will be incomplete so that ∆ρ1 < ∆ρmax.

Since the volume change ∆V is proportional to ∆x,
∆ρ1 follows the same scaling with the frequency as
the displacement of the retaining wall,
i.e. ∆ρ1 ∝
∆ρmax ν−2. Hence, from Eq. 7 and imposing the conti-
nuity at ν = νc, we get

This form (labeled 1) is plotted in Fig. 21 together with
the data points.
It is remarkable that, although νc is
the only ﬁtting parameter, the compaction rate η is well
adjusted by Eq. 9. The prefactor ∆ρmax/ρ0 is ≃ 1.5 ×
10−3, corresponding to ∆ρmax ≃ 1.1 × 10−3.

The arguments behind the proposed form 9 imply a
sharp transition at ν = νc. This is rather plausible in
view of the numerical data shown in Fig. 21. Never-
theless, it is convenient to construct a single expression
containing the correct behavior both at low and high fre-
quencies. The following ﬁtting form provides a good ap-
proximation as shown also in Fig. 21 (ﬁtting form 2):

We have νc ≃ 6 Hz corresponding to a characteristic
time τc = 0.17 s. This time interval is long compared to
single grain dynamics under gravity. For instance, the
time required for a small-size grain in our samples to fall
down a distance equal to its diameter is about 0.002 s.
Several observations show that collective rearrangements
in granular media are often a slow process ([27]). Let
us ﬁnally recall that our ﬁndings concern the short-time
behavior (∆t < 1 s). At longer times, η declines with
time, but the scaling with frequency according to Eq. 9
is expected to hold at each instant of evolution of the
packing.

VIII. CONCLUSION

9

In this paper, we analyzed the short-time behavior of
a constrained granular system subjected to vibrational
dynamics. The vibrations are induced by harmonic vari-
ation of the force exerted on a free retaining wall be-
tween zero and a maximum force. The system as a whole
has a single degree of freedom represented by the hori-
zontal position of the free wall. This system involves
a jammed state separating passive (loading) and active
(unloading) states. The contact dynamics simulations
were conducted with a rather small number of polygonal
grains allowing for a systematic study of the dynamics
and compaction of the material by varying the frequency
and averaging over several conﬁgurations each time. By
construction, our system is devoid of elastic elements and,
hence, the behavior is fully governed by collective grain
rearrangements.

In the loading phase, the reaction force (exerted by
the grains on the free wall) rises almost linearly with
the displacement of the free wall, but it increases con-
siderably at the end of this phase in transition to the
jammed state. This force enhancement features the jam-
ming transition compared to the rest of the passive state.
The reaction force decreases then in the jammed state,
balancing thus exactly the driving force, until the lat-
ter is low enough for the grains to push the free wall
away under the action of their own weights. This un-
jamming process occurs smoothly and the reaction force
increases only slightly but exponentially during the un-
loading phase. We showed that a rough expression of the
reaction force as a function of the displacement of the
free wall with respect to the jamming position, provides
a good prediction of the dynamics except at the jamming
and unjamming transients.

We used dimensional analysis to scale the dynamics
with the frequency ν of oscillations. It was shown that
the data for frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 60 Hz, col-
lapse by scaling the displacements by the inverse square
of frequency. On the other hand, we studies both numer-
ically and dimensionally the scaling with loading param-
eters mg and fmax.

We also investigated the oscillatory compaction of our
numerical samples. A small compaction occurs during
unloading, i.e. during the extension of the sample, fol-
lowed by a smaller decompaction during loading. The
compaction rate is nearly constant for short times.
It
was shown that the compaction rate increases linearly
with frequency up to a characteristic frequency and then
it declines nearly in inverse proportion to frequency. The
characteristic frequency was interpreted in terms of the
time required for the relaxation of a packing in each pe-
riod to a more compact state by collective grain rear-
rangements under the action of gravity. The decreasing
compaction rate as a function of frequency beyond the
characteristic frequency was explained by arguing that
only a partial relaxation, inversely proportional to fre-
quency, could occur at such frequencies.

A similar investigation is currently under way with
polyhedral grains in three dimensions. Our preliminary
results are consistent with those presented in this paper.
In view of applications to a wider range of boundary con-
ditions or diving modes, it is also important to consider
in detail the characteristic time and the inﬂuence of vari-
ous parameters pertaining to particle properties. Finally,

long-time behavior and slow evolution of the compaction
rate may be studied in this framework though more nu-
merical eﬀort is necessary to reach signiﬁcant results in
this case.

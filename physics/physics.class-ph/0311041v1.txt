ON THE FASTER-THAN-LIGHT MOTIONS IN ELECTRODYNAMICS

Abstract

A variant of electrodynamics is constructed in which faster-than-light motions are

possible.

·

The existence of faster-than-light motions (with velocities v > 3

1010 cm/sec) is the
subject of discussion in modern physics.
It is in 1946-1948 when Blokhintsev already [1]
paid attention to the possibility of formulating a ﬁeld theory that permits the propagation
of faster-than-light (superluminal) interactions outside the light cone. Kirzhnits (1954) [2]
showed that a particle possessing the tensor of mass M i
k = diag(m0, m1, m1, m1) may move
with the faster-than-light velocity if m0 > m1. Terletsky (1960) [3] introduced into theoret-
ical physics the particles with imaginary masses moving faster-than-light. Feinberg (1967)
[4] named these particles tachyons and described their main properties. Research on the
superluminal tachyon motions opened up additional opportunities which were studied by
[4]),
many authors (hundreds publications), for example by Bilaniuk and Sudarshan (Sb.
Kirzhnits and Sazonov (Sb. [4]), Recami [5], Mignani (Mon. [5]), Corben (Mon. [5]).

The publications are also known in which the violation of invariance of the speed of light
is considered [6] - [12]. One can note, for example, Pauli monograph [6] with the elements of
Ritz and Abraham theories; Logunov lections on Relativity Theory [7]; Glashow paper [8]
on the violation of Lorentz-invariance in astrophysics; publications [9] - [12] considering the
violation of invariance of the speed of light in SR.

Below a version of the theory permitting faster-than-light motions of electromagnetic
ﬁelds and charged particles with real masses is proposed as the continuation of such inves-
tigations.

where t is the time, x, y, z are the spatial variables, v is the velocity of a particle being

of space, the velocity v does not depend on space-time variables. Let the proper value of the
speed of light be invariant:

They belong to the group of direct product L6XS1, where L6 is the Lorentz group, S1 is
the scale transformations group c′ = γc. One can say that these transformations act in the
5-space V 5 = M 4XV 1, where V 1 is a subspace of the velocities of light c. The relationship
between the partial derivatives of variables (t, x, y, z) and (x0, x1, x2, x3) are as follows:

The expressions for ∂/∂y and ∂/∂z are analogous to the expression ∂/∂x. Below we restrict
our study by the case, when the velocity of light in the range of interaction does not depend
on the space variables. Then

c(t) = 0.

Some features of this study are:
1. As in SR, parameter β = V /c in the present work is in the range 0
2. As in SR, the value dx0 is the exact diﬀerential.
3. The time x0 =
4. The property β=const is compatible with V (t), c(t).

Keeping this in mind, let us construct a theory in M 4 and reﬂect it on the space R4.

Following [13], we start from the expression for integral of action:

Here Sm is the action for a free particle; Sf is the action for a free electromagnetic ﬁeld; Smf
is the action for interaction between a charge e and electromagnetic ﬁeld; m is the mass of
a particle, ji = (ρ, ρuα) [6] is the 4-vector of current density; uα = vα/c is the 3-velocity
of a particle. The meaning of the other values is standard. Accordingly to the construction,
the action is Lorentz invariant and does not depend on the velocity of light c. As a result
the action is also invariant with respect to the group of direct product L6XS1. Lagrangian

accordance with p = n

the velocity of the light source, Compton eﬀect, decay of unstable particles, creation of new
particles in nuclear reactions, possible faster-than-light motions of nuclear reaction products.
For example, in the case of Compton eﬀect [15] we ﬁnd from the law of energy-momentum

may exceed the speed of light c0: ve(α = 0) = ¯hω/mc0
which is in accordance with the formula (16) and diﬀers from SR. The velocity of scattered
γ quantum does not depend on the angle θ and is determined by mechanism of scattering
(immediately, or in the act of absorption-emission by scattered electron).

As a result the theory has been constructed which is invariant with respect to the group
of direct product L6XS1. In accordance with [1] we may assume that the proposed theory
may be useful in the ﬁeld of quantum physics of extended particles, where the property of
elementary nature should not contradict to their possessing dimensions.

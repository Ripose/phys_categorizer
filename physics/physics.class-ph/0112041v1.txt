Abstract

Elements of a little-known vector theory of open resonators and experiments on excitation of a fundamental
mode with transverse and longitudinal polarization in such resonators are discussed.
PACS number(s): 41.60.Cr.

Keywords: Open resonators, Longitudinal fundamental TEM mode, polarization.

The propagation of electromagnetic waves in
vacuum is described by Maxwell equations. More
simple wave equations for electromagnetic ﬁelds
coupled by conditions div ~E = div ~H = 0, or for
the potentials ~A, ϕ introduced by the equations
~H = rot ~A, ~E = −gradϕ − (1/c)(∂ ~A/∂t) and cou-
pled by a gauge condition can be used for a simpli-
ﬁed solution of electrodynamic problems. The fol-
lowing simpliﬁcation is using the electric and mag-
netic Hertz vectors ~Πe, ~Πm. They are introduced
by ~A = (1/c)(∂ ~Πe/m)/(∂t), ϕ = −div~Πe/m. The
so deﬁned potentials ~A and ϕ will satisfy both the
gauge and Maxwell equations. In this case, the
electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths are

The vectors ~Πe and ~Πm fulﬁl the wave equation
✷~Πe/m = 0. We can identify the solution of the
scalar wave equation ✷U = 0 with one component
of vectors ~Πe or ~Πm (e.g. ~Πe = ~ex ·0 +~ey ·0 +~ez ·U,
~Πm = 0). Substituting the vector in (1) we ﬁnd
the electromagnetic ﬁeld strengths. Then we can

identify the same solution U by another compo-
nent of the Hertz vector, equate the rest compo-
nents to zero, and calculate the other electromag-
netic ﬁeld strengths. After going through all the
compositions of components we obtain a set of six
diﬀerent electromagnetic wave modes [1].

The monochromatic light beams of a limited
diameter related to the resonator modes can be
written in the form U = V (x, y, z)ei(kz−ωt), where
V (x, y, z) is the function of a coordinate slowly
varying in comparison with exp[i(kz − ωt)]. In a
paraxial approximation |∂2V /∂z2| ≪ 2k|∂V /∂z|,
k = ω/c this form is described by the equation
2ki∂V /∂z + ∂2V /∂x2 + ∂2V /∂y2 = 0. The solu-
tion of this equation by the method of separation
of variables in the cylindrical coordinates, where
V (x, y, z) = G(u)Φ(φ) exp[ikr2/2q(z)]·exp[iS(z)],
x2 + y2, and φ are the cylindrical coordi-

where the upper superscripts show the composi-
tion of the electric Hertz vector corresponding to
the transverse (x,y) and longitudinal (z) polariza-
tions. The second case can be received from the
ﬁrst one by substitution of the variable x by y,
and vice versa. The ﬁeld strengths received from

the magnetic Hertz vector are ~E
In the ﬁrst case, the Gaussian beam has mainly
the transverse ﬁeld components, where Ee,1
z (r =
0) = 0. In the third case, the ﬁeld components are
compatible by the value (Ee,1
z (r = 0) 6= 0) [1], [2].
These are the fundamental transversely and longi-
tudinally polarized T EM e,1
00 (T M01)
modes, accordingly. The T EM e,3
00 modes can be
excited by the transition radiation emitted on mir-
rors of open resonators by electrons that are ho-
mogeneously moving along their axes. Such an ex-
citation was probably observed in the experiments

00 and T EM e,3

published in [3]. Previous experiments on excita-
tion of open resonators were done under condi-
tions when the electron trajectories were directed
either at some angle to the axis of a resonator [4],
or along caustics of the fundamental mode of a res-
onator [5], where the fundamental T EM e,1
00 modes
had not a longitudinal component of the electric
ﬁeld strength at the open resonator axis. Elec-
tron beams of ﬁnite transverse dimensions mov-
ing along the exes of open resonators can excite
non-eﬃciently higher modes like T EM e,1,2
hav-
ing small longitudinal components near the exes
of resonators [3, b].

Excitation of the T EM e,3

00 modes is possible
at even harmonics of undulator radiation in free-
electron lasers using the ﬂat undulators with a
high deﬂecting parameters when the amplitudes of
longitudinal oscillations are high. Radiation stored
at this mode in supercavity can be used for laser
driven acceleration in vacuum as well.

Abstract A simulation of electric current pulses formed by a packet of gamma-quanta moving
through an absorptive medium is presented. The electromagnetic ﬁelds of the current pulse
moving along the straight line with super light velocity are obtained.

1 Introduction

In recent years the electromagnetic ﬁelds of sources moving with velocities equal or higher than
velocity of light c in vacuum have been discussed in connection with an interest to the problem of
localized electromagnetic waves [1, 2]. Such a source can be obtained by interaction of a directed
beam of a hard electromagnetic radiation (X-rays) with an absorptive rod. It is important to have
the length of this rod larger than its diameter. If initial quanta are moving along the axis of this
rod, the electron’s current pulse whose velocity is equal to c is generated. If the beam is directed at
an angle to the rod’s axis, the current pulse has a super light velocity. The velocities of electrons, of
course, are smaller than c, but the motion of area, where the current’s density is non zero, can be
presented as the motion of some eﬀective charge which is faster than the velocity of light in vacuum.
The investigation of the spatial structure and of the time dependence of secondary electromagnetic
ﬁelds, generated by such a pulse, requires solution of two problems. Firstly, we have to ﬁnd the shape
of the current pulse generated by the beam of primary hard electromagnetic radiation. Secondly, we
have to solve the Maxwell’s equation for this current’s pulse with zero initial conditions. The current
pulse in question was earlier studied mainly on a phenomenological basis. The current pulse moving
with velocity of light was considered in connection with nuclear explosions [3].
In this paper we calculate the “realistic” shape of current pulse moving with super-light velocity,
taking into account the microscopic movements of the electrons. We obtained electromagnetic ﬁelds
with this current pulse by using the approach presented in [4], based on the method of an incomplete
separation of variables by V.I. Smirnov [5] and Riemann formula.

2 The shape of the super-luminal current

pulse generated by a shot-lived beam of a hard radiation

The solution of the ﬁrst problem of ﬁnding the shape of current pulse requires to take into account
the photon absorption’s processes, Compton scattering, and secondary coupling eﬀects of “delta

electrons” with matter which result in the formation of the ions and the electrons. We found the
shape of current pulse via the computational experiment using the method of numerical modelling
described in [6]. This method enables us to study the time dependence of the electrons’ distribution
in the phase space. The code GEANT [7] was used. The generation of the electrons with energy
lower than 10 keV was not taken into account.

The scheme and the initial conditions of the computational experiment are as follows. The
absorbing area is placed in vacuum and is bounded by the cylindrical surface of 0.3 m. in diameter
and of 50 m. in length L and by the two planes, which are orthogonal to the cylinder axis. Its walls
are made of hydrocarbon-based material. Their thickness is 0.001 m. The absorptive medium is air
at the pressure of 1 atm. The symmetry axis of the absorbing area coincides with the axis z of a
cylindrical coordinate system .

The origin of the coordinate system is chosen to be localized at the point O, which lies in one of

the two above mentioned planes.

The packet of the primary photons (a gamma-ray pulse) starts from a surface formed by rotation
of a line segment, which is at an angle π/2- θ to the Z axis . The photons are simultaneously emitted
at an angle θ to the direction of the z axis.

The computational experiment is beginning with the starting time of the gamma-ray pulse. The

results of computer experiments are as follows:

1. We obtained the distribution N(ρ) of the secondary photoelectrons which have passed through
the plane ﬁxed at z=z0. This distribution describes the electron localization in the radial direction
ρ.

2. The width (∆R) of the distribution N(ρ) calculated for the above initial conditions is less
than 30 centimeters (∆R < 30cm). The obtained value meets the necessary requirement of the
applicability of the model of a linear current (L >> ∆R), used in the simpliﬁed electrodynamic
calculations.

The time dependence of the current’s pulse passing through the absorptive area at z0 = 30 meters

is shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 1: The normalized current pulse in the cross section of the absorbing region at z = 30 m.

In this plot the value of function in maximum is presented as 1.0 on the axis of ordinates. The

2

pulse length (∆T) taken on the ordinates level of 0.1 does not exceed 0.2 ns (or 6 cm in ct - units).
The obtained value of ∆T estimates the localization of the current along z – axis.
The shape of the running pulse can be described by the following function:

J(z, τ ) = A

αi > 0, i=1,2,
where τ = ct is the time variable, β = v/c , A is constant ; coeﬃcients αi are obtained by the least
square method

Thus, as a result of the above computational experiment the space-time description of the hard

radiation inducing super light running pulse was obtained.

3 Calculation of the magnetic component of the electro-
magnetic wave generated by the current pulse moving
with super light velocity

The basic solution of the Maxwell equations that describes waves generated by a current pulse
propagating along the section of a strait line was given in [2]. In that work the components of both
the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are expressed via a single scalar function v(ρ, z, τ ). In the present
work we represent only magnetic component B. That was made to simplify the subsequent physical
interpretation of the obtained results.

In our case the parameters of the hard radiation and absorptive medium, geometry of the ab-
sorptive area were chosen in accordance with the condition L >> ∆R. The boundary eﬀects in
the description of a source of electrodynamics problem are not taken into account (the necessary
requirement L >> ∆T is met). This means that for the calculation of the required electromagnetic
ﬁeld (its magnetic component) we may use the simpliﬁed model of a linear current.

Thus the source in the electrodynamics problem (non-zero component of the current’s density

vector) can be taken in the form:

jz =

h(βτ

z)h(z)h(L

z)J(z, τ )

Here δ(ρ) is the Dirac distribution, h(z) is the Heaviside step function.
In the case of the axial -
symmetric source of an electrodynamics problem, the components of the intensity E of electric ﬁeld
and the induction B of magnetic ﬁeld may be expressed via one scalar function v according to the
following expressions:

∂2u
∂z2 Bϕ =

In the proximity of the angle θ = arccos(c/v) = 5.710 the function v(ρ, z, τ )sharpens its form.
Note, that the variation of parameters of numerical experiment causes essential changes of v(ρ, z, τ )
. In particular, the reduction of value of L results in disappearance of a characteristic maximum in
the distribution v(θ) at θ = arccos(c/v). The dependence of Bϕ component on τ at various angles of
observation θ (L = 50m, Z = 50000m) is presented in Fig.3.

As we see, duration of the two-polar pulses of an electromagnetic ﬁeld depends on angle θ.

Summary

We have calculated the shape of a the current pulse moving with velocity greater then the velocity
of light in vacuum for the certain geometry of the hard radiation at ﬁxed values of parameters of
gamma - quanta pulse moving through a layer of air.

The analytic representation for the potential v(ρ, z, τ ) was obtained for the case of the superlu-

minal delta pulse.

The spectra of radiation in the optical range for some diﬀerent observation angles range for v/c

equal 1.005 were calculated. We found that the radiation has maximum at θ ∼= arccos(c/v).

Abstract

We discuss the work-kinetic energy theorem and the mechanical energy conservation theorem in
the context of general physics courses. The motivation is the fact that all modern texts on introductory
mechanics show the same conceptually dangerous statement that besides obliterating the concept of
mechanical work, diminishing the importance of the work-kinetic energy theorem, leads to erroneous
applications of the energy conservation theorem and at the same eliminates its relationship with the
principle of the conservation of the mechanical momentum.

Introduction: The work-kinetic energy theorem

Newton’s laws of motion for a material point are at the very core of classical mechanics. Nevertheless,
the application of those laws to more complex systems is not possible without the introduction of more
encompassing concepts and general theorems. Here we will consider two of those theorems, namely, the
work-kinetic energy theorem and the mechanical energy conservation theorem. The main motivation for
this choice is the fact that almost all modern texts, see for example [1, 2, 3], on introductory mechanics
show the same conceptually dangerous statement that besides obliterating the concept of mechanical
work, diminishing the importance of the work-kinetic energy theorem, leads to erroneous applications
of the energy conservation theorem and at the same eliminates its relationship with the principle of the
conservation of the mechanical momentum. A system of particles is a set of arbitrarily chosen particles.
It is important to stress that, once the system is chosen, no particle gets in or out of it, at least during
the time interval, ﬁnite or inﬁnitesimally small during which we observe it and apply to it the theorems
of classical mechanics. It is convenient to divide the particles into two sets, the set of those that belong
to the system under study and the set of those that do not belong to the system. The former are
called internal particles and the latter external particles. The work-kinetic energy theorem states that
the variation of the kinetic energy of a system of particles is equal to the total work performed by all
forces acting on the system, the internal ones and the external ones. The principle of conservation of
the mechanical energy follows from this theorem, therefore it is not a principle at all but a demonstrable
corollary to it. However, in order to prove this corollary we must suppose that the system is isolated and
that the internal forces are derivable from a scalar potential or do not perform mechanical work at all.
It follows from this that standard problems such as the free fall, the frictionless sliding of a block on the
surface of a wedge, the rolling without slipping of a sphere on an inclined plane, the gravitational catapult
and many others cannot be solved with the (mis)use of the principle (corollary) of the conservation of
the mechanical energy. The reason is very simple: the total mechanical energy of the system in these
examples is not conserved. In what comes next we will strive to clarify this apparently bold statement.

2 Some simple examples

≫

m. Let us analyse the problem initially from an inertial reference system

Consider a small block of mass m sliding without friction on the surface of a wedge with a mass M such
that M
ﬁxed to the wedge.
The initial height of the small block is h and for the sake of simplicity we assume that the initial velocity
is zero. The usual solution largely disseminated by the most popular textbooks on general physics [1, 2, 3]
is based on the principle (corollary) of the conservation of mechanical energy. The reasons invoked for its
application are: (i) there is no friction in the interface between the block and the wedge, (ii) the normal
force (the constraint) does not perform work on the block. In this way, taking as a reference a point
at the base of the wedge and recalling that the total energy is the sum of the potential energy and the
kinetic one we obtain the following equation

S

where v is the velocity at the base of the wedge and parallel to it. Solving for

we obtain

Consider now the same problem observed from a reference system
such that the velocity V of

Then the initial velocity of the small block is V and its ﬁnal velocity is v + V. Therefore, the total initial
energy of the block is

E1 =

The last equation shows clearly that the total energy of the block in the reference system
conserved and that there is no sense in talking about the conservation of the energy of the block with
or any other reference system. This is so because for strong physical reasons the
respect to the system
principle must hold in any inertial reference system. This point is clearly stressed at the introductory
[4], to the authors’ knowledge. Here, the illusion of the conservation of the energy,
level only in Ref.
according to Eq. (5), holds in the
reference system only. In this particular problem we ﬁnd an additional
complication, to wit, the system is not isolated since the wedge is on an horizontal plane. If we change
the block by a rigid sphere that can roll down along the wedge without slipping we will ﬁnd the same
diﬃculties found in the sliding of the block. The fact that the friction forces do not perform work as
textbooks usually state is no excuse for applying the conservation of energy. In these two examples, the
impossibility of making use of the conservation of the energy becomes crystal clear if we take into account
that in another inertial reference system the normal force and the friction force surely will do mechanical
work.

Consider now an equally simple problem that can be viewed as an isolated system, but again the
conservation of mechanical energy is erroneously applied to a part of the system only. Consider the free
fall of a particle of mass m from a height h above the surface of the Earth and calculate its velocity
immediately before it hits the ground. Most textbooks analyse the problem from the viewpoint of an
inertial reference system
ﬁxed with respect to the Earth and make use of the conservation of mechanical
energy to obtain the ﬁnal velocity, see for example [1, 2]. Besides, it is argued that since the Earth has
a much larger mass than the particle it follows that its acceleration is negligible and therefore it can be
considered as good approximation to a bona ﬁde inertial reference system. The solution follows imediately
from these assumptions. We write

S

and solve for
the Earth is V. The initial energy is given by

Once again conservation of the mechanical energy holds for one special reference system, the one in which
the Earth is at rest.

3 The sliding block problem revisited

In the examples considered above it was shown that the mechanical energy is not conserved in an arbitrary
inertial reference system if the mechanical system under study is not isolated. But our conclusion is based
on the galilean rule for the transformation of velocities from one inertial system to another one. Our
aim now is to show how a consistent application of the conservation laws of energy and momentum allow
us to obtain the correct results. In order to do this we will simplify the problem and will keep only its
essential features. We start by showing in a speciﬁc example that the conservation theorems correctly
applied lead to the conclusion that the inﬁnite mass of a part of the mechanical system is no excuse for
disregarding energy and/or linear momentum transfer to it.

Consider again the problem of small block of mass m sliding down the inclined surface of a wedge of
mass M . Choose an inertial system with respect to which the velocity of the wedge is always horizontal.
Applying the theorems of the conservation of mechanical energy and linear momentum to the system
constituted by the wedge and the small block we can write

(M + m) V0 = M V + mvx,
(11)
where V0 is the initial velocity of the wedge, h is the initial height of the small block and vx and vy
are the horizontal and the vertical components of its velocity at an arbitrary point. We have one more
equation to write that reﬂects a kinematical constraint: the small block must never leave the inclined
surface of the wedge, i.e.,

where θ is the measure of the angle formed by the inclined surface of the wedge and the horizontal
reference line. Equations (10) and (11) can be rewritten in the form

This example clearly shows how the principle of conservation of mechanical energy is misused. In the ﬁrst
place, Eq. (10), though correct, cannot be interpreted as conservation of energy because the system is not
isolated, the external forces being supplied by gravity and contact forces. Equation (10) is a consequence
of the work-kinetic energy theorem, which, in an obvious notation, reads for the system small block +
wedge

Wg + Wc.f. = mgh = ∆KM + ∆Km.

In the second place, Eq. (23) shows that even in the inﬁnite mass limit, or if one prefers, when M
there is energy transfer to the wedge.

4 Another example: The frontal collision problem

As a second example consider a block of mass M at rest with respect to the inertial reference system
and also a particle of mass m moving with a velocity u on a head-on collision course with the block.
S
Suppose also that there is no external force acting on the parts of the system. In the end, of course,
we will be interested in the particular, but important case where the mass of the block goes to inﬁnity
u and the
(M
ﬁnal velocity of the block is still null. We will demonstrate that these results cannot be obtained with
the application of the principle of the conservation of the energy only. Going from the inertial reference

we write

where U and u are the velocities of the block and of the particle respectively, after the collision. Solving
for U and u we obtain

Once again it is clear that the energy and the momentum of the block change even when its mass goes
to inﬁnity, or if we prefer, when M
m. However, in the special case where the initial velocity of the
block is zero (V = 0), only its linear momentum changes.

5 Clarifying the matter

Consider the problem from a general point of view. Let a system of N + M particles each with a mass
mi, i = 1...N + M be. Suppose that the system is isolated. Suppose also that the internal forces
can be classiﬁed into two sets, namely: the set of conservative forces and the set of forces that do not
perform work. Denoting by xi the position and by vi the velocity of of particle of mass mi, we write
the total mechanical energy, the total linear momentum of the system, and the total angular momentum,
respectively, as

where U (xi) is the total internal potential energy of the system, and

Divide the system into two subsystems. The subsystem A formed by the i = 1...N particles and the
subsystem B formed by the N + 1...N + M remaining particles. In this way the total mechanical energy
given by Eq.
(37) and the angular momentum can
decomposed in the following way

(36), the total linear momentum given by Eq.

where TA (B) is kinetic energy of the system A (B), UA (B) is the potential energy of A (B), and UAB is the
interaction potential between the two subsystems. Recall that the complete system is isolated, therefore
these mechanical quantities are conserved, that is

E = TA + TB + UA + UB + UAB,

In Eq. (52), the velocities VB and ωB depend both on time.
let us analyse now what happens when

obtain

EAB := TA + UA + UAB.

(51)
When we take inﬁnite mass limit the total linear momentum PA of the subsystem A remains constant,
therefore we conclude that the velocity VB and the angular velocity ωB remain constant. The total energy
and
of the subsystem hence is not conserved. Nevertheless, in the inertial system, in the limit MB

Equation (52) cannot be considered as a conservation law for the mechanical energy because it holds only
in the inertial reference system for which the velocity of the subsystem B is zero. One must keep always
in mind that a true conservation law must hold for all inertial reference system. Moreover, Eq. (49) that
deﬁnes this energy contains the term UAB that describes the interaction energy of the two systems, hence
it cannot be interpreted as the total energy of the subsystem A.

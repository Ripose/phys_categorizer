Abstract

We use the fractional integrals to describe fractal media. We consider the fractal
media as special (”fractional”) continuous media. We discuss the possible experimental
testing of the continuous medium model for fractal media that is suggested in Phys.
Lett. A. 336 (2005) 167-174. This test is connected with measure of period of the
Maxwell pendulum with fractal medium cylinder.

1 Introduction

The real structure of the media are characterized by an extremely complex and irregular ge-
ometry [1]. Because the methods of Euclidean geometry, which ordinarily deals with regular
sets, are purely suited for describing objects such as in nature, stochastic models are taken
into account [2]. Another possible way of describing a complex structure of the media is to
use fractal theory of sets of fractional dimensionality [1]. Although the fractal dimensionality
does not reﬂect completely the geometric properties of the fractal, it nevertheless permits a
number of important conclusions about the behavior of fractal structures [3, 4]. For example,
if it is assumed that matter with a constant density is distributed over the fractal, then the
mass of the fractal enclosed in a volume of characteristic dimension R satisﬁes the scaling
law M(R) ∼ RD, whereas for a regular n-dimensional Euclidean object M(R) ∼ Rn. Let us
assume that a medium can be treated on a scale R as a stochastic fractal of dimensionality
D < 3 embedded in a Euclidean space of dimensionality n = 3. Naturally, in real objects
the fractal structure cannot be observed on all scales. For example, Katz and Thompson
[5] presented experimental evidence indicating that the pore spaces of a set of sandstone
samples are fractals in length extending from 10 angstrom to 100 µm.

In the general case, the fractal media cannot be considered as continuous media. There
are points and domains that are not ﬁlled of the medium particles. We suggest to consider the
fractal media as special (fractional) continuous media. We use the procedure of replacement

1

of the fractal medium with fractal mass dimension by some continuous medium that is
described by fractional integrals. This procedure is a fractional generalization of Christensen
approach [6]. Suggested procedure leads to the fractional integration and diﬀerentiation to
describe fractal media. The fractional integrals allow us to take into account the fractality of
the media. In order to describe the fractal media by continuous medium model, we must use
the fractional integrals. The order of fractional integral is equal to the fractal mass dimension
of the media. More consistent approach to describe the fractal media is connected with the
mathematical deﬁnition of the integrals on fractals. In Ref.
[8] was proved that integrals
on net of fractals can be approximated by fractional integrals. Therefore, we can consider
[9], we
the fractional integrals as approximation of the integrals on fractals [7].
proved that fractional integrals can be considered as integrals over the space with fractional
dimension up to numerical factor. To prove this statement, we use the well-known formulas
of dimensional regularizations [10].

In Ref.

We use the fractional integrals to describe fractal media. We consider the simple example
of application of fractal integrals to describe the fractal medium. We discuss the possible
experimental testing of the continuous medium model for fractal media that is suggested in
[12]. This test is connected with measure of period of the Maxwell pendulum with fractal
medium cylinder.

It is known that the homogeneous medium cylinder with mass M and the radius R such

that the medium of cylinder has the integer mass dimension, has the moments of inertia

where z is a cylinder axis. If the fractal medium cylinder has the mass M, radius R, and
the fractal mass dimension, then the moment of inertia has the form

(1)

where α is a fractal mass dimension of cross-section of the cylinder (1 < α ≤ 2). The
parameter α can be calculated by box counting method for the cross-section of the cylinder.
As the result, we get that two homogeneous cylinders with the same masses and ra-
diuses have the unequal moments of inertia. These cylinders have the diﬀerent properties as
Maxwell pendulums. The periods of oscillation for these pendulums are connected by the
equation

where T (α)
is a period of oscillation of fractal medium Maxwell pendulum. For example, the
experiment can be realized by using the sandstone cylinder. Note that Katz and Thompson
[5] presented experimental evidence indicating that the pore spaces of a set of sandstone
samples are fractals and are self-similar over three to four orders of magnitude in length
extending from 10 angstrom to 100 µm.

2 Fractal Media and Fractional Integrals

The cornerstone of fractals is the meaning of dimension, speciﬁcally the fractal dimension.
Fractal dimension can be best calculated by box counting method which means drawing a
box of size R and counting the mass inside. The mass fractal dimension [1, 11] can be easy
measured for fractal media. The properties of the fractal media like mass obeys a power law
relation

M ∼ RD,

(D < 3),

(2)

where M is the mass of fractal medium, R is a box size (or a sphere radius), and D is a
mass fractal dimension. Amount of mass of a medium inside a box of size R has a power
law relation (2).

The power law relation (2) can be naturally derived by using the fractional integral. In
Ref [12], we prove that the mass fractal dimension is connected with the order of fractional
integrals. Therefore the fractional integrals can be used to describe fractal media with non-
integer mass dimensions.

Let us consider the region WA in 3-dimensional Euclidean space E3, where A is the
midpoint of this region. The volume of the region WA is denoted by V (WA). If the region
WA is a ball with the radius RA, then the midpoint A is a center of the ball, and the volume
V (WA) = (4/3)πR3
A . The mass of the region WA in the fractal medium is denoted by
M(WA). The fractality of medium means that the mass of this medium in any region WA of
Euclidean space E3 increase more slowly that the volume of this region. For the ball region
of the fractal medium, this property can be described by the power law (2), where R is the
radius of the ball WA.

Fractal media are called homogeneous fractal media if the power law (2) does not depend
on the translation of the region. The homogeneity property of the medium can be formulated
in the form: For all regions WA and WB of the homogeneous fractal medium such that the
volumes are equal V (WA) = V (WB), we have that the masses of these regions are equal
M(WA) = M(WB). Note that the wide class of the fractal media satisﬁes the homogeneous
property. In many cases, we can consider the porous media [14, 15], polymers [16], colloid
aggregates [17], and aerogels [18] as homogeneous fractal media.

In Ref.

[12], the continuous medium model for the fractal media was suggested. Note

that the fractality and homogeneity properties can be realized in the following forms:

(1) Fractality: The mass of the ball region W of fractal medium obeys a power law relation

MD(W ) = M0

D

,

R
Rc (cid:17)

(cid:16)

(3)

where D < 3, R is the radius of the ball, and Rc is the characteristic value. In the general
case, we have the scaling law relation MD(λW ) = λDMD(W ), where λW = {λx, x ∈ W }.

(2) Homogeneity: The local density of homogeneous fractal media is translation invariant
value that have the form ρ(x) = ρ0 = const.

(6)

These requirements can be realized by the fractional generalization of the equation

Let us deﬁne the fractional integral in Euclidean space E3 in the Riesz form [19]. The
fractional generalization of Eq. (4) can be realized in the following form

M3(W ) =

ρ(x)dV3.

ZW

MD(W ) =

ρ(x)dVD,

ZW

c3(D, x) =

23−DΓ(3/2)
Γ(D/2)

|x|D−3.

where dVD = c3(D, x)dV3, and

Here we use the initial points in the fractional integrals are set to zero. The numerical factor
in Eq. (5) has this form in order to derive usual integral in the limit D → (3 − 0). Note that
the usual numerical factor γ−1
3 (D) = Γ(1/2)/2Dπ3/2Γ(D/2), which is used in Ref. [19] leads
to γ

−1
3 (3 − 0) = Γ(1/2)/23π3/2Γ(3/2) in the limit D → (3 − 0).
In order to have the usual dimensions of the physical values, we can use vector x, and
coordinates x, y, z as dimensionless values. For example, we can deﬁne x = x1/x0, y = x2/x0,
z = x3/x0, where x1, x2, and x3 are the coordinates with the usual physical dimension.

We can rewrite Eq. (5) in the form

If we consider the homogeneous fractal medium (ρ(x) = ρ0 = const) and the ball region

W = {x :

|x| ≤ R}, then we have

MD(W ) =

23−DΓ(3/2)
Γ(D/2)

ZW

ρ(x)|x|D−3d3x.

MD(W ) = ρ0

23−DΓ(3/2)
Γ(D/2)

ZW

|x|D−3dV3.

Using the spherical coordinates, we get

MD(W ) =

π25−DΓ(3/2)
Γ(D/2)

ρ0 ZW

|x|D−1d|x| =

25−DπΓ(3/2)
DΓ(D/2)

ρ0RD.

As the result, we have M(W ) ∼ RD, i.e., we derive Eq. (3) up to the numerical factor.
Therefore the fractal medium with non-integer mass dimension D can be described by frac-
tional integral of order D.

Note that the interpretation of the fractional integration is connected with fractional
dimension [9]. This interpretation follows from the well-known formulas for dimensional
regularizations [10]: The fractional integral can be considered as a integral in the fractional
dimension space up to the numerical factor Γ(D/2)/(2πD/2Γ(D)).

3 Moment of Inertia of Fractal Medium Cylinder

In this section, we consider the fractional generalization of the equation for moment of inertia.
The equation for the moment of inertia of homogeneous cylinder with integer mass di-

mension has the well-known form

Here z is the cylinder axis, and dS2 = dxdy. The fractional generalization of Eq. (7) for
moment of inertia can be deﬁned by the equation

The numerical factor in Eq. (8) has this form in order to derive usual integral in the limit
α → (2 − 0) and β → (1 − 0). The parameters α and β are

1 < α ≤ 2,

0 < β ≤ 1.

If α = 2 and β = 1, then Eq. (8) has form (7). The parameter α is a fractal mass dimension
of the cross-section of cylinder. This parameter can be easy calculated from the experimental
data. It can be calculated by box counting method for the cross-section of the cylinder.

Substituting Eq. (9) in Eq. (8), we get

Here we consider the cylindrical region W that is deﬁned by the relations

Using the cylindrical coordinates (φ, r, z), we have

dS2 = dxdy = rdrdφ,

(x2 + y2)α/2 = rα.

and α = 2.

If we consider the fractal medium cylinder with the mass and radius that are equal to

have ay = (2/3)g ≃ 6.54 (m/s2). The period T0 of oscillation for this Maxwell pendulum is

5 Conclusion

In the general case, the fractal media cannot be considered as continuous media. There are
points and domains that are not ﬁlled of the medium particles. In Ref. [12], we suggest to
consider the fractal media as special (”fractional”) continuous media. We use the procedure
of replacement of the medium with fractal mass dimension by some continuous medium
that is described by fractional integrals. This procedure is a fractional generalization of
Christensen approach [6]. Suggested procedure leads to the fractional integration and diﬀer-
entiation to describe fractal media. The fractional integrals are considered as approximation
of the integrals on fractals [8]. Note that fractional integrals can be considered as integrals
over the space with fractional dimension up to numerical factor [9, 20, 22]. To prove we use
the well-known formulas of dimensional regularizations [10]. The fractional integrals allow
us to take into account the fractality of the media.

The fractional continuous models of fractal media can have a wide application. This
is due in part to the relatively small numbers of parameters that deﬁne a random fractal
medium of great complexity and rich structure. In many cases, the real fractal structure of
matter can be disregarded and the medium can be replaced by some ”fractional” continu-
ous mathematical model. In order to describe the media with non-integer mass dimension,
we must use the fractional calculus. Smoothing of the microscopic characteristics over the
physically inﬁnitesimal volume transform the initial fractal medium into ”fractional” con-
tinuous model that uses the fractional integrals. The order of fractional integral is equal to
the fractal mass dimension of the medium. The fractional continuous model allows us to
describe dynamics for wide class fractal media [13, 21, 23].

In this Letter we consider the simple experiment that allows us to prove the fractional
continuous media model [12] for fractal media. This simple experiment prove that the
fractional integrals can be used to describe fractal media.

The fractal medium cylinder with the mass M, radius R, and the fractal mass dimension,

has the moment of inertia in the form

where α is a fractal mass dimension of cross-section of the cylinder (1 < α ≤ 2). The
parameter α can be calculated by box counting method for the cross-section of the cylinder.
As the result, we get that two homogeneous cylinders with equal masses and radiuses can have
the unequal moments of inertia. These cylinders have the diﬀerent properties as Maxwell
pendulums. The periods of oscillation for these pendulums are connected by the equation

0

where T (α)
is a period of oscillation of fractal medium Maxwell pendulum. For example,
the experiment can be realized by using the sandstone. Note that Katz and Thompson [5]
presented experimental evidence indicating that the pore spaces of a set of sandstone samples
are fractals and are self-similar over three to four orders of magnitude in length extending

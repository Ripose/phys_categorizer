Ideal Constraints - A Warning Note

2

Constraints are restrictions that limit the motion of the particles of a system.
The forces necessary to constrain the motion are said to be forces of constraint. The
constraints whose unknown forces of constraint can be eliminated are called ideal
constraints. The principle of virtual work and D’Alambert’s principle are of paramount
importance in pedagogical presentations of analytical mechanics because they are readily
derived from Newton’s laws and because they enable us to get rid of the unknown forces
of constraint from the equations of motion as well. Furthermore, these principles are
starting points for obtaining Lagrange’s equations of motion. To obtain the principle
of virtual work and D’Alambert’s principle textbook’s authors quite generally consider
the virtual work done on a system of N particles:

δW =

N

X
i=1

~F (e)

i

· δ~ri +

N

X
i=1

~fi · δ~ri

i

where the force on each particle is written as the externally applied force ~F (e)
plus
the force of constraint ~fi. The principle of virtual work is applied only to static
problems whereas D’Alambert’s principle is applied to dynamical situations. The
diﬀerence between these principles is not highlighted in this note neither is relevant to
the discussion which follows because the attention is focused on the desembarrassment
of the unwanted forces of constraint. Hauser [1] argues that “If the δ~ri’s are chosen
so that any constraints which exist between the coordinates of the particles are satisﬁed,
the constraint forces ~fi acting on the particles will be perpendicular to the displacements
δ~ri.” Similarly Lanczos [2] argues that “The vanishing of this scalar product means that
the force ~fi is perpendicular to any possible virtual displacement.” Taylor [3] also argues
that “One thing known about otherwise unknown forces of constraint and that is that they
always act at right angles to any conceivable displacement consistent with the constraint
under the condition of “stopped time”, i.e., to any virtual displacement.” In the same
line of reasoning Chow [4] claims that “Most of the constraints that commonly occur,
such as sliding motion on a frictionless surface and rolling contact without slipping, do
no work under a virtual displacement, that is

~fi · δ~ri = 0

(4.8)

This is practically the only possible situation we can imagine where the forces of
constraint must be perpendicular to δ~ri; otherwise, the system could be spontaneously
accelerated by the forces of constraint alone, and we know that this does not occur...”.

Indeed, the statements cited above hold for a system consisting of just one particle.
Nevertheless, there is no compelling reason to believe that they are true for a system
with more than one particle, and they are not indeed. Let us illustrate this point with
two very instructive and traditional problems: the rigid body and the Atwood machine.
A rigid body is a system of particles connected in such a way that the distance
between any two particles is invariable. Newton’s third law implies that for any pair of
particles the forces of constraint are equals and opposites and besides they are parallel
to the relative position vector, whatever the virtual displacements. These facts ensure
that the net virtual work of the forces of constraint vanishes.

In the Atwood machine two particles are connected by an inextensible string passing
over a pulley. If the string and the pulley are massless and the motion is frictionless then
the forces of constraint will reduce to the tension in the string. The virtual displacements
of the particles compatible with the constraint will be in the vertical direction and so will
the forces of constraint. The virtual works of the forces of constraint on each particle
are the same, unless a sign, ensuring that the net virtual work done by the forces of
constraint vanishes.

It is worthwhile to observe that the conclusions obtained through the former
examples do not depend of the state of movement of the particles, i.e., if it is a static
or a dynamical problem, in this way such conclusions are suitable to the principle of
virtual work as well as to D’Alambert’s principle.

From the previous two examples one can drawn the lesson that in order to eliminate

the forces of constraint is solely required that the net virtual work vanishes:

N

X
i=1

~fi · δ~ri = 0

This less restrictive condition allows forces of constraint not perpendicular to δ~ri, for
systems with more than one particle, without implying in spontaneous accelerated
motion.

In short, there is absolutely no need for resorting to erroneous restrictions on the
forces of constraint, as those ones presented by Hauser, Lanczos, Taylor and Chow, in or-
der to eliminate them from the analytical formulations of the classical mechanics. Ideal
constraints are those which the net virtual work on the entire system is zero whatever
the relative orientation among the forces of constraint and the virtual displacements.
This proviso is suﬃcient enough to ensure that the system is not spontaneously accel-
erated.

In 1892 H.A. Lorentz started the search for a classical equation of motion
for pointlike charged particles that takes into account the radiation reaction
force. This search culminated in the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation of
motion, which is not satisfactory since it exhibits self-acceleration causing
runaway solutions. In spite of ongoing eﬀorts for more than a century, there
is yet no acceptable classical equation of motion for a pointlike charge, cf. the
recent paper by Rohrlich [1] and the comments about his proposal [2, 3,
4]. So, it is still an open question how to augment continuous classical
electrodynamics with the physical concept of pointlike charged particles. The
pointlike charge is presently only a common and handy computational device,
which we generalized by the expansions in terms of co-moving moments of
time-dependent, moving charges and currents [5].

This open question suggests that our present understanding of classical
electrodynamics is actually not as complete as is usually taken for granted.
There are actually many serious conceptual ﬂaws and crack in our under-
standing of the consequences of electromagnetic forces between electric charges
and currents.

To faciliate the search for an equation of motion for a pointlike charge,

in our monograph [6] we:

• clariﬁed the issues by concisely formulating this open question,

• gave a systematic collection of conditions which prospective equations
have to meet, and of physical properties they are desired to possess,
and

• gathered and collated various theoretical concepts and results which
might be useful and relevant to anyone interested in discussing and
proposing answers to this open question of theoretical physics.

To this end we considered about 80 references from 1903 to 1989 where some
of the ideas, concepts, conclusions or formulae analogous or relevant to those
considered in our monograph may be found.

To obtain an equation of motion, generalizing Schott [7] we introduced
the acceleration four-momentum B implicitely deﬁned by the relativistic dif-
ferential energy-momentum balance equation

˙β − ( ˙β · ˙β)β + τ0γdB/dt = f ,

(1)

(i) β = (γ, γv/c), with γ = (1 − |v/c|)−1/2, is the four-velocity
where:
of the pointlike charge; (ii) ˙β = τ0γdβ/dt, is the acceleration four-vector,
with τ0 = q2/6πǫ0mc3, q and m being the pointlike charge charge and mass,
respectively; (iii) f = (τ0/mc)γ(v · F/c, F) is the external four-force, with F
being the external force acting on the pointlike charge.

If the acceleration four-momentum B is explicitly known and depends
solely on the external four-force f and four-momentum β but not on its
derivatives, relation (1) could be used as a Newtonian equation of motion; and
for B = − ˙β, it is just the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac equation. We pointed out
sixteen qualitative properties that a general equation of motion for pointlike
charged particles ought to possess [6, 2]; in particular, it has to have more
than two free parameters, with unforeseeable mathematical implications.

Furthermore, we proposed a conceptually new mathematical model—
diﬀerential relations describing the asymptotic behaviour of trajectories of
classical pointlike charged particles in response to a small and slowly chang-
ing external force fext = ωF (ωt), ω > 0 [8, 6]. They take account of radiation,
and of Dirac’s and Bhabha’s conditions about conservation of energy and lin-
ear momentum, and of angular and boost momenta. We can use them for
describing, investigating and evaluating the dynamic behaviour of classical
pointlike charged particles in response to a small and slowly changing external
force to any desired order of ω. But we can not use these diﬀerential rela-
tions as equations of motion for computing their trajectories; though we may
transform each of them into an appropriate Newtonian equation of motion

accurate up to the same order of ω. We proposed that the Lorentz-Abraham-
Dirac equation is not an equation of motion for computing trajectories, but
just a diﬀerential relation of order ω2, the lowest order that still takes account
of radiation.

This work builds on the Volterra series formalism presented in [D. W.
Dreisigmeyer and P. M. Young, J. Phys. A 36, 8297, (2003)] to model
nonconservative systems. Here we treat Lagrangians and actions as ‘time
dependent’ Volterra series. We present a new family of kernels to be used
in these Volterra series that allow us to derive a single retarded equation of
motion using a variational principle.

Abstract

1 Introduction

The central question addressed in this paper is:
‘How can one have a single
retarded equation of motion arise from the use of a variational principle?’ Having
a dissipative equation of motion arise from the use of a variational principle has a
rather long history in mechanics. One of the central results in this area is Bauer’s
1931 corollary [3]:

Corollary 1.1 The equations of motion of a dissipative linear dynamical system
with constant coefﬁcients are not given by a variational principle.

Bauer’s proof of this corollary relies on two implicit assumptions. First, there
are no extra equations of motion that arise. Also, only integer ordered derivative
operators are used in the action and Lagrangian. It is the latter assumption that we
will eventually take advantage of to avoid Bauer’s corollary.

There has been some effort devoted to bypassing Bauer’s result. One of the
earliest attempts was by Bateman [2]. What he did was allow a dual equation of
motion to arise. Let us illustrate this via the dissipative harmonic oscillator. If we
start with the Lagrangian

L = m ˙x ˙y +

(x ˙y − ˙xy) − mω2xy,

C
2

where C is a constant, we would have the following equations of motion

m¨x + C ˙x + mω2x = 0
m¨y − C ˙y + mω2y = 0 .

(1)

(2)
(3)

Equation (2) is what we want for our harmonic oscillator (i.e., it is retarded or
causal). Equation (3) is a time reversed version of (2). Bateman’s method is not
particularly general. Also, the appearance of an advanced (time reversed or anti-
causal) equation can be considered a drawback to this procedure. Our universe
appears to be causal so there does not seem to be any compelling reason why
anti-causal effects should arise from any correct action.

A rather novel attempt to get around Bauer’s corollary was explored by Riewe
in a series of papers [9, 10]. Riewe tried using fractional derivatives in the action to
have nonconservative equations arise. In particular, Riewe did not use Bateman’s

2

method of having an anti-causal dual equation. However, Riewe’s equations of
motion are acausal. In order to circumvent this, it was suggested that all anti-causal
operators be replaced with their causal counterparts. (Riewe’s method is rather
involved so we do not provide any illustrative examples.) This procedure does
allow for much more general equations than Bateman’s method. However, it must
be remembered that the actual equations derived are acausal and the procedure to
change these into causal equations is rather ad hoc.

In examining Riewe’s approach, Dreisigmeyer and Young showed that his
procedure of replacing anti-causal with causal operations may not be a wise idea
[6]. While still employing fractional derivatives, Dreisigmeyer and Young instead
allowed for a causal equation and an anti-causal dual equation to arise. Thus, their
procedure can be considered a generalization of Bateman’s. The appearance of
an anti-causal equation is still very troublesome. Since both [9, 10] and [6] deal
with fractional derivatives, we will later refer to these techniques as fractional
mechanics.

There are some other approaches to our basic problem. Tonti [13] and Arthurs
and Jones [1] did develop a procedure based on the convolution product that is
useful for the harmonic oscillator. However, this does not seem to generalize to
higher ordered potentials. So we need to question if this is the correct procedure to
follow. Caldeira and Leggett [4] modelled nonconservative systems by coupling
them to an environment. The environment is modelled as a collection of harmonic
oscillators which results in the Lagrangian

L =

˙q2 − V (q) +

(cid:27)

(4)

where q is the system’s coordinate and the qn are the environment’s coordinates.
Here the combined system and environment is conservative while the system
alone may be dissipative. This procedure allows for the introduction of very
general dissipation terms into the system’s equation of motion. For example,
fractional derivatives can be included. However, the microscopic modelling of the
environment makes (4) rather complicated. In particular, we would generally have
a countably inﬁnite system of equations resulting from (4). Also, the question of
causality is ‘put off’ to the end. That is, we enforce causality in q’s equation of
motion by only using the causal solutions of the qn’s equations of motion. In other
words, we assume the environment acts causally only when we are solving it’s
equations of motion. While this is not particularly disturbing, it does mean that
causality is not necessarily enforced in the action.

3

In [6] the idea of treating the actions and Lagrangians as Volterra series was
introduced. (Volterra series are the generalization to functionals of the power series
concept.) This is a rather powerful framework. It allows us to build up Lagrangians
(and hence actions) in a rather systematic way by tailoring the kernels in the Volterra
series to our requirements. As originally stated, we desire to derive a single causal
equation of motion for a system. We will accomplish this by choosing the correct
family of kernels for our Volterra series. Our paper is organized as follows. We
In
review the distributional approach to fractional differentiation in section 2.
section 3 we introduce Volterra series. Our variational principle is developed in
section 4. A discussion of our results and possible future research follows in
section 5.

2 Fractional derivatives

We will now brieﬂy review fractional derivatives using the distributional approach.
(A fuller discussion of this material can be found in [6, 7, 8].) First, deﬁne the
generalized functions

and

Φ+

α (t) =

1

Γ(α) tα−1
0

(cid:26)

t > 0
t ≤ 0

Φ−

α (t) =

1

Γ(α) |t|α−1
0

(cid:26)

t < 0
t ≥ 0

where Γ(α) is the gamma function. These distributions will allow us to deﬁne
two different types of fractional derivatives. One of these will be causal while the
other will be anti-causal. The anti-causal derivatives need to be avoided in our
equations of motion.

Left fractional derivatives (LFDs) of order α of a function q(t) are deﬁned by

Dα

t [q]

a

:= Φ+
−α(t) ∗ q(t)
1
Γ(−α) Z
a

=

t

q(τ )(t − τ )−(α+1) dτ

where we set q(t) ≡ 0 for t < a. For α = n, n an integer, (7) becomes

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

Dn

t [q] = Dnq

a

4

where D is the generalized derivative. The LFDs are causal operations. Hence,
we will only want LFDs to be in our equations of motion.

Right fractional derivatives (RFDs) of order α are given by

(9)

(10)

Dα

b [q]

t

:= Φ−
−α(t) ∗ q(t)
1
Γ(−α) Z

=

b

t

q(τ )(τ − t)−(α+1) dτ

where now q(t) ≡ 0 for t > b. Notice that instead of (8), we have

Dn

b [q] = (−1)nDnq .

t

The RFDs are anti-causal operations. So, we do not want the RFDs to appear in
our equations of motion.

The basic problem for fractional mechanics is to avoid the appearance of
RFDs in the equations of motion. Neither Riewe [9, 10] nor Dreisigmeyer and
Young [6] were able to remove RFDs completely. Riewe suggested replacing
RFDs with LFDs in the resulting equations of motion. Dreisigmeyer and Young
suggested letting the LFDs appear in one equation while the RFDs appeared in a
dual equation. Neither of these methods is entirely satisfactory. We will shortly
present a formalism that completely avoids RFDs. Before that, let us look at
Volterra series.

3 Volterra Series

Now we are going to develop some of the Volterra series concepts that we will need.
Our treatment of Volterra series here is somewhat different than that presented in
[6]. Here we treat Volterra series as expansions of (generalized) functions that
depend on time. This is the viewpoint adopted in the nonlinear systems theory that
is somewhat popular in electrical engineering (see, e.g., [11]). In [6] the Volterra
series were treated as expansions of functionals only (i.e., no time dependence).
This change in viewpoint will make all the difference in achieving our goal of a
single causal equation of motion.

For completeness let us ﬁrst review the Volterra series treatment in [6], see
also [12]. (Please note, we will not review the fractional mechanics formalism

5

developed by Dreisigmeyer and Young in this paper since this will be largely
irrelevant for our current work and also take us too far aﬁeld.)
In [6] only
functionals were treated as (time independent) Volterra series. For some functional
V[q] deﬁne the kernels

K (s)

n (τ1, . . . , τn)

:=

δnV[q]
δq(τ1) · · · δq(τn)

.

(11)

Notice that the K (s)
example, K (s)

2 (τ1, τ2) = K (s)

n (·)’s are symmetric under an interchange of the τi’s. For

2 (τ2, τ1). Now introduce the convenient notation

K (s)

n ⋆ qn

:=

· · ·

Zτ1

Zτn

K (s)

n (τ1, . . . , τn)q(τn) · · · q(τ1) dτn · · · dτ1.

(12)

Then we can represent the functional V[q] as the Volterra series

V[q] =

K (s)

n ⋆ qn.

(13)

∞

Xn=1

1
n!

The V[q] were taken as the actions in [6]. (This is why we can take K (s)
0 = V[0] ≡ 0
in (13) without any loss of generality). This use of Volterra series proves to be too
restrictive [5]. So let us use a more ‘dynamic’ form of the Volterra series concept.

Instead of expanding the actions in Volterra series like (13), we will now

expand the Lagrangians in Volterra series like [11]

where the ⋆ notation is as in (12) and the Kn(τ ) will now be of the form

L[q; τ ] =

Kn(τ ) ⋆ qn

∞

Xn=1

1
n!

Kn(τ ) = Kn(τ, τ1, . . . , τn).

(14)

(15)

(We assume that K0(τ ) ≡ 0 in (14).) We call a kernel Kn(τ, τ1, . . . , τn) symmetric
if it is symmetric under any interchange of the τi, i = 1, . . . , n. A kernel is called
stationary if there exists a kernel κn(ξ1, . . . , ξn) such that

κn(τ − τ1, . . . , τ − τn) = Kn(τ, τ1, . . . , τn)

(16)

for all τ, τ1, . . . , τn.

6

The L[q, τ ] will generally be τ -dependent distributions that also depend on the
function q. So, in a sense, the Lagrangians can also be viewed as τ -dependent
functionals. Hence the notation L[q; τ ] used in (14). This is also why we allow
the extra τ to appear in (15) versus (11).

From (14) we will form the actions

V[q; t] =

L[q; τ ] dτ.

(17)

t

Z

a

The actions given by (17) are t-dependent Volterra series. So they can be thought
of as distributions or t-dependent functionals as the Lagrangians were. It is also
useful to view the actions as the anti-derivatives of the Lagrangians.

Our entire problem can now be succinctly stated: ‘Find the correct kernels
Kn(τ, τ1, . . . , τn) to use in (14).’ The Volterra series framework helps clarify the
problem of deriving a single causal equation of motion.
It reduces the whole
question to that of ﬁnding a correct family of kernels for our Volterra series. Our
attention now turns to this problem.

4 Causal fractional Lagrangian mechanics

Systems and control theorists tend to be obsessed with the question of causality. So
it seems somewhat natural that the theory and formalism of causal Volterra series
reached its highest development due to the work of (mathematically oriented)
electrical engineers. This is probably best expressed by the book written by Rugh
[11]. We are now going to apply this previous research to analytic mechanics. We
will see that enforcing causality in the Lagrangians will result in causal equations
of motion. By now we should see that the key to deriving purely causal equations
of motion is to ﬁnd the correct kernels for our Volterra series. What we will do in
this section is introduce a new family of kernels to be used in our Volterra series.
We then examine these kernels to model the nonconservative harmonic oscillator.
Next, a driving force is added on. Finally, higher ordered potentials are dealt with.

First, let us deﬁne the symmetric and stationary kernels

for n ≥ 1, where, in (18) and (19), τi ≤ τ for i = 1, . . . , n and

,

(19)

(20)

n(τ ) and the rλ

(It is interesting to compare the distributions in (18) and (19) with the rλ examined
in [7].) The restrictions on the τi should be viewed as part of the deﬁnitions of
the Rλ
n(τ ). Requiring that τi ≤ τ is what will give us our causality.
At ﬁrst sight the distributions in (18) and (19) appear to have nothing to do with
the fractional derivative operators Φ±
α (τ ) presented in section 2. This will prove
to not be the case presently.

The easiest case to deal with is the nonconservative harmonic oscillator, which

we examine now. Consider the Lagrangian

LHO[q; τ ] =

mR−2

2 (τ ) + mCR

−γ
2 (τ ) + mω2R0

2(τ )

⋆ q2

(21)

(cid:3)

1
2

(cid:2)

where 0 < γ < 2 and C is a constant. Remember that the Lagrangian is a τ -
dependent Volterra series that will be treated as a distribution. From (21) we form
the action

VHO[q; t]

:=

LHO[q; τ ] dτ.

(22)

In (22) we take q(τi) ≡ 0 for ti < a. This implies that L[q; τ ] ≡ 0 for τ < a
in (21) since the Lagrangian in (21) is causal. Also, the action in (22) is a t-
dependent Volterra series. Remember that we think of V[q; t] in (22) as being the
anti-derivative of L[q; τ ] in (21).

In (21) and (22) we should think of τ as being ‘now’. When we derive our
equations of motion shortly, we will vary the q(τi) in (22). When we do this, we
always consider the perturbations of q(τi) as happening ‘now’, i.e.,

q(τi) −→ q(τi) + hδ(τ − τi)

motion. The above can also be extended to R−λ
2 (τ ) where λ > 2. So, derivatives
of arbitrary order of q(τ ) can be included in (21).

So how did the restriction τi ≤ τ result in the causality in (25)? Consider the

quantity

where q(τ ) ≡ 0 for τ < a. Hence, the restrictions on the τi allows us to have the
Dλ

τ [q] arise from the use of the R−λ
Driving forces need to be handled somewhat differently than the potential or
kinetic energy terms. This is perhaps not surprising since a driving term is, in
a sense, outside the ‘universe’ we are modelling. Let us consider the q(τ ) as
our system that moves through some environment described by the kernels in our
Volterra series. So the Volterra series includes both our system and environment.

9

The driving term is neither of these. We could of course expand our view of what
the environment or system are to include those mechanisms that give rise to the
driving force. This, however, may overly complicate matters. Instead, we will
proceed as follows for, e.g., the driven nonconservative harmonic oscillator. Let
our new Lagrangians be given by

′

L

[q; τ ] = LHO[q; τ ] −

f (τ1)q(τ1) dτ1.

(28)

Things proceed as before. So our action is given by

So now we can include driving forces, higher ordered potentials and derivatives
of arbitrary order in our Lagrangians. We are also able to derive purely causal
equations of motion by using the kernels in (18) in our Lagrangians. A general
Lagrangian will be given by

results in a fractional diffeo-integral equation of motion.

5 Discussion

We have presented a rather general method to model nonconservative systems.
There are two key observations that allowed this to be possible. The main point
was to ﬁnd the correct form for the Volterra series expansion of the Lagrangians
L[q; τ ]. This form is given in (42).
In particular, allowing the Volterra series
kernels to depend on the ‘extra’ parameter τ allowed us to get around Bauer’s
corollary [3] and the result of Dreisigmeyer and Young in [5]. Because of this
expanded deﬁnition of the allowed kernels, we were able to ﬁnd the Rλ
n(τ ) that met
our requirement for a causal equation of motion. That is, we abandoned using the
fractional derivative kernels Φ±
α (τ ) in our Lagrangians and actions, as in [6]. This
is the second observation that allowed us to achieve our goal of a single retarded
equation of motion.

There are a few areas of future research that would be interesting to pursue in
relation to this paper. Let us initially list the more mathematical of these. First, are
the Rλ
n(τ ) the only kernels that allow us to derive the correct equations of motion?
We have not proved that they are in this paper so, there may be other, more
appropriate kernels to use. Also, it would be nice to have a rigorous exploration
of the ‘generalized convolution’ operation that appears in the L[q; τ ] and V[q; t].
While we treated both the Lagrangians and the actions as distributions, this still
needs to be given a ﬁrm mathematical foundation. Finally, we have only let λ ∈ R

12

and n = 2, 3, . . . in the Rλ
n(τ ). In fact, for n 6= 2 only λ = 0 was allowed. It would
be interesting to extend this to arbitrary λ ∈ R and n ≥ 2. Allowing λ ∈ R for
any n = 2, 3, . . . is relatively straightforward. Allowing for fractional dimensions,
e.g., n ≥ 2 with n ∈ R, is a more difﬁcult and interesting question.

For physics, the central problem is probably to develop a Hamiltonian formu-
lation that corresponds to our Lagrangian one. Also, it would be interesting to
examine what effects special relativity may have in our formalism. Finally, the
question of quantization, via, say, the path integral, is also open. All of these areas
of research may cast light on the question of whether the Rλ
n(τ ) are the correct, or
only, kernels to use in our Lagrangians.

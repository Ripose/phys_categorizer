Abstract

The following inverse problem is discussed. A static electromagnetic ﬁeld generated by a limited system
of charges and currents is supposed to be known with its ﬁrst derivatives at a point somewhere far from the
system. This allows to reconstruct the position of the system, its net charge, and the electric and magnetic
moments of the system.

1 Statement of the problem.

By the inverse problem of electrodynamics we mean the problem of reconstructing the charge and current
densities from the known electromagnetic ﬁeld they create. Obviously, the solution of the inverse problem of
electrodynamics depends substantially on the presence of materials, the region in which the electromagnetic
ﬁeld is speciﬁed, ets. It is well known that the value of an analytic function and all its derivatives at some point
allow to reconstruct the value of the function in the domain of deﬁnition by use of the Taylor series. Applied
to the electrostatic inverse problem it means that if we know the value of electromagnetic ﬁeld in some point
and all its derivatives at this point, we can reconstruct the ﬁeld in the whole space. Furthermore, the Maxwell
equations allow to calculate the charge and current density functions ρ(r) and j(r) respectively:

ρ(r) =

div E(r)

j(r) =

rot H (r).

Here E(r) is the electric ﬁeld and H (r) is the magnetic ﬁeld.

In actual practice we are able to measure the ﬁeld and only few ﬁrst derivatives with an inevitable error. This
means that we can reconstruct the ﬁeld only in a small vicinity around the point where the ﬁeld is measured.
But the real problem encountered in practice is to calculate the ﬁeld and charge distribution far from the point
where the ﬁeld is measured. In order to do it we have to know the value of ﬁeld and its derivatives up to a very
high order and with high accuracy. We present here another approach based on the multipole expansion of the
ﬁeld far from the static collection of charges and currents.

Suppose we know the value of electric E and magnetic H ﬁelds at some point far from limited system of
charges and currents. We know also the ﬁrst derivatives of ﬁelds Eij = ∂Ei/∂xj and Hij = ∂Hi/∂xj. There is
to deﬁne the charge q, the electric d and magnetic m dipole moments of the distant electromagnetic system,
and the location r of the system. Let the coordinate origin be at the point where the ﬁelds are deﬁned. We
start with the well known formula for the ﬁelds of electric and magnetic dipoles [1, 2]

where δij is the Kronecker symbol. One can see from Eqs. (1.3) and (1.4) that the tensors Eij and Hij are
symmetrical. This follows also from the Maxwell equations, namely from rot E = 0 and rot H = 0. Besides,
the Maxwell equations div E = 0 and div H = 0 give

E11 + E22 + E33 = 0 H11 + H22 + H33 = 0

We consider expressions (1.1) – (1.4) as a set of equations in 10 scalar unknowns q, r, d and m. But this set
consist of 16 equations with regard to the conditions (1.5), and symmetry of the tensors Eij and Hij. This
allows us to formulate the inverse problem in more general sence. Namely, we can consider ﬁelds E and H as
being originated by diﬀerent sources. Let us denote by rq the radius-vector of a charge collection with a total
charge q and an electric dipole moment d, and by rm the radius-vector of a system of currents with a magnetic
dipole moment m. Then the set of equations (1.1) – (1.4) splits into two independent sets for rq and rm. In
solving these equations we can obtain in particular rq = rm, which means that the electric ﬁeld E and magnetic
ﬁeld H are generated by the same electromagnetic system.

It should be pointed out, that in calculation of ﬁelds far from an electromagnetic system we can neglect the
higher terms of multipole expansion. The accuracy of such representation depends on the ratio between the
sizes of the system and the distance between the system and observer. In solving the inverse problem we ﬁnd
only the distance |r|, but not the sizes of system. In order to estimate the accuracy of the received solution one
have to calculate the sizes of the system by some independent method. For example one can solve the inverse
problem for a few diﬀerent positions of the observer and then one can estimate the sizes of the system. One
can also investigate the ﬁeld in the vicinity of the observer in order to ﬁnd out whether this ﬁeld is of dipole
nature. These problems are not considered in this paper. In order to exclude such questions we consider further
a point-like charge with an electric dipole moment and a point-like magnetic moment. In the next two sections
we solve the inverse problem ﬁrst for the equations (1.1) and (1.3) and then for equations (1.2) and (1.4).

2 Inverse problem for a charge and electric dipole.

Let us solve the equations (1.1) and (1.3) with respect to the unknown q, d and r1. We choose the coordinate
system as follows: the coordinate origin is placed at the point where the ﬁeld is speciﬁed, the x axis is directed
along the vector E and the y axis is aligned with the principal normal to the electric ﬁeld line. The vector of
the principal normal n is deﬁned by the equality [3]

where k is the curvature of the ﬁeld line and ∂s is the displacement along the ﬁeld line. Taking derivative from
E we ﬁnd

where D = (E∇)E with the projections Di = EkEik (a summation over repeated indices is implied). The
projections of the vector n on the axes of an arbitrary orthogonal coordinate system are expressed in terms of
components of the tensor Eij as follows:

n =

1
kE

∂E
∂s

n =

1
kE4 [E[DE]]

If the x axis is directed in the sense of the vector E, then

ni =

kE4 EkEj(EjEik − EiEkj).

n =

{0, E12, E13}.

(2.1)

With the y axis directed in the sense of the vector n we have E13 = 0 and E12 > 0. It can be seen from Eq.
(1.1) that the vectors E, d and r lie in the same plane; therefore, the problem is reduced to a two-dimensional

one. In the x, y, z coordinate system we have E = (E, 0, 0), d = (dx, dy, 0), and E23 = 0 as a consequence of
the axial symmetry of the ﬁeld. Thus, ﬁve functions of the coordinates Ex, Ey, E11, E12 and E33 are known.
They can be used to ﬁnd ﬁve unknowns q, dx, dy, r1 and r2. Eqs.(1.1) and (1.3) in the (x, y) plane take the
form

Let us introduce the designations

In order to calculate the dipole moment, we ﬁnd the squared radius-vector r.

The sign ± in the formulas indicates the existence of two solutions of the initial system of equations (2.2-2.6).
Physically this means that the same ﬁeld with its derivatives may be created at the given point by two diﬀerent
sources located at diﬀerent places. One can ﬁnd some speciﬁc cases of this solution in Ref. [4].

3 Inverse problem for a magnetic dipole moment.

In order to ﬁnd the position vector r and the magnetic moment m of a particle generating the ﬁeld H we solve
equations (1.2) and (1.4). Now we align the axis x along the vector H and the axis y along the principal normal
to the magnetic ﬁeld line. Repeating the reasoning of the previous section we get

Thus, we have 5 equations for 4 unknowns. Hence, the system of equations (3.1) – (3.5) is a overdetermined
one. It means that the components of H and Hij are not independent. The fact that the ﬁeld H is produced
by a magnetic moment places a constraint on H and Hij. The corresponding equation will be found latter (see
Eq. (3.18)). Substituting (rm) from Eq. (3.5) into Eqs. (3.1) – (3.4), we ﬁnd

ﬁnd

Let us consider the speciﬁc case H33 = 0. It follows from Eq. (3.5) that (rm) = 0, which gives immediately

x = 0. Eqs. (3.1) – (3.4) give the whole solution in this case

Thus, Eqs. (3.13) – (3.16) and in particular case Eq. (3.17) give the solution of the problem.

It was mentioned above that the system of Eqs. (3.1) – (3.5) is a overdetermined one. Let us ﬁnd relation

between H and Hij. On the one hand it follows from Eq. (3.12) that

In case H33 = 0 we have from Eqs. (3.1) – (3.5) H11 = 0.

If the condition (3.18) is not fulﬁlled, the ﬁeld H is not produced by a magnetic dipole.

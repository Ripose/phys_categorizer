Introduction

In this thesis we use renormalization group methods to study the critical be-
haviour of the staggered F-model. The staggered F-model, deﬁned in chapter
2, can be used as a model of a facet of a BCC crystal in the (100) direction.

We ﬁrst use known exact results to map the staggered F-model to a sine-
Gordon type model (deﬁned in section 3.1), and study the renormalization group
equations for this model using momentum shell integration techniques. The map
to the sine-Gordon model is constructed using an exact result on the long range
part of the height-height correlation function of the F-model (i.e. the staggered
F-model at zero staggered ﬁeld) [40]. The results we obtain are the phase
diagram of the staggered F-model and the leading singularity in the free energy.
To get more results, e.g. the next to leading singularity in the free energy, we
need a larger source of information than is available in the form of the long range
part of the height-height correlation function. It turns out that the free fermion
method, upon which Baxter’s original solution is based, is ﬂexible enough to
admit a perturbative expansion about the free fermion line. By calculating the
singular part of the free energy perturbatively about the free fermion line, one
can construct a map from the staggered F-model to the sine-Gordon model
by demanding that it correctly reproduces the singular part of the free energy.
The idea thus is to use the mapping to the sine-Gordon type model as an
extrapolation technique. To make this approach practical we:

1. Develop in chapter 3 a simple diagrammatic method to ﬁnd the renormal-
ization group equations for a given sine-Gordon type model. This method
is based on a combination of functional Feynman rules and the operator
product expansion.

2. Rewrite in section 5.9 the perturbative expansion about the free fermion

line as a linked cluster expansion.

Although these two results make it possible to construct a map to a sine-Gordon
type model in a systematic way, the actual construction of this map is beyond
the scope of this thesis. We do, however, explicitly calculate the ﬁrst order
correction to Baxter’s result. This allows us to verify results which previously
could only be obtained using renormalization group arguments.

1.1 Summary

In chapter 2 we introduce the staggered F-model and discuss the equivalence

with the BCSOS model.

In chapter 3 a systematic renormalization group method is derived. In this
chapter we also discuss the application of the renormalization group in
the calculation of critical exponents.

In chapter 4 we obtain the phase diagram of the staggered F-model and cal-
culate the leading singularity in the free energy by using the information
present in the form of the asymptotic form of the height-height correlation
function

In chapter 5 we ﬁrst present a derivation of Baxter’s exact solution. We then
perturbatively lift the free fermion condition. This allows one to write the
free energy of the staggered F-model as a perturbative expansion about
the free fermion line. Baxter’s exact solution can thus be seen as the zeroth
order term in this expansion. We explicitely calculate the ﬁrst order term.
To facilitate the computation of the higher order terms we derive a linked
cluster method in section 5.9.

Chapter 2

Deﬁnition of the staggered
F-model

In this chapter we shall introduce the six-vertex model, of which the staggered
F-model is a special case. Some known results are discussed.

2.1 The six-vertex model

The six-vertex model can be deﬁned as follows: place arrows on the bonds of
a square lattice so that there are two arrows pointing into each vertex. Six
types of vertices can arise (hence the name of the model). These vertices are
shown in ﬁg. 2.1. By giving each vertex-type a (position-dependent) energy
the model is deﬁned. These models were ﬁrst introduced to study ferroelectric
systems. Later it was shown that six-vertex models can be mapped to solid-on-
solid (SOS) models [6]. Only a few of these models can be solved exactly. These
include the free fermion models [8, 39] and models that can can be solved using
a (generalized) Bethe Ansatz [4, 5, 21–23]. To deﬁne the staggered F-model, we
divide the lattice into two sublattices A and B, such that the nearest neighbor
of an A vertex is a B vertex. The vertex energies are chosen as indicated in
ﬁg. 2.1. When the the staggered ﬁeld (s) vanishes the model reduces to the
F-model, which has been solved by Lieb [22]. For nonzero staggered ﬁeld the
model can be solved when βǫ = 1

2 ln (2) [3].

Figure 2.2: An arrow conﬁguration together with the corresponding height function.

2.2 Six-vertex models and SOS models

We now proceed to show how six-vertex models are related to SOS models.
First we introduce a dual lattice. Each bond of the dual lattice now crosses an
arrow placed on one of the bonds of the original lattice. By rotating this arrow
90◦ clockwise and placing it on the corresponding bond of the dual lattice, we
obtain an arrow conﬁguration on the dual lattice. A height function (h) is now
deﬁned by demanding that h (x) = h (y) + 1 if an arrow points from y to x.
By ﬁxing the height at one particular point, the height at each point of the
dual lattice is deﬁned unambiguously. See [6] for more details. The fact that
1 makes six-vertex
the height diﬀerence between nearest neighbors is always
models ideal models for crystal surfaces of BCC crystals in the (100) direction.
The class of SOS models to which six-vertex models are mapped is also known
as body centered solid on solid models (BCSOS models). In ﬁg. 2.2 an arrow
conﬁguration on a lattice together with the corresponding height function on
the dual lattice is shown.

2.3 Roughening transition in the F model

According to [22] a phase transition of Kosterlitz-Thouless type takes place in
the F model at inverse temperature βǫ = ln (2). If βǫ > ln (2) the crystal surface
as described by the F model is smooth. In this case the height-height correla-
decays exponentially with increasing r.

The logarithmic divergence of the correlation function at large distances is
caused by thermal ﬂuctuations in the local height of the surface with arbitrary
long wavelengths. Note that for ǫ > 0 the F model has a twofold degenerate
ground state consisting of vertex 5 on one sublattice and vertex 6 on the other
sublattice. By introducing a staggered ﬁeld this degeneracy is lifted.
It has
been shown [27] that in a nonzero staggered ﬁeld the F model is in a smooth
phase for positive ǫ.

Chapter 3

Renormalization group
equations for sine-Gordon
type models

In this chapter we will introduce the sine-Gordon type Hamiltonian and then
show how renormalization group equations can be obtained for such models.
First a cut-oﬀ procedure will be introduced to deﬁne the theory. Renormaliza-
tion is carried out by ﬁrst integrating over some of the degrees of freedom of
the model. The model, when formulated in terms of the remaining degrees of
freedom, will look like the original model with a lower cut-oﬀ. Finally a scale
transformation will restore the original cut-oﬀ.

3.1 Eﬀective Hamiltonians for the staggered F-

model

Since the staggered F-model can be interpreted as a solid-on-solid model (see
section 2.2), it is natural to introduce a ﬁeld h, that describes the height of a
surface. The Hamiltonian density of this ﬁeld must possess the same symmetries
as the staggered F-model. In particular we must have:

F (h + 1, βs) = F (h,

βs)

F (h) = F (

−
h)

−

Here s is the staggered ﬁeld, and we have assumed that the ground state of
the staggered F-model (for βǫ > 0 and βs
= 0) corresponds to h = 0 in the
sine-Gordon model. From (3.1) it follows that

F (h + 2, βs) = F (h, βs)

(3.3)

(3.2) and (3.3) lead us to the Hamiltonian density:

F (h, ∂ih, ∂ijh, . . . , βǫ, βs) =

We can think of the constant a as the “lattice constant” of the original micro-
scopic Hamiltonian. In this original model 1
a2 would be the density of degrees
of freedom. The eﬀective Hamiltonian (3.6) should have the same density of de-
grees of freedom. The constant a appears in the Hamiltonian as a consequence
of replacing summations by integrals and ﬁnite diﬀerences by partial derivatives.
We will deﬁne the Fourier transform of the ﬁeld h(x) as

The density of k-values is written as
called a cut-oﬀ function. We shall assume that the cut-oﬀ is chosen such that
P (0) = 1 and all derivatives of P (k) are zero at k = 0. If the volume V is
chosen large enough, a summation over S can be replaced by an integral:

provided that the function F does not correlate with the characteristic function
of S. In case such correlations do exist we have to replace P (k) by the char-
acteristic function of the set S, which we denote as Pc (k). In general we thus
have

The function R (k) which occurs in the deﬁnition of the measure has to be chosen
such that the free energy of the exactly soluble Gaussian model is consistent with
the renormalization group equation for the free energy. Although the correct
choice of R (k) is important for a consistent description of the theory, it turns
out that its eﬀect is equivalent to adding a constant term independent of any
couplings to the Hamiltonian and hence doesn’t inﬂuence the dependence of the
free energy on the couplings.

3.3 Renormalization

The renormalized Hamiltonian is obtained from (3.6) by using the Wilson-Kogut
momentum shell integration technique [29, 37]. We will integrate (3.13) over
some of the degrees of freedom, leaving us with an eﬀective Hamiltonian ( ˜H)
with a lower cut-oﬀ. Next a scale transformation will restore the original cut-oﬀ
and yield the renormalized Hamiltonian (HR).

We must now specify precisely the degrees of freedom we have to integrate
over. Since the renormalized Hamiltonian (HR) has the same cut-oﬀ function
P (k) as the original Hamiltonian (H), and since it is obtained from the eﬀective
Hamiltonian ( ˜H) after a scale transformation, ˜H has to have a cut-oﬀ function
1x. We
of the form P (lk). In terms of l the scale transformation becomes x
thus have to construct a set S(1) of allowed k-values for ˜H, such that S(1)
S
and S(1) corresponds to the cut-oﬀ function P (lk). The complement of S(1) in
S, denoted as S(2), contains the degrees of freedom we have to integrate over.
We thus have to split the set S of k-values into two disjoint sets S(1) and S(2).
This can be done as follows: We decide to put the points k
S
∈
in S(1) with probability P (lk)
S(1). The cut-oﬀ

into a Gaussian interaction for h(1) and h(2), denoted as H (1) respectively H (2)

Note that for a given Hamiltonian the representation (3.20) is not unique be-
cause one may choose to include a Gaussian term in the perturbation X as well.
Such a freedom of choice can sometimes be exploited in ﬁrst order calculations
to improve the accuracy of calculations (see [33]).

(3.18) and (3.19)). To ﬁx the constant K, one has to express HR and H in the

same functional form and then require the constant terms to be equal. From
(3.20), (3.21), (3.23) and (3.24) it follows

3.5 Diagrammatic expansion

It turns out that the terms in the cumulant expansion can be represented as
amplitudes of Feynman-diagrams. In these diagrams the correlation function of
the ﬁeld h(2) plays the role of the propagator. In section B.1 we show that it
takes the form:

where P (2)
is the characteristic function of the set S(2). The amplitudes of
Feynman-diagrams we will encounter later can be expressed as integrals of prod-
ucts of propagators. We have to be carefull with replacing P (2)
by P (2) in such
cases. E.g. we have

We now consider the case of an inﬁnitesimal cut-oﬀ change:

(3.17) becomes

We now associate ǫ with an inﬁnitesimal increase in a rescaling parameter t. The
renormalization process then generates one parameter families of Hamiltonians
H (t). The renormalization group equations can then be written as

Each term in the expansion of the product can be represented diagrammatically

the term γ(r)
from Ty, we draw an oriented
line from xr to xs, we label the line with the value of p, and at the points xr
and xs we put the labels (m) respectively (n) on the line. We repeat this for
all values of p. There is now a one to one correspondence between the set of all
possible terms in the expansion of the product and the set of labelled diagrams.
The amplitude of a labelled diagram is obtained by inserting the appropriate
product of the γ’s and the derivatives of the propagators in (3.48). We see that

Since all labelled diagrams corresponding to a nonvanishing Feynman diagram
make identical contributions, we simply have to multiply the amplitude of one
diagram by the number of ways of labeling a Feynman diagram, to obtain its
amplitude (relabeling the vertices will change the amplitude of a diagram, but
when integrated over all positions of the vertices, all diagrams obtained from
each other by a relabeling of the vertices will, of course, make identical contribu-
tions). This amplitude then has to be integrated over all the xj. We shall denote
the number of ways of orienting the propagators, labeling the propagators and
the vertices by respectively N1, N2 and N3. Since the multi-indices have to be
summed over, two labelings of the propagators will not be considered distinct
if the only diﬀerence is a permutation of the multi-indices. Two labelings of
the vertices are considered distinct if it is not possible to transform one labeling
into the other by a relabeling of the propagators. We then have

gle integral over the volume, thus obtaining a contribution to the Hamiltonian

performed because diﬀerent choices are related by a partial integration). The
problem with this approach is that it assumes that the ﬁeld h(1) is analytic.
In reality one should expect a Taylor-expansion of the ﬁeld to converge only
in a region the size of a (3.12), because a is the distance between independent
degrees of freedom of the ﬁeld.

A better way to proceed is to use the so-called operator product expansion.
Before we explain how this works we will ﬁrst introduce some new terminology.
A local operator is a term in the Hamiltonian that depends only on the ﬁeld in
one point. The Hamiltonian density evaluated at a certain point is an example
of a local operator. The ﬁrst order renormalization group equations for local
operators is almost identical to that of the Hamiltonian density. If O (h (x)) is
a local operator then

(3.66)

λ is called the scale dimension of the operator O. In table 3.1 we have listed a
few eigenoperators with their scale dimensions. By solving (3.66) for all eigen-
operators one obtains a complete set of operators. All eigenoperators can be
written as a multinomial of derivatives of the ﬁeld h multiplied by cos (nπh)
with n an integer. We shall call an operator even (odd) if n is even (odd). We
can now expand any local operator in this set of eigenoperators. A product of
operators localized at diﬀerent points can be considered to be local if the points
lie close to each other. This product can then be expanded in eigenoperators
localized at one point. It is clear that this expansion, known as the operator
product expansion, can be used to replace D
in (3.64) by
a sum of operators localized at the point x1. Suppose all eigenoperators are
enumerated by an index n. The scale dimension of the nth operator will be

Note that we have replaced the ﬁeld h(1) by h. To apply (3.67) to (3.64) a rescal-
ing must thus be performed ﬁrst. It is important to note that (3.67) is an identity
in the sense that the Hamiltonian to which the l.h.s. is added may be identiﬁed
with the Hamiltonian to which the r.h.s. is added. Since D (h (x1)

has to be carried out perturbatively one obtains the operator product expan-
sion coeﬃcients as an expansion in the non-Gaussian couplings. It is thus very
straightforward to ﬁnd the operator product expansion coeﬃcients to zeroth or-
der. Higher order contributions to the operator product expansion coeﬃcients
will again involve nontrivial integrations over Feynman-diagrams. These dia-
grams must again be evaluated using the operator product expansion. E.g. to
ﬁnd the renormalization group equations to second order one has to deal with
expressions as in (3.64) with n = 2. Since the function D is already of second
order one only has to work out the operator product expansion to zeroth order,
which is straightforward. To third order one has to calculate the operator prod-
uct expansion coeﬃcients in (3.68) with n = 3 to zeroth order and the operator
product expansion coeﬃcients with n = 2 to ﬁrst order. The latter ones involve
Feynman-diagrams in which the two operators are connected to one of the other
operators in the Hamiltonian. These diagrams can be evaluated by again using
the operator product expansion (3.68), but now with n = 3 and only to zeroth
order. It is clear that repeated use of the operator product expansion allows
one to obtain the renormalization group equations to any order.

in the next chapter, we are going to apply the theory to ﬁnd the phase

diagram of the staggered F-model.

Once the renormalization group equations are known it is a simple matter to
obtain the singular part of the free energy. In this section we shall ﬁrst derive

We expect that when βs

0, we may replace (3.4) by a Hamiltonian of the
form (4.1). Then because of (3.5) the yn multiplying even (odd) operators will
be even (odd) functions of βs. We now assume that the yn in (4.1) are analytic
in some neighborhood of βs = 0. This implies that the yn corresponding to odd
operators are O (βs). Of all operators, the operator O1 (h) = cos (πh) has the
lowest scale dimension:

Between j = π

inﬁnitesimal y1 increases exponentially under renormalization). Below j = π
8
there are no relevant operators and above j = π
2 the operator cos (2πh) also
becomes relevant. Because the coupling y1 becomes proportional to βs in the
limit βs
0, we expect the staggered F-model with an inﬁnitesimal staggered
ﬁeld to be in a diﬀerent phase than at zero staggered ﬁeld for those values for βǫ
that correspond to a value for j between j = π
2 . According to (4.9)
this is for βǫ in the interval 1

even values of h, we expect to be in a smooth phase. Below βǫ = 1
√2
we still expect that the model will renormalize to (3.4) but as we renormalize

further y1 will renormalize to zero. We are then left with a purely Gaussian
Hamiltonian which describes a rough surface.

Above βǫ = ln (2) the operator cos (2πh) becomes relevant. Since this is an
even operator its coupling is nonzero at zero staggered ﬁeld. This causes the
model to no longer renormalize to the Gaussian model (as a consequence (4.9)
is not valid in this region). If βǫ > ln (2) the surface is thus in a smooth phase
even if βs = 0. To complete the phase diagram we must ﬁnd the behaviour
of the model for ﬁnite values of the staggered ﬁeld below βǫ = 1

gered F-model

We shall assume that the staggered F-model can be mapped to a model of the
form (4.1) such that the couplings yn are analytical as a function of βs in a
neighborhood of βs = 0. If the free energy F of the model (4.1) is written as

F = Fs + Fr

(4.14)

22

with Fs the singular part of the free energy and Fr the regular part of the
free energy, Fs will satisfy the homogeneous part of (4.7) and Fr will be a full
solution of (4.7). Exceptions to this rule may arise when a critical exponent
associated with the singular behaviour of the free energy is an even integer as
we shall see later. Ignoring these exceptions for the moment, we see that Fs
satisﬁes the equation:

Fs (y1 (t) , y2 (t) . . . ) = e2tFs (y1 (0) , y2 (0) . . . )

(4.15)

In order to see how irrelevant operators modify the singular behaviour, it is
enough to keep just one irrelevant coupling. The generalization to more irrele-
vant couplings is trivial. Suppose that for βs
0 the staggered F-model model
is mapped to a model (4.1) with y1 (0) the coupling of the relevant operator
cos (πh) and y2 (0) the coupling of an irrelevant even operator. The mapping to
the model (4.1) can then be written

To complete the phase diagram we must obtain the behaviour of the model at
ﬁnite values for the staggered ﬁeld. This requires us to study the eﬀects of
higher order terms in the renormalization group equations. To ﬁnd the most
important higher order terms we look for terms that are second order in y1.
These terms are involved in the generation of operators. The most important of
these terms is the one involved in the generation of the most relevant operator.
We also look for the lowest order term in the generation of y1 arising from
interactions with operators which have as low an scale dimension as possible.
To second order in y1 only even operators are generated and the most relevant
1
of these is the operator O2 (h) = a2 (
j . It is also this operator which
∇
through interaction with the operator O1 contributes to the generation of O1,
which is also a second order eﬀect. Since O2 is Gaussian we can calculate this
eﬀect simply by perturbing the Gaussian interaction j. Denoting the coupling
of O1 by y and the coupling of O2 by

j′

Although the function A (j) can be calculated using the methods developed
in the previous chapter, for our purpose we can aﬀord to leave this function
undetermined. At j = π

O1 is marginal (i.e. right on the boundary between relevant and irrelevant). To
(cid:1)
investigate the phase diagram around this point, we put j = π

lines with positive K renormalize toward inﬁnity. The ﬂow lines with K = 0
thus mark the boundary between the rough phase and the smooth phase below

We now proceed with a derivation the singular part of the free energy. As the
critical line is approached from the smooth side, we expect singular behaviour
of the free energy (note that points on the critical lines itself renormalize to
the point j′ = 0 on the Gaussian line, there is thus no singularity when the
critical line is approached from the rough side). Since all points on the critical
lines of the staggered F-model ﬂow toward the same point on the Gaussian line,
critical behaviour is the same all along the critical lines. We can thus content
ourselves with a calculation of the singular behaviour of the free energy at βǫ =
1
as we let βs approach zero. In this case we are again in the area
2 ln
where the identiﬁcation (4.37) and the renormalization group equations (4.34)
are valid. The initial values are thus j′ (0) = 0 and y (0) = Rβs. According to
(4.38) we ﬁnd that K = R2 (βs)2 for the streamline that passes through this
point. Eliminating y (t) in favour of j′ (t) and using (4.34) gives us the equation

the line βǫ = 1
2 ln (2). This expansion can be used to generate more information
about the mapping of the staggered F-model to Gaussian models.

Chapter 5

Expansions about free
fermion models

In this ﬁnal chapter we will ﬁrst present Baxters solution of the staggered F-
model on the free fermion line (i.e. the line βǫ = 1
2 ln (2)). Then we proceed
by expanding the free energy of the staggered F-model about the free fermion
line. We shall obtain an explicit expression for the free energy to ﬁrst order.
By comparing the singular behaviour of this expression to that obtained from
renormalization group arguments, we are able to verify the known behaviour
of the Gaussian coupling to ﬁrst order about βǫ = 1
2 ln (2). To simplify the
computations of the higher order terms we derive a linked cluster method.

5.1 Deﬁnition of free fermion models

Baxter has solved the staggered F-model at the temperature βǫ = 1
2 ln(2) [3].
Later it was found that this solution could be generalized to other models if
a certain condition concerning the vertex weights is met. This condition is
called the free fermion condition because for eight-vertex models satisfying this
condition the problem leads to a problem of noninteracting fermions in the S-
matrix formulation. Let wi be the vertex weight for a vertex of type i (see ﬁg.
5.1), then the free fermion condition for six-vertex models is:

w1w2 + w3w4 −

w5w6 = 0

(5.1)

The weights wi may be chosen inhomogeneous. We now proceed by presenting
a simpliﬁed version of Baxter’s solution of the staggered F-model.

5.2 Baxter’s solution of the staggered F-model

Divide the lattice into two sublattices A and B. Choose the vertex energies
as indicated in ﬁg. 5.1. Consider the ground state in which all A vertices are
vertices of type 6, and all B-vertices are of type 5. Any state can now be
represented by drawing lines on the lattice where the arrows point oppositely
to the ground state conﬁguration. In terms of these lines the six vertices are
represented by vertices with either no lines, two lines at right angles, or four

step is to replace the original lattice by a decorated lattice by replacing each
original vertex by a “city” of four internally connected points (see ﬁg. 5.2). The
lines on the original lattice are regarded as dimers on the external bonds of the
decorated lattice. For any conﬁguration on the original lattice, it is possible to
place dimers on the internal bonds of the decorated lattice, so that the lattice
becomes completely covered. Now associate to each dimer a weight as indicated
in ﬁg. 5.2. We now have to choose these weights such that a close-packed
dimer problem formulated on the decorated lattice is equivalent to our original
problem. It is a simple matter to see that for this to be the case, we have to
have:

Note that (5.4) is indeed consistent with the free fermion condition (5.1).

5.3 The Pfaﬃan method

To solve the close-packed dimer problem, we use the Pfaﬃan method [10,13,26].
This method is applicable whenever the lattice is planar, and works by express-
ing the partition function of the problem as the square root of the determinant
of an antisymmetric matrix (a Pfaﬃan).

A contribution to Z 2 can be written as the product of two dimer coverings

C and C′. If C connects a point i with a point j, we write

C (i) = j

(5.5)

It is clear that this deﬁnes a bijective map on the lattice. C and C′ divide the
lattice into disjoint loops and pairs of neighboring points (bonds) as follows: If

then the points i1 . . . in form a loop. If n = 2, we don’t get a loop but instead
a single bond. Note that n is always even (even on lattice types on which loops
containing an odd number of points exist, the loops generated by C and C′
always contain an even number of points). Since for each loop one has two
choices to deﬁne the actions of C and C′ within the loop, a given partition of
the lattice in loops and bonds is consistent with many diﬀerent conﬁgurations
C and C′. Z 2 can thus be calculated by summing over all partitions of the
lattice in loops and bonds. The contribution a partition makes is given by the
appropriate product of the weights of dimers, multiplied by a factor 2L, where L
is the number of loops in the partition. If we orient each loop, and sum over all
oriented loops, the factor two for each loop can be ommitted. Now a partition
of the lattice in oriented loops and bonds deﬁnes a permutation of the lattice
points. For arbitrary points i and j on the lattice, we deﬁne Wi,j as

if i and j are not connected,

Wi,j = 0

Wi,j = weight of the dimer connecting i and j

(5.8)

In terms of the matrix W , we can write:

Z 2 =

′

Wj,π(j)

π
X

j
Y

where the sum is over all permutations that contain only cycles of even lengths
(this restriction is denoted by the prime) and the product is over all lattice
points. Note that the restriction on the summation is only necessary for lattices
where loops of odd lengths exist. We now want to rewrite the r.h.s. of (5.9) as
the determinant of a matrix. This is possible if the lattice is planar, and works
as follows: One tries to factorize the missing sign of the permutation π (s (π))
in the sum in (5.9), so that we have

with the si,j depending only on i and j, and si,j =
1 (we only need to deﬁne
the si,j when i and j are connected). We shall see that a proper choice of the
si,j allows one to lift the constraint in the summation in ( 5.9). Anticipating
this result we can write:

±

where

The si,j have to be chosen such that (5.10) is valid for all permutations making
a nonzero contribution to (5.9). The cycles of such a permutation are precisely
the oriented loops of even length and bonds, and they all have a sign of
1. We
thus try to deﬁne the si,j such that for a closed loop of even length or a bond
consisting of the points i1 . . . in we have

(5.14)

so that R is antisymmetric. We can now see that permutations containing cycles
of odd lengths make no net contribution to det R because reversing such a cycle
changes the sign of the contribution. A permutation that contains a cycle with
an odd number of points in its interior also makes no net contribution, because,
the lattice being planar, these points are permuted amongst themselves, so
that the permutation contains at least one cycle of odd length. We thus have
to satisfy (5.13) only for loops with an even number of points in its interior.
This is fortunate, because it is impossible to choose the si,j such that (5.13) is
satisﬁed for all loops of even lengths. The si,j can, however, be chosen to satisfy
the condition:

(5.15)

where r is the number of points inside the loop. It is clear that if the si,j satisfy
(5.15) for all loops we indeed have Z 2 = det R. We now specialize to the case of
the staggered F-model. In this case we are dealing with the lattice shown in ﬁg.
5.2. Choosing the si,j amounts to giving each bond an orientation so that si,j is
positive if i points to j. The arrows drawn on the bonds in ﬁg. 5.2 represent such
an orientation. We will now proof that this choice of the orientations satisﬁes
the condition (5.15). The proof proceeds by induction, and depends on the
fact that loops sharing part of their boundaries may be combined to produce
larger loops. Note that a loop can be broken down into smaller loops if and
only if the loop has bonds in its interior. On the lattice (5.2), there are two
types of loops that cannot be broken down. These are the loops formed by four
internal bonds of a city, and loops connecting four cities formed by four external
bonds and four internal bonds. For these loops it is easily veriﬁed that (5.15)
is true. Since any loop can be broken down into loops of the above type, we
have to proof that if (5.15) holds for two arbitrary loops sharing part of their
boundaries, it also holds for the combined loop. To see this, suppose that there
are two loops (L1 and L2) with respectively r1 and r2 interior points, with a
continuous common boundary consisting of q points. The combined loop (L3)
will then have r3 = r1 + r2 + q
2 interior points. The product in (5.15) for a
loop Li will be denoted as s (Li). We then have

−

s (L1) s (L2) = s (L3) (

1)q

−

−

(5.16)

because if we travers L1 and L2 in the same direction, we travers all the bonds

The meaning of the orientations on the bonds is explained in the text.

about βǫ = 1
2 ln (2), we also need the inverse of R. Both the determinant and
the inverse of R are easily calculated using the following procedure: At each
vertex i on the decorated lattice, we associate a variables xi and x′i. For x′i a
given set of variables, we attempt to solve the equation:

Ri,jxj = x′i

(5.18)

We can rewrite this as follows: Introduce coordinates (n, m) on the original
lattice, so that increasing n (m) corresponds to moving to the right (upward). To
each city on the decorated lattice, we assign the coordinates of the corresponding
vertex of the original lattice. The variables xi and x′i are now given by placing
variables an,m, bn,m, cn,m, dn,m and a′n,m, b′n,m, c′n,m, d′n,m for every n and m
on the four points of the city with coordinates (n, m) as indicated in ﬁg. 5.3.

5.5 Singular part of the free energy

5.6 Perturbation theory

We now proceed with the derivation of a perturbation theory about the free
fermion line of a 6-vertex model. The Hamiltonian of a general 6-vertex model
can be deﬁned as follows. One assigns an energy e (p, i) to a vertex in state p
(see ﬁg. 5.1) and position i. The conﬁguration of the lattice can be speciﬁed
by a function c which maps a position of a vertex to a number, 1
6, which
is to be interpreted as the state of the vertex at that position. The reduced
Hamiltonian (H) is deﬁned to be the functional that assigns to each state c its
energy times

β. We can thus write

· · ·

−

H (c) =

β

−

e (c (i) , i)

For H a Hamiltonian of a general 6-vertex model and H0 a Hamiltonian of

a free fermion model a perturbation V can be deﬁned so that we have

The partition function Z can be written as:

H = H0 + V

Z =

eH0(c)+V (c) = Z0

(cid:10)

(cid:11)

Here Z0 is the partition function of the free fermion model. The reduced free

(5.42)

, we can proceed as follows:
To compute a free fermion average
Introduce a constraint in the free fermion model by requiring the vertices at the
positions i1 . . . in to be in the states x1 . . . xn. The partition function of this
model is denoted by Zi1···

in (x1 . . . xn). We can then write

Zi1···

in (x1 . . . xn) V (x1) . . . V (xn)

Z0

(5.43)

x1...xn
X
in (x1 . . . xn). It is convenient to reformulate
It now remains to calculate Zi1···
this problem as follows: Denote the state of an arrow located at the bond j by
sj. Put sj = 1 if the arrow points oppositely to the ground state conﬁguration
and sj = 0 otherwise. Deﬁne a constrained free fermion model by requiring the
m. We then want to evaluate
arrow at the bond jr to be in state sjr for 1
the partition function of this model, which we denote as Z (sj1 . . . sjm ). The
idea is to perturb the weights of the dimers on the bonds jr inﬁnitesimally. We
assign a weight C (1 + ǫr) to the dimer on the bond jr. The partition function

≤

≤

r

35

of the (unconstrained) free fermion model (Z (ǫ1 . . . ǫm)) can be written in terms
of the constrained partition functions as:

Z (ǫ1 . . . ǫm) =

(5.44)

Z (ǫ1 . . . ǫm) can be calculated using (5.11), by making the necessary changes to
R. We can write:

R = R0 +

ǫkR(k)

(5.45)

Here R0 is the original unperturbed matrix, R(k) is deﬁned as follows:

R(k),ij = C
if i and j are connected by jk and i points to j,

R(k),ij =

C

−

if i and j are connected by jk and j points to i,
R(k),ij = 0
if i and j are not connected by jk.

Note that the R(k) have only two nonzero matrix elements. Inserting (5.45) in
(5.11) and expanding gives:

Using (5.46) and (5.44) we can directly read oﬀ the constrained partition func-
tions which have all their arguments set to +1 (i.e. all the constrained arrows
point oppositely to the ground state conﬁguration). To calculate a constrained
partition function with some of its arguments set to 0, we simply have to apply
the principle of inclusion and exclusion (i.e. a M¨obius inversion on the power
set of arguments). For example consider the evaluation of Z (s1, s2, s3, s4, s5),
with s1 = s2 = 1 and s3 = s4 = s5 = 0. Put t3 = t4 = t5 = 1. According to the
principle of incusion and exclusion, we can write:

(cid:1)(cid:3)

i

Z (s1, s2, s3, s4, s5) = Z (s1, s2)

[Z (s1, s2, t3) + Z (s1, s2, t4) + Z (s1, s2, t5)]

+Z (s1, s2, t3, t4) + Z (s1, s2, t3, t5) + Z (s1, s2, t4, t5)

Z (s1, s2, t3, t4, t5)

5.7 First order computation for the staggered

F-model

For the staggered F-model the expansion can be simpliﬁed. The vertex in the
ground state at a particular point will be referred to as an a-vertex. A b-vertex

36

is obtained by reversing the arrows of an a-vertex. An a-vertex (b-vertex) is
s (s). The constrained partition
thus of type 5 or 6 and has an energy of
function corresponding to the model with one vertex constrained to be an a-
vertex (b-vertex) is denoted as Za (Zb). Note that under the transformation
s

s the rˆole of vertices a and b are interchanged. We thus have

Za (βs) = Zb (

point oppositely to an a-vertex. If we choose to constrain two horizontal arrows,
for i and j corresponding to an a or b variable on the decorated
we need the R−

5.9 Linked cluster expansion

In this section we will derive a diagrammatic (linked cluster) method to compute
terms in the perturbative expansion of the free energy. Instead of perturbing
the energies of vertices 1...4, we will perturb the energy of an a-vertex. We
will consider the model with the following vertex energies: vertices 1...4 are
assigned an energy of ǫ0, with βǫ0 = 1
2 ln (2), a-vertices are assigned an energy
s0 + v, and b-vertices are assigned an energy of s0. The reduced free energy
of
of this model is denoted as ˜F (
βv). It is not diﬃcult to see that the reduced

free energy of the staggered F-model can be obtained from ˜F :

Vi (c) = 0 otherwise. If we put all the Ji = 1, H (

of these two bonds will be denoted as, respectively, ip1 and ip2. To compute
Zi1···
ik , we deﬁne an inhomogeneous free fermion model by changing the weights
of the modiﬁed bonds. At all positions j we associate the variables ǫj1 and ǫj2
to, respectively, the modiﬁed bonds at j1 and j2. We now choose the weight of
a dimer on a modiﬁed bond at a position k to be a function of ǫk, so that we

function of the ǫ’s, so (5.83) is certainly not true when not all of the indices are
diﬀerent. Although this doesn’t seem to be a big problem, because there is no
point in constraining a certain vertex more than once, we have to sum over all
indices to calculate Z (J = 1) and it is convenient to do so unrestrictively. The
solution to this problem is obvious. We deﬁne w (ǫk) as

ik , and this equals according to (5.82) the r.h.s. of (5.83).

as a summation of amplitudes of all closed paths of n steps, where a single
step consists of going from a position ir to an arbitrary position jr+1, and

in+1 = i1 and jn+1 = j1. Hence it follows that we are dealing with closed paths.
To each step we associate a weight which in the example given above equals
Gir ,jr+1Bjr+1,ir+1 . The amplitude of a path is the product of the weights of
the steps forming the path. Each closed path can be deﬁned as an oriented
loop of which one point plays the rˆole of starting and end point.
It is clear
that the amplitude of the path does not depend on the choice of the starting
point. It also does not depend on the orientation, because both G and B are
antisymmetric. Instead of summing over closed paths, we may thus sum over
loops. To do this, we need to know the number of closed paths that correspond
to one loop. It is clear that this is given by two times the number of ways one

can attach a starting point to the loop.
if the winding number of the loop is p (i.e. traversing the loop once, means
visiting the same points in the same order p times) then there are n

attaching an starting point to the loop. Suppose all loops are enumerated in
some arbitrary order. We deﬁne the amplitude of the rth loop, denoted as Lr,

Similarly, contributions from loops with winding numbers greater than one can-

shall see later, such cancellations will also occur in the expansion of Z (J = 1),
ln (Z (J = 1)) will contain only connected diagrams (the precise deﬁnition of
“connected” will be given later ). Diagrams in which a bond appears more than
once can make a net contribution to ln (Z (J = 1)) because the disconnected
diagrams against which such a contribution would cancel don’t appear in the
expansion of ln (Z (J = 1)). To take into account the cancellation of loops with

is a multinomial in the ǫ’s. To have that each diagram is a monomial, we split
each modiﬁed bond on the decorated lattice into an inﬁnite number of bonds,
each of them connecting the same two points as the original bond. These bonds
are all assigned the same orientation as the original bond. The weights of these
bonds are chosen by assigning to each bond a (diﬀerent) term in the expansion
of (5.84) in powers of ǫ. It now follows that (5.92) still holds on this new lattice.
We can see this as follows. Let all loops on the new lattice be enumerated. The
amplitude of the kth loop will be denoted as ˜Lk. Since the sum of the weights
of the new bonds replacing one modiﬁed bond equals the weight of the modiﬁed
bond, we can write

Note that the cancellation of diagrams discussed above implies that a diagram

make no net contribution. In particular loops with winding numbers greater
than one will cancel against products of loops with smaller winding numbers.
To emphasize this we can rewrite (5.93) as follows. We say that a loop on the
new lattice corresponds to a loop on the modiﬁed lattice if the same points can
be traversed in the same order. The amplitude of a loop on the new lattice
corresponding to a loop r on the modiﬁed lattice (both with a winding number
of one) shall be written as ˜Lr,k, where the index k enumerates all such loops.

These two bonds will be referred to as bonds of order k. A bond that connects
the points ai and ci will be referred to as a bond of type 1, a bond that connects

be called balanced if at every city the sum of the orders of bonds of type 1 in
the diagram equals the sum of the orders of bonds of type 2. From (5.83) it
follows that only balanced diagrams contribute to Zi1···

space of functions S is deﬁned, a space of continuous linear functionals S′ on S
can be deﬁned. We shall deﬁne the set S as the set of all functions h(x) that
can be written as in (3.8). Apart from the usual L2-norm we deﬁne a Fr´echet

Appendix C

Calculation of *eıT h

In this appendix we derive equation (3.45). First we derive this equation in the
special case of a distribution T that can be written as a ﬁnite linear combination
of Dirac delta’s. By taking appropriate limits of this special case we arrive at
(3.45).

Let the distribution T be deﬁned by:

T h =

αnh (xn)

n

(C.1)

In this case we have

This proves (3.45) in this special case. Proving the general case is a matter of
taking limits in (C.12). First we take the continuum limit in (C.12). Let T
be a distribution generated by a bounded continuous function T (x) i.e. T h =
d2xT (x)h(x). Then since there exist distributions Tn of the form (C.1), such

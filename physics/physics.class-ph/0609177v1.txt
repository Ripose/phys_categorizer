We present a clear and mathematically simple procedure explaining spontaneous symmetry break-
ing in quantum mechanical systems. The procedure is applicable to a wide range of models and
can be easily used to explain the existence of a symmetry broken state in crystals, antiferromagnets
and even superconductors. It has the advantage that it automatically brings to the fore the main
players in spontaneous symmetry breaking: the symmetry breaking ﬁeld, the thermodynamic limit,
and the global excitations of the thin spectrum.

I.

INTRODUCTION

In quantum mechanics symmetry has a much more
powerful role than in classical mechanics. Translational
invariance in a classical setup causes momentum to be
conserved; in quantum mechanics it immediately implies
that all eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are spread out
with equal amplitude over all of space. Using this line of
reasoning, it could be argued that since a chair is built
up out of many microscopic particles, which all obey the
rules of quantum mechanics, the chair as a whole should
in fact also respect the symmetry of its Hamiltonian and
be spread out across all of space. Clearly this is not the
physically realized situation. The way out of the paradox
is the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the collective
system. The description of spontaneous symmetry break-
ing in macroscopic objects which are constructed from
microscopic, quantum mechanical constituents, is one of
the highlights of modern condensed matter theory.1,2,3,4,5
It is used to explain the classicality of macroscopic sys-
tems ranging from crystals and antiferromagnets all the
way to superconductors.11

The general idea behind spontaneous symmetry break-
ing is easily formulated: as a collection of quantum me-
chanical particles grows larger, the object as a whole be-
comes ever more unstable against small perturbations. In
the end even an inﬁnitesimal perturbation is enough to
cause the collective system to break the underlying sym-
metry of the Hamiltonian. The fact that the symmetry
breaking can happen spontaneously is then signaled by
a set of non-commuting limits: In the complete absence
of perturbations even a macroscopic system should con-
form to the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. If on the other
hand the system is allowed to grow to macroscopic size
in the presence of even just an inﬁnitesimal perturbation,
then it will be able to break the symmetry and end up
in a classical state. This clear intuitive picture of spon-
taneous symmetry breaking is unfortunately not always
easy to demonstrate in an equally clear mathematical de-
scription of the process. In this paper we present a sim-
ple mathematical procedure that can be applied to the
spontaneous breaking of any continuous symmetry and
that naturally emphasized the roles of the key players in
this process. The procedure is described by considering

the example of a quantum harmonic crystal which spon-
taneously breaks translational symmetry. However, all
of the methods, i.e. bosonization, using the Bogoliubov
transformation to identify the thin spectrum of states in-
volved in spontaneous symmetry breaking, introducing a
symmetry breaking ﬁeld in the collective dynamics and
ﬁnally considering a non-commuting order of limits, can
be easily transferred to other cases as well.6,7,8

II. THE HARMONIC CRYSTAL

As the most basic example of spontaneous symmetry
breaking, we consider how translational symmetry is bro-
ken in a crystalline lattice.7 Consider the textbook exam-
ple of a harmonic crystal, with the Hamiltonian

H =

p2
j

+

κ

xj+1)2 ,

(xj −

(1)

j

j

where j labels all N atoms in the lattice, which have
mass m, momentum pj and position xj. We consider
here only a one-dimensional chain of atoms, but all of the
following can be straightforwardly generalized to higher
dimensions as well. κ parameterizes a harmonic potential
between neighboring atoms; the results on spontaneous
symmetry breaking that follow however, are equally valid
for an-harmonic potentials.7

In the standard treatment of the harmonic oscillator
one uses a Fourier transformation of the Hamiltonian to
be able to identify its eigenstates. We follow a slightly
longer route by introducing boson (phonon) operators
from the outset, and diagonalizing them using a so called
Bogoliubov transformation.9 This has the advantage that
it naturally brings to the fore the thin spectrum of the
quantum crystal, and that it enables us to keep track of
the center of mass motion of the crystal as a whole.10
The momentum and position operators can be expressed
in terms of bosonic operators as

so that the commutation relation [xj , pj′ ] = i~δj,j′ is ful-

The ﬁnal form of the Hamiltonian in terms of phonon
operators of course coincides with the standard text book
result, but the use of the Bogoliubov transformation to
get here has the advantage that it draws attention to a
rather subtle point. When k

0 and the two parameters in the Bogoliubov trans-

formation diverge (sinh(uk)
).
Precisely at k = 0 the canonical transformation is thus
no longer well deﬁned. This means that we should really
treat the k = 0 part of the Hamiltonian (1) separately
from the rest.10 The excitations with k = 0 are the ones
that describe the collective dynamics of the quantum
crystal as a whole, and therefore they are also precisely
the states that are involved in the collective symmetry
breaking. The k = 0 part of the Hamiltonian, written
again in terms of the original operators, is given by

j pj = √N pk=0 is the total momentum

P

Hamiltonian, which describes the external dynamics of
the crystal as a whole, in fact commutes with the rest of
the Hamiltonian, which describes the internal dynamics
of the phonon modes inside the crystal. We therefore
focus on this collective part of the Hamiltonian from now
on, and disregard the phonon spectrum given by (4).

The eigenstates of the collective Hamiltonian Hcoll are
very low in energy: their excitation energies scale with
1/N , where N is the number of atoms in the crystal. In
the thermodynamic limit all of these states thus become
nearly degenerate. It is because of this property that in
the thermodynamic limit a combination of these states
which breaks the symmetry of the Hamiltonian can be
spontaneously formed. On the other hand these collec-
tive eigenstates are so few in number and of such low
energy that their contribution to the free energy com-
pletely disappears in the thermodynamic limit. This can
be easily understood by looking at their contribution to
the partition function

The free energy of the total system is an extensive quan-
ln(N )/N disappears in the limit
tity, so that Fthin/Ftot ∝

. The states of this part of the spectrum are
thus invisible in thermodynamically measurable quanti-
ties such as for instance the speciﬁc heat of macroscopic
crystals, and it is consequently called the thin spectrum
of the quantum crystal.

To see how the states in the thin spectrum can conspire
to break the translational symmetry, we need to add a
small symmetry breaking ﬁeld to the Hamiltonian:

(7)

Here the symmetry breaking ﬁeld B is introduced as a
mathematical tool, and need not really exist. In fact, we
will send the value of B to zero at the end of the calcu-
lation. The Hamiltonian (7) is the standard form of the
Hamiltonian for a quantum harmonic oscillator, and its
eigenstates are well known. The groundstate wavefunc-
tion can be written as

with ω =

the total momentum states that make up the thin spec-
trum. Apart from the groundstate conﬁguration there
are also collective eigenstates that are described by the
excitations of the harmonic oscillator equation (7). These
excitations describe the collective motion of the crys-
tal as a whole. As N grows larger the groundstate
wavepacket becomes more and more localized at the posi-
tion xtot = 0, until it is completely localized as N
.

That this localization can in fact occur spontaneously,

without the existence of a physical symmetry breaking
ﬁeld B can be seen by considering the non commuting
limits

ψ0(xtot) = const

ψ0(xtot) = δxtot,0.

(9)

If we do not include any symmetry breaking ﬁeld at all
then the crystal is always completely delocalized, and re-
spects the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. If on the other
hand we do allow for a symmetry breaking ﬁeld, then
it turns out that in the limit of having inﬁnitely many
constituent particles, an inﬁnitesimally small symmetry
breaking ﬁeld is enough to completely localize the crystal
in a single position. This mathematical instability clearly
implies that in the thermodynamic limit the symmetry
breaking in fact happens spontaneously.

To see in a more rigorous manner whether or not the
crystal as a whole is localized, we should look at the spa-

tial ﬂuctuations of the crystal:
the size of these ﬂuctuations is meaningless. The ﬂuctua-
tions become meaningful only if they are compared to the
size of the crystal itself. Because the size of the crystal
is directly proportional to the number of particles in the
system, the correct orderparameter to look at in this case

where in the last line we again consider only the k = 0
part of the Hamiltonian, and we have expanded the co-
sine to quadratic order. The fact that the symmetry
breaking ﬁeld now scales as 1/N is a direct consequence
of our deﬁnition of the microscopic symmetry breaking
ﬁeld. In fact the factor 1/N cannot be avoided if we in-
sist that the microscopic Hamiltonian be extensive. This
may seem to imply an end to the localization of the total
wavefunction ψ0 (xtot), but in fact spontaneous symme-
try breaking is still possible as long as we consider the
correct orderparameter. Even though the wavefunction
itself does not reduce to a delta function anymore, the
spatial ﬂuctuations of the crystal as compared to its size
do still become negligible in the thermodynamic limit if
an inﬁnitesimal symmetry breaking ﬁeld is included:

Once again the disappearance of ﬂuctuations in the ther-
modynamic limit signals the spontaneous localization of
the crystal as a whole.

For a clear view on the essential ingredients of spon-
taneous symmetry breaking, this digression into exten-
sivity and a correct choice for the symmetry breaking
ﬁeld seems unnecessary and therefore we have chosen to
ignore these subtleties in our main treatment of quan-
tum mechanical spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the
application of this procedure to other systems, such as
antiferromagnets and superconductors, these issues don’t
come up because one is forced to consider extensive mod-
els from the outset. On the other hand, in those cases the
mathematics of diagonalizing the collective Hamiltonian
is a bit more involved.7,8

IV. SUBTLETIES

V. DISCUSSION

In the derivation of the spontaneous symmetry break-
ing of a harmonic crystal we have been somewhat sloppy
in the deﬁnition of the symmetry breaking ﬁeld. After all,
the collective model of equation (5) was only the k = 0
part of the full blown Hamiltonian (1), but we did not
consider the symmetry breaking ﬁeld to be only the k = 0
part of some other ﬁeld acting on all atoms individually.
It would therefore be better to start with a microscopic
model which already includes a symmetry breaking ﬁeld,
like for example

We have presented in this paper a simple way of math-
ematically underpinning the explanation of the eﬀect of
spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum mechanical
systems. The procedure starts out with the bosonization
of the microscopic Hamiltonian. The quadratic part of
the bosonized Hamiltonian can in principle be diagonal-
ized using a Bogoliubov transformation, but in doing so
one ﬁnds that there are some modes for which the trans-
formation is ill-deﬁned. It can be shown that these singu-
lar modes are precisely the ones describing the dynamics
of the system as a whole (as opposed to the dynamics
of constituent particles within the system). These col-
lective excitations should be treated separately from all
other modes, and together they deﬁne the collective part
of the Hamiltonian of the system. The eigenstates of this
collective Hamiltonian which scale as 1/N form the so
called thin spectrum, and it is a combination of these
states that will make up the symmetry broken wavefunc-
tion in the end. As a mathematical tool necessary to be

able to see the symmetry breaking explicitly, we intro-
duce the symmetry breaking ﬁeld B. If we then look at
the new groundstate wavefunction, or at a suitably de-
ﬁned order parameter for the system, then we see that
in the thermodynamic limit even an inﬁnitesimally small
ﬁeld B is enough to completely break the symmetry of

ductors and should in principle be applicable to all quan-
tum mechanical systems which spontaneously break some

11 Notice that ferromagnetism is explicitly not included in
this list. The ferromagnet has a large number of possible
exact groundstates which are all precisely degenerate, and
which all have a ﬁnite magnetization. The singling out of
one of these eigenstates is in a sense more like classical sym-
metry breaking than like the quantum symmetry breaking
discussed here. The quantum symmetry breaking causes a
state which is not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian to be
realized, and thus goes much further than only singling out
one particular eigenstate.

Abstract

It is demonstrated how all the mechanical equations of classical electrodynamics
(CEM) may be derived from only Coulomb’s inverse square force law, special rel-
ativity and Hamilton’s Principle. The instantaneous nature of the Coulomb force
in the centre-of-mass frame of two interacting charged objects, mediated by the
exchange of space-like virtual photons, is predicted by QED. The interaction La-
grangian of QED is shown to be identical, in the appropriate limit, to the potential
energy term in the Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian of CEM. A comparison is made
with the Feynman-Wheeler action-at-a-distance formulation of CEM.

Introduction

At the beginning of Book III of the Principia [1] Newton introduced four ‘Rules of

Reasoning in Philosophy’. The ﬁrst of them was:

We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both

true and sufficient to explain their appearences.

It is still a salutary exercise to apply this simple principle to any domain of science.
What are fundamental and truly important in the scientiﬁc description of phenomena
are those concepts that cannot be discarded without destroying the predictive power of
the theory. The most powerful, the best, scientiﬁc theory is that which describes the
widest possible range of natural phenomena in terms of the minimum number of essential
(i.e. non-discardable) concepts. It is the aim of the present paper to apply this precept
of Newton to Classical Electromagnetism (CEM). The relation of CEM to Quantum
Electrodynamics (QED), in the attempt to obtain a deeper physical understanding of the
former, will also be discussed.

From the work of Coulomb, Amp`ere and Faraday on, the basic phenomena of CEM,
i.e. what are actually observed in experiments, are the forces between electric charges
at rest or in motion, or the dynamical consequences of such forces. The force between
two static charges is given by Coulomb’s inverse square law. This law will taken as a
postulate in the following, but no other dynamical concept or theoretical construction
will be introduced as an independent hypothesis in order to build up the theory. Later,
it will be seen that, in QED, this law is a necessary consequence of the existence of, and
exchange of, space-like virtual photons between the electric charges.

It will be assumed throughout that the system of interacting electric charges is a
conservative one, in Classical Mechanics, and so may be described by a Lagrangian that is
a function of the coordinates and velocities of the charges, but does not depend explicitly
on the time. Calculating the Action from the Lagrangian of the system and applying
Hamilton’s Principle that the Action be an extremum with respect to variation of the
space-time trajectories of the charges, yields, in the well-known manner, the Lagrange
equations that provide a complete dynamical description of the system [2].

It is further required that the physical description be consistent with Special Relativity.
For this, the Lagrangian must be a Lorentz scalar. To introduce the method to be used to
construct the Lagrangian, which is likely to be familiar only to particle physicists, I quote
a passage taken from some lecture notes by R.Hagedorn [3] on relativistic kinematics
dating from some four decades ago:

If a question is of such a nature that its answer will be always the
same, no matter in which Lorentz system one starts, then it is possible to
formulate the answer entirely with the help of those invariants which one
can build with the available four vectors.

general answer...
of calculation until one has completely understood that there is really no
jugglery or guesswork in it and that it is absolutely safe.

It is important to stress the last sentence in this passage in relation to the word ‘true’
in Newton’s philosophical precept quoted above. Just the method outlined above was used
to derive the BMT equation for spin motion in arbitary magnetic and electric ﬁelds [4].

It will be demonstrated in the following that it is suﬃcient to apply Hagedorn’s pro-
gramme to the simplest possible non-trivial electrodynamical system that may be con-
sidered: two mutually interacting electric charges, in order to derive all the mechanical
equations of CEM, as well as Maxwell’s equations, with Coulomb’s inverse square law as
the only dynamical hypothesis.

An aspect that is not touched upon in the treatement is radiation.

In this case a
fundamental classical description of the phenomenon, in the sense of Newton’s precept,
is not possible and Quantum Mechanics must be invoked. In the language of QED, the
existence of real photons as well as the virtual photons responsible for the Coulomb force,
must be admitted. Indeed, extra degrees of freedom must be added to the Lagrangian to
describe the propagation of real photons and their interaction with electric charges. A
brief comment is made in the concluding section on the relation of Maxwell’s equations
to radiation phenomena; however, no detailed comparison with QED is attempted.

It is also assumed throughout the paper that the eﬀects of gravitation, that is of
the curvature of space-time, on the interaction between the charged physical objects
considered, may be neglected.

2 Lorentz Invariant Lagrangian for Two Mutually In-

teracting Electrically Charged Objects

Two physical objects O1 and O2 of masses m1 and m2 and electric charges q1 and q2,
respectively, are assumed to be in spatial proximity, far from all other electric charges,
so that they interact electromagnetically, but are subjected to no external forces. The
spatial positions of O1 and O2 are speciﬁed, relative to their common center-of-energy, by
the vectors ~r1 and ~r2 respectively. The spatial distance separating the two objects in their
common center-of-mass (CM) frame: r12 = r21 is given by the modulus of the vectors ~r12,
~r21 where:

~r12 =

~r21 = ~r1 −
−

~r2

(2.1)

In the frame where the object O2 is at rest, and provided that the object O1 has
a velocity much smaller than that of light, c, the force exerted on O1 by the charge of
O2 is given by Coulomb’s inverse square law and the non-relativistic Lagrangian, LN R

describing the motion of the object O1 is1:

V1 =

(2.2)

~r12|
|

T1, V1 and v1 are the kinetic energy, potential energy and the velocity respectively of
O1, and r12 =
. A covariant Lagrangian describing the system O1, O2 will now
be constructed in such a way that it reduces to Eqn(2.2) and to the similar expression
describing non relativistic (NR) motion of O2 when O1 is at rest, in the appropriate limits.
The Lagrangian must be a Lorentz scalar constructed from the 4-vectors2: x1 −
x2, u1
and u2 that completely specify the spatial and kinematical conﬁguration of the interacting
system. Here ~x1 = ~r1, ~x2 = ~r2 and the ‘4-vector velocity’, u, is deﬁned as:

dx
dτ

u

≡

d
dt

= γ

(ct; ~x) = (γc; γ~v)

(2.3)

where τ is the proper time of the object. In general, the Lagrangian may depend on the
following six Lorentz invariants, constructed from the relevant 4-vectors:

(x1 −

u1 ·

(x1 −

that is the Lagrangian may be written as:

L(x1, u1; x2, u2) = α0+α1(x1−
(2.4)
where the coeﬃcients α0-α6 are Lorentz-scalars that may also be, in general, arbitary
functions of the six Lorentz invariants listed above. Choosing the NR limit with O2 at
rest:

(c; ~v1),

u2 →

(c;~0)

gives:

α1r2

L(x1, u1; x2, u2) = α0 −

α2~v1 ·
where a time-like metric is chosen for 4-vector products. Note that ~x1 and ~x2 are deﬁned
at the same time, t, in the CM frame of O1 and O2, so that t1 = t2 = t in the 4-vectors x1
and x2. Thus the Coulomb interaction is assumed to be instantaneous in the CM frame.
As discussed in Section 6 below, such behaviour is a prediction of QED. Consistency
between Eqns(2.2) and (2.5) requires that3:

To now introduce the concepts of distinct ‘electric’ and ‘magnetic’ ﬁelds it is suﬃcient to
consider only the motion of O1. To simplify the equations the labels ‘1’ and ‘2’ will be
dropped in Eqn(3.2) and the following notation is used for spatial partial derivatives:

∂
∂xi ≡ ∇i
The Lagrangian (3.2) is now introduced into the Lagrange equation (2.11). Considering
the 1 spatial components of the 4-vectors, the ﬁrst term on the LHS of Eqn(2.11) is:

The concepts of ‘electric’ and ‘magnetic’ ﬁelds have therefore appeared naturally as a
means to simplify the Lorentz force equation (3.10). However, the RHS of this equation
is completely deﬁned, via Eqn(3.1), by the 4-vector current j2, the spatial separation r12
of O1 and O2 and the 3-velocity of O1, so that the 4-vector potential A may be eliminated
from the Lorentz force equation. Substituting the deﬁnition of A from Eqn(3.1) into
Eqns(3.11) and (3.12), and restoring the labels of quantities associated with O2, gives4:

invariant quantities, similar to r12 in Eqn(2.9). See also [7] for a general discussion of
such invariant length intervals. The Lagrangian describing the motion of the object i ‘in

variation of A1 in (3.11) then has contributions from both ~j2 and ~x2 which yield, respectively, the last
two terms on the right side of (3.15).

5The right sides of these equations are ‘forces’ according to the relativistic generalisation of Newton’s
Second Law. In fact, however, the force concept does not appear at any place in their derivation. For an
interesting recent discussion of the force concept in modern physics see [6].

The relation (4.12) will be found to be important in the interpretation of the Maxwell
equation (4.17) as a description of radiation phenomena (creation of real photons). This
point will be brieﬂy discussed in Section 7 below.

The electrodynamic Maxwell equation (Amp`ere’s Law, including Maxwell’s ‘displace-
ment current’) is derived immediately on writing the electrostatic Maxwell equation (4.7)
in a covariant form. The latter then appears as an equation for the 0 component of a

5 Fundamental Concepts and Diﬀerent Levels of Math-

ematical Abstraction

Eqn(3.19) shows that the dynamics of any system of mutually interacting electrically
charged objects is completely speciﬁed by their masses, electric charges and 4-vector
positions and velocities. Other useful and important concepts of CEM such as the 4-
vector potential and electric and magnetic ﬁelds are completely speciﬁed, in terms of the
geometrical and kinematical conﬁguration of the charged objects by Eqn(3.21) for Aµ,
Eqns(3.11) and (3.21) for ~E and Eqns(3.12) and (3.21) for ~B. Historically, of course,
Faraday arrived at the concepts of electric and magnetic ﬁelds in complete ignorance of
the existence of elementary electric charges or of Special Relativity. With our present-day
understanding of both the existence of the former and the necessary constraints provided
by the latter, it can be seen that both the 4-vector potential and electric and magnetic
ﬁelds are, in fact, only convenient mathematical abstractions. The 4-vector potential is
at a ﬁrst level of abstraction. The phenomenologically most useful concepts of CEM, the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds are, in turn, completely speciﬁed by Aµ and so are at a second
level of abstraction from the fundamental and irreducible concepts (charged, interacting,
physical objects) of the theory.

Indeed, there is yet a third level of abstraction, the tensor F µν of the electromagnetic

ﬁeld deﬁned as:

F µν = ∂µAν

∂νAµ

−

(5.1)

(5.2)

This description was introduced by Einstein in his original paper on General Relativity [11]
in analogy with the tensor Gµν of the classical gravitational ﬁeld.
It has the merit of
enabling the electrostatic and electrodynamic Maxwell equations to be written as a single
compact equation7:

∂νF µν = 4πJ µ

As in the case of the introduction of electric and magnetic ﬁelds into the covariant Lorentz
force equation (3.10) to obtain the 3-vector version (3.14), a cumbersome equation is re-
duced to an elegant one, at the the cost of introducing a higher level of mathematical
abstraction. Viewed, however in the light of the strict criteria of Newton’s precept, Aµ,
~E, ~B and F µν, (although in the case of ~E and ~B extremely useful phenomenologically)
are certainly not ‘suﬃcient’ to explain, in any fundamental manner, the phenomena of
CEM. On the contrary, as shown above, Coulomb’s law and Special Relativity, given, of
course, the a priori existence of charged physical objects, do provide such a fundamental
description, in which the ‘ﬁelds’ of electromagnetism appear naturally by mathematical
substitution.
If all that was known of CEM was Eqn(5.2), it is hard to see any log-
ical path to derive from it the Lorentz Force and Boit and Savart Laws that actually
describe the results of laboratory experiments in CEM. However these laws, Eqn(5.2),
and the magnetostatic and magnetodynamic Maxwell equations (4.4) and (4.6) are all
necessary consequences of Coulomb’s Law, Special Relativity and Hamilton’s Principle.
The higher the level of mathematical abstraction, the more elegant the electrodynamic

of the subject.

Although Einstein spent some decades of his life in the unsuccessful attempt to realise
a unifying synthesis between the classical ﬁeld tensors F µν and Gµν he still made a clear
distinction between physical reality and mathematical abstraction[12]:

We have seen, indeed, that in a more complete analysis the energy tensor

regarded itself as a part, in fact the principle part, of the
electromagnetic field.

In

In fact, electrically charged particles and real and virtual photons (which are also
particles) are the true irreducible concepts of CEM. These are not the ‘principle part’ of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld but rather replace it in the most fundamental description of the
phenomena of CEM.

Since the only dynamical postulate in CEM is Coulomb’s Law, the only way to obtain
a deeper physical understanding is by a deeper understanding of this Law. Indeed, as
will be discussed in the following Section, this does seem to be possible by considering
the particle aspects of the microscopic underlying QED process, which is basically Møller
scattering: e−e−

6 Quantum Electrodynamical Foundations of Classi-

cal Electromagnetism

If the electrodynamical force is transmitted by particle exchange, and it is assumed that
the magnitude of the force is proportional to the number of interacting particles, which are
emitted isotropically by the source, the inverse square law follows from spatial geometry
and conservation of the number of particles8. However, in the Coulomb interaction the
exchanged particle is a virtual, not a real, photon. This means that it cannot always
be considered to move in a particular direction in space-time. It will be shown below,
however, that the Fourier transform of the momentum-space virtual photon propagator
does yield a space-time propagator with the 1/r dependence of the Coulomb potential,
which corresponds, in the classical limit, to an inverse square force law. Also, in the CM
frame of the interacting charged particles this interaction is instantaneous, as assumed in
the derivation of the classical Lagrangian (2.10).

According to QED, the Boit and Savart and Lorentz Force Laws are the classical limit
of Møller scattering for very large numbers of electrons at very large spatial separations.
Conversely, Møller scattering is the quantum limit of the Boit and Savart and Lorentz
Force Laws when each current contains a single electron and the spatial separation of
8A similar physical reasoning was followed by Kepler in his attempts to understand the gravitational
force. As however the agents of force were constrained to propagate in the plane of a planetary orbit
rather than in three spatial dimensions a 1/r force law was predicted [13].

the currents is very small. The fundamental quantum mechanical laws governing Møller
scattering do not change when many electrons, with macroscopic spatial separations,
participate in the observed physical phenomenon. A more fundamental understanding
of CEM is therefore provided, not by any kind of ﬁeld concept, but by properly taking
into account the existence of virtual photons, just as an analysis in terms of real photon
production is mandatory for a fundamental description of the radiative processes of CEM,
a subject beyond the scope of the present paper.

The invariant QED amplitude for Møller scattering by the exchange of a single virtual

It can be seen that the integrand in Eqn(6.6) has exactly the same j
j/r structure as
the potential energy term in the invariant CEM Lagrangian (2.9). Indeed this is to be
expected in the Feynman Path Integral (FPI) formulation of quantum mechanics [22]. The
physical meaning of Eqn(6.6) is that the total amplitude is given by integration over all
spatial positions: ~xA(tA), ~xB(tA) at time tA, and all times tA, of emission and absorption
9Actually there are two such amplitudes related by exchange of the identical ﬁnal state electrons. In
the present case, where the classical limit of CEM is under discussion, it suﬃces to consider only the
amplitude given by (6.1) in the limit q2
0. The contribution of the second amplitude is negligible in
this limit.

of a single virtual photon 11 in the scattering process: e−e−
e−e−. Since the virtual
photon is not observed, this is just a manifestation of quantum mechanial superposition:
a sum of diﬀerent probability amplitudes with the same initial and ﬁnal states. Notice
that the virtual photon propagates with inﬁnite velocity between the spatial positions
~xA, ~xB so that the ambiguity in the direction of propagation of the space-like virtual
photon (see Fig.1b and c) has no relevance. Thus QED predicts that virtual photons
produce instantaneous ‘action at a distance’ in the overall centre-of-mass frame of Møller
scattering. This is also implicit in the discussion of CEM in Sections 2 and 3 above,
since all forces are deﬁned at a ﬁxed time in the CM frame of the interacting charges.
The meaning of the retarded Li´enart-Wiechert [16] potentials and ‘causality’ in relation
to the instantaneous forces transmitted by space-like virtual photons is discussed in the
concluding section of this paper.

To examine more closely the connection between Eqn(6.6) and the FPI formalism,

consider the general FPI expression for a transition amplitudes [17]:

exchange of an inﬁnity of virtual photons emitted and absorbed at diﬀerent spatial positions and times.
All these virtual photons however have, according to Eqn(6.6), inﬁnite velocity.

Feynman’s path integral formulation of quantum mechanics also provides the explana-
tion of Hamilton’s Principle in classical mechanics, the third postulate in the derivation,
from ﬁrst principles, of CEM presented in this paper. For this, it is necessary to consider
the classical limit of the fundamental FPI formula (6.7) for a transition amplitude. The
action S in this formula is a functional of the diﬀerent space-time paths x(t). Writing ex-
plicitly the dependence on Planck’s constant, gives a multiplicative factor exp(iS[x(t)]/¯h)
If the paths x(t) are chosen such that the variation of S
in the transition amplitude.
is large in comparison to ¯h, this factor will exhibit rapid phase oscillations and give a
negligible contribution to the transition amplitude. If, however, the paths are chosen in
such a way that S is near to an extremum with respect to their variation, S will change
only very slowly from path to path, so that the contributions of diﬀerent paths have
have almost the same phase, resulting in a large contribution to the scattering amplitude.
The classical limit corresponds to ¯h
0, where only the path giving the extremum of S
contributes. This path is just the classical trajectory as deﬁned by Hamilton’s Principle.
This argument, that may be called the ‘Stationary Phase Principle’, was ﬁrst given by
Dirac in 1934 [19](see also Reference [20]) and was an important motivation for Feynman’s
space-time reformulation of the principles of quantum mechanics [17, 21].

At this point it can be truthfully said that there is ‘nothing left to explain’ for an
understanding of the fundamental physics of CEM, given the laws of special relativity and
quantum mechanics. The irreducible physical concepts are electrically charged physical
objects and space-like virtual photons. Coulomb’s Law is a consequence of the exchange

7 Discussion and Outlook

The starting point and aims of the present paper are very close to those of Feynman
and Wheeler in the early 1940’s when they attempted to reformulate CEM in terms of
direct inter-charge interactions without the a priori introduction of any electromagnetic
ﬁeld concept. In this way the inﬁnite self-energy terms associated with the electric ﬁeld
of a point charge are eliminated. As Feynman put it [22]:

You see then that my general plan was to first solve the classical

problem, to get rid of the infinite self-energies in the classical theory,
and to hope that when I made a quantum theory of it everything would be
just fine.

Feynman and Wheeler had a project to write three papers on the subject [23]. The
ﬁrst of these papers was to be a study of the classical limit of the quantum theory of
radiation. Feynman had yet to formulate his space-time version of QED, and this paper
was never written. In the remaining two papers [24, 25] it was proposed to introduce direct
interparticle action by including the eﬀects of both retarded and ‘advanced’ potentials
as well as an array of ‘absorbers’. As suggested by Dirac [26] half of the diﬀerence
between the retarded potential of an accelerated charge and of the ‘advanced’ potential
from the absorbers correctly predicts the known radiative damping force of CEM. The
second paper, [25], developed further this theory by exploiting the Fokker action principle
formulation of action-at-a-distance in CEM [27]. As stated in the introduction of this
paper, a description was being sought that was:

(a) well defined

(b) economical in postulates

(c) in agreement with experience

that is, in other words, in accordance with Newton’s ﬁrst ‘Rule of Reasoning in Philosophy’
quoted above. However, in order to reproduce the known results of CEM by such a
theory ‘advanced’ potentials had to be introduced. This immediately gives an apparent
breakdown of causality and the logical distinction between ‘past’, ‘present’ and ‘future’.
As concisely stated by Feynman and Wheeler themselves [25]:

The apparent conflict with causality begins with the thought:
present motion of a is affected by the future motion of b, then the
observation of a attributes a certain inevitabilty to the motion of b.
not this conclusion in conflict with our recognised ability to influence
the future motion of b?

if the

Is

Feynman and Wheeler then gave a rather artiﬁcial example (which the present writer

ﬁnds unconvincing) that was claimed to resolve this causal paradox.

17

In fact, Feynman and Wheeler were compelled to introduce ‘advanced’ potentials be-
cause they were assuming, as did also Fokker and earlier authors attempting to formulate
theories of direct interparticle action in CEM, that causality meant that no physical in-
ﬂuence could be transmitted faster than the speed of light in vacuum. This deﬁnition
of ‘causality’ seems to have been introduced into physics by C.F.Gauss in 1845 [28].
Somewhat later, C.Neumann proposed [29] that the electric potential responsible for in-
terparticle forces should be transmitted, not at the speed of light, but instantaneously,
like the gravitational force in Newton’s theory. As shown above, this is indeed how, in
QED, space-like virtual photons transmit the electromagnetic force between charged ob-
jects in their common CM frame. These two hypotheses will be refered to below below
as ‘Gaussian’ and ‘Neumann’ Causality. The fundamental Lagrangian of CEM describ-
ing the interaction of charged objects in this frame is the simple expression Eqn(3.16)
above, not the conjectured, and much more complicated, Fokker action that embodies
Gaussian Causality. It is important to stress that the instantaneous action-at-a-distance,
of Neumann Causality, which is just the limit of Gaussian Causality as c
, unlike
an ‘advanced’ potential, poses no logical problem of the inﬂuence of the future on the
present, as succinctly stated by Feynman and Wheeler in the above quotation.

→ ∞

It has been an unstated axiom of physics since the advent of Special Relativity a cen-
tury ago, that no physical inﬂuence can propagate faster than the speed of light, which
is certainly the limiting velocity of any physical object described by a time-like energy-
momentum 4-vector. However Einstein at the time when he invented special relativity,
and Feynman himself, at the time of his collaboration with Wheeler, were not aware of
the concept of the ‘virtual’ particles. The latter, associated with the space-time propaga-
tors introduced into QED by Feynman and Stueckelberg, may be described by space-like
energy-momentum 4-vectors. The instantaneous action-at-a-distance of the virtual pho-
tons in Møller scattering described by the invariant amplitude in Eqn(6.6) above, can be
simply understood from the relativistic kinematics of such virtual particles. The relativis-
tic velocity β = v/c of a particle in terms of its 3-momentum ~p and 4-momentum p is, in
general, given by the expression:

β =

Thus space-like virtual particles, for which, by deﬁnition: p
p < 0, are tachyons. For the
case of the virtual photons exchanged in the center-of-mass-system of Møller scattering

That the Feynman propagator for a massive particle violates Gaussian Causality was
pointed out by Feynman himself in his ﬁrst QED paper [30] and later discussed by him
in considerable detail [31]. This fact is also sometimes mentioned in books on Quantum
Field Theory, that otherwise make the contradictory claim that, in general, quantum
ﬁeld operators commute for space-like separations, so that, in consequence, no physical
inﬂuence can propagate faster than the speed of light12 The space time propagator of a
12For example in Reference [18] it is stated, in connection with the commutation relation for a pair of
scalar ﬁelds (Eqn(3.55) of
[18]) that: ‘Measurements at space time separated points do not interfere as
a consquence of locality and causality’, whereas in the discussion of the Feynman propagator GF (x) in
Section 1.3.1 it is stated that: ‘While the previous Green functions were zero outside the light cone this

kind [30]. For an on-shell particle, or a virtual particle propagating over a large proper
time interval, ∆τ , the propagator has a simpler functional dependence

For space-like separations: ∆x2 > ∆t2 appropriate for the virtual photons mediating the
Coulomb force, ∆τ is imaginary. This would imply an exponentially damped range of the
asociated force for the exchange of a massive particle13. Since, however, the pole mass of
the photon vanishes, no such damping occurs for the exchange of virtual photons. The
corresponding force law is then the same as for the exchange of real (‘on-shell’) particles,
that is, inverse square.

It is instructive to compare Feynman’s own discussion of the virtual photon propagator
in space-time [32] to the related one of the invariant amplitude for Møller scattering in
Section 6 above. Feynman writes out explicitly the 4-vector product in Eqn(6.1) to obtain:

The total interaction which includes the interaction of transverse

photons then gives rise to the retarded interaction.

This statement is not true when Tf i is evaluated in the CM frame. In this case: q2 =

~q2, Eqn(6.6) results and the whole interaction of the virtual photon is instantaneous.

It is amusing to note that a faint ‘ghost’ of Wheeler and Feynman’s ‘advanced’ and
‘retarded’ potentials subsists in the momentum space diagrams Fig.1b and 1c. The two
is not the case for GF (x) which has an exponential tail at negative x2.’ The GF (x) discussed here is
that corresponding to a classical ﬁeld , but the corresponding quantum propagator, SF (x), has a similar
property [30, 31].

is halved and

in the CM frame. Thus in the observer’s proper frame,

kinematically distinct situations (i) a virtual photon with momentum ~qA propagates from
~qA
current A to current B (Fig1b) and (ii) a virtual photon with momentum ~qB =
propagates from current B to current A (Fig1c) are completely equivalent descriptions of
the scattering process in the CM frame where tA = tB. As shown in Fig 2, however, this is
no longer the the case if the scattering process is observed in a diﬀerent inertial frame. In
Fig 2a the observer is moving with relativistic velocity β = 3/5 parallel to the direction of
~pB
doubled.
i
In Fig2b, the observer moves with the same velocity relative to the CM frame, parallel
to ~pA
i . In both cases it follows from momentum conservation that there is no possible
ambiguity between the momentum space conﬁgurations shown in Figs 2a and 2b. In Fig
2a the virtual photon must propagate from current A to B and so tB > tA, and in Fig 2b
from current B to A so that tA > tB. Assuming that the electrons are ultrarelativistic,
E
, and that the electrons scatter through π/4 rad in the CM frame, as shown in
Fig 1, the relativistic velocity of the virtual photon in the observer’s frame is β = 1.044
for both cases shown in Fig 2. Thus the causal description of scattering processes in
momentum space is frame dependent, but is ambiguous only in the CM frame. Because
of this ambiguity, in the kinematical conﬁguration of Fig 1a, the virtual photon γA can
be considered as the limit as tB −
0 of an ‘advanced’ interaction from A as seen by
B, whereas in Fig 1c γB corresponds to the limit as tB −
tA →
0 of a retarded interaction
produced by B that interacts with A. Since the two descriptions are equivalent the eﬀect
is the same as the tB −
0 limit of half the sum of the retarded interaction produced
by the current B and the ‘advanced’ interaction on it produced by the current A. This
is the ‘ghost’ of Feynman and Wheeler’s advanced and retarded potentials mentioned
above. The current A (B) behaves as the ‘absorber’ for the interactions of the current
B (A). Unlike in Feynman and Wheeler’s formulation however there is no radiation and
therefore no ‘radiation resistance’. The photons responsible for the intercharge interaction
are purely virtual.

As often emphasised by Feynman [33], QED is based on only three elementary ampli-
tudes describing, respectively, the propagation of electrons or photons from one space-time
point to another and the amplitude for an electron to absorb or emit a photon. The latter
is proportional to the classical electric charge of the electron. Since only kinematics, and
not the coupling constant of QED, changes when virtual photons are replaced by real ones
it should not be surprising if the various ﬁeld concepts introduced to describe the eﬀect
of the virtual photons that generate intercharge forces should also be able to provide a
description of the observed eﬀects of the creation and absorption of real photons. As will
now be shown, this is indeed the case.

A clear distinction should be made however, at the outset, between the ﬁelds so far
discussed in the present paper, representing the eﬀects of virtual photon exchange, and the
related ﬁelds denoted here as Arad, ~Erad and ~Brad that provide a description of physical
systems comprised of large numbers of real photons14. As discussed in a recent paper
by the present author [34], a complex representation of these radiation ﬁelds may be
identiﬁed, in the limit of very low photon density, with the quantum wavefunction of a
single real photon15

14This distinction is often not clearly made in text books on CEM
15This wavefunction occurs for example, in the construction of invariant amplitudes of all processes
in which real photons are created or destroyed. The related problem of ’non localisability’ of photons is

20

The electrodynamic Maxwell equation (4.20) as written above therefore describes only
the eﬀects of virtual photon exchange. All ﬁelds and currents are deﬁned at some unique
time in the CM frame of the interacting charges. The solutions of this equation are given
by Eqns(3.11), (3.12) and (3.1). To arrive at a description of real photons it is convenient
to express Eqn(4.20) uniquely in terms of the 3-vector potential by using the Lorentz
condition (4.12) to eliminate the scalar potential A0. The result of this simple exercise in
3-vector algebra, which may be found in any text-book on CEM, is:

The ‘radiation’ suﬃx has been added to ~A and ~J to distinguish them from the quantities
~A and ~J deﬁned in Eqns(3.1) and (4.8) since the latter are not solutions of Eqn(7.5) unless
c is inﬁnite. In fact, as shown for example in Reference [35], the solution of Eqn(7.5) is
similar to (3.1) except that it is retarded in time:

t
~r/c in the denominator of Eqn(7.5), ﬁrst calculated
by Li´enard and Wichert [16], takes into account the contributions from diﬀerent spatial
positions of the moving electric charge, of velocity ~v, to the retarded potential. It follows
that ~Arad(t) and the associated electromagnetic ﬁelds ~Erad(t) and ~Brad(t) describe some
physical eﬀect produced by the source current at time t
r/c, i.e. that propagates from
the source to the point of observation with velocity c. In reality, the energy-momentum,
ﬂux associated with the corresponding ‘electromagnetic wave’ produced by the source
consists of a very large number of real photons whose energy distribution depends on
the acceleration of the source at their moment of emission. Thus the solution (7.6) to
(7.5) implies the existence of massless physical objects (‘photons’) [36, 37], created by the
source current. As discussed in Reference [34], comparison of the known properties of
both photons and the classical electromagnetic waves associated with the ﬁelds Arad, ~Erad
and ~Brad enables many fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics to be understood in
a simple way.

−

Maxwell’s original discovery of electromagnetic waves [38] was based on an equation
similar to (7.5) for components of the electromagnetic ﬁelds, but without any source term,
which is just the well-known classical Wave Equation in three spatial dimensions Although
this procedure lead, in a heuristic manner, to the concept of ‘electromagnetic waves’
propagating at speed c, with vast practical, political and sociological consequences, it can
be seen, with hindsight, to have been a mistake from the viewpoint of fundamental physics.
In fact, if the current vanishes, so, by deﬁnition, do all the ﬁelds whether instantaneous
as in Eqn(3.1) or retarded as in Eqn(7.5). If all the ﬁelds vanish there can evidently be
no ‘waves’. The result of this mistake was many decades of fruitless work by Maxwell
and others to invent a medium (the luminiferous aether) in which such ‘sourceless’ waves
might propagate and whose properties would predict the value of c. Now it is understood
that the energy density ( ~E2
rad + ~B2
rad)/8π of a plane ‘elecromagnetic wave’ is simply that
of the beam of real photons of which it actually consists [34].

discussed in Reference [34].

The existence of photons, massless particles with constant velocity c, is predicted by
Eqn(7.5) that necessarily follows from Eqns(4.12) and (4.20). These in turn may be de-
rived from the Lagrangian (2.10) and Hamilton’s Principle. It is then interesting to ask
where the constant ‘c’ was introduced into the derivation. The answer is Eqn(2.2), the
deﬁnition of 4-vector velocity. The same formula contains, implicitly, the information that
a massless particle has the constant velocity, c , that is used to identify the ’electromag-
netic wave’ with velocity c predicted by Eqns(7.5) and (7.6) with the propagation of the
massless real photons produced by the source.

The only dynamical assumption in the derivation of CEM presented above is Coulomb’s
Law. If it is explained in QED as an eﬀect due to virtual photon exchange, it also seems to
require via Eqns(7.5) and (7.6), the existence of real, massless, photons. Although clearly
of interest, the further study of the relationship between CEM and QED for radiative
processes is, as stated earlier, beyond the scope of the present paper.

In conclusion, the results obtained in the present paper are compared with those of
the similarly motivated project of Feynman and Wheeler. The latter made the following
general comments on their approach [25]:

(1)

There is no such concept as ‘‘the’’ field, an independent entity

with degrees of freedom of its own.

(2) There is no action of an elementary charge upon itself and

consequently no problem of an infinity in the energy of the electromagnetic
field.

(3) The symmetry between past and future in the prescription of the

fields not a mere logical possibility, as in the usual theory, but a
postulational requirement.

The statements (1) and (2) remain true in the approach described in Sections 2-4
above. However the writers’s opinion is that the ‘inﬁnite self energy’ problem of CEM
is really an artifact of the possibly unphysical concept of a ‘point charge’ rather than
a shortcoming of the classical electromagnetic ﬁeld concept per se. That being said, it
remains true that the virtual photons interacting with a given charge are produced by
other charges so there is no way for the charge to ‘interact with itself’.
If the energy
of the ‘electromagentic ﬁeld’ is identiﬁed with that of the exchanged virtual photons in
the CM frame, it vanishes, so, there is, as in (2) above, certainly no self energy problem.
However, the statements (1)and (2) are only applicable to the ‘force’ ﬁelds introduced
in Eqns(3.1), (3.10) and (3.12) above, that may be denoted as Af or, ~Ef or and ~Bf or to
It is important to
distingish them from the ‘radiation’ ﬁelds describing real photons.
reiterate that the deﬁnitions and physical meanings of these two types of ﬁelds are quite
distinct. The quantity: ( ~E2
f or)/8π does not correctly describe the energy density
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld associated with virtual photons, and, in contradiction to (1),
extra degrees of freedom must be added to the Lagrangian to correctly describe real
photons. No distinction was made between real and virtual photons by Feynman and
Wheeler. In the approach of the present paper, point (3) with its introduction of acausal
‘advanced’ potentials is no longer valid. It was a consequence of Feynman and Wheeler’s
taking Gaussian Causality as an axiom. The latter is true, as shown by Eqn(7.6), for any

f or + ~B2

22

interaction transmitted by real photons (i.e. for the ﬁelds Arad, ~Erad and ~Brad) but not, as
shown in Section 5 above, for the force ﬁelds describing the eﬀects of the exchange of space-
like virtual photons. These are always tachyonic (as in Fig.2) and may be instantaneous
(as in Fig1b and c) but do not, unlike ‘advanced potentials’, violate causality. Feynman
and Wheeler’s mistake, the same as that of many previous authors, was to try to describe
the physical eﬀects of virtual photon exchange by ﬁelds repecting Gaussian, instead of
Neumann, Causality.

Finally the approach of the present paper may be compared with that of another
recent paper by the present author [7] in which the Lorentz Force Law, magnetic ﬁeld
concept and the Faraday-Lenz Law are derived from a diﬀerent set of postulates. The
electrostatic deﬁnition of the electric ﬁeld ~Estat =
V is ﬁrst generalised to the covariant
form of Eqn(3.11) above by imposing space-time exchange symmetry invariance [10]. The
magnetic ﬁeld concept and the Lorentz Force Law are then shown to follow from the
covariance of Eqn(3.11), and the derivation of the Faraday-Lenz law is identical to that
given above. Neither Coulomb’s Law nor Hamilton’s Principle were invoked in this case,
demonstrating the robustness of some essential formulae of CEM to the choice of axioms
for their derivation.

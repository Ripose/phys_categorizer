Abstract

Modern ether-drift experiments look for a preferred frame by measuring the diﬀerence ∆ν in

the relative frequencies of two cavity-stabilized lasers, upon local rotations of the apparatus

or under the Earth’s rotation.

If the small deviations observed in the classical ether-drift

experiments were not mere instrumental artifacts, by replacing the high vacuum in the res-

onating cavities with a dielectric gaseous medium (e.g. air), the typical measured ∆ν

1 Hz

should increase by orders of magnitude. This prediction is consistent with the characteristic

∼

modulation of a few kHz observed in the original experiment with He-Ne masers. However,

if such enhancement would not be conﬁrmed by new and more precise data, the existence of

a preferred frame can be deﬁnitely ruled out.

1. The controversy about the existence of a preferred reference frame dates back to the

birth of the Theory of Relativity, i.e.

to the basic diﬀerences between Einstein’s Special

Relativity [1] and the Lorentz-Poincar´e point of view [2, 3]. Today the former interpretation

is generally accepted. However, the conceptual relevance of retaining a physical substratum

as an important element of the physical theory [4], may induce to re-discover the potentially

profound implications of the latter [5, 6]. For instance, replacing the empty space-time of

Special Relativity with a preferred frame, one gets a diﬀerent view of the non local aspects

of the quantum theory, see Refs.[7, 8].

Another argument that might induce to re-consider the idea of a preferred frame was given

in Ref.[9]. The argument was based on the simultaneous presence of two ingredients that are

often found in present-day elementary particle physics, namely: a) vacuum condensation, as

with the Higgs ﬁeld in the electroweak theory, and b) an approximate form of locality, as with

cutoﬀ-dependent, eﬀective quantum ﬁeld theories. In this case, one is faced with ‘reentrant

violations of special relativity in the low-energy corner’ [10]. These are deviations at small

< δ where the infrared scale δ vanishes, in units of the Lorentz-invariant scale

M of the theory, only in the local limit of the continuum theory Λ
ultraviolet cutoﬀ. A simple interpretation of the phenomenon, in the case of a condensate

, Λ being the

M → ∞

of spinless quanta, is in terms of density ﬂuctuations of the system [11, 12], the continuum

theory corresponding to the incompressibility limit. The resulting picture of the ground state

is closer to a medium with a non-trivial refractive index [9] than to the empty space-time of

Special Relativity.

Therefore, in the presence of a non-trivial vacuum, it is natural to explore whether the

physically realized form of the Theory of Relativity is closer to the Einstein’s formulation or to

the original Lorentzian approach with a preferred frame. In other words, the same relativistic
eﬀects between two observers S′ and S′′, rather than being due to their relative motion, might
be interpreted as arising from their individual motion with respect to some preferred frame Σ.

This equivalence is a simple consequence of the group structure of Lorentz transformations,
where the relative velocity parameter βrel connecting S′ to S′′ can be expressed in terms of
the individual velocity parameters β′ and β′′ respectively relating S′ and S′′ to Σ as

(we restrict for simplicity to one-dimensional motions).

In this perspective, the crucial question becomes the following: can the individual param-
eters β′ and β′′ be determined separately through ether-drift experiments ? Accepting the

−

standard ‘null-result’ interpretation of this type of experiments, this is not possible. There-

fore, if really only βrel is experimentally measurable, one is driven to conclude (as Einstein

did in 1905 [1]) that the introduction of a preferred frame is ‘superﬂuous’, all eﬀects of Σ
being re-absorbed into the relative space-time units of any pair (S′, S′′).

On the other hand, if the ether-drift experiments give a non-null result, so that β′ and
β′′ can be separately determined, then the situation is completely diﬀerent. In fact, now βrel
is a derived quantity and the Lorentzian point of view is uniquely singled out.

Due to the importance of the problem, we have ﬁrst re-considered the classical ether-drift

experiments, our main motivation being that, according to some authors, their standard null-

result interpretation is not so obvious. The fringe shifts observed in the various Michelson-

Morley type of experiments, although smaller than the classical predictions, were never really

negligibly small. Interpreting these small deviations on the base of Ref.[9], a narrow experi-

mental window might still be compatible with the existence of a preferred frame.

After this ﬁrst part, we have concentrated our analysis on the modern ether-drift experi-

ments, those where the observation of the interference fringes is replaced by the diﬀerence ∆ν

in the relative frequencies of two cavity-stabilized lasers upon local rotations of the apparatus

[13] or under the Earth’s rotation [14]. It turns out that, even in this case, the most recent

data [14] leave some space for a non-null interpretation of the experimental results.

For this reason, we shall propose a sharp experimental test that can deﬁnitively decide

about the existence of a preferred frame. If the small deviations found in the classical ex-

periments were not mere instrumental artifacts, by replacing the high vacuum used in the

resonating cavities with a dielectric gaseous medium, the typical frequency of the signal

should increase from values ∆ν

1 Hz up to ∆ν

100 kHz, using air, or up to ∆ν

kHz, using helium. The latter prediction appears to be consistent with the characteristic

modulation of a few kHz in the magnitude of the ∆ν’s observed by Jaseja et al.

[15] using

He-Ne masers.

2. A non-null result of the original Michelson-Morley [16] experiment was strongly ad-

vocated by Hicks [17] long time ago. The same conclusion was obtained by Miller after his

re-analysis of the Michelson-Morley data, of the Morley-Miller [18] experiments and of his

own measurements at Mt.Wilson, see Fig.4 of Ref.[19]. Miller’s reﬁned analysis showed that

all data were consistent with an eﬀective, observable velocity lying in the range 7-10 km/s,

say

∼

expected, on the base of classical physics, for the Earth’s orbital velocity of 30 km/s.

The diﬀerence of the value in Eq.(2) with respect to the original conclusion of Michelson-

Morley (vobs certainly smaller than 1/4 of the Earth’s orbital velocity [16]), can partly be

understood looking at the conclusions of the Hicks’ study [17]: one is not allowed to average

data of diﬀerent experimental sessions unless one is sure that the direction of the ether-

drift eﬀect remains the same (see page 34 of [17] “It follows that averaging the results of

diﬀerent days in the usual manner is not allowable...If this is not attended to, the average

displacement may be expected to come out zero...”).

In other words, the ether-drift, if it

exists, has a vectorial nature. Therefore, rather than averaging the raw data from the various

sessions, one should ﬁrst consider the data from the i-th experimental session and extract

the observable velocity vobs(i) and the ether-drift direction θo(i) for that session. Finally, a

mean magnitude

and a mean direction

can be obtained by averaging the individual

θo

determinations (see Figs. 22 of Ref.[19]).

Now, following the latter strategy, the magnitude of the observable velocity comes out

to be larger, its error becomes smaller so that the evidence for an ether-drift eﬀect becomes

stronger (see page 36 of Ref.[17] “ ...this naturally leads to the reconsideration of the numerical

data obtained by Michelson and Morley, who did lump together the observations taken in

diﬀerent days. I propose to show that, instead of giving a null result, the numerical data

published in their paper show distinct evidence of an eﬀect of the kind to be expected”).

The same was true for the Morley-Miller data [18]. In this case, the morning and evening

observations each were indicating an eﬀective velocity of about 7.5 km/s (see Fig.11 of

Ref.[19]). This indication was completely lost after averaging the raw data as in Ref.[18].

Finally, the same point of view has been advocated by M´unera in his recent re-analysis of

the classical experiments [20].

3. Now, suppose we accept the value in Eq.(2) to summarize the results of the Michelson-

Morley, Morley-Miller and Miller experiments. As these were performed in air, it would mean

that the measured two-way speed of light diﬀers from an exactly isotropical value

air denoting the refractive index of the air. Namely, for an observer placed on the Earth

(

On the other hand, for the Kennedy’s [21] experiment, where the whole optical system

was inclosed in a sealed metal case containing helium at atmospheric pressure, the observed

anisotropy was deﬁnitely smaller. In fact, the accuracy of the experiment, such to exclude

fringe shifts as large as 1/4 of those expected on the base of Eq.(2) (or 1/50 of that expected

on the base of a velocity of 30 km/s) allows to place an upper bound vobs < 4 km/s. This is

conﬁrmed by the re-analysis of the Illingworth’s experiment [22] performed by M`unera [20]

who pointed out some incorrect assumptions in the original analysis of the data. From this

re-analysis, the relevant observable velocity turns out to be vobs = 3.1

1.0 km/s (errors at

the 95% C.L.) [20], with typical fringe shifts that were 1/100 of that expected for a velocity of

30 km/s. Again, this means that, for an apparatus ﬁlled with gaseous helium at atmospheric

pressure, the measured two-way speed of light diﬀers from the exactly isotropical value

Finally, for the Joos experiment [23], performed in an evacuated housing and where any

ether-wind was found smaller than 1.5 km/s, the typical value vobs

1 km/s means that, in

that particular type of vacuum, the fringe shifts were smaller than 1/400 of those expected

for an Earth’s velocity of 30 km/s and the anisotropy of the two-way speed of light was at

the level

10−11.

∼

We shall try to summarize the above experimental results as follows. When light propa-

gates in a gaseous medium, the exactly isotropical value

holds approximately for an observer placed on the Earth. Within the context of a Theory

of Relativity with a preferred frame, this should not come as a complete surprise. In fact,

the usual assumption, that the isotropical value Eq.(4) holds exactly in the reference frame
S′ where the gas is in thermodynamical equilibrium, reﬂects the point of view of Special
Relativity with no preferred frame. However, to test this assumption requires precisely to

perform a Michelson-Morley experiment and look for fringe shifts upon local rotations of the

apparatus.

When this is done, the experiments indicate a slight anisotropy that becomes smaller when

the refractive index of the medium approaches unity. In fact vobs, and thus the anisotropy, is

larger for those interferometers operating in air, where

preserve the isotropical value of the speed of light in the vacuum c = 2.9979...

∼

If these are valid, even in the presence of a preferred frame, no anisotropy can be detected

studying light propagation in the vacuum where

vacuum = 1 identically.

N

However, Lorentz transformations do not preserve the value of the speed of light in a
medium. Therefore, the simplest way to generate an anisotropy in S′ is to start from the
isotropical value Eq.(4), assumed to be valid in some preferred frame Σ, and compute its
value in S′ through a Lorentz transformation.

·

Notice that this series of steps is completely analogous to the conventional treatment

of the Michelson-Morley experiment. There, one starts from the isotropical value c in Σ

and uses Galileian relativity (for which the speed of light becomes c
v) to transform to
the observer S′ placed in the Earth’s frame. Here we shall only take into account that i)
light propagates in a gaseous medium and ii) Galilei’s trasformations have to be replaced by

±

Lorentz transformations.

There is, however, a hidden assumption in our procedure that should be clearly spelled out.

Eq.(4) is strictly valid for a medium at rest in the preferred frame Σ. However, the medium
is at rest in S′ and not in Σ. Therefore, strictly speaking, before Lorentz transforming to
S′, we should ﬁrst correct the Σ estimate for the eﬀect of the Fresnel’s drag that might exist
anyway. Of course, if we had to use the exact relativistic formula to compute this eﬀect and
then transform to S′, we would obtain that the isotropical value Eq.(4) holds in S′ as well.
Here, following the experimental indications of a non-zero anisotropy in S′, we shall assume
that the Fresnel’s drag for Σ is negligible, at least for gaseous media, so that the anisotropy
in S′ is due to the genuine Lorentz transformation. This assumption reﬂects the point of
view that, if there is really a preferred frame, there must be somewhere a basic asymmetry
between Σ and S′. We stress, however, that our assumption of a negligible Fresnel’s drag in
Σ cannot be extended to light propagation in solid dielectrics with high refractive index. In

fact, Michelson-Morley experiments performed in a solid transparent medium (perspex) [24],

where

The peculiar role of gaseous media can partly be understood noticing that they cover the

N
starts to diﬀer sizeably from unity, the Fresnel’s drag in Σ becomes substantial so as to cancel
the eﬀect of the genuine Lorentz transformation to S′. In this new regime, light propagates
isotropically in the rest frame of the medium. Just for this reason, experiments performed

in gaseous media represent the only remaining window to detect the possible existence of a

preferred frame.

Within the above assumptions, starting from Eq.(4) and denoting by v the velocity of
S′ with respect to Σ, a Lorentz transformation give the general expression for the one-way

For instance, for the Michelson-Morley experiment, and for an ether wind along the x axis,

that corresponds to a pure second-harmonic eﬀect as in the old theory (see for instance
Refs.[17, 25]) where v2 is replaced by v2

of space, embodied in the validity of Lorentz transformations, the measured length of an
interferometer at rest in S′ is D regardless of its orientation.

Also, the trend predicted by Eqs.(13) and (14), where the observable velocity, and thus

the anisotropy, becomes smaller and smaller when

medium approaches unity, is consistent

with the analysis of the experiments performed by Kennedy, Illingworth and Joos vs. those of

N

Michelson-Morley, Morley-Miller and Miller. We note that a qualitatively similar suppression

eﬀect had already been discovered by Cahill and Kitto [26] by following a diﬀerent approach.

4. As stressed in Ref.[9], the detection of a preferred frame in ether-drift experiments

is a purely experimental issue. Within our assumptions, this requires:

i) the preliminary

observation of fringe shifts upon operation of the interferometer and ii) that their magnitude,

observed with diﬀerent gaseous media and within the experimental errors, points consistently

to a unique value of the kinematical Earth’s velocity. Only in this case, one can conclude

that there is experimental evidence for the existence of a preferred frame.

The conclusion of Cahill and Kitto [26] is that the classical experiments are consistent with

the value vearth

background radiation. However, in our expression Eq.(13) determining the fringe shifts there
is a diﬀerence of a factor √3 with respect to their result vobs = v√kmedium. Therefore,
1.00029, the relevant Earth’s velocity (in the plane of the

In this way, using our Eq.(13), the kinematical Earth’s velocity becomes consistent with the

epochs of the year [19]. In fact, the typical daily values, in the plane of the interferometer,

on one hand, increases the body of experimental evidence for a preferred frame, and on the

other hand, provides a deﬁnite range of velocities to be used in the analysis of the other

experiments.

To this end, let us compare with the experiment performed by Michelson, Pease and

Pearson [28]. These other authors in 1929, using their own interferometer, again at Mt.

Wilson, declared that their “precautions taken to eliminate eﬀects of temperature and ﬂexure

disturbances were eﬀective”. Therefore, their statement that the fringe shift, as derived

from “...the displacements observed at maximum and minimum at sidereal times...”, was

deﬁnitely smaller than “...one-ﬁfteenth of that expected on the supposition of an eﬀect due

to a motion of the Solar System of three hundred kilometres per second”, can be taken as an

indirect conﬁrmation of our Eq.(15). Indeed, although the “one-ﬁfteenth” was actually a “one-

ﬁftieth” (see page 240 of Ref.[19]), their fringe shifts were certainly non negligible. This is

easily understood since, for an in-air-operating interferometer, the fringe shift (∆λ)class(300),

expected on the base of classical physics for an Earth’s velocity of 300 km/s, is about 500

times bigger than the corresponding relativistic one

As such, it poses no strong restrictions and is entirely consistent with those typical low

observable velocities reported in Eq.(2).

A similar agreement is obtained when comparing with the Illingworth’s data [22] as

recently re-analyzed by M´unera [20].

5. Let us ﬁnally consider those present-day, ‘high vacuum’ Michelson-Morley experiments

of the type ﬁrst performed by Brillet and Hall [13] and more recently by M¨uller et al. [14].

In these experiments, the test of the isotropy of the speed of light does not consist in the

observation of the interference fringes as in the classical experiments. Rather, one looks for

the diﬀerence ∆ν in the relative frequencies of two cavity-stabilized lasers upon local rotations

of the apparatus [13] or under the Earth’s rotation [14].

The present experimental value for the anisotropy of the two-way speed of light in the

vacuum, as determined by M¨uller et al.[14],

due to the vanishingly small value of Bvacuum. For this reason, a more eﬃcient search might

be performed in dielectric gaseous media. As a check, we have compared with the only

available results obtained by Jaseja et. al [15] in 1963 when looking at the relative frequency

shifts of two orthogonal He-Ne masers placed on a rotating platform. As we shall show in

the following, their data are consistent with the same type of conclusion obtained from the

classical experiments: an ether-drift eﬀect determined by an Earth’s velocity as in Eq.(15).

To use the experimental results reported by Jaseja et al.[15] one has to subtract pre-

liminarly a large overall systematic eﬀect that was present in their data and interpreted by

the authors as probably due to magnetostriction in the Invar spacers induced by the Earth’s

magnetic ﬁeld. As suggested by the same authors, this spurious eﬀect, that was only aﬀecting

the normalization of the experimental ∆ν, can be subtracted looking at the variations of the

data at diﬀerent hours of the day. The data for ∆ν, in fact, in spite of their rather large

errors, exhibit a characteristic modulation (see Fig.3 of Ref.[15]) with a maximum at about

7:30 a.m. and a minimum at about 9:00 a.m. and a typical diﬀerence [15]

To evaluate the above ratio of velocities, let us ﬁrst compare the modulation of ∆ν seen in

ﬁg.3 of ref.[15] with that of vobs in ﬁg.27 of ref.[19] (data plotted as a function of civil time

as in ref.[15]) restricting to the Miller’s data of February, the period of the year that is closer

to the date of January 20th when Jaseja et al. performed their experiment. Further, the

diﬀerent location of the two laboratories (Mt.Wilson and Boston) can be taken into account

with a shift of about three hours so that Miller’s interval 3:00 a.m.

is made to

12:00 a.m. of Jaseja et al.. If this is done, although one

does not expect an exact correspondence due to the diﬀerence between the two epochs of the

year, the two characteristic trends are surprisingly close.

Thus we shall try to use the Miller’s data for a rough evaluation of the ratio reported

in Eq.(30). In this case, rescaling from vobs to vearth through Eq.(13) (for the Miller’s inter-

ferometer that was operating in air), we obtain values of

eﬀect is correctly reproduced.

This suggests, once more [9], to perform a new class of ether-drift experiments in dielectric

Therefore, it becomes natural to explore the existence of a preferred frame and formulate

deﬁnite predictions for the relative frequency shift ∆ν which is measured in the present-day

experiments with cavity-stabilized lasers, upon local rotation of the apparatus or under the

Earth’s rotation. In this case, our basic relation is

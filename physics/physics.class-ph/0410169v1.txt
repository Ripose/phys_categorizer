Abstract

We discuss transormation laws of electric and magnetic ﬁelds under Lorentz
transformations, deduced from the Classical Field Theory. It is found that we
can connect the resulting expression for a bivector formed with those ﬁelds,
with the expression deduced from the Wigner transformation rules for spin-1
functions of massive particles. This mass parameter should be interpreted
because the constancy of speed of light forbids the existence of the photon
mass.

I. INTRODUCTION

Within the Classical Electrodynamics (CED) we can obtain transformation rules for
electric and magnetic ﬁelds when we pass from one frame to another which is moving with
respect to the former with constant velocity; in other words, we can obtain the relationships
between the ﬁelds under Lorentz transformations or boosts. On the other hand we have that
electromagnetic waves are constituted of “quanta” of the ﬁelds, which are called photons.
It is usually accepted that photons do not have mass. Furthermore, the photons are the
particles which can be in the eigenstates of helicities ±1. The dynamics of such ﬁelds is
described by the Maxwell equations on the classical level. On the other hand, we know
the Weinberg-Tucker-Hammer formalism [1,2] which describe spin-1 massive particles. The
massless limit of the Weinberg-Tucker-Hammer formalism can be well-deﬁned in the light-
cone basis [3].

In this work we show how these two viewpoints can be related.

II. THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATIONS FOR ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD
PRESENTED BY BIVECTOR

In the Classical Electrodynamics we know the following equations to transform electric

and magnetic ﬁelds under Lorentz transformations [4]

E′ = γ(E + β × B) −

β(β · E)

B′ = γ(B − β × E) −

where γ = 1/

we have

Now we introduce a particular representation of S matrices (generators of rotations for spin
1): (Si)jk = −iǫijk, i.e.

0 0 0
0 0 −i

Using the relation ǫijkǫlmk = δilδjm − δimδjl (the Einstein sum rule on the repeated indices
is assumed), we have for an arbitrary vector a:

So with the help of the S matrices we can write (3,4) like

(S · a)2

ij = a2δij − aiaj .

or

Now, let us take into account that β-parameter is related to the momentum and the energy
in the following way: when we diﬀerentiate E2−p2c2 = m2c4 we obtain 2EdE−2c2p·dp = 0,
hence dE
mc2 , where we must interpretate m like some
dp
mass parameter (as in [5, p.43]). It is rather related not to the photon mass but to the
particle mass, with which we associate the second frame (the energy and the momentum as
well). So, we have

E = v = cβ. Then, we set γ = E

Note that we have started from the transformation equations for the ﬁelds, which do not
involve any mass and, according to the general wisdom, they should describe massless par-
ticles.

III. THE LORENTZ TRANSFORMATIONS FOR MASSIVE SPIN-1 PARTICLES
IN THE WEINBERG-TUCKER-HAMMER FORMALISM

When we want to consider Lorentz transformations and derive relativistic quantum equa-
tions for quantum-mechanical state functions, we ﬁrst have to work with the representations
of the quantum-mechanical Lorenz group. These representations have been studied by E.
Wigner [6]. In order to consider the theories with deﬁnite-parity solutions of the correspond-
ing dynamical equations (the ’deﬁnite-parity’ means that the solutions are the eigenstates of
the spatial reﬂection operation), we have to look for a function formed by two components
(called the “right” and “left” components),ref [5]. According to the Wigner rules, we have
the following expressions

φR(pµ) = ΛR(pµ ←

φL(pµ) = ΛL(pµ ←

0
pµ)φR(

0
pµ)φL(

0
pµ),
0
pµ)

where

0
pµ= (E, 0) is the 4-momentum at rest, pµ is the 4-momentum in the 2nd frame (where

a particle has 3-momentum p, c = ¯h = 1). In the case of spin S, ψ =

is called

φR(pµ)
φL(pµ) (cid:19)

(cid:18)

the Weinberg 2(2S + 1) function [1]. Let us consider the case of S = 1. The matrices ΛR,L
are then the matrices of the (1, 0), (0, 1) representations of the Lorentz group, respectively.
Their explicite forms are (φ = nφ)

ΛR,L = exp(±S · φ) = 1 + (S · ˆn)2

or

exp(±S · φ) = 1 + (S · ˆn)2(cosh φ − 1) ± (S · ˆn) sinh φ .

If we introduce the parametrizations cosh φ = E

m, sinh φ = |

p

|m , ˆn = p

, see [5, p.39-43],

c = ¯h = 1, we obtain

Thus, the equations (15, 16) are written as

ΛR(pµ ←

pµ) = 1 +

ΛL(pµ ←

pµ) = 1 −

(22)

If we compare the equations (21,22) with the equation (14) we see that E − iB can be
considered as φR, E + iB can be considered as φL.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have found that when we introduce a mass parameter in the equation (13) we can
make the equation (14) and the equations (15, 16) to coincide. This result suggests we have
to attribute the mass parameter to the frame and not to the electromagnetic-like ﬁelds. This
should be done in order to preserve the postulate which states that all inertial observers must
measure the same speed of light. Moreover, our considertion illustrates a sutuation in which
we have to distinguish between passive and active transformations.

We are grateful to Sr. Alfredo Casta˜neda for discussions in the classes of quantum

mechanics at the University of Zacatecas.

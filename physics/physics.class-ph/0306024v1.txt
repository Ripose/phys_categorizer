Abstract

We analyze the motion of an electron in the crossed electromagnetic ﬁeld of the
planar magnetron. Numerically we calculate the parameters of cycloid along which
electron moves. We determine the total power of radiation of an electron moving
in the magnetron and the power spectrum generated by a single electron and by
the system of N electrons moving coherently in the electromagnetic ﬁeld of planar
magnetron. We argue that for large N, and high intensity of electric and magnetic
ﬁelds, the power of radiation of such magnetronic laser, MAL, can be suﬃcient for
application in the physical, chemical, biological and medicine sciences. In medicine,
the magnetronic laser, can be used for the therapy of the localized cancer tumors.
The application of the MAL in CERN as an ion source for LHC is not excluded.

1 Introduction

Any of devices that produces an intensive beam of light not only of a very pure single
colour but all colours is a laser. While the gas lasers and masers produce practically a
single colour, the so called lasers on the free electrons such as undulators and wigglers
produce all spectrum of colours. These spectra are generated in the form of so called
synchrotron radiation because they are generated during the motion of electron when
moving in the magnetic ﬁeld.

The electrons moving inside the planar magnetron evidently produce also the syn-
chrotron radiation because planar magnetron is a system of two metal charged plates im-
mersed into homogenous magnetic ﬁeld which is perpendicular to the homogenous electric
ﬁeld between plates. The planar magnetron producing photons has the same function as
the free electron laser such as wiggler or undulator. So, we denote such device by word
magnetronic laser, or shortly MAL. The motion of electrons is determined by the equation
of motion following from electrodynamic of charges in homogenous electric and magnetic
ﬁeld. The produced energy of electrons is given by the Larmor formula.

History teaches us that Van de Graaﬀ (1931), Cockcroft and Walton (1932) used the
high voltage principle system for the acceleration of particles and that the next revolution
in acceleration physics was caused by Lawrence (Lawrence et al., 1932) who replaced the
high voltage acceleration by repeated acceleration of particles moving along the circle.
Here, we use the high voltage idea with the diﬀerence, to obtain synchrotron radiation
only and not to obtain high energy particles.

Although the radiation of one electron from one trajectory is very weak, the total
radiation of a MAL is not weak because the process of radiation can be realized by many
electrons moving along the same trajectory. There is no problem for today technology to
construct MAL of high intensity electric and magnetic ﬁelds. We hope that the radiation
output of such device is suﬃcient large for application in an physical laboratories.

We argue that MAL can be applied for instance in the therapy of cancer and it means
that in the speciﬁc situations it can be used instead of Leksell gamma knife. On the other
hand, the application of MAL in CERN as the ion source for LHC is not excluded.

2 The nonrelativistic motion of an electron in the

ﬁeld conﬁguration of the planar magnetron

We shall identify the direction of magnetic ﬁeld H with z-axis and he direction of electric
ﬁeld E is along the y-axis. Then, the nonrelativistic equation of motion of an electron is
as follows:

e
c
This equation can be rewritten in the separate coordinates as follows (we do not write

m ˙v = eE +

H).

where

ω0 = eH/mc.

Function ˙x+ i ˙y can be considered as the unknown, and as a such is equal to the sum of
the integral of the same diﬀerential equation without the right-hand term and a particular
integral of the equation with the right-hand term. The ﬁrst integral is ae−iω0t, and the
second integral is a constant which can be eliminated from eq. (4) as eEy/mω0 = cEy/H.
Thus

˙x + i ˙y = ae−iω0t +

cEy
H

.

The constant a is in general complex. So, we can write it in the form a = beiα where b
and α are real constants. We see that since a is multiplied by e−iω0t, we can, by a suitable
choice of the time origin, give the phase α any arbitrary value. We choose a to be real.
Then, breaking up ˙x + i ˙y into real and imaginary parts, we ﬁnd

˙x = a cos ω0t +

At t = 0 the velocity is along the x-axis (for a

necessary in particular that the electric and magnetic intensities satisfy the following
condition:

while the absolute magnitudes of E and H can be arbitrary.

These equations deﬁne in a parametric form a trochoid. Depending on whether a
is larger or smaller in absolute value than the quantity cEy/H, the projection of the
trajectory on the plane xy have diﬀerent form.
cEy/H, then, equation (7) becomes:

These equations are the parametric equation of cycloid in the plane xy. The cycloid
can be formed also mechanically as a curve traced out by a point on the circumference
of a circle that rolls without slipping along a straight line. Constant R = cEy/ω0H is
equal to the radius of the rolling circle. The distance from the point with parameter t = 0
to the point with parameter t = 2π/ω0 is 2πR. The drift velocity is Rω0 and it is the
velocity of the center of the circle.

On the other hand we see that the average value of ˙x is just the drift velocity vdrif t in

The generalization to the relativistic situation can be performed using the approach

equation (9).

of Landau et all. (1962).

The aim of this article is to investigate the radiation of electron in case that the motion
is just along cycloid, i. e. the trajectory of an electron in the planar magnetron. We want
to show that such conﬁguration of ﬁelds is an experimental device which can be used as
the new eﬀective source of synchrotron radiation.

For the sake of simplicity we calculate spectrum of radiation of MAL in the system
S′ which moves with regard to the magnetron at the drift velocity vdrif t = Rω0. Then,
all electron trajectories are circles and the radiation of this system is the synchrotron
radiation. Then, we can transform the power spectrum to the system joined with the
planar magnetron. However, we shall see that the spectrum is modiﬁed slightly, because
the drift velocity is not relativistic in our situation.

The motion of electrons diﬀers form the motion of electrons in wigglers and undulators
where the trajectories of electrons are not cycloids and the motion is highly relativistic.
It is also possible to realize the relativistic motion of electrons in MAL. However, it

needs special experimental conditions which are very expensive.

3 Physical design of MAL

The expression for the instantaneous power radiated by the nonrelativistic charge e
undergoing an acceleration a = dv/dt is given by the Larmor formula as follows:

(13)

So we see that only electrons with undergoing big acceleration can produce suﬃcient
power of radiation of photons. If we consider electrons in the system S′ with the drift
velocity v = vdrif t = cEy/H, then the equations of the trajectory are as follows:

x =

Big acceleration gives big radiation and also big tangential velocity for the given
intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld. However, big intensity of the magnetic ﬁeld reduces the
big circle to the small size.

If we describe the motion of electrons in planar magnetron in the SI system of units
(Jackson, 1998) and in the system S′, then, we write the following equations of motion:

Of course this is very small radiation, however this is only for one electron, or, in other
words for one elementary charge. If we prepare regime with many charges, say q = 1010e,
then the situation will be substantially diﬀerent. We obtain P = 1.75 W.

We can also easily determine the radius of circle in the system S′. The corresponding
formula in the SI system of units is given by equation (21): R = mEy/eB2, where B is
the magnetic induction. For B = 1T, we get:

R =

It follows from the last formula, that the radius of circle is very small and it means
that the external observer sees the radiating “straight line”, which is parallel with the
x-axis. Every point of this “straight line” radiates, however the enhancement of radiation
is only at the direction of “straight line”.

If we are interested also in the value of the drift velocity for our parameters of the

MAL, then we get:

vdrif t =

= 106 m s−1.

So we see, that we have chosen the parameters in a such way that the drift velocity is

substantially smaller than the velocity of light.

We see, that the current generated by the high-intensity ﬁeld with only one electron

at the arc of the cycloid is very small. However for e

1010e, we obtain J = 45 A

960 nm, B = 5T.

However, the synchrotron radiation is generated in the form of the all wavelength
and it means also for λ < λmax. It means that the planar magnetron generates also the
Roentgen radiation. Of course, the intensity of the Roentgen radiation of one electron
is very weak. However, in case with many electrons, it can be very strong and it diﬀers
from the laser radiation, which is produced in the optical frequencies. So, the practical
application of the planar magnetron as a source of the Roentgen, or, synchrotron radiation
is possible.

The planar magnetron is composed from the cathode and anode. If the cathode is
cold, then after application the voltage the emission of electrons occurs accidentally from
the arbitrary points of the cathode. In order to establish only one starting point of the
emission of electrons, we connect cathode with the prismatical, or conical protrusion with
the vertex between anode and cathode. Then, the electrons are sucked from the vertex
to the anode and move along the trajectory of the constant geometrical form. Then, the
planar magnetron as a source of synchrotron radiation works.

In case of the thermal cathode, the initial velocities of electrons are determined by the
statistical law. The consequence of it is, that many diﬀerent cycloids are generated and
the coherence of motion is broken.

4 The spectral function of the radiation of relativistic

electrons

Hitherto, we considered the nonrelativistic electrons. Now, we shall work with the
relativistic electrons for which it is elaborated the Schwinger formalism (source theory)
which enables to perform calculations in a simple and brilliant form. We shall derive
the power spectrum formula of the synchrotron radiation generated by the motion of an
electron moving in a planar magnetron. We follow Schwinger et al. (1976), but we will
follow also the author articles (Pardy, 1994, 1997).

Let us remark, that source theory methods (Schwinger, 1970, 1973; Dittrich, 1978)
was initially constructed for a description of high-energy particle physics experiments. It
was found that the original formulation simpliﬁes the calculations in electrodynamics and
gravity, where the interactions are mediated by the photon and graviton, respectively. It
simpliﬁes particularly the calculations with radiative corrections (Dittrich, 1978; Pardy,
1994) .

The basic formula of the Schwinger source theory is the so called vacuum to vacuum

5 Radiation of N electrons moving coherently in a

planar magnetron

We determine the power spectral formula in the system S′ moving with the drift velocity
vdrif t = cEy/H with regard to magnetron. In this case motion of electron is not cycloid
but the circle and we can repeat some formulae which were used in the previous work of
author (Pardy, 2000; 2002). Such approach is meaningful because we can return to the
system S using the formulas connecting frequencies and distribution in the system S with
frequencies and photon distribution in the system S′ (Landau et al., 1962).

We will apply the formula (40) to the N-body system with the same charged particles
which moves along the same circles with diameters R with the centres at points 0, 2R,
4R, ..., 2(N

1)R , where N is the natural number.

The general approach involves the consideration of parameters of medium and the
possibility of involving the ˇCerenkov electromagnetic radiation which is generated by
a fast-moving charged particle in a medium when its speed is faster than the speed
of light in this medium.
It seems that in our case of MAL this radiation represents
only the academical interest, nevertheless the future application cannot be excluded. So,
the connection with the experimental observation of this radiation by ˇCerenkov (1934)
and theoretical interpretation by Tamm and Frank (1937) in the framework of classical
electrodynamics is possible as the generalization of theory of MAL. A source theory
description by Schwinger et al. (1976) in the zero-temperature regime and the at the
ﬁnite-temperature regime by Pardy (1989, 1995) can be also considered as meaningful.

So we write for the charge density ̺ and for the current density J of the N-body

system:

the following transitions:

Now, we are prepared to write the power spectrum formula for emission of photons by
the planar magnetron with N electrons. We have all ingredients for determination of the
ﬁnal formula and we can follows the way of author article (Pardy, 2002). However, we see
that the last formula is very complicated and it means that the calculation of the power
spectrum will be not easy. So, in such a situation, we can use some approximation. One
possible approximation is to consider the contributions of terms with i = j. Then we get:

Formulas (55), (56) concerns the situation with electrons moving along the circular
trajectory.
In other words, we work in the system which moves with regard to the
magnetron at the drift velocity vdrif t.
In the case that we are in the system joined
with the magnetron, all wave lengths are shifted to the blue edge because of the Doppler
eﬀect. If we consider only photons moving along the x-axis, then, we can use the formula
for the Doppler shift of the following form (Rohlf, 1994):

6 The use of MAL at the therapy of cancer

We know from the medicine literature (Concise Medical Dictionary, 2003), that the cancer
is any malignant tumor, including carcinoma and sarcoma. It arises from the abnormal
and uncontrolled division of cells that then invade and destroy the surrounding tissues.
Cancer tumor is composed from cancer cells which we call metastases and which are
spread by blood stream in the lymphatic channels, thus setting up secondary tumors at
sites distant from the original tumor. There are many causative factors of cancer, such

as cigarette smoking, radiation, viruses and so on.
gene called p53 is deleted or impaired. Its normal function is to prevent the uncontrolled
division of cells. Treatment of cancer depends on the type of tumor, the site of the primary
tumor and the extend of spread.

We know, (Concise Medical Dictionary, 2003) that the usual methods of the cancer
therapy are chirurgical, biochemical and radiological. Radiotherapy, or, therapeutic
radiology is the treatment of desease with penetrating radiation, such as X-rays, beta
rays, gamma rays, proton beams, pion beams and so on. Specially, high energy protons
have ideal characteristics for treating deep-seated tumors (Jones et al., 2001). The rays are
usually produced by machines, or by the certain radioactive isotopes. Beams of radiation
may be directed at a deseased object from a distance of radioactive material. Well known
technique is Leksell gamma knife (Leksell, 1951). At present time it uses aproximatelly
200 sources of the gamma rays where gamma rays are produced by radionuclides 60Co.
Many forms of cancer are destroyed by this type of radiotherapy.

At present time the successful method is to treat cancer by the synchrotron radiation
generated by synchrotrons, betatrons and microtrons. We proposed in this article , the
planar magnetron laser, MAL, as the new medicine element for treating cancer. The size

11

of the planar megnetron is in no case so large as the synchrotron and it means the cancer
tumors can be negated ambulantly. So, the cancer therapy by MAL is hopeful.

7 Discussion

The generation of the synchrotron radiation by the planar magnetron, forms the analogue
of the wiggler and undulator generation of radiation (Winick, 1987). However, while
the wiggler and undulator radiators needs the high-energy electrons from additional
accelerator, the planar magnetron works with electrons which are accelerated by own
magnetic and electric ﬁelds. The acceleration depends on the intensity of electric ﬁeld,
and, the curvature of trajectory depends also on the magnetic ﬁeld. The spectrum of the
magnetron radiation in system S′ moving with the drift velocity vdrif t = cEy/H, is the
spectrum of the synchrotron radiation of N electrons moving along the circles of the same
radius. According to the special theory of relativity, there is only the magnetic ﬁeld in
the system S′. The MAL can work with the single electron on the trajectory, or, with
many electrons on one trajectory or many trajectories.
In case of many electrons the
radiation can be very intensive. The merit of the MAL is in small size with regard to
large synchrotrons. On the other hand the opening angle of radiation is not so small as in
the synchrotron because electrons in MAL are nonrelativistic. The small opening angle
is possible only for high energy electrons. According to Winick (1987), if an electron is
given a total energy 5 GeV, the opening angle over which synchrotron radiation is emitted
is only 0.0001 radian, or about 0.006 degree. This can be regarded as a beam with the
nearly parallel rays. This is practically the same as the laser beam situation. The wave
length of the magnetronic photons is from zero to inﬁnity. If we want to produce maximal
energy of photons at the very short length of photons, then we must apply in MAL very
high magnetic ﬁeld and very high voltage. If we use high-frequency high-voltage alternate
current generated by Tesla transformer, then we must also alternate the magnetic ﬁeld in
order to keep the motion of electrons in one direction. This can be easily realized, because
the x(t) is invariant with regard the simultaneous alternating the electric and magnetic
ﬁeld, as we can see:

The variable y is not invariant with regard to the transformation (58).

y(t). However, the prismatical protrusion causes that only trajectories with

the positive electric and magnetic ﬁelds are realized.

From formula (32) follows that MAL produces all wave lengths including synchrotron
radiation and visible light. Using optical ﬁlters we can leave only the short wave lengths.
Of course, then, the total applied radiation is decreased. In conclusion, we hope, that
MAL will play fundamental role in all branches of science.

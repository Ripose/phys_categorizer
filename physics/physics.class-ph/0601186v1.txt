A recent experiment by Antonini et. al.

[Phys. Rev. A 71, 050101R 2005], set new limits
on Lorentz violating parameters in the frame-work of the photon sector of the Standard Model
ZZ
e− , and the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl (RMS) framework, β − δ − 1/2. The
Extension (SME), ˜κ
experiment had signiﬁcant systematic eﬀects caused by the rotation of the apparatus which were
only partly analysed and taken into account. We show that this is insuﬃcient to put a bound on
˜κZZ
e− and the bound on β − δ − 1/2 represents a ﬁve-fold improvement not a ten-fold improvement
as claimed.

Non-rotating experiments that test Lorentz Invariance
are not sensitive to the SME parameter ˜κZZ
e− [1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6]. To determine this parameter one requires ac-
tive rotation with a non-zero signal expected to occur
at twice the rotation frequency, 2ωR [7, 8, 9]. Thus, it
is important to control and minimize systematic signals
at this harmonic.
If systematics dominate over statis-
tical uncertainties, care must be taken when analyzing
the data as it is diﬃcult to distinguish the systematic
signal from an actual non-zero value of ˜κZZ
e− . One way
to do this is to characterize the systematic and subtract
it from the data, which can be a diﬃcult process as the
amplitude may not necessarily be stationary over the pe-
riod of data collection. Nevertheless, if one is careful
[7] did eﬀec-
it is a valid process and Antonini et. al.
tively account for part of the unknown systematics in
their experiment by subtracting the frequency modula-
tion of the resonators induced by tilt. However, they
were still left with a statistically signiﬁcant amplitude at
2ωR which lead to a positive signal for Lorentz violation
e− = (−2.0 ± 0.2 × 10−14). They state that this
of ˜κZZ
is likely due to a (non-accounted) systematic eﬀect and
thus claim an upper bound of |˜κZZ

e− | < 2 × 10−14.

Since the suspected systematic is uncharacterized there
is no way to know if the measured amplitude is due to a
systematic or a true non-zero value of ˜κZZ
e− . Furthermore,
one can not rule out that the uncharacterized systematic
is actually canceling (partly or completely, depending on
its phase) a larger non-zero value of ˜κZZ
e− , so one can
not set a valid upper limit simply equal to the measured
value. One way to set a bound amongst the systematic
is to include more than one independent set of data, (i.e.
n > 1 where n is the number of data sets). A bound can
then be set by treating the amplitude of ˜κZZ
e− as a statis-
tic. This is possible because the phase of the systematic
depends on the initial experimental conditions (i.e. phase
with respect to the frame of reference of the test), and is
likely to be random across the n data sets [8, 9]. If we

take the mean of the n ˜κZZ
e− amplitudes, the systematic
signal will cancel if the phase is random, but the possible
Lorentz violating signal will not. Thus a limit can be set
by taking the mean and standard deviation of the ampli-
tude over the n data sets. Therefore, unless more than
one data set is analyzed a bound on the value of ˜κZZ
e− can
not be given in the presence of an unknown systematic.
Since Antonini et. al.
[7] only gave statistics for one
data set of 76 hours duration (n = 1), it is not possible
to quote a bound on ˜κZZ
e− from the analysis of this data.
In our recent rotating experiment we determined a
e− of 4.1(0.5) × 10−15 by ﬁtting the ampli-
value of ˜κZZ
tude over 5 data sets [8, 9]. However, we did not use
this result to claim an upper limit on the value of ˜κZZ
e− .
Instead we followed the approach suggested above and
took the mean and standard deviation of the amplitudes
obtained from the individual data sets. This allowed us
e− = 2.1(5.7) × 10−14, the uncertainty be-
to determine ˜κZZ
ing dominated by the variation of the systematic over the
data sets.

Antonini et. al. also claim a ten-fold improvement in
the RMS [10, 11] parameter β − δ − 1/2 [7], which is
determined to be (+0.5 ± 3 ± 0.7) × 10−10, in comparison
to the previous best result of (−2.2 ± 1.5) × 10−9 [2].
Comparing the uncertainties this is no more than a factor
of 5 improvement and has been overstated by a factor
of 2. Our recent concurrent work obtained a value of
(+0.9 ± 2) × 10−10, which is a factor of 7.5 improvement
[8].

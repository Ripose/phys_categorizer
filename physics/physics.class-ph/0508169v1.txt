Abstract

It is proved that within the framework of Special Relativity, a force
B,

exerted on a classical particle by a ﬁeld must be of the form E+v
the Lorentz force form.

1 Introduction

The principle of least action is a well established method of writing special-
relativistic physical theories [1, 2].
In this article we shall use the action
principle along with special relativity in order to prove one of the most im-
portant formulae in physics: the Lorentz force on a particle in an electro-
magnetic ﬁeld.

The Lorentz force formula is very well known [3, 1, 2], but a theoretical
derivation of it is lacking. Landau and Lifshitz [2, page 44] have stated that
the formula is considered to be at least in part, an empirical one. Partial
proofs exist, for example assuming the electrical force in the rest frame,
assuming the transformation law for the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and deducing
the magnetic part of the force [4].

We shall make no such assumptions, and in fact we will prove something
stronger than the mathematical form of the force. It will be proved that the
Lorentz force is the only force possible in a classical special-relativistic theory
of particles and ﬁelds.

As a by-product, it follows immediately that in the conditions just stated,

the force has the well known U(1) gauge symmetry [3].

It is important to emphasise that our proof concerns only the force on
the particles, that is, the manner in which the ﬁelds determine the motion

1

of a particle. It does not concern the opposite dynamics of how the particles
inﬂuence the ﬁelds (in electrodynamics, the Maxwell equations describe this
part of the physics.)

In order to make the article self contained, a brief review of the formulae
for the action of free particles will be given in section 2. The proof itself is
presented in sections 3 and 4. All throughout this work we will make use of
natural units, i.e. c = 1, where c denotes the speed of light in vacuum, and
use the four-vector notation of Bjorken and Drell [5].

2 Action Principle

We deal here with classical, special-relativistic mechanics.
It is important
to state that our discussion is limited to elementary particles, in the sense
expressed by Landau and Lifshitz [2]. A particle’s degrees of freedom are its
position in space x. Its velocity is v = ˙x. Its path in space is a function x(t).
We may represent it as four functions xµ(τ ), τ being the particle’s proper
time, deﬁned by

The action, S, is a time integral of some Lagrange function L(xi, ˙xi) of

the coordinates and their velocities.

Z
We may cast S in the form of an integral over the proper time of the particle,

dτ 2 = dxµdxµ.

S =

The action may be written in a manifestly Lorentz-invariant form, which
also emphasises its dependence on the particle’s trajectory, if we deﬁne a
scalar parameter q, to parametrise the particle’s path instead of τ :

The equation of motion is the Euler-Lagrange equation, and it eventually
leads to:

d2xµ
dτ 2 = 0.
This is the, quite trivial, equation of motion for a free particle. The parti-
cle’s four-momentum pµ is, for a free particle, identical with its canonically
conjugate momentum:

The equation of motion of a free particle may thus also be written

3 A Particle In a Scalar Potential Field

We wish now generalise the problem to something more than a free particle.
In Newtonian mechanics the next step is a particle acted on by some force,
which is derived from a potential ﬁeld. Thus we try to add a “potential” to
function given

. Let us ask what is the dynamics of a particle with an

ψ(x),

where ψ(x) is the interaction term of the particle with an external ﬁeld. The

Now q is some scalar parameter. Supposing that we have solved the
equation of motion, eq. (13), and obtained a solution xµ(q), we may determine
the connection between q and the proper time τ by integrating the relation

The last equation may be easily obtained from eq. (1). We may note that it
is consistent to choose q = τ , with an initial condition τ (q0) = q0. But since
q = τ is a solution of the diﬀerential equation eq. (14), then it must be the
solution. The equations of motion may thus be written as:

We may gain further insight to the dynamics of the particle by noting that
dτ , and thus pµpµ = m2 is a constant of motion.

by its deﬁnition, pµ = m dxµ
Diﬀerentiating we may deduce:

(pµpµ) = 2pµ

Using eq. (15) and denoting p = (E, p), we get

path,

along the particle’s path.

(19)

Apparently, a particle moving under the inﬂuence of some prescribed
ﬁeld ψ(x), moves on space-time contours of constant ψ. The change in ψ
arising from the motion of the particle in space, is conpensated exactly by
the particle’s motion in time.

This places a severe constraint on the allowed ﬁelds ψ. So severe is this
constraint, that it is in fact too much to ask for from a scalar ﬁeld that

4

depends only on the coordinates. Equation (18) is a constraint not only on
the ﬁeld, but on the initial conditions. Let us take our initial conditions at
x = 0. Eq.
(18) gives us a condition on the velocity component parallel to
∇ψ, vn:

(20)

Thus, given an arbitrary external ﬁeld ψ, we are not completely free to choose
the initial conditions1.
In the nonrelativistic limit, where Newtonian me-
chanics holds, eq. (20) demands that we have no velocity component in the
direction of ∇ψ. This is in contradiction with observed fact, as well as with
our intuition that the initial velocity of a particle may be in any direction.

We therefore conclude that in a classical theory of particles and ﬁelds, it
is impossible to have a particle coupled to a scalar ﬁeld which is a function
only of the particle’s coordinates xµ.

4 Proof of the theorem: special relativity in-

duces the Lorentz force

Our ﬁrst attempt at generalisation of the free particle Lagrangian in section
3 has failed. We see that we must try something more complicated. From
the nonrelativistic limit, we know that the the equations of motion must be
second order in time—mathematicaly, this ensures that the initial conditions
of the particle, its position x and its velocity v at some initial time, are
suﬃcient to determine its motion. We may try to introduce an interaction
that depends on the particle’s velocity, uµ = dxµ/dτ , but not on higher
derivatives, as that would lead to equations of motion that are of higher
than second order in time. Thus, adding such an interaction,

Let us now demand that pµpµ will be a constant of motion, as it should be.
We have seen that this is tantamount to:

Let us therefore contract eq. (23) with pµ and equate the result to zero:

We thus obtain a limitation on the interactions ψ that will be consistent with
special relativity. But in contrast to section 3, there are interactions that
can live up to our criteria, and still be physically sensible. We require that

where C is a constant, which obviously cannot inﬂuence the equations of
motion, and thus may be chosen to vanish. Having chosen C = 0, we see
that an interaction ψ(xµ, uµ) that can satisfy eq. (30) must be linear in uµ

ψ(xµ, uµ) = Aµ(x)uµ,
where Aµ(x) is a vector ﬁeld that depends on space and time, but not on the
particle’s velocity. The equation of motion, eq. (23) yields:

To recapitulate, we have proved that classical special-relativistic particles

may only be acted on by a force which has the Lorentz force form.

5 Discussion

The theorem just proved may cause one to wonder whether it is in contra-
diction with the known fact that there are non Lorentz-like forces in Nature.
In fact there is no contradiction. The nuclear interactions are in essence a
quantum mechanical phenomena, and thus out of the scope of the theorem.
Gravitation, best described by the theory of General Relativity, is also out
of its scope, because the metric becomes a dynamical variable. The remain-
ing force, electromagnetism, is within the theorem’s scope, and indeed, it is
known to obey it.

Since non Lorentz forces exist in nature, of which gravity is the most easily
observable example, and owing to the fact that they cannot be consistent with
special relativity, we may quite trivially state an interesting consequence: a
world with non Lorentz-form forces can not be described solely by special
relativity.

Indeed, we know this from the physics of the twentieth century: quantum

mechanics and general relativity.

The equation of motion, eq. (35), is invariant under the gauge transfor-

mation,

2This is the force for a particle of unit charge. Here we have absorbed the coupling

Aµ(x) + ∂µχ(x).

Aµ(x)

strength into the ﬁeld, so the charge does not appear explicitly

7

This is a well known fact for electrodynamics, but we may now state it as an
inevitable consequence of special relativity. This may be a clue that gauge
symmetries are connected with the physics of the spacetime.

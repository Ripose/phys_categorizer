Superconducting pipes and levitating magnets

Motivated by a beautiful demonstration of the Faraday’s and Lenz’s law in which a small
neodymium magnet falls slowly through a conducting non-ferromagnetic tube, we consider the
dynamics of a magnet falling through a superconducting pipe. Unlike the case of normal conducting
pipes, in which the magnet quickly reaches the terminal velocity, inside a superconducting tube the
magnet falls freely. On the other hand, to enter the pipe the magnet must overcome a large elec-
tromagnetic energy barrier. For suﬃciently strong magnets, the barrier is so large that the magnet
will not be able to penetrate it and will be suspended over the front edge. We calculate the work
that must done to force the magnet to enter a superconducting tube. The calculations show that
superconducting pipes are very eﬃcient at screening magnetic ﬁelds. For example, the magnetic ﬁeld
of a dipole at the center of a short pipe of radius a and length L ≈ a decays, in the axial direction,
with a characteristic length ξ ≈ 0.26a. The eﬃcient screening of the magnetic ﬁeld might be useful
for shielding highly sensitive superconducting quantum interference devices, SQUIDs. Finally, the
motion of the magnet through a superconducting pipe is compared and contrasted to the ﬂow of
ions through a trans-membrane channel.

I.

INTRODUCTION

There is a beautiful demonstration of Faraday’s and
Lenz’s laws which became very popular as a result of
an easy availability of powerful rare earth magnets [1, 9].
The demonstration consists of a long pipe made of a con-
ducting, non-ferromagnetic material, such as copper or
aluminum, and a neodymium magnet which is allowed
to fall through it. One ﬁnds that the magnet takes a
very long time to traverse the pipe. In fact for a tube
of about 2m in length, the magnet takes almost 25s to
ﬁnish the trip [9]! On the other hand, a non-magnetic
object of the same dimensions falls through the pipe in
less than 1s. It is quite amazing to observe the falling
magnet from the top aperture, the magnet appears to
be moving through a very dense ﬂuid. In reality, air pro-
vides only a negligible resistance, and what actually slows
the magnet is the force produced by the eddy currents
induced in the pipe. This force is proportional to the
velocity of the falling magnet. When the drag force be-
comes equal to the magnet’s weight, acceleration ceases
and the fall continues at a constant terminal velocity.
For strong rare earth magnets, the terminal velocity is
reached very quickly. Perhaps surprisingly, in view of
the complexity of the problem, it is actually possible to
perform a fairly simple calculation which agrees quanti-
tatively with the terminal velocity observed experimen-
tally [9]. Curiously, the calculation also predicts that the
terminal velocity should be proportional to the electrical
resistivity of the pipe’s material. This suggests that if the
pipe is an ideal superconductor, the velocity of the falling

∗levin@if.ufrgs.br
†rizzato@if.ufrgs.br

magnet should vanish. One can easily see, however, that
this conclusion can not be right. Suppose that a magnetic
dipole is created inside an inﬁnite superconducting pipe.
During the process of creation, the magnetic ﬁeld inside
the pipe is changing and the electric current is induced
on its surface. The surface currents screen the magnet’s
ﬁeld and prevent it from entering into the interior of the
superconductor.
In the case of an ideal superconduc-
tor (inertialess electrons) considered in the bulk of this
paper, the penetration length is zero and both the mag-
netic and the electric ﬁelds are perfectly screened. By
symmetry it is also clear that for an inﬁnitely long pipe,
the magnetic ﬁeld produced by the induced currents is
maximum precisely at the location of the magnet. Since
the magnetic force on a dipole is proportional to the gra-
dient of the ﬁeld it must, therefore, vanish so that the
magnet will fall without any resistance. The theory of
reference [9] is not applicable to the perfect conductors
because it was explicitly constructed to treat normal met-
als for which the magnetic permeability is very close to
that of vacuum. Furthermore, the rate of decay of the
induced currents in such metals is very fast, compared to
the magnet fall velocity, allowing us to neglect the eﬀects
of self-induction [9]. Clearly, neither one of these condi-
tions is met in the case of super or ideal conductors which
dynamically screen magnetic ﬁeld from their interior. As
the resistivity of the pipe metal is decreased, there will
be a crossover from the terminal velocity found in ref. [9]
for normal pipes to the free fall velocity inside perfectly
conducting pipes.

Although a magnet “created” in the interior of an inﬁ-
nite superconducting pipe will fall freely under the action
of the gravitational ﬁeld, it takes work to bring (create)
the magnet inside the pipe in the ﬁrst place. This is so
because the magnetic ﬁeld lines, which for a free dipole
spread throughout the space, must now be conﬁned in

a much more restricted volume.
In this paper we will
calculate the work that must be done to bring a mag-
net into superconducting pipe of length L and radius a.
Furthermore, the formalism developed here can be easily
extended to study more general problems of screening of
the magnetic ﬁeld in cylindrical geometry [3, 4], which
are of particular interest for the development of reliable
SQUID devices [5].

II. THE MODEL

The model that we shall study is depicted in Fig. 1.
A magnetic dipole, of moment m = mˆz, is brought from
inﬁnity and is inserted into cylindrical superconducting
pipe of length L and radius a along the symmetry axis.
This axis is taken to coincide with the z axis of the coor-
dinate system. The radius of the pipe is assumed to be
much larger than the wall thickness and will, therefore,
be ignored. The Faraday’s law of induction requires that

dΦ(z, t)
dt

= −

E · dr,

I

where Φ(z, t) is the magnetic ﬂux passing through a cross
section of the pipe at position z and time t, and E is
the local electric ﬁeld. Since the tangential component
of the electric ﬁeld is continuous across the supercon-
ductor/air interface, the right hand side of Eq. (1) must
vanish because no electric ﬁeld can be present inside a
perfect conductor. Thus, the ﬂux passing through any
cross section of the pipe must be constant in time. Fur-
thermore, when the magnet is at inﬁnity, the ﬂux entering
the pipe is zero, which then means that Φ(z, t) = 0 at
all future times as well. Vanishing ﬂux is a direct conse-
quence of the physics of cylindrical superconductors and
must be used as a boundary condition for the solution
of the Maxwell’s equations. In Fig. 1 we have made an
attempt to represent the magnetic ﬁeld lines which are
not allowed to go through the pipe because of the restric-
tion on ﬂux. Again we stress that this behavior is very
diﬀerent from what happens with normal metals [9] for
which the electric ﬁeld does not vanish and magnetic ﬂux
changes through diﬀerent cross sections of the pipe.

Inside the superconductor, magnetic ﬁeld is zero and
the continuity of the normal component of B requires
that the normal component of the external ﬁeld also van-
ishes at the superconducting wall. The magnetic ﬁeld
lines must, therefore, be tangent to the pipe’s surface. In
general, however, vanishing of Bn at the interface is not
suﬃcient to fully specify the boundary condition neces-
sary for the existence of a unique solution to Maxwell
equations.

III. UNIQUENESS

What are the boundary conditions which will make the

ﬁeld equation

(1)

∇ × B = µ0J

(2)

have a unique solution? Suppose that Eq. (2) allows for
two distinct solutions B1 and B2 for the same value of
the current density J. Since ∇ · B = 0, we can always
deﬁne a vector potential A such that B1,2 = ∇ × A1,2.
Now, consider the integral over all space

δB · δB d3r =

∇ × δA · ∇ × δA d3r,

(3)

Z

Z

where δB ≡ B2 − B1 and δA ≡ A2 − A1 The integrand
on the right-hand-side can be cast into more convenient
form using the identity (∇×δA)2 ≡ δA·∇×∇×δA+∇·
(δA×∇×δA). Recalling that the current sources for the
ﬁelds 1 and 2 are identical: 0 = µ0(J2 − J1) ≡ µ0 δJ =
∇×δB = ∇×∇×δA, the integrand of Eq. (3) reduces to
a perfect divergence. Using the divergence theorem, the
volume integral can now be transformed into an integral
over the bounding surfaces S, which in our case are the
cylinder and the spherical shell of radius R = ∞.

δB2 d3r =

da ˆn · (δA × ∇ × δA).

(4)

Z

ZS

Since the dipolar ﬁeld decreases rapidly with distance,
the contribution to the integral in Eq. (4) coming from
the spherical shell at R = ∞ vanishes, and S reduces to
the surface of the cylinder. Using the cyclical invariance
of the integrand, we see that Eq. (2) has a unique solution
(δB(r) ≡ 0) either if ˆn × δA = 0 or ˆn × δB = 0, on the
pipe surface. To have a well posed problem it is, there-
fore, not suﬃcient to specify only the normal component
of the magnetic ﬁeld, instead the tangential components

of the ﬁeld at the interface must be provided. In a cylin-
drical geometry the boundary conditions posed in terms
of the vector potential are particularly useful. Azimuthal
symmetry around the z axis, restricts the vector potential
to have only one non zero component in the eφ direction,
A = Aφ ˆeφ(r, z). The ﬂux through a cross section of the
pipe is then

Φ(z) =

B·ˆnda =

∇×A·ˆnda =

A· dr = 2πa Aφ(a, z).

(5)
Speciﬁcation of the ﬂux passing through the pipe is,
therefore, equivalent to the speciﬁcation of Aφ and guar-
antees that Eq. (2) has a unique solution in the cylindrical
geometry.

IV. A PIPE OF INFINITE LENGTH

For superconducting pipes of L = ∞, Eq. (2) can be
solved analytically, while for ﬁnite L only numerical so-
lution is possible. We start, therefore, with the L = ∞
case.

The dipole of moment m = mˆz is located inside the

pipe’s interior there are no free currents and the Am-
pere’s law, Eq. (2), reduces to ∇ × B = 0 outside the
magnet. The magnetic ﬁeld can then be written as a
gradient of a scalar function B = −∇ϕ. This deﬁnes
the scalar magnetic potential ϕ, which also satisﬁes the
Laplace equation since ∇·B = 0. The magnetic potential
ϕ ≡ ϕd + ϕind is produced by the point dipole,

3

for r < a. We next note that ϕind must be odd in z,
free of singularities, and must vanish as z → ∞. Under
these conditions, the solution of the Laplace equation (7)
can be written in terms of a Fourier integral involving
modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind,

ϕind(r, z) =

A(k)Io(kr) sin(kz)dk.

According to the results of the previous section, the func-
tion A(k) will be uniquely determined by the condition
that Φ(z) = 0, which means that no magnetic ﬁeld lines
are lost to the wall. For inﬁnite superconducting pipe
this boundary condition, is, therefore, equivalent to the
vanishing of the normal component of the magnetic ﬁeld
Bn(a, z) = 0 on the wall. This means that the normal
component of the induced ﬁeld must cancel exactly the
ﬁeld produced by the dipole,

The condition that the magnetic ﬁeld lines must exit
the pipe on the same side on which they entered (Φ(z) =
0),
implies that the magnet can not “probe” the full
length of the pipe. Thus, if the pipe length is such that
L > a, its ﬁeld screening properties should be identical
to those of a pipe of L = ∞. With this observation in
mind we are now ready to study superconducting pipes
of ﬁnite length.

V. PIPES OF FINITE LENGTHS

Consider a superconducting pipe of ﬁnite length L
placed along the z axis, whose center coincides with the
origin at z = 0. Results of the previous sections sug-
gests that if L > a, shortly after the dipole ﬁnds itself
inside the tube, the magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration should
be identical to that inside an inﬁnite pipe and the axial
force should vanish. However, little can be said about
what kind of forces act upon the dipole as it enters or
exits the pipe. Finite length case should, therefore, be
examined with some care.

From sections §2 and §3 we recall that the magnetic
ﬂux at any cross section of a superconducting pipe must
vanish. This information will be central to the practical
aspects of the theory from now on. As the dipole ap-
proaches the pipe from z → +∞, surface currents are

imagine that the length of the pipe is subdivided into
uniform rings, each carrying a circulating surface current
density j(z). The vector potential produced by these cur-
rents has only φ component and its magnitude is given
by the linear superposition,

Aind(r, z) =

K(r, z, z′)j(z′)dz′,

where zm is the coordinate of dipole. To determine j(z),
Eq. (20) is solved numerically by ﬁrst discretizing the
integral and then performing a matrix inversion. Once
the current distribution is known, the vector potential
Aind is calculated using Eq. (17). Knowing Aind, the
induced magnetic ﬁeld on the axis of symmetry r = 0,
Bind = ˆz/r ∂r(rAind)|r=0 and the magnetic force on the
dipole F = ˆz∂z(m · Bind)|z=zm,r=0 can be easily eval-
uated. We note that forces arising from ﬂux trapping
in type-II superconductors are neglected in the present
discussion. For this to be a good approximation, the
superconductor must have either high critical state cur-
rent density Jc or be subjected to only small magnetic
ﬁeld [6, 7, 8]. We will discuss this more in conclusions.

A. Checking the accuracy of the numerical
procedure

The accuracy of the numerical procedure used to solve
the integral equation Eq. (20) can be judged by compar-
ing it with the analytical solution for an inﬁnite pipe,
Eq. (12). In Fig. 2 we compare Bind along the axis of
symmetry for an inﬁnitely long pipe with the ﬁeld cal-
culated using a numerical integration of Eq. (20) for a
pipe of L = 10a with a dipole located at zm = 0. The
agreement is perfect and attests to the reliability of the
numerical solution. Furthermore, since the axial mag-
netic ﬁeld is maximum at the position of the dipole, the
force on it will vanish, in agreement with our previous
discussion.

In Fig. 2 we also show that asymptotically the mag-
netic ﬁeld is well approximated by Eq. (14). Thus, in
agreement with the previous discussion, the axial mag-
netic ﬁeld is screened exponentially even for pipes of ﬁnite
length, as long as L > a.

lengths

[2]. The ﬂux generated by the surface currents at z is

Satisﬁed with the accuracy of the numerical procedure,
we can now use it to study the edge eﬀects associated
with the ﬁnite length superconducting pipes. In Fig. 3
we plot the magnetic force felt by a magnet as it moves

The analytical result is for L = ∞, while the numerical solu-
tion is for L = 10a. Nevertheless, there is a perfect agreement
between the two. We also compare the analytical asymptotic
form (dotted line) Eq. (14) of the axial magnetic ﬁeld, with
the result of numerical integration (squares) for L = 10a,

side a ﬁnite superconducting pipe.

from inﬁnity into the interior of a superconducting pipe
of length L = 10a. Panel (a) shows a strong repulsive
force near the pipe entrance which vanishes rapidly as
the magnet penetrates into the pipe. In the case of small
neodymium magnets (weight 6g) used in our demonstra-
tions of the Faraday’s and Lenz’s laws [9] and a supercon-
ducting pipe of radius a = 7.85 mm we ﬁnd the repulsive
force to be suﬃcient to support a weight of 1 kg! In panel
(b) we plot the work necessary to bring a magnet from
inﬁnity to a point z. Clearly, there is a large electromag-
netic energy barrier that the magnet must overcome to
enter the pipe. Note that soon after the magnet crosses
the front edge into the interior of the tube, the poten-
tial stabilizes at a plateau the value of which is in per-
fect agreement with the work found to be necessary to
conﬁne a dipole inside an inﬁnite superconducting tube,
Eq. (16). This agreement is, again, a consequence of a
very eﬃcient exponential screening of the magnetic ﬁeld
by the surface currents, even inside pipes of ﬁnite length.

As the magnet approaches a superconducting tube, it
experiences a magnetic force which opposes its motion.
The magnitude of this force can be estimated using a
simple scaling argument. Magnetic ﬁeld produced by a
dipole decays with distance as Bmagnet ∼ m/s3. If the
superconducting pipe is suﬃciently narrow (L ≫ a) and
the magnet is not too close to the front edge, the mutual-
inductance eﬀects between the sections of the pipe can
be neglected and the induced surface current density at
distance s from the magnet will be j(s) ∼ Bmagnet ∼
m/s3. On the other hand, each one of these current
loops will produce a magnetic ﬁeld at the position of the
dipole, dBpipe→magnet ∼ j(s) ds/s3 ∼ m ds/s6, and will

dition, the magnetic ﬁeld varies only slightly over the

Comparing Eqs. (24) and (22) we ﬁnd the polarizability

In Fig. 4(a) we compare the asymptotic force calcu-
lated using the numerical solution of the integral equation
(20) with the estimate obtained using Eq. (21) for a tube
of L = 10a. The agreement is very good for zm ≫ L, but
poorer for smaller values of the coordinate. The problem
is that L = 10a is not suﬃciently large to well satisfy
the inequality a ≪ zm ≪ L, as demanded by the ﬁrst
asymptotic region of (22). For larger values of L, such as
L = 20 of Fig. 4(b), the agreement already is much bet-
ter. The abrupt decay of F s6
d near the entrance of the
tube is a consequence of the ﬁnite cross section of the
pipe, which becomes important for small values of sd.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

We have examined the forces and the ﬁelds produced
by a small magnet as it enters into a superconducting
pipe. For an inﬁnitely long pipe, magnetic ﬁeld produced

6

by a magnet inside a tube is exponentially screened by
the surface currents.

In the case of ﬁnite superconducting pipes we ﬁnd that
the magnetic ﬁeld is also exponentially screened, as long
as the length of the pipe is larger than its diameter. The
exponential screening of the magnetic ﬁeld is a conse-
quence of the Faraday’s law which leads to vanishing of
the magnetic ﬂux inside a superconducting pipe. The ﬂux
lines can not go through the pipe and at any cross section
the number of lines going down is the same as the number
of lines coming up. The electromagnetic cost of conﬁning
a dipole inside a superconducting tube is, therefore, very
large, since the ﬁeld lines must be strongly compressed
to ﬁt inside the pipe. We calculate that in order to insert
a small neodymium magnet of 6g into a superconducting
pipe of radius 8mm requires 10N of force. Once the mag-
net is inside the pipe, however, its motion will continue
unhindered. At the exit, the magnet will be ejected with
the same force that was required to insert it into the pipe
in the ﬁrst place.

It is curious to compare the magnet’s motion through
a superconducting pipe, with the ﬂow of ions through an
ion channel [11]. Ion channels are water ﬁlled holes, re-
sponsible for a small potential gradient that exists across
all biological membranes. Since the dielectric constant
inside a pore is much larger than the dielectric constant
of a phospholipid membrane, the normal component of
the electric ﬁeld at the channel/membrane interface is
very small and the electric ﬁeld lines are mostly conﬁned
to stay in the pore’s interior. In this respect, the pore
is very similar to a superconducting pipe, for which the
normal component of the magnetic ﬁeld also vanishes on
the boundary. Nevertheless, one ﬁnds that contrary to
what happens to a magnet inside a superconductor, the
repulsive force on an ion does not vanish even when it
is far inside the channel. Ions always feel a force which
tries to expel them from the channel (except exactly at
midpoint where, by symmetry, the force vanishes).

The diﬀerence between superconducting pipes and ion
channels is precisely due to the additional constraint of
vanishing ﬂux imposed by the Faraday’s law on a per-
fect conductor. The requirement that the ﬂux through
any cross section of a superconducting pipe must vanish,
forces the system to be in a metastable state. If this con-
dition is relaxed, energy of the magnet/superconductor
system can be lowered. For example, suppose that the
magnet is placed inside a normal conductor and only
later the temperature is lowered until the superconduct-
ing state is achieved. In this case the magnetic ﬁeld con-
ﬁguration inside the pipe will be diﬀerent from the one
when the magnet is placed into an already superconduct-
ing pipe. There will no longer be a restriction that the
ﬂux must vanish and, in fact, the magnetic ﬁeld lines at
the moment that the pipe turns superconducting will be
partially expelled, leaving behind a ﬁnite ﬂux. The en-
ergy cost of conﬁning a magnet under these conditions
will, therefore, be signiﬁcantly lower. Inside an ion chan-
nel, behavior of the electric ﬁeld is very similar to the

7

case of a superconductor without a vanishing ﬂux con-
straint. It is precisely this constraint that is responsible
for the exponential screening of the magnetic ﬁeld found
for superconducting pipes of even ﬁnite length.
If the
vanishing ﬂux constraint is relaxed (by say the process
of turning the pipe superconducting after the magnet is
placed inside), the magnetic ﬁeld will no longer be ex-
ponentially screened inside a ﬁnite pipe, and the magnet
would encounter a repulsive barrier, similar to the one
faced by an ion inside a trans-membrane channel, and a
non-vanishing magnetic force [11]

In this work we have neglected the hysterectic ( ﬂux
trapping) forces typically present in type-II superconduc-
tors. For small cylindrical neodymium magnets weighing
6g and radius r = 6.35 mm moving through a supercon-
ducting pipe of a ∼ 8 mm, the magnetic ﬁeld at the pipe

surface is on the order of B ∼ 0.1 T . Considering a strong
pinning condition with a high critical state current den-
sity Jc ∼ 108A/m2, we estimate [6, 7, 10] the drag force
on the magnet to be only a small fraction ∼ 0.0001 of the
force required to enter the superconducting pipe. Thus,
our results should not be much aﬀected even if more re-
alistic type II superconductors are used.

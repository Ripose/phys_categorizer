ELASTOPLASTIC EQUATIONS WITH EXACT
CONSISTENCY OF STRAINS FOR THE ELASTIC
STRAIN FRAME AND THE VELOCITIES OF
POINTS

I.A.Solomeshch, M.A.Solomeshch

Abstract

We obtain an exact strain consistency equation for full, elastic and
plastic strain characteristics that have a clear physical meaning and are
naturally related to stresses. The dynamic equations are represented in a
form that does not use the objective stress rate. This obviates a number
of essential diﬃculties in the theory of ﬁnite elastoplastic strains.

1 Introduction

The present paper gives a detailed justiﬁcation of the results obtained in [1]. To
characterize them, let us very roughly outline the main diﬃculties encountered
in mathematical elastoplasticity when passing from inﬁnitesimal to ﬁnite strains
and the methods used so far to overcome these diﬃculties. A detailed analysis
can be found in the critical survey [2] of the state of the art in the theory by
1990 and in the monograph [3], which summarizes what has been done in the
last ﬁfty years.

Since the above-mentioned diﬃculties already arise when dealing with ho-
mogeneous isotropic elastic–perfectly plastic materials, we momentarily restrict
ourselves to such materials.

In the Eulerian variables, elastoplastic deformation processes are described
in terms of mass point velocities, material density, selected measures (charac-
teristics) of full, elastic, and plastic strains, and stresses. With the advent in
1930 of the Prandtl–Reuß equation (see [4]), the closed system of elastoplastic-
ity equations for inﬁnitesimal strains was obtained. We single out the following
three of these equations (the remaining three equations remain unchanged under
the transition to ﬁnite strains):

A. The strain consistency equation (a tensor equation) relates full, elastic,

and plastic strain characteristics.

an elastic strain characteristic.

B. The stress response function (a tensor equation) expresses the stress via

C. The ﬂow law (a tensor equation) relates the plastic strain to the stresses.
Under the transition to ﬁnite strains, the strain consistency equation (A) is
not true in general ([3], 7.2) and the system is no longer closed. Moreover, not
only measures but also the very notions of elastic and plastic strain have no
precise physical meaning, and there is controversy (as yet unsettled) as to how
exactly they should be introduced ([2], 4A).

In this connection, there has been quite a few general theories (some of which
are presented in [5–11]), a fact that alone shows how unsatisfactory the situation
is. All these theories can be divided into four groups.

1. Elastic strain is not considered at all. The plastic strain is introduced by
a constitutive equation of type (C) via a measure that does not have a precise
physical meaning. Two variables (plastic and full strain) are introduced in the
constitutive equation (B) instead of elastic strain, and the system again becomes
closed (e.g., see [5]).

D. The fact that the strain measure is artiﬁcial casts doubt on the existence
(and all the more, the simplicity) of the constitutive equations (B) and/or (C).
2. The plastic strain is not considered, and so equation (C) disappears.
Instead of (A), using various analogies, one introduces a constitutive diﬀerential
equation for the elastic strain, which closes the system. It is this new equation
that is doubtful (e.g., see [6, 7]).

3. Both elastic and plastic strains are introduced. One of them is determined

via the other (using the full strain) but has no precise physical meaning.

In this case, the very deﬁnition already gives the strain consistency equation
instead of (A). The system remains closed but has the drawback described above
in (D) (e.g., see [8, 9]).

4. For the strain consistency equation (A), one uses the multiplicative de-
composition of the full strain gradient in terms of the elastic and plastic strain
gradients or the related additive decomposition of the full strain rate in the
elastic and plastic strain rates [10].

Serious objections to the ﬁrst relation can be found in [2], 4A. The second
relation is not true in general and involves the objective stress rate, resulting in
heavy inconsistencies ([2], 4F; [3], 7.2, 7.3).

In the present paper, elastic strain is characterized by the elastic strain frame
ˇa, which is more informative than the Cauchy–Lagrange tensor. In the deformed
medium, the elastic strain frame ﬁeld generates the Riemannian metric of the
“natural, unstressed state.” Under suﬃciently wide assumptions, this metric
permits one to judge about the natural measure of deformed material objects
(i.e., the measure that they would have after unloading), without resorting to
actual unloading.

We introduce the plastic strain tensor, which has the same physical meaning
in terms of the natural measure as does the elastic strain tensor for elastic media
in terms of the geometric measure.

2

We obtain the strain consistency equation in frame form, providing an exact

relationship between the full, elastic, and plastic strain characteristics.

We introduce the relative stress tensor (with respect to the Riemannian
metric generated by an arbitrary nondegenerate frame ﬁeld), whose restrictions
are the natural stress tensor and the conventional Cauchy stress tensor and
Piola–Kirchhoﬀ second stress tensor.

For media homogeneous and isotropic in the natural state, we suggest a
plastic constitutive law speciﬁed by a scalar function p of the principal stresses
and possibly by parameters determined by the strain history. The presence or
absence of yield surfaces is determined by the properties of p.

Under the assumptions accepted in the paper, we obtain a system of quasi-
linear ﬁrst-order partial diﬀerential equations in Eulerian variables for v and ˇa,
describing the elastoplastic deformation process in the entire space–time domain
occupied by the medium. All equations are given in the form solved for the total
time derivative, which makes the system suitable for numerical solution.1

2 Some notation and conventions

We assume that the real space in which the continuous medium moves is the
three-dimensional Euclidean aﬃne space. We denote it by E and the associated
vector space by E. Let h·, ·i and |·| be the scalar product and the corresponding
norm in E.

A frame consisting of vectors ai ∈ E, i = 1, 2, 3, will be denoted by ˇa
and written as a column matrix, so that ˇa := (a1, a2, a3)T , where T stands
for transposition. (For convenience, the entries of a row matrix are separated
by commas.) In the presence of an ambiguity, we always take a nondegenerate
right frame.The symbols := and =: stand for ” is by deﬁnition equal to”, where
the object to be deﬁned is written next to the colon.

Let us deﬁne the norm of a frame in E by the formula kˇak := (|a1|2 + |a2|2 +
|a3|2)1/2 and the diﬀerence of frames by the formula ˇa − ˇb := (a1 − b1, a2 −
b2, a3 − b3)T . The coeﬃcients (contravariant coordinates) in the expansion of
a vector x ∈ E in the vectors of a frame ˇa will be denoted by xˇa
i , or, more
1, xˇa
brieﬂy, by xˇa
i ai. Here and in what
follows, summation from 1 to 3 is assumed over a repeated nonunderlined index
in a monomial.

i ; xˇa := xˇa := (xˇa

3)T . Thus x = xˇa

2, xˇa

The scalar product deﬁned on E can be represented in coordinate form in

1Note that the elastic strain frame was introduced for elastic media in I. A. Solomeshch
and V. Sh. Khalilov, Nonlinear Elasticity Equations in Strain Frame Components [in Russian],
No. 5089-B90, VINITI, Moscow, 1990 and for elastoplastic media in I. A. Solomeshch and
M. A. Solomeshch, Dynamic Elastoplasticity Equations for the Elastic Strain Frame and the
Velocities of Points [in Russian], No. 214-B95, VINITI, Moscow, 1995. The latter paper
indicates the possible connection of the elastic strain frame in polycrystal materials with the
strain of the crystal lattice. In the earlier-mentioned papers [6, 7, 9], frames actually coinciding
with the elastic strain frame are introduced under various names (on the average, the trivector
of microstructure variables) to characterize the elastic strain in such materials.

any frame ˇe orthonormal with respect to this product:

i β ˇe
i
Conversely, for an arbitrary nondegenerate frame ˇa one can construct a scalar
product (generally diﬀerent from h·, ·i) in E by setting

hα, βi = αˇe

∀α, β ∈ E.

(2.1)

hα, βiˇa := αˇa

i β ˇa
i ;

(2.2)

the frame ˇa is orthonormal with respect to this scalar product. The Euclidean
aﬃne space obtained by the replacement of the scalar product h·, ·i by h·, ·iˇa will
be denoted by Eˇa. Obviously, Eˇe = E if the frame ˇe is orthonormal in E.

The modulus of a vector α ∈ E in Eˇa is equal to

|α|ˇa := hα, αi1/2
(2.3)
ˇa .
The volume of the parallelepiped spanned by a frame ˇb in the space E will be
denoted by |ˇb|, and the volume of the same parallelepiped in Eˇa will be denoted
by |ˇb|ˇa.

Nondegenerate frames ˇa and ˇa′ generating the same scalar product, i.e., such

that hα, βiˇa = hα, βiˇa′ for any α, β ∈ E, will be called equivalent .

For frames ˇa and ˇb, by ˇaˇb we denote the matrix whose jth column is aˇb
j.
Matrices are sometimes indicated by the symbol ˆ . For column matrices ˆc :=
(c1, c2, c3)T and ˆd := (d1, d2, d3)T with numerical entries, we write

(ˆc, ˆd) := cidi,

|ˆc| := (ˆc, ˆc)1/2

(2.4)

Let a continuous medium occupying an open spatial domain V ⊂ E at the
initial time t0 ﬁll a domain Vt at the ﬁnal time t. The spatial position of
a particle M at time t0 will be denoted by x (the Lagrangian variable), and
the position of the same particle at time t will be denoted by x (the Eulerian
variable).

The function x = x(x) specifying the correspondence between the initial and
ﬁnal positions of a mass point, as well as the laws of motion considered in what
follows, is assumed to be one-to-one and have an invertible derivative x′
x.

In general, we adhere to the following principle whenever possible: objects
characterizing the medium at the terminal time are denoted by italic Latin
letters, and the corresponding objects at the initial time are denoted by the
same letters typeset in Roman; any function of a particle expressed via x or x is
denoted by same letter with the argument indicated where necessary; notation
introduced for some object is later used for other objects of the same nature.
Unless explicitly speciﬁed otherwise, we assume that all functions occurring in
the text (including the derivatives) are continuous, all curves and surfaces are
smooth, and all sets over which integration is carried out are measurable and
closed. Whenever the metric is not indicated explicitly, the metric of the main
space E is meant.

In the following, to reveal elastic and plastic strains of the medium, we
need to compare the measure of material objects in Riemannian spaces that are
diﬀerent in general. The corresponding mathematical technique is given in the
following section.

3 The change in the measure of geometric ob-
jects under a mapping of Riemannian aﬃne
spaces

3.1. The Riemannian metric generated by a frame ﬁeld. Let V be an open
domain in an aﬃne space E. (Momentarily, it is not important whether E is
Euclidean.) A Riemannian metric on V is usually deﬁned with the help of a
metric form

gij(x(ξ))dξidξj

(3.1)

in some curvilinear coordinate system x = x(ξ). Essentially, formula (3.1)
deﬁnes a scalar product at any point x ∈ V (more precisely, on the tangent
space at x, i.e., in our case, on E). Therefore, one can deﬁne a Riemannian
metric by directly specifying a scalar product at the points of V .

For our purposes, it is convenient to specify each of these products by spec-

ifying a frame orthonormal with respect to this product.

Thus we adopt the following scheme. Let a nondegenerate frame ﬁeld ˇα(x)
be given on V . For the scalar product at a point x we take the product h·, ·i ˇα(x),
with respect to which ˇα(x) is orthonormal (see (2.2)). The Riemannian space
thus deﬁned is said to be generated by the frame ﬁeld ˇα(x) and will be denoted
by V ˇα. The metric in it will be called the ˇα-metric.

The relationship between the coeﬃcients of the metric form and ˇα(x) is as

follows:

gij(x(ξ)) = hki(ξ), kj(ξ)i ˇα(x(ξ))

3.2. The dilatation coeﬃcients under a change of the Riemannian metric.
Let ˇα(x) and ˇβ(x) be nondegenerate frame ﬁelds deﬁned on V , and let V ˇα
and V ˇβ be the Riemannian spaces generated by these frame ﬁelds. Let us ﬁnd
the dilatation coeﬃcients for the measures of one- to three-dimensional objects
under the transition from their measurement in the ˇα-metric to the measurement
in the ˇβ-metric.

The length dilatation coeﬃcient. Take an arbitrary vector m 6= 0. Let
l: x = x(τ ), τ ∈ [τ0, τ1] be an arbitrary curve issuing from the point x0, let
x(τ0) = x0; m be the tangent vector to l at x0, and let lτ ∗ := x([τ0, τ ∗]) for
each τ ∗ ∈ (τ0, τ1].

The length dilatation coeﬃcient at the point x0 in the direction m is com-

puted with the use of (3.4):

K1(x0, m, ˇα, ˇβ) := lim

The volume dilatation coeﬃcient. Take an arbitrary ∀x0 ∈ V . Let v: x =
x(ξ), ξ ∈ ω ⊂ R3, be an arbitrary three-dimensional subdomain of V containing
x0, x0 = x(ξ0); suppose that ω∗ ⊂ ω contains ξ0 and vω∗ := x(ω∗).

The volume dilatation coeﬃcient at the point x0 is computed with the use

of (3.6):

K3(x0, ˇα, ˇβ) := lim
ω∗→ξ0

ω∗ |ˇk(ξ)| ˇβ(x(ξ)) dξ
ω∗ |ˇk(ξ)| ˇα(x(ξ)) dξ
ω∗→ξ0 R

The volume in V ˇβ(x0) of the parallelepiped spanned by ˇk(x0) is equal to

|ˇk(x0)| ˇα(x0)

|vω∗ | ˇβ
|vω∗ | ˇα

= lim

. (3.8)

=

|ˇk(x0)| ˇβ(x0) = |ˇk ˇβ|, and similarly, |ˇk(x0)| ˇα(x0) = |ˇk ˇα|.

We denote ˇα ˇβ =: A; then ˇα = AT ˇβ, and hence the ˇα- and ˇβ-coordinates
of an arbitrary vector y are related by y ˇα = A−1y ˇβ. Therefore, |ˇk| ˇα = |ˇk ˇα| =
|A−1ˇk ˇβ| = |A|−1 · |ˇk| ˇβ. Substituting this into (3.8), we obtain

K3(x0, ˇα, ˇβ) = |A| = |ˇα(x0)| ˇβ(x0).

u = (u1, u2) ∈ σ ⊂ R2, be an arbitrary oriented surface in V with unit positive
ˇβ-normal n at the point x0, x0 = x(u0); we assume that σ∗ ⊂ σ contains u0
and sσ∗ := x(σ∗). The area dilatation coeﬃcient at the point x0 is computed
with the use of (3.5):

(3.10)

From this formula, we conclude that the dilatation coeﬃcient is same as if
1. ˇβ(x) ≡ ˇβ(x0) and ˇα(x) ≡ ˇα(x0),, i.e., both metrics are Euclidean.
2. s lies in the plane Π with positive unit ˇβ-normal n at the point x0.
But in this case the integrands in (3.10) are constants and there is no need

to pass to the limit; i.e.,

K2(x0, n, ˇα, ˇβ) =

∀s ⊂ Π.

(3.11)

|s| ˇβ(x0)
|s| ˇα(x0)

Consider the parallelepiped v spanned by the vectors m, l (parallel to Π), and
n forming a nondegenerate right frame at x0. We denote the parallelogram
spanned by m and l by s and the positive unit ˇα-normal to Π by n,

|v| ˇβ = |s| ˇβ · |n| ˇβ = |s| ˇβ,

|v| ˇα = |s| ˇα · hn, ni ˇα.

Therefore, in view of (3.11) and (3.9),

K2(x0, n, ˇα, ˇβ) =

· hn, ni ˇα = |ˇα| ˇβ · hn, niˇα.

(3.12)

|v| ˇβ
|v| ˇα

Let us ﬁnd n. To this end, we transform the equation of the plane Π in the

ˇβ-metric to the equation in the ˇα-metric.

The equation Π in the ˇβ-metric has the form

where x − x0 =: x, hn, xi ˇβ = (n ˇβ, x ˇβ ). x ˇα = A−1x ˇβ, where A = ˇα ˇβ . Therefore,
hn, xi ˇβ = (n ˇβ, Ax ˇα) = (AT n ˇβ, x ˇα).
If we now introduce the vector N with
ˇα-coordinates

then hn, xi ˇβ = (N ˇα, x ˇα) = hN , xi ˇα.

(3.13)

(3.14)

hn, xi ˇβ = 0,

N ˇα := AT n

ˇβ,

7

By substituting this into (3.13) and by normalizing N in the ˇα-norm, we

obtain the equation of Π in the ˇα-metric:

Hence n = N /|N ˇα|, and using (3.14), we obtain

hN /|N ˇα|, xi ˇα = 0.

n ˇα =

AT n ˇβ
|AT n ˇβ|

.

(3.15)

Now, using the expression of the ˇα-coordinates via the ˇβ-coordinates and

(3.15), we have

hn, ni ˇα = (n ˇα, n ˇα) = (A−1n

ˇβ, AT n

ˇβ)/|AT n
ˇβ| = 1/|AT n

ˇβ|
ˇβ|.

= |n|2

ˇβ/|AT n

By substituting this into (3.12), we obtain

K2(x0, n, ˇα, ˇβ) =

|ˇα(x0)| ˇβ(x0)
|AT n ˇβ|

,

(3.16)

where A = ˇα(x0) ˇβ(x0).

4 The strain frame. The relative stresses

4.1. Material objects (curves, surfaces, three-dimensional regions) are deformed
with respect to the initial state as a result of the displacement x = x(x). One
can characterize the resulting strain by comparing the measures (lengths, areas,
volumes) of these objects, as well as the angles between material curves, at time
t and the initial time t0. Therefore, we characterize all above-mentioned objects
in the strained state, i.e., at time t, both by their geometric measure (length,
area, etc.) at time t and by their initial measure at time t0.

Clearly, the speciﬁcation of x(x) or x′(x) completely determines the terminal
In turn, the operator x′(x) =: A(x) at each point is
strain of the medium.
determined by the speciﬁcation of an arbitrary nondegenerate frame ˇa(x) and
the frame

ˇa(x) := (A(x)a1(x), A(x)a2(x), A(x)a3(x))T =: A(x)ˇa(x);

(4.1)

one even does not need to require that the function ˇa(x) is continuous.

However, if the frames ˇa(x) are orthonormal, then, to specify the strain of
the medium at time t, it suﬃces to deﬁne the frame ˇa(x) alone at each point
x ∈ Vt. (Note that ˇa(x) = ˇa(x) for x = x(x); i.e., ˇa(x) and ˇa(x) specify the
same function of a material point expressed via the Eulerian and Lagrangian
coordinates, respectively.)

8

4.2. Let us prove this. The computation of the geometric measure of the
deformed (i.e., given at time t) material objects does not encounter diﬃculties.
Therefore, assuming that the frame ﬁeld ˇa(x) is given, we focus our attention
on the computation of their initial measure.

Let l, li (i = 1, 2), s, and v be oriented material curves, a surface, and a
three-dimensional region given at the initial time in V; let l := x(l), li := x(li),
s := x(s), and v := x(v) be the same objects at the terminal time; we suppose
that l1 and l2 meet at the point x0; ﬁnally, x0 = x(x0); x = x(τ ); x = xi(τ ),
τ ∈ [τ1, τ2]; x = x(u), u(u1, u2) ∈ σ ⊂ R2, and x = x(ξ), ξ(ξ1, ξ2, ξ3) ∈ ω ⊂ R3
are parametrizations of l, li, s, and v.

To denote the geometric measure of (length, area, or volume) of 1–3-dimensional

objects, we shall use vertical bars. The initial measure of such objects given in
the strained state will be denoted in the same way but with the subscript t. For
example, |l| is the geometric length of l, |v| is the geometric volume of v, and |s|t
is the geometric area of s (i.e., |s|). An geometric angle between vectors n and
n, m), and the initial angle between the same vectors
m will be denoted by (
n, m)x,t. The adjective ”geometric”
issuing from a point x will be denoted by (
for a measure will usually be omitted.

First, let us compute the initial angle between the curves li at the point x0.
For the parametrization of li one can take x = x(xi(τ )) =: xi(τ ). Let τ0 be the
parameter value corresponding to x0 on the curves li; then it also corresponds
to x0 on li.

(4.2)

We need the following lemma.
Lemma.

If A is a linear invertible operator on E, ˇa is a nondegenerate

frame, and ˇa = Aˇa, then for any α, β ∈ E and an arbitrary frame ˇb one has

αˇa = (Aα)ˇa

|α|ˇa = |Aα|ˇa

(4.5)
i ai; i.e., (Aα)ˇa = αˇa.
Proof. We have α = αˇa
Assertions (4.4) readily follow from (4.3) by virtue of deﬁnitions (2.2) and (2.3).
Further, using the Gram determinant, we have

i ai. Therefore, Aα = αˇa

i Aai = αˇa

|ˇb|ˇa = | hbi, bjiˇa|1/2 = | hAbi, Abjiˇa|1/2 = |Aˇb|ˇa,

and the proof of the lemma is complete.

Using (2.1)–(2.3), we compute the cosine of the initial angle between the

curves li at the point x0:

cos(

m1, m2) =

(4.9)

Formulas (4.6)–(4.9) show that, given the frame ﬁeld ˇa(x), one can compute
the initial measure of 1–3-dimensional material objects and the initial angle
between the material curves from the equations of these objects in the strained
state (i.e., at time t). It follows that by specifying the ﬁeld ˇa(x) one completely
determines the strain of the medium at time t.

On the other hand, Eqs. (4.6)–(4.9) show (see Section 3.1) that the origi-
nal metric for deformed material objects is the metric generated by the frame
ﬁeld ˇa(x), i.e., the metric obtained in the Riemannian aﬃne space Vt,ˇa by the

10

replacement of the scalar product h·, ·i common for all points in Vt by the ﬁeld
of scalar products h·, ·iˇa(x), individual for each point x ∈ Vt.

4.3. We take a point x ∈ Vt and a vector m 6= 0. Let l be a material curve
at time t for which m is the tangent vector at the point x. We consider the
length dilatation coeﬃcient for this curve at time t, equal to the ratio |l|/|l|t of
its length at time t to its length in the initial state.

It turn out (see Section 3.2) that the limit of this coeﬃcient as the curve
shrinks along itself to the point x, is independent of the choice of l and depends
only on x and m. We refer to this limit as the length dilatation coeﬃcient at
the point x at time t (i.e., at the point (x, t)) in the direction m and denote it
by K1(x, m).

The area dilatation coeﬃcient K2(x, n) at a point (x, t) of a material surface
with unit normal n at the point x at time t and the volume dilatation coeﬃcient
K3(x) at the point (x, t) are introduced in a similar way.

Since for each orthonormal frame ˇe the scalar product h·, ·i coincides with
h·, ·iˇe, it follows that the geometric measure on Vt coincides with the measure
on Vt,ˇe for any orthonormal frame ﬁeld ˇe(x) on Vt. Furthermore, the initial
metric coincides with the metric in Vt,ˇa. Therefore, Ki is the measure dilatation
coeﬃcient for the passage from the ˇa-metric to the ˇe-metric (i.e., the geometric
metric) in Vt. Hence, according to formulas (3.7), (3.16), and (3.9) with ˇα = ˇa
and ˇβ = ˇe, we have

K1(x, m) =

, K3(x) = |ˇa|,

where A = ˇaˇe.

Formula (4.6), together with (4.10), shows that ˇa(x) completely determines

the strain of the medium at the point (x, t).

Therefore, ˇa(x) will be called the strain frame. Let us give a complete deﬁ-
nition taking into account (4.1) and using derivatives with respect to a vector.

The strain frame of the medium at a point x at time t is deﬁned as

∂x(x)
∂ˇa

:=

∂a1

,

∂x(x)
∂a2

ˇa(x) :=

= x′(x)ˇa ,

= (x′(x)a1, x′(x)a2, x′(x)a3)T

(4.11)

where ˇa is an arbitrary orthonormal frame.

The physical meaning of the strain frame ˇa is clear from the very deﬁnition
of the derivative with respect to a vector in conjunction with (4.10) (which is
in generally not necessary) for m = ai.

The vectors of the frame ˇa are the tangents at the point x to three strained
material ﬁbrils issuing from x and mutually orthogonal at the initial time. More-
over, |ai| is the dilatation coeﬃcient of the material at x at time t in the direction
ai.

Restating the last paragraph in Section 4.2, we can say that the speciﬁcation
of the strain frame ﬁeld permits one to introduce a Riemannian metric on Vt

11

such that the measurement of angles between deformed material curves and of
lengths, areas, and volumes of deformed 1–3-dimensional material objects in
this metric gives the values of the respective characteristics for the objects in
question prior to strain without resorting to their initial state.

The strain frame is not unique. By taking another orthonormal frame ˇa′ in
the undeformed medium, we obtain another strain frame ˇa′ := Aˇa′ by (4.11).
Obviously, the frames ˇa and ˇa′ characterize the same strain.

Note that the values of the expressions (4.6) and (4.10) do not change if the

frame ˇa is replaced by an equivalent frame.

4.4. We take a point x in the deformed medium and a unit vector n. The
stress per unit geometric area at the point x at time t on the oriented plane with
positive normal n will be called the geometric stress (the Cauchy stress [12], or
the true stress [13]) and will be denoted by σn(x). The stress per unit initial
area will be referred to as relative (to the initial area).

The geometric measure on Vt coincides with the measure on Vt,ˇe for any
orthonormal frame ﬁeld ˇe(x) on Vt, and the initial measure, as was already
mentioned, coincides with the measure on Vt,ˇa.

Generalizing, for an arbitrary nondegenerate frame ﬁeld ˇb(x) deﬁned on Vt,
we introduce the stress un(x, ˇb) per unit area in the Riemannian space Vt,ˇb,
which will be called the relative stress (relative to ˇb(x)). The symbol ˇb is omitted
if it is clear what frame is meant.

The geometric stress and the stress relative to the initial area are the special

cases of un(x, ˇb) for ˇb(x) = ˇe(x) and ˇb(x) = ˇa(x), respectively.

4.5. We introduce the following notation. Let bi be one of the vectors in the
frame ˇb. By ni(ˇb) we denote the unit normal to the plane spanned by the other
two vectors of ˇb; we assume that ni(ˇb) points to the same side of this plane as
bi. Next, ui(x, ˇb) := uni(ˇb)(x, ˇb) are the relative stresses on the faces of the
frame ˇb(x) at the point (x, t); n is the unit positive normal to a plane Π passing
through x; n is the unit positive normal to the same plane in the metric Vt,ˇb (it
will be called the ˇb-normal); (n1, n2, n3)T := nˇb.

One can prove the generalized Cauchy relation
un(x, ˇb) = ui(x, ˇb)ni
for the relative stresses in completely the same way as the classical Cauchy
relation between the Cauchy (geometric) stresses on the plane Π and the faces
of ˇe for an orthonormal frame ˇe.

(4.12)

Introducing the frame

ˇu(x, ˇb) :=

(4.13)
of relative stresses on the faces of ˇb(x), we can rewrite the dependence (4.12) in
the form

u1(x, ˇb), u2(x, ˇb), u3(x, ˇb)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

T

ˇb.
un(x, ˇb) = ˇu(x, ˇb)T n

(4.14)

4.6. Let us establish the connection between the relative stress frames for
diﬀerent initial frame ﬁelds. We take a point x ∈ Vt and two arbitrary nonde-
generate frames ˇa and ˇb at x. (The values of the frames at any other points are

12

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

irrelevant.) Suppose that ˇu(x, ˇa) is known. Let us compute the stress ui(x, ˇb)
on the ith face of ˇb. We denote the unit positive normal, the ˇa-normal, and
the ˇb-normal to this face by m, n, and n, respectively; next, A := ˇaˇb, B := ˇbˇa,
and ˆi is the column with unit in the ith position and zeros in the remaining
positions. Then n = bi and hence

since ˇa = AT ˇb, it follows that ˇb = A−T ˇa and hence

ˇb = ˆi;
n

B = A−1.

By formulas (3.15) and (3.16), the area dilatation coeﬃcient for the transi-

tion from the ˇa-measure to the ˇb-measure is equal to

K2(x, n) =

and nˇa =

|ˇa|ˇb
|AT nˇb|

Using (4.17), (4.14), and (4.15), we obtain

ˇb

and since, according to (4.16), the ˇb-volume |ˇa|ˇb of the parallelepiped spanned
by ˇa is equal to the determinant |A| = |B|−1, we have

ˇu(x, ˇb) = |B|B−1 ˇu(x, ˇa).

(4.18)

This is the desired relation between the relative stresses.

Let us clarify the relationship between the matrice Uˇa of decomposition
of ˇu(x, ˇa) with respect to the frame ˇa and matrice Uˇb of decomposition of
ˇu(x, ˇb) with respect to the frame ˇb. Successively substituting ˇu(x, ˇa) = U T
ˇa ˇa
ˇa B−T ˇb and hence
and ˇa = B−T ˇb into (4.18), we have ˇu(x, ˇb) = |B|B−1U T
Uˇb = |B|B−1UˇaB−T . Thus the matrix of decomposition of the frame of rel-
ative stresses on the faces of the frame ˇa with respect to ˇa changes under the
replacement of ˇa by ˇb as the matrix of some contravariant pseudotensor of rank 2
and weight 1. It will be called the relative stress pseudotensor at the point x.

5 The equilibrium equations with respect to

an arbitrary frame ﬁeld

Suppose that a nondegenerate frame ﬁeld ˇb(x) of class C1 is given in V and an
orthonormal frame ˇe is ﬁxed. Let F (x) and Ψ(x, ˇb) be the mass force density
at the point x per unit volume (geometric density) and per unit relative ˇb-
volume (relative density), respectively, and let σi(x) := ui(x, ˇe) be the Cauchy
(geometric) stress at x on the ith face of ˇe.

(5.5)

Since the volume dilatation coeﬃcient (3.9) for the transition from the ˇb-

volume to the geometric volume is equal to |ˇb|, we have Ψ(x, ˇb) = F (x)|ˇb|.

The force and moment equilibrium equations for geometric stresses (e.g., see

[13]) read

where Σ := ˇσˇe and the xi are the coordinates of x in the Cartesian coordinate
system with coordinate frame ˇe. By (4.18), we have

∂σi
∂xi

+ F (x) = 0, Σ = ΣT ,

ˇσ = |ˇb |−1B ˇu,

where B = ˇbˇe and hence σi(x) = |ˇb(x)|−1bij(x)uj(x, ˇb). Therefore,

The ﬁrst term in (5.3) is equal to

ˇe = B−T ˇb

Let δij be the Kronecker delta, and let bij be the entries of the matrix B−1.
Using the linearity of the derivative with respect to a vector in the vector and
the fact that ˇb = BT ˇe, i.e.,

and hence ei = bki(x)bk(x), we see that the second term in (5.3) is equal to

ˇu = |ˇb|B−1ΣT B−T ˇb. We see that the matrix U is equal to |ˇb|B−1ΣB−T and
hence (see (5.1)) is symmetric.

uj + Ψ = 0.

(cid:18)

Therefore, the moment equilibrium equation for the relative stresses is also
reduced to the symmetry condition for a matrix, in this case, for the matrix U :

U = U T .

need not be the coordinate frame ﬁeld of any curvilinear coordinate system.

6 The elastic strain frame. The elastic state

equation

6.1. We momentarily assume that the medium in question is elastic, was in the
natural (unstressed) state at the initial time, and was subjected only to elastic
strains until time t. In this case, the initial metric of the deformed medium will
be referred to as the natural metric; accordingly, the stress un(x, ˇa) per unit
natural area will be called the natural stress (it is also known as the conditional
stress vector [13] and the ﬁrst Piola–Kirchhoﬀ stress vector [12]) and will be
denoted by tn(x). The density Ψ(x, ˇa) of mass forces per unit natural volume
will also be called the natural density and will be denoted by Φ(x).

Now the strain frame deﬁned by formula (4.11) completely characterizes the
elastic strain of the medium at the point (x, t). It will be called the elastic strain
frame.

Since only natural stresses and densities are used in what follows, we usually

omit the word “natural.”

relation [12, 13]

The Cauchy relation (4.12) passes for the natural stresses into the well-known

tn(x0) = ti(x0, ˇa)ni,
(6.1)
where ti(x0, ˇa) := tni(ˇa)(x0), n is the unit ˇa-normal at the point x to the plane
orthogonal to n, and (n1, n2, n3)T := nˇa.
Recall that, according to (4.17),

nˇa =

AT nˇe
|AT nˇe|

, A = ˇaˇe

(6.2)

for ˇb = ˇe.

We assume that the medium in the natural state is homogeneous and isotropic
and that the stress at an arbitrary point x of the deformed medium is completely
determined by strain at x, i.e., by the elastic strain frame ˇa(x).

Using the frame ˇt(x, ˇa) of natural stresses at the point x on the faces of
the frame ˇa(x), we introduce the stress matrix ˆt(x, ˇa) := (tij (x, ˇa)) := ˇtˇa(x, ˇa).
Under our assumptions about the medium, the strain frame ˇa(x) determines the
stress matrix by the following chain of relations [12]: ˇa → ˆεe(ˇa) := (εe
ij(ˇa)) :=
2 (hai, aji − δij )) (the Cauchy–Lagrange elastic strain matrix); ˆεe → ˆf (ˆεe) :=
( 1
(fij(ˆεe)), where fij are functions of class C1 characterizing the elastic properties
of the medium; ˆt(x, ˇa(x)) = ˆf (ˆεe(ˇa(x))).

Thus the equations of the elastic state of the medium can be represented in

ˆt(x, ˇa(x)) = ˆf (ˆεe(ˇa(x))),

(6.3)

the form

or

ti(x, ˇa(x)) = fji(ˆεe(ˇa(x)))aj(x),

(6.4)
Thus the matrix ˆt(x, ˇa), which is a special case of U (see Section 5), is
symmetric, and the principal stress frame is coaxial with the principal strain
frame.

i = 1, 2, 3.

15

Since in our case the functions ˆt, ˇt, and ti depend only on the frame ˇa(x),

the ﬁrst argument x of these functions can be omitted in what follows.

6.2. Now consider an elastoplastic medium in the process of elastoplastic
deformation. First, we assume that, at any time t of the process, the medium,
or at least a suﬃciently small neighborhood of any point of the medium, can
be unloaded to a natural state by an elastic deformation. We treat this natural
state and the state at time t as the initial undeformed state and the state
obtained from it by an elastic deformation, respectively. Then (see 6.1) there
exists an elastic strain frame at time t at each point of the medium.

There also exists a similar frame ﬁeld under more general assumptions. In
general, even a small neighborhood of a point cannot be unloaded to an un-
stressed state. There always remain residual stresses. However, one can assume
that these stresses tend to zero as the neighborhood shrinks into the point, and
so the unloaded states tend to an unstressed state.

We take an arbitrary point x of the deformed medium at time t. Let v be
a neighborhood of x. Let us unload the part of the medium contained in v and
consider the strain frame ˇav(x, t) at x, corresponding to the displacement of
the unloaded part to its position at time t. Suppose that there exists a limit
lim ˇav(x, t) =: ˇa(x, t) as v → x and that the ﬁeld ˇa(x, t) is continuous.

Now consider an arbitrary material curve in the deformed medium. We cover
it by ﬁnitely many balls of radius r and cut into ﬁnitely many partial curves
each of which entirely lies in one of the balls. By unloading the part of the
medium lying in a ball, we obtain the ”unloaded” length of the corresponding
partial curve. We deﬁne the ”unloaded” length of the entire curve as the sum
of unloaded lengths of its parts.

One can show that the unloaded lengths of the curve tend as r → 0 to a limit,
which will be called the ”natural” length of the material curve in question. The
natural measures of material surfaces, volumes, and angles can be deﬁned in a
similar way. It turns out that the natural measure deﬁned thus constructed for
material objects coincides with their measure in the Riemannian space generated
on Vt by the frame ﬁeld ˇa(x, t).

Thus in both cases at any time t at each point of the medium there exists a
frame determining how the measure of 1–3-dimensional material objects at time
t has changed compared with their natural measure. It is this property of the
frame that is important in what follows.

Therefore, let us introduce a notion of elastic strain frame for elastoplastic
media generalizing the corresponding notion for elastic media and based neither
on any concept of actual motion of the medium nor on any assumptions related
to full or partial unloading of parts of the medium.

Suppose that at each time the medium has some ”elastic structure”, which
permits one to judge about the natural measure near each point of the medium.
More precisely, we shall adopt the following assumption.

Assumption. For each given time t, to each point x of the medium one can
assign a nondegenerate frame ˇa(x, t) (which will be called the elastic strain frame
of the medium at the point (x, t)) such that the Riemannian metric generated
in Vt by the ﬁeld ˇa(x, t) (the metric of the space Vt,ˇa) is ”natural.”

16

Remark.
1. The ”naturality” of a measure, which is clear if full unloading is possible,
is deﬁned as certain relationships, postulated below, with the stress and the
plastic strain.

2. In a polycrystal material, crystal lattices can serve as a prototype of an

”elastic structure.”

The elastic strain frame ﬁeld on Vt is not unique. Indeed, if ˇa(x, t) is an
elastic strain frame ﬁeld, then for a frame ﬁeld ˇa′(x, t) to be an elastic strain
frame ﬁeld it is necessary and suﬃciently that these ﬁelds be equivalent, i.e.,
that the frames ˇa(x, t) and ˇa′(x, t) be equivalent for all x ∈ Vt.

Indeed, if the ﬁelds ˇa and ˇa′ are equivalent, then these frames generate equal
scalar products at each point. Consequently, the Riemannian metrics generated
by the ﬁelds ˇa and ˇa′ coincide; i.e., ˇa′ also generates a natural metric and hence
is an elastic strain frame ﬁeld. The necessity can also be easily justiﬁed.

The following lemma will be often used in the sequel.
Lemma. For nondegenerate frames ˇa and ˇa′ to be equivalent, it is necessary

and suﬃciently that there be an orthogonal 3 × 3 matrix Q such that

ˇa′ = Qˇa.

(6.5)

Indeed, let the frames be equivalent: ∀α, β
We denote Q := (ˇa′ˇa)T ; then ˇa′ = Qˇa. Since each of the frames is or-
thogonal with respect to the scalar product generated by it, it follows that
δij = ha′
jiˇa = hqikak, qjlaliˇa = qikqjlhak, aliˇa = qikqjlδkl for
any i and j, i.e., qikqjk = δij and hence Q is orthogonal. The suﬃciency can be
proved even easier.

7 The plastic strain tensor

To characterize plastic strain, we need additional information on the change in
the measure of geometric objects undergoing deformation.

7.1. The measure dilatation coeﬃcients for the mapping of V ˇα into V ˇβ. Here
the situation is the same as in Sections 4.2–4.3; V ˇα plays the role of the domain
of the initial position of the medium, V ˇβ plays the role of the domain Vt of the
ﬁnal position of the medium, ˇα(x) is used instead of ˇa(x), and the ˇβ-measure is
used instead of the geometric measure in Vt. We introduce the frame

which plays the role of ˇa(x) in 4.2–4.3. Arguing as in 4.2–4.3, we arrive at the
conclusion that the ˇa - measure of objects in V coincides with the ˇα-measure of
their preimages in V. But then the following assertion holds.

Assertion. The measure dilatation coeﬃcients comparing the ˇα-measure of
1–3-dimen-sional objects in V with the ˇβ-measure of their images in V are given
by formulas (3.7), (3.9), and (3.16) with ˇα replaced by ˇa.

m1, m2)x, ˇα is the angle between m1 and m2 at the point x in the ˇα-

d

In what follows, we consider a medium that moves during the time
d
interval [tb, te] =: T and is elastoplastic (in the sense of Section 6.2) at each
time t ∈ T . All earlier-introduced assumptions and the main notation are
preserved; we only introduce an additional variable, time (t), which occurs as
an argument of the functions specifying the law of motion of the medium, the
elastic strain frame, the velocities v(x, t) of points of the medium, etc.

Let W := {(x, t)| t ∈ T, x ∈ Vt}. Let ˇa(x, t) be an elastic strain frame ﬁeld
of the medium of the class C1(W ). We take an arbitrary t0 ∈ T and denote the
law of motion of the medium starting from time t0 by

x = xt0 (x, t).

(7.2)

To each point x in space, this law assigns the spatial position x at time t ∈ T
of the material point residing at x at time t0. We shall assume that xt0 ∈
C2(Vt0 × T ).

The comparison of natural measures of material objects at time t and t0

characterizes the plastic strain of the medium on the interval [t0, t].

Just as the frame ﬁeld ∂x/∂ˇa on Vt, where ˇa deﬁnes the geometric measure
at the initial time (since E = Eˇa), completely characterizes the change in the
geometric measure of material objects (see Section 4.3), so the frame ﬁeld

ˇb(x, t) :=

∂xt0 (x, t)
∂ˇa(x, t0)

,

(x = xt0 (x, t)),

(7.3)

where ˇa(x, t0) deﬁnes the natural metric on Vt0 at time t0, completely charac-
terizes the change in the natural measure of material objects in time [t0, t], i.e.,
the plastic strain on this time interval (the elastic strain frame ﬁeld ˇa(x, t) on
Vt and Vt0 being known).

Indeed, we take ∀x0 ∈ Vt0 and x0 := xt0 (x0, t) and momentarily set ˇa(x0, t0) =:

ˇa0 =: (a0
in Section 7.1 (with ˇa as ˇβ and ˇb as ˇa), the natural length dilatation coeﬃcient
at a point (x0, t) in an arbitrary direction m is equal to

2, a0

˜K1(x0, t) =

|m|ˇa
|m|ˇb

.

(7.4)

Moreover, for two arbitrary nonzero vectors m1 and m2 at x0, one can take
oriented material curves for which these vectors are the positive tangent vectors
at the point x0 at time t and introduce the positive tangent vectors mi to these
curves at time t0 at the point x0.

18

Now, using the properties of the elastic strain frame ˇa (see the assumption
m1, m2)x0,t

in Section 6, (4.6), and (7.1) with ˇα = ˇa0), for the material angle (
m1, m2)x0,t0 we have
and the corresponding (

cos (m1ˆ,m2)x0,t =

hm1, m2iˇa
|m1|ˇa|m2|ˇa

cos (m1ˆ,m2)x0,t0 =

hm1, m2iˇa0
|m1|ˇa0|m2|ˇa0

=

hm1, m2iˇb
|m1|ˇb|m2|ˇb

d

(7.5)

Thus the speciﬁcation of ˇb for known ˇa permits one to compute the natural
length dilatation coeﬃcient at x0 at time t in any direction m (see (7.4)) and,
for any material curves issuing from x0 at time t, compute the cosines of the
natural angles between them at the point x0 at time t and at the point x0 at
time t0 (see (7.5)).

In particular, for the vectors bi of the frame ˇb, we have bˇb

i = ˆi and |bi|ˇb = 1.
Hence (see (7.4) and (7.5)) |bi|ˇa is the material length dilatation coeﬃcient along
bi, bj)x0,t = hbi, bjiˇa/(|bi|ˇa|bj|ˇa),
bi at the point x0 at time t; moreover, cos(
while the cosine of the material angle between the corresponding vectors a0
i and
a0

j of the frame ˇa0 at x0 at time t0 (see (7.5)) is zero for i 6= j.

d

We see that the frame ˇb plays the same role in determining the plastic strain

of the medium in time [t0, t] as ˇa plays in determining the elastic strain.

By analogy with the Cauchy–Lagrange elastic strain matrix, we introduce

the plastic strain matrix at a point x0 from time t0:

ˆεp :=

1
2 (hbi, bjiˇa − δij)
(cid:1)

(cid:0)

=:

ˆγ − 1
2

.

By introducing the matrix B := ˇbˇa and by taking into account the deﬁnition of
the scalar product h·, ·iˇa, we obtain

The physical meaning of ˆεp is the same as that of ˆεe with the only diﬀerence
that geometric lengths and angles are replaced by natural ones. Let us study
how ˆεp changes if we replace the elastic strain frame ˇa0 at the point (x0, t0) by
the equivalent frame ˇa′
0. It suﬃces keep track of the change in ˆγ. We denote
Q0 := ((ˇa′

0)ˇa0 )T ; then

For the objects ˇb′, B′, (ˆεp)′, and ˆγ′ corresponding to ˇa′

0 to belong to the

class C1, we replace the ﬁeld ˇa(x, t) by an equivalent ﬁeld ˇa′(x, t) such that

ˆγ = BT B.

ˇa′
0 = Q0ˇa0.

(7.6)

(7.7)

(7.8)

ˇa′(x, t) = Q(x, t)ˇa(x, t),

where Q(x, t) is a C1 ﬁeld of orthogonal matrixes (see the lemma in Section 6)
and Q(x0, t0) = Q0. Now, in view of (7.3), (7.7) and (7.8), we obtain

ˇb′ =

∂xt0 (x0, t)
∂ˇa′(x0, t0)

=

∂xt0 (x0, t)
∂x

0 = Q0ˇb = Q0BT ˇa = Q0BT QT ˇa′.
ˇa′

19

It follows that

B′ = QBQT
0 .
0 = Q0ˆγQT

(7.9)

Therefore, ˆγ′ = B′T B′ = Q0BT BQT

0 ; i.e., ˆγ is the matrix of some
covariant rank two tensor γ in the frame ˇa0. This tensor is deﬁned at (x0, t0)
for elastic strain frames and depends on time.

Hence the same it true for ˆεp and for the tensor εp of plastic strain at the

point x0 from time t0.

In general, the present paper deals only with rank two tensors, and since
all of them are associated only with elastic strain frames, it follows that the
matrices of transformation from one frame to another are orthogonal, so that
the tensors are covariant.

Remark. The tensor εp is diﬀerent from the tensor, traditionally denoted
by the same letter, deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the full and elastic strain
tensors or reckoned from the initial time.

Let us introduce the plastic strain rate tensor ζ(x0, t0) at the point (x0, t0).
By deﬁnition, it is equal to the total t-derivative at time t0 of the plastic strain
tensor at the point x0 reckoned from time t0,

ζ(x0, t0) = (dεp/dt)|t0

.

(7.10)

8 The strain consistency equation

On the mass point trajectory passing through x0 at time t0, we have

∂xt0 (x0, t)
∂x

ˇa(x0, t0) = (B(x, t))T ˇa(x, t), x = xt0 (x0, t)

according to (7.3). By taking the total t-derivative of this identity at t = t0 and
by changing the order of diﬀerentiation on the left-hand side, we obtain

∂v(x0, t0)
∂ˇa(x0, t0)

=

satisﬁed at the point (x0, t0) by any elastic strain frame ﬁeld ˇa and by the
corresponding B (since we deal with a speciﬁc motion of the medium, the ﬁeld
v is ﬁxed).

By taking the total t-derivative of (7.9), for t = t0 we obtain the law describ-
ing how the matrix dB/dt|t0 changes under the passage to an arbitrary elastic
strain frame ﬁeld ˇa′(x, t) (see (7.8)):

For this law to be a tensor law on W , it is necessary and suﬃcient that

dQ(x0, t0)
dt

= 0 ∀(x0, t0) ∈ W,

(8.3)

i.e. that Q(x, t) be constant along the space-time trajectories of the points of
the medium.

We say that elastic strain frame ﬁelds ˇa and ˇa′ related by formula (7.8) with

Q satisfying (8.3) are kinematically equivalent.

Thus the set of elastic strain frame ﬁelds splits into classes of kinematically
equivalent ﬁelds, and the matrix dB/dt|t0 varies according to the tensor law on
each of the classes.

These classes are suﬃciently ample; namely, the following assertion is valid:
if ˇa(x, t) is an elastic strain frame ﬁeld of the medium in W , then for each t0 and
each elastic strain frame ﬁeld ˇa0(x) given at time t0 on Vt0 there exists a ﬁeld
ˇa∗(x, t) kinematically equivalent to ˇa(x, t) and coinciding with ˇa0(x) at time t0.
Indeed, let Q0(x) be the ﬁeld of orthogonal matrices such that ˇa0(x) =
Q0(x)ˇa(x, t0). We introduce a ﬁeld of orthogonal matrices on W by setting
Q(x, t0) = Q0(x) and by requiring that Q(x, t) does not vary along the tra-
jectories of the points of the medium. Let ˇa∗(x, t) := Q(x, t)ˇa(x, t); then ﬁrst,
ˇa∗(x, t0) := Q(x, t0)ˇa(x, t0) = ˇa0(x) and second, the ﬁeld ˇa∗ is kinematically
equivalent to ˇa(x, t), since dQ(x, t)/dt = 0.

Assumption. For the medium, there exists an elastic strain frame ﬁeld of the
class C1(W ) for which the matrix dB/dt|t0 is symmetric on W . We say that
this ﬁeld is kinematically constrained.

Remark 8.1.

It is shown in the paper mentioned second in the footnote
in Section 1 that if the law of motion of the medium is of the class C3, then
the existence of a kinematically constrained ﬁeld automatically follows from the
existence of at least one elastic strain frame ﬁeld of the class C2.

It turns out that the set of kinematically constrained elastic strain frame

ﬁelds is a class of kinematically equivalent elastic strain frame ﬁelds.

Indeed, if ˇa is a kinematically constrained elastic strain frame ﬁeld and
ˇa′ is a kinematically equivalent ﬁeld, then (dB′/dt)|t0 = Q0(dB/dt)|t0 QT
0 by
(8.2), and hence this matrix is symmetric (since so is dB/dt|t0 ); thus ˇa′ is
if elastic strain frame
also kinematically constrained. On the other hand,
ﬁelds ˇa and ˇa′ are kinematically constrained, then the matrices dB/dt|t0 and
dB′/dt|t0 are symmetric, and hence so is
0 (see (8.2)). Conse-
quently, (dQ/dt)|t0 QT

0 = Q0(dQT /dt)|t0 , and hence

dQ/dt|t0

since QQT = I. Thus dQ/dt|t0 = 0; i.e., ˇa and ˇa′ are kinematically equivalent.
The class of kinematically constrained elastic strain frame ﬁelds plays a
special role. Let ˇa be a kinematically constrained elastic strain frame ﬁeld, and
let (x0, t0) be an arbitrary point in W . Taking into account the symmetry of

21

dB/dt|t0 , the relation B|t0 = I, and formulas (7.10) and (7.6), we obtain the
following expression for the matrix ζ(x0, t0) in the frame ˇa0:

(8.4)

which is satisﬁed in W by each kinematically constrained elastic strain frame
ﬁeld.

The physical meaning of Eq. (8.4) becomes clear if we remember how (8.1)
the material rate ∂v(x, t)/∂ˇa(x, t) due to the motion of the
was obtained:
medium of the frame coinciding with ˇa(x, t) at the point (x, t) at time t is
equal to the material rate dˇa(x, t)/dt of the elastic strain frame plus a correc-
tion term depending on the matrix of the plastic strain rate tensor in the frame
ˇa.

Remark 8.2. For ”small” elastic strains, more precisely, under the assump-
tion that there exists an orthonormal frame ˇe and a number δ << 1 such that
|ai − ei| and |∂ai/∂xj|, |∂ai/∂t|, |∂v/∂xi| ≤ δ, it follows from (8.1), neglecting
quantities of the order of δ2, that

tion that essentially substitutes the traditional equation
(Although this substitution is not justiﬁed, it leads to correct results in our
situation.)

9 The elastic and plastic constitutive equations

for
elastoplastic media ”homogeneous and isotropic
in the natural state”

We understand the media speciﬁed in the title as media possessing the following
properties.

Assumption 9.1. Under elastoplastic deformation, the elastic strain frames
and the natural stresses are related by the same elastic constitutive equation
(6.3)≡(6.4) as in the case of elastic media homogeneous and isotropic in the
natural state.

22

Let ˇa∗ be the principal elastic strain frame at a point (x, t) ∈ W ; then,
by Assumption 9.1, the principal frame ˇt(ˇa∗) = (t1(ˇa∗), t2(ˇa∗), t3(ˇa∗))T of nat-
ural stresses on the faces of ˇa∗ and the frame ˇa∗ are coaxial; here ti(ˇa∗) are
the principal natural stresses. The only possible nonzero coordinate ti(ˇa∗)
in the frame ˇa∗ is tii(ˇa∗) =: ti(ˇa∗) will also be referred to as the principal
stress, which, in view of our notation, will not lead to a misunderstanding;
(t1(ˇa∗), t2(ˇa∗), t3(ˇa∗)) =: t(ˇa∗).

Assumption 9.2. If ˇa∗ is the principal elastic strain frame of the medium at a
point (x, t), then the tensor ζ(x, t) is coaxial to ˇa∗ for all (x, t) ∈ W ; moreover,
there exist known functions pi : R3 → R (i = 1, 2, 3), describing the plastic
properties of the medium such that

ζˇa∗ (x, t) =

p1(t(ˇa∗))
0
0

0
p2(t(ˇa∗))
0

0
0
p3(t(ˇa∗))

=: P (t(ˇa∗)).

(9.1)

Remark. 1. Thus the medium in question is so far ”perfectly plastic” in
the sense that the plastic strain rates are independent of the strain history and
depend only on the principal stresses.

2. The assumption that ζˇa∗ depends only on the principal stresses and is
independent of the stress increments seems to us to be quite natural for ”slow”
deformations.

3. Using the technique applied in the study of the yield locus of an isotropic

material (e.g., see [14]), one can readily show that

For an arbitrary elastic strain frame ˇa at a point (x, t), by R we denote the
orthogonal matrix such that ˇa = Rˇa∗. Then ζˇa = Rζˇa∗ RT , and the plastic
constitutive equation of the medium (9.1) can be represented in the form

ζˇa(x, t) = RP (t(ˇa∗))RT

∀(x, t) ∈ W.

(9.2)

10 The system of elastoplastic strain equations

in the Eulerian variables

Let us summarize our study. We consider an elastoplastic medium satisfying the
assumptions in Sections 6 and 8 and moving in a space-time domain W . The
natural density Φ(x, t) of applied mass forces of the class C(W ) and the den-
sity ρ0 of the undeformed medium are known. The unknowns are the velocity
ﬁeld v(x, t) of the points of the medium and any of the kinematically equiva-
lent kinematically constrained elastic strain frame ﬁelds ˇa(x, t) of the medium,
where ˇa and v are related by two equations, namely, the strain consistency
equation (8.4) (or (8.1) is ˇa not kinematically constrained) and the equation of
motion obtained from the force equilibrium equation (5.6) by the substitution
of ˇa(x, t) for ˇb(x). Here the relative stresses ui(x) become the natural stresses

23

ti(x, t), and the mass forces include also inertial forces; i.e., Ψ(x) is replaced
by Φ(x, t) − ρ0(dv/dt).

These equations are valid for any media with an ”elastic structure.” Along
with the unknowns ˇa and v, they also contain the natural stress frame ˇt and
a matrix describing the plastic strain; therefore, to obtain a closed system, one
should supplement these equations with equations describing the elastic and
plastic properties of the material.

For media homogeneous and isotropic in the undeformed state, i.e., satisfying
Assumptions 9.1 and 9.2, the supplementing equations are the elastic and plastic
constitutive equations (6.4) and (9.2).

Thus the system of dynamic equations of elastoplastic strain in this case has

(10.2)

(10.3)

The total derivatives in (10.1) are expressed via v and ˇa as follows:

System (10.1) (in view of (10.2)) is a system of a vector equation and a frame
equation for the vector function v and the frame function ˇa. In vector form, it
consists of four equations for v and ai (i = 1, 2, 3).

The equations are represented in coordinate-free form. After the introduc-
tion of some coordinate system and the replacement of derivatives along vectors
by their expressions via partial derivative with respect to coordinates, one ob-
tains a system of quasilinear ﬁrst-order partial diﬀerential equations.

Equations (10.1) are solved for the time derivatives of the desired functions,

which makes the system suitable for numerical time-marching solution.

If the functions pi describing the plastic properties of the medium depend
not only on the principal stresses but also on parameters determined by the
strain history, then one should supplement the system with equations relating
these parameters to the desired functions.

In the absence of plastic strains (pi = 0), system (10.1) passes into system

(41) of elasticity equations.2

Abstract

A simple mathematical procedure is introduced which allows redeﬁning in a
precise way divergent integrals and limits that appear in the basic equations
of classical electrodynamics with point charges. In this way all divergences are
at once removed without aﬀecting the locality and the relativistic covariance
of the theory, and with no need for mass renormalization. The procedure pro-
vides ﬁnite expressions for the total energy-momentum of the system as well
as for the lagrangian, from which the equations of motion of both particles
and ﬁelds can be derived via Hamilton’s variational principle. They corre-
spond to the Maxwell equations with point-like sources for the ﬁelds and to
the relativistic Lorentz-Dirac equation for the particles, which turns out to be
a second-order diﬀerential equation when the force acting on the particle is
expressed in terms of the total interacting electromagnetic ﬁeld. The hamil-
tonian formulation of the theory can be obtained in a straightforward way.
This leads to an interesting comparison between the resulting divergence-free
expression of the hamiltonian functional and the standard renormalization
rules for perturbative quantum electrodynamics.

The above considerations illustrate the obvious fact that the singularities associated with
point charges are completely harmless in the case of electrostatics, since the physics can be
completely described by ﬁnite quantities such as (1.4). In the present paper we shall show the

(1.4)

2

remarkable fact that an analogous result actually holds also for relativistic electrodynamics.
In fact, using simple mathematical procedures of the same type as that followed above to
pass from Eq. (1.3) to Eq. (1.4), it is possible to obtain in a natural way a divergence-free
covariant canonical formulation of point-charge electrodynamics. In this case, in addition
to the position and velocity of the particles, the dynamical variables of the system must
include the four-vector electromagnetic potential Aµ(x) and its ﬁrst-order derivatives. The
resulting equations of motion of the theory will be the usual Maxwell equations for the
ﬁeld and a second order equation for the particle motion that, when coupled with the ﬁeld
equations, becomes consistent with the well-known third-order relativistic Lorentz-Dirac
equation. Therefore the present work can be considered as a full realization of Dirac’s
idea of expressing in hamiltonian form the equation of motion for the electron that he
derived in his classical paper of 1938 [1]. Soon thereafter Dirac produced a second work [2]
speciﬁcally devoted to this issue and to the related problem of quantization, but his tricky
approach suﬀered from serious formal drawbacks and did not lead to further signiﬁcant
developments. No relevant breakthrough in this speciﬁc direction was then provided by the
numerous investigations on point-charge classical electrodynamics subsequently appeared in
the literature (useful overviews can be found in ref. [3]). In the same spirit of Dirac’s early
works in this ﬁeld, we believe that the hamiltonian formulation discussed in the present
paper represents a valuable tool to improve our understanding of the connection between
classical and quantum electrodynamics.

In Sec. II we shall deﬁne the renormalized energy-momentum associated with the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld in the presence of point charges, and we shall discuss how the conservation
of the sum of this energy-momentum and the familiar mechanical term associated with the
particles (with mass parameter equal to the observable mass m) determines the equation
of motion of the particles, provided that the ﬁeld satisﬁes the usual Maxwell equations.
Actually, this provides a new rigorous and straightforward derivation of the relativistic
Lorentz-Dirac equation. We shall comment on the mathematical structure of the system
of coupled equations of motion for particles and ﬁelds, and on the non-trivial constraints
that are to be imposed on the initial data of the corresponding Cauchy problem. In Sec.
III we shall deﬁne the renormalized lagrangian of the system, and we shall show how the
equations of motion of both particles and ﬁelds can be derived from an action principle. We
shall see that on the solutions of the ﬁeld equations the value assumed by our lagrangian
can be approximated by an expression corresponding to an electron of ﬁnite radius r and
q2/8πr, although the canonical forms of the two theories remain essen-
bare mass m0 = m
tially inequivalent even in the limit r
0. In Sec. IV we shall give a precise mathematical
deﬁnition for the partial derivatives of the lagrangian with respect to the particle variables,
and we shall make use of this deﬁnition to put the equations of motion in the standard form
of Euler-Lagrange equations. The reformulation of the theory in the hamiltonian formalism
will then be obtained in a straightforward way via a Legendre transformation. In Sec. V
we shall obtain an equivalent expression for the renormalized hamiltonian in terms of the
Fourier transform of the electromagnetic potential, and in Sec. VI we shall make use of this
expression to illustrate the close relationship with the renormalization rules for the electron
self-energy in perturbative quantum electrodynamics.

II. CONSERVATION LAWS AND EQUATIONS OF MOTION

A. The electromagnetic energy-momentum in the presence of point charges

As a ﬁrst step, we will proceed to deﬁne the energy-momentum associated with the
electromagnetic ﬁeld in the presence of point charges, in a way that represents the natural
generalization of the procedure used above to obtain the well-known expression (1.4) of the
Coulomb potential energy. To this end, we shall make use of a general limiting procedure
for functions near a ﬁrst-order singular point.

The generalization of the above expression to the electrodynamic case will be obtained
simply by replacing in the integrand the electrostatic energy density (1/2)E2 with the full
electromagnetic energy density T 00 = (1/2) (E2 + B2). The same procedure can then be
applied also with the momentum density T 0k.
In this way, for a given inertial reference
frame we are led to consider as the electromagnetic energy-momentum contained at the
time t in a volume V the quantity

meaningful, the integral on the right-hand side must have a behavior of the form (2.1). It is
possible to prove that this requirement is actually satisﬁed as a consequence of the Maxwell
equations for the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the presence of point charges. In fact, the ﬁeld
near a charged particle can be decomposed as F µν = F µν
ret is the retarded
ﬁeld generated by the particle and F µν

the particle. Under the reasonable assumption that F µν

It can be observed, using the same arguments, that the value of the

of being spherical as in Eq. (2.1), are chosen with a diﬀerent shape, provided that such a
shape be invariant under space inversion with respect to the particle position. Owing to the
form of the expansion (2.4)–(2.6), it turns out that mathematical manipulations are simpler

where the sums on the right-hand sides extend to all the particles contained in the volume
V . One can observe from these expressions the well-known fact that the divergent terms
of the electromagnetic energy-momentum do not transform as a four-vector under Lorentz
transformations. Furthermore, these divergent terms depend only on the particle velocities
and contain no information about the interaction of the particles with each other or with
incident external ﬁelds. These considerations suggest that these terms may be dropped as
it was done for the constant divergent term in Eq. (1.3). In so doing, we are led directly to
the deﬁnition (2.2). However, a rigorous justiﬁcation for this deﬁnition will be provided in
the following subsection.

B. The equations of motion

If no particle is crossing the boundary ∂V of the volume V at the time t, the total ﬂow

of energy-momentum through the surface ∂V is given by

Φµ

now going to show how the application of the above criterion, combined with the deﬁnition
(2.2) for the electromagnetic energy-momentum, univocally determines the dynamics of the
charged particles in a relativistically covariant way. However, in order to formulate the
F µν (zn), which are deﬁned only
equations of motion, we ﬁrst need to introduce the ﬁelds

surface of a sphere of radius r centered at zn(t). Again, one can deduce from Eq. (2.4) and
from symmetry considerations that the r dependence of the integral is indeed of the form
required for the

The proofs of Theorems 1 and 2 are presented in Appendices C and D respectively. It is
important to observe that if we have a single charged particle in uniform rectilinear motion,
and if the ﬁeld at every point of space reduces to that produced by the particle (i.e. it is equal
to the retarded or advanced ﬁelds, which are in this case coincident), then the expression
µ
em(t, r), deﬁned by Eq. (2.8) with V extending to the whole space, is exactly equal to the
P
1/r term alone. From the deﬁnition of
em(t) vanishes, so that
the total energy-momentum is given by P µ = muµ. An analogous result holds for a set of
uniformly moving particles at very large distances from each other. These considerations
imply that the parameters mn appearing in Eqs. (2.16)–(2.17) are to be identiﬁed with the
total physical masses of the particles.

Considering the equation of motion (2.17), we see that the right-hand side has the fa-
F µν instead of the total
miliar structure of the Lorentz force, but with the new ﬁnite ﬁeld
electromagnetic ﬁeld F µν, which of course diverges on the trajectory of the particles. Eq.
(2.17) has the correct mathematical form that an equation of motion in a theory of inter-
acting particles and ﬁelds is supposed to have. It expresses in fact the second-order time
derivative of the particle’s position as a function of the position, its ﬁrst-order derivative
F µν(zn) is a function of the ﬁeld F µν(x, t)
and the instantaneous ﬁeld conﬁguration, since

Since the deﬁnition (2.26) is Lorentz covariant, Eq. (2.28) shows that

trajectory of a point charge interacting with an assigned “external” ﬁeld F µν
ext (given in general
by an incident radiation ﬁeld plus the sum of the retarded ﬁelds generated by other charges).
On the contrary, in our formulation of the theory Eq. (2.17) is a second-order equation which
alone cannot determine the particle’s trajectory, since it is intrinsically coupled with the Eqs.
(2.21) and (2.22) for the total ﬁeld F µν. The three equations need to be solved together
in order to determine the temporal evolution of the system of interacting particles and
ﬁelds. One may observe incidentally that these equations are manifestly invariant under
time reversal, which is not the case for the Lorentz-Dirac equation written in the form
(2.29).

The solution of the system of coupled equations (2.17) and (2.21)–(2.22) depends on a set
of initial conditions that is entirely speciﬁed by the values, at a given time ¯t, of zn(¯t), vn(¯t)
and F µν(x, ¯t) for every x. These initial conditions are subject to some relevant constraints,
in addition to those already expressed by Eqs. (2.23) and (2.24). The reasonable requirement
n (x) be non-singular at zn implies that the divergent part of F µν(x, ¯t) must have

Another subtler constraint on the initial conditions is related to the well-known problem
e
of the “run-away” solutions of the Lorentz-Dirac equation. We remark incidentally that
such solutions do not violate the conservation law given by Eq. (2.20). In fact the unlimited
of the particle’s kinetic energy is compensated by a corresponding
increase towards +
of the electromagnetic energy P 0
decrease towards
em (which is not a deﬁnite positive
quantity, according to our deﬁnition), and analogous statements are valid for the three spatial
components of the momentum. These solutions, which are therefore completely legitimate
from a mathematical standpoint, are generally dismissed for phenomenological reasons, since
run-away electrons have never been observed. We remind that, in the usual treatment of the
Lorentz-Dirac equation as a third-order diﬀerential equation, the initial particle acceleration
has to be speciﬁed among the initial conditions, together with the velocity, the position
and the incident ﬁeld. One may then take advantage of this additional free parameter in
order to get rid of the run-away solutions. For instance, considering a scattering problem
among particles and wave-packets initially very far apart, it is possible in general to obtain
a ﬁnite result for the asymptotic momenta of the particles in the ﬁnal state by introducing a
suitable “preacceleration”, i.e. an acceleration of the particles that decreases as exp(t/γτ0)
23 sec in the case of an electron), and that
for t
10−
becomes signiﬁcant starting from a time of order τ0 before the actual interaction among
incident particles and wave-packets takes place. In our formulation of the Cauchy problem
for the equations (2.17) and (2.21)–(2.22), since the particle equation of motion becomes of
second order, the initial acceleration cannot be independently assigned, but is determined
by the initial value of the total electromagnetic ﬁeld according to Eq. (2.17). Therefore
the requirement that the asymptotic particle momenta be ﬁnite both for t
and for
t
is equivalent to a constraint on the initial values of the ﬁeld. The fact that, in the
traditional “third-order” treatment, the preacceleration is exponentially vanishing for times
t very far in the past with respect to the actual interaction, within the new “second-order”
picture translates into the fact that an equivalently small “adjustment” of an arbitrarily
assigned ﬁeld conﬁguration at the same times t is generally required in order to satisfy the
asymptotic conditions.

III. ACTION PRINCIPLE AND LAGRANGIAN FORMALISM

A fundamental property of the system of diﬀerential equations constituted by Eqs. (2.17)
and (2.21)–(2.24) is that it can be derived from an action principle. A lagrangian formalism
can in fact be introduced in a natural way by taking as conﬁguration variables of the system
the position zn(t) of the particles and the four-vector electromagnetic potential Aµ(x, t)
satisfying the relation

−
Given an inertial system of coordinates, we shall deﬁne as the total lagrangian of the system
at the time t the functional

One can see therefore that L is indeed a functional of the conﬁguration variables and of
their ﬁrst time derivatives, taken at a given time t. In general this functional is deﬁned for
every ﬁeld conﬁguration having a behavior near the singular points such that the
-integral
in Eq. (3.3) and the

-limit in Eq. (3.6) are properly deﬁned.

R

As usual, Eqs. (2.21) and (2.24) are automatically satisﬁed as a result of Eq. (3.1), so
that the equations of motion for the variables zn and Aµ(x) reduce to Eqs. (2.17), (2.22) and
(2.23). We are now going to show that these equations follow from Hamilton’s variational
principle.

Theorem 3 If one deﬁnes the action I as

with L given by Eqs. (3.2)–(3.5), then the equations of motion of the system in the time
interval t1 < t < t2 are equivalent to the condition that δI = 0 for every inﬁnitesimal
variation δAµ(x) and δzn(t) vanishing at t = t1 and t = t2, and such that the varied
trajectories

remain in the deﬁnition domain of I.
The proof of this theorem is given in the two following subsections.

A. Derivation of the ﬁeld equations from the action principle

Let us ﬁx at a ﬁrst stage δzn ≡

0 and consider only variations of the electromagnetic
potential, which will be represented by arbitrary inﬁnitesimal test functions δAµ(x) satisfying
the boundary conditions. We want to show that, in order to have identically δI = 0, the
ﬁelds F µν must deﬁne distributions that satisfy the diﬀerential equations (2.22) and (2.23).
To this end, let us introduce the non-renormalized lagrangian

which is equivalent to Eqs. (2.22) and (2.23). Of course, assuming that the ﬁelds F µν are
represented by ordinary diﬀerentiable functions of x everywhere outside the world-lines of
the particles, Eq. (3.14) implies in particular that in the same region such functions satisfy
the diﬀerential equation ∂µF µν = 0 in the usual sense.

It is well-known that the general solution of Eq. (3.14), when the particle trajectories are
assigned, is given by the sum of the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁelds and a solution of the free-ﬁeld
equations. Using this fact, we are now going to show that the lagrangian L is indeed correctly
deﬁned on the solutions of the ﬁeld equations and on the neighboring trajectories obtained
via non-singular variations δAν of the potential. This fact ensures the self-consistency of the
whole procedure. First of all, since asymptotic conditions of the type (2.4) must be satisﬁed
by the ﬁelds near the particles, we can repeat the same considerations we made about the
-integral in Eq. (2.2), showing that also the right-hand side of Eq. (3.3) is correctly deﬁned.

B. Derivation of the particle equation of motion from the action principle

e

When considering also variations δzn(t)

= 0, one has to pay attention to the fact that the
Aν (zn) is deﬁned only on the world-line of a particle, and so its partial derivatives
quantity
with respect to zn are not deﬁned in the usual sense. This is equivalent to the obvious
= 0 and δAµ(x) = 0, the varied trajectories no longer
statement that, whenever δzn(t)
belong to the deﬁnition domain of the functional L. In order to remain within this domain,
= 0 must be accompanied by a simultaneous variation δAµ of the
each variation δzn(t)
potentials, characterized by an appropriate singular behavior near the particles. For this
reason, it is convenient to proceed in two steps. First, given the boundary conditions at
t = t1 and t = t2, for each possible trajectory zn of the particles one determines the potential
Aµ
zn(x) that minimizes the action I with respect to the variations of the potential alone: as
we have seen in the previous subsection, Aµ
zn(x) is just the potential that solves the Maxwell
equations for those particular particle trajectories. Then one can deﬁne the functional I ′ [zn]
of the trajectory of the particles alone, as

I ′ [zn]

≡

I

zn, Aµ
h

zn(x)

.

i

(3.20)

It is now possible to show that the condition δI ′ = 0, for arbitrary variations δzn(t) satisfying
δzn(t1) = δzn(t2) = 0, is equivalent to the fact that zn(t), together with Aµ
zn(x), are solutions
of Eq. (2.17). Of course, the minima of I must coincide with the minima of I ′: therefore the
trajectory of particles and ﬁelds
satisfying Eq. (2.17) is indeed the trajectory
that minimizes I within its whole deﬁnition domain, subject to the assigned boundary
o
conditions.

zn, Aµ
n

zn(x)

To prove that Eq. (2.17) actually follows from the condition δI ′ = 0, we start again by
calculating the variations of the non-renormalized action I(r) deﬁned according to Eq. (3.11).
We shall consider a single charged particle and drop the index n, since the generalization
of the results to an arbitrary number of particles is absolutely trivial. Furthermore we shall
write for simplicity Aµ instead of Aµ
z , although we shall always implicitly assume, keeping in
mind Eq. (3.20) and the previous considerations, that the ﬁeld satisﬁes Eq. (3.14). We can
therefore apply the previous formulae describing the asymptotic behavior of the ﬁeld near
the point charge. In addition, by diﬀerentiating Eq. (3.18) with respect to δz, δu, δ ˙u,. . ., it
is possible to expand the variation δA in a similar form:

δA(z + x) = (δA)

2(x) + (δA)

1(x) + (δA)0(x) + δ

A(z) + O(x).

As a function of x, (δA)j(x) is a homogeneous term of degree j which under the transfor-

-limit of the electromagnetic potential for the interaction part in Eq. (3.5). Clearly this
R
procedure has in principle nothing to do with the renormalization of the particle’s mass,
which is typical of other approaches to the argument, and in particular of the standard
renormalization techniques of quantum ﬁeld theories. Therefore our theory is free from
problems such as the appearance of an inﬁnitely negative “bare mass”, and from the diﬃculty
related to the impossibility of simultaneously compensating with such a mass term the non-

Clearly, one could interpret Eq. (3.41) as the lagrangian of a particle having indeed a di-
vergent negative bare mass m0 and carrying a total electric charge q that, for an observer
with the same instantaneous velocity of the particle, looks uniformly distributed over an
inﬁnitesimal spherical surface of radius r. We must however underline that Eq. (3.41) is
veriﬁed only when the ﬁelds are already solutions of Maxwell equations. In general, tak-
ing Eq. (3.41) as a deﬁnition would not be equivalent to the deﬁnition of L that we have
given in Eqs. (3.2)–(3.5). This is particularly important when introducing the hamiltonian
formalism, since Eq. (3.41) would give rise to divergent values for the conjugate momenta
pi = ∂L/∂vi, which is not the case in our theory, as we shall show in the next section.

IV. EULER-LAGRANGE AND HAMILTON EQUATIONS

It is useful to deﬁne the partial derivatives of the lagrangian L with respect to its ar-
guments, in such a way that the equations of motion can be formally derived as usual
Euler-Lagrange equations associated with L. We have seen in the previous section that, in
order to remain within the deﬁnition domain (that we shall call D0) of L, each variation
δz must be accompanied by a variation δA of the electromagnetic potential with an appro-
priate singular behavior near the particle. Therefore, deﬁning a partial derivative of the
type ∂L/∂zi for constant potential Aµ(x) requires introducing an extension of L outside its
original deﬁnition domain. We have to note ﬁrst of all that, inside D0, the particle’s position
z is univocally determined by the ﬁeld variables Aµ(x), since the potential is assumed to
be singular just in z. In other words, as soon as Aµ(x, t) is assigned for every x, also its
singular point, that will be now called w(t) to distinguish it in general from the particle’s
position z(t), is of course determined, and inside D0 it is always assumed that z = w. It
is clear now that, in order to treat z and Aµ(x) as really independent variables, we have to
deﬁne L also for z
= w. Having this in mind, the results of the previous section indicate
how to extend in an obvious way the deﬁnition of L. We shall put

∂zi = 0,
which is consistent with considering Lem as the purely electromagnetic part of the lagrangian,

above equations, the formal structure of Euler-Lagrange equations is directly recognizable.
The hamiltonian functional can be introduced via a Legendre transformation on L, as in

ordinary analytical mechanics. As usual, after imposing the Lorentz gauge condition

It is not surprising that, when point-like charged particles are present, also the above integral

is true for the integrals on the right-hand side of the Fourier expansions (5.1) when x takes
the value of the position zn(t) of one of the particles. We can however redeﬁne all these
integrals via a renormalization procedure which represents the equivalent in k space to that
introduced in Sec. II for the corresponding expressions in spatial coordinates.

because of the spatial antisymmetry of the integrand. It may be noted that Eqs. (5.28) and
(5.27) are respectively the reasons why there is not a term of order ln r on the right-hand

To complete the demonstration of the theorem, we are now going to prove Eq. (5.12).

C. Another remark on the renormalization of mass

We saw in Sec. II that the expression for the electromagnetic energy-momentum in x
space can be most conveniently handled when the cut-oﬀ regions in the integration domain
are taken as ellipsoids like in Eqs. (2.7) and (2.8). Similarly, in some cases the
-integral
in k space appearing in Eq. (5.13) may be more suitably expressed by choosing a diﬀerent
cut-oﬀ instead of the sphere of radius Λ introduced in Eq. (5.9). A particularly interesting
situation occurs when a single charged particle is present. In such a case, putting

R

aν(k, t)

aν(k, t)eik

z ,

28

, it can be easily seen that aν transforms as a four-vector, as it can already
with k0
be argued from the form of the right-hand sides of Eqs. (5.15) and (5.16). This suggests to
replace Eq. (5.24) with the following:

k

In fact, rewriting Eq. (5.32) as

(cid:16)

it can be seen immediately that also K ′
em(t, Λ) transforms as a four-vector. We observe that
the integration domain in Eq. (5.32) is characterized by the condition

with m0 = m
III C: when a proper cut-oﬀ is chosen, the method of the

that formally correspond to the introduction of an inﬁnite renormalization of the particle’s
mass. The analogy with the situation occurring with covariant regularization methods in
quantum ﬁeld theory is evident. It will be analyzed more closely in the following section.

VI. THE COMPARISON WITH QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS

In the previous sections of this paper we have provided a complete diverge-free formu-
lation of the classical electrodynamics of point charges. In the light of this result it is of
course extremely interesting to reconsider the problem of the relationship between classical
and quantum theories. It is in fact well known that the diﬃculties related to ultraviolet
divergences in quantum electrodynamics have been up to now circumvented only in the
framework of a perturbation expansion in the coupling constant α = e2/4π¯hc
1/137.
Finite non-perturbative expressions for the equations of motion or the hamiltonian operator
have not yet been established, and it is even doubtful that they actually exist within the
boundaries of pure electrodynamics. In connection with this problem, the implications of
our new way of formulating the classical theory can be directly investigated by making use
of the correspondence principle. Of course, in the quantum theory one encounters also the
class of divergences associated with vacuum polarization, that have no direct equivalent in
the classical theory. We shall not here take them into consideration, and we shall limit
our analysis to the simplest situation in which the analogy with the classical case can be
signiﬁcant, i.e. the electron self-energy to the lowest order in α. We shall assume that the
charged particles are represented by spin 1/2 fermions (electrons), and therefore described
as the quanta of a Dirac ﬁeld ψ. We shall follow the scheme of canonical quantization and,
by analogy with the classical Poisson brackets (4.15) and (4.18), we shall postulate the usual
fundamental equal-time commutation or anticommutation relations between ﬁeld operators.

where the subscript (0) indicates that the matrix element involves the non-interacting vac-

account. By analogy with Eq. (4.17) or (5.11), the interaction hamiltonian is obtained by
Aµ in place of Aµ into the familiar expression of the non-renormalized

gives rise to a contribution of order α ln Λ to the electron self-energy. This will force us to

an arbitrary parameter, the integrals can thus be easily evaluated. Then, by imposing the

B(2) + O (α2). One may observe that the arbitrary ﬁnite

allows for a ﬁnite renormalization of the theory, once the ultraviolet divergences have been

Of course, in order to really establish on a ﬁrm basis the correspondence between classical
and quantum electrodynamics, one should be able to obtain such a result to any order in
perturbation theory. However, an important diﬀerence between the two theories is given by
the fact that in the quantum case the full electron self-energy contains an inﬁnite number
of contributions of any order in α. When a manifestly covariant cut-oﬀ Λ is used (as in the
Pauli-Villars regularization scheme) the contribution of order αn contains powers of ln (Λ/m)
up to lnn (Λ/m). Therefore the simple logaritmic dependence which we have found for the
lowest-order contribution in Eq. (6.5) cannot be assumed to represent the behavior of the
exact electron self-energy as a function of Λ. We have just seen how the form of this behavior
(which in turn is strictly related to the large momentum behavior of the renormalized self-
energy) aﬀects the correct deﬁnition of the
-limits that may appear in the equations
of motion and the hamiltonian operator of QED. These considerations therefore seem to
indicate that the problem of explicitly providing a ﬁnite and non-perturbative mathematical
formulation of quantum electrodynamics is in any case ultimately related to the investigation
of the short-distance behavior of the theory.

APPENDIX A: ASYMPTOTIC EXPANSION OF THE FIELD NEAR A POINT
CHARGE

We want to construct a covariant asymptotic expansion for the retarded and advanced
electromagnetic potentials near a point z(τ ) of the wold-line of a particle with proper time
τ . Such an expansion will have the form

Clearly, the following two requirements must be satisﬁed:

1. When ﬁxing x

z + x, since the left-hand side of Eq. (A1) becomes of course indepen-
dent of τ , the series on the right-hand side must as a whole have the same property.

≡

2. For x2 = xνxν = 0 and x0 < 0 (resp. x0 > 0), the well-known expression of the

Li´enard-Wiechert advanced (resp. retarded) potentials must be obtained:

Conversely, it is easy to see that if we manage to obtain a series satisfying the require-

obeying the equation of motion (2.17). Then, by decomposing V as the union of a due
number of subsets each containing a single particle, and then applying to each of them the
equation (C13), it is immediate to prove that Eq. (2.14) is satisﬁed.

APPENDIX D: PROOF OF THEOREM 2

1. The one-particle case

Let us consider a tube T of arbitrary shape in four-dimensional space-time, containing
the world-line of a single particle of charge q. Let us suppose also that a given point P (τ)
of this world-line, corresponding to a value τ of the proper time, is assigned the coordinates
µ = 0 in two inertial reference frames O and O′. We shall deﬁne π and π′ as the
zµ = z′
three-dimensional spaces characterized by the equations x0 = 0 and x′
0 = 0 respectively.
Clearly both spaces intersect the world-line at the point P (τ ). Let us also deﬁne the vector

where b is an arbitrary constant four-vector. From the local conservation of the electromag-
netic energy-momentum tensor T µν, it follows immediately that ∂µJ µ = 0 everywhere in
the tube T except on the particle’s world-line. For r much smaller than the diameter of the
tube T , we have via a by-parts integration

If a single charged particle is present in the whole space, one can consider the limit of
Eq. (D10) when the spatial dimensions of the tube T tend to inﬁnity. Assuming as usual
that T µν vanishes suﬃciently fast at inﬁnity, the integral over ∂T on the right-hand side will
vanish, so that Eq. (D10) becomes

Since b was arbitrarily chosen, the above equation implies that P ν
em transforms as a four-
vector. One may notice that the particle’s equation of motion has not been used up to now
in this section. This means that, in the one-particle case, the Lorentz covariance of the
electromagnetic energy-momentum four-vector deﬁned by Eq. (2.19) is a consequence of the
Maxwell equations alone, and is veriﬁed at any point of the world-line of the particle for any
arbitrary particle trajectory.

We would like to point out that Eq. (D10) holds also in the more general case when
= 0.
0 = 0, this means

in place of O one considers another arbitrary system of reference O′′ for which v′′(τ )

Then subtracting this equation from Eq. (D10) directly yields Eq. (D12), as it is easy to
check. We are going to make use of Eq. (D12) for the analysis of the many-particle case in
the following subsection.

2. The many-particle case

Let us now assume that N particles are present, with N > 1. One can prove that also
in this case the total energy-momentum of the system, deﬁned according to Eq. (2.18),
transforms as a four-vector when particles and ﬁelds satisfy the equations of motion (2.17)
and (2.21)–(2.24). To show this, let us divide the whole space-time into N tubes T1, T2,. . .,TN
each containing the world-line of a single particle (clearly some tubes will extend spatially to
inﬁnity). Given two arbitrary inertial frames O and O′, the spaces π and π′ (again identiﬁed
by the equations x0 = 0 and x′
0 = 0 respectively) will intersect the world-line of the generic
n-th particle at two distinct points corresponding to the values τ and τ ′ of the proper time.
Calling x0
x0(τ ′), we introduce also the space π characterized by the equation x0 = x0.
Repeating the same arguments of App. C we can write

(note that the expression in square brackets on the right-hand side is written in such a way
that the above formula holds in both the cases x0 > 0 and x0 < 0). Besides, rewriting Eq.
(D12) for the n-th particle at the proper time τ ′, we have

where the total momenta P ν and P ′
ν are deﬁned according to Eq. (2.18) in the two reference

the Lorentz covariance of the total energy-momentum four-vector.

where the last equality follows again from Eq. (E4). Therefore P 0 is equal to the total energy
that was introduced in Sec. II. In the form given by Eqs. (E2) and (E5), the four-vector P µ
can also be immediately identiﬁed with the canonical energy-momentum deﬁned in Sec. IV.
The derivation of the conservation laws carried out in the present section clearly represents
a generalization of Noether’s theorem applied to the lagrangian deﬁned by Eqs. (3.2)–(3.5).

mation. However, one can obtain Eqs. (5.14)–(5.16) in a shorter way by considering, for a

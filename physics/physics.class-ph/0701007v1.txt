Abstract

In this paper we express the retarded ﬁelds of Maxwell’s theory in terms of the instantaneous

ﬁelds of a Galilei-invariant electromagnetic and we ﬁnd the vector function χL whose spatial and

temporal derivatives transform the instantaneous ﬁelds into the retarded ones. We conclude that

the instantaneous ﬁelds can formally be introduced as unphysical objects into classical electrody-

namics which can be used to ﬁnd the physical retarded ﬁelds

The possible coexistence of both instantaneous and retarded electromagnetic interactions

has recently been discussed [1-5]. The idea of this coexistence is partially motivated by the

striking result that the scalar potential in the Coulomb gauge is an instantaneous quantity.

This result was discussed some years ago by Brill and Goodman [6] and by Gardiner and

Drummond [7] and more recently by Rohrlich [8], Jackson [9] and the author [10]. The

conclusion has been reiterative: the retarded ﬁelds derived from the Lorenz-gauge poten-

tials are the same retarded ﬁelds obtained from the Coulomb-gauge potentials, despite the

instantaneous character of the Coulomb-gauge scalar potential. The electromagnetic theory

is complete as usually expressed [5] and there is no necessity of introducing instantaneous

ﬁelds into this classical theory. The physical ﬁelds are always retarded, except in the strict

static limit.

However, there is a formal connection between instantaneous and retarded ﬁelds which

is certainly unavoidable. The argument is as follows. Given a conﬁned source f (x, t) we

can always construct simultaneously (i) a retarded ﬁeld F(x, t) satisfying the wave equation:
(cid:3)2F(x, t) = f (x, t) where (cid:3)2 ≡ ∇2 − (1/c2)∂2/∂t2 and (ii) an instantaneous ﬁeld
satisfying the Poisson equation: ∇2
vanish at inﬁnity. The implied equality (cid:3)2F = ∇2

F originates in turn a deﬁned relation

F(x, t) = f (x, t). The ﬁelds F and

F are assumed to

F(x, t)

e

e

e

between the ﬁelds F and

F by means of which we can always construct one of them by

e
F and solve (cid:3)2F = ∇2

F then we obtain

specifying the other one. In particular, if we specify

e

the solution F = g(

F) which expresses F in terms of
e

F. Regardless if

F is a physical ﬁeld

e

or not, it can be used to generate F. It is pertinent to emphasize that the result that F can

e

e

e

be expressed in terms of

F is similar to the well-known result that a retarded ﬁeld can be

expressed in terms of its associated (unphysical) potential. The above argument naturally

e

applies to electromagnetism because the retarded electric and magnetic ﬁelds satisfy wave

equations with conﬁned sources and therefore the formal existence of instantaneous electric

and magnetic ﬁelds is actually implied.

In this paper we show how instantaneous electromagnetic ﬁelds can be introduced as

unphysical objects into classical electrodynamics. Speciﬁcally, we obtain the retarded ﬁelds

of Maxwell’s theory in terms of the instantaneous ﬁelds of a Galilei-invariant electromagnetic

theory [11,12] and we ﬁnd the speciﬁc vector function that transforms the instantaneous

ﬁelds into the retarded ones.

Let us specify what we understand for instantaneous electric and magnetic ﬁelds from a

2

formal point of view. Such ﬁelds are governed by the ﬁeld equations [11,12]:

where

E and

B are the instantaneous electric and magnetic ﬁelds produced by the charge

and current densities, ρ and J. Equations (1) are consistent with the continuity equation

e

e

and are exactly invariant under Galilei transformations [11,12]. Clearly, eqs. (1) are funda-

mentally diﬀerent from Maxwell’s equations because of the absence of Faraday’s induction

term [+(1/c) ∂

B/∂t] in the left-hand side of Eq. (1c). Of course, this does not mean that

∂

B/∂t = 0. Time-dependence of the ﬁelds

E and

B is arbitrary because of the assumed

e

arbitrariness of ρ and J. Accordingly, eqs. (1) are not considered here as a limit case of
e

e

e

Maxwell’s equations [11].

Because the ﬁelds

E and

B clearly violate the principle of causality we consider them

only as mathematical objects lacking of physical meaning. Therefore, eqs. (1) determine

e

e

the unobservable ﬁelds

E and

B in terms of the observable sources ρ and J. The expected

relation between instantaneous and retarded ﬁelds relies on a formal result according to

e

e

which if we specify the conﬁned sources ρ and J then we can always construct simultaneously

(i) retarded electric and magnetic ﬁelds satisfying Maxwell’s equations and (ii) instantaneous

electric and magnetic ﬁelds satisfying eqs. (1).

From eqs. (1) we derive the Poisson equations:

We consider now the following theorem: If f (x, t) and h(x, t) represent the conﬁned
sources of the retarded ﬁeld F(x, t), i.e., (cid:3)2F(x, t) = f (x, t) + h(x, t) and if f (x, t) is also

the source of the instantaneous ﬁeld

F(x, t), i.e., ∇2

F(x, t) = f (x, t) then F can be obtained

from

From eqs. (2a) and (8a) we obtain (cid:3)2E = ∇2

Clearly, eqs.

(15) mix ﬁelds having diﬀerent symmetries: E and B belong to a Lorenz-

invariant theory while

E and

B belong to a Galilei-invariant theory. Given the charge and

current densities we can obtain the instantaneous electric and magnetic ﬁelds [via eqs. (3)]

e

e

and hence the retarded electric and magnetic ﬁelds [via eqs. (15)]:

{ρ, J} → {

E,

B} → {E, B}.

(16)

e
Apparently, the instantaneous ﬁelds play a similar paper to that of potentials: {ρ, J} →

e

{Φ, A} → {E, B}. However, the calculation of potentials is more complicated than that of

instantaneous ﬁelds because of the latter do not involve retardation. Moreover, the potentials

are gauge-dependent while the instantaneous ﬁelds are gauge-invariant.

We can also relate the Lorentz-gauge instantaneous potentials

ΦL and

AL to the Lorentz-

gauge retarded potentials ΦL and AL. From eqs. (6) and (12) we get (cid:3)2ΦL = ∇2
(cid:3)2AL = ∇2

According to eqs. (18), the time derivative of the functions χL and χL transform the instan-

taneous potentials into the retarded potentials. Moreover, the deﬁnition of the functions χL

(25a)

The integration term χ0 is a priori a function of x but not of t. Actually, χ0 is shown to be

a constant if we demand ﬁniteness at inﬁnity [9].

Following the same procedure leading to eq. (25a), we use eqs. (5a) and (11a) into eq.

(18a) to get the analogous expression for χL:

χL(x, t) =

R/c

dτ ρ(x′, t − τ ) + χ0.

(25b)

where χ0 is a constant. Therefore, eqs.

(19) involving eﬀectively two three-dimensional

spatial integrals have been transformed into eqs. (25) which involve one three-dimensional

spatial integral and one time integral replacing the spatial nonlocality of the respective

source with a temporal nonlocality. Equations (25) are easier of manipulating than eqs.

(19).

The negative of eq. (25b) is essentially the gauge function χC that transforms the Lorenz

potentials ΦL and AL into the Coulomb potentials ΦC and AC [9] and therefore χL is essen-

tially the gauge function that transforms the Coulomb potentials into the Lorenz potentials:

ΦL = ΦC −

This means that eqs. (18) and (26) are necessarily related. In fact, from eq. (5a) we conclude

that

ΦL = ΦC and consequently eqs. (18a) and (26a) are shown to be identical.

Insertion of eqs. (18) into eqs. (10) and the use of eqs. (21) and (20b) lead to

e

These relations are the main result of this paper. They agree with the implications {ρ, J} →

{

E,

B, χL} → {E, B}. This means that χL is the function whose spatial and temporal

derivatives transform the instantaneous ﬁelds into the retarded ones. Of course, we can

e

e

directly verify that eqs. (27) satisfy Maxwell’s equations.

Equations (18) and (27) illustrate the idea that potentials and ﬁelds of the Galilei-

invariant electromagnetic theory can be introduced as formal (unphysical) objects into classi-

cal electrodynamics. Interestingly, when the functions χL and χL are separately considered,

the former transforms ﬁelds of diﬀerent theories [eqs.

(27)] while the latter transforms

potentials (in diﬀerent gauges) of a same theory [eqs. (26)].

On the other hand, using eqs. (18b), (20b) and (21) we can write eq. (27a) as

which combines with eq. (26b) to give

This relation has recently been veriﬁed by Jackson [9] using a novel form of the Coulomb-

gauge potential AC.

In conclusion, in this paper we have obtained the retarded ﬁelds of Maxwell’s theory

in terms of the instantaneous ﬁelds of a Galilei-invariant electromagnetic theory. We have

derived the speciﬁc function χL whose spatial and temporal derivatives transform the instan-
taneous ﬁelds into the retarded ones. We have concluded that the instantaneous ﬁelds can

formally be introduced as unphysical objects into electrodynamics which can alternatively

be used to obtain the physical retarded ﬁelds.

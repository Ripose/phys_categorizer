1. – Introduction

It is well-known that Maxwell equations have been shown to admit of wavelet-type so-

lutions endowed with arbitrary[1] group-velocities 0 < vg <
rigidly moving and have been called “localized solutions”, attracted large attention[2]. In

particular, much work has been done with regard to the Superluminal localized solutions

(SLS), the most interesting of which —as predicted by Special Relativity (SR) itself[3]—

resulted to be the “X-shaped” ones[4]. Such X-shaped SLSs have been actually produced

in a number of experiments[5].

The theory of SR, when based on the ordinary postulates but not restricted to sub-

luminal waves and objects, i.e., in its extended version[6], predicts the simplest X-shaped
wave to be the one corresponding to the electromagnetic ﬁeld created by a Superluminal∗
charge[8]. It is of the utmost importance evaluating the ﬁeld associated with a Superlumi-
nal electric charge†, not only as a contribution to the theory of X-shaped waves, but also
as a starting point for predicting the electromagnetic interaction of a charged “tachyon”

with ordinary matter (and planning, maybe, the construction of a suitable detector).

2. – The toy-model of a pointlike Superluminal charge

Let us ﬁrst start by considering, formally, a pointlike Superluminal charge, even if

the hypothesis of pointlikeness (already unacceptable in the subluminal case) is totally

inadequate in the Superluminal case, as it was thoroughly shown in refs.[8].

Then, let us consider the ordinary vector-potential Aµ and a current desity jµ
≡
(0, 0, jz; jo) ﬂowing in the z-direction. On assuming the ﬁelds to be generated by the
sources only, one has that Aµ
(0, 0, Az; φ), which, when adopting the Lorentz gauge,
obeys the equation ✷Aµ = jµ. Such non-homogeneous wave equation, in cylindrical co-
ordinates (ρ, θ, z; t) and for axial symmetry [which requires a priori that Aµ = Aµ(ρ, z; t)],

≡

∗Incidentally, let us recall that the luminal case was successfully examined by Bonnor[7], who showed
the Maxwell equations to admit of ﬁnite-energy solutions even in the limiting case of a (mass-free)
“particle” carrying equal amounts of positive and negative electric charge.

†For simplicity, we are here adopting the standard language, but it should be recalled that we must
rather think in terms of an “electromagnetic charge”, which behaves as an electric charge when subluminal
and as a magnetic pole when Superluminal: cf. refs.[9].

Let us now suppose Aµ to be actually independent of η, namely, Aµ = Aµ(ρ, ζ). Due
to eq.(3), we shall have jµ = jµ(ρ, ζ) too; and therefore jz = V j0 (from the continuity
equation), and Az = V φ/c (from the Lorentz gauge). Then, by calling

One can notice that the procedure leading to eqs.(4) constitutes a simple generalization of

Lu et al.’s theorem[12] for non-homogeneous equations, i.e., for the case with sources.[13]

As announced above, let us ﬁnally analyse the possibility and consequences of having a

after some calculations, into

In the second one of eqs.(11) it enters expression (12) with the spectral parameter[11]

a = 0, which indeed corresponds to the non-homogeneous case [the fact that for a = 0

these equations diﬀer for an imaginary unit will be discussed elsewhere].

It is quite important, at this point, to notice that such a solution, (11), represents a

wave existing only inside the (unlimited) double cone

generated by the rotation around

the z-axis of the straight lines ρ =

γζ: This is in full agreement with the predictions[15]

of the “extended” theory of Special Relativity[6].

One meets therefore a ﬁeld discontinuity when crossing the double-cone surface, since

the ﬁeld is zero outside it. Nevertheless, the boundary conditions imposed by Maxwell

equations[15] are satisﬁed by our solution (11), or (13-15), since at each point of the cone

surface the electric and the magnetic ﬁeld are both tangent to the cone: We shall discuss

this point below.

Here, let us emphasize that, when V

0, the electric ﬁeld tend to vanish,

In the present note we can only mention such a

circumstance, and refer to refs.[3,9]: Where it is shown that, if one calls electric the

“electromagnetic charge” when it is subluminal, then he should call it magnetic when
Superluminalk (cf. Fig.46 at page 155 of the ﬁrst one of refs.[6]). Actually, result (11) can
be obtained in a quicker way just by applying a Superluminal Lorentz “transformation”[6]

to the ﬁelds generated by a subluminal (in particular, at rest) electric point-charge.

Let us add, more in general, that —as mentioned at the end of the previous Section—

extended relativity predicts, e.g., that the spherical equipotential surfaces of the elec-

trostatic ﬁeld created by a charge at rest get transformed (by a Superluminal Lorentz

“transformation”) into two-sheeted rotation-hyperboloids, contained inside an unlimited

double-cone[6,8]: see Fig.5. One ought to notice, incidentally, that this double cone does

not have much to do with the Cherenkov cone. In fact the double cone is associated with

a constant-speed Superluminal charge even in the vacuum, while Cherenkov radiation

emission is induced by a fast electric charge only out of a material medium. Moreover

(cf. also Fig.27 at page 80 of the ﬁrst one of refs.[6]) a Superluminal charge traveling at

constant speed, in the vacuum, e.g., does not lose energy[8].

We go eventually back to the problem that one meets a ﬁeld discontinuity across

the double-cone surface [see eqs.(13-15) and eqs.(16)], since the ﬁeld is zero outside

the ﬁelds (13)-(15) even diverge. Nevertheless, one can straightforwardly verify

kWe have shown elsewhere[16,9] that a Superluminal charge e and a Superluminal current jµ are a
pseudoscalar and a pseudovector, respectively:
like in the case of a magnetic charge and a magnetic
current; so that they should rather be written as γ5e and γ5jµ. But in this preliminary note we shall
forget about the symmetry properties of those quantities.

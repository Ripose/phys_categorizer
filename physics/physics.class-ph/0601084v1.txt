Abstract

In this work we made an analysis of the current status of velocity dependent
(bound) ﬁeld components in the framework of the standard electromagnetic theory.
Preliminary discussions of the structure of the magnetic ﬁeld due to an idealized
oscillating magnetic dipole provided us with the quantitative insights on the relative
contribution of velocity dependent (bound) and acceleration dependent (radiation)
terms into the resultant magnetic ﬁeld. According to this analysis we deﬁned the
methodological scheme based on a generalized (time-dependent) Biot-Savart law ca-
pable to test the applicability of the standard retardation condition on bound ﬁeld
components. In the second part of this work we made the theoretical analysis of
the ﬁnite size multi-section antennas, conﬁrming the validity of the methodological
scheme conceived for an idealized magnetic dipole. The use of multi-section an-
tennas is fully justiﬁed by a substantial rise of the ratio of bound-to-radiation ﬁeld
strength. Finally, we eﬀected numerical calculations taking into account particu-
lar experimental settings and compared them with experimentally obtained data
that unambiguously indicate on the non-applicability of the standard retardation
condition to bound magnetic ﬁelds. In addition, experimental observations show a
striking coincidence with the predictions of a new generalized Biot-Savart law which
implies the spreading velocity of bound ﬁelds highly exceeding the velocity of light.

1 Introduction

Nowadays, the standard classical electrodynamics is perceived as the paradigm of a
causal and deterministic classical ﬁeld theory. The most general approach to the cal-
culation of electric and magnetic ﬁelds is explicable in terms of the so-called Lienard-
Wiechert potentials. Their conventional form in the case of an arbitrary moving classical
point charge of magnitude q is given as[1]−[2]:

where the corresponding quantity in brackets means that it is evaluated at the retarded
time t′ = t
R/c; R is the distance from the retarded position of the charge to the point
of observation and u is a velocity of a charge at the instant of time t′.

As our intention to make clear the main proposals of this work, we ﬁrst discuss
the fundamental underlying structure of existing solutions. Electric and magnetic ﬁeld
values E and B are related to potentials (1) by the equations:

Both electric E and magnetic B ﬁelds are composed of two essentially diﬀerent parts:

E = Eu + Ea;

where Bu = n

×

The ﬁrst terms Eu and Bu are usually regarded as velocity ﬁelds because they are
independent of acceleration ˙u. The electric velocity ﬁeld Eu falls oﬀ as R−2 that is
the substantial feature of the radial (longitudinal) ﬁeld components associated with the
static Coulomb law. By this reason the velocity ﬁelds are also referred as bound or
longitudinal ﬁelds. On the contrary, the second parts of solutions (3)-(4), denoted as Ea
and Ba are linear functions of acceleration, falling oﬀ proportional to R−1. These terms
are responsible for the radiation and take no place in the case of uniformly moving
charge (as well as at rest), giving priority to bound components in the formation of
electromagnetic (EM) ﬁeld. The latter fact poses a question of considerable fundamental
interest concerning the nature and physical characteristics on bound ﬁelds. It implies a
fundamental question of whether the applicability of the standard retardation condition
to all components of electromagnetic ﬁeld has solid theoretical, methodological and

empirical grounds. Put in other terms, should be there an explicit empirical test of the
applicability of the retardation condition to bound ﬁeld components?

Doubts about the soundness of the conventional treatment of bound ﬁelds appear
already when one studies the transition between the initial state of rest (or uniform mo-
tion) and the subsequent state of acceleration of the charge. The origin of this important
insight resides in the belief that a fully consistent approach to classical electrodynamics
demands the continuity of electromagnetic phenomena in all situations. This allow-
able inference was recently explored in[3]. The mathematical analysis of boundary-value
problems for D’Alembert and Poisson’s equations showed that the present set of solu-
tions to Maxwell’s equations does not ensure the continuity in transition between, on
one hand, the general case of an arbitrary moving charge and, on the other hand, the
static or quasi-static (uniform motion) limits. Independent approach implemented in[4]
also unambiguously indicates that the transition between two diﬀerent states of uni-
form velocity of a charge via an intermediate state of acceleration results in a type of
discontinuity in functional form.

The peculiar historical background of the classical EM theory gives an additional
motivation to focus our attention on bound ﬁelds. The problem of propagation of EM
interactions was the crucial point in choosing appropriate theoretical foundations for
classical electrodynamics in the 19th century. By the time Hertz began his experiments
in providing evidence in favor of EM waves in air, the set of fundamental solutions to
Maxwell’s equations did not imply any explicit separation into bound and radiation ﬁeld
components. Only Lorentz’s modiﬁcation of Maxwell’s theory (1892) provided Lienard
(1898) and Wiechert (1901) with inhomogeneous wave equations. The retarded solutions
were found under the retardation constraint which, as it is generally accepted, was just
experimentally veriﬁed by Hertz in 1888[5]. It gave a rise to the fact that bound and
radiation ﬁeld components of Lienard-Wiechert solutions propagate at the same rate.

Thus, in light of our discussion we can see that Hertz’s experiments were not es-
pecially thought-out to bring solid empirical grounds on the physical characteristics of
bound ﬁelds as well as to test the applicability of the retardation constraint on them.
In modern retrospective, this uncertainty in respect to bound components might imply
some sort of methodological incompleteness in Hertz’s experimental approach as it has
been recently inferred in[6] and, therefore, any attempt to provide a fuller experimental
information on bound ﬁelds acquires a fundamental importance in the framework of
the classical EM theory. As response to these conceptual questions, in this work we
propose an experimental approach to velocity (bound) ﬁelds to test the applicability of
the standard retardation constraint to bound ﬁeld components.

Recently, Hertz’s-type experiment has already been attempted[7] in order to remove
above-mentioned uncertainties in respect to electric bound ﬁeld components. However,
no explicit information was obtained as regards to the nature of electric bound ﬁelds
and the front of the detected signal apparently propagated at the light velocity as it
is assumed in the standard EM theory. However, the subsequent analysis showed that
there was no preliminary theoretical estimation of the relative contribution of bound
and radiation components into the ﬁnal signal. This estimation is crucial if one takes
into account that EM radiation terms fall oﬀ as R−1 and at large distances predominate,

3

determining the time shift of the signal front measured by oscilloscope. Additionally,
the chosen spheroid shape of the receiving antenna used in experimental measurements
made it especially unsensitive to the direction of the propagating electric ﬁeld.

There is also another experimental diﬃculty connected to the estimation of the
relative contribution of bound components when the radiation is very intensive, i.e.
for frequencies ω > 108 s−1. In fact, the intensity of EM radiation rapidly increases
with ω, hence hindering the sensitivity of measuring devices in respect to bound ﬁelds
that fall oﬀ as R−2. Contrarily, for the low frequency radiation the time resolution
of registration systems decreases considerably and results insuﬃcient to measure any
EM signal with due precision. Without such preliminary discussion and analysis, the
experimental approach eﬀected in[7] looks rather unreliable. Put in other terms, one
can not avoid the preliminary calculation of an optimal range of variations of R and ω
in which the experimental treatment of bound ﬁelds might be attended with expected
precision.

In addition to the feebleness of the eﬀects produces by bound ﬁelds that fall oﬀ
as R−2, there are also several technical circumstances that make direct observation of
bound ﬁelds an extremely diﬃcult task. All known radiation devices (antennas etc) are
designed to enhance the radiation to the utmost, i.e. to reach the maximum value of the
ratio of radiation-to-bound ﬁeld strength. In other words, the use of radiation devices
in their traditional form can be rather counterproductive and, therefore, there should
be a radically diﬀerent experimental approach based on a substantial rise of the ratio of
bound-to-radiation ﬁeld strength.

As follows, we shall present an experimental scheme that is methodologically con-
ceived to surmount all above-mentioned technical diﬃculties and to provide unambigu-
ous explicit information on bound magnetic components. The main idea of our method
is based on the analysis of EM ﬁeld in the plane of the loop antenna with oscillating cur-
rent. Section 2 is devoted to the underlying idea of how the spreading velocity of bound
magnetic ﬁelds can be measured in an idealized case.
In Section 3 a methodological
approach will be described in more details as concerns a particular experimental set-up
(described in Section 4) which implements multi-section type of antennas in order to
increase the ratio of bound-to-radiation ﬁeld strenght. Finally, Section 5 presents results
of numerical calculations and their comparison with experimental data.

dipole: introduction into methodology of experimental
approach

This Section will be devoted to the illustration of the background of the consistent
methodological approach to empirical identiﬁcation of bound magnetic ﬁelds. By anal-
ogy with the retarded vector potential A, the magnetic ﬁeld B can be determined

In the low velocity relativistic limit (i.e. when the velocity of charges is much lower
than c but the eﬀect of retardation is still taken into account)[8]−[9], the general solution
(6) can be presented in an equivalent form of the line integral as the generalized (time-

The generalized (time-dependent) Eq. (8) is exact when the centripetal acceleration
of the moving charges is ignored (low velocity approximation) and, as it is demonstrated
in[9], can be derived directly, starting with (1) for retarded potentials ϕ and A. As a
consequence, the Eq. (8) has a general applicability to usual electric circuits since the
velocity of conduction electrons is always much lower than c. The ﬁrst term on the right
hand side of expression (8) is the classical integral form of the Biot-Savart law when the

current I in the circuit Γ is steady (i.e.

h

˙I

The velocity dependent (bound) component Bu arises from the term proportional to
[I] whereas the acceleration ﬁeld Ba is due to the
term. Traditionally, in the general
(time-dependent) case solutions to corresponding D’Alembert equations are found under
the retardation constraint applied to the whole electromagnetic ﬁeld, hence providing the
same spreading velocity to bound and radiation ﬁelds as it takes place in the standard Eq.
(8). In view of overwhelming empirical evidences that radiation components propagate
at the velocity of light c, we keep the standard retardation constraint unmodiﬁed in
respect to acceleration ﬁelds Ba. Contrarily, we assume that there is no explicit empirical
evidence on the way how bound ﬁelds propagate in empty space. Using the underlying
structure of the Eq. (8), we are now in a position to deal with bound and acceleration
ﬁelds separately and to explore a wide range of hypothetic retardation constraints in
respect to bound components, i.e. the situation when the spreading velocity of bound
ﬁelds Bu, denoted as v, varies continuously in the range v
c. In the context of this

The introduction of the dissimilar approaches to the treatment of bound and radia-
tion ﬁelds adds to the diﬃculty of its justiﬁcation in the framework of the conventional
classical electrodynamics. The theoretical exploration of this case will conceivably im-
ply the extension of foundations and perhaps the rise of new concepts. One possible
justiﬁcation might be based on the use of a two-parameter Lorentz-like gauge (so-called
v-gauge)[10] which leaves original Maxwell’s equations unmodiﬁed and introduces an
arbitrary propagational velocity v
c for scalar components of electric ﬁeld (i.e. they
can be identiﬁed with bound ﬁelds). Recently, v-gauge approach is widely discussed as a
possible explanation of apparently superluminal group velocity of evanescent waves[11].
Even though the foundations of the hypothetic distinction of propagational velocities of
bound and radiation components remain at present stage unclear, the use of Eq. (9)
allows us to conceive a general methodological scheme capable to test the applicability
of the standard retardation constraint to bound ﬁelds, i.e. the case v = c. Certainly,
any discrepancy between experimental observations and theoretical predictions based on
the condition v = c would not automatically imply the correctness of our hypothesis in
form of the Eq. (9) but rather no applicability of the standard retardation constraint to
bound ﬁelds. In the latter case v
= c, the Eq. (9) can be taken as a ﬁrst approximation
to make theoretical predictions that can be veriﬁed by experiment.

≥

For further convenience, let us resort to a certain idealization in our attempt to
use the basic equation (9) in a less cumbersome representation, keeping untouched all
fundamental features related to the bound and radiation components. By these reasons,
we ﬁrst consider an example of idealized oscillating magnetic dipole given in form of a
loop antenna with the radius r. It will be assumed that the magnetic dipole moment m
varies harmonically with time at the angular frequency ω. Then the idealization implies
two requirements: (a) the radius of the loop r is considerably smaller than the distance
R from the center of the antenna to the point of observation; (b) the wavelength λ of
1
emitted EM radiation greatly exceeds the perimeter of the loop, i.e. r
ω . The second
requirement means that at a given frequency ω the magnitude of conduction current has
nearly the same value I in all parts of the loop circuit at a present instant of time t. This
condition, which is usually regarded as an approximation of quasi-stationary current,
gives a simple relationship m = ∆SI(t)z between the magnetic dipole moment m and
the conduction current value I(t), where ∆S is the area bounded by the loop and z is the
unit vector perpendicular to the plane of the loop. Notice also that the quasi-stationary
c,
current approximation remains valid for bound components in the whole range v
i.e. r

The ﬁrst and the second terms in rhs of Eq. (10) have the common origin and arise
from the bound component Bu. The contribution proportional to R−3 is a dynamic
counterpart of a steady magnetic ﬁeld produced by a static magnetic dipole of magnitude
m. The R−2-term is due to a ﬁnite size of the antenna loop which stipulates the diﬀerence
in the value of retarded time t′ = t
R/v for EM signals out-coming from diﬀerent
segments of the perimeter of EA. In other words, a bound ﬁeld perturbation emitted from
the nearest half-part of the loop arrives at the point of observation before an equivalent
signal from the farthest half-part. This retarded time shift leads to the contribution
proportional to ˙I or ˙m (for a more detailed explanation, see Appendix). The last R−1-
term is submitted to the standard retardation constraint v = c and corresponds to the
magnetic dipole radiation which falls oﬀ as R−1.

Let us now take into consideration a receiving loop antenna (RA) under the set of
approximations assumed earlier for the EA. Let us place both EA and RA loops in the
same plane xy as it is shown in Fig.1. The origin of the coordinate frame coincides with
the center of the EA loop and R denotes the position-vector of the center of the RA
loop. The generation of an electromotive force (e.m.f.) ε(t) is proportional to the time

In this hypothetic
case, there is no retardation for bound ﬁelds and at the point of observation every

equivalent signal from the farthest half-part. Therefore, the in-plane geometry shown
in Fig.1 should be sensitive to any variation of the parameter v, since it directly aﬀects
the value of the second R−2-term.

This fundamental feature allows us to formulate a methodology of a consistent ex-
perimental approach to bound magnetic components. Obviously, as it has already been
inferred in the Introduction, any practical realization of the above-considered scheme
may be accompanied by a number of rather delicate technical diﬃculties. So, in our ap-
proach to idealization of experimental conditions, let us ﬁrst assume that the current I(t)
in the EA oscillates harmonically at the angular frequency ω as I(t) =
I(0) cos(ωt).
Then, an observer can measure the phase of the e.m.f. εv(t) induced in the RA and
compare it with the phase of some reference harmonic signal εr. In the following, we
shall show how it can be implemented.

The ﬁrst subplot in Fig.2 shows the comparison between the signal εv=c(t) induced
in the RA and the reference signal εr(t), according to their evolution with R and t.
In the second subplot of Fig.2 we specify relative contributions of R−3, R−2 and R−1-
terms and their mutual harmonic phase shifts. It explains why εv=c(t) and εr(t) are
not synchronized, i.e. there is always a ﬁnite time shift ∆t between instants when both
signals εv=c(t) and εr(t) cross a zero line. However, at large distances the radiation
R−1-term predominates considerably so that R−3, R−2-terms can be referred only as
weak perturbations of the dominant R−1-component. In other words, the signal εv=c(t)
tends to take the harmonic form proportional to η2 sin(ωt
η), hence forcing the time
shift ∆t to vanish at large distances (far ﬁeld zone).

−

∞

The same analysis is also applicable in the general case for the whole range of varia-
c. In Fig.3 we show diagrams that correspond to the
tions of the parameter v, i.e. v
≥
second hypothetic limit (v =
). At short distances, there is also clearly visible ﬁnite
time shift ∆t when both signals εv=∞(t) and εr(t) cross a zero line. We remind here
that in this limit case the contribution proportional to R−2 disappears so that only R−3
and R−1-terms can be seen in the second sub-diagram of Fig.3. Moreover, if at distances
R > c/ω the ﬁrst R−3-term results already negligible in comparison with R−1-term (it
will be fulﬁlled in our experimental conditions) the variation of the time shift ∆t(R)
does not exhibit any oscillations as it is shown in Fig.4. We have thus reached the
conclusion that the type of variation of ∆t(R) is very sensitive to the particular value of
the parameter v and hence can be subjected to the empirical test. Further on we shall
refer this approach as a zero crossing method.

Summarizing the discussion of idealized antennas, we would like to emphasize that
the requirements imposed by this approximation are hardly available in real experimental
practice. On the one hand, the value of the e.m.f. ε depends essentially on the radius
r4. On the other hand,
r of the loop antenna because it is proportional to (∆S)2
in order to reach the criteria of the quasi-stationary current approximation, one cannot
decrease the radius r without moderation, since the precision of measurements critically
depends on the intensity of EA and RA signals. Therefore, there should be a balance
between mutually excluding requirements. In our attempt to reduce dependence on the
radius of the loop r, we resorted to the help of so-called multi-section antennas. As we
will show in the next Section, the approximation of quasi-stationary current and the
maximum ratio of bound-to-radiation ﬁeld strength can be easily implemented for ﬁnite
size multi-section antennas (even in the range of high frequencies ω), keeping valid the
approach based on the zero crossing method.

∼

3 Methodology of experiment in the case of multi-section

antennas

In this Section we shall discuss the methodology of experimental approach to bound
ﬁelds in the case of multi-section emitting and receiving antennas which constitutes a
practical realization of particular experimental scheme considered in Section 4. The
EA and RA are composed from four and two sections, respectively, as it is shown in

9

Fig.5. The arrows mean directions of conduction currents at some given instant of time.
Therefore, the symmetric form of multi-section emitting and receiving antennas implies
no net current in radial directions. This property is important to reduce considerably
undesirable electric dipole radiation in the case of EA and, in addition, to suppress any
disturbing eﬀect produced by electric dipole radiation in RA. Put in other terms, it
provides us with a higher ratio of bound-to-radiation ﬁeld strength (note that standard
antennas are designed to reach the highest ratio of radiation-to-bound ﬁeld strength in
order to enhance the radiation). This circumstance is of crucial importance as concerns
empirical observations of bound magnetic ﬁelds as well as the precision of measurements.
In respect to the approximation of quasi-stationary current, the use of multi-section
1
antennas improves considerably the basic criteria r
ω . In fact, all radial parts of each
section make no contribution in generation of magnetic ﬁelds (bound or radiation) due to
the cancelation of current ﬂows in adjacent parts of neighbor sections. It stands out the
role played by the arc fragment of every section, being thus the only part of the multi-
section antenna capable to produce magnetic ﬁelds. Since the resultant magnetic ﬁeld is
determined entirely as a superposition of magnetic ﬁelds created by each section, then
the applicability of the approximation of quasi-stationary current resides on its validity
for each section. As a consequence, we can consider the criteria for the quasi-stationary
current approximation of a multi-section antenna as:

c ≪

ω

≪

ωc =

nc
r

(18)

where ωc denotes the critical value of the frequency of oscillations and n means the
number of sections.

Thus, the use of multi-section type of antennas was fully justiﬁed in our approach by
the above-exposed practical reasons. Let us now describe a technical realization of the
experimental set-up as regards the emitting multi-section antenna (see Fig.6). A fast
high-voltage spark gap (SG) constitutes the driving circuit of the EA and it is connected
with the multi-section emitting circuit via the blocking capacitor C which also plays the
role of the energy storage element. The whole circuit, presented in Fig.6, can be viewed

EA. We also assume that the values of L, C and the radius r are given in the range of
ωc. The high-
applicability of the approximation of quasi-stationary current, i.e. ω0 ≪
voltage supply (HV) is connected to the EA via the resistor Rf . The latter determines
the time necessary to charge the capacitor C as well as the duration of the period in a
series involving successive charges and discharges.

The magnitude of the initial current ﬂow in the EA depends on the value of high-
voltage U and the discharge time τ . The technical realization described above and
presented in Fig.6, generally speaking, does not imply harmonic oscillations in the circuit
of the EA. As a consequence, further on we shall assume the exponential character of
the discharge process, i.e. U (t) = U (0) exp(
t/τ ) and the shape of the emitted signal
will be conditioned by the Kirchhoﬀ equation for the emitting circuit:

The form of the calculated e.m.f. ε(t) depends on the parameter τ which was intro-

(2) the width hRA = 100mm and (3) the gap between adjacent sections - 3mm. Both
sections of this antenna are connected in parallel. Their frames are also made of copper

on a wooden table and all metallic objects (with the capacity to reﬂect EM radiation)
were removed from the experimental installations at distances exceeding 1.5m. It as-

EM perturbations received by the RA could in no way be attributed to reﬂected ﬁelds.

5 Experimental measurements

≥

We remind the reader that the zero crossing method (see Section 2) provides the type
of variations ∆t(R) which are very sensitive to the particular value of the parameter v
from the range v
c and, therefore, it should be considered as a reliable empirical test
of the applicability of the standard retardation condition (v = c) to bound ﬁelds. In
Fig.8 we show the results of numerical calculations (for multi-section antennas) on the
c
base of the Eqs. (23)-(28) as regards the assumption on the undeﬁned parameter v
which was introduced to represent the spreading velocity of bound ﬁeld components.
Dot lines describe the time shift ∆t dependence on the distance R between emitting
and receiving antennas at the retardation conditions v = c; v = 2c and v = 10c. The
we plotted in a continuous line. It is worth emphasizing that the types
limit case v =
of numerical predictions for v = c and v =
are qualitatively in agreement with the
predictions obtained in the case of an idealized magnetic dipole (see Fig.4).

Now we are in a position to apply the zero crossing method and to subject theoretical
predictions ∆t(R) to empirical test. For this purpose, we placed the emitting and the
receiving antennas in parallel positions as it is shown in Fig.7. Keeping the orientation
of antennas unchanged, we varied the distance between them in the range of R =
200cm, applying the step of ∆R = 20cm. At each position we succeeded in
40
producing detectable signals on the oscilloscope screen.
In order to implement the
zero crossing method (discussed in Section 3), we measured the instant tcross when
the oscillating disturbance crosses zero line for the ﬁrst time. At short distances, the
amplitude of the whole signal is large, hence providing the maximum steepness to the
front of the signal. It allowed us to measure the value of tcross with due precision (the
estimated error was less than 0.1ns).

sin(ωt

To complete our measurements we had to obtain the information on the instant
t′
cross when the reference signal (i.e. the harmonics of the type εr =
ωR/c))
crosses zero line for the ﬁrst time. Since it cannot be done in direct measurements (the
EA does not generate the reference signal alone), we proposed indirect but nevertheless
unambiguous determination of the value of t′
cross. As it already has been stated, at large
distances R−3, R−2-terms result negligible in comparison with the radiation R−1-term.
In fact, the numerical calculations based on Eq. (28) indicated that at the distance of
R = 200cm between the EA and RA, a relative contribution of both R−3 and R−2-terms
into the ﬁnal signal is less than 0.1%. It means that at R = 200cm there is practically
no diﬀerence between the values of tcross and t′
cross (here we remind a reader to see
diagrams in Figs.2 and 3). Thus, the value of t′
cross once established at R = 200cm,
can be easily recalculated for any R < 200cm. It provides us the reliable experimental
200cm.

6 Conclusions

Based on these results, one can conclude that empirical data unambiguously indicate
on the non-applicability of the standard retardation constraint (v = c) to bound ﬁelds.
Since the standard classical electrodynamics is generally acknowledged nowadays as the
most orthodox example of a causal and deterministic classical ﬁeld theory, one can
suppose that the standard theory may contain certain (perhaps, empirically unveriﬁed)
causal assumptions which go beyond what is fair to assume in the framework of the
mathematical formalism. The ﬁrst experimental indication on a diﬀerence between
propagation velocity of bound and radiation ﬁelds can be regarded as an unexpected
causal asymmetry in the structure of possible solutions to Maxwell’s equations. The
latter has no grounds in the formalism of the existing electromagnetic theory and implies
that a possible interpretive framework can be wider than the standard account allows.
In our opinion, the presence of this fundamental uncertainty in the classical EM theory
is due to the fact that perhaps there has not been realized the considerable importance
in careful drawing and empirical testing distinction between bound and radiation ﬁeld
components. Put in other terms, it has to imply a considerable shift of attention towards
the conception of the velocity dependent (bound) components of EM ﬁeld because they
may result of a crucial importance in illuminating alternative foundations of the classical
electrodynamics.

In this respect, advocates of alternative views may appeal to the fact that at the
time of Hertz experiments on propagation of EM interactions there was already a con-
sistent rival approach to electromagnetic phenomena that emphasized the distinction
between spreading velocity of bound and radiation EM ﬁeld components. In the his-
tory of physics it is regarded as Helmholtz’s electrodynamics[14]. Moreover, Maxwell’s
equations appeared in Helmholtz’s theoretical scheme in a limit when the spreading ve-
locity of bound (electrostatic in Helmholtz’s classiﬁcation) electric components tended
to inﬁnity.
In this case, the propagation velocity of radiation waves (electrodynamic
components in Helmholtz’s classiﬁcation) resulted equal to the velocity of light as it
was assumed in Maxwell’s theory (for more details, see[6],[15]). Recently, the same con-
clusion on a possibility of essential diﬀerence between spreading velocity of bound and
radiation EM ﬁeld components was obtained in completely independent and mathemat-
ically consistent approaches to the classical electromagnetic theory based on Maxwell’s
equations[3],[16]−[17].

We also have to point out the fact of a nearly perfect coincidence between experi-
mental data and theoretical predictions based on the Eq. (9) for the spreading velocity
of bound ﬁelds highly exceeding the velocity of light (v
c). This circumstance can be
considered as a strong indication on the validity of a new generalized Biot-Savart law
in form similar to the Eq. (9) which diﬀers form the generally accepted expression (8)
only as regards the spreading velocity of bound components, i.e. the condition v

≫

c.

Nevertheless, speaking in strict terms, any discrepancy of experimental observations
with theoretical predictions made on the basis of the standard condition v = c does
not automatically imply the correctness of our hypothesis in form of the Eq. (9) but
rather experimentally observed violation of the applicability of the standard retardation

condition to bound ﬁelds. By its signiﬁcance and importance, this experimental fact may
be comparable with the violation of Bell’s inequalities in quantum mechanics. It is very
likely that both manifestations of non-locality might have the same origin. Moreover, we
are inclined to think that non-local characteristics of bound ﬁelds shed a new promising
light on a possible close relationship between classical electrodynamics and quantum
mechanics.

≈

Having in mind the challenge of measuring very feeble eﬀects produced by bound
ﬁelds, we have introduced into experimental practice multi-section emitting and receiv-
ing antennas that are designed to rise substantially the ratio of bound-to-radiation ﬁeld
strength. However, our experimental experience led us to the conclusion that a direct
measurement of the spreading velocity of bound ﬁelds still must be qualiﬁed as a rather
diﬃcult task even if one implements experimental facilities available in modern physics
laboratories. In this respect, we would like to emphasize some technical circumstances
of our experimental approach. Due to a rapid fall of bound ﬁeld amplitudes as R−2
and R−3, the range of variation ∆R of the distance between emitting and receiving
antennas has been essentially restricted by approximately 1m. If we consider EM waves
travelling with the velocity of light c, the diﬀerence ∆R
1m means the time shift
∆t = ∆R/c
3ns. In order to achieve a necessary precision of measurements (within
the time range of 3ns), the front of a generated signal must not exceed the value of 1ns,
(i.e. 4ns for a period of one quasi-harmonic signal) which corresponds to the angular
109Hz. Numerical calculations show that a typical size of antenna
frequency ω = 1.5
109Hz) is about several cm and, therefore, at small
(emitting at the frequency ω = 1.5
0.1m) comparable with the size of the EA, the amplitude
distances (for instance, R
of the output signal should be of the order of 1V . The crucial parameter that is the
ratio of bound-to-radiation ﬁeld strength also falls down rapidly with the distance as
0.2m and
approximately
results negligible already at distances exceeding 1m. Hence, if there is an intention to
produce any observable separation of bound and radiation components at R = 1m, the
value of the ratio of bound-to-radiation ﬁeld strength has to be close to unity at this
108Hz. It implies a considerable
distance, i.e. one has to assume that ω
rise of the front of generated signals up to nearly 5ns which already will exceed the
permissible time shift of about 3ns, making impossible any visual distinction between
bound and radiation contributions into the resultant signal.

Thus, at present stage these circumstances made it almost unattainable task to
undertake direct measurements of spreading velocity of bound magnetic ﬁelds. Having in
mind experimental facilities available at the time of Hertz’s experiments (1886-1891), we
might intuitively assume that the problem of propagation of electromagnetic interactions
could hardly have been resolved deﬁnitely at the end of the 19th century in favor of one of
the rival theories (Maxwell’s or Helmholtz’s electrodynamics). Nevertheless, in contrast
to our possible reservations, Hertz’s contemporaries accepted his experiments almost
unconditionally, i.e. by the beginning of the 20th century the problem of propagation
of electromagnetic interactions had been considered as deﬁnitely resolved. It gave a rise
to the conviction that the standard retardation condition (v = c) has a general validity
for all components of EM ﬁeld. In this respect, we stress again that Hertz’s experiments

16

were not especially thought-out to test the applicability of the retardation condition to
bound ﬁelds, since at the time of Hertz’s experiments the classical electromagnetism had
not yet been completed in its modern theoretical framework. Therefore, from the point
of view of the modern EM theory, this fact implies a methodological incompleteness of
Hertz’s experimental approach. In our opinion, these historical circumstances combined
with the extreme feebleness of the eﬀects produced by bound ﬁelds deprived the majority
of physicists (from the beginning of the 20th century up till now) of the interest towards
experimental study of bound ﬁelds properties.

APPENDIX. Derivation of the value of magnetic ﬁeld due to an idealized

magnetic dipole under the general assumption v

c

≥

First, it is worth reminding that Eq.

(8) was obtained in[8] at the low velocity
relativistic limit of the exact solution (6) of the D’Alembert equation (7) when the
centripetal acceleration of the moving charges is ignored. The latter requirement implies
that in places where the antenna loop is curved, the current ﬂow I(t) and the rate of
time variation of current ˙I(t) are parallel to the tangential direction along the loop.
To illustrate the derivation of Eq. (10) from the hypothetical general case driven by
Eq. (9), we shall use the same assumptions as it is done in[8] and follow the analogous
procedure implemented in[9].

≪

Thus, if the radius r of the loop of the antenna is negligible in comparison with the
distance to the point of observation R, i.e. r
R, then the shape of the antenna has
no importance and it can be chosen in a way to simplify theoretical calculations. So, let
us consider the small current carrying coil ABCD shown in Fig.9. The arrow indicates
the direction of the ﬂowing current. The sections AD and BC are arcs circles, with
centers at the point of observation P . Both circles have the radius value R and R + δR
R. Thus, if the length of the section AD is equal to r (where
respectively, where δR
r

R), then the length of BC is r(1 + δR/R).
Let us now determine the magnetic ﬁeld B at the point of observation P and at the
time of observation t. According to Eq. (9) the contributions of the currents in the
sections AB and CD are both zero since k
n = 0. Thus, we can calculate the value of
the magnetic ﬁeld generated only by the sections BC and AD :

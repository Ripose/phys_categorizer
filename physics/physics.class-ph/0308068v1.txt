system

aDepartment of Physics, Bar Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel.

We have previously discussed the diﬀusion limited problem of the bounded one-dimensional mul-

titrap system where no external ﬁel is included and pay special attention to the transmission of

the diﬀusing particles through the system of imperfect traps. We discuss here the case in which

an external ﬁeld is included to each trap and ﬁnd not only the transmission but also the energy

associated with the diﬀusing particles in the presence and absence of such ﬁelds. From the energy

we ﬁnd the speciﬁc heat Ch and show that for certain values of the parameters associated with the

multitrap system it behaves in a manner which is suggestive of phase transition. Moreover, this

phase transition is demonstrated not only through the conventional single peak at which the speciﬁc

heat function is undiﬀerentiable but also through the less frequent phenomenon of double peaks.

INTRODUCTION

The diﬀusion of classical particles in the presence of traps have been studied by various

authors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The idea of imperfect traps was introduced in [6] and elaborated further

by others [7, 8] which study, especially, the nearest neighbours distance in the presence of a

single imperfect trap. We note that the imperfect trap may represent a model for many real

physical situations that are not easy to tackle directly. Among these one may enumerate all

the reactions, including the chemical ones, in which the results for the reacting particles can

not be predicted beforehand. That is, these reactions may result in either the elimination

of some of the reacting particles or changing the values of some physical parameters that

are associated with them. Among these parameters one may mention, for example, the

transmission and absorption coeﬃcients of the diﬀusing particles, their energy and the other

variables derived from it such as the speciﬁc heat, the entropy etc. In [9, 10] the transmission

properties of these particles in the presence of N imperfect traps, without any external ﬁeld,

were intensively discussed for both cases of large and small N. It was found [9] that the

larger is N the higher is the transmission so that for N

the probability that all the

→ ∞

particles diﬀuse through all the traps tends to unity.

In this work we include an external ﬁeld to each trap and ﬁnd the eﬀect of it upon

the diﬀusing particles. We note that the case of a bias ﬁeld in the presence of a single

imperfect trap was discussed by Condat et al in [8] which studied among other things the

eﬀect of a uniform ﬁeld on the distribution of nearest neighbours distances. In this work we

introduce the bounded multitrap system and discuss not only the trasmission that results

from including an external ﬁeld to each trap but also the energy associated with the diﬀusing

particles. This energy is discussed for both cases of the existence and absence of ﬁeld and

we show that it is highly sensitive to the presence of it so that increasing its intensity by a

small amount may result in an unproportionally large change in the energies of the diﬀusing

particles. This unexpected change in the energy entails, for certain values of the parameters

associated with the multitrap system, a corresponding large and even discontinuous changes

in the speciﬁc heat Ch derived from it. We show that actually the speciﬁc heat goes through

phase transition which is demonstrated not only through the conventional undiﬀerentiable

single peak but also through double peaks [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17].

In this context

we note that phase transitions in one-dimensional systems were discussed in the literature

2

(see, for example, [11, 12]). Moreover, double peak phase transitions were, numerically,

found [12] in the analogous quantum example of the one-dimensional bounded multibarrier

system. Lieung and Neda [13] and also Kim et al [14] have found double peaks in the form

of the responsive curves which are apparently associated with dynamically induced phase

transitions. Tanaka et al [15] have found such double peaks in antiferromagnetic materials

corresponding to magnetic phases where the external magnetic ﬁeld has a corresponding role

to the parameter c here. Ko and Asakawa [17] have found also double peaks with regards

to the phases of the quark-gluon plasma which may be thought of as a large number of

interactions in a bounded region.

In Section 2 we represent the appropriate terminology and terms associated with the

one-dimensional bounded imperfect multitrap system as in [9, 10]. We then show, using the

N 2x2 transfer matrices method [18, 19], that for certain values of the parameters associated

with the multitrap system the transmission probability through all the traps tends to unity

in the presence of an external ﬁeld. This was shown in [9, 10] by applying the same method

for the absence of ﬁeld case. Using the results of Section 2 we calculate in Section 3 the

energy associated with the diﬀusing particles for both cases of the presence and absence of

a bias ﬁeld. For this we use, without introducing it, the single 4nx4n transfer matrix (as

done in [9]) for calculating the coeﬃcients of the density of the diﬀusing particles. This

has certain advantages over the equivalent N 2x2 transfer matrices used in Section 2 for

ﬁnding the transmission. In Section 4 we calculate the relevant speciﬁc heat Ch and show

that for certain values of the variables associated with the bounded system it behaves in

a manner which is suggestive of phase transition. This is demonstrated in the presence of

an undiﬀerentiable discontinuous peak in the curve of Ch as function of the temperature.

Moreover, as noted, we ﬁnd for some values of the relevant variables that this phase transition

is demonstrated in the form of double peaks. Similar single and double peaks were found also

in the analogous quantum system of the bounded one-dimensional multibarrier potential [12].

We then calculate the relevant critical exponents associated with these phase transitions. In

Section 5 we conclude with a brief summary.

II. THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL BOUNDED IMPERFECT MULTITRAP SYSTEM

We assume that all the imperfect traps, through which and between them the particles

diﬀuse, have the same width that depends upon the number N of them and the total length

L of the system. That is, denoting the total width of the N traps by a and the total interval

among them by b and realizing that there are N
that the width of each is a
N and the interval between any two neighbouring traps is
We ﬁnd it useful [9, 10] to deﬁne the ratio c of the total interval to total width c = b

1)(1+c) (thus one have N equal
intervals between the origin x = 0 and the end of the system at x = L). We assume that

1 =

(N

−

the diﬀusion’s natural direction, without the inﬂuence of a ﬁeld, is towards the positive

direction of the x axis. This is taken care of through the initial conditions of the following

set (2) which stipulate that at t = 0 the particles are concentrated, except for an initial

conﬁguration f , at the left hand sides of the N traps. According to the arrangement of the

multitrap system (see the discussion after Eq (1)) the left hand sides of all the traps face

the negative direction of the x axis. Thus, the diﬀusive motion for t > 0 is towards the

right hand sides of the traps which face the positive direction of the spatial axis. Also, it

is assumed that each trap have the same ﬁeld associated with it so that any particle that

approach it may be, depending on the direction of the ﬁeld, either attracted or repelled by it.

The corresponding initial and boundary balue problem associated with the one-dimensional

bounded imperfect N trap system is [8, 9, 10]

The boldfaced x and `x denote that the appropriate spatial variables are N-tuples and not

single values. This results from the remarked initial condition that at t = 0 the particles are

concentrated, except for an initial conﬁguration f (x, `x, 0), at the left hand faces of the N

traps (see the second equation of set (2)). The N-tuple `x denotes the locations of these left

hand faces so that according to the arrangement of the multitrap system (see the discussion

after Eq (1)), we have

Note that although the discussed system is one-dimensional and all the N components of

x, `x are taken from the same linear range of (0, L) they should not be exclusive. That is,

as for an N-dimensional vector, some components of any N-tuple point or even all of them

may have the same value. In order to obtain simpler anlytical expressions and especially for

obtaining numerical results of the interesting physical quantities we study in the following

the scalar components of the ”vectorized” set (2) for which we use the single value spatial

varibles x and `x. in such case one may write the set (2) in the form

where `xm is given by Eq (3) and denotes the left hand face of the m-th trap. ρ(x, `xm, t)

is the density of the diﬀusing particles and D is the diﬀusion constant which is assumed to

have inside the traps a value Di diﬀerent from that outside them De [9, 10]. We note that

one may generally ﬁnd in the literature values of D in the range 0.9
example, p.337 in [22] where it is noted that 0.5 cm2

sec is the order of magnitude of D at room
temperature and atmospheric pressure). We have assigned here for De and Di the values

of De = 0.8 and Di = 0.4. ρt(x, `xm, t) and ρxx(x, `xm, t) are respectively the ﬁrst derivative

with respect to the time t and the second derivative with respect to x. The parameter V is

the diﬀusion velocity that results from the presence of the ﬁeld and its magnitude as well as

its sign represent respectively the intensity and direction of the ﬁeld. The second equation

in the set (4) is the initial condition at t = 0 the ﬁrst term of it signiﬁes, through the δ,

that there is an initial concentration of the particles at the left hand face of the trap located

at x = `xm, 1

denotes an additional initial conﬁguration of the density that depends upon x and `xm. The

third equation is the boundary value condition in which the term that corresponds, through

the diﬀusion velocity V , to the presence of the ﬁeld is introduced. The parameter k denotes

the degree of imperfection of the traps (in [8] it is termed the trapping rate) so that in

the limit k

the trap becomes ideal in which case any particle that approaches it is

absorbed. We follow the procedure in [9, 10] for V = 0 and decompose the set (4) into two

secondary sets as follows

The set (6) is the ideal trap problem in which no external ﬁeld is present as may be

realized from the absence of k and V . Also, the initial condition of the set (6) is characterized

by the initial density f (x, `x, 0). The set (5) is the imperfect trap problem which includes

the external ﬁeld and its initial condition contains only the ﬁrst term of the corresponding

condition of the general set (4). The solution of (4) may be written as in [9, 10] (see Eq (4)

there),

where ρ1(x, `xm, t) is the solution of the initial and boundary value problem of the set (5)

and ρ2(x, `xm, t) is that of (6). The ideal trap problem of the set (6) is the same as that

discussed in [9, 10] so, following the discussion there, we may write for ρ2(x, `xm, t)

In order to adapt the solutions ρ1 and ρ2 to the bounded N multitrap system we may use

either the N 2x2 transfer matrices method [18, 19] or the equivalent single 4Nx4N transfer

matrix formalism. These methods are used in [9, 10] for V = 0 and we have found that the

probability that all the particles pass through all the N traps increases with the number

N so that in the limit N

this probability tends to unity. We use in this section the

In order to ﬁnd the density from Eq (7) at each point x in the multitrap system we

have to determine the coeﬃcients A and B of the imperfect and ideal trap components at

this point. If, for example, this point happen to be between the m-th and the (m + 1)-th

traps then for ﬁnding the corresponding A and B one have to multiply m transfer matrices

each of the kind given by Eqs (12)-(15). For the following we denote the four components

of the two-dimensional matrix that results from the product of m two-dimensional transfer

matrices, where N

recursively as

TN11 = T(N

It is found that the component TN11 tends to unity for growing values of the variables

N and c. That is, the larger is either the number of traps or the intervals among them

(or both) the higher is the tendency of the component TN11 to unity. Note that this same

behaviour have been found also in [9] for V = 0 with respect to the same variables N and

c (see the discussion there after Eq (30)). As for the variable V it is found, as expected,

that the smaller is V , which means that the more decreased is the intensity of the ﬁeld that

pushes the diﬀusing particles towards the traps, the smaller becomes TN11. This means,

analogously to the V = 0 case discussed in [9], that only small part of the ensemble of the

diﬀusing particles pass through the traps. The same outcome of small TN11 and low passage

is obtained also when V is negative which means that now the ﬁeld pushes these particles

towards the negative direction of the x axis so that a large number of them do not succeed

to pass through the traps. It have also been found regarding the total length of the system
L that TN11 →
become small and decrease beneath the unity value. Also, TN11 increases for larger values

1 for small values of L. Thus, when L grows the corresponding values of TN11

of either the time t or the chosen value of `xm that denotes the location of the left hand face

of the trap at which the particles are initially concentrated (see Eqs (3), (16)-(17)).

As for the component TN22 we ﬁrst note that it does not assume values outside the range

(0, 1) and that, dependent upon the place x (from the range 0

x

L) at which they are

calculated, its factors T22(m), 1

m

N, may tend in the limit of N

to either 1

or 0 as found in [9] (see Eq (26) there and the unnumbered equation after Eq (27)). Thus,

the product TN22 may likewise tends to either unity or 0 at this limit. Also, it is found that

the larger is either the number of traps N or the time t, where the ratio c is not large, the

higher is its tendency to zero. The same result is obtained also for small values of the total

length L, but for increasing values of c it clearly tends to unity. Note that TN22 does not

depend upon the variable V as seen from Eqs (15) and (18).

The component TN21 may range from very large negative values to very large positive

ones but there are speciﬁc ranges of N, L, c, V , k and t for which TN21 tends to zero. For

example, it is found that for growing c TN21 decreases towards zero but this vanishing of it

is very much fast for small c and very much slow for large values of it. Thus, it has been

found that increasing c in the range 20

c

causes TN21 to decreases so slowly that it

≤ ∞
may be regarded as almost constant over this range. As for the change of TN21 with N it is

≤

found that it assumes very high values for large N and small L but when L also grows to

a value which is comparable to that of N the component TN21 may decrease even to zero.

It is also found that the larger is V the smaller becomes the corresponding values of TN21.
11 but when

24 TN21 assumes very small values of the order of 10−

For example, for V

≥

V decreases beneath 20 the value of TN21 tends to become very large. Negative values of

V have almost the same eﬀect on TN21 as the corresponding positive ones. The diﬀerences

between them are demonstrated in the diﬀerent ranges of

than for the corresponding negative ones. Also TN21 increases for larger values of the time t

and decreases as the `xm from Eqs (3), (16)-(17) decreases.

We have found, according to the former discussion, that there are ranges of N, L, c, V ,

k and t for which the components of the total matrix TN , that result from the N products
at the right hand side of Eq (10), assume the limits of TN11 →

initial density do not change by the presence of either the traps or the ﬁelds or both of

them in which case the product of the N transfer matrices at the right hand side of Eq (10)

results in the two-dimensional unity matrix. This is seen in Figure 1 which is composed

of the three Subﬁgures A

That is, all the particles that approach the multitrap system pass through it without any

decrease in eitheir the ideal or the imperfect trap components of the density. Note that

for V = 0 we have shown in [9] this unity value of the transmission for the imperfect trap

component of the density (see Eq (28) there).

III. THE ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH THE BOUNDED MULTITRAP SYS-

TEM

We, now, discuss the energy associated with the diﬀusing particles. This energy is com-

posed of two parts; kinetic and potential where the former results from the diﬀusive motion

and the later from the presence of the traps. In the absence of any external ﬁeld the classical

particles diﬀuse with an average diﬀusion velocity ¯vD given, for the one-dimensional case, by

q

2D
t where D is the diﬀusion constant. The last equation for ¯vD is obtained from
[22] ¯vD =
the known expression for the time t it takes to diﬀuse through a distance x which is t = x2
2D .
Note that since D have a value inside the traps, denoted here as Di, which is diﬀerent [9, 10]

from that outside, denoted De, the average diﬀusion velocity as well as the density from Eq

(7) diﬀer likewise in their values inside the traps from those outside. In such case the kinetic

energy of the particles may be written as EK(x, t) = 1

t where ρ(x, t) is
the density of the diﬀusing particles for V = 0 as in [9]. As remarked, the natural diﬀusive

D = ρ(x, t) D

2ρ(x, t)¯v2

motion, when V = 0, is towards the positive x axis so that when a ﬁeld is present and points

in that direction it accelerates the motion of the particles or decelerates it if it is oppositely

directed. In such case the part of the kinetic energy that results from the ﬁeld is added or

subtracted from the former expression for EK(x, t). Thus, using Eqs (7)-(9) we may write

11

the kinetic energy of the diﬀusing particles as

EK(x, `xm, t) =

ρ(x, `xm, t)(v2

2 denote respectively that the kinetic energy due to the ﬁeld is added or

subtracted from that for V = 0.

The potential energy associated with the presence of the traps may be found by assuming

that each trap exerts a force on the particles which is directly proportional to its degree of

imperfection k and inversely proportional to the squared distance from it. We assume an

inverse proportionality to the squared distance since the inﬂuence of the imperfect traps, in

comparison with that of the ideal ones, is thought to fastly decay with distance from them.

Thus, assuming, as in the former section, that the left hand sides of the traps, from which

the particles begin their diﬀusion, are located at the points x = `xm (see Eq (3)) one may

write the force on any particle that results from the trap as F (x, `xm) =

gk
`xm)2 . g in the
former equation for F (x, `xm) is the proportionality constant and the minus sign indicates

−

(x

that it is an attractive force. Using the expression for F (x, `xm) and assuming that each trap

serves as a central force source one may ﬁnd the potential energy from

where the imperfect trap component of the density for V = 0 is that found in [9] (see Eq

(6) there) and the ideal trap component is the same as that of the expression related to

the coeﬃecient B in Eqs (23)-(24). The coeﬃcients A and B in the last two equations

are numerically determined in this section from the single 4nx4n matrix method (see the

discussion after Eq (29) in [9]).

As one may expect the diﬀerences between the energies in the presence and absence of

the external ﬁeld are rather small for small values of positive V . This entails also small

diﬀerences for the corresponding average energies < E > and for the other variables derived

from it such as the speciﬁc heat Ch, the free energy F , the entropy S etc. When V increases in

positive values the diﬀerence between the energies Etotal(V =0)(x, `xm, t) and Etotal(V 6=0)(x, `xm, t)
(or equivalently between the energy for small V and that of a larger one) becomes so large

and pronounced that it leads for the later case, as seen in the following, to a phase transition.

That is, the presence of a ﬁeld that pushes the diﬀusing particles towards the traps causes

to a dramatic change in their average energies compared to the cases in which this ﬁeld is

absent or small. We note that the values of the energy obtained from Eqs (21)-(24) depend

sensitively upon the variables `xm, 1

m

N which denote the locations of the left hand

faces of the N traps (see Eq (3)).

≤

The remarked large change in the energy for small increase of V may be realized from

Subﬁgures A and B of Figure 2 each of which shows a three dimensional surface of the

13

energy as function of x and c. Both subﬁgures are drawn for N = 2, k = 1, L = 30 t = 1,

g = 1, De = 0.8, Di = 0.4, and for the ranges of c and x which are respectively 20

and 40

realize that increasing V by only 3 units causes to an unproportionally large increase in

the larger values of the energy as function of x and c from E

12 to E

14000. This

≈

≈

large jump of the energy results in a corresponding discontinuous change in the values of

the speciﬁc heat Ch which implies, as will be shown in the following section, that it goes

through a phase transition. This state of aﬀairs prevails also for negative V but compared

to the positive V case the large change in the energy occurs already at small values of

negative V as seen in Subﬁgures C and D of Figure 2. First of all, we note that when V

is negative it is directed opposite to the natural diﬀusive direction so that it decelerates

the particles in their motion. Thus, high negative values of V , that is,

V

t , where

2D
t

is the average velocity for V = 0 (see the discussion at the beginning of this section),

q
may stop the diﬀusive motion or even causes the particles to turn around and diﬀuse to the

opposite direction. Thus, returning to Subﬁgures C and D of Figure 2 we see that they

show three-dimensional surfaces of the energy as function of x and c for the same values

of k = g = t = 1, L = 30, De = 0.8, Di = 0.4 and the same ranges of 20

Subﬁgure D for N = 5 and V =

that decreasing V by only three tenths from

0.5 to

0.8 results in a tremendous change

in the higher values of the energy from

108. This entails, as will be shown

in the following section, a corresponding phase transition of the speciﬁc heat Ch. One may

explain these large changes of the energy in the presence of an external ﬁeld by reasoning

that increasing the intensity of the ﬁeld

V

beyond some limit value, that depends upon

the values of N, c, L, k, g, t, x, `xm, causes the particles to overcome any resistance related to

|

the diﬀusion in the presence of traps. Thus, their energy jumps unproportionally to the

change of

that causes it. A similar behaviour is encountered in Laser tubes [25] when

V

the pumping energy assumes a limit value beyond which the intensity of the produced light

jumps in a phase transitsional manner.

seen from the former discussion and Subﬁgures A

D of Figure 2 the presence of the ﬁeld

changes considerably the energies and therefore the average energy of the diﬀusing particles.

IV. SINGLE AND DOUBLE-PEAK PHASE TRANSITION IN THE SPECIFIC

HEAT OF THE BOUNDED MULTITRAP SYSTEM

associated statistical mechanics variables. For example, the speciﬁc heat Ch is obtained from

Figure 3 shows a three dimensional surface of the speciﬁc heat Ch from Eq (26) as function

P

of the ratio c and the temperature T where no external ﬁeld is included in which case the

appropriate energy to be substituted in the last equation is that from Eq (24). The other

related parameters are assigned the following values and ranges: N = 2, k = 1, L = 30,
t = 1, g = 1, `xm = Lc

0.1. Note that the former values

for N, k, g, L, t, xm and c are the same as those of Subﬁgures A

B of Figure 2. As

−

seen, the height of the surface for Ch increases with growing values of the ratio c untill some

maximum of Ch (not shown in the ﬁgure). Also, if one redraw the surface of Figure 3 for

small values of c and T then one may realize that it jumps abruptly upward to its maximal

values from which it descends in a similar manner to zero. These maximal values are arrayed

along horizontal lines which form, in relation to their neighbouring points, a hooked and

sharp edge which becomes widened and ﬂattened as c grows.

SINGLE AND DOUBLE-PEAK PHASE TRANSITION.....

16

The epeciﬁc heat Ch is certainly undiﬀerentiable at the sharp edge and so the function

Ch goes through phase transition at these points [11, 24]. We calculate at the following

the critical exponents associated with this and other kinds of discontinuity of the speciﬁc

heat. It is shown that increasing N, k or g, while keeping the values of the other parameters

constant, does not cause to any change in the form of the speciﬁc heat Ch as shown in Figure

3 except to its translation from its position along the c axis to a one that tends to be aligned

along the T axis. That is, the same surface of Ch is rotated in the c

T plane for growing

−

values of N, k or g. If, on the other hand, the value of the total length L is simultaneously

increased with that of N then the remarked rotation of the surface of Ch, obtained for large

values of N, is avoided and this surface remain in its form and place. Unlike the case of

V

= 0, to be discussed in the following, we ﬁnd for V = 0 that except for the remarked

points of discontinuity associated with smaller values of c and T there are no other points

at which Ch becomes discontinuous.

We discuss now the speciﬁc heat Ch obtained when an external ﬁeld is included with each

trap. It is found, as for the V = 0 case, that the corresponding curves of the speciﬁc heat

Ch jumps abruptly from zero for small c and T to their maximal values from which they

similarly descend to zero. Also, as for Figure 3, these maximal values are arranged along

lines which form a sharp edge for the small values of c and T which become widened and

ﬂattened as c increases. The speciﬁc heat function is clearly undiﬀerentiable along the sharp

edge which imply, as for the previously discussed V = 0 case, that it goes through phase

transition [11, 24] at these points. But, in contrast to the former case, there exist other

points, not at small values of c, along which the speciﬁc heat goes through phase transition.

This is demonstrated in Figures 4-5 which are drawn for the same values of N, V , k, L, t, xm

and the same range of c as those of Subﬁgures A
are drawn for N = 2, k = g = t = 1, L = 30, `xm = Lc

for Figure 4, as in Subﬁgure A of Figure 2, and V = 5 for Figure 5 as in Subﬁgure B of

Figure 2. Note that the surface for the smaller value of V = 2 in Figure 4 begins to assume,

for small c and T , the hooked and spiky appearance which becomes more pronounced and

stalagmite-like in Figure 5. Except for this discontinuity for small c and T there are no

other points, for this low positive value of V = 2, at which Ch becomes discontinuous. The

surface in Figure 5, however, which is drawn for V = 5, is shown partitioned into three

separated parts and one can see not only the more obvious discontinuity of the two spiky

6
SINGLE AND DOUBLE-PEAK PHASE TRANSITION.....

17

columns at the small values of c and T but also that related to the apparently continuous

large surface at large c’s. In order to be convinced of this we have isolated from Figure 5

four curves of the speciﬁc heat Ch as functions of the temerature T for the four larger values

of c = 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 as seen in Figure 6. All the values of the other related parameters such

as V , N, k, L, g, t and `xm remain the same as in Figure 5 and one can clearly see that

each curve of the four speciﬁc heats assumes the form of two inverted and indented tooth.

One may see that neither of these peaks, for all the four curves, is diﬀerentiable and so they

constitute a double-peak phase transition. We thus see, as remarked, that the large change

in the values of the energy in Subﬁgures A

B of Figure 2, which are drawn respectively

−
for V = 2 and V = 5, is aﬀected through the phase transition of the corresponding speciﬁc
heat in Figures 5-6. This depends, as noted, upon the value of `xm = Lc

N (1+c) , so we expect
that changing its value may result in ﬁnding double peaks phase transitions at other values
of c and N. This is indeed the case as, for example, one may ﬁnd for `xm = 2Lc

N (1+c)
(not shown here), which is the location of the left hand face of the second trap, where N = 4

N (1+c) + L

and c is from the range 10.6

c

10.

≥

≥

From the former discussion we see that for positive values of V there is associated a

single peak for the smaller values of c and a double peak for some higher values of it. When

we consider, however, negative values of V we ﬁnd that the double peaks generally emerge

for the smaller values of c. This is demonstrated in Subﬁgure A of Figure 7 which shows

2 curves of the speciﬁc heat Ch as function of the temperature T for V =

1.76 where

−

N, k, g, t, L, `xm have the same values as those of Figures 6. That is, N = 2, k = 1, g = 1,
t = 1, L = 30 and `xm = Lc

N (1+c) . But in contrast to Figure 6 which shows double peaks for
large values of c the corresponding two double peak curves in Subﬁgure A of Figure 7 are

for c = 0.3 and c = 0.312. In this case the ﬁrst peaks of the two curves are small compared

to the seconds which are also less peaked. The appropriate energy to be associated with

negative V is that of the expression (23) in which one should take, as remarked, the minus
sign in front of V 2
2 .

As in the positive V case these double peaks depend upon the value of `xm so one may

expect that changing it results in ﬁnding double peaks at diﬀerent values of N and c. This is

shown in Subﬁgures B of Figure 7 which shows 8 double peaks curves of the speciﬁc heat as
function of T for `xm = 2Lc

N (1+c) which is the point at which the left hand face of the
secon trap is located. In this case the values of the appropriate N and V for these curves are

N (1+c) + L

SINGLE AND DOUBLE-PEAK PHASE TRANSITION.....

respectively N = 5 and V =

0.37 and those of the c’s are c = 1.5+0.065

n, n = 1, 2, . . . 7.

−

·

Note that all the eight second peaks touch each other and seem as one curve and this is also

for the eight ﬁrst peaks which are, as in Subﬁgure A, shorter than the corresponding second

peaks. This phase transition of Ch corresponds, as remarked, to the very large change the

energy goes through for exactly these values of c, N, t, g, k, `xm and in the neighbourhoud of

V =

0.5 which have been encountered in Subﬁgures C

D of Figure 2. These subﬁgures

change in the energy, which is unproportionally large compared to the slight change in

of Figure 7. In Subﬁgure C we have drawn two curves of Ch as functions of T for N = 4,

V =

N (1+c) and for the two values
of c = 0.39, 0.4. Note that although the two Subﬁgures A and C diﬀer in their values of

−

N, V and c they are, nevertheless, similar to each other. In Subﬁgure D we have drawn 4

curves of the speciﬁc heat Ch as functions of the temperature T for N = 5, g = k = t = 1,

L = 30, De = 0.8, Di = 0.4, V =
corresponding `xm is `xm = 3Lc

−
N (1+c) which is the point at which the left hand face of
the third trap is located. As seen from this subﬁgure all the 4 ﬁrst extrema are separated

0.22 and the four values of c = 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9. The

N (1+c) + 2L

from each other but the corresponding second peaks are tangent to each other and seem as

one curve. Note that these second peaks are certainly diﬀerentiable and the derivatives at

these points are zero. Also, one may see that the ﬁrst extremum of two of the curves in

Subﬁgure D are not local maximum but local minimum, that is, they are not peaks as for

the other two curves of this subﬁgure. The values of the corresponding c’s of these local

minima are c = 1.6, 1.7.

[24]

one may calculate the related critical exponents χ [24] associated with these phase tran-

sitions by using the following equation in the neighbourhood of the critical temperature Tc

where ǫ = T

where the unity term denotes the ﬁrst order of the derivative of the speciﬁc heat with respect
to ǫ which is denoted in Eq (28) by `Ch(ǫ). The value of χ may be obtained by plotting the

curve of Ch(ǫ) in the close neighbourhood of T = Tc and one may realize from the appended

ﬁgures that χ actually assumes diﬀerent values. Thus, assigning to the constants A, B the

respective values of 0 and 1 and plotting, as remarked, the graphs of Ch(ǫ) in the immediate

neighbourhoud of the single peaks in Figures 3-4, which are located at small c and T , one

may calculate χ, using Eqs (27)-(28), as χ

single peaks of Figure 5 which are also located at small c and T . That is, repeating the

Comparing the phase transition behaviour of the bounded one-dimensional multitrap

system to that of the corresponding quantum array of the bounded one-dimensional multi-

barrier potential [12] one may notice the following similarities and diﬀerences. The speciﬁc

heats of both systems exhibit the same discontinuous jump at small values of T but whereas

in the multitrap system Ch decreases, for growing values of T , to zero the corresponding

quantum Ch does not vanish but tends, for large T , to a ﬁnite value (see Figures 1-7 in [12]).

Also, both systems show for small c (which have the same meaning in the quantum system

as here) a similar behaviour which is characterized by some hasty and large jump of Ch. A

remarked diﬀerence is that the critical exponent in the quantum system was found to be [12]

χ = 1

2 whereas we ﬁnd several values of χ for the multitrap array. Finally, the phenomenon
of the double peaks at which the speciﬁc heat Ch is undiﬀerentiable are discernable in both

systems.

The free energy F may be obtained, for either the presence or absence of the external

ﬁeld, from F =

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have discussed the diﬀusion limited problem in the presence of a bounded imperfect

multitrap system and external ﬁelds through which an ensemble of classical particles diﬀuse.

The analytical methods previously used [9, 10] to discuss the transmission of the particles

through this system in the absence of an external ﬁeld were also used here in the presence

of it. Thus, the N 2x2 transfer matrices were used, as in [9], for discussing the transmission

through the multitrap system for V

= 0 and the single 4nx4n transfer matrix for studying

the energy and the other related variables associated with the diﬀusing particles such as the

speciﬁc heat Ch etc. It has been found, as for the V = 0 case in [9], that for certain values of

the parameters associated with the multitrap system the transmission coeﬃcient [9, 10] of

the diﬀusing particles unexpectedly increases for growing values of the number N of traps.

Moreover, this coeﬃcient tends to unity when N or c (or both of them) becomes very large

in which case all the particles diﬀuse through all the traps. This has been veriﬁed not only

for positive V which pushes the particles towards the traps but also for negative values of

it that repell the particles towards the negative direction of the x axis.

The unique characteristics of the mutitrap system become more pronounced regarding the

energy of the diﬀusing particles in the presence of an external ﬁeld. Thus, it has been found

that increasing V , for either positive or negative values of it, by even a small amount results

in an unproportional large increase in the energy of the diﬀusing particles so that when

one tries to calculate the related speciﬁc heat Ch he may ﬁnd that it goes through phase

transition. Moreover, for certain values of the parameters associated with the multitrap

system such as its total length L, the ratio c, the time t and the coeﬃcients g and k one may

ﬁnd that the mentioned phase transition is demonstrated in the form of a double peak. The

value of the related critical exponents associated with these phase transitions were found to

vary between 1

9 and 3

that changing the value of V fron 2 to 5 results in a large change of the energy. This change is

demonstrated in the form of Ch in Figures 4-5 for small c and T and in Figure 6 for larger values

of c.

FIG. 7: The four subﬁgures exhibit, under diﬀerent values of N , V , `xm and c, the double peak

phenomenon in the speciﬁc heat Ch as function of T . All the 4 subﬁgures are drawn for the

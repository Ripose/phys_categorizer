We show that two oscillatory charges of masses M1 and M2 immersed
in a dielectric medium separated R apart act on each other a uni-
versal attractive force, or gravity, resulting from the charges’ mu-
tual radiation depolarization-ﬁeld and magnetic-ﬁeld (RDM) resultant
Lorentz force. The exact Newtonian-Maxwellian solution for this force
0e4c4/ρl¯h2, X is the suscepti-
is Fg = GM1M2/R2, where G = 4πX µ2
bility and ρl linear mass density of the medium, and the remaining
are fundamental constants of the usual meaning. The prediction is
in a separate work shown to hold identically between neutral bodies
composed of charges of any signs; the nature of the problem is brieﬂy
commented here.

I Radiation ﬁelds. Radiation depolarization ﬁelds

Consider two point charges q1 and q2 oscillating with an angular frequency Ωq1 and
Ωq2 about their equilibrium positions R1 and R2 respectively, immersed in a uniform,
isotropic and non-absorbing dielectric medium. Put here R1 = 0; the separation distance
of the two charges is then

R = R2 − R1 = R2 − 0 = R2;

R = |R|

(1)

The oscillation of each charge may be thought of as being at any given time in a speciﬁc
orientation as a result of environmental action of statistical nature, for a duration long
so as to permit the resulting electromagnetic waves to be described below to travel many
loops between the charges, and yet short compared to the time in which the corresponding
particle properties (such as discussed in Sec. II) are measured. For the evaluation below we
can suppose the charge radiation displacement (that which contributes to the radiation),
uqi(T ), is oriented along the Z-axis perpendicular to the line joining the two charges, R,
or X-axis (Figure 1) i = 1 and 2, and is generally sinusoidal, uqi(T ) = Aqi sin(ΩqiT ),
Aqi being the displacement amplitude. The eﬀect from other orientations will then be
included in the end results later through a normalization factor.

According to Maxwellian electromagnetism the charges generate owing to their os-
cillations along Z-axis here electromagnetic waves composed of transverse electric and

1

magnetic ﬁelds propagated in radial directions. Regard ﬁrst charge 1 as the source
charge and charge 2 the test charge. Along a radial path l making an angle θ at the
Z-axis (see inset (a) of Figure 1), with θ in question here being close to π/2 so that
K1(θ) · l ≈ K1(θ) · l/ cos( π
2 − θ) = K1R, and at an azimuthal angle φ, the radiation electric
ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld of the source charge, 1, propagated to the test charge, 2, are given
by the standard equations (e.g. D.J. Griﬃths, ”Introduction to Electrodynamics”, 1981):

E1(R2, θ, T ) =

(3)

Where µ0 is the permeability, c the velocity of light in the given medium, Ω1 and K1
the angular frequency and wavevector of the radiation ﬁelds, or preﬁxed with a ”normal
mode” for a same reason as given in [1], and α1 the initial phase of charge 1 here; Aq1 is
as speciﬁed earlier. For completeness of information only, Ω1 and Ωq1 above are related
as Ω1 = Ωq1K1b as given from an explicit continuum-limit solution if the electromagnetic
process is represented by a mechanical process executed in a chain of coupled oscillators
of a separation distance b [2].

The radiation ﬁelds are as shown by (2) and (3) strongest for θ = π/2 (Figure 1) at
which l coincides with R, and reduces with θ, to zero at θ = 0 (i.e. along the Z-axis). The
ﬁelds are independent of the azimuthal angle φ; φ is thus not explicated as independent
variable. The ﬁeld strength contour is a torus, or donut ring, about the Z-axis.

At its source, R = 0, the electric ﬁeld E1(0, θ, T ) for the location being ﬁxed is time
dependent only. Associated with E1(0, θ, T ) there is an applied ﬁeld Eq∗1(T ) as measured
in the absence of the dielectric medium; call this the free space—here meaning free of the
given dielectric medium. According to the established physics for dielectric materials (see
e.g. N.W. Ashcroft and D. Mermin, ”Solid State Physics”, 1976), the two ﬁelds above are
related by Eq∗1(T ) = kE1(0, T ), k being the dielectric constant of the medium. Assume
here the dielectric is nonpolar (having no electric dipole moment in the absence of external
ﬁeld); the applied ﬁeld Eq∗1(T ) produces thereby a depolarization ﬁeld

Ep1(T ) = −X Eq∗

1 (T ),

(4)

X (= k − 1) being the susceptibility of the dielectric medium. The polarization of the
medium is illustrated in inset (b) of Figure 1. Assuming Eq∗
1 is relatively small for the
given medium and wave frequency such that the polarization is linear with the applied
ﬁeld, then X is a constant. It thereby follows that Ep1(T ) will alternate in phase with
Eq∗
1 (T ), and will by virtue of its oscillation similarly be propagated in the medium as the
function Ep1(R, θ, T ) called accordingly radiation depolarization ﬁeld. Thus, substituting
(2) into (4) directly gives at charge 2:

Ep1(R, θ, T ) = −

As with the applied ﬁeld, Ep1(R, θ, T ) is propagated with the velocity Ω1/K1 = c.
Ep1(R, θ, T ) is always opposite in direction to Ep1(R, θ, T ), as respectively plotted by
the shaded and unshaded sinusoidal curves in the XZ-plane in Figure 1.

II Radiation energy. Relevant basic equations

Similarly as in [1], we shall refer to the oscillatory electric charge qi (called a vaculeon
in the case of an elementary charge) and oscillatory mechanical energy Ei as a whole as
a particle, i; i = 1 and 2 here. The given charge oscillation pertains then to the internal
process of particle i. The radiation ﬁelds and the corresponding electromagnetic waves
follow accordingly to be the internal processes of the given particle, and are therefore the
component ﬁelds and (normal mode) waves of the particle. As a fundamental equation of
quantum mechanics, the electromagnetic waves from charge i, as represented by the ﬁeld
variables of (2)–(3) with a (normal mode) angular frequency Ωi, have a total wave energy

2π¯h being Planck constant. Given the waves being the components of the particle, Ei of (5)
thus amounts in turn to (here all of) the internal energy, and thus the total rest energy of
the particle. From Einstein’s mass energy equivalence postulate, Ei is furthermore related
to the particle’s rest mass Mi by

Ei = ¯hΩi,

Ei = Mic2

(5)

(6)

Ω2

In a systematic theoretical representation (5)–(6) are directly given as Newtonian-
Maxwellian solutions for particle formation [2]. Eliminating now Ei between (6) and
(5), putting here i = 1. we have ¯hΩ1 = M1c2. Taking squares on both sides we get an
equation to be used later:

1 c4
M 2
¯h2
The well established mechanical scheme for the generation of electromagnetic waves
implies an inevitable direct correspondence between the alternating ﬁeld E(R, θ, T ) and
the mechanical displacement of the charge uq1(T ) = Aq1 sin(Ωq1T ) expressed earlier. In
complete analogy to this correspondence for the source, we can represent, only formally
in this paper, the ﬁeld oscillation with the mechanical oscillation of a corresponding
non-absorbing elastic medium of volume mass density ρ0, composed of coupled oscillators
spaced b apart, of an eﬀective mass dMϕ = ρ0bR2 sin θdθdφ and displacement u1(R, θ, T ) =

Thereby, we can further utilize the standard result for mechanical wave energy, which
for per oscillator is dE1(R, θ, ϕ) = 1

Γ1
total wave energy is given by integrating dE1(R, θ, ϕ) over 4π solid angle and scale the
one-oscillator energy by a factor Lϕ/b to the energy of total chain of length Lϕ: E1 =

where 1/4π is a normalization factor, resulting from averaging the total energy of the
oscillatory charge over all possible oscillation directions of a solid angle 4π as noted earlier.
As (8) shows E1 is R-independent; this is also easy to appreciate conceptually, since
the total energy ﬂux in a non-absorbing medium is a constant. Physically, (8) expresses
that the total energy ﬂux is transmitted in a volume of the medium of total mass Mϕ,
Mϕ = Lϕρl as in (8). With Lϕ being as deﬁned earlier the total eﬀective length for
the wave path, ρl = sρ0 represents accordingly the linear mass density and s the cross
sectional area of the medium along the wave path, which is apparently an linear chain.
Propagated across this chain is eﬀectively a plane wave. (See [2] for a systematic account).
Eliminating now E1 between (8) and (6) we get another equation to be used later

III Exact equation for the RDM Lorentz force

According to Coulomb’s law the radiation depolarization ﬁeld of charge 1, Ep1(R, θ, T )

of (4), acts on charge q2 an electrostatic force

Fp12(R, θ, T ) drives in turn particle 2 into motion at a velocity v2(T ) according to New-
ton’s second law:

Fp12(R2, T ), accordingly v2, is in the direction of −Ep1 for q2 < 0 (Figure 1), and in
reversed direction for q2 > 0. Eliminating Fp12(R, θ, T ) between (11) and (10) gives the
ﬁnal equation of motion of particle 2:

Fp12(R, θ, T ) = q2Ep1(R, θ, T )

Fp12(R, θ, T ) = M2

dv2

q2Ep1(R, θ, T ) = M2

The total force on particle 2 acted by particle 1 accumulated during time interval ∆T , or
the momentum transmitted from particle 1 to particle 2 during ∆T under the action of
the radiation depolarization ﬁeld of particle 1, is

∆T q2Ep1 = M2

Figure 1: The mutual RDM Lorentz forces, Fm12 and Fm21 acting between two oscillatory
charges q1 and q2, being both < 0 in the illustration, and of masses M1 and M2. As shown
in the graph q1 owing to its oscillation produces at R2 a radiation electric ﬁeld E1, and
a radiation depolarization ﬁeld Ep1, pointing in +Z- and −Z-directions respectively. Ep1
acts on q2 a Coulomb force q2Ep1 and drives it into motion at velocity v2 in +Z-direction.
The now moving charge q2 in the magnetic ﬁeld B1 in turn is subject to a RDM Lorentz
force Fm12, with a direction given by the right hand rule: Turn the four ﬁngers of the
right hand from v2 to B1, the thumb points then to the direction of the Lorentz force on a
positive charge, and to the opposite, −X-direction direction for the actually q2 < 0 here.
In other words, Fm12 points from M2 to M1, and is an attractive force. Inset (a) shows
the wave path l making an angle θ at the Z-axis along which the oscillation is oriented.
Inset (b) shows the applied ﬁeld Eq∗1 in free space (deﬁned in the text) in relation to de
polarization ﬁeld Ep1.

Finally according to Lorentz force law, the moving charge q2 with a veloicty v2 as
expressed by (13) is in the magnetic ﬁeld B1(R, θ, T ) of (3) subject to a Lorentz magnetic
force:

Fm12(R, θ, T ) = q2v2(R, θ, ∆T ) × B1(R, θ, T ).

(14)

In characterizing the ﬁelds involved, we may call Fm12 the radiation depolarization-ﬁeld
and (radiation) magnetic-ﬁeld, RDM, resultant Lorentz force. Fm12(R, T ) is pointed in
the direction of the normal of the plane containing v2 and B1 for q2 > 0, and in the
reversed direction for q2 < 0 (as in Figure 1). The direction of Fm12 may be determined
directly using the right hand rule as illustrated in Figure 1 caption. One can examine
the direction of the force by assigning to the charges diﬀerent signs and placing them
at diﬀerent locations relative to the wave from the other charge. One will ﬁnd that,
irrespective of the sings of the charges as well as the charges’ locations relative to the

5

q
wave from the source charge, the RDM Lorentz force acting here by charge 2 on charge 1
is always attractive. An always attractive RDM Lorentz force is also expected from the
fact that the depolarization ﬁeld is always opposite in direction to the radiation electric
ﬁeld, the latter and the common radiation magnetic ﬁeld comprise an always repulsive
radiation force.

Now substituting into (14) with (13) for v2 and (3) for B1(R, θ, T ), and in turn with

(2) for E1(R, θ, T ), we have:

Equation (a) may be simpliﬁed and substituted with the particles’ masses for the

Besides, Ω2
1 of (a) alone is related to M1 by (7). Furthermore, as an elementary consid-
eration here we take q1 and q2 to be elementary charges1: q1, q2 = +e or − e; for their
appearance in (a):

Finally, we here restrict ourselves to point charges. Consider generally say charge 2 is
described as having a ﬁnite size of a cross sectional area s2 = Rd
Ω facing a solid angle
Ω = 1, dθ = dφ = sin θ = 1, and
Ω = sin θdθdφ; then it being a point formally implies d

(17)

The minus sign on the right hand side of (17), in front of an always positive quantity,
indicates Fm12(R, T ) is always pointed from charge 2 toward charge 1, and is thus always
attractive force, agreeing with our earlier vector analysis.

We can likewise regard particle 2 as the source charge and particle 1 as the test charge;
swapping the parameters for the two charges, and going through similar derivations as
above, we get the RDM Lorentz force acted by particle 2 on particle 1:

Fm21(R, T ) = −Fm12(R, T )

8πX µ2

(4π)2ρl¯h2M1

R2 sin2(Ω2T + K2R + α2) ˆX

(18)

Similarly from inspecting all possible signs and relative locations of the charges, one can
readily verify that, Fm21 is always directed from mass 1 toward mass 2, and is therefore
always an attractive force. Besides an otherwise complete analogy of (18) with (17), the
source charge 2 of (18) here involves an initial phase α2 which is uncorrelated with α1 of
source charge 1, with a1 and α2 being both statistical variables.

Fm12(R, T ) and Fm21(R, T ) are mutual (attractive) forces acting on one another be-
tween particles 1 and 2 simultaneously. In the course of action the two forces vary with
time and location (the latter variation may for example result if the particles are in
motion), each posing to the other particle with a random initial phase α1 or α2, and
accordingly a random instantaneous phase Ω1T − K1R + α1 or Ω2T + K2R + α2. Thus
Fm12(R, T ) and Fm21(R, T ) are statistical variables. Hence, the mutual RDM Lorentz
force between masses M1 and M2 is appropriately given by the geometric mean of the
two RDM Lorentz forces, denoted by Fg(R, T ); that is

Fg(R, T ) =

We are interested in the average of the mutual force in a meaningfully long time

Γ2. For the particle at a ﬁxed location R, K1R is a constant. Without loss of generality
we can put K1R = K2R = 0 (their dependence on a speciﬁc R value will be averaged oﬀ
by taking time average in a full time period.) The time average of the force is given by

As the time average of the geometry mean of two always attractive forces, Fg is always

[ρl][h]2 = m3 kg−1 s−2.

IV Discussion

First of all, the universal attractive RDM Lorentz force between two charges immersed
in a dielectric medium as predicted in this work pertains to a fundamental physical phe-
nomenon. Just restricted to this mere character, the exposition here and a prospective
experimental veriﬁcation of the RDM Lorentz attractive force appeal to a signiﬁcance in
physics. As a particular concern in the latter regard, it is remarked that since between
charged particles there would always simultaneously present a charge-charge Coulomb
force and radiation repulsive force, with the ﬁrst particularly being much greater in mag-
nitude, it would take a thoughtful design to experimentally detect the RDM Lorentz
force.

Secondly, although it is not intent to be proclaimed through this paper, it may how-
ever be projected as a mere conjecture until the assumption below is provided with a
justiﬁcation in overall respects (see further [2]), that if the vacuum is a dielectric medium,
then we are led to the following basic conclusions:

1). The RDM Lorentz force identiﬁes but with Newton’s gravitational force, the
deduction of Fg of (20)–(21) represents the Inference of Newton’s law of gravitation, and
(21) expresses in terms of all fundamental constants the exact universal gravitational
constant.

2). Substituting into (21) with the known values for the fundamental constants G,
µ0, e, c and ¯h, we can quantitatively estimate ρl/X = 2.8584 × 1024 kg/m. Suppose

8

the vacuum may be represented with coupled oscillators with a separation distance b of
the Planck length scale (see prediction in [2]), that is b ∼ 4 × 10−35 m, then each such
oscillator has a mass Mv = ρlb2 ∼ 10−10 kg, or, ∼ 106 J.

3). The radiation depolarization ﬁeld and the radiation magnetic ﬁeld say of particle 1,
Ep1(R, θ, T ) of (4)′ and B1(R, θ, T ) of (3), together make up a gravitational wave. Either
of the ﬁelds has a phase factor sin(Ω1T − K1R), yielding the velocity of the gravitational
wave to be

cg = dΩ1/dK1 = Ω1/K1 = c

(22)

c being the velocity of light as before.

Finally, the derivation of a universal gravitational force between two neutral bodies,
each being representable as a collection of charges of any signs, is mathematically straight-
forward. However a thorough conceptual elucidation will involve much of the properties
of the medium as well as the particle which can only be properly introduced through the
solution of equation of motion for these. See [2] for a detailed account.

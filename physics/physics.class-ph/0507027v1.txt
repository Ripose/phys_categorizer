REMARKS ON PHOTONS AND THE AETHER

ROBERT CARROLL
UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS, URBANA, IL 61801

Abstract. We expand upon some topics reviewed and sketched in
[15] with more details, embellishments, and some new material of a
speculative nature.

1. INTRODUCTION

In the book [15] we discussed many aspects of e.g. electromagnetism
(EM), the aether, and the Schr¨odinger equation (SE) partly in connection
with our study of the quantum potential (QP). We now want to examine
further the nature of photons and radiation in connection with a putative
aether. It is essential that we review some of the background from [15] in
order to motivate the aether treatment in Section 6.

2. PHOTONS

We begin with [92] (which is also sketched in [15] in a somewhat diﬀerent
manner) and in Section 5 give a related description following [28]. We
will also examine further various points of view concerning the massless
Klein-Gordon (KG) equation, the SE, the Maxwell equations (ME), and
the quantum vacuum. For background we mention here [6, 13, 15, 27, 32,
36, 37, 38, 41, 43, 44, 46, 51, 47, 48, 49, 50, 56, 57, 62, 63, 64, 65, 70, 74, 78,
79, 80, 85, 86, 87, 91]. One takes massless photons as objects with energy E,
P
momentum P, and internal angular momentum (or spin) S with E = c
|
|
and S
P = 0. It is presumed to have velocity c in the direction k and to
spin in a plane perpendicular to k, which is spanned by two vectors e and
b where

Note that the singular nature of D is really unacceptable in QM (e.g. be-
cause of the uncertainty principle) and one could conclude that the ﬁeld
strengths are not measurable quantities (cf. the ﬁrst paper in [92]). On
the other hand ﬁeld averages can be accepted in QM. This is one feature
leading to the approch in [92] based on the photon as fundamental. The
EM ﬁelds are considered essentially as a classical macroscopic ideas and
are not “basic”. Such an argument might be extendable quite generally to
cast suspicion on many results involving singular behavior or generalized
solutions of partial diﬀerential equations (distributions). The “classical”
theory might require e.g. averaging of dependent variables or some new
physics (not necessarily QM) in order to retain any meaning.

One looks next at the expectation values of ﬁelds in the quantum state
describing a system of photons. For the vacuum described via φ0 one has

(3.11)

< φ0, E(r, t)φ0 >=< φ0, B(r, t)φ0 >= 0

as expected. However one can show that e.g.

indicating that there are ﬂuctuations of the electric ﬁeld in vacuum. For
a quantum state of n photons in the same state with ﬁxed helicity and
momentum one has (cf. [92])
(3.13)

φ = φn(s1p1) =

(a†s1(p1))nφ0; < φ, E(r, t)φ >=< φ, B(r, t)φ >= 0

One concludes here that the EM ﬁeld of an indeﬁnite number of photons
all with the same helicity and momentum is a plane wave with circular
polarization. The quantum state where all photons are in the same one
photon state of ﬁxed helicity and momentum is a Bose-Einstein condensate
(?).

!

REMARK 2.1. We extract here from [74] for a few philosophical ob-
servations. The photon, as an elementary “particle” is unique; it is the
only elementary particle of energy. A relativistic energy equation should
be E2 = p2c2 + m0c2 = p2c2 since the rest mass m0 = 0.
In the frame
of the moving photon the photon’s energy is stored as rotational (spin)
energy where E = ~ν = ~c/λ with ν the frequency and λ the wave length.
Hence the greater the energy the smaller the wave length and one expects
to ﬁnd a lower bound for the wavelength. For a “particle” the angular
momentum is L = mrw limited by L = mrc and replacing L by the spin S
) ~ = mrc where m is a putative mass presumably “generated”
one has (
by the spin (see here also [92] for toy models with extended energy distri-
butions). Assume the concept of Schwartzschild radius R is valid for the
photon where for a black hole R = 2Gm/c2 or (
) (R/m) = (2G/c2). The
right side of (
) is a constant but for the photon the radius decreases as
the “mass” increases; hence there is a unique value of radius and mass for
) one
which a photon can behave as a black hole. Combining (
~c/2G for the Planck mass, which here is the maximum
ﬁnds ((cid:7)) m =
“pseudomass” permitted for the photon. This corresponds to a maximum
p
energy of mc2 = (
1022 MeV and the highest energy so
×
far observed for a photon is apparently less than this. It is suggested that
(cid:4)
pair production or photon “splitting” will ensue at the energy limit.

4. THE ZERO POINT FIELD - ZPF

This is a murky subject and essentially involves understanding the quan-
tum vacuum, which of course still retains some mysteries. We gave some
hesitant and heuristic comments on ZPF in [15], based on [13, 32, 47, 48, 49,
50, 56, 57, 70, 78, 79, 80, 85, 86], which upon hindsight seem woefully inade-
quate. Some of this is also summarized and enhanced in a recent paper [85]
(ﬁrst paper). However we go here to the lovely collection of papers by J.
Field (see e.g. [39, 40]) for an aper¸cu of basic physical connections between

REMARKS ON PHOTONS AND THE AETHER

QM, thermodynamics, and special relativity. This will serve as a com-
plement to Sections 2-3. We begin with [39] (ﬁrst paper) which in a sense
follows the spirit of Feynman’s QED where the fundamental concepts of QM
are explained in terms of the interactions of photons and electrons. One re-
((E/c), px, py, pz)
calls ﬁrst the energy momentum vector P = m(dX/dτ )
with X = (ct, x, y, z) and τ the proper time (time observed in the rest
frame). If the inertial frame S’ is moving with uniform velocity βc relative
to the frame S along the common x, x′ axis with 0y parallel to 0y′ then
the 4-vectors as observed in S, S’ are related by Lorentz transform (LT)
equations

As m
0 P is still well deﬁned so one has an energy momentum vector
say Pγ = [(Eγ/c), (Eγ /c)Cos(φ), (Eγ /c)Sin(φ), 0] for a photon of energy
Eγ moving in the (x, y) plane in a direction making an angle φ with the x
axis. A plane EM wave will be associated with a large number of photons
in general and for such a collection, all with the same 4-vector Pγ, one ﬁnds
from the LT equations an EM wave with

total energy). Using (4.1) the energies of
(here ν
the photons in the EM wave transform via E′γ = Eγγ(1
If
nγ is the total number of photons then ET = nγEγ which yields (4.2).
Further one sees immediately that Eγ/ν = E′γ/ν′ = constant and calling
this constant ~ one ﬁnds that Eγ = ~ν which identiﬁes ~ with Planck’s
constant. Consequently Planck’s constant arises from consistency between
the relativistic kinematics of photons, considered to be massless particles,
and the relativistic Doppler eﬀect for classical EM waves. Note also that
using λ = c/ν and Eγ = ~ν = pγc one arrives at the deBroglie relation
pγ = ~/λ = ~ν/c.

Now from the energy density of a plane EM wave, namely

(4.3)

ρW =

E2 + B2
8π

the photon interpretation gives immediately Poynting’s formula for the en-
ergy ﬂow F per unit area per unit time, namely F = cρW as well as the
formula for the radiation pressure Prad of a plane wave at normal incidence
on a perfect reﬂector, namely Prad = 2ρW . Note the number of photons
incident is F/Eγ per unit area per unit time so the total momentum trans-
ferred is then pγ(F/Eγ ) = F/c = ρW ; but a perfect reﬂector will not absorb
energy so an equal number of photons are re-emitted, yielding the factor

parallel to the positive x direction in the frame S, written as

The time averaged energy density per unit volume ¯ρW is ¯ρW = (E2
0 /8π) =
0 /8π) = (A2/8π). Assuming that the wave consists of a beam of photons
(H 2
of energy ~ν the average number density of photons ¯ργ in the wave is ¯ρW /~ν
so one gets ¯ργ = A2/8π~ν. This is the point where one now leaps across
the chasm separating the classical and quantum worlds. First the use of
a complex exponential to represent a classical EM wave is convenient but
it is really the real or imaginary parts that come into play (Cosines and
Sines); for QM the complex exponential is mandatory. Second one uses the
deﬁnition of wavelength together with Eγ = ~ν and pγ = ~/λ to replace in
the complex exponential the wave parameter λ by the particle parameters
Eγ and pγ. The parameter c is part of both descriptions (photons and EM
waves) and this leads to the complex exponential describing photons in the

This equation is then a bridge back across the chasm from QM to the classi-
cal world (cf. (4.5)). Just as the quantum wave function is only meaningful
in the limit of very low photon density so the function χ is meaningful only
in the limit of high photon density. χ is not an eigenfunction of either Eγ
or pγ and is a real function. The time average of χ2 is 1/2 the mean photon
density ¯ργ and ¯ρW = ~ν ¯ργ.
In a typical situation ¯ργ∆V is much larger
than 1 and no probabilistic meaning can be attached to it.

We show next following [39] how to derive the Maxwell equations using
only Coulomb’s inverse square law, special relativity, and Hamilton’s prin-
ciple. Thus take two objects Oi of masses mi and electric charges qi with no
external forces. The spatial distance separating them in the common center

where r = r12. The Maxwell equations can be derived immediately from
(4.12) along with the Faraday-Lenz law, Ampere’s law, etc. (cf.
[39] for
details).

Now concerning the ZPF we collect some background information as

follows.

(1) It seems well established that there is a unique Lorentz invariant
spectral energy density in the EM vacuum of the form ρ(ω) =
ρ0(ω) = ~ω2/2π2c3 (cf. [13, 70]). An observer moving with constant
velocity in the EM vacuum perceives no force.

∼

(2) Following [30, 94] an object undergoing uniform constant accelera-
tion a in the vacuum perceives himself to be immersed in a thermal
bath at temperature T = ~a/2πkc (k

Boltzman constant).

(3) One recalls also that there is a zero point energy (1/2)~ω attached to
a quantum harmonic oscillator. Also since there are (ω2/2π2c3)dω
ﬁeld nodes per unit volume in the frequency interval [ω, ω + dω] one
obtains the spectral density ρ0(ω) = ~ω4/2π2c3 of Item 1 (cf. [70]).
(4) In [13] one derives the Planck radiation law for the blackbody spec-
trum without the formalism of quantum theory. It is assumed only
that (i) There is classical, homogeneous, and ﬂuctuating EM EM
radiation at absolute zero with Lorentz invariant spectrum.
(ii)
Classical EM theory holds for a dipole oscillator. (iii) A free par-
ticle in equilibrium with blackbody radiation has classical kinetic
energy (1/2)kT per degree of freedom. This leads then to the zero
point energy density shown above and to Planck’s formula

Here (the quantum number) ~ arises in (4.14) as a linear factor in
calculating the Lorentz invariant spectral density and can later be
identiﬁed with Planck’s constant (so the derivation is classical).
(5) Going again to [13] one ﬁnds a lovely discussion involving entropy
and energy ﬂuctuations following and modifying Einstein’s argu-
ments. Thus one considers a cavity containing thermal radiation
separated into large and small volumes V and
of
EM radiantion in
between frequencies ω and ω + dω undergoes
spontaneous ﬂuctuations creating a change in the corresponding en-
tropy. Let Σ (resp. S) be the entropy contributed between ω and

5. MORE ON PHOTONS

We go here to [9, 10, 11, 28, 42, 54, 55, 67, 89] for some interesting de-
velopments concerning the localization of photons and their structure. One
knows of course that the methods of quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) work for
a description of photon activity but we want to examine more direct con-
nections to EM ﬁelds, Maxwell’s equations, and wave-particle duality. First
from [89] one argues that a photon wave function can be introduced if one
is willing to redeﬁne in a physically meaningful manner what one wishes to
mean by such a wave function. First one introduces a naive single photon

12

ROBERT CARROLL UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS, URBANA, IL 61801

wave function. Then one produces a second quantized many photon theory
approached via many particle physics (which will correspond to the quanti-
zation of the free radiation ﬁeld) and then recovers the naive single photon
wave function by looking at the manifold of one photon states. There are
apparently connections to the work of [11] to which we don’t have access
at the moment.

Now photons can be of positive or negative helicity and being massless
p
one has E = cp where p =
. If one introduces probability amplitudes for
|

(p, t) which would be ex-
photons of momentum p and helicity

Next for each p introduce two unit vectors ˆei(ˆp) where ˆp = p/

There is then a temptation to try and identify the Φ
as position represen-
tation probability amplitudes for photons of positive or negative helicity
or perhaps their sum Φ+ + Φ
as a position representation of a photon.
However photons are not localizable so this doesn’t work. One way around
[61]) is to show that an operator representating the number of pho-
(cf.
tons in an arbitrary volume V can be deﬁned but not as the integral over
V of a photon density operator. Another approach (cf.
[68]) is to deter-
mine an operator representing the number of photons in a volume V as the
integral over V of a so called detection operator which (when the linear

±

dimensions of V are large compared to the photon wavelengths) leads to
a simple formula for the probability that n photons are present in V (cf.
also [28] and Section 5.1 for coarse grained photon density and current den-
sity operators). Here one proceeds diﬀerently following [89] and looks for a
probability amplitude for the photon energy to be detected about dr of r

Note here that p (the usual photon momentum) and r, the position as-
sociated with the photon energy, are not conjugate variables. One then
builds up a QFT of of the free radiation ﬁeld via many particle physics
(not from a canonical formulation of the EM ﬁelds) and this is equiva-
lent to standard canonical quantization. Moreover upon specializing to one
above are recovered. Thus it is reasonable
photon the energy functions Ψ
to describe the single photon energy distribution in a region dr about r
via Ψ∗(r, t)
Ψ(r, t)dr. Further it is shown that in a spontaneous emission
process the wave function Ψ(r, t) generated is a causal ﬁeld, propagating
out from the emitting atom at the speed of light.

Now one goes to [54, 55] where the Bohr photon having a speciﬁc size
and shape is discussed. This involves a circularly polarized photon being
a monochromatic EM traveling wave conﬁned within a circular ellipsoid of
length equal to the wavelength (λ) and diameter λ/π propagating along the
long axis of the ellipsoid. In this model the quantization of the photon’s
angular momentum (corresponding to spin ~) arises from an appropriately
chosen of Maxwell’s equations and the energy is quantized to be ~ν. In
a sense, not entirely clear (cf.
[22]), one can think here of an ellipsoidal
soliton arising from the imposition of causality upon the solution of the
linear Maxwell equations where EM energy E2 + H2 integrated over the
volume of the ellipsoid equals ~ν leading to an average intensity within the
photon-soliton of Ip = 4π~c2/λ4. The word wavicle is also used in [55]. For
a wave traveling with the speed of light parallel to the z-axis the solution

of Maxwell’s equations can be any function of z

Imposing causality leads to the result that if A or B is zero then the ﬁeld
must be contained within a circular ellipsoid of length λ and cross sectional

diameter λ/π (cf.
the energy E2 + H2 and the 1/r term is then discarded to preserve the
ellipsoidal shape; there results A2 + B2 = 1 and α2 = 120h~cπ44/ǫ0λ6 (in

5.1. PHOTON DYNAMICS. We sketch here from [29] where it is shown
that one can deﬁne the notions of photon density and photon current den-
sity with certain limits. As a trivial example think of geometrical optics
where light is treated as an ensemble of point photons moving along deﬁ-
nite trajectories with speed c. In the geometric limit the photon number
density and current density are perfectly well deﬁned as are the density
and current density for any collection of point particles. As a second ex-
ample one refers to [68] where Mandel deﬁnes an operator nV representing
the number of photons in V as the integral over V of the photon density

is the so-called detection operator (here ~ǫ, a, and ω = ck are respectively
the polarization unit vector, the annihilation operator and the frequency
of a transverse photon of wave vector k and polarization λ (= 1, 2) with
L3 the quantization volume). It is shown that when the linear dimensions
of V are large compared to the photon wavelengths this deﬁnitiion of nV
yields a simple for the probability pV (n) that n photons are present in V.
It was later shown by Amrein [4] that nV agrees with that derived from
the theory of [61] and this all has motivated the study in [29] that a coarse
grained photon density operator can exist even though a ﬁne grained or
microscopic one may not.

absorption and emission). These will be deﬁned in terms of vector ﬁeld
operators ~ψ(x) and ~φ(x) which will be referred to as the photon ﬁeld (cf.
here also Section 2 again). For a volume V large compared to the photon
wavelengths D(x) will correctly predict the number statistics of photons
in that volume while for a time interval [t, t + T ] long compared to λ/c
C(x) correctly predicts the statistics of the number of photons that cross
the surface S in time T. This was worked out in the ﬁrst paper of [28]
for a discrete situation and is redone in the second paper in a continuum
context; we sketch this here for the free ﬁeld case and, following [28], show
that photon dynamics is a relativistically covariant theory. Thus write

6. SOME SPECULATIONS ON THE AETHER

The aether has been reviewed in [15, 21] to a certain extent and in [15]
some speculations were advanced concerning a possible geometry for the
aether. These were based on work of [1, 5, 7, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 34,
35, 59, 95] and we sketch here some variations and embellishments. First
we note from (5.15) that the components ψi and φi satisfy the massless
KG equation so for analysis of photons one needs 6 components (ψi, φi)
each satisfying a massless KG equation. However the equations (5.15) are
exactly the same as the Maxwell equations (3.7) so one could also imagine
introducing a vector Ψ = (
Ψν,µ to generate the
photon equations for a free ﬁeld with 2Ψ = 0 (see e.g. [82]). In this spirit
then one would have a 4-vector Ψ satisfying the massless KG equation to
serve as a generator of photon activity. In any event we will think of ﬁelds
labeled ψi for i = 0, 1, 2, 3 as characterizing photon dynamics with each
component satisfying the massless KG equation. Then we will apply the
machinery of (x, ψ) duality of Faraggi-Matone and Vancea (see especially
[34, 95]) to express the coordinates xµ in terms of the ﬁelds ψi arising from
Ψ (which will be called aether ﬁelds); they are seen to be “potential” ﬁelds
for the photon ﬁelds ψi, φi of Section 5.1.

As background here we refer to a lovely paper [59] of P. Isaev where he
makes conjectures, with supporting arguments, which arrive at a deﬁnition
of the aether as a Bose-Einstein condensate of neutrino-antineutrino pairs
of Cooper type (Bose-Einstein condensates of various types have been con-
sidered by others in this context - cf.
[25, 33, 60]). The equation for the
ψ-aether is then a solution of the massless Klein-Gordon (KG) equation
(photon equation) (~2∆
t )ψ = 0. This ψ ﬁeld heuristically acts
as a carrier of waves (playground for waves) and one might say that special
relativity (SR) is a way of including the inﬂuence of the aether on physical
processes and consequently SR does not see the aether (cf. here also the
idea of a Dirac aether in [23, 24, 31, 76] and Einstein-aether theories as
in [33, 60] - this is discussed further in [15]). In the electromagnetic (EM)
theory in [59] one looks at ~ψ = (φ, ~A) with 2ψi = 0 as the deﬁning equa-
tion for a real ψ-aether, in terms of the potentials φ and ~A which therefore
deﬁne the ψ-aether. EM waves are then considered as oscillations of the ψ
aether and wave processes in the aether accompanying a moving particle
determine wave properties of the particle. Interesting examples involving
standing EM waves in a spherical resonator are attributed to oscillations of
the ψ aether and references to superconductivity `a la Volovik [96, 97] are

In [34] Faraggi and Matone develop a theory of x

ψ duality, related to
Seiberg-Witten theory in the string arena, which was expanded in various
ways in [1, 5, 7, 16, 18, 19, 69, 95]. Here one works from a stationary SE
(~2/2m)∆ + V (x)]ψ = Eψ, and, assuming for convenience one space di-
[
−
mension, the space variable x is determined by the wave function ψ from
a prepotential F via Legendre transformations. The theory suggests that
x plays the role of a macroscopic variable for a statistical system with a
scaling term involving ~. Thus deﬁne a prepotential FE(ψ) = F(ψ) such
that the dual variable ψD = ∂F/∂ψ is a (linearly independent) solution
of the same SE. Take V and E real so that ¯ψ = ψD qualiﬁes and write
∂xF = ψD∂xψ = (1/2)[∂x(ψψD) + W )] where W is the Wronskian. This
leads to (ψD = ¯ψ) the relation F = (1/2)ψ ¯ψ + (W/2)x (setting the integra-
2i√2m/~ one obtains
tion constant to zero). Consequently, scaling W to

In particular one has

uum and refer to the bibliography for other references. We sketch ﬁrst
some material from [1, 5, 7, 95] which extends the SE theory to the Klein-
Gordon (KG) equation. Following [95] take a spacetime manifold M with
a metric ﬁeld g and a scalar ﬁeld ψ satisfying the KG equation. Locally

THEOREM 6.1. The formulas (6.14), (6.15), (6.16), (6.17), (6.18), and
(6.19), and their continuations determine a geometry for a putative aether,
expressed in terms of our so-called aether ﬁelds ψi.

−

REMARK 1.1. These matters are taken up again in [5] for a general
curved spacetime and some suﬃcient constraints are isolated which make
the theory work. Also in both papers a quantized version of the KG equa-
tion is also treated and the relevant x
ψ duality is spelled out in operator
form. We omit this also in remarking that the main feature here for our
purposes is the fact that one can describe spacetime geometry (at least
locally) in terms of (ﬁeld) solutions of a KG equation and prepotentials
(which are themselves functions of the ﬁelds). In other words the coordi-
nates are programmed by ﬁelds and if the motion of some particle of mass
m is involved then its coordinates are choreographed by the ﬁelds with a
quantum potential eventually entering the picture via (6.7). In [1] a similar
duality is worked out for the Dirac ﬁeld and cartesian coordinates and to
connect this with the aether idea one should examine such formulas for

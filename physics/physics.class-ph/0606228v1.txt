Abstract

We discuss the seminal article in which Le Bellac and L´evy-Leblond have
identiﬁed two Galilean limits of electromagnetism [1], and its modern implica-
tions. Recent works have shed a new light on the choice of gauge conditions in
classical electromagnetism. We discuss various applications and experiments,
such as in quantum mechanics, superconductivity, electrodynamics of contin-
uous media, etc. Much of the current technology, where waves are not taken
into account, is actually based on Galilean electromagnetism.

Key words: Galilean covariance, special relativity, electromagnetism, four-potential.

1 Introduction

The purpose of this article is to emphasize the relevance of ‘Galilean electromag-
netism’, recognized in 1973 by Michel Le Bellac and Jean-Marc L´evy-Leblond (LBLL).
They observed that there exist not only one, but two well-deﬁned Galilean limits
of electromagnetism:
the so-called ‘magnetic’ and ‘electric’ limits [1]. Hereafter,
‘Galilean’ means that the theory satisﬁes the principle of relativity in its Galilean
form (also referred to as the sometimes misleading term ‘non-relativistic’).

Our purpose is not to argue that these limits should be seen as alternatives to
Lorentz-covariant electrodynamics. We wish to point out that some physical phe-
nomena, often described with special relativity, can be explained by properly deﬁned
Galilean limits. In other words, such phenomena could have been understood without
recourse to special relativity, had the Galilean limits of electrodynamics been correctly
deﬁned in the ﬁrst place. Therefore, our general purpose is twofold: ﬁrst, that one
must be careful when investigating alleged ‘non-relativistic’ limits, and second, that
well-deﬁned Galilei-covariant theories might allow one to describe more physical phe-
nomena than usually believed. The later point means that some concepts, which are
thought to be ‘purely relativistic’, can actually be understood within the realm of
Galilean physics. A dramatic such example is the concept of spin [2].

We have summarized and discussed various approaches to Galilean electromag-
netism in a recent article [3]. Since then, we have learned the existence of several
studies emphasing the applications of quasistatic regimes both in research like, for
example, in micro-electronics [4], bio-systems engineering, medical engineering, elec-
tromagnetic computations [5] and teaching [6].

Now let us brieﬂy review Galilean electromagnetism and set up the main equations
that we are going to utilize later on. A Lorentz transformation acts on space-time
coordinates as follows:

Since Galilean kinematics involves the time-like condition

there is no other possible limit than the one given in Eq. (2). As we shall see below,
this is not the same for transformations of electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

However, it is not a valid transformation; in particular, it does not even satisfy the
group composition law [1].) However, Eq. (4) allows us to obtain, in addition to
Eq. (5), another perfectly well-deﬁned Galilean limit. In order to do so, one must
compare the modules of the electric ﬁeld E and the magnetic ﬁeld cB, in analogy
with Eq. (3). For large magnetic ﬁelds, Eq. (4) reduces to the so-called magnetic
limit of electromagnetism:

Indeed, the approximations Ee/c >> Be and v << c together imply that Ee/v >>

Since we will emphasize the use of scalar and vector potentials (V, A), let us
consider their transformation properties. Under a Lorentz transformation, Eq. (1),
they become

Whereas there exists only one possible condition, Eq. (3), for the space-time manifold,
here we ﬁnd a second limit, obtained by v << c and A >> cV , such that Eq. (9)

Hereafter, we illustrate some applications of the Galilean electrodynamics of mov-
ing bodies. In the next section, we reexamine the gauge conditions and their com-
patibility with Lorentz and Galilean covariance. Then we comment brieﬂy on the
connection between the two limits and the Faraday tensor (and its dual). In Section
4, we discuss Feynman’s proof of (the magnetic limit of) the Maxwell equations, and
Section 5 contains a few comments about superconductivity seen as a magnetic limit,
and gauge potentials. In Sections 6 and 7, we question our current understanding of
the electrodynamics of moving bodies by examining the Trouton-Noble experiment
in a Galilean context as well the introductory example used by Einstein in his famous
work on special relativity. We conclude with some comments on the intrinsic use by
Maxwell of both limits, one century before LBLL.

2 Gauge conditions and Galilean electromagnetism

Hereafter, we use the Riemann-Lorenz formulation of classical electromagnetism (i.e.
in terms of scalar and vector potentials instead of ﬁelds [7]) to describe the two
Galilean limits. Let us recall how the electric and magnetic limits may be retrieved
in this formulation by a careful consideration of orders of magnitude [8, 3]. It is quite
natural to deﬁne the following dimensionless parameters:

L
cT

ε

≡

and

j
cρ

,

ξ

≡

where L, T , j and ρ represent the orders of magnitude of length, time, current density,
and charge density, respectively.

The equations of classical electromagnetism, written in terms of potentials, are

cast into the following form [7]:

from which we can deﬁne a further dimensionless ratio, cA

V ≃

ξ.

This echoes LBLL’s prescription for the ﬁelds [1]: in the magnetic limit, the spacelike
quantity cA is dominant, whereas in the electric limit, it is the timelike quantity V
that dominates.

The deﬁnition E =

V of the electric ﬁeld takes diﬀerent forms in the
Galilean limits, depending on the order of magnitude of each term, because the
Galilean transformations for the potentials diﬀer for the electric and the magnetic
limits [1]. Let us evaluate the order of magnitude of the ratio between its two terms:

which ξ << 1, we can neglect ∂tA, so that we obtain Eq. (11). The curl of this
expression leads to

0.

The choice of gauge conditions allows one to retrieve the two sets of Galilean
Maxwell equations in terms of ﬁelds, as stated by LBLL [1]. Moreover, as we now
proceed to show, the gauge conditions are closely related to the nature of kinematic
transformations. In the magnetic limit, the condition ξ >> 1 leads to the Coulomb
Am = 0. From the deﬁnition of Bm together with the identity

To summarize the preceding discussion, we point out forcefully that the choice of
a gauge condition is dictated by the relativistic versus Galilean nature of the problem.
The role of potentials and gauge conditions in quasistatic regimes was pointed out
only recently by Dirks [4] and Larsson [6], although the problem was not handled
correctly, as we have done with the Riemann-Lorenz formulation. Indeed, both of
them use the (erroneous) equation :

obtained by plunging the (magnetic Galilean-covariant: ξ >> 1) Coulomb gauge
condition into the full set of (Lorentz-covariant:ξ
1) Maxwell equations in terms of

the ﬁelds without remarking that the temporal terms are negligible with respect to
the spatial terms as ǫ << 1...

The Lorenz gauge condition is compatible with the relativistic context as well as
the electric Galilean limit. The Coulomb gauge condition, however, is compatible with
the Galilean magnetic limit only because it is not covariant with respect to neither
the Lorentz transformations nor the Galilean electric transformations. We refer the
interested reader to a discussion of the physical meaning that one can ascribe to the
various ‘gauge conditions’ [9].

Galilean electromagnetism sheds a new light on the pre-relativity era. Indeed, a
careful reading of James Clerk Maxwell’s famous Treatise on Electricity and Mag-
netism reveals that he was actually working with the electric limit in the discussion
of dielectric materials in his ﬁrst volume (see Chapters II to V) [10]. Likewise, in his
treatment of ohmic conductors and induced magnetic ﬁelds, in his second volume,
the magnetic limit was employed implicitly, except in the chapters on the theory
of light propagation, where he introduced ‘by hand’ the displacement current term
into the magnetic limit equations in order to demonstrate that light is a transverse
electromagnetic wave [10]. But, as we have seen in the particular case of the electric
limit (and it is also valid in relativity), the displacement current follows from choos-
ing the Lorenz gauge, and Maxwell (wrongfully) kept the Coulomb gauge within the
relativistic context for the ﬁelds (for more details, see the forthcoming [11]). This
problem prompted Hertz and Heaviside to relinquish potentials and to rather cast
the Maxwell equations in terms of ﬁelds. Following Hertz’s approach, Einstein subse-
quently expressed the Maxwell equations in terms of ﬁelds (i.e. in the Heaviside-Hertz
formulation), whereas Henri Poincar´e wrote the Maxwell equations in terms of the
potentials (i.e. the Riemann-Lorenz formulation) by adopting the Lorenz condition
in a relativistic context [11].

3 The Faraday tensor and its dual

In special relativity, it is well known that the Faraday tensor:

Fµν ≡

∂µAν −

∂νAµ,

µ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3,

and its dual:

∗Fµν =

ǫµνρσFρσ,

1
2
do have the same physical meaning. This is not the case within Galilean electromag-
netism. As pointed out in Earman’s book, and recently discussed by Rynasiewicz, the
Galilean tranformations of the Faraday tensor and its dual tensor lead to the electric
or the magnetic limit, respectively [12]. The eﬀect of the duality operation amounts
to exchanging E and B:

E

cB and B

E/c.

→

→ −

6

One recovers the magnetic and electric limits, Eqs.
(7) and (8), by applying the
duality transformations directly to the electric transformations of the ﬁelds in order
to get the magnetic transformations, and vice versa.

Earman also noted [12] that the ﬁeld transformations of the magnetic limit are

obtained when E and B are expressed in terms of ‘covariant’, or

, tensor Fµν,

whereas the electric limit is obtained when the ﬁelds transformations are calculated

by using the ‘contravariant’, or

, tensor F µν. Let us illustrate it brieﬂy, with

4 Quantum mechanics with external potentials

In 1990, Dyson published a demonstration of the Maxwell equations due to Richard
Feynman [13]. The demonstration dates back to the forties and had remained hitherto
unpublished. It was believed to be incomplete because Feynman considered only the
homogeneous Maxwell equations, given by the ﬁrst two lines of Eq. (14):

E =

∂tB,

∇×

−

B = 0.

∇ ·

During the nineties, some authors revisited this demonstration and noted that the
Schr¨odinger equation admitted external potentials only if they were compatible with
the magnetic limit of LBLL and, therefore, with the Coulomb gauge condition (see
[14, 15] and references therein).

Indeed, from Eq. (16), it is clear that the homogeneous Maxwell equations given
above are valid only within the magnetic limit because the electric ﬁeld has zero
curl in the electric limit, Eq. (15). This is a consequence of the Galilean magnetic
limit of the four-potential which does enter into the Schr¨odinger equation. Let us
recall the statement more precisely (more details can be found in reference [14]). The
Schr¨odinger equation with external ﬁelds V (x, t) and A(x, t) is written as

i¯h∂tΨ(x, t) =

1
2m

(

i¯h

∇ −

A(x, t))2Ψ(x, t) + V (x, t)Ψ(x, t).

It is covariant under Galilean transformations, Eq. (2), with

where φ(x, t) is some scalar function. In the case φ(x, t) = 0, which corresponds to
pure Galilean boosts, the equations above reduce to the magnetic limit of Galilean
transformations of the potentials, Eq. (12). Hence, one can say that ‘Galilean covari-
ance selects the gauge’.

8

In a subsequent study, Holland and Brown have shown that the Maxwell equations
admit an electric limit only if the source is a Dirac current [16]. In addition, they
have shown that the Dirac equation admits both Galilean limits, just like the Maxwell
equations, corroborating thereby earlier results by L´evy-Leblond [2]. To summarize,
what Feynmann did not (actually, could not) realize is that he had derived only the
part of the Maxwell equations compatible with the Galilean covariant magnetic limit,
that is to say, the homogeneous equations.

5 Superconductivity

Superconductivity also enters into the realm of the magnetic limit; indeed, it selects
the Coulomb gauge condition as a necessary consequence of Galilean covariance. To
illustrate this, consider the London equation, which states that the current density is
proportional to the vector potential:

p = m∗v + q∗A = 0.

The star denotes a quantity describing Cooper pairs [17]. This implies that there is
a perfect transfer of electromagnetic momentum to kinetic momentum. Hence, con-
trary to what is usually stated, gauge invariance is not broken by superconductivity
since the Coulomb gauge condition is implied. Moreover, the Meissner eﬀect can be
B = µ0j, that is, without
explained by starting with Amp`ere’s equation written as
the displacement current term as in the magnetic case, third line of Eq. (16). Hence,
µ0j in the Riemann-Lorenz formulation)
this expression (or more directly
A = 0 and London equation, lead to solutions (in one dimension x)
together with
of the type A
λx (where λ is a constant) so that the vector potential (hence
exp
the magnetic ﬁeld) only penetrates the superconductor to a depth 1/λ [17].

the time derivative of the charge density is negligible with respect to the divergence
of the current [3].

As a consequence, superconductivity cannot be associated with a symmetry break-
ing of gauge invariance but is magnetic Galilean covariant. This unusual statement
has been recently advocated by Martin Greiter using a diﬀerent approach [18]. As a
matter of fact, it is the global U(1) phase rotation symmetry that is spontaneously
violated. A striking consequence is that the Higgs mechanism for providing mass
to particles becomes doubtful, since it was believed to be analogous to the assumed
symmetry breaking of gauge invariance in superconductivity.

6 Electrodynamics of continuous media at low ve-

locities

In 1904, Lorentz claimed that a moving magnet could become electrically polarized
[19]. In 1908, Einstein and Laub noted that the Minkowski transformations for the
ﬁelds and the excitations [20] predict that a moving magnetic dipole induces an
electric dipole moment [21]. It is interesting to reexamine these predictions in the
light of the Galilean electrodynamics of continuous media. Indeed if one starts from
the Minkowski transformations that relate the polarization and the magnetization
[20], one would expect two Galilean limits: one with M′ = M and P′ = P
M/c2
and the other with M′ = M + v

×
P and P′ = P (see Chapter 9 of Ref. [22]).

We can infer the following boundary conditions for moving media, with n being

surface charge, Σ the surface separating both media, and vn the projection of the
relative velocity on the normal of Σ:

Therefore, as we presumed, the eﬀects in continuous media predicted by Lorentz as

7 Electrodynamics of moving bodies at low veloc-

ities

Galilean electromagnetism raises doubts about our current understanding of the elec-
trodynamics of moving media. For instance, several experiments (like the ones by
Roentgen [23], Eichenwald [24], Wilson [25], Wilson and Wilson [26], Trouton and
Noble [27], etc.) are generally believed to corroborate special relativity. However,
as we will show hereafter for the Trouton-Noble experiment, there is not always a
need for special relativity because the typical relative velocity in these experiments is
much smaller than the speed of light. As we have emphasized previously, the Galilean
framework must involve the two limits of electromagnetism. A question that arises
is which of the experiments mentioned above can be explained by either the electric
limit, the magnetic limit or a coherent combination of both.

It is interesting to notice that Ernest Carvallo, a notorious anti-relativist, used
both quasistatic limits as early as 1921 in order to deny the success of Einstein’s theory
of relativity [28]. In some sense, he was right to point out that the electrodynamics of
moving bodies at low velocities could be described in a Galilean-covariant manner by
distinguishing the conductors and dielectrics. However, he was wrong to think that
the optical properties of moving bodies can be described along the same lines.

7.1 The Trouton-Noble experiment

The Trouton-Noble experiment can be thought of as the electromagnetic analogue of
the optical Michelson and Morley experiment [27]. It was designed to verify whether
one can observe a mechanical velocity of the ether if one considers the luminiferous
medium as having parts which can be followed mechanically. Like the Michelson-
Morley optical experiment, the Trouton-Noble experiment led to a negative results
in the sense that no one was able to detect either an absolute motion with respect to
the ether, or a partial entrainment like in Fizeau experiment.

In 1905, Albert Einstein suggested to consider the ether as superﬂuous, since
its mechanical motion was not detected experimentally. Some theorists, such as H.
Poincar´e and H.A. Lorentz, were reluctant to relinquish ether as the bearer of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, despite the fact that they had adopted the relativity principle.
In 1920, at a conference in Leyden, Einstein himself recoursed to ether as the medium
allowing the propagation of gravitational waves, although it cannot be endowed with
the characteristics of a material medium [29]. Today, even though the ether is a
banished word in modern science, one can use it as did the older Einstein in order to
describe the vacuum with physical (though not mechanical) properties.

Before the advent of special relativity, Hertz, Wien, Abraham, Lorentz, Cohn and
all the specialists of the electrodynamics of moving bodies have used the transforma-
tions given in Eq. (6), which is an incoherent mixture of the electric and magnetic
Galilean limits [30]. As mentioned previously, these expressions do not even obey the

11

group property of composition of transformations.

The purpose of the Trouton-Noble experiment was to observe the eﬀect of a
charged capacitor in motion with an angle θ between the plates and the motion
through the ether [27]. The electric ﬁeld in the reference frame of the capacitor
generates a magnetic ﬁeld in the ether frame given by

where v is the absolute velocity. Thus we have

Consequently, there is a localization of magnetic energy density inside a volume dV :

The volume of the capacitor being written as Sl, the total energy between the plates

If one denotes by V = E/l the diﬀerence of potential between the plates, then the

which is maximal for θ = 45◦, and zero for θ = 90◦. Hence, the plates are expected
to be perpendicular to the velocity. However, this eﬀect has not been observed ex-
perimentally.

In order to understand what is wrong with the above demonstration, let us ﬁrst
consider the electric limit transformation, given in Eq. (8). A consequence of this
transformation is that the Biot-Savart law follows from the Coulomb law associated
with the electric transformation of the magnetic ﬁeld. Contrary to the transformations
(6), used by Trouton and Noble [27], they do respect the group additivity. Besides,
these transformations are only compatible with the approximate set of the Maxwell
equations where the time derivative in the Faraday equation vanishes, as in Eq. (15).
We can derive the following ‘electric limit’ approximation of the Poynting theorem:

(25)

This shows that the energy density is of electric origin only. Hence, no electric energy
associated with the motional magnetic ﬁeld can be taken into account within the

12

electric limit, because it is of order (v/c)2 with respect to the static, or quasistatic,
electric one. Thus, the Trouton-Noble experiment does not show any eﬀect as soon
as we are in the realm of the electric limit. Recall that the electric limit is such that
the relative velocity is small compared to the velocity of light c, and the order of
magnitude of the electric ﬁeld is large compared to the product of c by the magnetic
ﬁeld. Of course, for larger velocities, special relativity is needed and we must take
into account the additional mechanical torque [31] due to the length variation in order
to explain the negative result (i.e. no torque).

In the very last paragraph of their 1903 article, Trouton and Noble comment on the
source of the negative result being caused by the fact that they considered the energy
of the motional magnetic ﬁeld [27]. They suggested that the energy of the magnetic
ﬁeld must have had some origin, and that the electrostatic energy of the capacitor
had to dimininish by 1/2ǫ0E2v2/c2 when it is moving with a velocity v at right angles
to its electrostatic lines of force (the electrostatic energy then being 1/2ǫ0E2). We
may assert that the converse situation of a solenoid or magnet in motion will not
create a motional magnetic torque because the magnetic energy associated with the
motional electric ﬁeld is negligible compared to the magnetic energy of the static, or
quasistatic, magnetic ﬁeld.

7.2

‘Einstein’s asymmetry’

In his famous article on the electrodynamics of moving media, Albert Einstein pointed
out the importance of whether or not one should ascribe energy to the ﬁelds when
dealing with motion [32]. In the introduction of his paper, he recalled that Maxwell’s
electrodynamics, when applied to moving bodies, leads to intrinsic theoretical asym-
metries. He illustrated it with the example of the reciprocal electrodynamic action of
a magnet and a conductor. Then, the observable phenomenon depends on the rela-
tive motion of the conductor and the magnet, unlike the traditional view advocated
by Lorentz in which either one or the other of these bodies is in motion: (1) if the
magnet is moving with the conductor at rest, an electric ﬁeld, with a certain deﬁnite
energy, is induced in the neighbourhood of the magnet, producing a current where
parts of the conductor are located; (2) if the conductor is in motion and the magnet at
rest, then no electric ﬁeld arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet. Lorentz there-
fore argued that the conductor must contain an electromotive force with no intrinsic
energy, but which causes electric currents similar to those produced by the electric
forces in the former case, assuming the same relative motion in the two cases. This
dual representation of the same phenomena was unbearable for Einstein.

By invoking the Lorentz transformation (obtained in the kinematical analysis of
his article) to the Maxwell equations (actually, Einstein used the Heaviside-Hertz
formulation, whereas Poincar´e used the Riemann-Lorenz formulation in his relativity
article [11]), Einstein replaced Lorentz’s explanation:

13

1. If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic ﬁeld, there acts
upon it, in addition to the electric force, an electromotive force which, if we neglect the
terms multiplied by the second and higher powers of v/c, is equal to the vector product
of the velocity of the charge and the magnetic force, divided by the velocity of light.[32]

by the now famous special relativity explanation, valid for all velocities:

2. If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic ﬁeld, the force
acting upon it is equal to the electric force which is present at the locality of the charge,
and which we ascertain by transformation of the ﬁeld to a system of co-ordinates at
rest relatively to the electrical charge.[32]

Einstein therefore concluded that the analogy is valid with magnetomotive forces,
based on the idea that the electromotive force is merely some auxiliary concept owing
its existence to the fact that the electric and magnetic forces are related to the relative
motion of the coordinate system. Then he pointed out that the asymmetry mentioned
in the introduction of his article now disappears.

We wish to point out forcefully that the transformations of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld given by the Galilean magnetic limit are suﬃcient to explain Einstein’s thought
experiment with the magnet and the conductor, without recourse to Lorentz covari-
ance [33]. Indeed, as in our discussion of the Trouton-Noble experiment, the magnetic
Poynting theorem can explain why one cannot ascribe an energy to the motional elec-
tric ﬁeld in Einstein’s thought experiment,

∂t

which is the magnetic analogue of Eq. (25).

It means that the second postulate (invariance of the velocity of light) used by
Einstein is not required in order to explain the thought experiment. The relativity
principle and the magnetic Galilean transformations are suﬃcient, together with the
fact that the relative velocity involved in such an experiment is much smaller than
the velocity of light. Hence, in the low-velocity regime, we proposed the following
explanation of Einstein’s asymmetry:

3.

If a unit electric point charge is in motion in an electromagnetic ﬁeld, the
force acting upon it is equal to the electric force which is present at the locality of the
charge, and which we ascertain by a Galilean magnetic transformation of the ﬁeld to
a system of co-ordinates at rest relatively to the electrical charge.

Einstein was correct in replacing Lorentz’s explanation because Lorentz thought
that the vector product of the velocity with the magnetic ﬁeld was not an electric
ﬁeld (which is why Lorentz called it the electromotive ﬁeld). But, because LBLL’s

14

article was not available yet, Einstein could not notice that the same vector product
was an eﬀective electric ﬁeld due to a transformation of the Galilean magnetic limit.
Wolfgang Pauli too oﬀered a solution to the asymmetry problem in his textbook
on electrodynamics, but he only assumed that his calculations were a ﬁrst order
approximation of the relativistic demonstration [34]. He did not acknowledge the
existence of the Galilean magnetic limit.

To summarize, Einstein’s explanation to remove the asymmetry is completely
valid. However, we have noticed above that special relativity is not necessary to
remove it, but only suﬃcient.
It is ironic that the thought experiment that led
Einstein to special relativity could have been explained by Galilean relativity if only
the magnetic limit had been known by him at that time.

As pointed out by Keswani and Kilminster [35], Maxwell did resolve Einstein’s
asymmetry within the formalism of the magnetic limit when he stated that for all
phenomena related to closed circuits and the current within them, the fact that the
coordinate system be at rest or not is immaterial. On p. 346 of the same paper, they
go on by explaining that the formula for the electromotive intensity (in its modern
sense and not in Lorentz sense above) is of the same type, whether the motion of
the conductors refers to ﬁxed axes or to moving axes, because the only diﬀerences is
that for moving axes the electric potential V becomes V ′ = V
A. Then they
recall that Maxwell claimed that whenever a current is produced within a circuit C,
ds, and the value of V therefore disappears
the ‘electromotive force’ is equal to

Concluding remarks

One century after the relativity revolution has taken place, and more than thirty years
after the work of L´evy-Leblond and Le Bellac, Galilean electromagnetism is becoming
a ﬁeld of current research, because it allows physicists and engineers to explain much
more simply low-energy experiments involving the electrodynamics of moving media
without the sophisticated formalism of special relativity.

In this paper, we have reexamined gauge conditions in connection with Lorentz
and Galilean covariance. After a brief comment on the two Galilean limits of electro-
magnetism and the Faraday tensor, we have recalled the importance of the magnetic
limit in ‘Feynman’s proof’ of the Maxwell equations as well as in superconductiv-
ity. Finally, we have questioned our current understanding of the electrodynamics of
moving bodies by examining the Trouton-Noble experiment and the example used by
Einstein in the introduction of his famous article on special relativity.

For slow velocities it is clear that eﬀects of special relativity, such as length con-
traction, cannot explain (as it was believed so far) the corresponding experiments
since these eﬀects are negligible.
In the realm of mechanics, one might ask what
would have happened if Newton were born after Einstein? We are in an analogous
situation with respect to electromagnetism.

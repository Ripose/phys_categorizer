Abstract

After the 1916 success of General relativity that explained grav-
ity by adding time as a fourth dimension, physicists have been trying
to explain other physical ﬁelds by adding extra dimensions.
In 1921,
Kaluza and Klein has shown that under certain conditions like cylindric-
ity (∂gij/∂x5 = 0), the addition of the 5th dimension can explain the
electromagnetic ﬁeld. The problem with this approach is that while the
model itself is geometric, conditions like cylindricity are not geometric.
This problem was partly solved by Einstein and Bergman who proposed,
in their 1938 paper, that the 5th dimension is compactiﬁed into a small
circle S1 so that in the resulting cylindric 5D space-time R4 × S1 the
dependence on x5 is not macroscopically noticeable. We show that if, in
all deﬁnitions of vectors, tensors, etc., we replace R4 with R4 × S1, then
conditions like cylindricity automatically follow – i.e., these conditions be-
come fully geometric.

1 Physics: 5D Geometry is Useful

After the 1916 success of A. Einstein, who explained gravitation by combining
space and time into a 4D space, there have been many eﬀorts to explain other
physical ﬁelds by adding other physical dimensions.

The ﬁrst successful attempt was made by Th. Kaluza and O. Klein in 1921.
They showed that if we formally consider the equations of general relativity
theory in the 5D space, the equations for the normal 4
4 components gij
of the metric tensor still describe gravitation, while the new components g5i
of the metric tensor satisfy Maxwell’s equations (under the assumption that

×

1

g55 = const). Thus, if we go to 5D space, we get a geometric interpretation of
electrodynamics.

The only problem with this interpretation is that it is formal: change in ﬁrst
4 dimensions makes perfect physical sense, while there seemed to be no physical
eﬀects corresponding to change in 5th dimension. To solve this problem, A.
Einstein and P. Bergmann proposed, in 1938 [Einstein and Bergmann 1938],
that the 5th dimension forms a tiny circle, so that only micro-particles “see” it,
while for us, the world is 4D.

This is a standard view now in particle physics; see, e.g., [Green et al. 1988,
Polchinski 1998]: space is 10- or 11-dimensional, all dimensions except the ﬁrst
four are tiny.

2 Formulas from Physical 5D Theories that
Need to Be Explained in Purely Geometric
Terms

In addition to a nice geometric model, the traditional description of Kaluza-
Klein theory requires several additional physical formulas, formulas that look
very artiﬁcial because they do not have a direct geometric explanation.

In this paper, we will show that, if we take the Einstein-Bergmann model
seriously, then these formulas can be derived – and thus, they are not additional
and ad hoc.

What are these formulas that do not directly follow from the geometric

model?

First, the assumption g55 = const is artiﬁcial.
Second, since only four coordinates have a physical sense, the distance ∆s2 =

∆xi

∆xj between the points x and x + ∆x should only depend on

Pi=1
the ﬁrst 4 coordinates – while in general, for a 5D metric, the terms g55 ·
and g5i

∆xi create a diﬃcult-to-explain dependence on ∆x5.
Third, we would like to explain the fact that the observed values of physical
ﬁelds do not depend on the ﬁfth coordinate x5, e.g., that ∂gij/∂x5 = 0 (this
condition is called cylindricity).

Several other formulas came from the attempts to give the ﬁfth dimension
a physical interpretation. Namely, in the 1940s, Yu. Rumer showed (see, e.g.,
[Rumer 1956]) that if we interpret x5 as action S =
L dx dt (i.e., the quantity
whose extrema deﬁne the ﬁeld’s dynamics), then the fact that x5 is deﬁned on
a circle is consistent with the fact that in quantum physics (e.g., in its Feynman
integral formulation), action is used only as part of the expression exp(iS/h),
h to S. (For a H atom, this
whose value is not changed if we add a constant 2π

idea leads to the original Bohr’s quantization rules.)

3 Natural Idea and Its Problems

The main diﬀerence between a standard 4D space and Einstein-Bergmann’s 5D
model is that we have a cylinder K = R4
S1 (K for Kaluza) instead of a linear
space. It is, therefore, desirable to modify standard geometry by substituting
K instead of R4 into all deﬁnitions.

×

The problem with this idea is that the corresponding formalisms of diﬀer-
ential geometry use the underlying linear space structure, i.e., addition and
multiplication by a scalar. We still have addition in K, but multiplication is
not uniquely deﬁned for angle-valued variables: we can always interpret an an-
2π while
gle as a real number modulo the circumference, but then, e.g., 0

of all possible real numbers that correspond to the given angle.

We do need a real-number representation of an angle variable. A more natural
representation of this variable is not as a single real number, but as a set

Similarly to interval and fuzzy arithmetic, we can naturally deﬁne element-
wise arithmetic operations on such sets, e.g., A + B =

can then deﬁne tensors as linear mappings that preserve the structure of such
sets, and we can deﬁne a diﬀerentiable tensor ﬁeld as a ﬁeld for which the set
of all possible values of the corresponding partial derivatives is also consistent
with the basic structure.

5 Resulting Formalism: Idea

In mathematical terms, the resulting formalism is equivalent to the following:
We start with the space K which is not a vector space (only an Abelian group).
We reformulate standard deﬁnitions of vector and tensor algebra and tensor
analysis and apply them to K: K-vectors are deﬁned as elements of K; K-
covectors as elements of the dual group, etc. All physically motivated conditions
turn out to be natural consequences of this formalism.

6 K-Vectors

In the traditional 4-D space-time R4, we can deﬁne a vector as simply an element
In our case, instead of 4-D space-time R4, we have a 5-D space-time
of R4.
K def= R4
S1, in which S1 is a circle of a small circumference h > 0 – i.e.,
equivalently, a real line in which two numbers diﬀering by a multiple of h describe
the same point: (x1, . . . , x4, x5)
h). Thus, it is natural to
deﬁne K-vectors as simply elements of K:

(x1, . . . , x4, x5 + k

On the set of all vectors in R4, there are two natural operations: (commu-

this set is a linear space.

·

In contrast, on the the set K of all K-vectors we only have addition, so the

set of all K-vectors is not a linear space, it is only an Abelian group.

7 K-Covectors

In physics, an important algebraic object is a covector: vectors describe the loca-
tion x of a particle, while the corresponding covector p describes the energy and
momentum of the corresponding particle. Because of this physical importance,
it is necessary to generalize the notion of covectors to the new space.

We would like to provide a generalization that preserves the physical meaning
of the connection between vectors and covectors. The physical connection is
probably best described in quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, due to
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle ∆x
¯h, if we know the exact location of
∆p
a particle (i.e., if ∆x = 0), then we have no information about the momentum
(i.e., ∆p =
), and vice versa, if we know the exact momentum (∆p = 0),
then we have no information about the particle’s location. In other words, if we
have a state with a deﬁnite momentum p, and we then shift the coordinates by
a vector t, i.e., replace x by x + t, the known state of the particle should not
change.

·

In quantum mechanics, a state of the particle is described by a complex-
valued function ψ(x) called a wave function. The wave function itself is not
2. So, if we multiply
directly observable, what we observe are probabilities

all the values of the wave-function by a complex number ϕ with

ϕ
|
|
a number of the type exp(i
1 and α is a real number), then
all the probabilities remain the same – i.e., from the physical viewpoint, we will
have exactly the same state. Thus, for every real number α, the functions ψ(x)
ψ(x) describe exactly the same state. When we say that the state
and exp(i
x + t, we mean that the original function
ψ(x) does not change after shift x
ψ(x) and the function ψ(x + t) that describe the shifted state describe the same
ψ(x) for some complex number

Since exp(i

π. Thus,

α(t) is a point on a circle rather than a real number.

For x = 0, we get ψ(t) = ϕ(t)

ψ(0), so modulo a multiplicative constant,
shift-invariant states ψ(t) are equal to the corresponding functions ϕ(t). So, to
determine such states, we must describe all the corresponding functions ϕ(t).

When we shift by t = 0, the function remains unchanged, i.e., ϕ(0) = 1

(equivalently, α(0) = 0).

is a mapping from R4 to the unit circle S1 =

1 and sum into sum. In mathematics, such a mapping is called a homomorphism
from an Abelian additive group R4 to S1.

It is also physically reasonable to assume that the wave function is continuous
– hence, that the homomorphism ϕ is continuous. Continuous homomorphisms
from an Abelian group G to a unit circle are called characters; the set of all
such characters is also an Abelian group called dual (and denoted by G∗). So,
it is natural to associate covectors with elements of the dual group.

For R4, this deﬁnition ﬁts well with the more traditional one, because it is
known that for R4, the dual group is also R4: every character has the form
exp(i

Deﬁnition 2. A K-covector is a character of the group K, i.e., a continuous
homomorphism from K to S1. By a sum of two covectors we mean the product
of the corresponding homomorphisms.

The set of all K-covectors is thus a dual group K ∗ to K. It is known that
elements of this dual group have the form exp(i
x), where p = (p1, . . . , p4, p5),
p1, . . . , p4 can be any real numbers, and p5 is an multiple of 1/h. Thus, the group
K ∗ of all K-covectors is isomorphic to R4
Z, where Z is the additive group
of all integers.

8 K-Tensors

To describe individual particles, it is usually suﬃcient to consider vectors (that
describe their location) and covectors (that describe their momentum). How-
ever, to describe ﬁeld theories such as Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism or
Einstein’s General Relativity theory, it is not suﬃcient to consider only vectors
and covectors, we also need to consider tensors.

Speciﬁcally, for G = R4, for every two integers p
0, a tensor
≥
of valence (p, q) can be deﬁned as a multi-linear map Gp
R – where
multi-linear means that if we ﬁx the values of all the variables but one, we get
a linear mapping. Every such multi-linear mapping has the form

Comments. For R4 instead of K, this deﬁnition coincides with the traditional
one.

When K = R4

S1, this deﬁnition is consistent with the previous ones:
K-tensors of valence (0, 1) are K-covectors, and K-tensors of valence (1, 0) are
K-vectors.

This deﬁnition can be reformulated as follows: a K-tensor is a multi-linear
mapping that is consistent with the equivalence sets structure, i.e., for which

9 Explaining the Condition g55 = const and the

Deﬁnition 6. We say that a K-tensor ﬁeld of valence (p, q) is diﬀerentiable if
the corresponding component tensor ﬁeld is continuously diﬀerentiable, and its
gradient ﬁeld also deﬁnes a K-tensor ﬁeld.

7

In other words, to diﬀerentiate a K-tensor ﬁeld, we form the corresponding
tensor ﬁeld, diﬀerentiate it, and then interpret the result as a K-tensor ﬁeld
of valence (p + 1, q). When is this possible? The answer to this question is as
follows:

11 Cylindricity Explained

for angular-valued ones), we have the cylindricity condition ∂t...

the cylindricity conditions is also explained by the geometric model.

12 Linear Coordinate Transformations

In the traditional aﬃne geometry, in addition to shifts, we can also consider
arbitrary linear coordinates transformations. In geometric terms, we can deﬁne
these transformations as continuous automorphisms of the additive group K0 =
R4. We can deﬁne vectors and tensors as continuous homomorphisms T : K p
0 ×
S1; in this case, e.g., standard formulas for transforming covectors
(K ∗
S1) can be uniquely determined by
(i.e., continuous homomorphisms g : K0 →
the requirement that the value g(a) be preserved under such a transformation,
i.e., that g′(a′) = g(a). Similarly, the transformation law for tensors can be
determined by the condition that

Comment. We have already mentioned that functions on K = R4
S1 are
simply functions on R5 which are periodic in x5 with the period h. Also, a K-
covector p can be simply viewed as a covector for which the ﬁfth component p5
is an integer multiple of 1/h. Thus,, e.g., a K-covector ﬁeld on K can be viewed
as a covector ﬁeld p(x) = (p1(x), . . . , p5(x)) on R5 that satisﬁes the following
two properties:

×

(a) this ﬁeld is periodic in x5 with period p;

(b) for each x, the value p5(x) is an integer multiple of 1/h.

It is therefore reasonable to deﬁne a general coordinate transformation of K as
a coordinate transformation of R5 that preserves this property, i.e., under which
a covector ﬁeld that satisﬁes the properties (a) and (b) are transformed into a
covector ﬁeld that also satisﬁes these properties. One can see that this leads to
the same class of general coordinate transformations.

14 Gauge Transformations Explained

of a 4D transformation and an additional gauge transformation x5

15 Case of Curved Space-Time

In modern physics, space-time is a manifold, i.e., a topological space V which is
S1,
locally diﬀeomorphic to R4. Since our basic model is not R4, but K = R4
it is reasonable to deﬁne a K-manifold as a topological space that is locally
diﬀeomorphic to K.

×

From the mathematical viewpoint, K is R5 factorized over the vector e =
(0, . . . , 0, h): i.e., a
b is an integer multiple of e. Thus, a
−
natural way to describe a K-manifold is to describe a standard 5D manifold in
which we have a vector e(x) in every tangent space – i.e., a manifold with an
additional vector ﬁeld.

∼

In this case, every tangent space is isomorphic to K. Thus, a K-tensor ﬁeld
V into a K-tensor

can be deﬁned as a mapping that maps every point x

16 Auxiliary Result: Why There Is No Phys-
ically Useful Gravitational Analog of Hertz
Potential

In electromagnetism, in addition to the electromagnetic ﬁle Fij and the potential
Ai from which this ﬁled can be obtained by diﬀerentiation Fij = ∂Ai/∂xj
−
∂Aj/∂xi, there is also a useful notion of a Hertz potential H ik for which Ai can
be obtained by diﬀerentiation Ai =

∂H ik/∂xk.

Pk

In gravitation, the natural analogy of potentials Ai is the gravity tensor
ﬁled gij. From the purely mathematical viewpoint, it is possible to introduce a
gravitational analog of the Hertz potential: namely, there exists a tensor ﬁeld
Πijk for which

gij =

∂Πijk
∂xk ;

X
k

(2)

see, e.g., [Palchik 1969]. However, in contrast to the electromagnetic case, this
new potential does not seem to have any physical applications. Why?

Our explanation is simple: while (2) is impossible in the 4D case, it is no

longer possible if we consider 5D K-tensor ﬁelds.

Appendix: Proofs

Proof of Proposition 1

×

Let us ﬁrst prove that every K-tensor can be described by the desired formula.
Indeed, let t be a K-tensor. Let us ﬁrst consider the restriction of t to
(R4)q. Since locally, K coincides with R5, this restriction is, locally, a
K p
multi-linear map from (R5)p
(R4)q to S1. Since it is multi-linear, at 0, the
value of this map is 1. In a small vicinity of 1, we can deﬁne a unique angle
ln t. The resulting mapping is – locally – a multi-linear mapping, in the
(1/i)
(R4)q to R. Hence, in this vicinity,
traditional sense of this term, from (R5)p
(R4)q, we get the

Similar formulas hold for the subsets that can be obtained by replacing some

a sum of p(4) = (p1, . . . , p4, 0)

of these two vectors, we have the desired formula; multiplying them, we get a
similar formula for p. By using a similar decomposition w.r.t. other variables,
we get the desired formula for all possible inputs from K p

Let us ﬁrst consider the case p > 1. For di2 = . . . = yip = 0, the diﬀerence
is equal to 0; this diﬀerence continuously depends on di2 , . . . , yip , and it is only
allowed a discrete set of values. Due to continuity, it cannot “jump” to values

Proof of Proposition 2

According to Proposition 1, the only possibly non-zero component of a K-
tensor with 5 as one of the lower indices is the component t5...5
. All the values
∂tj1...jq
i1...ip /∂x5 contain 5 as one of the lower indices, so the only component for
which this value can be diﬀerent from 0 is the one with p = 0 and i1 = . . . =
ip = 5. For this component, ∂t5...5/∂x5 = 2
k. Since the K-tensor
ﬁeld is continuously diﬀerentiable, this value cannot jump to a diﬀerent value of
k, so this derivative is constant. Integrating over x5, we get the desired formula
for the the dependence of this component on x5 – as a linear function of x5.

Proof of Proposition 4

The condition that the tangent transformation is K-linear means that
∂s5/∂x5 =
1 (and due to continuity this does not depend on the point x,
i.e., either it is everywhere equal to 1, or it is everywhere equal to
1), and
∂si/∂x5 = 0 for i < 4. Hence, s5 =
x5 + f (x1, . . . , x4) and si = f i(x1, . . . , x4)
for i < 5.

However, according to our general result about components of K-tensors, all the

value ∂g55/∂x5.

ABSTRACT- When a ﬂat stress-free surface (i.e., the ground in seismological applications) sep-
arating air from a isotropic, homogeneous or horizontally-layered, solid substratum is solicited by
a SH plane body wave incident in the substratum, the response in the substratum is a single
specularly-reﬂected body wave. When the stress-free condition, equivalent to vanishing impedance,
is relaxed by the introduction of a spatially-modulated, non-vanishing impedance, the response
turns out to take the form of a spectrum of plane body waves and surface waves.
It is shown
that, in a great variety of situations, resonances are produced at the frequencies of which one or
several surface wave amplitudes can become large. Furthermore, at resonance, the amplitude of the
motion on the surface is shown to be ampliﬁed with respect to the situation in which the surface
impedance vanishes. A subsidiary, but all-important, eﬀect of this resonant response is that, when
the solicitation is pulse-like, the peak value of the time history of surface motion is larger, and the
duration of the signal is considerably longer, for a spatially-modulated impedance surface than for
a constant, or vanishing, impedance surface.

1 General introduction

An important question in seismology, civil engineering, urban planning, and natural disaster risk
assessment is: to what extent does surface topography of diﬀerent length and height scales (ranging
from those of mountains and hills to city blocks and buildings) modify the seismic response on the
ground?

There exists experimental evidence (Singh and Ordaz, 1993; Davis and West, 1973; Griﬃths and
Bollinger, 1979) that this modiﬁcation is real and can attain considerable proportions as regards
increases in peak ground motion and signal duration. Some theoretical studies (Wirgin, 1989;
Wirgin 1990; Wirgin and Kouoh-Bille, 1993; Groby, 2005) seem to indicate that such eﬀects are
indeed possible, but various numerical studies ( Bouchon, 1973; Bard, 1982; Sanchez-Sesma, 1987,
Geli et al., 1988; Wirgin and Bard, 1996; Gu´eguen, 2000; Clouteau and Aubry, 2001; Gu´eguen et
al., 2002; Semblat et al., 2003; Tsogka and Wirgin, 2003; Boutin and Roussillon, 2004; Kham, 2004;
Groby and Tsogka, 2005) yield conﬂicting results in that some of these point to ampliﬁcation, while
others to very weak eﬀects, or even to de-ampliﬁcation. Contradictory results are also obtained
regarding the duration of the earthquakes.

The present contribution is devoted to establishing, in a hopefully-decisive manner, whether
the aggravation of earthquake eﬀects can or cannot be induced by uneven topography and/or

the presence of buildings on the ground. Furthermore, if such aggravated seismic phenomena are
produced, we want to know whether they are rare or of systematic nature, and what their underlying
causes may be.

We provide herein a theoretical and numerical analysis which supports the conclusion that
such substantial deleterious eﬀects can, and will, indeed occur repeatedly if the irregularity of the
ground is spatially-periodic, as often occurs in portions of modern cities and in various geological
formations.

Space-time and space-frequency formulations

In the following, we shall be concerned with the determination of the vectorial displacement ﬁeld
u on, and underneath, the ground in response to a seismic solicitation. In general, u is a function
of the spatial coordinates, incarnated in the vector x and time t, so that u = u(x, t).

Since we shall employ the concept of surface impedance (Biot, 1968; Wait, 1971; Gu´eguen,
2000), and since the latter is deﬁned, stricto sensu, only in the space-frequency domain, we shall
carry out our analysis therein, and thus search for u(x, ω), with ω the angular frequency. The time
history of response u(x, t) will then be computed via the Fourier transform

wherein u(x, ω) is a generally-complex function, and u(x, t) a real function.

u(x, t) =

u(x, ω) exp(−iωt)dω ,

3 Reﬂection of a SH plane wave from a planar spatially-modulated impedance

boundary

3.1 Features of the problem
The uneven ground is replaced by the ﬂat, horizontal, planar boundary I {x2 = 0 ; ∀x1 ∈ R ; ∀x3 ∈
R} which separates the lower half-inﬁnite region x2 < 0 from the upper half-inﬁnite region x2 > 0.
The medium ﬁlling x2 > 0 is air, assumed for the purpose of the analysis, to be the vacumn. The
uneveness of the ground is accounted for by a suitably-chosen surface impedance function.

The incident plane body seismic wave propagates in x2 < 0 towards I. Attention will be
restricted to the displacement ﬁeld exclusively in x2 ≤ 0 (in fact, this is the purpose of employing
the concept of surface impedance).

We choose the cartesian coordinate system so that the wavevector associated with the incident
shear wave lies in the x1 − x2 plane. This signiﬁes that the displacement associated with this wave
is perpendicular to the x1 − x2 plane and therefore lies in a horizontal plane. Thus, the incident
wave is a shear-horizontal (SH) wave. Moreover, the motion associated with this wave is, due to
the choice of the cartesian reference system, independent of the coordinate x3. This implies that
the resultant total motion induced by this incident wave is independent of x3, i.e., the boundary
value problem is 2D, so that it is suﬃcient to look for the displacement ﬁeld in the x1 − x2 plane.
Actually, due to previous comments, we look for the total displacement ﬁeld (hereafter designated
by u(x, ω) := (0, 0, u(x, ω))) only in the lower half of the x1 − x2 plane, i.e., in Ω. The trace of the
boundary I in the x1 − x2 plane is designated by Γ .

Hereafter, we designate the (real) density and (real) Lam´e parameters in Ω by ρ > 0 and

λ ≥ 0, µ ≥ 0 respectively.

3.2 Governing equations

The mathematical translation of the boundary value problem in the space-frequency domain is:

µ[u,11(x, ω) + u,22(x, ω)] + ρω2u(x, ω) = 0 ; ∀x = (x1, x2) ∈ Ω ,

iωZ(x1, ω)u(x, ω) + µu,2(x, ω) = 0 ; ∀x ∈ Γ ,

ud(x, ω) := u0(x, ω) − ui(x, ω) ∼ outgoing waves ; kxk → ∞ , x ∈ Ω ,
(4)
wherein u(x, ω) is the total displacement ﬁeld, ud(x, ω) the (unknown) diﬀracted ﬁeld and ui(x, ω)
the (known) incident ﬁeld in Ω given by:

ui(x, ω) = Ai(ω) exp[i(ki

1x1 − ki

2x2)] ; ∀x ∈ Ω , ki

1 = k sin θi , ki

2 = k cos θi , k =

(5)

ω
c

θi being the angle of incidence with respect to the x2 axis, and c =
in the substratum.

µ/ρ the shear wave velocity

Eq. (2) is the space-frequency domain equation of motion, (3) the impedance boundary condi-
tion, (4) the radiation condition, and (5) the description of the incident (plane) body wave. The
impedance Z is a generally-complex function of x1 and ω, i.e.,

p

Z(x1, ω) := R(x1, ω) − iX(x1, ω) ,

(6)

wherein R(x1, ω) and X(x1, ω) are real functions. When the impedance vanishes for all x1, the
boundary condition becomes that of a ﬂat, stress-free surface. Otherwise, the impedance boundary
condition is supposed to simulate the presence of a topographically-uneven stress-free surface.

Until further notice, we drop the ω−dependence on all ﬁeld quantities and consider it to be

implicit.

3.3 Field representations incorporating the radiation condition

Separation of variables (in the cartesian coordinate system), and the outgoing wave condition (4)
lead to the ﬁeld representation:

A(k1) exp[i(k1x1 + k2x2)]dk1 ; k2 =

k2 − k2

and δ( ) is the Dirac distribution.

In the case of constant impedance Z(x1) = ζ = const.
which, after introduction into (8), gives rise to the solution

into (9) and (7) leads to

wherein γ = µki
ω , so that once again we see that kRk < 1 provided (as is assumed herein) that
ζ ′ > 0). This shows that it is impossible to amplify the ﬁeld in Ω and on Γ in a passive conﬁguration
with constant surface impedance.

We shall now show that the situation changes radically when the surface impedance is non-

constant, i.e., depends on x1.

Scattering of a SH plane wave from a periodically-modulated impedance
ground plane

4.1 Preliminaries

As previously, the incident plane wave propagates in Ω toward the ground plane which is assumed
to be ﬂat and to be the locus of a periodically-varying (in the x1 direction) surface impedance, i.e.,
Z(x1 + d) = Z(x1) ; ∀x1 ∈ R ,

(13)

wherein d is the period of the modulation.

4.2 Field representation

Due to the periodicity of Z, we have

Z(x1) =

The impedance boundary condition, the periodicity of Z(x1), and the plane wave nature of the
solicitation entail the Floquet relation

u(x1 + d, x2) = u(x1, x2)eiki

1d ; ∀x1 ∈ R ,

so that the diﬀracted ﬁeld admits the representation

ud(x1, x2) =

(17)

Eq. (16) shows that the diﬀracted ﬁeld is expressed as a sum of plane waves. The plane waves
for which k2n is real are propagative (or homogeneous) and those for which k2n is imaginary are
evanescent or (inhomogeneous). As shown further on, the number of evanescent waves is zero
and the number of propagative waves is one when the surface impedance is constant, so that we
can expect anomalous eﬀects (ampliﬁcation and increased duration of ground motion) to be tied
up with the existence of evanescent waves in the diﬀracted waveﬁeld and to be possible only for
spatially-modulated surface impedances.

It is easy to verify that the previously-obtained solution is recovered for constant (spatially-
speaking) impedance. This means, in particular, that no evanescent waves are present in the
waveﬁeld for constant surface impedance.

4.5 On the possibility of ampliﬁed ﬁelds in the general case of a non-constant, peri-

odic, passive surface impedance

The natural frequencies of the modes of the conﬁguration are obtained by turning oﬀ the solicitation
in the matrix equation (Wirgin, 1996), i.e., g = 0, wherein 0 is the null vector. The solution of
Ef = 0 is trivial (i.e., f = 0) unless det(E) = 0, so that a natural frequency is a value ω = ˜ω for
which (the so-called general dispersion relation) det(E) = 0 at a given si = sin θi = ˜si. When the
conﬁguration is such that the couple (ω, si) of the incident wave (note that ω of the incident wave
is necessarily real) is equal to (˜ω, ˜si), the system is said to be in a state of resonance.
In the case of constant surface impedance, the exact dispersion relation is ζ + µk20

ω = 0, and we
showed previously that this does not correspond to ampliﬁed ground motion for passive impedance,
which is another way of saying that no resonances can exist for a constant, passive impedance
surface.

However, inspection of (20) shows that it is possible for Bn to become large when (the approx-

imate dispersion relation)

Z0 +

µk2n
ω
is satisﬁed, and, owing to the fact that this cannot occur for n = 0 for the previously-mentioned
reason, it can only occur, if at all, for n 6= 0. This shows that if one is to have resonant behavior,
then, at the very least, he must include scattered plane waves of order |n| larger than 0 in the
plane wave representation of the scattered ﬁeld , i.e., he must take into account not only the
specularly-reﬂected (n = 0) wave, but also non-specularly reﬂected waves in this representation.

= 0 ,

(22)

The general form of the surface impedance was Z(x1, ω) = R(x1, ω) − iX(x1, ω). Consider the
case of vanishing dissipation, i.e., R(x1) = 0 (we already took ℑµ = 0, and ℑk = 0 at the outset).
Then the approximate dispersion relation (for ω ≥ 0) is

−iX0(ω) +

µk2n(ω, si)
ω

= 0 .

Now, since ω ≥ 0, ℜµ > 0, ℜk2n > 0, and ℑk2n > 0, the second term in (23) is either positive
real (for real k2n) or positive imaginary (for imaginary k2n), so that the sum of the two terms can
vanish only if

X0 > 0

and ℜk2n = 0 .

The second of these requirements means that resonances occur only for the evanescent waves in the
plane wave representation of the scattered ﬁeld. In other words: we can expect the amplitude of
the n-th order evanescent wave to become inﬁnite (when R = 0) or large (for R > 0) at resonance,
which is another way of saying that a surface wave (evanescent waves are of this sort) is strongly
excited at resonance.

We can anticipate the numerical results: the frequency domain response in Ω and on the ground
will be ampliﬁed at the resonance frequencies, and, in the time domain, the signal will be all the
more ampliﬁed, and its duration will be all the longer, the larger is the quality factor of the
resonance.

The computations of response were made using the zeroth-order approximation in (21) of the
scattering coeﬃcients Bm. The ﬁeld was computed by taking into account: i) no scattered wave (the
result for a stress-free ﬂat ground), ii) only the n = 0 propagative scattered wave, and iii) all (i.e.,
the n = 0, n = −1 and n = 1) the scattered waves (note that higher-order waves do not contribute
to the scattered ﬁeld for the sinusoidally-modulated surface impedance function employed herein).
The results of the computations are given in ﬁgs. 1-3. Case i) is designated therein by kui + urk
and ui + ur, case ii) by k2 + b(0)k and u0, and case iii) by k2 + b(0) + b(−1) + b(1)k and u.

Fig. 1 corresponds to a case in which both the n = −1 and n = 1 waves enter into resonance,
1(ω) and B+1(ω). It seems that the spectrum
as manifested by the sharp peaks in the spectra B
function B0(ω) betrays the existence of a resonance for the n = 0 wave also, but this is not so; in
fact, we are rather in the presence of a pseudo- resonance which is produced at a complex value of
ω. Such pseudo resonances (also termed leaky wave resonances) are produced in any propagative
wave (for r = 0) and the imaginary part of ω reﬂects both material dissipation (embodied in r)
and radiation damping (which exists even for r > 0). One notes that the time history obtained
by neglecting the contribution of the n = −1 and n = 1 waves is similar to that of the ﬂat stress-
free surface, in terms of duration, but diﬀerent (i.e., de-ampliﬁed) from the ﬂat stress-free surface
response in terms of peak amplitude. This is similar to various results of Clouteau and Boutin and
Roussillon, but clearly does not reﬂect the real situation (corresponding to the taking into account
of all scattered waves) in which we observe a very long signal that is even ampliﬁed (in terms of
peak value) with respect to the signal on a ﬂat stress-free ground. The beating phenomenon in this
long-duration signal is due to the presence of two high-quality factor resonances in the scattered
ﬁeld spectrum.

In Fig. 2 we have reduced the parameter s so as to obtain a situation in which none of the
waves enter into resonance. All the signals are approximately of the same form and duration and
are either de-ampliﬁed or of the same peak amplitude. In this case, the various results of Clouteau
and Boutin and Roussillon would be in agreement with the real situation if they had chosen a
conﬁguration similar to ours.

Fig. 3 diﬀers from the previous case by a signiﬁcant increase in the incident angle of the body
wave solicitation. Now a sharp resonance is produced in the n = 1 wave only and the cumulative
translation of this is a near monochromatic, ampliﬁed, long duration response in the time domain.

6 Conclusions

Many other choices of the parameters were found to lead to the types of resonant frequency domain
response described above, which leads us to believe that ampliﬁed, increased-duration time domain
seismic response is a quite common occurrence in a great variety of natural and man-made geological
sites.

The cause of this abnormal response was shown to be the resonant excitation of modes of the

conﬁguration as manifested by poles in the amplitudes of the scattered waves.

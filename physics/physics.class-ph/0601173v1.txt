Abstract. The derivation of the eﬃciency of Carnot cycle is usually done by
calculating the heats involved in two isothermal processes and making use of the
associated adiabatic relation for a given working substance’s equation of state, usually
the ideal gas. We present a derivation of Carnot eﬃciency using the same procedure
with Redlich-Kwong gas as working substance to answer the calculation diﬃculties
raised by Agrawal and Menon [1]. We also show that using the same procedure, the
Carnot eﬃciency may be derived regardless of the functional form of the gas equation
of state.

In any course of undergraduate thermodynamics, thermodynamical cycle and its
eﬃciency hardly miss their parts. The discussion of thermodynamical cycle is always
followed by, or is parallel to, the discussion of the second law of thermodynamics. For
a reversible cycle, it is well-known that the eﬃciency η of such cycle is

where TH and TC are the absolute temperatures of hot and cold heat reservoirs. For an
irreversible cycle, since total change of entropy increases, the eﬃciency of such cycle is
less than (I.1).

1. Introduction.

(I.1)

,

There are many theoretical cycles that satisfy the eﬃciency (I.1) [2], but the so-
called Carnot cycle is of interest because of its simple manner in describing a reversible
cycle, i.e. it consists of an isothermal expansion at ﬁxed high temperature, followed by
an adiabatic expansion from high to low temperatures, and followed by an isothermal
compression at ﬁxed low temperature, and ﬁnally the cycle is completed by an adiabatic
In most textbooks of either elementary
compression from low to high temperatures.
physics or thermodynamics, the Carnot eﬃciency (I.1) is derived with ideal gas as
its substance because of its mathematical simplicity using the following customary
procedure : calculating the heats involved in isothermal expansion and compression in
p − V , V − T or p − T diagrams, then relating them with the associated adiabatic

relation. However, the second law of thermodynamics suggests that the eﬃciency (I.1)
should be independent of working substance [3], so it is natural to question whether the
Carnot eﬃciency can be obtained from other gas equations of state using the procedure
above. Some attempt has been made to do the task above, among them is the work of
Agrawal and Menon [1] who used van der Waals equation of state to derive the Carnot
eﬃciency through the procedure above, and it turned out that their result agreed with
(I.1). Nevertheless, they pointed out that there were some calculation diﬃculties arose
when the derivation was proceeded for Redlich-Kwong equation of state using the same
procedure, together with some clues of how to overcome the problem.

In this paper we shall derive the Carnot eﬃciency (I.1) with Redlich-Kwong gas as
working substance to answer the calculation diﬃculties raised by Agrawal and Menon,
and we also show that using the customary procedure, we may obtain the eﬃciency
(I.1) regardless of functional form of the equation of state. We start with brief review of
the generalized thermodynamics properties, i.e. properties satisﬁed by any equation of
state, in Section 2. Using the relations discussed in Section 2, we shall derive the Carnot
eﬃciency from Redlich-Kwong equation of state in Sections 3. In Section 4, we present
the derivation of Carnot eﬃciency without any knowledge of the substance’s equation
of state using the customary procedure. The discussion will be conclude in Section 5.

2. Generalized Thermodynamic Properties

In this section we shall brieﬂy review some thermodynamic properties satisﬁed by any
equation of state.

2.1. Maxwell Relations

An equation of state in thermodynamics may be written as

where p, V and T are pressure, volume and absolute temperature of substance,
respectively. Eq. (II.2) yields the following relations :

However, the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics and the deﬁnition of entropy suggests that
there is another degree of freedom that should be taken into account, i.e. the entropy
S, for

dU = T dS − pdV −→ U = U(S, V ),

where U is the internal energy of the substance. From Eq. (II.6), it is clear that

according to the exactness condition of internal energy U.
Using Legendre transformations [4], we may deﬁne

H(p, S) = U(S, V ) + pV,

F (V, T ) = U(S, V ) − T S,

G(P, T ) = H(p, S) − T S,

dH = T dS + V dp,

dF = − pdV − SdT,

dG = V dp − SdT,

which lead us to

where H(p, S), F (V, T ) and G(p, T ) are enthalpy, Helmholtz and Gibbs functions,
respectively. Diﬀerentiating Eqs. (II.9), (II.10) and (II.11) give

due to the exactness of H(p, S), F (V, T ) and G(p, T ). The set of Eqs. (II.8), (II.15),
(II.16) and (II.17) is called the Maxwell relations [2, 3].

2.2. General Properties of Entropy and Internal Energy

Now let us express the entropy U and internal energy S in terms of measurable
quantities. Let U = U(V, T ), then

dU =

Suppose S = S(T, V ), then

Since the change of U depends only on the initial and ﬁnal states of a thermodynamical
system, then the function U = U(V, T ) maybe obtained from Eq. (II.23) if the following
exactness condition is fulﬁlled :

∂Cv

= T

It is easy to see that Eq. (II.24) must also be satisﬁed to ensure the exactness of
Eq. (II.20). Eq. (II.24) also tells us the volume dependence of Cv.

2.3. General Relations of Isothermal and Adiabatic Processes

In an isothermal process, the change of internal energy is given by

using Eq. (II.23). Using the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics dU = dQ − p dV , the heat
involved in this process is

3. Carnot Eﬃciency of Redlich-Kwong Equation of State

whose equation of state is given by

p =

where n is the number of moles of the gas, R ≈ 8.31 J mol−1K −1 is the gas constant,
a and b are constants evaluated from critical state of the gas [2]. The Carnot cycle
is given in the following order : an isothermal expansion at ﬁxed temperature TH from
states 1 to 2, an adiabatic expansion from states 2 to 3, an isothermal compression at
ﬁxed temperature TC from states 3 to 4, and ﬁnally, an adiabatic compression from state
4 back to state 1, where TC < TH .

From Eq. (II.24), the volume dependence of the heat capacity of constant volume

Cv for Redlich-Kwong gas is

It is clear that Eq. (III.33) is not an exact ﬁrst order non-linear diﬀerential equation,
which means that we have to ﬁnd a suitable integrating factor in order to transform
Eq. (III.33) to an exact diﬀerential equation. The correspondence integrating factor
µ(V, T ) for Eq. (III.33) is surprisingly simple :

µ(V, T ) −→ µ(T ) =

4. Derivation of Carnot Eﬃciency of Arbitrary Gas Equation of State

The success of obtaining Carnot eﬃciency with van der Waals in Ref. [1] and Redlich-
Kwong gases in the previous section has tempted us to question whether we may obtain
Eq. (I.1) from any working substance using the same procedure mentioned in Section 3.
Using the same order of Carnot cycle as given in Section 3 and with help of Eq. (II.26),
the involved heat in isothermal expansion from states 1 to 2, as well as isothermal
compression from states 3 to 4 are

Q1→2 = TH

dV ≡ TH [F (V2, TH) − F (V1, TH )] ,

(IV.48)

Q3→4 = TC

dV ≡ TC [F (V4, TC) − F (V3, TC)] ,

(IV.49)

respectively, where F (V, T ) =

dV .

(cid:17)

R (cid:16)

In the adiabatic process, with the help of Eq. (II.24) it is easy to see that Eq. (II.27)
is not an exact ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation. However, by multiplying Eq. (II.27) with
a suitable integrating factor, which turns out to be µ(V, T ) = 1
T like the one used in
Section 3, we obtain a new ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation whose exactness condition is
just Eq. (II.24). The general solution of this new equation is

dV + g(T ) = constant −→ F (V, T ) + g(T ) = constant, (IV.50)

dT is an arbitrary function of temperature. Using Eq. (IV.50),
where g(T ) =
the relation between states 2 and 3 in the adiabatic expansion, as well as the relation
between states 4 and 1 in the adiabatic compression are

R

g(TH) − g(TC) = F (V3, TC) − F (V2, TH),
g(TH) − g(TC) = F (V4, TC) − F (V1, TH),

respectively. Equating Eqs. (IV.51) and (IV.52), we get

F (V3, TC) − F (V4, TC) = F (V2, TH ) − F (V1, TH).

5. Summary and Conclusion

In this paper, we have derived the Carnot eﬃciency from Redlich-Kwong as well as
arbitrary gas equations of state using the procedure given in Section 1. Both results are
in agreement with Eq. (I.1).

From the derivation using Redlich-Kwong equation of state, we show that the
derivation procedure succeeds even the speciﬁc heat at constant volume Cv is the
function of volume and temperature - the diﬃculty encountered by Agrawal and
6= 0.
Menon [1] while deriving Carnot eﬃciency using equation of state with
As shown by Eq. (III.30), we may write the analytical form of Cv(V, T ) with unknown
function of temperature in it as long as we know the volume dependence of Cv through
. Through Eq. (III.46), it is clear that the equation of adiabatic relations between

∂Cv

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

states 1, 2, 3 and 4 does not depend on that unknown function of temperature.
(cid:16)

(cid:17)
On the contrary of Agrawal-Menon’s discussion in Ref. [1] that it is diﬃcult to apply
the procedure stated in Section 1 for a ﬁnite Carnot cycle when the working substance
is arbitrary, our results in Section 4 shows that it is technically possible to derive the
Carnot eﬃciency (I.1) from the general thermodynamic properties discussed in Section 2.
However, since the thermodynamic properties are derived from the Maxwell’s relations
where the concept of entropy is used, the results in Section 4 are hence not surprising.
It is easy to verify that the derivation of Carnot eﬃciency from p − V , V − T or p − T
diagrams is equivalent to the same derivation using T − S diagram, which is much easier
to do. Since we can derive the eﬃciency (I.1) from T −S diagram without any knowledge
of working substance, we can also do the same from p − V , V − T or p − T diagrams.
The results in Section 4 may answer student’s questions concerning how the derivation
of Carnot eﬃciency from any given working substance will end up to Eq. (I.1) using the
procedure stated in Section 1.

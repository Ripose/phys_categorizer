We extend an axiomatic approach to classical electrodynamics, which we devel-

oped recently, to the case of non-vanishing magnetic charge. Then two axioms,

namely those of the existence of the Lorentz force (Axiom 2) and of magnetic ﬂux

conservation (Axiom 3) have to be generalized. Electric/magnetic reciprocity con-

stitutes a guiding principle for this undertaking. The extension of the axioms can

be implemented at a premetric stage, i.e., when metric and connection of spacetime

don’t play a role. Complex Riemann-Silberstein ﬁelds of the form (E

I. MAGNETIC CHARGE AND ELECTRIC/MAGNETIC RECIPROCITY

An axiomatic approach to classical

electrodynamics without magnetic charges

(monopoles) has been developed in [7].

In this approach, the initial structure of space-

time is that of a 4-dimensional diﬀerentiable manifold foliated by means of a monotonically

increasing ‘topological time’ parameter σ (see also [5]). Maxwell’s equations are expressed

in terms of the twisted excitation 2-form H, the twisted electric current 3-form J, and the

untwisted ﬁeld strength 2-form F :

dH = J ,

dF = 0 .

(1)

The diﬀerent ﬁelds decompose into time and space pieces according to

where, in 3 dimensions,

and E are 1-forms,

form. Eq.(2) provides the physical interpretation of the 4-dimensional diﬀeomorphism and

frame invariant Maxwell equations (1) in terms of measurable quantities, namely the electric

and the magnetic excitations

,

, the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths E, B, and the

D

H

electric charge density ρ and its current density j, respectively. Up to here, we are still

on a premetric level: Neither a metric of spacetime nor a connection are assumed to exist.

Additional spacetime structures, including the light cone and other elements of a Lorentzian

metric, emerge only after a further condition is imposed via a spacetime relation deﬁning

the electromagnetic properties of spacetime (of the ‘vacuum’) [19].

In Maxwell’s theory as well as in our axiomatics a clear asymmetry is built in between

electric and magnetic charges. Magnetic charges have been a matter of numerous theoretical

discussions, see, e.g., Schwinger [22, 23], and of experimental investigations. No experimen-

tal evidence exists for magnetic charges or monopoles, see He [6], Abbott et al. [1], and

Kalbﬂeisch et al. [13]. Nevertheless, in this note, following a discussion with Kaiser, see [9],

we want to address the question how our axiomatics can be adapted to the introduction of

magnetic charges.

Let us remind ourselves that for the derivation of Maxwell’s equations (1) we need Axiom

1, namely charge conservation dJ = 0, Axiom 2, the existence of the Lorentz force density

fα = (ea

F )
⌋

∧

J

(3)

(here eα is the frame or vierbein ﬁeld), and Axiom 3, magnetic ﬂux conservation dF = 0.

Furthermore, for our theoretical analysis Axiom 4 is required, the (still premetric) localiza-

tion of electromagnetic energy and momentum by means of the twisted kinematic energy-

momentum current 3-form

kΣα :=

As shown in [7], this current,

in contrast to Maxwell’s equations themselves,

is elec-

tric/magnetic reciprocal, i.e., it is invariant under the substitutions

with a constant twisted 0-form ζ of the dimension of an admittance. In (5), (6), a mag-

netic quantity is replaced by an electric one and an electric quantity by a magnetic one.

Accordingly, we can speak of an electric/magnetic reciprocity of the energy-momentum cur-
rent kΣα. Observe the non-trivial minus sign on the left-hand-side of (6) which is necessary
because of the structure of kΣα.

In a straightforward way, we can try to introduce an untwisted magnetic current 3-form

K that is conserved according to dK = 0, in analogy to Axiom 1, and that again could

be veriﬁed by pure counting arguments. If this new Axiom 3′ is suitably formulated, we

would ﬁnd, by de Rham’s theorem, the magnetic current K, analogously to the electric

current J, as exact 3-form: dF = K. If we uphold Axioms 1, 2, and 4, then we expect

an inconsistency since, according to Axiom 2, the electromagnetic ﬁeld would only act on

electric not, however, on magnetic charges.

Before we continue this line of arguments, let us take a look at the ‘new’ Maxwell equa-

If we now introduce, in addition to (5), (6), a new substitution for the electric and magnetic

tions:

then not only the energy-momentum current (4) is electric/magnetic reciprocal but also the

Maxwell equations (7) themselves.

Let us come back to the last but one paragraph. In order to remove the inconsistency

mentioned, we have, in addition to Axiom 3, also to change at least one other axiom.

As argued, Axiom 2 would now appear to be shaky. This axiom of standard (monopole-

free) electrodynamics deﬁnes the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength F by means of the Lorentz

force density acting on a moving electric charge density. The assumption of the existence of

magnetic charge requires to modify the Lorentz force axiom correspondingly by also including

a piece for the force acting on the magnetic charge. However, magnetic monopoles were

never observed, and thus we cannot appeal to experiment in formulating the modiﬁcation

of Axiom 2. As a matter of fact, there exists a huge ambiguity in choosing the form of the

new “Lorentz” force density, and we can only rely on purely theoretical arguments. Among

other possibilities, the use of electric/magnetic reciprocity as a guiding principle provides a

self-consistent and mathematically nice framework.

If we supplement the right-hand-side of (3) such that it becomes electric/magnetic recip-

rocal, we ﬁnd

fα = (eα

(9)

The second term describes the force acting on a magnetic charge. Then, following along

the same line of thought as in our standard premetric axiomatics [7], we naturally arrive at

the unchanged Axiom 4 for the electromagnetic energy-momentum current, as we speciﬁed

it in (4). Accordingly, by assuming the existence of hypothetical magnetic charges, one can

develop a straightforward generalization of the axiomatic premetric approach by stressing

speciﬁcally the notion of electric/magnetic reciprocity. The latter can be considered as a

premetric counterpart of electric-magnetic duality.

In order to verify (9), we substitute (7) in (9):

This is eq.(B.5.1) of ref.[7] on page 163 in the case of a = 1. After some simple algebra,

This conclusion coincides with an earlier result of Kaiser [9].

We are now coming to the central point: Note that all the expressions in Axiom 2′, see

(9), and in Axiom 4, see (4), are invariant under the electric/magnetic reciprocity mapping
⊛ deﬁned by

⊛ H = ζF , ⊛F =

⊛J = ζK , ⊛K =

ζ

ζ

−

−

J .

Since F has the the dimension of an action and H that of a charge, ζ has the dimen-
sion of an admittance or reciprocal impedance. Furthermore, to keep ⊛H twisted and ⊛F

twist-free, ζ must transform as a pseudoscalar, changing sign under orientation-reversing

diﬀeomorphisms. Of course, by reciprocity, Axiom 1 is mapped to Axiom 3, and vice versa.

Accordingly, as we saw already, the ‘new’ Maxwell equations are also electric/magnetic re-

ciprocal. In the absence of a metric, reciprocity is a precursor of electric-magnetic duality,

as we will see below. Its manifestation can be seen in the subtle structure of the extended

Lorentz force density (9), which states that the ﬁeld F , generated by the magnetic current

K, exerts a force on the electric current J which generates H, and H in turn exerts a force

on K.

It is interesting to look into the physical meaning of the modiﬁed Axiom 2 and Axiom 3,

namely (9) and (7)2. In simple terms, they tell us that the both electromagnetic ﬁelds, H as

well as F , are simultaneously of the type of excitations (i.e., quantities) and of ﬁeld strengths

(i.e., intensities). Thus, if magnetic charges exist, the electric/magnetic reciprocity washes

out the diﬀerence between these notions and we naturally come to the conclusion that these

ﬁelds might be combined into a single electric/magnetically symmetric object.

II. COMPLEX STRUCTURES

We know that the expressions in (7), (9), and (4) are invariant under the electric/magnetic

reciprocity mapping (15). This suggests that we introduce the complex electromagnetic ﬁeld

and its conjugate complex [7]:

Then the reciprocity mapping yields

U := H + iζF ,

U = H

iζF .

−

⊛U =

iU ,

⊛U = +iU ,

−

that is, U and U are eigenvectors of the reciprocity mapping and acquire a nontrivial meaning

thereby. In physical terms this means that U is, up to a factor, electric/magnetic reciprocal.
Furthermore by implication, ⊛ ⊛ U =

U . Therefore the reciprocity

U and ⊛ ⊛ U =

−

−

mapping induces locally an almost complex structure on the underlying spacetime manifold.

If we introduce the complex electric/magnetic current

J := J + iζK ,

dU = J.

⊛J =

iJ .

−

then we can display the complex Maxwell equation as

If and only if we have a nontrivial magnetic current K

= 0, the electric/magnetic reciprocity

extends to the Maxwell equation, since

However, conventionally, with vanishing magnetic current K = 0, reciprocity is conﬁned to

the energy-momentum 3-form of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (see (4)), where we observed it in

the ﬁrst place:

(22)

Our earlier results are already incorporated in this generally covariant and premetric

framework developed so far in this section. To make them explicitly visible, we can use a

foliation and the “topological” time σ. Quite generally, a 2-form decomposes according to

U =

U⊥ ∧
−

dσ + U ,

(23)

6
see [7]. Here U⊥, a 1-form in 3 dimensions, is the timelike (or longitudinal) piece of U and

U , a 2-form, the spacelike (or transversal) piece of U. By means of (2) and (23), we ﬁnd

U⊥ =

iζE ,

U =

+ iζB .

H −

D

Thus, the timelike component of U, that is, U⊥, is, apart from the factor

i, the Riemann-

−

Silberstein ﬁeld ζE + i

and the spacelike component U is

+ iζB. Accordingly, we can

H

D

decompose the Maxwell equation (20) by the method quoted. We ﬁnd,

˙U

−

dU⊥ = J⊥ ,

d U = J .

Here the dot is deﬁned by ˙() := £n, where n denotes the normal vector of the spacetime

folio with respect to which the Lie derivative is taken. In this way, we have separated the

evolution equation (25)1 from the constraint equation (25)2; and the extensive quantity the

time evolution of which we are studying is the Riemann-Silberstein ﬁeld

+ iζB.

rediscovered many times and applied to a wide variety of electromagnetic phenomena. Some

examples which we are familiar with include the work of Robinson on null ﬁelds [21], Traut-

man on analytic solutions of Lorentz-invariant equations [25, 26], Newman’s interpretation of

the analytically continued Coulomb ﬁeld as the electromagnetic part of the Kerr-Newman so-

lution [10, 17, 18], Mashhoon’s treatment of wave propagation in a gravitational background

[14, 15, 16], Kaiser’s construction of electromagnetic wavelets [11], and Bialynicki-Birula’s

work on the photon wave function [2] and electromagnetic vortices [3, 4, 12].

Let us stress that all the equations (1) to (28) are generally covariant under coordinate

and frame transformations. There is no metric involved and no Poincar´e group, but rather

the diﬀeomorphism group and the local linear group alone. In other words, this is really a

premetric approach to Maxwell’s theory.

Let us now turn to Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics (“linear vacuum electrodynamics”)

by postulating Axiom 5, that is, the spacetime relation

H = ζ ⋆F .

The spacetime metric comes in with the Hodge star operator ⋆. In SI, the vacuum admittance

is ζ =

ε0/µ0 and the speed of light c = 1/√ε0µ0. Furthermore σ = t, with the metric

p

time t. Then we ﬁnd

U = ζ (⋆F + iF ) ,

U = ζ (⋆F

iF ) ,

−

which thus reduce to the Hodge eigenvectors

⋆U = iU ,

⋆U =

iU ,

−

compare (18). Clearly, ⋆⋆U =

U and ⋆⋆U =

U . In this way, the Hodge star operator

−

inherits the almost complex structure from our electric/magnetic reciprocity mapping. Reci-

procity is primary, Hodge duality secondary. If ⋆ is the 3-dimensional Hodge star, then we

can decompose (29) as

III. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this paper, we formulated an extension of the axiomatic premetric approach to the

case of the magnetic charges. The electric/magnetic reciprocity plays a central role in such

an extension. It is instructive to check the absolute dimensions of the physical quantities

involved. Let us recall [7] that the absolute dimension of the electric current is that of

electric charge, [J] = q. As a result of Axiom 1 and Axiom 2, the absolute dimensions of the

electromagnetic ﬁeld 2-forms are [H] = q and [F ] = h/q, i.e., electric charge and action per

charge, respectively. Now, looking at the modiﬁed Lorentz force density (9), we conclude

that the absolute dimension of the magnetic current 3-form is that of an action per charge:

[K] = h/q. Thus the dimension of the magnetic charge turns out to be ﬁxed, and as a result

classical electrodynamics may only have 4 or less independent dimensional units (contrary

to Sommerfeld [24], e.g., who operated with 5 units). From the dimensional point of view,

the reciprocity operator thus maps electric charge into action per charge, and vice versa.

This fact obviously underlies the well known charge quantization which naturally arises in

the electrodynamics with magnetic monopoles.

The complex electromagnetic ﬁeld U represents a 4-dimensional version of the Riemann-

Silberstein ﬁelds. It provides a compact formulation of the electrodynamic ﬁeld equations

with and without magnetic charges and demonstrates the primary character of the metric-

free reciprocity operator as compared to the metric-dependent Hodge duality operator.

From the mathematical point of view, the modiﬁed axiomatics proposed here is consistent

and it naturally generalizes the approach developed earlier in [7]. However, we should hon-

estly mention that some potentially serious physical problems may arise in this framework.

In the standard formulation, electromagnetism manifests itself by two fundamentally diﬀer-

10

ent physical quantities: excitation and ﬁeld strength. In simple terms, they represent within

electrodynamics the answers to the questions “How many?” and “How strong?”, respec-

tively. When we allow for magnetic charge, this important and clear physical distinction of

quantities and intensities is lost, which may lead to a possible confusion of the interpretation

of the electromagnetic ﬁelds H and F . When combined with the lack of any experimental

evidence of monopoles [1, 6, 13], such a theoretical problem obviously makes us skeptical

with respect to the existence of magnetic charges in nature.

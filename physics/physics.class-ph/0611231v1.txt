Abstract

We study classical energy-momentum (E-m) diagrams for rotational motion of dipolar asymmet-

ric top molecules in strong external ﬁelds. Static electric ﬁelds, nonresonant linearly polarized laser

ﬁelds, and collinear combinations of the two are investigated. We treat speciﬁcally the molecules

iodobenzene (a nearly prolate asymmetric top), pyridazine (nearly oblate asymmetric top), and

iodopentaﬂuorobenzene (intermediate case). The location of relative equilibria in the E-m plane

and associated bifurcations are determined by straightforward calculation, with analytical results

given where possible. In cases where analytical solutions cannot be obtained, we resort to numer-

ical solutions, while keeping a geometrical picture of the nature of the solutions to the fore. The

classiﬁcation we obtain of the topology of classically allowed rotor conﬁguration space regions in

the E-m diagram is of potential use in characterization of energy eigenstates of the corresponding

quantum mechanical problem.

INTRODUCTION

The study of rigid body motion is one of the most important topics in classical and

quantum mechanics [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Of particular importance are the integrable

cases of the rigid body problem [9, 10], which include the free asymmetric top (Euler top)

[1, 4, 6], the symmetric top in a uniform external gravitational ﬁeld (Lagrange top) [6, 11],

and the Kovalevskaya top [6, 12]. The theory of rigid body motion also provides the basis for

analysis and interpretation of the rotational dynamics and spectra of semi-rigid molecules

[2, 5, 13, 14, 15, 16].

In molecular terms the Euler top is simply a free asymmetric top

molecule [5, 14, 15], the Lagrange top models a symmetric top molecule with a dipole

moment in an electric ﬁeld [15, 17], while there does not appear to be an obvious molecular

analogue for the Kovalevskaya top. Breaking the symmetry of the moment of inertia tensor

in the Lagrange top results in the non-integrable problem of an asymmetric top in a static

ﬁeld. Molecular examples of these two cases are iodobenzene (near prolate) [18, 19] and

pyridazine (near oblate) [20] in a static electric ﬁeld. The rotational constants of the molecule

iodopentaﬂuorobenzene make it a more generic example of an asymmetric rotor [21].

The general problem of classical-quantum correspondence [22, 23] is of great interest for

both integrable and nonintegrable rotor systems. Various aspects of the classical-quantum

correspondence have been studied for diatomic molecules in tilted ﬁelds, i.e., noncollinear

static electric and nonresonant linearly polarized laser ﬁelds [24]. The integrable collinear

case exhibits the phenomenon of monodromy [11] both classically and quantum mechanically

[25]. For the nonintegrable case of tilted ﬁelds the rotor motion tends to be integrable in

both low-energy (pendular) and high-energy (free-rotor) limits, and chaotic at intermediate

energies, with the degree of chaos controllable by variation of the angle between the ﬁelds

[24]. For collinear ﬁelds the system is integrable, with both the energy E and the projection

of the angular momentum into the space ﬁxed z-axis, m, as constants of motion. The eﬀective

potential Veﬀ(θ; m) for a given value of m exhibits extrema in the θ (polar) coordinate, which

deﬁne the relative equilibria [4, 6, 26]. Plotting the location of these extrema in the E-m

plane gives the energy-momentum diagram for the system [27]. The E-m diagram provides

a useful global classiﬁcation of the rotor dynamics, as distinct regions of the E-m plane are

associated with diﬀerent allowed types of motion of the diatomic. For symmetric tops in

electric ﬁelds similar diagrams can be constructed [17], and analysis of classical symmetric

2

top E-m and E-k diagrams helps understand the organization of the quantum level spectrum

[17].

The problem of a dipolar asymmetric top in a static external ﬁeld is nonintegrable [27, 28],

as is the problem of a polarizable asymmetric top in a nonresonant laser ﬁeld [27]. For

asymmetric tops in either static or laser ﬁelds or collinear superpositions of the two, the

angular momentum projection m is a constant of motion. Although the complicated form of

the kinetic energy does not allow us to separate an eﬀective potential as straightforwardly as

in the diatomic or the symmetric top case, it is still possible to deﬁne an eﬀective or amended

potential [6, 10, 26] for the class of motions in which the asymmetric top molecule rotates

with constant Euler angles θ and ψ (the third Euler angle φ is an ignorable coordinate).

The energies of the extrema of this potential for given values of m again deﬁne an energy-

momentum diagram [4, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32], which can be used to classify the motions of the

asymmetric top.

The asymmetric top in an external static electric ﬁeld is an example of a dynamical

system with symmetry [6, 26, 33, 34]. The potential energy and Hamiltonian in this case are

invariant with respect to rotations about the space-ﬁxed ﬁeld direction. There is therefore an

associated constant of the motion m, the projection of the angular momentum vector j onto

the external ﬁeld axis, in addition to the energy E. The mapping of the system phase space

onto the E-m plane is called the energy-momentum map [6, 26, 33, 34]. Critical points of this

mapping deﬁne the bifurcations sets in the E-m plane, which form the boundaries of regions

of qualitatively diﬀerent types of classical motion [10, 26]. Following the fundamental work

of Smale [26], applications of these concepts were made to integrable rotor problems [29],

asymmetric rotors in an external gravitational ﬁeld [30], and symmetric [35] and asymmetric

[31] rotors in more complicated potentials. Relative equilibria have also been studied for

rotating semi-rigid molecules in the absence of external ﬁelds [36, 37] and for transition

states in rotationally inelastic collisions [38].

In the present paper we study E-m diagrams of relative equilibria for molecular asymmet-

ric tops for several molecule-ﬁeld conﬁgurations of physical interest [39, 40]: a static electric

ﬁeld; a nonresonant linearly polarized laser ﬁeld; both ﬁelds in a collinear combination. For

the ﬁeld strengths considered, the free asymmetric top motion is strongly perturbed. The

associated E-m diagrams are obtained for the most part analytically. Our aim here is to

understand the nature of the rotor motions associated with diﬀerent regions and curves in

3

the E-m diagrams for physically relevant values of the ﬁeld parameters. We also study the

topological classiﬁcation of the allowed θ-ψ conﬁguration space of the system in terms of

their (multivalued) genus [6]. An extension of these results, to be discussed in a future paper,

involves comparison of computed quantum mechanical eigenstate probability densities with

the boundaries of classically allowed regions in θ-ψ conﬁguration space. The comparisons

indicate that the classical mechanical methods developed here provide a promising founda-

tion for the diﬃcult task of classifying the quantum levels of the complex system consisting

of an asymmetric rotor in external ﬁelds [41, 42, 43].

We mention that the approach adopted here may be thought of as the analogue for

perturbed rotor systems of the methods applied by Kellman and coworkers [44, 45] to vibra-

tional problems exhibiting a single conserved vibrational (superpolyad) quantum number

(see also Ref. 46).

There have been many studies of the classical dynamics of a rigid asymmetric top rotating

about a ﬁxed point in a gravitational ﬁeld (this is the classic heavy top problem); see, for

example [1, 6, 29, 30, 32, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51]. Katok [30] and Gashenenko and Richter [51]

obtained E-m diagrams and analyzed bifurcations of relative equilibria in the E-m plane.

These authors also classiﬁed the topology of accessible system conﬁguration space. We

present here a similar analysis for several molecular examples of an asymmetric top molecule

possessing a dipole moment in a static electric ﬁeld. In the spirit of Katok’s analysis [30],

we use straightforward analytical and geometric methods to build the E-m diagram for the

molecules of interest.

Katok’s treatment was generalized by Tatarinov [31] (see also [6]) to include more compli-

cated gravitational perturbations of the rotational dynamics of an asymmetric top. Although

given for a speciﬁc potential, Tatarinov’s analysis can be mapped directly onto the molecu-

lar case of an asymmetric top in collinear ﬁelds [27]. Following Tatarinov, we obtain E-m

diagrams for asymmetric molecules of physical interest, and study bifurcations and other

characteristic features of the problem, including the topology of the θ-ψ conﬁguration space

and its classiﬁcation according to the genera of the (connected) allowed regions [6].

This paper is organized as follows. First in Section 2 we derive the Hamiltonian for

asymmetric tops in the general tilted ﬁelds case, with the aim of introducing our notation

and conventions. In Section 3 we treat the molecules in a static electric ﬁeld, while in Section

4 we study the same molecules in a nonresonant linearly polarized laser ﬁeld. In Section 5

4

we analyse these molecules in collinear ﬁelds. Section 6 concludes.

Finally we mention that, the advantages of alternative approaches notwithstanding [52],

all calculations reported here have been carried out using polar coordinates.

2. HAMILTONIAN FOR THE ASYMMETRIC TOP IN COMBINED FIELDS

2.1. General case: tilted ﬁelds

We use the y-convention [5] to deﬁne the three Euler angles (θ, φ, ψ) describing the

orientation of the body-ﬁxed frame with respect to lab-ﬁxed frame. In the body-ﬁxed frame

the kinetic energy of the free asymmetric top can be written in terms of the components of

the angular momentum j = (j1, j2, j3) and the three components of the (diagonal) moment
of inertia tensor I = diag(I1, I2, I3)

For an asymmetric top, I1 6= I2 6= I3.

In terms of the Euler angles and their conjugate

momenta (pθ, pφ, pψ) the body-ﬁxed components of j are

Immediately we see that φ is an ignorable coordinate and pφ = m, the projection of j into

the space ﬁxed z-axis, is a constant of the motion for the free top.

If the polarizability in the molecule-ﬁxed frame is given by the diagonal tensor α =

diag(α1, α2, α3), the interaction with a nonresonant laser ﬁeld polarized along the space-

ﬁxed z-axis is [39]

L proportional to the intensity of the laser ﬁeld. Omitting the angle-independent term

(which produces a constant shift in energy) we obtain

VL = −∆ω2 sin2 θ sin2 ψ − ∆ω3 cos2 θ,

(2.6)

with ∆ω2 = (α2 − α1) ε2

L/4. Assuming the dipole moment to lie
along the molecule-ﬁxed ¯z-axis, the interaction with a static electric ﬁeld tilted through an

L/4 and ∆ω3 = (α3 − α1) ε2

angle β with respect to the space-ﬁxed z-axis and lying in the space-ﬁxed xy-plane is

VS = −d0εS(cos β cos θ + sin β cos φ sin θ),

(2.7)

where d0 is the magnitude of the electric dipole moment and εS is the strength of the static

ﬁeld.

(2.4), (2.7) and (2.6) as

The Hamiltonian of the asymmetric top in tilted ﬁelds can be written from equations

H = T + VS + VL.

(2.8)

Note that the potential VS + VL is a function of the angle φ, so that m is not conserved. The

asymmetric top in tilted ﬁelds is therefore a physically signiﬁcant rotor problem with three

degrees of freedom. For collinear ﬁelds, β = 0, the φ angle is not present in H and pφ = m

is then a constant of the motion. In the remainder of this paper we consider the collinear

case only.

2.2. Collinear ﬁelds

The Hamiltonian for an asymmetric top molecule in collinear ﬁelds can be rewritten as

H = 1

2(I−1j) · j + V (θ, ψ),

(2.9)

V (θ, ψ) = −ω cos θ − ∆ω2 sin2 θ sin2 ψ − ∆ω3 cos2 θ.

(2.11c)

The projection of j onto the space-ﬁxed unit vector ez = (0, 0, 1) is given in terms of the

direction cosine matrix C as

m = ˜C3 · j,

where

˜C3 = ( ˜C31, ˜C32, ˜C33)

= (− sin θ cos ψ, sin θ sin ψ, cos θ),

is the vector of body-ﬁxed components of ez.

2.3. Determination of relative equilibria

As the angle φ is ignorable, we consider relative equilibria deﬁned by the conditions ˙θ = 0,
and ˙ψ = 0 [30]. These relative equilibria in general deﬁne periodic orbits in the full rotor
phase space. Using these conditions in equations (2.11), and rewriting in terms of ˜C3 we

obtain

The equation for m, (2.12), can be rewritten as

which can be used to express ˙φ in terms of m and ˜C3. Substituting the resulting expression
for j,

into the Hamiltonian (2.9) gives the eﬀective or amended potential [6, 10, 30, 31] for an

asymmetric top molecule in collinear ﬁelds

In general the solutions of equation (2.18) depend on m. For a given m the zero set of ∂Vm
∂θ
∂ψ ) in the θ-ψ space gives the solution set for equation (2.18a) (respectively,
(2.18b)). The solution set typically consists of (possibly disjoint) curves in the θ-ψ plane.

In practice (see below), we are able to give a natural parametrization of each of these

∂Vm

solution curves, so that the general solution of equations (2.18) is obtained by evaluating
∂ψ (respectively ∂Vm
∂θ ) along each of the particular solution curves. Zeroes of the relevant
functions are found by interpolation along the curve, yielding values of θ and ψ that solve

(2.18) for given m. Finally, the eﬀective potential (2.17) is evaluated at each of these solution

points, which in general have diﬀerent energies for a given m. The calculation is repeated

for diﬀerent values of m to obtain the complete E-m diagram.

To clarify the general procedure just outlined, consider the Euler problem (free asym-

metric top), with ω = ∆ω2 = ∆ω3 = 0. Equations (2.18) in this case are

The common denominator is never zero, and is suﬃcient to ﬁnd the zeros in the numerators.

The solutions θ = 0, π satisfy both equations simultaneously giving the solution set A =

{0, π} × [0, 2π).

In the cartesian product the ﬁrst set gives the possible values of the θ

coordinate, the second set the possible values of the ψ coordinate.

Setting ψ = 0, π/2, π, or 3π/2 solves Eq. (2.21b); substituting these values into (2.21a)

gives

sin θ cos θ (I3 − I1) m2 = 0, ψ = 0, π,

sin θ cos θ (I3 − I2) m2 = 0, ψ = π/2, 3π/2.

solutions are B = {π/2} × {0, π}, and C = {π/2} × {π/2, 3π/2}.

The complete solution set for the Euler problem is SE = A ∪ B ∪ C. For each of these

sets is possible to obtain a Vm-m curve simply by evaluating the eﬀective potential on each

The E-m diagram consists of three parabolas and the regions enclosed between them.

This diagram is shown in Fig. 1 for the three molecules considered here (cf. §3.4 of Ref. 6;

Ch. 14 of Ref. 10). The diﬀerent lines represent the three parabolas (2.23) and correspond

physically to rotations of the top about the body ﬁxed axes (in a positive or negative sense).

The region below the red curve is physically inaccessible. In the axis convention used to

obtain the asymmetric top Hamiltonian the red curve, equation (2.23b), corresponds to

stable rotation about the body ﬁxed x-axis; the green parabola, equation (2.23c), to an

unstable rotation about the y-axis, and the blue curve to a stable rotation about the z-axis.

For a given (E,m) point in Fig. 1, the eﬀective potential (2.17) gives an equation to

solve in θ or ψ. The solutions are found as contours of constant Vm = E in the θ-ψ

conﬁguration space, the Poisson sphere S2. These contours deﬁne the classically accessible

(Vm 6 E) and forbidden (Vm > E) regions for given E and m. The topology of the diﬀerent

solutions on the (θ, ψ) sphere is characterized by the (multi-valued) genus [6], which for

every connected classically allowed region counts the number of disjoint discs associated

with forbidden motion that are removed from the sphere.

Figure 2 shows the classically accessible regions (in black) of S2 for iodopentaﬂuoroben-

zene. Panel 2(a) represents an (E,m) point located between the red and green parabolas

in Fig. 1(c); the multivalued genus is 1,1 since there are two disjoint classically accessible

regions and from the point of view of each there is one white disc removed from the sphere.

In the same way, panel 2(b) is the accessible region for a (E,m) point located between

the green and blue parabolas of 1(c), but now the genus is 2 since two white discs are re-

moved. Finally the region above the blue parabola in 1(c) has 0 genus since all the sphere

10

is classically accessible (panel 2(c)).

3. E-m DIAGRAM FOR ASYMMETRIC TOP MOLECULES IN STATIC ELEC-

TRIC FIELDS

Energy-momentum diagrams for the asymmetric top in an external gravitational ﬁeld

have been studied by Katok [30] and by Gashenenko and Richter [51]. An important con-

clusion in these works is that, in the study of relative equilibria and their bifurcations in

asymmetric tops, the relevant parameters are the ratios between two of the moments of

inertia and the third one, e.g., I1/I3 and I2/I3.

In this section we treat as examples three asymmetric top molecules of recent theoretical

and experimental interest [17, 39]: the near-prolate top iodobenzene (C6H5I) [21, 53], the

near-oblate top pyridazine (C4H4N2) [17, 20], and the intermediate case iodopentaﬂuoroben-

zene [21]. Relevant physical parameters for these molecules are given in Table I.

In Fig. 3 we show the deﬁnition of the body ﬁxed frame for these molecules. The moment

of inertia Ii is related to the rotational constant Bi by Bi = (2Ii)−1. The rotational constants

Bi, the ﬁeld parameter ω, and the energy are all scaled by B3. For iodobenzene an electric
ﬁeld of εS = 25 kVcm−1 [53] gives ω/B3 = 4.52; for pyridazine a ﬁeld of strength εS =
56 kVcm−1 [20] gives ω/B3 = 19.04; in iodopentaﬂuorobenzene, an electric ﬁeld of εS =
25 kVcm−1 gives ω/B3 = 18.93 [17, 21, 53].

For the asymmetric top molecule in an electric ﬁeld, the relative equilibria are found by

solving the equations (setting ∆ω2 = ∆ω3 = 0 in Equations (2.18)):

Again we have the solution set A = {0, π} × [0, 2π). There are two solution subsets A1 ⊂ A,

and A2 ⊂ A, given by A1 = {0} × [0, 2π), and A2 = {π} × [0, 2π). The Vm-m curves for

for ψ = 0, π and ψ = π/2, 3π/2 respectively, and i1 ≡ I1/I3, i2 ≡ I2/I3. For the case

I1 > I2 > I3, i.e., i1 > i2 > 1, the right hand sides (RHS) of these equations are functions

with maxima at θ = 0, π and a minimum at θ = π/2; the left hand sides (LHS) are functions

with a minimum at θ = 0, a maximum at θ = π, and a ﬁxed zero at θ = π/2. In Fig. 4, the

LHS and RHS of these equations are plotted in order to show the nature of the solutions.

As m is increased the amplitude of variation of the solid curve about zero gets larger until

it intersects the dashed line at θ = 0, at which point a solution of the equation is obtained.

Since the curves do not change their shape, there can exist only one solution for each of the

equations (3.4) for a given m. This unique intersection gives a value of θ, which together

with the respective ψ gives the solution of equations (3.4). The form of the curves indicates

that the intersection occurs initially at θ = 0 and then moves to larger values of θ as |m|

increases, i.e., the solution A1 bifurcates twice, ﬁrst for the ψ = 0, π curve and then for

the ψ = π/2, 3π/2 curve. Since the solid line is always zero at θ = π/2, the intersection

of the two curves cannot go beyond this point, this means that for large values of m the

asymmetric top in an electric ﬁeld behaves like an Euler top.

The bifurcations in the E-m and E-θ diagrams are shown in Fig. 5. For iodobenzene we

set ω/B3 = 10, for pyridazine ω/B3 = 20, and for iodopentaﬂuorobenzene ω/B3 = 20.

In the E-m diagrams there are four regions delimited by diﬀerent color curves. The

allowed conﬁguration space corresponding to the regions delimited by the red and green

curves have genus 1,1 ; those between the green and the blue curves have genus 2 ; between

the blue and magenta curves the genus is 1, and above the magenta curve the genus 0. It

can be seen that the only diﬀerence between these diagrams and those for the Euler top is

the presence of the region with genus 1.

The curves themselves represent rotations in φ at constant θ and ψ. Associated θ values

for given energy are shown using the curve colors in panels 5(b), (d), and (f). The red curve

is a stable rotation with ψ = 0, π and θ; the green curve is unstable with ψ = π/2, 3π/2 and

θ in the RHS panels. The blue and magenta curves are associated with degenerate equilibria

13

in the ψ coordinate and θ = 0 (stable, blue) or θ = π (unstable, magenta). Physically the

blue and magenta curves in Fig. 5 represent the situation when the molecule’s dipole is

oriented with the ﬁeld (blue) and against it (magenta), while at the same time the molecule

is rotating about its own z-axis with direction and angular velocity given by m.

From (4.2)-(4.3) it is seen that θ = 0, π are again simultaneous solutions and the ﬁrst

solution set is A = {0, π} × [0, 2π). In contrast with the electric ﬁeld case, the symmetry of

the laser interaction gives only one Vm-m curve for A,

Vm(A) =

{π/2} × {0, π/2, π, 3π/2}. There are two subsets, B1 ⊂ B and B2 ⊂ B, given by B1 =

{π/2} × {0, π} and B2 = {π/2} × {π/2, 3π/2}. For these the Vm-m curves are

for ψ = 0, π, and ψ = π/2, 3π/2 respectively, and as before i1 ≡ I1/I3 and i2 ≡ I2/I3,

with i1 > i2 > 1. The nature of the solutions depends on the values of ∆ω2 and ∆ω3. For

iodobenzene and pyridazine ∆ω3 > ∆ω2 > 0, since for these molecules α1 < α2 < α3 (cf.

Table I). This is however not always the case: for pyridine with the same axis convention

α1 < α3 < α2 [54], which implies ∆ω2 > ∆ω3 > 0.

For a physically reasonable laser intensity 1012 Wcm−2 applied to iodobenzene we have

∆ω2/B3 = 284.6 and ∆ω3/B3 = 630.5; the same ﬁeld applied to pyridazine produces

∆ω2/B3 = 225.7 and ∆ω3/B3 = 228.9;

iodobenzene gives ∆ω2/B3 = 2280.06 and

∆ω3/B3 = 4097.94. These dimensionless ratios are much larger than the corresponding

energy ratios for physically relevant values of the interaction with a static electric ﬁeld,

ω = 10 and ω = 20. As we wish to investigate the interesting dynamical regime in which

the eﬀects of both ﬁelds are of similar magnitude (see next Section), we reduce the intensity

of the laser by a factor of 10 to obtain the values listed in Table II.

The plot of the RHS and LHS of equations (4.7) is shown in Fig. 6. The situation

is diﬀerent from the static electric ﬁeld case. Now the LHS of the equations, the solid

horizontal line, moves down as m increases. This line intersects the RHS curve (dashed) at

θ = 0, π simultaneously for m values

for ψ = 0, π and ψ = π/2, 3π/2, respectively. As the value of m increases the points

of intersection approach the value θ = π/2 symmetrically, i.e., π/2 − θleft = θright − π/2.

diagram the solution set C is a bridge connecting solutions A and B1. In like fashion the

(cid:3)

(cid:3)

solution set D connects the solutions A and B2.

Finally, the last solution set is obtained from equations (4.2) after removing all the

In general this equality is not satisﬁed for physical parameter values. For example, table II

lists the LHS and RHS of equation (4.16) for the molecules of interest.

As condition (4.15) is not fulﬁlled for the molecules considered here, the last solution set

is empty, E = ∅. The complete solution for the asymmetric top rotor in a linearly polarized

laser ﬁeld is then given by SL = A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D. The Vm-m curves for these solutions in the

case of iodopentaﬂuorobenzene, iodobenzene and pyridazine are shown in Figs 7, 8, and 9,

respectively. In these ﬁgures the solution sets are given by diﬀerent types of curves. The

solution set A is given by the red curve, B1 by the green curve and B2 by the blue. The

bridge solution sets C, connecting A with B1 are magenta; the bridge D, connecting A with

B2, is the cyan curve.

For iodopentaﬂuorobenzene and iodobenzene there are nine diﬀerent regions delimited by

diﬀerent curve types with their corresponding genera indicated with arrows in Fig. 8. The

classically accessible θ-ψ conﬁguration space for each of these regions is shown in Fig. 10.

The simplest region is characterized by genus 0 ; in this region the molecule is free to move

in any possible conﬁguration in θ-ψ as can be seen in Fig. 10(i). There are two regions with

genus 2 : one for high energy and large m, the other for low energy and small m. In the

high energy region 10(a) shows that the molecule is localized in the equatorial region and

the poles are forbidden. The second region with genus 2 is shown in 10(c); in this case the

forbidden regions are on the equator with ψ = 0, π. For genus 4 there is only one region,

shown in panel 10(f); the molecule can access neither the poles nor the equatorial regions

with ψ = 0, π. In the case of genus 2,2, panel 10(d), the accessible region is delocalized in ψ

and restricted in θ to a region close, but not on, the poles. Finally, for genus 1,1,1,1 (10(f))

the motion is highly localized near θ = π/4, 3π/4 and ψ = π/2, 3π/2.

18

The fact that both the inertia and polarizability tensors of pyridazine have near-oblate

symmetry makes it harder to observe the diﬀerent regions in the E-m diagram, as can be

seen from Fig. 9. As I2 ≈ I3 and ∆ω2 ≈ ∆ω3, the Vm-m curves for the solution sets A and

B2 are very similar. The magenta bridging solution C connecting A and B1 is easily seen, but

the cyan D bridge is much harder to see. As for iodopentaﬂuorobenzene and iodobenzene,

there are 9 diﬀerent regions which have the same distribution of genus.

5. E-m DIAGRAMS FOR ASYMMETRIC TOP MOLECULES IN COLLINEAR

FIELDS

We now consider the rotational dynamics of dipolar asymmetric tops in combined static

(Section 3) and nonresonant laser (Section 4) ﬁelds. The polarization of the laser ﬁeld is

taken to be collinear with the static ﬁeld, so that m is a conserved quantity.

A related problem has been analyzed by Tatarinov [6, 31], who studied the problem of

the rotation of a rigid body about a ﬁxed point with a potential

V = P ˜C3 · RCM +

(I ˜C3) · ˜C3,

ρ
2

(5.1)

where P and ρ are constants, and RCM is the location of the center of mass relative to the

ﬁxed point. In Tatarinov’s work E-m diagrams and genera are obtained for the eﬀective

potential.

In molecular terms, the ﬁrst term of the potential (5.1) corresponds to the interaction of

an electric ﬁeld along the space-ﬁxed z-axis with the dipole moment of the molecule, where

the dipole moment vector can point in an arbitrary direction in the molecule-ﬁxed frame,

R, not only along the molecule ﬁxed z-axis as in the case studied here. The second term

of (5.1) has no obvious molecular analog, but the dependence on Euler angles is exactly the

same as for the laser interaction.

In fact, the potential energy for an asymmetric top in

tilted (non-collinear) ﬁelds can be written

V = −Ω · ˜C3 − (∆Ω ˜C3) · ˜C3,

(5.2)

with the deﬁnitions Ω ≡ (ω sin β, 0, ω cos β), and ∆Ω ≡ diag (0, ∆ω2, ∆ω3).

The eﬀective potential for the dipolar asymmetric top in collinear ﬁelds, where the dipole

moment points along the molecule-ﬁxed z-axis, is (cf. eq. (2.17))

Vm(θ, ψ) =

− ω cos θ − ∆ω2 sin2 θ sin2 ψ − ∆ω3 cos2 θ.

In both equations (5.4) the common factor sin θ gives the simultaneous solution θ = 0 or

π, so the ﬁrst solution set is A = {0, π} × [0, 2π). As for the static electric ﬁeld case, this

solution generates two subsets A1 = {0} × [0, 2π) and A2 = {π} × [0, 2π). The Vm-m curves

for these solutions are

Figures 11, 12 and 13 show plots of the LHS and RHS of equations (5.8) for iodopentaﬂu-

orobenzene (ω/B3 = 20, ∆ω2/B3 = 228.006 and ∆ω3/B3 = 409.794),

iodobenzene

(ω/B3 = 10, ∆ω2/B3 = 28.456 and ∆ω3/B3 = 63.05) and for pyridazine (ω/B3 = 20,

∆ω2/B3 = 22.56, and ∆ω3/B3 = 22.88).

Figures 11 and 12 show the LHS of (5.8) for iodopentaﬂuorobenzene and iodobenzene

(respectively) with m = 0 as a dotted line in both cases; it is clear that on each ﬁgure that for

m = 0 there is only one intersection at θ > π/2. As the value of m increases, the dashed curve

will intersect the solid line at additional points. The RHS of (5.8a) gives −I3 (ω + 2∆ω3)

at θ = 0 and −I3 (ω − 2∆ω3) at θ = π; for these two melecules in the ﬁelds speciﬁed above

|ω + 2∆ω3| > |ω − 2∆ω3|, which implies that the LHS curve intersects the RHS curve ﬁrst

at θ = π, and then at θ = 0. For larger m only the leftmost intersection remains with the

two intersections with θ > π/2 disappearing simultaneously. This situation is repeated for

the second equation (5.8), for which the RHS at θ = 0, π gives −I3 [ω − 2(∆ω2 − ∆ω3)] and

21

−I3 [ω + 2(∆ω2 − ∆ω3)] respectively; for the ﬁelds employed we have for both molecules

that |ω − 2 (∆ω2 − ∆ω3)| > |ω + 2 (δω2 − ∆ω3)|.

For pyridazine the situation is diﬀerent. From Fig. 13(a) it is clear that the RHS curve

of (5.8a) is intersected ﬁrst at θ = π, but the two solutions with θ > π/2 will now disappear

before the dashed curve intersects the solid curve at θ = 0. For (5.8b) there is only one

solution, which moves from θ = 0 to larger values of θ as the value of m increases.

Figures 11 to 13 explain the observed bifurcation structure of the solutions of equations

(5.8). The two panels in Figures 11 and 12 and panel 13(a) show the existence of a nonbi-

furcating solution and a pair of solutions emerging from a saddle-node bifurcation. A global

view of the bifurcations is obtained rearranging equations (5.8) to

cos θ (1 − i1) m2 + I3(ω + 2∆ω3 cos θ)

i1 + (1 − i1) cos2 θ

cos θ (1 − i2) m2 + I3 [ω − 2(∆ω2 − ∆ω3) cos θ]

(5.9a)

(cid:2)

and then plotting the zero contours of the LHS in the θ-m space. These contours are shown

in Fig. 14 for the molecules treated here. The contours indicate that a solution branch for

both equations (5.9) begins at θ = 0, branching out of the A1 solution. On the other side,

the right branch from the saddle-node pair begins at θ = π, which means that this solution

emerges from the A2 solution. The left branch of the saddle-node pair is connected only to

its right partner.

The last solution set is obtained after removing all common factors in equations (5.4),

and rearranging to obtain m2 as function of θ and ψ,

In contrast to equation (4.16), equation (5.13) depends on the ﬁelds. For the ﬁelds used in

iodobenzene we obtain θ = 0.4896π, while for pyridazine there is no solution.

The range of m for this solution is obtained from equation (5.10b). The smallest value

of m occurs at ψ = π/2, 3π/2, the largest at ψ = 0, π, giving the values

where i = 1 for ψ = 0, π, and i = 2 for ψ = π/2, 3π/2. A solution of (5.10) therefore exists

for m ∈ [M2, M1]. Noting equations (5.8), and keeping in mind equation (5.11), we conclude

that this solution coincides with the solution of (5.10a) at m = M2, and with the solution

of (5.10b) at m = M1.

Using equations (5.10b) and (5.14) we obtain

where the last two terms are to be evaluated using equation (5.13). The ﬁrst term shows

a linear dependence on m.

In fact, as seen above, this solution is a bridge between the

solutions of (5.8) at ψ = π/2, 3π/2 and ψ = 0, π. Although it has not been considered, for

negative values of m the solutions are symmetric with respect to reﬂection on the m = 0

line.

The E-m diagram for iodopentaﬂuorobenzene is shown in Fig. 15. There are 16 diﬀerent

regions delimited by the Vm-m curves. In the ﬁgure there are two parabolas corresponding

to the solution sets A1 (red) and A2 (green), the A1 parabola is always below the A2 as

should be evident from equations (5.7). Emerging from the A1 parabola at m ≈ 10 there

are two curves, one blue the other magenta. These curves correspond to the independent

branch solutions of equation (5.9), the blue curve is the solution for ψ = 0, π, the magenta

23

one for ψ = π/2, 3π/2. These two curves intersect near m ≈ 50, and near this intersection

they are connected by the bridge solution (5.16) (cyan). Emerging from the A2 curve, near

m ≈ 10, there are also two curves with the same colors as above; these are the two saddle-

node bifurcation solutions of equation (5.9) with the blue curve for the ψ = 0, π solution and

the magenta curve for the ψ = π/2, 3π/2 solution. The saddle-node bifurcation are observed

as cusps near m ≈ 40 for the blue curve and m ≈ 25 for the cyan curve. The complete E-m

diagram is obtained when negative values of m are considered, the diagram is symmetric

about the m = 0 axis. For the full diagram the bifurcation partners form “smiles” that are

typical features of this type of system [31] (for analogous structures in the case of diatomic

molecules in collinear ﬁelds, see [25]).

The accessible θ-ψ conﬁguration space for the diﬀerent regions of Fig. 15 is shown in Fig.

16. Comparing with the ﬁgure for the laser interaction only (Fig. 10), we see that the genus

2,2, panel 10(d), is not present when the electric ﬁeld is turned on; instead, there is a genus

1,2 region, panel 16(l). This indicates that the eﬀect of the electric ﬁeld is relatively strong

compared to the laser and that it tends to align the molecule dipole along the space ﬁxed

z-axis. This is also the case for the genus 3 region of Fig. 16(j), which is absent in Figure

10. Note also that the genus 1,1,1,1 conﬁgurations are diﬀerent in both ﬁgures.

For iodobenzene the E-m diagram, Fig. 17, is simpler than the one for iodopenﬂuoroben-

zene, Fig. 15. Since the rotational constants for this molecule are considerably larger than

those for iodopentaﬂuorobenzene, the E-m diagram extends over a smaller energy range.

There are only few qualitative changes with respect to Fig. 15. The most important diﬀer-

ence is that the lower smile lies completely within the 2 region and does not go over to the

1,1 region as for iodopentaﬂuorobenzene. This eliminates the lower 2 region observed in

the lower panel of Fig. 15 and also the 1,1 region in the same panel.

The E-m diagrams for pyridazine are shown in Fig. 18. In panel (a), where ω/B3 = 20,

∆ω2/B3 = 22.56, and ∆ω3/B3 = 22.88, we obtain a very simple E-m diagram with only 6

regions. There is only one “smile” with genera 2 and 3. The second smile does not form

since there is only one branch for the ψ = π/2, 3π/2 solution. In panel (b) we show the

E-m diagram for the same value of electric ﬁeld but for a laser ﬁeld 10 times more intense.

In this case, the smile has grown bigger, overlapping the regions with genera 1, 2, and 1,1.

It is observed that below and above the overlapped regions the genus is the same as for

the weaker laser ﬁeld case, while inside the smile the genus can vary according to the E-m

24

values.

6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have studied the classical mechanics of rotational motion of dipolar

asymmetric top molecules in strong external ﬁelds. Static electric ﬁelds, linearly polarized

nonresonant laser ﬁelds, and collinear combinations of the two were investigated. The par-

ticular asymmetric top molecules iodobenzene, pyridazine and iodopentaﬂuorobenzene have

been treated for physically relevant ﬁeld strengths.

Following Katok [30] and Tatarinov [31], we have computed diagrams of relative equlibria

in the E-m plane; the relative equilibria correspond physically to periodic motions with the

two Euler angles θ and ψ constant [6, 30]. We have also examined the classically allowed

θ-ψ conﬁguration space for diﬀerent regions of the E-m diagrams, and have classiﬁed the

conﬁguration space topology according to their genus [6]. We anticipate that this classi-

cal mechanical investigation will be useful in the diﬃcult problem of assigning quantum

mechanical eigenstates and energy levels for asymmetric tops in external ﬁelds [42, 43].

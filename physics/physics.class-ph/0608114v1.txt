Abstract

Mechanical Maxwell’s demons, such as Smoluchowski’s trapdoor and Feynman’s ratchet and

pawl need external energy source to operate.

If you cease to feed a demon the Second Law

of thermodynamics will quickly stop its operation. Nevertheless, if the parity is an unbroken

symmetry of nature, it may happen that a small modiﬁcation leads to demons which do not need

feeding. Such demons can act like perpetuum mobiles of the second kind: extract heat energy

from only one reservoir, use it to do work and be isolated from the rest of ordinary world. Yet

the Second Law is not violated because the demons pay their entropy cost in the hidden (mirror)

sector of the world by emitting mirror photons.

INTRODUCTION

“The law that entropy always increases - the second law of thermodynamics - holds, I

think, the supreme position among the laws of nature.

If someone points out that your

pet theory of the universe is in disagreement with Maxwell’s equations - then so much the

worse for Maxwell’s equations. If it is found to be contradicted by experiments - well, these

experimentalists do bungle things sometimes. But if your theory is found to be against the

second law of thermodynamics I can give you no hope; there is nothing for it but to collapse

in deepest humiliation” [1]. Following Eddington’s this wise advice, I will not challenge

the Second Law in this article. Demonic devices I consider are by no means malignant to

the Second Law and their purpose is not to oppose it but rather to demonstrate possible

subtleties of the Law’s realization in concrete situations.

This philosophy is much in accord with Maxwell’s original intention who introduced “a

very observant and neat-ﬁngered being”, the Demon, as a means to circumscribe the domain

of validity of the Second law and in particular to indicate its statistical nature [2, 3, 4].

Later, however, it became traditional to consider demons as a threat to the Second Law

to be deﬁed. Modern exorcisms use information theory language and it is generally accepted

that the Landauer’s principle [5, 6, 7] ﬁnally killed the demon.

But, as Maxwell’s demon was considered to be killed several times in the past and every

time it resurrected from dead, we have every reason to suspect this last information theory

exorcism [3, 8, 9] and believe the old wisdom that “True demons cannot be killed at all”

[10].

The problem with all exorcisms can be formulated as a dilemma [8]: either the whole

combined system the demon included forms a canonical thermal system or it does not. In

the ﬁrst case the validity of the Second Law is assumed from the beginning and therefore the

demon is predeﬁned to fail. The exorcism is sound but not profound, although sometimes

it can be enlightening and delightful.

In the second case it is not evident at all why anti-entropic behaviour can not happen.

For example, if Hamiltonian dynamics is abandoned, a pressure demon can readily be con-

structed [11]. One needs a new physical postulate with independent justiﬁcation to ensure

the validity of the Second Law for the combined system. Although Landauer’s principle can

be proved in several physical situations [12, 13] its generality is not suﬃcient to exorcise all

2

conceivable extraordinary demons. For example, the Landauer’s principle, as well as ordi-

nary Gibbsian thermodynamics, fails in the extreme quantum limit then the entanglement

is essential and the total entropy is not the sum of partial entropies of the subsystems [14].

According to Boltzmann, “The second law of thermodynamics can be proved from the

mechanical theory if one assumes that the present state of the universe, or at least that part

which surrounds us, started to evolve from an improbable state and is still in a relatively

improbable state. This is a reasonable assumption to make, since it enables us to explain

the facts of experience, and one should not expect to be able to deduce it from anything

more fundamental” [15]. But how improbable? Roger Penrose estimates [15, 16] that the
initial state of the universe was absurdly improbable: one part in 1010123

. In the face of this

number, I think, you would rather welcome Maxwell’s demon than want to exorcise it. Of

course, recent approaches to the Low Entropy Past problem [17] do not involve demons, but

who can guarantee that the initial low entropy state was prepared without them? In any

case something more fundamental is clearly required to explain the puzzle and avoid sheer

impossibility of the world we observe around us.

It seems, therefore, that exorcism is not productive and it is better to allow the presence

of demons. However the notion of demons should be understood in broader sense: not only

creatures which challenge the Second Law, but also the ones which use the Second Law in

a clever and rather unexpected manner.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the ﬁrst sections we consider some classical

Maxwell demons. A rather detailed analysis of them is presented in the framework of the

Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations. I tried to make the exposition as self-contained as

possible, assuming that readers from the mirror matter community are as unfamiliar with

some subtleties of the Fokker-Planck equation, like Itˆo-Stratonovich dilemma, as was the

author months ago.

After demonstrating that the demons really work when the temperature diﬀerence be-

tween their two thermal baths is enforced, we speculate about a possibility that this tem-

perature diﬀerence can be naturally created if signiﬁcant amount of mirror matter is added

to one of the thermal reservoirs.

Mirror matter is a hypothetical form of matter expected to exist if nature is left-right

symmetric in spite of P and CP violations in weak interactions. An example from the

molecular physics is considered to support this possibility. We cite some review articles

3

where more detailed and traditional exposition of the mirror matter idea, as well as relevant

references, can be found.

The conclusion just ﬁnishes the paper with the cheerful remark that mirror matter demons

might be technologically very useful. Therefore it is worthwhile to search mirror matter

experimentally. It is remarked that one experiment which searches invisible decays of or-

thopositronium in vacuum is under way.

SMOLUCHOWSKI’S TRAPDOOR

Maxwell’s original demon operates a tiny door between two chambers ﬁlled with gas

allowing only fast molecules to pass in one direction, and only slow ones to pass in opposite

direction. Eventually a temperature diﬀerence is generated between the chambers. The

demon can be just some purely mechanical device to avoid complications connected with

the demon’s intellect and information processing. If this device is assumed to be subject of

conventional thermodynamics (the sound horn of the dilemma mentioned above) then the

demon can succeed only if it hides entropy somewhere else. A very clever way how to do

this was indicated recently [18].

FIG. 1: Sand as Maxwell’s Demon [18].

4

In Fig.1 Maxwell’s demon left the door between two chambers ajar but this shrewd

creature had replaced the molecules in the chambers by sand grains and set the chambers

in vertical vibration by mounting them on a shaker. Usually sand grains distribute equally

to both sides. But if the vibration frequency is lowered below a critical value something

remarkable happens: the symmetry is spontaneously broken and grains settle preferentially

on one side. The sand grains act as a Maxwell’s demon! This is possible because, in contrast

to a molecular gas, collisions between grains of sand are not elastic and grains are simply

heated during the collisions, absorbing the entropy [18].

One of the oldest mechanical Maxwell’s demon is the Smoluchowski’s trapdoor [19]. Two

chambers ﬁlled with gas are connected by an opening that is covered by a spring-loaded

trapdoor. Molecules from one side tend to push the door open and those on the other side

tend to push it closed. Naively one expects that this asymmetry in the construction of the

door turns it into a one-way valve which creates a pressure diﬀerence between the chambers.

Smoluchowski argued that the thermal ﬂuctuations of the door will spoil the naive picture

and prohibit it to act as a one-way valve, although he did not provide detailed calculations

to prove this fact conclusively. It is diﬃcult to trace the trapdoor demon analytically to see

how it fails, but the corresponding computer simulations can be done and the results show

that Smoluchowski was right [19, 20].

The simulations show that the pressure diﬀerence between the chambers is exactly what

is expected at equilibrium after the trapdoor’s ﬁnite volume is taken into account. Therefore

the trapdoor can not act as a pressure demon.

But if the trapdoor is cooled to reduce its thermal ﬂuctuations the demon becomes

successful and indeed creates a measurable pressure diﬀerence between the chambers. In

simulation program the eﬀective cooling of the door is maintained by periodically removing

energy from the door then it is near the central partition. As a result the door remains near

the closed position longer than would occur without the cooling and it indeed operates as a

one-way valve [19, 20].

The entropy decrease due to this pressure demon is counterbalanced by the entropy

increase in the refrigerator that cools the door below the ambient gas temperature. However

the demonstration of this fact in computer simulations involves some subtleties [20].

5

FEYNMAN’S RATCHET AND PAWL

Close in spirit to the Smoluchowski’s trapdoor is Feynman’s ratchet and pawl mechanism

[21]. The device (Fig.2) contains a box with some gas and an axle with vanes in it. At the

other end of the axle, outside the box, there is toothed wheel and a pawl that pushes on the

cogwheel through a spring.

FIG. 2: Feynman’s ratchet and pawl engine [21].

If the paddle wheel is small enough, collisions of gas molecules on the vanes will lead

to Brownian ﬂuctuations of the axle. But the ratchet on the other end side of the axle

allows rotation only in one direction and blocks the counter-rotation. Therefore one expects

Feynman’s ratchet and pawl engine to rectify the thermal ﬂuctuations in a similar manner

as the use of ratchets allow windmills to extract useful work from random winds.

At closer look, however, we realize that the miniature pawl would itself be subject to

thermal ﬂuctuations that invalidate its rectiﬁcation property.

In isothermal conditions,

when the vanes have the same temperature as the ratchet and pawl, the Second Law ensures

that the rate of rotations in a wrong direction due to the pawl’s thermal bounces just

compensates the rate of the favorable rotations so that the wheel does a lot of jiggling but

no net turning. However if the temperatures are diﬀerent the rate balance no more holds

and the ratchet and pawl engine really begins to rotate [21, 22, 23, 24].

Yet there are some subtleties and by way of proof it is better to go into some details by

modeling the ratchet and pawl machine by the following Langevin equations [25]:

= F (θ1) − k(θ1 − θ2) + f1(t),

λ

λ

dθ1
dt
dθ2
dt

6

= k(θ1 − θ2) + f2(t),

(1)

where θ1 and θ2 are the angular positions of the ratchet and the windmill respectively, λ is
the friction coeﬃcient assumed to be the same for both baths, F (θ1) = − ∂U

∂θ1 is the torque
the ratchet experiences due to an asymmetric potential U(θ1) of its interaction with the

pawl. It is assumed that the ratchet and the windmill are connected by an elastic spring of

rigidity k. Finally, f1(t) and f2(t) represent Brownian random torques on the ratchet and

on the windmill respectively due to thermal ﬂuctuations. It is assumed that these random

torques constitute two independent Gaussian white noises

< fi(t) >= 0, < fi(t) fj(t′) >= 2kBTiλ δij δ(t − t′),

kB being the Boltzmann constant. These Langevin equations correspond to the over-dumped

regime (with neglected inertia).

It is more convenient to introduce another set of angular variables

1

Θ =

(θ1 + θ2),

θ =

(θ1 − θ2).

2

It is the variable Θ which describes the net rotation of the system and is, therefore, the only

object of our interest, while the variable θ describes the relative motion and is irrelevant for

our goals. In terms of these variables, equations (1) read

F (Θ + θ) +

[f1(t) + f2(t)] ,

λ ˙Θ =

λ ˙θ =

F (Θ + θ) − 2kθ +

[f1(t) − f2(t)] .

(4)

The relative rotation θ arises due to the Brownian jiggling of the ratchet and of the windmill

and hence is expected to be very small. Therefore one can expand

F (Θ + θ) ≈ F (Θ) + θ F ′(Θ), F ′(Θ) ≡

dF
dΘ

.

Besides, the dynamics of the variable θ is very rapid and at any time scale, relevant for the

evolution of the slow variable Θ, the fast variable θ will be able to relax to a quasi-stationary
value given by setting ˙θ = 0 in the second equation of (4):

This allows to eliminate θ from (4) and arrive at the following equation for the relevant

variable Θ [25]:

θ ≈

F (Θ) + f1(t) − f2(t)
4k − F ′(Θ)

.

˙Θ = H(Θ) + g1(Θ)f1(t) + g2(Θ)f2(t),

and terms of the second and higher order in F ′(Θ)

4k were neglected.

The resulting Langevin equation (6) is the stochastic diﬀerential equation with multi-

plicative noises and, therefore, subject to the notorious Itˆo-Stratonovich dilemma [26, 27].

The problem is that stochastic integrals one needs to calculate various average values are

in general ill-deﬁned without additional interpretation rules (the white noise is a singular

object after all, like the Dirac’s δ-function). The most commonly used Itˆo and Stratonovich

interpretations of stochastic integrals lead to diﬀerent results when multiplicative noise is

present.

From the physics side, this ill-deﬁnedness may be understood as follows [27]. According
to (6) each δ-pulse in f1(t) or f2(t) gives rise to a pulse in ˙Θ and hence an instantaneous

jump in Θ. Then it is not clear which value of Θ should be used in g1(Θ) and g2(Θ): the

value just before the jump, after the jump, or some average of these two. Itˆo prescription

assumes that the value before the jump should be used, while Stratonovich prescription

advocates for the mean value between before and after the jump.

Our manipulations, which led to (6) from (1), already assumes the Stratonovich interpre-

tation because we had transformed variables in (1) as if (1) were ordinary (not stochastic)

diﬀerential equations and this is only valid for the Stratonovich interpretation [27].

In fact there is a subtle point here. The naive adiabatic elimination of the fast variable
we applied for θ (by setting ˙θ = 0) not necessarily implies the Stratonovich interpretation

[28]. Depending on the ﬁne details of the physical system and of the limiting process, one

may end with Stratonovich, Itˆo or even with some other interpretation which is neither Itˆo

nor Stratonovich [28]. Nevertheless the Stratonovich interpretation will be assumed in the

following like as was done tacitly in [25].

Let P (Θ, t) be the probability density for the stochastic process Θ(t). Then

P (Θ, t) =

G(Θ, t; Θ0, t0) P (Θ0, t0) dΘ0,

t > t0,

where the Green’s function (the conditional probability density over Θ at time t under the

condition that Θ = Θ0 at t = t0) satisﬁes the initial value equation

G(Θ, t0; Θ0, t0) = δ(Θ − Θ0).

As the time interval ∆t is very short, the function G(Θ, t + ∆t; Θ0, t) can diﬀer from its

initial δ-function value only slightly by drifting and broadening a little which can be modeled

by the drift coeﬃcient D(1)(Θ) and the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D(2)(Θ) respectively if we expand

[29]

G(Θ, t + ∆t; Θ0, t) ≈ δ(Θ − Θ0) + D(1)(Θ0) ∆t δ(1)(Θ − Θ0) + D(2)(Θ0) ∆t δ(2)(Θ − Θ0), (11)

where δ(n)(Θ) denotes the n-th order derivative of the δ-function with the basic property

BRILLOUIN’S DEMON

Although Feynman’s ratchet and pawl gadget is fascinating, its experimental realization

is doubtful because it does not seem feasible to arrange the necessary temperature gradient

at nanoscale without generating violent convective currents in ambient material [23]. In this

respect its electrical counterpart, the Brillouin diode demon is more promising.

The Brillouin diode engine [31, 32] consists of a diode in parallel to a resistor and a

capacitor. Thermal noise in the resistor makes it the AC voltage source. Naively, one expects

the diode to rectify this AC voltage and the capacitor to become self-charged. However the

Second Law prohibits such a demon devise to operate unless the diode and the resistor are

kept at diﬀerent temperatures – in complete analogy with the ratchet and pawl engine.

Both the Feynman ratchet and pawl gadget [22, 23] and the diode engine [33] are very

ineﬃcient thermal engines with eﬃciencies far below the Carnot value. The reason is that

they operate irreversibly due to a unavoidable heat exchange between the two thermal

reservoirs the engine is simultaneously in contact. In the ratchet and pawl case, it is the

mechanical coupling between the vanes and the ratchet which induces, via ﬂuctuations, a

heat transfer between the reservoirs, even under negligible thermal conductivity of the axle

[22].

then

It was shown in [34] that the heat exchange between the reservoirs of the diode engine is

signiﬁcantly reduced if the resistor in the circuit is replaced by the second diode switched

in the opposite direction as shown in Fig.3. Let us analyze this system considering diodes

as just nonlinear resistors [34].

If u is the voltage of the capacitor and i1, i2 are currents through two nonlinear resistors

i1R1(u) + u = v1(t) and i2R2(u) + u = v2(t),

(29)

where v1(t) and v2(t) are Nyquist stochastic electromotive forces [35], due to thermal agita-

tion in the corresponding resistors, satisfying [36]

< vi(t) > = 0, < vi(t) vj(t′) > = 2kBTiRi δij δ(t − t′).

(30)

But i1 + i2 = ˙q, where q = Cu is the charge of the capacitor with capacitance C. Therefore

(29) indicate the following Langevin equation

as should be expected for the capacitor’s energy in thermal equilibrium. The Boltzmann

distribution is symmetric in u and therefore < u > = 0. Not surprisingly, the Second Law

wins in isothermal situation irrespective of the volt-ampere characteristics of the diodes, and

no self-charging of the capacitor takes place.

If temperatures are diﬀerent, however, the distribution (34) is no more symmetric (note

that for identical diodes R2(u) = R1(−u)). Therefore, if you feed the Brillouin demon

with an external energy input, which maintains the necessary temperature diﬀerence, it will

operate successfully.

Let us now consider the heat exchange between the two thermal baths [36, 37]. During a

small time period ∆t, the electromotive force v1 performs a work

i1v1dt and therefore this

amount of energy is taken from the ﬁrst thermal bath at temperature T1. But a part of this

zero. This fact was indeed demonstrated in [34].

MIRROR WORLD AND HOW IT CAN ASSIST DEMONS

Mirror world was introduced in 1966 by Kobzarev, Okun, and Pomeranchuk [38] (a ﬁrst-

hand historical account can be found in [39]), although the basic idea dates back to Lee

and Yang’s 1956 paper [40] and subsequently was rediscovered in the modern context of

renormalizable gauge theories in [41].

The idea behind mirror matter is simple and can be explained as follows [42]. The naive

parity operator P, representing the space inversion, interchanges left and right. But in

16

case of internal symmetries, when there are several equivalent left-handed states and several

equivalent right-handed states, it is not a priori obvious what right-handed state should

correspond to a given left-handed state. All operators of the type SP, where S is an internal

symmetry operator, are equivalent. If we can ﬁnd some internal symmetry M, for which MP

remains unbroken in the real world, then we can say that the world is left-right symmetric

in over-all because MP is as good as the parity operator, as is P itself.

What remains is to ﬁnd an appropriate internal symmetry M. Not every choice of M

leads to the mirror world in a sense of a decoupled hidden sector. For example, the most

economical ﬁrst try is the charge conjugation operator C in the role of M [43, 44, 45]. In

this case mirror world coincides with the world of antiparticles. But CP is not conserved

and therefore such a world is not left-right symmetric.

Then the most natural and secure way to enforce the left-right symmetry is to double

our Standard Model world by introducing a mirror twin for every elementary particle in

it and arrange the right-handed mirror weak interactions, so that every P-asymmetry in

ordinary world is accompanied by the opposite P-asymmetry in the hidden mirror sector.

This new mirror sector must be necessarily hidden, that is only very weak interactions

between mirror and ordinary particles may be allowed, otherwise this scenario will come to

immediate conﬂict with phenomenology [38].

If the parity symmetry in our world is indeed restored at the expense of the hidden mirror

sector, many interesting phenomenological and astrophysical consequences follow that were

discussed many times in the literature. It would be boring to repeat all this here. Therefore

I cite only some review articles [39, 46, 47, 48, 49] where relevant references can be found.

Instead of following the well-known trails, I choose a new pathway to the mirror world, with

boron triﬂuoride (BF3) as our rather exotic guide.

Boron triﬂuoride is a highly toxic, colorless, nonﬂammable gas with a pungent odor, used

heavily in the semiconductor industry. But what is relevant for us here is the shape of its

planar molecule. Three ﬂuorine atoms seat at the corners of a equilateral triangle with the

boron atom in the center. This shape is obviously parity invariant, with parity identiﬁed

with the reﬂection in the y-axis of the x − y plane. But the world is quantum mechanical

after all and what is obvious from the classical point of view often ceases to be obvious in

quantum world. So we need a quantum theory of shapes [50, 51].

Let us consider rotations of the boron triﬂuoride molecule. The translational motion is

17

ignored as it does not lead to anything non-trivial. Therefore it will be assumed that the

center of the molecule with the boron atom at it is ﬁxed at the origin. Then any conﬁguration

of the ﬂuorine atoms can be obtained from a standard conﬁguration, with one of the ﬂuorine

atoms at the positive y-axis, by some rotation

R(φ) = 

cos φ sin φ

− sin φ cos φ

.



But rotations by φ = 2π



3 n, n-integer transform the molecule into itself because of symmetry
of the equilateral triangle. Therefore the conﬁguration space for the rotational motion of




the boron triﬂuoride molecule is the coset space

Q = SO(2)/Z3,

where Z3 is the cyclic subgroup of SO(2) generated by R(2π/3).

Topologically SO(2) is the same as the unite circle S1 and is thus inﬁnitely connected,

because loops with diﬀerent winding numbers around the circle belong to the diﬀerent ho-

motopy classes. The conﬁguration space Q is obtained from S1 by identifying points related
by rotations with φ = 2π

3 n, n-integer. Therefore Q is also inﬁnitely connected. The multiple
connectedness brings a new ﬂavour in quantization and makes it not quite trivial [52, 53].

For our goals, the convenient approach is the one presented in [54, 55] for quantum mechanics

Naively one expects the free dynamics of any quantum planar-rotator, such as the boron

triﬂuoride molecule, to be deﬁned by the Hamiltonian

on the circle S1.

where (¯h = 1)

is the angular momentum operator satisfying the canonical commutation relation

(37)

(38)

(39)

However, there are many pitfalls in using the commutation relation (39) in the context of the

quantum-mechanical description of angle variable [56]. The locus of problems lies in the fact
that ˆφ is not a good position operator for the conﬁguration space Q, as it is multi-valued.

ˆH =

ˆL2
2I

,

ˆL = −i

∂
∂φ

[ ˆφ, ˆL] = i.

18

Classically every point from Q is uniquely determined by a complex number q = exp (−3iφ).

Therefore one can expect that the unitary operator

ˆq = exp (−3i ˆφ),

(40)

(41)

is more suitable as the position operator on Q [57]. From (39) we expect the commutation

relations

[ ˆL, ˆq] = −3 ˆq,

[ ˆL, ˆq+] = 3 ˆq+,

which we assume to hold, although the self-adjoint angular momentum operator has not

necessarily have to be in the naive form (38).

The representation of the algebra (41) is simple to construct [54, 55]. The operator ˆL,

being self-adjoint, has an eigenvector |α > with a real eigenvalue 3α:

ˆL |α > = 3α |α >, < α|α > = 1.

The commutation relations (41) show that ˆq and ˆq+ = ˆq−1 act as lowering and rising

operators because

ˆL ˆq |α > =

[ ˆL, ˆq] + ˆq ˆL
(cid:17)

(cid:16)

Therefore we can consider the states

|α > = 3(α − 1)ˆq |α > and ˆL ˆq+ |α > = 3(α + 1)ˆq+ |α > .

|n + α > =

|α >, n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .

n

ˆq+

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

as spanning the Hilbert space H(α) where the fundamental operators ˆL and ˆq are realized,
because, as it follows from the self-adjointness of ˆL and unitarity of ˆq, the set of state vectors

|n + α > forms the orthocomplete system

< n + α|m + α > = δnm,

|n + α >< n + α| = 1.

The angular momentum operator is diagonal in this basis ˆL |n + α > = 3(n + α) |n + α >,

and so does the Hamiltonian (37). The energy eigenvalues are

En =

9(n + α)2
2I

.

(42)

For each α, there is a vacuum state corresponding to n = 0 and these vacuum states are

in general diﬀerent, like θ-vacuums in QCD. More precisely, H(α) and H(β) are unitary

∞

n=−∞
X

19

equivalent representation spaces of the algebra (41) if and only if the diﬀerence between α

and β is an integer [54, 55]. Therefore, in contrast to the canonical commutation relations,

the algebra (41) has inﬁnitely many inequivalent unitary representations parameterized by

a continuous parameter α from the interval 0 ≤ α < 1.

The spectrum (42) is doubly degenerate for α = 0, because in this case En = E−n, as well

as for α = 1/2, because then En = E−(n+1). For other values of α, there is no degeneracy.

This degeneracy reﬂects invariance under the parity transformation [55].

As we had already mentioned, geometrically the parity transformation is the reﬂection in

the y-axis, that is inversion of S1 around a diameter. Classically the parity transformation

moves the point speciﬁed by the angle φ to the one speciﬁed by the angle −φ, if we measure

an angular coordinate φ from the axis ﬁxed under the parity operation. Therefore it is
natural for the quantum mechanical unitary parity operator ˆP on Q to satisfy

ˆP + ˆq ˆP = ˆq+, ˆP + ˆL ˆP = − ˆL.

(43)

Such a parity operator is an automorphism of the fundamental algebra (41), but can not

always be realized in the Hilbert space H(α). Indeed,

ˆL ˆP |n + α > = − ˆP ˆL |n + α > = −3(n + α) ˆP |n + α >

shows that ˆP |n + α > does not in general lies in H(α), unless α = 0 or α = 1/2. Otherwise
ˆP |n + α > ∈ H(1−α). Therefore only for α = 0 or α = 1/2 is parity a good symmetry and

other realizations of quantum mechanics on Q break parity invariance. In later cases, to

restore parity invariance requires doubling of the Hilbert space by considering H(α) ⊕H(1−α).

It is rather strange that most realizations of the quantum shape of the boron triﬂuoride

molecule violate parity, although classically the molecule is reﬂection symmetric. After all

no microscopic source of parity violation was assumed in the molecular dynamics. How

then does parity violation emerge in the shape? This happens because we concentrated on

the slow nuclear degrees of freedom and completely neglected the fast electronic motion. A

general argument is given in [50, 51] that in a complete theory, with fast degrees of freedom

included, there is no parity violation. For example, in molecular physics the coupling between

rotational modes and the electronic wave functions lead to transitions between these wave

functions related by parity, with time scales much longer than typical rotational time scales.

As a result, parity invariance is restored but nearly degenerate states of opposite parity, the

parity doubles, appear in the molecular spectra.

20

To get an intuitive understanding why diﬀerent quantum theories are possible on Q and

why most of them violate parity, it is instructive to ﬁnd the explicit form for the angular

momentum operator in each α-realization [54, 55].

Let

∞

|θ > =

an |n + α >

n=−∞

be an eigenvector of the position operator ˆq+:

Then we get the recurrent relation

ˆq+ |θ > = e 3iθ |θ > .

an = e−3iθ an−1

and, therefore, up to normalization

|θ > = ei ω(θ)

e−3inθ |n + α >,

∞

n=−∞
X

where ω(θ) = ω(θ + 2π/3) is an arbitrary phase. But then

e−iλ ˆL |θ > = e−3iλα ei ω(θ) e−iω(θ+λ) |θ + λ > .

Let |ψ > be an arbitrary state vector. Diﬀerentiating the equality

< θ|eiλ ˆL|ψ >=

< ψ|e−iλ ˆL|θ >

= e3iλα e−iω(θ) ei ω(θ+λ) < θ + λ|ψ >

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

with respect to λ and taking λ = 0 in the result multiplied by −i, we get

As we see, the α-quantum theory on Q is analogous to the quantum theory on a unit

circle with the vector potential (45) along the circle. Then we have the magnetic ﬂux

~B · d~S =

~A · d~l = 6πα

Z

I

piercing the circle perpendicularly to the x − y plane. Classically a charged particle on the

circle does not feel the magnetic ﬂux, if the the magnetic ﬁeld on the circle is zero, but

quantum mechanically it does – the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect. Therefore it is not surprising

that we have many diﬀerent quantum theories, nor is it surprising that parity is violated

[58]. It is also clear that in a more complete theory, including sources of the magnetic ﬂux,

parity is not violated [58].

Now back to demons. Suppose parity invariance is indeed restored in a manner advocated

by mirror matter proponents. Then some non-gravitational interactions are not excluded

between the ordinary and mirror sectors. One interesting possibility is the photon-mirror

photon kinetic mixing interaction

L =

F µνF ′

µν,

ǫ
2

where F µν and F ′

µν are the ﬁeld strength tensors for electromagnetism and mirror electro-

magnetism respectively. As a result ordinary and mirror charged particles interact electro-

magnetically with the interaction strength controlled by the mixing parameter ǫ. A number

of observed anomalies can be explained from mirror matter perspective if

ǫ ∼ 5 · 10−9

(46)

(see [46] and references wherein).

Remarkably, this tiny electromagnetic interaction is nevertheless suﬃcient for thermal

equilibration to occur in a mixture of ordinary and mirror matter at Earth-like temperatures

[59], and to provide a force strong enough to oppose the force of gravity, so that a mirror

matter fragment can remain on the Earth’s surface instead of falling toward its center [60].

Demons considered above can clearly beneﬁt from this fact. What is necessary is to add a

signiﬁcant amount of mirror matter to the thermal reservoir we want to operate at colder

temperature. Mirror matter will draw in heat from the surrounding ordinary component of

the thermal bath and radiate it away as mirror photons. Thereby an eﬀective cooling will

take place and the necessary temperature diﬀerence will be created between the thermal

22

baths (assuming the another bath do not contain a mirror component), even if initially the

temperatures were the same.

Equation (36) indicates that, at least for some demons, heat exchange between two ther-

mal reservoirs of the demon can be made very low. Consequently, mirror matter walls of

the colder reservoir should radiate a very small ﬂux of mirror electromagnetic energy at

dynamical equilibrium and hence must be very cold. In fact, it appears that for signiﬁcant

amount of mirror matter the corresponding reservoir would be cooled to near absolute zero

where approximations of reference [59] break down. Therefore we refrain from any detailed

calculations.

CONCLUSION

As frequently stressed by Landau [39], we expect the world of elementary particles to

be mirror symmetric because the space itself is mirror symmetric. But weak interactions

turned out to be left-handed and heroic eﬀorts of Landau and others [43, 44, 45] to save

left-right symmetry by CP also failed. Therefore we are left with the strange fact that

nature is left-right asymmetric. But the example from the molecular physics considered

above suggests a possibility that the observed asymmetry might be just apparent, the result

of the fact that some fast degrees of freedom hidden, presumably, at the Planck scale, were

overlooked. Then in the more complete theory parity symmetry will be restored, but the

parity doubles will appear at the universe level in the form of mirror world [38, 41].

If nature is indeed organized in this manner, the fascinating Maxwell demons considered

in the previous sections can be made operative by just adding mirror matter to one of their

thermal reservoirs. Mirror matter demons can extract heat from one thermal reservoir, for

example from the world ocean, and transform it very eﬀectively (in case of Brillouin demon)

to some useful work, thereby solving the global energy problems of mankind!

All this “sounds too good to be true” [61]. But the principal question is whether mirror

matter exists. If it does indeed exist and if the photon-mirror photon mixing is not negligibly

small I do not see how the mirror demons can fail.

As for the photon-mirror photon mixing, the proposition that its magnitude is of the

order of (46) is experimentally falsiﬁable in near future, because such mixing leads to or-

thopositronium to mirror orthopositronium oscillations and as a result to invisible decays

23

of orthopositronium in vacuum, with intensities accessible in the experiment [62] which is

under way.

Maybe the putative perspective of using mirror matter demons will appear a little less

exotic if we recall that, in a sense, we are all made of demons. I mean that the Brownian

ratchet engines, which operate extremely eﬀectively and reliably, can be found in every bio-

logical cell [63, 64, 65]. Therefore I would be not much surprised if someday nanotechnology

will ﬁnd the mirror matter useful, provided, of course, that it exists at all.

The idea that mirror matter can ﬁnd applications in heat engines I credit to Saibal Mitra

[61]. But not his notes served as an inspiration for this investigation. The paper emerged

from J. D. Norton’s advise to be a little more critical about Landauer’s exorcism of Maxwell’s

demon in response to my rather careless claim in [66] that Landauer’s principle killed the

demon. “O King, most high and wise Lord; How incomprehensible are thy judgments, and

inscrutable thy ways!”

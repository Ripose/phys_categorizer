Lattice eﬀects on the kink families of two models for one-dimensional nonlinear Klein-Gordon sys-
tems with double-well on-site potentials are considered. The analytical expression of the generalized
Peierls-Nabarro pinning potential is obtained and confronted with numerical simulations.

Many physical problems have greatly contributed to the interest on double-well potential(DWP) models [1]. Among
the most important ones are the mechanism of protonic conductivity in molecular systems [2,3], structural instabilities
in one-dimensional(1D) Perovskyte-like systems [4] as well as Hydrogen-bonded ferroelectrics [5], and Peierls transition
in 1D conductors [6]. The ﬁrst problem ows its interest to the fundamental role of proton migrations among the
surrounding(heavy) ions of the 1D molecular system. The 1D character of these systems sits in the very high
conductivity along the Hydrogen-Bond(HB)-about 103 times greater-compared to the two other directions [7]. This
strong anisotropic conductivity relies on structural defects, that is ionic and bonding defects [8]. Defects are consequent
upon proton hopping and bond distortions across the energy barrier between the two most stretched proton positions
along the HB. When evoking ferroelectricity and the Peierls transition(an instability of the electronic structure of
a 1D electron-phonon system), the most natural framework is that of the Landau theory of second-order phase
transition [9]. The ”DWP” scheme in this theory is appropriate for such phenomena as the proton ordering transitions
in the pseudo-1D ferroelectrics KH2P O4 [5] and structural instabilities in 1D organic and inorganic conductors [6].
For all these systems, in an idealized context in the absence of external bias(electric or magnetic ﬁelds), defect
nucleations(soliton lattice) [10] and the intrinsic discrete structure of the background substrate lattice [11] are the
two main processes inﬂuencing conductivity. In general they give rise to an activated transport property that consists
either in a conducting phase or in an insulating phase [12,13]. In concrete terms, by the Kramers theory of diﬀusion it
is easy to point out that the kink diﬀusion coeﬃcient in a discrete medium will be weighted by an Arhenius-like factor
R(ωp) which accounts for the escape rate of kink from the lattice trapping. This factor depends on the vibration
frequency ωp of the kink in its attempts to jump across the pinning potential barrier, thereby determining its lifetime
in the discrete medium. At low temperatures, the discrete kink diﬀusion coeﬃcient is of the form

D

DoR(ωp),

R(ωp)

βEP N )

(1)

EP N in this formula is the lattice-induced trapping potential barrier, the kink pinning frequency ωp is directly con-
nected to this physical quantity. The activated diﬀusion coeﬃcient given above is not only interesting in its own right,
but also it furnishes relevant knowledge for capturing the essential features of all other transport parameters namely,
the kink mobility and conductivity.
While DWP models have so become useful in the understanding of physical problems, insights gained from the earliest
model i.e. the φ4 rapidly saturated owing to several shortcomings. For instance, the rigidity prevents from getting
further in the theory as to analytically account for the possibility of shifting the potential minima and hump to adjust
the model to a desired context. This has been particularly dramatic for molecular solids which backbones are often
so ﬂexible that chemical bonds must continuously relax or contract to avoid bond breakings. To overcome these
shortcomings, the Morse and double-Morse(DM) potentials were considered. Thus, the DM potential has been used
in the recent studies of the protonic conductivity [14] and the proton ordering transitions [15]. For this last context,
it has even been argued [15] that the DM model is to date the best candidate giving relatively good account of the
so-called ”geometric eﬀect” .
In addition to the DM, several other parametrized DWP models are currently present in the literature [16,17]. By
their essential virtues they allow theoretical manipulations at one wish. The present work deals with two versions
among the most general ones. A main question in the theory of parametrized DWP (PDWP) is their analytical
tractability. Indeed, except the soliton solutions that are often easy to obtain, several other physical quantities are
explicitely unaccessible. Even their statistical mechanics are most often proceeded numerically [18], or by transfer
integral methods which however can open only very narrow paths in the rather wide range of thermodynamic pa-
rameters of the system [19]. For the present two variants we will discuss the lattice discreteness properties to both
analytical and numerical viewpoints. We start by deriving a generalized analytical expression of the Peierls-Nabarro

1

potential(PNP) [12]. Next, we carry out a numerical analysis to get into the intimate discrete structure of each model.
By this last way we also provide an adequate framework to check the exactness of our analytical results.
Starting, consider a 1D nonlinear Klein-Gordon system whose dynamics can be described by the Hamiltonian:

For this value set, (3) is a DWP with variable positions of degenerate minima but ﬁxed potential hump.

for this second value set (3) is a DWP with ﬁxed minima but variable potential hump. In the continuum limit(x = nℓ,
where ℓ is the lattice spacing), the PDWP admits single-kink solutions explicitly given by:

dk in this last relation is the kink ”bare” width. At this step it is instructive to remark that according to the two
model parameters, only the ﬁrst will give rise to kink family whose widths eﬀectively vary(decrease) as function of
(with increasing)µ, whereas all kinks of the second family have their widths bounded to the constant dk whatever µ.
However, their ”kink shape” is deeply aﬀected by the deformability parameter as noticed elsewhere [17].
As our primary goal is the kink-lattice interactions, proceeding with we appeal to the PNP approach which assumes
the existence of an eﬀective potential ﬁeld provided by the lattice substrate and via which kinks get pinned due
to lattice discreteness. Several techniques are known for this problem. According to the recent [20](the collective-
coordinate method), lattice discreteness act on the kink in two diﬀerent aspects namely on the kink trajectory(time
dependence of the kink center-of-mass coordinate within the discrete PNP), and shape. The renormalization of the
kink shape(discreteness eﬀect-induced kink shape dressing) is though to be manifest of radiations by the pinned kink,
of discrete phonons as a shape response to the lattice discrete structure. To our knowledge there is yet a sound
experimental evidence of such phenomenon, so we will not consider this aspect. Moreover, we are interested in the
kink static conﬁguration which is a suitable approximation of the ”pinned-kink” conﬁguration so regular in structural
transition processes. Thus we are left with the sole problem of calculating the PNP. We start by writing the total
energy of the discrete system considering the static part of eq. (2):

We take only the real part of eq. (9) which is equivalent to restrict the sum over cosine harmonics. Otherwise, this
is consistent with the fact that G(n) is an even function of n. It turns out that the coeﬃcients of this series must be
determined by the following class of integrals:

The most indicated framework where to check the consistency of our analytical theory is the numerical treatment.
We performed the integration in (9) following an extended midpoint scheme. Results are displayed on ﬁgures 1 and
2 for arbitrary values of the deformability parameter µ. The main variable here is the dimensionless kink bare width
dk
0, where the two models reduce to the well-known φ4 model. Figures
ℓ . dk corresponds to the asymptotic limit µ
→
1a and 1b are the kink continuum energies at rest i.e. Ek = U o, while ﬁgures 2a and 2b represent the PNP barriers
EP N = U1. Curves are plotted in unit of MoC2
o . Though the ﬁgures indicate rather complex behaviours of the PNP
barrier with respect to µ, their most stricking feature is the drastic exponential fall-oﬀ of the pinning barrier with
increasing µ. For the ﬁrst model, this feature relates to the fact that the greater the deformability parameter the
narrower the kink. On the contrary, the kink width in the second model is independent on µ but however, one clearly
sees that the corresponding PNP barriers show almost the same dependence on µ as in the ﬁrst model.
The drastic fall-oﬀ of the PNP barriers can be interpreted in terms of the kinks the overcoming lattice pinning eﬀect.
Such a behaviour suggests an enhancement of the conducting regime in the discrete system at relatively narrow kink
widths. This sounds consistent with previous predictions [10,12,13,20] within the φ4 theory. otherwise, by tuning
the deformability parameter(which in the context of 1D molecular systems may correspond to adjust the equilibrium
positions of ions, for instance), it is expected that the correct order of magnitude of transport parameters of DWP
systems will be obtained with relatively best accuracy [23].

Ballistic trajectory: parabola, ellipse, or what?

Lior M. Burko and Richard H. Price
Department of Physics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 84112.

Mechanics texts tell us that a particle in a bound orbit under gravitational central force moves
on an ellipse, while introductory physics texts approximate the earth as ﬂat, and tell us that the
particle moves in a parabola. The uniform-gravity, ﬂat-earth parabola is clearly meant to be an
approximation to a small segment of the true central-force/ellipse orbit. To look more deeply into
this connection we convert earth-centered polar coordinates to “ﬂat-earth coordinates” by treating
radial lines as vertical, and by treating lines of constant radial distance as horizontal. With the
exact trajectory and dynamics in this system, we consider such questions as whether gravity is
purely vertical in this picture, and whether the central force nature of gravity is important only
when the height or range of a ballistic trajectory is comparable to the earth radius. Somewhat
surprisingly, the answers to both questions is “no,” and therein lie some interesting lessons.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The trajectory of a particle moving without drag under the inﬂuence of the gravitational ﬁeld of a perfectly spherical
earth is a conic section. Since a cannonball, for example, is on a bound orbit, its ﬂight from muzzle to target is part
of an ellipse, as shown on the left in Fig. 1. The center of the earth is at the (distant) focus of the highly eccentric
ellipse, and the part of the ellipse relevant to cannonball ﬂight is a small segment near the apogee. Introductory texts,
however, treat ballistic motion using Galileo’s approach. Speciﬁcally, the horizontal and vertical components of the
motion of the projectile are separated, and the trajectory is given by a parabola. The parabola as a limit of an ellipse
was noted by Newton in the Principia1:

If the ellipsis, by having its centre removed to an inﬁnite distance, degenerates into a parabola, the body
will move in this parabola; and the force, now tending to a centre inﬁnitely remote, will become equable.
Which is Galileo’s theorem.

Many of the introductory textbooks we have reviewed do not discuss the nature of the approximation, i.e., they
do not discuss the conditions under which the ﬂat-earth parabola is an accurate approximation for what is really a
central force ellipse. Some textbooks, however, do make explicit statements about the approximation, statements that
seem plausible, but turn out to be incorrect. Speciﬁcally, we found three classes of conditions which are used in those
textbooks that do discuss the validity of the approximation. In the ﬁrst class it is assumed that the maximal height
of the trajectory above the surface of the earth is small compared with the radius of the earth (or, equivalently, that
the magnitude of the gravitational acceleration does not change by much along the trajectory)2; in the second class
it is assumed that the range of the trajectory is small compared with the radius of the earth (or, equivalently, that
the direction of the gravitational acceleration does not change by much along the trajectory)3; in the third class it is
assumed that both the height and the range are small compared with the radius of the earth (both the magnitude and
the direction of the gravitational acceleration do not change by much)4. Other textbooks refer vaguely to neglecting
the curvature of the earth in justifying the approximation, but do not quantify the condition5.

In this paper we show that the correct condition under which the ﬂat-earth picture is a good approximation for the
trajectory, is that the maximal curvature of the trajectory is much greater than the curvature of the surface of the
earth. This condition coincides with the three classes of naive conditions for many, but not all, trajectories. There
are trajectories for which all the three naive classes of conditions are satisﬁed, but for which the approximation fails
to be valid.

To “ﬂatten the earth” without any approximation, we introduce geocentric polar coordinates r, φ in the plane of the
orbit (as shown on the left of Fig. 1) and we plot them (on the right in Fig. 1) as if they were Cartesian coordinates
x, y. We let R denote the radius of our perfect earth, and we take h to be the height, above the earth, of the peak
of the trajectory. The apogee of the particle orbit is then at a distance r = R + h from the center of the earth. For
convenience, we choose our zero of φ so that it coincides with the apogee of the orbit. In order to view the space
above the earth in this way, as if the earth were ﬂat, we need to distort the coordinates in somewhat the same manner
as a map maker. We choose to do this with the explicit relationship6

and to plot x, y as if they were Cartesian coordinates.

In this paper we shall focus on two questions about exact ballistic trajectories. The ﬁrst is the accuracy of the
parabolic approximation. The naive expectation of most students (and many teachers) is that the approximation is

x = (R + h)φ

y = r

valid if the trajectory is “small” compared to the radius of the earth, i.e. , if neither h nor the range of the trajectory
is comparable to the earth radius R. We shall see that this naive expectation is too naive.

Our second question involves the vertical nature of gravitation. In the “true” picture of gravitational acceleration,
on the left side of Fig. 1, the gravitational force is radially directed towards the center of the earth. These radial
lines are converted to vertical lines by the redrawing of the coordinates on the right hand side of Fig. 1, and by the
transformation in Eq. (1). It would seem, therefore, that gravitational acceleration must be acting vertically in the
picture on the right hand side of Eq. (1). The introductory textbooks add to this the assumption that g is constant,
and prove that a particle being acted upon only by gravitational forces moves in a parabola. This argument leads
unavoidably to the conclusion that the particle trajectory deviates from a parabola only due to the slight variation
of g with altitude. We shall see that again the naive expectation is not correct.

II. ELLIPTICAL ORBITS IN FLAT-EARTH COORDINATES

To describe the orbit of a unit mass particle we start by letting

represent the particle angular momentum per unit particle mass. With standard techniques7 we can write the equation
of the particle’s orbit, in polar coordinates, as

L = r2 dφ

r =

which is the equation of an ellipse (though not in the most familiar form). Here M is the mass of the earth and G is
the universal gravitational constant.

We can convert Eq. (2) to the ﬂat-earth picture simply by introducing the x, y coordinates of Eq. (1), and can write

the trajectory in the right hand side of Fig. 1 as

y + R =

To simplify the complex appearance of this equation we introduce two dimensionless parameters. The ﬁrst is ǫ
h/R,
a parameter that tells us something about the relative size of the trajectory and the earth. We want our second
parameter to be expressed in terms of quantities appropriate to the usual description of a ballistic trajectory. To that

≡

end we introduce the parameter Vhoriz, the particle velocity at the top of the trajectory, and we combine it with the
acceleration of gravity at the surface of the earth g to form the dimensionles parameter

We next note that Vhoriz = L/(R + h) and g = GM/R2, so that α is equivalent to (L2/GM h)/(1 + ǫ)2. With these
equivalences we can rewrite the trajectory in Eq. (3) as

In Eq. (5), the only length scale that explicitly appears is h, a scale appropriate to the description of ballistic
trajectories. But the parameter ǫ
h/R still carries information about the size of the earth. The familiar parabolic
trajectory follows when this parameter is taken to be very small. To see this, we can expand the right hand side in
powers of ǫ and keep only the term to zero order in ǫ (keeping α ﬁxed). The result is

≡

the standard parabolic ballistic trajectory,

We now look more carefully at the exact orbit in the ﬂat-earth coordinates of Eq. (5).

In Fig. 2 we present
trajectories for ǫ = 10−4, hence for h
0.63 km. The derivation above, of the parabolic approximation, assumes
that α is of order unity. To see interesting deviations from a parabola, we consider large values of α in the ﬁgure.
For α = 15, 000, the deviations from the parabola are striking indeed; the trajectory bends upward. This, of course,
is simply the appearance in our coordinates of an elliptical orbit for which the radius of curvature at the apogee is
greater than the radius of curvature of the earth’s surface. That trajectory is still bound; at greater distances than
those shown in the ﬁgure the trajectory bends downward, and eventually intersects the surface of the earth.

FIG. 2:

What may be most surprising in Fig. 2, is that large deviations from the parabola occur when the range of a
trajectory is only around 90h, or about 60 km, a tiny distance compared to the size of the earth. To see why this is

where we have used the fact that the range is approximately 2h√2α. Equation (8) shows that the deviation from the
standard range formula is large when the range is of order √Rh or R√ǫ, and hence can be important for orbits that
are much smaller than the scale of the earth8. This conclusion is in good agreement with the α = 3000, ǫ = 10−4
example in Fig. 2. For these parameters the parabolic approximation misses the target by 15%.

There is a nice way of understanding what we have just found. The replacement of the spherical earth surface with
a ﬂat surface, in Fig. 1, is justiﬁable only if the trajectory is more sharply curved than is the earth surface. That is, if
the minimal radius of curvature along the trajectory is smaller than the radius of the earth. The radius of curvature9

where we have used Eq. (6). The condition that the maximum curvature of the trajectory (the curvature at x = 0) is
1 for which we
much greater than the curvature of the earth’s surface is that hα/R
have, from Eq. (8), a large deviation from the parabolic range prediction. We can now understand this in terms of
radius of curvature of the trajectory. For a small h, high velocity orbit, a projectile can move “just above” the surface
of the earth on a trajectory with a range much larger than its height h (but much smaller than R). The curvature
of that trajectory in space is mostly due to the curvature of the earth. In the ﬂat earth picture the true trajectory
would seem to have almost constant height, and would greatly deviate from a parabola11.

There is also an interesting non-geometrical way of viewing the condition αǫ

αǫ =

where Vcirc is the velocity of a circular orbit with radius R (i.e. , just above the earth surface), and Vesc is the escape
velocity from the earth surface. This condition, then, is simply the condition that the motion is very slow compared
to typical “orbital” (as opposed to “trajectory”) motions.

III.

IS GRAVITY VERTICAL IN THE FLAT-EARTH PICTURE?

In Section I we argued that gravitational acceleration must be vertical in the ﬂat earth picture. It is apparent
in Fig. 2 that this cannot be correct. For the α = 15, 000 trajectory, the particle is accelerating upward. And this
particle is at a height of only a kilometer or so above the earth’s surface, where the acceleration of gravity is certainly
close to 9.8 m/sec2 and is even more certainly downward.

Another clear indication that “vertical acceleration” is not the whole story, is the fact that the horizontal velocity
dx/dt changes in time. Figure 3 shows the small, but nonzero, fractional change in the horizontal velocity along the
orbit. To understand the results in this ﬁgure we note that

it is proportional to L/r2. The
In this simple calculation it is easy to see why the horizontal velocity changes:
angular momentum L is constant, but r is not constant except in the case of the circular orbit for which α = αcrit ≡
R2/h(R + h). As the particle moves to smaller radius (in the case α < αcrit) the horizontal velocity must increase; as
the particle moves to larger radius (in the case α > αcrit) the particle velocity must decrease. In this mathematics it
is easy to see why the horizontal velocity changes during the motion.

horizontal velocity at the apogee.) Curves are labeled by α. The value α = 9, 999 represents a circular orbit.

At a deeper level, the failure of naive intuition is due to the tacit expectation that the equations of motion for a

unit mass particle can be put in a form

where Fx and Fy are only functions of position x, y. Since particles released from rest will fall vertically downward
we conclude that Fx = 0, and gravity is vertical.

We are misled to this conclusion by the Cartesian appearance of the x, y coordinates on the right side of Fig. 1.

The actual equations of motion12, turn out to be

In the case of a vertical trajectory (dx/dt = 0) the equations are in complete agreement with our expectations. When
= 0, however, the velocity dependent terms, absent in Eqs. (12), are responsible for the failure of intuiton13,14.
dx/dt
These velocity dependent terms are due to the fact that the x, y coordinate lines are actually curved lines through
physical space. We can draw them as straight lines, but the way in which we draw them, or the symbols we use to
represent them, do not change the fact that they are curved in physical space. This curvature of spatial coordinates
comes with its usual kinematical consequences. The (dx/dt)2 in Eq. (14), for example, is just the usual centripetal
term disguised by unusual coordinate names.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

It is plausible to expect that the uniform-gravity, ﬂat-earth gravity parabola is an accurate approximation if the
height h of the trajectory, and the range of the trajectory, are both much less than the earth radius R. In terms of
our parameterization these conditions are, respectively ǫ
1. If we are to have the kinematics correct,
≪
as well as the shape of the orbit, then clearly the ﬁrst condition is necessary; if h is not small compared to R gravity
cannot be of uniform strength.

The second condition, however, is not suﬃciently strict. The correct second condition for the validity of the ﬂat-
earth approximation is that the maximum curvature of the trajectory be much greater than the curvature of the

6
earth’s surface. In our notation this corresponds to orbits that satisfy αǫ

of Book I, Section II. Newton does not give much details about how the limit should be taken. While taking the center of
the ellipse to inﬁnity and letting the eccentricity approach unity (from below), the latus rectum is to be kept ﬁxed. Notice
that the center of the earth, at the distant focus, is also taken to inﬁnity. For more details on a closely related way to take

6 Our choice is not the only reasonable way of carrying out this mapping. We could alternatively have chosen x = rφ, for
example. By comparison, our choice suﬀers from having unequal physical distances, for equal increments of x, along x
coordinate lines. Our choice, however, gives much simpler dynamical equations at the end of this article. The choice made
has no distinguishable eﬀect on the appearance of the results given in the ﬁgures.

8 This sort of high velocity motion is not typical of practical ballistic trajectories, in which projectiles are launched at an
angle near 45o. For such trajectories α is of order unity, and the parabolic approximation is accurate. For a given range and
a given ǫ, a larger value of α means a larger value of Vhoriz, or equivalently of the required muzzle velocity. Though the
conclusion from Eq. (8) is meant to be a point of principle, not of practical importance, it is interesting that large guns exist
that are able to achieve muzzle velocities of several km/sec necessary to have peak height h and range, of the same order as
the values h ∼ 1 km and range ∼ 100 km in our example.

9 The radius of curvature at a point in a plane curve is deﬁned as the radius of the “osculating circle,” or the circle of curvature,
the circle whose ﬁrst and second derivative agree with those of the curve at that point. This curvature is equivalent to the
magnitude of the derivative, with respect to arc length, of the unit tangent to the curve. See, e.g., M. P. do Carmo,
Diﬀerential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces (Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 1976).

10 The radius of curvature of the ellipse at its apogee is

R = hα

(1 + ǫ)2
1 − αǫ(1 + ǫ)

.

For αǫ ≪ 1 (which is equivalent to R/R ≪ 1), and for ǫ ≪ 1, this coincides with Eq. (9) at the apogee.

11 The condition that the parabolic trajectory is a good approximation for the true orbit, i.e., that R/R ≪ 1, is equivalent to

L/R ≪ 1, L being the semilatus rectum.

12 These equations can be derived by substituting r = y + R and φ = x/(R + h) in the standard equations for central force
motion. A rather simpler equivalent set of equations follows, of course, by writing the two constants of motion, energy and
angular momentum, in terms of x, y coordinates. The form in Eq. (14), with second derivatives with respect to time, is given
to emphasize the velocity dependence of the acceleration.

13 One could claim that we have not shown that “gravity” fails to be vertical. The velocity-dependent terms in Eqs. (14),
after all, do not contain the gravitational constant G. Those terms are actually kinematic terms due to the nature of the
coordinates. To avoid this criticism, the fallacious argument at the end of Sec. I was made for “a particle being acted upon
only by gravitational forces.”

14 Notice that the velocity dependent term on the right hand side of Eq. (14) is made negligible with respect to the term not
−1/2, but one cannot neglect the velocity dependent right hand side of

depending on the velocity if ( dx/ dt)/Vhoriz ≪ (αǫ)

−1/2 and the right hand side of Eq. (13) is rather
Eq. (13). Notice, however, that typically indeed ( dx/ dt)/Vhoriz ≪ (αǫ)
small, such that Galileo’s picture of separate horizontal and vertical motions is a fair description of the motion. However,
for the values of the parameters we considered above, αǫ is about unity, such that it is easy to see that the equations of
motion (13) and (14) are indeed coupled, and “gravity is not vertical.”

In previous work ( physics/0004026) was shown, with the help of numer-
ical calculations, that the eﬀective Brown temperature for charged particle is
lower than that for particle without charge. Here we derive this result with-
out numerical calculations, integrating the delay equation analytically, as for
zero, so for nonzero viscosity.

1.

To describe motion of charged Brown particle in so called ”extended
quasi-stationary approximation”[1] in [2] was used the Sommerfeld model [3]
of charged rigid sphere. The equation of straightline motion of such Brown
particle in dimensionless form reads [2]:

˙y(x) = f (x) + γ · [y(x − δ) − y(x)]

(1)

here

y(x) - is dimensionless velocity of the particle;
x - is dimensionless ”time”;
f (x) - is some external (stochastic) force;
δ - is ”time” delay;
γ - is coeﬃcient: γ · δ is proportional to the ratio of particle’s electromag-
netic mass to the mechanical mass: γ · δ = (2/3)(Q2/a)/(mc2) ( 2a - is the
size of Sommerfeld particle of charge Q and mass m);
the viscosity Γ of the surrounding medium is zero.
In [2] was shown, with the help of numerical calculations, that the eﬀective
Brown temperature for charged particle is lower than that for particle without
charge. Here we derive this result without numerical calculations, integrating
the delay equation (1) analytically.

With zero initial conditions:
y = ˙y = 0 for x < 0
dividing the x-axis into δ - intervals (i − 1)δ ≤ x ≤ iδ, i = 1, ...,
and integrating eq. (1) step by step with boundary conditions yi(x =

iδ) = yi+1(x = iδ), we ﬁnally get the recurrence formula:

for (N − 1)δ ≤ x ≤ Nδ

dzf (z) exp γ(z − x) + γ

dz yN −1(z) exp γ(z + δ − x)

Let’s consider one interesting case:
f (x) for intervals (i − 1)δ ≤ x ≤ iδ is constant and is equal to fi.
Then the eq.(2) for x = Nδ ≡ xN yields

This result resembles the classical Brown result: from eq.(4) with γ = 0 one

dividing x-interval of integration in (7) into δ- intervals with f (x) = fk for
(k − 1)δ ≤ x ≤ kδ, one can take the integral in (7) in the following manner:

y(x = xN ) = δ

N

Xk=1

This result diﬀers from (6) only in the multiplier

1
(1+p) .

Thus one can say that the eﬀect of delay (eﬀect of retardation) for eq.(1)
reduces to the eﬀect of mass renormalization: m → m/(1+p), or consequently
to the eﬀect of reduction of the external force:

f → f /(1 + p)

This result also says that the reduction of the external force is model-independent
one, and instead of γδ one can write the classical ratio of self-electromagnetic
mass to the mechanical mass m in its general form:

γδ →

mc2 Z

d~rd~r′ ρ(~r)ρ(~r′)
|~r − ~r′|

here ρ - is distribution of charge of a particle.

If fk, k = 1, ... - is the range of stochastic numbers with average value fa:
< fk >= fa (here brackets <> denote time average with the same deﬁnition
as in the classical theory of Brownian motion), then eq.(3) yields

N >= fa

Dk ≈ faxN /(1 + p)

This result should be compared with classical one.

The theory of Brownian motion without viscosity tells ( eq.

(1) with

γ = 0 ) that the dispersion DB is

dz2 · R(z1 − z2)

(15)

here R(z1 − z2) =< (f (z1) − fa)(f (z2) − fa) > - is the correlation function.
If

R(z1 − z2) = R0δ(z1 − z2)

then

DB = R0x

(16)

Consequently we see that (eqs. (16) and (14) ) the dispersion of the Som-
merfeld charged particle is lower than that of the classical Brown particle
without electric charge: D = DB(1 + p)−2. Thus one can say that the ef-
fective temperature of Sommerfeld particle is lower than that of the Brown
one. This result is model independent one (see the remark made above - eq.
(10) ).

So we conﬁrm the result of the work [2].

If the viscosity Γ is not zero, the main equation reads:

˙y(x) + Γ · y(x) = f (x) + γ · [y(x − δ) − y(x)]

Iterative solution y(xN ) = y∗

here Dk - some discrete function which can be found from recurrence for-
mula, analogous to (2). But it is convenient to ﬁnd Dk from the following
considerations, using exact results (18,19). Solution (20) must tend to the
exact solution (18) (in the case fi = f0 = const ∀ i) if the x-axis is divided
into inﬁnitesimally small δ-intervals: δ → 0 and N → ∞ in such a way that
xN = δ · N = const. Thus one can rewrite

so

Dk =

(1 − exp (−aδN))

(21)

If δ → 0 we can replace the sum in lhs of (21) by the integral:

Dkdk =

(1 − exp (−aδN))

(22)

Diﬀerentiation of (22) with respect to N provides us with this expression for

Consequently the required result (rhs of (21) ) is reproduced if we expand
the denominator in (24) in the following way:

Using this representation of Dk, one can ﬁnd the dispersion D. For cor-

relation function (13) we have

2(Γ)2 (1 − exp (−2aδN))

(25)

here we expanded the expression exp (2aδ) −1 in the same manner as in (24):
exp (2aδ) − 1 ≈ 2aδ.

Solving the eq.(19) in approximation (24), we ﬁnd

So with (26) and (25) the dispersion D takes the form

D =

R0
2(Γ)(1 + γδ)

(1 − exp (−2aδN))

(27)

Dispersion (27) for γ ≡ 0 is exactly the same as Brownian dispersion DB:

DB =

i.e. the solution we have got earlier (14).

If axN ≫ 1, (27) yields

D ≈

R0
2Γ(1 + γδ)

=

DB
(1 + γδ)

Thus dispersion D diﬀers from the Brownian one. Consequently the eﬀec-
tive temperature of charged particle, undergoing Brownian motion, is lower
then that of particle without charge. Now we have proved this result in
general case of nonzero viscosity. Of course, our general conclusion is model-
independent one - see the above remark (10).

How do clarinet players adjust the
resonances of their vocal tracts for diﬀerent
playing eﬀects?

Abstract

In a simple model, the reed of the clarinet is mechanically loaded by the series
combination of the acoustical impedances of the instrument itself and of the player’s
vocal tract. Here we measure the complex impedance spectrum of players’
tracts
using an impedance head adapted to ﬁt inside a clarinet mouthpiece. A direct current
shunt with high acoustical resistance allows players to blow normally, so the players
can simulate the tract condition under playing conditions. The reproducibility of
the results suggest that the players’ ”muscle memory” is reliable for this task. Most
players use a single, highly stable vocal tract conﬁguration over most of the playing
range, except for the altissimo register. However, this ’normal’ conﬁguration varies
substantially among musicians. All musicians change the conﬁguration, often drasti-
cally for ”special eﬀects” such as glissandi and slurs: the tongue is lowered and the
impedance magnitude reduced when the player intends to lower the pitch or to slur
downwards, and vice versa.

Introduction

Acousticians (Backus[1], Benade [2], Hoekje [6], Johnson et al.[3], Wilson [7]) are
divided over the extent of the inﬂuence of the respiratory tract in playing reed in-
struments, of which the clarinet is the most studied example. The reed interacts with
acoustical waves in the bore of the instrument and with waves in the player’s tract.
A simple argument shows that the acoustical impedances of these are approximately
in series[2]. The cross section of the clarinet bore is rather smaller than that of the
tract, so its characteristic impedance is higher. Further, the resonances in the in-
strument have a high value of quality factor, so the peaks in impedance have high

value and, to ﬁrst order, usually determine the playing regime of the bore-reed-tract
system [4]. Nevertheless, the eﬀects of the impedance spectrum of the vocal tract,
even if smaller than those of the clarinet, may be important, because musicians are
often interested in subtle eﬀects. For instance, a 1% change in frequency could be a
large mistuning for a musician, and subtle changes in the spectral envelope may be
important in controlling timbre and musical expression. This is the opinion of most
acousticians - even if they do not necessarily agree about how the vocal tract aﬀects
the sound production - except for Backus who considers that the player’s tract has
a negligible inﬂuence on the instrument tone.

Strictly speaking, it is the impedance of the entire airway of the player, from
mouth to lungs, that loads the reed or lips from the upstream side. However, Mukai [5]
reported that experienced players of wind instruments keep the glottis (the aperture
between the vocal folds) almost closed when playing. This is very important to
the possible inﬂuence of the tract: with an open glottis, the airway has relatively
weak resonances, because it is terminated with the high losses in the lungs and lower
airways. In contrast, an almost closed glottis provides a high coeﬃcient of reﬂection
for acoustic waves at all but the lowest frequencies, and so would be expected to give
strong resonances, similar to those that give rise to formants in speech. For that
reason, we shall refer hereafter to the player’s vocal tract as the resonator that is
controlled by the player.

Impedance measurements have been made previously (Benade [2], Backus [1],
Hoekje [6] and Wilson [7]) but are not fully exploitable or applicable due to the
fact that they either were performed under conditions that do not closely resemble
those used to play an instrument, or that they lacked phase information, or contained
high levels of background noise. Moreover, they were made in most cases on only
one subject. The measurement conditions should reproduce, as much as possible, the
playing condition, so that the player can automatically adopt the tract conﬁgura-
tions used in playing under particular conditions. For example, Benade [2] measured
the impedance of a clarinettist’s tract by inserting into the player’s mouth a pipe
containing the acoustical source and the microphone. The pipe inner diameter was
20 mm, which forces the player to open the mouth considerably more than he would
when playing a clarinet. This problem was solved by Hoekje [6], who used a similar
arrangment, with the exception that he reduced the size of the part which goes into
the musician’s mouth. But he measured low values of the impedance (maxima about
8 MPa.s.m−3), therefore much smaller than the maxima measured for the clarinet
using most ﬁngerings (Wolfe et al [8]). This may be explained by the fact the player
could not breathe into the apparatus, nor was the glottis aperture monitored. It is
likely, therefore, that the subject may have relaxed the glottis, and thus reduced the
magnitude of the airway resonances, as discussed above. This is the case too with
Backus [1]’s measurements which only give a maximum magnitude of 5 MPa.s.m−3.
That explains certainly as well why he reported that the values he obtained could not
be consistently reproduced, as a muscian cannot be consistent with his glottis if he
cannot blow. Moreover, all these studies only give the amplitude of the impedance
but not the phase. Wilson [7] measured the complex impedance in a situation in
which a clarinettist could mime playing, but again the absence of a DC ﬂow and the

2

general low magnitude of Z suggests that the glottis may have been relaxed. Fur-
ther, these measurements are quite noisy as they were made with only one chirp, of
duration 1/3 second. The performers were three professional clarinettists and two
advanced amateurs.

It has not yet proved possible to make impedance measurements in the vocal
tract during playing because of the very high sound levels produced by the reed.
(The acoustic current produced in the tract by the reed is comparable with that
produced in the clarinet, so peak pressure levels are high.) Consequently, it is still
necessary to measure clarinettists miming playing.
In the measurements reported
here, a direct current shunt was placed in parallel with the impedance head, to allow
the players to blow normally, and so to adopt a tract conﬁguration approaching that
used for playing.

Measurements were done on professional clarinettists and advanced students.
They were asked to play notes on their own clarinet, set up for normal playing,
and then to mime playing on the instrument containing the impedance head. Notes
over the range of the instrument were chosen, and players were asked to play and to
mime a range of conditions requiring diﬀerent embouchures to adjust the intonation
or register, or to produce other eﬀects.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 The impedance spectrometer

The setup is based on the impedance spectrometer developed previously [9], which
uses a source of acoustic current produced from an output with high acoustic impedance
(see FIG. 1) and which is calibrated using an acoustically inﬁnite waveguide as the
reference impedance. This reference is a straight, cylindrical stainless steel pipe, 7.8
mm in diameter and 42 m long, so that echos, in the frequency range of interest,
return attenuated by about 80 dB or more. Several compromises were made to in-
corporate an impedance head of this type into the clarinet mouthpiece so that it can
measure the impedance that loads the clarinet reed but does not disturb the player.
A range of impedance heads and (cylindrical) reference waveguides are available.
For this experiment, we chose one to use a diameter (7.8 mm), because it yields
a cross sectional area comparable with that of the eﬀective surface area of the reed
protruding past the lower lip inside the mouth. Such an impedance head was mounted
inside a modiﬁed clarinet mouthpiece as is shown in Fig 2. The angle is chosen so
that the head passes through the upper surface of the mouthpiece just beyond the
point where the player’s teeth rest and meets the lower surface at the position of
the reed tip. The end of the attenuator (the current source) and a small microphone
(Countryman CAI-B6 miniature B6, diameter 2 mm) positioned l = 9 mm from the
end of the head, and the impedance at the end is calculated using the transfer matrix
for a cylindrical waveguide.

This angle produces an eliptical area at the end of the measurement head. For
calibration, this was simply sealed on the circular area of the reference waveguide,
with the centres aligned. Several other geometries were also tried: one used a bent
waveguide between the measurement plane and the reference plane. Another used

3

straight tubes as here, but the extra volume at the ends of the elipse were ﬁlled with
modelling compound. To estimate the eﬀect of the discontinuities thus produced, the
impedance was measured for a range of waveguides with simple, known geometries
(cylindrical pipes of diﬀerent diameters and lengths), for which the impedance is
known from other measurements to agree well with theory. The most successful ﬁts
were obtained from the geometry shown: the simple straight impedance head with the
open eliptical end. For pipes of same diameter as the head, the comparison between
the measurement gives an error of 1% in frequency and up to 20% in amplitude ar
high frequency.

The mouthpiece was sealed with epoxy so that the measurement head is connected
only to the player’s tract and not to the clarinet. In any case, the position of the
head, which should measure the impedance in the plane of the reed near its tip,
prohibits the installation of a reed. Preliminary experiments showed however that
musicians could reproduce embouchures that had very similar acoustic impedance
spectra. This suggested that they have a high developed sensory or muscle memory
and can mime easily a conﬁguration that they use regularly. This is not surprising:
it is presumably what they must do normally before playing in order to have the
desired pitch and timbre from the beginning of their ﬁrst note. However, players are
not usually aware of the position of the vocal folds and the glottis and so, if they are
not blowing air, they may close them or relax them. For that reason, a shunt with
a DC impedance, judged by a clarinettist to be comparable with that of a clarinet
under normal playing conditions, was introduced to allow subjects to blow normally.
A small pipe (40 mm long and 3 mm diameter) was positioned to provide a shunt
or leak from the mouth to the outside air. Its short length ensured that resonances
and antiresonances fell beyond the frequency range of interest and measurement, its
diameter ensures that its characteristic impedance is between 10 and 100 times larger
than the maxima in the vocal tract impedance with which it is in parallel, and it
was ﬁlled with acoustic wool which makes the impedance largely resistive, reduces
the turbulent noise due to ﬂow and provides a DC resistance comparable to that of
a real clarinet.

To prevent water condensation in the measurement apparatus, a low voltage elec-

trical circuit was used to raise the temperature of the impedance head to 40°C.

2.2 Procedure

Seventeen players took part in the experiment and their musical level varied between
advanced student and professional. They ﬁrst answered a survey about their musical
background and their opinion about the inﬂuence of the vocal tract when playing.
Throughout all measurement sessions, a digital audio tape recorder was used to record
players comments and played sounds. The microphone was positioned 10 cm from
the bell.

For measurements, each player was asked ﬁrst to play a note mezzo forte on
his/her own clarinet, and then to mime playing the same note on the modiﬁed clar-
inet. The notes, selected after discussion with clarinettists, were (written) G3, G4,
G5 and G6. G3 is close to the lower end of the instrument range and uses almost the
full length of the nearly cylindrical part of the bore. It is a good example of a note

4

in the chalumeau register. G4 use the fundamental mode of a relatively short section
of the bore: it is an example of a note in the throat register. G5 uses the speaker
or primary register key and the second resonance of a medium length tube: it is an
example of the clarino register. G6 uses two open register holes and is an example of
a note in the altissimo register.

The subjects then played and mimed some unusual embouchures: some peculiar
conﬁgurations such as pitch bending (lowering the pitch without changing the ﬁn-
gering), slurring a register change and embouchures of their own suggestion used for
diﬀerent playing conditions. They were also asked to mime embouchures described
in terms of vowels (in particular “ee” and “aw”), a description used by some clar-
inettists. For the slurred register change, the musicians were asked to mime over 5
seconds what they usually do less than a second, during the transient between two
notes.

The measurements were made over the range 0.1-3 kHz, which includes the playing
range of the instrument. In this range, there are usually three vocal tract resonances,
at typically 0.3, 1.3 and 2.3 kHz, although the frequency varies among diﬀerent
players and playing conditions. The sampling in the frequency domain was chosen
as a compromise between a high signal to noise ratio and precision in frequency. The
frequency resolution was set at 5.4 Hz. The measurement time was set at 10 seconds
(except for some unusual embouchures) as it is tiring and hard for a musician to hold
a constant embouchure longer.

3 Results

3.1 The survey

Except from one amateur player, all the participating musicians consider that their
vocal tract has a very important inﬂuence on the timbre. Regarding the pitch, four
of them think that the vocal tract is important whereas the seventeen others regard
it as very important.

For more speciﬁc details, we shall only quote here the musicians who were the
most able to describe their own utilisation of the vocal tract. We shall retain their
own vocabulary, which often corresponds to mental and musical images. Some of
the subjects, with busy schedules as performing musicians, had done no teaching for
many years and were therefore not in the habit of describing what they do with the
mouth.

One subject, a very experienced music teacher, reported having reﬂected at depth
on what she does in order to explain it to her pupils. Se changes the vocal tract shape
for:

ˆ note bending (ie adjusting the pitch using the mouth, rather than keys on the

instrument);

ˆ changing tonal colours to give character to interpretations. For that eﬀect, she
especially uses two conﬁgurations. In one, which she names for the vowel in
“hee”, she reports that she has the back and middle tongue in a high position,
increased lip tension, the soft palate is lowered and the throat somewhat closed.

5

This embouchure she uses and recommends for for brightening the sound. In
another named for the vowel in “haw”, she reports a high soft palate, the back
of the tongue lowered and the throat more open. This she recommends and
uses for darkening the timbre

ˆ for changing articulation : the tongue has to be as close as possible to the tip
of the reed to have a light articulation. So the “hee” conﬁguration is usually
more appropriate than the “haw” one.

Her tongue touches the lower lip but not usually the lower teeth. The tongue can
actually touch the lip/teeth in low or clarion register but not in altissimo register. It
is in general between 1 and 2 mm away from the teeth.

Another experienced player and teacher reported lifting the soft palate in order
to obtain more resonance and projection which, she said, induces a richer sound. She
reports that her tongue touches neither the lower teeth nor the lower lip, and is in
diﬀerent positions according to the register:

ˆ for the low register, the tongue is low and arched, 1 cm away from the lip

ˆ for the high register: the tongue is higher in the mouth, moves a little forward

(about 8 mm away from the lip), becomes wider and ﬂattens.

One advanced student prefers having the tongue high in the mouth so the sound is
more “focused”. He uses changes in the vocal tract for register change, large intervals,
pitch bend and multiphonics.

One very experienced professional player reported that he enriches the sound in
high harmonics by opening the oral cavity. Further, he opens the throat when he
descends a register. Above all, however, he reports using his facial muscles in order
to modify the embouchure.

Another very experienced profesional player imagines, when playing, “focussing
the sound through the nose”. She has the impression that the more her soft palate
is arched the more the sound is “focussed”. (It should be remarked that the velum
must be closed or very nearly closed during clarinet playing, to avoid a DC shunt
through the nose that would prohibit playing. However, the muscular tension in the
velum could in principle aﬀect the impedance spectrum.)

In at least one case, disagreements among the opinions of the musicians were
reported. One reported that large mouth cavity was useful for a ”rich, focussed”
sound, while others reported that they achieved such a sound by lifting the tongue
close to the soft palate. One explanation is that the musicians in question have
diﬀerent meanings for ”rich” and especially for ”focussed” in this circumstance.

3.2 Reproducibility of the impedance measurements

Reproducibility was tested on each musician by making about ﬁve measurements of
the embouchure for the same note (written G3) over the course of a session (typically
40 minutes). Players were able to repeat their embouchures rather reproducibly: in
the typical result shown in FIG. 3, the second resonance is obtained at 1250 Hz with
a standard deviation of 3 % in frequency and 15 % in amplitude.

3.3 General comments

Most of the subjects in our study reported that, for normal playing, they use an
embouchure that varies little over most of the range, except for the highest register.
This was conﬁrmed by the measurements: for all players, the form of the impedance
spectra is quite stable on the whole register, except sometimes from the altissimo
register.

The average amplitude of the impedance is similar for all musicians. The ﬁrst
peak, whose frequency is between 200 and 300 Hz, has an amplitude between 1.8
and 5.6 MPa.s.m−3 . The next resonances are on the other hand diﬀerent for both
amplitude and frequency. For some player embouchure combinations, the amplitudes
are in the range 30 to 100 MPa.s.m−3 which is of the same order of the clarinet
resonances [8].

The diﬀerence between the impedance spectra recorded for the “normal” playing
conﬁguration and that measured for the tract conﬁguration used for “special eﬀects”
is not very large for any of the student players measured. For some of the professional
players, however, the eﬀect was very large. However, the spectra measured for the
diﬀerent special eﬀects also varied substantially among these players, just as it did
for normal playing.

For several players, the ”ee” conﬁguration produced a strong peak between 560
and 1000 Hz, a peak that is associated with the constriction between tongue and
palate (eg Fig 7). For many players, however, the conﬁguration they produced when
asked to mime the ”ee” embouchure, had no such peak and indeed resembled some-
what the impedance measured when they were asked to mime the ”aw” embouchure.
However, the average level of impedance, even for these players, was in general higher
for “ee” than for “aw”. Not all players use the ”ee” and ”aw” terminology for the
embouchure and it is possible that the instruction was in this case confusing.
It
is important to remark that this terminology in terms of vowels refers more to the
position of the tongue in the mouth than to the real conﬁguration of the vocal tract
in speech as the mouth of the player is of course closed around the mouthpiece.

3.4 Diﬀerences among players for “normal” playing mode

We study here the conﬁgurations that musicians use in “normal” playing, which
means the conﬁguration they adopt usually, when they have no special musical in-
tentions, in the mezzo forte nuance. For comparisons, we choose the note G4 which is
representative of the low and medium register and the note G6 for the high register.
In FIG. 4, the same two musicians mime playing each of the notes.

The conﬁguration for the note G4 is qualitatively similar for both musicians. A
few exceptions apart, it is a conﬁguration used by many players in the normal playing
mode for almost the whole range of the clarinet, as the ﬁgures available on [10] show
it. However, the conﬁguration adopted for the very high register can diﬀer quite
considerably among players: some musicians adopt a conﬁguration that enhances
the second peak and to move it into the frequency range of the note played whereas
some others tend to adopt a conﬁguration that reduces the amplitude of this peak.

7

3.5 Variations used by players

Players agree that they use diﬀerent embouchures for diﬀerent eﬀects. The em-
bouchure includes the lip and jaw position, and hence the force, the damping and the
position on the reed may vary. The aspect being studied here is the way in which the
mouth or vocal tract geometry changes can aﬀect the impedance spectrum. The sub-
stantial changes shown in FIG. 5 suggest that this latter eﬀect may not be negligible.
even if the conﬁguration in normal mode is quite stable on the whole register.

It is interesting to note the remarkable similarity in the impedances for “special
eﬀects” between two professional players who played together for several years in
a major national orchestra, whereas they do not adopt the same conﬁguration for
normal playing (ﬁgure 6).

One of the professional players expressed how she uses her vocal tract in terms
In particular, she uses a “ee” conﬁguration for the high register or for
of vowels.
brightening the sound and in contrarily she adopts a “aw” conﬁguration for darkening
the timbre and lowering the pitch. The diﬀerences between these two conﬁgurations
are represented in FIG. 7.

3.6 Subtlety

In most cases, two diﬀerent eﬀects on the sound were correlated with two diﬀerent
impedances. However, for some of the players, the impedances measured when they
were miming ”good” and ”bad” embouchures diﬀered by amounts comparable with
the measured reproducibility of a single embouchure. For example, FIG. 8 shows a
large similarity between the impedances for embouchures described by a very expe-
rienced soloist as those corresponding to a ”nice” and a ”bad” sound. We presume
that in this case the diﬀerences had more to do with aspects of the embouchure such
as lip tension and position, and less to do with the tract conﬁguration.

4 Conclusion

The newly conﬁgured spectrometer permitted the measurement of the impedance
spetra of the vocal tracts of clarinet players in a situation that allowed them to
mime the conditions of playing. In contrast with previous measurements, the players
could blow into the mouthpiece and, probably as a consequence of this, the impedance
spectra showed the strong resonances that are characteristic of a nearly closed glottis,
which is the case both for speech and for the playing of experience wind instrument
players [5].

The peak values of impedance measured were in some cases comparable with
the peak values of that of the clarinet (Wolfe et al [8]). Moreover, the vocal tract
impedance is much larger than the clarinet impedance around the even harmonics.
The phase of these harmonics, when we consider the whole impedance (i.e. the sum of
the clarinet impedance and the vocal tract one) is thus shifted, which may aﬀect the
playing frequency. This suggests that the acoustic eﬀects of the vocal tract should
not be neglected and that they may have a musically signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
sound produced.

8

The combination of these measurement with a survey about the utilisation by
clarinet players of their vocal tract allow us to relate observed acoustical responses
to the reported embouchures of the players. All players agreed that the vocal tract
had a large inﬂuence on the sound, but their opinions regarding the best conﬁguration
to adopt diﬀer considerably. Nevertheless, two general trends can be observed. The
players try to keep their conﬁguration stable for most part of the register, which is
in contrast to Johnson [3]’s suggestion that players may tune the main vocal tract
resonance to the note played. On the other hand, the conﬁguration can be changed
substantially for special eﬀects such as diﬃcult slurs across registers or pitch bend:
players lower the tongue and the overall magnitude of the impedance when they
aim to bend the pitch down, or to slur downwards over registers, and vice versa.
To examine this phenomenon in more detail, we hope that, in the future, it may
be possible to make such measurements in real time in order to determine how the
musican changes his conﬁguration during a transition.

Abstract

A speciﬁc model of the inertial law is presented by which we can
have some deeper insight into the essence of mass and inertia. In this
modiﬁed theory there is no need to keep the concept of absolute space
and the third law as a principle. By introducing a convenient form
for gravitational law the coupling constant G becomes a function of
inertial parameters of the universe.

Keywords:Absolute Space,Classical Theories of Gravity,Cosmology,Inertia.

According to the Newton’s second law of motion the relation ~F = m~a
holds between the applied force on a particle and its acceleration in absolute
space and any other frames which are related to it by Galilean transforma-
tions. These reference frames are called inertal frames and m is the inertial
mass of the particle. The relation between coordinates of two inertial sys-
tems S and S ′ which are moving with constant velocity ~v with respect to
each other are :

t′ = t
~a′ = ~a
~u′ = ~u − ~v
~x′ = ~x − ~vt + ~x0

turn the basis of mass and energy is not well deﬁned and has been criticized.
Cogent arguments against absolute space are [1]:

a - There is no unique way of locating Newton’s absolute space within

the ﬁnite class of inertial frames.

b - It conﬂicts with one’s understanding to conceive of a thing which acts

but cannot be acted upon.

In his critique of Newton’s conceptions in “The Science of Mechanics”,
Mach suggested a set of pioneering implicit ideas then addressed by A. Ein-
stein as Mach’s Principle (MP) [2]. According to MP, every motion is only
comprehensive as a relative motion, inertia is due to an interaction with av-
erage mass of the universe [3] and the distribution of matter in the universe
determines the inertial frame at each point. There have been many attempts
to ﬁnd Machianized reformulations of mechanics[4, 5, 6]. Einstein’s main
aim in the general theory of relativity (GR) was to do this through giving an
equation for gravitation and inertia together. But it came out that his theory
shows some non-Machian aspects and do not fulﬁll the MP. For instance it
has solution for empty space. Also there are many alternative theories of
gravitation motivated by Mach’s ideas [7, 8, 9]. Since in GR as our stan-
dard theory of gravitation we are still faced with unresolved questions such
as singularity problems and lack of well deﬁned source for inertia, then it is
reasonable to have more discussions about foundations. It seems with closer
scrutiny of Newton’s second law we may ﬁnd some insight.

Actually in this work our aim is to present a simple method for Machian-
ization of NM. We propose that inertial eﬀect is a mutual interaction between
two particles which in any non-rotating arbitrary reference frame S is propor-
tional to the diﬀerence between their accelerations and to the inertial charges
of each individual particles as follows

~Finertia = µ.c1.c2(~a1 − ~a2)

(2)

where ~a1 , ~a2 are accelerations of particles 1 and 2 with respect to S , their
inertial charges are denoted by c1 , c2 respectively , and µ is an inertial
coupling constant. This can be easily extended to systems consisting of N
particles. Again in any non-rotating arbitrary reference frame S we have

~Fi = µ.ci

N

Xj=1

cj(~ai − ~aj)

(3)

where ~Fi is the applied force on particle i and the summation is done over
all particles.

In the real world the inertial charge and Newtonian inertial mass of a

particle are related so that

mi = µ.ci

cj

all

Xj=1

(4)

where summation is done over all particles in the universe. Since local inho-
mogenities have no observed eﬀects on the inertial mass then it is accepted
that the inertial mass is determined by the global structure of the universe
and the relation (4) for the inertial mass is in accordance with this general
belief. This can be accounted as a simple formulation of Mach’s idea about
inertia.
In terms of inertial mass , equation (3) can be rewritten in the
following form

~Fi = mi

~ai −

These new forms of the second law i.e. equations (3) and (5) are invariant
under transformation to a more general group of reference frames S ′ than
Galilean ones which we may call as generalized Galilean transformations.

t′ = t
~a′ = ~a − ~b
~u′ = ~u − ~bt − ~v
~x′ = ~x − 1

~bt2 − ~vt + ~x0

Here ~b , ~v and ~x0 are the constant acceleration ,velocity and position of S ′
with respect to S at t = 0 respectively.

Within the set of reference frames S ′ with diﬀerent values of ~b and ~v there

is a unique subset call it S ′′ moving with acceleration ~b0

with respect to S.
In S ′′ the form of Newton’s second law of inertia is
recovered, ~Fi = m~a′′. Therefore, inertial frames are a unique set of frames
which are moving with acceleration ~b0 with respect to S with ~v and ~x0 be any
arbitrary value. This again may be accounted for as a feasible formulation of
Mach’s idea about inertial frames. Since ~b0 is determined globally then local
inhomogeneities have a negligible eﬀect on it and inertial frames.

It is evident that equations (3) and (5) also satisfy Newton’s third law.

For a two particle system we have

~F1 = − ~F2 = µ.c1.c2(~a1 − ~a2)

and for a system with N particles it makes

~Fi = 0

all

Xj=1

(8)

(9)

So there is no need to introduce Newton’s third law as an extra principle.

We can extend this model to Newton’s law of gravitation. Equivalence
principle here means that the source of inertia and gravitation is the same.
Then if we deﬁne the gravitational force between two particles of inertial
charges c1 and c2 as

| ~FG |=

µ2.c1.c2
| ~r12 |2

(10)

where | ~r12 |=| ~r1 − ~r2 | is the relative separation between particles 1 and 2.
Then we can express gravitational constant G in terms of inertial charges cis

−

(11)

G = 

Xj=1



which may be accounted for as another aspect of Machian implications that
the so-called physical constants of nature (like G) are to be determined with
some global features of the universe. Since the inertial mass and the gravi-

tational constant are ﬁnite quantities, this means that   all
Pj=1

and the universe cannot be inﬁnitely extended.

cj! is ﬁnite too,

The Lagrangean formalism based on this model of inertial law is the same
as the one for NM except that the kinematic energy of system T which is

equal to Pi

This is an invariant scalar. Then total energy of the system i.e. the sum of
kinetic energy T and potential energy V (rij) , a function of relative separation
rij = ~ri − ~rj, is invariant in all non-rotating reference frames.

Remarks

(i) - It may seem that choosing non-rotating frames is some kind of re-
striction which reduces the generality of the chosen frames. This is
however, not the case, since rotating frames with respect to the whole
universe are distinguishable and can be ﬁxed.

(ii) - Our results show that G and m are not constants of nature but may
change anytime the total inertial charge of the universe changes signiﬁ-
cantly. This can happen in the early stage of evolution of the universe,
i.e. in the epochs of pair production.

(iii) - The concept of energy introduced with this theory is independent of

the reference frame.

(iv) - There is no inertial strucure for empty space.

These may show us how some thing should change in a modiﬁed theory

of relativity.

Abstract

We studied the dynamics of surfacea and wake charges induced by a charged particle travers-

ing a dielectric slab. It is shown that after the crossing of the slab ﬁrst boundary, the induced

on the slab surface charge (image charge) is transformed into the wake charge, which overﬂows

to the second boundary when the particle crosses it. It is also shown, that the polarization of

the slab is of an oscillatory nature, and the net induced charge in a slab remains zero at all

stages of the motion.

Introduction

As it passes through a medium, a fast charged particle excites oscillations of the charge density

behind itself [1-3]. These wakeﬁelds and the particle energy losses associated with their excita-

tion have been studied widely for a variety of media [3-8]. Wakeﬁelds have recently reattracted

interest because of the development of new methods for accelerating particles [9-11].

In most studies of wakeﬁelds it has been assumed that the medium is unbounded. The wake-

ﬁelds are excited as the particle enters the medium, or they disappear when the particle leaves

the medium, because of various transient polarization processes which occur near the inter-

face. Among these processes, the excitation of surface oscillations and the associated additional

energy loss have been studied previously [12-20]. In connection with the development of new

particle acceleration methods, numerical calculations have determined the distance from the

sharp plasma boundary at which the amplitude of the wakeﬁeld excited by an ultrarelativistic

particle reaches the same level as in an unbounded medium [21].

Fairly recently, in connection with problems of emission electronics and optoelectronics, the

image charge and the dynamical image potential created by a moving particle has also been

investigated. To describe the process of formation of the image charge, various approaches

(quantum mechanical, the hydrodynamic, etc.) and various models of the medium have been

employed [22-25].

In the present paper we analyze the dynamics of reversal of the sign of the charges induced

at the slab boundary (repolarization of the slab) as the particle crosses the interface. The

process is found to be of a nonmonotonic, oscillatory nature. The case of normal incidence of

a particle through the slab is considered.

The paper outline is as follows. In section 2, general expressions for the density of wake

charge and total wake charge have been found, using Poisson’s equation. In section 3, general

expressions for the density of induced surface charges and total charges have been found, using

expressions for the normal component of the electric ﬁeld in the internal and external space of

the slab [26]. We apply the results obtained in sections 2 and 3 to the case when slab constructed

from a diatomic cubic ionic crystal or polar semiconductor. In section 4, the obtained results

are discussed.

2 The electromagnetic ﬁeld of charged particle traversing a slab

We consider a fast particle of charge q moving with a velocity u along the z-axis normal to the

boundaries of a slab characterized by a local dielectric function ε(ω). The time interval t during

which the particle moves through the medium is 0 < t < a/u, where a is the slab thickness.

Outside this interval the particle moves in a vacuum.

Ginzburg and Tsytovich [26] have given the expressions for the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a

fast charge passing through a slab. We shall brieﬂy repeat the method of obtaining of these

expressions.

Since the problem is homogeneous both in time and directions in each domain z < 0,

0 < z < a, and z > a normal to the charge velocity, it is convenient to represent all ﬁeld

components as Fourier integrals over time and transversal coordinates r = (x, y). Then the

Fourier component of electric ﬁeld is obtained from the Maxwell equations:

where n = u/u, k = (kx, ky), ρ0(k, ω, z) is the Fourier component of the charge density of the

The total solution of (1) for a charge density (2) is a sum of solutions to homogeneous and

inhomogeneous equations. While the ﬁrst equation describes the radiation ﬁeld, the second

equation describes the particle ﬁeld proper in a medium with local dielectric function ε(ω).

Also, equation (1) must be solved for each domain inside and outside the slab, and therefore

the solutions are joined using the boundary conditions (equality of normal induction components

and transverse electric ﬁeld components on the boundary)

and are not explicitly given here. They may be obtained from the matching conditions for the

normal component of the electric induction on the surfaces z = 0 and z = a.

The ﬁrst terms in (6) and (8) describe the Coulomb ﬁeld of the particle. The ﬁrst term in

(7) describes the particle ﬁeld in an unbounded medium characterized by the dielectric function

ε(ω). The ﬁeld is identical with a Cherenkov radiation electric ﬁeld in the frequency range

β2ε(ω) > 1. All other terms are due to existence of boundaries. Particularly, they describe

the transition radiation in the backward (second term in (6)) and forward (second term in (8))

directions [26].

3 The wake charge evaluation

In this section we shall consider the volume charge induced by a moving particle in a slab (the

so-called wake charge). To evaluate the wake charge, Poisson equation is used

ρv = (1/4π)∇E − ρ0

(17)

in which the ρ0 = qδ(r)δ(ξ) is the charge density of a test particle, ξ = z − ut, E is the electric

ﬁeld in the slab which is determined by the inverse Fourier transformation of (7). Since the

divergence of the second term in (7) (of the radiation ﬁeld) is zero, the wake-charge density is

determined only by the ﬁrst term in (7).

Using this term in the relation (18) we obtain

where δ(x) is a Dirac function. Since the dielectric function of the medium has poles only in

the lower ω half-plane [6], no induced charge exists in front (ξ > 0) of the particle. Note that

the relation (19) may be also obtained from the expression for electrostatic potential created

by the particle in unbounded medium described by a dielectric function ε(ω) [6].

Evaluating an integral of expression (19) over the volume we obtain the wake charge, induced

by the particle, moving in the slab:

evaluation of Φ(t).

The surface-induced charge density is related to the discontinuity of the electric ﬁeld z-component.

Let us consider the dynamics of induced charges for the dielectric slab, the dielectric function

functions tend to zero. Thus, the charges being induced on the surfaces of the dielectric slab

are determined only by the ﬁrst terms in the expressions (24) and (25), that is by the electric

ﬁelds which are created by the particle in an unbounded dielectric with the dielectric function

ε(ω) and in the vacuum when the dielectric is absent.

Using the known Sokhotsky-Plemel relations [6] for quantities σi(ω) in (26) we have

The following relations are obtained from expressions (21), (26)-(28)

(28)

Qos(t) = qΦ(t), Qas(t) = −qΦ(τ ).

Thus, expressions (21) and (29) make it possible to obtain the total surface charge as soon as

the zeros of the function ε(ω) are known. One may easily verify that, at any time, the net

induced charge (a sum of Qos, Qas and Qv) in the slab is zero.

The following interpretation for expressions (20), (21) and (29) may be given. When the

particle approaches the slab surface from a vacuum (t < 0) we have Qos = −(q/2)(1 − 1/ε0),

While the particle moves inside the medium (0 < t < a/u), the ﬁrst boundary charge

Qos(t) =

Meanwhile the volume charge is increased:

Qv(t) = −q

1 −

exp (−υjt) [Aj cos (ωjt) + Bj sin (ωjt)] .

(30)

The second boundary charge remains unchanged.

For t > a/u we have

Qas(t) = −

exp (−υjτ ) [Aj cos (ωjτ ) + Bj sin (ωjτ )] ,

(31)

Qv(t) = q

exp (−υjt) [Aj cos (ωjt) + Bj sin (ωjt)] −

(32)

exp (−υjτ ) [Aj cos (ωjτ ) + Bj sin (ωjτ )] .

The charge on the ﬁrst boundary is given in this case by expression (30).

After the particle crosses the second boundary (t > a/u), the charge on the ﬁrst boundary

decreases to its lower limit (q/2)(1 − 1/ε0). On the second boundary the charge value increases

and attains its maximum −(q/2)(1 − 1/ε0) when t ≫ a/u. The wake charge in the volume

becomes equal to zero.

Thus it follows that after the particle crosses the ﬁrst boundary, the surface charge is trans-

formed into the wake charge. The latter is transformed again into the surface charge after the

particle crosses the second boundary.

We apply the results represented by expressions (20), (21) and (29) for the induced charges

in the model of diatomic cubic ionic crystal or polar semiconductor, whose dielectric function

is given by [27]

.

In this expression ε∞ is the optical frequency dielectric function, ωL and ωT are the frequencies of

the longitudinal and transverse-optical vibration modes of inﬁnite wavelength, υ is the damping

rate, which we assume to be small (υ ≪ ωL), and ε0 is the static dielectric function, which enters

the theory through the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation, ω2

that its root ε(ω) = 0 has the following form:

where Ω2 = ω2

determining the net induced charges:

Figure 1 depicts the time dependence of Qos(t), Qas(t), and Qv(t) for the slab of LiF . The

following values of the parameters were taken for numerical calculations: ε∞ = 1.96 and ε0 =

9.01 [27], υ/ωL = 0.2, and Ωa/u = 15. We see that as the particle crosses the boundary, the

surface and wake charges oscillate with a frequency Ω, although the net induced charge remains

(33)

(34)

(35)

equal to zero.

5 Conclusion

Let us brieﬂy discuss the conditions in which the processes taking place at the boundaries of the

slab can be considered independent and the boundary can be interpreted as that of a half-space,

as was done by Gorbunov et al [19].

We see from expressions (20), (21) and (29) that if the condition a < u/υj is met, the charge

−q(1−1/ε0) has no time to transform into the wake charge before the particle reaches the second

boundary. For this reason the transformation of a surface charge into a wake charge and the

transformation of the latter into a surface charge at the second boundary are interrelated. When

the particle crosses the second boundary of the slab, near the boundary it excites electric-ﬁeld

oscillations [3, 20, 26] whose phase is related to that of the oscillations of the electric ﬁeld near

9

the ﬁrst boundary. For the ﬁelds as the boundaries to be completely independent, a must exceed

u/υj. In this case not only the amplitudes but also the phases of oscillations of the electric

ﬁelds at the boundaries are independent.

We would like to end our consideration with the following note. The densities of induced

surface charges (expressions (23)-(25)) and its corresponding surface current densities may be

considered as the sources of transition radiation [27]. As follows from (24) and (25), the densi-

ties of induced surface charges are determined by both electrostatic and electromagnetic ﬁelds

created by the moving particle. The total induced surface charges, determined by (21) and

(29), do not depend on the velocity of light and, therefore, are determined only by electrostatic

ﬁelds. Thus, electromagnetic ﬁelds do not contribute into the total induced surface charge. It

seems that relativistic eﬀects apparently reveal themselves in the case when the thickness of the

medium traversed is limited.

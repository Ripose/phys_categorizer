This article proposes a characterisation of the double-reed in quasi-static regimes. The non-
linear relation between the pressure drop ∆p in the double-reed and the volume ﬂow crossing it q is
measured for slow variations of these variables. The volume ﬂow is determined from the pressure drop
in a diaphragm replacing the instrument’s bore. Measurements are compared to other experimental
results on reed instrument exciters and to physical models, revealing that clarinet, oboe and bassoon
quasi-static behavior relies on similar working principles. Diﬀerences in the experimental results are
interpreted in terms of pressure recovery due to the conical diﬀuser role of the downstream part of
double-reed mouthpieces (the staple).

INTRODUCTION

A. Context

The usual method for studying and simulating the be-
havior of self-sustained instruments is to separate them
in two functional parts that interact through a set of
linked variables: the resonator, typically described by
linear acoustics, and the exciter, a non-linear element in-
dispensable to create and maintain the auto-oscillations
of the instrument [16].

Although this separation may be artiﬁcial because
there may not be a well-deﬁned boundary between the
two systems, it is usually a simpliﬁed view that allows
to describe the basic functioning principles of the instru-
ment.
In reed instruments, for instance, the resonator
is assimilated to an air column inside the bore, and the
exciter to the reed, which acts as a valve.

In the resonator of wind instruments, the relation be-
tween the acoustic variables, pressure (p) and volume
ﬂow (q) can be described by a linear approximation to
the acoustic propagation which has no perceptive conse-
quences in sound simulations [15]. The oscillation arises
from the coupling between the reed and the air column,
which is mathematically established through the vari-
ables p and q.

The exciter is necessarily a nonlinear component, so
that the continuous source of energy supplied by the pres-
sure inside the musician’s mouth can be transformed into

an oscillating one [16] [14]. The characterisation of the
exciter thus requires the knowledge of the relations be-
tween variables p and q at the reed output (the coupling
region).

In principle this relation is non-instantaneous, because
of inertial eﬀects in the reed oscillation and the ﬂuid dy-
namics. A ﬁrst approach to the characterisation of the
exciter is thus to restrict the study to cases where these
delayed dependencies (or, equivalently, time derivatives
in the mathematical description of the exciter) can be
neglected.

The aim of this paper is to measure the relation be-
tween the pressure and volume ﬂow at the double reed
output in a quasi-static case, that is, when the time varia-
tions of p and q can be neglected, and to propose a model
to explain the measured relation.

B. Elementary reed model

In quasi-static conditions, a simple model can be used
to describe the reed behavior [23]. The reed opening area
(S) is controlled by the diﬀerence of pressure on both
sides of the reed: the pressure inside the reed (pr) and the
pressure inside the mouth (pm). In the simplest model,
the relation between pressure and reed opening area is
considered to be linear and related through a stiﬀness
constant (ks):

(∆p)r = pm − pr = kS(S0 − S)

(1)

In this formula, S0 is the reed opening area at rest, when
the pressure is the same on both sides of the reed. In
most instruments (such as clarinets, oboes or bassoons)
the reed is said to be blown-closed (or inward-striking)

Almeida et Al.

[16], because when the mouth pressure (pm) is increased,
the reed opening area decreases.

Equation (4) can then be re-written in terms of these
dimensionless quantities:

The role of the reed is to control and modulate the
volume ﬂow (q) entering the instrument. The Bernoulli
theorem applied between the mouth and the reed duct
determines the velocity of the ﬂow inside the reed (ur)
independently of the reed opening area:

m = pr +

r

In this equation, ρ is the air density. Usually, the ﬂow
velocity um is neglected inside the mouth, because of
volume ﬂow conservation:
inside the mouth the ﬂow is
distributed along a much wider cross-section than inside
the reed duct.

The volume ﬂow (q) is the integrated ﬂow velocity (ur)
over a cross-section of the reed duct. For the sake of
simplicity, the ﬂow velocity is considered to be constant
over the whole opening area, so that q = Sur. Using
equation (2), the ﬂow is given by

q = S

Combining eq. (3) and eq. (1), it is possible to ﬁnd the
relation between the variables that establish the coupling
with the resonator (pr and q):

The relation deﬁned by equation (4) is plotted in ﬁgure

This formula shows that the shape of the non-linear
characteristic curve of the elementary model is indepen-
dent of the reed and blowing parameters, although the
curve is scaled along the pressure p and volume ﬂow q
axis both by the stiﬀness ks and the beating pressure
pM = ksS0.

C. Generalisation to double-reeds

For reed instruments, the quasi-static non-linear char-
acteristic curve has been measured in a clarinet mouth-
piece [8], [10], and the elementary mathematical model
described above can explain remarkably well the obtained
curve almost until the reed beating pressure (pM ).

For double-reed instruments it was not veriﬁed that
the same model can be applied. In fact, there are some
geometrical diﬀerences in the ﬂow path that can con-
siderably change the theoretical relation of equation (7).
Local minima of the reed duct cross-section may cause
the separation of the ﬂow from the walls and an addi-
tional loss of head of the ﬂow [22], and in that case the
characteristics curve would change from single-valued to
multi-valued in a limited pressure range. This kind of
change could have signiﬁcant consequences on the reed
oscillations.

However, the non-linear characteristic relation was
never measured before for double-reeds, justifying the
work that is presented below.

II. PRINCIPLES OF MEASUREMENT AND
PRACTICAL ISSUES

The characteristic curve requires the synchronised
measurement of two quantities: the pressure drop across
the reed (∆p)r and the induced volume ﬂow q.

dimensions similar to an oboe reed, given by equation (4)

A. Volume ﬂow measurements

The static reed beating pressure [9] pM = ksS0 [24]
is an alternative parameter to S0, and can be used as a
magnitude for proposing a dimensionless pressure:

Similarly a magnitude can be found for q, leading to the
deﬁnition of the dimensionless volume ﬂow

One of the main diﬃculties in the measurement of the
reed characteristics lies in the measurement of the vol-
ume ﬂow. There are instruments which can accurately
measure the ﬂow velocity in an isolated point (LDA, hot-
wire probes) or in a region of a plane (PIV), but it can
be diﬃcult to calculate the corresponding ﬂow by inte-
grating the velocity ﬁeld. In fact it is diﬃcult to do a
sampling of a complete cross-section of the reed because
a large number of points would have to be registered.
Supposing that the ﬂow is axisymmetric at the reed out-
put (which is conﬁrmed by experimental results [4]), the

(5)

(6)

measurement along a diameter of the reed would be suf-
ﬁcient, but regions close to the wall are inaccessible.

On the other hand, commercial ﬂow-meters usually
have the disadvantage of requiring a direct reading, which
would have been unpractical for a complete characteristic
measurement (large number of readings in a short time
interval).

An indirect way of measuring the ﬂow was then pre-
ferred to the above mentioned methods.
It consists in
introducing a ﬂow resistance in series with the reed, for
which the pressure can be accurately related to the ﬂow
running through it (see ﬁg. 2).

The diaphragm method, used successfully by S. Ol-
livier [19] to measure the non-linear characteristic of sin-
gle reeds, is based on this principle. The resistance is
simply a perforated metal disk which covers the reed out-
put.

For such a resistance, and assuming laminar, viscous

aphragm (usually the atmospheric pressure, because the
ﬂow opens directly into free air). The volume ﬂow q is
then determined using a single pressure measurement pr.

B. Practical issues and solutions

1.

Issues

The realisation of the characteristic measurement ex-

periments encountered two main problems:

a. Diaphragm reduces the range of (∆p)r for which
the measurement is possible The addition of a resistance
to the air ﬂow circuit of the reed changes the overall non-
linear characteristic of the reed plus diaphragm system
(corresponding to (∆p)s in ﬁg. 2 and to the dashed line

in ﬁg. 3). The solid line plots the ﬂow against (∆p)r,
the pressure drop needed to plot the non-linear charac-
teristics. When the resistance is increased, the maximum
value of the system’s characteristic is displaced towards
higher pressures [22], whereas the static beating pressure
(pM ) value does not change (because when the reed closes
there is no ﬂow and the pressure drop in the diaphragm
((∆p)d) is zero).

FIG. 3: Comparison of the theoretical reed characteristics
(solid line) with the a model of the overall characteristics of
the reed associated to a diaphragm (dashed) — mathematical
models, based on the Bernoulli theorem [22].

Therefore, if the diaphragm is too small (i. e., the
resistance is too high), part of the decreasing region
(B’C) of the system’s characteristics becomes vertical,
or even multivalued, so that there is a quick transition
between two distant ﬂow values, preventing the measure-
ment of this part of the characteristic curve [10] (see ﬁg-
ure 3). A critical diaphragm size (Sd,crit = 0.58S0) can
be found below which the characteristic curve becomes
multi-valued (see appendix A).

b. Reed auto-oscillations Auto-oscillations have to
be prevented here to keep consistent with the quasi-static
measurement (slow variations of pressure and ﬂow). This
proved to be diﬃcult to achieve in practice. In fact, auto-
oscillations become possible when the reed ceases to act
as a passive resistance (a positive ∂q
∂p , which absorbs en-
ergy from the standing wave inside the reed channel) to
become an active supply of energy ( ∂q
∂p < 0). All real
acoustic resonators are slightly resistive (the input ad-
mittance Yin has a positive real part). This can com-
pensate in part the negative resistance of the reed in its
active region, but only below a threshold pressure, where
the slope of the characteristic curve is smaller than the
real part of Yin for the resonator [12].

One way to avoid auto-oscillations is thus to increase
the real part of Yin, that is the acoustic resistance of the
resonator. It is known that a an oriﬁce in an a acoustical
duct with a steady ﬂow works as an anechoic termina-
tion works as an acoustic resistance [13], so that if the
diaphragm used to measure the ﬂow (see sect. II A) is
correctly dimensioned, the acoustic admittance seen by
the reed Yin can become suﬃciently resistive to avoid
oscillations.

2. Solutions proposed to adress these issues

a. Size of the diaphragm The volume ﬂow is de-
termined from the pressure drop across the diaphragm
placed downstream of the reed.
In practice there’s a
tradeoﬀ that determines the ideal size of the diaphragm.
If it is too wide, the pressure drop is too small to be mea-
sured accurately, and reed oscillations likely to occur. If
the diaphragm is too small, the system-wide character-
istic can become too steep, making part of the ((∆p)r)
range inaccessible.

The ideal diaphragm cross-section is then found em-
pirically, by trying out several resistance values until one
complete measurement can be done without oscillations
or sudden closings of the reed. The optimal diaphragm
diameter is sought using a medical ﬂow regulator with
continuously adjustable cross-section as a replacement for
the diaphragm.

b. Finer control of the mouth pressure pm During
the attempts to ﬁnd an optimal diaphragm, it was found
that sudden closures were correlated to sudden increases
in the mouth pressure. A part of the problem is that
the mouth pressure depends both on the reducer setting
[or conﬁguration] and on the downstream resistance. By
introducing a leak upstream of the experimental appa-
ratus (thus not altering the experiment) , it is possible
to improve measurements in the decreasing region of the
characteristic (BC), at least when the system-wide char-
acteristic is not multi-valued (see section II B 1 a).

c.

Increase the reed mass One other way to reduce
the oscillations is thus to prevent the appearance of in-
stabilities, or to reduce their eﬀects. An increase in the
reed damping would certainly be a good method to avoid
oscillations, because it cancels out the active role of the
reed (which can be seen as a negative damping) [11].

It is diﬃcult to increase the damping of the reed with-
out altering its opening or stiﬀness properties. The sim-
plest way found to prevent reed oscillations was thus an
increase in the reed mass.

This mass increase was implemented by attaching
small masses of Blu-Tack [26] to one or both blades of the
reed (ﬁg. 4). During measurements on previously soaked
reeds it was diﬃcult to keep the masses attached to the
reed, so that an additional portion of Blu-Tack is used
to connect the to masses together, wrapping around the
reed. A comparison of the results using diﬀerent masses
showed that their eﬀect on the quasi-static characteristics
can be neglected.

C. Experimental set-up and calibrations

The experimental device is shown in ﬁgure 5. An ar-
tiﬁcial mouth [6] was used as a blowing mechanism and
support for the reed. The window in front of the reed al-
lows the capture of frontal pictures of the reed opening.
Artiﬁcial lips, allowing to adjust the initial opening
area of the reed were not used here, fearing that they

would modify some of the elastic properties of the reed,
yet diﬀerently from what happens with real lips.

FIG. 5: Device used for characteristics measurements.

As stated before, the plot of the characteristic curve re-
quires two coordinated measurements: the pressure dif-
ference (∆p)r across the reed and the induced volume
ﬂow q, determined from the pressure drop (∆p)d across
a calibrated diaphragm (sect. II A).

In practice thus, the experiment requires two pressure

measurements pm and pr, as shown in ﬁgure 5.

1. Pressure measurements

The pressure is measured in the mouth and in the reed
using Honeywell SCX series, silicon-membrane diﬀeren-
tial pressure sensors whose range is from −50 to 50 kPa.
These sensors are not mounted directly on the mea-
surement points, but one of the terminals in each sen-
sor is connected to the measurement point using a short
ﬂexible tube (about 20 cm in length). Therefore, one
tube opens in the inside wall of the artiﬁcial mouth, 4
cm upstream from the reed, and the other tube crosses
the rubber socket attaching the diaphragm to the reed
output. The use of these tubes does not inﬂuence the
measured pressures as long as their variations are slow.
The signal from these sensors is ampliﬁed before en-
tering the digital acquisition card. The gain is adjusted
for each type of reed. The system consisting of the sen-
sor connected to the ampliﬁer is calibrated as a whole
in order to ﬁnd the voltage at the ampliﬁer output cor-
responding to each pressure diﬀerence in the probe ter-
minals: the stable pressure drop applied to the probe is

linearly with the applied pressure within the measuring
range of the sensor.

to turbulence generated for high Reynolds Numbers. In
ﬁgure 7 the dashed line corresponding to the critical value
of the Reynolds number (Rec = ud
ν = 2000) is shown. It
is calculated using the following formulas for u (the aver-
age ﬂow velocity in the diaphragm) and d (the diaphragm
diameter):

Almeida et Al.

2. Diaphragm calibration

The curve relating volume ﬂow q to the pressure dif-
ference through diaphragms (∆p)d can be approximated
by the Bernoulli theorem. In fact, diaphragms are con-
structed so as to minimize friction eﬀects (by reducing
the length of the diaphragm channel) and jet contraction
— the upstream edges are smoothed by chamfering at
45◦ (ﬁg. 6). The chamfer height (c) is approximately 0.5
mm. The diaphragm channel is 3 mm long (L).

In a typical run, the mouth pressure pm is equilibrated
with the atmospheric pressure in the room in the begin-

in the computer through a digital acquisition device at a
sampling rate of 4000 Hz. pm is increased until slightly
above the pressure at which the reed closes, left for some
seconds above this value and then decreased back to
the atmospheric pressure. The whole procedure lasts for
about 3 minutes, and is depicted in ﬁgure 8.

It was found that the ef-

Vena Contracta eﬀect in the entrance of the diaphragm.
Moreover, above a given pressure drop the volume ﬂow
increase is lower than what is predicted by Bernoulli’s
theorem (corresponding to a lower exponent than 1/2
predicted by Bernoulli). This diﬀerence is probably due

D. Double-reeds used in this study and operating
conditions

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Among the great variety of double-reeds that are used
in music, we chose as a ﬁrst target for these measure-
ments a natural cane oboe-reed fabricated using standard
procedures (by Glotin), and sold to the oboist (usually
a beginner oboist) as a ﬁnal product (i.e., ready to be
played).

The choice of a ready-to-use cane reed was mainly re-
tained because it can be considered as an average reed.
This avoids considering a particular scraping technique
among many used by musicians and reed-makers. Of
course, this does not greatly facilitate the task of the reed
measurement, because natural reeds are very sensitive to
environment conditions, age or time of usage.

Other reeds were also tested, as a term of comparison
with the natural reeds used in most of the experiments.
However, none of these reeds was produced by a pro-
fessional oboist or reed maker, although it would be an
interesting project to investigate the variations in reeds
produced by diﬀerent professionals.

To conclude, the results presented in the next section
may depend to a certain extent on the reed chosen for
the experiments, and a larger sample of reeds embracing
the big diversity of scraping techniques needs to be tested
before claiming for the generality of the results that will
be presented.

Another remark has to be made on the conditions dur-
ing the experiments. The kind of reeds used in most
experiments are always blown with highly moisturised
In fact, in real life, reeds are often soaked before
air.
they are used, and constantly maintained wet by saliva
and water vapour condensation. These conditions were
sought throughout most of the experiments, although
their sensitivity to environmental conditions was also in-
vestigated. For instance, the added masses were found to
have no practical inﬂuence on the nonlinear characteris-
tics, whereas the humidity increases the hysteresis in the
complete measurement cycle (increasing followed by de-
creasing pressures), while reducing the reed opening at
rest [4].

In our measurements, humidiﬁcation is achieved by let-
ting the air ﬂow through a plastic bottle half-ﬁlled with
hot water at 40◦ (see ﬁg. 5), recovering it from the top.
Air arriving in the artiﬁcial mouth has a lower tempera-
ture, because its temperature is approximately 10◦ when
entering the bottle. This causes the temperature and hu-
midity to decrease gradually along the experiments. Fu-
ture measurements should include a thermostat for the
water temperature in order to ensure stable humidiﬁca-
tion

A. Typical pressure vs ﬂow characteristics

Using the formula of eq. (8), and the calibrations car-
ried out for the diaphragm used in the measurement,
the ﬂow is determined from the pressure inside the reed
(pr). The pressure drop in the reed corresponds to
the diﬀerence between the mouth and reed pressures
((∆p)r = pm − pr). Volume ﬂow (q) is then plotted
against the pressure diﬀerence ((∆p)r), yielding a curve
shown in ﬁgure 9.

FIG. 9: A typical result for the measurement of the volume
ﬂow vs pressure characteristic of a natural cane oboe reed.

In this ﬁgure, the ﬂow is seen to increase until a certain
maximum value (at about 6 kPa). When the pressure is
increased further, ﬂow decreases due to the closing of the
reed. Instead of completely vanishing for (∆p)r = pM , as
predicted by the elementary model shown in section I B,
the ﬂow ﬁrst stabilises at a certain minimum value and
then increases when the pressure is increased further.,
indicating that it is very hard to completely close the
reed.

The ﬂow remaining after the two blades are in contact
suggests that despite the closed apparency of the double
reed, some narrow channels remaining between the two
blades are impossible to close, behaving like rigid capil-
lary ducts, which is corroborated by the slight increase
in the residual volume ﬂow for high pressures.

If the residual reed opening is distributed over several
channels, the ﬂow in each of these channels would be con-
trolled by viscosity rather then inertia, so that the volume
ﬂow q should be proportional to (∆p)r rather than to the
1/2 power of it as in the case of a Bernoulli ﬂow. Nev-
ertheless, observing a logarithmic plot of the non-linear
characteristics (ﬁg. 10) shows a 1/2 power dependence of
the residual ﬂow. This may mean that the reed material
is not yet stable at this point.

When reducing the pressure back to zero, the reed fol-
lows a diﬀerent path in the pressure/ﬂow space than the

Apart from these scaling considerations, the shape of

memory eﬀects of the reed material which have been in-
vestigated experimentally for single-reed [10] and double-
reed instruments [5].

B. Comparison with other instruments

Since oboes are not the only double-reed instruments,
it is interesting to compare the non-linear characteristic
curves from diﬀerent instruments. The bassoon is also
played using a double reed, but its dimensions are diﬀer-
ent: its opening area at rest is typically 7 mm2 (against
around 2 mm2 for the oboe) and the cross section proﬁle
varies slightly from oboe reeds.

Figure 11 compares two characteristic curves for nat-
ural cane oboe and bassoon reeds. Both were measured
under similar experimental conditions, as far as possible.
The reed was introduced dry in the artiﬁcial mouth, but
the supplied air is moisturized at nearly 100% humidity,
and masses were added to both reeds to prevent auto-
oscillations. The diaphragms used in each measurement
are diﬀerent however, and this is because the opening
area of the reed at rest is much larger in the case of the
bassoon, so that a smaller resistance (a larger diaphragm)
is needed to avoid that the reed closes suddenly in the de-
creasing side of the characteristic curve (see section II C
and eq. A10). This should not have any consequences in
the measured characteristic curve.

In the q axis, the bassoon reed reaches higher values,
and this is probably a consequence of its larger opening
area at rest, although the surface stiﬀness is likely to
change as well from the oboe to the bassoon reed. In the
p axis, the bassoon reed extends over a smaller range of
pressures so that the reed beating pressure is about 17
kPa in the case of the bassoon reed whereas it is near 33

2. Clarinet

The excitation mechanism of clarinets and saxophones
share the same principle of functioning with double reeds.
However, there are several geometric and mechanical dif-
ferences between single reeds and double reeds. For
instance, ﬂow in a clarinet mouthpiece encounters an
abrupt expansion after the ﬁrst 2 or 3 millimeters of the
channel between the reed and the rigid mouthpiece, and
the single reed is subject to fewer mechanical constraints
than any double reed. These diﬀerences suggest that

the characteristic curve of single-reed instruments might
present some qualitative diﬀerences with respect to the
double reed [20].

The non-linear characteristic curve of clarinet mouth-
pieces displayed in ﬁgures 11 and 12 was measured by S.
Ollivier an J.-P. Dalmont [10] using similar methods as
the ones we used for the double reed. A comparison be-
tween the curves for both kinds of exciters (in ﬁgure 11)
shows that the overall behavior of the excitation mech-
anism is similar in both cases. Similarly to when com-
paring oboe to bassoon reeds, the scalings of the charac-
teristic curves of single-reeds are diﬀerent from those of
oboe reeds, although closer to those of the bassoon. This
is probably a question of the dimensions of the opening
area.

A diﬀerent issue is the relation between reference pres-
sure values in the curve (shown in the adimensionalized
representation of ﬁgure 12). As predicted by the elemen-
tary model described in section I B, in the single reed the
pressure at maximum ﬂow is about 1/3 of the beating
pressure of the reed, whereas in double-reed measure-
ments, the relation seems to be closer to 1/4. This devi-
ation from the model is shown in section IV to be linked
with the diﬀuser eﬀect of the conical staple in double-
reeds.

Figure 12 also shows that in the clarinet mouthpiece
used by S. Ollivier and J. P. Dalmont the hysteresis is rel-
atively less important than in both kinds of double-reeds.
In fact, whereas the measurements for double-reeds were
performed in wet conditions, the PlastiCover r(cid:13) reed used
for the clarinet was especially chosen because of its
smaller sensitivity to environment conditions.

In fact, it can be easily
shown that for the elementary model this value is 1/3
of the reed beating pressure pM , which is also veriﬁed in
the clarinet (sect. III B 2). In the measured curves how-
ever, this value is usually situated between 1/4pM and
1/5pM .

Nevertheless, the shapes of the curves are qualitatively

similar to the theoretical ones.

IV. ANALYSIS

A. Comparison with the elementary model

The measured non-linear characteristic curve of ﬁgure
9 can be compared to the model described in section I B.
In this model, two parameters (ks and S0) control the
scaling of the curve along the p and q axis. They are
used to adjust two key points in the theoretical curve to
the experimental one: the reed beating pressure pM and
the maximum volume ﬂow qmax.

Once qmax is determined through a direct reading, the

stiﬀness ks is calculated using the following relation:

ks = q−

(cid:19)

(12)

This allows to adjust a theoretical characteristic curve
(corresponding to the elementary model of equation (4))
to each of the branches of the measured characteristic
curve, for increasing and decreasing pressures (ﬁg. 13).

When compared to the elementary model of section
I B, the characteristic curve associated to double-reeds
shows a deviation of the pressure at which the ﬂow

The former observations about the displacement of the
maximum value can be analysed in terms of the pres-
sure recoveries due to ﬂow decelerations inside the reed
duct. Variations in the ﬂow velocity are induced by the
increasing cross-section of the reed towards the reed out-
put (ﬁg. 14). This can be understood simply by consider-
ing energy and mass conservation between two diﬀerent
sections of the reed:

either at the input or the output of the conical diﬀuser
by integrating the ﬂow velocity over the cross-section Sin
or Sout respectively.

In practice however, energy is not expected to be com-
pletely conserved along the ﬂow because of its turbulent
nature. In fact, for instance at the reed output (diameter
d), the Reynolds number of the ﬂow (Re = ud
πdν )
can be estimated using data from ﬁgure 9 to reach a max-
imum value of 5000. Given that this number is inversely
proportional to the diameter of the duct d, the Reynolds
increases upstream, inside the reed duct, so that the ﬂow
is expected to be turbulent also for lower volume ﬂows.

For turbulent ﬂows, no theoretical model can be ap-
plied to calculate the pressure recovery due to the taper-
ing of the reed duct. However, phenomenological models
are available in engineering literature, where similar duct
geometries are known as “conical diﬀusers”. Unlike in
clarinet mouthpieces, where the sudden expansion of the
proﬁle is likely to cause a turbulent mixing without pres-
sure recovery [17], this eﬀect must be considered in coni-
cal diﬀusers. The pressure recovery is usually quantiﬁed
in terms of a recovery coeﬃcient CP stating the relation
between the pressure diﬀerence between both ends of the
diﬀuser and the ideal pressure recovery which would be
achieved if the ﬂow was stopped without losses:

1. Reed model with pressure recovery

In order to take into account the pressure recovery be-
fore the reed output, the ﬂow is divided into two sections,
the upstream, until the constriction at 28 mm (index c
in ﬁg. 14) and the conical diﬀuser part from the constric-
tion until the reed output. In the upstream section, no
pressure recovery is considered, so that the ﬂow velocity
can be calculated using the pressure diﬀerence between
the mouth and this point using a Bernoulli model, as in
equation (3), but replacing pr with pc:

q = S

(15)

Similarly, the reed opening is calculated using the same

pressure diﬀerence:

(∆p)c = pm − pc = kS(S0 − S)

(16)

The total pressure diﬀerence used to plot the charac-
teristic curve, however, is diﬀerent, because the recovered
pressure has to be added to (∆p)c:

pm − pr = (∆p)c − Cp

where Sc is the reed duct cross-section at the diﬀuser

Using these equations, the modiﬁed model can be ﬁt-
ted to the experimental data.
In ﬁgure 15, the same
parameters ks and S0 were used as in ﬁgure 13, leaving
only Cp as a free parameter for the ﬁtting. Figure 15 was
obtained for a value of Cp = 0.8.

CP values range from 0 (no recovery) to 1 (complete re-
covery, never achieved in practice). Distributed losses
due to laminar viscosity along the reed are neglected.

According to equation (14), pressure recovery is pro-
portional to the square of the ﬂow velocity at the en-
trance of the conical diﬀuser, and consequently to the
squared volume ﬂow inside the reed. This is coherent
with the shifting of the double-reed non-linear character-
istics curve for high volume ﬂows, as observed in ﬁgure
13.

FIG. 15: Comparison of the experimental non-linear charac-

the ﬁnal part of the duct. Fitted ks and S0 are the same as
in ﬁgure 13 and diﬀerent for increasing and decreasing mouth
pressures. In both cases the value Cp = 0.8 was used.

This value can be compared to typical values of pres-
sure recovery coeﬃcients found in industrial machines,
for example in [7].

Almeida et Al.

In engineering literature, CP is found to depend mostly
on the ratio between output and input cross-sections
(AR = Sout/Sin) and the diﬀuser length to initial diame-
ter ratio (L/din) [21]. The tapering angle θ inﬂuences the
growth of the boundary layers, so that above a critical
angle (θ = 8◦) the ﬂow is known to detach from the dif-
fuser walls considerably lowering the recovered pressure.
An in-depth study of turbulent ﬂow in conical diﬀusers
can be found in the literature [7] usually for diﬀusers
with much larger dimensions than the ones found in the
double reed.

The geometry of the conical diﬀuser studied in [7] can
be compared to the one studied in our work: the cross-
section is circular and the tapering angle θ = 3.94◦ is not
very far from the tapering angle of the reed staple θ =
5.2◦ (in particular, both are situated in regions of similar
ﬂow regimes [18] as a function of the already mentioned
AR and L/din). Reynolds numbers of his ﬂows (Re =
6.9 × 104) are also close to the maximum ones found at
the staple input (Re ≃ 104).

The length to input diameter ratio of the reed staple
L/d = 20 is bigger than that found in [7], however the
pressure recovery coeﬃcient can be extrapolated from his
data to ﬁnd the value CP ≃ 0.8 (ﬁg. 2 in [7]).

are quasi-static). Some clues indicate that this could also
be put into question:

• First of all, experimental observations of the ﬂow
at the output of the staple (through hot-wire mea-
surements [4]) revealed signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the
ﬂow patterns when considering static and auto-
oscillating reeds.

• Moreover, non-dimensional analysis reveal Strouhal
numbers much larger than for simple reed instru-
ments ([20], [4])

APPENDIX A: CALCULATION OF THE
MINIMUM DIAPHRAGM CROSS-SECTION

V. CONCLUSION

(ﬁg. 2) is:

The total pressure drop in the reed-diaphragm system

The quasi-static non-linear characteristics was mea-
sured for double reeds using a similar device as for single-
reed mouthpieces [10]. The obtained curves are close to
the ones found for single-reeds, and in particular no evi-
dence of multivalued ﬂows for a same pressure was found,
as was suggested by some theoretical considerations [22],
[20].

Double-reed characteristic curves present substantial
quantitative diﬀerences for high volume ﬂows when com-
pared to elementary models for the reed. These diﬀer-
ences can be explained using a model of pressure recovery
in the conical staple, proportional to the input ﬂow ve-
locity.

It is worth noting that direct application of this mea-
surement to the modelling of the complete oboe is not
that obvious. Indeed, the assumption that the mouth-
piece as a whole (reed plus staple) can be modelled as
a non-linear element with characteristics given by the
above experiment would be valid if the size of the mouth-
piece was negligible with respect to a typical wavelength.
Given the 7 cm of the mouthpiece and the 50 cm of a typ-
ical wavelength, this is questionable. Should the staple
be considered as part of the resonator? In that case, the
separation between the exciter and the resonator would
reveal a longuer resonator and an exciter without pres-
sure recovery. This could be investigated through nu-
merical simulations by introducing the pressure recovery
coeﬃcient (CP ) as a free parameter.

Moreover, the underlying assuption of the models is
that non stationnary eﬀects are negligible (all ﬂow models

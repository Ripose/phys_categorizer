INTRODUCTION

The standard formal way that expressions for the relativistic momentum p and the rela-

tivistic kinetic energy T , and the mass–energy relationship E = mc2 are derived in upper-

level undergraduate textbooks1 is by ﬁrst introducing Lorentz transformations and 4-vectors,

and then deﬁning the 4-momentum vector pµ = m dxµ/dτ (µ = 0, 1, 2, 3), where τ is the

proper time. It is then postulated, backed up by extensive experimental observations, that

in an isolated system all the components of pµ are conserved. The spatial components of

pµ reduce to mv in the non-relativistic limit, and hence correspond to the components of

the relativistic momentum. The temporal component reduces in the non-relativistic limit

to mc2 + mv2/2, and therefore is identiﬁed as the total energy, composed of the rest-mass

and kinetic energies. Logically, there is of course nothing wrong with this approach. Ped-

agogically, however, it is probably helpful to have more intuitive derivations. To this end,

through the years many have been published.2

This paper describes relatively simple and concise derivations of the relativistic forms of

p and T , and E = mc2, based on (i) conservation of momentum and energy in the collisions

of two particles, and (ii) the velocity addition rules. Momentum and energy conservation

should be familiar concepts to students, and the velocity addition rules can be quite simply

derived from the constancy of the speed of light in all inertial reference frames.3 In each

derivation, collisions are viewed in the center-of-momentum frame of reference, Scm, in which

both particles have momenta that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, and

in the laboratory frame of reference, Slab, in which one of the particles initially is at rest.

Imposition of the conservation laws gives the desired expressions.

To simplify the algebra, velocities in this paper are expressed in units of c, the speed of

light. Hence velocities are dimensionless, and c = 1. To obtain the standard dimensional

expressions, replace all velocities in the expressions given here by v

v/c, and multiply all

masses by c2 in order to obtain energy. Also, in this paper primes on variables denote “after

→

collision.”

II. THE DERIVATIONS

First, let us recall the relativistic velocity transformation rules. Let ˜S be an inertial

frame moving with velocity (u, 0) with respect to frame S. If a particle has velocity (vx, vy)
in frame S, the components of its velocity in frame ˜S are1,3

A. Relativistic momentum

From dimensional analysis and the vector4 nature of momentum, the momentum of a

particle of mass m travelling with velocity v must have the form

p = mγv v,

(2)

where γv is an unknown function to be determined. Since p = mv for non-relativistic

velocities, γv→0 = 1.

Consider the case where the particles are identical, hence m1 = m2 = m. Let the motion

of the particles be in the x–y plane and their initial velocities in Scm be

(v, 0). Assume

±

that the particles barely graze each other, so that in the collision each particle picks up

a very small y-component of the velocity of magnitude δv in Scm.

[See Fig. 1(a).] Their

speeds in Scm do not change because the collision is elastic, and hence their velocities after

the collision are

δv. Because δv is assumed to be very small, we ignore all terms of order (δv)2 and higher.

Now consider the collision in the laboratory frame of reference Slab that is moving with

velocity (

v, 0) with respect to Scm.

[See Fig. 1(b).] The pre-collision velocities of the

−

particles Slab, using Eqs. (1) on the Scm velocities

(v, 0), are v1,lab = (w, 0), where

and v2,lab = (0, 0). After the collision, transforming the post-collision Scm velocities

B. Relativistic kinetic energy

Dimensional analysis and the scalar4 property of kinetic energy imply that its form is

where m is the mass of the particle, v =

is its speed and the function G(v) is to be

determined.

Consider an elastic head-on collision between two particles, of mass m and M

m, with

≫

speeds in Scm of v and V , respectively. In Scm, the particles simply reverse directions, and

the motion is one-dimensional.

[See Fig. 2(a).] Assume that the mass M is so large that

in frame Scm its speed V

1, and hence we can use the non-relativistic expressions for the

≪

momentum and kinetic energy of mass M. The magnitudes of the momenta of m and M

are equal in Scm, implying

C. E = mc2

Consider the initial situation as in Sec. II B, except that the speed V of mass M can be

relativistic, and after collision the two particles merge into one composite particle. In Scm,

MγV V = mγvv, and after the collision the composite particle is stationary. In Slab which is

moving with velocity

V with respect to Scm, before the collision particle M is stationary

−

5

and particle m moves with velocity vlab = (v + V )/(1 + vV ), and after the collision the

composite particle moves with velocity V .

The total momentum in Slab before the collision is Plab = mγ|vlab|vlab = mγvγV (u +

V ).

If the mass of the composite particle does not change, then the momentum of the

composite particle after the collision in Slab would be (M + m)γV V

= Plab in general,

violating conservation of momentum. Therefore, the mass of the composite particle must

change by ∆m such that momentum is conserved in Slab; i.e.,

Substituting mγvv = MγV V on the left hand side and cancelling γV V on both sides gives

mγvγV (v + V ) = (M + m + ∆m)γV V.

∆m = m(γv −

1) + M(γV −

1).

(15)

(16)

From Sec. II B, the right hand side of Eq. (16) is equal to

∆T , the total change in kinetic

energy in Scm (since particles m and M start with speeds v and V , respectively, and both

are stationary at the end). By conservation of total energy, ∆E + ∆T = 0, where ∆E is the

energy associated with the change in mass. Hence, ∆E =

∆T = ∆m or (reintroducing

c, and making the plausible assumption that a zero mass object with zero velocity has zero

energy) E = mc2. Finally, combining the results of Sections II B and II C gives the total
energy of a particle of mass m moving with speed v, E + T = Etotal = mγvc2.

III. CONCLUDING REMARKS

It should be noted that these derivations do not guarantee that the momentum and total

energy are conserved in all inertial reference frames or in all collisions. They only show the

forms that the momentum, kinetic energy and energy–mass relation must have, given mo-

mentum and energy conservation. Once these expressions are known, when the 4-momentum

is introduced its components will be recognized as the total energy and momentum. The

covariance of the momentum 4-vector can then be used to demonstrate momentum and to-

tal energy conservation in all inertial frames. Conservation of momentum can be shown to

be a consequence of conservation of energy,6 and, as beﬁtting an experimental science, the

6

conservation of energy ultimately depends on experimental observations.

Theory of acoustic analog of magneto-optic

polar Kerr eﬀect under magnon-phonon

resonance

1 Introduction

The acoustic analog of magneto-optic Kerr eﬀect consists of variation of the
polarization of the elastic wave after its reﬂection from an interface between
magnetic medium and isotropic non-magnetic one. Quantitative character-
istics of the eﬀects are polarization parameters: ε – the ellipticity which
modulus is the ratio of the minor and major ellipse axes and φ – the angle
of rotation of the polarization plane or, more correctly, of the major ellipse
axis if ε 6= 0.

There are three possible variants according to directions of the static
magnetic induction B, plane of incidence of the wave and the unit vector q
normal to the interface plane: polar (B k q); meridional (or longitudinal)
( q × k ⊥ B); and equatorial (or transverse) (q × k k B). The incident
waves are called p-type if the elastic displacement vector u is perpendicular
to q × k, and s-type if u is parallel to this vector.

The acoustic analog of the Kerr eﬀect was predicted by Vlasov and Kuleev
[1]. Theory of the eﬀect for an inclined incidence of a wave was developed
by Vlasov and Babushkin [2]. In this paper an isotropic magnetic medium
(at B = 0) was discussed.

Here we consider the following model. The medium I is a semi-inﬁnite
isotropic non-magnetic and non-dissipative while the medium II is a fer-
romagnetic one with cubic lattice and easy axis along [111]-type crystallo-
graphic direction. The interface is perpendicular to the [001] axis and the
plane of incidence is given by the equation x = 0. The medium II has a form
of a sphere with a small (respectively the radius of the sphere) plane area
contacting with the medium I.

In this case the elastic displacements of the reﬂected shear waves u′ may

be represented by a sum of mutually orthogonal vectors u′

x and u′

⊥, where

u′
x = u′

xex

and

u′

⊥ = u′

⊥e⊥,

(1)

and ex and e⊥ are unit vectors. By introducing reﬂection coeﬃcients R±
n for
circular components deﬁned by R±
⊥/un and expressing them
in the form R±
n ), we obtain expressions for the ellipticity and
the rotation of the polarization of an elastic wave of n-type upon reﬂection
from the interface as

n | exp(iρ ±

x/un ± iu′

n = |R±

In deﬁnition (1) and later on a symbol with a prime relates to characteristics
of a reﬂected wave, with two primes – to refracted (transmitted to the second
medium) and without primes – to the incident wave; n may refer to shear
mode of arbitrary linear polarization.

2 Boundary conditions

We will consider classical approach given in Ref. 3 and generalize it to the
case of magnetoelastic interaction in one of the contacting media. Thus, the
boundary conditions require continuity of the displacements at the interface,
and of the force acting on the interface:

(4)

The sums in Eqs. (3)–(4) contain contributions of all the normal (eigen)
modes that have elastic displacements. In harmonic approximation the bound-
ary conditions can be presented as ones for complex amplitudes and phases.
The last one leads to the following conclusions: frequences of all the waves
(incident, reﬂected, and refracted) are equal, all the wave vectors belong to
a common plane, namely, the plane of incidence, and, besides,

i that of reﬂection, corresponding to the
j that of refraction, corresponding to the

The boundary conditions given by Eqs. (3)–(4) should be appended with

ones for variable magnetization those were formulated in Ref. 1.

Remind: all the eigen modes that have elastic displacements should be
represented in boundary conditions and the tensions due to the magnetoe-
lastic interaction should be in Eq. (4).

There are three such solutions for an isotropic dielectric medium: one

longitudinal and two degenerate transverse.

For the magnetic medium, in general, there should be ﬁve solutions. How-
ever, here we will consider a weak-coupling approximation. In this approx-
imation the interaction between the subsystems results in small variation
of the dispersion curves of normal modes which become coupled phonon-
magnon (or phonon-like) and magnon-phonon (or magnon-like) ones). Only
three elastic-like modes can be accounted in Eqs. (3)–(4) and boundary con-
ditions for magnetization are not used for obtaining R±
n .

3 System of equations for determination of

normal modes

To obtain the wave vectors and complex amplitudes of the eigen modes it is
necessary to solve the equations of the elasticity theory for the ﬁrst medium
and for the second one – the system consiting of Maxwell’s equations, equa-
tion of motion for magnetization, and equations of elasticity theory. We
propose that the crystal is in magnetically saturated state and only small
variations of magnetization can occur.
Thus, for the ﬁrst medium we have

with tensions τij deﬁned by

ρ1 ¨ui =

∂τij
∂xj

,

τij =

∂W
∂εij

,

(6)

(7)

where ρ1 is the density of the medium I, εij = 1
2 (∂ui/∂xj + ∂uj/∂xi) are
components of strain (or deformation) tensor, and the density of free energy
W contains only the elastic energy WL.

For the second medium we have equation of motion for volume element
similar to (6). However, the free energy which deﬁnes the tensions and eﬀec-

3

tive ﬁeld He should be presented by elastic, magnetic, and magnetoelastic
terms.

Formally, we should use the superscript ′′ on all of the parameters and
variables related to the magnetic medium, but we will defer this until such
terms for all of the waves, incident, reﬂected, and transmitted, appear in the
same expression.

It is preferable to write the equation of motion for magnetization in the

form of the Gilbert equation:

˙M = γM × He +

α0
M0

M × ˙M,

(8)

where α0 is the relaxation parameter, M0 is the modulus of static magneti-
zation in homogeous state, and M is total magnetization.

The density of total free energy of a magnetic crystal in addition to elastic
and magnetoelastic energy, contains Zeeman energy W0, exchange energy
Wex, energy of magnetic anisotropy Wa, and magnetostatic energy Wd. The
last two terms determines the ﬁeld of magnetic anisotropy Ha and the static
H0
d and variable h demagnetizing ﬁelds. We will use demagnetizing factor
corresponding to a spherical specimen considering the plane areas as small.
Expressions for the types of energy and ﬁelds can be found in Ref. 4.

Since we are limiting ourselves to the case where all wave vectors lie in

the y − z plane, the complete system has the form

a11u1 + a14m1 = 0,
a22u2 + a23u3 + a25m2 = 0,
a32u2 + a33u3 + a35m2 = 0,
a42u2 + a43u3 + a44m1 + a45m2 = 0,
a51u1 + a54m1 + a55m2 = 0,

proportional to exp [i (ωt − k · r)].

Existing of non-trivial solutions of the system (9) requires its determinant
to be equal to the zero. It is dispersion equation since it gives expressions
for the wave vectors of eigen modes. As the angle of incidence is given and
therefore, according to Eq. (5), Re(k2) for all of the eigenvectors is deﬁned,
the unknown values are Re(k3), Im(k3), and Im(k2).

4 Solution of dispersion equation

Using the last two equations of (9), we may express m1 and m2 as functions
of u1, u2, and u3:

mi = bijuj,

(10)

substitute these expressions into the ﬁrst three equations, and set the deter-
minant of the new system (containing these three equations) equal to zero:

(a11 + a14b11)

× [(a22 + a25b22) (a33 + a35b23) − (a32 + a35b22) (a23 + a25b23)]
− a14b12 [a25b21 (a33 + a35b23) − a35b21 (a23 + a25b23)]
+ a14b13 [a25b21 (a32 + a35b22) − a35b21 (a22 + a25b22)] = 0,

(11)

where

a44a55 − a54a45

a43a54

a44a55 − a54a45

,

We will solve the dispersion equation (11) by an iterative method. The
zero order approximation will be obtained by letting the elements describing
the magnon-phonon interaction (i.e., a14, a25, a35, a41, a42, a43, a51, a52, and
a53) vanish. One of the solutions is

3 = ρω2c−1
k2

1313 − k2
2,

whereas the next two are

k2

3 = −P ±(cid:16)P 2 − Q(cid:17)1/2

,

5

(13)

(14)

where

P = h(cid:16)c2

1111 + c2

1313 − (c1122 + c1313)2(cid:17) k2

−ρω2 (c1313 + c1111)i (2c1111c1313)−1 ,

2 (c1313 + c1111) + c1313c1111k4
2,

Q = ρ2ω4 − ρω2k2

Eqs. (13)–(14) for k3 relate to pure elastic waves: transverse s-type mode
with wave vector ks, quasi-transverse (quasi-p) mode with wave vector kp,
and quasi-longitudinal (quasi-l) mode with wave vector kl. At this point we
have obtained real wave vectors (i.e., their imaginary parts are zero), since
energy dissipation is considered to be in the magnetic subsystem only.

Next, the resulting expressions for k3 should be substituted in turn into
the equations which describe the magnetic subsystem and the magnon-phonon
interaction. Recall that all k2 in the zeroth approximation are real, equal, and
known. Thus the solution for k3 relating to the ﬁrst weakly-coupled phonon-
magnon mode (now of the quasi-s type, since it has y and z components of
the elastic displacement) is

(k3)2

qs = −k2

c1313 hρω2 + a14b11 + [(a22 + a25b22) (a33 + a35b23)

− (a32 + a35b22) (a23 + a25b23)]−1
× [a14b13 [a25b21 (a32 + a35b22) − a35b21 (a22 + a25b22)]
−a14b12 [a25b21 (a33 + a35b23) − a35b21 (a23 + a25b23)]]] ,

(15)

where all aij and bmn are functions of (k3)s.

The other two solutions relating to the coupled phonon-like modes are
written in the form of (14), however the parameter Q should now be given
by

Q = ρ2ω4 − ρω2hk2

2 (c1313 + c1111)i + c1313c1111k4

2 + a35a22b23 + a25a33b22
−a32a25b23 − a35a23b22 − a14 [a11 + a14b11]−1
× [b12 [a25b21 (a33 + a35b23) − a35b21 (a23 + a25b23)]
−b13 [a25b21 (a32 + a35b22) − a35b21 (a22 + a25b22)]] . (16)

Note that the solution of Eq. (14) with the + sign before the root describes
the coupled quasi-p mode for which all aij and bkn in Eq. (16) are functions
of (k3)p, whereas that with the − sign describes the coupled quasi-l mode for
which all aij and bkn are functions of (k3)l.

Having obtained the complex z components of the wave vectors, we can
now determine the imaginary part of the y components for a particular k =

6

kek, where k is a complex quantity and ek is a unit vector in the k direction.
Thus, the deﬁnition Re(ki) = Re[k cos(k · ei)] should also be correct for the
imaginary parts of the wave vector components. For every kqj it follows that

Im(k2)qj = Im(k3)qj

cos(k · e3)
cos(k · e2)

= Im(k3)qj

Re(k2)qj
Re(k3)qj

,

where the index q stands for quasi- and j for s, p, or l.

To illustrate the diﬀerences in the positions of magnon-phonon resonances
for waves of diﬀerent polarizations and to compare them with data for θ = 0,
Fig. 1 shows the resonant frequency ωr versus magnetic ﬁeld calculated for a
YIG single crystal. This frequency is determined by requiring that the real
part of the resonant denominator a44a55 −a54a45 in the deﬁnitions of bij given
by expresions (12) vanish. Recall that θ is the angle of incidence, while the
angle of refraction for θ 6= 0 depends on H at a particular frequency and
therefore cannot be a ﬁxed property of curves B–D. It can be seen that in
general one can observe manifestation of three resonances in the properties
of a reﬂected wave.

5 Complex amplidutes of vibrations and ten-

sions

The complex amplitudes of the elastic vibrations and tensions (elastic and
magnetoelastic) can be written by inserting the eigen wave vectors into the
system (9). In both cases magnetization is expressed in terms of u1, u2, and
u3 according to Eq. (10) .

The ﬁrst three equations of (9), written in the form

cmnun = 0 (m, n = 1, 2, 3)

(17)

yield complex amplitudes expressed in terms of those which do not vanish for
b2 → 0 and θ → 0 (i.e., in terms of U ′′
2p for quasi-p, and
U ′′
3l for quasi-l; we omit the q index here and later on for complex amplitudes
and wave vectors in magnetic medium), c11 = a11 + a14b11, c12 = a14b12, c13 =
a14b13, c21 = a25b21, c22 = a22 + a25b22, c23 = a23 + a25b33, c31 = a35b21, c32 =
a32 + a35b22, c23 = a33 + a35b33, bij are deﬁned by (12).

1s for quasi-s mode, U ′′

So in the magnetic medium we have the following expressions for the
complex amplitudes of phonon-like quasi-s, -p, and -l modes where we denote
their wave vectors by k′′

Finally, we have a system of six inhomogeneous linear equations in six
s and U ′
p
⊥, respectively, in the deﬁnition (1)),
p =

unknowns. Our particular interest is in U ′
are complex amplitudes of u′

p/Up.

Thus, after solving the system (20), we have obtained all the data required

to determine ε and φ from Eqs. (2).

To illustrate the phenomena, Fig. 2 shows the Kerr rotation and ellipticity
which occur at a quartz-YIG interface. Calculations performed on the basis
of the scheme given in section 4 show that variations of the wave vector
related to a quasi-s type mode exceed those of quasi-p and quasi-l modes by
factors of 102 and 103, respectively. As a consequence, only the z component
of ∆k′′
s is shown in this ﬁgure to compare with the behaviors of ε(H) and
φ(H). Remember we assumed that the ferromagnet is in a magnetically
homogeneous state, thus the results are valid only above the ﬁeld of magnetic
saturation, HS = 667 Oe. In Fig. 2 (b), (c), (e), and (f) these parts of the
curves are shown as solid lines. It follows that only the high ﬁeld wing of
the curves can be observed at the frequency of 53.5 MHz with the relaxation
parameter α0 > 0.1.

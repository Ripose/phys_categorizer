Abstract

Special relativity theory is generalized to two or more “maximal” sig-
In such a framework, relativistic space-time frames are

valid relative to the particular context in which they are deﬁned.

Theory exerts a conservative inﬂuence in declining that faster-than-light
or “superluminal” information communication and travel is conceivable. The
orthodox view pretends that relativity theory excludes superluminal phenomena
for various reasons — e.g., time paradoxes or the necessity to invest “large”
(inﬁnite) amounts of energy for subluminal objects to even reach the speed of
light.

Accordingly, any experimental, empirical claim of allegedly superluminal
phenomena is confronted with the strongest resistance from the theoretical or-
thodoxy [Nim]. One purpose of this report will be the attempt to free exper-
iments from this pressure of the theoretical orthodoxy. It will be argued that
superluminal signalling per se is accountable and does not necessarily imply
“phenomenologic” inconsistency.

First we shortly review the constructions and conventions applied to obtain
the Lorentz transformations. Thereby we wish to segregate the formal from
the physical content of relativity theory. Then we consider situations when two
signal types are used for clock synchronization, whereby two diﬀerent sets of
Lorentz frames are generated. This may seem implausible and even misleading
at ﬁrst glance, since from two diﬀerent “maximal” signal velocities only one can
be truly maximal. This maximal one appears to be the natural candidate for the
generation of Lorentz frames. However, for certain reasons it may be physically
reasonable to consider frames obtained by non maximal speed signalling. In such
a system theoretic setup, possibilities to avoid inconsistencies in the intrinsic
descriptions of such frames are discussed.

No attempt is made here to totally rederive or reconstruct relativity theory
[Sch88, SS92,
by a physically motivated axiomatic framework (cf., e.g., refs.
Sch92]; see also the very nice review by Schelb [Sch97]).
In particular, no
attempt is being made to motivate the identiﬁcation of space-time with a dif-
ferentiable manifold such as R4, as well as of space-time distances with the
Lorentz-Minkowski distance. We also do not review the explicit construction of
radar coordinates by “maximal” signals.

As pointed out before, we merely attempt to segregate the constructive from
the physical content of the theory of relativity and its consequences for situations
when two diﬀerent “maximal” signalling speeds are assumed.

Let c denote the velocity of light. A geometric argument known as Alexan-
drov’s theorem [Ale50, Ale67a, Ale67b, Ben92, Les95, Rob14, Zee64, Heg72,
BH72, Gol87] states that one-to-one mappings ϕ : R4 → R4 preserving the
Lorentz-Minkowski distance for light signals

0 = c2(tx − ty)2 − (x − y)2 = c2(t′

x − t′

y)2 − (x′ − y′)2,

x = (tx, x), y = (ty, y) ∈ R4 are Lorentz transformations

x′ = ϕ(x) = αLx + a

(A generalization to Rn is straightforward.)
up to an aﬃne scale factor α.
In this view, the Lorentz transformations are essentially a consequence of the
convention of the invariance of the speed of light alone. Such a convention is,
for instance, implemented by the International System of standard units [SI].

Thus, stated pointedly, space-time transformations appear to be the result
of conventions rather than of deep physics. Starting from the constancy of the
speed of light amounts to introducing relativity theory “upside down,” since in
retrospect and in standard reviews [Ein05, Ein56, SU76] the Michelson-Morley
experiment is presented as an experimental ﬁnding supporting the assumption
of the constancy of light in all reference frames. However, it should be kept
in mind that the operational procedures implemented by clocks, scales and
synchronization procedures, in particular radar coordinates [Sch88, Sch97], are
[MS77a, Bel76,
themselves based upon various assumptions and conventions.
Bel92, Gr¨u74].

In contrast, the relativity principle, stating the form invariance of the phys-
ical laws under such Lorentz transformations, conveys the nontrivial physical
content. In this way, special relativity theory is eﬀectively split into a section
dealing with geometric conventions and a diﬀerent one dealing with the repre-
sentation of physical phenomena.

This top-down approach to special relativity should be compared to a bottom-
up approach pursued, among others, by FitzGerald [Whi53], J´anossy [J´an71],
Toﬀoli [Tof78], Erlichson [Erl73], Bell [Bel76, Bel92], Reza Mansouri and Roman
U. Sexl [MS77a, MS77b, MS77c], Svozil [Svo83, Svo86a, Svo86b], Shupe [Shu85]

and G¨unther [G¨un96]. There, relativistic forms are derived from “ether”-type
theories.

Therefore if, instead of light, we would use sound waves or water waves for
synchronization purposes and if we would attempt to generate inertial frames
with sound signals, then very similar “relativistic eﬀects” would result, but at
a speed lower than the speed of light. Such subluminal coordinates, as they
may be called, may be useful for intermediate description levels [And72, Sch93].
Moreover, we may consider faster-than-light “signalling” generating superlumi-
nal coordinates [Rec86, SS86]. Faster-than-light “signalling” can, for instance,
be realized by superluminal charge-current patterns; e.g., by the coordinated
motion of aggregates of electrically charged particles [BG72, Ard84].
(Such
“signals” cannot convey useful information and therefore do not give rise to
violations of causality and contradictions.) This may then yield a clearer un-
derstanding of seemingly “paradoxical” eﬀects such as time travel [G¨od49a,
G¨od49b, G¨od90a, Rec87].

Therefore, it may not appear unreasonable to consider generalized system
representations in which more than one signalling speeds are used to generate
space and time scales. The transformation properties of such scales are then
deﬁned relative to the signal invoked.

Let us therefore assume two signalling velocities c < ¯c. For the sake of the
argument, we shall consider two sets of inertial frames Σ, ¯Σ associated with c and
¯c, respectively. The set of all inertial frames Σ is constructed by a priori and ad
hoc assuming that c is constant. The set of all inertial frames ¯Σ is constructed
by a priori and ad hoc assuming that ¯c is constant. The construction of Σ and
¯Σ via Alexandrov’s principle is quite standard. Since c and ¯c are deﬁned to be
constant, two (aﬃne) Lorentz transformations

x′ = ϕ(x) = αLx + a
¯x′ = ¯ϕ(¯x) = ¯α ¯L¯x + ¯a

and

result for Σ and ¯Σ, respectively. (In what follows, the aﬃne factors α, ¯α are set
to unity.) We shall also refer to these space and time scales as c-space, c-time,
and ¯c-space, ¯c-time, respectively.

The rules for constructing space-time diagrams for the twodimensional prob-
lem (time and one space axis) are straightforward. The Lorentz transformations
(1) and (2) for a = ¯a = 0 yield

ϕv(x) = (t′, x′

From now on, we shall write x and ¯x for x1 and ¯x1, respectively. The second
and third spatial coordinate will be omitted.

Consider faster-than-c velocities v in the range

c < v ≤ ¯c.

(7)

For this velocity range, the Lorentz transformations (3), in particular γ, become
imaginary in the Σ-frames. Therefore, Σ cannot account for such velocities. For
¯Σ, these velocities are perfectly meaningful, being smaller than or equal to ¯c.

The x′- and t′-axis is obtained by setting t = 0 and x = 0, respectively. One

obtains

for the t- and ¯t-axis, respectively.

In general, c2t2 − x2 6= ¯c2¯t2 − ¯x2, except for c = ¯c and the coordinate frames
cannot be directly compared. Thus the standard way of identifying unities does
no longer work. We may, nevertheless, generalize relativity theory by requiring

c2t2 − x2 = ¯c2¯t2 − ¯x2.

In this case, the identiﬁcations for unity are straightforward.

Another possibility is to proceed by constructing radar coordinates in the
following operational way. Let us require that Σ and ¯Σ have the same origin.
That is,

(t, x) = (0, 0) ⇔ (¯t, ¯x) = (0, 0).
(8)
Furthermore, let us consider coordinate frames Σ and ¯Σ which are at rest with
respect to each other. As a consequence of the standard Einstein synchronization
conventions, two events which occur at the same c-time in Σ also occur at the
same ¯c-time in ¯Σ.

Let us ﬁrst assume that we proceed by ﬁxing one and the same unit of
distance for both coordinate systems; i.e., x = ¯x.
In such a case, the radar
time coordinate ¯t can be expressed in terms of the radar time coordinate t by
¯t = (¯c/c)t. This is illustrated in Figure 1. In c-time 1, the faster signal with
velocity ¯c has been relayed back and forth the reﬂecting walls by a factor ¯c/c.
Thus in summary, the transformation laws in this case are

(¯t(t, x), ¯x(t, x)) = (

t, x).

A more general conversion between Σ and ¯Σ involving moving coordinates
is obtained by applying successively the inverse Lorentz transformation (3) and

Instead of identical space coordinates for two frames at rest with respect to
each other, we could have chosen invariant time coordinates in both frames. A

twodimensional coordinate frames generated for ¯Σ. The shaded region with

frames.

Since ¯c > c, superluminal signalling by any velocity v with ¯c ≥ v > c with

point of view, result in quasi-time paradoxes, such as Tolman’s [Tol17, BBN79,
Rec86, Rec87] or G¨odel’s paradoxa [G¨od49a, G¨od49b, G¨od90a]. They originate
from the fact that, given superluminal signalling, signalling back in c-time is
conceivable, making a diagonalization argument [Can95, Can97, Rog67, Odi89]
similar to the classical liar [And70] possible [Svo95]. Stated pointedly: given
free will, this would enable an agent to send a signal backwards in time if and
only if the agent has not received this message before. Or, in a more violent
version, kill the agent’s own grandfather in early childhood. Likewise, this would
allow an agent to become very knowledgeable, powerful and rich, which is not
necessarily paradoxical.

To illustrate the quasi-paradoxical nature of the argument, let us consider
a concrete example. Assume as the two signalling speeds c and ¯c the speed of
sound and the speed of light, respectively. Let us further assume that there exist
intelligent beings — let us call them “soundlanders” — capable of developing
physics in their “ether”-medium [Svo83, Shu85, Svo86a, Svo86b, Cas, G¨un96].
For them, sound would appear as a perfectly appropriate phenomenon to base
their coordinate frames upon. What if they discover sonoluminiscence; i.e.,
creation of signals at supersonar speeds ¯c? Surely, because of the conceivable
paradoxes discussed before, this would result in a denial of the experimental
ﬁndings at ﬁrst and in a crisis of (theoretical sound) physics later. Fig. 3
depicts the construction of a quasi-time paradox, as perceived from the inertial
frame Σ generated by sound and the inertial frame ¯Σ generated by light.

As can be expected, when viewed from ¯Σ, the seemingly “paradoxical” pro-
cess perceived by Σ is not paradoxical at all. It appears that one resolution of
the paradoxes is to change the level of observation and take the perspective that
the “true physics” is not based upon sound but on electromagnetic phenomena.
After all, sound waves result from the coordinated motion of aggregates of atoms
or molecules, which in turn is dominated by the electromagnetic forces. In this
extrinsic view, the “sound physics” of the “soundlanders” is a representation of
the phenomena at an intermediate level of description [And72, Sch93]. Since
from that viewpoint, the appropriate signalling speed is electromagnetic radia-
tion at velocity ¯c, paradoxes disappear. Thus any attempt to construct paradoxa
at the intermediate level of sound signals is doomed to fail because that level of
description turns out to be inappropriate for the particular purpose.

This extrinsic viewpoint is juxtaposed by the intrinsic viewpoint [Bos55,
Tof78, Svo83, Svo86a, Svo86b, R¨os87, R¨os92, Svo93] of the “soundlanders” pre-
tending to maintain their intermediate level of “sound physics.” For them,
paradoxes are not realizable because certain procedures or actions are not oper-
ational. This amounts to the resolution of time paradoxa by the abandonment
of free will, at least for certain choices involved. That is to say, subjectively the
“soundlanders” appear to have free will, but this is only an idealistic illusion
[G¨od49a, G¨od49b, G¨od90a, Per86, Svo95].

As speculative as these considerations may be, they ﬁt in the resolution of
time paradoxes by Recami [Rec86, Rec87], as well as with the impossibility to

control single bit events in EPR-type experiments [Svo95]. What may appear
undecidable and uncontrollable to an intrinsic observer bound by incomplete
knowledge may be perfectly controllable and decidable with respect to a more
complete theory.

In general, one concept which proves useful for a discussion of the resulting
intrinsic quasi-paradoxa is the overall consistency of the phenomena. Too pow-
erful agents would become inconsistent. As a consequence, the predictive power
as well as the physical operationalizability (command over the phenomena) is
limited by the consistency requirement.

It should therefore be kept in mind that diﬀerent signalling speeds, in par-
ticular also superluminal signalling, can well be accommodated for within a
generalized theory of relativity. They do not necessarily mean inconsistencies
but just refer to diﬀerent levels of physical descriptions and conventions which
have to be careful accounted for.

The International System (SI) of units assumes light to be constant. It
was decided in 1983 by the General Conference on Weights and Mea-
sures that the accepted value for the speed of light would be exactly
299,792,458 meters per second. (The meter is now thus deﬁned as the
distance traveled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 second, inde-
pendent of the inertial system.).

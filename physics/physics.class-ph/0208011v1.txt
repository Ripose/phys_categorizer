ABSTRACT–Whereas Cantor multilayers made of an isotropic dielectric–magnetic mate-

rial with positive refractive index will show power–law characteristics, low–order Cantor

multilayers made of materials with negative refractive index will not exhibit the power–

law nature. A reason for this anomalous behavior is presented.

Key words: Cantor multilayers; ﬁlters, fractals, left–handed materials, negative index

of refraction, negative phase velocity

Introduction

This letter addresses the incorporation of isotropic materials with negative refractive

index [1], [2] in fractal ﬁlters inspired by Cantor dusts [3], [4].

The emergence of Cantor dusts, bars and cakes during the late 19th century has

been described at some length by Mandelbrot [3]. Brieﬂy, the simplest Cantor dust

is formed by dividing the closed interval [0, 1] into 3 pieces and removing the center

open piece (1/3, 2/3), repeating the trifurcation–and–removal process on the remaining

intervals [0, 1/3] and [2/3, 1], and continuing in that fashion ad inﬁnitum. The fractal

in p–dimensional space, (p = 1, 2, ...), can be constructed via spatial convolution [4]. In

particular, the constructs called Cantor bars appear to have captured the imagination of

optical–ﬁlter researchers, as recounted recently by Lehman [5], because of their putatively

self–similar response properties in the frequency domain [6].

The materials of choice for optical Cantor ﬁlters are isotropic dielectric with relative

permittivity ǫr. Although ǫr is a complex–valued function of frequency, the usual practice

in optics is to ignore dissipation by setting Im [ǫr] = 0. In the area of fractal optics, with

emphasis still on understanding basic interactions in nonperiodic multilayers, dispersion

is also ignored [5]–[8]. The structural self–similarity of the Cantor bars is then expected to

result in the self–similarity of the spectral reﬂectance/transmittance responses of optical

Cantor ﬁlters to normally incident light [6]. Truly, physically realizable Cantor ﬁlters

are not actually fractal but pre–fractal instead [9] — so that the spectral self–similarity

can only be approximate [10].

On examining the available literature, two questions arise. First, will the situation

change for Cantor ﬁlters made of isotropic dielectric–magnetic materials (with relative

permeability denoted by µr > 1)? Second, will the situation change if both ǫr < 0 and

µr < 0?

The second question arose because of the supposed veriﬁcation of the existence of

negative refractive index (NRI) by Shelby et al. [1] last year. Experiments performed on

certain composite materials with oriented microstructure suggested that these materials

are endowed with negligible dissipation as well as NRI in some appreciably wide fre-

quency band in the centimeter–wave regime. Also called left–handed materials by some

researchers (despite possessing no handedness), in NRI materials the phase velocity is

pointed opposite to the direction of energy ﬂow (and attenuation) [2], [11]. Although

the extant experimental results are not perfect [12], [13], the essential conclusion of the

existence of NRIs appears undeniable. As NRIs can potentially lead to exciting new

technologies [14], theoretical consideration is warranted.

In this letter, we answer the two questions posed earlier in a uniﬁed way. Section 2

is devoted to the theory of reﬂection and transmission of normally incident plane waves

by Cantor multilayers. Numerical results are presented and discussed in Section 3.

2 Theory

A Cantor multilayer is constructed sequentially as follows: Take a layer of thickness ℓ0

made of a certain material with ǫr and µr as its constitutive parameters. Call this layer

a multilayer of order N = 0. Next, cascade two multilayers of order N = 0 inserting a

space of thickness ℓ0/f , f

1, in between. Call this a multilayer of order N = 1. Its total

≥

thickness ℓ1 = (2 + 1/f )ℓ0. Continue in this manner. Thus, a multilayer of order N + 1 is

formed by inserting a space of thickness ℓN /f between two multilayers of order N . The

thickness of a multilayer of order N + 1 is then ℓN +1 = (2 + 1/f )ℓN = (2 + 1/f )N +1ℓ0.

The fractal dimension of the multilayer is given by

3 Numerical results and discussion

Following normal practice, we implemented the foregoing equations to compute ρN and

τN for non–dissipative and non–dispersive materials. We varied the quantity ζ = k0ℓ0

for various values of N , while keeping ǫr and µr ﬁxed.

The spectrums of

literature [5], [6] for optical Cantor ﬁlters (i.e., with ǫr > 1 and µr = 1). Those for

turned to be qualitatively similar, and therefore

As ζ increases from zero, the fundamental layer thickness ℓ0 becomes an increas-

ingly signiﬁcant fraction of the wavelength λ0 = 2π/k0, and eventually surpasses λ0. In

other words, layers are electrically thin for small ζ, and an increase in ζ amounts to

magniﬁcation. Therefore we evaluated the value ˜ζN of ζ at which the ﬁrst minimum
occurs as ζ increases from zero, thereby reckoning ˜ζN as a reasonable parameter

similarity of Cantor multilayers would result in their spectral self–similarity, we expect

the relationship

to emerge from our numerical investigations.

B. The data for Cantor multilayers with NRI materials indicates two diﬀerent regimes,

one for small N and the other for large N , the second regime characterized by a

power law.

The foregoing conclusions suggest that the eﬀect of NRI materials on electromagnetic

ﬁelds must be substantively diﬀerent from that of PRI materials, for the anomalous ﬁrst

regime to arise for Cantor multilayers with NRI materials. Furthermore, in the present

context, the diﬀerence must be evident deﬁnitely for order N = 0.

Hence, we analyzed the planewave response of a single layer to obtain

In light of the relationship (10), let us compare a PRI layer and a NRI layer —

labeled a and b, respectively — such that µra =

wavenumber k0 is ﬁxed. If the thicknesses of the two layers are such that the sum βa +

ǫrb > 0, while the

is an integral multiple of 2π, then (8) and (9) yield ρ0a = ρ0b and τ0a = τ0b. Thus, a PRI

µrb > 0 and ǫra =

layer of a certain thickness is equivalent to a NRI layer of diﬀerent thickness, in terms of

the complex–valued reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients at a ﬁxed wavelength. But

the thickness of the equivalent NRI layer is wavelength–dependent — which implies that

a PRI Cantor multilayer is equivalent at diﬀerent wavelengths to diﬀerent NRI Cantor

multilayers. Not surprisingly therefore, the spectral characteristics of a PRI and a NRI

Cantor multilayers with the same ℓ0 are not isomorphic.

The diﬀerence is very noticeable for small N in Figures 1 and 2. As N increases,

the value of ˜ζN decreases for both PRI and NRI multilayers — in other words, the

fundamental layer of thickness ℓ0 becomes electrically thinner at the ﬁrst transmittance

minimum and, therefore, a weaker reﬂector as well as a stronger transmitter. Structural

characteristics then dominate over the consequences of (10), because

ρ0| ≃
|

0 and

τ0| ≃
|

1.

As the diﬀerence between PRI and NRI multilayers lessens with increasing N , the latter

also begin to evince power–law characteristics.

The crossover between the anomalous and the power–law regimes for NRI multilayers

takes place at a higher value of N as f increases. This general trend is indicated by

Figures 1 and 2 as well as calculations for other values of f .

To conclude, we have shown that the planewave reﬂection and transmission spec-

trums of a Cantor multilayer made of an isotropic dielectric–magnetic material with

positive refractive index shows power–law characteristics which indicate spectral self–

similarity. However, if the same multilayer were to be made of a material with negative

7

refractive index, then the power–law nature is not going to be evident when the interac-

tion between the material layers and the interleaving vacuous spaces is substantial (the

small–N regime). The existence of this anomalous regime can be attributed to the re-

ﬂection/transmission phase reversal of a NRI layer in relation to its PRI analog. If that

interaction is insubstantial (the large–N regime), the structural features would dominate

the constitutive features, and the power–law characteristics would be evident also for the

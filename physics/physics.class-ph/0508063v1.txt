Abstract

The problem of statistical description of classical matter, represented by a N-body
system of relativistic point particles falling into a black hole, is investigated, adopt-
ing a classical framework. A covariant microscopic statistical description is devel-
oped for the classical particle system by introducing the deﬁnition of observer-
related N-particle microscopic distribution function and by suitably extending to
general relativity the concept of Gibbs microscopic entropy. The corresponding en-
tropy production rate is calculated taking into account the presence of an event
horizon and proven to obey, for N >> 1, an exact microscopic H-theorem which
holds for arbitrary geometries.

Key words:
Relativistic statistical mechanics, Classical black holes, Boltzmann and Gibbs
entropy, Black hole thermodynamics.

1 Introduction

Since its inception [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] the thermodynamical interpretation of black
holes (BH) has been the subject of debate [6]. Indeed, the mathematical anal-
ogy between the laws of thermodynamics and black hole physics following
from classical general relativity still escapes a complete and satisfactory in-
terpretation. In particular it is not yet clear whether this analogy is merely

formal or leads to an actual identiﬁcation of physical quantities belonging to
apparently unrelated frameworks. The diﬃculty is related to the very concept
of entropy usually adopted in BH theory, based on Boltzmann entropy, which
is determined by the number W of microscopic complexions compatible with
the macroscopic state of a physical system

Sbh = K ln W.

Indeed Sbh does not rely on a true statistical description of physical systems,
but only on the classiﬁcation of the microstates of the system, quantal or
classical. As a consequence, the evaluation of Sbh requires the knowledge of
the internal structure of the BH, a result which obviously cannot be achieved
in the context of a purely classical description of BH. Therefore the evaluation
of Sbh requires a consistent formulation of quantum theory of gravitation and
matter [3, 5]. This can be based, for example, on string theory [7] and can be
conveniently tested in the framework of semiclassical gravity [8, 9].

A basic diﬃculty of quantum theories founded on the concept of Boltzmann
entropy, is that up not now they have not leaved up to their expectations since
they have not yet achieved their primary goal, i.e., the rigorous proof of an
H-theorem and the full consistency with the second law of thermodynamics
δSbh ≥
0. Indeed, estimates of the Boltzmann entropy based quantum theory
4k c3A
of gravitation [3, 5] and yielding Sbh ≡
G~ , being A the area of the event
horizon, are inconsistent from this viewpoint, since as a consequence of the
BH radiation eﬀect [4] the radius of the BH may actually decrease. Hence, the
Boltzmann entropy Sbh cannot be interpreted, in a proper sense, as a physical
entropy of the BH. To resolve this diﬃculty a modiﬁed constitutive equation
for the entropy was postulated [1, 2], in order to include the contribution of
the matter in the BH exterior, by setting

1

S′ = S + Sbh,

(1)

(S′ denoting the so-called Bekenstein entropy) where S represents the cor-
rection carried by the matter outside the BH (notice, however, that also S
cannot be interpreted as entropy). As a consequence a generalized second law
δS′
0 was proposed [1, 2] which can be viewed as nothing more than the
ordinary second law of thermodynamics applied to a system containing a BH.
However, the precise deﬁnition and underlying statistical basis both for S and
potentially also of Sbh remain obscure. Thus a fundamental problem appears
their precise estimates based on suitable microscopic models.

≥

On the other hand, if one regards the BH as a classical object in the space-
time continuum, provided the surrounding falling matter can be assumed as
formed by a suitably large number of particles, the estimate of the BH entropy
should be achievable directly in the context of classical statistical mechanics,
by adopting the customary concept of statistical entropy, i.e., Gibbs entropy.

2

In contrast to the Boltzmann entropy, this is based on a statistical description
of physical systems and is deﬁned in terms of the probability distribution of
the observable microstates of the system. In fact, as is well-known, its deﬁni-
tion coincides with the axiomatic deﬁnition of Shannon entropy, yielding the
measure of ignorance on statistical ensembles. A ﬁrst result of this type been
presented in previous work by Nicolini and Tessarotto [10] (hereon denoted as
Ref.I), where a covariant kinetic theory in the presence of an event horizon was
developed for classical matter in the BH exterior, treated as a N-body system
(with N
1) of classical point particles undergoing, before capture, a purely
Hamiltonian dynamics. By introducing a suitable deﬁnition for the relativistic
kinetic entropy of infalling classical matter described as an ensemble of point
particles, an H-Theorem was reached, tanking into account the presence of the
black hole event horizon.

≫

The goal of the present paper is to extend the results of Ref.I by developing
a microscopic (N-body) statistical description of classical matter in the pres-
ence of an event horizon. For this purpose we intend to evaluate the Gibbs
(microscopic) entropy of classical matter falling into the BH event horizon. In
particular, we intend to prove the validity of an exact H-theorem holding for
Gibbs entropy, provided the infalling matter can be described as a suitably
large classical system (N
1) of point (neutral or charged) particles forming
plasma or a rareﬁed gas which interact mutually only via a mean Hamiltonian
ﬁeld.

≫

The scheme of the presentation is as follows. In Sec. II, ﬁrst the basic as-
sumptions of the theory are introduced, which include the concept of particle
capture domain, assumed to be deﬁned by a smooth hypersurface located
suitably close to the event horizon (capture surface). Second, a covariant mi-
croscopic statistical description is formulated for a N-body system of classical
point particles referred to an arbitrary observer. In particular, in the exterior
domain of the BH (outside the capture surface) the particle system is assumed
to obey a Hamiltonian dynamics. As a consequence, in the same domain the
Liouville theorem for the corresponding phase-ﬂow is readily recovered and,
based on the concept of observer-related N-particle microscopic distribution
function and probability density, the relativistic N-body Liouville equation
is determined. Finally suitable boundary conditions are introduced for the
microscopic distribution function on the capture surface.

In Sec. III the deﬁnitions of observer-related relativistic Gibbs and kinetic
entropies for the infalling classical matter are introduced and the correspond-
ing entropy production rates are determined. The relationship between the
two entropies is proven to hold in an elementary way for classical systems
of weakly interacting point particles. As a consequence the obvious physical
interpretation of the contributions of the entropy production rate are pointed
out.

3

Finally, in Sec. IV, an H-theorem is recovered for the Gibbs entropy, extending
the result of Ref.I. The result is proven to hold for BH characterized by an
event horizon of arbitrary shape and size. In particular, the result is proven
to apply, in contrast to Boltzmann entropy in quantum theory of gravitation
[5], also to the case of matter falling in a BH with contracting event horizons,
such as BH implosions or slow contractions.

2 The N-body covariant microscopic statistical description

In this section we introduce the basic framework of the theory. The assump-
tions we are going to make deal with the treatment of non-isolated black hole
formed by the collapse of a star and surrounded by matter. The BH, together
with its associated event horizon, and of the matter surrounding the BH and
falling toward the event horizon are all assumed as classical. It is suﬃcient for
our purposes to assume the following hypotheses:

I) Infalling particles capture is due to the redshift phenomenon occurring near
the event horizon for an arbitrary observer located far from the BH (for ex-
ample in a region where space time is asymptotically ﬂat [13]). As a result
particles suﬃciently close to the event horizon eﬀectively disappear to the ob-
server (Assumption 1). In the sequel we shall assume that all particle capture
events occurs in a subdomain, to be identiﬁed with a surface γ of the space-
time (capture surface), localized inﬁnitesimally close to the event horizon.

II) The total energy of infalling particles is ﬁnite in such a way that local
distortions of space-time are negligible (Assumption 2).

≫

The matter outside the BH is described by a system of N
1 identical
classical particles to be referred to an arbitrary observer O. If we assume that
the system is Hamiltonian, its evolution is well known and results uniquely
determined by the classical equations of motion, deﬁned with respect to the
observer O. To this purpose let us choose O, without loss of generality, in a
region where space time is (asymptotically) ﬂat, endowing it with the proper
R (observer’s time axis).
time τ , where τ is assumed to span the set I
Without loss of generality we can assume that the particles are points, i.e., they
are described by the 1-particle canonical states xi (with i = 1, N) spanning the
i , piµ). The analogous treatment
8
−
of particles having higher degree of freedom is straightforward. Therefore, the
evolution of the system, described in terms of the N-body canonical state x
≡
, is determined by a suitable relativistic Hamiltonian H = H (x),
x1, ..., xN }
{
where each canonical 1-particle state xi (i = 1, N) results parameterized in
terms of the i
th particle world line arc length si (see [12]). As a consequence,
requiring that si = si(τ ) results a strictly monotonic function it follows that,

The event horizon of a classical BH is deﬁned by the hypersurface rH,identical
for all particles and speciﬁed by the equation

where for m = 1, N, Rm denotes the a suitable curvilinear coordinate for
the m-th particle and coincides with the radial coordinate in the spherically

where rǫ = (1 + ǫ)rH , while ǫ > 0 is an inﬁnitesimal which may depend on ex-
plicit or hidden parameters (for example, ǫ might depend on the detector used
by the observer). The presence of the BH event horizon is taken into account
by deﬁning suitable boundary conditions for the kinetic distribution function
on the hypersurface γ. For this purpose we distinguish between incoming and
outgoing distributions on γ with respect to the i-th particle, ρ(N )(+,i)

As previously anticipated, these boundary conditions do not actually require
the detailed physical model for the particle loss mechanism, since all particles
are assumed to be captured on the same hyper-surface γ, independent of their
state. This provides a classical loss model for the BH event horizon.

3 Covariant Liouville equation

It is now immediate to determine the covariant Liouville equation which in
the external domains, i.e. outside the event horizon, advances in time the
microscopic distribution function ρ(N )
G (x) with respect to the observer O.
Thanks to Liouville theorem (i.e., phase-space volume conservation in ΓN in
the sense indicated above) and invoking as usual the axiom of conservation
ρ(N )(x) must satisﬁes the
of probability for classical systems, it follows that

tivistic phase space in the domain external to the event horizon. Invoking the
Hamiltonian dynamics (2), the kinetic equation takes the conservative form

Let us now introduce the assumption, holding for collisionless of weakly inter-
acting particles, either neutral or charged, that the Hamiltonian H (x) can be
expressed in the form

where Hi = Hi (xi) . This implies that the particles of the N-body system

4 Observer-related relativistic Gibbs and kinetic entropy

Let us now introduce the deﬁnition for the microscopic entropy S(ρ(N )) appro-
priate in the context of the present covariant theory. The deﬁnition follows by
straightforward generalization of the relativistic kinetic entropy [10] and the
concept of Gibbs entropy in non-relativistic [14, 15] and relativistic [16, 17, 18]
statistical mechanics. Thus the concept of Gibbs microscopic entropy can be

Moreover, we notice that the support of the kinetic distribution function, i.e.,

sumption 2 here considered, implying that the energy of the falling particles
reaching the surface γ cannot become inﬁnite.

Therefore, denoting Ω the subset of Γ− in which the kinetic distribution func-
tion ˆρ(1) is non-zero, in the complementary set Γ−

tion function ρ(1) = Np(1) (being p(1) the kinetic probability density) results
identically zero. Thanks to Assumption 2, it follows that such a set results

even in the presence of a contracting event horizon (which might by produced,
for example, by star implosions). The present theory appear therefore poten-
tially relevant for a realistic detailed analysis of the BH thermodynamical
properties.

6 Conclusions

In this paper a macroscopic statistical description has been adopted for clas-
sical matter around black holes. Matter in the immediate vicinities of a BH
event horizon has been modelled by a weakly interacting relativistic gas SN .
Its dynamics results described by the relativistic Lioville equation, while the
presence of the BH event horizon is taken into account by treating it as a
classical absorbing porous wall.

By assuming that Hamiltonian dynamics takes into account only mean ﬁeld
interactions between particles, the connection with the kinetic treatment of
Ref.I can be immediately established. As a consequence, an H-theorem valid
for the Liouville equation can be established on rigorous grounds which applies
to every space time geometry and to the case of contracting horizon.

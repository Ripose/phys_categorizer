Do we need to recourse to Amp`ere-Neumann electrodynamics to
explain wire fragmentation in the solid state?

Abstract

Exploding wires are widely used in many experimental setups and pulsed power
systems. However, many aspects of the process of wire fragmentation still remain
unclear.
If the current density is not too high, the wire may break up in the solid
state. The experiments have shown that the wires break in tension due to longitudinal
forces of unknown nature.

In a series of papers, see [2, 3, 4, 5] Graneau argued that neither mechanical vi-
brations induced by the electromagnetic pinch force nor thermal expansion could have
been responsible for the wire disintegration because they were too weak. To explain
the phenomenon he appealed to the obsolete Amp`ere force law as opposed to the con-
ventional Biot-Savart force law. Graneau argued that the Amp`ere force law would
lead to a longitudinal tension in the wire, although his calculations may have been
in error on this point. Therefore, Graneau’s explanations induced a controversy in
electrodynamics with a number of authors arguing pro and con.

Previous theoretical and numerical investigations served to provide a search for
these forces without recourse to unconventional electrodynamics have identiﬁed the
pinch eﬀect and thermal expansion as a source of strong longitudinal vibrations. But
the tensile stress component has been proved to be present only in the wires having free
ends. Thus the mechanism doesn’t give a satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon
in the wires with clumped ends. In this investigation, we use a simpliﬁed magneto-
thermo-elastic model to study ﬂexural vibrations induced by high pulsed currents in
wires with clumped ends on account of their role in the disintegration process. Several
aspects are studied, namely (i) the buckling instability due to simultaneous action of
the thermal expansion and the magnetic force, (ii) the ﬂexural vibrations induced in
initially bent wires. It is shown that the induced ﬂexural vibrations are strong enough
to lead to the breaking of the wire in a wide range of parameters.

1 Introduction

The phenomenon of wire fragmentation in the solid state by high pulsed currents was studied

experimentally by Nasilowski [1], and Graneau [2, 3, 4]. They observed that a suﬃciently

strong electric current would shatter a thin metal wire under a broad range of conditions

(various wire material and geometry, diﬀerent current types, etc.). As a result of the explo-

sion the wires fragmented into 2-100 pieces with apparent signs of longitudinal tensile stress.

1

The experimental results, as well as (sometimes controversial) early attempts to explain the

phenomenon have been reviewed by Graneau [5] , Hong [6] and Molokov&Allen [7].

It is obvious that an electric current passing through a metal wire induces stress waves.

Their origins are in (i) the thermal expansion owing to the volumetric Joule heating, and (ii)

the Lorentz-, or pinch-, force. These forces depend on the magnitude and the rate of change

of the current passing through the wire. They grow as either of these parameters increases.

Ternan [8] suggested that in Graneau’s experiments with wires with free ends standing

stress waves may be induced as a result of thermal expansion. Using a simple one-dimensional

model he showed that the resulting stresses were suﬃcient to lead to a fracture.

This mechanism of fragmentation of wires with free ends has been explored in more detail

by Molokov&Allen in [7]. They employed a magneto-thermo-elastic model of the stress-wave

propagation, and solved the problem numerically on assumption of axisymmetric nature

of vibrations . Their conclusion was that the characteristic value of both compressive and

tensile longitudinal stresses obtained for the aluminium wire with radius a = 0.6 mm carrying

current I = 5 kA and having free ends (the parameters relevant to the experiment in [3])

would be about 33 MPa per unit length of the wire. The stress has been shown to grow

linearly with the wire length and thus, for suﬃciently long wires, the resultant stress exceeds

the ultimate strength of aluminium. This is 75 MPa at 100◦ C going down to 17 MPa at

320◦ C [9].

Although the mechanism does give large value of tensile stresses, it cannot explain the

fragmentation of wires with clamped ends (as in the experiments [1, 4]) because within the

axisymmetric model in this case the stresses can be only compressive [7]. It is clear, however,

that in the wires with clamped ends ﬂexural vibrations may be induced. The apparent signs

of these modes have been observed in the Graneau’s experiments on the wires with ﬁrmly

clamped ends. The resultant wire shape, after breaking, clearly indicated on that, see

photographs in [4].

In this paper we carry out a special study of ﬂexural vibrations to account for their role

in fragmentation of wires with clamped ends. In section 2, we present the formulation of

2

the problem and discuss simpliﬁcations of the model. In section 3, the linear stability of the

system is considered. In section 4, we carry out a qualitative analysis of expected stresses.

In section 5, numerical algorithm and results are presented.

2 Formulation

Consider a wire which is ﬁrmly clamped between two points located along the z-axis. Let the

distance between these points be L. We restrict our attention to the case of plane motion,

and denote the deﬂection of the wire from the axis by X which is a function of z and time

t. The deﬂection of the wire in the initial undeformed state is denoted by X0. Possible

three-dimensional modes, not considered here, may only increase stresses, especially at the

clamped ends.

Our theoretical consideration is based on a simpliﬁed model valid for suﬃciently long or

suﬃciently thin wires. In this model the deﬂection X of the wire is assumed to be much

lower than the wire length, i.e. |X|/L ≪ 1. Since large deﬂections of the order of the wire

length are not expected in the wire explosion experiments, this restriction is not expected to

be very stringent. Another small parameter used in the model is the ratio a/L << 1, where

a is the wire radius. This condition is usually well satisﬁed. Plastic deformations are not

considered here although they may be important in the vicinity of the melting point. Thus

all deformations are assumed to be elastic.

Then the deﬂection X obeys the following equation ([10]):

∂2X0

∂2X
∂z2 − Fx −

(1)

where ρ is the material density, S is the wire cross-section which may be a function of z,

J is the eﬀective moment of inertia of the wire cross-section (for a circular cross-section
J = πa4/4, where a is the wire radius), E is the Young modulus, G is the force along the z

axis applied at the wire ends, Fx is the distributed external force per unit length along the

x direction and Cy is the distributed moment of force along the y direction per unit length.

For the physical situation considered here, the force G can be represented as

3

G = ES{(˜l − ˜l0)/L − α[T (t) − T0]},

The second term is a compressive force due to the thermal expansion, α being the linear ex-

pansion coeﬃcient. The ﬁrst, nonlinear term is a retarding force due to the wire deformation

from the initial state, where

is the increment of the wire length due to the deﬂection. When X = X0, ˜l = ˜l0 and the

retarding force equals to zero, as required.

The boundary conditions are those for the clamped ends, namely

X =

at z = 0 and z = L.

The initial conditions are

2.1 The magnetic force

In long, thin wires under consideration a/L << 1, uniform current is directed perpendicular

to the cross-section. Thus any possible forces of magnetic nature act only in the cross-section

plane. These forces create no moment and thus Cy = 0 in our case.

The net distributed force F can be calculated directly from

F =

j × B dS.

The integral in (5) is taken over the wire cross-section area. The magnetic ﬁeld is given by

To calculate the x component of the force, Fx, one can split the integral (6) over the wire

into two parts B = Bin + Bex. The ﬁrst part of the integral Bin is taken over the

range |z

− z| < ∆, where a << ∆ << ξL, ξL being the characteristic length scale of the

function X(z). The second part Bex is taken over the rest of the wire length ∆ < |z

−z| < L,

′

whereby the volume integral reduces to the integration over the wire length only. That is,

Bex =

where I is the total current. The ﬁrst integral can be evaluated in general with the assump-

tion of a uniform current distribution and in the approximation a << ξL, |X|/ξL << 1. The

ﬁrst inequality has been implicitly introduced in fact when we set the length ∆, the second

inequality just represents the fact that the wire is slightly deﬂected from a straight line. The

ﬁrst integration asymptotically gives the expression for the net force as follows

That is the force is proportional to the local wire curvature [11]. The second part cannot be

integrated in a general case and one needs to make certain assumptions about the wire form

and thus about the function X(z) itself. In the case of an inﬁnitely long wire with periodic

lateral perturbations X =

(8)

(9)

Note, that the expression (9) is identical to the formula obtained in [12] in a particular case

of small periodic deﬂections |X| << a.

It is clear that the assumption of an inﬁnitely long wire to calculate the force, Fx, is not

very rigorous, since in experiments the circuit is always closed. This implies that in addition

to the magnetic force by the wire current itself, there may be a component generated by

the currents ﬂowing in the external circuit. This eﬀect can be taken into consideration by

substituting an appropriate circuit form, in other words the function X(z) in the second

integral.

5

Alternatively, this force can be obtained by means of the virtual work principle. To

estimate how strong the eﬀect could be, we will use a general expression for the inductance

of a closed circuit Λ =

µ0
2π Ls ln(Ls/as), where Ls is the circuit characteristic length and as is
the radius of the circuit wire, see [13]. Then varying the circuit length Ls one can calculate
the subsequent variation of the associated magnetic energy Em = 1
2 ΛI 2. Then, equalising

the net force acting on the circuit FN with the variation of the energy we get

FN δLs =

I 2(ln(Ls/as) + 1)δLs.

µ0
4π

(10)

from (10) we get f ≃ µ

An average force acting on a unit length is f = FN /L. Then, for the average force
4π 0I 2(ln(Ls/as) + 1)/Ls. The ﬁrst, logarithmic part of the net force
represents contribution from the end eﬀects, see (7). The second part gives the integrated

force from the circuit as a whole. If L << Ls, one can assume that the force is constant

throughout the wire length in the ﬁrst approximation. Then, this ”constant” force acting on

a wire of length L will create longitudinal stress σk =

, see the problem

in [10] on page 93. For a copper wire with L = 30 cm, a = 0.6 mm and the circuit with

µ2

E(πa2)4

L6
L2
s

I = 5 kA, Ls = 20 m and as = 1 cm the stress is amounting to σk ≃ 8.4 MPa. This is only

an estimation, and the eﬀect needs special analysis since the geometry of external circuits is

usually unknown. Moreover, using a symmetrical circuit with two loops from both sides of

the wire one can completely compensate the external magnetic force.

We leave this question for further detailed investigation and neglect the contribution from

the external circuit in our analysis. Further we will use formula (9).

2.2 The temperature behaviour

The temperature behaviour with time is governed by the passing current. It can be calculated

according to the direct Joule heating of the wire material from

ρcv

(11)

neglecting by the process of thermal conductivity. This assumption would hold for thermally

isolated wires with uniform current distribution. In expression (11), j is the current density,

ρ and σ are the density and the electrical conductivity of the metal, cv is the speciﬁc heat.

From the above equation using the well-known inverse dependence of the conductivity on

temperature σ = σ0

3 Linear stability

To investigate possible instabilities in the system, we ﬁrst carry out a linear stability analysis

assuming for a moment that all the parameters, such as current and wire temperature, are

constants independent of time. Even though, in a real situation, they vary quite fast with

time and numerical methods must be involved to solve the system, our simpliﬁed analysis

will form a basis for qualitative interpretation and understanding of the results.

3.1 Stability of an initially straight wire

Consider an initially straight wire by letting X0 = 0. General analysis of the system (1)

shows that two basic types of buckling instabilities may develop. They are due to thermal

expansion, expressed by the force G applied at the wire ends [10], and the magneto-elastic

buckling instability [14] expressed by force Fx. In both cases, the instability has a threshold

character. When either the force G or the current I exceed some critical value, new stable

states appear. The initially stable state X = 0 then becomes unstable and buckling occurs.

We are looking for non-trivial stationary solutions of the linearized system (1), (3), (4).

They are given by the equation

Here, the temperature, T , and the total current, I, are assumed to be independent of time,

and so are the functions G = −αES[T − T0] and Fx = −

To obtain a solution to (12) it is convinient to use a complete set of orthogonal functions

This set of functions is commonly used in the theory of stability and buckling of elastic

columns [15].

The eigenvalues of the boundary-value problem (14) satisfy the dispersion equation

So, one can see that the set of functions consists of two subsets. The ﬁrst subset is deﬁned

by the eigenvalues given by

That is

cos(λiL) = 1
sin(λiL) = 0.

λi = π · (i + 1)/L, i = 1, 3, 5 . . . .

In this case the associated eigenfunctions are given by

And the second subset is deﬁned by

Xi = cos(λiz) − 1.

The associated eigenfunctions are given by

Xi = cos(λiz) − 1 + 2z −

λiL

The ﬁrst eigenvalue of this subset is equal to λ2 = 8.986819/L. Further eigenvalues are

approximately given by λi ≃ π · (i + 1)/L, i = 4, 6, 8 . . ..

Now, with the help of (15) one can obtain from (12) a criterion when the instability ﬁrst

appears

α(T − T0)ES −

(21)

4π

The ﬁrst term on the left hand side of (21) is responsible for the thermal expansion eﬀect,

while the second term represents magneto-elastic buckling. It should be noted that while

we are considering both eﬀects simultaneously, for parameters relevant to wire explosion

experiments these terms have diﬀerent orders of magnitude.

The criterion obtained shows when the ﬁrst eigenmode of (1) and the system as a whole

become unstable, λ1 = 2π/L being the corresponding eigenvalue.

In a similar manner,

substituting other eigenvalues λi for λ1, one can obtain respective criteria for higher modes

as well.

The set (14) being very usefull in the linear stability analysis of system (1) doesn’t seem

to be very relevant to study the increments of the instability since

But, it would be interesting to obtain an estimate of the increments of the instability. For

this purpose, we will substitute a solution to (1) in the form X = Ai(t)Xi, i.e assuming that

only one mode is present. Then, for the increment γi, (Ai(t) ∼ exp(γit)), one gets

As we will see further, for the range of parameters used in the wire explosion experiments,

the contribution from the terms due to magnetic force can be neglected during the initial
stage and within this approximation, using explicitly J = πa4/4 and S = πa2,

On the other hand, the maximal λlim at which instability may exist is obtained from (23)

with the same accuracy. From (27), since λi ≃ π · (i + 1)/L, one gets for the maximal mode

Thus the dominant mode lies somewhere between the ﬁrst unstable mode and the last one

with the maximal increment

From the expression (26) one can see that higher modes are likely to become dominant

in the instability spectrum with increase in the wire length. As a result, the wire shape can

take a rather intricate form. It seems that the instability on higher modes has been observed

experimentally by Graneau, [4]. At the experimental conditions he used, i.e. aluminium

wire, L = 1 m, a = 0.6 mm, from (25) one gets λext ≃ 294 or the corresponding mode

number iext = 93 at T = Tmelt. The photographs of the wire shape after the current had

been switched oﬀ showed clearly the appearance of at least 5 bulges on a small part of the

wire.

We will refer further to the sets of parameters presented in Table I corresponding to

diﬀerent wire lengths and diﬀerent currents. One should note that two sets, [B] and [E], are

For all the represented sets, the criterion (21) is fulﬁlled well enough. Indeed, we have

put in the Table I the corresponding values of the terms in (21), designating them as P1,

P2 and P3 from left to right. The estimations have been done at T = Tmelt, Tmelt being

the melting temperature; Tmelt = 660◦ C for aluminium and Tmelt = 1085◦ C for copper.

The characteristic increment (29) at the same conditions, in the case [B] for instance, is
γmax ≃ 105 sec−1, which is much greater than the temperature increment γT ≃ 7 × 102 sec−1.

Thus, even though the estimation has been done in the linear approximation, it is clear that

the instability has suﬃcient time to develop before the wire reaches the melting point.

In all the cases, as is seen, the major contribution is from the thermal expansion eﬀect,

while the inﬂuence of the magnetic-force terms can be neglected during the initial stage (this,

of course, can be estimated directly from (1) as well). Two terms, P1 and P2, for instance

in case [B], become equal only at T − T0 = 6.6◦ C. The time it takes for the temperature to

be driven through this range is ∆t ≃ 30 µsec. The characteristic time for the instability to
develop for this temperature diﬀerence is much longer, γ−1

max = 800 µsec.

3.2 Stability of an initially bent wire

Consider a wire which has an initial form X0 =
set (14) and A0

P

i are given weight coeﬃcients. One needs to stress, that with the accuracy

i A0

i Xi, where the functions {Xi} is the

the system (1) was derived, |X0| > a must always be the case. Performing analysis similar

11

to that leading to equation (21) and neglecting the magnetic force for the sake of simplicity,

for a mode k one gets

k(Ak − A0
λ2

k)EJ − AkES(α∆T ) = 0.

(30)

From (30) one can see that there is always a stationary state which diﬀers from X0 at any
nonzero value of the parameter α∆T . Thus, those modes which have A0

k 6= 0 are always

unstable. The result is not surprising, since from the physical point of view it is obvious

that a constantly heated wire will change its form owing to expansion. On the other hand,
those modes which have A0

k = 0 become unstable at some value of the parameter α∆T , so

that buckling instability is still possible on these modes.

4 Qualitative stress analysis.

Once the instability occurs, all the potential energy comprised into the compressed wire can

be quickly released. The characteristic value of the longitudinal stress τzz which may be

accumulated during the preconditioning is within the interval between the maximum value
zz = α(Tmelt − T0)E ∼ 103 MPa and the minimum value τ min
τ max

0 ≃ 0.3 ÷ 30 MPa

zz = E J

S λ2

corresponding to the onset of the instability. The estimation has been done for an aluminium

wire of radius a = 0.6 mm and the length spanning the range 1 m > L > 0.05 m.

One can see, that the maximum value itself is very high, about 10 times higher than the

ultimate strength value. On the other hand, the minimum value can be quite small depending
on the wire length. The average transverse stress is given by < τxx >= G

− E J

. For

′′′

′

small deﬂections, |X|/ξL ≪ 1, it is in general smaller then the longitudinal one.

From the qualitative point of view it is evident that the maximal stress energy can be

accumulated if the temperature rises suﬃciently quickly. The temperature rise time must be

shorter or comparable with the rise time of the instability. The most dramatic result might

be expected if the wire is heated up to the temperature just slightly below the melting point.

Then the current is switched oﬀ thus allowing the instability to develop without melting the

material. On the other hand, if the current is low and, as a consequence, the temperature

rise time is low too, then all the accumulated energy can be released at the onset of the

12

instability by the ﬁrst mode which is becoming ﬁrst unstable. This case corresponds to the

lower limit of the estimated stress value τ min

.

zz

Thus, already now, from the linear analysis, it is obvious that many scenarios of the

instability are possible. Dynamically, many modes can be excited simultaneously while

the temperature T increases from T0 up to the melting point Tmelt. Even though the ﬁrst

mode becomes ﬁrst unstable it might happen that further other modes play dominant role

creating rather complex dynamical behaviour. Any particular pattern, of course, depends on

temporal characteristics such as the ratio between instability increment and the temperature

rise time.

5 Numerical results

Now, there are several further questions. What character will the instability have on the

nonlinear stage? How high longitudinal and transverse stresses could be obtained in this

situation? To answer these questions we solve the nonlinear equation (1) numerically.

5.1 Numerical algorithm

The numerial method of the solution of equation (1) with the boundary conditions (3) is

based on the complete set of orthogonal functions (14).

By expanding any solution to (1) into the series of the functions {Xi}, i.e X =

the partial diﬀerential equation turns into a system of ODEs with respect to time. They are

5.2 Flexural vibrations of initially straight wires

In the case of initially straight wires the initial conditions are Ai(0) = 0. To excite the

instability one needs to seed some initial noise level. To simulate noise present an additional

δF0 = 4 × 10−4 newton. The function −1 < δf (t) < 1 has been calculated by means of a

random number generator at each step of calculations over time. This force can give rise

to deﬂection of an aluminium wire with L = 1 m and a = 0.6 mm from a straight line by

approximately X ∼ 0.1 a.

has

in

the

form

I(t) = I0 sinh(t/t0)/cosh(t/t0), where t0 is the current rise time. In all runs t0 = 30 µsec.

This time is about twice as high as the skin time for aluminium wires with a = 0.6 mm,
tskin = a2σµ0 ≃ 17 µsec. We also kept T0 = 300◦ K and calculations stopped once the tem-

perature had reached the melting point T = Tmelt. We designated this moment by t = te.

We have performed simulations for diﬀerent conditions: diﬀerent wire lengths, diﬀerent

currents and diﬀerent wire materials. All the sets used are presented in Table I.

As the ﬁrst example, let’s consider a short aluminium wire carrying 5 kA current, case

[A]. For these parameters from the linear analysis one would expect a few unstable modes to

develop, ilim = 6. The results obtained are presented in Fig.1. We have plotted in the ﬁrst
two frames the deﬂection X as a function of z and the spectrum < A(t)2

i > both taken at t =

te. In the last two frames, we have plotted the longitudinal τzz and transverse < τxx > stress

components as functions of time. The spectrum has been calculated by means of averaging

i dt, where ∆ is chosen to be greater

i >=

te

the form being close to a simple arc, Fig.1a, show that the ﬁrst mode dominates during the

nonlinear stage of the instability. Temporal behaviour of the longitudinal and transverse

stress components demonstrates developed nonlinear ﬂexural vibrations, Fig.1c and Fig.1d.

The appearance of the instability is clearly seen at t ≃ 900µsec in both ﬁgures. The observed

longitudinal stress has both compressive and tensile components. The instability appeared

14

after strong compression, the maximal compressive stress being 429 MPa. The maximal

tensile longitudinal stress is amounting to τzz ≃ 244 MPa. This value is well above the

ultimate stress value for aluminium. The observed transverse stress, as has been expected,

is lower then the longitudinal one, < τxx >≃ 55 MPa.

Let’s consider now a longer wire, case [B]. This case is relevant to the conditions of the

Graneau’s experiments [4]. One might expect, in accordence with our qualitative analysis,

more active modes in the instability spectrum to develop with respect to the previous case,

ilim = 129.

Indeed, from Fig.2a and Fig.2b one can observe that the spectrum becomes

very rich with the major contribution from mode n = 27 at the melting point. The tensile

longitudinal and transverse stresses are amounting to τzz = 122 MPa and < τxx >= 92 MPa

in this case, see Fig.2c and Fig.2d. Both of them are well above the ultimate strength

of aluminium. Thus, one might expect the ﬁrst wire break to appear just after buckling

occured, at t = 1000 µsec.

Let’s investigate now the eﬀect of variations of current. In case [C], which is a replica of

case [B] but with lower current, two modes n = 5 and n = 7 become dominant, Fig.3a. This

fact indicates, if we compare two spectra in cases [B] and [C], that the main channel of the

accumulated energy to release is going now through the modes with lower numbers. Thus,

one would anticipate a lower accumulated stress according to our qualitative stress analysis.

Indeed, we have observed that both tensile longitudinal and transverse stresses reduced to

τzz = 70 MPa and < τxx >= 23 MPa, Fig.3b and Fig.3c.

On the other hand, an increase of the current leads to higher resultant tensile stress

value.

In case [D] which is similar to set [B] but with a higher current, the longitudinal

tensile stress is τzz ≃ 233 MPa in maximum, Fig.4. It should be noted that because of faster

heating the preliminary compression before the instability developed is much more stronger,

namely 851 MPa, and the instability occurred just before the melting point. It appears that

at higher current the wire will be molten before the buckling occurs.

Let’s consider now the Nasilovski’s experiment with a long copper wire, case [E]. This

experiment has been carried out at quite a low current I = 500 A in comparison with the

15

all previously considered cases. As a result, one might expect low stress values compared to

previous cases. Also, a few ﬁrst modes must be dominant. Indeed, that is just the case, see

Fig.5a. The observed values of stress indeed become quite low. The longitudinal stress is

reaching τzz ≃ 27 MPa in maximum, Fig.5b, while the transverse stress is just about 4 MPa.

It means that the wire can be broken only if it was heated up enough.

5.3 Flexural vibrations of initially bent wires

In the above, we considered somewhat idealised situation, when the undeformed wire had the

shape of a straight rod. In reality, the wire might have had initially any form. For instance,

in the case of horizontal positioning of the wire it might be bent by gravitational force. Once

the initial dislocation becomes grater than the radius, the character of the instability changes

as has been discussed. Indeed, if X0 6= 0 the initial state is unstable from the beginning.

But, if the temperature risetime is shorter than the period of ﬂexural vibrations then those

modes which contribute into X0 =

i Xi can be excited directly. Moreover, buckling on

the other modes is still possible. To estimate the stresses developed simulations for case [B]
have been performed but with initial conditions given by X0 = A0

1 = 20a. That is,

1X1 with A0

P

the wire was initially shaped like the ﬁrst mode of the set (14). The choice of the amplitude
A0

1 follows from estimations for a horizontally positioned wire of this length. The wire in

this case has a form X0 =

, see the problem in [10] page 93, q being the wire

24EJ

weight per unit length. Thus, the maximal displacement is expected to be X0max ∼ 18a.

The results of simulations are shown in Fig.6. As before, one can see developed nonlinear

vibrations. The regular character of the vibrations points out to the fact that only one

single mode i = 1 is active in this case. This means that buckling on the other mode didn’t

occur. The amplitude of tensile longitudinal stress is amounting for this particular case to

τzz ≃ 50 MPa. So, a suﬃciently heated wire can be broken in this case as well.

Conclusions

When an electric current passes through a thin metal wire with clamped ends, ﬂexural elastic

stress waves are induced owing to the Joule heating and the electromagnetic force. The Joule

heating leads to thermal expansion of the wire material, which is the dominant mechanism

of the excitation of vibrations. Under realistic experimental conditions the electromagnetic

force is of minor importance.

Flexural vibrations in an initially straight wire may be excited as a result of the buckling

instability. The energy accumulated in the wire during the initial stage in the form of a

compressive stress is suddenly released. As a result, high tensile stress appears, which is

suﬃciently high to cause the fracture of the wire within 1 ms for all the cases considered.

The number of modes of the instability that are excited depends on the current magnitude

and wire length. Depending on these parameters it is possible to excite just a single mode,

which has a form of an arch, or actually any number of modes.

If a wire is slightly curved, which is a more realistic case than that of the straight wire,

the buckling instability is still possible. The amplitude of modes, that are initially present in

the curved wire, grows. The other modes can still be excited in a rapidly heated wire owing

to buckling instability. The magnitude of tensile stress induced in a curved wire is clearly

lower, but is still suﬃcient to induce a wire fracture on a millisecond timescale.

Three-dimensional eﬀects, which may be induced by the external circuit, suspensions at

the clamped ends, imperfections of the wire cross-section or a wire material, will increase

the magnitude of tensile stress. These eﬀects will lead to the coupling between ﬂexural,

longitudinal, and torsional modes. This study is beyond the scope of the present paper.

The experimental evidence, in general, is supportive of the mechanism described above.

However, no direct comparison is possible, since previous experiments were of exploratory

The model developed favours the view that the phenomenon of the wire fragmentation

in the solid state can be explained without resorting to controversial Amp`ere-Neumann

nature.

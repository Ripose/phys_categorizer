Abstract

For the free Fermion gas at thermodynamic equilibrium, the temperature which rep-

resents the averaged kinetic energy is demonstrated to have the proper property which

is invariant under the Lorentz boost, using the conceptions of the relativistic quantum

ﬁeld theory and statistical physics. The thermodynamic interaction is described by the

coupling of particles with the vacuum of a scalar pseudo-boson which features a self-

interaction. The various measurement of the apparent temperature of a moving body is

also investigated.

In thermodynamics, it is yet controversial whether the temperature which represents

the averaged kinetic energy is a scalar or a component of the vector[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

9]. Particles in a moving system obey laws of the relativistic statistical physics in which

the Lorentz factor is introduced. Two years after Einstein’s fundamental paper in 1905

on the electrodynamics of moving bodies, Einstein[10] and Planck et.al.[11] deduced the

transformation of the temperature of a thermal body observed in an inertial frame S moving

with constant velocity v with respect to the center of mass frame (rest frame) S0

T = T0/γ

(1)

v2 is

−

where T0 is the temperature at the center of mass frame of reference, T is the apparent

temperature of the moving body measured in the laboratory frame, and γ = 1/√1

the Lorentz factor. It implies that a moving body appears to be cool. This appeared to be the

standard result[12, 13]. The controversy arose as a diﬀerent transformation of temperature

had been derived by Eidington[14], Ott[15] and Mφller[16] based on the respective footings.

In their version, the transformation is as follows

T = T0γ

(2)

Landsberg[17] illustrated the temperature as a Lorentz scalar and consequently redeﬁned the

ﬁrst law of thermodynamics for moving bodies. Kampen[18] also illustrated that it is better

to take the temperature as a scalar.

There was a thought experiment proposed by Landsberg[19]. It is yet diﬃcult to clarify

the controversy by experiments since a moving body with a speed high enough is needed in

order to make the relativistic eﬀect become apparent. For this reason, the measurement of the

cosmic microwave background in speciﬁc frames has been drawn great attentions. In [7, 9], the

Unruh-DeWitt detector that moves in a background thermal bath (including also the cosmic

microwave background) was investigated theoretically and proposed to measure the relation

of temperature transformation. However, ﬁnal results can be dependent on the temperature-

deﬁning and -measuring procedures, leading to diﬀerent eﬀective temperatures[6, 7, 9].

As for our view, the temperature is a statistically collective quantity embodying the

relative motions and collisions of particles. Such a quantity would not rely on the motion

of the center of mass, or, at least it has the proper property. Is the temperature a Lorentz

2

scalar? This is the question that we try to answer here based on the conceptions of the

statistical physics and relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory.

For a many-body quantum system, the interactions make the particles to be the quasi-

particles which posses diﬀerent static properties from those of free particles. In the usual

thermo ﬁeld dynamics (for instance, see [20]), the thermodynamic interaction is elaborated

by the linear hole creation and annihilation and is constrained to produce the particle distri-

bution functions. In this way, it is not able to tell whether the single-particle (SP) property

is aﬀected by the thermodynamic interaction, since the former in the sense of the statisti-

cal average or normalization is not directly related to the distribution variation. Also, the

non-linearity due to multiple annihilations and creations which are related to bremsstrahlung

processes in the thermal environment is out of consideration in the linear treatment. In the

following, we are alternatively concerned with the variation of the SP property over statistical

average rather than that of the particle distribution.

According to the notion of modern ﬁeld theory, the interaction is mediated by medium

bosons. If this notion is applied to thermodynamic interactions, one can introduce appropriate

medium bosons for the Fermion gas at thermodynamic equilibrium. The emphasis is placed

on the thermodynamic equilibrium where the temperature can be deﬁned by some state

functions. The most favorable bosons are the scalar and vector ones. The vector boson couples

to the non-zero and conserved thermodynamic current which does not exist in the system

at thermodynamic equilibrium. One may argue that the temporal component of the vector

boson may exist. However, such an existence of the temporal component contradicts with

the invariance of the thermodynamic equilibrium under the Lorentz boost. Consequently,

there is only the scalar boson mediating the thermodynamic interaction. The coupling of the

scalar boson with the Fermion is equivalent to the heating which lifts up the Fermion mass.

The scalar boson has therefore to be of the imaginary mass, based on the knowledge of the

mean-ﬁeld treatment. The boson with the imaginary mass is however unphysical. In order

to obtain the real boson mass, the self-interaction has to be introduced. This is quite similar

to the property of the Higgs ﬁeld[21]. According to these considerations, the Lagrangian

including the Fermion and the interaction with the scalar pseudo-boson is given as follows:

where ψ is the Dirac spinor of Fermion with the mass m, φτ is the scalar pseudo-boson, µτ
and λ are the constants with µ2

τ < 0 and λ > 0. The meaning of the ’pseudo-boson’ is that the

boson leads to the increase but not decrease of the Fermion mass like the conventional boson.

Based on the viewpoint that thermodynamic equilibrium comes from energy exchanges by the

arbitrarily multiple collisions and multiple radiation, let’s see whether such a scalar coupling

is enough to contain all possible processes. Write the interaction part of the above Lagrangian

as follows:

where Sτ = φτ / < φτ > with gs = gτ < φτ >. An auxiliary scalar ﬁeld στ that is dimension-

less is introduced. The expansion power n represents the multiplicity of the interaction pro-

cesses. The boson-mediated coupling formally contains all possible thermodynamic processes.

The same coupling constant for all possible processes indicates that they are constructed in

the vertex with the same probability.

The introduction of the scalar pseudo-boson explains the heating of particles through the

simple scalar coupling. The free boson ﬁeld can be understood as the thermodynamic ﬁeld.

For the system at thermodynamic equilibrium, there must exist a constant ﬁeld quantity

coupling to the particles, and such a coupling is required to minimize the system energy.

The constant ﬁeld quantity is determined by minimizing above equation. Accordingly, it has,

It is obvious that the minimum constant ﬁeld is symmetry-breaking under the reﬂection of

internal ﬁeld space. The free thermodynamic ﬁeld has the negative minimum energy which

is actually invisible. Assuming the relation

As seen in Eq.7, the minimum of the thermodynamic ﬁeld (i.e.

The boson with the real mass should be visible in the Fermion-free space, however, such a

boson is not observed yet. We may attribute this invisibility to its high energy scale that

is not covered to date. Therefore, it is reasonable to put the boson mass mτ

. This

means that there exists the relation φ

0. The thermal heat is hence added to the system
τ ψ in Eq.8. We ﬁnd that the coupling with the isotropic ﬁeld vacuum φ0
can nicely elaborate the homogeneous thermodynamic equilibrium of the Fermion system. It

→

τ

is actually the broken vacuum of the scalar ﬁeld that plays the very role, and that is quite

similar to a precedent, the Higgs boson in the gauge theory.

The quantity gτ φ0

τ can be obtained from the fact that the mass in the center of mass

frame is of the proper property. The Fermion mass is modiﬁed due to the thermodynamic

interactions, but it is still the proper mass in the center of mass frame. According to the

equipartition theorem, the Fermion mass measured in the center of mass frame at the low

temperature limit is in the following

∗

m

0
τ = m + 3T0/2
= m + gτ φ

(11)

This indicates that the average kinetic energy which modiﬁes the proper Fermion mass is a

proper quantity. For a thermal but free Fermion system, the proper temperature T0 is deter-

mined in terms of the dynamic scalar coupling. We recall that we have excluded the existence

5

of the vector boson by the ﬁeld theory at thermodynamic equilibrium, which is necessary to

obtain a proper temperature other than the component of a vector. It is worthwhile to note

that the single Fermion property in the thermal environment is treated in the sense of the

statistical average or normalization in the total phase space involved.

For a moving body, one needs to measure the apparent temperature T . It is able to obtain

various apparent temperature without violating the relativity principle and the structure of

the Dirac equation. There is the following relation for the total energy E of one particle in

a co-moving system

E =

p2 + m∗2 = γm

(12)

where the apparent temperature is given as T = T0γ, which is the result of Eq.2[14, 15, 16].
On the other hand, we note that the density of thermal heat ρτ = gτ ¯ψφ0

τ ψ is a Lorentz
d3xρτ is not a Lorentz scalar due to the volume
scalar, while the total thermal heat Q =
element d3x. According to the deﬁnition T = ∂Q/∂S with S the entropy, it has the relation

R

T = T0/γ which is the result of Eq.1[10, 11]. The distinct diﬀerence arises from the diﬀerent

measurement. The former is by means of the mass measurement, while the latter is through

measuring the volume. The diﬀerent measurement actually corresponds to diﬀerent deﬁni-

tions or deduction of the apparent temperature. It is important to make clear what deﬁnitions

and their relations of thermodynamic quantities are used for measurement and deduction.
If one performs a coincident mass and volume measurement for the quantity (m∗

Q), the

·

apparent temperature is then T = T0. More coincident measurements can be performed

under various combinations. The measurement dependence of the apparent temperature was

discussed also on the subject of the black body radiation[6, 7, 9].

In summary, the thermodynamic motion is illustrated in a dynamic framework where

the thermodynamic interaction is described by a scalar boson exchange based on notions of

the relativistic ﬁeld theory and statistical physics. The boson ﬁeld has the self-interaction

which gives rise to its real mass. The homogeneous coupling of the Fermion with the broken

vacuum of the scalar ﬁeld modiﬁes the Fermion mass. The heat amount added to the system

is described through the coupling with such a vacuum. The measurement dependence of the

apparent temperature have been also investigated based on the relativity principle and the

structure of the Dirac equation. In conclusion, the temperature in the free Fermion gas is

demonstrated to have the proper property in terms of the structure of the Dirac equation,

6

while the controversy for diﬀerent apparent temperature seems to come from the diﬀerent

deﬁnition and measurement.

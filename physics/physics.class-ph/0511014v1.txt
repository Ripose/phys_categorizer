Abstract

The force due to electromagnetic induction on a test charge is calculated in diﬀerent reference
frames. The Faraday-Lenz Law and diﬀerent formulae for the ﬁelds of a uniformly moving charge
are used. The classical Heaviside formula for the electric ﬁeld of a moving charge predicts that
the inductive force vanishes in the frame in which the magnet is in motion and the test charge
at rest. In contrast, consistent results, in diﬀerent frames, are given by the recently derived
formulae of relativistic classical electrodynamics.

PACS 03.30.+p 03.50.De

In the introduction of his 1905 paper on special relativity [1] Einstein discussed the
phenomenon of elecromagnetic induction, discovered by Faraday, viewed either from a
frame in which the magnet is motion, or from one in which it is at rest. In this letter a
careful re-analysis of this problem is performed in terms of the force on a test charge of
magnitude q in the vicinity of a magnet. The force on the charge, due to electromagnetic
induction, is calculated in both the inertial frame, S, in which the magnet is a rest and
the test charge is in motion as well as the frame, S’, in which the magnet is in motion
and the test charge is at rest.

Three diﬀerent methods are used to perform the calculation:

(i) Application of the Faraday-Lenz Law.

(ii) Application of the Lorentz Force Law, using standard formulae of Classical Electro-
magnetism [2, 3] (CEM) for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of a uniformly moving
charge.

(iii) The formulae of Relativistic Classical Electrodynamics (RCED) [4, 5], a covariant
formalism developed recently by the present author, are used to calculate directly
inter-charge forces.

The corresponding formulae are:

For the CEM and RCED calculations the force on the test charge is given by the Lorentz
Force Law:

~F = q( ~E + ~β × ~B)

p

1 − β2

where β ≡ v/c, v is the speed of the test charge, and c is the speed of light in vacuum. In
Eqns(2-5) the ‘source’ charge of magnitude Q moves with uniform velocity u ≡ βuc along
u, cos ψ = (~v · ~r)/|~v · ~r|, ~r is the spatial vector connecting the
the x-axis, γu ≡ 1/
source and test charges, and ˆı, ˆ and ˆk are unit vectors parallel to the x-, y- and z-axes.
In order to reduce the problem to its essentials, the ‘magnet’ is constituted of just two
equal charges of magnitude Q with equal and opposite velocities ~u+ , ~u− ,|~u+| = |~u−| = u
in the conﬁguration shown in Fig.1a. The charges move parallel to the z-axis and are
situated at (x,y,z) = (0,y,0) and (0,-y,0), while the test charge is near to the symmetry
point (x,0,0) and moves with velocity ˆıv in the rest frame of the ‘magnet’ constituted by
the two source charges. Adding further moving charges, equidistant from the test charge,
uniformly on a ring of radius y, to give a ‘one turn solenoid’ complicates the evaluation
of the ﬁelds and forces, but adds nothing to the essential dynamics of the problem. Since
magnets are usually electrically neutral, the correspondence with a magnet constituted
by an electron circulating in an atom or a one-turn solenoid would be made more exact
by placing charges -Q, at rest in S, adjacent to the moving charges. Since however such
charges produce no magnetic ﬁeld in S, and an electric ﬁeld at the test charge conﬁned
to the x-y plane in both S and S’, the following calculations of electromagnetic induction,
where both electric and magnetic forces are parallel to the z-axis, is unchanged by the
presence of such ‘neutralising’ charges. They are therefore not considered in the following.
In order to apply the Faraday-Lenz Law an imaginary rectangular current loop ABCD
is drawn through the test charge in a plane perpendicular to the x-axis as shown in Fig.1a.
If a = AB ≪ b = BC, then, because of the symmetrical position of the loop, magnetic
ﬂux will, to a good approximation, cross only the short sides AB and DC as the loop
attached to the test charge moves through the ﬁeld. In consequence, the line integral in
(1) reduces to 2Eza. Since (see Fig.1a) ψ = π/2, (3) or (5) give ~B(CEM) = ~B(RCED)
and the magnetic ﬂux, φ threading the loop ABCD is:

φ(CEM) = φ(RCED) = ab[(B+)x + (B−)x] =

2abQγuβu cos θ

aIn RCEM the forces between charges are calculated directly without the introduction of any ﬁeld concept [4]. For
comparision purposes the terms in the force formula corresponding to the usual deﬁnitions of electric and magnetic
forces in Eqn(6) are expressed here in terms of corresponding electric and magnetic ﬁelds ~E(RCED) and ~B(RCED).

where ~B+ and ~B− are the magnetic ﬁelds due to the charges with velocity ~u+ and ~u−
respectively. Diﬀerentiating (7) w.r.t. x, noting that v = dx/dt, and using (1) gives:

The force on the test charge in S is now calculated using the Lorentz Force Law (6).
Since both the CEM and RCED electric ﬁelds at the test charge lie in the x-y plane, only
the magnetic force contributes in the z-direction. This force is given by the y-component
of ~B+ + ~B− at the point (x,b/2,0). From the geometry of the x-y plane, shown in Fig.1b,
and (3) or (5) with ψ = π/2:

in agreement, to ﬁrst order in b, with the Faraday-Lenz Law result (9).

The above calculations are now carried out in the frame S’ where the magnet is in
motion and the test charge is at rest. Using Eqns(3) and (5) it follows from the geometry
of Fig.2 that, the magnetic ﬂuxes threading the loop ABCD in the frame S’ are:

Note that each component of the spatial separation of the test and source charges remains
invariant under Lorentz transformation [4, 6, 7] so that, as shown in Fig.2, there is no
distinction between the spatial interval x and x′, y and y′ and r and r′, or between the

is at rest and the test charge, of magnitude q, moves with velocity ~v along the +ve x-axis. The
‘magnet’ consists of two charges of magnitude Q moving along the z-axis in opposite directions, each
with speed u. The imaginary ﬂux-loop ABCD is attached to the test charge. Various distances and
angles are deﬁned. ~B+ and ~B− are the magnetic ﬁelds at (x,0,0) generated by the charges of velocity

angles θ and θ′. Since the calculation of the rate of change of the ﬂux threading the
loop is the same whether the loop is displaced with velocity v along the +ve x-axis as
in S (Fig.1) or the source of the magnetic ﬁeld is displaced with velocity v along the -ve
x-axis as in S’ (Fig.2) the calculation of the z-component of the electric ﬁeld using the
Faraday-Lenz Law proceeds as above, with the results:

When the force calculations are performed in the frame S’, by use of the Faraday-Lenz
Law, consistent results are therefore, in general, no longer obtained. Only in the limit
θ → 0 when the inductive force vanishes do the CEM and RQED predictions become
equal.

Since the vectors ~r+, ~r− lie in the x’-y’ plane, and the electric ﬁeld in the CEM formula
(2) is radial, it follows that the electric ﬁeld at the test charge in S’ also lies in this plane.
Thus Eqn(2) predicts no force, parallel to the z’ axis, acts on the test charge in S’. That
is, that there is no eﬀect of electromagnetic induction in this frame, in contradiction both
the requirements of special relativity and the prediction of the Faraday-Lenz Law using
either CEM or RCED ﬁelds.

Finally the calculation is performed in the frame S’ using the RCED electric ﬁeld (4).

From the geometries of Fig.1b and Fig.2b:

~r+ = r+(ˆı sin θ+ − ˆ cos θ+)

~r− = r−(ˆı sin θ+ + ˆ cos θ−)
~β′
+ = βu′(−ˆı sin α + ˆk cos α)
~β′
− = βu′(−ˆı sin α − ˆk cos α)

so that:

~r+ · ~β′
~r− · ~β′

+ = −βu′r+ sin θ+ sin α = −βu′x sin α

− = −βu′r− sin θ+ sin α = −βu′x sin α

Eqns(18), (19), (22), (23) and (4) then give:

have been used. This result agrees with that, (17), obtained by use of the Faraday-Lenz

so in these cases the forces in S and S’ diﬀer only by corrections of order the fourth power
in the ratio of charge velocities to the speed of light. In summary, in the frame S, where
the magnet is at rest, so that the magnetic ﬁelds are ‘static’, and the test charge is in
motion, all three methods of calculation yield the same result (9) or (13) to the considered
calculational accuracy. However when the Faraday-Lenz Law is used to perform the
calculation in the frame S’ where the magnet is in motion and the test charge is at
rest, the CEM result (16) is found to diﬀer from the RCED one (17) by terms of O(β2).
The CEM electric ﬁeld formula (2) predicts the complete absence of electromagnetic
induction in the frame S’, in contradiction with the Faraday-Lenz Law predictions in
this frame, and with special relativity. The incompatibility of this formula, ﬁrst derived
by Heaviside [8], more than a decade before the advent of special relativity, with the
requirements of the latter has been previously demonstrated by comparing calculations
of Rutherford scattering in diﬀerent inertial frames [5] as well as by Jackson’s ‘Torque
Paradox’ [9], which is resolved [5] by the use of the RCED force formula that is the
combination of (4),(5) and (6). It is interesting to note that the Heaviside formula for
the electric ﬁeld of a uniformly moving charge was experimentally excluded by one of
the very ﬁrst experiments on electromagnetic induction performed by Faraday –that in
which a bar magnet was moved inside the coil of a solenoid connected to a galvanometerb.
No knowledge of special relativity, or any detailed calculation, is needed to draw this
conclusion, simply the observation that the ﬁeld given by the formula is radial. Indeed,
Heaviside himself could have realised that such a formula does not correctly describe the
forces between charges in motion by applying it to Faraday’s experiment. .

All four results (9),(13),(17) and (26) of the calculations of the force, using the RCED
formulae, give consistent results. The forces in the frames S and S’ are found to diﬀer
only by corrections of order the fourth power in the ratio of velocities to the speed of
light. The forces are diﬀerent due to the relativistic time dilatation eﬀect which results
in diﬀerent accelerations in diﬀerent inertial frames. That forces are diﬀerent in diﬀerent
inertial frames is already evident from inspection of Eqns(4) and (5) by comparing the
ﬁelds in the frame where the source charge is at rest (βu = 0, γu = 1) with those shown
for an arbitary value of βu.

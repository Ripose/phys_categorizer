REPLY TO “CRITICISM OF ‘NECESSITY OF SIMULTANEOUS CO-EXISTENCE
OF INSTANTANEOUS AND RETARDED INTERACTIONS
IN CLASSICAL ELECTRODYNAMICS’ ” by J.D.Jackson

In this note we show that Jackson’s criticism of our work “Necessity of simultaneous
co-existence of. . . ” is based on an inexact understanding of the basic assumptions and
conclusions of our work.

In his note1 J.D.Jackson aﬃrms that in our work2 we “make the claim that
the electric and magnetic ﬁelds derived from the Li´enard-Wiechert potentials for a
charged particle in arbitrary motion do not satisfy the Maxwell equations”. This
aﬃrmation of J.D.Jackson does not correspond to a keynote of our work.

Let us begin with our general objections to Jackson’s criticism. Actually, one of
the aims of our work was to show that the direct use (from the mathematical point
of view) of the following idea of Landau and Lifshitz3 (see the quotation below)
leads to a contradiction:

“To calculate the intensities of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds from

the formulas

E = −∇ϕ −

B = [∇ × A].

we must diﬀerentiate ϕ and A with respect to the coordinates x, y, z of
the point, and the time t of observation. But the formulas (63.5, Ref.3)

ϕ(r, t) =

A(r, t) =

t0 = t − τ = t −

(3)

as implicit functions of x, y, z, t. Therefore to calculate the required
derivatives we must ﬁrst calculate the derivatives of t0”

In other words, if one takes into account exclusively the implicit dependence of the
potentials and ﬁelds on time t, one obtains correct ﬁelds, but these ﬁelds

do not satisfy the Maxwell equations. Once more: if, following Landau and Lifshitz
aforementioned idea, one does not take into account the explicit dependence of ﬁelds
on t, rather only the implicit one, we can see that in this case (exclusively in this
case!) ﬁelds (4) and (5) do not satisfy Maxwell equations.

In Section 4 of our work2 we showed that Faraday’s law is obeyed if one considers
the functions E and B as functions with both implicit and explicit dependence on
t (or on xi).a That is why we do not understand why J.D.Jackson did the same in
Section 4 of his work1. It seems to us that a basic reason behind Jackson’s antago-
nism to our work is the following: our interpretation of the explicit time-dependence
as a certain manifestation of instantaneous action-at-a-distance and on the other
hand the implicit time-dependence (i.e. exclusively through the relation (3)) as a
well-known short-range action. From the generally acceptedb formal mathematical
point of view our work is faultless. Let us explain this point more particularly.

In his work1 J.D.Jackson considers our expression

∂R
∂t0

= −c

(6)

as wrong, refering to formula R = r − r0(t0). The point is what one means by
the operator ∂
It is easy to prove that in the

Landau and Lifshitz mean by ∂R

∂t the total derivative and not partial one! (Recall
that our index (0) corresponds to the index (′) in Ref. 3). In order to obtain a value
of ∂t0
∂t one cannot perform the usual operation of diﬀerentiation. It is possible to
calculate this derivative using a certain mathematical trick only. The authors of
REf. 3 use the fact that two diﬀerent expressions of the function R exist:

R = c(t − t0),

where

t0 = f (x, y, z, t),

(8)

and

R = [(x − x0)2 + (y − y0)2 + (z − z0)2]1/2,

where

x0i = fi(t0).

(9)

It is well-known from the classical analysis that if a given function is expressed
by two diﬀerent types of functional dependencies, then exclusively total derivatives
of these expressions with respect to a given variable can be equated (contrary to
the partial ones). Comparing the total derivatives of R from Eq.(8) and R from
Eq.(9) Landau and Lifshitz obtain the corrected value of ∂t0
∂t . So one can see that
the expression ∂R
is the total derivative
∂t

. And from

one can see that ∂R

expressions are just formal mathematical equalities and they do not have any phys-
ical sense but help us to ﬁnd a value of ∂t0
∂t . Let adduce the scheme which was
implicitly used in Ref. 3 to obtain ∂t0/∂t and ∂t0/∂xi:

If one takes into account that ∂t/∂xi = ∂xi/∂t = 0, as a result one obtains the

correct expressions for ∂t0/∂t and ∂t0/∂xi.

Finally, regarding two phrases of J.D.Jackson in the Abstract and at the close
of Ref. 1: “Classical electromagnetic theory is complete as usually expressed”
and “Electromagnetic theory is complete in any chosen gauge”, two suﬃciently
authoritative physicists of 20-th century help us:

R. Feynman6:

“...this tremendous ediﬁce (classical electrodynamics), which is such
a beautiful success in explaining so many phenomena, ultimately falls
on its face. ...Classical mechanics is a mathematically consistent theory;
It is interesting, though, that
it just doesn’t agree with experience.
the classical theory of electromagnetism is an unsatisfactory theory all
by itself. There are diﬃculties associated with the ideas of Maxwell’s
theory which are not solved by and not directly associated with quantum
mechanics...”

“We therefore see that the Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics is quite
incompatible with the existence of charges, unless it is supplemented by
extraneous theoretical concepts” (The choice of italics was Pauli’s).

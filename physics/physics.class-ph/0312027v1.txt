Despite 180 years of theory on magnetism,

it appears
that the practice of calculating forces on magnetic media is
ambiguous, as illustrated by a recent article in this Journal
[1]. Potentially troubling issues include: Which ﬁeld B or H
should be used? Should the total ﬁeld be used, or only the
external ﬁeld? And if the latter, what is meant by “external”?
Can/should eﬀects of magnetization currents and/or ﬁctitious
magnetic poles be included? What is the force on only a por-
tion of a circuit? We review several well-known approaches
to magnetic force calculations on elements of rigid circuits,
and ﬁnd it very helpful to use an explicit example to compare
and contrast the various methods. Our discussion reinforces
that of the most authoritative texts [2,3], but corrects in an
important way a previous attempt at a systematic review in
this Journal [4–7].

I. INTRODUCTION

The phenomenon of magnetism was ﬁrst manifested
via interactions of bulk magnetic materials (magnets).
Following the discovery by Oersted [8] that pairs of cur-
rents exerted forces on one another, Biot and Savart [9]
identiﬁed a corresponding force law, and Amp`ere [10]
made the conjecture that all magnetic phenomena are
actually due to currents, some of which may be bound
in “molecules” of magnetic materials. This view con-
trasted with the elegant work of Poisson [11] in which
forces on magnetic materials (without conduction cur-
rents) could be explained in terms of a density of mag-
netic poles bound in the media in such a way that single
poles can never be isolated.

Pedagogic discussions of forces on magnetic media tend
to treat the case of current-carrying conductors sepa-
rately from that of materials (typically conductors) that
have nonzero bulk magnetization. The present article
addresses the general case of magnetic media in which
conduction currents are ﬂowing, but is restricted to the
case of forces on elements of a rigid circuit. The litera-
ture on this topic appears to be both sparse and erratic,
and we have the (possibly unrealistic) hope of clarifying
the record.

Because the details prove to be intricate, the best im-
pression that a reader may form is simply that one must
approach magnetic force problems with caution.

Some more speciﬁc conclusions from this eﬀort are:

1. The consequence of Newton’s 1st law that an ob-
ject does not exert a net force on itself is a guiding
principle in the analysis of static forces on rigid cir-
cuits. See sec. III. We do not pursue here the more
complex case of deformable magnetic media.

2. In calculating the force on a circuit (or on a portion
of a rigid circuit) one can use only that magnetic

ﬁeld which existed prior to the introduction of the
circuit, since the ﬁelds produced directly (or indi-
rectly via induced magnetization) cannot cause a
net force on the circuit (or portion of a rigid cir-
cuit). See sec. III.

3. Methods also exist in which the total magnetic ﬁeld
can be used in the force calculation, even if the
force on only a portion of a rigid circuit is de-
sired. The most straightforward of these uses the
Maxwell stress tensor (sec. VIII), which the author
recommends be given more prominence in peda-
gogic treatments of electrostatic and magnetostatic
forces.

4. Considerable care must be given in the treatment
of systems that include an interface across which
the magnetic permeability changes discontinuously.
See secs. IV-IX.

5. If the Helmholtz bulk force density (calculated from
the total magnetic ﬁelds) is used to ﬁnd the force by
integration over a volume that contains such an in-
terface, the volume integral must be supplemented
by a surface integral over the (interior) interface.
See sec. IX.

6. In a calculation of the force that uses the concept
of magnetization currents, the magnetic ﬁeld H
should be used rather than the ﬁeld B, and if the
force is desired on only a circuit element, the ﬁeld
must be Hi as existed prior to the introduction of
the circuit (and not merely the introduction of the
circuit element). See sec. VI.

7. In a calculation of the force that uses the concept
of magnetic poles, the magnetic ﬁeld B should be
used rather than the ﬁeld H, and the prior ﬁeld Bi
should be used if the force on only a circuit element
is desired. See sec. VII.

While conclusions 5 and 6 may be known to those
expert with magnetic media, the author has not found
them in the literature. Because several of the conclu-
sions amend conventional pedagogic wisdom, it has been
critical to verify these conclusions with an example in
which both I × B forces and magnetization forces are
present, and which contains an interface with diﬀerent
permeabilities on either side.

before the wire is placed in that ﬁeld? The medium sur-
rounding the wire is a liquid with relative permeability
µ 6= 1. The wire is assumed to be part of a rigid circuit
that is completely by a loop at “inﬁnity”.

Note that in asking for the force on the wire along the
z axis, we seek the force on only a portion of the complete
circuit.

The form of the initial magnetic ﬁeld has been chosen
so that there will be both a J × B force associated with
the uniform ﬁeld B0 = B0 ˆx, as well as a force due to
the interaction of the induced magnetization with the
nonuniform ﬁeld B1 = B1[(x/a)ˆx − (y/a)ˆy].

We have conﬁrmed by the four methods of calculation
discussed in secs. VI-IX that the force per unit length on
the wire is, in Gaussian units,

F = −

µ − µ′
µ + µ′

aB0H1

where the magnetic ﬁelds H and

B = H + 4πM,

are related in a linear, isotropic medium of relative per-
meability µ by

B = µH,

and hence the magnetization density M obeys

M =

µ − 1
4π
The magnetic ﬁeld H for this example is given in the
Appendix, and details of the calculations can be found
in [12].

H.

If the initial magnetic ﬁeld is uniform (B1 = 0), then
there is no net force on the magnetization of the wire or
surrounding medium, and the force per unit length on
the wire has the very simple form

F =

IB0
c

ˆy

(uniform external ﬁeld).

(7)

The expression (7) has been veriﬁed in a recent ex-
periment Casperson [1]. See also a related discussion by
Lowes [13].

Strictly speaking, eq. (7) describes the force on the
conduction electrons, and not that on the lattice of posi-
tive ions through which the electrons ﬂow. The force (7)
results in a slight rearrangement of the distribution of the
conduction electrons and positive lattice ions so that a
transverse electric ﬁeld is generated that acts on the lat-
tice to provide the force experienced by an observer who
holds the wire at rest. See [14] for further discussion.

III. THE BIOT-SAVART FORCE LAW

The result (7) is to be expected from a simple argu-
ment, consistent with Newton’s ﬁrst law that an object
does not exert a net force on itself. Namely, the Biot-
Savart force law (for media of unit permeability) on a
current-carrying circuit a due to a current-carrying cir-
cuit b is

Fa =

where

.

In the example of sec. II, the initial ﬁeld Bi plays the
role of the ﬁeld Bb not due the current in wire a, which
quickly leads to the result (7). The reader may object
that the example does not involve media of unit perme-
ability, so the Biot-Savart force law may have to be mod-
iﬁed in such a way as to lead to a diﬀerent result than
(7). This issue will be pursued in the following section.
The statement that an object cannot exert a net force
on itself tacitly presumes that the object has mechani-
cal integrity as a whole, and will generate internal elas-
tic forces to counteract possible electromagnetic forces of
one part of the object on another. If a magnetic circuit
is mechanically ﬂexible, we will not be content with an
analysis of the force on the circuit as a whole.
In ad-
dition, we desire a calculation of magnetic force on an
element of the circuit, imagining it to be mechanically
(but not electrically) disconnected from the rest of the
circuit.
In this case, the magnetic ﬁeld to be used in
diﬀerential form to the Biot-Savart force law is the ﬁeld
Bext due to all sources outside the element itself,
I
c

dl × Bext.

dF =

(10)

The diﬀerential expression (10) can have meaning inde-
pendent of the integral form (8) only if the circuit de-
forms, in which case the problem is not one of statics.
It is well known that the diﬀerential force (10) does not
satisfy Newton’s 3rd law in cases of isolated current el-
ements, because in such dynamical systems the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld momentum is varying [16]. Newton’s 3rd
law is respected via the appropriate electromagnetic ver-
sion of his 2nd law,

where Pmech and PEM are the mechanical and electro-
magnetic momenta, respectively. For a discussion of de-
formable circuits, see [17]. The topic of forces on mag-
netic liquids, including striction eﬀects, is treated in [18].
In the remainder of this article we assume that the
object on which we desire to calculate the magnetic force
is a rigid body at rest.

IV. MICROSCOPIC AND MACROSCOPIC
MAGNETIC FIELDS

no matter what permeabilities exist. Thus, we reaﬃrm
that eq. (7) is the force on the wire in our example, if the
initial ﬁeld is uniform.

In the macroscopic approach to calculation of forces on
magnetic media one considers in general a current density
J (electric charge crossing a directed unit area per unit
time) and a net magnetization density M (net magnetic
dipole moment per unit volume) as well as the magnetic
ﬁelds B and H = B − 4πM. In a microscopic view one
considers collections of individual charges and/or mag-
netic moments, but averaged quantities like the magneti-
zation density M are not yet deﬁned. Hence, the ﬁelds B
and H are identical in the microworld, and it is a matter
of convention which symbol is used for the microscopic
magnetic ﬁeld.

The symbol H was used for the magnetic ﬁeld by the
early workers Amp`ere, Biot and Savart, and Poisson [11],
which led authors such as Lorentz [19] and Landau [3] to
use this symbol for the microscopic magnetic ﬁeld. The
symbol B was introduced by Thomson around 1850 [21]
in the form (5), which suggests that it is to be derived
from the more fundamental (or anyway more familiar at
the time) ﬁeld H. However, as apparently ﬁrst noted by
Lorentz [19], the macroscopic average of the microscopic
magnetic ﬁeld is B and not H.

To maximize the continuity between the microscopic
and macroscopic views, the author prefers that the mi-
croscopic magnetic ﬁeld be labeled B. Then, the force
on an electric charge e with velocity v in microscopic
electromagnetic ﬁelds E and B is

F = e

E +

× B

,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

v
c

(12)

the Lorentz force law, which also represents the average
force on the charge in the presence of macroscopically
averaged ﬁelds E and B. It is always understood that the
ﬁelds E and B in the Lorentz force law do not include
the ﬁelds of the moving charge itself.

High-energy physicists such as the present author, con-
sider the Lorentz force law (12) to be experimentally con-
ﬁrmed (and continually reconﬁrmed) for over 50 years
[22] in the case of high-energy particles moving inside
media such as iron where B = µH ≫ H. That is, when
applying the Lorentz force law a charge inside a macro-
scopic medium, the appropriate macroscopic average of
the microscopic magnetic ﬁeld is indeed the macroscopic
ﬁeld B. This insight is aﬃrmed in sec. 8.2 of [15], and
sec. 22.1.1 of [23],

We therefore expect that other methods of calculating
forces on currents in macroscopic media will be consistent
with the Lorentz force law using the macroscopic ﬁeld B.
In particular, we expect that the Biot-Savart force law
for a current I in a macroscopic magnetic ﬁeld Bi not
due to that current itself is

V. THE BIOT-SAVART FORCE LAW IN A
PERMEABLE MEDIUM

Despite the simplicity of the result (13), care is needed
when using the Biot-Savart force law in permeable me-
dia. We review this issue by starting with the case that
all wires and their surrounding media have the same per-
meability µ 6= 1. Then there is neither a surface current
nor a ﬁctitious pole density at the interface between the
wire and the liquid. However, there remains a volume
current density

JM = c∇ × M =

∇ × H = (µ − 1)Jcond,

(14)

using Amp`ere’s law,

∇ × H =

Jcond,

(15)

that relates the magnetic ﬁeld H to the conduction cur-
rent density Jcond. Thus, the total current density is

Jtotal = µJcond.

(16)

The fact that the total current density (16) does not
equal the conduction current density in a permeable
medium contradicts the view of Lorentz [19], as reaf-
ﬁrmed in sec. 30 of [3]. This appears to be one of the
very few oversights in these distinguished works.

The force (13) on the wire that carries conduction cur-

rent density Jcond can be written as

F =

Jcond × Bi dVol.

(17)

If instead we wish to use the total current density (16)
we must write

F =

1

Jtotal

c Z

× Bi dVol =

Jtotal × Hi dVol. (18)

Another aspect of the analysis of Biot and Savart is the
calculation of the magnetic ﬁeld from the current density.
The microscopic version of Amp`ere’s law,

∇ × B =

Jtotal,

(19)

4π

corresponds to the prescription that

B =

1
c Z

Jtotal × ˆr
r2

dVol =

c Z

Jcond × ˆr

dVol = µH,

(20)

supposing the permeability is uniform and may be taken
outside the integral. Hence, the macroscopic version of

3

Amp`ere’s law, eq. (15), corresponds to the prescription
that

H =

1
c Z

Jcond × ˆr
r2

dVol = ∇ ×

dVol,

(21)

independent of the permeability. This result, combined
with Amp`ere’s law (15), is consistent with Helmholtz’
theorem [15] provided ∇ · H = 0, as holds within a
medium of uniform permeability.

The form of the eq. (8) for the force on circuit a due to
circuit b supposing the wires and the surrounding media
all have permeability µ is therefore

Fa = µ

dla ×

IaIb
c2 Ia

dlb × ˆrab

(22)

where Ia and Ib are the conduction currents in the cir-
cuits.

and the total current density is Jtotal = µ′Iˆz/πa2 from
eqs. (1) and (16). Then, evaluation of eq. (24) leads to
eq. (3).

The correct result for the force on a portion of a rigid
circuit would not be obtained from eq. (24) if we used the
initial magnetic ﬁeld Bi, or if we used the total magnetic
ﬁelds B or H on the wire. Furthermore, we would not
obtain a correct result if we used the ﬁeld in a vacuum
cavity of radius a at the position of the wire either before
or after the wire was inserted. The proper initial ﬁeld
Hi is the one before the wire was inserted into the liquid
dielectric.

When µ 6= µ′ 6= 1, we cannot rewrite the ﬁrst term of
(Jcond/c)× Bi dVol, which would incorrectly
eq. (24) as
suggest that we could ignore the volume magnetization
current density JM but not the surface current density
KM .

VI. THE BIOT-SAVART FORCE LAW PLUS
BOUND CURRENT DENSITIES

VII. THE BIOT-SAVART FORCE LAW PLUS
FICTITIOUS MAGNETIC POLES

We also see that eq. (22) holds even if the wires have
permeabilities µa and µb that diﬀer from the permeability
µ of the surrounding medium, since the magnetic ﬁeld
due to wire b at the position of wire a before wire a
was introduced is given by Bb = µHb, which depends on
neither µa nor µb. However, in this case there will exist
eﬀective surface currents,

Following Poisson [11], the forces on the magnetization
of the media can also considered as due to a density of
ﬁctitious magnetic poles, rather than being due to cur-
rents JM and KM . Some care is required to use this
approach, since a true magnetic pole density ρM would
imply ∇ · B = 4πρM , and the bulk force density on
these poles would be F = ρM B. However, in reality
0 = ∇ · B = ∇ · (H + 4πM), so we write

KM = c∆M × ˆn,

(23)

∇ · H = −4π∇ · M = 4πρM ,

(26)

at the interface between the wires and the surrounding
medium, where ∆M is the diﬀerence between the mag-
netization on the two sides of the interface, and ˆn is the
unit normal to the interface. The force on these surface
currents follows the form (18) that uses the magnetic ﬁeld
H rather than B. Hence the total force on a permeable
wire surrounded by a permeable medium can be written
as

F =

Jtotal × Hi dVol +

KM × Hi dS.

(24)

c Z

The is the appropriate version of the Biot-Savart law
if we wish to include magnetization forces via the so-
called bound current densities. However, the Coulomb
Committee in their eq. (1.3-4′) [6], and Jeﬁmenko in his
eq. (14-9.13a,b) [20], recommends that the initial ﬁeld
Bi be used rather than Hi, which would imply a force µ
times the above.

For the example of sec. II, the surface current density
is obtained from eq. (6) and the total magnetic ﬁeld H,
eq. (43), as

KM =

(cid:21)

ˆz,

and we identify ρM = −∇ · M as the volume density of
ﬁctitious magnetic poles. Inside linear magnetic media,
such as those considered here, B = µH and ∇ · B = 0
together imply that ρM = 0. However, a surface density
σM of ﬁctitious poles can exist on an interface between
two media, and we see that Gauss’ law for the ﬁeld H
implies that

σM =

(H2 − H1) · ˆn
4π

,

(27)

where unit normal ˆn points across the interface from
medium 1 to medium 2. The surface pole density can
also be written in terms of the magnetization M =
(B − H)/4π as

σM = (M1 − M2) · ˆn,

(28)

since ∇ · B = 0 insures that the normal component of B
is continuous at the interface.

The force on the surface density of ﬁctitious magnetic

poles is

F = σM Bi,

(29)

(25)

since the ﬁctitious poles couple to the macroscopic aver-
age of the microscopic magnetic ﬁeld, as anticipated by

4

Thomson and Maxwell [24]. Equation (29) is in agree-
ment with prob. 5.20 of [26]. However, the Coulomb
Committee in their eq. (1.3-4) [6], and Jeﬁmenko in his
eq. (14-9.9a,b) [20], recommends that the initial ﬁeld Hi
be used rather than Bi when using the method of ﬁc-
titious magnetic poles, which would imply a force 1/µ
times the above.

The total force on the medium in this view is the sum
of the force on the conduction current plus the force on
the ﬁctitious surface poles, where to avoid calculating a
spurious force of the rigid wire on itself we use the initial
magnetic ﬁeld Bi,

F =

Jcond × Bi dVol +

σM Bi dS.

(30)

c Z

In the example of sec. II, the density of ﬁctitious mag-

netic poles on the surface r = a is given by

σM =

4π

= −

1
2π

µ − µ′
µ + µ′ (H0 cos θ + H1 cos 2θ).

Then, evaluation of eq. (30) again leads to the result
(3). This reaﬃrms that one should use the initial ﬁeld
Bi and not Hi and not the total ﬁeld B in the Biot-
Savart method (30) with ﬁctitious magnetic poles when
calculating the force on only a portion of a rigid circuit.

VIII. THE MAXWELL STRESS TENSOR

The methods of calculating the force on a circuit dis-
cussed thus far are require care in that only the ﬁelds Bi
and Hi prior to the addition of the circuit appear explic-
itly in the force calculation, although the total ﬁelds B
and H are needed in the calculation of the magnetization.
The erratic literature on this topic is ample evidence that
confusion as how to implement these calculation is likely.
Hence, it may be preferable to use methods that in-
volve only the total ﬁelds B and H. In the author’s view,
the most reliable general method for the calculation of
electromagnetic forces is that based on the Maxwell stress
tensor [29], which is a formal transcription of Faraday’s
“tubes of force”. The j component of the electromag-
netic force F on the interior of a closed volume in a linear
medium with oriented surface element dS is given by

Fj =

TjkdSk,

Z Xk

(32)

where

1
4π

Tjk =

Ej Dk + BjHk −

(E · D + B · H).

(33)

δjk
8π

The form (33) ignores interesting strictive eﬀects in com-
pressible media [28].

The surface over which the stress tensor is integrated
need not correspond to a physical surface, which leads to
the question of how the electromagnetic force is trans-
mitted to the physical matter inside that surface. The
answer is, of course, via the electromagnetic ﬁelds that
enter into the stress tensor. Prior to, and even some-
what after, Maxwell, more physical explanations were
considered necessary, which led to the diversionary search
for the æther that, among other activities, would trans-
mit the forces from the imaginary surface to the matter
within.

We have already noted in sec. II that even the J × B
force concept is at least once removed from a force on
the positive ion lattice of a conductor – which caused
confusion to Maxwell [30].

For the example of sec. II, we calculate the force on
unit length of the wire by integrating the Maxwell stress
tensor over a cylindrical surface of radius r > a, so that
any eﬀects at the surface r = a are included. The result
is, as expected, given by eq. (3), independent of radius r.
Equation (3) for the case that B1 = 0 was deduced in

(31)

a similar manner in ref. [2].

If we integrate the stress tensor over a cylinder of ra-

dius r < a the result is

F =

2µ′
µ + µ′

IB0
c

r2
a2.

ˆy.

(34)

Since the limit of this as r → a does not equal the result
(3) for r > a, we infer that there are important eﬀects at
the interface r = a. The permeable liquid is presumably
contained in a tank of some characteristic radial scale
b ≫ a, at whose surface additional magnetization forces
will arise. We consider these forces as distinct from those
at the interface r = a, and that only the latter are part
of the forces on the wire.

IX. THE HELMHOLTZ BULK FORCE DENSITY

An expression for a bulk force density f in magnetic
media can be obtained by transformation of the surface
integral of the stress tensor into a volume integral. See,
for example, secs. 15 and 35 of [3]. The result, again
ignoring magnetostriction, is

f =

Jcond × B −

∇µ,

(35)

1
c

H 2
8π

which is due to Helmholtz [27]. As for the Maxwell stress
tensor, the ﬁelds B and H in eq. (35) are the total ﬁelds
from all sources.

However, eq. (35) is not suﬃcient for the case that
the permeability takes a discontinuous step at an inter-
face within the volume of interest. To see this, we recall
the usual derivation of the bulk force density, beginning
with Gauss’ law to transform the surface integral of the
Maxwell stress tensor into a volume integral of a force
density f,

The magnetic ﬁeld H for the example of sec. II is, in

both cylindrical and rectangular coordinates,

since ∇·B = 0 always, and we ﬁrst suppose that B = µH

using Amp`ere’s law (15). Inserting eq. (38) in (37) we

cludes an interior interface across which the permeability
takes a discontinuous step, we should revert to the ﬁrst
form of eq. (37) when performing the volume integral
across the interface. Deﬁning ˆn to be the unit normal to
the interface, and noting that B·H = µH 2
n/µ where
the tangential and normal components, Ht and Bn, are
continuous across such an interface, the resulting surface

that the second integral is zero (considering the integral

ume integrals), and that ˆn = ˆr on the interface at r = a.
Therefore, we need only those terms of B2

vary as sin θ or cos θ. Referring to the Appendix, we ﬁnd

[24] Poisson worked exclusively with the magnetic ﬁeld H,
but realized that the force on a ﬁctitious magnetic pole
p is not necessarily F = pH, since poles are always found
inside bulk media, which results in an additional force
on the pole depending on the assumed shape of the sur-
rounding cavity. W. Thomson (Lord Kelvin) noted in
1850 [21] that for a pole in a disk-shaped cavity with
axis parallel to the magnetization M of the medium, the
force would be F = p(H + 4πM), and therefore he intro-
duced the magnetic ﬁeld B = H + 4πM “according to
the electromagnetic deﬁnition”. In sec. 400 of his Treatise
[25], Maxwell follows Thomson in stating that the force
on a magnetic pole is usefully considered to be F = pB.
This is very reasonable since in linear magnetic media
ﬁctitious poles are only found on surfaces, for which an
appropriate surrounding cavity is disk-shaped.

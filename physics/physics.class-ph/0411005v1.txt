Abstract

This paper considers acoustic scattering by and propagation through line and plane arrays of

air-bubbles in liquid media. The self-consistent method is used to derive the eﬀective scattering

function of a single bubble embedded in the arrays, incorporating all multiple scattering processes.

For the line case, an exact result is derived. In the plane array situation, only an approximate

analytic result is possible. Numerical computations have been carried out to show the multiple

scattering eﬀects on wave scattering. It is shown that depending on the distance between bubbles

the resonance peak of a single bubble can either be broadened or narrowed due to multiple

scattering and it shows an oscillatory behavior as the distance changes. Meanwhile, the peak

scattering amplitude is also be either enhanced or reduced. The previously predicted strong

enhancement, however, is not evident. For plane arrays, the usual resonant scattering of a single

bubble in absence of other bubbles can be suppressed by multiple scattering when the distance

between bubbles is suﬃciently small. As the distance increases, the resonant scattering starts to

appear, and the resonance peak position is alternately shifted towards higher and lower values.

Moreover, it is predicted that wave propagation through a plane bubble array can be signiﬁcantly

inhibited in a range of frequencies slightly higher than the natural frequency of a single bubble,

possibly a useful feature for noise screening. The ambiguities in the previous results are pointed

out.

1 Introduction

When propagating through media containing many scatterers, waves will be scattered by each scat-

terer. The scattered wave will be again scattered by other scatterers. Such a process will be repeated

to establish an inﬁnite recursive pattern of rescattering between scatterers, forming a course of multi-

ple scattering. Because of multiple scattering, the overall scattering eﬀect in the system may not be

represented simply by the sum of the eﬀects of individual scatterers in isolation. It has now become

well-known that multiple scattering of waves is responsible for a wide range of fascinating phenomena.

This includes, on large scales, twinkling light in the evening sky, modulation of ambient sound at

ocean surfaces [1], and acoustic scintillation from turbulent ﬂows[2] and ﬁsh schools[3]. On smaller

scales, phenomena such as white paint, random laser[4], electrical resistivity, photonic[5] and sonic

bandgaps[6] in periodic structures also ﬁnd their roots in wave multiple scattering. Even more inter-

esting, perhaps, multiple scattering may lead to a phase transition in wave propagation, that is, due

to multiple scattering propagating waves may be trapped in space and will remain conﬁned in the

neighborhood of initial site until dissipated. In the meantime, individual scatterers shows an amazing

collective behavior; such a collective behavior eﬀectively prevent waves from propagation and yields

the phenomenon of Anderson wave localization[7, 8].

Tremendous eﬀort has been devoted to the study of multiple scattering of waves and a large body

of literature exists (Refer to, for example, the monograph by Ishimaru[9]). The work of Poldy[10],

Lax[11], Waterman et al.[12], Twersky[13], and many others serves as a cornerstone to the subject and

provides various schemes describing multiple scattering processes in a number of situations of interest.

In a series of articles, Foldy and Twersky described the multiple scattering of waves in media containing

arbitrary scatterers by a set of self-consistent equation. If not impossible, the exact solution to such a

set of coupled equations is diﬃcult to obtain. Certain approximations, such as the perturbation series

in the diagrammatic method[15], generally have to be resorted to.

An exact description of multiple scattering is only possible in several simple systems. Multiple

scattering of acoustic waves by a ﬁnite number of air-ﬁlled bubbles in liquids has been one of such rare

systems and poses a useful model system to study wave multiple scattering[14]. A rigorous treatment

of multiple scattering not only provides deﬁnite but also new insight into phenomena associated with

multiple scattering. For example, the recent numerical investigation[7, 8, 16] has shed further light on

the aforementioned phenomenon of wave localization which could not be possibly obtained within the

realm of approximations. Despite the success, however, the research is purely numerical and has been

3

limited to the case of a ﬁnite number of air-bubbles. It would be desirable to explore more complicated

and practical situations involving an inﬁnite number of scatterers and pursue the conditions in which an

analytic description of multiple scattering can be obtained, thus rendering a justiﬁcation of numerical

results extended for inﬁnite scatterers. This article presents one of such attempts.

The problem considered here is multiple scattering of acoustic waves by regular arrays of air-bubbles

in a liquid. Two situations will be deliberated:

linear and planar arrays. It is shown that the two

cases have the closed form solutions. These two simple situations are chosen so as to display the

physical essence in a most explicit form. There are a number of earlier works on these circumstances.

Weston[17] ﬁrst considered the frequency response of air-bubbles forming linear and planar arrays.

Weston derived approximate formulas for sound scattering by an air-bubble embedded in the arrays

and predicted that the line array of air-bubbles behaves like a cylindrical bubble: the sharp sphere

resonance, a well-known feature for a single spherical bubble[18], is suppressed and a broader resonance

at a lower frequency appears. He further showed that a plane array of air-bubbles behaves like a plane

screen of gas - there is no resonance at all. Later, bubbles in linear arrays were further numerically

studied in [19] for the case that the incident wave is perpendicular to the linear axis. In contrast to

Weston, his results indicate that depending on the spacing between bubbles, a line of bubbles need

not necessarily lead to an increase in damping for the ensemble. However, the results in [19] are not

only too limited but are distracted by errors. Tolstoy and Tolstoy[20, 21] also considered line and

plane arrays of air-bubbles. They predicted that pronounced partial resonances can be observed in

both systems. Their results, however, have been questioned[22, 23, 24]. In short, the previous results

are in discrepancy. A deﬁnite and careful investigation is clearly needed.

This paper considers further the problem of line and plane arrays of resonant monopole scatterers

like the air-bubbles. The self-consistent approach from Foldy[10] and Twersky[13] will be followed to

derive a set of coupled equations for which exact analytic solutions are obtained. It will be shown

that the total acoustic scattering by arrays of bubbles can be expressed in terms of the scattering

from individual bubbles. The eﬀects of multiple scattering is represented by an eﬀective scattering

function of a single bubble embedded in the array. Both line and plane line arrays will be considered.

Wherever appropriate, comparison with the previous results will be made. We note that the present

investigation is limited to the linear response of air-bubbles. When the stimulation ﬁeld is too strong,

therefore the interaction between bubbles can be very large, the linear response approximation may

fail.

2 Theory

The problem considered here is illustrated by Figs. 1 and 2. In Fig. 1, a unit plane wave ei~k

~r is incident
·

on a line array of identical air-bubbles. The incident wave makes an angle of θ with the line of the

array. The distance between two neighboring bubbles is d. The bubble radius is taken as a. Fig. 2

shows that the identical bubbles form a square lattice in the x

y plane with lattice constant d. The

−

incident wave is in the direction denoted by θ and φ in the spherical coordinates.

In absence of other bubbles, the scattered wave from a single bubble can be written as

in which p0(~ri) is the incident wave at the bubble located at ~ri and f is the scattering function of

the single bubble.

It has been found numerically[25] that when ka < 0.35, to which the following

discussion is restricted, the scattering function is isotropic and given by

−
where ω0 is the natural frequency of the bubble and δ is the damping factor of the bubble including

−

radiation, thermal exchange, and viscosity eﬀects[Refer to Appendix 6 in Ref. [18]].

When many bubbles are present, the scattered wave from the i-th bubble is a linear response to

the total incident wave and the scattered wave from other bubbles, and therefore can be written as

We deﬁne an eﬀective scattering function for each bubble as

with n being an integer and x′ limited to (0, 2π), then [x] = x′. With (9), Eq. (7) represents the exact

solution. The result in Eq. (9) diﬀers from the previously published result [20] by a factor of √2 in

the logarithm and by the modulo values.

Total scattered ﬁeld. The total scattered wave can be evaluated in the far ﬁeld limit, r >> d with

r being the perpendicular distance from the ﬁeld point to the line. In this limit, the summation in

Eq. (6) can be converted into an integral. The resulting formula is

ps(r) = iπ

where H (1)

0 (x) is the zero-th order type one Hankel function.

With Eq. (7), we see from Eq. (10) that the scattered wave is isotropic in the plane perpendicular to

the line and it depends on the incident angle and on the perpendicular distance. Eq. (10) also indicates

that the scattering by the array is characterized by the eﬀective scattering function of each individual

bubble. This may partially resolve the debate between Tolstoy et al. and Twersky[20, 22, 23, 24].

Tolstoy et al. used the eﬀective scattering function to study the superresonance behavior of a bubble

array. Twersky alternatively deﬁned a scattering amplitude of the whole array and claimed that this

is only observable. He further stated that an individual scattering amplitude is not observable and

numerical computations for an individual scattering function do not represent physically observable

data. Tolstoy et al. argued that the characteristics of a single bubble can be inferred at near ﬁeld.

From the present approach, we see that in the case of an inﬁnite line array, the individual eﬀective

6

6
scattering function does provide useful information and represent observable data at far ﬁeld as well.

In fact, Eq. (10) will be valid as long as r >> d and Nd >> r with N being the total number of the

scatterers. Therefore even for a ﬁnite number of scatterers, the individual scattering function may still

delineate the observables.

1. There are some further approximations in Weston’s derivation. His result is more valid for frequen-

cies signiﬁcantly below the nature frequency of the bubbles.

The energy conservation law requires,

where A denotes the absorption due to the thermal exchange and viscosity:

where ‘Im’ means taking the imaginary part. In deriving Eq. (31), we used the optical theorem[9]. It

can be shown that the approximate result from Eq. (19) satisﬁes the energy conservation law to a few

percentage, hereby providing a justiﬁcation of the approximation.

3 Numerical results

The above theoretical results will be illustrated by numerical examples in this section. We consider

that bubbles arrays are placed in water. The following parameters are used in the computation: the

sound speeds of the air inside the bubble and of the surrounding water are 340 m/s and 1500 m/s,

the mass densities for air and water are 1.29 and 1000 kg/m3 respectively. The thermal and viscosity

coeﬃcients are taken from Appendix 6 in [18].

3.1 Line arrays

In Fig. 3, the scattering strength

of a single bubble from Eq. (7) is plotted versus ka for various

F

|

|

bubble separations, with comparison to the scattering strength of the single bubble in absence of other

bubbles. The incidence is perpendicular to the line. The bubble radius is 1 mm. Figures (b), (d),

9

and (f) are respectively replots of (a), (c), and (e) in the normalized scales, i.e. normalized by the

maximum of the scattering strength. From these ﬁgures, we see that (1) when the separation between

bubbles is small, the multiple scattering heavily suppresses the scattering strength of the single bubble;

(2) the resonance peak is red shifted (shifted towards lower values); (3) the resonance peak can either

broadened or narrowed, depending on the separation; (4) the multiple scattering eﬀects are negligible

when the separation exceeds a certain value.

Fig. 4 plots the eﬀective scattering strength as a function of ka for three incident angles. Here we

see that as the incidence angle deviates from the normal direction, the resonance peak will be further

reduced and the peak position is more shifted towards lower frequencies. The previously predicted

quasi-resonance [21] is not evident. As expected, when the separation is suﬃciently large, the results

reduce to that of a single bubble without the presence of other bubbles.

Fig. 5 plots the relative natural frequency and damping shifts with respect to the case without

multiple scattering as a function of the bubble separation. Two bubble sizes and two incident angles

are assumed. The results are shown to be almost the same for the two bubble sizes. While the

frequency is always shifted to a lower value, the damping shift shows an interesting regular oscillatory

feature. As the incidence is deviated from the normal direction, the oscillation period is reduced. At

certain ranges of bubble separations, the damping is reduced by the multiple scattering, indicating

that the resonance peak is narrowed. The special cases considered in Ref. [19] fall in these ranges.

The relative peak scattering amplitude is plotted as a function of bubble separation in Fig. 6 for

two bubble sizes and two incident angles. Again, the oscillatory features appear, in line with that

shown in Fig. 5. For most separations, the peak amplitude is reduced by multiple scattering.

In

certain ranges of separation, however, the peak scattering strength is enhanced for the larger bubble

case, but not as much as predicted by Tolstoy[21]. For the smaller bubbles, the peak amplitude is

always reduced by multiple scattering. It is worth noting that the thermal and viscosity eﬀects, which

are more important for smaller bubbles, are not considered by Tolstoy. This may explain partially the

discrepancy.

3.2 Plane array

In this situation, only normal incidence is considered. The eﬀective scattering strength

is plotted

F

|

|

against ka for various lattice constants (d/a) in Fig. 7.

In the plots, the dashed lines refer to the

scattering strength of a single free bubble. The multiple scattering eﬀects are stronger than in the

10

line case. As we can see, the resonance scattering of the single bubble is fully suppressed when the

bubbles are closed packed, in agreement with Weston’s results[17]. As the bubble separation increases,

however, the resonance picture starts to appear and the multiple scattering eﬀects decreases.

Consider the cases that the resonant scattering appears. In contrast to the line array case, the

natural frequency is shifted to higher values when the separation is less than certain amount. In some

ranges of separation, the resonance peak is shifted to a lower value slightly. This is shown by Fig. 8 for

bubble radii 1 and 0.1 mm separately. In this ﬁgure, the eﬀects of multiple scattering on the damping

is also presented. For d/a smaller than about 100, the damping is signiﬁcantly increased by multiple

scattering, implying peak broadening. There is a range of bubble separations, however, the damping

is in fact reduced by multiple scattering; this occurs for d/a between 100 and 400.

The relative scattering amplitude at resonance with respect to that of a single free bubble is plotted

versus d/a for two bubble sizes in Fig. 9. Again, an oscillatory property surfaces. The reduction and

enhancement in scattering strength alternate, as the bubble separation varies. The larger the bubble,

the larger is the enhancement factor; it can be as large as 1.4 for a = 1 mm.

We also studied the transmission through the plane array. The transmission coeﬃcient

1 + T

is

|

|

shown in Fig. 10 as a function of ka for four bubble separations for the with and without thermal and

viscosity dissipation. As shown in the plots, the propagation can be signiﬁcantly blocked by the plane

array for frequencies slightly above the resonance of a single free bubble; the vertical bar indicates the

resonance position of the single free bubble. As the separation increases, the range of frequencies in

which the transmission is inhibited decreases, until disappears. Such an inhibition property may be

useful for utilizing bubble layers as a noise screen. The inhibition also play a role in deﬁning acoustic

wave localization in bubbly liquids[16]. When the thermal or viscosity damping is not included, the

transmission is shown to be enhanced at certain bubble separations, as illustrated by Fig. 10(c). This

is against the energy conservation, indicating the failure of the formula (27) in this case.

4 Summary

In summary, we considered acoustic scattering from regular arrays of air-bubbles for low frequencies,

i.e. ka << 1. The self-consistent method is used to derive the eﬀective scattering function of a single

bubble embedded in the arrays, including all multiple scattering processes. The total scattered wave is

expressed in term of this eﬀective scattering function. An exact solution is presented for the case of line

arrays. For the plane arrays, an approximate result is given. The approximation is justiﬁed in view of

11

energy conservation. The numerical results show that depending on the distance between bubbles the

resonance peak of a single free bubble can either be broadened or narrowed due to multiple scattering

and shows an oscillatory feature as the distance is increased. In the same spirit, the peak scattering

amplitude can also be enhanced or reduced. The enhancement is less than the previous prediction.

Furthermore, wave propagation through a plane bubble array can be signiﬁcantly inhibited in a range

of frequencies slightly higher than the natural frequency of a single bubble. The results from this paper

can also be extended to scattering by multiple plane arrays of bubbles.

Figure Captions

Fig. 1 The geometry for a line array of bubbles. The bubble radius is a and the separation between

bubbles is d. The incident wave makes an angle θ with the line array.

Fig. 2 The geometry for a plane array. The array is in the x

y plane and forms a square lattice

−

with constant d. The incident wave makes angles θ and φ in the spherical coordinates. In the

numerical computation, we consider the case that the wave propagates along the z-axis.

Fig. 3 Line array: Scattering and eﬀective scattering strength with respect to a single free bubble

versus frequency for various bubble separations. The bubble radius is 1 mm. Here the notation

f can either refer to the scattering function of a single bubble or the eﬀective scattering function

F of a single bubble embedded in a line array of bubbles.

Fig. 4 Line array: Scattering strength as a function of ka for diﬀerent bubble separations and inci-

dence angles. The bubble radius is 1 mm.

Fig. 5 Line array: Relative frequency and damping shifts as a function of d/a for two bubble sizes and

two incident angles (θ = π/2 and π/4). Here δf is shift in peak position due to multiple scattering

between bubbles, f0 is the resonance frequency of a single bubble in isolation (f0 = ω0/2π).

Fig. 6 Line array: Relative peak scattering amplitude as a function of d/a for two bubble sizes and

two incident angles.

Fig. 7 Plane array: Scattering strength versus frequency for various bubble separations. The bubble

radius is 1 mm. Here the notation f can either refer to the scattering function of a single bubble

or the eﬀective scattering function F of a single bubble embedded in a line array of bubbles.

Fig. 8 Plane array: Relative frequency and damping shifts as a function of d/a for two bubble sizes.

Fig. 9 Plane array: Relative peak scattering amplitude as a function of d/a for two bubble sizes.

Fig. 10 Plane array: Relative transmission versus ka for four bubble separations. Without the plane

array, the transmission is normalized as one.

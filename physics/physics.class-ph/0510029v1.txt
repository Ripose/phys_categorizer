Determining the Spectral Signature of Spatial Coherent Structures

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We applied to an open ﬂow a proper orthogonal decomposition (pod) technique, on 2D snapshots
of the instantaneous velocity ﬁeld, to reveal the spatial coherent structures responsible of the self-
sustained oscillations observed in the spectral distribution of time series. We applied the technique
to 2D planes out of 3D direct numerical simulations on an open cavity ﬂow. The process can easily
be implemented on usual personal computers, and might bring deep insights on the relation between
spatial events and temporal signature in (both numerical or experimental) open ﬂows.

PACS: 07.05.Kf, 07.05.Pj, 05.45.Tp, 47.15.Ki

One of the most challenging questions arising in open
ﬂows such as jets, mixing layers, etc, is to understand the
occurrence and nature of robust and reproducible self-
sustained oscillations revealed in spatially localized time
series, usually velocity or pressure measurements. How
such frequencies appear, and whether or not they might
be the signature of particular coherent spatial patterns,
still remain largely unresolved, although abundantly doc-
umented [1, 2]. Such an understanding may moreover ap-
pear of the upmost importance in control applications, in
that knowing which spatial event is generating such spec-
tral signature may lead to best ﬁtted control scheme with
respect to the required goal. An example is given by ﬂows
over open cavities, like in high speed trains, that generate
very powerful self-sustained oscillations that appear to be
the main source of noise emitted by the train. In that
case, control will be aimed to reduce or even suppress
the source of noise, without reducing the aerodynamic
performances, and at the lowest energetic cost.

In this paper we (i) show in a test case the ability
of the pod technique to associate self-sustained oscilla-
tions to well-identiﬁed spatial coherent structures; (ii)
conﬁrm, as a consequence, the mixing layer origin of the
most energetic self-sustained oscillations in an open cav-
ity ﬂow. We will show that 2D cuts out of the fully
3D ﬂow are suﬃcient to extract signiﬁcant space-time
events out of the ﬂow. We are using for that purpose
a technique based on an empirical decomposition of the
ﬂow, that optimizes a basis of (orthogonal) eigen-modes
with respect to the kinetic energy. The technique is of-
ten known as to the proper orthogonal decomposition
(pod hereafter) in the framework of ﬂuid dynamics [3];
or as the Karhunen-Lo`eve decomposition in the frame-
work of signal processing [4]. (Other denominations ex-
ist, such as empirical orthogonal decomposition, singular
value decomposition, etc, depending on the ﬁeld of ap-
plication considered). To illustrate our point, we applied
the technique to 3D direct numerical simulations of an
air ﬂow over an open cavity [5]. The system is a cavity
of length L = 10 cm along x (the longitudinal direction
along which air is ﬂowing), of depth h = 5 cm (the aspect
ratio L/h is 2), and transverse size l = 20 cm. The cavity

is enclosed into a vein 12 cm high. The ﬂow rate velocity
is U0 = 1.2 m/s (Reynold’s number Re ≃ 8500). Simula-
tions were performed following a ﬁnite volume approach
under an incompressible ﬂow hypothesis. Spatial and
time discretization have a second order precision. The
pressure ﬁeld is given by a Poisson’s equation that re-
quires a projection step, such as to be in agreement with
a non divergent velocity ﬁeld. In order to reduce the CPU
time cost, the spanwise boundary conditions are periodic.
The 256 × 128 × 128 mesh-spatial grid is reﬁned in areas
featuring strong velocity gradients (boundary and shear
layers) — with a mesh varying from 0.7 and 10 mm along
the longitudinal x and vertical y directions, and constant
with about 1.56 mm over the transverse direction z [6].
Here we brieﬂy expose the pod technique we im-
plemented. The goal
is to compute the eigenmodes
{φn(t), ~ψn(~r)} that best ﬁt the coherent structures com-
posing the ﬂow, computed from a data base of M dif-
ferent snapshots of the velocity ﬁeld, in such a way that
any instantaneous snapshot of the data base can be re-
constructed by performing the sum over the eigenmode
basis:

~u(~r, t) =

µnφn(t) ~ψn(~r),

(1)

M

Xn=1

where the λn = µ2
n are the eigenvalues of the decomposi-
tion [3]. Typically M was of the order of 600 frames.
Note that ~u being a vector ﬁeld, ~ψ must also be so;
however we will also use the notation ψ when dealing
with one component of the ﬁeld (usually it will be the
longitudinal component along x). A coherent structure
can now be deﬁned as an eigenmode of a (2-pointwise
linear) correlation matrix built on the data base snap-
shots. There exists mainly two ways of building up a
correlation matrix: either performing a time correlation,
or a space correlation. With snapshots ~u(~r, t) of size
N = Nx × Ny pixels (where Nx ≃ 125 and Ny ≃ 100 are
respectively the snapshot dimensions along x and y), the
space-correlation matrix

is of size 2N 2 (up,q are velocity components). We re-
stricted our analysis to the x,y-components of the veloc-
ity ﬁeld so as to mimic what is available from 2D ex-
perimental PIV snapshots. On the contrary, the time
correlation matrix

C(t, t′) =

~u(~r, t)~u(~r, t′)d~r

Z ZS

is of size M 2 (if M is the number of instant under con-
sideration), much smaller than (2N )2 (3.6 × 104 against
4 × 108). Keeping in mind that no more information can
be extracted from that contained in the data base itself,
and that at most M relevant eigenmodes are therefore
available from the data set, we chose the second way
(based on C(t, t′)), known as the snapshot pod technique
in the literature [8, 9]. Practically, we start with a data
base of M instantaneous spatial snapshots of the velocity
ﬁeld; in experiments they can for example be obtained us-
ing PIV techniques [7]. Then, the data are reshaped into
a “data matrix” A whose column elements are the pixels
of a given snapshot. For that purpose, each 2D snapshot
is reshaped into a column vector (of length N ), by stack-
ing over each other all the columns of the snapshot, from
the ﬁrst to the last. Both x and y components of the (vec-
tor) velocity ﬁeld are further stacked in the same column
following the same procedure, starting with component
x at the top of the column, and then the component y
down to the bottom of the column. The vertical size
of A is therefore 2N . The matrix A contains as many
columns as snapshots in the data base (so that its hori-
zontal dimension is M ), the snapshots being ranked from
the left to the right of A as the time is ﬂowing down. The
matrix A is therefore of dimension M × 2N . The correla-
tion matrix C is next obtained by performing the product
C = At · A, where At is the transposed matrix of A, and
· the usual matrix dot product.
(Note that the space
correlation matrix K is given by K = A · At) Applying
a singular value decomposition procedure on C, we ob-
tain the eigen-modes φn(t), rearranged as columns of a
chronos [9] matrix Φ from left with n = 1 to right with
n = M . The spatial eigenmodes ~ψn(~r) (sometimes called
topos in the literature [9]) are given following Eq.(1) by
φn(t)~u(~r, t)dt. The ~ψn are reshaped into
~ψn(~r) = 1
µn
columns of a topos matrix Ψ = (A · Φ) · D−1/2, follow-
ing the same procedure as A, where D is the diagonal
matrix of the eigenvalues λn, ranked from the largest to
the smallest value. The Matlab c(cid:13) software is dedicated
to matrix operations, so that the whole process of build-
ing A, calculating C, performing the singular decompo-
sition to obtain the φn, and determining the ψn, takes,
for M = 600 and N ≃ 37300 no more than 30 sec on a
usual PC.

locations: 2 within the mixing layer (one upstream, one
downstream), and 2 within the cavity (upstream and
downstream). In each of them clearly appear peaks at
about f0 = 13.5 Hz (Strouhal number St=1.06 when
based on the cavity length L and the reference velocity;
St=0.033 when based on the mixing layer thickness and
the mean velocity — to be compared with the natural
Strouhal number Stn=0.03 of an unforced mixing layer
[2]), and it is now well accepted that this frequency is
produced by the instability of the mixing layer [1]. The
spectral component is recovered anywhere in the cavity,
presumably due to the overall pressure ﬁeld coupling due
to the ﬂuid incompressibility (the Mach number is about
4 × 10−3).

Now we propose to apply our technique so as to iden-
tify the spatial coherent structures ~ψn(~r) of the ﬂow, and
track out their dynamical features from their associated
time-dependent amplitudes φn(t). Note that the snap-
shots here must be sampled at least at 2f0 ≃ 30 Hz if
we want to be time-resolved with respect to f0 (Shannon
criterion). This was actually achieved in the numerical
simulations.

In Fig.2 we clearly see that the pod decomposes the
ﬂow into two well-deﬁned areas: one is the mixing layer
over the cavity, essentially captured by the 2 ﬁrst eigen-
modes ψ1,2, the other is the cavity vortices, captured
by the higher order (less energetic) eigenmodes. The
two ﬁrst modes look very similar, and actually could be
phase squared as expected when the ﬂow is experiencing
a global mean advection (phase squaring resulting in that
case from the space translation invariance) [3]. However,
when comparing the eigenvalues λ1,2 plotted in Fig.3a,
they appear to be rather diﬀerent, and not close to each
other as it should be expected in a phase squaring sit-
uation. Moreover, when plotting chronos φ2(t) vs φ1(t)

(Fig.3b), a torus is drawn whose dispersion cannot be ex-
plained by numerical noise. Henceforth, it rather looks
like if the two ﬁrst modes were not two degenerated phase
aspects of a unique “complex” mode, but really two dif-
ferent pod modes, although somehow coupled (so as to
produce the torus shape of Fig.3b). This invoques a sym-
metry breaking in the ﬂow advection, most likely due to
the downstream corner of the cavity. In the discussion on
whether the instability is convective or absolute, note the
downstream corner location of the two ﬁrst topos ~ψ1,2,
whose amplitude is vanishing in the upstream area. This
is a strong argument in favor of the convective nature
of the instability, the upstream front of the instability

wavepacket being expected to spread back against the
ﬂow advection in an absolutely unstable situation. A
global mode cannot be completely excluded however [2].
In Fig.4 are shown the ﬁve ﬁrst time series φn(t) and
their spectral distribution. We clearly see the occurrence
of the frequency f0 = 13.5 Hz associated with the two
ﬁrst chronos, the corresponding topos featuring the co-
herent structures contained in the mixing layer. Clearly,
the frequency turns out to be associated with the insta-
bility that develops in the mixing layer. While local time
series all produce spectral components at f0 (see Fig.1),
the pod instead is able to overcome this global ﬂow coher-
ence and to selectively associate the spectral components
to the adequate spatial coherent structures. This result

henceforth naturally conﬁrms the mixing layer origin of
the most energetic spectral component.

At this step,

it might be interesting to brieﬂy dis-
cuss some critical points of the technique. First, be-
cause the method is aimed to track out coherent pat-
terns encountered within a ﬂow (coherent with respect
to the point-wise correlation matrices), it is important
for the statistical ﬂow properties to be stationary. As
a consequence, the data set must possess a suﬃciently
important number of independent realizations so as to
ensure the convergence of the decomposition towards the
real pod modes. We have checked that for data set of
less than 400 samples, the third mode fairly mixes both
shear layer and cavity structures, resulting in its time
amplitude fourier spectrum to the occurrence of the 13.5
Hz-peak — strongly weakened here in mode 3 when us-
ing 600 samples. Secondly, from an experimental point
of view, each sample composing the data set should share
identical (statistical) properties; as a consequence, when
directly working on instantaneous snapshots of the ﬂow,
particule feeding should remain homogeneous in time, the
average intensity and coherent structure resolution being
modiﬁed as the feeding is varying — therefore biasing the
statistical representativity of the samples [7]. There are
no systematic test to decide whether statistical conver-
gence has been reached or not. We however plotted in
Fig.5 the average diﬀerence η between two modes with
respect to the number of snapshots contained in the data
set:

Note that we had to deal with the absolute value of the

cyclic global sign inversions from ψp

deep modiﬁcation of the velocity structure. We see from
Fig.5 that convergence is ensured for mode 1 with p ∼ 200
ﬂow realizations.

The study reported here in fact brings another very in-
teresting insight from an experimental point of view. It
indeed shows that, although the velocity ﬁeld is spatially

fully 3D and characterized by 3 components [10], a 2D
pod calculation (performed in a plane), over 2 velocity
components, is able to separate the two intuitive regions
of interest in the ﬂow (namely the mixing layer and the
cavity vortices), which therefore strongly simplify any ex-
perimental protocol, in that a classical PIV (in a plane,
over 2 velocity components) is suﬃcient to track out the
coherent structures and their dynamical features, with-
out having to call upon 3D PIV techniques, much heavier.
We have checked that the results were very similar when
using 1 or 3 velocity components instead of 2. Moreover,
the 3D calculation of the pod modes conﬁrms all the re-
sults provided by the 2D analyses; 2D cuts out of the 3D
modes look very similar to our (intrinsically) 2D modes,
and their amplitude spectral distribution are comparable
as well (see [10]).

In conclusion, a pod technique has been applied with
success to discriminate the relevant dynamical features of
the coherent structures present in the ﬂow over an open
cavity. The processing time revealed to be of the order
of 30 s for about 600 samples of size 37300 pixels, and
grew up to 11 min when applied to about 300 experimen-
tal PIV samples of size 241.800 pixels (N = 260 × 465).
However, in most experimental applications, the whole
ﬁeld resolution, or the whole picture area, are not re-
quired to get the expected results, and it is expected
that the technique could eﬃciently be applied to a panel
of other open ﬂows presenting self-sustained oscillations.

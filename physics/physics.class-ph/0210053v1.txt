Response to Compagno and Persico∗

Abstract
Some mathematically incorrect claims of Compagno and Persico in their reply (2002 J. Phys.
A: Math. Gen. 35 8965) to my comment on their recent paper on self-dressing and radiation
reaction in classical electrodynamics are pointed out.

Compagno and Persico (CP) have replied [1] to my comment [2] on their paper on self-
dressing and radiation reaction in classical electrodynamics [3]. CP acknowledge the main
point of the comment, namely that the expression for the time-averaged electromagnetic self-
force obtained in [4] for the test charge of a Bohr–Rosenfeld ﬁeld-measurement procedure
and rejected in [5] as incorrect can be obtained also using a formula for the self-force which
they derived by diﬀerent means in [3]. In view of this fact, CP now endorse the expression
in question as correct. However, some claims in their reply call for my response.

The expression for the time-averaged self-force on a spherical uniform charge q of radius

a obtained in [4] reads

¯F =

f (t′) = −

.

Here, the speed of light c = 1 and Q(t) is the charge’s one-dimensional trajectory, which
is subject to the conditions that Q(t) = 0 outside the time interval (0, T ), |Q(t)| ≪ a,
and |dQ(t)/dt| ≪ c; Θ(x) is the Heaviside step function. Instead of the simple closed-form
expression (2) for the function f (t′), CP counter-proposed in [5] the expression (normalized
here to conform with (2):

f (t′) = −

(The above closed-form expression for hrn−1i was given subsequently in [6].) My ﬁrst point
here has to be unfortunately of a rather trivial nature. The sign of expression (3) is correct,
if, as in the standard notation of elementary calculus, u(n)[v(x)] ≡ dnu(y)/dyn|y=v(x). Thus,
e.g., δ(n)(T − t) ≡ dnδ(x)/dxn|x=T −t. With this notation, there is no sign misprint in
the function f (t′) in [5] that CP now want to correct—but if δ(n)(T − t) meant instead
dnδ(T − t)/dtn = (−1)ndnδ(x)/dxn|x=T −t, as CP suggest, then not only the sign but also
the factor (−1)n would be there in error.
In either case, the function f (t′) is now given
incorrectly by the expression (3) of [1]—it either has a wrong overall sign, or the factor
(−1)n is superﬂuous there.

Contrary to an assertion of CP, I have never claimed that the expression (3) for the
function f (t′) is incorrect.
I have rather pointed out in [6] that, in order to obtain the
time-averaged self-force (1), this expression was used incorrectly by CP in the requisite
integration. Since this is an integration with ﬁnite limits involving high-order derivatives of
the delta function, it cannot be performed as simplistically as CP have done, obtaining

This is the ‘exact’ expression for the time-averaged self-force ¯F that CP still claim in [1] to be
correct, despite the fact that it cannot be consistent with their newly adopted endorsement of
the expression (2) for the function f (t′), as using this expression it can be shown immediately
that

For example, when the trajectory Q(t) is such that Q(n)(T ) = Q(n)(0), n ≥ 1, as for the
trajectory Q(t) = Q[1 − cos(2πt/T )], Q = const used as an illustration in [6], the right-hand
side of (6) identically vanishes, while the left-hand side obviously does not. The omission of
one of the two terms in (5) will not ‘ﬁx’ that formula. This can be easily seen again on the
example Q(t) = Q[1 − cos(2πt/T )], for which

where τ = T or 0. This would give a completely diﬀerent shape for the time-averaged self-
force ¯F as a function of T than that displayed for this trajectory in ﬁgure 1 of [6], obtained
there using equations (1) and (2), and the Taylor expansion of the trajectory about the
initial instant t = 0 (a direct numerical integration in (1) of the trajectory multiplied by the
function (2) will also prove this point).

All this demonstrates the fact that far from being ‘convenient’ for an ‘exact’ evaluation
of the time-averaged self-force ¯F , formula (3) is a purely formal expression that has no
practical application in an integration with ﬁnite limits.
Its use by CP has led to the
erroneous expression (5) for ¯F ; when CP use it in [1] to prove the equivalence of expressions

performing the ﬁnite-limit integration.

So far, CP have responded to my criticism [4] of their re-analysis [7] of the Bohr–Rosenfeld
ﬁeld-measurement procedure only by making mathematically incorrect claims. All these
involved rather simple mathematical points about which there should have been no need
of explicating since my paper [6] of 2000 (where I derived expression (2) using elementary
calculus of the delta function), if not already since my paper [4] of 1999 (where I used Fourier
transform methods). It is regrettable that such points have deﬂected from the interesting
issues of physics relating to the famous Bohr–Rosenfeld analysis.

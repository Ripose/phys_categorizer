It is proved that in classical electrodynamics the uniform rectilinear mo-
tion of charged ”rigid” sphere with self-action (Sommerfeld model) is stable.

03.50.De

In classical electrodynamics long time ago in Sommerfeld works [1, see also
2] was derived the expression of self-force acting on ”nonrelativistically rigid
charged sphere”, i.e sphere with radius a, its center moving along trajectory
~R(t), with total charge Q and charge density (in laboratory reference frame)

ρ(t, ~r) =

Q
4πa2 δ(|~r − ~R| − a)

.

In the case of shell rectilinear motion this force has the form

here cT ± = 2a ± L±, L± = |R(t) − R(t − T ±)|, L = |R(t) − R(t − T )|.

The total shell equation of motion then will be

This equation has one trivial solution - the uniform motion without radi-

ation:

For linear analysis of stability of this solution let us take

R(t) = R0 + vt

R(t) = R0+vt+δ(t), R(t−T ) = R0+v(t−T )+δ(t−T ), L = vT +δ(t)−δ(t−T ),

here δ(t) - small perturbation.

Then in linear approximation the self-force (1) reads

here q = pa/c, x± = 2
Dividing q into real and imaginary parts:

1∓β , A2 = (rcl/a) · (1/(2γ3β3)), β 6= 1.

we split eq.(8) into two:

η2 − w2 = −A2

· [ηx + exp (−ηx) cos (wx)]

Equations (9) are invariant under transformations w → −w, so both signs of
w are solutions, thus further we can take w as positive quantity.

Integrand in (9b) one can divide into two functions:

f1 =

x − 2
x3

and

f2 = [xw − exp (−ηx) sin (wx)]

Intergal of f1 over x between limits x± has zero value; f2 - is positive function
with positive derivative for η, w > 0 and x > 0. Thus for these values of η and
w the intergal of f1 · f2 is positive and the sign of R.H.S. is negative. But this
result contradicts with the sign of L.H.S., which is positive for η > 0, w > 0.
Consequently the equations (9) have solutions only for negative values of the
real part η of q.

This proves that the uniform rectilinear motion of Sommerfeld charged

sphere with β < 1 is stable!

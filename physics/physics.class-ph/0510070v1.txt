ABSTRACT. The concept of gauge invariance in classical electrody-
namics assumes tacitly that Maxwell’s equations have unique solutions.
By calculating the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a moving particle both in
Lorenz and in Coulomb gauge and directly from the ﬁeld equations we
obtain, however, contradicting solutions. We conclude that the tacit
assumption of uniqueness is not justiﬁed. The reason for this failure
is traced back to the inhomogeneous wave equations which connect the
propagating ﬁelds and their sources at the same time.

Introduction

W. Engelhardt

“The principle of gauge invariance plays a key role in the standard model,
which describes electroweak and strong interactions of elementary parti-
cles.” This statement is quoted from an article by J. D. Jackson and L. B.
Okun [1] which emphasizes the importance of the principle and delineates
its historical evolution. The concept emerged from classical electrody-
namics where the electromagnetic ﬁeld expressed in terms of potentials:
~E = −∇φ − ∂ ~A/c ∂t, ~B = rot ~A does not change under the transforma-
tion: ~A → ~A + ∇χ, φ → φ − ∂χ/c ∂t. Since div ~A → div ~A + ∆χ and χ
is an arbitrary function, the divergence of the vector potential can seem-
ingly be chosen arbitrarily without inﬂuencing the ﬁelds. This feature
was exploited to de-couple Maxwell’s inhomogeneous equations by either
choosing div ~A + ∂φ/c ∂t = 0 (Lorenz3 gauge) or div ~A = 0 (Coulomb
gauge). The solution for the ﬁelds should be entirely independent of this
choice.

There is, however, a tacit assumption behind the formalism of elec-
trodynamic gauge invariance: Maxwell’s equations must have unique so-
lutions, otherwise it is meaningless to talk about potentials from which
ﬁelds may be derived. In reference [1] it is said: “It took almost a cen-
tury to formulate this nonuniqueness of potentials that exists despite
the uniqueness of the electromagnetic ﬁelds.” To our knowledge it was
never attempted to prove that the electromagnetic ﬁeld resulting from
a solution of Maxwell’s equations is actually unique, it was just taken
for granted. If there were no unique solution of Maxwell’s linear system
of ﬁrst order ﬁeld equations, gauge transformations on (nonexisting) po-
tentials would be irrelevant.

In this paper we start with the usual assumption that unique solu-
tions of Maxwell’s equations do exist and try to calculate them both
with the help of potentials (Sections 2 - 4) and directly from the ﬁeld
equations (Section 5). For the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a moving parti-
cle we ﬁnd, however, contradicting solutions depending on the method
used. In Section 6 we show that the standard Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁelds,
which satisfy Maxwell’s source-free equations, cannot be considered as a
unique solution of Maxwell’s inhomogeneous equations. Thus, we infer
that the tacit assumption concerning the existence of unique solutions is
not justiﬁed in general.

3In [1] it is pointed out that Ludwig Valentin Lorenz published more than 25 years
before Hendrik Antoon Lorentz what is commonly known as the “Lorentz condition”.
To give proper credit to Lorenz we use in this paper the term “Lorenz gauge”.

Gauge Invariance

The reason for this failure is discussed in Section 8 where we come to
the conclusion that the mixture of elliptic and hyperbolic equations, as
formulated by Maxwell, does not permit a physical solution for moving
point sources.

2 The electromagnetic ﬁeld of a moving particle calculated in

Lorenz gauge

The electromagnetic ﬁeld produced by a moving particle is calculated [2]
from Maxwell’s equations:

div ~E = 4 π ρ

rot ~E = −

1
c

∂ ~B
∂t

div ~B = 0

rot ~B =

ρ ~v +

4 π
c

1

∂ ~E

where ρ is the charge density located in a narrow region round a center
moving with velocity ~v. The total charge of the particle is the integral
over all space:

ρ (~x

, t) d3x

= e

The usual method to solve equations (1-4) is to adopt the potential
ansatz:

~E = −

Z Z Z

which satisﬁes automatically equations (2) and (3) and leads to two
second order diﬀerential equations:

The freedom in the choice of the divergence of the vector potential
is exploited to de-couple equations (7) and (8). Adopting the Lorenz
condition:

one obtains two wave equations of the same structure:

3 Solution in Coulomb gauge

The ﬁelds as given by (21) must be the same when they are calculated
in Coulomb gauge by adopting the condition:

div ~A = 0

Equations (7) and (8) become:

∆φ = − 4 π ρ

The vector ~r = ~x−~x ′ (t) denotes now the simultaneous distance between
charge and ﬁeld point. The ﬁrst term on the right-hand-side of (26) yields
a contribution to the vector potential which is identical with (19):

Since (27) yields already the magnetic ﬁeld as given by (21), the
contribution (31) must vanish which is not likely to occur: The ﬁnite
cross-product is to be integrated with diﬀerent weight, so that both
terms in (31) cannot vanish simultaneously. Furthermore, the condition
for identical electric ﬁelds in Coulomb and in Lorenz gauge:

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

∇φLW = ∇φC +

∂ ~AC2
∂t

(32)

where φLW denotes the potential (18), cannot be satisﬁed, if (28) is not
an irrotational ﬁeld. Even if the second term in (32) could be written
as a gradient: ∂ ~AC2/c ∂t = ∇φ2, the condition: φLW = φC + φ2 + const
would still be violated, since ∂ ~AC2/∂t, and thereby φ2, would depend
on the acceleration according to (28), which is not the case for φLW nor
φC .

In order to quantify these qualitative considerations the integral (28):

The integral vanishes both at R = 0 and at R = ∞.
It is singular
at R = z/ (1 − β) , θ = π. Close to the singularity we expand it by

Obviously, the integral assumes no deﬁnite value when we go to the
limits ǫ1 = ǫ2 = 0 , as it does not converge absolutely.

undeﬁned terms a diverging contribution:

which is also encountered when we calculate (31).

From these results we must conclude that Maxwell’s equations do not
yield a physical solution for the ﬁelds of a moving particle in Coulomb
gauge. Furthermore, the undeﬁned ﬁelds as derived from (25), (27) and
(28) by using (6) disagree deﬁnitely with the ﬁelds as given by (21) in
Lorenz gauge which are well deﬁned. Similar conclusions were reached
by Onoochin [3] without evaluating the integral (33) explicitly.

Jackson has attempted [4] to ﬁnd an approximate ‘quasistatic’ so-
lution in Coulomb gauge which should be valid for velocities v ≪ c in
a region very close to the particle where retardation may be neglected.
We discuss this attempt in Appendix A and show that it also leads to
an inconsistency.

In a recent paper [6] Hnizdo has given a solution of (26) which is
based on the gauge function as deﬁned in equation (66) below in Section
7, and on the formal solution (67) for the gauge function. The second
formal solution (70) is ignored in this consideration. Hnizdo arrives at
a similar result as we found in (40), but he establishes uniqueness by
applying a regularization procedure which can hardly be justiﬁed from
a mathematical point of view. We discuss his approach in Appendix B.

4 Helmholtz’s ansatz

Having obtained contradicting solutions in Lorenz gauge and in Coulomb
gauge we infer that Maxwell’s equations contain an inconsistency which
does not permit to ﬁnd a unique solution for the ﬁelds.
In order to
trace this problem, we employ Helmholtz’s theorem which states that
any vector ﬁeld may be expressed as the sum of a rotational and an
irrotational ﬁeld. This was already used in the ansatz (6). Now we
apply it to the electric ﬁeld:

~E = rot ~U − ∇φ , div ~U = 0

(42)

10

W. Engelhardt

Substituting this into (2) we obtain:

∆~U =

Taking the rotation of (4) and inserting (42) yields a second Poisson

where we have added the Coulomb ﬁeld which results from insertion of

with the ﬁelds as calculated in Sections 2 and 3, because the ﬁelds derived
from the Helmholtz ansatz (42) depend on the second time derivative of
the velocity. Assuming a constant velocity of the particle one could also
show that the integrals (48) and (49) actually diverge.

5 Direct solution of the ﬁeld equations

The two types of potential ansatz (6) and (42) resulted in diﬀerent so-
lutions for the ﬁelds. We, therefore, want to calculate the ﬁelds directly
from (1 - 4) without using any potential ansatz. By elimination of the
electric and the magnetic ﬁeld, respectively, we ﬁnd the wave equations:

∆ ~B −

∂2 ~E
∂t2 =

(ρ ~v) + 4 π ∇ρ

4 π
c2
By applying the standard method of solving this kind of wave equation,
as it was described in Section 2, it can be shown that the ensuing solution
of (50) and (51) yields exactly the ﬁelds as given by (21). However, by
deriving the hyperbolic equations (50) and (51) we have ignored the fact
that Maxwell’s equations are actually a mixture of hyperbolic and elliptic
equations which became very obvious in the previous Section. In order
to take this into account we split the electric ﬁeld into its irrotational
and its rotational part:

(51)

~E = ~Eg + ~Er

The rotational part does not enter equation (1). The irrotational part is
just the quasistatic Coulomb ﬁeld which does not propagate:

~Eg =

, ~r = ~x − ~x

The rotational part obeys the wave equation:

Adding (53) one obtains the electric ﬁeld as it was derived in Section
3 in Coulomb gauge, whereas the retarded solution of (50) yields the
magnetic ﬁeld as it was derived in Section 2 in Lorenz gauge. It was

12

W. Engelhardt

shown in Section 3 that the integral (55) diverges. Hence, it does not
represent a physical solution for the rotational part of the electric ﬁeld.

This analysis shows that the inconsistency inherent to Maxwell’s
equations is not an artefact produced by employing a potential ansatz.
It seems to result from the mixture of hyperbolic and elliptic diﬀerential
equations for the ﬁelds, as they were formulated by Maxwell. Only in
Lorenz gauge the elliptic equations are completely removed so that there
is seemingly agreement between the solutions of the hyperbolic equations
(50) and (51) and the hyperbolic potential equations (10) and (11).

6 The inhomogeneous wave equations for a moving point

source

The discrepancies encountered in Sections 3 - 5 are apparently related
to the fact that Maxwell’s set of equations mixes hyperbolic and elliptic
structures so that unique solutions are not possible. In view of this ﬁnd-
ing it is somewhat surprising that in Lorenz gauge the elliptic features
seem to be removed altogether so that equations (10) and (11) yield the
unique solutions (18) and (19), provided the advanced solutions are sup-
pressed on physical grounds. A closer look at the inhomogeneous wave
equation (10) reveals, however, that the elliptic character is still there,
but concealed in the inhomogeneity. If it is brought out, it turns out
that the solution (18) cannot be considered as unique.

In order to see this we employ a diﬀerent method of solution than
that used in Section 2. Due to the linearity of (10) one may split the
potential into two contributions:

The wave equation may then be split into a Poisson equation:

φ = φ0 + φ1

∆φ0 = −4 π ρ

and into another wave equation:

∆φ1 −

This integral depends on the acceleration which is not the case for the
potential (18). At constant velocity the integral is very similar to (33)
and we know from the calculation in Section 3 that it has no deﬁned
limiting value according to (40).

Similar considerations apply to the inhomogeneous wave equation

by applying the same method of splitting the vector potential into two
parts. If result (61) is substituted into (6), the ﬁelds would depend on
the third derivative of the velocity, which is not the case according to
(21), so that (61) is incompatible with (19).

We must conclude then that the potentials (56) and (61) disagree
with the Li´enard-Wiechert potentials (18) and (19) which turn out not
to be a unique solution of the inhomogeneous wave equations (10) and
(11), even if the advanced solutions are suppressed. As a matter of fact,
equations (10) and (11) have no physical solution judged from our results
(60) and (61) which do not admit a deﬁned limiting value.

There is a direct way of showing that the Li´enard-Wiechert result,
which leads to the ﬁelds (21), satisﬁes only Maxwell’s homogeneous equa-
tions, but the inhomogeneities are not taken into account properly. Let

The surface integral on the left-hand-side vanishes at inﬁnity both for
the Coulomb and for the Lorenz potential so that the volume integral
over all space on the right-hand-side must vanish as well. Substituting
the Coulomb potential (25) together with (23) one obtains an integral
equation which must be satisﬁed by the charge density:

Both integral equations (63) and (64) cannot be satisﬁed by the same
function ρ (r), unless the ‘shape’ of the point charge would depend on
the velocity, as suggested by Onoochin in Reference [3].

7 Transformation of the Lorenz potentials into Coulomb po-

tentials

From the results obtained in Sections 2 - 6 it should be evident by now
that a unique gauge transformation, which transforms the Lorenz poten-
tials of a point source into the corresponding Coulomb potentials, cannot

Gauge Invariance

exist. We ﬁnally want to show this explicitly. The gauge transformation
is eﬀected by a generating function χ:

φC = φL −

∂χ (~x, t)

,

~AC = ~AL + ∇χ (~x, t)

By integrating the ﬁrst relation over time one obtains immediately:

χ (~x, t) =

c (φL − φC ) dt + χ0 (~x)

(67)

where the Lorenz potential is given by (18) and the Coulomb potential
by (25). The gauge function must also satisfy the Poisson equation:

∆χ (~x, t) = div ~AC − div ~AL

(68)

(69)

(70)

which follows from the second relation in (66). Equation (68) has the
instantaneous solution:

where we have substituted the conditions (9) and (22) into (68). If we

tiation rule in (20), we ﬁnd:

As this expression depends not only on the velocity, but also on the
acceleration, it is not compatible with expression (67). Furthermore, the
integral (70) has no unique limiting value, but depends on the chosen
integration variables. In order to see this we assume a constant velocity.
The Li´enard-Wiechert potential (18) becomes in this case:

which is equivalent to shifting the origin of the coordinate system to the

Apart from a common logarithmic singularity at inﬁnity the integrals
(72) and (73) are conditionally convergent and assume diﬀerent limiting
values which was veriﬁed by calculating them in spherical coordinates.
Numerical calculations of (72) and (73) in cylindrical coordinates yield
still diﬀerent limiting values. None of these results agrees with (67).

In accordance with the previous conclusions reached in this paper we
infer that no unique function χ exists which would transform the Lorenz
potentials of a point source into the corresponding Coulomb potentials.
Hence, the principle of ‘gauge invariance’ is not applicable to classical
electrodynamics.

8 Discussion

The nature of the inconsistencies encountered in Sections 2 - 5 is appar-
ently connected to the feature of Maxwell’s equations of mixing elliptic
and hyperbolic structures. Even if the equations are reduced to wave
equations like (10) and (11) or (50) and (51), the elliptic character is
still there in form of the inhomogeneity and may be made visible by the
method of solution employed in Section 6. There we were compelled
to conclude that the inhomogeneous wave equation does not have, as a
matter of fact, a unique solution, or even leads to unphysical diverging
solutions, at least in case of a moving point source. In principle, it is well
known that the inhomogeneous wave equation has an inﬁnite manifold

Gauge Invariance

17

of solutions, but it is generally believed that suppression of the advanced
solutions reduces it to a physical solution, the properties of which are
uniquely determined by the behaviour of the source. According to our
analysis in Section 6 we must maintain, however, that the inhomoge-
neous wave equations do not correctly describe the physical process of
wave production by a moving point source.

Our result is not too surprising, if we realize that the inhomoge-
neous wave equations (50) and (51) relate the measurable ﬁelds at a
certain location with temporal changes in a remote source at the same
time. Although both the ﬁelds and the sources in equations (1 - 4) were
diﬀerentiated at time t when, e.g., the electric ﬁeld was eliminated to
obtain (50), the retarded solutions (21) require that the diﬀerentiation
of the sources is dated back to the earlier time t − R/c. However, the
source may be an extinguished star the light of which we see only now
at time t. It makes no sense to diﬀerentiate a source not existing any
more which has no inﬂuence whatsoever on the light we see after a bil-
lion years. When we diﬀerentiate Maxwell’s equations now to obtain
the wave equations for the ﬁelds, we treat the temporal changes in the
sources as if they would happen now at time t. In the retarded solu-
tions, however, we date back the change in the sources to a remote past.
This procedure is inconsistent, but inescapable due to the structure of
Maxwell’s equations.

If the same procedure would be applied to acoustic waves, one would
encounter similar inconsistencies. Instead, from the hydrodynamic equa-
tions one derives linearized homogeneous wave equations for the pressure
and the ﬂuid velocity. These are solved by imposing suitable boundary
conditions which are determined, e.g., by the oscillating membrane of a
loudspeaker. Maxwell’s equations, however, lead to inhomogeneous wave
equations which connect the travelling ﬁelds with the source at the same
time, a contradictio in adjecto. This became quite obvious in Section
5 where equation (51) predicts that the total electric ﬁeld is produced
in a point-like region and travels within a ﬁnite time to the ﬁeld point
where an observer may be placed. On the other hand, equation (53)
predicts that part of the ﬁeld has already arrived there instantaneously,
as soon as any change in the source occurred. This inconsistency cannot
be resolved without altering equations (1 - 4).

It is well possible that Maxwell was fully aware of this problem,
because in his ‘Treatise’ [7] he did not derive an inhomogeneous wave
equation. He used the Coulomb gauge and derived equation (24). Then

18

he argued that in the ‘ether’ there does not exist any current or free
charge. This way he was left with:

∆ ~A −

1
c2

∂2 ~A
∂t2 =

1
c

∂
∂t

∇φ , ∆φ = 0

Now he committed a formal inconsistency by concluding that the van-
ishing of the Laplacian of the scalar potential justiﬁes to omit also the
gradient of the potential. This is, of course, not true close to a charged
In other words, he omitted part of the ‘displacement current’,
body.
which was invented by him in the ﬁrst place, in order to ‘derive’ a ho-
mogeneous wave equation for the vector potential. At last he suggested
that this equation should be solved by imposing Cauchy-type boundary
conditions on ~A and ∂ ~A/∂t. The result would be a travelling vector
wave from which the measurable ﬁelds could be derived with (6) at
any place and time where the wave has arrived.
In his last Chapter
XXIII (Article 862) Maxwell discusses Riemann’s inhomogeneous wave
equation which is formally the same as Lorenz’s equation (10). Taking
reference to Clausius he states that Riemann’s formula is not in agree-
ment with “the known laws of electrodynamics”. Maxwell’s method of
using only a homogeneous wave equation to describe electromagnetic
waves is still in practical use, when the radiation emitted by an antenna
is calculated. Only the homogeneous wave equation is used together
with plausible boundary conditions resulting from a physics which goes
beyond Maxwell’s equations.

In parentheses we remark that Einstein gave his famous paper of
1905 the title: “Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K¨orper”, but the ‘moving
bodies’ which carry charges and currents are not treated in his analysis.
He deals only with Maxwell’s homogeneous equations which do not lead
to contradictions. The instantaneous Coulomb potential is left out of
the consideration.

For slowly varying ﬁelds Maxwell’s equations do make sense. They
describe correctly the phenomenon of induction in transformers where
only the instantaneous ﬁelds come into play and where the displacement
current is negligible. When a condenser is charged up, the displace-
ment current must be allowed for, but then it is only the instantaneous
Coulomb ﬁeld which matters in practice. A quasistatic ‘near ﬁeld’ the-
ory can be carried through satisfactorily, but amalgamating it with wave
phenomena, in the way Maxwell has tried it, leads to the contradictions

which we have demonstrated. These were also recognized by Dunn [8],
but not worked out in detail.

Close to the charge and at small velocity v ≪ c the second term may
be expected to be negligibly small so that the ﬁrst integral could be
considered as an approximate solution of (A1) with limited applicability.
This attempt to obtain a ‘quasistatic’ solution was pursued by Jack-
son [4] in order to ﬁnd the interaction Lagrangian between two particles
moving at nonrelativistic velocities. He chose a coordinate system cen-
tered at ~x ′ = 0 and performed a partial integration:

It turns out, however, that the solution (A.4) does not satisfy the

The distance vector ~x pointing from the origin to the ﬁeld point may

the ﬁrst term yields a δ - function:

which remains unaccounted for in (A.1).

The reason for the discrepancy is that the ﬁrst integral in (A.2) does
not converge absolutely, as we have shown in Section 3. Consequently,
the operations of partial integration as well as interchanging the sequence
of diﬀerentiation and integration in (A.3) are not permitted and lead to
an incorrect result. The ﬁrst integral in (A.2) has, in fact, no deﬁned
limiting value as is obvious from expression (40).

In a private communication Professor Jackson explained how he
could obtain (A5) from an expansion procedure applied on the Li´enard-
Wiechert potential - which is based on the Lorenz gauge - and that this
was actually being done by Darwin who derived (A.5) in 1920 [5].

Appendix B

Hnizdo’s article Potentials of a uniformly moving point charge in the
Coulomb gauge [6] was apparently motivated by Onoochin’s objections
against ‘mainstream’ electrodynamics as published in Ref. [3]. Onoochin
reached conclusions which are similar to those arrived at in the present
paper, namely that the electrodynamic ﬁeld depends on the choice of the
gauge. He speculates that the ‘shape’ of the electron could depend on its
velocity, an idea which was already pursued (unsuccessfully) by Lorentz.
Hnizdo tries to resolve the problem by using a certain regularization
procedure when the integral (33) is evaluated.

Gauge Invariance

21

Both authors do not emphasize that this type of integral is condition-
ally convergent. This property may lead to the known fact that the value
of the integral depends on the sequence of integration, on the chosen co-
ordinate system, or on the position of the origin. A typical example is
given in Bronstein-Semendjajew’s Taschenbuch der Mathematik, Verlag
Harri Deutsch, Frankfurt, on page 347:

(B.1)

π

π
4

The result depends on whether one integrates ﬁrst over x and then over
y, or vice versa. Although one obtains a ﬁnite result in both cases, its
value is not unique.

Hnizdo uses the formal solution (67) to obtain his formulas (16 -
18) for the diﬀerence between the vector potentials in Coulomb and in
Lorenz gauge. He claims that these formulae do not have singularities,
but this is actually not true. The y-component for the diﬀerence is, e.g.:

ACy − ALy = −

(VC − VL)

(B.2)

c
v

y (x − v t)
y2 + z2

If this expression is expanded around the point
(x = v t + ǫ1 , y = 0 + ǫ2 , z = 0 + ǫ3), one obtains:

ACy − ALy = −

(VC − VL)

(B.3)

c
v

ǫ2 ǫ1
2 + ǫ2
ǫ2
3

This result is similar to our result (40) where we concluded that no
limiting value exists. In fact, (B.3) can assume any value between zero
and inﬁnity depending on the way how one approaches the limits ǫ1 →
0, ǫ2 → 0, ǫ3 → 0.

Hnizdo avoids the ambiguity by using a regularization procedure as
deﬁned in his equation (32). It amounts to using spherical coordinates
centered around the charge point. This prescription is, however, arbi-
trary and lacks a rigorous justiﬁcation. If one deviates from it, one ﬁnds
non-uniqueness as demonstrated in our comparison of equations (72) and
(73). It should be noted that Hnizdo’s regularization would not work,
when applied to the expression (70) for the gauge function which is in-
compatible with (67). This demonstrates again that Maxwell’s equations
do not have a unique solution (for moving point charges) representing a
measurable well deﬁned ﬁeld.

The author is deeply indebted to Dr. O. Kardaun for extensive and
stimulating discussions of the subject. In particular, he pointed out that
the vector potential in Coulomb gauge leads to a conditionally convergent
integral. He also pointed to the mixed character of Maxwell’s equations
involving elliptic and hyperbolic equations.

A communication with Professor J. D. Jackson in October 2001 was

very useful for clarifying the issue dealt with in Appendix A.

Critical previous comments by Professor D. Pﬁrsch and Dr. R. Gru-
ber helped to formulate the paper more concisely than originally con-
ceived. Professor Pﬁrsch’s written comments, in particular, alluded to
the possibility that a gauge transformation between Lorenz and Coulomb
potentials might not exist, as discussed in Section 7.

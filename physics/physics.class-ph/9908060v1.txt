The standart ohmic measurements by means of two extra
leads contain an additional thermal correction to resistance.
The current results in heating(cooling) at ﬁrst(second) sam-
ple contact due to Peltier eﬀect. The contacts temperatures
are diﬀerent. The measured voltage is the sum of the ohmic
voltage swing and Peltier eﬀect induced termopower which
is linear on current. As a result, the thermal correction to
resistance measured exists at I → 0. The correction should
be in comparison with ohmic resistance. Above some critical
frequency dependent on thermal inertion eﬀects the thermal
correction dissapears.

PACS numbers: 72.20.Pa

As well known the ohmic measurements (Fig.1) are
carrying out at low current density in order to prevent
heating. Usually, the only Joule heat is considered to
be important. We recall, in contrast to Joule heat, the
Peltier and Thomson eﬀects are linear on current. The
crucial point of the present paper is that the linear on
current Peltier eﬀect inﬂuences the ohmic measurements
and results in the correction to resistance measured. It’s
well known that the one of the sample contacts is heated
while the another one is cooled due to current induced
Peltier eﬀect. The temperature gradient established is
proportional to current. In this case the Thomson heat
is proportional to second power on current, hence, could
be neglected. Finally, the voltage swing across the cir-
cuit includes Peltier eﬀect induced thermopower which is
linear on current. Accordingly, there exists the thermal
correction to ohmic resistance of the sample.

Let us ﬁrst consider an isotropic(or of cubic symme-
try) conductor which can be in the thermodynamic non-
equilibrium with respect to conducting electrons. In gen-
eral, for inhomogeneous conductor the current density, j
,and energy ﬂux density, q, are given by the following
equations [1].

Here, σ is the conductivity, α is the thermopower, κ is
the thermal conductivity. For an inhomogeneous con-
ductor the electrochemical potential, φ = ϕ + µ/e , is the
sum of the electric potential, ϕ, and chemical potential,
µ, of the conducting electrons. Note, for homogeneous
conductor the above deﬁnition of the potential results in
an additional unimportant constant to ϕ, therefore, the
ϕ, coincides with
average microscopic electric ﬁeld,

where Q is the total amount of heat, evolved per unit
time and volume of the conductor. The current ﬂow is
accompanied by both the Joule and Tomson heats which
are proportional to the second(ﬁrst) power of current re-
spectively. Using Eqs.(1-4) one should ﬁnd the potential,
φ(r) , and temperature, T (r) , for the conductor under
given boundary conditions.

We now consider the thermal eﬀects in connection with
ohmic measurements (see Fig.(1)) of a conductor resis-
tance. The current carrying conductor is connected by
means of two identical extra leads to the current source
(not shown). We assume that both contacts are ohmic
ones. Then, α, σ, κ, the length, l, and the conductor
cross-section, S, are diﬀerent for the leads and the sam-
ple. The voltage is measured between the open ends (”c”
and ”d”) being kept at temperature, T0 , of an external
thermal reservoir. In general, the contacts (”a” and ”b”)
could be at diﬀerent temperatures Ta and Tb respectively.
As well known the Peltier heat is generated by the
current crossing the contact of two diﬀerent conductors.
At the contact( let say ”a” in Fig.(1)) the temperature
T , the electrochemical potential φ, the normal compo-
nents of the current I = jS and the total energy ﬂux
qS , are all continuous. Then, there exists the diﬀer-
α2, of thermopowers. For ∆α > 0
ence, ∆α = α1 −
the charge intersecting the contact ”a” gains the energy
e∆αTa. Consequently, Qa = I∆αTa is the amount of
Peltier heat evolved per unit time in the contact ”a”.
We underline that Qa could be calculated by another
way accounting the Thomson term in Eq.(4).
Indeed,

over the contact length. In fact, Peltier eﬀect is equiva-
lent of Thomson eﬀect established at the contact.

For ∆α > 0 and current direction shown in Fig.(1) the
contact ”a” is heated while the contact ”b” is cooled.
Thus, the contacts are at diﬀerent temperatures and

, coincides with equation for conventional thermoelectro-
motive force under zero current conditions [1]. Note, εT
is an universal value since for arbitrary cooling condi-
tions it depends on the contact temperatures only. It’s
worth noting that there exists the correlation between
thermoelectromotive force, Peltier and Thomson heats.
Indeed, the total power evolved in the circuit, U I , is the
sum of Joule heat RI 2 and the thermal eﬀects related
power εT I. Then, the product εT I is exactly the sum

According to Eq.(6), for arbitrary circuit under the same
contacts temperatures( Ta, Tb and T0) the zero current
measurements of thermoelectromotive force allow to ﬁnd
the total amount of both the Peltier and Thomson heats
at I

= 0.

We recall that the sample contacts are always extra
heated(cooled) because of Peltier eﬀect. The diﬀerence of
contact temperatures ∆T is linear on current, thus, there
exists the thermal correction to ohmic resistance ∆R =
εT /I = U/I
R. For simplicity, we further assume that
the conductivity, σ ,thermopower, α , and the thermal
conductivity, κ , are all temperature independent.
In
that case, the thermopower is given εT = ∆α∆T .

Using Eqs.(4,5) one could easily ﬁnd out voltage swing
U and, thus, thermal correction ∆R for arbitrary cir-
cuit. Note, the real cooling conditions strongly inﬂuence
∆R. We now precise the cooling conditions of the circuit
shown in Fig.(1). Let us consider the adiabatic condi-
tions when the sample is thermally isolated with respect
to environment. As an example, the sample could be
placed into the vacuum chamber(see Fig.1) surrounded
by thermal reservoir kept at T0. Then, we further neglect
the heat transfer within the leads. Actually, that means
the sample is self-isolated. We emphasize that under the
above conditions the sample is not heated. Really, un-
T0 , hence,
der zero on current approximation Ta, Tb
the amount Peltier heat evolved at the ﬁrst contact ”a”
is equal to one absorbed at the second contact ”b”. At
both contacts the energy ﬂux qS is continuous, thus

According to Eq.(5,9) ∆R depends on reservoir temper-
ature, geometry and heat conductivity of sample. We
underline that the thermal correction is always positive,
since the total amount of Peltier heat QP = ∆RI 2 > 0.
Let us estimate the magnitude of the thermal correc-
tion to resistivity ∆R, when both the conductor and leads
are metals. At room temperature the electron heat con-
ductivity and thermopower of electron gas are: κ = LσT ,

rection is small compared with ohmic resistance because
of degeneracy of the electron gas. Note for semimetals(
bismuth, Ef

be greater. In contrast to metal, the thermal correction
should be ξ−2 times higher for non-degenerated semicon-
ductor since in that case ∆α

Here, r = 3/2 is the parameter related to phonon scatter-
ing mechanism. Let us consider non-degenerated n-InSb

tion band and shallow donor impurity level ∆Ed

Accordingly, ∆α = 11 k

In reality, the cooling conditions could be diﬀerent
from ones assumed. We now consider more realistic case
when the local cooling of the sample is important. For ex-
ample, the sample chamber should contain the gas. One
could take into account the cooling eﬀects using Eq.(4)
with the linear term,

change. Finally, under zero on current approximation

where η = x/l2 is the dimensionless coordinate. Accord-

the dimensionless parameter λ =

heat ﬂuxes. When λ << 1 the local cooling could be
neglected, hence, T (η) is linear(Fig.(2)). Then, in the
opposite case λ >> 1 of intensive cooling T (η) depen-
dence is sharp near the contacts.

The above result allow us to calculate the thermal
correction to sample resistance. Using Eqs.(5,7,10)
and omitting the cumbersome algebraic calculations one
could calculate the thermal correction to resistance as

λ = 14. Thus, the thermal correction to resistivity is ap-
proximately 14 times less compared to one in absence of
convection.

We emphasize that both dc and ac ohmic measure-
ments leads to thermal correction. However, at high fre-
quency ∆R diminishes due to thermal inertial eﬀects.
In fact, Eq.(9) are valid below some critical frequency
fcr = χ/d2, where χ is the temperature diﬀusive coeﬃ-
cient of the sample. For example, At T=293K for metal
conductor χ = κ/C
102cm2/s, where C is the caloriﬁc
capacity of the electron gas. Then for typical metal con-
√S = 1mm, one obtain the critical frequency
ductor d
as fcr = 104Hz. We suggest that the spectral depen-
dence of thermal correction could be used to estimate
the magnitude of the thermal correction.

In conclusion, the ohmic measurements of a conduc-
tor resistance contain the thermal correction caused by
Peltier eﬀect. The thermal correction always exists, while
its magnitude depends on actual cooling conditions of
the circuit. Above some critical frequency dependent on
thermal inertial eﬀects the thermal correction disappears.

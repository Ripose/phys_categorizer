Abstract

It is conventionally believed that solutions of so called “free” Maxwell equa-
tions for ̺ = 0 (density of charge) describe the free electromagnetic ﬁeld in
empty space (if one considers the free ﬁeld as a ﬁeld, whose ﬂux lines neither
begin nor end in a charge). We consider three types of regions: (i) “isolated
charge-free” region (where all electric ﬁelds, generated by charges outside
that particular region, are zero), for example, inside a hollow conductor of
any shape or in a free-charge Universe; (ii) “non-isolated charge-free” re-
gion (where all electric ﬁelds, generated by charges outside that particular
region, are not zero) and (iii) “charge-neutral” region (where point charges
exist but their algebraic sum is zero). The paper notes that there are two
families of solutions: (1) In “isolated charge-free” regions electric free ﬁeld
does not exist in the context of Maxwell’s equations, but there may exist a
time-independent background magnetic ﬁeld. (2) In both “charge-neutral”
and “non-isolated charge-free” regions where the homogeneous condition
̺ = 0 also holds, Maxwell’s equation for electric ﬁeld have non-zero solu-
tion, as in the conventional view, but this solution is not free ﬁeld. We
mention some implications related to free-electromagnetic ﬁelds and the
simplest charge-neutral universe.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is well-known that the set of four Maxwell’s equations (ME) [1,2] describes diﬀerent

phenomena according to particular initial and boundary conditions (BC). The authors

of this note have independently found that the set of solutions of ME may be larger

than conventionally believed [3-5]. As part of the process to establish BC for our generic

problem, we explore here the meaning of the solutions of ME in regions of space with null

charge density (̺ = 0).

Conventionally, ̺ = 0 represents “empty space” (see, e.g., Purcell [1], page 331).

Under this condition, both Eqs. (3) and (4) (see below) describe solenoidal ﬁelds, which

imply that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds (E and H) in that region of space are transverse

to the instantaneous [6] direction of propagation. Moreover, since there are no charges in

such region, the electromagnetic wave corresponds to a free ﬁeld, whose ﬂux lines neither

begin nor end in a charge.

We want to argue here that such long-standing interpretation is not completely con-

sistent with the physics behind ME. The remainder of this note is organized as follows:

in Section II we critically revisit the conventional interpretation to ﬁnd that ̺ = 0 leads

to two families of solutions. Section III explores some implications of our ﬁndings and

Section IV closes the paper.

Charge conservation is assured by the standard continuity condition:

We consider three types of regions: (i) “isolated charge-free” region (where all electric

ﬁelds, generated by charges outside that particular region, are zero), for example, inside a

hollow conductor of any shape or in a free-charge Universe; (ii) “non-isolated charge-free”

region (where all electric ﬁelds, generated by charges outside that particular region, are

not zero) and (iii) “charge-neutral” region (where point charges exist but their algebraic
sum is zero). Usually, one set2 ̺ = 0 in (1) and (3) at the whole space (or in “isolated
charge-free” region, see (i)) and obtains free equations for free ﬁeld. We argue here that

this operation does not lead to free-ﬁeld solution of ME. For our argument, it is important

to recall a process of obtaining Eqs. (1) and (3).

We know that Gauss’ law claims [1]: The ﬂux of the electric ﬁeld E through any closed

surface, that is, the integral

E · da over the surface, equals 4π times the total charge

enclosed by the surface:

H

1Recently it was shown [4] that one has to use total time-derivatives in (1)-(5) but one can do
not attach importance to this here. Recall that E = D and H = B in vacuum in CGS units.

We call this statement a law because it is equivalent to Coulomb’s law and it could serve

equally well as the basic law of electrostatic interactions, after charge and ﬁeld have been

deﬁned. Gauss’ and Coulomb’s laws are not two independent physical laws, but the same

law expressed in diﬀerent ways. Looking back over a proof of Eq.(6) in any textbook, we

can see that it hinged on the inverse-square nature of the interaction. Thus this theorem

(law) is applicable solely to inverse-square ﬁeld in physics. We stress several aspects:

a) Coulomb’s law is deﬁned in terms of the individual qi, so that the expression for

charge Q (Eq.(6)) in terms of charge density ̺ is only strictly valid as a limit when a very

large number of charges is present. (Before we are criticized, we hasten to add that, of

course, ̺ may be treated as δ-function).

b) Gauss’ law only applies to inverse-square ﬁelds, but they do not need to be isotropic.

Hence, it contains Coulomb’s law, but it is somewhat more general ([1]. p.24).

c) The right-hand-sides of Eq.(6) may be zero in two diﬀerent ways: (*) Charge-free

condition, Q = 0 when qi = 0, all “i”. (**) Charge-neutral condition, Q = 0 when

qi 6= 0, all “i” independently.

Evidently, there is no reason to expect that E on the lhs of Gauss’ law (6) should be

the same for cases (*) and (**) above. Indeed, for an isolated charge-free region the only

solution is

which simply means that a non-existing charge cannot produce an electric ﬁeld. Note

that previous assertion is qualitatively diﬀerent to saying that there exist an electric ﬁeld

in the region that becomes zero when Q = 0.

Let us remember now the Ostrogradsky-Gauss’ theorem. If this theorem holds for any

vector ﬁeld, it certainly holds for E:

E · da =

∇ · E dυ.

Both Eq.(6) and Eq.(8) hold for any volume we care to choose - of any shape, size, or

location. Comparing them, we see that this can only be true if at every point,

∇ · E = 4π̺.

(9)

But we always must take into account that (because of origin of (6)!) if ̺ is zero in the

isolated charge-free region, ∇ · E must be zero because of E is zero in the same isolated

charge-free region.

Now we can recall the origin of Eq.(3). Really, Maxwell found his famous paradox

(because of equation of continuity (5)):

∇ · jtot = ∇ · jcond + ∇ · jdisp = 0,

General solution of this equation is

Maxwell (and others, following him) set the terms

and as a results obtains Eq.(3). But after (attention!) obtaining Eq.(3) Maxwell at al

In empty space, the terms with ̺ and jcond = ̺V are zero, and Maxwell’s equations

set following:

become

But if we set ̺ = 0 at whole space we must consider now (see point (c) above) the

charge-free condition when qi = 0 for all i. In other words, we obtain isolated charge-

free region. And as a result we must obtain for this region

∇ · E = 0

∇ · H = 0

because E has to be zero in every point of this region3. Of course, in the non-isolated

charge-free region and in the charge-neutral region Eqs. (17)-(20) keep their form but in

this case we also cannot obtain an electric free ﬁeld, whose ﬂux lines neither begin nor

end in a charge (recall the origin of Eq.(9)!).

We turn now to some implications of our interpretation.

III. IMPLICATIONS OF OUR INTERPRETATION

A. Isolated charge-free region

Consider an isolated region R0 where no charges are present, i.e. Q = 0, ̺ = 0

everywhere. Eq. (7) applies, so that E = 0 everywhere in the whole space spanning R0.

Assuming that Maxwell’s equations are valid in R0 it follows that magnetic ﬁeld H may

still exist, because Maxwell’s Eq. (2) is completely independent of ̺. Indeed, in addition

to the trivial solution H = 0, many other solutions of ∇·H = 0 are possible. For instance,

H = Hxi + Hyj + Hzk with Hx = Fx(ct; y, z), Hy = Fy(ct; x, z), Hz = Fz(ct; x, y).

3the sense of (?) in Eq.(23) we explain in Subsection A of Section III

6

In a charge-free region Faraday’s equation (4) reduces to ∂H

∂t = 0, hence H is time-
independent. Our generic solution thus becomes Bx = F (y, z), By = F (x, z) and Bz =

F (x, y), where we have noted that in isotropic region there is no reason for the functional

dependence to be diﬀerent along arbitrary orientations.

Finally, Amp`ere’s law (3) leads (see Eq.(15)) to

∇ × H =

jmag

4π
c

(25)

where jmag may be some magnetic displacement current density. Eq. (25) does not impose

further constraints onto H, but rather deﬁnes the magnetic current jmag.

It may be

immediately veriﬁed that the continuity condition ∇ · jmag = 0 is fulﬁlled by all jmag

deﬁned by Eq. (25). As an explicit example, let Bx = F (y, z) = sin[k(y + z)], et cyclicum.

Then, jx = (ck/4π){cos[k(x + y) − cos[k(x + z)]} et cyclicum, where k is in inverse length

units.

Summarizing, in a charge-free region described by ME no electric ﬁeld is internally

generated, but there may exist a time-independent magnetic background.

B. Non-isolated charge-free region

Consider now a region R0 where no charges are present, Q = 0, surrounded by a

universe U where charges do exist. From the superposition principle, total electric ﬁeld

in the region is E(R) = E(R0) + E(U) = E(U), where E(R0) denotes the ﬁeld internally

generated, and E(U) represents the ﬁeld externally produced; from Eq. (7), E(R0) = 0.

Likewise, for the total magnetic ﬁeld in the region, H(R) = H(R0) + H(U), where H(R0)

is time-independent (see the discussion in previous Subsection A).

It is thus clear that the electric ﬁeld E(R) existing inside a charge-free region is not

a free ﬁeld; rather, it is generated by charges outside the region. Of course, there is no

contradiction with Gauss’ law (6) which refers to E(U) entering and leaving the charge-free

region.

C. The simplest charge-neutral universe

Consider a universe containing two equal charges of opposite sign. We can easily

obtain from ME with ̺ = 0 diﬀerent solutions {E(U), H(U)}, depending upon the initial

7

velocities and separation of the charges.

Consider now a phenomenon that was unknown to Maxwell: charge annihilation.

What happens to the electric ﬁeld E(U) if the charges meet to annihilate and form two

photons? The obvious answer is nothing, the electromagnetic ﬁeld {E(U), H(U)} contin-

ues its existence associated to the photons. None the less, there is a diﬃculty because we
are now in situation of Q = 04.

So, in a universe populated by two photons there are several fundamental questions to

answer. Firstly, do ME apply to them? Let us assume a positive answer. Then, secondly,

are we in a charge-free or in a charge-neutral situation? Each possibility has diﬀerent

implications for the inner structure of photons. If photons do not contain charge at all,

we are in a charge-free situation where the electric ﬁeld has disappeared: E(photons) = 0

(recall Eq.

(7)). Hence, all information about the photons must be contained in the

time-dependent magnetic ﬁeld H(U). However, as discussed in Subsection A above, in a

charge-free region H(R0) is time-independent, which means that the ﬁeld H(U) is frozen

in time at the moment of annihilation.

Alternatively, if we are in a charge-neutral situation, then the electromagnetic ﬁeld

{E(U), H(U)} may continue to exist associated now to the two photons. But then, it

means that inside each charge-neutral photon there must exist at least a hidden dipole!

This interpretation nicely blends with the current view from ﬁeld theory that attaches

electric dipole ﬁelds to photons.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

In this paper we argued that a rigorous application of Gauss’ law to the solution of

Maxwell’s equations leads to the identiﬁcation of two families of solutions: charge-free

and charge-neutral. This immediately implies that electric free ﬁeld does not exist in the

context of Maxwell’s equations.

In an isolated charge-free vacuum, electric ﬁeld does not exist, but there may exist

a time-independent background magnetic ﬁeld. A consideration of the simplest charge-

4see point (c) in Section II

8

neutral universe leads to some interesting conjectures regarding the inner structure of

photons.

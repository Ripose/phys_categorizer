We derive the essential space-time spectrum of the Maxwell equations in linear isotropic inhomo-
geneous media together with the corresponding essential modes. These modes represent the collapse
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld into a single point in space at a single angular frequency. The location
and frequency of the essential mode are random variables obeying the Born statistical postulate.

Wavefunction collapse is one of the phenomenological
postulates of the orthodox quantum theory. However,
this concept is so foreign to the wave behavior in general,
that many ﬁnd it impossible to accept. The recent years
have seen an increase in the number of publications de-
voted to the foundations of quantum physics. The more
constructive of the new interpretations suggest that the
collapse is just an awkward theoretical construct, claim-
ing that there is no such thing in reality.

We mention two such theories that seem to have passed
the test of time and are often regarded as candidates for a
new, less orthodox, model (see [1] for an overview). One,
called the decoherence theory, operates almost entirely
within the standard postulates of quantum mechanics, in-
cluding the statistical interpretation of the wavefunction.
The decoherence theory argues that the most important
wave feature of the quantum behavior is the interference
and as such it can only be observed with coherent wave-
functions. Therefore, the apparent breakdown of wave
behavior in the process of measurement and, more gener-
ally, in macroscopic objects, is nothing else but the major
loss of coherence induced by the environment. The loss
of coherence, however, is never perfect, so that some in-
terference is always present, even at a macroscopic level.
Isolated microscopic objects would then never experience
collapse at all. On the other hand, may be there is no
such thing as a truly isolated microscopic object.

Another theory, known as the dynamical reduction
model, suggests that the basic wave equation of quan-
tum mechanics – the Schr¨odinger equation – should be
modiﬁed, so that it would admit collapsing solutions.
The proposed modiﬁcations include a nonlinear and/or
a stochastic term, since it is believed that a unitary lin-
ear wave evolution can never exhibit a random collapsing
behavior. The dynamical reduction program neither pro-
vides nor aims at a perfectly collapsing wavefunction, and
imposes the quantum statistics a priori. Hence, both the
decoherence theory and the dynamical reduction model
introduce something that “looks and smells like a col-
lapse” [2], but in our view is not the real thing.

We believe that the true problem with accepting the

orthodox point of view is largely due to the absence of ad-
equate mathematics that would describe collapse of the
wave behavior at least in some particular setting. We
shall not go into the details of the two interpretations
mentioned above, which question the very existence of
the collapse. Instead, we shall provide an example of a
perfect collapse of wave motion, which has nothing to do
with coherence or nonlinearity. Namely, we shall show
that the linear Maxwell’s equations admit generalized
collapsing solutions, that are not only random, but also
satisfy the Born statistical postulate in a certain sense.
A few words have to be said about the mathematical
techniques employed here. We follow up on the discovery
of the essential spectrum in the volume integral formu-
lation of the electromagnetic scattering problem [3] de-
rived using the symbol theory of Mikhlin and Pr¨ossdorf
[4]. Our preliminary qualitative analysis indicated that
the “essential resonance”, which happens if the essential
spectrum gets close to zero, must be related to the so-
called plasmon, where the electromagnetic ﬁeld is coupled
to the plasma wave and is highly localized at a plasma-
dielectric interface [5]. This prompted further investiga-
tion and recently we were able to prove that the mode
corresponding to the point of essential spectrum, called
singular mode, is a very special function, indeed [6]. We
have used the Weyl deﬁnition of spectrum [7] showing
that the singular mode is a distribution, which is best
described as the square root of the Dirac delta function.
Such functions obey the Colombeau algebra [8] and, de-
spite their unique properties, are not in wide use today.
Here we apply the Weyl deﬁnition of spectrum to the
diﬀerential Maxwell’s equation and show that the elec-
tromagnetic essential spectrum is not a unique feature of
the volume integral formulation only. In fact, the spatial
singular modes, derived for the integral operator in [6],
will appear in the diﬀerential case as well. To arrive at
a physically interpretable picture we do not consider the
spatial and temporal spectra separately, but immediately
derive the essential space-time spectrum of the Maxwell’s
operator. Based on the unique structure of the essential
modes, their natural randomness, and Born-type statis-

If the Weyl sequence that satisﬁes these equations for

sequence does converge to a function from the Hilbert
space, then this function is an eigenfunction, and λ is an
eigenvalue of M.

This is why we refer to singular modes as the square root
of the delta function. Further we note that the vector-
xc) multi-
valued Ψ has the form of a position vector (x
plied by a scalar, and its Fourier transform has the form
of an angular vector k multiplied by a scalar [6]. This
means that the action of a curl operator on Ψ gives zero
for any value of parameters α and xc, which is the main
reason why singular modes are possible with the ﬁrst-
order Maxwell’s equation, but not with the second-order
wave equations in homogeneous media, where the spatial
operator is the Laplacian.

Here we intend to take into account the temporal es-

Obviously, the Weyl deﬁnition of spectrum allows
working with a very broad class of functions, and it may
seem that the modes of essential spectrum do not have
any mathematical and as a result any physical meaning.
Indeed, we show in [6], that the singular modes do not
(strongly) converge to any function of the Hilbert space.

On the other hand, the square of these functions gener-
ates the generalized Dirac’s delta function, which in its
turn acquires some meaning only upon integration. All
this amounts to saying that the essential modes may al-
low for some physical interpretation only if we square and
integrate them.

The physical quantity obtained by squaring and inte-
grating the electromagnetic ﬁeld over space and time has
the dimensions of action [J s], the electric-ﬁeld part of

Here we have used the power (Plancherel) theorem of
Fourier analysis, the fact that E(x, t) is a real function
of time, and the causality-driven assumption that the
real part of ˆε(x, ω) is an even function of ω, while the
imaginary part is odd. Of course, Se is a slightly artiﬁ-
cial quantity. It only serves to illustrate our point and
techniques.

It is clear that the same numerical value of action may
correspond to diﬀerent states of the electric ﬁeld. For
example, ﬁeld ˆE(x, ω) may be a “proper” solution of the
Maxwell equations. Alternatively, it can be an essen-
tial mode, which satisﬁes Maxwell’s equation only in the
Weyl sense, but produces a perfectly well-deﬁned action.
Consider a hypothetical transition between such states.
1 in the ﬁrst state be represented by an
integral over the electric ﬁeld ˆE1 satisfying the Maxwell
equation in the usual sense, i.e. Se
1 is given by (17) with
ˆE1 instead of ˆE. In the second state the action is repre-
sented by a single essential mode

Although, we can always make Se
2 by picking a
suitable value for the dimensional coeﬃcient C0, there
is an important diﬀerence between the “proper” ﬁeld ˆE1
and the essential modes. When we say that ˆE1 satisﬁes
Maxwell’s equations we mean that it is a solution of a
boundary value problem, which exists and is unique in
most circumstances. The essential modes, however, are
not unique. For example, for a ﬁxed C0 the conservation
of action holds with any xc and ωc at the equipotential
hypersurface (hypervolume) of Re [ˆε(xc, ωc)].

Hence, the action-preserving transformation between
the usual solutions of the Maxwell equations and the es-
sential modes is nonunique in two respects. First, with a
ﬁxed value of action there are no means to decide whether

3

this transformation takes place at all. Second, if such
transformation has happened, then the parameters of the
location of the spatial singular mode xc and the angular
frequency ωc of the temporal essential mode are com-
pletely arbitrary.

Let us see, if the physical interpretation of the essential
modes can be extended any further than the squared and
integrated action-like expressions. The previous consid-
eration suggests that in the transition between the states
both xc and ωc should be treated as random variables.
Suppose that the transition is such that each essential
mode can carry only a ﬁnite portion of action, say a, and,
therefore, the second state corresponding to some suﬃ-
ciently large numerical value of action Se
a consists
2
of a large number of essential modes rather than a single
mode. One possibility is to assign C0 = h/ε0 in (18),
describing the single-mode mode transformation, where
h is the Plank constant. Then, the amount of action dSe

where f (xc)dxc and g(ωc)dωc are the relative numbers of

probability densities. The complete action in the second

In other words, the probability density function of the
random variables xc and ωc is equal to the normalized
squared amplitude of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. This,
obviously, resembles another postulate of the quantum
theory, known as the Born rule. Although, we have to
point out that equation (21) may hold for other densities
as well, and more information is required to make (22)
the unique choice.

Thus, Maxwell’s equations admit generalized Weyl’s
solutions which exhibit many of the features of the
enigmatic wavefunction collapse. Furthermore, the ex-
istence of essential modes suggests the following hier-
archy of equations in the electromagnetic ﬁeld theory.
There are global equations on the level of the electro-
magnetic action allowing the hypothetical transitions
between “proper” and “essential” states. These equa-
tions can be satisﬁed both by the usual solutions of the
Maxwell equations and by the essential modes. Mathe-
matically, such equations are simply equalities between
quadratic functionals deﬁned on functional spaces far
broader than the common and rather restrictive complete
Hilbert space. The more informative local (pointwise)
equations involving intensities (squared amplitudes) of
the ﬁeld are satisﬁed by the “proper” solutions in the
usual sense, and only statistically by the essential modes.
The random parameters are the locations of the spatial
singular modes and the angular frequency of the tempo-
ral modes. The natural emergence of the Born statistical
rule here is truly remarkable, although, more work is re-
quired to justify it. Finally, we have the electromagnetic
ﬁeld, which satisﬁes the Maxwell equations in the usual
sense. Essential modes do not have any mathematical
and, hence, physical meaning on that level.

Instead of the electric ﬁeld action (17) we could use
a sum of several action-like or other terms quadratic in
ﬁelds, requiring the concervation of the total expression
under the transformation of modes. Although the exact
physical interpretation of the transformation may change
in that case, the methods developed here should remain
valid. Hence, we do not know yet how to induce or control
the electromagnetic collapse in practice, and if this can
be done at all. We do know the condition for the essential
resonance, i.e., λe =
iωcε(xc, ωc) = 0. With “proper”
eigenmodes the presence of a zero eigenvalue means that
all energy is stored in the corresponding mode, which is
a realizable spatial distribution of the ﬁeld. The essential

−

4

resonance, however, is not so easy to interpret. We can
only discuss the relevant physical conditions, keeping in
mind that xc and ωc are random. One straightforward
case is ωc = 0, while ε(xc, ωc)
= 0, corresponding to the
static breakdown of wave motion. Another possibility is
ε(xc, ωc) = 0, while ωc
= 0. This does not happen in
causal media. On the other hand, with strong anoma-
lous dispersion the real part of ε may be zero and even
negative. However, this is always accompanied by the in-
crease in the imaginary part of ε. Which rises a question:
should not we see the absorption of the electromagnetic
radiation, empirically described by the imaginary part
of ε, as resulting from the excitation of essential modes?
The concervation of energy (Poynting theorem) may help
to derive the corresponding relation.

Hence, collapse of the wave behavior is not such a
crazy thing after all. Mathematically it can be viewed as
the action-preserving transition between the states cor-
responding to discrete and essential spectra of operators,
which does not depend on the loss of coherence due to en-
vironment or on the presense of nonlinearity. Certainly, it
is not clear yet how to extend these ideas on the quantum
wave motion. In any case, our experience with electro-
magnetics shows that the critical analysis of the mathe-
matical conditions on the existence of the solution with
the subsequent explicit derivation of the essential modes
as the Weyl solutions of the ﬁrst-order Dirac’s equation
may be a good starting point.

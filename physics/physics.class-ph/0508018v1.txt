NUMERICAL MODELING OF ELASTIC WAVES
ACROSS IMPERFECT CONTACTS.

BRUNO LOMBARD∗ AND JO¨EL PIRAUX†

Abstract. A numerical method is described for studying how elastic waves interact with im-
perfect contacts such as fractures or glue layers existing between elastic solids. These contacts have
been classicaly modeled by interfaces, using a simple rheological model consisting of a combination
of normal and tangential linear springs and masses. The jump conditions satisﬁed by the elastic
ﬁelds along the interfaces are called the ”spring-mass conditions”. By tuning the stiﬀness and mass
values, it is possible to model various degrees of contact, from perfect bonding to stress-free surfaces.
The conservation laws satisﬁed outside the interfaces are integrated using classical ﬁnite-diﬀerence
schemes. The key problem arising here is how to discretize the spring-mass conditions, and how to
insert them into a ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme: this was the aim of the present paper. For this purpose,
we adapted an interface method previously developed for use with perfect contacts [J. Comput. Phys.
195 (2004) 90-116]. This numerical method also describes closely the geometry of arbitrarily-shaped
interfaces on a uniform Cartesian grid, at negligible extra computational cost. Comparisons with
original analytical solutions show the eﬃciency of this approach.

Key words. elastic waves, interface methods, spring-mass jump conditions, discontinuous co-

eﬃcients, imperfect contact, hyperbolic conservation laws.

1. Introduction. Here it is proposed to study the propagation of mechanical
waves in an elastic medium divided into several subdomains. The wavelengths are
assumed to be much larger than the thickness of the contact zones between subdo-
mains, or interphases [17]. Each interphase is replaced by a zero-thickness interface,
where elastic ﬁelds satisfy jump conditions. In elastodynamics, the contacts between
elastic media are usually assumed to be perfect [1]. They can therefore be modeled
by perfect jump conditions, such as perfectly bonded, perfectly lubricated, or stress-
free conditions. For example, perfectly bonded conditions will mean that both elastic
displacements and normal elastic stresses are continuous across the interface at each
time step.

In practice, contacts are often imperfect because of the presence of microcracks
or interstitial media in the interphase. Take, for example, fractures in the earth,
which are ﬁlled with air or liquid, and where jumps occur in the elastic displacements
and elastic stresses. The simplest imperfect conditions are the spring-mass condi-
tions (which are sometimes called ”linear slip displacements”): these conditions are
realistic in the case of incident waves with very small amplitudes [16]. The spring-
mass conditions have been extensively studied, both theoretically and experimentally
[17, 19, 20]. This approach has been applied in various disciplines, such as nonde-
structive evaluation of materials [2, 21] and geophysics [16].

However, very few studies have dealt so far with the numerical simulation of wave
propagation across imperfect contacts described by spring-mass conditions. To our
knowledge, only three approaches have been proposed for this purpose. First, Gu
et al. developed a boundary integral method which can be applied to arbitrarily-
shaped interfaces [7]; but this method requires knowing the Green’s functions on

both sides of the interface, which complicates the study of realistic heterogeneous
media. Secondly, a ﬁnite-element method has been proposed by Haney and Sneider [8].
The jump conditions are incorporated automatically here into the numerical scheme,
via the variational formulation, and attempts have been made to perform numerical
analysis. The main drawback of this approach is that it requires adapting the mesh to
the interface, which increases the computational eﬀort. Thirdly, other authors have
approached this problem by implicitly accounting for the boundary conditions by using
an equivalent medium, and then deriving new ﬁnite-diﬀerence formulas [3, 4]. This
approach can be applied to arbitrarily-shaped interfaces on a uniform Cartesian grid,
but the accuracy is low, and this method involves explicitly changing the numerical
scheme near the interface. Note that the inertial eﬀects were not investigated in any
of these three cases, although they may be important factors[17].

The aim of this paper is to describe a procedure for incorporating the spring-
mass conditions into existing ﬁnite-diﬀerence schemes, on a regular Cartesian grid.
The geometry of arbitrarily-shaped interfaces is properly taken into account, reduc-
ing the unwanted diﬀraction classically induced by the Cartesian grid. Lastly, the
extra computational cost is low. For this purpose, we adapted the explicit simpliﬁed
interface method (ESIM) previously developed for dealing with perfect contacts in
1D [14] and 2D [12]. A study has also dealt with imperfect contacts in 1D [11]. In
the present study, this approach is extended to 2-D conﬁgurations. The focus here is
on the description of imperfect contacts; to avoid additional complications, we take
media with simple constitutive laws (elastic and isotropic media), but the procedure
should be suitable for dealing with more realistic media. The inertial eﬀects are taken
into account.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the problem is stated in terms of
the conﬁguration, the conservation laws and the spring-mass conditions. In section 3,
a numerical strategy is described for integrating the conservation laws on the whole
computational domain: the same scheme is used throughout the domain, but near
an interface, modiﬁed values of the solution are used, which implicitly account for
the spring-mass conditions. Section 4 is the core part of this paper: it describes in
detail how to compute the modiﬁed values. Numerical experiments are described in
section 5, and comparisons with original analytical solutions show the eﬃciency of
the method. Note that although no rigorous mathematical proof of the validity of
the algorithms was obtained, the results of the numerical experiments performed were
extremely satisfactory.

2.1. Conﬁguration. Let us consider two isotropic elastic media Ω0 and Ω1 sep-
arated by a stationary interface Γ (ﬁgure 2.1). We study a two-dimensional conﬁgura-
tion with plane strains, and adopt Cartesian coordinates x and y pointing rightward
and upward, respectively. The interface is described by a parametric description
(x(τ ), y(τ )). The tangential vector t and the normal vector n are

The physical parameters are the density ρ, the elastic speed of the compressional
P-waves cp, and the elastic speed of the shear SV-waves cs. For the sake of simpli-
ﬁcation, these parameters are taken to be piecewise constant; however, they may be
discontinuous across Γ

Let P be a point on Γ (ﬁgure 2.1), and t be the time. Given a function f (x, y, t), the
limit values of f at P on both sides of Γ are written

where l = 0, 1. The jump of f across Γ, from Ω0 to Ω1, is denoted by

2.3. Spring-mass conditions. An incident wave at the interface generates four
other waves: a reﬂected P-wave, a reﬂected SV-wave, a transmitted P-wave, and a
transmitted SV-wave. To pose the problem suitably, it is necessary to deﬁne four
independent jump conditions satisﬁed by the ﬁelds along Γ (ﬁgure 2.1). Perfectly
bonded conditions are generally used for this purpose, namely

[uN (P, t)] = 0,

[σN (P, t)] = 0,

[uT (P, t)] = 0,

[σT (P, t)] = 0,

corresponding to a perfectly bonded contact between the two solids in question.

To describe an imperfect contact, one can generalize (2.9) into spring-mass con-

ditions. With the notations deﬁned in (2.4), the spring-mass conditions are

[uN (P, t)] =

σN 0(P, t),

[σN (P, t)] = MN

[uT (P, t)] =

[σT (P, t)] = MT

where KN > 0, KT > 0, MN ≥ 0, MT ≥ 0, are called the normal stiﬀness, the tangen-
tial stiﬀness, the normal mass, and the tangential mass of the interface, respectively.
The conditions (2.10) are called ”spring-mass conditions” because of analogies with

the equations governing the dynamics of a spring-mass system (ﬁgure 2.2). One basic
underlying assumption made here is that the elastic stresses do not aﬀect the nature
of the contact, and hence, that KN , KT , MN , and MT do not depend on t or on the
ﬁelds. They can vary with space, and hence with the parameter τ .

Spring-mass conditions provide an easy way of describing a wide range of contacts
between solids, from perfect contact to disconnected media. For KN → +∞, KT →
+∞, MN = 0, and MT = 0, we obtain the perfectly bonded conditions (2.9). For
KN → +∞, KT → 0, MN = 0, and MT = 0, we obtain σT (P, t) → 0, which amounts
to a perfect slip with no friction. Lastly, for KN → 0, KT → 0, MN = 0, and MT = 0,
we obtain σN (P, t) → 0 and σT (P, t) → 0, hence σ.n(P, t) → 0: the media Ω0 and
Ω1 tend to have stress-free boundaries, which means that no waves are transmitted
from one medium to the other.

The spring-mass conditions entail an important property: the plane waves re-
ﬂected and transmitted by a plane interface with conditions (2.10) are frequency-
dependent [20]. These waves therefore show a distorted proﬁle that is quite diﬀerent
from the proﬁle of the incident wave, even below the critical angle.
In addition,
even if the incident wave is spatially bounded in the direction of propagation, the
reﬂected and transmitted waves are not spatially bounded: a ”coda” follows each of
these waves. Phenomena of this kind, which do not occur with perfect conditions, are
observed experimentally (see e.g. [16]).

By choosing appropriate values of KN , KT , MN , and MT , it is possible to model
realistic conﬁgurations. The spring-mass conditions (2.10) can also be obtained quite
rigorously in some cases; the values of KN , KT , MN , and MT will therefore depend on
the physical and geometrical properties of the interphase. Take a plane elastic layer
sandwiched between two homogeneous isotropic half-spaces. If the thickness of the
intermediate layer is much smaller than the wavelength, the spring-mass conditions
can be deduced from an asymptotic analysis of the wave propagation behavior inside
the layer [17].

The use of spring-mass conditions has one drawback that follows from the ﬁrst
equation given by (2.10):
there is no reason why a negative jump of uN should
not occur, whith a absolute value greater than the real thickness of the interphase.
Since a penetration of both faces on the interphase is not physically realistic, the

6

B. LOMBARD AND J. PIRAUX

conditions (2.10) are valid only in the case of very small perturbations. With larger
perturbations, ﬁner modeling procedures are required, based on nonlinear contact
laws [22]. Jump conditions of this kind, which are currently under study, require
more complex numerical methods.

3. Time-marching.

3.1. Numerical scheme. To integrate the hyperbolic system (2.7), we intro-
duce a uniform lattice of grid points: (xi, yj, tn) = (i ∆ x, j ∆ y, n ∆ t), where ∆ x =
∆ y are the spatial mesh sizes, and ∆ t is the time step. The approximation U n
i,j
of U (xi, yj, tn) is computed using explicit two-step, spatially-centred ﬁnite-diﬀerence
schemes. The time-stepping of these schemes is written symbolically

U n+1

i,j = H i,j

U n

i+˜i, j+˜j , (˜i, ˜j) ∈ Σ

(cid:16)

.

(cid:17)

(3.1)

H i,j is a discrete operator, and Σ is the stencil of the scheme. The subscripts in H i,j
refer to the physical parameters at (xi, yj). See [9] for a review of the huge body of
literature on numerical methods for conservation laws.

The interface Γ is immersed in the regular meshing, so that one can distinguish
between two sets of grid points: the regular points, where the stencil of the scheme
involves a single medium, e.g. Ω0 or Ω1, and the irregular points, where the stencil of
the scheme crosses Γ. The distribution of irregular points along Γ obviously depends
on the geometry of Γ and on the stencil of the scheme. At regular points, the scheme
(3.1) is applied classically, as in homogeneous media. At irregular points, however, the
scheme (3.1) is modiﬁed to take the spring-mass conditions (2.10) into account. This
modiﬁcation is carried out using an interface method, and the main aim of the present
article is to describe this procedure, which will be presented in detail in subsequent
sections.

In the numerical experiments described in section 5, we use a second-order scheme:
the Wave Propagation Algorithm (WPALG), originally developed by LeVeque in the
Its stencil is (˜i = −2 ...2, ˜j = −2 ...2)
ﬁeld of computational ﬂuid dynamics [10].
and (˜i, ˜j) 6= (±2, ±2). WPALG is a useful tool for dealing with linear elastic wave
propagation, for at least three reasons. First, il involves the use of nonlinear ﬂux lim-
iters that prevent numerical dispersion. Secondly, this scheme reduces the numerical
anisotropy introduced by the Cartesian grid. Thirdly, WPALG is stable in 2D up to
CFL=1. For the convergence measurements performed in section 5 (test 1), we also
used the standard second-order Lax-Wendroﬀ scheme.

Note that other schemes can be used: in particular, we have successfully combined
the interface method with staggered schemes, such as [18].
It should therefore be
possible to adapt most solvers for use with the interface method described in the
forthcoming discussion.

3.2. Interface method. From now on, we will focus on the time-stepping pro-
cedure near the interface. To take into account the spring-mass conditions satisﬁed
along Γ, the scheme (3.1) is also applied at irregular points, but some of the numer-
ical values used for the time-stepping procedure are changed. The use of so-called
modiﬁed values deduced from the jump conditions is the key feature of the interface
method developed in our previous studies: the ”explicit simpliﬁed interface method”
(ESIM) [11, 12, 14]. At time tn, the general method used to compute modiﬁed values
is as follows. On each side of Γ, one deﬁnes a smooth extension U ∗(x, y, tn) of the
exact solution on the other side. The extension U ∗ is built satisfying the same jump

numerical estimate of U ∗ at this point.

Let us introduce some notations. Take an irregular point M with coordinates
(xI , yJ ), belonging to Ω1 (the following discussion can easily be adapted to the case
where M (xI , yJ ) ∈ Ω0). Let P (xP , yP ) be a point on Γ near M , for example the
closest orthogonal projection of M onto Γ (ﬁgure 3.1). The vector containing the
limit values of the exact solution U (x, y, tn) and those of its spatial derivatives at P
up to the k-th order is denoted by

confusion, they are summed up in table 3.1. To obtain concise expressions for the k-th

The time-stepping procedure is completed over the whole computational domain by
applying (3.1) at the regular points. It only remains now to calculate U ∗’s, since U k

in (3.4) is unknown.

4. Calculating modiﬁed values.

4.1. Diﬀerentiation of the spring-mass conditions. In the ﬁrst step towards
calculating the modiﬁed value (3.4), we look for the jump conditions satisﬁed by U k
l
(3.2), for any k. These conditions are deduced from the spring-mass conditions (2.10)
satisﬁed by uN,T and σN,T . Before describing the procedure, let us introduce a new
notation. The vector containing the limit values of the (k + 1)-th spatial derivatives
of U (x, y, t) at P is denoted by

where l = 0 or 1, α = 0, ..., k + 1. This vector has 5(k + 2) components. Once again,
the point P considered and the instant t are omitted.

For k = 0, the two equations in (2.10) that deal with the jump in the elastic
displacement are diﬀerentiated in terms of t. The geometry of Γ and stiﬀness and
mass values do not depend on t; since v = ∂u

∂ t , we obtain

[vN (P, t)] =

4.6. Comments about the algorithm. This algorithm can easily be adapted
to existing codes without having to change the scheme. At each time step, one only
needs to compute a few ”modiﬁed values” (4.21), which do not depend on the scheme
selected.

14

B. LOMBARD AND J. PIRAUX

Since the interface is stationary and the nature of the contacts does not vary
with time, most of the algorithm can be built up during a preprocessing step, con-
sisting in determining irregular points, deriving interface conditions (4.7), solving
underdetermined systems (4.15), and computing the matrices involved in (4.21). All
these quantities are stored for future use. At each time step, we need only to carry
out one matrix-vector multiplication (4.21) at each irregular point, before running
time-stepping procedure. The matrices involved here are small: 5 × 5 nq components,
usually with nq ≈ 20. In addition, the number of irregular points is much smaller than
the number of grid points. The extra computational cost is therefore very low. The
CPU time measurements are likely to be approximately the same as those presented
in [12].

The main aim of the interface method is to incorporate the jump conditions into
ﬁnite-diﬀerence schemes. But it also gives a ﬁner resolution of the geometries than
the poor stair-step description induced by the Cartesian grid. The diﬀerentiations of
spring-mass conditions involve successive derivatives of x
(see section 4.1). In
addition, the Taylor expansions in (4.16), (4.17) and (4.21) give an information about
the position of P inside the mesh.

4.7. Open questions. Four questions relating to numerical analysis remain to
be solved. First, what are the eﬀects of the term N U
which was neglected in
(4.18) ? In 1D [11], we established that this term is of the same order as the remainder
terms. The proof in 1D was based on performing explicit calculations on MAPLE;
this approach seems diﬃcult to apply in the 2-D context, because it depends on the
geometry of Γ near P .

k+1
0

Secondly, what is the local truncation error at the irregular points obtained by
combining the interface method with the scheme ? In the 1-D context [11, 14], we
established that the following was true:
if r is the order of the scheme, the local
truncation error at irregular points is still equal to r if k ≥ r (which means k ≥ 2
in the case of second-order schemes such as WPALG), when this scheme is combined
with the interface method. Extending this result to the 2-D context would require
, and bounding the matrix M −1. In
answering the previous question about N U
practice, the convergence measurements indicate that this property is false in the 2-D
context (at least for r = 2): we need k = 3 to ensure second-order accuracy (see
section 5.2).

k+1
0

Thirdly, what happens in the extreme case of a homogeneous medium (that is,
ρ0 = ρ1, cp0 = cp1, cs0 = cs1, KN → +∞, KT → +∞, MN = 0 and MT = 0) ?
The ideal would obviously be that U ∗
i,j = U n
i,j, in order to recover the scheme in
homogeneous medium. In 1-D conﬁgurations [11], we have shown that it is the case,
given simple conditions about the set B used to estimate the modiﬁed values. In a 2-D
context, these conditions cannot be satisﬁed because estimating the modiﬁed values
requires least-squares computations. However, it would be interesting to estimate the
diﬀerence between U ∗

i,j, which might yield to an optimal choice of B.

i,j and U n

Fourthly and lastly, the stability analysis still remains to be performed. With a
nonlinear scheme (such as WPALG), this seems out of reach so far, but an analysis
could perhaps be carried out with linear schemes (such as the Lax-Wendroﬀ scheme).
In the absence of theoretical rules, we have numerically considered many geometrical
conﬁgurations, physical parameters values, stiﬀness and mass values. With a wide
range of parameters, no instabilities are usually observed up to the CFL limit, even
after very long integration times (a few thousands of time steps). However, insta-
bilities are observed in two cases. First, instabilities can increase when the physical

ELASTIC WAVES AND IMPERFECT CONTACTS

15

parameters diﬀer considerably between the two sides of an interface. This problem was
previously mentioned in [12] in connection with perfect contacts. In practice, it is not
too penalizing when dealing with realistic media: even quite large diﬀerences between
the impedance values, such as those encountered in the case of Plexiglass-aluminium
interfaces, yield stable computations. Secondly, the instabilities can increase at low
values of KN,T , when the two media tend to be disconnected. This may be due to the
small denominators in (2.10). In this case, increasing the order k provides an eﬃcient
means of improving the stability limit (see subsection 5.4).

5. Numerical experiments.

5.1. Conﬁgurations. Five numerical experiments are performed here. Except
for test 3, the physical parameters are the same on both sides of Γ: this enables us
to underscore both the eﬀects of the spring-mass conditions and the accuracy of the
interface method, since all wave reﬂections and changes observed will result from the
spring-mass conditions, described numerically by the interface method.

Three geometrical conﬁgurations are studied: a plane interface, a circular in-
terface, and a non-canonical object described by cubic splines. Analytical solutions
can be obtained for the ﬁrst two conﬁgurations when the spring-mass conditions are
constant. The analytical solution of the problem with a plane wave impinging on
a plane interface with spring-mass conditions can be quite easily calculated using
Fourier analysis; this procedure will therefore not be described here. We have not
found articles dealing with the more intricate case of a circular interface; since this
analytical solution is useful to validate the algorithm, it has been described in Ap-
pendix B. Except for the convergence measurements in Test 1, all the computations
were performed with the WPALG.

Apart from test 5, the computations are all initialized by a plane right-going

ε = 2 10−3. The numerical experiments are performed with Nx × Ny = 400 × 400 grid
points, which amounts to 56 and 28 grid points per central wavelength for P-waves and
SV-waves, respectively. We take CFL=0.9, and k = 2 for the extrapolations involved
in the interface method. To initialize the computation, one also needs to compute
reﬂected and transmitted P- and SV-waves, via discrete Fourier transforms (DFT).
To obtain the required level of accuracy, we perform the DFTs on 32768 points, with
a sampling frequency of 0.018125 Hz. At each time step, the exact solution is imposed
at the boundaries of the computational domain.

Figure 5.1 shows the solution at time steps ti = t0 + 75 i ∆ t (i = 0, 1, 2). The

slices are performed from

• i = 0: (x = 70 m, y = 26 m) to (x = 360 m, y = 26 m),
• i = 1: (x = 156 m, y = 162 m) to (x = 207 m, y = 162 m),
• i = 2: (x = 246 m, y = 198 m) to (x = 282 m, y = 198 m).

Looking from the left to the right on the ﬁrst slice (i = 0), one can successively
observe the reﬂected SV-wave, the transmitted SV-wave and the transmitted P-wave.
As mentioned in section 2.3, these waves do not have the same sinusoidal proﬁle as the
incident P-wave. A ”coda” occurs after the reﬂected and transmitted P and SV-waves:
as in [11], these ﬁelds are not spatially bounded in the direction of the propagation.
The second slice (i = 1) crosses the reﬂected SV-wave. The agreement between
exact and numerical values is good; one only observes a small amount of numerical
diﬀusion induced by WPALG. This is also so in the case of the last slice (i = 2) across
the transmitted SV-wave.

In table 5-1, we give the results of the convergence measurements obtained by
reﬁning the mesh, with the Lax-Wendroﬀ scheme and with WPALG, taking k = 3:
the orders of accuracy are the same as in homogeneous medium. Similar results can
be obtained by increasing k. However, for k = 2, the convergence orders fall below
1.4. (we recall that k = 2 suﬃcies to ensure second-order accuracy for perfect contacts
in 2-D contexts [12], and for imperfect contacts in 1-D contexts [11]).

5.3. Test 2: circular interface between identical media. As a second ex-
ample, we take the case of a Lx × Ly = 600 × 600 m2 domain and a circular interface
(radius a = 100 m, centred at x0 = 330.5 m, y0 = 300 m). The numerical experiments
are performed on Nx × Ny = 600 × 600 grid points. The physical parameters are the
same as in the previous example. The spring-mass conditions are

KN = KT = 109 kg/s2,

MN = MT = 1000 kg/m2.






Figures 5.2 and 5.3 show the solution at the initial instant t0 = 0.08 s, and at ti =
t0 + 100 i ∆ t (i = 1, ..., 5) on a restricted domain [100, 500] × [100, 500] m2 centred on
the middle of the computational domain. No special treatment is applied to simulate
the wave propagation in inﬁnite medium (such as absorbing boundary conditions or
perfectly matched layers), but the integration times are suﬃciently short to prevent
spurious waves reﬂected by the edges of the computational region from appearing in
the restricted domain (the same comment holds for the further ﬁgures). The slices
are carried out from

• i = 0: (x = 101 m, y = 301 m) to (x = 289 m, y = 301 m),
• i = 1: (x = 144 m, y = 300 m) to (x = 243 m, y = 300 m),
• i = 2: (x = 108 m, y = 433 m) to (x = 353 m, y = 433 m),

• i = 3: (x = 339 m, y = 339 m) to (x = 413 m, y = 339 m),
• i = 4: (x = 340 m, y = 300 m) to (x = 493 m, y = 300 m),
• i = 5: (x = 198 m, y = 264 m) to (x = 454 m, y = 264 m).

The analytical solutions are computed on NBessel = 90 points (see (B.16) in Appendix
B), 256 Fourier points, with 1-Hz sampling frequency.

The incident P-wave is converted into transmitted and reﬂected P- and SV-waves
(i = 1, 2). A series of refraction-conversion events is then observed (i = 3, 4, 5). The
agreement between the numerical and analytical values is excellent.

5.4. Test 3: circular interface between diﬀerent media. As a third exam-
ple, we consider the same circular interface as in the previous test, but take it to have
diﬀerent physical parameters on both each sides of Γ

(ρ, cp, cs) = 


ρ0 = 2600 kg/m3, cp0 = 6400 m/s, cs0 = 3200 m/s,

ρ1 = 1200 kg/m3, cp1 = 2800 m/s, cs1 = 1400 m/s.



These parameters are those of aluminium (inside Γ) and Plexiglass (outside Γ). Apart
from these physical parameters, the values used for the computations are the same as
in section 5.3. The initial values are the same as in ﬁgure 5.2, i = 0.

Figure 5.4 gives the results of a parametric study in terms of the normal stiﬀness
KN : perfect contact (i = 0) which amounts to KN → +∞, KN = 109 kg/s2 (i = 1),
and KN = 108 kg/s2 (i = 2). The inertial eﬀects and the tangential stiﬀness are not
taken into account here

KT → +∞,






MN = MT = 0 kg/m2.
The computations are shown in this ﬁgure after 350 time steps. The slices are per-
formed from x = 100 m to x = 500 m, at y = 300 m. Compared with the case of
perfect contact (i = 0), one can see in (i = 1, 2) that the signs of the reﬂected waves
are reversed. The waves that have entirely crossed the interface also diﬀer greatly
between the three cases. The case (i = 2) is much more diﬃcult to handle than the
cases (i = 0, 1) from the computational point of view. To obtain the good agreement
shown in ﬁgure 5.4 (i = 2), it is necessary to use k = 4 (for the numerical solution),
and 32768 Fourier points with a sampling frequency of 0.018125 Hz (for the analytical
solution).

Smaller values of KN have also been investigated (ﬁgures not shown here). Below
KN = 107 kg/s2, numerical instabilities have been observed when k = 2 (see subsec-
tion 4.7), whereas the computations remain stable when k ≥ 3. Instabilities increase
below KN = 105 kg/s2 if k = 3. Stable computations and excellent agreement with
the analytical solutions are obtained down to KN = 104 kg/s2 if k = 4.

5.5. Test 4: cubic spline between identical media. Up to now, we have
dealt only with canonical objects with constant curvature. However, the use of the
interface method is not restricted to such simple geometries. In this section, we study
a more complex conﬁguration corresponding to a cubic spline. The other parameters
are the same as in section 5.3, except t0 = 0.07 s.

Figure 5.5 shows snapshots of the solutions at times ti = t0 + 150 i ∆ t (i =
0, 1, 2). We obviously have no analytical solutions to compare with the numerical
values. However, the computations remain stable, and the wave phenomena seem to
be realistic.

5.6. Test 5: plane interface with variable jump conditions. In the last
experiment, we study the case of a plane interface with variable spring-mass condi-
tions. The interface Γ is placed horizontally at y = 130 m on a Lx × Ly = 600 × 400
m2 domain. The physical parameters have the same values as in section 5.2, and they
are identical on both sides of Γ. The variable values of normal and tangential stiﬀness
are

where g(τ ) is a cubic polynomial that ensures a C1 continuity (τ is the abscissa along

part of the interface, and almost perfectly-disconnected media on the right part of the
interface. The inertial eﬀects are not taken into account: MN = MT = 0 kg/m2.

The computations are initialized by a transient explosive P-wave centred at (xs =

300 m, ys = 200 m), with an elastic potential [13]

The velocities and stresses of the incident wave can be deduced from (5.4) thanks
to classical elastodynamics relations [1]. The numerical experiments are performed
on Nx × Ny = 600 × 400 grid points, with fc = 70 Hz, t0 = 0.03 s, tc = 0.01429 s,
CFL=0.9 and k = 3.

Figure 5.6 shows snapshots of the numerical solution at t = t0 + 150 i ∆ t. The
palettes are changed in each snapshot to maintain a constant range of colours despite
the geometrical spreading of the waves. On the left part of the second snapshot
(i = 1), the incident wave is totally transmitted; on the right part, the wave is almost
totally reﬂected. The rapid change in the stiﬀness values occuring near x = 300 m
acts as a point source for cylindrical P- and SV-waves. On the last snapshot, one
can also observe a rightward-moving surface wave, denoted by a yellow-magenta zone.
Since both sides are almost stress-free surfaces in that place, this surface wave is a
Rayleigh wave [1].

6. Conclusion. This paper deals with the numerical simulation of 2D wave
propagation in elastic solids separated by imperfect contacts. These contacts are
modeled by interfaces with linear jump conditions: the spring-mass conditions fre-
quently used in geophysics [16] and nondestructive evaluation of materials [21]. The
spring-mass conditions are incorporated into ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain schemes on

a uniform Cartesian grid, via an interface method. This is an extension of previous
studies on perfect contacts in 1-D [14] and 2-D [12] contexts, and on imperfect contacts
in 1-D context [11]. The interface method also provides a ﬁne description of the sub-
cell geometry of the interfaces, at a negligible extra computational cost. Comparisons
with original analytical solutions show the great accuracy of this approach.

Future paths of study might consist of taking into account numerically more
realistic models for imperfect contact situations. A ﬁrst improvement consists of
describing the energy dissipation, as done, for example, in linear viscous bonding
models [5]. A second improvement consists of extending the present approach for
including nonlinear contact laws, which model realistic fractures and which prevent
from interpenetration between the materials [22].

Appendix B. Exact solution for a plane wave on a circular interface

with spring-mass conditions.

This analytical solution is obtained in 6 steps:

1. Fourier-transforming the incident wave (5.1);
2. writing the elastic potentials on the basis of circular functions;

ELASTIC WAVES AND IMPERFECT CONTACTS

27

3. expressing the elastic ﬁelds in terms of their potentials;
4. computing the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients from (2.10);
5. returning to Cartesian coordinates;
6. inverting Fourier transform of the elastic ﬁelds (not described here).

Step 1. The Fourier transform F of a function s(t), and its inverse Fourier transform
F −1, are denoted by

ˆs(ω) = F (s(t)) =

s(t) e−i ω t d t,

The ﬁrst-kind Bessel functions Jn satisfy the classical property [13]

e−i r cos θ =

εn in (−1)n cos n θ Jn(r),

(B.4)

with εn = 1 if n = 0, 2 else. From (B.2), (B.3), and (B.4), we can therefore express
the harmonic potential of the incident P-wave as

ˆΦIP (x, y, ω) = A S

εn in(−1)n cos n θ Jn(kp1 r).

(B.5)

To satisfy the Sommerfeld condition, the harmonic elastic potential ˆΦRP of reﬂected
P-waves and the harmonic pseudo-potential ˆΨRS = (0, 0, ˆΨRS) of reﬂected SV-waves
are written on the basis of second-kind Hankel functions Hn. To prevent singularities
from occuring at r = 0, the harmonic potential ˆΦT P of transmitted P-waves and the

Since the values of Hankel functions can be huge (typically 1060), one must be careful
when inverting (B.16). Normalisation of Qn and the use of extended arithmetic are
required for this purpose.

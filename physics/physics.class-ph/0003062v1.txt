Limits on the Applicability of Classical Electromagnetic Fields as Inferred from the

Radiation Reaction

Kirk T. McDonald

Joseph Henry Laboratories, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544

(Jan. 29, 1998)

Can the wavelength of a classical electromagnetic ﬁeld be
arbitrarily small, or its electric ﬁeld strength be arbitrarily
large? If we require that the radiation-reaction force on a
charged particle in response to an applied ﬁeld be smaller than
the Lorentz force we ﬁnd limits on the classical electromag-
netic ﬁeld that herald the need for a better theory, i.e., one
in better accord with experiment. The classical limitations
ﬁnd ready interpretation in quantum electrodynamics. The
examples of Compton scattering and the QED critical ﬁeld
strength are discussed. It is still open to conjecture whether
the present theory of QED is valid at ﬁeld strengths beyond
the critical ﬁeld revealed by a semiclassical argument.

I. INTRODUCTION

The ultimate test of the applicability of a physical the-
ory is the accuracy with which it describes natural phe-
nomena. Yet on occasion the diﬃculty of a theory in
dealing with a “thought experiment” provides a clue as
to limitations of that theory.

It has long since been recognized that classical elec-
trodynamics has been surplanted by quantum electrody-
namics in some respects. But one doubts that quantum
electrodynamics, or even its generalization, the Standard
Model of elementary particles, is valid in all domains.
To aid in the search for new physics, it is helpful to re-
view the warning signs of the past transitions from one
theoretical description to another.

The debates as to the meaning of the classical radia-
tion reaction for pointlike particles provide examples of
such warning signs. One case is the “4/3 problem” of
electromagnetic mass, where covariance does not imply
uniqueness [1]. Such diﬃculties have often been inter-
preted as suggesting that classical electrodynamics can-
not be a complete description of matter on the scale of
the classical electron radius, r0 = e2/mc2 in Gaussian
units.

It seems less appreciated that the part of the classi-
cal radiation reaction that is independent of particle size
provides clues as to the limits of applicability of classi-
cal electromagnetic ﬁelds. For example, a recent article
[2] ends with the sentence, “Only when all distances in-
volved are in the classical domain is classical dynamics
acceptable for electrons”. While this condition is neces-
sary, it is not suﬃcient. For a classical description to be
accurate, an electron can only be subject to ﬁelds that
are not too strong. This paper seeks to illustrate what
“not too strong” means.

Considerations of strong ﬁelds have been very inﬂuen-
tial in the development of other modern theories besides
quantum electrodynamics. In classical gravity, i.e., gen-
eral relativity, the strong-ﬁeld problem is identiﬁed with
black holes. One of the best known intersections between
gravity and quantum electrodynamics is the Hawking ra-
diation of black holes.
In the case of the strong (nu-
clear) interaction, the ﬁelds associated with nuclear mat-
ter all appear to be strong, and weak ﬁelds are thought
to exist only in the high-energy limit (asymptotic free-
dom). Such considerations led to the introduction of non-
Abelian gauge theories. These constructs, when applied
to the weak interaction, led to the concept of a back-
ground (Higgs) ﬁeld that is strong in the sense of having
a large vacuum expectation value, which in turn has the
eﬀect of generating the masses of the W and Z gauge
bosons. Most recently, considerations of the strong-ﬁeld
(strong-coupling) limit of string theories have led to the
notion of “duality”, i.e., the various string theories of the
1980’s are actually diﬀerent weak-ﬁeld limits of a single
strong-ﬁeld theory. These string theories are noteworthy
for suggesting that particles are to be considered as exci-
tations of small, but extended quantum strings, thereby
avoiding the inﬁnite self energies that have appeared in
theories of point particles since J.J. Thomson introduced
the concept of electromagnetic mass in 1881 [3].

The main argument concerning classical electromag-
netic ﬁelds is given in sec. 2, and is brief. This argument
could have been given around 1900 by Lorentz [4–6] or
by Planck [7]. who made remarks of a related nature.
But the argument seems to have been ﬁrst made in 1935
by Oppenheimer [8], and more explicitly by Landau and
Lifshitz [9]. Additional historical commentary is given in
sec. 1.1. Sections 2.1-2.5 comment on various aspects of
the main argument, still from a classical perspective. A
quantum view in introduced in sec. 3, and the important
examples of Compton scattering and the QED critical
ﬁeld are discussed in secs. 3.1-2. The paper concludes in
sec. 4 with remarks on the role of strong ﬁelds on the de-
velopment of quantum electrodynamics, and presents two
examples (secs. 4.1-2) of speculative features of strong-
ﬁeld QED and one of very short distance QED (sec. 4.3).

A. Historical Introduction

The relation between Newton’s third law and electro-
magnetism has been of concern at least since the inves-
tigations of Amp`ere, who insisted that the force of one

1

current element on another be along their line of centers.
See Part IV, Chap. II, especially sec. 527, of Maxwell’s
Treatise for a review [10]. However, the presently used
diﬀerential version of the Biot-Savart law does not satisfy
Newton’s third law for pairs of current elements unless
they are parallel.

Perhaps discomfort with this fact contributed to the
delay in acceptance of the concept of isolated electrical
charges, in contrast to complete loops of current, until
the late nineteenth century.

A way out of this dilemma became possible after 1884
when Poynting [11] and Heaviside [12] argued that elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds (in suitable conﬁgurations) can be
thought of as transmitting energy. The transmission of
energy was then extended by Thomson [13], Poincar´e [14]
and Abraham [15] to include transmission (and storage)
of momentum by an electromagnetic ﬁeld.

That a moving charge interacting with thermal radia-
tion should feel a radiation pressure was anticipated by
Stewart in 1871 [16], who inferred that both the energy
and the momentum of the charge would be aﬀected.

In 1873, Maxwell discussed the pressure of light on
conducting media at rest, and on “the medium in which
waves are propagated” ( [10], secs. 792-793). In the for-
mer case, the radiation of a reﬂected wave by a (perfectly
conducting) medium in response to an incident wave re-
sults in momentum, but not energy, being transferred to
the medium. The energy for the reﬂected wave comes
from the incident wave.

The present formulation of the radiation reaction is due
to Lorentz’ investigations of the self force of an extended
electron, beginning in 1892 [4] and continuing through
1903 [5]. The example of dipole radiation of a single
charge contrasts strikingly with Maxwell’s discussion of
reaction forces during specular reﬂection. There is no net
momentum radiated by an oscillating charge with zero
average velocity, but energy is radiated. The external
force alone can not account for the energy balance. An
additional force is needed, and was identiﬁed by Lorentz
as the net electromagnetic force of one part of an ex-
tended, accelerated charge distribution on another. See
eq. (1) below.

In 1897, Planck [7,17] applied the radiation reaction
force of Lorentz to a model of charged oscillators and
noted the existence of what are sometimes called “run-
away” solutions, which he dismissed as having no physical
meaning (keine physikalishe Bedeutung).

The basic concepts of the radiation reaction were
brought essentially to their ﬁnal
form by Abraham
[18,19], who emphasized the balance of both energy and
momentum in the motion of extended electrons moving
with arbitrary velocity.

Important contributions to the subject in the early
twentieth century include those of Sommerfeld [20],
Poincar´e [21], Larmor [22], Lindemann [23], Von Laue
[24], Born [25], Schott [26–29], Page [30], Nordstr¨om [31],
Milner [32], Fermi [33], Wenzel [34], Wesel [35] and Wil-
son [36]. The main theme of these works was, however,

models of classical charges and the related topic of elec-
tromagnetic mass.

The struggle to understand the physics of atoms led to
diminished attention to classical models of charged parti-
cles in favor of quantum mechanics and quantum electro-
dynamics (QED). In 1935, there was apparent disagree-
ment between QED and reported observations at energy
scales of 10-100 MeV. Oppenheimer [8] then conjectured
whether QED might fail at high energies and, in partial
support of his view, invoked a classical argument con-
cerning diﬃculties of interpretation of the radiation re-
action at short distances. The present article illustrates
an aspect of Oppenheimer’s argument that was developed
further by Landau [9].

Another response to Oppenheimer’s conjecture was by
Dirac [37] in 1938, when he deduced a covariant expres-
sion for the radiation reaction force (previously given by
Abraham, Lorentz and von Laue in noncovariant nota-
tion) by an argument not based on a model of an ex-
tended electron. Dirac also gave considerable discus-
sion of the paradoxes of runaway solutions and pre-
acceleration. This work of Dirac, and most subsequent
work on the classical radiation reaction, emphasized the
internal consistency of classical electromagnetism as a
mathematical theory, rather than as a description of na-
ture. But, as has been remarked by Schott [26], “there is
considerable danger, in a purely mathematical investiga-
tion, of losing touch with reality”. Quantum mechanics
had triumphed.

Research articles on the classical radiation reaction are
still being produced; see, for example, Refs. [38]- [89].
Sarachik and Schappert ( [67], sec. IIID) present a brief
version of the argument given below in sec. 2.

Reviews of the subject include Refs. [90]- [124]. Most
noteworthy in relation to the present article are the re-
views by Lorentz [6], Erber [100] and Klepikov [109],
which are the only ones that indicate an awareness of
the problem of strong ﬁelds. The texts of Landau and
Lifshitz [9], Jackson [106] and Milonni [111] brieﬂy men-
tion that issue.

The radiation reaction has been a frequent topic of
articles in the American Journal of Physics, including
Refs. [2] and [113]- [129]. The article of Page and Adams
[113] is noteworthy for illustrating how the concept of
electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum restores the full validity
of Newton’s third law in an interesting example of the
interaction of a pair of moving charges.

II. A GENERAL RESULT FOR THE RADIATION

REACTION

Consider an electron of charge e and mass m mov-
ing in electric and magnetic ﬁelds E and B. The mass
m is the “eﬀective mass” in the language of Lorentz [6],
now called the “renormalized” mass, for which the di-
vergent electromagnetic self energy of a small electron is

2

cancelled in a manner beyond the scope of this article.
Then the remaining leading eﬀect of the radiation reac-
tion is the “radiation resistance” which is independent
of hypotheses as to the structure of the electron. Our
argument emphasizes the eﬀect of radiation resistance,
since any deductions about properties of electromagnetic
ﬁelds will then be as free as possible from controversy as
to the nature of matter.

The (nonrelativistic) equation of motion including ra-

diation resistance is (in Gaussian units)

where

where r0 = e2/mc2 = 2.8 × 10−13 cm is the classical
electron radius.

Equation (7) makes physical sense only when the ra-
diation reaction force is smaller than the external force.
Here we don’t explore whether the length r0 describes a
physical electron; we simply consider it to be a length
that arises from the charge and mass of an electron.
Rather, we concentrate on the implication of eq. (7) for
the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Then we infer that a classical
description becomes implausible for ﬁelds whose wave-
length is small compared to length r0, or whose strength
is large compared to e/r2
0.

A. Commentary

is the force of radiation resistance, v is the velocity of
the electron, c is the speed of light and the dot indicates
diﬀerentiation with respect to time. Equation (3) is the
form of the radiation reaction given in the original deriva-
tions of Lorentz [4] and Planck [7,17], which is suﬃcient
for the main argument of this paper. Some discussion
of the larger context of the classical radiation reaction is
given in secs. 2.1-5.

If the second time derivative of the velocity is small we

estimate it by taking the derivative of (1):

We further suppose that the velocity is small (without
loss of generality according to the principle of relativity;
see sec. 2.4 for a relativistic discussion). so it suﬃces to
approximate ˙v as eE/m in (4). Hence,

¨v ≈

e ˙E

The radiation resistance is now

The ﬁrst term in (6) contributes only for time-varying
ﬁelds, which I take to have frequency ω and reduced
˙E ∝ ωE. The second term con-
wavelength λ; hence,
tributes only when E × B 6= 0, which is most likely to be
in a wave (with E = B) if the ﬁelds are large. So, for an
electron in an external wave ﬁeld, the magnitude of the
radiation-resistance force is

The argument related to eq. (7) is that there are clas-
sical electromagnetic ﬁelds that lead to physically im-
plausible behavior when radiation-reaction eﬀects are in-
cluded. This does not necessarily imply any mathemati-
cal inconsistency in the theory. Indeed, various authors
have displayed solutions for electron motion coupled to
an oscillator of very high natural frequency [48,101].
Such solutions are well-deﬁned mathematically but ap-
pear “physically implausible”. Of course, the mathemat-
ics might be correct in predicting the physical behavior in
an unfamiliar situation. So it becomes a matter of exper-
iment to decide whether the characterization “implausi-
ble” corresponds to physical reality or not. The experi-
ments that produce the most inﬂuential results are typ-
ically those that reveal new phenomena in realms where
prevailing theories are “implausible”.

Thus far, there is no evidence for the behavior pre-
dicted by the classical equations for electrons interact-
ing with waves of frequencies greater than c/r0. Rather,
quantum mechanics is needed for a good description of
the phenomena observed in that case, Compton scatter-
ing being an early example (sec. 3.1). Laboratory stud-
ies of strong-ﬁeld electrodynamics have been undertaking
only recently (sec. 3.2), and deal primarily with eﬀects
not anticipated in a classical description.

The argument of sec. 2 can also be considered as a
model-independent version of a restriction that Lorentz
placed on his derivation of eqs. (1-3) ( [6], sec. 37,
eq. (73)). Namely, the derivation makes physical sense
only if

l
ct

≪ 1,

(8)

where l is a characteristic length of the problem, and t is
a characteristic time “during which the state of motion
is sensibly altered”.

3

Lorentz would certainly have considered the classical
electron radius, r0, as an example of a relevant character-
istic length. Hence, for an electron in an electromagnetic
wave of (reduced) wavelength λ, the characteristic time
of the resulting motion is λ/c, and Lorentz’ condition (8)
becomes

r0
λ

≪ 1,

(9)

A close variant of the above argument was also given by
Planck [7].

In case of a strong ﬁeld with a long (possibly inﬁnite)
wavelength, Lorentz’ condition (8) can be interpreted as
requiring the change in the electron’s velocity to be small
compared to the speed of light during the time it takes
light to travel one classical electron radius. That is, we
require

and hence,

∆v = a∆t =

eE
m

r0
c

≪ c,

E ≪

mc2
er0

=

e
r2

.

(10)

(11)

Thus, we arrive by another (although closely related)
path to the conclusion drawn previously from eq. (7).
Perhaps because the limiting ﬁeld strength implied by
(11) is extraordinarily large by practical standards, nei-
ther Lorentz nor Planck mentioned it explicitly.

In the ﬁrst sentence of his 1938 article, Dirac [37] stated
that “the Lorentz model of the electron...has proved very
valuable...in a certain domain of problems, in which the
electromagnetic ﬁeld does not vary too rapidly and the
accelerations of the electrons are not too great”. How-
ever, he does not elaborate on the meaning of “not too
great”.

Dirac’s derivation of the radiation-reaction 4-force was
not based on a model of an extended electron, and so
the derivation was not subject to Lorentz’ restriction (8).
But as a co-inventor of quantum mechanics, Dirac cannot
have expected his classical results to have unrestricted
validity in the physical world.

In the decade after Dirac’s 1938 paper, a few works
[35,40,42,43,45,49] appeared that commented on the con-
cept of a limiting ﬁeld strength, typically in classical dis-
cussions of electron-positron pair creation. In sec. 3.2 we
return to the issue of pair creation, but in a quantum
context.

After the discovery of pulsars in 1967 there was a burst
of interest in the behavior of electrons in very strong mag-
netic ﬁelds. Several papers appeared in which classical
electrodynamics was applied [66,70,71,73,74,76,77,81], of-
ten with the intent of clarifying the boundary between
the classical and quantum domains. For very large ﬁelds,
classical solutions to the motion were obtained in which
the electron has a damping time constant that is small
compared to the period of cyclotron motion. Whether

or not such highly damped solutions are “implausible”,
they are outside ordinary experience. Again, one must
perform experiments to decide whether the classical the-
ory is valid in this domain. If such experiments had been
possible prior to the development of quantum mechan-
ics, they would have revealed deviations from the classi-
cal theory that would have encouraged development of a
new theory. Arguments such as those leading to eqs. (7),
(9) and (11) would have motivated the experiments.

B. Another Strong-Field Regime

Are there any other domains in which classical electro-

dynamics might be called into question?

Another interpretation of Lorentz’ criterion (8) is that
the amplitude of the oscillatory motion of an electron in
a wave of frequency ω should be small compared to the
wavelength. As is well known (see prob. 2, sec. 47 of
Ref. [9]), this leads to the condition that the dimension-
less, Lorentz-invariant quantity,

η =

eErms
mωc

,

(12)

should be small compared to one. Parameter η can ex-
ceed unity for waves of very low ﬁeld strength if the fre-
quency is low enough. An interesting result is that the
electron can be said to have an eﬀective mass,

meﬀ = mp1 + η2,

(13)

when inside a wave ﬁeld [134]. An electron in a spatially
varying wave experiences a force F = −∇meﬀc2 which is
often called the “ponderomotive force”, but which can be
regarded as a kind of radiation pressure for a case where
the “reﬂected” wave cannot be distinguished from the
incident wave, and hence as a kind of radiation reaction
force in its broadest meaning.

Debates continue regarding energy-transfer mecha-
nisms between electrons and strong classical waves (as
represented by a laser beam with η >
∼ 1). To what extent
can net energy be exchanged between a free electron and
a laser pulse in vacuum? Does a classical discussion suf-
ﬁce? Our understanding suggests that quantum aspects
should be unimportant even for η ≫ 1 so long as con-
dition (11) is satisﬁed, but full understanding has been
elusive. Detailed discussion of this matter is deferred to
a future article.

C. Utility of the Classical Radiation Reaction

Besides provoking extensive discussion on the valid-
ity of classical electrodynamics, the radiation reaction
has enjoyed some well-known success in classical phe-
nomenology. In particular, the topics of linewidth of ra-
diation by a classical oscillator and resonance width in

4

scattering of waves oﬀ such an oscillator show how par-
tial understanding of atomic systems can be obtained in
a classical context. Also, the radiation reaction is very
important in antenna engineering where the power source
must provide for the energy (and momentum, if any) ra-
diated as well as that consumed in Joule losses.
It is
worth noting that these successes hold where the elec-
tron is part of an extended system.

In contrast, the radiation reaction has been almost
completely negligible in descriptions of the radiation of
free electrons for practical parameters in the classical do-
main (i.e., outside the domain of quantum mechanics).
That this might be the case is the main argument of
sec. 2. Section 3 discusses eﬀects of the radiation reac-
tion in the quantum domain.

D. Relativistic Radiation Reaction

For purposes of additional commentary, it is useful to
record relativistic expressions for the radiation reaction.

The relativistic version of (1) in 4-vector notation is

Equations (17-18) were ﬁrst given by Abraham [19].
Von Laue [24] was the ﬁrst to show that these equa-
tions can be obtained by a Lorentz transformation of the
nonrelativistic results (19-20). The covariant notation of
eqs. (14-16) was ﬁrst applied to the radiation reaction by
Dirac [37]. An interesting discussion of the development
of eqs. (17-18) has been given recently by Yaghjian [110].

E. Terminology

During a century of discussion of the radiation reac-
tion a variety of terminology has been employed. In this
article I use the phrase “radiation reaction” to cover all
aspects of the physics of “R¨uckwirkung der Strahlung”
as introduced by Lorentz and Abraham. This usage con-
trasts with a proposed narrow interpretation discussed at
the end of this section.

“Æthereal friction” was the ﬁrst description by Stewart
[16] in 1871, which he used in only a qualitative manner.
In 1873, Maxwell wrote on the “pressure exerted by

light” in secs. 792-793 of his Treatise [10].

Lorentz used the French word “r´esistance” in describ-
ing eq. (3) when he presented it in 1892, and used the
English equivalent “resistance” in his 1906 Columbia lec-
tures [6].

Planck [7,17] also discussed eq. (3), which he de-
scribed as “D¨ampfung” (damping) and “D¨ampfung
durch Strahlung” (literally, “damping by radiation” but
translated more smoothly as “radiation damping”). The
term “Strahlungsd¨ampfung” (radiation damping) does
not, however, appear in the German literature until 1933
[34].

Around 1900, Larmor [22] used the terms “frictional
resistance” and “ray pressure” to describe a result meant
to quantify Stewart’s insight, but which analysis has not
stood the test of time.

The massive analyses of Abraham were accompanied
by the introduction of several new terms. The ti-
tle of Abraham’s 1904 article [19] included the term
“Strahlungsdruck” (radiation pressure). This use of the
phrase “radiation pressure” can, however, be confused
with the simpler concept of the pressure that results when
a wave is reﬂected from a conducting surface [10]. Per-
haps for this reason, Abraham also introduced the phrase
“Reaktionskraft der Strahlung”, which I translate as “ra-
diation reaction force”. This appears to be the origin of
the phrase “radiation reaction”, although in German that
phrase remained a qualiﬁer to “Kraft” (force) for many
years. The variant “Strahlungsreaktion” (radiation reac-
tion) appeared for the ﬁrst time in 1933 [35].
Lorentz’ 1903 Encyklop¨adie article [5]

introduced
the topic of the radiation reaction with the phrase
“R¨uckwirkung des ¨Athers” (back interaction of the
æther). In his 1905 monograph [90], Abraham used the

variant “R¨uckwirkung der Strahlung” (back interaction
of radiation, which could also be translated agreeably as
“radiation reaction”).

In England in 1908, the Adams Prize examiners chose
the topic of the radiation reaction, suggesting the cum-
bersome title “The Radiation from Electric Systems or
Ions in Accelerated Motion and the Mechanical Reactions
on their Motion which arise from it”. The winning essay
by Schott [26] adopted much of this title, but in the text
Schott refers to “radiation pressure” and indicates that
he follows Abraham in this. In his 1915 article, Schott
[27] also used the phrase “reaction due to radiation” and
indicated that it was equivalent to his use of the phrase
“radiation pressure”.

Schott also introduced other terms that seem less than
ideal descriptions of the phenomena associated with the
radiation reaction. His argument of 1912 [26] is less crisp
than one he gave in 1915 [27], so I follow the latter here.
Schott considered the rate at which a radiating charge
loses energy, and deduced eq. (17) in essentially that
form. Schott noted that term R is just the rate of ra-
diation of energy by an accelerated charge, which he de-
scribed as an “irreversible” process. He then interpreted
the term

Q =

2γ4e2v · ˙v

3c3

,

(21)

as an energy stored “in the electron in virtue of its ac-
celeration” and gave it the name “acceleration energy”.
Schott considered the term ˙Q in eq. (17) to be a “re-
versible” loss of energy.

Insights related to the concept of the “acceleration
energy” have been useful in resolving the paradox of
whether a charge radiates if its acceleration is uniform,
i.e., if ¨v = 0. In this case the radiation reaction force (3)
vanishes and many people have argued that this means
there is no radiation [25,31,92,131]. But as ﬁrst argued by
Schott [27], in the case of uniform acceleration “the en-
ergy radiated by the electron is derived entirely from its
acceleration energy; there is as it were internal compensa-
tion amongst the diﬀerent parts of its radiation pressure,
which causes its resultant eﬀect to vanish”. This view is
somewhat easier to follow if “acceleration energy” means
energy stored in the near and induction zones of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld [52,99].

Schott’s use of the word “irreversible” to describe the
process of radiation seems inapt. He may have meant
that in a classical universe containing only one electron
and an external force ﬁeld, the radiated energy can never
return to the electron. But as noted by Planck [132], “the
fundamental equations of mechanics as well as those of
electrodynamics allow the direct reversal of every pro-
cess as regards time”. For example, “if we now con-
sider any radiation processes whatsoever, taking place in
a perfect vacuum enclosed by reﬂecting walls, it is found
that, since they are completely determined by the prin-
ciples of classical electrodynamics, there can be in their
case no question of irreversibility of any kind”. However,

“an irreversible element is introduced by the addition of
emitting and absorbing substance”. Thus, consistent use
of the word “irreversible” goes beyond classical electron
theory. These views of Planck were seconded by Ein-
stein [133] and elaborated upon in the absorber theory
of radiation of Wheeler and Feynman [95].

As another counterexample to the view that radia-
tion is irreversible, a theme of contemporary accelerator
physics is that every radiation process can be inverted to
produce energy gain, not loss. Hence, there are now de-
vices that accelerate electrons based on inverse ˇCerenkov
radiation, inverse free-electron radiation, inverse Smith-
Purcell radiation, inverse transition radiation, etc. Uni-
form acceleration is the inverse of uniform deceleration,
and the inverse transformation is especially simple here:
since Fresist vanishes, it suﬃces to reverse the sign of the
external force. These inverse radiation processes will be
the subject of a future paper.

Schott’s use of “irreversible” as applied to the term
−Ruµ/c of the radiation reaction has not been followed
in the German literature. See Ref. [99] for an interesting
contrast.

The English phrase “radiation reaction” appears to

have been ﬁrst used by Page in 1918 [30].

In his 1938 paper, Dirac [37] used the phrase “the
eﬀect of radiation damping on the motion of the elec-
tron”. As a consequence, most subsequent papers use
“radiation damping” interchangeably with “radiation re-
action” as a general description of the subject. Thus, in
German there appeared the use of “Strahlungsd¨amfung”
[34] (already in 1933),
in French, “force de freinage”
[43] (braking force, compare “rayonnement freinage” =
Bremsstrahlung), and in Russian the equivalent of “radi-
ation damping” must have been used as well [9]. Dirac
seconded Schott’s use of the terms “irreversible” and “ac-
celeration energy”, and these become fairly common in
the English literature thereafter.
Indeed, “acceleration
energy” becomes “Schott acceleration energy”, or just
“Schott energy”.

The terminology of Schott and Dirac was taken a step
further by Rohrlich in 1961 [53] and 1965 [104], who pro-
posed that only the second term in the covariant expres-
sion (15) is entitled to be called “the radiation reaction”.
The ﬁrst term of (15) is to be called the “Schott term”.
A motivation for this terminology appears to be that in
the case of uniform acceleration, expression (15) vanishes
by virtue of cancellation of its two nonzero terms. Then
the broadly deﬁned “radiation reaction” (i.e., eq. (15))
vanishes, but the radiation does not (although it takes
considerable eﬀort to demonstrate this [52]). The termi-
nology of Rohrlich has the merit that the paradox “how
can there be radiation if there is no radiation reaction”
is avoided in this case since only the (nonvanishing) term
−Ruµ/c is called the “radiation reaction”.

However, this terminology is at odds with the origins
of the subject, which emphasize the low-velocity limit,
eqs. (19-20). Here, the radiated momentum enters only
in terms of order v2/c2, so the direct back reaction of

6

the radiated momentum (i.e., −Ruµ/c) plays no role in
the nonrelativistic limit. Thus, according to Rorhlich’s
terminology there is no “radiation reaction” in the non-
relativistic limit.

But the original, and continuing, purpose of the con-
cepts of the radiation reaction is to describe how a charge
reacts to the radiation of energy when it does not radiate
net momentum. To deﬁne the “radiation reaction” to be
zero in this circumstance is counterproductive.

It appears that the terminology of Rohrlich has been

adopted only by three subsequent workers [65,67,108].

III. A QUANTUM INTERPRETATION

To go further, we pass beyond the realm of classical
electromagnetism. The remainder of this paper is not a
direct consequence of that theory, but considers how only
a modest admixture of quantum concepts greatly clariﬁes
the hints deduced by classical argument.

A simple device is to multiply and divide eq. (7) by
Planck’s constant ¯h, which was introduced by him [130]
shortly after his work on eq. (1) [7]. Then we can write

¯h
mc

Fresist ≈ Fexts(cid:18) e2
c(cid:19)2
+(cid:18) e2
≈ αFexts(cid:18) λC
λ (cid:19)2
Ecrit(cid:19)2
+(cid:18) E

¯hc

e¯h

m2c3 E(cid:19)2

ω

¯hc

,

(22)

where α = e2/¯hc is the QED ﬁne structure constant,
λC = ¯h/mc is the reduced Compton wavelength of an
electron and

Ecrit =

m2c3
e¯h

= 1.6 × 1016 V/cm = 3.3 × 1013 Gauss

(23)

is the QED critical ﬁeld strength, discussed in sec. 3.2
below.

Thus, our na¨ıve quantum theory (classical electromag-
netism plus ¯h) leads us to expect important departures
from classical electromagnetism for waves of wavelength
much shorter than the Compton wavelength of the elec-
tron, and for ﬁelds of strength larger than the QED crit-
ical ﬁeld strength.

A. The Radiation Reaction and Compton Scattering

Compton scattering [135] was one of the earlier pre-
dictions of quantum theory and its observation had an
important historical role in widespread acceptance of
photons as quanta of light. Compton scattering is dis-
tinguished from Thomson scattering of classical electro-
magnetism in that wavelengths of the photons involved
in Compton scattering are not small compared to the

7

Compton wavelength of the electron, when measured in
the frame in which the electron is initially at rest. Hence
Compton scattering appears to be exactly the kind of
example discussed above in which the radiation reaction
should be important.

A description of a quantum scattering experiment re-
lates the energy and momentum (plus relevant internal
quantum numbers) of the initial state to those of the ﬁnal
state without discussion of forces. Yet, we can identify
various correspondences between the quantum and clas-
sical descriptions.

In the case of Compton scattering, the initial photon
corresponds to the external force ﬁeld on the electron,
while the ﬁnal photon corresponds to the radiated wave.
The quantum changes in momentum (and energy) of the
electron in the scattering process can be said to corre-
spond to classical time integrals of force (and of F · v).
Conservation of momentum (and energy) is described in
the scattering process by including the back reaction of
the ﬁnal photon on the electron as well as the direct
reaction of the initial photon. Thus, the quantum de-
scription, which incorporates conservation of momentum
(and energy), can be said to include automatically the
(time-integrated) eﬀects of the radiation reaction.

Compton scattering is an electromagnetic scattering
process in which large changes in momentum (and en-
ergy) of the electron are observed (in the frame in which
the electron is initially at rest). It can therefore be said to
correspond to a situation in which the radiation reaction
is large, in agreement with the semiclassical inferences of
secs. 2 and 3.

The correspondence between quantum conservation of
energy and the classical radiation reaction appears to in-
volve only the second term, −Ruµ/c, in expression (15)
for the radiation-reaction force. Since the electron has
constant (though diﬀerent) initial and ﬁnal velocities in
a scattering experiment, the “acceleration energy” Q of
eq. (21) is zero both before and after the scattering, and
˙Q cannot be expected to appear in the
the equivalent of
quantum description (at “tree level”, in the technical jar-
gon) of Compton scattering.

Eﬀects corresponding to the near-ﬁeld “acceleration
energy” can be said to occur in quantum electrodynamics
in the case of so-called vertex corrections and propagator
(mass) corrections, in which a virtual photon is emitted
and absorbed by the same electron. These “loop correc-
tions” to the behavior of a quantum point charge imple-
ment the equivalent of the self interaction of an extended
charge, but diverge when the emission and absorption
occur at the same spacetime point. They are the source
of the famous inﬁnities of QED that are dealt with by
“renormalization”. See also sec. 4.1 below.

In the early 1940’s, Heitler [136,93] and coworkers
[137,138] formulated a version of QED in which radia-
tion damping played a prominent role. Following the
suggestion of Oppenheimer [8], they hoped that this the-
ory would provide a general method of dealing with the

divergences of QED. By selecting a subset of “loop cor-
rections”, they deduced an expression for Compton scat-
tering that corresponds to classical Thomson scattering
plus classical radiation damping. While this result is sug-
gestive, it does not appear to be endorsed in detail by
subsequent treatments of “renormalization” in QED.

B. The Critical Field

The second term under the radical in eq. (22) may be
less familiar. The concept of a critical ﬁeld in quantum
mechanics began with Klein’s paradox [139]: an electron
that encounters an (electric) potential step appears to
be reﬂected with greater than unit probability in Dirac’s
theory.

Sauter [140] noted that this eﬀect arises only when
the potential gradient is larger than the critical ﬁeld,
m2c3/e¯h. The resolution of the paradox is due to Heisen-
berg and Euler [141], who noted that electrons and
positrons can be spontaneously produced in critical ﬁelds
– a very extreme form of the radiation reaction. The crit-
ical ﬁeld has been discussed at a sophisticated level by
Schwinger [142] and by Brezin and Itzykson [143], among
many others.

An electron that encounters an electromagnetic wave
of critical strength produces not only Compton scatter-
ing of the wave photons but also electron-positron pairs.
These eﬀects have recently been observed in experiments
in which the author participated [144,145].

There is speculation that critical magnetic ﬁelds exist
at the surface of neutron stars [146–148], and may be
responsible for some aspects of pulsar radiation.

Pomeranchuk [40] noted that the Earth’s magnetic
ﬁeld appears to have critical strength from the point of
view of an electron of energy 1019 eV, which energy is at
the upper limit of observation of cosmic rays.

The critical ﬁeld arises in discussion of the radiation,
commonly called synchrotron radiation, of electrons mov-
ing in circular orbits under the inﬂuence of a magnetic
If an electron of laboratory energy E ≫ mc2
ﬁeld B.
moves in an orbit with angular velocity ω0, then the char-
acteristic frequency of the synchrotron radiation is

ω ≈ γ3ω0,

(24)

where γ = E/mc2 is the Lorentz boost to the rest frame
of the electron. For motion in a magnetic ﬁeld B, the
cyclotron frequency ω0 can be written

¯hω0 =

mc2B
γBcrit

,

(25)

where Bcrit = m2c3/e¯h. Thus, the characteristic energy
of synchrotron-radiation photons (often called the critical
energy) is

¯hω ≈ E

γB
Bcrit

.

(26)

8

Hence an electron radiates away roughly 100% of its en-
ergy in a single synchrotron-radiation photon if the mag-
netic ﬁeld in the electron’s rest frame, B⋆ = γB, has
critical ﬁeld strength. In this regime a classical theory of
synchrotron radiation is inadequate [149,150].

Critical electric ﬁelds can be created for short times
in the collision of nonrelativistic heavy ions, resulting in
positron production [151–153].

As a ﬁnal example of the inapplicability of classical
electromagnetism in strong ﬁelds, the performance of fu-
ture high-energy electron-positron colliders will be lim-
ited by the disruptive (quantum) eﬀect of the critical
ﬁelds experienced by one bunch of charge as it passes
through the oncoming bunch [154].

IV. DISCUSSION

In this paper I have followed the example of Landau
in using the argument of sec. 2 to suggest limitations to
the concepts of classical electrodynamics. However, this
line of argument appears to have played no role in the
early development of quantum mechanics. Rather, the
argument was used in the 1930’s to suggest that quan-
tum electrodynamics might have conceptual limitation
when carried beyond the leading order of approximation
[8,141,155–159]. The history of this era has been well
reviewed in the recent book by Schweber [160].

While the program of renormalization, of which
Lorentz was an early advocate in the classical context [6],
appears to have been successful in eliminating the formal
divergences that were so troublesome in the 1930’s, quan-
tum electrodynamics is still essentially untested for ﬁelds
in excess of the critical ﬁeld strength (23) [145]. It still
may be the case that this realm contains new physical
phenomena that will validate the cautionary argument
of Oppenheimer [8].

We close with three examples to stimulate additional
discussion. Two are from strong-ﬁeld electrodynamics;
while not necessarily suggesting defects in the theory,
they indicate that not all aspects of QED are integrated
in the most familiar presentations. The third example
considers the case of extraordinarily short wavelengths.

A. The Mass Shift of an Accelerated Charge

We can rewrite the nonrelativistic expressions (1-3) for

the radiation reaction as

d

dt(cid:18)mv −

2e2 ˙v

3c3 (cid:19) = Fext,

and the relativistic expressions (14-16) as

d

ds(cid:18)mc2uµ −

2e2
3

duµ

ds (cid:19) = F µ

ext −

Ruµ

c

.

(27)

(28)

These forms suggest the interpretation that the momen-
tum, mv, of a moving charge is decreased by amount
2e2 ˙v/3c2 if that charge is accelerating as well [52,53].

If we take mc as the scale of the ordinary momen-
tum, then the eﬀect of acceleration, eE/m, due to an
electric ﬁeld E becomes large in eq. (27) only when
E >
0, i.e., when the electric ﬁeld is large
compared to the classical critical ﬁeld found in sec. 2.

∼ m2c4/e3 = e/r2

This interpretation has been seconded by Ritus [161]
based on a semiclassical analysis (classical electromag-
netic ﬁeld, quantum electron) of the behavior of electrons
in a strong, uniform electric ﬁeld. He ﬁnds that the mass
of an electron (= eigenvalue of the mass operator) obeys

m = m0(cid:18)1 −

αE

2Ecrit

+ O(E2/E2

crit)(cid:19) ,

(29)

and remarks on the relation between this result and the
classical interpretations (27-28). The mass shift of an
accelerated charge becomes large when E >
∼ Ecrit/α =
e/r2

0, as found above.
The physical meaning of Ritus’ result remains some-
what unclear. For example, a mass shift of the form (29)
does not appear in Ritus’ treatment of Compton scatter-
ing in intense wave ﬁelds [162] (which treatment agrees
with other works), although the eﬀective mass (13) does
appear.

B. Hawking-Unruh Radiation

where a⋆ is the acceleration as measured in the observer’s
instantaneous rest frame.

The Hawking-Unruh temperature ﬁnds application in
accelerator physics as the reason that electrons in a stor-
age ring do not reach 100% polarization despite emitting
polarized synchrotron radiation [166]. Indeed, the vari-
ous limiting features of performance of a storage ring that
arise due to quantum ﬂuctuations of the synchrotron ra-
diation can be understood quickly in terms of eq. (31)
[167].

Here we consider a more speculative example. Suppose
the observer is an electron accelerated by an electromag-
netic ﬁeld E. Then, scattering of the electron oﬀ photons
in the apparent thermal bath would be interpreted by a
laboratory observer as an extra contribution to the ra-
diation rate of the accelerated charge [168]. The power
of the extra radiation, which I call Unruh radiation, is
given by

dUUnruh

dt

= (energy ﬂux of thermal radiation)

×(scattering cross section).

(32)

For the scattering cross section, we use the well-known
result for Thomson scattering, σThomson = 8πr2
0/3. The
energy density of thermal radiation is given by the usual
expression of Planck:

dU
dν

=

8π
c3

hν3

ehν/kT − 1

,

(33)

According to Hawking [163], an observer outside a
black hole experiences a bath of thermal radiation of tem-
perature

where ν is the frequency. The ﬂux of the isotropic radi-
ation on the electron is just c times the energy density.
Note that these relations hold in the instantaneous rest
frame of the electron. Then

T =

(34)

(35)

where g is the local acceleration due to gravity and k is
Boltzmann’s constant. In some manner, the background
gravitational ﬁeld interacts with the quantum ﬂuctua-
tions of the electromagnetic ﬁeld with the result that en-
ergy can be transferred to the observer as if he(she) were
in an oven ﬁlled with black-body radiation. Of course,
the eﬀect is strong only if the background ﬁeld is strong.
An extreme example is that if the temperature is equiv-
alent to 1 MeV or more, virtual electron-positron pairs
emerge from the vacuum into real particles.

As remarked by Unruh [164], this phenomenon can be
demonstrated in the laboratory according to the princi-
ple of equivalence: an accelerated observer in a gravity-
free environment experiences the same physics (locally)
as an observer at rest in a gravitational ﬁeld. There-
fore, an accelerated observer (in zero gravity) should ﬁnd
him(her)self in a thermal bath of radiation characterized
by temperature

T =

(31)

using the Hawking-Unruh relation (31). The presence
of ¯h in eq. (35) reminds us that Unruh radiation is a
quantum eﬀect.
This equals

the classical Larmor

radiation rate,

dU/dt = 2e2a⋆2/3c3, when

E⋆ =r 60π

α

Ecrit ≈

Ecrit

α

,

(36)

where Ecrit is the QED critical ﬁeld strength introduced
in eq. (23). In this case, the acceleration a⋆ = eE⋆/m is
about 1031 Earth g’s.

The physical signiﬁcance of Unruh radiation remains
unclear. Sciama [169] has emphasized how the apparent
temperature of an accelerated observed should be inter-
preted in view of quantum ﬂuctuations. Unruh radiation

is a quantum correction to the classical radiation rate
that grows large only in situations where quantum ﬂuc-
tuations in the radiation rate become very signiﬁcant.
This phenomenon should be contained in the standard
theory of QED, but a direct demonstration of this is not
yet available. Likewise, the relation between Unruh ra-
diation and the mass shift of an accelerated charge, both
of which become prominent at ﬁelds of strength Ecrit/α,
is not yet evident.

The existence of Unruh radiation provides an interest-
ing comment on the “perpetual problem” of whether a
uniformly accelerated charge emits electromagnetic radi-
ation [63]; this issue has been discussed brieﬂy in sec. 2.5.
The interpretation of Unruh radiation as a measure of the
quantum ﬂuctuations in the classical radiation implies
that the classical radiation exists. It is noteworthy that
while discussion of radiation by an accelerated charge is
perhaps most intricate classically in case of uniform ac-
celeration, the discussion of quantum ﬂuctuations is the
most straightforward for uniform acceleration.

In addition, Hawking-Unruh radiation helps clarify a
residual puzzle in the discussion of the equivalence be-
tween accelerated charges and charges in a gravitational
ﬁeld. Because of the diﬃculty in identifying an unam-
biguous wave zone for uniformly accelerated motion of a
charge (in a gravity-free region) and also in the case of
a charge in a uniform gravitational ﬁeld, there remains
some doubt as to whether the ‘radiation’ deduced by
classical arguments contains photons. Thus, on p. 573
of the article by Ginzburg [63] we read: “neither a ho-
mogeneous gravitational ﬁeld nor a uniformly accelerated
reference frame can actually “generate” free particles, ex-
pecially photons”. We now see that the quantum view is
richer than anticipated, and that Hawking-Unruh radia-
tion provides at least a partial understanding of particle
emission in uniform acceleration or gravitation. Hence,
we can regard the concerns of Bondi and Gold [50], Ful-
ton and Rohrlich [52], the DeWitt’s [58] and Ginzburg
[63] on radiation and the equivalence principle as precur-
sors to the concept of Hawking radiation.

C. Can a Photon Be a Black Hole?

While quantum electrodynamics appears valid in all
laboratory studies so far, which have explored photons
energies up to the TeV energy scale, will this success con-
tinue at arbitrarily high energies (i.e., arbitrarily short
wavelengths)?

Consider a photon whose (reduced) wavelength λ is the

so-called Planck length [170],

LP =r ¯hG

c3

≈ 10−33 cm,

(37)

where G is Newton’s gravitational constant. The gravi-
tational eﬀect of such a photon is quite large. A measure
of this is the “equivalent mass”,

mequiv =

¯hω
c2 =

¯h
cλ

=

¯h
cLP

.

(38)

The Schwarzschild radius corresponding to this equiva-
lent mass is

R =

2Gmequiv

c2

=

2¯hGω
c3LP

= 2LP = 2λ.

(39)

A na¨ıve interpretation of this result is that a photon is a
black hole if its wavelength is less than the Planck length.
Among the scattering processes involving such a photon
and a charged particle would be the case in which the
charged particle is devoured by the photon, which would
increase the energy of the latter, making its wavelength
shorter still.

At very short wavelengths, electromagnetism and grav-
itation become intertwined in a manner that requires new
understanding. The current best candidate for the even-
tual theory that uniﬁes the fundamental interactions at
short wavelengths is string theory. Variants of the pre-
ceding argument are often used to motivate the need for
a new theory.

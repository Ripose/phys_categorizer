parts.

Abstract

A manifestly gauge-invariant hamiltonian formulation [1] of classi-
cal electrodynamics has been shown to be relativistic invariant by the
construction of the generators of the Poincar´e Lie algebra. The original
formulation in terms of reduced distribution functions for the particles
is applied here to the case of two charges interacting through the clas-
sical electrodynamical ﬁeld. A reduced description is also introduced
for describing the electric and magnetic transverse components of the
ﬁeld. In our quest towards the introduction of irreversibility at the fun-
damental level of description [2], we have introduced a reformulation of
ﬁeld theory without self-energy parts that enables to take properly into
account all processes associated with self-energy in a kinetic operator,
while keeping the equivalence with the original description [3]. Aston-
ishingly, the combination of both approaches provides a divergence-free
formulation of classical electrodynamics. The derivation of the radia-
tive reaction force is possible in a routine straightforward way and its
relativistic expression is given.

Introduction

The derivation of an equation of motion of an electron that includes its
reaction to the self-ﬁeld has been initiated by Abraham and Lorentz hundred
years ago and is still a controversal matter [4], [5]. The main problem is the
presence of divergences associated with point-like charged particles. A way
of removing them has to be devised without entering in trouble with the
special theory of relativity. The derivation of the self-force based on energy
conservation [12] avoids that problem: the power emitted in the radiating
ﬁeld is responsible of the radiative reaction force.

A microscopic derivation is based usually on the potentials of Li´enard-
Wiechert associated with the moving charge placed at the origin R = 0.
Even in the absence of acceleration, a velocity ﬁeld behaving as R−2 can
be deduced from a static situation using a Lorentz transformation. The
self-ﬁelds are then derived and their expression used to get the reaction on
the motion of the charged particle. The derivation of the ﬁeld from the
potentials through derivation operations implies that they are computed
outside the particle and the limit R
0 considered later on. Since the
ﬁelds are singular for R = 0, the procedure of determining the potentials
and then the ﬁelds by derivation can be questioned: we have no insurance
that the double operation reproduces the original ﬁelds at a singular point.
A direct determination of the electromagnetic ﬁelds is preferable.

→

A theory of subdynamics has been introduced thirty years ago by the
Brussels group (see e.g. [6], [7]) for a dynamics provided by the Liouville-von
Neuman equation. A set back of that approach is a limitation on the class
of possible initial conditions since they have to belong to the subdynam-
ics. To avoid the trap, we have introduced the so-called single subdynamics
approach [dHG00] based on the existence of self-energy contributions to
the dynamics. In that way, we obtain a reformulation of ﬁeld theory that
excludes self-energy contributions in the dynamics. However, being able
to accommodate also initial conditions outside the scope of the original dy-
namics: our dynamics is larger that the initial formulation. Since the formal
properties of the subdynamics do not depend on a particular realisation of
the operators, we have picked up all the formal properties without a need to
redemonstrate them. The so-called single subdynamics approach has been
illustrated ﬁrst in a quantal non relativistic framework [8], [9], [10], [3], [2].
All the claimed formal properties have been subject to an explicit check for
the exactly soluble models.

The ideas at its basis can also be applied in the present classical rela-

1

tivistic context. A statistical description of the classical charged particles
and of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is required. Fortunately, a manifestly gauge-
invariant hamiltonian formulation [1] has been developed for point particles
and ﬁelds, described now by reduced distribution functions. The relativis-
tic invariance is proved by the explicit construction of the generators of
the Poincar´e Lie algebra. The dynamical variables are the positions and
mechanical momentums for the charged point particles and the transverse
components of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds: the potentials do not appear
in that formulation and the delicate point outlined above is automatically
avoided. The Coulomb interaction takes into account the longitudinal part
of the electric ﬁeld. The formalism looks formally as a statistical description
of charged particles in Coulomb gauge but with a diﬀerent interpretation and
the certainty of satisfying the principle of special relativity.

While Balescu and Poulain have developed their formalism for an arbi-
trary number of particles, described by reduced distribution functions, we
can apply it as such in the simplest case of two charged point particles. They
thus interact through the Coulomb interaction and the classical transverse
electrodynamical ﬁeld (electric and magnetic). An alternative possibility is
to consider a single charge in interaction with a coulombian potential (due
for instance to an inﬁnitely massive particle) at the origin of the coordinates
but the translation invariance is then immediately broken. At the ﬁnal stage,
we will consider the limit of our expressions when one of the two particles
becomes very massive. Working with two particles avoids the consideration
of an external force to accelerate the particles: the relativistic and gauge in-
variance is therefore preserved. The consideration of an incident transverse
ﬁeld is also relevant to the problem but is not treated here.

The Balescu-Poulain formulation seems therefore an adequate starting
point to deal with classical electrodynamics thanks to its intrinsic properties:
namely relativistic invariance, explicit gauge invariance. The formulation is
statistical: the particles and the modes of the ﬁeld are described by distri-
bution functions. The distribution functions associated with the particles
can be spatially extended. A particle does not interact with the electric lon-
gitudinal ﬁeld its generates: the coulombian interaction is considered only
between diﬀerent particles.

The adequate way of dealing with the self-ﬁeld is provided automati-
cally by the single subdynamics approach. The dynamics is ﬁrst extended
to be able to distinguish the self-ﬁeld contributions from the other. A sub-
dynamics, inspired by the formalism developed at Brussels [7] enables the
obtention of dynamical equations of motion in which the self-ﬁeld does no

2

longer appear. It has been proven [3] that the obtained description contains
in an exact way the original description and that the eﬀects of the self-ﬁeld
are now present in the new generator of motion. The relevant subdynamics
incorporates all the features of usual CED. That description therefore in-
cludes not only the original dynamics but could also include a more general
class of initial conditions, enabling the inclusion of irreversibility at a fun-
damental level. Nevertheless, the consideration of initial conditions beyond
the equivalence conditions requires that the generators of the Poincar´e Lie
algebra be constructed for the extended dynamics and that point is beyond
our aim in this paper. However, we believe that the distinction between the
self-ﬁeld and the external ﬁeld resists a Lorentz transformation and there-
fore no problem should arise from the extension of dynamics. Moreover, the
subdynamics operator Π has been proved (in another realisation but within
a similar framework) by R. Balescu and L. Brenig [18] to be relativisti-
cally invariant. Nevertheless, as far as the adequate construction of the Lie
brackets for the ten generators of the Lorentz group has not been performed,
we have to restrict ourself to the equivalence case. When the compatible
(or equivalence) conditions are fulﬁlled, the new dynamics is simply a re-
formulation of the original one. We deliberately restrict ourselves to the
derivation of the closed irreversible evolution equations for the interacting
charged particles, in the vacuum of incident ﬁeld from an outside source,
and to the obtention of the emitted ﬁelds (velocity and acceleration ﬁelds)
at the lowest non-vanishing order.

The next section is devoted to the presentation of the Balescu-Poulain’s
formalism. The basic idea for constructing the single subdynamics in CED
is the use of a distinction between real and virtual ﬁelds (the virtual ﬁeld
forms the self-ﬁeld). We propose an extension of the dynamics suitable for
our purpose and the constitutive relations that connects the original and
extended dynamics. The elements ot the extended dynamics bear a tilde
accent.

The kinetic operator ˜Θ is considered in the next section 3. The ﬁrst non-
vanishing contribution appears at the second order in the interaction with
the transverse ﬁelds, without considering, in the ﬁrst step, the inﬂuence
of the coulombian interaction between the charged particles. We are not
interested here in the evolution of the ﬁeld but focus on the reaction of
the particles to the presence of the ﬁeld, including the radiative corrections.
Therefore, to provide a contribution to the evolution of the two-particle
distribution function, we consider only the elements of the operator that
acts on the (reduced) distribution function of the two charged particles and

3

one mode of the ﬁeld. These elements determine the radiative correction to
the direct interaction between the particles and the ﬁeld. When acting on
the distribution function corresponding to the vacuum of ﬁeld (deﬁned in
the extended dynamics), they will determine the radiative correction to the
free motion of the particles.

The elements of the kinetic operator are evaluated from the correspond-
ing vacuum-vacuum elements of the subdynamics operator ˜Σ(t) . The var-
ious steps of the derivation are illustrated and the ﬁnal expression for ˜Θ is
given in Appendix B. All the elements are known to examine the putative
second order mass correction for the charged particles Indeed, the concept
of renormalized mass has now to be extracted from the kinetic equation,
by combining radiative corrections with the free motion operator. Our ex-
pression of the kinetic operator shows that, for a free particle that is not
accelerated by outside ﬁelds nor a coulombian interaction, the second order
contribution vanishes and provides no mass correction. This result could be
expected from general considerations from our knowledge of general proper-
ties of the subdynamics [6]: the propagator involved cannot be resonnant if
a relativistic expression is used for the energy of the particle: the momentum
and energy conservations cannot be simultaneously satisﬁed by an emission
act of a non-accelerated charged particle. In Brussels terminology [6], the
second order kinetic operator vanishes for parity reasons: it is well known
that, at that second order, the contribution to the kinetic operator (called
ψ2) arises from a Dirac delta “function” and not from the principal part
of the (usually regularised by a iǫ) propagator. Here, no regularisation is
required when acting on the ﬁeld vacuum and the kinetic operator provides
a vanishing contribution. This is at odd with the usual result where a mass
correction is obtained for the ”velocity “ ﬁelds ((14.14) in
14 of [12], see
also
16) . Since we have the claims that Balescu-Poulain formulation is
§
equivalent to the classical electrodynamics and that our single subdynamics
approach contains the Balescu-Poulain description, a detailed explanation
has to be provided for the diﬀerences (zero in place of a divergence). At this
stage, we simply take note of the contradictory results.

§

A non-vanishing contributions to the kinetic operator, reﬂecting the pres-
ence of the eﬀect of the transverse self-ﬁeld, requires to consider either a non-
vanishing incident transverse ﬁeld, either a coulombian interaction between
the charged particles or either the mutual inﬂuence of the transverse emitted
ﬁeld: the particle has to be accelerated to receive a radiation reaction force.
This is the objet of a later section.

To understand the origin of the discrepancy, we take another road. The

4

kinetic operator can indeed be evaluated from diﬀerent approaches. In
4, we
§
focus on the so-called creation operator determining the self-ﬁeld. The value
of the self-ﬁeld at the location of the particle determines its self-interaction.
Since the equivalence conditions require the equality of the emitted and self-
ﬁeld, the creation operator provides us moreover with the expression of the
emitted ﬁeld. Correlation-vacuum elements of the resolvent are considered
for evaluating the elements of the subdynamics. A simple computation en-
ables to get explicitly the expression of the common value of the emitted and
self-ﬁeld. At ﬁrst order in the ﬁeld interaction, without taking the coulom-
bian interaction into account, the expression the ﬁeld at the point x, due to
1
the presence of the charged particle at point qj, behaves obviously as
|x−qj|2
and does not describe a propagating ﬁeld but a velocity ﬁeld. It presents
a discontinuity and vanishes exactly at the location of the particle x = qj
since the integrand is identically null for that value. This explains why the
corresponding terms in the kinetic operator Θ vanish. The usual (relativis-
tic) expression is recovered outside the location of the particle x = qj. As
already outlined above, in the usual approaches for deriving the radiation
damping, the ﬁelds are computed from the Li´enard-Wiechert potential and
evaluated at the localisation of the charged point particle. The obtention
of the Li´enard-Wiechert potential has required an integration and the ob-
tention of the ﬁeld from it implies a derivative. These operations are not
necessarily the inverse one of each other in presence of singular points. In our
approach, the contribution of each mode is computed directly at the local-
isation of the charged particle and the summation over all the ﬁelds modes
is performed later on. The diﬀerence in the order of the limits explain the
discrepancy in the results from two formalisms claimed to be equivalent:
the singular points of the self-ﬁeld are not treated in a similar way. We
believe that our order is the natural one and provides indeed a ﬁnite result.
Therefore, the requirement of an external stress tensor (See references cited
in [12]) to get a relativistic model for the electron to ensure the stability
of a spatially extended charged particle, by counterbalancing the Coulomb
force, is unnecessary.

To obtain a source of acceleration and in order to prepare an easy com-
parison with the usal approaches, the ﬁrst order eﬀect of the Coulomb ac-
celeration is computed in
6 from two diﬀerent ways: the direct
§
consideration of the kinetic operator and the recourse to the creation oper-
ator for the self-ﬁeld.

5 and
§

The direct computation of the kinetic operator is performed in the next

5

section
5 from the vacuum-vacuum elements of the resolvent acting on the
§
vacuum of ﬁeld. All relative orders of the vertices have to be considered: the
coulombian interaction can a priori take place before, after or in between the
two interactions with the transverse ﬁeld. Only the last two circonstances
lead to a non-vanishing contribution. Indeed, when the coulombian inter-
action takes place before the two interactions with the transverse ﬁeld, we
receive as factor, as expected, the previous second order contribution to the
kinetic operator. The computation, although lenghty, is straightforward.

For a consistency check, in

6 we consider the creation operator at ﬁrst
§
order in ﬁeld-particle interaction and ﬁrst order in the coulombian interac-
tion. This enables to get the eﬀect of the acceleration, due to the coulombian
interaction, to the self-ﬁeld, hence to the retroaction of the emitted ﬁeld on
the accelerated particle. From the equivalence conditions, we deduce for
all points the ﬁeld emitted during the acceleration of the particle. If we use
that expression in the kinetic equation, we recover the previous result. From
its expression at the localisation of the particle, the power emitted can be
computed.

Our expressions are analysed in

7. We consider a situation in which
§
the distribution functions of the charged particles are inﬁnitely sharp in
conﬁguration and momentum space, with a vacuum of free ﬁeld. From
the kinetic operator, an explicit, ﬁnite, expression of the radiation reaction
force is then obtained by considering the time derivative of the mean value
of the momentum. The usual result is recovered as a particular case in
small velocities circonstances.
Indeed, under the equivalence conditions,
both theories have to provide the same equations for the motion of the
charged particles but the interpretation is somehow diﬀerent.

Some conclusions and perspectives are considered in the last section

8.
§

2 The description of the charges and of the elec-

tromagnetic ﬁeld

We deﬁne in this section the model for the description of the two charges in
interaction with the electromagnetic ﬁeld. We can use directly the approach
by R. Balescu and M. Poulain [1], in particular the results of the seventh
section. The only diﬀerence is that for the description of matter, we do
not deal with a reduced formalism but keep the two-particle distribution
function. Although the transposition is straightforward, we will explicit it,
using their notations and their logica (and expressions whenever possible).

The state of the system is described by a distribution vector

, i.e. by
a collection of functions describing two diﬀerent particles and the reduced
distribution of m ﬁeld oscillators, describing the transverse ﬁeld components
which are the only ones that appear explicitly:

1In opposition with [13], the reduction is not performed up to the level of each polar-
ized mode, in the same way that reduced distribution functions for the particles are not
considered to only one component of the velocity. This procedure ensures more easily the
rotationnal invariance of the treatment.

We proceed now to an enlargement of dynamics [15], [3]: we multiply
the number of variables on physical ground in such a way that the origi-
nal dynamics ( 2.7) be included as a particular case. The elements of the
enlarged dynamics will be noted by a supplementary upper index tilde “˜”,
as well for the variables as for the evolution operator. Our aim is indeed
to eliminate explicit self-interaction processes from the evolution, while tak-
ing their eﬀect into account. We distinguish formally between 5 varieties
of oscillators, based on the recognition of self-energy parts in the evolution.
To each oscillator [i], we associate a discrete index that determines which

9

interactions are possible for the oscillator (the index j takes the two values
1 and 2).
[i(sj)] will be the label of an oscillator which has previously interacted with
the particle j and will further interact with it in a future, without interaction
with the other particle (j′
= j), and without playing a role in a measurement:
by deﬁnition, such oscillator does not play a role in the computation of the
mean values.
[i(ej )] will be the label of an oscillator which has previously interacted with
the particle (j) and will no longer interact with it directly:
its next inter-
action should involve the other particle (j′), or it should contribute in the
computation of mean values.
[i(f )] will be the label of an oscillator mode which has not previously in-
teracted with the particles (1) or (2). Its excitation has its origin outside
the two charges and such an oscillator is free of constraints on its interac-
tions: either with one of the particle or with an external devise. It provide
a contribution in the computation of mean values.

The free evolution of those oscillators is the same as in the original

dynamics and does not involve a change in their nature.

For these terms that do not involve a ﬁeld oscillator, that equation is man-

this is compatible with the original equation, thanks to the constitutive re-
lations and to the numerical identiﬁcation of ˜f11[1s1] with ˜f11[1e1] inside the
equivalence relations. The other terms can be treated in a similar way.

That relation ( 2.20) can be easily generalised for two or more oscillators:

f11[2] = ˜f11[2(f f )] + ˜f11[2(e1f )] + ˜f11[2(e2f )] + ˜f11[2(f e1)] + ˜f11[2(e1e1)]

and similar expressions for the set of all elements

We now proceed to the construction of a subynamics associated with
the enlarged dynamics. First of all, we have to deﬁne the vacuum and
correlation states. A correlation state contains at least one self oscillator
while the vacuum (of correlation) is deﬁned as the set
where all
oscillators are of the free f and emitted e1 and e2 varieties. The construction
of the subdynamics rests on that distinction and all the formal results of the
Brussels group, concerning its construction rules and its formal properties,
can be applied directly, with our speciﬁc realisation of the operators involved.
We focus in the next section on the kinetic equations for the vacuum
components. For that purpose, we can limit ourselves to the consideration
of the vacuum-vacuum elements of the superoperator ˜Σ(t) [2], its t = 0
value deﬁning the ˜Π operator. We take for granted the usual properties of
idempotency, factorized structure and commutation of ˜Π with the evolution
operator ˜
. The explicit veriﬁcation of those properties requires the explicit
L
knowledge of all the elements of ˜Σ(t) [3].

The free ﬁelds variables are by deﬁnition not connected with the charged
particles variables. Therefore, the initial conditions concerning the free ﬁelds
and particles variables can be chosen as independent. The vacuum compo-
nents
can be factorized into a part, describing the particles and the
oscillators of the emitted e1 and e2 varieties, and a part describing the free
variety of the ﬁeld, for instance an incident ﬁeld that may be or not vanish-
ingly small. We shall therefore write for instance:

˜f11[i]}
{

˜f11[1(f )] = ˜f11[0]
˜f11[2(f f )] = ˜f11[0]
˜f11[2(e1f )] = ˜f11[1(e1)]

˜f[1(f )]
˜f[2(f f )]

˜f[1(f )]

( 2.26)

The free ﬁeld ˜f[1(f )] distribution function may be in particular the vac-
uum ﬁeld ˜f V
[1(f )] distribution function considered later on for the compu-
tation of the eﬀect of the self-ﬁeld on the motion of the charged parti-
cles. In the extended dynamics, the natural choice is to consider for ˜f V
[1(f )]
a distribution function corresponding to a ﬁeld of null amplitude and no

˜f11[0]
{

˜f[n(f f ...f )]}

In those circonstances, the function ˜f11[1(sj )] receive
phase dependance.
e.g. contributions form
directly through the creation op-

4). In the equivalence conditions, we have numerically that the functions
§
˜f11[1(sj )] and ˜f11[1(ej )] coincide. The constitutive relation ( 2.20) requires
that f11[1] = ˜f11[1(f )] + ˜f11[1(e1)] + ˜f11[1(e2)]. Therefore, in the original repre-
˜f V
sentation, we are not allowed to consider a factorization f11[1] = ˜f11[0]
[1(f )]
corresponding to the absence of ﬁeld at the time considered. If we impose
at some time f11[1] = ˜f11[0]
˜f V
[1(f )], at the same time, we have to consider
˜f11[1(f )] = f11[0]
˜f11[1(e2)]. Therefore, we have to admit the
˜f11[1(e1)] −
˜f V
[1(f )] −
presence in ˜f11[1(f )] of contributions
˜f11[1(e2)]. When computing

equation of the hierarchy ( 2.18). That contribution has to be combined
with the contribution arising from the kinetic operator ˜Θ. Under that im-
position f11[1] = ˜f11[0]
˜f V
[1(f )], it is mandatory to consider that contribution
to have a valid comparison with the usual results.

determination of the elements of ˜Θ in a successive way. The elements of ˜Θ

The prime on the integral sign means that only poles corresponding to prop-
agators arising to vacuum states (without self oscillators) have to be included

15

in the path c. In the present case, the pole due to the intermediate prop-
agator is thus excluded from the path. That selection of poles corresponds
to the recipe to construct the subdynamics. The accidental coincidence of
poles due to the correlation and vacuum propagators is avoided by adding
a positive imaginary inﬁnitesimal iǫ to the correlation propagators when
computing the residues. Another formulation of the recipe is the following:
a positive imaginary inﬁnitesimal iǫ is ﬁrst added to all propagators corre-
sponding to the correlation states and the path c encloses then the real axis,
iǫ. When no resonnance can occur, the iǫ can be dropped.
above

The evaluation is more easy in variables such that the free motion op-
erator is diagonal. For the free motion of particles, those variables are well
known and correspond to the Fourier transform of the original spatial vari-
ables. Therefore, we will replace the unknown ˜f11[0] where the variables
x(1), x(2) are (q(1), p(1)), (q(2), p(2)) by new functions depending on variables
(k(1), p(1)), (k(2), p(2)). We will not introduce a new symbol: the nature
of the argument precizes the function under consideration. The transition
between the two functions is provided by (we use Balescu’s choice for the
normalization factor):

All functions ˜f11[m] have to be similarly replaced.

We have to perform a similar change with respect to the variables as-

For pedagogical reasons, we show in Appendix A that under conditions
of independence (factorization) of the ﬁeld and one particle distribution
function, describing a particle sharply located at r(t), this expresson leads
to

B⊥(r(t)) > is the usual electromagnetic force acting
e < E⊥(r(t)) + v
on the particle. The minus sign is easily accounted.
If the distribution
function corresponds to a well deﬁned value of the velocity and an uniform

acceleration a, it can be written f (k, v, t)

We now explicit the operator < 11[0]

11[1(f )] >(0,2) ( 3.5) in the new

variables. The two interactions have to involve the same particle. We use
the same convention for the index of particles as for the polarisation of the
oscillators: j′ is 2 when j is 1 and vice versa. We get:

The summation over m[1]

From that expression, the computation of < 11[0]

11[1(f )] >(0,2) is

routine: we have to proceed formally to the derivatives with respect to the
mechanical momentums of the particle. A further index can be introduced
to reﬂect the factor on which they act. The last operation is an integral by
residue that takes into account the poles due to the ﬁrst and last propagators
that correspond to the vacuum of correlation. For the sake of illustration,
let us consider one of the contributions that will matter when acting on the
vacuum of free ﬁeld:

11[1(f )] >(0,2) enables in par-

ticular to look for the behaviour of the particles when evolving into the
vacuum of ﬁeld. Other matrix elements could also be considered to provide
the vertex (charge) renormalization due to the self-ﬁeld but are outside our
scope in this paper.

We can use the factorization ( 2.18):

˜f11[1(f )] = ˜f11[0]

˜f[1(f )],

( 3.22)

and use for ˜f[1(f )] the distribution function ˜f V

involved: we would then meet a product of Kronecker’s delta functions with
incompatible arguments. Therefore, the only possible non-vanishing would

˜Θ
[1(f )], the second order < 11[0]
|

This last expression vanishes obviously by parity for the summation over
a. The absence of a possible resonnance in the propagator is a key element
for that property. Therefore, we have proven that acting on the vacuum
of ﬁeld ˜f V
=6= evolution operator
vanishes. The impossibility for the process to be resonnant implies that no
iǫ is required and the propagor is odd in a. In the case of a resonnance, we
would get a delta-function like with an even parity. Therefore, no contri-
˜Θ
11[1(f )] >(0,2). The
bution to a mass renormalization arises from < 11[0]
|
|
eﬀect of the vacuum is therefore to be searched in other terms. Indeed, ra-
diation emisssion is present when the particles are accelerated. We consider
11[1(f )] >(1,2). The acceleration provided by
as a ﬁrst step in
|
the coulombian interaction will induce a back reaction on the motion of the
particles.

4 The correlation-vacuum elements of ˜Σ(t)

In order to get a better understanding of our previous result, we intend
to analyse the ﬁeld emitted by the particles at the same order (0,2) in
the interactions. We will use the equivalence conditions that enable to get
the emitted ﬁeld from the self-ﬁeld that can be computed with the help of
the so-called creation operator ˜C. Since we know that ˜Σ(t) = ˜Ce ˜Θt ˜
for
A
the correlation-vacuum elements, we focus on the elements of ˜Σ(t)(0,1) that
provides a contribution to

˜f11[1(isj )] =< 11[1(sj )]
˜C
|
˜C
+ < 11[1(sj )]
|
˜C
+ < 11[1(sj )]
|

11[1(ej′)] > ˜f11[1(ej′)]
|
11[2(f f )] > ˜f11[2(f f )] + . . .
|

11[1(f )] > ˜f11[1(f )]
|

( 4.1)

Since numerically, in the equivalence conditions, ˜f11[1(iej)] = ˜f11[1(isj )], the
lowest order contribution to ˜f11[1(isj )] requires < 11[1(sj )]
˜Σ(t)
11[1(f )] >(0,1)
|
|
that determines the lowest order contribution to the creation operator. Only
the terms that provide a contribution when acting on the vacuum of ﬁeld
are cojnsidered. In place of ( 3.15), we start from

11[1(f )] >(0,1) ˜f V
˜Σ(t)

This expression behaves obviously as
gating ﬁeld. It presents a discontinuity and vanishes exactly at the location
of the particle x = qj since the integrand is identically null for that value.
In view of ( 3.14), this explains why the corresponding terms in the kinetic
operator Θ vanishes.
In our approach, the contribution of each mode to
the self-interaction of the electron is computed ﬁrst. When no acceleration
mechanism is provided, each contribution vanishes exactly. In the usual ap-
proach, the emitted ﬁelds are computed from the Li´enard-Wiechert potential
and evaluated at the localisation of the electron. The diﬀerence in the or-
der of the limits explain the discrepancy in the results from two formalisms
claimed to be equivalent.

The expression for the electric ﬁeld can be further analysed. We can write

( 4.10) as the sum of two contributions by replacing

5 The radiative reaction force due to the coulom-

bian interaction

In order to get a contribution to the reactive force due to the self-interaction
of the particles, a mechanism of acceleration of the particles has to be pro-
vided. We have chosen to consider the Coulomb interaction between the

31

charged particles as responsible for the acceleration. Other mechanisms are
possible, such as the presence of a non-vanishing free ﬁeld, or the consid-
eration of the ﬁeld emitted by the other particles but they are not treated
here. We have to evaluate the elements of ˜Σ(t)(1,2) (corresponding to one
coulombian interaction and two interactions with the transverse ﬁelds) that
˜Θ
11[1(f )] >(1,2), when that operator acts
provide a contribution to < 11[0]
|
|
on the vacuum of ﬁeld. The coulombian interaction between the two parti-
cles can occur as the ﬁrst, the second or the last interaction. Since we know
˜Θ
11[1(f )] >(0,2) provides a vanishing result when acting on the
that < 11[0]
|
|
vacuum, we expect that the only non vanishing contribution arises when the
coulombian interaction takes place between or after the interaction of the
particles with the transverse ﬁeld. Therefore, we ﬁrst focus on (the lower
index F P F describes the order of the interactions):

( 3.16), but with the supplementary factors due to the Coulomb inter-
action:
the matrix element ( 3.10) and a propagator. The order of all
the elements has to be strictly respected, on view of the presence of dis-
placement and derivation operators. The contributions due to the dif-
ferent orders of interaction (F F P and P F F ) are evaluated from similar
expressions. We can proceed exactly as for the second order contribu-

the begin of its elaboration, that a propagator corresponding to a corre-
lation state has to be treated with an iǫ. A second diﬀerence is the con-

that the matrix elements associated with the Coulomb interaction and the
ﬁeld interaction do not commute. The terms corresponding to that case are
aﬀected by a lower index II, the other by an index I. Straightforward but
very lenghty computations lead to the following expression (as expected, the
P F F order of interaction has provided a vanishing result)

The order of integration respects the ordering of the apparition of the ver-
tices: in all remaining contributions, the integration over the ﬁeld modes k[1]
has to be performed after the integration over the wave number l exchanged
by the coulombian interaction. An opposite order of integration would have
been required in the contribution involving the order P F F of the vertices.

since its action on v(j)
s would provide a vanishing result. The property can
be checked explicitly. Taking into account the value of the matrix tensor gst
r,s , can be seen to involve
=
the scalar product of the vectors e(α)[1] and k[1] that vanishes by deﬁnition of
the polarisation vector. The second contribution, with the product p(j)
u p(j)
v ,
vanishes by symmetry. This result is not unexpected and reﬂects that the
magnetic force is orthogonal to the velocity vector.

This form ( 5.2) shows clearly that the norm is not aﬀected by that

∂
contribution to the equations of motion. Indeed, the partial derivative
∂p(j)
r
ensures that the whole contribution vanishes when integrated over p(j)
r . We
have the same structure that for the contribution (7.15) of [1] or for the

Since the ﬁrst propagator cannot be resonnant, the iǫ can be dropped
from it. We consider anew the case in which the two particles j and j′ are
perfectly localised with a well deﬁned momentum ( 4.7). If we perform the

This new expression is the equivalent of ( 4.9) in presence of the Coulomb
interaction. It determines the ﬁeld due to the accelerated particles in terms
of the actual values of the position qj and momentums pj of the charged
particles. Usually, expressions of the acceleration ﬁelds are given in terms
of the retardated positions. We look for the comparison only for the radia-
tive force, since we have illustrated in
4 the equivalence of the formalisms

Using ( 3.14) that expression can be identiﬁed with the result obtained from

7 Conclusions

Our present work have illustrated the feasability of a goal which seemed out
of reach for physicists, namely a formulation of classical electrodynamics,

41

including the corrections due to the self-ﬁelds, that is free of inconsistencies,
such as an inﬁnite mass correction for charged point particles, or the exis-
tence of runaway solutions. Two distinct ingredients are required. The ﬁrst
one is a relativistic statistical description of interacting ﬁelds and charged
particles in which no unobservable potential appears as dynamical variables.
Balescu-Poulain have developed further the ideas of Bialynicki-Birula [18],
[19] and his coworkers to provide such a formalism free from dynamical
constraints. The elimination of the Lorentz condition is a key element of
the present work that avoids the usual derivation of the self-forces via the
Li´enard-Wiechert potentials. The second ingredient is the possibility, that
we have developed in collaboration with C. George, of getting rid of the
self-ﬁeld by deﬁning an appropriate subdynamics. When both elements are
combined, we obtain a ﬁnite kinetics for the description of the interacting
charges and ﬁelds in which no explicit self-energy process is allowed: the
kinetic operator takes into account all the eﬀects and its computation, al-
thought lenghty, is straightforward.

Many problems can be aborded within the present formalism, such as
the charge renormalization, for instance, of higher order eﬀects. Moreover,
we have considered the charged particles outside an external inﬂuence: the
distribution function corresponding to the vacuum of ﬁeld has been used
thoroughly in this paper. The eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld has not been
speciﬁcally considered: when computing the power dissipated in the motion,
its eﬀect disappears. We have not taken advantage of the statistical nature
of the formalism: a sharp distribution function has been assumed for the
positions and velocities of the particles. A statistical nature for the ﬁeld has
also been ignored.

An irreversible extension of CED, analogous to the treatment of the Lee
model in quantal case, requires the construction of the generators of the Lie
associated with the extended dynamics. The relevance of such an extension
is still to be established.

The absence of divergences in the present classical electrodynamics could
be a good indicator of the corresponding property in the quantal case for
which a similar formulation, without constraint, has been proposed [17].
Since the single subdynamics approach has been devised ﬁrst in a quantal
case, the corresponding kinetic operator can be computed a priori. We hope
to illustrate that property soon.

8 Appendix A

In this part, we consider only one particle interacting with a free transverse
wave. The particle will be pointlike, with a speciﬁc value for the velocity.

˜Θ
From the expression ( 3.13) for < 11[0]
|

11[1(f )] >(0,1), we deduce the

change to the one particle distribution function due to that contribution,
assuming the independence of the ﬁeld and particle variables.

We evaluate ﬁrst in this section the power dissipated by the radiative force
< F(j).vj >I ( 5.9). The second contribution is treated afterwards.

We decompose the vector k[1] into its component k[1]

k and perpendicular
k[1]
⊥ to the velocity vector vj. The scalar product (l.k[1]) becomes the sum
(l.k[1]
⊥ ). By symmetry, the last term will generate a vanishing contri-
bution when integrated over k[1]

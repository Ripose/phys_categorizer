Abstract

We examine the kinetics of a snowball that is gaining mass while is
rolling downhill. This dynamical system combines rotational eﬀects with
eﬀects involving the variation of mass. In order to understand the con-
sequences of both eﬀects we compare its behavior with the one of some
objects in which such eﬀects are absent, so we compare the snowball with
a ball with no mass variation and with a skier with no mass variation nor
rotational eﬀects. Environmental conditions are also included. We con-
clude that the comparative velocity of the snowball respect to the other
objects is particularly sensitive to the hill proﬁle and also depend on some
retardation factors such as the friction, the drag force, the rotation, and
the increment of mass (inertia). We emphasize that the increase of inertia
could surprisingly diminish the retardation eﬀect owing to the drag force.
Additionally, when an exponential trajectory is assumed, the maximum
velocity for the snowball can be reached at an intermediate step of the
trip.

1 Introduction

The snowball is a dynamical object that gains mass while is rolling downhill. It
is a particularly interesting problem since it permits to combine several concepts
of mechanics such as the traslational and rotational dynamics, the rigid body,
mass variable systems, normal and tangential forces, radius of curvature for a
trajectory etc [1, 2]. Modeling this problem implies many input parameters and
the use of numerical methods. Additionally, an ansatz should be made about
the way in which the mass (or volume) is growing with time. Environmental

conditions are also considered utilizing well known assumptions about friction
and drag forces. The dynamical behavior of the snowball will be studied in the
velocity vs time, and velocity vs length −planes.

Moreover, comparison with other dynamical objects could clarify many as-
pects of the very complex behavior of the snowball. Therefore, we will develop
our analysis by comparing the snowball (SB) motion with the one obtained
from a skier sliding without friction (SNF), a skier sliding with friction (SF)
and a ball with constant mass and volume (B).

In section 2, we discuss the basic assumptions and write out the equations of
motion for the snowball. In section 3, the comparison between the four dynam-
ical objects mentioned above is performed in the asymptotic regime. Section
4 describes some proves of consistency to test our results. Section 5 provides
a complete analysis of the comparative kinetics of the four dynamical objects
based on some environmental retardation factors. Section 6 is regarded for the
conclusions.

2 The problem of the snowball rolling downhill

2.1 Basic assumptions

The complete analysis of a snowball requires many input parameters. The
problem does not have any analytical solution, so it has to be solved numerically.
We have listed the numerical values assumed in this paper in table 1 on page
8. Besides, we make the following assumptions in order to get an equation of
motion

1. The snowball is always spherical meanwhile is growing and acquiring mass.

Its density is constant as well.

2. It is supposed that there is only one point of contact between the snowball
and the ground, and that the snowball rolls without slipping throughout
the whole motion. We shall call it the No Slipping Condition (NSC).

3. In order to accomplish the previous condition, the frictional static force
that produces the rotation of the snowball (FRS ), has to hold the condition
FRS ≤ µsN where N is the normal (contact) force to the surface, and µs is
the coeﬃcient of static friction. We assume that µs is independent on the
load (Amontons’ law), this statement applies for not very large loads [4].

4. The drag force owing to the wind is assumed to be of the form

Fv = −

ρACdA
2

v2

(1)

where ρA is the air density, Cd is the air drag coeﬃcient, and A is the
snowball’s projected frontal area i.e. A = πr2.
We assume the air drag coeﬃcient Cd to be constant, since this assumption
has given reasonable results in similar problems [3]. On the other hand,

The kinetics of the snowball

(2)

it has been established that the force Fv could be a linear or quadratic
function of the speed depending on the Reynolds number (Re) [5]. For
Re > 1 (which is our case) a quadratic dependence ﬁts well with experi-
mental issues[6].

5. The mass of the snowball increases but ﬁnally reaches an asymptotic value.
Furthermore, a speciﬁc function of the mass (or volume) in terms of time
must be supposed. In our case we assume the following functional form

M (t) = M0 + K0

−βt

1 − e
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

where M0 is the initial mass of the snowball and clearly the ﬁnal mass is
M0 + K0.

6. A hill proﬁle must be chosen in order to make the simulation, like in other
similar problems [3], it has an important eﬀect on exit speed. Speciﬁcally,
we have chosen an inclined plane and an exponential trajectory.

Figure 1: A snowball rolling downward on a wedge, the X−axis is parallel to
the wedge surface and the Y −axis is perpendicular.

To simplify the problem we start assuming the snowball rolling downhill
on a wedge whose angle is θ (see Fig. 1).
In the time t the snowball has a
mass M and in the time t + dt its mass is M + dM , let us consider a system
consisting of the original snowball of mass M plus the little piece of snow with

4

R. A. Diaz, D. L. Gonzalez, F. Marin, and R. Martinez

mass dM . At the time t, the momentum of such system is P (t) = M v (bold
letters represent vectors) since the little piece of snow is still on the ground and
at rest. At the time t + dt the ball has absorbed the piece of snow completely, so
the momentum is given by P (t + dt) = (M + dM ) (v+dv) then the momentum
change is dP = M dv + vdM (where we have neglected the diﬀerential of second
order) and the total force will be

F =

= M

+ v

dv

where v corresponds to the velocity of the center of mass respect to the ground.
Further, the system is rotating too, we also suppose that such rotation is
always made around an axis which passes through the center of mass (perpen-
dicular to the sheet in Fig. 1). In this case the rotation is around a principal
axis, hence the equation of motion for the angular momentum is given by

where the subscript C refers to the center of mass coordinates. IC denotes the
moment of inertia of the snowball measured from an axis passing through the
−→
center of mass, and
ω C refers to the angular velocity. According to ﬁgure 1,
LC is directed inside the sheet, and the torque will be

We should remember that this equation is valid even if the center of mass is
not an inertial frame [1], which is clearly our case. To calculate dLC we make an
analogous procedure as in the case of dP, and the equation (5) is transformed
into

of simplicity, we will omit the subscript C from now on.

On the other hand, the external forces and torques exerted on the system

are similar to the ones in the simple problem of a ball on a wedge [1]

F = W + N + FRs + Fa;

−→
τ = r × FRs

where W is the weight (which acts as the driving force), N the normal force,
FRs the statical friction force, and Fa is any applied force which does not
produce torque. If we use as a coordinate system the one indicated in ﬁgure 1
(with the Z − axis perpendicular to the sheet) we can convert these equations
into scalar ones; then using Eqs. (3), (6) and (7) we get by supposing that Fa is
parallel to the X − axis.

The ﬁrst equation decouples from the others whenever the NSC is maintained;
so we will forget it by now. We should be careful in utilizing the NSC since the
radius is not constant. The correct NSC in this case consists of the relation
ds = r (dφ) where ds is the diﬀerential length traveled by the center of mass of
the snowball (in a certain diﬀerential time interval dt), dφ is the angle swept
along the diﬀerential path, and r is the snowball radius in the time interval
[t, t + dt]. Using the correct NSC, we get

and taking into account that the radius depends explicitly on the time, we obtain

where ω is the angular velocity, α is the angular acceleration, and v, a are the
traslational velocity and acceleration respectively1.

It is convenient to write everything in terms of the displacement s, taking

the applied force Fa to be the drag force in Eq. (1). With all these ingredients

Finally, to complete the implementation of Eqs. (15), we should propose an
speciﬁc behavior for r (t) or M (t) ; we shall assume that M (t) behaves like in
Eq. (2). On the other hand, as a proof of consistency for Eqs. (15), we see that
if we take r = constant, and Cd = 0, we ﬁnd that

We see that for a suﬃciently large value of x we get θ → 0.

In this case the acceleration written above converts into the tangential one,

where R is the radius of curvature. In order to solve Eq. (17), it is convenient to
use the coordinate axis plotted in ﬁgure 2. In cartesian coordinates, the radius
of curvature is given by

1 + (y′)
y′′
Moreover, the angle θ is not constant any more, and according to the ﬁgure 2
we see that

where the minus sign in the diﬀerential dy is due to the decrease of the coordinate

So the problem of the snowball rolling on an arbitrary trajectory can be
solved by replacing (19) into the ﬁrst of Eqs. (15), and making an assumption
like (2). Additionally, Eq.(17) provides the solutions for the normal force by
considering Eqs. (18), (19) and the solution for the velocity obtained from (15).
Notwithstanding, the ﬁrst of Eqs. (15) does not depend on the normal force
whenever the NSC is maintained. So, we shall ignore it henceforth.

3 Comparison of the snowball with other dy-

namical objects

May be the clearest way to understand the dynamical behavior of the snowball,
is by comparing it with the dynamics of other simpler objects. In our case we
shall compare the dynamics of four dynamical objects

1. A skier sliding with no friction (SNF).

2. The same skier but sliding with friction (SF).

3. A ball with constant mass and volume (B)

4. A snowball with variable mass and volume (SB)

Such comparison will be performed in the v − t and v − x planes. The
behavior of the ﬁrst two objects were reproduced from the article by Catalfamo
[3], and the equations for the ball were obtained from the ones of the snowball
by setting r → constant. In making the comparison we use the input parameters

initial mass of all objects, K0 deﬁnes the increment of mass for the SB see eq.(2),
ρ and ρA are the snow and air densities respectively, µs the statical coeﬃcient
of friction between the B and the ground (and also between the SB and the
ground). Cd is the air drag coeﬃcient, θ the angle of the wedge, AS is the skier

SB see Eq. (2). g is the gravity acceleration, µD is the dynamical coeﬃcient
of friction between the SF and the ground, and v0 is the initial velocity of the
four objects. Further, in the exponential trajectory y = he−αx, where h is the
height of the hill.

of table 1, most of the parameters in this table were extracted from [3]2. As it
can be seen, we assume the same mass M0 for the skier and the ball, and this
is also the initial mass of the snowball ending with a mass of 2M0.

3.1 Asymptotic limits

Before solving all these problems, we shall study the asymptotic limits of the four
objects in the inclined plane and the exponential trajectory with and without
drag force. The asymptotic regime provides useful information and can be used
to analyze the consistency of the numerical solutions. These limits depend on
the drag force, the trajectory and the object itself.

3.1.1 Inclined plane with no drag force

For each object we obtain the following limits

• For the SF its velocity is easily found

v = v0 + gt (sin θ − µD cos θ)

(20)

so there is no ﬁnite value for the velocity and its behavior is linear respect
to time. The SNF asymptotic limit is obtained just taking µD → 0.

• For the SB from Eq.(15) and assuming that the radius reaches an asymp-

totic limit i.e. dr/dt → 0 when t → ∞ we get

v (t → ∞) ≡ v∞ = v0 +

gt sin θ

(21)

2However, we have changed mildly the parameters that describe the proﬁle of the expo-

nential trajectory, in order to keep the NSC throughout.

The kinetics of the snowball

getting a linear behavior respect to time. The same behavior is exhibited
by the B when t → ∞.

Observe that v∞ in the SB is independent on the mass and equal to the
value for the ball B, it is reasonable owing to the asymptotic behavior
assumed for the SB, Eq. (2).

• For the SF its equation of motion is easily obtained

where r∞ ≡ r (t → ∞) . The second term in (23) is obtained from Eq.(2) by

(cid:21)

In the case of the B, we obtain the expression (23) but r∞, M∞, A∞ are
constant in time and equal to its initial values r0, M0, A0.

3.1.3 Exponential trajectory with no drag force

In this case it is easier to examine the asymptotic limits, since when the objects
have traveled a long path, θ → 0 and the object is reduced to run over a
horizontal plane, see ﬁgure 2. Therefore the limits are

• For the SF, v∞ = 0.

• For the SNF, it is found easily by energy conservation

where h is the height of the hill.

10

R. A. Diaz, D. L. Gonzalez, F. Marin, and R. Martinez

• For the B we can ﬁnd v∞ by taking into account that energy is conserved
because friction does not dissipate energy when the NSC is held [1]. By
using energy conservation we obtain3

v2
∞ =

7

gh

For the snowball the limit is not easy to obtain because energy is not con-
served and Eq. (15) does not provide any useful information4. However,
according to the ﬁgures 5, this limit is lower than the one of the B owing
to the increment of inertia.

3.1.4 Exponential trajectory with drag force

In this case all velocities vanish for suﬃciently long time.

4 Proves of consistency

The equations of motion for each object where solved by a fourth order Runge
Kutta integrator[7]. To verify the correct implementation of the program, we
reproduce the results obtained by [3], and solve analitically the problem of the
ball of constant radius in the inclined plane without drag force, the results were
compared with the numerical solution. Additionally, all the asymptotic values
discussed above were obtained consistently.

Finally, the reader could have noticed that one of our main assumptions
was the NSC. However, this condition can only be valid if we ensure that the
statical friction force does not exceed the value µsN all over the trajectory in
each case. Otherwise, the snowball would start slipping preventing us of using
the fundamental relations (9) and (10). Additionally, if the snowball started
sliding, the frictional force would become dynamics i.e. FRD = µDN producing
a coupling among the three Eqs. (8), remember that we have assumed that the
ﬁrst one was decoupled. As a ﬁrst approach, we study the validity of the NSC
in the asymptotic regime by calculating FRS (t → ∞) and µsN (t → ∞).

For the inclined plane, these limits can be estimated by using Eq. (2), the

ﬁrst of Eqs. (8), and the second of Eqs. (15)

µsN (t → ∞) → µsM∞g cos θ

dt2 (cid:19)∞

FRS (t → ∞) →

(cid:18)

.

(24)

it is easy to verify that the NSC is valid in the asymptotic limit for the wedge,
since in the case of the presence of a drag force we get FRS (t → ∞) = 0. Addi-
tionally, in the case of absence of the drag force it is found that FRs (t → ∞) =
3Since what really matters for energy conservation is the height of the center of mass, there
is a tiny diﬀerence that can be neglected if the radius of the ball is much smaller that the
height of the hill.

4By using θ → 0, and d2s/dt2 → 0, the second of Eqs. (15) becomes trivial.

The kinetics of the snowball

11

(2/7) (M0 + K0) g sin θ, and the condition FRS (t → ∞) ≤ µsN (t → ∞) is ac-
complished by our input parameters (see table 1).

For the exponential trajectory the analysis is even simpler, since the path for
large times becomes a horizontal straight line, the asymptotic limits for FRS and
µsN are the same as in Eqs. (24) but with θ → 0; and the NSC condition is
held when t → ∞.

However, the NSC in the asymptotic regime does not guarantee that it is
held throughout the path. For example, in the case of the exponential trajectory,
the maximum slope of the proﬁle is found at the beginning of the trajectory, it
was because of this fact that we changed mildly the proﬁle parameters deﬁned
in Ref. [3]. Consequently, by using the ﬁrst of Eqs. (8) as well as the Eqs. (15),
(17), (18), and (19); we solved numerically for FRS vs time and length and for
µsN vs time and length; utilizing the numerical input values of table 1. We then
checked that FRS ≤ µsN throughout the time or length interval considered in
each case.

5 Analysis

In order to make a clear comparison, we take the initial mass of all the objects
to be equal, and all initial velocities are zero. In ﬁgures 3-6 we use the following
conventions: The dashed dotted line corresponds to the SNF, the solid line
represents the SF, the dashed line refers to the B, and ﬁnally the dotted line
corresponds to the SB. In both, ball and snowball we only consider statical
friction and neglect possible dynamic frictional eﬀects due to sliding, because we
have guaranteed that the NSC is valid throughout the trajectory, as explained
in section 4.

In ﬁgure 3 we plot v vs t and v vs x for constant slope of the wedge
without drag force. Of course, all graphics in the v − t plane are straigth lines
except the one for the snowball. We can see that the SNF is the fastest object
as expected, since no retardation factors are acting on it, next we have the B
which posseses the rotation as a retardation factor. Additionally, the SB line
is always below the B line because in the former, two retardation factors are
present: the rotation and the increase of inertia. However, for suﬃciently long
time (or length) the increase of inertia vanishes (according to our assumptions)
so that the velocities of both B and SB coincide, in agreement with the analysis
made in Sec. 3.1.1. We checked that condition, though it does not appear in
the Fig. 3, because of the short time and length interval displayed.

The line corresponding to the SF is below the line corresponding to the
SNF as it must be, however the relation between the SF and SB lines is
particularly interesting and deserves more attention. At the beginning the SB
is slightly slower than the SF, but for suﬃciently long time, the SB becomes
faster. It can be explained in the following way, at the beginning the SB has
two retardation factors: the rotation and the increase of inertia, while the SF

12

Figure 3: Plots in the v − t plane (left) and the v − x plane (right) when the
objects travel in a wedge of constant slope with no drag force.

only has one retardation factor: the sliding friction. On the other hand, for
suﬃciently long time the increment of inertia becomes negligible in the SB, and
only the rotation acts as a retardation factor, consequently the SB behaves like
the B as shown in section 3. Therefore, the combination of the two retardation
factors at the beginning makes the SB slower but when the increase of inertia
is small enough, the SB becomes faster than the SF. Nevertheless, we should
point out that this behavior depend on the value of µD, if it were large enough
the line for the SF would lie below the lines for B and SB at all times, in
contrast if it were small enough the SF line would lie above the B and SB lines.
Notwithstanding, the rapidity of the SF must be smaller than the SNF speed
at any time and for any value of µD.

According to this analysis, when the objects travel in a wedge with no drag
force, the pattern of velocities in descendent order for any set of the input
parameters (as long as the initial masses and velocities are the same) is the
following: the SNF, the B and the SB. The comparative velocity of the SF
depend on the input parameters but it must be always slower than the SNF.
As a proof of consistency, it can be checked that the asymptotic limits in Eqs.
(20), (21) obey this pattern.

13

Figure 4: Plots in the v − t plane (left) and the v − x plane (right) when the
objects run over a wedge of constant slope with drag force.

Figure 4 correspond to a wedge with constant slope including drag force.
In this case the comparative behavior among the four elements is not as simple
as in ﬁgure 3, because in this case the lines cross out each other. However, the
line describing the SF is always below the line describing the SNF as it should
be. This more complex behaviour owes to the frontal area dependence of the
drag force. For instance, we can realize that at short times the comparative
behavior is very similar to the one in ﬁgure 3, since the drag force has not still
acted signiﬁcantly. All these elements get an asymptotic limit as we described
in section 3. We see that the largest asymptotic limit correspond to the SB,
in opposition to the case of ﬁgure 3 with no drag force, in which the snowball
was one of the slowest objects; the clue to explain this fact recides in the frontal
area dependence of the drag force. From Eqs. (22, 23) we can verify that for
all these objects the terminal velocity behaves as v2 ∝ M/A, this quotient is
larger for the B than for the SNF and the SF in our case, then the asymptotic
velocity vB is larger than vSN F and vSF , for both the skier and the ball this
ratio is a constant. In contrast, since in the snowball the mass grows cubically
with the radius while the area grows quadratically, its velocity behaves such
that v2
∝ r (t) . Therefore, for suﬃciently long times, its velocity grows with
the radius of the SB, getting a higher terminal velocity (of course it depends on

behavior of r (t) in (15) we would have not obtained any ﬁnite terminal velocity
for the snowball even in the presence of a drag force. Furthermore, we see that
the terminal velocity for the SB is reached in a longer time than the others, it
is also because of the slow growth of r(t).

Figure 5 describes the four elements traveling in an exponential hill with
no drag force. Two features deserve special attention: (1) the terminal velocity
is achieved in a very short time specially in the cases of the SNF and the B,
these limits coincides with the ones obtained in section 3. (2) For the SB and
the SF there is a local maximum velocity at a rather short time, the diminution
in the velocity since then on, owes to the decreasing in the slope of the path
in both cases, the increment of inertia in the case of the SB, and the friction
in the SF. Such local maximal velocity cannot be exhibited by the SNF and
the B because conservation of energy applies for them, and as they are always
descending their velocities are always increasing, though for long times they
are practically at the same height henceforth, getting the terminal velocity. In
particular, we see that the terminal velocity of the SF is zero as it was shown
in Sec. 3.1.3.

Figure 6: Plot in the v − t plane (left) and the v − x plane (right) when the
objects run over an exponential trajectory with drag force. All velocities vanish
for suﬃciently long time (or length) as expected, despite it is not shown in the
interval displayed.

In ﬁgure 6 the elements travel in an exponential hill with drag force. In
this case, the conservation of energy does not hold for any of the objects, conse-
quently maximum velocities in intermediate steps of the trajectory are allowed
for all of them. All terminal velocities are zero as expected. Because of the
same arguments discussed above, the line of the SF is below to the one of the
SNF. However, any other pattern depend on the numerical factors utilized.

A ﬁnal comment is in order, we can realize that though the solution of the
kinetics of the snowball depends on the ansatz made about the mass growth,
the bulk of our results and analysis only depend on the fact that the snowball
mass reaches a ﬁnite asymptotic value. So that the discussion is quite general,
especially in the asymptotic regime.

6 Conclusions

We have described the behavior of a snowball acquiring mass while rolling down-
hill, taking into account the enviromental conditions. The dynamics of the
snowball is very complex because it is a rotating object and at the same time

its mass and moment of inertia are variables. In order to visualize better the
eﬀects due to the rotation and mass variation, we compare its motion with the
kinetics of two objects in which the rotation and mass variational eﬀects are
absent (the Skier with Friction and the Skier with No Friction), and with one
object in which the rotation is present but no the mass variation (the Ball of
constant mass and radius).

The comparative behavior of these objects depend on the trajectory but
also on some retardation factors: the friction, the drag force, the increase of
mass (inertia), and the rotational eﬀects. It worths to remark that despite the
increment of inertia is a retardation factor in some circumstances, it could sur-
prisingly diminish the retardation eﬀect due to the drag force. In addition, some
local maxima of the velocities for each object appears in an exponential trajec-
tory, showing that the maximum velocity might be achieved at an intermediate
step of the path.

Finally, we point out that despite the complete solution of the snowball de-
pends on an ansatz about the way in which its mass grows; its comparative
dynamics respect to the other objects in the asymptotic regime is basically in-
dependent of the details of the growth, and only depend on the assumption that
the mass reaches an asymptotic value, a very reasonable supposition. Therefore,
we consider that our analysis is not very model dependent at least in the regime
of large times or lengths.
In addition, these asymptotic limits serves also to
show the consistency of our results.

Abstract
This paper shows the uniﬁed descriptions of the general, Hamilton, Voss,
H¨older, Maupertuis-Lagrange variational principles of integral style, and ﬁnds the
intrinsic relations among the diﬀerent integral variational principles, it is proved
that, under the condition of Eq.(7), f0= 0 is just the result satisfying the quan-
titative causal principle, the intrinsic relations among the invariant quantities
and among the Noether conservation charges of the all integral and diﬀerential
variational principles are found.

Physical laws may be expressed by variational principle not only by diﬀerential
formulas, in fact, diﬀerential formulas can be derived from variational principle,
and there are the variational principles of diﬀerential and integral styles[1, 2].
The uniﬁed descriptions of the all diﬀerential variational principles are presented
in Ref.[3].

Ref.[3] rigorously gives the expression of the quantitative causal principle in

terms of the no-loss-no-gain principle in the Universe[4]

DA − CA = 0

in which A is a action, C identity and D group operator of inﬁnitesimal continuous
transformations. Real physical process should be that the whole system with
group D symmetry satisﬁes the quantitative causal principle with the no-loss-no-
gain character, that is, the action A takes limit value under the transformation
of group D

Since Eq.(4) is a limit process, not losing generality, neglecting two-order

where εσ ( σ = 1, 2, · · · , m) are linearly independent inﬁnitesimal parameters of

Substituting Eq.(7) into Eq.(6), neglecting two order inﬁnitesimal quantity,

then Eq.(6) is simpliﬁed as

In the past, f0 = 0 is well known widely to be the result keeping Euler-
Lagrange Equation invariant, now it is seen that under the condition of Eq.(7),
f0 = 0 is not the result that maintains Euler-Lagrange equation invariant, which
is just the result satisfying the quantitative causal principle. This is the new
result that has not been obtained in the past.

Using Eq.(9) may give the uniﬁed descriptions and the intrinsic relations of

all variational principles of integral style.

In terms of the requirement that integrating the second term in Eq.(9) van-
ishes, it follows that the conditions of the general variational principle are: for
the ﬁxed t1 and t2, δqi|t=t1 = δqi|t=t2 = 0 , △t|t=t1 = △t|t=t2 = 0 and g(t1) =
g(t2), and using arbitration of δqi, we obtain Euler-Lagrange Equation

Using the requirement that integrating the ﬁrst term in Eq.(11) is zero, it
follows that the conditions of Hamilton variational principle are: for the ﬁxed t1
and t2, δqi|t=t1 = δqi|t=t2 = 0 and g(t1) = g(t2), and looking from Eq space, which
is ﬁxed endpoint variational. Using arbitration of δqi,we get Euler-Lagrange
Equation (10).
Due to

△q(r)

i = δq(r)

(13)

Because the requirement that integrating the second term in Eq.(13) vanishes,
we obtain that the conditions of Voss variational principle are: unequal time
variational, △t|t=t1 = △t|t=t2 = 0, △pqi|t=t1 = △pqi|t=t2 = 0 and g(t1) = g(t2).
.
Because △pqi−
qi △t (i = 1, 2, · · · , n.) construct virtual variational of the system,
we similarly get the Euler-Lagrange Equation (10) from Eq.(13).

Using the demand that keeps Eq.(16)’s right hand side no-loss-no-gain to
equate zero, we obtain that the conditions of H¨older variational principle are: un-
equal time variational, △t may be not to equate to zero and △qi|t=t1 = △qi|t=t2 =
0.

When the system satisﬁes the Euler-Lagrange Eq.(10), we get the simpliﬁed

expression of Eq.(16) of H¨older variational principle as follows

It is seen that H¨older variational principle is originated from Eq.(9) satisfying
the quantitative causal principle yet, looking in Eq space, the variational is the
variational of variant endpoint along time t axis.

When taking equal time variational in Eq.(17), it is simpliﬁed as Hamilton

variational principle[6]

It is looked that Hamilton variational principle not containing g is yet a sim-

Eq.(21) is just expression of Maupertuis-Lagrange variational principle. It is
watched that the Maupertuis-Lagrange principle’s conditions is H¨older’s, i.e, the
endpoints are motional[2].

It is seen from the studies of this part that the uniﬁed descriptions of the
all variational principles of integral style are shown by means of the quantita-
tive causal principle, and the other high order principles etc can be analogously
discussed.

Now we discuss their conservation quantities about the above principles.

Taking endpoint condition (· · ·)(t1) = (· · ·)(t2) in Eq.(9), when using arbitra-
tions of t1, t2 and t in given [t01,t02] and δqi, we obtain Euler-Lagrange Eq.(10)
and the following general conservation quantity of the general variational princi-
ple

δqi + L△t + g = const

(22)

Analogous to the discussions of Eq.(22), the conservation quantity of the Voss
variational principle may be obtained. On the other hand, because Eq.(22) is the
general conservation quantity, the conservation quantity of the Voss variational
.
principle can also be achieved by substituting δqi = △pqi−
qi △t into the general
conservation expression (22) as follows

(△pqi−

.
qi △t) + L△t + g = const

(23)

The general integral conservation quantity Eq.(22) is compared with the dif-

ferential conservation quantity[3]

δqi + L△t = const, σ = 1, 2, · · · , m

(24)

g is the more part than the diﬀerential style’s.

When taking equal time variational in the general conservation expression

(22), we obtain conservation quantity of Hamilton variational principle

In the similar reason, it follows from Eq.(16) that the conservation quantity

Since the expression (21) of Maupertuis-Lagrange variational principle is just
the result of H¨older variational principle under the constraint conditions (19) and
∂L/∂t = 0, thus the corresponding conservation quantity is still Eq.(26).

Substituting L = 2T −const. into Eq.(26) we further deduces the conservation

quantity of Maupertuis-Lagrange variational principle as follows

Now we use the conservation quantities above to ﬁnd the corresponding Noether
conservation charges of the systems with invariant properties of Lie group Dm.

in which εσ (σ = 1, 2, · · · , m) are inﬁnitesimal parameters corresponding to ασ.
Using Eqs.(7), (12), (22), (28-31) and εσ’s arbitration, we obtain the Noether

conservation charges of the Voss variational principles is still Eq.(23) but substi-
tuting (ξσ

Applying Eqs.(12), (24), (28-31) and εσ’s arbitration or in the general Eq.(32)
let gσ = 0, we get the Noether conservation charges of the all diﬀerential varia-
tional principles[3].

Using Eqs.(7), (12), (25), (28-31) and εσ’s arbitration or in the general Eq.(32)
let ∆t = τ σ = 0, we obtain the Noether conservation charges of the Hamilton

(35)

we thus get the conclusion that the Noether conservation charges of the general
variational principles are general, the Noether conservation charges of the other
variational principles are the special example of the general variational principle’s
under diﬀerent conditions.

It can be seen from the studies above that all variational principles of integral
style deduce the same Euler-Lagrange Eq.(10), and there may be the diﬀerent
conservation quantities of the diﬀerent systems, The former characterizes that
physical laws don’t depend on diﬀerent conditions, the latter characterizes that
physical manifestations of systems may be many kinds of variations, because the
invariant quantities are relative to the physical observable quantities. Since the
quantitative causal principle is more general, its uses to high order Lagrange and
ﬁeld theory will be written in the other papers.

In summary, this paper, in terms of the mathematical expression of quantita-
tive causal principle with no-loss-no-gain character, shows the uniﬁed descriptions
of the new general, Hamilton, Voss, H¨older, Maupertuis-Lagrange variational
principles of integral style, ﬁnds the intrinsic relations among the diﬀerent inte-
gral variational principles, it is shown that under the condition of Eq.(7), f0 = 0
is not the result that maintains Euler-Lagrange equation invariant, which is just
the result satisfying the quantitative causal principle, this is new result that has
not been obtained in the past, and ﬁnds the intrinsic relations among the invari-
ant quantities of the all integral and diﬀerential variational principles, and the
intrinsic relations among the Noether conservation charges of the all integral and
diﬀerential variational principles are found. In fact, the discussions above and
Ref.[3] make the expressions of the past scrappy numerous variational principles
be uniﬁed into the relative consistent system of the all variational principles in
terms of the quantitative causal principle, which is essential for researching the
intrinsic relations among the past scrappy numerous variational principles and
physical laws and further making their logic simpliﬁcation and clearness.

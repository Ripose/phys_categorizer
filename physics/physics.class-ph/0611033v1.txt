Abstract

An uniformly accelerated observer can build his proper system of coordinates in a delimited

sector of the ﬂat Minkowski spacetime. The properties of the position and time coordinate lines

for such an observer are studied and compared with the coordinate lines for an inertial observer in

a Penrose diagram for this spacetime.

INTRODUCTION

It is sometimes useful to dispose of a graphical representation of the totality of the

spacetime, for instance to study asymptotic forms of various ﬁelds (metric, curvature tensor,

electromagnetic ﬁeld, etc.). A very elegant mathematical technique to study the asymptotic

properties of spacetimes has been developed by Roger Penrose in 1964 and later used by

Brandon Carter [1, 2]. The idea is to perform what is called a conformal transformation of

spacetime to bring inﬁnities at ﬁnite distances while preserving its causal structure (light

cones are unaltered). Asymptotic calculations are then converted into calculations at ﬁnite

points with a set of new coordinates, the conformal coordinates, which attribute ﬁnite values

to inﬁnities. The diagram of the spacetime after transformation is called a Penrose diagram

or, less frequently, a Penrose-Carter diagram.

A better understanding of the structure of a spacetime can be obtained by the knowledge

of its coordinate lines with a clear physical meaning. For the ﬂat Minkowski spacetime, a

natural choice is to take lines with constant time or position. These coordinate lines are

straight lines cutting each other at right angle in an ordinary diagram while, in a Penrose

diagram, the equations of these lines are complicated functions of the conformal coordinates.

These are studied in section II.

The motion of an observer with a constant proper acceleration can be treated analytically.

It is a classical exercise of special relativity that can be found in many textbooks [3, 4,

5, 6].

In this framework, the very prominent notion of event horizon can be introduced

in a simple context. An uniformly accelerated observer can build his proper system of

coordinates in a delimited, but inﬁnite, sector of the ﬂat Minkowski spacetime [7, 8, 9,

10]. The corresponding time and position coordinate lines are respectively hyperbolas and

straight lines in an ordinary diagram. A detailed study of the equations of these lines with

conformal coordinates is performed in section III.

A brief summary of our results about these mappings of the ﬂat Minkowski spacetime for

both an inertial observer and an uniformly accelerated observer is given in section IV. Let

us note that all results are obtained for 1 + 1 Minkowski spacetime.

II. THE MINKOWSKI SPACETIME

A. Change of coordinates

The change of coordinates to bring back inﬁnities at ﬁnite distances is

with

π/2 < ψ

ξ < π/2. L is an arbitrary length, and ψ and ξ are dimensionless

−

±
quantities, the conformal coordinates.

It is useful to deﬁne new dimensionless spacetime

variables: T = ct/L and X = x/L which will be used throughout the text. Equations (1)

are then reduced to

ct + x = L tan(ψ + ξ),

ct

x = L tan(ψ

ξ),

−

−

T + X = tan(ψ + ξ),

T

X = tan(ψ

ξ).

−

−

With these conformal coordinates, the totality of the spacetime is represented by a square

(see ﬁgure 1), sometimes called the Minkowski diamond. As we will see below, coordinate

lines with constant position and time converge at the apexes of the square. These points

are the conformal inﬁnities for space and time.

The equation of motion of a photon passing by the position X∗ at time T∗ is X

T =

X∗

T∗. In the conformal coordinates, it is written

±

ξ

ψ = arctan(X∗

T∗).

±

±

So, as in an ordinary diagram, the world line of a photon in the Penrose diagram is still a
line slanted at an angle of 45◦, but with respect to the ξ and ψ coordinates. The causal

structure in the Penrose diagram is given by light cones for variables ξ and ψ, as it is given

by light cones for variables X and T in an ordinary diagram. The diagonal boundaries of

the Penrose diagram are the inﬁnities where world line of light rays must end.

With the new coordinates, the metric ds2 = c2dt2

III. THE UNIFORMLY ACCELERATED OBSERVER

A. Hyperbolic motion

Let us consider an uniformly accelerated observer with a constant proper acceleration

with magnitude A > 0. Its motion is such that it reaches the point x = 0 in the inertial

frame at time t = 0 with a vanishing speed. The world line of the observer is given by

[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

−
which is the equation of a branch of hyperbola in spacetime. So this motion is also called

The asymptotes of this curve are the two straight lines with equations T =

(X + 1).

Consequently, the asymptotes of the world line of the accelerated observer deﬁnes two event

horizons [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In the conformal coordinates, equations of these horizons

are

ψ =

(ξ + π/4).

±

(13)

These two horizons cross at event H with spacetime coordinates (ξH, ψH ) = (0,

π/4) cor-

responding to (X, T ) = (

1, 0). The past (future) horizon intercepts the positive past

−

(future) light inﬁnity at event S (E) with spacetime coordinates (ξS, ψS) = (π/8,

3π/8)

((ξE, ψE) = (π/8, 3π/8)). They cut the whole spacetime in four regions, called Rindler

sectors (see ﬁgure 2). The sector I is the portion of the spacetime in which the uniformly

accelerated observer lives: he can send information to any event and he can receive infor-

mation from any event in this sector. In sector II, located “above” the future horizon, the

observer can send information to any event but cannot receive information from this sector.

The situation is exactly the opposite in the sector IV, located “below” the past horizon.

The sector III is causally completely disconnected from the observer.

One can check that this world line starts at the event S and ends at the event E, both on

positive lightlike inﬁnity, as expected since the speed of this observer is equal to the speed

of light in the inﬁnite past and future.

The uniformly accelerated observer can build his proper system of dimensionless coordi-

nates, spacelike X0 and timelike T0, valid only in sector I [7, 8, 9, 10]. With relations (7)

of [10], for instance, it is possible to determine the equations of the coordinate lines of

this observer proper frame in the inertial frame. In this last frame, the equation of a time

coordinate line with X0 constant is

(X + 1)

T 2 = (X0 + 1)

This curve is a branch of hyperbola whose asymptotes are the two event horizons mentioned

above. These horizons are located on the degenerate asymptotes obtained with X0 =

1 in

equation (16). Obviously, the world line of the uniformly accelerated observer in his proper

frame is given by X0 = 0. Let us note that an object with a constant position X0 is not

at rest with the uniformly accelerated observer. This object is characterized by a proper

uniform acceleration whose magnitude A(X0) is given by [9, 10]

The equation of a position coordinate line with T0 constant is

be seen that the future horizon and the past horizon correspond respectively to the position

coordinate lines T0 = +

light rays end. The “mini-spacetime” of an uniformly accelerated observer is a small diamond

included in the ﬁrst one with one common spacelike inﬁnity. At ﬁrst sight, the coordinate

lines for such an observer seems similar to those for the whole spacetime (compare ﬁgure 1

with ﬁgure 4) but there are big diﬀerences:

inﬁnities of the whole spacetime, while position coordinate lines end on one extremity

All these diﬀerences could be expected from the examination of ﬁgure 3. But, in this paper,

the equations and properties of the coordinate lines for both an inertial observer and an

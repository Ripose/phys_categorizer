Abstract

We present a generic solution to the fundamental problem of how to con-
nect two points in a plane by a smooth curve that goes through these points
with a given slope. The smoothness of any curve depends both on its cur-
vature and its length. The smoothest curves correspond to a particular
compromise between minimal curvature and minimal length. They can be
described by a class of functions that satisfy certain boundary conditions
and minimize a weight functional. The value of this functional is given es-
sentially by the average of the curvature raised to some power ν times the
length of the curve. The parameter ν determines the importance of minimal
curvature with respect to minimal length. In order to ﬁnd the functions that
obtain the minimal weight, we use extensively notions that are well-known
in classical mechanics. The minimization of the weight functional via the
Euler-Lagrange formalism leads to a highly non-trivial diﬀerential equation.
Using the symmetries of the problem it is possible to ﬁnd conserved quanti-
ties, that help to simplify the problem to a level where the solution functions
can be written in a closed form for any given ν. Applying the appropriate
coordinate transformation to these solutions allows to adjust them to all
possible boundary conditions.

I. INTRODUCTION

A. The problem

Consider two points in a plane, each associated with a ray pointing in some direction.
The problem we address in this paper is how to connect these points in a “smooth” way.
That is we are looking for a curve that satisﬁes the following three conditions:

1. The curve goes through both points.

2. The associated ray at each point is a tangent to the curve.

3. Between the two points the curve follows some optimal path, which is a compromise

between minimal curvature and minimal length.

The ﬁrst two requirements constitute the boundary conditions of the problem. The third
condition deﬁnes what we mean by “smooth”.

B. Motivation and Outline

A solution to the problem outlined above has many obvious applications. For example it
could be used to determine the ideal shape of a road to be built between two points where its
direction is predetermined (e.g. by two bridges). In fact any interpolation problem that has
been reduced to the task of connecting a sample of data points where the slope is ﬁxed can
be solved using the elementary solution of connecting smoothly two points. If the original
sample only consists of points, the respective slopes can be determined, for example, by
taking the slope of the line through the neighboring points, or by some diﬀerent, more
sophisticated method. Evidently the quality of interpolation curves is crucial to all ﬁelds
that deal with numerical data from applied sciences to economics. It is interesting to note
that while there exist many interpolation schemes, most of them rely on simple functions,
like polynomials, that in general do not give the best interpolation. The aim of this work
is to establish ﬁrst a criterion for the quality of the interpolation and then to investigate
quantitatively which are the optimal interpolating curves.

As we shall see in the following, the problem outlined above translates into a well-deﬁned
mathematical exercise, which is interesting by itself. In fact we feel that our solution to the
problem, relying heavily on notions well known in physics, has also a pedagogical value.
It serves as an example of some fundamental physics principles in the context of a very
intuitive and visual, yet non-trivial problem.

Since the problem is deﬁned as a geometrical task, its mathematical formulation ob-
viously does not depend on time. Instead we take one space-direction (x) as the variable
of integration, and the other space-direction (y) to describe the solution function. While

2

y
this description is not manifestly invariant under rotations and translations in the x
plane, it allows us to deﬁne an action functional that assigns a weight to any function (that
complies with the boundary conditions) according to its “smoothness”. It is given essen-
tially by the average of the inverse curvature radius, to some power ν, times the length of
the curve. This action is minimized by a class of functions, each describing the smoothest
curve for a particular choice of the parameter ν that speciﬁes the relative importance of
minimal curvature with respect to minimal length. These functions are the solutions of the
Euler-Lagrange equation, which turns out to be a complicated, non-linear third order diﬀer-
ential equation. Solving this equation can be facilitated immensely by taking advantage of
the symmetries of the problem. We compute the linear and angular momenta that follow
from Noether’s theorem due to the translational and rotational invariance. The equation
of motion is also scale invariant, but there exists no conserved charge corresponding to
scaling, since the Lagrangian and other dimensionful variables do change under scaling
transformations. The problem is solved explicitly for a particular choice of the momenta.
Applying the appropriate coordinate transformation to this solution allows to adjust it to
all possible boundary conditions.

II. FORMALISM

In order to translate the problem outlined in Section I A into a mathematical one we
have to introduce some notations: Let us give “names” to the two points: We shall refer
to them as the initial point Pi and the ﬁnal point Pf . Which one is which is arbitrary, but
when introducing coordinates

Pi : (xi, yi)

and

Pf : (xf , yf ) ,

(1)

we demand that xi < xf . The coordinates (x, y) are a set of two real numbers specifying
any point in the plane. We use simple Euclidean geometry. The associated rays at Pi and
Pf are described by their inclination angles, αi and αf , with respect to the vector pointing
from Pi to Pf (c.f. Fig. 1).

We call the function y(x) that satisﬁes the three conditions in Section I A the “smooth
connection function” (SCF). Our task is to determine this function. The boundary condi-
tions deﬁned in Section I A are:

y(xi) = yi
y′(xi) = tan(αi + α0)

and

and

y(xf ) = yf ,
y′(xf ) = tan(αf + α0) ,

(2)

(3)

where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to x and α0 is the angle between the
positive x-axis and the vector pointing from Pi to Pf .

In order to include the third and crucial condition in Section I A we need to incorporate
both the curvature and the length of the curve. The local curvature at a given point on

3

the curve is deﬁned as the inverse radius (1/r) of the circle that coincides with the curve in
the inﬁnitesimal vicinity of the point. It is given in terms of the ﬁrst and second derivative
of the function y(x) by:

1
r(x)

=

y′′(x)
[1 + y′(x)2]3/2 .

|

|

(4)

(5)

(6)

To show this relation it is enough to verify that the curves that describes a circle, i.e.
x0)2 + y0, where r is the radius and (x0, y0) denotes the center of the
y(x) =
circle, give r(x) = r. The length of an inﬁnitesimal piece of the curve at x is given by

We shall refer to ˜
[y(x)] as the action. For a given function y(x) it returns the weighted
S
sum of ds(x) where x goes from xi to xf . The weight at position x is given by the local
curvature 1/r(x), deﬁned in eq. (4), raised to some power ν. A priori this parameter is
an arbitrary real number that determines how to choose the compromise between minimal
curvature and minimal length. For example, for ν = 0 the curvature does not play a role
at all and ˜
the situation is exactly
S
| → ∞
the opposite, since ˜
(1/r)νdx only depends on the curvature in this case. A
S
special situation arises for ν = 1, where ˜
αi. Since the
[y(x)] =
S
action gives just the diﬀerence between the inclination angles at the boundary, independent
of the particular choice of y(x), it is impossible to determine the optimal path for ν = 1
and we exclude this case from our subsequent discussion.

[y(x)]ν=0 is just the length of the curve. For

In order to ﬁnd the optimal curve we have to minimize the action under the boundary
conditions in eq. (2) and eq. (3). Before we continue with our analysis we would like to give
a concrete example illustrating the relevance of the action functional. Consider a spacecraft
that has been launched to explore some distant planets and which is ﬂying with constant
velocity v through the interstellar space. When approaching a certain planet, one has to
adjust carefully the trajectory of the spaceship, say to enter the atmosphere of the planet
at a precise angle or to use its gravitational ﬁeld to accelerate the spacecraft to its next
destination. Suppose that for this purpose the spaceship has thrusters that exert a force
F perpendicular to the direction of motion. Then at any given time t between the ignition
(at ti) and the end of the manoeuvre (at tf ) the instantaneous curvature radius r(t) is
inversely proportional to F . Let us assume that the fuel consumption per unit time,
, is
(1/r)ν, where ν is an empirical parameter.
governed by some potential law, i.e.
∝
dt, is proportional to the action in eq. (6),
Then the total fuel consumption,

W ∝

since dt = ds/v. Obviously minimizing
is crucial. Once we have found the solution for
the trajectory we can obtain the curvature radius as a function of t which indicates how
much fuel should be burned at each point.

y and x enter the action ˜

if they are taken as independent variables. Such a situation is referred to as a “regular
problem” and it implies that the solutions of the EOM indeed give rise to a local minimum
of the action if ν < 0 or ν > 1. Conversely for 0 < ν < 1 one obtains a local maximum.
Thus we rule out any 0 < ν

ν > 1 from now on.

Even though we have managed to translate the problem at hand into a diﬀerential
equation, solving this equation analytically seems like a formidable task given that eq. (17)
is third order in q and non-linear. However, the integrated form in eq. (16) gives us a hint
of how to proceed. The fact that λ is a constant is related to the symmetries inherent
to the problem. Studying these symmetries systematically one can simplify the problem
signiﬁcantly and ﬁnd its solutions.

Let us examine more carefully the problem with respect to its intrinsic symmetries.
The important point to realize is that when introducing the coordinates in eq. (1) we have
made an explicit choice of

how to orientate the axes and

what units of length to use.

•

•

•

These choices are arbitrary and once we have found a solution to our problem we can
redeﬁne our coordinate system. Assume that y(x) solves the EOM in eq. (17) in some
coordinate system Σ and that ˜y(˜x) is obtained from y(x) by a transformation to a diﬀerent
coordinate system ˜Σ ,

describes a rotation by an angle θ, and x0 and y0 parameterize a translation in the x-
direction and in the y-direction, respectively. The action in eq. (6) is deﬁned in terms
the curvature radius r [c.f. eq. (4)] and the length element ds in eq. (5). Both quantities
are manifestly invariant under rotations and translations. Therefore it is clear that the
coordinate transformations in eq. (19) do not change the action nor the EOM derived from
it. However the boundary conditions obviously have to change under Σ

˜Σ.
Let us consider the inﬁnitesimal change of the coordinate y at a given x,

→

for the three types of coordinate transformations. For a translation in the y-direction

δy(x)

˜y(x)

y(x) ,

≡

y0 = ǫy ≪

x0 = 0 ,

θ = 0 ,

the answer is trivial. The change in y is simply

implying that the changes in all the derivatives of y(x) vanish:

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

However, a translation in the x-direction

δy(x, ǫy) = ǫy ,

δq(x, ǫy) = 0 ,
δq′(x, ǫy) = 0 ,
δq′′(x, ǫy) = 0 .

is a bit more tricky. First, note that

y0 = 0 ,

x0 = ǫx ≪

1 ,

θ = 0 ,

˜y(˜x) = y(x) .

This expresses merely the fact that the coordinate transformation in eq. (19) leaves the
functional behavior of y(x) invariant. It does not make a diﬀerence whether we refer to
the function by y(x) in the coordinate system Σ or ˜y(˜x) in the system ˜Σ. Then a Taylor
expansion of ˜y(˜x) around x gives

implying that

From eq. (28) it follows that the corresponding changes in the derivatives of y(x) are given
by

˜y(˜x) = ˜y(x) +

The second term in eq. (35) vanishes for q(x) that satisfy the equation of motion (12).

Any transformation that changes the action

[q(x)] in eq. (9) at most by constant is
called a symmetry transformation. Such a transformation does not change the extremal
condition for the action and therefore leaves the EOM invariant. (Note however that not all
transformations that leave the EOM unchanged are symmetry transformations according
to our deﬁnition.) Then, the corresponding Lagrangian could change only by a total
derivative:

S

where F (q, q′) is a function of q and q′. Equating the two results for δ

we ﬁnd that

L

We stress that the expression on the left-hand side is correct for a symmetry transformation
of any function y(x), while the right-hand side is only valid for a transformation of y(x)
that solves the EOM. From eq. (37) it follows that the conserved charge deﬁned as

is a constant with respect to x, i.e. dQ/dx = 0. Consequently it has one speciﬁc value for
all points on a particular solution of the EOM. Obviously Q can only be deﬁned up to a
constant. The above argument, that every continuous symmetry transformation implies a
conserved charge is known as the Noether theorem.

To be explicit let us apply it to a translation in the x direction. Using eq. (29) it follows

We call Px the conserved momentum in the x direction. In fact it is nothing more than
the Legendre transformation of the Lagrangian with respect to q′.
(If the variable of
integration in eq. (9) had been the time t rather the coordinate x then the equivalent
Legendre transformation of the Lagrangian with respect to dq/dt is called the Hamiltonian
and the charge related to time invariance is the energy.)

One might guess that a similar argument for translations in the y direction should
give another conserved charge Py, which is the conserved momentum in the y direction.
However a change in the variable y(x) as in eq. (23) has no eﬀect on q(x) and q′(x), see
eq. (24), implying trivially that

δ

(x, ǫy) = 0 .

L

Thus Noether’s theorem does not help in this case to derive the conserved charge. However
we have already encountered another conserved quantity, which could serve as a candidate
for Py.
In order to absorb the boundary condition into the action we introduced the
Lagrange multiplier λ, which intuitively is related to changes in y, c.f. eq. (9). Eq. (16)
states that λ equals to a complicated function of q, q′ and q′′ for all x. Therefore this
function is a constant of motion. To prove that indeed Py = λ is nontrivial and we will
show this after discussing the conserved charge related to the rotations in eq. (19).

Using eqs. (13) and (14) and the changes in q and q′ under rotations according to

eq. (32) the change in the Lagrangian under an inﬁnitesimal rotation is

would be the sole contribution if y(x) is a straight line (as is the case for ν = 0 or if q′ = 0).
A non-vanishing spin S arises for all the other curves due to their curvature. Note that it
is sensitive to the sign σ of q′.

We would like to come back now to our claim that Py coincides with λ deﬁned in

It follows that the changes in L and S exactly cancel each other such that the total angular
momentum J does not change under rotations, i.e.:

δJ(x, ǫθ) = δL(x, ǫθ) + δS(x, ǫθ) = 0 .

For completeness let us also compute the changes of the three conserved charges under
inﬁnitesimal translations. Since the momenta Px and Py do not depend explicitly on y(x)
they are trivially invariant under translations in the y-direction by δy(x, ǫx), due to eq. (24).
Inﬁnitesimal changes in the x-directions induce δy(x, ǫx) as given in eq. (28) implying that
the change of the nth derivative of y(x) is given by y(n)(x, ǫx) =
ǫxy(n+1)(x), c.f. eq. (29).
Then the changes in the momenta are proportional to their total derivative, which vanishes,

The interpretation of the proportionality factor follows from the following argument.
Any quantity A can be written as a product of a dimensionless number and the dimension
[A]. Since the problem we discuss is purely geometrical we only have a fundamental
length scale l0. So [A] = lµ
0 can be written as some power of this scale. Now the scaling
transformation in eq. (60) can be viewed as a change of the length scale l0 by some fraction
δl0 = ǫal0. Then to ﬁrst order the corresponding change in A is given by

Thus the proportionality factor is nothing more than the dimension of the quantity and
we ﬁnd that [Px] = [Py] = l−ν
. It is reassuring that these results follow

also from dimensional analysis of the deﬁnitions of the conserved charges by noting that
[x] = [y] = l0 and [q(n)] = l−n
allows us to
understand a posteriori why the regime 0 < ν
1 had to be excluded from our analysis. If
ν = 1 the action is invariant under scaling transformations. In particular, we can shrink or
magnify sections of any possible solution and thereby transform it to any arbitrary shape
without changing its action. This explains why for ν = 1 the action only depends on
αi, as mentioned after eq. (6). The physics jargon is to say that the action
∆α = αf −
becomes “soft” when ν approaches unity and it is “critical” at ν = 1. Now if 0 < ν < 1 one
can always ﬁnd a “trivial solution” which is deﬁned as follows: just follow the rays at Pi
and Pf to the point where they intersect and bend the curve in the inﬁnitesimal vicinity of
the intersection point by ∆α. For this curve the action vanishes, since any length element
ds(x) of the straight part of the curve, where r(x) =
, does not contribute to the action
as long as ν > 0. Moreover the (inﬁnitesimal) part of the curve that is bended also does not
aﬀect the action, because from the scaling property of the action we know that it decreases
when shrinking the unit length l0 as long as ν < 1. Consequently continuously scaling down
the region where the bending takes place, we achieve a zero, and hence minimal action.
For ν < 0 the fact that any ﬁnite straight piece of the curve gives an inﬁnite contribution
to the action precludes this solution and for ν > 1 it is not viable since, due to the inverse
scaling, the action blows up if the curve is bended strongly on a section of small length.

∞

The fact that the momenta and the action have somewhat unusual (and ν dependent)
dimensions could easily be remedied by multiplying the Lagrangian in eq. (11) by lν−1
.
Then the action and the angular momenta would be dimensionless and the linear momenta
would have dimensions of l−1
0 .

Using eq. (63) or just applying dimensional arguments it follows that a scaling trans-
formation on the right-hand side of the EOM in eq. (17) results in a multiplication by a
ν)ǫa]. However since the left-hand side is zero it is clear that the EOM is
factor [1 + (1
unchanged in the new coordinate system. The important point to note is that even though
the EOM is invariant under scaling, the transformation in eq. (60) is not a symmetry trans-
formation. The reason is that the change in the Lagrangian under an inﬁnitesimal scaling

V. THE SOLUTION

The coordinate transformations discussed in the previous section are very useful for
actually solving our problem: If we manage to ﬁnd the SCF in some convenient coordinate
system Σ, we can use translations, rotations and scaling to ﬁt the particular solution to any
boundary conditions given in some other coordinate system ˜Σ. Let us consider a particular
solution for which Px = J = 0. Then from eqs. (41) and (48) it follows that

curvature radius and therefore presents the best solution if we only care about minimal
curvature along the curve. For ﬁnite values of ν also the length of the curve plays a role.

We show the functions y(x)+ (solid) and y(x)− (dashed) for various ν in Fig. 2. The two

they can be obtained from each other by a reﬂection with respect to the y-axis. (If one
chooses the constants of integration such that all curves go through (1, 0) the two branches
are related by a reﬂection with respect to the x-axis.) Each SCF changes the sign of its
curvature at x = 0. For large
the SCF is very close to the arc of a circle. The curves
for ν > 1 are below the curve for
and they become “ﬂatter” and thus shorter
for smaller values of ν. The curves for positive ν approach x = 0 with a vanishing slope
and their curvature radius diverges at x = 0. The closer ν is to unity the sooner the curve
approaches the value y(0) when x
0 (which can be understood from the scaling behavior
of the action c.f. section IV). The curves for ν < 0 all reside above the curve corresponding

The standard smooth connection functions shown in Fig. 2 are the fundamental so-
lutions to the boundary problem we want to solve. Any speciﬁc solution consists of a
segment of a standard smooth connection function that can be viewed as a template which
may be rotated, translated and scaled in order to ﬁt the boundary conditions. Before we
continue to describe in detail how this can be done, it is useful to extend the SCF beyond
the interval they are deﬁned on.

To this end we note that from eq. (70) it follows that the curvature radius, deﬁned in

eq. (4), is given by

It has the same value for the two branches of the SCF in eq. (72). Therefore, even though
q(x) diverges at

Thus it is natural to connect the two solutions y(x)± to one single curve and for the
following we shall ﬁx the constant of integration such that lim|x|→1 y(x) = 0 for all curves.
The problem is that these curves are not single-valued. In order to express them as a single
function we simply exchange the coordinates x and y. The resulting curves are shown in
1 < x < 1.

it is not diﬃcult to obtain a speciﬁc SCF for any given boundary conditions in eqs. (2)
and (3). The basic idea is to ﬁnd ﬁrst two points ˜Pi and ˜Pf on a “standard SCF”, where the
slopes correspond to the required angles αi and αf , and then to apply a set of coordinate
transformations to the curve in order to match the boundary conditions. The ﬁrst step
implies that we have to check whether it is possible to ﬁnd positions ˜xi and ˜xf somewhere
on the standard SCF such that

q(˜xi) = tan(αi + ˜α0)

q(˜xf ) = tan(αf + ˜α0) ,

Of course such an iterative procedure will only converge provided that for a given ν one
can indeed ﬁnd two points on the standard SCF that satisfy eq. (78). The important
observation is that using the extended standard SCFs (as shown in Fig. 3) it is possible to
ﬁnd a suitable segment of the curves for any given pair of (αi, αf ). Thus we will use these
curves in the following.

In general the endpoints ˜Pi and ˜Pf of the ﬁtting segments do not satisfy the boundary
conditions in eqs. (2) and (3). However, it is important to realize that neither translations,
nor rotations, nor scaling transformations change the angles αi and αf . This is because
they are deﬁned relative to the line through ˜Pi and ˜Pf . The only variable in eq. (78) that
does change under coordinate transformations is the angle ˜α0 that deﬁnes the direction of
this line with respect to the x-axis. Thus we can apply a rotation in order to match ˜α0 with
any given value in eq. (3) for α0. Since ˜α0 is deﬁned as the ratio between the diﬀerences

(78)

(79)

(80)

(81)

(82)

of the coordinates of ˜Pi and ˜Pf [see eq. (79)] it is invariant under translations and scaling
transformations. This enables us to satisfy also the boundary conditions in eq. (2) by ﬁrst
scaling the (rotated) SCF ˜y(˜x) such that the distance between ˜Pi and ˜Pf coincides with the
distance between Pi and Pf and then translating the resulting curve such that it connects
these points. The SCF obtained like this satisﬁes both eq. (2) and eq. (3). In Fig. 4 we
show a speciﬁc set smooth connection functions, each corresponding to a diﬀerent ν, that
all satisfy the same boundary conditions. Various other examples of smooth connection
functions, that all have been obtained by the numerical recipe described above, are shown
in Fig. 5. Each plot corresponds to a particular choice of (αi, αf ) and shows the behavior
of the solution for ﬁve diﬀerent values of ν.

Finally we would like to compare the SCF discussed in this paper with other “conven-
tional” interpolation functions. In particular for practical purposes it is important to know
how much better the optimal path (i.e. the SCF) is with respect to some approximation.
To this end it is useful to have a closed expression for the action in eq. (6), which deter-
mines the “smoothness” of any curve y(x). Using eq. (41) its integrand can be written in
terms of the linear momenta as

where the dot denotes a derivative with respect to t. We note that in principle one could
also minimize this action in order to determine the smooth connection functions. However
in this case the Euler-Lagrange formalism results in two coupled non-trivial diﬀerential
equations, which appear to be even harder to solve than the EOM we got in eq. (17).
Using eq. (85) we have computed the weight functional for cubic Bezier curves. In general
for small ν the SCF can be well-approximated by an appropriate Bezier curve and the
respective values for the action only diﬀer at most by a few percent. However, for larger ν
it is increasingly diﬃcult to match the SCF by a Bezier curve and the diﬀerence between
the actions becomes signiﬁcant. This is because for ν
1 the SCF approaches an arc

≫

18

of a circle which cannot be parameterized by polynomial functions. Thus for applications
where speed is more important than accuracy the Bezier curves are the favorite solution, but
whenever accuracy is crucial or an exact solution is called for then the smooth connection
functions are needed.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK

We have presented a generic solution of how to connect two points in a plane by a smooth
curve that goes through these points with a given slope. Our approach uses extensively
notions that are well-known in classical mechanics. The smooth connection function y(x)
has to satisfy certain boundary conditions and to minimize the action functional that
reﬂects the smoothness of any function by integrating over the inverse curvature radius (to
some power ν) times the length element along the curve. Minimizing the action via the
Euler-Lagrange formalism leads to the equation of motion which is a complicated non-linear
third order diﬀerential equation. However the translational and rotational symmetries of
the problem are of great help, since they imply conserved charges, i.e. the linear and the
angular momenta, that help to simplify the problem signiﬁcantly. Making a speciﬁc choice
for the charges it is possible to obtain the SCF y(x) for a given ν in terms of hypergeometric
functions. Applying the appropriate coordinate transformation to this solution allows to
adjust the SCF to arbitrary boundary conditions.

We have worked out in detail the basic formalism to ﬁnd explicitly the smoothest con-
nection between two points in the two dimensional Euclidean space. Several generalizations
and extensions of this basic problems are possible: First, the number of points that de-
ﬁne the SCF can be increased. For a single curve the solution will still be determined by
four boundary conditions, but one may choose diﬀerent conditions than those in eqs. (2)
and (3). Also it is possible to paste together several elementary solutions in order to ﬁnd
interpolations between several points which cannot be achieved by a single SCF. How to
do this best gives rise to a new optimization problem. Finally we note that one can also
choose to apply our formalism to a diﬀerent geometry. For example one may consider a
t2.
time-dependent SCF x(t) in Minkowski space, where the metric is deﬁned via r2 = x2
Also extensions of the problem to higher dimensional spaces are conceivable. In this case
the SCF would describe some smooth manifold that connect two extended objects (like
strings).

FIG. 3. Extended standard smooth connection functions for various ν. These functions are
obtained from the SCFs of Fig. 2 by exchanging the coordinates x and y. All curves have been
rescaled such that they are deﬁned in the interval
1/2 < x < 1/2
corresponds to the SCFs of Fig. 2. The continuations beyond x =
1/2 use a segment of the
other branch, which is attached to the centerpiece such that the curvature radius is continuous
at x =

1 < x < 1. The interval

1/2.

FIG. 4. Example for a speciﬁc set of smooth connection functions that all satisfy the same
boundary conditions. Each curve corresponds to a diﬀerent ν as indicated in the legend. All the
solutions consists of a segment of an extended standard smooth connection function that can be
viewed as a template which may be rotated, translated and scaled in order to ﬁt the boundary
conditions. This example corresponds to αi = 20◦ and αf = 70◦.

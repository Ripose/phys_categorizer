A structurally right/left–handed ferrocholesteric slab with negative real permittivi-

ties and permeabilities is theoretically shown to display the Bragg phenomenon on ax-

ial excitation as if it were a structurally left/right–handed ferrocholesteric slab with

positive real permittivities and positive real permeabilities.

In addition to the promise

of isotropic homogeneous materials with negative real permittivities and permeabilities

for unexpected applications, the presented results underscore the similar potential of

anisotropic nonhomogeneous materials with analogous characteristics.

Dielectric and magnetic materials are ubiquitous. Their linear electromag-

netic response properties are characterized by permittivity and permeability dyadics

which depend on the frequency of excitation and comprise complex–valued scalar

components. The permittivity and the permeability dyadics (i.e., second–order ten-

sors) of an isotropic material reduce to complex–valued scalars. The real parts of

these scalars can be negative or positive, but the latter possibility is the norma-

tive one of the two, as the perusal of almost any undergraduate electromagnetics

textbook will show. However, the former possibility does exist for natural materi-

1

als such as metals, plasmas and ferrites [1, 2]. Most recently, composite materials

which eﬀectively have both negative real permittivity and negative real permeabil-

ity in a certain frequency range have been fabricated and satisfactorily tested [3, 4],

notwithstanding the discounting of anisotropy, nonhomogeneity and dissipation in

the sample materials [5].

Technological bonanzas have been proﬀerred, provided homogeneous, isotropic

and virtually non–dissipative materials with negative permittivity and negative per-

meability can be economically manufactured [5, 6, 7]. These potential beneﬁts are

based on the opposite directions of the phase velocity and the velocity of energy

transport in these materials. Available results indicate that these materials would

be realized in the form of multilaminar slabs, each lamina itself being anisotropic

due to the imprinting of various features thereon [4, 7]. Feature geometries other

than the only one in current use will also arise, sooner or later. These open up the

possibility of an entirely new class of prospective materials: ferrocholesterics with

negative permittivity and negative permeability. This Communication is devoted to

these unidirectionally nonhomogeneous materials.

About twenty years before the discovery of cholesteric liquid crystals by Reinitzer

in 1888 [8], Reusch [9] presented structurally similar materials made from uniaxial

dielectric laminas, which can possibly be fabricated as unidirectional ﬁbrous com-

posites. The laminas are identical, with the sole optic axis lying in the laminar

plane. The laminas are stacked sequentially, the optic axis in any particular lam-

ina oﬀset by a small angle in the laminar plane from the optic axis of the lamina

lying immediately below it. The successive optic axes rotate helicoidally, and the

optical response properties of the entire structure resemble those of a cholesteric

liquid crystal at frequencies below a certain maximum [10]. The optical response of

2

cholesteric materials in the liquid crystalline form has been intensively studied and

technologically exploited [11, 12].

Just about a century later, Brochard and de Gennes [13] incorporated parallel

magnetic needles in the laminas, giving rise to the so–called ferrocholesteric mater-

ials. Let the thickness direction of a ferrocholesteric material be parallel to the x3

axis of a cartesian coordinate system (x1, x2, x3). The simplest eﬀective constitutive

equations of this material are as follows:

−

(cid:3)
µa) cc

−

(cid:3)

B(x) = µ0

µa I + (µb

• H(x) .

Here, ǫ0 and µ0 are the permittivity and the permeability of free space (i.e., vacuum);

I is the identity dyadic; the unit vector

c = ˆx1 cos(πx3/Ω) + h ˆx2 sin(πx3/Ω)

involves the helicoidal pitch 2Ω; the parameter h = +1 for structural right–handed-

ness, and h =

1 for structural left–handedness, while the scalars ǫa,b and µa,b are

−

complex–valued functions of the angular frequency ω.

As a ferrocholesteric material is periodically nonhomogeneous, it must exhibit

the circular Bragg phenomenon [14]. Most signiﬁcantly, if a circularly polarized

plane wave with angular frequency in the so–called Bragg regime were normally in-

cident on a ferrocholesteric slab 0

x3

L (which is thus excited axially), and the

≤

≤

ratio L/Ω were suﬃciently high, it will be almost completely reﬂected if its hand-

edness matches the structural handedness of the slab. Virtually no reﬂection would

occur if the two handednesses do not coincide. The importance of this polarization–

discriminatory characteristic in optics cannot be exaggerated, as it is exploited for

a variety of polarization–sensitive ﬁlters and laser mirrors [12].

3

The reﬂectances and the transmittances of axially excited ferrocholesteric slabs

of inﬁnite lateral extent were calculated by following an established procedure [15].

These quantities were organized as the 2

Here, the subscript RL indicates the intensity of either a reﬂected or a transmitted

right circularly polarized plane wave in relation to the intensity of an incident plane

wave that is left circularly polarized; and so on.

In Figure 1 are shown the reﬂectances and the transmittances as functions of

the free–space wavelength λ0 = 2π/ω√ǫ0µ0 for a ferrocholesteric slab with the

following properties: ǫa = 3(1 + 0.001i), ǫb = 3.3(1 + 0.001i), µa = 1.2(1 + 0.002i),

µb = 1.5(1 + 0.002i), h = 1, Ω = 14 mm and L = 40Ω. Dispersion was ignored in

this illustrative study, and an exp(

iωt) time–dependence was assumed. Diﬀerential

−

reﬂection of incident left/right circularly polarized plane waves is clearly in evidence

in the Bragg regime, which spans the wavelength range λ0

[53.2, 62.3] mm. As the

∈

chosen material is structurally right–handed, RRR and TLL are enormously larger

than the negligibly small RLL and TRR in the Bragg regime. The cross–polarized

reﬂectances and transmittances — RRL, etc., — are also very small, and can be

further reduced by the use of impedance–matching layers.

The calculations for Figure 1 were repeated, except with the following changes

in the input parameters: ǫa =

3(1

0.001i), ǫb =

3.3(1

0.001i), µa =

1.2(1

0.002i). These values are in accord with the Lorentz oscillator

model [1, 4], and therefore do not violate the principles of causality and energy

conservation. The calculated reﬂectance and transmittance spectrums are shown

in Figure 2. The circular Bragg phenomenon is preserved, but with a diﬀerence.

Despite the fact that the chosen material is still structurally right–handed, now

RLL and TRR are enormously larger than the negligibly small RRR and TLL. The

cross–polarized quantities remain unaﬀected.

In other words, a structurally right/left–handed ferrocholesteric slab with neg-

ative real permittivities and negative real permeabilities will display the circular

Bragg phenomenon on axial excitation as if it were a structurally left/right–handed

ferrocholesteric slab with positive real permittivities and positive real permeabilities.

Due to mathematical isomorphism, this conclusion would also hold for ferrosmectic

materials [16, 17].

The reason underlying the foregoing symmetry can be understood by examining

the characteristics of the axial propagation modes in ferrocholesteric and ferrosmec-

tic materials; detailed expressions are available elsewhere [16]. The propagation

modes are either left or right elliptically polarized, with their respective vibration

ellipses rotating along the x3 axis in accordance with the structural handedness of

the material [18]. Let dissipation be weak. When the real parts Re [ǫa,b] > 0 and

Re [µa,b] > 0, the direction of the phase velocity of a particular mode is the same

as the (common) direction of energy transport and attenuation. However, when

Re [ǫa,b] < 0 and Re [µa,b] < 0, not only does the phase velocity reverse in direction,

but the handedness of the vibration ellipse also reverses, while the direction of en-

ergy ﬂow and attenuation as well as the sense of rotation of the vibration ellipse

remain unchanged. The reversal of the modal handedness is thus responsible for the

left/right switching between the spectrums of Figures 1 and 2.

The Lorentz and the Drude models for oscillators are well–known [1]. These

models yield negative as well as positive values for Re[ǫa,b, µa,b] in diﬀerent parts

of the electromagnetic spectrum, while the imaginary parts Im[ǫa,b, µa,b] must be

5

always positive. If the electric and the magnetic resonances are close to one another,

the spectral regime of negative permittivities and permeabilities may be accessible

simply by increasing the frequency across all the resonances.

To conclude, many interesting phenomenons (such as anomalous refraction and

reversed Doppler shifts) and applications (such as distortion–free lenses) have been

forecasted for isotropic homogeneous materials with negative real permittivity and

permeability [3]–[5]. The technology for fabricating these materials can also be used

for structurally nonhomogeneous materials with analogous constitutive properties.

Due to their anisotropic and nonhomogeneous constitution, many unexpected phe-

nomenons and applications are likely to emerge.

case of planar geometry the ﬁnite ﬂocking behavior is obtained. The circulation of the velocity ﬁeld
is found not to be conserved as a consequence of the nonholomicity. The stability of ordered motion
with respect to noise is discussed. An analogy with the kinetics of charges in superconductors is
noted.

The emergence of ordered structures in dynamic sys-
tems is a long standing problem in physics. Generally
speaking one deals with dynamic phase transitions gov-
erned either by external or internal noise. Most inter-
esting is the arising of ordered motion caused by the in-
ternal dynamics of the system. Recently, there has been
a growing interest in studying the collective behavior in
systems of self-propelling particles (SPP). One may dis-
tinguish systems of two types:

The ﬁrst one is for systems of “unintelligent“ parti-
cles interacting via real physical forces produced by the
background in which they are moving (micelles, bacteria,
etc). Here the driving forces are caused by the gradients
of chemical factors (concentrations, chem. potential etc.)
or physical factors (light, potential and dissipative ﬁelds
etc.), which inﬂuence the motion. In particular, the earth
magnetic ﬁeld is vital for the orientation during long dis-
tance migration of biological species like birds or turtles
[1, 2] .
It is clear that the absence of conservation of
translational and angular momentum is a direct conse-
quence of these external factors [3].

The second class is formed by systems of particles,
which interact via nonholonomic constraints imposed on
their velocities. We would like to stress that the non-
holonomicity of such systems clearly expresses the “in-
telligent“ nature of the particles, since such constraints
need instant exchange of information (visual or any other
sensorial) between the particles and their environment.
This explains the coherent motion and arising ordered
patterns in the dynamics of systems like crowds, traﬃc
or ﬂocking. Usual potential gradients or other physical
forces are not relevant for the collective behavior, though
the particles need some physical source of energy to sus-
tain the constraints. The physical origin of the nonholo-
nomicity is the force which acts on the particle due to its
interaction with the background (earth, air, liquid sub-
strate etc.). Since we are not interested in the dynamic
degrees of freedom of the background we lose this infor-

mation. Such loss of dynamic information leads to the
breaking of the conservation of the (angular) momen-
tum and eﬀectively to the nonholonomic constraints. In
general it means that the system with such constraints
is not closed and therefore its dynamics is not Hamilto-
nian, though it does not mean that the energy dissipates.
Rather a redistribution among the dynamic degrees of
freedom takes place. But the very form of the constraint
is determined by the “intellect“ of a particle which uses
the information about the environment and moves ac-
cordingly. Note that the numerical algorithm used in
Ref. [4] modelled that kind of systems. For shortness we
call it the Czir´ok-Vicsek automaton or algorithm (CVA).
There are also modiﬁcations of this algorithm, which dif-
fer from the CVA by inclusion of potential interparticle
forces [5], external regular and stochastic ﬁelds [6]. We
will consider CVA as the minimal model for the collective
behavior since the main cause for the self-organization in
the system is the nonholonomicity of CVA dynamic rule.
To our knowledge none of the hydrodynamic models
proposed earlier is aimed to reﬂect the essence of the
CVA - its conservative and distinctly nonholonimic char-
acter. To a great extent such models are modiﬁcations
of the Navier-Stokes equation. Such an approach is cer-
tainly valid for microorganisms ﬂoating in a medium. It
is, however, hardly adequate for the collective behavior
of ”intelligent” boids, e.g. birds or drivers in traﬃc ﬂow
[7], when the individual behavior is determined rather
by the instant exchange of information with the envi-
ronment than by the action of some interparticle forces.
The key point here is the nonholonomicity of the system.
In addition all the models based on the modiﬁcations of
the Navier-Stokes equation like Ref. [8, 9] include addi-
tional phenomenological terms which generate the “spon-
taneous“ transition to the state of ordered motion. Such
terms are added much in formal analogy with Landau’s
theory of equilibrium continuous phase transitions and
the notion of an order parameter but any ﬁrm base for

such an analogy is not given. Thus the ordered state in-
troduced in such a model is rather an ad hoc assumption
than the natural consequence of the underlying interpar-
ticle interactions. The interpretation of the viscous term
for such systems is also completely unclear.

In Ref. [8] it was noted that the CVA can be considered
as the dynamic XY -model. It was concluded also that
the cause of the ordering is the convective term. The
XY -model is a Hamiltonian dynamic system. The latter
property is the key point since for Hamiltonian dynamic
ﬂow there is an ergodic measure. Due to nonholonomic
character the dynamic rule of the CVA even in the static
limit |v| → 0, i.e. when there is no any transfer ﬂow
term like v · ∇, has no canonical Hamiltonian form. The
general fact is that such systems do not have an invari-
ant measure with respect to the dynamic ﬂow. In fact
the ordered state in the CVA appears as the ﬁxed point
(attractor) of its averaging dynamic rule. Note that from
the point of view of the theory of dynamic systems the
compactness of the phase space (i.e. the space of posi-
tions and velocities) is very important so the question
about inﬂuence of the boundary conditions usually used
in simulations on the ordering the system also needs dis-
cussion.

From such a nonholonomic point of view the appear-
ance of ordered motion in the CVA and similar dynamic
systems is a trivial consequence of their nonholonomic-
ity. Indeed, the breaking of conservation of the (angular)
momentum is due to nonholonomic constraints which as
has been mentioned above mean that the system is not
closed.

Here we discuss a hydrodynamic model which can be
considered as the continuous analogue of the discrete dy-
namic automaton proposed in Ref. [4] for the SPP sys-
tem.
It manifestly takes into account all local conser-
vation laws for the number of particles and the kinetic
energy. The self propelling force and the frictional force
are assumed to balance each other.

The algorithm used in Ref. [4] corresponds to the fol-

lowing equation of motion of a particle:

d
dt

vi = ωi × vi,

where ωi is the ”angular velocity” of i-th boid, which
It is

assumed also that the number of particles is conserved.
Like algorithm in Ref. [4], Eq. (1) distinctly expresses the
conservation of the kinetic energy.

From a physical point of view it is natural that the
hydrodynamic model corresponding to the CVA is based
on the following equations:

n(r, t)dV = 0,

nv2 dV = 0 ,

d
dt

ZV
d
dt

ZV

(4)

where n(r, t) and v(r, t) are the number density and the
Eulerian velocity. The volume V moves along with the
velocity ﬁeld. The ﬁrst condition is the conservation of
number of particles. As usual we can rewrite this condi-
tion in the diﬀerential form:

∂n
∂t

+ div (nv) = 0.

The second constraint Eq. (3) means that the kinetic
energy of a Lagrange particle is conserved, i.e.

nv2 dV =

dV = 0.

The ﬁrst integrand vanishes due to the conservation of
the particle number. As a consequence the second inte-
gral also vanishes for an arbitrary choice of the volume
V which in view of the natural condition n ≥ 0 leads to:

|v(r, t)|2 = 0.

d
dt

(6)

This implies that a pseudovector ﬁeld ω exists such that

v (r, t) = ω (r, t) × v (r, t) .

(7)

This equation, which is the continuous analogue of
Eq. (1), has now been derived from the conservation of
particle number and kinetic energy, Eq. (2) and Eq. (3).

We will model ω by:

ω (r, t) =

K (r − r′

) n(r′

, t) rot v(r′

, t) dr′

,

(8)

which has the proper pseudovector character and heuris-
tically may be considered as the continual analog of the
CVA dynamic rule. There are other possible choices like:

(3)

ω (r, t) =

˜K (r − r′

) ∇n (r′

, t) × v(r′

, t)dr′

(9)

and combinations of the two. The averaging kernels K
and ˜K should naturally decrease with the distance in
realistic models. We concentrate our discussion on the
case Eq. (8). Equations (4) and (7) obviously have the
uniform ordered motion with a constant both density and
velocity as trivial solution. One may consider Eq. (7) as
the equation of motion of a charge in a magnetic ﬁeld,
where v is the charge velocity and ω is proportional to
the magnetic ﬁeld. One may even include an “electric
ﬁeld“ and dissipative (collision) terms in Eq. (7):

d
dt

v (r, t) = f + ω (r, t) × v (r, t) − ξv (r, t) ,

(10)

where ξ−1 is the mean free time. We will not consider
such an extended model here since algorithm used in [4]
is distinctly conservative. Further we exploit the anal-
ogy of Eq. (7) and the equation of motion for charges
in superconductors (see e.g. Ref. [10]). In our model a
current density corresponding to the particle velocity at
some point r depends on ”magnetic ﬁeld” ω, i.e. ”vec-
tor potential”, at all neighboring points r′ within some
region of coherence. Therefore the relations (8) or
(9)
can be considered as a corresponding nonlocal relations
between the current density and the vector potential in
nonlocal Pippard’s electrodynamics of the superconduc-
tors. The situation in the system under consideration
is more complex. In electrodynamics of superconductors
the external magnetic ﬁeld is the main cause of the vor-
tical motion of charges since their own magnetic ﬁeld is
negligibly small and does not lead to formation of the
ordered motion. In our case the ”magnetic ﬁeld” ω itself
depends on the motion of “charges“, i.e. particles, and
vise versa, which leads to a nonlinearity of the system.
Depending on the parameters one can expect either the
direct current state since the system is conservative or
vortical states like Meissner currents or Abrikosov vor-
tices.

Using such an analogy let us ﬁnd the conditions for the

existence of the stationary vortical states.

We can rewrite Eq. (7) in the following form:

∂ ω
∂ t

+

∂ W
∂ t

= rot (v × W) ,

(11)

where W(r, t) = rot v−ω . Thus it follows that if W(r, t)
is equal to 0, then ∂ ω/∂ t = 0 and therefore ω = rot v
is independent of the time. Such states are naturally in-
terpreted as stationary translational ω = 0 or rotational
ω 6= 0 regimes of motion. For the model (8) together
with W = 0 we get the integral equation:

K (r − r′

) n(r′

) rot v(r′

) dr′

= rot v(r) ,

(12)

Z

which determines such states. Equation (12) gives sta-
tionary vortical motion, represented by the vector ﬁeld
with |v| = const. From here it follows that the vortic-
ity of the velocity ﬁeld is an eigenstate of the integral
operator with n(r) as the corresponding weight factor.
It should be noted that these stationary states do not
exhaust all stationary vortical states, since in general
∇v2 6= 0.

We further scale K by multiplying with some n∗ and
similarly scale the density by dividing by n∗. Further-
more we restrict our discussion to the simple case of a pla-
nar geometry with averaging kernel in (8) as δ-functional:

K(r − r′

) = s δ(r − r′

) ,

s = ±1.

(13)

We will call this the local model. For this case Eqs. (4)

3

(14)

(15)

and (7) take the form:

+ div (nv) = 0,

∂n
∂t
d
v = s n rot v × v .
dt

These equation (15) can be obtained as a special case
of the corresponding one in Ref. [8].
In our work the
foundation of the terms is given. We do not use general
symmetry arguments to take all terms of a certain sym-
metry into account irrespective of their physical mean-
ing. The corresponding local model with δ-kernel for (9)
may be identiﬁed with rotor chemotaxis (i.e. caused by
chemical ﬁeld) force introduced in Ref. [11] if one takes
into account simple linear relation between ﬁeld of food
concentration and the number density of boids, which is
surely valid for low concentrations of food and bacteria.
The parameter s of the local model (15) distinguishes
diﬀerent physical situations concerning the microscopic
nonholonomical constraint. To see this we ﬁnd the sta-
tionary radially symmetric solutions of (14) and (15). As
usual, we search for the solutions of the form n = n(r),
v = vϕ(r)eϕ. The continuity equation (14) is satisﬁed
trivially. Substituting this into Eq. (15) we ﬁnally ob-
tain:

vϕ(r) =

where r0 is the cut-oﬀ radius of the vortex. This is the
core of the vortex. The constant Cst is determined by
the circulation of the core

v dl = Cst .

r=r0
H
The spatial character of the solution strongly depends
on the parameter s. If s = −1 the inﬁnitely extended
distributions for n(r) are allowed, e.g. n(r) ∝ r−α , α >
0. They lead to localized vortices with exponential decay
of angular velocity. If s = +1 only compact distributions,
i.e. n(r) ≡ 0 outside some compact region, are consistent
with the ﬁniteness of the total kinetic energy i.e. they
corresponds to ﬁnite number of particles
n dV < ∞ .

This implies that for s = +1 the vorticity is damped
by compression along the ﬂow and therefore such a ﬂow
is stable with respect to the vortical perturbations. For
s = −1 the vorticity is damped by expansion.

The hydrodynamics of nonholonomic ﬂuid under con-
sideration diﬀers essentially from the potential dynamics
of ideal ﬂuids [12] due to the nonpotential character of
the equation of motion (7). In ideal ﬂuids the nontrivial
stationary ﬂows are only possible under the inﬂuence of
an external force (pressure gradient or reaction of bound-
aries). Moreover the vorticity in the nonholonomic ﬂuid
is not coserved. This is not a case for usual ideal ﬂuids
where the vorticity is the integral of motion.

The ﬁrst term in right-hand side of Eq. (19) shows the
inﬂuence of compression on the evolution of the vorticity.
The second term represent the modiﬁed spatial transfer
of the vorticity along the ﬂow. Since this term can be ex-
cluded locally by the choice of the instant local reference
frame which moves accordingly with the ﬂow we consider
the ﬁrst term as the main source of the vorticity. In such
an approximation we can write:

rot

= −s

dv
dt

∂ n
∂ t

rot v.

(20)

The circulation is deﬁned by

C(t) =

vdl =

rot vdS,

(21)

I

ZS

where the integration contour and the corresponding sur-
face area move along with the velocity ﬁeld. The time
derivative of the circulation is:

d

C =

dS .

(22)

(23)

Thus the circulation does not conserve in contrast to the
ideal ﬂuid model, where the microscopic interactions are
of holonomic character.

The total momentum P =

n v dV does not conserve

too. For the local model we can write:

R
rot v × v dV .

From Eq. (23) it follows that the damping of vortical
part of the velocity leads to the formation of the state of
uniform motion with P = const.

Here we consider the inﬂuence of noise on the stability
of the ﬂow with respect to the vortical perturbation. It
is clear that instability with respect to such perturba-
tions drives the system to disordered state. Inclusion of
stochastic noise can be done in a way analogous to that
used in Ref. [4]: ω (r, t) = ω0 (r, t) + δω (r, t) , where
ω0 = sn rot v is the same contribution as before and δω
is the stochastic contribution. These ﬂuctuations lead
to ﬂuctuations of the density and velocity ﬁelds. Re-
placing ∂n/∂t by an average value 1/τ plus a ﬂuctuating
contribution δL(t) in Eq. (20) one obtains for the above
described local model with s = +1:

C = −

+ δL

C ,

(24)

(cid:18)
The simplest model for the noise is the Gaussian white
noise approximation:

(cid:19)

h δL(t)δL(t

) i = 2 Γ δ(t − t

) .

(25)

′

The stochastic equation (24) has the solution:

C(t) = C0 exp

−

exp (−W(t)) ,

(26)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

where W(t) =

δL(t′) dt′

is the Wiener process [13].

Averaging over the realization of the stochastic process
we get the averaged evolution of the vorticity:

t
˜τ

τ
1 − τ Γ

,

h C(t) i = C0 exp

−

,

˜τ =

(27)

(cid:18)

(cid:19)
where ˜τ is the relaxation time of the circulation in the
system. For large enough noise τ Γ > 1 the system be-
comes unstable. For τ Γ ≤ 1 the system is stable and the
circulation decays to zero. When τ Γ increases to 1 the re-
laxation time ˜τ goes to inﬁnity, a result similar to critical
slowing down near the critical point. These estimates are
modiﬁed when other terms, which have been neglected,
are taken into account but we believe that qualitatively
the obtained results remain unchanged.

It should be noted that the average kernels can also
contain noise contributions. In view of the above results
for the character of stationary states and vorticity relax-
ation, which depends on the sign of parameter s, this
case needs a more thorough investigation.

In conclusion we have constructed a continuum SPP
model with particle number and kinetic energy conser-
vation. We found in 2D that vortical solutions exist
for the model and that they show a ﬁnite ﬂocking be-
havior. These solutions, which qualitatively reproduce
some results of Ref. [4], were obtained without imposing
any boundary conditions on the velocity ﬁeld. The non-
holonomic constrains were found to lead to a circulation
which was not conserved. The inﬂuence of noise on the
stability of the system was discussed.

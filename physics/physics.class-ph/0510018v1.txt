Two particle realisation of the Poincare group with interaction

Shaun N Mosley,∗ Sunnybank, Albert Rd, Nottingham NG3 4JD, UK

Abstract

A relative position 4-vector is constructed for two spin-zero particles. Some advantages of this

relative position over Bakamjian-Thomas are pointed out. The centre-of-mass (CM) and relative

positions and momenta are an explicit realisation of the so-called non-canonical covariant represen-

tation. The Hamiltonian including potential terms is factorised into CM and relative components,

the latter is a Lorentz scalar readily evaluated in the CM rest frame when the relative position,

momentum are canonical conjugates.

Introduction

In the non-relativistic mechanics of two particle systems, the conversion of the individual particle

generators into centre-of-mass (CM) and relative components has been a fruitful concept. Instead
of the (xi, pi) and (xj, pj) conjugate pairs, one constructs the new conjugate pairs (X, P) and
(¯x, p) , then the Hamiltonian can be written as the sum of CM and relative parts. Potentials which
are scalar functions of ¯x ≡ (xi − xj) can be inserted into the Hamiltonian such that the Galilei
group algebra is maintained, and the two body problem is eﬀectively reduced to one body with a

potential.

In relativistic mechanics this procedure is more diﬃcult. A relative position 4-vector1 qBT was
found by Bakamjian and Thomas [1,2] which will be the starting point of our discussion. We will

use covariant notation throughout, and all the CM and relative generators will be deﬁned in terms
of the individual particle generators jλµ

(where jλµ

More speciﬁcally we introduce interaction terms into the system energy-momentum 4-vector, ie
P λ → P λ

int , so that the usual relations characteristic of the Poincar´e group still hold:

{J λµ, J νρ} = ηλρJ µν + ηµν J λρ − ηλνJ µρ − ηµρJ λν

{J λµ, P ν

(1.3)

We use the classical Poisson brackets (Pb’s) instead of commutators at this stage, to avoid the

technicalities of operator ordering. On quantisation the Pb’s are turned to commutators and a

factor of i included.

We use the following notation. For two 4-vectors a, b : (a ∧ b)λµ ≡ aλbµ − aµbλ ; a · b ≡

aλbλ, η00 = 1 = −ηaa , ηλµ = 0 for λ 6= µ .

1 a 4-vector aλ must satisfy {J λµ, aν} = ηµν aλ − ηλν aµ .

2 Relative position 4-vectors

The various 4-vector relative positions qλ to be considered in this paper all satisfy the Poisson

bracket relation

{qλ , ˆP µ} = 0

where ˆP µ ≡ P µ/|P | . It then follows that we are able to insert a potential V being a function of q
into the system energy-momentum generators P λ as follows

and due to (2.1) the new P λ

int interaction “Hamiltonians” will have zero Pb with each other:

P λ → P λ

int ≡ ˆP λ

(cid:16)|P | + V (q · q) (cid:17)

{P λ

int , P µ

int} = 0 ,

{J λµ, P ν

int} = ηµνP λ

int − ηλν P µ
int

and

also follows if the potential V is a scalar function of q . The Lorentz generators J λµ do not contain

interaction terms, remaining the same as in (1.1). Furthermore we will show that the |P | in (2.2)
can be expressed as a scalar function of the relative momentum vλ , then we will have factorised the
Hamiltonian P 0

int into CM and relative variables.

In using 4-vector notation we appear to have a surplus of components. But the qλ and its
conjugate vλ (to be introduced in the next section) have the property that they are orthogonal to

the system 4-momentum P ≡ pi + pj , ie

so that q0, v0 , can be regarded as dependant variables, and are zero in the system rest frame.

(q · P ) = (v · P ) = 0 ,

(2.4)

The Bakamjian-Thomas relative position

The Bakamjian-Thomas (BT) relative position generator is (see (5.6) of [1])

qλ
BT ≡

jλµ
i Pµ
pi · P

−

jλµ
j Pµ
pj · P

which is by construction orthogonal to the system momentum P λ, a time-like 4-vector. This means
that qλ
BT is space-like or null, then (−qBT · qBT ) is positive so can be regarded as a distance squared,
which is also Lorentz invariant. It was shown in the original paper [1] that in the non-relativistic
limit (−qBT · qBT ) ≃ |xi − xj|2 .

Let us assume that a potential function of this distance, V (−qBT · qBT ) , is included in the
Hamiltonian, then the force on particle i is worked out from {V (−qBT · qBT ) , pi} . We can calculate
from (2.5) and the individual particle Pb’s corresponding to (1.2,3) that

In the system rest frame when P = 0 the force tensor F µρ only has “electric” components
(F 10, F 20, F 30) and the force acts along the space component of qBT . [To include “magnetic” forces
due to the motion of particle j the numerator of F should be of the form (q ∧ pj)µρ instead of
(qBT ∧ P )µρ, which property we will show for the new relative position introduced below.]

We now introduce the 4-vector relative momentum vλ which is the usual relative momentum

in the non-relativistic limit:

vλ ≡

Alternatively v can be written as

vλ = pλ

−⊥ ≡ pλ

− − ˆP λ(p− · ˆP )

with

p− ≡ 1/2(pi − pj) .

It can be shown that (see the appendix)

BT , vµ} = − ηλµ + ˆP λ ˆP µ
and any such variables being orthogonal to P and which satisfy the relation (2.11) we will call “co-
variant conjugates”, as in the system rest frame the components q0

δab in the usual manner (a, b = 1, 2, 3).

BT , v0 are zero, and {qa

An alternative relative position

The construction of the q proceeds as follows. First we introduce the 4-vector

However this q is not necessarily space-like, so next we project q onto the P hyperplane, deﬁning

As the q⊥ is by construction orthogonal to P , it is space-like or null and q−qλ
⊥q⊥λ deﬁnes a Lorentz
invariant distance (which can also be shown to be the usual distance |xi − xj| in the non-relativistic
limit). We can now calculate the following Pb identities (as shown in the appendix)

As above we calculate {−q⊥ · q⊥ , pµ

i } for the force on particle i due to a potential V (−q2

and we see that the force tensor F ′µρ now has “magnetic” components (F 23, F 31, F 12) due to the
motion of particle j , and in fact F ′ is of remarkably similar form to the electromagnetic ﬁeld
produced by particle j if we put V ∝ (−q2

⊥)−1/2 (see for example (14.15) of Jackson [3] ).

Adding (2.9), (2.10) yields the Pb relation between q⊥, P :

{qλ

⇒

{qλ

which means that

{qλ

⊥ , ˆP µ} ≡ {qλ

⊥ , P µ/|P |} = 0

(2.18)

which last relation allows us to introduce potentials into the Hamiltonian as discussed in Sec. 1. To

ﬁnd the Pb relation between q⊥ and v , we ﬁrst subtract (2.15) from (2.14) yielding

We see that q⊥, v , do not qualify as covariant conjugates satisfying (2.11), because of the extra

term on the RHS of (2.19).

There are two ways at arriving at a covariant conjugate pair. The ﬁrst is to deﬁne

′λ ≡ qλ

⊥ −

q

q⊥ · v
v2 + pi · pj (cid:1)

(cid:0)

vλ

then using (2.19) it can be readily shown that

′λ , vµ} = −ηλµ + ˆP λ ˆP µ
(2.21)
so that q′, v are covariant conjugates satisfying (2.11). But it turns out that q′ is none other that
the Bakamjian-Thomas relative position that we have already encountered: the fact that

{q

which is rather a tedious calculation is shown in the appendix.

′

q

≡ qBT

The second way to arrive at a covariant conjugate pair - which we will follow for the rest of

this paper - is to rescale q⊥, v and deﬁne

then inspection of (2.12b) tells us that ρ, π , have the required Pb relation

ρ ≡

q⊥
|P |

,

π ≡ |P |v

{ρλ , πµ} = −ηλµ + ˆP λ ˆP µ .

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.22)

(2.23)

One reason for preferring the pair (ρ, π) for the relative or internal variables is that potential

functions of ρ have the attractive feature of producing electromagnetic type forces (recalling (2.16)),

instead of the pure electric type forces resulting from the BT relative position. In the next Section

we will explore additional reasons for adopting (ρ, π) instead of (qBT , v) as the relative position and
relative momentum 4-vectors, including

(1) it is easier to factorise the Hamiltonian into CM and relative components when the relative

component is expressed in terms of π rather than v . And

(2) the CM and relative variables when these latter are expressed in terms of (ρ, π) are maximally

4

independent and are an explicit realisation of the so-called ‘non-canonical covariant realisation’

(NCR) of [4], as discussed in Sec 4.

3. Factorisation of the Hamiltonian P 0

As discussed at the beginning of Sec 2, the relation (2.1) allows us to introduce an interaction
potential V being a scalar function of −ρ2 into the Hamiltonian

int = ˆP 0
P 0

(cid:16)|P | + V (−ρ2)(cid:17)

(3.1)

while maintaining the Pb relations of the Poincare group algebra.
In this section we will ﬁrst
show that the |P | component in the Hamiltonian can be written in terms of π2, thus achieving a
factorisation of the P λ
int into CM and relative generators. From (2.22), (2.10)

Recalling the interaction Hamiltonian (3.1), the relative (internal) factor

(cid:16)|P | + V (ρ) (cid:17)
is a Lorentz scalar having the same value in any frame. This means that we can choose to evaluate

it in the CM frame, when the ρ, π are conjugate variables, and we can follow the usual procedures

in quantising the internal component of the Hamiltonian as discussed in Sec 5.

The CM factor ˆP 0 in (3.1) is just the usual relativistic dilation factor γ , which means that the
two interacting particles are indeed behaving as one system. Bakamjian [5] noted the advantages of

including the interaction terms in the 4-momentum vector (rather than in the boost generator as in

the original BT paper) on physical grounds, in that the energy of interaction eﬀectively increases

the system rest mass, which in turn must contribute to the system momentum.

4 Relations between the CM and relative variables

The CM generators are R, ˆP where

Rλ ≡ J λρ ˆPρ ,

ˆP λ ≡ P λ/|P |

(4.1)

recalling from (1.1) that J ≡ ji + jj , P ≡ pi + pj . The Rλ is essentially the Shirokov position
4-vector [6] (but note that the Shirokov 4-vector position is J λρ ˆPρ/P 2 , we have multiplied it by |P |
to obtain R , so that R is the covariant conjugate to ˆP rather than P ).

The relative generators are ρ, π which were deﬁned in (2.22) and (2.13). The CM and relative

generators are not in general independent as in the non-relativistic case, except in the system rest

frame. The Pb relations below follow from the deﬁnitions of the generators in terms of ji, jj, pi, pj,
as an example we calculate {Rλ , ρµ} in the appendix.

{Rλ , ˆP µ} = − ηλµ + ˆP λ ˆP µ
{Rλ , Rµ} = J λµ

{ρλ , πµ} = − ηλµ + ˆP λ ˆP µ
{ρλ , ρµ} = 0

{ ˆP λ , ˆP µ} = 0

{πλ , πµ} = 0

also the cross terms

{Rλ , πµ} = ˆP µ πλ

{Rλ , ρµ} = ˆP µ ρλ

{ ˆP λ , ρµ} = 0

{ ˆP λ , πµ} = 0 .

In the system rest frame when P = 0 then R0 = ρ0 = π0 = 0 , and the only Pb’s above which are
non-zero are

{Ra , ˆP b} = δab ,

{ρa , πb} = δab ,

{Ra , Rb} = J ab

when P = 0 .

so that in this case ρ, π are conjugates to each other in the usual sense.

We can split the Lorentz generators J λµ into external and relative parts Lλµ, M λµ such that

where Lλµ, M λµ are

Lλµ + M λµ = J λµ

Lλµ = (R ∧ ˆP )λµ

M λµ = (ρ ∧ π)λµ .

Note that (4.7) only holds for zero-spin particles, additional terms are required to make up the total

angular momentum J if one or more of the particles has spin. For the Pb relations involving L, M,

we introduce the shorthand

ηλµ
⊥ ≡ ηλµ − ˆP λ ˆP µ

Then from the above relations (4.2-6) it follows that

{Lλµ , Rρ} = ηµρRλ − ηλρRµ − M µρ ˆP λ + M λρ ˆP µ

(4.13)

Adding the Lλµ, M λµ pairs above, all generators have the correct 4-vector Pb relations with J λµ .

Finally from the above we can readily determine the Pb relations {Lλµ , Lνρ}, {Lλµ , M νρ}

and {M λµ , M νρ} . In particular

{M λµ , M νρ} = ηλρ

⊥ M µν + ηµν

⊥ M λρ − ηλν

⊥ M µρ − ηµρ

⊥ M λν .

(4.14)

Note that M ≡ (ρ ∧ π) is orthogonal to P , i.e M λµPµ = 0 , which is necessary for the system to
have space inversion invariance [4] and is a consequence of both ρ, π being orthogonal to P . In the

CM rest frame only the components

{M 23, M 31, M 12} → {S1, S2, S3}

exist, and from (4.14) the S obey the same Pb’s as the usual spin 3-vector. Also from (4.11) we see
that M λµ is translation invariant as required for it to represent an internal angular momentum.

The Pb relations relations above mean that R, ˆP , ρ, π are an explicit realisation of the algebra
which Rohrlich [4] labelled the non-canonical covariant realisation (NCR). We have constructed
R, ˆP , ρ, π satisfying the NCR in terms of the individual particle generators ji, jj, pi, pj. This reali-
sation of the NCR is unique.

5 Quantisation and outlook

Much eﬀort was spent by previous workers, for example [7], in ﬁnding CM and relative generators
which are canonical (meaning that Q, P, q, p satisfy the canonical relations {Qa, P b} = {qa, pb} =
δab ) in any inertial frame. Their approach was to ﬁnd the relative position and momentum gener-

ators in the CM rest frame, then Lorentz boost these 3-vector generators to a general frame. This

results in complicated expressions.

Our approach depends on being able to factorise the Hamiltonian into CM and relative com-

(5.1)

where the relative component H(ρ, π) is a Lorentz scalar of ρ, π . We then quantise H in the CM rest
frame, when the ρ, π are conjugate variables satisfying {ρa, πb} = δab , and because H is a Lorentz
scalar it will have the same eigenvalues in any other frame. The CM component ˆP 0 ≡ P 0/|P | is
just the usual relativistic dilation factor γ .

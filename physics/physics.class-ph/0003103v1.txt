Abstract

Abstract – The acoustic coupling between two air bubbles immersed in water

is clearly demonstrated. The system is acoustically forced, and its response is

detected. The experimental results conﬁrm that both theoretically predicted

eigenmodes, respectively symmetrical and antisymmetrical, do exist. Their

frequencies, measured as a function of the bubbles spacing, follow theoretical

estimations within a 10% accuracy.

1. INTRODUCTION

Bubbles play an important role in the sound propagation in everyday life liquids. For

example, the murmur of the brooks essentially originates, as ﬁrst suggested by Bragg [1,2], in

the oscillations of air bubbles captured and dragged along by the water. The so-called “hot

chocolate eﬀect”, namely the rising of sound pitch when one repeatedly taps the bottom of

the mug in which some instant coﬀee or chocolate is being dissolved, is explained by the

releasing into the water of the tiny bubbles trapped in the powder [3,4]. Bubble dynamics and

acoustic properties of liquids containing a large number of bubbles have been widely studied

for a long time [5–10]. Inter alia, the problem of the interaction of two neighbouring bubbles

has been discussed using ﬂuid dynamics tools [11] or the acoustic-electrestatic analogy [12].

Moreover, the free oscillations of a system of two (and even three) air cavities formed in a

metal plate lying on a water surface have been theoretically and experimentally investigated

in detail (including cubic nonlinearities) [13]. The aim of the present article is to present a

simple, readily reproducible, experimental study of the forced oscillation regime of a two-air

bubble system in water. We begin with a short introductory theory in which we show that

the two-bubble system is mostly equivalent to a set of two magnetically coupled electric

circuits.

2. THEORETICAL MODEL

An air bubble in water will be considered as a perfect sphere1 of radius R(t) = R0 + ξ(t),

with variation ξ much smaller than equilibrium value R0. It can be shown that ξ(t) oscillates

with Minnaert’s angular frequency ω0 = q3γP0/ρ0R2

0, where γ is the speciﬁc heat ratio

1 The correction to the Minnaert angular frequency due to deviation from the spherical shape can

be shown to be negligible [14–16].

2

Cp/Cv of air, and P0 and ρ0 respectively stand for the equilibrium pressure2 and mass

density of water. This oscillation is damped through several mechanisms: of course the

acoustic radiation damping (thanks to which the bubble noise is audible), but also the

viscous and thermal dampings [5,7]. We will neglect, in the following simpliﬁed theory, the

last two ones. Moreover, allowing for the typical 1KHz acoustic frequency and 1mm bubble

size we deal with in our experiment, we will neglect any sound propagation in the enclosed

air. We thus deliberately restrict the present study to the (radial) fundamental resonance

of the air bubble-water system.

2.1 One-bubble free oscillation

Let us consider one bubble with radius R0 immersed in an inﬁnite volume of water at

equilibrium pressure P0. Let P (~r, t) be the actual pressure at site ~r and instant t. The extra

pressure p(~r, t) is deﬁned as P (~r, t)− P0. According to Minnaert’s assumption, the enclosed
air undergoes isentropic transformations and its (extra) pressure p(t) is homogeneous inside

the bubble. Then, neglecting air’s inertia as well as the air-water surface tension, p(t) and

the radius variation ξ(t) are linked by:

p(t)
P0

+

3γξ(t)

R0

= 0

(1)

On the other hand, it can be easily shown that (extra) pressure p(r, t) at distance r from

the center of the bubble follows a d’Alembert-like 1D equation, the solution of which exactly

reads, for r ≥ R0:

2 The pressure diﬀerence accross the bubble boundary due to air-water surface tension is about

1%P0 for a typical radius of 1mm (see [5] eq. (65b)) and will be neglected: P0 is also the equilibrium

pressure of enclosed air.

where c is the sound velocity in water. If the acoustic wavelength λ is much larger than

r (i.e., under the circumstances, if condition rω0/c ≪ 1 is fulﬁlled), then p(r, t) can be

which is the well-known diﬀerential equation of a weakly3 damped 1D harmonic oscillator.

2.2 Two-bubble free oscillation

Let us now add a second bubble, with the same (equilibrium) radius R0, at a distance

d apart from the ﬁrst one. Let ~ri (i = 1, 2) be the (equilibrium) position of the ith bubble

center, ξi(t) its radius variation, pi(t) the (inner) extra pressure of the enclosed air, and

pi(~r, t) (resp. ~ui(~r, t) the would-be (outer)extra pressure (resp. displacement with respect

to equilibrium) at point ~r and instant t in the water medium if bubble i was alone. Then,

allowing for the superposition principle for small displacements, we assume that overall water

extra pressure and displacement respectively read:

p(~r, t) = p1(~r, t) + p2(~r, t)

~u(~r, t) = ~u1(~r, t) + ~u2(~r, t)

(5)

(6)

3 Ratio Γrad/ω0 = ω0R0/c is actually assumed to be much smaller than unity, as a consequence

of the the validity condition of eq. (3).

with, of course, pi(t) and ξi(t) still linked by eq.(1). On the surface of the ﬁrst bubble:

r1 = |~r − ~r1| = R0, r2 = |~r − ~r2| ≃ d, and p(~r, t) = p1(t). A similar constraint is required on
the surface of the second bubble, where r1 ≃ d and r2 = R0. If the bubble spacing d is much
smaller than λ (i.e. ω0d/c ≪ 1)4, then eq. (3) is available and we ﬁnally get the following
pair of coupled motion equations:

(7)

(8)

where α = R0/d (< 0.5) can be regarded as a dimensionless coupling constant. Observe,

by the way, that if double condition: R0 ≪ d ≪ λ is fulﬁlled, eqs. (7) and (8) are available
(with α ≃ 0), and dynamic variables ξi are still coupled by radiation damping, since the
dissipation terms do not involve α.

Deﬁning symmetrical and antisymmetrical normal variables φs(t) and φa(t) as respec-

tively the sum and the diﬀerence of ξ1(t) and ξ2(t), we get the uncoupled equations system:

(10)

It is noteworthy that, as far as only radiation is concerned, the symmetrical mode’s damping

rate is twice the single-bubble’s one, while the antisymmetrical mode is undamped.This

feature is easily understood in terms of constructive (resp. destructive) interference between

the acoustic waves radiated by each bubble, and parallels a well-known situation in the

atomic physics domain (super- and sub- radiant quantum states of a couple of identical

atoms interacting with each other through the E.M. ﬁeld). From eqs. (9) and (10), it is
clear that the symmetrical mode has the lower angular frequency ωs = ω0/√1 + α, and the

4 In our experiments λ is of order 1m, while d ranges from 1 to 5 cm.

antisymmetrical mode the higher one ωa = ω0/√1 − α . Observe that, leaving apart the

calculation of radiative damping, it is very easy to derive above expressions of ωs,a using

the following trick. Let us consider the water as an uncompressible ﬂuid (i.e. c → ∞). The
water displacement due to bubble i’s motion simply reads:

~ui(~r, t) = ξi(t)

(11)

with ~eri = (~r − ~ri)/|~r − ~ri| = (~r − ~ri)/ri. Then, allowing for eq. (6), the overall water kinetic

where M0 = 4πR3

where K = 12πγR0P0 is the eﬀective stiﬀness of either bubble. The Lagrange equations

(15)

which is exactly the c → ∞ limit of eqs. (7) and (8). It is worth noticing that eqs. (12)
through (15) are formally equivalent to those of a system of two (L, C) electric circuits

coupled by mutual induction with coeﬃcient αL. In this analogy, M0 and K respectively

correspond to L and 1/C, and the ξi’s to the electric charges qi of either capacitor.

2.3 Forced oscillation

Let us now suppose that the above studied two-bubble system is driven by an external

acoustic source with an angular frequency ω near Minnaert’s one, ω0. The phase diﬀerence

of the driving pressures on both bubbles can therefore be neglected, since ωd/c ≪ 1. Let
pei(t) be the external pressure undergone by bubble i. Motion eqs. (7) and (8) are then

completed in:

with Fes(t) = −(pe1(t) + pe2(t))/ρ0R0(1 + α) and Fea(t) = −(pe1(t) − pe2(t))/ρ0R0(1 − α).
Solving for φs and φa in above eqs. (18) and (19), one gets ξ1(t) and ξ2(t), and conse-

quently (using eq. (3)) quantities p1(~r, t) and p2(~r, t) at any point ~r of the medium. At

last, comparing external (applied) pressure pe(~r, t) with the actual overall extra pressure

p(~r, t) = pe(~r, t) + p1(~r, t) + p2(~r, t), we can experimentally measure the two-bubble system’s

response as a function of ω.

In this respect (and provided that the excitation-detection

geometry allows it), resonances are expected for ω = ωs and ω = ωa.

3. EXPERIMENTS

Our aim is to demonstrate the existence of both above mentioned modes. From an

experimental point of view, it turns out to be easier to implement a forced oscillation scheme

than a free oscillation one. We therefore present the former hereafter.

7

3.1 Experimental setup

A small net (see ﬁg.1), made up with a gauze maintained with a wire, is designed to

catch up an air bubble in water and to ﬁx it at any desired position without appreciably

modifying acoustic impedance and spherical symmetry.

Two such devices are used for studying the two-bubble system. The external driving

source is a speaker and extrapressure p(~r, t) is measured with a small microphone. A func-

tion generator, to which the speaker is connected, produces a c.w. sinusoidal signal with a

frequency slowly swept from flow to fhigh. The signal delivered by the microphone is trans-

mitted to a lock-in ampliﬁer which compares it with the reference one (delivered by the

function generator) and decomposes it into real and imaginary parts. Both parts can be

seen on an oscilloscope and recorded with a computer (see ﬁg.2).

In a preliminary set of experiments, without any bubble in the aquarium, the response of

the microphone is calibrated for diﬀerent speaker-microphone conﬁgurations. Two kinds of

conﬁgurations are presented in ﬁgure 3. In ﬁgs. 3(a) and 3(b) the conﬁguration is deliberately

asymmetrical: the microphone is mainly susceptible to bubble 2’s motion, while the speaker

selectively drives bubble 2 (ﬁg. 3(a)) or bubble 1 (ﬁg. 3(b)), so that Fea(t) is nonzero: both

modes can be excited and the associated motions detected. In ﬁg. 3(c), the speaker is placed

far from the bubbles; then, not only the phases, but also the amplitudes of the external

pressures p1e(t) and p2e(t) undergone on either bubble are appreciably equal.

In such a

symmetrical excitation conﬁguration, Fea(t) = 0, so that the antisymmetrical mode remains

unexcited. Observe, by the way, that since distances r1 and r2 between the bubbles and

the microphone are equal, the latter would detect no contribution from the antisymmetrical

mode even though it was excited (see eqs.(3) and (5): r1 = r2 and ξ1 = −ξ2 yields p1(r1, t) +
p(r2, t) = 0 ).

8

3.2 Results and discussion

In ﬁgs. 4(a) and 4(b), the imaginary part Im p of the output signal from the lock-

in ampliﬁer is displayed versus the speaker frequency f for various values of the bubbles

spacing d. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) respectively correspond to conﬁgurations 3(a) and 3(b).

Two resonances can be made out in ﬁg 4(a) and (though at a lesser degree) in ﬁg 4(b).

Observe that the sign of the signal at the higher frequency resonance is changed from 4(a)

to 4(b), while the lower frequency one remains unchanged. This is consistent with the latter
signal being associated with the symmetrical mode’s resonance (ωs = ω0/√1 + α < ω0, and

Fes unchanged from conﬁguration 3(a) to 3(b)), and the former one with the antisymmetrical

mode’s resonance (ωa = ω0/√1 − α > ω0, and Fea changed into −Fea from conﬁguration

3(a) to 3(b)).

It is noteworthy that both resonances have appreciably the same width. This is in

contradiction with simpliﬁed eqs.(9) and (10) (or (18) and (19)), in which only the radiation

damping was considered.

In fact, as mentioned in introduction, other kinds of damping

(namely viscous and thermal dampings) should be taken into account. Discussing this point

is out of the scope of the present paper. In ﬁgure 5, we have plotted, for both symmetrical and
antisymmetrical modes, and for R0 ≃ 2mm, the inverse squared frequency f −2 (multiplied
by a factor of 107) versus the inverse bubble spacing d−1, in order to get a visual check of

theoretical relations:

Although experimental points are appreciably aligned, the measured slopes are about

40% below theoretical prediction, suggesting that coupling constant α has been overesti-

mated.

In fact, theoretical value α = R0/d was derived in eq.(12) when integrating the

9

water kinetic energy density 1

2ρ0( ∂~u

∂t )2 over the whole space5. This inertial coupling is nat-

urally lowered if some obstacle lies between the bubbles and consequently screens (part of)

the water ﬂow6. Now, this is exactly what happens in conﬁgurations 3(a) and 3(b): to be

able to excite the antisymmetrical mode, we are compelled to insert the speaker between

the two bubbles, thus bringing about the above screening eﬀect. In order to check this inter-

pretation, we performed the same experiment with conﬁguration 3(c), and recorded, for the

symmetrical branch of the linear ﬁtting of ﬁg. 5, a slope of about 90% of the theoretically

predicted value.

4. CONCLUSION

As a conclusion, the acoustic inertial coupling between two air bubbles in water has been

experimentally put in evidence. Theoretical analysis shows that the two-bubble system is

formally equivalent to a set of two magnetically coupled (L,C) electric circuits, with two

eigenmodes, respectively symmetrical and antisymmetrical. Experimental measurements

and theoretical predictions are in 10% accuracy agreement.

5 More precisely: over the whole space outside the two bubbles (the inner air’s inertia being

negligible). Nevertheless, it can be shown that the coeﬃcient of coupling term ξ

′

1ξ

′

2 in integral (12)

does not depend on the bubbles radius R0.

6 The eﬀective mass M0 is modiﬁed too, but at a lesser degree.

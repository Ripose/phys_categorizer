Abstract. New method of introducing vortex lines of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
is outlined. The vortex lines arise when a complex Riemann-Silberstein vector
(E + iB)/√2 is multiplied by a complex scalar function φ. Such a multiplication
may lead to new solutions of the Maxwell equations only when the electromagnetic
ﬁeld is null, i.e. when both relativistic invariants vanish. In general, zeroes of the
φ function give rise to electromagnetic vortices. The description of these vortices
beneﬁts from the ideas of Penrose, Robinson and Trautman developed in general
relativity.

1. Introduction

Complex scalar ﬁelds in a three-dimensional space carry generically a collection of
vortex lines. These vortex lines are located at the zeroes of the ﬁeld. Complex
generic vector ﬁelds do not have such properties because the requirement that all ﬁeld
components simultaneously vanish leads to an overdetermined set of equations. There
are at least two ways to overcome this diﬃculty and to introduce vortex lines also
for vector ﬁelds. One may either select one relevant component of the ﬁeld (as, for
example, in the scalar theory of light) or one may build a single ﬁeld entity from
various vector components. The ﬁrst approach has been used in most papers on phase
singularities in wave ﬁelds (for a thorough review and list of references see [1]). In our
previous publication [2] we have chosen the second method. We have studied phase
singularities and vortex lines associated with the zeroes of the square F
F of the
Riemann-Silberstein
‡

(RS) vector (my units are chosen so that ǫ = 1 and µ = 1)

·

F = (E + iB)/√2.

The vortex lines of the electromagnetic ﬁeld deﬁned in this manner are rather elusive
objects —they lack clear signature and may be hard to observe. Even though the
phase of the ﬁeld has dislocations, the electromagnetic ﬁeld does not vanish on these
vortex lines, but it is just a null electromagnetic ﬁeld — the two relativistic ﬁeld
invariants vanish on vortex lines. Nevertheless, the vortex lines built on F
F may still
·
have some role to play in singular optics as discussed in the papers by M. Berry [5]
and G. Kaiser [6] appearing in this issue.

In the present paper I explore a diﬀerent approach. It is based on the observation
that when a null solution of the Maxwell equations is taken as the background ﬁeld, an
extra scalar multiplier may imprint on this solution a rich vortex structure. This time
all components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld will vanish on vortex lines. Of course, the
vortex lines that are introduced in this manner do not have a generic character since
they are found only in special cases — for null ﬁelds. However, the class of solutions
of the Maxwell equations that carry these vortex lines is, in my opinion, suﬃciently
broad and interesting to make this approach relevant for singular optics. In addition,
the present study touches upon some important concepts discovered before in the
general relativistic context.

2. Scalar prefactor as a carrier of phase singularities

The starting point of this investigation is an observation that a complex scalar function
φ(r, t) multiplying the RS vector will control the zeroes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Wherever φ(r, t) vanishes, the electric and magnetic ﬁeld vectors vanish. Assuming
that the background ﬁeld F , as well as the product φF , satisfy the Maxwell equations

i∂t (φ(r, t)F (r, t)) =

i∂tF (r, t) =

This name was introduced in a review paper [3] on the photon wave function, where one may also
‡
ﬁnd information on the history of the Riemann-Silberstein vector. The ﬁrst to make a practical use
of the RS vector in the analysis of electromagnetic waves was Bateman [4]. The RS vector oﬀers a
very convenient representation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, especially in the study of vortex lines,
and I shall make an extensive use of it here.

we arrive at the following conditions on the prefactor ﬁeld φ(r, t) (to simplify the
notation, from now on I omit the dependence of F on space-time coordinates)

This set of equations possesses nontrivial solutions only when the background ﬁeld is
null, i.e. F 2 = E2/2
B = 0. In order to prove this assertion, we can take
·
the scalar product of both sides of Eq. (4) with the vector F . Since the scalar product
on the right hand side is equal to zero, the left hand side must also vanish and this
results in the following alternative: either ∂tφ(r, t) or F
F must vanish. In the ﬁrst
case, we end up with a trivial result: the scalar function φ(r, t) must be a constant.
It cannot depend on space and time variables since its gradient is at the same time
parallel to F , as seen from Eq. (4), and orthogonal to F , as seen from Eq. (5). In the
second case we may have a nontrivial form of φ(r, t). Taking the scalar product of
Eq. (4) with the complex conjugate RS vector F ∗ we obtain the condition

The solutions of Eqs. (7) will in general have zeroes and this will lead to vortex
lines of the electromagnetic ﬁeld riding atop the background solution F . On each
vortex line the electromagnetic ﬁeld vanishes. Near the vortex line the electric and
magnetic ﬁeld vectors followed around a closed contour rotate by 2πm, where m is the
topological charge of the vortex. In contrast to nonrelativistic wave mechanics [7, 8],
there is no interaction between vortex lines introduced in this manner. All vortices
move independently, since the product of solutions of the ﬁrst order partial diﬀerential
equations (7) is again a solution. We may always add new vortices without changing
the motion of the existing ones. In the following sections I shall give general solutions
of Eqs. (7) in two special cases: when the background ﬁeld is a plane monochromatic
wave and when it is the Robinson-Trautman ﬁeld.

3. Simple example

Let us consider the solution of the Maxwell equations described by the following RS
vector

F (r, t) = ( ˆx + i ˆy) exp(ikz

iωt).

−

This solution describes the left-handed circularly polarized wave propagating in the z
direction. It is a null ﬁeld, since ( ˆx + i ˆy)
( ˆx + i ˆy) = 0. In this case, Eqs. (7) take on
the form

·

(∂t + ∂z)φ(r, t) = 0,

(∂x + i∂y)φ(r, t) = 0.

(9)

(10)

General solution of these equations is an arbitrary function of two variables: the real
variable z
t and the complex variable x+iy. Thus, we arrive at the family of solutions
of the Maxwell equations of the form

−

F (r, t) = f (z

t, x + iy)( ˆx + i ˆy) exp(ik(z

t)).

where ak(z
inﬁnite vortex line whose shape is determined by the equation x + iy = ak(z
t). Each
vortex line moves independently. In general, each vortex line ﬂies with the speed of
light in the z-direction. However, when the function ak(z
t) is just a constant, the
corresponding vortex line is a stationary straight line in z-direction. A simple example
of the φ function of the type (12) is
φ(r, t) = (x + iy)m.

In this case the RS vector φF carries a straight vortex line along the z-axis with the
topological charge m.

4. Trautman-Robinson ﬁelds

Null solutions of the Maxwell equations were extensively studied by Robinson [9] in
connection with his work in general relativity. In particular, these solutions played
an important role in the discovery of new solutions of Einstein ﬁeld equations [10]
and also they appear in Penrose twistor theory [11]. A family of null solutions of the
Maxwell equations that featured prominently in these studies was described in [12] —
. They are usually expressed in
I shall call them the Robinson-Trautman (RT) ﬁelds
a special coordinate system but I shall use here more intuitive Cartesian coordinates.
In these coordinates the RS vectors representing the RT solutions can be written in
the form

There are some simple solutions with a single vortex line built on this background
function. The simplest ones are obtained by taking the scalar multiplier function φ
equal to βm. These solutions have a stationary vortex line along the z-direction with
m. A bit more complex vortex line is obtained when
the topological charge equal to
φ = α + 4aβ. The vanishing of φ leads to the following two equations for the vortex
coordinates

2y = t,

(x + 2a)2 + z2 = 3a2 +

Thus, at each time the vortex line forms a circle lying on the uniformly moving y = t/2
plane. The radius of the circle is shrinking until t = 0 and then it starts expanding.
Possibilities for constructing solutions with more intricate vortex lines are unlimited.

I would like to thank Michael Berry, Mark Dennis and Gerald Kaiser for discussions
and fruitful comments. I am especially indebted to Andrzej Trautman who shared
with me his profound understanding of complex spacetime.

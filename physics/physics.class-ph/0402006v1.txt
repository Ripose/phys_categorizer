(Dated: January 5, 2004)

We study the aggregation of insulating electrically charged spheres suspended in a nonpolar
liquid. Regarding the van der Waals interaction as an irreversible sticking force, we are especially
interested in the charge distribution after aggregation. Solving the special case of two oppositely
charged particles exactly, it is shown that the surface charges either recombine or form a residual
dipole, depending on the initial condition. The theoretical ﬁndings are compared with numerical
results from Monte Carlo simulations.

INTRODUCTION

Fine powders with particles on the micrometer scale
play an increasing role in diverse technological appli-
cations, ranging from solvent-free varnishing to inhal-
able drugs [2]. A major problem in this context is the
tendency of the particles to clump due to mutual van
der Waals forces [3], leading to the formation of aggre-
gates.
In many applications, however, the aggregates
should be suﬃciently small with a well-deﬁned size dis-
tribution. A promising approach to avoid clumping is
to coat the powder by nanoparticles. The small par-
ticles act as spacers between the grains, reducing the
mutual van-der-Waals forces and thereby increasing the
ﬂowability of the powder. However, the fabrication of
coated powders is a technically challenging task since the
nanoparticles themselves have an even stronger tendency
to clump, forming large aggregates before they are de-
posited on the surface of the grain. One possibility to
delay or even prevent aggregation is the controlled use
of electrostatic forces. As shown in Ref. [7] this can be
done by charging the nanoparticles and the grains oppo-
sitely. On the one hand the repulsive interaction between
equally charged nanoparticles suppresses further aggre-
gation once the Coulomb barrier between the ﬂakes has
reached the thermal energy [8]. On the other hand, at-
tractive forces between the nanoparticles and the grains
support the coating process.

The coating process is most easily carried out if both
fractions of particles are suspended in a liquid (see
Fig. 1). This type of coating processes requires the use
of a nonpolar liquid such as liquid nitrogen. In contrast
to colloidal suspensions in polar liquids, the charged par-
ticles suspended in liquid nitrogen are not screened by
electrostatic double-layers. Both the large and the small
particles are insulators so that the charges reside on their
surface. By choosing diﬀerent materials and charging
them triboelectrically, it is possible to charge the two
particle fractions oppositely in a single process[7].

What are the morphological properties of the coated
surface? Do the nanoparticles reach their countercharges

exactly or do they attach elsewhere on the surface, form-
ing residual dipoles, as sketched in Fig. 2? In order to
address these questions we consider a simpliﬁed situa-
tion, where pointlike particles are deposited on the sur-
face of a plane, representing the surface of an inﬁnitely
large spherical particle (see Fig. 3). One or several posi-
tive charges are located on the planar surface of the big
particle, attracting negatively charged pointlike particles
inserted far away. For simplicity we assume that the par-
ticles are inserted one after another so that mutual inter-
actions during the deposition process can be neglected.
Similarly, we assume that the hydrodynamic interactions
between the particle and the plane can be ignored. Thus
the small particle is subjected to Coulomb forces and
Stokes friction as well as Brownian motion. As shown

where ~r is the position of the particle, ~FC (~r) is the
Coulomb force acting on it, and ~ξ(t) is a white Gaus-
sian noise with the correlations

in Ref. [8], the damping time of suspended nanoparticles
is so short that on the time scale relevant for the coat-
ing process their motion can be assumed as overdamped,
i.e., inertia can be neglected. The van der Waals interac-
tion is interpreted as a purely adhesive force, i.e., once a
particle touches the surface of the large particle it sticks
irreversibly.

In this study we show that a certain fraction of the
particles exactly reach and compensate their counter-
charges. The remaining particles are distributed around
the charges, partly decaying with distance, partly as a
constant background. The fraction that exactly reaches
the countercharges is determined by the interplay be-
tween the magnitude of the charges, the density of the
charges, and the diﬀusion constant.
It can be used as
a measure to what extent a predeﬁned structure of pos-
itive charges at the surface survives during the coating
process.

II. THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS

A. Formulation of the problem

In order to study the deposition process analytically,
one has to solve the equation of motion of the parti-
cle subjected to Coulomb forces, Stokes friction, as well
as Brownian motion. We work in the overdamped limit
which can be justiﬁed as follows. On the one hand, the
viscous motion of the particle decays exponentially on a
time scale

where η is the viscosity of the ﬂuid, a is the particle
radius, and m the particle mass. On the other hand, the
typical time scale for a particle to diﬀuse thermally by
its own diameter is given by

As shown in Ref. [8], under typical experimental condi-
tions in liquid nitrogen trelax is always much smaller than
tdiﬀ, even if the particles are as small as 1 nm. There-
fore, on time scales larger than tdiﬀ, the particle performs
a random walk guided by the balance of Coulomb forces
and Stokes friction. Such a motion can be described by
the Langevin equation

Equivalently, one may formulate the problem in terms of
a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation [1], which describes the
temporal evolution of the probability distribution P (~r, t)
to ﬁnd the particle at point ~r and time t. The FP equa-
tion has the form

B. Solution of the Fokker-Planck equation

In what follows we consider a pointlike particle inserted
at a ﬁnite distance z=L from the plane with random
coordinates x and y, as shown in Fig. 4. The particle
diﬀuses guided by the Coulomb force until it touches the
wall at z=0, where it sticks irreversibly. Our aim is to
compute the probability distribution ρ(r) for the particle

FIG. 4: A thermally diﬀusing particle inserted randomly at ﬁnite
distance z=L is attracted by the target charge at the origin. Once
the particle touches the target plane z=0, which represents the
large particle to be coated, it sticks to its surface due to van-der-
Waals forces. The single-particle problem can be recast as a quasi-
stationary ﬂow of a large number of particles inserted continously
along the source plane which are removed whenever they touch the
target plane.

we consider the problem as a quasi-stationary process,
where many particles are continuously introduced at the
source plane z=L and removed at the target plane z=0
(see Fig. 4). Thus the probability distribution Ps(~r) to
ﬁnd a particle at position ~r is a solution of the stationary

the target charge at the origin, and another region, where
they terminate elsewhere on the surface (see Fig. 5). As
shown in Appendix C it is even possible to calculate the
separatrix exactly. Note that the ﬂux lines and the actual
trajectories of the particles have a diﬀerent meaning.

The density of particles ρ(r) reaching the wall at dis-
tance r from the target charge is proportional to the
normal component of the ﬂux jz(~r)
|z=0. As shown in
Appendix D, we obtain

ρ(r) =

1 + 2δ(r)

(15)

Concerning the problem of several target charges, we note
that in 2D the problem is still analytically solvable. For
a given charge density λ(r) on the target line, the density
of charges reaching the wall becomes

ρ(r) = 1 + 2λ(r) .

(16)

This result stems from the fact that in 2D the station-
ary probability distribution Ps(~r)=z, Eq. (12), is inde-
pendent of the charge position, or more generally, inde-
pendent of the distribution λ. This can be veriﬁed by ex-
plicitly inserting the solution in Eq. (10). The Laplacian
2Ps vanishes so that the resulting equation becomes lin-
∇
ear in the Coulomb potential that is contained in ~u. The
proposed solution for Ps solves the equation for any point
charge, and due to this linearity, it solves the equation for
any charge distribution. In the physically more relevant
three-dimensional case, however, we resort to numerical
methods to study the eﬀect of more charges.

First we want to show that in case of a single charge
ﬁxed at the wall our numerical simulations reproduce
the exact analytical solution. This has to be done, since
the boundary conditions of our simulation setup (diﬀus-
ing particles start from a plane with ﬁnite extent, not
far away from the absorbing wall; additional absorbing
walls conﬁne the simulation space) are diﬀerent from the
boundary conditions of the Fokker-Planck-equation seen
above.

By running the simulation without any attracting
charges ﬁxed at the walls (i.e. particles only diﬀuse) one
can compare simulation results to the homogeneous dis-
tribution of particles on the wall one would expect from
solving the FP equation without any attracting charge.
The numerical results show a homogeneous distribution
of particles hitting the wall in a suﬃciently big region.
However, approximately 14% of the particles hit the ad-
ditional walls surrounding the simulation space, leading
to a reduced inﬂux of particles to the z=0 plane. This
will be taken into account in the following graphs by am-
pliﬁcation of the incoming particle ﬂuxes to compensate
for this loss of particles.

In order to check the numerical results for the case of
one attracting charge ﬁxed at the wall, we calculate the
inﬂux of particles in a circular region of radius R around
the attracting charge. From equation (15), the inﬂux is
given by

Fig. 7 shows the inﬂux obtained in the simulation for dif-
ferent bin sizes R compared to the theoretical inﬂux after
subtraction of the homogeneous background inﬂux. As
one can see, both are in excellent agreement.

the overdamped limit is valid also for the rotational mo-
tion. Again, the rotational motion can be described by a
Langevin equation, i.e.,

∂
∂t

φ =

3M
16ηa3 + ξ(t) ,

(22)

where φ describes the position of the charge relative to
the z-axis, M is the excerted torque on the particle due
to Coulomb forces, and ξ means the brownian rotational
displacement.

When the system consists of two particles, each carry-
ing one charge (of opposite sign), that are located at a
speciﬁed point on the surface, then the Coulomb force
gives a contribution to the rotation as well as to the
translation of the particles. The Coulomb force tends
to rotate the two particles so that the charges approach
the common axis of the particles, the minimum distance.

As one can see, the assumed superposition of the 1/r-
shoulders from the single charge solution ﬁts suprisingly
well, since this kind of superposition is not a solution of
the FP-equation. However, one can see that in the case
of three and four charges, the density of particles near
the outer charges is slightly overestimated.

The relative strength of δ-peaks for diﬀerent numbers
of charges is shown in Fig. 9. Again, this data is obtained
by placing a circular bin around each charge location and
extrapolating the strength of the delta peak from a van-
ishing bin radius. As one can see, the amplitude of the
δ-peak grows by increasing the number of charges. Also,
charges in the center of line always collect more particles
than charges on the edge.

D. Agglomeration of equally sized spherical
particles

So far the limit of one inﬁnitely large particle and one
small particle was examined in detail. Now we address
the other limit, namely two spherical particles of the
same size.

The rotational degree of freedom must be taken into
account when the two particles are of equal size. As
for the translational degree of freedom, we assume that

FIG. 10: Agglomeration of two spherical particles: Average dipole
strength in units of particle radii a as function of the particle radius
in units of the Bjerrum length lB . For particle radii bigger than
the Bjerrum length, the position of charges during agglomeration
is randomized due to Brownian rotation.

Rotational Brownian motion tends to randomize the
orientation of the particles. This means that it is the rela-
tive strength of Coulomb force and Brownian motion that
decide whether the two charges ﬁnd each other upon the
collision, or whether a permanent dipole pertains. The
natural scale for Coulomb energy is the energy of the two
charges two particle radii apart EC = q2/2a. Rotational
Brownian motion is controlled by thermal energy, and if
kBT >> EC the orientation of the particles is completely
random when they collide. The average distance of the
resulting dipole can in this case, by a simple numerical
integration over the surfaces of the disks or the spheres,
be calculated. The numerical values are: 2.26a (2D) and
2.33a (3D), i.e., slightly more than two particle radii. In
the other limit of vanishing Brownian motion the aver-
age distance is of course zero. Further, a crossover in
the average distance of the dipole is expected roughly
at kBT /EC = 1. In colloidal sciences, the crossover be-
tween regions dominated by coulomb interaction on the
one hand and by thermal diﬀusion of particles on the
other hand is often determined by the Bjerrum length

lB =

q2
4πεε0kBT

.

(23)

On distances smaller than the Bjerrum length, interac-
tion of particles is guided by coulomb interaction, while
on larger distances diﬀusion dominates.
If all colloidal
particles carry identical charges, the suspension is sta-
bilized by Coulomb repulsion if the particle radii are
smaller than the Bjerrum length.

from a regime where it approaches the maximal value.
This allows one to estimate the typical dipole length, in
experiments as well as in simulations.

In reality, particles are not perfectly circular or spher-
ical. The roughness of the surface of a particle has the
qualitative implication that rotations become increas-
ingly diﬃcult with increasing roughness. As a conse-
quence, we expect a shift of the cross-over to lower ther-
mal energies.
In this sense, the oberserved point can
be considered as an upper limit for the range where the
Coulomb forces dominate.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The use of electrostatic forces strongly aﬀects the dy-
namics of agglomeration processes, for instance coating of
micrometer particles with nanometer particles. In par-
ticular, it is still an open question to what extent the
exact locations of charges on the particles have impact
on the resulting agglomerated structures. In this context
the subquestion arises whether recombination of two par-
ticles carrying opposite charge gives a pertaining dipole
or whether the charges cancel out. To simulate large sys-
tems of suspended charged particles, knowledge about
charge recombination allows for proper approximations,
which in turn may increase the range of many-particle
simulations.

A detailed study of two idealized situations have been
presented. First the case of one very large particle with
a target charge, which attracts a much smaller particle
with one oppsite charge. Formulating the problem in
terms of a Fokker-Planck equation, the stationary solu-
tion is found analytically in 2D and 3D. The ﬁndings are
supported by numerical simulations, and the key results
are as follows. Interpreted as a hitting probability distri-
bution, there is a ﬁnite fraction of charged particles that
exactly recombine with the target charge, giving rise to
a δ-peak in the distribution. This is valid in 2D as well
as in 3D, although the strength of the δ-peak is some-
what larger in 2D. However, in 3D there is an additional
contribution decaying like 1/2r, where r is the distance
from the target charge. This is the main diﬀerence be-
tween 2D and 3D, and it is the reason why superposition
of the solution is possible in 2D, but not in 3D. Further,
there is a constant background term in the probability
distribution whose physical reason lies in the diﬀusion of
the particles.

The values of the limits and the location of the cross-
over are veriﬁed by numerical experiments as shown in
Fig. 10. Experiments are performed for diﬀerently sized
particles and for diﬀerent charges in 2D. The data sets
collapse since only the ratio of the Coulomb energy and
the thermal energy is relevant. This universal curve
shows a cross-over, seperating a regime where the resid-
ual dipole moment increases lineary with thermal energy,

Numerics is performed to test the analytic results, and
to provide qualitative insight into the situation of hav-
ing more target charges in 3D, which from the point of
view of applications is very important. In this case the
superposition of a homogenous background plus a 1/2r
shoulder located around each ﬁxed charge ﬁts the numer-
ical data suprisingly well. Deviations from the superposi-
tion of single charge solutions are visible in an increasing

strength of delta peaks. Thus, an increased number of
ﬁxed charges increases the probability for a compensation
of ﬁxed charges and incoming particles.

The second idealized situation is the study of two par-
ticles of equal size recombining.
In this case the rota-
tional degree of freedom is included. From physical rea-
soning and from simulation, we demonstrate that there
is a cross-over when Coulomb energy equal to thermal
energy. Larger thermal energies means a regime where
dipoles are created with random distance. For lower ther-
mal energies the average length of the dipole goes to zero
in the limit, but for ﬁnite ratios of the energies, the aver-
age length increases rapidly with the energy ratio. This
implies that for simulations or experiments in this range,
the detailed localization of charges on the particles must
be taken into account for a correct description of the
physics.

with ~u=

touch the wall (cf. Sec. II B). Let us ﬁrst consider
the two-dimensional case in the x, z-plane, where the z-
axis denotes the direction perpendicular to the surface
of the grain (see Fig. 4). Introducing polar coordinates
z=r cos ϕ and x=r sin ϕ the gradient acting on a scalar

Far away from the target charge the probability dis-
tribution P (r, ϕ) will not be inﬂuenced by the Coulomb
force. Since it is assumed that particles are inserted ho-
mogenously at large distance, we therefore expect a linear
asymptotic behavior

Obviously this condition can only be satisﬁed for ω = 1.

ﬁnd B=0. Hence the solution of the two-dimensional
Fokker-Planck equation simply reads

APPENDIX C: FLUXLINES OF THE

Following the previous calculation, we solve the
Fokker-Planck equation (A1) by ﬁrst transforming it to
spherical coordinates

In two dimensions the trajectories of the vector
ﬁeld (A13) can be obtained by solving the diﬀerential
equation

x = r sin ϑ cos ϕ
y = r sin ϑ sin ϕ
z = r cos ϑ .

Q(ϑ, ϕ) = 0 (B4)

R(r) = 0 (B5)

As illustrated in Fig. 4 the system is invariant under ro-
tations around the z-axis. Thus, the solution will only
depend on r and ϑ, hence Q(ϑ, ϕ) = Q(ϑ).

Solving the angular equation, the general solution can
be expressed in terms of Legendre polynomials. However,
for large r we expect the solution to be independent of the
Coulomb ﬁeld, i.e., linear in z. Therefore, the only solu-
tion of the angular equation, which satisﬁes the boundary
condition Q(π/2) = 0, turns out to be Q(ϑ) = cos ϑ with
the eigenvalue
= 2. The corresponding radial equation

has the solution

Since P (r, ϑ, ϕ) has to be non-negative for small r the
second term has to vanish, i.e., B = 0. Choosing A = 1/2

In three dimensions the separatrix can be calculated in

ﬁeld (B8) obey the diﬀerential equation

The main quantity of interest, which can be calculated
from the probability density ﬂux, is the distribution of
the particles that hit the wall. Due to the rotational

symmetry of the conﬁguration around the charged parti-
cle, this density, ρ(r), is a function of the radial distance r
from the charge only. The density is equal to the normal
component of the ﬂux at the wall

ρ(r) =

jz(~r)

|z=0 .

(D1)

For all points on the wall, except for r=0, it follows by
direct insertion into Eqs. (A13) and (B8), that

ρ(r) =

In the 2D solution it is understood that the δ-function
integrated over the target line gives unity. Likewise in
3D, integration of the δ-function over the target plane
gives unity.

Introduction

It is under discussion to operate storage rings like HERA, RHIC, LHC with heavy ions. Because
of the heavily increased intrabeam scattering of heavy ions compared to protons, the achievable
luminosity of the rings is much smaller than desired by the experiments. A way to increase
luminosity could be cooling of the beams. Diﬀerent methods of cooling can be suggested. Among
them the electron and laser methods of cooling are the most eﬀective ones. Because of the
high electron energy necessary for electron cooling of heavy ions the conventional approach using
electrostatic DC sources is not possible. Instead an electron storage ring could be used. For this
ring there are special requirements like small damping times, emittances and energy spread. The
feasibility of such an electron storage ring was studied for HERA, and the results with a possible
solution are presented in papers [1], [2]. In this paper the laser cooling of nuclear beams in storage
rings is discussed. The main properties of nuclei with isomeric levels in the energy range E < 50
′ rad is less than some µs.
keV are considered when the isomer half-life in the fully stripped ion τ
There are no any other decay channels for low energy isomeric nuclei levels, excluding γ-radiation,
for naked nuclei. That is why, the isomer’s half life in a fully stripped ion coincides with the
radiation life time.

2 Fundamentals of laser cooling of ions in a storage ring

As a consequence of Liuville’s theorem, the compression of phase space density for a given ensemble
of particles requires a dissipative force. In the case of both simple and complicated particles such as
electrons, protons, heavier ions moving in the external ﬁelds such a force results from the radiative
friction. Friction force appears through synchrotron/undulator radiation of particles in the ﬁelds of

1

bending magnets, magnetic lenses, undulators or through backward Compton/Rayleigh scattering
of laser photons by simple/complicated charged particles. Below we will discuss the physics of
the backward Rayleigh scattering of laser photons on relativistic complicated ions/nuclears and
methods of the nuclear beam cooling based on such scattering [3] - [10].

2.1 The Rayleigh scattering of laser photons on relativistic ions

Let a laser beam is directed against and scattered by an ion beam. In general case the laser beam
is not monochromatic one. The central frequency of the incoming and scattered laser photons
in this case will be written as ωl
0 respectively. Since we are considering the case near
resonance, we have ωl
0 and ωs
ωl
0. Let ¯hωtr be the transition energy in the ion’s rest frame
between two electronic (not fully stripped ion) or nuclear (naked ion) states 1 and 2, and ¯hωl and
¯hωs be the corresponding energies of the incoming laser photons and the scattered photons in the
laboratory frame, respectively. These quantities are related by

Due to the Lorentz transformations in accordance with (2.2) low-energy laser photons from
the laboratory system are converted to much larger photon energies in the ion’s rest frame. Thus
highly charged ions become accessible to laser cooling.

2.2 Laser cooling of ion beams in storage rings

A typical version of laser cooling of ion beams in the longitudinal plane is based on the resonant
interaction of unbunched ion beam and homogeneous quasi-monochromatic laser beam overlapping
the ion one in the transverse direction. The initial central frequency of the laser beam is chosen

so that photons interact ﬁrst with the most high energy ions. Then the frequency is scanning in
the high frequency direction, and ions of a lower energy begin to interact with the laser beam and
decrease their energy. The scanning of the laser frequency is stopped when all ions are gathered
at the minimum energy of ions in the beam. The rate of the laser frequency scanning must
correspond to the condition ˙εr[ωl
0(t)] = dεr/dt < P s, where the resonance ion energy εr = Mc2γr,
γr = [1 + (ωtr/ωl

It depends only on the properties of the ion, laser photon energy and the relative energy spread
of the ion/nuclear beam.

Laser cooling of not fully stripped non-relativistic ion beams was used at the TSR ring in
Germany and ASTRID in Denmark [14] - [18]. This is one of possible cooling methods of ion
beams in the longitudinal plane.
Ions
in the direction of given resonance energy can be accelerated by eddy electric ﬁelds or by phase
displacement mechanism.

In other methods the laser frequency can be constant.

Bunched ion beams can be cooled in buckets by quasi-monochromatic laser beam with acceler-
ating ﬁelds of radiofrequency cavities [19]. The broadband laser beam with a sharp low frequency
edge can be used as well. In the last case the edge frequency must have such a value that only
ions with energies above the equilibrium one can be excited [20].

The considered one-dimensional laser cooling of ion beams is highly eﬃcient in the longitudinal
plane. A special longitudinal-radial coupling mechanisms such as synchro-betatron resonance
[21, 22, 4] or dispersion coupling [23, 24] can be added for ion cooling both in the longitudinal and
in the transverse planes. In papers [4] - [6] a conventional three-dimensional radiative ion cooling
method is proposed and developed. An eﬃcient enhanced method of cooling both in longitudinal
and transverse planes was suggested in papers [8], [9]. Unfortunately the damping times in the
three-dimensional method of cooling of naked ion beams are long and the enhanced method of ion
cooling in the transverse plane can be applied only to the not fully stripped ion beams if the level
decay length of ions is shorter then the length of betatron oscillations in the storage ring.

Fully stripped ions have very narrow nuclear levels and as the result very small average cross
sections. In this case ions crossing the laser beam of ﬁnite length in the interaction region will per-
ceive the monochromatic laser as a broadband one with the frequency band ∆ωl/ωl

The considered examples show that naked ion beams can be cooled in the longitudinal direction
for an acceptable damping time τε < 1 h using lasers of moderate power and high ﬁnesse open

can be used to cool the ions 201Hg, 151Sm, 171T m, 239P u, 169T m, 83Kr, 187Os in the future LHC
storage ring2. These ions have transition energies ¯hωtr < 10 eV. Almost all ions presented in the

Near the same parameters infrared FEL was realized by JAERI FEL group in Japan. This group
has planned the UV laser (¯hωl

estimated to be $55M in production. The energy of the electron beams of the superconducting

To cool nuclear beam in the transverse direction we can use longitudinal-radial coupling of
betatron and phase oscillations through the synchro-betatron resonance. In this case the cooling
time will be increased

2 times.

is limited to 1.064 µm, the fabrication technique is suﬃciently applicable to shorter wavelengths [28].

Notice, that excitation energies of electronic levels of not fully stripped ions are much lower
then nuclear ones. At the same time the scattering cross-section for electronic transitions is much
larger then for nuclear ones. That is why eﬀective laser cooling of both non relativistic and
relativistic not fully stripped ion beams can be realized in storage rings easily.

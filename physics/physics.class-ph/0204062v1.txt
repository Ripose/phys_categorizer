Abstract

In this work we revisit the process of constructing wave equations for the
scalar and vector potentials of an electromagnetic ﬁeld, and show that a
wave equation with an arbitrary velocity (including a velocity higher than
the velocity of light in vacuum) for the scalar potential exists in the frame-
work of classical electrodynamics. Some consequences of this fact are con-
sidered.

Our letter is devoted to the discussion of a possibility of the existence of sub- and

superluminal electromagnetic waves in vacuum.

A considerable number of experimental and theoretical works about superluminal

spreading of electromagnetic waves, particles and other objects have recently been pub-

lished, as mentioned by E. Recami in [1,2], Walker in [3], Kotel’nikov in [4,5] and in

the book edited by Chubykalo et al [6] (see also references in the mentioned works). J.

Marangos wrote in his brilliant note “Faster than a speeding photon” [7]: “The text-

books say nothing can travel faster than light, not even light itself. New experiments

show that is no longer true, raising questions about the maximum speed at which we can

send information.” (see also the bibliography in this work). Really, a series of recent ex-

periments, performed at Cologne[8], Berkeley[9], Florence[10] and Vienna[11], and quite

recent experiments by W. Tittel et al [12] revealed that evanescent waves (in undersized

waveguides, e.g.) seem to spread with a superluminal group velocity. For example, in

up-to-date experiments by Mugnai et al (see their work [13]) superluminal behavior in

the propagation of microwaves (centimeter wavelength) over much longer distances (tens

of centimeters) at a speed 7% faster than c was reported.

In the majority of cases, these works almost directly declare that generally accepted

electrodynamics must be suﬃciently reconsidered.1

In this paper we would like to address the problem of electromagnetic waves spreading

with an arbitrary velocity in vacuum (v ≤ c and v ≥ c) conditioned by a choice of

gauges. In other words, we attempt to explain here these superluminal electromagnetic

phenomena using well-known arbitrariness of a choice of gauges permitted by classical

Is there a way of showing a possibility of the existence of the superluminal wave pro-

cesses in vacuum mentioned in the beginning of the letter, without leaving the framework

of classical electrodynamics? Here we show that, yes, there is.

It is known, if we are given potentials A and ϕ, then these uniquely determine the

electrodynamics.

ﬁelds E and H:

E = −∇ϕ −

and

H = ∇ × A.

However, it is well known that the same ﬁeld can correspond to diﬀerent potentials.

Electric and magnetic ﬁelds determined from equations (1) actually do not change upon
replacement of A and ϕ by A′ and ϕ′, deﬁned by

A′ = A + ∇f

and

ϕ′ = ϕ −

(2)

.

Only those quantities which are invariant with respect to the transformation (2) have

physical meaning, so all equations must be invariant under this transformation.

This non-uniqueness of the potentials gives us the possibility of choosing them so that

they fulﬁll one auxiliary condition (gauge) chosen by us. It means that we can set one,

since we may choose the function f in (2) arbitrarily.

Let us recall how a necessity of choosing a gauge condition arises. One substitutes

ﬁelds E and H, expressing by potentials A and ϕ, into Maxwell equations

∇ · E = 4π̺,

∇ · H = 0,

∇ × H =

to obtain equations which are easier-to-use than the original equations with respect to

ﬁelds E and H. After direct substituting (1) into Maxwell equations we have:

Thus because of non-uniqueness of the potentials, we can always subject them to an

auxiliary condition. For this reason, we try to choose this condition so as the system of

equations (7) and (8) (or at least one of them) would be transformed into some “easy-

to-solve” equations. Let us consider this problem from a purely formal, mathematical
point of view. Note if a certain connection between div A and ∂ϕ

∂t exists then because of

dimensions condition this connection must generally look like

div A + α

= 0,

∂ϕ
∂t

where α is an arbitrary constant parameter with dimensions

. We will show that

the condition (9) can satisfy (2) by a corresponding choice of function f in (2). For this
we substitute values A′ and ϕ′ into (9):

Let us make now a formal conjecture that a perturbation of potential ϕ spreads with a

certain arbitrary constant velocity v (for a given process) which is not necessarily equal
to c. We choose the arbitrary constant α as α = c

v2 then the condition (9) becomes

.

Consequently from (10) we obtain the equation for f :

gauge (11)2.

The gauge (11) unlike the Lorentz gauge, has no relativistically invariant character.

But gauge (11) is obviously allowable in classical electrodynamics on parity with other

well-known gauges: the Coulomb gauge

div A = 0

and

∆ϕ = −4π̺

and the so-called radiation gauge

div A = 0

and

ϕ = 0,

which in turn also have no relativistically invariant character [15].

Let us apply the gauge (11) to Eqs. (7) and (8). As a result we obtain two equations:

In current- and charge-free regions these equations become

We can see that the equations obtained diﬀer strongly from the well-known wave

phase velocity3 v which can be both lower than c and higher than c (unlike the solution of

Eq.(19)!) Then there is Eq.(18) which is a wave equation with a source (unlike Eq.(20))

despite the fact that this equation is written for charge(current-)-free space. The function

of source in Eq.(18) is a gradient of changing of the solution of Eq.(17) with changing of

time. Note that the gauge (11) is more general gauge than Coulomb and Lorentz gauges.

Actually, if we choose the arbitrary constant velocity v in (11) as c we obtain the Lorentz

gauge and corresponding wave equations for potentials (19),(20), on the other hand if v

in (11) tends to inﬁnity we immediately obtain the Coulomb gauge and corresponding

equations for potentials:

(index C denotes that these potentials obey Coulomb gauge).

Obviously, equations (15)-(18) and specially Eqs.

(15) and (17) can lead the way

to found a theory of superluminal electromagnetic interactions and signal transfer in

vacuum, which experimental evidences were mentioned in the Introduction. And the

scalar potential ϕ from Eqs. (17) has to play the leading role in constructing this theory.

Against this, one can say that there is the well-known, generally accepted opinion

in classical electrodynamics that electromagnetic potentials are just auxiliary quantities

which have no real physical meaning (unlike real mensurable magnitudes E and H). We

can reply to this retort as follows:

On the one hand, from generally accepted classical electrodynamics we know that the

Poynting vector is proportional to the density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum. But

on the other hand, paradoxes connected with the Poynting vector (and, correspondingly,

with an energy and momentum distribution) exist and they are well-known. For example,

in [16] it is noted: if a point charge Q is vibrating in some mechanical way along the X-

axis with respect to a certain point xQ, then the value of electromagnetic energy density

3recall that in vacuum, the phase velocity and the group velocity of electromagnetic perturba-
tion spreading coincide.

6

w (which is a point function like E) on the same axis will be also oscillating. Immediately

the question arises: how does the test charge q at the point of observation, lying at some

ﬁxed distance from the point xQ along the continuation of the X-axis, “know” about the

charge Q vibration? In other words, we have a rather strange situation: the Poynting
4π [E × H] is zero along this axis4 (because H is zero along this line) but the
vector S = c
energy and the momentum, obviously “pass” from point to point along this axis. This

means that we cannot be sure any more that exclusively using the vector ﬁelds E and

H allows us to characterize the process of distributing the electromagnetic energy and

momentum in vacuum within the framework of classical electrodynamics.

It would be

very interesting to carry out thorough research in this problem. At this stage, we can

only say that it is unlikely that one can solve this problem without taking into account a

physical reality of electromagnetic potentials waves. On the other hand the equation (17)

and (18) are conjunct, i.e. the radiator (source) in the wave equation (18) for the vector

potential is the function of the superluminal (for example) solution of (17)! What does it

mean theoretically? It means that the source of the vector potential’s waves spreads with

an superluminal velocity. But the vector potential in turn produces the variable magnetic

ﬁeld (it follows from ∇ × A = H). The variable magnetic ﬁeld in turn produces the

variable electric ﬁeld. It means that a perturbation of the scalar potential started up in

some distant point reaches the given point and produces in it mensurable ﬁelds E and H.

It is an accepted truth that, for the purpose of long-range radio communications, one

employs mainly transverse electromagnetic waves propagating at the speed of light. These

waves are described mathematically by relatively simple equations whose consequences

can be easily veriﬁed by experiment. On the other hand, as it was noted in the recent work

[18], there exists an extensive area of electromagnetic phenomena characterized by a com-

plicated and mainly approximate mathematical formulation whose consequences cannot
be easily tested experimentally5. This is precisely the area where one can expect to ﬁnd

4Note that recently many works devoted to the Poynting vector concept was published. See,
e.g., [17] and corresponding references there.

transitions responsible for the emission of photons by atoms.

unknown eﬀects and unusual properties of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Such an expectation

is supported by the fact that even classical electrodynamics does not actually prohibit

either the superluminal velocity or the longitudinal electromagnetic waves if we take into

account the physical reality of potentials and existence of Eqs.

(15)-(18).

It is clear,

therefore, that in general electromagnetic ﬁelds may propagate in a manner drastically

diﬀerent from that with which we are familiar on the basis of radio broadcasting.

For objectiveness we have to mention that many works are published where authors

claim that the absolute majority of experiments discovered the superluminal propagation

are incorrect (see, for example, the book [6] the Section “Contra”). But we just would

like to note that it cannot be emphasized enough that in the problem of the experimental

conﬁrmation or confutation of the superluminal propagation the last word has not yet

been said on this matter. But now we have the formal proof, based only on Maxwell

electrodynamics, that electromagnetic waves connected with a perturbation of scalar po-

tential ϕ (Eqs. (15), (17)) can travel either faster than the speed of light in vacuum c or

slower than c but not exclusively with c exactly! Here let us observe (following E.Recami

[19]) that the particular role of the speed of light in the Special Relativity is due to its

invariance, and not to the fact that it is (or it is not) the maximal one.

Appendix 6

Recently, two works [20, 21] on the subject considered in this paper appeared, where

it is stated that despite of non-retarded origin of the scalar potential in any gauge (except

the Lorentz one), the E ﬁeld calculated in any gauge is retarded. To the authors’ point

of view, it is not so.

One can easily see that in both cited works 7, the key point of proof of equivalence of
the gauges is to show that the current density j can be presented as a sum of two currents,

longitudinal and transversal:

j|| + j⊥ = j

by the way, the longitudinal current, which is the source in the equation for the vector

potential, is yielded by the action-at-distant scalar potential so it is described by highly

nonlocal function (Eq. (3.9) of [21] and Eq. (2.8) of [20]).

Correspondingly, the transversal current is described by highly nonlocal function too:

j|| = −

1
4π

∇

Z

∇′ · j(r′, t)
|r − r′|

dr′

j⊥ =

∇ × ∇ ×

1
4π

j(r′, t)
|r − r′|

dr′

Z

∇ × ∇ × j = ∇(∇ · j) − ∇2j

Eqs. (24) and (25) correspond to Eqs. (6.49) and (6.50) of [22], where the proof that the

sum of rhs of these equations is equal to the rhs of Eq. (23) is given. This proof is based

on application of the vector identity

and equation ∇2(1/ |r − r′|) = −4πδ(r − r′) . However, it should be noted that while

proving validity of Eq. (23), (or Eq. (6.48) of [22]), two formal rules are broken here, i.e.

• In Eq.

(25) the diﬀerential operator ∇ × ∇× must act on the vector too but

1/ |r − r′| is a scalar,

• the diﬀerential operator ∇ × ∇× acts on external variable but the vector equality

(26) must be applied to internal variables.

So, the proof given in [22] is incorrect and, therefore, calculations of works [20, 21]

based on this proof are incorrect too.

7We focus on the Coulomb gauge as it is done in [20, 21], but basically it can be shown for any
gauge

9

Physical explanation of incorrectness of this proof is simple: original current density

is the local quantity. After Eq. (23), it is proposed to form the local quantity from two

nonlocal quantities. Let us consider a point of space where the current is zero. We should

create from this zero two vector ﬁelds; by the way one of them is rotational (Eq. 25)) and

second is irrotational (Eq. (24)), i.e. two ﬁelds diﬀerent in their origin. So the rotational

ﬁeld is equal to ’minus’ irrotational ﬁeld and, because for the vector the sign ”minus”

correspond to opposite direction of the vector, rotational ﬁeld = - irrotational ﬁeld, that

is nonsense.

The reader can see that we do not use Eq. (23) in our calculations and just in this

point, there is essential diﬀerence between this work and all previous works on the gauges

in the classical electrodynamics where correctness of Eq. (23) is undeniably accepted.

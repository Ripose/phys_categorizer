We study the behavior of clocks in 1+1 Minkowski spacetime assuming the relativity principle -
a frame moving uniformly with respect to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame -, the principle
of constancy of the speed of light - the velocity of light, ﬁnite or inﬁnite, is invariant under inertial
frame changes -, and the locality principle - acceleration does not aﬀect the rate of clocks. The set
of possible theories turns out to be larger than usually expected. This is due to the existence, in
the 1+1 case, of a one-dimensional non-trivial representation of the Lorentz group.

Besides the special relativistic and classical cases new theories parametrized by a real coeﬃcient

β appear. These alternative theories are, however, not invariant under parity symmetry.

The eﬀect of diﬀerential aging is studied for the diﬀerent values of β. In particular if |β| = 1/c the
eﬀect of diﬀerential aging is shown to vanish, leading to a relativistic theory for which it is possible
to deﬁne an absolute time. Below this critical value the diﬀerential aging has the usual direction
- after a round trip the accelerated observer returns younger than the twin at rest in the inertial
frame - while above the critical value the diﬀerential aging reverses its direction. A nice formal
correspondence with thermodynamics is also shown to arise in the non-relativistic case.

Finally, these ﬁndings are shown to provide a means for determining the spacetime positioning of

non-inertial observers.

INTRODUCTION

β = ±1/c the diﬀerential aging changes sign.

Since their discovery the Lorentz transformations have
been derived in many ways5,16,18,19,31. The goal was es-
sentially that of reducing the number of postulates mak-
ing them logically and physically independent. Some au-
thors recognized the need of an isotropy assumptions in
the derivation2,17,20,29. We shall show that in the special
1+1-dimensional case if no parity symmetry assumption
is made, the physics compatible with the usual principles
of special relativity becomes richer. The reason is the
existence in 1+1 dimensions of the Lorentz group repre-
sentation Λ → eβθ where θ is the rapidity and β is an
arbitrary constant. In this way one can consider eβθΛ as
the coordinate transformation that relates diﬀerent in-
ertial frames. For higher dimensions no one-dimensional
non-trivial representation exists and the usual special rel-
ativistic physics (β = 0) is recovered. The ultimate task
is to study the behavior of clocks in the corresponding
generalized theories showing an interesting phenomenon
that may occur varying the value of β: the diﬀerential
aging reversal.

Consider the clock problem of special relativity where
an accelerated observer makes a round-trip with respect
to an inertial observer. Their clocks previously synchro-
nized are compared at the end of the trip. The diﬀer-
ential aging is the diﬀerence between the proper time of
the clock at rest in the inertial frame and the proper
time of the accelerating clock at the ﬁnal meeting event.
Special relativity predicts that the diﬀerential aging has
always a positive sign independently of the arbitrary mo-
tion performed during the round-trip by the non-inertial
observer. A similar result will be proved below for any
given β with the diﬀerence that when β crosses the values

The study of clocks in accelerated reference frames has
attracted the attention of many writers. A good review
with a bibliography with old papers can be found for in-
stance in27.
In most of those works the authors tried
to generalize the Lorentz transformation to include ac-
celerating reference frames, a procedure that has how-
ever some disadvantages. The coordinates (t, x) of an
accelerating frame were usually required to represent the
outcome of spacetime measurements made in the frame
with standard rods and clocks. The lines x = cnst.,
however, represent the worldlines of points at rest in the
accelerating frame and as such depend on some rigid-
ity assumptions that may change depending on the con-
vention adopted by the author25,27,28. Due to the con-
straints imposed by the rigidity assumptions and due to
the complicated calculations involved in the coordinate
formalism, most authors studied only the simple case of
uniform acceleration.

Another approach that does not impose rigidity as-
sumptions but still makes use of transformations between
inertial and homogeneous accelerating frames was con-
sidered by Hill11,12 and others4,6,7,14,15,26. There the
Lorentz group is enlarged to the group of conformal
transformation where the additional generators provide
the link between inertial and non-inertial frames. Hill13
considered also the clock problem ﬁnding that according
to the conformal theory there are only two solutions both
of vanishing diﬀerential aging. Although in contrast both
with special relativity and with observations1,9,10,30 this
result is interesting to us since it may be shown to cor-
respond to the case β = ±1/c in our notation. Hill was
able to show that with these critical values there is no
diﬀerential aging although he proved this result only in

the case of a uniformly accelerating non-inertial frame.
Hill also recognized that those solutions violated the par-
ity symmetry, a feature shared by all choices β 6= 0 in our
case. Here we prove the same null diﬀerential aging re-
sult for arbitrary motions of the non-inertial frame and
show that those values of β are in fact transitions values:
It is
the diﬀerential aging crossing them changes sign.
important to stress that since we prove the absence of
diﬀerential aging for β = ±1/c and for arbitrary non-
inertial motions it follows that in those cases an absolute
time can be constructed using the transport of clocks.

Since we focus our study on the behavior of moving
clocks it is much more convenient to use only inertial
frames, avoid exotic deﬁnitions of non-inertial coordi-
nates or coordinate transformations, and make contact
with the measurements of accelerating clocks by using
the locality principle: acceleration does not aﬀect the
rate of clocks.

In this work we ﬁrst show the relevance, for the behav-
ior of clocks, of a constant factor in front of the Lorentz
transformations and then, introduced the coeﬃcient β,
we consider the clock problem in the generalized theo-
ries. The diﬀerential aging is calculated using a formula
that gives it in terms of the arbitrary acceleration of the
non-inertial frame. Then using Holder’s inequality the
diﬀerential aging sign is determined for diﬀerent values
of β. Finally, it is shown how to reproduce in practice
the behavior of clocks of theories with β 6= 0 and how
this could be useful for the spacetime positioning of the
non-inertial observer.

II. THE LOCALITY PRINCIPLE OF SPECIAL
RELATIVITY

Consider a spacetime M = E1 × R where E1 is a Eu-
clidean 1-dimensional space of coordinate x, and t ∈ R
is a time variable. The previous splitting is associated
to an inertial frame, the coordinate t is the time of the
inertial frame or Einstein time i.e. the time measured
by a clock at rest in the frame origin, extended over the
entire spacetime by means of the Einstein synchroniza-
tion convention24. By inertial frame we mean a frame
where no apparent forces are present, that is, in an iner-
tial frame free particles move along straight lines.

In the following we shall assume the ﬁrst and sec-
ond principle of special relativity in a slightly generalized
form

• First principle. A frame moving uniformly with
respect to an inertial frame is also an inertial frame.

• Second principle. The velocity of light c, ﬁnite or
inﬁnite, is invariant under inertial frame changes.

Here the second principle is generalized to include the
case of inﬁnite light speed.
In this way Galilean and
Einsteinian relativity will be considered as two particular
cases of the principle of constancy of the speed of light,

2

(2)

the former if c = +∞ the latter if 0 < c < +∞. We are
not trying to reduce the number of basic principles and
for this reason, apart from this slight generalization, we
adopt here one of the more traditional choices.

In this work we shall be mainly concerned with the
behavior of clocks moving in M . Given a trajectory
γ(λ) : [0, 1] → M we want to associate to it a natural
parametrization T (λ) that aims at reproducing the ac-
tual time measured by a clock moving along the same
trajectory at the event (t, x)(λ). We shall refer to it as
the natural time. Consider two arbitrary timelike trajec-
tories (that is v = dx
dt < c) γ1 and γ2 having the same
endpoints. Consider two clocks C1 and C2 moving re-
spectively on γ1 and γ2 and synchronized at the ﬁrst
endpoint. We shall say that the physical theory con-
sidered admits an absolute time if the two clocks arrive
still synchronized at the second endpoint. This time is
deﬁned keeping ﬁxed the ﬁrst endpoint and giving to it
the value of the time measured by the transported clock
in the ﬁnal endpoint. As we shall see, an absolute time
should not necessarily coincide with the Einstein time t
of a particular inertial frame. The usual candidates for
T are

• Absolute time of classical physics,

T = t,

• Proper time of special relativity,

T = τ =

1 − v2/c2dt,

Zγ

p
where we have denoted v = ˙x = dx/dt. Experiments
have established that massive particles cannot move
faster than light and that the natural time is given by
proper time. These experiments may be considered as
tests of the locality principle for clocks measurements.
Roughly speaking the locality principle states that
measurements performed in an accelerating frame of ref-
erence give the same results of measurements performed
in the local inertial frame, that is, in a frame that has
instantaneously the same velocity of the original frame
but zero acceleration. This principle applies to some
measurements that can be performed in an arbitrarily
small natural time in such a way that the non-inertial
frame velocity does not change signiﬁcatively during the
measurement. However, it does not apply to every kind
of measurements, for instance, an accelerometer would
give diﬀerent measurements in the two frames. For a
discussion on the limits of this principle see21,22. In the
case of natural time measurements the locality principle
may be stated in the following more rigorous way.

Locality principle. Let Cn, n ∈ N of natural times
Tn be clocks constructed in the same region of E1 with
the same procedure, and let them be separated along
worldlines γn(Tn), where the natural time has been used
to parametrize the curves. Let γn, n ≥ 1 intersect γ0 at

γn−1

γ0

γn

γn+1

FIG. 1: The locality principle. As the straight geodesics
tend to be tangent to the accelerated curve, the inertial time
elapsed between the intersections tends to the time elapsed in
the accelerated frame between the same intersections.

two events γ0( ¯T0n) = γn( ¯Tn) and γ0( ˆT0n) = γn( ˆTn) with
ˆTn > ¯Tn, and for all n ≥ 1 let vn(Tn) be a constant in an
open set Un such that [ ¯Tn, ˆTn] ∈ Un. Then the locality
principle holds if under the conditions above

lim
ˆT0n− ¯T0n→0

ˆTn − ¯Tn
ˆT0n − ¯T0n

= 1

(3)

Figure 1 helps clarifying this deﬁnition.
The clock C0 is the accelerated clock. On the contrary
the clock Cn, n ≥ 1 is at rest in a suitable inertial frame
Kn for all the times in Un. The crucial point is that the
natural times ˆTn and ¯Tn are measurable thus, in prin-
ciple, it is possible to experimentally check whether the
locality principle holds for time measurements. In this
sense the word principle is somewhat ambiguous as it
could led to think that it is fundamental but conventional
in some measure. Romain27 for instance adopted this
point of view stating that the assumption of this princi-
ple “is, essentially, a matter of convenience and rests on
no compelling physical grounds”. At the time, however,
there were only few tests of the locality principle30. To-
day we have clear evidence that the proper time formula
is the correct formula for natural time1,9. Since it can be
deduced (in a spacetime of more than 2 dimensions, as
we shall see) from the principles of special relativity and
the locality principle these experiments are ultimately
indirect tests of the locality principle.

It is important to notice that in case of absolute time
the locality principle is automatically satisﬁed, indeed in
this case

If the locality principle holds then

where the last integral is the sum of the inﬁnitesimal time
intervals as measured by the local inertial clocks.

The natural time parametrization follows once we re-
late the Einstein times of two diﬀerent inertial frames.
This is done using the principle of constancy of the speed
of light and the relativity principle.

III. DERIVATION OF THE GROUP OF
COORDINATE TRANSFORMATIONS

From the constancy of the speed of light in diﬀerent
frames one ﬁnds how to relate the coordinates of the split-
ting M = E1 × R for diﬀerent inertial frames. The con-
stancy condition states that the light cone preserves the
same structure, i.e. c2∆t2−∆x2 = 0 iﬀ c2∆t′2−∆x′2 = 0.
The coordinates (t, x) and (t′, x′) provide two diﬀerent
charts on M . Consider the metrics ds2 = c2dt2 − dx2
and ds′2 = c2dt′2 − dx′2. The condition above states
that the null cones of these two metric coincide. Since
every vector at p ∈ M is a linear combination α1n1+α2n2
of two given null vectors n1 and n2 at p, the metrics at
p are completely determined by the scalars ds2(n1, n2)
and ds′2(n1, n2) respectively. This implies that the met-
rics ds2 and ds′2 are conformally related

c2dt′2 − dx′2 = Ω2

K ′K(x)[c2dt2 − dx2].

(5)

In the 1+1 case the transformation between the un-
primed and primed coordinates can be non-linear. For
instance introducing u± = ct ± x one has the set of
transformations u′± = f ±(u±) for arbitrary functions
f ±. However, if the dimension is increased to 2+1 or 3+1
the set of possible conformal transformation is reduced.
From a general theorem by Liouville3,8 the most general
νxν where Λ is
non-singular transformation is x′µ = ΩΛµ
a Lorentz transformation, x0 = ct and the constant Ω > 0
induces a dilation. The same result can be obtained in
two dimensions using the relativity principle.
Indeed,
by the deﬁnition of inertial frame, the transformation
should send straight lines to straight lines or geodesics to
geodesics. As it is well known, this is the case only if the
conformal factor is a constant. Thus in the previous for-
mula Ω2
K ′K is a constant and the transformation between
inertial frames is therefore given by x′µ = ΩK ′KΛµ

νxν .

Apparently we have derived here the Lorentz transfor-
mation in the usual way and therefore no new physical
content should appear. We shall see, however, that the
degree of freedom represented by the constant ΩK ′K gives
rise to some interesting consequences.

Note that in the Galilean, c → +∞, case Eq. (5) has

ˆTn − ¯Tn
ˆT0n − ¯T0n

= 1,

(4)

the limit

since ˆTn = ˆT0n and ¯Tn = ¯T0n.

dt′ = ΩK ′Kdt.

Finally, if the locality and the relativity principles hold

ln Ω12 = − ln Ω21.

It means that simultaneity is absolute, that is invariant
under change of inertial frame. As we shall see this does
not mean that time is absolute.

Let us now consider an accelerating clock and let K ′
be the local inertial frame. Since the clock is at rest
in the origin of the primed inertial frame K ′ we have
that the position of the clock is instantaneously given by
x′ = 0. Now, recall that t′ is deﬁned by means of a clock
at rest in the origin and by the locality principle it must
be dTK ′ = dt′. We have

dTK ′ = ΩK ′K(1 − v2/c2)1/2dt.

or

T =

ΩK ′(t)K(1 − v2)1/2dt.

(6)

Zγ

Here, ΩK ′(t)K is changing in time since the local inertial
frame with respect to which the clock lies in the origin
is changing too.

Remark. It may be tempting to consider the inclusion
of dilations in the transformation between inertial frames
as unphysical. Indeed one could maintain that dilations
arise merely from units changes. If the primed frame K ′
uses diﬀerent units, for instance inches in places of me-
ters it is natural that a dilation arises. However, this
transformation disappears if both frames use the same
units. Thus, it seems that dilations should not be in-
cluded if one assumes that all the inertial frames use the
same units.

The problem here is that we are explicitly saying that
clocks (and rods) have been produced in the same space-
time region following a well deﬁned procedure. They were
ticking at the same rate (they were syntonized) and syn-
chronized before they were accelerated to diﬀerent iner-
tial frames. As such, they tick by deﬁnition the same
unit of measure. Moreover, if two of such clocks meet
again, being at rest in a new inertial frame, they ﬁnd
synthonized by the locality principle from which Eq. (6)
has been derived, although they could be no more syn-
chronized. Since they tick the same whenever they meet
in the same inertial frame it is coherent to assume, by
deﬁnition, that the units were the same when the clock
were apart. We conclude that the conformal dilation con-
sidered here cannot be derived from a units change. It
has physical consequences in the way clocks that have
been separated turn out to be desynchronized.

IV. A STUDY OF ΩK′ (t)K

At this stage the usual task would be to prove that
the special relativistic formula T = τ follows from the
locality and the relativity principles. In order to reach
this result we have to prove that the relativity and the
locality principle imply ΩK(t) = 1. However, we shall
eventually see that this is not necessarily the case in 1+1
dimensions.

(8)

(9)

Consider Eq.

(5) with respect to the three pairs of
inertial frames K1-K2, K2-K3 and K1-K3. The compat-
ibility implies

Ω13 = Ω12Ω23,

ln Ω13 = ln Ω12 + ln Ω23,

while, considering K1-K2 and K2-K1, we obtain Ω12 =
Ω−1

21 or

It is well known that in standard SR the velocity of the
origin of K2 with respect to K1 is the opposite of the ve-
locity of the origin of K1 with respect to K2, v12 = −v21.
Here, although the transformation between the frames is
subject to a dilation, this relation still holds. The rea-
son is that the relative velocity in a ratio of coordinates
v = dx/dt and thus does not change under dilations. For
the same reason the addition of velocity rule

v13 =

v12 + v23
1 + v12v23/c2

(10)

remains the same in the present context as in standard
SR. The one parameter group of Lorentz transformation
in 1+1 dimensions is additive with respect to the rapid-
ity parameter θ such that v/c = tanh θ/c. In our con-
vention θ has the dimension of a velocity. In this way
we obtain the right limit θ = v in if c → ∞, which is
particularly convenient as v is an additive parameter in
non-relativistic physics. Let f = f (θ) be another param-
eter with the same additive property. Taking the limit
∆θ → 0 of the relation

f (θ + ∆θ) = f (θ) + f (∆θ)

we ﬁnd f ′(θ) = f ′(0) and therefore f = βθ with β ∈ R −
{0}. Thus any other parameter that shares the additivity
property should be proportional to the rapidity. Since
ln Ω12 shares this property we conclude

where β is a universal constant of dimensions [T ][L]−1
that does not charge changing the pair of inertial frames.
Since

Ω12 = eβθ12

eθ/c =

ﬁcients the usual formulas for proper time and absolute

Equation (11) is not invariant under reﬂections x(t) →
−x(t) thus a clock behaves diﬀerently depending on the
direction of motion at least if we are not in the special
relativistic or classical case where β = 0. This will be
a general feature in what follows. If one adds a parity
symmetry principle to the relativity principle and the
locality principle then the usual special relativity or clas-
sical physics is obtained. If this hypothesis is removed
introducing, for instance, a small but non vanishing β,
then alternatives theories for the behavior of clocks are
obtained.

V. THE TIME DILATION-ACCELERATION
FORMULA

In this section we consider two clocks. The clock C0 is
at rest in the origin of an inertial frame K while the clock
C1 intersects C0’s worldline at two events. For semplicity
assume that the two clocks have been synchronized at the
ﬁrst meeting point in such a way that t = T = 0, and
let ¯T be C1’s natural time at the second meeting point.
We are going to determine the diﬀerential aging t( ¯T ) − ¯T
starting from C1’s acceleration a(T ) during the journey.
From the diﬀerential relation between dt and dT we ﬁnd

x(T ) =

e−βθ(T

that is the worldline is timelike i.e. its tangent vector is
contained in the future light cone. The previous formula
can also be written

dτ = e−βθ(T )dT,

(16)

which gives a relation between natural time and proper
time.
In particular natural time coincides with proper
time only if β = 0 or the acceleration vanishes.

Consider an inﬁnitesimal boost ∆θ. With respect to
the local inertial frame K ′ where it takes place ∆θ = ∆v

it follows ¯T ≤ t( ¯T ). If f is not proportional to f −1 the
inequality is strict, which means that it is strict unless
a(T ) = 0, that is unless C1 and C0 follow the same tra-
jectory for T ∈ [0, ¯T ].

2. The case |β| = 1/c.

In this case from Eq. (19) we ﬁnd

t( ¯T ) = ¯T ,

(22)

thus the round-trip inertial time coincides with natural
time exactly as in the classical case. This results implies
that the relativistic |β| = 1/c theory has the same
clock behavior of the non-relativistic β = 0 theory
(classical theory).
Indeed, consider two clocks C1 and
C2 whose worldlines intersect at an event where they are
synchronized. If they meet again at a later event then
they will ﬁnd again synchronized. The reason is that
there is always a timelike geodesics connecting the two
events and thus an inertial frame with respect to which
the two motions are seen as round-trips. With respect

6

to that frame we can apply the previous formula and
ﬁnd ¯T1 = t1( ¯T1) = t2( ¯T2) = ¯T2. Here with ti we mean
the function t( ¯T ) constructed with the acceleration of
clock Ci. This result means the following

Remark. The classical theory and the relativistic
theories with |β| = 1/c admit an absolute time (see
section II).

Thus experiments involving comparisons of clock read-
ings can not distinguish between these theories. They can
be distinguished with experiments involving light.

The remark seems at ﬁrst sight in contradiction with
the fact that Einstein simultaneity is relative to the in-
ertial frame in the relativistic case. The point is that
it is indeed possible to construct an absolute time using
the transport of clocks but this time does not coincide
with the time obtained using the Einstein synchroniza-
tion convention. The Einstein simultaneity slices change
from frame to frame but the absolute time slices do not.
The global time constructed with the transport of clocks
can be found summing and subtracting Eqs. (14) and
(15). This absolute time is t + sgn(β)x/c and therefore it
has null simultaneity slices (lightlike simultaneity). This
is in any case a good simultaneity deﬁnition as timelike
particles move forward with respect to the absolute time.
The absolute time t + sgn(β)x/c is a Lorentz invariant

transformation for β 6= 0

non-relativistic limit

which are particular cases of Holder’s inequality. These
inequalities are strict unless g is a constant in which case
a(T ) = 0 in [0, ¯T ]. Plugging these in Eq. (28) we obtain
t( ¯T ) < ¯T unless the acceleration vanishes in the interval
in which case t( ¯T ) = ¯T and hence C1 is at rest in K.

B. The non-relativistic case

In the limit c → +∞, whatever the value of β 6= 0,
we have |β| > 1/c thus we can suspect that in the non-
relativistic case t( ¯T ) < ¯T . However, this argument does
not prove that in the limit it can not be t( ¯T ) = ¯T . In
order to obtain this result we have to take the c → +∞
limit of Eq. (19). As we shall see a nice formal corre-
spondence with thermodynamics arises.

Let E(T ) =

Equation (31) shows that in the classical case (β = 0)
there is no diﬀerential aging. We prove here that in the
non-relativistic (c = +∞) case if β 6= 0 there is always
diﬀerential aging in the unusual direction, t( ¯T ) < ¯T un-
less C0’s and C1’s trajectories coincide in T ∈ [0, ¯T ].

Since its derivative, if diﬀerent from zero, is negative for
positive β and positive for negative β, S has a maximum
at β = 0 where S = 0 since t = ¯T at that value. We con-
clude that if ˜β 6= 0 then S( ˜β) < 0 unless (∂S/∂β)(β) = 0
for all β ∈ [0, ˜β]. In this last case, however, (∆E)2 = 0,
that is E(T ) is a constant and therefore there is no ac-
celeration. This completes the proof.

VI. CHANGE OF RATE AND SPACETIME
POSITIONING

In section II we have clariﬁed that the sentence “the
rate of a clock does not change when the clock frame
accelerates” can summarize the content of the locality
principle. In this case the times compared are that of a
clock at rest in an inertial frame and that of an acceler-
ating clock. Both kind of times are natural times.

We can also use the expression “change of rate” when
referring to two parametrization of the same timelike
worldline. In this case, however, one of the parametriza-
tion should be diﬀerent from natural time, otherwise they
would coincide.
In this section we give a deﬁnition of
change of rate comparing in particular natural time and
proper time in our model.

T = 1

T = 3

T = 5

T = 6

FIG. 2: The behavior of clocks in theories with β 6= 0 can be
reproduced changing the rate of the special relativistic clocks
(β = 0). In this ﬁgure the straight lines represent local inertial
times. The natural time T of a β 6= 0 theory moves between
the lines starting from the upper-left corner. From Eq. (44)
it follows that the change of rate associated to this ﬁgure is
C(T ) = (ln 3)δ(T − 1) + (ln 2)δ(T − 3) − (ln 3)δ(T − 5) +
(ln 2)δ(T − 6).

Suppose, therefore, that we have two parametrizations
t and t′ of the same timelike worldline x(t) with t = f (t′)
a monotone function. We may consider t and t′ as the
times displayed by some t-clock or t′-clock. A t-clock,
however, really exists only if t is the natural time.

0 is given by ˜t = a(t′−t′

Let us consider ﬁrst the case t = at′ + b that can be
rewritten t = a(t′ + b/a). This equation states that the
two times would coincide after a resynchronization of the
t′-clock by a quantity b/a and a resyntonization (change
of scale) by a factor a. We shall refer to a as the rate of t
with respect to t′. Let us come to a generic dependence
t = f (t′) and consider a third time parametrization that
0)+t0 with a = dt/dt′(t′
for t′ > t′
0)
and t0 = f (t′
0). This time will be called the local inertial
time at time t′
0 for reasons that will be clear in what
follows.
It represents what would be the parameter t
with respect to t′ if t would no longer change rate for
0. Notice that the rate of t with respect to ˜t is
t′ > t′
1 at t = ˜t = t0.
In other words dt/d˜t(t0) = 1. Now,
the idea is that the change of rate C(t) of t with respect
to t′ should be deﬁned with respect to the local inertial
time. In this way the deﬁnition becomes independent of
the scale of t′ with which we started, i.e. C is invariant
under t′ → λt′. Let therefore be

C(t0) =

with the equation above.
If C(t) = 0 for t > t0 the
parametrization t coincides with the local inertial time ˜t
(see ﬁgures 2 and 3).

Eq. (16) has exactly this form with t = T and t′ = τ
thus we can say that with respect to proper time the nat-
ural time has a change of rate proportional to the ac-
celeration, C(T ) = βa(T ). The condition C(T ) = 0 is
equivalent to the condition a(T ) = 0 and this explains
why we called local inertial time the time t in this case.
The fact that for β = 1/c the diﬀerential aging vanishes
and there is an absolute time can be expressed with “if
the change of rate of natural time with respect to proper
time is 1
c a, the diﬀerential aging of special relativity is
completely cancelled and the transport of clocks deﬁnes
an absolute time”.

This may helpful as the absolute time t + sgn(β)x/c
may be reproduced from ordinary clocks (that measure
proper time) by suitably changing their rate (or scale) in
accordance with the acceleration. Imagine a clock pro-
vided with a button. The button changes the rate of the
clock taking as reference the rate before the button was
pressed, the new rate being proportional to the force ap-
plied to the button. Suppose this force is an apparent
force due the apparent acceleration of the clock, then the
behavior of the clock will reproduce one of the theories
considered here with β 6= 0, β being connected to the
response of the changing of rate mechanism to the ap-
parent pressure. If this mechanism is suitably regulated,
β = ±1/c, and therefore the clock would give the abso-
lute time t + sgn(β)x/c. Consider a non-inertial observer
provided with two such clocks. The clock with β = −1/c
is nothing but the clock with β = 1/c rotated of 180 de-
grees as the apparent acceleration in this way works in
the opposite direction; thus only clocks of the last kind
should be produced. Notice that the observer should not
press the buttons during the trip as the apparent force
would do automatically the job. At proper time τ the
non-inertial observer would be able to obtain, averaging
the readings of the clocks, the inertial time t and anal-
ogously, taking half the diﬀerence of the readings and
multiplying by c, the inertial position x. All this with
no need of external references (which means no need of
interchanging light signal with inertial observers). We
conclude that these clocks having a rate sensible to the
acceleration would provide a versatile spacetime position-
ing system.

There is a ﬁnal subtle point that requires some discus-
sion. We have said that clocks modiﬁed to change their
rate according to the acceleration would reproduce, suit-
ably regulated, the behavior of clocks of theories with
β 6= 0 and in particular those with |β| = 1/c thus mea-
suring the absolute time t + sgn(β)x/c. However, we
have also said that in the theories with |β| = 1/c that
linear combination is a Lorentz invariant while it is not
an invariant in special relativity. Thus, if the clock sensi-
ble to the acceleration reproduces the linear combination
t+sgn(β)x/c, it is natural to ask relative to which inertial
frame are those variables t and x referred. The answer is

eβ θ

T

FIG. 3: In order to reproduce the behavior of a clock for a
theory with β 6= 0 the change of rate must be related to the
T
acceleration by C(T ) = βa(T ). Thus βθ(T ) =
0 C(t)dt +
βθ(0). This ﬁgure shows exp[βθ(T )] for the change of rate
given by Figure 2 assuming θ(0) = 0.

R

that they are the variables of the inertial frame instan-
taneously at rest with the clock when it starts behaving
as in the theories with |β| = 1/c. It follows from the fact
that only in that frame we have at that instant dT = dt
and ˙x = 0 and thus that dT = d(t + sgn(β)x/c) at that
instant.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the behavior of clock in 1+1 dimen-
sional Minkowski spacetime assuming (a) the relativity
principle (b) the principle of constancy of the speed of
light (c) the locality principle. We have not imposed a
parity symmetry assumption or an equivalent isotropy as-
sumption. The set of physical theories has been shown to
depend on two parameters (i) the speed of light c and (ii)

9

the constant β such that the coordinate transformation
between inertial frames takes the form x′µ = eβθΛµ
νxν
where θ = c tanh−1(v/c) is the rapidity and v is the rel-
ative velocity of the frames. We have shown that for a
given β 6= 0 the diﬀerential aging has a sign that does
not depend on the arbitrary motion of the accelerated
frame. This result has been obtained applying Holder’s
inequality to a generalized time dilation-acceleration for-
mula. Moreover, we have proved that the sign changes
crossing the critical values β = ±1/c for which the dif-
ferential aging vanishes. At these values the transport
of clocks deﬁnes a global time variable or absolute time
t + sgn(β)x/c. The non-relativistic limit has also been
considered showing that for β 6= 0 a formal correspon-
dence with thermodynamics arises where β plays the role
of an inverse temperature. It is yet unclear whether this
correspondence hides some other physical meaning. Fi-
nally, in the last section, we have deﬁned the change of
rate showing that natural time has a change of rate with
respect to proper time proportional to the acceleration
through the constant β. This result has been used to
show the practical relevance of our ﬁndings: clocks can
be suitably constructed that behave as in the theories
with β = ±1/c. It is only necessary to make their rate
sensible to the acceleration. These clocks can be used to
ﬁnd the spacetime positioning of a non-inertial observer
with no need of external references.

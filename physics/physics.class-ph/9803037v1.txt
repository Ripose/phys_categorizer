Abstract

We considered the electromagnetic ﬁeld of a charge moving with a con-
stant acceleration along an axis. We found that this ﬁeld obtained from the
Li´enard-Wiechert potentials does not satisfy Maxwell equations if one con-
siders exclusively a retarded interaction (i.e. pure implicit dependence this
ﬁeld on time). We show that if and only if one takes into account both re-
tarded interaction and direct interaction (so called “action-at-a-distance”)
the ﬁeld produced by an accelerated charge satisﬁes Maxwell equations.

1. Introduction

The problem of a calculation of the potentials and the ﬁelds created by a point charge

moving with an acceleration was raised for the ﬁrst time about 100 years ago by A.Li´enard

and E.Wiechert [1] and has not lost relevance nowadays. The question concerning the

choice of a correct way to obtain these ﬁelds - seems to have been solved ﬁnally (see,

e.g. well-known book by L.D.Landau [2]). But lately many authors (see e.g.

[3-6] and

others in References, and this list one could continue) have time and again resorted to this

problem - a problem which was given up by contemporary physics long ago. We think

that there must be something behind it that makes the problem still actual from both

the scientiﬁc and pedagogical points of view.

It is well-known that the electromagnetic ﬁeld created by an arbitrarily moving charge

The notation {...}t0 means that all functions of x, y, z, t into the parenthesis {} are taken
at the moment of time t0(x, y, z, t) [2] (the instant t0 is determined from the condition

(8), see below).

Usually, the ﬁrst terms of the right-hand sides (rhs) of (1) and (2) are called “velocity

ﬁelds” and the second ones are called “acceleration ﬁelds”.

It was recently claimed by E.Comay [7] that “... Acceleration ﬁelds by themselves do

not satisfy Maxwell’s equations [8]. Only the sum of velocity ﬁelds and acceleration ﬁelds

satisﬁes Maxwell’s equations.” We wish to argue that this sum does not satisfy Maxwell’s

equations

in the case when one takes into consideration exclusively a retarded interaction.

The remainder of our paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we derive the ﬁelds E

and B taking into account exclusively the implicit dependence the potentials ϕ and A on

time t. In Section 3 we prove that the ﬁeld obtained from the Li´enard-Wiechert potentials

does not satisfy Maxwell equations if one considers exclusively a retarded interaction (in

the other words, the implicit dependence the potentials on time of observation t only). In

Section 4 we consider another way to obtain the ﬁelds E and B. This way is based on a

diﬀerent type of calculation of the derivatives ∂{}/∂t and ∂{}/∂xi in which the functions

ϕ and A are considered as functions with a double dependence on (t, x, y, z): implicit and

explicit simultaneously. By this way one obtains formally the same expressions (1) and

(2) for the ﬁelds. If one uses this manner to verify the validity of Maxwell’s equations,

one ﬁnds that ﬁelds (1) and (2) satisfy these equations. In this Section we shall show that

this way does not correspond to a pure retarded interaction between the charge and the

point of observation. Section 5 closes the paper.

2. Deriving the ﬁelds E and B taking into account the retarded interaction

only

Let us try to derive the formulas (1), (2) for the electric (E) and magnetic (B) ﬁelds

taking into account that the state of the ﬁelds E and B at the instant t must be completely

determined by the state of the charge at the instant t0. The instant t0 is determined from

the condition (see Eq.(63.1) of Ref.[2]):

t0 = t − τ = t −

R(t0)
c

.

(8)

Here τ = R(t0)/c is the so called “retarded time”, R = |R|, R is the vector connecting the

site r0(x0, y0, z0) of the charge q at the instant t0 with the point of observation r(x, y, z).

3

All the quantities on the rhs of (3) must be evaluated at the time t0 (see [2], the text

after Eq.(63.5)), which, in turn, depends on x, y, z, t:

t0 = f (x, y, z, t).

(9)

Let us, to be more speciﬁc, turn to Landau and Lifshitz who write ([2], p.161)1:

“To calculate the intensities of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds from the formulas

E = −∇ϕ −

B = [∇ × A].

(10)

1

we must diﬀerentiate ϕ and A with respect to the coordinates x, y, z of the point, and

the time t of observation. But the formulas (3) express the potentials as a functions of

t0, and only through the relation (8) as implicit functions of x, y, z, t. Therefore to

calculate the required derivatives we must ﬁrst calculate the derivatives of t0”.

Now, following this note of Landau, we can construct a scheme of calculating the

required derivatives, taking into account that ϕ and A must not depend on x, y, z, t

explicitly:

and

we have (after an algebraic simpliﬁcation):

Putting ϕ from Eqs.(3), Eq.(16) and Eq.(17) together, we have (after simpliﬁcation):

In turn

∂ϕ

= qc

β(1 − β2 + R ˙β/c) + ( ˙β/c)(R − Rβ)
(R − Rβ)2

.

Finally, substituting Eqs. (14), (16) and (18) in Eq.(12) we obtain:

E =

3This follows from the expressions R = c(t − t0) and R = r − r0(t0). See [2].

(R − R V

(R ˙β/c)(R − Rβ) − (R ˙β/c)(R − Rβ)
(R − Rβ)3

.

Now, using the formula of double vectorial product, it is not worth reducing the numerator
of the second term of Eq.(20) to [R × [(R − Rβ) × ˙β/c]]. As a result we have Eq.(1).

Analogically, substituting Eqs. (14) and (18) in Eq.(13) we obtain

B =

−Rβ(1 − β2 + R ˙β/c) − (R ˙β/c)(R − Rβ)

(21)

If we add R(1 − β2 + R ˙β/c) to the numerator of the second term of the vectorial product
(21)4 we obtain Eq.(2) (see Eq.(19))

In the next section we shall consider a charge moving with a constant acceleration

along the X axis and we shall show that the Eq.(7) is not satisﬁed if one substitutes E

and B from Eqs.(1) and (2) in Eq.(7) and takes into consideration exclusively a retarded

interaction. To verify this we have to ﬁnd the derivatives of x−, y−, z−components of the

ﬁelds E and B with respect to the time t and the coordinates x, y, z. The functions E

and B depend on x, y, z, t through t0 from the conditions (8)-(9). In other words, we shall

show that these ﬁelds E and B do not satisfy the Maxwell equations if the diﬀerentiation

rules (11) that were applied to ϕ and A (to obtain E and B) are applied identically to E

and B.

3. Does the retarded electromagnetic ﬁeld of a charge moving with a constant

acceleration satisfy Maxwell equations?

Let us consider a charge q moving with a constant acceleration along the X axis. In

this case its velocity and acceleration have only x-components, respectively V(V, 0, 0) and

a(a, 0, 0). Now we rewrite the Eqs. (1) and (2) by components:

Ex(x, y, z, t) = q

(V 2 − c2)[RV − c(x − x0)]
[(cR − V (x − x0)]3

(

Obviously, these components are functions of x, y, z, t through t0 from the conditions

(8)-(9). This means that when we substitute the ﬁeld components given by Eqs.(22)-(27)

in the Maxwell equations (4)-(7), we once again have to use the diﬀerentiation rules as in

(11):

In order to calculate the derivatives ∂E(or B)k/∂t0 we need the values of the expres-

∂R
∂t0

∂x0
∂t0

and

∂V
∂t0

= a.

Now, using Eqs. (29) and (33), we want to verify the validity of Eqs.(30)-(32). The

result of the veriﬁcation is as follows6:

The veriﬁcation7 shows that Eq.(30) is valid. But instead of Eq.(31) and Eq.(32) we

have Eq.(35) and Eq.(36) respectively. A reader has to agree that this result is rather

unexpected.

However, another way to obtain the ﬁelds (1) and (2) exists. If one uses this manner

to verify the validity of Maxwell’s equations, one ﬁnds that ﬁelds (1) and (2) satisfy these

equations. In the next section we shall consider this way in detail and we shall show that

it does not correspond to a pure retarded interaction between the charge and the point of

observation.

5See the footnote (3).

6The expressions (34)-(36) were calculated using the program “Mathematica, Version 2.2”,
therefore it is easy to check these calculations.

If one substitutes E and

B from (10) in Eq. (7), one only has to satisfy oneself that the operators “∇×” and “∂/∂t”
commute. In our case, because of V = (V, 0, 0) and A = (Ax, 0, 0), it means the commutation of
the operators ∂/∂y(or z) and ∂/∂t. The veriﬁcation shows that these operators do not commute
if one uses the rules (11).

4. Double (implicit and explicit) dependence of ϕ, A, E and B on t and xi.

Total derivatives: mathematical and physical aspects

Let us, at the beginning, consider in detail Landau’s method [2] to obtain the deriva-

tives ∂t0/∂t and ∂t0/∂xi. Landau considered two diﬀerent expressions of the function

R = c(t − t0),

where

t0 = f (x, y, z, t)

(37)

R:

and

R = [(x − x0)2 + (y − y0)2 + (z − z0)2]1/2,

where

x0i = fi(t0).

(38)

Then one calculates the derivatives (∂/∂t and ∂/∂xi) of functions (37) and (38), and

equating the results obtains ∂t0/∂t and ∂t0/∂xi. While Landau uses here a symbol ∂

(see the expression before Eq. (63.6) in [2]) in order to emphasize that R depends also

on others independent variables x, y, z, it is easy to show that he calculates here total

derivatives of the functions (37), (38) with respect to t and xi. The point is that if a given

function is expressed by two diﬀerent types of functional dependencies, exclusively total

derivatives of these expressions with respect to a given variable can be equated (contrary
to the partial ones). Here we adduce the scheme8 which was used in [2] to obtain ∂t0/∂t
and ∂t0/∂xi:

8In this scheme we have used a symbol d for a total derivative. In original text [2] we have

If one takes into account that ∂t/∂xi = ∂xi/∂t = 0, as a result obtains the same values

Let us now, as it was mentioned above in the ﬁn of Section 3, calculate the expressions

and

where

Now, let us consider all derivatives in (10), (40)-(43) as total derivatives with respect

to t and xi. Then, if substitute the expressions (40)-(43) in (10) (of course, taking into

account either lhs or rhs of the scheme (39)), we obtain formally the same expressions

for the ﬁelds (1) and (2)! Then if one substitutes the ﬁelds (1) and (2) in the Maxwell’s

9This depends on the choice of the expression for R in (37), (38)

10

equation (7), considering all derivatives in (7) as total ones and, of course, considering

the functions E and B as functions with both implicit and explicit dependence on t (or

on xi), one can see that the equation (7) is satisﬁed!

5. Conclusion

in this case!

If we consider only the implicit functional dependence of E and B with respect to the

time t, this means that we describe exclusively the retarded interaction: the electromag-

netic perturbation created by the charge at the instant t0 reaches the point of observation

(x, y, z) after the time τ = R(t0)/c. Surprisingly, the Maxwell equations are not satisﬁed

If we take into account a possible explicit functional dependence of E and B with

respect to the time t, together with the implicit dependence, the Maxwell equations are

satisﬁed. The explicit dependence of E and B on t means that, contrary to the implicit de-

pendence, there is not a retarded time for electromagnetic perturbation to reach the point

of observation. A possible interpretation may be an action-at-a-distance phenomenon, as

a full-value solution of the Maxwell equations within the framework of the so called “dual-

ism concept” [9,10]. In other words, there is a simultaneous and independent coexistence

of instantaneous long-range and retarded short-range interactions which cannot

be reduced to each other.

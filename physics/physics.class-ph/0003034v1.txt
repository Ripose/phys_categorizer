Abstract

In this paper the main consequences of the vector theory of excitation of resonators
by particle beams are presented. Some features of excitation of broadband radiation in
longitudinal modes of the enclosed and open resonators are discussed.

(1)

These equations are a set of two vector and two scalar equations for vectors of electric
~E(~r, t) and magnetic ~H(~r, t) ﬁeld strengths or eight equations for six independent components
of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. We suppose that the charge density ρ(~r, t) and current
density ~J(~r, t) are given values. It means that only four components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
strengths are independent.

The solution of these equations includes transverse electromagnetic ﬁeld strengths of free elec-
tromagnetic waves ~Etr, ~H tr and accompanied longitudinal electric ﬁeld strengths ~El of Coulomb
ﬁelds of the beam crossing the resonator. Transverse electromagnetic ﬁeld strengths excited by
the beam in the resonator comply the condition div ~Etr = div ~H tr = div ~H = 0. Longitudinal
electric ﬁeld strength comply the condition rot ~El = 0, div ~El = 4πρ [2] - [5]1. Free electro-
magnetic ﬁelds in resonators are solutions of homogeneous Maxwell equations (~ = ρ = 0)
with corresponding boundary conditions. These solutions are a sum of eigenmodes of the res-
onator which include a discrete set of eigenfrequences ωλ and corresponding to them functions
~Eλ(~r, t), ~Hλ(~r, t) for the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths (further we will omit the super-
scripts tr and l in the ﬁelds). The subscript λ includes three numbers (m, n, q) corresponding to
transverse and longitudinal directions of the resonator axis. In the case of open resonators the
transverse electromagnetic T EMmnq modes are excited. When the number q is very high then

1In general case transverse ﬁelds are not only free electromagnetic waves. Both a static magnetic ﬁeld, a
magnetic ﬁeld accompanying a homogeneously moving particle and arbitrary time depended magnetic ﬁeld are
transverse one. A part of the Coulomb electrical ﬁeld accompanying a relativistic particle is transverse one. The
most simple example of the transverse electric ﬁeld strength is the electric ﬁeld strength of the homogeneously
moving relativistic particle ~E tr = ~E − ~E l, where ~E = e~r/γ 2r∗3, ~E l = e~r/r3, ~r is the radius vector directed from the

particle to the observation point, γ =p1 − β 2 relativistic factor of the particle, R∗ = (x −vt)2 +(1 −β 2)(x2 +y2),

β = v/c, v the velocity of the particle [1], [2]. After a particle beam cross a resonator then only transverse free
electromagnetic waves stay at the resonator.

this number is omitted. Usually in the open resonators many longitudinal modes are excited
even in the case of free-electron lasers emitting rather monochromatic radiation.

The solution of the problem of excitation of resonators is simpliﬁed by introduction of a
~Aλ(~r, t) of free electromagnetic ﬁelds in Coulomb gauge
transverse vector potential ~A(~r, t) =Pλ
div ~A = 0, where scalar potential ϕ = 0 when ρ = 0 (here we omitted the superscripts tr and
l in the vectors ~Atr). The corresponding wave equation for this vector can be solved by the
method of separation of variables when we suppose ~Aλ(~r, t) = qλ(t) · ~Aλ(~r), where qλ(t) is the
amplitude of the vector potential and ~Aλ(~r) is the eigenfunction of the resonator normalized by
the condition R | ~Aλ(~r)|2dV = 1. In this case the total free electromagnetic ﬁeld in the resonator
is described by the expression ~A(~r, t) = Pλ ~qλ(t) ~Aλ(~r).
The electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths of the transverse free ﬁelds in resonators can be
expressed through the vector potential in the form ~Eλ(~r, t) = −d ~Aλ(~r, t)/d ct = − ˙qλ(t)· ~Aλ(~r)/c,
~Hλ(~r, t) = rot ~Aλ(~r, t) = qλ(t)· rot ~Aλ(~r), where ˙qλ(t) = d qλ(t)/d t. When the charge and current
densities are in the resonator then a scalar ϕσ and a longitudinal vector potential ~Al (rot ~Al = 0)
determine Coulomb ﬁelds of the beam in the resonator. We are not interesting them in this
paper.

When active and diﬀractive losses in the open resonator are absent then the vector potential
of a free electromagnetic ﬁeld in the resonator excited by the beam can be presented in the form

~A(~r, t) = Xλ

qmλ ~Aλ(~r)eiωλt,

(2)

where the coeﬃcient qmλ is the amplitude of the excited eigenmode.

The electromagnetic ﬁelds excited by the electromagnetic beam are determined by the non-

homogeneous Maxwell equations or the corresponding equation for the vector potential

The solution of the Eq(3) can be found in the form ~A(~r, t) = Pλ qλ(t) ~Atr

σ(~r)
(here we stayed superscripts tr and l and used the conditions ~Aλ,σ(~r, t) = qλ,σ(t) · ~Aλ,σ(~r)).
If we will substitute this expression into equation (3), integrate over the volume of the res-
onator, use the condition of normalizationR | ~Aλ(~r)|2dV = R | ~Aσ(~r)|2dV = 1,R ~Aλ(~r) ~Aλ′ (~r)dV =
R ~Aλ(~r) ~Aσ(~r)dV = R ~Aσ(~r) ~Aσ′ (~r)dV = 0 and take into account that the vector ~Aλ comply with
the condition ∆ ~Aλ = −(ωλ/c)2 ~Aλ then we will receive the equation for change of the amplitude
of the eigenmode qλ for free ﬁelds in the resonator

The expression (4) is the equation of the oscillator of unit mass excited by a force f (t) =
~J (~r, t) ~Aλ(~r)dV . It describes the excitation of both enclosed and open resonators [3] -

[5]. The same expression for force determine the excitation of waveguides [2].

(4π/c)RV

The eigenmodes of the rectangular resonators (cavities) were discovered by J.Jeans in 1905
when he studied the low of thermal emission. The equations (4) was used later for quantization
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in quantum electrodynamics [3].

2 Emission of electromagnetic radiation by electron beams in

open resonators

The equation (4) does not take into account the energy losses of the emitted radiation in the
resonator. These losses can be introduced through the quality of the resonator Qλ

where in the case of the open resonator ωr = 2π/T , T = 2L/c is the period of oscillations of the
light wavepacket between the resonator mirrors when it passes along the axis of the resonator
(notice that in general case the frequencies ωλ = ωmnq depend on m, n, q and slightly diﬀer
from frequencies ωrq). Here we have introduced a version of a deﬁnition of a resonator quality
connected with the frequency ωr. Another version of a quality is usually connected with the
frequency ωλ. Our deﬁnition is more convenient for the case of free-electron lasers using open
resonators.

Using (5) we can derive the expression for the energy balance in the resonator. For this
purpose we can multiply this equation by ˙qλ and integrate over the volume of the resonator.
Then we receive the equation

The equation (5) is the pendulum equation with a friction. It determine the time evolution
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld stored at the resonator, when the time dependence of the beam
current ~J(~r, t) is given. The amplitude qλ(~r, t) according to (5) is determined by the coeﬃcient
of expansion of the given current into series of eigenfunctions of the resonator. Notice that the
value ~Aλ[~re(t)] depends on t only through ~re(t) and the value ~Eλ[t, ~re(t)] = − ˙qλ(t) · ~Aλ[~re(t)]/c
depends on t directly through qλ(t) and through ~re(t).
In the case of one particle of a charge ”e” the beam current density ~J (~r, t) = e~v(t)δ[~r−~re(t)].
In this case the force f (t) = e~v[~re(t)] ~Aλ[~re(t)] and the power transferred from the electron

It follows from (5), (7) and (8), (9) that transverse resonator modes are excited only in the
case when the force f (t) 6= 0 and the power Pλ(t) 6= 0 that is when the particle trajectory
passes through the regions where the corresponding resonator modes have large intensities and
when the particle velocity has transverse and/or longitudinal components directed along the
direction of the electric ﬁeld strength. Open resonators on the level with enclosed ones have
modes with longitudinal components of electric ﬁeld strength (see Appendix). It means that
open resonators can be excited even in the case when the particle trajectory have no transverse

components and its velocity is directed along the axis of the resonator2. Using external ﬁelds of a
single bending magnet can increase the power of the generated radiation. Both in the case of lack
of a banding magnet and presence of one bending magnet the broadband radiation is emitted.
The experiment conﬁrms this observations [7]. Using external ﬁelds of undulators and beams
bunched at frequencies of the emitted radiation can lead to emission of rather monochromatic
radiation.

In the simplest case when the beam current density ~J(~r, t) is a periodic function of time then
ν=−∞ fλν exp[i(νωbt −
ϕλν )], where ωb = 2π/Tb and Tb are a period and frequency of the current density oscillation
−Tb/2 f (t) exp(iνωbt)dt, are the known coeﬃcients, ϕλν phase. The
λν is the complex conjugate of fλν. The solution of the equation (5)

the force can be expanded in the series f (t) = RV
accordingly, fλν = (1/Tb)R Tb/2
value fλ −ν = f ∗

It follows from the equation (10) that the maximum of the amplitude of the vector potential
Aλν = Qλfλν/ωrω2
λ takes place at resonance νωb = ωλ = ωmnq ≃ ωrq. Notice that all modes λ
are excited at the same frequency ωb of the oscillator. In general case ωb 6= ωλ.
The equation (10) is the ﬁrst order linear equation of the energy change in the resonator
excited by the electron beam. It follows from this equation that after switching oﬀ the beam
current at some moment t0 ( ~J (~r, t)|t>t0 = 0) the energy in the resonator will be changed by
the law εem
λ |t=t0 . On the contrary after
switching on the beam current at some moment t0 the energy in the resonator will be changed
by the law εem

The considered example describes the emission of an oscillator or a system of oscillators
which are in phase with the excited mode and have zero average velocity (trajectory has a form
re = re0 + ~ıa0 cos ω0t, where ~ı is the unite vector directed along the axis x). More complicated
examples of trajectories of particles using for excitation of resonators by electron beams can be
considered (the arc of circle, sine- or helical-like trajectories in bending magnets and undulators).

3 Vector TEM modes of open resonators

The theory of high quality open resonators does not diﬀer from enclosed ones. But eigenmodes
of open resonators have some unique features. The spectrum of the open resonators is rareﬁed,
the operating mode spectrum has maximum selectivity. The dimensions of open resonators are
much higher then the excited wavelengths and the dimensions of the enclosed resonators are of
the order of excited wavelengths. The quality of open resonators at the same wavelengths is
higher then enclosed ones.

2In this case the transition radiation is emitted by particles when they pass the walls of a resonator. The
electromagnetic radiation will be emitted in the form of thin spherical layers at the ﬁrst and second resonator
mirrors [6]. It will be reﬂected then repeatedly by resonator mirrors. The expansion of the electromagnetic ﬁelds
of the spherical layers will be described by the series (2).

There are some methods of calculation of TEM modes in open resonators. Usually scalar
wave equations are investigated [8], [9]. There is a small information in technical publications
about distribution of vectors of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths in such resonators. In
this section we search some distributions. In the Appendix the foundations of the excitation of
resonators by electron beams are presented .

We will present the result for the Cartesian coordinates.

In this case the solution of the

scalar wave equation (24) (see Appendix) has a form [10]

We have the solutions (11), (12) of the scalar wave equation (24) for the space limited beam.
Now we can ﬁnd vectors of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths using the expressions (23)
and possible ways of construction of Hertz vectors. Let us suppose the next compositions with
the electric Hertz vector assuming that magnetic Hertz vector is zero:

1) Πe

x = U (x, y, z), Πe

y = Πe

z = 0.

2) Πe

x = 0, Πe

y = U (x, y, z), Πe

z = 0.

3) Πe

x = 0, Πe

y = 0, Πe

z = U (x, y, z).

In the ﬁrst case

div~Π = ∂Πx/∂x = ∂V /∂x exp[i(kz − ωt)], (rot~Π)x = 0,
(rot~Π)y = (∂V /∂z + ikV ) exp[i(kz − ωt)], (rot~Π)z = −(∂V /∂y) exp[i(kz − ωt)]

The upper superscript shows the ﬁrst composition of the Hertz vector. A common multiple

exp[i(kz − ωt)] for all ﬁeld components is omitted.

In the third case

div~Π = ∂Πx/∂z = ∂V /∂x exp[i(kz − ωt)], (rot~Π)x = ∂V /∂y exp[i(kz − ωt)],
(rot~Π)y = −∂V /∂x exp[i(kz − ωt)], (rot~Π)z = 0

It follows that in the case of the main mode the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths corre-

The electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths received from magnetic Hertz vector can be received

(15)

where ci are the arbitrary coeﬃcients determined by the conditions of excitation of the mode by
the electron beam. Waves determined by the only coeﬃcient ci (when another ones are equal
to zero) can be excited independently.

Higher modes in the open resonator will be described by the expressions (15) and by the
expressions similar to (14) for the electromagnetic ﬁeld strengths of the main mode. They will
form orthogonal and full set of fundamental waves. The arbitrary wave may be expanded into
these waves. Of cause, real electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths are determined by the real part
of the expression (15).

In the open resonators the same Gaussian beams are excited. They propagate between
mirrors both in z and in −z directions. However the resonators will be excited on discrete set
of eigenfrequences (wavelengths) [10].
We can see that according to (14) all considered waves ~Ei, ~H i are transverse. At the same
time they have longitudinal components. This is the general property of the convergent and
divergent waves [4], [10]. Such waves have longitudinal components which permit the lines of
the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths to be closed.

The ﬁelds ~E1, ~H 1 describe an electromagnetic wave with one direction of polarization and
the ﬁelds ~E2, ~H 2 with another one. They have high transverse components of the electric and
magnetic ﬁeld strengths and zero longitudinal components on the axis z.

Electromagnetic ﬁelds ~E3, ~H 3 are a new kind of ﬁelds. They have zero transverse compo-
nents of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths and high value longitudinal component of the
electric ﬁeld strength at the axis z (similar to the wave E01 at the axial region of the cylindrical
waveguide). It means that in this case the lines of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths are
closed in the directions both at the central part of the beam propagation that is near to the axis
z and far from the axis that is near to the region of theirs envelopes (caustics)3.

Usually the scalar functions V (x, y, z) or U (x, y, z) = V (x, y, z) exp[i(kz− ωt)] are used when
the modes in open resonators are investigated [4], [8], [9]. It was supposed that the waves are
transverse ones and the values of the electromagnetic ﬁeld strengths are distributed near the
same way as the values of the scalar functions. At that some features like the existence of
the wave ~E3, ~H 3 were hidden. Such waves have longitudinal components of the electric ﬁeld
strength and hence can be excited through the transition radiation emitted on the inner sides
of the resonator walls by an electron homogeneously moving along the axis z. Such excitation
was observed in the experiments published in [7].

4 Conclusion

Open resonators permit an eﬀective generation of broadband radiation at the main and/or other
transverse modes under conditions when many longitudinal modes are excited. The longitudi-

3Notice that usually the divergent waves with high directivity emitted by antennas are described and drawn
by the lines of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths which are closed in the directions far from the axis of the
beam propagation near to the region of theirs envelops.

nal modes are limited in the longwavelength region by the diﬀraction losses and in the short
wavelength region by the longitudinal electron beam dimensions (coherence conditions). Open
resonators can be excited in the case when the external ﬁelds in the resonator are absent and the
particle trajectory is directed along the axis of the resonator. Using external ﬁelds of a single
bending magnet can increase the power of the generated radiation [7].

Appendix

Generation and propagation of electromagnetic waves in vacuum is described by Maxwell
equations (1). We noticed above that these equations are a set of eight equations for six inde-
pendent components of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Only four components of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld are independent. These equations added with initial and boundary conditions
describe all processes in electrodynamics.

There is no general solution of the system of Maxwell equations with boundary conditions
similar to the Lienard-Viechert solution for the ﬁelds produced by charged particles moving along
some trajectories at a given low in free space. It means that private problems must be solved
separately for every concrete case. At that when the boundary conditions exist, interactions of
particles with surrounding media and intrabeam interactions of particles are essential then the
beam density and beam current can not be given and the dynamical Lorentz equations must
be added. Below we will consider the case when the beam density and the density of the beam
current (particle trajectories) are given.

One of the possible simpliﬁcations of the solution of the Maxwell equations is to transform
linear Maxwell equations to the equations of the second order relative to the ﬁeld strengths or
potentials.

First of all the Maxwell equations can be transformed to the equations separately for the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds. For this purpose we can diﬀerentiate equation (1.b) with respect
to t, use equation (1.c) and employ the vector identity rot rot ~F = grad div ~F − ∆ ~F , where ∆ is
the Laplacian operator. Such a way we will receive the equation for the electric ﬁeld strength
and then by analogy we will receive the equation for the magnetic ﬁeld strength. They are

where ✷ = ∆ − ∂2/c2∂t2 is the d’Alembertian operator,
The equations (16) are the nonhomogeneous linear equations of the second order. We must
add the equations (1.a), (1.d) to the system of the equations (16). It means that we have again
a system of two vector and two scalar equations (in components they are eight equations) for
six unknown components of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths Ei, Hi.

˙~J = ∂ ~J/∂t.

The divergence of the equation (16.a) leads to a more general continuity equation (∂/∂t)(∂ρ/

∂t +div ~J ) = 0 which is valid when the continuity equation ∂ρ/∂t + div ~J = 0 is valid.

The solution of the Maxwell equations will be the solution of these second order equations.
The second order equations are another equations. Strictly speaking they are not equivalent
to Maxwell equations. We must check theirs solutions by substituting these solutions into the
linear Maxwell equations to reject unnecessary solutions. This is very diﬃcult problem even
for simple cases. A way out can be found by introducing of electromagnetic ﬁeld potentials.
The vector potential ~A and scalar potential ϕ are introduced by the equations ~H = rot ~A,
~E = −gradϕ− (1/c)(∂ ~A/∂t). In this case both from Maxwell equations and from the equations
(16) it follows the equations for vector and scalar potentials

It is convenient to use the electric and magnetic Hertz vectors as well. They permit to
simplify the solutions of the problem of propagation of waves in resonators and free space which
is described by the homogeneous wave equations (ρ = 0, ~J = 0). Both the electric and magnetic
Hertz vectors ~Πe, ~Πm are introduced by the same expressions

Such way deﬁned potentials ~A and ϕ will satisfy the equation (11) simultaneously.
Diﬀerent superscripts e/m in this case are used on the stage of introduction of the connection
between electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths through Hertz vectors. The electric ﬁeld strength
can be expressed through the electric and magnetic Hertz vector by the equations

These manipulations are valid because of both deﬁnitions (20) and (21) satisfy Maxwell equa-
tions (1) and equations (16). This is because of homogeneous wave equations for electromagnetic

when vectors ~Πe and ~Πm fulﬁl the wave equation (22) with replaced ~F → on ~Πe and ~Πm.
to use scalar wave equation

Equation (22) is valid for each component of vectors ~Πe and ~Πm. That is why it is possible

✷U = 0

(24)
and identify its solution U with one of components of vectors ~Πe or ~Πm and the rest components
of these vectors equate to zero (say we can take ~Πe = ~ex·0+~ey ·0+~ez ·U, ~Πm = 0). Substituting
the constructed such a way vector with one component in (16) we will ﬁnd the electromagnetic
ﬁeld strengths ~E, ~H which satisfy the Maxwell and wave equations. Then we can identify the
same solution with another component of the Hertz vector, equate the rest components to zero

and calculate another electromagnetic ﬁeld strengths ~E, ~H which satisfy the Maxwell and wave
equations as well. After we will go through all compositions with components then we will have a
set of six diﬀerent solutions for ﬁeld strengths ~E, ~H. These solutions will be six electromagnetic
waves with diﬀerent structures. Sum of these solutions with some coeﬃcients will be a solution
of the Maxwell equations as well. This will be algorithm of electromagnetic ﬁeld determination
through Hertz vector.

Equation (24) has many diﬀerent solutions. We must ﬁnd such solutions which will corre-
spond to the problem under consideration to a considerable extent. Below we will deal with
monochromatic light beams of the limited diameter related with resonator modes. In general
case such beams can be written in the form

(25)
where V (x, y, z) is a function of coordinate slowly varying in comparison with exp i(kz − ωt). A
complex form of values will be used for computations and then we will proceed to a real part of
the form.

U (x, y, z) = V (x, y, z)ei(kz−ωt)

Substituting (25) into (24) and taking into account the slow variation of V (x, y, z) compared
with exp i(kz − ωt) that is the condition |∂2V /∂z2| ≪ 2k|∂V /∂z| and the condition k = ω/c we
will receive the equation

which describes a space limited beam.

In the general case the limited in the transverse direction wave propagating in free space
or in a resonator have rather complicated structure. That is why it is desirable to ﬁnd full,
orthogonal set of fundamental waves with the well known feature of propagation. Then an
arbitrary wave may be expanded into series of these waves. Diﬀerent series of fundamental
waves can be found for this problem and the arbitrary wave can be expanded into one or
another series. The method of separation of variables is used to solve the wave equation. For
example, in the Cartesian coordinates V (x, y, z) = X(x, y, z) · Y (x, y, z) and in the cylindrical
coordinates V (x, y, z) = G(u)Φ(ϕ) exp[ikr2/2q(z)] · exp[iS(z)], where r and ϕ are cylindrical
coordinates on a plane transverse to z, u = r/w(z). These solutions are considered in [10].

Abstract

We deﬁne and compute the renormalized four–momentum of the
composed physical system: classical Maxwell ﬁeld interacting with
charged point particles. As a ‘reference’ conﬁguration for the ﬁeld
surrounding the particle, we take the Born solution. Unlike in the
previous approach [5] and [3], based on the Coulomb ‘reference’, a
dependence of the four–momentum of the particle (‘dressed’ with the
Born solution) upon its acceleration arises in a natural way. This
will change the resulting equations of motion. Similarly, we treat the
angular momentum tensor of the system.

1 Introduction

Classical, relativistic electrodynamics is unable to describe interaction be-
tween charged particles,
Indeed,
typical well posed problems of the theory are of the contradictory nature:
either we may solve partial diﬀerential equations for the ﬁeld, with particle
trajectories providing sources (given a priori !), or we may solve ordinary dif-
ferential equations for the trajectories of test particles, with ﬁelds providing

intermediated by electromagnetic ﬁeld.

forces (given a priori !). Combining these two procedures into a single theory
leads to a contradiction: Lorentz force due to self-interaction is inﬁnite in
case of a point particle. Replacing point particle by an extended object is not
a good remedy for this disease because it requires a ﬁeld-theoretical descrip-
tion of the interior of the particle (rigid spheres do not exist in relativity!).
This means that the three degrees of freedom of the particle must be replaced
by an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom of the matter ﬁelds constituting
the particle. Moreover, a highly nonlinear model for the interaction of these
ﬁelds must be chosen in order to assure the stability of such an object. As a
consequence, there is no hope for an eﬀective theory.

There were many attempts to overcome these diﬃculties. One of them
consists in using the Lorentz–Dirac equation, see [2],[4],[9]. Here, an eﬀective
force by which the retarded solution computed for a given particle trajectory
acts on that particle is postulated (the remaining ﬁeld is ﬁnite and acts by
the usual Lorentz force). Unfortunately, this equation has many drawbacks
(cf. Section 8 of [5]). See also [12] for another approach to this problem.

In papers [5] and [3] a mathematically consistent theory of the physical
system “particle(s) + ﬁelds” was proposed, which overcomes most of the
above diﬃculties even if some problems still remain. The theory may be de-
ﬁned as follows. We consider a system consisting of charged point particles
and the electromagnetic ﬁeld fµν. We always assume that the latter fulﬁlls
Maxwell equations with Dirac ,,delta-like” currents deﬁned uniquely by the
particle trajectories. Given such a system, we are able to deﬁne its total
,,renormalized four-momentum”. For a generic choice of ﬁelds and particle
trajectories this quantity is not conserved. Its conservation is an additional
condition which we impose on the system. It provides us the missing ,,equa-
tions of motion” for the trajectories and makes the system mathematically
closed (cf. [3]).

Deﬁnition of the renormalized four-momentum of the system composed
of ﬁelds and particles, proposed in [5], was based on the following reason-
ing. Outside of the particles, the contribution to the total four–momentum
carried by the Maxwell ﬁeld fµν is given by integrals of the Maxwell energy–
momentum tensor–density

T µν = T µν(f ) = √

over a space–like hypersurface Σ (the notation is prepared for working in
curvilinear coordinates). Unfortunately, the total integral of this quantity is

2

divergent because of the ﬁeld singularities at the particle’s positions. The idea
proposed in [5] is to consider for each particle a ﬁctitious “reference particle”
which moves uniformly along a straight line tangent to the trajectory of the
real particle at the point of intersection with Σ. The constant velocity u
of this hypothetical particle is thus equal to the instantaneous velocity of
the real particle at the point of intersection. Give a label (i) to each of
those hypothetical particles and consider the corresponding Coulomb ﬁeld
f C
(i) boosted to velocity u(i).
In the rest frame of the (i)-th particle, the
magnetic and electric components of this ﬁeld may be written as

BC

(i) = 0,

(DC

(i))k =

e(i)
4π

xk
r3 .

(3)

The “reference particle” has the same charge e(i) and the same rest mass m(i)
as the real particle. By the mass we mean, however, not the “bare mass”,
which must later be “dressed” with the energy of its Coulomb tail (which
always leads to inﬁnities during renormalization procedure), but the total
energy of the composed system “particle + ﬁeld” at rest. Hence, the total
four–momentum of the i’th reference particle (together with its ﬁeld f C
(i))
equals

(i) = m(i)uν
pν

(i) .

Now, to deﬁne the renormalized four-momentum pCν carried by the par-
ticles and the ﬁeld fµν surrounding them, we split the energy-momentum
density T (f ) into the sum of the reference densities T (f C
(i)) and the remain-
ing term. According to [5], the remaining term is integrable (more strictly,
the principal value of the integral exists), while T (f C
(i)) terms are already
“taken into account” in the four–momenta m(i)u(i) of the particles (com-
puted at the points of intersection). Hence, the “Coulomb–renormalized
four–momentum” of the system is deﬁned by the following formula:

pCν := P

T µν(f C

It was proved in [5] that pCν depends on Σ only through the points Ai of
intersection of Σ with the trajectories. Next, one postulates that pCν doesn’t
depend on those points. This condition implies the dynamics of the particles
[5] and makes the evolution of the system unique (cf. [3]).

The above theory is not completely satisfactory, because the subtraction
(i)) in (4) kills only terms which behave like r−4, while the r−3-terms

of T (f C

remain in (4) and are integrated with r2dr (for simplicity we assume here
that Σ near the particle corresponds to x0 = const. in the rest frame). This
phenomenon is implied by the analysis of the Maxwell ﬁeld behaviour in the
vicinity of the particle, cf. (5) or Section 5 of [5]. It leads to logarithmic
divergencies which disappear only due to the principal value sign P in front
of the integral (4). That sign means that we ﬁrst compute the integral over
Ui is a small symmetric neighbourhood of the
Σ
∪Ui and
i-th particle and then we pass to the limit with
Ui shrinking to the point:
Ai. The symmetry is necessary to kill the r−3-term under integration
Ui →
because it is anti-symmetric.

U

The main result of the present paper is a new, improved renormalization
procedure, which does not rely on the symmetry of
Ui. We call this new pro-
cedure a Born renormalization, because the Coulomb reference for a moving
particle, matching only its velocity, is here replaced by the Born solution,
matching both the velocity and the acceleration of the particle.

We are going to prove in the sequel, that the four-momentum deﬁned
via the Coulomb–renormalization is a special case of the result obtained via
Born–renormalization, while the physical interpretation of the latter is more
natural: all the integrals occurring here are uniquely deﬁned without any
use of the principal value sign. Moreover, the ultra-local dependence of the
four-momentum upon the acceleration of the particle, implied by the Born
renormalization, will change the equations of motion of the particles. That
dependence may be also a key to the instability problem of the theory (with
an appropriate dependence of the involved functions on the acceleration).
We prove in Section 6 that, disregarding this dependence, we recover the
previous Coulomb-renormalized formulae.

Our results are based on an analysis of the behaviour of the Maxwell ﬁeld
in the vicinity of the particles done in papers [7], [6] (cf. also [2]). Although
the asymptotic behaviour of the radiation ﬁeld far away from the sources
may be found in any textbook, the “near-ﬁeld” behaviour is less known.
The main observation is that – for any choice of particle trajectories – the
diﬀerence between the retarded and the advanced solution is bounded (in the
vicinity of the particles). Hence, we restrict our considerations to the ﬁelds
which diﬀer from the particle’s retarded (or advanced) ﬁeld by a term which
is bounded in the vicinity of that particle. We also assume that the ﬁeld at
, is at most of the order of r−2. Fields fulﬁlling
spatial inﬁnity, i.e. for r
those requirements are called regular. In the particle’s rest frame, regular

where ˜B, ˜D are bounded and ak are the components of the acceleration of
the particle. Above formulae may be proved for the retarded ﬁeld using
[2],[6],[7])1. Hence, they are valid for all
Lienard–Wiechert potentials (cf.
regular ﬁelds.

Our paper is organized as follows. In Sections 2 and 3 we recall and in-
vestigate the Fermi–propagated system of coordinates and the Born solution.
In Sections 4–7 we restrict ourselves (for simplicity) to the case of a single
particle interacting with the ﬁeld (A straightforward generalization of these
results to the case of many particles is given in Section 8. This generalization
does not require any new ingredient because interaction between particles is
intermediated via linear Maxwell ﬁeld.) In Section 4 we deﬁne the Born–
renormalized four–momentum pBν of the system and prove that it depends
on the hypersurface Σ through the point of intersection with the trajectory
only. In Section 5 we assume that Σ near the trajectory coincides with the
x0 = const. in the Fermi system which allows us to ﬁnd an explicit expression
for pBν. In Section 6 we compare pBν with the Coulomb–renormalized pCν of
[5]. The diﬀerence of the two is a function of four–velocity and acceleration at
the point of intersection. In Section 7 we extend the results of Sections 4–6 to
the case of the angular momentum tensor. The fall-oﬀ conditions at spatial
inﬁnity and technical details of the proofs are presented in Appendices.

We stress that our approach to renormalization never uses any cancel-
lation procedure of the type ”+
”. Here, everything is ﬁnite from
∞ − ∞
the very beginning and the point particle is understood as a mathematical
model, approximating a realistic, physical particle which is assumed to be
extended. To formulate such a model one has to abandon the idea of a point
particle “ﬂoating over the ﬁeld” but rather treat it as a tiny “strong ﬁeld
region” (its internal dynamics is unknown but – probably – highly nonlin-
ear), surrounded by the “week ﬁeld region”, governed by the linear Maxwell
theory. The strong ﬁeld region (particle’s interior) interacts with the ﬁeld via
1We use this opportunity to correct a missprint in formulae (77)–(79) of [6]: the right
hand sides should be multiplied by r and the indices below B on the left hand sides should
be increased by one. Correct formulae for the arithmetic mean of the retarded and the
advanced ﬁelds may be found in [7].

its boundary conditions. In other words: the idea to divide “horizontally”
the total energy of the system into: 1) the “true material energy” + 2) the
free ﬁeld energy and, ﬁnally, 3) the interaction energy which adds to the
previous two contributions, must be rejected from the very beginning. Such
a splitting, which is possible for linear systems, makes no sense in case of
a realistic particle. In our approach, only “vertical” splitting of the energy
into contributions contained in disjoint space regions, separated by a chosen
boundary, makes sense because of the locality properties of the theory.

The main advantage of the theory constructed this way is its universal-
ity: the ﬁnal result does not depend upon a speciﬁc structure of the particle’s
interior, which we want to approximate. Moreover (what is even more im-
portant!), it does not depend upon a choice of the hypothetical ,,boundary”
which we have used to separate the the strong ﬁeld region from the weak ﬁeld
region: the only assumption is that it is small with respect to characteristic
length of the external ﬁeld.

2 The Fermi–propagated system

In this Section we recall and investigate the properties of the Fermi–propaga-
ted system of coordinates. It is a non–inertial system such that the particle
is at rest at each instant of time. The use of the Fermi system simpliﬁes
considerably description of the ﬁeld boundary conditions in the vicinity of
the particle, given by (5) and (2). The price we pay for this simpliﬁcation is
a bit more complicated (with respect to the inertial system) description of
the ﬁeld dynamics, cf. [5], [7].

r, θ, φ. The Born solution of Maxwell equations with a delta-like source

solution describes two symmetric particles with opposite charges and opposite
accelerations. Actually, the Born solution may be deﬁned as a unique solution
of the problem which is invariant with respect to the symmmetry group
of
the problem and satisﬁes other natural assumptions (cf. [11],[8]).

4 The Born-renormalized four-momentum

Throughout the paper we assume that the particle has no internal degrees
of freedom, i. e. it is completely characterized by its charge e and mass
m. Consider a regular Maxwell ﬁeld f consistent with the trajectory of the
particle (cf. Section 1). We ﬁx a point A on its trajectory, corresponding to
given values of the proper time τ , four–velocity u and acceleration a.

Formula (4) for the Coulomb-renormalized four-momentum was based
on the following heuristic picture: A real, physical particle is an extended
object, an exact solution of the complete system: “matter ﬁelds + electro-
magnetic ﬁeld”. The reference particle (passing through A and moving with
the constant four–velocity u) is also an exact, stable solution of the same
system, which, moreover, is static (,,soliton-like”). Outside of a certain small
radius r0 the matter ﬁelds vanish and the electromagnetic ﬁeld reduces to the
Coulomb ﬁeld f C. Hence, for
which is very small from the macroscopic
point of view but still big from the microscopic point of view (i.e. much
bigger than the ball K(A, r0) around the particle), the total amount of the
four-momentum carried by the soliton solution and contained in

equals:

Now, we assume that also the Born solution has its “extended-particle

of boosts) solution, which coincides with the Born ﬁeld
f B outside of a certain small radius r0 around the particles. This solution
represents a pair of uniformly accelerated particles. Denote by P ν(u, a) the

The Born ﬁeld f B above is computed assuming that the proper time τ , u,

Fermi coordinates xl on it.

Unfortunately, the above deﬁnition cannot be directly generalized to the
case of many particle system because, in general, there is no common rest-
frame space Στ for diﬀerent particles. In what follows we shall rewrite the
above deﬁnition in a way, which admits an obvious generalization to the case
of many particles. For this purpose we replace Στ by an arbitrary spacelike
hypersurface Σ which is ﬂat at inﬁnity. More precisely, one has

Deﬁnition. Hypersurface Σ as in the Proposition is called special if Σ
coincides with Στ in a neighbourhood of A, i. e. if one can take P = Pτ (cf.
the Noether theorem ∂µT µν = 0).

Idea of proof. First let Σ be special (P = Pτ ) and choose

contained
Σ. Then the ﬁrst terms in (27) and (28) coincide (f is a solution of
in Pτ ∩
Maxwell equations, we use Noether theorem) and (28) holds. We can assume

that in Fermi coordinates
we can take any ˜Σ, ˜P , ˜
as in the Proposition and denote the corresponding
O
right hand side of (28) by ˜pBν. We need to prove pBν = ˜pBν. Now we modify

The above formula renormalizes the ﬁeld inﬁnity near the particle, leav-
ing opened the standard convergence problems at spatial inﬁnity (r
).
We discuss brieﬂy these issues in Appendix A. Here, we only mention that
these global problems never arise, when the particle’s equations of motion
are derived from the momentum and the angular momentum conservation.
Indeed, the conservation condition may always be veriﬁed locally, i. e. on
a family of hypersurfaces ˜Στ which coincide outside of a certain (spatially
compact) world tube T . Comparing the value of angular momentum calcu-
lated on two diﬀerent ˜Στ never requires integration outside of T , because the
far-away contributions are the same in both cases.

8 The case of many particles

proper time τi. The space–like hypersurface Σ passes through all Ai. At
Σ around Ai are contained
the beginning we assume that some regions
Στi corresponding to the i-th particle and that, asymptotically, Σ
in Pτi ⊂

A Field fall-oﬀ conditions at spatial inﬁnity
and a possibility to deﬁne global angular
momentum

→ ∞

To deﬁne the four-momentum of the system, we assume that the ﬁeld be-
) like r−2. To deﬁne globally the
haves at spatial inﬁnity (i. e. for r
angular momentum of the system, much stronger fall-oﬀ conditions are nec-
essary. Here, we present a possible choice: we assume that the ﬁeld behaves
at spatial inﬁnity like a superposition of boosted Coulomb ﬁelds (modulo
r−3–terms). Then (for any space-like hyperplane) the angular momentum
density behaves like an anti-symmetric r−3–term (modulo r−4–terms). This
is suﬃcient to deﬁne global value of angular momentum using the “principal
value” sign for integration at inﬁnity. This means that we ﬁrst integrate over
spatially symmetric regions V
Σ of an asymptotically ﬂat hypersurface Σ
and then pass to the limit V
Σ. The symmetry depends upon a choice
of a central point x0, but it is easy to check that the ﬁnal result of such a
procedure does not depend upon this choice. Moreover, the above asymptotic
conditions allow us to change Σ at inﬁnity. Indeed, the diﬀerence between
results obtained for diﬀerent Σ’s equals to a surface integral at inﬁnity which
vanishes as a consequence of the assumed asymptotic conditions (cf. also [1]).
We stress, however, that the renormalization proposed in the present paper
cures the local and not global problems. Derivation of particle’s equations of
motion from ﬁeld equations does not rely on the global problems.

B Approximation by the Born ﬁeld near the

trajectory

Suppose (cf. Section 4) that we have two trajectories: of a real particle p and
of the reference particle ˜p, which is uniformly accelerated. Both trajectories
touch at A, where the proper times τ0, the four–velocities u, the accelerations
a and e(l) coincide. In general, the quantities related to ˜p diﬀer from those
Στ0 = ˜Στ0, but for H
related to p and are distinguished by tilde. Then A

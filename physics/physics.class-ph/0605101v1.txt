We examine the Bloch-Peierls-Berry dynamics under a classical nonequilibrium dynamical formulation.
In this formulation all coordinates in phase space formed by the position and crystal momentum space
are treated on equal footing. Explicitly demonstrations of the no (naive) Liouville theorem and of the
validity of Darboux theorem are given. The explicit equilibrium distribution function is obtained. The
similarities and diﬀerences to previous approaches are discussed. Our results conﬁrm the richness of the
Bloch-Peierls-Berry dynamics.

Introduction

One of the fundamental dynamical equations in condensed matter physics is the so-called Bloch equation,
˙r =
describing one electron moving in a periodic potential in position and crystal momentum space [1]:
1
~∇k ǫ(k) , ~ ˙k = −e∇r φ(r) . Here r ∈ ℜ3 is position, k ∈ ℜ3 crystal momentum, ǫ(k) ∈ ℜ1 kinetic energy,
φ(r) ∈ ℜ1 the electric potential, e the electric charge of an electron, and ~ the Planck constant. The index
l in the gradient operation, ∇l ≡ ∂/∂l indicates the corresponding space coordinate. A scalar function
H(r, k), termed the Bloch Hamiltonian, can be deﬁned as

˙r = ∇kH and
In this case, the Bloch dynamics can be rewritten in the canonical Hamiltonian form:
˙k = −∇rH. The usual incompressible condition, the Liouville theorem, in the six dimensional xτ ≡ (r, k)
phase space follows,

H(r, k) =

1
~ [ǫ(k) + eφ(r)] .

∇x · ˙x = ∇r · ˙r + ∇k · ˙k

= ∇r · ∇kH − ∇k · ∇rH

= 0

R. Peierls successfully extended the Bloch equations to the case with a weak magnetic ﬁeld B(r) [1]:
˙r = 1
~∇k ǫ(k), and ~ ˙k = −e∇r φ(r) − e˙r × B(r). The Hamiltonian in the form of Eq.(1) remains the
same for this extended dynamics, and the Liouville theorem of Eq.(2) still holds. Everything appears as
expected.

However, the Bloch equations of electron dynamics have been recently modiﬁed to include both magnetic
ﬁeld B(r) and Berry curvature Ω(k) in crystal momentum space [2]. The following extended dynamical

equations in the semiclassical limit were obtained, termed Bloch-Peierls-Berry equations in the present
paper:

˙r =

1
~ ∇k ǫ(k) − ˙k × Ω(k)
~ ˙k = −e∇r φ(r) − e˙r × B(r)

Interesting, unexpected, and rich behaviors occur in the context of this novel dynamics [2, 3]. For example,
it has been found that in six dimensional phase space the current ﬂow becomes compressible, that is, the
Liouville theorem does not hold [3]:

∇x · ˙x 6= 0.

Thus the straight-forward conventional means to Hamiltonian analysis does not appear available. Such a
situation has been called non-Hamiltonian dynamics [3].

To remedy this problem of non-Hamiltonian dynamics, Xiao et al. [3] introduced a density correction
~B · Ω in the present paper, to force the divergence in phase space to zero:

factor, denoted J(r, k) = 1 + e

∇r · (J(r, k) ˙r) + ∇k · (J(r, k) ˙k) = 0

Of primary motivation using this technique was in the deﬁnition of a phase distribution function consistent
with the Liouville theorem, because the Liouville theorem states that phase volume in a canonical Hamil-
tonian formulation is conserved along it’s trajectory. This has some good properties. For example, with
the Liouville theorem a distribution function over a system phase, x, will be time-invariant. To verify this
property we begin with the total time derivative of a distribution f (x, t) in phase space, df
∂t + ˙x · ∇xf
and the continuity equation, ∂f
∂t + ∇x · ( ˙xf ) = 0. When the Liouville theorem holds, ∇x · ˙x = 0, the
continuity equation is identical to the time-invariant distribution, df /dt = 0.

dt = ∂f

Disagreement on the treatment in Ref.[3] exist in literature [4, 5, 6, 7]. For example, in a comment
from Duval et al., [5], an alternate approach was pointed out such that a local canonical form, and likewise
a Hamiltonian description, is achievable. In addition to the question of mathematical formulation, there
is a real issue of possibly diﬀerent physical consequences in diﬀerent approaches [8].

In the present paper we study the problem from a completely diﬀerent point of view to see how the
Hamiltonian like structure and the equilibrium distribution function emerge from a nonequilibirum process:
the Darwinian dynamics [9]. We will show that a Hamiltonian, or energy function, naturally emerges. In
our demonstration it is clear that the Berry phases due to the magnetic ﬁeld and the Berry curvature of
the momentum space appears in equal footing. Furthermore, such a procedure provides a straightforward
discussion on the equilibrium distribution: a nonequilibrium setting provides a natural way to select the
steady state distribution. Not all of our results are new. Nevertheless, our demonstration appears to provide
a clear, consistent, but completely classical starting point to detail the system characteristics as previously
described while possessing no proclivity toward an incompressible or canonical phase. For example, a
direct solution to the Fokker-Planck equation has been detailed. This solution is found independent of the
Liouville theorem and may oﬀer a unique insight into a probability distribution.

We begin the remainder of the paper in section 2 by ﬁrst describing the generic decomposition of
Darwinian dynamics and arranging the Berry modiﬁed Bloch equations, Eq. (3), to this form. In section 3

2

we will present the divergence analytically to show that the system is compressible. In section 4 we evaluate
the Jacobi identity to show that a local canonical form exists and in section 5 we reveal the evolution of
a probability distribution developed directly from the general form of Darwinian dynamics. Section 6 is a
summary and discussion.

2 Evolutionary Decomposition and Conservation of “Energy”

2.1 Darwinian dynamics

The Darwinian dynamics arises from a generic nonequilibrium process common in biological, physical,
and social sciences [9]. One of it’s main features is to treat all dynamical variables on an equal footing.
This is typically achieved through expression of the dynamics in a set of ﬁrst order stochastic diﬀerential
equations.

Given a generic ﬁrst order dynamic system of states, x, separated into the deterministic, f (x), and

stochastic, ζ(x, t), components:

˙x = f (x) + ζ(x, t)

The noise is typically approximated as Gaussian and white with zero mean, hζ(x, t)i = 0, and variance as

hζ(x, t)ζ τ (x, t

)i = 2 ω D(x) δ(t − t

′

′

) .

Here the nonnegative constant ω plays the role of temperature in physics. Further characterization of the
noise comes from the diﬀusion matrix D.

There then exists a unique decomposition as follows [9, 10, 11, 12]:

[S(x) + T (x)] ˙x = −∇xΦ(x) + ξ(x, t)

Here S is a symmetric and positive deﬁnite friction matrix, related to the zero-mean Gaussian and white
noise as follows

hξ(x, t)ξτ (x, t

)i = 2 ω D(x) δ(t − t

′

′

) .

T (x) is an antisymmetric matrix, Φ(x) a scalar potential function and S a symmetric matrix. By deﬁnition
S is positive semi-deﬁnite, ˙xτ S ˙x ≥ 0, and will have a dissipative eﬀect on the potential function, showing a
tendency to approach the potential minima. The T matrix describes a non-dissipative part of the dynamics,
˙xτ T ˙x = 0, and tends to conserve the potential function.

2.2 Reformulation of Bloch-Peierls-Berry equations

Now we reformulate the Bloch-Peierls-Berry equations from the point of view of Darwinian dynamics,
treating position and momentum coordinates in equal footing. We begin the decomposition of these
equations (3) by arranging them in terms of the complete state vector x in the form of Darwinian dynamics,
Eq.(8). The friction matrix S may not be known. We assume its existence and may take it to be zero at
the end of calculation whenever needed. The existence of electron-phonon interaction and other dissipative

(6)

processes and their small possible eﬀect in a solid justiﬁes such a procedure. Beginning from this formation
of our descriptive matrices a potential function will then become apparent.

We rewrite the Bloch-Peierls-Berry equations, Eq.(3):

˙x ≡

˙r
˙k!
1
~∇k ǫ(k)
~∇r φ(r)!
− e
Here the matrix M ∈ ℜ6×6 contains the eﬀects of both magnetic ﬁeld B in position space and Berry
curvature Ω in momentum space.

With I as an identity matrix, Eq.(10) becomes:

This is almost in the form of Eq.(8) of Darwinian dynamics and the right hand side appears similar to
the gradient of the Bloch Hamiltonian H, Eq. (1). Suggesting that the Hamiltonian or energy function
in the Bloch-Peierls-Berry dynamics may indeed be the original Hamiltonian of Eqs. (3). This makes a
notable potential function because it is a straightforward representation of the total energy in the system,
we neglect the constants e and ~ when speaking of total energy because they can simply be absorbed into
x.

We also must mind the order and sign of the state vector x compared to the right side of Eq. (12). To

be consistent an orthogonal transformation matrix R is applied to both sides of the equation (12).

The right side of Eq.(12) becomes

Collecting all terms the Bloch-Peierls-Berry equation, Eq.(3), is then transformed into the form of Dar-
winian dynamics, Eq.(8):

The S matrix, as well as the diﬀusion matrix D, is null in this case, which may be thought as the zero
electron-phonon interaction limit. The equivalent form to Eq.(6) of the Darwinian dynamics is

T (x) ˙x = −∇xH(x)

˙x = −Q(x)∇xH(x) ,

with Q(x) = T −1(x). A Poisson bracket can be easily deﬁned as

6

[f (x), g(x)] ≡

Qij(x)

∂f
∂xi

∂g
∂xj

.

i,j=1
X
Here f and g are two arbitrary functions of the phase space x. The Poisson bracket is anti-symmetric
because Q is. With this Poisson bracket, the Bloch-Peierls-Berry equations are now

˙x = [H(x), x] ,

the familiar form in Hamiltonian dynamics.

2.3 Conservation of energy

The potential function of Bloch-Peierls-Berry dynamics in the form of Darwinian dynamics may be clearly
identiﬁed as the Bloch Hamiltonian:

Φ(x) = H(x) =

1
~ [ǫ(k) + eφ(r)] .

It is straightforward to verify that such an “energy” given by the Bloch Hamiltonian is conserved in the
Bloch-Peierls-Berry dynamics, as expected:

Thus, we may indeed identify the Bloch Hamiltonian given in Eq.(2) as the candidate for the Hamiltonian
for the Bloch-Peierls-Berry dynamics of Eq.(3), upon the clariﬁcation of two questions raised in the liter-
ature, the validity of the Liouville theorem, and the validity of the Darboux theorem, to be discussed in
the next two sections.

3 Compressibility and No Liouville Theorem

Here we will determine an analytical result for the divergence of the Bloch-Peierls-Berry equations (3) from
the Darwinian dynamics given by Eq. (17), and show that it is indeed non-zero and thus compressible. This
compressibility feature is pronounced and surprising, as pointed out in Ref.[3]. An explicit demonstration
is given in light of the present Darwinian dynamics formulation.

The equation in question is, following Eq.(8):

We ﬁrst note that because T −1 is antisymmetric only the divergence of the T −1 matrix on the right hand
side of the equation need be considered:

∇x · ˙x = −∇x · (T

(x)∇xH(x))

−1

∇x · ˙x = (∇x · T

−1

)∇xH(x)

Next, we note a useful identity expressing the divergence of T −1 as a function of the divergence of T ,

because T is easier to operate on. This identity is found as follows, where I is the identity matrix:

The T −1(i, :) denotes the ith row in the T −1 matrix.
Solving for ∇x · T −1 in Eq. (25) we obtain:

This simpliﬁcation has also allowed us to express the divergence independent of H once combined with

Eq. (24) as follows (this will prove to be useful later.)

Eq. (28b) is revealed from the fact that the divergence of the Berry curvature, Ω, as well as the magnetic
ﬁeld, B, are equal to zero. Both are deﬁned as the curl of a vector function and the divergence of a curl
must be zero, ∇ · ∇ × f = 0:

We see that the divergence is time-varying given that both B and Ω are non-zero and non-orthogonal.
Thus our system phase space is, in general, compressible, that is the Liouville theorem does not hold. This
feature was used in Ref.[3] as the indication that the dynamics were non-Hamiltonian. However, diﬀerent
opinions have been voiced [4, 5, 6, 7]. A related point will be explicitly exposed in the next section.

(cid:17)

4 Jacobi Identity

In this section we follow a standard procedure in mathematical physics [13, 14] to determine when a system
can be (locally) regarded as a Hamiltonian system. In this regard, there are two important conditions
the system has to satisfy. The ﬁrst is the existence of a Poisson bracket which must be explicitly anti-
symmetric. The second is on the validity of the Darboux theorem. The incompressible condition, or the
Liouville theorem, does not appear to be essential in this regard.

The existence of an antisymmetric Poisson bracket has already been deﬁned in the previous section,
Eq.(19), which endows the system with a speciﬁc dynamical structure which may not be a (local) canonical

7

Hamiltonian system. For the Darboux theorem, which guarantees that a non-degenerate system can be
expressed in local canonical coordinates, the crucial condition to it’s validation is the presence of the Jacobi
identity.

We express the Jacobi identity as the sum of the cyclic permutations of the double Poisson bracket.
Here f (η), g(η), and h(η) are any functions with continuous second derivatives and η is the system space
in consideration. The Jacobi identity is:

(31)

(32)

(33)

Direct evaluation to verify the Jacobi identity would involve a great deal of algebra. By computing the

Poisson bracket as a summation over each vector ﬁeld we notice most of the terms cancel out.

Here T −1(i, j) = Qij(x) is the ijth element of the T −1 matrix. Also to more easily display derivatives a

The next two double Poisson brackets give similar results and because T −1 is antisymmetric the ﬁrst
2 terms in the parentheses of each will cancel out [15]. In the simple case in which the transformation
matrix is antisymmetric and independent of x this will alone satisfy the identity. However, diﬃculty arises
because dT −1/dxi 6= 0 and we are left with the third term of each permutation containing the derivative
of the T −1 matrix as follows:

[f, [g, h]] + [h, [f, g]] + [g, [h, f ]] =

Eq. (35) is arranged to collect the arbitrary f, g, h functions. Because each figkhl is unique the ex-
pression in parentheses must equal zero for every combination of i, k, l in order to satisfy the identity.

Because i, k, l = 1, 2, ..., 6 there are 63 equations that we must prove are equal to zero. However, we
have been able to express all of them in four general forms through index notation. To show how this is
possible it is helpful to ﬁrst state the T −1 matrix in index notation. Here each quadrant is a 3 × 3 matrix

When solving Eq. (35) with the index notation given in (36) a distinct diﬀerence in solutions is noticed
when i, k, l have values of 1, 2, or 3 and when they have values of 4, 5, or 6. To take advantage of this we
will now improve our notation of each subset of i, k, l. A value between 1 and 3 will be denoted by r and
between 4 and 6 by k. Particular values in r and k can now be described by integers between 1 and 3 for
the sake of index notation. In the following solutions these integers are given, again, by a, b, and c which
are unrelated to those in (36). The speciﬁc process to arrive at each solution is straightforward but lengthy
and is excluded here. The ﬁnal simpliﬁed solution for each subset is as follows.

As previously mentioned in Eq. (29) the divergence of both Berry curvature in momentum space and
the magnetic ﬁeld in position are zero and each subset above will also be zero. It should also be noticed that
the above equations only accommodate one half of the 63 total equations. The rest come from permutations
in (r, k, k) and (k, r, r) and are similar expressions.

Thus the Jacobi identity is satisﬁed for the Bloch-Peierls-Berry dynamics. Hence the Darboux theorem
holds. Therefore, these dynamics can be locally mapped into a canonical form of Hamiltonian dynamics,
and may be named Hamiltonian dynamics. In fact a global transformation has even been suggested [4].
The reformulation of Bloch-Peierls-Berry dynamics into Darwinian dynamics makes this point evident from
a completely diﬀerent perspective.

Fokker-Planck Equation and Equilibrium Distribution

The general form of the present Darwinian dynamics described by Eq. (8) has been shown to correspond
to a Fokker-Planck equation describing probability evolution in phase space [9, 11, 12]:

∂ρ(x, t)
∂t

= ∇τ

x ·

D(x) + Q(x)

ω∇x + ∇xΦ(x)

ρ(x, t)

(39)

Here ω is a non-negative constant equivalent to temperature. D is a symmetric matrix and Q is an
antisymmetric matrix so that

h(cid:2)

(cid:3)(cid:2)

(cid:3)i

(D + Q) = (S + T )

−1

.

Applying Eq.(39) to the Bloch-Peierls-Berry equation as given in Eq. (17) we ﬁnd that D = 0 and

Q = T −1, thus there is only an anti-symmetric part and the diﬀusion matrix D is in the zero limit:

∂ρ(x, t)
∂t

= ∇τ

ω∇x + ∇xΦ(x)

T −1∇xΦρ

The term on the far right side of the equation can be seen to represent the probability ﬂow divergence,
⇒ ∇x · ( ˙xρ), by substituting Eq. (17). Thus in the trivial case where ω = 0 Eq. (40)
∇x ·
becomes the standard form of the continuity equation. The term ∇x · (ω∇x · T −1)ρ in Eq. (40) represents
the additional eﬀect on distribution at non-zero temperatures.

(cid:0)

We now provide a plausible argument for another choice of equilibrium distribution other than that
in Ref.[3]. First, we note that in the anti-symmetric matrix T in Eq.(17), the geometric phases due to
the magnetic ﬁeld B [16, 17] and the novel Berry curvature Ω are in equal footing. They all contribute
in the same manner to the geometric phase for a possible close trajectory in the phase space. A unifying
description of the dynamics is hence achieved in this Darwinian dynamics formulation.

Second, in the case that dynamics are dissipative in phase space, for example if there are indeed electron-
phonon and electron-impurity interactions, then the friction or resistance matrix S, and hence the diﬀusion
matrix D, is not zero. Such a dissipative dynamics is very likely to be described by Eq.(8). Further, such
a dissipative dynamics in the presence of Berry phase has been well characterized in condensed matter
physics, such as the dynamics of topological singularities in superconductors and superﬂuids [18]. Thus,
extending Bloch-Peierls-Berry dynamics to include dissipation as in the form of Eq.(17) or (8) indeed
appears to be a natural choice.

Based on the above considerations we may adopt Eq.(39) as the equation for dynamics of non-interacting
electrons in the presence of dissipation. The equilibrium distribution for such dynamics immediately reads:

The partition function summing up all probability in phase space may be deﬁned as

The time dependent free energy for such an open system may be deﬁned as

which always decreases towards the equilibrium value Feq = −ω ln Z.

We note that if treating the equilibrium distribution ρeq as a single particle distribution, one immedi-
ately notices a diﬀerence between the present result and the one obtained in Ref.[3] (c.f. their reference
[21]) in the same limit.

6 Discussions

We have investigated the Bloch-Peierls-Berry dynamics from a nonequilibrium dynamical point of view.
The Bloch-Peierls-Berry equations can be reformulated into a simple and generic form. Using this re-
formulation we have explicitly demonstrated the compressibility of Bloch-Peierls-Berry dynamics and the
embedded Jacobi identity, both were pointed out previously in literature. From the point of view of Hamil-
tonian dynamics, we explicitly showed that the violation of the “naive” Liouville theorem is not essential.
At the same time we reached a distribution function similar to what is implied in Ref.[3].

There are two new features in our study that we would like to point out. The ﬁrst one is that our study
is in the classical domain, and is for one electron. No many-body eﬀect, as strongly suggested in Ref.[3],
has been considered here. Hence, from the condensed matter physics point of view, our work may be
relevant in the dilute and non-interacting limit, with a relatively high temperature. In this sense, it would
be further interesting theoretically to see how the Boltzmann equation implicitly discussed in Ref.[3] would
relate to the present Fokker-Planck equation. In particular, how the electron-phonon type interaction with
explicit energy dissipation would be incorporated into formulation in Ref.[3].

The second feature is that due to the open system nature our probability dynamics formulation is
necessarily in the domain of the canonical ensemble, where the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution is emphasized.
This also implies that there is a preferred and natural choice of phase space. Instead, the discussion of
Hamiltonian ﬂow in Ref’s.[4, 5] appears within the micro-canonical ensemble. It is well known that the
transition from micro-ensemble to canonical ensemble is not unique. This may be the reason that within
the present nonequilibrium formulation there is no compelling reason to emphasize the Liouville theorem,
even though the Hamiltonian structure is evident in both approaches.

In conclusion, the present exploration from the Darwinian dynamics perspective has further revealed

the richness of Bloch-Peierls-Berry dynamics.

Abstract

The inﬂuence of material coverings on the antenna bandwidth is investigated for
antennas formed by thin electric or magnetic line sources. It is shown that uniform
thin layers of arbitrary passive materials (including Veselago, left-handed, or double-
negative materials) cannot help to overcome the bandwidth limitations imposed by
the amount of energy stored in the antenna reactive ﬁeld. Alternative possibilities
oﬀered by complex composite materials in the antenna design are identiﬁed.

1 Introduction

Properties of antennas depend on materials that may cover metal radiating parts or ﬁll the
antenna volume. For instance, it is known that the bandwidth of microstrip antennas can
be improved by using magnetic substrates [1, 2, 3]. In the recent literature there is renewed
interest to the question of improving antenna performance by loading the antenna with
complex materials. In particular, it is of interest if new artiﬁcial materials with negative
material parameters [4] can be useful in the antenna design. This problem has been
analyzed in a recent conference presentation [5] for a point dipole antenna surrounded by
a shell of a material with negative parameters, and some very promising results reported.
However, the key issue of the reactive energy storage and the antenna quality factor
calls for a more careful examination, because of inevitable frequency dispersion of passive
artiﬁcial materials.

In this paper we analyze in detail a very simple radiating system: an inﬁnite current
line in a material cylindrical shell. Assuming the diameter to be small compared with the
wavelength in the material, the ﬁeld equations can be solved analytically leading to simple
and physically clear formulas. The quality factor can be then deﬁned and calculated for
arbitrary dispersive and also for speciﬁc lossy coverings. The results of the analysis lead
to some general conclusions regarding the eﬀect of thin material coverings on the antenna
performance.

2 Fields of a thin radiating material-covered cylinder

Figure 1: Radiating current line in a thin material cylinder.

We consider the radiation from a line electric or magnetic current embedded into
a material cylinder (Figure 1). The problem originates from a simpliﬁed model of a
thin-wire antenna covered by a thin layer of some material. The antenna bandwidth is
investigated by means of the eﬀective impedance per unit length of the antenna wire.
The real part of the introduced eﬀective impedance corresponds to the radiated power
(radiation resistance), and the imaginary part gives information about the energy stored

in the antenna near ﬁeld. A thin material layer covering the radiating current aﬀects the
stored energy and, if the material is lossy, the radiated power. Our aim is to ﬁnd how
this changes the antenna bandwidth.

Let us consider an inﬁnitely thin line of time-harmonic electric current I. We assume
the current to be uniform in its phase and its amplitude along the line. We model a thin
radiating wire of radius r0 as such current line sitting at the wire axis. This method is
similar to taking into account only the local (singular) part of the thin-wire kernel (e.g.,
[6]). We denote the covering cylinder outer radius as a, the frequency of operation as
ω, and the material parameters of the outer space and the covering as ǫ0, µ0, and ǫ, µ,
respectively. Hence, for the wave number in the outer space we have k0 = ω√ǫ0µ0, and
for that in the material we have k = ω√ǫµ. The branch of the square root in the last
relation is chosen so that Im

3 Antenna quality factor

The antenna bandwidth is related with the antenna quality factor. The well-know def-
inition for the quality factor of a lossy (in the antenna case losses are mostly due to
radiation) resonator is

where W is the average reactive energy stored in the resonator, and P is the total dis-
sipated power (for an antenna this is a sum of the radiated power and the thermal loss
power). Although Q deﬁned by this formula is mostly used for resonant systems, it can be
also used as a relative measure of ability of an aperiodic system to store reactive energy.
Usually, the quality factor of antennas is evaluated integrating the reactive ﬁeld energy
density over the whole space and integrating the Poynting vector in the far zone. In our
present case, where both the stored energy and the radiated energy are due to the current
in the antenna wire, we can use a simpler method introducing the eﬀective impedance per
unit length of the wire as follows:

Z =

Ez(r0)
I

,

−

where Ez(r0) means the total longitudinal electric ﬁeld component created by the con-
sidered line current at the surface r = r0. The minus sign is because we suppose I to
be given (external) current. This approach is sometimes called the induced electromotive
force method. The ﬁeld component of interest is given by

Ez(r0) = AH (2)

Let us ﬁrst assume that the losses in the material cover can be neglected. In this case we
can ﬁnd the quality factor in terms of the derivative of X(ω) with respect to the frequency.

Here, we follow the approach used in [7]. Instead of considering steady-state harmonic
oscillations, we study a transient regime characterized by an exponentially growing (or
decaying) amplitude of harmonic oscillations. For this regime we introduce a complex
frequency:

Positive values of α result in growing oscillations, negative values correspond to decaying
ω. This implies a very slow rate of the amplitude change,
ones. We assume that
hence, for the reactive energy W (averaged over a period of oscillations) stored in the
circuit we can write

Ω = ω

2αW.

The coeﬃcient 2 is there because the energy is proportional to the square of the oscillation
amplitude. The circuit impedance as a function of the introduced complex frequency
becomes

We see that exponential growth of oscillation amplitude results in an additional resistance
as well as an additional reactance.

In the case of negligible dissipation loss which we consider at this stage it is possible to
split the total active power (proportional to the real part of the eﬀective impedance) into
parts corresponding to radiation and increase of the stored reactive energy. Indeed, the
radiated power can be calculated knowing the far-zone ﬁelds. If there is no dissipation loss
in the antenna, then the way how to ﬁnd the energy storage power is straightforward. A
complexity comes when the loss and storage processes are combined (see the next section).
Comparing Eqs. (16) and (22) we see that for our case the radiation resistance (per

unit length) is

Rrad =

Then the energy storage power is given by (we use the eﬀective values of the ﬁelds and

3.2 Lossy and dispersive covering cylinder

If the covering material is dispersive and the dissipation losses cannot be neglected, the
quality factor cannot be determined from the analysis of the antenna impedance only. The
reason is that the active part of the impedance determines the total active power delivered
to the antenna, but we need to know what part of this power is used to increase the stored
energy and what part is dissipated into heat. The quality factor can be, however, found,
if we actually know the internal structure of the analyzed system. In our particular case,
the result will depend on the structure and design of the loading material.

where the magnitude factor A and the loss factor Γ do not depend on the frequency. This
material can be realized, for example, as a dense array of small split-ring resonators made
of metal wires or strips. The total impedance of the covered antenna (21) we write as a
sum of the antenna impedance without material cover and an additional impedance due
to the material cylinder:

If the permeability obeys (33), to model Zmedium we can introduce a magnetic-coupled
circuit shown in Figure 2. Indeed, in terms of the introduced eﬀective parameters, the
additional impedance associated with the material can be written as

Naturally, one wants to minimize dissipation in the antenna in order to increase the
antenna eﬃciency. However, from (44) it is seen that if the losses in the material become
very small (R
0), the total quality factor reduces to the well-known relation for an
→
oscillatory circuit:

which means that most of the energy is stored in the medium layer and almost all the
source power goes into heat (the antenna eﬃciency tends to zero).

Next, let us ﬁx a given eﬃciency value ﬁxing the resistance, the resonant frequency

and the coupling. To decrease (44) one should increase the capacitance.
C
0. One can see that
the total impedance of a medium particle and the medium eﬀective impedance become
simply resistive in the limiting case:

. For a given ﬁxed resonant frequency that means L

→ ∞

→

Hence, the deepest drop in the total quality factor can be achieved if the medium loading
is equivalent to a simple resistor. The limiting value for the quality factor is for this case

as expected. Note also that when the inductance L tends to zero, a better model should
assume that also the mutual inductance M tends to zero.
In that case the eﬀect due
to the material cover simply disappears in the limit, as the particles forming the cover
material are not excited.

Because the radiation resistance of the considered system does not depend on the layer
parameters and, moreover, the covering does not aﬀect the part of energy stored outside
the cylinder, the antenna quality factor and the bandwidth associated with radiation does
not change in the presence of covering. However, the total quality factor associated with
the input impedance of the antenna as a circuit element is very much aﬀected.

4 Discussion and conclusions

First of all, we see from Eq. (32) that the electric properties of the covering material have
disappeared from the antenna quality factor expression. Such situation is usual when
one considers thin coverings placed on top of electric conductors. But a more important
conclusion following from Eq. (32) is that we cannot achieve any improvement in the
antenna bandwidth even covering it with a (passive) magnetic material having a negative
permeability. This follows from the causality limitations on the material parameters of
any passive media with negligible losses [8]:

∂(ωǫr)

1,

∂ω ≥

∂(ωµr)

1.

∂ω ≥

(48)

Indeed, because of these limitations, the value of the ﬁrst term in braces in Eq. (32)
can only be increased compared to the case of empty ﬁlling (i.e. when µ = µ0), in turn
increasing Q and narrowing the bandwidth.

9

Considering a dual problem involving a magnetic current line as the radiating source
covered with the same material, one will get the same expression (32), only the magnetic
permeability will be replaced by the electric permittivity. There will be no bandwidth
improvement also.

In case of our example of an antenna with a dispersive and lossy covering, the addi-
tional stored reactive energy is of course also always positive, although the reactive part
of the input impedance can cross zero and the derivative of X(ω) can change sign. The
bandwidth can increase due to additional loss at a cost of reduced antenna eﬃciency. The
formulas for the stored energy in this case are not universal and depend on the material
structure, but the conclusion that the stored energy is positive in any passive system is
universal.

To summarize, homogeneous coverings of radiating metal wires1 by electrically thin
passive material layers lead to reduced bandwidth or lower eﬃciency, whatever exotic
properties these covering materials might have. The following alternative possibilities to
improve antenna performance using complex materials can be identiﬁed:

•

•

•

•

The use of radiating inclusions, and not really material coverings.

Shells of resonant dimensions. New materials can oﬀer more possibilities in opti-
mizing resonant antennas. Apparently, this is the case considered in [5].

Nonuniform coverings or material inclusions. This can modify the current distribu-
tion, possibly leading to increased bandwidth.

Active materials. If the passivity requirement is dropped, it is in principle possible,
for example, to realize wide-band weakly dispersive negative material parameters [9].
The stored reactive energy can be negative (and bandwidth very large), meaning,
eﬀectively, that the whole volume ﬁlled by this material is the source of power.

We show that the friction force and torque, acting at a dry contact of two objects moving and
rotating relative to each other, are inherently coupled. As a simple test system, a sliding and
spinning disk on a horizontal ﬂat surface is considered. We calculate, and also measure, how the
disk is slowing down, and ﬁnd that it always stops its sliding and spinning motion at the same
moment. We discuss the impact of this coupling between friction force and torque on the physics
of granular materials.

Sliding friction and incomplete normal restitution are
normally the main dissipation mechanisms at the contact
between two solid grains. They are largely responsible
for the fact that the ﬂow properties of granular media
diﬀer from those for liquids and solids. Their microscopic
origins are currently under intense investigation (see e.g.
[1]). On large scales compared to the grain diameter they
sometimes transform into unexpected phenomenological
friction laws, which have recently been discussed [2, 3, 4,
5, 6]. As the inﬂuence of rolling and torsion friction is
commonly regarded as negligible, they have been much
less investigated so far. However, it turns out that in
certain situations they may become crucial, for instance
for the stabilization of pores in cohesive powders [7, 8].
Another striking phenomenon will be discussed below.

In fact, rolling and torsion friction are indispensable
for a uniﬁed view of the dissipation mechanisms at the
contact of two viscoelastic spheres, because on the one
hand incomplete restitution and rolling friction, and on
the other hand sliding and torsion friction are coupled,
which will be the main point of this letter. These four
dissipation mechanisms correspond to the six degrees of
freedom of the relative motion at the contact between two
solid spheres. The relative motion of two solid spheres
has three translational degrees of freedom, characterized
by a velocity vector with one normal component vn (de-
formation mode) and two tangential components vt (slid-
ing mode), and three rotational ones, characterized by an
angular velocity vector, again with two tangential com-
ponents ωt (rolling mode) and one normal component
ωn (spinning mode). While the viscoelastic dissipation
mechanism of normal restitution and rolling friction cou-
ples vn and ωt [9, 10], the dissipation due to sliding and
torsion friction couples vt and ωn.

In this Letter we focus on the coupling between vt
and ωn. For viscoelastic spheres these are the domi-
nant dissipation channels in the quasistatic limit, where
(1
restitution coeﬃcient) [11, 12], as well as the co-
eﬃcient of rolling friction vanish [9]. The reason, why
torsion friction, i.e., the torque leading to a decrease of
ωn, is often neglected, is that it involves the radius of the
contact area between the two spheres and hence is small.

surface. (b)–(d) The relative velocity ﬁeld on the surface of
the disk at ε = 0.2, ε = 1, and ε = 5, respectively (ε = v/Rω).

Therefore, in order to make our point more clear, instead
of the contact between two spheres we consider a ﬂat disk
on a horizontal ﬂat surface with nonzero initial transla-
tional and angular velocity. The disk is lying on one of
its sides, and we assume that this side is in full contact
with the table during the motion [see Fig. 1(a)]. The fric-
tion force and torque acting on the disk will slow down
the sliding and spinning motion until the disk stops mov-
ing. We address two questions: (i) how are the friction
force and torque related to each other, (ii) what does this
imply for the coupling of sliding and spinning motion?

First we calculate the friction force and torque acting
on the disk as a function of its instantaneous velocity
and angular velocity. We apply the Coulomb friction
law, which says that the magnitude of the friction force
is proportional to the normal force, while its direction
is the opposite of the direction of the surfaces’ relative
velocity. Assuming that the mass distribution of the disk
is homogeneous, the friction force is
v + ω
v + ω

where R is the radius, v is the velocity, and ω is the
angular velocity of the disk, µ is the friction coeﬃcient,
and the integration extends over the area of the disk with
r vectors starting at the center. Fn is the normal com-
ponent of the force pressing the objects together at the

(ε) are positive for ε > 0,
the translational and angular velocities are strictly mono-
tonically decreasing in time, as expected. Now the ques-
tion arises: Is it possible that any of them reaches zero
before the other, i.e., may it happen that an initially slid-
ing and spinning disk after some time is only sliding or
spinning? We solved Eqs. (4) and (5) numerically with
many diﬀerent initial conditions. The results indicate, as
can be seen in Fig. 3(a), that v∗ and ω∗ always reach zero
together, meaning that the disk always stops its sliding
and spinning motion at the same moment. Before we
show its proof, let us try to explain qualitatively what is
happening. If the velocity is much higher than the an-
1), then the friction
gular velocity (v
torque is negligible compared to the force, see Fig. 2(a).
Therefore, the velocity decreases with a higher rate than
the angular velocity, and ε decreases. On the other hand,
if the angular velocity is much higher than the velocity
(ε
1), then the friction torque is higher than the force,
and ε increases. Thus a negative feedback eﬀectively
equilibrates the sliding and spinning motion. Indeed, the

FIG. 4: Function f (ε) = ε − F(ε)/2T (ε), the r.h.s. of diﬀer-
ential equation (6). It has zero value at ε = 0 and ε0 ≈ 0.653,
and is positive for 0 < ε < ε0, negative for ε0 < ε.

numerical results show this behavior, as ε always tends
0.653, when the motion stops
to the same value, ε0
[Fig. 3(b)]. This means that ω∗ and v∗ not only reach
zero simultaneously, but also that their ratio approaches
a universal value, irrespective of the initial conditions.

In order to prove that ε always has this value at the
end of the motion, we derive an autonomous diﬀerential
equation for ε from equations (4) and (5) using the vari-

disk. We set a standard writable CD disk (R = 6 cm),
with its data carrying side down, into motion manually
on a horizontal polyamid fabric surface several times, and
recorded its motion with a Sony DCR-VX2000E PAL dig-
ital video camera (25 images/second). Then we processed
the images to obtain the position and the orientation
of the disk as a function of time. We ﬁtted the posi-
tion and angular data with second degree polynomials to
get the instantaneous translational and angular velocity
and acceleration. Then, assuming that only gravitational
and frictional forces were acting on the disk, using Eqs.
(2) and (3), and having only the friction coeﬃcient as a
(ε) and
ﬁt parameter, we were able to plot functions
(ε), see Fig. 5. We had, however, a minor complica-
T
tion: We observed that the friction coeﬃcient slightly
increased linearly with the number of throws, n. We
found that µ = 0.202 + 0.00053n was a good ﬁt, and the
data presented in Fig. 5 was obtained using this “time-
dependent” friction coeﬃcient in the data processing. In-
vestigating the disk we concluded that the reason for the
increase of µ was probably that the ﬁlm on the CD was
gradually removed. The disk also had a 1.5 cm diameter
(ε) and
hole at its center, but a numerical calculation of
(ε) for this geometry showed that deviation from the
T
full disk case is not signiﬁcant, it is much smaller than
the accuracy of the measured data. Our experimental
data also showed that the disk always stopped its sliding
and spinning motion at the same moment (within error).

We used the sliding and spinning disk as a simple, il-
lustrative example to show how friction force and torque
are coupled. In this case we were able to derive all re-
sults analytically, because the local pressure is every-
where the same in the contact area. However, in general
the pressure distribution over the contact area will be

non-uniform. As an example, if we replace the ﬂat disk
by a cylinder standing on one of its ﬂat faces, then the
friction force leads to a torque with respect to the cen-
ter of mass. Provided that the cylinder does not topple,
this torque must be compensated by a pressure increase
at the front and a pressure decrease at the rear part of
the contact area. Therefore the spinning motion induces
a friction component perpendicular to the translational
motion, in the direction of v
ω. Hence, in contrast to
the straight sliding of a ﬂat spinning disk, the path of
the cylinder will be curved in this direction. This resem-
bles the Magnus eﬀect, although the physical origin is
completely diﬀerent.

The pressure distribution can also depend on the
shape and elastic properties of the sliding body. For in-
stance, if it is a sphere, linear elasticity theory predicts
r2/R2 shaped radial pressure function [15]. We
a
−
calculated the
(ε) curves numerically for this
case and found that their qualitative behavior remains
the same [16]. Therefore coupling between the friction
force and torque is still present: For large ε torsion fric-
tion is suppressed by sliding, for small ε sliding friction
gets reduced by spinning. This may explain, why the
translational motion of a fast spinning top is hardly de-
celerated.

Now let us consider what impact the coupling between
sliding and spinning motion may have on the physics of
granular media. In one limiting case, when the particles
are spherical and very hard, torsion friction typically can
be neglected, as the contact area is very small, hence
ε
1. However, on the one hand, real particles are usu-
ally non-spherical, or they may be very soft, so that the
size of the contact area can be comparable to that of the
particle. On the other hand, even in the case of hard
spherical particles with contact radius r much smaller
than the particle radius R, the coupling between sliding
and spinning motion can have subtle consequences. As
the torsion friction is very small in this case, one can ex-
pect that the spinning degree of freedom can be easily
excited. Typical sliding velocities will be comparable to
ωnR, so that ε
1. In this case, the sliding fric-
tion is basically µFn. However, when a granular packing
relaxes into a static conﬁguration, the coupling between
sliding and spinning becomes important. For example, if
the initial sliding velocity is zero, but the spinning de-
gree of freedom is excited (i.e., ε = 0), an arbitrarily
small force can induce sliding.

An important extension of this work will be to inves-
tigate the coupling between the static friction force and
torque. As static friction is diﬀerent from sliding friction,
and its theory is somewhat more diﬃcult, we cannot ex-
pect that the maximum static friction forces and torques
will lie on the friction-torque curve in Fig. 2(b). How-
ever, we have preliminary evidence that such coupling is

4

present also in the static case. We expect that the thresh-
old torques and forces needed to turn a sticking contact
into a sliding and/or spinning one form a curve which lies
above the one in Fig. 2(b). In particular, this implies that
the application of a torque at a sticking contact makes it
easier to excite the sliding degree of freedom. For hard
spherical spheres a very small torque will already have
this eﬀect.

Finally, the fact that

(ε) depend on the
pressure distribution in the contact area raises the ques-
tion, whether the “inverse problem” has a unique solu-
tion, i.e., are the experimentally accessible functions

and
(ε) a ﬁngerprint of the pressure distribution in the
contact area? This would also be an interesting question
to study in the future.

According to Goldstein1 “there seems to be no simple way of proving Jacobi’s identity for the
Poisson bracket without lengthy algebra.” This impression appears to be shared by other authors,
who either also explicitly do the lengthy algebra2−5 or leave the tedious work to the reader.6,7
The purpose of this note is to show that, contrary to this widespread belief, there is an extremely

short proof of Jacobi’s identity, based on the theory of inﬁnitesimal canonical transformations,
with virtually no algebra.

Let A(q, p) and B(q, p) be any two dynamical variables and consider an inﬁnitesimal canonical
transformation generated by C(q, p). On the one hand, Goldstein’s Eq.(9-103) with u = {A, B}
yields

On the other hand, since the Poisson bracket {A, B} does not depend on the canonical variables
chosen for its computation, its change is due only to the variations of A and B, so that

δ{A, B} = ǫ {{A, B}, C} .

δ{A, B} = {δA, B} + {A, δB} ,

whence

δ{A, B} = ǫ{{A, C}, B} + ǫ{A, {B, C}} .

Comparing (1) with (3) and making simple rearrangements one ﬁnds

{{A, B}, C} + {{C, A}, B} + {{B, C}, A} = 0 ,

which is Jacobi’s identity.

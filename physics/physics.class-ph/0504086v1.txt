Abstract

The questions of justiﬁcation of the Gibbs canonical distribution for systems with
elastic impacts are discussed. A special attention is paid to the description of prob-
ability measures with densities depending on the system energy.

Gibbs Distribution

Let x = (x1, . . . , xn) be generalized coordinates, y = (y1, . . . , yn) be conjugate
canonical momenta of a Hamiltonian system with n degrees of freedom and a sta-
tionary Hamiltonian H(x, y, λ), where λ = (λ1, . . . , λm) are some parameters. Ac-
cording to Gibbs [1], a distribution with the probability density

ρ = ce−βH ,

where c = const > 0, β = 1
kT (T is absolute temperature, k is Boltzmann constant)
plays a key role in statistical consideration of Hamiltonian systems. The constant c
is chosen due to the normalization condition of density ρ.

Given an invariant measure with the density (1), we can introduce an mean

energy

Hρ dnx dny,

(provided that the integrals (2) and (3) exist and depend smoothly on λ and β) there
can be associated a thermodynamic system with external parameters λ1, . . . , λm,
the internal energy (2), and the equations of state (3). The relations (2) and (3)

Thermodynamics of Billiards

Billiard is a mass particle performing the inertial motion in domain D of three-
dimensional Euclidean space and reﬂecting elastically from its boundary ∂D. We
can consider a more general case when there are n-identical particles in the domain D
not interacting with each other (in particular, not colliding with each other). Such
a system is a universally recognized model of rareﬁed perfect gas.

Let qi = (xi, yi, zi) be a set of Cartesian coordinates of the i-th particle of unit
mass with momentum pi = ( ˙xi, ˙yi, ˙zi). Dynamics of the system in the domain D is
deﬁned by a Hamiltonian

H =

p2
i
2

.

X
Since this function does not contain any information about the geometry of the
domain D, equations (2) and (3) are not applicable immediately. In this case, one
can apply the following procedure: statistical integral (5) is calculated ﬁrst, and
then relations (6) are used. In our case

Z =

e−βH d3p1 . . . d3pn d3q1 . . . d3qn =

where v is the volume of D. Therefore, the only external parameter λ is the volume v;
a conjugate variable Λ is the gas pressure p inside D. Taking into account (8),
from (6) we obtain known equations of a perfect gas

E =

kT ,

p =

.

Billiards, being systems with one-way constraints, are idealization of ordinary
mechanical systems with smooth Hamiltonians. When a particle hits the wall,
the wall deforms giving rise to great elastic forces which push the particle back
into D. These elastic forces are modeled by potential Vν(q).
It equals zero in D
and νf 2(q)
outside D. Here f is a smooth function that deﬁnes the boundary equa-
tion ∂D : f (q) = 0. The large constant ν plays a role of elasticity coeﬃcient. It is
assumed that the boundary does not contain critical points of the function f ; in par-
ticular, boundary ∂D is a smooth regular surface. As was shown in [2], as ν

solutions of a system with the Hamiltonian

tend to the motions of a system with elastic reﬂections in D.

Application of the Hamiltonian (10) gives corrections to the expression of statis-
tical integral which depend on the area σ of the boundary of D. Thus, the area σ
should be as an external parameter of the perfect gas as a thermodynamic system;
pressure will be the function of not only volume and temperature, but also of the
surface area of a vessel.

The meaning of the correction is that the volume v in (8) is replaced by

provided that f does not have critical points outside D. Taking this fact into ac-
count, the equation of internal energy E remains the same and the state equation (9)
is replaced by

Since σ is a new thermodinamical parameter, we should introduce a conjugate

variable

The relations (12) and (13) constitute a total system of the state equations.

Probability Distribution

Now a rigorous deduction of the Gibbs distribution is given only for the case of
vanishing interaction of individual subsystems. A classical Darwin-Fauler approach
represents an asymptotical (as n
) deduction of Gibbs distribution from the
general principles of dynamics in the assumption of the ergodic hypothesis. As it
is observed by A. Ya. Hinchin [5], this approach repeats in fact the previous mathe-
matical results, connected with the limiting probability theorems.

→ ∞

In [6] there suggested another deduction of distribution (1). It is based on the
fact that the probability density is a single-valued ﬁrst integral [1]. With the help
of Poincar´e method, the conditions, under which motion equations of interacting

4

subsystems do not admit integrals of C 2-class, independent of energy integral, are
indicated. These conditions are constructive and, obviously, less strong than the
assumption of ergodicity. Moreover, a natural Gibbs postulate about thermody-
namical equilibrum of subsystems under vanishing interaction is used in [6].

A statistical analogue of this argument is the deduction of a normal distribution,
suggested by Gauss. He does not use the central limiting theorem, but the postulate
that a sample mean is an estimate of maximum of probability at the ﬁnite number
of observations n

3 (see [7], [8]).

In connection with the above-said it is usefull to set in order the hierarchy of
Hamiltonian dynamical systems with respect to the degree of their arbitrariness.
Let us ﬁx the phase space P of dimention 2n
4 with analitical structure and
of all Hamiltonian systems on P with analytical
introduce into consideration a set
Hamiltonians. Certainly, it is supposed that the property of Hamiltonians to be
analitical on P is concordant with analytical structure of P itself.

ﬁrst instances of such transformations we cite the work by L. G. Shnirelman (1930)

cated area out of the four (see Figure 1). Identifying opposite sides, we will obtain

Classes of systems from (15) may be laid out into a wider class of systems,
which do not admit additional single-valued complex-analytic ﬁrst integrals. An
obstacle to the existence of single-valued holomorphic integrals is the branching of
the solutions of Hamiltonian systems in the plane of complex time. The discussion
of this range of questions one can ﬁnd in the work [13].

A

If we remain within the real examination, then the class

admits a natural
extension for the dynamics of natural machanical systems. They are decribed by the
Hamiltonians of the form H = T +V , where T is a kinetic energy, a positively deﬁned
quadratic form with respect to the momenta, and V is a potential energy, a function
on the conﬁguration space. All known integrals of such systems are polynomials in
momenta with single-valued, coeﬃcients on conﬁguration space, (or functions of such
polynomials). In analytical case, these coeﬃcients are also represented by analytical
functions. We can show that the existence of an additional polynomial integral of
the system with the Hamiltonian H = T + V is equivalent to the existence of an
integral of the system with the Hamiltonian H = T + εV (ε is a small parameter)
as the series in terms of powers of ε.

This problem is more simple and since Poincar´e times there have been proposed
eﬃcient methods for its solution [13]. The existence conditions of additional poly-

6

nomial integral of a plane billiard are obtained with the help of complex variable
function [14].

A

The issue of whether a certain Hamiltonian system belongs to the class

is more
complex. But essential advances have been made in this ﬁeld as well, especially for
the case with small number of degrees of freedom [13]. Diﬃculties become much
more severe as we move towards the beginning of the chain (15). Thus, according to
Kac [15], an eﬃcient veriﬁcation of the ergodic property of a dynamical system is a
nearly hopeless problem. Moreover, in many important cases, from the application
viewpoint, ergodic hypothesis is refuted by the results of KAM theory. For instance,
as it was established by Lazutkin [16], a billiard inside a plane convex curve (of C 2–
class of smoothness) is not ergodic. It does not even possess the transitive property.
Lack of ergodicity in spatial case was proved in [17] under some additional conditions.
These examples are directly related with the deduction of Gibbs distribution for the
perfect gas.

For small perturbation of an integrable Hamiltonian system with two degrees
of freedom, Kolmogorov tori cut a three-dimentional energy surfaces. Therefore, a
perturbed system can no longer be transitive. On the other hand, as it was noted by
Arnold, such systems admit a nonconstant continuous integral that takes constant
values in slits between Kolmogorov tori. It’s not quite clear yet whether such systems
have locally nonconstant continuous ﬁrst integrals which are not identically constant
in any neighbourhood of every point of the energy surface. A simpler problem
is whether perturbed systems of general kind with two degrees of freedom admit
nonconstant integrals of C 1–smoothness class.

≥

For systems with n

3 degrees of freedom, the slits between Kolmogorov tori
form a connected set everywhere densely ﬁlling a ﬁve–dimensional energy manifolds.
Therefore, a principal possibility of the appearance of transitive property arises. This
is one of the exact statements of the known hypothesis of diﬀusion in perturbated
multidimensional Hamiltonian systems. For the purpose of statistical mechanics
this diﬀusion hypothesis can be formulated in a less restricted fashion:
is it true
that under great n a perturbed Hamiltonian system of general form does not admit
nonconstant continuous (or even smooth, of C 1–class) ﬁrst integrals on (2n
1)-
dimensional energy surfaces? In fact, it is suﬃcient that this property appeared
under a small ﬁxed value of perturbing parameter ε and a great value of n of weakly
interacting subsystems.

Generalized entropy

Our observations described in previous Section result in a natural assumption that
the density of probability distribution ρ is a function of H. The question is: what
makes Gibbs distribution diﬀerent from all other distributions of this kind?

Let z

f (z) be a nonnegative real function of one variable, f ′ be its derivative.

assuming that the integral converges over the whole phase space. Here again β−1 =
kT . When f = ce−z, c = const
= 0, we shall obtain Gibbs distribution. We
could consider a more general case, when the function f depends also on external
parameters λ (as well as the Hamiltonian H). But we shall not follow this case.

Let us calculate an average energy E and generalized forces Λ using (2) and (3),
with density ρ determined by (16). Then we can compose 1-form of heat gain in
accordance with (4). Using direct calculations we can prove

The Perfect Gas

Let us apply relations from previous Section to the perfect gas inside domain D of the
three-dimentional Euclidean space; let v be the volume of D. Remembering that the
perfect gas is a totality of n equal and not interacting particles performing the inertial
motion inside D and reﬂecting elastically from its boundary ∂D. When taking into
account arbitrarily small interaction of particles, we will obtain a system without
additional integrals and therefore we can consider that the density of probability
distribution is a function of total energy. Let particle interaction tends to zero;
then we will obtain simple equations for average energy and state equations; these
equations deﬁne thermodynamics of a simpliﬁed system, i. e. the perfect gas. Let
particle mass be equal to unit. Hence, the Hamiltonian for the perfect gas will be
determined by the following equation

z)? The answer appears to be negative. Actually, (30)
and (31) are identical if

Let f be decreasing at inﬁnity faster than any exponential function. Then by part-

for all m+3 = 3n+1 = 4, 7, 10, . . .. If this equality was true for all non-negative m+
3, then according to classical momenta theory [18], the expression in the square
brackets of (33) would be equal to zero. Hence f ′ + f = 0 and, therefore, f =
ce−z, c = const. However, (33) is not valid for the “majority” of integer values
of m + 3. Hence, it follows that there is an inﬁnite-dimensional space of frequency
functions dependent on total energy only, which result in classical thermodynamical
relations for the perfect gas.

Abstract

It is demonstrated how the right hand sides of the Lorentz Transformation equa-
tions may be written, in a Lorentz invariant manner, as 4–vector scalar products.
The formalism is shown to provide a short derivation, in which the 4–vector elec-
tromagnetic potential plays a crucial role, of the Lorentz force law of classical elec-
trodynamics, and the conventional deﬁnition of the magnetic ﬁeld in terms spatial
derivatives of the 4–vector potential. The time component of the relativistic gen-
eralisation of the Lorentz force law is discussed. An important physical distinction
between the space-time and energy-momentum 4–vectors is also pointed out.

Introduction

Numerous examples exist in the literature of the derivation of electrodynamical equa-
tions from simpler physical hypotheses. In Einstein’s original paper on Special Relativ-
ity [1], the Lorentz force law was derived by performing a Lorentz transformation of the
electromagnetic ﬁelds and the space-time coordinates from the rest frame of an electron
(where only electrostatic forces act) to the laboratory system where the electron is in
motion and so also subjected to magnetic forces. A similar demonstration was given by
Schwartz [2] who also showed how the electrodynamical Maxwell equations can be derived
from the Gauss laws of electrostatics and magnetostatics by exploiting the 4-vector char-
acter of the electromagnetic current and the symmetry properties of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld tensor. The same type of derivation of electrodynamic Maxwell equations from the
electrostatic and magnetostatic ones has recently been performed by the present author
on the basis of ‘space-time exchange symmetry’ [3]. Frisch and Wilets [4] discussed the
derivation of Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz force law by application of relativistic
transforms to the electrostatic Gauss law. Dyson [5] published a proof, due originally to
Feynman, of the Faraday-Lenz law of induction, based on Newton’s Second Law and the
quantum commutation relations of position and momentum, that excited considerable
interest and a ﬂurry of comments and publications [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] about a decade
ago. Landau and Lifshitz [12] presented a derivation of Amp`ere’s Law from the electro-
dynamic Lagrangian, using the Principle of Least Action. By relativistic transformation
of the Coulomb force from the rest frame of a charge to another inertial system in rela-
tive motion, Lorrain, Corson and Lorrain [13] derived both the Biot-Savart law, for the
magnetic ﬁeld generated by a moving charge, and the Lorentz force law.

In many text books on classical electrodynamics the question of what are the funda-
mental physical hypotheses underlying the subject, as distinct from purely mathematical
developments of these hypotheses, used to derive predictions, is not discussed in any de-
tail. Indeed, it may even be stated that it is futile to address the question at all. For
example, Jackson [14] states:

At present it is popular in undergraduate texts and elsewhere to attempt to derive
magnetic ﬁelds and even Maxwell equations from Coulomb’s law of electrostatics and
the theory of Special Relativity. It should immediately obvious that, without additional
assumptions, this is impossible.’

This is, perhaps, a true statement. However, if the additional assumptions are weak
ones, the derivation may still be a worthwhile exercise. In fact, in the case of Maxwell’s
equations, as shown in References [2, 3], the ‘additional assumptions’ are merely the formal
deﬁnitions of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in terms of the space–time derivatives of the
4–vector potential [15]. In the case of the derivation of the Lorentz force equation given
below, not even the latter assumption is required, as the magnetic ﬁeld deﬁnition appears
naturally in the course of the derivation.

In the chapter on ‘The Electromagnetic Field’ in Misner Thorne and Wheeler’s book

‘Gravitation’ [16] can be found the following statement:

Here and elsewhere in science, as stressed not least by Henri Poincar´e, that view is

1

out of date which used to say, “Deﬁne your terms before you proceed”. All the laws and
theories of physics, including the Lorentz force law, have this deep and subtle chracter,
that they both deﬁne the concepts they use (here ~B and ~E) and make statements about
these concepts. Contrariwise, the absence of some body of theory, law and principle
deprives one of the means properly to deﬁne or even use concepts. Any forward step in
human knowlege is truly creative in this sense: that theory concept, law, and measurement
—forever inseperable—are born into the world in union.

I do not agree that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are the fundamental concepts
of electromagnetism, or that the Lorentz force law cannot be derived from simpler and
more fundamental concepts, but must be ‘swallowed whole’, as this passage suggests.
As demonstrated in References [2, 3] where the electrodynamic and magnetodynamic
Maxwell equations are derived from those of electrostatics and magnetostatics, a more
economical description of classical electromagentism is provided by the 4–vector potential.
Another example of this is provided by the derivation of the Lorentz force law presented
in the present paper. The discussion of electrodynamics in Reference [16] is couched
entirely in terms of the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor, F µν, and the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds which, like the Lorentz force law and Maxwell’s equations, are ‘parachuted’ into the
exposition without any proof or any discussion of their interrelatedness. The 4–vector
potential is introduced only in the next-but-last exercise at the end of the chapter. After
the derivation of the Lorentz force law in Section 3 below, a comparison will be made
with the treatment of the law in References [2, 14, 16].

The present paper introduces, in the following Section, the idea of an ‘invariant for-
mulation’ of the Lorentz Transformation (LT) [17]. It will be shown that the RHS of the
LT equations of space and time can be written as 4-vector scalar products, so that the
transformed 4-vector components are themselves Lorentz invariant quantities. Consid-
eration of particular length and time interval measurements demonstrates that this is a
physically meaningful concept. It is pointed out that, whereas space and time intervals
are, in general, physically independent physical quantities, this is not the case for the
space and time components of the energy-momentum 4-vector. In Section 3, a derivation
of the Lorentz force law, and the associated magnetic ﬁeld concept, is given, based on the
invariant formulation of the LT. The derivation is very short, the only initial hypothesis
being the usual deﬁnition of the electric ﬁeld in terms of the 4-vector potential, which, in
fact, is also uniquely speciﬁed by requiring the deﬁnition to be a covariant one. In Section
4 the time component of Newton’s Second Law in electrodynamics, obtained by applying
space-time exchange symmetry [3] to the Lorentz force law, is discussed.

Throughout this paper it is assumed that the electromagnetic ﬁeld constitutes, to-
gether with the moving charge, a conservative system; i.e. eﬀects of radiation, due to the
acceleration of the charge, are neglected

Invariant Formulation of the Lorentz Transforma-
tion

The space-time LT equations between two inertial frames S and S’, written in a space-

2

time symmetric manner, are:

(2.1)
(2.2)
(2.3)
(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)
(2.9)
(2.10)
(2.11)

(2.12)

The frame S’ moves with velocity, v, relative to S, along the common x-axis of S and S’.
β and γ are the usual relativistic parameters:

where c is the speed of light, and

≡
where t is the time recorded by an observer at rest in S. Clocks in S and S’ are synchronised,
i.e., t = t′ = 0, when the origins of the spatial cordinates of S and S’ coincide.

Eqns(2.1)-(2.4) give the relation between space and time intervals ∆x, ∆x0 = c∆t as

observed in the two frames:

∆x′0 = γ(∆x0

−

Each interval can be interpreted as the result of a particular measurement performed
in the appropriate frame. For example, ∆x may correspond to the measurement of the
distance between two points lying along the x-axis at a ﬁxed time in S. In virtue of this,
it may be identiﬁed with the space-like invariant interval, Sx, where:

Sx ≡ q−

(∆x0)2 + ∆x2 = ∆x

since, for the measurement procedure just described, ∆x0 = 0. Notice that ∆x is not
necessarily deﬁned in terms of such a measurement. If, following Einstein [1], the interval
∆x is associated with the length, ℓ, of a measuring rod at rest in S and lying parallel to the
x-axis, measurements of the ends of the rod can be made at arbitarily diﬀerent times in
S. The same result ℓ = ∆x will be found for the length of the rod, but the corresponding
invariant interval, Sx, as deﬁned by Eqn(2.12) will be diﬀerent in each case. Similarly,
∆x0 may be identiﬁed with the time-like invariant interval corresponding to successive
observations of a clock at a ﬁxed position (i.e. ∆x = 0) in S:

S0

(∆x0)2

∆x2 = ∆x0

(2.13)

−
The interval ∆x0 could also be measured by observing the diﬀerence of the times recorded
by a local clock and another, synchronised, one located at a diﬀerent position in S, after a
suitable correction for light propagation time delay. Each such pair of clocks would yield

≡ q

3

the same value, ∆x0, for the time diﬀerence between two events in S, but with diﬀerent
values of the invariant interval deﬁned by Eqn(2.13).

In virtue of Eqns(2.12) and (2.13) the LT equations (2.8) and (2.11) may be written

the following invariant form:

x =

0 = U(β)

where the following 4–vectors have been introduced:

≡

(S0; Sx, 0, 0) = (∆x0; ∆x, 0, 0)
(γ; γβ, 0, 0)
(γβ; γ, 0, 0)

The time-like 4-vector, U, is equal to V /c, where V is the usual 4–vector velocity, whereas
the space-like 4–vector, ¯U , is ‘orthogonal to U in four dimensions’:

U(β)

¯U (β) = 0

·

Since the RHS of (2.14) and (2.15) are 4–vector scalar products, S′
0 are manifestly
Lorentz invariant quantites. These 4–vector components may be deﬁned, in terms of
speciﬁc space-time measurements, by equations similar to (2.12) and (2.13) in the frame
S’. Note that the 4–vectors S and S′ are ‘doubly covariant’ in the sense that S
S and
S′
S′ are ‘doubly invariant’ quantities whose spatial and temporal terms are, individually,
Lorentz invariant:

Every term in Eqn(2.20) remains invariant if the spatial and temporal intervals described
above are observed from a third inertial frame S” moving along the x-axis relative to both
S and S’. This follows from the manifest Lorentz invariance of the RHS of Eqn(2.14) and
(2.15) and their inverses:

Since the LT Eqns(2.1) and (2.4) are valid for any 4–vector, W , it follows that:

x and W ′

Again, W ′
0 are manifestly Lorentz invariant. An interesting special case is the
energy-momentum 4–vector, P , of a physical object of mass, m. Here the ‘doubly in-
S in Eqn(2.20) is equal to m2c2. Choosing the x-axis
variant’ quantity analagous to S
parallel to ~p and β to correspond to the object’s velocity, so that S’ is the object’s proper
frame, and since P

Since the Lorentz transformation is determined by the single parameter, β, then it follows
from Eqns(2.25) and (2.26) that, unlike in the case of the space and time intervals in
Eqns(2.8) and (2.11), the spatial and temporal components of the energy momentum
4–vector, in an arbitary inertial frame, are not independent. In fact, P0 is determined
in terms of Px and m by the relation, that follows from the inverse of Eqns(2.25) and
x + m2c2. Thus, although the LT equations for the space-time and
P 2
(2.26): P0 =
energy-momentum 4–vectors are mathematically identical, the physical interpretation of
the transformed quantities is quite diﬀerent in the two cases.

q

The LT equation, (2.24), for the electromagnetic 4–vector potential, A, is found to
play a crucial role in the derivation of the Lorentz force law presented in the following
Section.

3 Derivation of the Lorentz force law and the Mag-

netic Field

In electrostatics, the electric ﬁeld, ~E, is customarily written in terms of the electrostatic
potential, φ, according to the equation ~E =
~
φ. The potential at a distance, r, from a
∇
−
point charge, Q, is given by Coulomb’s law φ(r) = Q/r. This, together with the equation
~F = q ~E, deﬁning the force, ~F , exerted on a charge, q, by the electric ﬁeld, completes the
speciﬁcation of the dynamical basis of classical electromagnetism.

It remains to generalise the above equation relating the electric ﬁeld to the electrostatic
potential in a manner consistent with special relativity. In relativistic notation [18], the
electric ﬁeld is related to the potential by the equation: Ei = ∂iA0, where φ is identiﬁed
with the time component, A0, of the 4–vector electromagnetic potential (A0; ~A). In order
to respect special relativity the electric ﬁeld must be deﬁned in a covariant manner, i.e.
in the same way in all inertial frames. The electrostatic law may be generalised in two
ways:

Ei

Ei
±

≡

∂iA0

(3.1)

This equation shows the only possiblities to deﬁne the electric ﬁeld in a way that respects
the symmetry with respect to the exchange of space and time coordinates that is a general
property of all special relativistic laws [3]. Choosing i = 1 in Eqn(3.1) and transforming
all quantities on the RHS into the S’ frame, by use of the inverses of Eqns(2.1) and (2.4),
leads to the following expressions for the 1–component of the electric ﬁeld in S, in terms
of quantites deﬁned in S’:

E1

± = γ2(1

E1 = ∂′1A′0

∂′0A′1 = E′1

Which expresses the well-known invariance of the longitudinal component of the electric
ﬁeld under the LT.

Thus, from rotational invariance, the general covariant deﬁnition of the electric ﬁeld

is:

Ei = ∂iA0

∂0Ai

−

This is the ‘additional assumption’, mentioned by Jackson in the passage quoted above,
that is necessary, in the present case, to derive the Lorentz force law. However, as written,
it concerns only the physical properties of the electric ﬁeld: the magnetic ﬁeld concept
has not yet been introduced. A further a posteriori justiﬁcation of Eqn(3.4) will be given
after derivation of the Lorentz force law. Here it is simply noted that, if the spatial part
of the 4–vector potential is time-independent, Eqn(3.4) reduces to the usual electrostatic
deﬁnition of the electric ﬁeld.

The force ~F ′ on an electric charge q at rest in the frame S’ is given by the deﬁnition

of the electric ﬁeld, and Eqn(3.4) as:

Equations analagous to (2.24) may be written relating A′ and ∂′ to the corresponding
quantities in the frame S moving along the x’ axis with velocity

v relative to S’:

F ′i = q

This equation expresses a linear relationship between F ′i, ∂′i and A′i. Since the coeﬃcients
of the relation are Lorentz invariant, the same formula is valid in any inertial frame, in
particular, in the frame S. Hence:

This equation gives, in 4–vector notation, a spatial component of the Lorentz force on the
charge q in the frame S, and so completes the derivation.

To express the Lorentz force formula in the more familiar 3-vector notation, it is

convenient to introduce the relativistic generalisation of Newton’s Second Law [19]:

dP
dτ

= F

where F is the 4-vector force and τ = t′ is the proper time (in S’) that is related to the
time t in S by the relativistic time dilatation formula: dt = γdτ . This gives, with Eqn(3.9)
and (3.10):

where Eqn(3.12) has been used. Eqn(3.15) is just the Faraday-Lenz induction law, i.e. the
magnetodynamic Maxwell equation. This is only apparent, however, once the ‘magnetic
ﬁeld’ concept of Eqn(3.12) has been introduced. Thus the initial hypothesis, Eqn(3.4), is
actually a Maxwell equation. This is the a posteriori justiﬁcation, mentioned above, for
this covariant deﬁnition of the electric ﬁeld.

It is common in discussions of electromagnetism to introduce the second rank electro-

magnetic ﬁeld tensor, F µν according to the deﬁnition:

From the point of view adopted in the present paper both the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor
and the electric and magnetic ﬁelds themselves are auxiliary quantities introduced only
for mathematical convenience, in order to write the equations of electromagnetism in a
compact way. Since all these quantities are completly deﬁned by the 4–vector potential,
it is the latter quantity that encodes all the relevant physical information on any electro-
dynamic problem [21]. This position is contrary to that commonly taken in the literature
and texbooks where it is often claimed that only the electric and magnetic ﬁelds have
physical signiﬁcance, while the 4–vector potential is only a convenient mathematical tool.
For example R¨ohrlich [22] makes the statement:

These functions (φ and ~A) known as potentials have no physical meaning and are

introduced solely for the purpose of mathematical simpliﬁcation of the equations.

In fact, as shown above (compare Eqns(3.11) and (3.13)) it is the introduction of the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds that enable the Lorentz force equation to be written in a simple

7

manner! In other cases (e.g. Maxwell’s equations) simpler expessions may be written in
terms of the 4–vector potential. The quantum theory, quantum electrodynamics, that
underlies classical electromagnetism, requires the introduction the 4–vector photon ﬁeld
µ in order to specify the minimal interaction that provides the dynamical basis of the
A
theory. Similarly, the introduction of Aµ is necessary for the Lagrangian formulation of
classical electromagnetism. It makes no sense, therefore, to argue that a physical concept
of such fundamental importance has ‘no physical meaning’.

The initial postulate used here to derive the Lorentz force law is Eqn(3.4), which
contains, explicitly, the electrostatic force law and, implicitly, the Faraday-Lenz induction
law. The actual form of the electrostatic force law (Coulomb’s inverse square law) is not
invoked, suggesting that the Lorentz force law may be of greater generality. On the
assumption of Eqn(3.4) (which has been demonstrated to be the only possible covariant
deﬁnition of the electric ﬁeld), the existence of the ‘magnetic ﬁeld’, the ‘electromagnetic
ﬁeld tensor’, and ﬁnally the Lorentz force law itself have all been derived, without further
assumptions, by use of the invariant formulation of the Lorentz transformation.

It is instructive to compare the derivation of the Lorentz force law given in the present
paper with that of Reference [13] based on the relativistic transformation properties of the
Coulomb force 3–vector. Coulomb’s law is not used in the present paper. On the other
hand, Reference [13] makes no use of the 4–vector potential concept, which is essential for
the derivation presented here. This demonstrates an interesting redundancy among the
fundamental physical concepts of classical electromagnetism.

In Reference [2], Eqns(3.4), (3.12) and (3.16) were all introduced as a priori initial
postulates without further justiﬁcation. In fact, Schwartz gave the following explanation
for his introduction of Eqn(3.16) [23]:

So far everything we have done has been entirely deductive, making use only of
Coulomb’s law, conservation of charge under Lorentz transformation and Lorentz in-
variance for our physical laws. We have now come to the end of this deductive path. At
this point when the laws were being written, God had to make a decision.
In general
there are 16 components of a second-rank tensor in four dimensions. However, in anal-
ogy to three dimensions we can make a major simpliﬁcation by choosing the completely
antisymmetric tensor to represent our ﬁeld quantities. Then we would have only 6 inde-
pendent components instead of the possible 16. Under Lorentz transformation the tensor
would remain antisymmetric and we would never have need for more than six independent
components. Appreciating this, and having a deep aversion to useless complication, God
naturally chose the antsymmetric tensor as His medium of expression.

Actually it is possible that God may have previously invented the 4–vector potential
and special relativity, which lead, as shown above, to Eqn(3.4) as the only possible co-
variant deﬁnition of the electric ﬁeld. As also shown in the present paper, the existence of
the remaining elements of the antisymmetric ﬁeld tensor, containing the magnetic ﬁeld,
then follow from special relativity alone. Schwartz derived the Lorentz force law, as in
Einstein’s original Special Relativity paper [1], by Lorentz transformation of the electric
ﬁeld, from the rest frame of the test charge, to one in which it is in motion. This requires
that the magnetic ﬁeld concept has previously been introduced as well as knowledge of
the Lorentz transformation laws of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

8

In the chapter devoted to special relativity in Jackson’s book [24] the Lorentz force
law is simply stated, without any derivation, as are also the deﬁning equations of the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds and the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor just mentioned. No
emphasis is therefore placed on the fundamental importance of the 4–vector potential in
the relativistic description of electromagnetism.

In order to treat, in a similar manner, the electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds, the
discussion in Misner Thorne and Wheeler [16] is largely centered on the properties of the
tensor F µν. Again the Lorentz force equation is introduced, in the spirit of the passage
quoted above, without any derivation or discussion of its meaning. The deﬁning equations
of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds and F µν, in terms of Aµ, appear only in the eighteenth
exercise of the relevant chapter. The main contents of the chapter on the electromagnetic
ﬁeld are an extended discussion of purely mathematical tensor manipulations that obscure
the essential simplicity of electromagnetism when formulated in terms of the 4–vector
potential.

In contrast to References [2, 24, 16], in the derivation of the Lorentz force law and
the magnetic ﬁeld presented here, the only initial assumption, apart from the validity
of special relativity, is the chosen deﬁnition, Eqn(3.4), of the electric ﬁeld in terms of
the 4–vector potential Aµ, which is the only covariant one. Thus, a more fundamental
description of electromagnetism than that provided by the electric and magnetic ﬁeld
concepts is indeed possible, contrary to the opinion expressed in the passage from Misner
Thorne and Wheeler quoted above.

4 The time component of Newton’s Second Law in

Electrodynamics

Space-time exchange symmetry [3] states that physical laws in ﬂat space are invariant
with respect to the exchange of the space and time components of 4-vectors. For example,
the LT of time, Eqn(2.4), is obtained from that for space, Eqn(2.1), by applying the space-
x′. In the present case, application of
x, x′
time exchange (STE) operations: x0
0
the STE operation to the spatial component of the Lorentz force equation in the second
line of Eqn(3.11) leads to the relation:

Integration of Eqn(4.5) gives the equation of energy conservation for a particle moving
from an initial position, ~xI , to a ﬁnal position, ~xF , under the inﬂuence of electromagnetic
forces:

~β

Thus work is done on the moving charge only by the electric ﬁeld. This is also evident from
~B is perpendicular to the
the Lorentz force equation, (3.14), since the magnetic force
velocity vector, so that no work is performed by the magnetic ﬁeld. A corollary is that
the relativistic energy (and hence the magnitude of the velocity) of a charged particle
moving in a constant magnetic ﬁeld is a constant of the motion. Of course, Eqn(4.5)
may also be derived directly from the Lorentz force law, so that the time component of
the relativistic generalisation of Newton’s Second Law, Eqn(4.1), contains no physical
information not already contained in the spatial components. This is related to the fact
that, as demonstrated in Eqns(2.25) and (2.26), the spatial and temporal components of
the energy-momentum 4–vector are not independent physical quantities.

I should like to thank O.L. de Lange for asking the question whose answer, presented
in Section 4, was the original motivation for the writing of this paper, and an anonymous
referee of an earlier version of this paper for informing me of related material, in the
books of Jackson and Misner, Thorne and Wheeler, which is discussed in some detail in
this version.

[15] Actually, a careful examination of the derivation of Amp`ere’s from the Gauss law
of electrostatics in Reference[3] shows that, although Eqn(3.4) of the present paper
is a necessary initial assumption, the deﬁnition of the magnetic ﬁeld in terms of
the spatial derivatives of the 4–vector potential occurs naturally in the course of the
derivation (see Eqns(5.16) and (5.17) of Reference[3]) so it is not necessary to assume,
at the outset, the expression for the spatial components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
tensor as given by Eqn(5.1) of Reference[3].

[17] This should not be confused with a manifestly covariant expression for the LT, where
it is written as a linear 4-vector relation with Lorentz-invariant coeﬃcients, as in:

[21] The explicit form of Aµ, as derived from Coulomb’s law, is given in standard text-
books on classical electrodynamics. For example, in Reference[13], it is to be found
in Eqns(17-51) and (17-52). Aµ is actually proportional to the 4-vector velocity, V ,
of the charged particle that is the source of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

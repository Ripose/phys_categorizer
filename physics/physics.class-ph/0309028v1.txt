Abstract. The expression for the Coulomb-gauge vector potential in terms of the ‘instantaneous’
magnetic ﬁeld derived by Stewart [2003 Eur. J. Phys. 24 519] by employing Jeﬁmenko’s equation
for the magnetic ﬁeld and Jackson’s formula for the Coulomb-gauge vector potential can be
obtained immediately by just using the Helmholtz theorem.

In a recent article [1], Stewart has derived the following expression for the Coulomb-gauge
vector potential AC in terms of the ‘instantaneous’ magnetic ﬁeld B:

AC(r, t) =

∇

4π

×

Z

d3r′

B(r′, t)
|r − r′|

.

His derivation consists of substituting in (1) Jeﬁmenko’s expression for the magnetic ﬁeld in
terms of the retarded current density and its partial time derivative [2], and then obtaining,
after some non-trivial algebra, an expression for AC in terms of the current density derived
recently by Jackson [3].

Stewart has used the Helmholtz theorem as a starting point of his derivation, to provide
a ‘suggestion’ that (1) is true. In this comment, we show that there is no need to go beyond
a simple application of this theorem in order to prove formula (1).

According to the Helmholtz theorem [4], an arbitrary-gauge vector potential A, as any
three-dimensional vector ﬁeld whose divergence and curl vanish at inﬁnity, can be decom-
posed uniquely into a longitudinal part Ak, whose curl vanishes, and a transverse part A⊥,
whose divergence vanishes:

A(r, t) = Ak(r, t) + A⊥(r, t) ∇×Ak(r, t) = 0 ∇·A⊥(r, t) = 0.

The longitudinal and transverse parts in (2) are given explicitly by

Ak(r, t) = −

∇′·A(r′, t)

A⊥(r, t) =

Let us now decompose the vector potential A in terms of the Coulomb-gauge vector

potential AC as follows:

A(r, t) = [A(r, t) − AC(r, t)] + AC(r, t).

(4)

If the curl of [A − AC] vanishes, then, according to equation (2) and the fact that the
Coulomb-gauge vector potential is by deﬁnition divergenceless, the Coulomb-gauge vector
potential AC is the transverse part A⊥ of the vector potential A. But because the two
vector potentials must yield the same magnetic ﬁeld, the curl of [A − AC] does vanish:

∇×[A(r, t) − AC(r, t)] = ∇×A(r, t) − ∇×AC(r, t) = B(r, t) − B(r, t) = 0.

(5)

Thus the Coulomb-gauge vector potential is indeed the transverse part of the vector potential
A of any gauge. Therefore, it can be expressed according to the second part of (3) and the
fact that ∇ × A = B as

AC(r, t) = A⊥(r, t) =

The right-hand side of (6) is the expression (1) derived by Stewart.

There is an expression for the Coulomb-gauge scalar potential VC in terms of the ‘in-
stantaneous’ electric ﬁeld E that is analogous to the expression (6) for the Coulomb-gauge
vector potential:

VC(r, t) =

This follows directly from the deﬁnition VC(r, t) =
gauge scalar potential and the Maxwell equation ∇ · E = 4πρ. The expressions (6) and (7)
may be regarded as a ‘totally instantaneous gauge’, but it would seem more appropriate to
view them as the solution to a problem that is inverse to that of calculating the electric and
magnetic ﬁelds from given Coulomb-gauge potentials AC and VC according to

B = ∇ × AC.

In closing, we note that the ﬁrst equation of (8) gives directly the longitudinal part Ek
and transverse part E⊥ of an electric ﬁeld E in terms of the Coulomb-gauge potentials VC
and AC as Ek = −∇VC and E⊥ = −∂AC/c∂t (the apparent paradox that the longitudinal
part Ek of a retarded electric ﬁeld E is thus an instantaneous ﬁeld has been discussed
recently in [5]).

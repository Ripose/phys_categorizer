Abstract

In this paper, we investigate the similarity solutions for a steady laminar incompressible boundary
layer equations governing the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) ﬂow near the forward stagnation point of
two-dimensional and axisymmetric bodies. This leads to the study of a boundary value problem involving
a third order autonomous ordinary diﬀerential equation. Our main results are the existence, uniqueness
and nonexistence for concave or convex solutions.

Introduction

Boundary layer ﬂow of an electrically conducting ﬂuid over moving surfaces emerges in a large variety of
industrial and technological applications. It has been investigated by many researchers, Wu [1] has studied
the eﬀects of suction or injection on a steady two-dimensional MHD boundary layer ﬂow on a ﬂat plate,
Takhar et al.
[2] studied a MHD asymmetric ﬂow over a semi-inﬁnite moving surface and numerically
obtained the solutions. An analysis of heat and mass transfer characteristics in an electrically conducting
ﬂuid over a linearly stretching sheet with variable wall temperature was investigated by Vajravelu and
Rollins [3]. In [4] Muhapatra and Gupta treated the steady two-dimensional stagnation-point ﬂow of an
incompressible viscous electrically conducting ﬂuid towards a stretching surface, the ﬂow being permeated
by a uniform transverse magnetic ﬁeld. For more details see also [5], [6], [7], [8] and the references therein.
Motivated by the above works, we aim here to give analytical results about the third order non-linear
autonomous diﬀerential equation

The case M = m = 0 is refereed to the Blasius equation introduced in [16] and studied by several authors
(see for example [17],[18],[19]). Recently, the case m =
1 have been studied in [20] the authors show
existence of ”pseudo-similarity” solution, provided that the plate is permeable with suction. Mention
may be made also to [21], where the authors show existence of an inﬁnite number of similarity solutions
for the case of a non-Newtonian ﬂuid.

2 Flow analysis

Let us suppose that an electrically conducting ﬂuid (with electrical conductivity σ) in the presence of a
transverse magnetic ﬁeld B(x) is ﬂowing past a ﬂat plate stretched with a power-law velocity. According
to [20],[23],[24], such phenomenon is described by the following equations

−

Here, the induced magnetic ﬁeld is neglected. In a cartesian system of co-ordinates (O, x, y), the variables
u and v are the velocity components in the x and y directions respectively. We will denote by ue(x) =
γxm, γ > 0 the external velocity, B(x) = B0x
the applied magnetic ﬁeld, m the power-law velocity
exponent, ρ the ﬂuid density and ν the kinematic viscosity.
The boundary conditions for problem (5)-(6) are

m−1

u(x, 0) = uw(x) = αxm,

v(x, 0) = vw(x) = βx

m−1

,

u(x,

) = ue(x)

∞

(7)

where uw(x) and vw(x) are the stretching and the suction (or injection) velocity respectively and α, β
are constants. Recall that α > 0 is referred to the suction, α < 0 for the injection and α = 0 for the
impermeable plate.
A little inspection shows that equations (5) and (6) accompanied by conditions (7) admit a similarity
solution. Therefore, we introduce the dimensional stream function ψ in the usual way to get the following
equation

First, we give the following

Remark 1 Let b = 1, then the function f (t) = t + a is a solution of the problem (1)-(2) for any
values of m and M in R. We cannot say much about the uniqueness of the previous solution, but if
g is another solution with g′′(0) = γ > 0 then, since g′(0) = g′(

Suppose now that f veriﬁes the equation (1) only. We will now establish some estimations for the possible
extremals of f ′.

Proposition 3.1 Let f be a solution of the equation (1) and t0 be a minimum for f ′ (i.e. f ′′(t0) = 0
and f ′′′(t0)

Remark 2 A consequence of the previous Theorem is that, for m = 0 and M > 0 all the solutions of
the problem (1)-(2) have to be concave or convex everywhere.

In this section we will ﬁrst prove that, under some hypotheses, the problem (1)-(2) admits a unique
concave solution or a unique convex solution for m >

about the concave or convex solutions for m

In this paper, we have shown the existence of a unique concave or a unique convex solution of the problem
R
(1)-(2) for m >
and related values of M , as well as some clues about the possible behavior of f ′. This paper is a ﬁrst work
on this problem, there is still much left to do because of its complexity. Notice that the case M =
2m
plays a particular role in the problem (1)-(2), because it is the only one for which we are able to predict
the possible changes of concavity for f . Its study will be the subject of a forthcoming paper.

Propagation of sound beam diﬀracted from a circular aperture in far-ﬁeld region has been studied
in this paper by the method of angular spectrum representation and stationary phase method. This
nonparaxial theory is useful when beam angle is not very small and the wavelength λ is comparable
to aperture diameter a unlike the situation in paraxial approximation. Here we have studied two
cases, one for a Gaussian source and other for a plane piston source.

INTRODUCTION

which when substituted in Eq.1 yields

Pressure ﬁeld radiation and diﬀraction from a source
with a circular aperture and its propagation through elas-
tic medium is quite well known and a well studied subject
in acoustics[2],[5],[6]. Paraxial approximation has been
successfully applied [5] to study such phenomena. This
approximation neglects ∂2P
∂z2 term (the second derivative
of pressure with respect to propagation axial co-ordinate)
in the Helmholtz equation, as the term is of higher order
θ). But
in beam angle θ which is very small (sin θ
when θ is not so small, paraxial approximation is no
longer valid. Some good works has already been done in
optics in such nonparaxial correction [3],[4],[8]. But, in
acoustics, such work is still missing. This paper concen-
trates on the propagation of the acoustic beam transmit-
ted from a monochromatic source from a circular aper-
ture in nonparaxial far-ﬁeld zone, through a compara-
tively general approach employing the angular spectrum
distribution and the stationary phase method. Gaussian
and plane piston are taken as the initial source. The pa-
per begins with a discussion of an analytic nonparaxial
formalism with analytical results. This is followed by a
presentation of numerical results. Discussions with con-
clusions are the ﬁnal feature of this paper.

In any plane z = constant, let us assume the ﬁeld can be
represented by a Fourier integral as

B(u, v)e−ik(ux+vy+wz)dudv (7)

If we don’t consider reﬂection mode, then B(u, v) = 0
(soft baﬄe case). Otherwise for rigid baﬄe, the pressure
will be doubled due to reﬂection. So

Aperture diameter has been taken as 3.175mm. Velocity

tances that has been taken to compute the ﬁeld is 10ZR,
where ZR is Rayleigh distance deﬁned as ZR = πa2
λ . The
axial distances are 105.5641mm and 1055.6mm for f1

V. DISCUSSION

An analytical method has been proposed to investigate
sound beams beyond paraxial regime. Angular spectrum
representation and method of stationary phase are the
two mathematical tools used. The analytical study and
ﬁnal results are for a general situation in far-ﬁeld zone.
Paraxial results can be obtained as the special cases of
those results. Eq.(26) is the general nonparaxial solu-
tion for Gaussian source whereas Eq.(28) is its paraxial
form. Similarly for the case of plane piston type source,
Eq.(30) is the general nonparaxial solution and Eq.(31)
is its paraxial form. Fig.(2) and Fig.(3) are the plots
of the comparative numerical results for Gaussian and
plane piston sources respectively. In Fig.2(a), nonparax-
ial and paraxial results diﬀer. Although the maxima is
same for nonparaxial and paraxial values, but the spread
is diﬀerent. But as a
λ increases [Fig.2(b)], this diﬀerence
diminishes. Similar result has been shown in Fig(3), i.e
the results for plane piston source. We conclude that the
analytical results presented here represents a generaliza-
tion of propagation of sound beam diﬀracted from cir-
cular aperture in far-ﬁeld zone. Not only generalization,
but a signiﬁcant correction over paraxial approximation
too.

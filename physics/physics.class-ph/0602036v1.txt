1. INTRODUCTION

one sees apparently deep connections between physics and information the-
ory, which theme was enunciated many years ago by B. Frieden [24], J.A.
Wheeler, and others.

2. DEDONDER-WEYL THEORY

We begin with a sketch of the deDonder-Weyl theory and some applica-
tions following [14, 42, 43, 54, 55, 56] (cf. also [32, 37, 38, 39, 50, 52, 67, 74]).
First from [42, 43] we give some information and discussion of deDonder-
Weyl (dDW) theory. Recall that the dDW formula for the classical Euler-
Lagrange (EL) equations takes the form

(2.1)

∂pi

∂xi =

; H = pi

The (manifest) covariance simply means that space and time variables enter
the theory on a completely equal footing. The HJ equation of dDW theory
is (2A) ∂µSµ + H(ya, pµ
a = ∂Sµ/∂ya) = 0 and the functional HJ equation
of the canonical formalism is

(2.2)

∂tS + H

y(x), π(x) =

δS

Then in [43] one writes for Σ a Cauchy surface, Σ(y = y(x), t = constant)

We recall now that canonical ﬁeld quantization for say L = (1/2)∂µy∂µy

The equation for Sµ
|Σ can be obtained from the dDW HJ equation by
noticing that when acting on Sµ
|Σ the spatial derivative ∂i turns into the
total derivative (d/dxi) = ∂i + ∂iy(x)∂y, the last term of which should
be compensated. Thus the equation for Sµ

The second term under the integral does not contribute since it is a total
divergence (this point may need further clariﬁcation in some gravitional
models). The third and forth terms together lead to (1/2)(∂iy(x))2 because
in dDW theory ∂ySi = pi and for a scalar ﬁeld pi
∂iy(x). We have
therefore obtained the functional HJ equation (10.8) as a consequence of
the dDW HJ equation (10.7) restricted to the Cauchy surface Σ and a
natural hypothesis (10.3) on relating the HJ eikonal functional S to the
dWD eikonal functions Smu.

3. COVARIANT QFT

One shows here following [54, 55, 56, 57] that the deterministic evolution
of quantum ﬁelds is a covariant version of the Bohmian hidden variable
interpretation of quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT). The deDonder-Weyl (dDW)
covariant canonical formalism is exploited in a novel manner and a co-
variant Bohmian formulation is not postulated but derived; this suggests
that the Bohmian interpretation could be the missing link between QM
and GR. The dDW formalism treats space and time variables on an equal
footing. Thus given a Lagrangian L(ya, ∂µya, xν) with ﬁeld variables ya

The ﬁelds are treated as a multitime dDW system evolving in space and
time (not just in time) and everything is manifestly covariant. Conse-
quently this is an ideal framework for quantum gravity. Following now [54]
(cf. also [14]) one writes (using only one ﬁeld φ for illustration)

ﬁeld φ(x, t) is now given via (3B) ∂tφ(x, t) = δS/δφ(x, t) (from the time
component in (3.4)) and one notes that in deriving (3.7) it was necessary to
use the space part of the equations of motion in (3.4); this will be important
in the quantum extension below.

We recall that QFT can be formulated in the Schr¨odinger picture via

and this represents the unitarity of the theory since it provides a norm
[dφ(x)]R2 that does not depend on time (some argu-
(3D)
ment is needed here). One must also stipulate that the quantity exp(iS/~)
be single valued. This formulation also suggests an interesting Bohmian in-
terpretation stating that the quantum ﬁelds have a deterministic time evo-
lution given by the classical equation (3B) and the statistical predictions
[14, 54]
will be equivalent to those of the conventional interpretation (cf.
for discussion). Comparing now (3.9) with (3.7) we see that the quantum
ﬁeld satisﬁes an equation similar to the classical one except for the addi-
tional nonlocal quantum potential Q. There are no contradictions here with
the Bell theory (which speciﬁes local hidden variables) and the quantum
equation of motion will be

We will now need a covariant version of the Bohm theory which goes
as follows. One wants ﬁrst a quantum version of the classical covariant
dDW HJ equation in (3.5) and one formulates the classical version ﬁrst
in a somewhat diﬀerent way. Thus let A([φ], x) be a functional of φ and
d4x′(δA([φ], x′)/δφ(x))
a function of x; deﬁne then (3C) dA/dφ(x) =
where δ/δφ(x) is a spacetime functional derivative. If A([φ], x) = A(φ(x), x)

R

d4x′(δA(φ(x′), x′)/δφ(x)) =
(local functional) then dA([φ], x)/dφ(x) =
∂A(φ(x), x)/∂φ(x). An example of particular interest here is a functional
nonlocal in space but local in time so that

which is appropriate for the quantum modiﬁcation. Similarly the classical
equations of motion in (3.4) can be written as (3D) ∂µφ = dSµ/dφ. This
leads now to the quantum analogue of the classical covariant equation,
namely

1

dSµ

dSµ
dφ

+ V + Q + ∂µSµ = 0

(cf. [62]). Here (3.14) is manifestly covariant provided that Q in (3.9) can
be written in a covariant form (see below for this). One can then show
that (3.14) implies (3.9) provided S0 is local in time (so that (3.12) can be
used - cf. (3.6)) and Si must be completely local so that dSi/dφ = ∂Si/∂φ
and hence diSi = ∂iSi + (∂iφ)(dSi/dφ) (cf. (3.4)). Thus in the covariant
quantum theory based on the dDW formalism one must require the valid-
ity of (bf 3D) and this is nothing but a covariant version of the Bohmian
equations of motion written for an arbitrarily nonlocal Sµ. To produce co-
variant versions of the remaining terms in (3.9) introduce a vector Rµ([φ], x)
which generates a preferred foliation of spacetime with Rµ normal to the
Σ dΣµRµ where
leaves of the foliation. Then introduce (3E) R([φ], Σ) =
Σ is a 3-D leaf generated by Rµ. Similarly a covariant version of S is
Σ dΣµSµ with Σ again generated by Rµ. The covariant
(3F) S([φ], Σ) =
version of (3C) is then (3G) ψ([φ], Σ) = R([φ], Σ)exp(iS([φ], Σ)/~) and
R
for Rµ one postulates the equation

+ J + ∂µRµ = 0

In this manner a preferred foliation emerges dynamically as a foliation
generated by the solution Rµ of (3.15) and (3.14). Note that Rµ plays no
classical role and the existence of a preferred foliation is a purely quantum
eﬀect. Now the relation betweeen (3.15) and (3.9) is obtained by assuming
that nature has chosen a solution of the form Rµ = (R0, 0, 0, 0) where R0
is local in time and by integration of (3.15) over d3x with S0 local one

sees that (3.15) is truely a covariant substitute for (3.9). Finally one has
covariant versions of Q and J in the form

Q =

where δ/δΣφ(x) is a version of (3.6) in which Σ is generated by Rµ. Here
Σ depends on x (x
Σ) and Σ is kept ﬁxed in the variation δΣφ(x). Thus
(3.14)-(3.15) with (3.16) represent a covariant substitute for the functional
SE (3.8) equivalent to (3.9). The covariant Bohmian equations (3D) imply
a covariant version of (3.11), namely

In [17] we sketched some new heuristic results concerning WDW and

exact uncertainty following [14, 33, 34, 35, 73].

[11, 14, 16]) that the relation between the SE and
the quantum potential (QP) is not 1-1. The QP Q depends on the wave
function ψ = Rexp(iS/~) via Q =
(~2/2)(∆R/R) for the SE and thus
−
the solution of a quantum HJ equation, involving S and R(via Q), requires
the companion “continuity” equation to determine S and R (and thence
ψ). There is some lack of uniqueness since Q determines R only up to
uniqueness for solutions of ∆R + (2m/~2)QR = 0 and even then the HJ
equation St +
= 0 could introduce still another arbitrary function (cf.
[14, 16]).
THEOREM 4.1. Given that any quantum potential for the SE has the
form (4.2) (with
P = 0 on ∂Ω) it follows that the quantization can be
identiﬁed with momentum ﬂuctuations of the type studied in [35] and thus
has information content as described by the Fisher information. Thus we

see that given a SE described via a probability distribution P (=
|
one can identify this equation as a quantum model arising from a classical
Hamiltonian ˜Hcl perturbed by a Fisher information term as in (4.4). Thus
the quantization involves an information content with entropy signiﬁcance
(cf. here [15, 59]) for entropy connections). This suggests that any quanti-
zation of ˜Hcl arises (or can arise) through momentum perturbations related
P d3x = 1)
to Fisher information and it also suggests that P =
should be deemed a requirement for any solution ψ of the related SE (note
P d3x = 1 eliminates many putative counterexamples). Thus once P is
speciﬁed as a probability distribution for a wave function ψ = √P exp(iS/~)
R
arising from a SE corresponding to a quantization of ˜Hcl, then Q can be
expressed via Fisher information. Similarly given Q as a Fisher informa-
tion perturbation of ˜Hcl (arising from momentum ﬂuctuations involving P
as in (4.4)) there is a unique wave function ψ = √P exp(iS/~) satisfying
the corresponding SE.

THEOREM 4.2. Given a WDW equation of the form (4.9) with asso-
ciated quantum potential given via (4.15) (or (4.16)) it follows that the
quantum potential can be expressed via momentum ﬂuctuations as in (4.8)
(for N = 1). Thus let us assume there exists a suitable Df as in Section
4.3 below which is a measure in the (super)space of ﬁelds h. Then there
is an integration by parts formula (4.20) which removes the need for con-
sidering surface terms in integrals
[20] for cautionary remarks
about Green’s theorem, etc.). Consequently given a WDW equation of the
R
form (4.9) with corresponding Q as in (4.15) (and ψ = √P exp(iS/~), one
can show that the equation can be modelled on a perturbation of a clas-
sical ˜Hc via a Fisher information type perturbation as in (4.8) (cf. here
[14, 15, 17, 24, 34]). Here P represents a probability density of ﬁelds hij
which determine Gijkℓ (and V incidentally) and the very existence of a
quantum equation (i.e. WDW) seems to require entropy type input via
Fisher information ﬂuctuation of ﬁelds. This suggests that quantum grav-
ity requires a statistical spacetime (an idea that has appeared before - cf.
[14]).

REMARK 4.1. We note from [5, 23, 29, 93] that the “superspace”
= Riem/Dif f with the deWitt metric Gijkℓ = Gkℓij is a collection of
manifolds called a stratiﬁed manifold with dim(isom(δij )) = 6 whereas in
fact dim(isom(generic hij)) = 0. Hence the calculations involving Dh here
(cid:4)
(as well as in [33, 34]) must be regarded heuristically.

4.3. SOME FUNCTIONAL CALCULUS. We go here to [12, 14, 34,
36] and will ﬁrst sketch the derivation of (3.4) following [33, 34] (cf. also
[14]). The relevant functional calculus goes as follows. One deﬁnes a func-

In the Hamiltonian theory one can work with a generating function S such
that (4M) g = δS/δf and ∂tS +H(f, δS/δf, t) = 0 (HJ equation) and solv-
ing this is equivalent to ∂tf = δH/δg and ∂tg =
δH/δf (cf. [34]). Once S
is speciﬁed the momentum density g is determinied via g = δS/δf and an
ensemble of ﬁelds is speciﬁed by a probability density functional P [f ] (and
not by a phase space density functionalρ[f.g]. In the HJ formulation one
writes (4N) Vx[f ] = ∂fx/∂t = (δH/δg)

(4.27)

˜H = ˜H[P, S, t] =< H >=

THEOREM 5.1. Given the covariant QFT formulation of Section 3 and
assuming only metric ﬂuctuations satisfying (5.4) one can deﬁne a (“cos-
mic” diﬀerential) entropy (5A) and express the Fisher information (ex-
pressed via the quantum potential Q) as a time derivative ∂tS

.

REMARK 5.1. In [13] one develops a theory of a time direction hidden
in quantum mechanics based on Q(t) > 0 where Q is the quantum potential.
t Q(τ )dτ is a monotone increasing function of time which
The idea is that
can be useful to characterize the direction of time. We will not go into the
idea of a knowledge functional
Q (up
to a factor of ~2/2). In any event this also seems to be compatible with
(cid:4)
entropy change as envisioned in (5.1) and Theorem 5.1.

Thus e.g. think of functionals F (ψ) with ψ = ψλ a one parameter family

φδψ
and set δψ = (dψλ/dλ)

REMARK 5.3. From [60] we see that the entropy in S in (5.7) re-
duces to a 4-divergence when the Einstein equations are satisﬁed “on shell”
making S a surface term

Thus the entropy of a bulk region V of spacetime resides in its boundary ∂V
when the Einstein equations are satisﬁed. In varying (5.7) to obtain (5.8)
one keeps the surface contribution to be a constant. Thus in a semiclassical
limit when the Einstein equations hold to the lowest order the entropy is
contributed only by the boundary term and the system is holographic. (cid:4)

REMARK 5.4. Let us call attention here to [22, 40] where a very diﬀer-
ent approach is made to derive the Einstein equations from thermodynamics
using entropy ideas. Using non-equilibrium thermodynamics one ﬁnds also
(cid:4)
that entropy dependence on the Ricci scalar can be accomodated.

6. WDW AND THE EINSTEIN EQUATIONS

where hij is the metric of the spatial hypersurface Σ. One deﬁnes (6A) δS =
[δS/δhij (x)]δhij (x)d3x with integration over Σ and assumes that S is a
function of the 3-geometry only, namely (6B) S = S[3G) (i.e. S is coor-
R
dinate independent). Assume further the principle of constructive inter-
ference (see below) and that either Σ is ﬁnite with no boundary or that
Σ is asymptotically ﬂat. Under these conditions one proves that there are
4 functions N, Ni (i = 1, 2, 3) which together with hij give a spacetime
metric

hold where H = H[hij] and πij = (δS/δhij ). Here σ is the Tomonaga-
Schwinger many ﬁngered time parameter (cf. [14, 55, 79, 91]). One notes
that the dynamical phase S = S[hij ] is required to be a functional of the
3-geometry alone, regardless of coordinates so one writes (6C) S = S[3G]
which means that (6D)
∇j[δS/δhij ] = 0. To see this consider hij(x) with
xi

′i = xi + ǫξi(x) while preserving the geometry where

However the 3G itself is not changed so δS must vanish which means that
(6D) holds.

Now the phase functional is deﬁned on superspace (i.e. the set of equiv-
alence classes of spacelike hij(x) that can be transformed into each other
by spatial coordinate transformations. One considers a solution to the EHJ

equation satisfying (6D), namely S[3G; α(u), β(u)] where α, β are integra-
tion constants deﬁned by parameters u = (u1, u2, u3). Then consider the
phase functionals obtained via (6E) α(u)
→
[28]) yields then (6F) (δS/δ3G)(α +
β(u) + δβ(u). Some argument (cf.
δα, β + δβ)d3G = (δS/δ3G)(α, β)d3G. One is concerned here not with e.g.
δhij /δσ where σ is the Tomonaga time parameter (discussed in Section
6.1 below) but rather with a parametrization independent quantity such as
(δhij /δσ)δσd3x.
(6G) δ2G =
Thus the focus of attention is δhij rather than δhij /δσ and this allows one
to forego the details of some messy parametrization scheme. Now from (6F)
a necessary condition for the “vector” δ3G/δσ(x) to be tangent to a history
through 3G is (6H) δ(δS/δ3G)(δ3G/δσ) = 0 where (δS/δ3G) denotes the
change due to an arbitrary inﬁnitesimal variation in (α(u), β(u)). Then the
EHJ equation together with (6H) contains all of general relativity (GR),
exhibited then as (see below)

The starred vector (δS/δ3G)∗ is the dual with respect to the deWitt metric

One enunciates the principle of constructive interference stated in (6.8)

property

d3x = extremum

if one changs the integration constants α(u), β(u) slightly. One discusses
the fact that freedom in adjusting the integration constants corresponds to
freedom in choosing the momentum density and relates this to the idea of
having a complete solution S as a functional of the maximum number of
possible independent constants (cf. [28] for details).

Now going to the Efe one replaces (6.9) with the help of (6G) by writing

by multiplying them by yet to be determined functions δM (x) and 2δMi(x)

The surface term vanishes due to boundary conditions and one emphasizes
that the change δhij has nothing to do with the variations in πij. The
arbitrary changes in πij fall into two classes (A) Those that satisfy the
variation equations (6I) and (6.8) and (B) Those that do not. The princi-
ple of constructive interference requires that the variations of the integral
(6.11) vanish for class (A) variations. Consequently the coeﬃcients of these
variations must vanish and one then adjusts the functions δM and δMi so
that the coeﬃcients of the class (B) variations also vanish. The result of
this is

The ensuing momentum equations (6.25)-(6.26) are also manifestly covari-

One has now obtained 3 constraint equations (6D) and two sets of equa-
tions (6.17) and (6.25); it remains to show that these plus the EHJ equation
are equivalent to the ten Efe. First it is shown (cf. [28]) that δπij + πij is
a legitimate momentum in that it satisﬁes (6.1) and (6D). Then write the
available equations ((6.8), (6.17), (6.25), and (6I) together as

However the ﬁrst 2 equations are essentially contained in the last 2 equa-
tions (once this holds at the initial point). The last two equations are
covariant and hold on every 3-D slice through spacetime. That the above
four equations imply the ten Efe can be best seen by observing that these
equations can be derived from a variational principle whose Lagrangian is

6.1. MULTIFINGERED TIME. The discussion of the multiﬁngered

Σ is correct and if σ
then e.g. Tσ denotes the set of values for x

A wave functional ψ[φ, T ] can be viewed as a functional of φΣ and (6.30)
shows how ψ changes for an inﬁnitesimal change δT (x) (we will ocassionally
omit boldface on x now). Thus (6.30) is a generalized SE but it does not
involve any preferred foliation of spacetime. Since Σ is determined by T
2 is the probability density for the ﬁeld
one can say that ρ[φ, T ] =

to have the value φ at time T but remember that T is a collection of real
parameters with one real parameter for each point x. Consider now a free
scalar ﬁeld with Hamiltonian density (6N) ˆH(x) =

Now to provide a manifestly covariant QFT one introduces s = (s1, s2, s3)
which serve as coordinates on a 3-D manifold; then write xµ = X µ(s)
leading to one equation f (x0, x1, x2, x3) = 0 determining a 3-D hypersurface
in spacetime. Assume a background metric gµν (x) is given with induced
metric

There is a sort of gauge freedom associated related to the covariance due to

the freedom in choosing the X µ(s). For a timelike hypersurface the simplest
choice of gauge is X i(s) = si. This choice implies δX i(s) = 0 which leads

which is the curved spacetime version of (6.33). The covariant formulation
of QFT leads to a covariant MFT Bohmian interpretation of quantum ﬁelds
which also does not involve a preferred foliation of spacetime. The covariant
Bohmian dynamics does not depend on the choice of coordinates but when
a choice is made then the solution of the MFT Bohmian equations of motion
can be written so that the MFT nature of the ﬁeld is not manifest. However
the Bohmian equation of motion retains its covariant form.

7. TIME

We have seen how MFT arises in QFT and we want to examine this
further in connection with gravity. We begin with remarks based on [2, 3,
9, 10, 13, 21, 22, 26, 27, 30, 44, 45, 47, 48, 54, 55, 56, 66, 86, 93, 94, 95, 96].
We note ﬁrst that time can arise naturally for WDW when using the dDW
theory but a MFT approach seems to require the semiclassical approach and
some interaction with matter (see however [28] as discussed in Section 6).
Weakening the Hamiltonian constraint as in [56] (discussed in Remark 3.1)
also provides a time. The semiclassical approach is illustrated in [10, 28, 47]
for example and we will sketch some of this here following [30].

We forgoe the sandwich ordering here for convenience - it remains our

deformation normal to itself and the commutator generates stretchings of
the hypersurface. A proper understanding of (7.14) and its compatibility
with (7.6) is obtained however if one expands the diﬀeomorphism con-
straints in powers of G (or M) which gives (7E) 2hbcDa(δS0/δhab) = 0 (cf.
[46] for notation - Da ∼
covariant derivative). The highest order M yields
(since S0 does not depend on the scalar ﬁeld φ) (7F) 2hbcDa(δS0/δhab) = 0
(diﬀeomorphism invariance of S0). The next order M 0 leads to a condition
on ψ, namely

Since D depends only on the 3-metric (cf. (7.5)) it is appropriate to demand
that it be diﬀeomorphism invariant by itself, i.e. (7G) hbcDa(δD/δhab) =
0. From (7.15) one ﬁnds then (7H) 2hbcDa(δψ/δhab) = φ,x(δψ/δφ) which
is of the same form as the general solution (7E). Thus it expresses the
invariance of the wave functional ψ[hab, φ] with respect to simultaneous
diﬀeomorphisms of the metric and matter ﬁeld. The consistency condition
condition for (7C) is (7I) [χN , χM ]ψ = [H M
m ]ψ. This however is noth-
ing but the momentum constraint in this order of approximation, namely
(7H), since [χN , χM ] generates a diﬀeomorphism of the metric, (7.9), and
[H M
m ] closes on the momentum density of matter which generates a
diﬀeomorphism of the matter ﬁeld. Thus in the full theory the momen-
tum constraints provide the integrability conditions for the Tomonaga-
Schwinger equations (7C).

Although a family of time functions τ (x) on Riem(Σ) does not exist one can
integrate (7C) along the vector ﬁeld χN for one particular choice of N and
this deﬁnes a global time parameter t with respect to which one global SE
can be written down. It is in this sense that QFT with respect to a chosen
foliation emerges from full quantum gravity. If there are no such general
time functions on Riem(Σ) what about S(Σ) = Riem(Σ)/Dif f (Σ)? To
answer this one projects the vector ﬁelds χN to S which is possible since χN
is invariant under diﬀeomorphisms - referring to [30] for details one arrives
at

π∗[χN , χM ] = [π∗χN , π∗χM ] = 0
(7.11)
and there exist functions ¯τ N on S such that (7J) ¯χN = δ/δ¯τ N where ¯χ =
π∗χ, etc. However the WDW operator is only deﬁned on Riem(Σ) and
some of the intervening calculations do not make sense on S. There is
that is worth reading. This paper
further discussion of anomalies, etc.

corrects some confusion about the existence of Tomonaga-Schwinger times
on Riem(Σ) in other papers (e.g.
[10, 47]) and one should also exercise
caution in this respect relative to the calculations from [28] in Section 6.

7.1. EXTRINSIC CURVATURE AND TIME. We go now to some
papers [2, 3, 26, 27, 44, 70, 95, 96] where from [2] one recalls that it is not
N but the slicing density α(x, t) = N h−1/2 is the freely speciﬁable quantity
for the lapse. One writes then

(7.12)

ds2 =

N 2dt2 + hij(dxi + βidt)(dxj + βjdt)
−
3R). The momentum conjugate to to the metric is
(in what follows R
∼
K ij) where Kij is the extrinsic
a density of weight one πij = h1/2(Khij
curvature with trace K. The natural time derivative for evolution ˆ∂0 acts
in the normal future direction to the spacelike slice Σ and is denoted by an
over-dot; one has ˆ∂0 = ∂t −
Lβ where Lβis the Lie derivative along the shift
β. Every foliation is described by a wave equation for N for some value of
α thus making N a dynamical variable. The Hamiltonian constraint does
not ﬁx the time but does ﬁx the proper time rate dτ /dt = αh1/2 = N along
the normal ∂0. Using α has the eﬀect of altering the Hamiltonian density
from H to

which is of scalar weight 2 and a rational function of the metric. ˜H will be
referred to as the Hamiltonian density and may not vanish. This leads to
a modiﬁcation of the ADM action as in [6, 90], namely (16πG = c = 1)

One sees that the equations of motion (7.16)-(7.17) derived from the
action principle are (7.18)-(7.19) when 4Rij
k = 0. Thus to say that
(7.17) holds is to assert that 4Rij = 0.
In fact the equations of motion
hold strongly independent of whether the constraints are satisﬁed or not
and this is not true in the ADM formulation because of the presence of
the Hamiltonian density in the equations of motion for πij. This diﬀerence
can be explained more fully as follows. Given Gµν = 4Rµν −
4Rσ
σ
4Rk
and the observation that 2G0
0 ≡
4Rij −
k. The vanishing of the right side does not depend on either
the Hamiltonian or momentum densities and is equivalent to 4Rij = 0
0. Thus while 4Rµν = 0 and Gµν = 0 are equivalent
or Gij =
Rij = 0 and Gij = 0 are not equivalent as equations of motion - unless
the Hamiltonian density H = 2h1/2G0
0 vanishes exactly (i.e. unless the
Hamiltonian constraint holds). The ADM action principle is equivalent to
Gij = 0 and one recalls that the use of Rij instead of Gij has always been
preferred by the French school. This raises the important principle that
a constrained Hamiltonian theory should be well behaved even when the
constraints are violated. There is much further calculation in this direction
which we omit here (cf. [70, 96]).

REMARK 7.1. There is a great deal of material now available on
general relativity in terms of Ashtekar variables (see e.g.

46, 52, 75, 77, 80, 87, 88, 89] for a very incomplete list of references on loop
quantum gravity, etc.). In [88] for example one recasts the WDW equation
in the new variables in terms of the 3-geometry elements C and K where

REMARKS ON GRAVITY, ENTROPY, AND INFORMATION

C is the Chern-Simons functional and K is the integral of the trace of the

extrinsic curvature (cf. also [87]).

We consider a clock “paradox” framework where an observer leaves an inertial frame, is accel-
erated and after an arbitrary trip comes back. We discuss a simple equation that gives, in the
1+1 dimensional case, an explicit relation between the time elapsed on the inertial frame and the
acceleration measured by the accelerating observer during the trip.

A non-closed trip with respect to an inertial frame appears closed with respect to another suitable
inertial frame. Using this observation we deﬁne the diﬀerential aging as a function of proper time
and show that it is non-decreasing. The reconstruction problem of special relativity is also discussed
showing that its, at least numerical, solution would allow the construction of an inertial clock.

I.

INTRODUCTION

We have also

The diﬀerential aging implied by special relativity is
surely one of the most astonishing results of modern
physics (for an historical introduction see1, for a bib-
liography with old papers see2). It has been largely de-
bated, and in particular the relationship between the role
of acceleration and the diﬀerence in proper times of iner-
tial and accelerated observers has been discussed3. The
old question as to whether acceleration could be consid-
ered responsible for diﬀerential aging receives a simple
answer by noticing that proper and inertial time are re-
lated in the time dilation eﬀect; since relative velocity
enters there so does acceleration changing the velocity.
The acceleration, however, is not the ultimate source of
diﬀerential aging as the twin paradox in non-trivial space-
time topologies can be reformulated without any need of
accelerated observers4.

Here we give a simple equation that relates acceleration
and diﬀerential aging in the case the accelerated observer
undergoes an unidirectional, but otherwise arbitrary, mo-
tion. We shall prove that relation in the next section.
Here we want to discuss and apply it to some cases pre-
viously investigated with more elementary methods.

Choose units such that c = 1. Let K be the iner-
tial frame and choose coordinates in a way such that
two of them can be suppressed. Let O be an acceler-
ated observer with timelike worldline xµ : [0, ¯τ ]
M
and x1(0) = x1(¯τ ) = 0, where τ is the proper time
parametrization and xµ, µ = 0, 1 are the coordinates
of the inertial frame. Let, moreover, a(τ ) be the accel-
eration of O with respect to the local inertial frame at
x(τ ). To be more precise, the quantity
a is the ap-
parent acceleration measured by O and so it has a pos-
itive or negative sign depending on the direction. Let
T = x0(¯τ )
x0(0) be the (positive) inertial time interval
between the departure and arrival of O, we have11

Some comments are in order. In no place we need to

with that of the origin of K. This proves the diﬀerential
aging eﬀect. In section II A we shall give another proof
that does not use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

∈

Often5 the diﬀerential aging eﬀect is proved in curved
(and hence even in ﬂat) spacetimes by noticing that the
connecting geodesic, that is the trajectory of equation
x1(τ ) = 0 in our case, locally maximizes the proper time
γ dτ . Theorem 1 implies the global
functional I[γ] =
maximization property in 1+1 Minkowski spacetime and
R
has the advantage of giving an explicit formula for the
inertial round-trip dilation.

A. The simplest example

The simplest example is that of uniform motion in
two intervals [0, ¯τ /2] and [¯τ /2, ¯τ ].
In the ﬁrst interval
O moves with respect to K at velocity v = dx1/dx0, in
the second interval at velocity
v. Although this is a
quite elementary example it is interesting to look at the
time dilation-acceleration equation and see how it pre-
dicts the same result. The ﬁrst problem is that Eq. (1)
holds for integrable acceleration functions.
In this ex-
ample, instead, the acceleration has a singularity at ¯τ /2

motion of O is not forced to coincide with that of K’s
origin for τ outside the interval). The reader can easily

If the acceleration causes, in an arbitrary small interval
centered at ˜τ , a variation ∆θ in rapidity then we must
write a = ∆θδ(τ

acceleration equation with this interpretation. In pres-
ence of such singularities, however, it is no longer true
that T does not depend on the initial and ﬁnal velocities
of K. Indeed, we need to use this information to ﬁnd the
coeﬃcient ∆θ. In the case at hand we have

prised by the fact that this simple case needs so much
work, as this is a rather pathological case. No real ob-
server would survive an inﬁnite acceleration. The advan-
tage of the time dilation-acceleration equation turns out
in more realistic cases.

C. A more complicated example

This example was considered by Taylor and Wheeler9.
It has the advantage that the acceleration has no Dirac’s
deltas and O departs from and arrives at K with zero
velocity. The interval is divided into four equal parts
of proper time duration ¯τ /4. The acceleration in these

intervals is successively g,

celeration in the second half interval is opposite to the
one in the ﬁrst half interval the observer indeed returns

II. THE RECONSTRUCTION PROBLEM IN
SPECIAL RELATIVITY

In this section we consider the problem of reconstruct-
ing the motion in the inertial frame starting from the
knowledge of the acceleration. Similar mechanical prob-
lems have been studied in10.
It can be stated in full
Minkowski spacetime as follows.

(a(τ )

Consider a timelike worldline xµ(τ ) on Minkowski
spacetime and a Fermi-transported triad ei. Let ai(τ ) =
ei) be the components of the acceleration vector
−
with respect to the triad, a = aiei. Determine, starting
from the data ai(τ ), the original curve up to an aﬃne
transformation of Minkowski spacetime.

·

Here the Fermi-transported triad represents gyro-
scopes. The components of the acceleration with respect
to this triad are therefore measurable by O using three
orthogonal gyroscopes and an accelerometer. The solu-
tion to this problem may be relevant for future space
travellers. Indeed, although the twin ‘paradox’ has been
studied mainly assuming the possibility of some commu-
nication by light signals, it is more likely that when dis-
tances grow communication becomes impossible. Sup-
pose the space traveller does not want to be lost but
still wants the freedom to choose time by time its tra-
jectory, then he/her should ﬁnd some way to know its
inertial coordinates. The only method, if no references
in space are given, is to solve the reconstruction prob-
lem. Keeping track of the acceleration during the jour-
ney the observer would be able to reconstruct its inertial
coordinates without looking outside the laboratory. In
particular he would be able to construct (merging an ac-

celerometer, three gyroscopes, and an ordinary clock) an
inertial clock i.e. a clock that displays x0(τ ).

The solution to the reconstruction problem gives also
to O the advantage of knowing its own position even be-
fore K knows it. Indeed, O can know xµ(τ ) immediately
while K has to wait for light signals from O. In case of
perturbations in the trajectory, O can immediately ap-
ply some corrections while, for great distances, a decision
from K would take too much time.

In 1+1 dimensions the reconstruction problem can be
solved easily. For higher dimensions it becomes much
more complicated and numerical methods should be
used. Let us give the solution to the 1+1 case. We use
the timelike convention η00 = 1.

If vµ = dxµ/dx0, v = dx1/dx0 and uµ = dxµ/dτ , then

Note that v(0) is also easily measurable by O since at τ =
0, K and O are crossing each other. Without knowing
v(0) the inertial coordinates are determined only up to
a global aﬃne transformation. Indeed, we may say that
the knowledge of v(0) speciﬁes, up to translations, the
inertial coordinates and frame with respect to which we
describe O’s motion.

Now, consider the invariant under aﬃne transforma-

tions

Since x(τ ) is in the chronological future of x(0) there is
a timelike geodesic passing through them. The inertial

observer K(τ ) moving along that geodesic sees the mo-
tion of the accelerated observer as a round trip. If xµ
K(τ )(τ ) = x1
are its coordinates x1
previous invariant reads

K(τ )
K(τ )(0) = 0, thus the

that is, T (τ ) is the travel duration with respect to an
inertial observer that sees the motion of the accelerated
observer as a round trip that ends at τ . Using the relation

Remarkably the dependence on v(0) disappears. This fol-
lows from the fact that contrary to x0(τ ) and x1(τ ), the
quantity T (τ ) is a Lorentz invariant and as such should
not depend on the choice of frame (i.e.
the choice of
v(0)).

In order to prove the second theorem note that if, with
respect to K, O departs with zero velocity then from (5),
after imposing the round-trip condition x1(¯τ ) = x1(0),

that is, the two factors in the formula for T 2 coincide.
Finally, if O departs and returns with zero velocity we

have

relation a = dθ/dτ .

A. Diﬀerential aging

We give now a diﬀerent proof that T (¯τ ) > ¯τ unless
[0, ¯τ ] in which case T (¯τ ) = ¯τ and O

a(τ ) = 0 for all τ
is at rest in K.

∈

−

The idea is to deﬁne the diﬀerential aging even for
proper times τ < ¯τ as the diﬀerential aging between
K(τ ) and O. The diﬀerential aging at τ is therefore by
τ , that is the diﬀerence be-
deﬁnition ∆(τ ) = T (τ )
tween the proper time elapsed for an inertial observer
that reach x(τ ) from x(0) and that elapsed in the accel-
erating frame. Roughly speaking if at proper time τ the
accelerating observer asks “What is the diﬀerential aging
now?” the answer using this idea would be: it is the dif-
ferential aging between you and an imaginary twin who
reached the same event where you are now, but moving
along a geodesic. This deﬁnition has the advantage of
avoiding conventions for distant simultaneity.

Since ∆(0) = 0 this theorem implies that ∆(τ ) > 0 for

τ . This proves again
the diﬀerential aging eﬀect. However, the theorem says
something more. It proves that the deﬁnition of diﬀeren-
tial aging we have given is particularly well behaved. It
allows us to say that, as proper time passes, the imagi-
nary twin is getting older and older with respect to the
accelerating observer.

III. CONCLUSIONS

4

We have discussed the reconstruction problem in spe-
cial relativity showing its relevance for the construction
of inertial clocks and in general for the positioning of the
space traveller. We have given a simple formula that re-
lates the round-trip inertial time dilation with the accel-
eration measured by the non-inertial observer and have
applied it to some well know cases to show how it works
even in the presence of singularities. We believe that it
could be useful in order to explain clearly the relation-
ship between acceleration and diﬀerential aging T (τ )
τ .
Indeed, the diﬀerential aging eﬀect is obtained easily by
applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

−

Although there is a section on the twin paradox in al-
most every textbook on special relativity, examples with
singularities are not always completely satisfactory, while
more reﬁned examples require a lot of work. On the
contrary the derivation of the time dilation-acceleration
formula is quite elementary needing only some concepts
from calculus.
Its derivation as a classroom exercise
would probably convince students of the reality of the
diﬀerential aging eﬀect.

Is G a conversion factor or a fundamental
unit?

Abstract

By using fundamental units c, ¯h, G as conversion factors one can
easily transform the dimensions of all observables. In particular one
can make them all “geometrical”, or dimensionless. However this has
no impact on the fact that there are three fundamental units, G being
one of them. Only experiment can tell us whether G is basically
fundamental.

It is well known [1] that to each mass M there corresponds a characteristic
length rg, the so called gravitational radius (a body with radius r = rg forms
a black hole):

rg = 2GM/c2 ,

where G is gravitational constant

G = 6.673(10) × 10−11m3/kg s

,

while c is velocity of light. Thus in all physical equations M can be substi-
tuted by rg so that mass can be “exorcised” from deﬁnitions of all physical
observables. As a result everything can be measured in “geometrical” units
of length L and time T instead of standard L, T , M units.

One can use M ′ = GM instead of M in order to reduce all measurements
in physics to measurements of space and time intervals and exorcise G from all
equations of physics, thus reducing the number of fundamental dimensionful
constants. We would like to make a few rather trivial remarks concerning
this proposal.

First, it is obvious that in deﬁning M ′ one can use GMg(L, T ) instead of
GM, where g is an arbitrary function of geometric units L, T . In particular,
in the standard case of gravitational radius g = 2/c2.

Second, as is well known (see e.g.

[2]), c, ¯h, G are fundamental units in
the sense that c represents relativity, ¯h – quantum mechanics, while Planck
mass mP = q¯hc/G is connected with the space-time scales lP = ¯h/mP c and
tP = lP /c at which gravity must become strong and of quantum character.
Contrary to that, the units based on M ′ have no fundamental character.

Third, by using any of three fundamental units as a conversion factor one
does not reduce the number of fundamental units and dimensions. E.g. when
using c as a unit of velocity, one obviously preserves it as a fundamental unit.
At the same time one can measure time in units of length, or length in units
of time. However length remains length, while time remains time. Similar
considerations are valid for mass M, G and gravitational radius rg or any
combination of the type GMg(L, T ).

Of course, if G turns out to be only an “eﬀective constant” as is the case
in theories in which gravity is modiﬁed at submillimeters distances (see e.g.
[3]), then new physics will appear well below Planck mass, maybe even at a
few TeV, thus changing the value of fundamental mass. In the case that G is
only an eﬀective constant, a new dimensionless parameter would appear in
low-energy physics: mnew
Pl . Thus the question posed in the title of this
letter could be answered by further study of the nature of gravity.

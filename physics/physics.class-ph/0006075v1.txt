1 Problem

A popular model at science museums (and also a science toy [1]) that illustrates how curva-
ture can be associated with gravity consists of a surface of revolution r = −k/z with z < 0
about a vertical axis z. The curvature of the surface, combined with the vertical force of
Earth’s gravity, leads to an inward horizontal acceleration of kg/r2 for a particle that slides
freely on the surface in a circular, horizontal orbit.

Consider the motion of a particle that slides freely on an arbitrary surface of revolution,
r = r(z) ≥ 0, deﬁned by a continuous and diﬀerentiable function on some interval of z. The
surface may have a nonzero minimum radius R at which the slope dr/dz is inﬁnite. Discuss
the character of oscillations of the particle about circular orbits to deduce a condition that
there be a critical radius rcrit > R, below which the orbits are unstable. That is, the motion
of a particle with r < rcrit rapidly leads to excursions to the minimum radius R, after which
the particle falls oﬀ the surface.

Give one or more examples of analytic functions r(z) that exhibit a critical radius as
deﬁned above. These examples provide a mechanical analogy as to how departures of gravi-
tational curvature from that associated with a 1/r2 force can lead to a characteristic radius
inside which all motion tends toward a singularity.

2 Solution

We work in a cylindrical coordinate system (r, θ, z) with the z axis vertical. It suﬃces to
consider a particle of unit mass.

In the absence of friction, there is no torque on a particle about the z axis, so the angular
momentum component J = r2 ˙θ about that axis is a constant of the motion, where ˙ indicates
diﬀerentiation with respect to time.

For motion on a surface of revolution r = r(z), we have ˙r = r′ ˙z, where ′ indicates

diﬀerentiation with respect to z. Hence, the kinetic energy can be written

T =

The potential energy is V = gz. Using Lagrange’s method, the equation of motion associated
with the z coordinate is

For a perturbation about this orbit of the form

z = z0 + ǫ sin ωt,

we have, to order ǫ,

This condition has the interesting geometrical interpretation (noted by a referee) that the
orbit is unstable wherever

(1/r2)′′ < 0,

(11)

i.e., where the function 1/r2 is concave inwards.

and there is no regime of instability.

For example, if r = −k/z, then 1/r2 = z2/k2 is concave outwards, ω2 = J 2/(k2 + r4
0),
We give three examples of surfaces of revolution that satisfy condition (11).
First, the hyperboloid of revolution deﬁned by

R = 1.1547R ≡ rcrit.

As r0 approaches R, the instability growth time approaches an orbital period.

Another example is the Gaussian surface of revolution,

which has a minimum radius R, and a critical radius rcrit = R 4√e = 1.28R.

Our ﬁnal example is the surface

r2 = R2ez

r = −

(16)

(17)

which has a minimum radius of R = 2k, approaches the surface r = −k/z at large r (small
z), and has a critical radius of rcrit = 6k/√5 = 1.34R.
These examples arise in a 2 + 1 geometry with curved space but ﬂat time. As such, they
are not fully analagous to black holes in 3 + 1 geometry with both curved space and curved
time. Still, they provide a glimpse as to how a particle in curved spacetime can undergo
considerably more complex motion than in ﬂat spacetime.

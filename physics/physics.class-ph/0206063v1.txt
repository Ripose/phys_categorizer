RADIATION REACTION
FOR A CHARGED BROWNIAN PARTICLE

As it is known a model of a charged particle with ﬁnite size is a good tool to
consider the eﬀects of self- action and backreaction, caused by electromagnetic
radiation.
In this work the ”size” of a charged particle is induced by its
stochastic Brownian vibration. Appropriate equation of particle’s motion with
radiation force is derived.
It is shown that the solutions of this equation
correctly describe the eﬀects of radiation reaction.

It is known from the classical electrodynamics that a charged particle,
moving with acceleration, must radiate electromagnetic waves and thus must
feel the backreaction of such radiation. How one can take into account this
backreaction in the equation of motion of a particle ?

This problem is very old ( count from the pioneer works of Abragam
and Lorentz [1] ), but till know it is under focus of diﬀerent investigations,
handling it as from quantum ﬁeld theory point of view, so from point of view
of the classical physics.

The origin of the problem is the following. If in frames of some theoretical
investigation the size of radiating body can be neglected ( in comparison with
other characteristic lengths), then one can try to use the notion of ”point-
like” particle for such body and its mathematical representation - the Dirac’s
delta-function. But the use of the delta-function inevitably leads to diver-
gences in some physical quantities, such as self- electromagnetic energy of
point charged particle, its eﬀective mass and so on, and consequently to the
necessity of mass renormalization. Dirac was the ﬁrst [2] to do this renor-
malization and as the result the famous equation with relativistic radiation

1

reaction for point-like particle was derived ( in the literature - the Abragam
- Lorentz -Dirac equation (ALD) ).

But immediately scientists found out ( and Dirac was among them) that
ALD equation leads to many paradoxes. Among them in the literature are
usually mentioned [3] the following:

a) the existence of runaway solutions ( in the absences of external forces
the radiating particle begins to move with growing velocity up to that of
light);

b) preacceleration (after supplementary condition, excluding the runaway
solutions, the solutions remain, describing particle, ”feeling” the external
force with some advance in time);

c) the existence of ”exotic” ALD solutions for head-on-collisions (i.e. for
two opposite charged particles there are solutions, describing their mutual
repelling);

and so on.
Thus one can understand the scientists, declaring that ”the ALD equation

must be modiﬁed”.

There are two basic ways to do such modiﬁcation:
a) to consider problem of ”point-like” particle not in the frames of classical
theory, but within quantum ﬁeld theory, studying the processes of interaction
of charged quantum particles with their quantum electromagnetic ﬁelds;

b) to stay in frames of classical theory, but refusing the notion of ”point-
like” particle and considering small object of ﬁnite size like charged particles
of dusty plasma, Brownian charged particles and others.

In his works on radiation theme the author follows the second path, con-

sidering nonquantum charged particles of small ﬁnite size [4].

In particular in this work is investigated the inﬂuence of induced by Brow-
nian vibration the eﬀective size of charged particle (in appropriate time scale)
on the eﬀect of radiation reaction. The equation of center mass motion of
such particle is derived. Some solutions of this equation are investigated.

Let us note that in (7) one can consider varying in time densities if the

inequality (6) is valid.

Now turn to the motion of charged Brownian particle.
Let us take those time intervals Tv (time scales), for which the Brownian

motion can be described by distribution function:

Tv ≫
here TBr - is the typical time for Maxwell’s velocity distribution to appear.
Let n(t, ~r) be the probability to ﬁnd Brownian particle at the moment of

TBr

time t in the volume d~r , thus n - is the distribution function with norm

This function obeys the conservation law

Let the motion of the Brownian particle consists from two motions -
the ﬁrst one, regular, with the velocity ~v = ~v(t), under the inﬂuence of some
external regular force ~Fext, and the second one, irregular - Brownian diﬀusion
with velocity ~u :

In other words around the regular trajectory of particle’s center of mass
there are Brownian vibration in such a way that the average value of the
square particle displacement from the regular trajectory is proportional, fol-
lowing Einstein formula, to Dt. Thus appears the eﬀective particle’s ”size”,
proportional to √Dt.

Equation (8) with the help of (9) can be put in the form

(10)

As the particle’s center of mass moves along its trajectory with velocity
~v = d ~R(t)/dt, the distribution function gives the probability of particle’s
displacement from this trajectory, so

Thus equation (13) ( or (14) ) take into account the existence of the ﬁnite
size of the charged particle, induced by Brownian vibration (in time scale
Tρ ). Due to the ﬁniteness of particle’s size, the self-force,
TBr ≪
which is the radiation reaction force in our approach, has ﬁnite value and
there is no need to do mass renormalization.

Equation (13) diﬀers from ALD equation, but has much in common with

the Sommerfeld ﬁnite-size models of a charged particle.

Let us mention the following features of equation (13) ((14)):
1). If the external force is constant: ~Fext = ~F0 = const then eq. (13) has

the solution

~a =

If the eﬀective mass is approximated as Q2

c2LBr , where LBr - the typical
”size” of Brownian spread, equal according to Einstein formula, to √4Dt,
then, following (15), the acceleration of Brownian particle slightly increases
in time up to its maximum value ~F0
. In other words,
in this process the self-force (force of radiation reaction) is not equal to zero
and together with the eﬀective self- electromagnetic mass vanishes at t

2). If the external force is absent, one can ﬁnd by ordinary substitution

m , achieved at t

that eq. (14) has no ”free” harmonic solutions like

~v = ~A cos(wt)

That is, contrary to Sommerfeld models (see, for ex., [4] ) there are no
oscillations, free of radiation damping.

In details, ”free” solutions of eq.

(14) are exponentially damped.

Indeed, after substitution in (14) the velocity in the form

This means that the solutions of (14) for zero external force are exponentially

Thus we have found out that the consideration of the Brownian spread of
particle’s size (in appropriate time scale) leads to new equation of particle’s
motion with solutions having explicit physical sense and avoids the troubles
connected with the notion ”point-like” particle.

It should be noted that the idea to consider the existence of particle’s
size, induced by Brownian vibration, is not the original one (see, for ex., the
discussion and references in the chapter 22 of the book [8]). Nevertheless
author does not know the works where this idea was realized in concrete
mathematical equations. In our work - this is the equation (13). It is integro

9

- diﬀerential - diﬀerence equation with retardation. That is why it may have
solutions, besides mentioned above, typical for the models of particles of a
ﬁnite size - the so called tunneling solutions [4]. It would be interesting to
investigate this problem more closely in the further works.

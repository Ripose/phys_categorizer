Abstract

The deﬁnition of mass of a scalar ﬁeld in a curved space has often
been generalized by grouping coupling terms between the ﬁeld and the
Ricci curvature with non–curvature–related mass terms. In a broader
point of view, one sees that a common misunderstanding resulting
from such an identiﬁcation leads one, in the case of the spin 2 ﬁeld,
to regard the cosmological constant as a non–vanishing mass of cos-
mological origin for the graviton. Similarly, there are inconsistencies
for the spin 1 ﬁeld. Instead, the intrinsic mass of a ﬁeld should be
regarded as being independent of the background curvature.

1 Introduction

The generalization of the Klein–Gordon equation for a scalar ﬁeld φ on a
curved spacetime [1]

presents the possibility of a non–minimal coupling between the scalar ﬁeld
and the Ricci curvature R of spacetime. Analogously, direct couplings with
the Ricci and Riemann tensors appear, respectively, in the wave equations
for the electromagnetic ﬁeld and for gravitational waves propagating on a
curved background spacetime. Various authors have grouped the scalar ﬁeld–
curvature coupling term ξRφ with the mass term m2φ in Eq. (1.1), particu-
larly when the Ricci curvature of the background spacetime is constant. In
this case, an eﬀective mass µ given by

µ2 = m2 + ξR

(1.2)

is sometimes introduced. Equation (1.2) has led to problems of interpreta-
tion.

The interpretation of the terms coupling the ﬁeld with the curvature as
mass terms has also been extended to wave equations for ﬁelds of higher
spin. In fact, Eq. (1.1) is the prototype of the wave equation on a curved
spacetime, and is a guide for the study of more complicated wave equations.
For the case of spin 2 ﬁelds (gravitational waves), the identiﬁcation of ﬁeld–
curvature coupling terms with mass terms frequently led to attribute to the
graviton a mass of cosmological origin related to the cosmological constant
[2]–[7]. Despite some attempts [8, 5], the past and recent misunderstandings
on this issue still await clariﬁcation in the literature. The interpretation of
terms like ξRφ in Eq. (1.1) as mass terms leads to properties of the “mass”
µ which are physically unacceptable. The proper interpretation is to regard
the mass of the ﬁeld as being independent of the background curvature.

2 The Klein–Gordon ﬁeld

Intuitively, one would be inclined to consider the mass of a particle as an
intrinsic characteristic which does not depend on whether the particle is in
ﬂat space or in curved space. The deﬁnition (1.2) of mass of a scalar ﬁeld in
curved spacetime does not have this property.

Consider the de Sitter space with arbitrarily large (constant) Ricci cur-
vature (i.e. arbitrarily large cosmological constant Λ), and consider Eq. (1.1)
with m = 0 and ξ = 1/6 in this space:

✷φ

−

R φ = 0 .

(2.3)

Equation (1.2) gives a value of the eﬀective mass µ which is arbitrarily large.
However, the solutions of the wave equation (2.3) propagate on the light
cones of de Sitter space. This result is well known in the investigations of
Huygens’ principle in curved spacetimes and of “tails” of radiation [9]–[12].
The Green function G(x′, x) of Eq. (1.1) is, for a general given spacetime, the
sum of two contributions; the ﬁrst contribution has support on the light cone,
and describes lightlike propagation of the waves. The second contribution has
support inside the light cone, and describes timelike propagation of waves.
In general, the second contribution is diﬀerent from zero even when m = 0
in Eq. (1.1), and is associated with tails (violations of Huygens’ principle
[9]–[12] – see [13] for a pedagogical introduction).

Equation (2.3) is conformally invariant and the de Sitter universe is
conformally ﬂat: therefore the second contribution to the Green function
G(x′, x) of Eq. (2.3) vanishes (no tails) and the waves propagate strictly on
the light cones [14]–[17]. In other words, the tail–free propagation property
experienced by scalar waves in ﬂat space is transferred to the conformally
ﬂat de Sitter space. Therefore, we have an arbitrarily large eﬀective mass
µ = (R/6)1/2, but the solutions of Eq. (2.3) propagate on light cones.
It
appears reasonable to require that, whatever deﬁnition of mass is adopted in
curved spacetimes, particles with nonzero mass necessarily propagate strictly
inside the light cone. The deﬁnition given by Eq. (1.2) clearly does not satisfy
this requirement.

If ξ

= 1/6, Eq. (1.1) (with m = 0) is not conformally invariant. It may
appear that, in this case, the conclusions reached using our example with
ξ = 1/6 are not valid and, at most, the previous example suggests some

3

6
caution in the use of Eq. (1.2). However, the Einstein equivalence principle
[18] applied to the scalar ﬁeld φ restricts the value of ξ to be 1/6, a result
that is now well established [19, 20, 21].

The previous example shows clearly the unphysical properties of the mass
µ deﬁned by Eq. (1.2). Therefore, the term “mass” of the scalar ﬁeld φ
in Eq. (1.1) should be used exclusively for the coeﬃcient m, rejecting the
alternative deﬁnition (1.2). In other words, the intrinsic mass is independent
of the background curvature. Further support for this identiﬁcation is given
in the next section.

3 The electromagnetic ﬁeld

We now consider the Maxwell ﬁeld tensor Fµν which,
sources, satisﬁes the curved space Maxwell equations:

in the absence of

νFµν = 0 ,

∇
∇[µFνρ] = 0 .
Alternatively, the photon ﬁeld can be described using the four–vector poten-
tial Aµ. In the Lorentz gauge

αAα = 0, Aµ satisﬁes the wave equation

(3.2)

We consider again the de Sitter universe, in which the Ricci tensor is given
by Rρσ = Λgρσ. In this space, Eq. (3.3) reduces to

(3.1)

(3.3)

(3.4)

According to the identiﬁcation underlying Eq. (1.2), one would conclude from
Eq. (3.4) that the cosmological constant provides a mass for the photon ﬁeld.
One can actually derive a wave equation for the Maxwell tensor by applying
the operator

µ to Eq. (3.2) and using Eq. (3.1):

∇

✷Fµν + 2RαµνβF βα + 2Rβ[µFν]

β = 0 .

Rµνρσ =

gµ[ρ gσ]ν ,

✷Fµν −

4Λ

F µν = 0 ,

in which a “mass term” appears, leading to a “mass” (4Λ/3)1/2 for the photon
ﬁeld. This conclusion is incorrect, which can be seen as follows: The Maxwell
equations (3.1), (3.2) in four dimensions are conformally invariant and the de
Sitter space is conformally ﬂat. Thus, the electromagnetic ﬁeld propagates
on the light cone [14, 16, 17]. Since the propagation of electromagnetic waves
in this case is restricted to the light cones, we know that the Maxwell ﬁeld
is massless according to any useful deﬁnition of mass for a ﬁeld in a curved
space.

The identiﬁcation of the linear term in the ﬁeld as a mass term, as ex-
pressed in Eq. (1.2) leads to another inconsistency. According to this identi-
ﬁcation, in the case of a spin 1 ﬁeld in de Sitter spacetime, one would read a
mass √Λ from Eq. (3.4) for the vector potential Aµ. However, the wave equa-
tion (3.7) for the ﬁeld Fµν would provide a mass
4Λ/3, so that the “mass”
depends on whether one chooses to consider the potential or the ﬁeld. This
situation is markedly diﬀerent from the case of the massive spin 1 ﬁeld in
Minkowski space. In ﬂat space, the equations for the Proca 4–potential are

where m is the mass of the Proca potential. The Proca ﬁeld Fµν satisﬁes

¿From Eqs. (3.10) and (3.11) and from the identity ∂[ρFµν] = 0, it is easy to
derive a wave equation for Fµν:

∂µAµ = 0 ,

Equations (3.9) and (3.12) provide the same value for the mass of the Proca
ﬁeld, and there is no trace of the ambiguity encountered in Eqs. (3.4) and
(3.7).

The presence of terms coupling the ﬁeld tensor with the Riemann and
Ricci tensors follows from the fact that, in the derivation of the wave equation
for the ﬁeld tensor Fµν in a curved space, one can take the combination of
∇µ✷Aν − ∇ν✷Aµ to generate ✷Fµν. However, due to
covariant derivatives
the non–commutativity of covariant derivatives, contractions of the ﬁeld Fµν
with the Riemann tensor inevitably appear in the wave equation for Fµν in
∇µ✷Aν − ∇ν✷Aµ
addition to the term ✷Fµν. By contrast, in a ﬂat space,
is precisely ✷Fµν and hence the mass which is identiﬁed from the equation
for the 4–vector potential is the same as the mass that is identiﬁed from the
equation for Fµν.

4 Gravitational waves

A recurring point in the literature involves the eﬀect of the cosmological
constant in determining the character of gravitational waves which propagate
in curved spacetimes. It has been explicitly stated or implicitly suggested
that the cosmological constant endows the graviton with a rest mass [2]–[7].
This conclusion is incorrect and, despite some attempts [8], the issue has not
been clariﬁed in the literature.

The old argument supporting the idea of the cosmological constant as
endowing the graviton with a mass relies on the fact that the weak ﬁeld limit
of the Einstein equations with a cosmological constant produces a Yukawa
(instead of a Coulombic) potential [2]–[4]. This feature has been known for
many years and its astrophysical consequences have been explored [22]. A
Yukawa potential is also obtained by postulating a ﬁnite range of gravitation
arising from a nonvanishing graviton mass [4].

Previous claims [8, 5] against the identiﬁcation of the cosmological con-
stant as the mass of the graviton [23] proceed as follows. An exact solution

The last term in the left hand side of Eq. (4.4) is susceptible to being inter-

preted as a mass term. However, in Ref. 8 it is noted that Rµρhν
2Λhµν. Using this result, Eq. (4.4) is reduced to

ρ + Rνρhµ

✷hµν −

2Rαµνβhαβ = 0 .

According to Ref. 8, the substitution has removed all trace of Λ and the
propagation equation is reduced to the same form as it would have in a
spacetime free of any cosmological constant. The claim that this proves that
the propagation describes a massless ﬁeld on this basis is unfounded: if one
proceeds to substitute the form (3.6) of the Riemann tensor, one obtains

✷hµν −

2Λ

hµν = 0 ,

in which a “mass term” re–appears in the wave equation for gravitational
waves, and one is presented with a quandary. Equation (4.6) agrees with
Eq. (2.21) of Ref. 21 and is obtained by imposing (4.3) and the additional
νhµν, h and a proof that
constraint h = 0 (the propagation equations for
νhµν = 0, h = 0 can be imposed in a globally hyperbolic
the constraints
spacetime can be found, e.g., in Ref. [24]).

Armed with our argument from the previous section, we recognize that
the identiﬁcation of the second term in the left hand side of Eq. (4.6) as a
mass term is inappropriate. Thus, it is seen that the correct conclusion was
reached in Ref. 8, but the proof was incomplete. While the presence of Λ
aﬀects the propagation of scalar, vector and tensor ﬁelds in curved spacetime,
it does not endow the ﬁelds with intrinsic mass.

The connection between the cosmological constant and the mass of the
graviton is excluded. Although the introduction of the quantity µ in Eq. (1.2)
may be useful from the mathematical point of view in some cases, it should
not be identiﬁed with the physical mass of the ﬁeld, since such an identiﬁca-
tion would lead to unacceptable physical properties for the ﬁeld.

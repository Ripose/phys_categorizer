Abstract

Embedded clusters, which are embedded in bulk materials and diﬀerent
from the surroundings in structures, should be common in materials. This
paper studies resonance of such clusters. This work is stimulated by a recent
experimental observation that some localized clusters behavior like ﬂuid at
the mesoscopic scale in many solid materials [Science in China(Series B). 46,
176 (2003)]. We argue that the phenomenon is just a vivid illustration of res-
onance of embedded clusters, driven by ubiquitous microwaves. Because the
underlying mechanism is fundamental and embedded structures are usual,
the phenomenon would have great signiﬁcance in material physics.

Mechanical resonance is a common thread which runs through almost
every branch of physics. It occurs when the driving frequency matches the
natural frequency of the sample. Recently, mechanical resonance has been
observed at the mesoscopic scale for some nano-size materials.1,2,3,4,5 It takes
place in near-ﬁeld scanning optical microscope probes1,2 and some nanos-
tructures such as carbon nanotubes,3 ZnO nanobelts4 and SiO2 nanowires.5
Mechanical resonance is a basic concept in textbooks and it is known that
the boundary condition determines the normal modes of the samples. But
theoretical analyses only cover samples with unambiguous boundaries, i.e.,
two ﬁxed ends, two free ends, or one ﬁxed end and one free end. System-
atic knowledge is still lacking in such a typical case: embedded clusters, as
shown in Fig. 1(a), which are embedded in a bulk material and are diﬀerent
from the surrounding parts in structure, and so have boundaries neither ﬁxed
nor free. This kind of clusters is usual at both macroscopic and mesoscopic
scale in real world, such as materials embedded in other materials and the
metastable structures in solids. It is clear that resonance can occur when the
mechanical property of the embedded cluster is extremely diﬀerent from that
of surrounding materials and it can’t occur when the properties of the em-
bedded cluster and the surrounding materials are quite similar. For general
case, whether resonance can occur and how it occurs are still unclear.

The study of this problem is motivated by a recent experimental discov-
ery of Gao et al..6,7,8 With an optical microscope, Gao et al. have observed
some localized clusters in the range of 0.1×0.1µm2 to 2×2µm2 on the surface
of a sample of Cu-Zn-Al alloy under normal pressure and temperature6,7;
these clusters behave like ﬂuid: amorphism, ﬂowing, waving, and they also
expand and then contract; such motion can last from several seconds to sev-
eral weeks.6,7,8 Later the similar phenomena have been observed in some
other solid alloys, mineral crystal, gabbro, monocrystal nickel sulfate, semi-
conductor.8 In short, they ﬁnd mesoscopic-scale clusters in many materials
which show irregular movement at mesoscopic scale while their surround-
ings keep static. This is an interesting phenomenon and we believe that
after the underlying mechanism is elucidated it will be recognized to be of
signiﬁcance and intensive studies will be focused. Our viewpoint is that the
phenomenon is just a vivid illustration of resonance of the embedded clusters.
The ﬂuid-like clusters are metastable structures in solids and just embedded
clusters referred above; ubiquitous microwaves can drive them into resonant
vibrations when microwave frequencies match their natural frequencies; the

2

resonant vibrations can become marked movements at the mesoscopic scale
if the sizes of the clusters and microwave intensities are appropriate.

For the sake of simplicity, we ﬁrst employ a lattice as shown in Fig.
1(b) to study the resonance of the embedded cluster in a 1D sample. The
Hamiltonian is

where pi is the momentum of the ith atom, and xi is the displacement from
the equilibrium position. The mass mi is set to unity and the ﬁrst and last
atoms are ﬁxed. The force constant κi serves as the control parameter, which
takes the value κo for i ∈ [ N −N1
] and is set to unity for the other
atoms. Then the middle part of the lattice with the N1 atoms is structurally
diﬀerent from the other parts of the lattice and thus mimics the embedded
cluster. The other parts represent the bulk sample. Notice that if κi is
a constant for all atoms we will obtain the well-known Fermi-Pasta-Ulam
model, which is a paradigm model in lattice studies.

For the embedded cluster, it is obvious that resonance can occur in the
limit case of κo → 0 (corresponding to ﬁxed boundary condition) or κo → ∞
(to free boundary condition) when the driving frequency matches its nature
frequency. As we know, the natural frequency is ωn = nπ
(1)
N1
for both limit ﬁxed and limit free boundary conditions, and the normal mode
is xn = A sin(nπxi/N1) for the former and is xn = A cos(nπxi/N1) for the
latter, where xi ∈ [ N −N1
]. On the other hand, in the limit of κo → 1
the embedded cluster appears indistinguishable with the other parts.

We apply numerical calculations to test whether resonance can occur in
the embedded cluster in general case. In our simulations the ﬁrst and last
ﬁfty atoms are coupled to Langevin thermostats,9 which mimics the bulk
sample in the environment temperature. The temperature T has been set
equal to 0.01, corresponding to the room temperature.10 The thermodynamic
equilibrium state is established after suﬃcient long evolutions, around t ∼
105. Then we apply periodic forces F = f cos (ωt) to the ﬁrst ﬁfty atoms,
representing the driving forces applied on the surface of the bulk sample. In
ﬁg. 2(a) we show the average amplitude A of the embedded cluster versus
the driving frequency ω in the case of N = 3000, N1 = 1000 and κo =
0.1. One can see, there are two maximum points at ω1 = 0.90 × 10−3 and
ω2 = 1.70 × 10−3. From equation (1) we know that the ﬁrst harmonic is

2 = 2.0 × 10−3 in theory
1 = 1.0 × 10−3 and the second harmonic is ω
ω
for the embedded cluster with limit ﬁxed or free boundary condition. The
two maximum points ω1 and ω2 are close to the ﬁrst and second harmonics
respectively. Fig. 2(b) displays the vibration pattern of the lattice at ω1,
and it is obvious that the pattern corresponds to the ﬁrst normal mode of
the embedded cluster in limit ﬁxed boundary condition. We vary the value
of κo to κo = 2. Resonance occurs at ω = 4.6 × 10−3, which is close to
= 4.4 × 10−3. The vibration pattern (shown in Fig
the theoretical value ω
2.(c)) agrees with the ﬁrst normal mode of the embedded cluster in limit free
boundary condition. Further calculations indicate that resonant mode at
κo < 1 is similar to that at κo = 0.1 while resonant mode at κo > 1 is similar
to that at κo = 2. These results indicate that resonance surely can occur in
the embedded cluster when the force constant κo is suﬃciently diﬀerent from
that of the surrounding part and resonance frequencies shift a little from the
natural frequencies of embedded clusters with limit ﬁxed or free boundary
conditions.

Another notable is resonance amplitude.

It is obvious that resonance
amplitude Af increases linearly with the magnitude f of the driving force. It
is found that resonance amplitude also depend on the size of the embedded
cluster. In Fig. 2(d) we plot Af at the fundamental frequency versus N1,
and the curve shows Af increases linearly with N1. Moreover, Af decreases
with the increase of κo at κo < 1.

We extend the 1D lattice to a 2D lattice. Fig. 2 (e) and (f) show the
vibration patterns at the fundamental frequency ω = 0.026 and the second
harmonic ω = 0.041, which correspond to the ﬁrst and second normal modes
of the embedded cluster with limit ﬁxed boundary condition respectively. In
the calculation the 2D lattice size is 100 × 100 and the embedded cluster at
κo = 0.1 is 50 × 50 in size.

So it is concluded that resonance can occur in embedded clusters if their
force constants are suﬃciently diﬀerent from those of the surroundings and
driving frequencies match their natural frequencies. In the following we illu-
minate the mechanism of Gao’s ﬁnding in detail. First we discuss whether
there exist embedded clusters with quite diﬀerent force constant in mate-
rials. We come to a simple three-atom model to achieve the relationship
between the force constant κ and the atomic separation R. Atoms a and
c are ﬁxed and atom b is connected to them. The atomic separation is
R. Supposing that the interactions between atoms are the Lennard-Jones

4

potential U = σ12R−12 − σ6R−6, then the force constant of the atom b is
κ (R) = −312σ12R−14 + 84σ6R−8. When the separation R increases to 1.4
times (a larger change of lattice constant than 1.4 times has been observed
in Gao’s experiments7), the force constant κo decreases to about 0.06 times
the initial one. Therefore, a little increase of atomic separation can lead
to marked decrease of force constant and such embedded clusters can be
extensive in materials.

From equation (1) the natural frequency of the embedded cluster can be
estimated by ω˜ 1
˜ v/l, where v verges
N1
on the sound velocity in the embedded cluster at around 103m/s and l verges
q
on the size of the embedded cluster at from 0.1µm to 2µm. Then the natural
frequency is about 109 ˜ 1010. It is obvious that in environment there exist
external drives in the frequency range, such as ubiquitous microwaves.

Next we study whether the resonance amplitude of the embedded cluster
can be large enough to be observed. Fig. 2(d) shows Af versus N1 at κo = 0.1,
f = 0.01 and T = 0.01. Af increases linearly with N1 as Af ˜ 0.14N1. We
make an approximate correspondence between simulations and observations
with the numerical result in ﬁg. 2(d). For example, we obtain Af ˜ 103
at N1 ˜ 104. Then for such embedded cluster, the length is 1µm and the
resonance amplitude is about 102nm, supposing that the atomic separation
1 in the numerical simulations corresponds to 0.1 nm in experiments. The
value of the resonance amplitude is comparable to that observed in Gao’s
ﬁnding. So resonance in the embedded cluster is observable with an optical
microscope. Smaller localized clusters will be observed if the microscope has
a larger magniﬁcation.

In summary, we investigate mechanical resonance in the embedded clus-
ter. Resonance can take place when the structure of the embedded cluster is
diﬀerent enough from the surrounding material. Moreover, we believe Gao’s
ﬁnding is resonance of embedded clusters at the mesoscopic scale of materi-
als driven by ubiquitous microwaves. Embedded structures are common in
solids, so the phenomenon would have great signiﬁcance in material physics.
Resonance in the embedded clusters may have inﬂuence on the thermody-
namic properties at the macroscale and fracture at the mesoscopic scale of
materials.

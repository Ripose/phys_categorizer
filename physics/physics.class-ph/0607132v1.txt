Abstract

Real ﬁlaments are not perfectly homogeneous. Most of them have
various materials composition and shapes making their stiﬀnesses not
constant along the arclength. We investigate the existence of circular
and helical equilibrium solutions of an intrinsically straight rod with
varying bending and twisting stiﬀnesses, within the framework of the
Kirchhoﬀ model. The planar ring equilibrium solution only exists for
a rod with a given form of variation of the bending stiﬀness. We show
that the well known circular helix is not an equilibrium solution of
the static Kirchhoﬀ equations for a rod with non constant bending
stiﬀness. Our results may provide an explanation for the variation
of the curvature seen in small closed DNAs immersed in a solution
containing Zn2+, and in the DNA wrapped around a nucleosome.

Keywords: Kirchhoﬀ rod model, inhomogeneous rod, planar ring, generalized
helices, planar elasticae, closed DNA

1 Introduction

Static and dynamics of one-dimensional structures have been the subject

of intense research in Engineering, Physics and Biology. Such ﬁlamentary

objects are present in both nature and man-made devices. The stability of

sub-oceanic cables [1, 2], the tridimensional structure of biomolecules [3] and

bacterial ﬁbers [4], and the mechanical properties of nanosprings [5, 6, 7, 8]

are few of many interesting problems investigated within elastic rod models.

In most cases, the rod is considered as having constant or uniform stiﬀ-

ness, but non-uniform rods have been considered in the literature. It has been

shown that nonhomogeneous Kirchhoﬀ rods may present spatial chaos [9, 10].

Domokos and Holmes studied buckled states of non-uniform elasticae [11].

Deviations from the helical structure of rods due to periodic variation of

the Young’s modulus were veriﬁed numerically by da Fonseca, Malta and

de Aguiar [12]. Homogeneous and nonhomogeneous rods subject to given

boundary conditions were studied by da Fonseca and de Aguiar in [13]. The

eﬀects of a nonhomogeneous mass distribution in the dynamics of unstable

closed rods have been analyzed by Fonseca and de Aguiar [14]. Goriely and

McMillen [15] studied the dynamics of cracking whips [16], Kashimoto and

Shiraishi [17] studied twisting waves in inhomogeneous rods, and Neuringer

and Elishakoﬀ [18] studied natural frequencies of inhomogeneous rods.

It is well known that straight, circular and helical rods are equilibrium

solutions of the Kirchhoﬀ model [19, 20, 21]. These solutions have been used

to study the stability and buckling phenomena of loop elasticae [1, 22], the

twist to writhe conversion phenomenon in twisted straight rods [23], and the

stability of DNA conﬁgurations with or without self-contact [24], to name

some examples.

2

Our aim here is to investigate the existence of circular and helical equilib-

rium solutions for an intrinsically straight, inextensible, unshearable, and in-

homogeneous rod with circular cross-section, within the Kirchhoﬀ rod model.

Establishing the stability (even in the case of simple equilibrium conﬁg-

urations) of a rod is a non-trivial task (see, for example, Refs.

[22, 23, 24,

25, 26, 27, 28]). Since the study of the stability analysis departs from the

knowledge of equilibrium solutions, our work is the starting point for the

study of the stability of equilibrium solutions of inhomogeneous rods.

The inhomogeneity of the rod is considered through the bending and

twisting coeﬃcients varying along its arclength s, B(s) and C(s), respectively.

We shall derive a set of non-linear diﬀerential equations for the curvature,

kF (s), and the torsion, τF (s), of the centerline of an inhomogeneous rod, and

then impose the necessary conditions to ﬁnding circular/helical solutions.

Circular (ring) solutions have kF = Constant and τF = 0, while helical

solutions have the curvature and torsion of the rod centerline satisfying the

Lancret’s theorem: kF (s)/τF (s) is constant [29, 30]. The well known circular

helix is the particular case where both kF and τF are constant.

The fundamental theorem for space curves [30] states that the curvature

and the torsion completely determine a space curve, but for its position

in space. This is the reason for our choice of working with the curvature,

kF (s), and the torsion, τF (s), of the rod centerline. We shall show that the

solutions for kF (s) and τF (s) depend only on the bending coeﬃcient, B(s),

an expected result since the centerline of the rod does not depend on the

3

twisting coeﬃcient (see for instance, Neukirch and Henderson [31]).

In Sec. II we present the static Kirchhoﬀ equations for an intrinsically

straight rod with circular cross section and varying stiﬀness, and derive the

non-linear diﬀerential equations for the curvature and torsion of the rod. In

Sec. III we analyse the cases of null torsion (straight and planar rods). We

show that the ring solution of the static Kirchhoﬀ equations only exists for

a particular form of variation of the bending stiﬀness. In the case of twisted

rods with varying bending stiﬀness, this ring solution is the only possible

planar solution of the Kirchhoﬀ equations. In the case of non-twisted rods,

there exist other types of equilibrium planar solutions that depend on the

bending stiﬀness.

In Sec.

IV we use the Lancret’s theorem for obtaining

generalized helical solutions of the static Kirchhoﬀ equations. We show that

the circular helix is not an equilibrium solution of a rod that has non constant

bending stiﬀness. We obtain generalized helical solutions that depend on

the form of variation of the bending stiﬀness. As illustration, we compare

the helical solution of a homogeneous rod with two types of helical solutions

related to simple cases of inhomogeneous rods: (i) bending coeﬃcient varying

linearly, and (ii) bending varying periodically along the rod. In Sec. V we

discuss the main results and possible applications to DNA.

2 The static Kirchhoﬀ equations

The statics and dynamics of long, thin, inextensible and unshearable elastic

rods are described by the Kirchhoﬀ rod model.

In this model, the rod is

divided in segments of inﬁnitesimal thickness to which the Newton’s second

law for the linear and angular momenta are applied. We derive a set of

partial diﬀerential equations (PDE) for the averaged forces and torques on

each cross section and for a triad of vectors describing the shape of the rod.

The set of PDE are completed with a linear constitutive relation between

torque and twist.

The central axis of the rod, hereafter called centerline, is represented by

a space curve x parametrized by the arclength s. We commonly describe a

physical ﬁlament using a local basis, {d1, d2, d3}, which permits taking into

account the twist deformation of the ﬁlament. This local basis is deﬁned such

that d3 is the vector tangent to the centerline of the rod (d3 = t ≡ dx/ds),

and d1 and d2 lie on the cross section plane. The local basis is related to the

Frenet frame {n, b, t} of the centerline through

We are interested in the equilibrium solutions of the Kirchhoﬀ model, so

our study departs from the static Kirchhoﬀ equations [32]. For intrinsically

straight isotropic rods, these equations are:

F′

= 0 ,

M′ = F × d3 ,

M = B(s) k1 d1 + B(s) k2 d2 + C(s) k3 d3 ,

and ki → ki

, i = 1, 2, 3 .

(5)

the vectors F and M are the resultant force and the corresponding moment

with respect to the centerline of the rod, respectively, at a given cross section.

The prime ′ denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to s. ki are the components

of the twist vector, k, that controls the variations of the director basis along

the rod through the relation

d′
i = k × di ,

i = 1, 2, 3 .

(6)

k1 and k2 are related to the curvature of the centerline of the rod (kF =

k2
1 + k2

2) and k3 is the twist density. B(s) and C(s) are the bending and

p
twisting coeﬃcients of the rod, respectively. Writing the force F in the

6

director basis,

F = f1d1 + f2d2 + f3d3 ,

(7)

the equations (2–4) give the following diﬀerential equations for the compo-

nents of the force and twist vector:

f ′
1 − f2 k3 + f3 k2 = 0 ,

f ′
2 + f1 k3 − f3 k1 = 0 ,

f ′
3 − f1 k2 + f2 k1 = 0 ,

(B(s) k1)′ + (C(s) − B(s)) k2 k3 − f2 = 0 ,

(B(s) k2)

− (C(s) − B(s)) k1 k3 + f1 = 0 ,

′

(C(s) k3)′ = 0 .

The equation (13) shows that the component M3 = C(s) k3 of the moment in

the director basis (also called torsional moment), is constant along the rod,

consequently the twist density k3 is inversely proportional to the twisting

coeﬃcient C(s)

k3(s) =

M3
C(s)

.

In order to look for circular (ring) and helical solutions of the Eqs. (8–13)

the components of the twist vector k are expressed as follows:

k1 = kF (s) sin ξ ,

k2 = kF (s) cos ξ ,

(16)

k3 = ξ′ + τF (s) ,

(17)

where kF (s) and τF (s) are the curvature and torsion, respectively, of the rod

centerline, and ξ is given by Eq. (1).

Substituting Eqs.

(15–17) in Eqs.

(8–13), extracting f1 and f2 from

Eqs. (12) and (11), respectively, diﬀerentiating them with respect to s, and

substituting in Eqs. (8), (9) and (10), gives the following set of nonlinear

diﬀerential equations:

[M3 kF − B kF τF ]′ − (B kF )′ τF = 0 ,

(B kF )′′ + kF τF [M3 − B τF ] − f3 kF = 0 ,

(18)

(19)

(20)

where we have omitted the dependence on s to simplify the notation. Ap-

pendix A presents the details of the derivation of Eqs. (18–20).

The Eqs. (18–20) for the curvature, kF , and torsion, τF , do not depend

on the twisting coeﬃcient, C(s). Therefore, the centerline of an inhomo-

geneous rod does not depend on the twisting coeﬃcient unlike the case of

homogeneous rods (see, for example, Eqs. (13) and (14) of Ref. [31]).

Langer and Singer [33] have obtained a set of ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀeren-

tial equations for the curvature and torsion of the centerline of a homogeneous

rod that contains terms proportional to k2

F and τ 2

F . The Eqs. (18–20) have

the advantage of involving only terms linear in kF and τF .

3 Planar solutions of inhomogeneous rods

Planar solutions are obtained by setting τF = 0 in Eqs. (18-20). The result

M3 k′

F = 0 ,

(B kF )′′ − f3 kF = 0 ,

(B kF )′ kF + f ′

3 = 0 ,

Eq. (21) implies two diﬀerent sets of solutions: M3 6= 0 (twisted rods)

and M3 = 0 (non-twisted rods). Each case will be analysed separately.

3.1 Twisted rod: M3 6= 0

As (M3 6= 0), Eq. (21) leads to kF (s) = Constant ≡ K, which represents the

circular solution (also known as planar ring solution). Eqs. (22) and (23)

must be also satisﬁed, and their combination gives the following diﬀerential

equation for the bending stiﬀness B(s):

is:

or

= 0 ,

(cid:3)

B′′ + K 2B = Constant ≡ C0 ,

9

where we have set kF = K, and C0 is a constant of integration. Therefore,

the twisted (M3 6= 0) ring solution of an inhomogeneous rod only exists if

its bending stiﬀness satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation (25) (forced harmonic

oscillator). The bending stiﬀness (solution of (25)) can be written in the

form:

B(s) = A0 cos(K s) + B0 sin(K s) + C0/K 2 ,

(26)

with A0 and B0 arbitrary constants.

Therefore, only an intrinsically straight inhomogeneous twisted rod (M3 6=

0) with the bending stiﬀness given by Eq. (26), can display a planar ring

conﬁguration.

3.2 Non-twisted rod: M3 = 0

In this case, Eq. (21) is automatically satisﬁed so the curvature kF (s) does

not have to be constant.

From Eq. (22), we can obtain the following relation for f3(s):

f3(s) =

(BkF )′′
kF

.

(27)

Diﬀerentiating f3 with respect to s and substituting in Eq. (23), we obtain

the following non-linear diﬀerential equation for the curvature kF (s):

kF (BkF )′′′ − k′

F (BkF )′′ + k3

F (BkF )′ = 0 .

(28)

10

If kF = Constant ≡ K (the planar ring solution) the above equation gives

the following diﬀerential equation for B:

d
ds (cid:2)

B′′ + K 2B

= 0 ,

(cid:3)

(29)

which is the same Eq. (24) and, therefore, gives the same condition for B(s)

shown in Eq. (26). In this case, f3(s) is given by:

f3(s) = −K 2(A0 cos Ks + B0 sin Ks) .

(30)

So, the non-twisted planar ring (kF = Constant) is also an equilibrium

solution of the static Kirchhoﬀ equations if the bending stiﬀness of the inho-

mogeneous rod is given by Eq. (26).

Another solution of Eq. (28) for the curvature kF (s) comes from making

(BkF )′ = 0, which gives

kF (s) =

Constant
B(s)

,

(31)

and, from Eq. (27), f3(s) = 0.

It is a very interesting solution because it relates the curvature of the rod

centerline to the bending stiﬀness. Also, the component of the force tangent

to the rod centerline, f3, is null for the set of solutions satisfying Eq. (31).

In the particular case where B(s) is given by Eq. (26), we can have two

possible planar solutions: the planar ring kF (s) = K, and the solution for

11

which kF (s) is given by Eq. (31).

A kink is characterized by a piece of a ﬁlament having high curvature

kF (or small radius of curvature, R = 1/kF ). The Kirchhoﬀ approach is

not appropriate for modelling kinks in rods because in the derivation of the

Kirchhoﬀ equations it is assumed that the rod centerline radius of curva-

ture is much larger than the cross-section radius [20]. However, Haijun and

Zhong-can [34] used the Kirchhoﬀ rod model to show that variations in the

curvature of a closed rod may lead to instabilities responsible for the kink

formation. Within the limits of validity of the Kirchhoﬀ model, Eq. (31)

shows that pieces of a rod with small bending coeﬃcient may lead to equi-

librium conﬁgurations with large curvature. Therefore, our results can help

explaining the onset of formation of kinks, since variations in the curvature

of a ﬁlament can be originated by variations in the bending stiﬀness along it

(Eq. (31)). In Section V we comment on an application of this result to small

closed DNAs. Figure 1 illustrates a planar equilibrium solution given by Eq.

(31) in the case of a rod with periodic variation of its bending stiﬀness.

The straight rod (k1 = 0, k2 = 0) is a trivial solution of the static

Kirchhoﬀ equations, and is a particular case of planar solutions.

In the

inhomogeneous case, the twist density, k3, of the straight rod is not constant.

According to Eq. (14), for a given external torque, M3, the twist is large for

pieces of the rod where the twisting coeﬃcient, C, is small. This result could

help in determining the regions where plastic deformations or ruptures start

to occur in rods subjected to large stresses.

regions where the curvature is increased.

4 Helical solutions of inhomogeneous rods

In this section, we are considering the equilibrium solutions for the rod cen-

terline in which kF 6= 0 and τF 6= 0. In order to ﬁnd helical solutions for the

static Kirchhoﬀ equations, we apply the Lancret’s theorem to the equations

(18–20). We ﬁrst write the Lancret’s theorem in the form:

kF (s) = β τF (s) ,

where β 6= 0 is a constant. Substituting Eq. (32) in Eq. (18) we obtain

′
F (M3 − B τF ) − 2 τF (B τF )
τ

′

= 0 .

(32)

(33)

Substituting Eq. (32) in Eq. (19) and extracting f3, we obtain

f3 =

+ τF (M3 − B τF ) .

(34)

(B τF )′′
τF

Diﬀerentiating f3 with respect to s and substituting in Eq. (20) we obtain

the following diﬀerential equation for τF (s):

(35)

where Eq. (33) was used to simplify the above equation. One immediate

solution for this diﬀerential equation is

that substituted in Eq. (33) gives

For non-constant τF , the Eq. (37) gives the following solution for τF :

If M3 = 0, the only solution satisfying the Lancret theorem is τF (s) = 0

which is the planar solution given in the previous section. Substituting Eqs.

(B τF )′ = 0 ,

τ ′
F (M3 − BτF ) = 0 .

τF (s) =

M3
B(s)

.

14

(36)

(37)

(38)

(36) and (38) in Eq. (34) we obtain that

Substituting Eq. (38) in (32) we obtain:

f3(s) = 0 .

kF (s) =

βM3
B(s)

.

(39)

(40)

Substituting Eq. (1) in Eq. (7), the force F becomes

F = (f1 cos ξ − f2 sin ξ) n + (f1 sin ξ + f2 cos ξ) b + f3 t ,

(41)

where {n, b, t} is the Frenet basis. Using the Eqs. (57) and (58) for f1 and

f2 (Appendix A), we obtain

F = −(B kF )′ n + kF [M3 − B τF ] b + f3 t ,

(42)

where in the inhomogeneous case f3 must satisfy the Eq. (20).

Substituting Eqs. (38–40) in the Eq. (42), it follows F = 0. Therefore,

the helical solutions satisfying (36) are free standing.

Now, we show that a circular helix cannot be a solution of the static

Kirchhoﬀ equations for an intrinsically straight rod with non-constant bend-

ing stiﬀness. A circular helix has kF = Constant 6= 0, and τF = Constant

15

6= 0, in which case Eq. (18) gives:

2 kF τF B′ = 0 .

(43)

Since kF 6= 0 and τF 6= 0, Eq. (43) will be satisﬁed only if B′ = 0, implying

constant bending stiﬀness. Therefore, it is not possible to have a circular

helix as a solution for a rod having non-constant bending coeﬃcient.

The solution for the curvature kF , Eq. (40), and the torsion τF , Eq. (38),

can be used to obtain the unit vectors of the Frenet frame {n, b, t} through

the Frenet-Serret equations:

t′ = kF n ,

n′

= −kF t + τF b ,

b′ = −τf n .

By choosing the z-direction of the ﬁxed cartesian basis as the direction of

the helical axis, we can integrate t in order to obtain the three-dimensional

conﬁguration of the centerline of the rod.

rods with bending coeﬃcients given by

(49)

The case of constant bending (Eq. (47)) produces the well known circular

helix displayed in Fig. 2a, while Figs. 2b–2c display other helical structures

obtained for rods with non-constant bending coeﬃcients (Eqs.

(48–49)).

These structures are clearly not circular helices but as they satisfy the Lancret

theorem, Eq. (32), they are called generalized helices.

Theorem. (a) circular helix solution valid for a rod with constant bending
coeﬃcient Ba = 1 (47); (b) and (c) are generalized helices for inhomogeneous
rod with bending coeﬃcient given by Eqs. (48) and (49), respectively. The
parameters, in scaled units, are M3 = 0.05, and the total length of the rod
is L = 130. kF (0) = 0.24 for the helical solutions displayed in panels (a) and
(b), and kF (0) = 0.22 for panel (c).

The tridimensional helical conﬁgurations displayed in Fig. 2 were ob-

tained by integrating the Frenet-Serret equations (44-46) using the follow-

ing initial conditions for the Frenet frame: t(s = 0) = (0, sin α, cos α),

n(s = 0) = (−1, 0, 0) and b(s = 0) = (0, − cos α, sin α), where α represents

the angle between the tangent vector t and the helical axis. This choice

17

ensures that the z-axis is parallel to the direction of the helical axis. The

centerline of the helical rod is a space curve x(s) = (x(s), y(s), z(s)) that

is obtained by integration of the tangent vector t(s). We have placed the

initial position of the rod at x(0) = 1/k1(0), y(0) = 0 and z(0) = 0 (in scaled

units), where k1(0) is the curvature of the projection of the helical centerline

onto the plane perpendicular to the helical axis. It is possible to show [30]

that

x(0) =

1
k1(0)

=

kF (0) B2(0)
3 + k2

F (0)B2(0)

M 2

.

(50)

kF (0) and M3 are free parameters that have been chosen so that the helical

solutions displayed in Fig. 2 have the same angle α. The parameters kF (0) =

0.24 and M3 = 0.05 give x(0) ≃ 4 for the helical solutions displayed in Figs. 2a

and 2b, and the parameters kF (0) = 0.22 and M3 = 0.05 give x(0) ≃ 4.36

for the helical solution displayed in the Fig. 2c.

5 Conclusions

The existence of circular (planar ring) and helical conﬁgurations for a rod

with non-constant bending and twisting stiﬀnesses has been investigated

within the framework of the Kirchhoﬀ rod model. We are interested in ﬁnd-

ing analytical solutions, and since the static Kirchhoﬀ equations consist of

nine non-linear PDEs, we derived from them a set of diﬀerential equations

(Eqs. (18–20)) for the curvature, kF , and torsion, τF , of the rod centerline,

and then applied the geometric conditions to obtain circular and helical so-

18

lutions.

We have shown that the planar ring (kF = Constant) is an equilibrium

solution of the Kirchhoﬀ equations for an inhomogeneous rod which possesses

the bending stiﬀness, B(s), satisfying Eq. (26), and f3(s) satisfying Eq. (30).

The planar ring is the only planar solution for twisted rods (M3 6= 0). Non-

twisted rods (M3 = 0) may present other types of planar solutions with kF (s)

(non-constant) satisfying Eq. (28).

We also have shown that the circular helix is a solution of the static

Kirchhoﬀ equations only if the rod bending coeﬃcient B = Constant (see

Eq. (43)). An inhomogeneous rod has B 6= Constant, therefore it cannot

have a circular helix as equilibrium solution. Nevertheless, it can exhibit gen-

eralized helical structures that satisfy the Lancret’s theorem, Eq. (32). In the

Kirchhoﬀ model, these generalized helical solutions can be obtained solving

Eq. (35) for τF (s). Figure 2 displays three examples of helical structures

that satisfy the static Kirchhoﬀ equations.

May an intrinsically straight homogeneous elastic rod present other types

of generalized helical equilibrium solutions ? A homogeneous rod has C

constant, implying k3 = Constant (from Eq. (13)). It has been proved that

ξ′ = 0 for a helical solution of a homogeneous rod (see reference [35]), and

Eq. (17) shows that the torsion τF = k3 = Constant.

In order to satisfy

the Lancret’s theorem (Eq. (32)), the curvature kF of this helical solution

must also be constant. Since the helical structure whose curvature, kF , and

torsion, τF , are constant, is a circular helix, the only type of helical solution

19

for an intrinsically straight homogeneous rod is the circular helix.

Some motivations for this work are related to defects [36] and distor-

tions [37] in biological molecules. Also, the stiﬀness of the DNA molecule

has been proved to be sequence-dependent [3]. These defects, distortions and

sequence-dependent elastic properties could be modeled as inhomogeneities

along a continuous elastic rod.

Haijun and Zhong-can [34] have used the Goriely and Tabor stability

analysis method [22, 23] to explain the onset of instability in the phenomenon

of kink formation in small closed DNA molecules reported by Han et al [38,

39].

In the Han et al experiment [39], the DNA rings are immersed in a

solution containing Zn2+ or Mg2+ ions. They found that DNA rings become

kinked when the concentration of Zn2+ ions is above a critical value, with

or without the presence of Mg2+ which alone did not produce the kinking

phenomenon. Haijun and Zhong-can proposed that the binding of Zn2+ ions

to DNA basepairs enhance the intrinsic curvature of the DNA destabilizing

it. The Mg2+ ion, by binding to the phosphate backbone, did not produce

intrinsic curvature in the DNA molecules. Nevertheless, Haijun and Zhong-

can theory did not explain how the binding of Zn2+ ions lead to a variation

of the curvature of the closed DNA. Also, the asymmetries and positions of

the kinks in the DNA rings have not been explained.

Our approach can give a new insight to the phenomenon of kink formation

of these closed DNAs. Due to the binding of the Zn2+ ion to a basepair, the

bending stiﬀness of the DNA molecule should decrease locally, leading to a

local increase of curvature. On the other hand, the binding of the Mg2+ ion

to the phosphate backbone cannot change the stiﬀness of the molecule since

the phosphate backbone is a very rigid structure. Our model supports this

proposal since the equilibrium solutions represented by Eq. (31) show that

the curvature is inversely proportional to the bending stiﬀness. Also Eq.

(31) is only valid for a non-twisted rod which is the case of the DNA rings

reported in Ref. [38, 39].

Haijun and Zhong-can have shown that closed DNA with curvature above

a critical value never forms kinks in presence of Zn2+ or Mg2+ ions.

It

explains why Han et al [39] frequently observed kinks in closed DNAs of 168

basepairs (bps) long, while they rarely observed kinks in closed DNAs of 126-

bps long, independent of the presence of Zn2+ ions in the solution containing

the DNA rings. However, Haijun and Zhong-can approach cannot explain

the approximate elliptical shapes of the 126-bps circles observed by Han et

al [39]. Our results suggest that the non-circular shape of the 126-bps closed

DNAs is a consequence of the binding of Zn2+ ions to the basepairs that

decreases locally the stiﬀness of the DNA, thus increasing the curvature.

It has been proposed [40, 41, 42] that the kinking phenomenon is an im-

portant mechanism for wrapping DNA around nucleosomal proteins. In 1997,

Luger et al [43] reported the X-ray crystalline structure of the nucleosomal

protein, demonstrating that the DNA is not uniformly bent around nucleo-

some, but presents minimum and maximum curvatures at diﬀerent positions.

It is well known that the stiﬀness of DNA is sequence-dependent. Our results

21

show that the variation of the bending stiﬀness of the DNA can give rise to

these minimum and maximum curvatures.

A Appendix: The diﬀerential equations for

the curvature and torsion

Here, we shall derive the Eqs. (18–20). Substitution of Eqs. (15–17) into

Eqs. (8–13) gives:

1 − f2 (ξ′ + τF ) + f3 kF cos ξ = 0 ,
f ′

2 + f1 (ξ′ + τF ) − f3 kF sin ξ = 0 ,
f ′

f ′
3 − f1 kF cos ξ + f2 kF sin ξ = 0 ,

(B(s) kF sin ξ)′ + (C(s) − B(s)) kF cos ξ (ξ′ + τF ) − f2 = 0 ,

(B(s) kF cos ξ)′ − (C(s) − B(s)) kF sin ξ (ξ′ + τF ) + f1 = 0 ,

(C(s) (ξ

+ τF ))

= 0 .

First, we extract f1 and f2 from Eqs. (55) and (54), respectively:

f1 = −(B(s) kF )′ cos ξ + [M3 kF − B(s) kF τF ] sin ξ ,

f2 = (B(s) kF )′ sin ξ + [M3 kF − B(s) kF τF ] cos ξ ,

(57)

(58)

where M3 = C(s) (ξ′ +τF ) is the torsional moment of the rod that is constant

by Eq. (56). Diﬀerentiating f1 and f2 with respect to s, substituting in Eqs.

(51) and (52), respectively, and using Eqs. (57) and (58), gives the following

equations:

{−(B(s) kF )′′ − τF [M3 kF − B(s) kF τF ] + f3 kF } cos ξ +

{[M3 kF − B(s) kF τF ]′ − τF (B(s) kF )′} sin ξ = 0 ,

{(B(s) kF )′′ + τF [M3 kF − B(s) kF τF ] − f3 kF } sin ξ +

{[M3 kF − B(s) kF τF ]′ − τF (B(s) kF )′} cos ξ = 0 .

(59)

(60)

Multiplying Eq. (59) (Eq. (60)) by sin ξ (cos ξ) and then adding the resulting

equations, we obtain the Eq. (18) for the curvature and torsion:

[M3 kF − B kF τF ]′ − (B kF )′τF = 0 .

(61)

Multiplying Eq. (59) (Eq. (60)) by − cos ξ (+ sin ξ) and then adding the

resulting equations, we obtain the Eq. (19):

(B kF )′′ + kF τF (M3 − BτF ) − f3 kF = 0 .

(62)

23

Finally, the Eq. (20) is obtained by substituting Eqs. (57) and (58) in Eq.

(B kF )′ + f ′

3 = 0 .

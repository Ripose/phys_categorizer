Abstract. Homogenization theory is used to calculate the macroscopic dielectric constant from the quantum
microscopic dielectric function in a periodic medium. The method can be used to calculate any macroscopic
constitutive relation, but it is illustrated here for the case of electrodynamics of matter. The so-called cell
problem of homogenization theory is solved and an explicit expression is given for the macroscopic dielectric
constant in a form akin to the Clausius-Mossotti or Lorentz-Lorenz relation. The validity of this expression
is checked by showing that the macroscopic dielectric constant is causal and has the expected symmetry
properties, and that the average of the microscopic energy density is the macroscopic one. Finally, the
general expression is applied to Bloch eigenstates. Finally, the corresponding many-body problem is brieﬂy
discussed.

1 Introduction

When light falls onto a crystal, the quantum interaction of
light with matter is represented locally by a microscopic
dielectric function ǫ(r, r′). To calculate the macroscopic
(homogeneous) dielectric constant, one considers that the
charge distribution created by the light polarizes the crys-
tal which, in turn, reacts by inducing an electric ﬁeld that
modiﬁes the charge distribution.

In quantum chemistry, this reaction ﬁeld represents
the inﬂuence of the solvent on the solute [1,2,3]. Other
descriptions use the related concept of local ﬁelds [4,5],
which has been described, for disordered media, by a clus-
ter expansion [6,7,8,9].

For periodic media, the local ﬁeld eﬀect was evaluated
in the early sixties by Adler [10] and Wiser [11]. How-
ever, many textbooks in solid-state physics still identify
the macroscopic dielectric constant ¯ǫ with hǫi, the aver-
age of the microscopic dielectric function ǫ(r, r′) over a
unit cell. Even the most cautious authors [12,13,14] do
not go beyond the relation ¯ǫ = ǫ0(ǫ0 + 2hǫi)/(4ǫ0 − hǫi),
that goes by the name of Clausius-Mossotti or Lorentz-
Lorenz (see Refs.[15,16,17] for a history of this relation).
Since the local ﬁeld eﬀect can be quite large [18], its ne-
glect can probably be attributed to the numerical burden
of the standard local ﬁeld formula [10,11].

In this paper, homogenization theory will be used to
provide various alternative formulas for the calculation of
the local ﬁeld eﬀects. Homogenization theory is tailored to
calculate the macroscopic ¯ǫ from the microscopic ǫ(r, r′).

The major trick of the method is to expand all ﬁelds as
a series in ascending powers of the ratio of the lattice pa-
rameter over the wavelength of the external electromag-
netic ﬁeld. Physicists have sometimes used such an expan-
sion [19], but mathematicians exploited it extensively and
turned it into a rigorous tool. Homogenization theory is
a branch of applied mathematics that started its expan-
sion in the late seventies [20,21] to understand the macro-
scopic properties of composite, porous, disordered, bub-
bly, ﬁbrous or layered materials. It is now a fully ﬂedged
theory [22] that has been applied successfully in many
areas, such as mechanics, acoustics, electrostatics, ﬂuid
dynamics, statistical physics, numerical analysis, materi-
als sciences, electromagnetism [23], petroleum geophysics
[24], shape-memory alloys [25] and pile foundation analy-
sis [26].

This paper starts with an introduction to homogeniza-
tion theory, then the microscopic Maxwell equations are
homogenized to yield the macroscopic Maxwell equations
and the constitutive relations. Since homogenization the-
ory is not a usual tool of solid state physics, the calcula-
tions in these sections will be given in detail. The rest of
the article will follow the elliptic style of normal research
papers. Various formulas will be given, corresponding to
diﬀerent physical situations. Then, several desirable prop-
erties of the dielectric constant will be derived. It will be
shown that the macroscopic dielectric constant is causal,
has the proper symmetry properties and gives the ex-
pected energy density and Poynting vector. The formalism

is adapted to the case of Bloch eigenstates and a band-
structure formula for ¯ǫ is given. Finally, the much simpler
case of the many-body dielectric function is brieﬂy dis-
cussed.

2 The point of view of homogenization theory

Ever since the nineteenth century, physicists have homog-
enized microscopic systems by performing averages over
distances very small compared to the macroscopic wave-
length and very large compared to the atomic dimensions.
Mathematical homogenization started when homogeniza-
tion was not considered any longer as an averaging op-
eration, but as a limit process. As an example, consider
that a microscopic quantity can be represented by the pe-
riodic function f (x) = sin x + b. To express the fact that
the oscillation is very fast, mathematicians tried to give a
meaning to the limit of f (x/a) as a → 0. In other words,
what is the limit of a periodic function when its period
becomes inﬁnitely small ?

The contact with the physical point of view comes from
the fact that the limit is the average of f (x) over a pe-
riod : f (x/a) → b as a → 0. However, ﬁgure 1 shows that
this limit is somewhat unusual. Physicists generally do not
bother very much with the various mathematical limits,
but in the present case, it is necessary to realize that we
do not deal with a strong limit, but with a weak limit.
Strong convergence of f (x) to its limit b, which means
L
that, for a ﬁxed L,
0 dx|f (x/a) − b| → 0 as a → 0, is
clearly not realized for oscillating functions (for our ex-
L
ample,
0 dx|f (x/a) − b| → 2L/π). Oscillating functions
enjoy only weak convergence, which is deﬁned by the fact
L
that, for any smooth function g(x),
0 dxg(x)f (x/a) →
L
R
b
0 dxg(x) as a → 0. In physical terms, the fast oscilla-
tions of f (x/a) are smoothed away by measuring f (x/a)
R
with a device having a ﬁnite resolution g(x).

Strong convergence enjoys many nice properties, for
instance the product of two strongly convergent functions

converges to the product of the limits, but no such thing is
available for weak convergence. In our example, the weak
limit of f 2(x/a) is b2 + 1/2 and not b2. Since it is clear
that the average of the product of two functions is not
the product of the averages of the functions, the reader
may wonder why it is useful to consider homogenization
as a limit instead of an average. The advantage of homog-
enization as a limit is twofold. On the ﬁrst hand, it leads
naturally to an asymptotic expansion of the functions in
terms of a (i.e. f (x/a) → b + af (1)(x/a) + · · ·), so that
corrections to the average become available. On the other
hand, it enables us to treat not only functions but also
diﬀerential equations.

The way mathematical homogenization deals with dif-
ferential equations can be illustrated by a simple exam-
ple [20]. Consider a wire of length L, uniformly charged
with a constant charge density n. A potential V is applied
between both ends of the wire, and the wire is assumed
to have a periodic structure represented by the periodic
dielectric function ǫ(x/a). Standard electrostatic theory
tells us that there is a potential φ(x) such that the elec-
tric ﬁeld e(x) = −φ′(x). The microscopic constitutive re-
lation is d(x) = ǫ(x/a)e(x), and the electrostatic equa-
tion d′(x) = n gives us the equation (ǫ(x/a)φ′(x))′ = −n,
with the boundary conditions φ(0) = 0, φ(L) = V . For
simplicity, we assume that L corresponds to an integer
number of periods 2πa. This electrostatic equation has
a unique solution φ(x) for each a (that can be obtained
explicitly). From the explicit solution, it can be shown
that φ(x) tends weakly to a function Φ(x) when a tends
to zero (with respect to the wire length L). The purpose
of homogenization theory is to answer the question: to
which diﬀerential equation is Φ(x) a solution? Again, the
explicit solution can be used to show that Φ(x) is the so-
lution of (¯ǫΦ′(x))′ = −n, with Φ(0) = 0, Φ(L) = V and ¯ǫ
is a constant. The surprising fact is that ¯ǫ is not given by
the average of ǫ(x) over a period, but by the inverse of the
average of 1/ǫ(x) over a period. However, such a simple re-
lation between ǫ(x) and ¯ǫ is restricted to one-dimensional
problems, and more work is required in three dimensions.
More generally, for a diﬀerential equation with rapidly
oscillating coeﬃcients, homogenization theory determines
whether the solution has a limit when the period tends to
zero, and to which equation the limit is a solution. This
is exactly what we need to derive constitutive relations
from a microscopic description of matter. Homogenization
theory has shown that the macroscopic equation can be
strongly diﬀerent from the microscopic one. For instance,
instantaneous microscopic equations can turn into equa-
tions with memory [27,28], local equations can develop
non-local macroscopic terms [29], mixtures of optically in-
active materials can become optically active [30,31]

3 Functional transformations

In this section, some functional transformations are intro-
duced.

For the purpose of homogenization, a function f (r)
is written as f(R, ρ), where the dependence of f is slow

Fig. 2. P and P ′ are two points in the same cell, P and P ′′
are separated by a lattice vector

for the variable R and periodic for the variable ρ. This
so-called two-scale correspondence can be done explicitly
as follows. Take a three-dimensional periodic lattice with
Brillouin zone BZ. Let C be the Wigner-Seitz cell of the
lattice and |C| its volume. The crystal sites will be denoted
by Rs, and the reciprocal lattice vectors by K.

for q /∈ BZ

Then it is clear that f (r) = f(r, r), so that

f (r) =

dq exp(iq · r)˜f(q, r).

ZBZ

f(R, ρ) has the lattice periodicity in ρ and depends
more slowly on R than on ρ. More precisely, homogeniza-
tion is useful when the function f (r) varies slowly from
P to P ′′ (see Fig.2), i.e. for two points that diﬀer by a
(short) lattice vector and varies arbitrarily from P to P ′
inside a cell. Then f (r) is transformed into f(R, ρ), the ρ
variable describes the fast variation of the function inside

the cell, and the R variable its smooth variation from cell
to cell.

This representation of a function of one variable by a
function of a fast periodic variable ρ and a slower variable
R is the essence of the two scale analysis of homogeniza-
tion theory.

We shall not homogenize the Maxwell equations with
the usual two-scale function f(R, ρ), but with its Fourier
transform with respect to the slow variable R: ˜f(q, ρ). To
establish a direct link between ˜f(q, ρ) and f (r) and for
future reference, we shall make use of the standard rela-
tions for inﬁnite Born-von K´arm´an boundary conditions

mula [33]):

Since q is in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, the average over
a unit cell has the eﬀect of stripping all the high fre-
quency components oﬀ the Fourier transform of f . We
shall use this average to go from microscopic to macro-
scopic ﬁelds. The macroscopic ﬁelds will be microscopic
ﬁelds averaged over a unit cell, so that all Fourier com-
ponents of the macroscopic ﬁelds are zero when the argu-
ment is outside the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. This deﬁnition
of macroscopic ﬁelds is common in the physical litera-
ture [10,11,15,34,35,36]. Notice also that hf(R, ρ)i and
h˜f(q, ρ)i are Fourier transforms of one another. Therefore,
the macroscopic ﬁelds E(R) and E(q) obtained by aver-
aging the corresponding microscopic ﬁelds remain Fourier
transforms of one another.

By direct substitution, it can be shown that the two-
scale transforms of the gradient of f are (∇R + ∇ρ)f(R, ρ)
and (iq + ∇ρ)˜f(q, ρ).

4 The microscopic Maxwell equations

To simplify the presentation, we consider a non magnetic
sample and we neglect the eﬀect of spin (see Ref.[5] for the
full theory). Moreover, the electromagnetic charges, cur-
rents and ﬁelds have a time dependence exp(−iωt) which
will be implicit for notational convenience.

The random phase approximation of quantum electro-
dynamics corresponds to the following picture [34]. An
external electromagnetic wave Eext(r), Bext(r) polarizes
the dielectric crystal, creating a current density j(r) and a
charge density n(r). These current and charge induce an
electric ﬁeld e(r) − Eext(r) and a magnetic ﬁeld b(r) −
Bext(r), that induce additional current and charge, etc.
When the medium and the ﬁeld reach equilibrium, the
vacuum (rationalized SI) Maxwell equations describe the
connection between the total ﬁelds and the induced charge
and current densities:

∇ · e(r) = n(r)/ǫ0
∇ × e(r) = iωb(r)
∇ · b(r) = 0

where n0(r) is the charge density in the ground state, e is
the (negative) electron charge and m its mass. The veloc-
ity matrix elements are

V0n(r) = −

[Ψ ∗

0 (r)∇rΨn(r) − Ψn(r)∇rΨ ∗

0 (r)], (7)

i¯h
2m

where Ψ0(r) and Ψn(r) are eigenstates of the crystal. In the
one-electron case, the sum is carried out over the occupied
(0) and unoccupied (n) states.

In expression (6), the ﬁrst term, called the diamagnetic
term, depends only on the electronic density, and the sec-
ond (paramagnetic) term is usually much larger than the
ﬁrst in the optical range [5].

Formula (6) for the susceptibility χ holds at zero tem-
perature. The corresponding formula for ﬁnite tempera-
ture involves a weighted sum over initial states [5]. All
the results of the present paper can be straightforwardly
adapted to the ﬁnite temperature case.

From the microscopic current j(r) it is customary in di-
electric theory to deﬁne the polarization p(r) = (i/ω)j(r)
and the displacement ﬁeld d(r) = ǫ0e(r) + p(r). In terms
of those ﬁelds, the microscopic Maxwell equations become

∇ × e(r) = iωb(r)
∇ · b(r) = 0
∇ · d(r) = 0
∇ × b(r) = −iωµ0d(r),

(8)

where the microscopic constitutive relation is now

di(r) = ǫ0ei(r) +

dr′χij (r, r′)ej(r′).

Z

Xj

The microscopic ﬁelds e(r), b(r) and p(r) are, as the
susceptibility χij (r, r′), rapidly oscillating functions of r.
The macroscopic ﬁelds E(R), B(R) and P(R) are aver-
ages of the corresponding quantities over a unit cell. The
constitutive relations problem is how to go from the re-
lation between p(r) and e(r) to a relation between P(R)
and E(R). Homogenization theory is a very convenient
way to solve this problem.

∇ × b(r) + iωǫ0µ0e(r) = µ0j(r),

where charge conservation implies ∇ · j(r) = iωn(r).

5 Homogenization of the microscopic
Maxwell equations

The derivation of the macroscopic Maxwell equations from
the microscopic ones is standard [12,15,40]. Hence, the
purpose of this section is just to show that homogeniza-
tion theory gives the known results and to derive equations
that will be used in the next sections. The homogeniza-
tion of the Maxwell equation has been thoroughly studied
by applied mathematicians [20,21,22,27,41,42,43,44,45,
46,47] and physicists [30,31]. However, the microscopic
constitutive relations that they used were always local:
χij(r, r′) = χij(r)δ(r − r′). We do not need the full appa-
ratus of homogenization theory of non-local equations [48]
and we homogenize the Maxwell equations by a simple

Christian Brouder, St´ephanie Rossano: Microscopic Calculation of the Constitutive Relations

5

adaptation of the method used for local dielectric func-
tions.

In this section, we follow the very clear homogenization
procedure of Sanchez-Palencia [21], except that we work
with ˜f(q, ρ) instead of f(R, ρ).

Using the fact that the two-scale transform of ∇f (r)
is (iq + ∇ρ)˜f(q, ρ), we can make the two-scale transform
of the Maxwell equations (8) to obtain:

iq × e(q, ρ) + ∇ρ × e(q, ρ) = iωb(q, ρ)

iq · b(q, ρ) + ∇ρ · b(q, ρ) = 0
iq · d(q, ρ) + ∇ρ · d(q, ρ) = 0

iq × b(q, ρ) + ∇ρ × b(q, ρ) = −iωµ0d(q, ρ).

(9)

For notational convenience, we do not write the ﬁelds
e(q, ρ), etc, with a tilde.

Because they vary slowly, the eventual “external” cur-
rents and charges would appear as j(q) and n(q), with no
dependence on ρ.

Consider a scattering problem where a plane electro-
magnetic wave is shined on the dielectric. In equations (9),
the order of magnitude of q will be 2π/λ, where λ is the
wavelength of the incident wave. The order of magnitude
of the unit cell dimensions is l = |C|1/3. Let a = l/λ, the
order of magnitude of ∇ρ · e(q, ρ) is 1/a times the order of
magnitude of q · e(q, ρ). Now we expand all ﬁelds as sums
of the type

e(q, ρ) = e(0)(q, ρ) + ae(1)(q, ρ) + a2e(2)(q, ρ) + · · ·(10)

where all terms of the expansion are periodic in ρ. Since
a is small, we keep only the ﬁrst term of the expansion to
deﬁne the macroscopic ﬁelds as E(q) = he(0)(q, ρ)i, etc.
The validity [49] and asymptotic convergence of this ex-
pansion is the main technical diﬃculty that was solved by
the mathematicians who homogenized the Maxwell equa-
tions (see, for instance, Ref.[44] where the general term
of expansion (10) is given). To be complete, we need to
know that the order of magnitude of ω is 2πc/λ, the order
of manitude of b is e/c and the order of magnitude of d
is ǫ0e.

Introducing the expansions (10) into Eq.(9) and gath-
ering all terms of same power of a we obtain four equations
for the a−1 term:

∇ρ × e(0)(q, ρ) = 0
∇ρ · b(0)(q, ρ) = 0
∇ρ · d(0)(q, ρ) = 0
∇ρ × b(0)(q, ρ) = 0,

and four equations for the a0 term:

iq × e(0)(q, ρ) + a∇ρ × e(1)(q, ρ) = iωb(0)(q, ρ)

iq · b(0)(q, ρ) + a∇ρ · b(1)(q, ρ) = 0
iq · d(0)(q, ρ) + a∇ρ · d(1)(q, ρ) = 0

iq × b(0)(q, ρ) + a∇ρ × b(1)(q, ρ) = −iωµ0d(0)(q, ρ),

(recall that a∇ρ has the same order of magnitude as q).
These two sets of equations are suﬃcient to determine the
macroscopic Maxwell equations. Further terms would be
required if the wavelength were not very large with respect
to the unit cell dimensions.

To obtain the macroscopic Maxwell equations, we must
eliminate the terms of order one, e.g. b(1)(q, ρ). This is
achieved by transforming the cell average of the divergence
into an integral over the surface ∂C of the unit cell: h∇ρ ·
∂C ˆn · b(1)(q, ρ)dS. On opposite sides
b(1)(q, ρ)i = 1/|C|
of cell C, the outgoing normal ˆn is reversed while b(1)(q, ρ)
R
is equal (by periodicity). Therefore, the surface integral is
zero and h∇ρ · b(1)(q, ρ)i = 0. A similar reasoning leads
to h∇ρ × b(1)(q, ρ)i = 0.

Thus, averaging Eq.(12) gives 0 = iq · hb(0)(q, ρ)i +
ah∇ρ·b(1)(q, ρ)i = iq·B(q), because the macroscopic ﬁeld
B(q) was deﬁned as the average of b(0)(q, ρ). Carrying
out similar calculations for the other microscopic Maxwell
equations we obtain the macroscopic Maxwell equations
in momentum space:

iq × E(q) = iωB(q)
iq · B(q) = 0
iq · D(q) = 0
iq × B(q) = −iωµ0D(q).

(13)

Fourier transforming back to real space we obtain the
usual macroscopic Maxwell equations:

∇ × E(R) = iωB(R)
∇ · B(R) = 0
∇ · D(R) = 0
∇ × B(R) = −iωµ0D(R).

Notice that this homogenization procedure can be ap-
plied directly to Eqs.(9), but the present formulation is
required for consistency with the derivation of the consti-
tutive relations.

Homogenization now proceeds classically. We start by
homogenizing the magnetic ﬁeld b(0)(q, ρ). From the equa-
tion ∇ρ × b(0)(q, ρ) = 0 we deduce that there is a pe-
riodic potential φ(q, ρ) and a function of q, denoted by
F(q), such that b(0)(q, ρ) = F(q) − ∇ρφ(q, ρ). Taking
the average of both sides, and considering the periodic-
ity of φ we obtain hb(0)(q, ρ)i = F(q) [50] and, since the
left-hand side is deﬁned as the macroscopic magnetic ﬁeld
B(q), we get b(0)(q, ρ) = B(q) − ∇ρφ(q, ρ). Introduc-
ing this equality into ∇ρ · b(0)(q, ρ) = 0 we obtain the
equation ∆ρφ(q, ρ) = 0. The only periodic solution of the
Laplace equation is a constant [20], so φ(q, ρ) is a constant
and b(0)(q, ρ) = B(q). In other words, the magnetic ﬁeld
does not need to be averaged, the zero-th order term of
b(q, ρ) is smooth and does not depend on ρ. The periodic
modulation is only reached at the next and smaller term
ab(1)(q, ρ).

Such an automatic averaging is not possible for the
electric ﬁeld. Starting from ∇ρ × e(0)(q, ρ) = 0, the only
conclusion that we can reach at this level is that there is

(11)

(12)

6

a periodic potential φ(q, ρ) such that e(0)(q, ρ) = E(q) −
∇ρφ(q, ρ). The determination of φ will be the purpose of
the next sections, but this result has already an interest-
ing meaning. The zero-th term of the expansion of e(q, ρ)
is not smooth. In mathematical terms, the limit of e(q, ρ)
as a → 0 is still an oscillating function, contrary to our ex-
ample f (x/a) = sin(x/a) + b. This concept of “oscillating
limit” was introduced by the Cameroonese mathematician
G. Nguetseng in 1989 [51] and has deeply simpliﬁed ho-
mogenization theory [52].

6 The constitutive relation

Still, to give a complete description of the macroscopic
electromagnetic properties of matter, we have to establish
a correspondence between D(q) and E(q).

To do this, we use the periodicity of χ: for every lattice
vector R, χij(r + R, r′ + R) = χij (r, r′) [37]. Notice that
the same lattice vector must be added to both arguments
of χ.

We start from the relation between the polarization

and the electric ﬁeld

p(r) =

dr′χ(r, r′) · e(r′).

Then, we apply the two-scale transformation Eq.(3) to

It can be checked that ˜χ(ρ, ρ′; q) has the lattice peri-
odicity for each variable ρ and ρ′ independently. A related
deﬁnition was used by Ehrenreich [34].

All quantities are now periodic and diagonal in q: they
are in a suitable form for homogenization. From the rela-
tion between polarization and electric ﬁeld, we deduce the
relation between displacement and electric ﬁeld which will
be our starting point:

di(q, ρ) = ǫ0ei(q, ρ) +

h ˜χij (ρ, ρ′; q)ej(q, ρ′)iρ′ . (15)

The macroscopic constitutive relation is obtained by
restricting all ﬁelds to the ﬁrst term of expansion (10). If
we do this in Eq.(15) and write the electric ﬁeld as the

Following Wiser [11], a connexion with the classical
approach is possible through the introduction of a macro-
scopic local ﬁeld Eloc(q) deﬁned by

so that D(q) = ǫ0E(q) + h ˜χ(ρ, ρ′; q)iρρ′ · Eloc(q).

The next step is the determination of φ(q, ρ′). We take
the microscopic equation ∇ρ · d(0)(q, ρ) = 0 derived in the

This so-called cell equation determines a unique periodic
solution φ(q, ρ) with zero average over a period.

We follow ﬁrst the standard argument of homogeniza-
tion theory. Let the three functions Ak(q, ρ) (k = x, y, z)
be the solutions of the cell equation for an electric ﬁeld
E equal to a unit vector in the direction k. Then, for
a general electric ﬁeld E(q), the potential is φ(q, ρ) =
A(q, ρ) · E(q).

If we introduce this expression for φ(q, ρ) into Eq.(17),
we obtain the macroscopic constitutive relation Di(q) =
j ǫij (q)Ej (q) where the macroscopic dielectric constant

ǫij(q) is given by
P

The last term is minus the right-hand side of Eq.(18).
This periodic charge induces an additional electric ﬁeld,
that creates an additional polarization, and φ(q, ρ) is the
periodic potential (with zero average) which represents
the local electric ﬁeld reached at equilibrium under the
inﬂuence of the external ﬁeld E(q). In other words, the cell
equation (18) is the electrostatic equation for the potential
created in a unit cell of the dielectric by an external ﬁeld
E(q).

With this picture in mind, we can solve the cell equa-
tion iteratively. We need the periodic electrostatic Green
function G#(ρ) which is a solution of ǫ0∆G#(ρ) = −δ(ρ)
in a unit cell. Some properties of G#(ρ) are discussed in
Ref.[22], p.121,

This equation shows that the macroscopic dielectric
constant is the average of the microscopic dielectric func-
tion plus a correction term. In the case when the dielec-
tric function is a sum of constant factors localized at all
sites of a cubic lattice, it is standard exercice of homog-
enization theory to show that the macroscopic constitu-
tive relation becomes the Clausius-Mossotti equation (see
Ref.[22], p.45). Therefore, the correction term can be quite
large and should not be neglected.

Homogenization usually stops here, and the integro-
diﬀerential cell equation (18) can only be solved numeri-
cally, which seems to be a reasonable task. For instance,
the FLAPW approach could be used, where space is cut
into non-overlapping spheres plus an interstitial region.
φ(q, ρ) is then expanded over spherical harmonics (with
suitable radial functions) in the spheres and over plane
waves exp(iK · ρ) in the interstitial region. This reduces
the cell equation to a matrix equation.

However, the particular structure of χij(r, r′) can be
used to give an explicit solution for φ(q, ρ). This is the
purpose of the next section.

7 The cell problem

The cell equation (18) can be interpreted as follows. If
a constant electric ﬁeld E(q) is applied to the dielectric,
linear response theory tells us that it induces a periodic
current given by Eq. (5)

or

j(q, ρ) = −iωh ˜χ(ρ, ρ′; q)iρ′ · E(q)

and the corresponding periodic charge is

In this section, some basic consequences of the macro-
scopic constitutive relations are derived. Firstly, we show
how the usual concept of electric dipole transition is re-
covered, then that the macroscopic constitutive relations
are causal and have the required symmetry properties. Fi-
nally we prove that the average of the microscopic energy
density is given by the macroscopic energy density and we
discuss the reaction ﬁeld matrix.

Equations (23) and (24), giving an explicit expression
for the macroscopic dielectric constant, are the main result
of the paper. These equations can be useful when only a
few states n contribute to the susceptibility χ(ρ, ρ′; q)

Integrating Eq.(24) by parts and using the periodicity
of all functions involved, we can derive an alternative form
for the reaction ﬁeld matrix M (q)nn′ , which decreases the
singularity of the derivative of G#:

M (q)nn′ = −|C|hG#(ρ − ρ′)∇ρ · gn(ρ, q)∇ρ′ · f n

An alternative summation of the series (20) can be
obtained by separating G#(ρ − ρ′) with Eq.(19). A calcu-

The notation

′ means that the sum is over all non-
zero reciprocal lattice vectors. To show that the terms
K = 0 or K′ = 0 do no contribute, we reintroduce the
inﬁnitesimal number −iη of Eq.(19) and, for instance, the
K′ = 0 term gives us (i/η)h∇ρ · ˜χ(ρ, ρ′; q)iρρ′ = 0, because
the average of a divergence is zero [50]. Similarly, NKK′ is
zero for K = 0 or K′ = 0. The last expression for ǫ(q) is
computationnaly eﬀective when χ(ρ, ρ′; q) is smooth and
only a few K contribute.

Notice that Eq.(26) amounts to using the Fourier trans-
form of the susceptibility ˜χij(ρ, ρ′; q). We do not discuss
this approach further, since it has been used by many au-
thors [10,11,19,55,56]. It can be checked that Eq.(26) is
equivalent their results, in the limit where a → 0.

Equation (27) is typical of a homogeneous (but gen-
erally anisotropic) medium [37]. The fact that Eq.(27)
is non-local corresponds to spatial dispersion, which has
been much studied by the Russian school [37], and has
received renewed interest recently [57,58,59,60]. Besides,
the q-dependence of ǫij(q) can be observed experimen-
tally by inelastic electron, x-ray or neutron scattering [61,
62,63]. In Eq.(28), it is not necessary to restrict the inte-
gral to the ﬁrst Brillouin zone since, by deﬁnition, ǫij(q)
is zero outside this zone.

If ǫij(q) is smooth near q = 0, it can be expanded in

a Taylor series

ǫij(q) = ǫij (0) +

Xkl

The ﬁrst term corresponds to the electric dipole ap-
proximation, the second term describes optical activity,
the following term corresponds to electric quadrupole and
magnetic dipole transitions. When only the ﬁrst term is
kept, then Eq.(28) becomes ¯ǫij(r−r′) = ǫij(0)δ(r−r′) and
the constitutive relation is now local D(r) = ǫ(0) · E(r).

8.2 Causality

A susceptibility is causal if it satisﬁes the Kramers-Kronig
relations, that we write in the following form [40]

˜χ(ω) =

˜χ(ω′)

dω′.

(29)

Because of the structure (6), the microscopic suscepti-
bility χ(r, r′; ω) is causal. Thus, by linearity, its two-scale

Christian Brouder, St´ephanie Rossano: Microscopic Calculation of the Constitutive Relations

transform ˜χ(ρ, ρ′; q, ω) is causal. To be valid, the macro-
scopic susceptibility (23) has also to be causal.

Starting from Eq.(29), it can be shown by recurrence

that, for any integer n > 0,

˜χn(ω) =

+∞

If we write Eq.(21) in simpliﬁed notation as

¯χ(ω) = h ˜χ(ω)i +

h ˜χ(ω) · ∇G#∇ · ˜χ(ω)i + · · · , (31)

1
|C|

we can apply the Kramers-Kronig transform to the right-
hand side of Eq.(31). Then, Eq.(30) shows that each term
of the right-hand side is transformed into itself by the
Kramers-Kronig transform. Therefore

¯χ(ω) =

˜χij(ρ, ρ′; q) =

Dii′ Djj′ ˜χi′j′ (T −1ρ, T −1ρ′; Dq).(33)

Xi′j′

The ﬁnal step is to replace all the ˜χ in the right-hand
side of Eq.(21) by the right-hand side of Eq.(33). For all
integrals we make the change of variable ρ = T −1ρ, then
we use the fact that G#(T ρ − T ρ′) = G#(ρ − ρ′), the
identity ∂ρi /∂ρ
= Dij , the orthogonality of D and the
periodicity of all functions involved to prove that

the expected result

and the macroscopic constitutive relation is causal.

might be non-causal for ω = 0.

8.3 Symmetry

To assert the validity of our result, it is important to check
that the symmetry group of the macroscopic dielectric
constant is the point group of the crystal space group.

Because of the periodicity of χ(r, r′), the lattice trans-
lations do not intervene. The other symmetry operations
of the crystal are T = D + t, where D is a (possibly im-
proper) rotation and t is a translation shorter than the
lattice vectors. Let T be a crystal symmetry operation,
there is a basis of eigenstates Ψn(r) such that

Ψn(r) = T Ψn(r) = Ψn(T −1r).

Using this property we obtain the following transforma-
tion rule for χ(r, r′) [65,66]

χij (r, r′) =

Dii′ Djj′ χi′j′ (T −1r, T −1r′).

(32)

Xi′j′

The presence of the matrices Dii′ comes from the deriva-
tives in deﬁnition (7), which get rid of the translation part
of T .

T −1ρ′+D−1Rs), we use the fact that, for any space group,

energy density. If this were not the case, the energy ar-
guments using the macroscopic Maxwell equations would
lack any microscopic basis.

For the Poynting vector, the answer is immediately yes,
because we have shown that b(0)(q, ρ) = B(q). Therefore
b(0)(r, t) = B(r, t), the magnetic ﬁeld does not oscillate
rapidly, it is equal to its average and

hs(r, t)i =

The proof is similar for the magnetic part of the en-
ergy density. However, the problem is more diﬃcult for
the electric part, because it is a product of two functions
that oscillate very rapidly, and it is not obvious that the
average of the product is equal to the product of the av-
erages. We prove now that the average of the microscopic
energy density is indeed given by the usual macroscopic
formula.

First, we Fourier transform the ﬁelds in space and time

8.5 Reaction ﬁeld matrix

It is also possible to integrate by parts to apply both
gradients to the Green function, but the double gradi-
ent of the Green function has a singularity that must be
treated with care [69,70]. On the other hand, this form
has the advantage of recovering the usual dipole-dipole
interaction of classical dielectric theory [15] as will be
shown now. In Eq.(24), an integration by parts trans-
j (ρ′, q) to G#(ρ − ρ′), then
fers the derivative ∂ρ′
G#(ρ − ρ′) = −∂ρj G#(ρ − ρ′). Therefore, if we deﬁne

Eq.(17), so that

1/Rs), although the cell are not neutral. To be more ex-
plicit, the cells are neutral if one consideres the nuclei,

but the nuclei charges did not enter our description, and
their contribution to the dielectric function is very small
at optical energies. Therefore, there is no 1/Rs interaction
although only electrons are taken into account.

9 Bloch wave functions

Many works are devoted to the calculation of the optical
response of semiconductors, using a band-structure ap-
proach. To deal with this case, we specify now our results
to the case of one-electron wavefunctions.

The Bloch theorem tells us that one-electron wavefunc-
tions in a crystal can be written exp(ik · r)ul(r; k), where
the index l runs over the bands. When this equation is
introduced into the velocity matrix elements (7), we ﬁnd

We treat now the electric dipole case q = 0. From the
deﬁnition of the two-scale transform of χ and from identity

Therefore, in the electric dipole case, the transitions
are vertical. When spatial dispersion is investigated, then
the transitions are no longer vertical, they explore a part
of the bands around the vertical [58].

We can use the Schr¨odinger equation for ul and ul′ to

show that

In Ref.[5], p.121, Keller has proved that such a relation
between ∇ · V0n(r) and matrix elements of the density
operator holds also valid in the many-body case.

To use the macroscopic constitutive relation (23) we
must deﬁne a separable form (22) for ˜χ in Eq.(37). We
can choose

Because of the presence of the Bloch vector indices k and

be a heavy computation.

All the ingredients are now given for a band-structure
calculation of the macroscopic dielectric constant in the

A similar formula can be obtained for spatial disper-

processes are treated in detail.

10 Many-body dielectric function

Before calculating the dielectric constant corresponding to
a many-body susceptibility, we must show that the trans-
verse part of the microscopic electric ﬁeld varies slowly.
All ﬁelds can be written as the sum of a transverse and
a longitudinal components. The transverse component of
e(q, r) is deﬁned by ∇·eT (r) = 0 and ∇×eT (r) = ∇×e(r).
The corresponding equations for the two-scale transforms
are

iq · eT (q, ρ) + ∇ρ · eT (q, ρ) = 0

(iq + ∇ρ) × eT (q, ρ) = (iq + ∇ρ) × e(q, ρ).

Using the expansion (10) for the full and transverse

electric ﬁelds, we obtain for the a−1 term:

(38)

∇ρ · e(0)
∇ρ × e(0)

T (q, ρ) = 0
T (q, ρ) = ∇ρ × e(0)(q, ρ) = 0,

(39)

12

Christian Brouder, St´ephanie Rossano: Microscopic Calculation of the Constitutive Relations

where the last equality was obtained from the ﬁrst of
Eqs.(11). Equations (39) are the same as the equations
for b(0)(q, ρ) in section 4. Therefore, the conclusion is the
same and e(0)
T (q, ρ) = F(q) does not depend on ρ, it is a
slowly varying function.

To determine F(q) we use the following equation given

by the a0 term

iq · e(0)

T (q, ρ) + a∇ρ · e(1)

T (q, ρ) = 0.

The average of both sides yields q · F(q) = 0 and F(q) is
a macroscopically transverse vector. The other equation
given by the a0 term is

iq × e(0)

T (q, ρ) + ∇ρ × e(1)

T (q, ρ) = iq × e(0)(q, ρ)

+∇ρ × e(1)(q, ρ).

Taking again the average of both sides we obtain q ×
F(q) = q × E(q), so that F(q) = ET (q), and the micro-
scopic transverse electric ﬁeld is equal to the macroscopic
transverse electric ﬁeld.

Notice that this conclusion follows from the Maxwell
equations and does not depend on the constitutive rela-
tions.

In many-body theories, [5,74,75,76,77] the induced
current is related to the external electric ﬁeld or to the
transverse part of the total electric ﬁeld (see Ref.[5] for
a detailed derivation). Since the experimental dielectric
function relates the macroscopic electric displacement to
the macroscopic total electric ﬁeld, we choose the latter
formulation and write

d(r) = ǫ0e(r) +

dr′α(r, r′) · eT (r′).

Z

Repeating all the steps of section 6, we arrive at

d(q, ρ) = ǫ0e(q, ρ) + h˜α(ρ, ρ′; q) · eT (q, ρ′)iρ′ .

Since eT (q, ρ′) = ET (q) does not depend on ρ′, the aver-
age yields simply

D(q) = ǫ0E(q) + h˜α(ρ, ρ′; q)iρρ′ · ET (q).

ET (q) can be expressed in terms of E(q) by

ET (q) = E(q) −

q · E(q)
q2

q

and the ﬁnal formula for the many-body case is D(q) =
ǫ(q) · E(q) with

ǫij (q) = ǫ0δij +

h˜αik(ρ, ρ′; q)iρρ′

Xk

q2δkj − qkqj
q2

.

This formula looks simpler than for the case of the
random phase approximation, but the calculation of the
many-body susceptibility α(r, r′) is much more diﬃcult,
since it must account for all electron-electron interactions,
including the reaction ﬁelds. Notice also that the limit
q → 0 is ambiguous because constant electric ﬁeld cannot
be uniquely decomposed into a transverse and a longitu-
dinal parts.

11 Conclusion

Homogenization theory is usually used to calculate the
properties of “real” materials (porous, ﬁbrous, disordered,
etc.). It is a somewhat just reward that applied physics can
also be useful to basic physics.

Here, homogenization theory was used to calculate the
macroscopic dielectric constant from the microscopic di-
electric function. Compared to previous works, our ap-
proach is not restricted to cubic materials and provides
new equations to describe the local ﬁeld eﬀect in dielectrics.
This article does not exhaust the prospects of homogeniza-
tion theory in solid-state physics. It is rather a detailed
presentation of the simplest possible case and the present
study can be developed in many directions.

A complete derivation of the macroscopic Maxwell equa-

tions should also take magnetism into account. In par-
ticular, the mysterious relation between microscopic and
macroscopic magnetic properties [78] could be handled
with homogenization theory, as well as the question of the
general form of the constitutive relations in bianisotropic
media [59].

Further terms of the expansion can be calculated [44]
to investigate the case when the wavelength of the incident
wave is not very large as compared to the unit cell, as in
the VUV range and for some near-ﬁeld optics or inelastic
scattering experiments.

We have considered an inﬁnite crystal, but homoge-
nization theory can also treat ﬁnite crystals [47,51,52,79].
This is particularly interesting when the medium exhibits
spatial dispersion, i.e. q 6= 0 in Eq.(23), because addi-
tional boundary conditions can be required to determine
the waves inside the dielectric body [37,53,59]. Homog-
enization theory is well suited to describe the boundary
layer that forms at the surface of the dielectric body, and
to derive the corresponding boundary conditions. To do
this, one adds to the bulk (periodic) functions a boundary
function that decreases exponentially out of the dielectric
[41,80]. Besides, the Bloch decomposition of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld seems to be a promissing alternative for
that purpose [46,79,81].

The present work was carried out within the linear
response approximation. Homogenization theory is fully
developed to deal with non-linear equations [22,47,82].

We have considered periodic media, but homogeniza-
tion theory applies also when the periodic structure varies
slowly [20] or in disordered or polycrystalline media [22].
Finally, the method is not restricted to electrodynam-
ics and can be used to calculate any constitutive relation
corresponding to a microscopic non-local equation.

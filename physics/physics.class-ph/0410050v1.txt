Abstract

The limits of the Second Law of thermodynamics, which reigns undisputed in the macroscopic

world, are investigated at the mesoscopic level, corresponding to spatial dimensions of a few mi-

crons. An extremely simple isolated system, modeled after Callen’s adiabatic piston, [1] can be

described as a self-organizing Brownian motor and exhibits a perpetuum mobile behavior, which

may result in a large negative variation of the Clausius entropy.

INTRODUCTION

As ﬁrst clearly stated by Schroedinger “a living organism tends to approach the danger-

ous state of maximum entropy, which is death. It can only keep aloof from it, i.e., alive, by

continually drawing from its environment negative entropy. What an organism fed upon is

negative entropy”.[2] Is it possible for an organism immersed in a thermal bath to be insu-

lated, and thus avoid thermalization, and still be able to reduce its entropy? Unfortunately,

the above scenario contradicts one of the most cherished laws of physics, that is the Second

Law of Thermodynamics, which has victoriously resisted all the attempts aimed at ﬁnding

a particular case where it could be violated. However, one has to consider that the Second

Law has been formulated in the context of macroscopic physics and it is in this context

that it has been successfully applied and veriﬁed. While the Second Law, being inherently

statistical in its nature, cannot carry over to microscopic cases where the number of involved

particles is too small, its limits of validity are not well understood in the region bridging the

macroscopic to the microscopic world.

In particular, some intermediate mesoscopic regime, like, e.g., the biological one associ-

ated with typical cell dimensions (about one micron), is still terra incognita and open to

possible surprises. Recent years have indeed witnessed a growing interest in the thermody-

namics of small-scale non-equilibrium devices, especially in connection with the operation

and the eﬃciency of Brownian motors.[3] These are devices aimed at extracting useful work

out of thermal noise and are the descendents of the famous ratchet mechanism popularized

by Feynman [4] in order to show the impossibility of violating the Second Law of ther-

modynamics. From a quantitative point of view, they are usually described by a state

variable x(t), typically representing a collective degree of freedom of the device, which can

be identiﬁed as the trajectory of a “Brownian particle” of given mass M obeying Newton’s

equation of motion. The forces acting on the “particle” are those resulting from some kind

of prescribed potential V (x), from the viscous-friction term

γ ˙x(t) and from the randomly

−

ﬂuctuating force (Langevin’s force) associated with thermal noise. Even in the presence of

a spatially asymmetric (ratchet-type) potential V (x), no preferential direction of motion is

possible and, consequently, no perpetuum mobile mechanism leading to a violation of the

second law.[4] In this paper, we are going to expand the results obtained in [5] and show

that a very fundamental thermodynamic system, the so-called “adiabatic piston”, ﬁrst intro-

duced by Callen,[1] consisting of an adiabatic cylinder of length L divided into two sections,

containing the same number n of gas moles, by a frictionless impermeable adiabatic wall (see

Fig.1), can be actually modeled as a Brownian motor (although being, conceptually, very

diﬀerent). The state variable of the system is in this case the position x(t) of the moving

wall with respect to its central position L/2, the potential V (x) being not prescribed but

naturally arising, as well as the friction term, as a result of the internal dynamics of the sys-

tem. The evolution of the system from an initial state in which both x(t) and ˙x(t) are zero

exhibits unexpected features: the system fails to settle down to a well-deﬁned equilibrium

state since the piston never comes to a stop but keeps wandering symmetrically around the

initial position, performing oscillations whose mean-square value (evaluated over an ensem-

ble of many replica) is much larger than that pertaining to standard thermal ﬂuctuations.

According to this behavior, the system appears to deserve the name of perpetuum mobile,

even if there is no preferential direction of motion (

= 0). In fact, the variations

∆S of the total entropy S of the system turn out to be negative and, when averaged over

many replica, can give rise to a quite large value of

: since the system is isolated and

the Brownian-particle entropy is negligible (being equal to the Boltzmann constant k), this

constitutes a violation of the Second Law, as typically associated with a perpetuum mobile

behavior. The above results are quite general and basically independent from the speciﬁc

dimensions of the system, no ad hoc parameter having been introduced in the model. How-

ever, the described process turns out to be realistic, as far as the time scales over which it

occurs are concerned, only if the spatial dimensions of the system are strictly limited to a

mesoscopic scale of a few microns; in fact, the time interval tas over which the signiﬁcant

ensemble averages reach their asymptotic value exhibits such a strong dependence on L

valid and the typical cell dimensions is deﬁnitely intriguing.

II. THE DETERMINISTIC ADIABATIC-PISTON

The “adiabatic-piston” has been considered in the frame of standard macroscopic ther-

modynamics as a peculiar example of a system for which the solution to the problem of

predicting the equilibrium state is not entirely determined in the frame of thermostatics.[1]

More precisely, it is impossible to predict the ﬁnal equilibrium state that the system will even-

tually reach starting from an initial one in which the wall is kept ﬁxed and the pressures on
both sides are diﬀerent: given the initial volumes V (i)

the dot stands for derivation with respect to time. They have been derived by assuming

that thermal equilibrium is reached on a time scale much shorter than the ones pertaining

to TA(t),TB(t), a condition which is usually well satisﬁed in the macroscopic regime. Their

solution provides the answer to the adiabatic piston problem. In particular, Eq.(1), is easily

recovered by setting all the time derivative in Eqs.(2)-(4) equal to zero. Thus, the system

will eventually settle on the equal-pressure line deﬁned by Eq.(1) (see Fig.2), on a speciﬁc

position entirely determined by the initial conditions.

According to macroscopic thermodynamics, where ﬂuctuations are ignored, this is the

end of the story: the piston will settle on a speciﬁc position on the equal-pressure line and

remain there for ever. Actually, the validity of our kinetic model is not restricted to the

thermodynamic realm but goes beyond it to describe a mesoscopic regime where ﬂuctuations

cannot be neglected. As a matter of fact, once the system settles on the equal-pressure line,

the main restoring force associated with the ﬁnite pressure diﬀerence in section A and B (ﬁrst

term of the RHS of Eq.(4)) vanishes and the behavior of the piston along the equal-pressure

line (see Fig.2) is dictated by the presence of ﬂuctuations associated with the random hits

suﬀered by the piston because of collisions with the gas molecules. After taking advantage

of Eq. (1), Eq.(4) can be rewritten as

the correct expression for a(t) is a delicate task since the standard Langevin approach

does not in general carry over to nonlinear dynamical systems [7], as the one described by

Eq.(6). In order to take advantage of the Langevin method, we linearize the above equation:

According to the above results, the collective degree of freedom x(t), describing the evo-

lution of the state of our system, obeys an equation formally similar to that of a “Brownian

particle” in one dimension. However, the potential term and the viscous drag have naturally

emerged out of the internal dynamics of the system and do not correspond to an external

active force or to a phenomenological friction term as in the case of Brownian motors. If we

where a(t) is the Langevin acceleration, a case which has been thoroughly investigated in the

literature [10]. Equation (7), together with Eq.(8), describes the “overdamped” case of the

Brownian motion of a harmonically-bound particle (in fact, β/ω =

16/π√N >> 1, since

N is typically a large number). The general analysis carried out in [10] shows, in particular,

In other words, our analysis shows that our closed system never reaches a ﬁnal equilibrium

state, thus contradicting the usual statement that any closed system in an equilibrium state,

once an internal constraint is removed, eventually reaches a new equilibrium state.

IV. VARIATION OF THE ENTROPY

The peculiar behavior of the adiabatic-piston system discussed above has a natural coun-

terpart in its entropy variations. To see this, we observe that in each realization the entropy

variation from the initial state in which both sections have the same volume V0/2 and tem-

perature T0 to a generic one (VA, TA; VB, TB) is given, according to the standard Clausius

deﬁnition and recalling that the piston moves on an equal pressure line, by

In deriving Eq.(17), we have exploited the relation TA + TB = 2T0, which corresponds to

neglect the kinetic energy of the wall: in fact, by the term “adiabatic” we actually mean that

the piston can be regarded as a body possessing a single (translational) degree of freedom,

so that its energy and entropy, respectively of the order kT0/2 and k, can be neglected. The

ensemble average of ∆S over many realizations of the system starting from the initial state

corresponding to X(t = 0) = L/2, which can be easily checked to be a negative quantity,

This corresponds, whenever µ√N >> 1, to a large negative entropy decrease, and consti-

tutes a violation of the Second Law, consistent with the perpetuum mobile behavior of the

system.

If embedded in a thermal bath at temperature T0 and pressure P0, it is indeed

possible to devise a process by means of which work can be extracted from the environment

(see Appendix).

A fundamental issue is on which spatial and temporal scales the above results will rea-

sonably apply.

In order to explore it, we refer to the speciﬁc case of a gas under stan-

dard conditions of temperature and pressure for which, expressing hereafter L in microns,

This extremely sensitive fourth-power dependence of tas on the linear dimension of our sys-

tem limits the applicability of our model to values of L up to a few microns. In fact, beyond

this mesoscopic scale, tas becomes so large as to render invalid the underlying assumption

that the piston remains perfectly adiabatic over this time interval. As an example, for

µ = 0.01 and L = 1cm, one gets tas = 5

1012sec, that is about 1000 centuries! Conversely,

by taking L = 1µm, we get for tas a reasonable value of 5

has emerged spontaneously from the adiabatic-piston problem, without the introduction of

any ad hoc parameter. The Second Law, stating that the entropy of an isolated system

cannot decrease, is actually violated in the speciﬁc example provided above. The associ-

ated spatial scale appears thus to set a borderline between the macroscopic realm and the

mesoscopic one.

adopting a second-order leap-frog algorithm as the one developed in [13]. In particular, we

are able to evaluate the ensemble average (over 1000 realizations of the piston) of the time

evolution of the mean square-root deviation

VI. THE THERMODYNAMIC LIMIT

The above investigation of a very elementary and yet rather intriguing problem, i.e., the

adiabatic-piston problem, has shown how, under particular initial conditions, the system

never sets to a ﬁnal equilibrium position but keeps performing ample oscillations around its

initial state without ever coming to a halt. An immediate consequence of this peculiar be-

havior is the violation of the Second Law of thermodynamics, in the sense that the ensemble

average of the entropy variations over many identical replica of the isolated system turns

out to be negative and large compared with standard thermal entropy ﬂuctuations. How-

ever, the possibility for this occurrence to be realistic limits the dimensions of the system to

very speciﬁc mesoscopic spatial scales, of the order of one micron, so that no implications

whatsoever can be drawn on the validity of the Second Law in the realm of standard thermo-

dynamics, which applies to the macroscopic world. In fact, if one studies the same problem

in the thermodynamic limit where the number of particles N and the mass of the piston

goes to inﬁnity, while σ/M and µ = Mg/M are ﬁxed, the behavior of the piston becomes

less bizarre and basically obeys the laws of thermodynamics. More precisely, it is possible

to show, by means of numerical simulations, that, in this limit, the evolution of the piston

is predictable and that eventually a ﬁnal equilibrium state is reached. This happens in two

stages: the ﬁrst one, deterministic, (basically equivalent to our kinetic model [5] described

in Sect. 2 of this paper) leads the system on the equal-pressure line and is characterized

by a short time-scale τ1 ∼= (L/w)√µ; the second one, stochastic, dominated by pressure
ﬂuctuations (described in Sect.3) is associated with a much longer time-scale τ2 ∼= µNτ1
(= tasµ) and eventually brings the system to a ﬁnal state of both mechanical and thermal

equilibrium.

[14] After this, the piston starts oscillations which then deﬁnitely disappear

in time [14, 15]. In view of the above, our violation of the Second Law does not appear

that surprising since it concerns a regime outside the thermodynamic limit and, besides, has

been obtained by adopting the Clausius deﬁnition of entropy introduced at the macroscopic

level. However, it can be interpreted as the signature of something remarkable happening

at the borderline between the macroscopic and mesoscopic realms, signaling that a new way

of looking at standard thermodynamic concepts is needed if we wish to continue to apply

them outside the realm in which they were ﬁrst introduced.

VII. CONCLUSIONS

We have been able to show, relying on a simple kinetic analytic description, that the

approach to equilibrium of the so-called adiabatic piston reveals, for very speciﬁc spatial di-

mensions of the system (around 1µm), a peculiar behavior which presents the characteristics

of a perpetuum mobile leading, in turn, to a violation of the Second Law.

The same problem of time evolution and approach to equilibrium of the system has been

also considered by using molecular dynamics simulations. [16, 17, 18] These typically involve

a considerable number of point particles (around 500) which model the gas inside the cylinder

and are separated by a frictionless movable piston, without internal degrees of freedom,

against which they undergo perfectly elastic collisions. Some general features emerge from

the numerical analysis, which reveal, consistently with our results, a very slow approach to

the ﬁnal equilibrium state. In particular, the diﬀerence between the temperatures on the

two sides keeps oscillating around zero without reaching thermodynamic equilibrium [17].

Remarkably, the thermal relaxation time τth from quasi-equilibrium to global equilibrium

(equal temperature and pressure on both sides), numerically evaluated in [18], is extremely

well represented by our expression of tas (see Eq. 14).

In fact, by taking, as in [18],

L = 30 and w = 1 (in suitably normalized units) our expression of tas reads, (see Eq. (14)),
tas ∼= 30

In conclusion, we believe to have identiﬁed a very speciﬁc spatial regime, at the border

of standard thermodynamics, where a particular system, Callen’s adiabatic-piston, can be

described by a kinetic approach. In its frame, very peculiar features emerge which seem to

challenge the limits of validity of the Second Law. Whether this is really the case, or one is

entering a realm where some concepts of standard thermodynamic are no longer applicable,

seems to be a legitimate question whose answer may shed some light on the understanding

of small-scale nonequilibrium devices.

We wish to thank Noel Corngold for many interesting discussions.

Appendix

If our system is embedded in a thermal bath at temperature T0 and pressure P0, the

following process, sketched in Fig. 7, can be used for extracting work from the environment.

In the ﬁrst panel, the system is in the initial state. The second panel shows the system after

a large entropy variation ∆S has occurred. At this point, we separate the two sections (panel

3) and drive the two gases back to the initial temperature T0 by means of two reversible
adiabatic processes, the relation between the new volumes V ′

2 and the previous

1 and V ′

volumes V1 ,V2 and temperatures T1,T2 being

This is followed (panel 4) by two reversible isothermal processes in which the two sections

are in contact with the thermal bath at temperature T0, which take the two sections back

to the initial temperature T0 and volume V0/2 (frame 5). The total work extracted in the

process is

W = W1 + W2 = nRT0 ln(

) + nRT0 ln(

) = nRT0 ln[

Since V1 + V2 = 2V0 and T1 + T2 = 2T0, we obviously have T 2

0 > T1T2 and V 2

0 > V1V2, so that

a work W larger than zero has been obtained at the expenses of the heat Q = W extracted

by a single source (the thermal bath). It can be easily checked that W = T0∆S ∼= kT0Nµ,
that is each gas molecule contributes with a fraction µkT0/2 to the work performed.

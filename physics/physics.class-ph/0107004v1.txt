Abstract. The regular-geometric-ﬁgure solution to the N -body problem is presented
in a very simple way. The Newtonian formalism is used without resorting to a more
involved rotating coordinate system. Those conﬁgurations occur for other kinds of
interactions beyond the gravitacional ones for some special values of the parameters
of the forces. For the harmonic oscillator, in particular, it is shown that the N -body
problem is reduced to N one-body problems.

...solution to the N-body problem

2

Despite the eﬀorts of mathematicians and physicists over more than two centuries
of research the general problem of N mutually interacting bodies moving according to
Newton’s laws, for N > 2, has never been solved exactly. The two-body problem subject
to forces which depend on the relative vector positions can be reduced to two one-body
problems, one of which describes the motion of the center of mass and the other one
the relative motion. N = 3 is the smallest value of N that turns the N-body problem
unsolvable in the general case. However, under special assumptions about the type of
motion and interaction, analytical solutions of the N-body problem can be found.

In the case of the three-body problem with gravitational interactions some special
solutions are usually presented in the textbooks on classical mechanics. In the so-called
restricted three-body problem two heavy bodies move about the common center of mass
whereas a third light body moves in the same plane [1]-[3]. In the so-called Lagrange’s
case the three bodies are at the vertices of an equilateral triangle in every part of the
motion, which rotates about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the bodies while it
changes in size [4]-[7]. There is still another special solution for three bodies interacting
by gravitational forces known as Euler’s case. In that last case the bodies move along
the same straight line during all the motion [8]-[10]. Another special solution is that of
N bodies of similar masses subject to similar forces moving on the vertices of a regular
N-sided polygon [11]. All of these special solutions are of great pedagogical importance
since they give solutions of a problem unsolvable in the general case. Nevertheless the
resolution of Lagrange’s case, as presented by textbook authors, resorts to a rotating
coordinate system requiring an extensive calculation, and consequently to a weakening
of the pedagogical attractiveness.

In a previous work [12] Lagrange’s case has been presented in an alternative and
more general way, permitting that it can be easily approached immediately after the
presentation of the two-body problem. In that paper the equilateral-triangle solutions
were obtained for interactions which go beyond the gravitational ones. Ess´en, in a
[12]), approached this
recent paper to this journal [13] (homonym to that one in Ref.
very same problem using the Lagrangian formalism restricting himself to gravitational
interactions and presenting an extension to the N-body problem. Encouraged by the
results obtained in [13] and following the same steps of Ref. [12], in this paper we reduce
the N-body problem to N one-body problems in the case of more general central two-
body interactions, such that the total force on each body is directed towards, or from
the center of mass of the N-body system. As a by-product, for gravitational interactions
we obtain an extension of the Lagrange case. We obtain that the N bodies are on the
vertices of a non-rigid (in general) regular geometric ﬁgure throughout the motion. For
other kind of interactions, this is also possible if certain conditions are satisﬁed by the
parameters characterizing the intensities of the forces.

Let us consider N bodies (treated as particles) with masses mi (i = 1, . . . N) located
by the vectors ri. It is supposed that the forces are pairwise, directly proportional to
an arbitrary exponent of the distance between the bodies and directed along the line
connecting them. Thus the resulting force acting on the i -th body due to the other

...solution to the N-body problem

N − 1 bodies can be written as

Fi = −

Xj=1
(j6=i)

ri − rj
rn
ij

where Kij (Kii = 0 and Kij = Kji, according to Newton’s third law) is the
proportionality constant, rij is the distance between the bodies i and j, and the exponent
n is a real number. Included within the possibilities allowed by (1) are some familiar
forms of interactions such as the gravitational and the harmonic oscillation ones. For
the gravitational case we have n = 3 and Kij = Gmimj, where G is the universal
gravitation constant, whereas for a harmonic-oscillator-type interaction n = 0.

The N-body problem is not subject to external forces and consequently the center
of mass of the system has no acceleration and, for the sake of simplicity, it is considered
as being in rest. The position of the i -th body from the center of mass of the system r′
i
is related to ri by

ri = r′

i + R

where R is the vector position of the center of mass. Therefore in the center-of-mass
system frame the force acting on the i -th body takes the form

is the eﬀective proportionality constant and m =
Therefore the N-body problem reduces to N coupled problems of bodies exposed to
central forces, with the common center of force located in the center of mass of the
system. The coupling occurs by the presence of rij in (10).

As a particular case one has the gravitational one, for the three-body problem
with the three bodies moving on the vertices of an equilateral triangle and in addition
for four bodies on the vertices of a regular tetrahedron (rij = rik, for all i, j and k
with i 6= j and i 6= k). One should also note that there is no reason for maintaining
rij = const, i.e., a rigid regular geometric ﬁgure, it is just enough that any side or edge
be congruent to any other during all the time in order to maintain the regular character
of the geometric ﬁgure. Thus, it means that λ may vary with time. In other words,
the regular geometric ﬁgures may change in size with their sides or edges expanding or
contracting at the same rhythm, as in the original Lagrange’s case (three gravitating
bodies, r3
ij = G/λ), and in the case of the tetrahedron as well. As a matter of fact the
equilateral-triangle ﬁgure may also remain rigid while the bodies rotate about an axis
perpendicular to the plane with a common angular velocity, and in this situation the
bodies move on circles centered at the center of mass of the system, which coincides with
the common center of force. For a regular-tetrahedral ﬁgure things are indeed diﬀerent
because one should have four bodies on the vertices of a rigid tetrahedron moving on
the great circles of concentric spheres, and this is impossible even in the case of equal
masses when one should have just one sphere.

The equilateral-triangle and the regular-tetrahedral solutions also occur in a more

general situation where

an n-independent condition, equivalent to Kij = αimj, where αi is a constant.

It is worthwhile to note that the constraint (12) implies that the N-body problem
reduces to N one-body problems only in the case of the harmonic-oscillator-type
interactions (n = 0), here the geometric links are missing in (8) and (10) thus each of
the N bodies moves independently of the others as if they were bounded to the center
of mass of the N-body system by springs of elastic constants given by K eff
ij = αim, so
they do not need to be on the vertices of a regular geometric ﬁgure. The condition (12)
has the same form as that one found in Ref. [14] showing the necessary condition for the
Jacobi coordinates ρ = r2 − r1 and λ = r3 − m1r1+m2r2
be conducive to the separation
of the variables in the three-body problem with harmonic interactions.

m1+m2

It is worth pointing out that other solutions to the N-body problem with central
forces can be obtained if the condition (8) is not imposed for all i, j and k but only
for j and k which label the nearest particles of i -th one. This last condition is less
restrictive than that one presented in Ref. [7] which requires N bodies of similar masses
subject to similar forces moving on the vertices of a regular N-sided polygon. Taking
into account that weaker condition one is conduced to all sorts of regular geometric
ﬁgures. Regular polygons can rotate about an axis perpendicular to the plane with a
common angular velocity while they change their sides at the same pace. For regular
polyhedrons, though, expansions or contractions are the only permitted movements.

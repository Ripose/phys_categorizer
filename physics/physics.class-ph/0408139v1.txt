ABSTRACT

We show that there exists a choice of gauge in which the electromagnetic 4-
potential may be written as the diﬀerence of two 4-velocity vector ﬁelds satisfying
a speciﬁc third order partial diﬀerential equation. The standard electromagnetic
quantities then admit new interpretations as functions of the local 4-velocities.
If the vector ﬁelds are associated with the motion of an underlying relativis-
tic continuum, then electromagnetic waves are described by oscillations of that
medium. The formulation in terms of 4-velocities is more general than that of
the standard 4-potential in that it also allows for a classical description of a large
class of vacuum energy conﬁgurations.

1. Introduction

Motivated by the fact that macroscopic waves tend to propagate in a medium
of some kind, many physicists have in the past attempted to ﬁnd a description of
electrodynamics in which electromagnetic waves may also be described by the motion
of an underlying medium, commonly referred to as the ‘aether’1. Despite signiﬁcant
eﬀorts, no such description was found, and the negative results of the Michelson-
Morley experiment2 put the ﬁnal nail in the coﬃn of the aether concept as it was
then understood. The failure of this program eventually led to the introduction of the
concept of a ‘ﬁeld’3,4 requiring no underlying medium, and on quantisation of these
ﬁelds, to ‘quantum ﬁeld theory’.

We will demonstrate here that Maxwell’s equations can in fact be derived from
the motion of an underlying medium if we assume that the underlying spacetime is
Lorentzian rather than Galilean. While our formulation is not identical to, or even
necessarily as intuitive as the aether concept, it does show that an alternative descrip-
tion of electrodynamics did (and does) exist which did not require the introduction of
the ﬁeld concept. The medium can be interpreted as a relativistic continuum with two
(basically identical) components whose motion satisﬁes a speciﬁc third order partial

diﬀerential equation corresponding to the Lorentz force equation.

We will proceed as follows. In

2, we ﬁrst establish a choice of reference frame and
§
the coordinates that we will use to describe the motion of the continuum. We then de-
ﬁne the ‘continuum gauge’, and show how the standard equations of electrodynamics
appear if the 4-velocity of the continuum is associated with the speciﬁed components
of the electromagnetic 4-potential in this gauge. The Lorentz force equation is found
to translate into a third order partial diﬀerential equation which must be satisﬁed by
the motion of the continuum.

In

3, we demonstrate the consistency of the continuum gauge by explicitly de-
§
riving the conﬁgurations associated with the inﬁnitesimal point charge and the plane
electromagnetic wave. We also state the relativistic counterpart of the principle of
superposition and show that our formalism has suﬃcient freedom to allow for the
description of a large class of vacuum conﬁgurations which cannot be accounted for
in the standard 4-potential description. We are led to associate a mass density with
the continuum and brieﬂy explore its consequences.

We end in
with signature (+,

2. The Relativistic Continuum

In this section we establish the reference system and the coordinates that we will
use to describe the motion of the continuum, and deﬁne the ‘continuum gauge’, show-
ing how the standard electrodynamic equations appear. In particular we show that
the Lorentz force equation translates into a third order partial diﬀerential equation
constraining the continuum’s motion.

Suppose there exists a continuum in relative motion to this frame which spans

continuum’ respectively.

Let τ be the proper time in the inertial frame, and let r denote the 3-position
(x, y, z) of a point in the continuum. Considering the instantaneous motion at proper
time τ of the continuum at a point r, the 3-velocity of either component of the
continuum at that point as measured by the inertial frame is,

v =

where t is the time as measured by a clock moving with the continuum. We can

tinua independently, and henceforth we will distinguish the two sets of variables by
a ‘+’ or ‘-’ subscript respectively as necessary.

Other standard properties now follow in the usual way. From the deﬁnition (8),

F µν satisﬁes the Jacobi identity,

and this is just the covariant form of the homogeneous Maxwell’s equations. One can

ﬁeld which describes the mass density distribution for the charge. The Lorentz force
equation cannot be derived directly from the deﬁnition of the 4-potential, and must
be imposed as an auxiliary constraint.

(11)

The charge 4-velocity and scalar charge density are related to the 4-current density

J µ through the following equation,

where, being a 4-velocity, W µ is constrained by,

This constraint allows us to separate the 4-current uniquely into the charge density

ﬂipped by a Lorentz transformation, each 4-velocity vector ﬁeld can only account for
either positive or negative charge conﬁgurations, and hence the need for two separate
4-velocity vector ﬁelds. The form of the charge 4-velocity in terms of the continuum
4-velocity then follows directly from (12).

Besides the mass M which is determined by initial conditions, each of the terms
in (11) may be written in terms of the 4-velocities uµ
−. From the deﬁnitions
of F µν, J µ, Q and W µ, we ﬁnd that the Lorentz force equation (11) translates into
a complicated third order partial diﬀerential equation constraining the 4-velocities.
The conservation of mass follows from the continuity equation for mass density,

+ and uµ

(MW µ),µ = 0 ,

(16)

which is ensured if the ﬂow of mass density follows the ﬂow of charge density.
It
remains for us to ﬁnd an underlying equation of motion for the continuum such that
these constraints are satisﬁed, and we will return to this in
3 after having derived
§
the velocity distribution of the continuum outside of a point charge.

3. The Consistency of the Continuum Gauge

In

+ and uµ

+ and Aµ

2.2 we identiﬁed the components Aµ
− of the 4-potential with the 4-
§
velocities uµ
− of the continuum, satisfying the conditions (6) and (7). We
referred to this gauge choice as the ‘continuum gauge’. It is not obvious that this
gauge choice can be applied consistently to all electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations, so
we demonstrate its consistency here, with explicit details given for the inﬁnitesimal
point charge and the plane electromagnetic wave.

To proceed, we recall from the principle of superposition that any electromagnetic
ﬁeld conﬁguration can be separated into two components, one generated solely by the
motion of positive charges, and another generated by the motion of negative charges.
We will show below that, irrespective of the speciﬁc conﬁguration, the ‘positive’
component can be described by some 4-potential Aµ
+ in the continuum gauge, which
is derived from the motion of the positive continuum. An identical argument shows
that the analogous result is also true for the ‘negative’ component, and together this
suﬃces to prove consistency of the gauge choice.

There is actually a signiﬁcant element of freedom inherent in the way this separa-
tion is made, in that it is always possible to add an arbitrary distribution of positive
charges with arbitrary motion together with the same distribution of negative charges
with an identical motion - the net eﬀect of the two contributions will be to cancel
each other. This freedom may have physical signiﬁcance and we will come back to

this point later.

3.1. The Inﬁnitesimal Point Charge

The basic case which we must be able to account for is that of a static inﬁnites-
imal point-like positive charge element, as this can act as a generator of all other
electromagnetic conﬁgurations based upon the motion of positive charges, through
application of appropriate relativistic transformations (such as Poincar´e transforma-
tions and relativistic accelerations) and the principle of superposition.

So let us consider an inﬁnitesimal positive charge element q = limr→0 ρδV (where
3πr3) placed at the origin. The corresponding electromagnetic ﬁelds are given

δV = 4
by,

We seek a potential 4-vector which accounts for this ﬁeld conﬁguration of the form,

where the positive square root must be taken. This can be checked by considering a
small Lorentz boost of the charge/continuum along the x-axis, say, and insisting that
the resulting B-ﬁeld around the moving charge have the correct direction as observed
in nature. This implies that the continuum ﬂows away from the chargea, and moreover
that the charge acts as a source for the continuum. The solution for the velocity ﬁeld

The above proves that the electromagnetic ﬁelds outside a positive point charge

Note that if a potential 4-vector ﬁeld Aµ

scribes some initial ﬁeld conﬁguration, then any other ﬁeld conﬁguration which can be

obtained from the original by a relativistic transformation (such as Poincar´e transfor-
mations or relativistic accelerations) is described by the relativistically-transformed
4-potential, which will of course remain in the continuum gauge.

By an identical argument to the above we can also show that any ﬁeld conﬁgura-
tion described by the motion of negative charges is described by a unique 4-potential
Aµ
− in the continuum gauge. Because any ﬁeld conﬁguration can be separated into a
sum of positive and negative charge contributions (albeit not uniquely), this completes
our demonstration of consistency for the continuum gauge.

3.2. The Plane Electromagnetic Wave

While it is easy enough to claim that all electromagnetic conﬁgurations can ulti-
mately be described by the motion of charges, there do exist nontrivial conﬁgurations
in which no charges are present, the most obvious and important example being that
of the electromagnetic wave. It is therefore important, both for this reason and from a
historical perspective, to show explicitly how plane waves arise in the present context
from the motion of the relativistic continuum. We turn to this problem now.

Let us consider a plane electromagnetic wave with wave-vector k travelling in
the x-direction with the E-ﬁeld plane-polarised in the y-direction. The 4-potential
describing this plane wave is,

(where ω = ck), with corresponding E and B ﬁelds,

Aµ = (0, A) = (0, 0, Ay cos(ωt

kx), 0) ,

−

E = (0, Ey, 0) = (0, kAy sin(ωt

−
B = (0, 0, Bz) = (0, 0, kAy sin(ωt

kx)) .

−

We therefore seek solutions of the form,

Aµ

+ = (cγ+, γ+v+) , Aµ

− = (

cγ−,

γ−v−) .

−

Applying (5) and equating with (29) we obtain the two conditions,

γ+ = γ− ,

γ+v+

γ−v− = (0, Ay cos(ωt

kx), 0) .

−

−

Ignoring for the time being equal velocity motions of both positive and nega-
tive continua (these do not aﬀect the 4-potential and will be discussed in the next
subsection), these two conditions together imply that,

−

(36)

and we have deﬁned A = Ay cos(ωt

Equation (35) shows that the velocities of the positive continuum and the negative
continuum are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so that there is no net
π/2 radians
charge, with the motion of both being parallel to the electric ﬁeld but
out of phase respectively.
It follows from (36) that the velocity of the continuum
can never exceed the speed of light, irrespective of the intensity of the plane wave.
Substituting (36) into (32) the motion of the continuum is given by,

∓

uµ

c2 + A2/4, 0, A/2, 0) ,

uµ
− = (

c2 + A2/4, 0,

A/2, 0) .

These equations clearly show that the propagation of a plane electromagnetic
wave is described by the oscillation of the medium in the direction of the electric
ﬁeld - the positive continuum oscillates π/2 out of phase with E while the negative
continuum oscillates with the same magnitude and precisely the opposite phase. Thus
the propagation of electromagnetic waves is seen to be a direct manifestation of the
oscillations of the underlying relativistic continuum.

3.3. The Principle of Superposition

The principle of superposition still holds, albeit in a new relativistic form. Con-
′µ
+ = (cγ′, γ′v′) in the contin-
sider two potential 4-vector ﬁelds Aµ
uum gauge which describe two diﬀerent ﬁeld conﬁgurations. Then the superposition
′′µ
+ = (cγ′′, γ′′v′′) where
of the two ﬁeld conﬁgurations is described by the 4-potential A
the velocity vector ﬁeld v′′ is given by the pointwise relativistic sum of v and v′,

+ = (cγ, γv) and A

v′′ =

v + v′

1 + v

v′/c2 .

(38)

·
By judicious application of relativistic transformations and the principle of super-
position to the solution for an inﬁnitesimal charge element, we can in principle model
any electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration described by the motion of positive charges
by a unique 4-potential Aµ
+ in the continuum gauge, with the obvious extension to
the general case involving also Aµ
−.

As mentioned brieﬂy earlier, the decomposition in terms of 4-velocities uµ

+ and
uµ
− is not unique because of the possibility of (relativistically) adding the same ar-
bitrary time-dependent 4-velocity vector ﬁeld to both Aµ
− without changing
the resulting 4-potential. This additional freedom corresponds to a large class of vac-
uum conﬁgurations which can perhaps be interpreted in terms of the motion of an
arbitrarily distributed ‘Dirac sea’ of particles and antiparticles whose electromagnetic

+ and Aµ

eﬀects precisely cancel each other. This would appear to provide a means of adding
energy density to the vacuum without any observable electromagnetic eﬀects.

−

+ and Aµ

If on the other hand, one would like to remove this freedom one can choose to
constrain Aµ
− in such a way that the sum of the magnitudes of the scalar
potentials φ+
φ− is minimised point by point leaving no redundant charges con-
tributing to the Dirac sea. If this constraint is applied there remains only one solution
for the inﬁnitesimal charge element (in fact the one which we have derived), and the
number of solutions cannot be increased either by relativistic transformations or by
superposition. Moreover the decomposition of any electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration
into positive and negative contributions becomes unique so that there is no remaining
redundancy to be accounted for in this gauge.

3.4. The Massive Continuum

We saw in (28) that the velocity of the continuum decreases with radius outside of
the point charge acting as its source. Had the continuum been massless, its velocity
would have been constant and equal to c everywhere. We therefore conclude that
the continuum has mass and that there is an attractive central force acting on the
continuum outside of the charge.

Ignoring eﬀects due to gravitational curvature it is possible to derive an expression
fo this attractive central force.
In particular, if we assume the charged particle is
centred at the origin, then the force f i acting on an inﬁnitesimal element of the
continuum at radius r must satisfy6,

f i =

where m = ρmδV is the mass of the test element assuming that it has mass density
ρm and occupies volume δV . To ﬁnd the value of dv/dt, let us ﬁrst rewrite (28) as
follows (recall that α = q/4πǫ0),

−
Diﬀerentiating this equation with respect to t gives us an expression for dv/dt in
terms of v. Rearranging terms and simplifying, we ﬁnd that the ﬁeld at radius r is
attractive and is given by a simple inverse square law,

−
The appearance of this Coulomb-like interaction between the charged particle
and the continuum it emits is encouraging given that it is a standard result that the
Lorentz force equation follows from Coulomb’s law if special relativity is assumed to
hold7. The presence of Coulomb interactions between point particles would suﬃce to

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

explain why the motion of the continuum satisﬁes the third order partial diﬀerential
equation corresponding to the Lorentz force law.

Assuming mass conservation, the mass density distribution of the continuum will

satisfy the following continuity equation,

∂µ(ρmvµ) =

∂(ρmγ)

(ρmγv) = 0 .

∂t − ∇ ·
We can ignore the time-derivative term as the system is assumed to be in a
steady state condition, and can rewrite the divergence term in its spherical polar form
since the velocity depends only on the radius. Substituting from (28) the continuity
equation simpliﬁes to,

which has solution,

(r2ρmγv) = 0 ,

where k is a radius-independent proportionality factor. A deeper analysis of the im-
plications of a massive continuum will require a general relativistic approach bearing
in mind that the equations of electrodynamics will be modiﬁed in the presence of a
gravitational ﬁeld. We hope to explore the cosmological implications in more detail
in a future work.

4. Discussion and Summary

In this paper we have demonstrated the simple yet profound result that all of the
equations of classical electrodynamics follow from the motion of a two-component
relativistic continuum satisfying a certain third order partial diﬀerential equation.

Maxwell and others had struggled to ﬁnd a mathematical description of the un-
derlying medium, the ‘aether’, in which electromagnetic waves were presumed to
propagate. Although the continuum we have described is not precisely equivalent
to the notion which the earlier proponents had had in mind, our analysis does show
that a description of electrodynamics in terms of an underlying continuum is possible.
This is particularly important as the failure to ﬁnd such a formulation historically
contributed to the origin of the concept of ‘ﬁelds’ postulated not to require such a
medium. The ﬁeld concept may not have been necessary after all.

The main conclusion to be drawn is as follows: If the relativistic continuum de-
scribed does in fact exist, then the only physically real objects are the continuum itself,
its motion, and presumably its density. In such a framework, all of the standard elec-
trodynamic quantities have interpretations in terms of the continuum’s motion and
each object can be written as an explicit function of the 4-velocity of the continuum.

In this picture, charged particles (whose charge can, as it happens, here be mea-
sured in units of time) appear as sources of the continuum, while electromagnetic
waves are associated with oscillations of the continuum, thus potentially solving this
age-old mystery. Furthermore, there is a freedom inherent in the 4-velocity description
of electrodynamics which means that it is possible to account classically for a large
class of additional vacuum conﬁgurations, which includes in particular the potential
to describe any arbitrary distribution of vacuum energy density or ‘dark matter’.

In summary, we have put forward a promising and potentially far-reaching al-
ternative to the established way of thinking about electrodynamics which sheds new
light on our interpretation of the standard electrodynamic quantities. While the stan-
dard formulation in terms of the four-potential has an associated gauge invariance,
which is the main unifying theme between electrodynamics and the other forces of
the standard model, the new formulation promises to establish a strong link with cos-
mology and the large scale structure of spacetime. Perhaps both formulations should
go hand in hand, and it will be interesting to see what new ideas spring forth from
this alternative description.

While a number of important questions appear to have been addressed here, we
are still left to ponder the underlying interpretation of point particles and the origin
of their observed masses and quantised charges.
It will also be interesting to see
whether realistic cosmological models can eventually be developed in this framework.

Failure of geometric electromagnetism in the adiabatic vector Kepler problem

The magnetic moment of a particle orbiting a straight current-carrying wire may precess rapidly
enough in the wire’s magnetic ﬁeld to justify an adiabatic approximation, eliminating the rapid
time dependence of the magnetic moment and leaving only the particle position as a slow degree
of freedom. To zeroth order in the adiabatic expansion, the orbits of the particle in the plane
perpendicular to the wire are Keplerian ellipses. Higher order post-adiabatic corrections make the
orbits precess, but recent analysis of this ‘vector Kepler problem’ has shown that the eﬀective
Hamiltonian incorporating a post-adiabatic scalar potential (‘geometric electromagnetism’) fails to
predict the precession correctly, while a heuristic alternative succeeds. In this paper we resolve the
apparent failure of the post-adiabatic approximation, by pointing out that the correct second-order
analysis produces a third Hamiltonian, in which geometric electromagnetism is supplemented by a
tensor potential. The heuristic Hamiltonian of Schmiedmayer and Scrinzi is then shown to be a
canonical transformation of the correct adiabatic Hamiltonian, to second order. The transformation
has the important advantage of removing a 1/r3 singularity which is an artifact of the adiabatic
approximation.

An analogue to the Kepler problem of motion in an
inverse square force can be realized with magnetism and
adiabaticity – except that the analogue to the planetary
mass is not a scalar, but a vector component [1]. For a
particle of mass M with spin ~s and gyromagnetic ratio
µ, moving in a magnetic ﬁeld ~B(~x), the Hamiltonian is

If the ﬁeld ~B =

of linear momentum is conserved, and so the problem
reduces to ﬁnding the orbit of the particle in the xy plane.
The magnitude s of ~s is ﬁxed, and the z component of

ε = s/Jz is small. This implies a separation of time
scales, so that adiabatic methods may be applied [2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

To zeroth order in ε one can (as we will review below)

replace H with the eﬀective Hamiltonian

where we drop the z direction, rescale to dimensionless
units, and use standard polar co-ordinates r, θ, centred
on the current-carrying wire.
In HAD0 the pairs r, pr
and θ, pθ are canonically conjugate, and σ is simply a
constant. We can recognize HAD0 as the Hamiltonian
for Kepler’s problem of motion under an inverse square
force. See Figure 1. In this vector version of the prob-
lem, however, the analogue of the particle mass, σ
sθ,
is a vector component. It may therefore be positive or
negative; but since the problems considered in this paper

FIG. 1: Orbits of the magnetic particle about the current-
carrying wire at the origin, from numerical solution of the
equations of motion (10)-(11) derived from (1). Initial con-
ditions are σ(0) = 0.9, α(0) = 0, r(0) = 10, pr(0) = 0, and
ε = s/Jz = 0.2. The slightly polygonal appearance of the
trajectory, with rounded corners between straighter sections,
is not a numerical artifact:
it is the rapid component of the
particle motion.

As Figure 1 illustrates, for small ε the particle orbits
are indeed well described as ellipses. Two kinds of correc-
tions, however, are also evident: a rapid wobble, which is
straightforward to compute, and a slow precession, which
is not. Capturing eﬀects like this slow precession is the
goal of higher order adiabatic approximations, which add
to HAD0 terms of higher order in ε. Classic papers on
adiabatic methods [3, 4, 5, 6, 8] prescribe for this problem

HGEM is actually worse than HAD0, in that it yields
precession in the wrong direction; whereas the precession

In this paper we explain that nothing has gone wrong
with adiabatic theory. The problem is simply that a
tensor potential, formally identiﬁed by Littlejohn and
Weigert [7], and proportional in our case to r−3, must

be included in addition to the more widely known vec-
tor and scalar potentials of geometric electromagnetism.
In the next four Sections (II-V) we build up to a simple
derivation of this term, ﬁrst reviewing the zeroth order
approximation, and then geometric electromagnetism. In
Section IV we discuss the subtlety of relating the ini-
tial conditions for the exact and approximate evolutions.
Then in Section V we present the tensor potential for the
classical version of our vector Kepler problem, and also
provide a simple physical explanation of the phenomenon
In Section VI we show
(which is much more general).
that HSS is the result of a canonical transformation of
the correct second order adiabatic Hamiltonian; and we
show that this transformation is particularly convenient
because it removes the r−3 singularity. After treating
the quantum version of the problem in Section VII, we
discuss our results and conclude.

We can now obtain the vector Kepler Hamiltonian (2)
from (9) simply by setting ε
0. In this limit, α evolves
inﬁnitely fast according to (10); but α plays no role in the
Kepler analogy, and can simply be ignored. On the other
hand, because α evolves so rapidly, from the equation for
σ in (11) we can easily see that

where ¯σ is a constant. So to zeroth order in ε, H is indeed
equivalent to HAD0, as claimed. And as Fig. 1 conﬁrms,
the evolution of (r, θ) under HAD0 does provide a close
approximation to that under H, over intermediate time
scales. This is not bad; but the errors in using HAD0 do
become large for t of order ε−2. We can do better than
this.

III: POST-ADIABATIC CORRECTIONS:
GEOMETRIC ELECTROMAGNETISM

To improve on our simple adiabatic approximation we
must become systematic about precisely how we are ex-
panding in powers of ε, because there is more than simple

3

perturbation theory going on. The very rapid evolution
of α is a warning of this. In fact the approximate con-
stancy (‘adiabatic invariance’) of σ, on which the Kepler
analogy is based, is directly connected to the rapidity of
α. The fact that α is fast means that the Hamiltonian
varies steeply as a function of its conjugate momentum
σ, and this in turn means that, since H is identically con-
served under time evolution, σ must vary only slowly. So
the rapid variation of α is no accident. And the essential
feature of our adiabatic approximation is that as well as
dropping terms whose magnitude is higher order in ε, we
are also dropping terms, like α, whose variation is on the
rapid timescale ε−1t.

An elegant and general treatment of post-adiabatic
[7]. The result that is
corrections is available in Ref.
reached is physically intuitive: to eliminate rapid evo-
lution while preserving slow evolution, one must remove
rapid components from the Hamiltonian, by averaging
over the rapid angular variable which is canonically con-
jugate to the adiabatic invariant. If we identify σ as the
adiabatic invariant, then α is the rapid variable, and so
we should integrate H over α. In many problems of this
sort, it is common that rapid components of the Hamil-
tonian appear, as they do in (9), as shifts in the posi-
tional momentum. Thus to ﬁrst order in the adiabatic
small parameter (in our case, ε), after integrating out
the rapid co-ordinate one obtains an eﬀective Hamilto-
nian term linear in spatial momentum, ~A
~p for some
function ~A. In our case, this ﬁrst order ~A vanishes, be-
cause the integral over 2π of cos α is zero. But in general
such terms do not vanish. They imply that a neutral
particle with a magnetic moment, moving in a spatially
varying magnetic ﬁeld, experiences a force as though it
were a charged particle moving in an eﬀective magnetic
ﬁeld, whose vector potential is ~A. This phenomenon has
therefore been named ‘geometric magnetism’.

·

At second post-adiabatic order, one typically encoun-
ters a scalar potential; in our case, integrating (9) over α
produces the scalar term

which produces HGEM as given by (3). Continuing the
analogy begun at ﬁrst order, this post-adiabatic scalar
potential may be compared to an eﬀective electric poten-
tial. The eﬀective Hamiltonian produced by averaging H
over α can therefore be said to include geometric electro-
magnetism.

So why does it not work very well? Since integrating
out α has been quite straightforward, we might wonder
whether the observed inaccuracy of HGEM is due simply
to not going on to third or higher order in ε. After all,
ε = 0.2 as in Figs. 1-3 is not really such a small parame-
ter. But H contains no terms beyond order ε2, so if the
rule really is to average over α, then it is not clear where
higher order corrections could come from. And in a case

where ε is truly small, so that diﬀerent orders in ε are
quantitatively obvious, we can check (see Figs. 4 and 5)
that the discrepancy between H and HGEM is indeed a
problem of lower order in ε. In fact there are two inde-
pendent problems, which we will discuss in turn, starting
with the larger but more trivial one.

FIG. 4: The error ∆r(t) = ¯r − r and ∆θ(t) = ¯θ − θ, where ¯r, ¯θ
are r, θ as given by the geometric magnetism approximation.
The quantities plotted are obtained by numerically solving
the same two sets of equations as in Fig. 2, but with ε = 0.01
and ¯r(0) = r(0) = 1.5 (and all other parameters the same as
in the previous Figures). The errors in the pure geometric
electromagnetism approximation are of order ε, rather than
ε3 as desired. For these parameters, however, the heuristic
approximation of Schmiedmayer and Scrinzi does not fare any
better: its errors are not distinguishable to the eye from those
shown here.

IV: INITIAL CONDITIONS

It is surprising that Fig. 4 shows errors of order ε in
evolution under both HGEM and HSS, since they agree
with HAD2 to that order; we should expect them to fail at
(ε2). In fact this expectation is correct, and the reason
O
for the even poorer performance shown in Fig. 4 really
has nothing to do with the form of the Hamiltonian. The
problem is with using the same initial conditions for the
adiabatically approximate evolution as for the exact evo-
lution.

As we can see in Eqn. (12), the system’s several vari-
ables generally evolve as a superposition of slow and
fast components (where the fast components may also
be slowly modulated). Adiabatic approximations seek to
reproduce only the slow components. This means that
initial conditions need some consideration: the exact ini-
tial values pr(0), σ(0), etc., are the instantaneous sums
of slow and fast components of motion; but the adia-
batic approximation requires the initial values of the slow
components alone. We must therefore identify the fast

4

components in our variables, and subtract their instan-
taneous values at t = 0 from the exact initial conditions,
to obtain the initial conditions that should be used with
adiabatically approximate evolution.

Fortunately it is not at all diﬃcult to identify the fast
components. If in (11) we examine the equation of mo-
tion for θ, for instance, we see

We might be puzzled at this point by the fact that in
replacing σ(0) with ¯σ we are actually throwing away some
components that are non-constant but slow, rather than
fast; this does not really seem to ﬁt the logic behind the
procedure. Since in the adiabatic approximation σ has

to be a constant, not just a slow variable, this is clearly
what we have to do. But this point is indeed a problem:
it is the problem discussed in the next Section.

Even if this subtlety did not bother us, when the ad-
justments (17) in initial conditions and σ are made in
evolution under HGEM and HSS, the ﬁrst order errors of
Fig. 4 are reduced, but only to second order; see Figs. 5
and 6. Although HSS has no real credentials at this
(ε2). So we

V: ‘GEOMETRIC GRAVITY’

The second order problem is more profound than the
ﬁrst order problem of initial condtions: it is that HGEM
is incomplete. The scalar potential of GEM is indeed
a second order correction; but as shown by Littlejohn
and Weigert, at second order there also appears a geo-
metric tensor potential: the eﬀective Hamiltonian must
jk pjpkgjk(~x). In analogy
acquire a term of the form
with ‘geometric magnetism’, we can think of the metric
of general relativity, and call this second order eﬀect ‘ge-
ometric gravity’. Converted to our original dimensionful
units, the geometric gravity term derived in [7] is

(We can already notice a point in favour HAD2: it is
numerically equal to the exact H up to second order in
ε, since with the adjusted initial conditions of (17) we
(ε3), and both Hamiltonians
ﬁnd HAD2(0) = H(0) +
are conserved under the evolutions they each generate.)
Where does ‘geometric gravity’ come from? We can
see this by re-examining the equations of motion for σ
and α in (10). We can recall σ(t) as given in (16), and
then by inspection we can also ﬁnd that

So in fact the ﬁrst order correction to the purely fast
zeroth order term in σz contains the slow term ε¯σpθ/r.
Thus at ﬁrst order in ε, it is no longer precisely the spin
component in the ~B direction which is the adiabatic in-
variant. The axis about which the spin precesses rapidly
tilts slightly in the z-direction, so that the spin compo-
nent which varies slowly is not exactly sθ, but rather

FIG. 7: The magnetic particle’s spin (two-toned arrow) pre-
cesses rapidly around an axis (dark arrow) tilted slightly z-
ward from the θ-direction (grey arrow), which is tangential to
the magnetic ﬁeld line (dashed arc). A post-adiabatic approx-
imation that includes only geometric electromagnetism treats
the spin component along the grey arrow as an adiabatic in-
variant. Incorporating ‘geometric gravity’ as well means us-
ing a more accurate adiabatic invariant, the spin component
along the dark arrow.

This means that the adiabatic approximation is not
exactly to average over α, but to average over the variable
conjugate to sθ′. If we now re-write the Hamiltonian H

resolve the concern we raised in the previous Section, im-

of third order or higher); in replacing σ′(0)

(An extra complication in this derivation of HAD2 is
α′, σ′, with-
that the change of variables from α, σ
out also changing pr and pθ, is not canonical. The non-
vanishing Poisson brackets [σ′, pr] and [σ′, θ] are purely
fast quantities, however, and this means that we can ig-
nore this complication. If we also adjusted the momenta
to keep our variables exactly canonical, extra terms not
shown in (23) would appear when H was re-written; but
these extra terms would then vanish in the averaging over
α′.)

FIG. 8: The errors in the correct second order adiabatic ap-
proximation, evolution under HAD2. Parameters are again
ε = 0.01 and the initial conditions on the exact motion are
the same as in Figs. 4-6, while the initial conditions for the
HAD2 approximation are given in terms of the exact initial
conditions by Eqns. (17). Note the change in vertical scale
in comparison with Figs. 6 and 7. On this vertical scale the
rapid component of the exact motion is quite large, but the
unchanged horizontal scale is still too coarse to resolve it,
producing the thick black bands.

O

As illustrated in Fig. 8, when ε is small, HAD2 with
(ε2). The
(17) is accurate for the slow motion even at
power of the adiabatic approximation is truly remark-
able:
it ignores the small, rapid ‘wobble’ in the exact
evolution, and it tracks the slow motion very accurately
over many orbits. The contrast with Fig. 4 shows pri-
marily the eﬀects of correcting the initial conditions ac-
cording to (17), which involves a ﬁrst-order change in the
adiabatic invariant σ from the instantaneous exact σ(0).
Comparing Figs. 5 and 6, however, shows that even with
the improved initial conditions, the simpler approxima-
tions HGEM and HSS are not as accurate as HAD2 in
the illustrated case. We now understand the failings of
HGEM ; and it was not clear in the ﬁrst place why one
should expect HSS to be a good eﬀective Hamiltonian.
But in the case shown in Figs. 1-3, HSS was really ex-
cellent. Why?

VI: PREFERRED CANONICAL CO-ORDINATES

The uncanny eﬀectiveness of HSS, even though it does
not seem to be the correct adiabatic eﬀective Hamilto-
nian HAD2, is very simply explained: HSS actually is
the correct adiabatic eﬀective Hamiltonian, in a diﬀerent
set of variables. If we perform the canonical change of
2 ε2σ in HAD2, then to second order
variables r
in ε we obtain HSS. Hence the heuristic evolution of
Schmiedmayer and Scrinzi would disagree with the cor-
rect adiabatic result only at third or higher order in ε,
if in comparing the two evolutions one also applied the

Using the trivial

initial conditions instead of (17)
σ2(0)/r(0), which
amounted to an error in σ of ε
was of order 1% in the case of Figs. 1-3, and not clearly
discernible in the large-scale plot shown in our ﬁrst three
Figures.
In the smaller r(0) case of Fig. 4, close ex-
amination revealed the error. Taking the correct initial
conditions, but failing to include the co-ordinate shift in
(ε2) error seen in Fig. 7. Yet this simple
r, led to the
co-ordinate shift is in a sense the main reason why HSS
does so much better than HGEM in the strongly precess-
ing case of Figs. 1-3: since the canonical transformation
relating HSS and HAD2 is a constant shift in radius, even
the most naive calculation with HSS gives the orbital pre-
cession with full second-order post-adiabatic accuracy.

O

Just when everything at last seems clear, though, there
is one ﬁnal twist in the classical part of our story: see
Fig. 10.
In some respects the canonical co-ordinates
yielding HSS as the adiabatic eﬀective Hamiltonian are
signiﬁcantly better than those yielding HAD2. For one
thing, HSS itself is more easily solved than HAD2, be-
cause it is eﬀectively just the Kepler Hamiltonian with a
renormalized pθ.

More importantly, though, HAD2 contains a term pro-
portional to ε2r−3, while HSS has no terms more singular
than the r−2 centrifugal barrier. As long as r remains of
order ε0, the more singular term causes no problems; but
for r < √ε, the formally ε2 correction in HAD2 is only
smaller than the zeroth order σ/r term by
(ε), and the
adiabatic hierarchy will begin to break down. Of course,
since the exact Hamiltonian has nothing worse than r−2,
one of the things this breakdown implies is that the r−3
term is not really accurate when r is this small. So while

O

7

the r−3 term is quite accurate at r
(ε0), its singu-
larity at small r is spurious – an artifact of an adiabatic
expansion applied beyond its regime of validity.

≥ O

In contrast, no hierarchy breakdown problems occur
with HSS until r < ε; and even then there is no severe
disaster, because the zeroth order centrifugal barrier still
dominates. So the variables of HSS are better than those
of HAD2 in that they greatly shrink the phase space re-
gion where the adiabatic approach fails, and also reduce
the severity of the failure. And this advantage can trans-
late into signiﬁcantly more accurate results, as shown
in Fig. 10. The highly eccentric orbit in this case, and
the relatively large value of ε, mean that as the particle
approaches the wire HAD2 suﬀers signiﬁcantly in com-
parison with HSS.

FIG. 10: The exact trajectory as in Fig. 1 (solid curve), with
the adiabatic trajectories as given using HSS (long dashes),
and using HAD2 (short dashes).
In both approximations
the initial conditions are given by (17). For HSS evolution,
r(0) = 10 + ε2 ¯σ/2, and then r(t) − ε2 ¯σ/2 is plotted as the
radius. This shift, and the improved initial conditions, make
this corrected implementation of the Schmiedmayer-Scrinzi
approximation even better than the naive implementation
it is barely distinguishable from the exact
shown in Fig. 3:
curve. Although the two dashed trajectories should formally
diﬀer only by order ε3, the breakdown of the adiabatic hierar-
chy as the particle approaches the wire has a much more severe
eﬀect in the HAD2 co-ordinates than in the Schmiedmayer-
Scrinzi co-ordinates.

This raises an interesting question in adiabatic the-
ory. When the separation of time scales does not apply
over the entire phase space, it may be that the nonadia-
batic region (in which there is no time scale separation)
can be patched into the adiabatic region (in which there
is good separation of time scales) more smoothly with
some canonical coordinates than with others. Is there a
systematic way of identifying the better co-ordinates, in
general? In this paper, we can do no more than raise this
question as a subject for future investigation.

In classical mechanics this issue is not a problem if one
simply avoids the nonadiabatic region, such as by consid-
ering orbits that maintain r >> ε. In quantum mechan-
ics, though, the problem is in principle much more severe.

The energy spectrum of HSS is well behaved, and can
even be obtained exactly (though HSS itself is of course
only a second order approximation); but the spectrum
of HAD2 with positive σ is continuously unbounded from
below. One can of course recognize the spuriousness of
these negative energy states, and try to discard them in
(Semiclassical calculations, for instance,
various ways.
will essentially reduce the advantages of HSS over HAD2
to only those that we have noted classically.) If numerical
methods are required, however, as they may well be for
more complicated problems than the one we have been
considering, a spurious singularity introduced by adia-
batic elimination might be quite a serious obstacle.

VII: THE QUANTUM VECTOR KEPLER
PROBLEM

That such problems can indeed arise quantum mechan-
ically is conﬁrmed by quantizing our vector Kepler prob-
lem. Keeping track of what our rescalings have done to
the commutation relations, we ﬁnd the time-independent
Schr¨odinger equation corresponding to (9):

where Ψ = Ψ(r) is spinor-valued, σx,z are the spin-s

To obtain the equation in this form we have already used
a θ-dependent spin basis such that sx is in the local θ-
direction, and set pθ →
Remembering what we learned classically about the
tilting of the adiabatic invariant, we can make a short-

If we at last deﬁne √rΦ(r) = √rf (r

For the special case s = ¯h/2, (29) is not only accurate
(ε2), but is actually exact [11]. This was precisely
to
what motivated Schmiedmayer and Scrinzi to consider
their eﬀective Hamiltonian for general s. For other val-
ues of s and a range of values of J, numerical results in
(ε4). The
Ref. [9] show that (29) is actually accurate to
success of the heuristic formula in [9] appeared to be the
success of a mysterious rival to standard adiabatic the-
ory; but the mysterious rival has now been revealed as
standard adiabatic theory in a thin (but evidently useful)
disguise.

O

Comparison with most other treatments of the quan-
tum vector Kepler problem is not relevant, because they
examine predominantly cases of small J, where the adi-
abatic method does not perform well. Ref. [12] provides
numerical results in only one case where ε is really small,
namely the exactly solvable case s = ¯h/2 and J = 11¯h/2.
The reported results of the adiabatic calculation in [12]
show errors of order ε4 in this case. As far we under-
stand, it is only fortuitous that our results are actually
better than this; but perhaps some advantage is due to

the fact that the adiabatic technique used in [12] is un-
controlled, whereas ours is a systematic expansion in the
small parameter ε. The eﬀective potential (for the bound
channel) used in [12] is, in our units,

that the adiabatic eﬀective Hamiltonians may have sin-
gularities like the r−3 potential of our HAD2, which are
unphysical artifacts of applying the adiabatic formalism
beyond its domain of applicability.

VIII: DISCUSSION

Adiabatic methods are a remarkably powerful analyt-
ical tool. Their power often does seem to be remark-
able, in the sense that they frequently deliver accuracy
greater than one can naively expect. The robustness of
adiabatic approximations has perhaps not yet been fully
understood. For example, an interesting issue that we
have raised in this paper concerns the possibility that
the hierarchy of time scales, upon which adiabatic meth-
ods depend, may break down within a localized region of
phase space. A classical system may then evolve outside
this region for most of its history, so that its behaviour
can be closely approximated adiabatically, but in a suc-
cession of intervals of ‘crisis’, it may pass brieﬂy through
the region where adiabatic methods fail to apply. During
the interval of crisis the fast degrees of freedom do not de-
couple from the (nominally) slow ones, and so the precise
state of the fast variables might aﬀect the slow variables
in ways that could persist after the crisis. Thus the fast
degrees of freedom, which within the adiabatic regime are
eﬀectively hidden variables, could ‘emerge’ during crises.
While this kind of emergence of hidden variables has
(presumably) nothing to do with quantum measurement,
the classical phenomenon will have analogues in quantum
mechanics. The eﬀective Hamiltonians given by standard
adiabatic techniques may be unreliable in some regions
of Hilbert space. The result may in principle be spuri-
ous simplicity, but it may also be spurious complexity, in

In diﬃcult cases of this kind, whether quantum or
classical, a kind of connection formula would seem to
be needed, from which one could compute the time and
phase space location at which the system would exit the
region of adiabatic breakdown. In the problem studied
in this paper, however, we have seen that a co-ordinate
change can eliminate a spurious singularity, producing
an eﬀective Hamiltonian which does not seem to need a
connection formula. It would clearly be desirable to de-
termine whether this is simply a fortunate coincidence
in this one case, or whether there may exist a general
method of identifying the best co-ordinates, and mini-
mizing the damage done by what we have called crisis
regions.

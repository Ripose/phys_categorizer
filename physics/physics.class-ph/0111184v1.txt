INTRODUCTION

Diﬀerent cooling methods were suggested to decrease
the emittances and to compress the phase-space density
of charged particle beams in storage rings. All of them,
except the stochastic one, are based on a friction of parti-
cles in external electromagnetic ﬁelds or in media. Below
we will consider laser methods of enhanced cooling of
electron beams based on friction. The main results will
be valid for cooling of other particles.

II. METHODS OF COOLING OF PARTICLE
BEAMS IN STORAGE RINGS

In the ordinary three-dimensional radiative method of
cooling of electron beams a laser beam overlaps an elec-
tron beam, its transverse position is motionless, all elec-
trons interact with the laser beam independent of their
energy and amplitude of betatron oscillations. A friction
originating in the process of emission (scattering) of laser
photons by electrons leads to a damping of amplitudes
of both betatron and phase oscillations of electrons. The
damping is because of the friction force is parallel to the
electron velocity, and therefore the momentum losses in-
clude both the transverse and longitudinal ones. The lon-
gitudinal momentum losses are compensated by a radio
frequency accelerating system of the storage ring. Mean-
while the longitudinal momentum of the electron tends
to a certain equilibrium. The transverse vertical and ra-
dial momenta disappear irreversibly. The diﬀerence in
rates of momentum loss of electrons having maximum
and minimum energies in the beam is small, and that is
why the cooling time of the electron beam is high.

When a cooling is produced in a dispersion-free
straight section and the laser beam intensity is constant
inside the area of the laser beam occupied by a being
cooled electron beam, then the damping times of the hor-
izontal vertical and phase oscillations are:

The coupling arising in non-zero dispersion straight
sections of the storage rings leads to a redistribution of
the longitudinal and radial damping times when the ra-
dial gradient of the laser beam intensity is introduced.

The method of enhanced one-dimensional laser cooling
of ion beams is based on the resonance Rayleigh scatter-
ing of laser photons by not fully stripped ion beams or

overlaps the ion beam and has a chirp of frequency. Ions
interact with the laser beam at resonance energy, de-
crease their energy in the process of the laser frequency
scanning until all of them reach the minimum energy of
ions in the beam. At this frequency the laser beam is
switched oﬀ. The higher energy of ions the longer the
time of interaction of ions with the laser beam. Ions of
minimum energy do not interact with the laser beam at
all. In such a way, in this method, the selective interac-
tion is realized. The damping time of the ion beam in
the longitudinal plane is determined by the dispersion of
its energy spread σε

According to (1), the damping times of betatron
and phase oscillations in the three-dimensional radiative
method of cooling are equal to the time interval necessary
for the electron energy loss, which is about the two-fold
and four-fold initial energy of the electron, accordingly.

A one-dimensional method of ion cooling has been
realized by now [1] - [5]. A three-dimensional radia-
tive method of laser cooling of ion beams by broad-
band laser beams was suggested and developed in [6] -
[9] by the analogy with the synchrotron radiation damp-
ing of amplitudes of betatron and phase oscillations of
particles in storage rings1. The electron version of the
three-dimensional radiative cooling was developed by

latter may be neglected when length of the ion decay is much
less than that of the period of ion betatron oscillations [6], [8].

III. ENHANCED LASER COOLING OF
ELECTRON BEAMS

The enhanced cooling of particle beams either in the
longitudinal or transverse planes can be done by using a
universal kind of selective interaction of particles with
laser beams and media targets. Selective interaction
means that the laser beam or media target interacts with
one part of the being cooled beam and does not interact
with the rest.

A. Cooling methods based on selective interaction
of electron and laser beams and on dispersion
coupling of the transverse and longitudinal
motion of electrons in storage rings

For the sake of simplicity we will neglect the emission of
the synchrotron radiation in the bending magnets of the
storage rings, supposing that the RF system of a storage
ring is switched oﬀ and the laser beams are homogeneous
and have sharp edges in the radial directions. We suppose
that the dispersion of the energy loss of electrons in the
laser beam is small and the jump of their instantaneous
orbits caused by the energy loss is less than the amplitude
of betatron oscillations.

In a smooth approximation, the movement of an elec-
tron relative to its instantaneous orbit is described by the
equation

xβ = A cos(Ωt + ϕ).

lows that to produce the enhanced cooling of an elec-
tron beam in the transverse plane we must create such
conditions when electrons interact with a laser beam un-
der deviations from the instantaneous orbit xβ0 of one
sign (xβ 0 < 0, when the dispersion function is pos-
itive ∂xη/∂ε > 0 or in the opposite case xβ 0 > 0,
∂xη/∂ε < 0). In this case the value δA has one sign and
the rate of change of amplitudes of betatron oscillations
of electrons ∂A/∂t is maximum. A selective interaction
of electrons with the laser beam is necessary to realize
this case.

FIG. 1: The scheme of the enhanced electron cooling.
The axis ”y” is the equilibrium orbit of the storage ring; T1
and T2 the laser beams. The transverse positions of laser
beams are displaced with the velocity ~vT1,2 relative to the
equilibrium orbit, 1-1, 2-2, ... the location of the instanta-
neous electron orbit, and 1,2,3, ... the electron trajectories

In Fig.1, two schemes of a selective interaction of elec-
tron and laser beams are shown for cooling of electron
beams in the transverse and longitudinal planes. For the
transverse cooling, the laser beam T1 is used. At the
initial moment it overlaps a small external part of the

electron beam in the radial direction in the straight sec-
tion of the storage ring with non zero dispersion function.
First electrons with largest initial amplitudes of betatron
oscillations interact with the laser beam. Immediately af-
ter the interaction and loss of the energy the position and
direction of momentum of an electron remain the same,
but the instantaneous orbit is displaced inward in the di-
rection of the laser beam. The radial coordinate of the
instantaneous orbit and the amplitude of betatron oscil-
lations are decreased to the same value owing to the dis-
persion coupling. After every interaction the position of
the instantaneous orbit approaches the laser beam more
and more, and the amplitude of betatron oscillations is
coming smaller. It will reach some small value when the
instantaneous orbit reaches the edge of the laser beam.
When the depth of dipping of the instantaneous orbit
of the electron in the laser beam becomes greater than
the amplitude of its betatron oscillations, the orbit will
continue its movement in the laser beam with constant
velocity. The amplitude of betatron oscillations will not
be changed.

The degree of overlapping is changed by moving uni-
formly the laser beam position from inside in the direc-
tion of the being cooled electron beam with some velocity
3. When the laser beam reaches the instantaneous or-
vT1
bit corresponding to electrons of maximum energies then
the laser beam must be switched oﬀ and returned to a
previous position. All electrons of the beam will have
small amplitudes of betatron oscillations and increased
energy spread. Electrons with high amplitudes of beta-
tron oscillations will start to interact with a laser beam
ﬁrst, their duration of interaction and absolute decrease
of amplitudes of betatron oscillations will be higher.

To realize the enhanced cooling of an electron beam in
the longitudinal plane we can use a laser beam T2 located
in the straight section of a storage ring with non zero dis-
persion function (see Fig.1). The radial laser beam posi-
tion is moving uniformly from outside in the direction of
the being cooled electron beam with a velocity vT2 higher
than maximum velocity of the electron instantaneous or-
bit deepened in the laser beam. At the initial moment,
the laser beam overlaps only a small part of the electron
beam. The degree of overlapping is changed in such a
way that electrons of maximum energy, ﬁrst and then
electrons of lesser energy, come into interaction. When
the laser beam reaches the orbit of electrons of minimum
energy then it must be switched oﬀ and returned to the
previous position. In this case, the rate of the energy loss
of electrons in the beam will not be increased, but the
diﬀerence in duration of interaction and hence in the en-
ergy losses of electrons having maximum and minimum

3

energies will be increased essentially. As a result all elec-
trons will be gathered at the minimum energy in a short
time.

B.

Interaction of electron beams with transversely

moving laser beams

·

In the methods of enhanced laser cooling of electron
beams the internal and external laser beam positions are
displaced in the transverse directions (see Fig.1). Below
the evolution of amplitudes of betatron oscillations and
positions of instantaneous orbits in the process of the
energy loss of electrons in laser beams will be analyzed.
The velocity of an electron instantaneous orbit ˙xη de-
xη between the edge of
pends on the distance xT1,2 −
the laser beam and the instantaneous orbit, and on the
amplitude of betatron oscillations. When the orbit en-
ters the laser beam at the depth higher than the ampli-
tude of betatron oscillations then electrons interact with
the laser beam every turn and theirs velocity reaches the
maximum value ˙xη in which is given by the intensity and
the length of the interaction region of the electron and
laser beams. In the general case, the velocity ˙xη can be
˙xη in, where W is the
presented in the form ˙xη = W
probability of an electron crossing the laser beam. W is
the ratio to a period of a part of the period of betatron
oscillations of the electron determined by the condition
A when the deviation of the elec-

|
tron from the instantaneous orbit at azimuths of the laser
beam is directed to the laser beam and is greater than
the distance between the orbit and the laser beam. When
the length of the laser beam is much less than the length
of the period of electron betatron oscillations, the prob-
ability can be presented in the form W = ϕ1,2/π, where

tion ∂A/∂xη =

electron deviation from the instantaneous orbit averaged

this purpose.

Suppose that the initial spread of amplitudes of be-

instantaneous orbits of the beam. The velocities of the
instantaneous orbits in a laser beam ˙xη in < 0, the trans-

desirable to use the straight sections with low-beta and
high dispersion functions when lesser events of photon
emission are required to cool the beam in the transverse
direction, as the change of amplitudes of betatron oscilla-
tions of electrons is of the order of the change of positions
of their instantaneous orbits. Meanwhile, the spread of
amplitudes of betatron oscillations is small and the step
between positions of instantaneous orbits is high.

Similar method of interaction of external and inter-
nal targets with proton beams was described in 1956 by
O’Neil [13, 14]. However, O’Neil considered the ques-
tion of damping of betatron oscillations of proton beams
in the transverse direction by means of motionless solid
wedge-shaped material targets. The targets in that case
could not provide any enhanced cooling4. They could
be used for injection and capture of only one portion
of protons. For the multi-cycle injection and storage of
protons O’Neil suggested an ordinary three-dimensional
ionization cooling based on a thin hydrogen jet target
located in a working region of the storage ring.

In the method of the enhanced longitudinal laser cool-
ing of electron beams a laser beam T2 is located in the
region (xT2 , xT2 +a) (see Fig. 1). Its radial position is dis-

When the laser beam reaches the instantaneous orbit of
electrons having minimum initial energies it must be re-
moved to the initial position.

The evolution of instantaneous orbits of electrons in-
teracting with the laser beam depends on the initial am-
plitudes of betatron oscillations of these electrons. First
of all the laser beam T2 interacts with electrons hav-
ing the largest initial amplitudes of betatron oscillations
A0 = σx,b,0 and the highest energies. The instantaneous
orbit of these electrons, according to (8) - (10), is changed

electrons with the laser beam. At the same time instanta-
neous orbits xη2 of electrons having the same maximum
energy but zero amplitudes of betatron oscillations are

IV. DISCUSSION

The dynamics of instantaneous orbits and amplitudes
of betatron oscillations of electrons depends on the depth
of deepening of their instantaneous orbits in the laser
beam and on the amplitudes. Moreover, the being dis-
placed laser beam begins to interact with electrons of the
beam located at diﬀerent instantaneous orbits at diﬀer-
ent moments of time and interacts for diﬀerent periods of
time. These features of selective interaction of the mov-
ing laser beams lead to the enhanced cooling of electron
beams either in the transverse or longitudinal planes.

In the method of the enhanced transverse laser cool-
ing of electron beams, according to (14) and (15), the
degree of transverse compression is C1 = A0/A =
and the increase in the spread of the

1 . At the same time in the method of the enhanced lon-
gitudinal laser cooling, according to (17) and (21), there
is a signiﬁcant decrease in the spread of instantaneous
orbits of electrons deﬁned by the compression coeﬃcient

C2,l = σx,ε,0/σx,ε,f , and a lesser value of increase in the
√C2. From this
amplitudes of betatron oscillations D2
it follows that cooling of electron beams both in the trans-
verse and longitudinal planes, in turn or simultaneously,
does not lead to their total cooling in these planes. We
can cool electron beams either in the transverse or longi-
tudinal planes or look for combinations of these methods
of cooling with other methods.

≃

In the method of enhanced longitudinal laser cooling,
contrary to the transverse one, the degree of longitudinal
cooling is greater than the degree of heating in the trans-
verse plane. That is why we can use the emittance ex-
change between longitudinal and transverse planes, e.g.,
using a synchro-betatron resonance [15, 16, 17, 18] or
dispersion coupling by motionless wedge-shaped targets
[13, 14, 19] and in such a way to realize the enhanced
two-dimensional cooling of the electron beam based on
the longitudinal laser cooling only5.

When the synchrotron radiation damping of electron
beams in guiding magnetic ﬁelds of lattices of storage
rings is high and the radio frequency accelerating system
is switched on then we can do an additional enhanced
laser cooling of such beams in the radio frequency buck-
ets. Such cooling in the longitudinal plane can be pro-
duced by using of a being displaced laser beam T2 at the
condition when losses of energy by electrons in the laser
beam are higher than synchrotron radiation losses. Cool-
ing of the electron beams in the RF buckets is another
problem to be considered elsewhere.

Notice that in the case of the three dimensional laser
cooling of electron beams considered in [10] the spread
of amplitudes of betatron oscillations is small and the
energy spread and the spread of instantaneous orbits of
electrons is high in another straight section if it has a high
dispersion and low β-function. That is why we can locate
the laser beam T2 at this section and produce an addi-
tional longitudinal cooling one, two or more times. Then
we can use the beam with low transverse and longitudinal
emittances for generation of spontaneous or stimulated
radiation in the storage ring or extract it for injection to
a linear collider.

The enhanced transverse method of laser cooling to-
gether with the ordinary one-dimensional one (see section
2) can be used for cooling of ion beams. Broad-band laser
beam must be used in this case. A heating of ion beam in
the longitudinal plane in the ﬁrst method of cooling will
be compensated completely by its cooling in the same
plane in the one-dimensional method. If the laser beam
in the ﬁrst method of cooling has a broad spectrum with
sharp frequency edge corresponding to an energy lesser
than the minimal energy of the being cooled ion beam
then the one-dimensional method can be omitted. All
ions will be cooled in the transverse plane and gathered

5 Similar way a cooling of muon beams can be done by material

targets.

at some energy lesser than minimal. The enhanced trans-
verse laser cooling method is, at the same time, the en-
hanced longitudinal method for ion beams. Cooling of
ions in both planes is possible in radio frequency buckets
as well.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have presented methods of enhanced
laser cooling of particle beams in transverse and longitu-
dinal planes. We hope that these methods can be used for
cooling of ion and muon beams in storage rings intended

for the elementary particle physics. The development and
adoption of these methods can lead to new generations
of light sources of spontaneous incoherent and stimulated
radiation from optical to X-ray and γ-ray regions based
on electron and ion storage rings [9, 10, 20]. Using of
circular polarized laser beams for cooling can lead to a
longitudinal polarization of stored e± beams in storage
rings with more complicated lattices [21] - [23]. Hard
circular polarized powerful photon beams produced in
the process of the Backward Compton Scattering of laser
photons by electrons in storage rings can be used for a
production in material targets of longitudinally polarized
positron beams for linear colliders [24].

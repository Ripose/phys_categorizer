Circular Orbits Inside the Sphere of Death

Joseph Henry Laboratories, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544

Kirk T. McDonald

(November 8, 1993)

Abstract

A wheel or sphere rolling without slipping on the inside of a sphere in a uniform grav-
itational ﬁeld can have stable circular orbits that lie wholly above the “equator”, while a
particle sliding freely cannot.

1 Introduction

In a recent article [1] in this Journal, Abramowicz and Szuszkiewicz remarked on an inter-
esting analogy between orbits above the equator of a “wall of death” and orbits near a black
hole; namely that the centrifugal force in both cases appears to point towards rather than
away from the center of an appropriate coordinate system. Here we take a “wall of death”
to be a hollow sphere on the Earth’s surface large enough that a motorcycle can be driven
on the inside of the sphere. The intriguing question is whether there exist stable orbits for
the motorcycle that lie entirely above the equator (horizontal great circle) of the sphere.

In ref. [1] the authors stated that no such orbits are possible, perhaps recalling the well-
known result for a particle sliding freely on the inside of a sphere in a uniform gravitational
ﬁeld. However, the extra degrees of freedom associated with a rolling wheel (or sphere)
actually do permit such orbits, in apparent deﬁance of intuition. In particular, the friction
associated with the condition of rolling without slipping can in some circumstances have an
upward component large enough to balance all other downward forces.

In this paper we examine the character of all circular orbits inside a ﬁxed sphere, for both
wheels and spheres that roll without slipping. The rolling constraint is velocity dependent
(non-holonomous), so explicit use of a Lagrangian is not especially eﬀective.
Instead we
follow a vectorial approach as advocated by Milne (Chap. 17) [2]. This approach does utilize
the rolling constraint, a careful choice of coordinates, and the elimination of the constraint
force from the equations of motion, all of which are implicit in Lagrange’s method. The
vector approach is, of course, a convenient codiﬁcation of earlier methods in which individual
components were explicitly written out. Compare with classic works such as those of Lamb
(Chap. 9) [3], Deimel (Chap. 7) [4] and Routh (Chap. 5) [5].

Once the solutions are obtained in sec. 2 for rolling wheels we make a numerical evaluation
of the magnitude of the acceleration in g’s, and of the required coeﬃcient of static friction
on some representative orbits. The resulting parameters are rather extreme, and the circus
name “sphere of death” seems apt.

The stability of steady orbits of wheels is considered in some detail, but completely
general results are not obtained (because the general motion has four degrees of freedom).

1

All vertical orbits are shown to be stable, as are horizontal orbits around the equator of the
sphere. We also ﬁnd that all horizontal orbits away from the poles are stable in the limit of
small wheels, and conjecture that the a similar condition holds for “death-defying” orbits of
large wheels above the equator of the sphere. In sec. 4 we lend support to this conjecture
by comparing to the related case of a sphere rolling within a sphere for which a complete
stability analysis can be given.

Discussions of wheels and spheres rolling outside a ﬁxed sphere are given in secs. 3 and

5, respectively.

2 Wheel Rolling Inside a Fixed Sphere

2.1 Generalities

We consider a wheel of radius a rolling without slipping on a circular orbit on the inner
surface of a sphere of radius r > a. The analysis is performed in the lab frame, in which the
sphere is ﬁxed. The z-axis is vertical and upwards with origin at the center of the sphere as
shown in Fig. 1. As the wheel rolls on the sphere, the point of contact traces a path that is
an arc of a circle during any short interval. In steady motion the path forms closed circular
orbits which are of primary interest here. We therefore introduce a set of axes (x′, y′, z′) that
are related to the circular motion of the point of contact. If the motion is steady, these axes
are ﬁxed in the lab frame.

The normal to the plane of the circular orbit through the center of the sphere (and also
through the center of the circle) is labeled z′. The angle between axes z and z′ is β with
0 ≤ β ≤ π/2. A radius from the center of the sphere to the point of contact of the wheel
sweeps out a cone of angle θ about the z′ axis, where 0 ≤ θ ≤ π. The azimuthal angle of the
point of contact on this cone is called φ, with φ = 0 deﬁned by the direction of the x′-axis,
which is along the projection of the z-axis onto the plane of the orbit, as shown in Fig. 2.
Unit vectors are labeled with a superscript ˆ, so that ˆy′ = ˆz′ × ˆx′ completes the deﬁnition
of the ′-coordinate system.
For a particle sliding freely, the only stationary orbits have β = 0 (horizontal circles) or
β = π/2 (vertical great circles). For wheels and spheres rolling inside a sphere it turns out
that β = 0 or π/2 also, as we will demonstrate. However, the friction at the point of contact
in the rolling cases permits orbits with a larger range of θ than in the sliding case. If β = 0
or π/2 were accepted as an assumption the derivation could be shortened somewhat.

We also introduce a right-handed coordinate triad of unit vectors (ˆ1, ˆ2, ˆ3) related to the
geometry of the wheel. Axis ˆ1 lies along the symmetry axis of the wheel as shown shown in
Fig. 1. Axis ˆ3 is directed from the center of the wheel to the point of contact of the wheel
with the sphere. The vector from the center of the wheel to the point of contact is then

a = aˆ3.

(1)

Axis ˆ2 = ˆ3 × ˆ1 lies in the plane of the wheel, and also in the plane of the orbit (the x′-y′
plane). The sense of axis ˆ1 is chosen so that the component ω1 of the angular velocity vector

2

Figure 1: A wheel of radius a rolls without slipping on a circular orbit inside
a ﬁxed sphere of radius r. The orbit sweeps out a cone of angle θ about the
z′-axis, which axis makes angle β to the vertical. The x′-axis is orthogonal
to the z′-axis in the z-z′ plane The angle between the plane of the orbit and
diameter of the wheel that includes the point of contact with the sphere is
denoted by α. A right-handed triad of unit vectors, (ˆ1, ˆ2, ˆ3), is deﬁned with
ˆ1 along the axis of the wheel and ˆ3 pointing from the center of the wheel to
the point of contact.

~ω of the wheel about this axis is positive. Consequently, axis ˆ2 points in the direction of the
velocity of the point of contact, and therefore is parallel to the tangent to the orbit.

Except for axis ˆ1, these rotating axes are not body axes, but the inertia tensor is diagonal

with respect to them. We write

I11 = 2kma2,

I22 = kma2 = I33,

(2)

which holds for any circularly symmetric disc according to the perpendicular axis theorem;
k = 1/2 for a wheel of radius a with mass m concentrated at the rim, k = 1/4 for a uniform
disc, etc.

The wheel does not necessarily lie in the plane of the orbit. Indeed, it is the freedom
to “bank” the wheel that makes the “death-defying” orbits possible. The diameter of the
wheel through the point of contact (i.e., axis ˆ3) makes angle α to the plane of the orbit.
In general, a wheel can have an arbitrary rotation about the ˆ3-axis, but the wheel will roll
steadily along a closed circular orbit orbit only if angular velocity component ω3 is such that
the plane of the wheel intersects the plane of the orbit along the tangent to the orbit at the
point of contact. Hence, for steady motion we will be able to deduce a constraint on ω3.
The case of a rolling sphere is distinguished by the absence of this constraint, as considered
later.

Figure 2: The azimuth of the point of contact of the wheel with the sphere
to the x′-axis is φ. The unit vector ˆr′ is orthogonal to the z′-axis and points
towards the center of the wheel (or equivalently, towards the point of contact).
Unit vector ˆ2 = ˆ3 × ˆ1 = ˆz′ × ˆr′.

Since the wheel lies inside the sphere, as shown in Fig. 3, we can readily deduce the

geometric relation that

θ − π + sin−1(a/r) < α < θ − sin−1(a/r).

(3)

Figure 3: Geometry illustrating the extremes of angle α.

It is useful to introduce r′ = r′ˆr′ as the perpendicular vector from the z′-axis to the center

of the wheel. The magnitude r′ is given by

r′ = r sin θ − a cos α,

4

(4)

as shown in Fig. 4. The vector ˆz′ × ˆr′ is in the direction of motion of the point of contact,
which was deﬁned previously to be direction ˆ2. That is, (ˆr′, ˆ2, ˆz′) form a right-handed unit
triad, which is related to the triad (ˆ1, ˆ2, ˆ3) by

and

as can be seen from Fig. 1.

ˆz′ = − cos αˆ1 − sin αˆ3,

ˆr′ = ˆ2 × ˆz′ = − sin αˆ1 + cos αˆ3,

(5)

(6)

The length r′ is negative when the center of the wheel is on the opposite side of the z′-axis
from the point of contact. This can occur for large enough a/r when the point of contact is
near the z′-axis, such as when θ ≈ 0 and α < 0 or θ ≈ π and α > 0.

Figure 4: Geometry illustrating the vector rcm from the center of the sphere
to the center of the wheel, and the distance r′ = r sin θ − a cos α from the
z′-axis to the center of the wheel.

The force of contact of the sphere on the wheel is labeled F. For the wheel to be in contact
with the sphere the force F must have a component towards the center of the sphere, which
will be veriﬁed after the motion is obtained.

The equation of motion of the center of mass of the wheel is

dt2 = F − mgˆz,

(7)

where g is the acceleration due to gravity. The equation of motion for the angular momentum
Lcm about the center of mass is

The constraint that the wheel rolls without slipping relates the velocity of the center of
mass to the angular velocity vector ~ω of the wheel. In particular, the velocity vanishes for
that point on the wheel instantaneously in contact with the sphere:

and hence

vcontact = vcm + ~ω × a = 0,

vcm =

drcm

= aˆ3 × ~ω.

Multiplying this equation by ˆ3, we ﬁnd

~ω = −ˆ3 ×

vcm

+ ω3ˆ3.

(10)

(11)

(12)

Equations (7)-(12) hold whether the rolling object is a wheel or a sphere.

The strategy now is to extract as much information as possible about the angular velocity
~ω before confronting the full equation of motion (9). The angular velocity can also be written
in terms of the unit vector ˆ1 along the symmetry axis of the wheel as

~ω = ω1ˆ1 + ˆ1 ×

dˆ1
dt

.

(13)

This follows on writing ~ω = ω1ˆ1 + ~ω⊥, and noting that the rate of change of the body vector
ˆ1 is just dˆ1/dt = ~ω⊥ × ˆ1, so ~ω⊥ = ˆ1× dˆ1/dt. Using eq. (2), the angular momentum can now
be written as

Lcm =

~~I · ~ω = 2kma2ω1ˆ1 + kma2ˆ1 ×

dˆ1
dt

.

(14)

2.2 Steady Motion in a Circle

To obtain additional relations we restrict our attention to orbits in which the point of contact
of the wheel with the sphere moves in a closed circle. In such cases the center of mass of the
wheel (and also the coordinate triad (ˆ1, ˆ2, ˆ3)) has angular velocity ˙φ about the ˆz′-axis (and
no other component), where the dot means diﬀerentiation with respect to time. Thus

Equation (12) can now be evaluated, yielding

vcm = ˙φˆz′ × r′ˆr′ = r′ ˙φˆ2.

ˆω = (r′/a) ˙φˆ1 + ω3ˆ3.

(15)

(16)

For steady motion there can be no rotation about axis ˆ2; angle α is constant. To ﬁnd ω3 we
now pursue eq. (13).

As argued above, the angular velocity ~γ of the triad (ˆ1, ˆ2, ˆ3) is

using eq. (5). Then,

~γ = ˙φˆz′ = − ˙φ cos αˆ1 − ˙φ sin αˆ3,

dˆ1

= ~γ × ˆ1 = − ˙φ sin αˆ2

(17)

(18)

dˆ2

= ~γ × ˆ2 = ˙φ sin αˆ1 − ˙φ cos αˆ3 = − ˙φˆr′,

and

It immediately follows that

dˆ3
dt

= ~γ × ˆ3 = ˙φ cos αˆ2.

dˆ1
dt

ˆ1 ×

= − ˙φ sin αˆ3.

Comparing with eq (13) we see that ω3 = − ˙φ sin α and hence from eq. (16) we ﬁnd

~ω = (r′/a) ˙φˆ1 − ˙φ sin αˆ3.

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

As anticipated, the rolling constraint speciﬁes how ω1 and ω3 are both related to the angular
velocity ˙φ of the wheel about the ˆz′-axis.

For use in the equation of motion (9) we can now write

L =

~~I · ~ω = kma2[2(r′/a) ˙φˆ1 − ˙φ sin αˆ3],

and hence,

1
ma

dL

= 2kr′ ¨φˆ1 − k ˙φ2 sin α(2r′ + a cos α)ˆ2 − ka ¨φ sin αˆ3,

using eqs. (18-20). Also, by diﬀerentiating eq. (15) we ﬁnd

so that

d2rcm
dt2 = r′ ˙φ2 sin αˆ1 + r′ ¨φˆ2 − r′ ˙φ2 cos αˆ3,

ˆ3 ×

d2rcm
dt2 = −r′ ¨φˆ1 + r′ ˙φ2 sin αˆ2.

Combining (9), (24) and (26), the equation of motion reads

= −(2k + 1)r′ ¨φˆ1 + [(2k + 1)r′ + ka cos α] ˙φ2 sin αˆ2 + ka ¨φ sin αˆ3.

To evaluate ˆz× ˆ3, we ﬁrst express ˆz in terms of the triad (ˆr′, ˆ2, ˆz′), and then transform to
triad (ˆ1, ˆ2, ˆ3). When the point of contact of the wheel (and hence the ˆr′-axis) has azimuth
φ relative to the ˆx′ axis, the ˆz axis has azimuth −φ relative to the ˆr′ axis. Hence,
ˆz = sin β cos φˆr′ − sin β sin φˆ2 + cos βˆz′

(28)
= −(cos α cos β + sin α sin β cos φ)ˆ1 − sin β sin φˆ2 − (sin α cos β − cos α sin β cos φ)ˆ3,

using eqs. (5)-(6). Thus,

ˆz × ˆ3 = − sin β sin φˆ1 + (cos α cos β + sin α sin β cos φ)ˆ2.

(29)

7

The ˆ1, ˆ2 and ˆ3 components of the equation of motion are now

(2k + 1)r′ ¨φ = g sin β sin φ,

[(2k + 1)r′ + ka cos α] ˙φ2 sin α = g(cos α cos β + sin α sin β cos φ),

and

ka ¨φ sin α = 0.

The cone angle θ enters the equations of motion only through r′.

(30)

(31)

(32)

2.2.1 Vertical Orbits

From eq. (32) we learn that for circular orbits either sin α = 0 or ¨φ = 0. We ﬁrst consider
the simpler case that sin α = 0, which implies that the plane of the wheel lies in the plane
of the orbit. For a wheel inside the sphere with sin α = 0, we must have α = 0 to satisfy the
geometric constraint (3). Then eq. (31) can only be satisﬁed if cos β = 0; i.e., β = π/2 and
the plane of the orbit is vertical. The remaining equation of motion (30) now reads

(2k + 1)r′ ¨φ = g sin φ,

with r′ = r sin θ − a > 0, which integrates to
mr′2( ˙φ2 − ˙φ2

2k + 1

2

0) = mgr′(1 − cos φ),

(33)

(34)

where ˙φ0 is the angular velocity at the top of the orbit at which φ = 0. Equation (34)
expresses conservation of energy. The angular velocity ~ω and the angular momentum Lcm
vary in magnitude but are always perpendicular to the plane of the orbit.

The requirement that the wheel stay in contact with the sphere is that the contact force
F have component F⊥ that points to the center of the sphere. On combining eqs. (7), (25),
(29) and (33) we ﬁnd

F =

2k

2k + 1

mg sin φˆ2 + m(g cos φ − r′ ˙φ2)ˆ3.

(35)

The contact force is in the plane of the orbit, so the resulting torque about the center of
mass of the wheel changes the magnitude but not the direction of the angular momentum.
On the vertical orbits, axis ˆ2 is tangent to the sphere, and axis ˆ3 makes angle π/2 − θ to
the radius from the center of the sphere to the point of contact. Hence

F⊥ = −F3 sin θ

(36)

is positive and the orbit is physical so long as the angular velocity ˙φ0 at the peak of the orbit
obeys

˙φ2
0 >

g
r′ ,

(37)

as readily deduced from elementary considerations as well.

8

The required coeﬃcient µ of static friction is given by µ = Fk/F⊥ where

Fk = qF 2

3 cos θ2 + F 2

2

is the component of the contact force parallel to the surface of the sphere. We see that

µ = cot θq1 + (F2/F3 cos θ)2,

(38)

(39)

which must be greater than cot θ, but only much greater if the wheel nearly loses contact

at the top of the orbit. Hence orbits with π/4 <∼ θ ≤ π/2 are consistent with the friction of
typical rubber wheels, namely µ <∼ 1.

Because a wheel experiences friction at the point of contact, vertical orbits are possible
with θ < π/2. This is in contrast to the case of a particle sliding freely on the inside of a
sphere for which the only vertical orbits are great circles (θ = π/2). The only restriction
in the present case is that the wheel ﬁts inside the sphere, i.e., r sin θ > a, and that the
minimum angular velocity satisfy eq. (37).

2.2.2 Horizontal Orbits

The second class of orbits is deﬁned by ¨φ = 0, so that the angular velocity is constant, say
˙φ = Ω. From eq. (30) we see that sin β = 0 and hence β = 0 for these orbits, which implies
that they are horizontal. Then eq. (31) gives the relation between the required angular
velocity Ω and the geometrical parameters of the orbit:

Ω2 =

g cot α

(2k + 1)r′ + ka cos α

=

g cot α

(2k + 1)r sin θ − (k + 1)a cos α

,

(40)

recalling eq. (4). Compare Ex. 3, sec. 244 of Routh [5] or sec. 407 of Milne [2]. There are
no steady horizontal orbits for which α = 0, i.e., for which the wheel lies in the plane of the
orbit. For such an orbit the angular momentum would be constant, but the torque on the
wheel would be nonzero in contradiction.

In the following we will ﬁnd that horizontal orbits are possible only for 0 < α < π/2.
First, the requirement that Ω2 > 0 for real orbits puts various restrictions on the param-

eters of the problem. We examine these for the four quadrants of angle α.

1. 0 < α < π/2. Then cot α > 0 so we must have

r′ > −

ka cos α
2k + 1

.

(41)

This is satisﬁed by all r′ > 0 and some r′ < 0. However, for the wheel to ﬁt inside the
sphere with 0 < α < π/2, we can have r′ < 0 only for θ > π/2 according to eqs. (3)
and (4).

2. π/2 < α < π. Then cos α < 0 and cot α < 0 so the numerator of (40) is negative and
the denominator is positive. Hence Ω is imaginary and there are no steady orbits in
this quadrant.

9

3. −π < α < −π/2. Then cos α < 0 but cot α > 0 so Ω2 > 0 and r′ > 0 and eq. (40)
imposes no to restriction. For the wheel to ﬁt inside the sphere with α in this quadrant
we must have θ < π/2.

4. −π/2 < α < 0. Then cot α < 0 so we must have
ka cos α
2k + 1

r′ < −

< 0.

(42)

For the wheel to be inside the sphere with r′ < 0 and α in this quadrant we must have
θ < π/2.

To obtain further restrictions on the parameters we examine under what conditions the
wheel remains in contact with the sphere. The contact force F is deduced from eqs. (7), (25)
and (29) to be

F/m = (−g cos α + r′Ω2 sin α)ˆ1 − (g sin α + r′Ω2 cos α)ˆ3.

(43)

It is more useful to express F in components along the ˆr and ˆθ axes where ˆr points away
from the center of the sphere and ˆθ points towards increasing θ. The two sets of axes are
related by a rotation about axis ˆ2:

ˆ1 = − cos(θ − α)ˆr + sin(θ − α)ˆθ,

ˆ3 = sin(θ − α)ˆr + cos(θ − α)ˆθ,

so that

F/m = −(r′Ω2 sin θ − g cos θ)ˆr − (r′Ω2 cos θ + g sin θ)ˆθ

= −r′Ω2ˆr′ + gˆz.

(44)

(45)

The second form of eq. (45) follows directly from elementary considerations. The inward
component of the contact force, F⊥ = −Fr, is positive and the orbits are physical provided
(46)

r′Ω2 > g cot θ.

There can be no orbits with r′ < 0 and θ < π/2, which rules out orbits in quadrant 4 of

α, i.e., for −π/2 > α < 0.
r′ > 0 only if

Using eq. (40) for Ω2 in eq. (46) we deduce that contact is maintained for orbits with

cot α > [2k + 1 + k(a/r′) cos α] cot θ.

(47)

For r′ < 0 the sign of the inequality is reversed.

In the third quadrant of α we have cos α < 0, so inequality (47) can be rewritten with

the aid of (4) as

cot α >  1 + 2k −

k

1 + r sin θ/a|cos α|! cot θ > cot θ.

However, in this quadrant inequality (3) tells us

cot α < cothθ + sin−1(a/r)i < cot θ.

10

(48)

(49)

Hence there can be no steady orbits with −π < α < −π/2.
Thus steady horizontal orbits are possible only for 0 < α < π/2. Furthermore, since the
factor in brackets of inequality (47) is roughly 2 for a wheel, this kinematic constraint is
somewhat stronger than the purely geometric relation (3). However, a large class of orbits
remains with θ < π/2 as well as θ > π/2.

The coeﬃcient of friction µ at the point of contact must be at least Fk/F⊥ where Fk = |Fθ|
from eq. (45). (For θ > π/2 and α near zero the tangential friction Fθ can sometimes point
in the +θ direction.) Hence we need

µ ≥ |r′Ω2 cos θ + g sin θ|
r′Ω2 sin θ − g cos θ

.

(50)

The acceleration of the center of mass of the wheel is r′Ω2, so according to eq. (40) the
corresponding number of g’s is

cot α

2k + 1 + k(a/r′) cos α

.

(51)

Table 1 lists parameters of several horizontal orbits for a sphere of size as might be found
in a motorcycle circus. The coeﬃcient of friction of rubber tires is of order one, so orbits
more than a few degrees above the equator involve very strong accelerations. The head of
the motorcycle rider is closer to the vertical axis of the sphere than is the center of the wheel,
so the number of g’s experienced by the rider is somewhat less than that given in the Table.

the plane of the orbit, for a/r = 0.1 as in Table 1.

curves, derived from expressions (3), (40) and (46).

From eq. (40) we see that α = π/2, Ω = 0 is a candidate “orbit” in the lower hemisphere.
On such an “orbit” the wheel is standing vertically at rest, and is not stable against falling
over. We infer that stability will only occur for Ω greater than some minimum value not
revealed by the analysis thus far.

2.3 Stability Analysis

A completely general analysis of the stability of the steady circular orbits found above appears
to be very diﬃcult. We give a fairly general analysis for vertical orbits, but for horizontal
orbits we obtain results only for orbits with θ = π/2, i.e., orbits about the equator of the
sphere, and for orbits of “small” wheels.

We follow the approach of sec. 405 of Milne [2] where it was shown how the steady motion
of a disk rolling in a straight line on a horizontal plane is stable if the angular velocity is
great enough. It was also shown that the small oscillatory departures from steady motion
lead to an oscillatory path of the point of contact of the wheel with the plane. Hence in the
present case we must consider perturbations that carry the wheel away from the plane of
the steady orbit.

The diﬃculty is that there are in general four degrees of freedom for departures from
steady motion: the axis of the wheel can be perturbed in two directions and the angular

velocity ˙φ can be perturbed as well as the angle θ to the point of contact. However, the
procedure to eliminate the unknown force of contact from the six equations of motion of a
rigid body leaves only three equations of motion. We will obtain solutions to the perturbed
equations of motions only in special cases where there are in eﬀect just two or three degrees
of freedom. A more general analysis might be possible using the contact force found in
steady motion as a ﬁrst approximation to the contact force in perturbed motion, but we do
not pursue this here.

A wheel rolling with a steady circular orbit on a plane can suﬀer only three types of
perturbations and the results of an analysis are reported in Ex. 3, sec. 244 of Routh [5]. For
a sphere rolling within a ﬁxed sphere the direction of what we call axis 3 always points to the
center of the ﬁxed sphere so there are only two perturbations to consider and the solution is
relatively straightforward, as reviewed in sec. 4 below. The stability of horizontal orbits of
rolling spheres lends conﬁdence that stable orbits also exist for wheels.

2.3.1 Vertical Orbits

We deﬁne the (x′, y′, z′) coordinate system to have the x′-axis vertical: ˆx′ = ˆz. In steady
motion we have

α = 0,

ˆ1 = −ˆz′,

and

ˆ3 = ˆr′ = ˆx′ cos φ + ˆy′ sin φ,

(52)

where φ is the azimuth of the center of the wheel from the ˆx′-axis. Thus φ = 0 at the top of
the orbit. To discuss departures from steady motion in which the ˆ1-axis is no longer parallel
to the ˆz′-axis, it is useful to have a unit triad (ˆr′, ˆs′, ˆz′) deﬁned by eq. (52) and

ˆs′ = ˆz′ × ˆr′ = −ˆx′ sin φ + ˆy′ cos φ,

(53)

with φ deﬁned as before. See Fig. 6. The surface of the sphere at the point of contact is
parallel to the s′-z′ plane. Axes ˆr′ and ˆz′ rotate about the z′-axis with angular velocity ˙φ,
so that

dˆr′
dt

= ˙φˆs′,

and

dˆs′
dt

= − ˙φˆr′.

The perturbed ˆ1-axis can then be written

ˆ1 = ǫrˆr′ + ǫsˆs′ − ˆz′,

with

|ǫr| ,|ǫs| ≪ 1,

where throughout the stability analysis we ignore second-order terms. Writing

ˆ3 = ˆr′ + δsˆs′ + δzˆz′,

with

|δs| ,|δz| ≪ 1,

the condition ˆ1 · ˆ3 = 0 requires that δz = ǫr. Then to ﬁrst order,

ˆ2 = ˆ3 × ˆ1 = −δsˆr′ + ˆs′ + ǫsˆz′.

We expect that vector ˆ2 will remain parallel to the surface of the sphere even for large
departure from steady motion, so ˆ2 must remain in the s′-z′ plane. Hence, δs = 0, and

ˆ3 = ˆr′ + ǫrˆz′.

Figure 6: For vertical orbits the x′-axis is identical with the z axis. The axis
ˆs′ = ˆz′ × ˆr′ is in the direction of the unperturbed ˆ2-axis.

Also, we can identify α as the tilt angle of the ˆ3-axis to the r′-s′ plane, so that

α = ǫr.

(59)

The analysis proceeds along the lines of sec. 2.1 except that now we express all vectors
in terms of the triad (ˆr′, ˆs′, ˆz′). To the ﬁrst approximation the angular velocity of the wheel
about the ˆ1-axis is still given by ω1 = (r′/a) ˙φ. From eqs. (54) and (55) we ﬁnd

ˆ3 × ˆz = (ˆr′ + ǫrˆz′) × (cos φˆr′ − sin φˆs′) = ǫr sin φˆr′ + ǫs cos φˆs′ − sin φˆz′.

The r′, s′ and z′ components of the equation of motion (9) are then

0 = [(2k + 1)r′ + ka]ǫr ¨φ + 2k(r′ + a) ˙ǫr ˙φ − gǫr sin φ − k(2r′ + a)ǫs ˙φ2 + ka¨ǫs,

(71)

If the perturbations ǫr, ǫs and ˙r′ are set to zero eqs. (69) and (70) become trivial while
eq. (71) becomes the steady equation of motion (33).

The general diﬃculty with this analysis is that there are only three equations, (69-71),
while there are four perturbations, ǫr, ǫs, ¨φ and ˙θ. The perturbation ˙θ appears only in
eq. (71) via ˙r′; its eﬀect on r′ leads only to second-order terms in eqs. (69-70). If we could
neglect the terms in ¨φ in eqs. (69-70) then these two equations would describe only the
perturbations ǫr and ǫs to ﬁrst order and a solution could be completed.

Therefore we restrict our attention to the top of the orbit, φ = 0, where eq. (71) tells
us that ¨φ = 0 to leading order. The angular velocity ˙φ0 at this point is a minimum so the
gyroscopic stability of the wheel is the least here. Hence if the orbit is stable at φ = 0 it will
be stable at all φ.

The forms of eqs. (69) and (70) for φ = 0 indicate that if ǫr and ǫs are oscillatory then

they are 90◦ out of phase. Therefore we seek solutions

ǫr = ǫr cos ωt,

ǫs = ǫs sin ωt,

(72)

where ω now represents the oscillation frequency. The coupled equations of motion then
yield the simultaneous linear equations

{(k + 1)aω2 + [(2k + 1)r′ + ka] ˙φ2

0 − g}ǫr + (2k + 1)(r′ + a) ˙φ0ωǫs = 0.

(73)

These equations are consistent only if the determinant of the coeﬃcient matrix vanishes,
which leads to the quadratic equation

B ± √B 2 + 4AC

Since A and B are positive there are real, positive roots whenever B 2 + 4AC is positive,

i.e., for C > −B 2/4A. In particular, this is satisﬁed for positive C, or equivalently for

(79)

However, this is less restrictive than the elementary result (37) that the wheel stay in contact
with the sphere! All vertical orbits for which the wheel remains in contact with the sphere
are stable against small perturbations.

The stability analysis yields the formal result that if (φ, ˙φ) = (0, 0) then ω = qg/(k + 1)a.

We recognize this as the frequency of oscillation of a simple pendulum formed by suspending
the wheel from a point on its rim, the motion being perpendicular to the plane of the wheel.

2.3.2 Horizontal Orbits

We expect the stability analysis of horizontal orbits to be nontrivial since we have identiﬁed
steady orbits that are “obviously” unstable.

The spirit of the analysis has been set forth in the preceding sections. For horizontal
orbits the (x′, y′, z′) coordinate system can be taken as identical with the (x, y, z) system, so
we drop symbol ′ in this section. We introduce a triad (ˆr, ˆs, ˆz) with ˆr being the perpendicular
unit vector from the z-axis toward the center of the wheel. Then ˆs points in the direction of
the motion of the center of the wheel in case of steady motion.

It is also useful to introduce a unit triad that points along the (ˆ1, ˆ2, ˆ3) axes for steady
motion. The ˆs axis already points along the ˆ2 axis for steady motion, so we only need deﬁne
ˆt as being along the direction of ˆ3, and ˆu as being along the direction of ˆ1 for steady motion,
as shown in Fig. 7. Then, (ˆs, ˆt, ˆu) form a right-handed unit triad. The vertical, ˆz, is then
related by

where α0 is the angle of inclination of the wheel to the horizontal in steady motion. The
triad (ˆs, ˆt, ˆu) rotates about the ˆz-axis with angular velocity ˙φ, so that

ˆz = − sin α0ˆt − cos α0 ˆu,

Figure 7: For horizontal orbits of a wheel rolling inside a sphere the (x, y, z)
axes are identical with the (x′, y′, z′) axes. The ˆr-ˆs plane is horizontal. The
axes ˆu, ˆs and ˆt are along the unperturbed directions of the ˆ1, ˆ2 and ˆ3 axes,
respectively. Axes ˆt and ˆu lie in the vertical plane ˆr-ˆz.

We now consider small departures from steady motion. The ˆ1-axis deviates slightly from

the ˆu-axis according to

(84)
The ˆ3-axis departs slightly from the t-axis, but to the ﬁrst approximation it remains in a
vertical plane, i.e., the t-u plane. Then we have

|ǫs| ,|ǫt| ≪ 1.

ˆ1 = ǫsˆs + ǫtˆt + ˆu,

ˆ2 = ˆs − ǫs ˆu,

and

ˆ3 = ˆt − ǫt ˆu.

With the above deﬁnitions the signs of angles α and ǫt are opposite:

∆α = −ǫt,

˙α = − ˙ǫt.

(96)

(97)

(98)

The leading terms of these three equations are just eqs. (30)-(32) for β = 0. Therefore we
can write ˙φ = Ω + ˙δ where Ω is the angular velocity of the steady horizontal orbit and δ is
a small correction.

Although the derivative of r′,

˙r′ = r ˙θ cos θ0 + a ˙α sin α0 = r ˙θ cos θ0 − a ˙ǫt sin α0,

(99)

appears only in eq. (98), in general the perturbation ˙θ is not decoupled from ǫs and ǫt as
was the case for vertical orbits. Thus far, we have found a way to proceed only in somewhat
special cases in which the θ perturbation can be ignored, as described in secs. 2.3.3 and 2.3.4.

2.3.3 Orbits Near the Equator

It appears possible to carry the analysis forward for the special case θ0 = π/2, the orbit on
the equator of the sphere. This case is, however, of interest.

Assuming θ0 = π/2 the equations of motion (96-98) then provide three relations among
the three perturbations δ, ǫs and ǫt. For this we consider only the ﬁrst-order terms, noting
that ˙φ2 ≈ Ω2 + 2Ω ˙δ and

r′ = r sin θ − a cos α ≈ r′

0 + r∆θ cos θ0 + a∆α sin α0 = r′

0 − aǫt sin α0,

(100)

where r0 = r − a cos α0 for θ0 = π/2, recalling eq. (86). Also, from the form of eqs. (96-98)
we infer that if the perturbations are oscillatory then δ and ǫs have the same phase which is
90◦ from that of ǫt. Therefore we seek solutions of the form

δ = δ sin ωt,

ǫs = ǫs sin ωt,

and

ǫt = ǫt cos ωt,

(101)

where ω is the frequency of oscillation. The ﬁrst-order terms of the diﬀerential equations
(96-98) then yield the algebraic relations

0 = 2Ω sin α0[(2k + 1)r′

0 + ka cos α0]ωδ − Ω(2k + 1)(r′

To have consistency the determinant of the coeﬃcient matrix must vanish, which leads
quickly to the quadratic equation

where

Aω4 − Bω2 − C = 0,

A = B13B22A31,

B = A11B22A33 + A12A23A31 + B13A21A32 − A13B22A31 − B13A22A31 − A12A21A33,
and

C = A11A22A33 + A13A21A32 − A13A22A31 − A11A23A32.

(104)

(105)

(106)

(107)

From numerical evaluation it appears that A, B and C are all positive for angular ve-
locities Ω that obey eq. (40). That is, all steady orbits at the equator of the sphere are
stable. There is both a fast and slow oscillation about steady motion for these orbits, an
eﬀect familiar from nutations of a symmetric top.

2.3.4 Small Wheel Inside a Large Sphere

The analysis can also be carried further in the approximation that the radius a of the wheel
is much less than the radius r of the ﬁxed sphere. In this case the perturbation in angle θ
of the orbit is of higher order than the perturbations in azimuth φ and in the angles ǫs and
ǫt related to the axes of the wheel. A solution describing the three ﬁrst-order perturbations
can then be obtained.

For the greatest simpliﬁcation we also require that

a ≪ r′

0 ≈ r sin θ0.

(108)

Thus we restrict our attention to orbits signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the special cases of motion
near the poles of the ﬁxed sphere.

In the present approximation the ﬁrst-order terms of the perturbed equations of motion

(96-98) are

and

¨δ = −ǫsΩ2 sin α0.

20

(109)

(110)

(111)

Inserting (110) into (111) we can integrate the latter to ﬁnd

˙δ = −Ωǫt.

Using this and the derivative of (110) in (109) we ﬁnd that ǫt obeys

¨ǫt +"Ω2 sin α0(cos α0 + 2 sin α0) +

g sin2 α0
(2k + 1)r′

0# ǫt = 0.

The the frequency ω of the perturbations is given by

g sin2 α0
(2k + 1)r′

0

= Ω2 tan α0(1 + sin 2α0),

(114)

using eqs. (40) and (108).

Thus all orbits for small wheels are stable if condition (108) holds. We conjecture that

orbits for large wheels are also stable if (108) is satisﬁed.

For steady orbits that lie very near the poles, i.e., those that have r′

0

that the motion is stable only for Ω greater than some minimum value. For a wheel spinning
about its axis on a horizontal plane the stability condition is

<∼ a, we conjecture

Ω2 >

g

(2k + 1)a

.

(115)

See, for example, sec. 55 of Deimel [4]. However, we have been unable to deduce the gener-
alization of this constraint to include the dependence on r and θ0 for small r sin θ0.

3 Wheel Rolling Outside a Fixed Sphere

Equations (1)-(32) hold for a wheel rolling outside a sphere as well as inside when the
geometric relation (3) is rewritten as

θ < α < π + θ.

(116)

We expect no vertical orbits as the wheel will lose contact with the sphere at some point.
To verify this, note that the condition sin α = 0 (from eq. (32)) implies that α = π when
the wheel is outside the sphere. Then eqs. (34-36) indicate, for example, that if the wheel
starts from rest at the top of the sphere it loses contact with the sphere when

cos φ =

2

3 + 2k

.

(117)

The result for a particle sliding on a sphere (k = 0) is well known.

For horizontal orbits, eqs. (40-45) are still valid, but the condition that friction have an

outward component is now

r′Ω2 < g cot θ,

(118)

21

and hence

cot α < (2k + 1 + k(a/r′) cos α) cot θ.

(119)

Equation (40) can be satisﬁed for α < π/2 so long at the radius of the wheel is small enough
that (2k + 1)r′ + ka cos α is positive. We must have θ < π/2 to have α < π/2 since α > θ, so
horizontal orbits exist on the upper hemisphere. A particular solution is α = π/2 for which
Ω = 0; this is clearly unstable.

There is a class of orbits with θ < π/2 and α very near π + θ that satisfy both eqs. (40)

and (119). These also appear to be unstable.

The stability analysis of the preceding section holds formally for wheels outside spheres,

but the restriction there to the case of θ = 90◦ provides no insight into the present case.

4 Sphere Rolling Inside a Fixed Sphere

The case of a sphere rolling on horizontal orbits inside a ﬁxed sphere has been treated by
Milne [2]. For completeness, we give an analysis for orbits of arbitrary inclination to compare
and contrast with the case of a wheel.

Again the axis normal to the orbit is called ˆz′, which makes angle β to the vertical ˆz. The
polar angle of the orbit about ˆz′ is θ and φ is the azimuth of the point of contact between
the two spheres. The radius of the ﬁxed sphere is r.

The diameter of the rolling sphere that passes through the point of contact must always
be normal to the ﬁxed sphere. That is, the “bank” angle of the rolling sphere is always
θ − π/2 with respect to the plane of the orbit.
The angular momentum is, of course,

The rolling sphere has radius a, mass m and moment of inertia kma2 about any diameter.

Lcm = kma2~ω,

(120)

where ~ω is the angular velocity of the rolling sphere.

We again introduce a right-handed triad of unit vectors (ˆ1, ˆ2, ˆ3) centered on the rolling
sphere. For consistency with the notation used for the wheel, axis ˆ3 is directed towards the
point of contact, axis ˆ2 is parallel to the plane of the orbit, and axis ˆ1 is in the ˆ3-ˆz′ plane,
as shown in Fig. 8. In general, none of these vectors are body vectors for the rolling sphere.
The center of mass of the rolling sphere lies on the line joining the center of the ﬁxed sphere
to the point of contact, and so

Equations (7-12) that govern the motion and describe the rolling constraint hold for the

sphere as well as the wheel. Using eqs. (120) and (121) we can write eq. (9) as

rcm = (r − a)ˆ3 ≡ r′ˆ3,

We seek an additional expression for the angular velocity ~ω of the rolling sphere, but we
cannot use eq. (13) since we have not identiﬁed a body axis in the sphere. However, with

on a circular orbit perpendicular to the ˆz′-axis inside a ﬁxed sphere. The ˆ3-
axis is along the line of centers of the two spheres, and passes through the
point of contact. The ˆ2-axis lies in the plane of the orbit along the direction
of motion of the center of the rolling sphere, and axis ˆ1 = ˆ2 × ˆ3 is in the ˆ3-ˆz′
plane.

We can now see that ω3 = ~ω · ˆ3 is a constant by noting that ˆ3 · d~ω/dt = 0 from eq. (122),
and also ~ω · dˆ3/dt = 0 from eq. (123). The freedom to chose the constant angular velocity
ω3 for a rolling sphere permits stable orbits above the equator of the ﬁxed sphere, just as
the freedom to adjust the bank angle α allows such orbits for a wheel.

Milne notes that this equation is identical to that for a symmetric top with one point ﬁxed
[2], and so the usual extensive analysis of nutations about the stable orbits follows if desired.

We again restrict ourselves to circular orbits, for which the angular velocity of the center

of mass, and of ˆ1, ˆ2 and ˆ3 is ˙φˆz′ where the z′-axis is ﬁxed. Then with

we have

d2ˆ3
dt2 = ˙φ2 sin θˆz′ × ˆ2 + ¨φ sin θˆ2 = − ˙φ2 sin θ cos θˆ1 + ¨φ sin θˆ2 + ˙φ2 sin2 θˆ3,

and hence,

d2ˆ3
dt2 = − ¨φ sin θˆ1 − ˙φ2 sin θ cos θˆ2.

With these the equation of motion (125) reads

(k + 1)r′ ¨φ sin θˆ1 + [(k + 1)r′ ˙φ2 cos θ + kaω3 ˙φ] sin θˆ2 = −gˆz × ˆ3.

We can use eq. (29) for ˆz × ˆ3 if we substitute α = θ − π/2 for the rolling sphere:

ˆz × ˆ3 = − sin β sin φˆ1 + (sin θ cos β − cos θ sin β cos φ)ˆ2.

The components of the equation of motion are then

(k + 1)r′ ¨φ sin θ = sin β sin φ,

[(k + 1)r′ ˙φ2 cos θ + kaω3 ˙φ] sin θ = g cos θ sin β cos φ − g sin θ cos β.

The two equations of motion are not consistent in general. To see this, take the derivative

of eq. (133) and substitute ¨φ from eq. (132):

kaω3 sin β sin φ = −3(k + 1)r′ ˙φ cos θ sin β sin φ.

(134)

While this is certainly true for β = 0 (horizontal orbits), for nonzero β we must have ˙φ cos θ
constant since ω3 is constant. Equation (134) is satisﬁed for θ = π/2 (great circles), but for
arbitrary θ we would need ˙φ constant which is inconsistent with eq. (132). Further, on a
great circle eq. (133) becomes kaω3 ˙φ = −g cos β. This is inconsistent with eq. (132) unless
β = π/2 (vertical great circles) and ω3 = 0.
In summary, the only possible closed orbits for a sphere rolling within a ﬁxed sphere are

horizontal circles and vertical great circles.

We remark further only on the horizontal orbits. For these ˙φ ≡ Ω is constant according

to eq. (132). Equation (133) then yields a quadratic equation for Ω:

(k + 1)r′Ω2 cos θ + kaω3Ω + g = 0,

so that there are orbits with real values of Ω provided

(kaω3)2 ≥ 4(k + 1)gr′ cos θ.

24

(135)

(136)

This is satisﬁed for orbits below the equator (θ > π/2) for any value of the “spin” ω3 of the
sphere (including zero), but places a lower limit on |ω3| for orbits above the equator. For the
orbit on the equator we must have Ω = −g/(kaω3) so a nonzero ω3 is required here as well.

The contact force F is given by

F/m = (g + r′Ω2 cos θ) sin θˆ1 − (r′Ω2 sin2 θ − g cos θ)ˆ3,

(137)

using eqs. (7) and (134). For the rolling sphere to remain in contact with the ﬁxed sphere
there must be a positive component of F pointing toward the center of the ﬁxed sphere.
Since axis ˆ3 is radial outward from the ﬁxed sphere, we require that F3 be negative, and
hence

r′Ω2 sin2 θ > g cos θ.

(138)

This is always satisﬁed for orbits below the equator. For orbits well above the equator this
requires a larger value of |ω3| than does eq. (136). To see this, suppose ω3 is exactly at the
minimum value allowed by eq. (136), which implies that Ω = −kaω3/(2(k + 1)r′ cos θ). Then
eq. (138) requires that tan2 θ > k + 1. So for k = 2/5 and at angles θ < 50◦ larger values of
|ω3| are needed to satisfy eq. (136) than to satisfy eq. (136). However, there are horizontal
orbits at any θ > 0 for |ω3| large enough.

5 Sphere Rolling Outside a Fixed Sphere

This case has also been treated by Milne [2]. A popular example is spinning a basketball on
one’s ﬁngertip.

Equations eq. (135) and (136) hold with the substitution that r′ = r + a. The condition

on the contact force becomes

r′Ω2 sin2 θ < g cos θ,

(139)
which can only be satisﬁed for θ < π/2. While eq. (136) requires a large spin |ω3|, if it is
too large eq. (139) can no longer be satisﬁed in view of the relation (135). For any case in
which the orbit exists a perturbation analysis shows that the motion is stable against small
nutations [2].

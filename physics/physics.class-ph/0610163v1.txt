Green’s Function for Flexural Impulse Response

Richard B¨ussow∗

Einsteinufer 25, 10587 Berlin

Richard B¨ussow†

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

This work addresses the Green’s functions for inﬁnite beams and plates with a force excitation
at the origin of the coordinate system. The Green’s function for beams is derived and for plates
revisited. The Green’s function is used in a numerical experiment to calculate the response of an
time reversed impulse.
The impulse response is measured in an experiment and compared with that predicted by theory.

I. INTRODUCTION

Fourier transform is

This mainly analytical work is a starting point for
the analysis of the time - frequency distribution of a
bending wave impulse response. The analysis of gen-
eral dispersive waves can be found for example in recent
publications1,2,3. Here only the simple Euler - Bernoulli
bending theory is used. This has the advantage that a an-
alytical solution can be studied. In case of inﬁnite plates
and a impulse force excitation at the coordinate systems
origin the solution can be found in textbooks4. For the
deﬂection of the plate it is ﬁrst derived by Boussinesq5.
In case of inﬁnite beams also Boussinesq5 announced in
the 19th century a solution to a similar problem of a ini-
tial deﬂection. A search in old scientiﬁc documents did
not reveal a reference for the Green’s function of inﬁnite
beams with a impulse force excitation at the origin. This
function is derived.
The functions are discussed with respect to energy con-
siderations and the mobility, which may provide inter-
esting insights since it highlights well known phenomena
from a diﬀerent point of view.

II. GREEN’S FUNCTIONS

A. Semi-Inﬁnite and Inﬁnite Beam

Consider a theoretical setup of a semi-inﬁnite (x

∈
]) or inﬁnite beam, which is excited at x = 0 with
[0,
an arbitrarily short force impulse Fa. The impulse is
modelled by the Dirac δ-function Fa(t) = F0 δ(t) whose

where H(T ) is the Heaviside-Function. To ﬁnd the
Green’s function for the impulse response of the beam
one may proceed with the boundary conditions for this
elementary problem. The equations for the angular ve-
locity w, bending moment M , shear force Fy and velocity
v of a beam which can be modelled with the Euler beam
theory are4

B. Boundary Conditions

For a semi-inﬁnite beam the waves propagate away

from the excitation point which leeds to4

kbx.

(3)

Herein the term ˆv+ is the amplitude of the propagating,
far-ﬁeld wave and ˆv+j of evanescent near-ﬁeld wave. At
the free end the bending moment and shear force must
vanish F (x = 0) = Fa and M (x = 0) = 0. It follows with
1 + j = √2j that

ˆv(x, ω) =

real part of the inverse Fourier transform of equation (4)

It is not obvious how to incorporate the given initial con-
ditions of a force impulse into the function V (t), but
nevertheless one may recognise the similar structure of
the results.
In case of an arbitrary force Fa(t), Im
= 0 does
not hold. Usually there will be some dependence on ω.
Therefore the whole equation (9) seems only to be use-
ful, if the Fourier transfom of the force is known and one
builds the resulting velocity by convolution. The Fourier

It should be mentioned that to produce this result it is

the beam:

D. Dispersion number

An important diﬀerence between the bending wave
and, for example, a longitudinal wave is that the group
velocity is frequency dependent. It can be quantiﬁed with
the term

Di =

,

(19)

called dispersions number. The dispersion number is a
measure of the spreading of the diﬀerent spectral frac-
tions of the impulse.

v(ω, t) =

content of the bending wave is travelling with its partic-
ular group velocity.

One may interpret equation (20) so, that the impulse
p
while traveling through the beam is scaled by the travel
time in a way that the energy of the impulse is conserved.
In the case of a plate the corresponding term is 1
t , which
is due to the fact that the impulse propagates on a ring
and not a point.

F. Time reversal

To generate a deﬁned impulse at a certain distance
from the point excitation one may develop the time re-
versal from equation (10). As an example a impulse is
requested at a position x on a structur. By considering
the force

(22)
a pulse resembling a δ-function can be realized. The
generated impulse will not be a perfect δ-impulse that
consists of the whole frequency spectrum, but will be a
band-ﬁltered version. The frequency range is given by

fmax/min =

x2

8ζπt2

min/max

.

(23)

In a numerical experiment the velocity is calculated with
equation (14) and shown in ﬁgure 1. This is a theoretical
example for the time reversal technique6,7.

FIG. 1. Velocity of a beam excited with a reciprocal impulse
deﬁned in equation (22), c = 1, x = 2. The intensity is |v|.

G. Mobility

The complex mobility is the reciprocal of the mechan-

ical impedance Z and deﬁned by

ˆY = 1/ ˆZ = ˆv/ ˆFa.

(24)

(21)

If the velocity and the force are not at the same position
it is called transfer mobility. For a semi-inﬁnite beam the
1)
transfer mobility to a position in the far-ﬁeld (kbx
is obtained as

ˆY (ω) =

The Fourier transform of equation (27) produces with
F T
π/ω exactly the same mobility as equa-
tion (26). This indicates that the remaining cosine-term
in equation (10) is not eﬀecting the magnitude of the mo-
bility in the far-ﬁeld. With equation (23) follows that
the far-ﬁeld condition (kbx
1) for equation (10) is
1. With this prerequisite follows that the power
Di/t
of the cosine-term is 1/2 just like a cosine of a ﬁxed fre-
quency.

III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Measurements are carried out on a thin acrylic plate
and a slender aluminum beam in diﬀerent distances and
conﬁgurations. The results show the same tendency. For
the sake of brevity just one typical measurement of the
plate and the beam is presented and discussed.

A. Plate

The dimensions of the plate are a height of d = 2mm, a
length of l = 2.05m and a width of b = 1.52m. The mate-
rial parameters provided by the manufacturer are elastic
modulus E = 3.3GP a, ρ = 1190kg/m3 and a Poisson’s
ratio ν = 0.37.
The whole plate is suspend in a frame. The velocity is
measured with a laser-vibrometer with a sampling fre-
quency of 48kHz placed at least 0.5m from the frame.
The plate is excited by means of a impacting hammer
equipped with a force transducer. The excitation point
is 0.5m from the response position.
Since the real plate is not inﬁnite only the ﬁrst passage of
the impulse is considered. The plate velocity is plotted
in ﬁgure 2. The time axis is started at the maximum of
the force signal minus the delay of the laser-vibrometer of
1.1ms. The theoretical curve is calculated with equation
(18) a value of Di = 0.0544. The actual value is extracted
with a method that is discussed in a companion publi-
cation. The frequency range of the theoretical curve is
fmin = 180Hz to fmax = 5.2kHz. The measured curve
is corrected by means of the frequency distribution of the
theoretical curve that is obtained from equation (23) and
the power spectrum of the measured force impulse. The
curves are normalised with their maximum value, since in
this context the distribution of amplitude and frequency
over time is of interest, but not the absolut value.

B. Beam

The dimensions of the beam are a diameter of d =
3mm, a length of l = 3m. Typical material parameters
for aluminum are elastic modulus E = 72GP a and den-
sity ρ = 2700kg/m3.
The beam is clamped at both ends and pre-stressed to
reduce the sagging. The velocity is measured with a laser-
vibrometer with a sampling frequency of 48kHz placed
at 0.5m from the end. The beam is excited in a distance
of 1.38m from the point of measurement. The velocity
in ﬁgure 3 is obtained in almost the same manner as in

the plate experiment. One may recognise that already
after 3ms the reﬂections from the clamped end are vis-
ible. The theoretical curve is calculated with equation
(10) at a value of Di = 0.079. The frequency range of
the theoretical curve is fmin = 124Hz to fmax = 5.4kHz.
There is a considerable diﬀerence between the dispersion
number of Di = 0.12 that is obtained with equation (19)
and the value used for the theoretical curve. The author
believes that the diﬀerence is due to the pre-stress. In a
experiment with a free end the agreement is good. Never-
theless this measurement is not presented, since the curve
is not as clear since the whole setup is rather unstable.

IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Green’s functions for a beam and a plate with a force
excitation at the origin of the coordinate system can be
used not only to calculate the response of a impulse but
also of general functions. The knowledge of this function
is important for the theorectical analysation of the time
- frequency behaviour. The good agreement of the theo-
retical and measured curve in ﬁgure 2 and ﬁgure 3 are a
experimental validation of the Green’s function.

Abstract

The spin-statistics connection is obtained for a simple formulation of a classical ﬁeld theory

containing even and odd Grassmann variables. To that end, irreducible canonical realizations of the

rotation group corresponding to general causal ﬁelds are constructed. The connection is obtained

by imposing local commutativity on the ﬁelds and exploiting the parity operation to exchange

spatial coordinates in the scalar product of classical ﬁeld evaluated at one spatial location with the

same ﬁeld evaluated at a distinct location. The spin-statistics connection for irreducible canonical

realizations of the Poincar´e group of spin j is obtained in the form: Classical ﬁelds and their

conjugate momenta satisfy fundamental ﬁeld-theoretic Poisson bracket relations for 2j even, and

fundamental Poisson antibracket relations for 2j odd.

INTRODUCTION

Few would dispute that the ﬁeld concept has been one of the happiest conceptual inno-

vations in the history of physics. From its nineteenth-century origins in the work of Faraday

and Maxwell, to modern theories of ﬂuid physics, the classical theory of elastic solids, rela-

tivistic gravitation, or of quantum ﬁeld theory, the notion of a physical quantity which takes

on values throughout a plenum has proven to be protean and endlessly fruitful. Consider

the success of the very prototype of a ﬁeld theory, classical electrodynamics, in describing

the propagation of electromagnetic radiation, of its identiﬁcation with light, and the trans-

port of electromagnetic energy by the Poynting vector. Imagine the diﬃculty of describing

these phenomena without the aid of electromagnetic ﬁelds. Nor is the future development of

quantum-mechanical descriptions of nature likely to abandon the ﬁeld concept: Whatever

form a ﬁnal theory of physics takes, whether cast in terms strings or branes, or other entities,

”eﬀective” quantum ﬁeld theories valid at low energies-the deﬁnition of ”low” varying, as

occasion demands-will remain indispensible aids to practical calculation.

This paper presents a proof of the connection between spin and statistics for classi-

cal Grassmann ﬁelds. An earlier paper1 presented a classical analog of the spin-statistics

connection for psuedomechanics, a version of analytical dynamics containing even and odd

Grassmann variables.2,3,4,5,6,7 The method of proof relies on the canonical formalism for ﬁelds,

suitably extended to include odd Grassmann variables. Classical ﬁeld theory is readily cast

in terms of the canonical formalism,8,9,10 most familiarly as part of many an introductory

account of quantum ﬁeld theory.11,12 (But see Refs. 13,14 for a diﬀerent account of the foun-

dations of quantum ﬁeld theory.) The literature on canonical formulations of classical ﬁeld

theory, studied in their own right, is too large and various for a capsule summary. A sampler

of this body of research may be gleaned from reviews in Refs. 15,16,17,18. On the other

hand, apart from investigations inspired by supersymmetry,19,20 canonical treatments of odd

Grassman ﬁelds do not appear to be common. An example is the canonical treatment of

odd Grassmann ﬁelds in the paper by Gozzi et al.21.

We begin by extending the canonical formalism for ﬁelds to classical Grassmann vari-

ables. The classical equivalent of fermionic exchange symmetry appears in the properties

of anticommuting Grassmann variables. The construction of irreducible canonical realiza-

tions for massive ﬁelds possessing deﬁnite intrinsic spin, starting from the Lie algebra of the

2

Poincar´e group, is outlined next. Irreducible canonical realizations of the Poincar´e group are

classiﬁed in the same manner as irreducible unitary represenations in quantum ﬁeld theory.

Canonical equivalents for the elements of the theory of unitary representations in a Hilbert

space, including ladder and Casimir operators, are presented. Of particular importance for
the present problem, the canonical space inversion (or parity) operation ˆP and its action

are deﬁned. Finally, the spin-statistics connection is obtained by using the parity operation

to exchange spatial coordinates in the scalar product of a ﬁeld evaluated at one spacetime

location with the same ﬁeld, evaluated at a distinct spacetime location lying at spacelike

interval from the ﬁrst.

Local Poincar´e symmetry contributes two elements to the proof: (1) The properties of the

rotational subgroup, speciﬁcally the properties of irreducible canonical realizations of spin

degrees of freedom, and (2) the action of the discrete symmetry of parity transformation
ˆP . As in other proofs of the spin-statistics connection, invocation of Poincar´e symmetry

furnishes a suﬃcient condition for the condition, but its necessity is by no means obvious.

The point receives further attention in Section VI.

Lower case Greek letters denote either even or odd Grassmann ﬁelds, unless otherwise

indicated in the text. When it is desirable to distinguish even ﬁelds, they will be labelled by

lower case Latin letters. Lower case Latin letters are also used for coordinates of spacetime

locations; x

(x, t) distinguishes space and time coordinates once a spacelike foliation

≡

has been established. Except when serving for spin degrees of freedom, lower case Greek

indices run from 0 to 3, while lower case Latin indices run from 1 to 3. The Minkowski

metric has spacelike signature g = diag(

1, 1, 1, 1). The summation convention applies to

repeated indices, unless the summation sign is explicity shown for emphasis. When required

for notational compactness, the partial derivative of ψα with respect to xµ is written

II. CLASSICAL GRASSMANN FIELDS

The commutation properties of Grassmann variables permit the realization of ferminonic

and bosonic exhchange symmetry in a classical setting.1,22,23 The familiar c-number bosonic

variables of traditional classical physics are even Grassmann variables. Odd classical Grass-

mann variables anticommute in a form of the exclusion principle. A set of n odd real

It follows that

ξ2
µ(x) = 0.

Even and odd variables, in either order, commute. The functional dependence of a ﬁeld ξx

on position will not always be explicitly shown.

Diﬀerentiation on Grassmann variables can act from the right or the left. The sign of

the derivative of a product, for example, can depend on which derivative is taken. Left

diﬀerentiation, in accord with the convention in Ref. 22, is used exclusively in the following.

The formalism for analytical dynamics of Grassmann variables, developed by Casalbuoni,

Pauri, Prosperi, and Loinger, that found use in Ref. 1, can largely be translated directly

into ﬁeld-theoretic language.9,10,17,24 Canonical transformations, for example, are deﬁned in a

manner that corresponds closely to analytical dynamics, as automorphisms of the ﬁelds that

preserve Poisson brackets. The necessary alterations to the deﬁnition of Poisson brackets for

ﬁelds are given below. The discussion will be limited to unconstrained systems for simplicity.

Fields are assumed to be ”massive,” so that it makes sense to speak of a rest frame

for them, i. e., a frame in which the spatial components of the four-momentum density

vanish.25 The support of the ﬁelds is taken to be a large region of Minkowski spacetime R

with boundary ∂R on which normal gradients of the ﬁelds vanish. Let qi(xµ), i = 1, m, be
even ﬁeld variables, and ξα(xµ), α = 1, n, be odd ﬁeld variables. Given a Lagrangian

Casalbuoni2 has shown that the set of Poisson brackets and antibrackets in pseudome-

construction in terms of ﬁeld-theoretic brackets. Let ςf = 0 for an even ﬁeld and ςφ = 1 for

odd. The corresponding generalization of the Jacobi identity,2,3,26,27,28

6

in psuedomechanics, its validity for classical ﬁelds follows from results obtained by Kuper-

shmidt in a treatment of classical ﬁelds possessing Hamiltonian structure, using a geometric

formulation of the calculus of variations.19,20,24 Jacobi identities for classical ﬁelds are not

guaranteed to vanish under all circumstances. However, the identities do vanish modulo a

divergence term, whose contribution in the present discussion vanishes upon integration by

parts, by virtue of the assumption made earlier that all gradients vanish on δR.

IRREDUCIBLE CANONICAL REALIZATIONS OF THE POINCAR´E

The classical model of a ﬁeld used in this paper is the canonical ﬁeld-theoretic counter-

part of an irreducible representation of the Poincar´e group used to describe a particle in

quantum ﬁeld theory.31,32 Instead of commutation relations amongst matrix generators of

inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformations and rotations, one manipulates Poisson brackets re-

lating inﬁnitesimal generators of canonical transformations. Likewise, a functional on phase

space which depends solely upon the generators of the Lie algebra and which is an invari-

ant in all realizations of the Lie group is called a Casimir invariant, or simply a Casimir.

Casimirs serve as the canonical equivalents of quantum-mechanical Casimir operators.

Pauri and Prosperi33 developed the theory of canonical realizations of Lie groups, and

later presented the canonical realization of the Poincar´e group in detail.34 (Vide. also

Ref. 35.) Ref. 1 gives the extension of that analysis to canonical realizations in psuedome-

chanics. Both the deﬁnition of dynamical quantites and of their Poisson brackets in classical

ﬁeld theory diﬀer from those in psuedomechanics. However, the preceding section showed

that classical ﬁelds of the simple kind considered in this paper satisfy Poisson bracket re-

lations identical to those for generalized coordinates and momenta in psuedomechanics.

Insofar as the development in Ref. 34 depends only on algebraic relations of generators of

canonical transformations and Poisson brackets, the results of that analysis can be taken

over immediately to the corresponding ﬁeld-theoretic results.

A. The Poincar´e group

The realization of the Poincar´e group as a set of canonical transformations is presented

in Ref. 1, and is sketched here in summary form. The eﬀect of a general inhomogeneous

Lorentz transformation (Λ, a) on a four-vector xµ is

x′µ = Λµ

αxα + aµ.

If such a transformation is given a unitary representation (of any tensorial degree), the

matrices D of the representation satisfy

D(Λ2, a2)D(Λ1, a1) = D(Λ2Λ1, a2 + Λ2a1).

group.32,35,36,37 In classical ﬁeld theory, as in quantum ﬁeld theory, one may exploit the ma-

trix representation directly, or one may regard the commutation relations of the generators

as determining Lie bracket relations for an ”abstract” representation of the Poincar´e group.

We follow the latter path here, and obtain a canonical realization by replacing Lie brackets

with Poisson brackets for the generators M and P of inﬁnitesimal canonical transformations

corresponding to

and

, as described in Ref. 1. (As in psuedomechanics, a canonical

M

P

realization of the Poincar´e group is a faithful one, i.e., there are no nontrivial neutral ele-

ments. The bracket relations of the canonical realization are thus identical to those of the

Lie algebra.)

The ten generators of inﬁnitesimal canonical transformations for the Poincar´e group can

be sorted into one temporal translation, three spatial translations, three boosts, and three

rotations.32,34,35,37 Of these, only the bracket relations for the generators of rotational canon-

The Pauli-Lubanski vector is a Casimir. In any frame in which the momentum p vanishes,

Eq. (43) becomes S, where the intrinsic spin S of the ﬁeld obeys

[Si, Sj]− = ǫijkSk

(44)

B. Angular momentum and irreducible canonical realizations

The behavior under rotations of a ﬁeld that transforms as an irreducible canonical realiza-

tion with a deﬁnite angular momentum closely resembles that of a corresponding quantum-

mechanical system. Canonical angular momentum variables satisfy bracket relations that

form a subgroup of the Poincar´e group decoupled from the boost degrees of freedom. As

a result, the spin degrees of freedom of a massive ﬁeld in its rest frame are treated in the

same way as in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. Loinger39 has shown that a canonical

variable which is rotationally invariant about an axis z obeys the bracket relation

One may regard this relation as a kind of eigenvector condition. The angular momentum

C. Classiﬁcation of Irreducible Realizations of the Poincar´e Group

Irreducible canonical realizations of the Poincar´e group may be classiﬁed in a manner

entirely analogous to the method used in quantum ﬁeld theory. Construct inﬁnitesmal

generators from the quantities deﬁned in Eq. (39)

Note that the ﬁrst two of these are identical to the Poisson brackets for Ji. The ladder

operator formalism developed in the preceding section therefore may be used to generate the

components of an irreducible canonical realization in exactly the same way that a complete

set of m-values is generated for spin j. The irreducible canonical realizations are classiﬁed

by a pair of indices (a, b), both of which may be either integral or half-integral. Generators

Canonical realizations with a deﬁnite spin j are constructed from combinations of the

(a, b) realizations. Thus, for example, a scalar ﬁeld belongs to the (0, 0) irreducible realiza-

tion, while the Dirac ﬁeld belongs to the ( 1

spans a (2a + 1)(2b + 1) subspace of the Hilbert space of irreducible canonical realizations.

A. Canonical realizations of the parity operation

The preceding Section treated the eﬀect of continuous coordinate transformations upon

classical Grassmann ﬁelds required for the proof of the spin-statistics connection. A complete

realization of the Poincar´e group also includes the discrete transformations of parity, time

reversal, and charge conjugation. The actions of parity and time reversal on a scalar function

ξ of spacetime location x, t are given by

The full Poincar´e group thus comprises four continuous components related by the various

combinations of the parity and time-reversal transformations. The classical analog of charge

conjugation is discussed in Ref. 1.

commutes with the generators of time translations and rotations, but anticommutes

with the generators of spatial translations and boosts. Pauri and Prosperi34 show that the
operator ˆP that realizes

in a canonical realization of the Poincar´e group has the action

P

on the generator of inﬁnitesimal canonical transformations for rotations and boosts, respec-
tively. In particular, the action of ˆP is diagonal on components of a ﬁeld of deﬁnite spin in

a spherical tensor basis:

In quantum mechanics, the parity of a state is a multiplicative quantum number. We

shall see that the parity eigenvalue of the scalar product of two classical ﬁelds is the product

of the parities of the individual ﬁelds.

Start with the observation that a scalar function of position has even parity under space

inversion. A scalar is unchanged by any transformation of reference frame.44 If one expresses
a scalar ﬁeld ξ(r) in terms of a new coordinate frame r′′ as ξ′′(r′′),45

Fix a common origin for both r and r′′, assumed to diﬀer from r by a rotation deﬁned by a

set of Euler angles collectively labeled Ω. Denote the action of the rotation that carries r
to r′′ by the rotation operator D1(Ω) and that which carries ξ to ξ′′ by D0(Ω):

The rotation operator D0(Ω) for a scalar is simply unity. By Eq. (72) we thus have

for any rotation Ω. Once an origin has been ﬁxed, the value of ξ does not depend upon the

orientation of the coordinate axes. Accordingly, ξ can depend only upon the magnitude of

and

r:

In particular,

The parity of a scalar ﬁeld is thus η = +1.

Next, the scalar product of two ﬁelds with the same rank is given by46

ξ′′(r′′) = ξ(r).

r′′ = D1(Ω)r

ξ′′ = D0(Ω)ξ.

ξ(D1(Ω)r) = ξ(r)

ξ(r) = ξ(

B. Parity and general canonical realizations of the Poincar´e group

Consider next the eﬀect of space inversion on the generators A and B of Eqs. (52) and

(53). Recall from Eqs. (66) and (67) that under the parity operation the generator of

rotations is even, and that of boosts is odd, with the result

ˆP (A) = B ˆP (B) = A

Apply the parity operation to Eq. (59):

V. CONNECTION BETWEEN SPIN AND STATISTICS

The central element of the proof relies on the scalar product of a ﬁeld evaluated at one

spacetime location with the same ﬁeld, evaluated at a point lying at spacelike interval from

the ﬁrst. A Lorentz frame exists in which the two points occur at equal time. The ﬁelds

may therefore be written as ξ(y, t) and ξ(y+x, t), and the scalar product as

By translational invariance, this must be identical with

ξ(y, t)

ξ(y+x, t)

·

which we write as

ξ(0, t)

ξ(x, t) = ξ(-x/2, t)

ξ(x/2, t)

ξ(-x, t)

ξ(x, t)

from here on. While this object can be regarded as a purely formal device, it is closely

related to a quantity which ﬁnds use elsewhere is classical physics, the correlation function.

The spatial autocorrelation of ξ

g(x, t) =

ξ(y, t)ξ(y+x, t)

h

i

is of great signiﬁcance in theories of statistical ﬂuctuations50,51 The angle brackets denote

a spatial average over y. While correlation functions ﬁnd more use in classical statistical

mechanics, where they are used to describe the relation between ﬂuctuations in particle

occupation number at distinct points in (say) an ideal gas, correlation functions appear

in continuum physics as well, most notably in the theory of interference of electromag-

netic ﬁelds,52,53 but also in descriptions of phenomena as diverse as intensity interferometry

in radio and optical astronomy,54 pressure ﬂuctuations in ﬂuid mechanics,55, ﬂuctuation-

dissipation relations in acoustics and electromagnetism,56,57 and critical opalescence.58

Commence by disposing of the possibility that the quantity

ξ(x, t)

might vanish identically for nontrivial ﬁelds. Recall from Eq. (78) that the product in

Eq. (103) is given by

at any given value of x, t may be thought of as a set of coeﬃcients in the linear combination

But each of the ξ−m is a linearly independent element of the spin j irreducible canonical

linear combination such as Eq. (107) can vanish iﬀ all its coeﬃecients am vanish, or

ξm(x, t) = 0

x, t) is, according to Eq. (96) for

where m = k + l, and the objects in parentheses are Wigner 3j symbols. It is readily shown

that Eqs. (81) and (82) are valid for the generalized scalar product, and that Eq. (117)
vanishes iﬀ ξ(x, t) does. By Eq. (96) for the (0,0) realization, the result of applying ˆP to

Eq. (117) once again gives Eq. (110). Both the spin j and summation index m are half-

integral iﬀ one of a and b is half-integral. Therefore, Eq. (115), and thus Eq. (116), hold for

the general (a, b) realization, as well.

We conclude classical ﬁelds which are irreducible canonical realizations of spin j must be

commuting, even Grassmann variables if j is an integer, and anticommuting, odd Grassmann

19

variables if j is half-integral. From the symmetry properties of brackets given earlier follows

immediately the conclusion that irreducible canonical realizations for integral j obey Poisson

bracket relations, while realizations for half-integral j obey Poisson antibracket relations. If

πµ is the momentum conjugate to ξµ, then the brackets are:

[ξµ(t, x), ξν(t, y)]− = [πµ(t, x), πν(t, y)]− = 0

VI. COMMENTS

The result just proven might appear to be in the nature of a curiosity. For one thing,

ﬁelds in classical physics are generally constrained systems.24 For another, if we except the

special cases of the electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds, problems in classical physics

involving canonical realizations of a deﬁnite, but otherwise arbitrary, value of dimensionless

angular momentum should be uncommon. A better statement of the connection might be:

Fields described by tensorial canonical realizations satisfy fundamental Poisson bracket rela-

tions, while ﬁelds described by spinorial realizations satisfy fundamental Poisson antibracket

relations.

Such attention as classical Grassmann ﬁelds have attracted so far appears to have been

directed more towards quantization of the classical theories than towards exploring their

physical content. It is, however, possible that classical odd Grassmann ﬁelds might well have

applications that have so far gone largely unexplored. The Hamiltonian formalism has been

extended to a variety of physical systems.59,60,61 Variational, and Hamiltonian, treatments of

ﬂuid mechanics have been the subject of numerous investigations over the years, vide. early

papers by Herivel62 and Eckart,63 and continuing with Seliger and Whitham,64 and Grifka,65

20

among others. Extensive literature reviews may be found in Refs. 17,18. A Hamiltonian

treatment of elastic media is given in Ref. 66. It may be that the mechanics of ﬂuids, elastic

media, or other systems described by odd Grassmann ﬁelds would repay study.

While the approach taken in this paper is Poincar´e-invariant, the treatment is not man-

ifestly covariant, in that it singles out spacelike slices. This diﬃculty is a familiar one in

Hamiltonian treatments of problems with relativistic symmetry. It was suggested in Ref. 1

that the existence of a classical spin-statistics relation allows one to regard the spin-statistics

connection as principally a relativistic phenonemon, and one motivation for the work pre-

sented here is to extend this idea. Notwithstanding that view of the matter (which is in

nowise obligatory), the method of proof used in this paper can be cast in nonrelativistic

terms without major change. The main diﬃculty would appear to be replicating the classiﬁ-

cation of irreducible realizations for general ﬁelds. For the special case of the classiﬁcation of

bound states of the hydrogen atom, it is possible to recapitulate the construction in Section

III C in nonrelativistic terms by substituting the Lenz vector for the boost generator K,67

but this method is not available in general. It hardly seems necessary, however, to replicate

every detail of the structure of irreducible realizations of the Poincar´e group in a nonrela-

tivistic treatment, so long as the rotation group is realized faithfully. The distinguished role

of spacelike slices in the canonical formalism naturally poses no diﬃculty in a nonrelativistic

setting.

VII. CONCLUSION

Simple arguments based upon a ﬁeld-theoretical canonical treatment of rotational and

space-inversion symmetry lead to a proof of the spin-statistics connection for classical Grass-

man ﬁelds which are irreducible canonical realizations of the Poincar´e group.

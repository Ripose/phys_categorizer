Abstract

We have previously discussed the classical diﬀusive system of the bounded one-dimensional mul-

titrap using the transfer-matrix method which is generally applied for studying the energy spectrum

of the unbounded quantum Kronig-Penney multibarrier. It was shown, by this method, that for

certain values of the relevant parameters the bounded multitrap array have unity transmission and

a double-peak phase transitional behaviour. We discuss in this work, using the same transfer matrix

method, the energy related to the diﬀusion through the unbounded one-dimensional multitrap and

ﬁnd that it may be expressed in two entirely diﬀerent ways with diﬀerent results and consequences.

Also, it is shown that, unlike the barriers in the Kronig-Penney case, the energies at one face of

the imperfect trap greatly diﬀer from the energies at the other face of the same trap.

INTRODUCTION

The remarkable similarity [1, 2] between the Schroedinger and the classical diﬀusion

equations have attracted many authors to discuss diﬀusion limited reactions using quan-

tum methods and terminology (see annotated bibliography in [1]). For example, the same

methods and teminology of transfer matrices [3, 4, 5], which are applied [3, 4] for discussing

quantum multibarrier potentials, have been used [6, 7] for discussing the one-dimensional

bounded imperfect multitrap system [8, 9, 10, 11] through which classical particles diﬀuse.

The imperfect trap, which was introduced in [12] and further discussed by others [13,

14, 15], may serve as a model for many physical situations. For example, one may ﬁnd

applications of it to rotational diﬀusion in chemical reactions [16] or to proteins with active

sites deep inside the protein matrix [17] or to inﬁnite lattice traversed by a random walker

in the presence of an imperfect trap [13]. We note that the discussion of the bounded one-

dimensional multitrap systems have resulted, for certain values of its parameters [6, 7], in

ﬁnding somewhat unconventional results. Among these one may count a unity transmission

of the density of the diﬀusing particles through the multitrap array [6] or the double-peak

phase transition recently found [7] in such systems.

An important aspect of the classical one-dimensional multitrap system which was not

fully discussed thus far is when its length tends to inﬁnity. The analogous quantum inﬁnite

multibarrier, which is the Kronig-Penney system [3, 4, 18], have been extensively discussed

in the literature by many authors and it is known by its famous band-gap energy spectrum

[3, 18] which is widely applied in electronics, semiconductors and solid state physics [19].

We discuss here the problem of a very large (inﬁnite) one-dimensional multitrap system

using the same transfer matrix method which were applied for studying the Kronig-Penney

multibarrier potential [3, 4, 18]. We, especially, discuss the energy of the diﬀusing particles

and apply similar methods as those used for studying the enegy spectrum of the quantum

Kronig-Penney multibarrier [18, 19].

By using the transfer matrix method for the unbounded classical multitrap system we

obtain a quadratic characteristic equation the two solutions of which give rise to two possible

expressions for the energy of the diﬀusing particles. Each of these two energies has a part

which is associated with the left hand face of the trap and another, diﬀerently expressed,

part related to the right hand face of it. The diﬀerent expressions of each of the two energies

2

at the left and right hand sides of the trap causes these energies to greatly diﬀer in value

at these faces. That is, we show that by merely diﬀusing through the trap the particles’s

energy enormously changes. All the analytical results are graphically corroborated.

We note that the energies of the bounded one-dimensional multitrap system were found

in [7] to have phase-transitional characteristics for the case in which an external ﬁeld was

appended to the system.

In Section II we apply the transfer matrix method for introducing and discussing the

unbounded one-dimensional multitrap system as done in [6, 7]. Note that by using the

transfer matrix formalism we also use its terminology which usually refers to an N-array

system [4] rather than to an inﬁnite array one. We remove this ﬁniteness by letting the

number of traps N and the total length L of the multitrap to become very large. In the

numerical part we assign to N and L the values of 15000 and 20000 (note that in [4] a

ﬁnite multibarrier potential composed of a few hundred barriers was used as a model for

the inﬁnite Kronig-Penney system). In Section III we discuss the energy associated with

the diﬀusing particles and ﬁnd, using Appendices A and B, the appropriate expressions

for it. In Section IV we calculate the energies for some speciﬁc values of its parameters.

In Section V we use the analytical results of Sections III-IV and those of the Appendices

A-B for graphically showing the energies as functions of its variables. We show that these

variables have certain values at which the corresponding energy becomes disallowed such as,

for example, when it tends to inﬁnity or becomes negative. Some analytical expressions and

derivations are shown in Appendices A-B. We conclude with a brief summary.

II. APPLICATION OF THE TRANSFER MATRIX METHOD FOR THE UN-

BOUNDED ONE-DIMENSIONAL MULTITRAP SYSTEM

The one-dimensional imperfect multitrap system is assumed to be arranged along the

whole positive x axis and the diﬀusing particles which pass through it are supposed to come

from the negative side of it. We denote, as in [6, 7], the total width of all the traps and the

total interval among them by a and b respectively where a and b tend to become very much

large. The ratio of b to a and the total length a + b of the system are denoted respectively
by c and L. As in [6, 7] we may express a and b by c and L as a = L
period of the multibarrier system which is L

(1+c) . The
N is denoted by p. We assume that the multitrap

b = Lc

(1+c) ,

3

system begins at the point x = b

N = pc

(1+c).

The initial and boundary value problem [20] which is appropriate for describing the

diﬀusion through the N imperfect barriers is [6, 7]

1) ρt(x, t) = Dρxx(x, t),

t > 0,

0 < x

2) ρ(x, 0) = ρ0 + f (x),

where ρ(x, t), ρt(x, t) and ρxx(x, t) denote respectively the density of the diﬀusion particles,

its ﬁrst partial derivative with respect to the time t and its second partial derivative with

respect to x. The dissusion constant D is supposed to have two diﬀerent values; Di inside
the traps and De outside them where De > Di [6, 7]. The value of 0.5 cm2
sec

is the order of

magnitude of the diﬀusion constant at room temperature and atmospheric pressure (P. 337

in [21]). In the numerical part here we have assigned to De and Di the respective values
of 0.8 cm2

sec . The second equation of the set (1) is the initial condition which is
assumed [6, 7] to depend on x through f (x) and on the constant term ρ0. The third equation

sec and 0.4 cm2

of the set (1) is the boundary value condition at the location of the traps where each trap

has a ﬁnite width. That is, any trap is characterized by the two points along the x axis

where its left and right hand faces are located. The constant k is the trapping rate (or the

imperfection constant) which characterizes the degree of imperfection of the traps where the

ideal trap condition is obtained when k

. The set (1) may be decomposed into two

separate problems as follows [6, 7]

The sets (2) and (3) respectively represent the diﬀusion through N imperfect and N ideal

traps as may be realized from the third equations of these sets. Following [20] one may write

the general solution of the set (1) as [6, 7]

ρ(x, t) = Aρ1(x, t) + Bρ2(x, t),

where ρ1(x, t) and ρ2(x, t) are respectively the solutions of the problems (2) and (3). Using

the method of separating variables [20] one may ﬁnd the ideal trap solution [6, 7] as

(1+c) the locations of the left and hand side faces of the N-th trap are

III. THE ENERGY OF THE DIFFUSING PARTICLES IN THE ONE-

DIMENSIONAL MULTITRAP SYSTEM

In order to be able to reduce the inequalities (16)-(17) to calculable expressions we express

the parameters α and η, which were given by Eqs (A5) and (A7) in Appendix A, in terms

of the energy E of the diﬀusing particles. We use for that matter the relevant expressions

of the energy which were fully derived and discussed in [7] for the multitrap system. Thus,

using Eqs (4)-(6), we can write the energy E as

D

(x
`xi)
−
2√Dt

E(D, x, `xi, t) = (ρ(D, x, `xi, t))

= (A(x, D)α(D, x, `xi, t) + B(x, D)ρ2(D, x, `xi, t))

where the variables `xi denote the locations on the x axis of the 2N faces of the N traps

(see the solutions (5)-(6) of the respective ideal and imperfect trap problems (3) and (2)).

The imperfect and ideal trap coeﬃcients A(x, D) and B(x, D) are numerically found for

the 2N faces of the N traps x = `xj,
one may ﬁnd, using the transfer matrix method, the four pairs (1) A(`xlef t

The ﬁrst pair denote the ideal and imperfect trap coeﬃcients inside the j-th trap at its left

hand face. The second pair denote these coeﬃcients inside the j-th trap at its right hand

face. The third and fourth pairs denote these coeﬃcients outside the j-th trap at its left
and right hand faces. Note that these coeﬃcients, as well as the variables `xlef t
and `xright
j

,

j

are not independent of each other. First, one may realize (see the discussion after Eq (8))
that `xlef t

are given by `xlef t

N so that they

and `xright

j = p(j

As one may realize the `xi from Eq (18) does not have to coincide with `xj. That is, although

for the same j-th trap each of `xj and `xi denote its two faces, `xj may, for a speciﬁc context,
refers to its left hand face in which case it is written as `xlef t
context to its right hand face and is written as `xright

j whereas `xi may refers in this

.

j

Now, analogously to the Kronig-Penney case [3, 4, 18], one may turn the inequalities at

the right hand sides of (16)-(17) to equalities. In such case the left hand sides of (16)-(17)

are equated to cos(κp) where κ is a real parameter and p is the period of the multitrap which
is p = L

N . In accordance with the analogous procedure of the Kronig-Penney case [3, 4, 18]
the two eigenvalues of the characteristic equation are related to the same parameter. Note

that even if one relates the two eigenvalues to diﬀerent parameters he will obtain the same

following expressions (31)-(34) for the energies each of which depends on only one parameter.

We use in the following the transfer matrix principal property in which the density (and

its derivative) at the two sides of any face of each trap are equal [3, 4, 6]. This may be

9

expressed, for example, for the left hand face of the j-th trap as

The two quadratic equations (25)-(26) were simultaneously solved in Appendix B for the

energies E(De, p, `xi, t) and E(De,

pc
(1+c) , `xi, t) and two separate solutions were found for each

(see Eqs (B6)-(B9) in Appendix B). For E(De, p, `xi, t) we ﬁnd the two solutions of

E+(De, p, `xi, t) =

where the quantities X1, X2, X3, X4, X5 and Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, Y5 are given respectively
by Eqs (B1) and (B4) in Appendix B. The energies E+(De, p, `xi, t) and E−(De, p, `xi, t) from
Eqs (27)-(28) are for the right hand side of the trap and the energies E+(De,

The second case is that of `xi = p for which one obtains from Eq (5) and from Eqs (B1) in

whereas the energy E+(De,

(1+c) , p, t) from Eq (29) remains in the value of Y3

. This also

pc

could not be accepted since it implied that the particles suddenly stop diﬀusing after the

ﬁrst trap whereas we are concerned with the diﬀusion along the entire multitrap system.

Thus, the energies E+(De, p, p, t) and E+(De,
take into account only the energies E−(De, p, p, t) and E−(De,

(1+c), p, t) must be discarded and we have to

IV. CALCULATION OF THE ENERGIES (31)-(34) FOR SPECIFIC VALUES OF

E−(De,

The expressions (31)-(34) for the energies E+(De, p,

pc
(1+c), t),
(1+c), p, t), E−(De, p, p, t) should now be evaluated as functions of κp as done for
the quantum Kronig-Penney system [3, 4, 18]. But before doing that we show that the ex-
pressions (31)-(34) become simpliﬁed for certain values of κp. Thus, for κp = π

2 + nπ, n =
0, 1, 2, . . . one have cos(κp) = 0 and from Eqs (B4) and the ﬁrst of Eqs (B1) in Appendix B

(1+c) , t), E+(De,

we have Y5 = X1 = 0 and also the second terms of Y1, Y2 and Y3 vanish as well. Thus, the

For obtaining Eqs (35) and (37) we respectively use the ﬁfth and third of Eqs (B1) in

Appendix B and for Eqs (36) and (38) we respectively use the third and second of Eqs (B4)

in Appendix B. Use is also made of Eq (A5) in Appendix A and the ﬁrst of Eqs (B4) in

Appendix B.

Another kind of points which draw special attention is κp = arc(cos( A(p,De)

(1+c) ,De))) for
which one obtains from the ﬁrst of Eqs (B1) in Appendix B X1 = 1. At these points the
pc
energies E+(De, p,
(1+c) , p, t) from Eqs (31) and (33) must be discarded
since they tend to inﬁnity and this can not be accepted on physical grounds. Note that

V. THE ENERGIES AS FUNCTIONS OF κp, c, k, AND t.

As seen from Eqs (B1) and (B4) in Appendix B, (A5) in Appendix A and from Eqs

(5)-(6) the energies (31)-(34) critically depend upon the ratio c, the trapping rate k and the

time t. Also, one may conclude from the analytical form of the expressions (31)-(34) and

pc
from the Panels of Figures 1-4 that the energy E+(De, p,
(1+c), t) from Eq (31) corresponds
to E−(De,

(1+c), p, t) from Eq (33) and E+(De,
(1+c), t) from Eq (32) corresponds to

pc
(1+c),

pc

E−(De, p, p, t) from Eq (34). That is, E+(De, p,
pc
(1+c) , p, t) are expressed
pc
pc
only by the ideal trap expressions from Eqs (B1) in Appendix B and E+(De,
(1+c) , t)
(1+c),
and E−(De, p, p, t) are given only by the imperfect trap expressions from Eqs (B4) of Ap-
pendix B. The corresponding energies E+(De, p,

pc
(1+c) , p, t) as functions
of κp are characterized with a behaviour which causes them to abruptly change their values

(1+c) , t) and E−(De,

(1+c) , t) and E−(De,

pc

in a rather jumpy and discontinuous way (see, for example, the Panels of Figures 1-2). As

one may assume these abrupt changes in the energies (31) and (33) are related to the values

of κp for which (X1) in their denominator is close to 1. Note that the nonzero values of

these energies may be negative in which case they can not represent real energies since we

of energies E+(De,

discuss here only kinetic energies as realized from Eq (18). The second corresponding pair
(1+c), t) and E−(De, p, p, t) are characterized as steeply increasing
0.05 they become constant (as functions of

pc
(1+c),
with κp for very small values of it and at κp

≈
κp) for all κp > 0.05 (see, for example, the Panels of Figures 3 and 4). Also, in contrast to

pc

the former pair, these energies are always positive.

From the Panels of Figures 1-4 one may realize that, for the same values of c, k and

t, the nonzero values of the energy E−(De,

pc
(1+c) , p, t) are generally greater by several or-
ders of magnitude from the other three energies (see, for example, Panels 1-2 of Figure
4 which show a giant diﬀerence of 1044 between E−(De,
Thus, although, as mentioned, the energies E−(De, p, p, t) and E−(De,

pc
(1+c) , t) as functions of κp using the same 20 diﬀerent values of the ratio c
for each Panel and the same t and k for all the graphs shown. The 20 values of c are

c = 0.1 + n

0.4,

n = 0, 1, 2, . . . 19 and the values of t and k for all the graphs shown

in the two Panels are t = k = 2. Note that although the energies shown in Panels 1 and

2 look similar as functions of κp the nonzero values of these energies diﬀer by as much as

104. As mentioned, we should consider only the zero or the positive parts of the graphs as

representing real kinetic energy.

In Panels 3 and 4 of Figure 1 we show enlarged views of the small sections in the respective

Panels 1 and 2 just to the right of the point κp = 0. Note the similarity between these

energies even at this small resolution and also note that despite this similarity the nonzero

show a hight resolution of the respective neighbourhouds in Panels 1 and 2 just to the right of the

point κp = 0. Note that although Panels 1 and 2 as well as Panels 3 and 4 are similar in form they

greatly diﬀer in the nonzero values of their energies. Both the trapping rate k and the time t have

the values of k = t = 2 for all the graphs of the four Panels. The units of the energies are in ergs.

parts of the energy in Panel 3 are about 0.5

104 erg whereas those of Panel 4 are about

·
0.4 erg. The largest hooked negative graph corresponds to the smallest value of c and as c

increases the other hooked positive and negative graphs are added. The larger c becomes

in Panels 3-4 the corresponding energies become smaller and tend to be densely arrayed

around zero. This means that the larger is the interval between the traps compared to their

width the kinetic energy of the diﬀusing particles tends to decrease to zero.

The same similarity in graphical form and same large diﬀerences in values may be shown

15

for the same energies from Figure 1, as functions of κp, but now for diﬀerent values of

the trapping rate k. This is seen in Panels 1 and 2 of Figure 2 which respectively show
the energies E−(De,

pc
(1+c), t) as functions of κp using the same 20
diﬀerent values of k for each Panel and the same t and c for all the graphs shown. The 20

(1+c) , p, t) and E+(De, p,

pc

values of k for each panel are k = 0.1 + n

0.4, n = 1, 2, . . . 19 and the values of t and c for

·

all the graphs in the two Panels are t = 2 and c = 1. As for Panels 1 and 2 of Figure 1 the

diﬀerences between the nonzero parts of these energies amount to about 104 although they

look similar in external form. Note that actually the energy in Panel 2 tends to zero. Panels

3 and 4 of Figure 2 respectively show enlarged views of the respective neighbourhouds from

Panels 1 and 2 about the point κp = 25. One may note the similarity between these energies

even at this small resolution. Also, one may note that despite this apparent similarity the

nonzero parts of the energy in Panel 3 is about 104 whereas the corresponding ones in Panel

4 tend to zero.

For both Panels 3 and 4 the graphs with the large dense hooked positive parts correspond

to the smallest values of k which means, as one may assume, that the smaller is the trapping

rate of the traps the larger is the energy of the diﬀusing particles. As k increases the

corresponding graphs become negative and they tend to zero for large enough k. That is,

the more k grows which means that the larger becomes the trapping rate of the trap the

more restrained and blocked become the diﬀusing particles in their passage through it. This

is demonstrated through the vanishing of the positive allowed parts of the energies for large

k and their tendency to the zero value.

In the Panels of Figures 1-2 we compare for diﬀerent values of c and k the two cor-

As seen from the Panels of Figures 1-3 the diﬀusing particles’s energy considerably

changes by merely passing through the trap. Thus, referring to the pair E−(De,
pc
(1+c) , p, t),
E−(De, p, p, t) one may realize the large change in kinetic energy the diﬀusing particles goes

through upon passing from the left hand side to the right hand side of the trap. For example,
comparing Panel 1 of Figure 1, which shows the energy E−(De,
pc
(1+c) , p, t) at the left hand
side of the trap to Panel 1 of Figure 3 which shows the energy E−(De, p, p, t) at the right

hand side of this trap for the same values of c, k and t one may realize that the particles’s

nonzero values of the energy changes upon diﬀusing through the trap from E

104 erg to

≈

≈

1 erg. These large diﬀerences may be realized again by comparing Panel 1 in Figure

E
2, which shows the energy E−(De,
pc
(1+c) , p, t) at the left hand side of the trap to Panel 3 of
Figure 3 which shows the energy E−(De, p, p, t) at the right hand side of it for the same

values of k, c and t. As seen, the particles’s nonzero values of the energy decreases upon

passage of the trap from E

104 to E

15. Thus, one may conclude that by diﬀusing

≈

≈

through the traps the particles lose a huge amount of the energy they possess before the

diﬀusion.

The time evolutions of the energies from Eqs (31)-(34) as functions of κp reveal in a more

pronounced way the mentioned large diﬀerences in the nonzero values of the energies. This
is demonstrated in the ﬁrst two Panels of Figure 4 which show the energies E−(De,
and E+(De, p,

pc
(1+c) , p, t)

·

panel and for c = 2 and k = 1 for all the graphs shown. Note the giant diﬀerences of about

1044 between the nonzero values of the energies in Panels 1-2. Continuing to increase t

causes the energy in Panel 1 to grow (not shown) even beyond 1080 erg. In Panel 3 we show
a three-dimensional surface of the energies E−(De, p, p, t) as function of κp and the time t.

Note that it is constant with κp and decreases to zero, in contrast to the energy from Panel

1, as t increases. Panel 4 shows the energy E+(De,

pc
(1+c), t), as function of κp, for the
0.5, n = 0, 1, . . . 19 and for c = 2 and k = 1 for all the graphs. The

20 values of t = 1 + n

·

dense line just above the abcissa axis denote the higher values of t for which the constant

values of the energy (as function of κp) tend, like those of Panel 3, to zero.

From the discussion thus far one may realize that generally the nonzero values of the

and E+(De,

0.088 erg. The energy E+(De, p, p, t) at Panel 1 depends only slightly on c, is constant for all κp’s

E+(De,

pc

and have a maximum value (for k = 2) of E+

max(De, p, p, t) = 1 erg. Panels 3 and 4 respectively

show three-dimensional surfaces of the same energies from Panels 1 and 2 but now as functions of

κp and k and for c = 1 and t = 2. Note that these energies do not depend at all on κp and vary with
k to the maxima (for c = 1) of E−
Note also that the energies E−(De, p, p, t) and E+(De,

energy E−(De,

pc
(1+c) , p, t) are greater by several order of magnitudes from the other three
energies as shown by comparing the Panels of Figures 1, 2 and 4. These great diﬀerences are

further pronounced for increasing values of the time as shown in the Panel 1 of Figure 3. But

that is no more so when the time decreases as turns out (not shown) when the energies were

calculated at small times. Thus, for example, decreasing the time from t
0.2
causes the nonzero values of the energy E−(De,
(1+c) , p, t) to decrease from about 1044 erg
(see Panels 1 of Figure 4) to about 100 erg. Likewise, the energy E−(De, p, p, t) decreases

from about 15 erg (see Panel 3 of Figure 3) for t = 2 to 3 erg for t = 0.2 (not shown).

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have discussed, using the transfer matrix method, the energy of the particles which

diﬀuse through the unbounded one-dimensional multitrap system. Solving the related

quadratic characteristic equation we have found that there are two possible expressions

for the energy which may be related to the diﬀusing particles. Each of these two energies is

composed of two parts; one is related to the left hand face of the trap and the second to its

right hand face. We have found that the two parts of each of the two energies diﬀer greatly

from each other not only in value but also in the way they are expressed as functions of the

related variables c, k, t and κp. That is, as seen from the Equations (31)-(34) one part of

any of these energies is expressed in ideal trap terms only and the second part in imperfect

trap terms only. These diﬀerences entail the results that by merely diﬀusing through the

trap the particles’s energy totally change as realized from the appended ﬁgures. Moreover,

there exist great variations not only among the two parts of the two energies (or of the same

energy) but also between diﬀerent sections (along the κp axis) of the same part itself. For
example, in Panel 1 of Figure 4 we have found that the energy E−(De, `xlef t
hand face of the trap assumes both values of zero and 1044 erg.

the values of the matrix elements T11 and T22 as may be realized from their deﬁnitions in

Eqs (A1) and (A4) in this Appendix. Also, in [6, 7] we discuss the whole array of the

bounded dense multitrap in which case the variables `xi and `xj do not, necessarily, refer to

the same trap and so this subraction is ignored there. Here, on the other hand, the variables

`xi and `xj refer to the same trap which represents the unbounded multitrap system and so
the expression (`xj −

`xi) should not be approximated to `xj.

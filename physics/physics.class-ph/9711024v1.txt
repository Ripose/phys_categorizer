FAILURE OF LORENTZ-DIRAC APPROACH
TO RADIATION REACTION
FOR EXTREMELY LARGE VELOCITIES ?

On the model of moving rigid charged body is shown that the Lorentz-Dirac
approach to radiation reaction in classical electrodynamics does not work for
trajectories of body close to the light cone.

03.50.De

Since the famous Dirac’s paper on relativistic radiation reaction in clas-
sical electrodynamics, many textbooks and research articles were published
on that theme. Among them are [1-11], where one can ﬁnd the discussion of
the related problems: mass renormalization and its nonuniqueness, runaway
solutions and the use of the advanced interaction.( These problems of radi-
ation reaction one can ﬁnd also in other classical ﬁeld theories - scalar ﬁeld
theory, gravitational theory, etc.). For recent review of the problems see [12].
Here we present the new puzzle connected with the Lorentz-Dirac ap-

proach.

In the literature the derivations of relativistic form of radiation force are
made under the ”hidden” assumption that all the expansions in powers used
near the particle trajectory are valid for the whole range of values of particle
velocity, in particular, arbitrary close to that of the light.
But it is easy to see that this is not true in general.
For example let’s consider the model of extended particle with charge Q,

density ρ and density current ~j = ~v

ρ.
Then the force, acting on this particle from self electromagnetic ﬁeld is

And this is what is done in literature, while extracting from (1) the ex-

pression for the radiation force for small object (a

Let’s examine this idea in details.
Consider the model of the rigid charged sphere with radius a moving with
velocity ~v(t) = d ~R(t)/dt. The total charge of the sphere is Q with density
ρ(t, ~r) = Q
a). (We are aware that physically this model is
not realized - in the relativity theory there are no absolutely rigid bodies,
so we consider this model only as convenient mathematical tool). Then the
Maxwell equations give the following expression for the retarded electric ﬁeld
of this sphere:

For simplicity let the sphere move as a rigid body along the z-axis.
To ﬁnd the total force ~Fself , acting on the moving sphere from its elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld, one must integrate the expression (9) over the sphere (due
to the motion on a straight line the Lorentz force is absent). This gives the
following expression for the z- component of the force:

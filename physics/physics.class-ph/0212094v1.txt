We have previously disussed the one-dimensional multitrap system of (cid:28)nite range and

found the somewhat unexpeted result that the larger is the number of imperfet traps

the higher is the transmission through them. We disuss in this work the e(cid:27)et of a

smal l number of suh traps arrayed along either a onstant or a variable (cid:28)nite spatial

setion. It is shown that under spei(cid:28) onditions, to be desribed in the fol lowing, the

remarked high transmission may be obtained for this ase also. Thus, ompared to the

theoretial large number of traps ase these results may be experimental ly applied to real

phenomena

Introdution

The problem of di(cid:27)usion through traps [1, 2, 3, 4, 5℄ is generally disussed in the literature

by refering to the single trap system. The few papers that disuss multitrap systems (see,

for example, [6℄) do not generally refer to the spatial density of these traps in the region

they oupy. Thus, this region is assumed to grow proportionally to the number of traps it

ontains. In [7℄ the aspet of the density of one-dimensional traps in a (cid:28)nite spatial setion

was disussed and it was shown that the larger this density is the higher is the transmission

of partiles through this dense system of traps. In this work we refer, espeially, to the small

number of traps system and (cid:28)nd the onditions under whih the transmission through them

is maximal. That is, assuming an ensemble of lassial partiles we look for the onditions

that enable all or most of them to pass through the trap system. We apply in this work the

transfer matrix method [8, 9℄ used in [7℄ with respet to the multitrap system.

In Setion II we disuss the one-dimensional N trap system and pay speial attention to

a small setion of it that inludes m traps where m is a small number. We will (cid:28)nd how the

passage of lassial partiles through this subsystem is in(cid:29)uened by the relevant parameters

of it. These parameters are the number m of traps, the total extent L of the subsystem, the

ratio c of the total interval among its traps to the total width of them [7℄, the time at whih

the subsystem is observed and the degree k of its imperfetion. Note that the ideal trap is

haraterized [2, 3℄ by k

it.

→ ∞ in whih ase all the approahing partiles are absorbed by

In Setion III we disuss the behaviour of the transmission amplitude for some spei(cid:28)

values of its parameters. This transmission amplitude is de(cid:28)ned [7℄ as the ratio of the value

of the imperfet trap oe(cid:30)ient of the transmitted partiles at the last trap to its value at

the (cid:28)rst one. We show that this amplitude inreases to unity for inreasing c and for large

values of the remarked variables L, and k . This amplitude, on the other hand, dereases with

inreasing t. Note that although one may expet the transmission to derease for inreasing

k sine this signi(cid:28)es, as remarked, a strengthening of the ideal harater of the trap system

whih entails a large absorption of the passing partiles, nevertheless the obtained results

are exatly the opposite. We show that the deviation from the expeted results is due to

the initial and boundary-value onditions we employ for the imperfet trap system disussed

here (see the set (3) in [7℄) whih are di(cid:27)erent from those of the ideal ones (see the set

(2) in [7℄). That is, the in(cid:29)uene of the time fator that emerges from these onditions is

muh more large than that of k in suh a way that it veils the expeted in(cid:29)uene of the

latter espeially during the initial time. We aompany our alulations with (cid:28)gures that

trap system

(see Eq (21) in [7℄)

The appliation of the transfer matrix to the one-dimensional N trap system has already

been disussed in details in [7℄ so we write the entral transfer matrix equation for this system

The last matrix equation enables one to obtain the oe(cid:30)ients A and B of the general

solution [7, 11℄ ρ(x, t) = Aρ1(x, t) + Bρ2(x, t) of the relevant di(cid:27)usion equation. ρ(x, t) is

the density of the passing lassial partiles and ρ1(x, t), ρ2(x, t) are the ideal and imperfet

trap omponents respetively of ρ(x, t). Eah T is a two-dimensional transfer matrix that

relates the oe(cid:30)eients A and B of the ideal and imperfet trap density funtions of the

passing partiles at one side of the relevant trap to those at the other side. The total width

of all the traps and the total interval among them are denoted by a and b respetively, the

number of traps is N and by n we denote the general trap in this system. Note that eah

matrix T depends also [7℄ upon the time t, the onstant k that is related to the imperfet

trap aspet of the system [7℄, and upon the two di(cid:27)usion onstants De and Di where De

denotes the external di(cid:27)usion onstant between the traps and Di is that inside them. But,

as seen in [7℄ (see also Eq (1)), the matries T di(cid:27)er from eah other by only the values of x

and share the same values of k , t, De and Di .

It was shown in [7℄ for the multitrap system that the transmission oe(cid:30)ient whih was

alulated as the ratio of the imperfet trap oe(cid:30)ient of the partiles after passing through

the system to that before this passage tends to unity for the ases of: 1) when the total length

of the system L = a + b grows. 2) when the total length L is onstant and the ratio

b
a of the

total interval to the total width of the system inreases. For these two ases the elements

T21 and T22 tend to zero (as remarked, the value of the element T12 is always zero) and T11

tends to unity whih are the required onditions to obtain a unity value for the transmission

oe(cid:30)ient. Moreover, it has been shown [7℄ that these spei(cid:28) values of the elements T21 , T22

and T11 are, espeially, obtained in the limit of N

→ ∞. We want here to (cid:28)nd if this kind of

behaviour may be diserned in small setions of the N system that ontain small number of

traps. We show in the following that the transmission oe(cid:30)ient may indeed assume, under

ertain onditions, a unity value for this ase also. Thus, refering to a two trap setion in

the N system we may write, using Eq (1), the relevant matrix expression for it

In order to be able to solve the last equation for

that the larger is the number of imperfet traps the lassial partiles pass the smaller

beomes their ideal trap omponent ompared to the imperfet one. In [7℄ whih disuss,

espeially, the ase of a very large number of traps the ratio of the ideal trap omponent at

the last trap to the imperfet one at the (cid:28)rst trap was equated to zero. We disuss here the

ase of a small number m so we may assume that this ratio depends on m and

The last expression ensures that the ratio at the left hand side vanishes in the limit of a very

Note that the parameter m refers to the (cid:28)nite m trap system whih is a susbsystem of the

dereases to zero with inreasing m so that in the limit of very large m the transmission

amplitude tends to unity as shown in [7℄. The same result is obtained also for inreasing c
where c(m)

3 Results for some given values of the trap system pa-

rameters m, L, k , and t

Unlike the disussion in [7℄ whih, espeially, takes aount of a large number of traps we

disuss here, as remarked, the in(cid:29)uene of a small number of them. First of all one (cid:28)nds, as

expeted, that the smaller is the number of traps m the easier is for the lassial partiles

to pass through them. The riterion for this transmission is, as remarked (see [7℄), the ratio

of the value of the imperfet trap oe(cid:30)ient at the last trap (of the m member subsystem)

to its value at the (cid:28)rst one. This is the ratio

from Eq (14) whih may be regarded

B2n+1

B

as a transmission amplitude. Note that this amplitude may have values outside the range

of (0, 1). An easy passage through the trap system is obtained not only for small values of

m but also for large values of the total length L of the system as we have found in [7℄ for

the multitrap ase. The same result is obtained also for large k whih denotes, as remarked,

the imperfet nature of the traps. Note that the nature of the hange of the transmission

amplitude with time is opposite to that regarding k and L. That is, this amplitude dereases

with inreasing time. Moreover, this derease ours in a very fast manner, espeially at the

initial time, ompared to the remarked inrease with k and L as may be seen in Figures 7-11.

Eah of the following 11 (cid:28)gures ontains six urves of the transmission amplitude from

Eq (14) as funtions of the parameter c for the six values of m = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. As remarked

and shown in [7℄ with respet to the multitrap system this transmission amplitude tends to

unity for large values of c. We (cid:28)nd here the dependene of the transmission upon c for small

m and the small range of 0.001

c

20. All the urves in the 11 (cid:28)gures are drawn for the

≤

≤

spei(cid:28) values of De = 0.5 and Di = 0.1. These values yield results that are qualitatively

similar for a wide lass of di(cid:27)erent appliations that use the trap system as a model (for

example, 0.5 cm2
sec

is the order of magnitude one may (cid:28)nd in the literature for the di(cid:27)usion

onstant D at room temperature and atmospheri pressure (p. 337 in [12℄)). We (cid:28)nd that

the larger is m the slower is the approah of its orresponding urve to unity ompared to

that of the smaller m urves. Thus, not all the six urves for m = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 are atually

shown in eah (cid:28)gure as in Figures 1, 4 and 5 in whih the larger m urves are merged with

the abissa axis. The orret order of the urves in eah (cid:28)gure is downward so that smaller

values of m (cid:28)t the upper urves (the graph for m = 1 is the upper one, that for m = 3 is the

seond from above and so on).

The group of Figures 1-9 is omposed of three rows and three olumns that demonstrate

this behaviour of the transmission amplitude from Eq (14) as funtion of c. The (cid:28)rst row

shows three (cid:28)gures, eah omposed of six urves for m = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, that show how the

transmission amplitude hanges with c for the same values of k = 1 and t = 1 but three

di(cid:27)erent values of L = 5, 13, 27. The left hand side (cid:28)gure in the (cid:28)rst row is for L = 5 and

shows only the urves for m = 1, 3, 5, 7 whereas those for m = 9, 11 are merged with the

abissa axis. The middle (cid:28)gure in the (cid:28)rst row, whih is for L = 13, shows all the six urves

approahing unity as c grows but, as remarked, this approah is slower the larger is m. The

right hand side (cid:28)gure of the (cid:28)rst row, whih is for L = 27, shows one again all the six urves

approahing unity but now even the larger m urves tend to unity already at small values of

c ompared to the middle (cid:28)gure. Thus, as remarked and as shown for the multitrap system

3 RESULTS FOR SOME GIVEN VALUES OF THE TRAP SYSTEM PARAMETERS M , L,

, AND 9

in [7℄, the approah of the transmission amplitude to unity is more apparent and faster, even

for small c, the larger is L.

The middle row shows how the transmission amplitude as a funtion of c hanges with

k . Eah urve from the total six urves of eah (cid:28)gure in the middle row is drawn for L = 5

and t = 1. The left hand side (cid:28)gure is for k = 5 and one may see only the urves for the 4

smaller values of m that tend to unity for inreasing c. The other two urves for m = 9, 11

are merged with the abissa axis. The middle (cid:28)gure in the middle row is for k = 16 and

shows the graphs for the (cid:28)ve smaller m tending to unity as c grows. Note the little jump of

the graph for m = 9 at c = 16.2. The right hand side (cid:28)gure, whih is for k = 27, shows now

all the six (cid:28)gures without any intermediate jumps exept for the remarked di(cid:27)erene in the

rate of their approah to unity. Thus, as remarked the higher k values guarantees an easy

transmission of the passing partiles through the system. Note that, as remarked, this high

transmission for inreasing k is ontrary to what one may expet that large k entails a large

absorption [2, 3, 7℄ of the passing partiles. The deviation of the obtained results from the

expeted ones is beause the trap problem we try to solve here, as in [7℄, is the imperfet

trap one and not the ideal one. Thus, the initial and boundary-value onditions employed

are not the ideal ones (see set (2) in [7℄) but the imperfet (see set (3) in [7℄) and these may

ause a large transmission even at the ideal trap limit of k

→ ∞ as atually shown in [7℄ (see

Figure 2 there). The presene of the time fator in the initial and boundary-value onditions

introdues interesting results that do not appear in the absene of it. For example, the

analogous quantum one-dimensional multibarrier system along a (cid:28)nite setion [10℄ does not

involve any time variation and as a onsequene the kind of hange with time found here

is not enountered there [10℄. This kind of hange is espeially realized in the muh more

apparent and onspiuous manner, ompared to that enountered for L and k , by whih

the transmission amplitude as funtion of c hanges for di(cid:27)erent values of the time t. First

of all, unlike the ases for k and l, this amplitude dereases with inreasing t espeially at

the initial values of it. This is seen in the third row in Figures 7-9 where all the six urves

4 CONCLUDING REMARKS

in eah (cid:28)gure of this row is drawn for L = 13 and k = 7. The urves of the right hand

side (cid:28)gure are graphed for t = 0.01 and one may see that all the six urves tend uniformly

as a single graph to unity already at small value of c. The middle (cid:28)gure of the third row

is for t = 0.05 and one see how at the very small time span of 0.04 the urves beome

separated and disernable from eah other. By further inreasing the time to t = 1.6 as in

the left hand side (cid:28)gure one is able to widely separate the six urves so as to ause those

that orrespond to the higher m values to tend slowly to unity ompared to those of the

lower m. This form of the (cid:28)gure generally remains stabilized with time and hange only

slightly by further inreasing the time. In other words, a very large hange in the behaviour

of the transmission amplitude, as a funtion of c, ours during the initial time and then it

remains almost stabilized. To further demonstrate the large in(cid:29)uene of time we show in

Figures 10 the transmission amplitude, as funtion of c, for L = 13, k = 7 and t = 1 and for

m = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. A very similar (cid:28)gure is shown in Figure 2 whih is drawn for the same

values of L, t and m but for k = 1. That is, inreasing k from k = 1 by 6 units, keeping

the same values of L = 13 and t = 1, have a negligible in(cid:29)uene upon the transmission

amplitude. But inreasing the time by only 0.6, keeping the former values of L, m and k ,

results in a disernable e(cid:27)et upon the transmission amplitude as shown in Figure 11 whih

is drawn for the same values of L, k and m as in Figure 10 but at t = 1.6 (ompare the two

(cid:28)gures 10-11).

4 Conluding Remarks

We have disussed in this work the e(cid:27)ets of a one dimensional trap system upon the density

of the passing lassial partiles. We have limit our disussion to the ase of small number

of traps (the large number ase was disussed in [7℄). As our analytial means we use the

transfer matrix method disussed in [7℄ with respet to the one-dimensional multitrap system.

We have shown that the transmission amplitude tends to unity, for growing c, not only in

REFERENCES

the limit of a very large number of traps as in [7℄ but also, under ertain onditions, for the

small number of them. These onditions involve either a large value of the parameter k that

denotes the imperfet trap harater of the system or a large value of the total length L of

it. These results have been exempli(cid:28)ed for spei(cid:28) values of k and L and demonstrated by

the attahed (cid:28)gures.

Unlike the remarked hange of this amplitude with respet to k and L it has an opposite

behaviour regarding the time t. That is, it dereases for all values of m as t inreases where

this derease is larger for large m. Also, ompared to k and L, this hange with time is

very fast espeially at the initial time and then the transmission amplitude stabilizes and

hanges only slightly with time. We have also shown for small m, as for the multitrap

system in [7℄, that the imperfet harater of the system whih is expressed in its initial

and boundary-value onditions auses it to behave ontrary to what is expeted for large k .

That is, although large value of k indiates, as remarked, a large absorption of the passing

partiles, nevertheless, we (cid:28)nd a high transmission for large k due to the appearane of

time in the initial and boundary-value onditions. The large in(cid:29)uene of the time upon the

transmission amplitude have been shown and demonstrated in Figures 7-11.

Eah one of the nine (cid:28)gures shown above is omposed of six urves of the transmission amplitude

B2n+1
2(n−2)+1

as a funtion of the ratio c for the values of m = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. It is seen that all the
B
urves in all the (cid:28)gures tend to unity for large c. . The larger is m the slower is its approah
to unity ompared to that of the smaller m. Thus, not all the six graphs are shown in all
the (cid:28)gures beause the urves for the larger m are drawn towards the abissa axis and even

merge with it as in Figures 1, 4 and 5. The (cid:28)rst row shows some examples of the hange of the

transmission amplitude with c for di(cid:27)erent values of L, the seond row shows it for di(cid:27)erent
values of k and the third for t. Note the large hange aused to the tramnsmission amplitude

by slightly inreasing the time as in Figures 7-9 (see also Figures 10-11). Also note that the

harater of the hange with t is opposite to that with k and L, that is, it dereases with

inreasing time.

These (cid:28)gures demonstrate the large in(cid:29)uene of time, ompared to that of the other parameters,

upon the transmission amplitude. Figure 10 shows the transmission amplitudes as a funtion

of c for L = 13, k = 7 and t = 1 and m = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Comparing this (cid:28)gure with Figure
2 whih was drawn for the same values of L and t but for k = 1 one realize that inreasing k
by 6 units, keeping the same values of L and t, has very little in(cid:29)uene upon the transmission

amplitude. But when we ompare it to Figure 11 (it is the same as Figure 7) whih was drawn

for L = 13, k = 7 and t = 1.6 we see that inreasing the time by only 0.6, keeping the same
values of L and k as in Figure 10, results in an apparent di(cid:27)erene.

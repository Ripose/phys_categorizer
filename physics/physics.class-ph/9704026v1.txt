Abstract

We apply expansion methods to obtain an approximate expression in terms

of elementary functions for the space and time dependence of wave packets

in a dispersive medium. The speciﬁc application to pulses in a cold plasma is

considered in detail, and the explicit analytic formula that results is provided.

When certain general initial conditions are satisﬁed, these expressions describe

the packet evolution quite well. We conclude by employing the method to

exhibit aspects of dispersive pulse propagation in a cold plasma, and suggest

how predicted and experimental eﬀects may be compared to improve the

theoretical description of a medium’s dispersive properties.

I. INTRODUCTION

A systematic study of the propagation of electromagnetic pulses in a dispersive medium

originated with Sommerfeld [1,2] and Brillouin [3,4]. The subject has subsequently been

studied by means of a number of interesting methods and novel interpretations; see for

example references [5–8] and references therein. Some of these methods are extensions to

the classic Sommerfeld-Brillouin theory.

The purpose of this paper is ﬁrstly to provide an analytic expression for the behavior

of dispersive wave packets by use of a straightforward method [see Eq. (8)], along with a

description of the initial conditions that must be satisﬁed in order to render this expression

valid. Secondly, we furnish the explicit formula that results when the method is applied

to the case of Gaussian pulses in a cold plasma [see Eq.

(16)]. We conclude by using

the method to discuss and exhibit features of the dispersive propagation and interaction of

multiple pulses in such a plasma.

II. GENERAL METHOD

The method we employ is based on Taylor expansion techniques and Gaussian wave

packet expansion techniques that allow required integrals to be computed exactly. More

speciﬁcally, we expand an initial wave packet as a superposition of Gaussian packets; then

power-expand the dispersion relation to second order around the dominant wavenumber

of each Gaussian. This allows for an exact solution of the Fourier integral describing the

evolution of the packet.

We take as our starting point the standard linear Fourier integral [9,10] describing the

propagation of a pulse E(x, t) in a medium of dispersion ω(k):

E(x, t) =

∞

A(k)ei(kx

ω(k)t) dk,

−

Z

−∞

(1)

where A(k) must be chosen to satisfy the initial boundary conditions for E(x, t) [9]. For

simplicity, we assume that d

dtE(x, 0) = 0, so that A(k) is just the Fourier transform of the

2

initial pulse E(x, 0) = E0(x) [9,10],

A(k) =

∞

E0(x)e−

ikx dx.

2π Z

−∞

We then take the real part of Eq. (1), assume A(k) is real, and denote Re E(x, t) by E(x, t)

for simplicity

E(x, t) =

A(k) cos (kx

ω(k)t) dk.

The next step is to ﬁnd a ﬁt to E0(x) in the form of a superposition of sinusoidal wave

packets with a Gaussian envelope

where the constants ai, bi, fi are real, and ai > 0. Such a ﬁt can normally be found for a

localized initial packet E0(x). The Fourier transform of Eq. (4) can then be found exactly

as

(cid:21)

This amplitude is real, so the assumption below Eq.

(2) is valid. The dominant wave

numbers in Eq. (5) are

bi, i = 1, n, so we expand the dispersion relation ω(k) to second

order around each point

bi, i = 1, n, separately:

ω(k,

bi) = s0(

Equation (6) constitutes 2n expansions of ω(k), each expansion being centered around one of

the 2n points

bi, i = 1, n. The coeﬃcients sj(

bi) will in general depend on the parameters

describing the dispersion relation ω(k) of the dispersive medium.

We can now obtain a good approximation to Eq. (3) by using Eqs. (5) and (6) to expand

the integrand in Eq. (3) as a sum of 2n terms, where each term is centered on the major

wave numbers

bi, i = 1, n of the initial packet:

Note that Eq. (7) arises from a generalized expansion approach to Eq. (3), since it incor-

porates an arbitrary number of diﬀerent expansion points

expanded to a sum of 2n Gaussian terms by substituting Eq. (5) into Eq. (3), and the only

modiﬁcation of a term occurs via a Taylor expansion (6) of the factor ω(k) around the point

where the term is most inﬂuential. The advantage of the expansion (7) is that the resulting

integrals can now be found analytically as

1. Equation (8) is useful in the sense that it is

an explicit formula containing only elementary functions, and in the sense that it is quite

general. All one needs to do to apply it to a speciﬁc situation is to compute the power series

of the dispersion relation around the main wave numbers of the initial wave packet. The

accuracy of the expression (8) will of course increase as the number of expansion points are

increased. The formula provides for expansions of ω(k) up to second order, but one could

also of course limit the order to unity by taking s2(

bi) = 0 in Eq. (8).

We now discuss the initial conditions that must hold for Eq. (8) to be valid. From Eq.

In order for Eq. (8) to be applicable, one must require that a contribution (9) (for a

speciﬁc i) is appreciable only within the two areas of the k-line where the two second order

expansions ω(k,

bi) of ω(k) (for the above i) in Eq. (6) are valid. The remainders

±
parameters ai in Eq. (4), as noted from Eq. (10). Note that the n criteria in Eq. (11)

are independent, since the resultant packet E(x, t) in Eq. (3) is a linear combination of n

independent contributions of the form (9), as seen from Eq. (5).

III. COLD PLASMA APPLICATION

We now consider the speciﬁc case of a pulse propagating in a cold plasma. For simplicity,

we assume that the initial pulse can be approximated well by a single normalized Gaussian

packet centered at x = 0,

E0(x) = e−

cos(bx).

ax2

In this case, Eq. (8) must be applied with the parameters

n = 1, ai = a, bi = b, fi = 1.

For the cold plasma, we use the dispersion relation [11]

where c is the speed of light in vacuum, and ωp is the plasma frequency.

We then expand Eq. (14) around b and

b, to obtain the coeﬃcients in Eq. (6) as

1. Equation (16) is a general

equation, describing the dispersive behavior of pulses of the form (12) that propagate in a

medium with dispersion of the form (14).

The intervals I(

bi) and the validity criteria for Eq. (16) are found by substitution of

Eq. (13) in Eqs. (10) and (11). Since the dispersion relation ω(k) in Eq. (14) is symmetric

about k = 0, the validity criteria in Eq. (11) simplify. A second order expansion ω(k, b) of

the square root ω(k) =

c2k2 + ω2

p about a positive wave number b approximates ω(k) quite

well when k > 0, but fails when k < 0. One must therefore require the interval I(b) in Eq.

±

q

(10) to lie to the right of the origin of the k-line. According to Eq. (10), the left endpoint

of I(b) is to the right of the origin when b > 5√a. I(b) then lies within [0, b + 5√a], which

is within the interval I ′(b) of validity of the expansion ω(k, b) [given by Eqs. (6) and (15)]

of ω(k) [given by Eq. (14)]. A similar result holds for the expansion ω(k,

b) of

c2k2 + ω2
p

about a negative wave number

b. Hence, we have the useful initial condition that

−

q

(17)

−

for Eq.

(16) to be valid.

In other words, the approximation (16) is accurate when the

frequency b of the initial pulse E0(x) in Eq. (12) is high, or when E0(x) is broad (i.e. when

the pulse shape parameter a is small). However, we see from Eq. (17) that short pulses are

also well approximated by Eq. (16) when they are of high frequency, as well as low-frequency

pulses of long duration.

In the speciﬁc illustrations and discussions below, the pulse parameters a and b were of

course always chosen so that Eq. (17) was satisﬁed, with many choices such that b

√a >> 5.

As a double check, we also compared values for E(x, t) given by Eq. (16) with the values

for E(x, t) obtained by numerically integrating Eq. (3) [using Eqs. (5), (12), (13) and (14)]

for a systematic variation of values for x, t, a, b, c and ωp. For values of a and b obeying

Eq. (17), the agreement was excellent, as expected. The discrepancy between the exact and

approximate values for E(x, t) was typically found to be less than 10−

4.

Equation (16) represents two pulses traveling in opposite directions, as we expect [10]

7

from the initial condition d

dt E(x, 0) = 0, stated above Eq.

(2). For simplicity, in the

remaining part of this paper we focus only on the right-traveling pulse term in Eq. (16)

(which is the ﬁrst term in Eq. (16) when b is positive).

We now outline some of the features of the dispersive behavior of a single pulse in a

cold plasma, which can be observed from plots of Eq.

(16).

It is readily observed that

the envelope of a short initial pulse broadens more rapidly as time elapses compared to the

broadening of the envelope of a long initial pulse, the initial pulse frequencies being equal.

This is of course well known, and can be explained analytically [10].

It is also seen that in general, the number of oscillations within the pulse envelope in-

creases with time, and more interestingly, the eﬀect of dispersion on the pulse is to shift high-

frequency components of the pulse toward the spatial front of the pulse and low-frequency

components of the pulse toward the spatial rear of the pulse (see the pulse E1 in Fig. 4).

This eﬀect becomes more prominent as the initial pulse is shortened.

Additionally, the spatial packet velocity of a pulse increases as the pulse frequency is

increased (with spatial packet velocity we mean xmax/t, where xmax is the distance traveled

by the spatial maximum of the pulse envelope during a given time period t. Temporal

pulse velocity is similarly deﬁned as x/tmax, where tmax is the time that elapses before the

temporal maximum of the pulse envelope appears at a given distance x [5]). However, as

expected, in no cases is the center of a packet beyond the point x = ct at time t if it is at

the origin x = 0 at time t = 0. Here c is the velocity of light in vacuum, appearing in Eq.

(16) from the dispersion relation (14).

Moreover, the envelope shape is better maintained for a high frequency initial pulse

than for a low frequency initial pulse, the initial pulse durations being equal. Therefore,

increasing the frequency of a short pulse will improve the preservation of its shape as it

travels through a dispersive medium, as well as increase its packet speed. The propagation

of short, high-frequency pulses is a topic of strong current interest [12], [13].

We next examine the the dispersive evolution of more than one (right-traveling) pulse

8

through a cold plasma. One can readily do this by repetitive use of Eq. (16). For example,

the propagation of two initial pulses E01(x) = e−

cos(b1x) and E02(x) = e−

cos(b2x)

a1x2

a2x2

separated by an initial time delay d is described by

E(x, t) = E1(x, t) + E2(x, t),

(18)

where E1(x, t) and E2(x, t) are obtained by substituting (t

t + d, a

→

a1, b

b1) and

→

→

(a

a2, b

b2) respectively, into Eq. (16). The ﬁrst pulse E1 is here d time units ahead of

→

→

the second pulse E2 when E2 passes the origin x = 0 at the time t = 0 (A description of the

general dispersive behavior of m initial pulses E0j of the form (4) separated by initial time

delays dj can analogously be obtained from Eq. (8) by the set of substitutions t

t + dj,

→

aij, bi

bij for i = 1, n and j = 1, m ).

→
Figures 1 through 4 depict some features of dispersive double pulse propagation, as

→

described by Eqs.

(16) and (18). These ﬁgures also illustrate some of the properties of

single pulse propagation mentioned above (note that the packets in the top plots of Figs. 1

and 3 at the initial time t = 0 are identical to those given by Eq. (12), except that their

amplitudes have half the magnitude of those in Eq. (12). This is because half of the energy

of the initial packets is carried by the left-traveling parts of E(x, t), which are omitted from

all plots).

Figure 1 shows how two initially distinct packets of the same frequency and duration

gradually overlap and interact with each other due to the dispersive stretching of the two

packets as time elapses. Figure 2 shows the results of the interaction after a very long time.

One can clearly see the emergence of constructive and destructive interference eﬀects among

the diﬀerent spatial regions of the coalescing pulses.

In Fig. 3, a high frequency, short pulse is dispatched after the dispatch of a low frequency,

long pulse. We see that the high frequency pulse eventually overtakes the low frequency

pulse, in accord with the single-pulse feature that the packet velocity is greater for a high-

frequency initial pulse than a low-frequency initial pulse. The middle and bottom plots show

how the high frequency pulse interferes with the various spatial parts of the low frequency

9

pulse. The bottom plot depicts an instant of constructive interference between the two

pulses, where the total amplitude is larger than the separate amplitudes of either pulse. For

longer times than those shown in the ﬁgure, the high frequency pulse eventually passes and

leaves the other pulse.

As a ﬁnal example of a usage of Eq.

(16), one may employ this Eq.

to determine

parameters aj, bj, and initial time delays dj, (j = i, m) of m pulses such that they will all

have the same width and completely overlap at a speciﬁed time t while propagating in a

plasma of dispersion characterized by c, ωp and Eq. (14). Figure 4 shows a two-pulse version

of this, with t = 1000. We see that strong destructive and constructive interference eﬀects

occur in this case. A comparison of such predicted eﬀects with those found experimentally

in a speciﬁc medium could be used to determine the medium’s dispersion relation ω(k).

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have provided an analytic expression describing the propagation of dispersive wave

packets [Eq. (8)] provided the packets satisfy the applicability criteria (11). The expression

is obtained by a clear-cut method, and can be used to study properties of the propagation

process (for example pulse velocity and multiple pulse interference eﬀects due to dispersion).

In the speciﬁc case of packets propagating in a cold plasma, we used Eq. (8) with two

terms, and provided the explicit, analytic expression that results in this case [Eqs. (16) and

(18)]. For initial pulses satisfying the condition (17), Eq. (16) gives an accurate description

of single or multiple pulse propagation in a dispersive cold plasma.

As a ﬁnal note, it is conceivable that the presence or non-presence of eﬀects predicted

by Eqs. (8) and (16) could be used to verify, improve the equations for, or determine a

substance’s dispersive properties.

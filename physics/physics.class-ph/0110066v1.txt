We discuss two applications of Riccati equation to Newton’s laws of motion. The ﬁrst one is the motion of a particle under
the inﬂuence of a power law central potential V (r) = krǫ
. For zero total energy we show that the equation of motion can
be cast in the Riccati form. We brieﬂy show here an analogy to barotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Lemaitre cosmology where
the expansion of the universe can be also shown to obey a Riccati equation. A second application in classical mechanics,
where again the Riccati equation appears naturally, are problems involving quadratic friction. We use methods reminiscent to
nonrelativistic supersymmetry to generalize and solve such problems.

I. INTRODUCTION

II. THE POWER LAW CENTRAL POTENTIALS

It is known that Riccati equations, in general of the

type

dy
dx

= f (x)y2 + g(x)y + h(x) ,

(1)

ﬁnds surprisingly many applications in physics and math-
ematics. For example, supersymmetric quantum me-
chanics [1], variational calculus [2], nonlinear physics
[3], renormalization group equations for running coupling
constants in quantum ﬁeld theories [4] and thermody-
namics [5] are just a few topics where Riccati equations
play a key role. The main reason for their ubiquity is
that the change of function

turns it into linear second-order diﬀerential equations of

that stand as basic mathematical background for many
areas of physics.

Since the Riccati equation is a widely studied nonlinear
equation, knowing that the physical system under con-
sideration can be brought into Riccati form has certainly
many advantages.

It is therefore of interest to look for yet diﬀerent phys-
ical problems which are governed by this ﬁrst order non-
linear equation. This can be a starting point to new av-
enues in investigating analytical solutions of yet unsolved
problems. In this paper we concentrate mainly on top-
ics from classical mechanics and show that certain types
of Newton’s laws of motion are equivalent to the Riccati
equation.

After implementation of the angular momentum con-
servation law, the equation for the energy conservation
in the case of a central potential V (r) is given by the
standard expression

E =

m ˙r2 +

l2
2mr2 + V (r) .

Taking a derivative with respect to time of Eq. (4) results
into a second fundamental equation of the form

Specializing from now on to a power law potential [6]

(8)

Under the assumption of E = 0, this expression leads
to a Riccati form. Obviously with E = 0, we restrict
ourselves to the case k < 0. To explicitly derive from
(8) the Riccati equation we pass (as it is costummary in
central potential problems) to an angle θ as a free variable
(i.e., we consider r(θ(t)). With

which can be solved by the integrals

(11)

This is the Riccati equation for the motion of a particle
in a central power law potential assuming E = 0. It is
worth noting that no information about the coupling con-
stant k enters the Riccati equation (11). Essentially what
we have shown is that any solution of (4) will also sat-
isfy (11). The inverse is not necessarily true and should
be examined in detail. Indeed, the coupling constant k
should be explicitly contained in the solution for r(θ) (see
below).

A special case which deserves to be brieﬂy mentioned
is ǫ = −2. With this exponent, the choice E = 0 is, in
l2
2m + k < 0. Then directly from
general, only possible if
(4) we conclude that r
r is a constant which, of course, is
compatible with the Riccati equation (11). However, this
constant cannot be determined by means of (11). This
feature is also inherent in the general case.

′

To discuss the case ǫ 6= 2, we ﬁrst solve the Riccati

equation (11). The solution can be easily found to be

ω(θ) = tan

ǫ + 2
2

(cid:18)

θ +

β
2 (cid:19)

=

sin[(ǫ + 2)θ + β]
cos[(ǫ + 2)θ + β] + 1

,

(12)

where β plays a role of the integration constant. Going
back to the deﬁnition of ω in (10) we arrive at a solution
for r(θ)

r(θ) =

R
[1 + cos((ǫ + 2)θ + β)]1/(ǫ+2) ,

(13)

where R is a constant. As in the case ǫ = −2 this constant
can only be determined by inserting (11) into (4). The
result is

R =

l2
m|k| (cid:19)

(cid:18)

1
ǫ+2

.

(14)

The last two equations represent then the analytical so-
lution of the posed problem. We obtained this solution
by transforming the original problem into a Riccati equa-
tion. It might be that the laws of motion in Riccati form
are only a curiosity. Given, however, the fact that only a
few analytical solutions of the central potential problem
are known, it is certainly a useful curiosity. Further-
more, it is not excluded that this novel way opens new
more general methods to solve problems in mechanics. In
this context, we would like to mention here a yet diﬀer-
ent connection of the central potential problem with the
Ermakov nonlinear diﬀerential equation [7]. We refer to
the following form of the latter equation [8]

Taking p = const = m and suitably rescaling the distance

to (5). Indeed, in this case the integrals in (17) give

which, with a proper identiﬁcation of b, is the same as
directly integrating (5). The interplay between the Er-
makov equation and the central potential problems can
be a useful tool of studying both problems. We con-
jecture that certain invariants of the Ermakov equation
could be also applied to the central potential problems.

III. COSMOLOGICAL ANALOGY

We want to point out here a beautiful but formal cos-
mological analogy to the results of the previous section.
We recall that in deriving the Riccati equation (9) we
relied on a power law potential (6), a new parameter θ
(the angle given in (9)), and the assumption E = 0. The
analogy to cosmology is based on these observations. In
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime the set of Ein-
stein’s equations with the cosmological constant Λ set to
zero reduce to diﬀerential equations for the scale factor
a(t), which is a function of the comoving time t. Together
with the conservation of energy-momentum tensor they
are given by

3¨a(t) = −4πG(ρ + 3p(ρ))a(t)

a(t)¨a(t) + 2 ˙a2(t) + 2κ = 4πG(ρ − p(ρ))a2(t)

˙pa3(t) =

d
dt

a2(ρ + p(ρ)
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

.

(19)

(20)

(21)

In the above G is the Newtonian coupling constant, p is
the pressure, ρ is the density and κ can take the values
0, ±1. Choosing the equation of state to be barotropic

p(ρ) = (γ − 1)ρ ,

(22)

ﬁxes essentially ρ to obey a power law behaviour of the
form

ρ = ρ0 (cid:18)

(23)

can be then deduced that the following equivalent form
of γ can be obtained

and the remaining equation for a(t) reduce to a single
equation, viz

Introducing the conformal time η by

(25)

it can be seen that (24) is equivalent to a Riccati equation
in the function u = a
a , where the dot means derivation
with respect to η

+ cu2 + κc = 0 .

(26)

This cosmological Riccati equation has been previously
obtained by Faraoni [9] and also discussed by Rosu [10] in
the context of late cosmological acceleration. The formal
analogy to the mechanical case is obvious: the condition
E = 0 corresponds to Λ = 0, the angle θ is replaced
by the conformal time η, and whereas in the mechanical
example we had a power law behaviour of the potential,
the barotropic equation of state forces upon ρ to satisfy
ρ ∝ a−3γ. As (11) does not contain the coupling con-
stant k, the cosmological Riccati equation (26) loses the
information about G.

(30)

This resembles supersymmetric quantum mechanics and
we might be tempted to compare vp to Witten’s super-
potential.

To the new force we again add a quadratic function
with a friction coeﬃcient λ1 such that the new equation
of motion becomes

˙v = γ − λ1v2 .

(31)

′

− (α − λ1) r2

This has the advantage that per construction vp is a par-
ticular solution of (31). Equipped with this fact, one
can proceed to construct the general solution which is
a standard procedure in the general theory of the Ric-
cati equation. Before doing so, it is instructive to dwell
upon the physical meaning of the new force γ. Imposing
α2 > 0, it can be seen that γ > 0. Moreover,
g
as obvious from (28) and (30), γ goes to a constant for
large t and has a kink-like behaviour. We can then envis-
age a situation where γ is a ‘switch-on’ function for a force
becoming constant at some time. As mentioned above,
by construction the problem (31) is solvable because vp
is a particular solution of (31). By invoking the standard
Bernoulli ansatz for the general solution vg, namely

IV. QUADRATIC FRICTION

we arrive at the diﬀerential equation (special case of the
Bernoulli equation) for V

Starting with a constant force g (free fall, constant
electric ﬁeld, etc) and adding a quadratic friction with a
positive friction coeﬃcient ν > 0, we have, per excellence,
a Riccati equation for the Newton’s law of motion

˙v = g

(27)

Writing vp as

with g
≡ g/m and α ≡ ν/m. The general solution(which
for reasons to be seen later in the text we denote by vp)
involves a free parameter λ and reads [11]

where

(28)

In the following we borrow some techniques from super-
symmetric quantum mechanics. However, we do not fol-
low strictly the supersymmetric scheme as the purposes
in the quantum case and the mechanical case are quite
diﬀerent. We deﬁne a new time-dependent force by

IV. CONCLUSION

In this paper we have pointed out the usefulness of the
Riccati equation in studying certain mechanical prob-
lems. We derived a Riccati equation for a central po-
tential problem of the power law type assuming E = 0.
This led us to an analytical solution of the problem. In
a second step, we generalized the system of a constant
force plus a quadratic friction to a time-dependent force
and friction. We argued that this time-dependent force
serves as a ‘switch-on’ function. The problem turned out
to be solvable by means of a construction similar to su-
persymmetric quantum mechanics. As indicated in the
text, both applications can be generalized.

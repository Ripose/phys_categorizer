Heat transport at nanoscales in semiconductors is investigated with a statistical method. The
Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) which characterize phonons motion and interaction within
the crystal lattice has been simulated with a Monte Carlo technique. Our model takes into account
media frequency properties through the dispersion curves for longitudinal and transverse acoustic
branches. The BTE collisional term involving phonons scattering processes is simulated with the
Relaxation Times Approximation theory. A new distribution function accounting for the collisional
processes has been developed in order to respect energy conservation during phonons scattering
events. This non deterministic approach provides satisfactory results in what concerns phonons
transport in both ballistic and diﬀusion regimes. The simulation code has been tested with silicon
and germanium thin ﬁlms; temperature propagation within samples is presented and compared
to analytical solutions (in the diﬀusion regime). The two materials bulk thermal conductivity is
retrieved for temperature ranging between 100 K and 500 K. Heat transfer within a plane wall with
a large thermal gradient (250 K-500 K) is proposed in order to expose the model ability to simulate
conductivity thermal dependence on heat exchange at nanoscales. Finally, size eﬀects and validity
of heat conduction law are investigated for several slab thicknesses.

INTRODUCTION

The development of nanotechnologies has lead to an
unprecedented size reduction of the electronic and me-
chanical devices. For example, transistors of a few
nanometer size are now openly considered1. The heat
that will be dissipated by joule eﬀect in these semi-
conductors junctions will reach soon the levels of the heat
dissipated in a light bulb. This high volumetric heat dis-
sipation in electronic devices will have to be evacuated
very eﬃciently in order to avoid possible failures of the
systems. This task will not be achieve without a sharp
knowledge of the phenomena governing the heat transfer
at nanoscale. Furthermore, new technologies based on a
local heating are being developed in order to enlarge the
computer hard disk capacity. The ultimate limit of stor-
age is to write a byte at the atomic scale. This goal is
already feasible with near-ﬁeld microscope probes but at
a too slow rate. A way to write bytes at the nanometer
scale is the melting of a polymer by heating it on a very
short time scale (
1 ns) by an array of heated near-ﬁeld
probes2. In this example, the heat transfer has to be con-
trolled not only at the nanometer scale but also at the
nanosecond scale.

≤

Through these two examples, one can anticipate that
the foreseeing technological challenges in miniaturization
will have to solve more and more problems of heat trans-
fer at short time and space scale. However, the physics
of heat transfer usually used (Fourier’s law, Radiative
Transfer Equation) can no longer be applied when some
characteristic length scales are reached3. In thermal radi-
ation for example, wave eﬀects appear as the system char-
acteristic lengths becomes lower than the typical wave-
10µm at T = 300 K)4,5. A substantial in-
length (λ

∼

crease of the radiative heat transfer can even be reach
at nanometric distances6. On its side, heat conduction
is classically described by the Fourier law and the heat
conduction equation (∂T /∂t = α∆T ) which is a diﬀusion
equation. It is well known that this kind of equation can
be interpreted as a random walk of particles7.
In the
case of heat conduction, we are actually dealing with en-
ergy carriers which are electrons in metals and phonons
in crystalline materials. When these carriers undergo a
large number of collisions, the use of the diﬀusion equa-
tion is valid whereas a more careful study is required
when the number of interactions between carriers lowers.
A way to achieve this goal is to consider the evolu-
tion of a distribution function f (r, p, t) which describes
the number of particles in a certain elementary volume
d3rd3p around the point (r, p) in the phase space. The
evolution equation of f , called the Boltzmann Transport
Equation (BTE) makes f to vary in space and time under
the inﬂuence of advection, external force and collision8.
Note that this approach is not relevant to treat the wave
aspects of the problem such as interference or tunneling.
The understanding and the modeling of the collision term
is actually the key point in the resolution of the BTE. It
can sometimes be fully modelized as in radiation trans-
fer. Then the collision term is in that case the sum of an
absorption term, an elastic scattering term and an emis-
sion term proportional to an equilibrium distribution9.
Many resolution technique have been developed in radi-
ation transfer such as the Discrete Ordinates Method,
the Monte Carlo method or the ray-tracing method10.
They can hardly be used when the collision processes are
inelastic as it is the case for electrons and phonons11.
For example, the phonons, which are eigenmodes of the
harmonic oscillators constituting the crystal, can only

interact through the anharmonic term of the potential
leading to three or more phonon collisions. These inter-
actions preserve neither the number of phonons nor their
frequency in the collision process. Nevertheless, these
three or four phonons interactions tend to restore thermal
equilibrium i.e. to help the phonons to follow an equi-
librium distribution function which can be easily deter-
mined from thermodynamic equilibrium considerations.
Thus, much of the studies modelize the collision term in
the BTE by the so-called Relaxation Time Approxima-
tion : the distribution function f (r, p, t) relaxes to an
equilibrium function f 0(r, p) on a time scale τ (p). The
BTE resulting from this approximation is nothing but the
Radiative Transfer Equation without scattering12. All
the numerical tools developed in thermal radiation can
therefore be used in this case. The key point in this model
is to calculate a suitable τ (p) in order to characterize the
collisions.

In the middle of the twentieth century, a great theo-
retical eﬀort has been done to modelized the relaxation
times of the phonons in a bulk material. At ambient
temperature, it has been shown that the main contri-
bution to the relaxation time ﬁnds its origin in the an-
harmonic phonon interaction. Two kinds of processes
can be identiﬁed. The so-called Normal processes (N )
which maintain the momentum in the collision and the
Umklapp processes (U ) which do not preserve the mo-
mentum. The former do not aﬀect the material ther-
mal resistance contrary to the latter. These Umklapp
processes follow selection rules13 and it is an amazing
feat to calculate them14. Actually, the relaxation times
are known for a small number of materials and often

in the bulk situations.
such as silicon (Si), germanium (Ge)15,16 and gallium ar-
senide (GaAs)17,18, the relaxation times have allowed to
compute semi-analytically thermal conductivities in good
agreement with measurements. Resolution of the BTE
have been achieved on these materials in bulk situations,
thin ﬁlm or superlattice conﬁguration12,19,20,21. At short
time scale, these resolutions have been compared to clas-
sical solutions22,23 and some modiﬁcations of the BTE
have been proposed24. The resolutions based on the Dis-
crete Ordinates Method or on the Finite Volumes Method
converge very quickly numerically but have a major draw-
back : they are governed by a single relaxation time tak-
ing into account all the diﬀerent processes of relaxation
such as the anharmonic interactions between phonons,
the interactions with impurities and dislocations or the
scattering on the material boundaries. The Matthiesen
rule which stands that the inverse of the total relaxation
term is the sum of the relaxation times due to every dif-
ferent phenomena is usually used. In the context of the
BTE in the relaxation time approximation, this means
that all the diﬀerent interaction or scattering phenom-
ena tends to restore thermal equilibrium.

An alternative way to solve the BTE is the Monte
Carlo method. This method is quite computer time
greedy because it necessitates to follow a large number

2

of energy carriers, but it becomes competitive when the
complexity of the problem increases, particularly for non-
trivial geometries. This method is therefore useful in or-
der to calculate the heat transfer in electronic devices of
any shape. Moreover, in this method, diﬀerent scattering
phenomena (impurities scattering, boundary scattering
and inelastic scattering) can be treated separately. The
resolution of the BTE by the Monte-Carlo method has
been performed for electrons25,26,27,28,29,30 but has been
little used in the case of phonons. Peterson31 performed
a Monte Carlo simulation for phonons in the Debye ap-
proximation with a single relaxation time. He presented
results both in the transient regime and in equilibrium
situation. Mazumder and Majumdar32 followed Peter-
son’s approach but included in their simulation the dis-
persion and the diﬀerent acoustic polarization branches.
They retrieved both the ballistic and the diﬀusion situa-
tion but did not show any result in the transient regime.
Another limit of this last paper is that the N processes
and the U processes are not treated separately although
they do not contribute in the same way to the conduc-
tivity.

The starting point in our work are these two contribu-
tions. We follow individual phonons in a space divided
into cells. The phonons after a drift phase are able to
interact and to be scattered. The speed and the rate at
which phonons scatter depends on the frequency. We en-
sure that energy is conserved after each scattering pro-
cess. This procedure is diﬀerent whether the phonons
interact through a N process or a U process. This paper
is therefore an improvement of existing phonon Monte
Carlo methods and is validated on simple examples such
as a semiconductor ﬁlm heated at two diﬀerent temper-
atures.

Section II recalls the basic hypothesis governing the
BTE. Fundamental quantities such as the number of
phonons, the energy and the density of states are also de-
ﬁned. The phonons properties are also presented through
their dispersion relations. Section III exposes the Monte
Carlo method used in this paper. Boundary conditions,
phonons drift and scattering procedures are given in de-
tails. Section IV present transient results in the diﬀusion
and ballistic regimes. Thermal conductivities of silicon
and germanium between 100 K and 500 K are numerically
estimated. Inﬂuence of conductivity thermal dependence
on heat conduction within a slab is studied. Finally, size
eﬀects on phonons transport at very short scales are con-
sidered.

II. THEORY

A. Boltzmann Transport Equation

The Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) is used to
model the phonons behavior in a crystal lattice. This
equation is related to the variation of the distribution
function f (t, r, K) which depends on time t, location r

and wave vector K. f (t, r, K) can also be deﬁned as the
mean particle number at time t in the d3r volume around
r with K wave vector and d3K accuracy. In the absence
of external force, the BTE expression is33

Integration of the distribution function over all the
wave vectors of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone and all the loca-
tions leads to the phonons number N (t) at a given time
in the crystal. The lhs term of Eq.(1) accounts for the
phonons drift in the medium and the rhs term for the
equilibrium restoration due to phonons collisions with
themselves, impurities and boundaries.

The collisional term modeling is the key point in the
BTE resolution. In the case of photons, it can be quite
easily modelized by an absorption term, an emission term
and an elastic scattering term in which a scattering phase
function relates a photon in the incoming and outgoing
propagation directions during a scattering event9. How-
ever, in the case of phonons, there is no absorption, nor
emission but only scattering events. Scattering events
at the borders can simply be treated during the drift
phase i.e. when a phonon reaches a border. Scattering
with impurities can be treated similarly to the isotropic
scattering of photons in thermal radiation. Scattering
of phonons due to the anharmonic terms of the poten-
tial are quite diﬃcult to modelize. We know nevertheless
that these terms are responsible of the thermal conduc-
tivity i.e. tend to restore thermal equilibrium. Therefore,
in this work we use the Relaxation Time Approximation
for three phonons scattering processes. The collision time
used in this formalism comes from Normal and Umklapp
relaxation times which are further estimated.

E is the material volumic energy. It is obtain by sum-
mation in Eq.(2) of each quantum ~ω over the two polar-
izations for transverse, longitudinal and optical modes of
phonons propagation. Assuming that the phonons wave
vectors are suﬃciently dense in the K-space, the summa-
tion over K can be replaced by an integral. Moreover,
using Dp(ω) the phonon density of state, we can achieve
the integration in the frequency domain. This two mod-
iﬁcations yield

B. Lattice modeling

C. Dispersion curves

As it has been exposed previously,

the thermal
behavior of the crystal can be considered from the
phonons characteristics (location, velocity and polar-
ization) within the medium. They might be obtained
through the BTE solution since the distribution function
can be easily related to the energy and therefore to the
temperature. Using an integrated distribution function,
one can express the total vibrational energy of the crystal

Only a few studies on that topic take into account dis-
persion.
Indeed, frequency dependence makes calcula-
tions longer accounting for velocity variation. However,
realistic simulation of phonons propagation through the
crystal must take into account interaction between the
diﬀerent branches. Here optical phonons are not consid-
ered because of their low group velocity : they do not con-
tribute signiﬁcantly to the heat transfer. Consequently
only transverse and longitudinal branches of silicon and
germanium are presented here (Fig. II C). We have made
the common isotropic assumption for wave vector and
consider the [001] direction in K-space. For silicon, we
used data obtained from a quadratic ﬁt29, whereas ger-
manium experimental curves35 have been ﬁtted by cubic
splines. Phonons group velocity has then been extracted
from this data. Note that in silicon an germanium, two
acoustic branches have been considered. The transverse
branch is degenerate (gT = 2) whereas the longitudinal
branch is non-degenerate (gL = 1).

III. MONTE CARLO METHOD

The Monte Carlo technique has been widely used in
order to solve transport equations. In the heat transfer
ﬁeld, Monte Carlo solutions of RTE are often considered
as reference benchmarks. The method accuracy only lies
on the number of sample used. Among others, the main
advantages of this technique are :

•

•

The simple treatment of transient problems,

The ability to consider complex geometries,

The possibility to follow independently each scat-
tering processes

The main drawback is computational time. However
this method remains a good choice between determinis-
tic approaches such as the Discrete Ordinates Method
(DOM) or ”exact solution” such as those provided by
molecular dynamic which is limited to very small struc-
tures.

A. Simulation domain and boundary conditions

As it was said before, the geometry of the studied ma-
terial does not matter. Here, a simple cubic cells stack
(Fig. III A) is considered since it can be readily related
to the plane wall geometry commonly used in thermal
problems. Cylindrical cells or multidimensional stacks
can be also considered in order to model nanowires or
real semi-conductors.

Concerning boundary conditions, we assume that the
lateral walls of the cells (in x and y directions) are spec-
ularly reﬂecting in most of the simulation cases. This

ity are randomly chosen in each cell according to dispersion
curves and local temperature.

means that walls are adiabatic and perfectly smooth.
Note also that in that case, the dimension in the x and y
directions should not change the result in the simulation.
Indeed, when reﬂection is specular on the lateral cells
boundaries, the momentum is preserved in the z direc-
tion. The heat ﬂux and the temperature along z should
thus not be aﬀected. At both end of the medium, tem-
perature is assumed to be constant. Therefore, energy in
the ﬁrst and the last cell is calculated from equilibrium
distribution functions. Incoming phonons in these cells
are thermalized at each time step. Consequently theses
cells act as blackbodies.

At this stage, an important point is the choice of the
three discretizations :
temporal, spatial and spectral.
Spatial discretization is directly related to the material
100 nm
geometry : usually cells length are about Lz ∼
for micrometric objects and can be smaller in the case
of thin ﬁlms or nanowires for instance. The time step
choice depends on two parameters : the cell size and the
group velocity at a given frequency. In order to consider
all scattering events and to avoid ballistic jump over sev-
eral cells, we state that the time step must be lower than
∆t < Lz/Vgmax.

The spectral discretization is uniform, we used Nb =
1000 spectral bins in the range [0, ωLAmax]. We have
checked that larger discretizations do not increase the
results accuracy.

B.

Initialization

The ﬁrst step of the simulation procedure, once
medium, geometry and mesh have been chosen, is to ini-
tialize the state of phonons within each cell describing the
material. Hence, the number of phonons present in each
cell is required. It will be obtained considering the local
temperature within the cell and using a modiﬁed expres-
sion of Eq. (6). In this equation, energy is given for all
the quanta ~ω associated to a spectral bin. Therefore, it
can be rewritten to give the total number of phonons in
a cell as

Hence, Peterson’s31 technique has been used. The actual

As a consequence, during the initialization, phonons
should be added by packs of W at a given frequency, sam-
pled from a normalized number density function F . Ac-
cording to Mazumder and Majumdar work32, this func-
tion is constructed doing the cumulative summation of
the number of phonons in the ith spectral bin over the
total number of phonons Eq.(7)

tribution and the density of states. For a given fre-
quency ωi, the number of phonon on each branch is:

A new random number R is drawn:
if R < PLA(ωi)
the phonon belongs to the LA branch otherwise it is a
transverse one.

The knowledge of the frequency and the polarization
leads to the estimation of the phonon group velocity
and the phonon wave vector merely using the dispersion
curves and their derivatives. Assuming isotropy within
the crystal, the direction Ω of the wave vector and the
group velocity are obtained from two random numbers R
and R′ in the Cartesian coordinates (i, j, k) associated
to lengths Lx, Ly and Lz. Hence Ω is written as

The last operation of the initialization procedure is to
give a random position to the phonon within the cell. In
the grid previously considered, location of the nth phonon
in the cell c is

rn,c = rc + LxR i + LyR′ j + LzR′′ k

(14)

where rc is the coordinates of the cell and R, R′ and R′′
three random numbers.

C. Drift

d

≤

Once the initialization stage is achieved, phonons are
allowed to drift inside the nanostructure. Considering the
time step ∆t and their velocities, each phonon position
is updated : rdrift = rold + vg∆t. In the case of shifting
outside of the lateral boundaries (in i and j directions)
the phonon is specularly reﬂected at the wall. In the case
of diﬀuse reﬂection with a particular degree d (0
1,
d = 0 purely specular, d = 1 purely diﬀuse) a random
number R is drawn. When R is lower than d a new
phonon propagation direction is calculated using Eq.(13).
When a phonon reaches the bottom (zmin) or the top
(zmax) of a cell, it is allowed to carry on its way in the
previous or next cell respectively. As a result, it is go-
ing to modify the cell energy and by extension its local
temperature. At the end of the drift phase, the actual en-
E⋆ is computed in all the cells using Eq.(9). Then,
ergy
T is obtained with Eq.(6) doing
the actual temperature
a Newton-Raphson inversion36. Phonons drifting in the
ﬁrst and last cellules are thermalized to the cold or hot
temperature in order to keep boundary cells acting as
blackbody sources.

D. Scattering

In the Monte Carlo simulation, the scattering pro-
cess has been treated independently from the drift. The
phonon-phonon scattering aims at restoring local ther-
mal equilibrium in the crystal since it changes phonons

frequency. Collisions with impurities or crystal defects as
well as boundary scattering do not change frequency but
solely the direction Ω. These last phenomena are signiﬁ-
cant when low temperatures are reached and the phonon
mean free path becomes large. Here only three-phonon
interactions have been considered.

As already said before, there are two kinds of three-
phonon processes : Normal processes (N ) which pre-
serve momentum and Umklapp processes (U ) which do
not preserve momentum by a reciprocal lattice vector.
These two mechanisms have consequences on the ther-
mal conductivity of the crystal. When the temperature
is suﬃciently high (T & TDebye), U processes become
signiﬁcant and directly modify heat propagation due to
the resistivity eﬀect on energy transport. On the other
hand, Normal scattering also aﬀects heat transfer since
it modiﬁes frequency distribution of the phonons. For
phonons described by (p, ω, K) and (p′, ω′, K′) scatter-
ing to (p′′, ω′′, K′′), the following relations are checked

(15)

where G is a lattice reciprocal vector. Scattering also in-
volves polarization in the way that acoustic transverse
and longitudinal phonons can interact. According to
Srivastava37 for N and U processes diﬀerent combina-
tions are possible

N and U processes : T + T ⇋ L and T + L ⇋ L
N processes only : T + T ⇋ T and L + L ⇋ L

(cid:26)

(16)
For the N processes only, all the participating phonons
must be collinear to achieve scattering. Usually these
interactions are neglected.

Direct simulation of phonons scattering is an awkward
challenge. With Monte Carlo simulations, it is possible
to modelize phonons collisions with neighbors as in the
gas kinetic theory calculating a three particles interac-
tion cross section. However, in the present study, the
frequency discretization might not be suﬃciently thin to
assess every three phonons processes. Thus the collisional
process is treated in the Relaxation Time Approximation.
Several studies on that topic have been carried out since
the early work of Klemens13, a detailed paper of Han and
Klemens38 recalled them.

Relaxation times τ have been proposed for several crys-
tals. They depend on the scattering processes, the tem-
perature and the frequency. Holland’s work on silicon16
and the recent study of Singh for germanium39 provide
various τ values. The independence of the scattering
processes is used to consider a global three phonons in-
verse relaxation times accounting for N and U processes
τN U .
It has been obtained using the Mathiessen rule
(τ −1

N U = τ −1
In order to be implemented in the Monte Carlo simu-
lation, the scattering routine requires an associated col-
lision probability Pscat. This one is derived saying that

with respect of energy and momentum conservation.

e

In previous studies on that topic,31,32 the frequency
sampling after collision was achieved from the normal-
ized number density function F at the actual tempera-
ture
T of the cell obtained at the end of the drift proce-
dure. In this approach the actual energy after the scat-
tering stage is usually diﬀerent from the ”target” one
obtained with temperature
T . Hence a subsequent ”cre-
ation/destruction” scheme is necessary to ensure energy
e
conservation. In fact, in the preceding procedure at ther-
mal equilibrium, the probability of destroying a phonon
of frequency ω and polarization p is diﬀerent from the
probability of creating this phonon. This means that the
Kirchhoﬀ law (creation balances destruction) is not re-
spected. In order to create phonons at the same rate they
are destroyed at thermal equilibrium, the distribution
function used to sample the frequencies of the phonons
after scattering has to be modulated by the probability
of scatterring. So we deﬁne a new distribution function

phonon on both transverse and longitudinal branches can
be resample with a not to weak energy as it can be seen
(Fig. III D).

harder to address since the Monte Carlo process consid-
ers phonons one by one. Consequently triadic N or U
interactions cannot be rigorously treated. In a ﬁrst ap-
proach, we propose the following procedure to take into
account the fact that U processes contribute to the ther-
mal resistance whereas the N processes do not. When
the phonons scatter through a U process, their directions
after scattering are randomly chosen as in the initializa-
tion procedure. Therefore, these phonons are randomly
scattered and contribute to the diﬀusion of heat. On the
contrary, it is assume that scattering phonons experienc-
ing a N process do not change their propagation direction
Ω.

Statistically, for a given temperature and frequency,
the phonons are destroyed by scattering at the same rate

7

they appear. A phonon which scatters has a great chance
to be replaced in the computation by a phonon of a near
frequency. Therefore, by this treatment, the N processes
”approximately” preserve momentum. Nevertheless, a
more accurate treatment should be done in order to re-
spect exactly the momentum in the N processes. For a
plan-parallel geometry, it seems possible to guarantee the
momentum conservation in a single direction.

In fact, the relaxation time estimation38 states that
there is a frequency limit ωlimit for the transverse acous-
tic branch. ωlimit actually corresponds to K = Kmax/2.
Below this limit frequency, there is no U processes. On
the other hand for ω > ωlimit, N processes are no longer
considered and the propagation direction must be resam-
pled in the case of a collision. In what concerns the longi-
tudinal acoustic branch, there is no limit frequency. Ac-
cording to Holland16 only N processes exist. However
applying this assumption implies that momentum has to
be conserved for each scattering event involving a LA
phonon. This leads to thermal conductivity values higher
than the theoretical ones for temperatures between 100
K and 250 K. In order to ensure a more realistic mo-
mentum conservation we set that half of the colliding
phonons keep their original Ω, the others (U processes)
are directionally resampled.

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Diﬀerent kinds of simulations have been performed so
as to check the computational method. Tests in both
diﬀusion and ballistic regimes are carried out for silicon
and germanium. Moreover, if small thermal gradients are
considered, one can estimate the thermal conductivity k
from the heat ﬂux through the structure. This has been
realized for Si and Ge between 100 K and 500 K.

Knowing that the conductivity varies with tempera-
ture according to a power law in the case of Si and Ge
for T greater than 100 K, it is obvious that a large ther-
mal gradient applied to our media should not bring a
purely linear solution. Hence simulations in this speciﬁc
case have been done. The model ability to correctly pre-
dict steady state has been conﬁrmed with comparison to
analytical solution.

Eventually, we studied size eﬀects on thermal behavior
It appears that the ballistic regime

can be retrieved at room temperature when the sample
size is close to the nanometer scale.

A. High temperature transient calculations

Concerning high temperature transient calculations,
the simulated case is described by the following parame-
ters :

290 K,

Both materials were tested. Germanium calculation re-
sults are presented here (Fig. IV A). In order to assess
the Monte Carlo solution, transient theoretical compari-
son exists in the case of the Fourier limit. Nevertheless,
it requires that the thermal diﬀusivity α remains con-
stant.
In the chosen temperature range, according to
the IOFFE database40, Ge thermal diﬀusivity is equal to
α = 0.36

10−4 m2s−1.

The considered test case has been described in ¨Ozi¸sik’s
book41 on heat conduction equation. Within the de-
scribed structure heat transfer is along z axis and an-
alytical solution for one-dimensional medium could be
obtained from integral transform. Temperature distribu-
tion in the slab is given by an inﬁnite sum that requires
enough terms in the case of short time calculation. How-
ever a simpler analytical solution might be obtained with
Laplace’s transform

The calculated values have been obtained from ten sim-
ulations averaged Fig. IV A, the random numbers seed
being reset for each computations. Monte Carlo model
ability to predict correctly temperature from the ﬁrst mo-
ments till steady state is clearly illustrated. The remain-
ing noise can be reduced with lower values of W weighting
factor. Diﬀusion regime is obtained after 30 ns. Similar
results are obtained for silicon, however the modelized
slab has to be larger (L = 4µm) because ballistic eﬀects
are observed near the cold limit. This point will be dis-
cussed latter.

B. Low temperature transient calculations

For low temperatures, heat transport inside the slab is
diﬀerent since phonons interactions change. In this case
U collisions are neglectibles and the only resistive pro-
cesses are assigned to impurities, defects and boundary
scattering. These phenomena have to be carefully exam-
ined in the case of thermal conductivity estimation be-
low 100 K. In fact, for very low temperatures the phonon
mean free path grows and becomes larger than the struc-
ture length. Hence, phonons can travel from hot to cold
extremity without colliding. This is the ballistic regime
similar to the one observed with photons exchanged be-
tween two black plates at diﬀerent temperatures42.
In
this peculiar case temperature in steady state is equal to
the following constant value

Results for silicon and germanium (Fig.IV B) give the
expected results for the ballistic limit. It can be noticed
that the current representation exhibits an artiﬁcial link
between black boundaries and the ﬁrst medium cell due
to the spatial discretization.
It can be seen that hot
phonons do not ﬂy straight toward the cold limit. More
than 1 ns is necessary to heat the last cell in the case of
silicon. This is in agreement with velocities prescribed
by dispersion curves. Heat propagation in germanium is
slower since phonons group speed is also lower. Results
at low temperatures obtained with our method have been
already be predicted by Joshi and Majumdar22 in similar
cases, who applied successfully the Equation of Phonon
Radiative Transfer (EPRT) in ballistic regime.

C. Si and Ge thermal conductivities

There are several ways to perform the thermal con-
ductivity calculation of a semiconductor. Among these
techniques, Holland’s method16 based on phonons kinetic
theory was largely employed. Molecular dynamic simu-
lations can be also used to obtain k. In the present study
thermal conductivity has been determined knowing the
heat ﬂux (phonon energy transport) through the medium
for a given thermal gradient directly applying Fourier’s
law. As in Mazumder’s work32, the temperature diﬀer-
ence between hot ans cold extremities is set to 20 K so
as to determine average conductivities. The phonon heat
ﬂux is calculated along z axis according to the following
relation

(22)

Simulations have been carried on between 100 K and

500 K (Fig.IV C) on 2 µm thick samples.

Comparison of the Monte Carlo calculated conductiv-
ities is achieved with bulk data. Solid and dash curves
are linear power law regression of theoretical data in the
considered thermal range. These values are used in next
analytical calculations. We have appraised for 200 K

is large enough to assume the acoustic thick limit. Fur-
thermore, this calcul beneﬁts from recent relaxation time
estimation which have been ﬁxed with a good precision39.
The inﬂuence of these factors on calculated conductivity
is usually strong. Silicon results are also close to the bulk
ones till 150 K where the relative error is equal to 7%.
For lower temperatures, discrepancy between theory and
simulation increases. This gap can be assigned to size
eﬀects since phonon mean free path grows when temper-
ature is falling. Here, it becomes similar to the slab size.
Yet, if we refer to Asheghi44 work on thin ﬁlms thermal
conductivity, at temperatures below 100 K, signiﬁcantly
decreases in comparison with bulk due to stronger reduc-
tion of phonon mean free path by boundaries. Actually
for pure 3 µm silicon ﬁlm thermal conductivity is close to
600 Wm−1K−1 at 100 K44. This value is comparable to
the 658 Wm−1K−1 obtained for our 2 µm ﬁlm by Monte
Carlo simulation.

D. Eﬀect of non linear conductivity

In this fourth part, transient simulations with samples
heated under a large thermal step have been conducted.
The purpose of such calculations was to underling the
model capacity to correctly predict steady state when
medium properties (k(T )) vary with temperature. In the
previous part thermal conductivities of both bulk materi-
als have been estimated with a power law Eq.(23). Hence,
the analytic solution for temperature proﬁle within a slab
can be easily determined in steady state by the resolution
of a ﬁrst order diﬀerential equation as

For germanium a very good agreement is obtained with
bulk values in the whole temperature domain. The max-
imum relative error being under 8%. In this case, at 100
K, phonon mean free path is lower to the micrometer
according to Dames43. Consequently the stucture size

used. The initial geometry is kept for germanium slab.
Temperatures are now : Th = 500 K and Tc = 250 K.
Time step remains equal to 5 ps. In both cases (Fig.IV D)
Monte Carlo simulations give a very good estimation of
the steady state behavior. Results are averaged over ﬁve
computations on the last 1000 time steps (i.e. after 45 ns
of elapsed time). At the cold limit of germanium sample a
weak deviation exits between simulation and theory. The
relative error on temperature remains smaller than 1.5%,
in this area. This mismatch could be assigned to bound-
ary eﬀects, associating diﬀusive and ballistic regimes near
the limits as we will detailled it in the last part. It could
also be due to the accuracy of the bulk thermal conduc-
tivity ﬁtting at low temperatures.

The temperature proﬁle gets closer to the ballistic limit
for sample size around the nanometer scale. Neverthe-
less, this approximately represents ten atom layers and
therefore might encounter the modelization limitation.
On the contrary, in a silicon sample thicker than 4 µm,
temperature reaches the Fourier’s regime and can be sim-
ilarly obtained with heat conduction equation at least
cost.

E. Size eﬀect on heat diﬀusion

V. CONCLUSIONS

From the previous calculations, it is obvious that the
phonon mean free path modiﬁcation with the tempera-
ture acts as a major factor in heat conduction. So, if
the structure size is adjusted in order to match the mean
free path at any temperature, ballistic phenomena should
be observed. In this study only silicon is used and the
simulation parameters are

An improved Monte Carlo scheme that allows transient
heat transfer calculations at time and space nanoscales,
on the basis of phonons transport, has been presented.
This model accounts for phonons transitions between lon-
gitudinal and transverse acoustic branches and can be
simply applied to several semiconductors if their disper-
sion relations are known. A particular attention has been
paid to the energy and momentum conservation during
collision process.

Numerical results forecast have been assessed in diﬀer-
ent heat transfer modes. In slab conﬁguration, a good
agreement was found for both extreme phonon motion
which are the diﬀusive and ballistic ones. Bulk thermal
conductivities of silicon and germanium have been nu-
merically retrieved with a maximal error lower than 8%.

Besides, our Monte Carlo model correctly predict tem-
perature proﬁle in more peculiar situations, when strong
thermal gradient or very small sizes are encountered.

Nevertheless some key points need to be reﬁned.
Among them momentum conservation procedure might
be improved, especially for one dimensional applications.
Optical phonons eﬀect on heat transport were neglected.
However according to the recent study of Narumanchi23
they must be taken into account especially for capaci-
tive properties prediction. Regarding the collision pro-
cess, improvements might be expected. Using theoret-
ical values of τ recalled by Han and Klemens38, direct
calculation of phonon scattering relaxation time can be
realized in each authorized spectral bin. Hence, a more

11

realistic approach of three phonons interactions should
be achieved.

We are currently working on this improvements but
also on other potential implementation of the method
such as those related to the superlattices and the
nanowires.

Radiation Reaction ﬁelds for an accelerated dipole for scalar and
electromagnetic radiation

Abstract

The radiation reaction ﬁelds are calculated for an accelerated changing dipole
in scalar and electromagnetic radiation ﬁelds. The acceleration reaction is
shown to alter the damping of a time varying dipole in the EM case, but not
the scalar case. In the EM case, the dipole radiation reactionﬁeld can exert
a force on an accelerated monopole charge associated with the accelerated
dipole. The radiation reaction of an accelerated charge does not exert a torque
on an accelerated magnetic dipole, but an accelerated dipole does exert a force
on the charge. The technique used is that originally developed by Penrose for
non-singular ﬁelds and extended by the author for an accelerated monopole
charge.

It is well known that an accelerated charge radiates and that the emitted ﬁeld from the
accelerated charge exerts a force ( the radiation reaction force) back on the charge itself.
This radiation reaction force is usually derived either by an appeal to a balance of the
energy and momentum emitted by the charge or by a detailed examination of the energy-
momentum tensor just near the charge. These techniques invariably have diﬃculties with the
fact that the ﬁelds from a point charge diverge, and necessitate re-normalisation of various
quantities (eg the mass) in order to extract reasonable results. However, it was discovered
by Penrose and Unruh that the radiation reaction ﬁeld for a charge could be extracted from
the radiation ﬁeld by means of an integral over the future null cone of the the particle. This
integral, which in the absence of any sources, exactly gives the ﬁeld strength at a point, also
gives a ﬁnite result whan applied to the ﬁeld emanating from a point charge, and that ﬁnite
result is exactly the radiation reaction ﬁelds at the particle. In this paper I will show that
this approach can be generalised to the case of an accelerating dipole and leads to ﬁnite
radiation reaction ﬁelds at the location of the point dipole. These ﬁelds lead to the damping
forces on that accelerating dipole. These results will ultimately be applied in another paper
on the question of the equilibrium polarisation of an accelerating particle with spin, but
seem to be of suﬃcient general interest that they are here separated out for detailed study.
In this paper, I will derive the radiation reaction ﬁelds at the location of point source for
a massless scalar ﬁeld, and the reaction ﬁelds at the location of a point dipole source for the
electromagnetic ﬁeld, using the Penrose integral to do so. Thus I will begin by giving a very
brief review of the Newmann-Penrose (NP) spinor formalism, and the natural null tetrad
metric for an accelerated path in Minkowski spacetime. That accelerated path is assumed

1

for the purposes of this paper to consist of an acceleration restricted to a plane (linear or
circular acceleration, but with non-constant acceleration).

I. NULL METRIC, TETRAD AND NP SPIN FORMALISM

This section will be a very quick review of the NP spinor formalism, presented as much
to specify the notation I will use as for any other purpose. For a more complete introduction
to spinors, see Penrose and Rindler [2]

Given a path in spacetime, deﬁne a urθφ coordinate system as follows:
Parameterize the curve by its length parameter u. (ie, ηµν

dXν
du = 1). At each point
along the curve, deﬁne the future directed null cone centered at that point along the curve,
and label that null cone by the parameter u.

dxµ
du

On each of the null cones, choose the direction of the acceleration vector, and call it the
θ = 0 direction. Along each of the null generators of the cone (null lines which originate
at the point along the curve at the vertex of the cone) deﬁne a radial aﬃne parameter r,
such that the tangent vector nµ to the null curve parameterized by r (which is a null vector)
has a dot product with the tangent vector to the original curve of unity– Ie, nµ dxµ
du = 1.
Now, the two spheres deﬁned by u and r constant are metric two spheres on which we
will deﬁne angular coordinates θ and φ. They are chosen so that the metric on these two
spheres is the usual two sphere metrics.. Because of the way that r has been deﬁned, the
circumference of these two spheres will be r so the metric on these two spheres will be
r2(dθ2 + dφ2). The direction θ = 0 is at the null generator pointing in the direction of the
acceleration vector, and θ and φ will label the null generators. This procedure will deﬁne a
new coordinate system centered on the path of the particle. The metric of ﬂat spacetime in
these coordinates is

ds2 =

1 + 2f (u)r cos(θ)
(cid:16)
+2dudr + 2(f (u) sin(θ) + g(u) cos(φ))r2dudθ

where f (u) and g(u) will be related to the acceleration. f (u) is the acceleration, and g(u)
is the rate of change of the direction of the acceleration. The acceleration is assumed to be
conﬁned to the place φ = 0 or π.

We now deﬁne a null complex tetrad for this metric. This is a set of four vectors lµ, nµ,
mµ and ¯mµ such that each of these vectors is null (has zero inner product with itself) and
such that

(1)

(2)

lµnµ = mµ ¯mµ = 1

and all other inner products are zero. The vector nµ has already been deﬁned as the vector
tangent to the null generators of the null cones. The vector mµ is deﬁned as a complex
vector lying tangent to the two surface of the u and r constant spheres. ¯mµ is the complex
conjugate to µ. Thus the null vector lµ will be orthogonal to the these two spheres (as is
nµ). lµ is assumed to be such that lµ dXµ
du is greater than zero (ie, is a future pointing null
vector.) For deﬁniteness, I will choose mµ = eµ
φ where eθ and eφ are the unit vectors
which lie along the u, r, φ constant line and u, r, θ constant lines respectively.

In addition to the null vectors, the formalism deﬁnes a set of two dimensional complex
spinors.
In particular they assumed that there are two separate two dimensional spinor
spaces which are anti-unitarily related to each other (these are just the two unitarily in-
equivalent spin 1/2 representations of the Lorentz group). Tensors over these two spaces
are designated by indexed symbols whose indices are capital Roman letters. Tensors over
the one representation have plain indices and tensors over the other are designated with
primes on their indices. Because of their anti-unitary relationship, there exists a mapping
from one type of tensor to the other, which we will denote by complex conjugation. Thus
(wA)∗ = ¯wA′
. This is deﬁned so that the inner product of complex conjugate vectors is
just the ordinary complex conjugation. (wAvA)∗ = ¯wA′
¯vA′. A complete set of basis vec-
tors on these spinor spaces are designated by ιA, oA in the one case, and ιA′
in the
other case.They are chosen so that (ιA)∗ = ιA′
, etc. These spinor spaces are related to the
spacetime vectors by means of the spin matrices σµ
AA′, matrices which for a given vector vµ
represent a mapping from the one spinor space to the other via Vµσµ
AA′. If we choose the
basis vectors appropriately in the spinor space, then these matrices are just the four Pauli
spin matrices,1, σx, σy, σz. In particular I will assume that they are chosen so that

, oA′

with ιA and ιA′ both represented by (0, 1) and oA and oA′ both represented by (1, 0). Thus,
we have

lµσµ = (1 + σz)/2

From now on I will freely alternate between the spinor representation and the vector

representation. Thus a tensor Sµν can also be written as SAA′BB′ = Sµνσµ

AA′σν

BB′, etc.

These spinor spaces also have a metric deﬁned on them, a metric which must be compat-
ible with the Lorentzian metric. The metric, designated by either ǫAB for the spinor, or ǫA′B′
ǫBA. The inverse
for the anti-spinor space is an antisymmetric metric, such that ǫAB =

−

3

metric is ǫAB which is also antisymmetric and is chosen so that ǫABǫCB = δC
A . Indices are
raised and lowered by means of the metric, but because of the antisymmetry of the metric,
the order of the indices is of crucial importance. My convention, following Penrose and
Rindler [2], is

ωA = ǫABωB =

ωBǫBA
−
ωA = ωBǫBA.

(15)
(16)

and similarly for the prime space. The basis vectors ιA and oA are chosen to obey oAιA = 1,
which is compatible with the relation of these spinor bases to the spacetime null tetrad, and
the normalisation of those tetrad vectors.

This antisymmetry of the metric and the attendant risk of confusion in index manip-
ulations (together with the presence of the two separate types of spinors) is probably the
greatest impediment to the adoption of spinors as a standard approach in special and general
relativity. Given these disadvantages, there must be some advantages to the spinor formal-
ism which would persuade any but masochists to adopt the formalism. The key advantages
are ﬁrstly that spinors allows a uniﬁed treatment of the various ﬁelds of whatever spin type
in one simple notational system. Ie, scalar, spin 1/2, vector, spin 3/2, .... ﬁelds can all be
treated very similarly, in an extremely compact and transparent way. The second advantage
is that spinor space is a two dimensional space. This means that there is only antisymmetric
tensor of rank two, and all other antisymmetric tensors of rank two must be proportional to
this tensor. Furthermore, since the metric is antisymmetric, it can be chosen as the ﬁducial
antisymmetric tensor. Any two indices (of the same type) of a spinor tensor can always be
written as a combination of symmetric and antisymmetric pairs. Thus, we can write any
tensor

S...A..B..

...

= S...(A|..|B)..

...

+

ǫCDS....C..D..
...

ǫAB

(17)

Any tensor can thus be written as the sum of tensors which are totally symmetric on their
indices times products of the metric tensors. This ability to represent any tensor as either
entirely symmetric tensors or multiples of the metric is the key power of the spinor notation,
and achieves its greatest power in the representation of massless ﬁelds. A massless ﬁeld of
spin s is represented by a tensor with s indices, all of which are completely symmetric, say
ΨAB..S where the tensor is symmetric under interchange of any two indices. Furthermore,
the equations of motion of a spin s massless ﬁeld are simply written as
ΨAB...S = 0,
∇AA′ is the covariant derivative, deﬁned on spinors such that σµ
AA′ and the metric ǫAB
where
are covariantly constant. It is the compactness of the spinor notation, and the transparency
of the symmetries of the fundamental tensors which give the spinor notation its power.

In the following I will be primarily interested in the electromagnetic ﬁeld, F µν. Writ-
ing this in spinor form, we have FAA′BB′ with the antisymmetry ensuring that FAA′BB′ =

FBB′AA′. But using the above reduction, we note that this can be written as

where J µ is the current source for the Maxwell ﬁeld. The reality of Fµν and Jµ ensure that
(FAB)∗ = FA′B′ and (JAB′)∗ = JBA′.

Finally, if Gµν is another antisymmetric tensor, then

F µνGµν = 2(F ABGAB + F A′B′

and if F and G are both real tensors, then

F ABGAB = (F A′B′

GA′B′)∗

Having established the notation, I will now state the theorem without proof [1,2]. Given
a spin s massless ﬁeld without source, then the following integral gives the value of the ﬁeld
Ψ(0)AB...S at the apex (r=0) of the null cone emanating from a point in spacetime.

∇XX′TAB..S = 0. (In fact it need only
Here TAB..S is any covariantly constant spinor ﬁeld,
be covariantly constant along the null cone of interest). This theorem states that the value
of any massless ﬁeld in ﬂat spacetime can be determined by the integral over a sphere on
the null cone emanating from that point. This expression is a generalisation to a dynamic
massless ﬁeld of arbitrary spin of the Kirkoﬀ type integrals for static ﬁelds in terms of the
integral over some surface surrounding the point in question of the normal derivatives of the
ﬁeld and the Green’s function for that ﬁeld.

Although I have stated the theorem in terms of integrals over metric spheres on the null
cone (r =const.), it can also be generalised to the integral over arbitrary two surfaces on the
null cone. However, I will not use that generalisation here.

While the use of this integral for the value of the ﬁeld at points in the spacetime where the
ﬁeld is regular is interesting but unexceptional, a surprising result [1] is that this integral
also gives ﬁnite values if the point of interest is the location of a point charge (with its
divergent Coulomb ﬁeld). In fact, this integral (or rather the average of this integral over
the future null cone emanating from the location of that charge at some time, and the past
directed null cone emanating from that same point) gives exactly the radiation reaction ﬁeld
for an accelerating charge.

where the square brackets around the indices indicates anti-symmetrization, (S[µν] = 1
−
Sνµ). Ie, this Penrose integral automatically averages out the divergent ﬁeld of the point
particle to give just the ﬁnite radiation reaction contribution. Thus this Penrose integral
approach diﬀers substantially from techniques like the Dirac [3] or Abraham–Lorentz [4]
which suﬀer from divergences and the necessity for re-normalisations.

2(Sµν

The purpose of this paper will be to apply the above formula to the calculation of
the radiation reaction ﬁeld of an accelerating and time varying point dipole source for the
electromagnetic ﬁeld. Surprisingly, considering the fact the ”Coulomb” portion of the ﬁeld
now diverges as 1/r3 rather than as 1/r2 for the case of a point charge, the Penrose integral is
still ﬁnite, and gives a ﬁeld which agrees with the radiation reaction ﬁeld for a time varying
unaccelerated dipole calculated by other methods [6]. I will therefor assume that this ﬁnite
ﬁeld is also the correct radiation reaction ﬁeld for an accelerated dipole. I have so far been
unable to prove that this is consistent with the radiation damping one would calculate by
more traditional techniques (eg, from the energy momentum tensor), but I can see no reason
why it would not.

II. SCALAR FIELD

In order to gain practice, let me ﬁrst calculate the radiation reaction ﬁeld produced by
a source which radiates scalar radiation. Consider a scalar ﬁeld coupled to a point source
travelling along the line xµ(u) in ﬂat spacetime, with a time varying source for the scalar
ﬁeld of intensity m(u), The Lagrangian for the massless scalar ﬁeld is assumed to be

S =

In the urθφ coordinates, the retarded Green’s function for the scalar ﬁeld in urθφ coordinates
is particularly simple, it is just 1/r. Thus the retarded solution for the scalar ﬁeld is just

We can now substitute this expression into the equation for the radiation reaction ﬁeld. In
order to write this in a slightly more transparent form, recall that lAA′

ing coeﬃcient 2ǫ2. In another paper I will use this to investigate the emission of radiation
from an accelerating detector in interaction with the scalar ﬁeld.

III. ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION REACTION FIELDS

One of the most interesting features of the radiation reaction ﬁeld is that an accelerated
magnetic dipole will have an electric component to its radiation reaction ﬁeld. Thus, if the
point dipole also has a non-zero charge, then the accelerated dipole will exert a force on
that accelerated charge in addition to the normal radiation reaction force from the charge
itself. On the other hand, since the radiation reaction ﬁeld for an accelerated charge has no
magnetic component in the rest frame of that charge, the accelerated charge will not alter
the motion of the magnetic dipole moment.

If the magnetic dipole moment is proportional to the angular momentum, via the mag-
netic moment, µ of the point charge distribution, then the equation of motion for the dipole
moment under constant magnitude of acceleration is

This solution is subject to runaway behaviour just as is the accelerated charge. In this
case the runaway behaviour is in the direction in which the angular momentum points,
the angular momentum itself of course being conserved by the above equation. Choosing
coordinates θφ such that the B0 points in the direction of θ = 0, and the magnetic moment
vector points in the direction Θ(u), Φ(u), and choosing g(u) = 0, F (u) constant, the
equation of motion for Θ, Φ are

in providing the lowest order corrections to the solution, and cannot be taken seriously as a
complete solution.

Abstract

For a multicomponent wave ﬁeld propagating into a multidimensional con-

version region, the rays are shown to be helical, in general. For a ray-based

quantity to have a fundamental physical meaning it must be invariant under

two groups of transformations: congruence transformations (which shuﬄe

components of the multi-component wave ﬁeld) and canonical transforma-

tions (which act on the ray phase space).

It is shown that for conversion

between two waves there is a new invariant not previously discussed: the

intrinsic helicity of the ray.

For linear propagation of an N-component wave ﬁeld in a (weakly) non-uniform multi-

dimensional medium, the ﬁeld is usefully represented by a family of rays, along which the

wave phase, amplitude, and polarization propagate. (The theory is referred to as ray-tracing,

WKB, or eikonal.) In a local region where two waves of diﬀerent polarization have (nearly)

the same frequency and wave-vector, resonant conversion occurs, and a ray of one wave splits

into two rays, one of each type. In a conversion region, the WKB theory breaks down and a

local theory must be developed which governs the pairwise interaction of the two resonant

waves. Such a theory is represented by a 2 × 2 local wave equation.

The ray equations are Hamiltonian with the determinant of the full N ×N dispersion ma-

trix playing the role of the Hamiltonian. In a conversion region, the local ray geometry can

be used to guide the reduction from the original N × N theory to the local 2 × 2 form [1,2],

construct the local transformations which recasts the local 2 × 2 wave equation into the

simplest possible form, and ﬁnd the local coordinates in which the 2 × 2 wave equation sepa-

rates. The new results reported here are: 1) In a conversion region, the six-dimensional ray

phase space is locally foliated by four-dimensional invariant subspaces. Within these four-

dimensional subspaces, the ray dynamics is hyperbolic in one two-dimensional subspace, and

elliptic in the other (i.e. pure hyperbolic motion is not possible). 2) There is one quantity,

not previously identiﬁed, that is invariant under all local congruence transformations and

canonical transformations: the ray helicity.

Linear wave conversion is ubiquitous throughout physics (see, for example, references

given in [2,3]). While there is a large literature on conversion in one dimension, there are

relatively few studies of the multi-dimensional case (see Refs. [4–14] in physics, and [15–17]

in mathematics).

We start with a general N-component ﬁeld Ψ = (ψ1, ψ2, . . . , ψN ) in a weakly non-uniform

medium. Assume the medium has three spatial dimensions for concreteness and is time-

stationary, but note that the methods described can be extended to include non-stationary

media as well [18]. Denote a point in space as x = (x1, x2, x3). The wave equation can

2

always be cast into the standard form [6]:

d3x′dt′Dmn(x, x′, t − t′)ψn(x′, t′) = 0, m = 1, 2 . . . N.

We assume that the wave kernel D is an N × N matrix-valued fuction of its arguments

satisfying Dmn(x, x′, t−t′) = D∗

nm(x′, x, t′−t), which gives non-dissipative wave propagation.

The goal is to ﬁnd the multi-component ﬁeld Ψ(x, t) throughout a given space-time region

with ﬁtting to appropriate initial/boundary conditions. A standard tool for this analysis is

the eikonal, or WKB, method. An ansatz is used of the form Ψ(x, t) = eiθ(x)−iωt ˜ψ(x)ˆe(x),

where θ(x) is a rapidly varying phase, ˜ψ(x) is a slowly varying scalar amplitude function

(assumed real), and ˆe(x) is a slowly varying (complex) polarization vector. The WKB

approximation breaks down near caustics and in conversion regions. The theory of caustics

is well-developed [19,20], while the conversion problem in multi-dimensions is our present

concern.

Starting with the wave kernel and using the Weyl calculus [12,18,21,22], we next con-

struct the dispersion matrix, an N × N matrix-valued function on the ray phase space

denoted D(x, k). From now on we denote a point in the six-dimensional ray phase space

by z ≡ (x, k) = (z1, z2, z3, z4, z5, z6).

If (1) is conservative (as we assume), then D(z) is

Hermitian at each point z: D†(z) = D(z). Ray propagation requires D(z) ≡ det(D) = 0.

This single scalar condition upon the six coordinates z deﬁnes the dispersion surface which

is, generically, a smooth ﬁve-dimensional surface, though it may have local singularities.

Conversion occurs in the vicinity of the spatial point x∗ where two diﬀerent WKB waves

of frequency ω, with distinct polarization and dispersion characteristics, have nearly equal

wavevectors [2]. In the ray phase space, this requires that two branches of the dispersion

surface are in close proximity near the point z∗ = (x∗, k∗).

Away from conversion regions (and caustics), the amplitude and polarization vary slowly

following a ray. Within conversion regions, however, the polarization and amplitude vary

rapidly and the WKB ansatz is no longer valid.

Instead, the ﬁeld locally has the form

Ψ(x, t) = eik∗·(x−x∗)−iωt [ψα(x)ˆeα + ψβ(x)ˆeβ], where ˆeα and ˆeβ are the uncoupled polariza-

3

tions evaluated at the conversion point. The algorithm for ﬁnding these two constant polar-

ization vectors has been discussed elsewhere (see [6,8] for a proposed algorithm). We assume

the uncoupled polarizations are given. The complex scalar amplitude functions, ψα and ψβ,

include all the eﬀects of the coupling and have rapid variation in both amplitude and phase

in the conversion region, but (after multiplication by exp[ik∗ · (x − x∗) − iωt]) they connect

smoothly onto the incoming and outgoing WKB wavefunctions.

The uncoupled polarizations are used to reduce the full N × N dispersion matrix to the

following 2 × 2 reduced dispersion matrix

D(z) =

Dαα(z) Dαβ(z)

D∗

αβ(z) Dββ(z)













with Djk(z) ≡ ˆe†

j · D(z) · ˆek j, k = (α, β). We now consider only the reduced dispersion

matrix (which is also Hermitian). Following Littlejohn and Flynn [3,11,23], we use the fact

that any 2 × 2 Hermitian matrix can be expanded using the Pauli matrices as a basis:

D(z) ≡ Bµ(z)σµ =

B0(z) + B3(z) B1(z) + iB2(z)

B1(z) − iB2(z) B0(z) − B3(z)







.







Here, the components of the ‘four-vector’ B = (B0, B1, B2, B3) are real scalar functions of z

which are assumed to be independent in the region of interest. Taking the determinant gives

det(D) = B2

0 −B2

1 −B2

2 −B2

3 = ηµνBµBν, with the Minkowski tensor η ≡ diag(1, −1, −1, −1).

Note that det(D) = 0 implies that B must lie on the ‘light’ cone in ‘B-space’.

Rays are propagated on the dispersion surface using D(z) = BµBµ(z) as the ray

Hamiltonian. Hamilton’s equations are most compactly written in terms of the Poisson

bracket. For any two scalar functions, f (z) and g(z), the Poisson bracket is deﬁned to be

{f, g} ≡ ∇zf · J · ∇zg where the 6 × 6 matrix J is deﬁned as

with ‘0’ and ‘1’ the 3 × 3 null and identity matrices, respectively. The ray Hamiltonian D(z)

generates the ray evolution equations via:

Thus,

˙x = −∇kD and ˙k = ∇xD. Following a ray, any scalar function f (z) changes as

˙f = {D, f } = {ηνρBνBρ, f }. In particular, the coordinates in ‘B-space’ change as

˙z ≡

(6)

Here Ων

µ = ηνρΩρµ is a 4 × 4 matrix composed of all pairwise Poisson brackets of the compo-

nents Bµ(z): Ωρµ(z) ≡ {Bρ, Bµ} = −{Bµ, Bρ}. The matrix Ω plays a fundamental role in the

theory; since all of its entries are Poisson brackets, the entire matrix is invariant under canon-

ical transformations. Inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformations are generated by anti-symmetric

matrices (meaning that the 4 × 4 matrix Λ(σ) = 1 + σηΩ satisﬁes ˜Λ(σ)ηΛ(σ) = η + O(σ2)).

Hence, we can associate a one-parameter family of Lorentz transformations with the ray

propagation. The key idea is that the equations (6) are simply Hamilton’s equations writ-

ten in a non-canonical coordinate system. (Recalling that phase space is six-dimensional,

and there are only four Bµ, we must supplement (6) by two further evolution equations for

another pair of coordinates, as will be shown.) Note also that, when B → B′ = AB for any

constant linear transformation A (not just a Lorentz transformation), the matrix of Poisson

brackets Ω transforms via Ω′ = AΩ ˜A.

The geometrical picture is as follows (see Figure (1)):

the ray phase space is six-

dimensional and plays the role of the base space. Over each point z there is a ﬁber consisting

of the space of 2 × 2 Hermitian matrices (‘D-space’). Equivalently, the ﬁber consists of the

space of four-vectors B (‘B-space’). The ﬁber space is four-dimensional. For each z, assign

a particular D(z) and assume that this assignment changes smoothly as we vary the base

point z. This assignment deﬁnes a six-dimensional surface, denoted S. We note that a ray

trajectory in the phase space (a solution of (5)) is associated with a well-deﬁned curve in S

and, hence, with a well-deﬁned curve in the ﬁber space. This curve obeys (6) in B-space.

The mapping between the six-dimensional section S and the six-dimensional ray phase

space is smooth and one-to-one. However, the mapping from S to the four-dimensional D-

5

and B-spaces cannot be one-to-one. This can be clariﬁed by an appropriate choice of local

coordinates. We have assumed that the four components Bµ(z) are locally independent func-

tions of z, hence we can use them as four local (non-canonical) coordinates in the ray phase

space. These are supplemented by two further independent coordinates, call them F1(z) and

F2(z). We can choose F1 and F2 to satisfy {F1, Bµ} = {F2, Bµ} = 0, µ = 0, . . . 3, but F1

and F2 are otherwise arbitrary (note that this implies {F1, F2} 6= 0). This gives us a local

six-dimensional (non-canonical) coordinate system (B0(z), B1(z), B2(z), B3(z), F1(z), F2(z)).

The B-coordinates change via (6), while the F1 and F2 do not change along the ray since

they have zero Poisson bracket with the Bµ’s. This implies that the rays lie in surfaces of

constant (F1, F2) and, therefore, there is a natural foliation of the six-dimensional phase

space, with each four-dimensional leaf labeled by the two invariants F1 and F2. Within each

four-dimensional leaf, the three-dimensional image of the light cone BµBµ(z) = 0 is a slice

of the dispersion surface D(z) = 0. Note that we do not need to assume that we are near

the apex of this cone, nor have we linearized the coordinate functions. These properties of

the local ray dynamics are purely a consequence of the fact that the ray Hamiltonian is the

determinant of a generic 2 × 2 Hermitian matrix.

We now ﬁx attention upon a particular leaf (i.e. ﬁxed values of (F1, F2)). After restricting

to a ﬁxed leaf, the ray motion can either be viewed in the phase space (where the ray

equations (5) are canonical), or in B-space (where the ray equations (6) are non-canonical).

Extracting the geometrical invariants, and their physical implications, is more direct using

the non-canonical coordinates.

Under a congruence transformation Q with constant entries, the 2 ×2 reduced dispersion

matrix transforms via D → D′ ≡ Q† · D · Q, and the determinant as det(D′) = Q2det(D)

where det(Q) ≡ Q. First consider Q with unit determinant, Q = 1. Direct calculation shows

that the related four-vector B and matrix Ω transform to B′

ν = Λµ

ν Bµ and Ω′ = ΛΩ˜Λ, re-

spectively, where Λ is the 4×4 Lorentz matrix with entries [11,21] (Λ−1)µ

Notice that two Q’s that diﬀer by an overall minus sign are related to the same Lorentz

transformation.

The Lorentz transformations leave the Minkowski tensor η invariant ˜ΛηΛ = η. The

Minkowski tensor satisﬁes η2 = 1, implying that Λ−1 = η ˜Λη. Therefore, ηΩ transforms

via the similarity transformation ηΩ′ = ˜Λ−1 (ηΩ) ˜Λ, and its characteristic polynomial is

invariant under Lorentz transformations. Some algebra shows that P (λ) = det(ηΩ − λ) =

λ4 − 1

2tr((ηΩ)2)λ2 + det(ηΩ). If we use the standard parametrization for generators of the

Lorentz group [24]:

Ω ≡

(7)

then we ﬁnd P (λ) = λ4 + (ω2 − γ2)λ2 − (γ · ω)2. Notice that P (λ) depends only upon λ2,

hence the roots of P (λ) = 0 come in plus-minus pairs. Generically, P (0) is strictly negative,

while P (λ2) is concave upward as a function of λ2. Therefore, as a function of λ2, P = 0

will have one negative root and one positive root. This implies, in turn, that as a function

of λ, P = 0 will have a pair of ± pure imaginary roots, and a pair of ± real roots. This

implies that the ray motion will be a combination of elliptic and hyperbolic behaviors.

This parametrization (7) provides a useful physical interpretation for the meaning of Ω.

Fix a point z = z0 on the ray where Ω0 ≡ Ω(z0) is evaluated. Now use Ω0 to generate a

one-parameter family of Lorentz transformations in B-space (σ is the ray orbit parameter)

B(σ) = Λ(σ)B(0) ≡ exp(σηΩ0)B(0). This provides a local approximation to the ray orbit

in B-space. In that space, the ray evolution will be a combination of a rotation (generated

by the ω-subspace) and a ‘boost’, generated by the γ-subspace [24]. Hence, the orbit in

B-space will generically be a combination of elliptic and hyperbolic motions. But, a ray

orbit in B-space is the smooth image of a ray orbit in the original phase space, hence ray

orbits generated by generic 2 × 2 dispersion matrices will have a combination of elliptic and

hyperbolic motions. Purely hyperbolic motion is not possible.

The above discussion demonstrates that ray dynamics in a multi-dimensional conversion

7

is a combination of elliptic and hyperbolic motions (and degenerate versions of these motions

such as occurs, for example, when ω = 0). However, we have not yet exhausted all possible

congruence transformations. Now consider congruence transformations that are pure scale

transformations (i.e. diagonal matrices with |det(Q)| ≡ Q 6= 1). From det(D′) = Q2det(D)

we have ηµνB′

µB′

ν = Q2ηµνBµBν. Thus the light-cone is invariant, but the numerical value of

the determinant oﬀ the light-cone can change. Using B′ = ΛB we ﬁnd that Λ now preserves

the Minkowski tensor only to an overall scale factor: ˜ΛηΛ = Q2η, implying Λ is not a

Lorentz transformation, but a conformal one. We still have Ω′ = ΛΩ˜Λ, and therefore ηΩ′ =

Q2 ˜Λ−1ηΩ˜Λ. This implies that the characteristic polynomial of ηΩ′ is P ′(λ) ≡ det(ηΩ′ −λ) =

det(˜Λ−1(Q2ηΩ − λ)˜Λ) = Q8P (λ/Q2). Therefore P ′(λ) = λ4 + (ω2 − γ2)λ2Q4 − (γ · ω)2Q8,

and we arrive, ﬁnally, at the result that the ratio

K ≡

ω2 − γ2
γ · ω

(8)

is the sole quantity that is invariant under all (constant) congruence transformations of the

2 × 2 reduced dispersion matrix. As mentioned earlier, the entries of Ω are Poisson brackets,

hence the entire matrix is invariant under canonical transformations, and we have uncovered

a new quantity that is invariant under both sets of transformations.

In a separate paper we shall discuss how to exploit the connection with the Lorentz

group to construct the normal form of the reduced dispersion matrix. If γ and ω are not

already parallel, it is possible to make them so by performing a ‘boost’ in the direction ω × γ

with an appropriate choice of boost parameter. Hence, there is a set of frames where ω

and γ are parallel. In such a frame, the invariant we have uncovered reduces to a simple

function K = κ − κ−1 with κ ≡ ω′/γ′. The primes indicate that these are measured in these

special frames. This reveals that the invariant κ has a natural interpretation as the helicity

of a ray and measures the rate at which it ‘rotates’ relative to the rate of exponentiation.

The sign of κ (the ‘handedness’ of the ray helix, as deﬁned in the four-dimensional B-

space) is also invariant. We shall also discuss how to solve the related 2 × 2 wave equation

using generalizations of the fourier transform, and how to incorporate these new results into

8

numerical ray tracing codes.

Particle beams guided by electromagnetic vortices: New solutions of the Lorentz,
Schr¨odinger, Klein-Gordon, and Dirac equations

It is shown that electromagnetic vortices can act as beam guides for charged particles. The
conﬁnement in the transverse directions is due to the rotation of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
around the vortex line. Large class of exact solutions describing various types of relativistic beams
formed by an electromagnetic wave with a simple vortex line is found both in the classical and in
the quantum case. In the second case, the motion in the transverse direction is fully quantized.
Particle trajectories trapped by a vortex are very similar to those in a helical undulator.

PACS numbers: 41.75.Ht, 42.50.Vk, 03.65.Pm, 03.65.Ge

Electromagnetic waves with vortices have been ex-
tensively studied both theoretically and experimentally.
This ﬁeld of research has became known as singular op-
tics [1]. In this work I take these studies one step further
and analyze the motion of charged particles in the vicin-
ity of a vortex line. I shall consider the simplest possible
solution of Maxwell equations with a straight vortex line
and show that this conﬁguration of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld acts as a perfect beam guide for charged particles.
I study these nonspreading beams in the classical case,
when the relativistic particle trajectory is determined by
the Lorentz equations, and also in the quantum case,
when the wave function describing the beam obeys the
Schr¨odinger, Klein-Gordon, or the Dirac equation. In the
classical and in the quantum case, I exhibit analytic so-
lutions that enable one to fully understand the intricate
dynamics of these beams.

The electric and magnetic ﬁeld vectors of my model

Maxwell ﬁeld are

E(x, y, z, t) = B0ω (f (x, y, z, t), g(x, y, z, t), 0) ,
B(x, y, z, t) = B0k (

g(x, y, z, t), f (x, y, z, t), 0) , (1b)

where B0 is the ﬁeld amplitude measured in units of the
magnetic ﬁeld and

f (x, y, z, t) = x cos(ωt−) + y sin(ωt−),
y cos(ωt−),
g(x, y, z, t) = x sin(ωt−)

z/c. This conﬁguration of the ﬁeld is the
where t− = t
simplest example of the EM ﬁeld with a vortex line [2, 3].
The solution of the Maxwell equations given by Eqs. (1)
is not as artiﬁcial as it may look at a ﬁrst glance.
It
is a fairly good approximation (near the z-axis and not
far from the waist compared to the Raleigh range) to
a realistic circularly polarized paraxial Laguerre-Gauss
beam with n = 0 and m = 1.

The Lorentz equations of motion

the components (ξ, η, ζ, θ) of the four-vector ξµ(τ ), have

the dependence on the proper time τ )

¨ζ/c = 0 and this leads to the ﬁrst conserved quantity

Owing to Eq. (5), the transverse motion separates from
the longitudinal motion and the equations for ξ and η
may be solved ﬁrst. This task is made easier by trans-
forming Eqs. (4a-4b) to the frame rotating (in proper
time) with the angular velocity Ω/2 around the z-axis
which amounts to replacing ξ and η by the new variables

α(τ ) = ξ(τ ) cos(Ωτ /2) + η(τ ) sin(Ωτ /2),

β(τ ) =

ξ(τ ) sin(Ωτ /2) + η(τ ) cos(Ωτ /2).

the diagonal form of the Hamiltonian (12) indicates that
the beam dynamics in the transverse plane is governed
by the same combination of the attractive/repulsive os-
cillator forces and the Coriolis force as one encounters for
a particle in the Paul trap [4], an electron Trojan wave
packet in an atom (cf. Eq. (7) of Ref. [5]), or Trojan
asteroids in the Sun-Jupiter system [5].

The general solution for ξ(τ ) and η(τ ) is obtained by
solving Eqs. (10) in terms of eigenmodes and then undo-
ing the rotation (9). The ﬁnal expression for the motion
of particles in the plane perpendicular to the vortex line

Depending on the sign of the linear term, the guiding

havior is a purely relativistic eﬀect. In the nonrelativistic
limit, the motion in the z-direction is free, not aﬀected by
the wave at all, ζ(t) = vzt. In Fig. 1, I show two trajecto-
ries of electrons for diﬀerent initial conditions. These tra-
jectories are very similar to those in a helical undulator
(an arrangement of permanent magnets used to produce
circularly polarized radiation). In the present case, the
role of permanent magnets is played by an electromag-
netic wave with a vortex line and the beam conﬁnement
is due to a totally diﬀerent (Trojan) mechanism.

I shall start the analysis of the quantum-mechanical
problem with the Klein-Gordon (KG) equation. The EM
ﬁeld (1) may be derived from the vector potential

A(x, y, z, t) = B0 (g(x, y, z, t), f (x, y, z, t), 0) .

(17)

As seen from the analysis of the classical solutions, it is
preferable to use the coordinates x, y and t±. The KG
equation in these coordinates reads

in this equation, one may seek its solutions in the form

An additional phase factor, dependent on t−, has been
introduced to remove the mass term. The essential de-
pendence on t− is still contained in the wave function ˜ψ.

t−. Therefore, everything that one can say about the

Having diagonalized the Hamiltonian, one may gener-

are obtained by acting on the fundamental state φ0 with

diﬀerential equations ˆa±φ0 = 0, one obtains

The wave functions of the Fock states are polynomials in
x and y multiplied by the Gaussian (26). In the labo-
ratory frame these solutions are not stationary since the
beams do not exhibit rotational symmetry around the z-
= d−). In particular, the fundamental solution
axis (d+ 6
takes on a form of a rotating helix.

There is also a plethora of nonstationary solutions of
Eq. (22). First, there are those that correspond directly

to classical trajectories — the analogs of coherent states.
The fundamental solution (26) corresponds to a trajec-
tory which just sits on the vortex line, but one may easily
obtain solutions of the KG equation representing all other
classical trajectories. According to a general scheme [7]
valid for all quadratic Hamiltonians, displacing any solu-
tion of the KG equation by the solutions of the classical
equations of motion leads to new solutions. Applying
such displacements to the solution (26), one obtains

The ﬁrst equation enables one to express ˜Ψ+ in terms of
˜Ψ− and leads to Eq. (20) for ˜Ψ−. Again, as in the case
of the KG equation, the dependence of the potential on
t− may be eliminated by the substitution (19) and the
equation for Φ− can be reduced to the same Eq. (22) as
for a spinless particle. Still, the spin does play a role in
the Dirac particle dynamics. Since the transformation to
the comoving frame should also involve the spin part, the
proper transformation rule, instead of (21), is now

where τ = t−/
and the center-of-mass trajectories are
obtained by solving the Hamilton’s equations of motion
that follow from (11). The time-dependent phase of the
normalization constant is equal to the classical action [7].
To obtain the solution of the original equation, one must
transform the wave function from the comoving frame
back to the laboratory frame applying the inverse trans-
formation to (21). Only then one obtains the quantum-
mechanical counterparts of the classical trajectories.

Solutions based on a rigid Gaussian — the analogs
of coherent states — do not exhaust all possibilities.
Since the center of mass motion of the Gaussian wave-
packet decouples from its internal motion, one may easily
generate solutions based on oscillating Gaussians — the
analogs of squeezed states. The Gaussian parameters d±
and d for such states are functions of t−. These states do
not have direct classical counterparts and their complete
analysis will be given elsewhere.

The solution of the Dirac equation proceeds along sim-
ilar lines. I begin with rewriting the Dirac equation in

thing that has been said before about stationary solutions
of the KG equation applies with almost trivial changes
to the Dirac equation.

There are two properties of the solutions of the wave
equations described here that might lead to new eﬀects:
the quantization of the transverse motion and the break-
ing of the rotational symmetry. This may help to observe
the rotational frequency shift predicted some time ago [8]
that depends crucially on these features.

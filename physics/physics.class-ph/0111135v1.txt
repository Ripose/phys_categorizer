We present numerical results on the transmission proper-
ties of the left-handed materials (LHM) and split-ring res-
onators (SRR). The simulation results are in qualitative
agreement with experiments. The dependence of the trans-
mission through LHM on the real and imaginary part of the
electric permittivity of the metal, the length of the system,
and the size of the unit cell are presented. We also study the
dependence of the resonance frequency of the array of SRR
on the ring thickness, inner diameter, radial and azimuthal
gap, as well as on the electrical permittivity of the board and
the embedding medium, where SRR resides. Qualitatively
good agreement with previously published analytical results
is obtained.

I. INTRODUCTION

Very recently, a new area of the research, called left-handed
materials (LHM) has been experimentally demonstrated by
Smith et al.1,2 based on the work of Pendry et al.3,4. LHM are
by deﬁnition composites, whose properties are not determined
by the fundamental physical properties of their constituents
but by the shape and distribution of speciﬁc patterns included
in them. Thus, for certain patterns and distribution, the mea-
sured eﬀective permittivity ǫeﬀ and the eﬀective permeability
µeﬀ can be made to be less than zero. In such materials, the
phase and group velocity of an electro-magnetic wave prop-
agate in opposite directions giving rise to a number of novel
properties5. This behavior has been called “left-handedness”,
a term ﬁrst used by Veselago6 over thirty years ago, to de-
scribe the fact that the electric ﬁeld, magnetic intensity and
propagation vector are related by a left-handed rule.

By combining a 2D array of split-ring resonators (SRRs)
with a 2D array of wires, Smith et al.1 demonstrated for the
ﬁrst time the existence of left-handed materials. Pendry et
al.4 has suggested that an array of SRRs give an eﬀective
µeﬀ , which can be negative close to its resonance frequency.
It is also well known3,7 that an array of metallic wires be-
haves like a high-pass ﬁlter, which means that the eﬀective
dielectric constant is negative at low frequencies. Recently,
Shelby et al.8 demonstrated experimentally that the index of
refraction n is negative for a LHM. Negative refraction index
was obtained analytically9 and also from numerically simu-
lated data10. Also, Pendry11 has suggested that a LHM with
negative n can make a perfect lens.

Speciﬁc properties of LHM makes them interesting for
physical and technological applications. While experimental
preparation of the LHM structures is rather diﬃcult, espe-
cially when isotropic structures are required, numerical simu-
lations could predict how the transmission properties depends
It will be
on various structural parameters of the system.

extremely diﬃcult, if not impossible, to predict the transmis-
sion properties of such materials analytically. Mutual electro-
magnetic interaction of neighboring SRRs and wires makes
the problem even more diﬃcult. Numerical simulations of var-
ious conﬁgurations of SRRs and of LHMs could be therefore
very useful in searching of the direction of the technological
development.

In this paper, we present systematic numerical results for
the transmission properties of LHMs and SRRs. An improved
version of the transfer-matrix method (TMM) is used. Trans-
fer matrix was applied to problems of the transmission of the
electro-magnetic (EM) waves through non-homogeneous me-
dia many years ago12–14. It was also used in numerical sim-
ulations of the photonic band gap materials (for references
see Ref. 15). TMM enables us to ﬁnd a transmission and
a reﬂection matrices from which the transmission, reﬂection
and absorption could be obtained. The original numerical al-
gorithm was described in Ref. 13. In our program we use a
diﬀerent algorithm which was originally developed for the cal-
culation of the electronic conductance of disordered solids16.
The paper is organized as follows: In Section II we describe
brieﬂy the structure. We concentrate on the structure dis-
played in Figure 1. In Section III we present and discuss our
results. The dependence of the transmission of the LHM and
SRR on the electrical permittivity of the metallic components
of our structure is given in Section III A. In Section III B we
present the dependence of the transmission of the LHM on
the size of the unit cell and size of the metallic wires. In Sec-
tion III C we show the dependence of the resonance frequency
of SRR on the parameters of the SRR. Section III D deals
with the dependence of the resonance frequency on the per-
mittivity of the board and embedding media. In Section IV
we summarize our results and give some conclusions. Finally,
in the Appendix A we give detailed description of the transfer
matrix method.

II. STRUCTURE OF THE LHM
META-MATERIAL

Both in the experiment and in the numerical simulations,
the left-handed meta-materials consist from an array of unit
cells, each containing one SRR and one wire. Figure 1a shows
a realization of the unit cell that we have simulated. The size
of the unit cell Lx × Ly × Lz and the size of SRR itself are
of order of mm. Waves propagate along the z-direction. The
SRR lies in the yz plane, and the wire is parallel to the y axis.
As we are interested mostly in the transmission properties
of the left-handed meta-material, the conﬁguration as pre-
sented in Figure 1a, should be considered as one-dimensional.
Indeed, such meta-materials possesses the left-handed prop-
erties only for the electro-magnetic wave incoming in the z-
direction and even then only for a given polarization. Two-

1

dimensional structures have been realized in experiments2,8,
in which two SRRs have been positioned in each unit cell in
two perpendicular planes. For such structures, left-handed
transmission properties have been observed for waves coming
from any direction in the xz plane. No three - dimensional
structure has been realized so far.

Figure 1b shows a single square SRR of the type used for
our simulations and also for experiments2. The structure of
the SRR is deﬁned by the following parameters:
the ring
thickness c, the radial gap d, the azimuthal gap g and the
inner diameter r. The size of the SRR is

w = 4c + 2d + r.

(1)

Another parameter is the thickness of the SRR itself (in
the x-direction). This thickness is very small in the experi-
ments (∼ 0.02 mm). We can not simulate such thin struc-
tures yet. In numerical simulations, we divide the unit cell
into Nx × Ny × Nz mesh points. For homogeneous discretiza-
tion, used throughout this paper, the discretization deﬁnes
the minimum unit length δ = Lx/Nx. All length parameters
are then given as integer of δ. This holds also for the thick-
ness of the SRR. Generally, the thickness of SRR used in our
simulations is 0.25-0.33 mm. Although we do not expect that
the thickness will considerably inﬂuence the electro-magnetic
properties of the SRR, it still could cause small quantitative
diﬀerence between our data and the experimental results.

III. STRUCTURAL PARAMETERS

A. Metallic permittivity

The

existence

of
LHM has been experimentally demonstrated1,2 for structures
that have resonance frequencies in the GHz region.
In this
frequency region, we do not know the exact values of electri-
cal permittivity ǫm of the metal. We know that Im ǫm is very
large, and/or the Re ǫm is large but negative. In our previous
studies17 we have found that the resonance frequency ν0 of
the LHM depends only on the absolute value of ǫm. In fact ν0
reaches the saturated value provided that |ǫm| > 104. Since
we do not know the exact values of the metallic permittivity,
we have studied the transmission of the LHM with diﬀerent
values of ǫm. In the results presented in Figure 2, we choose
ǫm = 1 + i Im ǫm with diﬀerent values of Im ǫm.18 The last
is proportional to σ(ω)/ω19. For simplicity, we neglect the
ω-dependence of Im ǫm and consider Im ǫm = 8000, 18000
and 38000 for the three cases presented in Figure 2. For each
case, we present results of transmission for diﬀerent number
(1 to 10) of unit cells. Notice that the higher imaginary part
of the metal the higher is the transmission. Also the losses
due to the absorption are smaller, as can be seen from the
decrease of the transmission peak as the length of the system
increases. This result is consistent with the formula presented
by Pendry et al.4 for the eﬀective permeability of the system

where ρ is the resistance of the metal, Lx is the size of the
system along the x axis, clight is a the velocity of light in vac-
uum and parameters r, c and d characterize the structure of
SRR. They are deﬁned in Figure 1b. Notice that the damping
term γ → 0 as σ → ∞. Since the Im ǫm is proportional to σ,
γ is inversely proportional to Im ǫm. Our numerical results
suggest that it is reasonable to expect that the LHM eﬀect
will be more pronounced in systems with higher conductivity.
In Figure 3, we present the frequency dependence of the
transmission for SRRs with the same parameters as those in
Figure 2. Notice that the transmission is more pronounced
as the length of the system is increased. Note also that the
resonance gap becomes narrower when Im ǫm increases. This
is in agreement with Eq. (2). The frequency interval, in which
the eﬀective permeability is negative, becomes narrower when
the damping factor γ decreases.

In Figure 4 we show the transmission through the LHM, in
which the SRR are turned around their axis by 90 degrees. If
we keep the same size of the unit cell as that of Figure 2, we
do not obtain any LHM peak in the transmission, although
there is a very well deﬁned gap for the SRR alone. It seems
that for this orientation of the SRR there is no overlap of the
ﬁeld of the wire with that of the SRR. The results shown in
Figures 4 and 5 are therefore obtained with a reduced unit
cell of 3.66 × 3.66 × 3.66 mm (the size of SRR is still 3 × 3
mm). The LHM transmission peak is located close to the
lower edge of the SRR gap (shown in Figure 5). This is in
contrast to the results presented in Figures 2 and 3, where the
LHM transmission peak is always located close to the upper
edge of the SRR gap. Finally, the gap shown for the “turned”
SRR shown in the Figure 5, is deeper and broader than the
gap for the “up” SRR.

−7 − 10

In fact, for the SRR “up” structure, we found that the
−8. We
transmission in the gap is always of order of 10
can explain this eﬀect by non-zero transmission from the p to
s polarized wave (and back). If the transmission t(p → s) and
t(s → p) > 0, then there is always the non-zero probability
∝ t(p → s)t(s → p) for the p-polarized wave to switch into
the s state, at the beginning of the sample, move throughout
the sample as the s wave (for which neither wires nor SRR are
interesting), and in the last unit cell to switch back into the p-
polarized state. This process contributes to the transmission
probability T (p → p) of the whole sample and determines
the bottom level of the transmission gap for SRR. We indeed
found that t(s → p) ∼ 10−4 for the “up” SRR. In the “turned”
SRR case, both t(p → s) and t(s → p) should be zero due to
the symmetry of the unit cell.20 Our data give t(p → s) ∼
−6 for the “turned” SRR which determines the
t(s → p) ∼ 10
decrease of the transmission in the gap below 10

−11.

B. Dependence on the size of the unit cell and the
width of the metallic wire.

As we discussed in Section III A, the transmission peak
for the LHM with cuts in the SRR in the horizontal direction
appears only when the size of the unit cell is really small. The
eﬀect of the size of the unit cell was demonstrated already in
Figures 2 and 3, where we compared the transmission for the
“up” SRR and LHM of diﬀerent size of the unit cell. Both the
transmission gap for an array of SRRs and the transmission
peak for LHM are broader for smaller unit cell.

In Figure 6, we show the transmission for the LHM struc-
ture with q unit cell of size 5 × 3.66 × 5 mm for the “turned”
SRR. Evidently, there is no transmission peak for all the sys-
tem lengths studied. The size of the unit cell must be reduced
considerably to obtain a transmission peak.

Figure 7 presents the transmission peak for various sizes of
the unit cell. Resonance frequency decreases as the distance
between the SRRs in the x direction decreases. This agree
qualitatively (although not quantitatively) with theoretical
formula given by Eqn. (4). We see also that an increase of
the distance between SRR in the z direction while keeping
the Lx constant causes sharp decrease and narrowness of the
transmission peak.

C. Resonance frequency of SRR

In this section we study how the structure of the SRR inﬂu-
ences the position of the resonance gap. In order to simulate
various forms of the SRR, we need to have as many as possible
mesh points in the yz plane. Keeping in mind the increase
of the computer time when the number of mesh points in-
creases, we used a unit cell with Lx < Ly, Lz. The actual
size of the unit cell in this section is Lx = 2.63 mm and
Ly = Lz = 6.05 mm. and we use uniform discretization with
Nx × Ny × Nz = 10 × 23 × 23 mesh points. This discretization
deﬁnes a minimum unit length δ = 0.263 mm. SRR with size
of ≈ 5 × 5 mm, is divided into 19 × 19 mesh points.

The electrical permittivity of the metallic components is
chosen to be ǫm = −1000 + 10.000 i. We expect that larger
value of Im ǫm will increase a little the position of the reso-
nance gap17. However, the dependence on the diﬀerent struc-
tural parameters will remain the same. Higher values of |ǫm|,
however, will require more CPU time because of shorter inter-
val between the normalization of the transmitted waves (see
Appendix A for details).

We have considered 23 diﬀerent SRR structures and stud-
ied how the resonance frequency ν0 depends on the structure
parameters. The lowest ν0 = 3.75 GHz was found for SRR
with c : d : r : g = 1 : 1 : 13 : 1. On the other hand, SRR
with c : d : r : g = 2 : 3 : 5 : 3 exhibits ν0 = 6.86 GHz.

We present our results on the dependence of ν0 on the az-
imuthal gap c (Figure 8), radial gap g (Figure 9) and ring
thickness d (Figure 10). In all these cases ν0 increases as the
diﬀerent parameters increase. The dependence shown in Fig-
ures 8-10 agrees qualitatively with those done by a diﬀerent
numerical method21. When compare our results with the an-
alytical arguments presented by Pendry et al.4, we have to

keep in mind that that various assumptions about the struc-
tural parameters have been done in derivation of Eqn. (4),
which are not fulﬁlled for our structure. Note also that the
azimuthal gap does not enter the formula for the resonance
frequency given by Eq.
(4). Moreover, as the size of the
SRR is constant, the structural parameters are not indepen-
dent each form other. Thus, due to the Eq. (1), increase of
the azimuthal gap causes decrease of the inner diameter and
vice versa. When taking these restrictions into account, the
agreement with analytical results is satisfactory.

D. Material parameters

In Figures 11 and 12 we show how the resonance frequency
depends on the permittivity of the dielectric board and on
the permittivity of the embedding media. As expected, the
resonance frequency decreases considerably with the increase
of the value of both permittivities.

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, we have used the transfer matrix method to
calculate the transmission properties of the left-handed ma-
terials and arrays of split ring resonators. The role of absorp-
tion of the metallic components of our SRR and LHM has
been simulated. It is found that the LHM transmission peak
depends on the imaginary part of the metallic permittivity
ǫm, the length of the system and the size of the unit cell.
Higher conductivity of the metal guarantees better transmis-
sion properties of LHM.

For an array of SRR, the resonance frequency ν0 was com-
puted and is found to agree with experimental data. The
dependence of the resonance frequency ν0 on various struc-
tural parameters of the SRR were numerically obtained and
compared with analytical estimates and also with other nu-
merical techniques.

The main disadvantage of the presented transfer-matrix
method is that it can not treat structures with smaller length
scales than our discretization mesh. For example, the thick-
ness of the SRR is an order of magnitude smaller in experi-
ments than in our simulation. Also structural parameters of
SRR can be changed only discontinuously as multiplies of the
unit mesh length. This could be partially overcomed by gener-
alizing the present code to a non-uniform mesh discretization.
Nevertheless, already uniform discretization enables us to ob-
tain credible data. Comparison of our results with those ob-
tained by the commercial software MAFIA22 conﬁrmed that
both methods ﬁnd the same position of the resonant gap pro-
vided that they use the same mesh discretization.

Our numerical data agree qualitatively with the experimen-
tal results.1 As we can not tune the exact parameters of SRR
(as well as its circular shape), and when taken into account the
strong dependence of the resonance frequency on the permit-
tivity of the board, we do not expect to obtain very accurate
quantitative agreement with experimental data.

Our studies demonstrate that the transfer matrix method
can be reliable used to calculate the transmission and reﬂec-

3

tion properties of left-handed materials and split-ring res-
onators. Thus, numerical simulations could answer some
practical questions about diﬀerent proposed structures, which
might be too complicated to be treated by analytical studies.
The transfer matrix method can be used in the future for de-
tailed studies of two-dimensional and even three-dimensional
structures. These structures should contain more SRRs and
wires per unit cell, which makes their analytical analysis ex-
tremely diﬃcult. On the other hand, it is extremely important
to ﬁnd the best design and test the transmission properties
of proposed meta-material even before their fabrication and
experimental measurements start.

We assume that our system is connected to two semi-
inﬁnite leads (with ǫ = 1 and µ = 1). EM wave is coming from
the right and is scattered by the sample. Resulting waves ei-
ther continues to the left on the left side lead, or are traveling
back to the right on the right side lead. Periodic boundary
conditions in the directions perpendicular to the direction of
the wave propagation are used.

We decompose the system into n thin slices and deﬁne a
TM for each of them. Explicit form of the TM for a thin slice
is in Refs. 12 and 13. The EM ﬁeld in the (k + 1)th slice can
be obtain from the kth slice as

Φk+1 = TkΦk.

with Tk being the transfer matrix corresponding to the kth
slice. The transfer matrix T of the whole sample reads

Transfer matrix calculations are based on the scattering
formalism. The sample is considered as the scatterer of an
incoming wave. The wave normalized to the unit current is
coming from the −∞, and is scattered by the sample. Scat-
terer is characterized by four parameters: transmission of the
wave from the left to the right (t+), from the right to the
left (t−), and by reﬂection coeﬃcient from the right to the
right (r+) and from the left to the left (r−). Corresponding
scattering matrix S reads:

Transfer matrix (TM) fulﬁlls the composition law. If the
sample consists from two subsystems, then the transfer ma-
trix T12 of the whole sample can be calculated form transfer
matrices of its subsystems as

T = TnTn−1 . . . T2T1

(A7)

If there is N mesh points in the slice, then the length of
the vector Φ is 4N (it contains 4 components of EM ﬁeld in
each point).

Note that we are able to ﬁnd the explicit form of the TM
only in the real space representation. To obtain the transmis-
sion, we have to transform the TM into the “wave” represen-
tation, which is deﬁned by the eigenvectors of the TM in the
leads. Therefore, in the ﬁrst step we have to diagonalize the
TM in the leads.

Each eigenvalue of the TM is two time degenerate because
there are two polarizations p and s of the EM wave. More-
−1 is also an eigenvalue
over, if λ is an eigenvalue, then λ
corresponding to the wave traveling in the opposite direc-
tion. In general, the TM has some eigenvalues with modulus
equal to 1: λ = exp ik. The corresponding eigenvectors rep-
resent propagating waves. Others eigenvalues are of the form
λ = exp ±κ. They correspond to the evanescent modes. For
the frequency range which is interesting for the LHM studies,
the TM has only one propagating mode.

As the TM is not Hermitian matrix, we have to calculate
left and right eigenvectors separately. From the eigenvectors
we construct three matrices: The 2N ×4N matrix R1 contains
in its columns 2N right eigenvectors which correspond to the
wave traveling to the left. Matrices L1 and L2 are 4N × 2N
matrices which contains in their rows the left eigenvectors
corresponding to waves traveling to the left and to the right,
respectively.

ables us to ﬁnd the transmission matrix explicitly16

and the reﬂection matrix from the relation

Resulting TM T12 has again the form (A4). This composi-
tion law enables us to calculate transmission of complicated
structure from the transfer matrices of its parts (thin slices).
In numerical calculations, the total volume of the system
is divided into small cells and ﬁelds in each cell are coupled
to those in the neighboring cell. We discretize the Maxwell
equations following the method described in Ref. 13. In each
point of the lattice we have to calculate four components of
the EM ﬁeld: Ex, Ey, Hx, Hy.

At this point we have to distinguish between the propagating
and the evanescent modes. For a frequency range of interest,
the TM in leads has only one propagating mode for each di-
rection. We need therefore only 2 × 2 sub-matrices t−(ij) and
r+(ij) with i, j = 1 or 2 for the p or s polarized wave. The
transmission and reﬂection are then

The matrix inversion in the formulae (A15-A18) can ob-

deed, matrix BA
tem of linear equations B = XA. CPU time could be reduces
considerably in this way, especially for large matrices.

All elements of the matrices on the rhs of Eqn. (A17) are
of order of unity. The price we have to pay for this stability is
an increase of the CPU time. Fortunately, if the elements of
the transfer matrix are not too large (which is not the case in

5

systems studied in this paper), then it is enough to perform
described normalization procedure only after every 6-8 steps.

18 We analyzed also LHM structures in with Real ǫm large
and negative simultaneously with Im ǫm large and positive
(data not presented here). We found that the value of Re
ǫm inﬂuences neither the position of the resonance gap nor
the absorption provided that Im ǫm is large enough.

20 In our systems, the symmetry with respect to transforma-
tion x → −x is broken by presence of the dielectric board
with permittivity ǫ = 3.4. This is a reason for non-zero (al-
though very small) values of the transmission t(p → s) and
t(s → p) in the “turned” SRR array.

FIG. 3. Transmission for SRR for the same systems as in
Figure 2. Data conﬁrm that the resonance frequency does
not depend on the metallic permittivity. This agrees with17.
However, resonance gap becomes narrower as Im ǫm of the
metallic components increases. Shaded area represents a gap
for the array of the SRR with a unit cell 3.66 × 3.66 × 3.66

FIG. 9. Resonance frequency as a function of the radial

The size of the sample and of the unit cell is an in Fig-
ure 8.
In contrast to Eqn. (4), which predicts decrease of
ν0 when c increases, we found increase of the resonance fre-
quency. This could be explained by the fact that an increase
of the radial gap causes decrease of the inner diameter because
r + 2c = 3.947 mm (◦) and 2.895 mm (△). Presented data
can be therefore interpreted also as the inner diameter - de-
−3/2) is
pendence of the resonance frequency. The last (ν0 ∼ r

much stronger than the logarithmic dependence ν0 ∼ ln
Then, presented data conﬁrm that the decrease of the inner
diameter causes an increase of the resonance frequency.

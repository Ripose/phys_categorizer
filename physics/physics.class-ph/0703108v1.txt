From E = mc2 to the Lorentz transformations via the law of addition of relativistic velocities.2

1. Introduction

This year is the centenary of the 1905 Einstein Agnus Mirabilis [1]. In that year he
published ﬁve important papers for the future of the physics. One of them [1] was about
the photoelectric eﬀect, and for it Einstein won the 1921 Nobel prize in physics; two of
them [1] were about statistic mechanics, and the others two on what was later known
as the special theory of relativity. The ﬁrst of those papers [2], On the electrodynamic
of Moving Bodies, was published on June 30, and contains the basic theory of special
relativity. In that paper he proved the relativistic formula of addition of velocities. This
formula shows ”that the velocity of the light c cannot be altered by addition with a velocity
less than the light” (see [2], p.51), and therefore he solved the problem motivated by the
fact ”that light is always propagated in empty space with a deﬁnite velocity c which is
independent of the state of motion of the emitting body” (see [2], p.38). Three months
later he published: ”Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy-content?” [3]. In
that paper he concluded that ”the mass of a body is a measure of its energy content”.
This led to the famous formula E = mc2. In this paper we reverse in some sense the
logic of the expository order of those papers. Our basic physical assumptions are:

(i) The mass-energy equivalence relation, (ii) the energy conservation law, (iii)
the momentum conservation law, (iv) the special relativity principle. From these
assumptions we show how can be deduced the relativistic formula of addition of
velocities, and then the Lorentz Transformations(LT).

2. Addition of parallel and perpendicular velocities

To simplify our exposition we choose the standard coordinates (x, y, z, t) and (x′, y′, z′, t′)
in two arbitrary inertial frames(IF) S and S′, in the standard conﬁguration, that is, the
S′ origin moves with velocity v along the x-axis of S, the x′-axis coincides with the
x-axis, while the y- and y′-axes remain parallel, as do the z- and z′-axes; and all clocks
are set to zero when the two origins meet (see
[4], p. 43). We have assumed the
Special Relativity Principle(SRP), and it is well known that from the SRP follows the
homogeneity and isotropy of all the IF, but as it is noted in Ref. [4], p. 40, it is perhaps
less well known that, conversely, the homogeneity and isotropy of all the IF imply the
SRP. Now y′ = y and z′ = z follow by assuming that the transformation between IF is
linear and the SRP holds. In fact, linearity follows from Newton’s ﬁrst law and temporal
and spatial homogeneity (see Ref. [4], p. 43).

Our starting point will be the equivalence between mass and energy, that is,
E = mc2, where E is the energy content of one particle, c is the vacuum velocity
of the light, and m is the inertial mass of the particle, which is given by m0γu, where
u2/c2)1/2 in an IF of reference in which the particle moves with velocity u
γu = (1

(u =
), and m0 is the rest mass of the particle. The relativistic momentum is given

by p = mu. Consider a massless box, which contains two particles, 1 and 2, with equal
rest mass m0, moving along a straight line with speeds -u and u respectively, in the IF

Figure 1. The rest mass M0 of the box-particle B is the sum of the energy of the two
particles 1 and 2. To ﬁnd the addition of the parallel velocities u and v, we calculate
the total energy and the total momentum in S′ by two ways: as one unique particle B
and as two separated particles 1 and 2.

S in which the box is at rest, so S is the zero-momentum frame( [4], p.117).

We will calculate now the total energy and the total momentum of the system of
the two particles in the frame S′ by two diﬀerent ways: one by considering the system
as a unique box-particle B, whose rest mass M0 is a measure of the energy content of
the box, and the other by considering the system as two separated particles.

In the ﬁrst case the total energy of B in the frame S′ is given by E = M0γvc2, and
by use of the Einstein’s assumption that M0 is a measure of the energy content of the
box B, M0 = 2m0γu, so E = 2m0γuγvc2. In the same way the momentum of B in S′ is
given by p = M0γvv = 2m0γuγvv.

In the second case E = m0γv1c2 + m0γv2c2, and p = m0γv1v1 + m0γv2v2, where v1
and v2 are respectively the velocities of the particles 1 and 2 in the frame S′. Comparing
the energy E and the momentum p calculated by the two ways we obtain:

2γuγv = γv1 + γv2,

2γuγvv = γv1v1 + γv2v2

(2.1)

We will ﬁnd now the formula of addition of the velocities u and v for the cases in
which they are parallel or perpendicular. In the following it is assumed that coordinate
transformations between IF include all rigid motions in the 3-space,
in particular
rotations and space-reﬂections which are the transformations used in this paper.

2.1. Addition of parallel velocities

Consider that the particles 1 and 2 of the massless box move along the x-axis (see Fig. 1).
This conﬁguration is invariant under rotations about x-axis in S, and then from the SRP
this conﬁguration must be invariant under rotations about x′-axis in S′ too. That follows
from the fact that the rotations about x-axis commute with the transformation between
the IF S and S′, because in the standard conﬁguration the x′-axis coincides with the
x-axis. From that it follows that v1 and v2 have both the direction of the x′-axis and so

Figure 2. We use this disposition of the particles 1 and 2, to ﬁnd the addition of the
perpendicular velocities u and v.

. Moreover, if we take c = 1 and use as new variables
we can denote them by v1 and v2
the rapidities χ1, χ2, αu, and αv deﬁned by tanh χ1 = v1, tanh χ2 = v2, tanh αu = u,
and tanh αv = v, the Eqs. (2.1) become:

Dividing member by member Eq. 2.3 by Eq. 2.2, we get v = tanh χ1+χ2

χ1+χ2

2 = αv.

Comparing with Eq. 2.2 we get cosh χ1−χ2

= cosh αu, and then χ1−χ2

Therefore, χ1 = αv + αu and χ2 = αv −

αu.

Finally we obtain the following expression for the velocity of particle 1:
tanh αv + tanh αu

These last equations are precisely the formulas of addition of velocities when u and

2.2. Addition of perpendicular velocities

We shall now study the case of u being perpendicular to v. In this case we consider
that the particles 1 and 2 of the massless box move along the y-axis (see Fig. 2). In
this conﬁguration both particles have coordinate z = 0 for any time t in S. Then z′ = 0
(because z′ = z) for both particles and for any time t′ in S′. This implies that v1 and
v2 must be in the plane x′y′. Since the conﬁguration is invariant under the reﬂection

Other way to see that both v1 and v2 are along the x′-axis is to observe that in S y = z = 0 for any
§
time t for both particles, and then, because y′ = y and z′ = z, y′ = z′ = 0 for any time t′ for both
particles in S′, and then v1 and v2 must be along the x′-axis.

and S′, then the conﬁguration in S′ must be invariant under the reﬂection y′
y′.
This implies that v1 and v2 must be in the plane x′y′. On the other hand, the invariance
y′ implies that v1 = v2 and the angle between v1 and the x′-axis, θ, is
under y′
the opposite to the angle between v2 and the x′-axis. Then v1 = v1(cos θ,
sin θ),
v2 = v1(cos θ, sin θ). Now from Eqs. (2.1) we get:

3. Transformation of the velocities

We will now get the general formulas for the transformation of the components of the
velocities in a change of reference frame. To this end, consider the collision of two
particles 1 and 2, with the same rest mass m0, and with orthogonal velocities u1 and
u2. Let m3 be the rest mass of the particle 3 resulting from the collision, and w its
2 and w′ the corresponding
velocity in an IF S (see Fig. 3). We also denote by u′
velocities in the frame S′ that moves with velocity v along the direction of u1. Using
the conservation of the energy and the momentum we get:

1, u′

E = m0γu1c2+m0γu2c2 = m3γwc2, E′ = m0γu′
p = m0γu1u1+m0γu2u2 = m3γww, p′ = m0γu′

Observe that, equivalently, the above calculation can be done considering the movement

4. The Lorentz Transformations

The Lorentz Transformations can be obtained from the transformation of velocities if
we assume the SRP. To see this, choose as above the standard coordinates (x, y, z, t)
and (x′, y′, z′, t′) in two arbitrary IF S and S′, in the standard conﬁguration. Consider a
particle moving with uniform velocity from the spacial origin for time zero to the point
(x, y, 0) for time t in the frame S, so its velocity in S is given by: w = (w1, w2, 0) =
(x/t, y/t, 0). Let (x′, y′, z′, t′) the the associated coordinates to (x, y, 0, t) in S′. As it
has been noted in the ﬁrst paragraph of Section 2, from the SRP, it follows that y′ = y
and z′ = z. The velocity in S′ is given by w′ = (w′
2, 0) = (x′/t′, y′/t′, 0). If we now
use the formulas (3.3) and (3.4) of transformation of velocities we get:

y′/t′ =

Now, since y′ = y and z′ = z = 0, we get:

The homogeneity and isotropy of all the IF implies that these transformations are valid
for the coordinates (x, y, z, t) associated to any event in S. Thus we have found the
standard Lorentz transformation equations.

5. Conclusions

We have proved that the law of addition of velocities can be obtained from E = mc2,
the conservation of energy and momentum, and the SRP. Moreover, the Lorentz
transformations are obtained immediately from the law of addition of velocities and
the SRP.

Thus, taking E = mc2 and the conservation of energy and momentum, together
with the SRP as the starting principles of special relativity, is a possible option.
In
fact, the relation between energy and inertial mass was pointed out in some particular
. Moreover, E = mc2 can be
cases 24 years before Einstein’s fundamental paper
considered as an extension of the First Principle of the Thermodynamic, and as such,
a good Principle for the foundation of any theory. However we have to accept that
although the derivation of the LT in this paper is logically interesting, it presupposes
ad hoc the strongly counterintuitive assumptions of the mass-energy and mass-velocity
relations. Therefore, it makes little sense as a means to conceive the LT (in other words,
the premises from which the LT follows are conceptually equally complicated with their
consequence, namely the LT). Consequently, it is didactically of limited interest.

We also note that if we take the terms in u2 and v2 in the power-series expansion
of the total energy, E = 2m0γuγvc2, of the compound particle B, we get the Newtonian
total energy of B. Then, the same reasoning of this paper leads, as it is expected, to the
Galileo transformations via the Galileo addition of velocities

SINGULAR MODES OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD∗

NEIL V. BUDKO† AND ALEXANDER B. SAMOKHIN‡

Abstract. We show that the mode corresponding to the point of essential spectrum of the
electromagnetic scattering operator is a vector-valued distribution representing the square root of
the three-dimensional Dirac’s delta function. An explicit expression for this singular mode in terms
of the Weyl sequence is provided and analyzed. An essential resonance thus leads to a perfect
localization (conﬁnement) of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, which in practice, however, may result in
complete absorption.

1. Introduction. The ability to manipulate the spatial distribution of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld is required in many practical applications. For example, one may
wish to create an antenna with a very broad or a very narrow radiation pattern,
localize and amplify light or transmit it along a predeﬁned optical path, accelerate
In the presence of
charged particles or keep them tight within a fusion chamber.
matter all possible spatial distributions are encoded in the spatial spectrum of the
electromagnetic scattering operator. The most basic ﬁeld distributions, which are
easy to observe in microwave resonators, are called eigenmodes. Manipulation thus
amounts to a clever excitation of a particular eigenmode or a combination of those. If
almost all electromagnetic energy is carried by one of the modes, then we talk about
a resonance. The concept of electromagnetic resonances and eigenmodes is a natural
description of microwave resonators and waveguides [1], microstrip lines [2], and other
simple, often, inﬁnite, homogeneous, or periodic structures [3], [4], [5]. In a recent
paper [6] we have generalized this idea for arbitrary dielectric objects of ﬁnite extent.
The strongest point of our generalization was the incorporation of the full information
about the spatial spectrum of the electromagnetic scattering operator [7], which has
both discrete eigenvalues and an essential (continuous) part.

In some applications, e.g. optoelectronics, plasmonics, photonics, near-ﬁeld op-
tics, the electromagnetic ﬁeld has to be conﬁned within a very small volume of space,
see e.g.
[8], [9], [10] . An observation made in [6] suggests that the modes associ-
ated with the essential spectrum of the scattering operator may be highly localized
in space. In particular, we argued that the resonance, which corresponds to the es-
sential spectrum, coincides with the so-called plasmon observed at a plasma-dielectric
interface. In research on metamaterials, where one strives for a negative permittivity
material with vanishing losses, an unusual “anomalous localized resonance” is also
encountered [11], [12]. Here we give a rigorous proof of the link between the local-
ization or conﬁnement of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and the essential spectrum of the
electromagnetic scattering operator.

N. V. BUDKO AND A. B. SAMOKHIN

Our previous work [6], [7] was based on the Mikhlin’s theory of singular integral
operators [13], and does not concern with the shape of the modes. In fact, there are
very few examples of the analysis of the modes corresponding to the essential spectrum
of operators. In quantum mechanics, where the spectral theory is very advanced, the
discrete spectrum seems to be of more importance. There the essential spectrum
is associated with the unbounded motion of particles [14] and is, therefore, of little
interest to physicists. In electromagnetics, however, it is the practical question of light
conﬁnement which is related to the essential spectrum, and the precise mathematical
description of the associated modes is rather important.

To recover the structure of the modes corresponding to the electromagnetic es-
sential spectrum we resort here to the Weyl’s deﬁnition of spectrum, see e.g.
[14],
[15]. This deﬁnition states that a number λ is in the spectrum of operator A if and
only if there exists a sequence

and

Furthermore, λ is in the essential spectrum, if there is a singular sequence satisfying

complete Hilbert space, then, obviously, such singular sequence will not (strongly)
converge to any function from X, although, it may weakly converge to zero. As
we know, sequences that do (strongly) converge to some function on X generate
eigenfunctions or eigenmodes corresponding to the point spectrum – eigenvalues. By
analogy we may associate essential modes with the essential spectrum. An alternative
term, which, perhaps, better reﬂects the nature and structure of the particular modes
obtained here, would be singular modes.

2. The square root of the delta function. Before going into the details of
the electromagnetic case we shall introduce a peculiar function that is later used to
generate the essential modes. On one hand, the sequence of such functions should be
singular, as required by the deﬁnition mentioned above. On the other hand, appli-
cation of (1.2) to electromagnetics (in L2-norm) and consistency with the previously
obtained results [7] require that the square of this function should behave like the
Dirac delta function, i.e., must have the sifting property. Hence, what we need is a
square root of the delta function.

From time to time the square roots of delta functions appear in literature. Mostly,
though, just as a curious example of a non-convergent sequence, see e.g. [16] (p. 299)
and [17] (p. 81). A more modern and rigorous approach to such functions is the
Colombeau algebra [18], where one studies the products of distributions and encoun-
ters m-singular delta functions, which are almost identical to what we are after. At
present, the main applications of the Colombeau algebra are: nonlinear equations
(e.g. hydrodynamics, elastodynamics and general relativity), singular shock waves in
nonlinear conservation laws, and propagation of delta-like waves in linear media with
discontinuous parameters. In other words, this algebra is applied whenever a poten-
tially meaningless product of generalized functions is stumbled upon. The present
apparent emergence of the Colombeau algebra in the recovery of the essential spec-
trum seems to be new and can, probably, be generalized. This paper, however, does
not attempt such a generalization, nor should it be considered an introduction to the
Colombeau algebra.

Unfortunately, we could not ﬁnd any explicit derivation of the required distribu-
tion in the literature. The available one-dimensional and scalar three-dimensional [14]
(pp. 74–75) examples are of no use to us, since the electromagnetic essential spectrum
is a purely three-dimensional phenomenon and our function and its Fourier transform
had to have a very special vectorial structure. In view of the potential usefulness of
the obtained result in other areas of research, we have decided to devote this entire
section to the analysis of the square root of the three-dimensional delta function. The
proof of the following theorem is, however, rather technical and can be skipped in the
ﬁrst reading.

If we now ﬁx n > N and let m > N go to inﬁnity, then the last term tends to zero
leaving us with a constant (two), which, obviously, cannot be made smaller than an
arbitrary ǫ > 0. This proves that there are no convergent subsequences.

With εr(x, ω) H¨older-continuous in R3 all integral operators in the last term are
weakly singular. Hence, from the Property 6 of Theorem 2.1 the last term in (3.7) is
zero.

From the second term in (3.7) we only consider the expression in the large square

brackets, which we extend to R3. Denoting by

Finally, applying Property 4 (sifting) of Theorem 2.1 we see that the ﬁrst term

in (3.7) is zero, if equality (3.5) holds.

4. Conclusions. Now we know that the electromagnetic essential (singular)
mode is, in fact, the square root of the delta function. But what does it mean from
the physical point of view? Is it possible to have an “essential” resonance? Under
which conditions? Can the electromagnetic ﬁeld be conﬁned to what seems to be a
single point in space? These are open questions. However, one important conclusion
can be deduced from the basic principles of the electromagnetic theory.

The resonant excitation of a singular mode is only possible if the essential spec-
trum contains zero. Physically this means that εr(xc, ω) = 0 at some point xc in

SINGULAR MODES OF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD

the scattering domain D. It may seem improbable, but one has to remember that
the dielectric permittivity is an eﬀective macroscopic parameter, which has very little
meaning for the microscopic induced current densities at the atomic level. Moreover,
in the classical Lorentz theory of atoms, the real part of the dielectric permittivity
in a dispersive medium can vanish and even become negative (the so-called Lorentz
absorption line). Although, in that case the Kramers-Kronig relations predict an in-
crease in the imaginary part of macroscopic εr, which corresponds to the absorption
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Turning it all around we can say that even if at a micro-
scopic level we could have εr(xc, ω) = 0 and excite the corresponding singular mode,
it should be absorbed to preserve the macroscopic Kramers-Kronig relations.

In principle, the very fact that singular modes are outside the Hilbert space, where
all ‘proper’ solutions of the Maxwell equations live, tells us that the excitation of sin-
gular modes can be considered as some kind of ‘deﬂation’ of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Recall that, due to the normalization Property 1 of Theorem 2.1, the electromagnetic
energy associated with a singular mode is well deﬁned.

εr(x, ω)

It is also interesting to note the direct relation of the electromagnetic essential
spectrum and its singular modes to the pseudospectrum and wave-packet pseudo-
modes [19]. There is an obvious similarity of the Weyl’s deﬁnition (1.2) and the
deﬁnition of the pseudospectrum, where instead of zero one should simply put a small
ǫ in the right-hand side of (1.2). Subsequently, we arrive at two distinct possibili-
ties. The ﬁrst is where n
. Then, points λps satisfying
ǫ will belong to the pseudospectrum, while the corresponding modes
λps −
|
will be singular. The second case is where λps = λess = εr(x, ω) or very close to it,
In this case, we stop the sequence of Ψ(α, xc, x), at some ﬁnite α,
but α
for which the norm in (3.6) equals ǫ. Although, it is diﬃcult to derive an explicit
relation for δ(ǫ), we can anticipate that Ψ(δ(ǫ), xc, x) will be highly localized in space
around the point xc. In this case the mode is not singular and belongs to the Hilbert
space. These two physically distinct possibilities emphasize the nonunique nature of
the pseudospectrum as it is deﬁned in [19] and elsewhere.

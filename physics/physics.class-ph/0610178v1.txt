This short article contains the derivation of a general formula for the magnetostatic ﬁeld in the

neighbourhood of an axis of symmetry.

I.

INTRODUCTION

There is a remarkable result in magnetostatic when the ﬁeld posses cylindrical symmetry, namely, for points
closed to the axis of symmetry the magnetic ﬁeld is determined by the distance from the axis and the values it
takes on this axis. Demonstration of this result appears in many textbooks [1] and is often left as an exercise;
it consists in giving for each component, the ﬁrst terms of an ascending series in powers of the distance from
the axis.
Whereas the ﬁrst terms are easily found by successive approximations method, the diﬃculty rapidly increases
when we try to derive higher order terms by the same method. The purpose of the following lines is to overcome
this obstacle by a direct derivation of the general terms of each ascending series.

II. DERIVATION

We shall use the cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z) with the z-axis for the symmetry axis. The magnetic ﬁeld,
B, has two components Br and Bθ which depend on r and z. It is searched in regions containing the axis of
symmetry and where current are absent. With this former condition, Maxwell’s equations for the magnetic ﬁeld
reduce to

∇ ∧ B = 0,
∇ · B = 0.

B = ∇φ.

∆φ = 0.

The ﬁrst equation allows the magnetic ﬁeld to be derived from a scalar potential φ deﬁned by

The substitution of Eq. 3 in Eq. 2 leads to Laplace’s equation for the potential

Note that the electrostatic ﬁeld obeys the same equations and the ﬁnal results for the magnetic ﬁeld will thus
be valid for the electrostatic ﬁeld.
In cylindrical coordinates the Laplace’s equation becomes

The integration of the ﬁrst equation gives e±ikz. Solutions of the second equation are Bessel’s functions of the
ﬁrst and second kind with zero order [2], and whose argument, ikr, is purely imaginary 1. The Bessel’s function
of the second kind must be rejected because of its singularity at r = 0. We thus retain only J0, the Bessel’s
function of the ﬁrst kind

leads to the following system of diﬀerential equations where k is the separation parameter

g′′
+ k2g = 0,
r2f ′′ + rf ′ − r2k2f = 0.

f (r) = J0(ikr).

J0(ikr)eikz,

φ(0, z) = ϕ(z).

Now we have the following set of elementary solutions of Eq. (5)

on which we shall expand the potential φ(r, z).
This potential is assumed to be a deﬁnite function on the z-axis, we write therefore

Let’s call ˆϕ(k), the Fourier transform of ϕ(z):

Since we have J0(0) = 1, the potential

ϕ(z) =

ˆϕ(k)eikzdk.

obviously coincides with ϕ on the z-axis and satisﬁes Laplace’s equation.
This solution is with no doubt unique.
Indeed, if we consider the exterior Dirichlet’s problem in which the
potential is known and equals to ϕ on the surface of an inﬁnite cylinder surrounding the z axis, the unique
solution of this problem would tend to our solution when we let the radius of the cylinder tend to zero.
Along the axis of symmetry, the the magnetic ﬁeld has the only component Bz which is supposed to be known.
We thus write

The Fourier transform ˆb(k) of b(z) is related to ˆϕ(k) by

Bz(0, z) = b(z).

ˆb(k) = ik ˆϕ(k).

Making use of the expansion of Eq. (13), we derive the component Bz

Now, we must transform this formula into an expansion containing terms with b(z) and its successive derivatives.
We have, for this purpose, the following ascending series of J0 [2]

The integral is nothing else than the Fourier transform of b(2n)(z), we thus obtain the desired expansion for Bz:

which we report in Eq. (16) after substituting ikr for x; this yields to

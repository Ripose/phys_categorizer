Abstract

It is shown that the universal Newton time may be introduced in the classical electrodynam-
ics. The statement results from an existence of the generalized symmetry of Maxwell equations
with respect to Galilei transformations.
In the case of the extended Galilei transformations
the postulate of invariance of the speed of light may be made compatible with the concept of
the universal Newton time. Some physical consequences of the extended Galilei symmetry are
considered.

1 Introduction

The postulate on the existence of the universal time was entered into physics by Newton in 1687.
Up to the end of the XIXth century this concept perfectly corresponded to the known set of
experimental facts, described by the equations of movement in the classical mechanics both on the
Earth and within the Sun system. It will suﬃce to mention one of the remarkable achievements of
this concept, namely, the prediction of the Neptune’s orbit parameters on the basis of the Uran’s
perturbation study by Le Verrier, 1846. The diﬃculties have begun at the end of the XIXth century
in attempting to make the universal time concept compatible with Maxwell electrodynamics. It is
known from a formally mathematical side that the idea of the universal time is realized in Galilei
transformations:

x′ = x

V t; y′ = y; z′ = z; t′ = t.

−

(1)

Here x, y, z are the space variables, t is the time, V = (V, 0, 0) is the velocity of the inertial
reference K ′ relative to K. While the Newton mechanics equation ma = F is in accordance with
these transformations (invariant with respect to Galilei transformations), Maxwell equations did not
seem to have the similar property. In other words, Maxwell equations, by their mathematical nature
were presented as Galilei non-invariant equations. This point of view is popularized everywhere.
One can ﬁnd this in any university course of general physics. Moreover, it is from resolving the
diﬃculty of Galilei approach in electrodynamics that the special relativity theory (SR) and the
modern relativization of space-time representations have arisen. And now about 90 years after
publishing the fundamental works of Voigt, Larmor, Lorentz, Einstein and Poincar´e we return to
seemingly already resolved problems again.

It was found that a situation is more complicated here, than it is commonly supposed, and
the concept of the Newton time may be also accorded with Maxwell equations. It is important
to determine what we mean by this. For deﬁniteness, by the words ”the concept of the Newton
time may be also accorded with Maxwell equations” we shall mean that vacuum (microscopic)
Maxwell equations possess not only the property of the Lorentz invariance, but also the property
of the invariance with respect to Galilei transformations in some generalized sense. The Galilei
transformations contain the time transformation t′ = t, and the universal Newton time will be
thereby entered automatically into Maxwell equations.

It should be noted that although the relativistic concept was dominant, the research of Galilei
symmetry of Maxwell electrodynamics were carried out after arising SR and are continued at the
present time. As example it is possible to note the publications of Le Bellac and Levi-Leblond

[1] and Fushchich and Nikitin [2]. The authors have established that besides the well known
relativistic and conform symmetry, the ﬁrst and second pair of Maxwell equations, considered
separately, have also the property of invariance with respect to Galilei transformations. The various
linear representations of Galilei group corresponding to the transformations of the ﬁelds E′ = E,
V x E); E′ = (E + VxH), H′ = H are realized on the solutions of these equations [1],
H′ = (H
[2]. (Here the speed of light c is believed equal to unit; E, H are the electrical and magnetic ﬁelds).
So, the situation has considerably been cleared, but the attempt at establishing the property of
Galilei symmetry of Maxwell equations in the total set has not been quite successful. It was made
later in the works [3] - [5], which we shall follow below.

As it is known, they may be brought to a single equation of the second order namely to the
D’Alembert equation with φ

(E, H):

The algebraic equation of the light cone may be brought in correspondence with the diﬀerential
D’Alembert equation:

c2t2

x2 = 0.

Any university course of general physics contains the statement on its Galilei non-invariance. Let
us show by direct calculation that it is not so. For this purpose we use the transformations (1) and
Galilei theorem of velocities addition, recorded for the speed of light:

Here it is taken into account that x = cxt = cnxt. It follows from here that the Galilei transfor-
mations map the sphere x′2 = c′2t′2 with center in the point x′ = y′ = z′ = 0 onto the sphere
x2 = c2t2 with the center in the point x = y = z = 0 just as the Lorentz transformations, which
accords with the relativity principle. The failure in the former considerations consists in the fact
that space and time were transformed according to Galilei but the speed of light was transformed
according to Lorentz. Such inconsistency has resulted to incorrect conclusion that the relativity
principle is violated at joint consideration of the ratios (1) and (4). In the fact the light cone equa-
tion is invariant with respect to Galilei transformations. This circumstance prompts to consider
the symmetric properties of D’Alembert equation more carefully.

2

In accordance with theoretical-algebraic deﬁnition of the symmetry [6], let us consider the
commutational ratios of the Lie algebra generators of Galilei group with the D’Alembert operator.
We have [3]:

[2, p0] = [2, pk] = [2, Jk] = 0; [2[2, Hk] = 0.

−

i∂k Jk = (xxp)k, Hk =

tpk, k = 1, 2, 3, x1,2,3 = x, y, z. It follows from here
Here p0 = i∂t, pk =
that the Lie algebra of Galilei group is the invariance algebra of the free Maxwell equations. Hence,
the set of ﬁeld transformations should exist which will transform into themselves the equations (2)
in combination with the Galilei transformations (1). The task is to ﬁnd them. For this we record
the sought transformations as:

−

E′
E′
E′

H ′
1 = Φ(x, t)E1;
2 = Φ(x, t)a(E2 + h23H3); H ′
3 = Φ(x, t)a(E3 + h32H2); H ′

1 = Φ(x, t)H1;
2 = Φ(x, t)a(H2 + e23E3);
3 = Φ(x, t)a(H3 + e32E2),

where Φ(x, t) is some weight function. Let us express the Galilei transformations in variables
x0 = ct, x = (x1, x2, x3):

′ = γx0; x1

′ = x1 −

βx0; x2

′ = x2; x3

′ = x3; c′ = γc,

2βn1 + β2)1/2, n = c/c = (n1, n2, n3), β = V /c, and produce the replacement of
where γ = (1
the variables in the equations (2), (3) taking into account the relations (8) and the relationships
between the derivatives:

Let us use the concept of the generalized symmetry [7] and require that the initial equations
should be transformed into themselves due to the compatibility of the set of engaging equations
(the conditions of transformation into themselves and the ﬁnal equations), where the conditions of
transformation into themselves are obtained by means of replacement of the variables (8) and (10)
in Maxwell equations (2).

which correspond to the matrix law of multiplying the matrices of ﬁeld transformations in going
to primed variables. The formulas (22) are completely analogous to the formula of the relativistic
theorem of velocities addition and also arise in multiplying the matrices from the Lorentz group.
From this and due to the presence of the local weight function Φ(x, t) (14) it can be concluded
that the matrices of the ﬁeld transformations (20) form the projective representation of the Lorentz
group [8] on the solutions as plane waves of D’Alembert equation. It is similar to the projective
Galilei group representations realizing on the solutions as plane waves of Schr¨odinger equation in
Quantum theory [9], [10], and it is also the unexpected circumstance in the symmetry theory of
Maxwell equations. But the similar cases are known.

For example, as early as 1909, Cunningham [11] showed that the inversion group I: xν ′ =
xν/x2 (x2 = x02
x2, x0 = ct) in Minkowski space induces the electromagnetic ﬁeld transforma-

tions, which can be described through a matrix of Lorentz group representation D(L) with the

(27)

with the weight function Ψ and the group parameters a, e23, h23 from the expressions (14) and (19).
We have an analogy with the result [11] exception that the weight function x4 in the expression
(25) has a universal character, but in the formula (27) the weight function is determined by a
concrete solution of Maxwell equations; besides the Lorentz, Inversion groups are the subgroups of
the conformal group O(2, 4) and the Lorentz, Galilei groups are the subgroups of the O(2, 5) group
[13].

In sum, the formulas (20) and (27) reﬂect the fact that the electromagnetic ﬁelds may be
classiﬁed through their transformation properties under the Lorentz group. The given property of
electromagnetic ﬁeld was also investigated in the paper [7] as evidence of the symmetry of Maxwell
equations, conditioned by existence of the second order commutational ratios [2[2, Hk]] = 0, where
Hk are the generators of Galilei group, k = 1, 2, 3, 2 is D’Alembert operator.

So, according to the result received, we may say that the well known Lorentz-symmetry of
Maxwell equation is realized on the true representations of Lorentz group [8]; on the projective
representations of Lorentz group the Galilei-symmetry of these equations is realized.

We also note that if the guiding vector is n = (1, 0, 0), the ﬁeld transformations is reduced to

It is not diﬃcult to see that the part of Galilei-invariants coincides with Lorentz-invariants. How-
ever, the distinctions are also observed. They are caused by the distinction in transformational
properties of the appropriate values. For example, formulas of transformation of the zero vector

They diﬀerently describe the Doppler eﬀect in electrodynamics.

Let us consider the approximation of the small speeds. At the small speeds, when β << 1, for
both the relativistic and Galilean cases the common formulas of ﬁeld transformations are realized:

E′ = E + VxH/c; H′ = H

−

They are known as the Galilean limit. In the present work this term has a conditional character, as
the formulas are the limit both for the relativistic and nonrelativistic ﬁeld variables transformations.
The situation here is analogous to the case with independent variables:

x′ = x

V t, y′ = y, z′ = z, t′ = t, c′ = c.

These transformations being neither Galilean, nor relativistic are the limit ratios both for the Galilei
and relativistic cases.

in the Galilean and relativistic cases respectively. Their principle distinction consists in the absence
of real ﬁelds in the relativistic case if β > 1.

We also note, that in the relativistic theory the transformation parameters of the ﬁeld variables
do not depend on the kind of ﬁeld. Owing to this fact these transformations have global nature in

the space of solutions. In Galilean case, the transformation parameters and the weight functions
in space of solutions are determined by the concrete ﬁeld. In this sense the Galilean ﬁeld trans-
formations are non linear. Just this circumstance is the reason why Galilean symmetry and the
associated concept of the Newton time in electrodynamics so long slipped oﬀ from researchers, as
for all the cases, except [3] - [5], the ﬁeld transformations were being searched in the class of the
linear transformations.

These are the mathematical consequences from the introductions of the Newton time in elec-
trodynamics. It is natural the question of the physical consequences arises as well. We consider
only some of them.

If we admit in the framework of Galilei transformations, that the speed of light is equal
3.1010cm/s with respect to an emitter (Ritz hypothesis [14]), according to the Galilean theorem of
velocities addition the speed of light should depend on the velocity of movement of the emitter. How-
ever such eﬀects have not been found in the specially carried out experiments. (Bonch-Bruevitch
and Molchanov, 1956; Alv¨ager, Nilsson and Kjellman, 1963; James and Sternberg, 1963; Sadeh,
1963; Filippas and Fox, 1964; Alv¨ager, Farley, Kjellman and Wallin, 1964; Babcock and Bergman,
1964). It is possible to overcome the marked diﬃculty, when we assume that the speed of light is
equal 3.1010cm/s not with respect to an emitter, but with respect to an observer [3]. For this case,
the relationship between the speed of light and the velocity of the emitter is eliminated, but it is
necessary to assume that any emitter beforehand knows, with which the speed it should radiate the
light that the speed of this light relative to any observer would have the required value 3.1010cm/s.
This hypothesis and the experiments connected with it have been discussed in the paper [3]. Here
we consider an another approach.

3 The extended Galilei transformations

The extended Galilei group G11 may be deﬁned as the set of linear space-time transformations

x′ = ̺(Rx + Vt) + a, t′ = t + b,

where R is the matrix of the 3-dimensional spatial rotations; V is the velocity of the inertial
reference frame K ′ relative to K; ̺ is the scale parameter. The transformations induced are
deﬁned in 4-dimensional real space E3

with s = V/V , n = c/c, β = V /c. Then the extended Galilei transformations (34) will be
compatible both with the concept of the universal Newton time t′ = t and with the postulate of
invariance of the speed of light because we may conclude from the theorem of velocities addition that
c′ = c in the given case. Owing to this fact, for the particular case when Rkl = δkl, V = (V, 0, 0),

Hence, in accordance with the principle of relativity the extended Galilei transformations (38)
transform the sphere of radius R′ = c′t′ with center x′ = y′ = z′ = 0 to the sphere with the same
radius R = ct = c′t′ = R′ and center x = y = z = 0. The speed of light c′ transforms to the same
speed of light c = c′. The sum of square of guiding cosines turns to unit. We obtain an analogy with
SR. We also note that in the framework of extended Galilei transformations (38) the consecutive
explanation of the basic relativistic experiments is possible. Let us consider these explanations
following the papers [3], [5].

4 The elements of physical interpretation

4.1 Similar to SR interpretation of observations

The Michelson experiment. Let the test run with the terrestrial light source, System K. Then
by virtue of isotropy of 3-space the speed of light c will be the same in all directions. Therefore, for
a terrestrial observer immobile with respect to an interferometer, the interference pattern will not
be changed when the interferometer is rotated. Then let the test run with an extraterrestrial source
of light, System K’. In this case, due to the transformational property c’=c -inv the speed of light
in the system K, i.e. on the Earth, turns out to be equal c and will coincide with the speed of light
from the terrestrial source. Therefore, experiments with terrestrial and extraterrestrial sources of
light are indistinguishable physically, and the interference pattern will not be changed in our case
as in SR.

Test to check independence of the speed of light from velocity of the light source. As
in SR, all these experiments will lead to negative results since c′ = c.

In Galilean approach the twin paradox do not exist because of universal

Tests to measure lifetimes of fast nonstable particles. In the framework of transformations
(38) it is necessary to admit, that instead of the eﬀect of the time retardation the movement with
superrelativistic velocity should exist. For example, the velocity of atmospheric µ -mesons should
be equal to

Let us also note, that the considered example is not the only case when a quasar has the value
of redshift z > 1. According to [16], the number of these quasars is great enough, for example,
the quasars LB8796 z=1.320, PKS z=2.170, PHL957 z=2.690, OQ172 z=3.530, etc. It is known

Here the value v′ = c has the invariance property only for the case of such phenomenon as the
propagation of the light. If v′

Therefore the limiting speed of propagation of all interactions in the approach (38) do not exist.
The interactions having the nature other than the electromagnetic one may propagate with velocity
distinct from the value c = 3

·

The point-behaviour of elementary particles. The elementary particles should be points in
the relativistic physics because of the ﬁnite speed of propagation of all interactions. In Galilean
physics this requirement may be removed because of the absence of the limiting speed of interactions
propagation.

It is shown that in the frame of the generalized symmetry approach [7] Maxwell equations are
invariant with respect to Galilei transformations and admit the existence of the universal Newton
time. In the case of the extended Galilei transformations the postulate of the universal Newton
time may be made compatible with the concept of invariance of the speed of light. The Galilei
symmetry of Maxwell equation means that the Galilei relativity principle may be realized not only
in the classical mechanics but in the classical electrodynamics too.

From Superluminal Velocity To Time Machines?

G. Nimtz∗, A.A. Stahlhofen†, and A. Haibel∗

February 2, 2008

Various experiments have shown superluminal group and signal velocities recently. Ex-

periments were essentials carried out with microwave tunnelling [1], with frustrated total

internal reﬂection [2], and with gain-assisted anomalous dispersion [3]. According to text

books a superluminal signal velocity violates Einstein causality implying that cause and

eﬀect can be changed and time machines known from science ﬁction could be constructed.

This naive analysis, however, assumes a signal to be a point in the time dimension ne-

glecting its ﬁnite duration. A signal is not presented by a point nor by its front, but by

its total length. On the other hand a signal energy is ﬁnite thus its frequency band is

limited, the latter is a fundamental physical property in consequence of ﬁeld quantiza-

tion with quantum hν. All superluminal experiments have been carried out with rather

narrow frequency bands. The narrow band width is a condition sine qua non to avoid

pulse reshaping of the signal due to the dispersion relation of the tunnelling barrier or of

the excited gas, respectively [4]. In consequence of the narrow frequency band width the

time duration of the signal is long so that causality is preserved. However, superluminal

signal velocity shortens the otherwise luminal time span between cause and eﬀect.

Can a signal travel faster than light? If this happens, would it really violate the principle of causality

stating that cause precedes eﬀect [5, 6]? The latter statement has been widely assumed as a matter

of fact. It has been shown according to the theory of special relativity that a signal velocity faster

than light allows to change the past. The line of arguments how to manipulate the past in this case

is illustrated in Fig. 1 [6, 7]. There are two frames of reference displayed. In the ﬁrst one at the time

t = 0 lottery numbers are presented, whereas at t = -10 ps the counters were closed. Mary (A) sends

the lottery numbers to her friend Susan (B) with a signal velocity twice the velocity of light. Susan

moving in the second inertial system at a relative speed of 0.75c, sends the data back at an even faster

speed of 4c, which arrives in the ﬁrst system at t = -50 ps, thus in time to deliver the correct lottery

numbers before the counters close at t = -10 ps.

Figure 1: Coordinates of two observers A (0,0) and B with O(x,t) and O’(x’,t’) moving with a relative
velocity of 0.75c. The distance L between A and B is 0.1 m. A has available a signal velocity v =
2c and B v’= 4c. Taking into consideration a ﬁnite signal duration, the lottery fraud is impossible as
shown in Fig. 3. (The numbers in the example are chosen according to [6].)

The time shift of a point on the time coordinate into the past is given by the relation [6]:

tA = −

L
c

(c − c/N − c/N ′ + vr/N N ′)

(c − vr/N )

,

(1)

where L is the transmission length of the signal, vr is the relative velocity of the two inertial systems A

and B, and Nc, N’c are the signal velocities in A and B, respectively. N and N’ are numbers assumed

to be > 1.

This is an example often encountered in the literature supposed to show that a superluminal signal

velocity results in negative times and allows to manipulate the past. We show now that this simple

model is not correct.

First we are going to recall the basic properties of a signal. Microwave pulses [1, 8] and quite recently

light pulses [3] of frequency ν and bandwidth ∆ν have been shown to travel at a velocity much faster

than light. The pulses in the two experiments correspond to signals used nowadays in telephone

as well as in inter-computer communication. Frequency band limitation of signals, the basis of the

sampling theorem [9], is a backbone of digital communication technology discussed in detail in the

literature (e.g.

in Encyclopedia Britannica), but scarcely addressed to in textbooks of physics. The

ﬁnite energy content of a signal actually implies the frequency band limitation [4]. This fundamental

physical property is in consequence of the energy of any frequency components of a signal to be nhν

where n is a whole number, h the Planck constant, and ν the frequency.

A pulse represents an amplitude modulated (AM) signal on a carrier frequency. The carrier frequency

is in charge of the receivers address and the half-width of the pulse represents the number of digits,

i.e. the information. In the case of modern ﬁber optics the relative frequency band width is 10−3

approximately, in the superluminal microwave experiments the band width was 10−1 and in the optical

experiment mentioned above it was less than 10−9. Due to the narrow frequency bands there was

no signiﬁcant pulse reshaping neither in the microwave tunnelling experiment nor in the gain-assisted

light propagation experiment. The superluminal signals are shown together with the luminal reference

signals in Fig. 2.

Figure 2: Display of the superluminal gain–assisted optical pulses (left [3]) and tunnelled microwave
(right [8]). The pulses are normalized and compared with the air born or the wave-guided signals.
The measured velocities have been –310c and 4.7c, respectively.

Thus in both experiments the signal travelled at a superluminal velocity, e.g. with 4.7c [8] or with

–310c [3], respectively. Nevertheless, the principle of causality has not been violated in both experi-

ments.

In the example with the lottery data the signal was assumed to be a point on the time coordinate.

However, a signal has a ﬁnite duration as the pulse sketched along the time coordinate in Fig. 3. (In

the experiments in question 7.5µs and 5 ns, see Fig. 2.) Any information like a word has a ﬁnite

extension on the time coordinate. In the two cited superluminal experiments the superluminal time

shift compared with the pulse length is about 30% in the microwave experiment with the velocity 4.7c

and about 1 % in the light experiment with the velocity –310c. Due to the signal’s ﬁnite duration

of 200 ps the information is obtained only at positive times under the assumptions as illustrated in

Figure 3: In contrast to Fig. 1 the pulse has a ﬁnite duration of 200 ps. This data is used for a clear
demonstration of the eﬀect. (In both experiments, the pulse length is extremely long compared with
measured time shift in consequence of the superluminal signal velocity as shown in Fig. 2.)

Fig. 3. The same holds a fortiori for the two discussed experiments. The ﬁnite duration of a signal is

the reason that a superluminal velocity does not violate the principle of causality. On the other hand

a shorter signal corresponds to a broader frequency band. In consequence of the dispersion relation

of either a tunnelling barrier or of an excited atomic gas with an extremely narrow frequency regime

of anomalous dispersion strong pulse reshaping would occur. Summing up, the principle of causality

has not been violated by the experiments with superluminal signal velocities, but amazing the time

span between cause and eﬀect has been reduced compared with luminal propagation.

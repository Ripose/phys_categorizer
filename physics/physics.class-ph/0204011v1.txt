Non-extensive Boltzmann Equilibration Dynamics

(Dated: April 3, 2002)

We propose a novel approach in the study of transport phenomena in dense systems or systems
with long range interactions where multiple particle interactions must be taken into consideration.
In addition to the two body collision dynamics introduced by means of the Boltzmann equation,
we study the inﬂuence of other interacting particles in terms of a random distortion of energy
and momentum conservation occurring when multi-particle interactions are considered as binary
collisions. Energy and momentum conservation still holds exactly but not in each model binary
collision. We show how this new system diﬀers from the Boltzmann system, and derive the shape
of the resulting equilibrium distribution in an idealized system.

PACS numbers: 05.70.-a, 05.20.-y, 05.30.-d, 05.60.-k

The Boltzmann equation [1] for a spatially independent
system of particles describes the evolution of the one par-
ticle momentum ~p distribution f (~p, t) of a “foreground”
particle with mass m subject to interactions (here as-
sumed to be number conserving) with N “background”
particles j = 1, . . . , N with masses m1, m2, . . . , mN . In
classical, non-relativistic regimes, the Boltzmann equa-
tion takes the form

where we have suppressed a possible time dependence in
the transition rate W (~p, ~p ′), the rate per unit time of the
foreground particle making a momentum transition from
~p to ~p ′ due to interactions with the background particles.
In applications, the Boltzmann equation is restricted to
suﬃciently rareﬁed systems with short range interactions
so that only two particle interactions (two body or binary
collisions) are incorporated into the transition rate [2].
For these systems, the transition rate is given by [3]

where the energies are given by Ep = |~p |2/2m and Eqj =
| ~qj|2/2mj, bj( ~qj , t) is the momentum ~qj distribution for
background particle j, and (σv)j is the diﬀerential cross
section for the scattering of the foreground particle with
a background particle j.

No satisfactory generalization of the transition rates
has been given to describe transport phenomena in dense
systems or systems with long range interactions, that is,
to non-extensive systems where multiple particle interac-
tions must be taken into consideration [4].

In calculating the transition rate that the foreground
particle with momentum ~p will make a transition to mo-
mentum ~p ′ in rareﬁed systems with short range interac-
tions due to an interaction with particle j, we ﬁnd the

′

expectation of a background particle j having an incom-
ing momentum ~qj (hence, the integral over the distri-
bution of j) and outgoing momentum ~qj
which satisfy
the two-body conservation of energy and momentum re-
′ and Ep + Eqj = Ep ′ + Eq′
lations ~p + ~qj = ~p ′ + ~qj
.
j
That is, we integrate over all suitable incoming momenta
′ which enables the desired
~qj and outgoing momenta ~qj
reaction to occur, i.e., which makes the desired reaction
physically possible. Thus, the form of the total transi-
tion rate of the foreground particle making a transition
~p → ~p ′ follows from the assumption that the transition
rate is proportional to the sum over all background par-
ticles j of 1) the expectation of a collision between the
foreground particle and the background particle j and 2)
the expectation of the desired reaction (~p, ~qj → ~p ′, ~qj
′)
being physically possible (i.e., the expectation of the con-
servation of energy and momentum constraints).

A natural generalization of the transition rates is to as-
sume that the transition rate is proportional to the sum
over collections of background particles of 1) the expec-
tation of a collision between the foreground particle and a
collection of background particles and 2) the expectation
of the conservation of energy and momentum constraint.
In dense systems or systems with long range interactions,
for the transition ~p → ~p ′ of the foreground particle to be
physically possible, we in fact need global conservation
of momentum and energy:

and note that there is no clear way of systematically
generalizing the Boltzmann equation by adding succes-
sive multi-particle-interaction correction terms (which
are generally divergent) in any system. Attempts to gen-
eralize the Boltzmann equation for “moderately” dense
systems have focused on rearranging the divergent cor-
rection terms to produce eﬀective cutoﬀs and these eﬀorts
have largely been abandoned.

However, singling out the dominant role that a sin-
gle background particle j plays in making the transition

2

physically possible, we write the above constraints as

~p + ~qj = ~p

+ ~qj + ~ǫ

Ep + Eqj = Ep′ (2γ − 1) + Eq′

(6)

Here, we have simply pushed all of the complexity of
computing multiple scattering transition rates into com-
puting the distributions of the random vector ~ǫ and the
random variable γ. We note that the form of the con-
straints is arbitrary and, when combined with Eqs. (3)
and (4), serves as a deﬁning relation for the variables ~ǫ
and γ. The above form is chosen here as such for mathe-
matical convenience and to be suggestive of the standard
way in which an apparent non-conservation of momen-
tum is measured in terms of a displacement vector and

the way in which an apparent non-conservation of energy
is measured in terms of an absorption factor. Thus, in
dense systems or systems with long range interactions,
for the transition to be “due” to an interaction with par-
ticle j, we need a foreground-background binary interac-
tion as before, but with modiﬁed energy and momentum
constraints.
In this manner, we can interpret the to-
tal transition rate as being proportional to the sum over
all particles j of the γ and ~ǫ expectations of 1) the ex-
pectation of a foreground-background particle collision
and 2) the expectation of the modiﬁed constraint. The
transition rates for dense systems or systems with long
range interactions are then given by simply replacing the
δ-functions appearing in Eq. (2) according to:

δ3(~p + ~qj − ~p

− ~qj
δ(Ep + Eqj − Ep′ − Eq′

) → hhδ3(~p + ~qj − ~p

In this characterization of non-extensive dynamics the
form of the transition rate is familiar and many aspects
of the distributions are immediately clear from their def-
initions. As the density of a system and/or the range
of interactions decrease, hhγiiγ → 1, hh~ǫii~ǫ → ~0 and
Var(γ) → 0, Var(~ǫ) → ~0 for only two particle collisions
are increasingly present. Clearly, our transition rates
simplify to the usual binary transition rates for rareﬁed
systems with short range interactions and thus, incorpo-
rate the successes of the Boltzmann equation in describ-
ing transport phenomena in these systems. However, as
the density of a system and/or as the range of inter-
actions increase, Var(γ) and Var(~ǫ) increase. For such
physically relevant systems, the success of our proposed
non-extensive generalization to the Boltzmann equation
will be made evident by indicating how our generalization
determines generalized equilibration dynamics which dif-
fer from canonical equilibration dynamics and how our
generalization very naturally reproduces experimentally
measured equilibrium transport phenomena.

In an interaction involving a foreground particle and
a background particle j we can interpret the presence of
other interacting background particles in dense systems
or systems with long range interactions as providing a
mechanism for carrying oﬀ or providing the additional
momentum and/or energy necessary to make transitions
physically possible. Thus the distributions of ~ǫ and γ
express the likelihood of such mechanisms being present.
As such we can proceed as if the transition rate were
the usual transition rate in a system in which only bi-
nary collisions occur which do not necessarily conserve
energy and momentum. The interactions between the

foreground particle and the background particle j are of
the form ~p → ~p ′ and ~qj → ~q ′
j and ~ǫ and γ denote the
non-conservation of energy and momentum. That is, ~ǫ
and γ denote the extent to which the conservation of
momentum and energy appear to be violated in a given
interaction–similar to what is done for inelastic collisions.
In such a system, a desired transition ~p → ~p ′ due to a
foreground-background interaction is physically possible
for every allowed value of γ and ~ǫ.

Not only do these two interpretations aid us in under-
standing the nature of the γ and ~ǫ distributions, but we
see that by extending our original deﬁnitions of ~ǫ and γ,
the form of our transition rates is applicable to a very
large class of systems: with elastic and/or inelastic inter-
actions (here deﬁned generally to incorporate all inter-
actions which do not conserve energy and momentum),
with low or high number densities, with short and/or long
range interactions, and with any mechanisms which can
carry oﬀ or provide additional momentum and energy to
particles.

Indeed, for general systems, the calculation of the ~ǫ
and γ distributions has become even more complicated.
However, we can very easily study transport phenomena
which result from certain classes of ~ǫ and γ distributions
which we expect to be present in many physically rele-
vant systems. For instance, in many systems, we might
expect ~ǫ and γ to be peaked distributions about ~ǫ = ~0
and γ = 1 and independent of the incoming and out-
going momenta and energies (so that we interpret the
inﬂuence of other interacting particles, unaccounted in-
teraction processes and mechanisms as producing a ran-
dom noise distortion of the conservation of energy and

momentum constraints). In particular, we might expect
~ǫ to have a spherically symmetric (and perhaps normal)
distribution about ~ǫ = ~0. Moreover, since the family of
Gamma distributions has a rich variety of shapes and
can approximate many classes of distributions, in many
systems we might expect the distribution of γ to be well
approximated by a Gamma distribution (especially when
γ predominantly takes on values near unity as we expect
to be the case for most physically relevant systems) with
parameters α and λ:

fγ(γ) =

λ(λγ)α−1e−λγ
Γ(α)

where the average and variance of γ are

Var(γ) ≡ hhγ2iiγ − hhγii2

To analytically illustrate some immediate results of our
proposed generalization, we consider a system of N clas-
sical background particles denoted by j = 1, ..., N with
mass mj. Suppose further that the interactions are com-
pletely elastic and that the number density of the system
and the range of the interactions are suﬃciently small to
guarantee that the momentum distribution of the back-
ground particle j = 1, ..., N approaches the Boltzmann
equilibrium distribution with a common temperature T
(measured in units of energy):

j (qj) = Cj e

(12)

where Cj is a normalization constant. After the N par-
ticles are suﬃciently equilibrated, we inject a foreground
particle with mass m ≫ mj for all background particles
j = 1, ..., N and an initial distribution f (~p, t = 0). Sup-
pose that multi-particle collisions between the foreground
and background particles occur (for instance, as the di-
ameter of the foreground particle is much larger than
the diameter of the background particles or if the range
of interaction is larger for a foreground-background in-
teraction than for a background-background interaction)
and/or that the interactions are inelastic. Thus, the dis-
tributions of γ and ~ǫ exhibit variation. Further, suppose
(σv)j is constant as in the case of hard sphere interac-
tions. We also suppose that the background particles
are suﬃcient in extent (i.e., the background is an ideal
heat bath) so that we may assume that the background
approximately remains in equilibrium during the evolu-
tion of the foreground particle. Therefore, the time de-
pendent momentum distribution f (~p, t) satisﬁes Eq. (1),
where the transition rate is given by

The Tsallis equilibrium distribution is often successfully
used to model equilibrium distributions exhibiting power-
tail behavior. Furthermore, Tsallis-like distributions are
extensively measured in many physical systems, espe-
cially in systems with long range interactions.

We note that our approach diﬀers from [6] which ob-
tained a Tsallis distribution from a generalization of the
Boltzmann equation.
In particular, our approach does
not,
in general, guarantee exact Tsallis equilibration.
However, we retain the intuitive statistical form of Boltz-
mann’s molecular chaos hypothesis, transport equation,
and transition rates. We also found within our approach
the modiﬁed H-theorem with non-extensive entropy, but
we defer the presentation of the proof.

Concluding, we have proposed a straight forward ex-
tension of Boltzmann equilibration dynamics to model
transport phenomena in non-extensive, non-equilibrium
systems. Our formulation resulted from our interpreta-
tion of the inﬂuence of other interacting particles as a
random distortion of energy and momentum conserva-
tion occurring when multiple interactions are considered
as binary collisions. This also explains the appearance
of Tsallis distribution in [7], where local energy conser-
vation was not maintained.

In outlook, we noted that our formalism is applicable
to a very large class of systems: with elastic and/or in-
elastic interactions, with low or high number densities,
with short and/or long range interactions, and with any
mechanisms which can carry oﬀ or provide additional
momentum and energy to particles. We also indicated
how the result of our proposed generalization can be de-
termined in systems by studying classes of reasonable
distributions for the proposed parameters of our gener-
alization. Although we have only considered a system
where we could easily and explicitly determine some im-
mediate results, our approach is easily extended to more
general systems (indeed, we already have similar results
for a relativistic, quantum mechanical foreground parti-
cle scattering in a thermal background of light relativistic
particles) and it is clear that the general situation is sim-
ilar. That is, our model incorporates more of the (long
since neglected) physics of equilibrating systems and is
able to reproduce and naturally explain the appearance
of deviations from the canonical near-steady state distri-
butions like those extensively measured in many physical
systems throughout nature.

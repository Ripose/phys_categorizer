Abstract

The possibility to derive an equation for the mean velocity ﬁeld in
turbulent ﬂow by using classical statistical mechanics is investigated. An
application of projection operator technique available in the literature is
used for this purpose. It is argued that the hydrodynamic velocity deﬁned
there, in situations where the ﬂuid is turbulent, is to be interpreted as
the mean velocity ﬁeld; in that case, the momentum component of the
generalized transport equation derived there is the mean velocity equation.
In this paper, stationary incompressible ﬂow for constant mass den-
sity and temperature is considered. The stress tensor is obtained as a
nonlinear functional of the mean velocity ﬁeld, the linear part of which
is the Stokes tensor. The formula contains a time correlation function
in local equilibrium. Presently, there exists a microscopic theory for time
correlations in total equilibrium only. For this reason and as a preliminary
measure, the formula has been expanded into a power series in the mean
velocity; though this limits the applicability to low Reynolds number ﬂow.
The second order term has been evaluated in a former paper of the au-
thor. For the third order term, the form of the kernel function is derived.
Its calculation with the aid of the mode-coupling theory is completed; it
will be reported in an separate paper. An numerical application with the
data of the circular jet is under way.

1 Introduction

In turbulence experiments, very often the relevant variables - those which can
be related to the external conditions of the experiment - are not the actual

1

quantities but their mean values. The process is then described by a statistical
theory. It is well known that it can be very diﬃcult to derive equations for mean
values which are closed. It can be argued that the reason is that it is diﬃcult
to construct the multi-point probability distribution for the process.

In this paper, the possibility to derive an equation for the mean velocity ﬁeld
in turbulent ﬂow by using classical statistical mechanics is investigated. Then,
in principle the probability distribution of the process can always be constructed
starting from the total equilibrium distribution. On the other hand, it will be
macroscopic and microscopic parts of the
necessary to distinguish between
motion and to formulate the latter in a way suitable for hydrodynamic purpose.
It is known that the Navier-Stokes equation can be derived from Statistical
Mechanics. This has been performed ﬁrst by Chapman and Enskog in 1916 and
1917, with the Boltzmann equation as a starting point; see, e. g., Huang [1].
More recently, a formalism has been developed which starts from the Liouville
equation and applies projection operator technique; see Zwanzig [2], Mori [3].
Here, the presentation of Grabert [4] is used as a reference. In the relevant
part of this work, a generalized transport equation is derived; the application
for simple ﬂuids and a suitable approximation of the stress tensor lead to the
Navier-Stokes equation.
In the present paper, arguments are given that for
situations where the ﬂuid ﬂow is turbulent, the momentum component of the
generalized transport equation for simple ﬂuids actually is the mean velocity
equation. The formulation is restricted to stationary ﬂow in incompressible
ﬂuid of constant density and temperature.

In section 2, some deﬁnitions of Statistical Mechanics and the basic steps
which lead to the generalized transport equation are referenced from [4]. The
interpretation of the momentum component as the mean velocity equation is
explained.
It is known that the form of this equation is very similar to the
Navier-Stokes equation, with an additional friction force term (Reynolds force).
There are numerous approaches to formulate this quantity (see, e. g., [5] and
the references therein); it is seen that it is nonlinear in the velocity and, after all
evidence, also nonlocal. - As a preliminary measure, the friction force has been
expanded into a power series in the velocity; though this limits the application
to low Reynolds number ﬂow. This is explained in section 3. The main results
for the 2nd order term reported earlier [6], [7] are quoted; the calculation of the
formula for the 3rd order term is presented in this paper.

2 Mean velocity equation

In this section, the deﬁnitions and the basic steps of the derivation of the gen-
eralized transport equation are referenced from Grabert [4]; the notation is
slightly diﬀerent. The ﬂuid is considered to be a system of N particles of mass
m with positions yj and velocities vj (simple ﬂuid) which are combined to the
phase space vector z. Vector components are described by Latin indices, e. g.
yj = {yja} . The particles interact with a symmetric, short-ranged, pairwise
additive interparticle potential. The system is enclosed in a box of Volume V .

2

A function g(z) is called a phase space function, or microscopic variable. Espe-
cially, we need the space densities of the conserved quantities particle number,
energy and momentum n, e, p which are collected to a 5-element linear matrix
a . They are functions of an additional space variable x:

For the particle functions

pj = mvj , while the en-
ergy function contains the interparticle potential. The quantities a obey the
conservation relations:

nj = 1 ,

e

e

The ﬂuxes s have the same general structure as the a (2.1); the particle
functions can be found in [4]; especially, we have s1 = p/m . The time evolution
of any phase space function g is described by the Liouville equation:

iL is the Liouville operator, a linear diﬀerential operator the form of which
can be found in any textbook of statistical mechanics. From (2.3), the formal
solution for g(t) given the initial value g is:

In the statistical model, z and N are considered random variables; that is,
the probability density f (z, N ) is of grand canonical type. The ensemble mean
value (expectation) of a phase space function g is deﬁned in the ‘Heisenberg’
picture:

hgi(t) =

dzg(z, N, t)f (z, N )

(2.5)

∞

Z

XN =1

In this formula, f (z, N ) is the initial probability distribution, and g(z, N, t)
is the value of g at time t if the initial positions and velocities of the particles
are described by z . The operation (integration + Summation) is sometimes
indicated by the symbol ‘tr’:

tr{Ω} =

dzΩ(z, N )

(2.6)

Certain probability densities (also called distributions here) are frequently
used in the analysis. One of them is the (total) equilibrium distribution which
corresponds to macroscopic rest:

f0 = ψ(N ) exp(Φ0 + β(µN − H(z)))

Here, h is Planck’s constant, β = 1/(kBT ) , kB being Boltzmann’s constant
and T the temperature, µ is the chemical potential which is a function of mass
density and temperature, and H(z) is Hamilton’s function which describes the
total energy of the ﬂuid. For the normalization constant, we have Φ0 = −βP V ,
P being the equilibrium pressure. Expectations with respect to the equilibrium
distribution are denoted by hi0. In case of a simple ﬂuid, the ’relevant probability
distribution’ of Grabert’s formalism (see [4], sec. 2.2) is the local equilibrium
distribution:

fL(t) = ψ(N ) exp(Φ(t) − a(z) ∗ b(t)),

b = {β(

u2 − µ), β, −βu},

Φ(t) = − log(tr{ψ exp(−a ∗ b(t))}).

(2.8b)

(2.8c)

Here the symbol ∗ is introduced for the operation: Multiplication, plus Sum-
mation over the 5 elements of the linear matrices a , b, plus Integration over
geometrical space. The elements of b are called the conjugate parameters; they
are functions of the quantities β , µ and u which we will sometimes call the
thermodynamic parameters. β = 1/(kT ), with k being Boltzmann’s constant
and T the absolute temperature; µ is the chemical potential which is a function
of temperature and pressure, and u is the hydrodynamic velocity. These quan-
tities will be considered slowly varying functions of space and time. The b are
deﬁned such that the expectations of the a are identical to their expectations
in local equilibrium:

hai = haiL

(2.9)

The projection operator techniqe (POT) is a means for separating macro-
scopic and microscopic parts of the random variables. It starts by deﬁning the
set of phase space functions which are relevant for the description of the process.
For simple ﬂuids, this set is identiﬁed with the densities of conserved variables,
a . A projection operator
is deﬁned which projects out of any microscopic
variable g the part which is proportional to the relevant variables. It reads:

Pg = hgiL + hg δaiL ∗ hδa δai−1

Here, δa = a − haiL; hi−1

L ∗ δa
L denotes the inverse of the expectation matrix in
the formula. For stationary ﬂow, P is time independent. The analysis in [4]
starts by splitting the exponential operator (2.4):

(2.10)

This corresponds to [4] , formula (2.4.1), specialized to stationary ﬂow, where
especially P =const(t). With (2.11), the Liouville equation (2.3) is reformulated:

By averaging over the initial probability density, and after some manipula-
tions, Grabert’s generalized transport equation [4], (2.5.17) ist obtained. Below,
this equation is presented for stationary ﬂow in simple ﬂuids. It is postulated in
POT that the initial probability density is of the form of the relevant probability
density. Grabert states that this should not be considered a general restriction
of the method but a means to form the general particle system into the type
specially considered; see [4], sec. 2.2 . In [4], sec. 8.3, it is shown that for sim-
ple ﬂuids the relevant probability density is that of local equilibrium. For the
present approach this means that turbulent ﬂow is considered which initially de-
veloped from laminar ﬂow with suitable velocity gradient. - It is a consequence
of this postulate that the last term in (2.12) vanishes after averaging. Moreover,
it is shown that:

In the last step, the conservation relations (2.2) are introduced. Station-
ary ﬂow is considered to be the process described by the generalized transport
equation under stationary conditions and for very large times. One obtains:

Latin and greek indices run over 3 and 5 values, respectively; this is some-
times expressed by saying that, e. g., the index α ’runs over 1, 2 and the latin
index a’. Eqs. (2.14), (2.15) correspond to [4], (8.1.13), (8.5.1) for stationary
ﬂow. From these, now the momentum equation is taken, for which one obtains
([4], (8.4.15)):

hsaciL = ρuauc + P δac

Here, δac is the Kronecker symbol, ρ the mass density and u the ﬂuid velocity

deﬁned by:

([4], (8.3.12)). At this point, the continuity equation is introduced. This ac-
tually is the mass density component of (2.14), and for incompressible constant
density ﬂow it reduces to:

hpi = ρu

∇ · u = 0

With these formulas and (2.8b), (2.14), (2.15) obtain their ﬁnal form:

(2.19)

(2.21)

(2.22)

It is seen immediately that (2.20) is the hydrodynamic velocity equation for
stationary incompressible ﬂow. The stress Tensor R is, in general, a nonlinear
functional of u. Grabert, in [4], sec. 8.5, performs an approximation to the ﬁrst
order of ∇u and obtains exactly the Stokes form of the tensor. Therefore, in
this approximation, (2.20) is the stationary Navier-Stokes equation.

By (2.18), u is essentially equal to the expectation of the momentum density.
By deﬁnition from probability theory, the expectation ist an average built from
a set of realisations of the process, which can be interpreted as repetitions of the
experiment und identical external conditions. If the ﬂow exhibits macroscopic,
i. e.
turbulent, ﬂuctuations, the averaging process includes these. There is
barely another possibility than, in this case, to interpret u as the mean velocity
of the ﬂow. On the other hand, if one wants to deﬁne the ’point’ velocity of
turbulent ﬂow, it would be necessary to introduce a conditional expectation,
which excludes the macroscopic ﬂuctuations, with respect of which the mean
quantity would still be a random variable. - The preceding statement is quite
general; it is still valid if one performs a projection operator analyses. Thus, in
case of stationary turbulent ﬂow (2.20) is the mean velocity equation. It is of
course necessary to check this theoretical statement by bringing the equation
into a form that can be evaluated, and comparing the results with a turbulent
ﬂow experiment.

The diﬀerence is that for turbulent ﬂow the nonlinear part of the stress
tensor R is essential. The deﬁnition formula for the stress tensor kernel function
S (2.22) contains a time correlation function in local equilibrium. This is a
quantity which, for processes with constant mass density and temperature, is a
functional of the velocity ﬁeld. It has to be evaluated in advance, by a separate
statistical-mechanical formalism. At present there is no theoretical means to
perform this; instead, it is possible to calculate correlation functions for total
equilibrium. It should be emphasized that, since total equilibrium corresponds
to macroscopic rest, the latter quantities do not depend on the ﬂow properties;
they are material ’constants’ of the ﬂuid. - In order to pursue the analysis, S has
been expanded into a functional power series in u; as will be seen, the coeﬃcients
of the series contain total equilibrium correlations. It will be necessary then to
evaluate the lowest order terms of the expansion and to work with formulas
(2.20), (2.21) with an approximated quantity S. When the formlism is applied
to a given ﬂow conﬁguration, it is possible to render all variable quantities in the
expansion dimension-free, which causes certain constant factors to appear in the
terms of it. The author elaborates on an application to circular jet ﬂow; where
these factors show up actually as increasing powers of the Reynolds number Re.
Thus, it is seen that in this case the application should be restricted to low
Reynolds number ﬂow, just beyond the laminar-turbulent transition.

S depends on u via the quantities b (2.8b) in the formula for the local equilib-
rium distribution. The series expansion of S is performed by expanding it with
respect to the b at the point b = b0 which corresponds to u =0:

b0 = {−βµ , β , 0}

b − b0 = {β

u2 , 0 , −βu }

(3.1)

(3.2)

Replacing b by b0 changes the local equilibrium distribution (2.8a) into the
total equilibrium distribution (2.7a) with the prescribed mass density and tem-
perature. The power expansion of S reads:

S = S|b0 +

|b0 ∗ (b − b0) +

2!

δ2S
δb δb

|b0 ∗ ∗{(b − b0), (b − b0)} + · · ·
= S(0) + S(1) + S(2) + · · ·

(3.3)

In the second row, symbols are applied to the diﬀerent orders of the expan-
sion. The expansion in u is obtained from (3.3) by restricting the summation
inherent in the ∗-operation to the last element of b − b0 in (3.2). It is seen there
that the ﬁrst element also depends on u. But for the present investigation,
where no sound or heat conduction processes are considered, the expansion co-
eﬃcients come out to be non-zero only for ’Latin’ values of the indices; thus the
ﬁrst element of b does not contribute.

The linear part of R which results from the constant term S(0) of the ex-
pansion (3.3) leads to the Stokes form of the stress tensor, which coincides with
the result of Grabert. At present, the 2nd and 3rd order terms of R have been
analyzed. From (2.21) it can be seen that these stem from the parts S(1) and
S(2) of the S-series, respectively. To obtain these formulas, it is necessary to
calculate the ﬁrst and second order functional derivatives of S. The ﬁrst of
these has been done in Piest [6]. For completeness, the derivation is repeated
in the appendix. The result is formula (a.17); by setting b = b0 one obtains:

P0 is the total equilibrium projection operator:

P0g = hgi0 + hg δ0ai0 ∗ hδ0a δ0ai−1

0 ∗ δ0a

(3.5)

Here, δ0g = g − hgi0, and we have hpi0 = 0.- The total equilibrium triple
correlation function contained in (3.4) can be calculated using the mode coupling
technique in the form of Martin et al.
[8], which is a systematic version of
the method of Kawasaki [9], and has been complemented by Deker and Haake

7

[10]. The formulas have been evaluated by the author, and applied using the
experimental data of the circular jet (Piest [7]). One obtains the solution again
in form of a power series. The expansion parameter χ reads:

χ =

1
βν2ρx

(3.6)

ν is the kinematic viscosity, x the distance of the observation point from
the oriﬁce. With a typical value x = 0.3 [m], for a laboratory experiment in
air, one obtains χ = 5.8 · 10−11, which is so small that practically only the zero
order term of the expansion counts.- It was rather surprising that for the linear
term of the u-series of S (3.3), a zeroth order χ-Term is found which leads to a
second order term of the friction force D = ∇ · R:

D(2,0) = ρ(u · ∇u)−

∇(u · u)

(3.7)

λ
2

λ = α/(γcV ) is a physical parameter of the ﬂuid, α being the thermal ex-
pansion coeﬃcient, γ the isothermal compressibility, and cV the speciﬁc heat for
constant volume. The apparent existence of this term poses a problem to the
intepretation of equation (2.20). It should be noticed that, since for suﬃcient
low Reynolds number the ﬂow is laminar, there are no macroscopic ﬂuctuations
then, and u equals the classical hydrodynamic ’point’ velocity. Therefore, for
decreasing Re, equation (2.20) should reduce to the stationary Navier-Stokes
equation. On the other hand, D(2,0) is of equal power in Re as the quadratic
term on the left of (2.20) so that, even for small Re, (2.20) remains diﬀerent.
Since this is not possible, something must be wrong with the prerequisites of
the derivation of (3.7). As a preliminary measure, it is assumed that the term
actually does not exist. It is of course one of the most urging requirements for
this approach to suﬃciently explain this defect.

The third order term of the expansion of R contains, after (2.21) and (3.3),
the second-order derivative, which is presented in (a.35). When this formula is
applied to b = b0 as in (3.4), the summation in the corresponding term in (3.3)
is restricted to the last term of (3.2) and the result is inserted into (2.21), on
obtains for the friction force D = ∇ · R:

For formal reasons, all ∇-operations have been transferred to the correlation
function, partly by partial integration. Formulas (3.8), (3.9) are the main result
of the present paper. The deﬁnition formula for the kernel function K contains

a time integral over a correlation function which is double in time but quadruple
in space. To calculate it, the author has again applied the technique described
in Martin et al. [8], Deker and Haake [10]; it had to be enlarged slightly so that
quadruple correlations could be determined. This investigation will be presented
in a separate paper. The resulting formula is rather lenghty and will not be given
here. It should be emphasized that with K obtained as an explicit formula of
the four space variables, (2.20), (3.8) form a closed system for calculating the
velocity ﬁeld for a given ﬂow conﬁguration. Moreover, since this formula is the
lowest order term of the expansion (see the comment to (3.7)), (2.20), (3.8) is
the simplest form of the system for checking, by comparing with experimental
results, whether the approach works. As has been mentioned, a numerical test
using the data for the circular jet is in progress.

4 Summary

An approach to arrive at the mean velocity equation for turbulent ﬂuid ﬂow has
been attempted with the aid of the projection operator technique in classical
Statistical Mechanics. The hydrodynamic velocity is deﬁned in this technique
via the conjugate thermodynamic ﬁelds in the formula for the relevant proba-
bility density; multiplied by the mass density, it is identical to the expectation
of the microscopic momentum density. It is argued that in situations where the
ﬂuid ﬂow is turbulent, this is precisely the mean velocity ﬁeld of the ﬂow. If
this argument is correct, the momentum component of the generalized transport
equation derived by this technique is the mean velocity equation.

Stationary incompressible ﬂow for constant mass density and temperature
is considered. The formula for the stress tensor is a nonlinear functional of
the velocity, the linear part of which has the form of the Stokes tensor. The
formula containes a local equilibrium time correlation function. At present,
there exists a theory for calculating correlation functions for total equilibrium
only. As a preliminary measure, the stress tensor has been developed into a
power series in the velocity, though this limits the applicability of the equation
to low Reynolds number ﬂow. The coeﬃcients of the expansion contain total
equilibrium correlations which can be calculated. The second order term has
been evaluated in a former paper of the author. For completeness, the main
results have been reported here. The calculation leads to a second order friction
term which is comparable in form to the convolution term of the equation. This
constitutes a problem to the present approach since from general knowledge
about the Reynolds equation such a term cannot appear.

For the third order term, the form of the kernel function has been calculated.
The formula has been evaluated with the aid of the mode coupling theory of
Statistical Mechanics; the results will be reported in a separate paper. A nu-
merical calculation in order to test the equation with the experimental data for
the circular jet is under way.

We have to evaluate the limit expression. We will assume here that in the
limit of large times, the factors of a time correlation will become statistically
independent so that for stationary processes we have:

b

b

h[e(1−P)iLt A]BiL = hAiLhBiL

(a.12)

For any phase space function g, let us deﬁne a quantity F (t′):

F (t′) = lim

The evaluation results in:

(a.14)

The ﬁrst step is the evaluation of P using (2.10); next, we use (a.12); ﬁnally,
the factor outside the curled brackets vanishes, since we have, for any phase
space function g:

h(1 − P)giL = 0

(a.15)

Therefore, in (a.11), the limit term vanishes, and we have:

to a certain extent that of the ﬁrst order. The right hand side of (a.17) depends
on b at ﬁve diﬀerent places; thus we write:

The ﬁrst step is by direct calculation. To the terms, we apply (a.9), (a.4)
respectively, to obtain the second step. Comparing this with (a.13), we ﬁnd that
the ﬁrst term on the right of (a.33) is F (t′) applied to g = δa, and is therefore
zero. Thus, we have shown that actually (a.26) vanishes. In total, we obtain
from (a.18), together with (a.19), (a.23), (a.24):

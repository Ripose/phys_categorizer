In nonrelativistic approximation one-dimensional motion of Sommerfeld sphere

in the case of potential barrier is numerically investigated. The eﬀect of classi-
cal tunneling is conﬁrmed once more - Sommerfeld sphere overcomes the barrier
and ﬁnds itself in the forbidden, from classical point of view, area

The problem of radiation reaction in classical electrodynamics is still dis-
cussed in the literature (for ex. see [1]). This problem can be formulated in the
following way: it is known that classical charged body moving with acceleration
must radiate. Thus there is back reaction of outgoing electromagnetic waves.
But what quantity feels this back reaction - pure mechanical mass of a charged
body or an eﬀective mass, constructed from the mechanical mass and energy of
self electromagnetic ﬁeld? Is this eﬀective mass constant on the trajectory of a
moving body or a function of time? In another words, what is the dynamics of
a charged body due to radiation reaction?

To answer these questions long time ago [2] was proposed by Sommerfeld
model of sphere with uniform surface charge Q and mechanical mass m.
In
nonrelativistic approximation such sphere obeys the equation (see also [3,4,5,6]):

m ˙~v = ~Fext + η [~v(t − 2a/c) − ~v(t)]

One can ﬁnd in the literature the opinion [1], that the equation (1) has no
unphysical solutions and ”free of the problems that have plagued the theory for
most of this century”.

But the fact is that (as was shown in [7]) equation of motion for Sommerfeld
model possesses some strange solution which can be interpreted as ”classical
tunneling” (see also [8,9] ). The physics of this eﬀect is simple: due to retarda-

tion the body ”understands” that there is the potential barrier ”too late” and
thus can fall through the barrier.

Here we consider one-dimensional motion of the shell in more simple, then in
[7], case - in nonrelativistic case for potential barrier, produced by homogeneous
static electric ﬁeld Ez, stretched in z - direction for 0 < z < L (like in plane

It is useful to compare solutions of (1) with classical point charge motion
in the same ﬁeld, governed by the following nonrelativistic equation without
radiation force:

A. Dividing x-axis into unit intervals, one can ﬁnd solutions of (2) on each
interval in elementary functions (exponents) and then sew them together with
appropriate boundary conditions (position of the center of the shell and its
velocity must be continuous) thus constructing the solution of (2) on the whole

through numerical calculations.

Numerical calculations of eq. (2) show that there is the eﬀect of classical

tunneling for Sommerfeld sphere.

Indeed, classical point particle motion, governed by eq. (3), is simple:

here dy

dx = v, v0 - initial velocity.

Thus for given initial velocity for 2|λ| > v2

0 there is the turning point - i.e.

classical particle cannot overcome the potential barrier.
But for Sommerfeld sphere the result is diﬀerent.
Numerical results are on ﬁg. (A.1-A.3) (vertical axis is velocity dy/dx, hor-

izontal axis is coordinate y, −1/2 < y < 3/2 - i.e. inside the barrier).

On ﬁg. A.1 we can see the eﬀect of tunneling for the following values of k

and λ:

k = 1, λ = −0.5.
Velocities of the shell are
v = 0.4,

v = 0.6,

and λ:

v = 0.7 (- all give rebounce);

v = 0.8 (and here is

and all of them are from the ”forbidden area” v ≤
On ﬁg. A.2 we can see the eﬀect of tunneling for the following values of k

2|λ| = 1.0.

k = 1, λ = −0.1.
Velocities of the shell are:
v = 0.12, v = 0.3 (rebounce);
and all of them are from the ”forbidden area” v ≤
Comparing ﬁg. A.3 with ﬁg. A.2, we can see that the more greater
the value of k (”more” retardation), the more stronger becomes the eﬀect of
tunneling:

v = 0.4 (tunneling)

2|λ| = 0.4472....

p

on ﬁg. A.3: k = 10, λ = −0.1;
velocities of the shell are the same as for ﬁg. A.2:
v = 0.12 (rebounce); v = 0.3, v = 0.4 (tunneling)
Thus we see that the eﬀect of classical tunneling exists not only for point-
like particles, governed by Lorentz-Dirac equation [8], but also exists for charged
bodies of ﬁnite size.

Abstract

We study the stability of the circular orbits of the electromagnetic two-body problem in a

generalized electromagnetic setting that includes retarded and advanced interactions. We give a

method to derive the equations of tangent dynamics about circular orbits up to nonlinear terms

and we derive the linearized equations explicitly. In particular we study the normal modes of the

linearized dynamics that have an arbitrarily large imaginary eigenvalue. These large imaginary

eigenvalues deﬁne fast frequencies that introduce a fast (stiﬀ) timescale into the dynamics. As

an application to Dirac’s electrodynamics of point charges with retarded-only interactions, we

study the conditions for the dynamics to perform fast spinning motions of small amplitude about

a circular orbit. The balancing of the fast timescale is described by a multiscale solution that

requires a resonance. The resonant orbits have angular momenta that turn out to be integer

multiples of Planck’s constant to a good approximation. Among the many qualitative agreements

with quantum electrodynamics (QED), the orbital frequency of the resonant orbits are given by a

diﬀerence of two eigenvalues of a linear operator. The principal result is that the emission lines of

QED agree with the prediction of our resonance condition within a few percent average deviation.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we experiment with the stability analysis of the circular orbits of the electro-

magnetic two-body problem, a dynamical system with implicitly-deﬁned delay. The motiva-

tion is to understand the balancing of the fast dynamics described by the delay equations for

particle separations of the order of the atomic magnitude. We give an economical method to

derive the linearized equations of motion about the circular orbits. The balancing of the fast

dynamics generates a new type of orbit, one involving a fast spinning toroidal motion about

the circular orbit. We work in a generalized electromagnetic setting where the ﬁeld of the

point charge is a linear combination of the advanced and the retarded Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁelds

with an arbitrary coeﬃcient [1], henceforth called the Eliezer setting (ES) (see Appendix

A). We study in detail a speciﬁc feature of the tangent dynamics; The stiﬀ normal modes of

the linearized dynamics, that have an arbitrarily large imaginary eigenvalue and introduce a

fast timescale in the dynamics. The derivation of the fast normal modes of tangent dynam-

ics is our main technical contribution to the understanding of this dynamical system. For

some special cases of the ES we ﬁnd a remarkable quasi-degeneracy of the tangent dynamics;

these cases are Dirac’s theory with retarded-only ﬁelds, the action-at-a-distance electrody-

namics and the dissipative Fokker theory of Ref.

[2] (see Appendix B). Last, we discuss

the surprising predictions of stability analysis for the balancing of the fast dynamics of the

hydrogen atom in Dirac’s theory. Our multiscale description of the dynamics necessitates a

resonance condition that is satisﬁed precisely in the atomic magnitude. We predict several

features of the hydrogen atom of quantum electrodynamics (QED) [3] with good precision

and qualitative detail. The frequencies of the resonant orbits agree with the lines of QED

within a few percent average deviation. There is also a large body of qualitative agreement

with QED; (i) the emitted frequency is given by a diﬀerence of two linear eigenvalues (the

Rydberg-Ritz principle) (ii) the resonant orbits have angular momenta that are approximate

multiples of a basic angular momentum. This basic angular momentum of the ES agrees

well with Planck’s constant and (iii) the angular momentum of the fast spinning dynamics

is of the order of the lowest orbital angular momentum.

Dirac’s 1938 work [1] on the electrodynamics of point charges gave complex delay equa-

tions that were seldom studied. Eliezer generalized Dirac’s method of covariant subtrac-

tion of inﬁnities in 1947[4] to include advanced interactions naturally (the ES), providing

2

a testbed for studies in electrodynamics of point charges [4]. Among the few dynamics of

point charges investigated, another early result of Eliezer [5–8] revealed a surprising result

(henceforth called Eliezer’s theorem); An electron moving in the Coulomb ﬁeld of an in-

ﬁnitely massive proton can never fall into the proton by radiating energy. The result was

generalized to motions in arbitrary attractive potentials [6], as well as to tridimensional

motions with self-interaction in a Coulomb ﬁeld [7, 8], ﬁnding that only scattering states

are possible. Since our model has the dynamics of Eliezer’s theorem as the inﬁnite-mass

limit, a ﬁnite mass for the proton is essential for a physically meaningful dynamics; If the

proton has a ﬁnite mass, there is no inertial frame where it rests at all times, and this in

turn causes delay because of the ﬁnite speed of light. A ﬁnite mass for the proton is what

brings delay into the electromagnetic two-body dynamics, with its associated fast dynamics.

This inﬁnite-mass limit is a singular limit, because the equations of motion pass from delay

equations to ordinary diﬀerential equations! Our understanding of this two-body dynamics

might prove useful for atomic physics and perhaps we can understand QED as the eﬀective

theory of this complex stiﬀ dynamics with delay. We shall describe the two-body motion

in terms of the familiar center-of-mass coordinates and coordinates of relative separation,

deﬁned as the familiar coordinate-transformation that maps the two-body Kepler problem

onto the one-body problem with a reduced mass plus a free-moving center of mass. We

stress that in the present relativistic motion the Cartesian center-of-mass vector is not ig-

norable, and it represents three extra coupled degrees-of-freedom. We introduce the concept

of resonant dissipation to exploit this coupling and the many solutions that a delay equation

can have. Resonant dissipation is the condition that both particles decelerate together, i.e.,

the center-of-mass vector decelerates, while the coordinates of relative separation perform an

almost-circular orbit, despite of the energy losses of the metastable center-of-mass dynamics.

The road map for this paper is as follows; In Section IV we give the main technical part of

the paper; We outline our economical method to derive the tangent dynamics of the circular

orbit by expanding the implicit light-cone condition and the action to quadratic order. In

this Section we also take the stiﬀ limit of the linear modes of the tangent dynamics.

In

Section V we give an application to atomic physics, by discussing a necessary condition

for the state of resonant dissipation; This condition is expressed by a resonance condition

that predicts the correct atomic scales. The earlier sections are a prelude to Section IV.

In Appendix A we give the equations of motion for the electrodynamics of point charges in

3

the ES. Section II is a review of the circular orbit solution, to be used in Section IV and in

Section V. In Section III we give an action formalism for the Li´enard-Wiechert sector of the

ES as a prelude to the quadratic expansions needed for the linear stability analysis of Section

IV. In Appendix B we derive the general tangent dynamics for oscillations perpendicular to

the orbital plane. The Lemma of resonant dissipation of Appendix C proves that for the

linearized equations of motion the state of resonant dissipation is impossible, showing that

a resonance is needed. Still in Appendix C we discuss how the nonlinear stiﬀ terms balance

the leading dissipative term of the self-interaction force and we estimate the radius of the

stiﬀ torus. Last, in Section VI we put the conclusions and discussion.

II. THE CIRCULAR ORBIT SOLUTION

The circular-orbit solution of the isolated electromagnetic two-body problem of the action-

at-a-distance electrodynamics (the ES with k =

1/2, see Appendix A) is used here as the

unperturbed orbit[9, 10]. For the ES with k =

1/2, the tangent dynamics of the next

section is straightforward Lyapunov stability analysis. In the general case, ( k

=

1/2), the

−

ES also prescribes a small force opposite to the velocity of each particle along the circular

−

−

orbit, such that the circular orbit is not an exact solution of the equations of motion. The

tangent dynamics is then the starting point of a perturbation scheme to obtain a stiﬀ torus

near a circular orbit (the state of resonant dissipation discussed in Appendix C).

We shall use the index i = 1 for the electron and i = 2 for the proton, with masses m1 and
e2 ≡ −
1
−
(the electronic charge). The circular orbit is illustrated in Fig. 1; the two particles move in

m2 respectively. We henceforth use units where the speed of light is c = 1 and e1 =

concentric circles with the same constant angular speed and along a diameter. The details

of

this relativistic orbit will be given now; The constant angular velocity is indicated by

Ω , the distance between the particles in light-cone is rb and θ

Ωrb is the angle that one

≡

particle turns while the light emanating from the other particle reaches it (the light-cone

time lag). The angle θ is the natural independent parameter of this relativistic problem. For

orbits of the atomic magnitude the orbital frequency is given to leading order by Kepler’s

law

of Ref.
b2 = m1/(m1 + m2) plus a correction of order θ2. As discussed in Ref.

III. AN ACTION FOR THE LORENTZ FORCE

We introduce an action to be used as an economical means to derive the Lorentz-force

sector of the ES equations of motion with the linear combination of retarded and advanced

Li´enard-Wiechert potentials. In the following we derive the tangent dynamics by expanding

this action to quadratic order. We henceforth use the dot to indicate the scalar product of

5

two Cartesian vectors. The Li´enard-Wiechert action for the Lorentz-force sector of the ES

In Eq. (7) v1 stands for the Cartesian velocity of particle 1 at time t1 and v2a and v2b

respectively. The vector n12a is a unit vector connecting the advanced position of particle 2

at time t2 to the position of particle 1 at time t1, vector n12b is a unit vector connecting the

retarded position of particle 2 at time t2 to the position of particle 1 at time t1 and (Below

Eq. (8) of Ref. [2] this normal is deﬁned to the opposite direction, but it was used correctly

in Eq. (19) of Ref. [2] ). Notice that each integral on the right-hand-side of Eq. (7) can be

where V and A are the Li´enard-Wiechert scalar potential and the Li´enard-Wiechert vector

(8) such that c = 1 represents the advanced interaction while c =

1 in the denominator of Eq.

1 represents the retarded

−

interaction. The quantities of particle 2 in Eq. (8) are to be evaluated at the time t2 deﬁned

implicitly by

±

t2 = t1 +

r12
c

,

where c =

1 describes the advanced and the retarded light cones, respectively. Because of

this decomposition into V and A parts, we henceforth call Eq. (8) the VA interaction. The

minimization of action (7) plus the kinetic energy of particle 1 yields the equations of motion

for particle 1 suﬀering the Lorentz-force of the Li´enard-Wiechert potentials produced by the

other particle (see Eq. (55) ), as shown for example in Ref.[11]).

Besides the Lorentz-force, which is the Lagrangian part of the ES equations of motion,

there is also the dissipative self-interaction force in Eq. (55). The shortest way to write the

ES equations of tangent dynamics is to add this term to the Lagrangian equations of motion,

watching carefully for the correct multiplicative factor. The stiﬀ limit is determined by the

largest-order derivative appearing in the linearized equations of motion of Appendix A. In

this approximation, the contribution of the self-interaction force of the ES to the linearized

6

dynamics about a circular orbit is simply given by the Abraham-Lorentz -Dirac force

with a renormalized charge. The contribution of the other smaller nonlinear terms will be

given elsewhere (one such nonlinear term is used in the estimate of Appendix C).

IV. EXPANDING THE ACTION TO FIRST ORDER: MINIMIZATION

In the following sections we substitute the circular orbit of Eqs. (3) and (4) plus a planar

perturbation into Eliezer’s action (7). We then expand the action up to the quadratic order

to yield the linearized equations of motion. Our economical derivation of the stability

equations anticipates the need to study the stability of the stiﬀ torus near the circular orbit,

a novel solution of the two-body problem as illustrated in Fig 2. In this work we keep to the

linear stability of circular orbits, which is done with the quadratic expansion of the action.

The variational equations for planar perturbations are decoupled from the equation for

transverse perturbations. We perform the planar stability analysis using complex gyroscopic

coordinates rotating at the frequency Ω of the unperturbed circular orbit; The coordinates

(xj, yj) of each particle are deﬁned by two complex numbers ηj and ξj ( j = 1 for electron

and j = 2 for proton) according to

gyroscopic η and ξ coordinates. The d’s are real numbers if we choose the origin of times at

t = 0, but we have kept the harmless star above them to indicate complex conjugation in

anticipation to what follows. Two quantities appear so often in the calculations that we have

named them; (i) The numerator of the action (8) along circular orbits, henceforth called C,

again for either retarded or advanced interactions (c =
1). For the stiﬀ limit of Sections
V and VI we shall ignore the O(θ2) corrections and set C = S = 1. Here we shall derive

±

the electron’s equation of motion only (j = 1 in Eq. (11)). The equation for the proton

is completely symmetric and can be obtained by interchanging the indices. One can derive

from Eq. (11) that the electron’s velocity at time t1 is

The velocity of the proton at its time t2 can be obtained by simple interchange of the indices

1 and 2, remembering that d1 = b1 is deﬁned positive while d2 =

b2 is deﬁned negative,

−

because at the same time the particles are in diametrically opposed positions on the exact
circular orbit, such that the exchange operation on the d′s is d1 ⇐⇒ −

d2 (see Fig. 1).

The coordinates of particle 2 entering in the VA interaction of Eq. (8) are evaluated at

a time t2 in light-cone with the the present of particle 1. Because the implicit light-cone

condition has to be expanded and solved by iteration, it is convenient to deﬁne a function

ϕc as

t2 ≡

The above deﬁnition is good for both the advanced and the retarded cases, c = 1 deﬁning

the advanced light-cone and c =

1 deﬁning the retarded light-cone and the underscore c

is to indicate that ϕc is a function of c. If the perturbation is zero then ϕc = 0 and we are

along the original circular orbit, where the light-cone lag is the constant rb. We henceforth

call t the present time of particle 1 (the electron) and we measure the evolution in terms of

the scaled-time parameter τ

Ωt. The implicit deﬁnition of ϕc by the light-cone condition

involves the position of particle 2 at the advanced and the retarded time t2 as deﬁned by

The linear stability analysis involves expanding the equation of motion to ﬁrst order in ηk

and ξk , which in turn is determined by the quadratic expansion of the action (7) in ηk and

ξk. We must therefore carry all expansions up to the second order in the ηξ coordinates. For

example the position vector of particle 2 can be determined to second order by expanding

the arguments of η and ξ in a Taylor series about the value on the unperturbed circular

light-cone for one order only as

stability analysis of the circular orbit. We shall always expand quantities evaluated at the

perturbed light-cone in a Taylor series about the unperturbed light-cone up to the order

needed, such that our method yields equations with a ﬁxed delay. The perturbed light-cone

is expressed implicitly by the distance from the advanced/retarded position of particle 2 to

the present position of particle 1, described in gyroscopic coordinates by the modulus of the

complex number

where c = 1 describes the advanced position and c =

Notice that the star appears in the unusual ﬁrst line because we are factoring Ωt2 out in Eq.

has a unitary modulus. The last term on the right-hand side of Eq. (20) is a quadratic form

times exp(iΩt2) and in the action it only appears multiplied by a counter-rotating constant

term, i.e., a quadratic form times exp(

iΩt2), such that the product is independent of

−

t2. Therefore this quadratic term can be integrated by parts and the Gauge term can be

disregarded, as in any Lagrangian. We henceforth call this a quadratic Gauge simpliﬁcation

and we shall use it in several expressions. This simpliﬁcation applied to integrate the terms

equations of tangent dynamics.

Notice that in Eq. (38) the coordinates of particle 2 appear evaluated in either the retarded

or the advanced unperturbed light-cone, which is indicated by the subindex c. The full

quadratic expansion of the action is composed of the kinetic energy plus the partial actions

of Eq. (38) evaluated at the retarded and the advanced light-cones and multiplied by the

respective Eliezer’s coeﬃcient, as in Eq. (7)

L1 = T1 −

Notice in Eq. (38) the appearance of the angular-momentum-like binaries inside parenthesis,

a normalization achieved by adding a quadratic Gauge term to the Taylor series. The

coeﬃcient of each normal-form binary is obtained by a simple Gauge-invariant combination

of derivatives, for example the magnetic ﬁeld coeﬃcient B is given by

Minimization of action (39) respect to η1, ξ2 and η2 yields three more linear equations,

which together with Eq. (41) compose a system of four linear delay equations. This system

of equations can be solved in general by Laplace transform [15]. Here we shall concentrate

on the separable normal mode solutions of this linear system. For that we substitute ξ1 =

A exp(λτ /θ), η1 = B exp(λτ /θ), ξ2 = C exp(λτ /θ) and η2 = D exp(λτ /θ) into the linearized

VI. STIFF TORUS AS A DEFORMED CIRCULAR ORBIT

is a remarkable quasi-degeneracy of the perpendicular and the planar tangent dynamics for

some special settings. Here we shall focus on Dirac’s electrodynamics with retarded-only

negative, such that the tangent dynamics about the circular orbit is stable in the stiﬀ-limit.
The coeﬃcient of the term of order 1/λ2 is the main diﬀerence between Eqs. (75) and (43).
The terms of order θ4λ2 also diﬀer but they are much less important for θ in the atomic

range. The exact roots of Eqs. (75) and (43) are deﬁned by

where ǫ1(θ) and ǫ2(θ) are real numbers of the order of θ and depending on the orbit through

θ. The stiﬀ torus is formed from an initial circular orbit as follows; (i) the oﬀending force

against the velocity dissipates energy and makes the electron loose radius on a slow timescale

(the usual radiative instability discussed in Appendix C), and (ii) when the electron deviates

enough from the circular orbit, the stiﬀ nonlinear terms compensate the oﬀending terms

15

and balance the real parts of Eq. (46), the σ′s . In this way a purely harmonic solution

to the nonlinear equations of tangent dynamics appears; the nonlinear stiﬀ terms introduce

a correction proportional to the radius a of the stiﬀ torus divided by θ in Eqs. (43) and

(75). The complete description of this new solution involves expanding the action about the

circular orbit to the fourth order and shall be given elsewhere. Because of the large frequency

of the stiﬀ motion, this balancing is established at a very small radius, as estimated by Eq.

(82) of Appendix C. The motion continues to be stiﬀ because of the imaginary part of the

′

λ

s of Eq. (46). In the following we outline a multiscale expansion about the balanced stiﬀ

torus to derive a resonance condition between the modes of tangent dynamics. As discussed

in Appendix C, the circular orbit recoils in a slow timescale to compensate the momentum

loss to the radiated energy. During the slow recoil the particle coordinates are described by

a composition of a translation mode and a stiﬀ mode with a slowly varying amplitude

ξk = Ak(T ) + uk(T ) exp[(πqi + iǫa

1)Ωt/θ],

Zk = Bk(T ) + Rk(T ) exp[(πqi + iǫa

2)Ωt/θ],

where the amplitudes uk and Rk must be near the size where the nonlinearity balances

the negative real part of the linear modes. Assuming that the amplitudes uk and Rk have a

typical size a, as given by Eq. (82), the angular momentum along the orbital plane calculated

from (47) is

where on the second line of Eq. (48) we have used formula (1) for Ω and formula (2) for

oscillation in Eq. (48). As illustrated in Fig. 2, the fast spinning angular momentum should

rotate with the circular orbit at the frequency Ω, such that its phase should be equal to Ωt.

This phase velocity condition imposed on Eq. (48) yields the following resonance condition

In Ref.

[2] we had postulated heuristically a

[2] were also in the atomic scale and had

the same qualitative behavior found here, which seems to be a generic feature of these stiﬀ

electromagnetic resonances of the two-body problem. In the last paragraph of Appendix C

we derive this same resonance condition (49) from the solvability of a multiscale asymptotic

solution. The above-deﬁned root-searching problem of Eq. (52) is well posed and for each

integer q it turns out that one can ﬁnd a pair of the form (46) if one sacriﬁces θ in Eqs. (75)

and (43), i.e., θ must be quantized! According to QED, circular Bohr orbits have maximal

angular momenta and a radiative selection rule ( ∆l =

Table 1 illustrates the fact that a resonance involving the tangent dynamics of a circular

we had to jump the integer q by twenty units for a complete quantitative and qualitative

agreement with the Bohr atom. The qualitative agreement achieved by Table 1 is superior

in this way; only for the ﬁrst two values of q things are not completely natural, and we had
to jump some q′s , after that q increases one by one in qualitative agreement with QED.

It remains to be seen if using the correct b given by the expansion about the stiﬀ torus

will change things quantitatively. The calculation of b necessitates expanding the action to

fourth order and shall de done elsewhere.

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

In the limit where the proton has an inﬁnite mass, the concept of resonant dissipation

looses meaning because the center-of-mass coordinate no longer plays a dynamical role. In

this singular limit, there is a Lorentz frame where the proton rests at the origin at all times,

and the ﬁeld at the electron reduces to a simple Coulomb ﬁeld in the ES. The two-body dy-

namics in the ES reduces then to the dynamical system of Eliezer’s theorem; self-interaction

plus a Coulomb ﬁeld acting on the electron [5, 6]. We repeat this correct dynamics because

it is very unpopular [5–8]; With inclusion of self-interaction, it is impossible for the electron

to ”spiral into the proton”. Neither bound states nor dives are possible, only scattering

states exist. One accomplishment of the present work is to recognize that only the two-body

problem can produce a physically sensible electromagnetic-like model. By expanding the

dynamics about a quasi-planetary orbit (the circular orbit), we saw in Appendix C the need

for a novel ingredient of the electromagnetic two-body dynamics; the stiﬀ spinning motions!

Another qualitative dynamical picture is suggested by Eliezer’s result [5, 6]; The dynam-

ical phenomenon that the electron always turns away from the proton along unidimensional

orbits suggests that colinear orbits are the natural attractors of the dissipative dynamics

(the ground state of the hydrogen atom, with zero angular momentum!). Along such orbits,

the heavy particle (the proton) moves in a non-Coulombian way and the self-interaction

provides the repulsive mechanism that avoids the collision at the origin. This is again in

agreement with the Schroedinger theory, where the ground state has a zero angular mo-

mentum. Again, the inﬁnite-mass case produces unphysical dynamics; the electron turns

away from the proton but then it runs away [6]. It remains to be researched if the two-body

case has a physical orbit for zero-angular momentum orbits if one includes the delay and its

associated fast dynamics.

In the dynamical process of resonant dissipation, the sharp line is emitted while the

dynamics is locked to the neighborhood of the resonant orbit. This long timescale is to be

compared to the time of spontaneous decay prescribed by QED for the circular hydrogen
lines; about 106 orbital turns or 10−9 seconds. This is indeed a very long timescale compared

to the orbital period. On the other hand, the stiﬀ modes of Eq. (46) have a frequency of

about πq/θ

1000 times the orbital frequency. The fast frequency of 1018 Hertz would

≃

resonate with the X-ray frequencies used in the Compton eﬀect [18] and it also sets the

19

timescale for a stiﬀ jump of the dynamics; 10−18 seconds (1 attosecond). The dynamics

starting from an asymptotic resonant orbit to another of a neighboring q should be described

by a stiﬀ jump, as expected generically from any stiﬀ equation. In Ref [19], the much simpler

Van der Pol oscillator is worked out in detail as an example of an equation of Lienard

type that exhibits stiﬀ jumps.

In quantum mechanics it is popular to use the concept

of a quantum jump to describe the stiﬀ passage from one quantum state to another. It

appears that classical electrodynamics prescribes exactly this qualitative phenomenon; a

quasi-instantaneous fast dynamics that could be predicted theoretically and compared to

experiment.

The two-body dynamics in the ES solves several conundrums of the hydrogen atom.

Most of those conundrums were created by imagining that the equations of electrodynamics

would accept solutions isomorphic to planetary orbits. We have seen that the stiﬀ spinning

is necessary in the neighborhood of quasi-planetary orbits, as proved by our Lemma of

resonant dissipation of Appendix C. The stiﬀ spinning is a novel and non-planetary feature.

The qualitative agreements with QED are listed in the following; (i) the resonant orbits are

naturally quantized by integers and the radiated frequencies agree with the Bohr circular

lines within a few percent average deviation. (ii) the angular momenta of the resonant orbits

are naturally quantized with the correct Planck’s constant. (iii) the stability analysis uses

a linear dynamical system with delay, a dynamical system that needs an initial function

as the initial condition, just like Schroedinger’s equation.

It remains to be seen if this

linear operator is self-adjoint, like in Schroedinger’s equation, (iv) The emitted frequencies

are given by a diﬀerence of two eigenvalues of this linear operator, like the Rydberg-Ritz

combinatorial principle of quantum physics, (v) the spin angular momentum of the fast

toroidal motion is of the order of the lowest orbital angular momentum. In QED the electron
has a spin angular momentum of √3~/2 . The calculation of the spin angular momentum

for the balanced stiﬀ dynamics involves the phases of the fast oscillations as well as the

detailed consideration of all stiﬀ terms and is beyond the estimates of the present work.

We exhibited a new solution of two-body motion in the electrodynamics of point charges.

The fast stiﬀ dynamics is an ingredient that appears naturally in the equations of motion and

it has been so far largely overlooked. The balancing of the fast dynamics leads naturally to

fast spinning motions; the multiscale analysis imposes resonances, and these turn out to be

satisﬁed precisely in the atomic magnitude! The large body of qualitative and quantitative

20

agreement with QED suggests that further extensive studies of this two-body dynamics [4]

could oﬀer an explanation of QED in terms of a stiﬀ dynamical system with third derivatives

and delay.

IX. APPENDIX A: ELIEZER’S ELECTRODYNAMICS OF POINT CHARGES

In Eliezer’s generalized electrodynamics[4], the ﬁeld produced by the point charge is

supposed to be the retarded ﬁeld plus a free ﬁeld G

The free ﬁeld G should satisfy Maxwell’s equations, be ﬁnite along the particle’s worldline

and vanish if the particle is at rest. The choice of Eliezer in [4] is

µ = F ν

where k is a fundamental parameter of nature related to the covariant limit producing the

point charge [4]. This generalized electromagnetic setting is henceforth called the Eliezer

setting (ES). Analogously to Dirac’s theory [1], Eliezer’s self-interaction is given by the

sourceless combination of half of the retarded Li´enard-Wiechert self-potential minus half

of the advanced Li´enard-Wiechert self-potential, but multiplied by a renormalizing factor

of (1 + 2k). This gives the following concise description of the ES; Charges interact with

themselves via the semi-diﬀerence of Li´enard-Wiechert self-potentials and with other charges

via a linear combination of Li´enard-Wiechert potentials. In Eliezer’s theory the electron and

the proton of a hydrogen atom have the following equations of motion [4]

X. APPENDIX B: LINEAR STABILITY ANALYSIS ALONG THE ˆz DIRECTION

In this appendix we perform the linear stability analysis of the circular orbits for dis-

placements perpendicular to the orbital plane, henceforth called the ˆz-direction. We expand

to second order the implicit light-cone condition and the action (7), in the same way of Sec-

tion V. The linearized-z dynamics is uncoupled from the planar dynamics. The Cartesian

coordinates of a transversely perturbed circular orbit are deﬁned as

Notice that the quadratic term Z2c ˙Z2c on the right-hand side of Eq. (61) can be dropped

because it represents an exact Gauge that does not aﬀect the Euler-Lagrange equations of

motion. We also expand the argument of the sign function of the right-hand side of Eq. (61)

(76)

where we have included the scaling factor r2

b as of Eq. (69). Along the trajectory of the

proton, the delayed Li`enard-Wiechert interaction with the electron is the main oﬀending

force against the velocity, instead of the much smaller protonic self-interaction. Using the

Page series in the same way of Ref. [13], we ﬁnd a force against the protonic velocity of the

same magnitude of Eq.(76), as illustrated in Fig. 1. These oﬀending forces destabilize the

unperturbed circular motion with a small torque and a slow dissipation. In quantum elec-

trodynamics (QED) the circular Bohr orbits[3] of hydrogen correspond to excited states that

decay to the ground state in a life-time of about 106 turns. Using Eq. (76) to estimate the

energy dissipation along circular orbits of the atomic magnitude, one ﬁnds a net dissipation

of about 4 electron-volts after the life-time of 106 turns, an order-one fraction of the biding

energy (13.6 electron-volts). This radiative instability in the slow timescale is an incomplete

picture of the dynamics because it disregards the fast stiﬀ motion that is present because

of the delay. Let us postulate heuristically that along some special circular orbits the fast

dynamics encircles the circular orbit as illustrated in Fig. 2. If the linearization about the

circular orbit, Eq. (47), is averaged over a timescale of some turns, the stiﬀ dynamics goes

away and the resulting variable is a slow moving drift (representing the recoil of the state

26

of resonant dissipation). For that slow motion we have

¯ξ1(τ ) = ¯ξ1+(τ ) = ¯ξ1−(τ ),
¯ξ2(τ ) = ¯ξ2+(τ ) = ¯ξ2−(τ ),

since we are averaging the argument over a time of many turns, a time much longer than

the delay θ. We are ready to prove that the dynamics of the state of resonant dissipation

must necessarily involve a nonlinear term of the expansion about a circular orbit.

Lemma: If the averaged dynamics is determined only by the linear terms plus the oﬀend-

ing forcing, the state of resonant dissipation is impossible. To show this we average the full

equation of motion of the ξ1 variable, which is

¯l1ξ −

ib1θ3 + NL = 0,

where ¯l1ξ stands for the average of Eq. (41) and NL stands for the average of the nonlinear

terms. The time averages of the ﬁrst and second derivatives in Eq. (41) are zero, such that

discarding the nonlinear term of Eq. (78) yields the non-homogeneous linear equation

Performing the same average for the other three coordinates, we obtain a system of four

non-homogeneous linear equations. The matrix of this linear system has a zero determinant

that is directly related to the Galilean translation mode of the circular orbit, such that it

deﬁnes a singular linear operator. On top of that, the forcing term turns out to be out of

the Kernel of the singular linear operator, such that the linear system has no solution at all!

This completes the proof of our lemma.

The above lemma suggests the participation of the nonlinear terms to achieve the state

of resonant dissipation of Fig. 2. A nonlinear term with a nonzero average is just another

name for a resonance. Inspecting the nonlinear terms of the self-interaction force we ﬁnd

that, because of the fast frequency of the stiﬀ terms, even at small amplitudes the stiﬀ terms

give a large contribution to the self-force, enough to balance the oﬀending force of Eq.(76).

Our perturbation scheme is improper because we started with a guiding orbit that exists

only because of the nonlinear collaboration of the fast spinning terms. The nonlinear terms

where we assume that

radius rb, and u1 and R1 are deﬁned by Eq. (47). We see that the stiﬀ nonlinear terms can

balance the oﬀending force at the electron even at the small amplitude

This distance is a small fraction of the orbital radius and it represent a length of

which for θ in the atomic scale is less than 30 classical electronic radia. This is the radius

of the stiﬀ torus, a very reasonable physical length. Notice also that the velocity associated

with the stiﬀ motion is given by

which is much lesser than the speed of light for θ in the atomic scale.

Last, we mention a derivation of Eq.

(49) from the equations of motion in the form

(78); This can be accomplished by placing the linearization about the stiﬀ torus on the

left-hand side (henceforth called the Kernel) and the forcing and nonlinear terms on the

right-hand side. In this way the right-hand side has to be orthogonal to the left-eigenvectors

of the Kernel, which is Freedholm’s alternative theorem discussed for example in Refs. [23].

Multiplying the Kernel by a left-eigenvector and integrating on the fast timescale has exactly

the form of the conservation law for angular momentum on the slow time scale. This shall

be studied elsewhere.

We discuss applications of the quantile concept of trajecto-
ries and velocities to the propagation of electromagnetic sig-
nals in wave guides of varying cross section. Quantile motion
is a general description of the transport properties of measur-
able conserved quantities in quantum mechanics as well as in
classical electrodynamics. In the latter case we consider the
quantile motion of electromagnetic energy as the direct result
of a physical measurement. In this sense the quantile veloc-
ity corresponds to the electromagnetic signal velocity also in
the presence of barriers and inhomogeneities in the medium
of propagation. We show that this signal velocity is always
smaller than the speed of light in vacuum. Using numerical
examples we demonstrate how typical wave phenomena can
be described in terms of the quantile motion.

I. INTRODUCTION

In recent years the tunneling of an evanescent electro-
magnetic pulse in a wave guide with a cross section re-
duced over part of the longitudinal extension of the wave
guide has been studied. A series of microwave experi-
ments [1–4] claims to have found superluminal tunneling
velocities. The velocity of the signal has been identiﬁed
with the velocity of the maximum of the pulse.

A physical detector always needs a certain amount of
energy to change its state, therefore we use the quantile
velocity of a density obtained by way of normalizing the
electromagnetic energy density of the pulse to unity [5–7].
A numerical simulation of the microwave experiments
with wave packets in wave guides with varying cross sec-
tion is carried through. The quantile velocity of wave
packets is studied numerically.
It is shown rigorously
that the quantile velocity is not superluminal. A short
discussion of the quantile velocity in dispersive and ab-
sorptive media is presented. For a critical discussion of
superluminal velocities of electromagnetic signals see also
P. Thoma at al. [8], G. Raithel [9], G. Diener [10], and
the contribution of H. Goenner in this workshop [11].

VARYING CROSS SECTIONS. UNITARITY

We shall consider a wave guide of rectangular cross
section and perfectly conducting walls, extending in the
. The simplest
longitudinal z direction from
construction allowing an interpretation in terms of tun-
neling for an electromagnetic signal propagating in the
wave guide is obtained by assuming a narrowing of the
cross section, e.g., in the transverse x direction extending
to the left of the origin for z > 0 as shown in Fig. VI.
An electromagnetic wave moving from the right towards
the narrowing of the cross section will be aﬀected in a
similar way as the quantum-mechanical wave function of
a particle incident onto a potential step at z = 0.

≥

To further simplify the problem we consider only the
propagation of TE-waves of the type Hn0 for n = 1, 2, . . ..
Such a situation can indeed be realized if we choose a con-
stant height of the wave guide (b in Fig. VI) small enough
for all waves of the type Hnm with m
1 to be evanes-
cent [12]. Thus, the stationary electromagnetic ﬁeld in
the wave guide reduces to three ﬁeld components, Ey,
Hx, and Hz, each depending on x and z. One of the ﬁeld
components can be considered as independent, e.g., Ey,
whereas the other two follow from the Maxwell equations,
e.g., iωµµ0H =
E, where ω is the frequency of the
wave and µ = 1 is the magnetic permeability of vacuum.
It is worth noting that according to a well-known result
[13,14] the magnetic ﬁeld components are singular at the
sharp edge of the narrowing. This implies an increase of
the magnetic energy at the cost of the electric energy in
the wave guide [12,14].

Equation (13) predicts the increase in the magnitude of
the transverse magnetic ﬁeld component Hx at z = 0,
whereas the shape of the ﬁeld there obviously coincides
with that of the incoming mode Hm0. Thus, the approx-
imation leading to (12) seems appropriate in the limiting
case of geometric optics, i.e., if the wave length of the
incoming wave is short compared to the cross sections a
and a′ of the wave guide. In the case of an evanescent
wave for z > 0, however, more terms in the expansion
(11) are needed for the boundary conditions at z = 0 to
be fulﬁlled. Therefore, a numerical solution of equation
(6) is used in what follows.

We now turn to a more complicated geometry for the
wave guide involving two boundary conditions at z = 0
and z = L, where L is the length of a symmetrically

placed barrier (reduction of the cross section as shown in
Fig. VI). Numerical simulations for the stationary ﬁeld
components in the wave guide are shown in Fig. VI and
Fig. 4. The continuity of the transverse ﬁeld components
at the wave-guide aperture as well as the magnetic-ﬁeld
singularities at the narrowing edges are shown in Fig. VI.
Figure 4 is a spectral diagram with reﬂection and trans-
mission coeﬃcients (in the regions z < 0 and z > L,
respectively) of the incoming as well as of higher modes.
Because of the magnetic-ﬁeld singularities in a real
experiment the maxima of the magnetic ﬁeld strength
would always be located in the vicinity of the wave-guide
edges. Therefore, they give no information on the veloc-
ity of a tunneling electromagnetic signal. If, instead, we
refer to the electromagnetic energy density in the wave
guide we can avoid dealing with singularities by recalling
that the singularities of the energy density are integrable.

complete analogy to the probability and current density
in the one-dimensional tunneling in quantum mechanics
[15]. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the energy

of electromagnetic signals in wave guides.

III. TUNNELING OF WAVE PACKETS.
COMPARISON WITH EXPERIMENTS

In the following we construct tunneling wave packets
in the wave guide as a superposition of the stationary
solutions found above. For such a superposition to be a
propagating, incoming wave in the region to the right of
the barrier (z < 0) it must not contain wave components
below the cutoﬀ frequency ωc (evanescent components)
in this region. Therefore we use, e.g., for the electric ﬁeld
component Ey the expression

Ey(x, z, t) =

dω f (ω)Eys(x, z; ω)e−iωt ,

(20)

∞

ωc

Z

where f (ω) is the spectral distribution of frequencies nor-
malized in the interval (ωc,
) and Eys is the stationary
electric ﬁeld component.

In Fig. 5–Fig. 7 numerical simulations with Gaussian-
like wave packets in the wave guide are shown. The spec-
tral distribution f (ω) in this case is given by

where ˜N is a normalization factor, ω0 is the mean fre-
quency and σω is the spectral width of the wave packet.
Figure 5 demonstrates the tunneling process through
a symmetrically placed barrier in the wave guide for an
incoming mode of the type H10. Most of the frequencies
in the spectrum (21) are taken above the cutoﬀ frequency
ω′
c of the barrier region L > z > 0. Correspondingly, the
transmission rate is high. We observe that the shape of
the reﬂected and transmitted wave packets is substan-
tially deformed. Among other reasons this is due to the
energy transfer to higher modes other than the incoming

3

mode H10. In terms of the evolution of the wave-packet
maxima, we start with a single maximum in the incoming
wave and end up with many transmitted maxima propa-
gating with diﬀerent velocities in the wave guide.

In Fig. 6 the resonant tunneling of a Gaussian wave
packet is shown. The frequency spectrum contains many
transmission resonances (see also Fig. 4) leading to mul-
tiple reﬂections of the wave packet at the barrier walls.
In Fig. 7 we compute the longitudinal energy density
(z, t) in the time domain at a ﬁxed position z behind
W
the barrier and for diﬀerent barrier lengths L. The wave
packet was chosen such that tunneling takes place mainly
in the evanescent regime. Under this condition we ob-
serve that the maximum of the wave packet can appear
behind the barrier earlier than when moving in the free
space with the vacuum speed of light c. This behavior
becomes more obvious for large L as the transmission
rate decreases signiﬁcantly.

As another example we consider the tunneling of
Kaiser–Bessel wave packets [16] with a limited and dis-
crete frequency spectrum in a given interval [ω−, ω+].

−
bution (22) ensures optimality of the wave-packet local-
ization in the time domain and was also used in the
microwave experiments [1].
In Fig. 8 we compute the
tunneling time of the maximum of a Kaiser–Bessel wave
packet between the beginning and end of the barrier as a
function of the barrier length L. We consider wave pack-
ets tunneling in the propagating and evanescent regime
and compare in the respective case the tunneling ve-
locity of the maximum with the group velocity in the
In
wave guide and the velocity of light in vacuum c.
the evanescent case we observe the tunneling velocity of
the maximum of the wave packet for long barriers to be
independent of the barrier length L. This behavior cor-
responds to the Hartman eﬀect which is well-known from
the quantum-mechanical tunneling [17,18]. Thus, evanes-
cent tunneling of the maximum becomes highly superlu-
minal. In the example of Fig. 8 we obtain a tunneling
127.78 ps at a barrier length L = 100 mm
time τT ≈
for the maximum of the wave packet. The correspond-
2.6c in very good
ing tunneling velocity is vT = L/τT ≈
agreement with the experimental result given in [1].

IV. QUANTILE MOTION OF
ELECTROMAGNETIC SIGNALS. CAUSALITY
OF SIGNAL PROPAGATION

We measure the arrival time of a signal with a detec-
tor placed at the ﬁxed position zP. We assume that the
region in which the energy of an electromagnetic pulse is
essentially diﬀerent from zero is initially far away from
the position zP of the detector. The detection of the elec-
tromagnetic signal requires the deposition of a certain
amount W of energy in the detector to cause a change
of its state indicating the arrival of the signal. This is
equivalent to the condition

on the time t of arrival of the signal. Repeated mea-
surements at diﬀerent positions zP1, zP2, . . . yield arrival
times t1, t2, . . . corresponding to these positions. They
are discrete points on the trajectory zP = zP(t) deﬁned
by requiring the condition

to hold at all times t.
If we call W0 the total energy
contained in the pulse then P = W/W0 is the fraction of
(z, t)/W0 is
energy needed for detection and ̺(z, t) =
the normalized energy density. Equation (24) can be put
into the form

(25)

which is the same as Equation (11) of [5]. Therefore,
zP = zP(t) is the quantile trajectory of the electromag-
netic signal. As to be expected it depends on the fraction
P , and thus on the sensitivity W = P W0 of the detector.
The signal velocity is then given by

vP(t) =

dzP(t)
dt

.

(26)

Examples of quantile trajectories for tunneling Gaus-
sian signals in wave guides of varying cross section are
given in Fig. VI and Fig. VI. Figure VI shows that the
presence of a barrier in the wave guide may only lead
to a slower signal propagation at any give time t and
for every detector sensitivity P . Thus, no quantile signal
velocity larger than the speed of light in vacuum c is pos-
sible. Especially, in the evanescent tunneling regime (see
Fig. VIc) the tunneling velocity is much smaller than c,
whereas, as physically expected, most of the trajectories
turn back to the reﬂection region.

The behavior of the quantile trajectories for diﬀerent P
values reﬂects several properties of the tunneling process.
In Fig. VIb the reﬂected and transmitted quantile tra-
jectories split into trajectory bunches propagating with

4

diﬀerent velocities in the wave guide. They correspond
to the electromagnetic modes produced in the tunneling
as described in the previous section. This coincidence
between the behavior of quantile trajectories and typi-
cal wave phenomena in tunneling can be observed also in
resonant tunneling (see Fig. VI).

The causality of quantile motion can explicitly be de-
rived, for instance, in the case of tunneling TE-waves.
Using the deﬁnition (24) and the continuity relation (15)
we derive the quantile velocity (24), c.f. Equation (13)

vP(t) =

Trajectories solving this equation have also been stud-

Thus, vq(t) never exceeds the vacuum speed of light c,
i.e., the signal propagation described by the quantile tra-
jectory is causal. This result is a general property of the
quantile motion and holds independently of the type of
the tunneling wave.

exchange is characterized by a loss of energy, since part of
the mechanical energy of the oscillators is steadily trans-
formed into heat. Thus, three diﬀerent kinds of energy
have to be considered, the electromagnetic energy of the
pulse, the mechanical energy of the oscillating charges
of the medium, and the thermal energy stored in the
medium [27]. Each of them may be considered as the
energy of an open subsystem of the closed system char-
acterized by the total energy which is conserved.

We apply the concept of quantile motion to the wave
propagation in dispersive media. Suﬃcient condition for
this is the existence of a measurable quantity with a pos-
itive spatial density (see [5–7]). Since the total energy in
the medium is conserved, its density fulﬁlls a continuity
equation similar to (14). Thus, quantile trajectories for
the total energy in a dispersive and absorptive medium
may be easily deﬁned in complete analogy to the above
description for the (conserved) electromagnetic energy in
wave guides. The application of quantile motion for the
electromagnetic signal propagation in dispersive media
has been carried through in [27]. In all cases it has been
shown that the quantile velocities for the signal remain
below the vacuum speed of light c. An argument anal-
ogous to the one leading to (28) shows rigorously that
the quantile velocity in the oscillator model of dispersive
and absorptive media is always smaller than the vacuum
speed of light. This and related results will be presented
in a forthcoming publication.

V. NOTE ON THE QUANTILE MOTION IN
DISPERSIVE AND ABSORPTIVE MEDIA

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

It has been known for a long time that electromag-
netic signal propagation in the spectral region of a disper-
sive medium characterized by anomalous dispersion and
strong absorption leads to superluminal phase and group
velocity [20–23]. Even though the shape of the propa-
gating signal may be substantially deformed in compar-
ison to the shape of the incoming wave, a propagation
velocity has been considered which coincides with the
velocity of one of the pulse maxima. Then the velocity
obtained this way is again superluminal [23]. This result
was recently reconﬁrmed by the photon experiments at
Berkeley [24,25] and by the experiments with photonic
barriers in wave guides [26]. However, if one considers
instead of the pulse maxima the energy transport in the
medium no superluminal velocities occur. Diener [10]
suggests a procedure for separating propagating and non-
propagating parts of energy of the electromagnetic pulse
and obtains subluminal velocities for the energy trans-
port in the medium.

Because of the interaction of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
with the dispersive medium, energy is permanently trans-
ferred between the propagating pulse and the oscillating
charges in the medium. In the presence of dissipation this

The concept of quantile motion has been applied to
the propagation of electromagnetic waves in wave guides
of varying cross section and in dispersive and absorptive
media. It has been shown that the signal velocity mea-
sured with a detector of ﬁnite sensitivity never becomes
superluminal. In the context of the propagation of elec-
tromagnetic signals the quantile velocity is a generaliza-
tion to detectors with ﬁnite sensitivity of Sommerfeld’s
concept [20] of a front velocity describing the speed of a
signal measured with a detector of inﬁnite sensitivity.

FIG. 7. Example of the superluminal tunneling of the maximum of a tunneling Gaussian wave packet. The longitudinal
energy density W(z, t) is shown in the time domain at a ﬁxed position behind the barrier ∆z = 20 cm away from the position
of the center of the wave packet at t = 0. The dimensions of the symmetric wave guide are a = 1 cm and a
= 0.5 cm for
diﬀerent barrier lengths L (see Fig. VI). The incident wave packet is of the type H10 with frequencies centered at ω0 = 15 GHz
and spectral width σω = 0.6 GHz. Thus, evanescent tunneling occurs. The box, the triangle, and the circle correspond to the
arrival times of the pulse maximum in vacuum, in a wave guide without barrier, and in the wave guide with a barrier of length
L, respectively. If the barrier is long enough the tunneling velocity of the pulse maximum becomes superluminal (case (c) and
(d)).

FIG. 8. Tunneling times of the pulse maximum and Hartman eﬀect. The transmission time of the pulse maximum (solid
line), the time intervals corresponding to the free motion of the pulse maximum in vacuum (dashed line) and in the wave
guide without barrier (broken line) for a Kaiser–Bessel wave packet are plotted as functions of the barrier length L. In both
cases the incoming wave packet is a superposition of N = 800 frequencies in the interval 51.52 GHz ≤ ω ≤ 57.81 GHz with the
spectral distribution (22) for α = 1. (a) Non-evanescent tunneling. The cross sections of the wave guide are a = 22.86 mm and
= 18 mm. The behavior of the tunneling times is “normal”. (b) Evanescent tunneling. Here, the same tunneling situation
a
as in [1] is computed, i.e., the two cross sections of the wave guide are a = 22.86 mm and a
= 15.8 mm. The transmission time
τT = L/vm for long barriers remains nearly constant and, thus, implies superluminal tunneling for the pulse maximum.

FIG. 9. Quantile trajectories. (a) Non-evanescent tunnel-
ing. Trajectories for 0.05 ≤ P ≤ 0.95 in steps of ∆P = 0.02
are shown. The dimensions of the symmetric wave guide (see
Fig. VI) are a = 1 cm, a′ = 0.3 cm, and L = 5 cm. The incom-
ing Gaussian wave packet is of the type H10 with ω0 = 60 GHz
and σω = 0.3 GHz. (b) Evanescent tunneling with short bar-
rier. The cross sections a and a
are the same as in (a).
The length of the barrier is L = 0.1 cm. The incoming wave
packet with ω0 = 30 GHz and σω = 0.3 GHz is evanescent
in the region inside the barrier.
(c) Evanescent tunneling
with long barrier. The length of the barrier is chosen to
L = 1 cm. The incoming wave packet has ω0 = 22.5 GHz
and σω = 0.3 GHz. Because of the strong reﬂection, trajecto-
ries for 10−3 ≤ P ≤ 2.5 × 10−2 in steps of ∆P = 5 × 10−4
are computed. Also in this case no superluminal tunneling is
observed.

ment shown in (a).

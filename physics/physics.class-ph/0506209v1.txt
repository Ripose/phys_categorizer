Abstract

The interaction between singular and regular ﬁelds is considered for Lorentz-
invariant scalar and vector wave equations. The singular ﬁeld is generated by a Dirac
source term. Its dynamics are deduced from the total ﬁeld Lagrangian. At non-
relativistic speeds, the resulting equations of motion are those of a mass in a scalar
potential. Using this method we deduce the relationship between source amplitude
(scalar gravitational mass) and dynamic mass (inertial mass). Generalising this
method implies Lorentz forces for charge singularities in the electromagnetic ﬁeld
and describes the dynamics and interaction of hypothetical magnetic monopoles.

Introduction

The method presented builds on the action principle which oﬀers a general tool to
describe both particle and ﬁeld dynamics. This principle represents one of the great
uniﬁcation in physics and applies equally well to Newtonian mechanics [1], general
relativity and electromagnetic ﬁelds[2]. Using this single principle it is possible
to deduce the Euler-Lagrange equations describing the evolution of one system or
of many interacting systems. However describing these interactions requires the
assumption of an additional action term. In this paper, we show that it is possible
to eliminate this additional assumption and deduce the reaction dynamics of the
singularity. In the case of scalar ﬁeld singularities we derive Newton’s equation of
motion together with the equivalence between Newtonian gravitational mass and
inertial mass. For charges and magnetic monopoles we deduce their associated
Lorentz force.

Singularities, vortices and topological defects have received considerable atten-
tion over the years; they determine the properties of many interesting materials such
as vortices in superconductors [3], superﬂuids [4] and two-dimensional condensate
[5], dislocations and defects in solid [6] and liquid crystals [7], optical phase singu-
larities and optical vortices [8] and even topological defect in cosmology [9]. In this
paper, we use singularities together with the ﬁeld action principle to deduce their
dynamical behaviour. The method presented here is general and can be applied to
all of the ﬁelds mentioned above.

For clarity reasons we treat ﬁrst the simplest case possible that being a Dirac
source singularity in the Lorentz-invariant scalar wave equation. This leads to equa-
tions of motion similar to Newtonian mechanics (section 2). The method is gener-
alised for other singularities and other ﬁelds such as a charges (section 3) where the
electromagnetic ﬁeld implies the Lorentz force. In the last section, we apply this
principle to deduce the equations of motion of hypothetical magnetic monopoles
where the dynamics concurs with the one obtained through charge-monopole sym-
metry considerations [10].

2 Scalar ﬁeld singularity: Inertia

Before considering the anatomy of the ﬁeld singularity, let us start by deducing the
Euler-Lagrange equation for a scalar mass-less ﬁeld U described by the following
action

SU =

L(U ) d3x dt =

1

c2 (∂tU )2 − (∇U )2 d3x dt

(1)

where L(U ) corresponds to the Lagrangian density, ∇ = (∂x, ∂y, ∂z) to the nabla
operator and c to the speed of light. The action principle implies that the scalar
ﬁeld U is solution of the standard homogenous wave equation

t U = 0

∇2U −

1
c2 ∂2
where ∇2 stands for the Laplacian operator. The next step in the singularity dynam-
ics theory is to deﬁne a singular source term that maintains the Lorentz-invariance
of the supporting ﬁeld equation. Starting from the wave equation (2), we can deﬁne
the stationary singular ﬁeld Us as the time independent solution in the presence of
a Dirac source at the origin of the coordinate system

(2)

∇2Us −

1
c2 ∂2
where ms corresponds for the source amplitude. To deﬁne the Lorentz-invariant
singularity, we consider equation (3) in a reference frame having the constant velocity
−v with respect to the stationary singularity. In this reference frame the singularity
has the velocity v. The transformation between the two reference frames is [11]:

t Us = msδ(r)

(cid:16)
where γ = (1 − v2/c2)−1/2 and the prime stands for the coordinates in the moving
reference frame. The subscripts k and ⊥ represent the vectorial components parallel
and perpendicular to the velocity v. Applying these transformations to equation (3)
leads us to a constant velocity moving singularity. Beforehand, we remark that the
singularity can be decomposed into two components, δ(r) = δ(rk)δ(r⊥). Further, the
wave equation and the scalar ﬁeld Us is invariant with respect to the transformation
that is it remains unchanged in the transition from one reference frame to another.

We can now write the equation of a moving singularity on an arbitrary path rs(t)

with the velocity v = ˙rs. The singular ﬁeld Us is solution of

and corresponds to a retarded potential.

In the following, we are considering the action principle in the case of the linear
superposition of the singular ﬁeld as deﬁned in equation (5) and a given external ﬁeld
U0 solution of (2). We remark here that the only free parameter of the system is the
position of the Dirac singularity and its velocity. The Euler-Lagrange equation of
motion is deduced when the action is stationary with respect path of the singularity.
The total action integral may be expressed as

This action integral can be decomposed into two parts. The ﬁrst integral has no
cross-terms between the external ﬁeld and the singular ﬁeld. This integral is inde-
pendent with respect to the position of the singularity and its variation is zero. This
leaves only the second integral ∆Ss for the action principle

∆Ss =

where we have integrated the action by parts and assumed the singular ﬁeld to be
zero on the boundary of the integration region. Next, we use equation (5) to replace
the singular ﬁeld by the Dirac singularity and ﬁnally we integrate in Lagrangian
density in the spacial domain.

One can also deﬁne a diﬀerential relationship between the two masses by taking
the scalar product between the velocity and equation (6). This leads to a energy
balance equation that generalises the famous equations E = mc2 to the dynamic
domain.

Indeed, the energy balance equation shows that the variation of the inertial mass is
proportional to its potential energy variation.

Finally, we can deduce Newtons equation of motion for non-relativistic velocities

and far from any other singularities

3 Charge singularity: Lorentz force

In order to deduce the laws of motion of a charge we have to consider a singularity of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld described by Maxwell’s equations. We proceed in a similar
way to the scalar singularity case. In a ﬁrst instance, we deduce the homogenous
Maxwell’s equations using the action principle. In a second step, we introduce a
singular source to these equations making sure that their symmetries are maintained
(i.e. Lorentz-invariance). Then, we write down the Lagrangian integral of the total
ﬁeld composed of an external ﬁeld and the singular ﬁeld. Finally, the action principle
is applied to the total Lagrangian integral and the dynamics of the singularity is
deduced.

The electromagnetic ﬁeld action is expressed as:

and where V and A are the electric scalar and magnetic vector potential respectively.
The vacuum permittivity and permeability is given by ǫ0 and µ0. The third equation
corresponds to Lorentz gauge. Applying the action principle with respect to the
potentials lets us deduce Maxwell’s equations in absence of charges:

Like in the scalar case, we consider a single stationary Dirac singularity qδ(r) in
equation of the divergence of the electrical ﬁeld (12c). The eﬀect on the electromag-
netic ﬁeld of this source is equivalent to a stationary point charge q at the origin.
The singular charge ﬁelds Eq and Bq are solutions of the in-homogenous Maxwell’s
equations:

The main diﬀerence with the scalar case is in that the potential ﬁelds Vq and
Aq change in the transition from one reference frame to another. Indeed, using the
moving frame deﬁned by (2) we have for the potentials:

q⊥
q = γ(Vq + v · Aq)
V ′
where the speed of light is given by 1 = c2ǫ0µ0. Combining the transformations (2)
and (14) together with the deﬁnition of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds (11) we can
deduce the transformation relationship between these ﬁelds

where the relativistic coeﬃcient γ in the source terms cancelled out. The reason for
this is the covariant behaviour of the electromagnetic potentials as opposed to the
invariant scalar potential in equation (5).

This procedure gives us the form of the singularity following an arbitrary path
rq(t) with the velocity v = ˙rq. The resulting vector singularity is equivalent to a
charge and its associated current. The singular charge ﬁelds Eq and Bq are solutions
of the in-homogenous Maxwell’s equations:

−∇ × Eq − ∂tBq = 0

1
µ0

∇ × Bq − ǫ0∂tEq = qvδ(r − rq)

∇ · ǫ0Eq = qδ(r − rq)

∇ · Bq = 0.

(16)

To deduce the equations of motion of this moving charge singularity we deﬁne
the total ﬁeld as the linear superposition of the singular ﬁelds Eq and Bq and the
external ﬁelds E0 and B0:

where the external ﬁelds are decomposed onto the external scalar and vector poten-
tials

E = Eq + E0
B = Bq + B0

E0 = −∇V0 − ∂tA0
B0 = ∇ × A0

0 = ∇ · A0 + ǫ0µ0∂tV0.

4 Magnetic Monopole singularity

Magnetic monopoles are hypothetical particles that behave in a similarly to charged
particles with magnetic and electric ﬁelds inverted ([10]). The monopoles correspond
to sources of the magnetic ﬁeld in equation (12d). In the following we are deducing
the equations of motion of magnetic source singularities by considering a Dirac
source qmδ(r) in equations (12d) where qm corresponds to the monopole strength.
Before proceeding further, we have to generalise the potential decomposition of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Indeed, the potentials that we used for the charged singu-
larities does not allow the presence of sources of the magnetic ﬁeld. Conventionally
the magnetic ﬁeld is by deﬁnition a rotational ﬁeld. Therefore, we deﬁne a symmet-
ric electromagnetic potential decomposition that includes an additional magnetic
scalar and electric vector potential.

where the subscripts (q, m) stand respectively for the charge and monopole poten-
tials or ﬁelds. Using all the newly deﬁned potential deﬁnitions we can apply again
the action principle the electromagnetic action deﬁned by equation (10). The re-
sulting evolution equations are identical to equations (12). The only diﬀerence is
the possibility to deﬁne a monopole source density in equation (22d).

For the monopole singularity, we consider a single stationary Dirac singularity
at the origin. The singularity constitutes the free term of equation (22d) and acts
as a source of magnetic ﬁeld. The singular ﬁelds Em and Bm are solution of:

In this case there are four potential ﬁelds Vsq, Vsm, Asq and Asm and the
electric and magnetic ﬁeld is deﬁned by equations (21). Taking the same frame
transformation deﬁned by (2) we have for the potentials:

5 Conclusion

The ﬁeld generated by a singularity gives rise to the laws of motion of the singularity.
In other words, the action of the singularity on the ﬁeld implies its dynamic reaction
to the ﬁeld. We have shown this to be the case for neutral bodies, charges and
hypothetical magnetic monopoles. Using our method we have deduced not only the
dynamics of masses, but also the relationship between the ”gravitational” source
strength and the associated inertial mass. The charge singularity was shown to be
the origin of the Lorentz force. The magnetic monopoles have an equivalent Lorentz
force.

The conventional Lorentz force does not involve the magnetic monopole ﬁeld.
Reciprocally, the monopole Lorentz force does not involve ﬁelds originating from
charged particles. Consequently, charges and magnetic monopoles do not interact,
making the discovery of monopoles using charges diﬃcult. A major question to be
addressed concerns the role played by electromagnetic radiation. Can it provide the
link between charges and magnetic monopoles?

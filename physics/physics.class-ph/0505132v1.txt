Quasiresonance

February 2, 2008

Abstract

The concept of quasiresonance was introduced in connection with inelastic collisions be-
tween one atom and a vibro-rotationally excited diatomic molecule. In its original form, the
collisions induce quasiresonant transfer of energy between the internal degrees of freedom
of the diatom: there is a surprisingly accurate low order rational value for the ratio of the
changes in the vibrational and rotational classical actions, provided the vibrational and rota-
tional frequencies of the diatom are approximately related by low order rational values, and
the collision was longer that the rotational period of the molecule. In this paper we show
that quasiresonance can be extended to many other processes and systems, and that it may
be understood in terms of the adiabatic invariance theory and the method of averaging.

Introduction

The term quasiresonant vibration-rotation energy transfer (QRVR) was ﬁrst introduced [1, 2] in
the context of low velocity inelastic collision processes between one atom and a vibro-rotationally
excited diatomic molecule. These are transitions which dominate all other transitions over a
signiﬁcant range of initial conditions and occur when there is a highly speciﬁc and eﬃcient
inelastic transfer of energy between the internal vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom
of the diatom.

The ﬁrst experimental evidence of QRVR [1] was reported in a level-resolved study of vi-
brotationally inelastic collisions between Li∗
2 and noble gas atoms. The experimental results
show remarkably sharp, strong peaks in the vibro-rotational inelastic rate constant at very spe-
ciﬁc high initial rotational states with values that substantially exceed the purely rotationally
inelastic rate constant. A extremely good correlation between the change in the rotational (j)
and vibrational (v) quantum numbers of the diatomic at the most important peak of the ﬁnal
rotational states was also observed, with a very strong propensity rule ∆j =

4∆v.

Since then QRVR transfer has been observed in a wide variety of collision species and inter-
action potentials at diﬀerent energy ranges [3, 4]. It has been suggested as a possible relaxation

mechanism of rotationally excited light molecules, such as H2 molecules formed in laboratory
traps or interstellar clouds, and good candidate to provide a rotational inversion mechanism in
rotationally pumped lasers at ultracold temperatures [1]. Also, a similar quasiresonance energy
transfer mechanism has been shown to control the process of predissociation for the most weakly
bound state of van der Waals complexes [5].

In general, the qualitative features that characterize the quasiresonant vibration-rotation
energy transfer are a large vibrationally inelastic cross section with very narrow ﬁnal rotational
state distributions, a strong correlation

∆v,

with p/q a rational fraction involving small integers. The correlation becomes stronger at higher
initial rotational states and lower collision velocities. Finally, experimental results obtained for
diﬀerent collision species also indicate a remarkable insensitivity to both the initial vibrational
state and the nature of the interaction potential [1, 3, 4].

(cid:19)

These striking properties of the quasiresonant vibro-rotational energy transfer eﬀect have
stimulated a number of theoretical studies [2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], both classical trajectories
analysis and quantum mechanical computations, of inelastic cross sections and rate coeﬃcients
for collisions between one atom and a rotationally excited diatom at ordinary and ultracold
temperatures. The good qualitative agreement between classical and quantum results suggested
that the classical dynamics of the system is playing a signiﬁcant role in the mechanism underlying
the QRVR energy transfer.

Classical trajectory studies [2, 6, 7] have shed light on the dynamics involved in this process.
It has been observed [2] that collisional processes that occur at high molecular rotation states and
low collision velocities are composed of a sequence of small collisions, or collisionettes, in which
the interaction potential presents remarkable peaks. These collisionettes take place whenever
the rapidly rotating diatom and the external atom come closer to each other, with the diatom
in its outer vibrational turning point and the molecular axis nearly collinear with the atom.
In between collisionettes the interaction potential becomes insigniﬁcant and the rotational and
vibrational actions remain nearly constant.

The ratio between the change in the two molecular actions is approximately (and often
spectacularly close to) a low order rational ratio of the vibrational and rotational classical
molecular frequencies. This suggests that the vibrational and rotational frequencies of the diatom
are in approximate low-order resonance when that QRVR transfer occurs, and consequently a
commensurate relation of the type

p
q

(2)

holds, with nv and nj small integers and ωv and ωj the classical vibrational and rotational
molecular frequencies.

The observed frequency-locking relation (2) suggested that the interaction potential is act-
ing as a nonlinear external coupling between the internal vibrational and rotational molecular
oscillators. This conjecture was later supported by Hoving et al.
[6] who explained QRVR

transfer in terms of adiabatic invariance and presented numerical evidence which showed that
this phenomenon is associated with the appearance of very large isolated nonlinear resonances
in the phase of the system. Numerical results also indicated that the general rule (1) followed by
the molecular rotational and vibrational quantum numbers in the dominant QRVR transitions,
which according to (2) can be expressed as

is connected to the conservation of the action

nv∆v + nj∆v = 0

I = nvv + njj

(3)

(4)

Quasiresonant energy transfer processes have also been observed in atom-diatom collisions
that occur at ultralow energies [7]. However, in this regime there are new aspects that introduce
qualitative diﬀerences between the classical and quantum behaviors. The strong correlation
between ∆j and ∆v persists, but the magnitude can be much smaller than one quantum, making
the quantum transitions classically forbidden. In the quantum limit, signiﬁcant threshold eﬀects
appear in the quenching rate coeﬃcient in the zero temperature limit causing some of the most
relevant quasiresonant channels to remain closed due to energy conservation. Classically, the
collisionettes described in processes at higher energies are replaced by a strong modulation of
the interaction potential at the characteristic frequency of the quasiresonant transition. For
certain initial conditions the incoming atom can get temporarily trapped around the diatom,
bouncing several times before being rejected by the repulsive component of the interaction
potential. Although the temporal evolution of the atom along these trapping trajectories is a
extremely sensitive function of the initial conditions (chaotic scattering region), remarkably the
quasiresonant correlation (1) is still satisﬁed.

In this work we will focus on the classical analysis of quasiresonance. We will show that this
is a common eﬀect, not restricted to atom-diatom inelastic collisions, which arises from tran-
sient ”turning on” of interactions between quasi-resonant, i.e. not necessarily exactly resonant,
degrees of freedom. The same quasiresonance eﬀect will be shown to arise from an explicitly
time dependent transient “turning on” and one that occurs autonomously.

Although the work presented bears some relation with adiabatic switching [12], the con-
nection has not been explored. Adiabatic switching is a method for semiclassical quantization
which had some success in starting with a multidimensional separable problem of known quan-
tized actions and switching on interactions adiabatically, hoping that the actions do not change,
and thus allowing the energy with those actions to be read oﬀ of the trajectories which have
suﬀered the switching.

The paper is organized as follows. We begin in section 2 with the theoretical analysis of
classical system under a transient interaction. In section 3 we illustrate the main features of the
quasiresonance eﬀect numerically, using a two-oscillator resonant Hamiltonian, a new example
of quasiresonant system. Section 4 further analyzes the mechanisms behind quasiresonance,
especially from the point of view of phase space. Here we also present a more detailed discussion
of the quasiresonance eﬀect between the vibrational and rotational internal degrees of freedom

of a diatom molecule in slow inelastic collisions with an external atom. Finally, in section 5 we
summarize the main conclusions of the work.

2 Adiabatic invariants under a slow transient interaction

In this section we show that quasiresonance is a common eﬀect which arises from the cou-
pling of approximately resonant internal degrees of freedom of a classical system, perturbed by
some transient interaction with additional degrees of freedom. We start by considering a two-
dimensional integrable system H0, perturbed by the transient interaction with one structureless
particle. The Hamiltonian of the total system may be expressed as

H = H0(J) + Hk(P) + ǫV (J, F

, P, Q; x )

(J1, J2) and F

≡

where J
(Φ1, Φ2) are the action-angle variables that describe the unperturbed
system H0, Q and P the coordinate and the conjugate momentum (not necessarily action-angle
variables) of the incoming particle and Hk its kinetic energy. ǫ is a small parameter which
characterizes the magnitude of the interaction term. We will assume that the term satisﬁes the
condition

≡

V (J, F

, Q; x ) = 0

lim

≡

x (J, F

with x
, P, Q) an interaction parameter that controls the amplitude of the interaction
between the system H0 and the particle. In a typical collisional process this parameter would
correspond to the distance between centers of mass of the colliding species, which do not notice
the interaction potential unless they are close enough to each other.

We are interested in the analysis of a collisional event in which the transient interaction
of the system H0 with the particle induces a change in its internal state from the initial state

The secularity in the unperturbed Hamiltonian due to this resonance condition can be removed
applying standard secular perturbation theory [13]. Namely, we can perform a canonical trans-
formation from the variables (J, F ) to a new set of action-angle variables (I, f ), which deﬁne a
frame that rotates with the resonant frequency. Taking the generating function for the canonical
transformation as

Under these conditions, the dynamics of the system in the proximity of the nonlinear resonance
can be described by the averaged Hamiltonian

Since ¯H does not depend on the angle variable φ2 its conjugated action variable I2 is an adibatic
invariant of the motion in the proximity of the resonance. But, according to (12) and (13), this
adiabatic invariance of the action conjugated to the fast angle variable φ2 implies that

which gives the rational ratio in the action changes that is observed in the quasiresonance eﬀect.
Thus, a quasiresonance is implied by the existence of an adiabatic invariant characterizing the
quasiperiodic motion of the system, in the proximity of a nonlinear resonance between its internal
degrees of freedom.

−

From this perspective quasiresonance is merely the survival of an adiabatic action, corre-
sponding to a fast angle. However, subtleties regarding the boundaries of adiabaticity as probed
by the strength and duration of the interaction which couples the unperturbed actions leave a
rich subject to be explored.

2.1 Example: Atom-vibrotor collision

A nice illustration of quasiresonance eﬀect can be found in the dynamics of an atom, ﬁxed on
a spring and is rotating on a plane, which is slightly perturbed by the collision with a slow
incoming particle. Before the interaction occurs the dynamics of the unperturbed rotating atom
is described by the integrable Hamiltonian

Initially the atom is vibrating in and out as it rotates on a plane, tracing out a “gear”
shape which is actually ﬁxed in space if the radial and angular frequencies satisfy a resonance
condition (7), see panel a) in ﬁgure (2). More generally, the “gear” is slowly rotating clockwise
or counterclockwise initially, with angular frequency ˙φ1, i.e. the slow angle. The gear-shaped
potential is just the potential of the averaged Hamiltonian given in Eq. 17.

such variation produces a slow rotation of the gear, which starts moving as an eﬀective rigid
rotor, see panel b) in ﬁgure (2). The angular momentum associated with this rotating gear is
given by the new action variable Iθ, while the action conjugated to the rapid angle variable in
the rotating coordinate system, in this system the radial or vibrational action, is the modiﬁed
adiabatic invariant that satisﬁes the condition (19). Namely,

This example illustrates the physical nature of the reduced dimensionality system which results
when the average over the fast variable is performed. As long as the quasiresonance holds, the
reduced dimensionality object acts consistently as if it did not possess the degrees of freedom
removed by averaging.

2.2 Nonautonomous systems

The physical picture of the “gear” as the averaged Hamiltonian strongly suggests that an external
perturbation pushing non-reactively (nonautonomously) could play the role of the incident atom
in the example above, causing the gear to change precession in the same way as did collision
with the atom. Certainly the canonical transformation to slow and fast angle variables is still
relevant, as that involves only the “system”. Thus we consider an integrable system perturbed
by an explicitly time dependent interaction, i.e. the interaction parameter is x = x (t). In terms
of the action-angle variables (J, F ) of the unperturbed system, the total Hamiltonian may be
expressed as

H = H0(J) + ǫV (J, F

; x )

where ǫ is a small parameter that characterizes the perturbation strength, which we will assume
that satisﬁes the transient condition

lim
t→±∞

V (I, F

; x (t)) = 0

In order to remove the singularity associated with the resonance (7) between the unperturbed
frequencies (9), we again seek a canonical transformation from the variables (J, F ) to a new vari-
ables (I, f ) in the rotating coordinate system. We choose for such transformation the generating
function

F (I, F

, x ) = (M Φ2 −

N Φ1)I1 + Φ2I2 + f (I, F

where f is a multiply periodic function of the angles that can be expanded as the Fourier series

Let us now assume that the transient interaction is a function with slow time variation and,
therefore, we can consider ˙x as a small parameter that characterizes the slow change in the
interaction. Provided that the frequency ω2 is suﬃciently far from zero, (34) and (35) indicate
that the angle φ2 oscillates much faster than φ1 near the resonance. Under these conditions, the
slow motion of the system in this region can be described by the averaged Hamiltonian

Thus, the application of the averaging over the fast angle leads to its conjugated action as
the ﬁrst term of the series for the modiﬁed adibatic invariant of the system near a nonlinear
resonance. As in the autonomous system, such a modiﬁed invariant reﬂects the change that the
transient perturbation induces in the topology of the phase space trajectories in the proximity of
a nonlinear resonance zone. To zero order in the perturbation strength and slowness parameters,
the propensity rule associated with a quasiresonance arises also in a non-autonomous transient
interaction from the linear relation between the modiﬁed invariant and the action variables of
the unperturbed system.

3 Numerical studies and further analysis of quasiresonance

We have just seen that the quasiresonance can arise from a explicitly time dependent or an
autonomous transient interaction. A well deﬁned model system suitable for further study is
composed of two anharmonic Morse type oscillators that are transiently coupled by a non-
autonomous external perturbation. In terms of the action-angle variables of the two uncoupled
oscillators, we express this model resonant Hamiltonian as

This region corresponds to values of the initial action where the quasiresonance eﬀect arises,
with a low order rational value for the ratio of the changes in the actions of the unperturbed
system. Here the correlation between the variations of the actions of the two oscillators in the

(41)

Figure (3) also shows a view of the J2 −

θ2 phase plane when the coupling strength reaches
its maximum amplitude at t = tp. From the analysis of the previous section it is clear that
quasiresonance must be connected with the presence of resonance zones in the phase of the
system [6], and here we see them explicitly. Although this surface of section was generated
by examining the motion with the coupling artiﬁcially ﬁxed at the maximum value, later we
shall examine the temporal evolution in phase space under the actual transient interaction. As
did Hoving and Parson [6] for atom-diatom collisions, we ﬁnd that the region of phase space
corresponding to the values of the initial actions where a quasiresonance occurs is dominated by
a strong isolated nonlinear resonance at ﬁxed coupling. Here, we observe a large resonance zone
composed of three islands which are centered at the initial action value which gives the position
of the center of the plateau region deﬁned by the propensity rule (41).

3.1 Resonance parallelogram

Trajectories can get caught inside the limits of a growing island and thereby subject to action
transport. Thus, the parallelogram shape structure observed in ﬁgure (3) for the change in
the actions of trajectories included in a quasiresonance domain is an image of a nearly uniform
spread of the ﬁnal action values within the limits of former resonance islands, see ﬁgure (4).

3.2 How close is the action ratio to low order rationals?

The hallmark of quasiresonance is the ratio of action changes adhering to a low order rational,
reﬂective of a near (but not necessarily exact) resonance in the system phase space. How close
to the rational value are the action ratios in fact? Linear plots are of no use, since the accuracy
is typically far better than the linewidth of the plot. As ﬁgure (5) indicates, the signiﬁcant
variations in the actions for the initial conditions included in a plateau are correlated with
relatively large changes in the energy of the system. Naively, variations of similar order of
magnitude could be expected to occur in the ratio of action changes. However, even when the
resonant condition is only approximate, the quasiresonant condition M ω2 −
0 may be
satisﬁed to much higher accuracy. The energy is also not conserved (in the non-autonomous
systems) or it is exchanged between the perturber and the system (in the autonomous systems),
but the action change ratio remains rational to a high degree of accuracy, often one part in
106 for example in the present case. As seen in ﬁgure (5), the deviation of the ratio of action
changes in a plateau from a low order rational value can be several orders of magnitude below
the change in the energy or the individual actions.

N ω1 ≃

At higher energy the phase space which is accesible to the system is larger and new regions of
initial action values that satisfy diﬀerent quasiresonance conditions may appear. This is shown
in ﬁgure (6), where ﬁve regions that have signiﬁcant changes in the actions can be seen. Each

one of these regions deﬁnes a plateau in the ratio of action changes with a diﬀerent rational
value, r = N/M = 2/1, 3/2, 1/1, 2/3 and 1/2, in the propensity rule (20) that characterizes
the quasiresonance. Besides these main plateaus, a staircase structure composed of a series of
small plateaus separated by regions of transition where the ratio of actions changes dramatically
(quasiresonance is violated) is seen. As ﬁgure (6) also shows, these secondary plateaus are
associated with quasiresonances characterized by large integer values M and N in the propensity
rule (20). Although in this ﬁgure the changes in the actions at these higher order quasiresonance
domains are very small, and some of them are hardly visible, we will see below that they become
more important as the coupling between the internal degrees of freedom of the system increases,
and that they are involved in the eventual demise of the quasiresonance eﬀect.

As to be expected [6], the system with multiple quasiresonance plateaus now presents a
more complex phase space structure, see ﬁgure (7), Distinct resonance zones produce their own

zones it is possible to distinguish some long chains of tiny islands associated with the secondary
plateaus that appear in ﬁgure (6).

3.3

Interaction strength and quasiresonance

In the perturbative regime, or weak coupling limit, when the energy of the unperturbed inte-
grable system is much higher that the strength of the transient interaction, each main quasires-
onance domain remains isolated. The corresponding plateaus in the ratio of action changes are
well deﬁned and are punctuated by regions where the ratio of actions changes varies wildly. It
should be noted that in such non-quasiresonant regions an approximate adiabatic invariance of
both actions of the unperturbed system holds, but the ratio of whatever small changes do occur
is not locked at rational ratios.

As the strength of the coupling between the internal degrees of freedom of the perturbed
system increases, the main quasiresonance domains grow, and higher order nonlinear resonances
are activated in the regions between them. In the phase space, the generation of new quasires-
onance domains is reﬂected by the destruction of tori where the actions of the unperturbed
system are adiabatic invariants and the emergence of chains small islands of regular motion

The combined processes of generation of new higher order quasiresonances and the expansion
of the existing ones make the edges of neighboring quasiresonance domains to get closer and
ﬁnally come into contact. Afterwards, the overlap between diﬀerent quasiresonance domains de-
teriorates them progressively and eventually is responsible for their disappearance. Hence, the
Chirikov criterion [14] on the overlapping of neighboring resonances for the onset of chaos can
be applied to estimate the destruction of a quasiresonance domain. Once such overlap occurs,
all the invariant tori between the island of the resonance zones are destroyed and regions of
intermingled chaotic motion surrounding the islands of regular motion become visible. In the
strong coupling limit, when all the resonance zones have came into contact, nearly all the phase
space appears ﬁlled up by these stochastic regions and only some isolated islands of the former
main resonance zones may survive. Under these conditions all regions of regular quasiperiodic
motion shrink and therefore all adiabatic invariants cease to exist. This picture of the demise
of quasiresonance is approximate, however, since the timescale for the transient interaction can
attenuate the eﬀects of chaos; see Section 4.

In our model resonant Hamiltonian, the eﬀects of a stronger coupling between the two
oscillators on the quasiresonance can be analyzed taking larger amplitudes of the interaction
strength v0. As ﬁgures (8) and (9) show, the increase in v0 allows larger changes in the actions
Ji (i = 1, 2) around the resonant values. This causes an expansion of the resonances zones in
phase space and makes more visible the long chains of small islands associated with higher order
resonances. If the diﬀerent resonance zones are well separated, an increase in the size of the
corresponding quasiresonance domains might be expected. However, instead of that, ﬁgure (8)

shows is a deterioration of the rational values for the ratio of action changes. The regions of
stochastic behavior that emerge as a consequence of such overlap can be clearly observed in
ﬁgure (9).

An alternative way to change the coupling between the two oscillators s to include more
coupling terms in the transient interaction, while keeping constant its norm in the angle variables.
In this way we avoid the rapid expansion of the main resonance zones and introduce reduce the
destruction of the main quasiresonance domains. In ﬁgures (10) and (11), for example, we set
the norm as

higher order quasiresonances and the stronger overlap between neighboring domains eventually
cause their destruction. The phase space of the system presents clear manifestations of these
eﬀects, see ﬁgure (11), with an increase in the number of islands inside the main resonance zones
and the proliferation of chains of small islands associated with high-order resonances. Also thick
stochastic layers arising from the overlap of neighboring resonance zones become clearly visible.

4 Phase space mechanism of Quasiresonance

4.1 Energy dependence of the resonance condition.

The analysis of the phase space of the system has already shown the correspondence between the
location of the center of a plateau in the ratio of action changes in a quasiresonance and the center
of a nonlinear resonance zone: the center of the plateau corresponding to the propensity rule
(20) coincides with the location of the rational unperturbed torus whose independent frequencies
satisfy a resonant condition of the form (7). From now on we will denote as J N :M
i,E (i = 1, 2) the
values of the actions of the unperturbed system that give the location of this resonant torus at
energy E. That is, the solutions of the energy equation

E = H0(J)

(45)

and the resonant condition (7).

previous ﬁgures. All quantities are expressed in arbitrary units.

In the model resonant Hamiltonian introduced in the previous section, for example, the
unperturbed Hamiltonian H0 deﬁnes an integrable system in which the actions of the two un-

The four-dimensional phase space of the unperturbed system is completely stratiﬁed into two-
dimensional tori deﬁned by angle coordinates (Φ1, Φ2) and radii (J1, J2), with all periodic orbits
restricted to lie on those invariant tori whose independent frequencies satisfy a commensurate
relation. Thus, according to (38) and (7), the actions on the rational unperturbed torus N : M

whose independent frequencies satisfy a commensurate relation (7) are grossly deformed or even

Span of a quasiresonance domain

We analyze the phase space structures associated with the frozen, or constant transient interac-
tion strength limit of the Hamiltonian. Although the interaction strength is always changing in
quasiresonance, ﬁxed strength phase space plots are still useful, in particular for estimating the
span of a quasiresonance domain.

We use our model resonant Hamiltonian (37). It is convenient for our purposes to introduce

dimensionless variables. Considering the scale of time as

and introducing dimensionless action variables

describe the coupling process between the two oscillators.

We can now compare our analytical prediction for the size and shape of a primary resonance
zone with the length of the corresponding plateau in the ratio of action changes in the quasires-
onance eﬀect. Figures (16) and (17) display the quasiresonance domain associated with the
nonlinear resonance N : M = 1 : 1 for diﬀerent number m of coupling terms. As was expected,
the resonance zone presents a chain composed of mM islands, two in ﬁgure (16) and three in
ﬁgure (17), associated with the mM elliptic and mM hyperbolic ﬁxed points located at the reso-
nance action J 1:1

(τp, φ1) (k = 1, ...m) (61) when the transient interaction reachs its maximum
amplitude at τ = τp. There is good agreement between the Poincare surface of sections obtained
from the numerical simulations resonance analysis for the main resonance zones. Thus, in the
limit of weak coupling between the two oscillators (ε << 1) the expressions (63) and (64) give
a good estimate of the maximum spread of the actions across the phase space region dominated
by the main resonance N : M . Importantly, as ﬁgures (16) and (17) show, the maximum varia-

increases when the coupling between the two oscillators becomes stronger and eventually makes
all the plateau region to disappear.

4.3

Eﬀect of timescale of the transient interaction

In the previous sections we have analyzed the phase space of the frozen Hamiltonian. Now, in
order to understand the behavior of the actions when a quasiresonance occurs, we focus on the
time evolution of the system as the external transient interaction is switched on and oﬀ.

The quasiresonance eﬀect belongs to the larger class of adiabatic phenomena. If the interac-
tion turns on and oﬀ too fast, adiabaticity will be violated. The timescale is set by the nature of
the interaction potential and how often it is “visited” by the trajectory of the system, which in
turn depends on the initial actions; see Fig. 18. The period of the visitation of the interaction
potential must be much shorter than the time scale of the transient perturbation. The interac-
tion potential may be localized to one or a few small regions in both angles, (Φ1, Φ2), as it is
in an atom-diatom collision for example. Or, it may be more extended, greatly aﬀecting which
resonance zones survive to cause quasiresonance plateaus.

The longer the interaction timescale, the more high-order resonances and chaos can be
manifested; see ﬁgure (19). Thus, there is a balancing act set up between interaction time and

26

Figure 18: Trace of a slowly precessing, nearly 11:2 resonant vibrotor (compare Fig. (2)), in which the
trajectory visits each “tooth” of the gear only every other pass. If the resonance had been 11:3, it would
be every 3rd pass, etc. This makes the quasiresonance condition easier to break, since the timescale for
the transient interaction to now has to be slower by a factor of two compared to an 11:1 resonance.

the strength and form of the interaction. By keeping the transient interaction long compared
to the internal time scales associated with the low-order resonances, but short compared to
the time required to complete the long periods involved in the high-order resonances, we can
maximize the low order resonance plateaus. Similar issues are faced in the adiabatic switching
method [12].

4.4 Time evolution of the actions in a quasiresonance domain

Figure (20) shows the time evolution of an ensemble of trajectories with initial angle variables
chosen at random and four diﬀerent values of the initial action J2. The parameters used are the
same as in ﬁgure 16, which shows the phase space and action ratio. In panel (a), where the initial
action coincides with the resonance action J N :M
2,E , we observe the spread of the action values along
a series of branches corresponding to the oscillations of the trajectories around the elliptic ﬁxed
points when they remain trapped in the resonance zone. Once the transient coupling interaction
starts decreasing and the resonance zone shrinks, the actions settle on diﬀerent values around
the resonance action and a diﬀusion in action of the original ensemble is ﬁnally observed.

When the initial actions are between the center and the edges of the quasiresonance domain,
J N :M ±
J N :M
2,E,1 , see panels (b) and (c), there is a relatively smooth diﬀusion of the
2,E ≤
action until the strength of the transient interaction reachs its maximum amplitude. Afterwards
the ensembles evolve into two horizontal distributions symmetrically arranged with respect to

resonance zones is a quite general phenomenon which has been observed to play an important
role in the dynamics of systems that are perturbed by a slowly time-varying interaction; such
as the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic ﬁelds in plasma physics, the motion of
asteroids in celestial mechanics or the propagation of short radio waves in the ionosphere, see
[17] and references therein.

4.5 Phase space evolution

Phase space pictures add insight to the mechanism of action changes and quasiresonance. Figure
(21) displays the evolution in phase space of one ensemble of trajectories with initial actions
equal to the resonance action, J2i = J N :M
2,E . Hence, the phase space points of the ensemble are
already inside the oscillatory region of the resonance zone when it develops from the resonance
action J N :M
2,E . As the resonance zone grows in time the phase points cannot entirely escape from
this region, but they can cross the innermost separatrix curve, getting trapped in the internal
loops and encircling the elliptic ﬁxed points, or they can remain conﬁned in the region between
the two separatrix curves. Figures (22) and (23) include ensembles of trajectories with initial
actions between the center and the edges of the quasiresonance domain, J N :M −
2,E,1 < J2i < J N :M +
2,E,1 .
In both sequences the ensembles are initially unperturbed and therefore the action remains
nearly constant. But as the resonance zone grows, it gradually deforms the invariant tori,
J2 = J2i = const, that keep the trajectories conﬁned in phase space. Once the initial ensemble
reaches the outermost separatrix associated with the nonlinear resonance, and provided that the
resonance zone is still growing in time, some phase space points pass through the separatrix and
go into the oscillatory region of the nonlinear resonance zone, i.e. their dynamics changes from
a precession to oscillation. As in the previous sequence, once the phase points are conﬁned in
the oscillatory region they can either remain in the transition regions between two separatrix
curves or go inside the internal loops by passing through the innermost separatrix.

It is only after the resonance zone starts shrinking that the trajectories trapped in the
oscillatory region can recover the rotational dynamics by re-crossing the outermost separatrix.
Afterwards there is no way they can pass through the resonance zone again. Since the trajectories
can randomly emerge to any point inside the resonance zone, the ﬁnal eﬀect of crossing the
separatrices is the diﬀusion in action of the original ensemble around the resonance action value.
As the transient interaction goes away, the destroyed unperturbed tori, Ji = const (i = 1, 2), are
replaced by the modiﬁed invariant tori, I2 = const, that characterize the quasiresonance eﬀect.
These new invariant tori conﬁne the trajectories across the phase space region previously swept
by the separatrices of the nonlinear resonance zone. Since such region ranges from J N :M −
to
2,E,1
J N :M +
2,E,1 , the length of the quasiresonance domain, important variations of the actions may occur
after the transient interaction goes away.

As we mentioned before, the nonadiabatic eﬀects that arise in the proximity of the edges of
the quasiresonance domains are associated with the progressive approach of the trajectories in
this region to the boundary of the nonlinear resonance zone. As ﬁgure (23) shows, these are
trajectories that intersect the separatrices very close to the hyperbolic ﬁxed points, where the

evolution of the separatrix. Note the closer approach of the trajectories to the separatrix in the case of
the longer interaction time.

motion of the system becomes extremely slow, and no adiabatic invariant remains. Trajectories
with initial actions inside a well deﬁned quasiresonance domain, see ﬁgure (22), intersect the
separatrices far enough from the hyperbolic points and do not generate signiﬁcant nonadiabatic-
ity. These trajectories can go deeper into the oscillatory region of the resonance zone and fully
perform the quasiperiodic motion around the elliptic ﬁxed points that gives the quasiresonance
eﬀect. But, the more slowly the transient interaction proceeds, the more trajectories get closer
to the hyperbolic ﬁxed points when the crossings of the separatrices occur and, consequently,
the more extended across the quasiresonance domain the nonadiabaticity eﬀects manifest.

The increasing attraction of the trajectories with initial action inside the quasiresonance
domains towards the unstable ﬁxed points is clearly observed in ﬁgure (24), which shows the
evolution of two trajectories of the pendulum Hamiltonian (59) with the same initial action but
diﬀerent slowness of the transient interaction. Initially the pendulum is rotating and the angle
variable is a monotonically increasing function, but as the strength of the transient interaction
increases the rotation slows down. The more slowly the transient interaction evolves the more
the trajectory sticks to the hyperbolic ﬁxed point. When the energy of the separatrix equals
the energy of the pendulum, the trajectory crosses the separatrix and the transition to the
oscillatory regime occurs. Afterwards the pendulum starts orbiting around the elliptic ﬁxed
points describing large loops that cover an extensive region in phase space. Later, when the
strength of the transient interaction is decreasing, a new intersection of the separatrix occurs and
the pendulum recovers its rotational motion. The more slowly the transient interaction proceeds
the closer to the hyperbolic ﬁxed point the trajectory emerges from the oscillatory region. Thus,
in the limit of extremely slowly varying transient interaction, when the closest approach to

the hyperbolic ﬁxed points occurs, the outgoing trajectories from the oscillatory region of the
resonance zone asymptote to the two unstable manifolds that emanate from such points, see
ﬁgure (25). It is the evolution along such manifolds which gives the bimodal distribution in the
ﬁnal action values previously discussed.

5 Conclusions

We have shown that quasiresonance is a common eﬀect, not restricted to vibro-rotationally
inelastic collisions between an atom and a diatomic molecule, which may arise in any classical
integrable system that is perturbed by a transient interaction with additional degrees of freedom
which couples quasi (not necessarly exactly) resonant internal degrees of freedom. We have
also shown that quasiresonance eﬀects arise from either an autonomous or an explicitly time
dependent transient interaction.

The analysis of the variations of the actions and the energy of the system in a quasiresonance
domain reveals that the ratio of action changes is paramount, adhering extremely closely to a
rational ratio involving small integers, with the energy playing a secondary role.

In the limit of weak and slowly varying transient interaction, the classical adiabatic invariance
theory and the method of averaging have been used to establish the link between the presence of
a quasiresonance domain and the existence of a topologically modiﬁed adiabatic invariant that
characterizes the quasiperiodic motion of the system in the inner oscillatory region of a nonlinear
resonance zone in phase space. Within a resonance zone, the rational value in the ratio of action

34

changes that gives a quasiresonance follows immediately from the linear integer combination
that deﬁnes the modiﬁed adiabatic invariant, i.e. the action of the fast motion, in terms of the
action variables of the unperturbed system. Outside the resonance zones there is practically no
response from the system to the perturbative interaction and the adiabatic approximation is
good for both unperturbed actions, but the ratio of the tiny changes is not remarkable.

The generalized pendulum Hamiltonian obtained from the averaging over the fast motion
in the proximity of a resonance zone has provided a good model to clarify the dynamics of the
system when a quasiresonance occurs. The analysis of the phase space of such Hamiltonian
has shown that the maximum size of the phase space region swept by the innermost separatrix
of the nonlinear resonance in the course of time gives a good estimate for the length of the
corresponding quasiresonance domain. This analysis has also shown that the change in the
dynamics of the system due to the crossing of the separatrices as they move in phase space is
the mechanism involved in the signiﬁcant variations of the actions observed in a quasiresonance.
A natural extension of the work presented in this paper is the generalization of the concept of
quasiresonance to systems with more than two or three dimensions. To approach such systems,
we can return to the physical picture of the averaged Hamiltonian, and the nature of the inter-
action, where the averaging is over all fast variables which remain after identifying the slow ones
(we do not assert that this is always possible). Whenever the transient interaction timescale
(autonomous or not) is slow compared to the time between successive visits to the interaction
region, the quasiresonance concept may survive the extension to many dimensions. There may
remain more than one slow variable, in which case the nonlinear evolution will take place in the
slow variable space, perhaps preserving none of their individual actions. Nonetheless all the fast
actions would be conserved.

Another extension of this work is its connection with possible models of Arnol’d diﬀusion[13].
The picture would be of random but quasiresonant travel along resonance surfaces in action
space, interrupted by non-quasiresonant but extremely small action changes at the edges of
quasiresonant plateaus.

Abstract

Paradoxes in the Boltzmann kinetic theory are presented. Firstly, it
is pointed out that the usual notion concerning the perfect continuity of
distribution function is not generally valid; in many important situations
using certain types of discontinuous distribution functions is an absolute
must. Secondly, it is revealed that there is no time reversibility in terms
of beam-to-beam collisions and, in connection with this, there are in-
trinsic diﬃculties in formulating the net change of molecular density due
to collisions, either in the three-dimensional velocity space or in the six-
dimensional phase space. With help of simple examples, the paradoxes
manifest themselves clearly.

Introduction

When the Boltzmann equation, thought of as the ﬁrst equation of kinetic theory,
came out, many philosophical doubts arose[1], of which most were related to the
fact that while Newton’s equations themselves were time-reversible the Boltz-
mann equation, as a consequence of Newton’s equations, was time-irreversible.
As time went by, in particular after the formally rigorous BBGKY theory was
formulated in the middle of the last centrary[2−8], concerns of the time-reversal
paradox gradually faded out, and it was believed that the ultimate understand-
ing of the related issues had been completely established (at least in the regime
of classical physics).

Nevertheless, later developments of mathematics and physics have suggested
that things should be more complicated than they appear to be. As one of the
developments, the studies of fractals[9, 10] illustrate that complex structures on
very small scales resembling those on large scales exist quite generally. Impact
of the fractal studies on our customary thought can be various and enormous:
some of us may be led to think about the possibility that nature gets certain
mechanisms which allow macroscopic structures to shape and form microscopic
structures, and others may be tempted to construct new formalisms describing
dynamics of complex structures over inﬁnitely small ranges.

1

As another of the developments, it has been revealed that the standard
treatment of collisions involves essential problems and the collective behavior of
molecular collisions should be reinvestigated[11].

In this paper, we wish to present a rather comprehensive description of para-
doxical aspects of the Boltzmann equation. Firstly, it is shown that many mech-
anisms in a real gas are capable of producing abnormal molecules not associated
with continuous distribution functions; as long as macroscopic nonequilibrium
exists somewhere, sharp, even discontinuous, microscopic structures will result
elsewhere and certain types of discontinuous distribution functions need to be
employed. Secondly, it is illustrated that formulating the number of molecules
entering and leaving a volume element is a very tricky task to accomplish. Much
contrary to the customary thought, there is no time reversibility that we can
utilize. Even worse, if we want to know how many molecules enter and leave
an inﬁnitesimal phase volume element, we shall meet with conﬂicting diﬀer-
ential processes. All these paradoxes point to one thing:
it is not possible to
have a formalism that is mainly based on diﬀerential-type analyses and can still
describe kinetic dynamics in the phase space.

We shall here present only paradoxes that can be investigated from simple
and mathematical analyzes, in view of that a large number of philosophical
issues, less mathematical but not less important, have been debated rather
intensively.

2 A brief survey of the Boltzmann equation

There are many descriptions of the Boltzmann equation in the literature[12-
14]. For purposes of this paper, we shall recall the Boltzmann equation and its
derivation in a brief and illustrative way.

The core of the Boltzmann equation, which also serves as the basics of other
kinetic equations, says that if collisions of molecules of a gas can be neglected in
a certain region, the distribution function there satisﬁes the collisionless Boltz-
mann equation

∂f
∂t

+ v ·

∂f
∂r

+

F

·

∂f
∂v

= 0,

(1)

which is sometimes called the continuity equation in the phase space. The proof
of this continuity equation is obtained by considering a six-dimensional phase
volume element (box-shaped) and formulating the total ﬂux through all the
facets of the volume element. According to textbooks, this equation is also
equivalent to the path invariance of distribution function

= 0 or

f |r(t),v(t) = Constant,

(2)

where the subindexes r(t) and v(t) indicate that that the expression is valid
along a molecule’s trajectory. Conceptually speaking, equation (2) can be in-

df
dt (cid:12)
r(t),v(t)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

2

terpreted as saying that such a gas is ‘incompressible’ in the phase space. The
direct proof of the path invariance expressed by (2) is usually associated with
a Jacobian formulation. The proofs of (1) and (2) in textbooks appear to be
stringent except that there is one tacit assumption: the distribution function
is perfectly continuous (diﬀerentiable, to be more exact) in terms of the six
position and velocity components. Behind this continuity assumption, there is
a more fundamental concept called molecular chaos[14]. It is explicitly or im-
plicitly assumed that with help of molecular chaos the perfect continuity of all
interested distribution functions is virtually ensured.

To incorporate collisional eﬀects into the formalism, collisions between two
molecular beams, with velocities v1 and v2 respectively, are ﬁrst considered.
The number of type-1 molecules (with the velocity v1) leaving drdv1 during a
time interval dt is then found to be, according to the standard approach,

uf (v1)f (v2)σ(v1, v2 → v

′
1, v

2)dv2dv

where v′

tively, u = |v′
2) is the cross section
in the laboratory frame; likewise, the number of the molecules entering drdv1

(4)

In view of the conservation of molecular number, the standard approach assumes
that

σ(Ω)dΩ =

(5)

where σ(Ω) is the cross section deﬁned in the center-of-mass frame. The two
cross sections in (3) and (4) are considered to be equal to each other because of
the time-reversibility of collision. On this understanding, the net change of the
molecular number per unit phase volume and per unit time can be expressed by

u[f (v

′
1)f (v

′
2) − f (v1)f (v2)]σ(Ω)dΩdv2.

(6)

Zv2,Ω

By regarding (6) as a correction term of the collisionless Boltzmann equation,
the standard Boltzmann equation is obtained as

∂f
∂t

∂f
∂r

·

=

Zv2,Ω

[f (v

′
1)f (v

′
2) − f (v1)f (v2)]uσ(Ω)dΩdv2. (7)

The Boltzmann equation (7) is usually recognized as an independent and
complete dynamical description of a gas consisting of hard-sphere molecules.

3

The terms ‘independent’ and ‘complete’ mean that the solution for the equa-
tion can be constructed without getting help from other physical laws, such as
Newton’s equations for individual molecules. It is widely believed that if suﬃ-
ciently powerful computers were available now, we would be able to solve the
equation by applying certain types of ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes (under certain
boundary conditions and initial conditions, of course).

Although the Boltzmann equation and its derivations in textbooks seem
quite stringent and have been accepted unanimously, many paradoxes related
to it can be raised. Ironically enough, even a simple comparison between the
left and right sides provides enlightening things to ponder. On the left side,
molecules entering and leaving a six-dimensional phase volume element drdv1
have been considered and there is a good symmetry between the position vector
r and the velocity vector v1 in terms of diﬀerential operations. On the right
side, there is no symmetry between r and v1, all the integral operations are
performed in the velocity space and the position vector r serves only as an
inactive parameter. That is to say, although the derivation of the collisional
operator is formally carried out in the phase space, only the velocity subspace
has been in one’s mind.
If a forum were held in this community to discuss
which space should be used in terms of formulating the collisional operator, a
50-to-50 situation would be there: about a half of us may prefer the phase space
in view of that the left side of the Boltzmann equation is indeed written down
in the phase space, while the rest may choose the velocity space in view of that
collision issues have, almost always, been investigated in the velocity space only.
In Sect. 4 of this paper, we shall return to this subject. Much to our surprise,
it will be unveiled that, unless some of our basic concepts are changed, we shall
have intrinsic diﬃculties in formulating collisional eﬀects.

3 The continuity aspect of distribution function

Here, we wish to show that the perfect continuity of distribution function is just
an assumption; in many important situations, using certain types of discontin-
uous distribution functions is absolutely a must. Throughout this section, in
order to make the discussion less cumbersome, molecule-to-molecule collisions
are considered negligible, at least in terms of the zeroth-order approximation.

We ﬁrst establish the connection between the perfect continuity of distri-
bution function and the path invariance expressed by (2). Though the six-
dimensional phase space is somewhat abstract, we can visualize the path in-
variance in it quite easily. Fig. 1 is drawn to show the situation in the two-
dimensional x − vx phase space; but things taking place in it can schematically
manifest what happens in the full six-dimensional phase space. Suppose that
the molecules inside the rectangle in Fig. 1a distribute rather uniformly at t = 0;
these molecules will, due to molecular motion, distribute inside the parallelo-
gram in Fig. 1b rather uniformly at t = T . By excluding all external forces (to

4

make our understanding as simple as possible), we readily see that the area of
the rectangle is equal to that of the parallelogram, which means that the molec-
ular density inside the moving volume element keeps invariant. Based on the
picture outlined above, we can use a suﬃciently small phase volume element and
let it move along a molecule’s path, the average density of molecules in it will
not change, irrespective of the shape and size of the employed volume element.

Figure 2: For conﬁned molecules, the situation can be much dif-
ferent from that in Fig. 1. (a) All molecules distribute along a line
at t = 0. (b) Separations between the molecules become larger at
t = T .

However, if the molecules are conﬁned to a certain region in the phase space,
the conclusion given in the last paragraph will be valid no longer. For this to
be seen, investigate Fig. 2a, in which all the molecules distribute along one
diagonal of the rectangle at t = 0, and they will, at t = T , move to new places
and distribute along the diagonal of the parallelogram, as shown in Fig. 2b. If
we have a phase volume element of a ﬁxed size and shape and let it move with

vx

the molecules, we ﬁnd that the molecular density in it, deﬁned as the molecular
number divided by the phase volume, changes with time. Furthermore, it can
be seen that if the shape and size of the employed volume element are allowed
to change, we shall get diﬀerent molecular densities, varying drastically from
zero to inﬁnity.

A crucial question arises. Can molecules in a real gas be so conﬁned? To ﬁnd
out the answer, consider a beam of molecules striking a surface S and ‘reﬂected’
from it; or consider a surface S moving toward a group of stationary molecules
and driving them to move. As shown in Fig. 3a, if S is convex and relatively
smooth, the molecules will, after colliding with the surface, spread out in space
with deﬁnite velocities. (Even if the surface is not truly smooth, the picture
shown will not change signiﬁcantly.) By counting the molecules in a moving
spatial volume element ∆r and in a velocity range between v and v + ∆v,
we ﬁnd that the molecular density within ∆r∆v decreases. This means that
these molecules are diverging in the phase space or, in terms of the distribution
function f describing them, we get an expression as

ciated with discontinuous distributions can be constantly produced by collisions
between molecules and solid boundaries and these discontinuous distributions
will keep discontinuous along the molecular paths.

Are the diverging and converging molecules discussed in the last paragraph
important to gas dynamics? Of course, they are. If the gas in question is a really
rareﬁed one, almost all the molecules in it can be regarded as the ones produced
directly by certain boundaries, which means that before a good equilibrium is
established a great number of molecules need to be described by discontinuous
distributions. For a more practical gas, we can at least say that the regions
immediately near boundaries are very much ﬁlled with diverging and converging
molecules abnormal to the Boltzmann equation, which is suﬃcient to challenge
the standard methodologies in view of that the distributions in the inner region
(assumed to exactly obey the Boltzmann equation for the discussion herein)
has to be connected with the distributions caused by boundaries in one way or
another.

We continue searching for cases in that distribution functions are not per-
fectly continuous. In Fig. 4a, on the left side of the wall the space is ﬁlled with
a dense gas and on the right side with a dilute gas (or just a vacuum). It is
obvious that the molecules leaking through a small hole on the wall will behave
like diverging molecules in the phase space. In Fig. 4b, a gas with a very high
density is conﬁned to a small spherical ball. Suppose that the ball conﬁnement
suddenly vanishes at a moment (chosen as the initial time), and then the gas
expands almost freely. Obviously, these expanding molecules also behave like
diverging molecules. Finally, referring to Fig. 4c, consider two narrow beams
of molecules meeting with each other in a small region.
It can be seen that
the scattered molecules by the collisions there will diverge in the phase space.
The examples presented thus far tell us that molecule-to-boundary collisions,
molecule-to-molecule collisions, boundary conditions and initial conditions are
all capable of making molecules diverge or converge in the phase space.

As far as the discontinuity issue is concerned, it is quite instructive to inves-
tigate the path invariance theorem (2) more thoroughly. Though the theorem
is intimately related to the continuity assumption of distribution function, it
can, in a subtle and interesting way, lead us to betray the existing theory and
admit the necessity of using discontinuous distribution functions. To ﬁnd out

7

true implication of the path invariance, we rewrite it as, with all external forces
neglected for simplicity,

f (t, r, v) = f [t0, r0, v0)] = f [t0, r − v(t − t0), v],

(10)

where t0 is regarded as the initial time (t0 < t). Based on equation (10), we
may call r0 = r− v(t− t0) a source point and r an image point. We then assume
the distribution function at t0 to be known and try to determine the velocity
distribution at a speciﬁc point r and at a later time t, denoted by ft,r(v, Ω)
where v = |v| and the solid angle Ω speciﬁes the direction of v. From equation
(10), it is seen that for a certain value of v all the source points of ft,r(v, Ω)
distribute on the spherical shell that has the radius v(t−t0) and is centered at r.
Since v is allowed to vary from zero to inﬁnity, all points in the spatial space can
serve as the source points of ft,r(v, Ω). In other words, the path invariance says
that the velocity distribution at any spatial point is a condensed image of the
entire spatial space; or, to say it in a converse way, any local spatial structure
will constantly send its image to participate in forming the velocity distribution
at every and each point elsewhere. A direct, and somewhat surprising, corollary
of the above statements is that if a local structure is discontinuous no point in
the space is truly immune from discontinuity.

Figure 5: At each point in space, the velocity distribution is
formed as an image of structures elsewhere. The stuctures can
be (a) a solid block surrounded by a gas; (b) a continuous gas
with density gradient.

Making things worse, even a continuous distribution can constantly send
‘bad images’ to other places. Let’s compare between Fig. 5a and Fig.5b. In
Fig. 5a, there is a solid block surrounded by a continuous gas. The velocity
distributions at other points, as images of the block and the gas, must involve
corresponding discontinuity, as analyzed in the last paragraph. We then turn
to Fig. 5b and assume that the distribution function in the oval region can be
expressed by a local Maxwellian n(r) exp(−mv2/2T ), where the temperature T
is constant and the symbol n(r) represents that the density there has a certain
spatial gradient (but still perfectly contitinuous). From (10), we ﬁnd that the

sharpness of the velocity distribution at an image point r outside the region can
be characterized by

/(2T ),

(cid:12)

r

where r1 and r2 are two source points in the oval region and θ is the angle formed
by the two paths r−r1 and r−r2 (both are straight lines with no external force).
This expression informs us that as the image point r goes farther and farther
away from the region (while holding r1 and r2 ﬁxed), the proﬁle of velocity
distribution will have a sharper and sharper gradient in terms of the velocity
angles and, ﬁnally, get almost the same shape as that caused discontinuous
source structures. For convenience of discussion, we shall say that the veloc-
ity distributions illustrated in Fig. 5b are those involving quasi-discontinuity,
though similar phenomena have been studied in mathematics under the title
‘nonuniform continuity’[15].

The last two paragraphs manifest several interesting characteristics of gas
dynamics. (i) Macroscopic structures constantly send their images (structure
information) to shape and form microscopic structures elsewhere. (ii) When
the structure information is conveyed through space it is condensed and sharp-
ened progressively. (iii) Since a local distribution is a condensed image of its
surrounding environment, it is improper and unnecessary to endow distribution
functions with special continuity properties. (iv) Physical events make their in-
ﬂuences through one-dimensional trajectories, which is described by collisionless
Newton’s equations or Hamilton’s equations.

We now wish to examine the discontinuous distribution function produced
by a boundary of ﬁnite size in an analytical manner. Experimental facts tell
us that collisions between molecules and boundaries cannot be truly elastic;
stochastic and dissipative forces must get involved to a certain degree[1][16]. To
describe molecules ‘emitted’ by such boundaries, it is adequate, in particular
for a rareﬁed gas, to deﬁne the local emission rate σ in such a way that

σdtdSdvdΩ

(12)

represents the number of molecules that are reﬂected by the surface element dS
and emerge in the speed range dv and in the solid angle range dΩ during the
time interval dt. Referring Fig. 3 and dividing S there into N elements, we ﬁnd
that for the ith element of S the reﬂected molecules are like ones emitted from a
point source and the corresponding distribution function at a point r elsewhere
can be expressed by, with external forces neglected,

f (r, v, Ω) =

σ(∆S)i
|r − r0i|2v3 Vi(v)δ(Ω − Ωr−r0i ),

(13)

where Ω stands for a solid angle in the velocity space at r, Vi(v) is a function of v,
r0i is the position vector of (∆S)i and the solid angle Ωr−r0i takes the direction

9

in that a reﬂected molecule will continue to move from r after passing through its
trajectory r0i → r. Since external forces are ignored, Ωr−r0i simply points in the
direction of r − r0i. In terms of r and v, this distribution function is continuous;
in terms of Ω, it is conﬁned to a certain ‘point’ Ωr−r0i . In this sense, we wish
to say that the distribution function (13) is a function of four dimensions. The
distribution function at r associated with all reﬂected molecules from all the
area elements is

f (r, v, Ω) =

N

Xi

σ(∆S)i
|r − r0i|2v3 Vi(v)δ(Ω − Ωr−r0i).

(14)

Note that, on the usual understanding of distribution function, the summation
symbol in (14) is a formal one and we cannot replace it with the integral sign
since each of Ωr−r0i represents a distinctive direction. Fig. 3 has shown that
the molecules related to (14) can diverge or converge in the phase space, mainly
depending on how S is arranged. As a limiting case, if S is suﬃciently small,
equation (14), being identical to (13), represents diverging molecules.

Though the above discussion appears to be trivial, many new concepts can
arise from it. As one thing, allowing δ-functions to express distribution functions
shakes the prevailing belief that distribution functions must be continuous and
gas dynamics must be analyzed by diﬀerential equations. As another, with the
use of such δ-functions, path information of molecules (which is described by
collisionless Newton’s equations or Hamilton’s equations) enters into the picture
in a natural and treatable way. Finally, in order to relate this type of distribution
function to the usual type of distribution function, we are actually compelled
to invoke integral-type formulations.

Before ﬁnishing this subject, one issue may come into our mind. In ﬂuid
mechanics, several types of discontinuity, such as those related to shock waves,
have been treated by ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes in a fairly successful way, why
should we give so much concern to discontinuity in the kinetic regime? There are
a number of things that can justify our attitude. Firstly, unlike what happens
in ﬂuid mechanics, discontinuities discussed in this paper spread out and involve
almost all points in space. Secondly, we have seen that the quasi-discontinuity
produced by distribution functions will become sharper and sharper when prop-
agating, and this type of dynamics cannot be dealt with by ﬁnite diﬀerence
schemes. Finally, all types of discontinuity presented in this section transfer
along molecular paths, suggesting that path information must play a vital role
in the would-be formalism, whereas path information is disregarded in almost all
ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes of solving the Boltzmann equation (see the discussion
in Sect. 2 also).

4 The collision aspect of the Boltzmann equa-

tion

The collisional operator of the Boltzmann equation seems to have been ‘clearly
elaborated’ in many textbooks. However, as will be seen, these elaborations
actually involve vague descriptions and tacit assumptions. If we look at them
with a mind less preoccupied, paradoxical concepts hidden in them will unveil
themselves.

Figure 6: Schematic of the time reversibility of two individual
molecules. (a) The original collision; and (b) the inverse collision.

To begin with, we recall the usual description of time reversal for a collision
of two molecules with the same mass (still distinguishable according to classical
mechanics). The initial and ﬁnal velocities of the ﬁrst molecule are denoted by
v1 and v′
1 respectively; the initial and ﬁnal velocities of the second molecule by
v2 and v′
2 respectively. The following two collisions, referring to Fig. 6,

v1, v2 → v

′
′
1, v

and − v

′
1, −v

2 → −v1, −v2

(15)

can be deemed as a pair of corresponding collisions. Under this understanding,
the time reversibility of collision implies that if the ﬁrst collision of the pair is
physically possible then the second one must also be physically possible. This
type of time reversibility has been solidly established in classical mechanics and
we shall discuss it no more.

Now, we try to investigate whether or not there is time reversibility in terms
of collisions between two molecular beams. Apparently, to the Boltzmann equa-
tion a time reversibility of this type is much more relevant. In what follows,
it will be shown that, much contrary to the conventional wisdom, no time re-
versibility of this type can be found out: neither an intuitive one, nor a mathe-
matical one.

Intuitively, we may consider the following pair of corresponding pictures as
a ‘candidate’ for such time reversibility. The original collision picture is that
two molecular beams with deﬁnite velocities collide with each other and the
molecules scattered by collisions diverge in the spatial space with many diﬀer-
ent velocities, as shown in Fig. 7a. The inverse collision picture is that many
diﬀerent converging beams collide with each other and the molecules scattered

11

by collisions form two molecular beams with two deﬁnite velocities, as shown in
Fig. 7b. In no need of much discussion, we all know that the ﬁrst picture makes
sense in statistical mechanics, while the second one does not.

Mathematically, according to the textbook treatment[12], the time reversibil-

ity of beam-to-beam collision can be expressed by

σ(v1, v2 → v

2) = σ(v
where the cross section σ(v1, v2 → v′
1, v′

v2,

An unfortunate fact is that the concepts related to (16) and (17) suﬀer from
fatal problems. For the collisions, the energy and momentum conservation laws
state that

where c is the velocity of the center-of-mass and u is the relative speed of
the two molecules. Fig. 8a shows how we can get c and u from the initial
velocities v1 and v2, while Fig. 8b shows how c and u form constraints on the
ﬁnal velocities v′
2. It is clear that the ﬁnal velocities of all scattered
molecules must fall on a spherical shell S of diameter u = |u| in the velocity
space, which will be called the accessible shell. Keeping this accessible shell in
mind, two misconcepts connected with the deﬁnition (17) manifest themselves.

The ﬁrst is that after dv′

reference to a velocity volume element (like dv′
1 in the deﬁnition). If we insist on
doing so, the resultant cross section will unpleasantly vary from zero to inﬁnity,
depending on the shape and size of the employed velocity volume element.

Figure 9: Possible velocity volume elements dv′
1 are given, each
of which encloses a small part of the accessible surface S. They
can be (a) a spherical ball, (b) a slim cylinder, and (c) a tabular
cylinder.

To see the conclusion given in the last paragraph more vividly, look at Fig. 9,
in which several possible shapes have been given to dv′
1. For the situation shown
in Fig. 9a, the number of molecules entering the spherical ball, chosen to be
dv′
1, per unit time can be expressed by N ≈ ρπr2, where ρ is the area density
of molecules on the accessible shell caused by unit ﬂux of type-1 molecules and
r is the radius of the spherical ball dv′
1. By noting that ρ must be ﬁnite, we
ﬁnd that the cross section deﬁned by (17) is equal to, with dv′

2 neglected,

σ =

N
dv′
1

=

ρπr2
4πr3/3

=

3ρ
4r

,

13

(19)

and it tends to inﬁnity as r → 0. Nevertheless, if the volume element dv′
1 is
chosen to be the one in Fig. 9b, then σ tends to zero; if the volume element dv′
1
is chosen to be the one in Fig. 9c, σ tends to inﬁnity again. These examples
simply mean that the cross section deﬁned by (17) is, in fact, an ill-deﬁned
quantity, and thus the time reversibility (16) deﬁned by such cross sections is
also groundless.

It is now clear that the Boltzmann collisional operator indeed involves mis-
concepts. An interesting and essential question arises: Can we still formulate
collisional eﬀects in the context of the standard theory? In the rest of this
section we try to get an answer to this question by reinvestigating collisional
eﬀects in the three-dimensional velocity space and in the six-dimensional phase
space. Surprisingly enough, such investigations will give us nothing but more
paradoxes.

Let’s ﬁrst investigate the number of the molecules that enter a volume ele-
ment in a velocity space, denoted by dv1 herein. This type of investigation is
not truly relevant, since the Boltzmann equation is supposed to be cast in the
full six-dimensional phase space, but we take this approach anyway, in order
to see where we arrive at. Following the usual methodology, we consider two
molecular beams with velocities v′
1 and v′
2 (called type-1 and type-2 molecules
respectively), and examine how many type-1 molecules emerge, after collisions,
in the range between v1 and v1 + dv1. As the discussion after (18) has already
manifested, because of the energy and momentum conservation laws, all the
type-1 molecules scattered by collisions must fall on the accessible shell. If we
insist on knowing the density of the molecules entering the volume element dv1,
we get a result that varies drastically from zero to inﬁnity, depending on the
position, size and shape of dv1.

We now turn our attention from the velocity space to the phase space and try
to examine the net change of the molecular number in a six-dimensional phase
volume element due to collisions. For the reason that has been clariﬁed, the
following examination will be done without getting help from the cross section
σ(v1, v2 → v′

1, v′

2).

Firstly, the molecules leaving drdv1 during dt due to collisions are of our
concern. Rather conventionally, we identify f (v1)dv1 and f (v2)dv2 as two
molecular beams. By switching to the center-of-mass frame and studying the
collisions related to the two beams, the number of the collisions in dr during dt
can be directly obtained as

dtdr

dΩuσ(Ω)[f (v1)dv1][f (v2)dv2],

(20)

ZΩ

where σ(Ω) is well-deﬁned in the center-of-mass frame[17]. Integrating the above
formula over v2 yields the total number of the collisions taking place in drdv1
during dt

dtdrdv1 ZΩ,v2

uf (v1)f (v2)σ(Ω)dΩdv2.

(21)

14

Until now, every step is almost the same as that in the standard approach, and
the comparison between this expression and the Boltzmann collisional operator
seems to state that things go and will go as smoothly as expected. However, a
careful inspection will tell us diﬀerent stories. The form of dtdrdv1 in expres-
sion (21) reminds us that dt, dr and dv1 are three diﬀerentials; in obtaining
the Boltzmann equation, each of them must be allowed to approach zero inde-
pendently. Conﬂicting conclusions will be drawn when diﬀerent ways of taking
if |dr| >> |v1dt|,
these limits are adopted. One of the conclusions is that:
where |dr| stands for the length scale of dr, almost all the molecules not suﬀer-
ing collisions will stay inside drdv1 during dt and the molecules expressed by
(21) are indeed the ones that get velocity changes due to collisions and leave
drdv1 during dt. But, another conclusion is quite opposite: if |dr| << |v1dt|, all
the molecules initially inside drdv1 will get out of drdv1 in a time much shorter
than dt, irrespective of suﬀering collisions or not (see Fig. 10a). In the latter
case, it is meaningless to say that the molecules described by (21) are those
leaving the volume element during dt just due to collisions. In other words, to
make (21) relevant, we have no choice but to assume that |dr| >> |v1dt|. An
unfortunate fact is that no sound reason can be found out for that we can prefer
this assumption to its converse.

drdv1 during dt. (a) If |dr| << |v1dt| all molecules will leave dr
almost instantly. (b) If |dr| << |v1dt| most of molecules produced
by collisions will not stay within dr after dt.

Then, we examine molecules entering a phase volume element drdv1 during
dt due to collisions. Following the textbook treatment, two beams with velocities
v′
1 and v′
2 are assumed to collide within a spatial volume element dr during dt,
giving contribution to the molecules expressed by f (r, v1, t)drdv1. Since no time
reversibility can be utilized as a ‘shortcut’, we have to try the task from scratch.
It turns out that not one but many paradoxes will be in front of us. As the ﬁrst
paradox, if we assume, by adopting the customary thought, that only collisions
taking place within dr are worth considering, then the size and shape of dr will

15

become irrelevant and the six-dimensional collision issue will be reduced to the
three-dimensional collision issue in the velocity space. As have already been
discussed, the number of the molecules entering a three-dimensional velocity
volume element is an ill-deﬁned quantity and we have no way to determine it
deﬁnitely. As the second paradox, even if we were able to formulate the relevant
molecular number produced by collisions within drdv1 during dt, we would still
encounter serious diﬃculties. For instance, we again need to let dt, dr and
If |dr| << |v1dt|, all produced molecules will ‘instantly’
dv1 approach zero.
leave drdv1 (see Fig. 10b) and cannot be treated as a true contribution to
f (r, v1, t)drdv1. As the third paradox, molecules produced by local collisions
must diverge in the phase space, as revealed in the last section; such molecules
have to be treated with care and cannot be regarded as a regular contribution
to f (r, v1, t)drdv1.

The discussions in this section, as well as some of those in the last section,
suggest one essential and delicate thing: the phase space is a space much more
complex than it appears and the collective behavior of molecules in it has to be
studied in a careful and comprehensive way. The phase space, in which x, y, z
and px, py, pz are regarded as variables independent of each other, has been em-
ployed for many years and has served as a good mental and mathematical tool in
classical mechanics. Its success is actually related to the existence of Hamilton’s
equations. With help of Hamilton’s equations, the true correlation between t, r
and v will be restored when the solution of Hamilton’s equations is obtained. In
statistical mechanics, the situation is subtly diﬀerent. As has been illustrated
in this section, to formulate collisional dynamics, it is sometimes necessary to
consider the correlation between t, r and v and sometimes not necessary to do
so. Before and after collisions, the molecules obey Hamilton’s equations for
individual molecules, in which dt, dr and dv indeed correlate. When collisions
take place, the molecules are governed by laws of beam-to-beam collisions, in
which certain types of statistical assumptions have to be adopted and Hamil-
ton’s equations for individual molecules do not play an essential role. Though
the standard collisional operator tries hard to combine these two mechanisms,
some conﬂicts remain there.

5 Conclusions

In summary, two paradoxical aspects of the standard Boltzmann equation have
been presented. The ﬁrst paradoxical aspect is related to the usual concept
of distribution function. An tacit assumption of the existing kinetic equations
is that distribution functions, though describing discrete molecules, must be
mentally and practically continuous. The discussions in this paper, however,
show that distribution functions of realistic gases can have complex structures
over inﬁnitesimal range, and such distribution functions do not keep invariant
along a molecule’s path even if the local collisions can be ignored. The second

16

paradoxical aspect is related to the standard collisional operator. It is pointed
out that the time reversibility in terms of beam-to-beam collisions is actually
ﬁctitious. Along this line, it is unveiled that there are unsurmountable diﬃ-
culties in terms of formulating molecules entering and leaving an inﬁnitesimal
phase volume element. All these things pinpoint one thing in common: it is not
possible to formulate collective behavior of molecules in the phase space mainly
based on a diﬀerential-type analysis.

Many more fundamental questions arise sharply. Some of our recent works
try to make more analyses and put forward alternative approaches[18, 19]. With
help of a development in quantum mechanics[20], part of the discussion in this
paper can be extended to the regime of quantum statistical physics.

VECTOR CIRCUIT THEORY FOR SPATIALLY DISPERSIVE

Abstract—We present a general dyadic vector circuit formalism, applicable for
uniaxial magneto-dielectric slabs, with strong spatial dispersion explicitly taken into
account. This formalism extends the vector circuit theory, previously introduced
only for isotropic and chiral slabs. Here we assume that the problem geometry
imposes strong spatial dispersion only in the plane, parallel to the slab interfaces.
The diﬀerence arising from taking into account spatial dispersion along the
normal to the interface is brieﬂy discussed. We derive general dyadic impedance
and admittance matrices, and calculate corresponding transmission and reﬂection
coeﬃcients for arbitrary plane wave incidence. As a practical example, we consider a
metamaterial slab built of conducting wires and split-ring resonators, and show that
neglecting spatial dispersion and uniaxial nature in this structure leads to dramatic
errors in calculation of transmission characteristics.

1. INTRODUCTION

It is well known that many problems dealing with reﬂections from multilayered
media can be solved using the transmission line analogy when the eigen-polarizations
are studied separately (see e.g. [1]).
In this case, the amplitudes of tangential
electric and magnetic ﬁelds are treated as equivalent scalar voltages and currents
in the equivalent transmission line section.
In order to account for an arbitrary
polarization, Lindell and Alanen introduced a vector transmission-line analogy [2],
where vector tangential electric and magnetic ﬁelds serve as equivalent voltage
and current quantities. Later on, the vector transmission-line analogy was further
extended for isotropic and chiral slabs into a vector circuit formalism, with the slabs
represented as two-port circuits with equivalent impedances and admittances [3, 4].

This vector circuit theory has been successfully applied to study plane wave reﬂection
from chiral slabs [5], and extended to uniaxial multilayer structures [6].

in particular,

Recent emergence of metamaterials and the subsequent growth of research
interest to their properties, revitalized the importance of analytical methods for
studying artiﬁcial media,
for proper calculation of the reﬂection
and transmission properties. The most prominent examples of metamaterials [7]
involve split-ring resonators [8] interlayered with a wire structure, being organized
in an essentially anisotropic manner (e.g.,
like shown in Fig. 1a). Eﬀective
permittivity (permeability) tensors in such metamaterials correspond to those of
uniaxial dielectric (magnetic) crystals, and the principal values of both tensors diﬀer
from unity along one direction only. Moreover, the presence of wire medium imposes
signiﬁcant spatial dispersion for all waves with an electric ﬁeld component along the
wires [9].

These peculiarities drive the properties of such metamaterials far apart from
what can be described in terms of the isotropic vector circuit theory, and raise a
clear demand for an appropriate generalization. The corresponding theory extension
is the main objective of this paper.

2. TRANSMISSION MATRIX

Let us consider a spatially dispersive slab having thickness d and characterized by
the following material parameter dyadics (Fig. 1b)

ǫ = ǫt(kt)I t + ǫnnn, µ = µtI t + µnnn,

(1)

where n is the unit normal vector for the slab and I t = I − nn is the transversal unit
dyadic. We consider plane wave excitation and move from the physical space to the

sides of the slab, respectively.

Fourier space by a transformation ∇t → −jkt. For plane waves, kt simply stands
for the transversal propagation factor. Physically we could as well assume that the
slab is illuminated by a source located electrically far away from the slab. Notation
ǫ(kt) stresses the spatially dispersive nature of the slab in the tangential plane,
and indicates the dependence of the permittivity component from the tangential
propagation factor.

Starting from the Maxwell equations the following set of equations can be

We immediately notice that if the slab is local and isotropic, coeﬃcients (23)–(25)
reduce to those obtained earlier for an isotropic slab [3].

The exact boundary condition for a slab on a metal ground plane follows directly

written as two equations in the following form:

5. PRACTICALLY REALIZABLE SLABS

A typical example which ﬁts into the general model presented above, is a slab of
metamaterial, implemented as an array of conducting wires and split rings resonators
(WM–SRR structure), Fig 1a. The wires are assumed to be inﬁnitely long in the
y-direction. Moreover, the number of wires in the x-direction, and the number of
split-ring resonators both in the x- and y-directions is assumed to be inﬁnite.
For the case shown in Fig. 1a the non-local permittivity dyadic reads [9]

ǫ = ǫxuxux + ǫyuyuy + ǫzuzuz,

ǫx = ǫz = ǫh,

ǫy = ǫh

y !

 

where ǫh is the permittivity of the host matrix, kp is the plasma wave number, k
is the wave number of the host medium, and ky is the y-component of the wave
vector inside the lattice. Generalization of the dyadic for a case when the wires are
perodically arranged along two directions (double-wire medium with non-connected
wires [10]) is straightforward.

A commonly accepted permeability model as an eﬀective medium description of
dense (in terms of the wavelength) arrays of split-ring resonators (SRRs) and other
similar structures reads (see e.g. [11, 12, 13])

where µh is the permeability of the host medium, Λ is the amplitude factor
(0 < Λ < 1), ω0 is the undamped angular frequency of the zeroth pole pair (the
resonant frequency of the array), and Γ is the loss factor. These parameters can be
theoretically estimated for any particular case [12]. When the SRRs are positioned
to the locations where the quasi-static magnetic ﬁeld produced by the wires is
zero (to the symmetry planes), there is no near ﬁeld coupling between the two
fractions [14] and the whole metamaterial can be characterized by the permittivity
and permeability in the form above.

The derivation presented above holds for the WM–SRR structure only when
the wires are parallel to the slab interfaces and the tangential propagation factor is
restricted to the interval 0 ≤ kt < k. In this case a plane wave incident on the slab
excites only TM and TE wave. If the slab is excited by a source, located close to
the surface, or the source is inside the slab, an additional TEM wave will be excited
by the source, [9]. The same happens for an incident plane wave, if kt = k. Note
that, when the wires are perpendicular to the interface diﬀerent approach is needed.
Recently, authors of [15] considered a slab with wires perpendicular to the interfaces
and presented another method to calculate the transmission coeﬃcient for such a
slab.

6. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES

Here we present some calculated results for plane wave transmission through the
WM-SRR slab in Fig. 1b. We compare the transmission coeﬃcient calculated when
the slab is assumed to be uniaxial and non-local with the transmission coeﬃcient
obtained when: (i) the slab is assumed to be uniaxial but local, or (ii) the slab
is assumed to be isotropic and local. Local model for the permittivity means that
ky = 0 in (40). Next, we study the angular dependence of the transmission coeﬃcient
at certain frequencies when the eﬀective refractive index of the slab is close to zero.
For simplicity, only an example of TM polarization is considered.

For this analysis we assume the following parameters: slab thickness d = 150
mm, ǫh = ǫ0, and kp = 104.7 m−1 (the corresponding plasma frequency is fp = 5
GHz); µh = µ0, Λ = 0.4, ω0 = 2π · 2.5 GHz, Γ = ω0/50. The permittivity and
permeability dyadics are calculated in accordance with equations (39)–(40) and (41)–
(42), respectively.

Fig. 3 compares the exact transmission coeﬃcient to the transmission coeﬃcient
calculated when the slab is assumed to be local [case (i)]. Only for the normal
incidence (not plotted) the results are the same. At small incidence angles (e.g. θ =
π/6) there is a transmission maximum around 3 GHz. This maximum corresponds
to the frequency range where both Re{ǫ} and Re{µ} are negative and relatively
close to unity in magnitude. In this situation a planar slab can bring a point source
to a focus without spherical aberration [16]. In a certain frequency above 3 GHz
Re{µ} becomes positive while Re{ǫ} remains negative, leading to a stop-band. At
frequency f = fp permittivity becomes positive and waves can propagate through
the slab. Note that when the permittivity is assumed to be non-local the position of
the pass-band edge is predicted at remarkably higher frequencies compared to the
local model.

For larger incidence angles (e.g. θ = π/3) the maxima around 3 GHz disappear
and the transmission coeﬃcient obeys an increasing behavior starting at f0 (the
resonant frequency for µt). Indeed, eq. (12) for βTM shows that the term Re{k2
0(µt −
sin2 θ)} is negative at frequencies f > f0. Thus, a pass-band will appear in the
frequency interval f0 < f < fp because in this interval also Re{ǫ} is negative.

Fig. 4 compares the exact transmission coeﬃcient to the transmission coeﬃcient
calculated when the slab is assumed to be local and isotropic [case (ii)]. Clearly the

assumption that the slab is isotropic and local leads to severe errors except for the
normal incidence.

For an additional

illustration we study the angular dependence of the
transmission coeﬃcient at certain frequencies when the eﬀective refractive index
n of the slab is close to zero while Re{µt} > 0 ∧ Re{µt} 6= µ0, and Re{ǫt} > 0 ∧
Re{ǫt} 6= ǫ0. Comparison is made between the results given by the non-local and
local models (in both models the slab is assumed to be uniaxial). An interest to this
problem arises from recent suggestions for microwave applications beneﬁting from
slabs having low value for both Re{µ} and Re{ǫ} [17].

In practise the condition n ≈ 0, Re{µt} > 0 ∧ Re{ǫt} > 0 occurs at frequencies
slightly above fp. We have to bear in mind, however, the physical limitation of the
permeability model (42): the model is valid at low frequencies and at frequencies
relatively close to the magnetic resonance. Here we assume that in the vicinity of
fp the permeability model is still valid. The transmission coeﬃcients are depicted
in Fig. 6. It shows that transmission maxima, covering a wide range of angles from
50 to 80 degrees appear when the non-local model is used. These maxima are not
predicted when the local permittivity model is used. This behavior can be explained
by considering the z-component of the propagation factor, which in this case can be
written in the following form:

(43)

In order for a wave to propagate through the slab, both terms inside the parentheses
[the right side of eq. (43)] must be simultaneously positive or negative. For small
incidence angles both are positive and for large angles both are negative. In a certain
range of angles, however, these terms are of opposite sign, leading to a stop-band.

Eﬀectively condition n ≈ 0 can also be achieved in photonic crystals in the
vicinity of the stop-band edge, e.g. [18, 19, 20]. This feature is reported to be
important for practical applications (e.g. [21]). Accordingly, we can apply the
developed method to study the transmission characteristics of the slab only in the
presence of wires. Fig. 5 shows the calculated results (note the range of incidence
angles). The transmission maxima seen at certain angles correspond to thickness
resonances of the slab. The results indicate that the slab can be utilized as an
eﬀective angular ﬁlter at microwave frequencies. Note that when the permittivity
is assumed to be local, some maxima are also seen in the transmission coeﬃcient,
however, the location of these maxima is incorrectly predicted.

7. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have formulated a vector circuit representation for spatially
dispersive uniaxial magneto-dielectric slabs. A dyadic transmission matrix and the
corresponding impedance and admittance matrices have been derived. The results
take into account spatial dispersion along the planes parallel to the slab interfaces.
The presented results allow the exact calculation of the transmission and
reﬂection coeﬃcient for a plane wave with arbitrary incidence angles. This model
is applicable, for example, to a typical metamaterial implemented as a lattice of

in the wire media must be taken into account. The calculated results also indicate
the feasibility of the slab to operate as an eﬀective angular ﬁlter at microwave
frequencies.

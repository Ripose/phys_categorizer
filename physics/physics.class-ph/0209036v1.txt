Abstract

The propagation of light-pulse with negative group-velocity in a nonlinear medium
is studied theoretically. We show that the necessary conditions for these eﬀects to be
observable are realized in a three-level Λ-system interacting with a linearly polarized laser
beam in the presence of a static magnetic ﬁeld. In low power regime, when all other non-
linear processes are negligible, the light-induced Zeeman coherence cancels the resonant
absorption of the medium almost completely, but preserves the dispersion anomalous and
very high. As a result, a superluminal light pulse propagation can be observed in the sense
that the peak of the transmitted pulse exits the medium before the peak of the incident
pulse enters. There is no violation of causality and energy conservation. Moreover, the
superluminal eﬀects are prominently manifested in the reshaping of pulse, which is caused
by the intensity-dependent pulse velocity. Unlike the shock wave formation in a nonlinear
medium with normal dispersion, here, the self-steepening of the pulse trailing edge takes
place due to the fact that the more intense parts of the pulse travel slower. The pre-
dicted eﬀect can be easily observed in the well known schemes employed for studying of
nonlinear magneto-optical rotation. The upper bound of sample length is found from the
criterion that the pulse self-steepening and group-advance time are observable without
pulse distortion caused by the group-velocity dispersion.

1 Introduction

The propagation of light pulses through the media with a normal dispersion is adequately
described by the group velocity, which in this case turns out to be, in fact, the velocity of
signal transfer. However, the group velocity loses its role of signal velocity in the region of
anomalous dispersion, where it not only exceeds the vacuum speed of light, but at certain
frequencies becomes negative, whereas, even when the group velocity is superluminal, no real
signal can be transferred faster than the vacuum velocity of light [1]. Nevertheless, contrary to
the common assertion [2, 3] that superluminal group velocity is not a useful concept, Garrett and
McCumber [4] have shown that in the case of superluminal propagation of suﬃciently smooth

pulses, such as Gaussian wave packets,the motion of the pulse peak is correctly described by
the classical expression of group velocity. The eﬀect of superluminality is that the emerging
pulse has essentially the same shape and width as that of the incident wave packet, but its
peak exits the cell before the incident pulse even enters. This process can be understood in
terms of superposition and interference of traveling plane waves that have a distribution of
frequencies and add up to form a narrow-band light pulse. In a dispersive medium the speed of
each plane wave is determined by the refractive index at that frequency. Around the resonance
in the region of anomalous dispersion the refractive index varies so steeply and diﬀerent plane
waves interfere in a way that the point of maximal constructive interference is localized at the
exit face of the sample. The plane waves appear in the medium much earlier and, hence, the
exit pulse is formed long before than the peak of incident pulse enters the medium. When the
group velocity is negative the exit pulse splits into two pulses, one of which moves forward in
the vacuum, while the second one propagates backward in the medium and is canceled by the
incoming pulse at the entrance of the cell (see Sec. 3).The superluminal propagation can be
phenomenologically represented as reshaping of the pulse, most of which is absorbed, leaving
only a small pulse in the leading edge. Eventually, the outgoing pulse moves superluminally
and saves the shape of initial pulse. This picture breaks down, if the envelope of incident wave
packet has singularities, for example, step-type modulations, that always moves with the light
velocity c. All these results demonstrate that for smooth pulses with continuous derivatives the
group velocity is physically meaningful even when it is negative. But it cannot be interpreted
as a velocity of real signal, which could propagate no faster than light [5]. These predictions
have been conﬁrmed experimentally using various schemes, including the anomalous dispersion
near an absorption line [6, 7], nonlinear gain [8], active plasma medium [9] and the tunneling
of one-photon wave packet through a barrier [10].

An interesting model for a transparent anomalous dispersive medium and a light pulse
propagation with negative group velocity has been proposed by Chiao and co-workers [11, 12].
The model is based on the destructive interference between the two close-lying gain transitions.
In this scheme L.Wang and co-workers have recently observed a pulse-advance shift of 62ns in
cesium vapor [13].

The results of papers [4]-[8], [10]-[14] are based on linear response of the medium where
the negative group velocity always exists within the absorption lines [1] and outside gain lines
[11]-[14]. The similar results have been obtained, when a weak probe beam propagates with
an eﬀective index of refraction induced by a nonlinear interaction of the medium with a strong
pump ﬁeld. Under these conditions both the probe light ultraslow propagation [15]-[17] at the
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) [18] and the negative ”group-delay” propaga-
tion associated with electromagnetically induced opacity [19, 20] have been recently observed
experimentally. However, from the point of view of the dependence of optical properties of
medium on probe ﬁeld intensity these systems may be clearly considered as eﬀectively linear
optical media with an extraordinary large dispersion.

Intriguing questions arise whether the nonlinear superluminality occurs in a medium, the
refractive index of which is modiﬁed by the propagating light pulse. How this eﬀect is pro-
nounced, and what is the form of superluminal pulse emerging from such a nonlinear medium?
It seemed, that the answer to these questions could be easily obtained in a two-level atom,
which is a basic model for the study of superluminal propagation in linear media [4]-[8],[10].
Notice that this system has been also employed for investigation of nonlinear slow optical pulse
propagation in media with normal dispersion [21, 22]. However, a two-state system is unﬁt
for observation of nonlinear superluminal eﬀects. The problem is to observe the pulse super-
luminal propagation in a medium with an intensity-dependent refractive index, but without

accompanying nonlinear processes, which lead to pulse reshaping as well. Since a two-level
atom displays anomalous dispersion within the absorption line and the nonlinearity in the dis-
persion is achieved at the intensities that are much larger than the saturation intensity (see
Appendix), nonlinear eﬀects such as self-focusing (or defocusing), self-phase modulation etc.,
cannot be neglected. Meanwhile, the systems, that are almost transparent and at the same
time show large nonlinear dispersion, have been basic models for theoretical and experimental
studies of resonant nonlinear magneto-optical eﬀects caused by a laser-induced coherence (see
the recent review by Budker et al. [23]). The simplest system displaying these properties is a
three-level Λ-atom with ground-state Zeeman sublevels, that interacts with the right (RCP)
and left (LCP) circularly polarized components of optical light-pulse in the presence of weak
magnetic ﬁeld, which is applied along the direction of light pulse propagation (Fig.1). Due to
the nearly maximal Zeeman coherence, large nonlinear susceptibilities are created at the reso-
nance frequency in analogous to those observed in EIT experiments (for relationship between
EIT and nonlinear magneto-optics see [17]). This leads to very narrow magnetic resonances [24]
or enhances signiﬁcantly the nonlinear Faraday signal [25]. However, the dynamics of resonant
light propagation in coherent nonlinear media has not been studied yet. This analysis is carried
out for the ﬁrst time in the present paper. For the Faraday conﬁguration in Fig.1 we show that
the light-induced Zeeman coherence preserves the anomalous dispersion of the medium, while
it suppresses the absorption at the resonance line center. This results in a negative nonlinear
group-velocity at the values of light intensity, that are many times smaller than the saturation
intensity of the corresponding atomic transition. In this scheme the superluminal eﬀects are
revealed in two ways. Firstly, similar to linear media, the peak of outgoing pulse exits the cell
before the peak of incident pulse with a narrow spectral width enters the medium. Secondly,
the pulse velocity is nonlinear in light intensity, the more intense parts of the pulse travel
slower. As a result, the self-steepening of the trailing edge of pulse takes place in contrast to
the shock-wave formation in media with normal dispersion [21, 22].
In fact, the steepening
eﬀect is the most striking manifestation of anomalous dispersion, if one takes into account that
usually the residual absorption causes a misconstruction of the pulse advance.

The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we derive equations for the evolution
of the atomic density matrix and for the ﬁeld transmitted through the medium. Basing on
the analytical solution for the density matrix we give the results of numerical calculations for
the pulse propagation with nonlinear negative group velocity in Sec.3. Our conclusions are
summarized in Sec. 4. Finally, in the Appendix we calculate the nonlinear group-velocity of
light pulse propagating in the Doppler broadened medium for the cases of two-level atom and
three-level Λ-system.

2 Nonlinear negative group velocity in a medium with

Zeeman coherence

It is well known that in linear media the anomalous dispersion always occurs within an ab-
sorption line [1] and leads to negative group velocity for the peak motion of suﬃciently smooth
pulses [4]. However, as can be seen from Fig.2 for the case of a two-level atom, in usual mate-
rials the light pulses experience very large absorption in the vicinity of sharp atomic resonance
that prevents a doubtless observation of high anomalous dispersion [26]. On the other hand,
the light-induced Zeeman coherence in a three-level Λ-atom changes essentially this absorption-
dispersion relationship, making the medium almost transparent, while keeping its dispersion
still very large (Fig.3). Moreover, as it is apparent from Fig.3, there is a frequency range, where

the dispersion on both transitions
is the same and anomalous. This
and
means that the RCP and LCP components of linearly polarized laser ﬁeld travel with the same
negative group velocity. As the latter depends on the light intensity, the pulse advance, being
the minimum at the pulse peak (see below), is diﬀerent for diﬀerent parts of the pulse compared
to the same pulse traveling the same distance in a vacuum. As a result, the trailing edge of
pulse should show self-steepening that can be tested in an interferometric experiment similar
to that performed by L. Wang and co-workers [13].

During the propagation of pulse through the medium the group-velocity dispersion and
self-steepening change the pulse width that violates the approximation of truncated Taylor
expansion Eq.(10). Our aim is to observe the pulse nonlinear steepening under superluminal
propagation without pulse spreading. The source of the latter is the derivative ∂2χ/∂ω2, which
enters in the second term in the rhs of Eq.(11). Since this term is also proportional to the
second time-derivative of the ﬁeld ∂2E/∂t2, the contribution from the group-velocity dispersion
dramatically increases at the distances, where a steep front is formed due to the dependence of
group velocity on light intensity. In order to avoid this complication, as well as to use rightly
the steady-state solution of Eqs.(2), we restrict the upper bound of the sample length by a
value for which the pulse broadening caused by the self-steepening does not exceed the medium
absorption line-width Γ, i.e. the condition

from the well-known fact established for linear media that the optical dispersion of transparent
medium is always normal [27]. The latter directly follows from Kramers-Kronig relations,
that assume linearity and causality in the response of the medium. In our case this response
is nonlinear and the classical Kramers-Kronig relations are no longer valid. The numerical
solution of Eq.(2) in steady-state regime is shown in Fig.3. Our results given by Eqs.(19)-(22)
are in excellent agreement with these calculations.

In further, we need to take into account the Doppler broadening by averaging the matrix
elements ρij over the atomic velocity distribution. Using the results of calculations performed

where b is given by Eq.(A.9).As it follows from Eq.(23), the group velocity index ng reaches its
maximum at the peak value of light intensity. As a result, more intense parts of the pulse move
slower that leads to the steepening of the trailing edge of the pulse. Also, notice that in the
absence of external magnetic ﬁeld, when ∆ = 0, the susceptibilities χi vanish due to complete
population trapping and the pulse moves with the light vacuum velocity c.

The results of numerical integration of Eq.(13) for pulse propagation using Eqs.(23) and

(24) are presented in the next section.

In Fig.4 we plot the absorption of the pulse and the group-advance time calculated from
Eqs.(24) and (15) as a function of the pulse intensity for the set of parameters given above.

It is apparent that the pulse peak is advanced with respect to the same pulse traveling in the
10 ns. The advance
vacuum approximately ﬁfty times, that for L = 6 cm corresponds to Tad
time increases towards to the pulse wings, and it is about 70 ns for the intensity I
0.1 I0.
Since the absorption is strongly reduced around the pulse peak, where the EIT conditions

∆∆D, γc(∆D + Γ),

(31)

are established, the group-advance time should be easily observed by nanosecond resolution
time.

As an illustration, in Fig.5 we give a space-time plot of solution to Eq.(13) for the initial
1 Γ−1. The group-velocity is negative in the medium. This
Gaussian pulse with duration τ
eﬀect appears as a ”back-on-time” motion of the pulse. The formation of sharp back front of
the pulse to the end of the cell is well visible (Fig.5).

≃

In order to reconstruct the superluminal propagation in details we present in Fig.6 the
pulse motion in the form of time-sequence graphs. At ﬁrst, before the incident pulse enters
the medium, a weak pulse is created at the output. Then, this peak increases in time and
eventually splits into forward- and backward-moving pulses with very sharp trailing edges. The
ﬁrst of them continues to move in a vacuum with velocity c, and after a long time it represents
the ﬁnal pulse. The second pulse exhibits, however, an unusual behavior. It increases while
traveling through the absorbing medium. Nevertheless, here there is no inconsistency with the
energy conservation law. Firstly, the velocity of energy transport deﬁned as vE = S/W , where
S and W are the energy ﬂux and ﬁeld energy densities averaged over a period, is always less
than c, as is shown in [28]. Secondly, the increment of the medium energy in the presence
2 [27] and is negative for anomalous-dispersive
of light ﬁeld is proportional to ∂(ωn)/∂ω
|
media. Obviously this energy cannot be stored in the medium and it is transformed into the
backward-moving wave. However, this takes place until the peak of incident pulse enters the
medium. After that, the real absorption of the light pulse results in a cancellation of backward
wave at the entrance of the cell.

· |

E

In Eq.(13) the nonlinear absorption and intensity-dependent group-velocity are responsible
for the reshaping of pulse.
In order to demonstrate the inﬂuence of the two mechanisms
separately we solved Eq.(13) in a hypothetical case of nonlinear absorption, assuming that the
group-velocity is independent on the intensity of light. Setting b=0 in Eq.(23), we calculated a
propagation of Gaussian pulse with the same set of parameters. The results depicted in Fig.7
show that in this case the ﬁnal pulse is built up much earlier than in the case of nonlinear
group-velocity and, what is most important, it preserves the shape and width of incident pulse.
A slight decrease of absorption is observed also.

4 Summary

In this paper we analyzed the superluminal propagation of light-pulse in a nonlinear medium
and showed that necessary conditions for these eﬀects to be observable are realized in a three-
level Λ-system interacting with a linearly polarized laser beam in the presence of a static
magnetic ﬁeld. It is highly important that the nonlinearity of refractive index of the medium
arises in low power regime, when all other nonlinear processes are negligible. Our results
demonstrate that the light-induced Zeeman coherence cancels the resonant absorption of the
medium almost completely, but it preserves the dispersion anomalous and very high. As a result,
the transparent propagation of light pulse with a negative group-velocity, which is nonlinear in
the light intensity, is predicted. This leads to the formation of extremely sharp trailing edge

9

and to the lengthening of the leading edge of the pulse. Such a behavior is inverse to the case
of nonlinear propagation of the pulse in a medium with normal dispersion. The predicted eﬀect
is the most striking manifestation of superluminality and it can be easily observed in the well
known schemes that have been used for studying the nonlinear magneto-optical rotation.

The discussion of many questions remained behind the scope of this paper. In particular,
we have not given due attention to the proof of the fact that the predicted eﬀect does not
violate the causality. Here we note only that the proof is carried out in the same manner as in
previous studies of superluminal propagation [5]. Further, for real atomic systems the complete
energy state description of the multilevel structure should be included. This question requires
a careful examination and it is in current study, the results of which will be presented in the
next publication.

Appendix

Here we calculate the nonlinear group-velocity of light pulse propagating through a Doppler
broadened atomic medium. The cases of two-level atom and three-state Λ-system are consid-
ered. In order to obtain the simple analytical expressions, when averaging the group velocities
over the atomic thermal motion, we approximate the usual Gaussian distribution of atomic
velocity with Lorentzian function W (v) = ∆D/π[∆2
D + (kv)2], where 2∆D is full width half
maximum of Doppler broadening.

In the case of two-level atom the imaginary and real parts of the susceptibility of medium

are given by

where ε = ωat
ω + k v, and Ω is the Rabi frequency of the ﬁeld, which couples the upper and
lower levels of the atom. Straightforward calculation of the velocity-averaged susceptibilities in
the ﬁrst order of ∆ω = ω

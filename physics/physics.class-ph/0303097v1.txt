Abstract

We discuss the electromagnetic energy-momentum distribution and the me-

chanical forces of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in material media. There is a

long-standing controversy on these notions. The Minkowski and the Abra-

ham energy-momentum tensors are the most well-known ones. We propose a

solution of this problem which appears to be natural and self-consistent from

both a theoretical and an experimental point of view.

I. INTRODUCTION

The discussion of the energy-momentum tensor in macroscopic electrodynamics is quite

old. The beginning of this dispute goes back to Minkowski [1], Abraham [2], and Einstein

and Laub [3]. Good reviews of the problem can be found in [4–7], to mention but a few.

Nevertheless, up to now the question was not settled and there is an on-going exchange of

conﬂicting opinions concerning the validity of the Minkowski versus the Abraham energy-

momentum tensor, see [8] for a recent discussion. Even experiments were not quite able to

make a deﬁnite and decisive choice of electromagnetic energy and momentum in material

media.

Here we propose the solution of the problem.

Our basic notations and conventions are as follows. We are using international SI units

throughout. Correspondingly, ε0, µ0 are the electric and the magnetic constant (earlier

called vacuum permittivity and vacuum permeability). The Minkowski metric is gij =

diag(c2,

components, i, j, k, . . . = 0, 1, 2, 3, whereas those from the beginning of the alphabet refer to

3-space: a, b, c, . . . = 1, 2, 3.

II. NEW ENERGY-MOMENTUM TENSOR

Our solution is as follows. The new electromagnetic energy-momentum in an arbitrary

medium reads:

The electromagnetic ﬁeld strength Fij = (E, B) is composed of the electric and magnetic

3-vector ﬁelds. Componentwise, Eq.(1) describes the energy density of the ﬁeld

As one can immediately notice that (1) has the same form as the vacuum energy-

momentum tensor. However, its physical content is diﬀerent, which follows from the fact

that Fij = (E, B) satisﬁes the macroscopic Maxwell equations in matter:

Here ρfree and jfree are the densities of the free (or, in other terminology, the “true” or “ex-

excitations (other names are “electric displacement” and “magnetic ﬁeld intensity”). The

ﬁeld strengths (E, B) and the excitations (D, H) are related by means of the equations

Here the total charge and current density are ρtot = ρfree + ρmat and jtot = jfree + jmat.

This result is quite natural and physically clear. The electromagnetic ﬁeld aﬀects matter

by means of the two Lorentz forces (12): One acts on the free charge and current (ρfree, jfree)

(on the conductive current, for example), and another force acts on the bound charge and

current (9). The latter have also a direct physical meaning in the macroscopic (Lorentz type

averaging) framework and in the microscopic approaches, see Hirst [9], e.g. The temporally

and spatially varying polarization and magnetization give rise to the electric and magnetic

ﬁelds, like the free charges and currents do. Conversely, the bound charges and currents

should also feel the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the same way as the free charges and currents

The representation of the total electromagnetic force as the sum of the two terms with the

clear-cut physical content (12) suggests a natural step to split the original energy-momentum

(1) into the corresponding sum of the two energy-momentum tensors which are associated

with the free and bound charge/current, respectively. Using (8) in (1), we ﬁnd

j = fTi

Thus indeed, tensors in the sum (13) are associated with the two diﬀerent types of

charges and currents in the material medium. The divergences produce, essentially, the

two independent Lorentz forces acting separately on the free and on the bound charge and

current.

III. SOME PROPERTIES AND APPLICATIONS

After all these preliminaries and formal derivations, we are in a position to discuss

the physical properties of the energy-momentum (1). At ﬁrst, some remarks about (1) in

5

comparison to the Minkowski and Abraham tensors. Many authors (see the discussions in

[5–7]) pointed to a clearly unphysical result produced by the Minkowski energy-momentum:

in the absence of free charges and currents, a homogeneous medium appears to be always

subject to the zero electromanetic force. This fact was usually taken in favor of the Abraham

tensor which predicts an extra, so called Abraham force. However, the energy-momentum

(1) does not suﬀer from such a deﬁciency. Even when the free charge and current densities

are vanishing, the total force is, in general, non-trivial in view of the presence of polarization

charge and current. Moreover, as compared to the rather ad hoc choice of the Abraham

force, the mechanical action on the bound charge and current is in all cases described, using

(1), by the well-known Lorentz force (12).

Furthermore, the Minkowski tensor is asymmetric which is obvious from the comparison

of the energy ﬂux fs and the ﬁeld momentum fp in (16). Usually, this fact was also taken in

favor of the Abraham tensor, which is symmetric. At the same time, despite its symmetry,

the structure of the Abraham tensor is deﬁned in a rather ad hoc manner with opaque

physical motivations. In contrast to this, the energy-momentum (1) is naturally symmetric

and the electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum (4) is related to the energy ﬂux (3) as p = s/c2.

This is the famous Planck relation which generalizes the Einsteinian ∆m = ∆E/c2 relation

to ﬁeld theory. The interesting discussion of von Laue [10] was concentrated mainly around

this point.

As a simple application, let us consider the propagation of an electromagnetic plane

wave from the vacuum into a dielectric medium with µ = 1 and refractive index n = √ε.

More exactly, like in the previous discussions [11,6,7], we will conﬁne ourselves to the case

of a gaseous medium consisting of heavy atoms. We assume normal incidence on a plane

boundary and we recall the reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients R = (n

1)/(n + 1) and

−

T = 2/(n + 1), respectively. Then, for incident and reﬂected waves in vacuum, we ﬁnd for

the mean ﬁeld energy (15) and momentum (16), if averaged over one period,

(27)

Here E0 is the amplitude of the electric ﬁeld and k the unit wave vector which speciﬁes the

direction of propagation. Comparing the above formulas, we see that both, the total energy

and the total momentum calculated on the basis of (1), are conserved on the passage of the

wave into the medium. This conclusion is in a complete agreement with the previous studies

[11,6,7]. Moreover, it can be supplemented by a far more detailed analysis of wave propaga-

tion in a gaseous media that has demonstrated [11,6,7] the plausibility of the (“Abraham”)

ﬁeld momentum E

H/c. However, since all these studies were conﬁned to dielectrics with

×

µ = 1, the arguments presented in [11,6,7] in actual fact give support to the ﬁeld momentum

(4) likewise.

IV. WALKER AND WALKER EXPERIMENT

Finally, let us discuss the direct experimental conﬁrmations of the energy-momentum

(1). For this purpose, as a ﬁrst example, we recall the measurements of Walker & Walker

[12] of the force acting on a dielectric disk placed in crossed oscillating electric and magnetic

ﬁelds, see Fig.1(a). The scheme of the experiment is as follows: The symmetry of the

problem suggests to use cylindrical coordinates (r, ϕ, z). A small cylinder is made of barium

titanate with ε = 3340 and µ = 1. Its height in z-direction is l

2 cm, internal radius

≈

r1

0.4 cm, and external radius r2

2.6 cm. This disk is suspended between the poles of

≈

≈

an electromagnet which creates the harmonically oscillating axial magnetic ﬁeld. Besides,

the oscillating ﬁeld, with the phase diﬀerence of π/2, a radial electric ﬁeld is created by

7

means of an alternating voltage applied between the inner and the outer cylindrical surfaces

of the disk. The oscillation frequency of the ﬁelds is rather low, namely, ω = 60 Hz. As a

consequence, everywhere in the disk rωn/c

Let us derive the theoretical value of the torque which is given by the volume integral

Since there are no free charges and currents in the dielectric, the Lorentz force (12) reduces

only to the second term determined by the bound charges and currents. One can check

that the Maxwell equations (6), (7), together with the constitutive relations D = εε0E and

B = µ0H, are solved by the electric and magnetic ﬁeld conﬁguration

These approximate formulas are valid with very high accuracy due to the fact that

1 everywhere in the disk. As usual, (er, eϕ, ez) denote the local

orthonormal frame vectors of the cylindrical coordinate system. Here B0 is the magnitude

of the oscillating axial magnetic ﬁeld and U0 is the amplitude of the voltage applied between

the inner (r = r1) and the outer (r = r2) cylindrical surfaces of the disk, ∆U = U0 sin(ωt).

The bound charge and current densities (9) are straightforwardly found to be ρmat = 0

and jmat = ˙P = ε0(ε

This result was experimentally conﬁrmed by Walker & Walker [12]. Although the authors

of [12] apparently noticed that the torque measured ﬁts the understanding of the electro-

magnetic force as the Lorentz force for the polarization current (in agreement with our

approach), they ultimately claimed that their experiment conﬁrms the Abraham force. The

8

theoretical explanation presented in [12] was based on the idea that the Maxwell stress Sa

b

caused the unusual surface drag of the disk. However, when computing the force, see (12),

the contribution of the stress ∂b Sa

b should be complemented by the momentum term

the latter is missing in [12]. The alternative explanation [5] is based on the computation of

forces on the metal coatings of the cylinder. This yields the result where the factor (ε

−

above is replaced by ε. Since the dielectric matter in question has ε = 3340, this experiment

thus cannot be treated as the critical test for the diﬀerent energy-momenta.

V. EXPERIMENT OF JAMES

As another example we consider the experiment of James [13] which is in many respects

very similar to the one of Walker & Walker. James, see Fig.1(b), had also placed a disk

into crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The small cylinders were made of a composition

of nickel-zinc ferrite with µ = 16 or 43 and ε

7. Like in [12], the radial electric ﬁeld

≈

was created by means of an oscillating voltage applied between the inner and the outer

cylindrical surface of the disk. However, instead of an axial magnetic ﬁeld, an azimuthal

magnetic ﬁeld was produced inside matter by an alternating electric current in a conducting

wire placed along the axis of the disk. The resulting ﬁeld conﬁguration reads:

1 which is

fulﬁlled in James’ experiment everywhere in the cylinders with r1, r2 and the length l of order

1-3 centimeter. Here I0 is the amplitude of the alternating current I = I0 sin(ωit) along the z-

axis, whereas U0 gives, as before, the amplitude of the oscillating voltage, ∆U = U0 sin(ωut).

The frequencies ωi and ωu are diﬀerent and are varied in the course of the experiment between

10 and 30 kHz. Since this experiment, unlike [12], covers also magnetic media, we display

the nontrivial permeability µ. One can check that (32), (33) satisfy the Maxwell equations

9

(6), (7).

A. Electromagnetic force in James’ experiment

James [13] measured the force

Fz acting along the axis of the disk in the crossed ﬁelds
(32), (33). Let us derive the theoretical value of this force by using the general expression

for the force density (12). There are no free charges and currents inside matter, ρfree = 0

and jfree = 0. By substituting (32), (33) into (9), we ﬁnd ρmat = 0 and

jmat = ε0 (µε

B. Minkowski and Abraham forces in James’ experiment

In the isotropic case under consideration, εab = δab ε and µab = δab µ. With the

free charges and currents absent, the Minkowski 3-force density (21) reduces to the last

term which contributes only at the ends of the cylinder.

Since the permittivity has

the constant value of ε

= 1 inside the body, i.e.

for

l/2 < z < l/2, and drops to

C. Theories versus experiment

All the theoretical expressions for the electromagnetic force look similar:

compare

(37) with (43) and (44). However, the crucial diﬀerence is revealed when we recall that

James measured not the force itself but a “reduced force” deﬁned as the mean value

1
2 [

Fz(ωu, ωi = ωu + ω0) +

Fz(ωu, ωi = ωu −

ω0)], see eq.

(9) on page 60 of James’ thesis

[13] and the footnote on page 158 of [5]. With high accuracy, James observed the vanishing

of the reduced force in his experiment. This observation is in complete agreement with the

theoretical derivation (37) based on our new energy-momentum tensor, whereas both, the

expressions of Minkowski (43) and of Abraham (44), clearly contradict this experiment.

The explanation proposed in [5] in support of the Abraham force appears to be incon-

sistent mathematically and misleading physically. Namely, the computation of the force is

reduced in [5] to the evaluation of the surface integral of the Maxwell stress in the vac-

uum “just outside the disk”. However, instead of the usual continuity of the tangential

electric ﬁeld, an unsubstantiated matching condition was introduced for E on the boundary

(z =

l/2) in order to ﬁnd the ﬁelds outside the disk. Such a derivation [which yields a result

±

diﬀerent from (44) above] cannot be considered to be a satisfactory theoretical explanation.

To begin with, there is not any good reason why one should replace a well-deﬁned volume

integral for the total force by a surface integral. Formally, this is allowed, of course, but as

soon as we know the ﬁelds inside the body everywhere, see (32) and (33), we can proceed

directly by constructing the explicit expressions of the force densities (21), (22), and (40)

and then straightforwardly ﬁnd the corresponding volume integrals. There is no logical need

to perform an auxiliary computation in order to ﬁnd the vacuum ﬁelds “just outside” the

body, which appears to be a separate nontrivial problem. Provided the latter problem is

solved correctly, we anticipate that the ﬁnal result would agree with our (44). And certainly,

one should use the standard matching conditions since this amounts to nothing else than to

apply Maxwell’s equations in a thin neighborhood near the surface. Accordingly, as to the

matching of the electric ﬁeld, we can only impose (as usual) the continuity of the tangential

12

components of electric ﬁeld. Imposing a diﬀerent discontinuity condition [as was done in eq.

(3.17) of ref. [5], e.g.] is tantamount to assuming that Maxwell’s equations are violated near

and across the boundary.

In our theoretical analysis, we used the ﬁeld conﬁguration (32), (33) which is valid

inside of the cylinder. Near the ends, strictly speaking, one should take into account the

deformation of the ﬁelds. However, it is well known that the corresponding corrections are

conﬁned to the regions very close to the ends. More exactly, the most important point is

that the resulting end corrections for the total force are not proportional to the length of

the cylinder. In other words, such end corrections (provided one computes them carefully)

obviously would not compensate the reduced force of Minkowski (43) and of Abraham (44),

which are both proportional to the length l. It is worthwhile to note that the end corrections

were never taken into account in the previous analyses [13,5], and we use here precisely the

same ﬁeld conﬁguration (32), (33) as in [13,5].

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Let us summarize our results. In the present paper we gave evidence that the correct

energy-momentum tensor of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in material media is described by (1).

This tensor is symmetric and satisﬁes Planck’s ﬁeld-theoretical generalization p = s/c2

of Einstein’s formula ∆m = ∆E/c2. The corresponding electromagnetic force turns out

to be the Lorentz force acting on the free and bound charge and current densities. The

energy-momentum (1) can be naturally represented as a sum (13) of the Minkowski energy-

momentum and the bound-charge energy-momentum tensor.

Our derivations here are in fact motivated by our axiomatic approach to classical elec-

trodynamics [14] in which the Lorentz force represents one of the fundamental postulates of

the scheme. In particular, if one starts from the Lorentz force equations (11) and (12) and

reverses the order of the equations, one ﬁnally derives the energy-momentum tensor (1) that

we ﬁrst introduced without preliminary explanations. Besides the evidence of the general

13

validity of the Lorentz force axiom for point particles, a careful analysis of the wave prop-

agation in material media as well as a proper interpretation of the experiments by Walker

& Walker and by James, give further support to this basic cornerstone of classical elec-

trodynamics. In our discussion we did not touch the electro- and magnetostriction eﬀects

because their consideration requires a more detailed speciﬁcation of the internal mechanical

properties of the medium. Moreover, in most cases the overall electro- and magnetostriction

eﬀects are balanced and are not directly observable.

At the present level of understanding, we can thus conclude that the tensor (1) passes

the theoretical and experimental tests and qualiﬁes for a correct description of the energy-

momentum properties of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in macroscopic electrodynamics.

As we have learned recently, the same energy-momentum tensor was introduced by

P. Poincelot [15] who insisted on the equal physical treatment of the free and the polar-

izational charges and currents. Such an equality is natural in our axiomatic approach to

electrodynamics [14].

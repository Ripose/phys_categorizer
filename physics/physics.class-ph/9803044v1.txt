Abstract

In this paper we analyze the spinning motion of the hovering mag-
netic top. We have observed that its motion looks diﬀerent from that
of a classical top. A classical top rotates about its own axis which pre-
cesses around a vertical ﬁxed external axis. The hovering magnetic
top, on the other hand, has its axis slightly tilted and moves rigidly

as a whole about the vertical axis. We call this motion synchronous,
because in a stroboscopic experiment we see that a point at the rim
of the top moves synchronously with the top axis.

We show that the synchronous motion may be attributed to a
small deviation of the magnetic moment from the symmetry axis of
the top. We show that as a consequence, the minimum angular ve-
3 for I3 > I1 and
locity required for stability is given by
µH/(I3 − I1) for I3 < I1. Here, I3 and I1 are the principal and
by
secondary moments of inertia, µ is the magnetic moment, and H is the
magnetic ﬁeld. For comparison, the minimum angular for a classical
top is given by

3 both for I3 < I1 and for I3 > I1.

1 Introduction.

1.1 The hovering magnetic top.

The hovering magnetic top is an ingenious device that hovers in mid-air while
spinning. It is marketed as a kit in the U.S.A. and Europe under the trade
name LevitronT M [1, 2] and in Japan under the trade name U-CAS[3]. The
whole kit consists of three main parts: A magnetized top which weighs about
18gr, a thin (lifting) plastic plate and a magnetized square base plate (base).
To operate the top one should set it spinning on the plastic plate that covers
the base. The plastic plate is then raised slowly with the top until a point is
reached in which the top leaves the plate and spins in mid-air above the base
for about 2min. The hovering height of the top is approximately 3.0 cm above
the surface of the base whose dimensions are about 10cm×10cm×2cm. The
kit comes with extra brass and plastic ﬁne tuning weights as the apparatus
is very sensitive to the weight of the top. It also comes with two wedges to
balance the base horizontally.

The hovering magnetic top serves as an excellent model to study many
branches of physics. These include magnetism, electricity, hydrodynamics,
mechanics of rigid body, wave mechanics, dynamical stability of non linear
as well as linear systems, life time of quasi-stationary states and solid state
magnetism to name just a few. For example, in the ﬁeld of neutral parti-

2

cle trapping the hovering magnetic top is a vivid macroscopic device which
demonstrates how it is possible to trap a neutral particle with spin in a static
magnetic ﬁeld. In fact, one of the recent examples of such traps was devised
and applied to trap Rb87 atoms and to form Bose-Einstein condensation[4, 5].
The trap used in this experiment is based on a rotating magnetic ﬁeld and
was given the name TOP (Time-averaged Orbiting Potential) trap. Though
the TOP trap consists of a time dependent ﬁeld it nevertheless operates on
roughly the same principles as the trap of the hovering magnetic top.
In
addition to understanding magnetic traps there are many other issues that
can be addressed by studying the hovering magnetic top. Questions such as:
How high can it hover?, How long does it hover?, What are the tolerances
on the mass of the top and the tilt angle of the base? How the trap works
in the quantum regime? and other questions have been studied recently
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] whereas other questions such as how does friction aﬀect
the stability of the top are currently under study.

1.2 The synchronous motion.

The physical principles underlying the dynamical stability of the hovering
magnetic top rely on the so-called ‘adiabatic approximation’ and have re-
cently been discussed in several papers [12, 13, 14, 15]. In these articles the
top was modeled as an axially symmetric shape with its magnetization taken
as a dipole pointing along the symmetry axis and situated at the center of
mass. Observing the top as it hovers forced us however, to augment this pic-
ture by assuming that the dipole is canted by a small angle ∆ with respect to
the symmetry axis of the top. We were motivated by the fact that the motion
of the magnetic top as it hovers looked diﬀerent from that of a classical top
(but also by recalling that it would be forced by manufacturing tolerances).
As a classical top slows down it starts to deviate from the vertical while it
precesses with a frequency which is not synchronous to the frequency of the
spin of the top around its axis. The axis of the hovering magnetic top is
also canted to the vertical but the motion is synchronous. There is only one
frequency involved. This can even be seen with the naked eye. The axis of
the magnetic top rotates around the vertical but synchronously with the spin
of the top around itself. An analogy, though not literal, is helpful here: The
motion of the hovering magnetic top is reminiscent of the motion of the moon
around the earth but that of a classical top is more like the rotation of the

3

earth around the sun. The astute observer watching the hovering magnetic
top will note that the canting increases as the top slows down, even with
the naked eye. It was more conspicuous to us when we observed it with a
stroboscope preferably strobed at twice or three times the synchronous fre-
quency. Using the latter frequency enabled also to measure the phase of the
tilt. It is this way that we found this phase is correlated to the phase of ∆-
the canting of the magnetic moment with respect to the axis of the top. We
reach the same conclusion by observing in slow motion videos of hovering
tops in which we changed ∆ artiﬁcially. As will be shown in the following
the canting ∆ explains all the above observations.

The present paper is in fact a study of the eﬀect of this small canting
∆ on the hovering of the magnetic top. In addition to explaining the above
qualitative features we also derive quantitative results. In particular we show
that the minimum angular velocity required for stability ωmin is given by

Here, I3 and I1 are the principal and secondary moment of inertia, µ is the
magnetic moment of the top and H is the magnetic ﬁeld. This result is to
be contrasted with the minimum speed of a classical top[16] which is given
by

3 for both I3 < I1 and I3 > I1.

4µHI1/I 2

On the experimental side, we have measured the minimum speed of a
q
hovering top whose moment of inertia I1 can be changed so as to cover values
both below and above I3. These results show excellent agreement with our
calculations.

1.3 The structure of this paper.

The structure of this paper is as follows: In Sec.(2) we carry out a detailed
analysis of the synchronous motion. We ﬁrst describe precisely what is meant
by the synchronous motion and deﬁne our notations in Sec.(2.1). In Sec.(2.2)
we study the conditions that must be met in order for the system to reach
equilibrium. Next, in Sec.(2.3) we carry out a dynamical stability analysis
to ﬁnd under what conditions the equilibrium solution found previously is

4

indeed stable. Finally, in Sec.(2.4) we combine all the conditions that were
found both from equilibrium considerations and dynamical stability consid-
erations, and arrive at the expressions for the minimum angular velocity. The
description of our experiment and a comparison of the results with the the-
oretical calculations from the previous section is given in Sec.(3). In Sec.(4),
we summarize our results and discuss possible extensions of the calculations
presented in this paper and other related subjects.

2 Analysis of the Synchronous motion.

2.1 Description of the Problem.

As the top hovers above the magnetized plate, the magnetic lift force ex-
erted by the base is balanced by the top weight. Therefore, to simplify
further calculations we assume that gravity is zero and the magnetic ﬁeld
is homogeneous. Further, we disregard the translational motion of the top
and assume that it move around a ﬁxed point. This point is taken as the
common origin of the moving and ﬁxed system of coordinates. With these
simpliﬁcations the synchronous motion can be modeled as shown in Fig.(1).

The ﬁgure describes a top that rotates rigidly around the vertical ˆz axis
with angular velocity ω. The principal axis of the top (axis ˆn) makes an
angle θ0 with the vertical axis. The whole system is in a uniform magnetic
ﬁeld H, pointing downward. The top possesses a magnetic moment dipole,
µ, that makes an angle ∆ with its principal axis.

2.2 Equilibrium considerations.

We ﬁrst determine the angle between the top axis ˆn and the vertical axis
ˆz from torque equilibrium. The angular momentum of a symmetric top has
the form[17]

L = I3ω3 ˆn + I1 ˆn × d ˆn
dt

(1)

5

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

where ω3 is the component of the vector angular velocity ˆω in the direction
of the ˆn axis. Since ˆn is ﬁxed in the body,

and therefore

L = (I3 − I1) ω3 ˆn + I1ω.

For the synchronous motion, the gyroscopic torque in the co-moving frame
must compensate the magnetic torque, hence

d ˆn
dt

= ω × ˆn,

ω × L = µ × H.

Thus, µ has to be coplanar with ˆz and ˆn, and one obtain, with ω3 = ω cos θ0,
the equilibrium condition

(I3 − I1)ω2 sin θ0 cos θ0 = µH sin(θ0 + ∆).

We assume that the angle ∆ is small. Then, during its motion the top
axis ˆn stays close to the ˆz axis, and we may use small angle approximation
in Eq.(5) and express θ0 in terms of ω as follows:

θ0 ≃

µH∆
(I3 − I1)ω2 − µH

.

In order to understand what Eq.(6) means we must resort to a more realistic
description of the hovering top. If we take into account air friction and the
inhomogeneity of the magnetic ﬁeld, the following picture emerges: As the
top hovers, it experience air friction which causes ω to decrease with time.
Thus, according to Eq.(6) θ0 increases provided that I3 > I1 (a disk-like top).
This, on the other hand, decreases the repulsive force on the top which is
caused by the ﬁeld gradient. Thus, the top rebalances itself at a lower height.
This process continues until the ﬁeld gradient reaches its maximum value,
that occurs at a height equal roughly to half the size of the base. At this
point the magnetic ﬁeld can no longer support the top and the latter falls
down vertically. In our experiments we could clearly see that θ0 increases
gradually by the naked eye. We conclude that when θ0 is ‘large enough’
the top will fall down. We denote by θ∗
0 the maximum allowed angle. The

6

angular velocity which correspond to this angle is, according to Eq.(6), given
by

To estimate θ∗
toleance allowed on the lift. It follows that[10]

0 we recall that the tolernace on the weight is equal to the

Since the tolerance on the weight is about 2% (see Ref.[10]) it follows that
θ∗
0 ∼ 0.1rad. Although we did not measure ∆ directly, our experiments,
including those in which we have artiﬁcially changed ∆ indicate that ∆/θ∗
0 ≪
1. It is therefore justiﬁed to neglect this term in Eq.(7) and we arrive to an
approximate expression for the minimum speed when I3 > I1, namely:

ωstat
min ≃

µH
I3 − I1

s

for I3 > I1.

For a rod-like top (I3 < I1) the synchronous motion is also possible, but
now ∆ must be more negative than −θ0. This is because in this case the
direction of the centrifugal torque is reversed, and for equilibrium to exist the
magnetic torque must also be reversed. The condition that ∆ < −θ0 gives
ω > 0 which signiﬁes that as far as the equilibrium condition is concerned
there is no minimum speed for this case. Following similar arguments as
before it can be easily deduced that in this case θ0 decreases with time and
the top slowly gains height as it slows down due to air friction. This is
opposite of what we have found for a disk-like top.

Note also that the rod-like top exhibits diamagneic-like behavior. Namely,
the diﬀerential susceptibility is in this case negative as can be seen from
Eq.(6).

Summarizing our results so far we conclude that as far as the equilibrium
condition is concerned the minimum allowed angular velocity depends on the
eccentricity of the top and is given by

and is valid both for clockwise and counter-clockwise directions of the spin.
Note that Eq.(8) is not the all answer because the dynamical stability should
also be considered. This is done in the following section.

2.3 Dynamic stability considerations.

2.3.1 Overview

Up to this point we have studied conditions that were derived directly from
the equilibrium condition. In this section we study the conditions that must
be met in order to sustain the synchronous motion. We start by reformulating
the equations of motion in terms of the Lagrangian formalism and Euler’s
angles, and then add to the synchronous motion a small perturbation. We
then arrive at a set of equations for the perturbational part and ﬁnd the
conditions that are required for the perturbation to be oscillatory which is
the condition that the unperturbed motion is stable.

2.3.2 The Lagrangian and the equations of motion.

We denote the coordinate system ﬁxed in space by (ˆx, ˆy, ˆz) and the other
that is ﬁxed in the body by (ˆ1, ˆ2, ˆn), as depicted in Fig.(2). The magnetic
moment µ makes an angle ∆ with the ˆn axis and lies in the ˆ2- ˆn plane. Thus

µ = µ

ˆn cos ∆ − ˆ2 sin ∆
(cid:16)
(cid:17)

.

The magnetic ﬁeld is uniform and points along the −ˆz direction, i.e.

H = −H ˆz = −H

ˆ1 sin ψ sin θ + ˆ2 cos ψ sin θ + ˆn cos θ
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

,

where φ, θ and ψ are the ﬁrst, second and third Euler’s angles, deﬁned in
Fig.(2). Therefore, the magnetic energy for this conﬁguration has the form

Emag = −µ · H = µH (cos θ cos ∆ − sin ∆ cos ψ sin θ) .

The kinetic energy, expressed using Euler’s angle, is

2.3.3 The Stationary Solution.

A stationary solution to the set Eqs.(11) is found by setting

θ(t) = θ0 = Const.

ψ(t) = ψ0 = Const.

Substituting these into the third equation of the set Eqs.(11) and integrating
over time yields

Using the second equation we ﬁnd that

φ(t) = ω = Const.

ψ0 = 0,

while the remaining (ﬁrst) equation gives

(I3 − I1)ω2 sin θ0 cos θ0 = µH sin(θ0 + ∆).

Note that Eq.(15) is identical to Eq.(5), which was derived in Sec.(2.2).

2.3.4 Perturbing the stationary solution.

We now perturb the stationary solution by adding small variations,

˙φ(t) = ˙φs(t) + δ ˙φ(t) = ω + δ ˙φ(t)
ψ(t) = ψs(t) + δψ(t) = 0 + δψ(t)
θ(t) = θs(t) + δθ(t) = θ0 + δθ(t)

Substituting this these into Eqs.(11) and keeping only ﬁrst-order terms yields

I1δ ¨θ + (I3 − I1)ωδ ˙φ sin(2θ0)

(cid:17)

Using Eq.(15) we express ∆ in terms of θ0 and to simplify further calcu-
lations we now restrict ourselves to the case where θ0 is a small angle and
work to second-order in θ0. Under the small-angle approximation Eqs.(17)
becomes

Thus, we ﬁnd a doubly degenerate zero eigenvalue corresponding to the cyclic
coordinate φ, which enter the equations of motion only through its time
derivative. The other eigenvalues are the roots of a quadratic equation in λ2.
For the perturbation to be bounded for all times, the non-vanishing eigen-
values must be purely imaginary. Thus, the two λ2 roots must be both real
and negative. The condition for these roots to be real is that b2 − 4ac > 0.
This results in the inequality

which is the well-known stability condition of a classical top with one point
ﬁxed[16]. For both roots to be negative, their product must be positive (i.e.
c/a > 0) and their sum must be negative (−b/a < 0). Since both a and c are
squares of real numbers, their ratio is positive. We thus ﬁnd as the second
condition

It may be easily veriﬁed that for a physical top, for which I3 < 2I1, the
inequality Eq.(21) is satisﬁed whenever Eq.(20) holds. Therefore, the overall
condition for the stability of the synchronous motion is given by Eq.(20)
alone, namely

2.4 Conclusions.

Hitherto we have found separate conditions for the minimum angular speed,
one pair given in Eq.(8) arising from equilibrium considerations, the other one
given in Eq.(22) originating from dynamical stability considerations. Since
these conditions must be satisﬁed simultaneously, we now take the union
of these conditions. Taking into account the fact that for a disk-like top
4µHI1/I 2
3 , we ﬁnd that the union of these

µH/(I3 − I1) is larger than

conditions amounts to the following expressions for ωmin:

(23)

According to this result, there should be an abrupt change in ωmin in the
vicinity of a sphere-like top (I1 = I3) even for a vanishingly small value of the
angle ∆. This abrupt change is also found in our experiments, as is shown
in the next section.

3 Experimental Results.

To test our calculations we have built a magnetized top whose moment of
inertia I1 can be changed so as to cover values both below and above I3.
We have measured the minimum angular speed of the top for several values
of I1/I3. Fig.(3) shows (in bullets) the reciprocal of the measured angular
speed normalized to the minimum angular speed of a pure disk top versus x ≡
(I3 − I1)/I1. To compare these results to our calculation we rewrite Eq.(23)
as an equation for the normalized reciprocal angular speed ωmin (1) /ωmin (x)
in terms of x. The result is

Fig.(3) shows ωmin (1) /ωmin (x) as a solid line. It is clear from the ﬁgure that
the experimental results support our theory.

The two main features of our theoretical results are: 1) the divergence of
ωmin for disk-like tops as they approach spherical shape and 2) the disconti-
nuity in ωmin as one goes over to rod-like top. 1) Unfortunately, we could not
go beyond ω > 2.5ωmin(1) because the maximum spin frequency is limited
by the dynamic stability of the top in the trap[14]. It is therefore impossible
to observe experimentally the above divergence. 2) Though we have only two
measured points at the rod-like part of the graph it is conspicuous that they
verify the diﬀerence in the origin of the instability for disk- and rod-like tops
that our theory shows.

4 Discussion.

In this paper we have analyzed one possible cause for the synchronous motion
and attributed it to the small diﬀerence between the direction of the principal
axis of inertia and the direction of the magnetic moment. We have shown that
as a consequence, for a disk-like top the minimum angular velocity required
for stability diﬀers from that for a classical top (with one point ﬁxed) and is

We remark that in the calculations presented in this paper we have ne-
glected some aspects which are relevant to the behavior of the top. For
example, the dipole moment of the top carries with it a minute amount of
intrinsic spin of the order of S ∼ ~µ/µB where ~ is Planck’s constant and
µB is the Bohr’s magneton. The existence of the spin contributes an addi-
tional term to the total angular momentum written in Eq.(2). In this case
the symmetry between clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) rota-
tions breaks down, and one ﬁnds diﬀerent values for the minimum angular
speed for each direction. Due to the smallness of the spin with respect to the
orbital angular momentum, the CW-CCW asymmetry becomes pronounced
only when the size of the top is of the order of tenths of microns. Our cal-
culations show that when the sense of rotation is roughly antiparallel to the
direction of the spin the minimum angular speed increases, whereas when it
is roughly parallel to the spin, the minimum angular speed decreases. This
conclusion immediately raises the question whether it is possible to hover
a top using its intrinsic spin alone without the need to spin it. To study
this we assume the top to be endowed intrincily with spin proportional to
its magnetic moment. We ﬁnd that it may be possible to hover a top having
only this spin with no additional angular momentum[18].

Another interesting point is what happens if we relinquish the requirement
that θ0 is small. Note that the equilibrium equation Eq.(5) is that of the
well-known Stoner and Wolfarth model (SW)[19, 20], extensively used to

case at most only two of the equilibria are stable. We ﬁnd, however, in our
case the unstable SW becomes stable under some conditions, being stabilized
by the dynamics. A word of warning is due here when applying these results
to the hovering top. We have in this work considered only the rotational
degrees of freedom, and what is stable under these is not necessarily stable

any more in an inhomogeneous ﬁeld necessary to trap the top. We believe
however that the small angle solution is still stable there under the same
conditions that are given by us[14] for ∆ = 0.

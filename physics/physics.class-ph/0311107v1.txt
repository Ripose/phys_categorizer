Abstract

Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37235, USA

A logical error in the usual derivation of the energy conservation law is analyzed, and a

way to avoid the error is presented.

In earlier papers [1], [2] we identiﬁed a logical error adopted by repetition in textbooks on
classical electrodynamics when the laws of conservation of energy and momentum are derived
for a system consisting of electromagnetic ﬁelds and charged particles. In this paper we analyze
the derivation of the energy conservation law, discuss the origin of the logical error made in this
derivation, and present a way to avoid the error.

We start by reviewing brieﬂy the usual derivation of the energy conservation law in classical
electrodynamics. By combining the Maxwell equations in the usual way and integrating over
a volume V bounded by the surface A, using the divergence theorem, we obtain Poynting’s
theorem [3], [4]

is the energy density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld (SI units are used throughout), E the electric
ﬁeld, B the magnetic induction, J = ρv the current density, ρ the charge density, v the velocity
of the charge in volume element dV, S = E × B/µ0 the Pointing vector, ˆn the unit vector normal
to the surface A, and dA the element of area of the bounding surface.

Up to this point there are no inconsistencies, at least for continuous distributions of charge
and electromagnetic ﬁelds that are free of singularities. The problems arise when Poynting’s
theorem is generalized to include point charges, for in this case the total energy in the ﬁelds (the
ﬁrst term in (1)) diverges and the ﬁeld E at the position of the charge (in the last term in (1))
is not deﬁned. The problems become worse when we generalize (1) to construct a global law for
the conservation of electromagnetic and mechanical energy, for in this case the self-forces of the
electromagnetic ﬁelds of a particle on itself contribute to the inertia of the particle and to the
radiation reaction on the particle [3], [4]. We ordinarily include the inertial eﬀect of the self-
ﬁelds in the observed mass of the particle, and therefore double-count it when we add the kinetic
energy of the particles to the energy of the ﬁelds to ﬁnd the total energy in the system. The
radiation reaction has its problems as well: it causes unphysical motions of the particle. Thus,
the electrodynamics of point charges is fraught with contradictions. They persist in quantum
electrodynamics.

To simplify the following discussion, we extend the volume V to include all space and consider
a closed system of particles, so there are no “external” ﬁelds coming in from inﬁnity. External

ﬁelds can be regarded as the ﬁelds from other particles that we include in the closed system.
If the ﬁelds vanish suﬃciently rapidly at inﬁnity, the integral of the poynting vector over the
surface A vanishes and we are left with

When the current density arises from a set of point charges qi at positions ri, the current

density J may be expressed in the form

where vi = dri/dt is the velocity of the ith particle. When we substitute this into (3) and
integrate over all space, the conservation law becomes

But the rate at which work is done on the ith particle is just the rate of increase of the

energy ei of the ith particle,

If we substitute this into (6), we get the global conservation law

is the total energy of the particles.

However, for point charges, this derivation has three problems. In the ﬁrst place, the electro-
magnetic energy density w in the ﬁelds of the particles diverges at the positions of the particles.
In the second place, the ﬁeld E (ri) includes the self-ﬁelds Ei (ri). It is not deﬁned at the position
of the ith particle. Typically, E (ri) is restricted to the ﬁeld of the other particles, which is well
behaved at ri, and in the derivation of the energy conservation law, the self-ﬁelds Ei (ri) of the
particle (the inertial and the radiation reaction) are ignored [3], [4]. This is an annoying error.
In the third place, the energy of the Coulomb ﬁeld surrounding a particle is generally included
as part of the mechanical energy of the particle. That is, in the nonrelativistic limit

where the observed mass mi includes both the “bare mass” of the particle and the kinetic
energy attributable to the self-electromagnetic ﬁeld of the particle. Since this electromagnetic
contribution is inﬁnite, for a point charge, the bare mass of the particle is assumed to be negative

ei = 1

2 miv2
i ,

(10)

and inﬁnite in a way that nearly cancels out the electromagnetic contribution, leaving a ﬁnite
observed mass. This is called renormalization. Even if we set aside questions about the validity
of dealing with divergent quantities in this way, it still means that we have counted the energy
of the electromagnetic ﬁelds of the particles twice in the conservation law (8), once in W and
once in E. Thus, we have introduced a logical inconsistency, and the conservation law expressed
by (7) - (9) is incorrect as it stands. Unfortunately, this error appears in almost every text on
electrodynamics [3], [4]. Conservation laws for the linear momentum and angular momentum
(or the 4-vector momentum) similar to (7) - (9) can also be derived, but they have the same
fundamental problems. Moreover, the energy and momentum of the self-ﬁeld do not have the
correct relativistic transformation properties. This is the so-called 4/3 problem, and it is resolved
only by introducing the so-called Poincar´e stresses [5], [6], [7] In the following we consider the
nonrelativistic case, since all the diﬃculties (including the 4/3 problem) are exhibited, and the
relativistic eﬀects are not essential to the argument.

We begin with the last term in (6) or (7), and focus our attention on the self-ﬁeld contri-
bution Ei (ri) to E (ri). To see how to handle the self-interaction, we consider the motion of
an extended charge distribution and then examine the limit when the size of the distribution
vanishes. Unfortunately, if we take the limit in the usual way we obtain an equation of motion
that has nonphysical solutions. The details are described in the Appendix, but for now it is
enough to point out that the self-electromagnetic force on a small, spherically symmetric, shell
of charge can be represented by the series

(11)

in the nonrelativistic case, where a is the radius of the charge distribution and brackets ¡¿ denote
averaging through the particle volume. In the nonrelativistic limit, which is valid in the particle
rest frame, we can ignore magnetic eﬀects. If we overlook the fact that the derivation is based
on the concept of a rigid charge distribution, which is impossible in relativistic kinematics,
the relativistic generalization of (11) is straightforward. The ﬁrst term in (11) is negative
and proportional to the acceleration. It resists the acceleration in just the way that the bare
mass does, so we can add it to the inertial term in the equation of motion. It contributes an

solutions, as described in the appendix. We ignore these problems in the following discussion,
and in fact they can be avoided by taking the limit in a way that represents the self-force by
a diﬀerence-diﬀerential equation or integro-diﬀerential equation. The remaining terms in the
series (11) vanish in the limit as the particle shrinks to a point.

By analogy we can represent the self-nonelectromagnetic force on the same shell in the form

The equation (13) is limited to one term (we took into account that the ﬁelds of nonelectro-

magnetic origin are not emitted and hence do not produce a radiation reaction).

If we postulate that the external force applied to the ith particle is equal to the sum of
electromagnetic and nonelectromagnetic self-forces and is of opposite direction, then, according
to (11), (13), the equation of motion can be presented in the form accepted in the classical
electrodynamics

and postulate that the obtained value is the observed energy of parti-

cles. This can be called renormalization. It leaves the conservation law (23) in the same form
but now the observed kinetic energy is composed of electromagnetic and nonelectromagnetic
energies determined by masses of energetic origin.

Both the electromagnetic and nonelectromagnetic dynamic masses in the equation of motion
(14) can be considered as coeﬃcients at the resistive terms. They have the dimensions of mass
and their sum agrees with the observable mass. The sum of electromagnetic and nonelectro-
magnetic energetic masses of particles is another form of presentation of the observable mass of
particles based on their energy.

There is still the matter of the 4/3 problem and the energy due to the Poincar´e stresses. In
the nonrelativistic theory we simply ignore the divergent, constant terms in the ﬁeld energy W ,
as discussed above, so the problem disappears. In the relativistic case, however, this energy is
part of the rest energy of the particle. Unfortunately, this energy is only 3/4 what we would
expect from the mass that appears in the momentum. The missing mass, as ﬁrst pointed out by
Poincar´e, is accounted for by considering the forces that hold the electric charge distribution. In
the simplest example, the momentum density of the Poincar´e stresses (the oﬀ-diagonal elements
of the stress 4-tensor) vanish in all coordinate systems, and the energy density is just suﬃcient
to make up the missing mass. More elaborate models of the Poincar´e stress tensor have both
momentum and energy, but when the Poincar´e stresses are included in the symmetric stress
tensor, a covariant form of the conservation law can be derived [4], [5].

To conclude, we have shown a logical inconsistency in the derivation of the energy conserva-
tion law that appears in almost every text on advanced electrodynamics. The conservation law
expressed by (7) - (9) is incorrect as it stands and must be replaced by (23). Unfortunately we
can not state that the correct formulae for the energy conservation law was obtained without any
hypotheses. It is better to say that we proceed from the assumption that the energy conservation
law and Maxwell equations are valid in any case and put limitations on the nonelectromagnetic
ﬁelds.

Appendix

We start by reviewing very brieﬂy the derivation of the rate of change of momentum of the
particle based on Abraham-Lorentz evaluation of the self-force. In the nonrelativistic case, the
equation of motion of a particle in the external ﬁelds can be written in the form

m(bare) dv
dt

= q

E(other) + v × B(other)

+ F(self ),

(25)

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

where m(bare) is the mass of the bare particle (without electromagnetic ﬁelds), E(other) and
B(other) are the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of other particles in the system, and F(self) is the
electromagnetic force of the charge distribution of the particle back on itself. In the nonrela-
tivistic limit we can ignore the eﬀect of the self-magnetic ﬁeld compared to that of the electric
ﬁeld, and the eﬀect of the self-electric ﬁeld can be expressed as an integral over the retarded
self-ﬁeld of the particle of the form

and the retarded time is

t′ = tretarded = t −

c

.

For a rigid charge distribution, the charge density at the retarded time tret is simply related
to that at the present time t by the motion of the center of mass of the particle. If the charge
distribution is small, the retarded times are all close to the present time and we can use a
Taylor-series expansion to evaluate ρ (r′, tret). For a rigid, spherical shell of charge the result is

This is called the Page-Somerfeld equation of motion [9], [10]. Its relativistic generalization is
discussed by Caldirola [11]. For more general charge distributions we get an integro-diﬀerential
equation of motion called the Markov equation [12]. Its relativistic generalization is discussed
by Brau [7].

where the observed mass of the particle is given by (14). The result (33) is called the Abraham-
Lorentz equation of motion [13], [14]. Its relativistic generalization is discussed by Dirac [15].
Unfortunately, this equation admits runaway solutions, for if the external ﬁelds vanish the
equation of motion (33) is satisﬁed by the solution

v (t) = v0et/τ ,

where τ = 2a/3c and v0 is a constant. That is, in the absence of external ﬁelds the particle can
start at rest and accelerate without limit. Runaway solutions are avoided by the Page-Somerfeld
equation of motion and, under certain conditions, by the Markov equation of motion. However,
these equations of motion admit oscillatory solutions [16].

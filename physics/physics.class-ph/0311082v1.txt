A review of electron beam bunching methods is presented. A method to create trains of short electron mi-
crobunches by a creation of an electron multilayer mirror in the longitudinal phase space and then rotating it in
ﬁelds of Radiofrequency (RF) accelerators or Free-Electron Laser (FEL) ampliﬁers is proposed.

1. Introduction

The production of short period trains of elec-
tron bunches (electron multilayer mirrors) is very
important for the solution of the problem of com-
pact, stable, monochromatic, diﬀraction limited
prebunched FELs in the mm to X-ray regions.

Bunched electron beams of length

Prebunched FELs were suggested by V.L.Gins-
burg in 1947 and named ”Sources of Coherent
Undulator Radiation (UR)” [1]. The terms para-
metric and prebunched FELs appeared later [2].
H.Motz performed the ﬁrst experiments on gen-
eration of coherent UR in 1953 [3]. R.M.Phillips
generated stimulated UR in a conventional FEL
in the RF region in 1960 [4]. In the early 1970’s
interest in prebunched FELs was renewed [5], [6].
1
mm are produced in klystron bunchers (KB) and
radio-frequency accelerators [7]. The basic com-
ponents of a KB is an RF cavity followed by a
drift space. The cavity is excited to the T M010
mode. The electron beam at the exit of the
buncher receives sinusoidal energy modulation.
After the drift space the electron beam will be
bunched due to the acquired velocity modulation.
A simple way to produce a bunched beam is to
pass a continuous beam through a chopper, where
the beam is deﬂected across a narrow slit or a sys-
tem of slits, resulting in a pulsed beam behind the
slit. The chopper includes an RF cavity excited
like the buncher cavity but with the beam port
oﬀset by a distance from the cavity axis.

÷

The chopper mode of bunching is rather waste-
ful. An RF buncher, which concentrates electrons
from a large range of phases towards a particu-

lar phase is more eﬃcient for electron bunching.
However, a chopper produces a beam with higher
depth of modulation (clear bunches), does not in-
troduce additional energy spread and can be used
for speciﬁc reasons. Modern choppers work eﬀec-
tively in the RF region [8]. Schemes of choppers
for harder regions can be suggested (see below).

2. Undulator bunchers

Short-period trains of bunches are produced in
undulator klystron bunchers (UKB). The energy
modulation occurs in the undulator and electro-
magnetic wave ﬁelds of the UKB (FEL ampliﬁer
conﬁguration) and bunching takes place in a free
space [4]. The bunching length in UKB can be
shortened if a dispersion section (chicane mag-
net) follows the undulator. Such a system was
called an optical klystron buncher (OKB) [9].
The wavelength of the wave used in UKB is

Undulators with high deﬂection parameters
(wigglers) possess high dispersion.
If the UKB
works in the regime of high deﬂection parameter
and high intensity of the wave (HHKB), the en-
ergy modulation and bunching can occur in the
same undulator [10]. In HHKB a high degree of
bunching occurs if electrons produce a quarter
of a period of phase oscillations. The bunching
1 m in the
length in this case can be short (
optical region, see section 3).

scheme an electron beam is trapped as a whole
in regions less than those limited by separatrices
of the FEL ampliﬁer for about 3/4 of a period
of phase oscillations (see Fig. 1). Clear bunched
beam can be used for high-eﬃciency generation
on the fundamental or higher harmonics in the
same undulator or in an undulator radiator. A
similar scheme of bunching can occur in cases be-
ing developed in [12]-[15].

accelerators [17] and laser wake-ﬁeld accelerators.
Below, a method of electron-beam bunching

and schemes of realization are considered.

3. A Method of Electron Beam Bunching

The proposed method is based on production
of electron beams in the form of trains of electron
bunches, composed in the longitudinal plane in
N energy layers and followed by rotation of the
bunches at a right angle [18]. Rotation converts
the bunches into short-period (cTmb < λL/N )
trains of micro bunches with layers transverse to
the beam propagation (see Fig. 2).

right bucket to a train of micro bunches.

The longitudinal dimension of microbunches
will be determined by the energy spread of layers
and non linearity of phase oscillations. The inﬂu-
ence of the non linearity can be neglected if the
phase length of layers is short (< π).

phase space (ε − ε0, x). The amplitude of the laser

L = 5 m, Bu = 3.103Gs, λw = 1.06 mkm.

A bunching scheme based on extraction of a
series of microbunches from an electron beam lo-
cated in storage ring buckets when an undula-
tor with variable parameters and electromagnetic
wave are used was considered in [16]. Extracted
microbunches stay in the storage ring buckets.

Shock acceleration of electron bunches or trains
of bunches by wavepackets with a longitudinal
component of electric ﬁeld can lead to their com-
pression. Such schemes can be realized in linear

3.1. Arrangement of electron beams with

energy layers

Example 1. A system of electron beams pro-
duced by N electron guns of energy εn = ε0 +
n∆εl can be arranged in one beam with energy
layers by means of a bending magnet (see Fig.
3) [18]. Here n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...N
1, ∆εl is the
interval between energy layers.

−

Example 2. A thin electron beam with ﬁnite en-
ergy spread and low transverse emittance passes
through a dispersive magnet and a metal lattice
with N slits (see Fig. 4). After the lattice, the
electron beam is arranged in N energy layers1.

1More perfect systems of focusing bending magnets and

If the electron beam has a small energy spread
and an energy modulation, then this scheme can
work in a chopper mode at RF, optical and harder
regions.

If the ionization losses of electrons in the
medium of a thin lattice are equal to ∆εl/2, then
electrons of the incoming beam will be arranged
in layers without losses.

If electron RF guns in Examples 1,2 produce
short bunches, the beam at the exit of systems
will be arranged in layers and bunched. The beam
can be bunched at the exit of the bending magnet
as well. After rotation at the bunching frequency,
the beam will be a train of bunches a buncher’s
wavelength apart. Bunches will consist of N mi-
crobunches (see Fig. 2).

an interference lattice in a storage ring at a posi-
tion of low-beta and high dispersion function. A
low-emittance electron beam intersects the lattice
at a 90 degree angle [19].

In this case, the energy losses of electrons de-
pend on their position in the laser beam. Elec-
trons moving in the bright zones of fringes lose
more energy than those in the dark zones. Their
energy (closed orbits) will tend to the energy
(closed orbits) of electrons in the nearest dark
zones if the energy of scattered quanta ¯hωmax ≪
∆εl. As a result, the electron beam will be ar-
ranged in energy layers if the interaction time will
be much less than the period of phase oscillations
of electrons in the storage ring.

More eﬀective interaction of counterpropagat-
ing laser and electron beams can be produced in
straight sections of storage rings if T EMn, 0 laser
mode is used (n > 1).

This scheme of bunching can be realized in
ion storage rings using present-day technology
10 orders higher than
(Rayleigh cross-section is 7
Compton one) [18]. Realization of the electron
version of this scheme depends on the possibility
of storing high-power laser beams in high-ﬁnesse
optical resonators2.

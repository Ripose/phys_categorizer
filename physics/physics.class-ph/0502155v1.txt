Essential spectrum in vibrations of thin shells in
membrane approximation. Propagation of singularities

Alain CAMPBELL ∗

January 12, 2014

ABSTRACT

The spectral problem of thin elastic shells in membrane approximation does not satisfy the
classical properties of compactness and so there exists an essential spectrum. In the ﬁrst
part, we propose to determinate this spectrum and the weakness directions in the shell.
We particularly study the case of homogeneous and isotropic shells with some examples.
In the second part, we consider an elementary model problem to study the propagation of
singularities and their reﬂections at the boundary of the domain. In the last, we study the
problem of propagation for an isotropic cylindrical shell and we show that the equation of
propagation does not depend on the Poisson coeﬃcient.

1 Introduction

1.1 Classical and non classical vibrating problems in shell theory

We consider a thin shell with a middle surface S. This surface is described by the map,

y = (y1, y2)

Ω

r(y1, y2)

R3

(1)

∈

→
where Ω is a domain of the plane. Let u(y) = (u1(y), u2(y), u3(y)) be the displacement vector
of the surface and its covariant components. We introduce the Hilbert space H = (L(Ω))3
and we denote by (u, v) the scalar product. The displacement u belongs to the subset
V1 = H 1(Ω)
H 2(Ω) which can be modiﬁed to take boundary conditions in account.
The variational form of the problem of vibrations is (cf.[12, ch. VI]),

The bilinear forms am and af correspond respectively to the membrane problem and the
ﬂexion problem. They are continuous on V1. We denote by λ the spectral parameter. This
problem is classical with a selfadjoint operator and compact resolvent and so there exists a
sequence of eigenvalues

O < λ0 ≤
with orthogonal modes (cf.[12, ch.I]).

If the relative thickness of the shell, ǫ, is very small, then the membrane approximation is
an appropriate representation. The formulation of this problem is diﬀerent. In this case, u
belongs to the space V = H 1(Ω)
L2(Ω). The inclusion of V in H is dense and
continuous but is not compact. The problem is written as,

H 1(Ω)

We search for u

V so that,

V, am(u, v) = λ(u, v)

This spectral problem is an elliptic system with mixed order. The classical properties of
compactness are not satisﬁed and the spectrum both contains a sequence of eigenvalues
depending on the domain, and an essential spectrum.

1.2 Essential spectrum

Let H be a Hilbert space and A a selfadjoint operator. The resolvent set is deﬁned by,

Its complement, the spectrum Σ(A), is constituted,

ρ(A) =

ζ / (A

{

−1

ζId)

}

- of isolated eigenvalues of ﬁnite multiplicity; for these ζ, (A

ζId)−1 does not exist.

−

- of other values for which (A

(H). They
are eigenvalues of inﬁnite multiplicity, accumulation points of eigenvalues and continuous
spectrum.

ζId)−1 exists but does not belong to

−

L

The set of these ζ which are not isolated eigenvalues of ﬁnite multiplicity is the essential
spectrum Σess(A).

It can be characterized as the set of ζ for which there exists a sequence (uk) called Weyl’s
sequence so that,

0 in H weakly
0 in H strongly

For very small data, we can obtain a large response and so these sequences can be physi-
cally interpreted as some kind of resonance. This local phenomena are quick oscillations in
some directions which are called weakness directions. We will see that the singularities will
propagate along directions which are orthogonal to these weakness ones.

In the ﬁrst part of this paper, we study the essential spectrum of a vibrating shell in mem-
brane approximation. We show how it is possible to determine this set and the correspond-
ing weakness directions and we give some examples. In the second part, we introduce a non
classical model problem and its essential spectrum and we investigate the propagation and
reﬂection of singularities. Finally, in the last part, we study these problems for a vibrating
cylindrical shell.

By replacing the expressions (13) of T αβ in (10), we obtain an explicit spectral problem
on the displacement u. There appears derivatives of second order in u1 and u2 and of ﬁrst
order in u3. The classical properties of compactness are not satisﬁed and there exists an
essential spectrum. We have weakness directions noted by (ξ1, ξ2) and the orthogonal ones
(x1, x2) will be the directions of propagation of the singularities. The values of λ and (ξ1, ξ2)
correspond to the non-ellipticity of the system in the Douglis and Nirenberg sense (cf.[11
ch. III] [5]). In this spectral problem, we have three equations corresponding to (10). The
equation i is of order (si + sj) in the variable uj with s1 = s2 = 1 and s3 = 0.
To determine λ and (ξ1, ξ2), we write that they are solutions of the equation we obtain by
writing that the determinant of the principal symbol is zero:

By noting that λ is a quotient of two quadratic forms in X = (x2

λ =

Σess ⊂

[0, B33] = [0, aαβζηbαβbζη]

We note that 0 is reached in every hyperbolic point of the shell but not in elliptic ones as it
is easily seen from (19). Moreover, there are some cases for which B33 is not reached. For
instance, if we consider an isotropic cylindrical shell (x1 = Ry1; x2 = Rcosy2; x3 = Rsiny2),
then we have

Let us now consider the case of an isotropic shell. The elasticity coeﬃcients are given by,

and then they disappear because we go out of the essential spectrum.

3 Propagation of singularities in a model problem

The equations of vibrating elastic thin shells in membrane approximation are rather com-
plicated. So to give a good idea about the properties of propagation of singularities we will
ﬁrst study a model problem (cf.[13]) and then we will look at the case of a particular shell.
We consider the following spectral problem,

∆u1 + bu2,2 −
−
bu1,2 + cu2 −
−

(cid:26)

λu1 = f1
λu2 = f2

(36)

where the unknowns (u1, u2) are functions of the two variables y = (y1, y2) in a domain Ω
of the plane. We suppose that b and c are given real numbers and f = (f1, f2) is a right-
hand side which will be deﬁned later. The boundary conditions are for example Dirichlet
conditions u1 = 0 on the boundary ∂Ω.

3.1 Essential spectrum

We deﬁne the spaces H = L2(Ω)
problem in the form,

L2(Ω) and V = H 1

0 (Ω)

L2(Ω) and we can write the

×

(A

λ)u = f

−

(37)

where A is a selfadjoint operator in H.
The problem involves derivatives of second order in u1 and of ﬁrst in u2. This problem of
mixed order does not satisfy the classical properties of compactness (obviously the inclusion
of V in H is not compact). We determine the essential spectrum by writing that this
problem is not elliptic in the sense of Douglis and Nirenberg. We have two equations and
two unknowns and the indices are s1 = 1 and s2 = 0 (cf.[11 ch. III], [5]). We look for the
existence of a nonzero real vector (ξ1, ξ2) so that the determinant of the principal symbol

In general, the set of eigenvalues of a selfadjoint operator in a Hilbert separable space is denu-
merable and the corresponding eigenvectors are orthogonal. So, in particular, the eigenvalues
of A contained in the essential spectrum have measure zero.

Let us consider for instance that Ω is the square [
edge. The functions,

sections of a straight line and a hyperbola (see (41)). One of them is in ]c

important than in the case when λ is out of the essential spectrum and moreover we saw

3.3 Reﬂection of the singularities

The propagation of singularities is characterized by U 1

line which cuts the edges of the domain in two points. So we will have two conditions to
determine only one constant C. It shows that the singularity will not disappear by reaching
a point P on ∂Ω. We will have a reﬂection on another characteristic the slope of which is

We denote by φ the polar angle of ~n in the plane (y1, y2) and (n,t) are the coordinates of a
point in this local referential. By shifting the origin of y in P , we have y1 = tsinφ + ncosφ

R2 ]. Denoting by λ a value in the essential spectrum

The equations of the vibrating shell in the membrane approximation are,

where u1, u2 and u3 are the contravariant components of the displacement and T αβ, those

The previous calculus are not valid if m = tanθ and then λ are equal to zero. In that case
which is the static case, the propagation of singularities is rather diﬀerent (see [8], [9]) and
there is no reﬂection (cf. [7]).

That study of the propagation of singularities has been done in a particular case of isotropic
shell. The equations of vibration of a cylindrical shell have constant coeﬃcients and then
the propagations are along straight lines. The general case is more complicated:
The segments which constitute the essential spectrum could be diﬀerent in every point of the
surface S. The characteristic curves are some pieces of curves and the propagations along
them would depend on the reached point. For example, it is conceivable that the value of
the spectral parameter which is given, will be go out of the essential spectrum in some point
and that the propagation will stop.
Moreover, if some propagation reaches a hyperbolic point at the edge of a shell with four
directions of propagation, then we will have several possibilities for the reﬂection and we do
not know what will happen.

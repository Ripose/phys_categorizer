1. The aim of this Letter is to illustrate the remarkable internal consistency of 1932

Miller’s cosmic solution for the Earth’s motion. This was deduced from the data obtained

with his Michelson-Morley interferometer [1] on the base of the theory exposed by Nassau

and Morse [2]. In this way, from the variations of the magnitude and azimuth of the ether-

drift eﬀect with the sidereal time, one can determine the apex [3] of the motion of the solar

system. By requiring consistency among the determinations obtained in four epochs of the

year (see Fig.23 of ref.[1]), Miller obtained values for the Earth’s velocity lying in the range

200-215 km/s (see page 233 of ref.[1]) with the conclusion that ”...a velocity

vearth

208 km/s

∼

(1)

for the cosmic component, gives the closest grouping of the four independently determined

locations of the cosmic apex”.

In this context, it is essential to stress that the fringe shifts observed in the classical exper-

iment of Michelson-Morley [4] (and in the subsequent one of Morley and Miller [5]) although

smaller than the expected magnitude corresponding to the orbital motion of the Earth, were

not negligibly small. While this had already been pointed out by Hicks [6], Miller’s reﬁned

analysis of the half-period, second-harmonic eﬀect observed in the experimental fringe shifts

showed that they were consistent with an eﬀective velocity lying in the range 7-10 km/s (see

Fig.4 of ref.[1]). For instance, the Michelson-Morley experiment gave a value

8.8 km/s for

the noon observations and a value

8.0 km/s for the evening observations. By including

∼

Miller’s Mount Wilson results, whose typical eﬀective velocities were also lying in the range

7-11 km/s (see Fig. 22 of ref.[1]), one concludes that all classical ether-drift experiments were

∼

consistent with an ‘observable’ velocity

The problem with Miller’s analysis was to understand the large discrepancy between Eq.(1),

as needed to describe the variations of the ether-drift eﬀect at diﬀerent sidereal times, and

Eq.(2), as determined by the magnitude of the fringe shifts themselves.

It has been recently pointed out by Cahill and Kitto [7] that an eﬀective reduction of the

Earth’s velocity from values vearth =

(102) km/s down to values vobs =

(1) km/s can be

understood by taking into account the eﬀects of the Lorentz contraction and of the refractive

In this way, the observations become consistent [7] with values of the Earth’s velocity

that are comparable to vearth

369 km/s as extracted by ﬁtting the COBE data for the

This would also explain why the experiments of Illingworth [9] ( performed in an appa-

ratus ﬁlled with helium where

In the following, I shall re-formulate the argument using Lorentz transformations. As a
matter of fact, in this case there is a non-trivial diﬀerence of a factor √3 that makes Miller’s

solution Eq.(1) entirely consistent with Eq.(2).

2. As a ﬁrst step, I’ll start from the idea that light propagates in a medium with refractive

The basic question is to determine experimentally, and to a high degree of accuracy, whether
light propagates isotropically with velocity Eq.(4) for an observer S′ placed on the Earth.

we require, however, a higher level of accuracy, say 10−9, the only way to test isotropy is to
perform a Michelson-Morley type of experiment and look for fringe shifts upon rotation of

the interferometer.

Now, if one ﬁnds experimentally fringe shifts (and thus some non-zero anisotropy), one

can explore the possibility that this eﬀect is due to the Earth’s motion with respect to a
= S′. In this perspective, light would propagate isotropically with velocity

preferred frame Σ
as in Eq.(4) for Σ but not for S′.

Assuming this scenario, the degree of anisotropy for S′ can easily be determined by
using Lorentz transformations. By deﬁning v the velocity of S′ with respect to Σ one ﬁnds

The above results will be useful in the following.

Let us now address the theory of the Michelson-Morley interferometer by considering

two light beams, say 1 and 2, that for simplicity are chosen perpendicular in Σ where they

propagate along the x and y axis with velocities ux(1) = uy(2) = u =
Nmedium . Let us also
assume that the velocity v of S′ is along the x axis. In this case, to evaluate the velocities of
1 and 2 for S′, we can apply Lorentz transformations with the result

P is
taken along the direction of motion associated with the beam 1 while the arm of length L′

lies along the direction of the beam 2. Notice that the two arms, in the S′ frame, form an
angle that diﬀers from 90o by

3. Now, upon operation of the interferometer, one is faced with several alternatives:

i) there are no fringe shifts at all. This corresponds to the usual point of view that

light propagates isotropically on the Earth so that S′

ii) there are fringe shifts but their magnitude turns out to be unrelated to any meaningful

deﬁnition of the Earth’s velocity ( think for instance of some anisotropy due to the Earth’s

Case iii) would represent experimental evidence for the existence of a preferred frame

369 km/s obtained from

that the classical experiments are consistent with the value vearth

However, in our expression Eq.(20) determining the fringe shifts there is a diﬀerence of a
factor √3 with respect to their result vobs = v√kmedium. Therefore, using Eqs.(2) and (20),

This is completely consistent with the value Eq.(1) obtained by Miller from the variations of

the magnitude and of the azimuth of the ether-drift eﬀect with the sidereal time on the base

of the theory of Nassau and Morse [2].

4. Still today, the original Michelson-Morley experiment of 1887 [4] is considered a proof

that absolute motion cannot be detected. Actually, the results of that experiment were smaller

than expected but non-zero. As pointed out by Cahill and Kitto [7], the key-ingredient to

understand the reduction from values vearth =

(102) km/s down to values vobs =

km/s, consists in taking into account the Lorentz contraction and the refractive index of the

dielectric medium ﬁlling the arms of the interferometer. However, a full treatment on the
base of Lorentz transformations introduces a factor √3 with respect to their analysis. As a

consequence the relevant value of the Earth’s velocity is not vearth

369 km/s but rather

∼

216 km/s. This value, which is completely consistent with Miller’s determination

vearth

∼

Eq.(1), suggests that the magnitude of the fringe shifts is determined by the typical velocity

of the solar system within our galaxy and not, for instance, by the velocity of the solar system

relatively to the centroid of the Local Group. In the latter case, one would get higher values

Notice that such ambiguities, say vearth

200, 300, 369, ... km/s, on the actual value of

∼
the Earth’s velocity determining the fringe shifts, can only be resolved experimentally in view

of the many theoretical uncertainties in the operative deﬁnition of the preferred frame where

light propagates isotropically. At this stage, I believe, one should just concentrate on the

internal consistency of the various frameworks. In this sense, the simple relativistic analysis

presented in this Letter shows that this is certainly true for Miller’s 1932 solution.

I am aware that my conclusion goes against the widely spread belief that Miller’s results

were only due to statistical ﬂuctuations and/or local temperature conditions (see the Abstract

of ref.[19]). However, it is also true that the same authors of ref.[19] were admitting that

”...there can be little doubt that statistical ﬂuctuations alone cannot account for the periodic

fringe shifts observed by Miller” (see page 171 of ref.[19]). Even more, although ”...there is

obviously considerable scatter in the data at each azimuth position...the average values...show

a marked second harmonic eﬀect” (see page 171 of ref.[19]). In any case, interpreting the

observed eﬀects on the base of the local temperature conditions is certainly not the only

solution since ”...we must admit that a direct and general quantitative correlation between

amplitude and phase of the observed second harmonic on the one hand and the thermal

conditions in the observation hut on the other hand could not be established” (see page 175

of ref.[19]). This unsatisfactory explanation should instead be compared with the excellent

agreement that was obtained by Miller once the ﬁnal parameters for the Earth’s velocity

were plugged in the theoretical predictions (see Figs. 26 and 27 of ref.[1]). Finally, it seems

appropriate to remark that Miller’s experiments represented the most reﬁned version of that

‘interferometric art’ initiated by Michelson and Morley. There is some inner contradiction

in concluding that Miller was simply wrong in 1932 but Michelson and Morley, nevertheless,

performed in 1887 an experiment that changed the history of physics.

5. I conclude with a brief comparison with present-day, ‘vacuum’ Michelson-Morley ex-

periments of the type ﬁrst performed by Brillet and Hall [20] and more recently by M¨uller

et al.

[21]. In this case, by deﬁnition

vacuum = 1 so that vobs = 0 and no anisotropy can

be detected. However, as anticipated above, one can explore [11, 12] the possibility that,

N

even in this case, a very small anisotropy might be due to a refractive index

vacuum that

diﬀers from unity by an inﬁnitesimal amount. In this case, the natural candidate to explain

N

N

vacuum

a value
= 1 is gravity. In fact, by using the Equivalence Principle, any freely falling
frame S′ will locally measure the same speed of light as in an inertial frame in the absence
of any gravitational eﬀects. However, if S′ carries on board an heavy object this is no longer
true. For an observer placed on the Earth, this amounts to insert the Earth’s gravitational

potential in the weak-ﬁeld isotropic approximation to the line element of General Relativity

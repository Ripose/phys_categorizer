ABSTRACT: Negative real parts of the permittivity and permeability lead an

isotropic chiral medium to exhibit circular dichroism that is reversed with respect

to that exhibited by an identical medium but the real parts of whose permittivity

Key words: chiral medium; circular dichroism; negative real permeability; negative

and permeability are positive.

1 Introduction

The Drude–Born–Fedorov constitutive relations of a homogeneous, isotropic chiral

medium (ICM) are stated as [1]

D(r, ω) = ǫ(ω) [E(r, ω) + β(ω)

E(r, ω)]

B(r, ω) = µ(ω) [H(r, ω) + β(ω)

H(r, ω)]



The permittivity of the ICM is denoted by ǫ(ω), and its permeability by µ(ω),

whilst β(ω) is the chirality parameter. An exp(

iωt) time–dependence is implicit

throughout and the dependences on the angular frequency ω are understood from

here onwards.

When a linearly polarized plane wave is normally incident on an ICM slab of

inﬁnite lateral dimensions, the transmitted plane wave is elliptically polarized with

its vibration ellipse rotated with respect to direction of the incident electric ﬁeld

phasor [2, 3]. These two eﬀects are quantiﬁed via the optical rotation δ and the

circular dichroism ψ, expressed on a per–unit–thickness basis as [4]

where the wavenumbers

which appears in the decomposition of the electric and the magnetic ﬁeld phasors

in terms of Beltrami ﬁelds [1].

Typically, β is a small parameter that appears to manifest chieﬂy via δ and ψ.

The inﬂuence of β is immediately obvious from (3) and (4): a change in its sign

results in the interchange of the values of the two wavenumbers, which thus reverses

the signs of both the optical rotation and the circular dichroism [1]. Pairs of mediums

diﬀering only in β and/or in η have been contrasted earlier in this journal [5, 6].

The objective of the present communication is to present the observable con-

sequences of a very recent development on isotropic chiral mediums: Shelby et al.

have constructed and tested a dielectric/magnetic composite material which appears

to possess permeability and permittivity with negative real parts in a particular

frequency range [7]. Although their material is not exactly as advertised, future

possibilities mandate the examination of observable repercussions on ICMs.

2 Analysis

Let us consider electromagnetic ﬁeld phasors in an ICM at a frequency that does

not lie in an absorption band [4]. Accordingly,

Re [γ1,2]). The upper signs in the foregoing

equations hold for the normal case, the lower for the case suggested by the exper-

imental results of Shelby et al. [7]. The permeability and the permittivity of free

space are denoted, respectively, by µ0 and ǫ0.

Correct to the ﬁrst order in both tan δǫ and tan δµ, we obtain

3 Conclusions

Equation (9) shows that the optical rotation remains unaﬀected if the real parts of

both the permittivity and the permeability change signs, but the circular dichroism

reverses in sign. This conclusion holds provided Im [β] can be ignored, i.e, at fre-

quencies away from a circular dichroism band [4]. Otherwise, optical rotation is also

aﬀected. Equation (10) shows that only the imaginary part of η changes sign, if the

signs of the real parts of both the permittivity and the permeability are altered.

Suppose two ICMs labeled p and q possess identical response properties at a

certain frequency — except that 0 < Re [ǫp] =

Re [ǫq] and 0 < Re [µp] =

Re [µq].

Correct to the zeroth order in both tan δǫ and tan δµ, the two ICMs are isoimpedant

as well as isorefractive; yet, they could be distinguished from each other by employing

obliquely incident plane waves. Of course, (9) and (10) show that the two ICMs are

neither isoimpedant nor isorefractive, correct to the ﬁrst order in tan δǫ and tan δµ.

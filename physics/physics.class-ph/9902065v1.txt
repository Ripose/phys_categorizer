The derivation of the Darvin Lagrangian is reconsidered. Some errors made by founder and
adopted by repetition are corrected. It was shown that the solutions of the equations of motion
deﬁned by the Darvin Lagrangian which are considered to be correct to the order of 1/c2 inclusive
in some cases contradict to the energy conservation law in the approximation under consideration.

Darvin Lagrangian for interacting particles is an approximate one ﬁrst derived by Darvin in 1920 [1]. This La-
grangian is considered to be correct to the order of 1/c2 inclusive [2], [3], [4]. To this order, we can eliminate the
radiation modes from the theory and describe the interaction of charged particles in pure action-at-a-distance terms.
Although the Darwin Lagrangian has had its most celebrated application in the quantum-mechanical context of the
Breit interaction, it has uses in the purely classical domain [3], [5]. In this paper we explore some surprising conse-
quences of the retardation eﬀects of Maxwell’s electrodynamics to a system of charged particles. The speciﬁc cases
of two and three interacting particles are considered in the framework of classical electrodynamics. We show that
the solutions of the equations of motion deﬁned by the Darvin Lagrangian in some cases contradict to the energy
conservation law in the approximation under consideration.

Below we will present the detailed and typical derivation of the Darvin Lagrangian for a system of charged particles
to correct some error made by founder and adopted by repetition. Then we will show that the solutions of the
equations of motion deﬁned by the Darvin Lagrangian in some cases contradict to the energy conservation law.

The Lagrangian for a charge ea in the external ﬁeld of the another charge eb is

La = −mac2/γa − eaφb +

~Ab · ~va,

ea
c

where ma is the mass of the particle a, c the light velocity, γa = 1/p1 − β2
a relativistic factor of the particle a,
βa = |~va/c|, ~va the velocity of the particle a, φb and ~Ab the scalar and vector retarded potentials produced by the
particle b.

The scalar and vector potentials of the ﬁeld produced by the charge b at the position of the charge a can be expressed
in terms of the coordinates and velocities of the charge b (for φb to the terms of order (vb/c)2, and for ~Ab, to terms
(v/c) [2]

φb =

~Ab =

,

where Rab = | ~Rab|, ~Rab = ~Ra − ~Rb, ~Ra and ~Rb are the radius-vectors of the particles a, b respectively.

Substituting these expressions in (1), we obtain the Lagrangian La for the charge ea (for a ﬁxed motion of the other

charges eb). The Lagrangian of the total system of particles is

L = Lp + Lint,

where the Lagrangian of the system of free particles Lp and the Lagrangian of the interaction of particles Lint are

The equation of motion of a particle a is described by the equation d ~Pa/dt = ∂L/∂ ~Ra, where ~Pα = ∂L/∂~va is the
canonical momentum of the particle. This equation according to (3) can be presented in the form (see the Appendix)

where ~pa = maγa~va is the momentum of the particle a.

The Hamiltonian of a system of charges in the same approximation must be done by the general rule for calculating

H from L (H = ~va ~Pa − L). According to (3) (see Appendix) the value

The constant value Pa mac2 in (5) can be omitted. Here we would like to note that contrary to [1] - [3] and other
papers the last items in the term H int of the equation (5) has the positive sign and the momentum ~pa = maγa~va
includes γ- factor of the particle (γ ≃ 1 + β2/2 + 3β4/8). This is because of e.g.
in [2] the Hamiltonian was done
non-consistently through connection of small corrections to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian.

The Lagrangian (3) does not depend on time. That is why the Hamiltonian (5) is the energy of the system.
Further we consider a special case when particles are moving along the axis x (see Fig.1). In this case the Lagrangian

and Hamiltonian of the system of particles are described by the expressions

The x-component of the force applied to the particle a from the particle b according to (4) in this case is dpa/dt =
eaeb/R2
b − eaeb ˙βb/cRab. This force corresponds to the electric ﬁeld strength ~Eb = −∇φb − (1/c)(∂ ~Ab/∂t) produced
by the particle b and determined by the equation (2). As was to be expected in the case of the uniform movement
of the particle b (e.g. the case mb ≫ ma) the electric ﬁeld strength produced by the particle b in the direction of it’s
movement is γ2

b times less then in the state of rest.

Next we consider the dynamics of three particles a, b, d according to the Darvin Lagrangian and Hamiltonian. Let
particles a, b have charges ea = eb = e masses ma = mb = m and velocities va = −vb = v = cβ. The particle d is
located at the position x = 0 at rest (vd = 0) its charge and mass are q, M .

In this case the Hamiltonian is the energy of the system which according to (7) can be presented in the form

γ0 = M c

where γ0 is the initial relativistic factor of the particles a, b corresponding to the limit R → ∞, R = | ~Ra| the distance
between the particle a and the origin of the coordinate system.

It follows from the equation (8) the dependence between the γ− factor of the particles a, b and the distance R

We can see that in the case of q > −e2/4γ2 the turning point exist at which p = v = 0 and γ = 1. According to

(8) the minimal distance between particle a and the origin of the coordinate system

(10)

where T0 is the initial kinetic energy of the particle a.

The retardation does not lead to the violation of the energy conservation law in this case, as the term in the electric
ﬁeld strength and in the force (4) which is determined by the acceleration will compensate the decrease of the repulsive
forces corresponding to the uniformly moving particles.

Fig.1. A scheme of two particle interaction.

In the case q = −e/4γ2 according to (4), (7) the particles a, b are moving uniformly ( ˙β = 0, v = v0, γ = γ0). In
this case particles can reach the distance R = x = 0, which is not reachable for them under the condition of the same
energy expense 2T0 when a non-relativistic bringing closer of the particles takes place. This conclusion is valid in the
arbitrary relativistic case as in this case there is no emission of the electromagnetic radiation.

In the case −e/4 < q < −e/4γ2 the particles a, b will be brought closer under the condition of the acceleration
by attractive forces and ”fall in” toward each other. At the same time under such value of charge q of the particle
d in the non-relativistic case the particles will repel each other such a way that the position R = x = 0 will not be
reachable for them if the same energy expense 2T0 will be used for bringing closer of the particles.

In the case q < −e/4 the particles will acquire the higher value of the energy then necessary for non-relativistic
separation of the particles. The acquired energy can be transformed to another forms of energy (heat, radiation)
by the extraneous forces. The particles can be stopped by these forces at some distance between them and then
separated. Some gain of energy will take place.

This curious result is the reminiscent of the non-consistency of the classical Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics. The

existence of this solution is a genuine eﬀect of electrodynamics with retardation.

The canonical momentum of the particle a is

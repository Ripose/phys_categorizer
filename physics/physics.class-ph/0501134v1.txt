The relativistic conservation law involving the center of energy is reviewed and illustrated using

simple examples from classical electromagnetic theory. It is emphasized that this conservation law

is parallel to the conservation laws for energy, linear momentum, and energy, in arising from the

generators of the Poincare group for electromagnetic theory; yet this relativistic law reﬂecting the

continuous ﬂow of energy goes virtually unmentioned in the text books. The illustrations here

present situations both where external forces are present and are absent. The cases of a parallel

plate capacitor, a ﬂattened slip-joint solenoid, and two interacting charges are included.

INTRODUCTION

Classical electrodynamics, like any other relativistic Lagrangian ﬁeld theory, is invariant

under the Poincare group involving the operations of spacetime translation, spatial rotation,

and proper Lorentz transformation. The associated inﬁnitesimal generators,[1] designated

by P, U, L, and U

−→
X , are associated with conserved quantities.

The generator P of

space translations is associated with conservation of linear momentum. The generator U

of time translations is associated with conservation of energy. The generator L of spatial

rotations is associated with conservation of angular momentum. The generator U

−→
X of

proper Lorentz transformations is associated with the uniform motion of the system center

of energy.[2] Although the conservation laws of linear momentum, angular momentum, and

energy are illustrated by ﬁne elementary examples in electromagnetism text books,[3] this

does not seem to be the case for the uniform motion of the center of energy.[4] The invariant

motion of the center of energy is well[5] but not widely known, and is rarely illustrated

with examples in the electromagnetism literature. The law expresses the continuous ﬂow of

energy in relativistic systems.

In this article we review the relativistic law for the invariant

motion of the center of energy and then present three simple electromagnetic examples: a

parallel-plate capacitor, a ﬂattened, slip-joint solenoid, and two interacting point charges.

The examples remind us that when calculating the center of energy of an electromagnetic

system, relativistic particle equations of motion must be used and all the energy must be

considered, including the particle rest energy and kinetic energy, and the distributed energy

stored in the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

i /c2)−1/2,
−→
X is the center of energy of the sys-

tem. These correspond to the generators respectively of space translation, time translation,

spatial rotation, and proper Lorentz transformation.

In the absence of external forces, the

ﬁrst three quantities are time-independent and the fourth has a constant time derivative.

The electromagnetic expressions in the ﬁrst three equations appear in the electromagnetism

textbooks, whereas the last is usually absent. On account of this omission, we will sketch

the derivation of the center of energy expression.

B. Derivation of the Center-of-Energy Law

The center of energy

X in Eq. (4) is analogous to the familiar center of (rest) mass

except that all energy contributes. The total energy U in Eq. (2) for a system of charged

particles and electromagnetic ﬁelds is the sum of the relativistic mechanical energy of each
particle miγic2 and the electromagnetic ﬁeld energy found by integrating the energy density
u = [1/(8π)](E2 +B2) over all space. The center-of-energy expression (4) involves weighting

the displacement r by the amount of the energy located at r. Thus a point mass of
energy miγic2 contributes ri(miγic2) while the electromagnetic energy u d3r in a diﬀerential
volume d3r contributes r(u d3r) = r[1/(8π)](E2 + B2)d3r. Summing over the particles and

integrating over all the electromagnetic ﬁelds in space, we obtain the expression (4) for the

energy times the center of energy U

−→
X .

The derivation of the law for the invariant motion of the center of energy in electromag-

netic theory can be given in a fashion parallel to that given for Poynting’s theorem.[6] We

3

consider the integral over all space of

d3r r (J · E) which represents the volume-integral

over the displacement r weighted by J · E, the local transfer of power from electromagnetic

Z

form over to some other form due to the forces produced by electric ﬁelds on moving charges.

Just as for Poynting’s theorem, we use Maxwell’s equations to rewrite this integral in terms

of the electromagnetic ﬁelds alone,

C. Conservation Laws in the Presence of External Forces on Particles

In many cases it is convenient to consider not isolated electromagnetic systems but rather

electromagnetic systems in interaction with external forces Fext i acting on the particles of the

system.

In this case the conservation ideas are changed for all the conservation laws. The

the sum of the external forces gives the time-rate-of-change of the system linear momentum

The power delivered by the external forces gives the time-rate-of-change of the system energy

The sum of the external torques gives the time-rate-of-change of the system angular mo-

mentum L (about the origin)

The law for the change in the energy times the center of energy seems unfamiliar.[7] We can
obtain the rule by using the modiﬁed equation of energy transfer d(miγic2)/dt = [qiE(ri, t)+
Fext i] · vi for the i-th particle (multiplied by ri)

ri

(miγic2) = ri(Fext i · vi) + ri(qiE · vi)

and summing over all the particles

(miγic2) =

Now using Eq. (13) for

d3r r(J · E) in Eq. (6) and noting the ﬁrst two lines of Eq. (7),

we obtain the rule for the center of energy,

Thus the power weighted by the position where the power is delivered equals the time-rate-
of-change of the system energy times the center of energy minus c2 times the system linear

momentum. All of the laws (9)-(11), (14) can be integrated with respect to time so as to

give integral forms. The integral form for the relativistic center-of-energy law in (14) is

In special relativity, the ﬂow of energy has a continuous meaning. Thus the introduction

of energy by external forces located at points in space changes the center of energy of the

system.

The continuous ﬂow of energy in space for relativistic systems is in contrast with the

situation in nonrelativistic mechanics where energy can be suddenly transported from one

point in space to another. Thus in nonrelativistic mechanics a long, massless, rigid pole

can be used to transport energy instantaneously from one end of the pole to the other.

Such poles do not exist in relativistic physics. Rather, in relativistic physics a system has

a well-deﬁned center of energy which moves through space continuously at a speed (in the

absence of external forces) not exceeding the speed of light in vacuum c.

It is interesting to note the nonrelativistic limit for the center-of-energy relations in Eqs.
If we divide by a factor of c2 and allow c → ∞, then all that remains of

(4), (7) and (14).
the energy given in Eq. (2) is the rest-mass contribution U/c2 →

mi with no contribution

from the (ﬁnite) kinetic energy or electromagnetic energy. Thus in the c → ∞ limit, Eq.

i

(4) becomes the expression for the center of rest mass given in Eq. (5). Also, equation

(7) becomes the statement that the total rest mass times the center of rest mass equals the

momentum

(16)

These are familiar results in Galilean-invariant (nonrelativistic) mechanics. On dividing Eq.
(14) by c2 and allowing c → ∞, the left-hand side involving external forces vanishes entirely

and the right-hand side involves simply the same statement in Eq. (16) obtained from the

c → ∞ limit of Eq. (7). Within nonrelativistic physics, there is a continuous ﬂow of rest

mass but not of energy. Thus in nonrelativistic physics there is no separate law regarding

the location where energy is introduced into the system.

ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE CENTER-OF-ENERGY CONSERVATION LAW

A. Quasi-static Changes for Stationary Systems

1. A Single Point Mass

As the simplest possible example of the relativistic conservation laws for stationary

systems, we consider a single point mass m at rest at displacement r in some inertial frame.
The conserved quantities associated with Poincare invariance then involve energy U = mc2,

linear momentum P = 0, angular momentum about the origin L = 0, and energy times
−→
X = mc2r. We now use an external force Fext to move the mass
center of energy (mc2)
from r to r′ quasi-statically. Since the external force can be chosen arbitrarily small, there is

no linear impulse delivered, no net work done, no angular impulse, and no moment-of-work

done. The only conservation law with some non-vanishing terms is the fourth involving the

center of energy. Here the system linear momentum has a nonvanishing time-intergral so

that the integral form of the law in Eq. (15) gives

0 = (mc2r′) − (mc2r) − c2

which is consistent with the momentum of a particle

P =

1 − [(dr/dt)/c]2

(quasi-static)

(18)

We notice that even though the linear momentum P can be made as small as desired by

p

taking the external forces suﬃciently small, the time integral of the linear momentum gives

a ﬁnite non-zero value independent of the magnitude of the small external force in the limit

dr/dt → 0. The change in the position of the system center of energy was associated with

a ﬂow of momentum as required by special relativity.

In this simplest case where all of the energy is rest-mass energy, we could actually have
divided Eq. (17) through by c2 and have obtained a result valid in nonrelativistic physics

where the linear momentum is given by exactly p = mv.

In nonrelativistic physics, the

change in rest mass position is continuous and is associated with the ﬂow of linear momen-

tum.

2. Parallel Plate Capacitor

A parallel-plate capacitor provides a simple illustration of the conservation law for the

center of energy when electrostatic energy is involved. The electrostatic energy contributes

to the center of energy of the system in relativistic physics, whereas it does not contribute

to the center of rest mass which appears in nonrelativistic physics. We consider a capacitor

consisting of two parallel conducting plates, each of dimension L × L, the left-hand plate

of mass m in the plane with x-coordinate x, and the right-hand plate of mass M in the

plane with x-coordinate X.

In this section discussing quasi-static displacement, we will

take the masses m and M as negligible. The plates are centered so that the x-axis passes

through the center of each plate. Plate m is charged with total charge +Q and plate M with

charge −Q. It is assumed that the plates form a parallel-plate capacitor of small separation

0 < X − x << L with an electric ﬁeld given by the electrostatic expression

E =

i4πQ/L2

(19)

between the plates. There is no magnetic ﬁeld present and it is assumed that we may

b

neglect the fringing ﬁelds outside the plates.

In order to maintain the capacitor plates at rest, there must be external forces[8] Fextm =
−Q(E + 0)/2 = −2πQ2/L2 = −FextM on the left-hand plate of negligible rest mass m at x

and on the right-hand plate of negligible rest mass M at X respectively. The illustration

of energy conservation for this situation is easily carried out.[9] Thus if the two plates are
displaced quasi-statically from x to x′ and from X to X ′ respectively, the work done by the

external forces of constraint is found to equal the change in electrostatic energy

Fextm(x′ − x) + FextM (X ′ − X) =

[−(x′ − x) + (X ′ − X)]

However, in contrast to the work-energy law, the relativistic center-of-energy law in Eq.

(15) usually goes unmentioned. On quasi-static displacement of the plates, there is no

magnetic ﬁeld generated in the region between the plates and therefore no electromagnetic

ﬁeld momentum between the plates.

If the plates are displaced quasi-statically from x to

After rearrangement, equations (21) and (22) are seen to involve the same quantities on the

right-hand sides. Thus indeed moving the capacitor plates illustrates the relativistic center-

of-energy law (15) with external forces. Thus the energy introduced by the external forces

at the plates provides not only the change in electrostatic energy but also the continuous

motion of the center of electrostatic energy.

3. Flattened, Slip-Joint Solenoid

It was pointed out recently[9] that energy calculations for a solenoid can be made analo-

gous to those for a parallel-plate capacitor by ﬂattening the solenoid and ﬁtting it with slip

joints which allow relative motion of the front and back current sheets while maintaining

the continuity of the circulating surface currents. Here we will use this solenoidal conﬁgu-

ration to carry out calculations for a solenoid which are analogous to those given above for

a capacitor.

The ﬂattened solenoid consists of two large perfectly-conducting plates of size L × l

with negligible masses m and M located in the planes x and X respectively and connected

through short perfectly-conducting sides parallel to the yz-plane which are ﬁtted with slip

joints. The slip joints maintain the continuity of the electrical circuit while allowing the

plates to move along the x-axis, which passes through the centers of the plates. The surface

current K is always perpendicular to the

k-direction and ﬂows around the solenoid, in the

+

j direction in the M plate and in the −

j direction in the m plate. The surface current K

parallel to the z-axis within the ﬂattened solenoid. The magnetic ﬂux Φ through the

solenoid is given by the magnitude of B times the cross-sectional area

Φ = BL(X − x) = 4πKL(X − x)/c

(24)

We assume that the separation between the plates is very small 0 < X −x << L, l compared

to the other dimensions so that we can neglect the fringing ﬁelds.

Here we are interested in the case where external mechanical forces on the left and right

current sheets of the ﬂattened solenoid allow these to change location quasi-statically from
x to x′ and from X to X ′ respectively. We assume that there is no ohmic resistance in the

sheets nor any batteries present, so that the currents of the solenoid ﬂow in such a fashion

as to maintain the total magnetic ﬂux Φ through the solenoid as constant in time. The

external forces needed to balance the magnetic forces on the current sheets at x and X are

given by

Just as in the electrostatic case, it is easy to verify the connection between the external

forces and the energy changes for the solenoid.

Eq. (10), ﬁnding

(cid:19)

It is also possible to verify the law in Eq. (14) for the relativistic center of energy. Now

since the cross-sectional area of the solenoid is changing, it follows that the magnetic ﬁeld

must be changing and this means that electric ﬁelds must be induced. Induced electric ﬁelds

together with the solenoid magnetic ﬁeld will lead to electromagnetic ﬁeld linear momentum
and hence to a contribution in Eq. (14) from c2P. In order to ﬁnd the electric ﬁeld induced

when the current sheets are moved apart, we consider a single current sheet seen in a new

Lorentz frame. If we consider a current sheet normal to the x-axis with a current K ﬂowing

in the

j direction, then there is a magnetic ﬁeld B = ±

k(2π/c)K, the factor of 2π rather

than 4π since only a single current sheet is involved. Under Lorentz transformation to a

ﬁeld E = ±

jγ(v/c)(2πK/c). Applying this to both plates of the capacitor, we

ﬁnd that in the region between the moving current sheets, there is a net electric ﬁeld

4. Two Point Charges at Rest

The ﬁnal quasi-static example involves two point charges, one of mass m charge q and

the other of mass M and charge Q, both at rest in some inertial frame. Again the analysis

involves both electromagnetic ﬁeld energy and also electromagnetic ﬁeld momentum as these
charges are displaced quasi-statically from r to r′ and from R to R′ respectively.

In the

limit of quasi-static motion, there is no radiation emission on changing the electrostatic

conﬁguration and so the center-of-energy theorem can be veriﬁed exactly.

Here again, the only interesting aspects of the conservation laws involve the energy and

the center-of-energy. The external forces needed to move the charges quasi-statically simply

balance the electrostatic forces between the charges

while the total energy is the rest-mass energy plus the electrostatic energy

relativistic law (14) for the center of energy is not. The center of the electromagnetic

energy, by symmetry or by direct integration of the interference energy between the point-
d3r r 2Em · EM , is located half-way between the two charges so that

This agrees exactly with the position-weighted power expression on the right-hand side of

Eq. (38). Hence indeed the relativistic law for the center of energy is illustrated in this

case; the Coulomb potential between two point charges ﬁts with the low-velocity limit of

electromagnetic theory so as to give continuous motion for the center of energy under quasi-

static displacements by external forces.

B. Systems Involving Acceleration

In the examples above, we have tried to illustrate how considerations of momentum and

electromagnetic energy enter into the relativistic law for the center of energy when treating

quasi-static changes of stationary systems. Here we wish to note the role of relativistic

energy and momentum for particles. The simplest example seems to be that discussed

above in Section A2 involving a parallel plate capacitor where now the masses m and M

of the plates are no longer treated as negligible and where the external forces providing

a static conﬁguration are removed.

In this case, the parallel plates m and M of the

solenoid accelerated toward each other under electrostatic attraction. We will verify all

of the conservation laws for the quantities in Eqs. (1)-(4), and we will note just where it

is that the distinction between nonrelativistic and relativistic particle mechanics becomes

important.

The parallel plate capacitor example of Section A2 involves motion along only the x-axis.

Newton’s equations of motion for the plates along the x-axis take the form[8]

(42)

where the electrostatic force on each plate is due to the average ﬁeld across the plate or is

regarded as due to the electric ﬁeld due to the other plate.

In the approximation of large

13

parallel plates with small separation, there is no magnetic ﬁeld present even if the plates

are moving with ﬁnite velocity, so that there is no electromagnetic linear momentum for the

system. Therefore the system linear momentum is simply the mechanical momentum of the

particles

The system angular momentum is a constant at L = 0 for all time. Thus all of the con-

required the speciﬁcation of nonrelativistic or relativistic particle mechanics in this electro-

magnetic system. However, the relativistic law for the center of energy is diﬀerent; this

involves the generator of proper Lorentz transformations and it requires a fully relativistic

treatment. Thus the time-rate-of-change of the system energy times the center of energy

follows from Eqs. (46) and (49) as

(UX ) =Umv + UM V = c2P

However, as we see from Eq. (43) this requires that Umv = c2pm and UM V = c2pM . This is

not true for nonrelativistic particle energy and momentum. It is true only for the relativistic

mechanical energy and momentum where

Umech−rel =

and

pmech−rel =

(55)

mc2
[1 − (v/c)2]1/2

mv
[1 − (v/c)2]1/2

Thus provided that we use the exact relativistic expressions for particle energy and momen-

tum as well as the exact results of electromagnetic theory, the relativistic center-of-energy

law (7) is indeed satisﬁed for a parallel-plate capacitor where there are no external forces

present and the plates are free to accelerate. We notice that the contributions from both

the relativistic mechanical energy and the electromagnetic energy are absolutely necessary

for the validity of the center-of-energy law.

15

It might seem that the other examples involving a ﬂattened slip-joint solenoid and two

charged particles can be carried over to the situation allowing accelerations when no external

forces are present. However, these extensions fail because the electromagnetic behavior is

not correctly treated for situations of ﬁnite velocity and acceleration. Although the electro-

magnetic ﬁeld expressions for a capacitor, in the large-plate-small-separation approximation,

do not change at ﬁnite velocity and acceleration, this is not true for the a ﬂattened slip-joint

solenoid or point charges. The expressions used in these quasi-static analyses are valid only

in the low-velocity limit and can be extended to the situation of accelerating particles only

in this low-velocity limit. The complications involved are clearly evident in the case of two

charged particles. The Darwin Lagrangian[10] correctly describes the interaction of point
charges through order v2/c2. Even in this order, the particle equations of motion, can be

exceedingly complex,[11] and beyond this order one requires the full Maxwell’s equations to

describe the electromagnetic ﬁeld. These situations involve radiation emission and do not

seem to lend themselves to simple examples.

IV.

ILLUSTRATING THE CENTER OF ENERGY LAW IN OTHER INERTIAL

FRAMES

Since the energy times the center of energy is the generator of proper Lorentz trans-

formations, it is natural to wish to see the form taken by the examples in various inertial

frames. The example involving the acceleration of the capacitor plates retains its form

under any Lorentz transformation along the x-axis.

Indeed, the electric ﬁeld between the
i4πQ/L2 in any such inertial frame and the expressions for the mechan-

plates remains E =

ical energy and momentum are unchanged so that the entire analysis is identical for any

b

such Lorentz-transformed frame. However, if a Lorentz transformation is made in another

direction, then the situation becomes distinctly more complicated. The parallel plate ca-

pacitor requires forces of constraint for its stability. Provided these forces of constraint do

no work in a Lorentz-transformed frame, they will not disrupt the conservation laws, just

as they did not in our calculations above. However, in any inertial frame where the forces

of constraint do work, there must be a ﬂow of energy, and hence also of momentum, which

invalidate any conservation laws which do not take account of these ﬂows.[12] The parallel

plates in our examples have ﬁnite extent and therefore must have forces of constraint in the

16

y- and z-directions, which forces prevent the charged plates from ﬂying apart. Thus our

conservation analysis will hold in any inertial frame moving with ﬁnite velocity in the x-

direction since the forces in the y- and z-directions do no work. The examples involving the

ﬂattened slip-joint solenoid and two charged particles relatively at rest also require forces

of constraint which must be analyzed carefully.[13]

V. DISCUSSION

Nonrelativistic mechanics is invariant under the group of Galilean transformations. Elec-

trodynamics is invariant under the Poincare group. However, often nonrelativistic particle

mechanics is joined with Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory in describing physical phenomena.

Indeed, in classes where the elementary examples above are assigned as homework, students

invariably use nonrelativistic equations of particle motion unless explicitly required to calcu-

late with the relativistic forms. Using nonrelativistic equations of particle motion, students

have no trouble with the conservation laws for linear momentum, angular momentum, and

energy. Clearly both nonrelativistic particle dynamics and electromagnetism contain these

conservation laws, and the examples involve simply the transfer of these quantities from one

system to the other through forces.

It is only in the invariance of the velocity of the center

of energy that we become aware that Poincare invariance enforces strong restrictions on the

theory. Nonrelativistic particle equations of motion fail to yield the invariant motion of the

center of energy when electromagnetic energy and particle kinetic energy are included.

The three examples of the relativistic conservation laws which we have given here all in-

volve classical electromagnetism which is invariant under the Poincare group. The example

of the accelerating plates of a parallel-plate capacitor illustrates that mixtures of nonrelativis-

tic and relativistic physics still lead to the conservation laws for linear momentum, angular

momentum, and energy while only fully relativistic systems satisfy the law for the center

of energy. Calculation of the center-of-energy motion forces us to notice the distinction

between relativistic physics and the alternatives. Within relativistic physics, it is not at all

clear that particles can interact through any arbitrary potential function V (|r − R|); the 1/r

Coulomb or Kepler potential appears as part of the relativistic theories of electromagnetism

and gravitation.

Indeed it seems fascinating that the generator of the O(4) symmetry asso-

ciated with the Runge-Lenz vector of the nonrelativistic 1/r Kepler problem[14] is precisely

17

the nonrelativistic limit of the generator U
from the Darwin Lagrangian for the v2/c2-interaction of two charged particles.[15]

−→
X for proper Lorentz transformations obtained

The relativistic conservation laws associated with Poincare invariance require the use of

relativistic physics for both the interactions and the mechanical energy and momentum.[16]

However, both the text book and research literature in physics contain many examples where

nonrelativistic and relativistic aspects are mixed together. This arrangement maintains the

conservation laws of linear momentum, energy, and angular momentum, but not the rela-

tivistic law for the center of energy. For the most part this does not lead to signiﬁcant

diﬃculties in one-step calculations when the particle mechanics is taken as nonrelativistic

in the presence of ﬁxed electromagnetic ﬁelds and only the particle motion is of interest.[17]

However, there are multi-step calculations where the charged particles respond with non-

relativistic motion to electromagnetic ﬁelds and in turn the electromagnetic ﬁelds arising

from the nonrelativisticly-moving particles are of interest; these calculations lead to ques-

tionable conclusions. Thus, for example, the Aharonov-Bohm phase shift involves the
v2/c2-interaction of a point charge and a solenoid; yet the response of the solenoid to the

charged particle’s ﬁelds is often treated using nonrelativistic physics.[18] One instance of

the paradoxical and erroneous descriptions which can arise from such a treatment of the

charged particle-solenoid interaction is discussed by Coleman and Van Vleck;[1] other dis-

cussions have also been given.[19] A second example involves the scattering of random

classical radiation by a mechanical scatterer so as to obtain the equilibrium spectrum corre-

sponding to thermal (blackbody) radiation. It is common practice[20] to use nonrelativistic

mechanical behavior for the scattering charges despite the fact that the electromagnetic

ﬁelds arising from the nonrelativisticly-moving particles are of crucial interest in obtain-

ing radiation equilibrium.

In some instances,[21] relativistic particle mechanics has been

combined with nonrelativistic potential functions in an attempt to discuss classical radi-

ation equilibrium.

In all these instances, the relativistic center-of-energy law is violated

because the systems do not satisfy Poincare invariance. Yet relativistic transformations

are clearly crucial in understanding blackbody radiation since the Planck spectrum can be

obtained by Lorentz transformations associated with uniform (proper) acceleration through

Lorentz-invariant zero-point radiation.[22]

In this article we have given several elementary examples of the relativistic center-of-

energy law. There are very few examples of the law presented in the text book literature

18

and the relativistic restrictions associated with the law seem to be unnoticed in some of

the physics research literature. Thus a century after Einstein’s striking work on special

relativity, there are still elementary aspects of Lorentz invariance which go unmentioned in

the text books and unappreciated in the research literature.

[1] S. Coleman and J. H. Van Vleck, ”Origin of ‘Hidden Momentum Forces’ on Magnets,” Phys.

Rev. 171, 1370-1375 (1968).

[2] Perhaps in part because there are so few simple examples involving the center of energy, there

is a variety of terminology in the literature. Here we have chosen to speak of the ”center

of energy,” following the usage of Coleman and Van Vleck in Ref. 1. However, E. F. Taylor

and J. A. Wheeler in Spacetime Physics (Freeman, San Francisco, 1966), p. 143, speak of

the ”center of mass” with the understanding that ”mass” means ”mass-energy” as beﬁts a

relativistic theory. L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz in The Classical Theory of Fields, 4th

ed. (Pergamon, New York, 1985), p. 168, speak of the ”center of inertia.” J. L. Anderson,

”Principles of Relativity Physics” (Academic Press, New York 1967), p. 207-208 writes, ”We

can call Z the center of energy of the system of particles, in analogy to the center of mass

as deﬁned in Newtonian mechanics. According to Eq.(7-5.7), this point moves like a free
particle with a velocity V, given by Eq. (7-5.9) If P µPµ = M 2 >= 0, we can always perform

a mapping so that P µ = (M, 0). The corresponding reference frame is called variously, the

center of mass, or center of momentum, or center of energy frame. We prefer the latter

terminology.

In this frame V = 0.” All of these designations mean the same thing. Here

the ”center of energy” terminology has been used so as to impress upon the reader that this

is a change in point of view from the nonrelativistic ”center of (rest) mass” concept where

there is no role for electromagnetic energy or even particle kinetic energy and only particle

rest masses are involved.

[3] See, for example, D. J. Griﬃths, Introduction to Electrodynamics, 3rd ed. (Prentice Hall,

Upper Saddle River, NJ. 1999). Chapter 8 is devoted to conservation laws in electromagnetic

theory– including conservation of charge, energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum.

There is no mention of the invariant motion of the center of energy. Indeed, it was Griﬃths’

clear organization of the conservation laws which made me acutely aware of the absence of

19

the last conservation law of Poincare invariance.

[4] I an not aware of any simple examples of the center-of-energy theorem in electromagnetism

textbooks. L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz in The Classical Theory of Fields, 2nd ed.

(Pergamon, Oxford, 1962), p. 194, give as a problem the determination of the ”center of

inertia” for a collection of interacting point charges. This problem is repeated on page 168

of the 4th edition listed in Ref. 2 above. J. D. Jackson in Classical Electrodynamics 2nd

ed. (Wiley, New York, 1975), p. 617, has problem 12.16 to derive the uniform motion of the

”center of mass” for an arbitrary, localized distribution of source-free electromagnetic ﬁelds.

The question is repeated as problem 12.19 in the 3rd edition of 1999.

[5] The basic idea appears in the early work of A. Einstein, ”Prinzip von der Erhaltung der Schw-

erpunktsbewegung und die Tr¨agheit der Energie,” Annalen der Physik 20, 626-633 (1906). It

is also given by E. Bessel-Hagen, ” ¨Uber die Erhaltungss¨atze der Elektrodynamick,” Mathe-

matisch Annalen 84, 259-276 (1921). Bessel-Hagen analyzes the conservation laws associated

with the conformal group satisﬁed by Maxwell’s equations.

[8] The forces on each plate can be regarded as due to the average electric ﬁeld across the plate, or

as due to the electric ﬁeld of the other plate, or as due to the pressure of the electromagnetic

ﬁeld. (See, for example, D. J. Griﬃths in Ref. 3, p. 102, Eq. (2.50), or E. M. Purcell, Electricity

Abstract

It is demonstrated how the right hand sides of the Lorentz Transformation equa-
tions may be written, in a Lorentz invariant manner, as 4–vector scalar products.
This implies the existence of invariant length intervals analagous to invariant proper
time intervals. This formalism, making essential use of the 4-vector electromagnetic
potential concept, provides a short derivation of the Lorentz force law of classical
electrodynamics, the conventional deﬁnition of the magnetic ﬁeld, in terms of spa-
tial derivatives of the 4–vector potential and the Faraday-Lenz Law. An important
distinction between the physical meanings of the space-time and energy-momentum
4–vectors is pointed out.

Introduction

Numerous examples exist in the literature of the derivation of electrodynamical equa-
tions from simpler physical hypotheses. In Einstein’s original paper on Special Relativ-
ity [1], the Lorentz force law was derived by performing a Lorentz transformation of the
electromagnetic ﬁelds and the space-time coordinates from the rest frame of an electron
(where only electrostatic forces act) to the laboratory system where the electron is in
motion and so also subjected to magnetic forces. A similar demonstration was given
by Schwartz [2] who also showed how the electrodynamic and magnetodynamic Maxwell
equations can be derived from the Gauss laws of electrostatics and magnetostatics by ex-
ploiting the 4-vector character of the electromagnetic current and the symmetry properties
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor. The same type of derivation of the electrodynamic and
magnetodynamic Maxwell equations has recently been performed by the present author
on the basis of ‘space-time exchange symmetry’ [3]. Frisch and Wilets [4] discussed the
derivation of Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz force law by application of relativistic
transforms to the electrostatic Gauss law. Dyson [5] published a proof, due originally to
Feynman, of the Faraday-Lenz law of induction, based on Newton’s Second Law and the
quantum commutation relations of position and momentum, that excited considerable
interest and a ﬂurry of comments and publications [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] about a decade
ago. Landau and Lifshitz [12] presented a derivation of Amp`ere’s Law from the electro-
dynamic Lagrangian, using the Principle of Least Action. By relativistic transformation
of the Coulomb force from the rest frame of a charge to another inertial system in rela-
tive motion, Lorrain, Corson and Lorrain [13] derived both the Biot-Savart law, for the
magnetic ﬁeld generated by a moving charge, and the Lorentz force law.

In many text books on classical electrodynamics the question of what are the funda-
mental physical hypotheses underlying the subject, as distinct from purely mathematical
developments of these hypotheses, used to derive predictions, is not discussed in any de-
tail. Indeed, it may even be stated that it is futile to address the question at all. For
example, Jackson [14] states:

At present it is popular in undergraduate texts and elsewhere to attempt to derive
magnetic ﬁelds and even Maxwell equations from Coulomb’s law of electrostatics and
the theory of Special Relativity. It should immediately obvious that, without additional
assumptions, this is impossible.’

This is, perhaps, a true statement. However, if the additional assumptions are weak
ones, the derivation may still be a worthwhile exercise. In fact, in the case of Maxwell’s
equations, as shown in References [2, 3], the ‘additional assumptions’ are merely the formal
deﬁnitions of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in terms of the space–time derivatives of the
4–vector potential [15]. In the case of the derivation of the Lorentz force equation given
below, not even the latter assumption is required, as the magnetic ﬁeld deﬁnition appears
naturally in the course of the derivation.

In the chapter on ‘The Electromagnetic Field’ in Misner Thorne and Wheeler’s book

‘Gravitation’ [16] can be found the following statement:

Here and elsewhere in science, as stressed not least by Henri Poincar´e, that view is

1

out of date which used to say, “Deﬁne your terms before you proceed”. All the laws and
theories of physics, including the Lorentz force law, have this deep and subtle chracter,
that they both deﬁne the concepts they use (here ~B and ~E) and make statements about
these concepts. Contrariwise, the absence of some body of theory, law and principle
deprives one of the means properly to deﬁne or even use concepts. Any forward step in
human knowlege is truly creative in this sense: that theory concept, law, and measurement
—forever inseperable—are born into the world in union.

I do not agree that the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are the fundamental concepts
of electromagnetism, or that the Lorentz force law cannot be derived from simpler and
more fundamental concepts, but must be ‘swallowed whole’, as this passage suggests.
As demonstrated in References [2, 3] where the electrodynamic and magnetodynamic
Maxwell equations are derived from those of electrostatics and magnetostatics, a more
economical description of classical electromagentism is provided by the 4–vector potential.
Another example of this is provided by the derivation of the Lorentz force law presented
in the present paper. The discussion of electrodynamics in Reference [16] is couched
entirely in terms of the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor, F µν, and the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds which, like the Lorentz force law and Maxwell’s equations, are ‘parachuted’ into the
exposition without any proof or any discussion of their interrelatedness. The 4–vector
potential is introduced only in the next-but-last exercise at the end of the chapter. After
the derivation of the Lorentz force law in Section 3 below, a comparison will be made
with the treatment of the law in References [2, 14, 16].

The present paper introduces, in the following Section, the idea of an ‘invariant for-
mulation’ of the Lorentz Transformation (LT) [17]. It will be shown that the RHS of the
LT equations of space and time can be written as 4-vector scalar products, so that the
transformed 4-vector components are themselves Lorentz invariant quantities. Consid-
eration of particular length and time interval measurements demonstrates that this is a
physically meaningful concept. It is pointed out that, whereas space and time intervals
are, in general, physically independent physical quantities, this is not the case for the
space and time components of the energy-momentum 4-vector. In Section 3, a derivation
of the Lorentz force law, and the associated magnetic ﬁeld concept, is given, based on the
invariant formulation of the LT. The derivation is very short, the only initial hypothesis
being the usual deﬁnition of the electric ﬁeld in terms of the 4-vector potential, which, in
fact, is also uniquely speciﬁed by requiring the deﬁnition to be a covariant one. In Section
4 the time component of Newton’s Second Law in electrodynamics, obtained by applying
space-time exchange symmetry [3] to the Lorentz force law, is discussed.

Throughout this paper it is assumed that the electromagnetic ﬁeld constitutes, to-
gether with the moving charge, a conservative system; i.e. eﬀects of radiation, due to the
acceleration of the charge, are neglected

Invariant Formulation of the Lorentz Transforma-
tion

The space-time LT equations between two inertial frames S and S’, written in a space-

2

time symmetric manner, are:

The frame S’ moves with velocity, v, relative to S, along the common x-axis of S and S’.
β and γ are the usual relativistic parameters:

where c is the speed of light, and

≡
where t is the time recorded by an observer at rest in S. Clocks in S and S’ are synchronised,
i.e., t = t′ = 0, when the origins of the spatial cordinates of S and S’ coincide.

Eqns(2.1)-(2.4) give the relation between space and time intervals ∆~r = ~r2

Suppose now that a physical object, O, of Newtonian mass, m, is at rest in the frame S’;
then t′ = τ is the proper time of the object. The following 4-vectors are now deﬁned [18]:

X, V and P are the space-time, velocity and energy-momentum 4-vectors of the object
O respectively. It follows from Eqns(2.8)-(2.11) and the deﬁnition of P in (2.14) that it
has the following LT between the frames S and S’:

Inspection of (2.8)-(2.11) and (2.15)-(2.18) shows that the LT equations for ∆X and P
are identical. However, as will be now discussed, there is an important diﬀerence in the
physical interpretation of the two sets of transformation equations.

The magnitude of the invariant interval sx,0 speciﬁes four rectangular hyperbolae on
the Minkowski plot of ∆x versus ∆x0 (Fig 1). The four hyperbolae result from the double

The intervals ∆x and ∆x0 corresponding to any pair of space-time points lie one of
these hyperbolae. If the points have a space-like separation (s2
x,0 > 0) the corresponding
intervals lie on (2.25) or (2.26); if they have a time-like separation (s2
x,0 < 0) they lie on
(2.27) or (2.28). The diﬀerent points on each hyperbola are the intervals of the same pair
of space-time events as recorded by diﬀerent inertial observers. As shown in Fig 1, the
magnitude, sx,0 of the invariant interval is equal to the distance of closest approach of
each hyperbola to the origin in the Minkowski plot.

Now it is interesting to note that any space or time interval ∆x or ∆x0 may be iden-
tiﬁed with an invariant interval in a particular reference frame. Consider the hyperbolae
with ∆x intercepts s+
In the inertial frame in which ∆x0 = 0 (the
intersection of these hyperbolae with the ∆x axis) it follows from (2.25) and (2.26) that:

The measurement in this frame consists of taking the diﬀerence between the spatial coor-
dinates of events at some ﬁxed time. Such a frame may be deﬁned for any pair of space-like
separated events as a consequence of the geometry of the Minkowski plot. Notice that
∆x is not necessarily deﬁned in terms of such a measurement. If, following Einstein [1],
the interval ∆x is associated with the length, ℓ, of a measuring rod at rest in S and lying
parallel to the x-axis, measurements of the ends of the rod can be made at arbitarily
diﬀerent times in S. The same result ℓ = ∆x will be found for the length of the rod,
but the corresponding invariant intervals, s+
x as deﬁned by Eqn(2.25),(2.26) will be
diﬀerent in each case. Such measurements, with ∆x0
= 0 are associated with all points
x and s−
of the hyperbolae with ∆x-axis intercepts s+
x , except their intersections with the
∆x-axis.

x , s−

Similarly, ∆x0 may be identiﬁed with the time-like invariant interval corresponding to
successive observations of a clock at a ﬁxed position (i.e. ∆x = 0) in S. In this case (2.27)
and (2.28) give:

This correponds, in the Minkowski plot, to the inertial frame for which the hyperbolaa
with ∆x0-axis intercepts s+
0 intersect this axis. Such a frame exists for every pair of
time-like separated events. The interval ∆x0 could also be measured by observing the
diﬀerence of the times recorded by a local clock and another, synchronised, one located at
a diﬀerent position in S, after a suitable correction for light propagation time delay. Each
such pair of clocks would yield the same value, ∆x0, for the time diﬀerence between two
events in S, but with diﬀerent values of the invariant intervals given by (2.27) or (2.28).

The invariant quantities s+

c∆τ where ∆τ is the proper
0 are better known as

time interval in the frame S. Less well-known however is that as a consequence of the
x , s−
space-time symmetry manifest on the Minkowski plot, s+
x may be also identiﬁed with
invariant space intervals
∆λ in the frame S. This is the same as the length, along the x-
axis, of any physical object at rest in S. Both ∆τ and ∆λ may be deﬁned by measurents
corresponding to particular space-time projections in the frame S. As discussed above,
∆τ corresponds to a ∆x = 0 projection and ∆λ to a ∆x0 = 0 one. The role of such
projections in the generation of the various apparent distortions of space-time in special
relativity has been discussed in [20]. In every-day language these projections correpond
to observations of a clock at a ﬁxed position, or of the dimension of an object at rest, i.e.
the usual way in which time and space measurements are made.

±

The intervals ∆x and ∆x0 refer, in general, to space and time diﬀerences between dif-
ferent events. The latter may be, but are not necessarily, related to properties of the same
physical object. As discussed above, ∆x may be, for example, identiﬁed with the physical
length, ℓ, of a rod, but the LT equations (2.8)-(2.11) are valid for any pair whatsoever
of space-time events. Thus in Eqn(2.20), ∆x and ∆x0 may be freely and independently

sonding to the same or diﬀerent values of s0,x.

The situation is quite diﬀerent for the quantities p0 and px as a consequence of the
existence of the Lorentz scalar, m, the Newtonian mass, which is a ﬁxed property of any
physical object O. Because of the relation (2.24) it follows that for ﬁxed pT , as required
by the LT equations (2.16) and (2.17), the value of p0 is determined by that of px, and
vice versa. Therefore only one of these quantites is independent for any physical object.

It has been shown above that arbitary space and time intervals ∆x and ∆x0 are equal
to certain Lorentz invariant quantities Sx and S0 by noting that the latter correspond to
measurements of the metric in Eqn(2.20) with ∆x0 = 0 and ∆x = 0 respectively. Because
of this the LT equations (2.8) and (2.11) may be written the following invariant form:

The time-like 4-vector, U, is equal to V /c, where V is the 4–vector velocity of S’ relative
to S, whereas the space-like 4–vector, ¯U , is ‘orthogonal to U in four dimensions’[21]:

U(β)

¯U (β) = 0

·

Since the RHS of (2.33) and (2.34) are 4–vector scalar products, S′
0 are manifestly
Lorentz invariant quantites. These 4–vector components may be deﬁned, in terms of
speciﬁc space-time measurements, by equations similar to (2.29)-(2.32) in the frame S’.
Note that the 4–vectors S and S′ are ‘doubly covariant’ in the sense that S
S′ are
‘doubly invariant’ quantities whose spatial and temporal terms are, individually, Lorentz
invariant:

Every term in this equation remains invariant if the spatial and temporal intervals de-

tive to both S and S’. This follows from the manifest Lorentz invariance of the RHS of
Eqn(2.33) and (2.34) and their inverses:

Again, W ′

(2.43), for the electromagnetic 4–vector potential, A, is found to play a crucial role in the
derivation of the Lorentz force law presented below.

An interesting special case is the energy-momentum 4–vector P . Choosing the x-axis
parallel to ~p and β to correspond to the object’s velocity, so that S’ is the object’s proper

Since the Lorentz transformation is determined by the single parameter, β, then it follows
from (2.44) and (2.45) that, unlike in the case of the space and time intervals in Eqn(2.20),
the spatial and temporal components of the energy momentum 4–vector, in an arbitary
inertial frame, are not, as already discussed above, independent. Thus, although the
LT equations for the space-time and energy-momentum 4–vectors are mathematically
identical, the physical interpretation of the transformed quantities is quite diﬀerent in the
two cases.

3 Derivation of the Lorentz force law and the Mag-

netic Field

In electrostatics, the electric ﬁeld, ~E, is customarily written in terms of the electrostatic
potential, φ, according to the equation ~E =
~
φ. The potential at a distance, r, from a
∇
−
point charge, Q, is given by Coulomb’s law φ(r) = Q/r. This, together with the equation
~F = q ~E, deﬁning the force, ~F , exerted on a charge, q, by the electric ﬁeld, completes the
speciﬁcation of the dynamical basis of classical electromagnetism.

It remains to generalise the above equation, relating the electric ﬁeld to the electro-
static potential, in a manner consistent with special relativity. In relativistic notation [22],
the electric ﬁeld is related to the potential by the equation: Ei = ∂iA0, where φ is iden-
tiﬁed with the time component, A0, of the 4–vector electromagnetic potential (A0; ~A). In
order to respect special relativity the electric ﬁeld must be deﬁned in a covariant manner,
i.e.
in the same way in all inertial frames. The electrostatic law may be generalised in
two ways:

Ei

(3.1)

This equation shows the only possibilities to deﬁne the electric ﬁeld in a way that respects
the symmetry with respect to the exchange of space and time coordinates that is a general
property of all special relativistic laws [3]. Choosing i = 1 in Eqn(3.1) and transforming
all quantities on the RHS into the S’ frame, by use of the inverses of Eqns(2.1) and (2.4),
leads to the following expressions for the 1–component of the electric ﬁeld in S, in terms
of quantites deﬁned in S’:

(3.4)

This is the ‘additional assumption’, mentioned by Jackson in the passage quoted above,
that is necessary, in the present case, to derive the Lorentz force law. However, as written,
it concerns only the physical properties of the electric ﬁeld: the magnetic ﬁeld concept
has not yet been introduced. A further a posteriori justiﬁcation of Eqn(3.4) will be given
after derivation of the Lorentz force law. Here it is simply noted that, if the spatial part
of the 4–vector potential is time-independent, Eqn(3.4) reduces to the usual electrostatic
deﬁnition of the electric ﬁeld.

The force ~F ′ on an electric charge q at rest in the frame S’ is given by the deﬁnition

of the electric ﬁeld, and Eqn(3.4) as:

(3.5)

~W = 0 for any 3-vector ~W , and Eqn(3.12) has been used. Eqn(3.15) is just the
since ~W
Faraday-Lenz induction law, i.e. the magnetodynamic Maxwell equation. This is only
apparent, however, once the ‘magnetic ﬁeld’ concept of Eqn(3.12) has been introduced.
Thus the initial hypothesis, Eqn(3.4), is actually a Maxwell equation. This is the a
posteriori justiﬁcation, mentioned above, for this covariant deﬁnition of the electric ﬁeld.
Actually, since (3.12) above follows from (3.4), using only relativistic covariance (i.e.
Eqn(3.5)) the Faraday-Lenz law, (3.15), is derived with special relativity and the covariant
deﬁnition of the electric ﬁeld, (3.4), as the only initial hypotheses.

It is common in discussions of electromagnetism to introduce the second rank electro-

magnetic ﬁeld tensor, F µν according to the deﬁnition:

From the point of view adopted in the present paper both the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor
and the electric and magnetic ﬁelds themselves are auxiliary quantities introduced only
for mathematical convenience, in order to write the equations of electromagnetism in a
compact way. Since all these quantities are completly deﬁned by the 4–vector potential,
it is the latter quantity that encodes all the relevant physical information on any electro-
dynamic problem [26]. This position is contrary to that commonly taken in the literature
and text books where it is often claimed that only the electric and magnetic ﬁelds have
physical signiﬁcance, while the 4–vector potential is only a convenient mathematical tool.
For example R¨ohrlich [27] makes the statement:

These functions (φ and ~A) known as potentials have no physical meaning and are

introduced solely for the purpose of mathematical simpliﬁcation of the equations.

10

In fact, as shown above (compare Eqns(3.11) and (3.13)) it is the introduction of the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds that enable the Lorentz force equation to be written in a simple
manner! In other cases (e.g. Maxwell’s equations) simpler expessions may be written in
terms of the 4–vector potential. The quantum theory, quantum electrodynamics, that
underlies classical electromagnetism, requires the introduction the 4–vector photon ﬁeld,
µ, in order to specify the minimal interaction that provides the dynamical basis of the
A
theory. Similarly, the introduction of Aµ is necessary for the Lagrangian formulation of
classical electromagnetism. It makes no sense, therefore, to argue that a physical concept
of such fundamental importance has ‘no physical meaning’.

The initial postulate used here to derive the Lorentz force law is Eqn(3.4), which
contains, explicitly, the electrostatic force law and, implicitly, the Faraday-Lenz induction
law. The actual form of the electrostatic force law (Coulomb’s inverse square law) is not
invoked, suggesting that the Lorentz force law may be of greater generality. On the
assumption of Eqn(3.4) (which has been demonstrated to be the only possible covariant
deﬁnition of the electric ﬁeld), the existence of the ‘magnetic ﬁeld’, the ‘electromagnetic
ﬁeld tensor’, and ﬁnally the Lorentz force law itself have all been derived, without further
assumptions, by use of the invariant formulation of the Lorentz transformation.

It is instructive to compare the derivation of the Lorentz force law given in the present
paper with that of Reference [13] based on the relativistic transformation properties of the
Coulomb force 3–vector. Coulomb’s law is not used in the present paper. On the other
hand, Reference [13] makes no use of the 4–vector potential concept, which is essential for
the derivation presented here. This demonstrates an interesting redundancy among the
fundamental physical concepts of classical electromagnetism.

In Reference [2], Eqns(3.4), (3.12) and (3.16) were all introduced as a priori initial
postulates without further justiﬁcation. In fact, Schwartz gave the following explanation
for his introduction of Eqn(3.16) [28]:

So far everything we have done has been entirely deductive, making use only of
Coulomb’s law, conservation of charge under Lorentz transformation and Lorentz in-
variance for our physical laws. We have now come to the end of this deductive path. At
In general
this point when the laws were being written, God had to make a decision.
there are 16 components of a second-rank tensor in four dimensions. However, in anal-
ogy to three dimensions we can make a major simpliﬁcation by choosing the completely
antisymmetric tensor to represent our ﬁeld quantities. Then we would have only 6 inde-
pendent components instead of the possible 16. Under Lorentz transformation the tensor
would remain antisymmetric and we would never have need for more than six independent
components. Appreciating this, and having a deep aversion to useless complication, God
naturally chose the antsymmetric tensor as His medium of expression.

Actually it is possible that God may have previously invented the 4–vector potential
and special relativity, which lead, as shown above, to Eqn(3.4) as the only possible co-
variant deﬁnition of the electric ﬁeld. As also shown in the present paper, the existence of
the remaining elements of the antisymmetric ﬁeld tensor, containing the magnetic ﬁeld,
then follow from special relativity alone. Schwartz derived the Lorentz force law, as in
Einstein’s original Special Relativity paper [1], by Lorentz transformation of the electric
ﬁeld, from the rest frame of the test charge, to one in which it is in motion. This requires

11

that the magnetic ﬁeld concept has previously been introduced as well as knowledge of
the Lorentz transformation laws of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.

In the chapter devoted to special relativity in Jackson’s book [29] the Lorentz force
law is simply stated, without any derivation, as are also the deﬁning equations of the
electric and magnetic ﬁelds and the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor just mentioned. No
emphasis is therefore placed on the fundamental importance of the 4–vector potential in
the relativistic description of electromagnetism.

In order to treat, in a similar manner, the electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds, the
discussion in Misner Thorne and Wheeler [16] is largely centered on the properties of the
tensor F µν. Again the Lorentz force equation is introduced, in the spirit of the passage
quoted above, without any derivation or discussion of its meaning. The deﬁning equations
of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds and F µν, in terms of Aµ, appear only in the eighteenth
exercise of the relevant chapter. The main contents of the chapter on the electromagnetic
ﬁeld are an extended discussion of purely mathematical tensor manipulations that obscure
the essential simplicity of electromagnetism when formulated in terms of the 4–vector
potential.

In contrast to References [2, 29, 16], in the derivation of the Lorentz force law, the
magnetic ﬁeld concept and the Faraday Lenz law presented here, the only initial assump-
tion, apart from the validity of special relativity, is the chosen deﬁnition, Eqn(3.4), of the
electric ﬁeld in terms of the 4–vector potential Aµ, which is the only covariant one. Thus,
a more fundamental description of electromagnetism than that provided by the electric
and magnetic ﬁeld concepts is indeed possible, contrary to the opinion expressed in the
passage from Misner Thorne and Wheeler quoted above.

4 The time component of Newton’s Second Law in

Electrodynamics

Space-time exchange symmetry [3] states that physical laws in ﬂat space are invariant
with respect to the exchange of the space and time components of 4-vectors. For example,
the LT of time, Eqn(2.4), is obtained from that for space, Eqn(2.1), by applying the space-
x′. In the present case, application of
x, x′
time exchange (STE) operations: x0
the STE operation to the spatial component of the Lorentz force equation in the second
line of Eqn(3.11) leads to the relation:

Integration of Eqn(4.5) gives the equation of energy conservation for a particle moving
from an initial position, ~xI , to a ﬁnal position, ~xF , under the inﬂuence of electromagnetic
forces:

~β

Thus work is done on the moving charge only by the electric ﬁeld. This is also evident from
~B is perpendicular to the
the Lorentz force equation, (3.14), since the magnetic force
velocity vector, so that no work is performed by the magnetic ﬁeld. A corollary is that
the relativistic energy (and hence the magnitude of the velocity) of a charged particle
moving in a constant magnetic ﬁeld is a constant of the motion. Of course, Eqn(4.5)
may also be derived directly from the Lorentz force law, so that the time component of
the relativistic generalisation of Newton’s Second Law, Eqn(4.1), contains no physical
information not already contained in the spatial components. This is related to the fact
that, as demonstrated in Eqns(2.44) and (2.45), the spatial and temporal components of
the energy-momentum 4–vector are not independent physical quantities.

[15] Actually, a careful examination of the derivation of Amp`ere’s from the Gauss law

is a necessary initial assumption, the deﬁnition of the magnetic ﬁeld in terms of
the spatial derivatives of the 4–vector potential occurs naturally in the course of the
derivation (see Eqns(5.16) and (5.17) of Reference[3]) so it is not necessary to assume,
at the outset, the expression for the spatial components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld

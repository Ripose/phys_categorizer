Comment on “Total Negative Refraction in

Crystals for Ballistic Electrons and Light”

The eﬀect of negative refraction considered in Ref.[1]
resembles the analogous eﬀect in left-handed materials
(LHM) although the physics is diﬀerent.
In LHM the
negative refraction is caused by a negative group velocity,
whereas in the case considered in Ref.[1] one deals with
the special properties of wave propagation in uniaxial
anisotropic media (UAM).

The dispersion relation (DR) for an electromagnetic
plane wave in UAM has the form[2]: ω2/c2 = k2
k/ε⊥ +
k2
⊥/εk, where kk and k⊥ are the components of the wave
vector k parallel and perpendicular to the uniaxis, and
εk and ε⊥ are the corresponding dielectric tensor compo-
nents in a principal coordinate system. It follows from
the DR that vph · vg > 0, whereas in LHM vph · vg < 0,
vph and vg being the phase and group velocities, respec-
tively.
It also follows from the DR that the directions
of the phase and group velocities are connected by the
relation tan ϕg = (ε⊥/εk) tan ϕ, where ϕ and ϕg are the
angles between the anisotropy direction n and the vectors
vph (or k) and vg, respectively. The relation between the
directions of vg and vph can be determined graphically.
As an example we will consider the case of ε⊥/εk > 1.
The end of the vector k lies on an ellipse in the (k⊥, kk)
plane (Fig.1). Let us introduce another ellipse, which is
obtained from the ﬁrst one by stretching it along the k⊥
axis ε⊥/εk times. The vector kg, whose end lies on the
second (bigger) ellipse and has the same projection on
the kk axis as the vector k, is parallel to vg. In such a
way one can obtain the direction of the group velocity
using the direction of the vector k and vice versa. For
simplicity we consider here and below 2D geometry.

B1C1) angles of incidence. The end of the wave vector of
the refracted ray lies on a similar but diﬀerently oriented
ellipse and has the same projection on the interface plane
as the wave vector of the incident ray. In this way one
can determine the wave vector of the refracted ray and,
using the graphical method, the refracted ray direction.
Dividing the right ellipses to regions corresponding to
negative (big ellipse sector A2B2 and small ellipse sector

2) angles of
refraction, it is easy to see that rays with negative angles
of incidence lying in the sector D1B1, transform to rays
with positive angles of refraction (sector B2D2).

A general picture of refraction of arbitrary rays is pre-
sented in Fig.3. The incident ray b and the refracted ray
b′ lie on the same side of the normal to the interface that
seems as negative refraction, but physically this eﬀect has
nothing in common with negative refraction in LHM.

Using this method it is easy to consider the refraction
of rays on the interface between two identical but arbi-
trarily oriented UAM (Fig.2). Keeping in mind that the
direction of the ray coincides with the group velocity di-

rection, one can determine the sectors A′

of the small ellipse, which correspond to rays with nega-
tive (sector A1B1 of the big ellipse) and positive (sector

Note, that a periodic structure composed of alternate
layers with diﬀerent permittivity ε1 and ε2 behaves as
a UAM with respect to electromagnetic waves whose
wavelength is much larger than the structure period.

Abstract: Two results about the planewave response of an isotropic, dielectric–magnetic, homo-
geneous, planar slab are deduced when the real parts of both the permittivity and the permeability
are altered from positive to negative. First, the reﬂection and the transmission coeﬃcients suﬀer
phase reversals without change in their respective magnitudes. Second, the Goos–H¨anchen shifts
experienced by beams on total reﬂection reverse their directions.

Keywords: Goos–H¨anchen shifts; Negative permeability, Negative permittivity, Reﬂection;
Transmission

Introduction

The recent publication of an experimental realization of certain artiﬁcial materials — that are
eﬀectively isotropic, homogeneous, and possess negative real permittivity and permeability in
some frequency range (Shelby, Smith, & Schultz, 2001) — has created a big splash in the
electromagnetics research community. Although the ﬁrst samples of these materials are quite
primitive (Lakhtakia, 2001), there is enough experimental as well as theoretical evidence (Dewar,
2001; McCall, Lakhtakia, & Weiglhofer, 2001) along with the promise of applications (Pendry,
2001), that concerted theoretical research in advance of its experimental counterpart is justiﬁed.

This communication focuses on two aspects of the planewave responses of planar slabs whose
permittivity and permeability have negative real parts at the frequency of interest. The ﬁrst
aspect comprises the magnitudes and phases of the reﬂection and the transmission coeﬃcients;
and the second encompasses the longitudinal shifts experienced by beams on total reﬂection.
An exp(

iωt) time–dependence is implicit, with ω as the angular frequency.

for the remittances.

The symmetry inherent in the relationship (9)

(12) is of signiﬁcance for experiments on
planar, isotropic dielectric–magnetic slabs. When the signs of the real parts of both the permit-
tivity and the permeability of a medium are altered, the planewave reﬂection and transmission
coeﬃcients remain unchanged in magnitude but suﬀer a phase reversal. The alteration cannot
be detected if only the planewave remittances are measured.

3.2 Goos–H¨anchen Shifts

A major consequence of the relationship (9)
(12) can be appreciated when the incident plane
wave is replaced by a beam. By deﬁnition, a plane wave has inﬁnite transverse extent; but a
beam is of ﬁnite transverse extent. Newton had conjectured that if a beam were to impinge on
a planar interface with an electromagnetically rarer medium and total reﬂection were to occur,

⇒

the reﬂected beam would emerge with a longitudinal displacement (along the +x axis). Such
displacements are often called the Goos–H¨anchen shifts after the two scientists who reported
the ﬁrst measurements in 1947 (Goos & H¨anchen, 1947). Subsequently, these shifts have been
estimated as well as measured for planar interfaces between many diﬀerent pairs of materials
(Lakhtakia, 2002; Lotsch, 1970a,b, 1971a,b), and several applications have emerged as well
(Jackson, 1999; Chauvat et al., 2000; de Fornel, 2000).

Analytical treatment of the Goos–H¨anchen shifts essentially requires the solution of the same
problem as dealt with in Section 2 (Haibel, Nimtz, & Stahlhofen, 2001). The vacuous half–
spaces are, however, ﬁlled with a medium possessing ǫb and µb as its relative permittivity and
relative permeability, both positive and real–valued. Equations (1)–(7) still apply, but with (i)
k0 replaced by k0√ǫbµb, and (ii) η0 by η0

µb/ǫb. The relationship (9)

(12) still holds.

This quantity is meaningful, in the present context, only when θinc exceeds the critical angle;
i.e., when total reﬂection occurs. A depth of penetration equal to (d/2) cot θinc is also sometimes
calculated.

Two Goos–H¨anchen shifts are possible in the present scenario: ds and dp for s– and p–polarized
beams, respectively. Their characteristics are well–known (Jackson, 1999; de Fornel, 2000) and
do not bear repetition here. It suﬃces to note here that

this relationship being an immediate consequence of the relationship (9)
(14).

⇒

(12) and the deﬁnition

The result (15) can be understood with the help of Figure 1 as follows: When total reﬂec-
tion occurs and the electromagnetically rarer medium is of the conventional type (i.e., ǫ′
a > 0
and µ′
a > 0), the reﬂected beam appears as if the incident beam has skipped forward. On the
contrary, according to (15), the reﬂected beam must appear to skip backward, if the electromag-
netically rarer medium is of the kind reported by Shelby, Smith, & Schultz (2001) (i.e., ǫ′
a < 0
and µ′
a < 0). No violation of causality would occur in the latter instance, because some time
must elapse during the traversal of the distance that is apparently skipped. This result is also
consistent with the propagation velocity being oppositely directed to the energy velocity when
a < 0 and µ′
ǫ′

a < 0 (McCall, Lakhtakia, & Weiglhofer, 2001).

4 Conclusions

Examining the alteration in the planewave response of an isotropic, dielectric–magnetic, ho-
mogeneous, planar slab when the real parts of both the permittivity and the permeability are
changed from positive to negative, we arrived at the following deductions:

(i) The planewave reﬂection and transmission coeﬃcients suﬀer phase reversals.

(ii) The planewave remittances remain unaﬀected.

(iii) When conditions for total reﬂection prevail, the longitudinal shift experienced by a beams

reverses its direction.

Appendix

Let a matrix [P ] of size m

m be diagonalizable. Then it can be decomposed as

[P ] = [U ] [G] [U ]

,

where the matrix [G] = diag(g1, g2,
gm) contains the consecutive eigenvalues of [P ], while the
successive columns of [U ] are the corresponding eigenvectors of [P ]. It follows that (Hochstadt,

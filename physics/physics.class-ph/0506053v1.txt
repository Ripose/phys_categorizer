Abstract

In this paper I ﬁrst address the question of whether the seat of the power radiated by an

antenna made of conducting members is distributed over the “arms” of the antenna according

to

J

E, where J is the speciﬁed current density and E is the electric ﬁeld produced by that

source. Poynting’s theorem permits only a global identiﬁcation of the total input power, usually

from a localized generator, with the total power radiated to inﬁnity, not a local correspondence

E d3x with some speciﬁc radiated power, r2S

ˆr dΩ.

I then describe a model antenna

consisting of two perfectly conducting hemispheres of radius a separated by a small equatorial

of

−

·

gap across which occurs the driving oscillatory electric ﬁeld. The ﬁelds and surface current are

determined by solution of the boundary value problem. In contrast to the ﬁrst approach (not a

boundary value problem), the tangential electric ﬁeld vanishes on the metallic surface. There is no

radial Poynting vector at the surface. Numerical examples are shown to illustrate how the energy

ﬂows from the input region of the gap and is guided near the antenna by its “arms” until it is

launched at larger r/a into the radiation pattern determined by the value of ka.

I. INTRODUCTION

This paper is a didactic discussion of how the electromagnetic energy radiated by an an-

tenna emerges from a localized source, is guided by the antenna’s conductors, and ultimately

shakes free to form the radiation described by the asymptotic Poynting vector. How this

happens and what is the true seat of the power radiated is understood by many, but not by

all. I hope that an analysis of the rights and wrongs and the treatment of speciﬁc examples

prove useful.

The question of how electromagnetic energy is transported along a system of conductors

dates back to J. H. Poynting’s 1884 paper, On the transfer of energy in the electromagnetic

ﬁeld, in which he enunciates his theorem and discusses various examples.1 Poynting does not

consider radiating systems, but he was very clear on the transport of the electromagnetic

energy associated with current-carrying wires and quasi-static circuits such as a discharging

capacitor.

In modern notation Poynting’s theorem takes the form,

·

·

the electromagnetic energy density within a chosen volume V bounded by the surface S.

The physical interpretation of the theorem is that the left-hand integral represents the rate

at which the given sources (J) supply energy to the electromagnetic ﬁelds. The volume

integral on the right is the rate of increase of electromagnetic energy within V, while the

surface integral is the rate at which energy escapes from V through the surface S. The

theorem is basically a statement of conservation of energy.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, radiated systems were investigated chieﬂy by

speciﬁcation of simple oscillating current and charge distributions. The asymptotic ﬁelds

were found and the Poynting vector evaluated to give the radiation pattern. Performing the

surface integral on the right in (1) gave the total radiated power P in terms of the parameters

of the source, e.g., its dipole moment. For an antenna with a given input current I, the result

was often expressed in terms of a radiation resistance Rrad through the relation, P = I 2Rrad.

In 1922, Brillouin2 pointed out an alternative method for calculating Rrad. For steady-

2

state sinusoidal oscillation of the source, the volume integral on the right in (1) vanishes for

a time average; the input power is equal to the power radiated. The radiation resistance can

be computed equally well by evaluating the integral over the sources on the left-hand side

of (1). This approach was taken up by many3,4 because of its appeal: the current of each

element along the arms of an antenna was apparently the real source of the radiated energy.

At that time (and to some extent today) many believed that energy was transported

within the conductors carrying current. Poynting’s statements to the contrary had been

forgotten. The focus on speciﬁcation of distributed current sources is widespread in many

applications. For antennas the approach works, more or less. Often antennas have thin

straight conducting elements. If such elements have inﬁnitesimal cross sections, it can be

shown that an oscillating current is distributed sinusoidally along its length. The assumption

of sinusoidal behavior proved to yield reasonably accurate results for angular distributions

of radiation from antenna arrays. Specifying a plausible current source J became standard

practice. In such discussions no attention is paid to the fact that a radiating antenna is an

electromagnetic boundary value problem in which the current distributed on the arms of the

antenna emerges as part of the solution, not as input. Rather, an ethereal current distri-

bution is postulated and the resulting ﬁelds calculated. This approach may be appropriate

for electrons orbiting in a synchrotron or undergoing a quantum-mechanical transition in an

atom, but not for a careful treatment of a realistic antenna with conducting surfaces.

The antenna as a boundary value problem has, of course, an honorable history beginning

in 1897 with Pocklington5 who discussed the lowest mode of a perfectly conducting ring of

wire (damped by radiation loss). Lord Rayleigh extended the work to the higher modes in

1912, with special attention to the damping.6 The history is summarized by R. W. P. King7

in his Introduction. Noteworthy are the works of L. V. King8 and Hall´en9 in the 1930s on a

long cylindrical antenna with a solution by means of an integral equation. In the early 1940s,

Schelkunoﬀ, in a paper10 and a book11, discussed perfectly conducting biconical antennas

in which the cones act as wave guides. A spherical antenna with a planar circular gap can

be viewed as a limiting case.11 At the same time, Stratton and Chu analyzed three models

of antennas: the circular cylinder12,the sphere13, and the prolate spheroid.14 Subsequently,

R. W. P. King and colleagues made extensive use of Hall´en’s approach for linear antennas.

Their results and literature are thoroughly documented in King’s book.7 A sampling of

the accumulating literature on cylindrical, biconical, and spherical antennas in the applied

3

journals is contained in references.15,16,17,18

In none of these works is attention paid to the ﬁelds and energy ﬂow in the immediate

neighborhood of the antenna. F. M. Landstorfer and co-workers are one group that has

explored numerically ﬁeld lines and power ﬂow in the neighborhood of guiding conducting

surfaces: a half-dipole antenna on a conducting plane,19 wave-guide discontinuities and

dipole antennas,20 two-dimensional diﬀraction,21 and examples of gain-optimized antennas.22

Surprising eddies of power ﬂow can be seen in some examples.

In Section II, I discuss a thin center-fed linear antenna by speciﬁcation of a sinusoidal

axial current density of vanishing cross section, with no attempt to solve a boundary

value problem. The two diﬀerent approaches to determining the total power radiated are

described. The question of whether the element of “input” power

J

E at a particular

−

·

point along the antenna can associated with a particular segment of the radiated power

is answered.
I also make some comments here on reasons for the relative success of this
na¨ive approach. In Section III, I describe a particular antenna boundary value problem, a

perfectly conducting sphere with a small gap at the equator, across which is an azimuthally

uniform electric ﬁeld. As already stated, this problem has been addressed by Stratton

and Chu13 and by Schelkunoﬀ23. These authors were interested in the impedance of the

antenna, including radiation, but did not discuss the Poynting vector in the neighborhood

of the antenna or its evolution to the far ﬁelds. Section III sets up the formalism; Section

IV gives examples of the energy ﬂow, the current on the surface, and the modiﬁcation of the

energy ﬂow for non-vanishing surface resistivity. Section V contains concluding remarks.

An appendix gives the expansion in associated Legendre functions of the electric ﬁeld at

the gap, a necessary ingredient for the multipole expansion of Section II.

II. EXAMPLE OF LINEAR ANTENNA

As discussed in the Introduction, a common approach to the emission of radiation by

an antenna is to postulate (with greater or lesser justiﬁcation) the sources as given current

and charge distributions. The potentials and the ﬁelds are then evaluated in the usual way

as integrals over the source with the appropriate Green function. We discuss brieﬂy the

very thin center-fed linear antenna in order to illustrate the confusion that can occur in

evaluating the radiated power in diﬀerent ways via Poynting’s theorem and in arguing the

4

source of the power.

The time dependence is assumed to be exp(

iωt) with k = ω/c. Complex notation is

used, with physical quantities as the real parts of complex expressions. The antenna is

of length 2a, located on the z -axis on the interval

a < z < a. The current and charge

densities on that interval are assumed sinusoidal and are

1. Are the two expressions actually equal? The answer is yes. Each can be transformed into

6

the same uninformative sum of constants, logarithms, and sine and cosine integrals24 that

undulates as a function of ka.26,27

2. Does the variable z in P1 correspond in any way to ζ = a cos θ in P2 and so connect

the increment of power at position z on the antenna to the increment of radiated power at

angle θ ? The answer is no for several reasons. First of all, the integrand in P1 is a spatial

scalar, without direction, whereas the integrand in P2, although a scalar, is the dot product

of the Poynting vector with a unit radial vector whose direction changes with angle.

Secondly, a comparison of integrands shows smaller and larger diﬀerences between the

two “angular” distributions depending on the value of ka. As a matter of fact, for ka =

(2n + 1)π/2, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , the integrand of (10) as a function of z/a is equal to that

of (11) for cos θ = z/a, but for other values of ka the integrands can be vastly diﬀerent, as

shown for example in Figure 1 for ka = 2π.

FIG. 1: Normalized integrands for the two forms P1 and P2 for the total radiated power from a

linear antenna with ka = 2π. The solid curve is the angular distribution of radiation in cos θ from

the Poynting vector expression P2. The dotted curve is the integrand J

E of P1 versus z/a.

·

3. Can the expression for P1 justify the claim that the power radiated by an antenna has

7

its origins at various points along the length of the antenna? The short answer is no.

First of all, the ﬁelds at any point in space receive coherent contributions from all elements

of the current along the whole antenna. King7 (p.562-5) discusses a center-fed antenna with

ka = 3π/2, imagining it as the limit of a line of closely spaced individual generators that

produce the sinusoidal current distribution. He shows that in a certain sense one can identify

each of the three separate “ears” of the angular distribution at inﬁnity with a corresponding

half-wavelength segment of the current distribution. But he is at great pains to make clear

it does not mean that the ﬁelds in each separate angular region are “maintained entirely

and exclusively by the current in [the corresponding] third of the antenna. . . . The ﬁeld at

any point in space is maintained by all currents in the entire antenna.” (op. cit., p.565).

Secondly, as stressed in the Introduction, a source distribution (J, ρ) in the Maxwell

equations does not deﬁne appropriately an antenna boundary-value problem. Antennas are

almost universally constructed of conductors, usually very good conductors. An excellent

approximation for the boundary-value problem is to assume perfect conductivity. Then

there can be a surface current density, but no tangential electric ﬁeld at the surface. There

is therefore no J

E to integrate over the surface to ﬁnd the power. You might say, well, in

·

the real world conductivities are not inﬁnite. Suppose we assume excellent, but not perfect,

conductivity.

In that situation things go the opposite way: There is now a tangential

electric ﬁeld at the surface, but the Poynting vector points inward! Energy ﬂows inward

into, not out from, the conductor; the resistance of the metal converts the electromagnetic

energy into heat; the antenna robs power from the source1,28.

As already said in the Introduction, most antenna experts seem to accept the idea that

the antenna structure does not itself radiate (in the sense that segments of the conductor

are the local sources of power), but rather guides the energy from the input source and

launches it into its ﬁnal radiation pattern. Why then is the approach of speciﬁcation from

the beginning of the current on an antenna so widely accepted and employed? One reason

is that the most common antenna is linear, or an array of linear elements. For a thin linear

antenna the zeroth order current is sinusoidal in amplitude and constant in phase with

position. The solution9 of the boundary value problem yields corrections to the current as

a series in powers of Ω−1, where Ω = 2ln(2h/r), with 2h the length of the antenna and r its

radius. Values of Ω

10

3 is a plausible range: a 100 MHz λ/2 antenna with 2h = 1.5 m

≈

±

8

and a diameter of 0.5 (1.0) cm has Ω = 13(10).

Calculations including ﬁrst order corrections show that for short antennas (kh

2) the

≤

real part of the current either dominates the imaginary part over almost the whole length

of the antenna, or the relative phase changes little over the length. In either circumstance

the radiation pattern of an antenna or antenna array will diﬀer little from that computed
with the na¨ive zeroth order current. Even for larger kh, for which the zeroth order current

changes sign along the length, the imaginary part of the current is generally small compared

to the real part (except in the narrow regions where the real part vanishes). Examples of

the current components on center-fed linear antennas of diﬀerent kh are given by Hall´en29

and King.30

If reliable values of input impedance are desired, second order corrections to the current
at the input point may be required.31 But for radiation patterns of linear antennas the na¨ive

assumption of a real sinusoidal current is adequate in most circumstances.

We now turn to a solvable model of an antenna to show in detail how the energy ﬂows

in its neighborhood and beyond.

III. CENTER-FED SPHERICAL ANTENNA

To illustrate the near ﬁelds and power ﬂow in the immediate neighborhood of an antenna,

we consider a spherical antenna of radius a with excitation provided by an electric ﬁeld

across a narrow equatorial gap between the perfectly conducting near-hemispheres. As

noted earlier, this problem has been treated in some respects by Stratton and Chu13 and

Schelkunoﬀ.23 We follow the notation of Section 9.7 ﬀ in my text.25 The power source does

not concern us except that it manifests itself as an electric ﬁeld across the gap (and the

accompanying surface current on the surface of the sphere). The source can be imagined in

Schelkunoﬀ’s language of conical antennas. Our antenna can be thought of as a limiting

case of a biconical antenna with spherical segments as caps and an opening angle of almost

90 degrees. The sides of the cones meet at the origin inside the sphere. It is there that an

inﬁnitesimal generator resides. It causes an electric ﬁeld between the upper and lower cones

to emerge in an azimuthally symmetric way as Eθ across the gap.

A. Fields and Surface Current

9

Outside the sphere the electric and magnetic ﬁelds can be described by multipole ﬁelds.32

The magnetic multipole ﬁelds have a non-vanishing radial component of the magnetic ﬁeld,

while the electric multipole ﬁelds have a non-vanishing radial component of the electric

ﬁeld. Because the normal component of magnetic ﬁeld vanishes at the surface of a perfect

conductor, while the normal component of the electric ﬁeld does not, we conclude that the

spherical antenna has only electric multipole ﬁelds. Furthermore, because of the assumed

azimuthal symmetry, only (ℓ, m) multipoles with m = 0 occur. The electric and magnetic

ﬁelds for r

plus (28) leads directly to (24), valid at any r

a. Obviously this must hold because of

≥

conservation of energy ﬂow.

The other limiting form (29) shows that the asymptotic angular distribution of radiation
depends on the real part of (i)ℓ′−ℓa∗(ℓ′)a(ℓ) , whereas the radial power ﬂow at nearer dis-

tances can be expected to be diﬀerent because of the more complicated structure of the full

expression (26). And at close distances there is power ﬂow in the transverse (θ) direction as

well. However, the asymptotic form of T (30) shows that that component of the Poynting

vector falls oﬀ faster than r−2. We explore these aspects immediately.

B. Examples of energy ﬂow near the antenna

Figure 2 shows the Poynting vector pattern close to the antenna for ka = 1.0. Here, and

everywhere else unless stated otherwise, the total angular gap is 2ǫ = π/50. One sees that

the power squirts out of the gap in a radial direction, with some transverse ﬂow parallel to

the surface, guided by the antenna surface. Figure 3 is an alternative display, with r/a = 10

as well as r/a = 1.1. The appreciable transverse ﬂow and sharply peaked radial ﬂow near

the antenna goes over into almost purely radial ﬂow of the asymptotic angular distribution.

FIG. 2: Distribution of Poynting vector for ka = 1.0 and r/a = 1.1. Bases of arrows are observation

points, lengths of arrows are relative magnitudes. Close to antenna, power squirts out from gap

dPt/d( cos θ) for ka = 1.0 and r/a = 1.1, 10. Close to antenna, the power is peaked strongly in the

equatorial plane, with some transverse ﬂow. At r/a = 10, the angular distribution is essentially

the featureless asymptotic form, with negligible transverse ﬂow.

Figure 4 and r/a = 1.1, 2, 10 in Figure 5. Note that the behavior of the power ﬂow close

to the antenna is essentially independent of the value of ka, a consequence of the source

being a small equatorial gap. The ﬂow rearranges itself at moderate and large distances,

however, into very diﬀerent asymptotic forms for the diﬀerent values of ka. The antenna

surface guides the ﬂow only fairly nearby.

C. Examples of Surface Current

The surface current density on the sphere is given by (18). Integration over the surface in

azimuth for ﬁxed cos θ yields the distribution Itheta = 2πa sin θ Kθ, the total current ﬂow

across the “latitude” circle at ﬁxed θ, as the analog of the current I(z) for a linear antenna.

[Actually, Isphere(z) = sin θ Iθ is a more accurate analog.] The real and imaginary parts of

Iθ in units of V /Z0 are shown in Figure 6 for the example of ka = 1.0. The real part of the

z -component of the current is not far from proportional to the current on a linear antenna

with ka = 1, namely I0 sin(1

cos θ

). Note, however, the comparable imaginary part, in

contrast to the thin linear antenna.

|

The corresponding current for ka = 3π/2 is shown in Figure 7. Here the real part of

the current displays some resemblance to the three half cycles of a sinusoidal current on a

center-fed linear antenna of the same ka despite the diﬀerences in shape.

power ﬂow dPr/d( cos θ), dPt/d( cos θ) for ka = 3π/2 and r/a = 1.1, 2, 10. Close to antenna,

the radial power is peaked strongly in the equatorial plane, with considerable transverse ﬂow. At

r/a = 2, the equatorial peak has vanished, the transverse ﬂow has diminished, and the radial ﬂow

begins to resemble the r/a = 10 angular distribution, which is essentially the asymptotic form,

with negligible transverse ﬂow.

D. Modiﬁcations because of ﬁnite conductivity

The treatment so far has been based on vanishing resistivity on the surface of the antenna.

In such circumstances the only tangential electric ﬁeld at r = a is in the equatorial gap.

With small but non-vanishing resistivity, a small tangential electric ﬁeld exists over the

whole antenna. A perturbation approach can be used to ﬁnd the ﬁelds and the inﬂowing

Poynting vector at the surface.34 In addition to the zeroth order electric ﬁeld (13), there is

a ﬁrst order tangential electric ﬁeld at the surface, given by

quasistatic limit, the dissipative losses are frequency independent (except for that in the

surface resistance), while the power radiated is proportional to (ka)2.

For the opposite limit, ka >> ℓ, the spherical Hankel function factor can again be large

compared to unity, causing successive terms in the numerator to fall oﬀ more slowly than

those in the denominator. But since the initial terms in numerator and denominator are com-

parable, the cumulative eﬀect is not major and the ratio of sums is of order unity. Here are

some examples: (ka; ratio) = (0.1; 119.6), (0.5; 5.62), (1.0; 2.21), (10; 2.62), (20; 2.66).

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS

The conventional way of specifying the plausible sources ρ, J of charge and current on

antennas can yield reasonable radiation patterns, but fails to address the actual boundary

value problems. By discussing ﬁrst a conventional example of a center-fed linear antenna,

I have, I hope, shown that the idea of a one-to-one correspondence between an increment

of input power

Ed3x in or on the antenna and an increment of radiated power per

J

−

·

19

unit solid angle r2S

ˆr is without merit. Only the total input power can be equated to

·

the total radiated power. Treatment of a tractable, albeit stylized, perfectly conducting

spherical antenna with gap excitation as a boundary value problem illustrates how the

antenna’s current distribution emerges as part of the solution. The ﬁelds right down to

r = a permit calculation of the Poynting vector everywhere outside the antenna. Numerical

examples show how the power ﬂow originates at the gap, is guided near the antenna by the

conducting surface of the antenna, and is launched toward its ultimate radiation pattern

after a few multiples of r/a. With perfect conductivity there is no energy ﬂow into or out

from the antenna’s surfaces. When resistive losses are included, a small radial component of

the Poynting vector occurs at the surface of the antenna, directed inward into the conductor

where it is dissipated in ohmic heating.

The main message is that antennas are boundary value problems, that the “arms” of an

antenna guide and launch the energy ﬂow but are not its origin, and that initial speciﬁcation

of the current for a metallic antenna is not consistent (even if it may yield reasonable results

in some situations).

As a ﬁnal note, the reader should know that there exists canned ﬁnite element analysis

software called NEC4 for computation of ﬁelds and energy ﬂow around antennas of relatively

arbitrary shape. One option is a plot of energy ﬂow lines in which the local density and

direction of lines indicate the magnitude and direction of the ﬂux. Some may prefer that

presentation over my Figures 2 and 4. Personally, I rather like the action implied by the

arrows in my ﬁgures.

APPENDIX A: SURFACE ELECTRIC FIELD AS EXPANSION IN ASSOCI-

ATED LEGENDRE FUNCTIONS

A spherical antenna has a gap in its perfectly conducting surface deﬁned by cos θ1 <

cos θ < cos θ2. The internal source of power creates an electric ﬁeld Eθ at r = a within the

gap, uniformly in azimuth. Otherwise, Eθ = 0 on the surface. The multipole expansion (16)

of Eθ is in terms of the associated Legendre functions P 1

ℓ . We thus require an expansion in

those associated Legendre functions of the rectangular function, f (z) = [Θ(z

of the Legendre functions around θ = π/2, a symmetric equatorial gap implies only odd ℓ

We apply the Ermakov-Lewis procedure to the one-parameter damped modes ˜y recently introduced by Rosu and Reyes,
which are related to the common Newtonian free damping modes y by the general Riccati solution [H.C. Rosu and M. Reyes,
Phys. Rev. E 57, 2850 (1998)]. In particular, we calculate and plot the angle quantities of this approach that can help to
distinguish these modes from the common y modes.

In a previous paper hereafter denoted as I [1], the non-
uniqueness of the factorization of linear second-order dif-
ferential operators has been exploited on the example of
the classical Newtonian free damped oscillator, i.e.

N y ≡ (cid:18) d2

dt2 + 2β

+ ω2

0(cid:19) y = 0 .

The coeﬃcient 2β is the friction constant per unit mass
and ω0 is the natural frequency of the oscillator (SI units
assumed all over the work).

The more general supersymmetric partner equation

has been obtained in I. This new second-order linear
damping equation contains the additional last term with
respect to its initial partner (1), which may be thought of
as the general Darboux transform part of the frequency
[4]. T = 1/γ occurs as a new time scale in the Newtonian
damping problem. If this time scale is inﬁnite, the ordi-
nary free damping is recovered unless for the critical case
which is special even in ordinary damping. As explained
in I, the ˜y modes can be obtained from the y modes by
operatorial means. In the following we shall call them γ
modes. For the three types of free damping they have
been obtained in I as follows:

(i) For underdamping, β2 < ω2
0 − β2 the underdamped γ modes are

pω2
˜yu = − ˜Aue−βthωu sin(ωut + φ) +

cos(ωut + φ)i .

0. The critical γ

(ii) For overdamping, β2 > ω2

the overdamped γ modes are

˜y0 = − ˜Aoe−βthωo sinh(ωot + φ) −

(iii) For critical damping, β2 = ω2

solutions are given by

These are the only possible types of one-parameter
damping modes related to the free damping ones by
means of Witten’s supersymmetric scheme [2] and the
general Riccati solution [3].

In practice the new parameter γ can be very close to
zero. In this case, it is very diﬃcult to diferentiate the
γ modes from the ordinary ones. The only means we
can think of is by recording somehow the geometric an-
gle associated to the γ modes and compare it with the
same quantity in the ordinary damping cases. One is led
to this conclusion noticing that the γ modes have time-
dependent frequencies ω2(t) = ω2
(γt+1)2 and hence
for them the Ermakov-Lewis (EL) procedure can be natu-
rally applied [5] (for a recent review, see [6]). For ω0 6= β,
Eq. (2) can be reduced to a Bessel equation and the so-
lutions can be written as follows

0 − 2γ 2

where τ = γt + 1 and k2 = ω2
. When k → ∞ (i.e.,
γ → 0), we can do Hankel’s asymptotic expansions, i.e.,
of large Bessel argument but ﬁxed Bessel order (we shall
not reproduce these formulas here, the reader is directed
to Abramowitz and Steagun [7]). The point is that one is
indeed able to get the solutions obtained by operatorial
means. Thus, the supersymmetric operatorial procedure
gives merely the asymptotic γ → 0 solutions, which how-
ever could be the most relevant from the physical view-
point in this context.

In the EL approach the angular quantities are given

by the following formulas [6,10]

ney’s nonlinear equation [8]

for C = constant (=1), p(t) = 2β and q(t) = ω2
(γt+1)2 .
For ρ 6= constant there is a deﬁnite prescription of cal-
culating ρ in terms of two independent solutions of the
corresponding linear equation. We have followed the
method of Eliezer and Gray [9] for ρ(t) in terms of linear
combinations of the aforementioned Bessel functions (for
A = B = C = D = 1) that satisfy the initial conditions
as given by those authors. In the critical damping case,
we used the modes of Eq. (5) with Ac = Dc = 1. The
results of the calculations for some particular values of
the parameters are plotted in Figs. 1a,b,c, 2a,b,c, 3a,b,c
for the γ underdamped, overdamped, and critical cases,
respectively. For comparison, the angle quantities for
γ = 0 are displayed in Figs. 1a’,b’,c’, 2a’,b’,c’, 3a’,b’,c’,
respectfully.

It is shown that the total energy of the static “ﬁeld + particle” system, deﬁned in the framework
of classical, renormalized electrodynamics of particles and ﬁelds, depends in an unstable way upon
the ﬁeld boundary data. It is argued that this phenomenon may be also an origin of the unstable
dynamical behaviour of the system (i.e. existence of “runaway solutions”).
It is proved that a
suitable polarization mechanism of the particle restores the stability, at least on the level of statics.
Whether or not it restores also the full, dynamical stability of the theory is still an open question.

INTRODUCTION

Classical electrodynamics in its present form is unable
to describe interaction between charged particles, inter-
mediated by electromagnetic ﬁeld. Indeed, typical well
posed problems of the theory are of the contradictory na-
ture: either we solve partial diﬀerential equations for the
ﬁeld, with particle trajectories providing sources (given
a priori !), or we solve ordinary diﬀerential equations
for the trajectories of test particles, with ﬁelds providing
forces (given a priori !). Combining these two procedures
into a single theory leads to a contradiction: Lorentz
force due to self-interaction is inﬁnite in case of a point
particle.

There were many attempts to overcome these diﬃcul-
ties. One of them consists in using the Lorentz–Dirac
equation (see [1],[3],[10]). Here, an eﬀective force by
which the retarded solution computed for a given par-
ticle trajectory acts on that particle is postulated (the
remaining ﬁeld is ﬁnite and acts by the usual Lorentz
force). Unfortunately, this approach leads to the so called
runaway solutions which are unphysical.

Various remedies have been proposed to cure such dis-
ease, most of them just based on a ﬁne tuning of bound-
ary conditions. Unfortunately, such a tuning excludes
physically interesting problems (i.e. circular motion) and
the question arises if one can construct a theory which
does not contain unphysical solutions at all. The au-
thors believe that to achieve the above goal we should
ﬁrst gain a deeper understanding of foundations of the
runaway behaviour.

As a starting point of our analysis, we use an approach
proposed by one of us in papers [4] and [2]. It consists
in deﬁning an “already renormalized” four-momentum of
the physical system “particle(s) + ﬁelds”. Equations of
motion are then derived as a consequence of the conserva-

∗Electronic address: kosciej@fuw.edu.pl

tion law imposed on this object. We deeply believe that
such an approach is a a correct realization of the Ein-
stein’s programme of “deriving equations of motion from
ﬁeld equations” and that a similar procedure should be
applied to formulate the two-body-problem in General
Relativity Theory.

We show in the present paper, that the physical in-
stability is inherently contained in the renormalization
method used. More precisely: in the simplest renormal-
ization scheme the amount of energy contained “in the
interior of the particle” decreases when the external ﬁeld
surrounding the particle increases. This contradicts the
stability of the model. As a remedy for such drawback
we propose the polarizability of the particle. Numerical
analysis of such an improved model shows validity of this
proposal.

In this paper we analyze the renormalized energy of
the total “particle + ﬁeld” system on the level of statics
only, but the energetic instability discovered this way is
obviously a reason for the runaway behaviour of the dy-
namical system as well. Indeed, the price which must be
paid for acceleration becomes negative. This observation
is fundamental, in our opinion, to understand the physi-
cal reasons for the runaway behaviour of the theory and
in search for a remedy for this phenomenon.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section II the
renormalization procedure proposed by one of us in [4]
(see also [2]) is presented. Then a monopole particle in-
side a ﬁxed volume V is considered: we compute renor-
malized energy of the system and vary it with respect
to particle’s position. Next, we assume that the particle
assumes position corresponding to minimal value of the
energy. In this way we obtain total energy of the system
as a function of the ﬁeld boundary data, imposed on ∂V .
Finally, we analyze stability of the system under small
changes of these data. Here, both the Dirichlet-type and
the Neumann-type boundary problems are considered.

The above general results are then applied to a case of a
monopole particle closed in spherical box. We prove that
such system is not stable. Then we consider a polarizable

2

particle. Here, the external ﬁeld may generate a non-
vanishing dipole momentum, which changes completely
the energy balance. It turns out that for a Heaviside-like
relation between the ﬁeld and the dipole momentum it
generates, the system is stable. This suggests a possible
way to improve in the future our renormalization method
and to avoid (maybe) also dynamical instabilities, mani-
festing themselves in the runaway behaviour.

which becomes extremely useful in the following arrange-
ment. We assume that the straight line which describes
the “trajectory” of the second (uniformly moving) par-
ticle is tangent to the approximate trajectory ζ of the
ﬁrst (i.e. generic) particle at their intersection point with
Σ denotes the ball of radius R, which

contains the strong ﬁeld region of both solutions, but is
small with respect to the characteristic distance of the
external Maxwell ﬁelds, then we have:

Full description of the renormalized electrodynamics
was proposed in [4] or [2]. In the present Section we re-
view brieﬂy heuristic ideas that stand behind deﬁnition of
the renormalized four-momentum of the dynamical “par-
ticle + ﬁeld” system.

As a starting point of our considerations take an
extended-particle model. This means that we consider a
fully relativistic, gauge-invariant, interacting “matter +
electromagnetism” ﬁeld theory, which is possibly highly
non-linear. A moving particle is described by a solution
of the theory, such that the “non-linearity-region” (or
the “strong-ﬁeld-region”) is concentrated in a tiny world
around a smooth, timelike trajectory ζ. We as-
tube
sume that outside of this tube matter ﬁelds practically
vanish and the electromagnetic ﬁeld is suﬃciently weak
to be well described by the linear Maxwell theory. The
four momentum of the total system “particle + ﬁeld” is
obtained by integration of a (conserved – due to Noether
Theorem) total energy-momentum tensor T:

λ =

over a spacelike hyperplane Σ.

We assume, moreover, that this fundamental theory
admits also a static, stable, soliton-like solution, which
will be called a “particle at rest”. Here, the strong-ﬁeld
region (interior of the particle) is assumed to be concen-
trated around the straight line ~x =const. Let m denote
the total energy (mass) of this solution. Due to rela-
tivistic invariance, we have also a six parameter family
of solutions obtained by acting with Poincar´e transfor-
mations on the static solution. Each of these solutions
may be called a “uniformly moving particle”. If the so-
lution has been boosted to the four-velocity uλ and if
T(u) denotes its energy-momentum tensor, then the to-
tal four-momentum of this solution equals muλ and we
have:

ZΣ−K(R)

(Tµ

ZK(R)

(4)

Our assumption about stability of the free particle (soli-
ton solution) means that the last integral is negligible
since inside the particle both solutions are very close to
each other. But the ﬁrst integral contains only contri-
butions from external Maxwell ﬁelds accompanying both
particles. This way we have proved that the following
formula:

muλ +

ZΣ−K(R)

(Tµ

(5)

containing only external Maxwell ﬁeld surrounding the
particle, provides a good approximation of the total four-
momentum of the total “particle + ﬁeld” system.

The theory proposed in [4] consists in mimicking the
above formula in the point particle model. Hence, we
consider solutions of Maxwell equations having a “delta-
like” current corresponding to a point charge e traveling
over a trajectory ζ. Such a solution is treated as an ide-
alized description of external properties of the extended
particle considered above. Denote by T the energy mo-
mentum tensor of this solution. Of course, the uniformly
moving particle, whose four-velocity equals u, is repre-
sented in this picture by a boosted Coulomb ﬁeld, and
its energy-momentum tensor is denoted by T(u). If tra-
jectories of both particles are again tangent with each
other at their common point of intersection with Σ, then
momentum (5) may be rewritten as:

muλ +

≃

ZΣ−K(R)

(T µ

(6)

because outside of the particle T reduces to T and T(u)
reduces to T(u). The main observation done in [4] is that,
due to cancellation of principal singularities of both T
and T(u), the above integration may be extended to the
entire Σ. More precisely, the following quantity:

muλ =

Tµ

λ(u)dσµ .

ZΣ

This leads to a trivial identity:

is well deﬁned (“P ” denotes the “principal value” of the
integral). According to the discussion above, we inter-
pret this quantity as the total four-momentum of the in-
teracting system composed of the point particle and the

Maxwell ﬁeld accompanying the particle. Consequently,
we impose conservation of
as an additional condition.
P
This implies equations of motion of the point particle as
a good approximation of equations of motion of the true,
extended particle.

This approach has an obvious generalization to the sys-
tem of many particles (see [4]). Also polarizable parti-
cles, carrying magnetic or electric moment (and – con-
sequently – displaying stronger ﬁeld singularity than the
Coulomb ﬁeld) may be treated this way (cf. [8]). Re-
cently, the above approach was improved by replacing the
reference Coulomb ﬁeld in (7) by the Born ﬁeld, matching
not only particle’s velocity but also its acceleration. This
way the principal-value-sign “P ” may be omitted in the
deﬁnition because the corresponding integral converges
absolutely (cf. [9]).

In what follows, we are going to apply deﬁnition (7) to

static “particle + ﬁeld” conﬁgurations only.

Given boundary conditions, we are going to minimize

the total “particle+ﬁeld” energy as functions of the ﬁeld
boundary data. Stability of the energy with respect to
the boundary data on ∂V will then be studied. Before
we pass to the above programme, we must specify which
kind of boundary conditions on ∂V have to be controlled.

tribution (in contrast with conventional δ, denoting vari-

D = Dreg + Dsing,

Comparing (16) and (20) we observe that the equilibrium

eφreg(~r0), when the

Dirichlet boundary data are controlled. The quantity
V is the total energy of the “particle + ﬁeld” system,
H
whereas
V is an analog of the free energy in thermo-
dynamics. We conclude that imposing Neumann condi-
tion on the boundary corresponds to the adiabatic insula-
tion of the system, whereas imposing Dirichlet condition
means that we expose it to a kind of a “thermal bath”.
Indeed, imposing e.g. condition φ
∂V = 0 we must cover

the surface ∂V with a metal shell and ground it electri-
cally. This means that we admit energy exchange of our
system with the earth. Similarly as in thermodynamics,
V , which we optimize, contains not only
the free energy

the system’s energy
which we interpret as energy of the “boundary-condition-
controlling device”. Of course, from the point of view of
the particle, both conditions lead to the same equation:
Dreg(xk
0) = 0 because our theory is local and the parti-
cle interacts with its immediate neighbourhood only, no
matter how the boundary data are controlled far away
from the particle.

IV. AN EXAMPLE – MONOPOLE PARTICLE
IN A SPHERICAL BOX

⊂

In this section we shall analyze stability of a charged,
monopole particle closed in a spherical box with radius
R3. Simplicity of the model allows us
R: V = K(0, R)
to solve explicitly the static Maxwell equations (for both
the Neumann and the Dirichlet cases) and to compute
renormalized energy of the system. Then we will ﬁnd
the extremum of the energy function with respect to the
particle’s position and check that for the Neumann case
we get the minimum and for the Dirichlet case – the max-
imum of the energy. Assuming that the particle always
minimizes the energy, we will express energy function in
terms of the boundary data and show that the system is
unstable under small changes of these data.

Observe that for increasing values of q, the energy of the
system decreases (cf. ﬁgure 2)! The system “particle +
ﬁeld” turns out to be unstable – even small ﬂuctuations
of the external ﬁeld q can decrease its total energy. This
means that the particle behaves like a perpetuum mobile,
providing a source of energy at no costs.
In our opin-
ion this unphysical feature of the model, manifestly seen
in its static behaviour, could possibly be a source of its
dynamical instability, i.e. the existence of “runaway” so-
lutions of Dirac equation. As a remedy, described in the
sequel, we propose to equip the particle with an addi-
tional mechanism which, via electric polarizability, will
restore its static stability.

V. POLARIZABLE PARTICLE

We assume that the particle may get a non-vanishing
electric dipole moment due to interaction with the neigh-
boring ﬁeld. We prove in the sequel that, under a suit-
able choice of the polarizability properties of the particle,
the resulting “particle + ﬁeld” system becomes statically
stable.

been generated by the surrounding electric ﬁeld D ac-
cording to some law p = p(Dreg(~r0)), describing the sen-
sitivity of the particle. Moreover, we admit the depen-
dence of the coeﬃcient m in (7) (and, consequently, in
(12)) upon polarization. It will be shown in the sequel
that insisting in having m constant we are not able to
make the model physically consistent. Moreover, it will
be shown that the electric sensitivity is uniquely implied
by the dependence m = m(p).

A. Variational principle

Variation of the renormalized energy (12) with respect
to the particle’s position contains now the non-vanishing
term δm. Similar calculations as for the scalar particle
lead, in case of the Neumann boundary conditions, to
formula:

δ

V = δm +

Plugging (44) into (42) we see that the total energy vari-
ation splits into the sum of two pieces: the work due to
virtual displacement of the particle and the remaining
work, due to variation of m and p:

The second part
m and the moment p depend upon the value of Dreg(~r0).
This quantity must be obtained from the ﬁeld equation:
∆φreg = 0, with boundary value depending upon the
particle’s position. The only way to save locality of the
to vanish identically by
model is to force the term
imposing the following constraint:

B

δm = Dreg(~r0)δp .

(46)

Denoting by m0 = m(0) the mass of the unpolarized
particle and by f (p) the additional polarization energy:

formula (46) may be written as:

m(p) = m0 + f (p) ,

Dreg

k (~r0) =

∂f (p)

(47)

We see that the polarization energy f must play role
of the generating function for the polarizability relation,
otherwise the model would not be local. Indeed, suppose
that
does not vanish and the particle’s equilibrium
condition needs vanishing of the whole right hand side
of (45). To decide whether or not its actual position is
acceptable as an equilibrium position, the particle must
know not only the ﬁeld in its immediate neighbourhood,
but also the shape of V and the ﬁeld boundary data on
∂V . Such a behaviour is physically non acceptable.

Inverting the generating formula (48), we may ﬁnd the
dependence p = p(Dreg(~r0)), which is uniquely implied
by the “equation of state” (47). Hence, we have:

VI. AN EXAMPLE – POLARIZABLE PARTICLE
IN A SPHERICAL BOX

Let us come back to the simple model described in
Section IV on page 4. For the polarizable particle we
must solve the ﬁeld equation:

∆φ =

eδ(~r

~r0) + ~p

(δ(~r

~r0)) ,

−

−

· ∇
K(0, R), with either Neumann (21) or Dirich-
where ~r0 ∈
let condition (22). We want to compute renormalized to-
tal energy of the “particle + ﬁeld” system and to prove
that for a suitable state equation (47) our model becomes
stable.

−

(53)

Splitting the solution φ into two parts:

φ = φmon + φdip ,

(54)

where by φmon we denote the solution of the monopole
problem, found earlier (cf. Section (IV), page 4), we
reduce the problem to equation:

∆φdip = ~p

(δ(~r

~r0)) ,

· ∇

−

(55)

with homogeneous boundary conditions: ~Ddip
r=R = 0
in the Neumann case and φdip
r=R = 0 in the Dirichlet
case. Choosing the axis ez parallel to ~E and passing to
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
spherical coordinates (r, θ, ϕ) we obtain for ~r0 = (r0, 0, 0)
and ~p = pez + pxex (see Appendix D on page 11):

As we already noticed in the monopole case, axial sym-
metry of the problem implies that minimum of the energy
is assumed at the point ~r0 which is parallel to ~E. The
same argument implies that we have px = 0 in this con-
ﬁguration. We are going to limit our analysis to such
conﬁgurations only.

A. Stability

We compute the total, renormalized energy of the sys-

tem as a sum of two parts:

=

dip ,

(59)

H

H
mon denotes the energy of the monopole ﬁeld
where
dip denotes the re-
obtained earlier ((25), page 4), and
maining part, containing energy of the dipole ﬁeld and
the interaction energy. The latter term is computed in
Appendix E (page 13). The ﬁnal result for the Neumann
case, written in terms of standardized variables reads:

Now, stability of the system depends upon the polariz-
ability of the particle, i.e. upon the choice of the “state
function” f (cf. (47) on page 6). At the moment we
have no general criterion which would guarantee stabil-
ity. However, it is easy to show that for:

positive work. Hence, the system is stable under small

B. Conclusions

We have shown that the polarizability of the parti-
cle, described by a suitable “state function” f (e.g. by
(61)), may be a good remedy for the static instability
of the renormalized electrodynamics of point particles.
Whether or not this will cure also the dynamical insta-
bility, i.e. the existence of “runaway” solutions, is another
question which we would like to study in the nearest fu-
ture.

At the moment the bifurcation phenomenon occurring
near the ground state q = 0 is worthwhile to study. Ob-
serve that the point ~r0 = 0, corresponding to q = 0
and described by the purely monopole ﬁeld, is not sta-
ble. This conﬁguration corresponds to a local maximum
of the energy and belongs to the unstable branch of sta-
tionary points, described by the function

The easiest way to calculate this derivative is to use
spherical coordinates ~r0 = (r0, θ0, ϕ0). Then:

z0 = r0 cos θ0 ,

for ~r0 ∦ ez and then pass to the limit θ0 →

function cos γ, where γ is the angle between ~r and ~r0,
i.e.:

~r0 = rr0 cos γ ,

(D14)

or, equivalently:

cos γ = cos θ cos θ0 + sin θ sin θ0 cos(ϕ

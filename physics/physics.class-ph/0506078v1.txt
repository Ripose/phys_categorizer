We calculate the Cherenkov radiation from an e+e−
pair
at small separations, as occurs shortly after a pair conversion.
The radiation is reduced (compared to that from two indepen-
dent particles) when the pair separation is smaller than the
wavelength of the emitted light. We estimate the reduction in
light in large electromagnetic showers, and discuss the impli-
cations for detectors that observe Cherenkov radiation from
showers in the Earth’s atmosphere, as well as in oceans and
Antarctic ice.

I. INTRODUCTION

Cherenkov radiation from relativistic particles has
been known for over 70 years [1]. However, to date, al-
most all studies have concentrated on the radiation from
individual particles. Frank [2], Eidman [3] and Balazs
[4] considered the Cherenkov radiation from electric and
magnetic dipoles, but only in the limit of vanishing sep-
arations d. Their work was nicely reviewed by Jelley [5].
Several more recent calculations have considered
Cherenkov radiation from entire electromagnetic show-
ers, in the coherent or almost coherent limit [6]. The
ﬁelds from the e+ and e− largely cancel, and the bulk of
the coherent radiation is due to the net excess of e− over
e+ (the Askaryan eﬀect) [7]. Hadronic showers produce
radiation through the same mechanism [8]. Coherent ra-
diation occurs when the wavelength of the radiation is
large compared to the radial extent of the shower; for
real materials, this only occurs for radio waves.

Here, we consider another case, the reduction of ra-
diation from slightly-separated oppositely-charged co-
moving pairs. This includes e+e− pairs produced by
photon conversion. When high-energy photons convert
to e+e− pairs, the pair opening angle is small and the e+
and e− separate slowly.

Near the pair, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds from the
e+ and e− must be considered separately. However, for
an observer far away from the pair (compared to the pair
separation d), the electric and magnetic ﬁelds from the e+
and e− largely cancel. Cherenkov radiation is produced
at a distance of the order of the photon wavelength Λ
from the charged particle trajectory. So, for d < Λ, can-
cellation reduces the Cherenkov radiation from a pair to
below that for two independent particles. For a typical
pair opening angle m/k, where k is the photon energy
and m the electron mass, without multiple scattering,
Λ > d for a distance kΛ/m. For blue light (Λ = 400
nm) from a 1 TeV pair, the radiation is reduced until

the pair travels a distance of 40 cm (neglecting multiple
scattering).

In this paper, after a more detailed calculation of the
Cherenkov radiation from e+e− pairs, we consider co-
herent optical radiation from pairs that follow realistic
trajectories, and from electromagnetic showers. We con-
sider two classes of experiments: underwater/in-ice neu-
trino observatories and air Cherenkov telescopes.

II. CHERENKOV RADIATION FROM PAIRS

Cherenkov radiation from closely spaced e+e− pairs
can be derived by extending the derivation for point
charges, by replacing a point charge with an oppositely
charged, separated pair. We sketch the derivation for
radiation from point charges, review previous work on
radiation from inﬁnitesimal dipoles, and derive the ex-
pression for Cherenkov radiation from a closely-spaced
co-moving pair.

We follow the notation and derivation from Ref. [9]. In
Fourier space, the charge density ρ and current ~J from
a point charge ze propagating with speed v in the x1
direction can be written as

ze

ρ(~k, ω) =

where ~k is the wave vector and ω the photon energy. This
current deposits energy into the medium through elec-
tromagnetic interactions. We use Maxwell’s equations
beyond a radius a around the particle track, where a is
comparable to the average atomic separation. Then, by
conservation of energy, the Cherenkov radiation power is
equal to the the energy ﬂow through a cylinder of this
radius, giving

Note how a has dropped out [9, Ch. 13]. The derivation
of this Cherenkov radiation may be expanded to give the
ﬁeld from an pair.

The radiation from an e+e− pairs depends on two pa-
rameters: the separation d and the angle between the
direction of motion and the orientation of the pair. For
relativistic pairs created by photon conversion, the trans-
verse (to the direction of motion) separation is important;
the longitudinal separation of a highly relativistic pair
can be neglected, due to Lorentz length contraction.

Balazs [4] provided an expression for Cherenkov radi-
ation from an inﬁnitesimal dipole D oriented transverse
to its momentum. These ﬁelds are well approximated by
by a linear Taylor expansion of the corresponding point-
charge ﬁelds:

The dE/dx falls to zero for β
1, whereas in the perpen-

this is due to Lorentz contraction.

To compute the Cherenkov radiation for ﬁnite separa-
tions d, let us consider a pair moving in the +x direction.
The pair lies entirely in the transverse plane y-z, with the
line between them making an angle α with respect to the
y-axis. Then, generalizing Eq. (1), the charge density
from the pair is

At α =
π/2 E1(ω) = 0. The Cherenkov radiation is
no longer symmetric about the direction of motion, and
vanishes at right angles to the direction of the dipole. As
the charge separation increases (or the wavelength de-
creases), the angular distribution evolves from two wide
lobes into a many-lobed structure, as shown in Fig. 1.
After integration over even a narrow range of ω or d, the
angular distribution becomes an almost-complete disk,
with two narrow zeroes remaining at a direction perpen-
dicular to the dipole vector.

considered independently, and the dashed lines are for pairs

treated coherently, with separations 100 nm, 1 µm and 5 µm.

For the remainder of the paper, we assume that media
satisfy
ǫ(ω) = n, where n is independent of frequency.
In realistic detection media, any variation of n with fre-
quency is small, and would have little eﬀect on Cherenkov
radiation from relativistic particles.

p

With real e+e− pairs, two eﬀects should be consid-
ered. Radiation is not emitted instantaneously, but over
a period known as the formation time, τ = 1/cλ. If the
pair separation varies signiﬁcantly during this time, loss
of longitudinal coherence may reduce the radiation. This
may be signiﬁcant when the change in λd is of order one.
Where the coherence is important, cτ and d are compa-
rable, and the e+ and e− follow roughly parallel tracks,
so d will not change signiﬁcantly during the formation
time.

Second, the Cherenkov radiation produced at a point
(x-coordinate) depends on the ﬁelds emitted by the
charged particles at earlier times, when d may be dif-
ferent than at the point of radiation. For full rigor, these
retarded separations should be used in the calculation.
Again, this has a negligible eﬀect on the results.

III. RADIATION FROM e+e− PAIRS IN
SHOWERS

Many experiments study Cherenkov radiation from
large electromagnetic showers. The radiation from a
shower may be less than would be expected if every parti-
cle were treated as independent. We use a simple simula-
tion to consider 300 to 800 nm radiation from electromag-

L

netic showers. This frequency range is typical for pho-
tomultiplier based Cherenkov detectors; at longer wave-
length, there is little radiation, while shorter wavelength
light is absorbed by the glass in the phototube.

E±(1

We simulated 1000 γ conversions to e+e− pairs with
total energies from 108 to 1020 eV. Pairs were pro-
duced with the energy partitioned between the e+ and
e− following the Bethe-Heitler diﬀerential cross section
dσ
E±), where E± is the electron (or positron
energy) [11]. At high energies in dense media (above 1016
eV in water or ice), the LPM eﬀect becomes important,
and more asymmetric pairs predominate [10]. The pairs
are generated with initial opening angle of m/k; the ﬁxed
angle is a simpliﬁcation, but the pair separation is domi-
nated by multiple scattering, so it has little eﬀect on our
results.

The e− and e+ are tracked through a water medium
(with n = √ǫ = 1.3) in steps of 0.02X0, where X0 is the
radiation length. At each step, the particles multiple-
scatter, following a Gaussian approximation [12, Ch. 27].
The particles radiate bremsstrahlung photons, using a
simpliﬁed model where photon emission follows a Pois-
son distribution, with mean free path X0. Although this
model has almost no soft bremsstrahlung, soft emission
has little eﬀect on Cherenkov radiation, since the electron
or positron velocity is only slightly aﬀected.

At each step, we compute the Cherenkov radiation for
each pair. They are treated coherently when the d < 2Λ;
at larger separations the particles radiate independently.

pair in water, relative to emission from two independent par-
ticles.

As shown in Fig. 3, the particles in lower energy pairs
(< 1010 eV) radiate almost independently. In contrast,
the radiation from very high energy pairs (> 1015 eV) is
largely suppressed. The broad excursions slightly above
unity occur when J0(λd) > 1 for many of the scattered
pairs.

IV. IMPLICATIONS FOR EXPERIMENTS

At least two types of astrophysical observatories de-
pend on Cherenkov radiation. Water and ice based neu-
trino observatories observe Cherenkov radiation from the
charged particles produced in neutrino interactions, and
air Cherenkov telescopes look for γ-ray induced electro-
magnetic showers in the Earth’s atmosphere.

≈

Current neutrino observatories can search for electron
neutrinos with energies above 50 TeV (for νµ, the thresh-
old is much lower) [14]. They use large arrays of photo-
multiplier tubes to observe the Cherenkov radiation from
νe induced showers. For water, n
1.3, and Fig. 3 shows
that λd < 1 while the pair travels signiﬁcant distances.
Ice is similar to water, with a slightly lower density; n of
1.29 [16].
ice depends on its structure, and is typically
To quantify the eﬀect of Cherenkov radiation from νe
interactions, we use a toy model of an electromagnetic
shower. The shower evolves through generations, with
each generation having twice as many particles as the
preceding generation, with half the energy. Each gen-
eration evolves over a distance of X0; other simulations
have evolved generations over a shorter distance (ln 2)X0,
leading to a more compact shower [15]. In these showers,
most of the particles are produced in the last radiation
lengths.

≈

Fig. 4 shows the Cherenkov radiation expected from a
model 1020 eV shower with coherent Cherenkov radiation
(solid line) and in a model where all particles radiate in-
dependently (dotted line). This model does not include
the LPM eﬀect, so it should be considered only illustra-
tive. The LPM eﬀect lengthens the high-energy (above
1017 eV) portion of the shower. By spreading out the
shower longitudinally, the LPM eﬀect will give the elec-
trons and positrons more time to separate, and so will
somewhat lessen the diﬀerence between the two results.
However, it is clear from Fig. 4 that coherence has a sig-
22X0. Since the front of the
niﬁcant eﬀect for the ﬁrst
shower contains relatively few particles, it will not aﬀect
the measured energy. However, by suppressing radiation
from the front of the shower, it could aﬀect the measure-
ment of the shower development and the reconstruction
of the shower position. This eﬀect can only be assessed
with a detailed model of a particular experiment.

≈

Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes like the Whipple
observatory study astrophysical γ-rays with energies
from 100 GeV to 10 TeV. These telescopes observe
Cherenkov radiation from pairs in the upper atmosphere;
for a 1 TeV shower, the maximum particle density occurs
at an altitude of 8 km above sea level (asl) [13], where the
1 depends
density is about 1/3 that at sea level. Since n
−
10−4, so for
linearly on the density, at 8 km asl n
500 nm photons radiated from ultra-relativistic particles,
λd < 1 only for d < 6 µm. In this low-density medium,
the eﬀect of the pair opening angle is signiﬁcant and mul-
tiple scattering is less important. Pairs with k < 1 TeV
will separate by 30 µm in a distance less than 30 meters;

at 8 km asl, this is 3% of a radiation length. This dis-
tance is too short to aﬀect the radiation pattern from the
shower.

Cherenkov radiation is also studied in lead-glass block
calorimetry, and in Cherenkov counters for particle iden-
tiﬁcation; their response to photon conversions may be
aﬀected by this coherence.

impact parameter to cause ionization of a medium, the
electric ﬁelds from the e+ and e− will largely cancel, and
the energy loss will be reduced.

V. CONCLUSION

We have calculated the Cherenkov radiation from e+e−
pairs as a function of the pair separation d. When d2 <
v2/(ω2[1
β2ǫ(ω)]), the radiation is suppressed compared
to that from two independent particles.

−

This suppression aﬀects the radiation from electromag-
netic showers in dense media. Although the total radi-
ation from a shower is not aﬀected, emission from the
front part of the shower is greatly reduced; this will af-
fect studies of the shower development, and may aﬀect
measurements of the position of the shower.

Abstract. We show how the quasi-analytic method developed to solve linear elastic
contacts to coated substrates (Perriot A. and Barthel E. J. Mat. Res., 2004, 19,
600) may be extended to adhesive contacts. Substrate inhomogeneity lifts accidental
degeneracies and highlights the general structure of the adhesive contact theory. We
explicit the variation of the contact variables due to substrate inhomogeneity. The
relation to other approaches based on Finite Element analysis is discussed.

In elastic contact problems, it is known that the homogeneous substrate is a special case
which leads to counterintuitive results. As an example, for adhesionless contacts, the
relation between penetration δ and contact radius a is independent from the mechanical
ν2))
parameters (Young’s modulus E, Poisson ratio ν, reduced modulus E⋆ = E/(1
and can be in all generality expressed as a function of the shape of the contacting bodies
z(r) only.

Obviously, the reduced modulus is absent and one might conclude that the relation
has a geometrical origin. To show that this is not the case, one needs only remove
the assumption of homogeneous substrate. Then, for a coated substrate, for instance,
the penetration will again depend upon the mechanical parameters of the system, in a
highly non trivial manner [1]. Overlooking the more complex penetration dependence
upon contact radius might actually result in inaccuracies in the determination of thin
ﬁlm mechanical properties by nanoindentation [2, 3, 4, 5].

For instance, for a rigid cone of half included angle β in frictionless contact with

an elastic substrate:

Similarly, for adhesive contacts, a counterintuitive result is that the adhesion force
or pull-out force Fpullout for a sphere of radius R and adhesion energy w is independent
from the mechanical parameters. It is valued

Fpullout = nπwR

where various n values have been proposed such as 1 [6], 3/2 [7] or 2 [8].

However, changing the geometry from sphere to cone [9] or removing the assumption
of a homogeneous substrate, for example with a coated substrate [10, 11], again results
in reintroducing the dependence upon mechanical parameters.

With the idea that the real structure of the elastic contact models only appears when
considering a non homogeneous substrate, the present contribution aims at: 1) showing
how the recently developed quasi analytical method for contacts to coated substrates [1]
may be used to account for adhesion as previously used by Mary et al. [12] 2) exploring
how the diﬀerent concepts developed for homogeneous adhesive contacts may be applied
to a non homogeneous system, to wit, a coated substrate.

Section 2 reviews the various concepts which have been developed to establish the
relation between macroscopic contact variables F , δ and a and the physical phenomena
of adhesion. Section 3 describes the surface stress transform method pioneered by
Sneddon. Section 4 explores the application of the method to the adhesive contact to a
homogeneous substrate, while section 5 explores the application of the method to coated
substrates.

2. Adhesive elastic contact concepts and previous results on coated
substrates

2.1. Elastic adhesive contact - problem description

the surface
Contact problems are characterized by mixed boundary conditions:
displacement is speciﬁed inside the contact zone and the normal stress at the surface
outside. Note that this normal stress outside the contact zone is zero, except at the
edge of the contact zone where more or less long range adhesive surface forces develop
in the so-called interaction zone (Fig. 1).

Three concepts have been developed to handle these complex boundary conditions,
provide a solution and establish relations between the macroscopic variables F , δ and
a.

2.2. Three concepts to solve the adhesive elastic contact problem

2.2.1. Energy minimization The ﬁrst method disregards the contact edge details,
assumes a given form for the surface stresses inside the contact zone and calculates the
solution parameters by energy minimization, taking into account the adhesion energy
w as a πwa2 term. This macroscopic approach was implemented as early as 1934, when
Derjaguin assumed a Hertz-like stress distribution and combined it with an adhesion
energy contribution proportional to the contact area, which resulted [6] in a pull-out
force given by n = 1 in Eq. 2.

Based on elastomer adhesion experiments, a more realistic surface deformation built
up from the addition of a ﬂat punch displacement to the Hertz solution resulted in the
where n = 3/2 in Eq. 2. This model, now generally accepted for soft
JKR model [7]

Note that an early version of this model can be found in the appendix of G. Sperling’s PhD thesis [13],

solids, provides a more consistent description of the stresses inside the contact zone than
the original 1934 result.

More generally, a formal method to minimize the total energy with regards to
the contact radius a naturally leads to introducing the energy release rate, a concept
borrowed from fracture mechanics : if
is the stored elastic energy, the energy release
rate G can be deﬁned in an axisymmetric geometry as

E

(3)

Such an approach was used for instance as an alternative derivation of the JKR model
in [14].

2.2.2. Stress intensity factor The second method is to focus on the crack-like stress
singularity at the contact edge. It is described in terms of the stress intensity factor.
The relation between the energy release rate and the stress intensity factor was initially
proposed by Irwin [15]. In the ﬁeld of the adhesive contact, this second method was
mainly propounded by Maugis [9, 16, 17]. It is particularly useful for direct extensions
of the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics where a description in terms of stresses at the
crack tip is necessary: for instance, it may be used to include crack tip viscoelasticity
[16, 17, 18].

2.2.3. Exact solution The third method is actually more general: it takes into account
the details of the attractive stress distribution outside the contact zone. This idea
was somehow initiated by the DMT model [8] (n = 2 in Eq. 2) but was brought to
a new dimension by the introduction of a cohesive zone model by Maugis [19], which
resulted in a clear exposition of the transition between the two limiting models JKR
and DMT. It also led to the development of the fully viscoelastic adhesive contact
models [20, 21]. In these models, stress relaxation inside the contact zone – as in the
adhesionless viscoelastic contact by Ting [22] – and creep inside the interaction zone –
as in the viscoelastic crack models [16, 17, 18] – are taken into account simultaneously.
Just as the viscoelastic case extends the adhesive contact model from instantaneous
response to time dependent constitutive relation, the coated substrate generalizes the
model to an inhomogeneous half space. Our interest here will however be limited to
the small cohesive zone sizes, located on the JKR side of the transition, which connect
this approach to the previous two. For an extension to the JKR-DMT transition with
a coated substrate, when the interaction zone grows to extensions comparable or larger
than the ﬁlm thickness, in the spirit of the Maugis model, see [23].

where it stands as a curiosity, not as the ”Theorie der Haftung” developped in the body of the text,
which mainly deals with surface roughness and plastic deformation.

2.3. Review of previous results on the adhesive contact to coated substrates

On the theoretical side, the literature on the adhesive contact to coated substrates
is scanty, although, in practice, thin soft adhesive layers are often used, as in many
applications of pressure sensitive adhesives and functional or protective organic coatings.
Actually only two series of papers by Shull and coworkers [24, 25] on one side and
Johnson and Sridhar [10, 11] on the other side have been published.

Shull and coworkers calculate the energy release rate from the contact compliance
(cf. 5.2.2). To complete the calculations, the compliance of coated sustrates are
computed by Finite Element (FE) methods and phenomenological ﬁts or numerical
diﬀerentiation may be carried out.

Johnson and Sridhar’s approach goes along the line of the stress intensity factor
(section 2.2.2) approach: still using FE, they directly calculate the energy release rate
G by a stiﬀness matrix variation method [26] and extract stress intensity factors from
G. From this stress intensity factor, they build the adhesive contact relations.

Both methods converge on their ultimate use of Finite Element calculations to
handle the complexities of the coated substrate response. Appearances to the contrary,
these two series of papers seem actually to rely on the same method and an in depth
investigation of the Parks method in the context of the frictionless contact would
probably connect the stiﬀness matrix derivative used by Parks to the contact stiﬀness
derivative method as developped by Shull.

In the present paper, we show that the quasi-analytical method introduced
previously [1] may be used to eﬃciently compute all the necessary contact variables
and in particular provide direct numerical evaluations for the stress intensity factor for
coated substrates. It is also useful to expose the equivalence of the various concepts for
the adhesive contact in the wider context of non-homogeneous substrates.

3. Sneddon and the surface stress transform

Adequate transforms facilitate the investigation of linear elastic axisymmetric contacts
formulated as integral equations [27]. It is ideally suited to the adhesive contacts because
of the relevant boundary conditions including the interaction zone.

Following our previous studies [20, 21, 28, 29], we use g(r), which is a transform of

the normal stress distribution at the surface σz deﬁned as

and θ(r) which is a transform of the normal surface displacement uz deﬁned by

These relations are suited to the adhesive contact problem because g(r) is expressed

the interaction zone.

through

The full power of these transforms appears when it is recognized [20, 21] that in
the linear elastic case and for a homogeneous substrate, mechanical equilibrium results
in

This provides the direct solution to the adhesive contact problem which we detail

now.

4. Adhesive contacts on homogeneous substrates

Before tackling the problem of the adhesion to coated substrates we review our
present understanding of elastic contacts to homogeneous substrates using the transform
method.

4.1. Non adhesive contact of smooth indenters

In the absence of adhesion, Eq. 4 shows that g(a) = 0. If the indenter shape z(r) is
smooth at the contact edge, then Eqs. 6 and 8 imply θ(a) = 0 and

δ = δ0(a)

Thus the indenter penetration in an adhesionless contact is the function δ0(a),
which depends only upon the geometry of the indenter (Eq. 7) and not on the elastic
parameters. This is the counterintuitive result stated in section 1.

4.2. Non adhesive contact of ﬂat punches

A special case however is the ﬂat punch for which δ0(r) = 0 for r < a and g(r) = 0
for r > a. The penetration is independent of the contact radius as expected since the
contact radius is constant, equal to the punch radius.
Then θ(a−) = δ so that g(a+) = 0 and g(a−)

= 0. The exact meaning of this

discontinuity in the g transform at a will be discussed below (section 4.4.2).

Note also that the force can be obtained through the simple but general

expression [29]

with

4.3. Adhesive contacts

In the adhesive case, however, although the indenter shape is smooth at the contact
edges, the condition g(a) = 0 is relaxed due to the adhesive interactions. The core
of the JKR approximation is to neglect the details of the stresses and deformations at
the contact edge and encapsulate the adhesive contribution in an additional ﬂat punch
displacement. This amounts to a description where the attractive interaction stresses
drop abruptly to zero outside the contact zone, leading to a stress singularity akin to
those met in fracture mechanics.
Then Eqs. 9 and 11 become

δ = δ0 + δf p
F = F0 + S(a)δf p

The question is to provide a relation between this additional ﬂat punch displacement

δf p and the adhesion energy w for a given contact radius a.

4.4. Various concepts for the derivation of adhesive contact results

For future reference, we now apply the surface stress transform solution to the three
methods developed to handle adhesive contacts (section 2.2).

4.4.1. Energy Release Rate A very compact derivation is obtained when it is recognized
that for a homogeneous substrate g et θ are independent of a inside the contact zone.

The energy release rate G(a) can be expressed as a function of the local stress

distribution at the crack tip because of Eq. 4 and g(r) = 0 for r > a.

where it has been assumed that g is smooth except for a discontinuity at a. We use the
notation g(a−) = g(a) and assume g(a+) = 0. Then

which conﬁrms that g(a) has the form and meaning of a stress intensity factor.

As a stress intensity factor, g(a) is a measure of stress singularity at the contact
edge. An ancillary property of the transform deﬁned by Eq. 4 is that it regularizes
the singular crack like stress distributions and Eq. 5 establishes a relation between the
additional ﬂat punch penetration and the stress singularity through

4.4.3. Self-consistent method The self-consistent description of the interaction zone
[19, 28, 30] can be explored at the limit of negligible interaction zone extension, i.e. in
the JKR limit.

One possible starting point of the self-consistent method [28, 29] is to calculate the

adhesion energy by

Following [21](Eq 15) the gap between the surfaces h is split into the contributions of
the contact stresses and the interaction stresses

h(r) = hHertz(r, a) + hint(r, a)

If the interaction range is small (which results in c
a << a), the radial extension of the
interaction will also be small, g′ is peaked around a, and the dominant term in Eq. 24
will be the ∂uz,int/∂s term. Thus [29],

5. Coated Substrates – Thin Films

5.1. Description of the contact

If the substrate is not homogeneous the simple diagonal equilibrium relation Eq. 8
between g and θ is lost. However, keeping the same transforms, we have shown [1] that
a useful relation subsists

θ(r; a, t, [E]) =

g(s; a, t, [E])K(r, s; t, [E])ds (32)

2g(r; a, t, [E])

where K expresses the elastic response of the coated substrate [1], t stands for the coating
thickness and [E] for the four mechanical parameters (ﬁlm and substrate Young’s moduli
and Poisson ratios). Since g is zero outside the contact zone, the upper boundary will
typically be the contact radius a or the interaction zone radius c if c
= a. The ﬁnite
integration interval facilitates the numerical inversion [1] of Eq. 32. Note that direct
analytical inversion is impossible because of the complex expression for K.

We now split the stress distribution and the displacement ﬁeld into their non

adhesive δH and ﬂat punch δf p components.

For the non adhesive contact of an indenter of regular shape, the penetration is

given by

where δ0(r) reﬂects the indenter shape and gH(a; a, t, [E]) = 0 in the absence of adhesion,
ensuring a unique solution. Eq. 34 generalizes Eq. 15 and introduces the non-trivial
relation mentioned in section 1.

For the contact of the ﬂat punch the problem is linear with δf p and

∝

Then the penetration for the adhesive contact of an indenter of arbitrary shape is

δ(a, t, [E]) = δH(a, t, [E]) + δf p

With the following deﬁnition of the contact stiﬀness

S(a, t, [E]) =

Ff p(a, t, [E])
δf p

the force is

F (a, t, [E]) = FH(a, t, [E]) + S(a, t, [E])δf p

Equations 36 and 38 generalize Eqs. 15 and 14. Here again, the question is to
provide a relation between the additional ﬂat punch displacement δf p and the adhesive
interaction.

5.2. Derivation

For coated substrates, the resolution beneﬁts from more general expressions derived for
viscoelastic adhesive contacts [31]. This is not fortuitous but results from a similar
breakdown of the simpliﬁed relations derived through Eq. 8 when spatial heterogeneity
or time dependence is introduced.

because G(a) is calculated at constant displacement so that inside the contact zone,
the surface displacement – and therefore θ(r) – are unaﬀected by the additional stress
distribution g(a): there is only a stress rearrangement inside the contact zone which
does aﬀect g(r), r < a for a coated substrate: indeed the local relation Eq. 8 between g
and θ breaks down in this case.

Following Mary et al. [12], one can show that this non local contribution is actually

canceled by the non local contribution included in the g(a)θ(a) term. For s < a

The region aﬀected by the crack tip stresses extend over a distance commensurate
with the interaction zone size, i.e. it is smaller than the ﬁlm thickness so that the energy
release rate is controlled by the ﬁlm compliance.

5.2.2. Compliance Method The compliance formulation is at the core of the method
used by Shull and coworkers but the derivation given in some of their earlier papers
was obscured by unnecessary assumptions. This formulation emerges readily when
in
Eq. 39 is expressed as a function of strain instead of stress

E

.

We split the total stress and strain ﬁelds in their non adhesive (gH and θH )
and ﬂat punch components (gf p and θf p). This allows for easy integration because
θf p(r; a, t, [E]) = δf p is independent of r. Using Betti’s theorem to calculate the cross
terms

section 4.4.2 is indendent of the material properties and only results from the deﬁnition
of the transform g. It is therefore unchanged in the more general case and the pending
problem is actually the relation between g(a) and the energy release rate G.

The local response is indeed dominated by the local stress distribution and the

about the identity of the stiﬀness deﬁned by Eq. 51 and the stiﬀness deﬁned by Eq. 37. That this
identity does hold for a non homogeneous substrate is shown in the appendix (section 8. It is due to
the absence of adhesion: the normal stress at the edge of the contact is zero so that contact radius
variation does not result in force variation, to ﬁrst order.

This is a remarkable result which one should in principle be able to derive from Eq. 35.
Note however that the present quasi-analytical method [1] simultaneously provides
the ﬂat punch stiﬀness and and contact edge stress singularity g(a) (or the stiﬀness
derivative through Eq. 35) by the simple resolution of a linear system.

5.4. Normalized Solution

The procedure to compute a full force curve for the adhesive contact to coated substrates
is therefore: for a given value of the contact radius a

(i) compute the adhesionless penetration and force for the given indenter shape

(ii) compute the force and stress intensity factor (or g(a)) for the ﬂat punch for a unit

(iii) compute actual value of g(a) from Eq. 57 and rescale ﬂat punch force and

value of the penetration

penetration

(iv) compute the solution from Eqs. 36 and 38

This provides the solution under the form of two relations between the local
deformation (stress intensity factor) and the local response on the one hand and the
remote loading and the macroscopic response (contact stiﬀness) on the other hand.

Γ(˜r; ˜a, t, [E]) is the surface stress transform normalized to penetration δ.
In

the ﬁlm elastic properties – at identical δf p value. The variable Γ(1), which is positive
since both δf p and g(a) are negative in Eq. 63, is a function of ˜a, and depends upon the
mechanical parameters of the system. From Eq. 52 the following identity holds:

The thin ﬁlm contact problem exhibits a transition between ﬁlm dominated to
substrate dominated behaviour. In each limit cases, the contact behaves like a contact
to a homogeneous system. The non trivial behaviour is apparent in the transition which,
roughly speaking, occurs for ˜a
1, but is shifted to higher values for compliant ﬁlms
(Fig. 3) and to lower values for stiﬀ ﬁlms (Fig. 4) [1].

eq exhibits a transition between ﬁlm to substrate reduced modulus as the contact

6.2. Adhesive contact solutions

E

The reduced variables Πs(˜a, t, [E]), ∆s(˜a, t, [E]),
eq(˜a, t, [E]) and Γ(1) = Γ(˜a; ˜a, t, [E])
provide the normalized solution (Eqs. 66 and 67) as a function of η for a set of mechanical
parameters. It is worth emphasizing that – provided the reduced variables have been
calculated on a wide enough range of values of ˜a = a/t – the solution for any values of
contact radius, ﬁlm thickness and adhesion energy can be calculated from the reduced
variables through the elementary arithmetics of the normalization Eqs. 66 and 67. This
should provide for an easy algorithm to ﬁt experimental data for adhesive contact on
thin ﬁlms.

Results for various values of η are displayed on Fig. 5 and 6 for E1

For a coated substrate in the presence of adhesion, the system undergoes two
transitions. The ﬁrst one is is the transition between coating and substrate response [1],
when ˜a
1 as described in the previous section. The second one is the transition from
adhesion dominated to non adhesive contact as the load and therefore the contact radius
increase [34]. This transition occurs when ¯a
1. The deviation from the JKR results
occur when the two transitions are simultaneous, i.e. when η

Explicitly, for large values of η (i.e. thick ﬁlms), the adhesive stage of the contact
will occur for small ˜a and the contact is ﬁlm dominated and behaves as a homogeneous
material with the mechanical parameters of the ﬁlm.

≃

For small values of η (i.e. thick ﬁlms), the adhesive stage occurs for large ˜a and the
contact is substrate dominated: the contact behaves as a homogeneous material with the
mechanical parameters of the substrate. However, at the edge of the contact, this contact
is not equivalent to an adhesive contact to a homogeneous material with substrate
Indeed, the stress intensity factor is dominated by the ﬁlm properties

(Eq. 57).

As a result, moderate deviations on the pull-out force are evidenced. For soft layers,
the adhesion force is enhanced [11]. For rigid layers there is a small reduction of the
adhesion force

.
††

This is not, however, the reason why on soft materials a rigid layer may drastically reduce the
††
adhesion, which is often due to the suppression of non elastic additional dissipation phenomena. Note
that here the adhesive force reduction is accompanied by an increase of the stress intensity factor.

7. Conclusion

The surface stress transform is adequate to handle the adhesive contact to coated
substrates.
It provides a numerically simple method to compute the four quantities
necessary for the actual description of such adhesive contacts. For a given layer and
substrate mechanical properties, ﬁts to data with free adhesion energies and coating
thicknesses may be performed easily. It also allows a consistent description of the crack
tip which connects the various concepts developed in adhesive contact problems.

The method also allows the inclusion of ﬁnite indenter stiﬀness, a question which

arises in practice and which will be studied in more details in a subsequent paper.

8. Appendix: contact stiﬀness and ﬂat punch stiﬀness

The identity of the contact stiﬀnesses deﬁned by Eq. 37 and by Eq. 51 may look
questionable: is the contact stiﬀness for an adhesionless curved indenter identical with
the ﬂat punch stiﬀness for an identical contact radius, even for an inhomogeneous
substrate ?

Since the curved indenter is adhesionless, g(a) = 0. Then from Eq. 10 we have

Fig. 1: schematics of an adhesive contact: the contact zone (radius a) is surrounded
by the interaction zone. The gap between surfaces outside of the contact zone is h(r).
The normal stress distribution turns from compressive at the center of the contact to
tensile on both sides of the contact edge. The transform θ(r1) is calculated from the
normal surface displacement at r < r1. The transform g(r2) is calculated from the
normal surface stress for r > r2.

as the variation with contact radius a of the stored elastic energy at constant total
penetration δ (shaded area).

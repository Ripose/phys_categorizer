In this work, a sensitivity of the rate of relaxation of ground-state atomic coherences to magnetic-
ﬁeld inhomogeneities is studied. Such coherences give rise to many interesting phenomena in light-
atom interactions, and their lifetimes are a limiting factor for achieving better sensitivity, resolution
or contrast in many applications. For atoms contained in a vapor cell, some of the coherence-
relaxation mechanisms are related to magnetic-ﬁeld inhomogeneities. We present a simple model
describing relaxation due to such inhomogeneities in a buﬀer-gas-free anti-relaxation coated cell. A
relation is given between relaxation rate and magnetic-ﬁeld inhomogeneities including the depen-
dence on cell size and atomic spices. Experimental results, which conﬁrm predictions of the model,
are presented. Diﬀerent regimes, in which the relaxation rate is equally sensitive to the gradients
in any direction and in which it is insensitive to gradients transverse to the bias magnetic ﬁeld, are
predicted and demonstrated experimentally.

INTRODUCTION

In recent years, there has been a considerable interest
in many physical phenomena associated with the exis-
tence of coherence between atomic states. Such coher-
ences, induced and detected by light, form the basis of
certain nonlinear optical eﬀects and are essential in such
applications as magnetometry [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], electro-
magnetically induced transparency [7, 8], and quantum
gates [9]. They are also extensively employed in tests
of fundamental symmetries (see, for example, reviews
[10, 11]) and in frequency standards [12].

The lifetime of atomic coherences involving excited
atomic states is generally limited to twice the time re-
quired for spontaneous emission of a photon and tran-
sition to a lower state. On the other hand, for coher-
ences between atomic ground states the eﬀective coher-
ence lifetime τ is either determined by the interaction
time between the light and atoms, or by the time be-
tween coherence-destroying collisions. In many applica-
tions, the longer the lifetime of the coherences, the better
resolution, contrast or sensitivity that can be achieved.
In a typical experiment, involving a single light beam
and a glass cell containing only alkali-metal vapor at low
pressure, the eﬀective coherence lifetime is given by the

transit time of the atoms through the light beam. In or-
der to suppress coherences-destroying collisions of atoms
with cell walls and increase the lifetime τ , one of two
methods is employed. The ﬁrst method is to add to the
cell a buﬀer (usually noble) gas at relatively high pres-
sure. Since in the ﬁrst approximation the collisions with
the buﬀer gas are elastic, τ is then given by the time
for the alkali atoms to diﬀuse from the light beam. The
second method is to apply an anti-relaxation coating to
the inner walls of the cell, preventing spin-depolarizing
collisions of the atoms with the walls. This allows atoms
to leave the light beam and later return to it with the
coherences intact. Using these methods the coherence
lifetimes have been prolonged to hundreds of milliseconds
(see, for example Refs.
[13, 14] and references therein).
As wall relaxation is decreased, however, other sources
of relaxation become important, such as spin-exchange
self-collisions and magnetic-ﬁeld gradients, of which the
latter is discussed here.

The sensitivity of the rate of relaxation γ of the
ground-state coherences (γ = 1/τ ) to magnetic-ﬁeld in-
homogeneities was previously studied under diﬀerent ex-
perimental conditions [15, 16, 17, 18].
In a series of
papers [15] the sensitivity of the relaxation rate to the
magnetic-ﬁeld gradients was studied in anti-relaxation

coated cells. Theoretical predictions supported by nu-
merical simulations were compared with data obtained in
a high-resolution Zeeman spectroscopy experiment per-
formed with relatively strong bias magnetic ﬁeld B = 50
G. In such range of magnetic ﬁelds, the nonlinear Zee-
man eﬀect signiﬁcantly contributes to relaxation and it
cannot be neglected. In Refs. [16, 17, 18] the sensitivity
of the relaxation rate γ to the magnetic-ﬁeld gradients
in a buﬀer-gas cell was studied both theoretically and
experimentally.

|

In this work the rate of relaxation due to magnetic-
ﬁeld inhomogeneity is studied in buﬀer-gas-free anti-
relaxation coated cells at relatively low magnetic ﬁelds
(
< 160 mG), where the inﬂuence of the nonlinear
B
|
Zeeman eﬀect on relaxation is negligible. A naive the-
oretical model of the sensitivity of the relaxation rate
to the magnetic-ﬁeld inhomogeneity is given. A rela-
tion between the sensitivity of the relaxation rate and
size and atomic spice contained in a cell
is derived.
Experimentally, the problem is studied using nonlinear
magneto-optical rotation with frequency-modulated light
(FM NMOR) [6]. The sensitivity of the FM NMOR reso-
nances to ﬁrst-order magnetic-ﬁeld gradients is analyzed
and compared with the model predictions. The sensi-
tivity to the magnetic-ﬁeld gradients is studied for dif-
ferent bias magnetic ﬁelds. This enables observation of
two diﬀerent regimes, one in which the rate of relaxation
γ depends equally on the magnetic-ﬁeld inhomogeneities
in each direction and the other, in which it is completely
insensitive to the transverse inhomogeneities.

The article is organized as follows. In Section II the
theoretical model of the sensitivity of the rate of relax-
ation to the magnetic-ﬁeld inhomogeneities is given. The
experimental apparatus and the measurement technique
are described in Section III.
In Section IV the experi-
mental results are presented and compared with the pre-
dictions of the model. Conclusions are summarized in
Section V.

II. THEORETICAL MODEL

Consider atoms contained in a buﬀer-gas-free, anti-
relaxation-coated spherical cell of radius R. Since at
room temperature at saturated alkali-vapor densities an
atom’s mean free path is on the order of hundreds of
meters, the atoms travel freely between collisions with
the cell walls. To analyze the inﬂuence of magnetic-ﬁeld
inhomogeneities on the rate of relaxation of the ground-
state coherences, we use a simple model for a ﬁrst-order
magnetic-ﬁeld gradient, for example, ∂Bi/∂xi, in which
the gradient ﬁeld in each half of the cell is replaced by
a constant magnetic ﬁeld ∆Bi in that half.
In other
words, the cell is considered to have the magnetic ﬁeld
∆Bi = (3R/8)(∂Bi/∂xi) for xi > 0 and the opposite ﬁeld
∆Bi for xi < 0. At this point we assume that ∆Bi is
−
the only magnetic ﬁeld inside the cell. However, the ef-
fect of homogenous bias magnetic ﬁeld B is considered

below.

Between wall collisions, the atomic spins precess due

to the magnetic ﬁeld and acquire an average phase

φgrad

≈

gµB∆Biτc
~

,

where g is the Land´e factor, µB is the Bohr magneton,
and τc
4R/3v is the average time between two collisions
and v is the r.m.s. atomic thermal velocity. However,
since acquiring the phase is a random process the actual
phases acquired by the atom vary between collisions.

≈

Another source of random phase is inelastic wall colli-
sions. A simple model of wall-collision relaxation is the
following. During a collision with the wall, an atom is
stuck to the surface for approximately 10−10 s [19] (note
10−12 s), and
that the duration of an elastic collision is
is then released in a random direction with a random ve-
locity. During the time it spends on the surface the atom
feels an excess magnetic ﬁeld Bwall. This ﬁeld causes
the atomic spin to rotate, producing an average phase
shift φwall. Combining the phases due to the magnetic-
ﬁeld inhomogeneity and wall collisions for N successive
bounces in quadrature, the total phase is

∼

(φtotal)2 = N

(φgrad)2 + (φwall)2

.

(2)

A characteristic relaxation time corresponds to a de-
crease of initial spin polarization by a factor of e. One
can show that this happens when φtotal = √2, and thus
the total number of wall collisions before dephasing Nγ
is

Nγ =

√2
(φgrad)2 + (φwall)2 .

The relaxation rate γ of the atoms can be written as

In the two limiting cases in which only one mechanism
of relaxation is present, Eq. (4) takes the forms

γ =

where Ngrad and Nwall are respectively the numbers of
bounces before relaxation when only the gradient relax-
ation or the wall relaxation is present. It is noteworthy
that including other relaxation mechanisms such as spin-
exchange collisions does not change the present treat-
ment.

where ξ = 3µ2
of relaxation due to magnetic-ﬁeld gradients depends
quadratically on the inhomogeneity of the magnetic ﬁeld
(∂Bi/∂xi)2, scales as R3, and depends on the atomic
species through the g2 dependence.

≪

≫

Now, we consider the eﬀect of the homogenous bias
magnetic ﬁeld B, leading to a Larmor precession fre-
quency ΩL = gµBB. In this situation we consider two
regimes: (1) ΩLR/v
1, in which atomic spins rotate
by only a small angle between collisions with the cell
walls and (2) ΩLR/v
1, in which the spins rotate by a
large angle between successive wall bounces. In the ﬁrst
regime, since small rotations commute, i.e., the result of
the composite rotation does not depend on the order of
rotations, the spins’ precession around orthogonal com-
ponents of the magnetic ﬁeld can be, to a good approx-
imation, considered as independent. Thus, comparable
sensitivity to longitudinal and transverse magnetic-ﬁeld
gradients can be expected. In the second regime the Lar-
mor precession is rapid and the strong bias magnetic ﬁeld
breaks the symmetry of the system. Since ﬁelds trans-
verse to the strong bias ﬁelds are only second order cor-
rections to the total magnetic ﬁeld, the sensitivities of
atomic-polarization relaxation rates to longitudinal and
transverse magnetic-ﬁeld gradients are diﬀerent.

In the limit of high bias ﬁeld, one would expect the re-
laxation rate to become completely insensitive to trans-
verse gradients. However, according to Maxwell’s equa-
tions generation of a magnetic-ﬁeld gradient in one di-
B = 0).
rection requires gradients in other directions (
Thus, in conditions of our experiment, when a gradient
transverse to the light propagation direction is applied
(say ∂By/∂y), a gradient ∂Bx/∂x given by

∇ ·

also appears along the longitudinal direction x. Since the
relaxation is quadratic in the magnetic-ﬁeld gradient, it
is expected that the relaxation rate should be four times
as sensitive to gradients nominally along the longitudinal
direction as they are to those nominally in a transverse
direction.

III. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Relaxation rates may be studied by observing the
widths of resonances in optical rotation using the FM
NMOR technique [6]. The layout of the experimental
setup is shown in Fig. 1. Rubidium atoms are con-
tained in anti-relaxation-coated buﬀer-gas-free spherical
vapor cells of diﬀerent diameters and containing diﬀer-
ent isotopic compositions of rubidium (Table I). A cell is
placed inside a four-layer magnetic shield providing pas-
sive attenuation of the DC magnetic ﬁelds to the level of
one part per 106 [20]. A set of three mutually orthogo-
nal magnetic-ﬁeld coils is mounted inside the innermost
shielding layer. These coils are used for compensation

maximum FM NMOR signal in each case. The central
frequency of the laser is stabilized with a dichroic atomic
vapor lock [21, 22] modiﬁed for operation with frequency-
modulated light. The rotation of the polarization plane
of the light transmitted through the coated vapor cell is
analyzed with a balanced polarimeter (a crystalline po-
larizer rotated by 45◦ in the yz-plane and two photodi-
ode detectors). A photodiode diﬀerence signal is detected
with a lock-in ampliﬁer at the ﬁrst harmonic of Ωm. In-
phase and quadrature components of the detected signal
are stored with a computer.

IV. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

A typical in-phase FM NMOR signal recorded as a
function of a modulation frequency is shown in Fig. 2.
Experimental data were ﬁt with a dispersive Lorenzian.
The width of the FM NMOR signal ∆ν, which corre-
sponds to the relaxation rate of the ground-state coher-
∆ν, is half of the distance
ences γ by the relation γ = 2π
between two peaks in the signal.

In Fig. 3 the dependence of the rate of relaxation of the
ground-state coherences γ is presented as a function of
the magnetic-ﬁeld gradients applied with x coils. In order
to verify the predictions of the model the experimental

and γ0 is the relaxation rate in the absence of the gradi-
ents. As seen in Fig. 3 the experimental data are in good
agreement with the theoretically predicted quadratic de-
pendence of the relaxation rate as a function of the
magnetic-ﬁeld gradient. The agreement was also ob-
served for two transverse directions y and z.

The sensitivities to the magnetic-ﬁeld gradients were
also studied as a function of the strength of the bias
magnetic ﬁeld. The ratios between sensitivities to gra-
dients applied with x, y, and z coils are shown in Fig.
4. The sensitivity to the gradients applied with either
of the transverse coils is the same (ay/az
1) over the
whole range of bias magnetic ﬁelds, as expected by sym-
metry. However, as predicted in Sec. II, the ratio be-

≈

→

tween the sensitivity to magnetic-ﬁeld gradients applied
with the longitudinal and transverse coils changes with
the strength of the bias magnetic ﬁeld. In the zero-ﬁeld
limit of the bias ﬁeld the sensitivity to the magnetic-ﬁeld
gradients applied with the longitudinal and either of the
transverse coils is the same (ax/ay
1).
For stronger bias ﬁelds the ratio between the sensitivity
to the ﬁrst-order magnetic-ﬁeld gradients applied with
the longitudinal and transverse coils increases until it
levels oﬀ at ax/ay
4 for B > 15 mG. These
results are in agreement with the theory, which predicts
1, and along/atrans = 4
along/atrans = 1 for ΩLR/v
1. For the experimental conditions of Fig.
for ΩLR/v
4, 15 mG corresponds to ΩLR/v
3. Thus the exper-
imental results conﬁrm that for high bias ﬁelds the rate
of relaxation γ is insensitive to the transverse part of the
magnetic-ﬁeld inhomogeneities.

gradients varies with the orientation of the coils used for
generation of the gradients, cell size and rubidium iso-
tope.

As seen in Table II, the sensitivity to the gradients in
larger cells is stronger than in the smaller cell. According
to Eq. (7), the sensitivity to the magnetic-ﬁeld gradients
scales as R3. In order to check this, Table III gives the
experimentally measured ratios for cells of diﬀerent sizes
along with the theoretical predictions. The experimental
data are consistent with the predictions of the model.

According to the model, the FM NMOR width scales
with Land´e factor as g2 [Eq. (7)]. For the two isotopes
of rubidium, 85Rb and 87Rb, for which the Land´e fac-
tors are 1/3 and 1/2, respectively, the expected ratio is
4/9. Rough agreement is seen between the experimental
results and predictions for the ratios of sensitivities for
cells containing diﬀerent isotopes (Table IV). The results
in Table IV are scaled to take into account the diﬀerent
cell sizes. For the results relating the Ale10 and Gibb
cells, we associate a diﬀerence from the theoretical value
with the slightly nonspherical shape of the Gibb cell (in
addition to the overall non-sphericity, it does not have a
typical stem but it has a number of tubulations). An-

gradients.

V. CONCLUSION

We have presented a simple model describing a
relation between the relaxation rate of the ground-
state coherences γ of atoms contained in buﬀer-gas-free
anti-relaxation-coated cell and magnetic-ﬁeld inhomo-
geneities. The results of the experiments using nonlin-
ear magneto-optical rotation with frequency-modulated
light have conﬁrmed the model across the board. We
showed that the rate of relaxation γ of the ground-state
Zeeman coherences is proportional to the square of the
magnetic-ﬁeld inhomogeneity (ﬁrst-order magnetic-ﬁeld
gradients), and that it scales as the cube of the cell size
and as the square of the Land´e factor. Additionally, we
provide experimental evidence that the sensitivity to the
longitudinal part of the magnetic-ﬁeld inhomogeneity is
independent of bias magnetic ﬁeld, but the sensitivity
to the transverse part of the inhomogeneity changes with
bias ﬁeld. At small bias ﬁelds the sensitivity to transverse
inhomogeneities is similar to the sensitivity in the longi-
tudinal direction, but at larger ﬁelds (where the Zeeman
frequency exceeds the wall-collision rate), it vanishes.

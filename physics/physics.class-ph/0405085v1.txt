A version of electrodynamics is constructed in which faster-than-light motions of electro-
magnetic ﬁelds and particles with real masses are possible.

Introduction

·

For certainty, by faster-than-light motions we shall understand the motions with velocities v >
3

108 m/sec. The existence of such motions is the question discussed in modern physics.
As already as in 1946–1948 Blokhintsev [1] paid attention to the possibility of formulating the
ﬁeld theory that allows propagation of faster-than-light (superluminal) interactions outside the
light cone. Some time later he also noted the possibility of the existence of superluminal solutions
in nonlinear equations of electrodynamics [2]. Kirzhnits [3] showed that a particle possessing the
tensor of mass M i
) can move
k = diag (m0, m1, m1, m1), i, k = 0, 1, 2, 3, gab = diag (+,
faster-than-light, if m0 > m1. Terletsky [4] introduced into theoretical physics the particles with
imaging rest masses moving faster-than-light. Feinberg [5] named these particles tachyons and
described their main properties.

Research on superluminal tachyon motions opened up additional opportunities which were
studied by many authors, for example by Bilaniuk and Sudarshan [6], Recami [7], Mignani (see
[7]), Kirzhnits and Sazonov [8], Corben (see [7]), Patty [9], Oleinik [10]. It has led to original
scientiﬁc direction (several hundred publications). The tachyon movements may formally be
described by Special Relativity (SR) expanded to the domain of motions s2 < 0. For comparison,
the standard theory describes motions on the light cone s2 = 0 and in the domain s2 > 0 when

The publications are also known in which the violation of invariance of the speed of light
is considered [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. One can note, for example, Pauli monograph [11]
where elements of Ritz and Abraham theory are presented; Logunov’s lectures [12] in which SR
formulation in aﬃne space was given; Glashow’s paper [13] discussing experimental consequences
of the violation of Lorentz-invariance in astrophysics; publications [14, 15, 16, 17] on the violation
of invariance of the speed of light in SR.

A version of the theory permitting faster-than-light motions of electromagnetic ﬁelds and

charged particles with real masses is proposed below as continuation of such investigations.

2 Formal construction of the theory

Let us introduce the space-time R4, metric properties of which may depend on the velocity of
a particle being investigated and take the metric of R4 in the form:

Here x, y, z are the spatial coordinates, t is the time, c0, c′

of light, v is the velocity of a body under study with respect to the reference frame K. Let us
connect the co-moving frame K ′ with this body. Let the proper speed of light be invariant

As a result, the common time similar to Newton one may be introduced on the trajectory of the

a free particle does not depend on t and x. The velocity of light (4) is a constant in this case.

The expressions for ∂/∂y and ∂/∂z are analogous to the expression ∂/∂x. Further we restrict
ourselves by the case of positive values of the velocities of light and by studying a variant of
the theory in which the velocity of light in the range of interactions may only depend on the
c = c(x0). The relationship between x0 and t may be deduced from the
time “t”, i.e. c = c(t)

Let us note some features of motions in this case.
1. As in SR, the parameter β = V /c in the present work is in the range 0

2. As in SR, the value dx0 is the exact diﬀerential in view of the condition
3. As distinct from SR, the “time” x0 = ct in the present work is a function of the time t
only for the case of a free particle. In the range of interaction the velocity of light may depend
on time t, and the value x0 becomes the functional (5) of the function c(t).

c = 0.

4. The parameter β = V /c of the transformations (8) may be constant not only at the constant
β = V (t)/c0(1 +
2)1/2 = const < 1, which is not in contradiction with V = V (t), c = c(t). This property
k from (7) for constructing Lorentz invariants in the range of

velocity of light, but also with c = c(t).
v2(t)/c0
permits one to use the matrix Li

Indeed we may accept that 0

5. The condition (10) is invariant on the trajectory of a particle because t′ = t in this case.

In spite of the similarity, the action (11) diﬀers from the action of SR [18]. The current
density was taken in the form ji = (ρ, ρu) = (ρ, ρv/c) instead of ji = (ρ, ρv) [18]. The
electromagnetic ﬁeld was taken in the form E =
φ instead
− ∇
of E =
φ [18]. The current density in (11) is similar to the one from Pauli
monograph [11] with the only diﬀerence that the 3-current density in (11) is ρv/c instead of
being ρv/c0 [11]. Analogously, the velocity of 4-potential propagation in (11) is c from (4)
instead of c0 in [18].

In addition to Lorentz-invariance [18], the action (11) is also invariant with respect to any

Michelson experiment. Negative result of the Michelson experiment for an observer with a
terrestrial source of light (the reference frame K, the speed of light c0) may be explained by space
isotropy. Since the speed of light c0 is the same in all directions, a shift of the interference pattern
is absent with the interferometer’s rotation. Analogously, in the case of an extraterrestrial source
(the reference frame K ′
the star moving inertialy with a velocity v relatively to the Earth),
−
the velocity of light from the star c = c0(1 + v2/c0
2)1/2 is the same for an observer on the Earth.
As a result, the interference pattern does not change with the interferometer’s rotation [17].

Aberration of light. By analogy with SR [11, 18] for one-half of the aberration angle
20.5(1 + zω)/(1 + zλ) [17]. Here
(in arc seconds) we have: sin α = V /c, α
V nx)c/c0
zω = (c

wavelength respectively. It follows from here, for quasar Q1158 + 4635 with zλ = 4.73 (Carswell
and Hewett, 1990) we obtain at nx =

Appearance of atmospheric µ-mesons near the surface of the Earth. Since the
time dilatation is absent in the present work, the appearance of air µ-mesons near the surface
of the Earth could be explained by faster-than-light motion of the mesons with velocity of the

Tests to check independence of the speed of light from the velocity of light source.
It is, for example, Bonch–Bruevich–Molchanov (1956) experiment, in which the velocities of light
radiated by the eastern and western equatorial edges of the solar disk were compared; Sadeh
experiment (1963) in which the velocities of γ-quanta, arising as a result of the electron-positron
annihilation in ﬂight, were compared; Filippas–Fox experiment (1964), where the eﬀect of the
velocity of fast π0-meson on the velocities of γ-quanta from decay π0
γ + γ were investigated.
In view of independence of the velocity of light (4) from the direction of emission of light
relatively to the vector of velocity v of a light source (the solar disk, center-of-mass of electron
and positron, π0-meson) the result in such type of experiments should be negative [17].

Decay of unstable particles. Because of the equality of the rest energy of particles in SR
and in the present work, the condition of spontaneous decay of the particles into fragments is the

Creation of new particles. Let us consider the reaction of antiproton creation in the

4 Conclusion

1 invariant theory has been constructed, where L6 is the Lorentz group,

The L6
1 is the scale
transformation group of the velocity of light c′ = γc. In accordance with Blokhintsev papers
[1] we may assume that the proposed theory may prove to be useful in the ﬁeld of particles
physics, when the elementary particle is not a point but possesses some dimensions. Indeed, the
elementary particles should be points in the L6 invariant theory (SR) because of the ﬁniteness
1 theory this requirement is not necessary because of the
of the speed of light c0. In the L6
absence of the limit to the velocity of light c. The postulation c′ = c leads to SR.

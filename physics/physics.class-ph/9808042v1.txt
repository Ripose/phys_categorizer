Abstract

Classical Stokes’ drift is the small time-averaged drift velocity of suspended non-

diﬀusing particles in a ﬂuid due to the presence of a wave. We consider the eﬀect

of adding diﬀusion to the motion of the particles, and show in particular that a non-

zero time-averaged drift velocity exists in general even when the classical Stokes’ drift

is zero. Our results are obtained from a general procedure for calculating ensemble-

averaged Lagrangian mean velocities for motion that is close to Brownian, and are

veriﬁed by numerical simulations in the case of sinusoidal forcing.

PACS numbers: 02.50-r, 05.40+j, 05.60+w

A travelling wave in a ﬂuid gives suspended particles a small drift velocity known as

Stokes’ drift [1, 2, 3]. When there is more than one wave, the drift velocity is calculated by

summing the contributions from each wave [4, 5]. In this letter we consider the inﬂuence of

diﬀusion on the magnitude and direction of the drift velocity. As in the classical (diﬀusion-

less) case, the amplitude of the travelling wave is assumed small compared to its wavelength;

1

a non-zero drift velocity appears at second order in the amplitude. In the presence of more

than one wave, the classical Stokes’ drift can sum to zero. Diﬀusion then produces a non-

zero drift velocity whose magnitude and direction depends on the diﬀusivity of the suspended

particles.

Several mechanisms for the directed motion of small particles without a net macroscopic

force have been proposed in the last 10 years [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

Interest in such ‘ratchet’

eﬀects has been motivated by the search for the mechanisms of biological motors, such

as the conversion of chemical energy into directed motion by protein molecules, and by

possible applications, such as the separation of particles in solution based on their diﬀusion

coeﬃcients.

In both these cases small particles are believed to follow dynamics that are

overdamped (ﬁrst derivative in time) and noise-dominated. A drift velocity dependent on the

size of suspended particles in solution has been produced experimentally using an asymmetric

periodic potential turned on and oﬀ periodically [11]. Published theoretical models [12, 13]

combine a periodic asymmetric potential in one dimension with non-white ﬂuctuations.

In this letter we consider motion in arbitrary dimensions that is diﬀusion-dominated.

There is also a small deterministic forcing whose amplitude will be used as an expansion

parameter; a drift velocity appears at second order and depends on the diﬀusivity. Thus

diﬀusion due to microscopic motions, for example diﬀusion of particles in solution, can be

exploited using a carefully-chosen combination of forcings to produce a net motion that

depends on the diﬀusivity. We illustrate the eﬀect with sinusoidal forcing and compare our

calculations with numerical results in one and two space dimensions. It is possible to arrange

the wave motions so that particles of diﬀerent diﬀusivities have a time-averaged drift velocity

in diﬀerent directions, resulting in what we call ‘fan-out’. This may have applications for

sorting particles according to their diﬀusivities. We show numerically that the fan-out can

have an angular range of more than 180 degrees.

We ﬁrst develop an expansion scheme for motion that is overdamped and diﬀusion-
dominated. Consider a stochastic process X ≡ (Xt)t≥0 taking values in IRm and satisfying

2

the following stochastic diﬀerential equation [14, 15]:

dXt = ǫf (Xt, t)dt + dWt,

0 ≤ ǫ ≪ 1.

(1)

The vector Xt is the particle position at time t. Its ensemble average, to be denoted below

by angled brackets, is the Lagrangian mean position at time t. W is an m-dimensional

Brownian motion, with W0 = 0 and hWt · Wti = mσ2t, i.e. W represents a purely diﬀusive

The remaining term in (1) is the deterministic forcing, a function of Eulerian position x and

motion, with diﬀusivity

f : IRm × IR+ → IRm.

The real constant ǫ satisﬁes 0 ≤ ǫ ≪ 1.

We now expand in powers of ǫ. Let

In the classical derivation of Stokes’ drift there is no motion at zeroth order [1, 2]. Here

the motion at zeroth order is purely diﬀusive, with hX(0)

t i = 0 for any positive time. When

f (x, t) is a sum of functions that are periodic in t at any ﬁxed x, the drift velocity also

vanishes at ﬁrst order in ǫ. That is

At second-order the drift velocity is in general non-zero. It is given by the following ensemble

We now consider the case where the deterministic forcing is a sum of sinusoids:

(15)

where Aℓ and ωℓ are constants. The vector kℓ deﬁnes the direction of propagation of wave l.

Each wave makes a contribution to the drift velocity in its direction of propagation. For

D = 0, the weighting factor is proportional to the square of the amplitude. This is the

classical result obtained by a transformation from Eulerian to Lagrangian coordinates [1, 2].

In the case of a surface wave over deep water, the ﬁrst order motion of a suspended particle is

a circle with radius Aℓkℓ/ωℓ; the quantity A2

ℓ |kℓ|2kℓ/ωℓ is proportional to the time-averaged

momentum per unit area [2, 3]. In the presence of diﬀusion, the contribution from wave ℓ

is reduced by the dimensionless factor (1 + α2

ℓ )−1, where αℓ = D|kℓ|2ω−1

ℓ

. Diﬀusion reduces

the Stokes drift due to any one wave by smearing out the distribution of particles, working

against the tendency of particles to spend longer in regions where the force acts in the

direction of propagation than in those where the force acts in the opposite direction. The

attenuation is strongest for waves with large wavenumbers or small velocities.

Dependence of drift velocity on diﬀusion can be exploited as follows: there is in general

a non-zero drift velocity due to diﬀusion even when the classical Stokes’ drift is zero. We

write the drift velocity (16) as a sum of the classical Stokes’ drift and a diﬀusion-dependent

contribution:

The classical Stokes drift U0 can be made to vanish by choosing a forcing f (x, t) consisting

of two wave trains propagating in opposite directions. For the latter example, we can work

in one space dimension, deﬁned as the direction of propagation of wave ℓ = 1:

f (x, t) = A1k1 cos(k1x − ω1t + φ1) + A2k2 cos(k2x − ω2t + φ2),

(20)

where Ai, ki, ωi and φi (i = 1, 2) are constants and k1k2 < 0. For simplicity, we suppose

that k1 6= ±k2 and ω1 6= ±ω2; this avoids cross-terms in the classical Stokes’ drift. The drift

velocity including diﬀusion is then given by

For large diﬀusivity the drift velocity tends to zero because the contribution of each wave

tends to zero. Thus there is an intermediate value of diﬀusivity that maximises Us. If the

forcing frequencies and wavenumbers are ﬁxed and U0 = 0, the drift attains its maximum at

the value of D satisfying α1α2 = 1.

Figure 1 shows the drift velocity as a function of diﬀusivity with the forcing a sum of two

sinusoids for a choice of parameters that gives U0 = 0. In Figure 2 the calculated drift is

compared with numerical results, with the same choice of parameters and D = 0.125. The

solid line in Figure 2(a) is the mean value of Xt as a function of time, averaged over 10000

numerical realizations of the stochastic diﬀerential equation (1), and the dotted line is Ut,

with U given by (22). In Figure 2(b) we show, as a function of time, the diﬀerence between

the numerically-calculated mean displacement and Ut. Figure 2(c) demonstrates that the

motion is close to Brownian; a histogram of values of Xt at t = 1000, R(y), is compared

with the Gaussian probability density function with mean Ut and variance σ2t (solid line).

In general the expressions (16) and (19) are vector relations. Thus, in more than one

space dimension, the direction as well as the magnitude of the drift velocity depends on the

diﬀusivity, producing fan-out of the drift velocity vectors. We illustrate this eﬀect in Figure

3, constructed with the forcing being a sum of four sinusoids in two dimensions. In (a), the

vector Aℓkℓ is shown for each of the four waves. The parameters are A1 = 1.0, A2 = 0.8,

A3 = 0.7, A4 = 0.7; k1 = (1.0, 0.0), k2 = (2.0, −4.0), k3 = (−3.0, 0.7), k4 = (−0.96, 4.56).

We take ω = vk with v = 1. Figure 3(b) depicts the fan-out in the directions and magnitudes

of the drift velocities for nine diﬀerent values of diﬀusivity. Each arrow is Us for one of the

6

following values of D: D = 0.1 (leftmost arrow), 0.2 . . . 0.9 (rightmost arrow). For larger

values of D, the direction of U approaches more closely that of k1.

The fan-out eﬀect shown in Figure 3 is due to the diﬀerent rates at which the contribution

from waves decreases as the diﬀusivity is increased, destroying the exact cancellation imposed

at D = 0. More light is shed by considering the small-diﬀusivity and large-diﬀusivity limits

of (19).

In the limit of small diﬀusivity (1) the drift velocity is proportional to D2 and the direction

is approximately opposite to that of the wave with the largest value of A2|k|6ω−3. In the

opposite limit (2) the drift velocity is proportional to D−2 and the direction is approximately

parallel to that of the wave with the largest value of A2ω|k|−2.

In summary, we derive a general expression for the drift velocity of diﬀusing particles from

a stochastic asymptotic expansion scheme for motion that is Brownian plus a small deter-

ministic forcing. The drift velocity is in general non-zero even when the classical Stokes’ drift

vanishes. For example, several counterpropagating sinusoidal forcings produce a drift veloc-

ity that depends on the diﬀusion coeﬃcient and the intensities, frequencies and wavenumbers

of the forcings. Thus, given a collection of particles with diﬀerent diﬀusivities, the deter-

ministic forcings can be tuned to separate particles of a particular type by optimizing their

stochastic Stokes’ drift.

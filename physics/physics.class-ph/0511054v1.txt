Not So Classical Mechanics – Unexpected Symmetries of

Classical Motion

James T. Wheeler

Department of Physics, Utah State University, Logan, UT 84322-4415

A survey of topics of recent interest in Hamiltonian and Lagrangian dynamical

systems, including accessible discussions of regularization of the central force prob-

lem; inequivalent Lagrangians and Hamiltonians; constants of central force motion; a

general discussion of higher-order Lagrangians and Hamiltonians with examples from

Bohmian quantum mechanics, the Korteweg-de Vries equation and the logistic equa-

tion; gauge theories of Newtonian mechanics; classical spin, Grassmann numbers,

and pseudomechanics.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The study of classical mechanics is vast and ancient. Therefore, this collection of results,

observations and questions necessarily omits most of the ﬁeld and probably misses a num-

ber of older references even for topics covered in detail. We focus principally on issues of

symmetry and subjects (old and new) which have appeared in the literature within recent

decades. Nor should it be thought that we provide a complete survey of even the results we

do discuss. Instead, our references for each topic are probably suﬃcient for the interested

reader to gain a foothold on the relevant research.

Of course, the list of topics we do not examine is extensive. Certain topics such as

nonlinear dynamics receive only a brief mention as an example of a higher order system in

Section 5. We have chosen to omit any discussion of electromagnetism while touching on

special and general relativity only to provide examples. Since our presentation is intended

for a broad audience, we have also avoided the large body of formal work. Thus, while the

formal study of symplectic manifolds, Kahler manifolds, Poincar´e sections and so on make

heavy use of modern diﬀerential geometry and ﬁeld theory techniques, little mention is made

of progress in these directions.

What remains is nonetheless ﬁlled with fascinating and diverse surprises in a ﬁeld often

2

mistaken to be complete. Thus, what we do cover is a wide array of topics ranging from the

Kepler problem to supersymmetry. The unifying theme, if there is one, is the occurrence

of unexpected and surprising symmetries in classical physics, and especially in Lagrangian

and Hamiltonian dynamics. Though we treat a few topics simply because there is recent

reference to them in the literature, most of the topics concern symmetry in one way or

another. The uses vary greatly, from the use of anticommuting numbers to the rotation

group, from unusual constants of motion of the Kepler problem to the inﬁnite hierarchy

of constants of motion of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. An additional guiding

principle has been to treat topics that may not be familiar to many readers.

Curiously, quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory have had a strong impact on cur-

rent work in classical physics. As a result, a brief discussion of quantum mechanics appears

in our examination of inequivalent Lagrangians in Section 3 and Bohmian quantum mechan-

ics is discussed in Section 5. Further connections between quantum and classical mechanics

are suggested in our treatment of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics as gauge theories

in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 owes its entire existence to insights from supersymmetric

quantum ﬁeld theory.

The organization of the paper is simultaneously from old to new and from easy to diﬃ-

cult. Section 2 provides a warm-up exercise with some new thoughts on an old topic – the

regularization of the central force problem. From there we move gradually to more recent

and more mathematically challenging questions. In Section 3 we discuss inequivalent La-

grangians and Hamiltonians, a topic which begins with Lie and Dirac (if not earlier) and

which received considerable new input in the 70s. Through the same period, old knowledge

resurfaced with the rediscovery of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz and Hamilton vectors. A deriva-

tion of these rediscovered constants of the motion is given in Section 4, using a technique

based on an old theorem. While the theorem will no doubt be familiar to mathematicians,

its simple application to ﬁnding constants of the motion does not appear in classical physics

Moving to more active areas of current interest, we look at the occurrence of higher

order diﬀerential equations in classical physics. After a brief general introduction to these

systems at the beginning of Section 5 is an example of such equations – Bohmian quantum

textbooks.

mechanics.

The ﬁnal two Sections deal with truly contemporary insights. In Section 6, a development

3

of both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics as gauge theories shows an interesting new

connection between classical physics and conformal symmetry. Then, in Section 7, two

further developments of ﬁeld theory – spinors and anticommuting variables – are discussed

in the context of particle mechanics. The KdV equation and the approach to chaos are

treated in Appendices.

Before embarking, a few general comments are in order. First, observe that each section

below is essentially independent of the others. Each section has its own brief introduction

and references. Note that the end of most sections we have tried to provide a few stimulating

questions. These questions do not reﬂect any consensus thinking and should not be taken

to be the deﬁnitive puzzles facing the ﬁeld. Rather, they are suggestions of some directions

which might or might not prove fruitful. Finally, it should be noted that where derivations

are given without citation, we have produced original calculations. We make no further

mention of this fact since it is probable that many or all of these calculations have already

appeared somewhere within the last few hundred years!

II. REGULARIZATION OF THE CENTRAL FORCE PROBLEM

We begin with some of the oldest problems of classical physics. In this Section and the

next, we explore some interesting features of the Kepler problem and other central force

motion.

In this Section, we examine regularizations of the Kepler problem.

In the next

section we present a technique for ﬁnding constants of the motion [1], then, as an example,

use the technique to ﬁnd some recently rediscovered constants of the Kepler problem [2].

Regularizations of dynamical problems are transformations that turn the equations of

motion into a simpler or less singular mechanical problem. Euler [3] and Levi-Civita [4] pro-

duced one- and two-dimensional regularizations, respectively, of the Kepler problem. These

regularizations turn the Kepler/Coulomb equation of motion into an isotropic oscillator. It

is not surprising that this is possible, because the transformations are time-dependent. In-

deed, using similar transformations, it is possible locally to turn any central force problem

into the isotropic oscillator. We present a general proof of this claim below. The Euler and

Levi-Civita results are special cases.

There are some recent discussions in the literature extending these regularizations. Since

the Levi-Civita result makes use of a complex variable, some authors have explored the

4

idea that the use of a vector space which is also a number ﬁeld gives insights into the

problem. Thus, Kustaanheimo and Stiefel ([5],[6],[7]) give a quaternionic transformation

from the 3-dim Kepler problem to a constrained 4-dim isotropic oscillator, thereby show-

ing that bounded Kepler orbits have an underlying SO(4) symmetry. Bartsch [8] writes

the Kustaanheimo-Steifel result in terms of Hestenes’ geometric algebra [9]. Such use of

quaternionic, Cliﬀord or Grassmann variables (see below) often extends, or streamlines, the

presentation of classical results.

However, it seems unlikely that number ﬁelds are necessary to transform the Kepler

problem into the oscillator.

If that were the case, we would expect regularization to be

possible only using real, complex, quaternionic or octonionic variables and therefore only to

occur in dimensions less than or equal to eight. But since both the Kepler problem and the

isotropic oscillator are inherently two dimensional, the Levi-Civita solution should suﬃce in

any higher dimension as well. Our generalized solution below demonstrates this to be the

case.

Now we choose polar coordinates in the plane of motion, and the problem reduces to

two dimensions. We next need to deal with the presence of angular momentum. With

The zeros of the denominator never occur for positive u, so the transformation f is regular

in the Kepler case. The regularity of the Kepler case is not typical – it is easy to see that

the solution for f may have many branches. The singular points of the transformation in

these cases should give information about the numbers of extrema of the orbits, the stability

of orbits, and other global properties. The present calculation may provide a useful tool

for studying these global properties in detail. The problem of global properties of orbits

remains open – power law forces have been examined [10], but more complicated potentials

allow arbitrarily many extrema. For example, the potential

increasing p. Such closed orbits will have arbitrarily many extrema.

Essential features of the regularizing transformation are evident even in the 1-dim case.

The Euler solution uses the substitutions

to turn the 1-dim Kepler equation of motion into the 1-dim harmonic oscillator. Before

moving to a proof for the general n-dim case, we note that more general transformations

are possible in the 1-dim case. Beginning with the equation of motion,

Notice that u is not necessarily a monotonic function of x so the transformation at zeros of

V ′ may be singular. We will not deal with such global issues here.

In higher dimensions the regularizing transformation is complicated by the presence of

angular momentum. Still, the general proof is similar, involving a change of both the radial

coordinate and the time. Once again, more general potentials can be treated. To begin, we

eliminate the angular momentum variables to reduce the problem to a single independent

variable. The only remaining diﬃculty is to handle the angular momentum term in the

radial equation.

We end the Section with some questions:

1. To what degree can regularizations be accomplished by canonical transformations?

What is the relationship between regularizations and canonical transformations?

2. What can be proved about extrema, boundedness and stability of orbits in monotonic

central potentials bounded by various power law potentials? in monotonic central

potentials? in arbitrary central potentials?

III.

INEQUIVALENT LAGRANGIANS AND HAMILTONIANS

One of the more startling inﬂuences of quantum physics on the study of classical me-

chanics is the realization that there exist inequivalent Lagrangians determining a given set

of classical paths. Inequivalent Lagrangians for a given problem are those whose diﬀerence

is not a total derivative. While it is not too surprising that a given set of paths provides

extremals for more than one functional, it is striking that some systems permit inﬁnitely

many Lagrangians for the same paths. There remain many open questions on this subject,

with most of the results holding in only one dimension.

The existence of classically inequivalent Hamiltonians is not so clear, since there are far

more transformations preserving Hamiltonian structure than there are preserving Lagrangian

structure. However, distinct Hamiltonians abound in quantum theory, where equivalent

Hamiltonians may lead to distinct quantum structures [11].

If there is more than one

Hamiltonian for a system, which one do we quantize? Furthermore, while it is clear that

distinct Hamiltonians can lead to diﬀerent quantum theories, what about the converse? Do
there exist distinct Hamiltonian operators, ˆH, ˆH ′ with identical expectation values for all

observables? Can distinct Hamiltonian operators have the same energy spectra?

Here, we restrict our attention to classical questions. To begin our exploration of inequiv-

alent Lagrangians, we describe classes of free particle Lagrangians and give some examples.

Next we move to the theorems for 1-dim systems due to Yan, Kobussen and Leubner ([12],

[13], [14], [15], [16]) including a simple example. Then we consider inequivalent Lagrangians

in higher dimensions. Finally, we brieﬂy examine the possibilities for inequivalent Hamilto-

nians.

A. General free particle Lagrangians

There are distinct classes of Lagrangian even for free particle motion. We derive the

classes and give an example of each, noting how Galilean invariance singles out the usual

choice of Lagrangian.

The most general velocity dependent free particle Lagrangian is

S =

f (v)dt

Z

11

We assume the Cartesian form of the Euclidean metric, so that v =

δijvivj. The equation

of motion is

p

d
dt

∂f
∂vi = 0

so the conjugate momentum

∂f
∂vi = f ′
is conserved. We need only solve this equation for the velocity. Separating the magnitude

pi =

vi
v

and direction, we have

vi
v

=

pi
p

v = g (p)

[f ′]−

≡

This solution is well-deﬁned on any region in which the mapping between velocity and

momentum is 1

−

1. This means that velocity ranges may be any of four types: v

∈
) . Which of the four types occurs depends on the singular-

(0,

) , (0, v1) , (v1, v2) , (v1,

∞

∞

ities of f ′vi/v. Since vi/v is a well-deﬁned unit vector for all nonzero vi, it is f ′ which

determines the range. Requiring the map from v i to pi to be single valued and ﬁnite, we

restrict to regions of f ′ which are monotonic. Independent physical ranges of velocity will

then be determined by each zero or pole of f ′. In general there will be n + 1 such ranges

v

∈

(0, v1), (v1, v2) , . . . , (vn,

)

∞

if there are n singular points of f ′. Of course it is possible that v1 = 0 (so that on the lowest

range, (0, v2) , zero velocity is forbidden), or v1 =

so that the full range of velocities is

∞

allowed. Within any of these regions, the Hamiltonian formulation is well-deﬁned and gives

the same equations of motion as the Lagrangian formulation.

Thus, the motion for general f may be described as follows. Picture the space of all

velocities divided into a number of spheres centered on the origin. The radii of these spheres

are given by the roots and poles of f ′. Between any pair of spheres, momentum and velocity

are in 1

1 correspondence and the motion is uniquely determined by the initial conditions.

−

In these regions the velocity remains constant and the resulting motion is in a straight line.

On spheres corresponding to zeros of f ′, the direction of motion is not determined by the

equation of motion. On spheres corresponding to poles of f ′, no solutions exist. It is amusing

to note that all three cases occur in practice. We now give an example of each.

12

First, consider the regular situation when f ′ is monotonic everywhere so the motion is

uniquely determined to be straight lines for all possible initial velocities. The condition

singles out the case of unconstrained Newtonian mechanics. this is the only case that is

Galilean invariant, since Galilean boosts require the full range of velocities, v

(0,

).

∞

∈

When f ′ has zeros, we have situations where a complete set of initial conditions is insuf-

ﬁcient to determine the motion. Such a situation occurs in Lovelock, or extended, gravity,

in which the action in d-dimensions (for d even) is of the general form

where Rab is the curvature 2-form, ea the solder form and the ak are arbitrary constants. This

is the most general curved spacetime gravity theory in which the ﬁeld equations depend on

no higher than second derivatives of the metric [17]. In general, the ﬁeld equations depend on

powers of the second derivatives of the metric, whereas in general relativity this dependence

is linear. Among the solutions are certain special cases called “geometrically free” [18].

These arise as follows. For some choices of the constants ak, we may rewrite S in the form

Suppose that for all k = 1, . . . , n for some n in the range 2 < n < d/2, we have

for some ﬁxed value α. Then the variational equations all contain at least n

1 factors of

−

Therefore, if there is a subspace of dimension m > d

n + 1 of constant curvature

for a, b = 1, . . . , m, then the ﬁeld equations are satisﬁed regardless of the metric on the

complementary subspace. This is similar to the case of vanishing f ′, where the equation of

motion is satisﬁed regardless of the direction of the velocity,

as long as v, but not vi, is constant.

Finally, suppose f ′ has a pole at some value v0. Then the momentum diverges and motion

never occurs at velocity v0. Of course, this is the case in special relativity, where the action

of a free particle may be written as

Once again, the constancy of the momentum is immediate. However, despite the apparent

diversity of Hamiltonians, they are locally related by canonical transformations. The only

distinctions are the global ones, and these exactly match those described above.

B.

Inequivalent Lagrangians

The existence of inequivalent Lagrangians for a given physical problem seems to trace

back to Lie [19]. Dirac ([20],[21]) was certainly well aware of the ambiguities involved in

passing between the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics. Later,

others ([22],[23],[24],[25]), identiﬁed certain non-canonical transformations which nonethe-

less preserve certain Hamiltonians. A speciﬁc non-canonical transformation of the 2-dim

harmonic oscillator is provided by Gelman and Saletan [26]. Bolza [27] showed that inde-

pendent Lagrangians can give the same equations of motion and, a few years later, Kobussen

[12], Yan ([13],[14]) and Okubo ([28],[29]) independently gave systematic developments show-

ing that an inﬁnite number of inequivalent Lagrangians exist for 2-dim mechanical systems.

Shortly thereafter, Leubner [16] generalized and streamlined Yan’s proof to include arbitrary

functions of two constants of motion.

Leubner’s result, the most general to date, may be stated as follows. Given any two

constants of motion, (α, β) , associated with the solution to a given 1-dim equation of motion,

the solution set for any Lagrangian of the form

arbitrary constants of the motion – each may be an arbitrary function of simpler constants

such as the Hamiltonian. We argue below that in 1-dim the solution sets are locally identical,

though [16] provides no explicit proof. In higher dimensions there are easy counterexamples.

We illustrate a special case of this formula, of the form

where K is any constant of the motion of the system. This expression is valid when the

Therefore, the Euler-Lagrange equation holds if and only if K (x, ˙x) is a constant of the

motion.

The uniqueness in 1-dim follows from the fact that a single constant of the motion is

suﬃcient to determine the solution curves up to the initial point. The uniqueness also

depends on there being only a single Euler-Lagrange equation. These observations lead us

to a higher dimensional result below.

It is interesting to notice that we can derive this form for L, but with K replaced by the

Hamiltonian, by inverting the usual expression,

for the Hamiltonian in terms of the Lagrangian. First, rewrite the right side as:

Now, dividing by ˙x and integrating (regarding H as a function of the velocity) we ﬁnd:

The remarkable fact is that the Hamiltonian may be replaced by any constant of the motion

in this expression. Conversely, suppose we begin with the Lagrangian in terms of an arbitrary

While it is possible to solve the cubic equation to ﬁnd ˙x (˜p) , and then substitute to ﬁnd
˜H (x, ˜p) as an explicit function of ˜p, it is clear that the resulting expression is not of the

same form as the original Hamiltonian. There remains the question of whether this eﬀect

could be achieved by a time-independent canonical transformation. The transformation of

and the resulting Hamiltonian equations of motion are not transparent.

(cid:18)

There does exist, of course, a time-dependent canonical transformation relating the two

Hamiltonians. The systems are nonetheless distinct globally, since the cubic relationship

between momentum and velocity limits the allowed ranges of the variables for the higher

order Hamiltonian. It would be interesting to know if there is a unique Hamiltonian for

which p (v) is 1

1. Are inequivalent Lagrangians equivalent?

Inequivalent Lagrangians have been deﬁned as Lagrangians which lead to the same equa-

tions of motion but diﬀer by more than a total derivative. For the simple case above, the

cubic order equation of motion factors into the energy times the usual equation of motion,

and setting either factor to zero gives the usual solution and only the usual solution. How-

ever, is this true in general? The Yan-Leubner proof shows that the new Lagrangian has

the same solutions, but how do we know that none of the higher order Lagrangians intro-

duces spurious solutions? The proofs do not address this question explicitly.

If some of

these Lagrangians introduce extra solutions, then they are not really describing the same

motions.

Suppose, for some time-independent Hamiltonian we write

v f [α (x, ξ)]
ξ2

dξ

L = v

Z

where α is any constant of the motion. Then we know that the Euler-Lagrange equation is

satisﬁed by the usual equation of motion. But what is the Euler-Lagrange equation? We

have shown that

dα (x, ˙x)

.

18

Setting this to zero, we have two types of solution

f ′ (α) = 0

dα
dt

= 0.

If spurious solutions could arise from motions with f ′ = 0, those motions would have to

stay at the critical point, α0 say, of f. But this means that α = α0 remains constant.

Therefore, the only way to introduce spurious solutions is if dα/dt = 0 has solutions beyond

the usual solutions. This may not be possible in one dimension. Finally, the inverse of the

equation α (x, t) = α0 may not exist at critical points, so the theorem must refer only to

local equivalence of the solutions for inequivalent Lagrangians.

C.

Inequivalent Lagrangians in higher dimensions

It is of interest to extend the results on inequivalent systems to higher dimension. Pre-

sumably, the theorems generalize in some way, but while one dimensional problems may be

preferable “for simplicity” [16], this restricted case has many special properties that may

not generalize. In any case, the method of proof of the Kobussen-Yan-Leubner theorem does

not immediately generalize.

For 1-dim classical mechanics, there are only two independent constants of motion. The

Kobussen-Yan-Leubner theorem, eq.(3), makes use of one or both to characterize the La-

grangian and, as noted above, one constant can completely determine the paths motion in

1-dim. The remaining constant is required only to specify the initial point of the motion.

This leads to a simple conjecture for higher dimensions, namely, that the paths are in general

determined by n of the 2n constants of motion. This is because n of the constants specify

the initial position, while the remaining constants determine the paths.

We make these comments concrete with two examples. First, consider again the free

particle in n-dim. The usual Hamiltonian is

H =

p2
2m

and we immediately ﬁnd that a complete solution is characterized by the initial components

of the momentum, p0i and the initial position, x0i. Clearly, knowledge of the momenta is

necessary and suﬃcient to determine a set of ﬂows. If we consider inequivalent Lagrangians

19

where

then the momenta

vx =

m

comprise a set of ﬁrst integrals of the motion. Inverting for the velocity

ﬁxes the ﬂow without ﬁxing the initial point.

In general we will need at least this same set of relations, vi = vi (pi0) , to determine the

ﬂow, though the generic case will involve n relations depending on 2n constants:

(cid:0)
Notice that fewer relations does not determine the ﬂow even for free motion in two dimen-

(cid:1)

sions. Thus, knowing only

leaves the motion in the y direction fully arbitrary.

In an arbitrary number of dimensions, we ﬁnd that expression for the energy in terms

of the Lagrangian is still integrable as in the 1-dim case above, as long as v = √v2. If the

Lagrangian does not depend explicitly on time, then energy is conserved. Then, letting
ˆθi = ˙xi/v, we can still write the Lagrangian as an integral over Hamiltonian:

L

dξ + f

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

where f

x, ~θv

is now necessary in order for L to satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equations.

The integral term of this expression satisﬁes one of the Euler-Lagrange equations. If we

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

now deﬁne a new Lagrangian by replacing H by an arbitrary, time-independent constant of

the motion, α

We conjecture that for a suitable choice of f, ˜L provides an inequivalent Lagrangian, thereby

providing one of the n relations required to specify the ﬂow.

D.

Inequivalent Hamiltonians

The question of inequivalent Hamiltonians is quite distinct from that of inequivalent La-

grangians, because the group of allowed transformations is much larger. Indeed, Hamilton-

Jacobi theory shows that any Hamiltonian may be made trivial by a canonical transforma-

tion. This also means that any two Hamiltonians are related locally by a time-dependent

canonical transformation. At least in this sense, all Hamiltonians with the same number of

degrees of freeedom are locally equivalent.

In light of this, the ﬁrst question to be answered is the following. Since the properties

of canonical transformations are deﬁned by the demand that they change the action by

no more than a total derivative (for example, in the derivation of the properties of gener-

ating functions), how can two Hamiltonians be locally equivalent while the corresponding

Lagrangians are inequivalent? The answer is subtle. Canonical transformations are deﬁned

in such a way as to leave the Hilbert one-form

L

pi, ˙xi, qi, t

dt = pi

H

changed by no more than an exact form. But this L is not quite the Lagrangian, since

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

L = L

pi, ˙xi, qi, t

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

while a true Lagrangian is a function of xi and ˙xi only. Since the Lagrangian formalism is

invariant only under coordinate diﬀeomorphisms, xi = xi (qj, t) , canonical transformations

involving both pi and xi are not expected to preserve it.

Despite Hamilton-Jacobi theory, there are ways to deﬁne a notion of inequivalent Hamil-

tonians. First, if we restrict to time-independent canonical transformations, there exist

distinct Hamiltonian systems related by diﬀeomorphisms, H (q, π) = H[x (q, π) , p (q, π)].

This allows substantial variation in the functional form of the Hamiltonian and it may be

21

diﬃcult to determine whether two Hamiltonians are related in this way. Second, we may

deﬁne canonoid transformations, deﬁned as preserving the canonical structure for one or

more Hamilton [26]. Presumably, these are related to symmetries of particular systems. Or,

third, we may quantize the system and ask whether the quantum systems are equivalent.

These considerations point to a heirarchy of classiﬁcations of Hamiltonian systems, equiv-

alent up to some set of transformations. It would be useful to know the exact set of trans-

formations under which a given set of phase space paths is invariant. We know that the set

is smaller than time-dependent transformations and larger than canonical transformations,

and seems likely that the answer depends on the class of curves in some way. Since it is

really the solution curves that deﬁne equivalence, it is clear that some systems will have

more symmetry than others.

Even if we had a clear characterization of Hamiltonians for a given system, it is not clear

that we know what the system is. For example, suppose a given system admits a time-

independent canonical tranformation taking the Hamiltonian to a constant. Such a system

exists if we can ﬁnd nontrivial solutions to the time-independent Hamilton-Jacobi equation

m
2

·

~▽S

~▽S + V = 0

and this is surely possible for some systems. But this means that one of the equivalent

formulations of the problem describes straight-line motion. Clearly, ﬁnding the solution

curves is not enough to describe such a system – we must also keep track of the sequence

of transformations we used to trivialize that solution. Thus, specifying a classical system

requires some statement about the correspondence between phase space coordinates and

measurements in some physical system. Of course, there are many equivalent ways to set up

such a correspondence, but at least one must be speciﬁed and the subsequent transformations

tracked.

IV. CONSTANTS OF MOTION

Recent decades have seen interesting new techniques and revivals of known results for

symmetries ([32],[33]). Some of these have to do with the Kepler problem. The best-known

rediscovery concerning the Kepler problem is that in addition to the energy, E and angular

the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector ([34], [35], [36], [37]) is conserved. We deﬁne the Laplace-

Runge-Lenz vector by

Geometrically, A points in the direction of the periapsis, and may therefore be thought of

as giving specifying the orientation of the orbit within the orbital plane. Keplerian orbits

can be described completely in terms of six initial conditions, and since one of these is the

initial position on a given ellipse, only ﬁve remain among the energy, angular momentum

and Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector [38]. Two constraints – the orthogonality of A and L, and a

relationship between the magnitudes A, L and E – give the correct count. Of course, these

three quantities are not the only set of constants we can choose. A number of fairly recent

authors ([2],[39],[40],[41]) have identiﬁed a simpler conserved vector quantity, which (lacking

evidence for an earlier reference) we will call the Hamilton vector [42]. It is given by

u = v

α
L

ˆϕ

−

and may be used together with the energy and angular momentum as a complete set of

constants. Apparently this vector was well-known in the 19th century, then dropped from

texts [2]. Its time constancy is a direct consequence of the force law since, for an arbitrary

central force f (r),

and dui/dt = 0 precisely when f (r) is given by an inverse square law . Notice that it is the

balance between the radial dependences of angular momentum and the force that allow this

characterization. We give a derivation of the Hamilton vector below.

It might be of interest to study more general central force problems using time-dependent

versions of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz and Hamiltonian vectors. While no longer conserved,

they are more geometrical than the usual polar coordinates. This could result in some

simpliﬁcation. It would also be of interest to know if these vectors correspond to symmetries

– perhaps they reﬂect symmetries of the corresponding phase space, or, since the bound state

Kepler problem may be embedded with an SO(4) symmetry, perhaps they are part of that

symmetry. It seems likely that the Kepler problem has an even larger symmetry – perhaps

SO(4, 1) – since the open orbits have SO(3, 1) symmetry. This might be explored by writing

the Kepler problem in terms of Spin (4, 1) conformal spinors.

Mu˜noz [2] shows that the Hamiltion vector leads to an easy derivation of the equation of

motion. Indeed, let the perihelion of the orbit occur at time t = 0 on the x-axis so that the

course, allowed within even the Newtonian formulation. A simple electronic circuit and

feedback mechanism can easily drive a motor in a way dependent upon rates of change of

the acceleration. Moreover, there are systems of genuine physical and mathematical interest

which require higher order diﬀerential equations for their description. After deriving a few

general results for higher order systems, we look at one example in detail – Bohmian quantum

mechanics.

Naturally, higher order equations require more initial data than we usually have to specify

to determine the motion of a classical system, so their occurrence is somewhat rare. But

ultimately, any restriction to second order equations in classical physics is phenomenological,

depending principally on the success of second order models for ﬁtting measurements. If

we take quantum physics into account, higher order equations in ﬁeld theory may introduce

ghosts or other undesirable features.

Nonetheless, there are situations where higher order equations are justiﬁed. We brieﬂy

discuss one of these below, Bohmian quantum mechanics. The KdV equation provides an

example of an integrable system, having an inﬁnity of independent constants of motion. It

is presented in an Appendix, as is the approach to chaos.

B. Bohmian quantum mechanics

A central theme of the Bohmian approach to quantum mechanics is to give it a form

which may be interpreted classically ([44],[45],[46]). The ﬁrst step is to replace the complex

wave function by pair of real valued functions. This is accomplished as follows. Let

isotropic oscillator can lead to parametric resonance [49]. It would be of interest to ﬁnd the

relationship of such parametric resonances to the eigenmodes of the corresponding quantum

problem.

VI. GAUGING NEWTON’S LAW

One surprising new result in classical mechanics is that both the Lagrangian and Hamil-

tonian formulations of Newton’s laws may be derived as gauge theories of Newton’s second

law ([55],[56]). To see how this comes about, and to understand the symmetries involved,

we digress a moment to consider the essential elements of a physical theory. In particular,

we want to distinguish two features: dynamical laws and measurement theory.

The distinction between these is easy to see. For example, in quantum mechanics the

dynamical law is the Schr¨odinger equation

which governs the time evolution of the wave function, ψ. The measurement theory is what

establishes the correspondence between calculations and measurable numbers. One of the

chief elements of quantum measurement theory is therefore the Hermitian inner product on

Hilbert space:

ˆHψ

i~ ∂ψ
∂t

ψ∗ψd3x.

As a second example, consider Newtonian mechanics. The dynamical variable for a particle

is the position vector, x, and its motion is governed by the second law:

34

while the inner product allows us to extract measurable magnitudes

F = m

d2x

i

·

We are intested in the diﬀerences in the symmetries of dynamical laws and measurement.

Generally, the diﬀerential or other equation governing dynamical evolution is invariant under

some global symmetry. In contrast to this, a metric, an invariant product or some other real-

valued mapping to measurable quantities is often invariant under a group of diﬀeomorphisms.

Whatever the symmetries, it often occurs that the symmetry of dynamical evolution and the

symmetry of the measurement theory are diﬀerent. Which is the symmetry of the system?

For Newtonian measurements, the inner products allow local transformations and there-

fore have the larger symmetry. It makes sense to try to extend the symmetry of the dy-

namical law to agree with that of the measurement theory. Fortunately, there are standard

techniques for accomplishing this extension – the methods of gauge theory.

Gauging takes a global symmetry, that is, a symmetry that is independent of position and

time, and extends it to a local symmetry, i.e., one that may be diﬀerent at diﬀerent positions.

We systematically extend to a local symmetry by introducing a connection: a one-form ﬁeld

valued in the Lie algebra of the symmetry we wish to gauge. Added to the usual partial

derivative, the connection subtracts back out the extra terms arising from diﬀerentiating

the local symmetry. The most familiar example is general relativity, in which the Christoﬀel

connection, Γα

µν added to partial derivative makes the derivative covariant with respect to

general coordinate transformations. The U(1) gauge theory of electromagnetism is also

familiar. In this case, the vector potential provides the connection.

What are the symmetries of the Newtonian dynamical and measurement theories? There

is more than one answer. The dynamical law is invariant under the Galilean group, G,

consisting of rotations, translations, Galilean boosts and time translations. It is possible

to extend the rotations to general linear transformations and still leave the second law

invariant. For the measurement theory, the Euclidean line element is invariant under the set

of 3-dimensional rotations and translations, ISO(3). This is called the Euclidean group. If

35

we regard Euclidean 3-space as a manifold instead of a vector space, these transformations

may be local. Furthermore, recognizing that we only actually measure dimensionless ratios

(for example, the ratio of the height of a tree to the length of a meter stick), we can require

invariance of ratios of line elements. This gives the conformal group, SO(4, 1).

We will consider two of the possible gaugings of Newton’s second law – Euclidean and

conformal.

A. Euclidean gauge theory of Newton’s second law

The Euclidean gauging of Newton’s second law leads to Lagrangian mechanics. This

is not a particularly surprising result. However, while it is well-known that Lagrangian

mechanics provides a form of Newton’s second law valid for “generalized coordinates,” the

construction by gauging has advantages: (1) it arrives at the Lagrangian formulation in a

systematic way, (2) gauging displays explicitly the meaning of generalized coordinates, and

(3) it illustrates the general techniques used for the gauging of conformal symmetry below.

As we shall see, the results of conformal gauging in the next subsection are unexpected.

Proceeding, ﬁrst recall that the transformations of the Euclidean group ISO(3) include

three rotations and three translations, and the Lie algeba has corresponding generators.

Gauging therefore gives us two sets of 1-form gauge ﬁelds:

1. Three translational gauge ﬁelds, comprising the dreibein, ei.

2. Three rotational gauge ﬁelds, the SO(3) spin connection, ωi

j, antisymmetric under the

interchange of indices.

The gauging proceeds just as when we gauge the Poincar´e group to develop Riemannian

geometry ([57],[58]). In Poincar´e gauging, the vierbein, ea, is identiﬁed with an orthonormal

frame ﬁeld on a 4-dim Riemannian manifold and the spin connection ωa

b permits the use of
local Lorentz transformations. For the present Euclidean case, the dreibein, ei, is identiﬁed

with an orthonormal basis of a 3-dim manifold and the SO(3) spin connection, ωi

j, gives local

rotational symmetry. The pair

is equivalent to the metric and general coordinate

connection, (gmn, Γm

rs) .

ei, ωi
j

The solution of these is simple since we do not include curvature. The ﬁrst equation is solved

by the pure gauge form of the connection,

where Λi

j (x) is a local rotation matrix. This means that there exists a choice of frames (say,
j = constant) in which the spin connection is zero. Choosing this frame, the equation for

Λi

the dreibein is satisﬁed by setting

ei = dxi

From this we see that the equations describe Euclidean 3-space. Using the spin connection

we can deﬁne a derivative operator which is covariant with respect to local rotations. If

we cast the same equations in terms of a coordinate basis using the metric and Christoﬀel

connection, (gmn, Γm

rs) , the derivative is covariant with respect to general coordinate changes,

We may ﬁnd the new dynamical law using a variational principle. Using the coordinate

or diﬀeomorphisms.

metric,

we choose the squared norm of the velocity vector, plus a function of the coordinates to

provide a source for the motion:

gmn = e i

m e j

n δij

S =

[gmnvmvn + φ (xm)]dt

Z

Because we have local symmetry, we can write the same thing in any coordinates. Notice

that there is always some arbitrariness in the gauging procedure at this point. There are

two properties we demand of this variational principle. First, it must be invariant under

the local symmetry group. Second, we require the restriction of the new dynamical law

to the original symmetry to reproduce the original law. The action S above satisﬁes these

requirements.

37

Varying S, we ﬁnd the new form of Newton’s law,

gmn

Dvn
dt

=

∂φ
∂xm

xα = xα

0 + vα
0 t

where the covariant derivative of vm transforms as a vector under local rotations. When

φ = 0, this is the geodesic equation. Since the space is Euclidean, the geodesics are straight

lines. The class of straight lines

is equivalent to the class of Newtonian inertial reference frames.

Writing V =

m
2 ϕ for a potential V, we see that forces produce deviations from geodesic
motion. This is the Lagrangian formulation of mechanics. Note that we get the same

−

equation of motion if we substitute the Lagrangian in the form

L = gmnvmvn + φ (xm)

into the usual Euler-Lagrange equation. The general coordinate invariance (“use of general-

ized coordinates”) is, of course, one of the main reasons for the use of Lagrangian methods.

The present approach, while principally intended to pave the way for the conformal gauging

below, does have the advantage of systematically showing that the class of generalized coor-

dinates is just the diﬀeomorphism group. In the usual formulation, this conclusion follows

from the coordinate invariance of the action.

B. Conformal gauge theory of Newton’s second law

We now repeat the gauging process, but this time use the full conformal symmetry. The

conformal group (for compactiﬁed 3-dim Euclidean space) contains ten transformations:

1. 3 rotations

2. 3 translations

3. 1 dilatation

4. 3 special conformal transformations

38

The ﬁrst two sets of transformations reproduce the Euclidean group. Dilatations just

rescale all lengths by a factor, while special conformal transformations are translations in

inverse coordinates.

These global transformations preserve the Euclidean line element up to an overall multi-

ple. As it stands, Newton’s second law is not invariant under even the global form of these

transformations – the special conformal transformations do not leave the law unchanged

because they do not act linearly on Euclidean 3-space. This is easy to ﬁx: we introduce

a very limited covariant derivative with a connection speciﬁc to global special conformal

transformations. It is unusual to require a connection in a dynamical law before gauging,

but nothing forbids it and it gives us an equation with the symmetry we wish to gauge.

Now consider Newton’s law, modiﬁed just enough to let us perform all 10 global conformal

transformations. Make those 10 global transformations local. There is more than one way

to do this, but so far only one appears to be interesting – the biconformal gauging described

below.

There will now be ten gauge ﬁelds:

1. The dreibein, ei

2. The (antisymmetric) SO(3) spin connection, ωi
j

3. The Weyl vector, W.

4. The co-dreibein, fi, from special conformal transformations

The local rotations, gauged by the spin connection, are as expected and we add local

dilatations gauged by the Weyl vector. These allow general coordinate invariance and scale

invariance. Employing the biconformal technique, we interpret (ei, fi) as an orthonormal

frame ﬁeld of a six dimensional space.

These gauge ﬁelds must satisfy the Maurer-Cartan structure equations:

dωi

j ωi
j = ωk
dei = ejωi

k + eifj −
j + Wei

ejf i

df i = ωj

i fj + fiW

dW = 2eifi

This is just the conformal Lie algebra in a dual basis. Once again the equations are easily

solved. The solution reveals a symplectic form,

39

θ = ekfk

dθ = 0

W =

yidxi

−

The six dimensional space therefore has a similar structure to a one particle phase space. The

units of the coordinates of this 6-dim space are not all the same. Three are correct for posti-

tion (xi, length) while the remaining three are geometric units for momentum (yi, 1/length).

Note that the conversion of units of momentum to units of inverse length may be accom-

plished using any conventional dimensional standards, e.g., meters, seconds and kilograms.

It also follows from the solution that the Weyl vector is given by

To ﬁnd the new dynamical law we again write an action. Since the geometry is like phase

space, the paths will not be anything like geodesics, so path length will not work. Instead,

we have a new feature – the Weyl vector – that comes from the dilatations. We will base

our dynamical law on the geometric interpretation of this vector ﬁeld. We digress brieﬂy to

explore its properties.

It follows from the nature of conformal geometry that the integral of the Weyl vector

along any path gives the relative physical size change along that path:

l = l0 exp

Wividt = l0 exp

W

Z

Z

This means that magnitudes are not preserved – initially identical rods transported along

diﬀerent curves might be diﬀerent sizes when they are returned together and compared.

This possibility is the price we pay for the freedom to make local scale transformations, just

as in a Riemannian geometry vectors may rotate even under “parallel” transport. We will

return to this point below.

We take the action to be the integral of the Weyl vector. Then the physical paths will be

paths of extremal size change. Notice that, while the exponential above is gauge dependent,

its variation is not. Indeed, it is worth noting that the gauge freedom of the Weyl vector

agrees exactly with the freedom to add a total derivative to a Lagrangian.

40

Once again we add a function to provide a source,

Now vary the action. There are six ﬁrst-order equations:

If we identify φ with the Hamiltonian, these are Hamilton’s equations. Therefore, the

gauge theory of Newton’s second law with respect to the conformal grouip is Hamiltonian

mechanics.

measured.

There are a couple of points to be clariﬁed. First, the multiparticle case works even though

a single Weyl vector must account for the Hamiltonian and momentum of each particle as

long as we assume that two particles never occupy exactly the same space. This is consistent

with the usual requirements of Newtonian mechanics, by which matter is impenetrable.

Second, the extremal value of the integral of the Weyl vector is zero. Thus, no measurable

size change occurs for classical motion, even though the Weyl vector does not have vanishing

curl. The classical paths are precisely the ones along which no physical dilatation is ever

It is also interesting to note that there is a 6-dim metric, of an unexpected form that is

consistent with collisions. It follows from the solution to the structure equations that the

line element is of the form

ds2 = dxidxi + dxidyi

Therefore, if we assume that the distance ds between two particles must vanish (or nearly

so) in order for two particles to collide, we see we must have dxi = 0, regardless of their

separation in momentum, dyi. This would not be the case if we had simply imposed a

Euclidean metric on the space.

These results provide a satisfying uniﬁcation of classical mechanics. In addition, the rel-

ativistic version of biconformal gauging also turns out to be interesting. We have shown

([59],[60]) that the method provides the best way to understand conformally invariant grav-

ity. The results are consistent with general relativity, and improve previous conformal gravity

41

theories. The fact that we can satisfactorily gauge classical mechanics – and get something

new – gives us a better understanding of, and more conﬁdence in, the relativistic theory.

There is also a suggestion of something deeper. Notice that quantum mechanics requires

both position and momentum variables to make sense, while biconformal gauging of New-

ton’s second law gives us a space which automatically has both sets of variables. Is it possible

that quantum physics takes on a particularly simple form in biconformal space? Anderson

and Wheeler claim it does, deriving a path integral formulation of quantum mechanics di-

rectly from a biconformal measurement theory [56]. It becomes possible to claim that the

physical manifold is really a six- (or, relativistically, an eight-) dimensional place, in which

quantum mechanics is a natural description of phenomena.

This interpretation of biconformal space works correctly. In particular, when we use the

covering group of the conformal group, the Weyl vector is necessarily complex. The presence

of an “i” in the Weyl vector makes an initially real, probabilistic evolution law into a unitary

evolution.

In addition, the requirement of the scale-invariant theory for taking ratios of

lengths to produce a meaningful measurement leads directly to the use of the product of

probability amplitudes in computing physically measurable probabilities. Naturally, the

proportionality between the inverse-length yi-coordinates and momenta is taken to be

Note that this factor drops out of Hamilton’s equations, making Planck’s constant classically

unmeasurable.

Thus, we have another way to think of quantum phenomena in a classical context. In

this formulation, however, we have the added advantage of a direct connection to general

relativity.

It becomes possible to ask questions about quantum measurement of curved

spacetimes in a classical context.

VII. SPIN, STATISTICS, AND PSEUDOMECHANICS IN CLASSICAL

~yi = pi

PHYSICS

A. Spin

Now that we have a gauge theory of mechanics, we can ask further about the represen-

tation of the gauge symmetry. A representation of a group is the vector space on which

42

the group acts. The largest class of objects on which our symmetry acts will be the class

determining the covering group. This achieves the fullest realization of our symmetry. For

example, while the Euclidean group ISO (3) leads us to the usual formulation of Lagrangian

mechanics, we can ask if we might not achieve something new by gauging the covering group,

ISpin(3) ∼= ISU (2) . This extension, which places spinors in the context of classical physics,
depends only on symmetry, and therefore is completely independent of quantization.

There are numerous advantages to the spinorial extension of classical physics. After

Cartan’s discovery of spinors as linear representations of orthogonal groups in 1913 ([61],[62])

and Dirac’s use of spinors in the Dirac equation ([63],[64]), the use of spinors for other areas of

relativistic physics was pioneered by Penrose ([65],[66]). Penrose developed spinor notation

for general relativity that is one of the most powerful tools of the ﬁeld. For example, the

use of spinors greatly simpliﬁes Petrov’s classiﬁcation of spacetimes (compare Petrov [67]

and Penrose [65],[68]), and tremendously shortens the proof of the positive mass theorem

(compare Schoen and Yau ([69],[70],[71]) and Witten [72]). Penrose also introduced the idea

and techniques of twistor spaces. While Dirac spinors are representations of the Lorentz

symmetry of Minkowski space, twistors are the spinors associated with larger conformal

symmetry of compactiﬁed Minkowski space. Their overlap with string theory as twistor

strings is an extremely active area of current research in quantum ﬁeld theory (see [73] and

references thereto). In nonrelativistic classical physics, the use of Cliﬀord algebras (which,

though they do not provide a spinor representation in themselves, underlie the deﬁnition of

the spin groups) has been advocated by Hestenes in the “geometric algebra” program [9].

It is straightforward to include spinors in a classical theory. We provide a simple example.

For the rotation subgroup of the Euclidean group, we can let the group act on complex 2-

vectors, χa, a = 1, 2. The resulting form of the group is SU(2). In this representation, an

ordinary 3-vector such as the position vector xi is written as a traceless Hermitian matrix,

X = xiσi

[X]ab = xi [σi]ab

L =

tr

˙X ˙X

V (X)

m

−

(cid:17)

(cid:16)

where σi are the Pauli matrices. It is easy to write the usual Lagrangian in terms of X :

where V is any scalar-valued function of X. However, we now have the additional complex

43

2-vectors, χa, available. Consider a Dirac-type kinetic term

and potential

λχa (i ˙χa

µχa)

−

V (χa) = λ ¯χaBiσiabχb + . . .

Notice there is no necessity to introduce fermions and the concomitant anticommutation

relations – we regard these spinors as commuting variables. A simple action therefore takes

the form

together with the complex conjugate of the second. The ﬁrst reproduces the usual equation

of motion for the position vector. Assuming a constant vector Bi, we can easily solve the

second. Setting χ = ψe−

iµt, ψ must satisfy

This describes steady rotation of the spinor,

σ, a vector such as X rotates as a matrix and therefore requires two factors of the

This illustrates the 2 : 1 ratio of rotation angle characteristic of spin 1/2. The new degrees of

freedom therefore describe classical spin and we see that spin is best thought of as a result of

the symmetries of classical physics, rather than as a necessarily quantum phenomenon. Sim-

ilar results using the covering group of the Lorentz group introduce Dirac spinors naturally

into relativity theory. Indeed, as noted above, 2-component spinor notation is a powerful

tool in general relativity, where it makes such results as the Petrov classiﬁcation or the

positivity of mass transparent.

B. Statistics and pseudomechanics

44

The use of spinors brings immediately to mind the exclusion principle and the spin-

statistics theorem. We stressed that spin and statistics are independent. Moreover, spin, as

described above, follows from the use of the covering group of any given orthogonal group

and is therefore classical. For statistics, on the other hand, the situation is not so simple.

In quantum mechanics, the diﬀerence between Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics is a

consequence of the combination of anticommuting variables with the use of discrete states.

In classical physics we do not have discrete states. However, nothing prevents us from

introducing anticommuting variables.

In its newest form, the resulting area of study is

called pesudomechanics.

product for diﬀerential forms

The use of anticommuting, or Grassmann variables in classical physics actually has an

even longer history than spin. The oldest and most ready example is the use of the wedge

This gives a grading of (

)p to all p-forms. Thus, if ω is a p-form and η a q-form,

−

∧ · · · ∧

ω

η = (

−

Then their (wedge) product is even or odd depending on whether pq is even or odd:

Nonetheless, p-forms rotate as covariant, rank-p tensors under SO(3) (or SO (n)), in viola-

tion of the familiar spin-statistics theorem. Under SU(2) they rotate as covariant, rank-2p

tensors, not as spinors.

Another appearance of anticommuting variables in classical mechanics stems from the

insights of supersymmetric ﬁeld theory. Before supersymmetry, continuous symmetries in

classical systems were characterized by Lie algebras, with each element of the Lie algebra

generating a symmetry transformation. The Lie algebra is a vector space characterized by

a closed commutator product and the Jacobi identity. Supersymmetries are extensions of

the normal Lie symmetries of physical systems to include symmetry generators (Grassmann

variables) that anticommute. Like the grading of diﬀerential forms, all transformations of

45

the graded Lie algebra are assigned a grading, 0 or 1, that determines whether a commutator

or commutator is appropriate, according to

[Tp, Tq]

)pq TqTp

where p, q

. Thus, two transformations which both have grading 1 have anticommu-

∈ {

}

tation relations with one another, while all other combinations satisfy commutation relations.

Again, there is nothing intrinsically “quantum” about such generalized symmetries, so we

can consider classical supersymmetric ﬁeld theories and even supersymmetrized classical me-

chanics. Since anticommuting ﬁelds correspond to fermions in quantum mechanics, we may

continue to call variables fermionic when used classically, even though their statistical prop-

erties may not be Fermi-Dirac. Perhaps more importantly, we arrive at a class of classical

action functionals whose quantization leads directly to Pauli or Dirac spinor equations.

Casalbuoni pioneered the development of pseudomechanics, showing that it was possible

to formuate an ~

→

0 limit of a quantum system in such a way that the spinors remain

but their magnitude is no longer quantized ([74], [75], see also Freund [76]). Conversely, the

resulting classical action leads to the Pauli-Schr¨odinger equation when quantized. Similarly,

Berezin and Marinov [77], and Brink, Deser, Zumino, di Vecchia and Howe [78] introduced

four anticommuting variables, θα to write the pre-Dirac action. We display these actions

below, after giving a simpliﬁed example. Since these approaches moved from quantum ﬁelds

to classical equations, they already involved spinor representations. However, vector versions

(having anticommuting variables without spinors) are possible as well. Our example below

is of the latter type. Our development is a slight modiﬁcation of that given by Freund [76].

To construct a simple pseudomechanical model, we introduce a superspace formulation,

extending the usual “bosonic” 3-space coordinates xi by three additional anticommuting

coordinates, θa,

Consider the motion of a particle described by [xi (t) , θa (t)], and the action functional

Since the coeﬃcients remain functions of xi, we have introduced four new ﬁelds into the

One of the goals of early explorations of pseudomechanics was to ask what classical

equations lead to the Pauli and Dirac equations when quantized. Casalbuoni ([74],[75]), see
also [76] showed how to introduce classical, anticommuting spinors using an ~

leads to the Pauli-Schr¨odinger equation when quantized. Similarly, Berezin and Marinov

[77], Brink, Deser, Zumino, and di Vecchia and Howe [78],introduced four anticommuting

and α is a Lagrange multiplier. The action, SDirac, is both reparameterization invariant

and Lorentz invariant. Its variation leads to the usual relativistic mass-energy-momentum

relation together with a constraint. When the system is quantized, imposing the constraint

on the physical states gives the Dirac equation.

Evidently, the quantization of these actions is also taken to include the entension to the

relevant covering group.

C. Spin-statistics theorem

48

Despite the evident classical independence of spin and statistics, there exists a limited

spin-statistics theorem due to Morgan [79]. The theorem is proved from Poincar´e invariance,

using extensive transcription of quantum methods into the language of Poisson brackets –

an interesting accomplishment in itself. A brief statement of the theorem is the following:

Theorem: Let L be a pseudoclassical, Poincar´e-invariant Lagrangian, built quadratically

from the dynamical variables. If L is invariant under the combined action of charge conju-

gation (C) and time reversal (T) then integer spin variables are even Grassmann quantities

while odd-half-integer spin variables are odd Grassmann quantities.

Proof relies on extending the quantum notions of charge conjugation and time reversal.

As in quantum mechanics, charge conjugation is required to include complex conjugation.

For fermionic variables, Morgan requires reversal of the order of Grassmann variables under

conjugation

(ηξ)∗ = ξ∗η∗

This insures the reality property (ηξ∗)∗ = ηξ∗, but this is not a necessary condition for

complex Grassmann numbers. For example, the conjugate of the complex 2-form

is clearly just

and is therefore pure imaginary. We must therefore regard the T C symmetry required by

the proof as somewhat arbitrary.

Similarly, for time reversal, [79] requires both

dz

∧

dz∗

→ −
τ
→ −

Whether this is an allowed Poincar´e transformation depends on the precise deﬁnition of

the symmetry. If we deﬁne Poincar´e transformations as those preserving the inﬁnitesimal

line element, dτ, then reversing proper time is not allowed. Of course, we could deﬁne

Poincar´e transformations as preserving the quadratic form, dτ 2 = gαβdxαdxβ, in which case

the transformation is allowed.

49

Despite its shortcomings, the proof is interesting because it identiﬁes a set of conditions

under which a classical pseudomechanics action obeys the spin statistics theorem. This is

an interesting class of theories and it would be worth investigating further. Surely there is

some set of properties which can be associated with the classical version of the theorem.

Perhaps a fruitful approach would be to assume the theorem and derive the maximal class

of actions satisfying it.

There are other questions we might ask of spinorial and graded classical mechanics. A

primary question is whether there are any actual physical systems which are well modeled

by either spinors or graded variables. If such systems exist, are any of them supersymmet-

ric? What symmetries are associated with spinorial and fermionic variables? Is there a

generalization of the Noether theorem to these variables? What are the resulting conserved

quantities? What is the supersymmetric extension of familiar problems such as the Kepler

or harmonic oscillator?

The statistical behavior of fermionic classical systems is not clear. Quantum mechani-

cally, of course, Fermi-Dirac statistics follow from the limitation of discrete states to single

occupancy. This, in turn, follows from the action of an anticommuting raising operator on

the vacuum:

=

a†a† = 0

Since classical states are not discrete, there may be no such limitation. Do anticommut-

ing classical variables therefore satisfy Bose-Einstein statistics? If so, how do Fermi-Dirac

quantum states become Bose-Einstein in the classical limit?

The introduction of pseudomechanics has led to substantial formal work on supermani-

folds and symplectic supermanifolds. See [80], [81] and references therein.

VIII. OBSERVATIONS

Clearly, the ﬁeld of classical mechanics has no conclusion, and we do not provide one

here. Within each topic we have tried to provide more questions than answers. However, in

the process of collecting these results, we have observed a few patterns. In closing, we take

note of those.

50

1. New elements in classical physics work their way into the ﬁeld from fundamental

research areas, notably quantum ﬁeld theory and general relativity. The former has

contributed spinors and anticommuting numbers while the latter lends the tools of

diﬀerential geometry to the study of symplectic manifolds.

2. Many of the new insights have been seen only in one or two dimensions. In these cases,

it remains an open question whether the properties even exist in higher dimensions,

which higher dimensions, and why in those dimensions. This applies particularly to

the study of inequivalent Lagrangians and Bohmian quantum mechanics.

3. Comparatively little use is made of the classical physics ArXiv. Researchers in the

area would beneﬁt by using this ready reference tool.

4. Classical mechanics is now strongly inﬂuenced by quantum mechanics. In addition to

Bohmian quantum mechanics, which seeks to realize quantum physics as some sort of

classical system, there is phase space quantization, which accomplishes much the same

thing in a diﬀerent way. An additional approach is suggested by the gauge theories

of Section 6. These programs demonstrate broad overlap between the classical and

quantum worlds.

APPENDIX B: ARBITRARY NUMBER OF EXTREMA IN KEPLER ORBITS

The problem of global properties of orbits remains open – power law forces have been

studied [10] and found to have limited numbers of extrema, but non-monotonic force laws

allow arbitrarily many extrema. We provide a simple example here.

APPENDIX C: THE KORTEWEG-DE VRIES EQUATION

While we have so far stayed within particle mechanics, many classical ﬁeld theories also

have interesting properties. Of particular interest are the “integrable systems” such as the

KdV and the sine-Gordon equations. These diﬀerential equations turn out to have inﬁnitely

many constants of motion.

The KdV equation is a one dimensional, third order ﬁeld equation that provides a good

example of hidden symmetries. Here we brieﬂy examine some of its properties. The inter-

esting history of the equation stretches over more than a century [50]. We will begin with a

modern form of the equation,

Consider any function of the form u = f (z) = f (x

vt) . Substituting, we ﬁnd that f must

satisfy

Let g = f + c, this becomes

ut =

These solutions for u propagate with unchanging shape f and constant velocity v. It can

be shown that pairs of solitary waves can pass through one another and emerge unchanged.

It has been suggested that the inﬁnite hierarchy of constants of the motion of this system

is related to the existence of such soliton solutions. Showing how these constants arise will

simultaneously illustrate some techniques of classical ﬁeld theory. Our treatment follows

that of Abraham and Marsden [50], which is recommended for further detail.

First, we show that the KdV equation may be described as a Hamiltonian system. For

particle motion expressed in canonical coordinates, we can deﬁne the Hamiltonian vector

ﬁeld, XH which is everywhere tangent to the phase space motion. Conversely, the classical

motion of the system is along the integral curves of this vector ﬁeld. Restricted to any

solution curve, XH is therefore given by

We therefore can characterize XH everywhere by writing

or more simply using diﬀerential forms,

for any vector ﬁeld, v.

a symplectic form as follows:

The same relationship holds in classical ﬁeld theory. For the KdV equation, we can deﬁne

(cid:18)
We therefore have a Hamiltonian system, and the KdV equation may be studied in terms

(cid:19)

Z

of a Hamiltonian ﬂow.

We now show that the KdV equation possesses inﬁnitely many constants of motion.

Deﬁne an inﬁnite set of Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds and Hamiltonian densities by acting re-

peatedly on X1 and f1 according to

The ﬁrst expression always exists, but the second is possible as long as each new Xn+1 is a

Hamiltonian ﬂow. In order for there to exist a Hamiltonian such that

we require the integrability condition

dH (v) = ω (XH , v)

d2H (v) = dω (XH, v)

0

≡

Essentially, this condition reduces to the equality of mixed partial functional derivatives.

We omit the inductive proof that shows that the condition is satisﬁed for all Xn, as long as
it holds for the initial set. Letting f1 = u2/2 it follows that

so f2 is the Hamiltonian density for the KdV equation,

Since the inductive hypothesis holds, the entire set of Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds Xn and

motion of the KdV equation. Consider the higher order “Hamiltonians” given by integrating

Now iterate this relationship. First suppose n and m are either both even or both odd.

where the last step follows by antisymmetry of the bracket. Now let m = n + 2k + 1. Again

But the last two lines are negatives of one another, and therefore vanish. Therefore, all of

the Hn have vanishing Poisson brackets with one another. In particular, since H2 is the

original Hamiltonian,

H2, Hm}

{

Hm constant. Since the evolution by H2 generates solutions to the KdV equation, all H n

are constants of integration of the KdV system.

The KdV equation has interesting quantum properties as well.

It can be shown that

the Schr¨odinger equation with time-dependent potential u (t) has solutions with a ﬁxed

energy spectrum – the time-dependence of the potential does not change the energies of the

soltutions. The proof hinges on the Lax theorem, which states that the KdV equation is

equivalent to the equation

where

and

ut = [L, A]

A = 4∂3

L = ∂2

utf =

4∂3

x + 6u∂x + 3ux, ∂2

x + u

f

= (uxxx + 6uux) f

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

This latter operator L is just the Schr¨odinger operator with potential u. The proof of the

theorem follows by direct calculation:

59

This is satisﬁed if

u satisﬁes the KdV equation. The full proof of the resulting isospectral

−

theorem may be found in [50]. In light of this relationship between a remarkable classical

system and its equally striking quantum properties, one wonders whether the relationship

between the classical and quantum mechanics may be much like the relationship between

the real line and the complex plane. Just as real functions often display their full character

only when analytically extended to the complex plane, many classical systems may show

their true natures when quantized. The KdV equation provides an excellent example of this

– solutions to the KdV equation, when used as quantum potentials, are isospectral despite

time-dependent potentials, and there may be a profound connection between the KdV and

Schr¨odinger systems.

The existence of equations such as the KdV equation, which have inﬁnitely many inde-

pendent conserved quantities is remarkable in several regards. For example, Goldstein, Poole

and Safko observe that the KdV equation provides a counterexample to the converse of the

Noether theorem [38]. Thus, while symmetries of an action lead to conserved quantities, the

KdV and other equations have inﬁnitely many conserved quantities without corresponding

symmetries.

There is little systematic theory of these so-called “integrable systems.” In fact, we lack

even a clear deﬁnition of this concept of integrability. Still, there has considerable recent

progress (see, for example, [51] and references therein).

A related question is whether such systems exist in higher dimensions. As with many

modern results in classical mechanics, examples are limited to one or two dimensions, and

it is unclear whether we are seeing properties of geometries or only of the real and complex

number systems.

APPENDIX D: CHAOS

While the study of nonlinear and chaotic systems is beyond the scope of this review, one

common example provides an interesting case of a higher order diﬀerential equation for a

classical system. The onset of chaos may be visualized by studying the ﬁxed points of the

logistic equation,

xk+1 = axk (1 + bxk)

60

for varying values of the parameters a and b (see the review articles by May [52], May and

Oster [53], as well as May [54] ) As the values of these parameters change, the number of

ﬁxed points passes through bifurcation points, leading to more and more frequent doubling

of the their number. At a ﬁnite value of the parameters, the number of ﬁxed points diverges

and the behavior of the system is said to become chaotic.

This equation may be converted into a nonlocal equation of continuous motion for a

one dimensional system. The ﬁxed points of the discrete equation then become periodic

solutions for the continuous system. Replace the discrete sequence xk with a function x (t) ,

which must satisfy

x (t + 1) = ax (t) [1 + bx (t)]

The left hand side may be expanded in a Taylor series as

x (t + 1) =

so at any time t, the function x must satisfy

This certainly qualiﬁes as a higher order diﬀerential equation!

We can ﬁnd the ﬁxed points from the continuous representation as well as from the

discrete one. At kth-order ﬁxed points of the discrete system, we require periodicity of the

form x (t + k) = x (t) . To examine the consequences of this condition, we employ a common

technique for periodic systems [49].

Suppose xi(t) are independent solutions to x (t + k) = x (t) . Then a general solution may

be written as a superposition of these, so xi (t + k) must be some superposition:

Periodic solutions then satisfy

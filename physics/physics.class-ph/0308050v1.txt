Optimal rotations of deformable bodies
and orbits in magnetic ﬁelds

Deformations can induce rotation with zero angular momentum where dissipation is a natural
“cost function”. This gives rise to an optimization problem of ﬁnding the most eﬀective rotation
with zero angular momentum. For certain plastic and viscous media in two dimensions the optimal
path is the orbit of a charged particle on a surface of constant negative curvature with magnetic
ﬁeld whose total ﬂux is half a quantum unit.

Rotations with zero angular momentum are intriguing.
The most celebrated phenomenon of this kind is the ro-
tation of a falling cat. A mechanical model [1] replacing
the cat by two rigid bodies that can rotate relative to
each other, has been extensively studied, see [2, 3] and
references therein. Here we address rotations with zero
angular momentum under linear deformations. Our mo-
tivation comes from nano-mechanics: Imagine an elastic
or plastic material with its own energy source, and ask
what is the most eﬃcient way of turning it through an
appropriate sequence of autonomous deformations with-
out external torque.

Deformations can generate rotations because order
matters: A cycle of deformations will, in general, result
in a rotation. The ratio between the rotation and the
(inﬁnitesimal) area of the controls can be interpreted as
curvature [4, 5]. Consequently, small cycles are ineﬀec-
tive since a cycle of length ε in the controls leads to a
rotation of order ε2. The search for optimal paths forces
one to mind deformations that are not small.

The problem we address has three parts. The ﬁrst
part is to determine the rotation for a given path of the
controls. We solve this problem for general linear de-
formations. In two dimensions this leads to curvature on
the space of the controls which is exponentially localized.
If one thinks of the curvature as a magnetic ﬁeld, then
the total magnetic ﬂux is that of half a unit of quantum
ﬂux. The second part is to set up a model for the cost
function. We choose the cost function to be a measure
of dissipation and focus on two settings, one where the
dissipation is rate independent, as is the case in certain
plastics, and the other where it is rate dependent as in
liquids. Both cost functions lead to the same metric on
the space of deformations. The third part is to pose and
solve the problem of ﬁnding the path of minimal dissi-
pation for a given rotation. In two dimensions and for
either model of dissipation, the problem maps to ﬁnd-
ing the shortest path that starts at a given point and
encloses a given amount magnetic ﬂux. Optimal paths
tend to linger near the circle in the space of controls
where the ratio of eigenvalues of the quadrupole moment

Deformations generate rotations because angular mo-
mentum is conserved [5]. Consider a collection of point
masses mα at positions xα. Internal forces may deform
the body, but there are no external forces. Suppose that
the center of mass of the body is at rest at the origin
and that the body has zero angular momentum. The to-
tal angular momentum, Lij, must then stay zero for all
times.

A linear deformation is represented by a matrix M

We now derive the fundamental relation between the
response (rotation) and the controls (deformations). To
this end we use the polar decomposition M = RS with R
a rotation and S a positive matrix. Assuming S positive
is a choice of a gauge which makes the representation

unique with S = √M tM . The symmetry of (dM )QM t

Eq. (3) determines the diﬀerential rotation,
, in terms of
the variation of the controls dS. The symbol -d stresses
that the diﬀerential will not, in general, integrate to a
function on the space of deformations. Geometrically,
the diﬀerential rotation is the connection 1-form which
ﬁxes a notion of parallel transport.

Eq. (3) can be interpreted in terms of a variational
principle: The motion is such that the kinetic energy is
minimal for a given deformation. To see this, let M = 1
and ˙M = ˙R + ˙S with ˙R antisymmetric (i.e. a rotation)
and ˙S symmetric (i.e. a strain). The kinetic energy is

drive rotations and we may restrict ourselves to volume
(or area) preserving deformations with det S = 1.

Since any Q is obtainable by a linear deformation of
the identity, we may assume without loss of generality
that Q = 1. Eq. (3) reduces to

FIG. 1: Positive, area preserving linear transformations may
be identiﬁed with the hyperboloid of revolution. The induced
metric obtained by embedding the hyperboloid in Minkowski
space gives it the structure of the Lobachevsky plane with
constant negative curvature.

The total curvature is easily computed from Eq. (11)
F = π. This, together with the positivity
and one ﬁnds
of f , implies that in any single closed cycle (i.e. one
without self intersections), the angle of rotation is at most
π. When interpreted as magnetic ﬂux, π corresponds to
half a unit of quantum ﬂux [7].

R

The cost function must include some measure of dissi-
pation. For, without dissipation energy is a function of
the controls and no change in energy is associated with
a closed loop. We consider two models of dissipation in
isotropic media. Both lead to the same metric on the
space of controls, namely

where u is the strain tensor and ˙u the strain rate. S is

strain is deﬁned as the change in the distance between
two neighboring points caused by a deformation. If the
deformation is described by a metric g then g = 1 + 2u,
where 1 is the metric associated with the undeformed ref-
erence system [6]. When considering linear deformation
described by a symmetric matrix S, the resulting metric

is g = S2 (regarding the covariant components of g as
the elements of a positive matrix). This establishes the
claimed connection between u and S.

quence of the L´evy-Mise constitutive relation: s δλ = δu,
where s is the stress and δλ a scalar valued function [8].
The constitutive relation is formally the same as for ﬂuids
[8], and by isotropy, the dissipation must be a function of
dℓ of Eq. (13). If the material is memoryless, dissipation
is additive with respect to concatenating paths and must
be proportional to dℓ.

This is the metric on the hyperboloid induced from
Minkowski space.
It gives the hyperboloid the geome-
try of the pseudo-sphere i.e. it makes it into a surface of
constant negative curvature

−
The metric enables us to assign a scalar to the curva-
ture 2-form F of Eq. (12) as the ratio between F and
the area form of the pseudo-sphere, sinh τ dτ
dθ. This
ratio is f (τ ) and is plotted in Fig. 2, along with a(τ )
which serves as the θ component of a vector potential for
f . The curvature is everywhere positive and it is con-
centrated near the origin, τ = 0. It decays exponentially
with τ . This means that large deformations are inef-
fective. We already know that small deformations are
ineﬀective. This bring us to the optimization problem.

∧

The control problem is to ﬁnd a closed path γ in the
space of deformations, starting at S0 = √Q0, (Q0 is the
initial quadrupole), which rotates the quadrupole by Φ
radians, with minimal dissipation. If the dissipation is
rate dependent, one adds a constraint that the time of
traversal is 1.

S0 = S(τ0, θ0). This is the (variation of the) action of
a classical particle with charge λ and unit mass moving
on the hyperbolic plane (i.e. the pseudo-sphere) in the
presence of a magnetic ﬁeld f (τ ) given in Eq. (12).

Since motion in a magnetic ﬁeld conserves kinetic en-
ergy the particle moves at constant speed and the dissipa-
tion, 1
2, depends only on the length of the path. The

variational problem can therefore be cast in purely geo-
metric terms: Find the shortest closed path starting at
a given point which encloses a given amount of magnetic
ﬂux. The shortest path is evidently also the solution in
the case that the dissipation is rate independent.

Consider the family of isospectral deformations τ =
const which keep the the eigenvalues of S (or Q) constant
while rotating its eigenvectors. We call these “stirring”,
see Fig. 3. One can not stir an isotropic body, since its
eigenvectors don’t have well deﬁned directions.

Among the stirring cycles there is an optimal one
which maximizes the rotation per unit length. From
Eqs. (11,17) the ﬂux to length ratio for stirring cycles
is a(τ ) of Eq. (11). The function a takes its maximum
1.061, see Fig. 2. Every cycle of

To make full use of the optimal stirring cycle the ini-
tial conditions must be right. This is the case for a
quadrupole with Q = S(2τs, θ), θ arbitrary. With other
initial conditions and for large angles of rotations, the
optimal paths approach the optimal stirring cycle, linger
near it, eventually returning to the initial point. This is
shown in Fig. 4 for a half turn of an isotropic body.

mum at τs. Therefore, closed orbits which correspond
to optimal paths have energy values E < a(τs)2/2. The
motion is quite simple: Trajectories leave the origin with
a positive ˙τ , reach the turning point τt = a−1(√2E), and
return symmetrically to the origin, thereby completing a
cycle. The ﬂux accumulated during a cycle is

where ˙θ is obtained from Eq. (19).

Increasingly longer orbits are obtained when E ap-
proaches the separatrix energy a(τs)2/2. The orbit cor-
responding to the unstable equilibrium point at τ = τs
is the optimal stirring cycle, which is a J = 0 orbit. The
ﬂux accumulated during a complete turn in parameter
space, where θ increases by 2π, is hence bounded by Φs.
Large values Φ require many turns during which the or-
bit approaches exponentially the optimal stirring cycle,
see Fig. 4. A circular disc of playdough would therefore
rotate by π, with no angular momentum, in about three
cycles.

[7] It is noteworthy that the total curvature of the hyper-
boloid is π and not an integer multiple of 2π as one would
expect from Gauss Bonnet Chern theorem. The reason is
the restriction to the hyperboloid with t > 0. If both signs
of t are taken, the two hyperboloids can be glued at inﬁnity
to give a sphere with total curvature 2π.

straint of enclosed ﬂux Φ, determine the three parameters
E, J and λ.

The initial condition τ (0) = 0 is special: By Eq. (19)
the angular momentum J is forced to have the value 0.
In turn, there is also one less condition to satisfy, as the
value of θ when τ = 0 is meaningless. It then follows from
Eqs. (19) and (20) that the optimal orbit, τ (θ), depends
only on the ratio E/λ2. Rescaling time properly, we can
achieve λ = 1 by relaxing the constraint that the time to
complete a cycle should be 1.

Magnetostatic Spin Waves

1 Problem

Magnetostatics can be deﬁned as the regime in which the magnetic ﬁelds B and H have
no time dependence, and “of course” the electric ﬁelds D and E have no time dependence
either. In this case, the divergence of the fourth Maxwell equation,

(in Gaussian units) implies that

H =

Jfree +

Jfree = 0,

(1)

(2)

i.e., that the free currents ﬂow in closed loops. Likewise, the time derivative of the fourth
Maxwell equation implies that Jfree has no time dependence in magnetostatics.

Often, magnetostatics is taken to be the situation in which

Jfree = 0 and D, E and
Jfree have no time dependence, without explicit assumption that B and H also have no time
dependence. Discuss the possibility of waves of B and H, consistent with the latter deﬁnition
of magnetostatics [1].

∇ ·

Consider two speciﬁc examples of “magnetostatic” waves in which Jfree = 0:

1. Ferromagnetic spin waves in a medium subject to zero external ﬁeld, but which has
a uniform static magnetization that is large compared to that of the wave. That is,
M = M0ˆz + mei(k·r−ωt), where m
M0. Here, the quantum mechanical exchange
interaction is the dominant self interaction of the wave, which leads to an eﬀective
2m, where α is a constant of the
magnetic ﬁeld in the sample given by Beﬀ = α
medium.

≪

∇

2. Waves in a ferrite cylinder in a uniform external magnetic ﬁeld parallel to its axis,
supposing the spatial variation of the wave is slight, so the exchange interaction may
be ignored. Again, the time-depedendent part of the magnetization is assumed small
compared to the static part. Show that the waves consist of transverse, magnetostatic
ﬁelds that rotate with a “resonant” angular velocity about the axis.

In practice, the spin waves are usually excited by an external rf ﬁeld, which is to be neglected
here.

2 Solution

2.1 General Remarks

In both deﬁnitions of magnetostatics the electric ﬁeld E has no time dependence, ∂E/∂t = 0,
so the magnetic ﬁeld B obeys ∂2B/∂t2 = 0, as follows on taking the time derivative of

Faraday’s law,

E =

(in Gaussian units). In principle, this is consistent with a magnetic ﬁeld that varies linearly
with time, B(r, t) = B0(r) + B1(r)t. However, this leads to arbitrarily large magnetic ﬁelds
at early and late times, and is excluded on physical grounds. Hence, any magnetic ﬁeld B
that coexists with only static electric ﬁelds is also static.

There remains the possibility of a “magnetostatic wave” in a magnetic medium that

involves the magnetic ﬁeld Hwave and magnetization density Mwave which are related by

0 = Bwave = Hwave + 4πMwave.

If there are no free currents in the medium, and any electric ﬁeld is static, then the fourth
Maxwell equation is simply

which deﬁnes a subset of magnetostatic phenomena.

H = 0,

2.2 Ferromagnetic Spin Waves

Consider a ferromagnetic material that consists of a single macroscopic domain with mag-
netization density M = M0ˆz + m(r, t), where M0 is constant and m
M0. We suppose
there are no external electromagnetic ﬁelds. Associated with the magnetization M are mag-
netic ﬁelds B and H whose values depend on the geometry of the sample. We suppose
that the weak time-dependent magnetic ﬁelds due to m lead to even weaker time-dependent
electric ﬁelds, such that the situation is essentially magnetostatic. The consistency of this
assumption will be conﬁrmed at the end of the analysis.

≪

The ferromagnetism is due to electron spins, whose dominant interaction is the quantum
mechanical exchange interaction, in the absence of external ﬁelds. For a weak perturbation m
of the magnetization, the exchange interaction preserves the magnitude of the magnetization,
so its time evolution has the form of a precession [2],

As this is the same form as the precession of a magnetic moment in an external magnetic
ﬁeld [3], the precession vector ~Ω is often written as a gyromagnetic factor Γ = e/2mec
107
Hz/gauss times an eﬀective magnetic ﬁeld Beﬀ (or Heﬀ). Here, e > 0 and me are the charge
and mass of the electron, and c is the speed of light. For a weak perturbation in an isotropic
medium [2],

electric ﬁelds are much smaller than the magnetic ﬁelds associated with the time-dependent
magnetization m, so that
H = 0 to a good approximation, and we may use the term
“magnetostatic” to describe the waves. These waves of magnetization are, however, better
termed “spin waves”, whose quanta are called “magnons”.

2.3 Rotating Magnetostatic Modes in a Ferrite Cylinder

In the magnetostatic approximation the ﬁelds B and H obey

B =

(H + 4πM) = 0,

∇ ·

∇ ·

H = 0,

(12)

where the ﬁeld B but not H and M must be static (or at least so slowly varying in time that
the resulting electric ﬁeld is small compared to B). We ﬁrst consider a ferrite of arbitrary
shape of characteristic length a in a uniform external magnetic ﬁeld Bext = Hext = H0ˆz. We
suppose that this ﬁeld is strong enough to induce a uniform magnetization M0ˆz throughout
the sample.

For waves with weak spatial dependence as we shall assume, the exchange interaction
is negligible, since it varies as the second spatial derivative of M. Then, the spins interact
primarily with the local magnetic ﬁeld B according to

We consider a perturbation m to the magnetization that has frequency ω and wavelength
large compared to the size of the the sample. Then the total magnetization can be written

but the corresponding perturbations b and h exist outside the sample as well.

solved with great virtuosity by Walker [6], following the realization that higher-order modes
deserved discussion [7]. Here, we content ourselves with the much simpler case of a long
cylinder whose axis is along the external ﬁeld, for which the lowest-order spatial mode was
ﬁrst discussed by Kittel [8]. We consider only the case of waves with no spatial dependence
along the axis of the cylinder.

With these restrictions, both eqs. (25) and (26) reduce to Laplace’s equation in two
dimensions. We can now work in a cylindrical coordinate system (r, θ, z), where appropriate
2-D solutions to Laplace’s equation have the form

br = hr + 4πmr = (1 + 4πα)hr

noting that for a cylinder the demagnetization factor is Nz = 0, so that Hz = H0, as is
readily deduced by elementary arguments. Since we consider frequency ω to be positive, we
see that the two solutions (31) correspond to two signs of H0, and are essentially identical.
For spheroidal samples, the modes are enumerated with two integer indices, and are not

all degenerate in frequency, as discussed in [6].

We close our discussion by showing that the electric ﬁeld of the wave is much smaller

than the magnetic ﬁeld. The scalar potential for mode n is

φn(r < a) =

φn(r > a) =

rn
an ei(nθ−ωt),

an
rn ei(nθ−ωt).

We see that for n > 0 the potential rotates with angular velocity Ωn = ω/n about the z axis.
The potential is maximal at r = a, so consistency with special relativity requires that

for high mode number the spatial variation of the wave becomes rapid, and the neglect of
the exchange interaction is no longer justiﬁed.

The monopole mode, n = 0, does not exist. The lowest mode is n = 1, which corresponds

We present a relativistic quantum calculation at ﬁrst order in perturbation theory of the diﬀer-
ential cross section for a Dirac particle scattered by the magnetic ﬁeld of a solenoid. The resulting
cross section is symmetric in the scattering angle as those obtained by Aharonov and Bohm (AB)
in the string limit and by Landau and Lifshitz (LL) for the non relativistic case. We show that
taking pr0 sin (θ/2)/¯h ≪ 1 in our expression of the diﬀerential cross section it reduces to that one
reported by AB, and if additionally we assume θ ≪ 1 our result becomes the one obtained by LL.
However, these limits are explicitly singular in ¯h as opposed to our initial result. We analyse the
singular behavior in ¯h and show that the perturbative Planck limit (¯h → 0) is consistent, contrarily
to those of the AB and LL expressions.

We know that in the classical scattering of charged particles by magnetic ﬁelds the particles describe circular
trajectories with ﬁxed radii, so they have a preferential movement direction. In this Letter, the relativistic quantum
version of the problem is studied in the lowest order of perturbation theory and a symmetric behavior in the scattering
angle is found for a solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld. We study some interesting limit cases of the diﬀerential cross section
and compare them with previous non relativistic results reported by Aharonov and Bohm (AB) [1] and Landau and
Lifshitz (LL) [2].

As it is known, the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect [1] is considered one of the most important conﬁrmed [3] predictions of
quantum mechanics because it shows that the vector potential has a physical signiﬁcance and can be viewed more
than a mathemathical convenience. The interest in this eﬀect has been increased recently [4]. Both because of basic
reasons that have changed the understanding of gauge ﬁleds and forces in nature and also because it has a lot of
connections with new physics, like the quantum Hall eﬀect [5], mesoscopic physics [6] and physics of anyons [7].

We want to point out that althought the present calculation seems to be elementary, indeed it is a calculation that
involves certain technical problems, as we will show. In this work, we will follow the Bjorken and Drell convention [8].
Let us consider the scattering of a Dirac particle by the magnetic ﬁeld of a solenoid with a constant magnetic ﬂux.
Note that this is a problem in which free particle asymptotic states can be used. Also notice that the global phase
exp (ieΦθ/hc) in the free particle wave function (because of the presence of a pure gauge ﬁeld in the exterior of the
solenoid) does not contribute to the S matrix.

Consider a long solenoid of lenght L and radius r0

L centered along the ˆı3 axis. Inside of the solenoid, where
r < r0, the magnetic ﬁeld is uniform, B = B0ˆı3, with B0 being a constant, while outside of the solenoid, where r > r0,
the magnetic ﬁeld is null. Replacing the vector potential that describes this magnetic ﬁeld in the lowest order in α of
the S matrix for Dirac particle solutions and multiplying by the phase space factors, we obtain the diﬀerential cross
section per unit length of the solenoid:

which has the same form whether or not the ﬁnal polarization of the beam is actually measured (f = 1 or f = 2), so
this result does not depend on the ﬁnal polarization. In Eq. (1), J1 are the ﬁrst order Bessel functions [9], θ is the
scattering angle, p stands for the momentum of the incident particle and Φ = πr2

0B0 is the total magnetic ﬂux.

As it can be observed, the diﬀerential cross section is symmetric in θ. This is reminiscent of the Stern-Gerlach
result, in which an unpolarized beam interacting with an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld is equally split into two parts,
each one with opposite spin. But, as we have mentioned before, Eq. (1) does not depend on the ﬁnal polarization of

the particles. Thus, this symmetric behavior of θ should be a consequence of the perturbation theory, althought this
symmetry is also present in non perturbative results [1,2].

We want to study the limit case of small scattering angles. So, if we assume pr0 sin (θ/2)/¯h

1, then the cross

Note that the cross section is singular when ¯h

Eq. (2) or in Eq. (3), because both expressions were obtained assuming the condition pr0 sin (θ/2)/¯h

we have to take the classical limit using the expression for the diﬀerential cross section given in Eq. (1). Deﬁning

and does not show any singularity in ¯h as compared to those of small scattering angles, Eq. (3), or small radii of
the solenoid, Eq. (2). Notice that the perturbative result gives a consistent ﬁnite classical limit and reduces to the
eikonal and the zero radius limits and it shows that taking the classical limit of such results is misleading. So, it is
worthwhile to notice that the order in which the limits are taken is crucial.

The apparent diﬀerence in the classical limits comes from the fact that in taking the limit ¯h

0 of the perturbative
1/√x and it does generate an ¯h contribution to the cross
result, Eq. (1), the Bessel function decreases as J1(x)
section. On the other hand, if one begins by taking the small angle or the small radius limit, the Bessel function
3
x, and this behaves like 1/¯h. The overall diﬀerence between these two procedures is an ¯h
approximates to J1(x)
factor. It is important to notice that loop corrections to the perturbative expansion do not modify the ¯h behavior of
the physical amplitude, as can be proved with the use of the loop expansion.

One can obtain a non divergent expression for the Landau and Lifshitz and the Aharonov and Bohm results when
0 if one quantizes Φ, the magnetic ﬂux. Imposing the magnetic ﬂux quantization condition, Φ = nΦ0, where

which apart of being independent of the charge of the particles, it is a cross section of a purely quantum eﬀect. Cast
in this way there is no singular behavior in ¯h, in contradistinction to the form that Landau and Lifshitz report. In
particular, for the case of small scattering angles, it takes the form

which also has a null classical limit.

Finally, we want to point out that althought our reslut is consistent in the sense that the Aharonov and Bohm and
the Landau and Lifshitz results are recovered, there is no direct classical correspondence via the Planck’s limit (see
Eq. (4)), because in particular the cross section is symmetric in θ. This problem is shared also by the AB and LL
solutions and is possibly solved by higher order corrections in the external magnetic ﬁeld.

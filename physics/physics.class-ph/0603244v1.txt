Abstract

We discuss the classical motion of a spring of arbitrary mass coupled to two arbitrary massive blocks attached
at its ends. A general approach to the problem is presented and some general results are obtained. Examples
for which a simple elastic function can be inferred are discussed and the normal modes and normal frequencies
obtained. An approximation procedure to the evaluation of the normel frequencies in the case of uniform elastic
function and mass density is also discussed.

Introduction

The motion of one or two masses linked by a massless spring constrained to move on a straight line and without
friction is analysed in several introductory and undergraduate mechanics textbooks, see for example [1], [2]. In
the case of two arbitrary masses, the two-body problem is solved by a reduction to the problem of a single body
oscillating with an angular frequency equal to
Ke/µ, where Ke is the spring constant and µ is the reduced mass
of the system, and the motion of the centre of mass of the system the velocity of which is constant if no external
forces are present. Moreover, since only the masses make contributions to the kinetic energy and to the total linear
momentum, the mechanical energy conservation theorem and the linear momentum conservation theorem can be
applied without much ado. The forces acting on the masses are due to the spring deformation at the extremities
where the masses are attached to. This is the reason why Newton’s third law of motion cannot be directly applied
to them. We are forced to consider in more detail the mechanism of interaction between the two masses and in
particular their interaction with the extremities of the spring to which each one of them is attached to. However,
due to the fact that the spring is massless we can state also that at any given moment of time the sum of those
forces is zero. Then, in an equivalent way, we can think that the masses move under the action of the force that
one mass exerts on the other, thereby complying with the third law in such a way that we can ignore the existence
of the spring.

p

The correction to the frequency for the case where one of end of the spring is kept ﬁxed and the mass m of the
spring, though not zero, is much less than the mass M attached to the oscillating end is well known. In this case in
order to get the angular frequency up to ﬁrst order we can consider the spring massless and replace the mass of the
oscillating body by an effective mass that is equal to M + m/3, see for example [1], see also [3] and references
therein.

In this paper we will consider a more general situation. We will consider the problem of two arbitrary masses,
say M1 and M2, attached to a spring of arbitrary mass m. The effects caused by the undulatory propagation of the
massive spring deformation along the spring length will be taken into account. Solutions to particular situations
such as the ones described above will be considered as appropriate limits of a less particular solution. We believe
that the approach we take here may be of some pedagogical value for advanced students and instructors as well.

2 The equations of motion for the massive spring and attached masses

We begin by establishing the equation of motion for the massive spring along a single spatial dimension. In order
to do so we introduce an auxiliary parameter x that will help us to describe the properties of the spring such as
for example its tension or its density at a given point. With this end in mind let us consider the spring in a non-
deformed condition and denote by ℓ its natural length. Now we deﬁne a one-to-one correspondence between the
spring viewed as a one-dimensional smooth matter distribution and the closed interval [0, ℓ] in such a way that
x = 0 corresponds to the left end of the spring and x = ℓ to its right end, see Figure 1. To an arbitrary point P on
the spring there corresponds a point x
[0, ℓ]. The parameter x must not be viewed as a regular spatial coordinate.
This parameter can be thought of if we wish as an internal degree of freedom of the spring and it is not subject
to the transformations associated with the one-dimensional Galileo group, for instance, non-relativistic boosts or
translations. Were the string made up of N discrete masses labeled by a discrete index j running from 1 to N , this
index would play a role analogous to x. We assume that the correspondence established here holds for any state
of motion of the spring, exactly as in the case of the discrete model. Now let it be an inertial reference frame
S
and a suitable coordinate system and let us suppose that the spring moves along the u-axis such that the position
of a point of the spring with respect to
is given by the function u (x, t), Figure 1. The tension T at a point of the
spring is given by [4]

where κ (x) is the elastic function of the spring which on physical grounds we suppose to be always positive, that
is κ(x) > 0 for any x
[0, ℓ]. In this way, at a given point the force that the right portion of the spring exerts on
the left portion wiil be T (x, t) and conversely the force that the left portion of the spring exerts on the right portion
will be
T (x, t). Consider now an element of the spring determined by x e x + dx. The resultant force acting on

this element is

If ρ (x) is the linear mass density of the spring then upon applying Newton’s second law of motion to the element
of mass ρ (x) dx we obtain

Figure 1: The motion of a point of the spring with respect to an inertial frame is described by the coordinate
u (x, t). Given a point P of the spring we associated with it the parameter x. This association is independent of
the dynamical state of the spring.

Notice that the equation of motion of the massive spring in the form given by equations (3) or (5) is invariant

under the galilean transformations. In fact, if we go from the inertial system

.

In this sense the galilean invariance of the equation of motion of the spring is manifest in accordance with the fact
that this equation derives from a straightforward application of the principles of newtonian mechanics.

Let us now consider the coupled masses. Let us model them by means of two point particles one of mass M1
coupled to the left end (x = 0) of the spring and the other of mass M2 coupled to the right end (x = ℓ). Making
use of equation (5) and Newton’s second and third laws we can write the equations of motion of the masses as

The complete solution of these equations and of equation (5) demands that we prescribe the initial conditions

where ϕ (x) := u (x, 0) and ψ (x) := ∂u (x, t = 0) /∂t describe the initial position and velocity of the points of
the spring.

Our aim is to obtain a general solution ξ (x, t) – or u (x, t) – to the problem and therefore describe an arbitrary

state of motion of the system i.e., the two blocks plus the massive string.

3 General solution of the equations of motion

We begin by solving equation (5) by the method of separation of variables, that is, we look for a solution of the
form

ξ (x, t) = X (x) T (t)

that satisfy also the boundary conditions given by equations (9) and (10). Taking equation (13) into (5) and
introducing the separation constant

λ we have

Equation (9) imposes a boundary condition on equation (15) to obtain it we take equation (13) into equation (9)
and write

In the same way, taking equation (13) into (10) and combining with equation (14) we obtain the condition

Let us show now that the eigenvalue λ cannot assume negative values. Suppose that we have an eigenfunction
X(x) corresponding to a particular eigenvalue λ. Consider the following identity which can be derived after an
integration by parts and use of equations (17), (18), and (15)

Since the left-hand side is always non-negative and the bracket on the right-hand side is always positive we con-
clude that λ is non-negative.

The null eigenvalue is physically acceptable and has a special meaning. The reason is that λ = 0 is common
to all springs regardless of their mass density, elastic function and the masses of the attached particles at their
extremities. Notice that the corresponding eigenfunction (the zero mode) can be obtained in a general form. This
particular mode is not associated with an oscilatory motion of the spring. In fact, for λ = 0 the temporal function
has the form

where α0 and β0 are constants. On the other hand, equation (15) for λ = 0 yields

where γ is an integration constant. Boundary conditions as expressed by equations (9) and (10), or equivalently
equations (17) and (18), demand γ = 0, so that X (x) = b = constant. The eigenfunction corresponding to this
eigenvalue is then

T (t) = α0t + β0,

dX(x)
dx

=

γ
κ (x)

ξ0 (x, t) = b (α0t + β0)

= x0 + V t

where we have introduced the new constants x0 and V . It is clear that this solution corresponds to a uniform
motion of the entire system (masses plus spring) with a common velocity V . The zero mode motion is related to
galilean boosts and may be added to any other solution of the problem if questions about galilean invariance are an
issue.

Finally, let us consider the case of positive λ. Setting λ = ω2 for convenience we write the solutions to equation

(14) as

where n is a positive integer, ωn is the n-th frequency eigenvalue indexed in crescent order (ω1 < ω2 < ω3 . . . )
and An and φn are constants. The n-th eigensolution to equation 5) corresponding to the n-th eigenfrequency is

These modes represent the oscillatory modes of the system. The general solution can be written as

Tn (t) = An cos (ωnt + φn)

ξn (x, t) = Xn (x) Tn (t)

ξ (x, t) = x0 + V t +

u (x, t) = x0 + x + V t +

Xn (x) Tn (t)

(26)

n=1
X

The next step is the explicit determination of the spectrum of eigenfrequencies ω. This is, however, a hard task
to perform and in principle it can be accomplished only if we also know explicitly the elastic function κ (x). As
mentioned before, the zero mode is the only mode that does not depend on the form of κ (x).

4 The orthogonality of the eigenfunctions

Before dealing with concrete examples let us consider a little bit more some of the formal aspects of our problem.
Equations (17) and (18) can be read as boundary conditions for equation (15) therefore only for certain values
of λ there will be solutions to this equation. The reader will recognise immediately that we are dealing with
a Sturm-Liouville system. Let us consider then two different eigenvalues, say λm and λn and their respective
eigenfunctions Xm (x) and Xn (x). These eigenfunctions satisfy the differential equations

+ λmρXm (x) = 0

κ (x)

+ λnρXn (x) = 0

(cid:21)
As usual we multiply the ﬁrst equation by Xn and the second by Xm, subtract one from the other and after simple
additional manipulations we end up with

Integrating this last equation over the domain [0, ℓ] and taking into account the boundary conditions given by
equations (17) and (18) we obtain after some simpliﬁcations

At this point we deﬁne a scalar product in the space of functions that will be convenient for our purposes. Let the
functions f (x) and g (x) be deﬁned in the closed interval [0, l], then by deﬁnition their scalar product is

f, g

ρ(x)f (x) g (x) dx + M2f (l) g (l) + M1f (0) g(0).

With this deﬁnition for the scalar product we can consider the eigenfunctions corresponding to different eigenvalues
as an orthonormal set of eigenfunctions, i.e.

Xm, Xn
h

i

= δmn, m, n = 0, 1, 2, . . .

By making use of the initial conditions and the above orthonormality condition the determination of the constants
An and φn that appear in equation (23) and therefore in the general solution can be done in a systematic way. For
the zero mode, for instance, we have

5 Conservation laws

Linear momentum and mechanical energy conservation theorems can be proven under quite general conditions.
The former depends on the fact that the system is isolated and the latter depends also on the fact that the internal
forces can be considered as conservatives. Let us consider ﬁrst the linear momentum of the system. Our goal will
be to determine explicitly the contribution of the massive spring to the total linear momentum.

The linear momentum due to the two blocks is given by

Making use of equations (9) and (10), we can recast the total time derivative of Pblocks into the form

Pblocks = M1

∂u (0, t)

Since X0 and Xn are orthogonal we see that only the zero mode contributes to the total linear momentum

Ptotal = (M1 + M2 + Mspring) V

From this result we see that the constant V is the velocity of the centre of mass of the system, as expected.
We now consider the mechanical energy of the system. The kinetic energy of the blocks is given by

(cid:19)

which evidently is not per se a conserved quantity because the blocks exchange energy with the spring. It follows
that in order to have conservation of the mechanical energy it is mandatory that any variation of the kinetic energy
of the blocks be compensated by a variation of the energy of the spring, kinetic, potential or both. Keeping this in
mind we derive (44) with respect to the time to obtain

This last result shows that the total energy of the system can be decomposed into a sum of energies each one
associated with a normal mode. Moreover, we can see that in order to excite two or more frequencies of comparable
amplitudes it is necessary to supply the mode with the highest frequency with a greater amount of external energy.

6 Solution for ρ (x) = 0

When the spring is massless the motion of the two blocks is easily obtained by reducing the two-body problem
to the the motion of a single effective body about a centre of force [2]. Here we try to obtain those solutions by
making use of equations (14) and (15).

7 Solution for κ (x) and ρ (x) uniform

We now turn our attention to an important special case. When the elastic function of the spring and its density are
uniform it is possible to solve analytically the equation of motion, i.e. the wave equation that describe the system
and interpret clearly the solutions. Deﬁning

To illustrate the discussion let us consider the situation for which the density of the spring is very small. In this
case the mass of the spring can be neglected. Making the necessary approximations to equation (76) we obtain

The angular frequency is given by equation (70) and in this case it leads to

As expected the last result has a non-trivial limit as the mass density tends to zero. Notice that κ/ℓ can be identiﬁed
with the usual elastic constant of the spring, Notice also that the speed of the wave does depend on the density of
the spring and tends to inﬁnity as the mass density tends to zero. It is precisely this fact that in this approximation
makes possible to replace the real forces by forces between the two point masses obeying Newton’s action and
reaction principle discussed in the introduction. To investigate the next order correction to the angular frequency

we consider for simplicity the case where one of the point masses, say M1, is inﬁnite and the total mass of the
point particles M1 + M2 is also inﬁnite. This situation corresponds to the case where one of the extremities of the
spring is ﬁxed to a wall. Adding one more term to the expansion of tan qℓ in (76) we obtain the following quartic
equation for q

8 The angular eigenfrequencies

In order to investigate a general solution of equation ( 76) let us deﬁne the variable z = qℓ and write the character-
istic equation (76) in the form

where M := M1 + M2. In Figure 2 we plot the lhs and the rhs of equation (83) separately for representative
values of µ, M and m. The solutions of the charcteristic equation are determined by the intersection points. It is
easily seen that there is an inﬁnite number of eigenfrequencies, one in each open interval (nπ, (n + 1)π), where
n is a non-negative integer. The lowest eigenfrequency lies in the interval (0, π). The lowest eigenfrequency is
the only one that remains ﬁnite when the mass of the spring tends to zero. All other eigenfrequencies tend to
inﬁnite and this means that they are increasingly harder to excite. For n
0 the highest eigenfrequencies can be
≫
approximately described by the simple formula zn = nπ. Then we can write

ﬁxed wall.

We can also express the other eigenfrequencies (n > 0) in a series form by using again the B¨urmann-Lagrange

Figures 3 and 4 show the behaviour of the ﬁrst three lowest eigenfrequencies as a function of the mass of the spring
m for a particular choice of the sum of the attached masses M1 + M2. In Figure 4 one of the attached masses is
inﬁnite and the other one is ﬁnite. This means that one of the ends of the spring is attached to a ﬁxed wall. In
Figure 3 both attached masses are ﬁnite. As the mass of the spring tends to zero, the fundamental eigenfrequency
teds to a ﬁnite value and the second and third eigenfrequencies tendo to inﬁnity.

9 Final remarks

In this paper we discussed the classical mechanics of a spring of arbitrary mass coupled to two arbitrary massive
blocks attached at its ends. A general approach to the problem was attempted and some general results such as
the conservation of linear momentum and energy were obtained. We have shown also that the physical problem
leads to an example of a Sturm-Liouville system. The detailed study of this problem is heavily dependent on
the explicit knowledge of the elastic function κ (x). The special case for which the elastic function and the mass
density are uniform was discussed and an approximation procedure to the evaluation of the normal frequencies was
put forward and tested. In the limiting case of a massless spring, we have focused our attention on the motion of
the attached masses M1 and M2, and considered the spring as a way of transmitting the interection between them.
With the respect to the wave motion of the spirng, we observe that the result
Ke/ρ is the velocity of the wave
only if the velocity of the centre of mass of the system is zero. If this velocity is V with respect to some suitable
reference frame then accordding to the galilean rule the velocity of pulse propagation will be V +

p

Ke/ρ.

At the moment, the study of a possible equivalence between motion in a single mode of the massive spring and

simple harmonic motion and possible quantisation of the system is under way.

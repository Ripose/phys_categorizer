ABSTRACT

We discuss, in the context of classical electrodynamics with a Lorentz invariant cut-

oﬀ at short distances, the self-force acting on a point charged particle. It follows that

the electromagnetic mass of the point charge occurs in the equation of motion in a form

consistent with special relativity. We ﬁnd that the exact equation of motion does not

exhibit runaway solutions or non-causal behavior, when the cut-oﬀ is larger than half of

the classical radius of the electron.

I - INTRODUCTION

The calculation of the self-force acting on a charged particle is a long outstanding

problem in electrodynamics since the days of Abraham (1903) and Lorentz (1904), who

derived for the ﬁrst time the radiation reaction force on an extended electron1. Assuming

that the electron has a spherically symmetric rigid charge distribution of radius r0 in its

instantaneous rest frame, they were able to show that a particle subjected to an external

force F ext obeys the following equation of motion:

The factor 4/3 in front of the electromagnetic mass U/c2 in equation (1) is just one

of the several well-known diﬃculties involved in the Abraham-Lorentz theory of charged

particles. To overcome this problem, Poincar´e (1905) suggested that the charged particle

could not be held together unless other attractive and nonelectromagnetic forces were

present. These Poincar´e stresses would add a mass m0 to the electromagnetic mass of

the particle, so that the requirements of special relativity would apply only to the physical,

observed mass m = m0+mel. However, there are two problems with that solution. Firstly,

a charged particle endowed with Poincar´e stresses would be unstable under deformations

of shape which might occur when the particle is acted by external or self-electromagnetic

forces1. Secondly, classical electrodynamics is a covariant theory by itself, so one expects

that a correct calculation should not violate the requirements of Lorentz covariance. The

current point of view is that the electromagnetic energy-momentum used by Abraham,

2

Lorentz and Poincar´e is not a covariant quantity, so that when the covariance condition

is taken properly into account it should furnish the expected factor of unity.2−6

Anyway, the extended electron theory is not compatible with the experimental facts,

which indicate that the electron may be considered as a point particle at least up to

distances of order of 10−16 cm.7

In the point charge limit, all the structure-dependent

constants γn in equation (1) go to zero, but then the electromagnetic mass mel diverges

as 1/r0 when r0 →
assume that the terms involving the γn factors in equation (1) could be disregarded when

0, so that this limit is not meaningful in the Maxwell theory. One may

r0 is very small, provided the changes in the motion of the particle which occur during

short time intervals of order r0/c are negligible. One then obtains the Abraham-Lorentz

equation of motion:

(m0 + mel) ˙v

¨v = F ext

where we have added a mechanical nonelectromagnetic mass m0. As remarked by Feyn-

man8, one would be in trouble only if the energy changes were also inﬁnite. Unfortunately,

this is the case: even if we renormalize the mass, keeping m = m0 + mel ﬁxed as r0 →
the solution of equation (3) when F = 0 would have an exponentially growing accelera-

0,

tion:

˙v(t) = ˙v(0) exp(t/τ )

where τ = 2e2/3mc3. This is called a runaway solution of the Abraham-Lorentz equa-

tion.3−6,8−10 When there is an external force acting on the charged particle, the runaway

solution still persists:

But in this case, the acceleration ˙v(t) would depend on the force F ext(t + t′) at times

greater than t. This non-causal eﬀect, which is more pronunciated during times t′ of

order τ is called preacceleration.

The above behavior indicates that the assumption about the neglect of the γn factors

in this regime may be inconsistent, since during short time intervals of order τ the

changes in the motion of the particle appear to be important. On the other hand it is

well known that due to quantum eﬀects, classical electrodynamics cannot remain valid

at such small distances and time intervals when the runaways and the preacceleration

eﬀects are relevant. Thus, it is possible that a modiﬁcation of the laws of electrodynamics

at short distances might lead to a regularized, causal and runaway-free theory. In fact,

because of the existence of a cut-oﬀ in such a theory, we shall show that the γn terms

are nonvanishing in the point particle limit, being essential for the suppression of the

unphysical runaway solutions.

Some time ago, Coleman11, treating the electron as a point charge from the very be-

ginning, introduced a cut-oﬀ in Maxwell’s electrodynamics. This enabled him to derive

unambiguously the relativistic equation of motion which reduces to equation (3) in the

nonrelativistic limit, called the Lorentz-Dirac equation.9

In his work, the cut-oﬀ was

merely a computational device, whose eﬀects were disregarded at the end of the calcula-

tion. A few years later, Moniz and Sharp12,13,14 have shown in the context of a quantum

theory of the electron, that the interaction of the point electron with his own electro-

magnetic ﬁeld induces eﬀectively a natural cut-oﬀ of order of the electron’s Compton

wavelength λ = ~/mc. This may arise in consequence of the creation of virtual electron-

positron pairs in the neighbourhood of the point electron, which eﬀectively spread-out

its charge distribution. Subsequently, these and other related aspects have been further

investigated by several authors.15−20

4

Based on these facts, we believe that a possible way to remove the divergences, runaway

solutions or noncausal behavior from classical electrodynamics is by the introduction of

a gauge and Lorentz invariant cut-oﬀ at short distances in the Maxwell theory. We shall

use such a cut-oﬀ at the threshold of the classical regime, which allows for the existence

of a ﬁnite and well deﬁned point particle limit. One of the authors21 has recently shown

how calculating the electromagnetic mass in this framework solves the 4/3 problem of the

classical theory. In the regularized classical electrodynamics one ﬁnds the correct factor

of unity in the point charge limit as well as a ﬁnite electromagnetic mass mel = e2/2ℓ c2,

where ℓ is the cut-oﬀ. When ℓ = ~/mc this becomes, apart from a logarithmic factor,

of same order as the electromagnetic mass found in quantum electrodynamics.22

The approach we follow involves adding a new term to the Maxwell Lagrangian, which

leads to an eﬀective Lagrangian for classical electrodynamics that takes into account the

relevant eﬀects from the quantum theory. The form of the new term can be restricted by

a few reasonable and simple properties, which leave the Maxwell theory as unaltered as

possible: (a) The Lagrangian must be gauge and Lorentz invariant.

(b) It should yield

local ﬁeld equations which are still linear in the ﬁeld quantities. The simplest possibility

that includes a cut-oﬀ ℓ leads to a Lagrangian containing second order derivatives of the

electromagnetic potentials Aα = (A, iφ):

where Fαβ = ∂α Aβ −

∂β Aα is the usual electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor and jα = (j, icρ) is

by equation (7) become essentially equivalent to the ﬁelds governed by the usual Maxwell

theory. Such a modiﬁcation of classical electrodynamics was proposed a long time ago by

Podolsky and others.23

In section II we present the calculation of the self-force that acts on a point charged

5

particle, within the framework of the generalized Maxwell theory described by the La-

grangian (7). We evaluate all the terms involving higher order derivatives of the velocity

which appear in the exact equation of motion of a point charged particle. The contribu-

tions of the higher order terms can be summed in closed form, from which the absence of

runaway behavior follows in the case when the cut-oﬀ is larger than half of the classical

radius of the electron. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that in this case the solutions are consis-

tent with the principle of causality. Similar conclusions may be obtained from the exact

equation of motion of a relativistic point charged particle, which is discussed in the last

section.

In

particular, the homogeneous solutions of equation (15) do not display runaway behavior

when m0 is non-negative.

To see this we assume an ansatz of the form r = r0 exp(ηt). There will be no runaway

solutions if the real part of η is negative or vanishes. Then, the possible solutions of

equation (15) in the absence of external forces are determined by the condition that

The solutions of (17) are a subset of those determined by the cubic equation (18).

The solutions of such an equation are well known and it can be veriﬁed that its complex

conjugate roots do not satisfy the original equation (17). Therefore, we are allowed to

write the solutions of (17) as η = cx/ℓ, where x is a real quantity satisfying equation (17)

in the form

where p = 3m0ℓc2/e2 is a dimensionless real parameter. Note that the sign of the

mechanical mass m0 determines that of p.

Apart from the trivial solution x = 0, we must distinguish three cases in order to ﬁnd

the other solutions:

when p = 0.

(i) p = 0. A very simple analysis shows that the left hand side of (19) is always larger

than the right hand side, except when x = 0. Hence, there are no additional solutions

(ii) p > 0. The above argument holds still stronger in this case. Thus, we cannot get

extra solutions in this case either.

(iii) p < 0. There is a continuous set of solutions x = x(p). To see that, consider the

inverse relation p = p(x) which, according to (19), is given by

Since m = m0 + mel, and the electromagnetic mass mel

is given in the regularized

electrodynamics for a point particle by21

mel =

e2
2ℓ c2

,

(21)

(22)

it is possible to express p in terms of the cut-oﬀ ℓ and the classical radius of the electron

r0 = e2/mc2 as:

p =

This shows that p is necessarily larger than

3/2, for both ℓ and r0 are positive

−

constants. Therefore, we are led to the conclusion that x must be restricted to positive

values. Consequently, if p < 0, and hence m0 < 0, η is real and positive and runaway

motion takes place.

We see that runaway solutions can be presented if, and only if, m0 < 0. Expres-

sion (22) shows that this is possible provided ℓ is smaller than half the classical radius

of the electron. It is interesting to examine these solutions in the limit ℓ

0. In this

→

case, we would have x

3ℓ/2r0. Thus, the homogeneous solution of the exact equation

of motion (15) may be written in the limit ℓ

0 as

which is identical to the homogeneous solution (4) of the Abraham-Lorentz equation of

motion (3).

Let us ﬁnally examine the inhomogeneous solution of the regularized equation of mo-

tion (15), corresponding to a nonrelativistic motion of the particle, subject to a time-

dependent external force. This solution is easily obtained after introducing the Fourier

Green function, which is characterized by the fact that its singularities lie in the lower

half of the complex ω-plane,4,20 is well known. Substituting η for (

iω), this property

−

requires that all zeros of the expression in curly brackets in equation (27) must be situated

in the left half of the complex η-plane. But this condition is identical to that given by

equation (16) in connection with the absence of runaway solutions. It then follows from

our previous analysis that no improper solution is present, when the cut-oﬀ is larger than

half the classical radius of the electron.

One important aspect to note is that the removal of runaways and of preacceleration is

intimately related to keeping the higher order terms in the expansion of the self-force.21 In

our framework, these higher order terms do not vanish in the point particle limit because

of the existence of the cut-oﬀ ℓ. Then, the self-force may be written as

The Lorentz-Dirac equation is known to exhibit the familiar maladies of runaway solutions

and noncausal behavior. These problems may be ascribed to the appearance of a negative

bare mass m0 to counterbalance the diverging electromagnetic mass, in order to furnish

the observed, ﬁnite mass m to the point charged particle.

The relativistic equation of motion (31), with Fµ given by the exact expression (35),

predicts in general the same kind of behavior as that described by its nonrelativistic coun-

terpart (15). To understand this feature, we remark that when ℓ < r0/2, the mechanical

mass m0 must be negative in order to ensure the observed value of the physical mass m.

Then, a runaway behavior is consistent with the conservation of energy, which is the sum

of the particle kinetic energy (γ

1)m0c2 and the positive electromagnetic ﬁeld energy.

−

The kinetic energy of a negative mechanical mass, which is negative and decreasing with

the increasing velocity of the particle, can compensate the increase of the ﬁeld energy,

maintaining an overall constant energy.

13

On the other hand, when ℓ is larger than half the classical radius of the electron,

m0 is positive and the particle cannot undergo a runaway motion. Such a motion would

violate the conservation of energy, since it would increase the particle positive mechanical

energy as well as the positive electromagnetic ﬁeld energy. Therefore, we conclude that

if the quantum processes induce in the classical regime an eﬀective cut-oﬀ of order of the

Compton wavelength of the electron, then the exact equation of motion of a point charged

particle will admit only physical solutions.

Studying the problem of wave propagation in dissipative media can be made by

searching for ”resonance modes” or free oscillations regimes. In the present article, a

simple case is investigated, which allows to enlighten the respective interest of diﬀer-

ent, classical methods, without any approximation, some of them being rather deli-

cate. This case is the 1D propagation in a homogeneous medium having two purely

resistive terminations, the calculation of the Green function being done by using

three methods. The ﬁrst one is the straightforward use of the ”compact” solution in

the frequency domain, then the rules of residues. The second one is the expansion

in orthogonal modes in the frequency domain, the modes having eigenfrequencies

depending on the frequency. Calculating the derivative of the eigenfrequencies with

respect to frequency allows to get the same result than the ﬁrst method. Finally the

method of separation of variables (space and time) leads to a solution depending on

the initial conditions, and can be applied to the Green function. The question of the

orthogonality of the (complex) resonance modes is investigated with several points

of view. The results of the three methods generalize or/and correct some results

already existing in the literature. Finally the extension of the problem to a medium

where dissipation is coupled to propagation is investigated.

INTRODUCTION

Studying the problem of wave propagation in dissipative media can be made by searching

for “resonance modes” [1], or free oscillations regimes. Theses modes can be non orthogonal

2

for a certain choice of their product, entailing some diﬃculties depending on the mathemat-

ical treatment, made either in the time or frequency domain. Two classical methods exist

for such a problem:

i) in the frequency domain, the complex dependence of dissipation with respect to fre-

quency does not make impossible the use of orthogonal decomposition, but leads to eigen-

modes and eigenfrequencies depending on frequency. It is the case for the classical theory

of room acoustics (see e.g. Morse and Ingard [2]). To return to time domain in order to

deduce the resonance modes is a rather delicate task, especially because of the calculation

of the derivation of eigenfrequencies with respect to frequency.

ii) in the time domain, the use of time and space variable as separate variables leads

directly to the basis of modes, but they are non orthogonal for the most common product,

entailing diﬃculties when searching the coeﬃcients depending for instance on the initial

conditions. Nevertheless Guyader [3] has solved the problem for a particular case.

The present article is devoted to the study of a special, simple 1D case for which a

straightforward solution exists, by applying the rule of residues to the compact form or

the Fourier domain solution: as discussed by Levine[4], this compact solution, avoiding

the sum of a series, is “relatively poorly, if not entirely, unknown to the general acoustics

community”. For the studied case all calculations can be carried out analytically without any

approximations, exhibiting the properties of the diﬀerent methods. This case corresponds

to the onedimensional propagation in a homogeneous medium bounded by two other semi-

inﬁnite media with diﬀerent characteristic impedances, dissipation being therefore due to

radiation at inﬁnity. This case is especially interesting because of its physical signiﬁcance (it

is probably the simplest radiation problem), and also because it realizes a possible transition

between Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions.

In section II, the equations to be solved are stated, with some possible physical interpre-

tations. As a ﬁrst step, the classical, compact solution in the frequency domain is established

(section III), with its inverse Fourier Transform, corresponding to the successive reﬂections

(section IV). The second step is the use of the rule of residues in order to determine the res-

onance modes (section V, the basic result being given by equation 37). Then the results are

compared to those of the two aforementioned methods, i.e. the method of the eigenmodes in

the frequency domain (section VI), and the method of separation of variables (section VII),

which gives the result for given initial conditions (the corresponding results being equations

3

(3)

66, 77 and 79). Finally an extension to the case where absorption is coupled to propagation

is treated, with some approximated formulas and numerical results, which are compared to

the time domain solutions with successive reﬂections (section VIII).

II. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM, PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION

The Green function g(x, t | x0, t0) for the wave equation is solution of the following

equation:

∂2
xx −

(cid:20)

1
c2 ∂2

tt

(cid:21)

g(x, t | x0, t0) = −δ(x − x0)δ(t − t0),

(1)

where x and x0 are the spatial coordinates of the receiver and source, respectively (or

vice-versa), t and t0 the times of observation and excitation, respectively, c the speed of

sound. δ(x) is the Dirac function.

For sake of simplicity, x0 and t0 are considered to be ﬁxed, and the following notation is

used : g(x, t) = g(x, t | x0, t0). Moreover in the whole paper, the choice of t0 = 0 is made,

except for the ﬁnal results. For negative t, the function is zero, as well as its ﬁrst derivative.

The Green function satisﬁes the following boundary conditions:

and

∂xg(x, t) =

∂tg(x, t) at x = 0,

∂xg(x, t) = −

∂tg(x, t) at x = ℓ.

cζ

cζℓ

where ζ = Z/ρc, ρ is the density of the ﬂuid, and Z the impedance at x = 0, which is

assumed to be a real quantity, independent of the frequency. Possible corresponding physical

problems are discussed hereafter. Similarly, ζℓ = Zℓ/ρc , where Zℓ is the impedance at x = ℓ

(ℓ being positive).

An obvious physical interpretation for the quantities ζ and ζℓ is the following: consider

for x < 0 and x > ℓ (see ﬁgure 1) two media with characteristic impedances ρ−c− and ρ+c+,

respectively. If the media are non dissipative, the impedances are real, and can be larger

or smaller than the impedance of the bounded medium, ρc. Moreover, they are positive,

because they correspond to waves outgoing from the bounded medium. Therefore this is

the problem of planar pressure waves in a stratiﬁed medium, the direction of propagation

FIG. 1: 1D medium bounded with two other media

being normal to the interfaces. A generalization to more complex stratiﬁed media would

be possible, at least numerically. In this problem, the Green function corresponds to the

acoustic pressure: of course, it has not the dimension of a pressure, but the solution for a

“concrete” problem with source can be easily solved, as explained in standard textbooks,

and discussed in a recent paper by Levine[4].

Other problems can correspond to the previous equations :

i) in an approximate way, ignoring higher order duct modes, the problem of planar waves

in a duct terminating in two semi-inﬁnite ducts with diﬀerent cross sections areas, the quan-

tities ζ and ζℓ being the ratios of the areas. The approximation is good at low frequencies.

ii) the problem of absorbing termination : the terminal impedances Z and Zℓ can be the

impedances of absorbing media (at low frequencies, a porous medium open to a large space

can be an approximation of a pure resistance, due to viscous eﬀects).

In all the previous problems, the quantities ζ and ζℓ are real and positive, the terminations

being passive. If the termination is active, they can be negative. An example is the beginning

of self-sustained oscillations in musical instruments: a nonlinear excitator, like a reed for a

clarinet, can be linearized as a pure resistance. When the main control parameter, i.e. the

pressure in the mouth of the musician, increases, the resistance becomes negative and the

static regime becomes unstable, and an oscillation starts as an increasing exponential (see

e.g. [5]).

III. COMPACT SOLUTION FOR THE FOURIER TRANSFORM

The Fourier Transform of g(x, t) is denoted G(x, ω). It is equal to :

G(x, ω) =

g(x, t)e−iωtdt,

where

g(x, t) =

G(x, ω)eiωtdω.

The Fourier Transform of equation (1), is found to be:

and similarly for the boundary conditions (2) and (3) :

G(x, ω) at x = ℓ.

We notice the diﬃculty of the problem treated by the present article: while the terminal

impedances are independent of frequency, the boundary conditions are frequency dependent.

Nevertheless a classical, compact, solution is well known, as explained hereafter. If x 6= x0

the solutions of equation (6) can be written as

In order to satisfy the boundary conditions, the following deﬁnition is used:

ζ = coth η ; ζℓ = coth ηℓ

(as we will see later, the quantities η and ηℓ can be either real or complex, depending on

the values of ζ and ζℓ).

(12)

and a similar result if x ≤ x0, by interchanging x and x0.

The case ζ = 1 (semi-inﬁnite tube or medium) corresponds to η = ∞ : it is discussed in

the next subsection.

IV. SOLUTION IN THE TIME DOMAIN (SUCCESSIVE REFLECTIONS)

Equation (12) can be transformed in the time domain, leading to a solution corresponding

to the successive reﬂections of the Green function in inﬁnite space at the two boundaries.

It will be the reference solution for the check of the validity of the modal expansion. The

second factor of the denominator can be written as

1
sinh(iωℓ/c + η + ηℓ)

=

2e−η−ηℓ−iωℓ/c
1 − e−2η−2ηℓ−2iωℓ/c ,

and, if the modulus of the exponential at the denominator is less than unity (this is

discussed hereafter), as:

where

1
sinh(iωℓ/c + η + ηℓ)

= 2e−η−ηℓ−iωℓ/c

1 + F (ω) + F 2(ω) + F 3(ω) + ...
i
h

,

F (ω) = e−2η−2ηℓ−2iωℓ/c

is the function corresponding to a complete round trip of a wave in the tube, of duration
2ℓ/c. The quantities r = e−2η and rℓ = e−2ηℓ are the reﬂection coeﬃcients at the boundaries

and are equal to:

r = e−2η = (ζ − 1)/(ζ + 1) ; rℓ = e−2ηℓ = (ζℓ − 1)/(ζℓ + 1).

(16)

Concerning the numerator of (12) , it can be written as follows :

cosh

Gp(x, ω) = e−iω(x−x0)/c + re−iω(x+x0)/c

+rℓe−iω(2ℓ−x−x0)/c + rrℓe−iω(2ℓ−x+x0)/c.

Therefore the Green function in the frequency domain is:

G(x, ω) =

Gp(x, ω)

c
4πiω

1 + F (ω) + F 2(ω) + F 3(ω) + ...
i

.

The factor Gp(x, ω)/iω corresponds to the four “primary” waves arriving during the ﬁrst

cycle of duration 2ℓ/c, and this packet is simply reproduced at times 2ℓ/c, 4ℓ/c, 6ℓ/c, etc...

(see for a detailed explanation e.g. Kergomard [5]). The inverse Fourier Transform of the

function G(x, ω)/iω is now easily obtained as

∂tg(x, t) =

cgp(x, t) ∗ [δ(t) + f (t) + f (t) ∗ f (t) + f (t) ∗ f (t) ∗ f (t) + ...] ,

(20)

gp(x, t) = δ(t − (x − x0)/c) + r(t) ∗ δ(t − (x + x0)/c) + rℓ(t) ∗

δ(t − (2ℓ − x − x0)/c) + r(t) ∗ rℓ(t) ∗ δ(t − (2ℓ − x + x0)/c),

(21)

r(t) = rδ(t) , rℓ(t) = rℓδ(t)

f (t) = r(t) ∗ rℓ(t) ∗ δ(t − 2ℓ/c).

Finally, calculating the integral hp(x, t) of the function gp(x, t), with the condition for

negative times, the ﬁnal result is found to be, whatever the sign of (x − x0):

g(x, t) =

hp(x, t) ∗ [δ(t) + f (t) + f (t) ∗ f (t) + f (t) ∗ f (t) ∗ f (t) + ...] ,

hp(x, t) = H [t − |x − x0| /c] + rH [t − (x + x0)/c] +

8

(26)

and

f (t) = rrℓδ(t − 2ℓ/c),

H(t) being the step function. The condition of validity of the expansion (14) is |rrℓ| < 1 .

We notice that if ζ is real and positive, |r| < 1, and similarly for ζℓ. Therefore the condition

is satisﬁed when the two boundaries are absorbing, or, more precisely, if the combination

of the two reﬂections is absorbing. What happens in the case |rrℓ| > 1? It is possible to

replace equation (13) by an equivalent expression with 1 − e2η+2ηℓ+2iωℓ/cat the denominator,

but this would correspond to an inﬁnite series of non causal functions in the time domain:

the question will be discussed in section V C.

Otherwise if r is positive (|ζ| > 1), η is real, and if r is negative (|ζ| < 1), η = µ + iπ/2,

where µ is real; a similar remark can be made for the end ℓ. The most of the following

calculations are valid for all cases, η and ηℓ being real or complex.

Finally, if ζ (respectively ζℓ) is unity, the reﬂection coeﬃcient r (respectively rℓ)vanishes,

as well as f (t): the ﬁrst term of the Green function is the Green function of an inﬁnite

medium, the ﬁrst two terms correspond to a semi-inﬁnite medium, etc... As it will be seen

in the next section, no modes can be found for these cases, because either η or ηℓ tends to

inﬁnity.

V. EXPANSION IN RESONANCE MODES USING THE INVERSE FOURIER

TRANSFORM

Putting the expression in the frequency domain (12) in the equation (5) leads to the

modal expansion of the time domain expression. The tool is the rule of residues. If all the

poles of the expression (12) are simple and located on or above the real axis, the following

equation can be used:

g(x, t) = 2πiΣ if t > 0 and 0 if t < 0,

(27)

where Σ is the sum of the residues (see e.g. Morse and Ingard[2] p 17, changing i in −i).

A. Calculation of the poles

9

(28)

(29)

The poles corresponding to the zeros of function sinh satisfy:

or

sinh

#

+ η + ηℓ = inπ,

where n is an integer.

In order for the poles to be above the real axis, the condition

is Re(η + ηℓ) > 0. It is equivalent to the condition previously obtained for the successive

reﬂections expansion : |rrℓ| < 1.

Depending on the values of ζ and ζℓ, diﬀerent cases must be distinguished :

i) if |ζ| > 1 and |ζℓ| > 1 (real η and ηℓ):

ωn =

nπc
ℓ

+ i

(η + ηℓ)c
ℓ

; n = −∞, .... − 2, −1, 0, 1, 2... + ∞.

(30)

As already remarked by Filippi[1] or Guyader [3], the imaginary part of the complex fre-

quency is independent of n, and the real part is independent of the absorption, corresponding

to the values for pure Neumann conditions (inﬁnite ζ and ζℓ).

ii) if |ζ| < 1 and |ζℓ| < 1 (complex η and ηℓ: η = µ + iπ/2; ηℓ = µℓ + iπ/2 ):

ωn =

nπc
ℓ

+ i

(µ + µℓ)c
ℓ

; n = −∞, .... − 2, −1, 0, 1, 2... + ∞.

(31)

The imaginary part is still independent of n , and the real part independent of the

absorption, corresponding to the values for pure Dirichlet conditions (zero ζ and ζℓ).

iii) if |ζ| > 1 and |ζℓ| < 1 (real η and complex ηℓ : ηℓ = µℓ + iπ/2 )

For this mixed case

ωn =

mπc
2ℓ

+ i

(η + µℓ)c
ℓ

; m = −∞, .... − 3, −1, 1, 3... + ∞,

(32)

where m = 2n − 1 is an odd integer. The real part corresponds to a problem with

Neumann and Dirichlet conditions at x = 0 at x = ℓ, respectively. The last (mixed) case

(|ζ| < 1 and |ζℓ| > 1) is obvious, and is not treated here.

B. Calculation of the residues

In all cases, the Taylor expansion of the function sinh in equation (12) at the ﬁrst order

of the quantity (ω − ωn) can be determined. The result is:

sinh

ωℓ
c

i
"

+ η + ηℓ

= i(−1)n(ω − ωn)

#

.

Thus, for ω close to the pole ωn:

G(x, ω) = −

c2
2πωnℓ

cosh [η + iωnx0/c] cosh [ηℓ + iωn(ℓ − x)/c]
(−1)n(ω − ωn)

,

or, using equation (29)

G(x, ω) = −

c2
2πωnℓ

cosh [η + iωnx0/c] cosh [η + iωnx/c]
(ω − ωn)

.

The residue corresponding to the pole ω = 0, remains to be calculated. For small ω,

G(x, ω) =

Finally, using equation (27), the inverse FT of G(x, ω) is obtained, as follows:

where

g(x, t) = H(t)

fn(x) = cosh(η + iωnx/c) = (−1)n cosh(iωn(ℓ − x)/c + ηℓ).

This formula is valid for all aforementioned cases, which are detailed in Appendix A.

Some comments can be made:

- the mode shapes fn(x) are complex functions of the space variable, and the question of

their orthogonality will be discussed in section VII;

- the decreasing of the modes is identical for all non constant modes;

- there are two non oscillating modes, corresponding to the poles ω = ω0 and ω = 0;

- if one of the impedances ζ or ζℓ is zero, the constant mode disappears, as it is intuitive,

in order to satisfy a Dirichlet condition;

- for the three considered cases in Appendix A, we notice that

ω−n = −ω∗

n and fn(x) = f ∗

−n(x).

Comparison between the successive reﬂections method and modal expansion (102 modes, i.e. max-

imum n = 50). Locations of the source and receiver are x0 = 0.1m and x = 0.5m, respectively.
The scale for the y-axis corresponds to c = 340 m.s−1. Notice that constant mode is equal to
−628.5 m.s−1.

As a consequence, the solution g(x, t) is real. It could be possible to transform the sum by

adding the two terms corresponding to n and −n, as it is usually done for non absorbing

boundaries. Nevertheless it appears that the formulas become intricate.

- when the boundaries tend to non absorbing boundaries, the result tends to the classical

result. A particular case occurs when both ζ and ζℓ tend to inﬁnity (η and ηℓ tend to zero)

: the combination of the mode of frequency ω0 and the constant mode results in a mode

increasing linearly with time, equal to H(t) tc2/ℓ.

- equations (35) and (36) lead directly to another form of the Fourier Transform of the

result given by (37), written as a series.

An example of comparison of the successive reﬂections method and modal expansion is

shown in ﬁgure 2. We notice that it is satisfactory and that the Gibbs phenomenon appears,

because of the truncated series of modes.

C. The case of active boundaries

12

What happens when the combination of boundaries is active, i.e. when |rrℓ| > 1, or

Re(η + ηℓ) < 0 (at least one of the impedances ζ or ζℓ is negative)? An equation similar

to equation (27) can be used, leading to a non causal solution, as well as the solution with

successive reﬂections, as discussed in section IV. This solution is easy to ﬁnd, replacing

(t − t0) by −(t − t0), ζ by −ζ, ζℓ by −ζℓ in the equations (1 to 3), but it is not the Green

function. On the contrary, it is possible to prove that equations (24) and (37) remain valid

for active boundary conditions. The detailed solution given in appendix A exhibits that

if a new function

g(x, t) = g(x, t) exp(−

ηt), where

η > − Re(η + ηℓ) > 0 can be substituted

in the initial problem, equation (1) becomes

(6 to 8), where G(x, ω) is replaced by

G(x, ω) and iω by (iω +

for equation (12). The analysis of both successive reﬂections and poles and residues leads

e

to the result

g(x, t) = g(x, t) exp(−

ηt), where g(x, t) is given by equations (24) and (37),

respectively, and the proof is achieved. We do not repeat here the complete procedure.

VI. EIGENMODES EXPANSION IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN, AND ITS

INVERSE FOURIER TRANSFORM

A. Eigenmodes expansion in the frequency domain

In order to calculate the inverse Fourier Transform of G(x, ω), another solution is possible:

the expansion of G(x, ω) in (orthogonal) eigenmodes. This is done for a particular case by

Filippi ([1]) (this author considers another type of excitation instead of the Dirac function,

thus uses the Laplace Transform instead of the Fourier Transform). We will see how this

method leads to the same poles and residues that the direct method using the compact

expression (12). We are searching for the following expansion :

where the eigenmodes Gn(x, ω) are solutions of the equation

G(x, ω) =

Gn(x, ω),

n
X

∂2

"

θ2
n(ω)
c2 #

Gn(x, ω) = 0,

and satisfy the boundary conditions (7) and (8). θn(ω) are the eigenvalues. The key point

is that the eigenmodes Gn(x, ω) and eigenvalues θn(ω) depend on the frequency ω because

of the boundary conditions. The solutions of equation (41) can be written as follows :

Gn(x, ω) = cosh(iθn(ω)x/c + ϕn(ω))

where θn(ω) and ϕn(ω) are given by the boundary conditions. Thus they satisfy:

θn(ω) tanh ϕn(ω) =

ω
ζ

and

θn(ω) tanh(iθn(ω)ℓ/c + ϕn(ω)) = −

Eliminating quantity ϕn(ω), the eigenvalues are found to satisfy the following equation:

tanh(iθn(ω)ℓ/c)

θn(ω) +
"

ω2
θn(ω)ζζℓ #

When θn(ω) and ω are not simultaneously zero, this equation can be rewritten as:

.

ζ

"

e2iθnℓ/c =

θnζ − ω
θnζ + ω # "

θnζℓ − ω

.

The calculation of all solutions of this equation is not necessary, only a few number

of them being useful in the following. We notice that orthogonality of the eigenmodes is

ensured, and the norm of the modes is equal to:

In order to calculate the inverse Fourier Transform, the rule of residues will be used again.

The only terms of the series contributing to poles verify:

θn(ω) = ±ω.

(49)

Looking at equation (46), it can be seen that these two solutions lead to the same equation

for ω. Rewriting equation (46) by using equations (43) and (44), the resonance modes

frequencies are found to be solution of equation (28):

The solutions ωp of this equation are the non zero poles of the integral in the inverse FT.

Nevertheless the pole ω = 0 exists again, because the zero value satisﬁes equation (49), the

eigenvalue θn(ω) = 0 satisfying equation (45)!

It remains to calculate the residues. Starting with the poles ωp 6= 0, we need to select

in the series (48) the terms involving poles. For a given ωp, there are two terms. However

it appears that the modes corresponding to θn and −θn are identical. As a consequence,

only one term of the series contributes to the inverse FT: it will be denoted θp(ω). The

corresponding residue is found by expanding equation (48) for ω close to ωp, as follows:

G(x, ω) =

Similar expression can be found in Filippi [1], which points out that Morse and Ingard

forgot the derivative (reference [2], p. 559). An interesting remark is that the derivative
of θp(ω), denoted θ′

p(ω) can be calculated analytically, as follows. Taking the derivative of

equation (46) with respect to ω, or more conveniently, taking the logarithmic derivative of

equations (43) and (44), the following results are obtained:

Using equation (48), the residue for the pole ω = 0 is obtained, and equation (36) is

domain leads to the same result (equation (37)) than the “direct” method. Nevertheless the

derivation is more delicate.

VII. METHOD OF SEPARATION OF VARIABLES

Guyader[3] has treated a particular case of the problem (zero ζ , large ζℓ ) using the

method of separation of variables, as well as Cox and Zuazua [6], which studied the

case of a non homogenous medium. He get non orthogonal modes for the inner product

ℓ
0 fn(x)fp(x)dx . We will see that the method is valid whatever the values of the boundary
R
conditions, and that the derivation can be largely simpliﬁed. Finally the expression of the

Green function is checked and orthogonality of the modes is discussed.

A. Solutions with separated variables

We are searching for the solutions p(x, t) of homogeneous equation (1) (without second

member), with the boundary conditions (2) and (3), and with given initial conditions. As-

suming that the general solution of the problem is a superposition of solutions with separate

variables (this will be proven, at least for the case of the Green function, if the results

are identical to the previous ones), the solutions with separate variables are written in the

following form:

where

and

and

thus

equation (61):

p(x, t) = f (x)h(t),

h(t) = B+eiωt + B−e−iωt

f (x) = cosh(iωx/c + ϕ).

sinh(ϕ − η) = 0

f (x) = cosh(iωx/c + η).

sinh(iωℓ/c + η + ηℓ) = 0,

The decomposition (58) diﬀers from the ordinary Fourier transform, because a priori ω

is a complex quantity, depending on the boundary conditions. Considering ﬁrst the solution

B+eiωt, this leads to :

ω sinh ϕ =

cosh ϕ

ω
ζ

ω
ζℓ

ω sinh(iωℓ/c + ϕ) = −

cosh(iωℓ/c + ϕ).

ω = 0 is a solution, corresponding to the constant mode. The other modes are given by

Actually there is a sign ± in the right-hand side member of equation (64), but it is

without importance, because it can be included in the coeﬃcient B+ of the solution. The

eigenvalues equation is deduced from equations (63) and (62), as follows:

which is identical to (28), the solutions of which being already studied. The solution in
time B−e−iωt does not lead to new solutions for f (x), therefore the general solution of the

problem can be written as:

p(x, t) =

Anφn(x, t) + A =

Anfn(x)eiωnt + A,

(66)

where ωn and fn(x) are given by equations (29) and (38), respectively, and the coeﬃcients

An and A depend on the initial conditions, and can be determined using the orthogonality

relation of the modes.

B. Orthogonality relation of the modes

In order to derive an orthogonality relation of the modes the following bilinear form is

calculated:

Λnp =

fn(x)fp(x)dx.

Z

(67)

Because fn(x) = f ∗

−n(x), the calculation of the quantities deﬁned in equation (67) for all

values of the index n is equivalent to the calculation of the quantities deﬁned when replacing

fp(x) by its conjugate.

For ωp 6= ωn, because ωp + ωn 6= 0, the result is deduced. For ωp = ωn, the calculation is

Modes are found to be non orthogonal for the product deﬁned by (67), but, as shown by

Guyader[3], it is possible to solve the problem from the knowledge of initial conditions. A

discussion on orthogonality is given in the subsection VII E. When absorption tends to zero
(η and ηℓ tend to zero), the ﬁrst term does not vanish, tending to 1

2 ℓδn(−p). It is due to the

choice of considering separately the modes ωn and ω−n.

Finally we notice that formula (68) remains valid when one of the modes is the constant

mode f (x) = 1, and the other one a non constant mode:

The coeﬃcient A remains to be determined. Using a similar calculation starting from

What is the condition for which this coeﬃcient vanishes? If for instance at x = 0, ζ is

zero, η is inﬁnite, and, according to the boundary condition, p(0, 0) vanishes, thus A vanishes

too. This conﬁrms the remark concerning result (37).

D. Deduction of the Green function

How is it possible to check the accordance between formula (37) and the previous results?

Using an integral formulation (in the time domain) in order to deduce the solution of the

problem with initial conditions from the knowledge of the Green function leads to heavy

calculations. We prefer to check that, for the particular case of the Green function, the

results of the present section are valid. For this purpose, we use the knowledge of the time

domain solution for the Green function (equation (24)).

First we will determine the integrals involved in equation (77). On one hand, for t −→ 0+,

g(x, t) is equivalent to the Green function in inﬁnite space,

Thus it tends to c2fp(x0). The initial quantities p(0, 0) et p(ℓ, 0) being zero, result (37)

is veriﬁed for positive times. Similarly, concerning the constant mode (equation 79), the

integral

ℓ
0 ∂tg(x, t)dx tends to c2, and the result is also veriﬁed.

E. Discussion on the orthogonality

Two remarks can be made concerning the non orthogonality found in equations (69) and

(70) for the product deﬁned in (67): i) it can be interpreted by taking into account that the

studied system produces energy outside of the interval [0, ℓ] , using the ﬁrst interpretation

of the problem to be solved (see ﬁgure 1). ii) another product can be deﬁned, leading to a

true orthogonality condition. These remarks are examined hereafter.

1.

Inﬂuence of the energy outside the studied medium

We consider the problem extended to the two outside media, between −∞ and 0 , and

between ℓ and +∞. The complete medium is viewed as an inhomogeneous medium, with

two jumps in density ρ or/and sound velocity c. In order to solve this new problem, all the

previous methods can be applied, and we choose the separation of variables. When using

this method, neither the time dependence ωn of the solutions, nor the functions fn(x) are

changed in the interval [0, ℓ].

In order to deduce the solutions outside this interval, the

continuity at x = 0 (a similar reasoning is done at x = ℓ, but not given here) of pressure p

and velocity, i.e. the spatial derivative of the pressure divided by the density, ∂xp/ρ is used:

p− = p and ∂xp−/ρ− = ∂xp/ρ.

(80)

In order to obtain orthogonal modes, it is necessary to ensure the continuity of

the wronskian fn(x)∂xfp(x)− fp(x)∂xfn(x) at these abscissae. It means that it is necessary

to change the function solution of the homogeneous equation (1). Replacing p(x, t) by
q(x, t) = p(x, t) [ρ/ρ(x)]1/2, the following continuity conditions at x = 0 are obtained:

q−(x, t)(ρ−/ρ)1/2 = q(x, t) and ∂xq−(x, t)/(ρ−/ρ)1/2 = q(x, t).

(81)

21

(83)

(84)

This change of function, keeping the function unchanged in the interval [0, ℓ] , ensures the

nullity of the wronskian, and is equivalent, for a continuous inhomogeneity, to the reduction
ρ ∂x − 1
out term involving derivative of ﬁrst order, by changing p(x, t) in q(x, t) = p(x, t)/ρ1/2(x).

p(x, t) = 0 in its canonical form, with-

It remains to calculate the solution of the wave equation for negative x: using, for the

absorbing case (Re(η + ηℓ) > 0), the condition of vanishing ﬁeld when x tends to −∞, and

the continuity condition, the result for the modes of q(x, t) is

fn(x) = (ρ/ρ−)1/2 cosh(η) exp(−iωnx/c−) for x < 0

(82)

and for the “constant” mode

f (x) = (ρ/ρ−)1/2.

The orthogonality integral is given by:

If ηℓ is zero, the integrals given by the last two equations correspond to the terms re-

sponsible for the non orthogonality in equations (69) and (70), respectively, provided that

c− = c. If ηℓ is not zero, a similar calculation can be done for ℓ < x < +∞. We conclude

that an interpretation of the non orthogonality can be done by interpreting the jump in

characteristic impedances in 0 and ℓ as a jump in densities ρ− and ρ+, respectively, in the

two outside media: considering the entire space, orthogonality is ensured for the product

2. Change in product of modes

For vibrating systems, the product deﬁned by (67) corresponds to the product with

respect to the mass. It is interesting to calculate the product related to the stiﬀness (see

As a consequence, the initial conditions need to be written by using the derivatives of

the function p(x, t) with respect to the abscissa and time, respectively. Result (77) can

be checked by integrating the ﬁrst term of the integral by parts. Nevertheless, the scalar

product (87) is not useful for the constant mode, and the ﬁrst method needs to be used (see

subsection VII C).

VIII. GENERALIZATION WHEN ADDING ABSORPTION TO

PROPAGATION

A. Statement of the problem

Returning to the initial problem in a bounded medium, we will now consider absorption

in the medium.

In general absorption is frequency-dependent (see e.g. Pierce[8]), but

for simplicity we assume a coeﬃcient, α, independent of both the space coordinate and the

frequency, and we assume arbitrarily the following form for a traveling wave in the frequency

domain:

exp(−αx) exp(iωx/c). For frequency-dependent absorption, it can be assumed

that the obtained formulas can be regarded to be valid by replacing α by its value for the

frequency corresponding to a given mode. This is in general satisfactory for small losses, but

is not discussed further hereafter. For structural vibration, our model is called “proportional

damping” (see e.g. Woodhouse[9], or Adhikari[10] and an application in vibroacoustics see

Mattei [11]). Our interest in this section is limited to the study of the resonance modes and

their frequencies.

In the frequency domain, equation (6) is replaced by the following :

B. Calculation of the frequencies

The poles corresponding to the function sinh are solutions of

zℓ + χ(z) + χℓ(z) = inπ.

For n 6= 0, the modulus of the solutions z are expected to be large, thus this of α/z is

small, and a perturbation method can be used. To the zeroth order of α/z, the solution is

given by equation (28) :

z(0)ℓ = −η − ηℓ + inπ.

Writing the unknown χ(2) = η + ε, and calculating the quantity tanh(χ(2)) by using

equations (91), the following (exact) result is obtained

tanh ε = −

which, with a similar result for χ(2)
ℓ

, leads to the value of z(2), deduced from equation

(92). This method can be iterated, in order to converge to the exact result. Some comments

can be made :

- because of the term (ζ 2 − 1) at the denominator, the perturbation method is not

appropriate when one of the boundary coeﬃcient is close to this of an anechoic termination,

therefore we have tried to determine the limit of the method. Numerical calculations have

been done and presented in section VIII E;

- such a perturbation method does not allow to know the exact number of solutions of

equation (92) ; we assume that if (ζ 2 − 1) is not too small, the number of solutions remains

the same as for the case of zero α ;

- we notice that if (ζ 2 − 1) is not small, the real part of z(0) is small, whatever the

considered case (η and ηℓ being real or complex), compared to the imaginary part, because

n 6= 0 : as a consequence, the perturbation is signiﬁcant for the real part of the frequencies

ωn, and negligible for its imaginary part, i.e. the attenuation rate. Moreover the eﬀect of

losses decreases when n increases, which is obvious when looking at equation (89). The

result at the ﬁrst order of the perturbation can be written as follows :

i

(96)

The question of the poles corresponding to the case n = 0, for which a real solution can

be expected is not treated in general, but for an example in section VIII E. Obviously, it

remains also the pole z = 0.

C. Calculation of the residues

As done in section V B, the Taylor expansion of the function sinh(zℓ + χ + χℓ) to the ﬁrst

order in (ω − ωn) has to be determined to calculate the residues. We get

sinh(zℓ + χ + χℓ) = (ω − ωn)(−1)n Γn,

where χn = χ(zn) and χℓn = χℓ(zn), Therefore the residue of G(x, ω) at ω = ωn , for n 6= 0,

is given by

D. Successive reﬂections

(98)

(99)

(100)

Using the same procedure as for the lossless case (see section IV), the transformation

of equation (90) leads to the solution in the time domain. The addition of losses has

implication in the expression of the Green function of the primary waves (see eq.(18)) with
the appearing of an exponentially damped factor e−αct. It also modiﬁes the characterization

of the reﬂections at the boundaries which are no longer described by constant values but by

functions depending on time. As a consequence, products in equations (25) and (26) have

to be replaced by convolution products. Finally, the Green function in the time domain

becomes

c
2

g(x, t) =

gp(x, t) ∗ [δ(t) + f (t) + f (t) ∗ f (t) + f (t) ∗ f (t) ∗ f (t) + ...]

(101)

where the factor corresponding to the primary waves gp is given by

gp(x, t) = e−αctcH(t − |x − x0| /c) + r(t) ∗ [e−αctH [t − (x + x0)/c] +

rℓ(t) ∗ [e−αctH(t − (2ℓ − x − x0)/c)] + r(t) ∗ rℓ(t) ∗ [e−αctH(t − (2ℓ − |x − x0|)/c)],
(102)

the function f (t) is

f (t) = e−2αℓr(t) ∗ rℓ(t) ∗ δ(t − 2ℓ/c)

E. An example for ζℓ = 0 (Dirichlet condition at x=ℓ)

We consider the case of a Dirichlet condition at x = ℓ (ζℓ = 0, χℓ = iπ/2). Poles are given

by the equation

zℓ + χ(z) = imπ/2,

(105)

where m = 2n − 1 is a (non zero) odd integer. It is easy to check that z = 0 is not a pole

of G(x, ω), because both the numerator and the denominator vanish. If |ζ| > 1, it can be

shown that no real solution exists, so that the perturbation method can be applied for all

poles, which are given to ﬁrst order by

When |ζ| < 1, ζ = tanh µ, where µ = η − iπ/2, and equation (105) can be replaced by

zℓ + κ(z) = inπ,

where n is an integer, and κ(z) = χ(z) − iπ/2. The ﬁrst order solution is given by the

For n = 0, we recognize a particular case, because the perturbation method cannot be

applied if µ is small. Nevertheless, using equations (91) and (92), the unknown z is found

formula:

If µ is small, zℓ is expected to be small as well, and a series expansion of the coth function

We notice that to the ﬁrst order of µ, the two expressions (107) and (109) are identical.

It means that for small ζ, the ﬁrst order approximation is good, while the second order one

is not: in equation (95), there is a factor ζ at the numerator of the ﬁrst order term, but not

in the bracket involving the second order term.

Figure 3 shows the variation of the real part of the frequencies with respect to parameter

ζ, chosen to be positive. When ζ is not close to unity, the variation of frequency is small,

and the ﬁrst order of the iteration computation (equations 106 and 107) is satisfactory. For

ζ approaching unity, the iterative computation converges, but it is not true for ζ very close

For large ζ the real part of the frequencies are close to the frequencies of the Neumann-

Dirichlet problem, and for small ζ, the frequencies are close to the frequencies of the

Dirichlet-Dirichlet problem. According to equations (106) and (107), because ζ is posi-

tive, the frequencies are smaller than the frequencies for zero α if ζ is larger than unity, and

larger if ζ is smaller than unity. For ζ smaller than 0.5 the relative eﬀect of the losses on

the real part of the ﬁrst frequency is less than 0.03%, while when it is larger than 2.0, this

eﬀect is smaller than 0.25%.

ζ < 1, respectively.

Figure 4 shows the result of the same calculation for the imaginary part of the ﬁrst

frequency (m = 1 for ζ > 1; n = 1 for ζ < 1), corresponding to the attenuation. The ﬁrst

order approximation is excellent. Obviously it is a fortiori true for higher order frequencies.

Figure 5 shows the result for n = 0 when ζ < 1. Equation (109) is satisfactory for small ζ,

while the numerical, iterative method fails.

Examples of numerical calculation of the Green function can now be computed. Figures

6 and 7 show the results for the modal expansion method and for the successive reﬂections

method, for two cases with negative ζ (active termination) and with positive ζ (passive

termination), respectively. For both cases |ζ| > 1. The agreement is satisfactory for a

number of 100 modes (m = −101 to m = 101).

IX. CONCLUSION

The studied simple problem we have studied, which can be regarded in particular as a ra-

diation problem, exhibits interesting properties for the resonance modes: they are complex,

and non orthogonal for the simple product (67) because of the bounded character of the con-

sidered medium, but except the constant mode, their are orthogonal for a product modiﬁed

in a proper way. When interpreting the absorbing boundaries as interfaces with semi-inﬁnite

media with diﬀerent densities, they are orthogonal for the simple product. When losses are

ignored in the propagation, their frequencies are independent of the parameters for bound-

ary conditions on the same type, i.e. for terminating impedances involved in either interval

[0, 1[ or interval ]1, +∞[.

modes. Locations of the source and receiver are x0 = 0.1m and x = 0.2m, respectively.

When losses are taken into account, the variation of the imaginary part of the frequen-

cies (i.e. attenuation), and, to a smaller extent, the real part of them, is small when the

boundary impedances vary, except near unity, when the medium tends to be (semi-)inﬁnite.

Approximation formulas are excellent.

Thanks to the simplicity of the problem, the analytical treatment is possible with several

methods, enlightening the relationship between them, which can be useful for more intricate

problems. Active boundaries can also be considered, thanks to a change in functions.

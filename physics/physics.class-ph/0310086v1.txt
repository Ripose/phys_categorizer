Abstract

This short article is not meant to be understood as a paper on the foundations of physics,
but purely concerned with the application of Newtonian mechanics to the dynamics of
In
skiing. We neglect relativistic corrections, as well as quantum mechanical eﬀects.
addition, we should mention that the paper contains a lengthy didactic presentation of a
speciﬁc example of vector calculus. Nevertheless, rather general statements governing the
dynamics of a skier’s trajectory can be obtained on the basis of an elementary analysis.

Ideal carving occurs when a snowboarder or skier, equipped with a snowboard or carving
skis, describes a perfect carved turn in which the edges of the ski alone, not the ski surface,
describe the trajectory followed by the skier, without any slipping nor skidding. In this
article, we derive the ideal-carving equation which describes the physics of a carved turn
under ideal conditions. The laws of Newtonian classical mechanics are applied. The
parameters of the ideal-carving equation are the inclination of the ski slope, the acceleration
of gravity, and the sidecut radius of the ski. The variables of the ideal-carving equation are
the velocity of the skier, the angle between the trajectory of the skier and the horizontal,
and the instantaneous curvature radius of the skier’s trajectory. Relations between the
slope inclination and the velocity range suited for nearly ideal carving are discussed, as
well as implications for the design of carving skis and raceboards.

Introduction

The physics of skiing has recently been described in a very interesting and comprehensive book [1]
which also contains further references of interest. The current article is devoted to a discussion of the
forces acting on a skier or snowboarder, and to the derivation of an equation which describes “ideal
carving”, including applications of this concept in practice and possible speculative implications for
the design of technically advanced skis and snowboards. In a carved turn, it is the bent, curved edge of
the ski or snowboard which forms some sort of “railroad track” along which the trajectory of the curve
is being followed, as opposed to more traditional curves which are triggered by deliberate slippage of
the bottom surface of the ski relative to the snow.

The edges of traditional skis have a nearly straight-line geometry. By contrast, carving skis (see
ﬁgure 1) have a manifestly nonvanishing sidecut1. Typical carving skis have a sidecut radius on the
order of 16 m at a chord length of 170 cm. However, parameters used in various models may be adapted
to the intended application: e.g., models designed for less narrow curves may have a sidecut-radius
RSC of about 19.5 m at a length of 180 cm. Skis suited for very narrow slalom curves have an RSC of
about 14.5 m at a length of up to 164 cm. A typical version suited for oﬀ-piste freestyle skiing features
a typical length of 185 cm at a sidecut radius of 25.3 m.

The sidecut has been introduced ﬁrst into the world of snow-related leisure activity by the snowboard
where the wider proﬁle of the instrument allowed for a realization of a rather marked sidecut without
stringent demands on the materials used. The carved turn is the preferred turning procedure on a
snowboard. Skidding should be avoided in competitions as far as possible because it necessarily entails
frictional losses. In practical situations, carving skiers and snowboarders may realize astonishingly
high tilt angles φ in the range of [60o, 80o] (the “tilt angle” is the angle of line joining the board
and the center-of-mass of the skier or boarder with the normal to the surface of the ski slope). In
snowboarding, the transition from a right to a left turn is then often executed by jumping, with the
idea of “glueing together” the trajectories of two perfect carved turns, again avoiding frictional losses.
The sidecut radius RSC of a snowboard may assume values as low as 6–8 m at a typical chord length
between 150 cm and 160 cm.

This paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we proceeds toward the derivation of the “ideal-carving
equation”, which involves rather elementary considerations that we choose to present in some detail,
1Materials used in the construction of carving skis have to fulﬁll rather high demands because the strongest forces
act on the narrowest portion of the ski. Yet at the same time, undesired vibrations of the shovel and tail of the ski have
to be avoided, so that the materials have to be rigid enough to press both shovel and tail ﬁrmly onto the snow and
absorb as well the strong lateral forces exerted during turns.

for clarity. The geometry of sidecut radius is discussed in section 2.1, and we then proceed from the the
simplest case of the forces acting along a trajectory perpendicular to the fall line (section 2.2) to more
general situations (section 2.3). The projection of the forces in directions parallel and perpendicular
to the skier’s trajectory lead to the concept of “eﬀective weight” (section 2.4). The inclusion of a
In section 3,
centrifugal force acting in a curve allows us to generalize this concept (section 2.5).
we discuss the “ideal-carving equation”, including applications. The actual derivation of the “ideal-
carving equation” in section 3.1 is an easy exercise, in view of the preparations made in section 2.
An alternative form of this equation has already appeared in [1]; in the current article we try to
reformulate the equation in a form which we deem to be more suitable for practical applications. The
consequences which follow from the “ideal-carving equation” are discussed in section 3.2. Finally, we
mention some implications for the design of skis and boards in section 4.

According to ﬁgure 1, the smooth curve described by the edge of a carving has the approximate form

A typical carving ski with a chord length of 160 cm may have a sidecut radius as low as RSC = 14.
Estimating the contact length to be about 80 % of the chord length, we arrive at d
1.8 cm. The
maximum width of a ski (reached at the end of the contact curve) is of the order of 10 cm, so that a
sidecut of about 1.8 cm will lead to a minimum width which is roughly two thirds of the maximum
width. This puts high demands on the material.
A typical snowboard has a length of about 168 cm and a width of about 25 cm. The contact length is
about 125 cm. A sidecut of

results, which means that for a typical snowboard, the relative diﬀerence of the minimum width to
the maximum width is only 20 %. This does not put as high a demand on the material as is the case
for a carving ski.
As the ski describes a carved turn, which is executed on the edge of the ski, the radius of curvature

2.2 Trajectory Perpendicular to the Fall Line

The angle of inclination of the ski slope against the horizontal is denoted as α. Unless the ski slope is
[0o, 900]. We assume the skier trajectory to be exactly horizontal. The work
overhanging, we have α
done by the gravitational force vanishes, and the skier, under ideal conditions, neither decelerates nor
accelerates.

Figure 2: The skiing trajectory is indicated as parallel to a horizontal that lies in the plane
described by the ski slope. That plane, in turn, is inclined against the horizontal by an
angle α. The force exerted on the skier in the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth is W . It may
be decomposed into a component FN perpendicular to the plane described by the ski slope,
and a component FS lying in the plane of the slope.

2.3 More General Case

In a more general case, the angle of the skier’s trajectory with the horizontal is denoted β
= 0. Within
a right curve, β varies from 0o to 180o, whereas within a left-hand curve, β varies from an initial value
of 180o to a ﬁnal value of 0o. The elementary geometrical considerations follow from ﬁgure 3.

Figure 3: This ﬁgure illustrates vector decomposition in a more general case. The skier’s
trajectory describes an angle β with the horizontal and is explicitly indicated in the ﬁgure
by the straight line parallel to FP. The force FS, which is acting inside the slope plane, is
decomposed into a lateral force Flat and a force FP which is parallel to the skier’s trajectory
and leads to an acceleration. Of course, the force FN is perpendicular to the slope.

FP, and

For a skier’s trajectory directly in the fall line, we have β = 90o, Flat = 0 and FS = FP, resulting
in maximal acceleration along the fall line. Let ˆf be a unit vector tangent to the skier’s trajectory,
i.e. ˆf
= 1. The direction of FP is as given in ﬁgure 3. An analytic expression for ˆf
can easily be obtained by starting from the unit vector ˆx that points in the x-direction as given in
ﬁgure 3. We ﬁrst rotate ˆx about the z-axis by an angle
β. The result of this operation is denoted
as the vector ˆi. A further rotation about the x-axis by an angle +α leads to the vector ˆf (this last
step is a clockwise rotation about the negative x-axis by an angle α).
A rotation of ˆx by
α, which “rotates ˆi into the ski slope”, is expressed as a rotation matrix,

sin β, 0). The rotation of ˆi about the x-axis by an angle

β leads to ˆi = (cos β,

2.4 Eﬀective Weight

We have the decomposition of the gravitational force W = FN + Flat + FP. The force FP simply
accelerates the skier. The force Fload = FN + Flat therefore has to be compensated by the snow.
Therefore, to avoid slippage, the skier should balance her/his weight in such a way that his/her
center-of-mass is joined with the ski along a straight line parallel to the eﬀective weight Fload,

Figure 4: The skier’s trajectory is as indicated in ﬁgure 3. The eﬀective weight of the skier
is Fload. We remember that FN is perpendicular to the ski slope. In order to avoid slippage,
the line joining the ski boots and the skier’s center-of-mass must be parallel to Fload. The
tilt angle of the skier with the normal to the ski slope is denoted φ.

[0o, 90o].
We call φ the angle of inclination or tilt angle. Unless the skier falls into the snow, φ

2.5 Forces Acting in a Curve

Until now, we only have a very limited model describing descent along a straight line in the plane
of the ski slope. To see what happens when the skier makes a turn, let us have a look at the forces
again. In a turn, the centrifugal inertial force FC,

total radial force, which we name FLAT in order to diﬀerentiate it from Flat. In the second (“lower”)
half of a left as well as in the second (“lower”) half of a right curve, the centrifugal force is parallel
to the lateral force, and the positive sign prevails in equation (20). By contrast, in the upper half of
either a curve, the centrifugal force is antiparallel to the lateral force, and the negative sign should be
chosen. We have (see equations (8), (10) and 14))

Its modulus depends on whether Flat is parallel or antiparallel to the centrifugal force,

For the centrifugal force to act as shown in the ﬁgure, the skier’s trajectory is required to
describe a left-hand curve, as displayed.

3 The Ideal–Carving Equation

3.1 Derivation

Up to this point we have mainly followed the discussion outlined on pp. 76–104 and pp. 208–215
of [1]. Under the assumption of a perfect carved turn, the instantaneous curvature radius R, which is
determined by the bent edges of the ski, depends on the sidecut radius RSC and on the tilt angle Φ
as follows (see equation (6)),

R(Φ) = RSC cos Φ .
(28)
However, the assumption of a carved turn requires that the eﬀective weight FLOAD be acting along
the straight line joining the ski boots and the center-of-mass of the skier. This means that the angle
Φ also has to fulﬁll the equation (25) which we specialize to the case (27) in the sequel, and reiterate

In view of (28), we have

The variables of the ideal-carving equation are the velocity v of the skier, the angle β of the trajectory
of the skier with the horizontal, and the instantaneous curvature radius R of the skier’s trajectory. The

radius RSC of the ski. Under appropriate substitutions, this equation is equivalent to equation (T5.3)
on p. 209 of [1], but as we hope of a somewhat more useful form than the alternative formulation
discussed in [1], mainly because the tilt angle is eliminated from the equation.
Alternatively speaking, the ideal-carving equation deﬁnes a function

so that the equation

deﬁnes the “ideal-carving surface” as a 2-dimensional submanifold of a three-dimensional space spanned
by v, R, and β.
Likewise, we may consider the ideal-gas equation

f (v, R, β) = 0

p V = N k T

where p is the pressure, V denotes the volume, N the number of atoms, k the Boltzmann constant,
and T the absolute temperature. The ideal-gas equation may be rewritten as follows,

The equation F (p, V, T ) = 0 then deﬁnes a two-dimensional manifold embedded in R
the ideal-gas equation entails the idealization of perfect thermodynamic equilibrium, yet in realistic
processes a gas volume will not always be in such a state. Nevertheless, in order to avoid sub-optimal
performance within a Carnot-like process, or by analogy in order to avoid frictional losses when skiing,
one may strive to keep the system as close to equilibrium as possible at all stages during the process.

3.2 Graphical Representation

The solutions of (32) deﬁne a two-dimensional submanifold of R×R×
deﬁned by equation (32b) is represented for the parameter combination RSC = 16 m, g = 9.81 m/s2,
and α = 15o.
In particular, we see that maintaining the ideal-
Figure 6 gives us rather important information.
carving condition while going through a curve of constant radius of curvature, within the interval
β = 0o to β = 180o, implies a lowering of the skier’s speed during the trajectory. This is possible only
if the frictional force, antiparallel to FP, provides for suﬃcient deceleration. Of course, under ideal
racing conditions the skier will accelerate rather than decelerate during her/his descent.
Acceleration during a turn is compatible with the ideal carving condition only if the instantaneous
radius of curvature signiﬁcantly decreases during the turn. This corresponds to a turn in which the
skier starts oﬀ with what seems to be a very wide turn, gradually making the turn more tight during
his/her descent. The pattern generated is that of the letter “J.” The practical necessities of world-cup
racing prevent such trajectories. Typical tilt angles are too high, and typical centrifugal forces too
large to be sustainable in practice on the idealized trajectories. This is why we see snow spraying even
in highly optimized world-cup slalom and giant slalom skiing.
However, there is yet another very important restriction to the possibility of maintaining ideal-carving
conditions at all times: From ﬁgures 6 and 7, we see that the velocity v actually decreases with
increasing radius of curvature, β begin constant. This means that the highest velocity compatible
with ideal-carving conditions is attained at very tight turns R
0. The tilt angle Φ would approach
values close to 90o in this case, because

conditions if the skier’s velocity considerably exceeds the limiting velocity

We investigate this question in more detail. For given R, the maximum v is attained for β = 0 because
in this case, the centrifugal force is most eﬀectively compensated by the lateral force Flat. In this case,

horizontal. This equation determines an ideal-carving manifold whose properties have been discussed
in section 3.2, with graphical representations for typical parameters to be found in ﬁgures 6—9. In
particular, the limiting velocity vlimit as given in equation (36) indicates an ideal operational velocity
of a carving ski as a function of the angle of inclination of the ski slope and of the sidecut radius.

indicated. However, the velocity range of ﬁgure 9 is well within the typical values attained in world-
cup slalom races. It is therefore evident that carving skis are well suited for such races, in theory as
well as in practice. We immediately learn from ﬁgure 9 that a slalom with tight turns, which implies
a rather slow operational velocity due to the necessity of changing the trajectory within the reaction
time of a human being, demands slalom skis with a smaller sidecut radius than those suited for a
rather ﬂat slope and wide turns. Note that a smaller sidecut radius implies a larger actual sidecut d

typical inclinations of the ski slope α. For velocities appreciably beyond vlimit,

according to equation (3). It may well be beneﬁcial for a slalom skier to have a look at the actual
course, and to measure the average steepness of the slope, and to choose an appropriate ski from a
given selection, before starting her/his race.

We will now discuss possible further improvements in the design of carving skis. To this end we draw
an analogy to the steering of a bicycle going down an inclined surface. The driver is supposed not to
exert any force via the action of the pedals of the bicycle. Indeed, during the ride on a bicycle, the
driver can maintain ideal-“carving” conditions under rather general circumstances, avoiding slippage.
One might wonder why a bicycle driver can accomplish this while a carving skier or snowboarder
cannot. The reason is the following: Equation (28) deﬁnes a relation between the tilt angle Φ and
the instantaneous radius of curvature R. When riding a bicycle, one may freely adjust the relation
between Φ and R by choosing an appropriate position for the steering. On carving skis, the position
of the “steering” is always related uniquely to the tilt angle Φ by equation (28). When going fast on a
bicycle, it is possible to use a small steering angle even if one leans by a large angle toward the center
of the curve. On a carving ski, the “steering angle” automatically becomes large when the tilt angle is
large, resulting in a small radius of curvature. This eﬀect means that a limiting velocity exists beyond
which it is impossible to operate a carving ski under ideal-carving conditions. This is represented by
the equation (36). Beyond this velocity, the non-fulﬁllment of the ideal-carving equation is visible by
spraying snow. By contrast, on a bicycle, it is possible to adjust the steering of the front wheel so
that the radius of curvature as deﬁned by the relative inclination of the front and rear wheels, and
the inclination Φ of the bicycle itself, fulﬁll the ideal-carving equation (31).

How could one construct a carving ski with the possibility of steering? In principle, all that is required

would be an inertial measurement device (see e.g. [2]) that transfers the tilt angle Φ, the velocity of the
skier and the instantaneous radius of curvature R, as well as the angle β and the inclination of the ski
slope to an electronic device. According to equation (31), these variables determine an ideal sidecut
radius RSC which could be adjusted dynamically by a servo motor. In this case, it would be possible
to fulﬁll ideal-carving conditions along the entire trajectory. A ﬁrst step in this direction would be
simpler device that would only measure the inclination of the ski slope α, determining a near-ideal
sidecut radius according to equation (36), possibly with allowance for some correction terms.

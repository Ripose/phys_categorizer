Abstract

Recent numerical work indicates that the classical motion of positronium in a constant magnetic

ﬁeld does not exhibit chaotic behavior if the system is conﬁned to two dimensions. One would

therefore expect this system to possess a second constant of the motion in addition to the total

energy. In this paper we construct a generalization of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector and show

that a component of this vector is a constant of the motion.

Anderson, Murawski, and Schmidt[1] have recently performed a numerical study of the

classical motion of positronium embedded in a constant magnetic ﬁeld. They ﬁnd that the

three-dimensional system is chaotic, suggesting the possibility of a chaos-assisted tunneling

reduction of the lifetime of positronium which Ackermann, Shertzer, and Schmelcher[2, 3]

had previously predicted to be on the order of years. When the system is conﬁned to two

dimensions, however, no sign of chaos emerges from their computations. Indeed, they were

able to show that the largest Lyapunov exponent is zero. These results suggest the existence

of an additional constant of the motion (CM). We show here that such a CM may be obtained

from a component of a generalized Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector[4, 5, 6].

For completeness, we review the basic equations in the notation of Ref.[1]. The system

consists of two particles of equal mass m and charges +e and −e moving nonrelativistically

in a constant magnetic ﬁeld B:

m ¨r1 = e ˙r1 × B −

m ¨r2 = −e ˙r2 × B +

One may easily integrate the sum of Eqs. (1) and (2) to ﬁnd the conserved quantity

(called the pseudomomentum in Refs.[2, 3])

where

m ˙R − e r × B = α

R = r1 + r2

r = r1 − r2

The diﬀerence of Eqs. (1) and (2) leads to

Choosing the coordinate system such that B = Be3 and rescaling t and r according to

where β = (2πǫ0/me3B)1/3α × e3.

In the two-dimensional case, (r × e3) × e3 = −r, and the above simpliﬁes to

The presence of the harmonic term on the right-hand side makes ionization impossible for

two-dimensional positronium.

Eq. (9) implies that the dimensionless angular momentum L = r × ˙r is not conserved.

Indeed, taking the cross product of r with Eq. (9) we have

¨r = −r −

A second nontrivial CM may be obtained by taking the cross product of Eq. (11) with ˙r,

and then computing the scalar product of the resulting equation with β. After taking this

cross product, adding and subtracting L × ¨r on the left-hand side, and using Eq. (9) we get

But L × r/r3 = dˆr/dt, where ˆr = r/r is the unit vector in the r/r direction. Therefore

Thus

The existence of the new CM Cβ = C · β depends crucially on the equality of the

masses of the particles involved; it no longer obtains if m1 6= m2. Furthermore, it is an

exact conservation law for the classical dynamics of two-dimensional positronium only if the

experimental conditions warrant modeling the real system by Eqs. (1), (2), i.e., only if the

conditions are such that spin, radiative, and relativistic eﬀects are irrelevant. On the other

hand, such eﬀects are expected to be small for the delocalized states of interest in Refs.[2, 3].

Hence, even if the improved (by the inclusion of spin, radiative, and relativistic eﬀects)

description did display chaotic behavior, Eq.

(16) should still represent an approximate

conservation law, implying that the predictions of Refs.[2, 3] would not be threatened by

chaos-assisted tunneling in the two-dimensional case.

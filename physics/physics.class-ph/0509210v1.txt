Abstract

An almost brief, though lengthy, review introduction about the long
history of higher order gravities and their applications, as employed in
the literature, is provided. We review the analogous procedure between
higher order gravities and GR, as described in our previous works, in
order to highlight its important achievements. Amongst which are pre-
sentation of an easy classiﬁcation of higher order Lagrangians and its
employment as a criteria in order to distinguish correct metric theories
of gravity. For example, it does not permit the inclusion of only one of
the second order Lagrangians in isolation. But, it does allow the inclu-
sion of the cosmological term. We also discuss on the compatibility of
our procedure and the Mach idea. We derive a dimensional dependent
version of Duﬀ’s trace anomaly relation, which in four -dimension is the
same as the usual Duﬀ relation. The Lanczos Lagrangian satisﬁes this
new constraint in any dimension. The square of the Weyl tensor iden-
tically satisﬁes it independent of dimension, however, this Lagrangian
satisﬁes the previous relation only in three and four dimensions.

1 Higher Order Gravity Review

The principle of general invariance imposes that the action integral for
gravity must be an invariant quantity, indeed, the profound implications of
this state of aﬀairs are due to Hilbert [1] who was ﬁrst to employ the neces-
sity of the general invariance of all physical laws to the variational principle.

Then, the use of the action principle and the principle of general invariance
allow an immediate connection between symmetry principles and conser-
vation laws to be established as inner identities. Yet, change of dynamics
can mainly be achieved by altering Lagrangian of a system, as in general
relativity (GR) the physical requirements which should be satisﬁed by any
reasonable Lagrangian formulation of gravitational interactions are still an
open subject for discussion.

Among scalar Lagrangians, ﬁeld equations based on a Lagrangian quadratic

in the curvature tensor have had a long history in the theory of gravitation.
These theories occur for various reasons in diﬀerent areas of theoretical
physics. Though, they have taken much more attraction in the last two
decades when they have been proposed mainly to solve some problems in
the quantization of gravity. But, the ﬁrst idea dates back to the early days
of GR in the work by Weyl [2] and Eddington [3] in an attempt to unify
gravity with electromagnetism, however this approach was unfruitful [4, 5].
Then, Bach [6] and Lanczos [7] considered actions that are made up
only by the quadratic terms in the curvature in four dimensions as scale-
invariance, due to Weyl’s idea of the principle of gauge-invariance under
conformal transformations for when the conformal factor is a constant, e.g.
g d4x. However, this idea has
they studied the dimensionless action
also been strongly criticized as a nonviable theory [8]. The two main objec-
R
tions against these Lagrangians are as the metric based on them does not
satisfy the ﬂat space limit at asymptotically large distances, and disagree-
ment with observations follows when the matter is incorporated.

Since these early suggestions, work in this area was not very active,
although some results were obtained before it ﬂourished in the seventies,
i.e. after suggestions made from considering the quantization of GR in the
sixties.

Perhaps a legitimate mathematical motivation to examine gravitational
theories built on non-linear Lagrangians has been the phenomenological
character of Einstein’s theory which leaves room for such amendments, i.e.
the dependence of the Einstein tensor/Lagrangian on the derivatives of the
metric and the dimension. Actually, the Einstein Lagrangian is not the
most general second order Lagrangian allowed by the principle of general
invariance, and indeed, through this principle the latter generalization can
be performed up to any order, and a general scalar Lagrangian is a higher
derivative Lagrangian.

However, Einstein’s gravitational theory has proven to be a successful
theory in “real” physical phenomena, e.g. in the “weak” gravitational ﬁeld,
and its main diﬃculties become manifest only when the curvature of space-
time is not negligible. Actually, the curvature is noticeable on very small
scales, and this is particularly relevant to the very early universe. In an-
other words, at really small distances, of the order of Planck’s length, an
Euclidean topological structure is quite unlikely. At such distances, even

2

the ﬂuctuations of quantum gravitation will be extremely violent and prob-
ably produce an ever changing, dynamic topology [9]. Thus, it perhaps
allows Lagrangians extended beyond the Einstein–Hilbert Lagrangian to be
considered as alternative theories.

On the other hand, the unity of physics during its development must be
maintained by the correspondence principle. That is, in every “new” phys-
ical theory the “previous” one is contained as a “limiting” case. As men-
tioned before, gravitational theories based on a Lagrangian which is only
purely quadratic in the curvature tensor have been strongly criticized [8] as
nonviable theories. However, a gravitational theory has to not only correctly
reﬂect the dynamical behavior of the whole universe, but also be valid for
stellar evolution. Therefore, one should demand that GR must be main-
tained as a “limiting” case of non-linear gravitational theories.

≥

Evidently, the uniﬁcation programs in particle physics seem to demand
1015 GeV , in order to
energies of the order of cosmological energies, E
be veriﬁed, and thus the very early universe may provide the only place
to test these ideas. Hence, the standard prejudices about the strength of
quantum eﬀects on gravitational interaction imply that they should not be
appreciable unless the distances involved in the problem are very small,
of the order of Planck’s length. So, the questions of quantum gravity are
naturally connected with the very early universe cosmology [10]. That is,
these eﬀects should be completely negligible in the “limiting” case of non-
linear gravitational Lagrangians, i.e.

It is believed that higher order Lagrangians play an essential rˆole for
supergravity approach [11]. Nowadays, it is also well known1 that Ein-
stein’s gravity when treated as a fundamental quantum gravity leads to a
non-renormalizable theory, although, these diﬃculties become manifest only
when the curvature of space-time is not negligible. In order to permit renor-
malization of the divergences, quantum gravity in curved space-time has
indicated that the Einstein–Hilbert action should be enlarged by the inclu-
sion of higher order curvature counter terms [13]. In fact, it has been shown1
that the Lagrangian2

which has the required Newtonian limit and, by the Gauss–Bonnet theo-
rem (relation) [14], is the most general quadratic Lagrangian in (and up to)
four dimensions, solves the renormalization problem and is multiplicatively
renormalizable [15] and asymptotically free [16]. However, it is not uni-
tary within usual perturbation theory [4]. The analysis of quantum theory
revealed [15] that the particle spectrum of the Lagrangian (1), in general,

massive spin-two particle (i.e. ghost) and a massive scalar (spin-zero) parti-
cle, with a total of eight degrees of freedom. In the limit β
0, the spin-two
ghost disappears, however, the divergence problems in the quantum theory
reappear [4].

→

The inclusion of higher order Lagrangian terms have also appeared in
the eﬀect of string theory on classical gravitational physics by means of a
low energy eﬀective action which expresses gravity at the classical level [17].
This eﬀective action in general gives rise to fourth order ﬁeld equations (and
brings in ghosts), and in particular cases, i.e. in the form of dimensionally
continued Gauss–Bonnet densities, it is exactly the Lovelock terms3 (and
consequently no ghosts arise) [21]. However, Duﬀ et al [22] claimed that the
quadratic contribution to the low energy eﬀective Lagrangians for the closed
4 Rµν Rµν + 2 Rαβµν Rαβµν , for the Type
bosonic string is of the form R2
4 Rµν Rµν and only for the E8 ×
II is of the form R2
E8 heterotic string
do form the Gauss–Bonnet combination. The latter term appears naturally
in the next-to-leading order term of the heterotic string eﬀective action and
also plays an essential role in the Chern–Simons gravitational theories [23].

Incidentally, recent argument in [24] shows that 1

also follows from certain compactiﬁcation schemes of string/M–theory.

Though, higher derivative terms are often added as a correction to the
ordinary, lower derivative, theory of gravity, but these terms do not only
mean that they will perturb the original theory. Actually, their presence,
as unconstrained terms even with small coeﬃcients, make the new theory
completely diﬀerent from the original one [25].

Besides, there has been much attraction in considering gravity in higher
dimensional space-time. In this context, one may also use a consistent the-
ory of gravity with a more general action, e.g. the Einstein–Hilbert action
plus higher order terms. Indeed, the above ghost-free property, and the fact
that the Lovelock Lagrangian is the most general second order Lagrangian
which, the same as the Einstein Lagrangian, yields the ﬁeld equations as sec-

ond order equations, have stimulated interests in the Lovelock gravity and
its applications. A considerable amount of work has been done in this area,
especially in the eighties, and perhaps, the greatest number of applications
are performed in cosmology [26], amongst which are approaches to inﬂation-
ary scenarios.4 Recent attraction engages it with the brane cosmology and
the cosmic acceleration [30, 31].

Actually, the observation of high red-shift supernova [32] and the mea-
surement of angular ﬂuctuations of cosmic microwave background ﬂuctua-
tions [33] have separately, though the former directly and the latter indi-
rectly, established that the universe expands with acceleration, instead of
deceleration, at the present epoch. Henceforth, as an alternative approach
to the vacuum energy (the cosmological constant) and/or additional scalar
ﬁeld (quintessence), modiﬁcations of gravity itself with diﬀerent terms of
higher order gravity have recently come into consideration [31, 34, 35]. How-
ever, the 1
R term modiﬁcation has been shown to lead to instabilities [36].
Though, Ref. [37] claims that further modiﬁcation of this modiﬁed gravity
by R2 or other higher order terms may resolve the instabilities, or perhaps
make them avoidable [35, 38].

Lovelock–Cartan gravity [39] and Palatini’s device [40] for non-linear La-
grangians have been considered as well, though, Buchdahl [41] has claimed
the mutual in-equivalence of H-variation and P-variation, and has illus-
trated this for quadratic Lagrangians as an example. However, it has been
shown [42] that the latter Lagrangian still satisﬁes Birkhoﬀ’s theorem. For
recent work on this issue, see Refs. [43].

Non-linear Lagrangians are also proposed in the context of relativistic
cosmology in order to avoid the appearance of some of the singularities
typically encountered for solutions of GR.5

Because of the higher order and greater degree of the non-linearity of
the ﬁeld equations, it is very diﬃcult to ﬁnd out non-trivial exact analytical
solutions of Einstein’s equation with higher order terms, and hence, extract
physical predictions from them, especially that the present technology hardly
may provide empirical checks on these predictions. Though, the Newtonian
limit of fourth [4, 45] and higher [46] order gravities are described by a
Newtonian plus Yukawa term potential, for recent work on this issue see
Refs. [47]. The Cauchy problem for the fourth order ﬁeld equations deriving
from R + α R2 is essentially reducible to a second order one [48] and its
energy is a positive deﬁnite quantity [49]. The positive energy theorem has
also been shown to hold for a larger class of non-linear Lagrangians for which
the Einstein frame can be deﬁned around ﬂat space [50].

In general, the reduction of non-linear purely metric Lagrangian theories
of gravity to a second order form, as equivalent theories to GR plus addi-

tional matter ﬁelds, so-called “dynamical universality” of Einstein’s grav-
ity, under conformal/Legendre like transformations, has been discussed in
the literature, see, e.g., Refs. [51] and references therein. Although, it has
raised a question on the real physical metric [52], where, in reply [53], com-
ments are in having the dynamical equivalence of non-singular conformal
transformations where then, the systems are isomorphic, and not having
necessarily the physical equivalence. Also, the dynamical equivalence of ar-
bitrary high order extended theories of gravity with scalar–tensor gravity,
which claims to be conformally equivalent to GR plus scalar ﬁelds, has been
considered [45, 54, 55]. More discussion about physical equivalence of non-
linear gravity theories, based on the physical features of energy, has been
presented in Ref. [50].

Some static black hole solutions of the Gauss–Bonnet gravity have been
obtained in [56]. And equations governing relativistic ﬂuid dynamics for
quadratic theories and f (R) theories of gravity have been also worked out [57].
Yet, very vast amount of work has been done in the higher order grav-
ities and the references given in this article are not obviously a complete
bibliography on this issue. Actually, this section is almost brief, though
lengthy, review introduction about the long history of higher order gravities
and their applications. In the next section, we will introduce what we have
achieved on this subject.

Introduction

Getting interested in higher order gravities, we have noticed that the
mathematical form of the Einstein tensor, i.e. the splitting feature of it into
the Ricci tensor and the curvature scalar with the trace relation between
them is also a common remarkable properties of each homogeneous term
in the Lovelock tensor,6 but not true for the whole Lovelock tensor.
In
our previous work [58], we demanded an analogy that this common feature
should also be valid for the Lovelock tensor itself, i.e.
ℜ
with T race
, or generally, for any inhomogeneous Euler–Lagrange
expression constructed linearly in terms of homogeneous terms. Indeed, we
did this via deﬁning a generalized trace operator, that we denoted by T race.7
Then, we took [59] the above analogy further for the alternative form of
the Lovelock equation to be the same as the appearance of the alternative

form of the Einstein equation. Hence, we found that the price for this anal-
ogy is to accept the existence of the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum
tensor even in classical treatments. That is, we have actually stated a clas-
sical view of gravitation which explicitly shows the presence of an extra
(anomalous) trace for the energy-momentum tensor, with an indication of
the constitution of the higher order gravities towards this trace anomaly,
exactly as what has been veriﬁed in the quantum aspects of gravity [60].

As an example, we employed [59] this analogy to any generic, the most

As mentioned, the homogeneity is taken with respect to the metric and its derivatives,
without loss of generality, with the homogeneity degree number (HDN) conventions of
[+1]gµν and [+1]gµν
,α. Hence, one can relate the orders n in any Lagrangian, as in L(n),
that represents its HDN. See Ref. [58] for details.

8The a1, a2 and a3 are arbitrary dimensionless constants, and obviously, in three and
four dimensions, only two of these three terms are eﬀective. And in two dimensions, only
one term survives.

which, in the process of re-examining the Weyl anomaly’s applications, was
also suggested by Duﬀ [61] in any dimension.

n trace R(n)

Note that, as a homogeneous Euler–Lagrange expression has a uniform
HDN, then one can work with the usual trace instead of the Trace operator,
and obtains the same results if one demands the appropriate “trace” relation,
i.e. 1
generic. Though, the notion of Trace operator was
introduced as to be able to deal with when one considers the Einstein–Hilbert
Lagrangian plus higher order terms as a complete gravitational Lagrangian,
i.e. when one works with an inhomogeneous Lagrangian constructed linearly
in terms of homogeneous terms.

(generic)αβ = R(n)

One may conclude that the appearance of trace anomaly maybe in-
terpreted as Lovelock modiﬁcation of gravity even in classical treatments.
Though, the above consistency condition has also been derived [62] based
on a cohomological point of view, using the Wess–Zumino consistency con-
ditions, which was claimed to be the true reason for the existence of such
a relation. It has also recently been claimed that the AdS/CFT correspon-
dence, namely the holographic conformal anomaly, maybe responsible for it,
see e.g. Ref. [63] and references therein.

which it completes the trace anomaly relation suggested by Duﬀ [61]. How-
ever, the calculations by most authors conﬁrmed [61] the constraint (10) for
the values of a1, a2 and a3 in all cases, but not always that of γ. Apparently,
this is due to the fact that the term R is a local anomaly [61].

Actually, in the semi-classical approach of quantum gravity theory em-
ployed to deduce the trace anomalies, the eﬀective action is [65] a covariant
functional i.e., invariant under diﬀeomorphisms and local gauge transforma-
tions. Therefore, the approximation procedures for calculating the eﬀective
action have to preserve the general covariance at each order. Hence, confor-
mal invariance is also sacriﬁced to the needs of general covariance, i.e. the
Weyl conformal invariance is not a good symmetry beyond the classical level.
This is what we have also performed in the classical theory of gravitation
through preserving the covariant property of the linear Lagrangian theory
of Einstein’s gravity for each order of non-linear theories of gravitation, by
an analogous demand.

Hence, the origin of Duﬀ’s suggested relation between the coeﬃcients
of the conformal anomalies may classically be interpreted due to the gen-
eral covariance of Einstein’s theory as applied to the second order of the
Lovelock modiﬁcation of gravity. Though, it is somehow a naive conjecture,
nevertheless, it gives almost an easy classical procedure to grasp the de-
sired result, which, (perhaps) besides what have already been given in the
literature [62, 63], may indicate of an intrinsic property behind it.

In this article, ﬁrst in the following section, in order to present a better
view of the analogy/approach that we have employed, we will summarize
its important achievements, which mainly have not been highlighted before.
Then, in Section 4, based on this analogy, we will derive a dimensional
dependent version of Duﬀ’s suggested relation.

3 Remarks

In this section, we will outline what mainly have been gained in the
above mentioned analogous procedure till now, which have not been em-
phasized or mentioned in our previous works. Aimed to show, as a main
advantage, that this analogous of the Einstein tensor can be employed as a
criteria in order to distinguish correct/legitimate metric theories of gravity,
which are either homogeneous functions or linear combinations of diﬀerent
homogeneous functions of the metric and its derivatives.

These remarks are as follows:

•

If one allows scalar Lagrangian to be up to the kth order jet-prolongation
2, there would be a lot of Lagrangian choices
of the metric, with k
that can be considered. For example, higher-loop quantum correc-
tions to GR are expected to contain terms of the type R kR in the

Lagrangian [55, 66]. That is, the gravitational theory with the La-
grangian

κ2

(cid:16)

Xk=0
where p is a positive integer and ak’s are constants of the order of
(Planck’s) length to the power 2k + 2. The above Lagrangian is up
to (2p + 2)th order jet-prolongation of the metric which leads to the
gravitational ﬁeld equations of order 2p + 4. For p = 1, the Lagrangian
is

(cid:17)

L =

κ2

R + a0 R2 + a1 R R
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

(17)

which is known [55] as sixth order gravity in the literature, i.e. it leads
0 and
to sixth order ﬁeld equations, and wherein one should set a0 ≥
a1 < 0 in order to exclude tachyons [29].

Now, a point is that: the HDN provides an easy procedure to classify
diﬀerent Lagrangian terms, especially higher order Lagrangians.

For example, in order to amend the Lagrangian of sixth order gravity,
Berkin et al [27] discussed that the Lagrangian term of R R is a
two
third order Lagrangian based on the dimensionality scale, i.e.
derivatives are dimensionally equivalent to one Riemann–Christoﬀel
tensor or any one of its contractions. However, it can be better justiﬁed
on account of the above regard, since it has the HDN three [58]. As,
in order to generalize Lagrangian (17), the following Lagrangian has
also been considered in the literature [27, 29]

The higher order terms become increasingly complex, e.g.
expression for the fourth order of the Lovelock Lagrangian which are

The second term of the Lovelock Lagrangian, the Gauss–Bonnet term,
does indeed satisfy the condition (10).
In another words, the coef-
ﬁcients used in the Lanczos Lagrangian are speciﬁc to a equivalence
class of any generic second order Lagrangians accepting our analogous
demand.

which can only be zero when the dimension of space-time is either

The condition (10) does not permit the inclusion of only one of the
second order Lagrangians in isolation, as mentioned before, diﬃculties
also exist in quantum gravity when only one of these second order
terms is considered [4, 15].

•

As the most general quadratic Lagrangian in (and up to) four dimen-
sions is (1), the condition (10) reads

3 α + β = 0 ,

(24)

•

•

where α and β are arbitrary non-zero constants.

In this case, the particle spectrum in the quantum theory does not
contain the scalar particle, though this does not help the unitarity
problems [4].

In two dimensions, as Rαβµν Rαβµν = 2Rµν Rµν = R2, there is only
one independent second order Lagrangian that can be considered as a
higher derivative term [72]. However, condition (10) does not allow it,
just as one cannot have Einstein’s Lagrangian term in two dimensional
space-time either and other options have been sought [73].

To enquire about the cosmological term, let us investigate the analogy
for this as well. Consistent with the aspect of equations (2) and (4)
2Λ/κ2, a
for the n = 0 case (zero HDN), the Lagrangian c0 L(0)
constant, produces the cosmological term, G(0)
Λ gµν , in the ﬁeld
equations. Hence, the exception value of the HDN in our deﬁnition
of generalized trace,12 equation (5), maybe related to the cosmolog-
ical term diﬃculty. Nevertheless, with our choice of deﬁnition for
the generalized trace, we have T race [+1]gµν = trace gµν = D and
T race [−1]gµν = trace gµν = D, as though the dimension of space-time
has not been altered.

Stachel [74] has pointed out that what went wrong in the last con-
clusion of the so-called Einstein’s “hole” argument was that the point
events of the space-time manifold had been incorrectly thought of as

individuated independently of the ﬁeld itself. That is, it is impossible
to drag the metric ﬁeld away from a physical point in empty space-
time and leave that physical point behind. Actually, Einstein himself
realized [75] this as he wrote to Besso that nothing is physically real
but the totality of space-time point coincidences. Later on, in an ad-
dendum [76] he placed great stress on the inseparability of the metric
and the manifold.

Besides, according to the Aristotelian view [77], space is a plenum, i.e.
it is inseparably associated with the material substance, and not a void.
Hence, the properties of space are not independent of the material
bodies that move in it. Just as it is well known that, even though
in Newtonian physics, space is a pre-existing stage on which material
particles are the characters acting out the drama of physical events,
but, in relativistic gravitational physics, space cannot be considered
apart from the matter that is in it. And, as the mathematician E.
Whittaker points out, the characters create the stage as they walk
about on it [77]. Hence, the properties of space-time in gravitational
theories must be inseparable from the matter that is in it.

On the other hand, though the main critique of Mach and Einstein
to absolute space, that it acts on everything but is not aﬀected by
anything, is not applied to GR, but, actually, according to the Mach
idea, the question would be whether matter just modiﬁes an already
existing space-time structure, or whether it is the only source for its
structure [78]. The former, a weaker version of Mach’s principle, is
in agreement with Einstein’s gravitational theory. But, the latter,
a strong version of Mach’s principle in the sense that for a universe
devoid of matter there should be no meaning for the existence of space-
time [78], is not consistent with it for it has speciﬁed structures in the
absence of matter.13 So that, the space-time of GR still itself has some
essence independent of matter.

2 )R = 1

The link to this issue, in our opinion, could be the relation between T
2 κ2 T , and the basic concept
and R as in T race Gαβ = (1
of matter. For example, a similar behavior, as R vanishes whenever
Tαβ vanishes, should also be sought for the higher order terms . This
is somehow a procedure that it may indicate a more compatibility be-
tween GR and the strong version of the Mach idea [80]. In another
words, we adopt the view for establishing the generality of the known
proposals, namely, that geometrical curvature induces matter [81], ge-
ometrical description of physical forces, and geometrical origin for the
matter content of the universe. As the idea, more or less in this connec-
tion, that associates extra dimensions with the intrinsic characteristics

13See, for example Ref. [79].

of matter, e.g. [82], or any analytical D dimensional Riemannian mani-
fold can be locally embedded in an (D+1) dimensional ﬂat Riemannian
manifold [83], see Refs. [84] for a more extensive discussion.

Hence, using the analogous demand, we showed [59] that in the cases
where higher order gravities dominate, space-time “behaves” as if
its energy-momentum has been “exchanged” with matter’s energy-
momentum in the sense that in a universe devoid of “matter” there
should be also no meaning for the existence of space-time. Note that,
the applicability of higher order gravitational theories are restricted
by the energy scale. In other words, as the coeﬃcients of higher order
gravities are very small, one cannot detect such implications in “real”
world. However, these eﬀects are important in highly curved areas,
such as the very early universe, or in quantum physics.

As it is evident, the explicit appearance of D gives rise to a dimensional
dependent version of Duﬀ’s trace anomaly relation.

Again, it gives two degrees of freedom, in D > 4, to choose a desired
combination. Also, the constraint (27) only in four dimensions is exactly
the same as the condition (10), where, due to the extra condition of the
Gauss–Bonnet density, leads again in this dimension to the condition (24).
Hence, the constraint has been modiﬁed for higher dimensions. The reason
is obvious, for that one can generally set

where P can be an arbitrary homogeneous function of any order jet-prolongation
of the metric with the HDN two. But, using (6), one gets

And, in order to be equal to R′, D must be four.
In the special case of
(generic)αβ and R(2′)
R(2′)
generic, P is obviously proportional to R. Incidentally,
since the term R is a complete divergence, it gives no contribution to
the variation of the relevant action. Therefore, adding such a term to the
Lagrangian still gives the same result, but it can cover the remaining part
of the trace anomaly (14).

The non-generic combination of the Lanczos Lagrangian satisﬁes the
above constraint in any dimension. Actually, one can write equation (27) as

which shows that the only combination that is independent of dimension is
the combination of the Lanczos Lagrangian.

a1) = 0 ,

(30)

The square of the Weyl conformal tensor, equation (22), identically sat-

isﬁes the condition (27) independent of dimension.

To reiterate, if one considers only one of the second order Lagrangians (7)
in isolation, constraint (27) will set the third coeﬃcient equal to zero as well.
In three dimensions, again because of the extra Gauss–Bonnet relation, the
constraint, for the Lagrangian (1), now reads

In this case, the particle spectrum in the quantum theory should be rechecked [85].
In two dimensions, the constraint gives

where, because of the relation mentioned before, the Lagrangian under con-
sideration actually is (a1 + 1
2 a2 + a3)R2. Hence, the above constraint, in two
dimensions, again conﬁrms the null result of the previous section. But, the
arrangement (25), for the cosmological term, cannot be performed.

Finally, the Euler–Lagrange expression G(2)

(generic)αβ could partially be

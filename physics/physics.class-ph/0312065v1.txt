Point imaging by photonic crystal slab with a triangular lattice of air holes is studied theoretically
in this letter. We have used ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) to demonstrate the negative
refraction phenomenon and study the point imaging by photonic crystal slab. Utilizing the transfer
function, we have also analyzed the imaging quality versus diﬀerent surface termination of photonic
crystal slab. Our results also show that the coupling coeﬃcient at the air-photonic crystal (PC)
interface are strongly angular dependent even when the eﬀective refractive index of PC satisﬁes
nef f = −1.

PACS numbers: 78.20.Ci, 42.70.Qs

Photonic crystals (PCs) are artiﬁcial structures, which
have a periodic arrangement of dielectric or metallic ma-
terials. During the past ten years, PCs have been exten-
sively studied for their unique optical properties [1, 2, 3].
PCs may provide a possibility of forbidding light prop-
agation within a frequency band, i.e., a photonic band
gap. So far, studies of PCs have been focused on this op-
tical band-gap phenomenon, which is of interest for many
optical applications.

Another unconventional and equally important opti-
cal properties of PCs are that they exhibit an ultra-
refraction, superprism eﬀects, and strong dispersion in
some frequency regions. These novel phenomena were
ﬁrstly reported by Lin et al., and they have realized it
experimentally in the millimeter-wave spectral regime[4].
Then, Kosaka et al. demonstrated a highly dispersive
photonic microstructure at optical wavelengths used a
complex three-dimensional (“autocloned”) PC[5]. These
unusual properties present an exciting possibility for
achieving microphotonic and nanophotonic devices that
can focus, disperse, switch, and steer light. For example,
the superprism eﬀect can be applied to light collimating
[6] and a wavelength multi/demuliplexer [7]. Recently, it
is even found that at some frequency regions, PCs can
also refract light as if they have a negative refractive in-
dex [8, 9, 10], which has many potential applications such
as self-focusing or imaging [11, 12].

In the present letter, we will study point imaging in two
dimensional (2D) photonic crystal slab utilizing negative
refraction. We consider a triangular lattice of air holes
in dielectric ǫ = 12.96, with lattice constant a and hole
radius r = 0.4a. Here, we only consider the transverse
magnetic (TM) modes. To investigate the light propa-
gation in PCs, what we ﬁrstly have to do is to calculate

the photonic band structure. The corresponding band
structure of the PC are shown in Fig. 1(a). For the low
frequency (or long wavelength) part, the wave propagat-
ing in the PC does not feel the modulation due to the
periodic structure. For the higher frequencies, propaga-
tion in PC is complicated because it is inﬂuenced by the
modulated band structure. However, Bloch wave (eigen
mode in PC) travel through PC with a deﬁnite prop-
agation direction despite the presence of scattering. To
visualize and analyze light propagation in PCs, equal fre-
quency surface (EFS) in k space of the photonic bands
is introduced, whose gradient vectors give the group ve-
locities of the photonic modes.

Fig. 1(b) shows the EFS plot for the second band at
the frequency between 0.25(a/λ) and 0.34(a/λ) in the
ﬁrst Brillouin zone (Our numerical calculations are car-
ried out by a freely available software package.[13]). The
inner part has a higher frequency. The circle-marked line
and dashed line represent the EFS in PC and in air for
the frequency ω = 0.30(a/λ), respectively. It can be seen
from the EFS that for the higher frequencies the shape of
EFS is almost circular. For this frequency range, we can
deﬁne an eﬀective refractive index from the radius of the
EFS using Snell’s law .[8, 9], which is used to describe
the light refraction in PC. Meanwhile, since the group
velocity for the second photonic band is negative, the di-
rection of energy ﬂow is inward from the circular EFS. To
assure all-angle negative refraction, here we consider the
frequency ω = 0.30(a/λ). For this frequency, the eﬀective
refractive index of PC is
1, based on the Snell’s law. It

should be noted that the behavior in PC for nef f =
quite diﬀerent with that in left-handed material (LHM)

1, no reﬂection will oc-
cur between the air-LHM interface[14]. However, this is

not the case when dealing the problem for case of air-PC
interface even when the eﬀective refractive index of PC
1. For example, the coupling for such a
satisﬁes nef f =
PC is near zero even for normal-incident light when the
surface normal of PC slab is along ΓK direction. The
reason is that the symmetry of plane wave is even while
the bloch wave excited is odd along the normal surface.
For an incident plane waves with diﬀerent angle, Bloch
waves with diﬀerent symmetry in PC will be excited. To
investigate the behavior at the air-PC interface, what we
have to do is to study the coupling for plane-wave (eigen
mode in homogenous materials) and Bloch wave (eigen
mode in PC). In the previous work, what they mainly
considered is how to get the propagation direction in PC
when light hits on PC. They do not put much attention
on how much energy will be coupled into PC. Up to our
knowledge, there is still not given out a systemic and ef-
fective method to study such problem. We will present
an interpretative method for this problem using layers
Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method (KKR).[15] in another
paper. But in this letter, we want to use numerical
method to illustrate the coupling coeﬃcient which are
strongly angular dependent. Meanwhile, we will study
the point imaging by PC slab and further analyze the
imaging quality versus diﬀerent surface termination of
photonic crystal slab.

We consider an imaging system composed by PC slab
with a thickness of seven rows of air holes, which is sur-
rounded by air. The surface normal is long ΓM direc-
tion, and the surface termination of PC slab on each
interface is denoted by δx. We have performed ﬁnite-
diﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) method with perfectly
matched layer boundary conditions[16]. A continuous-
wave point source is chosen and placed at the left side of
the PC slab. The frequency is ω = 0.30(a/λ), at which
the eﬀective refractive index of PC is nef f =
1. Fig-
ure 2(a-b) represent the snapshot of the electric ﬁeld for

δx = 0, δx = 0.2a, respectively.
there is a focused image on the right side of the PC slab
for each structure. The simulations clearly demonstrate
the negative refraction in such a PC slab. However, in
Fig. 2(a), there is a relatively ambiguous image on the
left side of PC slab, which means that the reﬂectivity
at the left interface is quite high. In general, a simple
dielectric interface between two media with refractive in-
dexes n1 and n2 is made antireﬂective by inserting an-
other medium with an intermediate index of √n1n2 and
an odd-multiple thickness of the quarter-wavelength in
the medium. Here, the surface termination of PC slab
is introduced, which has a similar eﬀect, to enhance the
coupling at the interface. It is shown in Fig. 2(b) that
there is a better image than that in Fig. 2(a). Note

that it happens in Fig. 2 that the source and the im-
age both have a π-diﬀerence. In general arbitrary phase
shifts are possible and can be chosen by design. The re-
sults of Fig. 2 indicate clearly that surface termination
of PC slab takes an important role for coupling eﬃciency.
Next, we will study the coupling at the air-PC interface
for diﬀerent angle in detail.

Here, we want to use the transfer function to study the
imaging quality [17]. Utilizing the discrete Fourier trans-
form (DFT) algorithm and FDTD method, we can get
the transfer function for such a PC slab, whose eﬀective
1. Figure 3(a-d) rep-
refractive index satisﬁes nef f =
resent the transfer functions of imaging system with the
surface termination of δx = 0, δx = 0.1a, δx = 0.2a, and
δx = 0.3a, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that
the transmissions are strongly angular dependent, which
is quite diﬀerent with the air-LHM (n =
1) interface.
This is mainly caused by the angular-dependent coupling
coeﬃcient at the air-PC interface. The transmissions are
almost near zero when kx/k0 > 1 since under this cir-
cumstance the light will become evanescent waves. The
results of Fig. 3 also show that transmissions are varia-
tional with the change of the surface terminations of PC
slab. Compared with the results for other surface termi-
nations, the transmissions with δx = 0.2a are relatively
large, which is consistent with the result of snapshots
of electric ﬁelds. Meanwhile, the transfer function for
δx = 0.2a is relatively ﬂat for all angles, which is essen-
tial for a good quality image. The results from the Fig. 3
also show that there exit some peaks in each of transfer
function. With the change of the surface termination,
the position of the peaks also shift. It can be explained
by the eﬀect of Fabry-Perot. The eﬀective width of the
photonic crystal slab will decrease as the surface termina-
tion of PC slab increases. Therefore, it can be understood
that the condition for resonant changes versus diﬀerent
surface termination of photonic crystal slab.

In summary, we have analyzed the coupling at the air-
PC interface when the eﬀective refractive index of PC
satisﬁes nef f =
1. Our results show the coupling coef-
ﬁcient are strongly angular dependent. Using numerical
simulations, we have demonstrated the negative refrac-
tion phenomenon and studied the point imaging by pho-
tonic crystal slab. Combining the discrete Fourier trans-
form algorithm with FDTD method, we have analyzed
the imaging system and got relatively good quality imag-
ing system when surface termination of photonic crystal
slab satisﬁes δx = 0.2a.

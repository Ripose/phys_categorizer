We investigate the reﬂection properties of electromagnetic/optical waves in isotropic chiral media. When
the chiral parameter is strong enough, we show that an unusual negative reﬂection occurs at the interface of
the chiral medium and a perfectly conducting plane, where the incident wave and one of reﬂected eigenwaves
lie in the same side of the boundary normal. Using such a property, we further demonstrate that such a
conducting plane can be used for focusing in the strong chiral medium. The related equations under paraxial
optics approximation are deduced. In a special case of chiral medium, the chiral nihility, one of the bi-reﬂections
disappears and only single reﬂected eigenwave exists, which goes exactly opposite to the incident wave. Hence
the incident and reﬂected electric ﬁelds will cancel each other to yield a zero total electric ﬁeld. In another word,
any electromagnetic waves entering the chiral nihility with perfectly conducting plane will disappear.

The chiral medium was ﬁrst explored in the begin-
ning of 19th century for its optical rotation phenomenon.
Then it is proved that right and left-hand circularly po-
larized waves have diﬀerent velocities and hence have
diﬀerent refraction indexes in the chiral medium. Dif-
ferent polarized rotations correspond to diﬀerent modes.
Therefore, bi-refraction happens at the boundary of chi-
ral media even if they are isotropic, due to the coexis-
tence of two diﬀerent modes caused by chirality.

In 1968, Veselago introduced the concept of negative
refraction when both permittivity and permeability are
simultaneously negative.1 In the currently hot research
of left-handed metamaterials, the chirality may be used
to split the degenerated transverse wave modes. If the
chiral parameter is strong enough or the chirality is com-
bined with electric plasma,2–10 one eigenwave becomes
backward wave, and a negative refraction is generated
naturally in one of the circularly polarized waves.

The earlier research on chiral media is concentrated in
the negative refraction and the relevant physical proper-
ties like the subwavelength focusing. The task of this pa-
per is to discuss the extraordinary reﬂection properties of
electromagnetic/optical waves in isotropic chiral media.
We will prove that bi-reﬂection exists at the boundary
of isotropic media. When the chiral parameter is strong
enough, there will be a negative reﬂection for one of the
reﬂected eigenwaves. Based on such a property, we show
that a plane mirror instead of a lens can be used for
focusing in the strong chiral medium and get a real im-
age for paraxial rays. Finally, we discuss the behavior
of electromagnetic waves in a chiral nihility with per-
fectly conducting plane. It is proved that only single
reﬂected eigenwave exists, which goes exactly opposite
to the incident wave. The incident and reﬂected electric

ﬁelds will cancel each other to yield a zero total electric
ﬁeld. Hence we discover an exotic phenomenon that any
electromagnetic waves entering the chiral nihility with
perfectly conducting plane will disappear.

In this paper, we deﬁne the right-hand polarized wave
is the one whose electric vector rotates clockwise when
looking along the energy stream. Consider a half-inﬁnite
space problem, where the left region is an isotropic chiral
medium and the right region is a perfectly electric con-
ductor (PEC). An incident right-polarized wave propa-
gates toward the boundary at an oblique angle θi in the
yoz plane, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Here, kx = 0 has
been assumed under the shown coordinate system.

Assume that the electric ﬁeld of incident wave is ex-

pressed using the e−iωt system as

to Maxwell equations and the constitutive relation for

where “+” and “

assumed to be positive in this paper. Similar dual con-
clusions can be easily expanded to the negative chirality.

µ/ǫ is the wave impedance of chiral me-
in which η =
dia. It is self-evident that it is left circularly polarized
wave if k2

wave if k2

ized wave must match with one of the eigenwaves and
be written as

z− = k2

~Ei = E0(ˆx

in which E0 is a free variable indicating the amplitude.
First we consider the case of weak chirality, where
< √µǫ. Traditionally, it is regarded as a natural limit
κ
|
to all chiral media for positive energy requirement. How-
ever, in the recent research on left-handed materials, we
know that the energy calculation in dispersive media is
not so simple, and negative wavenumber do not result in
negative energy at all.12 Hence, it is fairly possible that
strong chiral medium with κ > √µǫ also exists at some
frequency,2 which will be discussed later in this paper.
Under weak chirality, both k+ and k− are positive.

We need point out that reﬂected waves with diﬀerent
eigenmodes have diﬀerent k and kz, but the same ky due
to the phase matching on the boundary. So we may draw

ky+ = ky− = ky.

(11)

We assume that the projections of reﬂected energies and
phase vectors on the z axis are both negative as the com-
mon sense. Though the incident wave is a right-polarized
wave, we cannot ensure whether the reﬂected wave is
right or left polarized. Hence, we suppose that both ex-
ist, and then use the boundary condition to calculate
their coeﬃcients.

It is clear that the projections of right- and left-
kz−
polarized reﬂected wavenumbers on the z axis are
and
kz+. Here, both kz− and kz+ are positive for prop-
agating waves (ky < k±). From the boundary condition
on the PEC boundary, we have

ikz−/k− + A(ikz−)/k−

−

1 + A + B = 0,
B(ikz+)/k+ = 0,

(12)
(13)

where A and B are reﬂected coeﬃcients of the right- and
left-polarized waves separately. After simple derivation,
we obtain

A = (kz−k+
B =

kz+k−)/(kz−k+ + kz+k−),
2kz−k+/(kz+k− + kz−k+).

(14)

= 0 and B

= kz−, lead-
Hence, if there is any chirality, we have kz+
= 0. That is to say, both circularly
ing to A
polarized reﬂected waves exist. If there is no chirality,
we have A = 0. Hence the whole reﬂected wave is left
polarized for the right-polarized incident wave. And this
degeneration is just the common case of circularly polar-
ized wave reﬂection in non-chiral medium.

For the left- and right-polarized reﬂected waves, their
ˆzkz±, and the corresponding

k vectors are: k± = ˆyky
Poynting vectors are written as

We can see that neither k nor S vectors of the two po-
larized reﬂected waves are the same in chiral media.

Hence two diﬀerent eigenwaves will be generated from
the same incident wave in a boundary shown in Fig. 1(a),
resulting in bi-reﬂections. It seems not to satisfy geo-
metrical optics principles at the ﬁrst glance. However,
the chiral medium is a special material with such unique
characters: the refraction indexes n for a pair of right-
and left-polarized waves do not equal. In other words,
the chiral medium is one material to the right-polarized
wave and another to the left one. Considering the diﬀer-
ence between n+ and n−, the direction of each polarized
reﬂected wave satisﬁes Fermat principle.

For the right-polarized reﬂected wave, its reﬂected an-
gle equals the incident angle, i.e., θr− = θi, because the
refraction index of reﬂected wave equals the incident one.
For the left-polarized one, the reﬂected angle θr+ satis-
ﬁes

which is similar to the Snell’s law, since the refraction

two eigenwaves in chiral media.

We make another explanation of the bi-reﬂections in
chiral media. If we consider the PEC boundary as a per-
fect mirror, then we may get an image of incident wave
as an eﬀective problem shown in Fig. 1(b), in which the
mirrored chiral medium has an opposite κ. The chiral-
ity is generated by spatial asymmetry, hence it should
be reversed if the material structure is mirrored. In the
mirrored chiral medium, the right-polarized wave corre-
sponds to k+ and the left-polarized wave to k−. Then we
may turn the reﬂection problem into a refraction prob-
lem. From the boundary condition, we get the same re-
sult as Eqs. (14) and (15), indicating that bi-refraction
happens on the boundary between the two dual chiral
media. Hence we may also put kr± as the transmission
of k′
i. In other words, bi-reﬂection shares the common
essence with bi-refraction.

−

Next, we consider the case of strong chiral media,
where more interesting characters will appear. When
κ > √µǫ, we have k− = √µǫ
κ < 0. Hence the
right-polarized wave turns into a backward wave. That
is to say, E, H and k form a left-handed triad and the
Poynting vector S is antiparallel to k. However, the left-
polarized wave remains right-handed as in common me-
dia. When the incident wave is left circularly polarized, it
is a forward wave, as shown in Fig. 2(a). As the reﬂection
happens, the left-polarized reﬂected wave goes normally
while the right-polarized one is a backward wave. Here,
we will illustrate that a negative reﬂection happens for
the backward eigenwave.

Fig. 2. Strong chirality makes negative reﬂections. (a) Left-
polarized incidence. (b) Right-polarized incidence.

Based on the phase matching on the boundary, the
ky components of both reﬂected waves should be +ˆy di-
rected. Based on the causality principle, the Sz com-
ponents of both reﬂected waves should be
ˆz directed.
Hence the left-polarized reﬂected wave goes normally as
that in the weak-chirality case with θr+ = θi. For the
right-polarized reﬂected wave, kz is antiparallel to Sz
and hence a negative reﬂection occurs, where the inci-
dent and reﬂected wavevectors lie in the same side of the
boundary normal, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The reﬂected
angle θr− satisﬁes the Snell-like law

We remark that kz− has been assigned as positive in
this paper. Considering k− < 0, it is clear that ~Sr− is
antiparallel to ~kr− for the right-polarized reﬂected wave.
Negative reﬂection really happens.

In case of right circularly polarized incident wave, it is
a backward wave, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Now the wave
vector for incident wave is
kz− ˆz. Similarly, there

We see that the left-polarized reﬂected wave and the
incident wave lie in the same side of normal. Negative
reﬂection happens again.

Using such unusual reﬂection properties, we may re-
alize partial focusing of a source using a simple PEC
mirror. Actually the ﬁeld generated by a source can be
decomposed as left- and right-polarized waves. For both
polarized-wave incidences, the reﬂected waves will be
partially focused, as shown in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b), re-
spectively.

Taking paraxial approximation in Gaussian optics, we
may get a reasonably good image for this partial fo-
cusing. Assume that the distance from the source to

reﬂected wave disappears, and a total reﬂection occurs to
the right-polarized reﬂected wave, as shown in Fig. 4(a).
Here, the wavevectors of incident and reﬂected waves are
the same (directing to the up-right direction), while the
Poynting vectors are opposite.

It is true that the positively reﬂected wave will diverge,
not participating in the partial focusing but forming an
imaginary image. However, in the paraxial case, we have
kz− for the strong chiral medium.
k+ ∼= kz+ and k− ∼=
Hence the amplitudes of positively-reﬂected waves are
close to zero, which may be neglected. That is to say,
most paraxial rays reﬂected negatively for partial focus-
ing.

Considering the negative reﬂections in the strong chi-
ral medium, some conclusions in the conventional Gaus-
sian optics need to be improved. For one thing, the real
images we get are not upsidedown as real images always
do. On the other hand, we may generalize our analysis
into spherical reﬂection surface. In strong chiral medium,
the reﬂection relationship between object and image dis-
tances can be written as:

(30)

where R is the radius of the spherical surface, which is
positive if convex and negative if concave, and s′ < 0
for the imaginary image. In the weak chirality case, we
may draw the same results as those in Eqs. (29) and
(30) though there is no negative reﬂection. These are
the general reﬂection relationships of all chiral media in
paraxial Gaussian optics.

It will be more interesting to discuss a special case of
chiral medium: the chiral nihility with µǫ = 0.2 In chiral
nihility, we easily have k± =
ωκ. Hence the correspond-
±
ing physical features are quite similar to those in the
strong-chirality medium, and the formulations (19)-(28)
can be directly used. For propagating waves (
< ωκ),

we obtain kz− = kz+ under our deﬁnition in this paper.

incidence. (b) Right-polarized incidence.

When the incident wave is right polarized, we then
have AR = 0 and BR =
1. That is to say, the right-
polarized reﬂected wave disappears, and a total reﬂection
occurs to the left-polarized reﬂected wave, as illustrated
in Fig. 4(b). Again, the wavevectors of incident and re-
ﬂected waves are the same (directing to the down-left
direction), while the Poynting vectors are opposite.

−

Based on the above discussions, we can easily show
that the totally reﬂected electric ﬁelds counteract the in-
cident electric ﬁelds exactly in both polarized incidences
in the chiral nihility, which results in zero total electric
ﬁelds. If ǫ = 0 and µ
= 0, we can show that all magnetic
ﬁelds must be zero from the dispersion equation. In such
a case, all total electric and magnetic ﬁelds disappear
in the chiral nihility. If ǫ = 0 and µ = 0, the magnetic
ﬁelds may exist because the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
are decoupled completely.

For evanescent waves (

It is more interesting to consider a chiral nihility
bounded by two PEC mirrors. When a wave is excited
in the chiral nihility, the wave will be totally reﬂected
forwardly and backwardly again and again between two
mirrors based on the earlier discussions, as shown in Fig.
5. All waves from the source will focus at the source
point. Using the boundary conditions, we have shown
exactly that the total reﬂected electric ﬁelds including
left- and right-polarized components at any points sat-
isfy

~Er = ~Er+ + ~Er− =

(31)

which is valid to both propagating-wave and evanescent-
wave incidences. Hence, the total electric ﬁelds at any
points inside the chiral nihility are zero. If ǫ = 0 and
= 0, the total magnetic ﬁelds are also zero. Hence,

a source could not radiate eﬀectively inside the chiral
nihility bounded by two PEC mirrors.

In conclusions, negative reﬂections occur at the bound-
ary of strong-chiral medium and PEC mirror, which di-
rectly result in partial focusing using a simple plane mir-
ror. Any propagating waves entering the chiral nihility
(ǫ = 0 and µ
= 0) with a PEC plane will disappear.
Any sources could not radiate inside the chiral nihility

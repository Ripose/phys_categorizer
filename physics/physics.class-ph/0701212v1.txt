Abstract: We show that Gutzwiller’s characterization of chaotic Hamiltonian systems in
terms of the curvature associated with a Riemannian metric tensor in the structure of
the Hamiltonian can be extended to a wide class of potential models of standard form
through deﬁnition of a conformal metric. The geodesic equations reproduce the Hamilton
equations of the original potential model when a transition is made to the dual manifold,
and the geodesics in the dual space coincide with the orbits of the Hamiltonian potential
model. We therefore ﬁnd a direct geometrical description of the time development of a
Hamiltonian potential model. The second covariant derivative of the geodesic deviation
in this dual manifold generates a dynamical curvature, resulting in (energy dependent)
criteria for unstable behavior diﬀerent from the usual Lyapunov criteria. We discuss some
examples of unstable Hamiltonian systems in two dimensions giving, in particular, detailed
results for a potential obtained from a ﬁfth order expansion of a Toda lattice Hamiltonian.

Gutzwiller1 has pointed out that a Hamiltonian system of the form (we use the sum-

mation convention)

H =

gijpipj,

1
2M

where gij is a function of the coordinates alone, can have chaotic orbits if the curvature
associated with the metric gij is negative. The resulting curvature is a property of the
manifold of solutions for the equations of motion generated by this Hamiltonian.

One can easily see that the orbits described by the Hamilton equations for (1) coincide
with the geodesics on a Riemannian space associated with the metric gij, 1,2 i.e., it follows
directly from the Hamilton equations associated with (1) that (using the time derivative
of (11) and (12) below)

where D/Dt is the covariant derivative along the line xj(t). The sign of the scalar con-
traction of (4) then gives information on the stability of the orbits3.

In this Letter, we point out that this formulation of dynamic stability has application
to a much wider range of Hamiltonian models; in fact, every potential model Hamiltonian
of the form

where V is a function of space variables alone, can be put into the form (1), where the
metric tensor is of conformal form.4 We obtain in this way a direct geometrical description
of the time development for a Hamiltonian potential model.

Casetti, Pettini and collaborators5 have studied the application of both the Jacobi
and Eisenhardt metrics in their analysis of the geometry of Hamiltonian chaos. The Jacobi
metric (of the form (E − V )δij) leads to geodesic equations parametrized by the invariant
distance associated with this metric on the manifold, in this case, the kinetic energy, thus
corresponding to the Hamilton action. Transformation to parametrization by the time t
leads to the second order Newton law5. The Eisenhardt metric, leading to geodesic motion
in t, involves the addition of an extra dimension. Although our approach is somewhat
diﬀerent, one may apply the very useful techniques of refs. 5, such as their development
of relations with statistical mechanics, in this approach as well.

The formulation of Hamiltonian dynamics of the type of Eq.(6) in the form (1) is

carried out by requiring that (6) be equivalent to (1). For a metric of conformal form

we see that on the hypersurface deﬁned by H = E = constant, our requirement of equiv-
alence implies that

Substituting this result in the geodesic equations (2), one obtains (in the special

coordinate system of (7))

To see that the Hamilton equations obtained from (1) can be put into correpondence
with those obtained from the Hamiltonian of the potential model (6), we ﬁrst note, from
the Hamilton equations for (1), that

We then use the geometrical property that ˙xi is a ﬁrst rank tensor (as is pi), under local
diﬀeomorphisms that preserve the constraint that H be constant, to deﬁne the velocity
ﬁeld

coinciding formally with the ﬁrst of the Hamilton equations implied by (6).

To complete our correspondence with the dynamics induced by (6), consider the

Hamilton equation for ˙pi,

With the form (7) for gij, we obtain in the particular coordinate system in which (6) is
deﬁned,

characterizes a set of functions {xj} for which the diﬀerentials are related to dxj by local
scaling. Then, (13) becomes

the second Hamilton equation in the usual form, where V is considered a function of the
{xℓ}, now considered as independent variables.

As a coordinate space, the {xℓ} are not uniquely deﬁned in terms of the original
manifold {xℓ}, which we shall call the Gutwiller manifold, since (11) and (14) are not
exact diﬀerentials, but we assert that the set of functions obtained by integrating (14) (on
paths that cover the open set deﬁned by E −V > 0) span a dual manifold {xℓ} that we shall
call the Hamilton manifold. According to our deﬁnition (11), these two manifolds have
a common tangent space at every point. It is this local relation which induces, from the
geometry of the Gutzwiller manifold, a corresponding geometry on the Hamilton manifold.

Considering (11) as a change of variables,

and the resulting curvature tensor for the Gutwiller manifold can be computed from (4).
We shall discuss applications and interpretation of the physics of this manifold elsewhere,
but turn now to a further examination of the consequences of the transformation repre-
sented by (11).

The geodesic equation (2) can be transformed directly from an equation for ¨xj to an

equation for ¨xj, the motion deﬁned in the Hamilton manifold. From (11) it follows that

Now, using the identity

Thus, the term on the left side of (17) containing the derivative of gℓj cancels the ﬁrst two
terms of the connection form; multiplying the result by the inverse of gℓj, and applying
the identity (18) to lower the indices of gnm in the remaining term on the right side of
(17), one obtains (this result may be obtained directly from (11) and (12))

where

¨xℓ = −M ℓ

Eq. (20) has the form of a geodesic equation, with a truncated connection form. In fact, it
can be shown (a full proof will be given elsewhere) that the form (21) is indeed a connection
form, transforming as

consistent with the covariance of (20) under local diﬀeomorphisms of the Hamilton mani-
fold.

This result describes motion generated by the potential model Hamiltonian in the
Hamilton space. To see this in a simple way, we substitute (7) and (8) into (20) and
(21). The Kronecker deltas identify the indices of ˙xm and ˙xn; the resulting square of the
velocity cancels a factor of (E − V )−1, leaving the Hamilton-Newton law (15). The direct
transformation of (9) to the variables {xℓ} provides, of course, the same result.

Eq. (20), however, describes the Hamiltonian evolution in a completely geometric
form, as a geodesic on the Hamilton manifold. This structure for the goedesics on the
Hamilton manifold can be understood as follows.

Let us write the covariant derivative for a (rank one) covariant tensor on the Gutwiller
manifold (deﬁned as transforming in the same way as ∂/∂xm), using the full connection
form (3),

Am;q =

− Γmq

Lowering the index q with gℓq, we obtain the covariant derivative in the Hamilton manifold,
with connection form (with the help of (19))

This induced connection form, in the formula for curvature, would give a curvature cor-
responding the the Hamilton manifold. However, it is antisymmetric in its lower indices
(ℓ, k) (torsion). Taken along a line parametrized by t, corresponding to geodesic motion,
the antisymmetric terms cancel, leaving precisely the symmetric connection form (21). A
complete discussion of the tensors on the Gutzwiller space and its dual, the Hamilton
manifold, will be given elsewhere, but it is important to emphasize here that the curvature
associated with the geodesic deviation in the Hamilton manifold, as we shall see below, is
not the same as the intrinsic curvature of that manifold, but rather, due to the presence
of torsion, a special curvature form associated with the geodesics themselves.

(23)

Since the coeﬃcients M ℓ

mn constitute a connection form, one can construct a covariant
derivative with them. In the computation of geodesic deviation between two close lying
orbits (correlated by the time parameter t), the diﬀerence

can be considered an inﬁnitesimal, and therefore a tensor. A covariant derivative con-
structed from the connection form (21) can therefore act on ξℓ, for which, therefore,

ξℓ = x

′ℓ − xℓ

ξℓ
;n =

∂ξℓ

is a tensor.
It is this covariant derivative which must be used to compute the rate of
transport of ξℓ along the (approximately common) motion of the neighboring orbits, since
it follows the geometrical structure of the geodesics.

This covariant derivative, along the path given by xℓ(t), can be used to factorize the

second order geodesic deviation equations

¨ξℓ = −2M ℓ

Substituting the conformal metric (7) into (26), and taking into account the constraint
that both trajectories x′ℓ and xℓ have the same energy E, one sees that (26) becomes the
orbit deviation equation based on (15).

However, in terms of the second covariant derivative of the form (23) on the curve

This expression, as remarked above, is not the curvature of the Hamilton manifold, but a
dynamical curvature which is appropriate for the geodesics.

We give in the following a general formula for the geodesic deviation in the Hamilton
manifold in two dimensions, and then show results of computer simulation for Poincar´e
plots showing a correspondence with the prediction of instability from the geodesic devia-
tion.

With the special form of the conformal metric, the dynamical curvature (28) can be
written in terms of derivatives of the potential V , and the geodesic deviation equation (27)
becomes

where the matrix V is given by

M ξ

DM t2 = −VP ξ,

with vi ≡ ˙xi, deﬁning a projection into a direction orthogonal to vi.

We then ﬁnd for the components orthogonal and parallel to the motion

Instability should occur if at least one of the eigenvalues of V is negative, in terms of

the second covariant derivatives of the transverse component of the geodesic deviation.

One may easily verify that the oscillator potential is predicted to be stable. Our
criteria imply that the Duﬃng oscillator (without perturbation, not a chaotic system)

clearly indicates instability in a neighborhood of the unstable ﬁxed point. The potentials
discussed by Oloumi and Teychenne6 also demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our procedure;
our results in these cases are in agreement with theirs. The H´enon-Heiles model, exhibit-
ing soft chaos1 (easily seen in the geodesic deviation equation (26)), may be derived by
expanding the two body Toda lattice Hamiltonian with exponential interaction in Taylor
series to fourth order. The ﬁfth order expansion, for which the potential is

provides a new Hamilton chaotic system for which our criterion gives a clear local signal
for the presence of instability. Fig.1 shows that the region of negative eigenvalues does not
penetrate the physically accessible region for E = 1/6; ﬁg. 2 shows a Poincar´e plot in the
y, py plane for this case, indicating completely regular orbits.. In ﬁg. 3, the distribution of
negative eigenvalues for E = 3 is shown to penetrate deeply into the physical region, and
ﬁg. 4 shows the corresponding Poincare´e plot displaying a high degree of chaotic behavior.
The criterion for instability we have given depends sensitively on the energy of the system.
The critical energy for which the negative eigenvalues begin to penetrate the physically
accessible region, in this example, is E ∼= 1/5.

The condition implied by the geodesic deviation equation (29), in terms of covariant
derivatives, in which the orbits are viewed geometrically as geodesic motion, is a new
condition for instability, based on the underlying geometry, for a Hamiltonian system of
the form (6). This geometrical picture of Hamiltonian dynamics provides a new insight into
the structure underlying unstable and chaotic behavior of Hamiltonian dynamical systems.

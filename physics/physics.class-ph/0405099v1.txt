third law revisited

Abstract

Under certain conditions usually fulﬁlled in classical mechanics, the principle of conservation of linear
momentum and the Newton’s third law are equivalent. However, the demonstration of such fact is
usually incomplete in textbooks. We shall show here that to demonstrate the equivalence, we require the
explicit use of the principle of superposition contained in the Newton’s second law. On the other hand,
under some additional conditions the combined laws of linear and angular momentum conservation, are
equivalent to the Newton’s third law with central forces. The conditions for such equivalence applies in
many scenarios of classical mechanics, once again the principle of superposition of the second Newton’s
law is the clue.

Commom texts of mechanics [1], usually state that Newton’s third law automatically leads to the principle
of conservation of linear momentum. However, the reciprocal is also true under certain conditions, the proof
in reversal order is either absent or restricted to systems of two particles in most of the textbooks.

We start from the statement of the principle of linear momentum conservation for a closed and isolated

system of particles‡, respect to a certain inertial frame

but according to the Newton’s second law, dPi

Where Fij stands for the force on the i−th particle due to the j−th particle. In the case of two particles, Eq.
(3) leads to the Newton’s third law automatically. However in the case of an arbitrary number of particles,
the Newton’s third law is only a suﬃcient condition at this step. The proof of necessity is the one that is
usually absent in textbooks.

In order to prove the necessity, we shall use the principle of superposition stated in the Newton’s second
law. For a system of n particles let us take a couple of particles k and l. They undergo the force of each
other Fkl and Flk respectively, plus the internal forces due to the other particles of the system. However,
according to the second law, the forces Fkl and Flk are not altered by the presence of the rest of the forces
(i.e. the other forces do not interfere with them), therefore if we withdrew the other particles of the system

leaving the particles k and l in the same position, the forces Fkl and Flk would be the same as the ones
when all particles were interacting. Now, after the withdrawal of the other particles our system consists of
two isolated particles for which the third law is evident, therefore Fkl = −Flk. We proceed in the same way
for all the pairs of particles and obtain that Fij = −Fji for all i, j in the system. Observe that the proof
of necessity requires the use of the principle of superposition contained in the Newton’s second law. Since
we have demonstrated the necessity and suﬃciency we have proved the equivalence. Notwithstanding, this
equivalence is based on many implicit assumptions

1. The Newton’s second law is valid : As it is well known, in scenarios such as quantum mechanics the

concept of force is not meaningful any more.

2. The time runs in the same way for all inertial observers: We have used this condition since in the
time derivative of Eq. (2) we do not mention what inertial system we have used to measure the time.
Besides, this condition is necessary to assume that the force is equal in all inertial systems.

3. All the momentum of the system is carried by the particles: In this approach we are ignoring the possible
storage or transmision of momentum from the ﬁelds generated by the interactions (see discussion in
Ref. [3]).

4. The signals transmitting the interactions travel instantaneously: In Eq. (1), each momentum Pi is
supposed to be measured at the same time. If any particle of the system changes its momentum at
the time t, then to preserve the law of conservation of momentum (at the time t), it is necessary that
the rest of the particles change their momenta at the same time, in such a way that they cancel
the change of momentum caused by the i − th particle. This fact is in turn related to the condition
that all the momentum is carried by the particles (mechanical momentum). In other words, the other
particles must learn of the momentum change of the i−th particle instantaneously.

As it has been emphasized in the literature, even in the case in which all these assumptions fail, the
principle of momentum conservation is still held while the Newton’s third law is not valid any more, from
which it follows the advantage of formulating the empirical principles of classical mechanics in terms of the
concept of momentum. Even when the assumptions made above are accomplished, the formulation in terms
of momentum is advantageous [2]. Nevertheless, we emphasize that under the conditions cited above, the
Newton’s third law is equivalent to the principle of linear momentum conservation, but the complete proof
of that statement requires the principle of superposition of forces established by the Newton’s second law.

On the other hand, by a similar argument we can show the equivalence of combined conservation of linear
and angular momentum with the Newton’s third law with central forces. Starting from the conservation of
angular momentum for a closed isolated system, respect to an inertial frame

L = L1+L2+... + Ln = constant

(4)

and deriving this equation we ﬁnd

and from the deﬁnition of Li and taking into account that the system is isolated, we get for the particle i

The derivative of the total angular momentum reads

under the assumption Fij = −Fji (obtained from the conservation of linear momentum) we can show by
induction the following identity

clearly the Newton’s third law with central forces (i.e. Fij = −Fji and (ri − rj) parallel to Fij) is a suﬃcient
condition for the angular and linear momentum conservation (we shall refer to the third law with central
forces as the strong version of the Newton’s third law henceforth). To prove the necessity we resort again to
the argument of isolating one pair of particles k, l without changing their positions. Since this two particles
system is now isolated its total angular momentum must be constant, and remembering that the forces
Fkl = −Flk have not changed either, we have

dL (two particles)
dt

= (rk − rl) × Fkl = 0

now, since both particles have diﬀerent positions and we are assuming that they are interacting (Fkl 6= 0)§,
we obtain that (rk − rl) must be parallel to Fkl. We can proceed in a similar way for all possible pairs
of particles in the system. In this case we have used the combined laws of linear and angular momentum
conservation since the Newton’s third law in its weak version was assumed since the beginning. Of course,
the conditions for this equivalence to be held are the ones cited above but with analogous assumptions for
the angular momentum as well.

As before, when the conditions for this equivalence fail, the laws of conservation of linear and angular

momentum are still valid, while the strong version of the Newton’s third law no longer holds.

An important issue arises when we consider non-isolated systems, since we have assumed that the system
is isolated throughout the document. If we add external forces, once again the principle of superposition
states that the internal forces do not interfere with them, and so the Newton’s third law is maintained. A
similar argument holds for possible external torques and the Newton’s third law in its strong version.

In conclusion, we have proved that under certain conditions the principle of linear momentum conser-
vation is equivalent to the weak version of the Newton’s third law. Analogously, under similar conditions,
the combined laws of linear and angular momentum conservation are equivalent to the strong version of
the Newton’s third law. We emphasize that for both demonstrations we should resort to the principle of
superposition contained in the Newton’s second law¶. Finally, it is worth saying that the suppositions to get
these equivalences are implicit in the original formalism of classical mechanics. Therefore, such equivalences
deserve more attention, at least until the arrival to relativity, quantum mechanics or classical (quantum)
ﬁeld theories.

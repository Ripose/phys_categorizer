Abstract

In recent times there has been a renewed interest in the force experienced by a
charged-particle with anomalous magnetic moment in the presence of external
ﬁelds. In this paper we address the basic question of the force experienced by
a spin- 1
2 point-like charged-particle with magnetic and electric moments in the
presence of space-and time-dependent external electromagnetic ﬁelds, when
derived from the Dirac equation via the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation
technique. It is interesting to note that the force thus derived diﬀers from the
ones obtained by various other prescriptions.

I. INTRODUCTION

We present a derivation of the force experienced by a spin- 1

2 point-like charged-particle
with anomalous magnetic and anomalous electric moments in the presence of space-and
time-dependent external electromagnetic ﬁelds, based ab initio on the Dirac equation via
the Foldy-Wouthuysen (FW) transformation technique. In the present derivation we neglect
the radiation reaction and the electromagnetic ﬁelds are treated as classical.

In absence of spin the force experienced by a point-like charged-particle is completely
described by the Lorentz force law (F L = q (E + v × B)). In the regime where the spin
and the magnetic moment are to be taken into account the question of the form of the
force obtained from the relativistic quantum theory is still unresolved to this day, though
extensive studies, using diverse approaches have been done since the discovery of quantum
mechanics. This is evident from the numerous approaches/prescriptions which have been
tried to address this basic question and are still being tried. Before proceeding further we
note that the expression quoted above constitutes the Lorentz force. The total force which

we call as the Lorentz-Stern-Gerlach (LSG) force includes the Lorentz force as the basic
constituent and all the other contributions coming from the spin, anomalous magnetic and
electric moments etc,. The reason for this nomenclature will be clear as we proceed.

Here we quote a few approaches which have been used to address the question of the force
and acceleration experienced by a charged-particle. A Lagrangian formalism based on the
action principle has been suggested [1]- [3]. A Hamiltonian formalism is considered in [4]–
[5].
In the case of slowly varying electromagnetic ﬁelds an approach based on the Dirac
equation via the WKB approximation scheme has been presented [6]. In the context of the
Aharonov-Bohm and Aharonov-Casher eﬀects [7]- [8], the question as to whether neutron
acceleration can occur in uniform electromagnetic ﬁelds is also raised [9]- [11]. In the very
recent work of Chaichian [4] it has been rightly pointed out that in the nonrelativistic limit
the results of the above approaches do not coincide. This motivates us to examine the
form of the force derived from the Dirac equation using the FW-transformation [13]- [14]
scheme; note that the FW-transformation technique is the only one in which we can take
the meaningful nonrelativistic limit of the Dirac equation [15]. The FW-approach gives the
expression for the force in the presence of external time-dependent ﬁelds, the nonrelativistic
limit and a systematic procedure to obtain the relativistic corrections to a desired degree of
accuracy. In such a derivation we also take into account the anomalous electric moment. We
compare the results of our derivation with other approaches mentioned above. One should
also note that a novel approach for producing polarized beams has been suggested using the
Stern-Gerlach forces [16]- [17].

Let us consider the Dirac particle of rest mass m0, charge q, anomalous magnetic moment
µa and anomalous electric moment ǫa. In presence of the external electromagnetic ﬁelds,
the Dirac equation is

where σ is the triplet of Pauli matrices.

In the nonrelativistic situation the upper pair of components of the Dirac spinor ΨD are
large compared to the lower pair of components. The operator ˆE which does not couple
the large and small components of ΨD is called as even and ˆO is called as an odd operator
which couples the large to small components. Note that β ˆO = − ˆOβ and β ˆE = ˆEβ. This
motivates us to look for a transformation which will eliminate the odd-part completely from

2

the Dirac Hamiltonian. Such a transformation is available in the case of the free-particle.
In the very general case of time-dependent ﬁelds such a transformation is not known to
exist. Therefore, one has to be content with an approximation procedure which reduces the
strength of the odd-part to a desired degree of accuracy in powers of
m0c2 . We shall follow
the Foldy-Wouthuysen [13]- [14] transformation technique to take the nonrelativistic limit
of the Dirac Hamiltonian in (4) to reduce the strength of the odd-part in power series in
m0c2 . The result to the leading order, that is to order

A detailed discussion of the FW-transformation and the derivation of the above Hamiltonians
can be found in many places (for instance the book by Bjorken and Drell in [14]).

As a ﬁrst step we consider the case of a charged particle neglecting the anomalous

moments. In this case the Hamiltonian (6) works out to

In the nonrelativistic limit the force F is well-approximated by the expression F = m0a.
So we can use the expression for the acceleration, a derived using the Foldy-Wouthuysen
technique to express the force experienced by the charged particle.

The leading order Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian, when we take the anomalous mag-

netic moment and anomalous electric moment into account is given by

ˆH(2) = m0c2 − µaσ · B + ǫaσ · E + qφ

Next, to leading order Hamiltonian is given in (A1) of the appendix.

In the above expression in (18) the leading terms have been retained and the “· · ·” indicates
the higher order terms. The complete expression is given in (A2) in the appendix. The
detailed formulae shall be given in an appendix at the end. This is the case where ever
the “· · ·” appear in the expressions.

From the expression (18) we conclude that the leading order (linear in µa) contributions
to the neutron acceleration come through the gradients and the time derivatives of the
electromagnetic ﬁelds. Such contributions disappear in the case of uniform and constant
ﬁelds respectively. The next-to-leading order contributions come from the terms of the type
µ2
aE × (σ × B). Such contributions do not vanish and hence we have neutron acceleration
even in the presense of uniform ﬁelds. Such accelerations are quadratic (and higher powers)
in µa and hence are very small.

In the expression (16) for the Lorentz-Stern-Gerlach force if we substitute µa = g ¯h|q|
4m0

and q = −e we get the often mentioned term, +g (g − 2) E × (σ × B) in [6].

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND SUMMARY

As can be seen above we get a variety of terms contributing to the Lorentz-Stern-Gerlach

force.

The nonrelativistic static limit coincides with the usual “classical” formula if B is time-
independent, inhomogeneous and E is absent in the lab system. Otherwise there are diﬀer-
ences even at low non-relativistic velocities. In particular one may consider the force terms

that are present whenever a spin- 1

∇ (σ · (v × E)) and

(cid:16)

Another relevant point to be noted is the force experienced by a neutron (more generally
by an electrically neutral particle). In this case we ﬁnd contributions even when the ﬁelds
are homogeneous and static.

The LSG force derived using the FW-tchnique diﬀers from the other approaches which

use a “classical” or “semiclassical” treatment of the relativistic Stern-Gerlach force [5].

Only experiments with very high precision can conclude about the ﬁner diﬀerences in

the various expressions for the force.

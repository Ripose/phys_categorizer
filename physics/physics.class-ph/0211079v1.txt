(Dated: February 2, 2008)

The motion of a hoop hung on a spinning wire provides an illustrative and pedagogical example of a supercrit-
ical bifurcation. Above a certain angular velocity threshold Ωc, the hoop rises, making an angle θ ≃ (Ω−Ωc)1/2
with the vertical. The equation of motion is derived in the limit of a long massless wire, and the calculated steady
states are compared to experimental measurements. This simple experiment is suitable for classroom demon-
stration, and provides an interesting alternative to the classical experiment of the bead sliding on a rotation
hoop.

INTRODUCTION

The rotation of rigid bodies often displays interesting insta-
bility problems. Bodies with three different inertia moments
are well known to have unstable rotation about the interme-
diate axis1, as commonly observed from acrobatic jumps or
dives. Throwing a tennis racket provides an easy illustration
of this instability of the free rotation. Such purely inertial
instability has no threshold, i.e.
it can be observed for very
low rotation rates. In contrast, for axisymmetric bodies such
as hoops, disks, rockets, eggs etc., the free rotations remain
stable, but different mechanisms may also lead to instability
when external forces are present. Under some circumstances,
spectacular and unexpected instabilities may originate from
frictional forces. This is the case for the tippe-top, a popular
toy that ﬂips over and rotates on its stem, or for the hard-
boiled egg problem, which has recently received a nice anal-
ysis2. More classically, the competition between gravity and
centrifugal forces may lead to an instability with a ﬁnite ro-
tation rate threshold3, as illustrated by the simple experiment
described in this paper.

A hoop is hung on a long wire, whose upper end is spun. At
low rotation rate, the hoop is vertical and simply spins about
its diameter. Increasing the rotation rate, the hoop progres-
sively rises and becomes horizontal, spinning about its sym-
metry axis. This situation may appear paradoxical, since the
horizontal position maximizes both kinetic and potential en-
ergy. It is similar to the conical pendulum problem1, com-
monly illustrated in the classical demonstration experiment of
the bead sliding along a vertically rotating hoop4,5,6. The pop-
ular ‘hula hoop’ game, where the wire rotation is replaced by
the hips oscillations of the player, is a common illustration of
this phenomenon. Once the hoop spins horizontally, its rota-
tion is maintained by a parametric oscillation mechanism7.

In this paper, the equation of motion is derived from the La-
grange’s equation. An alternate derivation, from the angular
momentum equation, is also presented as a good illustration
of dynamics of a rigid body. The hoop is shown to rise fol-
lowing a supercritical bifurcation for the wire rotation rate Ω
above a critical value Ωc = (2g/R)1/2, where g is the gravita-
tional acceleration and R the hoop radius. The stable solution
Ωc)1/2 coincides with that of the conical pendulum
θ
or the bead-on-a-hoop. The nonlinear oscillations are brieﬂy
described by means of phase portraits, and compared to that of
the bead-on-a-hoop. Simple considerations from wire torsion

and air friction allow us to estimate the startup and damping
timescales. Finally some experimental measurements are re-
ported, and are shown to compare well with the exact solution.

In this experiment, the angular rotation threshold being of
order of a few rad/s, the wire can be simply spun with the
ﬁngers. Since it only requires a wire and a hoop, this exper-
iment can be conveniently used as a classroom illustration of
spontaneous symmetry breaking and bifurcation. Although
the detail of the calculation is somewhat more subtle than that
of the classical bead-on-a-hoop problem, since it deals with
rigid body dynamics, the physics is basically the same and
does not require the much heavier apparatus of the bead-on-a-
hoop demonstration.

A. Equation of motion

We consider a thin uniform hoop, of radius R and mass m,
ﬁxed at a point P of its periphery by a massless wire of length
R (see ﬁgure 1). The wire is spun from its other end
L
O at a constant angular velocity Ω. The center of mass G is
assumed to remain at the vertical of O. Let us ﬁrst consider a
torsionless wire, so that the hoop angular velocity ˙φ about the
vertical axis ez instantaneously follows the imposed angular
velocity Ω.

Let us consider the rotating frame of reference of the hoop
(e1, e2, e3). We note θ the pitch angle between the hoop plane
and the vertical axis ez. We consider for simplicity a zero
roll angle about e1 (i.e. we assume that the point P remains
the highest point of the hoop), so that θ is the only degree of
freedom for this problem. The absolute angular velocity ω of
the hoop has two contributions. The ﬁrst one, of magnitude Ω,
is imposed from O through the torsionless wire, and is about
ez = cos θ e1 + sin θ e3 (the points O and G are at rest, so
that OG is the instantaneous axis of rotation when θ is kept
constant). The second one comes from the pitch variation ˙θ,
and is about the axis e2. We therefore obtain

B. Steady states and small oscillations

We are interested in the steady states and the natural fre-
quency for small oscillations about them. To ﬁrst order in θ,
equation (3) reduces to

It is worth noting that this linearized equation is exactly the
same as the one from the bead-in-a-hoop problem4. The dif-
ference between equations (3) and (7) originates from the ki-
netic energy of the center of mass translation, which is not
present in the bead-on-a-hoop.

In addition to the trivial solution θeq = 0, equation (7) has

Stability and natural frequency for small oscillations are ob-
tained by introducing in equation (7) a small perturbation in
the form

θ(t) = θeq + δθ e(σ+iω)t,

(10)

where θeq stands for the trivial or non-trivial solution. The
trivial solution is stable for Ω < Ωc (σ = 0), with a natural
Ω2)1/2, and unstable for Ω > Ωc, with
frequency ω = (Ω2
a growth rate given by σ = (Ω2
c)1/2 (and ω = 0). The
non-trivial solution (8) is found to be always stable, with the
same natural frequency. In terms of ǫ, one can see that the
period of the oscillations,

may affect the dynamics of the system. The orbits in the phase
space (θ, ˙θ) then provide a useful tool to characterize the non-
linear dynamics of the hula hoop, and to compare it with the
one of the bead-on-a-hoop (7). The equation of motion can be

(Ω/Ωc = 1.2, ﬁg. b) the transition, together with the orbits of
the bead-on-a-hoop problem (dashed lines). One can clearly
see from these phase portraits the trivial solution θeq = 0 for
Ω/Ωc = 0.8 and the two non trivial solutions (8) separated by
a saddle point at θ = 0 for Ω/Ωc = 1.2. Note that we are only

D. Timescales

Two timescales are relevant for a practical experiment: the
startup timescale of rotation τs and the damping timescale of
oscillations τd. The startup timescale may be obtained consid-
ering the wire torsion. We start from an initially vertical hoop
(θ = 0), and let now its rotation angle φ about ez be free.
The wire communicates a torque κ(φ
Ωt) = κ δφ to the
hoop, where κ is the torsion constant and δφ the wire torsion.
The angular momentum equation about ez applied to the hoop
then reads

−

mR2δ ¨φ + κ δφ = 0,

(13)

1
2

R(m/2κ)1/2 (which cor-
leading to a startup timescale τs ≃
responds also to the period of the wire torsion oscillations if
no damping were present).

The damping timescale τd is relevant both for the φ oscilla-
tions due to the wire torsion, and for the θ oscillations around
the equilibrium states. It can be obtained considering the dis-
sipation with the surrounding air. With typical velocity of or-
der m/s and hoop thickness w of a few millimeters, we can
make use of a turbulent estimate for the drag force. Neglect-
ing ˙θ compared to ˙φ, a unit length dl of the hoop experiences
ρR2 ˙φ2w dl, where ρ is the air density. Inte-

For values of practical interest, τd is of order of a few tens
of the rotation period Ω−1. Note here that in the case of the
real hula hoop game, the rolling friction on the player hips is
fortunately dominant, leading to a damping timescale of order
Ω−1.

theoretical value. The discrepancy at low rotation rate is typi-
cal of an imperfect bifurcation, where small asymmetry in the
apparatus (such as the position of the knot) slightly anticipates
the destabilization of the basic state.

≥

An interesting observation is that, for Ω

2.6Ωc (see the
dashed line in ﬁgure 4), the bifurcated state is no stable any
more: a secondary instability appears, in the form of a slow
precession of the center of mass, with a period of about ten ro-
tation periods. This new behavior is probably an effect of the
non zero mass of the wire, and can clearly not be described in
our calculation, where the hoop center of mass is constrained
to remain aligned with the vertical axis.

Transient phenomena may also be investigated, by means
of usual video processing. An illustration is given in ﬁgure 5,
showing a spatio-temporal diagram obtained by collecting the
light intensity recorded on a horizontal line passing through
the wire. In this example, the imposed frequency Ω/2π has
been suddenly increased from 0 to 5.5 Hz
2.4 Ωc/2π (ﬁrst
arrow). One can see that, after a transient time of around
7 s (second arrow) during which the wire rotation propagates
down to the hoop, the amplitude increases and saturates to a
ﬁnite value.

≃

From this diagram, the instantaneous pitch angle as well
as the instantaneous oscillation frequency ˙φ/2π may be ex-
tracted, as shown in ﬁgure 6. The frequency is obtained from
averaging over 6 successive oscillations. Due to the progres-
sive torsion of the wire, this frequency slowly approaches its
imposed value 5.5 Hz. As a consequence, the increase of
1.42 rad
the pitch angle towards its stationary value θeq ≃
is rather slow.

It is interesting to note that, when plotting the instantaneous
pitch angle as a function of the instantaneous frequency (see
ﬁgure 7), the bifurcation diagram of ﬁgure 4 is recovered to
a high degree of accuracy. This suggests that the pitch an-
gle follows ‘adiabatically’ the instantaneous frequency, so that
the apparent growth rate is essentially controlled by the wire
torsion more than the intrinsic dynamics of the instability (at
least far from the transition).

An experiment has been carried out using a wood hoop
0.67 g.cm−3) of mass m = 15.5 g, radius R = 86 mm
10 mm2. The expected frequency threshold is
2.40 Hz (classical hula hoops have Ωc/2π

(ρ0 ≃
and section 4
then Ωc/2π
≃
1 Hz). A simple cotton thread, of length L = 0.68 m and mass
less than 3% of the hoop mass, was ﬁxed to a constant current
motor. The startup timescale for this wire can be estimated
5 s (corresponding to a
from the free oscillation period, τs ≃
10−6 N.m). This wire is far from
torsion constant κ
≃
being torsionless, and during the early stage of the rotation,
torsional energy is stored into the wire. The wire progres-
sively communicates rotation to the hoop, and the ﬂuctations
(due to a varying imposed rotation rate at its upper end, or to
pitch angle variation at the other end) are smoothed down on
a timescale τd.

×

Seen from the side, the hoop rotation appears as Lissajous
ellipses, whose principal axis makes an angle θ with the ver-
tical axis. Pictures acquired from a simple CCD camera (see
ﬁgure 3) allows us to easily measure the pitch angle θ within
1o from these ellipses. The time aperture of the camera may
blur the picture, but facilitate in some case the angle measure-
ment (see for instance picture c).

The measured pitch angles θ, shown in ﬁgure 4, are in
excellent agreement with the exact solution (8), except for
low rotation rate, where non zero angles are measured below
the expected transition. The experimental frequency thresh-
old, obtained by extrapolating the curve down to θ
0, is
0.03) Hz, which agrees within 5% with the

experimental conditions illustrates the robustness of the phe-
nomenon, and makes this experiment easy to work out by un-
dergraduate students. Further experiments can be performed,
e.g. studying the transient phenomena resulting from a small
perturbation. As a suggestion, restrain the point P on the ver-
tical axis when Ω > Ωc by means of a small hook around the
wire. Releasing the hook allows us to measure the growth rate
0. This method can
and to characterize its divergence as ǫ
be hardly achieved with a bead-on-a-hoop apparatus due to its
inherent difﬁcult access.

→

Another motion may compete with the bifurcation de-
scribed in this paper: the hoop can rotate as a whole about
the vertical axis, its center of mass remaining aligned with
the wire. This is the usual motion for the conical pendulum,
which also leads to a supercritical bifurcation with a threshold
g/(L + R).
simply given by the natural frequency ω0 ≃
The conical pendulum motion overcomes the hula hoop mo-
tion for ω0 of order of Ωc, i.e. for a wire length of order of
the hoop radius. Moving away the center of mass from the
vertical axis may allow us to observe the competition between
the two regimes, even for a longer wire.

p

Similar bifurcations as the result of a competition between
centrifugal force and gravity are present in a number of sit-
uations. Spinning plates provides an interesting illustration:
as for the real hula hoop, the motion here is forced by the
precession of the rigid rod rather than its rotation. The im-
posed precession frequency has to overcome the natural fre-
quency for the plate to stand up, and then the horizontal state
is maintained by a parametric oscillation mechanism7. Lasso
roping is another example, where the rigid hoop is replaced
by a deformable loop. Here again the motion is maintained by
the precession of the spoke rather than rotation. As a conse-
quence, the knot on the loop makes the spoke to rotate as well,
so that the cord has to be continuously untwisted at its other
end.

It is worth pointing out that this experiment can be car-
ried out with any rigid body, not necessarily axisymmetric.

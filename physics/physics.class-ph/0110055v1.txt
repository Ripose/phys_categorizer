We show that the stochastic interpretation of Tsallis’ thermostatistics given recently by Beck
[Phys. Rev. Lett 87, 180601 (2001)] leads naturally to a multi-parameter generalization. The
resulting class of distributions is able to ﬁt experimental results which cannot be reproduced within
the Boltzmann’s or Tsallis’ formalism.

Nonextensive statistical mechanics (NESM) intro-
duced by Tsallis [1] has gained a considerable interest
in several ﬁelds of physics because of its capability to de-
scribe a wealth of disparate phenomena (from anomalous
diﬀusion, to turbulent systems, to astrophysical systems,
etc ...) within a single formalism, generalization of the
standard statistical–mechanical one with the addition of
the single free parameter (entropic index) q. Recently it
has been shown how to relate q with the internal micro-
scopic properties of the system under consideration. This
has been done by Wilk and Wlodarczyk [2]: they have
shown that, when q ≥ 1, the NESM canonical distribu-
tion ρq(H, β0) for the system with Hamiltonian H can
be written as an average of the usual Boltzmann-Gibbs
factor over the inverse temperature β:

ρq(H, β0) =

dβ exp(−βH)fq(β, β0)

,

(1)

Z

where fq(β, β0) is a weight function whose meaning is
that of a probability distribution function for β which
is, therefore, no longer a ﬁxed parameter; instead, the
macroscopically visible value is just its average value β0.
Fluctuations in β are related to coherent ﬂuctuations ex-
isting in small parts of the system in respect to the whole
system, due to the existence of long range correlations.
Recently, Beck [3] has been able to give an interpretation
of the ﬂuctuating β as a function of stochastically varying
microscopic variables. In order to recover Tsallis’ results,
Beck was forced to impose some constraints over β or,
equivalently, the microscopic dynamics of the system. In
this paper we show that, following Beck’s approach but
relaxing these constraints, we are able to derive an entire
new class of distributions, which reduce to Tsallis’ dis-
tribution under suitable limits. We will show that some
members of this class are able to reproduce experimen-
tal results which would be outside the reach of Tsallis’
formalism.

To start with, we quote the same example used in
let us set H = u2/2 and suppose that
Beck’s paper:
the generalized velocity u satisﬁes the Langevin equation

˙u = −γu + σL(t)

(2)

with L(t) Gaussian white noise of unit amplitude, σ
strength of the noise, γ friction coeﬃcient. This is the
Brownian particle problem [4]. For this case, it can be
shown that the temperature 1/β is related to the micro-
scopic parameters γ, σ by

β = γ/σ2

.

(3)

Beck shows that Tsallis’s distribution can be recovered if
β is characterized by a χ2 distribution with n degrees of
freedom [5]

(4)

where fq(β, β0) = ˆfn(β, β0) provided that q = 1 + 2/(n +
1). Such a distribution arises if β can be written as a
sum of stochastic variables:

β =

,

n

Xi=1

(5)

with < Xi >= 0 and < X 2
i >= β0/n, so that < β >= β0
0 (2/n). The χ2 distribution is
and < β2 > − < β2 >= β2
a common distribution, occurring in many physical prob-
lems, and is central in the problem of estimating param-
eters from data [6].
Some points are worth stressing at this stage:
(i) The macroscopic parameter β is written in terms of
other parameters more directly related to the microscop-
ical dynamics of the system at hand, just as in Eq. (3).
We just mention another example: in the study of fully
developed turbulence, where u is a local velocity diﬀer-
ence, β = (ετ )−1, with ε spatially averaged energy dissi-
pation rate and τ typical time for the energy transfer.
(ii) It is obvious that, if β is a stochastic variable, a
fortiori the microscopic quantities γ, σ, . . . must also be
stochastic variables, therefore characterized by their own
probability distribution functions (PDFs). (iii) Relations
of the kind (5) impose severe constraints upon the PDFs
of the microscopic variables. For example, to recover Eq.
(4) starting from Eq. (3) there is the trivial choice: γ

χ2-distributed and σ2 a constant; it is diﬃcult (and per-
haps impossible) to devise other distributions which lead
to Eq. (4).
The main idea of this paper is that if β is a function of
some more fundamental stochastic control variables, then
the by far more logical path is the following: to guess sta-
tistical distributions for the microscopic quantities and,
from them, to work out the corresponding distribution
for β. Since β may have inﬁnite functional dependences
from microscopic variables, we can expect the PDF of
β to have a large range of analytical forms, depending
on a large number of parameters [we expect as many of
them as the number of microscopic variables that control
β = β(Y, Z, . . . )].
Some simple rules, however, still allow to drastically re-
duce the class of likely distributions. First, although the
PDF for each of the variables Y, Z, . . .
, may be arbi-
trary, the same reasoning of Eqns (4,5) still holds: that is,
the χ2 distribution for each variable is a very convenient
choice. For example, the χ2 distribution can tranform
into a delta distribution, thus allowing for well deter-
ministic, non–stochastic quantities in the limit n → ∞.
Hence, we will suppose all the stochastic variables to be
χ2-distributed, possibly with diﬀerent degrees of free-
dom.
In second place, a simplicity principle suggests
that the most frequently occurring cases should be those
where β is some simple combination of a small number
of variables. Some examples are given in the above ex-
pressions (e.g., Eq. 3). The simplest function of all is the
sum of stochastic variables: β = Y + Z + ... . However,
with the previous choice for the PDFs of Y, Z, . . . , it is
possible to show that it is a trivial case, since it reduces
to a χ2 distribution [5]. The next nontrivial cases, thus,
are those involving products and ratios of one or two con-
trol variables: Y × Z, Y /Z , 1/(Y Z), . . . .
Our aim now is to compute a few examples of PDFs of β
and to compare the results with the Tsallis’ formalism.
We will do the computation for the case of β ratio of
two stochastic variables: β = Y /Z. This is particularly
convenient since: (i) it generalizes the example given by
Beck (Eq. 3) ; (ii) it is a particular case of β = 1/(ετ ),
when Y and either ε or τ are constants.
The probability distribution function for the two χ2 in-
dependent variables Y , Z of degree n, m respectively, is

main result of the work, since the statistical properties of
the system are determined through the two-parameters

The main feature of Eq. (7) is that the exponential term
of Eq.
(4) has disappeared, replaced by a power-law
term. One should expect this term to depress high-energy
tails in Eq. (8). In order to have an insight on the trends
of Eq. (7), let us consider some interesting limits. First
of all, we observe that, in the limit m → ∞,

We recover the χ2 distribution (Eq. 4) since,
in the
limit of inﬁnite degrees of freedom, the distribution for Z
shrinks to a delta distribution, so we are actually dealing
with just one stochastic variable, Y . It is completely new
the limit n → ∞ (that is, we are computing the PDF of
the variable 1/Z), for which we get:

In order to give a visual insight, we plot in Fig. 1 some
examples of these distributions. The qualitative shape
is rather similar. The occupations factors are computed
through eq.

where K is the modiﬁed Bessel function of order m/2 and
erfc is the complementary error function: erfc = 1 - erf.
The general case of arbitrary n, m can be explicitly writ-
ten down, but it is not revealing since it involves complex
combinations of hypergeometric function, diﬃcult to vi-
sualize. We plot in Fig. 2 the standard Boltzmann–Gibbs
factor together with the curves (11). In general, the new
distributions are characterized by tails intermediate be-
tween Boltzmann’s and Tsallis’ statistics. We can obtain

2 ) or
Notice that the function K yields a typical exp(−cH
exp(−c′|u|) dependence. Such a law cannot be recovered
within the Tsallis’ formalism, which predicts power-law
dependences. Therefore we take it as a signature of this
new class of functions.
It may be of interest to notice
that the dependence on |u| comes from the variable at
the denominator of β, while the numerator provides a
dependence on u2. In the general case, both |u| and u2
terms do appear.
The question arises obviously if such distributions do ex-
ist in nature. We are interested in ﬂuctuations of some
quantity: for independent ﬂuctuations, the Central Limit
Theorem predicts a Gaussian PDF. If departures from
Gaussianity are described in terms of Tsallis’ statistics,
only PDFs with power–law asymptotics may be included.
On the basis of what told before, we must look for PDFs
with exponential tails. Actually, in literature are pre-
sented several examples of quantities whose PDFs are
(at least on some ranges) exponential. We brieﬂy men-
tion the numerical computation of the velocity distribu-
tion function solution of the Enskog–Boltzmann equation
for a granular gas [7]; other hints come from calcula-
tions of the large-scale probability density distribution
in astrophysics [8] and from the numerical simulation of
stresses in sheared granular materials [9]. A ﬁeld where
several well documented examples can be found is the
study of turbulence in ﬂuids. We refer in particular to
papers [10, 11, 12, 13]). The quantity we are interested
in here is the PDF of the velocity diﬀerence between two
spatial points. It is found both experimentally and nu-
merically that this quantity shows an exponential tail.
In particular, in paper [10] the departure from a Gaus-
sian form is interpreted within a formalism very close to
ours, where the average (8) is done using their equivalent
of ˆfn,m(β, β0) given by a log-normal function [see their
equations (3.1-3.4)]. The paper [12], furthermore, shows
that the tails of this PDF can smoothly vary between
the Cauchy form (which is a particular kind of Tsallis’
distribution) to Gaussian form passing through the expo-
nential form, by varying a few control parameters. This
is strikingly reminiscent of varying n, m parameters in
our formalism.
In more detail, we can quote two experimental stud-
ies from fusion plasma physics:
in the ﬁrst paper [14]
it is presented a study of the density ﬂuctuations ex-
isting in a thermonuclear fusion device. The time be-
havior of the electron density ne close to the bound-
ary of the device was measured with high sampling fre-
quency, thus allowing to compute the PDF of the ﬂuc-
tuation ˜ne = ne− < ne >. It was found that the curve
is highly asymmetrical, with the negative wing approxi-
mately gaussian, and the positive one nearly exponential.
In Fig. 3 we ﬁt the experimental data with both Tsallis’
and our curve, showing that the former curve cannot ﬁt
the tail of the experimental distribution. Rather closely
related, we mention a second paper, dealing with a statis-

tials: P (X) ≈ exp (−b|X|α). The parameter α is func-
tion of the time scale, varying between 1 (exponential
distribution) and 2 (Gaussian distribution).
In Fig. 4
the case closest to an exponential is shown.

We think we have given in this work constructive ev-
idence of the existence of generalized nonextensive dis-
tributions. The very simple PDFs we have computed,
seemingly gave us the tools to describe complicated phe-
nomena.
A crucial point is the choice of the microscopic variables,
since one could always choose varying deﬁnitions for them
so as to identify several diﬀerent cases within the same
classes of functions. Therefore, work in this direction
should: (i) either show that trivial redeﬁnitions of vari-
ables are not important for the ﬁnal result, (ii) or ﬁnd
that some sets of variables are preferred with respect to
all the others.

Dissipative Lagrangians and Hamiltonians having Coulomb, visous and quadrati damping,

together with gravitational and elasti terms are presented for a formalism that preserves the

Hamiltonian as a onstant of the motion. Their derivations are also shown. The resulting

L

H

's and

's may prove useful in exploring new types of damped quantum systems.

Of the Lagrange-Hamiltonian formalisms that inorporate fritional fores, the formulation

by Shuh [1℄ is losely analagous to a onservative system. This approah has had a number of

advantages, espeially for desribing quantum systems. As expeted, the Lagrangian L produes
the orret equation of motion. The Hamiltonian H is a onstant of the motion. H also has

†

a physial interpretation of being the total energy for the system.

The problem of shrinking

Heisenberg unertainty, often seen with anonial attempts at dissipative quantization [1, 2, 3, 4℄,

an be resolved. In addition, the range of andidates for H is greatly narrowed from an in(cid:28)nite

set of possibilities, e.g.

[5, 6℄. For onveniene, the formalism developed by Shuh will be

referred to as

˜Hexp , where exp represents an expanding oordinate spae.

The existene of

˜Hexp does not neessarily rule out the usefulness of alternate forms. Shuh
[2, 3℄ has also shown that well known formalisms that do not preserve H as a onstant of the
˜Hexp via anonial

motion suh as Caldirola [7℄ and Kanai [8℄, an be onverted to and from

transformation. There is a similar relationship for the non-linear Shrödinger equation, (NLSE),

[2, 3℄. These other formalisms and

˜Hexp are losely related beause they share similar non-

anonial transformations that onnet the physial and transformed oordinate spaes.

Given its promising harateristis, new instanes are presented to show that the

˜Hexp for-

malism an be broadened to inlude additional ombinations of frition and potential. Some of

the more important details onerning

To obtain L's and H 's that have the desired properties, it is neessary to determine relations

that onnet the physial spae oordinate q , to a transformed Q spae [1℄,

˜Hexp are disussed brie(cid:29)y.

Q = F (q, t, ξ0, ξ1, . . . , φ0, φ1, . . .)

(1)

where t is time and ξi and φi are the oe(cid:30)ients of frition and potential. Note that within
Q-spae expliit time dependene is absent.

Depending on the initial onditions that are spei(cid:28)ed.

The resulting L's and H 's for a prospetive system with fritional fores must also satisfy a

set of formalisi rules [1℄ whih are listed below.

1. All L( ˙q, q, t)'s, L( ˙Q, Q)'s, H(p, q, t)'s, and H(P, Q)'s have the units of energy.

2. The L for the system has an invariane property whereby both δL( ˙q, q, t) = 0 and δL( ˙Q, Q)

= 0 orretly produe the physial spae equation of motion.

‡

3. The physial and transformed momenta p and P are de(cid:28)ned as p = m ˙q and P = m ˙Q
respetively. In the absene of expressed dissipative fores, as in Q-spae, P = ∂L( ˙Q,Q)
also holds. If frition is expressed expliitly, as in real spae, p 6= ∂L( ˙q,q,t)

∂ ˙Q

in general!

∂ ˙q

4. H(P, Q) is found via the Lengendre transform H = P ˙Q − L where neither L = L( ˙Q, Q)
nor H(P, Q) ontain t expliitly. If there is expliit time dependene in the onnetion
§
between Q and q , H(p, q, t) 6= p ˙q − L( ˙q, q, t)!

5. The H(p, q, t) that is obtained from H(P, Q) is a onstant of the motion and an be made

equal to the initial energy.

6. As the oe(cid:30)ients for frition or potentials are made to vanish, Q,

˙Q, P , L( ˙q, q, t), L( ˙Q, Q),

H(p, q, t) and H(P, Q) ollapse smoothly to the expeted simpler forms.

7. Q,

˙Q as well as q , ˙q are related through simple di(cid:27)erentiation with respet to time:

˙Q = dQ
dt ;

˙q = dq
dt .

Previously derived examples for

Solving the assoiated equation of motion for p(t) and q(t) and inserting the results bak into
H(p, q, t), shows that H(p, q, t) is a onstant of the motion. H(p, q, t) is also equal to the initial
energy under the right inital onditions, suh as q0 = 0 or ˙q0 = 0 for example.

Q's, L's and H 's that satisfy onditions 1-7 for a partile moving in a onstant gravity (cid:28)eld

or against frition for the lowest powers of veloity are shown in tables 1-a and 1-b.

The entries of table 1 have additional noteworthy harateristis. Eah q -spae L and H

ontains a dimensionless expansion fator

Z

(2)

where G is the right hand part of the generi di(cid:27)erential equation, ¨q = G( ˙q, q, t). Conservative

potentials that exist in physial spae are required by ondition 6 to be expliity expressed

within L( ˙Q, Q) and H(P, Q) as well. Some ases, like the visous example, require potential-like
˜Hexp to be ful(cid:28)lled. However,

in L( ˙Q, Q) and H(P, Q) for the onditions of

γ

2

terms suh as

4 Q2

for the quadratially damped ase, no suh terms are needed. As will be seen, other fritional

systems also require "pseudopotentials" that have the form f (Q, ξ0, ξ1, . . . , φ0, φ1, . . .) where Q
is the transformed position and ξi and φi are the relevant oe(cid:30)ients of frition and potential.
The tables 2-a and 2-b list the Q's, L's and H 's derived for various ombinations of frition
and potential. The symbol α is used to represent gravity g or dry frition µ that opposes the
motion. Note that eah L( ˙Q, Q) and H(P, Q) ontains some form of pseudopotental.

It is readily demonstrated that both δL( ˙q, q, t) = 0 and δL( ˙Q, Q) = 0 produe the orret
equations of motion. Solving for ˙q(t) and q(t) and inserting the results bak into H(p, q, t), also
shows that the H(p, q, t)'s are onstants of the motion. Under requisite initial onditions, H is

equal to the initial energy as well. Other ombinations are also possible.

There are general harateristis of solutions that are observed. The ombination of two or

more L( ˙q, q, t)'s with di(cid:27)ering frition terms results in their respetive expansion fators being
multiplied together [5, 9, 10℄. The Q-spae L for a ombination inludes the potentials and
pseudopotentials of the simpler L's. For ombinations of µ or g with a form that has visous
frition, the Q-de(cid:28)nition ontains an additonal f (t) that is to be determined.

As has been mentioned, pseudopotential funtions in Q-spae are seen to be important in
(cid:28)nding solutions to dissiptive L's and H 's in the Shuh formalism, but there is not yet a proved

method for their determination. The urrent examples follow the provisional rule that if suh

a funtion an be found whih satis(cid:28)es onditions 1-7, then it is inluded. In some ases, only

one simple possiblity exists that has the orret units, i.e. energy. For the free quadradially

damped partile there evidently are none. In the ase of the quadratially damped osillator, a

pseudopotential may be determined by integrating the equation of motion Q-spae. Examples are
presented to illustrate in more detail how the Q de(cid:28)nitions and subsequent L and H ombinations

were onstruted.

Example 1: ¨q + γ ˙q + α = 0. The ansatz Q-de(cid:28)nition is taken to be:

Q = q exp(

t) + f (t)

γ
2

Sine the invariane requirement of ondition 2 means that the L must produe the orret
equation of motion regardless of whether it is in Q or q spae, Q-spae may be used, whih is
more onvenient. An initial L( ˙Q, Q) is formed from the terms that orrespond to eah individual

fritional oe(cid:30)ient and potential as listed in table 1a:

δL( ˙Q, Q) = 0 is alulated:

L( ˙Q, Q) =

( ˙Q2 +

Q2 − 2αQ)

The Q above is di(cid:27)erentiated to (cid:28)nd
to q -spae: The result is:

The following di(cid:27)erential equation in f must therefore be solved:

It is possible to set up a di(cid:27)erential

Q = f exp(bq);

˙Q = ˙f exp(bq) + bf ˙q exp(bq) = ˙q exp(bq)

(11)

The resulting di(cid:27)erential equation is:

The solution for f in terms of q is then:

A valid Q de(cid:28)nition is therefore:

The method above works for quadrati frition, but there is evidently no urrent tehnique for

determining Q de(cid:28)nitions of orders ˙q3

and higher.

The L( ˙q, q, t) that is obtained for Example 3 and shown in table 1-b is essentially the same as

what is found in Havas [9℄, Tartaglia [10℄ and Razavy [4℄. Sine time does not appear expliitly,

the L's still math even if potentials are inluded [10℄. However,

˜Hexp requires by onditions 3

and 5 that a system in real spae be based on the kineti momentum as opposed to the onjugate

momentum. Beause the resulting H(p, q, t) for this example uses p = m ˙q instead of p = ∂L

The expansion fator is divided out and the desired result is on(cid:28)rmed with no other steps

The δL( ˙Q, Q) is alulated:

Converting the di(cid:27)erential equation to q -spae:

δL( ˙Q, Q) =

(2 ¨Q) = 0

(¨q + b ˙q2) exp(bq) = 0

It is lear that an ω2q exp(bq) term is required to omplete the equation of motion. Even

though frition is present, there is no expliit time dependene. It is possible to work bakward,

onverting the needed term to a funtion of Q by using the Q-de(cid:28)nition.

ω2q exp(bq) =

ln(bQ + 1)(bQ + 1)

The right hand side of equation (23) above is integrated to omplete the desired L( ˙Q, Q) whih

results in the ompliated looking expression at the bottom of the third olumn in Table 2a.

By expanding these terms into a power series it is seen that the onservative potential ω2Q2
present. A onstant − ω

2b2 has also been added to satisfy ondition 6. For ¨q + b ˙q2 + α = 0 the

Conlusion

It is possible to onstrut Lagrangians and Hamiltonians with additional ombinations of

frition and potential terms that are onsistent with a previously published Lagrange-Hamilton

formalism for dissipative systems. The resultant L's and H 's o(cid:27)er new possibilities for anonial

quantizations of fritional systems. Other areas of future study inlude the determination of a

general method for (cid:28)nding Q de(cid:28)nitions for higher order fritional ases. The physial signif-

iane of the L's and H 's, suh as may exist, remains to be ompletely explained. A proof of
uniqueness for L's and H 's may require additional, as yet unde(cid:28)ned onditions to ensure unique

physial interpretations.

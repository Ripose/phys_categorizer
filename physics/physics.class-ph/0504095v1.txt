Abstract

We generalise a recent derivation of the relativistic expressions for momentum

and kinetic energy from the one-dimensional to the three-dimensional case.

PACS: 03.30.+p; 01.40.-d; 01.55.+b
Keywords: Relativistic energy; relativistic momentum; relativistic dynamics.

1 Introduction

We have recently shown [1] how to construct, given a velocity composition law, the expres-
sions of kinetic energy, momentum, the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian for a particle,
in a general mechanical theory satisfying the principle of relativity, and in which elastic
collisions between asymptotically free particles exist. For reasons explained in that paper,
the discussion in reference [1] was restricted to the case of one spatial dimension only. In
the present article we extend the treatment to three dimensions.

Let us brieﬂy review the key elements upon which the derivation in reference [1]
is based. The starting point is the deﬁnition of kinetic energy for a particle, as a scalar
quantity whose change equals the work done on the particle. Mathematically, this amounts
to requiring the validity of the fundamental relation

dT (u) = u · dp(u) ,

(1.1)

where T (u) and p(u) are, respectively, the kinetic energy and the momentum of a particle
with velocity u. For a system of non-interacting particles, kinetic energy is then necessar-
ily additive, since work is, so one can easily write down a formula that expresses energy
conservation during an elastic collision. On requiring that this holds in an arbitrary iner-
tial frame, it follows that another quantity is conserved, in addition to energy — a vector
one, that we identify with momentum. As we shall see, this quantity is linked to kinetic
energy through a simple equation containing a matrix of functions ϕij (the indices i and

j run from 1 to 3), which is uniquely determined by the composition law for velocities.
This, together with equation (1.1) above, allows one to ﬁnd the explicit dependence of
both energy and momentum on velocity.

We begin by collecting, in the next section, some results concerning the velocity com-
position law in three dimensions. Section 3 contains the general outline of the method,
which is then applied in section 4 to the cases of Galilean and Einstein’s dynamics. A
short summary of the results, together with an assessment about their suitability from a
pedagogical point of view, is given in section 5. The Appendix contains two mathematical
relations that are not used in the body of the paper, but that might nevertheless turn out
to be useful in further possible developments.

2 Kinematical preliminaries

Suppose that a particle moves with velocity u with respect to a reference frame K. If K
moves with velocity v with respect to another reference frame K, the particle velocity ¯u
with respect to K is given by some composition law

¯u = Φ(u, v) .

(It is important to appreciate that this relation contains vectors belonging to two diﬀerent
spaces. Not only are the basis used to write the vectors v and ¯u, and the vector u,
diﬀerent; they even span diﬀerent rest spaces, namely those of K and K, respectively.)
The relativity principle requires that (2.1) give the composition law of a group, i.e., that:

Φ(u, 0) = Φ(0, u) = u , ∀u ;

∀u, ∃u′

such that Φ(u, u′

) = Φ(u′

, u) = u ;

Φ(Φ(u, v), w) = Φ(u, Φ(v, w)) , ∀u, v, w .

Note that, although in the Galilean case,

Φ(u, v) = u + v ,

the composition law is commutative, this is not the case in general, unless velocities are
collinear. For example, the relativistic law [2]

Φ(u, v) =

1 + u · v/c2

where, as usual,

From the composition law (2.1) one can deﬁne a matrix whose components are, in

Cartesian bases,

Equation (2.3) then imposes that ϕij(0) = δij. In fact, for the Galilean composition law
(2.5), we have ϕij(u) = δij for all u. On the other hand, in the relativistic case (2.6),

ϕij(u) = δij −

3 General analysis

Let T (u) be the kinetic energy of a particle with velocity u in an inertial frame K. During
an elastic collision between two particles, energy conservation requires that

T1(u1) + T2(u2) = T1(u′

1) + T2(u′

2) .

(3.1)

(Of course, the kinetic energy will also depend on the particle mass; we keep track of this
dependence with the indices 1 and 2 on T .)

With respect to another inertial frame K, in which K moves with velocity v, the
2, v).

particles velocities are ¯u1 = Φ(u1, v), ¯u2 = Φ(u2, v), ¯u′
Conservation of energy in K then implies

1, v), and ¯u′

1 = Φ(u′

2 = Φ(u′

T1( ¯u1) + T2( ¯u2) = T1( ¯u′

1) + T2( ¯u′

2) ,

where we have used the same functions T1 and T2 as in (3.1), because of the relativity
principle.

The expansion of T ( ¯u) around v = 0 is1

T ( ¯u) = T (u) + vi ϕij(u)

∂T (u)
∂uj

+ O(v2) .

Doing this for each term in equation (3.2), then using equation (3.1) and considering the
terms of ﬁrst order in v, we ﬁnd the following additional conservation law:
∂T2(u′

∂uj

∂T1(u′

= ϕij(u′
1)

+ ϕij(u′
2)

+ ϕij(u2)

ϕij(u1)

(3.4)

.

Thus, one arrives at the conclusion that the vector p(u), whose components are

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.5)

pi(u) = ϕij(u)

∂T (u)
∂uj

,

is conserved during a collision, in addition to energy. In the one-dimensional case, this
quantity can be identiﬁed with linear momentum [1], and we suggest doing the same in
three dimensions.2 Note that, with this deﬁnition, linear momentum turns out to be a
one-form rather than a vector, which is very satisfactory from a formal point of view.

1We adopt the convention of summing over repeated indices.
2Actually, the most general conserved quantity has the form

λij ϕjk(u)

+ µi T (u) + νi ,

∂T (u)
∂uk

where λij , µi and νi are a tensor and two vectors that do not depend on u. The simplest choice λij = δij,
µi = νi = 0 corresponds to the requirement that space be isotropic, and is the one which leads to the
standard expressions for T (u) and p(u).

If we know the function T (u), we can ﬁnd p. If we do not already know T (u), we can
deﬁne it by requiring that it satisﬁes the fundamental relation (1.1), which expresses the
equality between the work done on the particle and the variation of its kinetic energy [1].
On rewriting the diﬀerentials dT and dp in (1.1) in terms of dui one gets

Taken together, equations (3.5) and (3.6) allow one to determine T (u). Using again (3.5),
one can then ﬁnd p(u).

The free particle Lagrangian must satisfy the relation

(3.8)

Using equation (3.5), we obtain

Obviously, it is only for ϕij = δij (i.e., in Newtonian dynamics) that L = T + const — a
feature already emphasised in reference [1].

Turning now to the Hamiltonian, we need only notice that (3.6) gives, basically, half of
Hamilton’s equations of motion for a system with Hamiltonian H(p) = T (u(p)) + const.
Indeed,

∂T (u)
∂uj
or, symbolically, u = ∇pH. This allows us to identify H(p) with T (u(p)), up to an
additive p-independent constant.

4 Isotropy

The previous discussion was general, in the sense that it was based only on the principle
of relativity and on the hypothesis of space homogeneity (implicit in our use of inertial
systems). With the further requirement that space be isotropic, one can restrict ϕij(u)
to having the functional form

ϕij(u) = δij + f (u) ui uj ,

(4.1)

where f is an arbitrary function of the magnitude u of u. This follows immediately by
considering that no other vector except u can be used in writing ϕij. In fact, even the
class (4.1) is too wide, because relativity, homogeneity, and isotropy together, force f to
be a constant.3 Simple physical considerations [4] then require that such a constant be
non-positive, so we shall write from now on

(4.2)
3Since f depends only on the magnitude u of the velocity, this result can be established simply by

ϕij(u) = δij − K ui uj ,

comparison with the one-dimensional case [1, 3].

where K ≥ 0. The cases K = 0 and K = 1/c2 correspond to the Galilei and Einstein
composition law.

From equation (3.6) we ﬁnd

where A is an arbitrary constant. By a further integration we ﬁnd, for K 6= 0,

while, for K = 0,

T (u) =

A/K
(1 − K u2)

1/2 + B ;

T (u) = A u2 + B .

In both cases, B is a further integration constant. On requiring that T (0) = 0, we can
write B in terms of A, which can then be expressed using the more familiar parameter m
— the particle mass. We thus obtain, for K 6= 0,

T (u) =

m/K
(1 − K u2)

1/2 − m/K ;

and, for K = 0,

Note that (4.11) coincides with the limit of (4.10) for K → 0. For K = 1/c2 one recovers

It is then a straightforward exercise to ﬁnd the usual expressions for momentum, the
Lagrangian, and the Hamiltonian, using equations (3.5), (3.8), and the remarks at the
end of section 3. The results are the same as in the one-dimensional case, so we do not
list them here.

In closing this section, we note that the calculations can be simpliﬁed by arguing that
T (u) can only be a function of u, and that p(u) must be of the form p(u) = α(u)u, with
α an unspeciﬁed function of u. However, we have preferred not to rely on these results,
because they need not be derived separately, but are actually consequences of equations
(3.5), (3.6), and (4.2).

5 Conclusions

In this paper we have extended the derivation of relativistic energy and momentum given
in [1], from one to three dimensions. Although nothing changes in the results, it is obvious
that the discussion is not as elementary as for the one-dimensional case, since it requires
some familiarity with multivariable calculus. Hence, this material is not suitable for an
introductory course, contrary to what happens for the treatment in reference [1]. It can,
however, be presented in a standard course on analytical mechanics, at the level, e.g., of
reference [5]. Indeed, we believe that students would beneﬁt from being exposed to this
approach, which relies on a very small number of physical hypotheses, and has therefore
the advantage of being logically very simple.

Appendix: Diﬀerential constraints

We present two mathematical relations — equations (A.1) and (A.4) below — that have
not been used in the body of the article, but that nevertheless are somewhat interest-
ing by their own, since they represent diﬀerential constraints on momentum and on the
Hamiltonian.

Replacing (3.6) into (3.5), one arrives at a single equation for p(u):

On deﬁning ψij(u) as the components of the inverse matrix of the ϕij(u), that is ψij ϕjk =
δik, equation (A.1) can be rewritten as

Taking now the second derivative of Hamilton’s equations (3.9) we get

pi(u) = ϕij(u)

Abstract

It is shown that acceleration-dependent electromagnetic self-interaction eﬀects are responsible for the
inertia and the gravitational interaction of the classical electron. The objections against regarding the
entire electron mass as electromagnetic are answered. It is also shown that the established by the classical
electromagnetic mass theory fact that at least part of the inertia and the inertial mass of every charged
particle is electromagnetic in origin implies that part of a charged particle’s passive and active gravitational
mass is also electromagnetic in origin. These unnoticed consequences of the electromagnetic mass theory
form the basis for a deeper understanding of the nature of both inertia and gravitation.

Introduction

The nature of inertia and gravitation has been an outstanding puzzle for centuries. Even now, at the end of the
twentieth century, the situation is the same - ”the origin and nature of inertial forces... can be considered as an
unsolved mystery in modern physics. It still sits, like Banco’s ghost, at any banquet of natural philosophers”
[1]. Our understanding of gravitation can be described in the same way since general relativity added very
little to our understanding of the mechanism of gravitational interaction. The present view of gravitation as
manifestation of spacetime curvature simply shifts the problem to the curvature of spacetime whose nature
remains a mystery.

In the last quarter of the nineteen century two very diﬀerent approaches to inertia were put forward. In 1881
Thomson [2] ﬁrst realized that a charged particle was more resistant to being accelerated than an otherwise
identical neutral particle and conjectured that inertia can be reduced to electromagnetism. Due mostly to the
works of Heaviside [3], Searle [4], Lorentz [5, 6], Poincar´e [7, 8], Abraham [9], Fermi [10, 11], Mandel [12],
Wilson [13], Pryce [14], Kwal [15] and Rohrlich [16, 17] this conjecture was developed into what is now known
as the classical electromagnetic mass theory of the electron in which inertia is a local phenomenon originating
from the interaction of the electron with its own electromagnetic ﬁeld [18]. Around 1883 Mach [20] argued that
inertia was caused by all the matter in the Universe (no matter how distant it may be) thus assuming that the
local property of inertia had a non-local cause. There have been two recent attempts to address the nature
of inertia. In 1994 Haisch, Rueda and Puthoﬀ published a paper [21] (see also [22] and [23]) in which they
regarded inertia as a zero-point-ﬁeld Lorentz force. A model of gravitation which is also zero-point-ﬁeld-based
In 1995 Vigier [1]
was proposed by Sakharov [24] in 1968 and further developed by Puthoﬀ [25] in 1989.
considered inertia a local particle-vacuum interaction in the framework of the Einstein - de Broglie - Bohm
interpretation of quantum mechanics.

In this paper we shall show that an opportunity to reveal the nature of inertia and gravitation on the bases
of the classical electromagnetic mass theory and general relativity may have been missed in the ﬁrst quarter of
this century. It has not been noticed that the electromagnetic mass theory has some important consequences
when the principle of equivalence is taken into account. It is now an established fact from this theory that at
least part of the inertia and the inertial mass of every charged particle is electromagnetic in origin. As Feynman

1

put it: ”There is deﬁnite experimental evidence of the existence of electromagnetic inertia - there is evidence
that some of the mass of charged particles is electromagnetic in origin” [26, p. 28-10]. Nevertheless the classical
electromagnetic mass theory has been (with few exceptions) unexplainably ignored [27]. As a result it has not
been realized that if part of the inertial mass of a charged particle is electromagnetic, it follows according to
the principle of equivalence that part of the passive gravitational mass of that particle is also electromagnetic
in origin. And while the origin of the inertial electromagnetic mass is explained by the electromagnetic mass
theory, the issue of the origin of the passive gravitational electromagnetic mass constitutes an open question
which needs to be addressed (the equivalence principle does not provide any insight into what causes the passive
gravitational electromagnetic mass of charged particles). A second important issue which the electromagnetic
mass theory raises involves the active gravitational mass. As it is believed that the inertial mass, the passive
gravitational and the active gravitational mass of a particle are all equal, and since part of the inertial and the
passive gravitational mass of a charged particle is electromagnetic in origin, it follows that part of the particle’s
active gravitational mass is also electromagnetic originating from the particle’s charge. Therefore it is the
charge that is partly responsible for the particle’s gravity. These are the major unnoticed consequences of the
electromagnetic mass theory which may have far reaching implications for our understanding of the nature of
inertia and gravitation.

As there is no accepted quantum model of the electron structure a thorough analysis of the electron
electromagnetic mass in quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics is not possible. That is why the
approach of Abraham [9] and Lorentz [6] considering the electron charge distributed on the surface shell of a
small sphere is followed here and the classical electron is meant throughout the paper [28]. In the paper we shall
address two questions: (i) Can both inertia and gravitation (and therefore the inertial and gravitational mass)
of the classical electron be fully explained by the electromagnetic mass theory? and (ii) Can the electromagnetic
mass theory provide any further insight into the nature of mass, inertia, and gravitation of all matter?

The electromagnetic mass of the electron can be calculated by three independent methods [30]: (i) energy-
derived electromagnetic mass mU = U/c2, where U is the ﬁeld energy of the electron at rest, (ii) momentum-
derived electromagnetic mass mp = p/v, where p is the ﬁeld momentum when the electron is moving at speed
v, and (iii) self-force-derived electromagnetic mass ms = Fs/a, where Fs is the self-force acting on the electron
when it has an acceleration a.

There have been three reasons for not regarding the entire mass of the electron and the other charged
particles as electromagnetic: (i) there is a factor of 4/3 (instead of unity) which appears in the momentum-
derived and the self-force-derived electromagnetic mass (the energy-derived electromagnetic mass is equal to
the electron mass), (ii) since the diﬀerent volume elements of the classical electron whose charge is uniformly
distributed on the surface shell of a sphere (representing the electron) repel one another it is not clear what
keeps the electron stable, and (iii) if the electromagnetic interaction is responsible for part of a charged particle’s
mass it is quite natural to expect that the weak and strong interactions contribute to its mass as well.

Feynman considered the 4/3 factor in the electromagnetic mass a serious problem since it made the elec-
tromagnetic mass theory (yielding an incorrect relation between energy and momentum due to the 4/3 factor)
inconsistent with relativity: ”It is therefore impossible to get all the mass to be electromagnetic in the way we
hoped. It is not a legal theory if we have nothing but electrodynamics” [26, p. 28-4]. It seems he was unaware
that the 4/3 factor which appears in the momentum-derived electromagnetic mass had been accounted for in
the works of Mandel [12], Wilson [13], Pryce [14], Kwal [15], and Rohrlich [16] (all of them removed that factor
independently from one another). The self-force-derived electromagnetic mass has been the most diﬃcult to
deal with, persistently yielding the factor of 4/3. By a covariant application of Hamilton principle in 1922 Fermi
[10] ﬁrst removed the 4/3 factor from the self-force as described in an inertial reference frame I. However, the
factor of 4/3 has remained in the self-force in the case of an electron at rest in an accelerated frame N a and in
a frame N g on the Earth’s surface, described in N a and N g, respectively. Here we shall see how that factor is
accounted for in N a and N g. After the appearance of the 4/3 factor has been explained the electromagnetic
mass theory of the classical electron becomes consistent with relativity and the electron electromagnetic mass
coincides with its entire mass.

Since its origin a century ago the electromagnetic mass theory of the electron has not been able to explain
why the electron is stable (what holds its charge together). This failure has been seen as an explanation of the
presence of the 4/3 factor and has been used as evidence against regarding its entire mass as electromagnetic.
It has been assumed that part of the electron mass (regarded as mechanical) originates from forces (known
as the Poincar´e stresses [7], [8]) holding the electron charge together and that it is this mechanical mass that
compensates the 4/3 factor (reducing the electron mass from (4/3) m to m). However, the 4/3 factor turned

2

out to be an error in the calculations of the momentum-derived electromagnetic mass as shown by Mandel [12],
Wilson [13], Pryce [14], Kwal [15], and Rohrlich [16, 17]. As there remained nothing to be compensated (in
terms of mass) if there were some unknown attraction forces (the Poincar´e stresses) responsible for holding the
electron charge together, their negative contribution to the electron mass would result in reducing it from m to
(2/3) m. Obviously there are two options in such a situation - either to seek what this time compensates the
negative contribution of the Poincar´e stresses to the mass or to assume that the hypothesis of their existence
was not necessary in the ﬁrst place (especially after it turned out that the 4/3 factor does not need to be
compensated since it was just an error). An argument supporting the latter option is the fact that if there
existed a real problem with the stability of the electron, the hypothesis of the Poincar´e stresses should be
needed to balance the mutual repulsion of the volume elements of an electron at rest in its rest frame as well.
This, however, is not the case since there is no 4/3 factor problem in the energy-derived electromagnetic mass
of the electron in that case which must be accounted for. On the other hand, the stability problem (through
the 4/3 factor) does not show up in the calculations of the self-force either. As Fermi [10] showed and as we
shall see here the Poincar´e stresses are not needed for the derivation of the self-force-derived electromagnetic
mass since the 4/3 factor which was present in previous derivations of the self-force also turned out to be an
error. This implies that there is no real problem with the stability of the electron. We do not know why. Only
a future quantum-mechanical model of the electron itself (not its state) may answer this question (there exists
at least one quantum-mechanical model of the electron structure that explains why the repulsion ”within”
the electron does not need to be balanced [29]). What we do know, however, is that if there were a stability
problem it would inevitably show up in all the calculations of the energy-derived, momentum-derived, and
self-force-derived electromagnetic mass which is not the case.

The third objection against regarding the entire mass as electromagnetic in origin does not apply to the
electron [31]. Even if we assume that the strong and weak interactions contribute to the mass, the mass of
a free (not interacting with other particles) electron is not aﬀected for two reasons: (i) the electron does not
participate in strong interactions, and (ii) a free electron does not participate in any weak interactions either
(only the volume elements of its charge interact electromagnetically).

Therefore, in the case of the classical electron all objections against regarding its mass as entirely electro-
magnetic in origin are answered. We shall see that not only its inertial mass is electromagnetic, but both its
passive gravitational and active gravitational masses are electromagnetic as well. This in turn fully explains
the behavior of an electron in free space and on the Earth, thus providing answers to the following fundamental
questions: (i) Why does an electron moving with uniform velocity not resist its motion (since Galileo this has
been a postulate)? (ii) Why does an accelerating electron resist its acceleration? (iii) Why does an electron
falling toward the Earth’s surface not resist its acceleration? (iv) Why does an electron on the Earth’s surface
resist being prevented from falling?

In Section 2 the anisotropic speed of light in non-inertial reference frames is calculated and is shown that
the inertia and gravitation of the electron (including the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass) are
fully and consistently accounted for due to the electromagnetic origin of its inertial and gravitational mass.

The issue of whether all the mass is electromagnetic in origin is discussed in Section 3. An argument that

it is unlikely for the strong interaction to contribute to the mass is also considered there.

Section 4 demonstrates that not only the gravitational attraction and inertia of the electron are fully
explained by the electromagnetic mass theory but the inertia and gravitation of all matter can be accounted
for as well if it is assumed that all the mass is electromagnetic in origin which implies that there should exist
no elementary neutral particles (with non-zero rest mass) in nature. Section 4 also deals with two corollaries
of the electromagnetic mass theory - one implying that the Riemannian geometry describes not a curved but
an anisotropic spacetime and the other demonstrating that the anisotropy of spacetime around a massive body
originates from the elementary charges comprising the body.

Inertia and Gravitation of the Classical Electron Originate from
Small Acceleration-Dependent Electromagnetic Self-Interaction
Eﬀects

When the mutual repulsion of the volume elements of a classical electron moving with constant velocity is
described in an inertial frame I there is no net force acting on the electron since all repulsion forces cancel

3

out exactly. If, however, the electron is accelerated (still described in I) the repulsion of its volume elements
becomes unbalanced and as a result it experiences a net self-force which resists its acceleration [26, p. 28-5] -
this resistance is known as inertia. More generally, the resultant self-force that acts on the electron as a whole
and opposes its acceleration can be regarded as originating from the interaction of its charge with its own
electric ﬁeld.

Here we shall not follow the standard approach to calculating the self-force [32]-[35] which describes the
electron’s motion in an inertial frame I. Instead, all calculations will be carried out in the non-inertial reference
frame N a in which the accelerating electron is at rest. The reason for this is that the calculation of the electric
ﬁeld and the self-force of an accelerating electron in N a is crucial for the application of the principle of
equivalence since it relates those quantities of an electron in an accelerating (non-inertial) frame N a and in
a non-inertial frame N g supported in a gravitational ﬁeld. Another advantage of calculating the electron’s
electric ﬁeld in a non-inertial frame N n is that it is obtained only from the scalar potential ϕn in N n and
the calculations do not involve retarded times (throughout the paper the superscript n = a will refer to an
accelerating reference frame and n = g will refer to a frame supported in a gravitational ﬁeld).
The four-vector potential of an electron described in a non-inertial reference frame N n is:

where ϕn and An are the scalar and vector potentials in the non-inertial frame; as usual Greek letters take
on values 0, 1, 2, and 3 while Arabic letters run from 1 to 3. For an electron at rest in N n the four-vector
potential reduces to

nAµ = (ϕn, An) ,

nAµ = (ϕn, 0) .

From here we can deﬁne the ﬁeld-strength tensor in N n:

nF µν = ∂µ nAν − ∂ν nAµ,

where dσν is a timelike 4-vector which is orthogonal to the instantaneous three-dimensional space of N n at a
given moment and nν = vν/c (where vν is the velocity four-vector) is the normal to that space with components
(1, 0, 0, 0) in the instantaneous (co-moving) inertial frame at the same moment [16], [32, p. 757] and in N n as
well (at that moment N n coincides with its instantaneously co-moving inertial frame). In N n dσν reduces to
dV n, where dV n is the anisotropic volume element in a non-inertial reference frame to be deﬁned later; in the
instantaneous inertial frame dσν reduces to the ordinary volume element dV . When the electron is at rest in
N n only the time component of dσν is diﬀerent from zero in N n and since v0 = c in N n the self-force with
which the non-inertial electron acts upon itself becomes

An electron in an accelerating reference frame N a. Consider an uniformly accelerating electron whose
acceleration is a. The standard treatment of such an electron is to calculate its potentials and electromagnetic
ﬁeld in an inertial reference frame I [32]. The potentials of the moving electron in I are the Li´enard-Wiechert
potentials [32, p. 663], [33, p. 419]

The principle of equivalence requires that the electric ﬁeld of an electron at rest in a non-inertial reference
frame N g supported in a gravitational ﬁeld should have the shape of the electric ﬁeld of an accelerating electron
determined in the frame N a in which it is at rest when a is substituted with −g. For this reason we cannot
use (3) to compare it with the electron’s electric ﬁeld in N g (when we calculate it later in the paper) since
(3) is the electric ﬁeld of an accelerating electron determined in the inertial frame I (instantaneously at rest
with respect to the electron). Although the correct application of the equivalence principle relates the electric
ﬁelds of an electron in N g and N a it is usually assumed that when the electron’s electric ﬁeld is calculated
in N a it should be as distorted as its instantaneous ﬁeld (3) in I - the expression for the electric ﬁeld in N a
should coincide with (3). There is a fundamental reason for this assumption. The electron at rest in N a is
accelerating and therefore its non-inertial state of motion is objectively (absolutely) diﬀerent from the inertial
state of motion of an electron moving with uniform velocity.
In general, the state of motion of a particle
is absolute or observer-independent (the same for an inertial and a non-inertial observer) since the geodesic
worldline of an inertial particle is absolutely (observer-independently) diﬀerent from the non-geodesic worldline
representing a non-inertial particle. Therefore, both an inertial observer I and a non-inertial observer N n agree
on whether or not a particle is inertial (represented by a geodesic worldline). In the case of an electron its
state of motion will aﬀect its electric ﬁeld in such a way that I and N n will be able to distinguish between an
inertial and a non-inertial electron by determining its electric ﬁeld. For both I and N n the electric ﬁeld of an
inertial electron should be the Coulomb ﬁeld whereas I (instantaneously at rest with respect to a non-inertial
electron) and N n should detect an equally distorted ﬁeld of a non-inertial electron.

One then might ask ”If we calculate the electron’s electric ﬁeld in N a and get the same expression (3) as in
the instantaneous inertial frame I then why can’t we use (3) to compare it with the electron’s ﬁeld calculated
in N g?” The correct answer given above - I is an inertial frame while the principle of equivalence relates
two non-inertial frames N a and N g - does not provide a detailed explanation. The reason why the electron’s
electric ﬁelds determined in N a (not I) and N g are involved in the principle of equivalence becomes clear when
the cause of the distortion of the electron’s ﬁeld is taken into account. The distorted electron ﬁeld in I is
caused by the accelerated motion of the electron despite the fact that I is considered instantaneously at rest
relative to the electron (it is the velocity of the electron, not its acceleration, that is zero in I). As the electron
is at rest in N a and N g the distortion of its ﬁeld there cannot originate from its acceleration. As we shall see
bellow the velocity of electromagnetic signals (for short light) is anisotropic in both N a and N g and it is this
anisotropy in the propagation of light that distorts the electron ﬁeld in N a and N g. This is what makes the
diﬀerence between the inertial frame I (instantaneous at rest with respect to the electron) and N a (in which
the accelerating electron is at rest) - the electron is instantaneously accelerating in I and the velocity of light
there is isotropic while in N a the electron is at rest but the velocity of light is anisotropic. As in N a in N g also

5

the electron is at rest and the velocity of light is anisotropic there. For this reason the principle of equivalence
relates the two non-inertial frames N a and N g (not I and N g).

In order to calculate the potentials and the electric ﬁeld of an electron in N a we have to derive the expression
for the velocity of light in N a. Up to now it has not been noticed that the velocity of light determined in an
accelerating reference frame N a is anisotropic due to the accelerated motion of N a. The anisotropy of light
in an accelerating frame is a direct consequence of the fact that acceleration is absolute which is conﬁrmed
(when the principle of equivalence is applied) by the general relativistic fact (which has also received little
attention [37], [38]) that the velocity of light is anisotropic in a gravitational ﬁeld. Consider the following
thought experiment involving the Einstein elevator [40]: two light signals are emitted simultaneously in N a
(the accelerating elevator) from two points A and B separated by a distance 2z, one from point B in the
positive direction of the z-axis (parallel to the acceleration of N a) and toward A, the other from point A in
the opposite direction (toward B). They will not meet in the middle point M because during the time t, the
light signals travel toward M , N a will move at a distance δ = 1
2 at2 as measured in an inertial reference frame
(N a is accelerating and this is an experiment allowing an observer in N a to establish from within N a that N a
is not an inertial reference frame). The two signals will meet at a point M ′ which is displaced from the middle
point M (in the negative direction of the z-axis) by

δ =

where t = z/c is the time it takes the two light signals to meet at M (when the elevator is moving with constant
velocity) which equals the time for which the light signals travel the distances z + δ and z − δ, respectively (as
measured in the accelerated reference frame). This shows that in N a the speed of light in the +z-direction is
smaller than in the opposite direction (and than c) and its average value is

In order to represent the average anisotropic speed of light in vectorial notation let us consider a diﬀerent
version of this thought experiment involving four light signals. The two extra signals are emitted from point
B toward a new point C (displaced from B at a distance 2z in the opposite direction of a) and from C toward
B. The signals emitted from B have the velocities ¯ca

signal bound to C). Now the average anisotropic speed of light as determined in N a can be represented in the

Here the vector r (with components x, y, z ) has its origin at the point where an electromagnetic signal is
emitted (in our case point B) and its end at the point where the signal is measured.

As seen from (4) the average anisotropic velocity of light in N a involves accelerations and distances for
which a · r/2c2 < 1. This restriction is always satisﬁed since it is weaker than the one imposed by the principle
of equivalence. When we calculate the anisotropic velocity of light in a gravitational ﬁeld we consider only
small regions (of dimension r) where the ﬁeld is uniform (g · r/2c2 ≪ 1) which makes the application of the
principle of equivalence possible.

In the case of an accelerating reference frame the anisotropic velocity of light (4) leads to two changes in
the potential of an electron at rest in N a and described there as compared to the standard Coulomb potential
of an inertial electron determined in its rest frame

where ρ is the electron’s charge density and dV is a volume element.

First, analogously to determining the distance between the charge and the observation point as r = ct in

an inertial reference frame [33, p. 416], in N a ra is expressed as ra = ¯cat. Since g · r/2c2 ≪ 1 we can write

The second change in (5) is a Li´enard-Wiechert-like contribution to the scalar potential which has not been
noticed up to now. It turns out that the volume element dV a determined in N a does not coincide with the
actual volume element dV . To explain this it should be noted that the anisotropic volume element dV a is
analogous to the Li´enard-Wiechert volume element [33, p. 418]

dV LW =

dV
1 − v·n
c

of a charge moving with velocity v with respect to an inertial observer I in the direction n = r/r (where r is
the position vector representing the distance r from the charge to the observation point). It results from an
apparently greater dimension of the moving charge (in the direction of its motion) as viewed by I (see [26, p.
21-10], [33, pp. 418-419] and [36, p. 213]). The Li´enard-Wiechert volume element dV LW and the anisotropic
volume element dV a have a common origin despite the fact that the electron whose potential we want to
calculate is at rest in N a whereas the charge in the case of the Li´enard-Wiechert potentials is moving with
respect to I. Since the explanation of that origin touches on an open issue (which will be addressed in another
paper [39]) we shall explain it here in terms of the ”information-collecting sphere” of Panofsky and Phillips
[34, p. 342] (in deriving the Li´enard-Wiechert potentials similar concepts are employed by Feynman [26, p.
21-10] and Schwartz [36, p. 213]). In the case of the Li´enard-Wiechert volume element dV LW the reason why it
appears greater (in the direction of its motion) is the following. As the volume element of a charge approaching
the observation point (where the potentials and the electric ﬁeld are determined) ”stays longer within the
information-collecting sphere” [34, p. 343] (sweeping over the charge at the velocity c of electromagnetic
signals in I) its ”contribution to the potentials will be larger than if the charge were stationary” [36, p. 215].
If the contribution from the volume element dV LW is larger it will appear that it comes from a larger volume
element (that is why dV LW > dV in the direction of its motion). In the case of the anisotropic volume element
dV a in N a the volume element of the electron stays longer within the information-collecting sphere due to the
smaller than c (in the direction parallel to a) average velocity (4) of the information-collecting sphere which
propagates at the velocity of the electromagnetic signals in N a. Therefore the contribution of dV a to the
potentials at the observation point will be larger (in the direction of a) than if the velocity of the information-
collecting sphere were equal to c. Due to its larger contribution to the potentials at the observation point, the
anisotropic volume element dV a in N a appears larger than the actual volume element dV . Consider a charge
of length l at rest in N a. The time for which the information-collecting sphere sweeps over the charge in N a is

where ∆t = l/c is the time for which the information-collecting sphere propagating at speed c sweeps over an

say that the greater contribution comes from a charge of larger length la which is swept over by an information-

The self-force Fa

self to which an electron is subjected due to its own distorted ﬁeld is directed opposite to
a and resists its acceleration. As seen from (12) this force is purely electromagnetic in origin and therefore the
resistance an electron oﬀers to being accelerated, i.e. its inertia is purely electromagnetic in origin as well.

The self-force (13) is traditionally called the inertial force. According to Newton’s third law the external
self have equal magnitudes and opposite directions:
self . Therefore F = maa which means that Newton’s second law can be derived on the basis of

force F that accelerates the electron and the self-force Fa
F = −Fa
Maxwell’s equations and Newton’s third law.

We have seen that the anisotropic velocity of light in N a causes the unbalanced repulsion of all volume
self to which an electron as a whole is

1 that is responsible for the self-force Fa

elements −ρdV a and −ρdV a

subjected and which resists its accelerated motion. If the unbalanced repulsion causes the electron’s inertia
and the self-force Fa
self in a direction opposite to a, it is quite natural to ask what the eﬀect of the unbalanced
attraction of two unlike charges −ρdV a and +ρdV a
1 will be. Due to their diﬀerent signs as seen from (10) the
sign in the self-force changes so that Fa
self = ma. This is an inevitable but nevertheless a surprising result
since it demonstrates that not only does the self-force acting on accelerating unlike charges not resist their
acceleration but further increases it [45], [46]. Therefore the unbalanced repulsion of like charges produces
a self-force opposite to a (the inertial force) while the unbalanced attraction of unlike charges results in a
self-force which have the direction of a. Stated another way, the unbalanced repulsion of like charges manifests
itself in their (inertial) mass whereas the unbalanced attraction of unlike charges makes a negative contribution
to their mass.

Let us now calculate the electric ﬁeld of an inertial electron which appears falling in N a with an apparent
acceleration a∗ = −a (where a is the acceleration of N a). It is obvious that for an inertial observer I falling
with the electron its electric ﬁeld is the Coulomb ﬁeld. In order to obtain the electric ﬁeld of the falling electron
in N a, however, one cannot use the Li´enard-Wiechert potentials (1) and (2) in N a since they are valid only
in an inertial reference frame (N a is a non-inertial frame). They must include the corrections originating from
the anisotropic speed of light (4) in N a which we discussed in the derivation of the scalar potential (8):

with the ﬁeld of an inertial electron determined in its rest frame:

E =

This result shows that both an inertial observer I (falling with the electron) and a non-inertial observer at
rest in N a observe that the instantaneous electric ﬁeld of the falling electron is the Coulomb ﬁeld (the reason
for considering the instantaneous electric ﬁeld is to separate the deformation of the electric ﬁeld due to the
Lorentz contraction from the distortion caused by the acceleration). Therefore, the assumption that the shape
of the electric ﬁeld of an inertial electron is absolute is also proved. In general: (i) a Coulomb ﬁeld is associated
with an inertial electron (represented by a geodesic worldline) by both an inertial observer I (moving with the
electron) and a non-inertial observer N a, and (ii) for both I and N a the electric ﬁeld of a non-inertial electron
(whose worldline is not geodesic) is equally distorted. As we expected the fact that the state of (inertial
or accelerated) motion of a charge is absolute implies that the shape of the electric ﬁeld of an (inertial or
accelerated) charge is also absolute (the same for an inertial and a non-inertial observer).

An electron in a non-inertial reference frame N g at rest in the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld. In
1911 Einstein [41] showed that the velocity of light is not constant in a gravitational ﬁeld. He determined that
a light signal emitted at a source point S with an initial velocity c upon its arrival at an observation point O
obtains the velocity

Substitution of (17) into (16) gives [43]

If a light signal is emitted from point O its velocity at S is

In vectorial notation the anisotropic velocity of light determined at a point situated at a distance r from the
point where the light has been emitted is

As the initial velocity of light is c the average anisotropic velocity of light between the source and the

observation points separated by a distance r can be directly calculated

The average anisotropic velocity of light in N g (19) can be also obtained from (4) by applying the principle

of equivalence and substituting a = −g.

It is obvious from (19) that it is valid for g · r/c2 < 1. As in the case of ¯ca this requirement is always
satisﬁed since in order to apply the principle of equivalence only small space regions (of dimension r) where
the gravitational ﬁeld is uniform (such that g · r/2c2 ≪ 1) are considered.

Similarly to the case of N a the anisotropic speed of light (19) in N g also leads to two changes in the scalar
potential of an electron in N g as compared to the potential (5) of an inertial electron determined in its rest
frame.

First, r, determined as r = ct (where t is the time it takes for an electromagnetic signal to travel from
the charge to the point at which the potential is determined), will have the form rg = ¯cgt in N g. Taking into
account that g · r/2c2 ≪ 1 we can write:

Second, the anisotropic volume element dV g of a charge at rest in N g is diﬀerent from the actual volume
element dV for the same reason as in the acceleration case. Instead of deriving dV g in N g we shall obtain it

A comparison of the electric ﬁeld of an electron supported in the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld (23), determined

are equally distorted as required by the principle of equivalence.

where mg = U/c2 is interpreted here as the electron passive gravitational mass. As in the case of the self-force
acting on an accelerating electron described in N a the factor 4/3 in the electromagnetic mass does not appear
in (26) for the same reason: the correct volume element (21) was used in (24).

(26)

Fg

The self-force Fg

self which acts upon an electron on account of its own distorted ﬁeld is directed parallel to
g and resists its acceleration arising from the fact that the electron at rest on the Earth’s surface is prevented
from falling, i.e. from moving by inertia (a falling electron is presented by a geodesic worldline with implies
that it is an inertial particle). This force is traditionally called the gravitational force but as we have seen
Fg
self in (26) is purely electromagnetic in origin. Therefore, the electron passive gravitational mass mg is also
purely electromagnetic in origin.

1 changes the sign in the self-force so that Fg

As seen from (24) it is the unbalanced (caused by the anisotropic velocity of light in N g) repulsion of all
1 that is responsible for the self-force Fg
volume elements −ρdV g and −ρdV g
self to which the electron as a whole
self here too the unbalanced attraction of two unlike charges −ρdV g and
is subjected. As in the case of Fa
+ρdV g
self = −mg which means that it becomes a levitation force
[47], [46]. Therefore, in the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld, the unbalanced repulsion of like charges produces a
self-force parallel to g (called the gravitational force) while the unbalanced attraction of unlike charges results
in a self-force in a direction opposite to g. In terms of mass the unbalanced repulsion of like charges manifests
itself in the charges’ passive gravitational mass whereas the unbalanced attraction of unlike charges reduces
their mass.

Let us now calculate the electric ﬁeld of an electron falling in the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld. General
relativity describes an electron falling in a gravitational ﬁeld by a geodesic worldline. It implies that it moves
by inertia (without resistance) and its Coulomb ﬁeld is not distorted for an inertial observer I falling with
the electron. In order to obtain the electric ﬁeld of an electron falling in the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld (with

11

acceleration a = g) in N g we have to use the Li´enard-Wiechert potentials which include the corrections due
to the anisotropic velocity of light in N g as we have done in the case of an electron falling in N a

Therefore the electric ﬁeld of the falling electron in the reference frame N g proves to be identical with the ﬁeld
of an inertial electron determined in its rest frame:

E =

n
r2 .

As seen from (29) while the electron is falling in the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld its electric ﬁeld at any instant
is the Coulomb ﬁeld which means that no self-force is acting on the electron, i.e. there is no resistance to its
accelerated motion. This result sheds light on the fact that in general relativity the motion of a body falling
toward a gravitating center is regarded as inertial (non-resistant) and is described by a geodesic worldline.
Now we are in a position to answer the question why an electron is falling in a gravitational ﬁeld and no force
is causing its acceleration. As (29) shows, the only way for an electron to compensate the anisotropy in the
propagation of the electromagnetic signals (responsible for the unbalanced repulsion force each volume element
of it is subjected to) and to keep its electric ﬁeld not distorted is to fall with an acceleration g. If the electron
is prevented from falling its electric ﬁeld distorts, the self-force (26) appears and tries to force the electron to
move (fall) in such a way that its ﬁeld becomes the Coulomb ﬁeld; as a result the self-force disappears. It
is also clear from here that a falling electron does not radiate since its electric ﬁeld is the Coulomb ﬁeld and
therefore does not contain the radiation r−1 terms [40].

The result (29) demonstrates the important fact that a Coulomb ﬁeld is associated with the falling electron
by both an inertial observer I (falling with the charge) and a non-inertial observer at rest in N g. This again
conﬁrms the assumption that the shape of the electric ﬁeld of an inertial electron (represented by a geodesic
worldline) is absolute due to the fact that the inertial motion is itself absolute.

3

Is all the mass electromagnetic?

As we have seen all objections against regarding the entire electron mass as electromagnetic in origin have
been answered. The calculation of the self-force to which a non-inertial electron is subjected on account of its
own distorted electric ﬁeld unambiguously indicates that the inertial and passive gravitational masses of the
classical electron are fully electromagnetic in origin. This result provides a straightforward explanation of the
equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass. The inertial and passive gravitational masses of the electron
are the same thing - the mass that corresponds to the energy stored in its electric ﬁeld. However, the inertial
and passive gravitational mass of the electron manifest themselves as such - as a measure of the electron’s
resistance to being accelerated - only if it is subjected to an acceleration (kinematic or gravitational). This
resistance originates from the unbalanced mutual repulsion of the volume elements of the electron.

If it turns out that the strong and weak interactions make no contribution to the mass then the mass of
all particles will prove to be fully electromagnetic in origin. As the issue of the strong and weak contribution
to the mass is an open one and needs a separate study, let us outline an argument demonstrating that at
least the strong interaction does not contribute to the mass. As we have seen the unbalanced attraction
forces between charges reduce their mass (that is why the Poincar´e stresses which are attraction forces made a
negative contribution to the electron mass). Therefore due to (i) the fact that the forces of strong interaction
are attraction forces and (ii) its strength (over two orders of magnitude greater than the electromagnetic
interaction) one can expect a signiﬁcant negative contribution to the mass of a particle (compared to the

12

electromagnetic contribution). If it turns out that the strong interaction does contribute to the mass, we will
face a major crisis in physics - it will not be clear what compensates the negative contribution to the mass
that originates from the strong interaction.

On the other hand, however, the strong and weak interactions should make a contribution to the mass (as
the electromagnetic interaction does) and if they do not, then we might be forced to re-examine their very
nature as separate fundamental interactions.

Another argument that the mass of a particle is fully electromagnetic in origin comes from the velocity
dependence of the mass. It is a corollary of the classical electromagnetic mass theory that the electromagnetic
1 − v2/c2 (see [26, p. 28-3]). And instead of viewing the result that
mass rises with velocity inversely as
the mass depends on velocity discovered independently by relativity as a serious indication that all the mass is
electromagnetic, unexplainably the whole issue of electromagnetic mass has been practically abandoned. If we
assume that the mass of a body consists of several kinds of masses (electromagnetic, mechanical, strong and
weak) we have to answer the question how all of them obey the same law of velocity dependence?

p

It should be noted that a fully electromagnetic mass implies that there are no elementary neutral particles
(with non-zero rest mass) in nature. A direct consequence from here is that only charged particles or particles
that consists of charged constituents possess inertial and passive gravitational mass. Stated another way, it is
only elementary charges that comprise a body; there is no such fundamental quantity as mass. It is evident
that in this case the electromagnetic mass theory predicts zero neutrino mass and appears to be in conﬂict with
the apparent mass of the Z 0 boson which is involved in the weak interactions. The resolution of this apparent
conﬂict could lead to either restricting the electromagnetic mass theory (in a sense that not the entire mass is
electromagnetic) or re-examining the facts believed to prove (i) that the Z 0 boson is a fundamentally neutral
particle (unlike the neutron), and (ii) that it does possess inertial and gravitational mass if truly neutral.

4 Spacetime Curvature or Spacetime Anisotropy?

Let us ﬁrst consider what causes the gravitational attraction of two electrons (no matter how negligible it is).
As we have seen the electron inertial and passive gravitational masses are entirely electromagnetic in origin.
As it is believed that all three masses - inertial, passive gravitational, and active gravitational - are equal it
follows that the electron active gravitational mass is fully electromagnetic in origin as well. And since it is
only the charge of the electron that represents it, it follows that the active gravitational mass of the electron
is represented by its charge. Therefore it is the electron’s charge that causes its gravity and the anisotropic
velocity of light. The question now is: ”Is the electron’s gravitational ﬁeld a manifestation of a spacetime
curvature around the electron?” or more precisely: ”Does the electron’s charge create a curvature (which in
turn causes the anisotropic velocity of light)?” We have seen that it is the anisotropy in the velocity of light
alone that fully and consistently explains the fall of an electron toward the Earth and the self-force acting
on an electron at rest on the Earth’s surface. In addition to the electric repulsion of two electrons (e1 and
e2) in open space, they also attract each other through the anisotropy in the velocity of light around each of
them: e1 falls toward e2 in order to compensate that anisotropy caused by e2 and vice versa. Therefore no
spacetime curvature hypothesis is necessary to explain the gravitational attraction of electrons. This is a clear
indication that what the electron’s charge creates is not a spacetime curvature; it is a spacetime anisotropy
which manifests itself in the anisotropic velocity of light. In such a way, the nature of the gravitational ﬁeld
becomes evident: what we have been calling an electron’s gravitational ﬁeld turns out to be a spacetime
anisotropy in the neighborhood of the electron originating from its charge.

The strongest support for the corollary of the electromagnetic mass theory that no spacetime curvature is
involved in the gravitational interaction of electrons comes from a recently obtained result that the gravitational
redshift experiment contradicts the standard curved-spacetime interpretation of general relativity [44]: the
fact that two photons emitted at points of diﬀerent gravitational potential have diﬀerent frequencies at an
observation point demonstrates that the photons have diﬀerent local velocities at the same point since their
wavelengths do not change in the non-inertial reference frame N g in which the source and observation points
are at rest (there is no Doppler eﬀect in N g). This result is in contradiction with the curved-spacetime
interpretation of general relativity which requires that the local velocity of light be always c. Therefore the
gravitational redshift clearly shows that the gravitational phenomena cannot be adequately described not only
by the Minkowski geometry but by the Riemannian geometry either if it is regarded as representing a curved
spacetime. This situation calls for another interpretation of the mathematical formalism of general relativity.

13

A key point here is what the Riemann curvature tensor represents - a real (geometrical) curvature of spacetime
or some kind of anisotropy in the (physical) properties of spacetime. In fact, the possibility of an alternative
interpretation of the Riemann tensor not in terms of spacetime curvature but in terms of spacetime anisotropy
has always existed since the creation of general relativity but received no attention.
In this interpretation
the Riemannian geometry describes not a curved but an anisotropic spacetime thus linking gravitation to
the anisotropy of spacetime [40]. The anisotropic-spacetime interpretation of general relativity sheds light
on the question why it has not been possible to construct an energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational
ﬁeld in general relativity: what we have called gravitational energy turns out to be electromagnetic energy.
The consequence that gravitation has electromagnetic origin also explains why the speed of propagation of
gravitational interaction is equal to the speed of light.

Not only is an anisotropic-spacetime interpretation of general relativity fully consistent with the electromag-
netic mass theory, but also both theories imply each other. In the case of how an electron changes spacetime
around itself we see that nothing requires that it create a spacetime curvature; what is suﬃcient for the gravita-
tional interaction of the electron is spacetime anisotropy. On its part the anisotropic-spacetime interpretation
of general relativity implies that the mass of all particles is purely electromagnetic in origin since there is no
spacetime curvature that can account for the gravitational interaction of any mechanical fraction of the mass.
If we assume that the mass of a body consists of (the ordinary) mechanical mass as well as electromagnetic,
strong and weak masses then we will get a pretty complicated picture.
It is highly unlikely that Nature
has invented four drastically diﬀerent and independent causes of gravitation - a curved spacetime for the
mechanical mass and three diﬀerent anisotropies of spacetime for the electromagnetic, strong, and weak masses,
respectively. Consider the fall of a body in the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld. The mechanical mass would fall due
to the curvature of spacetime, the fall of the electromagnetic, the strong, and the weak masses would be caused
by the electromagnetic, the strong, and the weak anisotropies of spacetime, respectively. And all should work
in such a synchronization that the fall of all bodies with equal acceleration be ensured. The straightforward
explanation that it is the spacetime curvature that is the most fundamental and it is the curvature that causes
the spacetime anisotropies fails for two reasons: (i) the most serious argument not only against the curvature as
the source of the three anisotropies of spacetime, but against the very concept of curvature comes, as mentioned
above, from the gravitational redshift experiment which demonstrates that the gravitational interaction cannot
be explained in terms of spacetime curvature [44]; (ii) if the electromagnetic, strong and weak anisotropies of
spacetime originate from the curvature of spacetime why are these anisotropies present in N a as well where
there is no spacetime curvature?

Not only does the second reason constitute a strong argument against the existence of spacetime curvature,
but also provides insight into the nature of the principle of equivalence: a non-inertial frame N g on the Earth’s
surface and an accelerating (with an acceleration a = −g) frame N a are equivalent since the spacetime in both
frames is equally anisotropic. The anisotropy in N g is caused by all charged particles the Earth is build of
whereas in N a it results from the frame’s acceleration. It is clear, however, that the fundamental questions of
how charges create the anisotropy of spacetime and why it is equal to the anisotropy caused by an acceleration
remain to be answered.

Here we shall assume that the mass of all bodies is fully electromagnetic in origin despite the fact that at
present there is no deﬁnite proof that the strong and weak interactions do not make contribution to the mass.
If it turns out that not the entire mass is electromagnetic all results obtained here will still be valid but in
part.

If the entire inertial and passive gravitational masses of a body are electromagnetic, it follows that its
active gravitational mass is also electromagnetic and is represented by its charges. This means that it is the
charges (and their ﬁelds) that change the properties of spacetime around the body in such a way that the
speed of light toward the body is greater that the speed in the opposite direction. Therefore the anisotropy
inside a non-inertial reference frame N g at rest on the Earth’s
in the speed of light around the Earth (i.e.
surface) is caused by all elementary charged particles constituting the building blocks of the Earth. Due to the
anisotropic speed of light (19) in N g the electric ﬁelds of all charged constituents comprising a body on the
Earth’s surface are distorted and a resulting self-force Fg
self = mgg pulls the body downwards. Hence, what
we have called the gravitational force turns out to be the electric self-force acting on every charged particle due
to its own distorted electric ﬁeld. As we have seen the electric ﬁeld of a charge (an electron) falling toward the
Earth’s surface (determined in N g) at any instant is the Coulomb ﬁeld. In other words, the charge is falling
because it tries to keep its electric ﬁeld symmetric (the Coulomb ﬁeld); the only way a charge can compensate
the spacetime anisotropy around the Earth in order to keep its electric ﬁeld from distorting is to fall with an

14

acceleration g. If the charge is prevented from falling, its electric ﬁeld becomes distorted due to the greater
speed of light toward the Earth than in the opposite direction and a self-force which tends to force the electron
to move downwards with an acceleration g arises. As all charges comprising a body behave in this way the
body is moving (falling) downwards with an acceleration g which explains why all bodies are falling with the
same acceleration toward the Earth.

If all the mass is electromagnetic in origin it is the anisotropy of spacetime that governs the motion of
bodies. In general, planets are orbiting the Sun, light is bending when passing near the Sun, and bodies are
falling toward the Earth due to the greater speed of light toward the Sun/Earth than in the opposite direction.
On the basis of our analysis of an electron’s behaviour in N a and in N g we can conclude that the motion of
an electron is completely determined by its ﬁeld - (i) if it is the Coulomb ﬁeld, there is no (resistant) self-force
acting on the electron, its worldline is geodesic which means that the electron is moving by inertia - both an
inertial observer I and a non-inertial observer N detect a Coulomb ﬁeld of the electron and agree that its
motion is inertial (force-free or non-resistant); (ii) if the electron’s ﬁeld is distorted (both I and N detect the
same distortion), its worldline is deformed (not geodesic) and a self-force arises and opposes the deviation of the
electron from its inertial state, i.e. opposes the deformation of its electric ﬁeld. If the geodesic worldlines are
straight lines the spacetime is isotropic with respect to the propagation of light; if the geodesic lines are curved
[48] the spacetime is anisotropic. It follows from here that special and general relativity should be distinguished
not in terms of ﬂat and curved spacetimes but rather in terms of isotropic and anisotropic spacetimes.

Now we are in a position to answer all four questions formulated in the Introduction. (i) An electron moving
with constant velocity does not resist its uniform motion since uniform motion (represented by a straight
geodesic worldline) in an isotropic spacetime ensures that the electron’s electric ﬁeld is the Coulomb ﬁeld.
(ii) An accelerating electron resists its acceleration because the accelerated motion in an isotropic spacetime
distorts the electron’s electric ﬁeld which results in an electric self-force that opposes the deformation of the
electron’s ﬁeld. (iii) An electron falling toward the Earth’s surface does not resists its (isotropic spacetime)
acceleration since, as we have seen, falling with an acceleration g is the only way for the electron to compensate
the spacetime anisotropy in the Earth’s vicinity and to prevent its electric ﬁeld from being distorted. (iv) An
electron on the Earth’s surface is subjected to an electric self-force trying to make the electron fall since the
spacetime anisotropy around the Earth distorts its electric ﬁeld which in turn gives rise to the self-force.

Conclusions

It has been shown that the classical electromagnetic mass theory provides a consistent and common explanation
of inertia and gravitation of the classical electron. Inertia is the electromagnetic resistance an electron oﬀers to
being accelerated. This resistance originates from the interaction of the electron’s charge with its own distorted
electric ﬁeld and shows that the electron’s inertial mass is electromagnetic. The anisotropy of spacetime in the
Earth’s vicinity fully accounts for an electron’s behaviour in the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld: (i) An electron is
falling toward the Earth in order to compensate this anisotropy and to keep its electric ﬁeld not distorted; (ii)
As the velocity of light around the Earth is anisotropic the electric ﬁeld of an electron on the Earth’s surface
is distorted which gives rise to an electric self-force trying to force the electron to move toward the Earth’s
center. We call this force gravitational but it is purely electric (meaning that the electron passive gravitational
mass is also electromagnetic in origin). As the electron inertial and passive gravitational masses are entirely
electromagnetic in origin it follows that its active gravitational mass is also electromagnetic represented by the
electron’s charge. Therefore it is the electron’s charge that changes the properties of spacetime around itself
by creating spacetime anisotropy (not spacetime curvature).

As we have seen there exist strong arguments that not only the mass of the electron but the mass of
all particles as well is electromagnetic in origin. Therefore, inertia and gravitation of all matter are also
consistently explained by the electromagnetic mass theory which implies that this theory provides a basis for
a general theory of motion and gravitation.

One thing concerning the electromagnetic mass theory which is often overlooked should be especially
stressed: even if the mass is viewed as only partly electromagnetic, as presently believed, it still follows
that inertia and gravitation are electromagnetic in origin but in part. This fact alone demonstrates that the
electromagnetic mass theory deserves a closer study.

[28] The issue of the electromagnetic mass of the classical electron is worth studying especially in the present
situation when such a study cannot be done in terms of quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics.
On the other hand, any results obtained for the classical electron cannot be ignored when the quantum-
mechanical and quantum-electrodynamical treatment of this issue becomes possible.

he obtained the correct deﬂection angle by using the coordinate velocity of light c′ = c(1 − 2GM/Rc2).
The proper velocity of light (16) cannot be applied to the gravitational deﬂection of light, but it is
this velocity (not the coordinate velocity) that is involved in any calculations verifying the principle of
equivalence (such as the propagation of light in an accelerating reference frame N a and in a non-inertial
frame N g supported in a gravitational ﬁeld, calculations of the potential and electromagnetic ﬁeld of a
charge in N a and N g, and calculations of the self-force acting upon a charge at rest in N a and N g,

In accordance with an old suggestion of Asher Peres (1962), we consider the elec-

tromagnetic ﬁeld as fundamental and the metric as a subsidiary ﬁeld. In following

up this thought, we formulate Maxwell’s theory in a diﬀeomorphism invariant and

metric-independent way. The electromagnetic ﬁeld is then given in terms of the ex-

citation H = (

,

) and the ﬁeld strength F = (E, B). Additionally, a local and

H

D

linear “spacetime relation” is assumed between H and F , namely H

κF , with

∼

the constitutive tensor κ. The propagation is studied of electromagnetic wave fronts

(surfaces of discontinuity) with a method of Hadamard. We ﬁnd a generalized Fres-

nel equation that is quartic in the wave covector of the wave front. We discuss under

which conditions the waves propagate along the light cone. Thereby we derive the

metric of spacetime, up to a conformal factor, by purely electromagnetic methods.

INTRODUCTION

“It is therefore suggested to consider the electromagnetic ﬁeld as fundamental, and the

metric ﬁeld only as a subsidiary quantity.” This is a quotation from an article that Asher

Peres [19] wrote in 1962. Asher’s idea was to start with the source-free Maxwell equations

dH = 0 ,

dF = 0 ;

(1)

here we have the excitation H = (

,

) and the ﬁeld strength F = (E, B). The equations (1)

H

D

are diﬀeomorphism invariant and independent of the metric gij(x) of spacetime. In other

words, this is the premetric form [3, 11, 12, 22, 30, 31] of Maxwell’s equations (without

source). The excitation H and the ﬁeld strength F are considered to be directly measurable

quantities, via Maxwellian double place in the case of

and via the Coulomb force in the

case of E; analogous procedures exist for

and B, respectively, see [4].

Peres then considered the “constitutive” law relating H and F in vacuum, namely

D

H

H = λ ⋆F ,

as a deﬁnition of the metric; λ is a universal constant and ⋆ the (metric dependent) Hodge

star operator. In components the metric is displayed more explicitly,

with ˇH ij = 1

1, 0. The components of the excitation and ﬁeld strength 2-forms are given by H =
dxj/2, respectively. The components ˇH ij and Fkℓ are

assumed to be known and (3) has to be resolved with respect to the metric gij. This was

the program of Peres [19] for deriving the metric from the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

Without doubt, Peres is the forerunner of the movement to construct the metric of space-

time out of purely electromagnetic data. The algebraic method used by Peres in his attempt

was analyzed in detail by Rubilar [23]. Subsequent to Peres [19], Toupin [30] and Sch¨onberg

[27] proved the existence of a metric in this context. Nowadays we know [4] that the pro-

gram, as layed out by Peres, can be explicitly implemented. In this paper, which we would

like to dedicate to Asher Peres on the occasion 70th birthday, we are going to sketch this

procedure.

Notation (see [4]): We use the formalism of exterior diﬀerential forms. We denote the

frame by eα, with the anholonomic or frame indices α, β,
respect to a natural frame ∂i, we have eα = ei

α ∂i, where i, j,

· · ·

= 0, 1, 2, 3. Decomposed with

= 0, 1, 2, 3 are holonomic

· · ·

or coordinate indices. The frame eα is the vector basis of the tangent space at each point of

the 4D spacetime manifold. The symbol

denotes the interior and

the exterior product.

II. PREMETRIC ELECTRODYNAMICS

Since electric charges are occurring in nature in integer multiples of e/3, here e is the

elementary charge, they can be counted. Accordingly, if we consider a 3-dimensional (3D)

volume, we can count how many elementary charges are contained in it. Macroscopically in

4 dimensions (4D), we can describe the charge density and its ﬂux by the 3-form J that is

conserved:

If the global version of charge conservation (4) is suitably formulated, by de Rham’s theorem

the electric current J turns out to be exact:

dJ = 0 .

J = dH .

3

(4)

(5)

This is the inhomogeneous Maxwell equation, with the excitation 2-form H.

In deriving (4) and (5), only the ability to deﬁne an arbitrary 4D volume is necessary

together with the counting of electric charges. No distance measurement nor any paral-

4

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

lel transfer is involved. Therefore it is evident that the inhomogeneous Maxwell equation

already exists on a 4D manifold without metric and without linear connection.

With the help of the Lorentz force density

fα = (eα⌋

F )

∧

J ,

we can deﬁne the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength 2-form F . If F is integrated over a 2D area,

it describes the magnetic ﬂux lines piercing through this area.

In certain situations, inside a superconducting region of a superconductor of type II,

magnetic ﬂux lines are quantized and can be counted. Here again, the counting of certain

units, now the magnetic ﬂux quanta, together with the ability to circumscribe a 2D area

element, is all what is needed to formulate a conservation law. This conservation law of

magnetic ﬂux we assume to be generally valid:

dF = 0 .

Again, no metric and no linear connection of spacetime is involved. As we will discuss below,

Faraday’s induction law is a consequence of (7) thereby giving (7) a ﬁrm experimental basis.

Also without using a metric, we can decompose the ﬁelds entering the Maxwell equations

into 1 plus 3 dimensions [4],

H =

− H ∧

dσ +

J =

and

Here σ is the prototype of a time variable. The Lenz factor we put to one in accordance

with the Lenz rule, fλ = +1, see [8] for details. We also decomposed the potential 1-form A

that is deﬁned by F = dA.

Using these decompositions and substituting them into the Maxwell equations (5) and

(7), we ﬁnd the conventional form of the Maxwell equations,

images of 1-forms are represented by two neighboring planes. The nearer the planes, the stronger

the 1-form is. The 2-forms are pictured as ﬂux tubes. The thinner the tubes are, the stronger the

ﬂow is. The diﬀerence between a twisted and an untwisted form accounts for the two diﬀerent types

of 1- and 2-forms, respectively. Taken from Hehl and Obukhov [4].

We can complete this premetric electrodynamics by substituting (5) into (6). Then, by

some algebra and by some physical arguments, one ends up with an axiom for the energy-

momentum current 3-form of the electromagnetic ﬁeld:

(11)

In equations (4) to (11), we collected all fundamental relations of classical electrodynam-

ics. They are all diﬀeomorphism invariant, that is, completely independent of the coordinates

used. With the exceptions of (6) and (11), the equations are also invariant under arbitrary

linear frame transformations.

In contrast, eqs.(6) and (11), like the frame eα, transform

linearly, that is, they are covariant under linear frame transformations.

We started by counting electric charges and magnetic ﬂux lines, used no metric (i.e.,

no gravitational potential) and no linear connection of spacetime, and found a generally

covariant basis for electrodynamics.

In particular, there is no relation whatsoever to the

Poincar´e group (also known as inhomogeneous Lorentz group). It simply does not enter at

6

that level of our setting up of classical electrodynamics. Classical electrodynamics is not so

closely related to special relativity as most representations in textbooks want to make us

believe.

The present framework can be suitably generalized in order to allow for magnetic charges

(tantamount of violating magnetic ﬂux conservation, i.e., dF

= 0), see [5, 9]. However,

since magnetic charges have never been found experimentally, we will not follow this train

of thought any further.

In contrast, the violation of electric charge conservation, i.e., dJ

= 0, would probably

hit our axiomatic set-up fatally. Firstly, the inhomogeneous Maxwell equation (5) would be

lost and secondly, the Lorentz force density (6), with a non-conserved charge, is no longer

expected to qualify as a bona ﬁde deﬁning equation for the electromagnetic ﬁeld strength

F . L¨ammerzahl et al. [14, 15, 16] developed an electrodynamic theory in the framework of

which one can accommodate a violation of electric charge conservation. They use it as a

test theory for interpreting corresponding experiments. They propose such experiments in

order to improve the experimental bounds for charge conservation.

Since in elementary particle physics all evidence supports electric charge conservation,

we will stick to this principle and will continue our considerations by assuming the validity

of (4) and (7), respectively.

One could ask why these two conservation laws are so “stable”. The absolute dimensions

of current and ﬁeld strength are [J] = q and [F ] = h/q, respectively, with q

dimension

∼

of charge and h
dimension of action. Let us assume that the elementary charge e and
Planck’s constant ~ are really constants of nature, that is, neither time nor space dependent.
Then the elementary quanta of charge e/3 and ﬂux π~/e are also constants, and this would

∼

assure the permanence of charge and ﬂux. The corresponding conservation laws, including

the premetric Maxwell equations (10), are thereby implied. The only problem with this

argument is that ﬂux occurs in quantized form only under special circumstances. Closely

related ideas were put forward by Peres [20, 21].

Many electromagnetic theories fulﬁll, indeed, electric charge and magnetic ﬂux conser-

vation (4) and (7), respectively. Let us quote as examples nonlinear Born-Infeld electro-

dynamics [1], the quantum ﬁeld theoretically motivated pseudo-classical Heisenberg-Euler

electrodynamics [6], and, as a more recent case, the axion type electrodynamics of Car-

roll, Field, and Jackiw [2].

Itin [7] has shown that the CFJ-electrodynamics can be put

6
6
in premetric form. We just have to assume the constitutive law H = ⋆F + aF , with the

metric-dependent Hodge star ⋆ and the scalar function a := vt/2, where v is an absolute

(i.e., prescribed) ﬁeld and t the time coordinate. A violation of the Lorentz symmetry is

obtained by postulating this explicit (and noncovariant) time dependence of the constitutive

tensor.

As we have seen, premetric electrodynamics turns out to be a useful framework for clas-

sifying diﬀerent models of electrodynamics.

III. LOCAL AND LINEAR SPACETIME RELATION

The premetric framework, which we discussed so far, is incomplete. As we can read oﬀ

from (10), we have 3 + 3 = 6 equations for determining the time evolution of the elec-

tromagnetic ﬁeld (H; F ). However, the latter is described by the 6 + 6 = 12 components

sume that the excitation H is a functional of the ﬁeld strength F . For vacuum spacetime,

such a relation is expected to be local, i.e., no integrals are involved linking H(xi) to F at

another event (no heredity eﬀects). Furthermore, linearity will be assumed (linear response).

Accordingly, a local and linear operator κ will be postulated to exist, that is, H = κ(F ). In

components H = Hαβ ϑα

ϑb/2 etc., this spacetime relation reads,

All information on the electromagnetic properties of spacetime is encoded in the 36 com-

ponents of κ or χ, respectively. It is straightforward to decompose χ irreducibly under the

linear group GL(4, R). The 6

antisymmetric, and its trace pieces:

and (21) are responsible for the electric and magnetic Faraday eﬀects, respectively, whereas

skewon terms in (22) and (23) describe optical activity.

IV. PROPAGATION OF WAVES: FRESNEL-HADAMARD APPROACH

Wave propagation is a very important physical phenomenon in classical ﬁeld theory. In

electrodynamics, one usually distinguishes between physical optics and geometric optics. We

will conﬁne our attention to the latter case. The appropriate formalism is then provided by

the Fresnel-Hadamard approach in which a wave is described in terms of the propagation of

a discontinuity of the ﬁeld. Let us deﬁne the surface of discontinuity S locally by a function

Φ such that Φ = const on S. As usual, we denote by [

] (x) the discontinuity of a function

across S, and q := dΦ is the wave covector. Then for an ordinary wave, the geometric

F
Hadamard conditions are satisﬁed across S:

F

∧

∧

[H] = 0 ,

[dH] = q

h,

[F ] = 0 ,

[dF ] = q

f.

The 2-forms h and f describe the jumps of the derivatives of the electromagnetic ﬁelds.

Using Maxwell’s equations (5) and (7), we ﬁnd

The latter equation can evidently be solved by f = q

a, with an arbitrary covector a. Now

we use the spacetime relation H = κ(F ). The corresponding relation for the jump 2-forms

h = 0,

f = 0.

A. Generalized Fresnel equation and Tamm-Rubilar tensor

Now we are in a position to derive the Fresnel equation for the wave covector q. As

a preliminary step we recall that a 3-form in 4D has four components. Consequently, we

can conveniently recast the 3-form equation (27) into an equivalent 4-form equation by

multiplication with ϑα = ei

This algebraic system for the covector a obviously admits the gauge freedom aβ →

the local anholonomic coframe as ϑˆ0 ∗= q. This can always be done without restricting the

χijkl + α ǫijkl, the total antisymmetry of the Levi-Civita ǫ evidently

ijkl(χ) qiqjqkql = 0 .

(35)

This quartic equation in the components qi of the wave covector q was derived from a

determinant of a 3

wave surface in general, which, incidentally, is not exactly what we are observing in vacuum

at the present epoch of our universe.

B. Decomposing Fresnel equation into time and space pieces

Physically, the zeroth component component of the wave covector is interpreted as the

frequency of a “photon”, whereas the spatial 3-vector part represents its momentum. Ac-

cordingly, the physical contents of the Fresnel equation becomes more transparent after

we carefully separate it into its time and its space pieces. It is convenient to denote the

V. REDUCING THE QUARTIC WAVE SURFACE TO THE LIGHT CONE

A. Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics in vacuum

(which describes also the light propagation in an anisotropic purely dielectric crystal), the

C. Suﬃcient condition for unique light cone: electric/magnetic reciprocity

The algebraic condition (50) imposes a highly nontrivial constraint on the components

of the constitutive matrices. Although a particular solution (for the homogeneous dielec-

tric/magnetic medium) can be easily derived, the general solution of (50) is unknown. There

15

exists, however, another suﬃcient condition for the reduction of the quartic Fresnel surface

to a unique light cone which admits a complete solution. Let us put skewon and axion ﬁelds

right-hand-side with (18) constructed of the symmetric matrices

j = 0, α = 0. Then the spacetime relation (17) contains only the ﬁrst term on the

Since the times of Maxwell and Heaviside, in the equations of electrodynamics a certain

symmetry was noticed between the electric and the magnetic quantities and was used in

theoretical discussions. We formulate electric/magnetic reciprocity as follows [4]: the energy-
momentum current (11) is electric/magnetic reciprocal, i.e., it remains invariant Σα →

with the twisted zero-form (pseudo-scalar function) ζ = ζ(x) of dimension [ζ] = [H]/[F ] =

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The main goal of this paper was to demonstrate that the light cone can be recovered from

a local and linear spacetime relation of classical electrodynamics. Closure and symmetry of

this spacetime relation are suﬃcient conditions that guarantee the reduction of the general

quartic Fresnel wave surface to a unique light cone. The closure relation alone, without the

assumption of symmetry, is not suﬃcient for the recovery of the light cone structure [24].

As a result of the reduction of the quartic Fresnel surface, we ﬁnd the spacetime met-

ric with Minkowski (aka Lorentz) signature. This is intimately related to the minus sign

in the reciprocity transformation (52) and the closure relation (54). A plus sign would

yield the wrong Euclidean signature. Our approach shows that one can treat the du-

ality operator # as a metricfree predecessor of the Hodge operator ⋆ that appears in

the standard Maxwell-Lorentz spacetime relation: # (duality operator) of Eq. (55)

⋆ (Hodge operator) of Eq. (2).

Summarizing, the conformal part of the metric, that is, the light cone, naturally emerges

in our framework from a local and linear spacetime relation. In this sense, the light cone

(and the spacetime metric) is an electromagnetic construct.

VII. APPENDIX: WAVE AND RAY SURFACES

The drawing in Fig. 2 doesn’t depict the wave surface but rather the so-called ray surface

which is dual to the wave surface. In the particular case of Fig. 2, the propagation in an
c εab, εab = diag(ε1, ε2, ε3), and
anisotropic dielectric medium is discussed with
Bab = c δab (with c as speed of light). Then we can immediately verify from (45)-(47) that
M =

ε1ε2ε3/c3, M abcd = c δ(abεcd), and

ab =

surface with x = s0s1/~s2, y = s0s2/~s2, z = s0s3/~s2. The vectors S0, S, and S′ represent
the particular rays related to the corresponding Poynting vectors, whereas N0, N, and N′

represent the wave fronts (propagating along the corresponding wave covectors q) dual to
them. The Poynting vector ~s = ~E
~H describes the energy ﬂux density, the wave vector
~B the momentum density.

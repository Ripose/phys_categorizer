Asymptotic conditions of motion for radiating charged particles

James L. Anderson
Department of Physics, Stevens Institute of Technology,
Hoboken, New Jersey 07030

Approximate asymptotic conditions on the motion of compact, electrically charged particles are de-
rived within the framework of general relativity using the Einstein, Infeld, Hoﬀmann (EIH) surface
integral method. While superﬁcially similar to the Abraham-Lorentz and Lorentz-Dirac equations,
these conditions diﬀer from them in several fundamental ways. They are not equations of motion in
the usual sense but rather a set of conditions which the these motions must obey asymptotically in
the future of an initial starting time. And furthermore, they do not admit the run-away solutions
of these other equations. As in the original EIH work, they are integrability conditions gotton from
integrating the empty-space (i.e., sourceless) Einstein-Maxwell equations of general relativity over
closed two-surfaces surrounding the sources of the ﬁelds appearing in these equations.. No additional
ad hoc assumptions, such as the form of a force law or the introduction of inertial reaction terms,
are required for this purpose. Nor is there a need for any inﬁnite mass renormalizations such as
are required in other derivations since all integrals are over surfaces and thus ﬁnite. In addition to
being asymptotic, the conditions of motion derived here are also approximate and apply, as do the
original EIH equations, only to slowly moving systems. A ‘slowness’ parameter ǫ is identiﬁed as the
ratio of the light travel time across the system divided by a characteristic time, e.g., a period. Use is
made of both the method of matched asymptotic expansions and the method of multiple time scales
to obtain an asymptotic expansion in ǫ and the expansion is carried to suﬃciently high order ǫ7 to
obtain the lowest order radiation reaction terms. The resulting conditions of motion are shown to
not allow run-away motions.

I. INTRODUCTION

One of the most profound and far reaching consequences of Einstein’s general theory of relativity is the restrictions
it places on the motion of the sources of the ﬁelds described by the theory. This is a unique feature of general
relativity and is found in no other ﬁeld theory. In electrodynamics, for example, one must postulate not only the form
of the Lorentz force law but also the form of the inertial forces that appear in the equations of motion. Furthermore,
these restrictions, which I have called conditions of motion, follow from the empty-space ﬁeld equations of the theory
without the need to introduce source terms into these equations. As a consequence, many of the well-known diﬃculties
and inconsistencies associated with point source models are avoided in general relativity. And ﬁnally, these conditions
of motion are suﬃciently restrictive that they limit the possible trajectories of an N-body system of compact sources
to a 6N-parameter family of curves. In the ﬁnal analysis, the origin of these conditions can be traced back to the
general covariance of the ﬁeld equations of general relativity. [1]

≪

Einstein and his co-workers Infeld and Hoﬀmann (EIH) ﬁrst derived approximate conditions of motion for systems
of slowly moving (v/c
1) compact gravitating sources up to what is now called the post-Newtonian approximation
in 1939. [2] Two subsequent papers on the subject were published by Einstein and Infeld in 1939 and 1949. [3] The
procedure used by EIH involved the evaluation of integrals of the ﬁeld equations over surfaces surrounding the sources
of the ﬁelds appearing in these equations. By using only surface integrals they were thus able to avoid the need to
perform volume integrals over regions containing the sources. Even though EIH spoke of “point source” solutions
it is clear that they were really refering to the form of the solutions in the region exterior to these sources so that
their derivation was applicable to compact sources and black holes. While the EIH surface integrals were exact their
evaluation required what has come to be called the slow motion approximation. In this approximation one assumes
that the ﬁelds and source variables depend on time scales that are long compared to the light travel time across the
system of sources. In a 1986 paper [4] (referred to hereafter as AI) I extended this idea by introducing multiple time
scales into the theory and was thereby able to avoid the introduction of the ﬁctitious dipole ﬁelds used by EIH. I also
showed how one could make use of the method of matched asymptotic expansions to include the eﬀects of radiation
reaction into the conditions of motion. These conditions followed as integrability conditions directly from the empty-
space Einstein ﬁeld equations and were applicable both to sources with and without strong internal gravity and black

holes. Unfortunately, the EIH papers are referenced only in passing even in standard texts on general relativity [5]
and hardly at all in the literature. And yet these papers contain what I would claim is one of Einstein’s greatest
contributions to physics and the only reliable method to date for deriving conditions of motion.

In this paper I have applied the EIH formalism together with the methods developed in AI to the case of electrically
charged sources up to and including the order in which radiation reaction terms ﬁrst appears. Past attempts to derive
an expression for the electrodynamic radiation reaction force within the framework of Newtonian or special relativistic
physics have been beset with a number of well-known diﬃculties. The best known of the equations, the Abraham-
Lorentz (AL) equation and its special relativistic generalization, the Lorentz-Dirac (LD) equation (collectively the
ADL equations) have been the source of continued discussion in the scientiﬁc literature. [6] - [14]. All derivations of
these equations have required one or more ad hoc assumptions concerning the form of a force law, an inertial reaction
force or an indeterminate integral. Many derivations also require some form of inﬁnite mass renormalization and
they all make an arbitrary choice of the retarded over the advanced potential in constructing the ﬁeld of a moving
charge. Thus Dirac was forced to assume the form of the indeterminant (in fact, inﬁnite) integrals that appeared in
his derivation.

But perhaps the most serious problem associated with the ADL equations is the existence of the famous (or
infamous, depending on one’s point of view) run-away solutions possessed by these equations. Their existence alone
should have been suﬃcient evidence that there was something basically wrong with the whole enterprise. Dirac
sought to eliminate these solutions by imposing the condition that in the asymptotic future all accelerations should
be ﬁnite. This condition however leads to the phenomena of “pre-acceleration” with its attendant acausality. As
a consequence, several authors have been led to propose alternative equations of motion for radiating charges. [15]
Such ad hoc modiﬁcations, motivated by little more than the desire to avoid the run-away sloution problem can
hardly be considered to be a satisfactory solution to the problem. But more, it is far from obvious nor has it been
shown that any of these equations are compatible with the restrictions imposed by general relativity on the motion
of sources of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. And indeed, if one accepts general relativity as a fundamental theory, one has
no alternative than to accept, as one of its consequences, the restrictions it imposes on the motion of sources of both
the electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds.

The ﬁrst derivation of conditions on the motion of electrically charged sources that did not involve an inﬁnite mass
renormalization and/or ad hoc assumptions of the type discussed above was that of Infeld and Wallace (IW). [16]
This derivation applied the EIH procedure to the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations and was thus able to avoid the
diﬃculties of the other derivations. Strangly, this paper is almost never refered to in the literature. However, in spite
of its superiority over other derivations, the IW derivation did not overcome all of the diﬃculties of the ALD equation.
IW gave seperate derivations using half-advanced plus half-retarded and pure retarded potentials and argued that the
former was more “natural” even though there was no radiation damping in this case! In their derivations IW focused
on one charge, which they took to be momentarily at rest, in an external ﬁeld. After obtaining their conditions of
motion for it from EIH type surface integrals they then performed a Lorentz boost to obtain conditions for arbitrary
velocities. Unfortunately, dynamical eﬀects involving accelerations can be missed in this way and indeed, such eﬀects
are not present in the IW conditions. They also assumed, as did EIH, that they had derived equations of motion
rather than asymptotic conditions and hence were unable to rule out run-away solutions. And ﬁnally, theirs was a
formal expansion in powers of a parameter λ which was in the end set equal to unity.

In what follows I will present the details of the derivation of the conditions imposed on the motion of the sources
of electromagnetic and gravitational ﬁelds by applying the EIH method to the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations
of general relativity. In the next section I will discuss brieﬂy earlied derivations of the radiation reaction force with
emphasis on the Dirac derivation which is nearest in spirit to the EIH method so that one can see the essential
diﬀerences in the two approaches. Section III will present a derivation of the EIH surface integrals and Section IV
will outline the approximation procedures needed to evaluate these integrals. Section V contains the details of the
derivation and the paper concludes with a brief summary.

II. CLASSICAL DERIVATIONS AND THEIR PROBLEMS

By classical I mean here derivations of the electromagnetic radiation reaction force that do not use the general theory
of relativity. Most of these derivations attempt to calculate in one way or another a “self”-force of a charged particle
acting on itself. The ﬁrst derivations of this kind were given in 1903 by Abraham and 1904 by Lorentz. [17] These
early derivations made use of a charge model consisting of a rigid, spherically symmetric charge distribution ρ(x) of
radius a and calculated this force by summing up the interactions of pairs of the inﬁnitesimal elements comprising the
charge. Because of the assumption of rigidity the results of these calculations were only applicable to non-relativistic
motions. The result of these calculations was a series expansion of the form

It is this term which gives most of the trouble in these derivations since it is proportional to e2/c2a. In order to
eliminate the higher order terms in the expression for Fself one would like to take the limit a
. But then of course
U diverges. There is however, in my view, an even more serious problem with these derivations. In order to evaluate
Fself one must make use of the Lorentz force law. But that use does not in and of itself justify inserting it into the
right hand side of the Newtonian equations of motion, a procedure I would call proof by naming. Nor can one be

In order to avoid the non-relativistic restrictions of the AL model, Feynman [8] suggested using a cutoﬀ procedure

in which the Fourier representation of the retarded Green function is altered by making the substitution

where Λ is the cutoﬀ factor and is ultimately allowed to become inﬁnite. Using this modiﬁed Green function, one
can calculate the self-force of a point charge on itself by evaluating the Lorentz force at the location of the charge.
[9] The result is ﬁnite and is the relativistic extension of the AL self force with the charge radius a replaced by 1/Λ..
Aside from this feature, this derivation suﬀers from the same defects of the AL derivation including the inﬁnite mass
renormalization.

A diﬀerent approach was taken by Dirac [14] that has some of the features of the EIH derivation and is reviewed
here so that the reader can compare the two derivations. Dirac considered point charges and deﬁned what he called
the electromagnetic radiation ﬁeld F µν

rad to be

where F +µν and F −µν are respectively the retarded and advanced ﬁelds of a such a charge. While these latter ﬁelds
are inﬁnite on the charges trajectory, the radiation ﬁeld is not and is given there by

F µν
rad = F +µν

F −µν

where zµ(τ ) are the coordinates of the charge expressed as a function of its proper time τ and where dots over a
quantity indicate diﬀerentiation with respect to τ. Dirac argued that his deﬁnition of the radiation ﬁeld was physically
reasonable since, at large distances from the charge and at the correspondingly large times after an acceleration takes
place, the advanced ﬁeld will be zero. He then assumed the existence of an energy-stress tensor

order that this construction leads to a well-deﬁned wall it is of course necessary that ε be less than the curvature
of the trajectory which is inversely proportional to the acceleration of the charge. Finally the ﬁeld on each of these
spheres is evaluated in terms of the coordinates of its instantaneous center. This evaluation cannot be given exactly
since F +µν depends on the retarded position of the charge which is given by an expansion in ε about its instantaneous
position. The result of these calculations is that

In order to complete the derivation it is of course necessary to evaluate the cap contributions in (2.13). But here
one encounters two serious diﬃculties: one does not know T µν
ab initio and worse, the contribution to the caps
from T µν
em is divergent. As a consequence Dirac was forced to assume the form of the contributions from these caps.
Since the ﬁnal answer in any case must be independent of ε these contributions must cancel the ε dependent terms in
the integral in (2.15) and not, as Dirac asserts, so that the integrals have a deﬁnite form in the limit ε
0. There is,
in fact, no need to take this limit nor would it make any mathematical sense to do so. These contributions must also
be consistent with the requirement, which follows from (2.13), that the line integral in (2.15) depend only on the end
points Q and Q′ and hence the integrand in this integral be a perfect diﬀerential. Neglecting the ε dependent terms
which in all cases must cancel with contributions from the caps this latter condition tells us that

where δ4(x) is the four-dimensional Dirac δ-function, the bare mass m0 would contain a negative inﬁnite component
similar to the m0 in (2.6). As the reader will see in what follows, the EIH surface integral method circumvents this
problem by in eﬀect replacing the volume integrals in the cap contributions by surface integrals which are all ﬁnite.
Finally, this equation, like its counterparts obtained from the use of one or the other radiation reaction force, possesses
run-away solutions, that is, solutions for which the accelerations increases exponentially with time.

III. EIH SURFACE INTEGRALS

The derivation of the conditions of motion makes use of the fact that the Einstein-Maxwell ﬁeld equations for
the gravitational ﬁeld gµν and the electromagnetic ﬁeld F µν contain three dimensional curls. Therefore, when these
equations are integrated over any closed 2-surface these curl terms vanish. When in particular such a surface encloses
a source of these ﬁelds the requirement that the remaining surface terms must be surface independent and vanish
leads to conditions on the motion of this source. To facilitate the construction of these surface integrals it is useful to
write the Einstein-Maxwell ﬁeld equations in the form (I use units in which G = c = 1, Latin indices run from 1 to 3
and Greek indices from 0 to 3.)

It is these last two equations that are used to obtain conditions of motion for our charged system. They come
from noting that, since these equations must hold on any two-surface, the sums of the contributions to the integrals
that are surface independent must by themselves be zero. (The surface dependent terms must in all cases vanish

that do not vanish identically. (If there are no sources, so that the ﬁelds are divergence free inside the surfaces, then
all the integrals vanish directly as a consequence of the ﬁeld equations.)

Because one employs in the derivation only surface integrals on which the ﬁelds are everywhere ﬁnite, it follows
that there are no inﬁnite integrals that must be renormalized away. If we compare (3.6) with (2.13) we see that the
divergent cap terms in the latter equation get replaced by the ﬁnite surface integrals of U µr0
LL. It is the
ﬁrst of these integrals in fact that contribute the inertial force terms to the conditions of motion, obviating the need
to postualte them. Furthermore, since the source region is contained entirely within the 2-surfaces of integration in
(3.6) and (3.7), one need only know the ﬁelds on these surfaces and not inside. All that is required is that each surface
contain only one source, that their radii are suﬃciently large that the ﬁelds on them are weak and small compared
to the distance between sources. Thus one can equally well deal with compact sources with strong internal gravity,
e.g., neutron stars and even black holes as with sources whose ﬁelds are weak everywhere. In particular, the problems
associated with the use of point sources discussed in Section II do no occur in the EIH procedure.

IV. APPROXIMATION PROCEDURES

The evaluation of the surface integrals in (3.6) and (3.7) requires a knowledge of the ﬁelds on these surfaces and
this can only be gotten by employing some kind of perturbation scheme. The use of any such scheme requires that
there be one or more small parameters associated with the system. In the present work one of these is a dimensionless
’slowness’ parameter ǫ that is of the order of the ratio of the light travel time across the system of sources to a time
scale associated with their motion, e.g. an orbital period. It is also of the order of the ratio of the size of the system
to the wavelength of the radiation emitted by it and also the ratio of the velocities of the sources to the velocity of
light. Its precise value is ﬁxed by the parameters that characterize the source system and its motion. It should be
emphasized that this parameter is not an arbitrary small parameter as EIH took it to be nor can it be taken to be
the inverse of the velocity of light as many authors have done. In addition to assuming that ǫ is small compared to
unity, I will assume that the relative strengths of the gravitational and electromagnetic interactions δ =mass/charge
is small compared to unity and also to ǫ for all charges in the system. In this work I have only kept terms of order
(δǫ2). These restrictions have the
δ2 and I have also scaled masses and charges so that mA =
eﬀect that the operation of raising and lowering indices on all tensorial quantities is accomplished with the help of
the ﬂat-space Minkowski tensor.

A. Matched Asymptotic Expansions

The perturbation methods employed here are the singular perturbation techniques used in AI to derive approximate
conditions of motion for gravitationally interacting uncharged particles. The ﬁrst of these is the method of matched
asymptotic expansions which was ﬁrst used by Laplace in 1805 (see Ref. [18] for this and other references to this
method.) In general this method seeks to develop approximate solutions to a system of equations in diﬀerent regions
of the range of the independent variables using expansions appropriate to each region The two expansions are then
’matched’ in an overlap region where both expansions are valid.
In order to obtain approximate solutions to the
Einstein-Maxwell equations it is in principle necessary to use four overlapping regions in all corresponding to two
diﬀerent matchings, one in time and one in space.

The time matching treats the region in the vicinity of an initial value surface as a boundary layer called here the
fast zone where the solution depends on the initial value data. The solution in this region is matched to an asymptotic
region in the future of the initial data surface t = const. called the slow zone. The undetermined parameters and
functions appearing in the solution in this latter region are then determined in terms of the initial value data by
matching to the fast zone. The slow zone can be thought of as the region in which all initial transients generated by
the initial data have died oﬀ.

The other matching is the one used by Burke. [20] It matches solutions in two overlapping spatial regions consisting
of an inner or induction zone and an outer or radiation zone. What is important to us is that, in the lowest order of
approximation the solution in the outer, slow zone is a pure outgoing solution, that is, a function of a null coordinate u
and the spatial coordinates r. (In higher orders of approximation this region will contain both outgoing and incoming
radiation due to backscattering.) It should be emphasized that this form of the solution is not imposed arbitrarily as
it usually is in other treatments. Rather, it is a consequence of the fact that solutions of the wave equation have the
property that so long as the energy of the ﬁeld on the initial-value surface is ﬁnite then in the asymptotic future the
ﬁeld is purely outgoing. [21]

6

As we shall see, it is the matching to this outgoing solution that is responsible for the phenomena of radiation
damping and the appearance of irreversible terms in the conditions of motion to be derived here. Thus we see that
irreversibility in the conditions of motion is a consequence of the ﬁnite energy condition imposed on the initial ﬁelds
and not, as IW contended, because of an arbitrary choice in the use of retarded or advanced potentials. One could
choose initial conditions on the ﬁelds that would lead to anti-damping for all times but this would violate the ﬁnite
energy condition mentioned above. While the ﬁnal result of the two approaches appears to be the same, the one used
here is in accord with those used in other areas of physics where irreversibility arises in the asymptotic future as a
consequence of restrictions on initial conditions. [22]

Although in principle one could construct solutions in the fast-time zone to obtain conditions of motion in this
zone, I have not explicitly done so in this work. In general, the motion of the sources in the fast-time zone will depend
in a very complicated way on the initial values not only of the source coordinates but those of the ﬁelds as well and
will almost certainly not satisfy any unique set of equations of motion. Without this matching the conditions on the
source motion obtained by the other matchings will then only be valid in the asymptotic future and are therefore not
equations of motion in the usually accepted Newtonian sense. In particular, they cannot be used to solve initial value
problems. I will defer a discussion of the implications of this state of aﬀairs until after I outline a derivation of the
conditions of motion accurate to radiation damping order.

B. Multiple Time Scales

In order to construct approximate expansions in the two spatial domains in the slow-motion domain it is necessary
to make use of the method of multiple time scales. In their original work EIH employed only a rudimentary multiple
time scale formalism. As a consequence they were forced to introduced ﬁctitious dipole terms at each order of their
expansion in λ and in the end require that the sum of all these dipoles vanish. This procedure appeared somewhat
arbitrary and may have cast some doubt on the validity of their results. In fact, when the multiple time scale formalism
is used no such dipole terms are needed.

As the name implies, the multiple time scale formalism is used when one has to deal with systems in which
phenomena occur on diﬀerent time scales, e.g., oscillation and damping. Not only is it useful in separating out these
diﬀerent types of motion but it is used extensively to avoid the appearance of secular growth and nonuniformities in
various approximation schemes. In its application one assumes that the dependent variables of a system of equations
depend on the time variable t via a sequence of times, t0, t1, . . . where usually, but not always, t0 = t and tn = ǫnt,
ǫ being a small dimensionless parameter in the problem. In this case, which is the one that applies in this work, a
derivative with respect to t is replaced by

∂t

→ Xn=0

ǫn∂tn .

(4.1)

The dependence on these times is then ﬁxed by the requirement that the terms responsible for secular growth vanish.
(See AI and Ref. [18] for simple examples of the application of this method.)

The time scales required in general relativity will depend upon the problem being considered. If we are dealing
with uncharged particles and if t is the fastest time, characterized by the light crossing time of the system, then
ǫt will characterize the Newtonian time scale, ǫ3t the post-Newtonian eﬀects such as perihelion advance, ǫ5t the
post-post-Newtonian eﬀects etc.. Gravitational radiation is characterized by ǫ6t, sometimes referred to as the 2 1
2 -
post-Newtonian time scale (see Reference 11 for details.) When one is dealing with charged sources there are at least
two diﬀerent small parameters that characterize the system, ǫ and δ = m/q, and hence the possibility of additional
1 so as to avoid having to deal with both electromagnetic

V. CONDITIONS OF MOTION

The construction of approximate solutions of the ﬁeld equations (3.1) and (3.4) and their use in evaluating the
integrals in (3.6) and (3.7) follows the pattern developed in AI. (Here I will use the vector 4-potential Aµ where
ggµν can be expanded up
Fµν = Aν,µ

nates xA(t1, t3, . . . , ǫ, δ), charges qA(t1, t3, . . . , ǫ, δ) and masses mA(t1, t3, . . . , ǫ, δ) with A labeling the sources. One
should keep in mind that gµν cannot be expanded indeﬁnitely in a simple power series since it is not analytic in ǫ,
reﬂecting the fact that one encounters ǫn ln(ǫ) terms in higher orders of the approximation. [24] However, these terms
do not appear at the level of accuracy used in this work. In a like manner I assume that the 4-potential Aµ can be
expanded as

nm(r, xA, qA, mA)

∼ Xn,m

(Recall that, because of the smallness of δ, indices are raised and lowered here using the Minkowski tensor so that,
e.g., Aµ = ηµν Aν.)

Because of the scalings chosen for our sources it follows that the expansion (5.1) starts with
(δ) terms. Since one only needs terms of this order to obtain an

(δ2) terms while the
(δ2) overall accuracy
expansion (5.2) starts with
in the conditions of motion I will drop the index m in the above expansions in what follows. Also, in this order the
dependence of the source variables xA, qA, mA on δ can be ignored so that from this point on I will ignore entirely
all δ dependencies. Then, again because of the scaling employed, the lowest order in ǫ ﬁelds are A0

In addition to the ﬁeld expansions (5.1) and (5.2), it will also necessary to make certain assumptions concerning
the dependence of the source variables qA, mA, and xA on ǫ. To the level of accuracy needed here I will assume that
the latter two variables can be expanded as an asymptotic series in powers of ǫ of the form

where the dots indicate terms that are at least an order of magnitude in ǫ smaller that the terms retained. It should
be emphasized that the powers of ǫ used in this expansion is not arbitrary but dictated by approximation itself. As
we shall see, the masses mA will be automatically expanded as we proceed in the approximation while the charges qA
are absolute constants of the motion and that there is no need to expand them at all.

To obtain equations for the ﬁelds hµν

n and Aµ from (3.1) and (3.4) I will impose the deDonder coordinate conditions

and the Lorentz gauge condition

Here too problems arise with the use of these conditions in higher orders of the approximation and they must be

modiﬁed to eliminate the appearance ln(r) terms in these higher orders. [24]

At this point a diﬃculty arises. Usually when one substitutes an expansion of the dependent variables in powers
of a small parameter into a system of equations one simply equates to zero the coeﬃcients of the various powers of
this small parameter. However, in the present case the coeﬃcients hµν
n in the expansions (5.1) and (5.2)
themselves depend on ǫ through the dependence of the source variables on ǫ. Therefore one cannot simply equate to
zero the coeﬃcients of the powers of ǫ when these expansions are substituted into the ﬁeld equations. This diﬃculty
seems to have been overlooked in all previous derivations of equations of motion in general relativity including AI as
far as I know. It can however be dealt with in the following manner: Substitute the expansions (5.1) and (5.2) into
the ﬁeld equations and set ǫ = 0. It then follows from (3.1) that in the source-free weak-ﬁeld regionh00

n and Aµ

ǫ=0 satisﬁes

However, since h00
2 depends on ǫ solely through its dependence on the source variables it follows that it must satisfy
1. Since at each stage of the approximation the unknown ﬁeld coeﬃcients in the expansions
(5.7) for all values of ǫ
(5.1) and (5.2) enter the ﬁeld equations linearly it follows that this argument holds quite generally and so allows us
to proceed to ﬁnd these coeﬃcients without regard to the dependence of the source positions on ǫ.

It cannot be emphasized too strongly that these solutions hold only in the exterior of the ﬁeld sources and are not
in any sense ‘singular’. There are in fact no singular ﬁelds in the usual sense in general relativity as there are in special
relativistic theories for example. The sources can be either compact matter sources or black holes which are modeled
by our assumption that they have no internal dynamics and are characterized solely by their mass and charge. The
ﬁelds (5.8) and (5.10) are exterior ﬁelds and by Birkhoﬀ’s theorem are unique.

It should also be explained why the coordinate rA appears in the above solutions and not it’s zeroth approximation.
Indeed, if we were to substitute the expansion (5.4) into these solutions we could then expand them about ǫ = 0,
retain in them only the lowest order terms and add the remaining higher order terms to the higher order terms in
the expansions (5.1) and (5.2). In eﬀect, by proceeding in this manner we have eﬀectively summed partial series that
would have resulted had we not done so. By keeping all of these terms in the lowest order solutions (and we will
continue this practice with all of the higher order terms) we accomplish two things: Firstly, it greatly simpliﬁes the
calculation due to the eﬀective summing of numerous partial series. But secondly, and most importantly it enables us
to center the surfaces in (3.6) and (3.7) on the true centers of the sources rather than on their approximate centers.
Although of course one can use any surfaces one likes in these equations it again greatly simpliﬁes the resulting
calculations to use the true source centers since doing otherwise results in spurious multipoles appearing in the higher
order approximations.

A. Coulombian conditions of motion

2 and A0

With the help of the ﬁelds h00

2 found above we are now able to determine the time dependence of the
charges and masses appearing in the ﬁelds given above. To do so one needs to evaluate the surface integrals that
appear in (3.6) with µ = 0 and in (3.7) respectively using these approximate solutions. For convenience one chooses
spherical surfaces centered on the sources with radii large compared to their physical or Schwarzschild radii in the
case of black holes but small compared to the distance between them. These restrictions on the size of these surfaces
are necessary to insure that the weak ﬁeld approximation employed here is valid in their neighborhoods. In carrying
out these evaluations one ﬁnds two types of terms - those that depend on the radii of the surfaces and those that
don’t. Since the integrals as a whole must be independent of these radii it follows that the overall coeﬃcients of the
various powers of the radii must vanish identically. It also follows that the radii independent terms must also vanish
since the integral as a whole must vanish. However, these terms will not vanish identically. The requirement that
they do vanish imposes conditions on the motion of the sources as EIH showed. As a consequence, one need only
pick out those terms in the integrands that are proportional to the inverse squares of the surface radii and direction
independent and set their coeﬃcients equal to zero to obtain these conditions.

Substitute then the expansion (5.1) into (3.6), divide by ǫ2 and set ǫ equal to zero. In this way one ﬁnds that

The surface integral in equation (3.7) can be evaluated using A0

2 given by (5.10) without the need to set ǫ equal
to zero since it is linear in A0 and since higher order terms in the expansion (5.2) will not contribute to the integral
because of their angular dependence. As a consequence we obtain the result that

∂t1 mA2 = 0.

(5.11)

9

∂tqA = 0.

(5.12)

The qA are thus absolute constants of the motion. Note that a similar argument does not pertain in the case of the
masses because, in higher orders of the approximation, Θ0r in (3.6) will in general be non-zero.

The next quantity needed to obtain the lowest order conditions of motion is the lowest order contribution to the
ﬁeld h0r. In order to satisfy the deDonder conditions 5.5 we see that these contributions must be of order ǫ3 since
h00
2 ,0 is of this order and diﬀerentiation with respect to a spatial coordinate does not change the order of a quantity.
It then follows from the ﬁeld equations and the deDonder conditions, using reasoning similar to that which led to the
solution (5.8), that h0r

3 satisﬁes

and therefore is given by

where a dot over a quantity denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to t1.

Equation (3.6) with µ = s can now be used in conjunction with the above ﬁelds to obtain the lowest, Coulombian
conditions of motion. For this purpose we need to know T sr to
(ǫ3). The integral over the spherical
surface surrounding the Ath source appearing in (3.6) will vanish provided the overall coeﬃcient of the terms in the
A that remain after dividing by ǫ4 and setting ǫ equal to zero vanishes. This will be the

the sources. However, unlike in the case of the ﬁelds, we cannot conclude that these equations are valid for non-zero
values of ǫ, i.e., we cannot drop the 0 subscripts in (5.15) and (5.16). It must be emphasized that the exclusion of
A from the sum in (5.16) is not arbitrary but rather is a direct consequence of evaluating the integrals in (3.6). In
fact it could not be otherwise since all integrals are over surfaces and involve only ﬁnite quantities there. It must also
be emphasized that the inertial terms in these equations are not inserted by hand by appealing to Newton’s laws of
motion but are already implicitly contained in (3.6).

B. Post-Coulombian conditions of motion

To obtain the next, post-Coulombian, conditions on the motion of the sources one needs to evaluate the integrals

It appears that something is wrong with our calculation, since, among other things we only get 2/3 of the expected
Amperian interaction in (5.21) and the sign of the second term on the right hand side of this equations appears to
be wrong. We are led to this conclusion however only if we try to interpret equation (3.6) itself as an equation of
U µr0nr dS is the 4-momentum of the source contained within the
motion so that we might be led to expect that
Θµrnr dS is the 4-force acting on it. In fact they are not. What
surface over which the integral is performed and
H
happens is that part of the ﬁrst integral contributes the missing 1/3 of the Amperian interaction even though the
electromagnetic ﬁeld does not appear explicitly in its deﬁnition. For its evaluation we need to know U mn0

These conditions, together with the conditions (5.15), are identical in form to the ﬁrst two slow motion approxima-
tions one would obtain from the special relativistic equations of motion for a charged particle of mass mA2 and charge
qA moving in the ﬁeld of a collection of other charges using a multiple time expansion. The second and third terms
on the left side of this equation as well as the second term on the right side are equivalent to terms in the special
relativistic equations that arise from replacing derivatives with respect to proper time by derivatives with respect to

the Amperian force. It should be emphasized again however that the conditions derived here diﬀer from the special
relativistic equations in a fundamental way in that they are only asymptotic conditions and are not required to be
valid at all times. They are also derived from a more fundamental theory without having to be postulated ab initio.
The reader should notice that, without the multiple time formalism, the ﬁrst two terms on the left side of equation
(5.27) would be absent and we would arrive at two totally diﬀerent equations, (5.15) and (5.27), for the accelerations

diﬀerence in the numerical coeﬃcient, this is the same contribution appearing in the line intergral in (2.15) found by
Dirac. Here it is exactly canceled by a corresponding term coming from ﬁrst term in the surface integral in (3.6).

C. Radiation reaction

The eﬀects of radiation reaction can be derived using the matched asymptotic expansion method of Burke [20] and
its extension to the surface integral method in AI coupled with the method of multiple time scales. Since Burke did
not use the surface integral method he had to make an assumption equivalent to assuming the validity of the geodesic
equations in order to compute the radiation reaction force. Further, the fact that he did not use multiple time scales
meant that his result cannot be considered to be part of a consistent approximation scheme even though he did obtain
the “standard” form of the gravitational reaction force.

To determine the electromagnetic reaction force I will proceed as in AI by constructing an outer, slow zone solution
and match it to an appropriate inner solution in the neighborhood of a given source. To this end, following Burke,
x) = Aµ(x) are again expanded in what is hopefully
I introduce outer coordinates

bination of outgoing and incoming wave with the appropriate harmonic dependence will do. In most treatments of
radiation it is assumed that only the outgoing wave is present in the wave zone and indeed such was assumed both
by Burke and by me in our respective previous works. However, as I later showed, [21] if the energy contained in
a wave ﬁeld on some initial value surface is ﬁnite, then in the asymptotic future of this surface the ﬁeld will be a
pure retarded wave. (If one is willing to violate this condition then it is possible to have incoming waves for as long
as one wishes into the future.) One could also have solved the wave equation as a ﬁnal value problem. If one now
required that the wave energy on a ﬁnal value surface be ﬁnite then the solution would be a pure advanced wave in
the asymptotic past. As a consequence, we see that the choice here of the retarded wave solution to (5.28) is not
arbitrary. At the same time it means that any results that depend on this choice such as the about to be derived
radiation reaction force will only by valid in the asymptotic future.

The right side of (5.42) contains the ﬁrst time irreversible term in our conditions of motion. Its form and sign is a
direct consequence of having solved our wave equations as an initial value problems, leading to the retarded solution
in the asymptotic future. If they had been solved as a ﬁnal value problem so that the solution would have been an
advanced wave in the asymptotic past then one would have obtained a result similar to (5.42) but with the sign of the
radiation reaction term reversed, thus maintaining the complete symmetry of the basic ﬁeld equations (3.1) and (3.4).
Put another way, the arrow of time points in both directions. Of course, if one were to replace t by
t in the past
the advanced solution would transform into a retarded solution and the sign of the reaction term would be reversed.

VI. ALD AND EIH COMPARED

We have now arrived, starting from the empty-space Einstein-Maxwell equations (3.1), (3.4) and (3.5) and making
only the assumption of spherical symmetry for the sources of the gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁelds, at a set of
constraints (5.15), (5.27) and (5.42) on the motion of these sources. They are applicable only to slowly moving sources
and then only in the asymptotic future of some initial value surface. As such, they stand in stark contrast to the ALD
equations of motion (2.18) which are held to be exact and to hold for all times. If one were to forget the problems
associated with their derivation one would surely favor them over the EIH equations even on esthetic grounds. Except
for one problem. The ALD equations admit physically unacceptable solutions - the so-called run-away motions. The
EIH conditions on the other hand do not suﬀer from this defect as we shall see.

The source of the run-away solutions to the ALD equations is of course the third derivative terms in the expression
for the radiation reaction force appearing in (2.18). Third derivatives also appear in the radiation reaction term in
(5.42). However there is an essential diﬀerence in the two cases. In (5.42) the third derivative is with respect to
t1 and not to the single time variable t appearing in (2.18). The dependence of the source coordinates on t1 (and
t3) is ﬁxed by the Coulombic and post-Coulombic conditions (5.15) and (5.27). Equation (5.42) serves to determine
the dependence of the source coordinates on damping time t4 and contains only ﬁrst derivatives with respect to this

variable. As a consequence, the motions allowed by the EIH conditions are all well behaved. That there are no
run-away motions allowed in general relativity follows from the work of Gibbon, Hawking, Horowitz and Perry [25]
who have shown that the Bondi mass of a system of charged masses and/or charged black holes is positive deﬁnite
and the fact that if the Bondi mass is initially ﬁnite, its time derivative is negative semi-deﬁnite. The Bondi mass
thus appears to play the role of a Liapunov function and its existence therefore strongly suggests that these systems
are asymptotically stable.

To better understand the fundamental diﬀerence between the ALD and EIH equations let us apply them to a simple

problem - a non-relativistic oscillator. In this case the ALD equation reduces, for an electron, to

which is the run-away mode. It has the peculiar feature that λ
0, clearly indicating that something is
wrong with our equation. Dirac sought to remedy the situation by requiring that the initial acceleration, which must
be speciﬁed along with the initial position and velocity since we are dealing with a third order equation, should be
such as to rule out the run-away solutions. [26] Aside from its ad hoc character, this requirement was shown to lead
to acausal behavior. In the present case it would amount to taking the amplitude of the run-away mode to be zero.
Consider now the solution of the same problem using the EIH conditions of motion. In this case (5.15) would have

where dots now indicate diﬀerentiation with respect to t1 and a prime is used to diﬀerentiate EIH quantities from

where the amplitudes A± are now taken to be functions of t4. When this result is substituted into (5.42) we obtain
the equation

where τ ′ is the same function of the scaled charge and mass of the electron as τ is of their unscaled counterparts.

VII. SUMMARY

The conditions of motion derived above together constitute asymptotic conditions on the motion of charged, spher-
(δ2,ǫ7). Given the current positions and velocities of
ically symmetric, compact, slowly moving sources accurate to
a collection of such sources suﬃciently far into the future of an initial startup time they will predict their motion for at
least a ﬁnite time into the future to this order of accuracy. They were derived from the source-free Einstein-Maxwell
ﬁeld equations without additional assumptions concerning force laws or the form of inertial forces. Their derivation
did not require assumptions concerning which parts of the ﬁelds act on which sources as does the derivation given
by Landau and Lifshitz, [19] for example, nor did it require the renormalization of divergent integrals such as in the
Dirac derivation. And these conditions do not admit non-physical solutions which violate the approximations used
in their derivation. In this connection, Landau and Lifshitz are, to the best of my knowledge, the only authors who
suggest that the existence of run-away solutions is evidence for the limited applicability of the radiation reaction
force. But then, like other authors, they inexplicably ascribe this state of aﬀairs to the renormalization of the inﬁnite
electromagnetic self energy of point sources when in fact no such renormalization is necessary.

O

We see thus that the outstanding problems of classical electrodynamics, the need for inﬁnite renormalizations and
In addition we
the run-away solutions, ﬁnd their resolution within the framework of the general theory of relativity.
see how irreversible eﬀects, here radiation damping, arise from reversible fundamental equations. Rather than having
to assume an outgoing wave solution in the slow zone valid for all times it is suﬃcient to assume only that the initial
conditions are physically reasonable, that is, that the initial wave energy is ﬁnite.

O

One can ask: is it possible to do better than what has been accomplished here? One can of course go to higher
(δ2) approximation, obtaining thereby higher order special relativistic corrections. One can also
order in ǫ in the
go to higher order in δ to obtain corrections describing electro-gravitational eﬀects.But can one derive equations of
motion for these sources rather than conditions of motion? And can one at least derive conditions of motion for
arbitrarily moving sources that are special relativistic invariant. The answer to all of these questions is, I believe,
most likely no. In the fast zone the motion of the sources will depend in a complicated way not only on their initial
positions and velocities but on the initial values of the ﬁelds as well. Since during this period there will not in general
be any small parameters associated with the motion one would have to solve the ﬁeld equations exactly in order to
evaluate the EIH surface integrals and that, so far, has not been done. It is only if one waits long enough for all of
the initial transients in the motion to die down that one can expect to derive relatively simple conditions of motions.
For a similar reason one cannot derive special relativistic equations or conditions of motion. All attempts to do so
in the past have been singularly unsuccessful, both literally and ﬁguratively. One of course should not feel to badly
about this state of aﬀairs since there really does not exist a self-consistent special relativistic description of interacting
charged bodies.

To conclude, I want to argue that the derivations of EIH and those here shed an entirely new light on the meaning
of equations of motion which lie at the very heart of classical physics. It is not just the fact that conditions of motion
can be derived from the empty-space ﬁeld equations of general relativity that is important but even more so is their
very nature. In contrast to equations of motion they are both approximate and asymptotic, they do not hold for all
times and they cannot be used to solve initial value problems. This of course does not mean that everything done in
the past in classical mechanics is wrong because it used these conditions of motion as equations of motion since their
application has always been compatible with the approximations made here. But it does mean, I would also argue,
that, in a very real sense, all of classical mechanics and electrodynamics can be looked on as a veriﬁcation of general
relativity since one does not have to postulate the conditions of motion which underlie these theories but can derive
them from general relativity.

I would like to thank Joshua N. Goldberg for several very helpful discussions and suggestions for improving the

presentation.

In this appendix I will outline the method of determining the ﬁeld components needed to derive the post-Coulombian

conditions of motion (5.27). The ﬁrst component needed is h00

“...the most beautiful and important
discovery of Mechanics.”

Lagrange to Maupertuis (November 1756)

Abstract

We review the development and practical uses of a generalized
Maupertuis least action principle in classical mechanics, in which the
action is varied under the constraint of ﬁxed mean energy for the trial
trajectory. The original Maupertuis (Euler-Lagrange) principle con-
strains the energy at every point along the trajectory. The generalized
Maupertuis principle is equivalent to Hamilton’s principle. Recipro-
cal principles are also derived for both the generalized Maupertuis and
the Hamilton principles. The Reciprocal Maupertuis Principle is the
classical limit of Schr¨odinger’s variational principle of wave mechan-
ics, and is also very useful to solve practical problems in both classical
and semiclassical mechanics, in complete analogy with the quantum
Rayleigh-Ritz method. Classical, semiclassical and quantum varia-
tional calculations are carried out for a number of systems, and the
results are compared. Pedagogical as well as research problems are
used as examples, which include nonconservative as well as relativistic
systems.

1 Introduction and History

Variational Principles have a long and distinguished history in Physics. Apart
from global formulations of physical principles, equivalent to local diﬀerential
equations, they also are useful to approximate problems too diﬃcult for an-
alytic solutions. In the past century quantum variational calculations have
been ubiquitous as an approximate method for the ground state of many
diﬃcult systems [1]. In recent years there has been some progress in using
classical variational principles (Action Principles) to approximate the motion
of classical systems such as classical molecules. We review recent develop-
ments in this area of Classical Mechanics, although we also overlap with
Quantum Mechanics. In particular we shall also discuss the use of the quan-
tum variational principle for excited states, and the connection to classical
action principles.

×

In Classical Mechanics, variational principles are often called Least Ac-
tion Principles, because the quantity subject to variations is traditionally
the Action. To confuse matters there are two classical Actions, correspond-
ing to two main Action Principles, which are called respectively, Hamilton’s
Action (S) and Maupertuis’ Action (W ); these diﬀer from each other (they
are related by a Legendre transformation), and the notation S, W is not
universal (we follow current usage but in fact some authors use the same
symbols reversed [2]). Both Actions, S and W , have the same dimensions
(i.e. energy
time, or angular momentum). Maupertuis’ Least Action Princi-
ple is the older of the two (1744) by about a century, and as we shall discuss,
it is inconveniently formulated in all textbooks [3]. For clear statements of
these old action principles, see the textbooks by Arnold [4], Goldstein et al
[5], and Sommerfeld [6]. We shall review these Action Principles in the next
section. Some mathematics and notation required to deal with variational
problems are summarized in Appendix I. The distinguishing feature of varia-
tional problems is their global character [7]. One is searching for the function
which gives a minimum (or stationary value) to an integral, as opposed to
local extrema, where one is searching for the value of the variable which min-
imizes ( or makes stationary) a function. Of course this dichotomy is not so
sharp in practice, as the global problem is equivalent to a diﬀerential equa-
tion (the Euler-Lagrange equation) which is of course local. The relation has
even found its way into modern parlance [8]: “Think globally, act locally!”.
In Quantum Mechanics, where (usually) the aim is for approximations to

4

the energy by choosing a wave-function, one speaks of trial wave-functions,
which are optimized according to a Variational Principle. In Classical Action
Principles, the equivalent notion is that of a virtual path or trajectory, which
should be optimized in accordance with the Action Principle. For uniformity
we shall talk of Trial Trajectories in the classical domain, to emphasize the
similarity of these ideas.

As noted above, Maupertuis’ Action Principle was formulated in precise
form ﬁrst by Euler and Lagrange some two and a half centuries ago; for
the history, see the books by Yourgrau and Mandelstam and by Terral [9].
However, even the formulation of these eminent mathematicians remained
problematic, as emphasized by Jacobi, who stated in his Lectures on Dy-
namics: “ In almost all text-books, even the best, this Principle is presented
so that it is impossible to understand” [10, 11]. To understand at least in
part the problem (see [12] for a detailed discussion), it is suﬃcient to note
that Maupertuis’ Principle assumes conservation of energy, whereas a well
formulated principle, like Hamilton’s Principle, implies energy conservation.
As we shall see, it is possible to reformulate Maupertuis’ Principle in a more
general form to remedy this problem and also make it more useful in appli-
cations [12, 13]. It should be noted that Hamilton’s Principle does not suﬀer
from any such drawbacks and is useful both conceptually (to derive equations
of motion) and as a tool for approximations. The reformulated Maupertuis
Principle has the advantage of being closely related to the classical limit
of Schr¨odinger’s Variational Principle of wave mechanics, and thereby lends
itself easily to semiclassical applications.

Even though we emphasize two Action Principles for Classical Mechanics,
it is worth noting that there are many other formulations and reformulations
of these principles. For a list of references on this point see ref.[12]. We note in
particular the elegant work of Percival in the 1970’s on variational principles
for invariant tori (see ref.[14] for a review). The emphasis on Maupertuis and
Hamilton reﬂects the two main approaches of mechanics, one based on the
Lagrangian L and the other based on the Hamiltonian H.

In the above and in section 2 we use the traditional terminology for the
variational principles, i.e. “least” action principles, but, since Jacobi’s work
it has been recognized [4, 11] that the action is in fact stationary in general
for the true trajectories. This means the ﬁrst-order variation vanishes, and
the action may be a minimum, a maximum or a saddle, depending on the
second-order variation [15]. Hence “stationary” action principles would be
more accurate terminology. Similar remarks apply to the general Maupertuis

5

and reciprocal variational principles discussed in section 2.

In sections 2-4 we restrict ourselves to conservative holonomic systems.
Various problems are solved using classical and semiclassical variational meth-
ods and some comparisons are made with the results from the quantum varia-
tional method for excited states [16]. In section 5 we discuss nonconservative
(but nondissipative) systems, and in section 6 we mention brieﬂy particular
nonholonomic systems (which have velocity constraints), in connection with
relativistic systems. The relations between classical and quantum variational
principles (VP’s) are discussed in section 7.

2 Action Principles of Classical Mechanics

2.1 Statements of Action Principles

Hamilton’s Least Action Principle (HP) states that, for a true trajectory of
a system, Hamilton’s Action S is stationary for trajectories which run from
the ﬁxed initial space-time point A
(qA, tA) to the ﬁxed ﬁnal space-time
point B

(qB, tB),

≡

≡

(δS)T = 0,

(2.1)

tA is the duration. Here the (Hamilton) action S is the time
where T = tB −
integral of the Lagrangian L(q, ˙q) from the initial point to the ﬁnal point on
the trial trajectory q(t),

S =

dtL(q(t), ˙q(t)),

tB

ZtA

≡

dq/dt the generalized velocity
where q(t) is the generalized coordinate, ˙q(t)
and t the time. In practice we choose tA = 0 and tB = T for convenience.
In general q stands for the complete set of independent generalized coor-
dinates q1, q2, ..., qf , where f is the number of degrees of freedom [17].
In
(2.1) the constraint of ﬁxed T is indicated explicitly, but the constraint of
ﬁxed end-positions qA and qB is left implicit. The latter convention for the
end-positions is also followed below in (2.2), (2.3), etc. From the Action Prin-
ciple (2.1) one can derive Lagrange’s equation(s) for the trajectory, which we
shall not do in this review; see for example [4, 5, 6].

6

The reformulated (or General) Maupertuis Least Action Principle (GMP)
states that, for a true trajectory Maupertuis’ Action W is stationary on
trajectories with ﬁxed end-positions qA and qB and ﬁxed mean energy ¯E:

Here Maupertuis’ Action W is given by

(δW ) ¯E = 0.

(2.2)

where p = ∂L/∂ ˙q is the canonical momentum, and in general pdq stands for
p1dq1 + ... + pf dqf . The second form for W is valid for normal systems,
for which L = K
V and K is quadratic in the ˙q’s, where K is the kinetic
energy and V the potential energy. The mean energy ¯E is the time average
of the Hamiltonian H(q, p) over the trial trajectory of duration T ,

from the initial position qA to the ﬁnal position qB which are common to all
trial trajectories. Note that ¯E is ﬁxed in (2.2) but T is not, the reverse of
the situation in (2.1). We use the notation ¯E rather than ¯H because in the
early sections we restrict [18] ourselves to dynamical variables where the
Hamiltonian is equal to the energy K + V ; the general case is discussed in
note [19] and later sections.

The Reciprocal Maupertuis Principle (RMP), or principle of least (sta-

tionary) mean energy, is

(δ ¯E)W = 0.

(2.3)

For stationary (i.e. steady-state or bound) motions (periodic, quasiperiodic,
chaotic) (2.3) is the classical limit [12] of the Schr¨odinger Variational Princi-
ple of Quantum Mechanics: (δ < H >)n = 0, (see also sec.7). The connection
is clear intuitively: for bound motions, in the large quantum number limit
the expectation value of the Hamiltonian becomes the classical mean energy
and the quantum number n becomes proportional to the classical action W
over the motion. This connection enables the RMP to lend itself naturally

7

to semiclassical applications (sec. 2.3). For periodic and quasiperiodic mo-
tions the Reciprocal Maupertuis Principle (2.3) is equivalent [12] to Percival’s
principle for invariant tori [14, 20] . The RMP is, however, more general and
is valid for chaotic motions, scattering orbits, arbitrary segments of trajecto-
ries, etc. Percival’s principle has been derived by Klein and co-workers from
matrix mechanics [21] in the classical limit. Hamilton’s Principle also has a
reciprocal version [12] - see next section. For a summary of reciprocity in
variational calculus, see Appendix I.

The textbook Euler-Lagrange version of Maupertuis’ Principle diﬀers
from (2.2); the constraint of ﬁxed mean energy ¯E is replaced by one of ﬁxed
energy E,

(δW )E = 0.

(2.4)

This is not erroneous, since a true trajectory does indeed conserve energy, but
it is the source of the inconveniences referred to by Jacobi [11]. Because, as
we show in the next section, the GMP is equivalent to the HP, and therefore
to the equations of motion from which energy conservation follows, it will
become clear that energy conservation is a consequence of the GMP (2.2),
rather than an assumption as in the original MP (2.4).

It is well known that conservation of energy is a consequence of symmetry
under time translation (Noether’s theorem), either via the Lagrangian and
equations of motion [22] , or from the action and Hamilton’s Principle [23].
Similarly energy conservation can be derived directly from the GMP [12].

In the early sections we assume L = K

V and that V is time-independent

(conservative). Later these restrictions are relaxed (see sections 5 and 6).

2.2 Derivation of Action Principles

Within Mechanics one can show that diﬀerent Action Principles such as (2.1),
(2.2) and (2.3) are equivalent to each other. This we sketch below (see [12]
for more details). Alternatively, one can show [4, 5, 6] from Hamilton’s Prin-
ciple (2.1) that the Lagrange equations of motion, in some coordinates are
essentially Newton’s equations in the same set of coordinates. Reference [9]
shows that (2.4) is equivalent to Newton’s equations, quoting an argument
due to Lagrange, and in [12] we derive (2.3) from similar arguments. On a
more lofty level one can derive the Action Principles from Quantum Mechan-
ics in the classical limit. Dirac and Feynman [24] have derived Hamilton’s

8

Principle from a path integral formulation of Quantum Mechanics, and sim-
ilarly the RMP (2.3) can be derived from wave mechanics (see [12]). Further
connections between quantum and classical variational principles are given
in sec. 7.

The equivalence of Hamilton’s Principle (2.1) with the General Mau-
pertuis Principle (2.2) is worth spelling out in a little more detail.
(The
equivalence of the MP with the GMP is discussed in Appendix II). The
starting point of the derivation is the Legendre transformation between the
Lagrangian of the system and the corresponding Hamiltonian,

H(q, p) =

pn ˙qn −

L(q, ˙q).

n
X

Here n = 1, 2, ..., f runs over the various degrees of freedom, and q stands
for (q1, ..., qf ) and p for (p1, ..., pf ). Upon integration over time along a trial
(qB, T ) (where we could
(qA, 0) and ending at B
trajectory starting at A
have qB = qA for a closed trajectory), and with the deﬁnitions given above
we obtain

≡

≡

¯ET = W

S,

−

where T is the duration along the trial trajectory. Thus W and S are also
related by a Legendre transformation. If we now vary the trial trajectory
and the duration T , keeping qA and qB ﬁxed, and compute the variation of
the diﬀerent terms in (2.6), we obtain

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

δS + ¯EδT = δW

T δ ¯E,

−

which is the relation between the diﬀerent variations. For conservative sys-
tems, near a true trajectory Hamilton’s Principle is equivalent to the vanish-
ing of the left hand side. In fact a vanishing left hand side is the unconstrained
form [25] of Hamilton’s Principle (the UHP - see [12] for proof):

δS + EδT = 0,

(2.8)

where we have used the fact ¯E = E on a true trajectory for conservative
systems. Eq (2.8) has the unconstrained form δ(S + λT ) = 0, with λ = E
(the energy of the true trajectory) a constant Lagrange multiplier. For ﬁxed
T (i.e. δT = 0 ), we recover the HP (δS)T = 0, and for ﬁxed S (i.e. δS = 0)
we obtain the Reciprocal Hamilton Principle (RHP)

9

(δT )S = 0.

(2.9)

The RHP (principle of least time) is discussed in detail in ref.[12].

The right hand side of (2.7) (which therefore must also vanish near a true
trajectory) gives the unconstrained form of Maupertuis’ Principle (UMP) for
conservative systems:

δW

T δ ¯E = 0.

−

(2.10)

This has the unconstrained form δ(W + λ ¯E) = 0, with λ =
T ( the duration
of the true trajectory) a constant Lagrange multiplier. For ﬁxed ¯E (2.10)
gives the GMP of equation (2.2) while for ﬁxed W it gives the reciprocal, the
RMP of equation (2.3). An alternative derivation of the UMP (2.10) is given
in ref.[12] with traditional variational procedures, employing the general ﬁrst
variation theorem of variational calculus, which includes end-point variations
[15, 29].

−

Equation (2.7) connecting the diﬀerent variations is reminiscent of equa-
tions of thermodynamics, where two conditions are derived from a single
equation. There are many other analogies with thermodynamics, e.g. two
actions in mechanics analogous to two free energies in thermodynamics, with
a Legendre transform relation in each case [26], adiabatic processes and re-
versible processes in both mechanics and thermodynamics, and reciprocal
variational principles in both mechanics and thermodynamics (see Appendix
I). Beginning with Helmholtz [9], many of these analogies have been explored
by various authors [27].

As we have stressed, we hold the end-positions qA and qB ﬁxed in all the
variational principles discussed above. It is possible to relax these constraints
by generalizing further the UHP and UMP (see notes [25], [26], and [124]),
but we shall not need these generalizations for the applications we discuss.

The derivation we have sketched shows that the four principles (2.1),
(2.2), (2.3), (2.9) are equivalent to each other. Mathematically, the Hamil-
ton Principles can be regarded as Legendre transformations of the Mauper-
tuis Principles, since the Legendre transformation relation (2.6) allows us to
change independent variables from ¯E to T . Thus in Classical Mechanics we
have a set of four variational principles that are symmetric under Legendre
and reciprocal transformations:

(δ ¯E)W = 0

After a short interlude on action principles in semiclassical mechanics we
proceed to discuss some simple examples.

2.3 Semiclassical Mechanics from Action Principles

The RMP ( 2.3) is the basis of a very simple semiclassical quantization
method. As we shall see, the solution of (2.3) yields, for the true trajec-
tory or approximations to it, ¯E as a function of the action W , ¯E(W ). For
bound motions we then assume the standard Einstein-Brillouin-Keller (EBK)
[28] quantization rule for the action over a cycle

W = (n + α)h,

(2.11)

≡

where n = 0, 1, 2, ... , α is essentially the Morse-Maslov index ( e.g. α = 1/2
for a harmonic oscillator), and h
2π¯h is Planck’s constant. (EBK (or torus)
quantization is the generalization of Bohr-Sommerfeld-Wilson quantization
from separable to arbitrary integrable systems). Thus we have expressed ¯E
as a function of the quantum number n, ¯E = ¯En. For multidimensional
systems, (2.11) is applied to each action Wi in ¯E(W1, W2, ...), so that we
get ¯En1,n2,.. as a function of the quantum numbers ni. This method has
been found to be reasonably accurate even for nonintegrable systems, where
strictly speaking the good actions Wi do not exist. The UMP (2.10) can also
be used to obtain semiclassical expressions for ¯En1,n2,... Examples are given
later in sections 4.1 - 4.3.

3 Practical Use of Variational Principles. Ped-

agogical Examples

Here we discuss how to use variational principles to solve practical problems.
We use the so-called direct method [29] of the calculus of variations (e.g.
Rayleigh-Ritz), which operates directly with the variational principle and
makes no use of the associated Euler-Lagrange diﬀerential equation. His-
torically [30], the method originates with Euler, Hamilton, Rayleigh, Ritz
and others (see [12, 29] for some early references).We assume a trial solu-
tion, which contains one or more adjustable parameters ai. We then use the
variational principle to optimize the choice of the ai. Generally speaking,

11

the more parameters ai, the better the solution. The direct method is well
known in quantum mechanics, but is also very useful in classical mechanics,
as we shall see. We give a few simple examples in this section, mainly for
bound motions; further simple examples, including for scattering problems,
are given in refs. [12, 13] and in the references therein .

The simplest example is the free motion of a particle of unit mass on
the line segment x = 0 to x = 1. With the traditional Maupertuis principle
(2.4) once we ﬁx the energy E = v2/2 there is essentially nothing left to
vary. With the GMP (2.2) or its reciprocal (2.3) we can choose a variety of
trial trajectories. For example we can take velocity v1 on the sub-segment
0 < x < 1/2 and velocity v2 on the sub-segment 1/2 < x < 1. The action
W is (v1 + v2)/2 and the mean energy ¯E is v1v2/2, where we can vary v1 to
change W while keeping the mean energy ﬁxed. We then ﬁnd that v1 = v2, a
simple example of energy conservation for this particular trial trajectory. By
iteration we can now see that energy is conserved for the whole trajectory
on the segment (0, 1), as a consequence of the General Maupertuis Principle
(2.2).

3.1 The Quartic Oscillator

An instructive example is the one-dimensional (1D) quartic oscillator, with
Hamiltonian

H =

Cx4.

Using a harmonic oscillator trial trajectory with

x(t) = A sin ωt,

p(t) = mAω cos ωt

we ﬁnd for a complete cycle with period T = 2π/ω

¯E =

W + C

ω
4π

3W 2
32π2m2ω2 ,

W = πωmA2.

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

From (3.3), with the use of the RMP (2.3) we can obtain the “best”
frequency ω0 solving (∂ ¯E/∂ω)W = 0, which can be substituted into (3.3) to
obtain ¯E

ω0 = [

3CW
4πm2 ]1/3,

¯E =

(C/m2)1/3(3W /4π)4/3

(3.4)

1
2

12

and the period T as a function of mean energy:

T ( ¯E) = 2π[m2/(2C ¯E)]1/4.

(3.5)

This variational estimate for the period is in error by 0.75% when compared
with the exact result, as noted in reference [13]. Systematic improvements
can be obtained by including terms B sin 3ωt, C sin 5ωt, etc., in the trial
trajectory x(t); see [13] for a related example.

We have used the RMP (δ ¯E)W = 0 here since (3.3) made it very conve-
nient to do so. The GMP (δW ) ¯E = 0 and the HP are also viable for this
problem, but the original MP (δW )E = 0 is not, since the constraint of ﬁxed
E leaves essentially no freedom for variation for 1D problems [31]. One can
get around this by relaxing the constraint via a Lagrange multiplier, but this
is then equivalent to the GMP (see App. II) or the UMP. In 2D etc., the con-
straint of ﬁxed E does allow some freedom for variation, but the constraint
is very cumbersome and the GMP is always much more convenient.

The use of the action principle (2.3) to obtain the mean energy as a
function of the action (3.4) or the period as a function of mean energy (3.5),
with harmonic oscillator trial trajectories, is very similar to the use of the
variational principle in quantum mechanics to estimate the energies of states
of the quartic oscillator with harmonic oscillator trial wave-functions. We
In both
show this explicitly for the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (3.1).
cases an optimum frequency for the trial harmonic case is sought and the
ﬁnal errors are also similar. We start by computing the quantum expectation
value of (3.1) using a harmonic oscillator state with trial frequency ω,

and ﬁnd the optimum frequency ω0 by demanding the vanishing of the deriva-

Taking the asymptotic limit of (3.7) for n
we obtain the second equation (3.4). This is not as trivial as it seems, since
(3.7) was obtained from the quantum variational principle (for an arbitrary
state [16]), while (3.4) was obtained from a classical action principle.

This example illustrates neatly that the two variational principles are
related: the Reciprocal Maupertuis Principle is the classical limit of the
Schr¨odinger Variational Principle (see sec.7 for further discussion). The ex-
ample illustrates also that the classical action principle can be used as a
method of approximation, and semiclassically to estimate En as described in
sec.2.3. According to (2.11), we quantize ¯E(W ) in (3.4) semiclassically by
the replacement W
2)h; as just discussed, this leads to agreement
asymptotically ( n
) with the quantum result (3.7). Reference [16]
discusses the similar relation between quantum and classical variations for
a diﬀerent one-dimensional system, with a linear potential. The application
of classical action principles to other simple systems is discussed in reference
[13]. The application of quantum variations for excited states has a long
history: the earliest reference is McWeeny and Coulson, who applied it to
the quartic oscillator described above [32] more than ﬁfty years ago (for later
references see [16]).

For a pendulum with two degrees of freedom (θ, φ), there is an additional
term in the kinetic energy compared to that of a plane pendulum, i.e.

where θ is the polar angle (measured from the downward vertical axis) and
φ is the azimuthal angle, m is the bob mass, L the length, and g the gravi-
tational acceleration.

Using the axial symmetry around the z (vertical) axis, we introduce the
cylindrical coordinate ρ = (x2 + y2)1/2 = L sin θ, and the angular momentum
component lz = mρ2 ˙φ, which is a constant of the motion. We also expand
cos θ, keeping up to quartic terms, which are O(L−2). This gives

The motion is now in general quasiperiodic. The precession is one of the
major sources of error to be eliminated in the design of Foucault pendula [33].
(The Foucault pendulum is discussed in Sec. 5.2.2.) Because the precession
rate is O(L−2), this precession is particularly relevant for recently developed
short Foucault pendula, which are less than 1 m in length. Equations (3.10)
and (3.11) have been derived by perturbation theory [34].

To derive (3.10) and (3.11) variationally [13], we ﬁrst choose a trial tra-
jectory; we take an ellipse which is closed in the coordinate system x′, y′
which rotates with respect to the ﬁxed x, y system with the (unknown) pre-
cession frequency Ω. In the x′, y′ system we therefore have x′ = a cos ωt and
y′ = b sin ωt, where ω may diﬀer from ω0. Because the x′, y′ and x, y systems
diﬀer by a rotation, we have ρ2 = x2 + y2 = x′2
, and therefore our trial
trajectory in the ﬁxed coordinate system is

ρ2 = a2 cos2 ωt + b2 sin2 ωt .

Figure 1: The precessing orbit. We choose positions 1 and 2 as the ﬁxed end
positions to be used in the action principle. (ﬁgure adapted from ref.[4])

As initial and ﬁnal positions 1 and 2 (see Fig.1), we take two successive
aphelia at x′ = a, i.e. (ρ1, φ1) = (a, 0) and (ρ2, φ2) = (a, φ2), where φ2 =
(ω + Ω)T = 2π(1 + Ω/ω).The positions 1 and 2 and hence a and Ω/ω are
thus ﬁxed, which leaves b and ω available as variational parameters. Note
that (3.15) then implies that lz is varied with the trial trajectory (although
it is a constant of the motion on the individual trial trajectories). We ﬁnd it
easiest to use the unconstrained version of the Maupertuis principles [i.e. the
UMP (2.10)], δ ¯E = T −1δW , where T = 2π/ω is the time to reach position 2

4 More Complicated Examples. Research Prob-

lems

More complicated examples are easy to ﬁnd, and are especially interesting
in multidimensional systems which exhibit chaotic motion. Such systems
are nonintegrable, and have fewer constants of the motion than the number

17

of degrees of freedom. We illustrate the use of classical and semiclassical
variational principles together with the application of quantum variational
principles to excited states.

4.1 The x2y2 oscillator

The 2D x2y2 oscillator is a simple example of this class, which has been
[35, 36]). There is only
studied in the literature for some time (see, e.g.
one constant of the motion, the energy. Classically, most trajectories in this
system are chaotic [37]. Fig.2 shows the contours of the x2y2 potential, and
Fig.3 shows a typical (chaotic) classical trajectory.

Figure 2: Contours of the potential V (x, y) = x2y2/2. The darkened contour
corresponds to V (x, y) = 1. (from ref.[35])

Refs.[12, 13] give classical and semiclassical discussions of the motion us-
ing the RMP. Here we discuss the quantum states using variational methods
for the excited states, as done above for a simpler example. Comparison with
the semiclassical results is given later. The Hamiltonian is

H = Kx + Ky + V (x, y) =

Figure 3: A typical trajectory of the Hamiltonian (4.1). The motion starts
near the origin, then proceeds into the right-hand arm of the potential along
the positive x-axis. The trajectory eventually reverses its x-direction and re-
turns to the vicinity of the origin before entering another arm of the potential.
(from ref.[35])

We choose units where m = 1 and C = 1 , where Cx2y2/2 is the potential.
Below we also choose ¯h = 1. We take as an approximation a separable trial
wave-function ψnx,ny (x, y)

ψnx,ny(x, y) = ψnx(ωx; x)ψny (ωy; y),

(4.2)

where the wave-function ψnx(ωx; x) is an eigenstate of a harmonic oscillator
with frequency ωx:

ψnx(ωx; x) = (nx +

(4.3)

The frequencies ωx and ωy are variational parameters, which will diﬀer
from state to state, and as a result the set (4.2) is nonorthogonal. The com-
putation of matrix elements and expectation values with the wave functions
(4.3) is rather easy,

Eqs. (4.7) and (4.3) show that at the variational minimum the ratio of the
two frequencies is rational and the mean energy of the x-oscillator is the
same as the mean energy of the y-oscillator. It follows immediately that the
mean kinetic energies of the two oscillators are also equal to each other at
the variational minimum: < Kx >=< Ky >. From (4.6) we also ﬁnd

ωxωy = [(nx +

which gives the separate frequencies

and the variational estimate for the energy:

The estimate (4.10) can also be obtained semiclassically by using the
RMP to ﬁnd ¯E(Wx, Wy), and then quantizing the actions Wi with the EBK
relation (2.11); see ref.[13] for a detailed discussion. It is to be noted that
this method yields the quite reasonable ﬁrst approximation (4.10) for Enx,ny
despite the fact that strictly speaking the good actions Wx and Wy do not
exist for the x2y2 oscillator. In essence, one is approximating a chaotic tra-
jectory by a quasiperiodic one, and the RMP picks out the best such trial
trajectory [38].

The estimate (4.10) diﬀers only in the leading coeﬃcient , 3/2 vs. 1.405,
from a semiclassical adiabatic formula (SCA) obtained by Martens et al [35].
The diﬀerence between the two estimates is about 6.5%. As noted by Martens
et al [35] formula (4.10) gives rise to degeneracies. For example (nx, ny)
= (7,0), (0,7), (2,1), (1,2) give the same energies - a four-fold degeneracy.
However, numerical estimates of the ﬁrst 50 energy levels, obtained in [35],
do not show such high degeneracies. Also, because the symmetry group of
the Hamiltonian C4v (a fourfold axis of rotation, and four reﬂection planes)
has only one- and two-dimensional irreducible representations [39], we expect
at most two-fold degeneracy. We shall see that the basis (4.2) permits an
evaluation of the splitting of these spurious degeneracies. The pattern of
degeneracies is easy to understand if the bracket is rewritten

[(2nx + 1)(2ny + 1)/4] = N/4,

·

·

·

·

·

5, 5

15, 3

where the number N (the“principal” quantum number), is an odd integer.
The degeneracy pattern is determined by the decomposition of N into prime
factors. For example (nx, ny)=(2,1) corresponds to N =15 which can be
3 and these products correspond to (7,0)
factored as 15
etc. If N is a prime number there are only two states, corresponding to N
1
N, while every nontrivial factorization of a nonprime N allows further
and 1
states. The integer N belongs to one of two possible classes: N = 4k + 1
or N = 4k
1 (e.g. N =15) one of nx, ny is even and
the other is odd. This class of states EO and OE (of [35]) corresponds to
the two dimensional irreducible representation of C4v. For N = 4k + 1 (
e.g. N=21) the two quantum numbers (nx, ny) are both even or both odd
(e.g. (nx, ny) = (10,0) or (0,10) or (1,3) or (3,1) for N=21, which is therefore
four-fold degenerate). This degeneracy is split into states of symmetry EEE,
EEO, OOE and OOO, in the notation of Martens et al [35] for the one
dimensional irreducible representations. In this notation the ﬁrst two letters
give respectively the parity ( Even or Odd) of nx and ny (or equivalently the

behaviour of the wave-function under the reﬂections (x
while the third letter stands for the behavior under the interchange of x with
y. We discuss later the splitting of degeneracies resulting from the expression
(4.10). At this point we wish only to note that the degeneracy grows very
slowly with N, like lnlnN, and even for N quite large where quasiclassical
behaviour is expected (say N
105 ) the typical number of degenerate states
is quite modest, 4 - 6.

The main points of discussion arising from the result (4.10) are the split-
ting of the degenerate levels, perturbative corrections to the variational en-
ergies , and the density of states implied by this formula. For the ﬁrst ﬁfty
low lying states one has the accurate numerical estimates of Martens et al
[35] with which to compare.

4.1.1 Perturbative Shift of Variational Results

Here, the perturbation V is the last term above, and its eﬀect is already
included in ﬁrst order, in the variational estimate (4.10). Therefore the ﬁrst
correction comes in second order in V . We must also remember that that
the frequencies (ωx, ωy) are appropriate to a ﬁxed pair of quantum numbers
(nx, ny) , and change if we go to a diﬀerent pair. The simplest way to do
perturbation theory in these circumstances is to estimate corrections to each
state (nx, ny) by considering a set of orthogonal intermediate states (n
y)
all with the same frequency (ωx, ωy) appropriate to the state (nx, ny) which
we consider. Therefore we take the second order correction

Therefore, in second-order perturbation theory, the coeﬃcient 3/2 is di-
minished by about 4% to 1.437, closer to the adiabatic result 1.405 of Martens
et al [35] . The remaining diﬀerence is about 2.5%. The degeneracies of (4.14)
are still the same as those of (4.10). If we apply perturbation theory to the
ground state (0, 0) we ﬁnd

The sequence (4.15) indicates that the perturbation expansion does not con-
verge, and it is a good idea to stop at second order. The accurate numerical
result for E00 (from [35]) is 0.5541, which shows that stopping at second order
gives an error of about 3% for the ground state.

4.1.2 Splitting of Degenerate States

The basis (4.2) is also quite convenient to obtain the splitting of degenerate
states. We shall deal with the simplest example with a degeneracy: the pair of
states (2, 0) and (0, 2). Both these states have the same energy (3/2)(5/4)2/3
in the variational approximation. The wave-functions of the two states are
nonorthogonal, because the frequencies in the x and y oscillators diﬀer. We
deﬁne the overlap integral ∆

where the two wave functions have diﬀerent frequencies ( ω2 = (1/10)1/3 and
ω0 = (25/2)1/3) as denoted. The splitting of two (or more) nonorthogonal
degenerate states is well known; a simple example is the Heitler-London
treatment of the hydrogen molecule. One has to take the sum or the diﬀerence
of the two nonorthogonal states , e.g. Ψ+ = N+[ψ02 + ψ20], and similarly for
Ψ−. The eigenvalues have the form

The right hand side of (4.19) vanishes because of the frequency condition

two variational states. The same is true for matrix elements of y2, and x2y2.
Therefore only the kinetic energy terms contribute to the oﬀ-diagonal matrix
elements of the Hamiltonian . Using equations (4.18) we ﬁnd

Hence the two degenerate states at E02 = 1.7406 split into an EEE state at
1.823 and an EEO state at 1.625. We identify Ψ+ as an EEE state because
Ψ+ has EEE symmetry, and similarly Ψ− has EEO symmetry. When one
compares with the numerical results of Martens et al [35], the estimates
(4.22) are qualitatively correct; the error of E+ is about +3.7% while the
error of E− is +6.4%. One can further apply the factor of 23/24, obtained
in the previous section, to end with the estimates 1.7471 and 1.556. The
result E = 1.7471 for the (2,0) EEE state is given in Table I as Esplit. Other
low-lying EEE state energies are also given.

We end this brief excursion into the x2y2 model with the conclusion
that the quantum variational method for excited states [16] is particularly

25

well adapted for energy estimates in this system. We have used variation-
perturbation theory here to demonstrate this method. The same results can
also be obtained purely variationally, by using more elaborate trial states
than (4.2); e.g., for an EEE state we would try (for nx, ny even)

nx,ny(x, y) = N+[ψnx(ωx; x)ψny (ωy; y) + ψny (ωy; x)ψnx(ωx; y)],

and similarly we would try ψ(−)
nx,ny(x, y) for the EEO states. We return to
purely semiclassical variational methods in Sec. 4.3. For completeness, we
note that classical variation-perturbation methods have also been devised
[40].

4.2 The “Linear Baryon”

Another system very amenable to classical and quantum variational estimates
is a system of three equal mass particles constrained to move along a straight
line [41]. There are constant attractive forces between the particles, or a
linear potential ( as for 1D gravity ), and the particles can move through
each other. In suitable units the Hamiltonian can be expressed as

The equipotentials of this Hamiltonian form regular hexagons.The six
sides correspond to the six diﬀerent permutations of the three particles in the

26

baryon; for example, one side corresponds to x1 < x2 < x3, etc.The Hamil-
tonian (4.25) describes the motion of a particle inside this regular hexagon.
This system has been studied in the literature [42] under the restriction to
a single “wedge” (say 0 < θ < π/3) under the name of “ wedge billiards
in a gravitational ﬁeld”. Recently also the relativistic generalization of the
Hamiltonian (4.23) has been discussed [43].

The classical motion with the Hamiltonian (4.25) can be solved piecewise
exactly. The trajectory consists of segments of parabolas in each wedge of
the hexagon. One can visualize the system as a hexagonal “pit” or “funnel”
in a gravitational ﬁeld , with a point particle sliding inside the funnel. Since
the system is not harmonic there are no normal modes, but an inﬁnity of
trajectories at each energy. Many of these can be simply described in terms
of two prototypes having high or low “angular momentum” respectively. We
use quotation marks since angular momentum is not conserved in a hexagonal
potential. However the average angular momentum of speciﬁc orbits is still
meaningful. The low “angular momentum” trajectory consists in a motion
along a groove of the hexagonal funnel corresponding to θ = 0, to the origin
and continuing along θ = π, and back. The high “angular momentum”
trajectory is composed of segments of parabolas joined together to look like
a circle. Each of these trajectories can sustain transverse oscillations to give
rise to quasiperiodic motions. Examples are shown in references [41, 43].
Eventually for large transverse oscillations the two types of trajectories blurr
and and chaotic motion ensues.

With only one constant of the motion (the energy) and two degrees of free-
dom, the system is nonintegrable, and possesses chaotic trajectories. These
and the nonchaotic ones are piecewise parabolic, but it may be advantageous
to represent them by simpler trial functions. For illustration we describe a
low angular momentum trajectory θ = pθ = 0 when (4.25) becomes

H =

Consider the trajectory with E = 1. The problem can be solved exactly to
give a period (for the whole cycle) of Texact = 4.6188, while a variational
estimate with the RMP using a harmonic oscillator trial trajectory (with the
same mean energy ¯E = 1 as the exact trajectory) gives Tvariational = 4.6526,
an overestimate of 0.73%.

Quantum variational methods are quite useful here too since we can-
not solve the quantum problem exactly, either for the ground state or ex-

cited states. To describe the symmetry species of the symmetry group C6v
of the quantum Hamiltonian we can use eigenfunctions of the 2D isotropic
harmonic oscillator [44]. In polar coordinates these are products of an ex-
ωR2/2) times a function of θ ( sin(mθ) or cos(mθ)) times
ponential exp(
(ωR2)m/2 times a Laguerre polynomial in ωR2 times a normalization factor.
Although the azimutal quantum number m is not conserved with the Hamil-
tonian (4.25) it is conserved modulo 6 due to the hexagonal symmetry of the
problem. We can as a ﬁrst approximation minimize the diagonal elements
of the Hamiltonian (4.26) in this basis with respect to the frequency and
obtain ﬁrst order estimates for the energies of states which are labelled by a

28

principal quantum number n and m(modulo 6). For example the energy of
the ground state (n,m)=(0,0) is overestimated by about 0.39% in this basis
while energy of the state (n,m)=(15,0) is overestimated by about 3%. “Ex-
act” energies can be obtained by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in a large
basis of harmonic oscillator states and minimizing eigenvalues with respect
to ω. Another variational procedure uses products of Airy functions along
the groove and perpendicular to it, and takes the scale factors of the two
Airy functions as variational parameters. For the excited state (15,0) the er-
ror is 0.014% (the “exact” energy is 16.34869 while the Airy approximation
gives 16.3511). More examples can be found in Table 1 of reference [41] . The
probability densities of a few states are shown in Fig. 4 where one can see one
low angular momentum state (12,0) and one high angular momentum state
(2,18) and two states which presumably correspond to chaotic trajectories.

4.3 He Atom Inside C70 Cage

Endohedral fullerene complexes such as He @ C70 have attracted much study
in recent years, both experimental and theoretical (for reviews see [45, 46,
47, 48, 49]). Here X @ Cn denotes species X (atom, ion or molecule) encap-
sulated in a Cn cage [50]. Early theoretical work focussed on the prediction
of infrared and Raman [53, 54] and neutron scattering [49] spectra due to
the motion of X = He, Li+, Na+, K+ and CO inside the near-spherical C60
cage. The predictions of [53] were subsequently conﬁrmed experimentally
[55, 56] for the infrared bands of Li+@C60. Conﬁrmation of the predicted
Raman bands [53] of Li+@C60 is tentative [56]. Later the theoretical studies
were extended to study the dynamics and spectra of atoms, molecules and
ions trapped in nonspherical cages, e.g. He @ C70 [57, 58, 59], Ne @ C70 [60],
He @ C250 (nanotube) [61], Na+ @ C120 (nanotube) [62], and even (C60)n @
C∞(nanotube), so-called nanopeapods [63]. Figs 5 and 6 show C60, C70 and
carbon nanotube cages.

The C60 cage, assumed to be rigid, presents a very nearly spherical poten-
tial [64] for an entrapped atom or ion X and the dynamics has been studied
by various classical [66], semiclassical [48] and quantum [48] methods. The
potential can be calculated by a variety of semiemperical and ab initio meth-
ods [47, 48, 66, 67]. The dynamics is usually quite regular [64] for X@C60.
We discuss here instead the case He @ C70, where the potential is highly non-
spherical and gives rise to nonintegrable (chaotic) dynamics of the He atom

(from ref. [46])

[57, 58, 59]. We estimate the energy levels semiclassically [58, 59] using the
UMP as described earlier, and compare with the “exact” results obtained by
brute-force diagonalization of the Hamiltonian [57]. Classical simulations of
the motion have also been carried out [57, 58, 59], and provide insight as to
the degree of chaos in the motion of the He atom. The chaos is surprisingly
small, given that the potential is strongly anharmonic. The small degree of
chaos implies an approximate third constant of the motion [68], in addition to
the energy and z-component of angular momentum (assuming the potential
is axial).

The potential for He in a rigid C70 cage has been estimated semiem-
perically [57], and, to a good approximation, is axially symmetric around
long z-axis in Fig 5b . With origin at the centre of the cage and x, y axes
perpendicular to the symmetry z-axis, the potential has been ﬁt to the form

V (x, y, z) =

k1(x2 + y2) +

k3z2 + C(x2 + y2)z2.

z = (k3/m)1/2 =
21.934 cm−1, where m is the He atom mass. We use the standard spec-
troscopic unit (cm−1) for frequency and energy (see [58]). The last term
C(x2 + y2)z2 in (4.27) is a quartic perturbation, with C = 1.738 cm−1 when
x, y, z are in units of (¯h/mω(0)
x )1/2. There are also smaller terms in (4.27)
varying as (x2 + y2)2, z4, etc, which we shall ignore.

Because of the axial symmetry we change to cylindrical polar coordinates

which is a constant of the motion. The cage has been assumed to be rigid
and ﬁxed in space. To apply the UMP (2.10), we proceed exactly as for
the simpler spherical pendulum example of sec.3.2. When viewed down the
z axis, the trajectory is roughly a precessing ellipse, and the z-motion is
oscillatory. We therefore take as a trial trajectory

The terms of second-order in C in (4.30) and (4.31) are also derived in

that Ω is small but nonzero in general, and to obtain Ω
requires an improved trial trajectory over (4.29), e.g. one involving higher
harmonics of ωx and ωy [59]. We shall ignore this small eﬀect here.

To estimate the energy levels semiclassically from (4.31) is very simple:

where the O(C 2) and O(C 3) terms are written down in ref. [58]. We compare
the semiclassical energy levels (4.32) (including the O(C 2) and O(C 3) terms)
with the fully quantum results; the lowest 613 levels, up to the energy of
1000 cm−1 are obtained by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in a harmonic
oscillator basis in [58]. The harmonic oscillator chosen has a potential given
by the harmonic part of (4.28). The semiclassical and fully quantum results
agree to better than 1%. We illustrate the good agreement in Fig 7, which
shows the levels up to 500 cm−1, organized according to m, the quantum
number corresponding to lz.

For an isotropic 2D harmonic oscillator, the energy depends only on Nxy =
nx + ny. For Nxy = 2, for example, we can have (nx, ny) = (2, 0), (1, 1), (0, 2),
2, 0, +2.

this is found in the fully quantum calculation, but not in the semiclassical
one where the energy depends only on Nxy = nx + ny. Table 2 illustrates
more clearly the slight

5 Nonconservative Systems

−

= K

In this section we consider nonconservative mechanical systems. For example
consider a system of particles moving in the time-dependent external ﬁeld,
or a system whose parameters depend explicitly on time. Other examples
include time-dependent constraints, e.g. a bead on a rotating hoop whose an-
gular velocity is a prescribed function of time, and variable mass systems (for
V in general [69]). Such systems are not closed and the energy
which L
is not conserved. The evolution of a nonconservative system is completely
determined by a time-dependent Lagrangian L(q, ˙q, t) or by a time-dependent
Hamiltonian H(q, p, t). (We exclude dissipative systems from our discussion.
We do note that Lagrangians and Hamiltonians have been found for such
systems in some cases [70], so that the action principles discussed here would
apply in these cases. Alternatively [5], dissipative terms can be added to the
Lagrange equations of motion or to the Hamilton principle.) H and L are
related to each other by the Legendre transformation (see eq. (2.5))

H(q, p, t) =

pn ˙qn −

L(q, ˙q, t).

(5.1)

Locally these lead to the usual Euler-Lagrange or Hamilton equations of
motion that govern the dynamics of the system.

known that the Hamilton Principle

It is well

(δS)T = 0

(5.2)

is applicable for nonconservative systems as well as for conservative ones.
Here subscript T reminds us that variations near the actual path are con-
strained by ﬁxing the travel time T from the initial point A
(qA, 0) to the
(qB, T ). Again we have chosen tA = 0 and tB = T , and, as
ﬁnal point B
before, it is understood here and below that the end-positions qA and qB are
also ﬁxed.

As before, we can relax the constraint of ﬁxed T and rewrite (5.2)[12, 71]

as an unconstrained Hamilton Principle (UHP)

δS + E(T )δT = 0,

(5.3)

where the Lagrange multiplier E(T ) is the true value of the energy at the
time of arrival at the ﬁnal point B. (Elsewhere in this paper E(T ) is denoted
variously as E(tB), EB or HB; see notes [25] and [73]). We assume that all
trial trajectories start at the same time t = 0 and also have the same end
positions qA and qB.

Using eq.(2.7), which is derived from (5.1) as before, we transform the

UHP (5.3) to the form

(5.4)

This is the unconstrained Maupertuis Principle (UMP) for nonconservative
systems, which seems not to have been given in the literature explicitly (it
is implicit in an Appendix in [12] - see also [73]). It relates three variations
- the variation of mean energy ¯E, the variation of the action W and the
variation of the travel time T . The Lagrange multipliers are the true travel
time T and the diﬀerence of energy and mean energy of the true trajectory
at the ﬁnal point, [E(T )

¯E(T )]. The latter can be rewritten as

where the bar and brackets < ... > both denote a time average over the
interval (0,T). The generalized UMP (5.4) can also be derived by traditional
variational procedures ([12], eq.(A.6)).

One can derive constrained principles from (5.4) as before, e.g. (δ ¯E)W,T =
0, but these would be complicated to use in practice because of the severe
constraints on the trial trajectories. The version (δW ) ¯E,T = 0 is closest to
the original Maupertuis Principle. The constrained principle

!E(0),E(T )

is mentioned by Whittaker [75], and is easily derived from (5.4) and (5.5).
But since (5.4) is also valid without ﬁxing E(0) and E(T ) , (5.4) is more
convenient.

35

Formally the unconstrained Maupertuis principle (5.4) is equivalent to
the Hamilton principle, but it also appears too complicated to be useful in
practice. This is not quite true and we demonstrate how the UMP can be
used for adiabatic perturbations.

5.2 Adiabatic Invariants and the Hannay Angle

For simplicity we start with a one-dimensional periodic system that depends
on a parameter λ. Let λ vary with time adiabatically, i.e. the change ∆λ
λ
during a period of oscillation T . It is well known that in this case the energy
E as well as the period of oscillation T depend slightly on time, but the
action I over a cycle, where

≪

I =

remains constant to an excellent approximation (adiabatic invariant) when
the parameter λ varies.

Consider what kind of information can be extracted from the UMP (5.4).
Both the energy E and the period T of an actual motion are functions of the
action I (recall the action-angle variables): E = E(I), T = T (I). Consider
two actual trajectories with actions I and I + dI as two trial trajectories
for the UMP (5.4). Then the variational equation can be rewritten as a

where the averaging < t∂E(I, λ)/∂λ > is to be performed at a ﬁxed value

for any given parameter λ, and hence the derivative ∂E(I, λ)/∂λ is also a

calculate some average frequency over the period. But actually ω(I) is not
always a continuous function of time; it is a global parameter of a (slightly)
aperiodic system. Thus (5.10) is nontrivial in general.

To illustrate these results it is instructive to consider a simple exactly
solvable example. We consider the 1D motion of a perfectly elastic ball of
mass m bouncing between two planes. We suppose that one plane is ﬁxed
and the other is slowly moving with constant velocity u. We suppose also

37

that the planes are heavy enough so that they are unaﬀected by collisions
with the ball. The distance between the two planes L(t) = L0 + ut is the
adiabatic parameter.

→

) = Ln/(vn −

Let us deﬁne a cycle as the motion of the ball from the ﬁxed plane to
the moving plane, collision, and the motion of the ball in the backward
direction up to the collision with the ﬁxed plane. The n-th cycle can be
described in the following way. At time t = 0 (beginning of the cycle)
the ball has velocity vn, and the distance between planes is Ln. At time
u) the ball collides with the moving plane and after the
Tn(
2u) = vn+1 (the
collision it moves to the ﬁxed plane with velocity (vn −
collision with the ﬁxed plane is elastic and the backward velocity is equal to
the forward velocity after collision, i.e. vn+1). The backward motion takes
time Tn(

) = (2Ln)/vn+1. At time t = Tn (the initial time for (n+1)-th
Tn(
cycle) the distance between the two planes is equal to Ln+1 = Lnvn/vn+1.
This means that Lnvn = Ln+1vn+1 is an exact (adiabatic) invariant.
It easy to see that the action I is proportional to this invariant,

The generalization of (5.10) to multidimensional integrable systems with
actions I1,...,If is evident, as is the generalization to multiparameter systems,
with parameters λ1, λ2, ....

The O( ˙λ) corrections in ω(I) have been derived by other methods [77],
but in diﬀerent forms from (5.10). If we assume λ(t) is periodic, with a long
period Tλ, the O( ˙λ) terms in ω(I), when integrated over (0, Tλ), deﬁne the
Hannay angle ∆θH , the classical analogue of the quantum Berry phase [77].
The Hannay angle is the extra (geometric) phase undergone by the system
in one cycle of λ(t), in addition to the more obvious dynamical phase θD ob-
tained by integrating the instantaneous frequency ω(λ(t))
dE(I, λ(t))/dI.
In general one requires more than one λ-type parameter to obtain a non-
vanishing result for ∆θH , but Hannay and Berry and coworkers give a few
examples [77, 78, 79] where one parameter suﬃces. We discuss two examples
with nonvanishing ∆θH .

5.2.1 Bead Sliding on Slowly Rotating Horizontal Ring

Consider a bead of mass m sliding without friction on a closed planar wire
loop which is slowly rotating with angular velocity Ω in the horizontal plane.
For a loop of arbitrary shape, Hannay and Berry [77] show that the Hannay
8π2A/L2, where A is the area
angle ∆θH deﬁned above is given by ∆θH =
and L the perimeter of the loop. For a circular loop rotating about an axis
perpendicular to the plane of the loop and through the center, ∆θH is simply
2π, as is clear intuitively: the “starting line” for the particle moves ahead

by 2π while the particle rapidly slides around the loop.

We consider a circular loop of radius a (Fig.8), but with the vertical axis
of rotation through a point O on the wire instead of the center C of the
loop, to make the answer less obvious. The adiabatic parameter here is the
prescribed orientation of the loop λ(t), where ˙λ(t)
Ω(t) is small. We do
not at this stage assume Ω(t) is constant.

We now assume Ω is constant. For Ω = 0, ¯H is a function of the good
action I = pθ only (no θ dependence), and when Ω

good action. Note that ¯H is independent of angle λ, so that the second term

5.2.2 The Foucault Pendulum

For a Foucault pendulum the Hannay angle is the angle by which the plane
2π cos θ, where θ is
of the pendulum vibration shifts in one day, i.e. ∆φH =
the co-latitude of the point on earth where the pendulum is located. This is a
clockwise rotation in the northern hemisphere. This result for ∆φH has been
derived by Berry [79] and others [80] by various arguments. There are also

some pre-Hannay purely geometric arguments for the Foucault pendulum
precession [81]. Here we show the result follows simply from (5.16).

We consider a pendulum of length L and bob mass m oscillating at a
point on the earth’s surface with co-latitude θ. We use axes x,y,z attached
to the earth, with x,y in the horizontal plane and z vertical. When at rest in
the x,y,z system, the pendulum hangs along the z-axis, and when in motion
the bob oscillates very nearly in the x,y plane. Neglecting the z motion and
ΩE cos θ is small, where ΩE is the earth’s angular velocity, we
assuming Ω
easily ﬁnd [82] the approximate horizontal equations of motion

where ω0 = (g/L)1/2. We have kept the O(Ω) Coriolis terms, but dropped
the O(Ω2) centrifugal terms, since Ω is small compared to the pendulum
frequency ω0. Here Ω is the local vertical component of the earth’s angular
velocity. We are interested in particular in the orbit precession rate predicted
by (5.20).

Hannay angle ∆φH.

The examples in this section and the previous one led to a nonvanishing
Hannay angle ∆θH . It is easy to show that the earlier example (particle in

a 1D box with a slowly moving wall) gives a vanishing result. The same is
true for a particle in a slowly rotating 1D box (ﬁxed walls). Golin [85] has
proved that, for 1D systems with one adiabatic parameter λ, one always has
∆θH = 0 unless λ undergoes a rotational excursion through 2π. However the
proof does not cover our rotating 1D box example (which has a hard wall
potential), since Golin [85] assumes a smooth potential. The case of a slowly
rotating 2D box of elliptical shape has been worked out by Koiller [80], and
gives a nonvanishing ∆θH depending in a complicated way on the area of the
box.

5.2.3 Nonintegrable Systems

Nonintegrable systems have fewer than f independent constants of the mo-
tion or good actions, where f is the number of degrees of freedom. For such
systems, at least some of the possible motions are chaotic, and for these at
least some of the good action variables do not exist. Hence we have not been
able to proceed rigorously beyond the general relation (5.4) for chaotic mo-
tions. (Despite the nonexistence of good actions I for nonintegrable systems,
formal use of them and their adiabatic invariance have been used success-
fully in semiclassical quantization schemes; see sections 2.3, 3.1, 4.1, 4.3 and
ref.
[13] for a method based on the Maupertuis Principles for conservative
systems, and see refs. [91, 92] for a method based on adiabatic switching.)

As stated, we do not have rigorous arguments to draw consequences from
the UMP (5.4) for nonintegrable systems, but some heuristic arguments can
be given. For example, by choosing H(λ(t)) to vary slowly and linearly with
t, e.g. H(λ(t)) = λ(t)H0(q, p) = (1 + ˙λt)H0(q, p), where ˙λ is small, we can
derive the adiabatic invariance of the action I for a 1D periodic system (ear-
lier we assumed that I is an adiabatic invariant for such systems). Further,
by considering long trajectories of multidimensional systems, which start and
end in some small region in phase space, and which are not quite periodic
in general, we can formally show that, in a Poincar´e cycle time or in the
the long-path action W is an adiabatic invariant for quasiperi-
limit T
odic and chaotic trajectories of multidimensional systems. Ehrenfest [95] has
previously shown that W is an adiabatic invariant for multidimensional pe-
riodic systems. For ergodic systems, the phase volume Ω(E) is an adiabatic
invariant (see next paragraph), and since the adiabatic invariant is appar-
ently unique for such systems (Kasuga [90]), it should be possible to derive
the adiabatic invariance of W from that of Ω for these systems, but we have

→ ∞

44

been so far unable to do this [86]. We note that counterparts of the Hannay
angle have been established for adiabatically evolving nonintegrable [88] and
ergodic [89] systems.

For one limiting case, complete chaos (ergodic motion) where the energy
is the only constant of the motion, and long trajectories typically cover es-
sentially the whole energy surface, a rigorous adiabatic invariant has been
found [90, 91, 93], i.e. the phase volume Ω(E), enclosed by the energy surface
H(q, p) = E:

Ω(E) =

dqdpΘ[E

Z

−

(5.31)

(For

where Θ is the step function, which is unity for positive argument.
multidimensional systems, dqdp stands for dq1dq2...dqf dp1dp2...dpf .)

If H(q, p, λ(t)) depends on a slowly varying parameter λ(t) so that E =
E(λ(t)), then Ω(E(λ(t))) = Ω(E(λ(0))). The adiabatic invariance of Ω(E)
is intuitively plausible [94]. First consider the initial (t = 0) energy surface
H(q, p, λ(0)) = E(λ(0)), and its image under an arbitrary time development
(i.e.not necessarily slow). The ﬁnal (image) surface at the time T is not
in general a constant energy surface, and hence not in general a dynamical
surface. However, by Liouville’s theorem the volume enclosed by the ﬁnal sur-
face is equal to that enclosed by the initial surface. If the time-development
from t = 0 to t = T is suﬃciently slow then at each stage the surface which
has evolved from the t = 0 surface is a dynamical surface, by deﬁnition of
adiabatic evolution, where allowed motions transform into allowed motions
[95]. In this case the ﬁnal t = T surface is a true constant energy dynamical
surface, and hence Ω(E(λ(T ))) = Ω(E(λ(0))) from Liouville’s theorem .

For ergodic systems, there are no good quantum numbers except for the
energy-ordering quantum number N = 1, 2, ..., where E1 < E2 < .... A
rough but useful semiclassical quantization scheme for ergodic systems based
on Ω(E) is the Weyl rule [93]

Ω(EN ) = Nhf ,

(5.32)

which implicitly deﬁnes EN . This is just a restatement of the early rule
due to Planck [96] that each quantum state occupies a volume of size hf in
classical phase space. In practice, various improvements such as replacing
N by (N + α) as in (2.4) are used [93]. More subtle improvements can be
obtained from Gutzwiller’s trace formula [28]. These relate ﬂuctuations from

45

the smooth dependence of E on N predicted by (5.32) to the classical pe-
riodic orbits. In cases such as the x2y2 potential, where the classical Ω(E)
diverges [98] due to the inﬁnite channels of the potential (see Fig.1), one
can estimate the smooth part of N(E) ( the cumulative number of states up
to E) quantum mechanically [97] at low energy by an asymptotic expansion
[98], with leading terms ε3/2 log ε and ε3/2, where ε = E(m2/¯h4C)1/3 is di-
mensionless. Application of the generalization of (5.32), i.e. N(EN ) = N,
then gives reasonable estimates of the low-lying state energies [36, 98].

5.3 The Classical Hellmann - Feynman Theorem

Another consequence of the UMP (5.4) is the classical version of the Hellmann
- Feynman theorem [99]

∂E(I, λ)
∂λ

=<

∂H(q, p, λ)

(5.33)

Here H(q, p, λ) depends on a parameter λ, so that the energy E(I, λ) depends
on λ, as well as on the (constant) action I, and < ... >I denotes a time-
average over a period T (I) at ﬁxed action I. We assume a one-dimensional
periodic system for simplicity.

The quantum version of the theorem [100] is nowadays much better

known, i.e.

instead from the RMP (2.3) for conservative systems. We apply (2.3) to two
periodic trajectories of H(λ), the true one with period T (λ), and a virtual
one taken as the true trajectory of H(λ + ∆λ) with period T (λ + ∆λ) . Since
ﬁrst-order variations in ¯E

< H(λ) > vanish (at ﬁxed W = 2πI), we have

≡

< H(λ) >λ+∆λ=< H(λ) >λ +O(∆λ2),

(5.36)

where < ... >λ is an average over the trajectory with period T (λ), and it is
understood that I is the same for both < ... >λ and < ... >λ+∆λ. From (5.36)
we get for ∆ ¯E

∆ ¯E =< H(λ + ∆λ) >λ+∆λ −

∆ ¯E =< H(λ + ∆λ)

Eq(5.37) yields ∂ ¯E/∂λ =< ∂H(λ)/∂λ >λ, and since ¯E = E for the true
trajectory we get ∂E/∂λ =< ∂H(λ)/∂λ >λ, the Hellmann-Feynman relation

H(λ) >λ .

As a simple example of (5.33) consider a 1D harmonic oscillator, with
Hamiltonian H(x, p) = p2/2m + kx2/2 and E(I) = Iω, where ω = (k/m)1/2
is the angular frequency. Choose λ = k, the force constant. The left side
of (5.33) is E/2k and the right side is < x2/2 >=< V > /k. Thus we have
< V >= E/2, as is well known from the virial theorem [5]. If we choose
λ = m, we ﬁnd similarly < K >= E/2.

As a second example, consider the bound motion of a 1D system with
x′, p′ via
Hamiltonian H(x, p) = p2/2m + V (x). We change variables x, p
the transformation x′ = λx, p′ = p/λ, where λ is an arbitrary scale factor.
This transformation is canonical and preserves the Hamiltonian [101], i.e.
H(x, p) = Hλ(x′, p′), where

6 Variational Principles in Relativistic Me-

chanics

Hamilton’s Principle is widely used in Classical Relativistic Mechanics and
in the Classical Theory of Electromagnetic and Gravitational Fields to derive
covariant equations of motion (see, e.g.[102]). As for Maupertuis’ Principle,
it is widely believed that it is not well suited for that purpose because when
operating with the energy one loses explicit covariance. In this section we
demonstrate, ﬁrst, how to use Maupertuis’ Principle for the derivation of the
covariant equations of motion and, the second, how to use it for the solution
of speciﬁc problems.

Consider a relativistic particle with mass m and charge e moving in an
arbitrary external electromagnetic ﬁeld, described by a four-potential with
contravariant components Aα = (A0, Ai) = (φ, Ai), and covariant compo-
nents Aα = (A0,
Ai), where φ and Ai (for i = 1, 2, 3) are the
usual scalar and vector potentials. Hamilton’s Action for this system can be

unchanged. The HP is thus gauge invariant.

If we introduce a parameter τ along the four-dimensional path (proper
time s along the true or any particular virtual path are valid choices) the
action S can be rewritten in the form

S = m

Z

(6.2)

where vα = dxα/dτ .
In general, τ is both frame-independent and path-
independent. A path-independent parameter is here invaluable for variational
purposes, since we then do not have to vary the parameter when we vary the
path. After the variations have been performed, we can then choose τ = s,
etc. The limits of the integrals are the invariants τA and τB. With respect
to parameter τ we get the covariant Lagrangian

and corresponding conjugate momenta

L = m[vαvα]1/2 + evαAα,

Thus in this particular covariant treatment the Hamiltonian is trivial.

momenta are not independent variables but satisfy the constraint

which is obvious from (6.4). This constraint can be taken into account with

On the other hand the Hamilton equations with Hef f are equivalent to
the MP or to the RMP with the same Hef f . Thus one can use any of the
four Variational Principles (HP, RHP, GMP, RMP) either with Lagrangian
(6.3) or with eﬀective Hamiltonian (6.7) for the derivation of the covariant
equations of motion. It is to be noted that in the covariant formulation of
relativistic mechanics, the Hamiltonian (a Lorentz scalar) is not equal to the
energy ( the time component of a four-vector). Thus ¯E in the Maupertuis
Principle must be interpreted as

τA. By contrast, in the noncovariant formulation discussed

τ = τB −

△

There are other, related, formal diﬃculties arising from (6.5). This con-
dition (H = 0) is due to the fact that the Lagrangian L in (6.3) is homoge-
neous and of ﬁrst degree in vα (i.e. essentially linear in velocities vα), so that
L (the Hamiltonian)
vα∂L/∂vα = L and hence the diﬀerence vα∂L/∂vα −
vanishes [104]. Since H = 0, the Legendre transform relation (6.5) between
L and H simpliﬁes to

L = pαvα,

and hence the Legendre transform relation between W and S, i.e. W

All these diﬃculties can be traced to the well studied diﬃculty [5, 103,
105, 106, 107] of applying an action principle with kinematic [109] non-
holonomic constraints, such as (6.6) for the momenta, or for the velocities
vαvα = 1 for proper time s, or vαvα = (ds/dτ )2 for arbitrary parameter τ .

One way out of the diﬃculties is to introduce the constraint with a La-
grange multiplier for either the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian (as is done above
for Hef f ). Another way out is to exploit the nonuniqueness of the Lagrangian.
For example [105], the covariant Lagrangian L (6.3) is equivalent to the co-
, where (with τ as parameter)
variant Lagrangian L

(6.12)

(6.13)

(6.14)

where λ(τ ) = dτ /ds.
It is easily veriﬁed that (6.12) generates the same
Euler-Lagrange equations of motion as (6.3). For τ = s (the proper time of
the path in question), (6.12) simpliﬁes to

L′ = λ(τ )

vαvα + evαAα,

m
2

L′ =

vαvα + evαAα,

m

which is often employed [5, 106]. The advantage of (6.12) and (6.13) is
that they are nonhomogeneous in vα, and hence will generate a nontrivial
corresponding Hamiltonian H ′. For (6.13), for example, we ﬁnd

H ′ =

1
2m

(pα −

eAα)(pα

eAα).

−

Note that H ′ (6.14) and Hef f (6.7) (for τ = s) diﬀer only by a constant. Use
of the covariant L′ and H ′ in place of L and H removes the diﬃculties of
using all four variational principles (HP, RHP, GMP, RMP). For L and H,
only the ﬁrst two can be used. Note again that ¯E is computed from H ′ as in
(6.9), with H ′ in place of Hef f .

Now we come to the question of the solution of speciﬁc physical problems.
In this case explicit covariance usually is not of great importance and it is
more useful to ﬁnd an appropriate convenient frame. For any given frame
we can choose τ = t (the coordinate time) and obtain the complete set of
nontrivial quantities

The expression for L in (6.15) is derived from (6.3) or (6.12) by choosing

with the standard choice in the noncovariant case [5]. Again we have chosen

use one principle or another. From a practical point of view there is no
diﬀerence in the usage of variational principles in nonrelativistic mechanics
and in relativistic mechanics in a given frame.

As an example of the usage of the GMP for relativistic mechanics consider
the motion of an electron in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B = (0, 0, B). A
A = 0) is A =
corresponding vector potential in the Coulomb gauge (
B
yB/2, xB/2, 0) [116]. The solution of (6.8) in this case
is well known - the electron moves with constant velocity along the direction
of the ﬁeld (along the z-axis in our case) and along a circular orbit in the xy
plane with the cyclotron frequency

where ω and A are free parameters. After some simple algebra we get

In this case it seems that an economical method is to use the GMP (2.2).
For this purpose one has to rewrite W as a function of ¯E

¯E
and to calculate the variation δW at ﬁxed ¯E. The GMP (2.2) translates here
to (∂W /∂ω) ¯E = 0. One then easily ﬁnds the analytical solution

relativistic systems.

(7.2)

the time-independent Schr¨odinger equation. Details of the proof of (7.1)
(which is straightforward only for integrable systems) are given in [12]. In
ref.[119] it is explained how Schr¨odinger, in his ﬁrst paper on wave mechanics
in 1926, in essence worked backwards, i.e. starting from the right hand side of
(7.1), he “derived” the left hand side, and thereby discovered wave mechanics.
In his second paper on wave mechanics in 1926 he retracted this argument
because his version of the right hand side of (7.1) was not quite correct. In
this second paper he presented an alternative argument as a basis for wave
mechanics (now in the standard textbooks) based on the analogy between
geometric and wave optics on the one hand, and particle and wave mechanics
on the other.

We consider now the generalization of (7.1) to nonstationary states ψ(t),
where the true dynamical states satisfy the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equa-
tion

i¯h∂tψ(t) = ˆHψ(t),

(7.3)

where ∂t = ∂/∂t, and the initial state ψ(0) is given. For notational simplicity
we consider a single particle in three dimensions, so that ψ = ψ(r, t), and

ˆH = K + V =

. The arguments which follow are also

where K = p2/2m and p = (¯h/i)

∇

We shall consider here the quantum time-dependent variational principle
due to Frenkel and Dirac [120, 121, 122] for the wave function ψ(t), but we
note the existence of other quantum time-dependent variational principles,
e.g. for the time-evolution operator and transition amplitudes [123], for the
Heisenberg operator version [124] and for the matrix mechanics version [125]
of the Hamilton Principle, for the density matrix [126], for the mean value of
an arbitrary observable [127], and for time-dependent density functional the-
ory [128]. ( For completeness, we note that there are also other [130] quantum
time-independent variational principles, in addition to that of Schr¨odinger.)

The original Frenkel-Dirac variational principle is [120]

i¯h∂t|
for arbitrary variations δψ(r, t) around the true dynamical state ψ(r, t). Since
(7.5) is true for all possible variations δψ, then ( ˆH

δ
Ldt = 0, because of the right hand side. It is more like the unconstrained
principles discussed earlier. Some authors drop the right hand side without
comment [132], but it is required if arbitrary variations δψ in ψ are allowed;
otherwise (7.7) will not generate the Schr¨odinger equation (7.3) and its com-
plex conjugate [129]. It is possible to obtain a vanishing right-hand side by
restricting the variations δψ in various ways [133], e.g. requiring the trial
wave functions ψ(t) to be normalized at all times. Another way is to write
ψ(T ) >∗, formally regard ψ and its
the right hand side as
|
complex conjugate ψ∗ as independent (see below), and assume ψ∗(T ) (as
well as ψ(0)) is ﬁxed. However, we ﬁnd it simplest to retain the general form
(7.7), with no constraints on ψ(t) except for the ﬁxing of the initial condition
ψ(0). (When dealing explicitly with bound states later, we assume boundary
conditions on ψ(r, t).)

This is the continuity equation, reﬂecting conservation of total probability,
S = p = mv is the momentum of the particle. Note that if the
since [138]
right hand side of (7.13) were missing, we would not get the correct continu-
ity equation. In contrast to what we have done here, Feynman [132] keeps
the ¯h terms in (7.11), and the variational principle then leads to quantum
generalizations [137] of the Hamilton - Jacobi (7.14) and continuity (7.17)
equations.

Thus we see that the classical limit of the quantum time-dependent vari-
ational principle is the classical variational principle for the Hamilton-Jacobi
and continuity equations.
Interestingly the classical limit of the quantum
time-dependent variational principle leads to a classical variational principle
for the Hamilton action S along the true trajectories, whereas the classical
limit of the quantum time-independent variational principle in the form of
the left side of (7.1) leads to a classical variational principle for the trajecto-
ries themselves (RMP -the right side of (7.1)). An alternative form [139] of
the quantum time-independent variational principle,

transformation to ψ(r), i.e.

ψ(r) = A(r)eiW (r)/¯h ,
where A(r) is the amplitude and W (r) the phase. Following similar steps as

8 Summary and Conclusions

We summarize the two groups of classical variational principles reviewed in
this paper. First we have the Maupertuis principles:

δW

−

T δ ¯E = 0, (δW ) ¯E = 0, (δ ¯E)W = 0.

(8.1)

58

The ﬁrst of these is the unconstrained form (UMP), the second the general
Maupertuis principle (GMP), and the third is the reciprocal Maupertuis
principle (RMP). By Legendre transformation of the principles in (8.1) we
obtain the Hamilton principles:

δS + EδT = 0, (δS)T = 0, (δT )S = 0.

(8.2)

The ﬁrst is the unconstrained form (UHP), the second the Hamilton principle
(HP), and the third the reciprocal Hamilton principle (RHP). In all these
principles, the end-positions of the trajectory qA and qB are held ﬁxed, and
the notation indicates what else is ﬁxed and what is varied.

We have given a number of examples showing how to use these principles
to solve practical problems, focussing particularly on the three Maupertuis
principles. Both classical and semiclassical applications have been given, and
some comparisons are made with the results from quantum variational prin-
ciple calculations. The classical limits of two quantum variational principles
(time-dependent and time-independent) are given. In particular, the RMP is
the classical limit of the Schr¨odinger time-independent quantum variational
principle. The RMP is thereby naturally adapted to semiclassical applica-
tions

In the applications, the variational principles ( both classical and quan-
tum) are solved by the direct variational method, where one guesses a trial
solution containing adjustable parameters, and adjusts the parameters to
satisfy the variational principle. The Euler-Lagrange diﬀerential equation is
not required in this method. When we choose a simple trial solution, the
results can be found simply and analytically.

Using the direct variational method the RMP and UMP have been used
to estimate semiclassically the energy levels in several examples. The lev-
els En1,n2, ... can be expressed in analytical form, and the accuracy is quite
acceptable in most cases, even for nonintegrable systems which are usually
treated by much more complicated semiclassical methods, e.g. the Gutzwiller
trace formula [28], or quantizing the Birkhoﬀ-Gustavson normal form [141].
It would be useful to have comparisons of the results from the Maupertuis
Principle-based method with those from the latter two and other methods
for a number of speciﬁc problems. The methods should be compared for ac-
curacy of results and computational complexity. Some limited comparisons
of the Maupertuis Principle and normal form methods have been done for
the x2y2 oscillator of sec. 4.1 in refs.
[58, 68], and limited comparisons for

59

this model of results from the Maupertuis Principle and the semiclassical
adiabatic methods [35] are presented in Table 1 of sec. 4.1.1, but much more
extensive comparisons would be of interest.

Variational principles appeal to various individuals for diﬀering reasons,
both aesthetic [142] and practical. We have stressed the utility for classical
and semiclassical particle dynamics calculations in this review. Engineers
too make heavy use of variational principles in solving practical problems of
classical continuum mechanics [143]. On rare occasions variational principles
have even led to new laws of physics [144].

“... since δy is the variation of y with x kept constant, we could conveniently
write it as (δy)x, in accordance with a convention used in thermodynamics...
It is curious that in spite of the obvious need in partial diﬀerentiation for
precise statement of what is being kept constant, such statement is not em-
bodied in customary notation of pure mathematics, though it is provided in
thermodynamics,...”

Variational problems ask for the function which makes stationary an inte-
gral involving the function and its derivatives. Usually there is a constraint
which is ﬁxed. For example, we are to ﬁnd a function y(x), describing a
closed planar curve, of ﬁxed length L, which maximizes the area A enclosed

60

by the curve y(x). A and L are functionals of y(x): A = A[y(x)], L = L[y(x)].
For our purpose here, we do not need the precise form of A or L. L is the
constraint and A is the functional to be varied. We use the following notation
to describe this variation

(δA)L = 0,

(A1.1)

where the constraint L is indicated as a subscript on the bracket enclosing
the variation δA of the functional A. The variation δA is ﬁrst-order in δy,
and is called the ﬁrst variation when higher-order variations are considered
[15] . The constraint L is denoted explicitly in (A1.1) because it is the most
important, or the one we wish to focus on. There may be other constraints
which are left implicit, e.g. that the planar curve pass through a given point
(xB, yB).
In this paper we always leave ﬁxed end-position constraints on
curves (closed or open) implicit.

The solution of the problem (A1.1) is the function y(x), which satisﬁes a
diﬀerential equation, the Euler-Lagrange equation. The reciprocal variational
problem has the constraint L and the varied functional A interchanged. In
other words, it is described by the equation

(δL)A = 0.

(A1.2)

The two equations, (A1.1) and (A1.2), have the same solution y(x). The
reciprocal variation is searching for the function y(x) which makes stationary
(here minimizes) the length L of a closed curve with ﬁxed enclosed area A.
The common solution for both problems is a circle, as is clear intuitively.
One way to prove reciprocity is to use a trick, due to Lagrange, called the
method of Lagrange multipliers. The problem (A1.1) is ﬁrst restated in
unconstrained form as

δA

λδL = 0,

−

(A1.3)

where the variations of both A and L are unconstrained and λ is an unde-
termined multiplier. To obtain (A1.2) from (A1.3), we simply specify that
we now ﬁx A (i.e. set δA = 0) and vary L, i.e. (δL)A = 0. This proves the
reciprocity theorem.

Reciprocity is clear intuitively in the isoperimetric problem (A1.1). An
example of reciprocity from physics is the Gibbs conditions for equilibrium in
thermodynamics [117]. The reciprocal conditions (δS)U = 0 and (δU)S = 0
are both conditions for thermal equilibrium, where S is the entropy and U the
internal energy. These express the facts that the state of thermal equilibrium

61

is that state which maximizes the entropy for ﬁxed internal energy, and also
is that state which minimizes the internal energy for ﬁxed entropy.
(The
unconstrained form [145] is δU
T δS = 0, where the Lagrange multiplier is
the temperature T . Here the implicit constraints in all cases are ﬁxed system
volume V and mole numbers Nα) Reciprocal VP’s in mechanics have only
recently been studied [12, 13] - see Sec.2.

This is all we shall need from the calculus of variations; for more details

one should consult a text-book [146].

11 Appendix II. Equivalence of the Mauper-

tuis and General Maupertuis Principles

In Sec. 2.2, for conservative systems, we discussed the equivalence of the
Hamilton Principle (HP)

with the General Maupertuis Principle (GMP)

Here we show directly the equivalence of the GMP (A2.2) with the original
Maupertuis Principle (MP)

In all these principles the end-positions qA and qB are held ﬁxed. Since
(A2.1), (A2.2) and (A2.3) all generate the same (Euler-Lagrange) equations
of motion, it is clear they must be equivalent, and it is interesting to show
directly the equivalence of (A2.2) and (A2.3). We must show that relaxing
the constraint of ﬁxed E in (A2.3) to ﬁxed ¯E in (A2.2) does not generate
spurious or unphysical solutions.

The constraint of ﬁxed E = H(q, p) in (A2.3) applies along and between
the trial trajectories. To relax this constraint, we use the method of Lagrange
multipliers [147]. Since H(q, p) = const, we have δH = 0 , and hence

(δS)T = 0,

(δW ) ¯E = 0.

(δW )E = 0.

Expanding (A2.6) gives

δW = λ ¯EδT + λT δ ¯E

λEδT.

−

(A2.7)

(A2.8)

The ﬁrst and third terms on the right hand side of (A2.7) cancel, since
¯E = E = const on the true trajectory, as assumed in the MP (A2.3).This
means

δW = λT δ ¯E.

To see that λ = 1 in (A2.8), we apply (A2.8) to the special case of two true
trajectories, with actions W and W + dW and energies E and E + dE. For
this case (A2.8) reads ∂W/∂E = λT . Comparison of this with the standard
relation [5] ∂W/∂E = T gives λ = 1. Hence we have

δW = T δ ¯E,
(A2.9)
which is the unconstrained Maupertuis Principle (UMP) (2.10). Fixing ¯E in
(A2.9) then gives (A2.2), the GMP.

Thus (A2.2) follows from (A2.3). The converse, the derivation of (A2.3)
from (A2.2) is easy; we simply restrict the trial trajectories in (A2.2) to those
of ﬁxed energy E, since the equations of motion following from (A2.2) imply
energy conservation. Hence (A2.2) and (A2.3) are equivalent.

We note once more that conservation of energy is assumed in the original

MP (A2.3), whereas it is a consequence of the general MP (A2.2).

for invariant tori to cantori: 1980 Amer. Inst. Phys. Conf. Proc. 55 302.
A cantorus is, roughly speaking, a torus-shaped surface with holes such
that what remains forms a Cantor set of points. A trajectory conﬁned
to a torus surface is quasiperiodic. A trajectory starting on a cantorus
will slowly “leak away” because of the holes, hence is not conﬁned to the
surface so that the quasiperiodicity is destroyed in the long run, and is
thus weakly chaotic. See Arnold et al [108], p.194, for a precise deﬁnition.

If end-position variations are allowed, as well as end-time variations, the
HAδtA),
UHP (2.8) generalizes to δS = (pBδqB −
where pB is the true value of p at end-point B, etc, and for conserva-
tive systems HA = HB = E. ( This generalization can be derived from
the general ﬁrst variational theorem [29] of variational calculus, which
includes end-point variations - see Appendix A of [12] for a related dis-
cussion of the UMP.) What Hamilton termed the law of varying action
is the special case for the variation between two true trajectories, so that
δS = dS, δpi = dpi and δti = dti are exact diﬀerentials.

[26] This particular analogy can be pushed further. Just as there are numer-
ous other thermodynamic potentials besides the Helmholtz free energy
F and the Gibbs free energy G = F + pV , (where p is the pressure
and V the volume), e.g. the internal energy U = F + T S, (where T is
the temperature and S the entropy), we can introduce in mechanics fur-
ther actions via further Legendre transformations. For example, deﬁne
S
pBqB, where qB is the ﬁnal end-point position and pB the true
momentum at B. If we relax the constraint of ﬁxed qB, the UHP gener-
alizes further to δS =
this transforms to
δS

, the usual fully constrained HP is
(δS

qA is still left implicit in both. Further Legendre (using pA, qA and/or
W ) and reciprocal transformations are obvious. In this review we focus
on the four basic variational principles summarized at the end of sec.2.2.

[30] The direct method described in the text originates with Ritz (precursors

due to Hamilton and Rayleigh).

Euler ﬁrst described the method of discretizing time in the action in-
tegral, treating the q(ti) as discrete variables, and obtaining discretized
(ﬁnite diﬀerence) versions of the Euler-Lagrange (and Newton) equa-
tions, to be solved with the two end-positions and the duration ﬁxed.
This method has also been much used in recent years: see, e.g., Percival
1991 [20]; Beck T L, Doll J D and Freeman D L 1989 J. Chem. Phys. 90
3181; Basille A G and Gray C G 1992 J.Comp.Phys. 101 80; Marsden

metric, Control and Numerical Aspects of Nonholonomic Systems (New
York: Springer) p 143; Elber R, C´ardenas A, Ghosh A and Stern H A
2003 Adv. Chem. Phys. 126 93.

Courant R (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 49, 1 (1943)) was one of the ﬁrst to
suggest spacial discretization of variational functionals involving ﬁelds
φ(r), a precursor to the modern ﬁnite element method ( Ram-Mohan,
ref.[1] ) which uses a basis of localized trial functions.

[31] Unfortunately, in some good textbooks the authors misapply the original
MP (δW )E = 0 for 1D problems by employing trial trajectories which
do not conserve the energy E: see, e.g., Tabarrok and Rimrott [115],
p. 180, or Park D 1990 Classical Dynamics and its Quantum Analogues

[38] The RMP method yields ωx/ωy = Wy/Wx and hence after semiclassical
quantization ωx/ωy = (ny + 1
2)/(nx + 1
2) , the same as (4.7) found by the
fully quantum VP. Since ωx/ωy is therefore rational, the optimum quan-
tized trajectories are periodic, at least at this level of approximation.
Periodic trajectories also play a key role in Gutzwiller’s trace formula
method of semiclassical quantization [28].

These workers go beyond the Rayleigh dissipation function method [5],
and incorporate the friction into the Lagrangian (or Hamiltonian). For
example, for a harmonic oscillator with linear damping (equation of mo-
tion m¨x + β ˙x + kx = 0), one easily veriﬁes that a suitable Lagrangian is
L(x, ˙x, t) = exp(βt/m)[m ˙x2/2
kx2/2], and the corresponding Hamil-
tonian is H(x, p, t) = exp(

βt/m)p2/2m + exp(βt/m)kx2/2.

MP), and our δT is replaced by a dλ term. Ehrenfest attributes his result
to Boltzmann and Clausius.

As before, in the UMP (5.4) we have ﬁxed the initial time tA = 0 and
allow the ﬁnal time tB ≡
T to vary. If both tA and tB are allowed to vary,
(5.4) generalizes to T δ ¯E
¯E]δtA = 0.
[E(tB)
This reduces to (5.4) for ﬁxed tA, and to (2.10) for conservative systems
(E(tA) = E(tB) = ¯E). Further generalizations, allowing qB and/or qA
to vary, are discussed in notes [25, 26]

from an assumed adiabatic in-

The adiabatic invariance of long-path W ’s for ergodic systems follows
heuristically from the UMP (5.4) as described in the text. Alternatively,
we can heuristically argue that for T

tially closed in phase space, so that the Poincar´e dynamical invariant

surface and the path on it slowly evolve. Obviously the limiting proce-
dures are delicate and problematic. Even if our conjecture is true, the
adiabatic invariance may appear to be of the seemingly uninformative
. To extract ﬁnite results, T

will need to be taken as, say, the Poincar´e cycle time. We note that,
in another situation where W

useful results can still be extracted [12].

The arguments in the above paragraph, as well as the one in the text,
apply also more generally to the chaotic motions of nonergodic nonin-
tegrable systems. Since adiabatic invariants have not been found pre-
viously for such systems, it would be of interest to prove, or disprove,
these suggestions. If proven, it would then be of interest to establish
a general semiclassical quantization scheme for nonintegrable systems
based on W (generalizing (5.32) which holds for ergodic systems).

For periodic systems Ehrenfest [95] showed that the classical Hellmann-
Feynman theorem is equivalent to the adiabatic invariance of the action
W . Ehrenfest (who was Boltzmann’s student) attributes this result to
Boltzmann and Clausius.

The classical theorem can also be derived (Epstein [100]) from classical
perturbation theory, using the result (Ter Haar [111], p.156) that the
ﬁrst-order energy shift ∆E due to a small change in the Hamiltonian
H(λ) by the amount (∂H/∂λ)∆λ is ∆E =< (∂H/∂λ)∆λ >λ.

Our derivation, and that of Epstein [100], allow λ to occur anywhere
in the Hamiltonian. Other explicit published derivations assume λ oc-
curs in the potential. Implicit derivations are contained in a number of
places: Van Vleck J H 1926 Quantum Principles and Line Spectra, Bull.
Nat.Res. Council, Vol. 10 Part 4, p 205; Becker [90], p 129; M¨unster
[90], p51; Landau and Lifshitz [83], p 155.

The classical and quantum dynamical Hellmann-Feynman relations can
be generalized to statistical mechanical relations; for systems in thermal
equilibrium we ﬁnd ∂F /∂λ =< ∂H/∂λ > , where F is the Helmholtz
free energy and < ... > denotes a ( classical or quantum ) canonical en-
semble average. See Gubbins K E and Gray C G 1984 Theory of Molecu-
lar Fluids (Oxford: Oxford U.P.) p 236, and references therein. Thus in
statistical mechanics we do not have ∂ < H >/∂λ =< ∂H/∂λ > in the
canonical ensemble; the correct relation is ∂ < H >/∂λ =< ∂H/∂λ >

ensemble, where H =< H >= E because of the absence of energy ﬂuc-
tuations, we do ﬁnd ∂E/∂λ =< ∂H/∂λ >, both classically and quantum
mechanically.)

[109] Nonholonomic constraints fi(q, ˙q, t) = 0 contain the velocities ˙qα, such
that the constraints cannot be integrated up to global coordinate con-
straints gi(q, t) = 0. Kinematic nonholonomic constraints arise from in-
troducing redundant variables as in sec.6 on relativistic mechanics, or by
introducing constants of the motion as constraints [110] as in App.II for
the MP, or by imposing the kinematic constraint between ˙q and the ve-
locity or the momentum after ﬁrst having released the constraint [111].
Dynamic nonholonomic constraints arise from physical forces of con-
straint, such as arise in rolling motion [112]. Kinematic nonholonomic
i λifi,
constraints can be handled by an eﬀective Lagrangian Lef f = L+
where λi are Lagrange multipliers [103, 106, 107]. Dynamic nonholo-
nomic constraints cannot be handled by such an eﬀective Lagrangian
(contrary to what is stated in some excellent textbooks) and construc-
tion of an HP or MP is highly problematic [115].

[118] There are various ways to constrain the variation so that ψn is selected.

In principle, one can minimize the energy < ψ
the trial ψ’s restricted to be orthogonal to the exact ψ0, ψ1, ..., ψn−1. In
practice, since ψ0, ψ1, ..., ψn−1 are rarely known exactly, one can ﬁnd an
approximate ψn by choosing trial ψ’s with n nodes (for 1D problems).
Alternatively, one can choose a trial ψ which is known to be the nth
eigenstate of a similar Hamiltonian (see sec. 3.1 for an example).

other possible variations). If there are no end-state parameter variations,
then δ ˆS = 0 and hence δ < qB, tB|

relation with the classical HP is clearer when we write the classical HP
as δS(qB, tB; qA, tA) = 0.

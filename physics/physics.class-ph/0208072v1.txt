Singularity-Free Electrodynamics for Point Charges and Dipoles:
Classical Model for Electron Self-Energy and Spin

It is shown how point charges and point dipoles with ﬁnite self-energies can be accomodated into
classical electrodynamics. The key idea is the introduction of constitutive relations for the electro-
magnetic vacuum, which actually mirrors the physical reality of vacuum polarization. Our results
reduce to conventional electrodynamics for scales large compared to the classical electron radius
−13 cm. A classical simulation for a structureless electron is proposed, with the
r0 ≈ 2.8 × 10
appropriate values of mass, spin and magnetic moment.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The most elementary problems in classical electrody-
namics are likely to involve point charges, point dipoles
and other tractable mathematical idealizations of phys-
ical reality. But the simplicity of these solutions often
obscures a subtle but pervasive conceptual ﬂaw. This
appears even in the most elementary formula of electro-
statics, Coulomb’s law of force between two point charges
q1 and q2 separated by a distance r

with the corresponding energy of interaction

F =

q1 q2
r2

W =

q1 q2
r

(1)

(2)

What if we want to know the hypothetical force a point
charge would exert on itself? Since we would then have
r = 0 in these equations, this force becomes inﬁnitely
large, as does the self-energy—the energy of interaction
of the point charge with its own electric ﬁeld. For the
most part, these diﬃculties have been “swept under the
rug” since electrically-charged bodies in real life have a
ﬁnite size. A point charge is perhaps just an abstraction.
Still, it would be highly desirable, even for purely aes-
thetic reasons, to remove this imperfection from the oth-
erwise beautiful and complete ediﬁce of Maxwell’s elec-
trodynamics. Dimensionlesss point charges are in fact
the paradigm for representing fundamental particles in
quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory. And all
experimental evidence from high-energy physics appears
to support such models. For example, recent high-energy
electron-positron scattering experiments imply an upper
limit of 2

10−16 cm on the radius of the electron.

The strategy we pursue invokes constitutive relations.
Usually, these are phenomenological parameters which
represent properties of matter, serving as inputs to
Maxwell’s equations, not implied by the stucture of elec-
trodynamics itself. In certain favorable instances, these

parameters can be determined theoretically from quan-
tum theories of matter. The idea which we will exploit is
to attribute constitutive properties to the vacuum. Ac-
cording to quantum ﬁeld theory, the ultramicroscopic
vicinity of an elementary charged particle is a seething
maelstrom of virtual electron-positron pairs (and other
particles and antiparticles) ﬂashing in and out of exis-
tence. To take account of this well-established physi-
cal reality, a phenomenological representation for vacuum
polarization is introduced within the framework of clas-
sical electrodynamics. As we will show, such a model en-
ables a consistent picture of classical point charges with
ﬁnite electromagnetic self-energy. We must emphasize
that the model is intended in a purely classical context
and will not necessarily be in agreement with details of
quantum electrodynamics. In the same sense, continuum
models for dielectric media can be extremely successful
without taking account of the underlying atomic nature
of matter.

II. SELF-ENERGY OF A POINT CHARGE

The energy contained in an electromagnetic ﬁeld is

given by

W =

In a rest frame, the ﬁeld produced by a point charge e in
vacuum is represented by D = E = eˆr/r2, B = H = 0.
For concreteness, let the particle be an electron. The
electromagnetic self-energy is then given by

The result is inﬁnite unless a lower cutoﬀ is introduced—
in which case the electron acquires a ﬁnite size, as in the
models proposed by Thomson, Lorentz, Abraham and
others a century ago[1]. With a radius of the order of
10−13 cm, known as the classical
r0 = e2/mc2
or Thomson radius, the electromagnetic self-energy can
be adjusted to equal mc2. This is in accord with the
original idea of Lorentz and Abraham that the electron’s

rest mass is purely electromagnetic in origin. Because
of mutual repulsions among the electron’s elements of
charge, the whole structure might be expected to blow
itself apart. Poincar´e postulated the existence of non-
electromagnetic attractive forces—later called Poincar´e
stresses—to somehow counterbalance the Coulomb repul-
sion.

It was suggested in the 1930’s by Furry and Oppen-
heimer[2] that quantum-electrodynamic eﬀects could give
the vacuum some characteristics of a polarizable medium,
which Weisskopf[3] represented phenomenologically by
an inhomogeneous electric permittivity, viz.,

D(r) = ǫ(r)E(r)

Thus, assuming the electron’s rest mass is entirely elec-
tromagnetic,

The charge density analogous to (7) is determined by the
proportionality

ρ(r) =

so that the relation analogous to (8) implies a permittiv-
ity of the form

(14)

where k is a parameter with dimensions of length. For
example, a hypothetical electric dipole ppp with electro-
magnetic self-energy M c2 would imply

Assuming a spherically-symmetrical magnetic permeabil-
ity, we have

The original point charge is here exactly cancelled by a
deltafunction contribution from the polarization charge.
A functional form for ǫ(r) can be determined if the charge
density ρ(r) is assumed to be proportional to the electro-
magnetic energy density, so that

IV. CLASSICAL MODEL FOR THE ELECTRON

Let the electron be pictured as a structureless point
charge e with a magnetic dipole moment m = e~/2mc.
If the energy is entirely electromagnetic, according
to Lorentz-Abraham, the intrinsic angular momentum
should likewise be electromagnetic. In this way we can
sidestep any need to explain how a point particle can have
a spin angular momentum. (Alternatively, this might be

attributed to the motion of the polarization charge sur-
rounding the electron.) The angular momentum of an
electromagnetic ﬁeld is given by

the introduction of constitutive parameters for the elec-
tromagnetic vacuum, which actually has a physical ratio-
nale according to quantum ﬁeld theory. In any event, our
results reduce smoothly to conventional electrodynamics
for scales large compared to 10−13 cm. In particular, ǫ(r)
and µ(r) both rapidly approach their vacuum values of
1.

The Lorentz-Abraham conjecture, that the electron’s
rest mass of 0.511 MeV/c2 is entirely electromagnetic,
is made more plausible by the model we have described.
This is consistent as well with the (nearly, if not exactly)
zero rest mass of the electron’s uncharged weak isodou-
blet partner—the neutrino—which can be regarded as an
electron with zero charge. We note also that the neutron-
proton mass diﬀerence (1.29 MeV/c2) is of comparable
order of magnitude. The parameters which we have ﬁt
to the electron’s mass, angular momentum and magnetic
moment imply a g-factor of 2, consistent with Dirac’s
relativistic theory. (We have resisted the temptation to
adjust this to 2.0023, to account for QED radiative cor-
rections.)

Of course, the real physical electron must ultimately be
described by quantum mechanics or quantum ﬁeld the-
ory. Still, a fully consistent classical model can provide a
useful starting point[7]. And classical results do (usually)
represent ~
0 limits in quantum theory. Since it is by
no means settled that the current formalism of quantum
electrodynamics is the ﬁnal theory of the electron, it is
worthwhile to explore the classical limit that some suc-
cessor theory might also exhibit. Although the inﬁnities
associated with transverse radiation ﬁelds do remain, we
have succeeded in eliminating those of classical origin for
a point charge.

V. CONCLUSION

We have shown how to accommodate point struc-
tures with ﬁnite self-energies into classical electrodynam-
ics without altering the equations of Maxwell’s theory.
This is in contrast to earlier attempts of Born[5], Bopp[6]
and others, which involved nonlinear reformulations of
the fundamental equations. The key to our approach is

1 Problem

Some biological systems consist of two “phases” of nearly square ﬁber bundles of diﬀering
thermal and electrical conductivities. Consider a circular region of radius a near a corner of
such a system as shown below.

Phase 1, with electrical conductivity σ1, occupies the “bowtie” region of angle

α, while

phase 2, with conductivity σ2

σ1, occupies the remaining region.

≪

Deduce the approximate form of lines of current density j when a background electric
ﬁeld is applied along the symmetry axis of phase 1. What is the eﬀective conductivity σ of
the system, deﬁned by the relation I = σ∆φ between the total current I and the potential
diﬀerence ∆φ across the system?

It suﬃces to consider the case that the boundary arc (r = a,

potential φ = 1, while the arc (r = a, π
and no current ﬂows across the remainder of the boundary.

2 Solution

The series expansion approach is unsuccessful in treating the full problem of a “checkerboard”
array of two phases if those phases meet in sharp corners as shown above. However, an
analytic form for the electric potential of a two-phase (and also a four-phase) checkerboard
can be obtained using conformal mapping of certain elliptic functions [1]. If the regions of
one phase are completely surrounded by the other phase, rather lengthy series expansions

1

for the potential can be given [2]. The present problem is based on work by Grimvall [3] and
Keller [4].

In the steady state, the electric ﬁeld obeys

∇ ×
φ. The steady current density obeys

E = 0, so that E can be deduced from a
scalar potential φ via E =
j = 0, and is related
to the electric ﬁeld by Ohm’s law, j = σE. Hence, within regions of uniform conductivity,
2φ = 0. Thus, we seek solutions to Laplace’s equations in the four regions of
∇ ·
uniform conductivity, subject to the stated boundary conditions at the outer radius, as well
as the matching conditions that φ, Ek, and j⊥ are continuous at the boundaries between the
regions.

E = 0 and

We analyze this two-dimensional problem in a cylindrical coordinate system (r, θ) with
origin at the corner between the phases and θ = 0 along the radius vector that bisects the
region whose potential is unity at r = a. The four regions of uniform conductivity are labeled
I, II, III and IV as shown below.

Since j⊥ = jr = σEr =

σ∂φ/∂r at the outer boundary, the boundary conditions at

r = a can be written

Likewise, the condition that j⊥ = jθ = σEθ =
between the regions can be written

We recall that two-dimensional solutions to Laplace’s equations in cylindrical coordinates
involve sums of products of r±k and e±ikθ, where k is the separation constant that in general
can take on a sequence of values. Since the potential is zero at the origin, the radial function
is only rk. The symmetry condition (6) suggests that the angular functions for region I be
written as cos kθ, while the symmetry condition (7) suggests that we use sin k(π/2

The potential must be continuous at the boundaries between the regions, which requires

The normal component of the current density is also continuous across these boundaries, so
eq. (4) tells us that

On dividing eq. (12) by eq. (11) we ﬁnd that

There is an inﬁnite set of solutions to this transcendental equation. When σ2/σ1
1 we
expect that only the ﬁrst term in the expansions (8)-(9) will be important, and in this case
we expect that both kα and k(π/2

α) are small. Then eq. (13) can be approximated as

and hence

Equation (11) also tells us that for small kα,

For a square checkerboard, α = π/4, and the eﬀective conductivity is σ = √σ1σ2. It
turns out that this result is independent of the ratio σ2/σ1, and holds not only for the corner
region studied here but for the entire checkerboard array [5].

The (Mihelson) Sivashinsky equation of premixed (cid:29)ames is studied in a retangular domain in

two dimensions. A huge number of 2D stationary solutions are trivially obtained by addition of two

1D solutions. With Neumann boundary onditions, it is shown numerially that adding two stable

1D solutions leads to a 2D stable solution. This type of solution is shown to play an important role

in the dynamis of the equation with additive noise.

INTRODUCTION

The Sivashinsky equation [1℄ (or Mihelson Sivashinsky equation depending on the au-

thors) is a non linear equation whih desribes the time evolution of premixed (cid:29)ames. Be-

ause of the jump of temperature (and thus of density) aross the (cid:29)ame, a plane (cid:29)ame front

is submitted to a hydrodynami instability alled the Darrieus-Landau instability. The on-

servation of normal mass (cid:29)ux and tangential veloity aross the front leads to a de(cid:29)etion

of streamlines whih is the main ause of this instability. A more detailed desription of

this instability an be found in the book of Williams [2℄ (see also, in the approximation

of potential (cid:29)ow in the burnt gases, the elementary eletrostati explanation in [3℄, where

essentially the (cid:29)ame is desribed as a surfae with a uniform harge density). At small

sales, the instability is damped by di(cid:27)usive e(cid:27)ets: the loal front propagation veloity is

modi(cid:28)ed by a term proportional to urvature, the oe(cid:30)ient ahead of the urvature term

is alled the Markstein length. A geometrial non linear term, whih limits ultimately the

growth of the instability, is aused by the normal propagation of the (cid:29)ame. The Sivashinsky

equation, obtained as a development in powers of a gas expansion parameter, i.e. for a small

jump of temperature, or equivalently for a (cid:29)ow almost potential in the burnt gases, repre-

sents a balane between the evolution due to these three e(cid:27)ets, Darrieus Landau instability,

stabilization by urvature and normal propagation of the (cid:29)ame.

The qualitative agreement between the Sivashinsky equation and diret numerial simu-

lations, generally performed with periodi boundary onditions has been exellent even with

large gas expansion [4℄, and also when gravity is inluded [5℄. It has been shown in a lassi

paper of the (cid:28)eld [6℄ (following [7℄, where the pole deomposition was introdued) that the

1D solution of the Sivashinsky equation in the absene of noise was attrated for large times

toward stationary solutions, with poles aligned in the omplex plane, alled oalesent solu-

tions. It was shown analytially in [8℄[9℄ that eah solution, with a given number of poles,

is linearly stable in a given interval for the ontrol parameter (either the domain width or

more often the Markstein length with a domain width (cid:28)xed to 2π).

In a reent paper [10℄ (hereafter alled I) the present author has been interested in the

behavior of the Sivashinsky equation in 1D, but with Neumann boundary onditions (zero

slope at eah end of the domain), a situation whih, although more realisti than periodi

boundary onditions, had not attrated muh interest over the years. Atually, periodi

2

boundary onditions lead to a symmetry whih is not present in the ase of a (cid:29)ame in a

tube, i.e. every lateral translation of a given solution is also a solution. Presented in a

di(cid:27)erent way, a perturbation on the (cid:29)ame an grow, reah the usp (the very urved part

of the front, pointing toward the burnt gases) and then deay, but after having aused a

global translation of the original solution. This is not possible with Neumann boundary

onditions, but it was supposed that this di(cid:27)erene with periodi boundary onditions was

unimportant. The surprise was however that stable stationary solutions in the Neumann

ase involved a number of solutions with two usps (and the orresponding poles) at eah

end of the domain, alled bioalesent solutions. This type of solution of the Sivashinsky

equation was already introdued in [11℄, although this last artile did not obtain those whih

are stable with Neumann boundary onditions. The author would like to mention here two

artiles whih he did not ite in I , namely [12℄, where some bioalesent solutions with

Neumann boundary onditions were (cid:28)rst obtained, and [13℄ where bioalesent solutions

were obtained in diret numerial simulations.

In this last paper, one solution was not

ompletely stationary, beause of the e(cid:27)et of noise, but another solution was atually

almost stationary. Of ourse the omputer time needed for suh a simulation is probably

one hundred times more than the equivalent Sivashinsky equation simulation, with all sorts

of possible soures of noise, so obtaining really stationary bioalesent solutions in this ase

is a hallenging task.

Coming bak to I, we an summarize the 1D results of this paper in the following way:

1. Bioalesent solutions were obtained, stable with Neumann boundary onditions. Sim-

ulations performed without noise tend to these solutions.

2. The new solutions led to a bifuration diagram with a large number of stationary

solutions, where partiularly the number of solutions multiply when the Markstein

length, presented above, whih ontrols the stabilizing in(cid:29)uene of the urvature term,

dereases

3. The bioalesent solutions play a ma jor role in the dynamis of the equation with

additive noise.

In the ase of moderate white noise, the dynamis is ontrolled by

jumps between di(cid:27)erent bioalesent solutions.

In the present paper, we shall be interested in the Sivashinsky equation with Neumann

3

boundary onditions, but in two dimensions in a retangular domain. Another nie property

of the equation (apart from the pole deomposition in 1D) is that 2D solutions an be

formed by the simple addition of two 1D solutions, one for eah oordinate [14℄. The exat

ounterpart of I will be obtained:

1. Sums of two bioalesent solutions are stable in 2D with Neumann boundary ondi-

tions. The time evolution of the equation without noise tends toward these solutions

2. With sums of a large number of 1D solutions, a really huge number of 2D solutions

an be obtained.

3. The sums of bioalesent solutions play also a ma jor role in the dynamis in two

dimensions in the presene of noise.

II. SOLUTIONS IN ELONGATED DOMAINS

The Sivashinsky equation in one dimension an be written as

φt +

φ2
x = νφxx + I (φ)

1
2

where φ (x) is the vertial position of the front. The Landau operator I (φ) orresponds

to a multipliation by |k| in Fourier spae, where k is the wavevetor, and physially to the

destabilizing in(cid:29)uene of gas expansion on the (cid:29)ame front (known as the Darrieus-Landau

instability, and desribed in the introdution). ν is the only parameter of the equation (the

Markstein length) and ontrols the stabilizing in(cid:29)uene of urvature. The linear dispersion

relation giving the growth rate σ versus the wavevetor is, inluding the two e(cid:27)ets:

(1)

(2)

As usual with Sivashinsky-type equations, the only non linear term added to the equa-

1

2 φ2

q

tion is

x . In the (cid:29)ame front ase, this term is purely geometrial : the (cid:29)ame propagates

in the diretion of its normal, a pro jetion on the vertial (y ) diretion gives the fator

cos (θ) = 1/

1 + φ2

x , where θ is the angle between the normal and the vertial diretion,

then a development valid for small slopes of the front leads to the term

equation is typially solved numerially on [0, 2π] with periodi boundary onditions. In I

1

2φ2

x . The Sivashinsky

σ = |k| − νk

2

4

it has also been solved on [0, 2π] with only symmetri modes, whih orresponds to homo-

geneous Neumann boundary onditions on [0, π] (zero slope on both ends of the domain).

The two dimensional version of the Sivashinsky equation is

φt +

2
(∇φ)

= ν∆φ + I (φ)

1
2

where the Landau operator I (φ) orresponds now to a multipliation by

Fourier spae, kx and ky being the wavevetors in the x and y diretions. All dynamial

(3)

x + k2
k2

y in

q

alulations, are performed by Fourier pseudo-spetral methods (i.e. the non linear term is

alulated in physial spae and not by a onvolution produt in Fourier spae). The method

used is (cid:28)rst order in time and semi-impliit (impliit on the linear terms of the equation,

1

2φ2

expliit on

x). No partiular treatment of aliasing errors is used. The 2D Sivashinsky

equation is solved in [0, 2π] ∗ [0, 2b] with only symmetri modes, whih orresponds to ho-

mogeneous Neumann boundary onditions in the retangular domain [0, π] ∗ [0, b] .

Pole solutions ([6℄) of the 1D Sivashinsky equation are solutions of the form:

φ = 2ν

N

n=1 (
X

ln

sin

 

 

x − zn(t)
2

+ ln

sin

!!

 

 

n(t)

x − z∗
2

!!)

(4)

where N is the number of poles zn(t) in the omplex plane. Atually the poles appear in

omplex onjugate pairs, and the asterisk in Equation 4 denotes the omplex onjugate. In

all the paper, the number of poles will also mean number of poles with a positive imaginary

part. The pole deomposition transforms the solution of the Sivashinsky equation into the

solution of a dynamial system for the loations of the poles.

In the ase of stationary

solutions, the loations of the poles are obtained by solving a non linear system:

2N

− ν

Xl=1,l6=n

cot

zn − zl
2

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

− isgn [Im (zn)] = 0

n = 1, · · · , N

(5)

where Im (zn) denotes the imaginary part and sgn is the signum funtion. This non linear

system is solved by a variant of Newton method.

With periodi boundary ondition, the usual result is that in the window 2n − 1≤ 1/ν≤

2n+ 1, n = 1, 2, · · · there exists n di(cid:27)erent monooalesent stationary solutions (all the poles

have the same real part), with 1 to n poles, and the solution with the maximum number of

poles n is asymptotially stable. For a partiular value of 1/ν , the number n(ν) suh that

2n − 1≤ 1/ν≤ 2n + 1 is alled the optimal number of poles.

5

With Neumann boundary onditions, in eah of the intervals [2n − 1, 2n + 1] of the pa-

rameter 1/ν , not only one asymptotially stable solution, but n + 1, of the form (l, n − l)

with l = 0, 1,· · · , n where l poles oalese at x = 0 and l −n oalese at x = π , were obtained

in I. (The bioalesent type of solutions have been reently introdued in [11℄). In Figure 1

is shown a bifuration diagram with all the possible stable stationary solutions (plotted only,

ontrary to I, in the domain where they are stable) versus 1/ν . What is atually plotted is

the amplitude ∆φ (maximum minus minimum of φ) versus 1/ν. As an be seen, when the

optimal number of poles inreases with 1/ν , the number of stable stationary bioalesent

solutions is also inreasing. The stability of these solutions is not proved analytially, nor

by a numerial study of the linearized problem, we use only numerial simulations of the

Sivashinsky equation, with the di(cid:27)erent bioalesent solutions plus some small perturbations

as initial onditions, and the solution returns toward the unperturbed solution.

In a square domain [0, 2π] ∗ [0, 2π], it has been remarked in [14℄ that if φ1(x) and φ2(x)

are solutions of the 1D Sivashinsky equation (1), then φ1(x) + φ2(y) (we use here φ1 ⊕ φ2

as a notation for this sum, whose amplitude is the sum of the amplitudes of φ1 and φ2) is

a solution of (3) in two dimensions, and that the stationary solution obtained numerially

in this ase for periodi boundary onditions [15℄ is simply a sum of two monooalesent

1D solutions. Let us note that, if it is absolutely obvious that sums are solutions of the 2D

equation, the stability of these solutions has never been proved analytially, and an only

be inferred from a small number of numerial simulations.

In the ase of retangular domains [0, 2π] ∗ [0, 2b], sums are also solutions of the equation,

with φ2 now solution of the 1D Sivashinsky equation with parameter 1/ν in domain [0, 2b],

whih an be obtained by an appropriate resaling from the solution in [0, 2π] with parameter

1/ν1 = (1/ν)(b/π).

A partiularly simple ase is the limit where b is very small, where the only solution with

parameter 1/ν in domain [0, 2b] is simply the (cid:29)at (0) solution φ2 = 0. As a sum of the

previously desribed bioalesent solutions in [0, 2π] added to the (cid:29)at solution in the other

diretion, we have simply a way to observe the bioalesent solutions in two dimensions. We

have observed numerially (not shown here, the behavior is very similar to the 1D ase) for

Neumann boundary onditions, that these sums (l, n − l) ⊕ (0) are stable . As an example,

for 1/ν = 10 and b = π/10 we show in Figure 2 a perspetive view of the three di(cid:27)erent

stationary bioalesent solutions (5, 0) ⊕ (0), (4, 1) ⊕ (0), (3, 2) ⊕ (0) (from top to bottom).

6

In all the (cid:28)gures, the whole domain [0, 2π] ∗ [0, 2b] is plotted, the solution with Neumann

boundary onditions orresponds only to one fourth of the domain [0, π] ∗ [0, b] . We have

found it learer to show the whole domain (ontrary to I), beause some solutions are very

di(cid:30)ult to distinguish if plotted in [0, π] ∗ [0, b]. Although these solutions are very sensitive

to noise (although less than the pure 1D solutions) it ould be possible to observe in diret

numerial simulations and experimentally the solutions with the lower amplitude, whih are

the least sensitive to noise.

In experiments, the solutions should also survive heat losses

(important in narrow hannels) and not be too muh perturbed by gravity (i.e. have a large

enough Froude number) in order to be observed .

III. SOLUTIONS IN SQUARE DOMAINS

We now turn to stationary solutions in square domains [0, 2π] ∗ [0, 2π] with Neumann

boundary onditions. Sums of bioalesent solutions produe also in this ase stable sta-

tionary solutions. The purpose of this setion is to give details on the onsequenes of this

simple addition property. We show (cid:28)rst the di(cid:27)erent types of solutions obtained by addition

of stable bioalesent solutions in 1D. We insist on the fat that these solutions are linearly

stable and give a spei(cid:28) example of the time evolution of one suh solution with some small

perturbations. Finally two bifuration diagrams are provided, one is the 2D equivalent of

Figure 1 with the stable solutions plotted only in their stable domain. The seond ontains

all the solutions obtained by addition of all the branhes found in 1D in I, and as the reader

will see, a really huge number of branhes are reated in this way.

In Figures 3 and 4 are shown the six stable solutions obtained from the three 1D solutions

of Figure 2 for 1/ν = 10. In Figure 3 an be seen (in perspetive view, for the whole domain

[0, 2π]∗[0, 2π]), from top to bottom the (5, 0)⊕(5, 0), (4, 1)⊕(5, 0)and (3, 2)⊕(5, 0) solutions.

In Figure 4 an be seen the three remaining solutions (4, 1) ⊕ (4, 1), (3, 2) ⊕ (4, 1) and

(3, 2) ⊕ (3, 2). All these solutions are found to be linearly stable, although all the solutions

of Figure 3 ((5, 0)⊕ something) are extremely sensitive to noise. It must be pointed out that

most of these solutions would have been almost impossible to (cid:28)nd from a time integration

of the 2D Sivashinsky equation (Equation (3)) beause of this sensitivity to noise, and it is

likely that obtaining them from a steady version of (3) would have been very di(cid:30)ult too.

In Figure 5, we have an example showing the stability of the (3, 2) ⊕ (4, 1) solution. We

7

start from this solution and add an additive white noise to Equation (3) when the time is

below 0.5. This white noise is gaussian, of deviation one, and we multiply it by an amplitude

a = 0.001. It an be seen that after the noise is stopped, the solution tends exponentially

bak toward the (3, 2) ⊕ (4, 1) solution. Similar (cid:28)gures would be obtained with the other

solutions of Figures 3 and 4, exept that higher amplitude solutions would need an even

lower noise in order not to jump immediately toward a lower amplitude solution.

In Figure 6 is shown the strit 2D equivalent of Figure 1: the bifuration diagram showing

the amplitude versus 1/ν for all the solutions whih are linearly stable, only plotted in their

domain of stability. For 1/ν < 3 there is only one possibility (1, 0) ⊕ (1, 0). For 3 < 1/ν < 5

we have three branhes (from higher to lower amplitudes) (2, 0) ⊕ (2, 0) (1, 1) ⊕ (2, 0) and

(1, 1) ⊕ (1, 1). For the value 1/ν = 10 we have the six solutions of Figures 3 and 4, that is

from higher to lower amplitudes the (5, 0) ⊕ (5, 0), (4, 1) ⊕ (5, 0) (3, 2) ⊕ (5, 0) (4, 1) ⊕ (4, 1),

(3, 2) ⊕ (4, 1) and (3, 2) ⊕ (3, 2) solutions. Higher values of 1/ν would orrespond to an

inreasing number of stable stationary solutions.

Naturally, neither Figure 1 (in 1D) or Figure 6 (in 2D) ontain all the possible stationary

solutions.

In 1D Guidi and Marhetti [11℄ have introdued the onept of interpolating

solutions, whih are unstable solutions onneting di(cid:27)erent branhes of stable solutions in

the previous bifuration diagrams. In I, the present author has shown that this leads to a

omplex network of solutions, whih was alled web of stationary solutions. But now in two

dimensions, we have the possibility, when two branhes φ1 and φ2 exist for a parameter 1/ν

to reate the 2D branh φ1 ⊕ φ2 . This onstrution leads to a bifuration diagram (with as

before 1/ν < 14, i.e. not very large (cid:29)ames) with a truly huge number of di(cid:27)erent stationary

solutions (several thousands of branhes). The omparison with Figure 6 shows that most

of these solutions are linearly unstable.

The author would like to insist here on di(cid:27)erent points. First, it is only possible to obtain

suh an inredible number of stationary solutions beause of two properties of the Sivashinsky

equation, the pole deomposition, whih transforms the searh of stationary solutions in one

dimension in a 0D problem, then the possibility to add 1D solutions in order to get 2D

retangular solutions of the Sivashinsky equation. In the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation

ase (a non linear equation with a di(cid:27)erent growth rate but the same non linear term)

the pole deomposition is not available, but nevertheless a lot of 1D stationary solutions

have been obtained [16℄. The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation shares with the Sivashinsky

8

equation the possibility to reate 2D solutions by adding two 1D solutions, so atually in this

ase we have also a very large number of branhes. These retangular solutions are not as

physially relevant in the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation ase. Contrary to the Sivashinsky

equation, where stable stationary solutions are basially as large as possible and are thus

retangular in a retangular domain, it seems likely that in the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky ase,

the most interesting solutions would have an hexagonal symmetry (hexagonal ells are also

observed for the Sivashinsky equation with stabilizing gravity [17℄). Stationary solutions

of the Sivashinsky equation with hexagonal symmetry should exist too, and the author

onjetures that the order of magnitude of the number of solutions with hexagonal symmetry

should be approximately the same as those with retangular symmetry. Apparently there

is no trivial way to onstrut hexagonal solutions, so unfortunately, until some progress is

made, obtaining the hexagonal equivalent of Figure 7 is almost impossible. We have here

an example emphasizing the fat that as the smoothing e(cid:27)et (visosity, urvature, surfae

tension ...) dereases, we are not able to generate orretly all the simple solutions of a

given set of partial di(cid:27)erential equations (Sivashinsky and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations,

Navier Stokes ...) even with the aid of omputers.

IV. EVOLUTION WITH NOISE

In the previous setion we have shown numerially that the sums of linearly stable 1D

bioalesent solutions lead to linearly stable 2D solutions. However, even a linearly stable

solution ould have a very small basin of attration. So in this setion, we study the e(cid:27)et

of noise on the solutions of the Sivashinsky equation in a square domain, with Neumann

boundary onditions. The important solutions will be the solutions that are reasonably

resistant to the applied noise.

This noise used here is simply an additive noise, added to the right-hand side of Equation

(3). We hoose the simplest possible noise, a white noise (in spae and time), whih is

gaussian, has deviation one and is multiplied by an amplitude a. But ontrary to Figure

5, this noise will be applied at eah time step. We use in all the simulations presented the

same parameter 1/ν = 10, the stationary solutions orresponding to this parameter have

been presented in the previous setion. We reall that in I, for the one dimensional version

of the Sivashinsky equation with moderate noise, the evolution was analysed in terms of

9

jumps between the available bioalesent stationary solutions. We would like to show here

that in 2D, the sums of bioalesent solutions also play an important role in the dynamis.

In Figure 8, starting from an initial ondition whih is the (4, 1)⊕(4, 1) stationary solution,

is plotted the amplitude of the solution versus time, for a noise amplitude a = 0.01, with also

straight lines orresponding to the amplitudes of the lowest amplitude stationary solutions,

i.e. those of Figure 4. The stationary solutions with higher amplitudes (those of Figure 3)

apparently are too sensitive to noise to play any role in the dynamis. It is seen in Figure

8 that beause of the noise, the solution departs quikly from the (4, 1) ⊕ (4, 1) solution,

and that it seems that, during the time evolution, the solution is lose (apart from some

violent peaks in the amplitude) to the (3, 2) ⊕ (4, 1) solution for some time, then (cid:28)nally the

amplitude dereases again to be near that of the (3, 2) ⊕ (3, 2) solution.

In order to prove that the solution is indeed lose to the previously mentioned solutions,

beause after all very di(cid:27)erent solutions ould have similar amplitudes, we plot in Figure 9

for the same simulation, what we have alled the distane between the solution at a given

time and the sums of bioalesent solutions, whih is simply the L1 norm of the di(cid:27)erene

between both solutions. The spatial mean value of all solutions is adjusted here to have

the same value. Normally, it is neessary to measure the distane between the solution and

all symmetries of a given sum of bioalesent solutions (i.e. you an interhange the poles

at 0 and π in the x and y diretions) but for the low amplitude a = 0.01, it has not been

neessary, and we plot only the distane from the relevant solutions.

As we start from the (4, 1) ⊕ (4, 1) solution, the distane to this solution is zero initially,

and we an see that, although the amplitude seems to indiate that at some time, one is again

lose to this solution, this is not the ase. On the ontrary, the solution returns regularly

lose to the (3, 2) ⊕ (4, 1) solution for times lower than 110, then there is a transition toward

something lose to the (3, 2) ⊕ (3, 2) solution, the solution departs slightly from this last

solution for some time, possibly toward a linearly unstable stationary solution, and returns

toward it at the end of the simulation. As Figure 6 remotely looks like energy levels in

atomi physis, one ould be tempted to interpret the evolution of the two previous (cid:28)gures

with a small noise (apparently in 2D the solution is less sensitive to a given amplitude of the

white noise ompared to 1D simulations) as a sort of desexitation from the high amplitude

level (4, 1)⊕(4, 1) toward (cid:28)rst (3, 2)⊕(4, 1), then toward the fundamental level (3, 2)⊕(3, 2).

Indeed, between the sums of bioalesent solutions, if all are linearly stable, the solutions

10

with the lower amplitude seems to be more resistant to the ation of noise.

To better understand the e(cid:27)et of noise, we present now a simulation with a larger

noise amplitude a = 0.1 , ten times larger than the previous ase (we reall that this noise

amplitude should be ompared to the laminar (cid:29)ame veloity, whih is normalized to 1 in

this paper). In Figure 10 is plotted the amplitude versus time, with as before straight lines

with the amplitude of the important sums of bioalesent solutions. The initial ondition is

also the (4, 1) ⊕ (4, 1) solution. Apparently this last solution is too sensitive to noise to play

a meaningful role in the dynamis, although it happens that some peaks in the amplitude

ould involve solutions not too far from this initial solution. As the distane to this solution

is never really small, even in the peaks, we shall not omment further on this solution. On

the other hand, it seems that a lot of time is spent with an amplitude lose to that of the

(3, 2) ⊕ (3, 2) solution (whih we have alled previously the fundamental level), and perhaps

some time with an amplitude lose to the (3, 2) ⊕ (4, 1) solution (the (cid:28)rst exited level).

In order to see what is really ourring, we now turn to (cid:28)gures of the distane (de(cid:28)ned

above) to these two solutions versus time (for the same simulation of Figure 10). However,

for a higher amplitude, we have to inlude the four di(cid:27)erent symmetries of these solutions

in the analysis (i.e.

for instane (3, 2) ⊕ (4, 1) (3, 2) ⊕ (1, 4) (2, 3) ⊕ (4, 1) (2, 3) ⊕ (1, 4) )

. In Figure 11 is shown the distane to the four symmetries of the (3, 2) ⊕ (3, 2) solution.

The distane to one of the four symmetries is indeed often small (but not very small for this

value of the noise) during the time evolution. Then beause of the noise, perturbations are

reated that lead the amplitude to inrease as the perturbation is onveted toward one of

the usps, and the solution often omes bak toward another symmetry of the fundamental

level.

In Figure 12 is shown the distane to the four symmetries of the (3, 2) ⊕ (4, 1) solution

(the (cid:28)rst exited level) (always for the same simulation).

It is seen that the solution is

only reasonably lose to this type of solution at times lose to 50. At other times, minima

of the distane are not very small and the solution is often loser to the (3, 2) ⊕ (3, 2)

solution.

In I, we have presented the evolution of the 1D Sivashinsky equation with a

moderate additive noise as a series of jumps between bioalesent solutions.

In 2D the

situation is relatively similar, with the sums of bioalesent solutions playing the same

role. However, the noise amplitude neessary to ause jumps seems muh higher in 2D, and

pratially speaking during the previous simulation, only the fundamental (the solution with

11

the lowest amplitude) and (cid:28)rst exited levels were obtained. It should also be noted that the

degeneresene (the four possible symmetries) of the fundamental level is probably important

in the evolution (for instane for 1/ν = 12 the fundamental level would be (3, 3) ⊕ (3, 3),

whih does not lead to other solutions by symmetry, so that it should be less likely to obtain

the fundamental level in this ase).

Before losing this setion, let us insist on the fat that, if the solution regularly returns

toward sums of bioalesent solutions, the fronts we obtain are not sums for eah time. Figure

13, where is plotted a front of the previous simulation for time 120.1 (just before a peak of

the amplitude in Figure 10) , should be a lear example of this property. In this Figure,

the whole domain [0, 2π] ∗ [0, 2π] is plotted as before, but this time as a graysale (cid:28)gure,

white orresponding to the minimum of φ, blak to the maximum. Essentially, an oblique

perturbation has grown on a front that was previously a sum. This oblique perturbation

moves toward eah orner of Figure 13, and the amplitude peak orresponds to the moment

where the perturbation reahes the orner. Then the solution is attrated again toward a

sum of bioalesent solutions.

To summarize this setion on the e(cid:27)et of noise, the fat that all the sums of bioalesent

solutions with the optimal number of poles are linearly stable does not prove that they an

be pratially observed. On the ontrary, the solutions with the larger amplitude have a

basin of attration so small that they an almost never be seen. We have introdued an

analogy with atomi physis by alling the bioalesent solution with the lowest amplitude

the fundamental level, other solutions the exited levels. In the examples shown, only the

fundamental and (cid:28)rst exited levels (and their symmetries) were obtained during the time

evolution of the Sivashinsky equation exited by an additive noise. We reall that in I, it was

shown in 1D that the evolution with noise was ompletely di(cid:27)erent with periodi boundary

onditions, where only the largest amplitude monooalesent solution was linearly stable

(even if extremely sensitive to noise).

In this ase, the solution regularly returns lose

to the highest amplitude solution. With Neumann boundary onditions, this is just the

opposite, the solution prefers to be lose to the lowest amplitude, almost symmetri, sum of

bioalesent solutions.

V. CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have used the possibility to reate two dimensional retangular sta-

tionary solutions from the addition of two 1D stationary solutions in order to generate a

huge number of stationary solutions of the Sivashinsky equation. With Neumann boundary

onditions, the addition of two stable 1D bioalesent solutions leads to stable 2D solutions,

whih also play a role in the dynamis when an additive noise is added to the equation. How-

ever, with noise, only the sums of bioalesent solutions with the lowest amplitude (whih

are less sensitive to noise) have a reasonable hane to be observed. More preisely, jumps

between di(cid:27)erent symmetries of the lowest amplitude sum, or between the two sums with

the lower amplitude, are obtained in the simulations. Although we have used a white noise

in this paper, experiments, submitted to a residual turbulene, should behave in a similar

way. In order to have a large enough Froude number for gravity e(cid:27)ets to be negligible,

(cid:29)ames with a su(cid:30)iently large laminar (cid:29)ame veloity would have to be hosen.

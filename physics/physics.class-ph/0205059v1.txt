Abstract
In a previous paper (physics/0203061) ”Floating bodies of equi-
librium” we have shown that there exist two-dimensional non-circular cross-
sections of bodies of homogeous density ρ
= 1/2 which can ﬂoat in any orien-
tation in water, which have a p-fold rotation axis. For given p they exist for
p
2 diﬀerent densities. However, this was found only in a Taylor-expansion in
a parameter which described the distortion from the circular shape up to sev-
enth order. Here a diﬀerential equation for the boundary curve is given and the
non-circular boundary curve can be expressed in terms of an elliptic integral.

Introduction

Stanislaw Ulam asks in the Scottish Book [1] (problem 19), whether a sphere is
the only solid of uniform density which will ﬂoat in water in any position. In a
recent paper[2] I considered the two-dimensional problem for ρ
= 1/2. (The case
ρ = 1/2 has been solved by Auerbach [3]). I was able to obtain non-circular
two-dimensional cross-sections of bodies which can ﬂow in any orientation in
water by a perturbative expansion around the circular solution. These cross-
sections have a p-fold rotation symmetry.
In polar coordinates r and ψ the
boundary-curve could be expanded in powers of a deformation-parameter ǫ

r(ψ) = ¯r(1 + 2ǫ cos(pψ) + 2

cn(ǫ) cos(npψ)).

(1)

The coeﬃcients cn = O(ǫn) were determined up to order ǫ7. Although one has
solutions for p
2 diﬀerent densities ρ, it turned out that r(ψ) was the same for
all these densities.

Here a non-perturbative solution is given. It is shown that the boundary-

curve obeys the diﬀerential equation

and is thus given by an elliptic integral. With increasing ψ the radius r oscillates

periodically between the largest and the smallest radii r> and r<, resp. The
three constants a, b, and c are determined by these extreme radii, and by the
periodicity of the boundary. Since r′ vanishes for the extrema of r, one has

The solution of the diﬀerential equation (2) expanded in powers of ǫ agrees
completely with the expansion obtained in [2]. (Actually a factor 3 is missing
in the ǫ5 cos(3ψ) term in eq. 86).

p

I explain now, how I arrived at this diﬀerential equation. Denote the two
intersections of the water-line with the cross-section by L and R. From the
general arguments given in [2] one knows, that the length 2l of the water-
line has to be independent of the orientation. (Here actually we will ﬁx the
orientation of the cross-section and rotate the water-line including the direction
of the gravitational force.) The midpoint M of the line moves in the direction
of the chord LR as the water-line is rotated. Suppose the coordinates of the
intersections are given by L = (xM −
If the
l + dxL, yM + dyL), R′ =
line moves by an inﬁnitesimal amount L′ = (xM −
(xM + l + dxR, yM + dyR), then the condition, that the distance L′R′ = 2l is
ﬁxed yields dxL = dxR and the condition, that M moves in the direction of LR
yields dyL + dyR = 0. From both conditions we ﬁnd, that under this change the
dx2
R disappears on
same length of the perimeter du =
one side below the water-line and appears on the other side above the water-line.
Then dxL = dxR = cos βdu, dyL =
dyR = sin βdu. Thus the angles between
the tangents on the boundary and the water-line are the same on both ends.

Figure 1: Boundary curve, water-line LR, tangents, and the angles β.

In the following we will use these properties in two forms:

(i) as line-
condition, requiring, that the envelope of the water-lines is the loci of the mid-
points M , so that we obtain L and R by drawing tangents on the envelope and

2

going a constant distance l along the tangent in both directions to obtain L and
R. (ii) as angle-condition, requiring, that moving L and R the same piece u
along the perimeter to L′ and R′, the angles βL and βR between the tangents
and the chord L′R′ always obey βL = βR. Both conditions are equivalent. From
(i) follows (ii) and from (ii) follows (i).

In a next step consider the limit of large p. Then r will oscillate on a distance
of order ¯r/p, which is small in comparison to ¯r itself. I assume, that then one can
neglect the overall average curvature 1/¯r and one may ﬁnd a periodic function
f of ξ = ¯rψ, which obeys the line-condition. Indeed assuming, that this holds
for l
¯r/p, that is on a distance of many periods, one can derive in this linear
case a diﬀerential equation, which has to be obeyed by the function f . This will
be done in subsection 2.1. Expanding the solution in powers of ǫ is in agreement
with the terms leading in 1/p which were found in eq. 86 of [2].

≫

Unfortunately this procedure is not applicable for ﬁnite p. Here I work with
a new conjecture: Although for physical reasons the periodicity p has to be an
integer, one may try it with non-integer p. If p diﬀers from an integer inﬁnitesi-
mally, then going around by the angle 2π one arrives at the same function shifted
however, in ψ-direction by an inﬁnitesimal angle 2α. I conjecture that there is
also a line between L and R belonging to angles ψL,R diﬀering by δψ
2π of
constant small length 2l, which obeys the line-condition. This condition yields
a diﬀerential equation. For the linear case this is done in subsection 2.2. It is
in agreement with that derived for large distance l. For the circular case one
obtains the diﬀerential equation in subsection 3.1, which is identical to eq. (2).
Finally it is shown in subsections 2.3 and 3.2, that the angle-condition holds
for the curves described by the so obtained diﬀerential equations which are
shifted by arbitrary distances in the linear case and by arbitrary angles in the
circular case, resp. This last property can now also be used for two points L
and R on the same curve, and thus shows that eq. (2) yields the boundaries for
cross-sections with ρ

= 1/2.

≈

The derivation for the linear approximation is given, since it is somewhat
simpler, but one may skip section 2 and go directly to the derivation in section
3.

2 Linear Approximation

Consider now the above mentioned linear case. Let us start from the loci of the
middle points M of the chord LR, described by Cartesian coordinates (g, ξ).
Then drawing the tangent on this curve and moving along the tangent by the
distance l in both directions one obtains the points R and L, which should lie
on the same curve described by f (ξ). Thus the functions g and f should obey

Comparison with the equation obtained for large distances (17) shows agree-
ment, if we change the notation for the constants. There is no linear term in
eq.(17) like the term 3c1f in eq.(24). The reason is, that in eq. (17) we required
f to vanish on the average. But of course a constant can be added to f and g,
yielding such a linear term. Thus both procedures yield the same diﬀerential
equation.

2.3 Arbitrary Distance

We show now the following theorem. Consider two curves CL and CR which
are governed by eq. (17) with the same constants a and b, and point L
CL
with Cartesian coordinates ξL, fL and R
CR with coordinates ξR, fR. If now
the angle βL between the tangent in L and LR equals the angle βR between the
tangent in R and RL, and fL 6
= fR, then this property will hold between any
two points L′
CR, which are obtained by moving from L and R
∈
by the same arc u in the same direction along the curves. Simultaneously the
distance L′R′ = LR is constant.

For rL = rR one has γL = γR and φL =

3.3 Application to the boundary

We may now apply the theorem to our original problem. In this problem the
two curves are identical and constitute the boundary. Suppose we have now
a curve obeying the diﬀerential equation (2) with integer p. Then we have to
look for points L, R on this curve which have either the properties n = 0 and
= rR or otherwise the properties rL = rR and ˙n = 0, eq. (68). We will now

show, that there are at least p
For this purpose we divide the curve into pieces A1, ... Ap in which r decreases
from r> to r< as ψ increases and into pieces B1, ... Bp, where r increases from
r< to r>. We now look for solutions rL = rR and ˙n = 0, where rR is in A1 and
rL in Bk. Thus we have to ﬁnd a solution of (68). We realize, that with the
exception of l = 0 the ﬁrst term in (68) vanishes for r = r> and r = r<, since
WL = 0, because r′ = 0 at these extrema.

Thus 1 + a(r + r>)(r + r<)(r> + r<) > 0, and therefor the factors (1 + 2ar>(r> +
r<)2) and (1 + 2ar<(r> + r<)2) in the expressions for c0 are positive. Therefore
one has c0(r>) < 0 and c0(r<) > 0. Therefore ˙n changes sign between r = r>
and r = r<. Since ˙n is a continuous function of rL, there must be a zero in
between. This argument holds for all pieces Bk with the exception of those
adjacent to A1. (For those adjacent l may become 0. In this limit one ﬁnds ˙n =
0.) Therefore we have at least p
2 solutions, which is in agreement with those
found in [2]. We leave aside the question, whether for suﬃciently large ratios
r>/r< more solutions appear and whether there are other solutions for ρ
= 1/2.
We ﬁnally mention that in the near-circular case (r> −
1 the
periodicity p is related to a by p2 = 1 + 8ar3, where r is some intermediate
radius.

4 Conclusion

We have given a closed representation of the boundaries of logs ﬂoating in any
= 1/2 in terms of a diﬀerential equation which can be solved
direction with ρ
by an elliptic integral. The diﬀerential equation could be obtained, since points
of two of these curves rotated against each other can be connected by chords so
that by progressing on the two curves by the same length of the perimeter the
length of the chord does not change. Using that this holds also for two curves
rotated against each other by an inﬁnitesimal angle connected by a chord of
inﬁnitesimal length the diﬀerential equation could be derived. The diﬀerential
equation of the linear analogue of this curve has also been given.

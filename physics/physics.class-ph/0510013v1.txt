Abstract

Close insight into mathematical and conceptual structure of classical ﬁeld theo-
ries shows serious inconsistencies in their common basis. In other words, we claim
in this work to have come across two severe mathematical blunders in the very foun-
dations of theoretical hydrodynamics. One of the defects concerns the traditional
treatment of time derivatives in Eulerian hydrodynamic description. The other
one resides in the conventional demonstration of the so-called Convection Theorem.
Both approaches are thought to be necessary for cross-veriﬁcation of the standard
diﬀerential form of continuity equation. Any revision of these fundamental results
might have important implications for all classical ﬁeld theories. Rigorous reconsid-
eration of time derivatives in Eulerian description shows that it evokes Minkowski
metric for any ﬂow ﬁeld domain without any previous postulation. Mathematical ap-
proach is developed within the framework of congruences for general 4-dimensional
diﬀerentiable manifold and the ﬁnal result is formulated in form of a theorem. A
modiﬁed version of the Convection Theorem provides a necessary cross-veriﬁcation
for a reconsidered diﬀerential form of continuity equation. Although the approach
is developed for one-component (scalar) ﬂow ﬁeld, it can be easily generalized to
any tensor ﬁeld. Some possible implications for classical electrodynamics are also
explored.

1 Introduction

Key words: ﬁnal Cauchy problem, continuity equation, convection theorem, ﬂuid

This work treats some aspects of conceptual, logical and mathematical structure of
classical ﬁeld theories. Put in other terms, we claim here to have stumbled upon two
severe mathematical blunders in the very foundations of theoretical hydrodynamics as a
corner-stone of all classical ﬁeld theories. More close insight shows that there are some
diﬃculties in the conventional approach to time derivatives. First indications of them
could already be found in Euler’s seminal work ”General Principles of the Motion of
Fluids” (1755)[1] whereas the other appeared in the 19th century in the demonstration of
the so-called Convection Theorem. The question about whether there are some reasons
these defects resisted to be seen up till now deserves special considerations elsewhere.

However, we shall make some comments in this respect in our attempt to clarify the
situation.

In modern retrospective we are aware of a certain unevenness in progressive devel-

opment of mathematics implying by it[2]

...false proofs, slips in reasoning, and inadvertent mistakes which with
more care could have been avoided. Such blunders there were aplenty. The
illogical development also involved inadequate understanding of concepts, a
failure to recognize all the principles of logic required, and an inadequate rigor
of proof; that is, intuition, physical arguments, and appeal to geometrical
diagrams had taken the place of logical arguments...

In the ﬁrst place, this uneasy state of aﬀairs concerned mainly the calculus, laid
down by 16th and 17th-centuries scholars. However, the heroic extension of the subject
by 18th-century mathematicians (sometimes the 18th century is called the heroic age
in mathematics) to entirely new branches (ordinary and partial diﬀerential equations,
the calculus of variations, diﬀerential geometry etc) did not imply a special eﬀort in
clariﬁcation of basic concepts and logical justiﬁcation of operations, frequently used in
the calculus. The problem of rigorization of the subject remained open. According to
the Morris Kline authorized opinion[2]

... the 18th century ended with the logic of the calculus and of the branches
In fact, one
of analysis built on the calculus in a totally confused state.
could say that the state of the foundations was worse in 1800 than in 1700.
Giants, notably Euler and Lagrange, had given incorrect logical foundations.
Because these men were authorities, many of their colleagues accepted and
repeated uncritically what they proposed and even built more analysis on their
foundations...

Even fundamental concepts of calculus proper such as a continuous function and
the derivative of a function were, to some extent, intuitive notions well into the 19th
century. By 1800 and early in the 19th century, among mathematicians (Bolzano, Abel,
Cauchy etc) certain concern was growing about what was correct, inadequacies and
contradictions in existing proofs, confusions and vagueness in deﬁnitions etc. Cauchy,
who started clariﬁcation of foundations in the second decade of the 19th century and
exerted the most inﬂuence in rigorization of the calculus, decided to build his approach
on D’Alembert’s limit concept. Notably, they were Bolzano and Cauchy who gave a
modern deﬁnition of the derivative[3], i.e. they deﬁned the derivative as a limit, avoiding
a purely formalistic approach adopted earlier by Euler and Lagrange. Cauchy’s work
was followed by many mathematicians and by Weierstrass, the most inﬂuent authority
among them, who removed all dependence on intuitive notions and by 1900 completed
the rigorization of the fundamentals of analysis.

At any rate, the requirement of rigor was also applicable to all branches of applied
mathematics and mathematical physics. Theoretical hydrodynamics was no exception,

2

although some aspects of speciﬁc empirical knowledge resisted to be molded into ade-
quate mathematical abstractions and remained on a level of half-intuitive concepts for
a longer period. It especially concerns the notion of a ﬂuid quantity which found sound
mathematical clariﬁcation only at the end of the 19th century in works on geometrical
transformations (Klein, Lie etc). It is also worth reminding that the study of functions,
diﬀerential equations, basic notions of diﬀerential geometry relevant to some extent in
the framework of the theory of ﬂuids and elasticity was continued well in the 20th cen-
tury. So that, perhaps it would not be so groundlessly to think that some original defects
might have escaped a scrutiny of experts and could still take place in the conceptual,
logical or mathematical structure of classical ﬁeld theories. However, a deeper ques-
tion about whether the installation of rigor led to relatively major or minor corrections
in mathematical foundations of hydrodynamics and other ﬁeld theories is, of course, a
matter of additional investigation.

In what follows, our ﬁrst intention is to ﬁx basic conceptions of mathematical hy-
drodynamics. We shall start with the physical background, reminding the motivation
for one or another description of ﬂuids in hydrodynamics. As a branch of mathemati-
cal physics, hydrodynamics deals with a real physical world. Any physical description
implies an observer who can measure and compare measurable quantities. So that,
a logically sound description in hydrodynamics is inconceivable without an idealized
observer.

In general, two complementary types of observers are thought to suﬃce in order to
provide a general description of the ﬂow ﬁeld kinematics or dynamics. The ﬁrst one
(let us call it Lagrangian observer ) identiﬁes individual elements or ﬂuid particles and
follows them along their motion. This idea associates a non-zero hydrodynamic ﬂow
with a non-zero geometrical transformation Ht on the closure Ω0 such that the set HtΩ0
represents the same individual bit of ﬂuid at time t. A position-vector of Lagrangian
observer r = r(t) coincides with the position-vector of an identiﬁed ﬂuid point-particle
in a local coordinate system at rest. Therefore, the set of coupled variables {t, r(t)} can
be naturally used for the mathematical description of ﬂuid quantity f from the point
of view of Lagrangian observer as a function of the type f (t, r(t)). This description is
commonly known as Lagrangian speciﬁcation (or representation) and is valid only if the
identiﬁcation can be maintained by some kind of labeling usually denoting the initial
position r0 at instant t0. Further on, the set of coupled variables {t, r(t)} we shall refer
sometimes as Lagrangian variables.

The second one (let us call it Eulerian observer ) identiﬁes a ﬁxed volume element
or a ﬁxed point of space in a local coordinate system at rest. This observer conceives
a description dissociated from identiﬁcation of individual bits of ﬂuid. It makes use of
the ﬂow quantity f only as a function of local position r and time t, i.e. as a function
of the type f (t, r). Hence, implementation of independent ﬁeld (or Eulerian) variables
{t, r} characterizes mathematical description of ﬂuid quantities from the point of view
of Eulerian observer and represents what is commonly known as Eulerian speciﬁcation.
It has a special signiﬁcance for hydrodynamics and classical electrodynamics, since any
practical attempt of Lagrangian identiﬁcation is unattainable in both cases. Obviously,
viewpoints of Lagrangian and Eulerian observers are complementary to each other. Their

3

convenience depends entirely on a particular context.

The next cardinal matter to be taken into consideration concerns the description of
time variations from the point of view of both observers. The total time derivative for
Lagrangian observer is expressed traditionally in Eulerian ﬁeld variables and is com-
monly known as Euler’s directional (or substantive) derivative. However, just the very
treatment of the time derivative for Eulerian observer looks like a rather delicate point
in the traditional approach. As we shall discuss it further, no equal standards of rigor
are applied in both cases. The rigorization of the conventional formalism may have im-
portant implications for the diﬀerential form of continuity equation as well as for some
other aspects of classical ﬁeld theories and, especially, classical electrodynamics.

2 Two complementary Lagrangian speciﬁcations of ﬂow

ﬁeld

As the ﬁrst step, we shall ﬁx basic concepts and notations of mathematical hydrody-
namics. We begin with the simplest assumptions for an ideal ﬂuid moving in a three-
dimensional Euclidean domain. Let a mapping Ht represent in Lagrangian description
a geometrical transformation of the initial closure Ω0 onto HtΩ0 for the same individual
bit of ﬂuid at time t. Then Ht also represents the function[4]:

where points r and r0 denote the position-vector of the ﬂuid identiﬁable point-particle at
time t and initial time t0, respectively. The velocity of the particle along the trajectory
is deﬁned as:

where the initial position-vector r0 is assumed to be ﬁxed or time independent.

In the context of Eulerian description, a priori there is no identiﬁcation and hence
no explicit consideration of the function r = r(t, r0). The primary notion is the velocity
ﬁeld as a function of position r in space and time t on a ﬂuid domain:

where variables r and t are originally uncoupled.

Picking up some initial point r0 = r(t0), one selects from a congruence (a set of
integral curves of (3)) a unique solution. Thus, a formulation of the initial Cauchy
problem

r = Htr0 = r(t, r0)

v =

r(t, r0) =

r(t, r0)

d
dt

∂
∂t

dr

= v(t, r)

dr

= v(t, r);

r(t0) = r0

is mathematically equivalent to an act of identiﬁcation, allowing any solution of (4) to
be written in the form of (1). There is a general consensus that this procedure can be

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

taken as a rule for translating from one speciﬁcation to the other. However, more close
insight reveals a possibility of a diﬀerent way of translation, alternative to the traditional
procedure. The treatment of time variations from the viewpoint of Eulerian observer
will show why it acquires special signiﬁcance.

Let us explore this alternative. Our purpose here is to deﬁne a new complementary
Lagrangian speciﬁcation by identifying a ﬁnal closure instead of the initial one. We
denote the ﬁnal closure as Ωf and assume that it has always ﬁxed shape and ﬁxed
position in space. For further convenience, all our notation will be accompanied by tilde
when we refer to the Lagrangian description with identiﬁcation of the ﬁnal closure ˜Ωf .
Then some geometrical transformation ˜Ht represents a mapping of the initial bit ˜Ω0 at
instant t0 onto the ﬁnal bit ˜Ht ˜Ω0 = ˜Ωf at instant t. Since the closure ˜Ωf is assumed to
be ﬁxed in a local coordinate frame, the initial closure ˜Ω0 becomes a function of space
and time variables: ˜Ω0 = ˜H −1
˜Ωf (according to one of the postulates of mathematical
hydrodynamics[4] for perfect ﬂuids, the transformation Ht has the inverse H −1
, so there
is no obstacle in assuming the existence of the inverse mapping ˜H −1
). In other words,
the knowledge of the inverse geometrical transformation ˜H −1
allows a reconstruction of
initial bit ˜Ω0 as well as its shape and space position at time t0 from the knowledge of a
ﬁxed ﬁnal closure ˜Ωf at time t.

t

t

When we deal with identiﬁable point-particle, ˜Ht represents the function:

which maps the initial position-vector ˜r0 at time t0 onto ˜rf at time t.

The whole situation can be seen schematically as follows: the initial position of

identiﬁable point-particle depends on a parameter t and on a ﬁxed ﬁnal position ˜rf :

˜rf = ˜Ht˜r0 = ˜r(t, ˜r0)

˜r0 = ˜H −1

t ˜rf = ˜r0(t, ˜rf )

The longer is the lapse of time t − t0, the larger is the distance which a particle should
travel through from ˜r0 to ˜rf .

It is obvious that in the new framework, Lagrangian speciﬁcation can not be linked
to initial Cauchy problem for (3). Only ﬁnal Cauchy problem, as we shall regard it, is
appropriate for that purpose:

d˜r
dt

= v(t, ˜r);

˜r(t, ˜r0) = ˜rf

We remind here that the trajectory ˜r(t, ˜r0) ends in the ﬁxed point of space ˜rf . In whole
similarity with the initial Cauchy problem, the ﬁnal condition ˜r(t) = ˜rf also selects a
unique solution from a congruence (a set of integral curves of the equation (3)). The
set of coupled variables {t, ˜r(t)} we shall refer as Lagrangian variables for ﬁnal Cauchy
problem.

To ﬁnish this Section, we conclude that both geometrical transformations Ht and
˜Ht give Lagrangian description because they advance any identiﬁed ﬂuid point-particle
from its position r0 (or ˜r0) at time t0 to its position at time t. In both cases an imaginary
observer follows the motion of the ﬂuid in the direction of its velocity ﬁeld v. The only

(5)

diﬀerence is that one starts from a ﬁxed initial point r0 and the other ends in a ﬁxed
ﬁnal point ˜rf .
In what follows, let us explore some possible implementations of the
transformation ˜Ht.

3 Fluid quantities and time derivatives for Lagrangian and

Eulerian observers

To clarify our approach, all subsequent analysis will be based on a consideration of one-
component (scalar-ﬁeld) ideal ﬂuid moving in a 3-dimensional space closure. In general
terms, we denote by ﬂuid quantity some regular function f deﬁned on a ﬂuid domain.
Any non-zero ﬂow is characterized by a non-zero velocity vector ﬁeld v and vice versa.
Thus, in Lagrangian description the function f is deﬁned on a set of Lagrangian variables
{t, r(t)}, i.e. as a function of the type f (t, r(t)). If our approach is placed within the
traditional framework, then r(t) is an integral curve of the equation (4) linked to the
initial Cauchy problem. In other words, the transformation Ht:

deﬁnes the mapping of f (t0, r0) along the integral curve r(t) into a new function[5]:

r0 = r(t0) → r(t, r0) = Htr0

f (t0, r0) → Htf (t0, r0) = f (Htt0, Htr0) = f (t, r(t, r0))

where Htt0 = t.

When the Lagrangian description is placed within the alternative framework linked

to the ﬁnal Cauchy problem (7), the geometrical transformation ˜Ht:

˜r0(t0) → ˜r(t, ˜r0) = ˜Ht˜r0 = ˜rf

deﬁnes the mapping of f (t0, ˜r0) along the integral curve ˜r(t) into a new function:

f (t0, ˜r0) → ˜Htf (t0, ˜r0) = f ( ˜Htt0, ˜Ht˜r0) = f (t, ˜r(˜r0, t))

where ˜Htt0 = t.

Both transformations Ht and ˜Ht correspond to Lagrangian description, i.e. represent
the viewpoint of Lagrangian observer who follows the motion of the ﬂuid. Importantly,
the geometrical interpretation based on Ht and ˜Ht (absent at the end of the 18th cen-
tury) gives a necessary clariﬁcation of the concept of ﬂuid quantity. Put in qualitative
terms, one can regard a ﬂuid quantity f (t, r(t)) as a function value f (t0, r0) which is
permanently submitted to a non-zero geometrical transformation Ht, i.e. as a function
of the type f (t, r(t)) = Htf (t0, r0) (note again that Ht is non-zero if and only if the
velocity vector ﬁeld v of ﬂuid ﬂow is non-zero).

In this context, the treatment of time variation of ﬂuid quantities for Lagrangian
observer straightforwardly leads to the classical deﬁnition of the total time derivative

represented in Lagrangian variables:

f (t, r(t)) = lim

f (t, r(t, r0)) − f (t0, r0)

(12)

f (t, ˜r(t)) = lim
t→t0

˜Htf (t0, ˜r0) − f (t0, ˜r0)
t − t0

= lim
t→t0

f (t, ˜r(t, ˜r0)) − f (t0, ˜r0)
t − t0

(13)

Both deﬁnitions (12) and (13) are equivalent so that later on we shall refer only to the
conventional expression (12). Important to note that in this classical deﬁnition of the
total time derivative for Lagrangian observer, a function f is supposed to be submitted
to non-zero geometrical transformation Ht associated with non-zero ﬂow velocity ﬁeld
v.

The next natural step to do is to consider time variations in properly Eulerian
description (i.e.
from the point of view of Eulerian observer). One might anticipate
here that formalistic Euler’s approach had struck at this point, relying on intuitive or
half-intuitive concepts of the 18th century calculus. As a consequence, Euler and his
close followers interpreted a time derivative of ﬂuid quantities for an observer at rest as
a standard partial time derivative:

∂
∂t

f (t, r) = lim
t→t0

f (t, r) − f (t0, r)
t − t0

(14)

where r is a ﬁxed point of space.

What is especially noteworthy about Euler’s ﬁnal result is that even after the obvious
progress in mathematical rigorization of the ﬂuid quantity concept had been achieved
at the end of the 19th century, nobody seemed to have worried about the following
peculiarity. In the classical deﬁnition of a partial time derivative (14), a function f does
not explicitly possess mathematical characteristics of properly ﬂuid quantity (recently,
this fact was also critically pointed out in[6]−[9] but on diﬀerent positions). Anyway,
contrarily to what is explicitly assumed in (12), in the deﬁnition (14) there is no indi-
cation that f is submitted to non-zero geometrical transformation Ht associated with
non-zero ﬂow velocity ﬁeld v. Therefore, (14) is not directly applicable to treat time
derivatives of ﬂuid quantities.

To avoid traditionally formalistic approach (14), let us carefully analyze time vari-
ations of ﬂuid quantities in properly Eulerian description. As a matter of fact, an
observer should be placed at a ﬁxed position of space in order to undertake a study of
any ﬂuid quantity coming through as a function of time. It can be easily achieved if one
substitutes a permanent monitoring of a ﬂuid point-particle by a permanent identiﬁca-
tion of a ﬁxed point of space ˜rf . Firstly, Eulerian observer measures a ﬂuid quantity
f (t0, ˜rf ) carried by a point-particle on its way through ˜rf at instant t0. At time t, the
previous particle has been replaced at ˜rf by another particle, carrying a ﬂuid quantity

7

f (t, ˜r(t, ˜r0)), where ˜r(t, ˜r0) = ˜rf . At time t0 this particle stayed at the point ˜r0 diﬀerent
from ˜rf . Thus, we realize here the necessity of the practical implementation of the ﬁnal
Cauchy problem for a ﬂuid point-particle. This reasoning compels us to introduce a
deﬁnition which takes into account a non-zero geometrical transformation (associated
with a ﬂuid ﬂow) and which, therefore, diﬀers from (14):

d∗
d∗t

f (t, ˜r(t)) = lim
t→t0

˜Htf (t0, ˜r0) − f (t0, ˜rf )
t − t0

= lim
t→t0

f (t, ˜rf ) − f (t0, ˜rf )
t − t0

(15)

where ˜rf = ˜r(t, ˜r0).

At ﬁrst glance, there is no diﬀerence in symbolic notations between the deﬁnition
(14) and the right-hand side of the deﬁnition (15) so that they can be easily confused
in a purely formalistic approach when geometrical transformation ˜Ht is not taken into
account. Later on we shall prove that the mathematical object, deﬁned by (15), virtually
diﬀers from partial time derivative ∂
∂t . To highlight this aspect in our discussions, we
shall denote the total time derivative in Eulerian description by upper asterisk.

As the next step, let us consider analytical expressions for (12) and (15) in Eulerian
variables. The total time derivative is conceived as a linear part of the rate of change
of f with respect to t. Thus, when t − t0 tends to zero, only linear part of geometrical
transformations Ht makes sense for further discussions:

r(t) = r(t0) + (t − t0)(

)t=t0 + o(t − t0) = Htr(t0)

(16)

where r0 = r(t0) is the reference point of the corresponding Taylor series; ( dr
initial velocity of a point-particle at t0.

By analogy, the linear part of geometrical transformation ˜Ht is:

dt )t=t0 is the

˜r(t) = ˜r(t0) + (t − t0)(

)t=t0 + o(t − t0) = ˜Ht˜r(t0)

(17)

where ˜r0 = ˜r(t0) is the reference point of the corresponding Taylor series; ( d˜r
dt )t=t0 is
evaluated at ˜r0 diﬀerent from ˜rf where Eulerian observer is placed. Importantly, for
further discussions we note that the reference point r0 in (16) is ﬁxed in a local coordinate
−1
system whereas the reference point ˜r0 = ˜H
t ˜rf in (17) is a function of a parameter t.

Applying (16) to the deﬁnition (12), one gets:

or Euler’s directional derivative.

Although this is well-known result, it needs some clarifying interpretation. The left-
hand side of (18) is a symbolic expression for the total time derivative for Lagrangian
observer represented in Lagrangian variables of the initial Cauchy problem. The right-
hand side of (18) represents the same result in Eulerian ﬁeld variables. In fact, partial
derivatives ∂f
∂t and ∇f make sense only when variables t and r are independent. Thus,
Euler’s derivative D
Dt allows a calculation of the total time derivative meaningful for

Lagrangian observer but does not require any information on the particle trajectory r(t),
indispensable in Lagrangian speciﬁcation. In other words, Euler’s derivative D
Dt emulates
the total time derivative of properly Lagrangian description in inﬁnitesimal vicinity of the
initial point r0. This interpretation is in agreement with what Euler himself thought two
and a half centuries ago and what is unreservedly accepted nowadays: the directional
derivative D
Dt describes the rate of time variation of material properties following the
motion of the ﬂuid [10].

Let us see what form will take in Euler’s variables the total time derivative (15) con-
sidered by Eulerian observer that remains at rest in a ﬁxed point of space ˜rf . Therefore,
the set {t, ˜rf } represents Eulerian variables for (15). It means that partial derivatives
∂f
∂t , ∇f and the value of ﬂuid velocity v have to be evaluated by Eulerian observer only
locally at ˜rf . This circumstance highlights the obvious inconvenience of the reference
point ˜r0 which appears in the Taylor series (17).
In fact, any local reference system
related to the reference point ˜r0 = ˜H −1
it
is not a reference system at rest). On the other hand, the reference system of Eulerian
observer has to be related to the ﬁxed point of space ˜rf . Hence, a change of the reference
point is required. It can be obtained by rewriting the inﬁnitesimal transformation (17)
as follows:

t ˜rf is a function of a time parameter t (i.e.

d˜r
dt

d˜r
dt

˜r0(t) = ˜rf − (t − t0)(

)˜r0 + o(t − t0)

(19)

where ˜r(t) = ˜rf is a ﬁxed point of space.

Making use of the linearity of the transformation (17), one can conclude that a
ﬂuid point-particle arrives at ˜rf at time t with the velocity equal to the initial one
dt )˜r0 = ( d˜r
( d˜r

dt )˜rf :

˜r0(t) = ˜rf − (t − t0)(

)˜rf + o(t − t0)

(20)

where ˜rf is already the reference point. Let us denote the transformation (20) by Gt.
Note that Gt does not change the arrow of time: Gtt0 = t.

Importantly, both transformations Gt and ˜Ht are equivalent only as inﬁnitesimal
transformations when higher order terms in corresponding Taylor’s series are not taken
into account. Moreover, Gt does not describe any mapping of function values along a
congruence and is necessary only to keep Eulerian observer at a ﬁxed point of space ˜rf ,
counteracting the ﬂow drift. To grasp schematically the underlying idea of (20), one can
fancy an observer on an escalator (automatic staircase) running in a direction opposite
to the direction of the ﬂuid velocity ﬁeld v just to be always in the same point of space
˜rf .

Applying (20) to the deﬁnition (15), one gets the linear part of the time variation of

f with respect to t from the viewpoint of Eulerian observer:

variables instead of ˜rf . This change in notation is justiﬁed by the fact that ˜rf coincides
with the space variable r of a local coordinate system at rest. To make distinction
between Euler’s derivative D
D∗t and call local
directional derivative.

Dt and (21), we shall denote the latter by D∗

The interpretation of (21) is straightforward. The left-hand side is a symbolic ex-
pression of the total time derivative for Eulerian observer represented in Lagrangian
variables of the ﬁnal Cauchy problem, emulating properly Eulerian description. The
right-hand side represents the same result in Euler’s ﬁeld variables. The schematized
interpretation of the transformation (20) as counteraction of the ﬂow drift helps to grasp
the meaning of the negative sign for the velocity value in (21).

Looking at (18) and (21), one can see in explicit terms the diﬀerence between to-
tal time derivatives for Lagrangian and Eulerian observers. Further we shall test the
correctness of the expression (21) analyzing hydrodynamics conservation laws.

4 Fluid quantities and time derivatives in 4-dimensional

notation

Before we proceed to the application of (21), it would be convenient to make a certain
generalization of the previous exposition. Let us choose a 4-dimensional, metric free
framework for the description of an ideal ﬂuid in order to use the notion of Lie’s deriva-
tive as a particularly important generalization of (12) on manifolds without metric. For
this purpose, we add a trivial statement dt
dt = 1 to the diﬀerential equation (3), in order
to use a 4-dimensional notation:

dxi
dt

= V i(x)

(22)

(23)

where x = (x0, x1, x2, x3) = (t, r); V = (1, v). To satisfy the index conventions of
modern diﬀerential geometry, upper indices are used for coordinate functions xi(t),
In further discussions we shall also leave for the time variable x0 its
i = 0, 1, 2, 3.
original denomination t.

Let us formulate the initial Cauchy problem for (22):

dxi
dt

= V i(x)

x0 = x(t0)

where the lower index 0 denotes the initial point on a manifold at t0.

In full similarity with the previous Section, (23) deﬁnes a geometrical transformation
Ht: x0 → x(t, x0) which maps the initial point x0 along the congruence onto x(t, x0).
Two points x0 and x with parameters t0 and t, respectively, are related by the Taylor
series:

dt )t=t0 gives only an inﬁnitesimal

ﬁrst order (linear) operator Htx0 = xi(t0) + (t − t0)( dxi
motion.

If a ﬂuid quantity f (x) is deﬁned on the velocity vector ﬁeld (22), then the trans-
formation Ht describes the mapping of f (x0) along the congruence into a new function
f (x)[5]:

Htf (x0) = f (Htx0) = f (x)

Thus, we arrive at the classical deﬁnition of the Lie derivative LV along the vector
linked to the

ﬁeld V = (1, v) written in the traditional Lagrangian speciﬁcation (i.e.
initial Cauchy problem):

LV f = [

Ht f ]t=t0 = lim
t→t0

[f (x) − f (x0)]

1
t − t0

d
dt

Note that (26) gives a unique diﬀerence and therefore a unique derivative.

When t − t0 is too small, all higher order terms of the kind tn

n! ( dn

dtn )t=t0 (n ≥ 2) vanish

in (24), and the mapping Ht: x0 → x(t, x0) is linear, holding an explicit form:

Htx0 = xi

0 + (t − t0)V i(x0) + o(t − t0)

The transformation (27) gives the linear part of time variation, providing analytic ex-
pression for Lie’s derivative (26) in Eulerian ﬁeld variables:

LV f =

d
dt

f (Ht x0) = V i ∂f
∂xi

If we are in an ordinary Euclidean domain, LV takes a familiar form of Euler’s directional
derivative[5]:

LV f = V i ∂f

∂xi = (

∂
∂t

+ v · ∇)f =

Df
Dt

Therefore, it is worth emphasizing here that the Lie derivative on a diﬀerentiable
manifold and its Euler’s equivalent on an ordinary Euclidean domain are traditionally
deﬁned entirely in the spirit of Lagrangian description, i.e. when a point on a congruence
or a ﬂuid point-particle remain permanently identiﬁed.

The inﬁnitesimal transformation which in the previous Section we regarded as Gt,

takes the following equivalent form in 4-dimensional notation:

Gtxi

f (t0) = xi

f (t0) + (t − t0)V ∗i(xf (t0))

(30)
where V ∗ = (1, −v) and the lower index f denotes a ﬁxed space component rf . Note
again that the transformation (30) does not describe any mapping along the congruence
and makes sense only as inﬁnitesimal one. However, its use is fully justiﬁed, since it
eﬀectively emulates the description of time variations perceived by Eulerian observer. In
4-dimensional notation the inﬁnitesimal transformation Gt: xf (t0) → Gtxf (t0) implies

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

11

the substitution of the function value f (xf (t0)) by f (Gtxf (t0)). In other words, it looks
like some kind of mapping of f (xf (t0)) into f (Gtxf (t0)):

Gtf (xf (t0)) = f (Gtxf (t0))

This formulation allows us to adjust the framework of the conventional deﬁnition (28)
for our attempt to express analytically Eulerian total time derivative on a 4-dimensional
manifold as some kind of Lie derivative on eﬀective local vector ﬁeld V ∗:

LV ∗ f = [

d
dt

f (Gt xf (t0))]t=t0 = V ∗i ∂f
∂xi

Here we shall call V ∗ = (1, −v) as eﬀective velocity vector ﬁeld, since it is meaningful
for Eulerian observer in order to counteract a ﬂow drift.

In an ordinary Euclidean domain (32) takes the form of local directional derivative

established in the previous Section:

D∗f

∂xi = (

− v · ∇)f =

it
Let us remind that this result manifests the viewpoint of Eulerian observer, i.e.
does not imply any sort of identiﬁcation of points on a congruence or ﬂuid elements.
Therefore, the directional derivative (32) deﬁned on a general diﬀerentiable manifold
and on an eﬀective velocity ﬁeld V ∗ should be regarded as a complementary counter-
part of the standard Lie derivative. The character of complementarity between (28)
and (32) is of the same nature as for the relationship between their Euclidean analogies
(29) and (33) given in an ordinary Euclidean domain. Having in mind this similar-
Dt and D∗f
ity with Lie’s directional derivative, we can regard total time derivatives Df
D∗t
for Lagrangian and Eulerian observers, respectively, as complementary 4-dimensional
directional derivatives deﬁned on 4-dimensional space-time manifold.

Both types of directional derivatives Df

Dt and D∗f

D∗t can be analyzed in terms of 1-forms

or real-valued functions of vectors in 4-dimensional manifolds:

ω = (ωi) = (

∂f
∂xi )

where i = 0, 1, 2, 3 and ( ∂f

∂xi ) = ( ∂f

∂t , ∇f ) in an ordinary Euclidean domain.

Now we point out that in tensor algebra the set {ωiV j} are components of a linear

operator or (

) tensor. The formation of a scalar ω(V ) is called the contraction of

1
1

the 1-form ω with the vector V and it is an alternative representation of directional
derivatives:

Df
Dt

= ωiV i;

D∗f
D∗t

= ωiV ∗i

The contraction of diagonal components of the tensor ωiV j is independent of the
basis. Importantly, this law shows that both types of directional derivatives Df
Dt and
D∗f
D∗t are invariant and do not depend on a particular choice of a local coordinate system.

(31)

(32)

(34)

(35)

If there is a metric tensor deﬁned on a manifold, then it maps 1-forms into vectors in a
1-1 manner. This pairing is usually written as:

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

Therefore, from the point of view of tensor algebra, (35) can be represented as a scalar
product in a 4-dimensional manifold with metric:

ωi = gijωj;

V i = gijVj

Df
Dt

= giiωiV i;

D∗f
D∗t

= giiωiV ∗i

where gij = δij is the Euclidean metric tensor. Important to note that Euclidean metric
appears here as an eﬀective metric deﬁned in inﬁnitesimal 4-dimensional vicinity of
(t0, r0) where r0 is the initial point from which Lagrangian observer starts moving with
the ﬂuid.

A Minkowski metric is also consistently singled out for the local directional derivative

D∗f
D∗t :

D∗f
D∗t

= giiωiV ∗i = g∗

iiωiV i

where V ∗ = (1, −v); g∗
ij = diag(1, −1, −1, −1) is indeﬁnite or Minkowski metric tensor.
Similarly, Minkowski metric should be understood here as an eﬀective metric deﬁned
in inﬁnitesimal 4-dimensional vicinity of (t0, rf ) where rf is the ﬁxed point of space in
which Eulerian observer is placed.

One of the advantages of the scalar product form is that it gives orthonormal bases
for space-time manifolds. For Lagrangian description, a basis is Cartesian and a trans-
formation matrix Λc from one such basis to another is orthogonal matrix:

′gij = Λ
These matrices Λc form the symmetry group O(4).

Likewise, for Eulerian description a Minkowski metric picks out a preferred set of
bases known as pseudo-Euclidean or Lorentz bases. A transformation matrix ΛL from
one Lorentz basis to another satisﬁes:

ΛL is called a Lorentz transformation and belongs to the Lorentz group L(4) or O(3, 1).
The point that needs to be emphasized here is the remarkable circumstance of
properly Eulerian description in evoking of the Minkowski metric without any previous
postulation. In other words, consistent mathematical description of ﬂuids is also per-
fectly compatible with the Lorentz symmetry group. From the complementary stand-
points of Lagrangian and Eulerian observers it is clear that both kinds of total time
(or 4-dimensional directional) derivatives are valid only in their complementary con-
texts. Hence, it also concerns the complementary relationship between Euclidean and
Minkowski metrics. In what follows we shall conﬁne our attention on some practical
implications of (33) in the classical ﬁeld theory.

5 Fluid contents in Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions

R

Let us now consider a ﬂuid f -content in a 3-dimensional space domain V , i.e a volume
f dV . Here we assume the function f fulﬁls all standard conditions
integral of the type
on integrability that allows us to consider not only smooth or continuous integrand func-
tions but a more general class of ﬂuid quantities with spatial discontinuities which may
take place in many practical examples (for instance, some extra particles of dust mov-
ing in water introduce ﬁnite discontinuity into ﬂuid density). Nevertheless, regarding
discontinuities, we shall restrict our approach only by the simplest class or elementary
discontinuities of ﬁnite size. Inﬁnite or delta-function types of discontinuities need ad-
ditional suppositions on integrability and, therefore, can be taken into consideration
elsewhere on a more rigorous basis.

In properly Lagrangian description V is an identiﬁed macroscopic volume domain
moving with a ﬂuid. If the bounding surface of a closure always consists of the same
ﬂuid particles regardless any change of shape of the volume V then, as a result, no
ﬂuid ﬂows through the volume surface. Obviously, no time variation of a ﬂuid content
takes place and a mathematical description can be used to express a conservation of
f -content. If the above condition is not fulﬁlled and Lagrangian observer identiﬁes all
ﬂuid particles coming in and out the closure, there is a general expression of the time
variation, commonly known under the name of the Convection Theorem[4],[10]:

f (t, r(t))dV =

+ f ∇ · v)dV

(41)

d
dt Z
V (t)

(

Df
Dt

Z
V (t)

In the left-hand side of (41) both volume V (t) = HtV (t0) and a ﬂuid quantity
f (t, r(t)) = Htf (t0, r0) are permanently submitted to a non-zero geometrical transfor-
mation Ht, i.e. they are given in Lagrangian speciﬁcation linked to the initial Cauchy
problem whereas the right-hand side represents the same result in Eulerian independent
variables of the local reference system at rest. If there is no ﬂux through the surface, the
Convection Theorem gives the conservation of the ﬂuid f -content. The restriction on
conservation is usually written in the standard diﬀerential form of continuity equation:

Df
Dt

+ f ∇ · v =

∂f
∂t
The point of view of Eulerian observer is complementary. He picks out a ﬁxed 3-
dimensional volume V0 and studies a ﬂuid f -content as a function of time. Since the
volume element is now ﬁxed, the traditional formalistic approach (see (14) in the Section
3) takes the time derivative of Eulerian observer for the partial time derivative:

+ ∇·f v = 0

(43)

In order to express the restriction on conservation when the time variation of f -
content is not zero, (43) should be equaled to the ﬂuid inﬂow or outﬂow through a

14

bounding surface ∂V0 of the volume V0. It immediately leads to the integro-diﬀerential
form of continuity equation:

∂f

V0

dV = −

f v·dS = −

∇·f vdV

Z

(44)

The remarkable circumstance that the diﬀerential form of (44) coincides with (42) de-
rived for the volume V (t) in motion, is traditionally associated with the cross-veriﬁcation
of the standard diﬀerential form of continuity equation (42). However, from the Sec-
tion 3 we know that, generally speaking, partial time derivatives do not represent time
derivatives of ﬂuid quantities perceived by Eulerian observer. What attitude should we
take then on the fact that the Convection Theorem leads to the result obtained in the
formalistic approach (43) which in no way refers to ﬂuid quantities? In fact, we claim
here to have come across another mathematical blunder in the very demonstration of
the Convection Theorem. Elimination of defects implies mathematical modiﬁcations in
the conventional form of (41) (see Appendix A):

f (t, r(t))dV =

+ f ∇ · v)dV

(45)

d
dt Z
V (t)

(

Z
V (t)

where the set {t, r} represents Eulerian ﬁeld variables associated with the local reference
system at rest.

Before going further with implementation of the modiﬁed version of the Convection
Theorem (45), let us substitute (43) by a rigorized description of the time derivative
for Eulerian observer (see (15) in the Section 3). As a matter of fact, the terminology
of the Lagrangian description linked to the ﬁnal Cauchy problem provides us with the
appropriate framework. Put in quantitative terms, Eulerian observer measures a ﬂuid
quantity f (t0, ˜rf ) carried by a point-particle on its way through ˜rf at instant t0. At
time t, the previous particle has been replaced at ˜rf by another particle, carrying a ﬂuid
quantity f (t, ˜r(t, ˜r0)). If we apply this procedure to all ﬁxed points of space which form
part of the ﬁxed volume Vf , then we arrive at the integral formulation:

d
dt Z
Vf

f (t, ˜r(t))dV = lim

t→t0 Z
Vf

f (t, ˜r(t, ˜r0)) − f (t0, ˜rf )
t − t0

(cid:21)

(cid:20)

dVf

(46)

where ˜r(t, ˜r0) = ˜rf so that both values of f represent the ﬂuid property at the same
point of space ˜rf .

The right-hand side of (46) makes use of Lagrangian variables of the ﬁnal Cauchy
problem. If Eulerian variable are implemented, then according to (21) (or (33)), the
time variation of f -content for Eulerian observer takes the following form:

f (t, ˜r(t))dV ]t=t0 =

− v · ∇f )dV

(47)

In our derivation of this general result we assumed that the gradient ∇f is deﬁned as a
continuous function in all point of a ﬂuid domain.

To mark out the fact of complementarity between this Eulerian description (for ﬁxed
volume domains) and the Lagrangian description (for volumes in motion) regarded as the
Convection Theorem (45), from now on we shall call the result (47) as local Convection
Theorem providing the following formal formulation:

Theorem 1 (Local Convection Theorem): Let v be a vector ﬁeld generating a ﬂuid ﬂow
through a ﬁxed 3-dimensional domain V and if f (r, t) ∈ C 1( ¯V ), then

f dV =

− v · ∇f )dV

d
dt Z
V

(

∂f
∂t

Z
V

(48)

where dV denotes the ﬁxed volume element.

Note that (48) is also applicable to arbitrary 1- and 2-dimensional closures of ﬂow
domains. Mathematical soundness of this theorem can be easily seen on a simple 1-
dimensional example considered in Appendix B.

Since the volume domain Vf is ﬁxed in a local reference system at rest and the
ﬂow vector ﬁeld v is supposed to be non-zero, then a time variation of f -content is
unambiguously related to a ﬂux of ﬂuid through the bounding surface ∂Vf . Thus, if (47)
equals the right-hand side of the equation (44), we obtain a modiﬁed integro-diﬀerential
version of f -content conservation law:

(

∂f
∂t

Z
Vf

− v · ∇f )dV = −

f v · dS = −

(∇·f v)dV

(49)

Z
∂Vf

Z
Vf

As integral form of the general conservation law, (49) should make sense for contin-
uous as well as for spatially discontinuous ﬂows. In points of spatial discontinuity of the
function f , gradients ∇f have singularities, hence invalidating the integrability proper-
ties of integrands in both sides of the equation (49). This diﬃculty is surmounted by itself
when we realize that gradients ∇f , which appear in both sides of (49), mutually cancel
each other. However, the problem remains open for the standard integro-diﬀerential
form of the conservation law. In fact, in the case of discontinuity of f , the right-hand
side of (44) contains a singularity which can not be canceled.

If the volume Vf in (49) tends to zero, we obtain a modiﬁed diﬀerential form of

continuity equation:

∂f
∂t

+ f ∇ · v = 0

(50)

Therefore, it is worthy to note that in the case of ﬁnite spatial discontinuities of the
function f , the partial diﬀerential equation (50) does not possess untractable inﬁnities
related to the gradient ∇f . However, these singularities still take place in the standard
diﬀerential form of continuity equation (42).

16

The usefulness of the concept of conservation of ﬂuid f -content comes from its gen-
erality and also from its capability of cross-veriﬁcations of the results obtained in com-
plementary Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions. Thus, turning back to (45), if there
is no time variation, the right-hand side equals to zero and in the left-hand side we
arrive again at the same conclusion (50) by means of the modiﬁed Convection Theo-
rem. The question about whether the previous cross-veriﬁcation based on ill-founded
considerations (41) and (43) was just that stumbling block which hindered the process
of rigorization of foundations of classical ﬁeld theory, deserves some special clariﬁcations
elsewhere. Let turn our attention on possible implications of the above-stated results
for classical electrodynamics.

6 Local Convection Theorem and Maxwell’s equations

Another interesting task would be an application of the local Convection Theorem (48)
to the integral form of Maxwell’s equations. To implement Eulerian description in hy-
drodynamics, one needs the knowledge of ﬂuid quantities and the velocity ﬂow ﬁeld
as functions of Eulerian variables in a local reference system at rest. The situation
is somewhat diﬀerent in the case of classical electrodynamics. Evidently, a priori un-
known nature of the velocity vector ﬁeld for electromagnetic ﬁeld components cancels
the validity of hydrodynamics common sense. However, virtual applicability of the local
Convection Theorem looks like viable if, for instance, we restrict our approach to the
consideration of ﬁnite size charged particles moving with a constant velocity (if in the
limited case, the charge is of a delta-function type, then we suppose that some additional
conditions are added to the formulation of the local Convection Theorem (48) in order
to be applicable to this type of charge density discontinuity).

In fact, Einstein’s special relativity theory ﬁrmly established the equivalence of in-
ertial frames of reference in classical electrodynamics. If a single electric charge is at
rest in a local frame then its electromagnetic ﬁeld components do not explicitly depend
on time from the point of view of an observer in uniform motion. In other words, if we
are in the observer’s inertial frame, electric ﬁeld components will keep up appearances
with straight lines coming out of the charge source. Therefore, if the charge velocity vq
is known, the velocity vector ﬁeld v = vq for components of electric and magnetic ﬁeld
is also deﬁned in the whole closure V0.

Let us formulate Maxwell’s equations in this particular case of one charge system
(microscopic version), using general notations. For Eulerian observer all kind of space
closures (volumes, bounding surfaces or curves) are ﬁxed in a local frame of reference
at rest. The ﬁrst pair of Maxwell’s equations does not refer to any time variation and
describes the source of electric E and magnetic H ﬁeld, respectively:

E·dS =

∇ · EdV = 4πQ;

H·dS =

∇ · HdV = 0

where V0 is a ﬁxed volume; S0 is a closed surface bounding V0 and Q is a whole electric
charge inside V0.

The diﬀerential formulation of (51) is

∇ · E = 4πρ;

∇ · H = 0

where ρ is the charge density.

The second pair of Maxwell’s integral equations refers to the time variation of electric
E and magnetic H ﬁeld ﬂuxes through a ﬁxed open surface S0 bounded by a closed curve
C0:

Let us introduce a ﬂuid quantity f as a scalar product of two vectors A and n,
deﬁned on the surface, i.e. f = A · n, where A is some general vector ﬁeld and n is
a unit vector normal to the surface. Since the local Convection Theorem (48) is also
meaningful for 1- and 2- dimensional ﬂow domains, it can be easily checked out that:

Despite of the limited validity of hydrodynamics approach to electromagnetic ﬁeld
description, we make here an attempt to use (55) in the Eulerian representation of the
second pair Maxwell’s integral equations (53) and (54) as follows:

If in this hydrodynamic formulation the velocity ﬂow ﬁelds v for electromagnetic
components E and H are known, then the time derivative from the viewpoint of Eulerian
observer is also deﬁned in explicit terms as D∗

D∗t = ∂

∂t − v · ∇.

On the other hand, Maxwell’s equations are compatible with the charge conserva-
tion law. Since velocities of charge particles are measurable values, their knowledge

(56)

Applying a general expression valid for any vector ﬁeld E (or H):

(v · ∇)E = v(∇ · E) − [∇, [v, E]]

and having in mind the ﬁrst pair of Maxwell’s source equations (52) we arrive at:

(v · ∇)E = 4πj − [∇, [v, E]];

(v · ∇)H = −[∇, [v, H]]

where j = ρv.

It is worth reminding here that our approach to integral formulation of Maxwell’s
equation has been originally submitted to a consideration of uniformly moving charged
particle. In this case the time dependence of ﬁelds is implicit and all partial time deriva-
tives vanish from (61). Substituting (63) into (61), we arrive at the well-established
relationship between quasistatic magnetic and electric ﬁeld strengths of uniformly mov-
ing charge or magnetic source, respectively[11]:

1
c
where v is the velocity of a source.

H =

[v, E];

E = −

(64)

1
c

Note that (64) makes sense only from the viewpoint of Eulerian observer placed in the
local inertial reference system at rest so that no use of the special relativity relationships
for ﬁeld transformations has been necessary.

It is very important to stress here that in our attempt to reconsider basic diﬀerential
equations, we leave without any modiﬁcation the original integral form of continuity as
well as Maxwell’s equations. Note that this is the only form (not diﬀerential one) which
had been veriﬁed by experiments. So that no additional experimental conﬁrmation
of these fundamental laws is implied in this approach.
In fact, in this work we call
into question whether the conventional mathematical procedure of the transition from
integral equations with total time derivative for ﬂuid quantities to their diﬀerential form
is correct. On the other hand, the diﬀerential form of continuity as well as Maxwell’s
equations constitutes the standard basis for providing mathematical solutions for the

19

classical electromagnetic theory. Hence what kind of diﬀerential equations of classical
electrodynamics have been under a scrutiny of experts for more than a century?

The major fact that emerges from the above considerations is that there appear two
conﬂicting approaches to the diﬀerential form of Maxwell’s equations from the viewpoint
of Eulerian observer. The traditional one is indiﬀerent to any speciﬁc manifestations of
ﬂuid quantities, treating the time derivative for an observer at rest as a simple partial
time derivative ∂
∂t . The other starts out the same integral formulation of Maxwell’s
equations but the time derivative for Eulerian observer no longer coincides with the
partial one. There appears an extra term v · ∇ which is one of the outcomes of the
non-zero ﬂow velocity ﬁeld, in what case it can be regarded as a convective term.

Therefore, the denial of the exclusive use of partial time derivatives to describe time
variation for an observer at rest and a recognition of a deeper underlying meaning of the
total time derivative in Eulerian description imply inevitable changes in the structure of
mathematical solutions to Maxwell’s equations (as regards this aspect, some alternative
frameworks for classical electrodynamics were recently discussed in [6],[12]−[15]). How-
ever, a wider analysis of the integral form of Maxwell’s equations on basis of the local
Convection Theorem does not look tractable at present stage. Perhaps, it is possible
to approach a description of electromagnetic ﬁeld of a classical spinning charged parti-
cle using above-considered approximations. Nevertheless, the question about whether
some postulates are indispensable in this and general cases should be studied carefully
elsewhere.

7 Conclusions

In this work we attempted to get a more detailed insight towards some traditional aspects
of mathematical and conceptual structure of theoretical hydrodynamics. We found that
no equal standards of rigor take place in Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions. The
reconsidered account provides a rigorous analytical approach to the treatment of time
derivatives in properly Eulerian description. To avoid traditional formalistic approach
in which the total time derivative of Eulerian observer is taken for the partial time
derivative, we realized the necessity of the practical implementation of the ﬁnal Cauchy
problem for velocity ﬁeld diﬀerential equation. It justiﬁed a new deﬁnition for the total
time derivative of Eulerian observer which was regarded in this work also as the local
directional derivative. The point that needs to be emphasized here is the complementary
character of the above introduced concept. It can be considered as a complementary
counter-part of the well-known Euler’s derivative.

By no means, the local directional derivative substitutes the Euler mathematical
construction. By contrary, it is shown that both types of total time derivatives for La-
grangian and Eulerian observers (which could be interpreted also as two complementary
4-dimensional directional derivatives) are equally valid but should be used in diﬀerent
contexts.

One of the interesting conclusions of the analytic expression for both 4-dimensional
directional derivatives is that the choice between Lagrangian and Eulerian types of

20

ﬂow ﬁeld speciﬁcation is equivalent to the choice between space-time manifolds with
Euclidean and Minkowski metric respectively. Therefore, a consistent mathematical
description of ﬂuid kinematics can be also compatible with the Lorentz group symmetry.
Although our approach was restricted by the consideration of one-component (scalar)
ideal ﬂow ﬁeld, the notion of the local directional derivative can be easily generalized
on Lie’s derivatives for any general tensor ﬁeld on diﬀerentiable manifolds. Both types
of Lie’s derivative will correspond to both complementary types of descriptions.

The concept of local directional derivative has been also applied to analyze time
variation of ﬂuid contents in Eulerian description. The result has been formulated in
form of a theorem called here as the local Convection Theorem meaningful for ﬁxed
space domains. Therefore, it should be refer as complementary to the Convection The-
for space domains moving with a
orem established for Lagrangian description, i.e.
ﬂuid. Another unexpected outcome of the approach developed in this work consists in
modiﬁcation of the standard diﬀerential form of continuity equations. It also implies a
reconsideration of the diﬀerential form of Maxwell’s equations since they are compatible
with the law of charge conservation, i.e continuity equation for the charge density.

In place of concluding remark let us remind asserting and encouraging attitude of a

great mathematician. Gauss once wrote in his letter to Bessel (quoted from[2])

...One should never forget that the function [of complex variable], like all
mathematical constructions, are only our own creations, and that when the
deﬁnition with which one begins ceases to make sense, one should not ask,
what is, but what is convenient to assume in order that it remain signiﬁcant...

APPENDIX A. Modiﬁed version of the Convection Theorem

Let us consider a ﬂuid f -content (which we shall denote by F =
macroscopic volume domain V (t) is identiﬁed and is moving with the ﬂuid:

R

f dV ) when a

F (t) =

f (t, r(t))dV

Z
V (t)

(65)

In the framework of traditional Lagrangian description linked to the initial Cauchy
problem, it implies the existence of non-zero geometrical transformation Ht (associated
with non-zero velocity ﬂow ﬁeld v):

V (t) = HtV (t0);

f (t, r(t)) = Htf (t0, r0)

(66)

21

Since the time derivative of F (t) is going to be treated here, we have to consider

only linear part of geometrical transformations Ht when t − t0 tends to zero:

r(t) = Htr0 = r0 + (t − t0)v + o(t − t0)

(67)

where r0 = r(t0) belongs to the initial volume V (t0) = V0 and v =( dr
value of ﬂow ﬁeld velocity.

dt )t=t0 is a local

The geometrical transformation Ht is algebraically represented by the Jacobian de-
which for the inﬁnitesimal transformation (67) takes the following

terminant det
form[16]:

Thus, the evolution of a ﬂuid content F (t) can be written in original variables r0 if

(68)

Let us now analyze the time derivative of a ﬂuid f -content:

F (t) =

d

F (t) =

V0

f (t, r0) [1 + (t − t0)∇ · v + o(t − t0)] dV0

(71)

Importantly, in the representation (69) of the integrand function f (t, r0) space vari-
able r0 does not already depend on time parameter t. Put in other terms, the expression
(69) implements the Eulerian independent variable r0 for the integrand function f (t, r0)
and the integration volume V0 instead of the Lagrangian ﬂow variable r(t) used in (65).
The original time dependence of the function f (t, r(t)) through Lagrangian variable r(t)
is now replaced by the time dependence of the Jacobian determinant. Therefore, since
r0 is assumed to be time independent in (71), the time derivative of f (t, r0) coincides
with the partial time derivative according to the classical deﬁnition:

Thus we arrive at the modiﬁed version of the Convection Theorem:

f (t, r0) =

From these considerations it is now clear that the conventional approach took the

partial time derivative (72) for Euler’s directional derivative Df
Dt .

APPENDIX B. Example of applicability of the Local Convection Theorem

To highlight mathematical soundness of the local Convection Theorem (47) let us
consider a simple example of 1-dimensional ideal ﬂow deﬁned on a ﬁxed 1-dimensional
interval [a, b] on x-axis. Let the set {t, x} be Eulerian variables and f a regular function,
for instance:

Additionally, the ﬂuid ﬂow is deﬁned by the velocity vector ﬁeld v:

f (t, x) = t + x3

dx
dt

= v(t, x) =

t
x2

Let us choose some ﬁxed point ˜xf from the interval [a, b] and formulate the ﬁnal
Cauchy problem for the equation (75). It is equivalent to the deﬁnition of Lagrangian
variables {t, ˜x(t)} for some identiﬁed point-particle:

v(t, ˜x) =

d˜x
dt

=

t
˜x2 ; →

˜x2d˜x =

tdt

(76)

t

Z
t0

Note again that in any solution of the ﬁnal Cauchy problem, the initial starting point
˜x0 is a function of t0, t and ˜xf :

˜x3(t0, t, ˜xf ) = ˜x3

f +

t2

Let us now calculate separately the time variation of the ﬂuid f -content considered
in both parts of the local Convection Theorem (47). We ﬁrst evaluate the left-hand side
integral:

f (t, ˜x(t))d˜xf =

[˜x3

f (t, ˜x(t))d˜xf = (1 − 3t0)(b − a)

taken under the condition t → t0.

The right hand-side of (47) considers f -quantity in Eulerian independent variables
{t, ˜xf }. Since xf coincides with space variable of the local x-axes at rest, we shall use
for it the common notation x (i.e. without tilde). Partial derivatives are calculated at
t0 in all ﬁxed points x from [a, b]:

dx
dt
and we proceed to the evaluation of the following integral:

vection Theorem to the ideal ﬂuid ﬂow deﬁned by (74) and (75):

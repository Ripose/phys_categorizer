Abstract

The simulation of the transition sequence of superheated Type I supercon-
ducting granules (SSG) in disordered suspensions when an external magnetic
ﬁeld is slowly increased from zero has been studied. Simulation takes into
account diamagnetic interactions and the presence of surface defects. Results
have been obtained for the transition sequence and surface ﬁelds distribution
covering a wide range of densities. These results are compared with previ-
ous analytical perturbative theory, which provides qualitative information on
transitions and surface magnetic ﬁelds during transitions, but with a range of
validity apparently limited to extremely dilute samples. Simulations taking
into account the complete diamagnetic interactions between spheres appear
to be a promising tool in interpreting SSG experiments, in applications such
as particle detectors, and in some fundamental calculations of Solid State
Physics.

I. INTRODUCTION

The study of the electric and magnetic properties of inhomogeneous or disordered sys-
tems has been a subject of long-standing interest in both basic and applied condensed matter
physics. Historically, studies of these properties have usually dealt with the determination of
eﬀective parameters (typically dielectric constants) on a longer spatial-scale than the typical
scales of the inhomogeneities or the disorder1. However, in superconducting granular mate-
rials the situation is more complex and interesting. These systems, in response to applied
ﬁelds, can suﬀer transitions which depend on details at the disorder scale. Moreover, as will
become evident below, local ﬁelds change at every transition, which makes the response of
the whole system history-dependent. In this context, mean or eﬀective properties of these
materials are of limited interest.

Measurements on superconducting granular materials can provide interesting information
from a fundamental point of view. For example, the measurement of the supercritical ﬁelds
of disordered suspensions of superconducting granules has yielded determinations of the
Ginzburg-Landau parameters of the superconducting transition2. On the other hand, the
superheated-to-normal phase transitions of Type I superconducting suspensions, induced by
irradiation, have served as the basis for the recent development of particle detectors3; also
the irradiation-induced supercooled normal-to-superconducting transition of granular arrays
is being explored4 with respect to dark matter detection in astroparticle physics.

In a superconducting granular material, the transition of each granule is determined by
its position in its phase diagram, which is schematically shown in Fig. 1. Type I super-
conductors exhibit hysteresis, so a granule can traverse the equilibrium curve Bc without
transiting as long as it remains in the metastable region. In Fig. 1 we show the case of
an isolated metastable superconducting granule. It can be seen that the actual normal to
superconducting transition, whether induced by a ﬁeld increase ∆B or heating ∆T , depends
critically on its location in the (T,B) phase space referred to the superheating ﬁeld curve
Bsh. Theoretically, this location is given by the bath temperature and the maximum ﬁeld
on the surface Bmax = (3/2)Bext. Experimentally, the location generally varies over a small
range of ﬁelds as a result of surface and volume defects which act as nucleation centers5,6. In
contrast, a disordered suspension exhibits a broader range of transition ﬁeld values7,8, which
is generally due both to defects and to diamagnetic interactions between the superconduc-
tors themselves. This spreading depends directly on the local ﬁelds on the surface of the
granules, information which is not directly accessible in experiments, and can reach typical
values of 20%. Analogous behavior has been found in superconducting granule detectors,
in which transitions occur by incident energy from particles or radiation. In this case the
uncertainty in the minimum energy necessary for the transition necessarily hinders the in-
terpretation of the results of these devices7. On the other hand, the long-range nature of the
diamagnetic interaction produces changes in the surface ﬁeld values for the entire system as
each transition occurs. In consequence, the suspension disorder and its eﬀects change with
each transition. Therefore, it is clear that a complete theoretical analysis of diamagnetic
interactions and their eﬀects on transitions constitutes a ﬁrst step in the interpretation of
experiments involving this kind of suspensions.

There exist numerous theoretical results available on magnetic or (mathematically analo-
gous) electric properties of disordered materials. These are mainly for the eﬀective dielectric

2

constant of composites, involving mean ﬁeld calculations, such as the classical mean-ﬁeld
Clausius-Mossotti or Maxwell-Garnett9 approximation, rigorous bounds10,11, or cluster ex-
pansions for suspensions of polarizable spheres12,13. Analogous expansions have been devel-
oped for the diamagnetic properties of superconducting sphere suspensions. In the regime
of dilute suspensions, Geigenm¨uller14 constructed a perturbative theory which is not limited
to eﬀective properties, but which calculates statistics of local surface ﬁelds on the granules
and of the transitions induced by the external ﬁeld. This theory is formally based on a
cluster expansion in such a way that all the quantities are expanded in powers of the volume
fraction ρ occupied by the microgranules.
In practice, the expansion is performed up to
ﬁrst order, which means that only two-body interactions are considered14. Nevertheless, it
provides the only analytical framework in which experiments have been interpreted so far.
In this paper we will study the magnetic properties of a disordered ensemble of (type I)
superconducting granules immersed in an external magnetic ﬁeld by numerical simulation.
We speciﬁcally address the question of the diamagnetic interactions between granules, and
the process of the successive transitions in the system induced by an increase of the external
ﬁeld. Relevant information, which is not experimentally accessible, such as local surface
ﬁeld values, is obtained during transitions. Conditions on which these transitions occur
(essentially the external ﬁeld values) are the crucial point in the applications mentioned
above. The comparison of the simulation results to the perturbative calculation shows that
the problem in interpreting experiments is twofold. Firstly, direct application of the pertur-
bative results, which are valid in the dilute regime in principle, uses linear extrapolations
of the experimental results to the zero-density limit as parameters of the theory. As we
will show, the validity condition of this procedure (i.e. that experiments lie in the proper
range of validity of the theory) is hardly fulﬁlled by current experimental results. Therefore,
quantitative predictions are expected to fail in all density ranges. Secondly, some interest-
ing results arise in measurements performed in high-density conditions, where diamagnetic
interactions are most important and the perturbative theory does not apply. This is the
case for instance of the experimental determination of the supercooling branch of the phase
diagram and its associated Ginzburg-Landau parameters.2 In each branch of a hystheresis
loop, the last transiting granules are expected to be the most defect-free ones. Contrary to
the superheating case, in a supercooling situation these granules are most aﬀected by dia-
magnetic interaction of other superconducting granules. In view of all these circumstances,
both the quantitative determination of the limits of validity of the perturbative calculation,
and the use of simulation to obtain results valid in the whole density regime are of prime
interest.

The structure of this paper is the following. The simulation procedure is described
in detail in Section II. Results obtained for representative cases, presented in Section III,
show the critical importance of diamagnetic interactions in the transitions of disordered
superconducting suspensions, and quantitatively demonstrate the limited range of validity
of the perturbation theory. In Section IV some conclusions are drawn from this work.

We performed simulations of dispersions of N superconducting spheres of radius a sited
in positions given by Ri in a thin cylindrical sample of thickness L and radius α × L.

Positions were chosen at random in the prescribed volume excluding conﬁgurations in which
the distance between the centers of any couple of spheres is d ≤ 2a. An external ﬁeld Bext
applied to the system was considered. The radius of the spheres was considered much greater
than the London penetration length, and the transitions of each sphere to the normal phase
are completed when the local magnetic ﬁeld on any point of its surface reaches a threshold
value Bth. Hence, we do not consider partial transitions to the intermediate state. This
is justiﬁed when the local magnetic ﬁeld applied over a sphere is greater than the critical
magnetic ﬁeld Bc, and thus the sphere is in a metastable state14. Neither the possible
eﬀects of diamagnetic contact and associated percolation phenomena for very concentrated
conﬁgurations were considered. The magnetic ﬁeld B(r) can be determined from a scalar
potential U(r)

which satisﬁes the Laplace equation

B(r) = −∇U(r),

∇2U(r) = 0.

with the following boundary conditions. Firstly, for any superconducting sphere the mag-
netic ﬁeld is tangential to the surface, i.e. the normal derivative of the potential vanishes
there. Secondly, the value of the ﬁeld very far from the sample should match Bext:

U(r) → −r · Bext (r → ∞).

The scalar potential U(Rj + rj) near sphere j can be expanded in multipoles14,15 which,
introducing the boundary conditions at the surface of the sphere, can be written as

where the constants Aλµ λ′µ′(j, k) are given in Ref.16. Without loss of generality, in Eq. (6)
we have placed the external ﬁeld in the z-direction. After determining the values of the
unknowns cλµ(j) and K(j) for a given conﬁguration, it is possible to calculate the surface
ﬁelds from Eq. (4).

The constants K(j) only give additive contributions to the potential and do not aﬀect
the magnetic ﬁeld values, so the problem is, in principle, to solve the inﬁnite set of linear
equations (6) for the unknown c’s. In practice one only takes into account a limited number
of multipolar terms according to the desired precision. Even then, the number of unknowns
is so large that a direct solution of the Eqs. (6) is a formidable task for conﬁgurations with
a representative number N of spheres. Instead, we employ the following iterative method16.
Eq. (6) can formally be written as a matrix equation for the vector of unknown c

whose solution is

The simplest way to numerically perform this expansion is to apply the iteration

(10)
(11)

The dependence of the A matrix elements on the distance between the spheres guarantees
the convergence of this expansion, which is faster for more dilute systems. The desired
precision is achieved by iteratively applying Eq. (10) until the change of the coeﬃcients c is
lower than a prescribed value.

The procedure in our simulations is then as follows: N superconducting spheres are
placed at random in the desired geometry according to the value of the given ﬁlling factor
ρ (fraction of volume occupied by the microgranules). The threshold values Bth for every
sphere are also assigned by using a given distribution. Applying the iterative method de-
scribed above, the values of the coeﬃcients c are obtained, which enables determination of
the local values of the magnetic ﬁeld on the surface of any sphere from Eqs. (1,4). The
maximum value of the surface ﬁeld for each sphere is then calculated by standard routines
of minimization of multivariate functions. The comparison of these maximum surface ﬁelds
with the respective values of Bth permits selection of the ﬁrst superconducting sphere that
will transit to normal under an increase of the applied magnetic ﬁeld. Furthermore, the
precise value of Bext at which the transition occurs is monitored. Subsequently, the system
becomes one of N − 1 superconducting spheres. The long-range nature of the diamagnetic
interactions changes the surface magnetic ﬁeld values of the remaining superconducting
spheres on any transition. This leads us to repeat the same calculation process after each
transition until all spheres have transited.

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

For the simulations we have employed a distribution of values of Bth consistent with
experimental results for tin microspheres diluted in paraﬃn17. A parabolic distribution ﬁt is

5

14,15. This distribution of Bth values was obtained
used in the interval between 0.8Bsh and Bsh
from experimental data corresponding to systems with small ρ extrapolated to ρ = 0. The
number of initially superconducting spheres employed in simulations was N = 250 for dilute
dispersions with ρ values from 0.001 up to 0.05, and N = 150 for denser systems with ρ up
to 0.20. For each case we performed averages over a number of independent conﬁgurations
between 2 to 7. The geometrical ratio α was chosen to be 10. This large value of α makes
ﬁnite-size eﬀects important for the larger volume fractions employed. Indeed for ρ = 0.20 a
system of N = 150 has a width of only 4.6 sphere radius, and hence cannot be considered as
truly 3- dimensional. However, it also avoids the appearance at these densities of percolating
clusters associated to diamagnetic contact, which in fact has been ignored in simulations.

The fraction f of remaining superconducting spheres during an increase of the external
ﬁeld is shown in Fig. 2 versus Bext for diﬀerent values of ρ. The furthest to the right
continuous line in this ﬁgure shows the expected behavior for isolated spheres, for which
the maximum surface ﬁeld is equal to 3/2Bext, and therefore can be directly related to the
distribution of Bth values. We see that for the most dilute case (ρ = 0.001) the f values
closely follow that ρ = 0 limit, except for a few transitions occurring earlier than expected
corresponding to spheres whose distances to the nearest neighbor are not very large (about
0.10 − 0.15 times the radius value). Therefore, for such a dilute case, the observed spread
in the transition ﬁeld values can be attributed to surface defects. However, Fig. 2 shows
transitions for increasingly lower external ﬁelds as the concentrations of the sample are
increased. This enhanced spread in the transition ﬁelds is produced by the diamagnetic
interactions between spheres in these more densely packed conﬁgurations, which generate
local surface ﬁelds much higher than the externally applied ﬁeld and are the origin of the
observed dependence on the sample ﬁlling factor. We see that diamagnetic interactions
start to be the most important factor in transition spreading for ﬁlling factors of a few per
cent. Indeed half of the spheres have undergone transitions at Bext = 0.48Bsh for ρ = 0.20,
while for ρ = 0.001 a ﬁeld Bext = 0.60Bsh is required. Similar behavior was observed in
the experimental results of Dubos and Larrea18. In these experiments half of the spheres
transited at Bext = 0.48Bsh for ρ = 0.25, at Bext = 0.50Bsh for ρ = 0.20, and Bext = 0.53Bsh
for ρ = 0.04. This agreement conﬁrms that the mechanisms implemented in the simulations
(presence of surface defects and inﬂuence of diamagnetic interactions) are essentially correct.
These results suggest an analysis of our results in terms of the perturbative theory of
Geigenm¨uller14, which takes into account these mechanisms under the same hypotheses (ig-
noring partial transitions, diamagnetic contact, etc) assumed in our numerical simulations.
This theory performs a systematic expansion of quantities such as the surface ﬁeld distri-
bution and the transition sequence in powers of the ﬁlling factor. Within the framework of
this expansion we can write14:

f (Bext, ρ) = f0(Bext) + ρf1(Bext) + O(ρ2)

(12)

where the zeroth order is the same ρ = 0 prediction represented in Fig. 2. This expansion
shows how the distribution of Bth can be obtained from experimental data by performing
measurements on samples of diﬀerent densities and extrapolating the results to ρ → 014,15,17.
In this expansion, each order can be calculated from this distribution of threshold ﬁelds Bth,
and involves increasingly higher order contributions both in the number of spheres and in
multipolar interactions. In the present state of the theory, calculations are done up to ﬁrst

6

order, which is equivalent to considering only two-body interactions.

The comparison between our simulations and the results of the Geigenm¨uller theory
should permit one to deﬁne the range of validity of the linear approximation, and provide
an insight into the eﬀects of higher order terms. To this end Fig. 2 also shows the predictions
of Eq. 12 and Ref.14 for ρ = 0, 0.01, 0.05 and 0.10 as continuous lines. We see that the
theory does contain the observed trend of transitions to occur for lower external ﬁelds due
to diamagnetic interactions, but agreement does not seem to be quantitative except for
extremely dilute samples. For the 5% case agreement appears to be rather poor and it is
worse for denser systems.

A more appropriate test of the linear approximation involved in Eq. 12 is the study
of the dependence of f on the density ρ for diﬀerent values of Bext. This is shown in Fig.
3, where symbols represent simulation results and lines are the perturbative predictions of
Eq. 12. Note that the evolution of a system during successive transitions is represented by
points at constant ρ and increasing values of Bext. We see that the perturbative calculation
of Eq. 12 provides a correct qualitative picture of the transitions. However, for intermediate
values of Bext, the diﬀerences between theory and simulations begin to be non-negligible at
volume fractions between 2 - 5%. These results further indicate that ρ → 0 extrapolations
of experimental results, performed in order to obtain information on the distribution of
values of Bth, should only be made with very dilute systems. This may explain the apparent
discrepancies between theory and experiment found in Refs.14,17, where the values of f0 and
f1 were evaluated by linear extrapolations of experimental data up to ρ = 5%. In view of Fig.
3, this procedure should yield erroneous results in the range of the most interesting values of
Bext, where transitions mostly occur. It is precisely in this range where the contribution of
f1 in Eq. 12 is more important, so it is here where a breakdown of the perturbative scheme
is expected14. We will address this point below.

The study of the maximum values of the magnetic ﬁeld on the surface of the granules
is the key point in analyzing the transitions, as pointed out above. This is a quantity
that is not accessible to direct experimental measurements. The theory of Geigenm¨uller
provides estimates of the distribution of values of such maximum ﬁelds in the small-density
expansion14:

P (Bmax, ρ) = P0(Bmax) + ρP1(Bmax) + O(ρ2)

(13)

In this equation P (Bmax, ρ) stands for the fraction of superconducting spheres with a maxi-
mum surface magnetic ﬁeld smaller than Bmax. We have omitted the implicit dependence of
such quantities on Bext. P0(Bmax) is the step function θ(Bmax − 3/2Bext), i.e. the result for
isolated spheres. The linear term describes the broadening of the distribution due to mag-
netic interactions14. These interactions change at each transition during the increase of the
external ﬁeld, and therefore are history dependent. This is the reason why the broadening
described by P1 depends on Bext.

The problem of a systematic expansion in ρ of quantities such as the distribution
P (Bmax, ρ) is that by its own nature the zeroth order is discontinuous, while the eﬀect
of a ﬁnite ρ should smooth it. However, it is impossible that a linear correction such as Eq.
13 could do this job for all values of ρ. In fact, looking closely at the prediction of Eq. 13
around Bmax = 3/2Bext we can check that there exists a discontinuity and the distribution
function ceases to be monotonous. This breakdown of the perturbative theory is shown in

7

Fig. 4, where we represent the predictions of the theory for a dilute case (ρ = 0.01) and
a concentrated case (ρ = 0.20) at an applied external ﬁeld Bext = 0.5Bsh. At this value of
Bext all transitions are exclusively due to diamagnetic interactions, and whereas for dilute
systems only a small fraction have occurred, for more concentrated conﬁgurations the system
is deeply immersed in the transition sequence. We see that two branches appear on both
sides of the discontinuity at Bmax = 3/2Bext. While both branches are close to each other
for small ρ and one could use some criterion to connect them, for large ρ this is not the case.
We have chosen to use the right-hand side branch in such situations to extract quantitative
information and to compare it with simulations.

In Fig. 5 we show simulation and perturbative results of the distribution P of maximum
surface ﬁelds for systems at Bext = 0.2Bsh and diﬀerent initial values of ρ. These results are
almost identical to the results without transitions of Ref.16. For this value of the external
ﬁeld, only a reduced number of spheres have already transited, and what one sees is the
result of the diamagnetic interactions on almost completely disordered conﬁgurations of
superconducting spheres. Again, although the perturbative theory qualitatively describes
the diamagnetic eﬀects, namely the broadening of the maximum ﬁeld distribution, it only
appears as quantitatively correct for very small values of the occupied volume fraction. In
Fig. 6 we show the analogous results for an external ﬁeld Bext = 0.6Bsh. For this ﬁeld
the system has already suﬀered a large number of transitions except for the extremely
dilute conﬁgurations. Here the convergence of the perturbative expansion is expected to
be rather limited, and, in fact, its non-analytical behavior at Bmax = 3/2Bext is clearly
seen. However the perturbative theory (the right-hand side branch) continues to provide
satisfactory qualitative predictions. Note that the maximum ﬁeld distributions are much
narrower after this increase of the external ﬁeld. In fact, when a large number of spheres
have transited induced by the external ﬁeld, those that remain superconducting are expected
to form quite ordered conﬁgurations19,20, and, as a consequence, the surface ﬁeld values
become more uniform in the sample19. This feature is captured by the perturbative theory.
In order to show the ordering eﬀect of the transitions more clearly we present the evolu-
tion of the distribution P during the increase of Bext for three systems with representative
values of the ﬁlling factor: ρ = 0.001 (Fig. 7), ρ = 0.01 (Fig. 8) and ρ = 0.20 (Fig. 9).
For each ﬁlling factor, both simulations and perturbative results are shown for values of the
external ﬁeld ranging from 0.2Bsh up to 0.6Bsh, for which most transitions occur. We see
again that the broadening of the ﬁeld distribution is drastically reduced as the external ﬁeld
is increased. The results indicate discrepancies between the perturbative theory and the
simulations for the lowest values of Bext even for very dilute systems. However, agreement
improves as Bext increases and the systems undergo transitions.

The results obtained for the most dense system with a volume fraction ρ = 0.20 (Fig. 9)
are particularly interesting: the large discrepancies observed at Bext = 0.2Bsh evolve to a fair
agreement for Bext = 0.5Bsh or Bext = 0.6Bsh. In Fig. 10 we characterize the distribution of
maximum surface ﬁelds for this ﬁlling factor by its mean and its standard deviation values,
which are represented versus the increasing external ﬁeld and compared with the perturba-
tive theory. One feature of the theory that is visible here is that it predicts transitions only
for external ﬁelds greater than 0.2Bsh. We see that the surface ﬁelds approach the isolated
sphere values as Bext increases, whereas the standard deviation approaches zero indicating
an increase of the uniformity of the system. We also see that the theory approaches the

8

simulation results quite satisfactorily for external ﬁelds greater than 0.4Bsh.

This agreement after transitions between simulations and a small density approximation
is quite surprising for such a dense case, and appears to be better than that obtained for
low densities and low external ﬁeld. One possible explanation could be that when a large
number of transitions have occurred, the eﬀective ﬁlling factor (if we only take into account
the remaining superconducting spheres) is smaller, and one could expect a better convergence
of the ρ-expansion. However, this agreement corresponds to systems with eﬀective volume
fractions after transitions that are higher than in the low ﬁeld systems represented in Figs.
7 and 8 for ρ = 0.001 and 0.01. This can be seen in Fig. 11, where we have represented
the mean and standard deviation of the maximum surface ﬁelds versus the eﬀective ﬁlling
factor ρef for the dense system with initial ρ = 0.20. In this ﬁgure the evolution of the
system is to decreasing values of ρef . We already see good agreement for ρef = 0.1, which
is a rather large value. To show this, in Fig. 9 we have also represented the distribution of
maximum ﬁelds for a conﬁguration with the same ρef (slightly lower than 0.1) than that of
Bext = 0.5Bsh, but with positions completely at random, and the corresponding predictions
from perturbative theory. Note the good agreement between theory and simulations for the
system which has been ordered by transitions compared with the discrepancies observed for
the last random conﬁguration with the same eﬀective ﬁlling factor. We can conclude that the
perturbative theory implicitly includes the observed tendency to form ordered conﬁgurations
of remaining superconducting spheres, and that it describes these resulting conﬁgurations
quite well, even if they arise from much more concentrated initial systems. However this
good behavior of the theory is not completely explained by the decrease of the eﬀective
ﬁlling factor during the transition process.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have performed numerical simulations of disordered suspensions of su-
perheated superconducting granules (SSG), transiting to normal when an external magnetic
ﬁeld is slowly increased from zero. Transitions are controlled by the local surface magnetic
ﬁelds, which depend in a non-trivial way on the geometrical conﬁguration of the supercon-
ducting granules via strong diamagnetic interactions, and the presence of surface defects.
Performed simulations employ complete resolutions of the Laplace equation for the magnetic
ﬁeld with suitable boundary conditions on the surface of the superconducting spheres, and
therefore are expected to provide results which are not limited to dilute samples. Consistent
comparison with previous experimental results indicates that the simulations capture the
mechanisms involved in the real system, and their use in simulations appears to be essen-
tially correct. A better comparison with experimental results might need a revision of the
Bth distribution. Also the employ of a larger number of spheres in simulations could be
necessary to reduce ﬁnite-size eﬀects16. On the other hand, the numerical method can be
straightforwardly generalized to SSG conﬁgurations with spheres of diﬀerent sizes. Prelimi-
nary simulations with realistic size distributions show the same qualitative behaviour than
obtained with spheres of equal radius.

Transition sequences as a function of the (increasing) applied ﬁeld have been obtained
for a large range of granule concentrations. Distributions of local maximum surface ﬁelds,
a relevant quantity in interpreting SSG experiments but not directly measurable, have also

9

been obtained. Results indicate a non-negligible eﬀect of diamagnetic interactions between
spheres, even for dilute systems, manifested in transitions occurring for lower external ﬁelds.
These interactions appear as the most dominant factor in transitions for ﬁlling factors start-
ing at a few per cent. The distribution of maximum surface ﬁelds becomes wider for denser
conﬁgurations owing to diamagnetic interactions, but successive transitions induced for these
interactions reduce the dispersion of these surface ﬁelds. This homogenising eﬀect is asso-
ciated with a positional ordering of the remaining superconducting spheres, and should be
an important factor in reducing the energy uncertainty in detection applications of SSG
systems.

We have compared simulation results of both transitions and surface ﬁeld distributions
with the analytical cluster expansion of Geigenm¨uller14. Theory and simulations share the
same mechanisms (diamagnetic interactions and surface defects), and the same hypothesis
(not considering partial transitions nor diamagnetic contacts) in modeling SSG systems.
However the theory has been developed up to ﬁrst order in the ﬁlling factor, which limits
the calculation to two body interactions. Simulation results show that the perturbative
theory qualitatively predicts the behavior of the system, namely the dependence of the
transitions and the maximum surface ﬁelds on the concentration of the sample and on the
value of the external applied ﬁeld. However, perturbative theory is quantitatively correct
only for very dilute samples, with occupied volume fractions of at most 1 - 2%. This range
of validity increases for systems initially at higher densities after having undergone a large
number of transitions. The ordering of these resulting conﬁgurations is well described by
the theory.

As a ﬁnal conclusion, diamagnetic interactions appear to be a factor of fundamental
concern in SSG systems. Results from perturbative expansions, although providing a very
useful framework for analyzing experiments, have a rather limited range of validity, and
should be used with caution in obtaining quantitative information. In particular, extrapola-
tion to the zero concentration limit of experimental data should only be performed for very
dilute samples, within the validity range of the expansion. The use of simulations to obtain
results for all densities should become an essential tool in interpreting SSG experiments.
In this sense, generalization of the theoretical framework in which both simulations and
perturbative theory are based could be essential to analyze very concentrated systems, in
which partial transitions due to diamagnetic contact can occur.

These results, or more properly the numerical techniques in obtaining them, may also
be of interest in a re-examination of the earlier Ginzburg-Landau parameter determinations
from multi-grain measurements of the supercooled-to-superconducting transition. This nu-
merical approach should also be of use in areas of condensed matter physics other than
superconductivity, such as viscous ﬂuid ﬂow through a disordered porous medium, where
similar equations arise, or investigation of the magnetic properties of ultrathin ferromagnetic
ﬁlms21.

FIG. 2. Fraction f of spheres that remain superconducting versus Bext/Bsh, after an increase
of the external magnetic ﬁeld from zero, for diﬀerent occupied volume fractions ρ. Symbols rep-
resent simulation results. From right to left, continuous lines correspond to predictions of Eq. 12
and Ref.14 for ρ = 0, 0.01, 0.05 and 0.10. The case of ρ = 0 is the dilute limit, i.e. assuming a
maximum surface ﬁeld of 1.5Bext for all the spheres.

FIG. 3. Fraction f of spheres that remain superconducting in function of ρ for several values
of the increasing Bext. Symbols are simulation results: (◦) Bext = 0.30Bsh, (×) Bext = 0.40Bsh,
squares Bext = 0.50Bsh, (∗) Bext = 0.53Bsh, (⋄) Bext = 0.55Bsh, (+) Bext = 0.58Bsh, (△)
Bext = 0.60Bsh, (•) Bext = 0.62Bsh, full squares Bext = 0.65Bsh. From the top to the bottom,
continuous lines are predictions of Eq. 12 and Ref.14 for the same values of Bext.

FIG. 4. Fraction P of spheres with maximum surface ﬁeld lower than the x-axis value (in units
of Bext), obtained from Eq. 13 and Ref.14, when the external magnetic ﬁeld has reached the value
0.5Bsh, for ρ = 0.01 and ρ = 0.20. The right branch was chosen to extract quantitative information.

FIG. 5. Fraction P of spheres with maximum surface ﬁeld lower than the x-axis value (in units
of Bext), when the external magnetic ﬁeld has reached the value 0.2Bsh, for several values of ρ.
Continuous lines are the corresponding predictions of Eq. 13 and Ref.14

FIG. 6. Fraction P of spheres with maximum surface ﬁeld lower than the x-axis value (in units
of Bext), when the external magnetic ﬁeld has reached the value 0.6Bsh, for several values of ρ.
Continuous lines are the corresponding predictions of Eq. 13 and Ref.14

FIG. 7. Fraction P of spheres with maximum surface ﬁeld lower than the x-axis value (in
units of Bext), corresponding to an initial ρ = 0.001 for several values of external magnetic ﬁeld
Continuous lines are the corresponding predictions of Eq. 13 and Ref.14

FIG. 8. Fraction P of spheres with maximum surface ﬁeld lower than the x-axis value (in
units of Bext), corresponding to an initial ρ = 0.01 for several values of external magnetic ﬁeld
Continuous lines are the corresponding predictions of Eq. 13 and Ref.14

13

FIG. 9. Fraction P of spheres with maximum surface ﬁeld lower than the x-axis value (in
units of Bext), corresponding to an initial ρ = 0.20 for several values of external magnetic ﬁeld.
The results for a system with the same number of spheres that remain superconconducting in
the case of Bext = 0.5Bsh but placed at random are also represented. Continuous lines are the
corresponding predictions of Eq. 13 and Ref.14 Dashed line corresponds to the prediction for the
random conﬁguration.

FIG. 10. Mean and standard deviation values(in units of Bext) corresponding to the distribution
of maximum surface ﬁelds versus the increasing external ﬁeld for initial ρ = 0.20. The results from
the simulations and from the perturbative theory (GT) are represented.

FIG. 11. Mean and standard deviation values(in units of Bext) corresponding to the distribution
of maximum surface ﬁelds versus the resulting eﬀective ﬁlling factor ρef . The results from the
simulations and from the perturbative theory (GT) are represented for a system with initial ρ = 0.20
through progressive increasing of the external ﬁeld.

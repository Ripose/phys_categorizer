We study the stochastic dynamics of Brownian particles in a heat bath and subject to an active
feedback control by an external, Maxwell’s demon-like agent. The agent uses the information of
the velocity of a particle and reduces its thermal agitation by applying a force. The entropy of the
particle and the heat bath as a whole, thus, reduces. Entropy pumping [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 120602
(2004)] quantiﬁes the entropy reduction. We discover that the entropy pumping has a dual role of
work and heat contributing to free energy changes and entropy production of the open-system with
the feedback control. Generalized Jarzynski equality and ﬂuctuation theorems for work functional
and entropy production are developed with the presence of the entropy pumping.

Modern nano-technology allows an active control of
the position and velocity of nano-devices by feedback
systems. The systems detect the velocity and posi-
tion of the nano-devices and manipulate a velocity- and
position-dependent external force applied to the devices.
We name such controls as position-dependent feedback
control (PFC) and velocity-dependent feedback control
(VFC), respectively. The latter has recently been ac-
complished in reducing the thermal noise of a cantilever
in atomic force microscopy (AFM) [1] and dynamic force
microscopy [2]. In [1], the feedback system detects the ve-
locity of the cantilever and reduces its thermal vibration
by actively switching the direction and magnitude of a
force that controls the cantilever. A VFC experiment has
also been proposed to control a frictional force acting on
a small array of particles by limiting the terminal velocity
of the array with a terminal attractor [3]. The physics
principle of the VFC is to reduce the entropy of nano-
devices and its surrounding environment, as a whole. The
control agent can be considered as a Maxwell’s demon,
who gathers informations of nano-devices and use them
to reduce the entropy. The entropy reduction has also
been widely studied in the context of engineering control
theory [4] and has long been suggested as a fundamental
principle of life [5].

In [6], as a simple model for the entropy reduction,
we studied a Brownian particle in heat bath under a
friction-like force manipulated by a VFC. As the system
evolves with time, the particle is eventually settled in
its stationary state. In the stationary state, the average
kinetic energy of the particle is lower than the surround-
ing heat bath since the ﬁction-like external force reduces
the thermal ﬂuctuations of the particle. Kinetic energy
is transferred from heat bath to the particle and is ul-
timately absorbed by the external control agent. The
entropy of the heat bath, therefore, decreases in the sta-

tionary state, and the particle and the control agent act
as a microscopic refrigerator. To quantify the entropy
reduction, a mesoscopic thermodynamic theory has been
developed in [6] where we have shown that the entropy
of the particle and the heat bath changes due to both
positive entropy production and entropy pumping by the
external agent [6]:

d(S + SH)
dt

=

dt

+

dSpu
dt

,

where dS and dSH are entropy change in Brownian par-
ticles and heat bath, respectively, and dSp is entropy pro-
duction and dSpu is entropy pumping by a control agent.
In the case of the friction-like control, dSpu is negative.
In its stationary state, dSp + dSpu becomes negative. We
note that the entropy production, dSp, is always positive
due to the irreversible process of Brownian dynamics and
this implies the second law of thermodynamics.

The entropy reduction mechanism by the entropy
pumping is a unique feature of VFC. Without the VFC
but only with PFC, the entropy pumping term vanishes
[6] and the entropy of the particle and the heat bath,
as a whole, always increases due to the positive en-

of the particle does not change, so the entropy of the
heat bath always increases. This implies that in the sta-
tionary state with PFC alone, heat transfers on aver-
age from the system to the heat bath due to the fric-
tional dissipation of work done to the particle by the
external agent. Therefore, the particle and the control
agent cannot act as a microscopic refrigerator but as a
heater without VFC! The Jarzynski equality and ﬂuctu-
ation theorems for entropy production and work func-
tional [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] have been studied
only in systems with the PFC. Thus a novel question
arises: How are they modiﬁed with VFC? The present
work answers this question. Let us formulate this ques-
tion by focusing on the Jarzynski equality. The second
law of thermodynamics is mathematically an inequality:
the external work done on a system in contact with a

heat bath,

where ∆F

nally, we get inequality:
plies that, with the presence of VFC, entropy pumping
modiﬁes the stochastic work functional in the Jarzynski
equality. The 2nd law of thermodynamics can be quanti-
tatively described by entropy production ﬂuctuation the-
orem [7, 8, 10] and work ﬂuctuation theorem [11, 12].
These theorems are closely related to Jarzynski equality.
So, they also need to be extended.

We discover that entropy pumping has a dual role of
heat and work contributing to free energy change and the
ﬂuctuation theorems. The former role is already men-
tioned in the previous paragraph. The latter role can be
seen from entropy balance: dSp = dS + d(SH
Spu).
The second law of thermodynamics states that the en-
tropy production dSp is positive. Then, in the stationary
state, d(SH
Spu) > 0. This implies that entropy pump-
ing modiﬁes the heat bath entropy contributing to the
ﬂuctuation theorems.

Thermodynamics – We ﬁrst deﬁne several terms. An

the surrounding heat bath. An external system is the

g(v) and internal potential change due to the change of
α(t).

We deﬁne stochastic heat dQ(t) [6, 10, 16], stochastic
entropy of the Brownian particle dS(t) [10], and stochas-
tic entropy pumping dSpu(t) (in the introduction, the
same notations were used, but hereafter S, Sp, and Spu
are stochastic.) [6]:

These are all stochastic quantities since (xt, vt) has a
stochastic trajectory. The entropy change in heat bath
is given due to its isothermal quasi-static nature,

dSH (t) = βdQ(t),

with β = 1/TH. The entropy balance is expressed by

dS + dSH = dSp + dSpu.

(6)

The Eq.(6) can be considered as the deﬁnition of stochas-
tic entropy production, dSp. Entropy change of the inter-
nal system is due to not only entropy production but also
entropy pumping. Finally, energy balance is expressed as

dH = ∂tHdt+∂xHdx+∂vHdv = ∂tHdt+gdx

tities are deﬁned with Stratonovich prescription, which
is known to be physically meaningful [17].

Entropy Pumping – In [6], we have found that entropy
pumping is related to momentum phase space contraction
due to g(v) (dSpu/dt = ∂vg(v)). The extended ﬂuctua-
tion theorems derived above show a novel role of entropy
pumping: a dual role of work and heat. The work func-
tional W in the Jarzynski equality and the work ﬂuctua-
tion theorem is modiﬁed into W
TH∆Spu as in Eq.(11)
and (16), and heat dissipation Q, i.e., entropy of heat
bath SH is modiﬁed into SH
Spu as in Eq.(10), (12),
and (13). The reason of the duality is easy to understand
from energy balance Eq.(7): ∆H = W
TH∆SH . When
SH is modiﬁed, W also needs to be modiﬁed with ∆H
unchanged.

Conclusion Remarks – Nano-scale mesoscopic systems
with VFC are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the widely stud-
ied overdamped stochastic systems with PFC [18]. The
key diﬀerence is that the former involves an active en-
tropy reduction mechanism like a Maxwell’s Demon. We
have recently developed a rigorous mesoscopic thermo-
dynamic theory for such systems with VFC [6]: from the
standpoint of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, a friction-
like VFC makes the heat ﬂow into Brownian particles
from the heat bath and then be taken out to the external
control agent in the form of mechanical energy. However,
from the standpoint of the second law, not all the heat
can be converted into mechanical energy. Otherwise, we
would have a perpetual motion machine of the second
kind. This is the paradoxical part of a Maxwell’s De-
mon. This paradox is resolved by considering the Brow-
nian particles and demon-like external agent as one whole
system. Since the Brownian particles cannot be treated
as one whole system, a question, ‘what constitutes the
stochastic work contributing to the change in free energy
of the Brownian particles?’, arises.
In this Letter, we
have shown that the stochastic work and entropy pro-
duction appearing in Jarzynski equality and ﬂuctuation
theorems should include entropy pumping contribution
due to a dual role of entropy pumping as work and heat.
With this modiﬁcation, we are able to extend all the pre-
vious results to systems with VFC.

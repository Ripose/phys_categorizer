Introduction.

Many ﬁelds of science are in need of the long wavelength and broadband radiation sources with a
continuous spectrum. The blackbody sources and sources of spontaneous incoherent synchrotron and
1 GeV and higher are used in this case. Such
undulator radiation based on storage rings of the energy
sources are eﬀective in optical and harder regions of spectra. In IR and longer wavelength regions of
spectra only monochromatic radiation sources like lasers (masers), free-electron lasers, traveling-wave
tubes, klystrons and so on are eﬀective.

∼

The problem of high power long wavelength and at the same time broadband sources with continues
spectrum is open now. One of the possible ways to solve this problem is the way using the coherent
radiation of short bunches of relativistic electrons passing through the external ﬁelds or through or
near material bodies (Cherenkov, transition, diﬀraction radiation).

Eﬀective generation of coherent radiation is possible when the electron bunch-length is less or
comparable with the emitting wavelength. It means that the spectrum of the broadband sources is
limited from the short wavelength region by the electron bunch length.

At present all accelerators and special bunching systems produce periodical trains of bunches
under a deﬁnite bunching frequency. It means that all generators based on such beams will emit line
spectrum radiation at bunching frequency and their harmonics. Line nature of the spectrum can be
displayed in the long wavelength region. In this case to generate spectrum similar to continuous one
the distance between bunches must be much (some orders) greater then the wavelengths of the emitted
radiation.

Modern high energy linear accelerators using electron guns with thermal cathodes and bunchers
can produce now electron bunches of the length
1mm and less. New technology connected with
∼
electron guns based on laser photocathodes permits to produce shorter bunches. Bunchers based on
undulators and lasers permit to produce a long train of very short microbunches at the bunching
frequency of the lasers but such train of microbunches could not be used in the long wavelength and
broadband sources of the coherent radiation with a continuous spectrum.

In this paper we search diﬀerent schemes of coherent radiation sources.

Notice also that this conclusion is valid when the distance R in (1) is much greater then the
dimensions of the emission region [1], [2]. In this case we can consider that the radiation is emitted
from small (point-like in comparison with R) region and propagate under the same direction deﬁned
2. However the conditions can be
by the constant unite vector ~n and at the constant distance R = Ro
realized when the particle pass through two regions A and B and the distances between this regions
and observation point are near the same. Under such conditions particle can emit two waves with
strange parameters ~IA 6
= 0 when the initial and ﬁnal velocities of the particle are zero.
These waves will come to the observer under diﬀerent angles (diﬀerent unite vectors ~nA, ~nB) and with
. They can be selected this place by splits or concave mirrors [3],
diﬀerent values of the vectors
[4]. Such waves will have increased intensity in the long wavelength region and can be used this place
or after separation at more distant places. When the distance from each region to the observation
point is much greater then the distance between regions then in this case ~IA =
~IB, ~I = 0 and the
eﬃcient conditions for the long wavelength radiation are absent. One of the important elements in
the projects of the long wavelength radiation sources based on the relativistic electron beams can be the
selection elements.

The fruitful idea of the formation zone was introduced in [5], [6]. But this idea works well under
conditions when the distance from all emitting regions to the observer is much larger then distances
between these regions and theirs dimensions and when there is no focusing and other elements between
these regions capable to destroy the interference between the emitted wavepackets. The total spectrum
of the emitted radiation passing through the closed surface including regions A and B depends on the
shape of the surface and it’s distance from the emitting regions.

Electromagnetic radiation (electromagnetic waves) can be emitted by charged particles in free
space only under conditions of nonuniform (accelerated) motion of the particles. This statement
fallow from the expressions (1),(2) describing the electromagnetic ﬁeld strengths and power of the
emitted radiation. When the uniformly moving charged particle (projectile particle) pass through a
transparent medium and near or through a material body or a system of bodies it emit Cherenkov and
transition (diﬀraction) radiation respectively [5]. One speaks that in this case the radiation is emitted
by uniformly moving particle. However this is spoken for simplicity and convenience. In reality in
this case the energy of the emitted radiation is taken from the extraneous forces source. This source
transform the energy to the projectile particle support it on the constant level and through this particle
transform it to particles of the medium. The particles of the medium undergo the acceleration and
hence emit radiation and decelerate projectile particle with the force equal to and directed backward
to the extraneous force. No waves go away from projectile particle.
If the extraneous forces are
absent, then the heavy projectile particle will be decelerated by ﬁelds induced by media particles but
the electric ﬁeld strength and hence the energy of the wave emitted by the projectile particle will
be much less then the ﬁeld strength and the energy emitted by particles of media. In this case the
total radiation will be emitted by the accelerated particles of media and by the accelerated projectile
It means that according to these common positions all known kinds of radiation can be

Usually the electron beams of linear accelerators consist of trains of bunches. Each train (impulse)
is repeated with some industrial frequency fo and each bunch in the train is repeated with some bunch-

3 Stimulation of the energy lost of particles in the external ﬁelds

by an open resonator.

A scheme of the source based on coherent radiation of bunched relativistic electron beam in external
ﬁelds and intensiﬁed by an opened resonator is presented in the Fig.1. On this Figure the external
ﬁelds are presented by an ordinary banding magnet.

Electron beam from a linear accelerator enter the vacuum chamber installed in a bending magnet
at the angle α1 to the axis y, pass trough a thin ﬂat metal mirror M 1, go along an arc through
magnetic ﬁeld which is built up from zero to a maximum value Bm at the length of the order of the
gap of the bending magnet and then exit from the resonator at the angle α2 to the axis y through
the hole (or through a thin foil installed in the hole) of the second spherical concave mirror M 2 of
the resonator. Some hole (window) in resonator mirrors or small mobile mirror M3 inserted in the
resonator can be used to extract the stored radiation from resonator.

Electron bunches in the magnetic ﬁeld will emit radiation in the form of a train of short wave
packets. This wave packets will be stored in the cavity for some time determined by losses in the
cavity (quality of resonator). If the bunching frequency is equal to the oscillating frequency of the
wavepackets in resonator (when the electron velocity v is near to the light one and double distance
between mirrors is multiple to the distance between electron bunches) and the quality of resonator is
high then the wavepackets of the emitted radiation will be overlapped. The value of the electric ﬁeld
strength and the power of the stored wavepackets will be proportional to the eﬀective number and
to square of the eﬀective number of stored wavepackets (photon bunches) accordingly. This way the
resonator will enhance the power of the emitting radiation. In this case the conversion of the electron
beam energy to the energy of the electromagnetic radiation will go mainly through the interaction
of the transverse electric ﬁelds of the stored wavepackets with transverse components of the electron
velocities obtained by electrons in the magnetic ﬁeld but not through the self-decelerating ﬁelds.

The length of the stored wavepackets is much smaller then the length of the resonator. It means

that in this case a high number of the longitudinal modes will be exited in the resonator.

When the combination of plain mirror and spherical mirror is used, then the waist of the photon

beam will be at the ﬂat mirror and the radius of the waist will be determined by the expression

sign near one semi-period sine form of duration ∆t = a/cγ2 (see Fig 2a). The wavepackets of single
sign components of the electric ﬁeld strengths present strange electromagnetic waves. The spectrum
of such wavepackets stretch up to zero frequencies. In this case the spectral density of the emitted
radiation take on maximum value. This is to be expected that this conditions will be optimum for

electromagnetic radiation emitted by particles in the direction of the axis y will present strange

The transition radiation will be emitted by electron in the ﬂat mirror. This radiation corresponds
to instantaneous start of the electron and its image of opposite charge on the mirror surface in the
10−6
opposite directions [5]. The duration of the wavepacket of the transition radiation is very small (
cm). This wavepacket has single sign form of the electric ﬁeld strength and hence present ”strange
wave radiation” [8]. The signs of the electric ﬁeld strengths of radiation emitted in the magnetic ﬁeld
and in mirror are opposite. That is why the modulus of the strange parameter (6) of the total radiation
does not depend on the value of the magnetic ﬁeld and deﬁned by (6) under condition ~β1 = 0.

In general case (H

= 0, αi are arbitrary) particle bunches will not interact with stored transi-
tion radiation and hence will not amplify it as the electric ﬁeld strength of the radiation stored in
opened resonator near by the mirrors surfaces (where the transition radiation is emitted) has not both
longitudinal and tangent components.

When an electron is going along the axis y and enter the mirror M1 and when the magnetic ﬁeld
is switched oﬀ (α1 = α2 = 0) then the transition radiation will be stored in the resonator but it will
not be ampliﬁed as the stored radiation in opened resonator has only transverse components of the
electric ﬁeld strengths and the electron velocity has only longitudinal component 5.

The scheme presented in the Fig.1 is the scheme of the prebunched (parametric) free-electron laser
(fel) based on one banding magnet. Usually a system of banding magnets of the alternate polarity
(undulators) is used in similar schemes. The theory of the prebunched fel will be presented in the
next section. We propose that this theory in the ﬁrst approximation will be valid for short (one or a
half period) undulators that is for the case considered in this section.

4 Prebunched free-electron laser based on an undulator and on an

open resonator.

A schematic diagram of the parametric (prebunched) free-electron laser based on an undulator is pre-
sented in the Fig.3. Some elements of the theory of such lasers based on open resonators was developed
in [9]. Experimental investigation of the parametric free-electron laser using cylindrical resonator was
made in [10]. Theory of such schemes does not completed. Now we present a development of the
theory of such lasers for the case of the helical undulator of the arbitrary length 6. This theory will
permit to estimate the power emitted in the previous scheme. A short (one period) undulator is
drawn in the Fig.3. Such undulator with high deﬂecting parameter will permit to generate the long
wavelength broadband radiation.

~β(t + T ) = ~β(t), where T is the period of the particle oscillations in the undulator, m = 1, 2, 3...K,

resonator such a way that the total wavepacket of the length Kλ1 will be installed after the time

5 Transition radiation sources.

5.1 Introduction to the theory of the transition radiation.

The transition radiation appear when an electron or other charged particle pass through (cross) a
boundary between two media with diﬀerent indexes of refraction. The shape and dimensions of the
boundary can be arbitrary. A plane metal mirror in vacuum is one of the examples of such boundary
10−5 cm) regions in
(see Fig.4). The transition radiation in the real mirrors is emitted from a small (
the form of semi-sphere layers of the same thickness originated from the points of the electron entrance
in and exit from the mirror.

∼

The image method of calculation of the transition radiation can be used when the mirror have
inﬁnite dimensions and conductivity.
In this case the transition radiation of the falling electron is
equivalent to the strange radiation emitted by the electron and positron which moved from inﬁnity
in the opposite directions with equal velocities and stopped at the boundary of the mirror. The
transition radiation of the electron emerging from the mirror corresponds to the instantaneous start
of the electron and it’s image at the mirror surface 9. In this case the spectral-angular distribution of
the emitted radiation will be determined by the eq-s (4),(6) for the case β1 = 0 and for opposite signs
of the charges and directions of the electron and it’s image velocities

Fig.4:The scheme of the transition radiation of the electron passing through a plain mirror;

~Ecis the Coulomb electric ﬁeld strength lines of the electron; arrows near vectors ~Er show the
directions of the electric ﬁeld strength lines of the radiation propagating in the spherical layer.

It follows from the equations (19)-(21) that total radiation increases slowly with the relativistic factor
ln γ). A marked part of the emitted radiation is emitted outside of the peak θ > √3/γ. The
γ (
energy of the transition radiation in the region γ

1/θ1 does not depend on γ.

∼

Uniformly moving particle does not emit radiation. But such particle in ultrarelativistic case
produce electric and magnetic ﬁelds, which have mainly transverse components of electric and magnetic
ﬁelds (lines of force are compressed in the transverse direction). This ﬁelds obviously will interact
with matter the same way as the real wavepackets of the electromagnetic waves of the same time
dependence of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds at the observation point. One speaks that the Coulomb
ﬁelds of particles present the virtual photons (quanta). Virtual photons can be considered as real
photons moving parallel to the electron velocity. They can excite or ionize atoms and molecules or
can be reﬂected from the mirror when electron pass by the mirror.

≫

If the relativistic electron hit the mirror of ﬁnite dimensions and is stopped in it then in the ﬁrst
approximation the virtual photons which are outside the mirror dimensions will be emitted in the

14

direction of the initial electron velocity and the other virtual photons will be reﬂected from the mirror
in the opposite direction. The properties of the virtual photons are presented in the Appendix 2.

If the electron pass through the mirror of ﬁnite dimensions far from the edge of the mirror then
the interference of the transition radiation emitted from the both sides of the mirror and diﬀraction
radiation will occur at the observation point. This interference can be essential in the long wavelength
region. The total energy of the transition radiation weekly depend on the form and dimensions of the
mirror and depends mainly on the energy of the emerged spherical layers. The form of the mirror
have inﬂuence on the distribution of the transition radiation. For example, the transition radiation
will be focused by the concave mirror [13].

Notice that the expression (17) was calculated by using the image method. In this case the problem
was solved exactly. At the same time we can consider this problem in the framework of virtual photons
[2]. In this case we can say that the relativistic electron brings the compressed in the longitudinal
direction electromagnetic ﬁeld in the form of a wavepacket and this ﬁeld will be reﬂected from the
mirror after the electron will disappear in it. This is the approximate method [2]. That is why the
expressions (21) and (37) are slightly diﬀer. Moreover the transition radiation originate from one
point of the mirror surface and propagate in the form of thin spherical layer with sharp boundaries
(in the case of the mirror with the inﬁnite conductivity the thickness of the layer will be zero) as we
discussed above using exact image method. The solution obtained by the approximate method of the
virtual photons in any case lead to the plane (not spherical) reﬂected wavepackets of ﬁnite thickness
which at the mirror surface have the electric ﬁeld strengths with time dependence of the form which
repeat the form of the Coulomb ﬁelds of the electron.

As we mentioned the transition radiation problem is equivalent to the instantaneous ﬁnish at
(instantaneous start from) the point of input (output) of the particle and its image on the mirror
surface. For the ideal mirror the emitted radiation is the strange radiation and for the real mirror is
the conventionally strange radiation (after strange wavepacket a week but long wavepacket of opposite
polarity with the same strange parameter appear) because in the last case the waves will be emitted
by electrons of the mirror but this electrons will be at rest both before and after transition of the
projectile particle the mirror (real mirrors have ﬁnite conductivity) [3], [4], [12]. Notice that the ﬁnite
dimensions and conductivity of the mirror will lead to decreasing of the long wavelength and short
wavelength radiation accordingly.

5.2 The transition radiation of particles crossing a series of two developed at the

angle 45o mirrors.

In the Fig.5 a scheme of the transition radiation source based on the system of two developed at the
angle 45o mirrors is presented [14], [15]. The particle come out of the mirror M 1 at the point A
with the velocity v moves along the axis y and strike the mirror M 2 at the point O. At the point
of observation D the radiation will be received directly both from the point A and from the point
O. There are many other ways for the propagation of the radiation emitted in the points A and O
which lead to the observation point D after many reﬂections between mirrors M 1 and M 2. Further
we will consider the case when the distances RAD, ROD between the observation point D and mirror’s
points A, O is of the order of the distance RAO between points A and O. In this case we will neglect
the radiation emitted in the point A and propagated to the point D under the sharp angle. We will
neglect the radiation emitted in the points A and O and reﬂected by mirrors M 1 and M 2 when this
radiation propagate to the point D at sharp angles as well. We will select only the radiation which
propagate to the observation point D along the axis x and at small angles to this axis.

Using the image method we can say that at the observation point D the next wavepackets of such
kind will be received. The ﬁrst wavepacket will be presented by the radiation emitted from the point

radiation emitted by charge in the point O in the direction opposite to it’s velocity and reﬂected
successively by the mirrors M 1 and M 2).

It follows from (22) that at the distances between the emission points A and O of the order of the

distance between the point O and the observation point D or higher (RAO ≥
spectrum of the radiation accepted by the observer will be determined in the main by the radiation
emitted at the point O. In this geometry the long wavelength radiation at the observation point will
be presented in the highest degree. The using of the concave mirror at this position will permit to
select the radiation in points A and O and to keep the long wavelength radiation at high level. Such
conditions probably took place in the experiments [15].

At large distances ROD ≫

The multiple sin2[ω/ωc(θ)] in (23) appeared as the result of the interference of two strange waves
with opposite strange parameters (the wave of the transition radiation emitted at the point A change
the direction of the electric ﬁeld strength after the reﬂection from the mirror M2). The interference
does not change the total energy of the radiation emitted in the given direction (and over all directions
ωco will lead to double value of (17)
as well) since the integration of (23) over ω from 0 to ω
(< sin2[ω/ωc(θ)] >= 1/2. The interference only redistribute the emitted energy over the spectrum.
In this case and usually in many other cases when a system of similar mirrors placed in series and
developed at large angles is used such redistribution lead to the exhaustion of the emitted radiation in
the long wavelength region and the problem arises to select the emitted wavepackets by lenses, holes
and so on in order to destroy the interference of the wavepackets of the opposite polarity at large
distances [3], [4].

We can see that at large distances the emitted wavepackets will not be overlapped. The vector
of the electric ﬁeld strength of the radiation emitted by electron will be directed backward to the
hour-hand in the upper right part of the Fig.6 and in the opposite direction in the lower right one.
All emitted transition radiation (twice of the value (21)) will be extracted from the inner part of the
system of mirrors (if we neglect the absorption of this radiation in the mirrors). The spectral-angular
distribution of the emitted radiation can be described by the expressions (17)-(21) because of the
interference between the extracted portions of radiation is absent. This conclusion will be valid for
the wavelengths λ

spectrum is determined by the spectral-angular distribution of the transition radiation (17) emitted
from the surface of one mirror. At given direction the spectral-angular and spectral distributions of
the emitted energy are increased with the number of mirrors by the low M 2 and M respectively.

Notice that the energy produced by a particle in the system of mirrors is a maximum energy
permitted for the transition radiation. It corresponds to the case when the particle fall on the every
mirror of the system as if it was coming from the inﬁnity. In this case all virtual photons (see (17)-(21),
Appendix 2) will be reﬂected from the both sides of the mirrors (in the region of frequencies where

the mirrors reﬂection coeﬃcient is high). The mirrors in this case can be done from thin (
Aluminum foil transparent for the electron beam.

The broadband radiation is possible in a similar system if we will use the system of mirrors arranged

at diﬀerent (irregular) distances.

The transition radiation sources considered above can be based on the linear accelerators.
In the case of Smith-Purcell radiation the relativistic particle is moving along a row of mirrors at
some distance a from them. In this case only small part of Coulomb ﬁelds of the particle (virtual
photons) will enter the gap between mirrors (to the length
λu) and will be converted in the real
photons. The energy of the Smith-Purcell radiation of one particle will be much less then the energy
of the transition radiation shown in the Fig.7. The electron beam in this case will not be disturbed by
the mirrors and hence such system in principle can be installed in the straight section of the storage
ring. A system of mirrors with hole of radius a arranged in the form of Fig.7 can be used as well.

We have investigated the case of the particle radiation in a system of plane parallel circular mirrors.
Another systems can be used. For example a system of the rectangular waveguides closed from one side
and opened from another side will permit to make more compact source of radiation. The electron
beam will penetrate these waveguides in turn in the direction perpendicular to theirs walls. The
radiation from the opened sides of the waveguides can be gathered by a long plane mirror. Another
example can be a system of pairs of small plane mirrors turned at the angle 45o like in Fig.5 with
separation lenses and a long plane mirror to gather the emitted radiation.

5.4 Stimulated transition radiation.

If the system of two parallel circular mirrors shown on the Fig.6 will be closed by a cylinder mirror
then the transition radiation emitted on the mirrors M 1 and M 2 will be reﬂected by the cylinder
mirror and will be returned to the central region of the system with the longitudinal component of the
electric ﬁeld strength. Closed cylindrical cavity (resonator) will be formed. Such cavity can be exited

20

by a train of bunches to high value electric ﬁeld strength and high power can be extracted from this
cavity through a special hole or semitransparent window.

Usually at the center of such cavity a hole is produced for the electron beam. The quality of the
cavity with a hole is high for the wavelengths much higher then the diameter of the hole. A system of
such cavities in the form of the iris-loaded waveguide is used as well.

In closed resonators the inﬁnitely high amount of the longitudinal modes exist. They can be exited
by the electron beam with high eﬃciency if the electron bunches of the beam will enter the resonator
in the decelerating phases and if the wavelengths of these modes of the order of the electron bunch
length and higher. Such resonator systems will emit electromagnetic radiation with line spectrum.

6 The long wavelength sources based on the storage rings.

In the Fig.8 a principle scheme of an electromagnetic source based on a storage ring is presented.
The storage ring includes 4 banding magnets and straight sections. Modern storage rings have more
complicated magnetic structure and can include many banding magnets quadrupole lenses and another
control systems.

BM are the banding magnets, SS are the straight sections of the

In all storage rings the main part of the energy is emitted from the banding magnets in the form
of synchrotron radiation propagates in a small vertical range of the angles and in near 2π horizontal
range of angles. Only in a small (
10/γ) horizontal range of angles near the direction of the axis of the
straight section the emitted radiation will have the properties which are diﬀer from the properties of
the synchrotron radiation [4]. Insertion devices can be installed in the straight sections of the storage
rings to increase the intensity to shift the hardness to change the shape of the spectrum and to tune
the polarization of the emitted radiation. Usually such devices are the undulators of diﬀerent types
[16], [17] or diﬀerent banding magnets creating some desirable shapes of the magnetic ﬁeld along the
axes of the straight sections of the storage rings [4].

In the case of limited particle trajectories with straight sections which takes place in the storage
rings the spectrum of radiation emitted in the directions near to the direction of the axis of a straight
section (under the angles
1/γ to this direction) is shifted in the long wavelength region. The value
of this shift can be increased at low frequencies by using optical lenses, concave mirrors and other
elements to select light emitted from the end part of the electron trajectory in the banding magnet
[3], [4]. Preliminary experiments conﬁrmed the possibility of such selection of the radiation emitted
by electrons in the fringed ﬁelds of the synchrotrons and storage rings [18]

The spectral-angular density of the energy of the electromagnetic radiation emitted in these di-
rections at the wavelengths λ
λl can be increased if three banding magnets will be installed in the
straight section of the storage ring. First and third banding magnets must have half of the optimal
magnetic ﬁelds (11) and second banding magnet must have the optimal magnetic ﬁeld of the opposite
polarity. Linear polarized radiation will be emitted from such system. Three bending magnets of such
conﬁguration does not disturb the electron orbits in the storage ring at arbitrary magnetic ﬁelds when
the ratio 1/2 is fulﬁlled. The increasing of the value of the magnetic ﬁeld strengths in such system
to the values much higher then optimal will lead to the case of enhanced synchrotron radiation if the
value of the magnetic ﬁeld strengths in the magnets will be less then the value of the magnetic ﬁeld
strength in the bending magnets of the storage ring [19], [20], [21].

The circular polarized long wavelength radiation in such geometry can be realized when two triplet
systems of such kind will be used. The direction of the magnetic ﬁeld of the second triplet must be
perpendicular to the direction of the ﬁrst one and the second triplet must be shifted on the distance
of a half distance between the ﬁrst and second magnets of the ﬁrst triplet [4].

7 On the choice of the scheme of the long wavelength broadband

source of coherent radiation

The problem of the choice of the optimal scheme of the electromagnetic radiation source based on the
electron beams is determined by the real conditions. If you need some source and have no accelerator
then you will have one solution. If you need the same source and have one ore more accelerators then
you can choose another decision of the problem.

The accelerator is the most expensive and large part of the sources. If you have accelerator then
you will try to adapt it to the solution of the source problem. Your existing accelerators probably were
used and are used now in other ﬁelds of science or technology. Their parameters like electron beam
energy, current, transverse and longitudinal dimensions, angular and energy spreads (emittances) can
be far from optimal ones for the solution of your problem. Nevertheless the non-optimal solution with
non-brelliant parameters can suit you.

At present the optimal solution of the problem of the electromagnetic radiation sources based

monochromaticity, directivity and so on.

−

If you need high power, high brightness source of the quasi-monochromatic optical to hard X-Ray
Ray) regions then you ought to use the undulator radiation sources based on the storage rings
(soft γ
[11], [23]. If you need high average intensity source of continuous hard quasi-monochromatic γ
Rays
with tuned polarization then you ought to use the backward Compton scattering source based on a
laser and on a storage ring. Backward Rayleigh scattering source can be used in future when the
storage rings with relativistic ions (like LHC, RHIC) will appear [24].

−

If you need high power monochromatic source of coherent radiation in mm-to vacuum ultraviolet
regions you ought to use prebunched or ordinary (with self-bunching) free-electron lasers based on
storage rings and linear accelerators.

The spontaneous incoherent undulator radiation sources and free-electron lasers use undulators.
Undulators are the devices which force the particles to move along the periodical trajectory (sine, helix
and so on). The properties of the radiation are determined by the trajectory. The same trajectories can
be produced by diﬀerent undulators. For example electrons are moving along the helical trajectories
in homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, in helical undulator, in the ﬁeld of the electromagnetic wave and
so on. Crystals can be considered as a natural undulators. Undulators based on the magnets and
electromagnetic waves of lasers does not disturb the electron beam and are used in the sources in
mm-to γ

ray regions.

If you need the broadband source of the optical to X-Ray regions then you can use the synchrotron
radiation [25] source or the undulator radiation source based on the undulator forming the magnetic
ﬁeld by a deﬁnite low [16] or the system of magnets with alternating polarity irregular arranged along
some axis. Usually the intensity of the spontaneous incoherent radiation of such sources is enough for
users.

If you need the broadband or the quasi-monochromatic source of the γ

ray regions then you
can use the breamsstrahlung radiation produced by the electron beams in the amorphous media and
coherent breamsstrahlung or channeling radiation in crystals.

−

−

The intensity of the broadband sources is decreased with the increasing of the emitted wavelength.
The problem of the long wavelength high intensity broadband sources appear. This problem is ag-
gravated by the condition of the broadband sources which means that you can not use the coherent
radiation of the microbunches arranged on short distances. The distance between microbunches must
be much larger then the length of the wavepackets emitted by one microbunch in the magnet sys-
tem because the overlapping of the broadband wavepackets can lead to the decreasing of the emitted
energy (in the case of the undulator radiation sources the distance between microbunches can be λ
that is K times shorter, then the length of the wavepackets, electric ﬁeld strength of the wavepackets

23

overlapped in phase can be K times higher and the intensity K 2 times higher). The using of the
periodical train of the electron bunches will lead to the line structure of the emitted spectra (see (7)).
Only the coherent radiation of the individual arranged at large distances bunches is possible in this
case. Some schemes of such kind were considered in this paper. Non periodical train of the electron
bunches can permit to decrease the average distance between electron bunches and this way to help
to push forward the problem under the consideration.

The ability of some schemes of the particle radiation in external ﬁelds and in media are presented in
the Appendix 3. We can see that the most eﬃcient schemes of the broadband particle radiation sources
in mm-to soft IR region could be sources based on Cherenkov radiation in the transparent media and
on the transition radiation system based on a system of parallel mirrors (Fig.7). Unfortunately the
transparent media will be ionized and destroyed by the electron beam and the electron beam in turn
will be disturbed by scattering process in media. That is why the Cherenkov radiation schemes are not
used in the sources under consideration. The transition radiation sources using thin metal foils can be
based on linear accelerators. Using the transparent media and mirrors with holes does not solve this
problem as sources based on such systems permit generate eﬀectively the electromagnetic radiation
on the wavelengths of the order of the aperture of such holes and longer. The spectral intensity of the
radiation emitted at a given frequency in this case does not depend on the electron energy and only
lead to the extension of the bandwidth of the emitted radiation. The most eﬃcient scheme of the long
wavelength and broadband source of coherent radiation apparently is the scheme of the prebunched
free-electron laser based on an undulator and on an opened resonator.

8 Conclusion.

Diﬀerent schemes of the broadband sources of coherent radiation in the millimeter and shorter wave-
length regions based on bunched particle beams were considered in this paper. The most eﬃcient
scheme of such source is apparently the prebunched free-electron laser based on an undulator and on
an opened resonator.

In order to produce the long wavelength radiation in these regions on high energy accelerators (
∼
100 MeV) the long period undulators with high deﬂecting parameters can be used. In order to generate
the broadband radiation it is necessary to use two or several banding magnets of the alternating
polarity with high deﬂecting parameters and placed on diﬀerent distances one after another (to break
the periodicity).

Notice that the prebunched free-electron lasers based on undulators or similar systems and opened
resonators have an important feature. The emitted energy in such lasers is extracted from a hole of
small diameter (much smaller then the mirror diameter). It will lead to the increased brightness of
such sources.

The authors thanks Professor M.Ikezawa for the formulation of the problem of the powerful long

wavelength sources of the continuous broadband radiation and for helpful discussions.

To compare the ability of diﬀerent schemes of the particle radiation in external ﬁelds and in media
below we will present spectral-angular density of photons ∂2Nγ/∂ω∂o = (1/¯hω)(∂2ε/∂ω∂o) in an
electromagnetic wave emitted by one particle in the corresponding ﬁelds or media. The coherent
radiation of the particle bunches can be calculated by introducing the coherence factor which is near
the same for all of these schemes and hence the comparison will be valid for the coherent radiation
sources as well.

the axis z. Then the electron is deﬂected by a magnet at the angle 2α in the xz plane and go out with

In this case the spectral-angular density of photons is determined by expressions (4), (6). It takes

5. An electron emit transition radiation when crossing the plain mirror.
In this case the spectral-angular density of photons and the total number of photons emitted in

the relative range of frequencies ∆ω/ω is determined by expressions (17), (21)

The using a system of two or M > 2 plane mirrors will permit to reach 2M times more high values

of the spectral-angular density and total number of the emitted photons (see section 5.3).
6. An electron emit Cherenkov radiation when it pass through the transparent media.
The spectral distribution of the Cherenkov radiation emitted by an electron in a media and the
total number of photons emitted in the relative range of frequencies ∆ω/ω are determined by the
expressions [2].

Abstract

The TexSol
is a composite geomaterial : a sand matrix and a wire network re-
inforcement. For small strains a thermodynamical continuous model of the TexSol
including the unilaterality of the wire network is postulated. This model is described
by two potentials which depend on some internal variables and a state variable either
strain or stress tensor (the choice of this last one gives two diﬀerent ways of identi-
ﬁcation). The TexSol continuous model is implemented in a ﬁnite element code to
recover the mechanical behaviour given by discrete elements numerical experiments.

Key words: geomaterial, wire, unilaterality, continuous, thermodynamics, numeric

1 Motivations

1.1 What is the TexSol ?

The civil pieces of work need planed stable ﬂoor. The environment conﬁgura-
tion often forces civil engineers to raise huge embankments. Moreover, it can
be interesting to reinforce them to assure a better embankment mechanical
behaviour. A lot of diﬀerent solutions can be used to reinforce soil but, in this
paper, we focus our attention to the TexSol process.

The TexSol, created in 1984 by Leﬂaive Khay and Blivet from LCPC (Labo-
ratoire Central des Ponts et Chauss´ees) [12], is a heterogeneous material by

mixing sand and wire network. This reinforced material has a better mechan-
ical resistance than the sand without wire. Of course, the TexSol behaviour
depends on sand and wire parameters and its frictional angle can be larger
than the sand one from 0◦ to 10◦ [8]. The wire is described by its linear den-
1), its ponderal content and its
sity with a dtex unit (1 dtex = 0, 1 g.km−
stiﬀness. Classically, the wire density in a TexSol sample is included between
100 km.m−

3 and 200 km.m−

3.

To make a TexSol bank, a machine named “Texsoleuse” is used. It works on
throwing sand and, in the same time, injecting wire. The wire is deposed on
the free plane of the sand with a random orientation. This machine carries
out several passes to raise the bank. The ﬁgure 1 is the TexSol microstructure
representation. In the literature, we ﬁnd two diﬀerent continuous modellings.

Fig. 1. Schematic TexSol sections

The model suggested in [5] is non local and includes remote interactions (cor-
responding to the wire eﬀects) but also needs an identiﬁcation of their param-
eters using macroscopic experiments. Villard proposes a simpler local model
in [20]. This one couples a standard model of sand and an equivalent unilat-
eral elastic stiﬀness contribution corresponding to the wire network. This last
contribution is activated only on the traction directions because of the unilat-
eral behaviour of wire. Our ﬁrst work is to clearly deﬁne thermo-dynamical
potentials of the Villard local model with both stress and strain formulations
to identify the best-adapted one.

1.2 Assumptions of the continuous local model

To couple the elastic plastic model of the sand and the unilateral elastic model
of the wire network, we have to consider some mechanical assumptions, which
may be backed up by numerical experiments performed with a discrete ele-
ments software [3,15].

2

1.2.1 Stress additivity assumption

In this paper, the stress additivity assumption of the sand and the wire network
is assumed. Then we write,

σs + σw = σ ,

(1)

where σs, σw and σ are respectively the stress second order tensor of the
sand, the wire network and the TexSol.

This assumption seems to be coherent with the TexSol quasi-static behaviour.
We can get a good approximation of the stress tensor in numerical simulation
of 2D granular matter [16] using the Weber stress tensor [1]. This tensor
may be non symmetrical if inertial eﬀects are not negligeable. For quasi-static
processes this discrete tensor is a good candidate to represent a continuous
stress tensor. Moreover we can deﬁne such a tensor grain by grain with the
Moreau approach [15]. In this way a wire network stress and a sand stress may
be computed, to recover by addition the full TexSol stress (in the simulation,
the wire is modeled by a chain of beads with unilateral interactions [11]).
On a biaxial crushing test we verify the symmetry property even for large
deformation as long as the process remains slow.

The eigenvalues (EV1, EV2) are computed and the contribution of each com-
ponent of the TexSol are underlined in the ﬁgure 2 where the wire network is
only in a tensile state ; in the two eigen directions the sand is in compression.
This may be also observed on the distribution of force network in the granular
sample.

1.2.2 Non sliding assumption

This second assumption is not as evident as the previous one. Although micro
slidings occur between sand grains and wire, we assume that at the macro-
scopic level of the continuum model, the sand network does not slip through
the wire network. This assumption can be translated by the equality of the
three strain rates,

·
εs =

·
εw =

·
ε ,

(2)

where εs, εw and ε are respectively the strain second order tensor of the sand,
the wire network and the TexSol.

We have to be very careful with such a condition and deﬁne some validity
domains for it. Indeed the limits of this assumption are diﬃcult to quantify
and we will restrict the validation of the following continuum model to small
strains.

1.3 Role of the wire unilaterality

The wire network contributes to the tensile srtength of the composite mate-
rial but not to the compression one (cf. ﬁgure 2). To model such a behaviour
at the macroscopic scale, it is convenient to introduce a unilateral condition
in the behaviour law of the wire network. This unilaterality accounts for two
microscopic phenomena. The ﬁrst one is the lack of bending strength of the
wire network viewed as a piece of cotton. The second one is the local buckling
of short segments. The ﬁrst aspect is not explicitely taken into account by a
unilateral condition at the microscopic scale in our discrete numerical simula-
tion since the chain of beads has no bending strength. The second aspect may
be enforced by introducing a unilateral interaction law between two successive
beads. Such an interaction models an elemental wire between two beads : we
denote by “rigid wire”; if not we speak about “rigid rod” (cf. ﬁgure 4) for
bilateral law between beads. The ﬁgure 3 illustrates the diﬀerence of global
behaviour between both simulation for crushing biaxial test. Until 6 percents
of deformation, the responses are almost identical. For larger deformation the
“rigid rod” model leads to a rough increase of rigidity due to the appearance of

compression columns in the wire. Such a phenomenon seems not very realistic
and is probably issued from a scale eﬀect since the numerical sample is not
representative enough of the material. In particular the model of wire with a
chain of beads generates non realistic wedges of beads by sand grains.

1.4 Why a strain and stress formulation ?

In this paper, we propose to carry out a thermodynamical study with both
strain and stress formulations. The interest of this work is in the identiﬁcation
possibilities of potentials parameters. Indeed, an experimentator making some
tests on a sample has only access to the global strain. Our numerical inves-
tigations allow us to have access to ﬁner data such as the local stress ﬁeld
throughout the sample. Moreover the global stress tensor over the sample can
be deduced by an average.

1.2.1 provides
The post processing of numerical experiments mentioned in
§
precise informations on the stress ﬁelds, in the sand and in the wire network.
The stress “unilaterality” in the wire is clearly established in the ﬁgure 2. This

5

observation could lead us to favour a stress formulation. But the ﬁnite element
softwares are essentially developed using a strain formulation. Consequently
we propose, in the following study, strain formulations easily implementable.
Dual stress formulations are provided when they can be analytically deduced
by the Legendre – Fenchel transformation.

2 A general thermodynamical framework

In this part, we deﬁne potentials written with diﬀerent state variables. These
potentials have to check the Clausius–Duhem inequality to be thermodynam-
ically admissible.

2.1 Strain versus stress approach in thermodynamics

This work must be as exhaustive as possible, while passing from unspeciﬁed
state variables to its dual. We thus use the Legendre–Fenchel transformation
[14], to carry out our study with both strain and stress formulations. Let us
write the Clausius–Duhem inequality where u is the internal energy, s the
entropy, q the heat ﬂow and T the temperature,

The intrinsic dissipation depends on a state variable X (or its dual X ∗),
some internal variables α =

(each internal variable can be scalar,
vectorial or tensorial) and the temperature T . It can also be expressed with
the free energy ψ or its Legendre–Fenchel transformation ψ∗ with respect to
the state variable X,

subdiﬀerentials instead of derivatives. If convexity is not required, previous
relations still hold using the Clarke subdiﬀerential [2]. Then the primal and
dual forms are not necessary equivalent. In the general case, the Clausius–
Duhem inequality (4) or (5) can be reduced to a dot product of a vector ﬂow

The ﬂow variables have to be related by evolution laws to the force variables.
To verify the inequality (7) some assumptions may be added to these relations.
It is convenient to introduce a dissipation potential ϕ from which the evolution
laws are derived. By duality a force function ϕ∗ is automatically deﬁned using
the Legendre–Fenchel transformation,

Similar properties are required for ϕ∗ to recover the Clausius–Duhem inequal-
ity. Generally we distinguish the reversible and irreversible parts of the trans-
formation. We thus postulate an additive decomposition for both reversible
and irreversible parts of the strain tensor ε = εr + εir and the stress tensor
σ = σr + σir. The reversible / irreversible splitting of σ is less classical. To
illustrate its interest, remark that eventual residual stresses may be accounted
for in the irreversible part.

≥

At this stage we have to choose the external state variable X for the strain
formulation and consequently X ∗ for the stress formulation. It is usual to
consider for X the total strain tensor ε. By the way the reversible stress σr
appears in the state law and becomes the state variable in the dual stress
formulation. But we can also use the reversible strain part εr and deduce the
full stress tensor σ as the dual state variable (cf. table 1). The ﬁrst column
expresses the primal model using εr or ε as state variable. The second one
provides the corresponding dual formulations.

2.2 1D model of reinforced geomaterial

Let us apply previous results to a rheological 1D model of TexSol taking into
account the wire unilaterality.

2.2.1 Strain formulation

We choose to superpose a classical 1D model of elasto-plasticity with hardening
for sand [13] and a 1D unilateral model of elasticity for wire. We thus propose

3 Strain and stress approach for 3D models

The complex microstructure of the TexSol material needs not to neglect the
three dimensional eﬀects. To deﬁne a 3D model we follow the previous 1D
approach superposing a classical elastic plastic behaviour for the sand and a
unilateral elastic one for the wire network. Simple and sophisticated unilater-
ality conditions may be considered leading to diﬀerent formulations more or
less easy to handle in a general primal / dual framework.

3.1 3D thermodynamical potentials of the sand

First of all, let us recall that the stress tensor can be split into a spherical part
and a deviatoric one,

Let us introduce the spherical projection tensor S = 1
3 I
I and the deviatoric
⊗
projection tensor D = I− S. In a classical model the state variable is the sand
full strain εs, the internal ones contain the plastic strain εp
s, the kinematic and
isotropic hardening variables α and p [21]. The free energy ψs has the following

Contrary to the 1D case, we cannot explicitely express a 3D dissipation po-
tential depending on ﬂow variables.

3.2 Unilateral wire network model

According to the 1D model, we neglect the dissipation eﬀects, and we focus on
the free energy. Its stiﬀness cannot be reduced to the stiﬀness of the wire and
has to account for the wire distribution in the sample, assumed to be isotropic
in the following. Due to the entanglement of the wire network, it is convenient
to consider continuously diﬀerentiable free energy to derive smooth relations
between strain and stress at the macroscopic level. A model directly derived
from the isotropic linear elasticity may be expressed in the eigen directions ;
the strain and stress tensors have the same ones. Consequently the free energy
is simply written using the Lam´e coeﬃcients λw, µw and the strain eigen
values denoted ε1

The ﬁrst term describes the volumic unilateral behaviour of the wire network
activated by the trace of the strain. The second part concerns the shear com-
ponent which is not activated in all directions simultaneously but according to
the sign of the strain eigen values. The stress expressed in the eigen directions
is easily derived from this previous energy,

question in the general case but it is easily veriﬁed for µw = 0 because the
trace is a linear operator.

3.3 Models superposition and TexSol potentials

The previous model is combined according to the 1D approach. Moreover,
we introduce two eventual initial stresses σ0
s. There are generated
by the deposit process under gravity which may be simulated by a discrete
element software [3,15]. Then we can reasonably assume that eigen values of
σ0
w are non negatives. We deﬁne the corresponding the initial strains using the
elastic parts of the previous models, ε0
s, where
Kw = λwI

I + 2µw I. The total free energy is then postulated,

4 Numerical development

Starting from a coherent thermodynamical model for the TexSol, the next step
consists in implementing it in a ﬁnite element software [7,9]. We discuss then
responses provided by the simulation of simple compression / traction tests
according to the expected behaviours detailed in section 1.

4.1 Numerical implementation

The variables being known at step n
1, we have to compute them at step
−
n using a predicted value of the strain increment ∆εn. In a sake of simplic-
ity, the initial stresses are neglected (σ0
w = 0). Two sets of variables,
(σs,n, χn, pn) for the sand and (σw,n) for the wire network, are computed si-
multaneously. The stress in the wire network is directly deduced from the
potential deﬁned by (19). For the sand the relations given in (14), (17) and
(18) can be reduced to three equations depending on the three unknowns
(σs,n, χn, pn). This system is solved by a Newton – Raphson method applied
to the following residuals Qα

4.2 Patch test

In a ﬁrst step, the simple patch test considered is a single Q1-Lagrange hexahe-
dron ﬁnite element submitted to a traction/compression loading (cf. ﬁgure 6).
More precisely, a conﬁnement pressure is prescribed via a cohesion behaviour
on the material [17] depending on a single coeﬃcient C0. A displacement is
imposed on the upperside. Four models are compared to underline the per-
tinency of the two unilateral behaviour laws. Two of them are considered to
obtain some limit behaviours ; the ﬁrst one denoted Sand, is free of wire ;
the second one denoted Reinforced sand, is a superposition of a sand model
and an elastic “bilateral” model of the reinforcement. The “unilateral” TexSol
3.3 is denoted Texsol. A particular model is added denoted
model referred to

Fig. 7. Zoom on the elastic range of the models

The Sand and the Reinforced sand appear clearly as two elastic bounds for
TexSol models (cf. ﬁgure 7). At this stage, the Spherical Texsol does not
diﬀer from the Sand. On the contrary, the Texsol
is close to the Sand in
compression and close to the Reinforced sand in traction. For the two loadings
the limit models reveal to be the upper bounds. For a loading-unloading
traction process, the Texsol model behaves almost like the Reinforced sand as
expected (cf. ﬁgure 8). The Spherical Texsol does not improve signiﬁcantly the
Sand (cf. ﬁgure 8 and 9). Consequently, the Spherical Texsol does not account
for the numerical results given in the ﬁgure 3 for the same kind of experiment
- even roughly.

4.3 Cyclic loading

TexSol embankments may be submitted to vibrating solicitations. A cyclic
test based on the test represented in the ﬁgure 10 (where the displacements
are ﬁxed on the lower side and the sollicitation managed by force) is performed

to underline the contribution of the “unilateral” reinforcement due to the wire
network. Some material parameters are changed to apply a greater amplitude
of loading on it : C0 = 150 MPa, θf = 0.02, Hk = 5 MPa, Hi = 1 MPa.
Reinforced sand, Texsol and Sand are compared in the ﬁgures 11, 12 and 13.
For the three models, the response tends to be stabilized after 20 cycles.
But for Reinforced sand and Texsol the stabilization is reached before 10
loops. Moreover the residual displacement of Texsol is 30 percents bigger than
that of Reinforced sand and ﬁve times smaller than that of Sand. This last
result highlights the advantages of TexSol reinforcement. An other eﬀect of
the “unilateral” wire in the Texsol model is clearly illustrated by the curvature
changes when the displacement switches sign in the ﬁgure 12.

4.4 Compression test

In soil mechanics it is usual to carry out a triaxial test with a prescribed
conﬁnement pressure (cf. ﬁg 14). Considering the previous numerical results
4.2, the Spherical Texsol model is no more studied. Only the three
of the
§
other cases are compared in a loading compression test (the bulk mesh is
described in [10]). The contribution of the wire in TexSol to the mechanical

Fig. 14. Compression test

strenght is illustrated by the spacial distribution of two stresses : the full stress
σ and the wire stress σw. The distribution of the full stress is identical in the
three models with a level for Texsol between the two others. The main part of
stress is located in the center of the bulk expect a localized concentration on
the right lower corner. The contribution of the wire in the stress tensor (σw)
is split into its deviatoric part and its spherical one (pressure). Both parts
are identically null for Sand (cf. ﬁgure 16c and 17c). The elasticity of the
reinforcement is activated only in tensile directions for the Texsol and in all
directions for the Reinforced sand ; this explains the diﬀerent full stress levels

21

Fig. 15. Equivalent Von-Mises stress

Fig. 16. Wire equivalent Von-Mises stress

in the ﬁgure 15 and the diﬀerent wire stress levels in the ﬁgure 16. The nature

of the reinforcement due to the wire is clearly illustrated in the ﬁgure 17. The
wire pressure in the Sand sample is of course identically null. It is negative in
the Texsol wire (traction behaviour) according to the unilaterality condition
expressed in the equation (20) whereas the pressure in the reinforcement of
the Reinforced sand is almost everywhere positive.

5 Conclusion and prospects

In this paper a coherent thermodynamical model is proposed to account for
numerical experiments (because of the lack of real experiments on the TexSol ).
The keypoint is a “unilateral” elasticity which model the wire network. An
elastic plastic model is superposed to the previous one to obtain both strain
formulation and stress formulation when it is possible. Using a ﬁnite element
method, we roughly validate the expected behaviour.

The main perspective of this work is the identiﬁcation of the mechanical
parameters of the superposed model by series of numerical experiments in
progress. In a more general framework orthotropic model is generally usefull
to model the wire network.

The free energy ψ considered in this work is postulated and in some cases we
can write the free enthalpy via the Legendre–Fenchel transformation. Another
approach should be to postulate the free enthalpy using a form similar to (19),

Gw =

νw
2Ew h

tr(σw)

2 +

σ≥w : σ≥w .

The link between Gw and ψ∗w is an open question because in a three dimen-
sional case the convexity of ψ cannot be proved.

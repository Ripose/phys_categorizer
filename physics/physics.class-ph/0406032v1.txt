We present a dynamical model describing a predictable human behavior like the tuning process
between singers. The purpose, inspired in physiological and behavioral grounds of human beings, is
sensitive to all Fourier spectrum of each sound emitted and it contemplates an asymmetric coupling
between individuals. We have recorded several tuning exercises and we have confronted the experi-
mental evidence with the results of the model ﬁnding a very well agreement between calculated and
experimental sonograms.

Introduction. When we think in music, we commonly
do it in relation to feelings and emotions arising from
the sub-cortical limbic system of the brain[1]. However,
music or sound perception is a very complex sequence of
transductions, beginning with the input of pressure waves
to the ear and ending with cognition operations devel-
oped in the brain’s external neocortex[2]. Consequently,
an overall understanding of what music means in human
beings requires physical, biological, neural, physiological
and behavioral grounds[3]. In this letter we are going to
focus on the tuning process between singers. The capabil-
ity of human beings to sing in tune is strongly dependent
on his natural conditions, training and previous experi-
ence. Then, results of tuning experiments can be very
diﬀerent even for the same initial conditions. To avoid
subjectivity we have restricted the possible solutions by
imparting a clear watchword oriented to achieve tuning
in the same note or in an octave. In this way we were
able to analyze experimentally basic human behavior and
consequently to propose a phenomenological mathemat-
ical model describing it. While there are many works
regarding synchronization[4, 5, 6, 7] (i. e. phase adjust)
this is, up to our knowledge, the ﬁrst model that account
for the evolution of spectra of frequencies interacting be-
tween them.

A musical note is a complex periodic oscillation that
can be discomposed into a sum of sinusoidal excitations,
the harmonics, each one with a frequency multiple of a
particular frequency called the fundamental. Then, if ω0
is the fundamental frequency, the Fourier spectrum of a
note is composed by peaks at ω0, 2ω0, 3ω0, etc. The
pitch indicates how high or low is a particular note and
is labeled with the value (or name) of the fundamental.
The relative intensities which each harmonic participate
in the sound deﬁne its timbre.[3]

A noise, in turn, is a sum of excitations without any
relationship between the individual frequencies although
the boundary between music and noise is subjective and
one can listen to musicality in a given noise or ﬁnd a
noisy musical sound. In the same way the idea of con-

sonance or dissonance is also a subjective, even cultural,
concept. Nevertheless there are physiological reasons to
understand the consonance: the medium ear contains a
conduct with variable transversal section, the cochlea, in-
side which a stationary wave is formed. From the hydro-
dynamical point of view, the cochlea is split-up in two
channels separated by the basilar membrane. The diﬀer-
ences in pressure at both sides of the membrane produce
deformations resulting in a resonance pattern detected by
a series of thin receptors, the hair cells, which are con-
nected to neurons[2]. Thus, the electrical signal sent to
the brain is in fact a transduction of the geometrical rep-
resentation of the deformation of the basilar membrane.
The set of nodes of the stationary wave is consistent with
only one note (i.e., with only one Fourier spectrum) and
then, two notes will be more consonant as more nodes in
common they have.[1] Mathematically, the consonance is
reﬂected in a simple ratio between the fundamental fre-
quencies of each note. For example, if ω10 and ω20 are the
fundamentals of two notes, a sequence from consonance
to dissonance is ω20/ω10 = 1, 2, 3/2, 4/3 etc. The inter-
vals between ω10 and ω20 are denominated the same note,
octave, ﬁfth, fourth, etc., respectively. For the purpose
of this work, we deﬁne tuning as the process in which
two or more sound emitters change their pitches in way
of equaling all or part of their Fourier spectra.

Looking for the model. In order to elaborate a mathe-
matical model which represents the main features of the
tuning process, we are going to extract basic ideas from
some well-known responses of the auditory system and
also from prototype experiments:

(i) The interaction term have to be a function which
goes to zero when the ratio between frequencies is a sim-
ple fraction. In this way, we cover the physiological and
mathematical grounds of consonance.

(ii) Two complex tones with the same Fourier family
but diﬀering only in that one of them has the fundamen-
tal missing, will be listened by the singer as the same
pitch. This ability of human beings was characterized
and explained through the concept of virtual pitch per-

ception introduced by E. Terhardt[8, 9]. We have ver-
iﬁed this response doing several experiments requesting
to the singer to tune a guitar’s sound which was sequen-
tially ﬁltered in its lower harmonics.
In consequence,
the functional response should be proportional to all the
spectrum more than a single frequency.

(iii) The point of subjectivity of ”how I listen to my
partner and how predisposed I am to interact with him”
can yields diﬀerent ﬁnal results of tuning exercises even
for the same couple of singers and with the same initial
condition. The model must contemplate this possibility.

(iv) Finally, and with the aim to deﬁne terminology,
it is useful to analyze a very simple tuning exercise: a
singer is asked to maintain his pitch while the partner
is moved until both are tuned. None of them know the
initial note of the other. The sonogram (temporal evo-
lution of the Fourier spectrum) of this exercise is shown
in Fig 1. At the beginning there is a brief interval of
about 0.2 s in which the singers locate their initial note
then, an period of approximately one second lapses, and
ﬁnally they eﬀectively start the exercise. We interpret
the ﬁrst interval as the necessary time to accommodate
the singing apparatus (vocal cords, resonators, air emis-
sion, etc.) to produce a musical sound. The time spent
in this action can be reduced with training. The second
stage is necessary to perform the cognitive operation to
listen to all the notes emitted and to take the decision to
move the pitch up or down to tune. The remaining time
is dedicated to feedback in order to achieve tuning. We
are going to name this last stage as dynamical tuning. In
the example of Fig. 1, and because the watchword im-
parted, one of them acts like if he does not listen to the
other. In other words, there is an asymmetric coupling
between them.

Keeping in mind these precepts, we propose the fol-
lowing set of equations describing the coupled dynamical
evolution of complex tones emitted by N singers:

N X

j

µ

KijIjµ sin (2mπ

), i = 1, ..., N.

ωjµ
ωi0

(1)
ωjµ is the frequency of the µth harmonic of the jth
individual within the group, Ijµ is the relative intensity
of the corresponding harmonic in the Fourier expansion
deﬁning the timbre of the sound, Kij is an oﬀ-diagonal
matrix (Kii = 0) representing the eﬀective relative mag-
nitude of the coupling between pairs of singers and m is
an integer constant.

The sine argument is the responsible to drive the stabil-
ity of the equations since when the relationship mωjµ/ωi0
is a integer, the temporal derivative goes to zero. This
sine function is indeed the key point of the model. The
condition for the roots works as the mathematical repre-
sentation of the natural behavior of singers to maximize
the coincidence of nodes in the resonance pattern of the
basilar membrane. In this sense, the goodness of the sine-
like interaction is independent of m since regardless the
particular value of m, this functional response ﬁts the
requirements of point (i). In a more general approach,
the set of Eqs. (1) should include a sum over m but, as
we are going to see later, the trends of the experimen-
tal records can be reproduced with only one family of
m−like functions.

The absolute magnitude of the coupling is given by all
the right side of Eq. 1 and the product K × I deﬁnes the
temporal scale of the process. A coupling proportional to
all Ijµ guarantees a response to the Fourier family more
than a frequency in particular [point (ii)]. Kij can be
thought in zero order approximation as a magnitude of
the volume of the emission, but as this matrix is asym-
metric in general (Kij 6= Kji), it can contemplate the
alternative that one of the singers emits always the same
pitch independently of the movement of the rest. Kij = 0
means ”the i-singer is not coupled with the j-singer” ei-
ther because he does not listen to the group or he has
decided not to change his pitch. By adopting diﬀerent
values for Kij we can obtain diﬀerent ﬁnal results for the
same pair of singers and starting with the same notes
respectively [point (iii)].

By construction, this model is oriented to describe the
dynamical tuning, i. e., when the singers start to move
their frequencies by interaction.

Results and Discussion. The individuals selected to all
the experiences were non-professional singers but most
of them have or had some training in collective singing.
We formed 24 pairs of singers and we recorded more
than one hundred experiences. The exercises were sim-
ple: ﬁrstly the initial note is indicated; each singer lis-
tens to only his own note. Then, they simultaneously

start and change their pitches until to ﬁnd tuning. The
watchword was ”to arrive to the same note” , which for
a medium-trained singer covers the possibility to tune in
an octave. This last alternative is more probable when
the separation between the initial pitches is large and/or
when we treat with a female-male couple. We have not
taken into account those records in which the watchword
was not properly understood. We also discarded records
in which one of the singer is near to the limit of his range.
The numerical resolution of the system of equa-
tions was done through an one step solver based on a
Dormand-Prince-Runge-Kutta formula[10] in which the
frequencies were assumed constants in the brief interval
corresponding to the discretization adopted (≃ 1 ms).
The numerical absolute error for the fundamental fre-
quencies was 10−5Hz. The initial values of fundamen-
tal frequencies and harmonic intensities were extracted
from an Fourier analysis of a small initial interval of the
experimental sonogram. Strictly, the harmonic intensi-
ties change with the frequency [I = I (ω)]. However this
ω−dependence is noticeable only when the pitch of the
sound emitted is close to the boundaries of the range (es-
pecially upper limit). Therefore, considering that most
of the exercises imply pitches in the medium region of the
range, we assume the harmonic intensities as constants
[I 6= I (ω)].

Figure 2 shows results for typical examples of tun-
ing exercises and its corresponding simulation. We have
drawn on left panel the experimental sonogram of the
dynamical tuning and on right panel the results of the
model given by Eqs. 1. Fig. 2a corresponds to a bari-
tone and a mezzo-soprano who start with relatively near
pitches (ω10 = 187 Hz and ω20 = 258 Hz) and after 2.5
s they converge in a common note of intermediate value
(ω = 219 Hz). Both experimental and theoretical results
show an asymmetric dynamical evolution of each spec-
trum in spite of the coupling is symmetric in this case
(K21/K12 = 1).
In Fig 2b the exercise for two tenors
is drawn, one of them practically maintaining (by own
decision) his pitch. Here we can observe as the initial in-
terval means a type of consonance since there is a coinci-
dence in harmonics of high order (ω20/ω10 = 220 Hz/185
Hz≃ 6/5) but as the instruction is to move towards to the
same note one of the singers changes his pitch up to lock
all the spectrum with the other. In this case we reproduce
the experimental evolution by adopting an asymmetric
coupling (K21/K12 = 25). Figure 2c is an example of a
tuning in an octave for a baritone-soprano couple. The
initial interval is a ﬁfth (ω20/ω10 = 272 Hz/181 Hz≃ 3/2)
and after the dynamical tuning they converge to an oc-
tave with fundamental frequency of ω10 = 146 Hz for
the baritone. In this example the ratio between eﬀective
couplings is K21/K12 = −1.
In all the cases the time
required for the dynamical tuning is about 1.5 s - 2 s in-
dependently of the training or the quality of the singer.
Theoretical results shown in Fig. 2 are very encourag-

records but it is worth to mention a word of caution. The
minus sign in the relation between eﬀective couplings of
the simulation presented in Fig. 2c seems to be non in-
tuitive. However it is not a conceptual barrier since in
this case we need that the fundamental frequencies go
away one of another in order to tune in an octave. So,

the minus sign changes the direction of the derivative fa-
cilitating the movement of fundamentals in the correct
sense. We remark that we have wanted to ﬁt the exper-
imental records with only one type of m−like functions.
In the context of this paper, the constant m works as a
degree of freedom of the model. In many cases -mainly
when there is not tuning at the same pitch- the model
with m = 1 is not able to reproduce the experimental
evidence although by ﬁxing m = 2 we recover a good
agreement. Clearly, the stability domains in the time
scale selected for the equation system change with m and
then it is necessary to analyze what is the proper value of
m for each case. This additional degree of freedom allow
us to explore other possible solutions. Figure 3 shows
an interesting situation in which we have changed the
watchword asking to the singers ”to arrive to a pleasant
sensation”. Here we can study what consonance means
for each couple since the watchword can be interpreted
in a more subjective fashion. The example shown in Fig.
3 is part of an exercise lasting 12 s approximately in
which the singers cross several stages of dynamical tun-
ing. The sequence was ﬁrstly a fourth and then three
diﬀerent ﬁfths, each one in a more comfortable sector
of their ranges. We selected the ﬁrst movement from a
fourth (ω20/ω10 = 420 Hz/319 Hz≃ 4/3) towards a ﬁfth
(ω20/ω10 = 425 Hz/283 Hz≃ 3/2). The record was re-
produced by taking K21/K12 = −0.15 and m = 2. We
notice that because his subjectivity the results emerging
from this second watchword were diverse and very singer-

1400

dependent and we not always reached a good simulation.

Conclusions. As a summary, in this work we propose
a model describing a particular and predictable human
behavior like the tuning process between singers. The
calculations were done taking as input parameters the ex-
perimental values of initial fundamental frequencies and
harmonic intensities. We were able to reproduce almost
exactly the dynamical evolution for several situations and
we believe that this model containing the main features of
the tuning process could be the starting point to further
investigations in this ﬁeld.

1 Introduction

It is well known that the theory on symplectic manifolds plays an important role in both
classical mechanics (see, for example, [1], [2]) and ﬁeld theory. On the other hand, both
Lagrange and Hamilton mechanics had been also well established.

Very recently, however, the Euler-Lagrange cohomology has ﬁrst been introduced and dis-
cussed in [3, 4] for classical mechanics and ﬁeld theory in order to explore the relevant topics
in the (independent variable(s)) discrete mechanics and ﬁeld theory including symplectic
and multisymplectic algorithms.

Based upon these works, we have further found that there is in fact a sequence of the par-
ticular cohomology groups called the Euler-Lagrange cohomology groups on the symplectic
manifolds. What has been found in [3, 4] in the case of the classical mechanics is the (ﬁrst)
Euler-Lagrange cohomology group of the Euler-Lagrange 1-forms. We have also found that
these cohomology groups may play some important role in the classical mechanics as well as
other dynamical systems such as the volume-preserving systems and so on (some aspects on
these issues have been given in [14, 5, 15]).

In this paper, we introduce the general deﬁnition of these Euler-Lagrange cohomology
groups H 2k−1
EL (M2n, ω), 1 6 k 6 n, on a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold (M2n, ω) with
the symplectic structure ω and study their properties in some details. We show that for
k = 1 and k = n, they are isomorphic to the corresponding de Rham cohomology groups
dR (M2n), respectively. Consequently, due to the Poincar´e duality, the
H 1
EL (M2n, ω)
ﬁrst Euler-Lagrange cohomology group H 1
are dual to each other. We also show that the other Euler-Lagrange cohomology groups
H 2k−1
EL (M2n, ω), 1 < k < n, are diﬀerent from either the de Rham cohomology groups or the
harmonic cohomology groups on (M2n, ω), in general.

EL(M2n, ω) and the highest one H 2n−1

dR(M2n) and H 2n−1

From the cohomological point of view, the ordinary Hamiltonian canonical equations
correspond to 1-forms that represent trivial element in the ﬁrst Euler-Lagrange group on
(M2n, ω) as the phase space. Analog to this fact, it is natural but signiﬁcant to ﬁnd the
general volume-preserving equations on (M2n, ω) from such forms that represent trivial el-
ement in the highest Euler-Lagrange cohomology group H 2n−1
EL (M2n, ω). In this paper, we
introduce this general kind of volume-preserving equations from this point of view. In the
special cases, these equations become the ordinary canonical equations in the Hamilton me-
chanics. Therefore, the Hamilton mechanics has been generalized to the volume-preserving
systems on symplectic manifolds via the cohomology.

This paper is arranged as follows. In section 2, we ﬁrst brieﬂy recall the deﬁnition of the
ﬁrst Euler-Lagrange cohomology group on a symplectic manifold (M2n, ω) and prove that it
is isomorphic to the ﬁrst de Rahm cohomology group on the manifold. Then we introduce
the general deﬁnition of the 2k − 1st Euler-Lagrange cohomology groups for 1 6 k 6 n on
(M2n, ω) in section 3. We ﬁrst indicate that the highest one is equivalent to the 2n − 1st
de Rahm cohomology group. We also indicate that in general they are not isomorphic to
each other and that they are not isomorphic to either the de Rahm cohomology or the
harmonic cohomology on (M2n, ω). In section 4, the relative Euler-Lagrange cohomology is
introduced in analog with the relative de Rahm cohomology. The general volume-preserving
equation is introduced in section 5. Its relations with ordinary canonical equations in the
Hamilton mechanics as well as other volume-preserving systems are discussed. It is clear that
the general volume-preserving equations are the generalization of the ordinary canonical
equations in Hamilton Mechanics. Finally, we end with some discussion and remarks in
section 6.

2 The First Euler-Lagrange Cohomology Group on Sym-

plectic Manifolds

In order to set up notations, we brieﬂy introduce the ﬁrst Euler-Lagrange cohomology group
for what are called the Euler-Lagrange 1-forms on (M, ω) in this subsection. We also prove
that it is isomorphic to the ﬁrst de Rham cohomology group on it.

For a Hamiltonian system with Hamiltonian H = H(q, p) on a 2n-dimensional symplectic
manifold (M, ω), the trajectory, q = q(t) and p = p(t), is determined by the Hamilton
principle. Namely, it is a stationary point of the action functional

S[q(t), p(t)] :=

{ pi(t) ˙q i(t) − H(q(t), p(t)) } dt

can be deﬁned along a curve and E = 0 gives rise to the canonical equations (1).

In fact, it can be deﬁned on the whole manifold M by introducing a congruence of

maximal integral curves of a smooth vector ﬁeld on M

where ˙q i = ˙q i(q, p) and ˙p i = ˙p i(q, p) are functions on M.

Given such a vector ﬁeld, the Euler-Lagrange 1-form can be constructed as follows: The

It is clear that the Euler-Lagrange 1-form (2) depends on the Hamiltonian function H and
a smooth vector ﬁeld X as in eq. (3). Furthermore, it can be shown that the Euler-Lagrange
1-form E is globally deﬁned.

Due to the nilpotency of d, the second operation of d on (4) leads to the globally valid

is the symplectic form on M. Thus, we have

ω := dθ = dpi ∧ dqi

(7)

Theorem 1. The symplectic form ω is conserved if and only if the Euler-Lagrange 1-form
E is closed.

Let ΩEL(M) denote the linear space (an Abelian group) generated by those Euler-
Lagrange 1-forms. That is, a 1-form, say, α is in ΩEL(M) if and only if there exist ﬁnitely
many Euler-Lagrange 1-forms E1, . . . , Ek so that α = E1 + . . . + Ek. It is easy to verify that
ΩEL(M) is a real linear space.

Denote ZEL(M) := {closed 1-forms in ΩEL(M)} and BEL(M) := {exact 1-forms in ΩEL(M)}.

The quotient linear space (also a quotient Abelian group)

HEL(M, ω) := ZEL(M)/BEL(M)

is called the ﬁrst Euler-Lagrange cohomology group.

On the other hand, for an arbitrary vector ﬁeld X, the 1-form

EX := −iX ω

(8)

is zero at a given point x ∈ M if and only if X|x = 0. As a corollary, given a 1-form α on
M, there exists one and only one vector ﬁeld X such that EX = −iX ω = α. Therefore,
eq. (8) deﬁnes a linear isomorphism from the tangent space TxM to the cotangent space
T ∗
x M at every point x, and hence a linear isomorphism from the space of vector ﬁelds X (M)
to the space of diﬀerential 1-forms Ω1(M). When the vector ﬁeld X is as shown in eq. (3),

Thus, the corresponding Euler-Lagrange 1-form E in eq. (2) becomes

As is known, for a Hamiltonian function H on M, there exists uniquely a vector ﬁeld

EX = ˙q i dpi − ˙pi dqi.

E = EX − dH.

. Since X can be an

arbitrary vector ﬁeld on M and so does X −X H, it follows that ΩEL(M) is equal to Ω1(M),
and that every 1-form on M is an Euler-Lagrange 1-form. Thus, an immediate corollary is
HEL(M, ω) is equivalent to the ﬁrst de Rham cohomology group H 1

= EX −X H

dR(M).

For a symplectic manifold (M, ω), a vector ﬁeld X is called a symplectic vector ﬁeld
provided that dEX = 0. A vector ﬁeld X is called a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld provided that
EX = dH with some function H on M. The Lie derivative of ω with respect to a vector
ﬁeld X reads LX ω = diX ω = −dEX . This implies that a vector ﬁeld X is symplectic if
and only if LX ω = 0. A Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld is, of course, a symplectic vector ﬁeld,
but a symplectic vector ﬁeld is not necessarily a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld rather a local
Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld . These are the well-known facts in symplectic geometry [6].

(10)

(11)

In addition, the commutation bracket of two symplectic vectors X and Y is a Hamilto-

nian vector ﬁeld. In fact, it is easy to obtain [6] that

E[X, Y ] = d (ω(X, Y )),

equivalently,

[X, Y ] = X ω(X, Y ).

It implies that the linear space

is a Lie algebra with an ideal

This is due to

XS(M, ω) := { X ∈ X (M) | X is symplectic }

XH(M, ω) := { X ∈ X (M) | X is Hamiltonian }.

[XS(M, ω), XH(M, ω)] ⊆ [XS(M, ω), XS(M, ω)] ⊆ XH(M, ω).

It is obvious that XS(M, ω)/XH(M, ω) is an Abelian Lie algebra. As we have stated, the
linear map from X (M) to Ω1(M), sending X to EX = −iX ω, is a linear isomorphism. The
images of XS(M, ω) and XH(M, ω) under this isomorphism are the spaces of closed 1-forms
Z 1(M) and the exact 1-forms B1(M) on M, respectively. Hence the linear isomorphism
E : XS(M, ω) −→ Z 1(M), X 7−→ EX induces a linear isomorphism
¯E : XS(M, ω)/XH(M, ω) −→ Z 1(M)/B1(M)
[X]

7−→ [EX ].

Namely, an isomorphism from the quotient Lie algebra XS(M, ω)/XH(M, ω) to the ﬁrst
de Rham cohomology group H 1
dR(M), where [X] is the equivalence class of the symplectic
vector ﬁeld X in XS(M, ω)/XH(M, ω) and [EX ] is the cohomology class of the closed 1-form
EX . All the above are summerized in the following theorem:
Theorem 2. Under the commutation bracket, XS(M, ω) is a Lie algebra with an ideal
XH(M, ω). The quotient Lie algebra XS(M, ω)/XH(M, ω) is Abelian, and linearly isomor-
phic to H 1
dR(M), hence to the ﬁrst Euler-Lagrange cohomology group HEL(M, ω).

Therefore, if the symplectic manifold (M, ω) is non-trivial such that H 1

dR(M) 6= 0, there
exists a symplectic vector ﬁeld that is not Hamiltonian. Such a symplectic vector ﬁeld can
be locally written as

Note that although both XS(M, ω) and XH(M, ω) depend on the choice of the symplec-
tic structure, the quotient Lie algebra is, however, independent of it. Therefore, we can
always indicate, without specifying the particular symplectic structure, how many linearly
independent local symplectic vector ﬁelds there are on M. This is the signiﬁcance of the
above theorem.

On the other hand, the above theorem also appears as an exact sequence [6]

0 −→ XH(M, ω) −→ XS(M, ω) −→ H 1

dR(M) −→ 0.

3 The Euler-Lagrange Cohomology Groups on Sym-

plectic Manifolds

Now we are ready to present the deﬁnition and study the properties of a sequence of the
Euler-Lagrange cohomology groups on a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold (M, ω).

Let Λk(T ∗

(M, ω) is the space of volume-preserving vector ﬁelds. Since,

LX (ωk) = diX (ωk),
a vector ﬁeld X belongs to XS(M, ω) if and only if −iX (ωk) is closed. Therefore, we obtain

EL (M).

(24)

3.2 Some Operators

In order to investigate the properties of the Euler-Lagrange cohomology groups, it is needed
to introduce some operators.

For a point x ∈ M, the symplectic form ω can be locally expressed as the well-known
formula ω = dpi ∧ dqi in the Darboux coordinates (q, p). Then let us introduce a well deﬁned
linear map on Λ∗

x(M):

Note that ˆf = 0 when acting on Λ1(T ∗
x M) or Λ0(T ∗
x M). And a map ˆf can be deﬁned on
the exterior bundle Λ∗(M) point by point. Further, a linear homomorphism, denoted also
by ˆf , can be obtained on Ω∗(M). Especially, we have the identity

ˆf := i ∂
∂qi

.

i ∂
∂pi

ˆf ω = n.

Another two operators

ˆe : Λ∗

x(M) −→ Λ∗

x(M), α 7−→ ˆeα = α ∧ ω

and

ˆh : Λk(T

∗
x M) −→ Λk(T

∗

x M), α 7−→ ˆhα = (k − n) α

can also be deﬁned at each x ∈ M.
Lemma 1. The operators ˆe, ˆf and ˆh on Λ∗

x(M) satisfy

[ˆh, ˆe] = 2 ˆe,

[ˆh, ˆf ] = −2 ˆf ,

[ˆe, ˆf] = ˆh,

∀ x ∈ M.

(29)

Proof. These relations can be veriﬁed directly. Here is a trickier proof.

First we deﬁne some “fermionic” operators on Λ∗

x(M)

ψi := i ∂
∂qi

,

χi : α 7−→ dpi ∧ α,

ψi := i ∂
,
∂pi
χi : α 7−→ dqi ∧ α.

For these operators, it is easy to verify that the non-vanishing anti-commutators are

Given an integer 0 6 k 6 2n, we can check that, for any α ∈ Λk(T ∗

x M),

{ψi, χj} = δj
i ,

{ψi, χj} = δi
j.

Therefore,

(χi ψi + χi ψi)α = k α.

ˆh = χi ψi + χi ψi − n.

According to the deﬁnitions,

(34)
Then the relations in eqs. (29) can be obtained when ˆe, ˆf and ˆh are viewed as bosonic
operators.

ˆe = χi χi,

ˆf = ψi ψi.

8

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

For a point x ∈ M and α ∈ Λk(T ∗

x M), (0 6 k 6 2n), the following formulae can be

derived recursively:

[ˆek, ˆf] = k ˆek−1(ˆh + k − 1),

[ˆe, ˆf k] = k ˆf k−1(ˆh − k + 1),

(35)

where k is an arbitrary positive integer. Then there is the lemma:

Lemma 2. Let α be a 2-form. If ˆekα = 0 for some k < n − 1, then α = 0.

Proof. Applying both sides of the ﬁrst eqn in (35) on α, we have

ˆek ˆf α = k (k − n + 1) ˆek−1α.

(36)

Since ˆf α is a number at each point, the left hand side is ( ˆfα) ωk. Applying ˆe on both sides,
we get

Since k + 1 < n, we have ˆf α = 0. Now formula (36) becomes

( ˆf α) ωk+1 = k(k − n + 1) ˆekα = 0.

k (k − n + 1) ˆek−1α = 0.

Since k < n − 1, we get ˆek−1α = 0. Therefore, the value of k can be reduced by 1, and further
it can be eventually reduced to 0.

The above lemma implies that the map sending α ∈ Λ2(T ∗

x M) to α∧ωn−2 ∈ Λ2n−2(T ∗

x M)

is an isomorphism.

Lemma 3. Let x ∈ M be an arbitrary point and X ∈ TxM. Then, for each 1 6 k 6 n,
iX (ωk) = 0 if and only if X = 0.
Proof. We need only to prove that iX (ωk) = 0 implies X = 0. We assume that there is a
nonzero vector X ∈ TxM satisfying iX (ωk) = 0 for some k.

Immediately we have iX (ωn) = 0. Since X is nonzero, a basis {X 1, . . . , X 2n} can
always be obtained where X 1 = X. Consequently, it follows that ωn(X 1, . . . , X 2n) =
(iX (ωn))(X 2, . . . , X 2n) = 0. However, this contradicts with the fact that ω is non-degenerate.
Therefore X has to be zero.

3.3 The Spaces X 2k−1

EL (M, ω)
In the subsection 3.1, we have indicated that XS(M, ω) = X 1
each possible k. The following theorem tells us much more.

Proof. We need only to prove that X 2k−1

In fact, for any X ∈ X 2k−1

S
(M, ω),
LX (ωk) = k (LX ω) ∧ ωk−1 = 0.
Since 0 6 k − 1 6 n − 2 while LX ω is a 2-form, we can use Lemma 2 pointwisely. This
yields LX ω = 0. Thus, X ∈ XS(M, ω). This proves X 2k−1
(M, ω) ⊆ XS(M, ω) when
1 6 k 6 n − 1.

As was implied by Lemma 3, the map X (M) −→ Ω2n−1(M), X 7−→ iX (ωn) is a linear
isomorphism. From LX (ωn) = diX (ωn), it follows that X 2n−1
(M, ω) is isomorphic to
Z 2n−1(M), the space of closed (2n − 1)-forms. Lemma 3 also implies that X 2n−1
(M, ω) is
isomorphic to B2n−1(M), the space of exact (2n − 1)-forms. These can be summarized as in
the following theorem:

Under this isomorphism, X 2n−1

3.4 The Other Euler-Lagrange Cohomology Groups

Although the ﬁrst and the last Euler-Lagrange cohomology groups can be identiﬁed with the
corresponding de Rham cohomology groups, respectively, it is still valuable to know whether
the other Euler-Lagrange cohomology groups are nontrivial and diﬀerent from corresponding
de Rahm cohomology groups in general.

EL (T 2n, ω) is not isomorphic to H 2k−1

In this subsection we will enumerate some examples and properties to seeing about this
problem. We shall point out that, for the torus T 2n with the standard symplectic structure
ω and n > 3, H 2k−1
dR (T 2n) whenever 1 < k < n (see,
Corollary 5.1). In addition, we shall prove that there is a 6-dimensional symplectic manifold
(M, ω) for which the Euler-Lagrange cohomology group H 3
EL(M, ω) is not isomorphic to
H 1
dR(M) (see, Theorem 6). Therefore, these indicate that the Euler-Lagrange cohomology
groups other than the ﬁrst and the last ones are some new features of certain given symplectic
manifolds.

Let Lα be the homomorphism deﬁned by the cup product with a cohomology class [α],
where α is a representative. From the deﬁnition, there is an injective homomorphism of

In fact, for an equivalence class [X]2k−1 ∈ H 2k−1

an arbitrary representative, − 1
k iX (ωk) is a closed (2k − 1)-form. Thus the cohomology class
of this form can be deﬁned to be π2k−1([X]2k−1) and it is easy to verify that this deﬁnition
is well deﬁned. As for the horizontal maps in the ﬁrst row of the above diagram, they are
induced by the identity map on X 2k−1

Recall that on an n-dimensional Lie group G there exists a basis that consists of n left-
invariant vector ﬁelds X 1, . . . , X n. They form the Lie algebra g of G. Let [X i, X j] =

G is called a nilpotent Lie group if g is nilpotent. A nilmanifold is deﬁned to be a closed
manifold M of the form G/Γ where G is a simply connected nilpotent group and Γ is a
discrete subgroup of G.
It is well known that Γ determines G and is determined by G
uniquely up to isomorphism (provided that Γ exists) [7, 8].

There are three important facts for the compact nilmanifolds [9]:

1. Let g be a nilpotent Lie algebra with structural constants ck

ij with respect to some
basis, and let {θ1, . . . , θn} be the dual basis of g∗. Then in the Chevalley–Eilenberg
complex (Λ∗g∗, d) we have

dθk =

ij θi ∧ θj,
ck

k = 1, . . . , n.

(40)

X16i<j<k

2. Let g be the Lie algebra of a simply connected nilpotent Lie group G. Then, by
Malcev’s theorem [7], G admits a lattice if and only if g admits a basis such that all
the structural constants are rational.

3. By Nomizu’s theorem, the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex (Λ∗g∗, d) of g is quasi-isomorphic

to the de Rham complex of G/Γ. In particular,

H ∗(G/Γ) ∼= H ∗(Λ∗g∗, d)

(41)

and any cohomology class [α] ∈ H k(G/Γ) contains a homogeneous representative α.
Here we call the form α homogeneous if the pullback of α to G is left-invariant.

11

These results allow us to compute cohomology invariants of nilmanifolds in terms of the

Lie algebra g, and this simpliﬁes the calculations.

Theorem 6. There exists a 6-dimensional symplectic nilmanifold (M, ω) such that

[X i, X j] = −

X16i<j<k

Proof. To deﬁne the manifold M, it suﬃces to give the Lie algebra. g is a 6-dimensional Lie
algebra generated by the generators X 1, . . . , X 6 with Lie bracket given by

This Lie algebra gives a unique nilmanifold M by the above information on nilmanifolds.
The Chevalley-Eilenberg complex (Λ∗g∗, d) of g which calculates the de Rham cohomology
of M is as follows.

Let A = Λ∗(θ1, . . . , θ6) with the 1-forms θi, 1 6 i 6 6. Their diﬀerentials are given by

the following formulae:

dθ4 = θ1 ∧ θ2,
dθ6 = θ1 ∧ θ5 + θ3 ∧ θ4.

dθ5 = θ1 ∧ θ4 − θ2 ∧ θ3,

Furthermore, the symplectic form ω on M is induced by F = θ1 ∧ θ6 + θ2 ∧ θ4 + θ3 ∧ θ5 in
A. ω is a symplectic form since F ∧ F ∧ F is nontrivial by an easy calculation.

It is not diﬃcult to show

H 1

dR(M) = R3 = span{[θ1], [θ2], [θ3]}

and

H 2

dR(M) = R4 = span{[θ1 ∧ θ3], [θ1 ∧ θ4], [θ2 ∧ θ4], [F ]}
To prove the theorem, it follows from Theorem 5 that it is suﬃcient to prove that ω ∧ θ1
is cohomologically trivial. This follows by the following equation that can be checked easily
and thus completes the proof:

F ∧ θ1 = θ1 ∧ θ2 ∧ θ4 + θ1 ∧ θ3 ∧ θ5 = d(θ2 ∧ θ5 + θ3 ∧ θ6).

3.5 The Euler-Lagrange Cohomology and The Harmonic Coho-

mology

On a given symplectic manifold (M, ω), there also exists the harmonic cohomology in ad-
dition to the de Rahm cohomology. In this subsection we explore the relation between the
Euler-Lagrange cohomology and the harmonic cohomology on (M, ω) and show that they
are diﬀerent from each other in general.

Given a smooth symplectic manifold (M, ω), let Ωk(M) be the space of all k-forms on

M2n. The ∗-operator

∗ : Ωk(M) → Ω2n−k(M)

12

can be introduced [10] in analog with the ∗-operator on a Riemannian manifold. Deﬁne

δ : Ωk(M) → Ωk−1(M),

δ(α) = (−1)k+1 ∗ d(∗α).

It turns out to be that δ = [i(Π), d] (see [10, 11]), where i(Π) is, in fact, the operator ˆf
introduced before.

Remark 1: The operator δ = −∗d∗ was also considered by Libermann (see [12]). Koszul
[13] introduced the operator δ = [d, i(Π)] for Poisson manifolds. Brylinski [11] proved that
these operators coincide.

Deﬁnition: A form α on a symplectic manifold (M, ω) is called symplectically harmonic

if dα = 0 = δα.

We denote by Ωk

hr(M) the linear space of symplectically harmonic k-forms. Unlike the
Hodge theory, there are non-zero exact symplectically harmonic forms. Now, following
Brylinski [11], we deﬁne symplectically harmonic cohomology H ∗

hr(M, ω) by setting

H k

hr(M, ω) = Ωk

hr(M)/(im(d) ∩ Ωk

hr(M)).

Therfore, H k

hr(M, ω) ⊂ H k

dR(M).

We would like to know if the symplectically harmonic cohomology and the Euler-Lagrange

cohomology are isomorphic to each other. The following result answers this question.

Theorem 7. Let M be the 2n dimensional torus T 2n with standard symplectic structure.
Then H 2k−1

(M, ω) are not the same for 1 < k < n.

EL (M, ω) and H 2k−1

This is because in this case the symplectically harmonic cohomology are the same as the

de Rham cohomology and now the result follows from Corollary 5.1.

4 The Relative Euler-Lagrange Cohomology

Let us now propose a deﬁnition of relative Euler-Lagrange cohomology that is the combina-
tion of the above deﬁnition of Euler-Lagrange cohomology and the usual deﬁnition of relative
de Rham cohomology.

Let M be a 2n-symplectic manifold and i : N −→ M be an embedded submanifold.

Recall that the usual relative de Rham forms are deﬁned by

Ωk(i) = Ωk(M) ⊕ Ωk−1(N )

where Ωk−1(N ) is the group of (k − 1)-forms on N . The diﬀerential is given by

d(θ1, θ2) = (dθ1, i∗θ1 − dθ2).

EL (i) = H 2k−2

Proposition 1. H 2k−1
Proof. There is the obvious linear map Ω2k−2(T n) −→ Ω2k−1
θ = dα ∈ Ω2k−2(T 2n) is exact, (0, θ) = d(0, −α) ∈ Ω2k−1
map f : H 2k−2

dR (T 2n) −→ H 2k−1

EL (i), [θ] 7−→ [(0, θ)] can be induced.
This map f is an injection. In fact, if (0, θ) = d(α1, α2), then dα1 = 0, θ = i∗(α1) − dα2.

Thus θ is exact by the fact that any closed form on R2n is exact.

The map f is also an epimorphism: For any closed (θ1, θ2), it is in the same cohomology
class of the element (0, θ2 − i∗(α1) + dα2) = (θ1, θ2) − d(α1, α2), where θ1 = dα1 and α2 is any
form on T n. Obviously, θ2 − i∗(α1) + dα2 is closed and f ([θ2 − i∗(α1) + dα2]) = [(θ1, θ2)].

which the (relative) Euler-Lagrange cohomology is not the corresponding (relative) de Rham
cohomology.

5 The General Volume-Preserving Hamiltonian-like Equa-

tions

In this section, we present the general form for the equations of the volume-preserving
systems from the cohomological point of view on a symplectic manifold (M, ω) as the phase
space of a kind of mechanical systems.

As was mentioned before, the canonical equations of a Hamiltonian system belong to the
image of the ﬁrst Euler-Lagrange cohomology group since the null Euler-Lagrange 1-form,
which leads to the canonical equations, belongs to the image. In this section, we consider
the highest Euler-Lagrange cohomology group and to show its image may lead to the general
volume-preserving equations on symplectic manifolds and the ordinary canonical equations
are their special cases[14, 15]. Thus, this generalizes the Hamiltonian systems.

5.1 The Derivation of the Equations
Theorem 4 indicates that there exists the 1-1 and onto map νn between X 2n−1
B2n−1(M). In addition, there also exists the following operator:

5.2 On The Canonical Hamiltonian Equations, The Trace of 2-

Forms and The Poisson Bracket

It should be noted that for the case of mechanical system with

α =

H ω,

1
n − 1

where H is a function on M, the general volume-preserving equations (52) become the well
known canonical equations and the system becomes a Hamiltonian system with Hamiltonian
function H. Therefore, the equations (52) are the generalization of the canonical equations
in the Hamilton mechanics.

Due to eq. (50) and Theorem 4, the corresponding vector ﬁeld X belongs to X 2n−1

(M, ω)
H
for each 2-form α. On the other hand, given a vector ﬁeld X ∈ X 2n−1
(M, ω), there is always
an exact (2n − 1)-form, dβ, say, such that νn(X) = dβ. Since ⋆ is a linear isomorphism,
there exists a 2-form α = ⋆β satisfying eq. (50). Therefore, when α runs over the whole
space Ω2(M), the corresponding X runs over the whole space X 2n−1
(M, ω). That is, every
X ∈ X 2n−1
(M, ω) can be written in the form of eq. (51).

For the same vector ﬁeld X ∈ X 2n−1

(M, ω), the 2-form α can be chosen at least up to
a closed 2-form. This can be viewed as a symmetry of eqs. (52). If we deﬁne a function tr α
as

H

for each 2-form α, then, using the formula

we obtain that

The above expression is obviously independent of the choice of the Darboux coordinates. Let
X tr α be the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld corresponding to the function tr α. Eq. (50) indicates
that

If f (q, p) is a function on M, then the derivative ˙f = d

dtf (q(t), p(t)) satisﬁes the equation

˙f ωn = n(n − 1) dα ∧ df ∧ ωn−2.

(59)

In fact,

˙f = (LX f )(q, p). And,

Then, according to eq. (50),

(LX f ) ωn = LX (f ωn) = d(f iX ωn).

(LX f ) ωn = −n(n − 1) d(f d ⋆ (α)) = −n(n − 1) df ∧ d(α ∧ ωn−2)
= −n(n − 1) df ∧ dα ∧ ωn−2 = n(n − 1) dα ∧ df ∧ ωn−2.

Thus eq. (59) has been proved.

Especially, as was just mentioned, for the case of α taking value in (53), the system (52)
turns out to be the usual Hamiltonian system. Therefore, f as an observable satisﬁes the
canonical equation in terms of the Poisson bracket:

˙f = {f, H} := X H f =

∂f
∂qi

∂H
∂pi

−

∂f
∂pi

∂H
∂qi .

On the other hand, for such a Hamiltonian system, we can use eq. (59) to obtain

˙f ωn = n d(H ω) ∧ df ∧ ωn−2 = n dH ∧ df ∧ ωn−1 = tr (dH ∧ df ) ωn.

Namely,

Thus, we obtain the relation between the Poisson bracket and the trace of 2-forms:

˙f = tr (dH ∧ df ).

{f, H} = −tr (df ∧ dH).

(60)

(61)

5.3 One Possible Application

The importance of volume-preserving systems can be seen from the following fact:

Theorem 8. If a system S on (M, ω) is not volume-preserving, it can be extended to be
a volume-preserving system S′ on (M × R2, ω′) such that the orbits of S are precisely the
projection of the orbits of S′ onto M.

As a demonstration, let qi and pi (i = 1, . . . , n) be the Darboux coordinates on M and
q0, p0 be the Cartesian coordinates on R2. Then select ω′ = dpµ ∧ dqµ = ω + dp0 ∧ dq0 as the
symplectic structure on M × R2, where the µ is summed over 0 to n. It should be mentioned
that strictly speaking, ω in this expression should be π∗ω in which π : M × R2 −→ M is the
projection. But, as a demonstration, we do not try to give a rigorous description. Suppose
that, on M, LX (ωn) = D ωn where

X = Qi(q1, . . . , qn, p1, . . . , pn)

∂
∂qi + Pi(q1, . . . , qn, p1, . . . , pn)

∂
∂pi

17

is the vector ﬁeld of system S, and D = D(qi, pi) is a function. Then a system S′ on M × R2
corresponding to

X ′

= Qi ∂

∂qi + Pi

∂
∂pi

− D(q1, . . . , qn, p1, . . . , pn)q0 ∂
∂q0

can be constructed. It can be easily checked that S′ is a volume-preserving system. And the
orbits of S are just the projections of the orbits of S′. If all the properties of system S′ are
known, so are the properties of S.

In the previous works [14, 15], more concrete applications have been illustrated and the
relations have also been studied between our general form for the volume-preserving systems
on symplectic manifolds and other volume-preserving systems such as the Nambu mechanics
[16] and Feng-Shang’s volume-preserving algorithm [17]. We will not repeat these topics
here.

In this paper, we have introduced the deﬁnition of the Euler-Lagrange cohomology groups
H 2k−1
EL (M, ω), 1 6 k 6 n, on symplectic manifolds (M2n, ω) and studied their relations
with other cohomologies as well as some of their properties. It is shown that for k = 1, n,
H 1
dR(M) and
H 2n−1
EL (M, ω), 1 < k < n, is neither isomorphic
to the de Rham cohomology H 2k−1
dR (M) nor to the harmonic cohomology on (M2n, ω), and
they are also diﬀerent from each other in general. To our knowledge, these Euler-Lagrange
cohomology groups on (M2n, ω) have not yet been introduced systematically before. It is
signiﬁcant to know whether there are some more important roles played by these cohomology
groups to the symplectic manifolds.

It is also shown that the ordinary canonical equations in Hamilton mechanics correspond
to 1-forms that represent trivial element in the ﬁrst Euler-Lagrange cohomology H 1
EL(M, ω)
on the phase space. Analog to this property, the general volume-preserving equations on
phase space are presented from cohomological point of view with respect to forms which
represent trivial element in the highest Euler-Lagrange cohomology group H 2n−1
EL (M, ω).
And the ordinary canonical equations in Hamilton mechanics become their special cases.
What about the image parts of other Euler-Lagrange cohomology groups? Whether they
also lead to some dynamical equations? These problems are still under investigation.

It is well known that there are a series of conservation laws in classical mechanics closely
related to the so-called phase ﬂow of the canonical equations of the Hamiltonian systems.
The Liouville’s theorem [1], which claims that the volume of a domain in the phase space is
conserved if all points in the domain move along the phase ﬂow, is just such a representative.
From the Euler-Lagrange cohomological point of view, however, these conservation laws
should be generalized to the symplectic ﬂow rather than the phase ﬂow. Further, they may
be related directly to the volume-preserving ﬂow. It is well known that Liouville’s theorem
plays very important roles in both the classical mechanics and statistical physics.
It is
reasonable to expect that the generalized versions of Liouville’s theorem should also play
some important roles.

We have also introduced the conception of relative Euler-Lagrange cohomology. It is of

course interesting to see its applications in Mechanics and Physics.

The ﬁrst Euler-Lagrange cohomology group has been introduced in order to further
introduce its time-discrete version in the study on the discrete mechanics including the

18

symplectic algorithm [3, 4]. Although the ﬁrst Euler-Lagrange cohomology is isomorphic
to the ﬁrst de Rham cohomology, its time discrete version is still intriguing and plays an
important role in the symplectic algorithm. In addition, it has also been introduced in the
ﬁeld theory and their discrete versions of independent variables. The latter is closely related
to the multi-symplectic algorithm [3, 4]. It is of course signiﬁcant to introduce the higher
Euler-Lagrange cohomology groups in these ﬁelds and to explore their applications.

Since the general volume-preserving equations have been introduced on symplectic man-
ifold from the cohomological point of view, it is meaningful to investigate their time-discrete
version and study its relation with the volume-preserving algorithm.

It is well known that symplectic manifolds are closely related to the complex manifolds.
Therefore, it is natural to see what role should be played by the complex counterparts of the
Euler-Lagrange cohomology groups on the complex manifolds.

All these topics are under investigation. We will leave some results on them for further

publications.

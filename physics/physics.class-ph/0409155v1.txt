On possible skewon eﬀects on light propagation

Abstract

We study the general covariant Fresnel equation for the wave covectors and the ray vectors for

the linear spacetime relation between the electromagnetic excitation and the ﬁeld strength.

In

particular, we discuss how the skewon part of the general constitutive tensor disturbs the light

cones of linear Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics. By introducing a convenient parametrization

for the general skewon ﬁeld, we study the inﬂuence of the diﬀerent pieces of the skewon on the

wave and ray surfaces. The conditions are speciﬁed that yield the reduction of the original quartic

surface to the double light cone structure (birefringence) and to the single light cone. Qualitatively,

the eﬀects of the real skewon ﬁeld can be compared to the eﬀects in absorbing material media.

In contrast, the imaginary skewon can be interpreted in terms of the non-absorbing media with

natural optical activity and Faraday eﬀects.

INTRODUCTION

Electromagnetic wave propagation is a very important physical phenomenon in classical

ﬁeld theory.

In general, the geometrical structure of spacetime as well as the intrinsic

properties and the motion of material media can aﬀect the light propagation. In the generally

covariant pre-metric approach to electrodynamics [1, 2, 3, 4], the axioms of electric charge

and of magnetic ﬂux conservation manifest themselves in the Maxwell equations for the

excitation H = (

,

) and the ﬁeld strength F = (E, B):

D

H

dH = J,

dF = 0 .

(1)

These equations should be supplemented by a constitutive law H = H(F ). The latter

relation contains the crucial information about the underlying physical continuum (i.e.,

spacetime and/or material medium). Mathematically, this constitutive law arises either

from a suitable phenomenological theory of a medium or from the electromagnetic ﬁeld

Lagrangian. It can be a nonlinear or even nonlocal relation between the electromagnetic

excitation and the ﬁeld strength.

Earlier, we have investigated the propagation of waves in the most general linear the-

ory. Here we present some results which hold true for all electrodynamical models with an

arbitrary local spacetime relation. This is how we call the constitutive law if it applies to

spacetime (“the vacuum”) itself. From the mathematical point of view, the general linear

spacetime relation is similar to the constitutive relation for a matter with complicated elec-

tric and magnetic properties. Quite naturally, the study and the physical interpretation of

the wave propagation in a manifold with a general spacetime relation appears to be very

close to the analysis of the corresponding wave eﬀects in crystal optics. The latter subject

was extensively studied in the literature, see [5, 6, 7, 8], for example.

In particular, our

analysis reveals the analogy of the eﬀects of the real skewon to the propagation of waves in

absorbing media with circular dichroism, whereas the imaginary skewon ﬁeld appears to be

analogous to the optical activity tensor.

If local coordinates xi are given, with i, j, ... = 0, 1, 2, 3, we can decompose the excitation

and ﬁeld strength 2-forms into their components according to

GENERAL LINEAR CONSTITUTIVE RELATION

We conﬁne ourselves to the case when the electromagnetic excitation and the ﬁeld strength

are related by the linear constitutive law:

The constitutive tensor density κ has 36 independent components. One can decompose

this object into its irreducible pieces. Obviously, contraction is the only tool for such a

decomposition. Following Post [9], we can deﬁne the contacted tensor of type (1,1),

with 16 independent components. The second contraction yields the pseudo-scalar function

The traceless piece

has 15 independent components. These pieces can now be subtracted from the original

By construction, (1)κij

kl is the totally traceless part of the constitutive map:

kl = 0.

Thus, we split κ according to 36 = 20 + 15 + 1, and the (2,2) tensor (1)κij

kl is subject to the

16 constraints (9) and carries 20 = 36

16 components.

−

One may call (1)κij

kl a principal, or a metric-dilaton part of the constitutive law. Without

such a term, the electromagnetic waves are ruled out, see [10, 11, 12]. We further identify the

two other irreducible parts with a skewon and an axion ﬁeld, respectively. Conventionally,

the skewon and the axion ﬁelds are introduced by

GENERAL FRESNEL EQUATIONS: WAVE AND RAY SURFACES

Here we brieﬂy summarize the results of the previous work [10, 15, 16, 17].

In the

Hadamard approach, one studies the propagation of a discontinuity of the ﬁrst derivative of

the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The basic notions are then the wave covector and the ray vector

ﬁelds which encode the information about the propagation of a wave in the spacetime with

a general constitutive relation.

Wave surface

The crucial observation about the surface of discontinuity S (deﬁned locally by a function

Φ such that Φ = const on S) is that across S, the geometric Hadamard conditions are

satisﬁed [Fij] = 0, [∂iFjk] = qi fjk, [Hij] = 0, [∂iHjk] = qi hjk for the electromagnetic ﬁeld

components and their derivatives. Here qi := ∂iΦ is the wave covector. Then using the

Maxwell equations (1) and the constitutive law (3), we ﬁnd the system of algebraic equations

for the jump functions:

χ ijkl qj fkl = 0 ,

ǫ ijkl qj fkl = 0 .

(28)

Solving the last equation in (28) by fij = qiaj

qjai, we ﬁnally reduce (28)1 to
χ ijkl qjqkal = 0. This algebraic system has a nontrivial solution for ai only when the deter-

−

minant of the matrix on the l.h.s. vanishes. The latter gives rise to our generalized covariant

Fresnel equation

ijkl(χ) qiqjqkql = 0 ,

with the fourth order Tamm-Rubilar (TR) tensor density of weight +1 deﬁned by

ijkl(χ) :=

ˆǫmnpq ˆǫrstu χmnr(i χj|ps|k χl)qtu .

(29)

(30)

It is totally symmetric,

ijkl(χ) =

(ijkl)(χ), and thus has 35 independent components.

Diﬀerent irreducible parts of the constitutive tensor (8) contribute diﬀerently to the

general Fresnel equation. Namely, a straightforward analysis [11, 12] shows that the axion

piece drops out completely from the Fresnel tensor, whereas the two remaining irreducible

parts of the constitutive tensor contributes to (30) as follows:

A ray can be deﬁned by a vector ﬁeld s that is dual to the wave covector q and to the

wave front in the following sense [17, 18]:

(32)

Here the 2-forms h = 1

2 hijdxi

dxj and f = 1

2 fijdxi

dxj represent the jumps of the ﬁrst

∧

∧

derivatives of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, whereas q = qi dxi is the wave covector. Equations

(32) are metric-free. The system of the ﬁrst two equations can be analysed in complete

analogy to the system (28). As a result, one arrives at the “dual” Fresnel equation imposed

on the components si of the ray vector s = si∂i :

Like the TR tensor density (30), the totally symmetric tensor density of weight

1 is con-

structed from the components of the constitutive tensor. Explicitly, we have:

As before, complete symmetrization has to be performed over the four indices i, j, k, l, with

the vertical lines separating the indices which are excluded from the symmetrization. Here

we introduced a “double dual” of the constitutive density as

‘Vector’ parametrization

The skewon, as a traceless (1, 1) tensor ﬁeld, has 15 independent components. Given

the spacetimes metric gij, we can decompose skewon into the antisymmetric and symmetric

parts. The latter can be conveniently constructed from a pair of arbitrary (co)vector ﬁelds

vi and wi, so that we ﬁnd, eventually,

Adding the principal terms (40) to the contributions of the skewon (42) and (43), we see

that neither the wave surface nor the ray surface decompose into the product of cones, in

general. In other words, the birefringence is absent. The last terms in (42) and in (43) are

responsible for that. Let us investigate what are the particular cases for the skewon in the

‘double-vector’ representation (41) which do admit the birefringence phenomenon.

Purely antisymmetric skewon

When the skewon ﬁeld is represented by the antisymmetric part only, i.e.,

Si

j = ai

(which is obtained by putting both v = w = 0), then the analysis of (31) shows that the

light propagation is birefringent with one light cone deﬁned by the spacetime metric gij and

the second “optical” metric

This result actually holds true for any other parametrizations of the skewon ﬁeld which will

be considered later. At the same time, the inspection of (38) yields the decomposition of

the ray surface into the light cone of the spacetime metric gij and a second cone deﬁned by

g(2)

Although (44) and (45) look very similar, it is worthwhile to notice that they are not mutual

inverse, and hence, they do not determine a unique geometric structure on the spacetime.

Purely symmetric ‘vector’ skewon

Assume now that the skew-symmetric skewon part is absent, which is evidently achieved

when aij = v[iwj]. Then bi = (1/2)[wi(vw)

viw2],

bi = (1/2)[vi(vw)

(45)

(46)

(47)

(48)

When this condition is violated, the Fresnel wave surface has the 4th order and birefringence

is absent. For the equality sign in (48), the birefringence disappears and the two light cones

coincide. However, one can straightforwardly prove that for (vw)2 = 4λ2

type of the signature correlates with the sign of the determinant of the metric: the latter is

negative for the Lorentzian case and positive for the Euclidean one.

Note that the two conditions (51) and (48) look pretty much similar. In fact, we can verify

that only one of those is an essential inequality. Indeed, when the two vectors are either

both timelike (v2 > 0, w2 > 0) or both spacelike (v2 < 0, w2 < 0), the new condition (51)

makes the ﬁrst constraint (48) redundant, whereas when at least one of the vectors is null,

(51) and (48) coincide. Finally, when one of the vectors is timelike and another spacelike,

the only essential condition is (48) and (51) is redundant.

The conditions obtained are very important for physical classiﬁcation of the skewon eﬀects

on the wave propagation. For example, the spatially isotropic skewon of Pal and Nieves

[21, 22] belongs to the subcase when the two vectors w and v are proportional to each

other.

Indeed, let us consider the ﬂat Minkowski spacetime with the Lorentzian metric

Accordingly, in the special case when skewon and axion become constant ﬁelds, Pal and

Nieves speak of the 4 electromagnetic constants for a vacuum spacetime with spatial isotropy:

The electric constant ε0, the magnetic constant µ0, the spatially isotropic part S of the

skewon

j, and the axion α.

In this special case we evidently ﬁnd (vw)2

v2w2 = 0. Hence (50) yields that both

−

optical metrics have a wrong Euclidean signature. This is in the complete agreement with

our earlier observations [11] where the absence of the wave propagation for the isotropic

Pal-Nieves skewon was reported.

However, now we obviously obtain a far more general result: whereas Pal and Nieves have

considered only a very special conﬁguration with the proportional spacelike vectors v and w,

the wave propagation is actually also absent for any wi

vi and any Riemannian spacetime

metric gij. Then again (vw)2

General parametrization

It is impossible to construct a general parametrization of the skewon ﬁeld using the covari-

ant 4-dimensional objects. Instead, we have to switch to the space and time decomposition

techniques and to allow for a use of the 3-dimensional tensor objects. Then we can write

the required parametrization as follows:

a 


a is the 3D tensor of the type (1,1).
Here ma and nb are (co)vector 3D ﬁelds, whereas sb

sb

Si

j = 



nb

(55)

sc

c ma

.

From now on, the indices from the beginning of the Latin alphabet denote the spatial 3D

components, i.e., a, b, c, . . . = 1, 2, 3. The count of the independent degrees of freedom

(3 + 3 + 9 = 15) shows that we indeed have the most general representation of the skewon

ﬁeld. It is straightforward to establish the dimensions of the diﬀerent pieces of skewon ﬁeld:

we ﬁnd that [sb

a] = [λ0], [nb] = [ε0] and [ma] = 1/[µ0].

With this general parametrization, the linear spacetime relation (18) can now be written

symbolically as follows:

Now we again specialize to the Maxwell-Lorentz principal part (39). Moreover, since

we are speciﬁcally interested in the skewon eﬀects, we will assume for concreteness that

the spacetime metric is the ﬂat Minkowskian one with the Lorentzian signature, gij =

(c2,

δab) = diag(c2,

1). The Euclidean 3-metric tensor δab should not be confused

with the Kronecker delta: the components of the latter are always either 0 or 1, whereas the

former has these values in the Cartesian coordinates only. Then one can further decompose

the 3D skewon tensor into the symmetric and skewsymmetric parts:

sb

a = ub

a + ǫb

aczc.

(58)

Here uab = uba, and the 3D indices are raised and lowered with the help of the 3D Euclidean
ac = ǫbdeδadδce. The covector ﬁeld zc describes the antisym-

a = ubcδac and ǫb

metric, i.e., ub

metric part of the 3D tensor skewon. Obviously, both irreducible tensor skewon parts have

the same dimension [ub

a] = [zc] = [λ0].

Space-time decomposed approach to wave and ray surfaces

The analysis of the wave propagation in the presence of the general skewon ﬁeld (55)

is not possible in the above covariant 4-dimensional framework. Since the space and time

components are explicitly separated in the general parametrization (55), we need the corre-

sponding space and time decomposed approach to the wave and ray surfaces.

Namely, let us denote the independent components of the TR-tensor (30) as follows:

However, the Fresnel surface does not decompose into a product of the two light cones.

Although for n2 = 0, the wave covector surface is a sphere, it becomes a toroid already for

a small positive n2 > 0. The latter looks like a very thin and narrow belt for small values of

n2, which, however, becomes a thick toroid with the inner radius decreasing to zero for large

values of n2. Physically, the hole of this toroid corresponds to the directions in which waves
cannot propagate: In spherical coordinates, the wave propagation occurs for θ0 ≤
where the spherical angle θ is counted from the direction of the skewon vector na and the
limiting angle is determined from sin2 θ0 = 2/(1 + √1 + n2). As we see, the hole disappears

The existence of a hole in the wave covector surface conﬁrms our earlier conclusion about

the dissipative nature of the skewon. In particular, when we continue to the purely imaginary

values of n so that the square becomes negative, n2 < 0, the topology of the Fresnel surface

changes drastically. The hole disappears and the wave covector surface assumes the form of a

u = 0, we have a pure vacuum spacetime relation, and the Fresnel wave surface is then a

sphere. With u

= 0, this sphere degenerates to a pair of intersecting highly deformed toroids

that, for an extremely small values of u, are nearly covering the sphere. But with growing

u, the toroids becomes thin and thinner. The intermediate situation is actually depicted in

Fig 7. Since we do not expect large skewon ﬁelds in general, we here limit ourselves to the

case of the small u.

In the complementary situation, when ma = 0, na = 0 and the symmetric part is absent
b = 0, we obtain a particular case described in Sec. : Birefringence with the

SKEWON EFFECTS IN MATTER

In the previous section we studied the wave propagation on a vacuum spacetime described

by the principal part (1)χijkl of the constitutive tensor (39). We found that the characteristic

eﬀect of the skewon in that case was the emergence of the holes in the wave covector surface.

In physical terms this means the complete damping of the wave propagation in certain

directions. Here we will brieﬂy study the wave propagation in an anisotropic dielectric

medium and demonstrate that a similar eﬀect occurs for the skewon ﬁeld.

The constitutive relation for anisotropic matter is most easily formulated in terms of the

3

3-matrix parametrization (19)-(21). In the absence of the skewon, an arbitrary dielectric

medium is then described by the spacetime relation:

FIG. 9: Fresnel ray vector surface for an anisotropic dielectric medium with ε1 = 39.7, ε2 = 15.4,

ε3 = 2.3. There are two branches, 1/4 part of the outer surface is cut oﬀ in order to show the

second inner branch; we use the dimensionless variables x := s1/s0c, y := s2/s0c, z := s3/s0c.

Here we introduced the dimensionless skewon variable by S := S/λ0.

Analogously we can verify that the dual

Then the equations of wave and ray surfaces cannot be represented any longer in the

compact form (88) and (90). The skewon aﬀects the form of the surfaces by creating typical

holes that correspond to the directions of wave covectors along which there is no wave

propagation. More speciﬁcally, the original two branches of the wave and ray surfaces,

depicted in Figs. 8, 9, merge and form a single non-simply-connected surface. In the process

of such a merging, the four points where the original two branches touched each other become

the wormholes through which one can move from the outer surface into the inner one. A

typical skewon eﬀect is shown in Fig. 10.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this paper we investigated the general covariant Fresnel equation for the wave covectors

as well as for the ray vectors in the case of a linear spacetime relation (3) between the

electromagnetic excitation and the ﬁeld strength. Strictly speaking, the physical information

contained in the ray vector surface is the same as that in the wave covector surface. The

reason why we still analyzed the ray surfaces along with the wave surfaces is twofold. Firstly,

22

FIG. 10: Fresnel wave covector surface for an anisotropic dielectric medium with ε1 = 39.7,

ε2 = 15.4, ε3 = 2.3 in presence of a skewon. The two original branches (cf. with Fig. 8)

are now merged into a single surface with the wormholes replacing the original four points

where the branches touched. The surface is cut into half; we use the dimensionless variables

x := cq1/q0, y := cq2/q0, z := cq3/q0.

we develop the four-dimensional covariant approach to the ray surfaces in complete analogy

with the earlier results obtained for the Fresnel wave covector surfaces. Such a formalism

might be helpful in the study of the various aspects of the wave propagation in media,

since the construction of the ray surfaces is quite a common tool in crystal optics, see

[5, 6, 7, 8, 18, 23]. Secondly, we demonstrate explicitly that although the ray surface is dual

to the wave surface (which is also clearly seen from the ﬁgures above), the optical metric,

which is naturally derived in the case of birefringence, is diﬀerent for the wave and ray

surfaces and the two metrics derived are not dual to each other.

The skewon part (10), (15) of the constitutive tensor was in the center of our study.

By introducing its general parametrization (55), we separated the skewon eﬀects from the

electric Faraday type, from the magnetic Faraday type, and from the magneto-electric optical

activity type. The inﬂuence of a skewon on the wave and ray Fresnel surfaces is qualitatively

diﬀerent in these three case. This is illustrated by the ﬁgures in the corresponding parts of

the previous sections. However, the characteristic sign of the skewon is the emergence of the

speciﬁc holes in the Fresnel surfaces that correspond to the directions in space along which

the wave propagation is damped out completely. This eﬀect is in complete agreement with

our earlier conclusion on the dissipative nature of skewon [3, 10, 11].

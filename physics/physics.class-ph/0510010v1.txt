Abstract: We describe the correct cubic relation between the mass conﬁguration of a Kater
reversible pendulum and its period of oscillation. From an analysis of its solutions we conclude
that there could be as many as three distinct mass conﬁgurations for which the periods of small
oscillations about the two pivots of the pendulum have the same value. We also discuss a real
compound Kater pendulum that realizes this property.

l =

which is called the equivalent length of our physical pendulum.
By the Huygens–Steiner theorem (also known as the “parallel axis theorem”) it is possible
to write

I = mh2 + I0

where I0 is the moment of inertia with respect to the center of mass. By squaring equation
(1) we get the following quadratic relation

In 1817 Captain H.Kater thought to use this last relation to empirically check the
Huygens–Steiner theorem. At this purpose he constructed his reversible pendulum con-
sisting of a plated steel bar equipped with two weights, one of which can be moved along
the bar. This pendulum is reversible because it can oscillate about two diﬀerent suspen-
sion points realized by two knife edges symmetrically located on the bar. By adjusting
the movable weight, it is possible to obtain a pendulum mass conﬁguration such that the
periods about the two pivots coincide, the equivalent length l is the distance between the
two knife edges and condition (4) is satisﬁed.

The measurement of such a common period T , of the total mass m and of the distance l
between the two knife edges, gives then an easy way to perform an empirical measurement
of the earth’s (apparent) gravitational acceleration g by applying formula (2). This is
why the Kater reversible pendulum is one of the favourite instrument to measure g in
student labs.
Anyway there is a subtle point in this procedure which is the determination of the right
mass conﬁguration of the pendulum. This problem gives rise to the following two ques-
tions:
(1) how many possible positions of the movable weight determine a “good” mass con-
ﬁguration for which the periods of small oscillations about the two pivots coincide?
(2) when a good mass conﬁguration is realized, is the equivalent length l necessarily

represented by the distance between the pivots?

If the answer to the second question is assumed to be “yes” then the quadratic equation
(3) gives precisely two possible good mass conﬁgurations since h depends linearly on the
position x of the movable weight. These mass conﬁgurations can then be empirically
obtained by the following standard procedure [1]:

•

by varying the movable mass position x collect two series of data (x, T ), one for each
pivot,

3

(5)

M. Rossi and L. Zaninetti / Central European Science Journals 1 (2003) 1–25

make a parabolic ﬁtting of the data by means of two parabolas of the following type:

•

T = ax2 + bx + c

•

these parabolas meet in at most two points (x1, T ), (x2, T ): positions x1 and x2
determine the two desired good mass conﬁgurations.

Such a parabolic ﬁtting is justiﬁed by two considerations. The ﬁrst one is that we are
looking for two good mass conﬁgurations, then the ﬁtting curves have to admit at most
two intersection points. The second one is the empiric observation of the data which
apparently seem to be arranged just along two convex parabolas with vertical axis.

This is what is usually done although the right answer to the second question should
be “no”, as was ﬁrstly pointed by Shedd and Birchby in 1907 [2, 3, 4]. Their remark seems
to have escaped general attention, perhaps due to the fact that, if the pendulum is well
assembled, the previous parabolas meet at points whose abscissas give almost exactly the
good mass conﬁgurations having the distance between pivots as equivalent length. The
latter is much easier determined than any other equivalent length associated with further
good mass conﬁgurations of the pendulum [5]! But what does mean “well assembled”?

To ﬁx ideas consider an “ideal” Kater pendulum consisting of an idealised massless
a and mm at a
rigid rod (x-axis) supporting two identical point masses, mf ﬁxed at
variable position x. The assembly has two distinct suspension points for the oscillations
d/2 and at +d/2 , a sketch of this ”ideal” pendulum is reported in Figure 1.

which in general does not coincide with the distance d between the two pivots.
Therefore for an ideal Kater pendulum the answers to the previous questions are:
(1) there are at most three possible positions of the movable weight which determine a

good mass conﬁguration;

(2) no; there always exists a good mass conﬁguration whose associated equivalent length

does not coincide with the distance between pivots.

An immediate consequence is that a parabolic ﬁtting of the empirical data (x, T ) can’t
be the best ﬁtting since two parabolas never meet at three points! Moreover in some
particular cases a parabolic ﬁtting may cause strong distortions in determining good
mass conﬁgurations. For example:

•

•

∼ ±

if either d/√2 < a or (8) is not satisﬁed, the ideal Kater pendulum admits a unique
good mass conﬁguration; typically a parabolic ﬁtting of data in this situation gives
parabolas meeting only at imaginary points and the procedure stops;
d/2 then the ﬁrst solution of (9) is quite near to one of the two further

symmetric solutions; a parabolic ﬁtting of data gives only two intersection points
but we do not know if one (and which one?) of them is nearer to the position

associated with l than to the one associated with l′; in this situation also l
they are not equal; then associating l with a so determined good mass conﬁguration
may cause a relevant error in the ﬁnal value of g.

bar. When a physical pendulum with mf
conﬁguration? Does it occur again?

The answer is “yes”. The key observation is that, for both pivots, the variable position
x of the movable mass and the resulting period T of small oscillations are related by a
cubic expressions of the following type (period-distance relations)

ax2 + bx + c = T 2 + dxT 2 ,

(13)

where the coeﬃcients a, b, c, d depend on the pendulum parameters. This is precisely
what Shedd and Birchby pointed out in their papers [2, 3, 4] giving theoretical and
empirical evidences: they called the two (one for each pivot) equations (13) the equations

6
6

M. Rossi and L. Zaninetti / Central European Science Journals 1 (2003) 1–25

of the reversible pendulum (see equations (10) and (11) of their ﬁrst paper). Here we
will refer to (13) as the cubic period–distance relation of the physical Kater pendulum
considered. Note that only coeﬃcients a, b, c, d depend on the pendulum parameters,
while the polynomial type of equation (13) does not depend on the choice of the pendulum.
Thus, we can reduce the search for good mass conﬁgurations to a simple cubic equation
similar to Eq. (9).

A ﬁrst point in the present paper is to give a mathematically rigorous proof of the

following

Theorem 1.1. Let p1 (x, y) , p2 (x, y) be the following cubic polynomials

pi (x, y) = Aix2 + Bix + Ci

y2

Dixy2

,

i = 1, 2 .

−

−

where Ai, Bi, Ci, Di are real coeﬃcients and D1
= D2 . Then they admit always two real
common roots and two pairs of complex conjugated common roots which may be real under
suitable conditions on coeﬃcients Ai, Bi, Ci, Di. Thinking them as points in the complex
plane (x, y) they are symmetric three by three with respect to the x–axis. Moreover these
are all the common roots they can admit (that is: all the further common roots are “at
inﬁnity”).

This algebraic result leads to the following physical statement:

Corollary 1.2. A physical Kater pendulum, with a “suﬃciently long” bar, admits al-
ways a “good” mass conﬁguration whose associated equivalent length does not in general
coincide with the distance between the pivots.

Under “suitable conditions” on the pendulum parameters, it may admit two further
“good” mass conﬁgurations. They correspond to symmetric positions of the movable mass,
with respect to the middle point of the bar (if also the pivots are symmetrically located).
They admit a common associated equivalent length which is precisely the distance between
the pivots.

Moreover the pendulum can’t admit any further good mass conﬁguration.

We will specify the meaning to the vague expressions “suﬃciently long” and “suitable
conditions”.

Although Shedd and Birchby knew in practice the content of the previous statement
(they actually wrote down all the three good mass conﬁgurations in period–distance terms
– see formulas (27) of their ﬁrst paper) they couldn’t give a rigorous proof of it. They
studied the geometry of the curves determined by the cubic period–distance relations
by means of an old and non–standard “Newton’s classiﬁcation”. They then arrived to
conclude that (see the bottom lines of p. 281 in their ﬁrst paper):
“Of the nine possible intersections of two cubic curves, in the present case three are
imaginary or at inﬁnity, three belong to the condition that T is negative, and three
belong to positive values of T , and can hence be experimentally realized.”

This conclusion does not exclude that, under some suitable conditions on the pendulum
parameters, at least two of the three “imaginary or at inﬁnity” intersections may become
real and maybe physically realizable giving more than three good mass conﬁgurations.
Actually we will see that these three intersections are not imaginary but deﬁnitely “at
inﬁnity” and they can never give physical results.

A second aim of the present paper is to observe that the best ﬁtting of empirical data
(x, T ) is then given by two cubic curves of type (13) instead of two parabolas of type
(5). We will support this remark by experimental evidence for a real compound Kater
pendulum.

The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 is devoted to prove Theorem 1.1. and
the physical statement of Corollary 1.2.. Here we set the main notation and describe the
physics of a real Kater pendulum. The proof of Theorem 1.1. is based on elementary
elements of complex algebraic and projective geometry. Anyway a non–interested reader
may skip it without losing any useful element to understand what follows. In Sec. 3 we
describe an eﬀective experiment. Section 4 is devoted to the analysis of experimental data
by a linear ﬁt of the period-distance cubics. An estimate of their intersection points gives
the good mass conﬁgurations and the associated periods for our real Kater pendulum.
Then the value of g. A comparison with a parabolic ﬁtting of data is then given.

Appendix A is devoted to discuss the “suitable conditions” on the pendulum param-
eters under which the pendulum admits all the possible good mass conﬁgurations (see
Corollary 1.2.). In Appendix B we collect some further numerical methods to analyse
our empirical data.

2 Physics of the Kater reversible pendulum

Notation. Consider a physical Kater pendulum composed of a rigid bar equipped with
two weights (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). The pendulum can be suspended by two knife–edges,
c1 and c2, symmetrically located on the bar. The weight mf is placed in a ﬁxed position
which is not between the knives. The other one, mm, can be moved along the bar. Small
oscillations of the pendulum are parameterised by an angle ϕ such that ϕ
sin ϕ, that
is, ϕ3

0. The equation of motion of the pendulum is then given by

where g is the earth’s apparent gravitational acceleration, m is the total mass of the
pendulum, hi is the distance of the center of mass from the knife–edge ci, and Ii is the
moment of inertia about ci.

Assume now that the movable mass mm is placed at a point x0 on the bar such that

Such a point will be called a characteristic position of the pendulum. Equation (18) can
be satisﬁed if and only if l1 = l2 = l(x0). The length l = l(x0) will be called the character-
istic length of the pendulum associated with the characteristic position x0. Analogously
the associated periods T (x0j ) will be the characteristic periods of the pendulum. The
knowledge of l(x0j ) and T (x0j ) for each j = 1, 2, 3 yields the value of g from the relation

It is then easy to observe that l(x02) and l(x03) are equal and constant because x02 and
x03 are symmetric. Precisely

l(x02) = l(x03) = h1 + h2 = d ,

and they do not depend on the other physical parameters of the pendulum. On the

The reader may compare the characteristic positions (33), (35) and the associated char-
acteristic lengths (39), (38), now obtained, with those given in Eq. (27) by Shedd and
Birchby[2].

Moreover the period–distance relations of the pendulum (what Shedd and Birchby
called “the equations of the Kater pendulum” [2]) can be obtained by Eq. (29) when h1
and h2 are expressed as in Eqs. (31). When the pendulum oscillates about the pivot ci,
the period Ti and the distance x results to be related by the following cubic relations

Throughout the experiment the movable mass mm will be placed in successive posi-
tions, generally 10 cm from each other, except near the theoretical characteristic positions
(57) where the distances decrease (see the second column in Table 2) ∗
. The period of
small oscillation about the two pivots are measured for all those positions of mm. These
periods are measured by recording the time of each of 9 consecutive oscillations when
1◦. For this purpose we used a photogate

the pendulum starts from the angle ϕ0
timed by an electronic digital counter †
. We repeated the procedure for 18 positions of
mm, at ﬁrst with respect to c1 and then c2. The average of the 9 values is taken to be the
period at the given position of mm whose error is given by half of its maximum excursion,
0.0018 s. The initial angle ϕ0 is suﬃciently small that an equation similar to

by adding corrective terms,[9, 6] to the period expression given in Eq. (19). In the next
section we will evaluate such a correction. The results are reported in Table 2.
∗ We did not choose positions too close to the estimated characteristic positions to prevent the casual
occurrence of coincident period measures about the two pivots. In fact our distance measures are eﬀected
1 mm. Such an error would cause a strong distortion in determining the empirical
by an error of
characteristic positions. One of them would be directly determined by direct measure and its error would
not be lessened by the ﬁtting procedure.

4 The linear ﬁtting procedure

We now describe a linear ﬁtting procedure used to ﬁt the experimental data listed in
Table 2 and empirically determine the characteristic positions. The numerical compu-
tations were obtained using MAPLE § and some FORTRAN code ¶ . From a numerical
point of view we should ﬁt the data by cubic polynomials like those in Eq. (40). Such a
ﬁtting can be treated linearly because the coeﬃcients D1 and D2 may be determined a
priori by Eqs. (41) and (44) which involve only the known physical parameters listed in
Table 1. We obtain

D1 = (3.983

The plotting package is PGPLOT 5.2 developed by T. J. Pearson.

Two sources of error with period measurements were considered

•

•

In any position and for both pivots, we considered the standard deviation of the 9
period electronic measurements, varying from 0.0003 s to 0.0036 s .
The systematic error that formula 70 introduces on the data. For example when
12◦ the shift introduced on
T=2.3 s (the maximum period here analysed) and ϕ0
T is 0.006 s .

∼

After this analysis we considered σT = 0.006 s as estimated error for period measurements.

The obtained results are reported in Table 3 , Table 4 and visualised in Fig.4.
The merit function χ2 and the associated p–values are reported in Table 5 and each

of them have to be understood as the maximum probability to obtain a better ﬁtting.

The estimated cubic coeﬃcients of Table 3 and Table 4 allow us to evaluate the
characteristic positions and the associated characteristic periods by intersecting their
k We also know that B1 = 0 and the number of coeﬃcients to be estimated by the ﬁtting procedure can
be reduced.

∗∗ These two cubic curves represent the period-distance relations in the plane (x, T ) when oscillations
are considered about c1 or c2 respectively. Then their common points coordinates give the characteristic
positions of the pendulum and the associated periods. We have already observed in Sec. 2 that these
cubics are symmetrical with respect to the x-axis. More precisely each of them is composed by two
symmetrical branches. The branches lying under the x-axis are not physically interesting since their
period coordinate T is negative. Therefore the only interesting common points of these two cubic curves
are the intersection points of their upper branches.

needs two input parameters, the local height above sea level and latitude, which in our case are 236 m
and 45.05333◦ respectively to give the local value of g. For Turin this formula gives g = 980.5937 cm s−2,
which diﬀers from gT by 61 ppm.

5 Conclusions

We summarise the main results of our theoretical and numerical analysis
(1) The three solutions of the Kater pendulum concerning the distance–period relation-
ship discovered in 1907 by Shedd and Birchby in 1907 [2, 3, 4] are classiﬁed in a
modern context

(2) The ﬁrst solution of the distance–period relationship allows to deduce a new for-
mula of g via the second equivalent length both in the idealized pendulum and in a
commercial Kater pendulum, see respectively formula(12) and (39)

(3) One of the main targets of our work ”the evaluation of g” gives oscillating results

•

•

: our best numerical ﬁt to T 2 produces (the linear ﬁt + non–linear correction)
a value of g that is 191 ppm smaller than the ”true vale”
: our worst ﬁt to T 2 (the non–linear ﬁt + non–linear correction) gives a value
of g that is 1978 ppm smaller than the ”true vale”

(4) Concerning the ﬁt to T through a parabola we obtain high values of χ2 (χ2=893 for
C1 and χ2=12.51 for C2) with respect to the linear ﬁt to T 2 (χ2=2.69 for C1 and
χ2=1.57 for C2). These high values of χ2 allow to rule out the physical signiﬁcance
of this type of ﬁt.

which are non-linear in the unknown coeﬃcients. The procedure is to apply the NAG-
Mark14 subroutine E04FDF to ﬁnd an unconstrained minimum of a sum of 18 nonlinear
functions in 4 variables (see Ref. [13]).

The ﬁnal value of g is reported in the Table B.1.

B.2 The Cramer interpolation method

We present here a method that reduces our analysis in a local neighbourhood of the
estimated characteristic positions where a cubic behaviour of the ﬁtting curves is imposed.
From Eqs. (41), (44), and (63) we know that D1 and D2 are completely determined
by the pendulum parameters. Moreover, from Eqs. (41) we know that B1 = 0. So to
2, we need to interpolate two points of the
recover the remaining coeﬃcients of
C
ﬁrst set of data in Table 2 and three points of the second one respectively. We have to
solve a 2
3 linear system by applying the Cramer theorem (which is the
most practical method for solving a linear system of equations). If we choose data points
that are close to a characteristic position, then the nearest point in
2 to the chosen
data will give an empirical estimation of such a characteristic position and its associated
period. An iterated application of this procedure will produce a distribution of periods
and we may obtain g from the mean value and its statistical error from the standard
deviation (see the last line of Table B.2).

The results obtained for every interpolation are reported in Table B.2; the chosen
data points in the second and third columns are enumerated as they appear in Table 2.

B.3 Cubic Spline Interpolation

The last data analysis method to be proposed is the cubic spline interpolation (subrou-
tine SPLINE and SPLINT from Numerical Recipes II). Once the three intersections are

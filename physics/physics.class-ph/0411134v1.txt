We show that the classical wave equation for a single oscillatory charge
which may be in general also traveling in a potential ﬁeld V , embraces a
separable component equation describing the particle dynamics. We show the
latter is equivalent to Schr¨odinger’s wave equation. In this ﬁrst paper of a
series we infer Schr¨odinger’s wave equation for such a charged system in zero
potential ﬁeld.

I. CLASSICAL WAVE EQUATION FOR PARTICLE’S TOTAL WAVE

We consider a single oscillatory charge q ﬁrstly localized at X in a one-dimensional box
along X-axis, in a simplest zero potential ﬁeld V = 0. According to Maxwellian electro-
magnetism, owing to its oscillation assumed transverse to the X-axis the charge generates
electromagnetic waves in both X- and −X-directions.

The wave process may be described as conventionally by the electric ﬁeld displacement
E (or magnetic ﬁeld B), or by a counterpart of E (or B) representing the corresponding
mechanical scheme; the latter is not of direct concern of this paper so is not to be introduced.
With either of the representations in mind, we may rather generally describe the periodic
process with a dimensionless wave displacement ϕ(X, T ) and identically ϕ(−X, T ). This
function, describing an electromagnetic wave propagated in a one-dimensional path in the
uniform vacuum, is as based on optical experimental physics a plane wave:

ϕ(X, T ) = CKei(KX−ΩT +α),

with CK being the displacement amplitude; and ϕ(X, T ) is propagated in the vacuum with
the velocity of light, c. Here K and Ω(= 2πV) = cK are the wavevector and angular
frequency of the wave, or preﬁxed with a ”normal mode” in considering the correspondence
of the waves to normal mode waves in the solution for a mechanical wave (see also below).
When making analogy to an ordinary mechanical wave, a wave displacement as of (1) is
given as the solution to the classical wave equation

(1)

(2)

Alternatively, (2) can also be set up based on the argument that, as being in direct proportion
to the electromagnetic energy ﬂux transmitted with it in a non-absorbing vacuum, ϕ(X, T )
must therefore satisfy the time dependent Laplacian equation characterizing the conservation

c2 d2ϕ

dX 2 =

of energy, which is (2). In a much elaborate treatment where a corresponding mechanical
scheme is fully incorporated to the wave motion, the classical wave equation (2) can be
directly set up based on Newton’s laws of motion as for the ordinary mechanical waves, and
the mechanical wave displacement corresponding to (1) is given as a solution [1].

We shall hereafter refer to the oscillatory electric charge of an amount of charge q (which
may be called a vaculeon in the case of an elementary charge) and oscillatory mechanical
energy E as a whole as a particle. By this designation, the oscillation represents then an
internal process of the particle. When regarding its external process only, e.g. the trans-
lational motion of velocity v of the system, we need then only to represent this external
process without regarding the internal one. The two identical waves of functions ϕ(X, T )
and ϕ(−X, T ) of (1) are thus consequences of the particle’s internal charge oscillation, and
may therefore be called the component (normal mode) waves of the particle. As a funda-
mental equation of quantum mechanics, the electromagnetic waves as described by (1) have
a mechanical energy

As the waves are here the component waves of the particle, E of (3) amounts therefore in turn
to all of the internal energy of the particle. Then, from Einstein’s mass energy equivalence
postulate, E is related to the particle’s rest mass M by E = Mc2, or

E = hV

hV = Mc2

In a systematic theoretical framework (4) is directly given as a Newtonian-Maxwellian solu-
tion for particle formation [1].

Consider next our particle as deﬁned above is set in motion at velocity v in X-direction; v
is assumed here to be within a non relativistic or classic-velocity regime, expressed formally
by (v/c)2 → 0. Owing to its charge (source) motion the two monochromatic component
waves of the single frequency Ω must now be subject to a Doppler eﬀect, and be diﬀeren-
tiated into an approach- and a recede- Doppler waves, ϕ†
K‡. The wave equations
corresponding to (2) accordingly become:

Being bound within walls assumed here non-absorbing, the particle traveling to the right
will upon arriving at the right wall be reﬂected from the wall, and travel to the left during
K†(X, T ) and ϕ‡∗
which it generates waves denoted by ϕ†∗
K‡(−X, T ). The wave equations for the
latter write similarly as (5). The two sets of component waves, produced by the forwarding
and reﬂected charges, will be repeatedly reﬂected between the boundaries, prevailing across
the entire one-dimensional box simultaneously at any one time, superimposing thereby onto
each other and giving a total wave displacement. Suppose the functions ϕ†

malization factor C; ψ(X, T ) is a standing wave when between such boundaries as the walls
of the one-dimensional box here. Adding in turn together the two equations of (5), and the
corresponding two equations for the reﬂected charge, we get

Substituting (6) into (a), we have that the classical wave equation for the particle’s total
wave displacement

=

∂2ψ(X, T )
∂T 2

For the component waves as of (1) which diﬀer one another only in their relative phases,
as may be readily completed by the reader (or [1] may be consulted) ψ can be explicitly
obtained from a direct superposition of these to be:

ψ(X, T ) = 4CCK cos(KX) sin(KdX)ei(Ω+Ωd)T

Where K and Ω are the undisplaced (i.e. not being Doppler-displaced) wavevector and
angular frequency of the particle’s component waves as before; whereas Kd and Ωd are the
mean Doppler displacements in wavevector and in frequency, respectively, and are purely as a
result of the particle’s translational motion of velocity v. It is straightforward to obtain based
on Doppler equations, Λ† = Λ(1 − v/c) and Λ‡ = Λ(1 + v/c) for the Doppler wavelengths,
that Ωd is related to Ω by

Ωd = Ω

c (cid:19)

(cid:18)
We also know from de Broglie that the de Broglie variables of a particle are purely as a
result of the particle (center-of-mass) dynamics, here the translational motion with velocity
v. From the above connection, one may plausibly identify Kd as the particle’s de Broglie
wavevector and Ωd the de Broglie frequency. A profound justiﬁcation of the above assignment
is given in [1].

II. DIMENSION TRANSFORMATION

From inspecting (8) we see that the particle’s total dynamics involves two distinct wave
processes—the undisplaced (normal mode) wave motion ϕ and the de Broglie wave motion

3

associated with Kd, Ωd. The two processes as given in (7) are apparently not mutually
separated. However, (7) has an intuitively undesirable dimension of ”force per unit mass of
the elastic medium propagating the wave per displacement amplitude”. As an attempt to
decouple the two wave processes, we below transform equation (7) to having a dimension of
”energy”. We start by utilizing a ﬁrst speciﬁc feature of the function of (8), namely that ψ
may be written as a product of two functions:

Where

ψ(X, T ) = CψK,Kd(X)eı(Ω+Ωd)T

ψK,Kd(X) = 4CK cos(KX) sin(KdX)

Furthermore, ψ(X, T ) and its ﬁrst and second time-derivatives have the following recursive
relations:

∂ψ(X, T )
dT

∂2ψ(X, T )
∂T 2

= i(Ω + Ωd)ψKd(X)ei(Ω+Ωd)T = i(Ω + Ωd)ψ(X, T )

= −(Ω + Ωd)2ψKd(X)ei(Ω+Ωd)T = i(Ω + Ωd)

∂ψ(X, T )
∂T

Substituting (13) into the right-hand side of (7), rearranging, and multiplying both sides
with the Dirac constant ¯h = h/2π, with h being Planck constant, we have

¯hc2 ∂2ψ(X, T )
∂X 2

= i¯h(Ω + Ωd)

∂ψ(X, T )
∂T

(7a) has the desired energy dimension in diﬀerential forms: On the right-hand side, ¯h(Ω+Ωd)
has the dimension of energy, and ∂ψ
∂T as a whole has a
dimension of the time rate of energy, hence power. The left-hand side has the dimension of
second spatial variation of energy.

∂T time rate; the term ¯h(Ω + Ωd) ∂ψ

III. DECOUPLING OF TWO WAVE PROCESSES A. WAVE EQUATION

The dynamics of a single particle is in classical terms represented by the particle’s trans-
lational kinetic energy Ev = 1
2 Mv2 and linear momentum Mv. The very dynamics is in
quantum physics characterized by the de Broglie variables, which is on the right-hand side
of (7a) apparently represented by the second term containing Ωd. The ﬁrst term describes
accordingly the undisplaced normal mode wave dynamics, with Ω being a variable for the
classic-velocity regime here.

The left-hand side of (7a) must accordingly also contain a component of the particle
dynamics and this ought to be contained in c2. As based on Einstein’s phenomenological
postulate, or as is given directly from Newtonian solution for particle formation [1], c2 is
related to the particle’s unclassic-velocity mass m as:

Or

c2 =

for (v/c)2 → 0, with M being the particle’s rest mass as before. (15)′ is an approximation
at (v/c)2 → 0, which being factually to a high degree when expressing particle’s total rest
energy [1]. But this approximation is inevitably a poor one for the particle dynamics in
question here, since the kinetic energy (being a classic-velocity quantity) of the latter is
itself of order v2, and is always of ﬁrst-order signiﬁcance no matter how small (v/c)2 is. So,
to ensure an exact representation of the particle dynamics, we reset all variables of equation
(7a) to their unclassic-velocity form, separate out the particle center-of mass term on the
left-hand side, and then take the classic-velocity limit. In doing so, (7a) ﬁrstly writes as:

¯h2ω
m

∂2ψ(X, T )
∂X 2

∂ψ(X, T )
∂T

Here, as according to Einstein’s phenomenological equation, and as is in [1] directly obtained
from Newtonian-Maxwellian solution for particle formation, m and M are related by:

wave process, whereas the second term is one related to the de Broglie wave process.

IV. DECOUPLING OF TWO WAVE PROCESSES B. WAVE FUNCTION

We now exploit a second feature in ψ(X, T ) of (10), namely that it can write as a product

of two mutually orthogonal functions

and
That is

Φ(X, T ) = 4CK cos(KX)eıΩT
Ψ (X, T ) = C sin(KdX)eıΩdT .

ψ(X, T ) = Φ(X, T )Ψ (X, T )

It is easy to identify that Φ(X, T ) describes the undedisplaced total normal mode wave
displacement and Ψ (X, T ) the de Broglie wave displacement of the particle, each in dimen-
sionless unit here. Substituting (10)′ into (7e), expanding the derivatives, multiplying out
each terms, and ﬁnally multiplying 1/Ψ Φ to each term of (7e), we get

Two mathematically orthogonal functions, Φ and Ψ here, correspond in physical terms to
two mutually uncorrelated processes, here the normal mode and the particle waves, which
being by virtue of their wave nature (with a random phase) statistical processes. It thus
follows that the terms involving the cross-term products of the two wave processes, must on
average make each but zero contribution to the stationary-state energy equation; that is the
ﬁrst and fourth terms on each side of (7f) should drop out. (7f) then reduces to

V. SCHR ¨ODINGER EQUATION WITH ZERO POTENTIAL

A single particle in a one-dimensional box (of non-absorbing walls) with a zero potential
ﬁeld and having no contact with external environment describes an isolated system; and
its total dynamics is hence an adiabatic process. That the particle’s two constituent wave
processes are uncorrelated then implies in energy terms that, any local and instantaneous
variations (oscillations) in energy which being associated with wave displacements, must
occur within the respective wave processes. By this virtue, the energy equation (7g) for the
total wave at any chosen location and time, must therefore be necessarily guaranteed by the
energy equations for the respective individual waves:

∂2Φ
∂X 2 = i¯hΩ
∂2Ψ
∂X 2 = i¯hΩd

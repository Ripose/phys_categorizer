Abstract

We present the special theory of relativity taking the Doppler eﬀect as the starting
point, and derive several of its main eﬀects, such as time dilation, length contrac-
tion, addition of velocities, and the mass-energy relation, and assuming energy and
momentum conservation, we discuss how to introduce the 4-momentum in a nat-
ural way. We also use the Doppler eﬀect to explain the “twin paradox”, and its
version on a cylinder. As a by-product we discuss Bell’s spaceship paradox, and
the Lorentz transformation for arbitrary velocities in one dimension.

1 Introduction

During 2005 we celebrated Einstein’s annus mirabilis, a year in which the course of
physics changed in a profound way. There were several events celebrating Einstein’s
contributions, and this gave us the opportunity to go through some of the fundamentals
of physics, following the path Einstein laid out for us, and rethinking ways to present
some of his ideas, in particular the special theory of relativity (STR) [1].

In this article we present an elementary approach to the STR, taking the Doppler
eﬀect as starting point . We will treat only one dimensional motion, for simplicity, but
this is certainly not a limiting asumption, since one can easily generalize to arbitrary
motions by combining Lorentz boosts and rotations.
Initially we derive the Doppler
eﬀect formula directly from the two postulates of the STR, namely

• The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference

• The velocity of light is the same for all inertial observers

As a matter of fact one should consider only one postulate, since the principle of the
constancy of the speed of light is a consequence of the ﬁrst postulate, as Einstein points
out in the E = Mc2 paper (see, for example, [1]): all one needs to do is to qualify what are
the laws of physics that are supposed to be valid in all frames of reference. If one assumes
Newton’s laws, one obtains classical kinematics. If one takes Maxwell’s equations, then
one is naturally led to a new view of space and time.

Once we have derived the relativistic Doppler formula, we apply it to several diﬀerent
thought experiments, which will allow us to derive all of relativistic kinematics: time
dilation, length contraction, the addition of velocities, the Lorentz transformations, and
the mass-energy relation. We also present a solution of the twin paradox through the
Doppler eﬀect, and its version on the cylinder. We discuss Bell’s two spaceships paradox,
and the Lorentz transformation for arbitrary velocities in one dimension.
In deriving
the mass-energy relation we show, as a by-product, that the energy of radiation suﬀers a
Doppler shift too, without having to resort to the energy-frequency relation of elementary
quantum mechanics. This will allow us to introduce the “four-momentum” of a particle
in a quite natural way. By now there is a great number of good books on the special
theory of relativity, such as French’s or Taylor and Wheeler’s [2], which usually rely on
space-time diagrams. Our approach is based solely on the Doppler eﬀect, and we believe
it can be used as a tool to understand the essence of relativity.

2 The Doppler Eﬀect

Consider a light source moving along the x axis with velocity v and emitting light of
frequency ν0, as measured in the inertial frame of the source. Let us call Isabella an
observer towards which the light source is moving to, and Marianna an observer from
which the light source is moving away. Both, Isabella and Marianna, are at rest in the
lab frame. The frequency observed by any one of them should be a function of ν0, v
(the velocity of the source, as observed by them) and c. Elementary dimensional analysis
gives ν(v) = ν0f (β), where β = v/c, and f (β) is an unknown function. From the point of
view of Isabella, if a pulse is emitted at instant t1 and a second pulse at t2, she will then
observe a wavelength given by (c − v)∆t, where ∆t = t2 − t1, and the observed frequency
is therefore ν(v). From the point of view of Marianna, we must replace v → −v, since
the light source is moving away from her. According to the postulate of the constancy of
the velocity of light, we have:

(c − v)∆tν(v) = c ,

(c + v)∆tν(−v) = c .

(2.1)

Note that we would have obtained the same equations if the observers were moving,
instead of the source, due to the ﬁrst postulate (all that matters is their relative motion).
Dividing the ﬁrst equation by the second, we obtain
1 + β
1 − β

f (β)
f (−β)

(2.2)

=

if the source and the observer move at the same
We can now use the ﬁrst postulate:
velocity v, she will clearly observe the same frequency ν0 emitted by the light source,
since they are in the same inertial frame. But according to our formula for ν(v), this
is also equal to ν0f (β)f (−β): the light observed by someone at rest in the lab frame,
between the source and the travelling observer, has frequency ν = ν0f (β), and this light
will be seeing by the moving observer to have the frequency ν′ = νf (−β). Therefore
f (β)f (−β) = 1. We can use this in (2.2), to obtain

This gives us the Doppler eﬀect formula:

f (β)2 =

1 + β
1 − β

⇒ f (β) =

1/2

1 + β
1 − β !

 

ν(v) = ν0

1/2

1 + β
1 − β !

 
There is another elementary derivation of this formula, directly from the postulates of the
STR, which we leave for appendix 1, in order not to interrupt the ﬂow of the article. We
move on now, to apply this formula to diﬀerent set-ups and obtain the main consequences
of relativistic kinematics.

3 The Addition of Velocities

The addition of velocities may be easily derived with the aid of the Doppler eﬀect formula.
Let us suppose Isabella moves with velocity v from left to right, and Marianna, who owns
a light source of frequency ν0, moves with velocity u from right to left. For simplicity
assume they are approaching each other. Both velocities are measured relative to their
father’s laboratory frame, who is in between the two. He will measure a frequency
νf = ν0((1 + u/c)/(1 − u/c))1/2 for Marianna’s light. This means that Isabella should
observe ν = νf ((1 + v/c)/(1 − v/c))1/2. But since we can write, in Isabella’s frame, that
ν = ν0((1 + w/c)/(1 − w/c))1/2, where w is the relative velocity, we have

1/2

1 − u/c
1 + u/c !

 

1 − v/c
1 + v/c !

 

1/2

=

1 − w/c
1 + w/c !

 

1/2

from which we readily derive

w =

u + v
1 + uv/c2

We will use this equation again when deriving the mass-energy relation.

(3.1)

(3.2)

4 Time Dilation

We can use the Doppler eﬀect to derive the time dilation eﬀect. While deriving the
Doppler eﬀect, we found that

(c − v)∆tν0

= c∆τ ν0 ,

(4.1)

1/2

1 + β
1 − β !

 

where the right-hand side is the velocity of light in the light-source frame, that is, the
product of the wavelength and frequency as measured by an observer that moves along
with the light source. ∆τ is the time interval between two pulses in that frame. One
obtains immediately

∆t =

∆τ
(1 − β2)1/2 ,

(4.2)

which is the time dilation eﬀect. Notice that in most elementary presentations of relativity
one derives the time dilation ﬁrst and then uses it to derive the Doppler eﬀect expression.

5 Length Contraction

Suppose now that Marianna takes oﬀ from rest, till she reaches velocity v(< c, of course)
from the origin of Isabella’s inertial frame S0, goes to a point x0 at distance L0, as
measured by Isabella, and comes back to the origin with the velocity −v, and stops at the

3

origin. Let us assume that there is a far away light source in the same line that Marianna
is moving, emitting light pulses with frequency ν0, and that Marianna’s acceleration and
deceleration times are short, compared to the total traveling time, even though this is
not crucial in the derivation, as we will see. Initially we should note that each light pulse
that passes through Marianna will necessarily reach Isabella before she comes back to the
origin, since v < c. So, if even after taking note of a given pulse, Marianna immediately
decides to go back to the origin, that pulse will reach Isabella before Marianna reaches
her. Moreover, each pulse that reaches Isabella necessarily passed through Marianna.
Therefore the number of pulses counted by Marianna is exactly the same number of
pulses counted by Isabella. Let us count how many pulses Isabella observes: the total
travel time measured by her is 2L0/v, and so the number of pulses she counts is given by
NI = ν02L0/v. In order to compute the number of pulses Marianna observes, we must use
the Doppler formula. On her way to to x0 she observes N+ = ν0((1 + β)/(1 − β))1/2L′/v.
Here we are considering that she observes the point x0 at an unknown distance L′, and
that this point moves toward her with velocity v. On her way back she will observe
N− = ν0((1 − β)/(1 + β))1/2L′/v. Note that on her way back she observes the same
distance L′ to the origin. The fact that NM = N+ + N− = NI gives

2L′/v

(1 − β2)1/2 = 2L0/v ⇒ L′ = L0(1 − β2)1/2 ,

(5.1)

which is the length contraction eﬀect 1(FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction).

6 The Twin Paradox

Incidentally this counting procedure also solves the famous “twin paradox”, or in this
case, the “sister’s paradox”: two sisters, Isabella and Marianna, are separated. Isabella
stays in an inertial frame and Marianna goes on a round trip just like the one we described.
Each one of them sees the other’s clock run slower than her own. When they meet again
who is right? According to Isabella, there where 2T ν0 pulses, and according to Marianna
there were T ′((1 + β)/(1 − β))1/2ν0 + T ′((1 − β)/(1 + β))1/2ν0. Since they observe the
same number of pulses, we must have T ′ = T (1 − β2)1/2, which means that Marianna’s
clock indeed ran slower than Isabella’s.

1If one feels uneasy with the round trip in this argument, we may provide the following variation:
when Marianna reaches x0, she has observed ν0((1 + β)/(1 − β))1/2L′/v pulses, whereas Isabella has
observed ν0L0/v pulses. The diﬀerence between these two numbers should be exactly the number of
pulses between x0 and Isabella: these are the pulses that have crossed Marianna, but not Isabella. This
number is given by ν0L0/c. Therefore we have ν0((1 + β)/(1 − β))1/2L′/v = ν0L0/v + ν0L0/c, which
gives the result (5.1) again.

4

It is also possible to use this method to derive the time diﬀerence for an arbitrary
motion. The counting argument requires only that the velocity of the traveler is al-
ways smaller than the velocity of the light. Therefore, let us consider an arbitrary
velocity function for the distant light source as a function of time v(τ ), where τ is
Marianna’s proper time. Between instants τ and τ + dτ , Marianna observes dN(τ ) =
dτ ((1 + β)/(1 − β))1/2 ν0 pulses. During the whole trip she will have observed

In the case the observer returns to the origin, the second term on the left-hand side
vanishes

since this is the total distance covered by the traveling observer. We will show this
more formally in section 10, where we discuss the Lorentz transformations for arbitrary
velocities. Therefore we obtain the more familiar looking result

Since (1 − β2)1/2 < 1, we see that T > T ′, always.

7 The Twin Paradox on a Cylinder

There is an interesting variation of the twin paradox, where one considers the space
to be a cylinder, that is, the spacial dimension is compact. The two paradoxes seem
very similar, but there is one crucial diﬀerence. In the previous paradox, ultimately, the
explanation was due to the fact that, whereas one of the observers is always receiving
pulses at the same frequency, the other observes blue-shifted and then red-shifted signals,
due to the fact that she changed her velocity in order to go back to the origin. This is
equivalent to the more usual explanation where it is pointed out that the situation is not
really symmetric, since one of the observers had to accelerate, whereas the other did not,
breaking the symmetry between the two.

In the case of a cylinder one can not use this “breaking of the symmetry” explanation.
This is so because there is more than one geodesic path that takes the traveling observer

5

back to the origin, which is always an inertial frame of reference. Therefore there is no
apparent asymmetry in this case.

We can use our counting method, similarly to what we have done in the classic
twin paradox case. Suppose Isabella and Marianna are located at the origin, and that
Marianna goes on a round trip, winding around the cylinder, which has radius R. Let us
consider a light source at distance L1 from the origin, measured in the clockwise direction,
which sends light pulses with frequency ν0. This source has been sending pulses for a
long time, and we can assume that at the beginning of Marianna’s trip, both observers
start counting pulses. We will also assume that the source is sending pulses towards the
origin along the path of length L1 until Marianna reaches it, and then the light source
will send signals along the path of length 2πR − L1. Let us count the number of pulses
in the two frames of reference.

According to Marianna, in the ﬁrst leg of her trip she observes pulses at a higher rate,

given by

where τ1 is the time she takes to reach the light source. On her way back to the origin,
light is observed at a lower rate, and the number of pulses is simply given by

where now τ2 is the time Marianna takes to go back to the origin. The total number of
pulses that Marianna has counted is

According to Isabella we have the following. Let T1 (T2) be the time Marianna takes
to reach the light source (reach the origin from the light source). During the ﬁrst leg of
Marianna’s trip, Isabella observes T1ν0, but in order that their counting matches, that
is, they count the same physical pulses emitted from the source, we have to add all the
pulses that are between Isabella and the source, at the time Marianna reached it, which
is equal to L1ν0/c. This gives

During the second leg of Marianna’s trip, each pulse that she counts crosses her and
reaches Isabella before she reaches the origin, and each pulse counted by Isabella neces-
sarily crosses Marianna. We are assuming that Marianna takes a time T2 to arrive at

Isabella will have to wait a time equal to L2/c to start receiving pulses. This gives

and the total number of pulses counted by Isabella is given by

Picking L1 = L2 gives, by symmetry τ1 = τ2 = τ /2 and T1 = T2 = T /2, where τ and T
are the times of how long the round trip takes according to each observer. Substituting
these in (7.6) and (7.3) we obtain

which is the same conclusion as in the classic twin paradox 2.

In this analysis we see how useful the “counting approach” is. Whereas in the usual
solutions of the twin paradox in a cylinder one needs to do quite involved arguments, in
this case one hardly sees any diﬀerence between the analysis of the classical twin paradox
and this one.

The reader may still feel a little uneasy, in the search for the hidden asymmetry
between the two systems of reference. In this case one can convince oneself by noticing
the following: one of the observers is always receiving pulses at frequency ν0, whereas
the other one sees a higher frequency during one leg and a lower frequency during the
other. We can see, then, that ultimately, the reason for the asymmetry between the two
observers is that there’s a preferred global inertial frame [5, 6, 7].

8 Bell’s Two Spaceship Paradox

J. Bell has presented a quite interesting paradox in the special theory of relativity, which
has caused (and apparently it still causes!) heated debate among physicists. The paradox
is explained in his book [8], and we summarize it here. Suppose two spaceships, I and
M, are at rest in a given inertial frame, separated by a distance L0, as measured in the
lab frame, and suppose that an observer, located exactly at the midpoint joining the
two spaceships, emits a light signal towards them, which serves as a signal for them to
start their trip. Each spaceship is equipped with a program that tells the crew how to

2If we take L1 6= L2, equation (7.3) changes to N m = τ (1 + β(L1 − L2)/L)/(1 − β2)1/2, since, by
symmetry, τ1/τ2 = L1/L2, and equation (7.6) becomes N i = T (1 + β(L1 − L2)/L), where we used that
T = (L1 + L2)/v, and we get the same result as (7.7).

7

accelerate it, and the programs in I and M are exactly the same. The ﬁrst question is:
will the distance between the two spaceships be Lorentz-contracted according to the lab
frame? The answer to this question is, clearly, ‘no. The second question is, and here is
the apparent paradox: if there was a thin thread joining the two spaceships, then, since
the measurement in the lab frame gives L0 for their separation, then how come the thread
should be Lorentz-contracted according to, say, the observers in I? In other words, if the
measurement in the lab frame gives L0, then the length of the thread as measured by
the spaceships should be bigger than L0, in order to compensate the Lorentz contraction.
There is something clearly wrong in this conclusion.

To answer the second question consider the following: if we observe, in the lab frame,
that their distance is L0, then in I’s frame their distance should be bigger than L0, but
since I and M have exactly the same velocity programs, one could be lead to think
that their distance should be constant according to them. This is where the solution of
the paradox stems, and can be easily understood by recalling one of the fundamental
aspects of relativity: simultaneity is not an absolute concept. The lab measurement of
the positions of the two spaceships occurs at a given time t in the lab frame, but this is not
the case in the spaceship’s frames. Let us denote the measurements of the positions of the
I and M spaceships, in the lab frame, by events EI and EM . The corresponding events,
as seen by the I frame are denoted by E 1
I and E 1
M . At the moment that a measurement is
performed at I, what are the locations in space-time of events E 1
I and E 1
M ? We postpone
this to section 11, where we ﬁnd the Lorentz tranformation for an arbitrary motion.

9 The Lorentz Transformation

We can also derive the Lorentz transformation of coordinates, using a variation of these
counting arguments. Let us suppose that in the inertial frame S0 there is an observer,
Isabella, at the origin of S0. A second inertial frame, S, where Marianna is, moves along
the x axis with velocity v. A given physical event E will have coordinates (x, t) according
to Isabella, and coordinates (x′, t′) according to Marianna. The relation between these
coordinates is given by the Lorentz transformation.

Let us suppose that there is a light source that has been emitting light for a long time,
and that it is located very far away, in such a way that there are light pulses passing
through the origin of S0 since before t = 0 (which we assume is when both origins
coincide). We will take as the physical event E, the crossing of a light pulse at x at time
t. When this happens, Isabella has already observed tν0 pulses, and there are ν0x/c pulses
between her and x, totaling N1 = (t + x/c)ν0 pulses. According to Marianna, though,
she has counted t′((1 + β)/(1 − β))1/2ν0 pulses, and there are ((1 + β)/(1 − β))1/2ν0x′/c

8

pulses between her and the physical location of E, totaling N2 = t′((1 + β)/(1 −β))1/2ν0 +
((1 + β/(1 − β))1/2ν0x′/c pulses 3. The two numbers N1 and N2 have to be equal, which
gives the following equation

separated by a distance L0, and that occur at the same time t according to Isabella.
Assuming that Marianna also observes simultaneous physical events (that is, that ∆t′ = 0
for her too), we would have that the distance between E1 and E2 is given by ∆x =
L0(1 − β2)1/2, and so (9.1) implies

L0

(1 + β) =

which is true only if β = 0: Isabella and Marianna must be at rest in relation to each
other. This is the end of absolute simultaneity.

In order to ﬁnd the Lorentz transformation for x and t we still need one more equation.
Suppose, then, that another event E ′ takes place at (−x, t) according to Isabella, and
that Marianna moves with velocity −v. What are the coordinates of E ′ according to
Marianna? They are simply given by (−x′, t′), since all we have done was to perform a
parity transformation 4, and so we can write

10 The Lorentz Transformation for Arbitrary Veloc-

ities

Usually one thinks of the STR as a theory that deals with inertial frames only, where
acceleration has no place. This is not correct, and there are, indeed, transformation laws
for the coordinates from a frame in arbitrary motion to a given inertial frame (the “lab
frame”). These were found by Nelson in ([9]), and we derive here their one-dimensional
version.

Consider two systems of coordinate in a similar way as done in section 9, where we
derived the Lorentz transformations. The diﬀerence now is that Marianna’s velocity can
depend on time in an arbitrary way. At t = t′ = 0 their origins coincide, and they
are receiving light pulses from a distant light source. Consider a physical event E that
happens at some point in space-time. Let us count how many light pulses are there
between the ﬁrst pulse, that deﬁned the t = t′ = 0 instant, and the pulse that crossed
the event E. According to Isabella, there are

are x′/λ = x′ν(t′)/c. Integrating (10.2) from 0 to t′ and adding x′ν(t′)/c we get the total

spond to γ(τ )cβ(τ )dτ in Marianna’s coordinates, and the ﬁnal portion, which according

It is not easy to invert equations (10.5) and (10.6), except in a few cases, such as in
the hyperbolic motion. It is straightforward to see that these transformations reduce to
Lorentz transformation in the case β is constant.

It is instructive to apply these transformations to the case of hyperbolic motion, and
use it to solve Bell’s paradox. Before doing that, it is convenient to parametrize the
velocity as v = c tanh(φ), where φ is an arbitrary function of the proper time. The
Lorentz transformation becomes

The uniform acceleration problem is instructive. In this case φ = aτ /c, where a is the
acceleration measured in a frame of reference where the spaceship is instantenously at
rest.

In general one approaches this problem by ﬁnding the coordinate x′, in I’s frame, of
the M spaceship, in order to see that it is, indeed, pulling apart. We will do the opposite
here: given that M is at a certain spacetime point, which characterizes a physical event
E, with coordinates (x, t) according to the lab frame, what are it’s coordinates in I’s
frame? As we will see, the computations are much simpler in this case.

In the lab we have, for the spaceship M,

The coordinates of a physical event are, in I’s coordinates, (x′, τ ′), which are connected
to the lab coordinates by



xM = αc(cosh(τ /α) − 1) + L0
ctM = αc sinh(τ /α)

x = (x′ + αc) cosh(τ ′/α) − αc
ct = (x′ + αc) sinh(τ ′/α)

It is easy to see that, from (10.8) and (10.9) we obtain

sinh(τ ′/α) =

(α2c2 + L2

0 + 2αcL0 cosh(τ /α)

from which we can extract the asymptotic behaviour exp(τ ′/α) ≈ (αc/L0)1/2 exp(τ /2α)
and x′ ≈ (αcL0)1/2 exp(τ /2α) ≈ L0 exp(τ ′/2α). We see, then, that the spaceship M
distances itself from I, which is, essentially due to the failure of simultaneity.

11 The Mass Energy Relation

Finally, let us derive the mass-energy relation. Consider a body of mass M that emits two
bundles of radiation in opposite directions, each bundle carries an energy equal to δE/2.
By symmetry the body will stay put. Before we proceed, let us make an observation
concerning the linear momentum of the body and of the radiation.

We will assume that momentum and energy are conserved, and that the momentum of
the body is given by P = ξ(v/c)Mv, based on dimensional grounds. Moreover, noticing
that as v → −v we should have P → −P , we deduce that ξ(v/c) = ξ(−v/c). Since
as v → 0, P = Mv, we also have ξ(0) = 1. These conditions imply that ξ(v/c) =
1 + α(v/c)2 + ..., so that, whatever the relativistic momentum is, it equals Mv up to
factors of third order in v/c. Since in the following we will be looking at factors up to
second order only, we may use P = Mv.

We will also be using the fact that the linear momentum carried by a bundle of radia-
tion of energy δE is δE/c. This relation preceeds the mass-energy relation and is usually
derived [3] using conservation of total momentum (mechanical and electromagnetic) but
does not assume an explicit form for the linear momentum.5

Let us analyse this is a frame that moves with velocity −v along the same line as
the emitted radiation as shown in ﬁgure 1. In this frame, the energy of each bundle will

change, and, since the body was at rest in the original frame, it will be moving with
velocity v in the second frame. If its mass is M ′ now, then the linear momentum of the
body is M ′v.

In order to account the momentum carried by the radiation we have to ﬁnd the
expression for the energy of the radiation bundles in the “moving” frame. In principle we

expression d~p/dt = q( ~E + v × ~B), which is relativistic, not manifestly, though.

could use the quantum relation that states that to a photon of energy E corresponds the
frequency ν = E/h, and, by applying the Doppler formula, ﬁnd E′ = E((1+β)/(1−β))1/2.
This is correct, of course, but has one aspect that is less than satisfactory: the special
theory of relativity is a completely classical theory, in the sense that its starting point is
Maxwell’s equations, and therefore we should not resort to any quantum relations in order
to derive its results. Moreover, it is not obvious at all that the two theories could be put
together in a simple and as direct manner as it is done in general, after all, why should
these two theories be compatible? Therefore, instead of using quantum mechanics, we
will take a somewhat longer route, but which is more elementary, and has the advantage
of not appealing to quantum relations.

Using dimensional analysis, we can write an expression for the transformation of the
energy of a bundle of radiation from one inertial frame to another, that moves with
velocity u in relation to it: it is simply E′ = Ef (β), where f (β) is an unknown universal
function, and β = u/c. This function must satisfy a composition law. Consider three
inertial frames, S1, S2 and S3, such that S2 moves with velocity v with relation to
S1, and S3 moves with velocity u with relation to S2. Suppose there is a bundle of
radiation in S1 with energy E1, then we must have E3 = E2f (u/c) = E1f (v/c)f (u/c)
and E3 = E1f ((u/c + v/c)/(1 + uv/c2)), where Ei is the energy of the radiation measured
in Si, and we have used the formula for the addition of velocities. This means that:

It is not diﬃcult to solve this equation, and we ﬁnd (see appendix 2) that

f (u/c)f (v/c) = f

u/c + v/c
1 + uv/c2

!

 

f (u/c) =

a/2

1 + u/c
1 − u/c !

 

where a is a constant. Later we will show that a = 1.

Proceeding with our argument, we can compute the momentum carried by light in
the moving frame. Denoting by δE± the pulses that move to the right and to the left,
we obtain

δE± =

This is not quite the ﬁnal result, since we still need to ﬁx a, which will done by using
energy conservation. Once again, we can write the total energy of the body as U(M, v) =
η(v/c)Mc2 based on dimensional grounds. The function η(v/c) should be such that, to
second order in v/c, the diﬀerence in energy of a body of mass M at rest and the same
body with velocity v should be the kinectic energy, that is η(v/c) − η(0) = (v/c)2/2. And
since the energy should not depend on the direction of the velocity, η(v/c) = η(−v/c),
and therefore η(v/c) = η0 + (v/c)2/2 + o((v/c)4).

Let us look at the energy conservation in both frames of reference. In the lab frame

we have

U(M, 0) = U(M ′, 0) + δE

(11.6)

whereas in the moving frame we have, up to second order in (v/c)2,

U(M, v) = U(M ′, v) + δE+ + δE− ⇒ U(M, 0) +

(11.7)
Equations (11.6) and (11.7) imply that (M − M ′)v2/2 = a2δEβ2, which together with
(11.5), ﬁxes a = 1, and establishes the well-known mass-energy relation

δE = (M − M ′)c2

(11.8)

Before closing this section, let us ﬁnd the exact forms of the functions ξ(v/c) and η(v/c).
Let us ﬁnd η(v/c) ﬁrst.

Suppose the body emits two bundles of radiation with the same energy, to the left and
right, each with energy δE. After this emission the mass of the body is M ′ = M − δE/c2.
In the lab frame we have from energy conservation, U(M, 0) = U(M ′, 0) + δE/2 + δE/2,
while in the moving frame we have U(M, v) = U(M ′, v) + δE+ + δE−, and therefore

(11.9)

which implies that η(v/c) = γ, and the energy is given by U(M, v) = γMc2.

Finally, for momentum we have, following a setup similar to the one just described,
before the emission of radiation, P = ξ(v/c)Mv, and after ξ(v/c)M ′v + δE+/c − δE−/c,
which gives

ξ(v/c)Mv = ξ(v/c)M ′v +

which ﬁxes the function ξ(v/c) = γ. Note that we can write these expressions in terms of
the derivatives of t and x with respect to the proper time of the particle τ , since dt/dτ = γ.

We are then led naturally to the deﬁnition of the ‘four-momentum’ (in this case the ‘two-
momentum’) P µ = (P 0, P 1), with P 0 = U/c = Md(ct)/dτ and P 1 = P = Mdx/dτ ,
which are expressed in terms of the four-velocity by P µ = Mdxµ/dτ .

These two relations can be used as the starting point to the study of relativistic

dynamics. This completes our discussion of special relativity.

12 Conclusions

We have derived all relativistic kinematics, taking the Doppler eﬀect as the starting
point. The novelty in this presentation is that we derive the Doppler eﬀect directly from
the relativity postulates, and from there obtain everything else: time dilation, length
contraction, addition of velocities, Lorentz transformations for constant velocity and for
arbitrary velocities, the mass-energy relation, and the introduction of relativistic energy
and momentum for a massive body. We also used it to explain the “twin paradox”. Our
approach is particularly useful in the discussion of the twin paradox on a cylinder. In
deriving the mass-energy relation we used only fairly general arguments, staying always
in the realm of elementary classical physics: we did not use the energy/frequency relation
for photons from quantum mechanics, nor used the classical expression of a wave packet
in terms of electromagnetic ﬁelds, to derive the fact that the energy will also be Doppler
shifted. We should stress the fact that, in deriving the relativistc energy and momentum,
we assumed that there are conserved quantities like energy and momentum, and that
light interacts with matter in such a way that all energy can be absorbed or emitted.

Another feature of this approach is that all arguments presented are truly one-
dimensional: we did not use light rays moving perpendicularly to its motion, for example,
as is done in some elementary presentations of the special theory of relativity.

Appendix 1

In this appendix we present another elementary derivation of the Doppler eﬀect. Suppose
that Isabella is in an inertial frame of reference, and that she is sending light pulses at a
frequency ν0, and that Marianna is moving towards her with a mirror. As explained in
the paper, she will observe pulses at frequency ν1 = f (β)ν0, and since her mirror reﬂects
them, this is equivalent to her carrying a light source sending pulses at frequency ν1.
Finally, Isabella will observe pulses at a frequency ν2 = f (β)ν1 = f (β)2ν0.

Let us analyze two sequential pulses reﬂecting from Mariannas mirror, call them
“pulse-1” and “pulse-2”, as seen in Isabellas frame. Let the distance between these two
pulses be λ0. It is easy to see that pulse-2 hits the mirror a time ∆t after pulse-1, given
by

During this time interval, pulse-1 has traveled c∆t and the mirror has traveled v∆t,
therefore the distance between the two pulses, which is the wave length measured by
Isabella, is given by

Now we use the constancy of the speed of light: we know that λ0ν0 = c and that λν2 = c,
which imply

(c − v)∆tν = (c + v)∆tν0 ⇒ ν =

c + v
c − v

ν0

and therefore

c∆t + v∆t = λ0 .

λ = (c − v)∆t .

Appendix 2

We want to solve the functional equation

f (u/c)f (v/c) = f

u + v
1 + uv/c2

 

!

Let us take u/c arbitrary and v/c inﬁnitesimal, equal to ǫ. Expanding both sides of (2.1)
in Taylor series, we obtain

f (u/c)(f (0)+ǫa+. . .) = f ((u/c+ǫ)(1−ǫu/c2)) = f (u/c)+ǫf ′(u/c)(1−u2/c2)+. . . (2.2)

where we introduced a = f ′(0), and can set f (0) = 1 for physical reasons: if the observer
is at rest with the light source, then the energy measured by the observer should be the
same as the one emitted. This expansion gives us the elementary diﬀerential equation

This can be easily solved, and we obtain

f ′(u/c) =

af (u/c)
1 − u2/c2

f (u/c) =

If the reader feels this is a little too involved, or would rather avoid the use of calculus,
there is another derivation we can provide 6. Replace v/c by tanh(x), and u/c by tanh(y),
and deﬁne g(x) = ln f (tanh(x)). Equation (2.1) becomes

g(x) + g(y) = g(x + y)

(2.5)

whose solution is trivially seen to be g(x) = ax, or, equivalently, f (tanh(x)) = ax, which
is easy to show to be the same as (2.4).

per, but we found it could be useful to have an alternative way to derive the Lorentz
transformation, using time dilation and length contraction as the starting point.

Initially, let us call the laboratory frame S, and an inertial frame moving with velocity
v along the x direction, S0. We want to ﬁnd the transformation law of the coordinates
(x0, t0) of a given physical “event” E0 in S0, to the coordinates (x, t) of this same event, as
observed in S (and which we refer to as E). We assume that (x0, t0) = (0, 0) corresponds
to (x, t) = (0, 0).

In order to ﬁnd this transformation law, let us assume that at the same time and
position of E0, a light ﬂash was emitted. This light ﬂash will arrive at the origin of S0 at
time t0 + x0/c. Due to the time dilation formula, this corresponds to time γ(t0 + x0/c)
as measured in S, where γ−1 = (1 − β2)
2 . In order to ﬁnd the time the event E took
place when measured in S, we have to “roll the ﬁlm backwards”. Since the light arrived
at the origin of S0 at time (measured in S) γ(t0 + x0/c), it means that it left the event
E at time γ(t0 + x0/c) − γ−1x0/(c + v): we have to subtract the time light takes to cover
the distance γ−1x0 to the origin, as the origin moves with velocity v. This gives:

t = γ(t0 +

x0
c

) − γ−1 x0
c + v

⇒ t =

t0 + βx0/c
(1 − β2)1/2

(3.1)

We can perform a similar argument to obtain the transformation law for the spatial
coordinate. At the time light from the event E0 arrives at the origin of S0, the origin
itself has traveled a distance vγ−1(t0 + x0/c), according to S. We have to subtract from
this value the distance traveled by the origin of S0 during the time light is going from
E to the origin of S0, which is given by vγ−1x0/(c + v), and add the length contracted
distance γ−1x0. This gives

x = vγ(t +

Equations (3.2) and (3.1) are the Lorentz transformation of coordinates for one dimen-
sional relativistic motion.

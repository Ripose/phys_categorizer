ABSTRACT
The European programs for development of supersonic air-ﬂights involve new studies on the human perception of sonic
boom. Because this noise includes high-level components at very low-frequency, the usual psycho-acoustic tests with
headphones are not relevant; instead, the original sound-ﬁeld can be reproduced with many loudspeakers in a small
room, but the loudspeakers must be controlled for an accurate reproduction, both in time and space, in an area large
enough to enclose a listener’s head. In this paper, Active Noise Control is applied to sonic boom reproduction through
Boundary Surface Control (as named by S.Ise) of the acoustic pressure around a listener. A small room was built
at LMA with sixteen powerful low-frequency acoustic sources in the walls. Frequency and time-domain numerical
simulations of sonic boom reproduction in this room are given, including a sensitivity study of the coupling between
a listener’s head and the incident sonic boom wave which combine into the effective sound-ﬁeld to be reproduced.

1. INTRODUCTION
Most of the time, when the disturbance induced by some industrial or transport noises has to be evaluated, psycho-
acoustic tests are conducted through sound reproduction using headphones. However, in some cases, tests with head-
phones are not relevant because of spectral or spatial speciﬁcities of the soundﬁeld to be reproduced. Sonic boom is
such a very special noise: it is very loud (120 dB is a common level for this type of sound), and most of its energy is
localized at very low frequencies, down to 2 or 3 Hz. Headphones could reproduce such a pressure at the eardrums
of a listener, but it is expected that the perception of such a very low frequency sound does not only depend on the
pressure ﬂuctuation at the listener’s ear, but also at the whole listener’s body, especially on his or her torso. Moreover,
headphones do not replicate accurately the noise at the eardrums if the listener’s own Head Related Transfer Functions
(HRTF) are not included in the audio reproduction device. The sound image reproduced using headphones also moves
with the listener’s head, whereas slight rotations of the head in front of a ﬁxed source are known to be an important
factor in the source localization. Therefore, a soundﬁeld reproduction technique is needed that works in an area large
enough to enclose a person and to let him or her move slightly. The reproduction technique should also not depend on
the physiognomy of the listener.

Because of the above drawbacks of sound reproduction using headphones, a Boundary Surface Control (BSC)
technique [1], as named by S.Ise, has been chosen to perform indoor sonic boom reproduction at the LMA. This
paper presents the preliminary work that has been conducted to that purpose. Firstly, the soundﬁeld reproduction is
formulated as an Active Noise Control (ANC) problem, and the theory underlying Boundary Surface Control is brieﬂy
introduced. Numerical simulations of soundﬁeld reconstructions are then presented and discussed. Finally, the results
of a study on the inﬂuence of the listener’s presence upon the system performances are shown.

2. SOUND REPRODUCTION USING ANC
The simplest ANC set-up includes a single acoustic source cancelling the noise measured by a single microphone. If
d denotes the disturbance signal and y the signal produced by the secondary source, the usual ANC problem is the
minimization of the error signal e = d + y. The nearer y is to −d, the better is the control performance.

Therefore, cancelling a primary noise amounts to reproducing it and inverting its phase. The ANC problem can be
transposed into a sound reproduction problem simply by denoting d the sound to be reproduced and y the reproduced
sound, the error being e = d − y. This remains true whether the control ﬁlter is adaptive or not, and for the single-
channel as well as for the multi-channel case where d, y and e are signals vectors. This means that any active noise

control device can perform sound reproduction. All the techniques, algorithms and hardware that have been developed
for ANC can be used for sound reproduction.

In this paper, the sound reproduction is formulated as an ANC problem because of two features of ANC systems
which are not present in usual reproduction techniques such as stereophony and 5.1 sound reproduction, nor in more
advanced techniques such as Wave Field Synthesis [2]: ANC devices very often rely on the monitoring of error signals
which directly measures the system performances, and they make use of adaptive ﬁltering. These two features are
of importance for an accurate sound reproduction: adaptive ﬁltering can reduce the sound reproduction sensitivity to
temperature changes or to a listener’s presence; the inclusion of error signals in the reproduction process means that
direct information about noise propagation is available. No a priori assumptions have to be made about the reproduc-
tion area, an accurate and adaptive reproduction can be achieved even in a room at low-frequency. Furthermore, the
prediction of the primary noise, which requires a feedforward reference signal for control of broadband non-stationary
noise, is not a problem in sound reproduction. The signal d, which has to be reproduced, must have been recorded or
computed in advance so that it is available as a convenient reference signal. Moreover, it is possible to make use of
this reference signal with a time advance as long as required in order to make causal the inversion of the secondary
path matrix which is required for an accurate sound reproduction.

3. BOUNDARY SURFACE CONTROL
For psycho-acoustic tests, a soundﬁeld reproduction must be performed over a 3D area which must be large enough
to surround the listener’s head. This means that, from one hand, many sensors and actuators are required. On the
other hand loudspeakers and microphones cannot be placed too close to the listener, otherwise the tests would be
uncomfortable for him or her. The sound reproduction quality could also decrease in this case, due to the stronger
inﬂuence of his or her presence on the soundﬁeld to be reproduced (see part 5).

Fortunately, sound reproduction, as well as noise cancellation, can be performed inside a 3D volume by controlling
noise only at the boundary surface of the volume. To this purpose, Furuya et al. proposed in 1990 a method called
Boundary Pressure Control, and, in the 90’s, Ise suggested a substitute method called Boundary Surface Control [1].
Several other versions of the technique have then been presented [3]. As it is denoted by its name, BSC aims at
controlling the pressure in a volume by monitoring noise at its boundary surface. It is justiﬁed by the Kirchhoff-
Helmoltz integral expression of the acoustic pressure inside a bounded volume:

p(r) =

¶ p(s)
¶ n
where p(r) is the sound pressure at a point r of the volume W
, n the unit vector
which is normal to the surface and G the Green function of Helmholtz equation in free ﬁeld. This equation shows
that pressure at an interior point only depends on pressure and its normal derivative on the exterior surface. The idea
of BSC is therefore to control these values in the same way as for multi-channel ANC, e.g. to impose some pressure
values on a group of error microphones placed all over the boundary of the control region.

The Boundary Pressure Control method relies on the fact that the some redundant information can be found in the

right hand side of the equation (1). Indeed, the limit of equation (1) for r tending to a point s0 of S

is:

In addition to Eq. (1), Eq. (2) shows that surface pressure normal derivative can be seen as a function of the pressure
on the surface. This means that ensuring the right pressure value on S gives the desired soundﬁeld in any point inside
the control region.

Several problems have been raised concerning the BPC and BSC methods. The ﬁrst problem is that the integral in
the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz equation is a continuous function of the space variable on the surface, which implies that the
sound pressure at point r depends on an inﬁnite number of pressure values. Monitoring the pressure at a ﬁnite number
of locations for control implicitly relies on the discretization of the integral in equation (1). In practice it is not possible
to control the pressure at more than a few dozen different points, which imposes a limitation on the sound reproduction
frequency range [4]. A second problem occurs for BPC at the eigenfrequencies of the internal Dirichlet problem in
, where the solution of equation (2) is not unique [3]. This means that, at the volume eigenfrequencies, both the
acoustic pressure and its normal derivative are theoretically needed for the interior sounﬁeld to be fully controlled.

Only BSC, which a priori requires twice as many sensors as BPC, is supposed to work at the eigenfrequencies of the
inner volume. However numerical simulations showed that a slight dissimetry in a mesh of pressure sensors on the
boundary surface could be sufﬁcient for ensuring control of the noise inside the volume through control of only the
pressure at the boundary (see Ref.[1] and [3]); the discretization of equation (2) using an irregular mesh could lead to
a discretized problem with a unique solution. Finally, a few pressure gradient sensors or a few pressure sensors in the
volume can be used for BPC in addition to the pressure sensors, which is the equivalent in the context of ANC of the
CHIEF method implemented for computation of acoustic ﬁelds using a Boundary Element Method [5].

Because no experimental work has been reported on the failure of BPC at the inner volume eigenfrequencies, BPC
has been chosen to perform sonic boom reproduction at LMA. One of the aims of the numerical simulations below
is to determine if the theoretical control singularity at the eigenfrequencies is a real limitation to the use of control of
pressure only.

4. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF INDOOR SONIC BOOM REPRODUCTION
In order to reproduce the noise generated on the ground by a supersonic aircraft, a reproduction room has been built
at the LMA, Marseilles, including sixteen powerful low-frequency acoustic sources in the walls. The sources were
designed to reproduce the high low-frequency pressure levels that can be measured in real conditions. Each source
includes two large loudspeakers driven with out-of-phase signals so that the ﬁrst distorsion harmonic is minimized. A
simple model of the room and the noise sources has been elaborated for numerical simulations of the sound reproduc-
tion.

A. Modelling of the Reproduction Room
Several simpliﬁcation hypothesis have been made for modelling the reproduction room. The room is assumed to be a
perfect 3m x 2m x 2.1m parallelepiped so that the modal behaviour of the room can be easily written as a sum of cosine
functions. The absorbing properties of the walls are included in the model through a constant real normal admittance,
which leads to modal damping proportional to frequency [4]. Acoustic sources are considered as omnidirectionnal
monopoles. Finally, it is assumed that the cavity is airtight, i.e. there is no acoustic leakage.

Using these assumptions, the pressure radiated by a monopole source at a measurement point can be written as
a simple modal series. For the simulation this series was restricted to the ﬁrst thousand eigenmodes. This number
has been found sufﬁcient to describe the acoustical paths in the room at low frequencies (below 500Hz), which is the
frequency range for which it is intended to reproduce accurately the sonic boom soundﬁeld.

The Boundary Pressure Control method requires the meshing of the surface enclosing the volume where sound
reproduction is intended. For the simulations a cylindrical mesh was considered, which is adequate for enclosing a
listener during psycho-acoustic tests. The cylinder includes 32 microphones/nodes, and has a 60 cm radius and a

3

60 cm height, as displayed on ﬁgures 1a and 1b. The microphones are supposed to be perfectly omnidirectionnal for
the simulations.

B. Frequency-Domain Simulations
In the frequency domain, pressure values and acoustic paths can be described by single complex coefﬁcients. The
acoustic pressure ﬁeld which has to be reproduced at the error microphones can be written as a complex vector
p0
M. Let p0
P denote the noise that has to be reproduced inside the control volume at some observation points. At a
given frequency, if HSM and HSP respectively denote the transfer matrix from the secondary sources to the control
microphones, and from the sources to the observation point, the optimal vector of source command signal is:

q = H

−1
SMp0
M

(3)

The reproduced soundﬁeld pressure at the observation points is then given by:

pP = HSPq = HSPH−1
Note that these computations are similar to the derivation of optimal noise cancellation: the reconstruction error at the
microphones only depends on the source-to-microphone transfer matrix inversion.

The ﬁrst soundﬁeld whose reproduction is evaluated through numerical simulations is an harmonic plane wave.

observe the soundﬁeld over the whole reproduction room. The height of the observation points corresponds to the
middle of the cylinder on the surface of which the acoustic pressure is controlled. After computing the input to the
control source, the pressure error vector can be computed by the following formula:

e(x, y) = 100

pr(x, y) − po(x, y)
po(x, y)

(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)

(cid:12)

where pr and po are respectively the reproduced and original pressure values at the (x, y) point. The obtained value
e is then in percents. Equal sound pressure error contours are then displayed for harmonic plane waves at 100, 200
and 300 Hz on ﬁgure 2. It can be seen that, as expected, the performance of the sound reproduction system decreases
as the frequency of the original sound wave increases. This can easily be explained by the fact that the density of
microphones per wavelength on the control surface decreases as the frequency increases. The microphones surface
density D is given by:

where n is the number of error microphones and S the surface of the cylinder in squared meters. If S is a number of l
by l squares, where l

is the wavelength of the original sound, then we have

(5)

(6)

(7)

where c is the sound speed and f the fequency. The number of error microphones for each l by l
square decreases
as a f −2 function, and so does the sound reproduction accuracy. This can be seen as a generalization of a frequently
observed result in ANC, which is that three sensors by wavelength are necessary to ensure an efﬁcient control along a
one-dimensional microphone antenna (see Ref. [4],[6]).

In order to observe more accurately the inﬂuence of the primary wave frequency on the system performance, ﬁg-
ure 3 displays the relative pressure error, averaged on a few dozens of regularly spaced points inside the cylinder where
control is intended. It can be seen that the reproduction error behaves as a f 2 function, it is inversely proportionnal
to the error microphones surface density Dl of the error microphones, which conﬁrms the signiﬁcance of D as an
indicator of the reproduction accuracy.

In the case of a cylindrical volume with radius 60 cm and height 60 cm, the ﬁrst eigenfrequency of the Dirichlet
problem for the internal volume takes place at about 283 Hz, which is within the range of the intended soundﬁeld
reproduction. It can be seen in ﬁgure 3 that no error peak can be observed around this frequency, which means
that the soundﬁeld reproduction through Boundary Pressure Control does not suffer from deﬁciencies at this cylinder
eigenfrequency. The eigenfrequencies of higher order are out of the frequency range of the system.

Although the reproduction error increases quickly with the frequency, ﬁgures 4 shows that the phase of the sec-
ondary wave is quite well reproduced even for large values of f . This suggests that, even if for one frequency value
the amplitude of the pressure is not perfectly reproduced inside the control region, the crossing of a transient sound,
for instance from the left to the right, can be reproduced so that a listener perceives the direction where the sound is
coming from, because an accurate phase reconstruction involves for the listener a good reproduction of the Interaural
Time Difference, which is known to be the main cue for the localization of noise sources in an horizontal plane at low
frequency.

C. Time-Domain Simulations
The sonic boom is a very unstationnary noise and, for psycho-acoustic tests, the reproduction of the transient noise
components must also be accurate. Therefore time-domain simulations are required in addition to frequency-domain
simulations, all the more since effective audio reproduction systems work in the time-domain.

Firstly, the matrix of secondary paths from noise sources to error microphones, which has been computed for
a dense grid of discrete frequencies, gives the corresponding impulse response matrix by using Inverse Fast Fourier
Transform. The impulse response for the inverse of the matrix of secondary paths is also computed through IFFT.
Once these direct and inverse responses have been obtained, the computation of the residual error is made as in the
frequency-domain, with the difference that the products become convolution products. The secondary ﬁeld is the sum
of the soundﬁeld from each source, each one being calculated by ﬁltering the original signals with the appropriate
ﬁlters.

In a ﬁrst step, simulations were performed for gaussian pulse plane waves, which are the signals with maximum

7

localization in both time and frequency. The visualization plane is the same as in the previous simulations. This gives,
for each time sample, a map of the original and reproduced sound pressures in the observation plane, which is this time
divided in 32 by 16 points. Excerpts of the results are presented on ﬁgures 5 and 6 for plane gaussian pulse waves with
center frequency 100 and 200 Hz. The time-domain reconstruction of the original wave is very accurate for a 100 Hz
pulse, and still quite accurate for the 200 Hz one in almost the whole controlled region, although the frequency-domain
simulations suggested a 20 to 30 % error at this frequency. The results observed in the frequency domain for the phase
reproduction are conﬁrmed, the secondary wavelet travels through the room very like the original one.

In a second step we simulated the reconstruction of a recorded real sonic boom. Because of the frequency limita-
tions of the system, the recorded sound was low-pass ﬁltered in order to remove the signal components at frequencies
higher than 300 Hz. The results are presented on ﬁgure 7 for an observation point placed at the center of the control
region. Once again, the original soundwave is very well reproduced, even if a slight variation of the secondary pressure
around the original value can be observed. When listening the two signals with headphones the difference is almost
inaudible.

D. Conclusions
Frequency and time-domain simulations of indoor soundﬁeld reconstruction in the LMA reproduction room have
been performed. These simulations correspond to an ideal case, where the inverse ﬁlters are the optimal ones. Thus,
the obtained results cannot be considered as the real performances of the system in practice but as the maximal
performances that can be expected.
In practice the control ﬁlters will be Finite Impulse Response ﬁlters and the
reproduced soundﬁeld may not be as close to the original sonic boom ﬁeld as the simulations suggest.

However, the simulation results are encouraging enough in implementing sonic boom reproduction through

5. INFLUENCE OF LISTENER’S PRESENCE ON THE SOUNDFIELD
When a soundwave, such as a sonic boom one, impings a listener, it is diffracted by his or her body, depending on
what is the wave propagation direction and what are the shape and reﬂective properties of the body. In particular, it is
known that the structures of the head and ear pinnae inﬂuence the properties of the sound measured at the ear drum.
Therefore, each listener hears a different sound, and the soundﬁeld to reproduce on control microphones around a
listener by a BPC system is not only the single incident sound wave, but the sum of the diffracted and direct waves.
Thus, an effective sound reproduction requires the presence of the listener during both the recording and reproduction
stages, just as in the case of the use of binaural techniques involving HRTF.

However, since the recording microphones are more distant to the listener, his or her inﬂuence on the recorded
soundﬁeld is expected to be lower than in the binaural case. There is therefore a compromise to ﬁnd between a lower
listener inﬂuence on the soundﬁeld and a lower maximum reproduction frequency, because the more distant are the
microphones from the person, the lower are the surface density of sensors and the reproduction accuracy. Moreover,

since the amplitude of the diffracted pressure depends on the frequency of the incident wave (more precisely on
the ratio between the wavelength and the characteristic dimensions of the diffractive object), it is probable that the
difference between the direct and undirect soundwaves is very tight for low frequencies. For example, for lower
frequencies under 340 Hz, the wavelength is more than 1 m, whereas a common diameter for human head is 17 cm.

Therefore a few questions need to be answered before implementing BPC for reproducing sonic boom around a
listener. Firstly, are the soundﬁelds recorded around two different persons very different? How does this difference de-
pend on the control microphones distance and on the incident wave frequency? How accurate is the reproduction when
the pressure ﬁeld recorded around a listener A is reproduced around a listener B? Finally, is it possible to reconstruct
the sonic boom around a person by reproducing only the single incident soundwave at the control microphones?

A. Simulations
In order to answer these different questions, a few numerical simulations have been made. Just as before, optimal
reproduction was computed in the frequency domain for the case of plane waves travelling in free-ﬁeld. Firstly, the
total ﬁeld around a rigid sphere (ﬁgure 8a) was computed. Figure 9a shows that the difference between the incident
ﬁeld and the total ﬁeld (including the scattering by the sphere) decreases fastly as the distance to the sphere increases.
Furthermore the decreasing error curve can be divided in two parts: a fast decrease occurs bewteen 0 and 50 cm,
whereas the decrease is slower at more than 50 cm from the sphere. For noise reproduction this means that the
inﬂuence of the scattered noise can be efﬁciently reduced by moving the control microphones away from the sphere
surface in the 0-50 cm zone, but not that much for larger distances.

In a second step the soundﬁeld was computed for a wave impinging a ﬁnite element head model of a sphere
with two “ears” and a “nose” (ﬁgure 8b). The difference between this soundﬁeld and the soundﬁeld around the mere
sphere is shown in ﬁgure 9b. As for the previous ﬁgure, zones of fast and slow decrease appear. Again, moving
away the microphones from the head of two different listeners minimizes the difference in the soundﬁeld that must
be reproduced. However, this is not so relevant at a distance of more than 50 cm when the decrease in the difference
is very slow when compared to the increase in reproduction error resulting from enlarging the controlled area with a
constant number of microphones.

Finally, optimal reproduction of a low-frequency plane wave soundﬁeld in free-ﬁeld was tested in three conﬁg-
urations: the soundﬁelds computed ﬁrstly with the sphere, secondly with the head model, and thirdly without any
scattering object was reproduced by BPC around the sphere. It appeared ﬁrstly that no large error was made when
reproducing around the sphere the ﬁeld computed with the head model, at least at low frequencies. This was expected
because of the dimensions of the “ears” and “nose” details compared to the wavelength. Secondly, the error resulting
from reproducing, around the sphere, the noise computed without an object is much larger.

sphere; (b) the total pressure values around the two head models, as a function of the distance from the diffractive
object.

B. Conclusions
In conclusion to these different simulations:

1. The inﬂuence of the diffractive object is reduced at low frequencies, i.e. when its dimensions are small when
compared to the wavelength of the incident sound. It can be noted that this will always be true for a human head
at frequencies inferior to 300 Hz.

2. At these frequencies, it is possible to use the soundﬁeld recorded around a listener A as a reference for the

reproduction of the soundﬁeld around B.

3. It is useless to put the recording/control microphones at a distance larger than 50 cm from the listener since
the resulting beneﬁt in terms of error between the sound pressure values is then small when compared to the
reproduction accuracy loss which results from the enlargement of the control surface.

4. Even at low frequency, the reproduction is inaccurate around a listener when the ﬁeld which is reproduced is
only made of the incident wave (and does not include the scattered wave). This shows that it is important to
record or compute the original ﬁeld with a person (or perhaps with a dummy head) inside the volume deﬁned
by the microphones.

6. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES
Simulations of sonic boom reproduction in a room and, in free ﬁeld, around a human head model, have been per-
formed. Although these simulations involve theoretical optimal control, they provide an evaluation of the best achiev-
able performances which encourages in using BPC for sonic boom reproduction. The LMA room is now ready for
experiments, sound reproduction and psycho-acoustic tests will be conducted soon.

It has also been observed numerically that the eigenfrequencies of the Dirichlet problem pose no problem for
sonic boom reproduction with BPC. A free-ﬁeld experiment of ANC in a volume using the BPC method will also be
conducted soon at the LMA in order to conﬁrm this numerical result.

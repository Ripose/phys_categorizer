Abstract

The dynamic of a classical system can be expressed by means of Poisson

brackets.

In this paper we generalize the relation between the usual non

covariant Hamiltonian and the Poisson brackets to a covariant Hamiltonian

and new brackets in the frame of the Minkowski space. These brackets can

be related to those used by Feynman in his derivation of Maxwell’s equations.

The case of curved space is also considered with the introduction of Christoﬀel

symbols, covariant derivatives, and curvature tensors.

I. INTRODUCTION

A remarkable formulation of classical dynamics is provided by Hamiltonian mechanics.

This is an old subject. However, new discoveries are still been made; we quote two ex-

amples among several: the Arnold duality transformations, which generalize the canonical

transformations [1,2], and the extensions of the Poisson brackets to diﬀerential forms and

multi-vector ﬁelds by A.Cabras and M.Vinogradov [3]. In this context the transition from

classical to relativistic mechanics raises the question of Hamiltonian covariance, the physical

signiﬁcance of which is discussed by Goldstein [4]. In the ﬁrst part of this paper we brieﬂy

1

recall the Poisson brackets approach and the covariant Hamiltonian formalism. Then we in-

troduce new brackets to study the dynamics associated to this covariant Hamiltonian, which

deﬁne an algebraic structure between position and velocity, and does not have an explicit

formulation. We examine the close link between these brackets and those used by Feynman

for his derivation of the Maxwell equations [5–8]. A very interesting way to arrive at the

same sort of result was found by Souriau in the frame of his symplectic classical mechanics

[9]. In the ﬁnal part of this work we consider the dynamics in curved space, using Christoﬀel

symbols, covariant derivatives, and curvature tensors expressed in terms of these brackets.

II. BRIEF REVIEW OF ANALYTIC MECHANICS

A. Poisson brackets

The dynamics of a classical particle in a 3-dimensional ﬂat space with vector position qi

and vector momentum pi (i = 1, 2, 3) is deﬁned by the Hamilton equations:

.
qi

= dqi

dt = ∂H
∂pi

(1)

.
pi= dpi

dt = − ∂H

∂qi

.
qi

= {qi, H}

.

pi= {pi, H}

(2)

where the Hamiltonian H(qi, pi) is a form on the phase space ( the cotangent ﬁber space).

They can be also expressed in a symmetric manner by means of Poisson brackets:

These brackets are naturally deﬁned as skew symmetric bilinear maps on the space of func-

tions on the phase space in the following form:

{f, g} =

∂f
∂qi

∂g
∂pi −

∂g
∂qi

∂f
∂pi

B. Covariant Hamiltonian

Except in the electromagnetic situation, the Hamiltonian is not the total energy when

it is time-dependent, and its generalization to relativistic problems with the M4 Minkowski

space is not trivial because it is not Lorentz covariant.

In the electromagnetic case the answer to this question is given by the introduction of

the following covariant expression [4] :

H = uµpµ − L = uµ(muµ +

q
c

Aµ)

where L is the usual invariant electromagnetic Lagrangian :

L =

1
2

m uµuµ +

q
c

uµAµ

(4)

(5)

and uµ the quadri-velocity deﬁned by means of the proper time tp, here used as an invariant

parameter:

uµ =

dxµ
dtp

Finally we have the covariant Hamiltonian

H =

1
2

m uµuµ

with the corresponding eight Hamilton equations:

(6)

(7)

(8)

∂H
∂pµ

= dxµ
dtp

= uµ

∂H

∂xµ = − dpµ

dtp




It is interesting to recall that this structure is only possible in the situation where the

potential can be put in a covariant manner as in the electromagnetism theory.

III. LORENTZ COVARIANT HAMILTONIAN AND BRACKETS FORMALISM

Now we want to generalize the relation between the usual non covariant relativistic

Hamiltonian and the Poisson brackets to a covariant Hamiltonian H and new formal brackets

3

introduced in the frame of the Minkowski space. It is important to remark that, in a diﬀerent

manner, P.Bracken also studied the relation between this Feynman problem and the Poisson

brackets [10].

In this context a ”dynamic evolution law” is given by means of a one real parameter

group of diﬀeomorphic transformations :

g ( IR × M4 ) −→ M4 : g(τ, x) = gτ x = x(τ )

The ”velocity vector” associated to the particle is naturally introduced by:

.

xµ=

d
dτ

gτ xµ

(9)

where the ”time” τ is not identiﬁed with the proper time as we shall see later. The derivative

with respect to this parameter of an arbitrary function deﬁned on the tangent bundle space

can be written, by means of the covariant Hamiltonian, as:

.
x, τ )

df (x,
dτ

= [H, f (x,

.
x, τ )] +

where for H we take the following deﬁnition:

.

x, τ )

∂f (x,
∂τ

H =

1
2

m

dxµ
dτ

dxµ
dτ

=

1
2

m

.

xµ .
xµ

(10)

(11)

Equation (10) giving the dynamic of the system, is the deﬁnition of our new brackets struc-

ture, and is the fundamental equation of the paper.

We require for these new brackets the usual ﬁrst Leibnitz law:

[A, BC] = [A, B] C + [A, C] B

and the skew symmetry:

[A, B] = − [B, A]

where the quantities A, B and C depend of xµ and

.

xµ.

In the case of the vector position xµ(τ ) we have from (10):

4

(12)

(13)

.

xν

xµ= [H, xµ] = m h .

xν, xµi .

and we easily deduce that:

m h .

xν, xµi = gµν

(14)

(15)

where gµν is the metric tensor of the Minkowski space.

As in the Feynman approach the time parameter is not the proper time. To see this we

borrow Tanimura’s argument [6]. Consider the relation

which implies

and is in contradiction with:

gµν dxµ
dtp

dxν
dtp

xλ, gµν dxµ

dτ

dτ # = −

xλ .

(16)

(17)

(18)

But diﬀerently from Feynman, the fact that gµν is the metric is a consequence of the for-

malism and is not imposed by hand. In addition, contrary to Feynman, we do not need to

impose the Leibnitz condition:

d
dτ

[A, B] = " dA

dτ

, B# +"A,

dB

dτ #

(19)

(A and B being position- and velocity-dependent functions) because the time derivative is

given by the fundamental equation (10).

We impose the usual locality property:

[xµ, xν] = 0

(20)

which directly gives for an expandable function of the position or the velocity the following

useful relations:

IV. MAXWELL EQUATIONS

Our formal construction will give the Maxwell equations because it leads to the fun-

damental result (15) which is the starting point of Feynman’s proof of the ﬁrst group of

Maxwell equations. The diﬀerence is that our main property is equation (10) and not the

Leibnitz rule (19). So our derivation will be obtained diﬀerently and will give in addition

the two groups of Maxwell equations.

• To be general, we choose like in [8], the following deﬁnition for the gauge curvature:

.
xµ,

h

.

xνi = −

1
m2 (qF µν + g ∗F µν)

(30)

where g will be interpreted as the magnetic charge of the Dirac monopole, the *-operation

being the Hodge duality.

• A simple derivative gives:

d(qF µν(x) + g ∗F µν(x))

dτ

= q∂ρF µν(x)

.
xρ +g∂

ρ ∗F µν(x)

.
xρ

(31)

and by means of the fundamental relation (10) we obtain:

d(qF µν(x) + g ∗F µν(x))

dτ

= [H, qF µν(x) + g ∗F µν(x)]

m3

xµ,

(32)

Now using the Jacobi identity we rewrite this expression as:

xρ −g(∂µ ∗F νρ + ∂ν ∗F ρµx)

xρ(cid:17) .

(33)

By comparing equations (31) and (33) we deduce the following ﬁeld equation:

q(∂µF νρ + ∂ν F ρµ + ∂ρF µν) + g(∂µ ∗F νρ + ∂ν ∗F ρµ + ∂ρ ∗F µν) = 0

(34)

that is:

∂µF νρ + ∂ν F ρµ + ∂ρF µν = gN µνρ

∂µ ∗F νρ + ∂ν ∗F ρµ + ∂ρ ∗F µν = −qN µνρ

(35)




where N µνρ is a tensor to be interpreted.

Using the diﬀerential forms language deﬁned on the Minkowski space (M4) we write the

preceding equations in a compact form:

dF = gN

d∗F = −qN




where F and ∗F ∈ ∧2(M4) and N ∈ ∧3(M4) .

If we put:

where j and k ∈ ∧1(M4), we deduce:






gN = −∗k

qN =∗ j

δF = j

dF = −∗k

8

(36)

(37)

(38)

δ is the usual codiﬀerential

deﬁned here as:

δ : ∧k(M4) → ∧k−1(M4)

δ = (−)k(4−k+1)+1(∗d∗)

Interpreting the 1-forms j and k as the electric and magnetic four dimensional current

densities, we obtained the two groups of Maxwell equations in the presence of a magnetic

monopole. The situation without monopole is evidently obtained by putting the 1-form k

equal to zero.

We easily see by means of the Poincar´e theorem that:

δ2F = δj = 0

which is nothing else that the current density continuity equation:

∂µ jµ = m [

.
xµ, jµ] = 0,

From the skew property of the brackets, we can choose:

jµ = ρ

.
xµ,

ρ is the charge density whose dynamic evolution is given by:

dρ
dτ

= [H, ρ] = mh .

xµ, ρi .

xµ= (∂µρ)

.
xµ= ∂µjµ = 0

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

We see that H automatically takes into account the gauge curvature. It plays the role of a

Hamiltonian not with the usual Poisson brackets, but with new four-dimensional brackets

which can be related to for example, those used by Feynman in his derivation of Maxwell

equations as published by Dyson [5].

V. APPLICATION TO A CURVED SPACE

In this section we extend the previous analysis to the case of a general space time metric

gµν(x).

form ds2 in the following manner:

the brackets structure:

Note that this tensor is now velocity-dependent, in contrast to the Minkowski case.

By means of equation (23) and (43), we deduce the relation:

= ∂ν gρµ − ∂µgρν

then:

N µν(x,

(43)

(44)

situation of a ﬂat space, we can put:

As in the case of ﬂat Minkowski space, it is not diﬃcult to recover the two groups of

Maxwell equations with or without monopoles. In this last case we must take the following

deﬁnition for the dual ﬁeld:

11

∗F µν =

1

2√−g

εµνρσFρσ.

(55)

Now we will show that the covariant derivative and the curvature tensor can be naturally

introduced with our formalism.

A. Covariant derivative

As in the ﬂat-space case, the equation of motion can be rewritten in the two following

manners:

and:

we then put:

(56)

(57)

(58)

From equation (58), a covariant derivative can be deﬁned by means of the brackets. For an

arbitrary vector we put:

m [

.
xν, V µ(x)] =

∂V µ(x)

∂xν

We then deﬁne as the usual covariant derivative:

[Dν, V µ] =

∂V µ
∂xν + Γµ

νρV ρ

and for an arbitrary mixed tensor:

[Dν, T µ

σ] =

σ

∂T µ
∂xν + Γµ

νρT ρ

σ − Γρ

νσT µ

For the particular case of the velocity we get:

and in addition we recover the standard result:

(59)

B. Curvature tensor

From this deﬁnition of the covariant derivative we can naturally express a curvature

tensor by means of the brackets. Let’s compute the following expressions:

[Dµ, [Dν, V ρ]] = h .

xµ, ∂ν V ρ + Γνρ

σ V σi + Γµν
σ )V σ + Γνρ

= ∂µ∂ν V ρ + ∂µ(Γνρ

α (∂αV ρ + Γαρ

α (∂ν V α + Γαν

α (∂ν V α + Γαν

σ V σ)

and therefore:

[Dµ, [Dν, V ρ]] − [Dν, [Dµ, V ρ]] = ∂µ(Γνρ
+Γνµ

α (∂αV ρ + Γαρ

σ V σ)

α (∂αV ρ + Γαρ

= Rµνρ

σV σ + Ωµν

σ V σ) − Γµν
αDαV ρ

(63)

(64)

where we have introduced the torsion tensor Ωµν

α = Γνµ

α − Γµν

α = 0, and the curvature

tensor Rµνρ

σ . Due to symmetric property of the Christoﬀel symbols, the curvature tensor

is reduced to:

Rµνρ

σV σ = ∂µ(Γνρ

σ )V σ − ∂ν(Γµρ

σ )V σ + Γµρ

α Γαν

σ V σ − Γνρ

α Γαµ

σ V σ

The Jacobi identity gives:

[Dµ, [Dν, V ρ]] + [Dν, [V ρ, Dµ]] + [V ρ, [Dµ, Dν]] = 0

that is:

and ﬁnally:

[Dµ, [Dν, V ρ]] − [Dν, [Dµ, V ρ]] = [[Dµ, Dν] , V ρ] = 0

[[Dµ, Dν] , V ρ] = Rµνρ

σV σ

(65)

(66)

(67)

(68)

remark 2. We can also deﬁne the Ricci and the electromagnetic energy-impulsion tensors,

but we were unable to deduce the Einstein equation from this formalism. Naturally, we can

write this equation with our brackets as a constraint equation.

13

remark 3. We can generalize the covariant derivative in including the skew-symmetric

tensor F µ

ν in the deﬁnition. For this we take into account the gauge curvature for the

determination of the new covariant derivative. For a vectorial function of the velocity we

write:

[∆ν, f µ(

.
x)] =

and then for the velocity:

.
x)

∂f µ(
∂xν + Γµ

νρf ρ(

F µ

ν = 0

(69)

(70)

The covariant derivatives, are then simultaneously covariant under both local internal

and external gauges. If we want to keep a synthetic form for the formulas using the curvature

and torsion tensors, we must suppose for an arbitrary vector the relation:

[∆ν, V µ] =

∂V µ
∂xν + Γµ

νρV ρ − Aν V µ

where the vector Aν is deﬁned by the following equation:

F µν = m(cid:16)h .

xµ, Aνi −h .

xν, Aiµ(cid:17)

(71)

(72)

therefore we have:

[∆µ, [∆ν , V ρ]] − [∆ν , [∆µ, V ρ]] = [[∆µ, ∆ν] , V ρ] = Rµνρ

σV σ + Ωµν

α∆αV ρ + F µνV ρ

We deﬁne a new ”generalized” curvature tensor which matches the local electromagnetism

internal symmetry with the local external symmetry:

then:

VI. CONCLUSION

The goal of this work was to study the dynamic associated with the Lorentz-covariant

Hamiltonian well known in analytic mechanic. For this, we introduced a four dimensional

bracket structure which gives an algebraic structure between the position and velocity and

generalizes the Poisson brackets. This leads us to introduce a new time parameter which

is not the proper time, but is the conjugate coordinate of this covariant Hamiltonian. This

formal construction allows to recover the two groups of Maxwell equations in ﬂat space.

This approach is close to the one used by Feynman in his own derivation of the ﬁrst group

of Maxwell equations.

The principal interest of this method, besides the phase space formalism, is in the study

of theories with gauges symmetries because it avoids the introduction of the non-gauge

invariant momentum.

Our formalism can be directly extrapolated to the curved space, where the principal

notions are introduced in a natural manner. A ﬁve-dimensional structure can also be studied

by considering the τ parameter as a ﬁfth coordinate. In such a case equations take a simpler

form, particularly the group of Maxwell equations, but the meaning of this new coordinate

is still diﬃcult to interpret, and could be perhaps understood in the context of Kaluza-Klein

compactiﬁcation.

Just after ﬁnishing this work we received a paper referring to the covariant Hamiltonian

in the context of Feynman’s proof of the Maxwell equations [11] .

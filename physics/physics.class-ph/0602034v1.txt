The planar motion of a testing body in the (cid:28)eld of gravity of the massive ring is studied. The

"perihelion" preession due to non-relativisti reasons is demonstrated on this simple example

of planar motion in the radially symmetri (in the plane of motion) situation. The ring as the

soure of the gravitational (cid:28)eld an serve as the toy model for quasi-planar soures of gravity

appearing in the galati dynamis, et. The results are used to estimate the real perihelion

shift of the planet Merury due to gravitational quadrupole moment of the Sun.

1 The potential

Let us onsider the thin (one dimensional) homogenous massive ring of radius R with total mass
M . We onsider the artesian oordinates x, y, z suh that the plane Oxy oinides with the

plane de(cid:28)ned by the ring itself, and the origin of our oordinates oinides with the enter of the

ring. Our (cid:28)rst task is to ompute the Newtonian potential V = V (x, y) of the gravitational (cid:28)eld
of the ring in the plane Oxy . Beause of the rotational invariane of the problem, the potential
is the funtion of radial distane r =

x2 + y2

only. Aording to the Newton's gravitational

law we have

Equation (3) tells us that at large distanes from the ring the (cid:28)eld is almost idential with the

(cid:28)eld of point mass M and the leading orretion term (proportional to (r/R)2

) is the pro jetion

of the quadrupole (cid:28)eld into the plane of the ring. Equation (4) shows that the enter of the ring

is an unstable equilibrium. If a testing partile is displaed a little bit from the enter then it

is fored to move towards the ring, and the fore is proportional to the distane from the enter

(inverted linear harmoni potential). Finally, equation (5) shows the feature of the potential

lose the ring. Namely, there is the logarithmi divergeny of the potential as r

R.

2 Equations of motion and the onservation laws

An easy way how to obtain equations of motion is to write down the Lagrange funtion (the

Lagrangian) of the testing partile with the mass m in polar oordinates (r, φ) (we will onsider

the motion in the plane of the ring only, as we have already mentioned above):

where the dot stands for the time derivative, and derive the equations of motion as the Euler -

Lagrange equations

¨r + V ′(r) = 0,

r2 ¨φ + 2r ˙r ˙φ = 0.

The order of this system of two di(cid:27)erential equations an be redued using the onservation

laws. First of all, the energy E is onserved:

The angular momentum vetor must have the form (0, 0,
have the following expression for the z - omponent of the angular momentum:

L

). Sine L does not depend on φ, we

The previous two equations an be ombined into one expressing the radial veloity ˙r as the
funtion of the radial position r and the onserved quantities E and L:

the fration T /Tp with the parameters hosen in the same way as in the left graph. We see that
the quantity T approahes relatively Tp as r0/R grows. More detailed analysis would show that the

[1℄ or detailed proof in [2℄. Therefore our

lose-to-irular orbit will not be losed, however for a small deviation from the irle it an be

regarded as slowly rotating ellipse. We are interested in the angle onneting the two nearest

positions of the partile and the ring (the point of losest approah of a planet (from our solar

system, of ourse) and the Sun is alled perihelion) and the enter of our oordinate system.

Combining the eqs. (9) and (10) we easily an derive that the hange of the polar angle ∆φ

between the two forthoming losest approahes of the partile with respet to the ring is given

2π omes from the Newton potential and additional term δφ is alled perihelion shift in the

mehanis of planetary motion around the Sun or the periastron shift in the mehanis of binary

Figure 3: Plot of the tra jetory of a testing partile in the (cid:28)eld of massive ring. The radius of the

ring is R = 1 and E and L were hosen so that the related Keplerian tra jetory would be desribed
by rm = 3 and rM = 15. The body of the ring is depited as the entral irle. The partile orbits the

ring anti-lokwise, we see, from the left (cid:28)gure, that the "perihelion" moves in the same diretion.

6 Disussion

We have studied in details the motion of a testing partile in the gravitational (cid:28)eld of the massive

planar ring. As the main aim, we have determined the shift of the perihelion of the testing partile

with non-irular orbit with su(cid:30)iently large radius. For r/R
1 the gravitational (cid:28)eld of the
ring is pratially idential with the (cid:28)eld of entral monopole of the mass M and the quadrupole

≫

(cid:28)eld, see (3). The formula (16) desribes, in fat, the perihelion shift for the partile in the

planar motion due to quadrupole perturbation of Newton potential. Hene, it an be uses to

estimate the perihelion shift of the planet Merury due to Solar quadrupole moment, onsidering

the approximation that the tra jetory of Merury is plaed in the plane of the solar equator.

where M⊙ is the mass of the Sun, R⊙ is the mean radius of the Sun, P2(z) =

is the

is the

dimensionless quadrupole moment of the Sun - for a long time the value of solar gravitational

quadrupole was very unertain, this value is from [3℄. In the equator of the Sun plane we have

ϑ = π/2 and therefore in the mentioned plane the potential has the form

So, we an use the formula (16) to ompute the Merury's perihelion shift due to the Sun's

quadrupole moment identifying the onstant γ as follows:

This means that during the period of 100 years, the perihelion of the Merury is shifted in the
diretion of planetary rotation around the Sun in approximately 0.28 arse. This value an be
ompared with the well-known value of the relativisti shift of the perihelion that is about 35

arse per a entury. Our value (18) is quite less that is in aordane with aepted fat that

the Solar quadrupole does not e(cid:27)et essentially the Merury's orbit in the time interval about

100 years.

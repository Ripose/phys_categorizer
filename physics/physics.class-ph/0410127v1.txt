We develop a Hamiltonian theory for a time dispersive and dissipative inhomogeneous medium, as
described by a linear response equation respecting causality and power dissipation. The canonical
Hamiltonian constructed here exactly reproduces the original dissipative evolution after integrating
out auxiliary ﬁelds. In particular, for a dielectric medium we obtain a simple formula for the Hamil-
tonian and closed form expressions for the energy density and energy ﬂux involving the auxiliary
ﬁelds. The developed approach also allows to treat a long standing problem of scattering from a
lossy non-spherical obstacle.

PACS numbers: 42.25.Bs, 03.50.De, 46.40.Cd.

There is an intrinsic ambiguity in identifying the ﬁeld
energy densities for radiation in a time dispersive and
dissipative (TDD) medium as described by the linear re-
sponse theory, e.g., in a dielectric medium described by
the classical linear Maxwell equations with complex val-
ued frequency dependent electric permittivity ε(ω) and
magnetic permeability µ(ω). Consequently, there are
problems with the interpretation of the energy balance
equation [1, 2]. There were a number of eﬀorts [2, 3]
to construct a consistent macroscopic theory of dielec-
tric media that accounts for dispersion and dissipation,
based on more fundamental microscopic theories. At ﬁrst
sight, it seems that the introduction of a realistic material
medium in an explicit form similar to [2, 3] is the only
way to model a TDD medium.
In fact, that is not so
and the subject of this letter is a consistent macroscopic
approach within the linear response theory.

A linear response TDD medium is an essentially open
dissipative system, which in principle can be obtained
by i.) eliminating some degrees of freedom from a more
involved microscopic theory and ii.) making the approx-
imation of linear response. Stopping short of introducing
a microscopic theory we ask,
is there a conservative ex-
tended system which exactly reproduces the given TDD
system after reduction? We show here that such an ex-
tension is possible by constructing a quadratic Hamilto-
nian for the conservative extension, based only on the
given TDD equations.

In particular, we construct such a Hamiltonian for a
dielectric medium as deﬁned by complex ε (ω) and µ (ω).
The construction given here is not restricted to a di-
electric medium, but is completely general and holds for
TDD systems with a certain mathematical structure —
eqs. (10, 11, 12) below —including, in particular, elastic
and acoustic media, and it can also be extended to space
dispersive dissipative systems. A somewhat related con-
struction of the evolution equations for linear absorptive

dielectrics was given by Tip [4]. The range of validity of
the proposed theory is the same as for the linear response,
though a nonlinear generalization is clearly possible.

Other important beneﬁts of the approach developed
here are: i.) The constructed Hamiltonian is an integral
of a local energy density, which in the absence of TDD
terms reduces to the local ﬁeld energy. This permits us
to derive an expression for the energy transport for TDD
media. ii.) The present formulation allows to treat a long
standing problem of scattering from a lossy nonspherical
scatter — analyzed by other methods with limited suc-
cess [5] — by applying the well developed scattering the-
ory [6] for conservative systems. These applications will
be discussed in detail in forthcoming work.

There is some relation in spirit between our theory and
a recently proposed hydrodynamic theory (HT) [7]. Both
theories are self contained, macroscopic, and make no
assumption on the underlying microstructure. However
unlike the HT, the proposed theory makes no use of pa-
rameters other than the susceptibilities of linear response
theory. Furthermore, it is truly conservative, with dissi-
pative eﬀects modeled by eﬀectively irreversible energy
transport to an auxiliary system, which in the simplest
examples may be conceived of as constructed from ﬂex-
ible strings. In contrast, the HT makes use of explicitly
dissipative, nonconservative equations similar to those of
Navier-Stokes.

The evolution equations of the proposed theory, com-
ing as they do from a Hamiltonian, are time reversible.
Nonetheless, an irreversible motion of the TDD system
stems from the inﬁnite heat capacity of the auxiliary sys-
tem. This is demonstrated in its simplest form by the
Lamb model [8] — see Fig. 1 — in which the energy of
an oscillator escapes to inﬁnity along an attached ﬂex-
ible string. The theory proposed here illustrates that,
from the standpoint of thermodynamics, dissipation in
classical linear response is an idealization which assumes

ation damping, is a point mass attached to an inﬁnite elastic

classical linearly damped oscillator.

inﬁnite heat capacity of (hidden) degrees of freedom.

The need for a Hamiltonian description of a dissipa-
tive system has long been known, having been empha-
sized by Morse and Feshbach [9] forty years ago. They
constructed, for a damped oscillator, an artiﬁcial Hamil-
tonian based on a “mirror-image” trick, about which they
wrote, “By this arbitrary trick we are able to handle dissi-
pative systems as though they were conservative. This is
not very satisfactory if an alternate method of solution is
known...” The Hamiltonian we construct for TDD media
can be viewed as a “satisfactory solution” since, unlike
the “mirror-image” Hamiltonian, our Hamiltonian has a
transparent interpretation as the system energy.

We consider a system described by two canonical vec-
tor coordinates p, q
H, with H a real Hilbert space. In
the absence of TDD terms, the evolution is supposed to
be induced by a Hamiltonian A (p, q) of the form

The electromagnetic ﬁeld in a non-dispersive inhomo-

with p = (4π)−1A (magnetic potential), q = D (elec-
tric displacement), fp = (2√π)−1H (magnetic ﬁeld), and
fq = (2√π)−1E (electric ﬁeld). Identifying (2) with the
material relations, we determine the action of the opera-

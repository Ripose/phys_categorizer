We derive an exact expression for entropy production during eﬀusion of an ideal gas driven by
momentum transfer in addition to energy and particle ﬂux. Following the treatment in Phys. Rev.
E 74, 021117 (2006), we construct a master equation formulation of the process and explicitly verify
the thermodynamic ﬂuctuation theorem, thereby directly exhibiting its extended applicability to
particle ﬂows and hence to hydrodynamic systems.

INTRODUCTION

Since the pioneering work of Onsager [1] on the relation
between linear response and equilibrium ﬂuctuations, his
insights have been further formalized in, for example,
the theory of linear irreversible processes [2] and the
ﬂuctuation-dissipation theorem [3]. Over the past decade
some new surprising results have been discovered that
suggest relations valid far away from equilibrium, notably
the ﬂuctuation [4] and work [5] theorems. The ﬂuctua-
tion theorem, originally demonstrated for nonequilibrium
steady states in thermostated systems, has been proven
in a number of diﬀerent settings. Basically, it states that
during an experiment of duration t, it is exponentially
more likely to observe a positive entropy production ∆S
rather than an equally large negative one,

conserved quantities whose transport forms the basis of
hydrodynamics. Our derivation therefore puts the ﬂuctu-
ation theorem fully in this context (see also [7]). Finally,
as a bi-product, we calculate the Onsager matrix for the
Knudsen ﬂow problem including momentum transport.
In Sec. II we formulate the ﬂuctuation theorem for eﬀu-
sion with momentum transfer for an ideal gas. Section III
generalizes the derivation of the master equation and cu-
mulant generating function in [6] to the case with mo-
mentum transfer. Veriﬁcation of the ﬂuctuation theorem
is detailed in Sec. IV, and the lowest order cumulants are
exhibited in Sec.V. We use these results to verify the On-
sager relations for this nonequilibrium system in Sec.VI.
We end with a brief conclusion in Sec. VII. Some details
of the calculations are presented in appendices.

II. FLUCTUATION THEOREM FOR EFFUSION
WITH MOMENTUM TRANSFER

In the application to nonequilibrium steady states, the
above result is typically only valid in the asymptotic limit
t → ∞ and expresses a symmetry property of large devi-
ations.

We address another scenario in which the system is
perturbed out of a state which is initially at equilibrium.
The so-called transient ﬂuctuation theorem is then valid
for all times t. We consider the problem of a Knudsen
ﬂow between ideal gases that have overall non-zero mo-
mentum. In this case, the stationary state is reached in-
stantaneously, so that there is no distinction between the
transient and steady state versions of the theorem. We
show that the system obeys a detailed ﬂuctuation theo-
rem which includes (1) as a special case. Our calculation
is an extension of the one given in [6] to include momen-
tum transfer. The interest of this extension is manifold.
First, the derivation of the ﬂuctuation theorem is some-
what more complicated since the momentum is a quantity
which is odd under velocity inversion. Second, momen-
tum, together with particle number and energy, are the

We begin by considering two (inﬁnitely) large neigh-
boring reservoirs, A and B, each of which contains an
ideal gas of uniform density ni in equilibrium at temper-
ature Ti, i ∈ A, B. In addition, the particles of gas i have
an overall center of mass velocity Vi in the ex direction
(Fig. 1). That is, the velocity distributions of the gas
particles take the Maxwellian form

The two reservoirs are separated by a common adiabatic
wall parallel to the ex direction, with a hole of surface
area σ whose linear dimensions are small compared with
the mean free path of the particles. As a result, the
local equilibrium in each reservoir is not disturbed by the
exchange of mass, heat, and momentum during a ﬁnite
time interval t in which the hole is open. Upon a transfer
of total energy ∆U , particles ∆N , and momentum ∆px
during this time interval, the overall change in entropy

2

the time duration t, is likewise a ﬂuctuating quantity.
However, time reversal symmetry of the microscopic dy-
namics a relation for the probability distribution of this
entropy production, as expressed in Eq. (1). Due to the
absence of memory eﬀects, ∆S is in fact a stochastic pro-
cess with independent increments: contributions to ∆S
from any two equal, non-overlapping time intervals are
independent identically distributed random variables. It
is therefore convenient to introduce the cumulant gener-
ating function, which takes the form
−tg(λ).

−λ∆Si = e

he

The ﬂuctuation theorem, Eq. 1, implies the following

symmetry property:

g(λ) = g(k

−1 − λ).

(6)

As the derivation in Appendix B points out, one can
augment the observation of the entropy production with
additional variables, while retaining the form of the ﬂuc-
tuation theorem. Hence the following more detailed ﬂuc-
tuation theorem, which is expressed in terms of the joint
probability density involving all three conserved quanti-
ties, particle number, momentum and energy, is obtained:

Pt(∆U, ∆N, ∆px)
Pt(−∆U, −∆N, −∆px)

= e∆S/k.

(7)

Since the increments of ∆U , ∆N , and ∆px are also inde-
pendent, we can write the corresponding cumulant gen-
erating function as

−(λU ∆U+λN ∆N +λpx ∆px)i = e

−tg(λU ,λN ,λpx ).

he

(8)

The detailed ﬂuctuation theorem then requires the fol-
lowing symmetry relation, similar to Eq. (6):

g(λU ,λN , λpx )

= g(AU k

−1 − λU , AN k

−1 − λN , Apxk

−1 − λpx ).
(9)
Note ﬁnally that Eq. (7), apart from implying the nor-
mal ﬂuctuation theorem Eq. (1), also implies ﬂuctua-
tion theorems for particle, energy, and momentum trans-
fer individually when the complementary thermodynamic
forces are zero:

Pt(∆U )
Pt(−∆U )
Pt(∆N )
Pt(−∆N )
Pt(∆px)
Pt(−∆px)

= e∆S/k; AN = Apx = 0,

= e∆S/k; AU = Apx = 0,

(10)

= e∆S/k; AU = AN = 0.

In the equation for AN , we have used the expression for
the chemical potential µ of an ideal gas at rest. Since the
explicit expression for the thermodynamic forces in sys-
tems with momentum is not readily available, we provide
a brief derivation in Appendix A.

The variables ∆U , ∆N , and ∆px all correspond to ﬂuc-
tuating quantities inﬂuenced by single particle crossings
on each side of the adiabatic wall. As a result, the total
entropy production ∆S, which will be observed during

theory of gases allows us to calculate the probability per

energy E = 1

the hole from reservoir i to reservoir j. Speciﬁcally, the
transition rate in question is given by (see Appendix A):

We have written Ti→j(E, px) without the arguments for

ing the equation in Fourier space; that is, we multiply
both sides of the equation by exp[−(λU ∆U + λN ∆N +
λpx ∆px)] and integrate ∆U , ∆px over all space and sum
over all integers ∆N . We arrive at the expression

IV. FLUCTUATION SYMMETRY

We now proceed to explicitly verify the symmetry re-
lation (9) and hence the ﬂuctuation theorem. Concep-
tually, one may understand this symmetry relation as
follows. Under the symmetry operation T – that is, un-
der the transformation given by the r.h.s. of Eq. (9) –
the term containing the exponential in gA (which we call
gA,1) becomes the corresponding term from gB (which
we call gB,1) and similarly, the original gB,1 term be-
comes gA,1, thereby preserving the overall structure of g.
Mathematically, we can express this as:

T [gA,1] = gB,1,
T [gB,1] = gA,1,

(20)

g(λU , λN , λpx ) = I3 − (I1 + I2).

(15)

where

The integrals (14) can easily be performed by switching

The joint cumulant κijk of power i in energy ﬂux, j in

function, namely,

which clearly has the required symmetry Oij = Oji. The
Onsager relations [Eq. (31)] fully detail the complex cou-
pling between energy, particle, and momentum transport
in the linear regime. We highlight a few interesting cases.
In the case of moving gases, V 6= 0, the presence of a
temperature gradient alone (∆n = ∆V = 0) is suﬃcient
to produce a nonzero net ﬂux of momentum. Further-
more, the energy ﬂux is then given by

(cid:19)

In the absence of overall momentum (V = 0), this expres-
sion reduces to the typical formula for temperature driven
heat ﬂow down the temperature gradient (JU < 0). How-
ever, the presence of nonzero V allows for the reversal of
the heat current, JU > 0, namely when

(34)

Equation (34) thus provides a condition for transporting
energy against a temperature gradient.

Considering the case when there is only a momentum
gradient, ∆T = ∆n = 0, the heat, particle, and momen-
tum ﬂuxes reduce to:

Therefore, when we choose the velocities to be equal but
opposite so that V = 0, the only nonzero ﬂux is due to
momentum transport.
In other words, momentum ex-
change takes place without a net exchange of particles or
energy.

VII. CONCLUSION

The work and ﬂuctuation theorems are quite remark-
able. They are basically one further step in Onsager’s
program to take into account the time-reversal symmetry
of the microscopic dynamics. This results in a stringent
constraint on the probability density of the entropy pro-
duction. The implications of this result are still being
explored. In this paper we have shown by an explicit mi-
croscopically exact calculation that the ﬂuctuation the-
orem applies for the eﬀusion between ideal gases with
non-zero overall momentum. This sets the stage for the
application of the formalism in ﬂuctuating hydrodynam-
ics.

APPENDIX A

We can derive the thermodynamic forces for an ideal
gas of N particles in volume V with non-zero momentum

by considering the entropy S(U, N, V) of a gas at rest as
a function of U , the total energy, N , and V. Because
adding an overall velocity to the gas does not change its
volume in phase space and hence its entropy, we can write
the entropy S(U, N, V, p) of a ﬂowing gas which depends
on momentum p in terms of the entropy S0(U, N, V) of a
gas at rest:

p2
2N m

S(U, N, V, p) = S0((U −

), N, V) = S0(ǫ, N, V),

(A1)
where ǫ ≡ U − p2/2N m represents the internal energy
of the gas. The Sackur-Tetrode formula [9] provides the
explicit expression for S(ǫ, N, V) which, with Eq. (A1)
leads to

where Si corresponds to Eq. (A2) with U → Ui, N → Ni,
and p → pi, i ∈ A, B, and we have used momentum,
energy, and particle conservation to write dU = −dUA =
dUB, dN = −dNA = dNB, and dp = −dpA = dpB.
Performing the above calculations and considering that
the total energy U of an ideal gas with overall momentum

we arrive after simpliﬁcation at the expressions given in
Eq. (4).

APPENDIX B

We give a derivation of the ﬂuctuation theorem,
Eq. (7), by adapting to the present case the procedure
introduced in [10]. We consider the Hamiltonian evolu-
tion of a system, consisting of two disjoint subsystems
A and B initially at equilibrium characterized by micro-
canonical distributions with total particle number, mo-
mentum, energy and volume equal to Ni, pi, Ui and Vi,
i = A, B, respectively. At the initial time, the constraint
It is assumed that
separating both systems is broken.

this can be achieved without any external work, mo-
mentum exchange or other perturbation of the subsys-
tems. This is clearly the case for the opening of a hole in
the adiabatic wall separating ideal gases, as considered
here. After a time interval of duration t, the constraint
is again introduced at no cost of energy or momentum.
One records the new values of the parameters N ′
i and
U ′
i . The amounts (∆N, ∆p, ∆U ) that are transported
from system A to system B will depend on the speciﬁc
run, i.e., on the starting conﬁguration at t = 0. Let the
volume in phase space corresponding to the initial states
that lead to the transport of these amounts be denoted
by Ω(Ni,pi,Ui)(∆N, ∆p, ∆U ). The probability to observe
such a realization is then given by

i , p′

P(Ni,pi,Ui)(∆N, ∆p, ∆U ) =

Ω(Ni,pi,Ui)(∆N, ∆p, ∆U )
Ω(Ni,pi,Ui)

(B1)
where Ω(Ni,pi,Ui) is the total phase space volume. We
now apply this very same result for parameter values
N ′
i , i = A, B, and consider the probability
of transporting the amounts (−∆N, ∆p, −∆U ). Apart
from velocity inversion, the ﬁnal values in this proce-
dure are then the initial ones of the ﬁrst scenario, i.e.,
(Ni, −pi, Ui). The corresponding probability reads

(B2)

By micro-reversibility, there is a one-to-one correspon-
dence between each trajectory in the ﬁrst situation with
the time reversed trajectory in the second situation. Fur-
thermore, since Hamiltonian dynamics preserves phase
volume, the numerators in the r.h.s. of Eqs. (B1) and
(B2) are identical. We conclude that

where we used the fact that the entropy of a state is
Boltzmann’s constant time the logarithm of the phase
space volume Ω of that state. ∆S is thus the en-
tropy diﬀerence between states with and without the
primes. We now note that inverting the momenta of
the gases does not change the statistics of particle and
energy transport, but will obviously change the sign of
i )(−∆N, ∆p, −∆U ) =
the momentum transfer, P(N ′
i,U ′
P(N ′

Eq. (B3) as follows:

Finally, we consider the thermodynamic limit of in-
ﬁnitely large systems with ﬁnite particle density ni =

7

Ni/Vi, momentum density mVi = pi/Ni, and energy den-
sity ui = Ui/Vi. We furthermore assume that the eﬀects
of the removal of the constraint do not scale with the
volume, so that during the ﬁnite time t it results in non-
extensive changes in the parameter values. Hence we
can drop the sub-indices of P on the l.h.s. of Eq. (B4.
Adding the sub-index t to emphasize the duration of the
exchange, one can thus rewrite Eq. (B4) as Eq. (7) of the
main text.

APPENDIX C

Here we brieﬂy derive the formula for the transition
rate TA→B(E, px) using the kinetic theory of gases. We
consider the ˆz direction to point from reservoir A to reser-
voir B. We require TA→B(E, px)dEdpxdt, the probabil-
ity to observe a particle with kinetic energy in the range
(E, E + dE) and momentum in the range (px, px + dpx)
to cross the hole from A to B in a time interval dt. The
z component of the position of a particle with velocity
v must be located within a cylinder of base area σ (the

area of the hole) and height vzdt measured from the wall.
Furthermore, it must be traveling in the +ez direction
(towards the hole). The appropriate expression is

T A→B(E, px) =

where φA(v, VA) is the Maxwellian given by Eq. (2), and
we have explicitly noted its dependence on v and VA.
A similar equation holds for TA→B. The vx integral is
trivial because of the second delta function, and the re-
maining integrals can be easily performed by changing to
polar coordinates (R, θ), given by

This yields the expressions given in Eq. (11).

Abstract

We prove that, contrary to the common belief, the classical Maxwell electrodynam-
ics of a point-like particle may be formulated as an inﬁnite-dimensional Hamiltonian
system. We derive well deﬁned quasi-local Hamiltonian which possesses direct physical
interpretation being equal to the total energy of the composed system (ﬁeld + particle).
The phase space of this system is endowed with an interesting symplectic structure.
We prove that this structure is strongly non-degenerated and, therefore, enables one
to deﬁne the consistent Poisson bracket for particle’s and ﬁeld degrees of freedom. We
strees that this formulation is perfectly gauge-invariant.

1 Introduction

Classical electrodynamics of charged, point-like particles is usually based on the celebrated
Lorentz-Dirac equation [1] which, although very useful in many applications, has certain
[2] -
inherent diﬃculties. There have been many attempts to solve this problem (see e. g.
[5] for the rewiev). However, there is no solution which is accepted by all physicists.

The aim of this paper is to show that despite of these problems the classical electrodynam-
ics of point particles have well deﬁned Hamiltonian structure. We would like to stress that
the existence of this structure is nontrivial (up to our knowledge, it is completely unknown).
The derivation of the Lorentz-Dirac equation is based on the decomposition of the elec-

tromagnetic ﬁeld into “retarded” and “incoming” components:

f µν = f µν

ret + f µν

in .

(1.1)

In this approach it is impossible to correctly formulate the initial value problem and ﬁnd
the generator of time translations (see [2]). The dynamics of external “incoming” ﬁeld is
already given and the retarded component is fully determined by the particle’s motion.
Therefore, the ﬁeld degrees of freedom are completely eliminated and there is simply no
room for the Hamiltonian description. However, recently it was shown (cf. [6]) that classical
electrodynamics of point-like objects may be formulated as an inﬁnite-dimensional dynamical
system. In this approach particles and ﬁeld degrees of freedom are kept on the same footing.
There is no equations of motion for the particle. It was shown that the conservation law
for the total (renormalized) four-momentum is equivalent to a certain boundary condition
for the electromagnetic ﬁeld along the particle’s trajectory. Together with this condition,
the theory (called electrodynamics of moving particles) becomes causal and complete: initial
data for both the ﬁeld and the particles uniquely imply the evolution of the system. This
means e. g. that the particles trajectories may also be calculated uniquely from the initial
data. Because this approach is relatively little known (and it is crucial for the present paper)
we present a short review in the next Section.

It turns out (cf.

[7]) that the electrodynamics of moving particles possesses very inter-
esting Lagrangian structure. Let us note that the standard variational principle used in
electrodynamics cannot be extended to the theory containing also point-like particles inter-
acting with the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Such a principle is based on the following Lagrangian,
written usually in textbooks:

with

Ltotal = LM axwell + Lparticle + Lint ,

LM axwell =

and the interaction term given by

Lparticle :=

mδζ ,

−

Lint := eAµuµδζ .

(1.4)

(1.5)

Here by δζ we denote the Dirac delta distribution localized on the particle trajectory ζ. The
above Lagrangian may be used to derive the trajectories of the test particles, when the ﬁeld
is given a priori. In a diﬀerent context, it may also be used to derive Maxwell equations,
if the particle trajectories are given a priori. Simultaneous variation with respect to both
ﬁelds and particles leads, however, to a contradiction, since the Lorentz force will be always
ill deﬁned due to Maxwell equations.

But already in the context of the inhomogeneous Maxwell theory with given point-like
sources, the variational principle based on Lagrangian (1.2) is of very limited use, since the
interaction term Lint becomes inﬁnite. As a consequence, the Hamiltonian of such a theory
will always be ill deﬁned, although the theory displays a perfectly causal behaviour.

To improve this bad feature of the theory, a new, quasi-local variational principle for
the Maxwell ﬁeld with given sources was proposed in [7]. This new variational principle is
based on the quasi-local Lagrangian which, contrary to (1.2), is well deﬁned, i.e. produces
no inﬁnities. It was proved (see [7]) that adding to that Lagrangian the particle Lagrangian
(1.4) and varying it with respect to both ﬁelds and particles is now possible and does not
lead to any contradiction. As a result, one obtains precisely the electrodynamics of moving
particles proposed in [6].

In the present paper we give the Hamiltonian formulation of the above theory, i. e.
we shall prove that electrodynamics of moving particles may be formulated as an inﬁnite-
dimensional Hamiltonian system. For the simplicity we consider here only one particle case.
It is of course possible to generalise this result to many particles, however, it is technically
much more complicated.

Obviously, the Hamiltonian description based on the standard Lagrangian (1.2) is incon-
sistent in the case of a point-like sources. In particular, the Hamiltonian of such a theory is
always ill deﬁned. Our approach, based on the quasi-local Lagrangian deﬁned in [7] leads via
an appropriate Legendre transformation to the well deﬁned quasi-local Hamiltonian struc-
ture for ﬁelds interacting with a charged particle.
In particular, the Hamiltonian of the
composed “particle + ﬁeld” system equals numerically to the total energy of the composed
system and, therefore, has a direct physical interpretation.

Moreover, it turns out that the above theory possesses highly nontrivial Poisson bracket
structure. This structure is deﬁned via the symplectic form living in the phase space of
the entire system (particle + ﬁeld). The characteristic feature of the inﬁnite-dimensional
symplectic manifold is that the symplectic 2-form is in general only weakly nondegenerate,
cf. [15]. It means that there need not exist a Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld XF corresponding to
every given functional
on the phase space of the system. For example, our system has well
deﬁned Hamiltonian, however, corresponding vector ﬁeld generated dynamics is not deﬁned
throughout the phase space. We prove (cf. Theorem 4) that this vector ﬁeld is well deﬁned
if and only if we restrict the phase space to the states fulﬁlling the fundamental equation for
electrodynamics of moving particles.

F

Our main result consists in the Theorem 5 which says, that on the reduced phase
space the symplectic 2-form becomes strongly nondegenerate. This nice mathematical result
enables one to deﬁne the Poisson bracket structure in the space of functionals over the
reduced phase space. To our knowledge the above Poisson bracket structure is the ﬁrst fully

3

consistent structure for the theory of interacting particles and ﬁelds, i. e. when the particles
and ﬁelds variables are kept at the same footing.

The paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 contains the main results of the new approach to classical electrodynamics of

point particles proposed in [6].

In Section 3 we present a new technique, developed in [7], which enables us to describe
at the same footing the ﬁeld and the particle’s degrees of freedom. For this purpose we
formulate the Hamiltonian structure of any relativistic, hyperbolic ﬁeld theory with respect
to a non-inertial reference frame deﬁned as a rest-frame for an arbitrarily moving observer.
In Section 4 we show how to extend the above approach to the case of electrodynamical

ﬁeld interacting with point particles.

For the reader convenience we present in Section 5 a new Hamiltonian structure for
Maxwell electrodynamics. The new electrodynamical Hamiltonian corresponds to a sym-
metric energy-momentum tensor and it is related via a simple Legendre transformation with
electrodynamical Lagrangian derived in [7].

Next three Sections present consistent Hamiltonian structure for electrodynamics of a
point particle, i. e. we derive the quasi-local Hamiltonian and ﬁnd the well deﬁned formula
for the Poisson bracket. In Section 9 we show that the above Poisson bracket structure is
consistent with Poincar´e algebra structure of relativistic theory.

Finally, in Section 10 we present the Hamiltonian formulation for the particle interacting
not only with the radiation ﬁeld, but also with a ﬁxed, external potential, produced by a
heavy external device. This is a straightforward extension of our theory, where the homoge-
neous boundary condition for the radiation ﬁeld is replaced by an inhomogeneous condition,
the inhomogeneity being provided by the external ﬁeld.

2 The new approach to electrodynamics of a point par-

ticle

In the present Section we brieﬂy sketch the new approach to electrodynamics of a point
particle presented in [6].

Let y = q(t) with t = y0, be the coordinate description of a time-like world line ζ of a
charged particle with respect to a laboratory frame, i.e. to a system (yµ), µ = 0, 1, 2, 3; of
Lorentzian space-time coordinates.

The theory contains as a main part the standard Maxwell equations with point-like

sources:

∂[λfµν] = 0 ,
∂µf µν = euνδζ ,

(2.1)

where uν stands for the particle four-velocity and δζ denotes the δ-distribution concentrated
on the smooth world line ζ:

δζ(y0, yk) =

(v(y0))2 δ(3)(yk

qk(y0)) .

−

1
q

−

4

Here v = (vk) = ( ˙qk) is the corresponding 3-velocity and v2 denotes the square of its 3-
dimensional length (we use the Heaviside-Lorentz system of units with c = 1). In the case
of many particles the total current is a sum of contributions corresponding to many disjoint
world lines and the value of charge is assigned to each world line separately.

For a given particle’s trajectory, equations (2.1) deﬁne a deterministic theory. This means
that initial data for the electromagnetic ﬁeld uniquely determine its evolution. However, if
we want to treat also the particle‘s initial data (q,v) as dynamical variables, the theory
based on the Maxwell equations alone is no longer deterministic: the particle‘s trajectory
can be arbitrarily modiﬁed in the future or in the past without changing the initial data.

This non-completeness of the theory is usually attributed to the fact that the particle’s
equations of motion are still missing. However, it was proved in [6] that the ﬁeld initial data
fully determine the particle’s acceleration and this is due to Maxwell equations only, without
postulating any equations of motion. More precisely, there is a one-to-one correspondence
between the (r−1)-term of the ﬁeld in the vicinity of the particle and the acceleration of the
particle. The easiest way to describe this property of Maxwell theory is to use the particle’s
rest-frame. For this purpose consider the 3-dimensional hyperplane Σt orthogonal to ζ at
the point (t, q(t))
ζ. We shall call Σt the “rest frame hyperplane”. Choose on Σt any
system (xi) of cartesian coordinates centered at the particle’s position and denote by r the
corresponding radial coordinate. The initial data for the ﬁeld on Σt are given by the electric
induction ﬁeld D = (Di) and the magnetic induction ﬁeld B = (Bi) fulﬁlling the conditions
div B = 0 and div D = e δ(3)
0 . Maxwell equations can be solved for arbitrary data, fulﬁlling
the above constraints, but the solution will be usually non-regular, even far away from the
particles. To avoid singularities propagating over a light cone from (t, q(t)), the singular
part of the data in the vicinity of the particle has to be equal to

+ O(1) ,

(2.2)

where a = (ak) is the acceleration of the particle (in the rest frame we have a0 = 0) and
O(1) denotes the nonsingular part of the ﬁeld (the magnetic ﬁeld Bk(r) cannot contain any
singular part). This gives the one-to-one correspondence between the (r−1)-term of the ﬁeld
and the particle’s acceleration, which is implied by the regularity of the ﬁeld outside of the
trajectory ζ.
Hence,

for regular solutions, the time derivatives ( ˙D, ˙B, ˙q, ˙v) of the Cauchy data
(D, B, q, v) of the composed (ﬁelds + particle) system are uniquely determined by the data
˙D and ˙B are given by the Maxwell equations,
˙q = v and ˙v may be
themselves. Indeed,
uniquely calculated from equation (2.2). Nevertheless, the theory is not complete and its
evolution is not determined by the initial data. This non-completeness may be interpreted
as follows. Field evolution takes place not in the entire Minkowski space M, but only outside
the particle, i. e. in a manifold with a non-trivial boundary Mζ := M
. The boundary
conditions for the ﬁeld are still missing.

To ﬁnd this missing condition, the following method was used. Guided by an extended
particle model, an “already renormalized” formula was proposed in [6], which assigns to each
point (t, qk(t)) of the trajectory a four-vector pλ(t) according to

hypersurface passing through the point (t, q(t)).

ZΣ

(2.3)

It was proved in [6] that the four-vector (2.3) is well deﬁned and does not depend on
the particular choice of Σ.
It is interpreted as the total four-momentum of the physical
system composed of both the particle and the ﬁeld. For a generic trajectory ζ and a generic
solution of Maxwell equations (2.1) this quantity is not conserved, i. e. it depends upon t.
The conservation law

is proposed as an additional equation, which completes the theory. It was shown that, due to
Maxwell equations, only 3 among the 4 equations (2.4) are independent. Given a laboratory
reference frame, one may take e. g. the conservation of the momentum p = (pk):

as independent equations. They already imply the energy conservation d
In
Section 6 we will show, that the above momentum p is equal to the momentum canonically
conjugate to the position of the particle, whereas p0 is equal to the total Hamiltonian of the
composed (particle + ﬁeld) system.

dt p0(t) = 0.

It has been proved in [6] that, due to Maxwell equations, the integral (global) condition
(2.5) is equivalent to a (local) boundary condition for the behaviour of the Maxwell ﬁeld
in the vicinity of the trajectory. The condition was called the fundamental equation of the
electrodynamics of moving particles. In particle’s reference frame it may be formulated as
a relation between the (r−1) and the (r0) terms in the expansion of the radial component of
the electric ﬁeld in the vicinity of the particle:

Dr(r) =

α
r (cid:19)
0 like r or faster. For a given value of
where by O(r) we denote terms vanishing for r
r both sides of (2.6) are functions of the angles (only the r−2 term is angle–independent).
The relation between the acceleration and the (r−1) – term of the electric ﬁeld given in (2.2)
may be rewritten in terms of the component α of this expansion:

(it implies that the quadrupole and the higher harmonics of α must vanish for regular

THEOREM 1 The conservation law (2.5) is equivalent to the following boundary condition

where DP(f ) denotes the dipole part of the function f on the sphere S2.

The main result of [6] may be summarised in the following

3 Hamiltonian description of a relativistic ﬁeld theory

in the co-moving frame

3.1 Deﬁnition of the co-moving frame

To construct the Hamiltonian formulation of the above theory, we will need a Hamiltonian
description of electrodynamics with respect to the particle’s rest-frame. In [7] it was shown
how to extend the standard variational formulation of ﬁeld theory to the case of non-inertial
frames (for the deﬁnition of the co-moving frame see also [8]). In the present Section we
show how to extend the standard Hamiltonian formulation of a classical ﬁeld theory.

Consider any ﬁeld theory based on a ﬁrst-order relativistically-invariant Lagrangian den-

sity

L = L(ψ, ∂ψ) ,

(3.1)

where ψ is a (possibly multi-index) ﬁeld variable, which we do not need to specify at the
moment. As an example, ψ could denote a scalar, a spinor or a tensor ﬁeld.

We will describe the above ﬁeld theory with respect to accelerated reference frames,
related with observers moving along arbitrary space-time trajectories. Let ζ be such a
(time-like) trajectory, describing the motion of our observer. Let yk = qk(t), k = 1, 2, 3; be
the description of ζ with respect to a laboratory reference frame, i. e. to a system (yλ), λ =
0, 1, 2, 3; of Lorentzian space-time coordinates. We will construct an accelerated reference
frame, co-moving with ζ. For this purpose let us consider at each point (t, q(t))
ζ the
3-dimensional hyperplane Σt orthogonal to ζ, i.e. orthogonal to the four-velocity vector
U(t) = (uµ(t)):

∈

(uµ) = (u0, uk) := γ(1, vk) ,

(3.2)

where vk := ˙qk and the relativistic factor γ := 1/√1
v2. We shall call Σt the “rest frame
surface”. Choose on Σt any system (xi) of cartesian coordinates, such that the particle is
located at its origin (i. e. at the point xi = 0).

−

7

Let us consider space-time as a disjoint sum of rest frame surfaces Σt, each of them
corresponding to a speciﬁc value of the coordinate x0 := t and parameterized by the coor-
dinates (xi). This way we obtain a system (xα) = (x0, xk) of “co-moving” coordinates in a
neighbourhood of ζ. Unfortunately, it is not always a global system because diﬀerent Σ’s
may intersect. Nevertheless, we will use it globally to describe the evolution of the ﬁeld ψ
from one Σt to another. For a hyperbolic ﬁeld theory, initial data on one Σt imply the entire
ﬁeld evolution. We are allowed, therefore, to describe this evolution as a 1-parameter family
of ﬁeld initial data over subsequent Σ’s.

Formally, we will proceed as follows. We consider an abstract space-time M := T
Σ
deﬁned as the product of an abstract time axis T = R1 with an abstract, three dimensional
Euclidean space Σ = R3. Given a world-line ζ, we will need an identiﬁcation of points of M
with points of physical space-time M. Such an identiﬁcation is not unique because on each
Σt we have still the freedom of an O(3)-rotation.

×

Suppose, therefore, that an identiﬁcation F has been chosen, which is local with respect
to the observer’s trajectory. By locality we mean that, given the position and the velocity
of the observer at the time t, the isometry

F(q(t),v(t)) : Σ

Σt

7→

is already deﬁned, which maps 0

Σ into the particle position (t, q(t))

As an example of such an isometry which is local with respect to the trajectory we
could take the one obtained as follows. Choose the unique boost transformation relating the
laboratory time axis ∂/∂y0 with the observer’s proper time axis U. Next, deﬁne the position
of the ∂/∂xk - axis on Σt by transforming the corresponding ∂/∂yk – axis of the laboratory
frame by the same boost. It is easy to check, that the resulting formula for F reads:

Σt.

the argument v2 of the function ϕ).

Suppose, therefore, that for a given trajectory ζ a local isometry (3.3) has been chosen,
which deﬁnes Fζ : M
M. This mapping is usually not invertible: diﬀerent points of M
may correspond to the same point of space-time M because diﬀerent Σt’s may intersect. It
enables us, however, to deﬁne the metric tensor on M as the pull-back F ∗

metric. The components gαβ of the above metric are deﬁned by the derivatives of Fζ, i. e. they
depend upon the ﬁrst and the second derivatives of the position q(t) of our observer.

Because (xk) are cartesian coordinates on Σ, the space-space components of g are trivial:
gij = δij. The only non-trivial components of g are, therefore, the lapse function and the
(purely rotational) shift vector:

N =

Nm = g0m = γ−1ǫmklωkxl ,

√

−

= γ−1(1 + aixi) ,

where ai is the observer’s acceleration vector in the co-moving frame. The quantity ωm is
a rotation, which depends upon the coordination of isometries (3.3) between diﬀerent Σt’s.
Because ωm depends locally upon the trajectory, it may also be calculated in terms of the
velocity and the acceleration of the observer, once the identiﬁcation (3.3) has been chosen.
In the case of example (3.4), it is easy to check that

where

ai = ai

k ˙vk ,

ωm = ωml ˙vl ,

ωml := γϕvkǫklm ,

and ˙vk is the observer’s acceleration in the laboratory frame.

The metric F ∗

ζ g is degenerate at singular points of the identiﬁcation map (i.e. where the
identiﬁcation is locally non-invertible because adjacent Σ’s intersect, i. e. where N = 0), but
this degeneration does not produce any diﬃculties in what follows.

3.2 Lagrango-Hamiltonian

Once we know the metric (3.7) on M, we may rewrite the invariant Lagrangian density L of
the ﬁeld theory under consideration, just as in any other curvilinear system of coordinates.
The Lagrangian obtained this way depends on the ﬁeld ψ, its ﬁrst derivatives, but also on
the observer’s position, velocity and acceleration. Variation with respect to ψ produces ﬁeld
equations in the co-moving system (xα). Due to the relativistic invariance of the theory,
variation of the Lagrangian with respect to the observer’s position q should not produce
independent equations but only conservation laws, implied already by the ﬁeld equations.

For our purposes we will keep, however, at the same footing the ﬁeld degrees of freedom
ψ and (at the moment, physically irrelevant) observer’s degrees of freedom qk. We are going
to perform the complete “Hamiltonization” of this theory, i.e. to pass to the Hamiltonian
description both in ﬁeld and observer’s variables.

9

Let us ﬁrst perform a partial Legendre transformation, and pass to the Hamiltonian
description of the ﬁeld degrees of freedom, keeping the Lagrangian description of the “me-
chanical” degrees of freedom. For this purpose we deﬁne

where Π is the momentum canonically conjugate to ψ:

LH := L

Π ˙ψ ,

−

Π :=

∂L
∂ ˙ψ

.

(3.11)

(3.12)

The function LH plays the role of a Hamiltonian (with negative sign) for the ﬁelds and a
Lagrangian for the observer’s position q. It is an analog of the Routhian function in analytical
mechanics (cf. [7]). The Lagrango-Hamiltonian LH generates the Hamiltonian ﬁeld evolution
with respect to the accelerated frame, when the “mechanical degrees of freedom” qk are ﬁxed.
Due to (3.7), this evolution is a superposition of the following three transformations:

time-translation in the direction of the local time-axis of the observer,

boost in the direction of the acceleration ak of the observer,

purely spatial O(3)-rotation ωm.

•

•

•

It is, therefore, obvious that the numerical value of the generator LH of such an evolution is
equal to

generator is necessary, because the time t = x0, which we used to parameterize the observer’s
trajectory, is not the proper time along ζ but the laboratory time.

3.3 Legendre transformation and relativistic invariance

Now, we perform the Legendre transformation also with respect to the observer’s degrees of
freedom, and ﬁnd this way the complete Hamiltonian of the entire (observer + ﬁeld) system.
Let us observe that LH is a 2-nd order Lagrangian in the observer’s variable:

LH = LH(q, v, ˙v, ﬁelds) ,

(3.14)

(for the Hamiltonian description of a theory arising from a 2-nd order Lagrangian see Ap-
pendix A. A general discussion of a Hamiltonian formalism arising from higher order La-
grangians may be found in [16] - [18]). Let pk and πk denote the momenta canonically
conjugated to qk and vk respectively. The phase space of the entire system, parameterized

10

by (qk, vk, pk, πk) in the observer’s sector and by (ψ, Π) in the ﬁeld sector, is endowed with
the canonical symplectic 2-form:

The observer’s acceleration ˙v plays in (3.20) the role of Lagrangian multiplier. To reduce the

has to ﬁnd the complete hierarchy of constraints via so called Dirac-Bergmann procedure
(cf. [12] - [14]).

the “true” degrees of freedom, namely those describing the ﬁeld. Fixing the trajectory plays
the role of “gauge ﬁxing” and the “evolution equations” of the observer are automatically
satisﬁed if the ﬁeld equations are satisﬁed.

This result is an obvious consequence of the relativistic invariance of the theory. Ob-

server’s parameters are not true degrees of freedom and can be easily “gauged away”.

4 Renormalized electrodynamical Routhian

We would like to apply the formalism presented in the previous Section for the Hamiltonian
description of electrodynamics of a point particle. It turns out that the use of the particle’s
rest-frame simpliﬁes considerably the formulation of the theory. Hence we will use not an
arbitrary observer, but the one following exactly the particle’s trajectory. As a consequence,
the trajectory will no longer be a gauge parameter, but will have an independent, dynamical
meaning, as a new degree of freedom of the theory.

Let us observe that starting from the Lagrangian descripton of electrodynamics given by
the standard Maxwell Lagrangian, the Legendre transformation (3.11) does not lead to the
correct local expression for the ﬁeld energy (we obtain the “canonical Hamiltonian” which
diﬀers from the ﬁeld energy by a complete divergence). However, in the “ﬁeld sector” we
may already start with the electrodynamical Routhian (Lagrango-Hamiltonian) (3.13). To
Rk and Sm the conventional energy, static moment and
obtain this generator we take as
angular momentum of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. These quantities are deﬁned as appropriate
integrals of the components of the symmetric energy-momentum tensor:

ν = f µλfνλ −

In the Section 5 we construct the Hamiltonian structure of Maxwell electrodynamics which
is perfectly suited for the formalism introduced in the previous Section. In particular, the
is deﬁned as an
“new Hamiltonian” is positive deﬁnite and equals to the ﬁeld energy, i.e.
integral of T µ
ν.

When one adds a point particle to the electromagnetic ﬁeld, then, obviously, the total ﬁeld
energy is not well deﬁned due to the singularity of the particle’s Coulomb ﬁeld. Therefore,
one has to perform renormalization. Decomposing the electric induction ﬁeld on the rest-
frame surface Σt into the sum

of the Coulomb ﬁeld D0 = er
for the renormalized rest-frame quantities (see [6] and [7] for details):

4πr3 and the remaining part D, we obtain the following formulae

LH gives the Euler-Lagrange equations which are equivalent to the fundamental equation
(2.8).

5 The new gauge-invariant Hamiltonian structure of

Maxwell electrodynamics

In ﬁeld theory, contrary to the classical mechanics, there is no unique way to represent the
ﬁeld evolution as an inﬁnite-dimensional Hamiltonian system (see [10] and [11]). Each such
representation is based on a speciﬁc choice of controlling the boundary value of the ﬁeld, and
corresponds to a speciﬁc choice of the Hamiltonian. This non-uniqueness is implied by the
non-uniqueness of the evolution of the portion of the ﬁeld, contained in a ﬁnite laboratory
V .
Indeed, the evolution is not unique because external devices may inﬂuence the ﬁeld
through the open windows of our laboratory. To choose the Hamiltonian uniquely, we have
to insulate the laboratory or, at least, to specify the inﬂuence of the external world on it.
One may easily imagine an unsuccessful insulation, which does not prevent the external ﬁeld
from penetrating the laboratory. From our point of view, an insulation is suﬃcient if it keeps
under control a complete set of ﬁeld data on the boundary ∂V in such a way, that the ﬁeld
evolution becomes mathematically unique.
For relatively simple theories (e.g.

scalar ﬁeld theory) the Dirichlet problem may be
treated as a privileged one among all possible mixed (initial value + boundary value) prob-
lems which are well posed. It turns out (see [10]) that the Dirichlet problem leads to the
positive deﬁnite Hamiltonian. This means that there is a natural way to insulate the labo-
ratory V adiabatically from the external world. But already in electrodynamics (and even
more in General Relativity) any attempt to deﬁne the ﬁeld Hamiltonian leads immediately
to the question: how do we really deﬁne our Hamiltonian system?

g33 = 1 ,

g11 = r2 ,

But there is also a boundary term in (5.3), typical for ﬁeld theory. Killing this term by an
appropriate choice of boundary conditions is necessary for transforming the ﬁeld theory into
an (inﬁnite dimensional) dynamical system (see [9], [10]). Thus, boundary conditions for
∂V make the electrodynamics equivalent to the inﬁnite-dimensional Hamil-
A0|
tonian system. From the mathematical point of view this is the missing part of the deﬁnition
of the functional space. The Hamiltonian structure of Maxwell electrodynamics described
above is mathematically well deﬁned, i.e. a mixed Cauchy problem (Cauchy data given on Σt
R) has an unique solution (modulo gauge tranformations
and Dirichlet data given on ∂V
×
which reduce to the identity on ∂V

R).

×

5.2 The new approach

It turns out that there is another Hamiltonian structure which is also mathematically well
deﬁned (see [11], [10]). Moreover, it possesses very nice properties from the physical point
of view:

1. the new Hamiltonian corresponds to the ﬁeld energy obtained from the symmetric
2(D2 + B2) in the laboratory frame, which, contrary to

energy-momentum tensor, i.e 1
the canonical Hamiltonian, is positive deﬁnite,

2. this structure is perfectly suited for the reduction of the theory with respect to the

Hamiltonian constraint Dk,k = 0 , i.e. Gauss law (see [11]).

important role in further considerations and all the dynamical ﬁeld quantities of the theory
will belong to this space. To ﬁx both terms in (5.7) uniquely we choose u in such a way that
the mean value of (A3 −

grees of freedom described by four functions:
described by six functions Ak and Dk). Two of them will play the role of ﬁeld conﬁgurations
and the remaining two will be the conjugate momenta. Let us consider a boundary term
in (5.7). Killing this term by an appropriate choice of boundary conditions is necessary for
transforming the ﬁeld theory into an (inﬁnite dimensional) dynamical system (see [9], [10]).
¿From this point of view, the quantity v (or, equivalently B3) is a good candidate for the
ﬁeld conﬁguration, since controlling it at the boundary will kill the term δv in the boundary
integral. On the contrary, δA0 can not be killed by any simple boundary condition imposed
03 = λD3 than A3, which has to be chosen as another
on A3. We conclude, that it is rather
ﬁeld conﬁguration.

We see that (D3, B3) play the role of ﬁeld conﬁgurations, whereas the remaining functions
(BA||BǫAB, DA||BǫAB) describe the conjugate momenta. Controlling the conﬁgurations at the
boundary we kill the surface integral over ∂V and obtain this way an inﬁnite dimensional
Hamiltonian system describing the ﬁeld evolution. There is, however, a problem with such a
control, because the electric induction D3 cannot be controlled freely on the boundary. The
reason is that the total electric ﬂux through both components of ∂V (i. e. through S(r0) and
through the sphere at inﬁnity) must be the same:

03 =

03 = e ,

(5.16)

ZS(r0) F

ZS(r∞) F
where e is the electric charge contained in S(r0). Hence, we have to separate the monopole-
free (“radiative”) part of D3 (which can be independently controlled on both ends of V ) from
the information about the electric charge. For this purpose we split the electric induction
D3 into

D3 =

e

4πr2 + D3 ,

3

where D
is again a monopole-free function. It follows from (5.16) that the monopole part
of D3 (equal to e/4πr2) is nondynamical and drops out from the volume integral of (5.4)
because it is multiplied by a monopole-free function BA||BǫAB. The remaining part D
(which
does not carry any information about the charge e), together with B3, can be taken as the
true, unconstrained degrees of freedom of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.

3

In the same way we split the scalar potential A0:

A0 = φ + A0 ,

where φ(r) is the mean value of A0 on the sphere S(r) (monopole part) and A0 is a monopole–
free function (“radiative” part of A0). Now, the boundary term A0δD3 in (5.4) reads

λA0δD3 =

λr−2φδe +

λA0δD3 .

Finally, we perform the Legendre transformation between φ and the monopole part of D3 at

at inﬁnity. Since the latter does not contain any physical information and is used only to ﬁx
the residual gauge, we may use the simplest possible choice: φ(

for the renormalized functionals. This does not mean that renormalized electrodynamics is
incompatible with the special theory of relativity. Notice, that already in the context of
inhomogeneous Maxwell theory with given point-like sources, ﬁeld functionals do not form
the Poincar´e algebra but the theory is obviously relativistically invariant. We have shown
in Section 3 that the Poincar´e algebra structure is equivalent to the fact that the Legendre
transformation (3.11) leads to the Hamiltonian theory with ﬁrst class constraints. A theory
which is subjected to the ﬁrst class constraints is a gauge-type theory. Now, we expect
that the particle’s trajectory is no longer a gauge parameter but plays a dynamical role.
Therefore, the “breaking” of the Poincar´e algebra structure is the necessary condition for
the nontrivial particle’s dynamics.

To eﬀectively reduced

we shall proceed as follows: we consider particle’s trajectory ζ
as a limiting case of a tiny world-tube of radius r0. Therefore, calculating Poisson brackets
according to (6.2) we shall keep r0 > 0 and then ﬁnally go to the limit r0 →

The simplest parametrization is the following: ﬁeld sector is still parameterized by ΨA and

It was shown in [6] that the “fundamental equation” is equivalent to the total momentum
conservation. In the Lagrangian formulation of the theory [7] this equation is nothing else
that the Euler-Lagrange equation of the variational problem. Now, in the Hamiltonian
formulation, the “fundamental equation” is already present in the deﬁnition of the phase
space of the system and the name “fundamental” is fully justiﬁed.

A Canonical formalism for a 2-nd order Lagrangian

Consider a theory described by the 2-nd order lagrangian L = L(q, ˙q, ¨q) (to simplify the
notation we skip the index “i” corresponding to diﬀerent degrees of freedom qi; extension
of this approach to higher order Lagrangians is straightforward).
Introducing auxiliary
variables v = ˙q we can treat our theory as a 1-st order one with lagrangian constraints

28

φ := ˙q
following relation:

−

v = 0 on the space of lagrangian variables (q, ˙q, v, ˙v). Dynamics is generated by the

(p dq + π dv) = ˙p dq + p d ˙q + ˙π dv + π d ˙v .

(A.1)

d

where (p, π) are momenta canonically conjugate to q and v respectively. Because L is deﬁned
only on the constraint submanifold, its derivative dL is not uniquely deﬁned and has to be
understood as a collection of all the covectors which are compatible with the derivative of
the function along constraints. This means that the left hand side is deﬁned up to µ( ˙q
v),
where µ are Lagrange multipliers corresponding to constraints φ = 0 . We conclude that
p = λ is an arbitrary covector and (A.1) is equivalent to the system of dynamical equations:

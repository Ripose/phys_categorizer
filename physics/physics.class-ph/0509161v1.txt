Space-time trigonometry and formalization of the “Twin
Paradox” for uniform and accelerated motions

Dino Boccaletti∗, Francesco Catoni,
Vincenzo Catoni†,

February 2, 2008

Abstract - The formal structure of the early Einstein’s Special Relativity follows the axiomatic
deductive method of Euclidean geometry. In this paper we show the deep-rooted relation between
Euclidean and space-time geometries that are both linked to a two-dimensional number system: the
complex and hyperbolic numbers, respectively.
By studying the properties of these numbers together, pseudo-Euclidean trigonometry has been
formalized with an axiomatic deductive method and this allows us to give a complete quantitative
formalization of the twin paradox in a familiar “Euclidean” way for uniform motions as well as for
accelerated ones.

4 of the famous Einstein’s 1905 special relativity paper [1] contains the sentences
The ﬁnal part of
concerning moving clocks on which volumes have been written: “..
If we assume that the result
proved for a polygonal line is also valid for a continuously curved line, we obtain the theorem: If one
of two synchronous clocks at A is moved in a closed curve with constant velocity until it returns to
A, the journey lasting t seconds, then the clock that moved runs 1
2 t
seconds [2] slower than the
one that remained at rest”.
About six years later, on 10 April 1911, at the Philosophy Congress at Bologna, Paul Langevin
replaced the clocks A and B with human observers and “twin paradox” oﬃcially was born.
Langevin, using the example of a space traveller who travels a distance L (measured by someone
at rest on the earth) in a straight line to a star in one year and than abruptly turns around and
returns on the same line, wrote: “..Revenu `a la Terre ayant vielli deux ans, il sortira de son arche
et trouvera notre globe vielli deux cents ans si sa vitesse est rest´ee dans l’interval inf´erieure d’un
vingt-milli`eme seulement `a la vitesse de la lumi`ere.”[3] We must remark that Langevin, besides not
rejecting ether’s existence, stresses the point which will be the subject of the subsequent discussions,
that is the asymmetry between the two reference frames.
The space traveller undergoes an acceleration halfway of his journey, while the twin at rest in the
earth reference frame always remains in an inertial frame.
For Langevin, every acceleration has an absolute meaning. Even though the eﬀect foreseen by Ein-
stein’s theory has got several experimental conﬁrmations, the contribution of accelerated stretches
of the path still stands as a subject of discussion and controversies.
Aiming to not causing misunderstandings, we stress that the discussions we allude are rigorously
conﬁned to the ambit of special relativity, that is to the space-time of special relativity.
It is in this ambit that Rindler says: “...If an ideal clock moves nonuniformly through an inertial
frame, we shall assume that acceleration as such has no eﬀect on the rate of the clock, i.e., that its
instantaneous rate depends only on its instantaneous speed v according to the above rule. Unfortu-
nately, there is no way of proving this. Various eﬀects of acceleration on a clock would be consistent
with S. R. Our assumption is one of simplicity - or it can be regarded as a deﬁnition of an “ideal”
clock. We shall call it the clock hypothesis.” [4].
We think that a conclusion on the role of the accelerated motions and, most of all, an evaluation of
the amount of the slowing down of an accelerated clock can only be reached through a rigorous and
exhaustive exploitation of the mathematics of special relativity.
If the theory has no logical inconsistencies, the theory itself must thereby provide a completely ac-
curate account of the asymmetrical aging process.
Even if Minkowski gave a geometrical interpretation of the special relativity space-time shortly after
(1907-1908) Einstein’s fundamental paper, a mathematical tool exploitable in the context of the
Minkowski space-time has begun to be carried out only few decades ago ([5]-[10]).
This mathematical tool is based on the use of hyperbolic numbers, introduced by S. Lie in the late
XIX century [11].
In analogy with the procedures applied in the case of complex numbers, it is possible to formalize,
also for the hyperbolic numbers, a space-time geometry and a trigonometry following the same Eu-
clidean axiomatic-deductive method [10, 12].
In this paper, we ﬁrst summarize the introduction of the hyperbolic space-time trigonometry and
then apply it to formalize the twin paradox for inertial motions as well as for accelerated ones.
The self-consistency of the method allows us to solve any problem in the Minkowski space-time
through an elementary approach as if we were working on Euclidean plane.
We would conclude this introduction with an epistemological consideration which, in the centenary

2

of special relativity, turns out to be a recognition of the Einstein’s insight.
We know that Einstein formalized special relativity by starting from two axioms and applying the
axiomatic-deductive method of Euclidean geometry [1].
Euclid’s geometry and special relativity are both associated with group theory and, in the same way,
to complex and hyperbolic numbers [8] at the extent that we can say: Euclidean geometry and the
geometry of Minkowski space-time are both deriving from a second degree algebraic equation [5, 13].
In particular:
1. from square roots of negative quantities we have complex numbers and Euclidean geometry;
2. from square roots of positive quantities we have hyperbolic numbers and Minkowski space-time
geometry.
Then these two geometries have a common source and for this reason can be considered as equivalent.
Perhaps the “ingenious intuition” of the general laws of nature let him guess an incredible equivalence
in spite of the apparent diﬀerences.

2 Hyperbolic trigonometry

2.1 Basic deﬁnitions

Complex numbers are strictly related to Euclidean geometry: indeed their invariant (the modulus) is
the same as the Pythagoric distance (Euclidean invariant) and their unimodular multiplicative group
is the Euclidean rotation group. As it is known these properties allow us to use complex numbers
for representing plane vectors.
In the same way hyperbolic numbers, an extension of complex numbers [5, 14] deﬁned as

z = t + h x; h2 = 1 t, x

{

R; h /
∈

R

,

}

∈

are strictly related to space-time geometry [8, 10]. Indeed their modulus is given by (we call ˜z = t
the hyperbolic conjugate of z as for complex numbers)

≡
and if t is given the physical meaning of a normalized time variable (the speed of light c = 1) and
x the meaning of a space variable, then Eq. (1) is the Lorentz invariant of two dimensional special
relativity [6]. Moreover their unimodular multiplicative group is the special relativity Lorentz’s group
[6, 8].
Then hyperbolic numbers represent for space-time plane the same complex numbers represent for
Euclidean plane. Thanks to this correspondence and by pointing out the analogies and the diﬀerences
with these two number systems, the space-time trigonometry has been formalized with the same
rigour as Euclidean one [10], [12].
In fact the theorems of Euclidean trigonometry are usually obtained through elementary geometry
observations. Otherwise we can deﬁne in a Cartesian plane the trigonometric functions directly from
Euclid’s rotation group (as shown in the appendix A.1) and, as a consequence, the trigonometry
theorems will follow just as mathematical identities. Now since we know that the Lorentz group
enjoys, for space-time geometry, the same invariance property as the rotation group does for Euclidean
geometry, we can introduce in a Cartesian plane the hyperbolic trigonometric functions through
the properties of Lorentz group described by hyperbolic numbers [10]. The importance of this
introduction relies on the fact that we do not have for pseudo-Euclidean geometry the same intuitive
vision we have for Euclidean geometry. The obtained results and their complete coherence will
provide a Euclidean picture of pseudo-Euclidean geometry.

3

This picture can be considered analogous to the representation, on a Cartesian plane, of the surface
diﬀerential geometry by means of the distance between two points given by the Lorentz invariant
In this plane the Lorentz
(space-time interval or proper time), instead of the Pythagorean one.
transformations (uniform motions) are represented by straight-lines, and the curved lines represent
non-uniform (accelerated) motions [8]. In particular the constant accelerated motions are given by
an arm of equilateral hyperbola. [15, 16]

Here we brieﬂy summarize some fundamental properties of hyperbolic numbers.

This number system has been introduced by S. Lie [11] as a two dimensional example of the more
general class of the commutative hypercomplex numbers systems [13].

Now let us introduce a hyperbolic plane on the analogy of the Gauss-Argand plane of the complex
variable. In this plane we associate the point P
(t, x) to the hyperbolic number z = t + h x. If
≡
we represent this number on a Cartesian plane, in this plane the square of z distance (D2) from the
origin of the coordinate axes is deﬁned as

D2 = z ˜z

x2 = 0, i.e., when x =

˜z/z˜z. This implies
Let us consider the multiplicative inverse of z that, if existing, is given by: 1/z
t, or alternatively when
that z does not have an inverse when z˜z
z = t
h t. These two straight-lines in the hyperbolic plane, whose elements have no inverses, divide
the hyperbolic plane in four sectors that can be called Right sector (Rs), Up sector (Us), Left sector
(Ls), and Down sector (Ds). This property is the same as that of the Minkowski plane and this
correspondence assigns the physical meaning of proper time (space-time interval) to the deﬁnition of
distance [15]. Let us now consider the quantity t2
x2, which is positive in the Rs, Ls (
x
)
|
sectors, and negative in the Us, Ds (
) sectors. This quantity, as known from special relativity,
must have its sign and appear in this quadratic form. In particular, in the case we had to use the
linear form √t2
x2, (the modulus of hyperbolic numbers, or the triangle side length), we will follow
the deﬁnition of Yaglom ([5] p. 180) and Chabat ([14] p. 51), and take the absolute value of argument

2.2 Basic relations in the pseudo-Euclidean triangles

The guide-lines for “Euclidean” formalization of space-time trigonometry are summarized in appendix
A. An exhaustive treatment of this subject can be found in [10]. Here we only report the conclusions
which allow us to formalize the twin paradox.
As a matter of fact the same laws that hold for Euclidean trigonometry are true for pseudo-Euclidean
trigonometry and the latter can be obtained from the former by means of the following substitutions
[10]
1 ) Euclidean distance x2 + y2
2 ) Circular angles
3 ) The straight-lines equations are expressed by means of hyperbolic trigonometric functions [17].
Moreover, all the theorems that hold in Euclidean geometry for the circle (invariant curve [5]) are
changed in the same ones for equilateral hyperbolas (invariant curve for pseudo-Euclidean plane [6]).
In particular, the equation of an equilateral hyperbola depends on three conditions, that can be the
same we require to determine a circle in a Cartesian plane.
As a function of the center coordinates (tC, xC) and the diameter (2 p), it is given by

or, in parametric form, by Eq. (16) of the next section.

Now we recall the theorems that will be used in this paper. We call ρi, for i = 1, 2, 3, the lengths
of three sides of a triangle, θi the opposite angles to ρi, 2 p the “diameter” of the equilateral hyperbola
“circumscribed” to the triangle; we have

From a mathematical point of view, with the extension of the trigonometric hyperbolic functions

hyperbolic plane and allows us to consider triangles having sides in whatever direction [10][19]. As

(Rs) [15], and the hyperbolic functions are the classical ones, taking into account that the hyperbolic
angles can be measured, in particular for the parametric form of equilateral hyperbola, with respect
to a straight-line parallel to the x axis.
Moreover, since the above summary may result inadequate to make the reader familiar with hyper-
bolic trigonometry we preferred, in some examples, not to use directly the hyperbolic counterpart
of Euclidean theorems. We obtain the results by means of simple mathematics and afterwards show
the mentioned correspondence.

3 Mathematical formalization of the twin paradox

As we have already emphasized in the introduction, a consequence of the Lorentz transformations
is the so called “Twin paradox”. After a century this problem continues to be the subject of many
papers, not only relative to experimental tests [20] but also regarding physical and philosophical
considerations [21].
In this paper we want to show how the formalization of hyperbolic trigonometry [10] allows us, with
elementary mathematics, a formalization of this problem both for uniform and accelerated motions.

3.1

Inertial motions

≡

≡

(τ2, 0) [22]. In Fig. 1 we represent this problem by means of the triangle OT R.

In a representative t, x plane let us start with the following example: a twin is steady in the point
x = 0, his path is represented by the t axis. The other twin, on a rocket, starts with speed v from
O
(0, 0) and after a time τ1, at the point T , he reverses its direction and comes back arriving to
the point R
From a geometrical point of view we can compare the elapsed times for the twins by comparing the
“lengths” (proper times) of the sum OT + T R and of the side OR.
The qualitative interpretation is reported in many books and is easily explained by means of the
reverse triangle inequality in space-time geometry with respect to Euclidean geometry ([23] p. 130).
Also a graphical visualization can be easily performed considering that a segment must be reported
on another by means of an equilateral hyperbola, instead of Euclidean circle ([5] p. 190).

Now we will see that Euclidean formalization of space-time trigonometry [10] allows us to obtain

a simple quantitative formulation of the problem.

Let us call θ1 ≡
OT R. From their physical meaning the angles θ1 and θ2 are so that the straight-lines OT and
angle
T R are time-like [15] (in a Euclidean representation the angle of the straight-lines with the t axis
must be less than π/4).
Let us apply to the side OR the second cosine law (9); we have

It follows that the diﬀerence between the twins’ proper times ∆ τ is

Eq. (8) we have OT = 2 p sinh θ2; T R = 2 p sinh θ1, and
∆τ = 2 p (cosh θ1 sinh θ2 + cosh θ2 sinh θ1 −
Now we can consider the following problem: given θ1 + θ2 = const
θ1 and θ2, so that ∆ τ has its greatest value?

We have obtained the “intuitive Euclidean” solution that the greatest diﬀerence between the elapsed
times, i.e., the shortest proper-time for the moving twin, is obtained for θ1 = θ2. For these value Eq.
(11) corresponds to the well known solution [1]

Now we give a geometrical interpretation of this problem. From Eq. (10) we know that if θ1 +θ2 = C,
θ3 is constant too, then the posed problem is equivalent to: what can be the position of the vertex
T if the starting and ﬁnal points and the angle θ3 are given?
The problem is equivalent to have, in a triangle, a side and the opposite angle. In an equivalent
problem in Euclidean geometry we know at once that the vertex T does move on a circle arc. Then,
from the established correspondence of circles in Euclidean geometry to equilateral hyperbolas in
pseudo-Euclidean geometry, we have that in the present space-time problem the vertex T will move
on an arc of an equilateral hyperbola.

Now let us generalize the twin paradox to the case in which both twins change their state of
motion: their motions start in O, both twins move on (diﬀerent) straight-lines and cross again in R.
The graphical representation is given by a quadrilateral ﬁgure and we call T and T ′ the other two
vertices. Since a hyperbolic rotation of the triangle does not change the angles and the side lengths
[5, 10], we can rotate the ﬁgure so that the vertex R lies on the t axis (see Fig. 1). The problem can
be considered as a duplicate of the previous one in the sense that we can compare the proper times
of both twins with the side OR. If we indicate by (′) the quantities referred to the triangle under
the t axis, we apply Eq. (13) twice and obtain ∆τ
In particular if we have θ1 + θ2 = θ′
twin is the one for which θ1 and θ2 are closer to C/2.

Inertial and accelerated motions

Now we consider some “more realistic” examples in which uniformly accelerated motions are taken
into account. The geometrical representation of a motion with constant acceleration is given by an
arm of an equilateral hyperbola with the semi-diameter p linked to the acceleration a by the relation
p−1 = a ([15] p. 58, [16] p. 166, [24]).
Obviously, the geometrical representation of a motion with non-uniform acceleration is given by a
curve which is the envelope of the equilateral hyperbolas corresponding to the instantaneous accel-
erations. Or, vice versa, we can construct in every point of a curve an “osculating hyperbola” which
has the same properties of the osculating circle in Euclidean geometry. In fact the semi-diameter of
these hyperbolas is linked to the second derivative with respect to the line element ([23]
3.3) as the
radius of osculating circles in Euclidean geometry.
We also indicate by C
(tC, xC) its center and with θ a parameter that, from a geometrical point of
view, represents a hyperbolic angle measured with respect to an axis passing trough C and parallel
to x axis [6, 10].
Then its equation, in parametric form, is

This relation states the link between the proper time, the acceleration, and the hyperbolic angle
and also shows that hyperbolic angles are given by the ratio between the “lengths” of the hyperbola
arcs and the semidiameter as the circular angles in Euclidean trigonometry are given by the ratio
between circle arcs and radius. Moreover, as in Euclidean geometry, the magnitude of hyperbolic
angles is equal to twice the area of the hyperbolic sector [10] and, taking into account that the “area”
is the same quantity in Euclidean and pseudo-Euclidean geometries, it can be calculated in a simple
Euclidean way ([5] p. 183).
In point P , determined by θ = θ1, the velocity is given by v

From this equation we see that θ1 also represents the hyperbolic angle of the tangent to the hyperbola
with the t axis. This last property means that semi-diameter CP is pseudo-orthogonal to the tangent
in P (see also Fig. 3)[25]. This property corresponds, in Euclidean counter-part, to the well known
property of the circle where the radius is orthogonal to the tangent-line.

The proper time on this rounded oﬀ triangle is greater than the one on the triangle, as we shall
better see in the next example.
The physical interpretation is that the velocity on the hyperbola arc is less than the one on straight-
lines OT, T R of Fig. (1). From a geometrical point of view, it is a consequence of the reverse triangle
inequality or, in a more general way, we can say that the geodesic lines between two given points
(straight-lines) are the longest lines.

The twin that moves for a shorter time with uniform motion has the shortest proper time[28].
A simpliﬁed version (an inertial and an accelerated motion between two points) is given in [16] (ex-
ercise 6.3 p.167) and it is considered just as a consequence of the reverse triangle inequality.
With regard to the result of this example we could ask: how is it possible that a uniform motion
close to a light-line is the longer one? We can answer this question by a glance at Eq. (37). In fact in
this equation the denominator sinh θ1 ≫
1 takes into account that the motion is close to a light-line,
cosh θ1 indicates that crossing point B is so far that its contribution
but in the numerator cosh θ2 ≫
is the determining term of the result we have obtained.

4 Conclusions

As we know, the twin paradox spread far and wide having been considered the most striking exem-
pliﬁcation of the space-time “strangeness” of Einstein’s theory of special relativity. What we have
striven to show is that hyperbolic trigonometry supplies us with an easy tool by which one can deal
with any kinematic problem in the context of special relativity.
In fact, if we consider Einstein’s theory of special relativity as a logical-deductive construction based
on the two postulates of the constancy of light’s velocity and the equivalence of all inertial reference
frames for establishing physical laws, the hyperbolic space-time is the right mathematical structure
inside which any problem must be dealt with.
As we have seen, the use of hyperbolic trigonometry allows us to obtain the quantitative solution of
any problem and dispels all doubts regarding the role of acceleration in the ﬂow of time.
Finally, we remark that the application of hyperbolic trigonometry to relativistic space-time results
to be a “Euclidean way” of dealing with pseudo-Euclidean spaces.

gonometries by means of complex or hyperbolic numbers

For greater convenience of the reader we report a short exposition of paper [10]

A.1 Rotation invariants in Euclidean plane

Euclid’s geometry studies the ﬁgure properties that do not depend on their position in a plane.
If these ﬁgures are represented in a Cartesian plane we can say, in group language, that Euclid’s
geometry studies the invariant properties by coordinate axes roto-translations. It is well known that
these properties can be expressed by complex numbers. Let us consider Gauss-Argand’s complex
plane where a vector is represented by v = x + i y. The axes rotation of an angle α transforms this
vector in the new vector v′
v exp[iα]. Therefore we can promptly verify that the quantity (as it
≡
2 is invariant by axes
is usually done we call ¯v = x
rotation. In a similar way we ﬁnd two invariant quantities related to any couple of vectors.[29]
If we consider two vectors: v1 = x1 + iy1, v2 = x2 + iy2; we have that the real and the imaginary
part of the product v2¯v1 are invariant by axes rotation. In fact v

Now we will see that these two invariant quantities allow an operative deﬁnition of trigonometric

As it is well known the resulting real part of this product represents the scalar product, while the
“imaginary” part represents the modulus of the vector product, i.e., the area of the parallelogram
deﬁned by the two vectors.
The two invariant quantities of Eq. (41) allow an operative deﬁnition of trigonometric functions. In
fact in Cartesian coordinates we have:

v2 ¯v1 = (x2 + i y2)(x1 −

We know that the theorems of Euclid’s trigonometry are usually obtained by following a geometric
approach. Now by using the Cartesian representation of trigonometric functions given by Eqs. (43),
it is straightforward to control that the trigonometry theorems are simple identities. In fact let us
(xn, yn): from the coordinates of these
deﬁne a triangle in a Cartesian plane by its vertices Pn ≡
point we obtain the side lengths and, from Eqs. (43) the trigonometric functions. By these deﬁnitions
it is easy to control the identities deﬁned by the trigonometry theorems.

A.2 Hyperbolic rotation invariants in pseudo-Euclidean plane

By analogy with Euclid’s trigonometry approach summarised in appendix (A.1), we can say that
pseudo-Euclidean plane geometry studies the properties that are invariant by Lorentz transformations
(Lorentz-Poincar`e group of special relativity) corresponding to hyperbolic rotation as exposed in [8].
We show afterwards, how these properties can be represented by hyperbolic numbers.

Let us deﬁne in the hyperbolic plane a hyperbolic vector from the origin to the point P

(t, x), as
v = t+h x and consider a hyperbolic rotation of an angle θ that, from a physical point of view, means
−1 θ [6, 15]. From this transformation
a Lorentz transformation with a velocity given by V = tanh
the vector v become v′

v exp[h θ]. Therefore we can readily verify that the quantity:

|

|

≡

(44)

is invariant for hyperbolic rotation. In a similar way we can ﬁnd two invariants related to any couple
of vectors. Let us consider two vectors v1 = t1 + h x1 and v2 = t2 + h x2: we have that the real and
the “hyperbolic” parts of the product v2˜v1 are invariant by hyperbolic rotation.
In fact v′
v2 ˜v1. These two invariants allow an operative deﬁnition of
the hyperbolic trigonometric functions. To show this let us suppose that
and
t1, t2 > 0, and let us represent the two vectors in hyperbolic polar form (4): v1 = ρ1 exp[h θ1], v2 =
ρ2 exp[h θ2]. Consequently we have

(45)

As shown in appendix (A.1), for Euclidean plane the real part of the vector product represents the
scalar product, while the imaginary part represents the area of the parallelogram deﬁned by the two
vectors. In pseudo-Euclidean plane, as we know from diﬀerential geometry [30], the real part is still
the scalar product; as far as the hyperbolic part is concerned, we see in subsection (A.3) that it can
be considered as a pseudo-Euclidean area [5].
In Cartesian coordinates we have:

v2 ˜v1 = (t2 + h x2)(t1 −

These equations represent a bijective mapping between the points on unit circle (speciﬁed by φ) and
the points on unit hyperbolas (speciﬁed by θ). From a geometrical point of view Eq. (50) represent
the projection, from the coordinate axes origin, of the unit circle on the unit hyperbolas. From the
deﬁnitions of extended hyperbolic trigonometric functions of Eqs. (47, 48), we can state for triangle
in pseudo-Euclidean plane, exactly the same relations between sides and angles as the ones that hold
for Euclidean triangles [10].

In Euclidean geometry a quantity equivalent to S represents the area of the triangle. In pseudo-
Euclidean geometry S is still an invariant quantity linked to the triangle. For this reason it is
appropriate to call S pseudo-Euclidean area [5].
We note that the expression of area (Eq. 52), in terms of vertices coordinates, is exactly the same
as in Euclidean geometry (Gauss formula for a polygon area applied to a triangle).

[3] Langevin’s address to the Congress of Bologna was published on Scientia 10, 31-34 (1911).

As reported by Miller [1], the popularisation of relativity theory for philosophers had an imme-
diate impact which we can gauge from the comment of one of the philosophers present. Henry
Bergson (1922)wrote:
“..it was Langevin’s address to the Congress of Bologna on 10 April 1911 that ﬁrst drew our
attention to Einstein’s ideas. We are aware of what all those interested in the theory of relativity
owe to the works and teachings of Langevin.

[18] The value of coshe must be interpreted following table 1 in Appendix A.2.

[19] More precisely only sides directions parallel to axes bisectors have to be excluded.

[22] From a physical point of view the speed can not change in a null time, but this time can be

considered short with respect to τ1, τ2 ([15], pag. 41).
An experimental result with just uniform motion is reported in [20]. In this experiment the
lifetime of the muon in the CERN muon storage ring was measured.

[24] In [8] the hyperbolic motion is obtained as a straightforward consequence of the invariance of

the wave equation with respect to Lorentz transformations.

[25] We recall that two straight-line are pseudo-orthogonal if they are symmetric with respect to a

couple of lines parallel to the axes bisectors [10, 15].

[27] The following equation has an explicit solution for α = 2. In fact we have

cosh(θ2 −

θ1) = 2 sinh2 θ1 + 1

cosh 2 θ1 ⇒

≡

θ2 = 3 θ1.

[28] Since the total time is the same, shorter time with uniform motion means longer time with

accelerated motion, so this result is that of Eq. (27)

[29] Usually just one invariant quantity given by the scalar product is considered [9, 15]. The in-
troduction of a second one allows us to consider Euclidean trigonometry in a new way and to
formalize space-time trigonometry [10] as summarized in appendix A.2.

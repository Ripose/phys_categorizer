Covariant Irreducible Parametrization of Electromagnetic Fields
in Arbitrary Spacetime

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

We present a new uniﬁed covariant description of electromagnetic ﬁeld properties for an arbitrary
spacetime. We derive a unique complete set of irreducible components describing a six-dimensional
electromagnetic ﬁeld from the Maxwell and metric tensors using the symmetry group SL(2,C). For
the special case of a ﬂat spacetime metric the components are shown to correspond to the scalar
invariants of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, the energy-momentum-stress tensor and in addition, two
new tensors expressing physical observables of rank two and four respectively. We make a physical
interpretation of the new rank two tensor as describing a classical intrinsic spin of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The electromagnetic ﬁeld in Maxwells theory is since
long known to satisfy important symmetries and conse-
quently satisfy conservation laws. For example the con-
servation law T αβ
,β = 0 where T αβ is the usual energy-
momentum-stress tensor expresses the conservation of
energy, momentum (Poynting) and stress densities of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld in a (local) Minkowski space. How-
ever, these are not the only symmetries and conserved
quantities of physical relevance. In Minkowski space the
Maxwell equations are invariant under the important in-
homogeneous Lorentz group, or as sometimes called, the
Poincar´e group P(1,3). The ﬂat spacetime of Minkowski
space exhibits the maximum degree of symmetry one can
obtain.

Moving to the curved spacetime of general relativ-
ity many of the symmetries are lost, and conservation
laws applies only locally. A group arising naturally in
the study of general relativity is the group SL(2,C), the
group of complex unimodular 2x2 matrices. There exist
a homomorphism between SL(2,C) and the homogeneous
Lorentz group O(1,3), the group of orthogonal matrices

SL(2,C) → O(1,3),

(1)

reﬂecting the fact that SL(2,C) is the covering group of
O(1,3) and indicating how local Lorentz invariance is re-
tained.

In this paper we present a new uniﬁed treatment of the
symmetries of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in a general Rie-
mannian spacetime by calculating the irreducible com-
ponents of the covariant spectral density tensor. By per-
forming a Fourier transform in time and considering the
complex spectral densities we have further generalized to
wave ﬁelds.

In section (II) we deﬁne the problem of ﬁnding the ir-
reducible components by expressing the possible bilinear
forms of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in terms of the covari-
ant spectral density. We then translate this to an equiv-
alent problem under the group SL(2,C) by transform-
ing to the tangent spinor space. After decomposing the
spectral density spinor into irreducible components under
SL(2,C) we transform back to the equivalent tensors in
Riemann space. In section (III) we study the important
special case of a ﬂat spacetime and calculate the compo-
nents explicitly. Some of them are shown to correspond
to well known objects in Maxwells theory, while other
components obtained have not previously been found in
the litterature. Finally, in section (IV) we discuss our
conclusions and present ideas for future work.

II. SL(2,C) THEORY OF WAVE FIELD
SPECTRAL DENSITIES

A. Covariant spectral density tensor

The fundamental physical object describing the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld is the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor fµν
which is skew-symmetric in its two indicies

fµν = −fνµ.

(2)

It is comprised of the six components of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld. We wish to categorize an electromagnetic
wave ﬁeld and therefore decompose the electric and mag-
netic ﬁelds in their spectral components. Let f (t, r) de-
note either the electric ﬁeld E or magnetic ﬁeld H at a
point in space and time

f (t, r) = 

fx(t, r)
fy(t, r)
fz(t, r)



.

(3)


The Fourier transform in time, denoted by capital letters,
is then given by



F (ω, r) =

f (t, r)eiωt.

(4)

∞

Z

−∞

In the following we assume that the ﬁelds E, H and
hence the tensor Fµν are Fourier transformed according
to (4). This implies that the the tensor Fµν (ω, r) is now
complex. We form all possible bilinear forms of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld by constructing the outer product

where the σµ
AB′ -matrices are the Infeld van der Waerden
symbols, related to the metric tensor gµν by Eq. (A2).
We call the spinor SAB′CD′EF ′GH′ the spectral density
spinor. The symmetry condition Eq. (7a) and Eq. (8)
implies

2

which in tensor notation becomes

S = F ⊗ F †

Sαβγδ = FαβFδγ

(5)

(6)

where the bar denotes complex conjugate. We call the
complex tensor Sαβγδ in Eq. (6) the covariant spec-
tral density tensor. From its deﬁnition and the skew-
symmetry of Fµν , Eq. (2), the symmetries of Sαβγδ fol-
lows as

Sαβγδ = −Sβαγδ = −Sαβδγ = Sβαδγ

(7a)

Sαβγδ = Sγδαβ.

(7b)

The covariant spectral density tensor in Eq. (6) have
44 = 256 complex components, but only 36 of these are
independent due to the symmetries expressed in Eq. (7a).
This number is further decreased to half by the symmetry
in Eq. (7b). Accordingly, we ﬁnd that Sαβγδ behaves as
a six-dimensional hermitian matrix and has 36 indepen-
dent real valued components. To ﬁnd these we will ﬁnd
it convenient to reduce Sαβγδ into its irreducible parts.
This will be done in the spinor formalism of SL(2,C).

B. Spinor representation of spectral density

Spinors arise in the representation theory of the group
SL(2,C). For a short review of the theory of spinors, see
Appendix A, or a general reference such as [1]. According
to Eq. (A7) we ﬁnd the spinor equivalent of the covariant
spectral density tensor to be given by

SAB′CD′EF ′GH′ = σα

AB′ σβ

CD′ σγ

EF ′ σδ

GH′ Sαβγδ

(8)

SAB′CD′EF ′GH′ = −SCD′AB′EF ′GH′ = −SAB′CD′GH′EF ′.
(9a)
Since Sαβγδ is complex, the spectral density spinor is not
hermitian in its indicies. To ﬁnd how SAB′CD′EF ′GH′
transforms under complex conjugation we consider
Eq. (8) and Eqs. (7) with the result

SAB′CD′EF ′GH′ = SHG′F E′DC ′BA′ = SH′GF ′ED′CB′A.
(9b)
To ﬁnd the decomposition of the spectral density
spinor we make the observation that the equivalent spec-
tral density tensor satisﬁes some of the same symmetries,
Eq. (7a), as the Riemann tensor. We therefore let [1, 2]
inspire us in the decomposition and make use of the iden-
tities Eqs. (A11,A12). Writing the spectral density spinor
in a symmetric form

SAB′CD′EF ′GH′ = 1
+ 1

2 (SAB′CD′EF ′GH′ − SCB′AD′EF ′GH′ )

2 (SCB′AD′EF ′GH′ − SCD′AB′EF ′GH′ )

From Eq. (9a) and Eqs. (13-15) it follows that the sym-
metries of the decomposed spinors are

ΓB′D′EG = ΓD′B′EG = ΓB′D′GE

(16)

i.e ∆ = ∆†, Γ = Γ†. Therefore the spinor ∆ACF ′H′ has
three real components ∆11, ∆22, ∆33 and three complex
components ∆12, ∆13, ∆23, in total nine real independent
components. The same applies to the ΓB′D′EG spinor. In
total we ﬁnd 18+9+9 = 36 real independent components
describing the wave electromagnetic ﬁeld in the spinor
formulation, in accordance with the discussion following
Eq. (7).

∆ACF ′H′ = ∆CAF ′H′ = ∆ACH′F ′

ilar to Eq. (19). Instead they transform under complex

εAC (ΣF ′H′B′D′ εEG + ΓB′D′EG εF ′H′ )+
(∆ACF ′H′ εEG + ΣACEG εF ′H′ )εB′D′ .

(22)

C. Number of independent parameters

From Eq. (22) we may ﬁnd the number of independent
parameters needed to fully describe an electromagnetic
wave ﬁeld. Introducing the notation (1, 2, 3) = (00, 01 =
10, 11) we can write the components of the ΣACEG-spinor
as Σ0000 = Σ11, Σ1000 = Σ0100 = Σ21, Σ1100 = Σ31, and
similarily for the other components. From the symme-
tries in Eq. (18) we can then view the components of
ΣACEG as a matrix Σ with nine independent complex
components

The trace S of the contracted spinor SAB′CD′

which is traceless by construction and hence irreducible.
From its deﬁnition we ﬁnd the relations

MAB′CD′ = −ΓB′D′AC − ∆ACB′D′

MAB′CD′ = MCD′AB′

MAB′CD′ = MBA′DC ′.

or equivalently 18 real independent components. The
∆ACF ′H′ and ΓB′D′EG spinors in addition to Eq. (16)
and Eq. (17) also satisﬁes Eq. (21) and Eq. (20). Hence
the corresponding matricies behaves like hermitian 3 × 3
matrices ∆ij = ∆ji, Γij = Γji where (i, j) ∈ (1, 2, 3),

(23)

Calculating the trace of the terms involving the Γ and ∆

(εGAεF ′D′ΓH′B′EC

against the third and forth pair of indicies with the result

It remains to ﬁnd the irreducible parts of the Σ spinors
in Eq. (22). To this end we write Σ in a form utilizing
the symmetries expressed in Eq. (18)

bra. Equation (42) is comprised only of scalars or trace-
less spinors and hence is the sought irreducible represen-
tation of the spectral density spinor. Counting compo-
nents we ﬁnd that Eq. (43) has 5 plus 3 complex com-
ponents from Ψ and ξ respectively, which follows from
the symmetries. From the discussion in section (II C) we
know that the Γ and ∆ spinors has 9 real components
each which implies that M and D have 18 real compo-
nents in total. Together with the complex invariant λ it
adds up to 36 independent real components, in agreement
with the above discussion.

E. Relation to the Riemann tensor

We may note that if the covariant spectral density
tensor was real and satisﬁed Sαβγδ = Sγδαβ instead of
Eq. (7b) it would satisfy the same symmetries as the
Riemann tensor, Sαβγδ = Rαβγδ.
Indeed in such a
case DAB′CD′ = 0, ξAB′CD′ = 0, ΓAB′CD′ = ∆CD′AB′
so that MAB′CD′ = 2∆AB′CD′ would be the traceless
Ricci spinor, CAB′CD′EF ′GH′ = ΨACEGεF ′H′ εB′D′ +
ΨF ′H′B′D′εAC εEG the traceless Weyl spinor and λ =
λ∗ = R would be the Ricci scalar curvature. Hence
Eq. (42) would be completely analogous to the irreducible
spinor representation of the Riemann curvature tensor.

following scheme:

It is interesting to transform Eq. (42) to its tensor form.
Using the relation between a spinor and its equivalent
tensor, given by Eq. (A9), we can write this decomposi-
tion of the covariant spectral density tensor into its irre-
ducible components symbolically as

Sαβγδ = Cαβγδ ⊕ Mαβ ⊕ Dαβ ⊕ λ

(45)

In connection to this it is worthwhile noting that the
complex scalar invariant λ, the only quantity of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld diﬀerent observers agree on, satisﬁes

Re λ =

where ∗F µν is the dual tensor

Hence, we recover the two scalar invariants of electromag-
netic ﬁeld theory as the real and imaginary parts of the
complex scalar invariant of the covariant spectral density
tensor.

1. Form the spectral density tensor Eq. (6).

2. Calculate the spectral density spinor Eq. (8) using

Eq. (51).

3. Calculate Γ, Σ, ∆ using Eq. (13-15).

4. Calculate the irreducible spinor components λ from
Eq. (25), MAB′CD′ from Eq. (30), DAB′CD′ from
Eq. (35), Ψ from Eq. (37) and ξ using Eq. (40).

5. Transform the spinors obtained to their irreducible
tensor counterparts using Eq. (A9) and the spino-
rally contravariant form of Eq. (51).

A. Fundamental objects as irreducible components

By following the above scheme we ﬁnd the SL(2,C)
irreducible tensor components that comprise the spectral
density tensor according to Eq. (45). The ﬁrst tensor, the
complex scalar invariant λ is found to be

λ =

1
2

|E|2 − |H|2 + iℜ (E · H∗)
(cid:3)
(cid:2)

(52)

We identify the real and imaginary part as the scalar La-
grangian invariant and the pseudo scalar invariant (here
expressed in complex form since the ﬁelds are Fourier

transformed). As is well known, these are the only two
invariants that exist in Maxwells theory. This is veri-
ﬁed here by the fact that only scalars are true invariants
under a general spin frame transformation.

We immediately recognize Eq. (53) as the energy-
momentum-stress tensor in Maxwells theory, here ob-
tained as one of the irreducible components of the spec-
tral density tensor under SL(2,C). We identify as usual
σ as the energy density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld,
(Px, Py, Pz) = 1
2 ℜ(E × H∗) as the complex Poynting
vector and Tij as the three-dimensional Maxwell stress
tensor.

Turning our attention to the second rank two irre-

ducible tensor Dαβ we ﬁnd analogously

Qx Uxx Uxy Uxz
Qy Uyx Uyy Uyz
Qz Uzx Uzy Uzz



Dαβ = 

Q = −

(61)

Uij = −ℑ [E∗i Hj − H ∗i Ej] + δijK.

(62)

We identify Dαβ as a pseudotensor, with the D00 com-
ponent being the imaginary part of the pseudoscalar

6

(63)

(64)

invariant of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Since also e.g
Qx = −ℑ(EzE∗y + HzH ∗y ) we note that all components of
the pseudotensor Dαβ can be written as imaginary parts.
In analogy with σ, the energy density Eq. (54), we may
denote Eq. (60) the spin density of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. This is because Q, Eq. (61), is only diﬀerent from
zero in the case when the electromagnetic ﬁeld is ellip-
tically (i.e not linearly) polarized. We call Q the “spin
ﬂux density”.

Finally we calculate the components of the remaining
rank four tensor Cαβγδ, which in addition to satisfying
the same symmetries as the spectral density tensor

Cαβγδ = −Cβαγδ = −Cαβδγ

is also traceless

Cαβ

αβ = 0

when contracted over all indices. We leave the interpreta-
tion of this complex tensor to a future study, and choose
only to display the independent components in Appendix
B.

B. Physical interpretation

Interestingly, as we noted above, the real part of the
scalar invariant Eq. (52) of the electromagnetic ﬁeld
would play the role of the Ricci scalar curvature in
the case of real valued ﬁelds. Similarily the energy-
momentum-stress tensor Mαβ would play the role of the
Ricci tensor, while the rank four tensor Cαβγδ would be
analogous to the Weyl conformal tensor. While we could
proceed with the analogy of curvature of spacetime to
the “curvature” of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, we will not
pursue this topic further in the present paper.

The fact that the two possible true invariants of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld are found as the real and imaginary
parts of the complex scalar invariant is natural, since all
inertial observers should agree upon their measured val-
ues. That the energy-momentum-stress tensor is found
to be an irreducible component under SL(2,C) is encour-
aging and stress its importance in Maxwells theory.

More surprising is the (pseudo)tensor Dαβ found as
the second irreducible rank two component. We sug-
gest that this rank two pseudotensor with nine indepen-
dent components are the “zilch” and the “zilch-stress” of
the electromagnetic ﬁeld, as denoted by Lipkin [3], and
later generalized by Kibble [4]. The zilch is a conserved
quantity of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, just as the usual
energy-momentum-stress density is conserved, with fea-
tures resembling intrinsic spin as mentioned above. To
the authors knowledge, this rank two tensor has not been
written down explicitly in this form before[5]. We stress
that this tensor is obtained on equal footing and occur as
naturally as the energy-momentum stress tensor in our
analysis. The components of Dαβ are real valued and the
tensor represent observables, with a clear physical mean-
ing of classical spin. The new rank four tensor Cαβγδ is

The correspondence between tensors and spinors are
established by the Infeld van der Waerden symbols, a set
of four 2x2 hermitian matrices σµ
AB′ (xν ), which are func-
tions of space-time. These objects transform as a tensor
in greek indicies, and as a spinor in Roman indicies. They
satisfy the relation

tensor of Riemannian space and the Levi-Cevita symbols,

The Levi-Cevita symbols play the spinor role analog to
the metric tensors. The operation of raising and lowering
spinor indicies are accomplished by

One can easily check that the spinor of the metric tensor
satisﬁes

The relation between a tensor Tµν and the corrspond-

ing spinor is given by

TAB′CD′ = σµ

and analogously for tensors with more indicies.
If the
tensor is real valued, the spinor equivalent is hermitian,
e.g the real valued vector Aµ have a equivalent hermitian
spinor

AAB′ = ABA′ = AB′A.

(A8)

If the tensor is complex the hermicity condition of the
spinor does not hold. This is the case for most spinors en-
countered in this article. Finally, given a spinor TAB′CD′
its tensor equivalent Tµν is given by

We have considered all possible bilinear forms of the
electromagnetic Fourier transformed ﬁeld for an arbi-
trary metric in Riemannian spacetime. The constructed
spectral density tensor was decomposed into irreducible
components by considering the covariant spectral den-
sity spinor in the complex tangent space introduced un-
der the group SL(2,C). The spectral density was found to
be comprised of the following irreducible components: a
complex scalar invariant corresponding to the two known
invariants of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, the rank two
energy-momentum-stress tensor, another new rank two
(pseudo)tensor expressing the spin (polarization) prop-
erties of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and a new rank four
tensor. While the ﬁrst two tensors (scalar and stress-
tensor) are well known important objects in Maxwells
theory, the new rank two and rank four tensors are very
little or not at all previously studied. Since they are ir-
reducible components under the group transformations
we propose that they also are conserved quantities of the
electromagnetic ﬁeld. Considering how they arise as nat-
urally and inevitably as the ususal energy-momentum-
stress tensor, they certainly deserve further study. We
leave the detailed study of the discovered components
and their conservation laws to a future investigation.

spinors could be a possible way to accomplish it.

APPENDIX A: SPINOR REPRESENTATION OF
THE GROUP SL(2,C) IN CURVED SPACETIME

In this appendix we review the theory of spinors and
how they are applied to general relativity and this article.
In a Riemannian space one can to each point in space-
time introduce a complex two-dimensional tangent space.
For every tensor in Riemannian space there is then a cor-
responding complex spinor in the tangent spinor space.
For every tensor index labeled with greek letters running
over 0, 1, 2, 3 there are then two spinor indices labeled
with Roman capital letters running over 0, 1. Primed
spinor indicies belong to the complex conjugate spinor
space and and runs over 0′, 1′. Spinors originate from
the representation theory of the group SL(2,C). We use
a matrix representation in which a typical element g of

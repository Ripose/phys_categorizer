Transformation rules for coordinates, velocities and accelerations in accelerated
reference frames are derived. Generalized approach of the special relativity is taken
for a basis. A 7-dimensional space including projections of a velocity vector as
three additional coordinates to time and geometric coordinates is studied. Turns in
pseudoplane (dt, dv) of this 7-space describe accelerated motion of frame. In addition
to the velocity of light c, the transformation formulas contain a fundamental constant
A which has a meaning of maximal acceleration. It is demonstrated that if a source of
light moves with acceleration with respect to some reference frame, the velocity of light
is smaller than c and depends on the acceleration in this frame. The special relativity
relation between energy, impulse, and mass gets changed for a particle in accelerated
motion. A generalized wave operator being invariant to the above transformations is
introduced. The components of electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor and electromagnetic ﬁeld
potential get mixed in transformation relations for an accelerated frame.

At the moment the relativistic approach reducing to Rindler transformations (see, e.g.,
[1, 2]) is widely used for the analysis of phenomena in accelerated reference frames.
However the deﬁnition of acceleration is in contradiction with invariance of derivation
rules with respect to derivative degree in the speciﬁed approach. Really, a ﬁrst derivative
v = dx/dt, a second derivative a = dv/dt, and,
in a common case, a derivative
of any degree must be deﬁned by uniform derivation rules. The additional algebraic
relation between velocity v and turn angle ψ in a pseudoplane (x, t) is introduced in
the special relativity. In particular, this relation allows to receive the relativistic rule of
composition of velocities. Yet when acceleration is deﬁned a similar algebraic relation
is not considered. For this reason generalized relativistic relations for acceleration can
escape our understanding and the rule of composition of accelerations being similar to
the special relativity rule of composition of velocities can not be formulated.

Caianiello [3] in the context of a quantization model formulated in an eight-dimensional
geometric phase space, with coordinates xα =

four-vectors, and ui = dxi/ds is relativistic four-velocity (i = 1, . . . , 4).

The objective of this work is to ﬁnd the special relativity generalization to

accelerated motions through derivation rules for acceleration as well as for velocity.

2. Formulation of problem

We shall consider a body B in linear motion with respect to a frame K with velocity v
and acceleration a. Let a frame K ′ moves linear with respect to K with velocity v and
acceleration a. Let the motion of body B is characterized by velocity v′ and acceleration
a′ with respect to K ′. In Figure 1 frames explaining the considered situation are shown.
In the Newtonian mechanics, the kinematics of a linear uniform accelerated motion

is described by the system of diﬀerential equations

′
dt = dt
,
dx = v dt′ + dx′ ,
dv = a dt′ + dv′ ,
da = da′ = 0 .

The desired generalization of the special relativity must meet to the speciﬁed

A uniform mathematical approach for the necessary generalizations is proposed
including rules of composition of
in Section 3. An accelerated motion kinematics,
velocities and accelerations and transformations of kinematic variables, is considered
in Section 4. In particular, the reduction to Rindler transformations is produced. A
generalization of dynamic variables (energy, impulse, force) is produced in Section 5
where wave equation is also modiﬁed to describe accelerated motion of a wave. Section 6
contains transformations of electromagnetic ﬁeld potential and tensor for an accelerated
frame. The conclusions are presented in Section 7.

3. Transformations in the special relativity

In this section the special relativity relations [4] will be derived, the applied approach
being important for further analysis.

A square of linear element being used in the special relativity can be represented

as

(ds)2 = c2 (dt)2

(dx)2 .

The variables is changed conveniently by:

dx1 = dx ,

dx4 = c dt .

Using the new variables we have the square of linear element in form

The linear transformation preserving the square of linear element

is turn in (dx1, dx4) pseudoeuclidean plane [5]. The transformation matrix is

and

dx1 = sinh Ψ (dx4)′ + cosh Ψ (dx1)′ ,

where Ψ is turn angle.

To ﬁnd a relation between the angle Ψ and the velocity v = dx/dt we shall consider

the variation of coordinate diﬀerentials

These relations describe Lorentz transformations and the special relativity rule for

The principal articles of the mathematical approach used above must be

emphasized:

considered.

v = dx/dt.

(i) The vector space is built on the diﬀerentials of x(t) function and argument t.

(ii) The linear transformations preserving the square of linear element of this space are

(iii) A correspondence exists between the said linear transformations and the derivative

(iv) The rule of composition of the linear transformations corresponds to the
composition rule in the space of derivatives (i.e. the velocity composition rule).

We shall assume that this approach has invariant meaning and can be applied to the
function v(t). This point of view allows to obtain transformation rules for an accelerated
frame and the rule of composition of accelerations in according with the special relativity
principles.

4. Transformations for accelerated frames

In addition to the function x(t) we shall consider the function v(t) = dx/dt.
Correspondingly to the previous section consideration we shall construct a vector space
on the diﬀerentials dx, dt, dv and set the square of linear element in the following form

(ds)2 = c2 (dt)2

(dx)2

T 2 (dv)2 .

−

−

Here the constant T adjusts the dimensionality of dv to the dimensionality of linear
element and has the dimensionality of time. Setting the constant

L = c T

with the dimensionality of length and dividing the square of linear element by L2 we
obtain

In this expression all components are dimensionless. Let us change variables

(7)

Further we shall make considerations about a sign of velocity diﬀerential square
in the square of linear element. One can deﬁne dimensionless square of linear element
through covariant and conrtavariant vector coordinates as

(dσ)2 = dx4 dx4 + dx1 dx1 + dx1

4 dx4

Here all addends on the right have a positive sign. We shall use by relations

dx1 = g11 dx1 = dx1 ,

dx4 = g44 dx4 =

where it is discounted that metric tensor components

g11 = 1 ,

g44 = g44 =

−

and the turn matrix in pseudoeuclidean plane does not change a sign by transposition.
In result we shall get (7). Thus coordinate x1

4 is spacelike.

Let us introduce the following notations for dimensionless motion parameters: x1,
4, x1
44 as coordinate, time, velocity and acceleration of the body B with respect to
44)′ as identical quantities with respect to the frame
44 are coordinate, time, velocity and acceleration of the frame K ′

Since turns are in general non-commuting, a motion with U = V A must be

distinguished from a motion with U = A V.

If the parameters of motion (velocity and acceleration) of the frame K1 are measured
with respect to the frame K, we shall call the frame K1 being embedded in the frame K.
Let us introduce an ordering relation on the embedded frames given by the sequence
of determination of parameters of motion. Figures 2(a,b) show the embedded frames
describing V A- and A V-motion respectively.

4.1.1. Rule of composition of accelerations Because, for V A-motion the acceleration
a of the frame K ′ is determined with respect to the uniform velocity frame K1 (see
Figure 3), the rule of composition of accelerations in the frame K depends on the
velocity v of the embedded frame K1.

From (11) under initial condition (Ψ = 0, x1

n is integer, wave velocity for oscillatory motion is equal

(see, e.g., [7]).

8. Conclusions

The present work considers accelerated motions in the context which diﬀers radically
from Caianiello’s conception (see [8] and references therein). However our results are
similar to those obtained in works of Caianiello and his colleagues [6, 9]. We assume that
acceleration has to be considered as well as velocity in the special relativity. Namely, as
turn angle in pseudoplane (dx, dt) corresponds to velocity as turn angle in pseudoplane
(dv, dt) must correspond to acceleration. Because of this, the dimension of space-time
should be increased through three coordinates of velocity instead of coordinates of four-
velocity used in Caianiello’s model. In turn it explains diﬀerence between coordinate
transformations, and between relations for kinematic and dynamic parameters in our
and Scarpetta’s considerations [6].

The generalization of special relativity transformations to accelerated reference
frames requires a new fundamental constant T of time dimensionality to be introduced.
fundamental length L = c T , and
This constant breeds a set of secondary constants:
fundamental acceleration A = c/T . Within the framework of this paper the problem on
quantitative values of these constants is not discussed.

Note that the introduced 7-space is pseudoeuclidean and the above considered

transformations for accelerated frames preserve its metric.

Since in according to the special relativity, three velocity components and three
space turn angles make full Lorentz group, the present work supposes natural
generalization to uniform rotations of reference frames.

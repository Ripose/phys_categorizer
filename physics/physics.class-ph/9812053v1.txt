Superluminal Signal Velocity

Abstract

It recently has been demonstrated that signals conveyed by evanescent modes can travel faster

than light.

In this report some special features of signals are introduced and investigated, for

instance the fundamental property that signals are frequency band limited.

Evanescent modes are characterized by extraordinary properties: Their energy is negative, they

are not directly measurable, and the evanescent region is not causal since the modes traverse this

region instantaneously. The study demonstrates the necessity of quantum mechanical principles

in order to interprete the superluminal signal velocity of classical evanescent modes.

Introduction

Tunneling represents the wave mechanical analogy to the propagation of evanescent modes [1]. Evanes-

cent modes are observed, e.g. in the case of total reﬂection, in undersized waveguides, and in periodic

dielectric heterostructures [2]. Compared with the wave solutions an evanescent mode is characterized

by a purely imaginary wave number, so that i.e. the wave equation yields for the electric ﬁeld E(x)

E(x) = ei(ωt−kx) ⇒ E(x) = eiωt−κx,

(1)

where ω is the angular frequency, t the time, x the distance, k the wave number, and κ = ik the

imaginary wave number of the evanescent mode.

Thus evanescent modes are characterized by an exponential attenuation and a lack of phase shift.

The latter means that the mode has not spent time in the evanescent region, which in turn results in

an inﬁnite velocity in the phase time approximation neglecting the phase shift at the boundary [3].

Two examples of electromagnetic structures in which evanescent modes exist are shown in Fig.1 [2].

The dispersion relations of the respective transmission coeﬃcients are displayed in the same ﬁgure.

In (c) the

heterostructure displays a forbidden gap which corresponds to a tunneling regime, for details see

Ref.[2]. The evanescent regime is characterized by a strong attenuation due to the exponential decay.

2 Signals

Quite often a signal is said to be deﬁned by switching on or oﬀ light. It is assumed that the front

of the light beam informs my neighbour of my arrival home with the speed of light. Such a signal is

sketched in Fig.2. The inevitable inertia of the light source causes an inclination of the signal’s front

and tail. Due to the detector’s sensitivity, level DS, the information about the neighbours arrival

(switching on) and departure (switching oﬀ) becomes dependent on intensity. In this example the

departure time is detected earlier with the attenuated weak signal.

This special signal does not transmit reliable information on arrival and departure time. In addition

to the dependence on intensity , a light front may be generated by any spontaneous emission process or

accidentally by another neighbour. Obviously, a detector needs more than a signal’s front to response

properly. The detector needs information about carrier frequency and modulation of the signal in

order to obtain reliable information about the cause.

In general, a signal is detected some time after the arrival of the light’s front. Due to the dynamics

of detecting systems there are several signal oscillations needed in order to produce an eﬀect [1]. An

light beam are F1, F2 and the tails are T1, T2. They are measured at diﬀerent places and times in

consequence of the detector’s responsitivity level Ds.

eﬀect is detected with the energy velocity. In vacuum or in a medium with normal dispersion the

signal velocity equals both, the energy and the group velocities.

For example, a classical signal can be transmitted by the Morse alphabet, in which each letter

corresponds to a certain number of dots and dashes. In general signals are either frequency (FM)

or amplitude modulated (AM) and they have in common that the signal does not depend on its

magnitude. A modern signal transmission, where the halfwidth corresponds to the number of digits,

is displayed in Fig.3. This AM signal has an infra-red carrier with 1.5µm wave length and is glass ﬁber

guided from transmitter to receiver. As mentioned above, the signals are independent of magnitude

as the halfwidth does not depend on the signal’s magnitude.

The front or very beginning of a signal is only well deﬁned in the theoretical case of an inﬁnite

frequency spectrum. However, physical generators only produce signals of ﬁnite spectra. This is due

to their inherent inertia and due to a signal’s ﬁnite energy content. These properties result in a real

front which is deﬁned by the measurable beginning of the signal. For example the signals of Fig.3
have a detectable frequency band width of ∆ν = ±10−4 · νC , where νC is the carrier frequency.

Frequency band limitation in consequence of a ﬁnite signal energy reveals one of the fundamental

deﬁciencies of classical physics. A classical detector can detect a deliberately small amount of energy,

whereas every physical detector needs at least one quantum of the energy ¯h ω in order to respond.

Figure 3: An example of a modern AM signal used in optoelectronics. The halfwidth of the pulse-like

signal represents the number of digits, i.e. to the transmitted information. The carrier wave frequency

is 2 1014 Hz and the amplitude modulation is limited to a frequency band width of about 1010 Hz.

3 An Experimental Result

Superluminal signal velocities have been measured by Enders and Nimtz [4, 5, 6]. The experiments

were carried out with AM microwaves in undersized waveguides and in periodic dielectric heterostruc-

tures. The measured propagation time of a pulse is shown in Fig.4. The microwave pulse has travelled

either through air or it has crossed an evanescent barrier [6]. The linewidth of the pulse represents the

signal. The experimental result is, that the tunneled signal has passed the airborne signal at a super-

luminal velocity of 4.7 · c. The measurements of the traversal time are carried out under vacuum-like

conditions at the exit of the evanecscent region, the reason for this will be discussed later.

4 Some Implications of superluminal signal velocity

Measured microwave signals are shown in Fig.4. The halfwidth (information) of the tunneled signal

has traversed the evanescent region at a velocity of 4.7 · c. As explained above, signals have a limited

frequency spectrum since their energy content W is always ﬁnite and detectable frequency components

with ω ≥ W/¯h can not exist.

In this experiment all frequency components of the signal are evanescent and move at a velocity

faster than c. The beginning of the evanescent signal overtakes that of the airborne signal as seen

in Fig.4. The superluminal velocity of evanescent modes has some interesting features diﬀering fun-

damentally from luminal or subluminal propagation of waves with real wave numbers. This will be

discussed in the following subsections.

4.1 Change of chronological order

The existence of a superluminal signal velocity ensures the posssibility of an interchange of chronolog-

ical order. Let us assume an inertial system ΣII moves away from system ΣI with a velocity vr. The

Time [ns]

Figure 4: Measured barrier traversal time of a microwave packet through a multilayer structure inside

a waveguide (barrier length 114.2 mm). The center frequency has been 8.7 GHz with a frequency

width of ± 0.5 GHz. The pulse’s magnitudes are normalized. The slow pulse (1) traversed the empty

waveguide, whereas the fast one (2) has tunneled the forbidden gap of the same length The maximum

corresponds to the center of mass and equals the group velocity. The group velocity of the tunneled

signal was 4.7 · c [6]. The transmission dispersion of the barrier is shown in Fig.1(c) curve b). The

tunneled signal (i.e. the halfwidth of the pulse) traversed the 114.2 mm long barrier in 81 ps, whereas

the signal spent 380 ps to cross the same air distance. The time resolution in the experiment has been

better than ± 1 ps [4, 6].

Special Relativity (SR) gives the following relationship for the travelling time ∆t and for the distance

∆x of a signal in the system ΣI which is watched in ΣII

∆tII =

∆I − vr∆xI /c2

r /c2)1/2 =

∆tI (1 − vSvr/c2)

.

vr ≥ c2/vS is the condition for the change of chronological order, i.e. ∆tII ≤ 0, between the

systems ΣI and ΣII . For example, at a signal velocity vS ≥ 10 c the chronological order changes at

vr ≤ 0.1 c. This result does not violate the SR. The common constraint vS≤ c is posed by the SR on

electromagnetic wave propagation in a dispersive medium and not on the propagation of evanescent

modes.

4.2 Negative electromagnetic energy

The Schr¨odinger equation yields a negative kinetic energy in the tunneling case, where the potential

U is larger than the particle’s total energy W:

The same happens to evanescent modes. Within the mathematical analogy their kinetic electro-

magnetic energy is negative too. The Helmholtz equation for the electric ﬁeld E in a waveguide is

given by the relationship

d2Ψ
d2x

+

2m
¯h2 (W − U )Ψ = 0

d2E
d2x

+ (k2 − k2

c )E = 0

where kc is the cut-oﬀ wave number of the evanescent regime. The quantity (k2 - k2

c ) plays a role

analogous to the energy eigenvalue and is negative in the case of evanescent modes.

The dielectric function ǫ of evanescent modes is negative and thus the refractive index is imaginary.

For the basic mode a rectangular waveguide has the following dispersion of its dielectric function,

where kc = (π/b)2 holds and b is the waveguide width,

λ0 is the free space wavelength of the electromagnetic wave.

In the case of tunneling it is argued that a particle can only be measured in the barrier with a

photon having an energy ¯hω ≥ (U - W) [7]. This means that the total energy of the system is positive.

According to Eq.(5) the evanescent mode’s electric energy density ρ is given by the relationship

ǫ(λ0) = (1 − λ0/2b)

where ǫ0 is the electric permeability.

The analogy between the Schr¨odinger equation and the Helmholtz equation holds again and it is

not possible to measure an evansecent mode. Achim Enders and I tried hard to measure evanescent

modes with probes put into the evanescent region but failed [8]. Obviously evanescent modes are not

directly measurable in analogy to a particle in a tunnel. We might also say this problem is due to

impedance mismatch between the evanescent mode and a probe. The impedance Z of the basic mode

in a rectangular waveguide is given by the relationship

Z = Z0 ǫ

−1/2

where Z0 is the free space impedance. In the evanesecent regime k < kc the impedance is imaginary.

4.3 The not-causal evanescent region

Evanescent modes do not experience a phase shift inside the evanescent region [2, 3]. They cross this

region without consuming time. The predicted [3] and the measured [2] time delay happens at the

boundary between the wave and the evanescent mode regime. For opaque barriers (i.e. κ · x ≥ 1,where

κ is the imaginary wave number and x the length of the evanescent barrier) the phase shift becomes

constant with ≈ 2π which corresponds to one oscillation time of the mode. In fact, the measured

barrier traversal time was roughly equal to the reciprocal frequency in the microwave as well as in

the optical experiments, i.e. either in the 100 ps or in the 2 fs time range independent of the barrier

length [2]. The latter behaviour is called Hartman eﬀect: the tunneling time is independent of barrier

length and has indeed been measured with microwave pulses thirty years after its prediction [5].

5 Summing up

Evanescent modes show some amazing properties with which we are not familiar. For instance the

evansecent region is not causal since evanescent modes do not spend time there. This is an experi-

mental result due to the fact that the traversal time is independent of barrier length.

Another strange experience in classical physics is that evanescent ﬁelds cannot be measured. This

is due to their negative energy or to the impedance mismatch. Amazingly enough this is in analogy

with the wave mechanical tunneling.

The energy of signals is always ﬁnite resulting in a limited frequency spectrum both according to

Planck’s energy quantum ¯hω. This is a fundamental deﬁciency of classical physics, which assumes the

7

measurability of any small amount of energy. A physical signal never has an ideal front. the latter

needs inﬁnite high frequency components with a correspondingly high energy.

Another consequence of the frequency band limitation of signals is, if they have only evanescent

mode components, they are not Lorentz-invariant. The signal may travel faster than light.

Front, group, signal, and energy velocities all have the same value in vacuum. Bearing in mind

the narrow frequency band of signals, the former statement holds also for the velocities of evanescent

modes. In ﬁrst order approximation the dispersion relation of a stop band is constant and a signiﬁcant

pulse reshaping does not take place. This result demonstrate that signals and eﬀects may transmitted

with superluminal velocities provided that they are carried by evanescent modes.

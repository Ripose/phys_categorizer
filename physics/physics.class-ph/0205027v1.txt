Abstract

Several issues relating to oppositely directed phase velocity and power ﬂow are
reviewed. A necessary condition for the occurrence of this phenomenon in isotropic
dielectric–magnetic mediums is presented. Ramiﬁcations for aberration–free lenses,
homogenization approaches, and complex mediums are discussed.

Keywords: Left–handed materials, Negative phase velocity, Negative real permeabil-
ity, Negative real permittivity

Introduction

As witnessed by the introduction of a session on the so–called left–handed materials in this
conference, materials with negative phase velocity have attracted much attention during
the last two years. Over three decades ago, Veselago [1] suggested many unusual properties
of materials with negative real relative permittivity and negative real relative permeability
at a certain frequency, including inverse refraction, negative radiation pressure, inverse
Doppler eﬀect. However, his considerations were completely speculative in view of the lack
of a material, or even a nonhomogeneous composite medium, with a relative permittivity
having a negative real part and a very small imaginary part. A breakthrough was achieved
by Smith et al. [2], who, developing some earlier ideas by Pendry et al. [3]–[5], presented
evidence for a weakly dissipative composite medium displaying negative values for the
real parts of its eﬀective permittivity and eﬀective permeability. Their so–called meta–
material consists of various inclusions of conducting rings and wires embedded within

printed circuit boards. Other types of nanostructural combinations with similar response
properties can also be devised [6].

Experimental results published last year by Shelby et al. [7] on the transmission of a
10–GHz beam through a wedge provided impetus to the electromagnetics community
∼
for a discussion on the concept of a negative index of refraction. Doubts have emerged
on the homogeneity and the isotropy of the composite materials used by Shelby et al. as
well as on the adequacy of their measurement setup [8]–[10]. Despite those doubts, the
crucial ﬂipping of the transmission pattern about the normal to the exit surface, when
a teﬂon wedge was replaced by a wedge made of the ring–wire material, appears to be
unexplainable in any way other than by resorting to the essence of Veselago’s suggestion.
In view of the considerable literature accumulated during the past few months and the
explosive nature of the current scientiﬁc scene [11], we take this opportunity to present
our thoughts on a variety of related issues.

2 What’s in a name?

The emergence of a clear terminology is often a diﬃcult process with regards to scientiﬁc
ﬁndings relating to novel eﬀects, something that is also apparent in the present instance.
The ﬁrst label for the candidate materials is left–handed materials [1]. But chiral materials
are important subjects of electromagnetics research and the terms left–handedness and
right–handedness have been applied to the molecular structure of such materials for well
over a century [12]. The continued use of the term left–handed materials (LHMs) for
achiral materials will thus confuse the crucial issues [2, 7, 13, 14].

The term backward (BW) medium has been proﬀered by Lindell and colleagues [15].
This term presumes the a priori deﬁnitions of forward and backward directions. Whatever
be the merits of this term for planewave propagation, it would founder for problems
involving nonplanar interfaces.

Ziolkowski and Heyman [16] recently provided the most extensive theoretical and nu-
merical analysis of the negative index of refraction to date. They introduced the technical
term double negative (DNG) medium to indicate that the real parts of both permittivity
and permeability are negative. While sensible enough, such nomenclature conceals the
importance of dissipative eﬀects.

After a careful study of the relevant constitutive parameters, we have come to the
conclusion that the term negative phase–velocity (NPV) medium is unambiguous and
covers all possible situations that we could think of. It also provides a contrast to the
emerging negative group–velocity (NGV) mediums, reports on which are now emerging
with regularity [17]–[20].

cient, but not necessary, requirement for the phase velocity to be negative. This result
has been illustrated by frequency–domain [21] as well as time–domain [22] calculations
of planewave reﬂection at the planar interface of free space and a NPV medium with
Lorentzian characteristics.

r < 0 and µ′

A plane electromagnetic wave polarized parallel to the x axis, and propagating along

the z axis in a medium characterized by ǫr and µr, is described by

E(z) = A exp(ik0n±z) ux ,

z) axis; accordingly, Re [n+] < 0 (resp. Re [n−] > 0), where
ﬂow along the +z (resp.
z (resp.
Re [ • ] denotes the real part. Thus, the phase velocity is oriented parallel to the
+z) axis. Some confusion in the literature [23] emerges from the claimed inadmissability
of either n+ or n− on grounds other than the dictates of power ﬂow.

4 Perfect lenses

Pendry [23] presented the possibility of fabricating a perfect (i.e., aberration–free) lens
from a material with ǫr = µr =
1, which attracted enormous attention from such lu-
minaries as science reporters attached to various newspapers. Attention came from re-
searchers as well [9, 16], [24]–[27]. In particular, Ziolkowski and Heyman [16] concluded
from extensive two–dimensional simulations that the condition ǫr = µr =
1 cannot be
met by realistic meta–materials, even in some narrow frequency range.

Aberrations due to dissipation inside the desired NPV medium (with ǫr = µr =
1)
would prove to be a stumbling block in fabricating the desired perfect lenses [26, 27].
However, the possible use of active (i.e., non–passive) elements in meta–materials may
provide some relief from the glorious tyranny of the principle of conservation of energy
[28]. Chromatic aberrations due to non–fulﬁlment of the required conditions outside some
narrow frequency range will also be important [9, 26].

5 Distributed Bragg reﬂectors

The Bragg regime of a multilayer distributed Bragg reﬂector (DBR) would undergo a blue–
shift, if a conventional positive phase–velocity (PPV) constituent were to be replaced by its
NPV counterpart [29]. An underlying cause may be the reversal of phase of the reﬂected
and the transmitted plane waves, when a PPV medium is replaced by a NPV medium [30].
Anyhow, multilayer DBRs with NPV constituents could be useful in wavelength regimes
that are inaccessible with DBRs employing PPV constituents exclusively.

6 Homogenization

The meta–materials wherein the phase velocity can be directed opposite to the power
ﬂow are composite materials comprising inclusions of various kinds dispersed in some host
medium. At suﬃciently low frequencies, a homogeneous medium can be prescribed as
eﬀectively equivalent to a particulate composite medium for certain purposes [31]–W00¸ .

Incorporation of NPV mediums in such well–known homogenization approaches as the
ones named after Maxwell Garnett and Bruggeman [31] is mathematically trivial, and we
forecast many theoretical publications thereon. Whether or not the theoretical predictions
of those approaches will be physically realized is another matter. We do, however, note that
surprising results can emerge from the consideration of NPV mediums in homogenization
approaches. For instances [8],

(i) the Bruggeman approach forecasts that a certain mixture of a NPV medium with
its prosaic PPV counterpart, both impedance–matched, can function as the medium
that Pendry deems desirable for fabricating perfect lenses [23]; and

(ii) the Maxwell Garnett approach predicts that composite mediums with zero permittiv-
ity and zero permeability can be made as electrically small NPV inclusions dispersed
randomly but homogeneously in a PPV host medium.

7 Complex mediums

Oppositely directed phase velocity and power ﬂow are distinct possibilities in complex
mediums, as discussed by Lindell et al. [15], and could yield interesting phenomenons. As
an example, the circular Bragg phenomenon will be reversed in ferrocholesteric materials
with negative real permittivities and permeabilities [34]. Even in isotropic chiral mediums,
negative ǫ′

r will lead to a reversed circular dichroism [35].

r and µ′

To conclude, this brief overview of various emerging issues relating to NPV mediums
is expected to stimulate diﬀerent lines of thought among the participants of Complex

4

Mediums III . In view of claims and counter–claims launched respectively by Shelby et al.
[7] and the detractors of their experimental results, the scientiﬁc situation is very presently
volatile. Though the commonplace Lorentz model does allow the possibility of isotropic,
homogeneous, dielectric–magnetic materials exhibiting negative phase velocity [21], our
brief overview deﬁnitely does not contain the last word on the topic of artiﬁcial materials
acting similarly.

In our opinion, the invocation of ‘the “group Snell’s law” ’ by these authors has no
foundation in electromagnetic theory, and any consequences drawn from that ‘law’
are highly suspect. Notwithstanding that, their concern on the transmission measure-
ments having probably been not made by Shelby et al. [7] in the far zone does have
merit.

Abstract

This paper addresses the problem of the separation of rota-
tional and internal motion. It introduces the concept of average
angular velocity as the moment of inertia weighted average of
particle angular velocities. It extends and elucidates the concept
of Jellinek and Li (1989) of separation of the energy of overall
rotation in an arbitrary (non-linear) N-particle system. It gen-
eralizes the so called Koenig’s theorem on the two parts of the
kinetic energy (center of mass plus internal) to three parts: center
of mass, rotational, plus the remaining internal energy relative to
an optimally translating and rotating frame.

1 Introduction

The motion of a rigid body is completely characterized by its (center of mass)
translational velocity and its angular velocity which describes the rotational
motion. Rotational motion as a phenomenon is, however, not restricted to
rigid bodies and it is then a kinematic problem to deﬁne exactly what the
rotational motion of the system is. This paper introduces the new concept
of ‘average angular velocity’ as the solution this problem and discusses some
applications brieﬂy.

The average angular velocity concept is closely analogous to the concept
of center of mass velocity. For a system of particles the center of mass velocity
is simply the mass weighted average of the particle velocities. In a similar
way the average angular velocity is the moment of inertia weighted average
of the angular velocities of the particle position vectors.

The separation of rotational motion from the internal degrees of free-
dom of a system is of interest in a wide variety of applications. Among the
more obvious are vibration-rotation coupling in polyatomic molecules and
the understanding of biomechanical phenomena involving falling cats, ﬁgure
skaters, springboard divers etc. The basic theoretical work on the subject
is Carl Eckart’s (1935) whose work has been extended and elucidated by
many authors, for example Sayvetz (1939) and Ess´en (1979). Biomechanical
aspects have been discussed by Frohlich (1979) from a multibody dynamic
point of view, and by Ess´en (1981) from the Eckart point of view.

Considering the maturity of the subject one might think that all basic
theoretical results are quite old, but a letter on the subject was published
as late as 1989 by Jellinek and Li (1989). They showed that one can deﬁne
an angular velocity vector and separate out a rotational part of the energy,
for an arbitrary (nonlinear) system of particles, without the use of the rigid
reference conﬁguration that is needed in the Eckart construction.

In this paper I present some new developments based on ideas related
to those of Jellinek and Li. In particular I introduce the concept of average
angular velocity as the weighted average of particle angular velocities with
moments of inertia as weights. Especially for the elementary, but pedagogi-
cally important, case of ﬁxed axis rotation this leads to simple and concep-
tually powerful results. The relevance of these results to spinning athletes
and turning cats are brieﬂy indicated.

Later sections of the paper treat the three dimensional case. It is shown
that the separation of a rotational part of the kinetic energy can be done in

2

a way closely analogous to the well known split of the kinetic energy to an
overall center of mass translational part plus the kinetic energy of internal
motion relative to the center of mass system. A second split is thus done,
now to an overall rotational energy plus a remaining part corresponding to
motions in a rotating center of mass system, the rotation of which is given
by the average angular velocity.

Throughout this paper I consider a system of N particles with masses
mk and position vectors rk (k = 1, . . . , N). A distance from the Z-axis is
denoted by ρ, and a distance from the origin by r, the azimuthal angle is ϕ
and the angle to the positive Z-axis is θ.

2 Average Angular Velocity Around a Fixed

Axis

The z-component of the angular momentum, Lz, is by deﬁnition

Lz =

mk(rk × vk) · ez =

mk(xk ˙yk − yk ˙xk).

k=1

N

k=1

Here the Z-axis has a ﬁxed direction and is either ﬁxed in an inertial system
or ﬁxed in the center of mass of the system. We now introduce cylindrical
(polar) coordinates ρ, ϕ, and z. In terms of these we have for the position
vectors rk = ρk eρk + zk ez and for the velocities ˙rk = ˙ρk eρk + ρk ˙ϕk eϕk + ˙zk ez.
This gives us
(rk × vk) · ez = [(ρk eρk + zk ez) × ( ˙ρk eρk + ρk ˙ϕk eϕk + ˙zk ez)] · ez = ρ2

k ˙ϕk, (2)

so that

Lz(t) =

mkρ2

k(t) ˙ϕk(t).

k=1

If we now deﬁne the average angular velocity of the system, around the Z-
axis, by

ωav(t) ≡ h ˙ϕ(t)it = P

k=1 mkρ2

k(t) ˙ϕk(t)

and the (instantaneous) moment of inertia, with respect to the Z-axis, by

we see that we get

Lz = Jzωav.

˙ϕ, then, of course, ωav = ˙ϕ.
If all particles have the same angular velocity,
This happens, in particular, if the system of particles is rigid and rotates
around the Z-axis, but also more generally for any type of motion that obeys
˙ϕk = ˙ϕ with arbitrary ˙ρk and ˙zk. For these cases one gets the standard result
that Lz = Jz ˙ϕ.

We can now apply these results to the z-component of the angular mo-

mentum principle ( ˙L = M) in the form

The general result is that

˙Lz = Mz.

˙Jzωav + Jz ˙ωav = Mz.

(6)

(7)

(8)

If the angular velocity is well deﬁned we can replace ωav by ˙ϕ in this expres-
sion. If we furthermore assume that the body is rigid so that Jz = constant,
equation (8) reduces to the standard result Jz ¨ϕ = Mz.

If there is no external moment (or ‘torque’) with respect to the Z-axis,
so that Mz = 0, then the z-component of the angular momentum vector will
be conserved, Lz = constant, and, in view of equation (6), we ﬁnd that

Jz(t) ωav(t) = constant.

(9)

This then says that a large moment of inertia implies small average angular
velocity and vice versa. Here it is not assumed that there is rigidity or even
a deﬁnite angular velocity. It is this more general form of the standard text
book formula, Jz ˙ϕ = constant, that is actually ‘used’ by springboard divers
and ﬁgure skaters.

3 The Cat Landing on its Feet

For some arbitrary quantity γk the averaging of equation (4) can be written
k=1 mkρ2

N

(10)

hγ(t)it ≡ P

k(t) γk(t)
k(t)

N

k=1 mkρ2

.

P

A question of interest is to what extent the average angular velocity can be
understood as the time derivative of the ‘average angle’, hϕit, of the system.

4

The subscript t on the averaging bracket is meant as a reminder that the
weights in the averaging, mkρ2
k(t), are time dependent and this means that
the time derivative of an average will not be the same as the average of a
time derivative.

If we take the time derivative of

a simple calculation shows that

ϕav ≡ hϕit

ωav =

+ 2h

(ϕav − ϕ)it.

dϕav
dt

ρ

(11)

(12)

The average angular velocity is thus not simply the time derivative of the
average angle. This is, of course, essential if a cat, dropped upside-down, is
to be able to land on its feet. Equation (9) shows that if ωav = 0 initially,
it will remain zero in the absence of external torque. The above equation
reassures one that the cat, nevertheless, can change its average angle by a
proper combination of angular and radial motions.

4 The Average Angle Concept

The concept of an ‘average angle’ requires some comment. The value of this
angle will, of course, depend on the direction of the ﬁxed reference direction
(the X-axis). It will also depend on whether one thinks of ϕ as going from −π
to π or if it goes from 0 to 2π, when one assigns initial values to the ϕk. That
is, ϕav depends on whether the necessary 2π jump comes at the negative or at
the positive X-axis, respectively. For a cylinder the initial average angle will
be zero in the former case and π in the latter. The actual value of the average
angle therefore has little physical meaning; its signiﬁcance comes from the
fact that it deﬁnes a reference direction in the particle system. Then, when
the system has moved, it will tell how large, on average, the net turn has
been.

The time dependence of the averaging naturally vanishes if the radii, ρk,
are constant. It is interesting to note that it also vanishes in the more general
case when the time dependencies of the (cylindrical) radii are of the form

ρk(t) = f (t) dk,

(13)

5

where f (t) is some (positive) function of time and the dk are constants. The
average then becomes

hγ(t)it = P

N

k=1 mkf 2(t) d2

k γk(t)

N

k=1 mkf 2(t) d2

k

P

= P

N

k=1 mkd2

k γk(t)

N

k=1 mkd2

k

P

= hγ(t)i.

(14)

For this case then, when the cylindrical radial motion is a common ‘scaling’,
the time derivative operator commutes with the operation of taking the av-
erage. Consequently the average angular velocity will be the time derivative
of the average angle and similarly for angular acceleration.

5 K¨onig’s Theorem

The kinetic energy of an N-particle system is given by the sum

If one introduces the center of mass position vector

and then re-writes the position vectors of the particles as

the kinetic energy is seen to fall into two parts. One part corresponds to the
motion of the center of mass of the system while the remaining part is due
to the motion of the particles relative to the center of mass system:

Here m =

k=1 mk is the total mass and T ′, which is given by

the center of mass is at rest. The absence of cross terms is due to the

K¨onig’s theorem (see Synge and Griﬃth 1970), or the ‘law of the two parts
of the kinetic energy’, if it is given any name at all. It is this result that can
be taken a step further according to Jellinek and Li (1989) in the sense that
T ′ can be split into two parts, one corresponding to an overall rotation and
the rest corresponding to the motion relative to the rotating system. This is
shown in the next section.

6 The Average Angular Velocity Vector

The quantities of this section may be thought of as referring to the center of
mass system but we will drop the primes of the previous section. Introduce
spherical coordinates (rk, θk, ϕk) for particle k and corresponding moving
basis vectors (erk , eθk, eϕk). The position vector, rk, of particle k is then

and the velocity of the particle is

rk = rk erk.

˙rk = ˙rk erk + ωk × rk.

Here ωk is the angular velocity of the position vector of particle k. It is given
by

ωk = ˙ϕk cos θk erk − ˙ϕk sin θk eθk + ˙θk eϕk = ˙ϕk ez + ˙θk eϕk.

(22)

The kinetic energy of the N-particle system is now

Below we will need to manipulate sums of terms like those in the above

cated by the index k). In order to proceed we therefore return to a common
Cartesian basis in the expression 1

i.e. the usual (instantaneous) inertia tensor for the system of particles.

We now deﬁne the average angular velocity vector, ωav, by

as the inertia tensor weighted average of the individual particle angular ve-
locity vectors. Here it is necessary that ˆJ is invertible so that one can solve
for ωav by multiplying to the left by ˆJ −1. This means that the particles of
the system may not lie on a line since then the inertia tensor is singular.

If we now denote by ω′

k the angular velocity vector of particle k relative
to the reference system that rotates with the average angular velocity we
have

7 Remarks on the Conservation Laws

One notes that formula (29) is nothing but the total angular momentum, L,
of the system (with respect to the center of mass):

It is thus analogous to the formula

ˆJ ωav =

ˆJkωk = L.

m ˙R =

mk ˙rk = p

for the total linear momentum, p, of the system. Using the linear and angular
momenta the total kinetic energy of a system can now be written

T =

p · p +

ˆJ −1L · L + T ′′.

1
2m

Here m is the total mass, which is always constant, and p the total linear
momentum, which is constant in the absence of external force. Thus in the
absence of a net external force on the system the ﬁrst term in this expression
for T is constant. What about the second term? In the absence of a net

external moment (of force) on the system L is constant, but the (inverse)
inertia tensor ˆJ −1 is, in general, not since it depends on the ‘shape’ of the
system.

In an isolated body, such as a star or planet, one can expect that internal
dissipative forces, in the long run, will make the internal relative motions zero
so that T ′′ → 0. Such bodies will thus end up having only center of mass
translational and average rotational energy and both will then be constant.

8 Conclusions

The ﬁxed axis formalism at the beginning of this paper is simple and useful
enough to be included in even fairly elementary texts, though I believe it
is presented here for the ﬁrst time in the international literature.
I have
introduced part of it in course notes that are used in the school of engineering
physics at KTH. The point of view that the Jellinek and Li (1989) separation
of a rotational part of the kinetic energy is analogous to the well known
separation of center of mass translational energy, is pedagogically useful at
higher levels, and the general ideas deserve to be better known.
It is the
opinion of the author that most of the equations and results of this paper,
in fact, belong in a comprehensive advanced mechanics course.

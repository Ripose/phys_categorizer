Propagation of an electromagnetic pulse through a waveguide with a barrier: A time
domain solution within classical electrodynamics

(November 1, 1996)

An electromagnetic truncated Gaussian pulse propagates through a waveguide with piecewise
diﬀerent dielectric constants. The waveguide contains a barrier, namely a region of a lower dielectric
constant compared to the neighboring regions. This set-up yields a purely imaginary wave vector
in the region of the barrier (’electromagnetic tunneling’). We exactly calculate the time-dependent
Green’s function for a slightly simpliﬁed dispersion relation. In order to observe the plain tunneling
eﬀect we neglect the distortions caused by the wave guide in obtaining the transmitted pulse. The
wave front of the pulse travels with the vacuum speed of light. Nevertheless, behind the barrier, the
maximum of the transmitted pulse turns up at an earlier time than in the case without an barrier.
This eﬀect will be explained in terms of the energy ﬂow across the barrier. The solutions obtained
reproduce the shape of the pulses measured in the tunneling experiments of Enders and Nimtz [4–8].

I. INTRODUCTION

Tunneling is, like interference, a characteristic prop-
erty of waves. This eﬀect occurs both in non-relativistic
quantum mechanics and in electrodynamics. Although
the time dependent diﬀerential equations of both theories
are fundamentally diﬀerent in their structure, theoreti-
cal calculations yield analogous results for the traversal
time of the maximum of a wave packet’s modulus. These
calculations are based on the stationary phase approx-
imation [1,2] as well as on a scattering ansatz [3]. For
suﬃciently long barriers, the time delay is independent
of the thickness and, thus, can correspond to arbitrary
large eﬀective velocities of the maximum of a pulse for
crossing the barrier. This prediction is in agreement with
results obtained by Nimtz and Enders in tunneling exper-
iments with evanescent microwaves in a waveguide with
a frequency below cut-oﬀ [4–8]. In these experiments the
evanescent waveguide region, i.e. the barrier, is realized
by an undersized region in between normal sized regions
of a waveguide line. Due to the inhomogeneous cross
section of the waveguide, we couldn’t obtain an analytic
expression for the transmission coeﬃcient. Therefore, a
recent microwave experiment [9] studied a barrier pro-
duced by a low-dielectric-constant (ǫ2) region which was
placed in a rectangular waveguide of the same cross sec-
tion, ﬁlled with a higher dielectric constant ǫ1. This ex-
perimental set-up is illustrated in Fig. 1. The relation
between wave number k and frequency ω is given by the
dispersion formula (with the vacuum speed of light set to
c = 1)

k = √ǫ

ω2

ω2

c /ǫ

−

p

(1.1)

where ωc represents the cut-oﬀ frequency of the empty
waveguide and ǫ is the variable dielectric constant [10].
Therefore a wave of frequency ω0 with ω2
0 <

c /ǫ1 < ω2

ω2
c /ǫ2 possesses a real wave number k outside the bar-
rier, but on entering the tunnel region with a lower di-
electric constant k becomes imaginary, and the wave will
spatially decay.

In this paper we will consider the electrodynamic tun-
neling for a barrier given by a variable dielectric constant.
This set-up is amenable to a rigorous mathematical de-
scription. It was theoretically investigated ﬁrst by Martin
and Landauer [3]. They concentrated on the tunneling of
a Gaussian pulse with a narrow frequency range. Using
a scattering ansatz they showed that the time delay of
the center of mass depends only on the frequency deriva-
tive of the phase of the transmission coeﬃcient. For suf-
ﬁciently long barriers, this delay becomes independent
of thickness and thus corresponds to an arbitrary large
eﬀective velocity of the center of mass for crossing the
tunnel region, which is known as the Hartman eﬀect [1]
and has been experimentally veriﬁed ﬁrst by Enders and
Nimtz [5].

We want to examine how this eﬀect is related to causal-
ity. To carry out this goal, the fundamental solution of
the given set-up, the retarded Green’s function, will be
constructed analytically assuming causality. This means

1

that this function vanishes outside the past light cone,
i.e. the wave front travels with the vacuum speed of light.
With the aid of this solution we will give an analytic ex-
pression for the entire transmitted pulse, which has the
observed superluminal property of the center of mass. In
addition this allows us to determine the deformation of
the pulse caused by crossing the barrier. It is assumed
that the initial pulse is given by a truncated Gaussian
wave packet located only to the left of the barrier.

II. GREEN’S FUNCTION

A. The Model

The Green’s function will be obtained using a Laplace
transform. The structure of the dipersion formula (1.1)
prevents an analytic inversion of this transformation be-
cause of the diﬀerent coeﬃcients in front of ω2 outside
and inside the barrier, respectively. Therefore we con-
sider in this paper a simpliﬁed model for the electromag-
netic tunneling eﬀect with dispersion formulas given by

k =

(2.1)

with √ǫ coeﬃcients dropped and cut-oﬀ frequencies
m1 = ωc/√ǫ1 and m2 = ωc/√ǫ2 outside and inside the
barrier, respectively. The transmission coeﬃcient of the
barrier does not change qualitatively under this simpli-
ﬁcation. The model given by these dispersion formulas,
together with the Maxwell equations, still represents an
electrodynamic case of tunneling. Within this model the
velocity of a wave front limk→∞ ω(k)/k = 1 is always
given by the vacuum speed of light and it is assumed that
the dielectric medium inﬂuences only the cut-oﬀ frequen-
cies themselves. A similar model consisting of a classical
scalar ﬁeld which satisﬁes the one-dimensional relativis-
tic Klein-Gordon equation with a rectangular potential
barrier was investigated by Deutch and Low [11]. Under
the condition that the tunneling amplitude is very small,
they found an approximate solution given by a Gaussian
wave packet, which turns up on the right hand side of
the barrier as if its maximum took zero time to cross
the barrier. Our goal here is to ﬁnd an exact solution of
the Maxwell equations yielding exact values for the tun-
neling time of the maximum of a Gaussian wave packet,
which can be compared to the approximate results given
by Martin and Landauer. Furthermore, taking truncated
wave packets of variable variance, the inﬂuence of these
attributes on the tunneling time will be studied.

Suppose that an electromagnetic pulse has been gen-
erated in the region to the left of the barrier by an ap-
propriate current which has vanished already before the
wave front of the pulse reaches the left end of the barrier.
The propagation of this pulse is then determined by the
dispersion formulas together with the Maxwell equations

δ¯x,

with vanishing charge current. One can obtain the propa-
gated ﬁeld behind the barrier by solving these equations
with the pulse located in front of the barrier as initial
condition. This can be done with the aid of the retarded
Green’s function. In the case of the electromagnetic ﬁeld,
this fundamental solution can be written as an antisym-
metric tensor G¯xαβ, (α, β = 0, . . . , 3), satisfying the four
dimensional wave equation with the Dirac distribution at
the ﬁxed space-time position ¯x as inhomogeneity
✷G¯x =

where ✷ = ∂2

3 is the Laplace-Beltrami-
operator of the Minkowskian space time [12]. Beyond
that, G¯x must allow for the following boundary condi-
tions: First, it has to vanish outside the past light cone
at ¯x, second its six components have to jump in the re-
spective correct manner at the two boundaries between
the propagating and the evanescent region and must take
into account the metallic boundary conditions on the sur-
face of the waveguide. In the next section, we will give a
solution of this boundary value problem where the axial
magnetic component G¯x12 of Green’s function shall serve
as example. Given the relevant ﬁeld components in front
of the barrier at the time x0 = 0, the expression

B. Analysis

We solve the time dependent wave equation (2.2) by
a Laplace transform relative to the time x0 for a ﬁxed
¯x with the property ¯x0 > 0. The Laplace transform
yields, after inversion, a function in the time domain
which vanishes until a certain time is reached. Therefore
this method is only suitable to get the advanced Green’s
function. The retarded Green’s function, though, can
then be obtained by a simple time reﬂection.

This tensor describes the x1- and x2-dependence of

bers (ι, η). Here we have introduced a one dimensional
Green’s function ˜gαβ(¯x3, x3) to account for the depen-
dence on the axial coordinate x3. Only this function
contains the dependence on the frequency and will there-
fore deﬁne the time evolution of the ﬁeld. Applying the
transformed wave equation (2.2) to Eq. (2.6), we ﬁnd
that the one dimensional Green’s function has to be a
solution of the ordinary diﬀerential equation given by

Notice that the cut-oﬀ frequencies m1 and m2 change
with the type of mode. Thus the one dimensional Green’s
function also depends on the numbers (ι, η). In Eq. (2.10)
no boundary terms at zero time emerge from the Laplace
transform of the second time derivative due to the van-
ishing of the advanced Green’s function for x0 < ¯x0 and
the property ¯x0 > 0.

with the total antisymmetric tensor ǫαβ. The wave num-
bers k and κ are given by the dispersion formulas (2.1).
Due to the upper half plane analyticity of a Laplace
transformed function, the square roots in these equations
have to be chosen analytic in the upper ω half plane.
Hence the wave numbers always have a positive imagi-
nary part. The respective coeﬃcients Rαβ, Aαβ, Bαβ and
Tαβ are uniquely determined by the boundary conditions
at the two planes deﬁning the evanescent region between
ℓ/2 and x3 = ℓ/2. The coeﬃcients of both solu-
x3 =
tions are assumed to be equal because of the symmetry
of the barrier relative to x3 = 0. Taking into account
that the imaginary part of k is positive, the asymptotic
behavior of the two solutions looks like

The case x3 < ¯x3 with x3 <

interesting one for the investigation of the tunneling time

is suitable to calculate the ﬁeld behind the barrier for a

the barrier. In this case the Green’s function reads

We now must consider the respective matching condi-

evaluate the coeﬃcients of the two solutions. For simplic-
ity let us only look at the calculations for the component
B3. This component has to be continuous at x3 =

and x3 = ℓ/2. Furthermore we need the behavior of its

of the barrier. The transverse components B1 and B2 are
continuous at any position of the two boundary-planes.
Hence its partial derivatives parallel to the boundary-
planes, i.e. the x1- and x2-derivatives, also have to be
continuous at these planes. The equation div ~B = 0 shows
that the x3-derivative of the component B3 is continuous
at the boundary-planes, too. These four continuity con-
ditions together yield the coeﬃcients of the correspond-

In the case of the component B3 we now have to

Note that the expression k + κ never vanishes in the up-

The structure of this Green’s function can be explained
phenomenologically by looking at Eq. (2.32). Even the
leading term q0 of the series, and thus h0, jumps from
zero to a ﬁnite value at the boundary of the past light
cone. This property of Green’s function guarantees the
causal propagation of every pulse. In opposition to the
free space here the support of Green’s function is not
only the boundary of the light cone but its full interior.
There are two reasons for this feature. First, consider the
ﬁrst term in Eq. (2.32) and accordingly the terms of the
series qν given by Eq. (2.30). These terms contribute to
the series only when t > z + 2νℓ. Thus the νth term of
the series represents the part of the ﬁeld that leaves the
barrier on the right hand side after 2ν reﬂections at its
boundaries. For the second reason take a look at the sec-
ond term of Eq. (2.32). This term has nothing to do with
the barrier itself but arises from the boundary conditions
of the wave guide. Notice that the ﬁeld is reﬂected there
and back from the metallic boundaries while propagat-
ing through the waveguide. This echo eﬀect is described
by the integral of the term in question. This integral
represents a distortion in which all excitations that are
noticeable at a given position in the time interval [0, t]
take part.

system has been mapped onto the model investigated by

to our eﬀective cut-oﬀ frequency m0 =

tice that, for comparing with experimental results, the
contribution of the distortion term to the total transmit-
ted pulse decreases with an increasing diﬀerence between
the lower cut-oﬀ frequency m1 and the central frequency

A. Analysis

with the Gaussian envelope

Now we will solve the Maxwell equations for a given
pulse using Green’s function determined in the last sec-
tion. Before starting with this calculation we want to
simplify Green’s function. It has been noticed above that
a distortion integral like that of Eq. (2.32) always arises
in the case of guided waves. However, the tunneling ef-
fect itself is described completely by the functions fν(t, z)
in the ﬁrst term of Eq. (2.32). We are interested in the
undistorted delay induced by the tunneling eﬀect only.
Therefore, in the following calculations we consider only
this term of Green’s function, i.e. we set

The distance between the maximum and the wavefront of
the packet is given by the parameter γ with the property
0 < γ <
ℓ/2. The upper boundary of γ comes from
the condition that the wavefront of the initial pulse has
to be in front of the barrier at x0 = 0. This is neces-
sary because the barrier causes deformations of the pulse
which are initially unknown.

The integral in Eq. (3.6) can be evaluated only numeri-
cally. Note that, for a ﬁxed value of u, all of the functions
Γ(1,2)
(u) with an index ν larger than some index ν0 van-
ν
ish. Naturally, the index ν0 depends on the value of u.
So we have to do only a ﬁnite number of numerical in-
tegrations to obtain the component B3. The envelope of
B3 is shown in Fig. 2 for diﬀerent barrier thicknesses ℓ
and ﬁxed central and cut-oﬀ frequencies. The distance
γ between the maximum and the wave front of the wave
packet has to be large enough to prevent deformations
of the transmitted pulse that arise in the case of a pulse
with too large high-frequency components. For this and
the following results γ has been chosen to be ﬁve times
the initial variance σ0 of the pulse. Due to the trivial
dependence of the solution on the coordinate x1 we have
always set x1 = 0 corresponding to the boundary of the
waveguide. Because we have eliminated the echo eﬀect
caused by the waveguide itself, the pulse does not change
its shape outside the barrier region. Thus the graphs in
Fig. 2 correspond to the time evolution of the wave packet
measured by an observer at an arbitrary position behind
the barrier. To determine the tunneling time of the max-
imum of the wave packet, we can use the free propagation
of the wave packet outside the barrier, i.e. the fact that
it travels there with the vacuum speed of light without
changing its shape. Then the maximum of the packet ar-
rives at the left end of the barrier at x0 =
ℓ/2. Now
let τ be the value of u at which the envelope of B3(u)
has its maximum. Considering the deﬁnition of the co-
ordinate u, one obtains for the arrival time at the right
end of the barrier x0 = τ
ℓ/2. Thus the tunneling

time is given by τ .

FIG. 2. Graphs of the envelope of the component B3 of the
magnetic ﬁeld for Gaussian wave packets transmitted below
cut-oﬀ across barriers of diﬀerent thickness ℓ as a function of
the relative coordinate u. The cut-oﬀ frequencies are m1 = 1
and m2 = 4. In all cases ω0 = 3.2 and σ = 10. The graphs
are scaled by the factors in the brackets.

The graphs in Fig. 2 show that the transmitted pulses
are also Gaussian-like wave packets, but exponentially
damped with growing barrier thickness. To obtain the
tunneling time and the variance of the packets we have
ﬁtted Gaussian wave packets to the graphs of Fig. 2. The
resulting values for τ and the variance σ are listed in
Table I. Furthermore, this table shows values also corre-
sponding to Gaussian-like solutions for other cut-oﬀ fre-

account for this fact, we compare the tunneling times of
our echo-free solutions with that of Martin and Landauer
by taking in Eq. (3.9) the phase of the transmission coef-
ﬁcient with m1 = 0, corresponding to a free propagation
outside the barrier. The graph of τML and our values of
τ are plotted in Figs. 3 and 4 as functions of the central
frequency and the barrier thickness, respectively, for the
parameters considered above. A diﬀerence between the
two tunneling times arises only for higher central frequen-
cies because of the growing contribution of high Fourier
components to the transmitted pulse. Notice that the ap-
proximate result of Martin and Landauer is valid only for
pulses with a narrow frequency range. Furthermore our
values for the tunneling time retains a small dependence
on thickness, but corresponds nevertheless to a superlu-
minal velocity for the maximum of the pulse. At this
moment it should be emphasized again that the wave
front travels always with the vacuum speed of light. Be-
low, the possibility of superluminal maxima within an
underlying causal propagation will be explained in terms
of the energy ﬂow across the barrier.

quencies of which the graphs are not shown here. While
in the case of ℓ = 0.5 the tunneling time corresponds to a
subluminal average velocity of the maximum, it increases
more and more slowly with growing barrier thickness.
This result agrees with the experimental observation that
for suﬃciently long barriers the tunneling time is inde-
pendent of thickness [5]. The variance of the transmitted
wave packets decreases with increasing barrier thickness.
To determine the dependence of the tunneling time
on the central frequency of the initial pulses we have
calculated the corresponding transmitted wave packets
for a barrier of ﬁxed thickness ℓ = 5 with m1 = 1 and
m2 = 4. We have considered Gaussians with variances
both above (σ0 = 10) and below (σ0 = 4) the thick-
ness. The resulting pulses are also Gaussian-like except
m2/2. The param-
for the low-variance-pulses with ω0
eters of the Gaussian solutions are given by Table II. The
tunneling time increases with the central frequency but
corresponds always to a superluminal average velocity for
the maximum of the pulse. The maxima are shifted to
higher values of τ with increasing ω0 because of contribu-
tions from Fourier components above the barrier cut-oﬀ.
These components are also responsible for the slightly
higher times of the narrow packets and its distortion at
higher central frequencies. The variance of the transmit-
ted packets decreases with increasing ω0.

Let us now compare the tunneling times obtained from
our solutions with that of Martin and Landauer [3].
These authors have pointed out that the time delay of
the center of mass for a pulse restricted to a wide vari-
ance in the time domain depends only on the frequency
derivative of the phase α of the transmission coeﬃcient,
i.e.

τML =

where the expression has to be evaluated at ω = ω0. Due
to the symmetry of the transmitted pulse the time delay
for the center of mass and the maximum are the same.
But the time τML does not represent the pure time delay
of the maximum caused by the barrier itself: Due to the
echo eﬀect of the waveguide which also aﬀects the trans-
mission coeﬃcient, τML is shifted to higher values. To

Apparently, the maxima of the solutions we have given
above cross the barrier with a superluminal velocity. In
this section, we want to explain this property of the trans-
mitted wave packet in terms of the energy ﬂow across
the barrier. In Minkowskian space-time it is given by the

The fact that
ﬁeld induces an important property of its integral curves
in space-time: Curves with diﬀerent initial positions do
not intersect each other. This property is not destroyed
by the jumping conditions for the electromagnetic ﬁeld
at the ends of the barrier. To prove this claim we have
to show only that any curve ﬂowing on a boundary of
the barrier from one side has a unique continuation at
the other side of the boundary. This means that there
are no branching points for the curves at the boundary.

the curves were tangential to the boundary at this posi-

that comes, for example, from the right, is tangent to
the boundary and than goes back to the right. At the
position where the curve is tangential to the boundary,
another curve could ﬂow into this curve from the other
side of the boundary, leading to a branching point. But
this situation is not possible because the tangential vec-
tors of the curves have to point in the directions of the
future light cone. Looking at the neighboring curves of
those considered above, these possible directions would

FIG. 5. A qualitative plot of the energy ﬂow in a

density.

So we obtain the qualitative picture for the integral
curves of the energy ﬂow in the space-time shown in Fig.
5. The curves originate in the initial pulse of which the
wave front is still to the left of the barrier at time x0 = 0.
The curve originating in the wave front of the pulse has a
slope of one because the wave front propagates with the
vacuum speed of light. The fact that the curves do not
intersect each other allows the initial pulse to be decom-
posed into two connected parts from which transmitted
and reﬂected curves, respectively, originate. If there is
no energy absorbed by the barrier, the starting position
s of the bifurcation curve separating transmitted and re-
ﬂected curves is given implicitly by the transmitted por-
tion of the energy of the initial pulse, i.e.

The integration along the time axis can be done at any
position x3 = p behind the barrier.

Now, by means of the energy ﬂow as shown in Fig. 5,
we want to explain the existence of solutions with su-
perluminal maxima within a causal theory. The part of
the initial pulse between its wave front and the starting
point s of the bifurcation curve is mapped along the en-
ergy ﬂow on the time axis at x3 = p. The closer two
neighboring points of the initial pulse at x0 = 0 are to
the starting point s of the bifurcation curve, the more
the distance between them is extended by this mapping.

8

This is necessary because of the arrival of transmitted
curves at x3 = p also at arbitrary late times. Due to
this spreading of the curves the energy density of the
transmitted pulse at x3 = p begins to decrease from a
particular time corresponding to the arrival time of the
maximum behind the barrier. In other words, the trans-
mitted pulse results from a redistribution of the energy
contained in the forward tail between the front and s of
the starting pulse. Thus the maxima of the initial and
transmitted pulse are not causally related.

The whole picture arises as a consequence of the math-
ematical claim that the curves do not intersect each
other. These curves themselves, of course, cannot be ob-
served in any experiment. But we believe that they are a
suitable tool to get a classical picture of the mechanism
of the tunneling eﬀect. Within this classical interpreta-
tion the surprising result of our solutions is the almost
exact reconstruction of a Gaussian wave packet behind
the barrier. This eﬀect yields a pulse-reshaping [1].

To obtain a more physical point of view one can ask
at which time the transmitted pulse exceeds an arbitrary
threshold behind the barrier. Due to the damping and
squeezing of the transmitted pulse this happens always
at a later time compared to a pulse which crosses no bar-
rier. That means for an observer behind the barrier that
he would not detect the tunneled pulse earlier than the
freely propagated one, in agreement with causality.

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

In Eq. (3.5), we have given an exact analytic expres-
sion in the time domain for the causal Green’s function
of a model that describes an ideal case of electromag-
netic tunneling. The structure of this function allows for
a reduction to those terms which describe only the pure
tunneling eﬀect without the distortions caused by the
waveguide. With this reduced Green’s function, we calcu-
lated the shape of transmitted wave packets for truncated
Gaussians as initial pulses. The resulting pulse can be
also Gaussian-like. In agreement with the approximate
result of Martin and Landauer [3] and the experiments
on microwaves by Enders and Nimtz [5], the time delay of
the maximum of the pulse becomes nearly independent of
the thickness for suﬃciently long barriers. Furthermore,
the variance of the transmitted packet decreases with in-
creasing barrier thickness. By examining the properties
of the energy ﬂow, we have found consistency of a super-
luminal pulse maximum with the causality of Maxwell’s
theory.

Within this interpretation the energy of the transmit-
ted pulse can only originate from a connected part be-
hind the wave front of the initial wave packet because the
integral curves of the energy ﬂow do not intersect each
other. In this sense, the Gaussian shape of the transmit-
ted pulse can only be interpreted as an amazing interfer-
ence eﬀect. Due to the propagation of the wave front with
the vacuum speed of light, it is not possible to obtain a
superluminal maximum if the barrier thickness exceeds
the distance between the maximum and the wave front.
Thus, in the case of truncated wave packets, the time
delay of the maximum does not stay independent of the
thickness for all barrier length. In summary, the results
of the tunneling experiments can be obtained from the
causal Maxwell theory.

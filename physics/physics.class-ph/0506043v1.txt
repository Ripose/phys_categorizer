An Ignored Mechanism
for the Longitudinal Recoil Force in Railguns and
Revitalization of the Riemann Force Law

Abstract – The electric induction force due to a time-varying current is used to account
for the longitudinal recoil force exerted on the rails of railgun accelerators. As observed in
the experiments, this induction force is longitudinal to the rails and can be the strongest
at the heads of the rails. Besides, for the force due to a closed circuit, it is shown that the
Riemann force law, which is based on a potential energy depending on a relative speed and
is in accord with Newton’s law of action and reaction, can reduce to the Lorentz force law.

1. Introduction
It is known that a railgun utilizes the magnetic force to accelerate an armature to move along
two parallel rails on which it is placed. Further, it has been reported that a recoil force,
which is longitudinal to the rails and is exerted on them, was observed during the acceleration
of the armature [1]. Based on the Biot-Savart (Grassmann) force law, the magnetic force
exerted on a wire segment of directed length dl1 and carrying a current I1 due to another
current element I2dl2 is given by

where ˆR is a unit vector pointing from element 2 to element 1 and R is the separation
distance between them. By using a vector identity it is readily seen that the magnetic force
is always perpendicular to the wire segment carrying the current I1. Thus the longitudinal
force cannot be accounted for by the Biot-Savart force law.

Alternatively, in some experiments the Amp`ere force law

is applied to account for this longitudinal recoil force [1], though this force law is not well
accepted. From this law it seems that the longitudinal force can be expected. However,
it can be shown that the force predicted from the Amp`ere law is identical to the one from
the Biot-Savart law, when the force is due to a closed circuit with uniform current as it is
ordinarily. Such an identity has also been proved by two elegant but similar approaches by
using vector identities [2, 3], where the current is given by a volume density as it is actually
and the singularity problem which occurs when the distance R becomes zero for the self-
action term is then avoided. In these derivations the magnetostatic condition, under which

(1)

(2)

the divergence of the current density is zero, is assumed. A closed circuit with uniform current
is a common case of this condition. Some speciﬁc analytical or numerical integrations with
volume or even surface current densities [4, 5] also support the identity. Thereby, without
doubt, the Amp`ere law is identical to the Biot-Savart law for the force due to closed circuits
and hence the longitudinal recoil force can be accounted for by neither of them. In spite of
these theoretical arguments, there remains controversy over the experimental observations
of the railgun longitudinal force and the experimental demonstrations for the validity of the
force laws [6–11].

In this investigation, it is pointed out that the railgun longitudinal force can be ac-
counted for by the electric induction force which as well as the Biot-Savart magnetic force is
incorporated in the Lorentz force law. This induction force is due to a time-varying current
and its direction is longitudinal to the current. This force is of the same order of magnitude
of the magnetic force, but it appears to be ignored in the literature dealing with railguns.
As to the Amp`ere force law, it has an appealing feature that it is obviously in accord with
Newton’s third law of motion. This is a consequence of the situation that the Weber force
law and hence the Amp`ere force law can be derived from a potential energy of which the
involved velocity is a relative velocity between two associated charged particles. In section 5
it is shown that the Riemann force law, which is derived from a potential energy where the
involved velocity is also relative, can reduce to the Lorentz force law. Thus the longitudinal
rail recoil force can be accounted for by a force law which is in accord both with the nowadays
standard theory and with Newton’s law of action and reaction.

2. Electric Induction Force in Railguns
It is well known that in the presence of electric and magnetic ﬁelds, the electromagnetic force
exerted on a particle of charge q and velocity v is given by the Lorentz force law

F = q (E + v

This force law and Maxwell’s equations form the fundamental equations adopted by Lorentz
in the early development of electromagnetics. The Lorentz force law can be given directly
in terms of the scalar and the vector potential originating from the charge and the current
density, respectively. That is,

where Φ is the electric scalar potential and A is the magnetic vector potential. The term
associated with the gradient of the scalar potential, with the time derivative of the vector
potential, and the one with the particle velocity are known as the electrostatic force, the
electric induction force, and the magnetic force, respectively. Quantitatively, the scalar and
the vector potential are given explicitly in terms of the charge density ρ and the current
density J respectively by the volume integrals

scalar potential, both the electric induction force and the magnetic force due to the vector
potential are of the second order of normalized speed with respect to c.

In railgun accelerators, the current I ﬂowing on the loop formed by the rails, the arma-
ture, and the breech generates a magnetic vector potential A and a magnetic ﬁeld B. Then
the current-carrying armature experiences a magnetic force, which tends to accelerate the
armature to move along the rails. Correspondingly, there is another magnetic force exerted
on the breech as a recoil force. Meanwhile, the motion of the armature results in another
magnetic force on the armature itself. This force is along the armature and then will coun-
teract the electrostatic force which in turn is established by an external power supply to
support the current I. The current depends on the resultant force and hence on the speed
of the armature. If the applied voltage is ﬁxed, the current and hence the magnetic vector
potential will decrease. According to the Lorentz force law, a time-varying vector potential
will generate an electric induction force. The electric induction force exerted on the ions
of a straight metal wire carrying a current decreasing with time is parallel to the current.
Thus the net induction force exerted on each rail of a railgun will have a major component
longitudinal to the rails. This force is not expected to depend signiﬁcantly on the location
along each rail, while the forces exerted on the respective rails are in opposite directions.
As the electric induction force is proportional to the time rate of change of the current I, it
depends on the acceleration of the armature.

Fig. 1 The railgun accelerator. The movement of the armature along
the rails constantly introduces new current elements which in turn gen-
erate the electric induction force on the rails.

Another eﬀect of the motion of the armature is to constantly introduce new current
elements located on the rails just behind the armature, where the current changes abruptly
from zero to I, as depicted in Fig. 1. Accordingly, the magnetic vector potential has a
tendency to increase with time. (On the other hand, the current I itself and hence the vector
potential tend to decrease as discussed previously.) This increment of the vector potential
is longitudinal to the rails and hence another electric induction force longitudinal to them
is induced. The vector potential due to the new current elements is given by superposition.
As the currents ﬂowing on the two rail segments of length dx are in opposite directions, the

where x is the distance of the observation position on one rail from the moving armature
and s is the separation distance between the two rails. In the preceding formula the cross
section of the rail is supposed to be vanishing; otherwise, the potential should be evaluated
by a surface integral over the cross section to get a more accurate result for a small x and
to avoid the singularity for a vanishing x. The length dx introduced during the movement
of the armature over a short time interval dt is simply given by vdt, where v is the speed of
the armature with respect to the rails. Thus the corresponding induction force exerted on
an ion of the rail is given by

Iv,

where the force is along the rail and q is the charge of the ion. It is noted that the force is
proportional to the speed of the armature and the current. These dependences are similar to
those for the magnetic force. Thus the induction force is of the same order of the magnetic
force in magnitude. Obviously, this electric induction force is the strongest at the instanta-
neous heads of the rails. This situation agrees with the experimental observation that the
railheads were distorted signiﬁcantly after the launch of the armature [1].

Thus, in railgun accelerators, there are at least two electric induction forces which are
longitudinal to the rails and depend both on the speed and on the acceleration of the arma-
ture. This force can also depend on the location of the armature along the rails, as it deter-
mines the perimeter and the resistance of the loop. Obviously, the electric induction force
vanishes for a substantially stationary armature, which is in agreement with some similar
experiments where it is found that the measured force is identical to the calculated magnetic
force [10, 11]. As the aforementioned induction forces in railguns are in opposite directions,
the resultant induction force exerted on the ions of one rail can be parallel or antiparallel
to the direction of the current. In either case, the induction forces on the respective rails
are diﬀerent in direction, if a direct current is used in stead of an alternating current. This
situation seems not yet observed experimentally and deserves further investigation. Anyway,
the electric induction force should not be ignored in analyzing the longitudinal recoil force
in railguns.

Another mechanism for the recoil force may be the electrostatic force due to internal
sources, which is also ignored in the literature. The electrostatic force is due to charges,
stationary or moving, and can be much stronger than the magnetic and induction forces by
a factor like (v/c)−2.
In the previous discussion of the induction force and the magnetic
If the neutralization is not complete, a
force, electrical neutralization is assumed tacitly.
net electrostatic force will emerge and can dominate over the other forces. According to the
continuity equation, electric charges tend to accumulate at the location where the current
is not uniform, such as the junctions between the rails and the armature and the interface
between two conductors of diﬀerent conductivities. The electrostatic force may be used
to account for the experiment of the repulsion between a suspended π-shaped aluminum
wire and the current-supplying wires, where the ends of the wires are connected to mercury
troughs. In this experiment it was observed that the direction of the repulsion depends on
the direction of the current-supplying wires [8]. Further, the wire fragmentation, where a
metal wire was observed to break into several segments after a high current passed through
it [12], could be ascribed to a complicated process involving a strong electrostatic force.
However, quantitative discussions of these electrostatic forces are diﬃcult.

It is seen that the electric induction force is similar to the magnetic induction force in their
physical origin, where the latter is associated with the term (v

the magnetic force. In the preceding potential energy U, the velocity v and the velocity of
the mobile charged particles involved in the potential A are not relative. Thus the potential
energy and hence the derived force are not frame-invariant under Galilean transformations.
Furthermore, the derived force between two moving charged particles is not in accord with
Newton’s law of action and reaction. On the other hand, it is known that the Lorentz force
law is invariant under the Lorentz transformation.

4. Weber Force Law and Amp`ere Force Law
In as early as 1846, Weber presented a second-order generalization of Coulomb’s law for
electrostatic force. The Weber force law can be derived from a velocity-dependent potential
energy which, for the force exerted on a particle of charge q1 and velocity v1 due to another
particle of charge q2 and velocity v2, is given by [13, 14]

where a12 denotes the relative acceleration. It is noted that the force is always along the
radial direction represented by ˆR and the involved distance, velocity, and acceleration are
all relative between the two particles. Thereby, the Weber force is frame-invariant simply
under Galilean transformations and is in accord with Newton’s law of action and reaction.
Consider the case where the magnetic force is due to a neutralized current where the
mobile charged particles forming the current is actually embedded in a matrix, such as
electrons in a metal wire. The ions that constitute the matrix tend to electrically neutralize
the mobile particles. Suppose that the various ions and hence the neutralizing matrix move
at a ﬁxed velocity vm. Thus the mobile charged particles drift at the speed v2m relative
to the matrix. Ordinarily, the drift speed v2m is quite low due to the collision of electrons
against ions. Thus, based on the Weber force law, the force due to a neutralized current
element exerted on a charged particle of relative velocity v1m can be given by superposing
the forces due to the electron and ion. Thus one has the force law between the current
element and the particle

where it has been supposed that the drift speed v2m is suﬃciently low as it is ordinarily and
thus those terms associated with the second order of v2m are neglected. It is noted that the
term with a2m is along the direction of ˆR, instead of the direction of a2m itself. Consequently,
the Weber force law disagrees with the Lorentz force law as far as the longitudinal force in
railgun accelerators is concerned.

Consider two neutralized current elements ﬂowing on two wire segments which in turn
are stationary with respect to each other. Then, by superposing the forces exerted on the
electron and ion, one has the force law between the two current elements

F =

This formula is identical to the Amp`ere force law (2), as q1v1m and q2v2m correspond to I1dl1
and I2dl2, respectively. Since v1m and v2m are relative, the Amp`ere force law is Galilean
invariant. And as these velocities appear in a symmetric way, the action of a current element
on itself then cancels out.

5. Riemann Force Law
The electromagnetic force law can be derived alternatively from a potential energy incorpo-
rating the relative speed, instead of the radial relative speed. That is, [13]

(16)

(17)

This velocity-dependent potential energy was introduced by Riemann in 1861 [14] and is
almost ignored at the present time. Then Lagrange’s equation immediately leads to the

as both of the variations of v12 and R contribute to the time derivative. Physically, the
derivative d(v12/R)/dt is associated with the time rate of change in the potential energy
actually experienced by the aﬀected particle. And the term with u12v12 in the preceding
force formula is associated with the variation of the experienced potential energy due to
the relative displacement between the aﬀected and the source particle. It is of essence to
note that the potential energy and the force depend on the relative velocity and distance and
hence they are independent of the choice of reference frames in uniform motion of translation.
Furthermore, the Riemann force law as well as the Weber force law is in accord with Newton’s
third law of motion.

Now we consider the ordinary case where the force is due to a neutralized current element
with a suﬃciently low drift speed v2m. By superposition the Riemann force exerted on a
charged particle moving at a velocity v1m relative to the matrix is then given by

Omitting the acceleration term, a similar force formula between two current elements can
be found in [14]. When the current-carrying wire forms a loop C2 over which the current is

Similarly, for a volume current density under the magnetostatic condition, it can be shown
that the contribution corresponding to that of the term ρlu2m cancels out collectively. It is
noted that the time derivative ∂A/∂t is actually referred to the matrix frame (in which the
matrix is stationary) so that the variation of v2m contributes to this derivative, while the
variation of R does not as its eﬀect has been counted in the term with u1mv2m in (21).

It is of essence to note that the preceding formula looks like the Lorentz force law under
neutralization. However, the current density generating the potential A, the time derivative
of A in the electric induction force, and the particle velocity connecting to
A in the
magnetic force are all referred speciﬁcally to the matrix frame. It is noted that this speciﬁc
frame has been adopted tacitly in common practice with the magnetic and induction forces.
Thus, for the force due to closed circuits, the Riemann force law which is Galilean invariant
and in accord with Newton’s law of action and reaction can be identical to the Lorentz
force law. Recently, based on a wave equation a time evolution equation similar to Schr¨o-
dinger’s equation is derived. From the evolution equation an electromagnetic force given in
a form quite similar to Lagrange’s equation in conjunction with the potential energy (17)
is derived [15, 16]. Thus a quantum-mechanical basis for the Riemann force law has been
provided. Further, the divergence and the curl relations for the corresponding electric and
magnetic ﬁelds are derived. Under the magnetostatic condition, these four relationships
are just Maxwell’s equations, with the exception that the velocity determining the involved
current density is also relative to the matrix [16].

6. Conclusion
It is shown that in railgun accelerators the electric induction force longitudinal to the rails
is generated during the movement of the armature. This force is due to the decrease of the
current and to the newly introduced current elements. Thus it depends on the location,
speed, and acceleration of the armature. This induction force is comparable to the magnetic
force in magnitude and has a tendency to be the strongest at the railheads. Thus it accounts
for the observed longitudinal recoil force exerted on the rails. Besides, we compare the Weber
and the Riemann force law, which are derived from Lagrange’s equation in conjunction
with a potential energy depending on the radial relative speed and on the relative speed,
respectively. For ordinary cases where the force is due to the current on a neutralized and
closed wire with low drift speed, it is shown that the Riemann force law reduces to the Lorentz
force law. Thus the longitudinal force exerted on the rails of railgun accelerators can be well
accounted for by the Riemann force law which is in accord both with the nowadays standard
theory and with Newton’s law of action and reaction.

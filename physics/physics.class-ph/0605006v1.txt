Abstract

We use the fractional integrals to describe fractal solid. We suggest to consider the
fractal solid as special (fractional) continuous medium. We replace the fractal solid with
fractal mass dimension by some continuous model that is described by fractional integrals.
The fractional integrals are considered as approximation of the integrals on fractals. We
derive fractional generalization of the action functional and the Euler-Lagrange equa-
tion for the fractal solid string. The solution of wave equation for fractal solid string is
considered.

1 Introduction

The real fractal structures of matter are characterized by an extremely complex and irregular
geometry [1]. Although the fractal dimensionality does not reﬂect completely the geometric
properties of the fractal solid, it nevertheless permits a number of important conclusions about
the behavior of fractal structures [1, 2, 3, 4]. For example, if it is assumed that matter with a
constant density is distributed over the fractal, then the mass of the fractal enclosed in a volume
RD, whereas for a regular n-
of characteristic dimension R satisﬁes the scaling law M(R)
Rn [1]. Let us assume that a solid can be treated on
dimensional Euclidean object M(R)
a scale R as a stochastic fractal of dimensionality D < 3 embedded in a Euclidean space of
dimensionality n = 3. Naturally, in real objects the fractal structure cannot be observed on all
scales. For example, Katz and Thompson [5] presented experimental evidence indicating that
the pore spaces of a set of sandstone samples are fractals.

In the general case, the fractal solid cannot be considered as a continuous medium. There
are domains which are not ﬁlled by particles. We suggest [6, 7, 8] to consider the fractal solid as
special (fractional) continuous solid. We use the procedure of replacement of the fractal solid
with fractal mass dimension by some continuous solid that is described by fractional integrals.
This procedure is a fractional generalization of Christensen approach [9]. Suggested procedure
leads to the fractional integration and diﬀerentiation to describe fractal solid. The fractional
integrals allow us to take into account the fractality of the solid [6, 7]. In order to describe the

1

fractal solid by continuous model we must use the fractional integrals [10, 11]. The order of
fractional integral is equal to the fractal mass dimension of the solid. More consistent approach
to describe the fractal solid is connected with the mathematical deﬁnition of the integrals on
fractals. It was proved [12] that integrals on net of fractals can be approximated by fractional
integrals. Therefore, we can consider the fractional integrals as approximations of integrals
[14, 15, 16], we proved that fractional integrals can be considered
on fractals [13].
as integrals over the space with fractional dimension up to numerical factor. To prove this
statement, we use the well-known formulas of dimensional regularizations [17].

In Ref.

In this paper, we use the fractional integrals in order to describe dynamical processes in
the fractal solid. In Sec. 2, we consider the fractional continuous model for the fractal solid.
In Sec. 3, we derive the fractional generalization of the stationary action principle and the
Euler-Lagrange equation. In Sec. 4, we consider the solution of wave equation for the fractal
solid string. Finally, a short conclusion is given in Sec. 5.

2 Mass of Fractal Solid

Let us consider a fractal solid. For example, we can assume that mass with a constant density
is distributed over the fractal. In this case, the mass M(W ) on the fractal enclosed in volume
RD, whereas for a regular
with the characteristic size R satisﬁes the scaling law M(R)
n-dimensional Euclidean object we have M(R)

Rn.

where D is a mass fractal dimension of solid, and dVD is an element of D-dimensional volume
such that

The initial points of the fractional integral are set to zero [10]. The numerical factor in Eq.

Here we use Cartesian’s coordinates x, y, and z. In order to have the usual dimensions of the
physical values, we can use vector r, and coordinates x, y, z as dimensionless values.

Note that the interpretation of the fractional integration is connected with fractional di-
mension [14, 15]. This interpretation follows from the well-known formulas for dimensional
regularizations [17]. The fractional integral can be considered as an integral in the fractional
dimension space up to the numerical factor Γ(D/2)/(2πD/2Γ(D)).

Fractal solid is called a homogeneous fractal solid if the power law M(R)
depends on the translation of the region. The homogeneity property of fractal solid can be
formulated in the following form: For all regions W and W ′ of the homogeneous fractal solid
such that the volumes are equal V (W ) = V (W ′), we have that the masses of these regions are
equal M(W ) = M(W ′). Note that the wide class of fractal media satisﬁes the homogeneous
property.
In many cases, we can consider the porous media [18, 19], polymers [20], colloid
aggregates [21], and aerogels [22] as homogeneous fractal media. In Refs. [6, 7], the continuous
medium model of the fractal media was suggested. Note that the fractality and homogeneity
properties can be considered in the following forms:
(1) Homogeneity: The local density of homogeneous fractal solid is a translation invariant value
that has the form ρ(r) = ρ0 = const.
(2) Fractality: The total mass of the ball region W obeys a power law relation M(W )
where D < 3, and R is the radius of the ball.

3 Fractional Action Functional for Fractal Solid String

Let us consider the string that is described by the ﬁeld u(x, t), where 0 < x < l. Suppose that
the density of this string is constant ρ(x, t) = ρ0 = const. Further assume that the string is
stretched with the constant force F0. The kinetic energy of this string is deﬁned by the equation

5 Conclusion

The fractional continuous models for fractal solid can have a wide application. This is due in
part to the relatively small numbers of parameters that deﬁne a fractal solid of great complexity
and rich structure. In many cases, the real fractal structure of matter can be disregarded and
the fractal solid can be replaced by some fractional continuous model [6, 7]. In order to describe
the solid with non-integer mass dimension, we must use the fractional calculus. Smoothing of
the microscopic characteristics over the physically inﬁnitesimal volume transforms the initial
fractal solid into fractional continuous model that uses the fractional integrals. The order of
fractional integral is equal to the fractal mass dimension of the solid. The fractional continuous
model allows us to describe dynamics of wide class fractal media [7, 8, 23, 24, 25].

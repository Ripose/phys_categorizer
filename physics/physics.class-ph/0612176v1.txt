We demonstrate an original approach to acquire nonlinear control over the angular momentum
of a cluster of solitary waves. Our model, derived from a general description of nonlinear energy
propagation in dispersive media, shows that the cluster angular momentum can be adjusted by
acting on the global energy input into the system. The phenomenon is experimentally veriﬁed in
liquid crystals by observing power-dependent rotation of a two-soliton cluster.

Introduction. — Angular momentum (AM) is a fun-
damental quantity, the importance of which has been
highlighted in almost all areas of physical sciences. Evi-
dence of its role is found at the inception of the universe:
although the distribution of galaxies, stars and planets
is still a puzzle in astrophysics, it appears that an ini-
tial angular momentum in the early universe prevented
cluster-sized clouds from collapsing into a series of black
holes, i.e. with no planets to support life [1, 2]. In both
classical and quantum mechanics, angular momentum is
at the basis of rotational dynamics; hence, AM governs
the behavior of important processes such those arising
from ﬂuid motion (e.g. initiation of cyclones [3] and ﬂuc-
tuations in the length of a day [4]), statistical complexes
of rotating molecules [5], quantum optics [6] and quan-
tized particle ensembles. In the latter area, research has
been mostly conducted in two major directions of inves-
tigation:
i) the revolution of trapped particles by their interaction
with classical ﬁelds carrying angular momentum, foster-
ing nanotechnological applications such as rotors or more
complex machines powered by light [7];
ii) the preparation of energy packets in well deﬁned AM
states, with implications to both fundamental physics [8]
and quantum information systems [9].
However, despite the importance of AM in physics and
the vast literature on the subject, neither methods to
nonlinearly control AM have been proposed, nor thor-
ough studies have been carried out on the eﬀect of non-
linearity on the angular momentum of a speciﬁc system.
Conversely, great attention has been devoted in the past
few years to solitons and solitary waves. Such waves
are ubiquitous and rely on the balance between wave-
packet dispersion (spreading) and nonlinearity [10]. Fol-
lowing the pioneering numerical experiments by Fermi,
Pasta and Ulam [11], the universal concept of soliton
has acquired importance in several physical sciences, in-
cluding biology [12], hydrodynamics [10], plasma physics
[13], ultracold atoms [14], optics [15], gravitation [17]
and beyond [16]. By virtue of their robustness, solitons
have potentials in applications — from optical telecom-
munications to atomic interferometry in Bose-Einstein

condensates (BEC)— and are the subject of vigorous
theoretical studies [18]. Recently, the interactions be-
tween two-dimensional deterministic soliton clusters have
attracted interest, encompassing a wealth of dynamics
ranging from wave ﬁlamentation [19], to spinning [20] to
spiraling [21, 22, 23]. Up to date, however, studies fo-
cused on either speciﬁc nonlinear models or particular
input waveforms [19, 21, 22, 23], or on 1D stochastic dy-
namics [30, 31]; none of them discussed the role of the
excitation on the dynamics of a two-dimensional multi-
soliton ensemble.
In this Letter, by employing a rather universal model
for the theory and a nonlocal dielectric for the experi-
ments, we investigate the behavior of a cluster of (2+1)D
optical solitons, demonstrating a nonlinear approach to
controlling its angular momentum. For the sake of sim-
plicity but with no prejudice on its general validity, we
develop the analysis in the simplest case of a two-soliton
cluster, starting from ﬁrst principles and employing the
language of symmetries [24]. We demonstrate that the
angular momentum of a soliton cluster exhibits a linear
dependence on the nonlinear response; hence it can be
precisely managed by varying the input power. The AM
can therefore be evaluated from the global revolution of the
cluster which, for a ﬁxed propagation distance, evolves
linearly with excitation. We check the theoretical re-
sults by a series of experiments in nematic liquid crystals
(NLC), a nonlinear nonlocal medium known to support
stable (2+1)D solitons in voltage-tunable conﬁgurations.
[25, 26, 27].

Theory. — We build a general model of nonlinear
wave propagation, stemming from conservation laws and
variational symmetries (as there is a one-to-one corre-
spondence between them [24]) and considering an iso-
lated medium with translational and rotational invari-
ance. The medium exhibits an optical response nonlinear
with the wave intensity; hence it enforces the conserva-
tion laws of momentum (M), angular momentum (A),
Hamiltonian (H) and energy ﬂux (W), respectively. Such
a nonlinear model is derived by deﬁning a suitable action
d2rdzL, the Lagrangian of which supports
integral I =
the variational symmetries originated by the basis of Lie

stein’s summation over repeated indices), being r = [x, y]
and z dimensionless coordinates and ψα the dimension-
less wave-function of the α−th wave-packet (α ∈ [1, 2] in

model both local —i.e.
and nonlocal [14, 27, 29] responses. By construction,
the Lagrangian (1) admits the symmetries generated by

of solutions to Eq. (2), we are interested in the evolution
of a nonlinear cluster, the solitary “particles” (solitons)
of which are found as invariant solutions of Eq. (2) (writ-
ten for α = β) with respect to the global symmetry group

as the solitons do not collide: the nonintegrable nature of
Eq. (2), in fact, does not guarantee that after collision(s)
the soliton ensemble evolves iso-spectrally [33], i.e. with
a constant number of wavepackets. However, if solitons
simply overlap, the eﬀects of the interaction terms (Θαβ ⊗
|ψβ|2 for α 6= β) can be treated adiabatically, i.e. by
assuming that the latter do not aﬀect the functional form
of the solitons but only their phase µ or their center of
mass rα. Such hypothesis allows us to cast Eq. (7) in
a potential form. By substituting Eq. (8) into (7), after
some straightforward algebra, we obtain:

Noticeably, equation (12) states that:
i) the angular momentum is conserved, hence it is con-
trolled by the system input;
ii) the angular momentum depends linearly on the soli-
ton “mass” m, hence, on the nonlinear potential U .
As a consequence, a change in the soliton global power
d2r(|ψ1|2 + |ψ2|2) results in a linear
variation of AM, provided the adiabatic condition [i.e.

Eqs.
(8)-(11)] holds. To measure the AM observable,
hereby we suggest an original approach exploiting soli-
ton spiraling. Such dynamics occurs when the initial
momentum ˙q(0) = ˙r1(0) − ˙r2(0) balances the attrac-
tive force provided by the bound potential U (q) [21], re-
sulting in a rigid rotation of the (two) soliton ensemble

q, M the “momentum of inertia” of the classical system
(9) [21, 23]. Following a straightforward integration of
L/M = ∂δ/∂z, a measure of soliton cluster AM is given
by the revolution angle δ which, for a given z, varies lin-
early with the angular momentum L. As a result, accord-
ing that the adiabatic condition holds, we expect that the
revolution angle δ of the soliton ensemble evolves linearly
with the soliton input power Pin =

Experiments. — In the experiments we used a pla-
nar glass cell with a 100µm thick layer of planarly an-
chored E7 liquid crystals (Fig. 1). This conﬁguration
is similar to that previously employed for the investiga-
tion of accessible solitons in highly nonlocal media [27],
but with a pre-orientation Ψ0 ≈ 30 with respect to z
in the (y, z) plane to make a voltage bias unnecessary
[34]. We carried out the experiments with a near infrared
(λ = 1.064µm) source and high resolution CCD cameras
for imaging both the soliton output proﬁles and their
propagation in (y, z). At the input, two extraordinary-
wave solitons were excited with opposite momenta along
x, compensating for the walk-oﬀ in (y, z). Particular at-
tention was paid to the tilt in (x, z) in order to achieve
spiraling with (invariant) separation d between the two
“particles”.
The experimental results are summarized in Fig. 2, show-
ing images of light propagating in (y, z) (Fig. 2 a-d) and
output intensity proﬁles in (x, y) (Fig. 2 e-h) for increas-

prediction, as the power increased from 2.1 (Fig. 2a,e)
to 3.9mW (Fig. 2d-h), the cluster AM changed as well,
as witnessed by the rigid rotation of ≈ 180 degrees in
the output plane (Fig. 2e-h). Remarkably enough, each
soliton proﬁle remained nearly unmodiﬁed (Fig. 3a) and
the rotation angle δ evolved linearly with power (Fig.
3b), demonstrating the nonlinear control over the overall
AM angular momentum and in excellent agreement with
the model. Owing to the giant reorientational nonlin-
earity of NLC, the resulting sensitivity ∆δ/∆Pin = π/2
(rad)/mW is quite substantial.

Conclusions. — Stemming from ﬁrst principles and
without speciﬁc assumptions on the dielectric response,
we theoretically disclosed and experimentally demon-
strated an original approach to gain nonlinear control
over the angular momentum of a cluster of (two) spa-
tial solitons. Such nonlinear management of the soliton-
interaction potential
is a remarkable example of all-
optical control over light-induced guided-wave intercon-
nect. Due to the general character of the model (and the

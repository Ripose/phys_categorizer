Abstract

We develope several powerful methods to calculate moments of inertia for certain kind of objects
such as thin plates, solids of revolution, solids generated by contourplots, etc, by using the symmetry
properties of the ﬁgures. The formulae shown in this paper besides saving time and eﬀort considerably,
In particular,
could also provide a deep insight about the properties of this fundamental quantity.
minimization of moments of inertia for certain objects is carried out by using methods of variational
calculus. Furthermore, the methods developed in this paper can be extended easily to calculate other
physical quantities such as centers of mass, products of inertia, electric dipolar momenta etc.

Introduction

It is well known that calculation of moments of inertia (MI) plays a fundamental role in any kind of ap-
plications concerning rotational motion [1]. As well as its importance as a fundamental concept in the
theory of rigid rotator physics, the moment of inertia is a useful tool in applied physics and engineering [2].
Therefore, explicit calculations of moments of inertia for some solids and surfaces are of greatest interest.
Some references have developed alternative methods to facilitate the comprehension of the concept of MI
and the calculations of some well known moments of inertia for beginners [4], other ones try to exploit its
mathematical properties [5], and some of them make an experimental approach to confront with theoretical
results [6]. On the other hand, most of the basic textbooks of mechanics, engineering and calculus, show
some methods to calculate moments of inertia for certain types of ﬁgures [1, 2, 3]. However, they usually
do not exploit the properties of symmetry for the object in question to make the calculation easier. In this
paper, we intend to show some quite general formulae, that permit us to estimate the moment of inertia of
many ﬁgures with considerable saving of time and eﬀort by making proﬁt of their symmetries. We shall see
that these methods will allow us to calculate easily the MI, for a variety of solids for which such calculation
would be very cumbersome by using common techniques. Besides, the formulae given here could be suitable
for an easier implementation of numerical methods when necessary. Finally, we will see that our approach
could provide a new point of view to visualize the mathematical properties of the MI for several kind of
ﬁgures, by using variational calculus.

The paper is organized as follows: in sections 2, 3 we derive expressions for the MI of solids of revolution.
Section 4 shows methods to calculate moments of inertia of solids by using the contourplots of the ﬁgure,
ﬁnding formulae for thin plates as a special case. Section 5, shows some applications of our formulae,
exploring some properties of the MI by using methods of variational calculus. Section 6, is regarded for the
analysis and conclusions. In addition, appendix A displays some formulae to calculate the center of mass of
some ﬁgures, they are useful when we want to calculate the MI of the ﬁgures for an axis that passes through

the center of mass. Appendix B shows speciﬁc examples of the application of our general expressions. Finally,
appendix C shows a table of moments of inertia for a variety of ﬁgures, obtained by applying our methods.

We consider a thin hoop with rectangular cross sectional area equal to (dx) (drx) and perimeter 2πrx
as Figs. (1, 2) display. Our inﬁnitesimal element of volume will be a very short piece of this hoop, lying
between θ and θ + dθ, the length of arc for this short section of the hoop is rx dθ (see Fig. 2). Therefore,
the inﬁnitesimal element of volume and the corresponding diﬀerential of mass, are given by

dV = (dx) (drx) rx (dθ) ; dm = ρ (x, rx, θ) dV ,

(2.2)

In this expression we ﬁrst form the complete hoop (no necessarily closed!), it means that we perform ﬁrst
the integration in θ because when we form the hoop, the x and rx variables are maintained constant and
the integration only involves θ as a variable. After the completion of the hoop, we form a hollow cylinder of
minimum radius f1 (x), maximum radius f2 (x) and height dx. We make it by integrating concentric hoops,
where the radii rx of the hoops run from f1 (x) to f2 (x). Clearly, the variable x is constant in this step of
the integration. Finally, we integrate the hollow cylinders to obtain the solid of revolution, it is performed
by running the x variable from x0 to xf as we can see in Fig 1. This procedure gives us the formula of Eq.
(2.2).

The expression given by Eq. (2.2) is remarkably general, it is valid for any solid of revolution (char-
acterized by the generator functions f1 (x), f2 (x)) which can be totally inhomogeneous (the density might
depends on all the variables x, rx, θ). Even, as we said before, the solid of revolution could be incomplete
i.e. the revolution does not have to be from 0 to 2π. If we assume a complete revolution for the solid with
ρ = ρ (x, rx) the formula simpliﬁes to

For the case of constant density, we only have to now the functions that generates the solid and the limits
in the x coordinate. Hence, for homogeneous solids of revolution (and even for inhomogeneous ones whose

4

R. A. Diaz, W. J. Herrera, and R. Martinez

density depend only on x i.e. the height of the solid), the volume integral involving the calculation of the
moment of inertia is reduced to a simple integral in one variable. We point out that common textbooks
misuse the cylindrical properties of these type of solids, evaluating explicitly all the three integrals even for
homogeneous objects, making the calculation much longer.

2.2 Moment of inertia respect to the Y and Z axes

Let us calculate the moment of inertia of the solid of revolution respect to the Y
element of volume of the previous section. The square distance from the Y
is x2 + r2

x sin2 θ. Therefore, the moment of inertia of this element of volume respect to Y reads

Once again, this formula is valid for any solid of revolution (even incomplete) generated by the functions
f1 (x), f2 (x) and whose density could depend on the three coordinate variables ρ = ρ (x, rx, θ). When
assuming a complete solid of revolution with ρ = ρ (x, rx), and taking into account Eq. (2.3) the latter
formula reduces to

We point out that in the case of a complete revolution, the formula (2.8), coincides exactly with IY in Eq.
(2.6) when ρ is independent of θ, as the cylindrical symmetry indicates. Indeed, for IZ to be equal to IY ,
the requirement of azimuthal symmetry could be softened by demanding the conditions

and the property IZ = IY ≥
From Eqs. (2.5-2.8), we see that for the calculation of the moments of inertia for axes perpendicular to
the axis of symmetry, we use the same limits of integration utilized for the symmetry axis. Thus we do not
have to care about the partitions.

IX /2 is kept as well.

Finally, we emphasize that textbooks do not usually report the moments of inertia for solids of revolution
respect to axes perpendicular to the axis of symmetry. However, they are important in many physical
problems. For instance, a solid of revolution acting as a physical pendulum requires the calculation of such
MI’s, see example 7 in appendix B.1.

By making R = 0 (and/or h = 0) we ﬁnd the radii of gyration for the truncated cone. With R = 0 and
a1 = 0, we get the radii of gyration of a cone for which the axes Y and Z pass through the base of it, while
making R = 0 and a2 = 0, we ﬁnd the radii of gyration of a cone but with the axes Y and Z passing through
its vertex. Finally, by setting up R = 0, and a1 = a2; we obtain the radii of gyration for the cylinder. In
many cases of interest, we need to calculate the moments of inertia for axes XCYC ZC that pass through
the center of mass, these MI’s can be calculated by ﬁnding the position of the center of mass respect to the
original coordinate axes, and using the Steiner’s theorem. Applying Eqs. (A.2-A.4) the position of the center
of mass for the truncated cone with a conical well is given by (xCM , 0, 0) with

2.3 Another alternative of calculation and a proof of consistency

As well as the traditional theorems of the parallel and perpendicular axes that appear in introductory
textbooks, there is another interesting and useful theorem about moments of inertia that is not usually
included in common texts, it is that [7]

IX + IY + IZ = 2

miR2

i ,

i
X

where X, Y, Z are three mutually perpendicular intersecting axes, mi is the mass of the i
th particle and
Ri is its distance from the intersection. The proof is shown in Ref. [7]. Here, we shall demostrate that our
general formulae for the moments of inertia of the solids of revolution, accomplish the theorem. Picking up
the Eqs. (2.2, 2.5, 2.8) we have

−

IX + IY + IZ = 2

moreover, if we take into account that the distance from the intersecting point (the origin of coordinates) to
the element of volume is R2 = x2 + r2

x, and using Eq. (2.1) we conclude that

IX + IY + IZ = 2

which is the continuous version of the theorem established in Eq.
(2.14). As well as providing a very
interesting proof of consistency, this theorem could reduce the task to estimate the moments of inertia, since
V R2dm, could be easier than the direct calculation of them, especially when
sometimes the calculation of
a certain spherical symmetry is involved.

Furthermore, another properties held by the moments of inertia IX , IY , IZ , in Eqs. (2.2,2.5,2.8) are the

triangular inequalities

IX ≤

IY + IZ ,

and same for any cyclic change of the labels. The triangular inequalities are followed directly from the
deﬁnition of MI, and are valid for an arbitrary object. Though the demostration of these inequalities is
straightforward, they are not usually considered in the literature. In the case of thin plates, one of them
becomes an equality.

Example 2 The following example shows the utility of the theorem of Eqs. (2.14, 2.16) in practical calcu-
lations. Let us consider the MI of a sphere centered at the origin, whose density is factorizable in spherical
coordinates such that

ρ(R, ϕ, θ) = ρ(R) ,

where ϕ, θ are the two angles in spherical coordinates, and R is the distance from the origin of coordinates
to the point. By arguments of symmetry we have IX = IY = IZ and the theorem in Eq. (2.16) gives

(1, 0, 0) we have that

where Z is the atomic number and a0 is the Bohr’s radius, from (2.19) and (2.20) IX is given by

3 Moments of inertia for solids of revolution generated around

the Y-axis

By using a couple of generator functions f1 (x) and f2 (x) like in the previous section, we are able to generate
another solid of revolution by rotating such functions around the Y
axis as Fig. 4
0; such that all points in the generator surface
displays. In this case however, we should assume that x0 ≥
have always non-negative x coordinates. Instead, we might allow the functions f1 (x), f2 (x) to be negative
f2 (x) in the whole interval of x. In this case, it is more convenient
though we still demand that f1 (x)
to use another cylindrical system in which we deﬁne the coordinates (ry, y, φ). ry is the distance from the
axis to the point, and the angle φ has been deﬁned such that φ = 0 when the vector radius is parallel to

Figure 6: Contourplots of a solid utilized to calculate its moments of inertia.

Suppose that we know the contourplots of certain solid in the XY plane, i.e. the surfaces shaped by
the intersection between planes parallel to the XY plane and the solid (see Fig. 6). Assume that for a
certain value of the z coordinate, the surface deﬁned by the contour is bounded by the functions f1 (x, z)
and f2 (x, z) in the y coordinate, and by x0 (z), xf (z) in the x coordinate, as shown in the frame on the
upper right corner of Fig. 6. Let us form a thin plate of thick dz with the surface described above. If we
project such thin plate onto the XY plane we can calculate the moment of inertia of this projection respect
to the axes. We calculate ﬁrst the moment of inertia of this projection respect to the X
axis, for which we
divide the projected surface in inﬁnitesimal rectangles of height dy and width dx. The diﬀerential of volume
is given by the surface with area dx dy and with depth dz, i.e. a diﬀerential rectangular box as shown in
Fig. 6. The moment of inertia of this small projected rectangular box respect to the X

axis is

−

−

dIX,A = y2dm = y2ρ (x, y, z) dx dy dz ,

but taking into account that the actual thin plate (of thick dz) is at z units from the XY plane, the real
square distance from the X-axis to the (non-projected) diﬀerential rectangular box is
. Hence, the
real moment of inertia dIX for the inﬁnitesimal rectangular box reads

y2 + z2

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

dIX = dIX,A + z2dm =

y2 + z2

ρ (x, y, z) dx dy dz ,

∗Strictly speaking, we can ﬁnd the moment of inertia of this solid by rotating around the X−axis. We achieve it by splitting
up the ﬁgure in several pieces in the y coordinate, such that each interval in y deﬁnes a function. However, it implies to
introduce more than two generator functions and the number of such generators increases with n, making the calculation more
complex.

Once again, we can check that the results (4.1, 4.2, 4.3) satisfy the theorem (2.14), in its continuous form
Eq. (2.16). As before, the theorem gives us another alternative to calculate the three moments of inertia.
Moreover, the formulae accomplish the triangular inequalities as it must be.

Example 4 General formulae for the moments of inertia of thin plates: For the sake of simplicity, suppose
that the thin plate lies on the XY plane. The superﬁcial density of the plate is denoted by σ (x, y). We can
consider this ﬁgure as a solid generated by contourplots whose volumetric density can be written as

where δ (z) denotes the Dirac’s delta function. Replacing the Eq. (4.4) into the general formula (4.1) we get

Figure 7: Truncated cone with elliptical cross section. The shadowed surfaces show a contour for a certain
value of the z coordinate, as well as its projection onto the XY

Example 5 Let us assume a truncated straight cone with elliptical cross section as shown in Fig. 7. Such
ﬁgure is characterized by the semi-major and semi-minor axes in the base (denoted by a1,b1 respectively), its
height H, and its semi-major and semi-minor axes in the top (denoted by a2, b2 respectively). Suppose that
the truncated cone is located such that the major base lies on the XY plane and the center of such major base
is on the origin of coordinates, as shown in Fig. 7. Now, since we are assuming that the ﬁgure is straight,
then all the contours (see right top on Fig. 7) are concentric ellipses centered at the origin, with the same
excentricity. Therefore, it is more convenient to describe such ellipses in terms of their excentricity ε and
the semi-major axis a (z), the contours are then delimited by

We can check easily that when ε = 0 we ﬁnd the radii of gyration of a truncated cone with circular cross
section. In addition, when ε = 0 and a2 = 0, the radii of gyration reduce to the ones of a cone with the axes
X and Y passing through the base of it. In the case in which ε = 0 and a1 = 0, we also ﬁnd the radii of
gyration of a cone but with the X, Y axes passing through its vertex. By the same token, When ε = 0 and
a1 = a2 we obtain the radii of gyration of a cylinder. Finally, when a2 = 0 we get a cone with elliptical
cross section, and when a1 = a2 we ﬁnd a cylinder with elliptical cross section. On the other hand, if we

5 Useful applications utilizing variational calculus

In all the equations shown in this paper, the moments of inertia can be regarded as functionals of some
generator functions. For the sake of simplicity, let us take a homogeneous solid of complete revolution
around the X
axis with f1 (x) = 0. The moments of inertia are functionals of the remaining generator
function, from Eqs. (2.4, 2.7) and relabeling f2 (x)

f (x), we get

the mass is the constraint and the solid lies in the interval [x0, xf ], of length L.

As a matter of example, suppose that we have a certain amount of material and we wish to make up a
solid of revolution of a ﬁxed length with it, such that its moment of inertia around a certain axis becomes a
minimum. To do it, let us consider a ﬁxed interval [x0, xf ] of length L, to generate a solid of revolution of
mass M and constant density ρ. Let us ﬁnd the function f (x), such that IX or IY become a minimum, see
Fig. 8. Since the mass is kept constant, we use it as the fundamental constraint

In order to minimize IX we should minimize the functional

where λ is the Lagrange’s multiplicator associated to the constraint (5.3). By using the relation [8]

Analizing the second variational derivative we realize that this condition correspond to a minimum. Hence,
IX becomes minimum under the assumptions above for a cylinder of radius √λ, such radius can be gotten
by utilizing the condition (5.3), from which R2 = M/πρL and IX becomes

Now, we look for a function that minimizes the moment of inertia of the solid of revolution respect to an axis

On the other hand, in many applications what really matters are the moments of inertia respect to axes
that pass through the center of mass. In the case of homogeneous and complete solids of revolution the axis
that generates the solid passes through the center of mass, but this is not necessarily the case for an axis
perpendicular to the former. If we are interested in minimizing IYC i.e. the moment of inertia respect to
an axis parallel to Y and that passes through the center of mass; we should write down the expression for
IYC by using the Steiner’s theorem and by combining Eqs. (5.2), (5.3) and (A.2)

We can make a similar procedure for thin plates, what we obtain is that the moment of inertia respect to
an axis contained in the plane of the ﬁgure is minimize by a rectangle; while the moment of inertia for an axis
perpendicular to the plane of the ﬁgure is minimized by a circle. In both cases the ﬁgure is extended along
axis for a distance L and the mass is assumed constant, providing the fundamental constraint.

Finally, it worths to remark that the techniques of functional calculus shown here can be extrapolated
to more complex situations, as long as we look at the moments of inertia as functionals of certain function
generators.

6 Analysis and conclusions

Most of the textbooks report moments of inertia for only a few number of simple ﬁgures. By contrast,
the examples illustrated in this work have been chosen to be more general, and can also cover up many
particular cases. On the other hand, in the speciﬁc case of solids of revolution, only the moment of inertia
respect to the symmetry axis is usually reported. Perhaps the most advantageous feature of the methods
developed in this paper is that the three moments of inertia IX , IY , IZ can be calculated by applying the
same limits of integration, so that the calculation of all of them implies often the same eﬀort. For instance,
any solid of revolution acting as a physical pendulum provides an example in which the MI respect to an
axis perpendicular to the axis of symmetry is necessary, we show up an speciﬁc case in appendix B.1 for
the Gauss’ bell. Moreover, we examine the conditions for these perpendicular moments of inertia to be
degenerate, we ﬁnd that this degeneracy occurs even for inhomogeneous solids as long as the density has
an azimuthal symmetry. Remarkably, even for incomplete solids of revolution with the azimuthal symmetry
broken, such degeneracy may occur under certain conditions.

Finally, we point out that for solids of revolution in which densities depend only on the height of the
solid, the expressions for the moments of inertia become simple integrals, such fact is advantageous even in

Powerful methods to calculate moments of inertia

17

the case in which we cannot evaluate them analytically. Numerical methods typically utilize the geometrical
shape of the body; instead, numerical methods for simple integrals are usually easier to manage.

As for the technique of contourplots, we can realize that many diﬀerent ﬁgures could have the same type
of contours though a diﬀerent modulation of them, one speciﬁc example is the case of a cone with elliptical
cross section and a general ellipsoid, in both solids the contours are ellipses but they are modulated (scaled
with the z coordinate) in diﬀerent ways. On the other hand, in some cases the contours are diﬀerent but
the modulation is of the same type, for example a cone and a pyramid has the same type of modulation
(scaling) but their contours are totally diﬀerent. In both situations we can save a lot of eﬀort making proﬁt
of the similarities. The reader can check the examples 5, 8 and 9, on pages 12, 20, and 21 respectively, in
order to ﬁgure out the way in which we can exploit these similarities in practical calculations.

Furthermore, textbooks always consider homogeneous ﬁgures to estimate the MI, assumption that is not
always realistic. As for our formulae, though they simpliﬁes considerably when we consider homogeneous
bodies, the methods are tractable in many cases when we consider totally inhomogeneous bodies, allowing
us to get more realistic results.

Another interesting annotation: These methods can be generalized for other important physical quanti-
ties. The limits of integration are geometrical so that they are the same if we are interested in calculating
things like center of mass coordinates, the total mass of an inhomogeneous body, charge distributions, prod-
ucts of inertia etc. In appendix A, we write down some formulae to calculate centers of mass for solids of
revolution and for solids built up by contourplots. We see in appendix A, that the same limits of integration
deﬁned for the calculation of the moments of inertia are used to calculate the centers of mass§.

Finally, the formulae shown here permit us to see the MI of a wide variety of ﬁgures as a functional of
certain function generators, making them suitable to explore the properties of the MI by utilizing methods
of the variational calculus. In particular, minimization of the moment of inertia under certain restrictions is
possible by utilizing variational techniques, it could be very useful in applied physics and engineering.

In a real situation the most useful moment of inertia is the one around an axis parallel to the XZ
plane and
that passes through the top of the bell. It is because when the bell tolls, it rotates around an axis perpendicular
to the axis of symmetry that passes the top of the bell. On the other hand, owing to the cylindrical symmetry,

B.2 Examples of moments of inertia by the method of contourplots

straight, the ratios between the sides of the rectangle are constant. We deﬁne a1, b1 the length and width of
the major base; a2, b2 the dimensions of the minor base, and H the height of the solid, from which we have

we suppose that the major base of the truncated pyramid lies on the XY plane centered in the origin with
the lengths a1 parallel to the X
axis. The contours are delimited

very easily

For ﬁxed values of z, what we get are ellipses whose projections onto the XY
plane are centered at the
origin with semi-major axis a (z) and semi-minor axis b (z). The Eqs. (B.2) show that such ellipses have
constant excentricity, and so we arrive to the delimited functions of Eqs. (4.8) with a (z) and b (z) given by
Eqs. (B.2). Therefore, the ﬁrst two integrations are performed in the same way as in the truncated elliptical
cone explained in example 5. Then we can use the result in Eq. (4.10) (except for the limits of integration
in Z, that in this case are [

once again, these axes passes through the center of mass of the ﬁgure.

Observe that the moments of inertia for the general ellipsoid in example 9 were easily calculated by picking
up the results obtained in example 5, for the truncated cone with elliptical cross section; it was because both
ﬁgures have the same type of contours (ellipses) though in each case such contours are modulated (scaled

22

R. A. Diaz, W. J. Herrera, and R. Martinez

with the z coordinate) in diﬀerent ways. This similarity permitted to perform the ﬁrst two integrals in the
same way for both ﬁgures, shortening the calculation of the MI for the general ellipsoid considerably.

As for the truncated cone with elliptical cross section (example 5) and the truncated rectangular pyramid
(example 8), they show the opposite case, i. e. they have diﬀerent contours but the modulation is of the
same type, this similarity also facilitates the calculation of the MI of the truncated pyramid. We emphasize
that this kind of similarities can be exploited for a great variety of ﬁgures, to make the calculation of their
moments of inertia easier and shorter.

It is equivalent to make the change of variables

∆x. This property can be used to evaluate the integrals easier. Speciﬁcally, the piece of Fig. 11 lying
u = x
a1 + a2, can be traslated to the origin by using ∆x = a1; and the piece of this ﬁgure
in the interval a1 < x
≤
lying at a1 + a2 < x
a1 + a2 + a3 can be also traslated to the origin with ∆x = a1 + a2. On the other hand,
though the quantities IY and xCM are not invariant under such traslations, the same change of variables
simpliﬁes their calculations. This strategy is very useful in solids or surfaces that can be decomposed by
pieces (i.e. when at least one of the generator functions is deﬁned by pieces). For example, the same change
of variables could be used if we are interested in the solid of revolution generated by the surface of Fig. 11.

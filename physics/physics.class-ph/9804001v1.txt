CAN MECHANICALLY EXTENDED SOURCES OF RADIATION
IN CLASSICAL ELECTRODYNAMICS SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS
OF RADIATING POINT-LIKE SOURCES?

On simple example is shown that a model of mechanically extended source
of radiation in classical electrodynamics indeed has some problems with radi-
ation reaction force. So one cannot, in general case, state, that the present
situation with classical dynamics of mechanically extended sources of radia-
tion is ”very satisfactory”.

03.50.De

In classical electrodynamics there are known problems of radiation reac-
tion force for point-like sources of radiation: preacceleration, runaway and
other pathological (unphysical) solutions.

In the literature one can ﬁnd the opinion that if the ﬁnite size of a radi-
ating source is fully taken into account all the above problems can be solved.
In this paper we examine the well known model of ”nonrelativistically
rigid charged sphere” to show that nevertheless there remain problems with
radiation reaction force.

It should be mentioned that ”extended (mechanically) electron models”
were proposed long time ago in the works of Abraham, Lorentz, Sommerfeld
and others ( for good reviews see, for ex., [1,2,3,4]).

Thus in Sommerfeld works [5] was derived the expression of self-force
acting on ”nonrelativistically rigid charged sphere”, i.e sphere with radius
a, its center moving along trajectory ~R(t), with total charge Q and charge
density (in laboratory reference frame)

.

ρ(t, ~r) =

For our purpose it will be convenient to use for self-force

~Fself =

~E + [~v, ~H]/c

and t1 is the solution of the equation (equation of retardation):

t1 = t − [a2 + 2axL1 + (L1)2]1/2/c − a/c,

After integration by parts, expression (1) can be put in the form

With (2) equation of shell motion is

(3)

here m is the total mass of the shell, Fext - some external force.

Let us mention some features of the eq.(3).
1). If Fext = 0, then eq. (3) has the trivial solution

v = v0 = const

because the expression (1,2) for the self-force identically vanishes.

2). But this solution is not unique. An example of so called radiationless
motion of a rigid sphere was given in [6]. Now we consider solution of (3)
with Fext = 0 in the form of small perturbation of uniform motion:

v = v0 + cu(t),

|cu(t)| ≪ |v0|

(4)

and assume at ﬁrst that v0 6= 0 and v0 6= c.

Then, after linearization, homogeneous eq.(3) reads:

Since q < 0, we can state that the explicit solution v = v0 (v0 6= 0, c) of the
homogeneous eq.(3) is unstable.

Thus our sphere self-accelerates. What will be the result of this acceler-

ation?

If solutions v0 = 0, v0 = c both are stable, then there are two possible ways

of shell evolution: with damping (v → 0) and with anti-damping (v → c).

For analysis of stability of the solution v0 = 0 we examine the initial stage
of shell acceleration from the uniform motion v = v0 , when one can consider
that in the self-force (1) all retarded quantities do not feel yet the beginning
of the acceleration (this stage was beyond the analysis made in (4-8)).

That is, we put in (1) :

v(t′) = 0 = v(t1), L′ = R(t) − R0 − v0 · t = L1 ≡ ξ ≪ a.

Then the self-force (1) is calculated explicitly and in linear approximation
reads (v0 6= c):

F = B1 · ξ − B2 · ˙ξ

Thus eq.(3) takes the form

¨ξ + κ ˙ξ − δξ = 0

(9)

with κ = B2/(mγ3

0) ≥ 0, δ = B1/(mγ3

0) ≥ 0. It has solution

ξ ∼ exp (pt), p1,2 = −κ/2 ±

κ2/4 + δ

q

with runaway component p1 > 0 (for δ 6= 0). So there is instability (men-
tioned above).

But if v0 = 0, then δ = 0 and so solution v0 = 0 is stable.
Now turn to the solution v0 → c.
With L = R(t) − R0 − c · t ≡ ǫ (ǫ is small enough and positive), self-force

(1) in linear approximation is:

Q2
6a3 ǫ + O(ǫ2, ˙ǫ, ˙ǫ ln | ˙ǫ|)

Thus eq. (3) takes the form

m¨ǫ
(−2 ˙ǫ/c)3/2 =

Q2
6a3 ǫ + O(ǫ2, ˙ǫ, ˙ǫ ln | ˙ǫ|)

(10)

All solutions of (10) (under the taken assumptions that |ǫ| ≫ | ˙ǫ| and ǫ > 0 )
have the behavior

ǫ ∼ t−1/3 → 0,

(t → ∞)

So the asymptotic solution v0 = c is also stable.
Thus the evolution of the shell depends on the initial value of the velocity,
and if it is big enough, there can exist the antidamping eﬀect (contrary to
the opinion one can ﬁnd in the literature).

3). There is one more problem, actual to all intergal equations. If the
small perturbation u(t) is zero for t < 0, then the Laplace transformation of
(5) yields the following equation for eigenvalues λ:

λ =

Equation (9) after substitution λ = −q turns into eq. (6).
Thus at least for |λ| ≪ 1 eq. (9) is solvable and its solutions do not diﬀer

from solution (8) with λ = −q.

Then, as the theory of intergal equations tells, not for all forms of external
forces the solution in the form of (4) of the inhomogeneous equation (3) with
Fext 6= 0 exists!

The similar situation occurs for rotating shell - see [8].
Thus our conclusion is:
a model of mechanically extended source of radiation in classical electro-
dynamics with retardation indeed possesses some problems with radiation
reaction force.

So one cannot, in general, state, that the present situation with classical
dynamics of mechanically extended sources of radiation is ”very satisfactory”.
And to solve problems of radiation reaction force one must search for new

ideas and approaches.

The canonical problem of a perfect lens with linear bianisotropic mater-
ials is formulated. Its solution is shown to be directly connected with the
concept of nihility, the electromagnetic nilpotent. Perfect lenses as well as
nihility remain unrealizable.

KEYWORDS: Anti–vacuum, Lens, Negative permeability, Negative

permittivity, Nihility, Perfect lens

1 Introduction

This communication has been inspired by a report on the theory of a perfect
lens by Pendry [1]. This lens is supposedly constructed of a material whose per-
mittivity and permeability, respectively, are exactly negative of the permittivity
and the permeability of free space. In a predecessor paper [2], that material was
postulated as the anti–vacuum.

2 Canonical Formulation for a Lens

As geometrical optics is applicable for lenses, the canonical formulation for a lens
merely involves a linear homogeneous material conﬁned to the region between two
parallel planes. Let us, however, generalize the situation in order to understand
the issue at greater depth by involving two linear homogeneous materials and
four interfaces, as shown in Figure 1. The regions 0 ≤ z ≤ d1 and d1 + d2 ≤ z ≤
d1 + d2 + d3 are occupied by a material labelled a, and the region d1 ≤ z ≤ d1 + d2
by a material labelled b. Both materials are linear, homogeneous, bianisotropic

and necessarily dispersive, their frequency–domain constitutive relations being as
follows:

D(x, y, z, ω) = ǫ0

ǫa,b(ω) • E (x, y, z, ω) + αa,b(ω) • H (x, y, z, ω)

B(x, y, z, ω) = µ0

(cid:3)
βa,b(ω) • E (x, y, z, ω) + µa,b(ω) • H (x, y, z, ω)

In these relations, the dielectric properties are delineated by ǫa,b(ω), the magnetic
properties by µa,b(ω), and the magnetoelectric properties by αa,b(ω) as well as
βa,b(ω), all of these dyadics being functions of the angular frequency ω. The
permittivity and permeability of free space (i.e., vacuum) are denoted by ǫ0 and
µ0, respectively.

Without loss of essential generality, we can take the spatial Fourier transfor-

mations of all electromagnetic phasors with respect to x and y; thus,

E(x, y, z, ω) = e(z, κ, ψ, ω) exp [iκ(x cos ψ + y sin ψ)] ,

etc., suﬃce for the present purposes. Wave propagation in the two materials can
then be cast in terms of 4×4 matrix ordinary diﬀerential equations as follows [3]:

[f (z, κ, ψ, ω)] = i[P

Here, [f ] ≡ [ex; ey; hx; hy]T is a column 4–vector with the superscript T denoting
a,b] are 4×4 matrixes. Accordingly, we obtain the basic
the transpose, while [P

[f(d1 + d2 + d3, κ, ψ, ω)] = [M (d1 + d2 + d3, κ, ψ, ω)] • [f (0, κ, ψ, ω)] ,

Within the conﬁnes of continuum electromagnetics, the canonical lens problem
involves ﬁnding the material b and the thickness d2 for a speciﬁed material a and
thicknesses d1 and d3, such that

[M (d1 + d2 + d3, κ, ψ, ω)] = 

3 Analysis and Discussion

Obviously, that would be a fruitless endeavor in practice. Hence, lens designers
eﬀectively settle for some acceptable ranges of κ, ψ and ω in which (6) holds,
when material a is air. Deviations from an ideal match introduce aberrations [4].
Mathematically, and at ﬁrst glance, an excellent candidate for ideal match is

the following:

ǫb(ω) = −ǫa(ω) ,
βb(ω) = −βa(ω) ,
d2 = d1 + d3

αb(ω) = −αa(ω)
µb(ω) = −µa(ω)

Close inspection of (6), however, shows that (7) is suitable for all κ, only if
material a has orthorhombic symmetry, i.e.,

(8)

A sandwich of equal thicknesses of materials a and b then constitutes a planar
realization of a medium named nihility earlier in this journal [2]. Nihility is the
postulated electromagnetic nilpotent, with the following constitutive relations:

D(x, y, z, ω) = 0

B(x, y, z, ω) = 0 )

.

(9)

Wave propagation cannot occur in nihility, because ∇ × E(x, y, z, ω) = 0 and
∇×H(x, y, z, ω) = 0 in the absence of sources therein. Whereas the phase velocity
and the wavevector of a plane wave in vacuum/anti–vacuum are co–parallel/anti–
parallel, the directionality of the phase velocity relative to the wavevector in
nihility is a non–issue.

Physically, (7) and (8) are still deﬁcient because the principle of energy con-
servation has not been considered. With the normal constraint that material a be
passive, it follows from (7) that material b has to be active. Although their elec-
tromagnetic response can be simulated via composites containing active circuit
elements [5], I do not think that active materials will provide a realistic option in
the near future. Therefore, the passivity constraint on material b would lead to
aberrations due to absorption. To those must be added chromatic aberrations,
which would arise from the non–fulﬁlment of (7) outside some limited range of ω.
Suppose next that material a is isotropic and non–magnetoelectric, i.e., ǫa =
ǫa I, µa = µa I, and αa = βa = 0, where I is the identity dyadic and 0 is the null
dyadic. Then, a reasonable match in some frequency range could conceivably be
provided by materials that supposedly possess a negative index of refraction [6],
so long as absorption is acceptably low.

Pendry [1] actually took material a to be air, which is optically indistinguish-
able from vacuum (ǫa = I, µa = I, and αa = βa = 0) for most purposes. Thus,
the requirements on material b became very simple, viz., ǫb = −I, µb = −I, and
αb = βb = 0. (In other words, material b has to be anti–vacuum.) But Ziolkowski

[7] has recently concluded from two–dimensional computer simulations that even
these simple requirements (in some narrow frequency range) cannot be met by
realistic meta–materials. Recent correspondence between Pendry and others adds
to the debate [8]–[11].

A perfect lens remains unrealizable in my opinion, as does nihility.

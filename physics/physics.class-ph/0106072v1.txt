Abstract

The mechanisms leading to a seemingly superluminal propagation of light in
dispersive media are examined. The anomalous dispersion near an absorp-
tion line, involved in the ﬁrst experiments displaying negative group velocity
propagation, is shown to be not only simpler but also more eﬃcient than the
so-called transparent dispersion used in the later experiments of Wang et al.
(Nature (London) 406, 277 (2000)) and of Dogariu et al. (Phys.Rev.A 63,
053806 (2001)). The modest pulse advances observed by these authors can in
particular be reproduced with a better overall transmittance of the medium
and the signiﬁcant advances attained with a single-line arrangement would
probably be unattainable with their gain-doublet arrangement.

Much ado was made about the late experimental evidence of superluminal propagation
of light-pulses in an amplifying medium [1,2]. The repeated statement that ”the peak of
the pulse exits the cell before it even enters” [1,2] is in part responsible for the hazardous
speculations on ”superluminality” that appeared in the press. This excitement should not
however hide the fact that the pulse advances reported by Wang et al. [1] and by Dogariu
et al. [2] are modest (a few percent of the pulse width). More signiﬁcant advances have
been observed a long time ago by Chu and Wong [3] and by S´egard and Macke [4] in
experiments exploiting the very large anomalous dispersion occurring near an absorption
line. Astonishingly enough, Dogariu et al. hastily discard these experiments under the
pretext that, due to the absorption, they ”resulted in controversies over the interpretations”
[1,2] and even that the phenomenon was ”poorly understood” [2] ! We are not aware of
the controversies alluded to by Dogariu et al. and everybody can appreciate the degree of
physical understanding of the authors of Ref. [3] and Ref. [4] by examining the corresponding
papers. As shown hereafter, the physics underlying their experiments and those of Dogariu
et al. is in fact the same but the dispersion mechanism is more eﬃcient in the former that in
the latter. Consequently the pulse advances observed by Dogariu et al. in a medium which is
globally absorbing (transmittance 40%) can be reproduced with a better transmittance and
the signiﬁcant pulse advances obtained in Ref. [3] and Ref. [4] would be probably impossible
to attain with their gain-doublet arrangement.

Both kinds of experiments discussed here involve negative group velocities. Garrett and
McCumber [5] have been the ﬁrst to recognise that, under suitable conditions, pulses of light
can actually propagate at such velocities. A bell-shaped pulse then travels in the medium
without signiﬁcant alteration in such a manner that the peak of the pulse exits the medium
while the signal is still increasing at its entrance. It is worth emphasising that this does not
imply any breaking of the causality principle [5–7] since ”the t < 0 envelope maximum seen
by an observer at z > 0 is not a direct reﬂection of the maximum of the input-pulse envelope,
but arises from the action of the dispersive medium on the weak early components of that
envelope” [5]. From a spectral point of view, the phenomenon exclusively results from an
interference between the diﬀerent frequency components of the pulse in an anomalous disper-
sion region and not from a more or less selective ampliﬁcation or absorption in the medium,
as stated in Ref. [1]. Variations in the transmittance of the medium with frequency have in
fact detrimental eﬀects : by privileging some frequency components, they result in dramatic
distortions of the pulse and/or changes of its mean frequency, which increase rapidly with
propagation distance. Unfortunately, the large anomalous dispersions required to attain
signiﬁcant eﬀects are always associated with rapid variations in the transmittance of the
medium with frequency. The best results are expected to be obtained when there exists a
particular frequency for which the transmittance and the (negative) group velocity are simul-
taneously extremum, that is nearly constant in the vicinity of this frequency. This condition
is fulﬁlled in both kinds of experiments underdiscussion [1–4]. The working frequencies are
indeed close to a minimum of transmittance, respectively a maximum of absorption [3,4] or
a minimum of gain [1,2], coinciding with an extremum of the group velocity.

Explicit expressions of the advance of the pulse and of its distortion are conveniently de-
rived from the transfer function which links the Fourier transforms of the complex envelopes
of the input and output ﬁelds. By using the retarded time t′ (t′ = t
z/c in a dilute sample),
this transfer function may be written H(u) = exp [G(u)] where G(u) is the complex gain and

gain and the relaxation rate of (or corresponding to) the ith line. Gi = giL/2, where gi is the
intensity gain coeﬃcient on resonance (negative for an absorption line) and L is the medium
thickness. Eq.1 is obtained by assuming that the pulse bandwidth and all δi and γi are small
with respect to ω0 and that all gi are small compared to the wavenumber ω0/c (slowly varing
amplitude and phase approximation). Note that the poles (singularities) of Γ(p) and then
of the transfer function H(p) with p = iu are located in the left part of the complex plane.

This ensures that the impulse response h(t′) =
null for t′ < 0 and, t′ indicating here the retarded time, that superluminal propagation of

information is forbidden [6,7]. A general study of the systems described by Eq. 1 will be
presented in a forthcoming paper. The analysis is here restricted to the cases where the
anomalous dispersion originates either from a single absorption line as in the experiments of
Chu and Wong [3] and of S´egard and Macke [4] or from a doublet of two identical amplifying
lines as in the experiments of Dogariu et al. [1,2]. The detunings δi are chosen such that
the real and imaginary parts of the complex gain are respectively even and odd functions of
u = (ω
ω0). This warrantees that the medium transmittance and the group velocity will
be both extremum for ω = ω0 and is achieved for δ1 = 0 in the single-line case (n = 1) and
for δ1 =
δ2 in the gain-doublet case (n = 2). The complex gains, respectively Γ1 and Γ2,
take then the simple forms given below.

Hn(0) and an being real [8] for n = 1 or 2, the eﬀect of the medium on the complex
envelope of the pulse is to change its amplitude by the factor Hn(0) and to shift it in time
by an. The time-shift is easily identiﬁed with the advance of the pulse having propagated
in the medium at the group velocity on the same pulse having covered the same distance
in vacuum. a2 is positive (true advance) only if ∆ > 1 and attains its maximum value
G/4γ for ∆ = √3. As indicated before, the amplitude transmittance of the medium

and a relative minimum
It is an absolute minimum for
when a2 > 0 (see Fig.5 of Ref. [2]). The essential point
between two maximums for
is that the larger are the aimed advances the more the transmittances depart from unity,
downwards in the single-line case and upwards in the gain-doublet case (see Eq.5 and Eq.7).
It is thus impossible to obtain advances without change of the pulse amplitude, unless one
associates ampliﬁcation and absorption. This has been simply achieved in the experiments
[1–4] by compensating the absorption (resp. the ampliﬁcation) by a suitable broadband,
i.e. non-dispersive, ampliﬁcation (resp. absorption). The device achieving the required
ampliﬁcation (resp. absorption) should be considered as an integral part of the systems
under investigation (denoted S1 and S2 in the following). Absorption and ampliﬁcation
appear then to be tightly coupled in both kinds of experiments which, from this point of
view, only diﬀer by the implementation of the dispersion, associated either to the absorption
stage [3,4] or to the ampliﬁcation stage [1,2].

The pulse advances should naturally be referred to the pulse duration τp (hereafter the
half-width at 1/e of the amplitude proﬁle) and the relative merits of the systems S1 and S2
are suitably evaluated by comparing the pulse distortion they generate for the same value
of the relative advance A = a/τp, where a indicates a1 or a2. This distortion can be derived
from the exact form of the transfer functions of the above-deﬁned global systems S1 and S2.
The transfer function H ′
1 of S1 can be expressed in terms of the dimensionless quantities A,
Z and Ω = (ω

ω0)τp. One gets:

with A = Z/γτp. The equivalent expression of the transfer function H ′
2(Ω) of S2 is somewhat
complicated in the general case but only its particular form for ∆ = √3 (leading to the
maximum advance) is needed for the following discussion. It reads :

. The corresponding impulse response h′
2(θ) with θ = t′/τp are then proportional
1(θ) and h′
to the Dirac function δ(θ) and this means that the propagation of temporally localised
features (involving high frequency components) is luminal. Advances are obtained in the
opposite limit Ω
0 and the distortion of the pulse envelope, if it is not too large, mainly
originates from the second order term in the expansion of the complex gain in powers of Ω.
The transfer functions H ′

2(Ω) can then be written under the common form.

where E(L, θ) and E(0, θ) are respectively the complex envelopes of the output and input
pulses and where ε indicates ε1 or ε2. The last term of Eq.11 is obviously responsible for
the pulse distortion which, for a given pulse shape, is fully characterised by the parameter
ε. Although superluminal propagation is not speciﬁc to gaussian pulses [9], these pulses are

suitable for simple calculations [1–5,9]. Putting E(0, θ) = exp(
shown that the alteration of the pulse simply consists of a magniﬁcation of the amplitude
proﬁle by the factor β = (1 + ε) and its narrowing by the same factor, in agreement with the
area theorem for the ﬁeld envelope [10]. The intensity proﬁle is also narrowed by the factor β
but magniﬁed by the factor β2. The narrowing is in particular responsible for the diﬀerence
between the advances a↓ and a↑ on the fall and the rise of the pulse. Such a diﬀerence is
particularly apparent on Fig.6 of Ref. [2]. Dogariu et al. claim that ”the front edges and the
trailing edges of the pulse are shifted forward by the same amount”. A simple inspection
of the insets in their ﬁgure shows on the contrary that a↓ and a↑ are dramatically diﬀerent,
1
roughly in the proportion of 3 to 2. Quite generally, a↓ = a+τa(1
β ),
where τa indicates the half-width of the pulse at the amplitude or intensity used to determine
a↓ and a↑. The diﬀerence (a↓ - a↑) is suitably characterised by the ”contrast” ξ :

The parameter ξ has the advantage of referring the distortion to the relative advance.

Since the pulse advances observed with the gain-doublet arrangement [1,2] are one or-
der of magnitude smaller than those attained with the single-line scheme [3,4], the direct
comparison of the absolute distortions is meaningless. These distortions indeed increase as
the square of the advances. It is obviously more relevant to examine the potentialities of
each experiment for a same pulse advance and a same level of distortion (A and ε given)
or, more precisely, to determine in what conditions each system would be able to reproduce
the results obtained with the other. This is easily achieved by remarking that, A being
ﬁxed, the same level of distortion is attained in both arrangements when Z = G/4 (see the
expressions of ε).

In the experiment of Dogariu et al. [2], G, a and the full width at half maximum of
the intensity proﬁle of the pulse are respectively 0.7, 63 ns and 2.4 µs. This leads to τp =
2.04µs (half-width at 1/e of the corresponding amplitude proﬁle, assumed to be gaussian),
A = 0.031 and ε = 0.011. The value ∆ = √3, used to establish the relation ε = 8A2/G,
is consistent with the contrast ξ deduced from Fig.6 of Ref. [2] (ξ
0.2) and with the
separation of the two maximums of gain shown in Fig.5. The same relative advance and
distortion would be obtained in the single-line case with an optical thickness Z = G/4 and
0.7. It is amazing to note
the intensity transmittance of the medium would be exp(
that the transmittance of this ”absorbing” medium is better than that of the ”transparent”
medium used by Dogariu et al. (only 0.4, due to the presence of reverse-pumped atoms).

On an other hand one may wonder whether it would be possible to observe the large
advances attained in the single-line case [3,4] with a gain-doublet arrangement. For the sake
of deﬁniteness, the data of the Fig.2 of Ref. [4] are considered. Z, a and the half-width at
half-maximum of the amplitude proﬁle of the pulse are respectively 5.25, 2 µs and 4 µs.
This leads to τp = 4.8µs, A = 0.42, ε = 0.067 and ξ = 0.13. The extended system S1 under
consideration consists of the medium of amplitude transmittance e−Z and an ampliﬁer of
ampliﬁcation factor eZ (
46dB). Assuming again ∆ = √3, the same relative advance and
distortion would be obtained in the gain-doublet case with G = 4Z = 21. The maximum of
Re(Γ2) is G/(4√3
1.08G whereas its minimum (at Ω = 0) is G/2. The maximum of
the ﬁeld ampliﬁcation factor of the global system S2 would then be e0.58G
2.105 (106dB).
Even if it would be feasible (?) a system having such an optical gain at some frequency
would be unstable.
It is obviously possible to reduce the optical gain by a broadband
absorber overcompensating the gain at Ω = 0 and to use a post-ampliﬁer (as it is actually
done in the experiments of Dogariu et al.). However the ampliﬁcation factor of the required
post-ampliﬁer would be considerably larger than that of the ampliﬁer used in the single-line
arrangement and this could raise serious problem of signal to noise ratio.

In conclusion, the propagation of light pulses at a negative group velocity in a medium
whose dispersion originates from a single absorption line is a phenomenon which has been
well understood for a long time and now pertains to classical physics [11]. The physics
underlying the experiments where the dispersion results from a doublet of two amplifying
lines is quite similar. Indeed both kinds of experiments involve tightly coupled ampliﬁcation
and absorption and, in principle, only diﬀer by the stage where the dispersion is implemented.
However, the single-line arrangement appears, in practice, to be more eﬃcient that the
gain-doublet scheme. A study of other arrangements is in progress.
It appears possible
in particular to cancel the second order distortion (prevailing in the experiments discussed
above) by using a doublet of absorption lines. In all cases, obtaining signiﬁcant advances
with moderate distortion requires the association of very large ampliﬁcation and absorption.
Otherwise said, Mother Nature resists to any transgression of her laws, even when this
trangression is only apparent as in the experiments of superluminal propagation.

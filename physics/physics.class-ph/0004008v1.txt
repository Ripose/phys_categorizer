Abstract

We introduce the magnetic angular momentum as a consequence of the struc-

ture of the sO(3) Lie algebra deﬁned by the Feynman brackets. The Poincar´e

momentum and Dirac magnetic monopole appears as a direct result of this

framework.

I. INTRODUCTION

In 1990, Dyson [1] published a proof due to Feynman of the Maxwell equations, assuming

only commutation relations between position and velocity. In this article we don’t use the

commutation relations explicitly. In fact what we call a commutation law is a structure of

algebra between position and velocity called in this letter Feynman’s brackets. With this

minimal assumption Feynman never supposed the existence of an Hamiltonian or Lagrangian

1

formalism and didn’t need the not gauge invariant momentum. Tanimura [2] extended

Feynman’s derivation to the case of the relativistic particle.

In this letter one concentrates only on the following point: the study of a nonrelativistic

particle using Feynman brackets. We show that Poincare’s magnetic angular momentum is

the consequence of the structure of the sO(3) Lie algebra deﬁned by Feynman’s brackets.

II. FEYNMAN BRACKETS

Assume a particle of mass m moving in a three dimensional Euclidean space with position:

xi(t) (i = 1, 2, 3) depending on time. As Feynman we consider a non associative internal

structure (Feynman brackets) between the position and the velocity. The starting point is

the bracket between the various components of the coordinate:

[xi, xj] = 0

(1)

We suppose that the brackets have the same properties than in Tanimura’s article [2], that

is:

[A, B] = −[A, B]

[A, BC] = [A, B]C + [A, C]B

[A, B] = [

.
A, B] + [A,

.
B]

d
dt

where the arguments A, B and C are the positions or the velocities.

The following Jacobi identity between positions is also trivially satisﬁed:

[xi, [xj, xk]] + [xj, [xk, xi]] + [xk, [xi, xj]] = 0

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

In addition we will need also a “Jacobi identity” mixing position and velocity such that:

.
[
xi, [

.
xj, xk]] + [

.
xj, [xk,

.
xi]] + [xk, [

.
xi,

.
xj]] = 0

(6)

Deriving (1) gives:

This implies:

.
[
xi, xj] + [xi,

.
xj] = 0

[xi,

.
xj] = gij(xk),

where gij(xk) is a symmetric tensor. We consider here only the case where:

gij =

δij
m

this gives the following relations:

[xi, f (xj)] = 0

[xi, f (xj,

.
xj)] =

1
m

∂f (
∂

.
xj)
.

.
[
xi, f (xj)] = −

∂f (xj)

∂xi

III. ANGULAR MOMENTUM

Suppose ﬁrst the following relation:

.
[
xi,

.
xj] = 0

which permits to say that the force law is velocity independent:

..
xi=

..
xi (xj)

By deﬁnition the orbital angular momentum is:

Li = mεijkxj

.
xk

which satisﬁes the standard sO(3) Lie algebra for Feynman’s brackets:

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

[Li,Lj] = εijkLk

The transformation law of the position and velocity under this symmetry is:

[xi,Lj] = εijkxk

.
[
xi, Lj] = εijk

.
xk

We consider as Feynman [1], the case with a ”gauge curvature”:

.
[
xi,

.
xj] =

α
m2 Fij

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

where F must be an antisymmetric tensor (electromagnetic tensor for our example) and α

a constant. The goal of our work is to see what happens if we keep the structure of the Lie

algebra of the angular momentum and the transformation law of the position and velocity.

Using (6) we get the relations:

α

∂Fjk
.
xi
∂

.
xj

.

, xk]]

= −m2[

.
xj, [xi,

.
xk]] + [

.
xk, [

.
xj, xi]] = 0

then the electromagnetic tensor is independent of the velocity:

By deriving (8) we have:

then:

or:

Fjk = Fjk(xi)

[xi,

..
xj] = −[

.
xi,

.
xj] = −

m

..
xi= α(Ei(xk) + Fij(xk)

.
xj)

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

We get the ” Lorentz force’s law”, where the electric ﬁeld appears as a constant of integration

(this is not the case for the relativistic problem, see [2]). Now the force law is velocity

dependent:

..
xi=

..
xi (xj,

.
xj)

For the case (19), the equations (16), (17)and (18) become :

[xi,Lj] = εijkxk

.
[
xi, Lj] = εijk

.
xk +αεjklxk

Fil
m

[Li,Lj] = εijkLk + αεiklεjmsxkxmFls

Introducing the magnetic ﬁeld we write F in the following form:

Fij = εijkBk,

We get then the new relations:

.
[
xi, Lj] = εijk

.
xk +

{xiB − δij(

→
r .

→
B)}

α
m

[Li,Lj] = εijk{Lk + αxk(

→
r .

→
B)}

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

To keep the standard relations we introduce a generalized angular momentum:

Li = Li + Mi

We call Mi the magnetic angular momentum because it depends on the ﬁeld

(32)

→
B.

It has

no connection with the spin of the particle, which can be introduced by looking at the

spinorial representations of the sO(3) algebra. Now we impose for the {αj}’s the following

commutation relations:

.
[
xi, L|] = εi|k§k

5

(33)

.
[
xi, L|] = εi|k

.
§k

[Li,L|] = εi|kLk

Mi = Mi(xj)

This ﬁrst relation gives:

and the second:

.
[
xi, Mj] =

α
m

[δij(

→
r .

→
B) − xiBj]

If we replace it in (35) we deduce:

Mi = −α(

→
r .

→
B)xi

Putting this result in (34) gives the following equation of constraint for the ﬁeld

−→
B :

xiBj + xjBi = −xj xk

∂Bk
∂xi

One solution has the form of a radial vector ﬁeld centered at the origin:

→
B= β

→
r
r3

The generalized angular momentum then becomes:

→
L= m(

→
r ∧

.
→
r ) − α(

→
r .

→
B)

→
r

We can check the conservation of the total angular momentum:

→
d
L
dt

= m(

→
r ∧

..
→
r ) − α{

→
r ∧(

.−→r ∧

−→
B )} = 0

because the particle satisﬁes the usual equation of motion:

..
→
r

d2
dt2 = α(

m

.
→
r ∧

If we choose: α = q and β = g, where q and g are the electric and magnetic charges, we

obtain as a the special case the Poincar´e [3] magnetic angular momentum:

and the Dirac [4] magnetic monopole:

→
M = −

→
r

r

qg
4π

→
B=

r3

g

(44)

(45)

In addition we ﬁnd that for the Dirac monopole the source of the ﬁeld is localized at the

origin:

div

−→
B = [

.
xi, [

.
xj,

.
xk]] + [

.
xj, [

.
xk,

.
xi]] + [

.
xk, [

.
xi,

.
xj]] =

g
4π

.
[
xi,

xi
r3 ] = gδ(

→
r )

(46)

We see that in the construction of the Feynman’s brackets algebra the fact that we didn’t im-

pose the Jacobi identity between the velocities is a necessary condition to obtain a monopole

solution.

In summary, we used the Feynman’s algebra between position and velocity to compute

the algebra of the angular momentum of a non relativistic particle in a electromagnetic

ﬁeld. The Dirac monopole and magnetic angular momentum is a direct consequence of the

conservation of the form of the standard sO(3) Lie algebra.

IV. CASIMIR OPERATOR

In the same spirit, it is interesting to introduce L2, the Casimir operator of sO(3) Lie alge-

bra. Again we want to keep the same commutation relations in the two cases corresponding

to zero and non zero curvature.

In the ﬁrst case, we easily see that:

[xi,L2] = 2(

→
L ∧

→
r )i

.
xi, L2] = 2(
[

→
L ∧

.
→
r )i

7

(47)

(48)

and in presence of a curvature:

[Li,L2] = 0

[xi,L2] = 2(

→
L ∧

→
r )i

.
xi, L2] = 2[(
[

→
L ∧

.
→
r )i + α(

→
L ∧

→
r )lFil]

[Li,L2] = 2α(

→
L ∧

→
r )i(

→
r .

→
B)

then we want:

and we can deduce:

[xi,L∈] = ∈(

→
L ∧

→
∇)i

.

xi, L∈] = ∈(
[

→
L ∧

.
→
∇)i

[Li,L∈] = ′

[xi,M 2] = 2(

→
M ∧

→
r )i

.
xi, M 2] = 2[(
[

→
M ∧

→
r )i − α(

→
L ∧

→
r )lFil

2α(

→
L ∧

→
r )i(

→
r .

→
B) + [Li, M 2] + [Mi,L2] = 0

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

(58)

The last equation becomes after a straightforward computation:

→
M ∧

(

→
r )(

→
L ∧

.
→
r ) − (

→
L ∧

→
r )(

→
M ∧

.
→
r ) − (

→
M ∧

.
→
r )(

→
L ∧

→
r ) + (

→
M ∧

→
r )(

→
L ∧

.
→
r ) = 0

(59)

We can check that this equation of constraint is in particular satisﬁed for the Poincar´e

angular momentum.

V. CONCLUSION

We ﬁnd that the structure of Feynman’s brackets (without an Hamiltonian or La-

grangian), illuminates the connections between the spaces with gauge curvature, the sO(3)

Lie algebra and the existence of the Poincar´e magnetic angular momentum. It seems that

more than the phase space formalism, the Feynman’s one is a good approach of the me-

chanics in a space with gauge symmetry, because it avoids the introduction of the not gauge

invariant momentum. Further, other applications of this method, for example, the case of

the Minkowski space with Lorentz Lie algebra, will be consider in the future.

(December 29, 1998. Revised: February 1999)

In the previous paper we proved that the Evans-Vigier deﬁnitions of B(0)
and B(3) may be related not with magnetic ﬁelds but with a 4-vector ﬁeld. In
the present Addendum it is shown that the terms used in the B
Cyclic theo-
rem proposed by M. Evans and J.-P. Vigier may have various transformation
properties with respect to Lorentz transformations. The fact whether the B(3)
ﬁeld is a part of a bi-vector (which is equivalent to antisymmetric second-rank
tensor) or a part of a 4-vector, depends on the phase factors in the deﬁnition
of positive- and negative- frequency solutions of the (B, E) transverse ﬁeld.
This is closely connected to our considerations of the Bargmann-Wightman-
Wigner (Gelfand-Tsetlin-Sokolik) Constructs and with the Ahluwalia’s recent
consideration of the phase factor related to gravity. The physical relevance of
proposed constructs is discussed.

for instance,

This theory got great deal of criticism, see,
[3–8]. Particularly, Comay
claimed [6] that the B(3) ﬁeld is incompatible with the Relativity Theory.
I commented
this discussion in [2] and suggested that the B(3) ﬁeld may be interpreted as a part of 4-
vector ﬁeld functions, see also [9–11].
In the present paper I show that the question of
the transformation law for such a kind of the ﬁeld is not trivial and depends on the phase
factors between up- and down- parts of electromagnetic bi-vectors (or between parts of the
antisymmetric tensor which is equivalent to the former) corresponding to the positive- and
negative- frequency solutions. The achieved result is that the B(3) ﬁeld deﬁned as
in (2) may be a part of the antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld. In this case we encounter
unusual conﬁgurations of the corresponding transverse B and E, but similar unusual conﬁg-
urations of the antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld have been considered for a long time [12–18]; they
are very well-known to the quantum-ﬁeld theorists (information mainly from the referee and
editors of the paper [11] from Physical Review D); and a similar construct found its sound
interpretation in the recent Ahluwalia’s paper [19], who is perfectly aware about previous
considerations [13,16,17,14,12,1] (cf. references in [19]) and with whom we discussed all this
staﬀ during last six years.

I would like to pass now to mathematical details.
In refs. [1] the authors used the transverse solutions of the Maxwell’s equations (the
formula (1) above) in order to deﬁne B(3). These tranverse solutions can be re-written to
the real ﬁelds:

B
E

which represent the right-polarized radiation (B0 = E0). Of course, similar formulas exist
for left-polarized radiation.

The Lorentz transformation law for antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld (written in the form of

the bi-vector) is:

It is easy to see that the case considered in ref. [1,2] corresponds to the choice of the ﬁeld
function (operator in the quantized case) in the following form:

Phase factors in the formula (5) is ﬁxed between the vector and axial-vector parts of the
antisymemtric tensor ﬁeld for both positive- and negative- frequency solutions if one wants
to have pure real ﬁelds. The B(3) ﬁeld in this case may be regarded as a part of 4-vector
with respect to the Lorentz transformations.

In the present Addendum we are going to lift the above requirement and consider the

general case:

Then , we repeat the procedure of ref. [2] and ﬁnd out that the B(3) ﬁeld may have various
transformation laws when the transverse ﬁelds transform with the above matrix Λ. Since
the Evans-Vigier ﬁeld is deﬁned by the formula (2) we search the transformation law for the
cross product of the transverse modes

B(0) is a true scalar in such a case.

After D. V. Ahluwalia et al., ref. [14], and his commenters [12,11] (see also acknowl-
edgements in [15]) we learnt that the theory of antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld 1) admits the
parity doubling; 2) suggests various relativistic equations for its description and 3) the third
state of the ﬁeld which in the massless limit can vanish only under the certain choice of
normalization and frame of reference (the latter is valid when the instant form of relativistic
dynamics is used).

Finally, I would like to point out that the origins of such surprising features of the
antisymmetric tensor ﬁeld of the second rank (unknown until recently) may be 1) possible
composteness of the “photon”; 2) “hidden” electrodynamical non-locality (apart ref. [19]
see also [20]); 3) “a representation space carries more information than a [particular] wave
equation (e.g., Maxwell equations) – as noted also in the abstract of [19]; and 4) intrinsic
interlink between gravitational and electromagnetic ﬁelds – as noted by L. de Broglie and
G. Lochak (see [21]).

The question of experimental possibility of detection of the class of antisymmetric tensor
ﬁelds considered in the present Addendum (in fact, of the anti-hermitian modes on using the
terminology of the quantum optics) is still on schedule.

In conclusion, in my opinion, all the unpleasant incidents occured during the discussion of
the B(3) theory and related matters shows evidently serious failures of our scientiﬁc system.
Finally, I want to note that the topic of the B(3) ﬁeld (in all its contradictions) is already
well understood, in my opinion, and am not going to enter into these discussions any more.

the concept of the B(3) ﬁeld, while frequently do not agree with him in many particular
questions. But, as shown above the postulates of the B(3) theory may be viable.

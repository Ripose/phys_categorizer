Abstract. The problem of the self-interaction of a quasi-rigid classical particle with
an arbitrary spherically symmetric charge distribution is completely solved up to the
ﬁrst order in the acceleration. No ad hoc assumptions are made. The relativistic
equations of conservation of energy and momentum in a continuous medium are used.
The electromagnetic ﬁelds are calculated in the reference frame of instantaneous rest
using the Coulomb gauge; in this way the troublesome power expansion is avoided.
Most of the puzzles that this problem has aroused are due to the inertia of the
negative pressure that equilibrates the electrostatic repulsion inside the particle. The
eﬀective mass of this pressure is −Ue/(3c2), where Ue is the electrostatic energy. When
the pressure mass is taken into account the dressed mass m turns out to be the
bare mass plus the electrostatic mass m = m0 + Ue/c2.
It is shown that a proper
mechanical behaviour requires that m0 > Ue/(3c2). This condition poses a lower
bound on the radius that a particle of a given bare mass and charge may have. The
violation of this condition is the reason why the Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac formula for
the radiation reaction of a point charge predicts unphysical motions that run away
or violate causality. Provided the mass condition is met the solutions of the exact
equation of motion never run away and conform to causality and energy and momentum
conservation. When the radius is much smaller than the wave-length of the radiated
ﬁelds, but the mass condition is still met, the exact expression reduces to the formula
that Rohrlich [ Phys. Lett. A 303 307 (2002)] has advocated for the radiation reaction
of a quasi-point charge.

1. Introduction

Perhaps the last unsolved problem of classical physics is the self-interaction of charged
particles. We refer to a classical particle with a spherically symmetric charge density
moving under the inﬂuence of an external force Fex and the force Fem due to the
electromagnetic ﬁelds that it itself generates. This last self-force can be expressed as
the sum of the negative time derivative of the momentum of the local electromagnetic
ﬁelds that surround the particle (FL) plus the radiation reaction (FR). Fairly complete
relations of more than a century of history can be found in the monograph of Yaghjian
[1], in the review of Rohrlich [2] and in the chapter 16 of the textbook of Jackson [3].
The published solutions of this problem are plenty with puzzles. Let us consider the
most notorious ones. We will use Gauss units.

1)Spontaneous self-acceleration. The Lorentz-Abraham-Dirac (LAD) formula for
the radiation reaction of a point charge [4, 5, 6], which in the non-relativistic limit
reduces to FR = 2
3q2 ˙a/c3, has solutions in which the particle, in the absence of an
external force, spontaneously accelerates itself approaching speed c (run-away solutions).
2)Violation of causality. There are also solutions of the LAD equation that do not
run away, but where the acceleration depends on values that the applied force will take
in the future.

3)Power unbalance. The electrostatic ﬁeld (i. e. the electric ﬁeld that is present
when the particle is not accelerated) does not contribute to the net force on the particle,
because the integral over the volume of the corresponding force density vanishes. It,
nevertheless, contributes to the power, because of the Lorentz contraction. As a result
the total power of electromagnetic forces diﬀers from the product Fem · v. This was
noticed by Abraham in 1904 [7]. In 1905 Poincar´e [8, 9] showed that the existence of a
pressure was required in order to balance the electrostatic repulsion and thus assure the
stability of the particle. The work of the pressure as the volume of the particle changes,
[8] and in
was supposed to ﬁx the power unbalance. But there is a problem, in Ref.
[9] (p. 20) Poincar´e refers to an external pressure, whose
the introduction of Ref.
work is indeed proportional to the change of volume, but the pressure that is actually
calculated (p. 63 of Ref. [9]) is an internal negative pressure, whose work over the whole
particle is obviously zero. It is worth remarking that the results of Lorentz, Abraham
and Poincar´e on this subject conform with relativity in spite of being previous to the
1905 Einstein paper, because they assume an ad hoc Lorentz contraction.

4) The 4/3 problem. The electrostatic energy Ue should contribute to the mass of the
particle, so if m0 is the bare mass then the dressed mass must be m = m0 + Ue/c2. But
if one computes the momentum of the electromagnetic ﬁeld that surrounds a spherical
charge distribution moving with velocity v one obtains 4
3 Ueγv/c2. This value agrees with
that part of the self-force that is proportional to the acceleration (FL). To make matters
more confusing the energy of such ﬁeld is Ueγ(1 + 1
3 (v/c)2), which has an additional
1
3(v/c)2 term.

Schwinger [10] has shown, for a spherically symmetrical charge distribution moving

uniformly, that there are tensors which depend on the ﬁelds, that can be added to the
electromagnetic energy-momentum-stress tensor T µν in order to obtain a divergence-less
total tensor. He proposed that such “corrected” tensors should be used for calculating
the four-momentum of the ﬁelds. He found two possible tensors, corresponding to
electromagnetic masses Ue/c2 and 4
3Ue/c2. Rohrlich [2] has remarked that any value of
the electromagnetic mass in between is also possible.

5)Apparent violation of energy and momentum conservation. The Larmor [11]
formula for the radiated power by a point charge in the instantaneous rest frame is
Prad = 2
3q2a2/c3. But the LAD formula predicts that if the particle is moving with
constant acceleration the reaction force is zero and therefore also its power. From
where is the radiated power coming? A similar situation occurs with the momentum.
In the rest frame the rate of radiated momentum vanishes. Where does the impulse
of the radiation reaction force go? One should expect that the electromagnetic ﬁeld
surrounding the particle acts as a reservoir of energy and momentum.

The Classical Electromagnetism of a continuous current density jµ is a perfectly
well behaved theory that conserves energy and momentum and conforms to causality.
Solutions that run away or violate causality simply cannot appear. Various are the
sources of the problems.

The run-away solutions and the violations of causality should be attributed to the
R → 0 limit. We will show for any spherical charge distribution, that in order to avoid
run-away solutions the total eﬀective mass of the particle m must be greater than the
mass of the electromagnetic ﬁelds surrounding it, i. e. 4
3 Ue/c2. The reason is simple:
m − 4
3Ue/c2 is the eﬀective mass of matter, if it were negative the acceleration would be
opposite to the force. As Ue ≥ 1
2q2/R there is an absolute minimum for the radius of a
classical particle of mass m and charge q, R ≥ 2
3 q2/(mc2). Therefore the R → 0 limit is
unphysical, because R = 0 is interior to an unphysical region.

The violation of causality is due to the expansion in powers of R that is used to
evaluate the electromagnetic ﬁelds and the self-force. As the ﬁelds are linear functionals
of the retarded currents jµ, so must also be Fem. As this self-force vanishes if the particle
is not accelerated, it should be a functional of the retarded acceleration a(t − |x − y|/c),
where x and y are two points of the particle. We will ﬁnd such functional for an
arbitrary charge density. So, for the exact solution of an extended particle there are no
pre-accelerations or violations of causality. Of course if we make an expansion in powers
of |x − y| and we take any ﬁnite number of terms we get an instantaneous result which
violates causality. If we take the R → 0 limit we are left with the R−1 and the R0 terms,
the ﬁrst one diverges and corresponds to the local ﬁelds reaction FL, while the second
is the LAD result for the radiation reaction FR; as said above such limit is unphysical.
In the calculation of Dirac [6] the violation of causality is explicit, because the advance
Green’s function is used.

The exact self-force of a sphere of radius R with a uniformly charged surface has
been calculated by Sommerfeld [12], Page [13], Caldirola [14] and Yaghjian [1]. Their
result conﬁrm what we have been discussing [2, 15]. Our general result yields the

Radiation reaction of a classical quasi-rigid extended particle.

Sommerfeld-Page-Caldirola-Yaghjian formula for the charged spherical shell.

The power unbalance and the 4/3 problems have a common origin. They are due to
having overlooked a purely relativistic eﬀect: pressure has inertia. In our calculation we
use the relativistic momentum-energy conservation formula for a continuous medium.
Here the momentum-energy tensor of matter, the stress tensor and the force density
appear. We have to remark that this stress tensor is not some ad hoc addition, it is just
the stress tensor that any continuous medium should have. At rest the stress tensor is
determined by the electrostatic repulsion and is purely spatial, but when the particle
is moving the temporal components of the tensor do not vanish. Those components
contribute to the momentum density and to the energy density of the particle. By
integration over the volume one obtains the equation of motion and the energy equation.
The pressure contribution to the mass of the particle is − 1
3 Ue/c2 which is just what is
needed to ﬁx the 4/3 problem. The power unbalance also disappears.

Finally the apparent violation of energy and momentum conservations is understood
by considering all the contributions to the energy and momentum of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld that surrounds the particle. When the particle is not accelerated there is an
electromagnetic ﬁeld around the particle, the local ﬁeld, which contributes to the energy
and momentum of the particle. Call uL and SL its energy density and Poynting vector.
In addition to this, when the particle is accelerated there is also the radiated ﬁeld with
energy density uR and Poynting vector SR. But the energy density and the Poynting
vector are quadratic functions of the ﬁelds, so the total energy density and Poynting
vector have additional cross terms, S = SL + SR + SC and u = uL + uR + uC These
cross terms act as energy and momentum reservoirs.

The point charges (R = 0) are inconsistent with classical electrodynamics, but
phenomenologically a point charge is a body with a radius that is negligible as compared
to the other relevant distances, in particular to the wavelength of the ﬁelds with which it
interacts. We will call such particles physical point charges, while we call mathematical
point charges those with R = 0. We will show that the acceleration can be expressed as
a time integral of the retarded applied force. When the physical point charge conditions
are fulﬁlled the expression reduces to an equation similar to LAD motion equation, but
replacing ˙a by ˙Fex/m, exactly as was recently proposed by Rohrlich [16].

2. Quasi-rigid motion

A perfectly rigid body is inconsistent with relativity because it implies instantaneous
propagation of signals. In general if a body is accelerated it is stressed and deformed.
How this happens depends on the particular characteristics of the body and the applied
force. If the external force is more o less uniform through the body and the acceleration
is small and does not change too rapidly the body can, as seen in the instantaneous rest
frame, continuously maintain its shape suﬀering a negligible deformation compared with
particle radius. The bound on the acceleration a is easily determined. The speed change
during the time that a signal takes to traverse the particle should be negligible with

respect to the speed of sound (speed of signals in the particle). So, (2R/vs)a ≪ vs. For
a particle of maximum stiﬀness; vs = c and so a ≪ c2/(2R), which is an immense bound
even for macroscopic particles. The bound of the time derivative of the acceleration is
obtained by comparison of the relative rate of change of the acceleration with the inverse
of the transit time, ˙a/a ≪ vs/(2R). Again assuming maximum stiﬀness, ˙a/a ≪ c/(2R).
If both conditions are satisﬁed the motion of the particle is essentially rigid and the
internal degrees of freedom of the particle are not excited. We will assume that this is
the case. We are explicitly excluding eﬀects produced by deformation of the particle,
such as polarisation.

Consider a spherically symmetric particle. Let x0(t) be the position of the centre
of the particle in the laboratory reference frame. Let v0(t) and a0(t) be the velocity and
acceleration of that point. The instantaneous rest frame would be deﬁned by a Lorentz
transformation of velocity −v0 and “parallel” axes. Let y be the position relative to the
centre of an element of the particle in the rest frame. We will assume that the motion
of each element of the particle is given by the following expression

x(y, t) = x0(t) + y + (γ−1

0 − 1)(y · ˆv0)ˆv0,

accelerated (1) reproduces correctly the Lorentz contraction.

but in the rest reference frame all the points are at rest v(y, t) = 0. The accelerations in
diﬀerent points diﬀer even in the rest frame, but the diﬀerence in that case is negligible
a(y, t) = (1 − y · a0/c2)a0.

It is convenient to deﬁne δv as the diﬀerence between the velocity of a point and

the velocity of the centre

δv = v(y, t) − v0(t).

3. Extended particle equation

The dynamics of an extended particle is determined by the momentum-energy tensor
Θµν, the stress tensor P µν and the force density f µ with the equation [17]

∇µ(Θµν + P µν) = f ν.

For a spherically symmetric particle the proper density of rest mass µ(y), which
is a four-scalar, is a function of the radial y = |y| coordinate in the rest frame. The
integral of µ(y) over the proper volume is the bare rest mass of the particle m0. The
tensor Θµν is given by

Θµν = µuµuν,

where uµ is the four-velocity (ui = γvi,u0 = γc).

The stress tensor in the rest frame is symmetric and purely spatial, P 0ν = P ν0 = 0.
We are using the metric tensor gµν that has a positive trace. In general P 00 = vivjP ij/c2
and P 0i = P i0 = P ijvj/c. At rest, because of spherical symmetry, the stress tensor must
be of the form P = Pr ˆr ˆr + Pt(I − ˆr ˆr), where I is the identity tensor and ˆr is the radial
unit vector. Also at rest the force density f is the electrostatic repulsion and the (5)
reduces to ∇ · P = f . This equation determines P, but the relation between the radial
stress Pr and the transverse stress Pt depends on the particular elasticity properties of
the particle. Nevertheless, the ﬁnal result after integrating over the volume, should be
independent of the particular elasticity model. Therefore, for the sake of simplicity we
will assume a Pascalian (isotropic) pressure; that is, in the rest frame P ij = P δij. The
pressure P is a four-scalar. Then in a generic reference frame

P µν = P (gµν + uµuν/c2).

The momentum and energy equations are then

[(µ + P/c2)γ2v] + ∇ · [(µ + P/c2)γ2vv] + ∇P = f

[(µc2 + P )γ2 − P ] + ∇ · [(µc2 + P )γ2v] = f · v.

It is interesting to compare these equations with the non-relativistic ones (c → ∞).
The only pressure terms that appear in the non-relativistic equations are the gradient in
(8) and the pressure that is inside the divergence of (9). Note that the P/c2 terms in (8)
do not disappear in the limit v/c → 0. This means that, in this case, the non-relativistic
limit is diﬀerent from the small velocity limit. In other words, the inertia of pressure is
a purely relativistic phenomenon. Neglecting the inertia of pressure is at the origin of
some of the discussed puzzles. The P/c2 terms that add up to µ are related to the 4/3
problem. The additional −P term in the time derivative of (9) is related to the power
unbalance.

In order to obtain the equations of motion for the particle we integrate over the
whole volume. As µ and P vanish outside the particle the divergence terms disappear.
That is the reason why, in the Newtonian mechanics, the pressure has no eﬀect on the
motion of the whole particle. Let us consider the ﬁrst term of the left hand side of (8),

The pressure has two eﬀects: First it contributes to the eﬀective mass of the particle.
Second, as long as (19) is veriﬁed, it cures the power unbalance. The pressure mass mP
could be negative, as it is in the charged particle case. A proper mechanical behaviour
requires a positive eﬀective mass m0 + mP > 0, otherwise the acceleration would be
opposite to the force.

In the rest of the paper there will be no confusion between the velocity of a point
in the particle and the velocity of its centre, so in the following we will drop the zero
subscript of v0, a0 and γ0.

4. Stresses in the charged particle

Consider a particle with a spherically symmetric charge density, that in the rest frame
is ρ(y) = qg(y), where q is the charge. The fraction Q(r) of charge contained inside a
sphere of radius r is deﬁned as

and

The force density is the sum of an external force density and the contribution
of its own electromagnetic ﬁelds, f = fex + fem, with fem = ρE + c−1j × B. The
electromagnetic ﬁeld F µν has two components, a local ﬁeld F µν
L which decays as r−2
and the radiation ﬁeld F µν
R which decays as r−1 and is proportional to the acceleration.
The self-force fem has therefore four terms corresponding to the electric and magnetic
forces of the local and radiation ﬁelds. The local electric ﬁeld depends on acceleration
EL(a). We will deﬁne the electrostatic force density as fes = ρEL(0) ; this is the
largest term, by deﬁnition it is independent of acceleration, but by symmetry it does
not contribute to the net force. It does contribute to the power. The remaining local
electric force density ρ(EL(a) − EL(0)) and the other three terms will be included in
the ﬁeld reaction force density ffr, so fem = fes + ffr. The force of the local magnetic
ﬁeld, of course does not contribute to the power, but it does give a contribution to the
total force which is of ﬁrst order in the acceleration.

The momentum and energy of the local ﬁeld are bound to the particle and
contribute to its total energy and momentum. When the particle moves with constant
velocity the local ﬁeld is easily obtained with a Lorentz transformation of the electric
ﬁeld at rest. When the particle is accelerated the local ﬁeld is modiﬁed far away from
the particle. So the local ﬁeld momentum and energy are only slightly dependent on
the acceleration. The zeroth order can be calculated using the constant velocity ﬁelds.

The electrostatic energy Ue can be evaluated with any of the following equivalent

At rest the (8) reduces to ∇P = fes, from where the pressure can be obtained. In
general it also depends on fex and on ffr, but as ffr ≪ fes and as it is supposed that
the external force does not deform the particle, those dependencies will be neglected.

If we add these results to the energy (m0 + mP(1 − γ−2))c2γ and momentum
(m0 + mP)γv of the particle the expected results are obtained for the dressed particle,
(m0c2 +Ue)γ and (m0 +Ue/c2)γv. Why does the momentum of the ﬁeld have the famous
4/3 factor? Exactly for the same reason why the momentum of the particle is not the
bare one: because the ﬁeld is not free and therefore it has stress. The eﬀect of the stress
of the ﬁeld is cancelled by the eﬀect of the stress of the particle.

The stress tensor P µν given by (7) and (30) is identical to the term that Schwinger
[10] found that had to be added to T µν in order to obtain a four-momentum with
electromagnetic mass Ue/c2. We see that no ad hoc assumptions are needed, the term
is just the pressure inside the particle.

In order to completely solve the 4/3 problem we have to prove that (19) is veriﬁed.

The electrostatic force density is

It is obvious that fes does not contribute to Fem because ∫ d3x fes = 0, but it is the
leading contribution to the power unbalance. In fact we are assuming that fex does not
stress the particle, so ∫ d3x fex · δv = 0. On the other hand the electric component of

5. Conservation laws of the ﬁelds

In this section we will consider the conservation laws of energy and momentum of the
ﬁelds. If T µν is the momentum-energy-stress tensor of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and f µ
em
is the force density acting on the particle then the conservation law is

∇µT µν = −f ν

em.

As the electromagnetic ﬁeld is the sum of local and radiation terms, the tensor,
which is quadratic, contains cross terms that are products of local and radiation ﬁelds,
L + T µν
T µν = T µν
R . Introducing energy densities, Poynting vectors and Maxwell
tensors, (44) is equivalent to

C + T µν

(uL + uC + uR) + ∇ · (SL + SC + SR) = −fem · (v + δv)

(45)

(SL + SC + SR) + ∇ · (TL + TC + TR) = −fem.

(46)

Now we will integrate both equations over the whole space. One has to be careful
R decays as r−2. So we take a volume V , surrounding the particle, so large
C ≈ 0 outside V . In these conditions the radiated power and the

reaction should be subtracted from the self-force Fem in order to obtain the force that
the dressed particle feels. We will call this last force radiation reaction,

6. Radiation reaction

The calculation of the self-force is much simpler if it is done in the reference frame
of instantaneous rest. To begin with, there are no magnetic ﬁeld contributions so we
have only to calculate the electric ﬁeld.
It is very convenient in this case to split
the electric ﬁeld into electrostatic and induced components, E = Ee + Ei, with the
following properties: ∇ · Ee = 4πρ, ∇ × Ee = 0 and ∇ · Ei = 0. Note that Ee is
the longitudinal and Ei the transverse ﬁeld. With these deﬁnitions, in the rest frame,
fes = ρEe and ffr = ρEi. As we have previously explained in the integrated self-force

Radiation reaction of a classical quasi-rigid extended particle.

Fem the electrostatic contribution cancels out. The easiest way to determine these ﬁelds
is to use the Coulomb gauge, ∇ · A = 0, because in this case the potential φ yields Ee
and A yields Ei,

For the quasi-rigid motion the charge density is ρ(x, t) = qγg(y) and the current
density is j = ρ(v + δv), where y = r + (γ − 1)(r · ˆv)ˆv, y = |y| and r = x − x0(t).
With these deﬁnitions we have in the rest frame

As was expected it is an average of the retarded accelerations, therefore no violation of

in closed form instead of the troublesome power expansion one gets when the Lorenz
gauge is used. The sum of that power expansion appears in the textbook of Jackson
[3], and indeed our equation (72) can be deduced from equations (16.28–16.30) of that
book.

time (i. e. the time that the light takes to traverse the particle) and therefore the non-
relativistic equation can be used. Our purpose is to solve (77) in order to express the

Causality requires that G(t) = 0 for t < 0. That implies that (m − K(0) + K(ω))−1
must be regular for Im(ω) > 0. K(ω) is regular for Im(ω) > 0, so the only possible
singularities are poles when m − K(0) + K(ω) = 0. For η ≥ 0 K(iη) is real and
limη→∞ K(iη) = 0. When g(r) ≥ 0, K(iη) decreases monotonically from K(0) to
zero. Even when there are regions in which g(r) is negative K(iη) > 0. Therefore
(m − K(0) + K(ω))−1 is regular in the upper half of the complex plane if, and only if,
m > K(0). That is, it must be m > 4
3Ue/c2. Note
that this is the same condition discussed in section 3.
If the condition is fulﬁlled
G(t) ∼ θ(t) exp(−t/τG) and τG ∼ τ .
If the condition is not satisﬁed, causality is
violated and run-away solutions appear. Let us look in more detail how this happens.
Consider a case in which the external force was constant for t < 0, and then suddenly
vanishes at t = 0. The self-force Fem given by (72) is opposite to the acceleration and
remains the same at the transition, Fem(0+) = Fem(0−) = −K(0)a(0−). The motion is
determined by (14). For t > 0 the acceleration equals Fem divided by the eﬀective mass
of matter m0 + mP = m − K(0), in particular a(0+) = −(m − K(0))−1K(0)a(0−). If

3Ue/c2, or equivalently m0 > 1

Radiation reaction of a classical quasi-rigid extended particle.

15

m0 + mP > 0 the new acceleration is opposite to that of negative times and, as time
elapses, the accelerations for t > 0 subtract from the previous ones in (72); therefore
the self-force is reduced and the acceleration vanishes exponentially. On the contrary if
0 < m < K(0), the new acceleration not only has the same sense of the previous one but
it is actually larger than it. As time elapses the self-force increases and the acceleration
diverges exponentially.

The mass condition was previously demonstrated for the spherical charged shell by
Moniz and Sharp [18]; here we have shown that it is valid for any charge distribution
and have clariﬁed its relation with the inertia of stress.

The equation (84) can be re-written as

The equation (90) was proposed by Rohrlich [16] as the correct one for point
particles. We see that as long as the mass condition m > 4
3Ue/c2 is fulﬁlled the radiation
reaction can be expressed by (88) which conforms to causality and does not produce
run-away solutions. The approximated expression of (90) does produce violations of
causality when FR ∼ Fex. When this happens the condition of (89) is not satisﬁed, so
the approximation is not valid.

A particle can be considered a point particle if its radius is negligible when compared
with the wave-length of the radiated ﬁeld. This condition is equivalent to (89). So (90)
can indeed be considered the correct one for point particles. It is worth noting that
applied forces with discontinuities, that violate (89), are very common. However, usually
such discontinuities are not real, but the result of some approximation. In most cases
the formula of (90) behaves properly if, instead of discontinuities, realistic smoothed
steps are used.

8. Radiation reaction four-force and radiated power

The radiation reaction of the physical point charge with v = 0 is given by equation (90).
In this section we ﬁnd this force for a particle moving with arbitrary speed.

A four-force K µ that conserves mass is related to the force by K i = γF i and to
the power by K 0 = γF · v/c. This implies that it is orthogonal to the four-velocity
K µuµ = 0. In the rest frame K i = F i and K 0 = 0.

The motion equations of the dressed mass, (56) and (57), show that the radiation
reaction is a mass-conserving force. Then, the four-force of the radiation reaction of the
physical point charge is in the rest frame

Therefore, if we call K µ the external four-force and τ the proper time, the radiation

reaction four-force is in an arbitrary reference frame given by

9. Conclusion

We have completely solved the self-force of the extended quasi-rigid particle. We
have shown that, provided m0 > 1
3Ue/c2, it is a perfectly consistent classical system
conforming to causality and conservation of energy and momentum. In order to obtain
the correct equations it is essential to use the relativistic conservation equations of energy
and momentum for the continuous medium, even if v ≪ c; only so the inertia of pressure
is properly taken into account. The mathematical point charge (R = 0) is inconsistent
with classical electrodynamics. For a given dressed mass m and charge q, the minimum
radius that any particle can have is (2q2)/(3mc2). Nevertheless if the radius of a particle
is much smaller than any other distance in the problem, the radius becomes irrelevant
and the particle can be properly considered as a point charge from the physical point
of view.

A comment about QED. A correct quantum theory of a system, should give in the
classical limit a proper classical system. As the mathematical point charge is inconsistent
in classical electrodynamics, it follows that the proper quantum theory of a structureless
particle (such as the electron) should have as classical limit an extended classical particle.
At ﬁrst sight this is not impossible as the single particle picture breaks down at the
Compton length scale, which is 137 times larger than the classical radius of the particle.

I wish thank Dr. Victor Villalba for many enlightening discussions and for thoroughly
reading this piece of work.

Inferior bounds for phase synchronization

(Dated: February 21, 2014)

An approach is presented for coupled chaotic systems, estimating an inferior bound value for the
absolute phase diﬀerence, in order to say that phase synchronization is present. This approach
shows that synchronicity in phase implies synchronicity in the time of events. This is used to derive
an equation to detect phase synchronization, based on the absolute diﬀerence between the time of
these events. A phase based on the vector ﬁeld is also introduced. It can be used to calculate the
frequency of attractors with non-coherent phase dynamics.

This work deals with the phenomenon of phase syn-
chronization (PS) [1, 2] in coupled chaotic systems, which
describes interacting systems that have a bounded phase
diﬀerence, despite of the fact that their amplitudes may
be uncorrelated. PS was found in many natural and
physical systems [1, 2], being experimentally observed in
electronic circuits [3], in electrochemical oscillators [4],
in the Chua’s circuit [6], and in spatio-temporal systems
[5]. There are also evidences of PS in communication
processes in the Human brain [7, 8].

In the case of two coupled systems, PS between them

exists if

|φ1 − qφ2| ≤ c,

(1)

where φ1,2 are the phases calculated from a projection of
the attractor onto appropriate subspaces X1,2, in which
the trajectory presents special coherent properties [1].
The rational constant q is the frequency ratio between
the average phase growing and c is a ﬁnite constant to
be determinate, diﬀerent from zero.

The purpose of this work is to give an inferior bound
value for the constant c in Eq. (1), in terms of a deﬁned
phase [10]. We show that c can be estimated as the aver-
age growing of the phase, calculated for typical trajecto-
ries, in one of the subspaces. Particularly, c= hW i × hT i,
where hW i is the average angular frequency associated
to a subspace X , and hT i is the average returning time
of trajectories in this same subspace, calculated from the
recurrence of events of the chaotic trajectory. Similarly
to periodic oscillating systems, in which it is valid to say
that an angular frequency ω is related to the period T
by ω = 2π/T , for chaotic systems it is valid to say that
hW i = c/hT i, where c is the bound constant in Eq. (1).
Whenever the information about the vector ﬁeld of a
coupled chaotic system is not easily accessible, or if one
has only partial information about the dynamics of the
system, like in bursting/spiking systems in which the only
accessible information might be the inter-bursting/inter-
spike time intervals, we derive some conditions which
holds for PS states. This could be used to describe PS in
terms of either the number of events or the time for some
speciﬁc events occurrence. This approach is a conse-
quence of the fact that the phase diﬀerence can be treated
by a variable that considers the phase diﬀerence between
events in both systems. Finally, we also show that the

time of events from which hT i is calculated can be used
to construct special stroboscopic mappings, called basic
sets in Ref.
[11], which have particular characteristics
when PS exists. These characteristics are an alternative
way of detecting PS.

For illustrating our ideas, we use two coupled R¨ossler
oscillators, and two coupled neuron models from the
Rulkov map [12]. This last example was chosen because
we want to demonstrate that PS can be detected by only
knowing the time at which bursts occur (events).

We start by developing some ideas to give a minimum
bound for c in Eq. (1). For simplicity, we eliminate the
constant q, given by q= hW1i
hW2i , by a changing of variable,
φ2(t)′ = qφ2(t). With a slight abuse of notation, from
now on, we omit the ′ symbol in the phase.

We begin by deﬁning a time series of events, where
event here is the crossing of the trajectory to a given
Poincar´e section. Being Σ the attractor of the coupled
system, and X1 and X2 two subspaces (on which the
phase is deﬁned), τ i
1 describes the time at which the i-th
event happens in X1, and τ i
2 describes the time that the
i-th event happens in X2. We consider the average return
time, hTji, of the subspace Xj to be the average of time
intervals T i
between two events in Xj, for N

At the times τ i

2, we observe the instantaneous
position of the trajectory of the attractor Σ. These in-
stantaneous observations of the attractor, realized for the
times that events occur, are chaotic subsets of the attrac-
tor, named D. This subset projected on the same sub-
spaces where the phase is deﬁned, Xj, are named as Dj.
If all neighborhoods of Dj do not visit a projection of
the chaotic attractor everywhere, we say that Dj is not
equivalent to this projection of the attractor Xj, and the
subset D is regarded to be a basic set.

The angular frequency of the trajectory projected on

the subspace Xj can be calculated from

To understand how the averages in the subspace X1
are related to the time-intervals of events in X2, and vice-

which is the evolution of the phase from the time τ i

the i-th event happens in X2) until the time τ i+1
(when
the (i+1)-th event happens in X2). Thus, calculating the

average hr1i = (

with hr1i=hW1i hT2i representing the average amount of
increasing in the phase φ1, for an average time interval
given by hT2i. Equivalently, one arrives at hW2i = hr2i
hT1i .
If PS exists, i.e. Eq. (1) is satisﬁed, one should have
that hW1i=hW2i, hr1i=hr2i, and hT1i = hT2i, in these
new transformed variables. Thus, we arrive at

Synchronicity of events: The number of events at
a given time for synchronous oscillators is not always the
same, but can diﬀer by an unity. This occurs because
the N -th event in X1 and X2 may not be simultaneous,
resulting in a diﬀerence of an unity between the number
N1 and N2 of events, in X1 and X2, respectively. So,
we can say that the number of events in PS are always
related by

|N1(t) − N2(t)| ≤ 1.

(5)

This is a physical consideration which assist us to es-
timate a minimal value for the constant c. Note that
Eq. (5) can also be used to detect synchronous events in
maps, in the case an event can be well speciﬁed. As an
example, one can observe the occurrence of local maxima
in the trajectory [13].

Synchronicity in the time of events:

In an asymptotic time Eq. (5) can be written as:

This equation is related to the coherence in the phase dy-
namics. The more phase coherent the attractors are the
1 − T i
more the amount |
2)| approaches to zero. As a
consequence, the value hT1i over estimate the maximum
diﬀerence in the time intervals between events. To over-
come this, we introduce a physical parameter, namely
γ, which brings us information about the coherence of a
speciﬁc system. Thus, we put Eq. (6) as

P

N

|

Xi=0

(T i

1 − T i

2)| ≤ γhT1i,

(7)

with γ ≤ 1. It is important to notice that γ also brings
some information about the projection and about the
section in which the events are deﬁned, once that the
diﬀerence in the time intervals depends on the projection
and on the Poincar´e section deﬁnition. Our calculations
to the coupled R¨ossler-like attractors, show that γ = 1/2.
Note that since we deal with PS, in Eq. (7) we have that
hT1i= hT2i, hr1i= hr2i and hW1i= hW2i. So, we could
have used in the right term either hT1i or hT2i. Further,
when necessary we will opt to use hr1i and hW1i.

We illustrate this idea by analyzing a hypothetical
R¨ossler-Like system, i.e., a trajectory circling around a
ﬁxed point, conﬁned between two concentric circles. This
system resembles a periodic harmonic oscilator, having
the maximum deviation to the harmonic character when
the trajectory spirals towards the ﬁxed point or spirals
out it. At this situations, the diﬀerence in the time inter-
vals becomes larger, and thus, we explore these scenarios
to understand the value of γ. Further, we extend this
discussion to other geometric structures.

We imagine that the time is “frozen” when the N -th
N
event happens in X1. So, N1 = N and τ N
i=0 T i
1.
Then, we analyze what is or not physically allowed to
happen.

1 =

P

In Fig. 1, we represent projections of the trajectory on
the subspaces X1 [(A)-(C)] and X2 [(B)-(D)]. We study a
situation where the trajectory spirals toward the unstable
focus. An event happens when the trajectory crosses a
Poincar´e section, represented by the dashed line. At the
time in which the trajectory realizes (for example) the
10-th event in X1, its position is represented by the ﬁlled
square in (A), the trajectory in X2 had just realized the
9-th event, represented by the ﬁlled square in (B). In this
situation, Eq. (5) would still be satisﬁed. But, as the 11-
th event happens in X1, the trajectory is at the position
represented by the ﬁlled triangle, the trajectory in X2 is
at the position represented by the ﬁlled triangle, and still
around half of the way to realize the 10-th event, which
violates Eq. (5) meaning that PS is not present.

(5) (A-B) is not satisﬁed and when Eq.

FIG. 1: Pictorial visualization of a physical situation in which

always satisﬁed. (A) and (C) represent a projection of the
trajectory on the subspace X1, and (B) and (D) represent a
projection of the trajectory on the subspace X2. The ﬁlled
squares represent the trajectory position at the time that the
10-th event happens in X1, and ﬁlled triangles represent the
trajectory position at the time that the 11-th event happens
in X1.

Now, we imagine that at the moment that the 10-th
event happens in X1 [ﬁlled square in (C)] the trajectory
in X2 is already in half of the way to realize the 10-
th event [ﬁlled square in (D)]. So, at the moment that
the 11-th event happens in X1 [ﬁlled triangle in (C)],
the 10-th event in X2 already happened [ﬁlled triangle in
(D)]. So, as a conclusion, although the diﬀerence between
the number of events can be 1, the time diﬀerence from
the time at which the N -th event happens in X1 and
the time at which the N2-th event happens in X2 (with
N2 = N − 1, or N2 = N , or N2 = N + 1) should be
reasonably smaller than the time of a typical cycle in the
system, given by hT i.

A general allowed situation is pictorially represented
by Fig. 2(A-B), for a situation where PS is still present
but, about to be lost by a small parameter change. The
picture in (C-D) represents a situation for which there
is no PS. The line represents in (A)-(C) the trajectory
in the subspace X1, and (B)-(D) the trajectory in the
subspace X2. The ﬁlled gray region in (A)-(C) represents
the trajectory position at the moment the N -th event
happens in X1. At this time, the ﬁlled region in (B)-
(D) represent the many possible trajectory position in
X2.
In (B), it is typical to have that either the N -th
event already happened in X2 (the trajectory is in the

(5) (A-B) is satisﬁed and when it is not (C-D). We represent

happens in X1.

upper part of the ﬁlled region, with respect to the dashed
line), or the event N will happen (the trajectory is in the
lower part of the ﬁlled region, with respect to the dashed
line). For a matter of simplicity, we consider that at the
moment the N -th event happens in X1, the trajectory in
X2 is in the position represented by the cross in (B).

To understand what is the maximal permitted diﬀer-
ence between the time at which the same number of
events in both subspaces happens, we need to understand
how much time it takes till the trajectory makes the N -
th event in X2. There is a dependence on the devitation
between τ N
2 and the observational section, where
the events are deﬁned. To the studied R¨ossler-Like sys-
tems, in which the instantaneous velocity does not diﬀer
too much from the average velocity, it seems reasonable
to have that γ =1/2, even thought we could choose a
speciﬁc section in which γ could be smaller than 1/2.
However, γ =1/2 is a reasonable over estimation.

1 and τ N

Another important point in Fig. 2(B) is that neigh-
borhoods of the ﬁlled region do not visit everywhere the
region occupied by the trajectory projected on the sub-
space X2. So, the mapping constructed by looking at
the trajectory in X2, at the time events in X1 happen is
a localized structure, when compared with the attractor
projected at this same subspace. At this situation, this
mapping generates a discrete subset of points called ba-
In [11] it was shown that whenever PS exists,
sic set.

the basic sets always exists. So, its detection is an in-
dication that PS exists. In (D), we show what seems to
be a typical situation when there is not PS. The map-
ping of the trajectory on the subspace X2, for times at
which events happen in X1, visits everywhere the attrac-
tor projected at this same subspace. At this situation,
this mapping generates a discrete subset of points, but it
is not a basic set. Thus, this mapping occupy the whole
region delimited by the trajectory in the subspace X2,
and the diﬀerence between the time at which the same
number of events occur, as well as, the number of events
is no longer bounded.

Synchronicity of the phase: We previously saw
that the diﬀerence between the times the same number of
events happen in both subsystems is bounded by γhT1i.
Now, we want to understand which consequences that
this fact brings for the estimation of the constant c.

Multiplying both sides of Eq. (7) by hW1i, we put Eq.

time at which the N -th event happens at the subspace
X1, minus the evolution of the phase at the subspace
X2 from the (N − 1)-th event in X2 until the time at
which the event N happens in X1. This term stablishes
a bridge between the continuous-time formulation of the
phase diﬀerence [Eq. (1)] and the phase diﬀerence be-
tween events.

The amount (ri

that there is a sum over it. In order to consider its con-
tribution, we bring the fact that the phase is known to in-
crease linearly with the time, with a constant ratio given
by the angular frequency [1, 2, 15]. So, it is suggestive to
consider that the diﬀerence (ri

FIG. 3: Pictorial visualization of a situation where PS exists.
We represent in (A) and (C) the trajectory in the subspace
X1, and (B) and (D) the trajectory in the subspace X2. The
ﬁlled regions in (A) and (C) [(B) and (D)] represent possible
trajectory positions at the time the N -th event happens in X2
[X1]. These ﬁlled regions represent projections of the basic
sets on the subspaces that the phase is measured.

To understand the value of the constant β, we bring
again considerations about the structure of the basic sets
observed in PS. In Fig. 3, we show situations in which
PS is always present. In the ﬁlled region of Figs. (A)
and (C), we show trajectory points in the subspace X1,
at the moment in which the N -th event happens in X2.
In the ﬁlled regions of Figs. (B) and (D), we show tra-
jectory points in the subspace of X2, at the moment the
N -th event happens in X1. The most critical situation
in which PS is still present, but about to be lost, by a
small parameter change, typically happens in the follow-
ing situation. If at the N -th event in X2 the trajectory,
in X1, is at the cross in 3(A), and at the N -th event
in X1 the trajectory in X2 is at the cross in Fig. 3(B).
So, the phase in X2 is already one full cycle ahead the
phase in X1. In such a situation, |T i
2| has ability
to approach the value γhT1i, while the phase diﬀerence
|ri
2| has ability to approach hr1i. From Eq. (11),
if |ri
2| = hr1i, when this situation happens, in PS
states, the term σ(i) becomes very small, thus we have
that βhW1iγhT1i = hr1i, and we arrive at β = 1

This means that the arbitrary constant c in Eq. (1)

hr1i is our threshold. The physical meaning is obvious.
If hr1i is the bound for phase diﬀerence, given a number
κ ≥ 1, the value κhr1i is also a bound, but it is not a
minimal one. This means that all phase diﬀerence in PS
is smaller than hr1i, and c can be considered as a ﬁxed
constant, rather than an arbitrary value. Thus,

While Eq. (17) refers to the linear growing of the phase

necessary conditions to describe the phenomena of PS,

events implies synchronicity of the phase between these
same events (and vice-versa), and PS can be detect by
satisfying either one of these equations. That is not the
case of Eq. (5). Satisfying it, only implies that events
are synchronous, and not in PS. However, PS implies Eq.
(5), and therefore, veriﬁcation of Eq. (5) is an indication
that PS exists.

FIG. 4: Pictorial visualization of a situation where PS exists
in coupled systems with a complicated attractor geometry.
We represent the trajectory in both subspaces Xj . The event
is given by the crossing of the trajectory, in an un clockwise
oscillation, with the dashed line. The attractor geometry is
pictorially represented by the slim line. The tick ﬁlled line
represents points in the subspace X1 (X2) when an event hap-
pen in subspace X2 (X1). The tick ﬁlled line represents tra-
jectory points after the N -th event in Xj has occurred, and
the tick dashed line represents trajectory points before the
N -th event in Xj has occurred.

Now, we extend the previous discussion to attrac-
tors with a more complicated geometry as the imaginary
Snowman-type, depicted in Fig. 4, in a situation where
PS is about to be lost, by a small parameter change.
Equivalently to the R¨ossler attractor geometry, in the
Snowman-type geometry it is also valid to say that the
ﬂuctuation of the absolute phase diﬀerence is always lin-
ear related to the ﬂuctuation of the absolute time dif-
ference, as in Eq.
(11). The cross in the tick-dashed
line represents the possible maximum ﬂuctuation of the
phase, let us say in subsystem X1, at the time the N -
th event happens in X2. The diﬀerence from this time,
till the time the N -th event happens in X1, is at most
given by half of the average period of the attractor, let
us assume to be given by γhT1i. The phase diﬀerence,
however, is at most given by the phase growing of the
phase from a trajectory departing from the cross in the
tick-dashed line in Fig. 4 until it reaches the event line,
plus the growing of the phase from a trajectory departing
from the event line till reaches the cross in the tick-ﬁlled
line in Fig. 4. So, the phase diﬀerence is bounded by
the average growing of the phase for one cycle. There-
fore, while the diﬀerence between the times that the same

number of events occurs is at most given by γhT1i, the
phase diﬀerence between these same times is given at
(11) we arrive again that
most by γβhr1i. From Eq.
β ∼= 1
γ and therefore, c=hr1i.

To illustrate our approach we consider two non-

identical coupled R¨ossler oscillators, given by

˙x1,2 = −α1,2y1,2 − z1,2 + ǫ[x2,1 − x1,2]
˙y1,2 = α1,2x1,2 + ay1,2
˙z1,2 = b + z1,2(x1,2 − d),

(20)

with α1 = 1, and α2 = α1 + δα. The constants a=0.15,
b=0.2, and d=10 are chosen such that we have a chaotic
attractor in a phase coherent regime. The subspace
where the phase is computed is guven by X1 = (x1, y1)
and X2 = (x2, y2). The time series, Mτ
j , that deﬁne the
events in Xj (which can also be used to construct the
basic sets), are deﬁned as follows. Mτ
1 is constructed
measuring the time the trajectory crosses the plane y2=0
in X2; Mτ
2 is constructed measuring the time the tra-
jectory crosses the plane y1=0 in X1.

In Fig. 5, we show the coupled R¨ossler oscillator for
a situation where PS exists, i.e., Eq. (19) is satisﬁed [as
well as, Eq. (7). In this ﬁgure, we show bidimensional
projections on the variables of subsystem X2 (A) and X1
(B). In gray, we show the attractor projection, and in
black, projections of the basic sets D2 (A) (trajectory
points at the time the i-th event happens in X1) and D1
(B) (trajectory points at the time the i-th event happens
in X2). Note that the projection of the basic sets, in the
subspaces X1 and X2, are not equivalent to a projection

of the attractor, in these same subspaces, meaning that
neighborhoods of the basic sets projections on the sub-
spaces Xj do not visit everywhere the attractor at this
same projection. This situation is pictorially shown in
Fig. 3(C-D).

time that the N -th event happens in X1. Note that the
phase diﬀerence in (C) is just the phase diﬀerence for the

the growing of the left part of Eq. (9).

FIG. 7:
In (A), we show the phase diﬀerence at the time
the N -th event happens in both subsystems. In (B) we show
ξ(N ), and in (C), we show the phase diﬀerence, at the time
that the N -th event happens in X1. So, the number of events
in X2, N2, can assume either one of the following values (N −
1, N, N + 1). δα = 0.001 and ǫ=0.01. The phase is calculated
from Eq. (3)

FIG. 9: In (A), we show the quantity σ in Eq. (16) for a
situation when PS exists. As we decrease the coupling, Eq.
(19) is not anymore satisﬁed as shown in (B), as well as Eq.
(16), as shown in (C). In (C) we have made a zoom in of the
vertical axis. However, the ﬂuctuation of this variable can
reach a magnitude of the same order of the phase diﬀerence in
(B). In (A), δα = 0.001 and ǫ=0.01 and in (B-C), δα = 0.001
and ǫ=0.000001.

vertical axis. However, the ﬂuctuation of this variable
can reach a magnitude of the same order of the phase
diﬀerence in (B). Note the diﬀerent nature of the ﬂuctua-
tions of the phase diﬀerence in (B) and the term σ in Eq.
(16). That is because the term σ represents the phase
diﬀerence without the linear growing trend, responsible
to make the phase diﬀerence in (B) to present a positive
slope.

In order to compare the phase as deﬁned in Eq. (3)
(for δα=0.001 and ǫ=0.01), and the phase as deﬁned in
[2], we compare the function hrj i, as calculated for both
deﬁnitions. For the phase, as deﬁned in Eq. (3), we ar-
rive at hrj i=6.2984 and so, hrj i > 2π. Other quantities
are hWj i=0.1651, and hTji = 6.07097, the average time
for which one should expect to have a point from Dj to
return to itself. On the other hand, the phase as deﬁned
in [2] is a function that grows in average 2π each time
the trajectory crosses some Poincar´e section, which gives
hrj i = 2π. So, both phase deﬁnitions arrive at two dif-
ferent quantities, but Eq. (19) is valid in order to detect
PS, using both phase deﬁnitions.

To illustrate the generality of the phase deﬁnition in
Eq. (3), we calculate the angular frequency of the fun-
nel attractor, obtained for the parameters a=0.3, b=0.4,
d=7.5, in the R¨ossler system. This attractor has a non-
coherent phase character [16]. For a parameter mis-

FIG. 10: A sample of the variables x1(n) and x2(n), from the
subspaces that correspond to both neurons, for a situation
where there is PS, for ǫ=0.03 (A), and for a situation where
there is not PS, for ǫ=0.001 (B). In (A), Eq. (7) is satisﬁed,
and in (B) is not. In (A), we show three bursts, which are
basically a sequence of spiking.

Now, we give an example for the detection of PS with-
out the knowledge of the state equations, but either only
using a time series of bursting events, or by searching
the existence of basic sets. We consider two non-identical
coupled neurons described by

xj(n + 1) = f [xj (n), yj(n) + βj (n)]
(21)
yj(n + 1) = yj(n) − θ(xj(n) + 1) + θσj + θβj (n), (22)

which produces a chaotic attractor, for θ = 0.001, α2=5,
σ1 = 0.240, and σ2=0.241. The subspaces are deﬁned
as Xj=(xj , yj). β1(n) = g[x2(n) − x1(n)] and β2(n) =
g(x1(n) − x2(n)). The function f is given by

f = αj /[1 − xj(n)] + yj(n),
f = αj + yj(n),

x ≤ 0
0 < x < αj (n) + y
x ≥ α + yj(n)

f = −1,

(23)

The control parameters are α1 and g, with |α1−α2| being
the parameter mismatch and g the coupling amplitude
(cf. [12]). The time at which events occur (also used to
construct the basic sets), from which the quantity hTji
is calculated, is deﬁned by measuring the time instants

FIG. 11: In (A-B), we show the absolute diﬀerence between
the time of the N -th burst, in both subspaces (that represent
the two neurons). In (A), Eq. (7) is satisﬁed (there is PS),
with hT1i=259.028 and, in (B), Eq. (7) is not satisﬁed (there
is not PS). For the same parameters as in (A), in (C) we
show the basic set projection D1 (gray), while for the same
parameters as in (B), in (D) there is not a basic set. For (A)
and (C), α1=4.99 and ǫ=0.03. For (B) and (D), α1=4.99 and
ǫ=0.001.

in which the variable xj , of subsystem Xj, is equal to
xj = −1.2 (the event is the occurrence of a burst) [17],
and Nj is the number of bursts of the subsystem Xj. In
this example, PS exists if Eq. (7) is satisﬁed, which also
means that Eq. (5) is satisﬁed.

In Fig. 10, we show the variables x1(n) and x2(n)
for a situation where there is PS (A), and for a situation
where there is not PS (B). Note that in (A), although the
neurons are phase synchronized, the diﬀerence between
the number of bursts in the variable x1(n) minus the
number of bursts in the variable x2(n) might be diﬀerent

(5).

In Fig. 11(A-B), we show the absolute diﬀerence be-
tween the time of the N -th burst, in both neurons. In
(A), Eq. (7) is satisﬁed (there is PS) with hT1i=259.028,
and therefore 0.5hT1i=124.5014, much bigger than the
maximum ﬂuctuation in (A). In (B), there is no PS. In
(C) and (D), we show a projection of the attractor on the
variables (x1, y1), in black points, and the subsets D1, in
gray points. In (C), a projection D1 of the basic set on
the subspace X1 is shown, and the projection of the at-
tractor on this same subspace is clearly not equivalent to

9

D1. In (D), the attractor projected in X1 is equivalent
to a projection on the same subspace of the subset D1,
In (B) and
which means that there are no basic sets.
(D), hT1i = 396.964, and hT2i = 398.407.

Concluding, we estimate the inferior bound value of the
absolute phase diﬀerence between two coupled chaotic
systems, in order to verify the existence of phase syn-
chronization. Our approach shows that this bound value
hri is given by the average evolution of the phase, calcu-
lated in a subspace of the attractor, for a series of pairs of
events in another subspace of the attractor. These events
can be the number of local maxima or minima in the tra-
jectory, the crossing of the trajectory to some Poincar´e
section, or the occurrence of a burst/spike.

This result was achieve because we can inspect for
phase synchronization looking for the phase diﬀerence
at the times for which the same number of events hap-
pens in both subsystems. The advantage of looking at
the phase diﬀerence at these times, instead of looking at
the continuous phase diﬀerence, is that this approach al-
lows us to detect phase synchronization by looking for
a bounded time diﬀerence between events. This is help-

ful for chaotic systems from which there is no available
information about the state equations.

If only the number of events is available, one can also
ﬁnd evidences of PS by checking that the absolute dif-
ference between the number of events has to be smaller
or equal than 1. This allows to infer the existence of
PS in maps. These maps can be either be derived from
a ﬂow, by measuring events as the trajectory crosses a
Poincar´e section, or by detecting local maxima of the
trajectory. This latter type of event can be used to de-
tect PS in dynamical systems with a discrete formulation.
Finally, we have demonstrated the general character of
the deﬁned phase in Eq. (3), by calculating the angu-
lar frequency of the funnel attractor, an attractor whose
trajectory presents non-coherent phase properties, and
by showing a situation for which two coupled R¨ossler
systems, previously in the funnel regime, enter a phase
synchronous regime by a parameter alteration.

[9] In Eq. (1), we assume that the coupled system reached
equilibrium, i.e., the asymptotic dynamics. Otherwise,
one could introduce another ﬁnite constant inside the left
side of this equation.

[10] Phase can be deﬁned as a Hilbert transformation of a
trajectory component, as the angle of a trajectory point
into a special projection of the attractor, or as a function

that grows 2π, every time the chaotic trajectory crosses
some speciﬁc surface. In this work, we deﬁne phase to be
a measure of the absolute rotation of the tangent vector
in the subspaces Xj .

[13] In Ref. [14], PS is deﬁned by the diﬀerence between the
number of events being equal to zero. More precisely,
|N1(t) − N2(t)| = 0. But, this assumption is too strong
to detect PS, once that the trajectories of phase syn-
chronous systems may be uncorrelated. So, the diﬀerence
between events might diﬀer by an unit, in a generical
case.

[17] This threshold enables to detect the time at which a burst
starts. In fact, due to small ﬂuctuations of the trajectory
close to the used threshold, xj =-1.2, we only consider
that a burst starts (the event happened), if after the tra-
jectory having crossed the threshold at xj=-1.2, it crosses
eventually another threshold, positioned in xj =0, before
it crosses again the threshold xj=-1.2, in the next event.

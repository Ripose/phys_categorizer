Abstract

Standard formulae of classical electromagnetism for the forces between elec-
tric charges in motion derived from retarded potentials are compared with those
obtained using an instantaneous Coulomb force described by a 4-vector electro-
magnetic potential. Problems discussed include small angle Rutherford scattering,
Jackson’s recent ‘torque paradox’ and circular Keplerian orbits. Results consistent
with special relativity are obtained only by use of an instantaneous potential. The
impossiblity of stable circular motion with retarded ﬁelds in either classical electro-
magnetism or Newtonian gravitation is demonstrated.

Introduction

Classical electromagnetism (CEM), in particular Maxwell’s equations, played an im-
portant role in the development of special relativity (SR). This does not however mean
that CEM, even as presented in modern text books, is a theory fully compatible with
SR and and devoid of interpretational problems. This point was strongly emphasised by
Feynman [1]. On the other hand, the most successful physical theory of the 20th cen-
tury, as much for its powers of prediction as for its precise experimental veriﬁcation, is
quantum electrodynamics (QED) [2] . Again, as stressed by Feynman [3], the elements
of this theory are very simple: charged particles and real or virtual photons described
by appropriate wavefunctions or propagators and a single coupling constant, the elemen-
tary electric charge. In QED the mechanical forces between charges are mediated by the
exchange of space-like virtual photons. As discussed, in detail, in a recent paper by the
present author [4], the exchange of such photons is instantaneous in the centre-of-mass
(CM) frame of two interacting charges. This is a consequence of the relativistic formula
for velocity in terms of kinematical quantities: v = pc2/E. Energy-momentum conserva-
tion shows that E(γ∗) vanishes whereas, in general, p(γ∗) is non-zero for a virtual photon,
γ∗, in the CM frame of any scattering process, implying that its velocity is inﬁnite. This
conclusion is conﬁrmed by the study, in [4], of the invariant amplitude in momentum
space for Møller scattering, e−e−

e−e−, and its Fourier transform.

→

There is no reason to suppose that the space-like virtual photons responsible for the
electromagnetic forces in Møller scattering should not also be at the origin of the elec-
tromagnetic forces between the electrons in two current-carrying conductors separated by
macroscopic distances. Thus there should be a close connection between CEM and QED.
Just this connection was explored in the second part of [4]. In the ﬁrst part of this paper
all of the mechanical equations of CEM, as well as Maxwell’s equations, were derived
from Coulomb’s inverse-square force law, SR and Hamilton’s Principle. The equations
describing inter-charge forces, although consistent with standard CEM formulae in the
limit where O(β2) terms are neglected, diﬀer signiﬁcantly from them when terms of O(β2)
and higher, are included. The main aim of the present paper is a comparison of the RCED
(standing for Relativistic Classical Electro-Dynamics) formulae from [4] with the conven-
tional text book formulae of CEM, to be found, for example, in [5, 6, 7]. Indeed it is
found that the latter, corresponding, for moving charges, to retarded potentials and ﬁelds
do not respect the constraints of SR. As will be seen, this is one source of the previously
unresolved problems of CEM which Feynman found to be of such great interest.

The other source of problems and paradoxes in CEM is that electromagnetic forces
apparently do not respect Newton’s third law. An explanation in terms of non-mechanical
momentum and angular momentum residing in static electric and magnetic ﬁelds has
been attempted by many authors [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] over the last half-century. The
present author’s opinion is that this is not the correct explanation, and that Newton’s
third law is actually always respected by electromagnetic forces, without the need to
introduce non-mechanical degrees of freedom. One important point in this connection is
the instantaneous nature of electromagnetic forces, a second is the correct treatment of
relativistic eﬀects, and the third is the understanding that the mass of an object is only
a constant in the complete absence of interactions, which is evidently not the case for

1

objects undergoing mutual electromagnetic interactions1 .

In fact it is clear that when all physical quantities are properly deﬁned Newton’s third
law must be obeyed because it is a necessary consequence of Newton’s ﬁrst law, (the
law of inertia) and the deﬁnition of ‘force’ provided by the relativistic generalisation of
Newton’s second law. The proof of this is now brieﬂy sketched. Given a dynamical theory
it is always possible to obtain an equation such as:

˙~pO = ~fO(X, αi, αj...)

(1.1)

where ~pO is the relativistic momentum (see (1.6) below) of an object O, the dot denotes
a time derivative and ~fO is a known function of the space-time position X
(ct; ~x) of
O and some ﬁxed parameters αi, , αj.... The vector ~fO is the relativistic generalisation
of what is deﬁned by Newton’s second law as a ‘force’. Actually, however, this naming
operation is the entire physical and logical content of the second law. The dynamics is
completely deﬁned by the knowledge of the time derivative of the relativistic momentum
(1.1). Nothing is gained, except in an anthropomorphic sense, by baptising the right side
of this equation a ‘force’. If it happens that ~fO = 0 in (1.1) then:

≡

which is Newton’s ﬁrst law. Suppose now O is composed of two parts O1 and O2 so that:

Diﬀerentiating (1.3) with respect to time and transposing gives:

~pO = constant

~pO = ~pO1 + ~pO2 = constant

˙~pO1 =

˙~pO2

~fO1 =

~fO2

−

−

or, using (1.1)

which is Newton’s third law. It is clear that it is a necessary consequence of the ﬁrst law
(1.2) and the deﬁnition (1.1) of ‘force’ provided by the second law. The third law must
then be obeyed if the relativistic momentum is correctly deﬁned. The apparent violations
found in CEM have arisen because this has not been done in the examples considered.
This will be shown in detail in a paper [16] currently in preparation.

The general deﬁnition of the relativistic momentum of an object is:

~p

m(X)

= m(X)γ~v

≡

dX
dτ

1/√1

where ~v is the object’s velocity, τ its proper time, γ
v/c and X is the
space-time position of the object. Only if the latter is in free space, and undergoes no
interaction with the force ﬁelds of other objects, is the mass, m, a constant. A simple
example of the variability of the masses of interacting objects is provided by the case of
1The concept of an eﬀective mass for a particle, depending upon the strength of the interactions it
undergoes, is a familiar one in the theory of conduction in the solid state. The relation between the
energy and momentum of a conduction electron can be markedly diﬀerent from that for a free electron,
for those occupying energy levels near to the upper or lower boundaries of a conduction band [15].

line in their common CM frame. At a certain distance, xO, of each object from their
common center of energy, they come to rest, due to their mutual repulsion. The energy

Since E is constant, due to the conservative nature of the interaction, it is clear that
any change in the momentum of the objects must be accompanied by corresponding
changes in their masses. Another example of position-dependent masses is given below in
Section 6 where circular Keplerian orbits of a system of two electrically charged objects
are discussed.

The structure of this paper is as follows: In the following section the RCED formulae
for the electric and magnetic force ﬁelds of a uniformly moving electric charge are derived
from Coulomb’s Law and the 4-vector character of the electromagnetic potential.
In
Section 3 small angle Rutherford scattering is calculated in diﬀerent inertial frames, using
either RCED force ﬁelds or the conventional retarded ﬁelds. It is shown that the latter,
when used in the initial rest frame of an electron scattered by a heavy charged particle,
give a result incompatible with both the known Rutherford scattering formula and the
Bethe-Bloch energy-loss relation. In this section it is also shown that the forces predicted
by the retarded ﬁelds do not respect the law of conservation of relativistic transverse
momentum. In Section 4 the breakdown of Gauss’ law for the total ﬂux of the RCED
electric force ﬁeld of a charge in uniform motion is demonstrated. In Section 5 the recent
‘torque paradox’ of Jackson is resolved by employing the RCED force ﬁelds, that, unlike
the conventional retarded ones, are consistent with SR. Section 6 presents an analysis of
circular Keplerian orbits in RCED. The relativistic generalisation of Kepler’s third law
for such orbits is derived. In Section 7 the question raised by 19th century astronomers,
and recalled by Eddington [17], concerning the possibility of stable orbital motion under
the inﬂuence of retarded ﬁelds, is addressed, for the case of circular orbits in electrically
bound systems, and a negative answer is found. The ﬁnal section is a summary of the
results obtained.

2 Force ﬁelds of a moving charge in relativistic clas-

sical electrodynamics

The expressions for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds in RCED found in [4] are here
rederived for the simpler case of a uniformly moving charge by exploiting the 4-vector
character of the electromagnetic potential, A, and assuming Coulomb’s law of force be-
tween static charges with an instantaneous interaction. The usual covariant deﬁnitions2
of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds 3[18] are used:

3 Small angle Rutherford scattering with instanta-

neous or retarded ﬁelds

−

Rutherford scattering of an electron of charge,

e, and mass, m, by a nucleus of

charge, Ze, and mass, M, is considered in two frames of reference. The ﬁrst is the rest
frame, SN (coordinates (t′; x′, y′, z′)) of the nucleus (essentially the overall centre-of-mass
frame of the two body scattering problem) the second is the rest frame, Se (coordinates
(t; x, y, z)), of the initial electron. As in a similar discussion in [19] a large impact pa-
rameter, b, is considered so that the geometrical deﬂection of the electron trajectory in
SN and the change in position of the electron in Se, during the scattering interaction, are
neglected. Also neglected are changes in the velocities of the electron or nucleus during
the scattering interaction. Geometrical parameters in the frames SN and Se are deﬁned in
Figs. 1a and 1b respectively, while Fig.1c shows the deﬁnition of the scattering angle, θ,
SN . The scattering
of the electron momentum vector in the centre-of-mass frame SCM ≃
angle is given, in the small angle approximation that is made here, as :

∆p
p

θ

≃

(3.1)

p is the electron momentum in SCM and ∆p is calculated by integrating the transverse
impulse produced by the electric ﬁeld of the nucleus during the passage of the electron in
SN or of the nucleus in Se. Small eﬀects due to magnetic ﬁelds in Se (which, since they are
transverse to the electron velocity, do not contribute to
) are neglected. The electric
ﬁeld is calculated either from the RCEM formula (2.10) or by use of the standard formula
for the electric ﬁeld of a moving charge given in textbooks on classical electrodynamics.
This is the same as the ‘present time’ version of the retarded Li´enard-Wiechert (LW)[20]
ﬁeld, which was ﬁrst derived by Heaviside [21].

In the frame SN , the electric ﬁeld at the position of the electron is given, in both cases,

by a static Coulomb ﬁeld, since the source charge is at rest:

in the x′- and y′-directions. In the frame Se, where the nucleus is in motion, diﬀerent
formulae are found for the electric ﬁeld in the two cases:

where ˆı and ˆ are unit vectors in the x- and y-directions. Although the transverse ﬁelds
given by (3.3) and (3.4) agree when ψ = π/2, the angular dependence for ﬁxed r is very
diﬀerent, as may be seen in Figs.2 and 3. which show respectively ELr2/Ze and ET r2/Ze,

5

as a function of ψ, for various values of β. It can be seen in Fig.3 that the denominator of
the right side of (3.4) strongly damps the strength of the transverse electric ﬁeld, except
for values of ψ close to π/2, for values of β close to unity. On performing the integral
over ψ to calculate ∆p a much smaller value of θ is then to be expected for a given value
of b for ~E(Se, LW ) as compared to ~E(Se, RCEM). This is indeed found to be the case.

In b) the electron is initially at rest in Se while the nucleus is in motion. c) shows the
deﬁnition of the electron scattering angle, θ, in the overall center-of-mass frame, SCM . To

In Jackson’s book [19] a result consistent with (3.12) was found for the calculation in
the frame Se using ~E(Se, LW )7. This is because the calculation eﬀectively used, in (3.13),
the time t′ deﬁned in the frame SN instead of the correct time t in the frame Se. Making the
dt′ in (3.13) and using (3.7) gives a result, the one quoted by Jackson,
replacement dt
consistent with (3.12). A footnote in [19] indicates that the author has realised that ∆p
was calculated in the frame Se, whereas the relation for the scattering angle, (3.1), is valid,
instead, in SCM , where the longitudinal electron momentum is γmv. There is then the
statement:
‘The reader may verify that (13.3)’ (i.e. (3.9) above)‘and (13.4)’(i.e. (3.10)
above) ’are also correct in the frame in which the electron is at rest by transforming the
angles from the CM system to the laboratory’. Actually, this is impossible to do, because
the electron scattering angle is undeﬁned in the electron rest frame. The calculations of
∆p in the frames SN and Se above using the retarded ﬁeld (3.4) show, instead, results
that diﬀer by a factor γ. The calculation of the scattering angle performed in Se then
gives an angle a factor γ smaller than the known Rutherford scattering result (2.10). Use
of ∆p calculated with (3.4) in Se then leads to a (1/γ)2 dependence of the energy-loss
formula at relativistic velocities, in contradiction both with the Bethe-Bloch formula and
experiment [24].

That the transverse ﬁeld in (3.3) is larger, by a factor γ, than the static value in (3.2),
for any value of ψ, is a necessary consequence of the invariance of relativistic transverse
momentum will now be demonstrated. Since the Lorentz transformation leaves invariant
transverse spatial intervals: ∆y = ∆y′, relativistic transverse momentum must also be
conserved:

dy′
dτ
Considering now the transverse momentum, pT , of the electron in Jackson’s problem and
associating the frame S with SN and S’ with Se

motion of the electron in Se is non-relativistic. If pT is generated by transverse forces FT ,

since ∆τ = ∆t/γ = ∆t′/γ′. Thus conservation of transverse momentum requires the
transverse electric ﬁeld in Se to be a factor γ larger than that in SN for all values of ψ.
This condition is respected by ~E(RCEM) in (3.3), but not by ~E(LW ) in (3.4), for which
the condition is satisﬁed only for ψ = π/2. The forces generated by the retarded ﬁeld (3.4)
therefore do not, in general, respect the invariance of relativistic transverse momentum,
in diﬀerent inertial frames, that is required by SR.

7The integration variable was a time rather than the angle ψ.
8This, the opposite of the previous assignment, is done for clarity of presentation. Here it is the rest
and moving frames of the scattered electron rather than those of the nucleus N that are under discussion.

is readily calculated from the formulae (3.3) and (3.4) for diﬀerent choices of a surface,

centered on the charge and (ii) a cylindrical surface with axis parallel to the direction of
motion of the charge, of length 2ℓ and radius a, with the charge at the axis mid-point,
are, for the RCED and the retarded LW ﬁelds:

The ﬂux of the retarded LW ﬁeld is independent of the velocity of the charge and of
the form of the surface S, but, as can be seen in Fig.3, the electric ﬁeld strength peaks
strongly near ψ = π/2 for large velocities β
1. The number of ﬁeld lines is conserved
but their spatial distribution changes with the velocity of the charge. This change in the
distribution of the ﬁeld lines is often interpreted as due to relativistic ‘length contraction’
[22]. However, the ﬂux of the RCED force ﬁelds do not, as is clear from (4.2) and (4.4),
respect Gauss’ theorem, or the electrostatic Maxwell equation, when the source charge is in
motion. The ﬂux depends both on the velocity of charge and the geometry of the surface
S. For large values of γ the ﬂux is proportional to γ, but with diﬀerent multiplicative
constants for spherical or cylindrical surfaces. In RCEM, both the tranverse ﬁeld and the
total ﬂux are proportional to γ at large γ, whereas in the same limit the transverse LW
ﬁeld is proportional to γ only for ψ = π/2, while the total ﬂux is velocity independent.
There should be nothing shocking in these properties of the ﬁelds. As discussed in [4], the
force ﬁelds are only mathematical abstractions introduced in order to write inter-particle
forces in a compact manner. The physical reality resides in the particles and the forces
between them, not in the ﬁelds. All equations of motion may be written down and solved
without the necesssity to introduce either the concept of a force or that of a ﬁeld. Just
this approach is taken in the discussion of Keplerian orbits in Section 6 below. The total

11

ﬂux of the ﬁeld, though readily calculable, has no independent physical meaning and it
is irrelevant, for the dynamical description of the motion of the charges, whether the ﬂux
respects, of not, Gauss’ theorem. However the forces derived from the ﬁelds must respect
on the one hand, the constraints of SR and on other be consistent, in the appropraiate
limit, with the known and tested predictions of QED. As several examples in the present
paper show, this is the case for the instantaneous RCED ﬁelds, but not for the retarded
LW ones.

5 Resolution of Jackson’s torque paradox

Another example of the incompatibility of the LW retarded ﬁelds with relativistic in-
variance is provided by the ‘torque paradox’ recently pointed out by Jackson [23]. Replace
in Fig.1b the moving nucleus by an electron at rest. The electric ﬁeld at e is then a static
Coulomb ﬁeld parallel to ~r. This is the only force-generating ﬁeld in the frame Se and
gives no torque. Now, on boosting from Se into SN , both electrons move with velocity v
parallel to the x-axis. According to the LW formula (3.4), the electric ﬁeld is still parallel
to ~r and therefore generates no torque. However, in SN , the electric current constituted
by the lower electron produces at e a magnetic ﬁeld of magnitude:

~B(LW ) = ~β

7 The impossibility of uniform circular motion under

retarded Li´eard-Wiechert ﬁelds

Several years before the advent of special relativity the eﬀect on electric and magnetic
ﬁelds, propagated at the speed of light, was considered by Li´enard and Wiechert [20]. A
good explanation of the underlying physics may be found in Reference [5]. In this case the
values of the ﬁelds at a given space-time point are given by the sum of the contributions
from all sources that lie on the backward three-dimensional light-cone of the space-time
point considered. Neglecting relativistic eﬀects (as of course Li´enard and Wiechert were

~A(X) = q~v/r are modiﬁed according to the relations[5]:

where the quantities in large curly brackets are evaluated at the retarded time: tret =
t
r/c at which the source charge is sampled by a signal moving along the backward
light-cone of the space-time point X = (ct; ~x). The electric and magnetic ﬁelds derived
from these potentials are given by the expressions[25]:

The possibility of uniform circular motion of two objects with equal and opposite
electric charges and diﬀerent masses, interacting mutually via the ﬁelds (7.3)-(7.5) above is
now investigated. As in the previous section, the geometric constraints of uniform circular
motion are imposed and a solution of the equations of motion of the objects consistent with
these constraints is sought. Various geometrical parameters used to describe the system
are deﬁned in Fig.5. The objects O1 and O2 of masses, in the absence of interaction, m1
q are assumed to perform uniform circular motion
and m2 and electric charges q and
about their centre of energy O. The radii of the circular orbits of O1 and O2 are r1 and r2.
Cartesian axes Ox, Oy and Oz speciﬁed by unit vectors ˆı, ˆ and ˆk are chosen with y-axis
parallel to ~r2 at some instant and x-axis in the plane of the orbits. The resultant force on
O1 due to the retarded ﬁelds of O2 is now calculated and examined for consistency with
uniform circular motion. According to Eqn(7.3) ~Evel
ret(1) points to the ‘present
position’ (assuming uniform motion) of the source charge. Calculating the retarded ﬁelds
of O2 at O1 when the latter is at position A in Fig.5 at t = 0, implies that the ﬁelds are
given by the formulae (7.3)-(7.5) when O2 was at position B at time t =

points towards the point C on the tangent to the orbit of O2 at B. The distance BC is

10The object O2 does not actually follow this trajectory under its assumed circular orbit. However,
causality implies that only the velocity of the source at the instant it is sampled on the backward light-
cone of the point at which the ﬁeld is evaluated is relevant. Any change in the motion (velocity or
acceleration) of the source at later times therefore cannot aﬀect the retarded ﬁeld. The retarded ﬁeld

of Newton’s third law, that cannot, due to the non-factorisable force components on the
right sides of (7.9) and (7.10), be restored, as in the discussion of the previous section, by
the introduction of diﬀerent eﬀective masses for the interacting objects. Also, since the
resultant force is non-central, an unbalanced torque acts on the system. The unbalanced

In [17] Eddington discussed the case of the (almost circular) orbits of Jupiter and the Sun
under the action of retarded gravitational ﬁelds. A simple geometrical argument suggests
that Jupiter and the Sun would then be subject to accelerating torques. Eddington
then considered the analagous electromagnetic problem, and citing the Heaviside formula
(3.4) for the electric ﬁeld of a moving charge, stated that the direction of the retarded
force is ‘very nearly’ in the direction of the centre of mass in this case.
It was then
concluded that there is no unbalanced torque problem for the Sun-Jupiter system, and
that it may be generally assumed that the gravitational force propagates at the speed
of light. The calculation presented above shows this conclusion to be incorrect. As the
formulae (6.1) and (6.2) follow from only the inverse-square force law, SR and Hamilton’s
Gm1m2, are expected to hold
Principle, similar formula, with the relacement q1q2 → −
in Newtonian gravitation, when special relativistic corrections are included. In this case
also, stable circular orbits cannot be obtained with retarded gravitational ﬁelds.

8 Summary

The present paper is a sequel to [4] where inter-charge forces in classical electrody-
namics were derived from Coulomb’s law, SR and Hamilton’s Principle. An essential
aspect of the derivation is the instantaneous nature of the electromagnetic forces, demon-
strated in [4] to be a prediction of QED. In standard text books on classical electromag-
netism [5, 6, 7] no clear distinction is made between ﬁelds describing mechanical forces
(the eﬀect, in QED, of the exchange of space-like virtual photons) and ﬁelds giving a
classical description of radiative processes (in QED, the creation or destruction of real,
on-shell, photons). The importance of such a distinction, the former ﬁelds being instan-
taneous, the latter propagating at the speed of light, was pointed out many years ago
by Chubykalo and Smirnov-Rueda [26]. This conjecture is fully supported by the work
presented in [4] and the present paper.

The distinction between the standard text-book formulae, denoted in the present paper
by the labels CEM or LW (for Li´enrad-Wiechert) and those (denoted by RCED) derived
in [4] or Section 2 above, is most succinctly expressed in terms of the electromagnetic
In
potentials generated by uniformly moving electric charges in the diﬀerent theories.
CEM, no distinction is made between ﬁelds describing mechanical forces and radiation
processes. In both cases the electromagnetic potential is assumed to be of the form ﬁrst
derived by Li´enrad and Wiechert [20]:

where all quantities in the large curly brackets are evaluated at the retarded time tret =
r/c. In RCED there are two physically distinct types of ﬁelds. The ﬁrst, describing
t
mechanical inter-charge forces are derived, using (2.1) and (2.2), from the potentials:

−

≡

where u
(γc : γ~v) is the 4-vector velocity of the moving charge. These potentials as well
as the associated ﬁelds and forces are instantaneous. The retarded potentials of RCED,
describing radiation, are the same as (8.1) and (8.2) above, except for an overall factor γ
necessary to obtain a 4-vector:

The diﬀerent physical interpretations of the ﬁelds derived from Af or and Arad are discussed

components of a 4-vector, and so it is not to be expected that the ﬁelds and forces derived
from them will respect SR. It has been demonstrated in the present paper that indeed
they do not, whereas the RCED ﬁelds and forces do.

In fact since (8.1) and (8.2) were derived by Li´enrad and Wiechert some seven years
before Einstein’s ﬁrst SR paper, it would be little short of miraculous if they constituted
a 4-vector. A similar remark applies to the consistency with SR of the ‘present time’
formula (3.4) for the retarded electric ﬁeld of a uniformly moving charge. This may be
derived from (8.1) and (8.2), but was ﬁrst obtained by Heaviside [21] in 1888. It may
be noted, on the other hand, that a velocity-dependent scalar potential, consistent with
(8.3) up to O(β2) was proposed as early as 1861 by Riemann [27]11.

The mechanical forces in CEM derived from (8.1) and (8.2) have been compared above
with those of RCED derived from (8.3) and (8.4). In Section 3 it is shown that use of
the CEM formula (3.4) to calculate small-angle Rutherford scattering gives a scattering
angle smaller by a factor 1/γ than the well-known standard result, that is recovered by
It is also shown in Section 3 that that conservation

of relativistic transverse momentum requires that transverse forces in diﬀerent inertial
frames scale according to 1/γ (see Eqn(3.17)). This condition is respected by the RCED
ﬁelds but not by the CEM ones. In Section 4 it is shown that the ﬂux of the electric
ﬁeld of a moving charge in RCED does not (unlike in CEM where the electric ﬂux is the
same for a charge at rest or in motion) respect Gauss’ Law. The ﬂux depends both on
the velocity of the charge and the geometry of the bounding surface. The electric ﬁeld
is a mathematical abstraction useful to simplify dynamical formulae expressed in terms
of forces, but has, unlike charges and their motion, no objective existence. In Section 5,
Jackson’s ‘torque paradox’ [23] for two interacting charges, where electric and magnetic
ﬁelds are derived from the CEM potentials (8.1) and (8.2) is discussed. A non-vanishing
torque is predicted in one inertial frame, a vanishing one in another, in contradiction with
the special relativity principle.
It is shown that use of RCED ﬁelds gives a vanishing
torque in all inertial frames, consistent with SR. In Section 6 it is demonstrated that
stable, circular, Keplerian orbits are possible for two oppositely-charged objects using
exact RCED dynamical formulae. An exact relativistic generalisation of Kepler’s third
law relating the orbit period to the separation of the charges is derived for this case. In
Section 7 the impossiblity of stable circular motion under forces derived from retarded
CEM ﬁelds is demonstrated. Such forces do not respect Newton’s third law and, as already
conjectured during the 19th Century for the analagous gravitational case [17], generate an
unbalanced torque. Stable orbital motions of electrons in atoms or of planets around the
Sun are only possible if (as Newton assumed for the case of gravity) the inverse-square-law
electrical or gravitational forces act instantaneously.

11The same Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866) is better known for his hypothesis concerning the distri-
bution of prime numbers, and for pioneering applications of topology to the theory of complex functions.
Together with Weber and Clausius, he attempted to construct an action-at-a-distance theory of elec-
tromagnetic forces in which the fundamental physical objects were charged particles, not ﬁelds. See the
second reference in [27]. This is also the approach adopted in [4] by the present author. Such theories were
generally superseded in the second half of the 19th century by Maxwell’s electromagnetic ﬁeld theory.

Denoting by δt the time of passage of O2 from B to E (Fig.5) then:

From the geometry of Fig.5:

r = r1 cos φ1 + r2 cos φ2

r1 sin φ1 = r2 sin φ2
φ = φ1 + φ2

r1v2 = r2v1

It follows from (A1-A5) that: φ = β1 + β2, φ1 = β2+O(φ3

Substitution of α given by (A11) into (A9) gives Eqn(7.6) of the text.

Since the modulus of the velocity vector of an object in uniform circular motion is
constant, the increment δ ~β2 for O2 is anti-parallel to the radius vector ~r2. It then follows
from Fig.5 and the geometrical conditions (6.6) that:

~r

Abstract

In the combination of crossed electric and magnetic ﬁelds and the Coulomb ﬁeld of
the atomic nucleus the spectrum of the Rydberg electron in the vicinity of the Stark
saddle-point are investigated at a quantum mechanical level. The results expose a
quantum anomaly dissociation: quasibound states near and above the saddle-point
ionization limit predicted at the semi-classical level disappear at a quantum mechan-
ical level.

Twenty years ago Clark et al. [1] claimed that the combination of crossed electric and

magnetic ﬁelds and the Coulomb ﬁeld of the atomic nucleus can lead to the localization

of the Rydberg electron in the vicinity of the Stark saddle-point. When the characteristic

parameter ω2

t > 0 in the classical equation of motion the electron motion is periodic in an
elliptical orbit. such orbits give rise to electron states which are localized above the saddle-

point and whose spectrum is that of a harmonic oscillator. Divergent hyperbolic trajectories

are obtained in the case when ω2

t < 0. The classical equation of motion includes both type
of solutions. The periodic orbits are unstable with respect to small perturbations, thus

assume the character of quasibound states. Ref. [1] focused attention on the energy region

near the ionization threshold for the ﬁrst time in literature. The distinctive character of

this portion of the spectrum makes it an attractive target of experimental investigation.

Their treatment is semi-classical. The determination of the lifetimes of these states and

their associated transition moments awaits a full quantum mechanical treatment.

In this Letter we investigate the above system at a quantum mechanical level. The

results expose a quantum anomaly dissociation: bound states which exist at a semi-classical

level may disappear at a quantum mechanical level. For the present example, we clarify that

quasibound states near and above the saddle-point ionization limit predicted in Ref. [1]

do not exist at a quantum mechanical level. This explains the reason that non of the

suggested experiments yet has been realized.

A particle trap using static ﬁelds must conﬁne the electron about the Stark saddle-point

where the net electric force vanishes. We therefore consider the Schr¨odinger equation in

coordinates centered about the saddle point rather than about the atomic nucleus.

In

this coordinate system the coordinates of the electron are (x1, x2, x3). The electric ﬁeld

the classical equation of motion. At a quantum mechanical level the vector potential Ai

which elucidates that ω2

a is exactly negative, independent of the choice of the magnetic ﬁeld
B and the electric ﬁeld E. At the quantum mechanical level normalization conditions of

wave functions of bound states are a key point. The negative ω2

a shows that a normalized
wave function ψa(Xa) of bound states of the mode a does not exist, thus for the whole

system a normalized wave function Ψ(Xa, Xb) = ψa(Xa)ψb(Xb) of bound states does not
exist either. This observation clariﬁes that quasibound states predicted in [1] do not exist

at the quantum mechanical level.

Up to now the quantum anomaly dissociation exposed in the above system is an only ex-

ample. At the present the clariﬁcation of general conditions leading to such a phenomenon

is an open issue. Studies on this subject are important for experimental atomic physics

which are based on the semi-classical treatment.

[5] It was realized that in the general case of 4-dimensional space-time the ﬁeld strength

Fµν by itself does not, in quantum theory, completly describe all electromagnetic eﬀects

on wave functions of the electron, that is, it underdescribes electromagnetism. The

4-vector potential Aµ includes more information, but some additional information is

not measurable. This raises the question of what constitutes an intrinsic and complete

description of electromagnetism. An examination of the Bohm-Aharonov experiment

indicates that a complete description that is neither too much nor too little is the
phase factor exp (cid:2)(ie/¯hc) H Aµdxµ(cid:3) of the 4-vector potential Aµ. See T. T. Wu, C. N.

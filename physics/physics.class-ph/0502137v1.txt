Abstract

Simpliﬁed description of an experiment of the Michelson-Morley
type being completed at the University of Western Australia with a
discussion of the possible meanings of its outcome.

Introduction

Besides the statements of its general principles and main foundational equa-
tions every physical theory requires some decreed assumptions to establish a
link between physical measurable quantities and its theoretical counterparts.
Special and General relativity are no exceptions except for the fact that after
so many years and so many accomplishments the physical quantity length
and the derived concept of distance has remained elusive to say the least.

The most explicit of these interpretative assumptions in relativistic the-
ories is that one that declares that the interval of time measured with an
atomic clock should be identiﬁed with the interval of proper time calculated,
for any space-time model, along the world-line describing the motion of the
clock.

There is no generally accepted counterpart to this assumption when the
concepts of length or distance are involved although the main trend tries
to reduce any measure of distance to a measure of time via light signals
ignoring thus any reference to a more ﬁtting concept. We show in this paper
that this does not need to be so and that other possibilities remain to choose
interpretative assumptions for the quantity length that can be falsiﬁed by
experiments, and in particular by the Western Australia experiment by Tobar
et al., [1], now in process of being completed.

1 Frames of reference with constant angular

velocity

Let ds2 be the line element of Minkowski’s space-time referred to a system
of Cartesian coordinates of a Galilean frame of reference so that:

ds2 =

c2dT 2 + dX 2 + dY 2 + dZ 2

−

The motion of a frame of reference with constant angular velocity Ω is a
time-like Killing congruence with parametric equations such as:

T = t
y sin Ωt
X = x cos Ωt
Y = x sin Ωt + y cos Ωt
Z = z

−

where x, y, z are coordinates of the quotient space and the parameter t is
a particular time coordinate deﬁning one among all other possible synchro-
nizations. Using this system of adapted coordinates to the rotating frame of
reference the line-element of the space-time becomes:

ds2 =

ξ2c2dt2 + 2ω(xdy

ydx)cdt + dx2 + dy2 + dz2

−

−

where ω = Ω/c, and :

that can be split as follows:

ξ =

ρ =

with:

ds2 =

ψ2 + dˆs2

ψ =

ξcdt + ωξ−1(xdy

−

−

which is the 1-form whose components are the covariant components of the
unit vector ﬁeld tangent to the killing congruence, and with:

dˆs2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2 + ω2ξ−2(y2dx2 + x2dy2

2xydxdy)

(10)

Let us consider a domain of the rotating frame of reference where there
is at rest a medium with index of refraction n so that the velocity of light in

this medium is vn = c/n. According to well established theory, [3], if light is
propagating freely it will follow a geodesic of the following space-time metric:

ds2

n = ds2 + (1

1
n2 )ψ2

−

And similarly if light, because of multiple reﬂexions, or equivalent constraints,
is forced to propagate along any space circuit, still its propagation will have
to satisfy the condition:

Let us consider in particular a closed circuit C with parametric equations:

dsn = 0.

x = fx(χ),

y = fy(χ),

z = fz(χ)

such that:

fx(χ0) = fx(χ1) = x0,

fy(χ0) = fy(χ1) = y0,

fz(χ0) = fz(χ1) = z0 (14)

From (11) and (12) it follows that:

dt

The sign of the second term in the r-h-s depends upon the direction in which
light is propagating. Therefore if two light rays leave the point P0 at proper
time τ0 and propagate in diﬀerent directions then they will reach again the
point P0 at two diﬀerent proper times τ+ and τ− such that:

2 Free mobility of ideal rigid bodies

Suppose that we want to give an operational meaning to Eq. (17). The l-h-s
has a very clear meaning: it is the mean proper period of light propagating
in both directions. This is not the case of the r-h-s. To make sense of it we

3

need to be able to identify the measurable properties of the circuit with the
geometrical ﬁgure that describes it. If in particular we are dealing with a
circular circuit C with a measured radius r according to any given protocol
we need to know how to use this value using a chosen geometry of space.
More precisely: we need to know how to derive from this value of r the
parametric equations of the circuit C, and then to calculate the line-integral
of Eq. (17).

We know that the result should be intrinsic, i.e. independent of the system
of coordinates being used, but it can not be, as we show below independent
of a crucial choice of a metric to describe the geometry of space.
Is this
choice that we claim in Sec 4 can be subject to an experimental test. Let dl2
be this metric, that at this stage it can be considered as an auxiliary metric,
chosen for convenience:

dl2 = aijdxidxj
(18)
where x1 = x, x2 = y and x3 = z. To give a meaning to the r-h-s of Eq.
(17) the strategy that we shall implement in Sec. 4 will be the following: i)
we shall obtain and use the geodesic coordinates, [4], xi′
(xj) of (18) so
that:

= xi′

1
3
to the second order of approximation around the point C0, the center of the
circle, with coordinates xi′

Ri′k′j′l′xk′

ai′j′ = δi′j′

= 0;

(19)

xl′

−

and ii) we shall use the fact that in this system of coordinates a geodesic

disk of radius r centered at C0 is a central section of the sphere:

(x1′

)2 + (x2′

)2 + (x3′

)2 = r2;

The most apparently natural choice that we could make to choose a metric

of space would be to assume that dl2 = dˆs2 because:

where L is any path orthogonal to the Killing congruence of the frame of
reference. This is the choice that most authors take for granted.

A second choice to describe the geometry of space that is directly sug-
gested by (17), but has also been proposed following other considerations,
[5], is:

(20)

(21)

(22)

dˆs2 =

ds2

ZL

ZL

dˇs2 = ξ−2dˆs2

4

A third choice that we shall consider in Sec. 4 is:

d˜s2 = ξ2dˆs2

(23)

This metric has been considered in [6], [7] and [8] because it cures some odd
anomalies of the Schwarzschild and Curzon space-times, and for technical
convenience in [9] and [10].

But none of these metrics is ﬂat and this poses a serious problem of
principle. In fact it is elementary knowledge of Riemannian geometry that
whatever is this geometry, as long as it does not has constant curvature, the
ratio L/r, L being the perimeter of a geodesic circle, depends on the location
and the orientation of this circle. That is alright to model a particular circular
circuit with a measured physical radius r and perimeter L as long as we
restrain from moving it from point to point or from changing its orientation.
But, in principle, no metrologist should accept these restrictions.

In Sect. 4 we shall see that under the conditions of the Western Australia
experiment we may be tempted to dismiss this free mobility problem of ideal
rigid bodies as irrelevant, and this would be indeed the case if we thought
only in terms of manufacturing speciﬁcations of real rigid bodies. But as we
shall see the prediction of the outcome of the experiment is very sensitive to
whatever choice is made: either to dismiss it or to cure the problem.

A fourth choice that we shall consider is to implement the Principle of
free mobility introducing a ﬂat metric 1 intrinsically associated to the Killing
congruence. We developed elsewhere, [11], a general theory to do that but
the full theory is not needed here because the metric (10) is particularly
simple and can be written as:

dˆs2 = dκ2 + dz2
(24)
where dκ2 is a 2-dimensional Riemannian metric of a 2-dimensional manifold
with coordinates x, y. Therefore we know from one of Gauss’s theorems that
it is possible to ﬁnd a function µ such that the metric:

d¯s2 = e2µdκ2 + dz2

be ﬂat. Actually the function µ that satisﬁes the required regularity condi-
tions at the axis of symmetry is:

(25)

(26)

µ = ξ

ln(1 + ξ−1)

1 + ln 2

and it is unique.

1A constant non zero curvature does not seem appropriate here.

3 Whispering gallery modes

Whispering gallery modes are being used in the Michelson-Morley experiment
that is in the process of completion at the University of Western Australia
and that we shall analyze in the next section from the theoretical point of
view. Below we shall give a very simpliﬁed description of what these modes
are but we refer interested readers to references [1], [2].

Let us consider a circular ring, made of a dielectric with magnetic per-
meability µ = 1 and electric permittivity ǫ so that the index of refraction
is n = c√ǫ, where light circulates around in both directions. We assume
that the amplitude A of either wave is the same as well as the frequency ν
but, although as we shall see in the next section this will be irrelevant, for
completeness we do not assume that the periods of rotation τ+ and τ− are
equal. Consequently we deﬁne two wave-lengths λ+ and λ− such that:

νλ+ =

νλ− =

L
nτ+

,

L
nτ−

(27)

where L is the length of the ring. The amplitude Φ of the superposition of
the two waves is:

Φ = A cos(2πνt

where l is the winding length around the circle measured from an arbitrary
point on it. Equivalently we can write:

4 The Western Australia experiment

In the Western Australia experiment two Whispering gallery modes are ex-
cited around two great circles of the surface of two sapphire spheres with
a diameter of 5 cm . One of them, say A, has one of its diameters in the
direction of the vertical of the location and it is slowly rotating around this
direction. The second one, say B, is horizontal and although it rotates with
A we may as well consider it as ﬁxed for the purpose of analyzing the experi-
ment. The frequencies νA and νB are continuously monitored and compared.
We give below our analysis of this experiment.

The experiment is being made at the University of Western Australia that

is at a co-latitude θ = 58◦ South. Therefore we have:

where R is the radius and Ω is the angular velocity of the Earth, which is the
relevant frame of reference to consider here. From now on we shall neglect
the powers of δ.

At this approximation we have the following expressions for the four met-

rics (22)-(25):

dˆs2 = (1 + ω2y2)dx2 + (1 + ω2x2)dy2

2ω2xydxdy + dz2
dˇs2 = (1 + ω2(2y2 + x2))dx2 + (1 + ω2(2x2 + y2))dx2

Since by construction the fourth metric d¯s2 is Euclidean there exists a

system of coordinates that will bring it to the Cartesian form:

To do that the appropriate change of coordinates is:

d¯s2 = d¯x2 + d¯y2 + d¯z2

x = ¯x +

y = ¯y +

z = ¯z

Using this convenient system of coordinates the four metrics above can be
written collectively as:

dl2 = (1 + αω2 ¯ρ2)(d¯x2 + d¯y2) + (1 + βω2 ¯ρ2)d¯z2

(45)

where α and β are two parameters whose values are:

if dl2 = d¯s2 then α = 0,
if dl2 = dˆs2 then α = 3/2,
if dl2 = dˇs2 then α = 5/2,
if dl2 = d˜s2 then α = 1/2,

β = 0
β = 0

The metric dl2 in a geodesic system of coordinates anchored at the point
C0 with coordinates x′ = y′ = z′ = 0 can be derived using (19) and (50). We
get thus:

¯y0 = R sin θ sin φ ¯z0 = R cos θ

Let us consider a geodesic circle with center at C0 lying in a plane or-

thogonal to the axis of rotation. The parametric equations will be then:

x′ = r cos χ,

y′ = r sin χ,

z′ = 0;

where r is its geodesic radius, i.e. its proper length in the sense of the chosen
geometry of space. Calculating the perimeter of the circle we get:

Lh =

While if the plane of the circle contains the axis of rotation then its parametric
equations are for example:

z′ = r sin χ

and we get:

This shows that the ratio L/r depends, strictly speaking, upon the orien-
tation of the circle, except in the case when dl2 = d¯s2, i.e. α = β = 0.
Therefore none of the remaining metrics should be used in principle to de-
scribe the geometrical properties of ideal rigid bodies. On the other hand
since:

Ωr
c ≈

(60)

(61)

it can be argued that this change of shape is well beyond the speciﬁcations
under which the sapphire spheres are manufactured and therefore are irrele-
vant to the experiment that we are describing. This would be to forget that
the modiﬁcations shown by Eqs. (57) and (59) are not elastic deformations
i.e.: they do not depend on any physical property. In fact in our opinion they
may just reveal an inadequacy in the choice of metric. The purpose of this
paper is to claim that these two points of view can be tested by the Western
Australia experiment.

neglecting any terms of order δη or smaller:

therefrom, choosing appropriately the parametric equations of the circuit C
the r-h-s of (61) can be calculated.

Let us choose as origin of the angle ϕ describing the rotation of A the
position of the plane of this circle when it lyes along the meridian of C0. The
parametric equations of the circle A are then:

Conclusion

The Western Australia experiment has been conceived as a test of Special
relativity, but as we understand it, it is mainly a test of a crucial collateral
assumption having to do with the geometry of space in a frame of reference
co-rotating with the Earth. This is not a trivial matter that can be dismissed
invoking a Principle of Lorentz Local Invariance saying that only the instan-
taneous velocity with respect to a local non-rotating frame of reference is
what matters in describing the experiment, because this principle is also a
collateral assumption that needs to be substantiated.

Keeping in mind that the reliability of our analysis strongly depends upon
the ﬁdelity of the over-simpliﬁed model of Whispering Gallery Modes that we
have used to real ones, we give below a short description of possible outcomes
with an indication of what they would mean.

As we see from (71) and (69) the signature that we have derived as a
prediction for the outcome of the experiment depends on two parameters
(α, β) each pair corresponding to a possible choice for describing the geometry
of space, or in other words, to a choice to identify an operational measure of
length with a calculated geometrical quantity. We have mentioned four such
choices, with diﬀerent justiﬁcations, but we could as well leave the choice
open and let experiments decide which is the best choice to make.

Two of the choices that we have considered deserve a particular attention.
The ﬁrst one is (α = 3/2, β = 0), i.e. dl2 = dˆs2 and if this is correct the
experiment will not give any meaningful signal: both frequencies νA and νB
will remain constant up to the precision that it is achieved. A value of a2
signiﬁcantly below 10−13 would undoubtedly favor this interpretation, and
could be considered an important conclusion because it would be the ﬁrst
test of the crucial assumption that it implies.

The second choice, which in our opinion deserves a particular attention
is (α = 0, β = 0), i.e. dl2 = d¯s2. If this is correct this will mean that the
Principle of free mobility of ideal rigid bodies holds and this opens the door to
a better understanding of what length and distance mean in Special relativity
beyond the Galilean frames of reference, as well as in General relativity. On

12

the other hand if this principle does not hold then we are afraid that it will
be harder than we thought to develop a satisfactory general theory about
frames of reference.

An outcome of the same order of magnitude as in the preceding case
with diﬀerent values of α and β would be a surprise, but an encouraging one
because it would strongly suggest anyway the dynamical importance of the
rotation of the Earth to understand the Western Australia experiment.

Finally, let us say that any other outcome would be also a surprise, and
in this case a puzzling and exciting one. It is only in this case that we could
allow any credibility to the fact that we have peeped beyond the domain of
validity of Special relativity.

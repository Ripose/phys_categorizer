1 Introduction

Charged particle radiation in layered media has been considered in many papers (see

e.g.

[1] and [2] and references therein). The interest in these systems is caused by the

possibility of their use as high energy particle detectors [2].Detecting properties of these

systems are based on the transition radiation. Transition radiation originating in such

systems can be explained in the following way (see [1] and [2]). A charge moving in

a medium creates an electromagnetic ﬁeld (a pseudophoton), which is scattered by the

inhomogeneities of dielectric permittivity and converted into radiation. The key problem

is account correctly for the scattering of pseudophotons on the inhomogeneities.

In earlier articles (see, for example , [2]) which have addressed to the problem of

radiation of relativistic charged particles in a system of plates embedded in a homogeneous

medium the reﬂection of the electromagnetic ﬁeld by an individual plate is neglected.

However from experience with three dimensional random media [3] and [4] we know

that the multiple scattering of electromagnetic ﬁelds plays an essential role. This role is

particularly important in the optical region which we have mainly in mind.

In the present paper we consider multiple scattering eﬀects (taking into account also

reﬂection) when a charged particle radiates passing through a one-dimensional random

medium. Such media can be, in particular, those systems in which the plates are randomly

spaced in a homogeneous medium.

It turns out that multiple scattering of the pseudophoton leads to its diﬀusion is the

dominant in the medium and this diﬀusion contribution to the radiation intensity. The

diﬀusion contribution leads to a strong dependence of the radiation intensity on particle

energy and plate number, a fact that is important for the detecting properties of the

system. Note that the diﬀusion contribution is absent in an ordered stack of plates.

2 Formulation of the Problem

The system considered in the paper consits of a stack of plates randomly spaced in a

1

homogeneous medium. Let the plates ﬁll the regions zi −
is the plate thickness and zi are random coordinates). The dielectric permittivity of the

a/2 < z < zi + a/2 (where a

system may be represented in the following form:

Xi

where ε0(ω) and b(ω) are respectively dielectric permittivities of the homogeneous medi-

um and of the plates, and Θ is a step function. It is convenient to represent the dielectric

permittivity as a sum of average and ﬂuctuating parts:

ε(z, ω) = ε + εr(z, ω),

< εr(z, ω) >= 0,

where ε =< ε(z, ω) >, εr ≪
determined as follows

ε and averaging over the random coordinates of plates is

3 Radiation Tensor

(10)

As usual, we decompose the electric ﬁeld into two parts, ~E = ~E0 + ~Er. Here ~E0 is

the electric ﬁeld of the charged particle moving in homogeneous medium with dielec-

tric permittivity ε, and Er is the radiation ﬁeld caused by ﬂuctuations in the dielectric

permittivity. We deﬁne the radiation tensor as follows

Iij( ~R) = Eri( ~R)E∗

rj( ~R)

Here ~R is the radius-vector to the observation point, which is far from the system, R
L.
The vector potential is decomposed in a similar way: ~A = ~A0 + ~Ar, where ~A0 and ~Ar, as

In obtaining (11) we assumed that the ﬂuctuations of dielectric permittivity are much
smaller than its mean value εr ≪

To carry out averaging over the random coordinates of plates, we express the radiation

potential Ar in terms of the Green’s function of the equation (10)

where k = ω√ε/c.

The decay length of pseudophoton in the z direction is determined by the imaginary part

of the Green’s function, in the following way (see., e.g. [6])

As one could expect, the decay length depends on the pseudophoton momentum direction.

in (26) by bare one (15) functions. Since the observation point ~R is far from radiating

7 Pseudophoton Mean Free Path

The pseudophoton mean free path in our theory is described by the expression (24). In

the impurity diagram method [5], as usual, we don’t take into account the diagrams

which correspond to the situation of three or more plates at the same point. This is valid

provided that

the Born approximation is fulﬁlled. However it is well known [5] that the formulae are

also correct in the general case provided that one employs the exact scattering amplitude

instead of Born scattering amplitude. In our case this means that formula (49) is correct

in the general case provided that a suitable expression is used for pseudophoton mean

free path l(ω).

The photon mean free path in the medium is related to the photon transmission

It follows from (49) and (50) that the maximum of spectral radiation intensity lies in the

frequency region where transmission coeﬃcient is minimal. It follows from (50) that the

minimal value of l(ω) is 1/n. Now we shall clarify the conditions under which this value

is achieved. In the Born approximation

radiation intensity in typical transition radiation from a single interface in the optical

region is logarithmic (see, for example,[2]). In order to ﬁnd the dependence of the ra-

diation intensity on the number of plates, note that Lz = N/n and from (49) one has

8 Conclusions

We have considered the diﬀusion contribution for radiation intensity of a relativistic

particle passing through a stack of randomly spaced plates. It was shown that for a large

number of plates N

forward intensities of relativistic charged particle radiation intensity are equal, whereas

in the regular stack case relativistic particle radiates mainly in the forward direction.

Now let us discuss the possible experimental realizations of our theory. For applicabil-

ity of the theory the fulﬁlment of the following inequalities is necessary λ

The transition radiation of relativistic charged particles in a stack of plates has been

investigated experimentally in many papers (see, for example, [8]). Unfortunately in

these papers only the X-ray region was studied. In the X-ray region the above-mentioned

inequalities are not satisﬁed. Optical transition radiation of relativistic particles has

been investigated in experimental work [9]. However in this experiment only one or two

parallel plates were used. Samples in [9] were prepared by vacuum deposition of various

metallic coatings (Al, Ag, Au, Cu) on mylar foils 3.5µm thick. Note that these samples

are optimal for our goals. They ensure minimal transmission due to metallic coatings

and weakness of absorption due to mylar foils. So it will be interesting to investigate

experimentally the optical (λ

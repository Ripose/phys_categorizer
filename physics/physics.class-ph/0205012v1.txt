Simple expression for self-force acting on radiating rigid charged ball is
derived (Sommerfeld ball). It is shown that appropriate delayed equation of
motion has solutions in general diﬀer from that for Sommerfeld sphere - there
are no ”radiationless” solutions, but there are oscillating without damping
solutions though self-force has nonzero value.

03.50.De

Long time ago to calculate back-reaction of electromagnetic ﬁeld on mov-
ing with acceleration a charged classical (not quantum) particle of ﬁnite size
Sommerfeld [1] considered two models - uniformly charged rigid sphere and
uniformly charged rigid ball and found out explicit expressions for electro-
magnetic self-forces.

These expressions in nonrelativistic limit are much simpler then the origi-
nal ones. Thus for uniformly charged rigid sphere (with radius a, total charge
Q and mass m ), moving along trajectory ~R = ~R(t), the equation of motion
with self-force, which include the back-reaction of electromagnetic radiation,
is the known delayed equation (see, for ex., [2-5])

m ˙~v(t) = ~Fself + ~Fext,

here ~v = d ~R/dt, η ≡ Q2

~Fself = η [~v(t − 2a/c) − ~v(t)]
3 ca2 , and ~Fext - some external force.
This equation is often considered in literature (see, for ex., [2-5, 6, 7])

(1)

and has the following signiﬁcant features:

1.) there are no ”runaway” solutions - all solutions of (1) for zero external

force exponentially tend to zero for t → ∞ (are damped);

1

2.) there are ”radiationless” solutions - solutions with zero value of the
self-force, though the body moves with acceleration. In particular, for har-
monic oscillations appropriate radiationless frequencies have discrete values.
As for charged rigid ball with radius a and total charge Q, till now there
were not known the compact forms of nonrelativistic self-force and the fol-
lowing expansion in powers of a/cT was used:

~Fself (t) = −

One can derive this result as from the strict Sommerfeld result so from the
well-known general Jackson form for a self-force in nonrelativistic, linear in
velocity and its derivatives approximation for spherically symmetrical body

Using (5) in (2), we get the result (1).

For our goal - to construct compact form of self-force in case under consid-
eration - it will be more convenient to use another representation of Jackson
result (2-3).

It is not too complicate to notice that the expansion (2-3) can be rewritten

in the form of Taylor expansion of delayed acceleration ~a = ˙~v of a body:

~Fself (t) = −

The equation of motion of Sommerfeld ball then reads:

¨~R(t) = ~Fself (t)/m + ~Fext(t)/m

To compare features of equation (7) with that for Sommerfeld sphere we
consider the case of zero external force and search for solutions of (7) in the
form of harmonic oscillations with frequency w, in general being complex
number:

~R(t)[−3] = ~A exp (iwt)

Consequently eq.(7) reduces to the transcendental equation which for new
dimensionless variable W ≡ iwδ

for harmonic oscillations (8).

Consider the following cases.
1.
Let Im(W ) = 0, i.e. the frequency w is purely imaginary: w = iz.

3

Then the function in R.H.S. of eq. (9) has zero value for W = 0 and for

W > 0,

(z < 0) its derivative with respect to W has negative sign:

d R.H.S
dW

= W/2

1 − W/2 − (1 + W/2) exp (−W )

< 0

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

Thus this function is negative for W > 0. Consequently the equation (9),
where L.H.S. is positive for W > 0, has no solutions for W > 0,
(z < 0).
Thus there are no solutions for R(t) of the form

R ∼ exp (−zt), z < 0

- i.e there are no exponentially increasing with time t solutions.

So for Sommerfeld ball as for Sommerfeld sphere there are no exponen-

tially ”running away solutions”.

2.
Let Re(W ) = 0, W ≡ iZ, i.e. the frequency w is purely real number.
Then eq. (9) can be put in the form

iZ 5/k∗ − iZ 3/12 + Z 2/4 + 1 = exp (−iZ)(1 + iZ/2)2

(10)

Multiplication of (10) on its complex conjugate leads to the relation

It has the solution

(Z 5/k∗ − Z 3/12)2 = 0

Z = ±

k∗/12

q

Turning back to the eq.(10) with (12), we come to the result

Z 2/4 + 1 = exp (−iZ)(1 + iZ/2)2

Reducing the R.H.S. of (13) to the form

(Z 2/4 + 1) exp (−iZ + i2Φ),

tg(Φ) = Z/2

(11)

(12)

(13)

we get from (13)

Z = 2Φ, or tg(Z/2) = Z/2

(14)

So relations (14) and (12) taking together yield the solution of our problem:

if Z = Zn, n = 1, 2, 3, ... - the discrete solutions of the transcendental

eq. (14), then parameter k∗ must satisfy the condition

k∗

≡

mc2a

= (Zn)2

Thus for these frequencies (and values of parameter k∗ ) there are har-

monic oscillating solutions of ball equation (7), free of radiation damping.

This class of solutions is absent for Sommerfeld sphere.
On the other hand, taking

Z 5/k∗ → 0

(15)

one can try to ﬁnd weather there are the radiationless solutions ( for which
~Fself = 0 or
(11) due to (15) gives the immediate answer - there are no such solutions.

= 0) for the ball equation (7). Equation

R.H.S. of (9)

(cid:19)W =iZ

(cid:18)

Thus one can see that Sommerfeld ball and Sommerfeld sphere models
provide us with diﬀerent behavior of moving charged body. For the Sommer-
feld ball there are no ”radiationless” solutions but there are solutions with
not damped oscillations though the value of the self-force diﬀers from zero.

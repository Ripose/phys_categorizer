Abstract

Lorentz-Dirac (LD) equation [1],

We discuss the unstable character of the solu-
tions of the Lorentz-Dirac equation and stress
the need of methods like order reduction to
derive a physically acceptable equation of
motion. The discussion is illustrated with the
paradigmatic example of the non-relativistic
harmonic oscillator with radiation reaction.
We also illustrate removal of the noncasual
pre-acceleration with the introduction of a
small correction in the Lorentz-Dirac equa-
tion.

where a dot indicates derivative with respect
to the proper time τ ; f µ is the external 4-force
per unit mass and b = 2e2
3mc3 . Although the
LD equation is based in solid physical ground
(Special Relativity and Electrodynamics) it
has some unusual mathematical properties
that put some doubts about the suitability of
this equation to represent the motion equa-
tion of a charged particle with radiation reac-
tion. Since the LD equation is a third order
ordinary diﬀerential equation, not only the
initial position and velocity, but also the ini-
tial acceleration must be given to specify a
unique solution. Moreover, one has to de-
termine with an inﬁnity accuracy the initial
value of the acceleration that eliminates the
part of the solutions that grow exponentially
in time (“runaway” solution).

(n = 0, 1, . . .) is constructed:

Recently, Spohn [2] found that the physical
solutions of the LD equation lie on a critical
manifold in phase space that consists exclu-
sively of repelling ﬁxed points. On this criti-
cal surface the motion is free of runaway so-
lutions and is governed by an eﬀective second
order equation. If an initial condition slightly
oﬀ the critical surface is given, the solution
grows exponentially fast. This lack of stabil-
ity of solutions with respect to small varia-
tions of initial conditions means that the LD
equation does not represent a mathematically
well posed problem [3] and in consequence its
applicability is limited.

We note that in this approach only the usual
initial conditions (position and velocity) are
required and the equations for a ﬁnite n are
stable with respect to variations of initial con-
ditions.

Rohrlich [6], inspired on Landau [7], argues
that the original LD equation should be re-
placed by Eq.(3) as the exact equation of mo-
tion of a radiating point particle, since it is
of second order, satisﬁes the principle of iner-
tia, and the radiation reaction term vanishes
in the absence of an external force. This pre-
scription is based on physical arguments, but
only the confrontation with experimental re-
sults will establish its validity. For proposals
of experimental tests, see [2].

The purpose of this letter is to illustrate
the above discussion with the signiﬁcant ex-
ample of the non-relativistic one-dimensional
harmonic oscillator with radiation reaction.
This problem has an analytical solution that
can be used to construct the eﬀective sec-
ond order equation of motion on the above
mentioned critical surface. The successive
approximations scheme (2)–(4) and solutions

Diﬃculties also arise in the numerical so-
lution of the LD equation [4]. Even if one
knows the correct initial value of the accel-
eration, in the usual forward numerical in-
tegration the runaway contributions to the
solution grow extremely fast due to numeri-
cal errors. As an alternative, Aguirregabiria
[5] proposes a method of order reduction in
which Eq.(1) is substituted by a second or-
der equation of motion with no runaway so-
lutions. The explicit form of this second order
equation cannot be obtained in general, so a
series of successive approximations ¨xµ = ξµ

from direct numerical integration of the non-
relativistic LD equation can be confronted
with the exact solution. The study of this
example will show us the limitations of the
LD equation

to describe the motion of a charge particle
interacting with its own radiation (back reac-
tion). Also we shall discuss the addition of a
small correction term that eliminates the pre-
acceleration in the solutions to the LD equa-

tial acceleration given by Eq.(18) is used with
16 signiﬁcant ﬁgures, the runaway contribu-
tions make also the numerical solution useless
after a few time units.

Finally, in Figure 3 the solutions calculated
with the successive approximations (19) are
compared with the exact solution using initial
conditions x(0) = 1 and ˙x(0) = 0. Although
the convergence is slow, no instability is seen.
This example clariﬁes the uselessness of
Eq.(1) in practice. Even though, for very
special cases, some exact solutions of the LD
equation are known [9] for actual situations
one must rely on numerical solutions. But,
to eliminate the runaway components one
would have to know the exact initial condi-
tions and to perform the computations with
inﬁnite precision. The knowledge of the ex-

5

act initial conditions imposes a physically im-
possible condition to be achieved. Also, do
numerics with inﬁnite precision is not possi-
ble. Recently, Chicone et al [10] pointed out
that high order equations like Eq.(1) must be
viewed as an intermediate step in the deriva-
tion of the physically correct, second order
equation. A possible method to ﬁnd this
equations is the use of successive approxima-
tions. However, there is no guarantee of con-
vergence.

We would like to comment another unusual
feature of the LD equation, the phenomenon
of pre-acceleration. When the external force
is an explicit function of time, the solution of
the one-dimensional non-relativistic version
of Eq.(1) can be written as [9]

¨x(t) =

e−(t′−t)/bf (t′) dt′.

(21)

t

It follows from Eq.(21) that a nonzero ac-
celeration exists before the external force is
applied at t = 0, thus violating cusality.
In a nice monograph on the LD equation,
Yaghjian [8] carefully rederives the equation
of motion for the extended model of the elec-
tron as a charged insulating sphere of ra-
dius a. He shows that the multiplication of
the electromagnetic self force by a correction
function η(τ ) eliminates the pre-acceleration
from the solution to the original LD equation
without introducing false discontinuities in
velocity across τ = 0 or spurious delta func-
tions and their derivatives at τ = 0. The cor-
rection function increases monotonically from
zero to one in the time it takes light to travel
across the electron, and it approaches zero
like τ 2 or faster as τ approaches zero from

the positive (right) side. This modiﬁcation is
needed to ensure the validity of the Taylor ex-
pansion that is used in the evaluation of the
electromagnetic self force about present time
(τ ) of position, velocity and acceleration of
each element of charge at retarded time dur-
ing the interval 0 < τ < 2a/c. With this
correction, Eq.(21) is modiﬁed to

acceleration equals the external force per unit
mass when the external force is ﬁrst applied,
a result that Yaghjian shows is valid in gen-
eral. Figure 4 displays the curves of accelera-
tions calculated with Eq.(24) and Eq.(26) for
t0 = 2, t1 = 5, a = 1, and k = 0.1. When
η(t) reduces to 1, after t = t0 + 2a, both so-
lutions agree.

To summarize, the LD equation suﬀers
from two major problems: pre-acceleration
and runaway solutions. To have a physically
acceptable equation of motion two

approaches have been proposed.

In the
ﬁrst, we introduce a correction function mul-
tiplying the electromagnetic self-force term
in the original LD equation to eliminate the
pre-acceleration [8] and impose a boundary
condition to eliminate the runaway solution.
And in the second by an appropriate proce-
dure we substitute the third order diﬀerential
LD equation by an eﬀective second order dif-
ferential equation [7]. Rohrlich [6] advocate
to take this eﬀective second order equation

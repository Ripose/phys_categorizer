Abstract

Some connections between quantum mechanics and classical physics are ex-
plored. The Planck-Einstein and De Broglie relations, the wavefunction and its
probabilistic interpretation, the Canonical Commutation Relations and the Maxwell–
Lorentz Equation may be understood in a simple way by comparing classical elec-
tromagnetism and the photonic description of light provided by classical relativistic
kinematics. The method used may be described as ‘inverse correspondence’ since
quantum phenomena become apparent on considering the low photon number den-
sity limit of classical electromagnetism. Generalisation to massive particles leads
to the Klein–Gordon and Schr¨odinger Equations. The diﬀerence between the quan-
tum wavefunction of the photon and a classical electromagnetic wave is discussed
in some detail.

Introduction

The traditional way to teach quantum mechanics (QM) is to introduce ﬁrst the non-
relativistic theory. On the one hand there is the Schr¨odinger Equation [1] which resembles
the other partial diﬀerential equations of mathematical physics, and like them has certain
solutions, depending on the physical system under consideration and boundary condi-
tions. On the other hand, there is the physical interpretation of the wavefunction via
Born’s probabilistic postulate [2] and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Relations [3]. It is in
this second part that the conceptual diﬃculty of the subject resides and the borderline be-
tween physics and philosophy appears to be poorly deﬁned. The beginning student may
have diﬃculty bridging the gap between the mathematical aspect (represented by the
Schr¨odinger Equation, and its solutions, where many parallels may be found in classical
physics) and the physical interpretation of QM.

It is suggested here that an alternative approach is possible, one that follows closely
(and even, in a sense to be explained later, predates) the historical development of the
subject. Planck was led to introduce the constant of action, h, by considering the proper-
ties of electromagnetic radiation in thermal equilibrium [4], and the ﬁrst example of ‘wave
particle duality’ was Einstein’s introduction of the light quantum concept [5]. In both
cases the system considered was ultra-relativistic 1. The appearence of the constant h in
the non-relativistic Schr¨odinger Equation, may then appear to be somewhat mysterious.
The ﬁrst idea for the approach to QM adopted in this paper came from a reading of
Feynman’s popular book ‘QED’ [6], where the fundamental concepts of QM are explained
in terms of the interactions of photons and electrons. Feynman’s book presents many
examples drawn from physical optics, a subject treated in most textbooks in terms of
the classical wave theory of light. Contrary to the traditional approach then, QM will be
introduced here by way of the fully relativistic theory of free photons. The physical inter-
pretation will then be shown to arise naturally by requiring consistency of this photonic
(particle) description with the ‘wave’ description supplied by Classical Electromagnetism
(CEM).

A ﬁrst step in this direction has been taken in an earlier paper [7] by the present
author in which the Lorentz Transformation (LT) was derived on the basis of a few
simple postulates, without reference to light or CEM. The kinematics of the LT was
developed to show that consistency with CEM requires Einstein’s ‘light signals’ to be
interpreted as massless (or almost massless) particles, the ‘light quantum’, discovered
by Einstein, but in an, apparently, entirely diﬀerent context. Thus, in the approach of
Reference [7], the existence of photons is deduced from the correctness of Einstein’s second
postulate of Special Relativity: the constancy of the velocity of light, or alternatively,
Einstein’s second postulate, can be seen as a consequence of the light quantum concept.
The comparison between the particle and wave aspects of light is further developed in
the present paper, and is shown to lead in a direct way to many of the fundamental
concepts of QM. The theory is then generalised to particles of non-zero mass and the Klein
Gordon and Schr¨odinger Equations are derived. The diﬀerent physical interpretations of
1This terminology has two meanings in the present paper. Firstly, the photon velocity is evidently
not negligible, as compared to the velocity of light, as is assumed for massive particles in non-relativistic
quantum mechanics, and secondly, that space and time are treated on an equal footing in all equations.

1

the wavefunction of QM and the electromagnetic waves of CEM are also discussed in
connection with the photonic nature of light.

An eﬀort has been made throughout this paper to develop the subject in a logical
manner, stating everywhere the assumptions that are made, and building later results on
ones established earlier. Still, classical physics remains diﬀerent from quantum physics
and less fundamental.
In the appropriate limit, the former may be derived from the
latter, but the inverse procedure is not completely possible. Since the present paper
works from known results of classical physics towards quantum physics there must then
be, of necessity, a discontinuity in the argument. It will be clearly pointed out just where
this jump between the classical and quantum worlds is made, and where a new concept,
not derivable from those used in the preceding arguments, must be introduced. Later, a
logical bridge (without introducing any new concepts) will be built back from quantum
mechanics to CEM.

A related ‘historically correct’ introduction to QM has been proposed in a recent
paper [8] that emphasised rather the relation of QM to thermodynamics and relativity,
but still focused on the photonic description of light. A brief comment on this approach
is given in the last Section of this paper.

2 Planck’s Constant and the De Broglie Momentum-

Wavelength Relation

As ﬁrst proposed by Minkowski [9], to any physical object, O, of Newtonian mass, m,

may be associated an energy-momentum 4-vector, P , deﬁned as:

where the space-time 4-vector X, is deﬁned as:

P

≡

m

dX
dτ ≡

(

E

; px, py, pz)

(ct; x, y, z)

≡

and τ is the time observed in the rest frame of O (its proper time). If the inertial frame S’
is moving with uniform velocity βc relative to the frame S along the common x, x′ axis,
and Oy, Oy′ are also parallel, then the 4-vectors P , P ′ as observed in S, S’ are related by
the LT equations:

where

As discussed in Reference [7], P , is well-deﬁned in the limit m
0, so that an energy-
momentum 4-vector may also be associated with the massless photon. In this case the

A plane electomagnetic wave, which will here be associated with a large number of pho-
tons, each having the same 4-vector, Pγ, was discussed by Einstein in his original paper on
Special Relativity [10]. By considering the LT of space-time co-ordinates and electric and
magnetic ﬁeld components, the following equations were obtained for the transformation
of the frequency, ν, and the total energy, ET , of a plane electromagnetic wave2:

ν, ET refer to S and ν′, E′
constitute the ‘electromagnetic wave’ transform according to:

T to S’. Using Eqns.(2.6),(2.7) the energies of the photons that

If nγ is the total number of photons in the ‘light complex’ considered by Einstein then
ET = nγEγ, and Eqn.(2.9) follows trivially from Eqn.(2.10). It also follows from Eqns.(2.8)
and (2.10) that:

Calling the Lorentz invariant constant in Eqn.(2.11), h, then gives:

(2.9)

(2.12)

So the constant h is identical to Planck’s constant. The existence of the quantum of
action, h, is then seen to arise from the consistency between the relativistic kinematics
of photons, considered to be massless particles, described by Eqns(2.3)-(2.6) and the
relativistic Doppler eﬀect for classical electromagnetic waves, Eqn(2.8). Thus, in a certain
sense, a fundamental equation of QM results here from the fusion of two areas of classical
physics.

It should be noted that the photon concept is essential in the derivation of Eqn.(2.12)
since Eqn(2.10) describes the kinematics of a massless particle. The ‘quantum of energy’
that must be introduced in the derivation of Planck’s radiation formula speciﬁes only the
manner in which black-body radiation is emitted or absorbed, not how it propagates in
space-time. As the ﬁerce debate around the Bohr-Kramers-Slater proposal [11] showed,
it was, at ﬁrst, not at all evident that the ‘quantum of energy’ could be naively identiﬁed
with a particle [12].

The equation (2.12), together with the physical interpretation of Eγ as the energy of
a ‘light quantum’ had already been discovered earlier in 1905 by Einstein [5]. Given the
apparent simplicity of the above argument, one may ask why Einstein did not notice how
his Eqns.(2.8),(2.9) may be interpreted in terms of light quanta, given his knowledge of
Eqn.(2.12). He limited himself to the remark:

2More details of this derivation are given in Section 7 below

3

‘ It is remarkable that the energy and frequency of a light complex vary with the state of

motion of the observer in accordance with the same law ’

Actually, however, Einstein did not know, in 1905, the LT equations for the energy-
momentum 4-vector (Eqns.(2.3)-(2.6)) which were ﬁrst written down in the following year
by Planck [13]. Denoting the modulus of the 3-momentum vector of the photon by pγ, it
follows from Eqn.(2.7) that Eγ = pγc. Substituting this relation in (2.12) and using the
deﬁnition of wavelength λ = c/ν, gives the de Broglie relation [14]:

The equivalent equation relating momentum and frequency:

was actually discovered by Einstein in 1909 [15], though not explicitly written down as
in Eqn(2.14)3. This was ﬁrst done by Stark [16]. Further discussion of this point, in
connection with Reference [8], may be found in Section 7 below.

3 The Photon Wave Function and the Born Proba-

bilistic Interpretation

From the expression for the energy density of a plane electromagnetic wave:

ρW =

~E2 + ~B2
8π

F = cρW

Prad = 2ρW

the photon interpretation gives immediately Poynting’s formula for the energy ﬂow F per
unit area per unit of time:

as well as the formula for the radiation pressure Prad of a plane wave at normal incidence
on a perfect reﬂector:

Each photon annihilated by, and each photon created by the electrons in the reﬂector
transfers a momentum, pγ, perpendicular to its surface. The number of photons incident,
per unit area, per unit time, is F/Eγ. The total momentum transferred, per unit area,
per unit time, is then pγ(F/Eγ) = F/c = ρW . Because of the perfectly reﬂecting nature
of the mirror, no net energy is absorbed, so an equal number of photons are re-emitted ,
3See the excellent scientiﬁc biography of Einstein by A.Pais [17] for a full account of the reticence
towards the light quantum concept displayed by the physics community in the early years the last century.
This was, in large part, due to the enormous respect paid at that time to CEM. That the ‘wave’ properties
of this theory : reﬂection, refraction, interference and diﬀraction are indeed consequences of the quantum
mechanics of photons was not recognised until much later. See, for example, Reference [6] . Indeed it is
clear that Einstein himself, although the originator of the quantum theory of light, regarded it rather as
a phenomenological, heuristic, model rather than a complete and fundamental theory.

4

also transferring ρW units of momentum, per unit area, per unit time, hence Eqn.(3.3).
The classical result for radiation pressure, obtained in this way, requires the incident
and reﬂected photons to have the same energy. For optical photons interacting with
the electrons in the conduction band of a metallic reﬂector, this is expected to be a
good approximation, the momenta of the photons being taken up by the atomic lattice
as a whole, with negligible recoil energy.
In general however, the energies of incident
and reﬂected photons are diﬀerent. This change in energy for the case of Compton
scattering of X-rays was crucial for the general acceptance of the validity of the photon
concept [12, 18, 19].

A plane electromagnetic wave of wavelength λ, moving in free space parallel to the

positive x direction in the frame S may be written as:

where:

The time-averaged energy density per unit volume, ¯ρW , is:

Assuming now that the wave consists of a beam of photons of energy hν moving parallel
to the positive x direction, the average number density of photons, ¯ργ, in the wave is
¯ρW /hν, so that, from Eqn.(3.6):

This is the point at which the leap across the chasm separating the classical and
quantum worlds is made, and where as previously mentioned, a new physical concept must
be introduced. The use of a complex exponential to represent a classical electromagnetic
wave, as in Eqns(3.4) and (3.5) is quite conventional. The wave may be associated with
either the real or the imaginary part. On the other hand, for the description of light
in QM, the use of the complete complex exponential is mandatory. Some a posteriori
justiﬁcation for this will be given below, but here the complex exponential is introduced
as a necessary, but a priori unjustiﬁed, assumption. The second crucial point is to use the
deﬁnition of wavelength together with Eqns(2.12) and (2.13) to replace, in the complex
exponential the ‘wave’ parameter λ by the ‘particle’ parameters Eγ and pγ. The parameter
c that describes both the speed of propagation of electromagnetic waves and the velocity
of photons is a part of both descriptions. Because the equations of QM then contain
only particle parameters, they describe, at the most fundmental level the behaviour of
particles, not of waves. Thus the ‘complex exponential describing photons’ is obtained:

The function up will now be called the wavefunction of the photon. As will be shown
below, many key concepts and equations of QM may be derived from its mathematical
properties. Now Eqn.(3.7) may be written as:

interpretation [2] the wavefunction up. It is derived by consistency with the energy density
(3.1) of a classical electromagnetic wave in the low photon density limit. Introducing now

This is an example of the general property of quantum wavefunctions that they are eigen-
functions of operators corresponding to conserved (time independent) physical quantities
of the system that they describe. In CEM the exponential functions in Eqns.(3.4),(3.5)
may be replaced, without loss of generality, by real sinusoidal functions (as done, for exam-
ple, in Reference [10]). The wave function up of QM derived by ‘inverse correspondence’
from Eqns.(3.4),(3.5) necessarily contains, however, an exponential function of complex
argument. Only in this way can the eigenvalue equations (3.13) and (3.14), corresponding
to the ﬁxed momentum and energy, respectively, of the free photon, be realised. It may
also be remarked that the diﬀerence in sign in the deﬁnitions of the operators
in
Eqns(3.11) and (3.12) is a consequence of the Minkowski metric of the four-vector product
between the space-time and energy-momentum vectors in the complex exponential factor
of Eqn(3.8).

Px and

E

In the above discussion, the photon wave function (3.8) has the form of a plane wave.
Strictly speaking, such a wave function (for massless or massive particles) cannot be
interpreted probabilistically according to Born’s ansatz as a spatial wavefunction since a
photon with such a wavefunction has the same probability to be found at any value of
x. Indeed the wave function of Eqn(3.8) is not square integrable and so cannot yield a
normalised probability density. However, Eqn.(3.10) does give correctly the probability
to ﬁnd a photon in unit volume in the inﬁnitely long, but very diﬀuse, beam of photons
that is the low density limit of an electromagnetic plane wave. A further complication in
the case of a photon it that, due to its massless nature, it is possible neither to assign
to it a conserved probability current, nor to assign a quantum mechanical operator to its
spatial position [20, 21]. This has lead to much discussion in the literature and text books
of the ‘non-localisability’ of photons [22]. Whether this is a real problem, going beyond
the non-localisability of any particle (massive or massless) with a plane wavefunction is
debateable, but beyond the scope of the present paper. From the practical, experimental,
viewpoint it is evident that photons can be spatially localised as well (or as badly) as any
other type of elementary particle.

is a consequence of Newtons’s First Law, true in both classical mechanics and QM. The
photons in a classical electromagnetic plane wave have ﬁxed energy and momentum in
classical mechanics and are in eigenstates of energy and momentum in QM. A physical
object is at a ﬁxed position (or in an eigenstate of the spatial position operator) only in its
rest frame. Such a frame does not exist for a massless particle, which explains the absence
of the operator
for such particles mentioned above. Given the intrinsic mutability of
time an ‘eigenstate of time’ seems to be both a logical and physical impossiblity.

may be used to derive the energy-time Uncertainty Relation:

Otherwise the physical meaning of the energy-time Canonical Commutation Relation (4.4)
is somewhat obscure. Unlike Eqn.(4.3) that was crucial for Heisenberg’s ﬁrst calculation
of atomic transition rates [24], Eqn(4.4) as no evident physical application.

In the above discussion, only plane polarised waves with electric vector parallel to the

repeating the above derivation for other choices of polarisation of the plane electromag-
netic wave that gives, on replacing λ by Eγ, pγ, the wave function of the photon.

5 The Klein–Gordon and Schr¨odinger Equations

Noting that the phase of the exponential in Eqn.(3.8) is a Lorentz invariant quantity,
being simply proportional to the 4-vector product of the space-time and momentum-
energy vectors, that is equally valid for massless and massive particles, the above consid-
erations are easily generalised to the case of the latter. Using instead of Eγ = pγc the
general energy-momentum relation for massive particles:

together with Eqns.(3.11)-(3.14) the Maxwell–Lorentz Equation (4.9) generalises to the
Klein Gordon–Equation :

6 Wavefunctions of Free and Conﬁned Photons and
Their Relation to Classical Electromagnetic Waves

The wavefunction describing a free photon, Eqn(3.8), can be used to construct both
Stationary wavefunctions where a photon is conﬁned to a limited spatial region, and
classical electromagnetic waves. In the latter case however, it will be seen that the physical
interpretation becomes quite diﬀerent to that of the quantum wavefunction.

E is an eigenfunction of the photon energy Eγ. It is not,
however, an eigenfunction of the photon momentum p. Eqn(6.3) shows that a photon in
this state has equal amplitudes for photons with px =

describe, for example, a photon in a cavity with perfect reﬂectors, perpendicular to the
(2n + 1)h/2p where n is any integer. This Stationary wavefunction is

The function χCP W , with the replacements pγ →
hc/λ, as in the last member
of Eqn(6.4) yields a typical plane wave solution of Maxwell’s Equations in CEM. This
equation is then the bridge back across the chasm from the quantum to the classical
world that was leapt, in the opposite sense, by the introduction of Eqn(3.8). Just as
the quantum wavefunction is only a meaningful physical concept in the limit of very low
photon density, then, as will now be discussed, the function χCP W is meaningful only in the
opposite limit of very high photon density. χCP W is an eigenfunction of neither Eγ nor pγ
and is a real, not a complex function, as are the wavefunctions of a free or conﬁned photon
in Eqns(3.8) and (6.3) respectively. This illustrates the essential diﬀerence beween the
) wave χCP W and the wave function up of QM. It is common,
classical electromagnetic (
waves in just the exponential form (3.4),(3.5) with

with a real sinusoidal wave. The electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths in CEM are, of
course, real quantities. Indeed, if a suitably orientated antenna is placed at any position
in the wave χCP W then the time dependence of the induced voltage determines the phase
of the electric vector at that position. Such a classical wave, produced for example by a
dipole antenna, is always, then, represented by a real sinusoidal function, although, for
mathematical convenience only, the wave may be described by the real (or i times the
imaginary) part of a complex exponential. The time average of (χCP W )2, at any position,
is half the mean photon density, ¯ργ which is related to the classical mean energy density
¯ρW by ¯ρW = hν ¯ργ. In a typical situation where the physics is well represented by CEM,
the value of ¯ργ∆V , where ∆V is the volume element of interest, is much larger than
unity. For example, consider a radio transmitter of frequency 1 MHz and a power of 1

The relation of QM and CEM has been discussed in a similar way to above by Saku-
rai [25]. A suggested condition for the validity of CEM was that the average energy

Thus the number of photons in the volume (λ/2π)3 must be much larger than unity. In

The classical limit can also be discussed by use of second quantised ﬁeld theory. As

It is clear from (6.6) that for a single photon

discusses how Eqn.(6.6) can be interpreted in such a way as to yield a momentum-space
Uncertainty Relation similar to Eqn.(4.5) for a localised

7 Summary and Conclusions

In this paper a method has been suggested for introducing the basic concepts of QM,
not, as is done in the majority of text books on the subject, via the Schr¨odinger Equation
and the non-relativistic theory, but rather by re-interpreting the equations of CEM (a
subject well-known by the majority of students confronting QM for the ﬁrst time) to take
into account the existence of photons, massless particles described by classical relativistic
kinematics. Historically, Planck’s constant [4] and the light quantum [5] were discovered
by considerations based on the properties of cavity radiation and the photoelectric eﬀect,
respectively. An alternative way of deriving the Planck-Einstein relation, Eqn.(2.12), is
via the photonic description of light in Special Relativity and CEM. Einstein’s second
postulate in his Special Relativity paper [10] concerning the constancy of the velocity of
light is a direct consequence [29, 7] of the LT, on the assumption that light consists of
massless (or almost massless) particles: photons. Comparing the LT of the frequency of
a plane
wave (Eqn.(2.8)) with that of the energy-momentum 4-vector of a photon,
Eqn.(2.10), then leads directly to the Planck-Einstein relation: Eγ = hν.

The wavefunction of the photon and its Born probabilistic interpretation may be
wave. The
introduced by considering the low photon density limit of a classical
wavefunction is shown to be an eigenfunction of the quantum mechanical operators corre-
sponding to the momentum and energy of the photon. The properties of the wavefunction

of a free photon are then shown to yield the Canonical Commutation Relations of QM,
and hence the Heisenberg Uncertainty Relation, as well as the Maxwell–Lorentz equa-
tion. Generalisation of the Maxwell–Lorentz equation to the case of massive particles
enables the derivation of the Klein–Gordon and Schr¨odinger Equations. The distinction
between the quantum wavefunctions of free photons, Stationary photon wavefunctions
waves is discussed. The classical wave appears in the high particle den-
and classical
sity limit of quantum mechanics. Classical
waves can always be represented by real
functions, whereas quantum wavefunctions are, necessarily, complex in order to represent
eigenfunctions of the operators of conserved quantities.

It should be emphasised that, just as a large part of the motivation of the present
paper resulted from ideas suggested by a reading of Reference [6], Feynman’s approach
to relativistic quantum mechanics has been followed throughout this paper. In the more
conventional quantum ﬁeld theory of Dirac [26] photons are described in terms of ‘second-
quantised’ electromagnetic ﬁeld operators. However, all physical results of this formalism
are equivalent to those of the Feynman diagram approach [27] where only ﬁrst-quantised
(‘c-number’, in Dirac’s terminology) wave functions, as discussed in the present paper,
appear in the invariant amplitude for any physical process4. It should also be stressed
that, nowhere in the present paper, is the dynamics of photon production and destruc-
tion, described in second-quantised ﬁeld theory by creation and annihilation operators,
discussed. The quantum mechanical principles follow solely from consideration of the
kinematical properties of free photons. Indeed dynamics occurs in the paper only, under
the guise of energy conservation, in the discussion of the Schr¨odinger Equation in Section
5.

There is an appreciable overlap between the ideas presented in the present paper and
those contained in a recent paper of Margaritondo [8]. For example, the same simple
derivation of the law of radiation pressure, using the photon concept, given above, was
presented. The main emphasis of Reference [8] was, however, on Einstein’s original dis-
covery of the light quantum concept by comparing the entropy of a dilute gas with that
of cavity radiation with frequencies within the range of validity of Wien’s Law. Einstein’s
remark concerning the similarity of the transformation laws of the frequency of electro-
magnetic waves and of the energy of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, quoted in Section 2 above,
was also mentioned. Margaritondo suggests that Einstein may have (though tacitly) also
deduced the existence of photons from this similarity, and this may have given him con-
ﬁdence to publish the ‘revolutionary’ paper in which the existence of light quanta was
actually proposed [5]. To support this argument, Margaritondo surmises that Einstein
interpreted his formula for the energy of an electromagnetic wave according to Eqn(2.10)
above which describes the transformation of the energy of a photon. A careful reading of
Einstein’s Special Relativity paper [10] shows, however, that although the transformation
law of the ‘light complex’ considered is indeed Eqn(2.9), which seems, to modern eyes,
trivially related to Eqn(2.10), Einstein actually derived this relation by a completely dif-
ferent route that has no obvious connection with the photon concept. The total energy
inside a spherical surface, drawn inside a plane electromagnetic wave, as seen by two dif-
ferent observers, one at rest and the other in motion, was considered. In Eqn(2.9), ET and
E′
T actually represent the energy content of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, within this spherical

surface, as seen by the two observers. To arrive at Eqn(2.9), both the Loretntz transfor-
mation of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds as well as the length contraction of the sphere,
as viewed by one of the observers, was taken into account. Thus the increase of the energy
due to the transformation of the electromagnetic ﬁelds was partially compensated by the
length contraction eﬀect. It seems unlikely that Einstein would have presented such an
intricate derivation if he was aware that Eqn(2.9) may be almost trivially derived by use
of the photon concept. In fact, as already pointed out in Section 2 above, Einstein was
not aware, in 1905, of the LT laws for the energy-momentum four-vectors, Eqns(2.3)-(2.6)
above. Indeed, if Einstein had had a full understanding of both relativistic kinematics and
the photon concept at this time, it would have been unnecessary to pose the constancy
of the velocity of light as a separate axiom in Special Relativity, since it is a necessary
consequence of the identiﬁcation of light as massless particles [29, 7]. In fact, as discussed
in considerable detail in Reference [17], Einstein’s attitude towards the photon concept
(i.e. considering light to fundamentally be a particle) remained ambiguous until the end
of his life. Indeed, he rather considered ﬁelds (physical entities existing continously in
space-time) to be the most fundamental concepts in physics. In fact, Eqn(2.9) was derived
from consideration of electromagnetic ﬁelds, not light quanta. It is not for nothing, then,
that the ‘light quantum’ paper describes, according to Einstein, not a ‘theory’ but rather
a: ‘... Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light’.

Finally, the remark may be made, as previously pointed out by Feynman [6] and other
authors adopting a similar approach [30], that the so called ‘classical wave theory of light’
developed in the early part of the 19th Century by Young, Fresnel and others is QM as it
applies to photons interacting with matter. Similarly Maxwell’s theory of CEM is most
economically regarded as simply the limit of QM when the number of photons involved in a
physical measurement becomes very large. Indeed, in this paper, QM has been understood
by ‘inverse correspondence’, considering the opposite (small photon number) limit of
CEM. Thus experiments performed with light by physicists during the last century, and
even earlier, were QM experiments, now interpreted via the wavefunctions of QM, but then
in terms of ‘light waves’. The latter may be derived from the former by the replacements:
p
h/ν. The ‘particle’ parameters p, E of the wave function are replaced
by the ‘wave’ parameters λ, ν, and h disappears from the equations, yielding the classical
wave theory of light. The predictions for, say, interference and diﬀraction, remain however,
fundamentally, those of QM. It is in this sense, as mentioned in the introduction, that the
quantum theory of light predates the discoveries of Planck and Einstein. They actually
discovered that light consists of particles, that Special Relativity theory shows to have
kinematical properties reassuringly close to those of any other physical objects of classical
physics. The essential and mysterious aspects of QM, as embodied in the wavefunction
(superposition, interference) were already well known, in full mathematical detail, almost
a hundred years earlier!

An attempt has been made to ﬁnd a consistent and logical form for relativistic temperature
transformation. Other works in this area have been discussed. Our approach is based on the kinetic
theory of ideal gases.

INTRODUCTION

II. HISTORICAL REVIEW

According to Galilean Transformation (GT), the speed
of light is diﬀerent in two inertial frames, moving with
constant velocity with respect to each other. In the late
18th and early 19th century, there was considerable ev-
idence supporting the idea that the speed of light is an
invariant quantity with respect to all inertial observers.
In 1905, Einstein [1] made the ground breaking discov-
ery that when transforming physical quantities from one
inertial observer’s frame to another, the Lorentz transfor-
mations must be used so that the speed of light remains
an invariant quantity. The principle of relativity modi-
ﬁed the Newton’s laws of motion and in a sense uniﬁed
concepts like space and time. Since then, much eﬀort has
been devoted to studying the relativistic forms of other
laws of physics. Many authors have tried to modify other
ﬁelds, such as thermodynamics, to render it compatible
with the relativity theory.
Generally, quantities are transformed in any ﬁeld of
physics by presuming invariance of some basic quanti-
ties or covariance of the form of laws in that discipline
under Lorentz transformation. For example electric and
magnetic ﬁelds are transformed by assuming covariance
of Maxwell equations. For obtaining relativistic transfor-
mation of temperature, an important question is: What
should be assumed invariant under Lorentz transforma-
tion?! The issue has been considered since the birth of
the relativity theory by famous scientists such as Planck,
Einstein and many others. Due to the lack of distinct ex-
perimental evidence, no consensus has yet been reached.
In this paper we start with a rather short historical re-
view (for complete reviews see the references section),
and then we try to drive our transformation from a new
point of view.
Our notation is as follows: symbols T ,P ,Q,S,U and W
are used for temperature, pressure, heat, entropy, inter-
nal energy and work, respectively.

Einstein and Planck [2, 3] were the ﬁrst who proposed
a transformation for temperature. They applied prin-
ciple of least action to a moving black-body cavity and
assumed the ﬁrst and the second laws of thermodynamics
(1), (2) to be covariant:

dU = dQ′ + W

dQ = T dS

and they argued the following set of transformations:

T = T ′/γ

Q = Q′/γ

S = S′

P = P ′

where prime indicates, the measurements made in the
proper frame of reference that is moving with constant
velocity −→v with respect to a stationary reference frame
and γ is:

A few years later, a new transformation of temperature
was derived by Eddington [4] and Blanusa [5] based on
covariance of the second law of thermodynamics (2).
In 1963, Ott [6] provided a critical overview of the sub-
ject and asserted that the transformations, derived in
[4, 5], by Eddington and Balnusa are the correct trans-
formations for thermodynamic quantities. These are:

T = γT ′

Q = γQ′

S = S′

P = P ′

,

However, Landsberg [7, 8] stressed that the thermody-
namic quantities that are statistical in nature, namely
T, S, U should not be expected to change for an observer
who judges the center of mass to be undergoing a uniform

motion. This approach, leads to the conclusion that some
thermodynamic relationships such as the second law (2)
are not covariant and results in the following equations:

γQ = T dS

Q = Q′/γ

P = P ′

T = γaT ′

Landsberg and Ott views, respectively.
The proposed transformations for the temperature have
been discussed by many authors. Here we brieﬂy review
some of them.
In 1967, Moller
[13] called Ott’s transformation as the
correct formula. He asserted that the wrong formula
had been accepted for 56 years.
Landsberg pointed out that Ott’s view as expressed in
(6) requires force to be redeﬁned, a requirement which
is diﬃcult for many to accept [14].
Shizhi stated that the diﬀerent formulations are de-
scribing the same physical quantities and are therefore
compatible. He believes that the diﬀerence between
Einstein’s and Planck’s opinions from one hand and
Ott’s from the other, depends on the selection of frame
of reference [15] .
The kinetic theory of ideal gases has been the basis of
some additional work on this subject.
In these works
other relationships have been proposed [9, 10, 11, 12].

III. DERIVATION

The authors of this paper take the appropriate deﬁ-
nition of the relativistic temperature to be one that is
based on the kinetic theory of ideal gases. We presume
average energy in any frame of reference to be related to
temperature by Boltzmann probability distribution.
First we derive the relativistic equipartition theorem. Ac-
cording to Boltzmann probability distribution for a clas-
sical (classic vs. quantum) ideal gas in a thermal bath,
average energy is related to reservoir temperature as be-
low: ( β= 1

IV. CONCLUSION

objects appear hotter to stationary observers. This is in
agreement with Ott’s view.
At the present time no temperature transformation has
been agreed upon. To reach consensus, it seems neces-
sary that ﬁrm experimental evidence is obtained.
We would like to thank Mr. Ardeshir Eftekharzadeh for
useful discussions and help in preparing this document.

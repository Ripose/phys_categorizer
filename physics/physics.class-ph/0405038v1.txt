dox in the framework of the Special and
General Theories of Relativity

Abstract

In this paper we treat the so called clock paradox in an analytical
way. The rest clock is denoted as (1), the to–and–fro moving clock
is (2), the inertial frame in which (1) is at rest in its origin and (2)
moves is I and, ﬁnally, the accelerated frame in which (2) is at rest
in its origin and (1) moves forward and backward is A. We will deal
with the following questions: I) According to the point of view of I,
when (2) and (1) reunite, they age diﬀerently, i.e.
the proper time
interval of (2) is shorter than that of (1). The usual special relativistic
time dilation formula accounts for this eﬀect when the acceleration of
(2) is neglected. Does a ﬁnite value of the force F acting upon (2)
preserve this situation, both qualitatively and quantitatively? We will
use the hyperbolic motion of the Special Theory of Relativity in order
to answer this question. II) Is this eﬀect an absolute one, i.e. does
the accelerated observer A comoving with (2) obtain the same results
as that in I, both qualitatively and quantitatively? We will use the
General Theory of Relativity and, again, a ﬁnite value of the force F
felt by (2) in order to answer this question.

Introduction

In this paper we wish to quantitatively examine in detail the so called clock
paradox by accounting for the eﬀects of the ﬁniteness of the force F which
accelerates and decelerates the moving clock which will conventionally be
denoted as (2). The Special and General Theories of Relativity will be
used. The role of ﬁnite acceleration in the twin paradox has recently been
investigated in [1].

An unidimensional motion will be considered in which the moving clock
starts its motion with zero initial velocity from the origin of the inertial

1

frame I in which the rest clock, denoted conventionally as (1), is located.
After the velocity V is reached, F is switched oﬀ, (2) persists in its rectilinear
uniform motion until F is switched again on, but in the opposite direction.
Then, (2) is decelerated, stops and inverts its motion until the velocity −V
is reached. At this point F is switched again oﬀ, (2) moves uniformly with
constant speed −V until F is restored in the original direction so that, when
(2) stops, it meets (1) again and they compare their readings.

What is the experimental status of the clock paradox? Some experiments
with elementary particles have been carried out until now. It must be noted
that in all of them only the predictions of the inertial observer I have been
tested, not those of the accelerated one A which is comoving with the mov-
ing particles. The celebrated experiment of the circling muons at CERN [2]
refers to a scenario in which the moving particles comes back periodically to
the same point following a circular unif orm1 motion and their lifetimes are
measured by an inertial observer I. But, in this case, the spacetime metric
of the accelerated frame, according to the General Theory of Relativity, is
diﬀerent from that of the rectilinear motion which is diagonal, as we will
see. The so-called vector potential, related to the oﬀ–diagonal elements of
the metric, occurs and, as shown in [3] at pag. 297–298, it is its eﬀect that
makes the predictions of the accelerated observer identical to those of the
inertial observer, so that, if we had been able to test the predictions of the
accelerated observer we would expect to ﬁnd no diﬀerence with respect to
those of I. In the case of a rectilinear motion there is no any experiment
which tests a scenario like that involved in the to–and–fro journey of the ac-
celerated clock; the observed2 dilation of the lifetime of muons in the cosmic
rays which reach the sea level before decaying [4] does not imply a return
of the muons to some point of reference in which their motion has started
to be analyzed. Moreover, no external force acts on the cosmic rays muons
whose motion is rectilinear and uniform, i.e. an one–way non—accelerated
motion occurs in this case which cannot be assumed as an experimental test
of the clock paradox in the case of rectilinear accelerated motion.

In general, by assuming inﬁnite accelerations (or no accelerations at all3)
for the accelerated clock (2), it can be obtained that (2) does lag behind the

1Note that, in this case, no acceleration along the direction of motion exists as, instead,

is the case of the rectilinear accelerated motion.

2Again, from the point of view of I.
3Indeed, it is possible to imagine a situation with one observer at rest and two oppo-
sitely moving inertial observers which encounter each other at a certain spacetime event
in which no acceleration occurs at all. By accounting for the time ‘jump’ it is possible to
obtain the desired absolute diﬀerent aging at the reunion with the rest clock [7].

inertial clock (1) when they reunite and compare their readings and that this
asymmetric eﬀect is an absolute one. The paradoxical symmetric outcome
would come, instead, from an uncorrect application of the Special Theory
of Relativity to the motion of (2) in the sense that the so called time ‘jump’
in the time of (1) as measured by (2) during its inertial motion must be
considered as well in order to obtain the desired result (see Subsection 3.2.2).
Instead, if it is not accounted for, the paradoxical symmetric situation comes
out. If the retardation of (2) with respect to (1), measured when they reunite
again in order to compare the readings of their displays, had to be considered
as an absolute eﬀect, both the inertial observer and the accelerated one
should agree not only that the non–inertial clock lags behind the inertial
clock, but also the magnitude of such an eﬀect should be the same. We will
investigate quantitatively if and how this feature is modiﬁed by accounting
for the ﬁnite force experienced by (2). The motion will be described both
in the inertial frame I, in which (1) is at rest while (2) moves according to
the special relativistic hyperbolic motion, and in the accelerated frame A
comoving with (2) in which the latter one is constantly at rest and (1) moves
in a way which will be derived in the framework of the General Theory of
Relativity. In general, t will denote the proper time of the clock which is at
rest in a given frame and τ the proper time of the clock which is seen to be
in motion in the same frame.

The proper time interval of the moving particle can be written as

The proper time of eq.(6) can be thought either as measured by a standard
clock comoving with the accelerated particle in such a way that it does not
feel the acceleration, or as the sum over a set of readings in instantaneous
inertial frames comoving with the particle.
It is interesting to note that
eq.(6) does not depend explicitly on the acceleration of the moving particle,
but only on its velocity which, however, contains the force per unit mass g,
as can be noted by eq.(4).

2.2 The motion of the clock (2) with respect to the clock (1)

The results of the previous section will now be used in order to describe the
motion of the clock (2) with respect to the clock (1). In this case t is the
proper time τ (1) of the clock (1), which is at rest in I, while τ denotes the
proper time τ (2) of the moving clock (2).

2.2.1 From t = t0 to t = t1

In this stage

• g > 0

• x(t) > 0

• v(t) > 0

• x(t0) = 0

• x(t1) = λ1

• v(t0) = 0

• v(t1) = V

i.e. the clock (2) starts moving from the origin with zero initial velocity and
is accelerated to a velocity V which is reached at t = t1 in λ1. From eq.(2)
it can be obtained

vanish.

3 The point of view of the accelerated clock

Does the observer comoving with (2) obtain the same results of (1) in I seen
in the previous Section? It has been shown that it is possible to preserve
the absolute diﬀerential aging of the two clocks when no accelerations at all
[7]) by using three inertial observers. What happens if a
occur (see, e.g.
ﬁnite acceleration felt by (2) is taken into account when the point of view
of (2) is considered? In this Section we will try to answer this question by
using the formalism of the General Theory of Relativity.

3.1 The equations of motion in an accelerated frame

Let us consider the generic motion of a body with respect to an inertial
frame whose spacetime coordinates will be now denoted as (X, Y, Z, T ). It
is possible to construct a frame of reference which is the relativistic analogue
of a classical rigid6 frame of Cartesian axes following the body in its motion,
so that the latter is constantly situated at the origin of this frame of reference
[3]. It will be denoted as A and its spacetime coordinates will be (x, y, z, t). It
can be constructed from the successive inﬁnitesimal Lorentz transformations
without rotations of the spatial axes which determine the successive inertial

6A system of reference is called rigid if the space distance σ between two reference
points, as measured by standard measuring–rods at rest in the system, is constant in
time. In this case (dσ)2 = (dx)2 + (dy)2 + (dz)2 and the coordinates x, y, z are Cartesian
and have a metric meaning.

frames that are momentarily rest systems of the moving particle. It turns
out that the coordinate clock located at the origin is a standard clock, i.e.
t = τ
is the proper time of the moving body on which the frame
A is constructed and which is located at its origin. For a hyperbolic motion
along the x axis the transformation between the inertial frame and A is

3.2 The motion of the clock (1) with respect to the clock (2)

The results of the previous section will now be used in order to describe
the motion of the clock (1) with respect to the clock (2). In this case t is
the proper time τ (2) of the clock (2), which is now constantly at rest in the
origin of A, while τ denotes the proper time τ (1) of the moving clock (1)

3.2.1 From t = t0 to t = t1

In this stage

• g > 0

• x(t) < 0

• v(t) < 0

• x(t0) = 0

16

• x(t1) = −l1

• v(t0) = 0

• v(t1) = −V

i.e. the clock (1) starts moving from the origin with zero initial velocity and
is accelerated to a velocity −V which is reached at t = t1. From eqs.(41)-(42)
and eq.(44) one gets

It allows to preliminarily note that, for a ﬁnite value of g, neither l1 = 0 nor
it is inﬁnite. Note that, for small values of V with respect to c, it can be
obtained

as in the Newtonian case. The correct value of l1 satisfying eq.(53), which
admits four mathematical solutions, can be obtained by considering the
solution that yields just the Newtonian limit and satisﬁes the condition

mathematically correct, the expression for l1, and of similar lengths in the
following sections, may lead to ambiguities in its physical interpretation
because of the diﬃculties of treating the simultaneity in the accelerated
frames.

important to note that the results of eqs.(55)-(56) are diﬀerent from those
q
of eqs.(7)-(10) obtained when the hyperbolic motion of A was viewed from
the inertial frame I. It should be interesting to compare eqs.(55)-(56) with
(8.190), pag. 295 of [3]. The relation

(cid:1)

(cid:21)

(cid:20)

holds there, as well, but the results of the motion of (2) with respect to (1)
in I are used for the explicit expression of τ1 − τ0.

3.2.2 The inertial motion from t1 to t2

In this stage

• g = 0

• x(t) < 0

• v(t) < 0

• x(t1) = −l1

• x(t2) = −l2

• v(t1) = −V

• v(t2) = −V

i.e. at t1 the force is switched oﬀ and the clock (1) moves uniformly from
−l1 to −l2 with constant velocity −V . Let us, now, determine the relation
of the time of the clock (2) with the time of the clock (1). During this step

19

the frame comoving with (2) is an inertial one and can be denoted as I
then I and I

are related by the usual Lorentz formulas

′

(cid:1)

(cid:0)
′
in which X, T refer to I and x, t refer to I
. Let T be the instant of time at
which the inertial trip of (2) as viewed by (1) in I ends: during it (2) covers
a span of ∆X = V T . According to I
, which, of course, uses a diﬀerent
simultaneity axis, the instant of time, in I, which is simultaneous to the
event of the end of the inertial trip is ˜T < T (See Fig. 7 of [7]). Then,
according to the usual formula for time dilation between inertial frames, the
time interval of the inertial trip, according to I

, is

′

′

′

where ∆T = T − ˜T . Indeed, the time interval of I which is simultaneous to
during the inertial motion is just (T −∆T ) = ˜T < T :
the instants of time in I
there is a ‘jump’ in the time of (1) as calculated in I
[8, 7]. Let us now
calculate ∆T . From eq.(57) with dt = 0 (simultaneity condition) it can be
obtained

′

By inserting eq.(60) in eq.(58), for dt = 0, it can be obtained

or, in our usual notations

3.2.3 From t = t2 to t = t3

In this stage

• g < 0

• x(t) < 0

• v(t) < 0

• x(t2) = −l2

• x(t3) = −L

• v(t2) = −V

• v(t3) = 0

i.e. at t2 the same force as before is switched again on but in the opposite
direction, so that the clock (1) decelerates and stops at t3 in x(t3) = −L.
Note that, since (1) and (2) are at rest relative to each other at the inversion
point, the maximum distance between the two clocks poses no ambiguity
and is the same when measured in I and A; this is the reason why the same
symbol L as before is used here.

The proper time interval of the clock (2) can be obtained from eq.(42)

for x0 = −l2, v0 = −V, g = −g and dx(t)/dt = 0. It is

It is important to note that neither eq.(69) nor eq.(70) contain l2 but only
the unambiguous length L. Finally, for g → ∞, they tend to zero; instead,
according to Møller, pag. 296 of [3], τ3 − τ2 tends to the ﬁnite value LV /c2.
Eqs.(69)-(70) should be compared with (8.192), pag. 296 of [3] and the
assumptions behind it: Møller assumes x(t2) = −L and t3 − t2 = t1 − t0.
Moreover, some results of the motion of (2) with respect to (1) in I are
used again. Note also that eq.(55) is diﬀerent from eq.(69), contrary to the
assumption of Møller at pag. 295 of [3].

plus twice eq.(78). Instead, the total proper time
interval recorded by the clock (1) from its start to its reunion with the clock
(2) is given by twice eq.(88) plus twice eq.(29) times plus twice eq.(79). In
Fig. 2 the situation is illustrated for a given value of g = 9.8 m/s2 and
diﬀerent durations of the inertial motion. It can be noted that, in general,
the clock (2) does not lag behind the clock (1) when a ﬁnite value of the force
is considered. It turns out that this feature is related to the starting/ending
accelerated steps given by eq.(56) and eq.(88).

4 Concluding remarks

In this paper we have studied the clock paradox in the framework of the
Special and General Theories of Relativity by accounting for the ﬁniteness
of the force which acts on the moving clock denoted as (2). In the case of
a moving body acted upon by an uniform and constant force in the direc-
tion of the motion, such force does aﬀect its proper time; also the relation
between the proper time of the accelerated clock and the proper time of
the non accelerated clock, denoted as (1), does depend on the force (per
unit mass, i.e. the ﬁeld of the force named g) felt by the accelerated one.
While in the rest frame I the proper time intervals are the same for all the
four accelerated steps of the motion of (2), in the accelerated frame A the
situation is diﬀerent. Indeed, according to the General Theory of Relativity,
the proper time intervals of the two accelerated steps related to the inver-
sion of motion of (1), as given by eq.(70) and eq.(79) (Subsections 3.2.3
and 3.2.4), are diﬀerent with respect to those related to the starting/ending
steps, as given by eq.(56) and eq.(88) (Subsections 3.2.1 and 3.2.6). More-
over, for a given accelerated step of the motion of a given clock, it turns
out that ∆τ (1/2)
, i.e. eq.(10)6=eq.(70) and eq.(10)6=eq.(56). As a

The magnitude of the diﬀerential rate of (2) with respect to (1) when they
reunite, as viewed in I and A, does depend on g, as can clearly be noted
by setting the duration of the inertial motion equal to zero. It is important
to note that ∆τ (2)

It is worthwhile noting that, while the clock (2), when it is viewed by
the clock (1) in the inertial frame I, is governed by the equation of motion
of eq.(1), which characterizes the hyperbolic motion, the equation of motion
of the clock (1), when it is considered in the accelerated frame A comoving
with the clock (2), is diﬀerent because it is given by eq.(37).

Another diﬀerence between the descriptions in the two frames is that,
while in I there is no limit on V , provided that it is smaller than c, in A,
instead, the proper time intervals of the starting/ending accelerated steps,
given by eq.(56) and eq.(88), become complex if V > c/2. The author has
to admit that, at present, a deeper reason for that result is not clear to him.
As a conclusion, it can be stated that, when a ﬁnite force F acts upon

(2)

• According to the special relativistic hyperbolic motion (point of view of
(1)), the retardation of (2) with respect to (1) is preserved qualitatively
but not quantitatively with respect to the (unrealistic) case in which
the force applied to (2) tends to inﬁnity or is absent (three inertial
observers case)

• According to the General Theory of Relativity (point of view of (2)),
the force felt by (2) breaks the absoluteness of the retardation of (2)
with respect to (1), both qualitatively and quantitatively.

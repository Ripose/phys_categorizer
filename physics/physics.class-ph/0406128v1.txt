Abstract

A Lagrangean for the dynamics of an electromagnetic ﬁeld in a dis-
persive and dissipative material is constructed (adapting some ideas
by Bekenstein and Hannay) and an expression for the energy density
that is positive is obtained from it. The expression contains extra
(sink) degrees of freedom that represent dissipating modes. In simpli-
ﬁed cases the sink modes can be eliminated to yield an energy density
expression in terms of the electromagnetic ﬁelds, the polarization and
the magnetization only, but which contains parameters associated with
the sink modes. The method of adding extra modes can be used to
set up a Lagrangean formalism for dissipative systems in general, such
that will reinstate time-translation invariance and will yield a unique
energy density.

3 Background

The problematic nature of the electromagnetic ﬁeld energy in a dissipative
material is apparent already at a graduate-teaching level: a frequently used
textbook notes that in a dispersive medium the energy density lacks a ther-
modynamical interpretation [1]. (A dispersive material is necessarily dis-
sipative, since by the Kramers-Kronig relations its constitutive constants,
that are by deﬁnition frequency (ω) dependent, must have an imaginary
part, which represents absorption or energy loss.) The expression for the
energy density that was derived in [1], was valid only for ﬁelds that are
nearly mono-chromatic. For other basic treatments we quote textbooks as
[2]-[4], and note that the last reference labels the expression obtained under
the above conditions as an eﬀective energy density.

We write the relations between the electric ﬁeld and the displacement
using the frequency dependent permittivity ǫ(ω) and between the magnetic
ﬁeld and the induction using the permeability µ(ω), as

~D(~x, ω) = ǫ(ω) ~E(~x, ω),

~B(~x, ω) = µ(ω) ~H(~x, ω).

Then according to [4] we obtain an eﬀective energy density:

Alternative expressions that were subsequently proposed were contro-
versial. One derivation, that required a signiﬁcant departure from standard
electromagnetic theory [5], postulated the independence of the expression of
particular material constants. This was strongly criticized in [6], where the
energy-density formula contained explicitly parameters that were present in
the equation of motion for the ﬁeld. Another derivation, in terms of consti-
tutive constants [7], was found to lead to energy densities that are negative
for a medium with a narrow resonance [8].

The quest for a non-controversial energy density can be regarded from a
more fundamental angle. This quantity is expected to be part of a conserva-
tion equation, which (by a well-known theorem due to Noether) is tied to the
time invariance of the Lagrangean. As soon as the invariance is lost (which

2

is the case for dissipative systems), the quantity to be conserved is unde-
ﬁned. Thus the need to ﬁnd an appropriate energy density is expected to
arise in a wider context, too. (In a dramatic account, in which the proposer
of a time-varying light-velocity describes his Iliad to get his idea published,
one also ﬁnds the problem of the proper Lagrangean formulation to play a
key role [9].)

The issue of the electromagnetic-ﬁeld energy density in a dispersive and
dissipative medium has recently resurfaced in the contexts of the sublu-
minality of light-propagation and of left handed materials ([10],[11]). The
former work utilizes some analytical properties of the constitutive relations,
while the departure point in the latter are the equations of motions for the
macroscopic polarizabilities. As an application, the energy density for a left
handed medium has been calculated in [11]. The expressions in the two
papers diﬀer.

Our approach is based on the recognition that in standard ﬁeld theories
(classical or quantal) the energy momentum tensor satisﬁes a conservation
equation having the form of a ”div”-equation involving all degrees of free-
dom. Thus, it seems, that one should be able to write out an energy-density
in an unambiguous fashion starting with a Lagrangean. (The idea of a La-
grangean formulation was raised earlier [12], but only in a programmatic
manner and by making an assumption that the detailed treatment worked
out in this paper does not justify.)

L

As is well known, the energy density T 0

0 is a component of the energy
momentum tensor T k
j , which is uniquely derivable from the Lagrangean
density
(uk, uk,j), this being a function of the ﬁeld variables uk and of
their derivatives uk,j. (The indexes take the value 0 for the time component
and the numbers (1, 2, 3) for the remaining, space components. Summation
is implied for repeated indexes and a symbol after the comma represents
a derivative. The dot will also be used for a time derivative.) The formal
deﬁnition is given by

Two circumstances appear to prevent one from deriving the energy-
density from the conservation equation in a dissipative material. First, a
Lagrangean has not been formulated for the equations of motion (but this is
done below). Secondly, the energy sinks involved in the dissipative mecha-
nisms have not been given a dynamic representation, but only a phenomeno-
logical one (see equation (1) ), namely, through the appearances of complex

3

permittivity and permeability in the constitutive relations or, equivalently,
through the presence of time-reversal non-invariant terms in the equations
of motion.

The ﬁrst issue was recently resolved in a short note [13], where it was
shown how to formulate the Lagrangean (actually, the Hamiltonian) for a
dissipative case. The second point was (indirectly) addressed in [14], fol-
lowing a previous publication in [15]. These works formulated the dynamics
of a (conjectural) time dependent ﬁne-structure constant by including in
the Universe an additional degree of freedom. We follow up both these
approaches, with changes required by the diﬀerent context.

4 A Lagrangean for static polarization and mag-

netization

Before approaching the general problem we will ﬁrst present a Lagrangean
density for the electromagnetic ﬁeld in a material which has a static polar-
ization and magnetization. The following expression connects the electric
displacement ﬁeld ~D with the electric ﬁeld ~E and polarization ~P :

~D = ǫ ~E + ~P

~H =

~B

−

~M

(ǫ is not necessarily the vacuum permittivity ǫ0). Similarly the magnetic
ﬁeld ~H is connected with the magnetic induction ﬁeld ~B and magnetization
~M by:

(again µ is not necessarily the vacuum inverse permeability µ0). The above
ﬁelds satisfy both the homogeneous Maxwell’s equations:

and the inhomogeneous equations:

curl ~E +

˙~B = 0,

div ~B = 0

curl ~H

˙~D = ~J,

−

div ~D = ρ

In the following we assume that both free charges ρ and currents ~J are
zero. The above equations can not be obtained from a Lagrangean density
expressed in terms of those ﬁelds. However, this situation can be amended

follows:

Using these deﬁnitions we see that the homogenous equations (6) are satis-

The last term µ ~M 2 can be usually discarded for static magnetization since it
represents nothing but a time-independent constant. However, we include it
for future sections in which the polarization and magnetization will become
dynamic degrees of freedom.

5 Equations of motion for polarization and mag-

netization

In cases that the polarization ~P is induced by an electric ﬁeld ~E, and the
magnetization ~M is induced by a magnetic ﬁeld ~H, one needs a set of equa-
tions to describe these processes. The equations are given, e.g., in [11] as:

with all symbols and notation as deﬁned in [11]. In addition, one has the
Maxwell-equations given in the previous sections and derived from the La-
grangean of equation (12) using the contravariant four-vectors Aα = ( ~A, Φ).
Turning now to dissipative cases, following [13] -[15] we introduce a set
of new ﬁelds, here named canonical ﬁelds, which are formally distinguished
from the previous, physical ﬁelds by writing them in lower case symbols.
These ﬁelds (assumed to be real) are made to be part of a Hamiltonian
or Lagrangean formulation, in contrast to the preceding physical quantities
(written in upper case symbols), with which this cannot be done [13]. Ex-
plicitly, we shall work with the scaled polarization pα and magnetization
mα; the electromagnetic ﬁelds eα, hα, the (contravariant) vector-potentials
aα, and (again following [13]) also the ﬁelds rα, nα conjugate to pα and to
mα (as deﬁned below). The choice of the ﬁelds (and of the various constant,
scaling factors) is guided by the requirement that we recapture the form of
the equations of motion and the energy density currently widely employed
in solid state optics in the appropriate limiting case of no dissipation. (This
requirement is at times detrimental to the formal symmetry between the
modes linked with the polarization and the magnetization, respectively.)
The physical meaning of the canonical ﬁelds will be made clear later by
comparing their equations of motion with those of the physical ﬁelds. (For
a similar procedure see [13].) In addition, we shall introduce two new scalar
ﬁelds: ﬁrst Ψ, representing a degree of freedom associated with the dissipa-
tion of the polarization (analogous to the degree of freedom denoted with
the same symbol in [15]) and, secondly, the ”sink-ﬁeld” Φ for the dissipation
in the magnetic mode.

having chosen the polarization and magnetization vectors to be along the
x (or 1) axis. Physically, the new degrees of freedom Ψ and Φ can be
associated with some sort of relaxation mechanism for the polarization and
the magnetization, respectively. In the above, we have chosen for
LΨ and
LΦ what appear to us the simplest type of expressions that can represent
unspeciﬁed (and, so far, arbitrary) degrees of freedom. The symbols κ, ρ, λ, ν
stand for constant, non-negative coeﬃcients, whose values depend on the
nature of the relaxation mechanisms.

The ﬁrst-written form (=sum of squares with non-negative coeﬃcients) of
either quantity guarantees that each part of the energy density is positive
(non-negative). The usual expressions for the energy density, e.g. in [4] or
[11], diﬀer from the above by the presence of the terms in Φ and Ψ and
their time derivatives. In the following section it is our purpose to eliminate
these variables by making use of the equations of motion, equation (31) and
equation (32) .

7 A solvable case

We take a simpliﬁed case when the coeﬃcients ρ and ν are both zero. Then
the equation of motion for the polarization sink-mode equation (31) can be
integrated. (A similar procedure applies to the magnetization sink-variable.)
We assume the following initial conditions for Ψ(t)

Ψ(0) = 0,

˙Ψ(0) = Γe/2

The reason for these choices is that with them for short times, t << 2

The above expressions, equation (47) and equation (48) , are quite similar
to those in equation (11) of Ruppin [11], except that they are written in the
canonical (small letter) variables, rather than in the physical variables (for
relations between these, see immediately below), and that they contain time
dependent denominators.

The main results of this work, equation (46) and its analogue for the
magnetization energy density, are exact and contain nonperturbative cor-
rections to the energy density, due to the presence of the sink degrees of
freedom. While exact, they are model dependent in the sense that sinks
represented by diﬀerent Lagrangeans would lead to diﬀerent energy densi-
ties. This is clear, due to the presence in the energy densities of the param-
eters κ and λ that were introduced in the Lagrangean in equation (23) and
equation (24) . It is of interest to note that the non-dissipative limit is not

8 The physical ﬁelds

To recapture the basic equations of motion equation (15) and equation (16)
for the physical polarization variable, we proceed as follows: We postulate

Then, from equation (40) , for short times 0 < t << 2
Γe

,

This turns (the vector form of) equation (29) into the following:

p(t) = eΨ(t)P (t)
m(t) = eΦ(t)M (t)

and likewise for the magnetization variables. Recalling equation (15) and
equation (16) , we can thus extrapolate to later times so as to identify

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

Thus, all the ”canonical” variables are the ﬁelds in which the decay of the
physical ﬁeld variables has been reinstated. On the other hand, the decay is
itself dependent on the ﬁelds. (Cf. [12].) Furthermore, Maxwell’s equations
for the physical ﬁelds are also modiﬁed, just as in [14] and [15] (eq. (14) and
eq. (12), respectively).

9 Conclusion

Using standard Lagrangean formalism, we have obtained a unique energy
density for a dissipative medium (capable also of sustaining an electric po-
larization and/or a magnetic one). It has been found necessary to introduce
two additional degrees of freedom (”sink-modes”), associated with decay
mechanisms in the electrical and magnetic modes. The derived contribu-
tions to the energy density, shown in equation (46) - equation (48) , are all
positive and are similar in their form to the corresponding results in [11].
They contain particular physical parameters, as anticipated in [6]. The
energy density is part of a conservation equation involving also an energy-
current (momentum) density (the Poynting vector) formally given by the

11

tensor-components T a
0 (a = 1, 2, 3) shown in equation (3) . These properties
appear to be true in general, namely, for a large variety of systems that are
dissipative.

A solvable model has been worked out in this paper. Both in this case and
in a general one, the energy density has corrections not appearing in other
approaches not based on a Lagrangean. On the other hand, in a spatially
homogeneous inﬁnite medium (such as treated in this paper) the momentum
density is still the Poynting vector. This can be seen from equation (3) ,
since the second term in that expression is absent (for α diﬀering from
β) and there are no space derivatives in the Lagrangean, other than in
the electromagnetic part. (As a consequence, the Lagrangean is not fully
Lorentz-invariant.)

For a medium possessing space varying properties (including, under cer-
tain circumstances, a ﬁniteness of size) the procedure outlined in this paper
can be extended to space-coordinates. This means the introduction of new,
space-dependent ”sink” degrees of motion (e.g., at the boundaries). As a
consequence, additional terms would appear also in the momentum density.
Apart from an interesting extension of the Poynting vector concept, the
suggested approach can also have the practical use of solving electromag-
netic problems involving dissipation, such as laser gain and loss calculations,
microwave losses in wave guides and cavities and transformer performance.
The approach can be further extended to other ﬁelds of macroscopic physics
such as viscous ﬂuid dynamics. Work in these directions is under progress.

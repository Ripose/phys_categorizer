We show, by exploring some elementary consequences of the covariance of Maxwell’s equations
under general coordinate transformations, that, despite inertial observers can indeed detect elec-
tromagnetic radiation emitted from a uniformly accelerated charge, comoving observers will see
only a static electric ﬁeld. This simple analysis can help understanding one of the most celebrated
paradoxes of last century.

Paradoxes are very good opportunities to learn and teach Physics. The long-standing paradox about the electro-
magnetic radiation emitted by a uniformly accelerated charge has received considerable attention since the beginning
of the last century. Eminent ﬁgures as Pauli, Born, Sommerfeld, Schott, von Laue, among many others, contributed
to this debate with, curiously, very diﬀerent answers. The relevant questions here are:

1. Does a uniformly accelerated charge actually radiate?

3. Is the equivalence principle valid for such situations?

2. In a constant gravitational ﬁeld, should free-falling observers detect any radiation emitted by free-falling charges?

If the answer to the ﬁrst question is aﬃrmative, a free-falling charge will radiate to an observer at rest since, under a
constant gravitational ﬁeld, any particle should move with uniform acceleration. However, an observer falling freely
with the charge should see it at rest and no radiation at all. How this can be compatible with an aﬃrmative answer
to the ﬁrst question? Moreover, if the equivalence principle is assumed to be valid, one could conclude that a charged
particle at rest on a table should radiate, since for free-falling inertial observers the particle is, indeed, accelerating.
In order to elucidate this puzzle, one needs obligatorily to recognize that the detection of radiation has no absolute
meaning, it depends both on the radiation ﬁeld and the state of motion of the observer[1, 2] (for an elementary
introduction, see [3]). This is the main conclusion of a celebrated and long debate, nicely and exhaustively presented
in the recent series of papers by Eriksen and Grøn[4], where the reader can ﬁnd the relevant references.

Inertial observers have no doubts about the ﬁrst question, they will answer it aﬃrmatively by using special relativity
and Maxwell’s equations, as it is done in any classical electrodynamics text (See, for instance, [5], whose conventions
we adopt here). In spite of this, however, comoving observers (i.e. accelerated observers with respect to whom the
charge is at rest) will not detect any radiation since the radiation ﬁeld is conﬁned to a spacetime region that they
cannot access, beyond a “horizon”[2]. As we will see below, uniformly accelerated observers, on the other hand, are
able, in principle, to detect some electromagnetic radiation from an inertial charge. These observations are enough
to solve the paradoxes posed by the above questions. The last two conclusions are obtained by considering Maxwell’s
equations for non-inertial observers, and this is the point that we address here. We will show that one can easily
conclude that the comoving observer has no access to the radiation ﬁeld of a uniformly accelerated charge; the concept
of a horizon emerges naturally, without the need of any intricate calculation or sophisticated mathematical deﬁnition.
Our approach is inspired by the recent analysis of this problem by Gupta and Padmanabhan[6]. Their result is,
indeed, much stronger. They show how to calculate the radiation ﬁeld for an arbitrarily moving charge by solving
Maxwell’s equation in the (non-inertial) reference frame where the charge is at rest, and then, by exploring the
tensorial character of Maxwell’s equation, transforming the electromagnetic ﬁeld back to the inertial reference frame.
This is a remarkable result since, as stressed by Gupta and Padmanabhan, the spacial and time dependences of the
radiation ﬁeld in the inertial frame have to be translated into geometrical properties of the background metric of the
reference frame where the charge is static, opening the door to further analyses on the Physics of non-inertial frames.

We take the converse way here. We will show below that it is quite simple to conclude that the radiation ﬁeld emitted
by a uniformly accelerated charge is seen from a comoving observer as a purely electrostatic ﬁeld.

Special relativity enforces us to review the Newtonian description of a uniformly accelerated motion by means of a
parabolic trajectory. The speed of light c is the maximum speed that a physical body can attain, thus a true eternal
uniformly accelerated motion should have
. It is quite easy to deduce[5] that a particle moving
with constant proper-acceleration g along the z direction has a hyperbolic worldline given by the curve ra(τ )

where τ is the proper-time as measured by a comoving clock. There is no loss of generality with the hypothesis that
the motion is restricted to the z direction. Such a worldline is displayed in Fig. 1. We assume hereafter in the text

where (7) was explicitly used in the expression for Ez. These are ﬁnally the electromagnetic ﬁelds due to a uniformly
accelerated charge moving according to (1). The radiation content can be extracted by separating the components
dropping oﬀ as 1/R from the usual Coulombian 1/R2 ﬁelds[5]. As shown in Fig. 1, only the regions I and II can
experience the ﬁelds (9). The main conclusion of D.G. Boulware in [2] is that, despite that radiation components
are presented in both regions, only observations performed in region II (and, perhaps, also on the boundary t = z
between the regions I and II) would allow one to detect unambiguously the radiation emitted by the charge, what
would imply, yet according to Boulware, that the comoving observer would not detect any radiation at all, since
region II is inaccessible to uniformly accelerated observers. Although this conclusion is perfectly correct, its logical
derivation is rather involved and not intuitive. First, two regions of spacetime with qualitative distinct behavior of
the radiation ﬁeld, according to inertial observers, are identiﬁed, and, then, its is shown that the comoving observers
have access only to the region where inertial observers are not able to detect any radiation ﬁeld. However, this does
not imply directly that the comoving observers should not detect the radiation since, as we learned in our very ﬁrst
paragraph, the detection of radiation has no absolute meaning, depending both on the radiation ﬁeld and the state
of motion of the observer.

We can, nevertheless, show directly that a comoving observer will see (9) as a static electric ﬁeld. The reference
frame of a uniformly accelerated observer corresponds to the Rindler spacetime[7], which, in our case, is spanned by
the coordinates x′a(x) = (τ (t, z), x, y, ξ(t, z)) deﬁned by

t =

z =

with ξ > 0. The particle under the hyperbolic motion (1) is, in the Rindler reference frame, at rest at ξ = g/2, and
its proper time is measured by τ . In these coordinates, the spacetime interval is given by

Note that the coordinates deﬁned by (10) cover only the region I of the original Minkowski spacetime. Since static
observers (ξ constant) correspond to uniformly accelerating observers in the original Minkowski spacetime, their
, implying that no signal coming from region II will ever
velocity, in the inertial frame, will approach c as τ
reach them (See Fig. 1). The line t = z behaves as an event horizon, no signal emitted in regions II or III can scape
into regions I an IV.

The coordinate transformation (10) can be used to obtain the solution of Maxwell’s equations (3) and (4) for the
Rindler spacetime with a charge e at rest in ξ = g/2. Recall that the electromagnetic ﬁeld F ab is a tensor and, hence,
under a coordinate transformation xa

x′a(x), it transforms as[5, 7]

Since Maxwell’s equations (3) and (4) are covariant under general coordinate transformations, if F ab is a solution of
(3) and (4) in the coordinate system xa, F ′ab will be a solution for the coordinate system x′a(x). As to the magnetic
components of F ′ab, we have

Strictly speaking, one need to be careful about the interpretation of F ′13
as the components of the
magnetic ﬁeld as seen in the Rindler reference frame. A proper deﬁnition of electric and magnetic ﬁeld for non-inertial
reference frames can be obtained from the Lorentz force formula[6]. This issue, however, will not be relevant to our
analysis. By using (9), we have

= 0. The only nonvanishing components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld experienced by
comoving observers are, therefore, F ′01
. Since for a static charge in the Rindler reference frame the
only nonvanishing component of the 4-current J ′a is J ′0
, one concludes from (4) that the remaining nonvanishing
∂0F ′01
components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld are static, i.e.
= 0, leaving no room for any
radiation ﬁeld in region I of Rindler reference frame. This answers deﬁnitively our question. A comoving observer
will never detect any radiation from a uniformly accelerated charge. The comoving observer can receive signals only
from regions I and IV. The ﬁeld emitted by the accelerated charge does not reach region IV, and, in region I, it is
seen by the comoving observer as a static ﬁeld.

The situation is qualitatively diﬀerent beyond the horizon, in region II. Although uniformly accelerated observers
will never receive any information from there, they can indeed aﬀect this region. The coordinate system (10) can be
extended to include region II by considering ξ < 0 and

Incidentally, the same expressions of region I also holds in region II, including the metric (11), but with a deep
diﬀerence due to the change of sign of the metric components: in region II, ξ, instead of τ , plays the role of a time
parameter. The metric (11), hence, is not static in region II. The magnetic components of F ′ab in this region can
be obtained from transformations like (13), but taking into account now that the components 0 (temporal) and 3
(spatial) are, respectively, ξ and τ , leading to

The ﬁelds (17), together with the electric components that can be obtained in an analogous way, are time-depending
solutions of the (vacuum) Maxwell equations in region II, having, indeed, radiating parts[10]. They are, however,
inaccessible for a comoving observer since they are conﬁned beyond his/her horizon.

The Physics of the Rindler space is subtle enough to deserve some extra words. Trajectories with constant ξ (see
Fig. 2) correspond to uniformly accelerated trajectories in the inertial frame, but with distinct accelerations. As

it was already said, the trajectory (1) corresponds to the static worldline ξ = g/2 in the Rindler frame. From the
inertial frame point of view, the true comoving observer should correspond also to ξ = g/2, since any other static
Rindler observer would be in relative motion, according to the inertial frame point of view, with respect to the charge
following (1). However, our results show that the electromagnetic ﬁeld of the uniformly accelerated charge is realized
as a purely electrostatic ﬁeld everywhere in the Rindler frame, implying that even observers with distinct ξ, for which
the charge is not, from the inertial point of view, at rest, would not detect the emitted radiation. This observation,

FIG. 2: The lines of constant ξ and τ , according to (10) and (16), respectively, for the regions I and II. In I, the Rindler
frame, where ξ > 0, the identiﬁed lines corresponds to ξ1 < ξ2 < ξ3 and τ1 < τ2 < τ3. Lines of constant ξ (the hyperbola) are
timelike. On the other hand, for the region II, known as the Milne frame, where ξ < 0, the lines of constant τ are timelike.
The identiﬁed lines in II correspond to the cases τ1 < τ2 < τ3 and ξ1 > ξ2 > ξ3. The horizon, the boundary ct = z between I
and II, corresponds to a half of the degenerated hyperbola corresponding to ξ = 0.

that anticipates a intriguing quantum result[8], reinforces the role played by the unique structure in common to these
distinct observers: their horizon.

We restrict ourselves so far to the classical analysis. The discussion can be considerably enriched with the introduc-
tions of quantum-mechanical concepts. The classical radiation emitted by the accelerated charge in the inertial frame
is constituted by a huge number of real photons, which, due to some subtle quantum eﬀects, cannot be detected by
comoving observers[9]. Quantum mechanics, however, brings also some surprises to this discussion. Let us consider,
in the Minkowski space, the case of a uniformly accelerated observer following a trajectory as (1) and a charge at rest
at the origin. The worldline for this charge is, obviously, the t axis and it is restricted to the regions II and IV. The
solutions of Maxwell equations in the inertial frame are simply the static Coulombian ﬁeld

which spreads over all the four regions of Fig. 1. In the region I, where uniformly accelerated observer can certainly
detect any ﬁeld coming from the charge, the static Coulombian ﬁeld will be realized by such observers as a time-
depending electromagnetic ﬁeld with components

which can be easily calculated with the help of (12) and (15). The ﬁelds (19) are solutions of the (vacuum) Maxwell
equations in region I, as seen from uniformly accelerated observers. They do have radiative components, although
it is not so easy in this case to identify the terms dropping oﬀ as 1/R[10]. Note that the accelerated observers are
completely unaware of the charge fate in region II. As they can detect only the contributions coming from region I
and IV, they will never discover what eventually happen to the charge in region II, if it, for instance, accelerates or
even if it simply vanishes. From the quantum mechanical point of view, this problem is more intricate. A proper
analysis based in quantum ﬁeld theory of this problem demands that the trajectory of the charge be wholly inside

region I. Is it possible to conclude something in this case? Astonishing the answer is yes[8]. In the Rindler reference
frame, static trajectories with ξ
(see Fig. 2) correspond to uniformly accelerated trajectories in the inertial
frame, restricted by construction to the region I, but with proper acceleration ˙V a ˙Va
0. Thus, they correspond, in
fact, to inertial trajectories! One can answer now if uniformly accelerated observers could detect any photon emitted
by these speciﬁc inertial charges, and the answer is no[8]!

We ﬁnish with the remark that the detection of radiation is not the only paradox involving accelerated charges.
Another very interesting one is that related to the radiation reaction force. As it was said above, an inertial observer
does detect the radiation emitted by a uniformly accelerated charge. He/she can even calculate the (non-vanishing)
total radiated power. But we know, also from classical electrodynamics[5], that the radiation reaction force does
vanish for a constant acceleration. Hence, what is acting as the source of the radiated power? How is it possible to
conserve energy in this case? Very interesting questions, but that’s another story[11]...

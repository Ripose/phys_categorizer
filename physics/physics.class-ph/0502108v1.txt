For classical Hamiltonian systems, the adiabatic condition may fail at some critical points. How-
ever, the breakdown of the adiabatic condition does not always make the adiabatic evolution be
destroyed. In this paper, we suggest a supplemental condition of the adiabatic evolution for the
ﬁxed points of classical Hamiltonian systems when the adiabatic condition breaks down at the crit-
ical points. As an example, we investigate the adiabatic evolution of the ﬁxed points of a classical
Hamiltonian system which has a number of applications.

INTRODUCTION

Adiabaticity is an interesting concept in physics both
for theoretical studies and experimental practices [1, 2,
3, 4, 5]. According to the adiabatic theorem [1], if the pa-
rameters of the system vary with time much more slowly
than the intrinsic motion of the system, the system will
undergo the adiabatic evolution. For a classical system,
the adiabatic evolution means that the action of the tra-
jectory keeps invariant. For a quantum system, an ini-
tial nondegenerate eigenstate remains to be an instanta-
neous eigenstate when the Hamiltonian changes slowly
compared to the level spacings [1]. Hence, the adiabatic
evolution has been employed as an important method of
preparation and control of quantum states [6, 7, 8, 9].

However, a problem may arise when the eigenstates
become accident degenerate at a critical point, i.e., when
the level spacing tends to zero at a critical point. For a
classical system it corresponds to that the frequency of
the ﬁxed point is zero at the critical point. The adiabatic
condition is not satisﬁed at the critical point because the
typical time of the intrinsic motion of the system becomes
inﬁnite. Can adiabatic evolution still hold up when the
adiabatic condition breaks down at the critical point?

Our motivation, derives from practical applications in
current pursuits of adiabatic control of Bose Einstein
condensates (BECs) [10], which can often be accurately
described by the nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation. Here
the nonlinearity is from a mean ﬁeld treatment of the
interactions between atoms. Diﬃculties arise not only
from the lack of unitarity in the evolution of the states
but also from the absence of the superposition princi-
ple. This was recently addressed for BECs in some spe-
ciﬁc cases [11, 12]. But then, however, for such systems,
only ﬁnite number of levels are concerned. The nonlinear
Schr¨odinger equation of the system with ﬁnite number of
levels can be translated into a mathematically equivalent
classical Hamiltonian system. The evolution of an eigen-
state just corresponds to the evolution of a ﬁxed point
of the classical Hamiltonian system. Then, the accident
degeneracy of eigenstates is just translated into accident
collision of the ﬁxed points. The latter one is quite well-

known subject and has been studied widely at least as a
purely mathematical problem [13]. Hence, our concern
here is only focused on the adiabatic evolution of the
ﬁxed points of classical Hamiltonian systems.

In this paper, we present a supplemental condition
of the adiabatic evolution for the ﬁxed points of clas-
sical Hamiltonian systems when the adiabatic condition
breaks down at some critical points in the terms of topol-
ogy. As an example, we investigate the adiabatic evolu-
tion of the ﬁxed points of a classical Hamiltonian system
which has a number of practical interests. We show that
the adiabatic condition will break down at bifurcation
points of the ﬁxed points. But the adiabatic evolution is
destroyed only for the limit point. For the branch pro-
cess, the adiabatic evolution will hold, and the correc-
tions to the adiabatic approximation tend to zero with a
power law of the sweeping rate.

II. SUPPLEMENTAL ADIABATIC CONDITION
FOR THE FIXED POINTS OF CLASSICAL
HAMILTONIAN SYSTEMS

For clarity and simplicity, we consider a one-freedom
classical Hamiltonian H(p, q; λ) with canonically conju-
gate coordinates (p, q) where λ is a parameter of this
system. The equations of motion are:

.
q =

We can ﬁnd two kinds of trajectories in the phase space
for the system: ﬁxed points and closed orbits. The ﬁxed
points are the solutions of Eqs. (1) when the right hands
of them are zero. For a Hamiltonian system there are
only two kinds of the ﬁxed points: elliptic points (stable
ﬁxed points), hyperbolic points (unstable ﬁxed points).
The closed orbits are around each of the elliptic points.
We denote the ﬁxed points by z∗

where l is the total number of the ﬁxed points.

where the integral is along the closed orbit. Obviously,
the action of a ﬁxed point is zero. The action is invariant

According to the adiabatic theorem [1], the adiabatic

|z∗ > 0, the ﬁxed point
It is well-known that when det(J)
is a stable ﬁxed point (elliptic point); when det(J)
|z∗ < 0,
the ﬁxed point z∗ is a unstable ﬁxed point (hyperbolic
point). The point with det(J)
|z∗ = 0 is a degenerate point
at which the stability of the system is not determined.
For a stable ﬁxed point z∗, the frequency of this ﬁxed

point is

Obviously, Ω0 depends on the parameter λ.

Supposing at a critical point, namely λ = λc, we have
Ω0(λc) = 0. Therefore, the condition (3) will break down
at the point. We want to know what will happen when
the adiabatic condition fails (will the adiabatic evolution
of the ﬁxed point be destroyed when the adiabatic con-
dition does not hold ?).

In fact, if

det(J)

|z∗ = 0, the point z∗ is a bifurca-

tion point at which the ﬁxed point will collide with the
other ﬁxed points [13, 14]. Hence, the breakdown of
adiabatic condition is equivalent to collision of the ﬁxed
points (equivalent to accident degeneracy of eigenstates

process, ﬁxed points may annihilate or merge into a sta-
ble ﬁxed point. The collision of the ﬁxed points can be
described clearly in the terminology of topology [14].

−
if z∗ is a bifurcation point, the
|z∗ = 0, i.e.
topological index of this point seems to be not deter-
mined. As we have shown before, the point is just the
critical point of adiabatic evolution, corresponding to col-
lision of the ﬁxed points.

However, because the sum of the topological indices
is a topological invariant, the topological index is con-
served in a collision process of the ﬁxed points. There-
fore, the topological index of the bifurcation point can be
determined by the sum of the indices of the ﬁxed points
involved in collision. So, if the topological index of the
bifurcation point is not zero, it is still a ﬁxed point after
collision. But if the topological index of the bifurcation
point is zero, the bifurcation point will not be a ﬁxed
point after collision.

Now, let us imagine what will happen when a ﬁxed
point is destroyed by a collision process. Because there
are only two kinds of trajectories for a classical Hamilto-
nian system: ﬁxed points and closed orbits around each of
the stable ﬁxed point, so when a ﬁxed point is destroyed,
it will form a closed orbit around the nearest stable ﬁxed
point. The action of the new orbit must be proportional
to the distance between the critical point and the nearest
stable ﬁxed point. This sudden change of action (from
zero to ﬁnite) is so-called ”adiabatic tunneling probabil-
ity” which has been studied in Refs.
[16, 17]. On the
other hand, if the topological index of the bifurcation
point is
1, i.e., it is a unstable ﬁxed point after the
collision, we can not expect the adiabatic evolution can
keep on after collision.

−

But if the topological index of the bifurcation point is
+1, i.e., it is still a stable ﬁxed point after the collision,
or in other word, the stable ﬁxed point survive after col-
lision. For such case, the adiabatic evolution will not be
destroyed.

From above discussion, it is clear that when the adi-
abatic condition given by Eq.
(3) does not hold at a
critical point with Ω0 =
|z∗(λc) = 0, the system
will still undergo the adiabatic evolution if the topologi-
cal index of the ﬁxed point z∗(λc) is +1. On the contrary,

if the topological index of the point z∗(λc) is zero or
the adiabatic evolution will be destroyed.

Hence, we get a supplemental condition of the adia-
batic evolution of the ﬁxed points for a classical Hamil-
tonian system when the adiabatic condition breaks down
at a critical point. When the adiabatic condition is not
satisﬁed at a critical point, the topological property of
the bifurcation point plays an important role to judge
whether the system will undergo adiabatic evolution over
this critical point: if the index of the degenerated point
z∗(λc) is +1 the adiabatic evolution will hold. If the index
of the point z∗(λc) is zero or
1, the adiabatic evolution
will not hold.

This classical system can be obtained from a quantum

ple, this model arises in the study of the motion of a small
polaron [18], a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well
potential [19, 20, 21] or in an optical lattice [22, 23], or
for two coupled Bose-Einstein condensates [24, 25], or for
a small capacitance Josephon junction where the charg-
ing energy may be important. This quantum nonlinear
two-level model has also been used to investigate the spin
tunneling phenomena recently [26].

The number of the ﬁxed points depends on the nonlin-

1, there
exist only two ﬁxed points, corresponding to the local
extreme points of the classical Hamiltonian. They are
elliptic points located on lines θ∗ = 0 and π respectively,
each being surrounded by closed orbits. For strong non-
linearity, λ > 1, two more ﬁxed points appear on the
line θ∗ = 0 in the windows

to know what will happen when the adiabatic condition

when the adiabatic condition does not hold ?). There are
two diﬀerent cases for discussing: γ

At the beginning, the system follows the z∗[λ(t)] adia-
batically. But when λ reaches λc = (γ2/3 + 1)3/2, the
adiabatic evolution is destroyed with a jump of action

at the point z∗

Obviously, the breakdown of adiabatical condition leads
to the destroy of the adiabatic evolution.

equations of the Hamiltonian system (6), with the initial
condition λ0 = 2, z0 = z∗

shows the time evolution of this ﬁxed point for a very
small sweeping rate α. The ﬁnal state is a very small
oscillation around the ﬁxed point (z∗ = 0, θ∗ = 0). In
Fig. 2, we plot the dependency of the small oscillation
amplitude δ on the sweeping rate α. From this ﬁgure, it
is clear to see that the amplitude of the small oscillation
will tend to zero with the sweeping rate decreasing as a
α1/2. Therefore, for this case, the
power law: δ = 0.7
system will evolve adiabatically and keep the action not
changing for all the time if the sweeping rate is small
enough, even when λ crosses the critical point λc = 1, at
which Ω0(z∗
c ) = 0, i.e., though the adiabatic condition is
not satisﬁed when λ crosses the point λc = 1, the system
is still undergoing adiabatic evolution.

Then, let µ vary very slowly. At the critical point µ = 0,
the two wells merge into a single well. At this time, the
bifurcation point is (x, p) = (0, 0), which is the bottom of
the single well. So if µ varies very slowly, one can imagine
that the particle will stay at the bottom of the well all
the time, even when the system goes from a double well
to a single one (at this time the adiabatic condition does
not hold but the bifurcation point is still a stable ﬁxed
point, because the bifurcation point still corresponds to
the bottom of the well).

As we have discussed in Sect. II, the breakdown of the
adiabatic condition (Ω0 = 0) corresponds to the trajec-
tory bifurcation, i.e., the points z∗
c is just a bifurcation
point of the ﬁxed points. The properties of the ﬁxed

In fact, if we make the series expansion of the Hamil-
tonian (6) around the critical point, the system can be
approximated to a double well system [20]. Therefore,
the phenomenon of Case 2 can be illustrated by the
standard double well model. Considering a particle in a
double well, the system is described by the Hamiltonian
1/2µx2 + 1/4x4. For µ > 0, it has two stable
H = 1/2p2
ﬁxed points (x, p) = (√µ, 0) and (x, p) = (
√µ, 0), and
an unstable ﬁxed point (x, p) = (0, 0); for µ < 0 it has
a single stable ﬁxed point (x, p) = (0, 0). At the criti-
cal point µ = 0, three ﬁxed points merge into a stable
ﬁxed point. As the parameter µ varies from +1 to
1
−
the system goes from a double well to a single well. The
stable ﬁxed points are just the bottom of the wells, and
the unstable point is just the saddle point of double well.

also been discussed in Ref. [27] in detail.

For the case 2: At the point z∗
z√1

c = 0, the Jacobian de-
terminant D = 0, and D1 =
c ,0) = 0. This
is a branch process of the ﬁxed points. We can prove that
for this case A = C = 0, so the solutions of equations (14)
and (15) give two directions: dz
dz = 0. The
branch process corresponds to merging process. At this
branch point, three ﬁxed points, two elliptic points and
one hyperbolic point, merge together. One can see this
point in Fig. 1(b), in which the dotted line is the trajec-
tory of the hyperbolic point, and the dashed line corre-
sponds to the trajectory of another elliptic point. Since
the total topological index is invariant, the three ﬁxed
points merge to one point with index +1, i.e., merge to
an elliptic point. The elliptic point evolves adiabatically
until it reaches the critical point z∗
c , at which three ﬁxed
points merges to one elliptic point. Therefore, after the
branch process, the elliptic point turns to a new elliptic
point, the action keeps zero and the adiabatic evolution
still holds.

From above discussion, we see that the adiabaticity
breaks down at bifurcation points of the ﬁxed points,
but only for the limit point the adiabatic evolution is
destroyed (case 1), while for this case the two ﬁxed points
annihilate. For case 2, three ﬁxed points merge to one,
because the critical point (z∗
c , 0) is still a stable ﬁxed
point, the adiabatic evolution keeps with action zero.

The phenomena discussed above can occur for the adi-
abatic change of γ with λ ﬁxed. On the other hand, the
Hamiltonian (6) is invariant under the transformations
t. Hence, the phenomena

can also be found under such transformations.

does not hold.
If the topological index of the critical
point is +1 the adiabatic evolution of ﬁxed point will not
be destroyed. On the contrary, if the index of the crit-
ical point is zero or
1, the adiabatic evolution will be
destroyed. As a paradigmatic example, we investigated
the adiabatic evolution of a classical Hamiltonian system
which has a number of practical interests. For this sys-
tem, the adiabaticity breaks down at bifurcation points
of the ﬁxed points. But only for the limit point the adia-
batic evolution is destroyed. For the branch process, the
adiabatic evolution will hold, and the corrections to the
adiabatic approximation tend to zero with a power law
of the sweeping rate.

In general, the corrections to the adiabatic approxi-
mation are exponentially small in the adiabaticity pa-
rameter, both for quantum system and classical system
[1, 2, 3].
It is particularly interesting that the correc-
tions of the adiabatic approximation may be a power law
(e.g., for the case 2). The power law corrections to daid-
abatic approximation have also been found in the non-
linear Landau-Zener tunneling [16]. In Ref. [16], the au-
thors found that when the nonlinear parameter is smaller
than a critical value, the adiabatic corrections are expo-
nentially small in the adiabatic parameter, but when the
nonlinear parameter equals to the critical value, the adia-
batic corrections are a power law of the adiabatic param-
eter. Furthermore, if the nonlinear parameter is larger
than the critical value, the so-called non-zero adiabatic
tunneling will occur [16, 17]. Indeed, the cases, for which
the corrects to the adiabatic approximation are not ex-
ponential law with the adiabatic parameter, correspond
to the collision of ﬁxed points.

IV. CONCLUSION

In summary, at some critical points, the adiabatic con-
dition fails, but the adiabatic evolution may not always
be broken. We ﬁnd that the topological property of the
critical point plays an important role for adiabatic evo-
lution of the ﬁxed points when the adiabatic condition

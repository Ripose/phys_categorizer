Abstract:

It is proved that a source of electromagnetic radiation cannot emit a

diﬀraction-free beam at the wave zone. A Bessel J0 ϕ-invariant beam does

not hold even at the intermediate zone. These results negate claims published

recently in the literature.

An idea of creating a diﬀraction-free beam has been published[1]. The

beam’s amplitude is cylindrically symmetric (ϕ-invariant) where the r-dependence

is proportional to the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind J0(ar) and a is a con-

stant having the dimension of L−1. Reference [1] has arisen a great interest in

utilization of J0 beams and has been cited more than 360 times[2]. An appli-

cation of [1] shows the central peak of the assumed J0 beam[3] and another

one refers to its peculiar z-component wavelength[4]. Another publication

related to [1] claims that a superluminal propagation of light in air has been

detected[5]. Objections to [5] have been published[6]. The purpose of this

work is to show that one cannot construct a diﬀraction-free electromagnetic

beam at the wave zone and that the Bessel function J0(ar) is unsuitable

for describing diﬀraction free ϕ-invariant wave at the intermediate zone too.

This outcome proves that results of papers discussing this topic, in general,

and those ascribing superluminal velocity to beams that take the form of

Bessel function J0, in particular, should be reevaluated. Units where the

speed of light c = 1 are used. The metric gαβ is diagonal and its entries are

(1,-1,-1,-1). ur, uϕ and uz denote unit vectors in cylindrical coordinates and

ux, uy and uz are unit vectors in Cartesian coordinates.

A general analysis of diﬀraction-free solutions of Maxwell equations has

been published[7]. Here the ﬁelds solving the problem are derived from a

vector potential A that satisﬁes the wave equation together with the Lorentz-

gauge requirement[8]. It turns out that this work is relevant to [1] and some

of its results are analyzed here in detail. (Another work[9] is closely related

to [1] and [7].) Let us start with the solution obtained in Example 1 (on

p. 1557 of [7]). Using cylindrical coordinates and removing constant factors,

the time dependent monochromatic electric ﬁeld of this solution is obtained

2

from the vector potential E = −∂A/∂t

E = ωJ1(ar)ei(bz−ωt)uϕ

(1)

where J1 is the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind of order 1. The magnetic

ﬁeld is B = curlA

B = −bJ1(ar)ei(bz−ωt)ur − iaJ0(ar)ei(bz−ωt)uz.

(2)

Ignoring constant factors, one ﬁnds that the magnetic ﬁeld (2) is dual to

the electric ﬁeld of Example 2 of [7]. (The factor 2 in Ur of example 2 is

a misprint.) This outcome indicates that Examples 1 and 2 of [7] represent

dual electromagnetic solutions where E → B, B → −E (see [8], p. 252).

Having the solution, let us examine the problem of a cylindrically shaped

wave guide whose walls are made of a perfect conductor (see [8], p. 335).

The length of the cylinder is much greater than both its diameter 2R and the

wavelength λ = 1/ω (see ﬁg. 1). The boundary conditions along the wave

guide’s walls are (see [8], p. 335)

Thus, the solution (1) and (2) satisﬁes the boundary conditions provided

Ek = 0, B⊥ = 0.

J1(aR) = 0.

(4)

Dynamical properties of the solution (1) and (2) are obtained from the

energy-momentum tensor of the electromagnetic ﬁelds (see [10], p. 81 or [8],

p. 605))

(5)

where F µν denotes the tensor of the electromagnetic ﬁelds. Expression (5)

is quadratic in the ﬁelds. Hence, one should use the real part of (1) and

3

(2) in an evaluation of quantities belonging to it. Let us ﬁrst examine the

momentum density of the ﬁelds. This is the Poynting vector

The z-component of the momentum density and energy ﬂux are obtained

from the substitution of the appropriate real part of (1) and (2)

S =

E × B.

Expression (7) is non-negative at all points, a property which is consistent

with the beam’s expected ﬂux of energy that travels away from a localized

source.

The radial component of the momentum density is obtained analogously

Sr = −

J1(ar)J0(ar)sin[2(kz − ωt)].

(8)

8π

Here one sees that, unlike the case of (7), the sign of (8) alternates periodically

in the time and z-coordinates. Moreover, for any ﬁxed value of t and z, it

changes sign along the r-axis, because zeroes of the Bessel functions J0 and

J1 do not coincide[11]. It follows that although the radial motion does not

vanish locally, its mean value is null. This property indicates that the radial

motion takes the type of a standing wave.

Now let us examine the interaction of the ﬁelds with the walls of the wave

guide. Point P at x = R, y = z = 0 is used as a representation of the general

case and cartesian coordinates are used. The x-component of the momentum

current at P is (see [10], p. 82 or [8], p. 605))

Txx =

(E2

y + E2

z − E2

x + B2

x).

Examining the ﬁelds (1) and (2) and the boundary value (4), one ﬁnds that

only the z-component of the magnetic ﬁeld makes a nonvanishing contribu-

tion. Thus, the momentum current at P is

Txx =

0 (aR)sin2(bz − ωt).
J 2

(10)

8π

This momentum current is absorbed by the walls, because the ﬁelds vanish

in all space outside the inner part of the wave guide.

Another eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld (2) on the wave guide’s walls is the

electric current induced in the ϕ-direction. Indeed, let us evaluate the line

integral along the inﬁnitesimal rectangular closed path of ﬁg. 1. Using vector

analysis, Maxwell equations and the boundary condition (4), one ﬁnds

B·dl =

curlB·ds =

4πj·ds.

Z

Z

(11)

Thus, a nonzero current j is induced on the walls, because only Bz at the

inner part of the wave guide makes a nonvanishing contribution to the line

integral. This outcome proves that a time-dependent (and z-dependent)

electric current ﬂows along the ϕ-direction of the wave guide’s walls and that

ﬁelds of this current are part of the solution (1) and (2). This electric current

sustains the Bz related standing wave in the radial direction. The walls also

counteract against local electromagnetic pressure.

The dual solution of example 2 of [7] behaves analogously. Using the

same global factor of (1) and (2), one ﬁnds for this case

B = ωJ1(ar)ei(bz−ωt)uϕ

E = bJ1(ar)ei(bz−ωt)ur + iaJ0(ar)ei(bz−ωt)uz.

Hence, the boundary conditions (3) yield

(12)

(13)

(14)

Since J0(ar) and J1(ar) have no common root[11], a nonvanishing radial

electric ﬁeld exists at the wave guide’s walls. It follows from Maxwell equation

J0(aR) = 0.

5

divE = 4πρ that a time dependent and z-dependent charge density is built

on the inner part of the wave guide’s walls. Thus, we have also in Example 2

a current that ﬂows on the walls and aﬀects the ﬁelds inside the wave guide.

Let us examine an analogous experimental setup. Here the source of the

radiation at z = −L is the same as that of the ﬁrst experiment but the

wave guide is removed. This situation is diﬀerent from the wave guide case.

Indeed, the ﬁelds of a closed electromagnetic system depend on charges and

currents at the retarded space-time points (see [10], pp. 158-160 or [8], p.

225). Therefore, the wave guide’s solutions clearly do not hold for this case

because here the current along the wave guide walls is missing.

Since in the second experiment the region at z = 0 satisﬁes the wave zone

requirements (see [10] p. 170 or [8], p. 392)

L ≫ λ, L ≫ 2R,

(15)

one can use the wave zone solution. Let A denote the retarded vector po-

tential at the wave zone. Thus, one ﬁnds the ﬁelds (see [10] p. 171)

B = ˙A × n,

E = ( ˙A × n)×n

(16)

(17)

where n is a unit vector in the radial direction.

It turns out that the solution for the free space experiment is inherently

diﬀerent from the one which ﬁts the wave guide’s inner space. In particular,

in the case of free space, ﬁelds at the wave zone are perpendicular to the

radius vector from the source to the ﬁeld point. On the other hand, the wave

guide solution contains a z-component (Bz or Ez) which is an inherent part

of the solution. As shown above, the Bz (or Ez) ﬁeld is associated with the

electric current induced on the wave guide’s walls. This conclusion obviously

6

holds for any pattern of source elements put at the same spatial region as

the one used here, because the analysis does not refer to the source’s details.

Thus, the results disagree with the claim of [9].

One can use general arguments for proving that a diﬀraction-free electro-

magnetic beam that has a nonvanishing z-component for at least one of the

ﬁelds, contains transverse standing wave. Indeed, the beam carries energy

and therefore S of (6) does not vanish. Hence, E is not parallel to B and, due

to the z-component of the ﬁelds, S has a nonvanishing transverse component.

Now, the diﬀraction-free property of the beam prevents energy from ﬂowing

transversally. Hence, the transverse component of S is a standing wave.

It can also be proved that all solutions of [7] have a nonvanishing z-

component of at least one of the ﬁelds. Indeed, the vector potential A takes

the form (see p. 1556 therein)

where αn and βn are numerical coeﬃcients of the expansion. Here

A =

(αnMn + βnNn),

Xn

Mn = curl[Jn(ar)ei(bz+nϕ−ωt)uz]

and

Nn =

curlMn

1
k

where k is the wave number. Now Nn contains a z-component (see p. 1557

therein). Hence, if βn 6= 0 then E = −∂A/∂t = iωA has a z-component

too. In other cases all βn = 0, which mean that for at least one n, αn 6= 0.

Here the magnetic ﬁeld B = curlA = αncurlM = kαnN, which means that

Bz 6= 0 and the proof is completed.

It follows that the family of solutions of [7] involves standing waves as-

sociated with the z-components of the solutions. This diﬀraction-free family

Example 4 of [7] (see p. 1558) is the last one which is analyzed here in

detail. This example contains one component which is proportional to J0(ar)

and is ϕ-invariant. Although it has a ϕ-dependent z-component term which

is associated with a standing wave, it looks simpler to show another problem

of this solution. The vector potential of this example is given in Cartesian

a free space.

A = −iα[aJ0(ar) ux − i

J1(ar)cosϕ uz]ei(bz−ωt).

(21)

Using E = −∂A/∂t, one ﬁnds

E = αω[aJ0(ar) ux − i

J1(ar)cosϕ uz]ei(bz−ωt).

(22)

Let us examine the z-component of the Poynting vector which represents

energy current ﬂowing along the beam’s direction, namely, the quantity which

is analogous to (7) of Example 1. Examining (22), one ﬁnds that only By is

needed for this purpose. Thus, (curl A)y of (21) is

By = α[(ab −

)J0(ar) +

cos2ϕ J2(ar)]ei(bz−ωt).

(23)

Hence, the required z-component of the Poynting vector is obtained as the

Let us examine the z-component of the energy current near a point whose

radial coordinate is ¯R and J0(a ¯R) = 0. In this neighbourhood J2 is domi-

nant[12] and the contribution of the J 2

0 (ar) term of (24) can be ignored. The

rest of (24) is proportional to J0(ar)J2(ar)cos 2ϕ. Now, let us examine the

value of Sz on a circle whose radius is ¯R + ε, where ε is an appropriate small

quantity. Due to the factor cos 2ϕ, one realizes that Sz takes diﬀerent signs

on this circle. Hence, in the solution of Example 4 of [7], energy ﬂows in

opposite z-directions in certain regions of space. This property of Example

4 is inconsistent with the notion of a beam, where electromagnetic energy

ﬂows away from a localized source.

It is clear from the analysis carried out above that, in free space, one

cannot build a diﬀraction free beam from the family of Bessel functions of

[7], because these functions are unsuitable at the wave zone.

Some conclusions can be drawn for the intermediate zone too. The diﬀrac-

tion free ϕ-invariant J0(ar) function proposed in [1] does not belong to the

solutions of [7]. Indeed, in [7], there are only two truly ϕ-invariant solutions.

They are the dual solutions of Examples 1 and 2 which are discussed above.

As proved in this work, the z-component of the energy current is propor-

tional to J 2

1 (ar). Hence, the ﬂow of energy vanishes along the z-axis. It is

also proved above that Example 4 of [7], where there is one J0 term which

is ϕ-invariant, does not describe a beam of electromagnetic radiation and

its z-component is not ϕ-invariant. It follows that experiments using a ϕ-

invariant setup and showing a strong peak at the center (like [1,3,4]) should

not be interpreted by means of diﬀraction free solutions.

We numerically study single-defect photonic crystal waveguides obtained from a triangular lattice
of air holes in a dielectric background.
It is found that, for medium-high air ﬁlling ratios, the
transmission has very small values in narrow frequency regions lying inside the photonic band gap
- the so-called mini-stop bands. Two types of mini-stop bands are shown to exist; one of which is
due to the multimode nature of the waveguide. Their dependence on the length of the waveguide
and on the air ﬁlling ratio is presented.

Photonic band gap (PBG) materials, also known as
photonic crystals (PCs), have been extensively studied
recently because of their ability to control the propa-
gation of light [1,2,3]. A very promising application of
PBGs is for improving the performance of waveguides
[4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]. A photonic crystal waveguide is basi-
cally a PC with a linear defect, which allows the prop-
agation of light in a speciﬁc direction. PC waveguides
provide a superior guiding mechanism with respect to
dielectric or metallic waveguides since they are ideally
loss-less, because of the PBG properties. Guiding the
light without losses, and even through sharp corners us-
ing two-dimensional (2D) PCs was studied theoretically
[4] and experimentally, both in microwaves [5] and in op-
tical [6,7,8,9] regimes. To eliminate out-of-plane losses in
2D PC structures, one has to use a index-guiding mech-
anism in the vertical direction [10,11,12,13].

Detailed numerical studies of straight PC waveguides
of diﬀerent widths, in a high dielectric background [14,15]
and in air [16], have revealed that a complete frequency
gap, called mini-stop band (MSB) or mode-gap, exists
for the guided modes of the waveguide. The term MSB
[15] refers to an anti-crossing mechanism between guided
modes of diﬀerent order; whereas the term mode-gap [16]
is used for the band splitting of the folded guided mode at
the edge of the one-dimensional (1D) Brillouin zone. In-
deed, a straight PC waveguide is actually a system with a
discrete periodicity along the waveguide’s axis, in which
the 1D periodic potential given by the PC may produce
mode couplings whenever the Bragg condition is fulﬁlled.
Existence of MSBs has also been experimentally demon-
strated by Olvier et al. [15] for waveguides in GaAs based
PC heterostructures.
In all of the previous studies no
MSBs were observed for the 2D PC waveguide, which has
one row of cylinders missing (single-defect waveguide).
We adopt the term MSB to refer both the anti-crossing
and the band splitting of a folded mode.

The purpose of this work is to investigate the single-
defect PC waveguide for a triangular lattice of air holes in
a dielectric background, showing the occurrence of MSBs.
Their dependence on the length of the waveguide and on

the air ﬁlling ratio will be presented and connections with
the Fabry-Perot modes of the 1D cavity made of the lin-
ear defect will be discussed. The dielectric constant ǫ of
the background is chosen to be 11.56, which corresponds
to GaAs at the wavelength λ of 1.55µm. The 2D PC has
a gap for the TE mode, whose width depends [1] on the
air ﬁlling ratio f . TE is the mode which has the mag-
netic ﬁeld parallel to the axes of the air cylinders. One
can easily create a waveguide by removing a row of air
holes. This structure is shown in Fig. 1, where a is the
lattice constant and w is the width of the waveguide. The
waveguide has variable length in the dense Γ−K direction
(ˆx direction). The ﬁeld conﬁnement in the perpendicular
ˆy direction (Γ − M ) is provided by 5 PC rows arranged
at both sides of the waveguide. Numerical results have
been obtained with a 2D ﬁnite-diﬀerence time-domain
(FDTD) method [17], implemented with Liao absorbing
boundary conditions [18]. The numbers 1 and 2 in Fig.
1 represent the positions of the FDTD source: position
1(2) means transmission along the ˆx(ˆy) direction.

The missing holes yield a waveguide of width w along the
Γ − K direction; a is the lattice constant; 1 and 2 mark the
positions of the source.

In Fig.

2, we present the results for the case of
f = 60% for both the perfect periodic case, as well as
the waveguide case (source in position 1). Inside the gap

of the periodic photonic crystal, the transmission coef-
ﬁcient of the waveguide is above 80% [19], for almost
all frequencies. Notice that there are two frequencies
ν1 = 0.321, ν2 = 0.377 (units of c/a), where the trans-
mission is low. We attribute these gaps in the transmis-
sion to MSBs, i.e. gaps in the dispersion relation. Notice
also, that, as we increase the length of the waveguide,
both the drops of the MSBs get larger, as expected. On
the other hand, for frequencies corresponding to a guided
mode, the transmission is independent of the length of
the waveguide [19]. Since the size of the PBG and the
width w are related to f , we have addressed the spectral
behaviour of the transmission for diﬀerent values of f .

FIG. 2. Transmission spectra for various lengths of the
waveguide, with f = 60%. The bold solid (dotted) line de-
limits the Γ − K (Γ − M ) PBG of the bulk PC. The solid,
dotted and dashed lines correspond to the transmission along
the waveguide (source in position 1) with length 10a, 30a and
60a respectively.

In Fig. 3, we plot the width of the gap for the periodic
PC, as well as the frequencies ν1 and ν2 of the two MSBs
versus f . From Fig. 3, one sees that for small f , there
is no MSB inside the gap of the periodic system. This is
the reason that no MSBs were seen in previous studies
[14,15,16] of single-defect PC waveguides. Notice that for
large f , more than two MSBs are seen. These additional
MSBs present a dispersion with f similar to the MSBs
found for f = 60%.

To understand the character of the MSBs, we plot in
Fig. 4 the intensity of the electric ﬁeld |E2| at the mid-
gap frequency for the low- and high-frequency MSB for
the case f = 60%. In Fig. 4(a), the proﬁle extends all
over the waveguide and it is a “Bloch-like” wave, similar
to the pattern of the fundamental guided mode. How-
ever, it slowly decays as the ﬁeld propagates through the
waveguide. Notice that the PC waveguide is a 1D peri-
odic system with a unit cell of length a, whose reduced
Brillouin zone is (0, π/a). The modulated dielectric con-

Returning to Fig. 4(a), if one counts the nodes in the
ﬁeld pattern along ˆx, it is found that the wavelength is
the unfolded wave-vector k is
roughly equal to a; i.e.
2π/a, corresponding to k = 0 in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone.
At k = 0, the periodic potential couples the two coun-
terpropagating fundamental modes (k = ±2π/a), which

would be otherwise degenerate. Therefore, with Fig. 2
and Fig. 4(a) in mind, we recognize this MSB as the gap

higher mode with a cut-oﬀ frequency given by the corre-
sponding cavity mode. The low-frequency cavity mode
is odd with respect to the ˆx axis; for the PC waveguide
of Fig. 1 the odd modes cannot couple to even modes
[14,15]. This is the reason for the absence of a MSB close
to the “odd” resonant frequency.

FIG. 5. Transmission spectra for the 1D cavity (solid line)
and the waveguide (dotted line), with f = 60% and length
10a. For the 1D cavity is intended that the transmission is
calculated along the ˆy direction, with the source in position
2, see Fig. 1.

The proﬁle shown in Fig. 4(b) is completely diﬀerent
than that shown in Fig. 4(a). The electric ﬁeld is now
strongly localized and has nodes along ˆy. Above the
frequency of the MSB, the ﬁeld pattern returns to be
that of the fundamental guided mode. This suggests the
existence of another gap in the dispersion relation of the
fundamental mode. According to Fig. 4, the origin of
the high-frequency MSB cannot have the same nature
of the low-frequency MSB, otherwise the ﬁeld patterns
would be similar. We suspect that this MSB is due to a
coupling (anti-crossing) between the fundamental mode
and a higher mode. To check this idea, we have to ﬁnd
evidence of at least one higher guided mode at frequencies
inside the PBG. Since there is a correspondence between
the cut-oﬀ frequency of a guided mode and the resonant
frequency of a Fabry-Perot mode [15,20], the search for
cavity modes indirectly proves the existence of guided
modes.

The PC waveguide of Fig. 1 can be seen as a 1D cav-
ity when the source is in position 2, see Fig. 1, and the
progagation is along the ˆy direction. We have calculated
the transmission coeﬃcient for such 1D cavity and show
the results in Fig. 5. As one can clearly see, there are
two peaks in the transmission, which correspond to two
cavity modes. The high frequency peak is very close to
the MSB; the low-frequency peak does not align with any
MSB. Looking at the ﬁeld patterns of the cavity modes,
we indeed ﬁnd that the high-frequency peak has the same
symmetry and the same number of nodes as the ﬁeld
for the MSB at ν2. We infer that the MSB stems from
the anti-crossing between the fundamental mode and the

FIG. 6. Dispersion relation for the PC waveguide, with
f = 60%. The gray area is the projected band structure
of the perfect 2D crystal. The bold solid lines correspond to
TE guided modes, even with respect to the waveguide’s axis.

To give more insight of the MSBs, we have also calcu-
lated the band structure for the even TE modes of the
waveguide shown in Fig. 1, with f = 60%. The results
are plotted in Fig. 6. The horizontal axis is the wavec-
tor in the direction of the guide, and the band structure
is presented in the reduced Brillouin zone scheme. The
gray areas are the projections of every mode in the band
structure of the perfect crystal. We focus only on the
guided modes ranging in the PBG frequencies. The low-
frequency MSB is coming from the folding of the fun-
damental mode at k=0, as deducted from the previous
ﬁeld analysis. The high frequency MSB is coming from
the anti-crossing between the fundamental and the higher
order mode. This guided mode has a cut-oﬀ frequency
νc = 0.378 and a small negative dispersion.
The weak depedence of the low-frequency MSB on f,
shown in Fig. 3, relies on the fact that the fundamental
mode is almost concentrated in the dielectric channel.
Therefore, its dispersion relation feels the ﬁlling factor
only through the width w; likewise is for the position of
the low-frequency MSB. On the other hand, the higher
modes are more extended in the PC region and their dis-
persion relation will be more sensitive to the ﬁlling ratio.
The high-frequency MSB, which is an anti-crossing be-
tween two dispersion relations (fundamental mode-higher
mode) will change its position according to the higher
mode, which encounters the fundamental mode at higher
frequencies as the ﬁlling ratio is increased.
In other
words, the fundamental mode is guided by the high in-

[19] Because of the coupling eﬃciency of the incident and out-
going waves with the guided mode, the peak transmission
could result less than one. To improve the coupling, we use
a source with a spatial proﬁle close to that of the funda-
mental guided mode of the PC waveguide. The fact that
the transmission is independent of the length of the waveg-
uide conﬁrms that “losses” are not intrinsic and have to be
referred to the non-optimal coupling eﬃciency.

dex path, as for a dielectric waveguide, and the PBG is
not important. On the contrary, the higher guided mode
does exist because the ﬁeld conﬁnement is provided by
the PBG.
We have undertaken dispersion relation calculations for
values of f where more than two MSBs exist. The higher-
is a band splitting of
frequency MSB-1, see Fig.
the fundamental mode at k = π/a, whereas the higher-
frequency MSB-2 is not a neat MSB, but a more compli-
cated coupling among the guided modes and the photonic
bands at the bulk gap’s edge. Moreover, from transmis-
sion studies, we have noticed a similar behaviour for the
ﬁrst and third MSBs, and for the second and fourth MSBs
respectively.

We have observed that the transmission through
single-defect PC waveguides has very small values in nar-
row frequency regions, the so-called MSBs. There are two
types of MSBs and they are due to the 1D periodic po-
tential of the PC along the waveguide. One MSB comes
from the splitting of the folded fundamental guided mode
at the zone edge of the reduced Brillouin zone; the other
one comes from the anti-crossing between the fundamen-
tal mode and the higher order mode. The fundamental
mode is sustained by a index guiding mechanism, whereas
the higher modes are distinctive of PC waveguides and
they are conﬁned by the PBG. This diﬀerence is found in
the dependence of the MSBs’ position on the ﬁlling ratio
as well as in the dispersion relation.

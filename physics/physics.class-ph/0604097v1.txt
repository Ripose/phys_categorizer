Delayed Choice Between Purely Classical States

(Dated: July 25, 2013)

It is argued that Wheeler’s insightful idea of delayed choice experiments may be explored at a
classical level, arising naturally from number-theoretical conjugacies always necessarily present in the
equations of motion. For simple and representative systems, we illustrate how to cast the equations
of motion in a form encoding all classical states simultaneously through a “state parameter”. By
suitably selecting the parameter one may project the system into any desired classical state.

PACS numbers: 03.65.Ta, 03.65.Fd, 03.65.Wj, 42.50.-p

The investigation of the relationship between quantum
and classical states is experiencing nowadays a renewed
upsurge of interest driven by new pressing challenges re-
lated to technological needs arising from quantum engi-
neering [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and from quantum information
processors which promise eﬃcient solution to problems
that seem intractable using classical devices [8, 9]. A re-
cent issue of Nature is dedicated to these novelties where
it is explained why, “despite some remaining hurdles, the
mind-bending and frankly weird world of quantum com-
puters is surprisingly close” [10].

A particularly fruitful bridge facilitating the under-
standing of correlations between quantum and classical
phenomena has been Bohr’s principle of complementarity
[11] stating that quantum systems, or “quantons” [12, 13]
posses properties that are equally real but mutually ex-
clusive. With this concept, the familiar wave-particle
duality may be phrased more objectively as follows: De-
pending on the experimental circumstance a quanton be-
haves approximately either as a classical particle or as
a classical wave. The standard way of exploiting quan-
tons is by using interferometers such as the traditional
double-slit experiment of Young [14], specially as mani-
fest in the novel and very ingenious recent implementa-
tions [15, 16, 17], or the Mach-Zehnder setup. In these
frameworks, the signature of wavelike behavior is the fa-
miliar interference pattern, whereas the signature of par-
ticlelike behavior emerges whenever one can discriminate
along which way the interferometer has been traversed.
Many interesting “classical eﬀects” of interference have
been discussed in the literature [18, 19, 20]. Inspired by
a series of experiments proposed by Wheeler some years
ago, we wish to consider here another type of classical
analogon of notions familiar from investigations of quan-
tons.

In an insightful contribution Wheeler named, spelled
out and elucidated by seven examples the so-called “de-
layed choice experiments”, instigated by the following
question concerning the screen with two slits [21, 22]:
Can one choose whether the photon (or electron) shall
have come through both of the slits, or only one of them,
after it has already transversed this screen? His moti-
vation to ask this question was what he refers to as a

pregnant sentence of Bohr: “...it... can make no diﬀer-
ence, as regards observable eﬀects obtainable by a def-
inite experimental arrangement, whether our plans for
constructing or handling the instruments are ﬁxed before-
hand or whether we prefer to postpone the completion of
our planning until a later moment when the particle is
already on its way from one instrument to another” [23].
Experimental conﬁrmation followed soon [24, 25].

Here we argue that the fruitful concept of delayed
choice is no alien to classical physics and may be di-
rectly recognized and retrieved from the multivalued
nature of the equations of motion of all discrete-time
dynamical systems of algebraic origin [26].
In classi-
cal dynamical systems, delayed choice is tantamount to
orbital parameterization and arises thanks to number-
theoretical properties shared by the equations deﬁning
the inﬁnite set of periodic orbits building the scaﬀolding
of orbits known to underly both classical and quantum
dynamics[27, 28, 29, 30].

f (x) = a

To illustrate how delayed choice works in classical sys-
tems we ﬁrst consider the paradigmatic logistic map [31]
x2. For a = 4 this system serves ad-
x
equately for dynamics based computation, in particular
to emulate logic gates, to encode numbers, and to per-
form speciﬁc arithmetic operations such as addition and
multiplication on these numbers [32]. We consider a fully
general situation however, letting a to be a free param-
eter. In discrete-time dynamics, the period is the fore-
most discrete (“quantized”) quantity [33]. To illustrate
concepts and methodology, we ﬁrst derive a pair of poly-
nomials, P3(x) and S3(σ), encoding simultaneously all
possible orbits of period-3. Period 3 is the quintessence
period in dynamical systems. For, existence of period
3 implies existence of all other periods because of the
powerful theorem “period three implies chaos” [34].

Period-3 orbits are obtained by composing the equa-

tion of motion f (x) three times consecutively, f (3)(x)
≡
f (f (f (x))), and isolating lower-lying periods by division
as usual [33]. This yields the basic polynomial H3(x)
with roots xi ruling all possible period-3 motions

The degree of H3(x) reveals that we have to deal with
two period-3 orbits, which for arbitrary a are distinct.
So, generically we deal with two independent triplets of
numbers which are entangled among the roots of H3(x).
Although the coeﬃcients of the sextic are relatively tame
functions of a, its roots are not. From the inﬁnity of
possible relative-sextic quantities, phase-space dynam-
ics knows precisely which adequate combination of alge-
braically conjugate numbers to select in order to produce
tame H3(x) polynomials. The task now is to to ﬁnd a
means of eﬃciently disentangling the pair of triples com-
posing individual period-3 orbits, i.e. of decomposing the
sextic into a pair of cubics. This will be done now in two
diﬀerent ways. The ﬁrst is a procedure that is sometimes
practical. The other one works systematically.
Symmetric representation: The standard mathematical
way of ﬁnding roots of polynomials relies on comput-
ing discriminants [35], generalizing the well-known pro-
cedure to solve quadratic equations. So, the discriminant
. It contains
of H3(x) is ∆3 ≡
a factor which is not a perfect-square, thus a natural
candidate for an extension ﬁeld over which to attempt
to factor the equation of motion.
Indeed, introducing
7)1/2, over the relative-quadratic
the radical r
(4a
extension Q(r) of the rationals one ﬁnds a symmetric
decomposition H3(x) = ψ1(x)ψ2(x), valid for arbitrary
values of a, where

and where u

≡
pair of cubics expresses the orbits as conjugate factors of
the radical r. Interchanging the branches of r simply con-
verts one orbit into the other. These cubics already show
the interesting property that we wish to explore: the in-
dividual formal representation of either ψ1(x) or ψ2(x) al-
ready contains in its structure information concerning all
possible physical solutions. Particular solutions emerge
only when we ﬁx the branches of the radical r. The above
derivation is not helpful in general because the presence
of non-quadratic factors in the discriminant does not au-
tomatically imply factorizability. A method that works
in general, for arbitrary periods, is the following.
Asymmetric representation: Independently of discrimi-
nants, the individual orbits entangled in H3(x) may be
sorted out systematically as follows. Denote by ξ any ar-
bitrary root of H3(x). To form a period-3 orbit, such root
must be obviously connected to two companion roots: ξ,
f (ξ), f (2)(ξ) = f (f (ξ)). These orbital points split H3(x)
into cubics. They may be used to construct the familiar
trio of elementary symmetric functions

θ1(ξ) = ξ + f (ξ) + f (2)(ξ)
θ2(ξ) = ξf (ξ) + ξf (2)(ξ) + f (ξ)f (2)(ξ)
θ3(ξ) = ξf (ξ)f (2)(ξ),

which remain invariant under permutations of the orbital
ξ2)2
points. The fact that f (ξ) = a
and that ξ is a root of H3(x) allows us to express any
pair θm(ξ), θn(ξ) in terms of the remaining member of
the trio. A fruitful choice is to express θ3(ξ) and θ2(ξ) in
terms of the sum θ1(ξ) of orbital points:

the equation of motion for the disentangled orbit.

Similarly, calling η, f (η) and f (2)(η) = f (f (η)) the
remaining triplet of roots of H3(x), one sees that they
obey the same functional relations above, namely θ1(η),
θ2(η) and θ3(η). As already mentioned, this triplet is in
general distinct from θ1(ξ), θ2(ξ) and θ3(ξ), since they
deﬁne diﬀerent orbits.

Denoting indistinctly by x1, x2, . . . , x6 the roots of
H3(x), the sum and product of θ1(ξ) and θ1(η) are then

θ1(ξ) + θ1(η) = X xj = 1,

or θ1(ξ) = 1
sees that, for each periodic orbit, the convenient param-
eter σ is simply the sum of its orbital points. Using the
constraint S3(σ) = 0 we may eliminate a from Eq. (3)
and obtain an equation whose unknown coeﬃcient is ei-
ther θ1(ξ) or θ1(η), depending which orbit we want to
consider. For the choice in Eq. (5) we get

The cubics ϕ1(x), ϕ2(x) look very diﬀerent from ψ1(x),
ψ2(x) although both pairs represent the same physics,
i.e. the same set of orbits. By eliminating σ between
S3(σ) and either ϕ1(x) or ϕ2(x) we get back the original
polynomial H3(x) of Eq. (1). Identical result is obtained
eliminating r between r2 = 4a
7 and either ψ1(x) or
ψ2(x). Comparing coeﬃcients of equal powers in the sex-
tics H3(x) and Q3(x) one recognizes that all coeﬃcients
are interconnected by the constraint S3(σ).

The discriminants of the ϕ1(x) and ϕ2(x) are

∆ϕ1 = (4σ2

∆ϕ2 = (4σ2

Now, recall that “any third-degree polynomial p(t)
∈
Q(t) which is irreducible over the rationals Q will have a
cyclic Galois group if and only if the discriminant of p(t)
is a square over Q” [36]. Thus, ∆ϕ1 and ∆ϕ2 manifest
clearly the advantage of σ-parameterization: It produces
at once orbital equations with cyclic Galois group in a
number-ﬁeld of degree coinciding with the period of the
orbits, i.e. the smallest number-ﬁeld possible, yielding
separated rather than entangled factors. This is not the
case if we compute discriminants for ψ1(x) and ψ2(x).
Although ϕ1(x) and ϕ2(x) are distinct functions, their
discriminants with respect to σ are identical.

After this excursus emphasizing strength and general-
ity of the method, let us consider what is encoded into
ϕ1(x) and ϕ2(x). As the constraint S3(σ) = 0 shows,
two diﬀerent values of σ lead to the same value of a.
For instance, by taking either σ = 0 or σ = 1 we reach
a = 2, the “partition generating limit” with many valu-
able properties [27], the limit where one may emulate
logic gates, encode numbers, perform speciﬁc arithmetic
operations on these numbers [32], and more [33]. For
σ = 0, 1 we dispose of two independent microscopic σ-
representations for each macroscopic state, namely

Φ(x) = ϕ1(x; 0) = ϕ2(x; 1) = x3
Φ(x) = ϕ1(x; 1) = ϕ2(x; 0) = x3

3x

2x + 1,

where the overline is used to indicate that, in spite of
their rather diﬀerent functional forms, both functions are
dynamically conjugated. These four expressions show
that by permuting the values of σ we eﬀectively inter-
change orbits,
independently of the choice for ϕℓ(x).
Macroscopically in phase-space we deal with Φ(x) and
Φ(x). But microscopically the description may be done

3

equally well using either ϕ1(x, σ) or ϕ2(x, σ). This de-
generacy is not normally seen in phase-space [37].

Note that knowledge of just a single state, here ϕ1(x, σ)
or ϕ2(x, σ), is enough to grant access to all physical states
because the results obtained for one of them follow au-
tomatically for all conjugate family when we change the
value of σ. For higher periods, conjugate families nor-
maly contain hundreds of states. This is quite a lot be-
cause period-three implies chaos [34]. Thus, σ-the encod-
ing stores conveniently all information concerning period-
k dynamics for arbitrary k. It is a generic property of
algebraic equations, not a peculiarity of the illustrative
example considered. By suitably selecting σ one may
switch from one orbit to another, performing a “delayed
choice” of the ordering (labeling). By iterating polyno-
mial automorphisms rather than orbital points one my
even bypass the need for ﬁnding orbits in phase-space. In
other words, orbits are automorphically correlated [37].
It is as if we were dealing with a multilevel “atom” in
which the states could be deﬁned and redeﬁned by se-
lecting the appropriate σ.

Do such parametric encodings exist also in more com-
plicated multidimensional dynamical systems? Yes: the
algebraic properties explored here are generic for dynam-
Incidentally, one-
ical systems of algebraic origin [26].
dimensional systems do not represent any restriction be-
cause multidimensional systems may be always reduced
to one-dimensional equivalents [38]. For example, for the
x2 + by, x), the prototypical
H´enon map (x, y)
multidimensional system which among other things de-
scribes very well the parameter space of class B lasers,
CO2 lasers in particular [39, 40], the generic cubic orbit
encoding all period-3 solutions and valid for arbitrary
values of the parameters a and b is

In the fully dissipative b = 0 limit these equations cor-
rectly reproduce all results above. Parameterized equa-
tions covering the Hamiltonian limit (b =
1) and valid
for all periods up to 22 are studied elsewhere [41]. Thus,
one clearly sees that adding more parameters and/or ex-
tra dimensions only alter coeﬃcients, not substance.

−

By adapting a concept developed for understanding
quantum measurements we obtained a uniﬁed picture
of what happens at the micro and macroscopic level
of discrete-time classical dynamical systems. This new
perspective is of course expected to apply equally well
to more general situations, not only to algebraic sys-
tems. Although mathematical diﬃculties in deriving
closed-form results for more intricate equations of mo-
tion greatly increase in this very general setup, no essen-
tial hindrances are anticipated to exist.

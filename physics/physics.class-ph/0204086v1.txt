ABSTRACT: The Bragg regime shifts when conventional materials in a multilayer

distributed Bragg reﬂector (DBR) are replaced by artiﬁcial materials with the so–

called negative index of refraction. This provides an avenue for characterizing the

latter class of materials.

1 INTRODUCTION

Artiﬁcial materials with the so–called negative index of refraction at ∼ 10 GHz fre-

quency have garnered much recent interest [1]–[6]. These isotropic materials, with

supposedly negative real permittivity and negative real permeability, were the subject

of a mid–1960s paper of Veselago [7], who predicted certain unusual electromagnetic

properties and coined the unclear term left–handed materials for them. Handed these

materials are not [8], issue can be taken on the isotropy of their ﬁrst samples [3], and

strictly non–dissipative no materials can be [9]. Yet the only available experimental

result [3] conclusively shows that these materials are diﬀerent from their conventional

counterparts (i.e., those with positive real permittivity and positive real permeabil-

ity). As better realizations are probably in the wings, in colloquial terms, the business

of macroscopic electromagnetics can no longer be as usual.

The manufacturing process of the subject artiﬁcial materials delivers samples in the

form of slabs. Even a cursory perusal of key papers [1]–[3] reveals that characteristic

observable properties of these materials supposedly are manifested most clearly when

plane waves are obliquely incident on planar interfaces with their conventional coun-

terparts. Indeed, the only experimental conﬁrmation of their unusual characteristics

exploited oblique incidence on a planar interface with air [3]. In contrast, we present

here a conﬁguration wherein the incidence is normal and yet the subject artiﬁcial

materials can be easily distinguished from their conventional counterparts as follows.

2 ANALYSIS

Distributed Bragg reﬂectors (DBRs) are commonly used planar devices in optics [10]–

[14]. A multilayer DBR is a stack of layers of two alternating materials with diﬀerent

indexes of refraction as well as low absorption, exhibiting very high reﬂectance in

the so–called Bragg regime. If P denotes the thickness of a unit cell comprising two

adjacent layers, and ¯n is some eﬀective index of refraction, then the Bragg regime is

located about the (free–space) wavelength [11]–[13]

λBr
0 = 2P ¯n .

(1)

(Bragg regimes are also possible around integer submultiples of this λBr

0

, but it must

be borne in mind that indexes of refraction are wavelength–dependent, in general.)

The parameter ¯n depends on the indexes of refraction and the volumetric proportion

of the two constituent materials.

Suppose the region 0 ≤ z ≤ L is occupied by a multilayer DBR, as shown in Figure

1. The multilayer DBR comprises N unit cells, each made of two layers labeled a and

b, with relative permittivities ǫa,b and relative permeabilities µa,b. With P = L/N

as the thickness of the unit cell, the thickness of layer a is equal to qP , 0 ≤ q ≤ 1.

A plane wave is normally incident on the DBR from the vacuous half–space z ≤ 0,

with λ0 denoting its wavelength. Therefore, a reﬂected plane wave also exists in the

half–space z ≤ 0, and a transmitted plane wave in the vacuous half–space z ≥ L.

The corresponding electric ﬁeld phasors are given by

E(z, λ0) = ux

a exp(ik0z) + r exp(−ik0z) ,

t exp [ik0(z − L)] ,

z ≤ 0

z ≥ L

where k0 = 2π/λ0 is the free–space wavenumber; a, r and t are the amplitudes of

the incident, reﬂected and transmitted plane waves, respectively; while (ux, uy, uz) is

the triad of cartesian unit vectors. An exp(−iωt) time–dependence is implicit, where

ω = k0/(ǫ0µ0)1/2 is the angular frequency, while ǫ0 and µ0 are the permittivity and

the permeability of free space, respectively.

The amplitudes r and t must be determined in terms of a. This is best done by

setting up the 2×2 matrix equation [15]

where η0 = (µ0/ǫ0)1/2 is the intrinsic impedance of free space. This equation has to

be numerically solved, which we did. The principle of conservation of energy requires

that |r|2 +|t|2 ≤ |a|2, with the equality holding only if the both constitutent materials

in the DBR are non–dissipative at the particular value of λ0. Our algorithm satisﬁed

the conservation principle.

3 NUMERICAL RESULTS

Figure 2 shows the computed reﬂectance |r/a|2 as a function of λ0/P for three values

of q when ǫa = 4(1 + i0.001), µa = 1.02(1 + i0.001), ǫb = 1, µb = 1 and N = 20.

The Bragg regime is clearly observable via the rectangular feature with an almost

ﬂat top and two vertical sides in all three plots. The full–width–at–half–maximum

bandwidth ∆λ0 of the Bragg regime is typically < 1.25 P for all q. Predictably, the

Bragg feature vanishes for q = 0 and q = 1. As q increases, so does λBr

0 /P (at the

center of the Bragg feature in each plot); which amounts to an increase in ¯n, as shown

Gerardin and Lakhtakia: Negative index of refraction and DBRs

5

in Table 1.

Ideal Bragg features do not emerge for all values of q ∈ [0.2, 0.5], when ǫa =

4(−1 + i0.001), µa = 1.02(−1 + i0.001), ǫb = 1, µb = 1 and N = 20. Thus, the Bragg

feature for q = 0.5 is not ﬂat–topped in Figure 3, although it is well–developed for

q = 0.6 and q = 0.7. Calculated values of ¯n as functions of q are shown in Table 1.

We note from the presented and related results that ¯n > 1 for all values of q ∈ (0, 1)
when Re[ǫa, µa] > 0. In contrast, 0 < ¯n < 1 for q <∼ 0.67 when Re[ǫa, µa] < 0. The

reduction of ¯n below the unit index of refraction of material b could suggest that the

real part of the index of refraction is negative for the subject artiﬁcial materials, but
that suggestion does not appear to be supported by the values of ¯n > 1 for q >∼ 0.67

when Re[ǫa, µa] < 0. Anyhow, in conjunction with Figure 3, Table 1 conﬁrms that

wave–material interaction in the subject artiﬁcial materials is intrinsically diﬀerent

from that in their conventional counterparts.

Our results also show that the Bragg regime would shift to shorter wavelengths,

if a conventional dielectric/magnetic constituent of a multilayer DBR were to be

replaced by its analog of the subject variety. Consequently, measurements of ¯n would

illuminate the issue of the negative index of refraction, and could also help in the

characterization of the subject artiﬁcial materials. At the same time, multilayer DBRs

made with the subject artiﬁcial materials could be useful in wavelength regimes that

are inaccessible with DBRs made with only conventional materials.

† Bragg feature has a curved top — exempliﬁed in the top plot of Figure 3 — which

begins to ﬂatten as N increases. There exists also a certain degree of arbitrariness in

the identiﬁcation of the Bragg feature for some values of q between ∼ 0.25 and ∼0.42

when Re[ǫa] = −4 and Re[µa] = −1.02.

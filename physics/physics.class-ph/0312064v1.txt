The optical refractive index of a moving regular medium is
calculated by using the Lorentz transformation in this note.
It is shown that in some velocity region of medium moving
relative to the initial frame K, the moving medium may pos-
sess a negative index of refraction measured by the observer
ﬁxed at the frame of reference K.

More recently, a class of artiﬁcial composite meta-
materials (termed “left-handed media”), which possess
the negative indices of optical refraction, attract exten-
sive attention in various areas such as applied electro-
magnetism, classical optics, materials science as well as
condensed matter physics [1–8]. Pendry et al.
sug-
gested that such left-handed materials can be designed
and fabricated by using both the array of long metallic
wires (ALMWs) [9] and the split ring resonators (SRRs)
[10,11]. A combination of the two structures yields a left-
handed medium. Apart from such artiﬁcial fabrications,
does there exist another alternative to the negative index
of refraction? In this note, I will demonstrate that a mov-
ing regular medium with a velocity in a suitable region
(associated with its rest refractive index n)1 possesses a
negative index of refraction, which may be a physically
interesting eﬀect and might deserve further discussion.

Suppose we have a regular anisotropic medium with
the rest refractive index tensor ˆn, which is moving rela-
tive to an inertial frame K with speed v in the arbitrary
directions. The rest refractive index tensor ˆn can be writ-
ten as ˆn = diag [n1, n2, n3] with ni > 0, i = 1, 2, 3. Thus
the wave vector of a propagating electromagnetic wave
with the frequency ω reads k = ω
c (n1, n2, n3) measured
by the observer ﬁxed at this medium. In this sense, one
can deﬁne a 3-D vector n = (n1, n2, n3), and the wave
vector k may be rewritten as k = n ω
c . Now we analyze
the phase ωt − k · x of the above time-harmonic electro-
magnetic wave under the following Lorentz transforma-

1The rest refractive index is just the one measured by the ob-
server ﬁxed at the regular/ordinary medium. In what follows,
we will derive the relativistic transformation for the optical
refractive index (tensor) of a moving medium.

Thus by using the transformation (1), the phase ωt−k·x

respectively.

To gain some insight into the meanings of the expres-
sion (3), let us consider the special case of a boost (of
the Lorentz transformation (1)) in the ˆx1-direction, in
which the medium velocity relative to K along the posi-
tive ˆx1-direction is v. In the meanwhile, we assume that

index of the medium in the ˆx1-direction is n, its (mov-
ing) refractive index in the same direction measured by
the observer ﬁxed at the initial frame K is of the form

which is a relativistic formula for the addition of “refrac-
tive indices” (− v
c provides an eﬀective index of refrac-
tion).

Note that here n′ observed in the frame K may be
negative. If, for example, when n > 1, the medium moves
at

c > v >

c
n

(and in consequence, k′ > 0, ω′ < 0); or when 0 < n < 1,
the medium velocity with respect to K satisﬁes

(6)

(and consequently, k′ < 0, ω′ > 0), then n′ is negative.
The former case where k′ > 0, ω′ < 0 is of physical inter-
est. In the paper [8], it was shown that the photon in the
negative refractive index medium behaves like its anti-
particle, which, therefore, implies that we can describe
the wave propagation in both left- and right- handed me-
dia in a uniﬁed way by using a complex vector ﬁeld [8].
In the above, even though we have shown that in some
certain velocity regions, the moving medium possesses
a negative n′, such a moving medium cannot be surely
viewed as a left-handed medium. For this point, it is nec-
essary to take into account the problem as to whether the
vector k, the electric ﬁeld E and the magnetic ﬁeld H of
the electromagnetic wave form a left-handed system or
not2. For simplicity and without the loss of generality,
we choose the electric and magnetic ﬁelds of the electro-
magnetic wave in the medium system as

E = (0, E2, 0) , B = (0, 0, B3) .

(7)

In the regular medium (right-handed medium with n >
0), the wave vector (along the positive ˆx1-direction with
the modulus k) and such E and B (or H) form a right-
handed system3. In the frame of reference K, according
to the Lorentz transformation, one can arrive at

E′

2 = γ (E2 − vB3) B′

3 = γ (cid:16)B3 − v

c2 E2(cid:17) .

For convenience, here we will think of the medium as an
isotropic one, i.e., the refractive index n′, permittivity ǫ′
and the permeability µ′ of the moving medium are all the
scalars rather than the tensors. First we consider the case
of Eq.(6) where k′ < 0, ω′ > 0. In order to let the moving
medium with a negative index of refraction be a real left-
handed one, the wave vector (k′ < 0), E′
3 of the
electromagnetic wave measured in K should form a left-
handed system. Because of k′ < 0 and B′
3 with
µ0 being the magnetic permeability in a vacuum, if µ′ is
negative4, then only the case of E′
3 > 0 (and
vice versa) will lead to the left-handed system5 formed

2 < 0 and B′

3 = µ′µ0H ′

2This requirement is the standard deﬁnition of a left-handed
medium. Apparently, it is seen that the two concepts left-
handed medium and negative refractive index medium is not
completely equivalent to each other.
3Thus if E2 > 0 is chosen to be positive, then B3 is also
positive. In what follows, we will adopt this case (i.e., E2 > 0
and B3 > 0) without the loss of generality.
4In the left-handed medium, the electric permittivity and
the magnetic permeability are simultaneously negative.
5Since k′ < 0, in order to form a left-handed system, the
signs of E′
3 should not be opposite to each other. So,
the signs of E′
3 should be opposite due to µ′ < 0.

by the wave vector (k′ < 0), E′

from Eq.(8) that when the medium velocity relative to K
is in the range

(10)

then the wave vector, electric ﬁeld and magnetic ﬁeld
measured in K will truly form a left-handed system.

In conclusion, if the medium velocity satisﬁes both
Eq.(6) and Eq.(9) or (10), then the moving medium will
be a left-handed one observed from the observer ﬁxed in
the initial frame K.

As far as the case of Eq.(5) where k′ > 0, ω′ < 0 is
concerned, it is also possible for the moving material to
become a left-handed medium. But the case of ω′ < 0 has
no the practical counterpart (at least in the real situation
where the artiﬁcial composite materials is designed). So,
we would not further discuss the case of ω′ < 0.

Although the subject of the present note seems to be
somewhat trivial, it is helpful for understanding the prop-
erties of wave propagation (such as causality problem, the
problem of energy propagating outwards and backwards
from source [12], etc.) in the left-handed medium.

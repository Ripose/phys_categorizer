CHARGED BROWN PARTICLE:
THE MORE RETARDATION IS
- THE LOWER IS THE EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE

The Brownian motion of a charged particle with ﬁnite size (described
by Sommerfeld model) is considered. It is found out that due to radiation
reaction: (1) the eﬀective temperature of such particle is lower, and (2) the
acceleration of the average velocity is smaller, then that for classical Brown
particle without electric charge.

Sommerfeld particle [1] is the model of a charged particle of ﬁnite size -
sphere with uniform surface charge Q and mechanical mass m. In nonrel-
ativistic approximation such sphere obeys the equation (see [2] and works,
cited there):

m ˙~v = ~Fext + η [~v(t − 2a/c) − ~v(t)]
~v = d ~R/dt,

(1)
here a - radius of the sphere, η = Q2
~R - coordinate of
3ca2 ,
the center of the shell, ~Fext - some external force. The term in RHS of
eq.(1), proportional to η, describes the eﬀect of radiation reaction (eﬀect of
retardation).

This model is a good tool to consider eﬀects of radiation reaction, free of

problems of classical point-like Lorentz-Dirac description (see, for ex.[3]).

A.

In this paper we consider Sommerfeld particle in the role of the Brown

1

particle, i.e. particle (with radiation reaction), moving in a stochastic path
under action of some external stochastic force ~Fstoch.

For simplicity we take that:
(1) the viscosity of the surrounding medium is zero;
(2) the statistical average of ~Fstoch - ~F0 - is non zero and constant in time

(3) particle moves in one dimension.
Under these assumptions the Langevin equation for Sommerfeld particle

t;

takes the form

m ˙v = Fstoch + η [v(t − 2a/c) − v(t)]

(2)

or for statistical average value < v > of v

m ˙< v > =< Fstoch > +η [< v > (t − 2a/c)− < v > (t)]

(3)

For dimensionless variables y =< v > /M,

x = ct/M (M -scale factor)

equation (3) takes the form

˙y = f + γ · [y(x − δ) − y(x)]

(4)

here

γ =

Q2M
3a2mc2 , f =

F0M
mc2 , δ =

2a
M

Classical analog of equation (4) for Brown point particle one can get taking
γ = 0 in (4).

Equation (4) for f = const has the exact solution

y = y0 + k · x

(5)

with k = f /(1 + γδ) and initial velocity y0.

Following the theory of Brownian motion ( there are many textbooks on
Brownian motion, see, for ex., [4]), the dispersion D =< (v− < v >)2 >
for surrounding medium without viscosity can be function of time: D =
D(t). The form of D(t) strongly depends on the form of correlation function
of stochastic force Fstoch and its concrete realization in computer program
( if correlation function is compact enough, then D(t) for ”not very large
moments of time t” is proportional to time: D(t) ∼ t - Einstein formula for

2

Brownian motion). If the dependence D = D(t) is known, one can try to
ﬁnd the form of correlation function, but this is not our goal.

Do not going into details, we can say that time average of D with respect
to the whole time of ”observation” T must be proportional (in dimensionless
variables) to the eﬀective temperature θ and inverse to the mass of particle:

θ
mc2 .
Solution (5) describes motion of charged particle with constant accelera-

tion. This result seems to be unusual.

Indeed, following classical electrodynamics, particle with acceleration must
radiate. Then one could expect that radiation, due to energy loss, leads to
radiation damping of particle motion.

Instead, we see that after statistical averaging, radiation reaction in Som-
merfeld form only changes the value of the eﬀective force, acting on particle,
making it smaller.

One can interpret this in the following way. Radiation reaction Frad in

Sommerfeld model is

Frad = γ · [y(x − δ) − y(x)]

on trajectory (5) it is nonzero and equals to −γδk . If δ - is small we can
expand the force Frad in powers of δ:

Frad = −kδ ˙y + k/2(δ)2¨y + ...

(7)

First term in (7) is the eﬀective electromagnetic mass of the particle, mul-
tiplied by acceleration with sign minus. On trajectory (5) this term equals to
−γδk. Second term in (7) is the radiation force in classical Lorentz form - on
trajectory (7) it is zero. Thus radiation eﬀects after statistical averaging lead
only to change in eﬀective particle mass (mechanic + electromagnetic) - it
becomes greater and the particle becomes more ”inertial” (more ”retarded”).
It looks like the energy of self-electromagnetic ﬁeld of a charged particle
does not radiate away, the ”electromagnetic fur-coat” does not get thin, thus
particle becomes ”heavier” (in comparison with particle of zero charge).

This eﬀect can also make the dispersion (6), i.e. the eﬀective Brownian

temperature smaller.

and

Dispersion (6), also as the particle motion, we investigated numerically.
The particle mass m and size a we take close to that of classical electron,
this yields γδ = 1 in (4).

The stochastic force Fstoch we extract step by step from the known pro-

cedure (see, for ex.,[5]):

φn+1 = {K · φn} ;

here brackets {...} denotes fractional part of ...,

(Fstoch)n · (M/mc2) = 10+3 · (φn − φ0)

with K = 100000/3 and φ0 = 0.5007645.
The results of numerical calculations can be summed in the following way:
(1) Sommerfeld particle in the role of the Brown particle has the eﬀective

temperature θS lower, than that for classical Brown particle θB: θS < θB.

(2) The more is the retardation (i.e. the greater is γ in (4) ), the greater

is the diﬀerence between θB and θS.

(3) The acceleration k of the average velocity of Sommerfeld particle is

smaller than that of classical Brown particle without electric charge.

These results are illustrated in Fig. 1, where y0 = 0.1; γ = 2000.0; δ =
2a/M = 1/2000.0; observation ”time” is 10.0005, with respect to it the
f = 4.881996 · 10−4 and the average
average value of stochastic force is
¯DB = 4.8496 · 10−8, i.e. θS < θB.
dispersions are ¯DS = 4.4359 · 10−8,

The upper curve - is the path of classical Brown particle (horizontal axis
- is ”time” x), the lower - is the path of Sommerfeld particle in the role of
Brown particle.

The acceleration of the average velocities for these particles diﬀers by
multiplier 2, as the consequence of the exact solution (5) ( for Brown particle
we have γ = 0, and k = f , for Sommerfeld - γδ = 1 and k = f /2).

These results conﬁrm numerically our considerations, made before.

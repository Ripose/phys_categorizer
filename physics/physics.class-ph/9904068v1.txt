We present an axiomatic framework for non-relativistic classical particle mechanics, inspired on Tati’s
ideas about a non-space-time description for physics. The main advantage of our picture is that it allows
us to describe causality without any reference to elapsed time intervals.

Abstract

Introduction

Before the famous experiment by Michelson and Morley in 1887, physicists believed that there should exist
an ether in space, in order to explain the propagation of electromagnetic waves, by means of the mechanical
theory of waves. However, that experiment showed that there is no relative motion of our planet with respect
to a physical medium usually refered to as the ether.

Now there is the belief that there should exist space-time as a medium which allows to order physical
events. The ‘new’ ether is a collection of physical properties of a continuum space-time (Einstein, 1991). In
this paper we propose a discrete picture for the dynamics in classical particle mechanics, where the continuum
has no physical meaning at all. We work on the possibility that the world is, in some sense, atomistic. And
space-time, as one of the constituents of the world, is also atomistic. We show that we may have causality
without any time interval, in the usual sense, between two events.

Some decades ago the japanese physicist T. Tati began a researche program about a description for physical
theories where the concepts of space and time are not primitive notions (Tati, 1964, 1983, 1986, 1987). For
a quick reference on his work see (Tati, 1986). For a detailed presentation of the non-space-time picture of
classical mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics (QED) see (Tati,
1964). Tati’s objective is to solve a speciﬁc problem, namely, the divergences in quantum ﬁeld theory. Tati
argues that it is possible to deﬁne space and time in some physical theories, by using the description proposed
by him. Space and time are fundamental concepts that should remain in classical physics. But in quantum
ﬁeld theories, the classical approach is meaningless. So, space and time do not exist at microscopic levels.
Tati’s work supports a theory of ﬁnite degree of freedom in QED, which allows to eliminate the divergences.
Although Tati’s motivation was a physical problem, we consider that a non-space-time description for
physical theories is also interesting from the philosophical point of view. The investigation of all logically

possible physical theories may conduct to a better understanding of the real role of fundamental concepts and
principles in physical theories. For example, we have recently showed how to deﬁne a set-theoretical predicate
(in the sense of P. Suppes’ (1967) program of axiomatization) for classical particle mechanics without the
concept of force (Sant’Anna, 1995; 1996), based on Hertz’s mechanics (Hertz, 1894; 1956). Now, we are
deﬁning an axiomatic framework for non-relativistic classical particles mechanics without space-time.

Thus, our work is in agreement with P. Suppes’ words about the role for philosophy in the sciences:

We are no longer Sunday’s preachers for Monday’s scientiﬁc workers, but we can participate in the
scientiﬁc enterprise in a variety of constructive ways. Certain foundational problems will be solved
better by philosophers than by anyone else. Other problems of great conceptual interest will really
depend for their solution upon scientists deeply immersed in the discipline itself, but illumination
of the conceptual signiﬁcance of the solutions can be a proper philosophical role. (Suppes, 1990).

Tati does not assume space-time as a primitive notion. Rather than space-time, he considers causality as

a primitive concept, whatever it does really mean.

We do not present in this paper all details of Tati’s theory because we consider his formulation a bit
confuse from the logico-mathematical standpoint. So, our starting point is the intuition presented in Tati’s
work which, we believe, is somehow preserved in our paper (at least in principle).

We venture to interpret Tati’s work at our own risk, as it follows. Physical observations may be associated
to elements of a discrete set which corresponds, intuitivelly speaking, to state measurement values. Each
observation is related to another one by a causal relation. This causal relation may be expressed by equations
which are very similar to numerical solutions of diﬀerential equations commonly used in physics. The notion
of a continuum space-time in theoretical physics allows the use of standard diﬀerential and integral calculus
on those equations. Space-time intervals, which are associated to elements of a continuum, should be regarded
as ‘unknowables’, if we use Tati’s terminology. Such unknowables behave like hidden variables in the sense
that we cannot actually measure real space-time intervals. Measurements do not have arbitrary precision. It
should also be emphasized that even measurements of mass, position, momentum, etc., should be associated
to elements of a discrete set of numbers, if we are interested to eliminate anthropomorphical notions like the
continuum and real numbers.

We recall the well known words by L. Kronecker: “God made the integers, all the rest is the work of man.”
In the next Section we present the axiomatic framework for classical particle mechanics by McKinsey,
Sugar and Suppes. In Section 3, a non-space-time description for classical particle mechanics is presented,
based on the formulation described in Section 2. In Section 4 we show that our description is consistent. In
Section 5 we discuss some possible applications of our picture, as well as other related lines for future works.

2 McKinsey-Sugar-Suppes Predicate for Classical Particle Mechan-

ics

This section is essentially based on the axiomatization for classical particle mechanics presented in (Suppes,
1957), which is a variant of the formulation in (McKinsey et al., 1953). We abbreviate McKinsey-Sugar-
Suppes System for Classical Particle Mechanics as M.S.S. system. Our intention is to apply Tati’s ideas on
the M.S.S. system in order to illustrate our non-space-time description of physics. We have chosen M.S.S.
system because it represents the simplest case of a physical theory ever axiomatized.

M.S.S. system has six primitive notions: P , T , m, s, f , and g. P and T are sets; m is a vector-valued unary
function deﬁned on P ; s and g are vector-valued binary functions deﬁned on the Cartesian product P × T ; and
f is a vector-valued ternary function deﬁned on the Cartesian product P × P × T . Intuitivelly, P corresponds
to the set of particles and T is to be physically interpreted as a set of real numbers measuring elapsed times

2

(in terms of some unit of time, and measured from some origin of time). m(p) is to be interpreted as the
numerical value of the mass of p ∈ P . sp(t), where t ∈ T , is a 3-dimensional vector which is supposed to be
physically interpreted as the position of particle p at instant t. f (p, q, t), where p, q ∈ P , corresponds to the
internal force that particle q exerts over p, at instant t. Finally, the function g(p, t) is to be understood as the
external force acting on particle p at instant t.

Now, we can give the axioms for M.S.S. system.

Deﬁnition 2.1 P = hP, T, s, m, f, gi is a M.S.S. system if and only if the following axioms are satisﬁed:

P1 P is a non-empty, ﬁnite set.

P2 T is an interval of real numbers.
P3 If p ∈ P and t ∈ T , then sp(t) is a 3-dimensional vector such that d2sp(t)
dt2
P4 If p ∈ P , then m(p) is a positive real number.

exists.

P5 If p, q ∈ P and t ∈ T , then f (p, q, t) = −f (q, p, t).

P6 If p, q ∈ P and t ∈ T , then [sp(t), f (p, q, t)] = −[sq(t), f (q, p, t)].
P7 If p, q ∈ P and t ∈ T , then m(p) d2sp(t)

dt2 = Pq∈P f (p, q, t) + g(p, t).

The brackets [,] in axiom P6 denote vector product.
Axiom P5 corresponds to a weak version of Newton’s Third Law: corresponding to every force there is
always a counterforce. Axioms P6 and P5, correspond to the strong version of Newton’s Third Law, since
axiom P6 establishes that the direction of force and counterforce is the direction of the line between particles
p and q.

Axiom P7 corresponds to Newton’s Second Law.

Deﬁnition 2.2 Let P = hP, T, s, m, f, gi be a M.S.S. system, let P ′ be a non-empty subset of P , let s′, g′,
and m′ be the functions s, g, and m with their ﬁrst arguments restricted to P ′, and let f ′ be the function f
with its domain P × P × T restricted to P ′ × P ′ × T . Then P ′ = hP ′, T, s′, m′, f ′, g′i is a subsystem of P if
the following condition is satisﬁed:

m′(p)

d2s′

p(t)
dt2 = X
q∈P ′

f ′(p, q, t) + g′(p, t).

(1)

Actually, in (Suppes, 1957), deﬁnition (2.2) does not have equation (1). On the other hand, such an

equation is really necessary to prove the following theorem:

Theorem 2.1 Every subsystem of a M.S.S. system is again a M.S.S. system.

Deﬁnition 2.3 Two M.S.S. systems

P = hP, T, s, m, f, gi

and

P ′ = hP ′, T ′, s′, m′, f ′, g′i
are equivalent if and only if P = P ′, T = T ′, s = s′, and m = m′.

3

Deﬁnition 2.4 A M.S.S. system is isolated if and only if for every p ∈ P and t ∈ T , g(p, t) = 0, where 0 is
the null vector.

Theorem 2.2 If

and

P = hP, T, s, m, f, gi

P ′ = hP ′, T ′, s′, m′, f ′, g′i

are two equivalent systems of particle mechanics, then for every p ∈ P and t ∈ T

X
q∈P

f (p, q, t) + g(p, t) = X
q∈P ′

f ′(p, q, t) + g′(p, t).

The imbedding theorem is the following:

Theorem 2.3 Every M.S.S. system is equivalent to a subsystem of an isolated system of particle mechanics.

3 Classical Particle Mechanics Without Space-Time

In this section we deﬁne a set-theoretical predicate for a classical particle mechanics system, inspired on
Tati’s ideas. By set-theoretical predicate we mean Suppes predicate (Suppes-1967). We are aware about the
limitations of particle mechanics, but that is not the point. The issue is Tati’s picture for physical theories.
Obviously we intend to apply these same ideas on other physical theories. But that is a task for future papers.
Our main goal in the present work is to give an axiomatic framework for a simple case of physical theory,
where space-time is not stated as one of the primitive notions. The simplest case of a physical theory, in our
opinion, is M.S.S. system.

In this paragraph we settle some notational features to be used in the paper from now on. We denote the
set of real numbers by ℜ, the set of integer numbers by Z, the set of positive integers by Z+ and the cartesian
products ℜ × ℜ × ℜ and Z × Z × Z, respectively by ℜ3 and Z3. When there is no risk of confusion, we say
that ℜ3 is a real vector space. We say that h is a (C0, τ )-function iﬀ h = h(τ ) and h is continuous with
respect to τ . Moreover, we say that h is a (Ck, τ )-function iﬀ h = h(τ ) and it is continuous and continuously
diﬀerentiable (with respect to τ ) k times.

Our system has sixteen primitive concepts: P , I, T , m, ¯s, ¯f , ¯g, s, v, f , g, cs, cv, cf , cg, and ct.

Deﬁnition 3.1 F = hP, I, T, m, ¯s, ¯f , ¯g, s, v, f, g, cs, cv, cf , cg, cti is a non-relativistic classical particle mechan-
ics system without space-time, which we abbreviate as CM-Tati’s system, if and only if the following axioms
are satisﬁed:

CM-1 P is a non-empty ﬁnite set;

CM-2 I ⊂ Z+;

CM-3 T is an interval of real numbers;

CM-4 m : P → Z+ is a function whose images are denoted by mp;

CM-10 ¯s : P × T → ℜ3 is a (C2, τ )-function whose images are denoted by ¯sp(τ ), satisfying the following

property: if there exists i ∈ I such that τ = ct(i), then ¯sp(τ ) = sp
i ;

CM-11 If there exists i ∈ I such that τ = ct(i), then d

dτ ¯sp(τ ) = vp
i ;

CM-12 ¯f : P ×P ×T → ℜ3 is a (C0, τ )-function whose images are denoted by ¯f pq(τ ), satisfying the following

i

;

CM-13 ¯g : P × T → ℜ3 is a (C0, τ )-funcion whose images are denoted by ¯gp(τ ), satisfying the following

property: if there exists i ∈ I such that τ = ct(i), then ¯gp(τ ) = gp
i ;

CM-14 For all p, q ∈ P and τ ∈ T we have ¯f pq(τ ) = − ¯f qp(τ );

CM-15 For all p, q ∈ P and τ ∈ T we have [¯sp(τ ), ¯f pq(τ )] = −[¯sp(τ ), ¯f qp(τ )];

CM-16 For all p, q ∈ P and τ ∈ T we have

mp d2¯sp(τ )

This paragraph follows with some aditional intuitive hints about our axioms. P corresponds to the set of
particles. Axiom CM-1 says that we are dealing only with a ﬁnite number of particles. Axiom CM-2 says
that I is a set of positive integers; intuitivelly, each i ∈ I corresponds to an observation. When we refer to
observations we talk about either performed observations or potentially performable(in a sense) observations.
Axiom CM-3 says that T is an interval of real numbers. The intuitive meaning of T is clariﬁed when we

5

discuss about the function ct. In M.S.S. system, T is interpreted as time. We say that mp, in axiom CM-
4, corresponds to the (inertial) mass of particle p, which is a positive integer number. Such a condition
demands an adequate measurement unit for mass, obviously diﬀerent from the usual units. sp
i in axiom CM-
5 corresponds to the position of particle p at the i-th observation, while vp
in axiom CM-6 is the speed of
i
particle p at observation i. In axiom CM-7 f pq
corresponds to the internal force that particle q exerts over
i
p, at the i-th observation. In the next axiom gp
is interpreted as the external force over p at observation i.
i
Function ct in axiom CM-9 is the correspondence that physicists make between their observations and the
working of an ideal (in some sense) chronometer, represented by T . It should be emphasized that we are not
imposing that ct is an injective function. That means that we may have causal relations without any passage
of a ‘time’ interval [0, τ ], which is a very common situation in quantum mechanics as well as in the usual
descriptions for classical mechanics. See, for instance, the problem of instantaneous actions-at-a-distance
dτ ¯s, ¯f and ¯g in axioms CM-10, CM-11, CM-12 and CM-13 are
in newtonian mechanics. Functions ¯s, d
extensions of, respectively, s, v, f and g. Such extensions allow us to use diﬀerential and integral calculus
dτ ¯s, ¯f , and ¯g when there is no
according to axiom CM-16, although there is no physical interpretation for ¯s, d
i ∈ I such that τ = ct(i). Axioms CM-14, CM-15 and CM-16 are analogous to axioms P5, P6 and P7 in
M.S.S. system. Functions cs, cv, cf and cg are called ‘causal relations’. The commutative diagram in axiom
CM-21 is necessary in order to state a sort of compatibility between the causal relations and positions, speeds
and forces. For those who are not familiar with the language of category theory, we say that the diagram in
axiom CM-21 commutes when γ ◦ c = ϕ ◦ γ, where ◦ referes to functions composition.

In the following theorems we denote the imbedding function by 1.

Theorem 3.1 The diagram

commutes, where α(p, i) = (p, ct(i)).

The commuting diagram in axiom CM-21 describes the dynamics of our discrete picture for physical
phenomena. Obviously, such a dynamics does not depend on time T . Nevertheless, the diagrams of theorems
(3.1), (3.2), (3.3) and (3.4) show the compatibility of the discrete picture and the continuous description given
in axioms CM-10 ∼ CM-16, which are in correspondence, in a certain sense, with some of the axioms of
M.S.S. system. Those diagrams suggest that the natural language for CM-Tati’s system is category theory.
It seems reasonable to describe the causal relations cs, cv, cf and cg as morphisms of a given category, whose
objects are in correspondence with the observations of sp

i , vp

i , f pq

i

and gp
i .

The deﬁnitions of subsystem, isolated system and equivalent systems, as well as the corresponding theorems

(see Section 2), can be easily stated.

4 CM-Tati’s System is Consistent

In this section we present a model for CM-Tati’s system. Axioms CM-1, CM-3 and CM-10∼CM-16 are
coincident with M.S.S. system assumptions up to function ct and to the fact that mass is a positive integer.
There is no trouble with respect to integer mass. We may assume M.S.S. system with integer masses as our
model. We also consider that ct is the imbedding function, if we make an appropriate choice for I and T
(I = {1, 2, 3, 4} and T = [1, 4], for example). Now, the question is: how to interpret functions s, v, f , g, cs,
cv, cf , and cg and the diagram given in axiom CM-21.

Let us consider f and g as constants with respect to i, i.e., ∀i∀i′((i ∈ I, i′ ∈ I) → (f pq

i′)),
where ∧ and ∀ stand, respectivelly, for the logical connective ‘and’ and the universal quantiﬁer. Consider also
that ¯f and ¯g are constants with respect to τ and that ∀i(i ∈ I → cf (sp
i ) =
gp
i ), i.e., f pq
i+1 = gp
i .

i+1 = f pq

i ∧cg(sp

i = f pq

i ) = f pq

and gp

Under these assumptions, the solution of the diﬀerential equation given in axiom CM-16 is:

This solution is valid, in particular, for integer values τ0 = i and τ = i + 1 according to our statement
that ct is the imbedding function. In this case it is easy to verify the commutativity of the diagram in axiom
CM-21 if we consider that sp
i ) is equivalent to equation (2) when τ = i + 1 and τ0 = i.
And adequate choice for the values of forces f and g, as well as to the mass m, will conduct to integer solutions
s of equation 2. That means that we should choose adequate measurement units for mass, force, speed and
position.

5 Final Remarks

There are some open problems related to our discrete picture for classical particle mechanics:

1. How to describe transformations of coordinates systems in Z3? What is a coordinate system in Z3?
Concepts like invariance and covariance should be revised. We know that Z3 may be taken as a free
Z-module, where Z is a ring, i.e., Z3 may have a basis and a respective dimension. We may also deﬁne
rotations and translations with respect to a given basis. Nevertheless, a group of transformations in this
discrete space is a task for future works.

2. How to extend such ideas to continuum mechanics? Is there any continuum mechanics in this picture?

3. How to extend our picture to quantum mechanics or quantum ﬁeld theory? That is an interesting point,
since in EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiment) we have an instantaneous and non-local interaction
between two elementary particles.
If we extend our picture to quantum physics we may be able to
explain EPR as a causal relation with no elapsed time interval, by considering that ct is not injective.
That does not violate special relativity if we consider that relativity holds only when ct is injective.

4. How to make a discrete picture for physical theories, without any reference to continuum spaces? It
is well known that Turing machines do not provide an adequate notion for computability in the set of
real numbers. If a discrete picture for physics is possible, some undecidable problems which are very
common in theoretical physics should disappear.

These questions cannot be answered in this paper. But we certainly intend to do it in future works.

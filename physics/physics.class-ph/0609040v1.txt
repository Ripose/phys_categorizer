Abstract - The minimum rate of entropy production (MREP) and the least
dissipation energy (LDE) principles are re-examined concerning continuous sys-
tems in stationary nonequilibrium states. By means of simple considerations on
coeﬃcients of phenomenological laws and by taking into account balance equa-
tions, an Onsager-like potential density for the stationary state is obtained. In
the case of a single state variable it is found that the potential density describes
a saddle-shaped surface around the stationary point in the domain of the force
(state variable) and the ﬂux. The saddle point may be considered a maximum
along a LDE path (ﬁxed force) and a minimum along a MREP path (ﬁxed phe-
nomenological coeﬃcient). The latter allow for the Glansdorﬀ-Prigogine local
potential.

1 Introduction

Thermodynamics establishes that, under certain conditions, systems in sta-
tionary nonequilibrium states (SNES) have a minimum rate of entropy produc-
tion (MREP) compatible with system constraints.[1]. The MREP principle (or
criterion) requires that linear phenomenological relations between generalized
ﬂuxes and forces hold. This condition is satisﬁed when slight deviations from
equilibrium take place uniformly in the whole system volume [2]. Beyond this
range some additional assumptions are required in order to apply a suitably
modiﬁed principle [3]. The matter is not so well deﬁned in continuous systems
when deviations from equilibrium are not uniformly distributed. Remaining
near equilibrium, several problems can be assessed successfully provided the
ﬂux laws are suitably linearized [4]. But in most case the linearization pro-
cedure presents some diﬃculties. Actually, according to statistical mechanics,
linear laws hold when local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) conditions are
satisﬁed [5]. But, in this case linearity is meant in the sense of deviations from
the local equilibrium. Thus, in general, phenomenological laws are not strictly
linear. The matter is further complicated by a certain freedom in the choice of
forces and conjugated ﬂuxes [6]. Thus, for example, in the case of heat conduc-
tion the MREP principle apparently works [5] or fails [7] according to the used
conventions.

Glansdorﬀ and Prigogine [1,8] formulated a general evolution criterion for
irreversible processes which is independent of the actual form of the phenomeno-
logical coeﬃcients. Based on this criterion, they devised a procedure to deﬁne a
(local) potential for the SNES which coincides (unless a numeric factor) with the

1

entropy production functional in the strictly linear range. Beyond this range,
the local potential allows for a (generalized) MREP principle provided certain
restrictions to the entropy production functional are assumed [9].

To give a thermodynamic framework to phenomenological laws, Onsager and
Machlup proved a least dissipation energy (LDE) principle for near-equilibrium
processes [10,11]. In the assumption of Gaussian behaviour of extensive state
variables, the nonequilibrium processes are Markovian. A system displaced
from equilibrium by a ﬂuctuation decays back to equilibrium by following, on
the average, the same empirical laws for the decay of the system displaced by
an external constraint [11]. According to this theory, the probability associated
with a given decay path is to be searched for by means of an extremum principle
of a suitable functional. The most probable path (with ﬁxed forces) is the one
established by phenomenological laws, i. e., by the LDE principle.

The theory developed by Onsager and Machlup has given insights for the
formulation of several Hamilton-based variational principles in the ﬁeld of hy-
drodynamics. We do not give accounts of the many works devoted to this topic
(see for example [9]). In this paper we are interested in the possible connection
between the Onsager (LDE) and the Glansdorﬀ-Prigogine (extended MREP)
principles for continuous systems. Speciﬁcally, we ask for a variational criterion
including both the two principles to give a uniﬁed and concise representation
of our knowledge about the SNES. To achieve its formulation we will pursue
a simple task: the criterion must account for the (entropy and mass) balance
equations regardless of the actual form of phenomenological coeﬃcients.

To deal with this matter the paper is planned as follows. In Section 2 we will
examine some features concerning the rate of entropy production as established
In section 3 we will derive the variational criterion for
by thermodynamics.
the SNES. The extremum properties of a functional dependent on forces (state
variables) and ﬂuxes will be investigated. In the simplest case of a single (state)
variable the density of the functional describes a saddle-shaped surface in the
domain of force and ﬂux. The extended MREP and LDE principles will be
apparent by restrictions of the potential to special deviation paths. In the ﬁeld
of thermodynamics, restriction of the functional to the MREP path allows for
the Glansdorﬀ-Prigogine local potential.

2 Entropy production

The deﬁnition of entropy production follows from the thermodynamic con-

struction of the local entropy balance equation [2,5]

where s stands for the speciﬁc entropy , ρ for mass density , JST OT for total en-
tropy ﬂux. The time derivative in the local frame is connected to the barycentric
derivative by the relation

− ∇ρsv

where v stands for the centre of mass velocity. By inserting eq. (2) in eq. (1)
we deﬁne entropy ﬂux

JS = JST OT − ρsv .

The starting point of the construction procedure is the Gibbs equation (assumed
to hold in LTE conditions) in which energy and mass balance equations have
been inserted. These latter read

∂ρi
∂t

+ ∇ (ji + ρiv) =

νij ξj

X

where ρi stands for the density of the i-th system component, ji for diﬀusion
ﬂow, νijξj is the rate of mass production of the i-th component in the j-th
chemical reaction with reaction rate ξj and stoichiometric coeﬃcient νij . The
entropy ﬂux can be written in general as

JS = JQ −

ϕi ji

i
X

where JQ stands for the heat ﬂux and ϕi for chemical (eventually electrochemical
[13]) potential of the i-th component. We are interested in those states where
the barycentric derivatives vanish. Moreover, we consider the case of mechanical
equilibrium where derivatives of υ vanish everywhere in the system [6]. In these
conditions, the density of entropy production is

j νijϕj stands for the aﬃnity of the set of reactions involved
where Γi =
in the production of the i-th component. When the centre of mass motion is
determined by ﬂows ji we have the condition
ji = 0. In this case the entropy
production should be re-written in order to present only independent ﬂows [12].
Equation (6) can be used, for example, to investigate thermoelectric processes
in semiconductors. In this case, chemical reactions are replaced by electron and
hole excitation processes.

Formally, σS can be written as a product of generalized ﬂuxes J and forces

where M = L−1. According to Curie’s theorem, phenomenological coeﬃcients
are scalars in isotropic systems so that only ﬂuxes and forces of the same vec-
torial (or tensorial) character are related. The requirement of microscopic time
reversibility of processes near equilibrium allow for symmetry of coeﬃcients as-
sociated with cross eﬀects (this does not hold in cases of magnetic and Coriolis
forces [6,12,14]) :

Lik = Lki

(10)

Owing to the detailed balance not all the possible deﬁnitions of forces and
conjugated ﬂuxes are allowed [6] ( two important conventions consider ”energy
transport per molecule” or the ”entropy transport per molecule” [15]). In this
connection, we point out that a variational principle correctly formulated must
not depend on theconvention adopted.

The entropy production of the whole system is

By considering the steady state as a reference state, the ﬁrst variation of P due
to small deviations of forces is

The second variation is

The latter is known as excess of entropy production [1]. If we consider equi-
librium as the reference state (X0k = 0;J0k = 0), we remain with δ(2)P =

which explains the MREP principle.

P
Let us we consider a simple example to clarify some points presented in the
introduction. The diﬀusion under uniform temperature (for simplicity’s sake
we do not consider the Doufour and Soret eﬀects) in absence of sources shows
σS = − (j/ρn) ∇ρ (we leave unspeciﬁed exponent n). A possible choice of the
force and the conjugated ﬂux is

To account for the right balance equation we require that dL/dρ = 0. The
latter condition appears excessively restrictive since in some important cases
(Fourier’s law , Fick’s law) L ∝ ρn . A better choice may be:

X = −∇ρ

J = j/ρn = −L

∇ρ

(16)

where L′ is a suitable constant coeﬃcient. However, this choice does not match
the transport features if the actual diﬀusion process requires L′ to be dependent
on variable ρ.

3 Stationary states beyond small deviations from equilibrium.

Henceforth, we will take SNES as the reference state from which deviations
of variables are considered. To represent deviations of ﬂuxes one can use ex-
pansions with respect to those of forces [1]. But in this way information about
phenomenological coeﬃcients are lost.
In a more conservative representation
deviations of coeﬃcients are explicitly considered. Thus, substituting the ex-
pansions

(17)

(20)

Xj (ρ) = X0j + δ(1)Xj (ρ) + δ(2)Xj (ρ) + ...

and

Lij (ρ) = L0ij + δLij (ρ) + δ(2)Lij (ρ) + ...

into eq. (8) we have at the ﬁrst order of deviations:

δ(1)Ji (ρ) =

L0ijδ(1)Xj (ρ) +

δ(1)Lij (ρ) X0j .

For convenience, in eqs (17) and (18) we have indicated the dependence on state
variables (for brevity symbolized by ρ) of all terms except the quantities X0j
and L0ij which pertain to the reference state. By taking into account that [1]

eqs (19) and (12) provide a way to represent SNES whatever conventions are
used. However, to include the LDE principle in our considerations we need a

present terms such as
eq. (24). by taking into account eq. (9) written for the stationary state. This

where the sums

as in eq. (20). Based on the foregoing considerations, we deﬁne the functional
Ψ[ρ, J] which has the form (23) but in which the function Jk (ρ) is replaced by
the variable Jk. Analogously, we follows the same rule to deﬁne the density
ψ(ρ, J) from eq. (24). Thus, the variational equation

P

δΨ = 0

(26)

(Ψ be stationary at the NESS) can be solved with respect to the state variables
(see eqs 17 to 19) or also with respect to the ﬂuxes. In this case, the associated
Eulero-Lagrange equations are

(∂ψ/∂Jl)SN ES = 0 .
which go back to the phenomenological laws at the SNES. The set of eqs (27)
devises a local extremum problem of the function ψ with respect to the ﬂuxes by
keeping the forces (state variables) ﬁxed to their reference state values. To assure
the existence of such an extremum it is suﬃcient for the quadratic form f (η) =
kl M0klηkηl to have a deﬁnite sign. In particular, ψ (ρ, J) has a maximum

(27)

(ﬁxed forces) if the quadratic form is positive deﬁnite.
P

In general, the functional Ψ does not show an extremum at SNES. However,
as seen above, we can search for some special variation paths, crossing the
SNES point in the domain of forces (state variables) and ﬂuxes where this can

be established in a restricted sense. To this end, we extend the problem (27)
to any set of ﬁxed forces lying within a small interval around the SNES point.
The locus of maxima thus found satisﬁes the relation

a local LDE principle, deviations (30) may be considered as ﬂuctuations from
the (SNES) local equilibrium. From substitution of eq. (29) into eq. (24) we
obtain

The same arguments presented for the problem (27) can be used for eq. (33).
If f (η) is positive deﬁnite it follows that δ(2)

minimum at the SNES. Thus the extremum properties of the functional Ψ[ρ, J]
along the two paths dealt with are determined uniquely by the sign of the form
f (η) which can be established only by thermodynamics. In this connection, we
note that functional (32) represent in a general form a Glansdorﬀ-Prigogine local
potential. Thus.
if the extended MREP principle establishes the minimum of

Let us consider the simplest case of a functional dependent on a single state

variable. In the domain {X, Z} we have ψ = JX − (1/2)M0J 2 where M0 > 0

shaped surface where the saddle point {X0, J0} is a maximum along the path

of the heat conduction we have X = −∇(1/T ) and L = λ(T )T 2 where λ(T )

functional is

4 Final remarks and conclusions

We still remark that the variational equation (26) stands on the condition
of having ﬁxed state variables at the system boundary. We can remove this
condition by considering a surface integral such that [8].

We need not modify anything in the conclusion of the previous section concern-
ing the extremum properties of the functional Ψ. Indeed, eq. (34) holds at any
variation order so that the second variation of the modiﬁed functional coincides
with δ(2)Ψ.

In the case grad υ 6= 0 we must include the viscoelastic term in the entropy
production [5,12]. In this connection we point out that υ cannot be considered
as a functional variable. This is because the variational criterion (26) is closely
related to the entropy conservation law and does not account for momentum
conservation. Thus, the functional (32), as it stands, cannot be used in the ﬁeld
of hydrodynamics. We need not go further in this matter which is beyond the
scope of this paper.

We have shown that in continuous systems satisfying LTE conditions, the
(extended) MREP and (local) LDE principles are connected by means of a
suitable functional.
In the case of a single state variable, the density of the
functional describes a saddle-shaped surface in the force-ﬂux domain. The sad-
dle point represents the stationary state. The MREP path is the one where
the phenomenological coeﬃcient maintains its reference state (SNES) value. In-
stead, the LDE path is the one where the force is kept ﬁxed.
In particular,
along the MREP path the functional behaves as a Glansdorﬀ-Prigogine local
potential.

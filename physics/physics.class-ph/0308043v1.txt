Abstract: The time–harmonic electromagnetic responses of (a) a bilayer made of an

epsilon–negative layer and a mu–negative layer, and (b) a single layer of a negative phase–

velocity material are compared. Provided all layers are electrically thin, a restricted

equivalence between (a) and (b) exists. The restricted equivalence depends on the lin-

ear polarization state and the transverse wavenumber. Implications for perfect lenses and

parallel–plate waveguides are considered.

Key words: Negative real permittivity, Negative real permeability, Negative phase veloc-

ity, Parallel–plate waveguide, Perfect lens, Phase velocity, Poynting vector

Introduction

This communication is inspired by the ongoing spate of papers published on the inap-

propriately designated left-handed materials which are macroscopically homogeneous and

display negative phase velocities in relation to the time–averaged Poynting vector, but

are not chiral [1]. Nominally, such a material is deemed to possess a relative permittivity
scalar ǫr = ǫ′
the angular frequency ω, such that both ǫ′

r , both dependent on
r < 0 in some spectral regime.2

r and a relative permeability scalar µr = µ′

r < 0 and µ′

r + iµ′′

r + iǫ′′

Originally conceived by Veselago [3], these materials have been artiﬁcially realized quite

recently [4, 5]. Their fascinating electromagnetic properties can have technological impli-

cations of massive proportions [6], but those implications remain speculative at this time.

Although these materials have been variously named [1], we prefer the name negative

phase–velocity (NPV) materials as the least ambiguous of all extant names.

Using transmission–line analysis and lumped parameters, Alu and Engheta [7] have

recently suggested a new route to realizing NPV materials: Take a thin layer of an epsilon–

negative (EN) material:

it has a negative real permittivity scalar but a positive real

permeability scalar. Stick it to a thin layer of a mu–negative (MN) material, which has

a negative real permeability scalar and a positive real permittivity scalar. Provided the

two layers are suﬃciently thin, the paired EN–MN layers could function eﬀectively as a

NPV material. The clear attraction of this scheme is that EN and MN layers are easier

to manufacture, very likely, than the NPV materials fabricated thus far [4, 5].

Our objective here is to examine the suggested scheme using continuum ﬁeld theory, and

to establish a restricted equivalence of an EN–MN bilayer to a NPV material. Implications

2 Bilayer Theory in Brief

Consider the layers 0 < z < da and da < z < da + db. Their constitutive relations are as

D(r) = ǫ0ǫa E(r)

B(r) = µ0µa H(r)

D(r) = ǫ0ǫb E(r)
B(r) = µ0µb H(r)

0 < z < da ,

da < z < da + db .

The constitutive parameters present in the foregoing equations are complex–valued with

positive imaginary parts (as beﬁts any passive medium). The two half–spaces on either

sides of the bilayer are vacuous.

Without loss of generality, the electromagnetic ﬁeld phasors everywhere can be written

E(r) = ˜e(z) eiκx

H(r) = ˜h(z) eiκx

where the transverse wavenumber κ ∈ [0, ∞). The ﬁelds inside the bilayer must follow

The only nonzero elements of the matrixes Pa,b appear on their antidiagonals, of which

the (2, 3) and the (3, 2) elements are relevant to s–polarized ﬁelds, and the (1, 4) and the

(4, 1) elements to the p–polarized ﬁelds.

The solution of (4) is straightforward, because the matrix P(z) is piecewise uniform

[12]. Thus, the algebraic relation

[f (db + da)] = eiPbdb eiPada [f (0)]

(7)

is suﬃcient to solve both reﬂection/transmission problems as well as guided–wave prop-

agation problems. The two matrix exponentials on the right side of (7) cannot be inter-

changed — unless the matrixes Pa and Pb also commute, which is possible with dissimilar

materials only in quite special circumstances [10, 11].

3 Analysis

Matrixes Pa,b have ±

k2
0ǫa,bµa,b − κ2 = ±αa,b as their eigenvalues. Provided that |αa,b| da,b ≪

1 (i.e., both layers are electrically thin), the approximations

q

eiPa,bda,b ≃ I + iPa,bda,b

(8)

can be made, with I as the 4×4 identity matrix. Then

eiPbdb eiPada ≃ I + iPada + iPbdb ≃ eiPada eiPbdb ,

(9)

and the two layers in the bilayer can be interchanged without signiﬁcant eﬀect [13].

Let us now consider a single layer of relative permittivity ǫeq, relative permeability µeq

and thickness deq. Quantities Peq and αeq can be deﬁned in analogy to Pa and αa. Two

thickness ratios are deﬁned as

pa,b =

≥ 0 ,

da,b
deq

in order to compare the single layer with the previously described bilayer. There is no

hidden restriction on the non–negative real numbers pa and pb.

Provided that |αeq| deq ≪ 1 (i.e., the single layer is electrically thin as well), the ap-

proximation

eiPeqdeq ≃ I + iPeqdeq

can be made. Equations (9) and (11) permit us to establish the following equivalences

between a bilayer and a single layer:

(i) s–polarization: The only nonzero ﬁeld components are Ey, Hx and Hz. Therefore,

the equality of the (2, 3) elements of paPa + pbPb and Peq, and likewise of the (3, 2)

elements, has to be guaranteed for equivalence; thus, the equations

paµa + pbµb = µeq ,

(ii) p–polarization: The only nonzero ﬁeld components being Hy, Ex and Ez, the equality

of the (1, 4) elements of paPa + pbPb and Peq suﬃces, along with the equality of the

(4, 1) elements of the two matrixes. For a given value of κ and subject to the thickness

restrictions |αa,b,eq| da,b,eq

<∼ 0.1, the bilayer and a single layer are equivalent if

µeq = paµa + pbµb

ǫeq = paǫa + pbǫb .

Clearly, the constitutive parameters of the equivalent layer are functions of both pa and pb;

and we must point out that the sum of these two ratios need not equal unity. Furthermore,

except for normal incidence (i.e., κ = 0), the constitutive parameters of the equivalent layer

depend on the incident linear polarization state. Finally, the constitutive parameters of

the equivalent layer change with the transverse wavenumber κ.

The foregoing equations can be manipulated to yield negative values of both ǫ′

eq and

µ′
eq for either

• an EN–MN bilayer {ǫ′

a < 0, ǫ′

b > 0, µ′

a > 0, µ′

b < 0} or

• a MN–EN bilayer {ǫ′

a > 0, ǫ′

b < 0, µ′

a < 0, µ′

b > 0}.

An EN–MN bilayer is equivalent to a NPV layer for both polarization states when κ = 0,

provided the condition

(18)

holds true. The inequality (18) is applicable for a MN–EN bilayer also, if the subscripts a

The inequalities (18)–(21) should be adequate for both s– and p–polarization states

when κ/k0 ≪ 1. In general, however, a given EN–MN (or MN–EN) bilayer is equivalent

to a diﬀerent NPV material for a diﬀerent linear polarization state and/or transverse

wavenumber. Thus, the equivalence between an EN–MN (or a MN–EN) bilayer and a

NPV layer is restricted.

The restricted equivalence has an interesting implication for perfect lenses [8]. A perfect

lens of thickness d > 0 is deﬁned by the fulﬁllment of the condition [f (d)] = [f (0)] for

all ω and κ. Because of dispersion and dissipation, at best, this condition is fulﬁlled

approximately. Let us imagine that the condition is fulﬁlled by some NPV constitutive

parameters for some ω and all |κ| ≤ ˆκ. Then, the implementation of the acceptably

imperfect lens as a cascade of thin EN-MN (or MN–EN) bilayers would require that the

successive bilayers have diﬀerent constitutive parameters and that the entry as well as the

exit faces be curved, and even those steps may not suﬃce. In contrast, κ is ﬁxed for any

single–mode parallel–plate waveguide, and so is the range of operating frequencies; and

the emulation of a NPV material via EN–MN (or MN–EN) bilayers may not be onerous.

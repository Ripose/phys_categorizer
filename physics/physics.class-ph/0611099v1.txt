It is shown that the magnetic force between thin, semi-inﬁnite solenoids obeys a Coulomb-type
law, which corresponds to that for magnetic monopoles placed at the end points of each solenoid.
We derive the magnetic Coulomb law from the basic principles of electromagnetism, namely from
the Maxwell equations and the Lorentz force.

I.

INTRODUCTION

A permanent magnet is an ensemble of microscopic
magnetic moments which are oriented along the magne-
tization direction. A magnetic moment can be modeled
as a dipole, i.e., as a slightly displaced pair of magnetic
monopoles with opposite polarities. It is analogous to the
electric dipole. Another way of modeling is to consider
each magnetic moment as a circulating current loop. In
terms of far ﬁelds, the dipole model and the loop-current
model give exactly the same magnetic ﬁeld. The lat-
ter model is more natural because there are no magnetic
monopoles found so far and microscopic magnetic mo-
ments are always associated with kinetic rotations such
as orbital motions or spins of electrons. It also provides
correct symmetries with respect to the time and space
inversions.

Normally we are interested in macroscopic quantities,
which are obtained by coarse-graining of microscopic
ﬁelds and source distributions1. When we coarse-grain
the oriented ensemble of microscopic magnetic dipoles in
a bar magnet, we have a magnetic north pole at one end
and a south pole at the other end as shown in Fig. 1(a).
Contributions of the magnetic charges inside are canceled
out through the spatial average.

On the other hand, when we coarse-grain the micro-
scopic loop currents, we have macroscopic current which
circulates around the bar along the surface as shown in
Fig. 1(c). By mimicking the macroscopic current distri-
bution by a coil, we have an electromagnet that is equiv-
alent to the permanent magnet. In this model, the poles,
or the ends of bar magnet play no special roles. Again
the current model is much more reasonable because of
the similarity with the equivalent electromagnet.

The use of the notion of magnetic pole should be
avoided as far as possible2 because of its absence in the
framework of electromagnetic theory or in the Maxwell
equations. Practically, however, magnetic poles are very
convenient to describe the forces between permanent
magnets or magnetized objects. The poles are consid-
ered as an ensemble of monopoles and the forces be-
tween poles are calculated with the magnetic Coulomb
law, which is usually introduced just as an analog of the
electric Coulomb law or as an empirical rule5. For logical
consistency, we have to derive the magnetic Coulomb law

from Maxwell’s equations and the Lorentz force, none of
which contain the notion of magnetic monopoles.

The derivation of magnetic Coulomb’s law was given
more than forty years ago by Chen3 and Nadeau4.
In
this paper a more detailed analysis based directly on the
fundamental laws will be provided. The ﬁeld singularity
for inﬁnitesimal loop currents, which plays crucial roles
but was not mentioned in the previous works, will be
treated rigorously.

II. CURRENT DENSITY FOR A THIN
SOLENOID

For brevity, we introduce a scalar function G0 and a

vector function G1 of position r = (x, y, z):

G0(r) =

, G1(r) =

(1)

4π|r|

r
4π|r|3 .

We note that ∇G0 = −G1 and ∇ · G1 = δ3(r) hold,
where δ3(r) = δ(x)δ(y)δ(z) is the three dimensional delta
function. With these, the scalar potential for a point
charge q placed at the origin is φ(r) = (q/ε0)G0(r), and
the force acting on a charge q1 at r1 from another charge
q2 at r2 is F 1←2 = (q1q2/ε0)G1(r1 − r2). The Biot-
Savard law can be expressed as dH = dC ×G1(r), where

as a magnetic dipole, the corresponding macroscopic picture
is two opposite magnetic poles at each end (a). If we adopt
the current loop model for magnetic moment, the macroscopic
picture consists of circulating current around the side wall (c).

dC = Idl is a current moment (current I times length

As shown in Fig. 2, a thin solenoid can be constructed
as a stack of tiny loop currents at least in principle6. The
current density for an inﬁnitesimal loop current place at
the origin is

J m(r) = (−m × ∇)δ3(r)

(2)

where m is the magnetic moment for the loop current and
its unit is (A m2) (See Appendix). To form a solenoid we
stack these tiny loop currents along a curve La with a
constant line density κa (loops per unit length). Each
loop are aligned so that the direction of tangent of curve
and that of m coincide.

The current density distribution for a line segment

dla ( k dm ) is

dJ(r) = (−Cadla × ∇)δ3(r − ra),

(3)

D
∼ A m is the magnetic moment per unit
where Ca = κam
length and characterizes the strength of the solenoid7,
where m = m · dla/|dla| is the magnitude of m and ra
represents the position of the segment dla.

III. FIELD BY A THIN, SEMI-INFINITE
SOLENOID

Here we introduce an important formula. For a con-

stant vector α and a vector ﬁeld V (r), we have

(α × ∇) × V − α × (∇ × V )

= (α · ∇)V − α(∇ · V ).

(4)

With the Biot-Savard law and Eq. (2), we can ﬁnd
the strength of magnetic ﬁeld generated by a magnetic
moment m placed at the origin as

Hm(r) =

Z

dv′J m(r′) × G1(r − r′)

= (−m × ∇) × G1(r),

(5)

where dv′ is a volume element at r′ and ∇′
Using Eq. (4), it can be rewritten as

= ∂/∂r′.

Hm(r) = −(m · ∇)G1(r) + mδ3(r),

(6)

where the relations ∇ · G1(r) = δ3(r) and ∇ × G1 = 0
have been used. As shown in Appendix, Eq. (6) can also
be derived from the Maxwell equations.

It is well known that the ﬁeld for an electric dipole
moment p is D(r) = −(p · ∇)G1(r), which contains no
delta-function terms unlike Eq. (6). This means that in
terms of near ﬁelds, the dipole and the current loop do
not yield the same ﬁeld.

From Eq. (6), the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld created

by a line segment dla is

dH(r) = (Cadla · ∇a)G1(r − ra) + Cadlaδ3(r − ra)

(7)

(8)

where ∇a = ∂/∂ra. The integration along a curve La
yields the magnetic ﬁeld created by the solenoid:

H(r) =

dH = Ca [G1(r − r1) − G1(r − r2)]

ZLa
+ Ca ZLa

δ3(r − ra)dla,

where r2 and r1 are the start and the end points of
La. The second term of the right-hand side, which cor-
responds to the magnetic ﬂux conﬁned in the solenoid,
vanishes outside. For semi-inﬁnite cases (r2 = ∞), we
have

H(r) = CaG1(r − r1) + Ca ZLa

δ3(r − ra)dla.

(9)

The ﬁrst term of the right-hand side, which represents
the magnetic ﬁeld outside of the solenoid, is equivalent
to the ﬁeld for a monopole ga = µ0Ca located at r1:

B(r) = gaG1(r − r1) =

ga
4π

r − r1
|r − r1|3 .

(10)

The dimension of ga,

ga = µ0Ca

correctly corresponds to that for the magnetic charge.
The magnetic ﬂux ga conﬁned along the solenoid fans out
isotropically from the end point r1. As seen in Fig. 2, a
thin, semi-inﬁnite solenoid can be viewed as a magnetic
monopole located at the end.

IV. MAGNETIC FORCE ACTING ON A
SEMI-INFINITE SOLENOID

From Eq. (2), we see that the Lorentz force acting on
a tiny loop current m placed at r in a magnetic ﬁeld B
is

F m =

Z

dv′J m(r′) × B(r + r′)

= (m × ∇) × B(r).

(12)

Using Eq. (4) and the conditions for magnetic ﬁeld: ∇ ·
−1
B = 0 (divergence-free) and ∇ × (µ
0 B) = 0 (rotation-
free), the expression can be modiﬁed as

F m = (m · ∇)B(r),

(13)

which is suitable for line-integral. Equation (12) can also
be modiﬁed as F m = ∇(m · B) with the divergence-free
condition only. The rotation-free condition is satisﬁed
only when the right hand side of the Maxwell-Amp`ere
equation, ∇ × H = J + ∂D/∂t, vanishes.

Thus the magnetic force acting on a line element dlb

at rb is

dF = (Cbdlb · ∇b)B(rb),

(14)

where Cb = κbm and ∇b = ∂/∂rb. Integration along a
curve Lb yields the total force acting on the solenoid;

F =

ZL

dF = Cb ZL
= Cb [B(r3) − B(r4)] ,

b

b

(dlb · ∇b)B

(15)

where r4 and r3 are the initial and end points of Lb,
respectively. For semi-inﬁnite cases [B(r4 = ∞) = 0],
we have

F = CbB(r3) = gbH(r3),

(16)

with H = µ
magnetic charge gb = µ0Cb placed at r3.

−1
0 B. This is equal to the force for a point

It is surprising that the sum of the forces acting on each
part of the solenoid can be represented in terms only of
the magnetic ﬁeld B(r3) at the end point r3. This is
because the partial force is proportional to the (vector)
gradient of the magnetic ﬁeld.

V. COULOMB’S LAW BETWEEN TWO THIN,
SEMI-INFINITE SOLENOIDS

Now we can calculate the force (16) on solenoid b by

the ﬁeld (9) generated by solenoid a;

F b←a = CbB(r3) = Cbµ0H(r3)

= µ0CbCaG1(r3 − r1).

(17)

This equation corresponds to Coulomb’s law for magnetic
charges ga at r1 and gb at r3:

F 3←1 =

G1(r3 − r1) =

gagb
µ0

gagb
4πµ0

r3 − r1
|r3 − r1|3 .

(18)

These two equations are exactly the same but the for-
mer is for the total (integrated) force between currents
of solenoids and the latter is for the force between mag-
netic point charges.

It is interesting that the force is independent of the
paths of either solenoids as long as their end points and
strengths are kept constant. We should note that the
derivation of the magnetic Coulomb law is not straight-
forward. The properties of static, source-free ﬁelds must
be utilized.

VI. TORQUE ON A SEMI-INFINITE SOLENOID

Now we are interested in the torque due to the inte-
grated magnetic force on a thin, semi-inﬁnite solenoid.
The torque N m with respect to the origin exerted on a
loop current m located at r is4

N m =

Z

dv′(r + r′) × [J m(r′) × B(r + r′)]

) × J m(r′

)] × r′

(19)

where the ﬁrst term corresponds to the torque due to the
total force F m with respect to the origin and the second
term corresponds to the torque with respect to the center
of the loop current. Using Eq. (13), the former can be
modiﬁed as

N (0)

m = r × F m = r × (m · ∇)B

= (m · ∇)(r × B) − [(m · ∇)r] × B
= (m · ∇)(r × B) − m × B,

(20)

with (m · ∇)r = m. The latter can be simpliﬁed as

the torque exerted on a thin, semi-inﬁnite solenoid coin-
cides with that for a point magnetic charge gb = µ0Cb
place at r3.

VII. DISCUSSION

In this paper we only deals with thin solenoids.
Solenoids with ﬁnite cross-section can be represented as a
bundle of thin solenoids. Similarly a permanent magnet
can naturally be modeled as a bundle of thin solenoids.
The degree of magnetization of magnets or magnetized
objects is characterized by the quantity called macro-
D
scopic magnetization, M
∼ A/m, which is deﬁned as
∼ A m2. The
volume density of magnetic moments, m
magnetization can also be represented as area-density of
thin solenoids. We remember that a thin solenoid is char-
D
∼ A m. Bundling ν
acterized by the current moment, C
∼ /m2), we can create the mag-
solenoids per unit area (
netization M = νC.

In conclusion, we have shown that the force between
thin, semi-inﬁnite solenoids obeys the Coulomb law that
is for the equivalent magnetic point charges placed at
each end of solenoid. We have also shown that the torque
exerted on the solenoid in a magnetic ﬁeld coincides with
that for a corresponding magnetic point charge.
It is
convenient to introduce magnetic charges or poles be-
cause the magnetic Coulomb law can easily be applied
for forces between them. But we should remember that
without the justiﬁcation given in this paper it is just a
rough and ready method.

by a pair of small vectors, a and b. The center is located
at the origin and current I is circulating along the edge.
The current distribution on the four segments can be
approximately represented as

J I(a×b)(r) =I

aδ3(−b/2) + bδ3(a/2)
(cid:2)
− aδ3(b/2) − bδ3(−a/2)
(cid:3)

(A.1)

In the limit of |a|, |b| → 0 with m = I(a × b) being kept
constant, it approaches

J m(r) = I

−a(b · ∇)δ3(r) + b(a · ∇)δ3(r)
(cid:3)

(cid:2)

= [−I(a × b) × ∇]δ3(r)
= (−m × ∇)δ3(r),

(A.2)

and Eq. (2) is obtained. The derivative of the delta func-
tion ∇δ3(r) serves as a diﬀerential operator when it is
integrated together with other functions as in 1D cases:
dxf (x)(d/dx)δ(x) = −(df /dx)(0) . For example, the

magnetic force on m can be calculated as follows;
R

F m =

dv(−m × ∇)δ3(r) × B(r)

−∇δ3(m · B) + m(∇δ3 · B)
(cid:3)

(cid:2)

= [∇(m · B) − m(∇ · B)]r=0
= [(m × ∇) × B] (0).

(A.3)

Next we derive Eq. (6) from Maxwell’s equations. The
Amp`ere law for an inﬁnitesimal loop current, ∇ × H =
J m can be written as

∇ ×

H(r) − mδ3(r)
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

= 0.

(A.4)

We know that a rotation-free ﬁeld can be represented as
a gradient of some scalar ﬁeld φm(r) as

H(r) − mδ3(r) = −∇φm(r).

(A.5)

Taking the divergence of each side, we have

(∇ · m)δ3(r) = ∇2φm(r),

(A.6)

where ∇ · (µ0H) = 0 has been used. Comparing it with

∇2(∇ · m)G0(r) = −(∇ · m)δ3(r),

(A.7)

which is obtained from ∇2G0(r) = −δ3(r), we ﬁnd the
solution of (A.6) to be

φm(r) = −(∇ · m)G0(r).

(A.8)

APPENDIX: CURRENT DENSITY AND FIELD
OF A TINY CURRENT LOOP

With Eq. (A.5) and ∇G0 = −G1 we have Eq. (6):

The current density (2) for a tiny current loop can be
derived as follows. We consider a parallelogram deﬁned

which can be conﬁrmed to satisfy the Maxwell equations.

H(r) = −(m · ∇)G1(r) + mδ3(r),

wire not as a stack of closed wire loops. The diﬀerence in
current distribution, which can be represented as an addi-
tional current along the solenoid, can be made arbitrarily
small by reducing the wire current and increasing the num-
ber of winding correspondingly.

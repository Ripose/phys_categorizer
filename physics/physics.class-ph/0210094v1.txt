Abstract

We give analytical explanations of the so-called Parrondo eﬀect in Brownian ratchets. Flashing

ratchets, a form of Brownian ratchets, have recently been given a game-theoretical formulation

in so-called Parrondo games. These are simple coin-ﬂipping games with negative expected value

that combine into a game with positive expected value. By identifying the previously neglected

Parrondo game state parameter, we are able to show that it is possible to obtain a winning game

by merely adjusting the state transition probabilities. Our model shows that the Parrondo eﬀect

is the result of tacit interaction between the Parrondo game constituents.

INTRODUCTION

Flashing ratchets, a form of Brownian ratchets, have recently been given a game-

theoretical formulation in so-called Parrondo games. A Parrondo game is a combination

of two or more simple games in which possibly biased coins are ﬂipped, each with zero or

negative expected value, a strategy for alternation between the simple games, and a state.

The state determines the probabilities of winning in one or more of the simple games and

codes the game history, including the capital of one or more players of the Parrondo game.

A winning strategy yields a positive expected value of the Parrondo game, in spite of the

constituent simple games having negative expected value: the so-called Parrondo eﬀect.

Conditions for the simple games and for the strategies (and implicitly also for the Parrondo

game states) were ﬁrst given by Parrondo et al. [1] and the area was recently surveyed in [2].

We give analytical explanations to results previously only approximated by computer sim-

ulations and often claimed counter-intuitive [3], as well as provide an explicit explanation

utilizing the Parrondo game state parameter, of the Parrondo eﬀect.

The original Parrondo game rules [4] combined two games, of which the second was

later modiﬁed to “present new games where all the rules depend only on the history of the

game and not on the capital” [5]. We begin by analyzing this modiﬁed game, named B′,

demonstrating that although the ergodic expected value of B′ is negative, it is possible to

obtain a winning game by adjusting the state transition probabilities in the game in which

B′ is mixed with the original Parrondo game named A. We then calculate the optimal

strategy for the mixed game. Finally, we analyze the original Parrondo game in an analysis

that requires the introduction of a new state parameter: the capital of the player.

GAME B′

The set of possible outcomes of game B′ is Ω = {−1, 1}, also called losing and winning.

The game history gt ∈ Ω is the outcome of game B′ at time t. The probabilities of the

outcomes depend on the game history in the following way

p1|1,−1 = p1|−1,1 = 1/4 − ǫ

(1)

p1|−1,−1 = 9/10 − ǫ

p1|1,1 = 7/10 − ǫ

where we use the notation

pt
ijk···

.
= P rob[gt = i, gt−1 = j, gt−2 = k, . . .]

for the time dependent distribution, pijk··· for the ergodic distribution where pt

ijk··· = pt−1

ijk···,

and

pi|j··· =

pij···
pj···

For example, the probability of winning after having lost two simple games is 9/10-ǫ.

GAME B′ HAS NEGATIVE EXPECTED VALUE

For the ergodic process, it holds that

pij = X
k∈Ω

pi|jkpjk, X
(i,j)∈Ω2

pij = 1

(2)

The linear system (1) and (2), has the following solution.

p−1,−1 =

p1,−1 = p−1,1 =

p1,1 =

45 + 210ǫ + 200ǫ2
198 + 220ǫ
27 + 60ǫ − 100ǫ2
99 + 110ǫ
45 − 230ǫ + 200ǫ2
198 + 220ǫ

The ergodic expected value of the game is:

Thus, the game has negative expected value for ǫ > 0.

MIXING SIMPLE GAMES

Mixed with another game, B′ can have a higher expected value because the outcome

probabilities depend on the Parrondo game history g∗

t rather than the simple game history gt.

Eq. (3) shows that if it holds for the Parrondo state transition probabilities that p∗

1,1 ≥ p1,1

and p∗

−1,−1 ≥ p−1,−1, then hg∗

t i ≥ hgti.

The original biased coin-ﬂipping game has outcome 1 with probability q1 = 1/2 − ǫ, and

outcome -1 otherwise (see [4]), and was in [5] mixed with B′. g∗

t is with probability u = 1/2
the outcome of the original game, otherwise it is the outcome of B′. The mixed game has

positive expected value, i.e. hg∗

t i > 0 for some ǫ > 0. The fact the simple game B′ in
this mixed game also has positive expected value goes unnoticed in [5]. More speciﬁcally,

the negatively biased coin-ﬂipping original game increases the probability p∗

−1,−1 for two

consecutive losses in the mixed game, which in turn increases the expected value of the

game B′ enough to compensate for the loss suﬀered from the other simple game. For the

mixed game p∗

ij it holds that

ij = u2qiqj + u(1 − u)p∗
p∗

i|jqj + u(1 − u)qip∗

j + (1 − u)2p∗

since p∗

ij depends on both of the simple games. The linear system Eq. (1), (5) and (6) has

for u = 1/2 the solution

where C = 54220 + 21120ǫ. This results in a positive expected value of the Parrondo game

The positive expected value is simply and intuitively due to changing the weights pij in the

weighted sum in Eq. (3), which shows the tacit dependence between the simple games.

OPTIMAL MIXING STRATEGIES

Harmer and Abbott [2] have experimentally studied a parameter for the probability of

playing the simple games in a Parrondo game, in order to maximize the capital of the player.

The optimal state-independent strategy u∗ is found by maximizing hg∗

t i over u ∈ [0, 1], which
is the quotient of two ﬁfth-degree polynomials. For ǫ = 1/1000, u∗ ≈ 0.2906. In a similar

manner, the optimal state-dependent strategies can be calculated by deﬁning hg∗

t i as a

function of the conditional probabilities p∗

i|jk···.

PARRONDO’S ORIGINAL GAME HAS POSITIVE EXPECTED VALUE

In Parrondo’s original game (see [4]), the positive game outcome again depends on the

tacit game interaction with a state parameter, in this case the accumulated capital. The

game outcome at time t is gt ∈ {−1, 1}. The winning probabilities depend on the accumu-

lated capital Ct = Ct−1 + gt−1. The conditional transition probabilities are given by

p1|;0 =

P +

p1|;1 = p1|;2 =

P = 1/2 − ǫ,

P1 = 1/10 − ǫ,

P2 = 3/4 − ǫ

where we use the notation

pt
ijk··· ;l = P rob[gt = i, gt−1 = j, gt−2 = k, · · · , Ct ≡ l (mod M)]

and skip the t for the ergodic transition probabilites, and denote conditional probability

pi···|j··· = pi···/pj···. Hence, p1|;0 is the probability of winning when the capital C ≡ 0 (mod M).

For M = 3 we observe that

p;0 = p−1;1 + p1;2

p;1 = p−1;2 + p1;0

p;2 = p−1;0 + p1;1

and since

pi;j = pi|;jp;j

we can solve for the unknown p;i in the linear system (7), (8), (9), and (10) which for

ǫ = 1/1000 has the solution

p;0 =

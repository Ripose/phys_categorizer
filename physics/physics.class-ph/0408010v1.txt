An analysis of the big-bang theory according to classical physics

R. Alvargonz´alez and L. S. Soto
Facultad de F´ısica, Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain
(Dated: February 2, 2008)

This paper collects a consistent body of information on the observable Universe, from which an
estimate of the total mass of the Universe is calculated as a function of the angle whose vertex is
at the center of the Universe, and whose extremities stand on the Earth and on the limits of the
horizon of visibility. This result leads to an analysis of the dynamics of the Big-Bang, taking into
account the limitations imposed by the Schwarzschild radius, RS. Where if R0 is the radius of the
incipient Universe when the formation of elementary particles has just ﬁnished, the value of the
quotient R0/RS determines its subsequent evolution. An important conclusion from this concerns
the expansion of the Universe; all signs point to its being destined to expand indeﬁnitely.

I. PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS

This paper uses the (e, me, c) system of units in which
the basic nits are the quantum of electric charge, electron
mass and the speed of light.

According to the theory of the Big-Bang, the history of
the Universe begins with an unimaginably great outburst
of photons of very high energy around a point ω, after
which time begins to elapse. The formation of heavy
particles at once begins, and ends when the temperature
of the Universe has fallen to below the required level, and
the radius of the Universe has attained the dimension
R = R0.

FIG. 1:

The dynamics of the Big-Bang thus appears to be the
result of the joint action of the kinetic energies of the par-
ticles which emerge at a velocity close to c at a distance
Rx from ω, and the attraction of the mass of the Universe
M0, which is exerted from ω, the center of its mass, rea-
sonably assuming a uniform expansion, causing matter to
be distributed as spherical surfaces of radius R. Figure 1
shows a diametric section on which Point A indicates our
observatory on Earth, Point B represents the limit of the
visibility from A, so that the velocity of growth of AB
is c, and Point ω is the centre of the Universe, perhaps
the starting point of the Big-Bang, perhaps the center of
what was emerged from the Big-Bang.

The relation between the volume of the observable Uni-
verse, Vϕ, and that of the totality of the Universe, V0, is
given by the relation between the area of the sphere and
the spherical segment BAB′. In other words:

V0

This relation holds for ϕ

Just after the Big-Bang, the radius of the Universe
was growing at speed c. As the speed of the growth of R
decreased, the value of ϕ must have gone on increasing,
so that the speed at which B moves away from A would
continue to be c.

II. CALCULATION OF THE MASS OF THE
UNIVERSE

The information used in this paper comes mostly from
the third edition of “Universe”, published in 2000. This
book contains (Fig. 26-22) a sky map which is said to
show approximately 10 % of the visible Universe, and
which has permitted an estimate to be made of the num-
106 galaxies have thus been
ber of galaxies. Roughly 2
×
detected. We can therefore guess that the number of
galaxies in the observable Universe could be of the order
of 2

107, though this is only a preliminary estimate.

Also these galaxies are distributed as follows:

1011M⊙.

77 % spiral galaxies (S) and (SB) of between 109
and 4
×
20 % elliptical galaxies (E) of between 105 and
1013M⊙.
3% irregular galaxies (Irr) of between 107 and
109M⊙.

×
Where M⊙ is the mass of the Sun (Universe, p.
646).

×

•

•

•

It is estimated that dispersed interstellar matter (el-
ementary particles, atoms, molecules and “dust”) is in-
signiﬁcant in elliptical galaxies and represents between
2.5% and 25% of the mass of stars and planets in the
spiral and irregular galaxies.

Keeping in mind the fact that the immense majority
of elliptical galaxies are dwarfs and that the giant ellip-
tical galaxies are rare, an estimate has been made of the
average mass of the group, assuming that the probabil-
ity distribution of the logarithms of their masses follows
a Poisson distribution. This produces an average mass
of 107M⊙ (any future more exact study would start from
the statistical analysis of the available data –not too awk-
ward a task).

For galaxies (S) and (Irr) a normal distribution has
106 galaxies

been assumed, with the result that for 20
in question, we obtain this preliminary estimate:

×

Spirals

3.550855

×
1013M⊙

Ellipticals 4

×

Irregular 3.48

1014M⊙

×
3.551243

1018M⊙

×

It may seen absurd to go as far as 7 signiﬁcant ﬁg-
ures in a preliminary approximation to the mass of spiral
galaxies, this has been done in order to highlight the
great preponderance of these galaxies within the present
estimate.

To this sum, 3.5512

1018M⊙, we must add the in-
tergalactic “dark matter”, scattered through the heart of
the clouds of galaxies, and whose mass is thought to be of
the same order of magnitude as that of the galaxies in the
clouds (Universe, p´ag. 659). That would mean that this
ﬁgure should be doubled, giving the preliminary result:

where Mϕ is the mass of the “visible Universe”, ϕ is
the angle [AωB between the Earth, ω (origin of the Big-
Bang) and B, which is the must distant observed ob-
ject and shows a redshift z = 5.34 (Universe, p. 597);

The fact that there exists a “limit of visibility” which is
moving away at the speed of ligth shows that the Universe
is expanding. Returning to Fig. 1, and remembering that
the length of the arc AB is equal to R

and that of the observable Universe as estimated above.
This is not the place for deep discussion about the
nature of space in our Universe; the simplest hypotheses
are that is either a three-dimensional Euclidean space, or
a three-dimensional spherical surface. Against the ﬁrst of
these hypotheses, it can be argued that if it were true, the
lines of sight taken along ωA would imply distances to the
“frontier of the Universe”, which are much shorter than
the lines of sight taken at right angles with ωA (see Fig.
2). This has not been observed, and would be not the
case if the second hypothesis were true. According to the
second hypothesis the light would move along geodesics
within the three-dimensional surface x2 + y2 + z2 + u2 =
R2, which are great circles of radius R, and since we are
living inside it, we would not be in a situation where we
could observe any 4th dimension, just as the imaginary
“ﬂatlanders” living on the two-dimensional surface x2 +
y2 + z2 = R2 could not perceive the existence of a 3rd
dimension.

of the Hubble constant, HU , lies between 60 and 90 km/s.

distance to the horizon of visibility would be 1.629
light years, which would thus be the length of the arc
AB in Fig. 1. For a value of HU = 27.6 km/s. per
106 light years, the length of the same arc would be only
1010 light years. Table II shows the lengths of

of visibility, turn out our telescope in the diametrically
opposite direction and obtain a closer view, but in the
other side of that cosmic object. We must study this
possibility by analysis of the information available from
cosmic cartography. Figure 3 illustrates this possibility,

III. DYNAMICS OF THE LAST PARTICLE OF
MASS me TO EMERGE FROM THE BIG-BANG
AT A DISTANCE R0 FROM ω

Using the (e, me, c) system, the mass of the Universe
is given by M0me and the numerical coeﬃcient of the
10−43. When the last
gravitational constant is Ge = 2.4
particle of matter was formed as a result of the processes
following the Big-Bang, the formation of pairs of greater
mass had ended relatively long ago. The ﬁnal addition
to the mass derived from the said processes must have
been a pair e−; e+. This electron of mass me, formed at
a distance R0 from the center of mass of the Universe,

×

ω, and moving away from it at a speed very close to c,
must have had a kinetic energy in (R0, t0) very close to
1
mec2, being t0 the time elapsed between the Big-Bang
2
and the formation of that ﬁnal pair. After a period t
had elapse since t0, its distance from ω must have been
R0 + Rt, its velocity vt < c, and its kinetic energy Et =
1
mec2, since the particle in question was at
2
all times subjected to the attraction of the mass of the
Universe, M0me, situated at a distance R0 +Rt = R from
it. We are trying to determine:

The evolution of the velocity of the particle, vt, as

its velocity decreases, because the particle of mass me is
subjected to the attraction of the mass M0me, which is

the force

When considering these equations we must remember
RS/R0 = a2 requires that
that the equivalence RS/(1
R0. This means that we must discard those solu-
RS ≤
tions where R0 < RS. As we have seen in the preceding
analysis, these solutions are those which imply that R in-
creases up to a limit Rmax, after which it would decrease,
thus returning the Universe towards ω. In other words,
(8), (9) and (10) imply the negation of the Big Crunch.
This should not be seen as a binding proof; it derives
from the change of variables required to solve an inte-
gral. However, the fact that if the contrary case is true,
its solution leads to imaginary values is surely a strong
argument against that.

Equations (9) and (10) show that the function R(t)
depends only on the quotient R0/RS. We must remem-
ber that R0 is the length of R when the last pair e−; e+
was formed following the Big-Bang, and that RS is the
Schwarzschild radius for the mass of the Universe.

Therefore we have a parabolic branch parallel to R =

We must now consider the measurement R0 of the ra-

formation of matter. The Big-Bang might either have
happened exactly at the point ω, or have burst out as
a “sphere of light” of radius Rx, without this making
any diﬀerence to the eventual evolution of the Universe.
What is really important is that the speed of formation
of the matter existing after the elapse of t since the hap-
pening of the Big-Bang is such that Rt = Rx + c

From what immediately follows this lines from Uni-
verse, it can be inferred that the current hypotheses on
the evolution of the Universe includes the supposition
that the formation of matter was completed before 2 sec-
onds has passed since the start of time, which implies
that the Big-Bang happened as a sudden outburst of a
106 light
“sphere of light”, of radius greater that 2.216
years.

Let R0 be the radius of the Universe at the completion
of formation of matter in t = t0, and R1 and R2 the
distances to ω of 2 particles which were formed during
t < t0. If the order of magnitude of t0 is 2s. = 2.127742
×
1023te and that of R0 is greater than 7.439663
1036le,
the values of R1 and R2 would be expressed for the whole
radius ωR0 in very huge numbers, while the time elapsed
between t = 0 and t = t0 will also produce huge ﬁgures
for the practical whole of that time.

for which value the “mass of Schwarzschild” would be
1065me. A greater speed of transformation
2.216398
into matter of photons of very high energy, would result
in the formation of a black hole. Therefore, the process

This value is a very strich bottom limit, since we
must suppose that the speed of matter formation de-
creases as the density of energy decreases, together with
the increase in the radius of the Universe and the dis-
appearance of the photons of very high energy, which
had already been consumed during the previous forma-
tion of matter. This limit obviously corresponds to the
Schwarzschild radius for 1.55

As for the second alternative, in which the Big-Bang
starts with the sudden outburst of a “sphere of light” of
radius Rx, the radius of the Universe at the moment of
completion of matter formation, would still be greater
106 light years, but the time-lapse needed

“Thus, as soon as the temperature of the
1013K 0,
radiation ﬁeld falls below 1.09
photon-antiproton pairs can no longer be cre-
ated. Each kind of particle has its own
threshold temperature. For example, elec-
trons and positrons have masses 2000 times
smaller than protons and antiprotons. Thus
the threshold temperature for the creation of
electron-positron pairs is about 1/2000 that
for proton-antiproton pairs. Consequently,
when the radiation temperature falls below
109K 0, the reation γ +γ = e+ +e− that
5.93
creates electron-positron pairs can no longer
take place”.

FIG. 5: Positions of (me), and (me)2 at t = t0, R = R0.

The particle (me)1 formed at distance R1 from ω in
t = t1, is only aﬀected by the attraction of those particles
whose distance from ω is less that R1. Also, the density
of the matter formed between t = 0 and t = t1 must
be uniform over the whole Universe if, as seems logical,
we suppose that the “sphere of light” which arose in the
Big-Bang had an equal density of energy in all its parts.
If so, the mass which would attract (me)1, from ω would
π(R1)3δ, and the mass which would attract

be equal to

(me)2 would be

π(R2)3δ. Thus, there corresponds to

Assuming that particle (me)1 will not “overtake” oth-

tainly have caused a far from homogeneous distribution.

of the gravitational pull of the mass of the Universe M0,
with its centre of mass in ω (supposing an expansion
in no preferred direction, i.e. as spherical surfaces with

B. Exploitation of the model

×

The evaluation of the length of AB derives from: A)
Measurements of the redshifts of the furthest cosmic ob-
jects. B) Evaluations of HU , through the observation
of redshifts and other characteristics of many cosmic ob-
jects. These measurements and evaluations lead to values
of HU between 60 and 90 km/Mpsc.s. Finally, the value
of Mϕ has been obtained from a preliminary evaluation
which must be improved.

The relation tU =

of the age of the Universe the uncertainty implicit in the
1010 years <
evaluation of HU , which means that 1.096
tU < 1.626

1010 years.

×

It is reasonable to suppose that 1 < ϕ < π radians,
and for each value of ϕ we have a value of R given by
R = tU /ϕ, because the measure of AB in light years is
the same as the measure of tU in years. After recalling all
these facts, we can use equations (12) and (16) to obtain
sets of coherent values of R, RS, R0, dR/dt, ϕ and dϕ/dt
for diﬀerent values of both these unrelated magnitudes
HU and ϕ, whose ﬁelds of variation we have just settled
within relatively strict limits. For each pair of values of
HU and R0/RS, there is only one value of RU that satis-
ﬁes (12), but the values of ϕ; RS; R0 and dR/dt depend
only on R0/RS and on M0. Present conditions depend
on what was the value of R0/RS when the Universe was
born. We must state here that RU is the radius which
sets the boundaries for the Universe of matter, subject
to the attraction of M0 placed in ω. Beyond R0, we must
c, whose measurement in light years
consider RL = tU ·
is the same as tU in years and which corresponds to the
distance travelled, since the Big-Bang by the light not
transformed in matter.

As it can be seen in Tables IV and V, the very low
values of R0/RS always correspond to ϕ
π, and the
high values of this quotient correspond to ϕ tending to
1 radian. No value is given for ϕ > π radians. The
value R0/RS = 1.00 correspond to ϕ
, which is
inadmissible.

Knowing these three points and the values of dR/dt in
each one of them we can easily draw the path of R which
can be seen on Fig. 7. The only problem is, that after
reaching point P3 our particle (me) would go on towards
ω at velocities greater than c. But (me) would be then
subject to black hole conditions, and its behaviour might
be diﬀerent.

The representation of (10) is that of R as function of

belong to the representation of (10) when 1

any other value of t, the equation (10) gives imaginary
values of R. But the fact that we can calculate easily
the coordinates and the values of dR/dt for points P1,
P2 and P3 (see Fig. 7) leads us to believe that there
would be a real representation of R as function of t when

know something about the possible implications of this,
and it is possible to get some useful knowledge without

The present value of RU , given by RU = tU /ϕ, can be
seen in Table IV to be more than 1000 times the radius
of Schwarzschild which corresponds to ϕ = 1 radian in

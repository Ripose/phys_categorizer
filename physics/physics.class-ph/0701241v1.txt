Abstract Explicit solutions of the two-dimensional ﬂoating body problem
2 and of the
(bodies that can ﬂoat in all positions) for relative density ρ
tire track problem (tire tracks of a bicycle, which do not allow to determine,
which way the bicycle went) are given, which diﬀer from circles. Starting point
is the diﬀerential equation given by the author in [8, 9].

1 Introduction

This paper considers the two-dimensional version of the ﬂoating body problem
asked by Stanislaw Ulam in the Scottish Book[4] (problem 19): Is a sphere the
only solid of uniform density which will ﬂoat in water in any position? It also
deals with the tire track problem, which asks whether it is possible, to have tire
tracks of the front and the rear wheel, which do not allow to determine which
way the bicycle went.

Tis paper is an improved and extended version of the solution given in [10].
It is extended insofar as ﬁgures for several curves are given. The discussion of
the tire track problem is extended and explicit results for the cross-sections are
given. Moreover the solution is formulated in terms of the four extreme radii,
which makes the solution and symmetries more transparent.

A large class of the two-dimensional cross-sections diﬀerent from the circle
2 by Auerbach[2] which can ﬂoat

were found for bodies of relative density ρ = 1
in all orientations. Here the case ρ

= 1

2 is considered.

It has been shown[2], also[7, 9] that in two dimensions such a body has the
property that any chord dissecting the body in two pieces whose areas are the
fractions ρ and 1
ρ of the whole area must have the same constant length 2ℓ.
Two equivalent properties are:

(dx1)2 + ℓ2

1(dφ)2 and du2 =

1dφ = df2 = 1

(i) Consider two close-by water-lines through the cross-section, A1A2 and
B1B2. (The body is kept ﬁxed and the direction of the gravitational force is
rotated.) Put the x-axis parallel to A1A2. Then the vector A1B1 is given
by (dx1,
ℓ1dφ) and A2B2 by (dx2, ℓ2dφ). Constant length dℓ = 0 implies
dx2 = dx1. Constant areas implies df1 = 1
2dφ. Thus
ℓ1 = ℓ2 = ℓ. This implies, that the inﬁnitesimal arcs at the perimeter du1 =
(dx2)2 + ℓ2
2(dφ)2 are equal. Thus the part of
the perimeter below the water-line is constant. Oﬀ course the same is also true
p
for the part above the water-line. One can conclude the other way round: If a
curve has the property that if one moves from two ﬁxed points A1 and A2 by
constant arcs u along the perimeter and the length of the chord remains ﬁxed,
then also the areas separated by the chord stay constant. One argues that since
ℓ stays constant one has dx1 = dx2. Since du1 = du2 also ℓ1 = ℓ2 and thus
df1 = df2. In the main part of the paper this property will be used. By measur-
ing the distance along the arc from a ﬁxed point of the boundary one introduces
the arc parameter u. It will be shown that for certain diﬀerences 2 δu of the
arc parameter the length of the chord is constant, that is the distance between
the point at arc parameter u

δu and at arc parameter u + δu is constant.

(ii) Another interesting property is that since ℓ1 = ℓ2, one has dy1 =

dy2,
which implies that the angles δ between the tangents and the chord are equal,
δ1 = δ2.

−

The ﬂoating body problem is related to the tire track problem ([6] and papers
cited therein). Denote the boundary of the body by Γ and the envelope of the
waterlines, which consists of the midpoints of the chords, by γ. Let the distance
between the front and the rear wheel of a bicycle be ℓ. Then if the front wheel
moves along the curve Γ and the rear wheel started on γ, then it will stay on
γ. (It is assumed that the steerer tube is always in a perpendicular position.)
Since however any tangent through a point on γ meets Γ in the two ends of
the chord, the bicycle can move both ways on the same tracks. The tire track
problem consists in ﬁnding such curves Γ, γ diﬀerent from circles, which thus
do not allow to determine which way the bicycle went. It is equivalent to the
two-dimensional ﬂoating body problem with the exception that the tire tracks
need not close or may wind several times around some point.

In [8, 9] the author suggested that one obtains a solution for the boundary

of the ﬂoating body from the diﬀerential equation

1
√r2 + r′2

= ar2 + b + cr−2,

(1)

where r′ = dr/dψ, with polar coordinates (r, ψ), provided the resulting curve
is suﬃciently convex and closed. Indeed there are such solutions. For the tire

2

track problem the restrictions are less rigorous. But among them there are
solutions, which require artistic mastery of the bicyclist, since he/she has to
move back and forth. In more diﬃcult cases the bicycle has to allow the steerer
to be rotated by more than 1800 degrees.

−

By choosing an appropriate condition for the constants a, b, and c the curves
will be closed. They show dihedral Dp symmetry. These curves have the remark-
able property that they solve the ﬂotation problem for p
2 diﬀerent densities,
which implies that there are [ p−1
2 ] diﬀerent chord lengths. (If the boundary is
the solution for relative density ρ of the body, then it is also solution for density
1
ρ with the same chord length.) These curves show an even more general
property: Consider two copies of these curves (not necessarily closed). Choose
an arbitrary point on each curve. Then there exists always an angle by which
the two curves can be rotated against each other, so that the length of the chord
between the points on the two curves stays constant, if one moves from the given
points on both curves by the same arc distance. This remarkable property made
it possible to obtain the above-mentioned diﬀerential equation by choosing the
two points inﬁnitesimally close.

−

In [8, 9] I assumed to have proven that the solutions have this property,
but Serge Tabachnikov kindly informed me that this was not correct. What I
had shown, was that if for some chord the angles δ between the chord and the
= r2 that then also the derivative
tangents on the curve obey δ1 = δ2 at r1 6
vanishes. This is a necessary condition, but it is not suﬃcient. That
it is not suﬃcient, can easily be seen, since from this argument one cannot
u2. Therefore here the diﬀerential equation will be
exclude that δ1 −
solved explicitly as a function of the arc parameter u, and it will be shown that
the curve has the desired property.

δ2 ∝

The outline of the paper is as follows: In sect. 2 an appropriate parametriza-
tion is introduced. Depending on the parameters one may have no or one or
two (real) branches. Two branches means that the curves are not congruent.
In sect. 3 the radius r as a function of the arc parameter u is determined. It
is given in terms of Weierstrass ℘-functions. The invariants g2 and g3 are real.
In the case of one branch the discrimant is negative, otherwise positive. This is
discussed in sect. 4. In the following section the polar angle and thus the whole
curve is determined as function of u. Starting from the diﬀerential equation (1)
the solution can be written

z(u) := x + iy = Ceiχ σ(u

3v)
−
σ(u + v)

e2ζ(2v)u,

(2)

where u is the (real) arc parameter. The purely imaginary v and the real
invariants g2 and g3 of the Weierstrass integrals ζ and σ, and the constant C
depend on the coeﬃcients a, b, and c. χ is an arbitrary angle which deﬁnes the
orientation of the curve around the origin and can be chosen arbitrarily.

Instead of solving (1) one could immediately start with the curve deﬁned by
(2) and ﬁrst show that the arc-parameter u indeed measures the distance along
the curve, which is done in subsect. 5.3.

3

Secondly one shows the above mentioned property in sect. 6: Given a dif-
ference δu , there exists a diﬀerence of angles, by which two copies of the curve
described by z and ˆz have to be rotated against each other, so that the distance
2ℓ =
does not depend on u (eq. 135). For vanishing dif-
ference of the angles one obtains the desired property of constant chord length
for ﬂoating bodies and tire tracks. The property of constant chords length holds
even between the two diﬀerent branches in the case of positive discriminant. In
the same section also the area above and below the waterline is determined.

In the following section the periodicity of the curves is discussed and ﬁgures
of several curves are shown. The limit case, where the discriminant vanishes is
considered in section 8. In this case the curves can be expressed in terms of
trigonometric and exponential functions. Moreover there is a simple construc-
tion principle of these curves explained in subsection 8.4. Another interesting
case is the limit, where the curve oscillates around a straight line. (This does
not constitute a solutions of the ﬂoating body problem, but of the tire-track
problem.) There one ﬁnds an inﬁnite set of δu s, for which the length of the
chord between the points of arc parameter u
δu and u + δu is independent
of u. This is considered in section 9. Bracho, Montejano and Oliveros [5, 3]
considered a special class of curves with the property of constant chord length.
The solution given here allows to reconstruct these curves. Some of them will
be shown and discussed.

−

I cannot claim that the solutions given here are the only solutions to this
problem, but I am not aware of any other solutions. There remains the question
whether starting from the known solutions small deformations can yield new
solutions similarly as a class of solutions were found from deforming the circle
[7, 9].

2 Basic Equations

2.1 A ﬁrst discussion

The curves described by the diﬀerential equation (1) will now be considered quite
generally. For this purpose the angle φ is introduced indicating the direction of
the tangent to the curve with respect to the radial vector by

dr
dψ

= r tan φ

as shown in ﬁg. 2. Then eq. (1) can be written

aq2 + bq + c = √q cos φ,

where the square q = r2 of the radius is introduced. Thus the curves obey

Depending on the constants a, b, and c the inequality (5) allows for zero, one
or two curves. This can be seen by plotting the parabola
√q and
showing aq2 + bq + c versus q. To the extend segments of the
the parabola
one obtains curves. These segments are

to a circle. Fig. 3c allows for some variation of the radius. It yields a curve
oscillating between the two extreme radii. In ﬁg. 3d the parabola
touches the
q-axis. Thus the curve shows a tangent in radial direction. In ﬁg. 3e the curve
goes backward in ψ-direction close to the smallest radius. Fig. 3f allows for a
small circle plus a curve. Fig. 3g is the limit case where the curve approaches
asymptotically the circle. Fig. 3h allows for two curves both of which approach
asymptotically a common circle one from outside, the other from inside. Fig.
3i is the generic case of two curves.

In the following a is assumed to be positive. Reversing simultaneously the signs
of a, b, and c corresponds to reversing all ri, which yields the same curves, but
a diﬀerent orientation. If a = 0, b

Multiplication of all ri by the same factor yields similar curves, but no new
i ri = 0, only two parameters are
shape. Since the four ri obey the restriction
left, which determine the shape of the curves. Thus the parametrization

is introduced, where r0 sets the scale of the curve, whereas ǫ and ˆǫ determine
its shape. ǫ and ˆǫ can always be chosen either real or purely imaginary. A sign
change of ǫ and/or ˆǫ corresponds to a permutation of the ri. Therefore the ǫ2, ˆǫ2
plane is plotted in ﬁgure 4. Both ǫ2 and ˆǫ2 are real. r0 is assumed to be real.

Consider the four quadrants in ﬁg. (4). ǫ is real and ˆǫ =

in the left upper quadrant A. Here one has one real curve. In the right upper
quadrant B both ǫ and ˆǫ are real. There one obtains two branches.
In the
right lower quadrant C ǫ is real and ˆǫ is imaginary. By exchanging ǫ and ˆǫ one
comes back to quadrant A. Finally in the lower left quadrant D both ǫ and ˆǫ
are imaginary. This does not correspond to any real curve. Thus it is suﬃcient
to consider the quadrants A and B.

six regions. If one allows an arbitrary assignment of the ri to r0(1

r0(

of ǫ and ˆǫ are plotted this reduces to six sets of (ǫ2, ˆǫ2) which are represented
by the six regions B1 to B6.

4 Single Branches and Pairs of Branches

In the preceding section the radius square q has been obtained as a function
of the arc parameter u in eq.(28). At u = 0 the function ℘(u) diverges and q
approaches q4 = r2

p1) = q3 along the curve. Then
approaches its minimum q = q4(e3 −
q increases until at u = 2ω3 it returns to q = q4. Instead starting at u = 0 with
q = q4 one can start at u = ω3 with q = q3. Therefore consider

If two of the ri are complex and two are real, then one (real) curve is obtained.

so that as in the case of one curve eq. (72) and the upper signs in eqs. (39,

There are the special cases where two of the radii ri coincide.

In these
cases the discriminant vanishes. In ﬁg. 3f one has r1 = r2. This case yields a
small circle plus a curve with varying distance from the origin. In this case the
imaginary period goes to inﬁnity. In ﬁg. 3h, where r2 = r3 there are two curves
asymptotically approaching the same circle. There the real period approaches
inﬁnity. The limit case is shown in ﬁg. 3g, where r1 = r2 = r3. In this case
both periods approach inﬁnity. These limit cases are considered in section 8.

Changing simultaneously the sign of u and v does not change z,

z(u,

v) = z(

u, v).

−

−

(104)

Thus changing the sign of v is equivalent to changing the orientation of mea-
suring the arc-parameter.

Taking the complex conjugate of z yields

(e−iχz(u, v))∗ = e−iχz(u,

v) = e−iχz(

u, v).

(105)

−

−

Thus the curve has a mirror axis which runs through the origin and eiχ.

By means of eqs. (310, 311) one ﬁnds that adding a period 2ω to v does not

alter z,

One obtains

z(u, v + 2ω) = z(u, v).

eiψ(u+2ω3) = eiψ(u)eiψper ,

eiψper = e−8vζ(ω3)+4ω3ζ(2v)

Thus the curve is periodic under rotations by ψper. This equation determines
the angle ψper only modulo 2π. Deﬁne

ψc := 4π + 8viζ(ω3)

4iω3ζ(2v).

−

Then eiψper = eiψc. In sect. 7 it will be shown that this angle equals ψper in the
region A’ of ﬁg. 4. There it will be discussed, how ψper and ψc are related in
the other regions.

Adding a half period to v yields

eiψper(v+ω) = eiψper(v)e−8iωζ(ω3)+8iω3ζ(ω) = eiψper(v),

(110)

where use has been made of the Legendre-relation (315). Thus two curves with
v diﬀering by a half-period have the same eiψper .

5.3 More on the curve

mediately start with the expression

z = x + iy = C

and demonstrate that it is solution to the problem by ﬁrst showing that u is
really the arc parameter provided one has the appropriate relations between v,

so that the distance

will be shown that (112) is fulﬁlled with appropriate choices of v′, c0, and C for

and ˆχ. Since u and δu are real, they are left unchanged upon determining the

The expression (2ℓ)2 becomes an analytic function in u and δu . Choosing

ˆv = v + νω1

(132)

allows not only to consider chords between copies of one and the same curve
(even ν), but also to connect two curves of diﬀerent branches (odd ν).

Similar to eq. (108) addition of 2ω to the argument of u multiplies both
z and ˆz by the same factor e8vζ(ω)−4ωζ(2v) and divides both z∗ and ˆz∗ by this
factor. Thus 4ℓ2 is a periodic function in u.

Apparently z∗(u + δu ) has a pole at u = v

6.2 Length of the chord

Next a simple expression for the length of the chord is derived assuming that δu
has been determined. Since 4ℓ2 is independent of u, one considers the expression
in the vicinity of diverging z∗(u + δu ), that is around u =
δu + v. There the
residuum is given by

res = Ce−iχσ(4v)e−2vζ(2v).

7.2 Periodicity

In eq. (109) an angle of periodicity ψc has been deﬁned. Here the periodicity
is discussed for all regions in ﬁg. 4. The angle of periodicity ψper is deﬁned
as the change of the angle ψ, as one moves from a point of extremal radius ri
along the curve until a point of this extremal radius is reached again. Its sign

28

is deﬁned by the requirement that watching from the origin one starts moving
counterclockwise. This yields

Since due to eqs. (22, 7)

as u is increased by 2ω3. As shown in (312, 313) this depends on the imaginary
part of the argument of the functions σ. Thus in addition to

∆ψ0 = 8viζ(ω3)

4iω3ζ(2v)

−

one obtains extra multiple of 2π. In region A′ one obtains 3π from σ(u
3v) and
π from σ(u + v). This changes as one crosses to A′′, since there

This can be seen from the sign change of ℘′(3v), eq. (50) due to the sign change
of ri. One observes, that now the curve passes at its minimum radius on the
other side of the origin. In the following table the ranges of v are listed in the

8.4 Elementary construction

The circle

ˆz = r0e−iu/r0

is a second solution for ǫ > 2. For ǫ
for u
between this circle and the curves given above is

2 this circle is approached asymptotically
. In all three cases the distance of the chord of constant length

→ ±∞

≤

2ℓ = ǫr0.

This property allows an interesting construction of the curves Γ. Consider
a straight lines (indicated in the ﬁgures by cyan and green) of length 2ℓ = r0ǫ.
One end of it moves along the (magenta) circle of radius r0 in ﬁgs. 88 to 90.
The middle point of this line moves always in direction of the line itself, as if
it were carried by a wheel aligned in the direction of the line. Then the other
end-point moves along the curve Γ.

If ǫ < 2 then there are two such curves (black and blue) one outside and one
inside the circle. Both approach asymptotically the circle for u
2
then there is only one curve, which for ǫ = 2 still approaches asymptotically
r0 decays
the circle with r
exponentially with u. For ǫ > 2 there is only one curve, which oscillates between
radii r4 and r3, which allows for periodically closed curves. Examples for ǫ > 2
are shown in ﬁgs. 79 to 83, for ǫ < 2 in ﬁgs. 88 and 89 and for ǫ = 2 in ﬁg. 90.

9 Linear Case

In this section the limit is considered, in which r0 tends to inﬁnity, but the
diﬀerences between the radii ri is kept ﬁnite. In subtracting this average radius
by taking the limit

lim

one obtains curves, which repeat under translation in y-direction. Therefore
this is called the linear case. One can distinguish three cases.

The length of a chord of constant length between two diﬀerent curves has
a lower bound d + ˆd, but no upper bound. Indeed one obtains an inﬁnity of
solutions. A pair of curves is shown in ﬁgs. 94 to 97 with three diﬀerent lengths
of the chord.

The examples of ﬁgs. 102 to 105 show curves along which a bicyclist could

tire.

10 The Carousel by Montejano, Oliveros and

Bracho

Oliveros, Montejano and Bracho[5, 3] have considered special cases of these
curves. They consider a carousel, which is a dynamical equilateral (not equian-
gular) polygon in which the midpoint of each edge travels parallel to it. Then
the trace of the vertices constitute the curves Γ whereas the midpoints outline
the envelopes γ. They perform explicitly calculations for pentagons. In general
they allow for ﬁve diﬀerent curves for the vertices.

Denoting the curves by indices j one obtains solutions for the carousel from

the curves introduced here by deﬁning

zj(u) := e2jiδχz(u),

(293)

and requiring

zj(u + δu )
|

−

zj−1(u

δu )
|

−

= 2ℓ,

z5(u + 10 δu ) = z0(u).

(294)

The ﬁrst condition is fulﬁlled with e2iδχ = r.h.s. of 135. The second condition
which guarantees that the pentagon is closed yields

z5(u + 10 δu ) = e10iδχz0(u + 10 δu ) = z0(u).

(295)

54

Thus 10 δu has to be an integer multiple of 2ω3,

with integer κ. Then the condition reduces to

δu =

ω3

κ

ei(10δχ+κψper) = 1.

(296)

An example is ﬁg. 6 of ref.

[5]. Since the curves go through the origin,
one has ǫ = 1. One realizes that the curves seem to be close to those for
0.034862. One ﬁnds that
m/n =
condition (297) is fulﬁlled for ˆǫ2 =
0.025835 and apparently for two diﬀerent
κ and two diﬀerent lengths 2ℓ of the chord. This is shown in ﬁgs. 109 and 110.
It seems that the second one corresponds to ﬁg. 6 of ref. [5].

A solution for ﬁve ’Eights’ is obtained for m/n = 0/1, ǫ = 0.689454 in ﬁgs.
111 and 112. The ratio of the arc length of the outer and the inner loop of the
eights is 2/3. Fig. 8 in [5] shows the same eights (to the extend one can judge
this with the eyes), but the pentagon shown there is misleading. It should be
as in ﬁg. 112.

Fig. 111 m/n = 0/1,
ǫ = 0.689454

Fig. 112 m/n = 0/1,
ǫ = 0.689454

The corresponding carousel for the linear case is shown in ﬁg. 113 and 114.

This solution looks like that of ﬁg. 2 of [3].

other one with n = 12-fold symmetry for ǫ = 0.5727853 in ﬁgs. 117, 118 and is
to be compared with ﬁg. 1 of [3].

A.2 Double-periodic functions

Two basic theorems on double-periodic functions are

Theorem I Two elliptic functions which have the same period, the same poles,
and the same principal parts at each pole diﬀer by a constant.

Theorem II The quotient of two elliptic functions whose periods, poles, and
zeroes (and multiplicities of poles and zeroes) are the same, is a constant.
Due to this second theorem the elliptic function

is deﬁned as the periodic function with zeroes at u1, u2, ... um and poles at
v1, v2, ... vn in an elementary cell. Zeroes and poles at the origin are counted
m-fold zero at u = 0. If
separately. If n > m, then the function has an n
n < m, then the function has instead a pole of order m

ABSTRACT

Detailed analysis of the coupled Dirac-Maxwell equations and
the structure of their solutions is presented. Numerical solu-
tions of the ﬁeld equations in the case of spherical symmetry
with negligible gravitational self-interaction reveal the exis-
tence of families of solitons with electric ﬁeld dominance that
are completely determined by the observed charge and mass
of the underlying particles. A soliton is found which has the
charge and mass of the electron as well as a charge radius
of 10−23m. This is well within the present experimentally
determined upper limit of ≃ 10−18m. Properties of these

particles as well as possible extension to the work herein are
discussed.

Introduction

Through the years, a number of authors have attempted to avoid the problems inherent in the
point-particle model by focussing upon ﬁnite soliton-like structures. Fields interacting non-
linearly provide the binding without invoking any phenomenological elements. Einstein and
Rosen[1] pointed out many years ago that particles should be contained within a ﬁeld theory
and not exist as independent entities. Rosen[2] made considerable progress in implementing
such a program in a gauge-invariant manner by minimally coupling a scalar ﬁeld to the
Maxwell ﬁeld. However, the soliton solutions yielded negative masses. Later[3], neutral
quantized particle states of positive mass were found and a more complicated model invoking
up to three scalar ﬁelds coupled to the Maxwell ﬁeld was shown to be capable of modeling
the known massive leptons[4]. However, the particles were spinless and the view then was
that a subsequent quantization of the theory would induce spin.

In 1991, one of the present authors[5] suggested an alternative route to elementary particle
modelling, namely as solitons of Dirac–Maxwell theory. Since Dirac–Maxwell theory had
been so successful in describing electron spin and magnetic moment, predicting the existence
of the positron and reﬁning the energy levels in interacting systems such as hydrogen, it

seemed reasonable that this might successfully extend to a self-interacting soliton structure
to model the elementary particles themselves. Spin would already exist in such a model via
the spinor structure of the wave function. Shortly thereafter, such solitons were found and
their properties studied[6]. A few years later, Lisi[7] independently discovered some of the
results in[6]. Recently, there has been a revival of interest in this ﬁeld and in particular, the
issue of gravitational coupling in the Dirac–Maxwell system has been considered[8]. However,
there was the misconception that gravitation was a necessary ingredient for the creation of
the soliton.

In this paper, we develop the essential results in[5] and[6] and discuss the role of gravitation
in soliton structure. The experimental inputs are the respective masses of the electron, muon
and tau, their charge and as a constraint, the upper limit to their size which is ≃ 10−16 cm.
The plan of the paper is as follows: in sec. 2, we set out the essential coupled Dirac–Maxwell
equations to be solved. The structure of the Dirac wave function in spherical coordinates is
given and particularized to the case of electric ﬁeld dominance. The equation is separated
in sec. 3 and we contrast the standard treatment in which a potential function is imposed
such as in the case of hydrogen and the present case of the soliton where the derivation of
the potential is part of the problem. The formal structure of the potential in terms of the
Green’s function is given. It is shown that there do exist spherically symmetric potentials for
appropriate choices of quantum numbers.

In sec. 4, the spherically symmetric energy-momentum tensor is derived. The relationship
between the parameters in the Dirac equation and the physically measured quantities is
discussed and the expression for the spatial spread of the soliton is given. The various
constraints including singularity avoidance lead to the required boundary conditions for the
problem.

In sec. 5, the results are presented. New variables of convenience for numerical integration
are introduced. The parameters leading to twenty ground state solitons are listed. It is found
that there is a critical range which leads to solitons within the experimentally observed upper
limit to the size of the electron. Excited states are presented and the mass ratios are found.
In the ﬁnal section 6, the essential achievements as well as the limitations of the results
are discussed.
It is stressed that the solitons have been found without the requirement
of signiﬁcant gravitational interaction and it is conjectured that gravity will be signiﬁcant
In cgs units,
for Dirac–Maxwell solitons when e/m ≃ 1 in units for which G = c = 1.
this is 2.58 × 10−4 esugm−1. By contrast, the e/m ratio for the electron is 2.04 × 1021 or
5.27 × 1017 esugm−1 in cgs units.

2 Derivation of the Equations

The ﬁeld equations are obtained from the Lagrangian of quantum electrodynamics[9]

L = i¯hc ¯ψγµ∂µψ − mc2 ¯ψψ −

F µνFµν − e ¯ψγµψAµ
where ψ = (ψ1, ψ2, ψ3, ψ4)T is the Dirac spinor, ¯ψ = ψ†γ0 = (ψ∗
4), Aµ = (ϕ, A)
2,−ψ∗
is the electromagnetic four-vector potential and F µν = ∂µAν − ∂ν Aµ is the Maxwell tensor.
The γµ are 4 × 4 Hermitian anticommuting matrices of the unit square

σ1 =   0 1

Variation with respect to Aµ and ¯ψ respectively, yield the ﬁeld equations

F µν

,ν = −4π ¯ψγµψ

i¯hcγµ∂µψ − mc2ψ − eγµψAµ = 0.

(3)

If ψ is chosen to be an energy eigenstate with energy E and one chooses a static charge
distribution with a four-vector potential of the form

then the equations (2)-(3) are reduced to

Aµ = (cid:16)φ(r, θ, ϕ), Ak(r, θ, ϕ)(cid:17) ,

k = 1, 2, 3

h−i¯hcα · ∇ + α4mc2 − eα · A + eφ − Ei ψ = 0

∇ × (∇ × A) = 4πeψ†αψ

where αk = γ0γk.

In spherical coordinates, (x, y, z) = (r sin θ cos ϕ, r sin θ sin ϕ, r cos θ), the Dirac wave func-

tion has the structure[10]

In addition, m is an integer such that −j ≤ m + 1/2 ≤ j; (m + 1/2)¯h is the z-component of
the total angular momentum.
Consider the spinor with j = 1/2, l = 0 and m = 0 which implies from the above

representation (7)

4πψ†ψ = f (r)2 + g(r)2
4πψ†αψ = 2f (r)g(r) sin θ(− sin ϕ, cos ϕ, 0)T.

Resolving equations (5) and (6) into spherical coordinates gives

∇2φ = −e(cid:16)f (r)2 + g(r)2(cid:17)

Aµ = (φ(r),−Aϕ(r, θ) sin ϕ, Aϕ(r, θ) cos ϕ, 0)

= 2ef (r)g(r) sin θ.

Therefore, a four-vector potential of the form

should be chosen where the components satisfy

(9)

(10)

Since the right hand side of equation (10) is nonzero, the theory can only be exact if Aϕ is
nonzero. However at this point we will impose the assumption of electric ﬁeld dominance
and hence the dominance of φ over A or f (r) dominance over g(r).

For the validity of the approximation A = 0, one radial component of the spinor must

dominate over the other so that

It will be demonstrated that such objects do exist within the non-linear ﬁeld. With this ap-
proximation the equations to solve reduce to a Dirac equation coupled to a Poisson equation:

f g ≪ f 2 + g2.

h−i¯hα · ∇ + α4mc2 + V (r)i ψ = Eψ

4

(11)

∇2V = −4πe2ψ†ψ.

(12)

With these facts in mind, we now turn to the separation of the stationary Dirac equa-
tion (11) with respect to a general central potential and the derivation of the form of ψ†ψ
for a general set of quantum numbers.

3 Separation of the Equation

The separation procedure follows that given in Bethe and Salpeter[10]. First one introduces
quantum numbers l and j; l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number as well as
being an integer ≥ 0; j is the total angular momentum quantum number and can assume
just the two values l + 1/2 and l − 1/2, (but only +1/2 for l = 0). The forms assumed by the
four components of ψ are given explicitly in (7).
The explicit form of the Dirac equation (11) for the four components of the wave function

is:

¯hchE − V (r) − mc2i ψ2 = 0
¯hchE − V (r) + mc2i ψ3 = 0
¯hchE − V (r) + mc2i ψ4 = 0.

i

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

Therefore, by inserting the assumed wave functions (7) into (13)-(16) and using identities
similar to (A.6) we ﬁnd that the following two coupled equations between f and g hold:

1

¯hc hE − V (r) + mc2i f (r) −(cid:20) dg
¯hchE − V (r) − mc2i g(r) +(cid:20) df

where the new quantum number κ is deﬁned as

κ = ( −l − 1 for

for

l

j = l + 1/2 (l = 0, 1, . . .)
j = l − 1/2 (l = 1, 2, . . .).

(17)

(18)

(19)

These equations are valid for all spherically symmetric potentials V (r) = V (r) and together
they replace expression (11).

At this point, the standard procedure is to specify an external spherically symmetric
potential, an example of which is the electrostatic potential energy of the proton-electron

5

interaction. That is, simply

V (r) = −

Ze2
r

,

which is the fundamental solution of Laplace’s equation[11]

∇2V = 4πZe2δ3(r)

(20)

where δ3(r) is a three dimensional Dirac delta function centered at the origin. This is
consistent with the far range1 behaviour that we expect to ﬁnd for the self-ﬁeld of the fermion
since, when we compare (20) with (12) we see that the fermion is treated as an object without
structure through the equality,

ψ†ψ = −δ3(r).

There is one additional problem that must be explored, namely how to couple relation
(5) to (17)-(18). This will be achieved in three parts. First, we ﬁnd the Green’s function for
the equation (5). Second, we ﬁnd an analytic form for the probability density ψ†ψ using (7).
Once this equation is known, we can proceed to the third step which is to ﬁnd V (r) by
forming the convolution of the Green’s function of step one, with the probability density of
step two.

The potential V (r) satisﬁes the Poisson equation (12) and by assuming that the solution

is suﬃciently regular, this can be converted to an integral equation[12]

V (r) = −4πe2Z G(r, r′)ψ†(r′)ψ(r′) dr′

(21)

where G(r, r′) is the Green’s function of the Laplacian operator in three dimensions

With the Green’s function determined, we can turn our attention to the probability den-
sity. This is accomplished by using a pair of identities for the associated Legendre functions2

for the case j = l − 1/2. It is to be noted that the primed indices (l′, m′) correspond to the
angular momentum of the particle, while the unprimed indices run over the complete set of
permissible angular momentum quantum numbers. By performing the angular integration
of the above formulae, one can immediately conclude that both of the above integrals vanish
except when m = 0 and l = 0, 2, . . . , 2l′. This implies that

where the cases j = l ± 1/2 have been combined by the application of the deﬁnition of κ′.
Expression (27) replaces the equation (12). When written in this form, it is clearly seen that
the potential V (r) is not in general spherically symmetric. Table 1 lists the potential (27)
for l′ = 0, 1 and illustrates the fact that there exists spherically symmetric states with l′ 6= 0.
A localized solution of this model must satisfy the ﬁeld equations (17) and (18) for f and
g and a given energy E where the potential is given by the expression (27). Moreover, it is
required that the total probability

0 (cid:16)f 2 + g2(cid:17) r2dr < ∞.

Since the equations which describe the spatial evolution of the wave function (17)-(18)
were derived under the assumption that the potential, V (r), is spherically symmetric, they
are not valid for an extended Dirac particle in an arbitrary state of angular momentum. We
have shown that there do exist certain choices of l and m where the probability density is
spherically symmetric and it is these cases in which our primary interest lies.

We can conclude that with the spinor representation given by (7), there are essentially
three diﬀerential equations to be solved simultaneously. Equations (17)-(18) specify the
spatial evolution of the wave function and equation (27) reﬂects the spatial extent of the
self-ﬁeld of the particle. A strategy for solving these intrinsically non-linear equations, as
well as a few of their interesting properties, will be explored in the following sections.

4 Boundary Conditions

From the previous section we have found that the equations to be satisﬁed for a self-interacting
fermion are equations (17)-(18) and

2l + 1 (cid:16)f 2 + g2(cid:17)(cid:20)(κ + m + 1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

∇2V = −4πe2 2(l − j)
where we have combined the j = l ± 1/2 cases by using the deﬁnition of κ. Since we have
assumed that the potential V in equations (17)-(18) is spherically symmetric, this necessarily
restricts the choice of l and m. Assume from this point on that l and m are chosen to satisfy
this criterion. Consequently, equation (28) becomes

l (θ, ϕ)|2(cid:21)

+ (κ − m)|Y m

(θ, ϕ)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Since the soliton asires as a coupling between Dirac and Maxwell ﬁelds, the energy E that
appears in the Dirac equation is not the total energy of the particle. The total energy can be
obtained by calculating the T 0
0 component of the energy-momentum tensor. For our ﬁeld, the
Lagrangian is given by equation (1) where Aµ is the vector potential of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld. One generates the symmetric energy-momentum tensor directly from the Lagrangian
in the form[14]

where dVol is an inﬁnitesimal volume element. This total energy should be associated with
the observed mass of the particle as Etot = mc2. There is still suﬃcient freedom remaining
to set limr→∞ V (r) = 0 because the spinor is invariant under the transformation

V → V + β;

E → E + β

for any real-valued β.

The mass m and the charge e that appear in the Dirac equation are not necessarily the
experimentally measured quantities just as the charge that appears at a vertex of a Feynman
graph is not the experimentally measured charge of the particle. Because of this, we will
replace the m in (17)-(18) by the symbol µ. In addition, the e in (29) will be replaced by
an ǫ. The symbols m and e will be reserved for the physically observed quantities. With
these substitutions, we convert to a set of variables whereby equations (17), (18) and (31)
are independent of any physical constants. The particular transformation chosen is

f = ηF, g = ηG, r =

¯hx
µc

, E = λµc2, V = µc2U

where η2 = µ3c4/ǫ2¯h2. These redeﬁned variables have the following dimensions in terms of
length (L):

[x] = L0;

[λ] = L0;

[F ] = L−3/2;

[G] = L−3/2;

[U ] = L0.

This yields the transformed equations:

We will show that if the charge ǫ is replaced by e, that the f component of the spinor
greatly dominates the g component. By substituting ǫ = e and choosing a value for m, the
value of µ can be determined numerically once the spatial extent of the soliton is known. In
this case, the expectation value of the radius of the particle becomes

To stay within the current experimental bounds of the mean charge radius, this value must

Since we know that U has zero slope at x = 0 and that it must behave as N/x for large
argument (N is the amount of enclosed charge), we assume as a ﬁrst approximation, that
U can be represented as the electrostatic potential produced by a sphere of radius R0 with
uniform charge density. Therefore,

With this representation, one ﬁnds that

Let R0 be deﬁned as the eﬀective range of the non-Coulombic behaviour of the potential
energy so that for x > R0, U (x) ∼ N/x. Since U is a solution to a Poisson equation with

10

a negative deﬁnite charge density, U (0) must be larger than U (R0). This can be quickly
veriﬁed by considering the opposite. If U (0) < U (R0) then there exists some r ∈ (0, R0) such
that U ′(r) = 0. Therefore integrating (34) from 0 to r, one obtains

which is clearly a contradiction.

To determine the initial values of F and G, one simply eliminates either F or G from (32-

33), say F , which leads to a second order equation for the other, namely,

G′′ + P G′ + QG = 0

where both P and Q are functions of U , U ′, κ, λ and x. To avoid a singularity in the
potential U (x), it must be both bounded and have zero slope in a neighbourhood of the
origin. Moreover, both F and G are bounded in this same neighbourhood. From this, it is
easy to verify that

Furthermore, by examining the indicial equation, it can be shown that no fractional powers
exist in a power series solution of either F or G about the origin x = 0.

Summarizing the boundary conditions:

U (x) < U (0) < ∞,

U ′(0) = 0,

x ∈ [0,∞),

together with the conditions (38), (39). For the case κ = −1, the initial values of U , G and
the energy λ are determined by the requirement that the wave function ψ, and hence both
F and G, vanish exponentially as x → ∞.

To ﬁnd a soliton, the values of F (0), G(0) are speciﬁed and a search is made for the value
of U (0) whereby limx→∞ xF (x) = 0 and limx→∞ xG(x) = 0. Only values of G(0) > 0
are considered because the equations are symmetric under the transformation G → −G,
F → −F , U → U .
In a neighbourhood of a ground state soliton, the radial probability
density is numerically seen to have a single well-deﬁned minimum value for x > 0. The
choice of κ = −1 gives the initial condition F (0) = 0.
The choice of λ = 1 is simply a numerical convenience. Outside the neighbourhood of
a soliton it is expected that the potential will behave as U (x) ∼ A + B/x for large x. The
value of λ should have been chosen so that the asymptotic behaviour of the potential U (x)
is purely Coulombic in nature. By deﬁning a shifted potential ˜U (x) = U (x) − limx→∞ U (x),
this value of λ must satisfy 1 − U (x) = λ − ˜U (x). Therefore after a soliton is found the value
of λ is given as λ = 1 − limx→∞ U (x). In addition, the starting value of ˜U (x) is given by
˜U (0) = U (0) + λ − 1.
Using the redeﬁned value of λ the observed charge and mass of the particle are compared
to the values used in the Lagrangian by using the expressions (36) and (35) respectively. By

the charge ratio ǫ/e is given as

where α is the ﬁne structure constant. The mass ratio µ/m = P 2/αE and the expectation

Both of the quantities P and X are positive. However, depending upon the value of λ, E
could be positive, negative or even zero if the electromagnetic and “bare mass” terms in the
energy exactly cancel. A negative value for E will give an unphysical negative value for the
observed radius hri. Because of this ambiguity, both the value of hri and the particle width
∆r = phr2i − hri2 are presented. Tables 2 and 3 respectively list the numerical parameters
and the observed properties of a number of ground state particles found where m was taken
to be the observed mass of the electron me.

Figure 1 illustrates the radial behaviour of F and G for the case ǫ = e (i = 1). It is to
be noted that for x > 0, F is much larger than G and as a consequence, F G ≪ F 2 + G2.
In fact, G is so small that it resembles a straight line along the x axis. This supports the
argument that the four-vector potential can be reasonably approximated with only a radial
A0 component.

12

The characteristics of a typical soliton with ǫ 6= e is illustrated with the choice ǫ/e =
454.8 (i = 19). In this case the potential plays a much more dominant role in holding the
particle together than in the case ǫ = e. However, since in this case the approximation of
F G ≪ F 2 + G2 is violated, one would have to solve the full model (equations (9)-(10)) to
properly analyse this situation. This would be a far more complicated problem. Figure 2
illustrates the radial components of this spinor and it shows that the magnitude of G is
now comparable to the magnitude of F . Table 3 also shows that the choice of ǫ = 389.0e,
µ = 2.360 × 1012me (i = 15) yields a soliton with an expectation value for the radius of
5.05 × 10−23m. This size is well within the present experimentally determined upper limit
for the electron radius of ≃ 10−18m.
These equations also exhibit excited states. The nth excited state of our ﬁeld is charac-
terized through the functions Fn(x), Gn(x) and Un(x) for which the Gn component crosses
the abscissa n + 1 times while the Fn component crosses it n times. Once the ground state
solution is found, the value of µ can be determined through equation (36). The corresponding
nth excited state is that excited state with the same observed charge ratio, ǫ/e, as the ground
state. Therefore, in this interpretation of the theory, the ratio of the mass of the nth excited
state to the ground state is given by the expression

Figure 3 shows radial probability density of the ﬁrst three states for the case G(0) = 1. Each
of these solitons has a diﬀerent value of ǫ/e.

Figure 4 illustrates the behaviour of the mass ratio, µ/m, as a function of the charge ratio
ǫ/e for the ground state and the ﬁrst two excited states. For each class of particles there is
a charge ratio where the electromagnetic and bare mass components of the energy balance
making E = 0. At this value of ǫ/e, the mass ratio µ/m → ∞. At charge ratios less than
this critical value the mass ratio is negative whereas charge ratios above this critical value
result in a positive value of µ/m. There is numerical evidence that each class of particles
has an upper bound for the charge ratio. Above this maximum charge ratio we were unable
to ﬁnd any solutions such that limx→∞ xF (x) → 0 or limx→∞ xG(x) → 0. This necessarily
restricts the deﬁnition of the mass ratio deﬁned above. Figure 4 also illustrates the fact that
at moderate charge ratios, the electromagnetic ﬁeld does not contain an appreciable amount
of the particle energy resulting in the behaviour |µ/m| ≃ ǫ/e.
The mass ratios of the ﬁrst and second excited states with respect to the ground state
solutions are shown in ﬁgure 5. This ratio is only deﬁned up to a maximum value of ǫ/e since
beyond ǫ/e ≃ 550, a ground state fails to exist. For excited states, this maximum admissible
charge ratio increases. This implies that for a ﬁxed value of ǫ/e there may not exist a ground
state solution, but there will be arbitrarily many excited states. As is readily apparent from

13

ﬁgure 5, the only appreciable mass splitting occurs for large charge ratios. However, it is
precisely for large charge ratios where our approximation that F G ≪ F 2 + G2 breaks down.

6 Concluding Remarks

We have seen that spherically symmetric Dirac-Maxwell solitons can be constructed and with
a charge and mass to model the electron successfully. However, it should be noted that the
higher energy excited states of this form did not yield the large mass separations of the muon
and tau relative to the electron in this model. The search thus far has been restricted to
spherical solitons. It is conceivable that a relaxation of this restriction or some other change
in conditions would increase the mass splitting. In any event, we have shown that Dirac-
Maxwell solitons exist and are capable of modelling an electron where the charge-to-mass
ratio is the observed ≃ 1021 in units in which G = c = 1. Furthermore, we have found a
charge-to-mass ratio that simultaneously yields the observed charge and mass of the electron
as well as exhibiting a degreee of compactiﬁcation that is well within the current experimental
upper limit. Finster et al.[8] have considered Einstein–Dirac–Maxwell (EDM) solitons and
concluded that it is the interaction with gravitation which is responsible for the existence
of bound states. However, we see here that bound states exist with negligible gravitational
interaction. While the e/m ratio at which signiﬁcant gravitational coupling sets in is yet to
be determined for EDM solitons, it is our conjecture that this will be so at the same level that
was found earlier in the case of minimally coupled scalar interaction[4], namely for e/m ≃ 1.
The known fundamental charged particles of nature, on the other hand have enormous e/m
ratios.

Figure 5: Mass ratios of the ﬁrst and second excited states with respect to the ground state.
There are essentially two regions of interest. For moderate charge ratios, the value of mn/m0 ≃ 1
with the mass ratio of the excited state n = 2 slightly larger than for the n = 1 state. Beyond the point
where the ground state mass ratio becomes unbounded, the mass ratios begin to split. In this region,
the |m1/m0| ratio exceeds the |m2/m0| ratio. In this region the approximation F G ≪ F 2 + G2 is no
longer valid.

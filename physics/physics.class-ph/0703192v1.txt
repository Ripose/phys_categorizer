Dissipative Boussinesq equations

Denys Dutykh∗

Fr´ed´eric Dias∗

Abstract

The classical theory of water waves is based on the theory of invis-
cid ﬂows. However it is important to include viscous eﬀects in some
applications. Two models are proposed to add dissipative eﬀects in
the context of the Boussinesq equations, which include the eﬀects of
weak dispersion and nonlinearity in a shallow water framework. The
dissipative Boussinesq equations are then integrated numerically.

1 Introduction

Boussinesq equations are widely used in coastal and ocean engineering.
One example among others is tsunami wave modelling. These equations
can also be used to model tidal oscillations. Of course, these types of wave
motion are perfectly described by the Navier-Stokes equations, but currently
it is impossible to solve fully three-dimensional (3D) models in any signiﬁcant
domain. Thus, approximate models such as the Boussinesq equations must
be used.

The years 1871 and 1872 were particularly important in the development
of the Boussinesq equations. It is in 1871 that Valentin Joseph Boussinesq
received the Poncelet prize from the Academy of Sciences for his work. In
the Volumes 72 and 73 of the “Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des S´eances
de l’Acad´emie des Sciences”, which cover respectively the six-month periods
January–June 1871 and July–December 1871, there are several contributions
of Boussinesq. On June 19, 1871, Boussinesq presents the now famous note
on the solitary wave entitled “Th´eorie de l’intumescence liquide appel´ee onde
solitaire ou de translation, se propageant dans un canal rectangulaire” (72,
pp. 755–759), which will be extended later in the note entitled “Th´eorie

g´en´erale des mouvements qui sont propag´es dans un canal rectangulaire hor-
izontal” (73, pp. 256–260). Saint-Venant presents a couple of notes of Boussi-
nesq entitled “Sur le mouvement permanent vari´e de l’eau dans les tuyaux
de conduite et dans les canaux d´ecouverts” (73, pp. 34–38 and pp. 101–
105). Saint-Venant himself publishes a couple of notes entitled “Th´eorie du
mouvement non permanent des eaux, avec application aux crues des rivi`eres
et `a l’introduction des mar´ees dans leur lit” (73, pp. 147–154 and pp. 237–
240). All these notes deal with shallow-water theory. On November 13, 1871,
Boussinesq submits a paper entitled “Th´eorie des ondes et des remous qui se
propagent le long d’un canal rectangulaire horizontal, en communiquant au
liquide contenu dans ce canal des vitesses sensiblement pareilles de la surface
au fond”, which will be published in 1872 in the Journal de Math´ematiques
Pures et Appliqu´ees (17, pp. 55–108).

Boussinesq [1872, 1871] included dispersive eﬀects for the ﬁrst time in the
Saint-Venant equations [de Saint-Venant, 1871]. One should mention that
Boussinesq’s derivation was restricted to 1+1 dimensions (x and t) and a hor-
izontal bottom. Boussinesq equations contain more physics than the Saint-
Venant equations but at the same time they are more complicated from the
mathematical and numerical point of views. These equations possess a hyper-
bolic structure (the same as in the nonlinear shallow-water equations) com-
bined with high-order derivatives to model wave dispersion. There have been
a lot of further developments of these equations like in Madsen and Schaﬀer
[1998], Nwogu [1993], Peregrine [1967], Wei et al. [1995].

Let us outline the physical assumptions. The Boussinesq equations are in-
tended to describe the irrotational motion of an incompressible homogeneous
inviscid ﬂuid in the long wave limit. The goal of this type of modelling is to
reduce 3D problems to two-dimensional (2D) ones. This is done by assum-
ing a polynomial (usually linear) vertical distribution of the ﬂow ﬁeld, while
taking into account non-hydrostatic eﬀects. This is the principal physical
diﬀerence with the nonlinear shallow-water (NSW) equations.

There are a lot of forms of the Boussinesq equations. This diversity is due
to diﬀerent possibilities in the choice of the velocity variable. In most cases
one chooses the velocity at an arbitrary water level or the depth-averaged
velocity vector. The resulting model performance is highly sensitive to linear
dispersion properties. The right choice of the velocity variable can signiﬁ-
cantly improve the propagation of moderately long waves. A good review
is given by Kirby [2003]. There is another technique used by Bona et al.
[2002]. Formally, one can transform higher-order terms by invoking lower-
order asymptotic relations. It provides an elegant way to improve the proper-
ties of the linear dispersion relation and it gives a quite general mathematical
framework to study these systems.

1 Introduction

The main purpose of this article is to include dissipative eﬀects in the
Boussinesq equations.
It is well-known that the eﬀect of viscosity on free
oscillatory waves on deep water was studied by Lamb [1932]. What is less
known is that Boussinesq himself studied this eﬀect as well. Boussinesq
wrote three related papers in 1895 in the “Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires
des S´eances de l’Acad´emie des Sciences”: (i) “Sur l’extinction graduelle de
la houle de mer aux grandes distances de son lieu de production : formation
des ´equations du probl`eme” (120, pp. 1381-1386), (ii) “Lois de l’extinction
de la houle en haute mer” (121, pp. 15-20), (iii) “Sur la mani`ere dont se
r´egularise au loin, en s’y r´eduisant `a une houle simple, toute agitation confuse
mais p´eriodique des ﬂots” (121, pp. 85-88). It should be pointed out that the
famous treatise on hydrodynamics by Lamb has six editions. The paragraphs
on wave damping are not present in the ﬁrst edition (1879) while they are
present in the third edition (1906). The authors did not have access to the
second edition (1895), so it is possible that Boussinesq and Lamb published
similar results at the same time. Indeed Lamb derived the decay rate of the
in paragraph 348 of the sixth
linear wave amplitude in two diﬀerent ways:
edition by a dissipation calculation (this is also what Boussinesq [1895] did)
and in paragraph 349 by a direct calculation based on the linearized Navier-
Stokes equations. Let α denote the wave amplitude, ν the kinematic viscosity
of the ﬂuid and k the wavenumber of the decaying wave. Boussinesq (see Eq.
(12) in Boussinesq [1895]) and Lamb both showed that

Equation (1) leads to the classical law for viscous decay of waves of amplitude

α, namely α

In the present paper, we use two diﬀerent models for dissipation and de-
rive corresponding systems of long-wave equations. There are several meth-
ods to derive the Boussinesq equations but the resulting equations are not
the same. So one expects the solutions to be diﬀerent. We will investigate
numerically whether corresponding solutions remain close or not.

One may ask why dissipation is needed in Boussinesq equations. First
of all, real world liquids are viscous. This physical eﬀect is “translated” in
the language of partial diﬀerential equations by dissipative terms (e.g. the
Laplacian in the Navier-Stokes equations). So, it is natural to have analogous
terms in the long wave limit. In other words, a non-dissipative model means
that there is no energy loss, which is not pertinent from a physical point of
view, since any ﬂow is accompanied by energy dissipation.

Let us mention an earlier numerical and experimental study by Bona et al.

[1981]. They pointed out the importance of dissipative eﬀects for accurate
long wave modelling. In the “R´esum´e” section one can read

[...]
it was found that the inclusion of a dissipative term was
much more important than the inclusion of the nonlinear term,
although the inclusion of the nonlinear term was undoubtedly
beneﬁcial in describing the observations [...].

The complexity of the mathematical equations due to the inclusion of this
term is negligible compared to the beneﬁt of a better physical description.

Let us consider the incompressible Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations for a

Newtonian ﬂuid:

where u∗(x, y, z, t) = (u∗, v∗, w∗)(x∗, y∗, z∗, t∗) is the ﬂuid velocity vector, p∗
the pressure, F∗ the body force vector, ρ the constant ﬂuid density and ν the
kinematic viscosity.

Switching to dimensionless variables by introducing a characteristic veloc-
ity U, a characteristic length L and a characteristic pressure ρU 2, neglecting
body forces1 in this discussion, the N-S equations become

where Re is the well-known dimensionless parameter known as the Reynolds
number and deﬁned as

From a physical point of view the Reynolds number is a measure of the
relative importance of inertial forces compared to viscous eﬀects. For typ-
ical tsunami propagation applications the characteristic particle velocity U
is about 5 cm/s and the characteristic wave amplitude, which we use here
as characteristic length scale, is about 1 m. The kinematic viscosity ν de-
pends on the temperature but its order of magnitude for water is 10−6 m2/s.
Considering that as the tsunami approaches the coast both the particle ve-
locity and the wave amplitude increase, one can write that the corresponding

1The presence or absence of body forces is not important for discussing viscous eﬀects.

Reynolds number is of the order of 105 or 106. This simple estimate clearly
shows that the ﬂow is turbulent (as many other ﬂows in nature).

It is a common practice in ﬂuid dynamics (addition of an “eddy viscos-
ity” into the governing equations for Large Eddy Simulations) to ignore the
small-scale vortices when one is only interested in large-scale motion. It can
signiﬁcantly simplify computational and modelling aspects. So the inclusion
of dissipation can be viewed as the simplest way to take into account the
turbulence.

1991, Skandrani et al., 1996, Spivak et al., 2002, Tuck, 1974] who included
dissipation due to viscosity in potential ﬂow solutions and there are also
authors [Heitner and Housner, 1970, Kennedy et al., 2000, Zelt, 1991] who
already included in Boussinesq models ad-hoc dissipative terms into momen-
tum conservation equations in order to model wave breaking. Modelling this
eﬀect is not the primary goal of the present paper, since the ﬂow is no longer
irrotational after wave breaking. Strictly speaking the Boussinesq equations
can no longer be valid at this stage. Nevertheless scientists and engineers
continue to use these equations even to model the run-up on the beach. In
our approach a suitable choice of the eddy viscosity, which is a function of
both space and time, can model wave breaking at least as well as in the
articles cited above.

2 Derivation of the Boussinesq equations

In order to derive the Boussinesq equations, we begin with the full water-

−

axis along the still water level and the z′

wave problem. A Cartesian coordinate system (x′, y′, z′) is used, with the x′
−
and y′
axis pointing vertically
upwards. Let Ωt be the ﬂuid domain in R3 which is occupied by an inviscid
and incompressible ﬂuid. The subscript t underlines the fact that the domain
varies with time and is not known a priori. The domain Ωt is bounded
below by the seabed z′ =
h′(x′, y′, t′) and above by the free surface z′ =
η′(x′, y′, t′).
In this section we choose the domain Ωt to be unbounded in
the horizontal directions in order to avoid the discussion on lateral boundary
conditions. The reason is twofold. First of all, the choice of the boundary
value problem (BVP) (e.g. generating and/or absorbing boundary, wall, run-
up on a beach) depends on the application under consideration and secondly,
the question of the well-posedness of the BVP for the Boussinesq equations is
essentially open. Primes stand for dimensional variables. A typical sketch of
the domain Ωt is given in Figure 1. If the ﬂow is assumed to be irrotational

where g denotes the acceleration due to gravity (surface tension eﬀects are
usually neglected for long-wave applications). It has been assumed implicitly
that the free surface is a graph and that the pressure is constant on the free
surface (no forcing). Moreover we assume that the total water depth remains
positive, i.e. η′ + h′ > 0 (there is no dry zone).

As written, this system of equations does not contain any dissipation.
Thus, we complete the free-surface dynamic boundary condition (2) by adding
a dissipative term to account for the viscous eﬀects2:

In this work we investigate two models for the dissipative term D′
φ′. For
simplicity, one can choose a constant dissipation model (referred hereafter as
Model I) which is often used (e.g. [Jiang et al., 1996]):

Model I:

D′

φ′ := δ1φ′.

There is a more physically realistic dissipation model which is obtained
upon balancing of normal stress on the free surface (e.g.
[Dias et al., 2007,
Ruvinsky et al., 1991, Zhang and Vinals, 1997]):

Model II:

D′

φ′ := δ2φ′

z′z′.

The derivation of Boussinesq equations is more transparent when one
works with scaled variables. Let us introduce the following independent and
dependent non-dimensional variables:

ﬁrst coeﬃcient viscous frequency (since it has the dimensions of a frequency)
and the second one kinematic viscosity (by analogy with the N-S equations).
It is interesting to estimate R2, since we know how to relate the value of
δ2 to the kinematic viscosity of water. Typical parameters which are used
in tsunami wave modelling are given in Table 1. For these parameters R2 =

2.1 Asymptotic expansion

eﬀect of turbulence is energy dissipation. Thus, one needs to increase the
importance of viscous terms in the governing equations in order to account
for turbulent dissipation.

As an example, we refer one more time to the work by Bona et al. [1981].
They modeled long wave propagation by using a modiﬁed dissipative Korteweg–
de Vries equation:

In numerical computations the authors took the coeﬃcient µ = 0.014. This
value gave good agreement with laboratory data.

From now on, we will use the notation νi := 1/Ri. This will allow us to
unify the physical origin of the numbers Ri with the eddy-viscosity approach.
In other words, for the sake of convenience, we will “forget” about the origin
of these coeﬃcients, because their values can be given by other physical
considerations.

2.1 Asymptotic expansion

Consider a formal asymptotic expansion of the velocity potential φ in

powers of the small parameter µ2:

φ = φ0 + µ2φ1 + µ4φ2 + . . . .

(10)

Then substitute this expansion into the continuity equation (5) and the

boundary conditions. After substitution, the Laplace equation becomes

µ2(

2φ0 + µ2

2φ1 + µ4

2φ2 + . . .) + φ0zz + µ2φ1zz + µ4φ2zz + . . . = 0.

problems of wave generation by a moving bottom the bathymetry h(x, y, t)
has the following special form in dimensionless variables:

h(x, y, t) := h0(x, y)

εζ(x, y, t),

(20)

−

where h0(x, y) is the static seabed and ζ(x, y, t) is the dynamic component
due to a seismic event or a landslide (see for example Dutykh and Dias [2007]
for a practical algorithm constructing ζ(x, y, t) in the absence of a dynamic
source model). The amplitude of the bottom motion has to be of the same
order of magnitude as the resulting waves, since we assume the ﬂuid to be
inviscid and incompressible. Thus (1/ε)ht =

ζt = O(1).

In the present study we restrict our attention to dispersion terms up to
order O(µ2). We will also assume that the Ursell-Stokes number [Ursell,
1953] is O(1):

−

S :=

ε
µ2 = O(1).

This assumption implies that terms of order O(ε2) and O(εµ2) must be ne-
glected, since

ε2 = S2µ4 = O(µ4),

εµ2 = Sµ4 = O(µ4).

Of course, it is possible to obtain high-order Boussinesq equations. We de-
cided not to take this research direction. For high-order asymptotic expan-
sions we refer to Madsen and Schaﬀer [1998], Wei et al. [1995]. Recently,
[Benoit, 2006] performed a comparative study between fully-nonlinear equa-
tions [Wei et al., 1995] and Boussinesq equations with optimized dispersion
relation [Nwogu, 1993]. No substantial diﬀerence was revealed.

Now, we are ready to derive dissipative Boussinesq equations in their
simplest form. First of all, we substitute the asymptotic expansion (10) into
the kinematic free-surface boundary condition (6):

φ0z + µ2φ1z + µ4φ2z = µ2ηt + εµ2

The equation for the evolution of the velocity ﬁeld is derived similarly
from the dynamic boundary condition (7). This derivation will depend on
the selected dissipation model. For both models one has to evaluate φ1, φ1t

3 Analysis of the linear dispersion relations

For simplicity, we will consider in this section only 2D problems. The
generalization to 3D problems is straightforward and does not change the
analysis.

3.1 Linearization of the full potential ﬂow equations

with dissipation

First we write down the linearization of the full potential ﬂow equations

in dimensional form, after dropping the primes:

∆φ = 0,
φz = ηt,
φt + gη + Dφ = 0,
φz = 0,

(28)

Remark: In this section the water layer is assumed to be of uniform

depth, so h = const.

As above the term Dφ depends on the selected dissipation model and is
equal to δ1φ or δ2φzz. The next step consists in choosing a special form of
solutions:

φ(x, z, t) = ϕ0ei(kx−ωt)ϕ(z),

η(x, t) = η0ei(kx−ωt),

(29)

where ϕ0 and η0 are constants. Substituting this form of solutions into equa-
tions (25), (26) and (28) yields the following boundary value problem for an
ordinary diﬀerential equation:

Straightforward computations give the solution to this problem:

The dispersion relation can be thought as a necessary condition for so-
lutions of the form (29) to exist. The problem is that ω and k cannot be
arbitrary. We obtain the required relation ω = ω(k), which is called the
dispersion relation, after substituting this solution into (27).

For our analysis it is more interesting to look at the phase speed which

is deﬁned as

cp(k) :=

ω(k)
k

.

The phase velocity is directly connected to the speed of wave propagation and
is extremely important for accurate tsunami modelling since tsunami arrival
time obviously depends on the propagation speed. The expressions for the
phase velocity are obtained from the corresponding dispersion relations (30)
and (31):

3.2 Dissipative Boussinesq equations

The analysis of the dispersion relation is even more straightforward for
Boussinesq equations. In order to be coherent with the previous subsection,
we switch to dimensional variables. As usual we begin with the (1 + 1)D
linearized equations:

ηt + hux =

Model I:
Model II:

ut + gηx + δ1u = 1

2 δ1h2uxx + 1

2h2uxxt,

ut + gηx = δ2uxx + 1

2h2uxxt.

Now we substitute a special ansatz in these equations:

η = η0ei(kx−ωt),

u = u0ei(kx−ωt),

where η0 and u0 are constants. In the case of the ﬁrst model, one obtains
the following homogeneous system of linear equations:

3.3 Discussion

3.3 Discussion

19

Let us now provide a discussion on the dispersion relations. The real and
imaginary parts of the phase velocities (33)–(36) for the full and long wave
linearized equations are shown graphically on Figures 2–7. In this example
the parameters are given by δ1 = 0.14, δ2 = 0.14. Together with the dissi-
pative models we also plotted for comparison the well-known phase velocity
corresponding to the full conservative (linearized) water-wave problem:

cp(k) =

gh

r

tanh(kh)
kh

.

First of all, one can see that dissipation is very selective, as is often the
case in physics. Clearly, the ﬁrst dissipation model prefers very long waves,
while the second model dissipates essentially short waves. Moreover one can
see from the expressions (33), (35) that the phase velocity has a 1/k singular
behaviour in the vicinity of kh = 0 (in the long wave limit). Furthermore, it
can be clearly seen in Figure 3 that very long linear waves are not advected
in the ﬁrst dissipation model, since the real part of their phase velocity is
identically equal to zero.

That is why we suggest to make use of the second model in applications

involving very long waves such as tsunamis.

On the other hand we would like to point out that the second model
admits a critical wavenumber kc such that the phase velocity (34) becomes
purely imaginary with negative imaginary part. From a physical point of
view it means that the waves shorter than kc are not advected, but only dis-
sipated. When one switches to the Boussinesq approximation, this property
disappears for physically realistic values of the parameters g, h and δ2 (see
Table 1).

Let us clarify this situation. The qualitative behaviour of the phase veloc-
pb (see equation (36)) depends on the roots of the following polynomial

4 Alternative version of the Boussinesq equa-

tions

In this section we give an alternative derivation of Boussinesq equa-
tions. We use another classical method for deriving Boussinesq-type equa-

4.1 Derivation of the equations

20

tions [Benjamin, 1974, Peregrine, 1972, Whitham, 1999], which provides
slightly diﬀerent governing equations. Namely, the hyperbolic structure is
the same, but the dispersive terms diﬀer. In numerical simulations we sug-
gest to use this system of equations.

The derivation follows closely the paper by Madsen and Schaﬀer [1998].
The main diﬀerences are that we neglect the terms of order O(µ4), take in
account a moving bathymetry and, of course, dissipative eﬀects which are
modelled this time according to model II (4) because, in our opinion, this
model is more appropriate for long wave applications. Anyhow, the derivation
process can be performed in a similar fashion for model I (3).

4.1 Derivation of the equations

The starting point is the same: equations (5), (6), (7) and (8). This time
the procedure begins with representing the velocity potential φ(x, y, z, t) as
a formal expansion in powers of z rather than of µ2:

∞

φ(x, y, z, t) =

znφn(x, y, t).

(37)

n=0
X
We would like to emphasize that this expansion is only formal and no con-
vergence result is needed. In other words, it is just convenient to use this
notation in asymptotic expansions but in practice, seldom more than four
terms are used. It is not necessary to justify the convergence of the sum with
three or four terms.

When we substitute the expansion (37) into Laplace equation (5), we
have an inﬁnite polynomial in z. Requiring that φ formally satisﬁes Laplace
equation implies that the coeﬃcients of each power of z vanish (since the
right-hand side is identically zero). This leads to the classical recurrence
relation

φn+2(x, y, t) =

µ2
(n + 1)(n + 2)∇

−

2φn(x, y, t),

n = 0, 1, 2, . . .

Using this relation one can eliminate all but two unknown functions in (37):

The following notation is introduced:

u0 := u(x, y, 0, t),

w0 :=

µ2 w(x, y, 0, t).

4.1 Derivation of the equations

more expansion:

0 (x, y, t) + µ2w(1)

0 (x, y, t) + . . . .

(42)

We insert this expansion into the asymptotic bottom boundary condition
(41). This leads to the following explicit expressions for w(0)

at z = zα, which gives the connection between u0 and uα:

Remark: Behind this change of variables there is one subtlety which is
generally hushed up in the literature. In fact, the wave motion is assumed to
be irrotational since we use the potential ﬂow formulation (5), (6), (7), (8) of
the water-wave problem. By construction rot(u, w) = 0 when u and w are
computed according to (44), (45) or, in other words, in terms of the variable
u0. When one turns to the velocity variable uα deﬁned at an arbitrary level,
one can improve the linear dispersion relation and this is important for wave
modelling. But on the other hand, one loses the property that the ﬂow is

4.1 Derivation of the equations

23

irrotational. That is to say, a direct computation shows that rot(u, w)
= 0
when u and w are expressed in terms of the variable uα. The purpose of
this remark is simply to inform the reader about the price to be paid while
improving the dispersion relation properties. It seems that this point is not
clearly mentioned in the literature on this topic.

Let us now derive the Boussinesq equations. There are two diﬀerent
methods to obtain the free-surface elevation equation. The ﬁrst method
consists in integrating the continuity equation (5) over the depth and then
use the kinematic free-surface and bottom boundary conditions. The second
way is more straightforward. It consists in using directly the kinematic free-
surface boundary condition (6):

Then one can substitute (38) into (6) and perform several simpliﬁcations.

Recall that ζ(x, y, t) is deﬁned according to (20). When the bathymetry is

division by ε in the source terms since this division can give the impression
that stiﬀ source terms are present in our problem, which is not the case.

In order to be able to optimize the dispersion relation properties, we
switch to the variable uα. Technically it is done by using the relation (46)
between u0 and uα. The result is given below:

Improvement of the linear dispersion relations

As said above, the idea of using one free parameter α

[0, 1] to optimize
the linear dispersion relation properties appears to have been proposed ﬁrst
by Nwogu [1993].

∈

The idea of manipulating the dispersion relation was well-known before
1993. See for example Madsen et al. [1991], Murray [1989]. But these authors
started with a desired dispersion relation and artiﬁcially added extra terms
to the momentum equation in order to produce the desired characteristics.
We prefer to follow the ideas of Nwogu [1993].

4.3 Bottom friction

25

Remark: When one plays with the dispersion relation it is important to
remember that the resulting problem must be well-posed, at least linearly.
We refer to Bona et al. [2002] as a general reference on this topic. Usually
Boussinesq-type models with good dispersion characteristics are linearly well-
posed as well.

In order to look for an optimal value of α we will drop dissipative terms.
Indeed we want to concentrate our attention on the propagation properties
which are more important.

The choice for the parameter α depends on the optimization criterion.
In the present work we choose α by comparing the coeﬃcients in the Taylor
expansions of the phase velocity in the vicinity of kh = 0, which corresponds
to the long-wave limit. Another possibility is to match the dispersion relation
of the full linearized equations (32) in the least square sense. One can also
use Pad´e approximants [Witting, 1984] since rational functions have better
approximation properties than polynomials.

We brieﬂy describe the procedure. First of all one has to obtain the phase
velocity of the linearized, non-viscous, Boussinesq equations (47)-(48). The
result is

4.3 Bottom friction

In this subsection, one switches back to dimensional variables.

It is a
common practice in hydraulics engineering to take into account the eﬀect of
bottom friction or bottom rugosity. In the Boussinesq and nonlinear shallow
water equations there is also a possibility to include some kind of empirical

5 Spectral Fourier method

26

terms to model these physical eﬀects. From the mathematical and especially
numerical viewpoints these terms do not add any complexity, since they have
the form of source terms that do not involve diﬀerential operators. So it is
highly recommended to introduce these source terms in numerical models.

There is no unique bottom friction law. Most frequently, Ch´ezy and
Darcy-Weisbach laws are used. Both laws have similar structures. We give
here these models in dimensional form. The following terms have to be
added to the source terms of Boussinesq equations when one wants to include
bottom friction modelling.

5 Spectral Fourier method

In this study we adopted a well-known and widely used spectral Fourier
method. The main idea consists in discretizing the spatial derivatives using
Fourier transforms. The eﬀectiveness of this method is explained by two main
reasons. First, the diﬀerentiation operation in Fourier transform space is ex-
tremely simple due to the following property of Fourier transforms: f ′ = ikf .

5 Spectral Fourier method

27

Secondly, there are very powerful tools for the fast and accurate computation
of discrete Fourier transforms (DFT). So, spatial derivatives are computed
with the following algorithm:

ﬀt (f )
ikf
iﬀt (v)

1: f
2: v
3: f ′
where k is the wavenumber.

←
←
←

This approach, which is extremely eﬃcient, has the drawbacks of almost
all spectral methods. The ﬁrst drawback consists in imposing periodic bound-
ary conditions since we use DFT. The second drawback is that we can only
handle simple geometries, namely, Cartesian products of 1D intervals. For
the purpose of academic research, this type of method is appropriate.

Let us now consider the discretization of the dissipative Boussinesq equa-
tions. We show in detail how the discretization is performed on equations
(22), (24). The other systems are discretized in the same way. We chose
equations (22), (24) in order to avoid cumbersome expressions and make the
description as clear as possible.

Let us apply the Fourier transform to both sides of equations (22), (24):

(51)

Equations (50) and (51) constitute a system of ordinary diﬀerential equa-
tions to be integrated numerically. In the present study we use the classical
explicit fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.

Remark on stability: A lot of researchers who integrated numerically

the KdV equation noticed that the stability criterion has the form

∆t =

λ
N 2 ,

where λ is the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number and N the number
of points of discretization.
In order to increase the time integration step
∆t they solved exactly the linear part of the partial diﬀerential equation
since the linear term is the one involving high frequencies and constraining
the stability. This method, which is usually called the integrating factor

5.1 Validation of the numerical method

28

method, allows an increase of the CFL number up to a factor ten, but it
cannot ﬁx the dependence on 1/N 2.

We do not have this diﬃculty because we use regularized dispersive terms.
The regularization eﬀect can be seen from equation (51). The same idea was
exploited by Bona et al. [1981], who used the modiﬁed KdV equation (9).

Let us brieﬂy explain how we treat the non-linear terms. Since the time
integration scheme is explicit, one can easily handle nonlinearities. For ex-
ample the term (h + εη)u is computed as follows:

(h + εη)u = ﬀt ((h + ε Re iﬀt (η))

Re iﬀt (u)) .

·

The other nonlinear terms are computed in the same way.

5.1 Validation of the numerical method

One way to validate a numerical scheme is to compare the numerical re-
sults with analytical solutions. Unfortunately, the authors did not succeed
in deriving analytical solutions to the (1 + 1)D dissipative Boussinesq equa-
tions over a ﬂat bottom. But for validation purposes, one can neglect the
viscous term. With this simpliﬁcation several solitary wave solutions can be
obtained. We follow closely the work of Chen [1998]. In (1 + 1)D in the pres-
ence of a ﬂat bottom, the Boussinesq system without dissipation becomes

ηt + ux + ε(uη)x −

uxxx = 0,

ut + ηx + εuux −
We look for solitary-wave solutions travelling to the left in the form

uxxt = 0.

η(x, t) = η(ξ) = η(x0 + x + ct),

u(x, t) = Bη(ξ),

(52)

(53)

where we introduced the new variable ξ = x0 + x + ct and B, c, x0 are
constants. From the physical point of view this change of variables is nothing
else than Galilean transformation. In other words we choose a new frame of
reference which moves with the same celerity as the solitary wave. Since c is
constant (there is no acceleration), the observer moving with the wave will
see a steady picture.

In the following primes denote derivation with respect to ξ. Substituting

this special form into the governing equations (52)-(53) gives

The solution is integrable on R and there are no integration constants, since
a priori the solution behaviour at inﬁnity is known: the solitary wave is
exponentially small at large distances from the crest. Mathematically it can
be expressed as

lim
ξ→±∞

η(x, t) = lim

u(x, t) = 0.

Note that this exact solitary wave solution is not physical. Indeed the
velocity is negative whereas one expects it to be positive for a depression
wave propagating to the left. In any case, the goal here is to validate the
numerical computations by comparing with an exact solution. The method-
ology is simple. We choose a solitary wave as initial condition and let it
propagate during a certain time T with the spectral method. At the end of
the computations one computes the L∞ norm of the diﬀerence between the
analytical solution (57) and the numerical one ˜η(x, T ):

Figure 8 shows the graph of ǫN as a function of N. This result shows
an excellent performance of this spectral method with an exponential con-
vergence rate. In general, the error ǫN is bounded below by the maximum
between the error due to the time integration algorithm and ﬂoating point
arithmetic precision.

The exponential convergence rate to the exact solution is one of the fea-
tures of spectral methods. It explains the success of these methods in several
domains such as direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence. One of the
main drawbacks of spectral methods consists in the diﬃculties in handling
complex geometries and various types of boundary conditions.

and look for u in the following form:

u =

η + εP + µ2Q + O(ε2 + εµ2 + µ4).

−

It is precisely at this step that one makes an approximation. One substitutes
this asymptotic expansion into the governing equations and retains only the
terms of order O(ε + µ2):

ηηx = 0,

Since the water depth is h = 1 + εη = 1 + O(ε), the approximate solitary
wave should travel to the left with a celerity c = 1 + O(ε) and depend on the
variable x + ct = x + t + O(ε). Consequently one has the following relations:

6.2 Comparison between the dissipative models

The snapshot of the function η(x, y, t0) (divided by 10 for clarity’s sake)
during and just after reﬂection by the step is given on Figure 9. Recall
that the free surface is given by z = εη. Then we compare the two sets of
equations (22), (23) and (22), (24). To do so we look at the section of the
free surface at y = 0 along the propagation direction.

Figure 10 shows that even at the beginning of the computations the two
models give slightly diﬀerent results. The amplitude of the pulse obtained
with model I is smaller. It can be explained by the presence of the term ν1Su
2u. Within graphical accuracy, there
which is bigger in magnitude than εν2∇
is almost no diﬀerence between the conservative case and model II.

In Figure 11 one can see that diﬀerences between the two solitons continue
In particular we see an important drawback of the dissipation
to grow.
model I: just after the wave crest the free surface has some kind of residual
deformation which is clearly non-physical. Our numerical experiments show
that the amplitude of this residue depends almost linearly on the parameter
ν1. We could hardly predict this eﬀect directly from the equations without
numerical experiments.

We would like to point out several soliton transformations in Figure 12 due
to the interaction with bathymetry. First of all, since the depth decreases, the

wave amplitude grows. Quantitatively speaking, the wave amplitude before
the interaction is equal exactly to 8 (without including dissipation) and over
the step it becomes roughly 9.4. On the other hand the soliton becomes less
symmetric which is also expected. Because of periodic numerical boundary
conditions we also observe the residue of the free-surface deformation coming
through the left boundary.

Figures 13, 14 and 15 show the process of wave reﬂection from the step

at the bottom. The reﬂected wave clearly moves in the opposite direction.

7 Conclusions

Comparisons have been made between two dissipation models. Model II,
in which the decay is proportional to the second derivative of the velocity,
appears to be better. At this stage we cannot show comparisons with lab-
oratory experiments in order to demonstrate the performance of model II.
Nevertheless, there is an indirect evidence. We refer one more time to the
theoretical as well as experimental work of Bona et al. [1981]. In order to
model wave trains, they added to the Korteweg–de Vries equation an ad-hoc
dissipative term in the form of the Laplacian (but in 1D). This term coincides
with the results of our derivation if we model dissipation in the equations ac-

cording to the second model. Their work shows excellent agreement between
experiments and numerical solutions to dissipative KdV equation. Moreover
our dissipative Boussinesq equations are in the same relationship with the
classical Boussinesq equations [Peregrine, 1967] as Euler and Navier-Stokes
equations. This is a second argument towards the physical pertinency of the
results obtained with model II.

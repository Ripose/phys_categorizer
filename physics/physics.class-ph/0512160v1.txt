Abstract

The idea of the Michelson–Morley experiment is theoretically reanalyzed. Ele-
mentary arguments are put forward indicating that, rigorously, conclusions follow-
ing from the experiment impose rather weak constraints on the angular dependence
of the speed of light.

According to XIX-century physics light was supposed to propagate in the aether,
a mysterious medium devised especially for this purpose. As light was to travel with
respect to the aether with a ﬁxed speed, an experiment was suggested to detect the
dependence of the speed on the direction in a moving frame of the laboratory on the
Earth. The experiment was proposed and the ﬁrst time performed by Albert Michelson
(a Nobel laureate, American physicist born in Poland) [1]. The experiment is contin-
ually being repeated, known as the Michelson–Morley (MM) experiment, with ever
increasing accuracy and improved technical realization (see, e.g., [2]). The result is
always the same, negative, i.e. no dependence of the speed of light on the direction
has been detected, at least, this is a standard (but not rigorous) conclusion. As a con-
sequence, the speed of light is the same in each inertial frame in any direction, and no
aether exists.

An elementary theoretical analysis of the MM experiment proposed in this paper
yields a general solution. In other words, we show that the standard, negative result
of the MM experiment imposes only very mild constrains on the angular dependence
(anisotropy) of the speed of light, too mild to exclude the idea of the aether at all. It is
not our intention to revitalize the idea of the aether but only we would like to quantify
the freedom allowed by the MM experiment.

Let us brieﬂy recall the idea of the MM experiment. In any, traditional or modern,
version of the experiment we compare the differences of the time of the travel of light
in two orthogonal directions (vertical and horizontal, say) in two positions (primary
and ﬁnal) differing by 90◦. To arrive at our result we assume full generality. Therefore,
let us introduce the following notation (see Fig. 1):

c⊥
+ — forward vertical speed of light,
c⊥
− — backward vertical speed of light,
cq
+ — forward horizontal speed of light,
cq
− — backward horizontal speed of light,

and

L1 — primarily vertical route,
L2 — primarily horizontal route.

The negative result of the MM experiment formally means D

t∗ = 0. (Our analysis is
purely theoretical, and we are not going to engage into the debate whether the equality
t∗ = 0 is experimentally well-established or not.) A very (in fact, too) simpliﬁed but
common argumentation says that the equality D

t∗ = 0 implies c⊥

− = cq

−.

+ = c⊥

A bit less simpliﬁed, and also very common, argumentation presumes a strictly
deﬁned form of c⊥
± following from geometrical analysis (the Pythagorean theorem
and geometrical addition of velocities) of the movement of inertial systems with respect
to the aether, i.e.

where c — speed of light with respect to the aether, v — velocity of the inertial system
with respect to the aether. The possibility (6)-(7) is also excluded by virtue of the
t∗ = 0, where D
experimental fact D
t∗ is deﬁned by Eq. (5). But there is inﬁnitely many
other possibilities consistent with D
t∗ deﬁned by Eq. (5) equal to zero. The aim of the
paper is to bring this fact to the reader’s attention.

We can rewrite the equation D

t∗ = 0 with D

t∗ deﬁned by Eq. (5) in the following

+ + z⊥
z⊥

− = zq

+ + zq
−,

where for simplicity we use inverses of the speeds, z ≡ 1/c. Eq. (8) is a functional
equation with continuum of solutions.

Let us consider the two-dimensional case, ﬁrst. The simplest way to solve the
problem in two dimensions is to analyze a picture (see, Fig. 2). The length of the
vector~z in Fig. 2 corresponds to the inverse of the speed of light in the direction of ~z.
Thus, the circle corresponds to a constant (independent of the direction) speed of light.
Since Eq. (8) is a single equation with four unknowns, the three unknowns are arbitrary
and determine the fourth one. For example, the three coordinates: of the black dot, of
the intersections of the solid curve with positive y and positive x axes respectively
are arbitrary, and they determine the coordinate of the white dot satisfying Eq. (8).
Analogously, the whole solid curve in Fig. 2 is practically arbitrary (it should only
be unique as a continuous function of polar coordinates) and determines the (dotted)
segment with negative coordinates x and y. As a side remark, we observe that changing
the angle between the arms of the MM interferometer changes the dotted segment.

functional equation (8).

Namely, the angle between the vectors ~z pointing at the black dot and the white dot,
respectively, is equal to the greater angle between the arms of the interferometer. In
principle, the whole curve could be discontinuous in two dotted points. But we can
easily avoid this possibility by appropriate deformation of the primary solid curve.
We could also require the mirror symmetry of the curve. For example, the axis of
the symmetry could be interpreted as the direction of the movement of the laboratory
frame, in the spirit of the aether philosophy. A general solution would be determined
by an arbitrary solid curve (see Fig. 3) starting at the black dot (as in Fig. 2) and
terminating at the intersection with the line y = x. Mirror reﬂection with respect to
the line y = x reproduces the rest of the curve except the last quarter, which should
by constructed according to (8) as described earlier in this paragraph. One can easily
check that, thanks to the mirror symmetry, this time, the whole curve is automatically
continuous provided the primary segment is continuous.

Up to now we have been considering an unphysical two-dimensional construc-
tion. It appears that in three dimensions constraints are a bit stronger, and the three-
dimensional case is qualitatively different. Therefore, we present now an explicit
three-dimensional analysis. We will determine directional dependence of the speed
of light consistent with MM-type experiments. Thus, roughly, we are interested in
non-constant (continuous) functions on a sphere S2, z(x) 6= const, deﬁning (the inverse
of) the speed of light in the direction associated to x ∈ S2, i.e., if we place the interfer-
ometer in the center of the interior of S2, the values of the all four z’s (z⊥
±) are given
by the values of the function z(x) for x belonging to the points of S2 corresponding
to appropriate axes of the interferometer. The only constraint for the values of z(x)

is given by Eq. (8). For any conﬁguration of the interferometer two z’s correspond to
the upper hemisphere of S2 and the other two to the lower one. The two upper points
uniquely determine the positions of the other two. Therefore, we can conﬁne ourselves
to consideration of the two points on the upper hemisphere. We can project the upper
hemisphere onto a two-dimensional disc D2. Let us now deﬁne an auxiliary function
on D2, ¯z(y), y ∈ D2, where informally ¯z = z+ + z−, i.e. the value of ¯z is the sum of the
opposite z’s. It is easy to show that ¯z has to be a constant function on D2. It indirectly
follows from Eq. (8) by virtue of transitivity. Namely, we can connect arbitrary two
points B and C on D2, and compare the corresponding values of ¯z using an additional
auxiliary point A, and next apply Eq. (8) to the both pairs (see Fig. 4). The pair B,
C does not, in general, corresponds to a position of the interferometer, but the both
pairs B, A and C, A, by construction, do. Since ¯z(B) = ¯z(A) and ¯z(C) = ¯z(A), then
¯z(B) = ¯z(C), and ¯z = const, say ¯z = 2c−1

0 , with c0 positive.

The constancy of ¯z is a strong restriction, not having a counterpart in two dimen-
sions. To decipher this restriction let us now consider an auxiliary function z+ on D2
corresponding to one of z’s entering the sum deﬁning ¯z, say z+, then z− = ¯z − z+. The
continuous function z+ is almost arbitrary and the only restriction, of topological na-
ture, is coming from the fact that the sum of the values of z+ on opposite sides of the
boundary of D2 should be equal 2c−1
0 .

This simple informal discussion could also be summarized in more mathemati-
cal terms. First of all, “in the ﬁrst approximation”, we can observe that the constant
function ¯z on D2 is actually a constant function on a two-dimensional real projective
surface RP2. It should seem acceptable, because identiﬁcation of opposite points of
S2 provides RP2 by deﬁnition, or in other words, we are interested in functions on a

set of rays rather than on a set of directions. For further convenience, we shift the
function down to zero, which is a kind of additive normalization. What is less obvious,
we claim that we now deal with a twisted real linear bundle B over the base manifold
RP2. The “shifted” ¯z denoted as ˜¯z is a zero cross-section of B, whereas the (shifted)
function z+ denoted as ˜z+ becomes an arbitrary continuous cross-section of B. The
form (the twist) of the bundle B follows from the observation that the values of ˜z+
on opposite sides of the boundary of D2 (at the identiﬁed points) should be opposite,
i.e., the non-trivial element of the discrete group Z2, coming from the corresponding
principal bundle, acts in the ﬁber R (Fig. 5). To exclude negative speeds of light, and
consequently negative times of the travel of light, we can limit the real values of ˜z’s to
0 , and we can speak on the interval bundle ¯¯B instead of the linear
the interval |˜z| ≤ c−1
bundle B. Recapitulating, we could state that all solutions of the problem (angular-
dependent speeds of light consistent with the null-effect of the MM experiment) are
parameterized by cross-sections of the non-trivial bundle ¯¯B. Obviously, non-constant
solutions (non-zero cross-sections) do exist. We could also choose an axially sym-
metric solution on demand. Still the simplest possibility corresponding to Eq. (6) and
Eq. (7) is excluded, but some mild deformations, e.g. expressed in the framework of
the Mansouri–Sexl test theory with the parameters a2 = b2

In concluding remarks we refer, generally, to existent literature. In numerous ex-
perimentally inclined papers the negative result of the MM experiment is often over
interpreted as a proof of the isotropy of the speed of light (see, e.g., the second para-
graph in [2]). Instead, in more theoretically inclined literature it is often emphasized

that in the context of the MM experiment (and not only) one should speak about the
two-way speed of light rather than about the one-way one [4]. In fact, our result that
cross-sections of the bundle ¯¯B parameterize the admissible one-way speeds of light
is a reﬁnement of the above-mentioned statement. The two-dimensional case is even
less restrictive than three-dimensional one (richer in a sense) but as unphysical is less
interesting.

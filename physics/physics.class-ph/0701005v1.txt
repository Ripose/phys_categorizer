Abstract

An unexpected prediction of classical electrodynamics is that a charge can accelerate before a

force is applied. We would expect that a preaccelerated charge would radiate so that there would

be spontaneous preradiation, an acausal phenomenon. We reexamine the subtle relation between

the Larmor formula for the power radiated by a point charge and the Abraham-Lorentz equation

and ﬁnd that for well-behaved external forces acting for ﬁnite times, the charge does not radiate in

time intervals where there is preacceleration. That is, for these forces preradiation does not exist

even though the charge is preaccelerated. The radiative energy is emitted only in time intervals

when the external force acts on the charge.

INTRODUCTION

A universally accepted idea is that an accelerated charge radiates. However, Abbott

and Griﬃths1 have found some extended conﬁgurations with sinusoidal currents that do

not radiate for certain special frequencies for which the external ﬁelds are exactly zero.

They refer to other work in which similar conﬁgurations involving acceleration without

radiation has been discussed.1 The fact that acceleration without radiation occurs when

the external ﬁelds are exactly zero cannot be considered a fortuitous result attributable

to extended conﬁgurations. We would expect that a point charge and an extended charge

would radiate only when an external force acts on them. To understand why acceleration

without radiation is possible we should also consider the radiation reaction force because

the emission of radiation is generally accompanied by a radiation reaction, a recoil force

attributable to the ﬁelds acting back on the charge.

For a point charge e of mass m acceleration without radiation when the external force

vanishes is not supported by the Larmor formula for the instantaneous power radiated:

where τ = 2e2/(3mc3). The Abraham-Lorentz (AL) equation of motion includes the radia-

tion reaction force:

P = mτ a2,

ma = F + mτ ˙a,

(1)

(2)

where F(t) is an external force and a dot means time diﬀerentiation. Equation (2) states

that the charge can accelerate even when F vanishes and it should radiate because of Eq. (1).

It is generally believed that radiation without the intervention of an external force occurs

in the preacceleration eﬀect.2–4 To avoid runaway solutions in Eq. (2) we can assume that

a(∞) = 0,3 but Eq. (2) predicts preacceleration: the charge accelerates before the force acts

on it. The charge should then radiate because of Eq. (1). Therefore, Eqs. (1) and (2) predict

the existence of preradiation: the charge radiates before the external force acts on it.

Although it is diﬃcult to understand how acausal preaccelerations can exist in the context

of a classical theory, it is even more challenging to understand how spontaneous preradiation

can occur. Radiation in classical electrodynamics is expected to be an observable quantity.

But how can radiation be detected when we have still not acted on the charge? No direct or

indirect experimental evidence of acausal preradiation has been reported. The existence of

2

preradiation could be questioned because we can have acceleration without radiation when

the external ﬁelds are zero.1

In this paper we reexamine the subtle relation between Eqs. (1) and (2) and ﬁnd that

for well-behaved external forces acting for ﬁnite times, the charge does not radiate in time

intervals where there is preacceleration. That is, for these forces preradiation does not exist

even though the charge is preaccelerated. The radiative energy is emitted only in time

intervals when the external force acts on the charge.

II. THE PRERADIATION PHENOMENON

We review examples of preradiation for the following external forces: (A) Dirac delta

force; (B) well-behaved force acting on a ﬁnite time; (C) periodical force acting on entire

cycles and (D) constant force acting on a ﬁnite time. Examples (A) and (D) are problems

of Griﬃth’s textbook.4–7 Examples (C) and (D) are special cases of the example (B).

A. The Dirac delta force

Preradiation can be illustrated by an example due to Dirac2 in which a charge is disturbed

by a momentary pulse represented by a delta function acting only at t = 0:5

where k > 0. The nonrunaway solution of Eq. (2) for this force is given by:5

F (t) = kδ(t),

The total radiated energy in the interval (t1, t2) is calculated with the formula

For the force in Eq. (3) the total radiated energy is given by:5

,

which is radiated only during the preacceleration interval (−∞, 0). Equation (6) is an

example of pure preradiation.

Preradiation seems to exist for a more realistic external force beginning at t = 0 and

lasting until t = T ,

where f(t) is a well-behaved function of time. We note that Eq. (7) represents a family of

forces. By assuming the condition a(∞) = 0, we can obtain the nonrunaway solution of

Eq. (2) for the force in Eq. (7):

where the function g(t) is given by

a(t) =

The total radiated energy WR(−∞, ∞) is obtained by adding the contributions in the in-
tervals (−∞, 0) and (0, T ). Note that WR(T, ∞) = 0. From Eqs. (5) and (8) we obtain

WR(−∞, ∞) =

[g(T ) − g(0)]2 + mτ

[g(T ) − g(t)]2e2t/τ dt.

The ﬁrst term in Eq. (10) is the energy radiated in the interval (−∞, 0) and the second term

is the energy radiated in the interval (0, T ). The external force does not act in (−∞, 0),

but in this interval the charge is preaccelerated (see Eq. (8)) yielding the radiative energy

appearing in the ﬁrst term of Eq. (10), which represents another example of preradiation.

C. Periodical external force

As a special case of Eq. (7) we consider the periodic force acting for n cycles:

F (t) =

k sin(ωt),

(0 ≤ t ≤ T )

(11)

(t ≤ 0)

(t ≥ T )

g(t) = −

ke−t/τ
m(1 + ω2τ 2)

[ωτ cos(ωt) + sin(ωt)].

(12)

The nonrunaway solution of Eq. (2) when the external force is speciﬁed by Eq. (11) can be

obtained from Eqs. (8) and (12):

a(t) =



α[et/τ − e(t−T )/τ ],

α[sin(ωt)/ωτ + cos(ωt) − e(t−T )/τ ],

(t ≤ 0)

(0 ≤ t ≤ T )

(t ≥ T )

(13)

where α = kωτ /(m[1 + ω2τ 2]). From Eqs. (5) and (13) or from Eqs. (10) and (12) we can

obtain the total radiated energy:

interval (−∞, 0) and the second term is the energy radiated in the interval (0, T ). After a

To verify that the energy is conserved in the interval (−∞, ∞) we ﬁrst need to ﬁnd the

velocities associated with Eq. (13). By assuming v(−∞) = 0 we ﬁnd

ατ (et/τ − e(t−T )/τ ),

v(t) =

α[ωτ sin(ωt) − cos(ωt) − ω2τ 2e(t−T )/τ + ω2τ 2 + 1]/ω2τ,

Equation (17c) shows that the energy is conserved in the interval (−∞, ∞): the work done

by the external force is equal to the change of kinetic energy (in this case it is zero because

v(±∞) = 0) plus the radiated energy which is given by Eq. (15).

(24b)

(24c)

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (24c) is the ﬁnal kinetic energy (the initial kinetic

energy is assumed to be zero) and the second term is the total radiated energy. Therefore

Eq. (24c) shows that the energy is conserved, that is, the work done by the external force is

equal to the change of kinetic energy plus the total radiated energy.

III. THE NON-EXISTENCE OF THE PRERADIATION PHENOMENON

In Sec. II we have presented examples of acausal preradiative terms. However, acausal

terms are physically unacceptable in purely classical considerations. Consistence of classical

electrodynamics demands that acausal terms should not contribute to observable quantities.8

Therefore, the acausal preradiative terms should be natural and systematically eliminated

from the total radiative energy.

We note in particular that the second term in Eq. (21) can be written as
k2τ 2
2m

k2τ

The last term of Eq. (25) exactly cancels the ﬁrst (preradiative) term: k2τ 2(1−e−T /τ )2/(2m)

k2τ 2
2m

(25)

of Eq. (21) so that Eqs. (21) and (25) imply Eq. (22) for the total radiated energy. A similar

cancellation of the preradiative term in Eq. (14) occurs, that is, the second term of Eq. (14)

contains a part that exactly cancels its ﬁrst (preradiative) term so that the total energy

radiated is given by Eq. (15). Equation (25) seems to be the result of an integration by

parts. Therefore, let us consider an integration by parts for the general case given by

Eq. (10). After integration by parts, we see that the second term in Eq. (10):

contains a part that exactly cancels its ﬁrst (preradiative) term, so that Eqs. (10) and (26)

give the eﬀective radiated energy

(28b)

Equations (10) and (27) represent the same energy, but the trouble with Eq. (10) is that

it explicitly exhibits a misleading time separation of energy in the interval of preacceleration

(−∞, 0) and the interval (0, T ), although Eq. (27) shows that the energy is radiated only

during (0, T ) which is the interval when the force acts. We conclude that there is no eﬀective

energy radiated during (−∞, 0), which is the interval when there is preacceleration. In other

words: there does not exist preradiation for the family of external forces speciﬁed by Eq. (7),

even though the charge is preaccelerated.

Rohrlich9 has emphasized that there are many equations that have multiple solutions

some of which are not realized in nature, and we should distinguish between the existence of

a mathematical solution and its physical existence. For instance, the AL equation has two

solutions: a = 0 and a(t) = a(0)et/τ , but only the former is physically possible. Advanced

solutions of Maxwell’s equations violating the causality principle are another example of

solutions that are not physical. Analogously, acausal preaccelerations (of well-behaved ex-

ternal forces) exist mathematically (as an implication of the AL equation) but not physically

because they do not originate radiation.

IV. PRERADIATION AND THE KINETIC-RADIATIVE ENERGY

We note that the preradiative term in Eq. (10) eﬀectively depends on the value of the

acceleration at t = 0:

WR(−∞, 0) =

[g(T ) − g(0)]2 =

mτ 2
2

mτ 2[a(0)]2
2

.

(29)

It follows that from a formal point of view the elimination of preradiation implied by Eqs.

(10) and (26) occurs at t = 0. To ﬁnd how is the general dependence of the preradiative

energies with respect the values of the acceleration, let us separate the interval of preacceler-

ation (−∞, 0) into the intervals (−∞, −t0) and (−t0, 0). After a simple calculation, we ﬁnd
WR(−∞, −t0) = mτ 2[a(−t0)]2/2 and WR(−t0, 0) = mτ 2 ([a(0)]2 − [a(−t0)]2) /2. The latter

8

term depends on the value of the acceleration at the initial and ﬁnal times of the interval

(−t0, 0). But the time −t0 is arbitrary and thus we have here a ﬁrst lesson on preradiation:

the energy emitted during the interval of preacceleration depends on the initial and ﬁnal

values of the acceleration in that interval.

Equations (15) and (22) are examples of energy radiated by a charge during the interval

(−∞, ∞). To calculate these energies we have essentially combined Eqs. (1) and (2), assumed

the condition a(∞) = 0 and integrated from t = −∞ to t = ∞. The justiﬁcation for the

combination of Eqs. (1) and (2) is that the emission of radiation is generally accompanied

by a radiation reaction. The justiﬁcation for the assumption a(∞) = 0 is that it implies

nonrunaway solutions. The justiﬁcation for the integration over all time is that radiation is

a process that occurs during a time interval rather than at one time.

To generalize the method used to obtain Eqs. (15) and (22), we identify the acceleration

in Eq. (1) with that appearing in Eq. (2) and obtain:

In analogy to the kinetic energy T = mv2/2, we deﬁne the kinetic-radiative energy as

P = τ a · F +

interval:

The integration of Eq. (32) over the interval (t1, t2) gives the energy radiated during that

t1
where ∆TR(t1, t2) = TR(t2) − TR(t1). If the force vanishes in the interval (t1, t2) then

WR(t1, t2) = τ

a · F dt + ∆TR(t1, t2),

t2

Z

WR(t1, t2) = ∆TR(t1, t2),

according to which the radiated energy in (t1, t2) is given by the change of the kinetic-

radiative energy in that interval. In particular, preradiation occurs when the external force

is zero and therefore the preradiative terms satisfy Eq. (34). We have here a second lesson on

preradiation which makes more precise the ﬁrst lesson: the energy emitted in the interval of

preacceleration (t1, t2) is given by the change of the kinetic-radiative energy in that interval.

(33)

(34)

A well-behaved force subject only to the condition that it is switched on in the distant

past and switched oﬀ in the distant future, that is, f(±∞) = 0, is physically realizable.

In solving Eq. (2) for the force in Eq. (7) we imposed the condition3 a(∞) = 0 to obtain

the nonrunaway solution (8), which implies the condition a(−∞) = 0. In other words: the

nonrunaway solutions of Eq. (2) for well-behaved forces satisfy the boundary conditions

a(±∞) = 0,10 which indicate that the charge begins and ends the motion as a free particle11

and imply ∆TR(±∞) = 0. We have here a third lesson on preradiation: the nonrunaway
solutions of the AL equation for well-behaved external forces satisfy ∆TR(±∞) = 0 and

therefore the associated preradiative energy is vanished.

On the other hand, if the solution of Eq. (2) in the interval (t1, t2) is such that it vanishes

at t = t1 and t = t2 then ∆TR(t1, t2) = 0 and Eq. (31) reduces to the expression

WR(t1, t2) = τ

a · F dt,

t2

Z

t1

which causally links the radiated energy with the external force in such a way that the energy

is radiated only in the interval when the force acts. From Eqs. (5) and (35) we obtain

a · F dt + ∆TR(t1, t2),

which shows that the subtle diﬀerence between Eqs. (5) and (35) is that the latter equation

implicitly assumes ∆TR(t1, t2) = 0.

Let us now apply Eq. (35) to the family of forces speciﬁed by Eq. (7). The associated

nonrunaway solution satisﬁes ∆TR(±∞) = 0. If Eqs. (7) and (8) are used in Eq. (35) with
t1 = −∞ and t2 = ∞, we obtain the result in Eq. (27):

WR(−∞, ∞) = τ

V. ENERGY CONSERVATION

To verify that the energy is conserved in the time interval (−∞, ∞) if the external force

is given by Eq. (7), we need to ﬁnd the velocities associated with Eq. (8). By assuming

v(−∞) = 0, we ﬁnd

(35)

(36)

(38)

v(t) =

where V(t) is the velocity of the charge when the radiation reaction is not considered. The

work done by the external force (7) is then given by

(39a)

(39b)

The ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of Eq. (39b) is the ﬁna kinetic energy (the initial is

assumed to be zero) and the second term is the total radiated energy given by Eq. (37).

Equation (39b) indicates that the energy is conserved in the interval (−∞, ∞), that is, the

work done by the external force equals the change of kinetic energy plus the total radiated

energy.

It follows that energy conservation in Eq. (39b) supports the conclusion that the

energy is radiated only during the interval when the force acts. Applications of Eq. (39b)

are given by Eqs. (17c) and (24c).

VI. DISCONTINUOUS FORCES

We have successfully applied Eq. (27) to the force (7) which is not diﬀerentiable at t = 0

and t = T . We can also apply Eq. (27) to the force (18) which is not continuous at t = 0

and t = T . If we use Eqs. (18) and (20) in Eq. (27) and integrate from ε to T − ε, we have

WR(−∞, ∞) =

(1 − e(t−T )/τ )dt =

(−2ε + T + τ eε−T /τ − τ e−ε/τ ).

(40)

After taking the limit ε → 0, we obtain the result given in Eq. (22).7

We should not apply directly Eq. (27) to the delta function force in Eq. (3) because in

this case the associated acceleration is not continuous at t = 0. In this case we can apply

Eq. (34) with t1 = −∞ to t2 = −ε. The result is

WR(−∞, −ε) =

k2
2m

e−2ε/τ ,

(41)

which represents apparent preradiation. However, we observe that WR in Eq. (41) can

be considered as an eﬀective function of ε. Therefore we can write WR = Weﬀ(ε) =
k2e−2ε/τ /(2m). In the limit ε → 0, we obtain Weﬀ (0) = k2/(2m), that is, Eq. (6). Thus the

energy is radiated at t = 0, the only time at which the delta function force acts and hence

preradiation is also eliminated in this case. Of course, Eq. (27) and more generally Eq. (33)

apply to continuously diﬀerentiable forces.

VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Preaccelerations are commonly ignored by appealing to the argument that for electrons
they occur in times so small (of order τ = 6.24 × 10−24 s) that they would be practically un-

observable. Preaccelerations have also been connected with the point charge model assumed

in the derivation of the AL equation so that the classical electrodynamics of a point charge

seems to be a questionable theory.12 The idea of abandoning the point charge model to avoid

preacceleration has been successfully developed by several authors.12,13 Here we have demon-

strated that for well-behaved external forces acting over ﬁnite times, a preaccelerated point

charge does not have radiative eﬀects, which is consistent with the idea that preacceleration

exists mathematically but not physically. Preradiation is eliminated because the nonrun-

away solutions of the AL equation for well-behaved external forces satisfy ∆TR(±∞) = 0,
where TR = mτ 2a2/2 is the kinetic-radiative energy. The radiative energy is emitted only

in time intervals when the external force acts on the charge.

8 There is another example of an acausal term in electrodynamics. The Coulomb-gauge scalar

potential ΦC and hence its gradient −∇ΦC propagate instantaneously, which violates causal-

ity. However, the second term of the electric ﬁeld E = −∇ΦC − (1/c)∂AC /∂t contains ∇ΦC,

which exactly cancels the acausal term −∇ΦC, so that the ﬁeld E is given by its usual retarded

expression. See, e.g., J. D. Jackson, “From Lorenz to Coulomb and other explicit gauge transfor-

mations,” Am. J. Phys. 70, 917–928 (2002); J. A. Heras, “Comment on ‘Causality, the Coulomb

ﬁeld, and Newton’s law of gravitation,’ F. Rohrlich [Am. J. Phys. 70 411–414 (2002)],” Am. J.

10 The conditions a(±∞) = 0 are suﬃcient to guarantee the vanishing of the change of the Schott

energy (Es = mτ v ·a) during the time interval (−∞, ∞), that is, ∆ES = Es(∞)− Es(−∞) = 0.

See, J. A. Heras and R. F. O’Connell, “Generalization of the Schott energy in electrodynamic

radiation theory,” Am. J. Phys. 74, 150–153 (2006). We note that energy conservation requires

∆ES = 0 to infer the radiative force mτ ˙a. See, J. D. Jackson, Classical Electrodynamics (John

Wiley, New York, 1999), 3rd ed., p. 749. However, Ford and O’Connell have obtained Eq. (2)

without using ∆ES = 0. See, G. W. Ford and R. F. O’Connell, “Radiation reaction in electro-

dynamics and the elimination of runaway solutions,” Phys. Lett. A 157, 217–220 (1991).

11 The condition in the distant future a(∞) = 0 in Eq. (2) ﬁxes the condition in the distant past

a(−∞) = 0 if well-behaved external forces, f (±∞) = 0, are considered. If instead, we consider

these same forces and assume a(−∞) = 0, then the solution of Eq. (2) in the distant future

becomes inﬁnite, a(∞) = ∞. In this sense the physics of the AL equation is consistent with the

idea that the future determines the past. We note also that f (±∞) = 0 and a(±∞) = 0 are

suﬃcient conditions to guarantee the vanishing of the radiation reaction force mτ ˙a at t = ±∞.

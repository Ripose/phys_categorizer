Abstract

The role of extra terms in Newton’s second law that arise as a result of non-Einstein
synchronization is explored. Although such extra terms have been interpreted as pseudo
forces that constrain physical theory to a unique method of synchronization (the Einstein,
or standard, synchronization), a fully relativistic analysis indicates that such extra terms do
not invalidate the conventionalist thesis of synchronization.

1

Introduction

In a recent article Ohanian[1] contends that synchronizations other than the standard Einstein
synchronization (E synchronization) result in pseudo force terms arising in Newton’s second law,
and that because pseudo forces are not observed in inertial frames, non-standard synchroniza-
tions of the Reichenbach[2] type (R sychronizations) can not represent the true state of inertial
frames in the physical world. That is, synchronization is not simply a physically meaningless
gauge to be applied to clock settings, but is constrained by nature to be unique for inertial
frames.

As a counterpoint, one could argue that if clocks in various places have diﬀerent settings,
and one is measuring the motion of a body on which a force is applied, the body will seem to
take a diﬀerent amount of time to get from point A to point B, depending on the settings on the
diﬀerent sets of clocks. One measures acceleration with clocks and rods, and having diﬀerent
sets of clocks means having diﬀerent numerical measurements of acceleration a, for the same
particle motion. So F=ma would not be expected to describe the motion caused by a force F
for any but the standard synchronization, and we would need additional term(s)/factor(s) to
correct for the diﬀerence between F and ma that arises.

If we simply transformed the standard 4D relativistic form of the 2nd law to new synchro-
nization coordinates, and took the low speed limit, we would get the appropriate non-standard
coordinate form of the 2nd law, which would have extra term(s)/factor(s) that could be in-
terpreted as pseudo force(s). We would then have a whole (diﬀerent) set of dynamical laws
that would be consistent internally and in agreement with experiment (provided the same syn-
chronization were used on the experimental clocks.) So does this, or does this not, mean that
R synchronizations are invalid? Does the presence of apparent pseudo forces in the equation
of motion doom the conventionalist interpretation of synchronization? This article addresses

1

these questions, and concludes that the conventionalist thesis is not only still alive, but also still
kicking.

In Section 2, as a reference example of pseudo forces, Coriolis and centrifugal forces in
rotation are derived using relativity theory. The same procedure is then applied in Section
3 to coordinate frames with R synchronization. The results are compared in Section 4 with
Ohanian’s derivation and in Section 5 with various deﬁnitions for “inertial frame”. Philosophical
implications are addressed in Section 6, and conclusions drawn in Section 7.

2 Psuedo Forces Example: Rotation

Pseudo forces in accelerating frames arise (mathematically) from the non-Lorentzian metric.
The following is well known and presented for background, as well as for later comparison to
the non-standard synchronization case.

Repeating the procedure used in rotation to ﬁnd pseudo forces, one ﬁnds, because the metric is
constant in spacetime, that all Christoﬀel symbols (3) are zero, i.e.,

Thus, from (5) we must have

Γα

βγ = 0

for all α,β,γ.

d2 ˜xα
dτ 2 = 0

for all α,

there are no pseudo accelerations, and there can be no pseudo forces, in apparent contradiction
to Ohanian’s claim.

3.2 Proper Time, Applied and Pseudo Forces

However, to be precise, Ohanian claimed only that motion of a non-goedesic (accelerated as seen
in a Lorentz coordinate frame by a force F) would be modiﬁed by additional pseudo forces (as
seen in the R synchronization coordinate frame.) Thus, consider the more general form of the
4D equation (5) when forces are present,

where F α is the 4D generalized covariant force. For the Lorentz coordinate frame, the Christoﬀel
symbols in (14) are zero, and we have

3.3 Coordinate Time, Applied and Pseudo Forces

Note, however, that the time variable in (17) is the proper time on the particle, which, of course,
is invariant, i.e., the same in any coordinate system with any time coordinate synchronization.
One could (and in the present context, should) ask what the equation of motion for a geodesic
would be in terms of the coordinate time ˜t of the R synchronization of (10).

At ﬁrst blush, (25) appears to contain extra terms not found in the more familiar form of the
second law of Newton’s dynamics, and one might be tempted to interpret these terms as pseudo
forces. However, all the unfamiliar terms and factors in (25) are due solely to the relationship
between proper and coordinate standard times being diﬀerent in the E and R systems. The
non-standard expression (19) for proper time in terms of R system clock times lies at the root
of (25). Since proper times are the same in both systems, the diﬀerence is due to the diﬀerence
in coordinate clocks, i.e., to the system of synchronization chosen. The apparent dynamic eﬀect
in (25) is thus not “real”, being based wholly in the deﬁnitions chosen for clock settings.

4 Alternative Synchronization and Newton’s Laws

4.1 Pseudo Forces and Accleration

To gain a feeling for the physical implications of the relation (25), we break that relation into
components of acceleration parallel, and perpendicular, to the direction of alternative synchro-
nization (the k direction.)

4.1.1 Acceleration Parallel to k

For the parallel direction,

(cid:19)
Consider the case where velocity is in the k direction. The equation of motion (26) then becomes

kFk

m˜ak =

Fk,

3

k˜vk
c (cid:19)

(cid:18)

and the unusual factor in parentheses is simply a correction to the acceleration due to the
diﬀerence in clock readings as the object moves in the k direction. That is, the E synchronization
acceleration ak takes on the value of ˜ak in the R synchronization scheme as

ak →

˜ak =

ak =

,

and no actual change in force, i.e. no pseudo force, exists, either in the parallel or transverse
direction.

For the case where velocity is solely (and instantaneously) perpendicular to k, the equation

of motion (26) becomes

m˜ak = Fk,

which is not unusual, and certainly contains no pseudo force. With no non-standard clock
settings in the transverse direction (the direction of the particle velocity), no diﬀerence arises
from the standard form of Newton’s second law.

4.1.2 Acceleration Perpendicular to k

In component form, the vector equation of motion (25) for the direction perpendicular to the R
synchronization is

(cid:18)
For velocity solely in the k direction, this becomes

For velocity solely perpendicular to k, (30) becomes

m˜a⊥ = F⊥ +

˜v⊥,

kFk

(32)

which seems to contain the very unusual (and certainly non-Newtonian) characteristic of having
force in the k direction Fk contribute to acceleration in the direction transverse to k. However,
one has to recognize that the force Fk will accelerate the object in the k direction via (29), thereby
giving it motion in that direction. So, when subsequent measurements of time are taken, which
are used to calculate acceleration ˜a⊥ in the transverse direction, the latter measurements for
time will be on clocks that are further out along the k direction than earlier clocks. In fact, by
substituting (29) into (32), one sees the purely kinematic dependence of ˜a⊥ on ˜ak. And hence, the
settings on the clocks in a non-E synchronization will modify what one would otherwise expect
the measurement of ˜a⊥ to be. Certainly, we would expect this modiﬁcation to be dependent on
the magnitude of the R synchronization k and acceleration ˜ak in the k direction, as is found on
the RH side of (32). Further, ˜a⊥ is measured with meter sticks as well as clocks, and the more
meter sticks the object passes in the transverse direction for a given change in the readings on
the clocks the object passes, the greater the value of ˜a⊥. Thus, we would also expect ˜a⊥ to
depend on velocity ˜v⊥, as it indeed does in (32)[6].

4.2 Clocks, Acceleration, and Pseudo Forces

We have seen there are no real pseudo forces, as the term is usually used, in the R system
equations of motion. Though one might be tempted to conclude that the extra terms/factors
in (25) represent such pseudo forces, we see that a correction in the equation of motion arises
to account for the diﬀerent numbers measured for acceleration with diﬀerent clocks. As the
particle moves in the direction of non-Einstein synchronization, the diﬀerent readings on the
clocks along that direction change our numerical value for acceleration. The correction is found
in the extra terms and factors of (25), and thus, it seems more appropriate to call the function
on the RH of (25) a “synchronization function”, rather than a “force function”. There are no
“true” pseudo forces, as in rotation, but only a clock correction, or “pseudo” pseudo force.

4.3 Observation from the R System

If we merely change the settings on the clocks – similar to merely changing the settings (numbers,
or labels) on the spatial coordinate grid - observers of any process (single particle motion,
collision of particles, etc.), would see no intrinsic visual diﬀerence in behavior. Coordinate
values would change, but not observed behavior. No strange pseudo forces would seem to push
objects in unexpected directions. Colliding billiard balls would look no diﬀerent to our eyes
(unlike in rotation where they would.)

Further, the ﬁrst order length changes calculated[7] for the R system would also not manifest
visually. This is because Lorentz contraction and other length changes, such as that considered
here, are calculated in relativity by assuming the 3D endpoints of a given rod exist at the same
moment in time[8] as seen by a given observer.

Consider a rod moving to the right as seen by both E and R observers. At t = ˜t = 0 the
LH end of the rod is at x = ˜x = 0 For the E observer, the RH end is at x = L for t = 0.
But the RH end according to the R observer (though she sees the same thing visually as the E
observer) when it is at ˜x = L is not at ˜t = 0, but at some earlier time, according to the R clock

7

at ˜x = L. A short time later the RH end will have moved further out along the x axis, and
then the R clock where the RH end is located would read ˜t = 0. Taking the endpoints of the
rod as simultaneous (existing at the same time) means the distance between the LH and RH
ends of the rod according to the R system, at time ˜t = 0, is greater than L. But this diﬀerence
is simply an artifact of arbitrarily setting the R clocks diﬀerently than the E clocks. Physically,
an R observer actually perceives no visual diﬀerence in rod length from the E observer.

If one calculated the times of arrival of light rays from rod endpoints to an E and an R
observer co-existent at the same 4D location, the calculations in the two systems would be
diﬀerent, but the conclusions as to what each would see visually would be the same.

And so it goes with all other ostensible physical diﬀerences between the R and E systems.
They do not manifest as any diﬀerence to physical witnesses (unlike rotation, for example),
but only in the equations to describe phenomena those witnesses would employ, based on their
disparate choices for clock settings.

5

Inertial or Non-inertial Frame?

Ohanian contends that, due to the arising of “pseudo forces”, R synchronization coordinates
constitute non-inertial frames. He does not discredit conventionality of synchronization com-
pletely, but posits that R systems cannot therefore be valid representations of inertial frames.
Indeed, Ohanian says, “.. the R frame is a possible reference frame for describing physics. [But
because] Newton’s laws of dynamics are not valid in their standard form . . . the R frame is not
an inertial frame..”[9]

Yet, one could argue that the most fundamental deﬁnition of a “frame” is a set of continuous
3D points, each of which keeps a constant spatial distance from every other such point. This is
certainly true for the R coordinates. Further, x = ˜x = constant for all points for all time, be it
t or ˜t time. Hence, there is never any motion between the two frames, and they must therefore
be the same frame. They have diﬀerent coordinates, speciﬁcally the time coordinates, but the
frame is the same. This is analogous to a purely spatial coordinate change (such as x
x + 3)
for which the underlying frame stays the same. Thus, if the E system represents an inertial
frame, so must the R system.

→

Additionally, we must draw a distinction between F = ma acting on a particle seen in an
inertial frame, and the force felt by an observer ﬁxed to a frame that is non-inertial. Although
the form of the second law describing particle motion changes in going from E to R, the force
felt by any observer ﬁxed to a given spatial coordinate point stays the same, i.e., zero. If one
feels no force on one’s own body, one is in an inertial frame.

Though, from this logic, the R system and the E system appear to be diﬀerent coordinate
systems, yet constitute the same frame, one’s conclusion in this regard seems to depend on one’s
choice of deﬁnition for inertial frame.

Traditionally, physics employs several heretofore seemingly equivalent ways to deﬁne an
inertial frame. These are listed in Table 1. The third method in the list is not usually found in
texts, though I submit most physicists would agree that it is a valid means. Although the last
column is for a rotating frame, any non-inertial (accelerating or gravitational) frame would do.

Four of the ﬁve criteria directly imply the R system is inertial. This includes the fully
relativistic equation of motion (fourth method), though not what that typically reduces to at
ﬁrst order, i.e., Newton’s second law for inertial frames (ﬁfth method). Thus, though these two
methods have usually been considered more or less equivalent, when R synchronization systems
are considered, they are not. Of the two, most would consider the fully relativistic (4th method)
to be the more fundamental.

The diﬀerence arises in the determination of coordinate standard clock time t from the proper
time on the particle τ . In the R synchronization this has ﬁrst order dependence on the velocity
component in the direction of the non-Einstein clock synchronization. Again, I would argue that
this is merely a coordinate diﬀerence between the R and E systems, and does not imply they
are diﬀerent frames. Thus, by any measure, the R system constitutes an inertial frame.

6 Philosophy, Semantics, and Synchronization

Virtually everyone agrees that the “.. in the R [system] physics is consistent and complete.”[10]
Calculations, based on theory, can be made that predict observed phenomena. Further, everyone

admits that the R system is not as “pretty”, or economical, as the E system. After that, the
arguments seem to drift to the philosophical, even semantic, rather than the scientiﬁc.

For example, if prior well-used, successful, and heretofore interchangeable deﬁnitions of “in-
ertial” seem in conﬂict with one another, contending that one is more correct than another
seems to miss the point. The old deﬁnitions must be re-thought and reﬁned, in the context of
the new knowledge that has arisen.

And whether we consider violation of a long-held sacrosanct deﬁnition, principle, or philo-
sophical position to be enough to “defeat” the conventionalist thesis seems to be largely a matter
of personal predilection. For example, Poincare’ invariance has held prominence for decades as a
seeming inviolate bedrock of natural law. When it, or its Newtonian sibling F=ma, are contro-
verted by a new theory, one can feel a certain historical justiﬁcation in rejecting such a theory
on principle. However, there is no a piori reason, no reason other than past experience with
standard synchronization, upon which to base such a judgment. As it does not appear that the
conventionalists have ever made any claim other than that their thesis is consistent, internally
and with experiment, if we are to invalidate that thesis, then it seems that claim, and that claim
alone, is where we should start.

7 Conclusion

With regard to non-standard Reichenbach synchronization gauges, dynamics is no diﬀerent
from kinematics. Kinematically, we know we are in a non-Einstein synched system because the
measured one-way speed of light is anisotropic. Dynamically, we know because F=ma is not
isotropic (or more precisely, the ﬁrst order relativistic generalization of Newton’s second law
where time is local standard clock time, not proper time on the particle.)

Ohanian’s discrediting of non-standard synchronization is right if we demand that nature’s
symmetry extend beyond the fully covariant tensor form (using proper time) of physical laws
to that of our humanly chosen systems of clocks and rods. Then we must have Einstein syn-
chronization. But that demand seems decidedly artiﬁcial (though more esthetic and simple, to
be sure.) Using tensor notation or generalized coordinates, no new pseudo forces arise. Using
non-standard synchronized clocks, the coordinate equations of motion change form, but that
must be expected. In any case, the R system, as judged from almost any perspective, remains
an inertial frame. And in either the E or R system, provided we use the same clock synchro-
nization for both analysis and test, we will get theoretical predictions that match experiment.
And in the end, that is all we can really ask of physics.

I love symmetry, beauty, and simplicity in my physics, and the conventionalist view of
synchronization, lacking, in my opinion, those qualities, is not something I am particularly
enamored of. I would, in fact, be quite pleased if someone could ﬁnd a way to do away with
it, emphatically and ﬁnally. Thus, I initially welcomed, whole-heartedly, the seeming refutation
of the conventionalist’s thesis by Professor Ohanian, for whom I have long held considerable
admiration. However, upon further reﬂection, I reluctantly concluded that, once again, an
attempt to invalidate the theory of gauge synchronization seems to have come up short.

[6] One might wonder why we seem to ignore subsequent time measurements in (29) in the k
direction, but not in (32). The reason is that in the former case, though ˜ak would be modiﬁed
by later velocity changes in the k direction, the instantaneous velocity in the k direction is
zero. In the latter case, ˜a⊥ is modiﬁed instantaneously by an acceleration in the k direction,
which is instantaneously non-zero.

[8] It is straightforward to show, in Lorentzian relativity theory, that if the 3D endpoints of a
rod are simultaneous (exist at the same time) as seen in two diﬀerent systems, then there is
no diﬀerence in length (no Lorentz contraction) for the rod between the two systems. Lorentz
contraction is intimately related to diﬀerences in simultaneity (and thus to synchronization).

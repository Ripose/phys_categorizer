Abstract

The dynamics of charged particle beams interacting with laser beams and material targets in storage
rings is presented. Formulas for the radiative damping, quantum excitation and equilibrium parameters
of ion and electron beams determined by the backward rayleigh and backward compton scattering are
derived. General case is considered. It takes into account the possibility of the periodical displacement
of the laser beam in the radial direction with varying velocity in the process of the interaction of the
beams and includes the possibility of the description of dynamics of muon beams interacting with
material targets in storage rings (enhanced ionization cooling). The example is considered and some
applications of being cooled beams are discussed.

Introduction

The backward compton or rayleigh scattering of laser photons by elementary or complicated particles
(electrons, protons, ions) in storage rings results simultaneously both to radiative damping and to quan-
tum excitation of amplitudes of betatron and phase oscillations of these particles. There is an analogy
of these processes with the inﬂuence of synchrotron radiation on dynamics of particles in storage rings.
The spectral-angular characteristics of radiation scattered by an ion and electron beams are identical.
Therefore the equilibrium transverse emittances and damping times of amplitudes of betatron and phase
oscillations of particle beams as a function of parameters of the storage ring, charge and mass of particles
are identical. However there is a diﬀerence in the coeﬃcients of proportionality of the longitudinal emit-
tances. In the relativistic case the maximal hardness of scattered radiation according to the relativistic
doppler eﬀect is 4γ2 times higher then the hardness of the laser radiation, where γ = 1/
β2 is a
relativistic factor of a particle; β = v/c, relative velocity of particles. Therefore the hardness of the non-
resonance radiation scattered by an electron is proportional to 4γ2. At the same time ions are resonant
systems. They are excited by photons of a laser beam, and rescatter them later. The nonmonochromatic
laser beam is used in order to ions of diﬀerent energies scattered laser photons independently on their
energy. In this case the energy of laser photons interacting with ions at resonance is inversely proportional
to 2γ. Therefore the hardness of radiation scattered by these ions is proportional to 2γ. The diﬀerence
in the dependence of hardness of radiation scattered by electron and ion beams on their energy leads
to the diﬀerence 2 times in the expressions for equilibrium energy spreads, longitudinal and transverse
radial-phase dimensions of ion and electron beams1.

the laser beams in storage rings are presented. General formulas are received for the non-stationary
case, when the laser beam is displaced with some velocity in the radial direction relative to the beam of
particles and such a way the degree of overlapping of beams is changed. The calculations are carried out
in the assumption, that the displacement of the vertical position of the exited ions for their life-time can
be neglected. The received results include the possibility of the description of muon beam dynamics when
material targets are used in storage rings (ionization cooling). The example is considered to estimate
the possible range of energies of electron storage rings and hardness of laser and scattered radiation
proceeding from necessary life-time of the electron beam in the storage ring. Some applications of the
being cooled beams are discussed.

The parameters of the particle beams for stationary conditions of interaction of laser and particle
beams were derived in papers [1, 2] for ion beams and in the paper [3] for electron beams. Dynamic
conditions of interaction were investigated for the case of switched oﬀ the radiofrequency system of the
storage ring in the paper [4].

2 Radiative eﬀects in laser-electron and laser-ion storage rings in sta-

tionary conditions

Below we will present in the general form a derivation of basic equations describing the dynamics of
interaction of particles with a laser beam in storage rings and then we will discuss the losses of particles
caused by multiple scattering of the laser beam photons and intrabeam scattering. The maximal stored
current limited by coulomb repulsion of particles in the beam will be discussed as well.

2.1 The equilibrium vertical dimension of a particle beam

direction is described by the equation

quantum nature of the interaction of particles with the laser beam.

At the moment of a photon scattering the coordinate of the particle is not changed (δz = 0). If a
photon is emitted in a direction of a particle velocity, then the momentum and inclination angle of the
particle trajectory is not changed as well (δz
= 0). Therefore in the case of vertical oscillations the
particle emission of a photon leads to a change of its trajectory only in the case, when the photon is
emitted under some angle to its velocity.

and the displacement of the ion vertical position can be neglected. At the derivation of (8) we took into
account that at the averaging the ﬁrst term in (4) tends to zero.

Within the framework of the classical electrodynamics the electromagnetic radiation is emitted in the
direction of the velocity of a particle and it is not accompanied by a radiative damping of amplitudes of
vertical betatron of oscillations. The damping arises at the acceleration of particles in the high-frequency
resonator. In this case particle changes longitudinal component of momentum only, and consequently

2.2 The equilibrium radial dimension of a beam determined by betatron oscillations

The radial coordinate of a particle in a storage ring is x = xη + xb, where xη is the deviation of an
instantaneous orbit of this particle from equilibrium orbit and xb, the deviation of the particle from
the instantaneous orbit. The instantaneous orbit makes slow radial-phase oscillations relative to the
equilibrium orbit, and the particle makes fast betatron oscillation relative to the instantaneous orbit.

The expression for the deviation of a particle from the instantaneous orbit in the horizontal plane
of the storage ring has the form identical to the form for the vertical oscillations. It can be obtained
by replacing z by xb in (1) - (3). Unlike vertical, the radial betatron oscillations are connected with
radial-phase oscillations. The position of the instantaneous orbit of a particle is changed intermittently
after scattering of a laser photon by the value

of oscillations will be changed intermittently as well. At that the inclination of the particle trajectory
will not be changed.

scattering point under the condition that at this point β

2.8 Example

±

In the Tables 1 - 3, as an example, the basic parameters of the electron storage ring, the electron and laser
beam parameters and the parameters of the beam of scattered radiation are presented. It is supposed,
that the interaction of the electron and circular polarized laser beams occurs in the straight section of
the storage ring having zero dispersion function and small β-function (βx,z/,sc = 1 sm). Outside of the
R/νx,z = 10 cm, Dx = R/ν2 = 1cm. The storage ring has large energy
region of interaction βx,z(s)
acceptance (∆ε)A/εs =

0.1. One electron bunch regime is used.

≃

From the tables we can see, that in the conditions of small currents horizontal emittance and the
horizontal dimensions of the electron beam determined by the synchrotron radiation (the laser is switched
oﬀ) are much greater then the corresponding dimensions determined by backward compton scattering, if
the interaction of the electron and laser beams occurs in the region with zero dispersion function. The
vertical dimension of the beam determined by the synchrotron radiation is much less then the horizontal
one. The vertical and horizontal dimensions of the beam determined by backward compton scattering
R/ν2 leads to
are identical. The increase of the dispersion function of the storage ring to the value Dx ≃
the increase of the horizontal dimension of the beam by the backward compton scattering approximately
γs = 102 times.

The conditions of small currents in this example correspond to the currents

0.1 mA. At the current
100 mA we are forced to increase the dimensions of a beam artiﬁcially so that outside of the regions of

caused by intrabeam scattering of electrons (Touschek eﬀect) reaches the acceptable values τ T

that is close to the extremely possible shift3. The increase of the horizontal dimension of a beam can

be achieved by a selection of a ﬁnal value of the dispersion function at the interaction point (IP) or by
excitation of betatron and phase oscillations of particles of the beam by a high-frequency ﬁelds. The
vertical dimension of a beam can be increased by coupling of vertical and horizontal oscillations. Besides
the coulomb repulsion the intrabeam scattering of the electrons leads to the increase of the transverse
dimensions of the beam in this case [7].

The equilibrium energy spread of a beam of particles does not depend on the focusing properties and
parameters of the radio-frequency system of the storage ring. It grows with the increase of the energy,
γs/λL) and at the energy 50 MeV has rather large
decreases with increase of the laser wavelength (
10−2), and leads to hard requirements to the energy acceptance of the storage ring,
value (σε/εs = 1.3
p
and, hence, to the focusing forces. In this example we have limited the acceptance of the storage ring
0.14. Therefore with increase of the energy of particles in the storage rings
by the value (∆ε)A/εs =
it is necessary to go to the more long wavelength lasers. At the energy of particles 1 , λL = 20 µm the
maximal energy of scattered photons is increased from εγ m = ¯hωm = 50 keV up to εγ m = 1.0 MeV, and
the energy spread of the beam of particles is not changed (

1.3%).

±

∼

·

The limiting currents in the storage ring are increased proportionally to the cube of the energy and
in the inverse proportion to the electron beam crossection in the storage ring. Therefore the increasing
of the energy of the storage ring will permit to reduce the dimensions of the beams and to increase
the stored current. The transverse dimensions of the laser beam must be greater then the transverse
dimensions of the electron beam (in the considered example σL = 50 µm, σx,z = 23.7 µm in the region of
interaction). The decreasing of the electron beam current up to 10 mA and the appropriate decreasing of
the transverse dimensions of the electron and laser beams the power of scattered radiation is not changed,
and the brightness is increased.

The basic advantage of the storage rings compared with the linear accelerators as the sources of the
hard electromagnetic radiation consists in the fact that the scattering of the laser photons by electrons
do not lead to losses of these electrons, and the electrons are used repeatedly. In the considered case the
losses of electrons are determined by the multiple processes of scattering in the ﬁeld of the laser beam

and by Touschek eﬀect. For the life-time τ T

and lose the energy ∆εloss = eVsNef f ≃
life-time of the beam can be decreased, and the frequency of the injection of electrons can be increased.
Thus the requirements to vacuum in the storage ring and to the value of the energy acceptance can be
reduced.

The energy of the electron is changed by the value εγ ≪
It is interesting to note, that in the considered case the average value of the jump of the electron
energy caused by scattering a photon is much greater then the increase of the energy of the equilibrium

In the considered storage ring, as well as in the similar storage ring discussed in [3], the harmonic
order of the radio-frequency generator is chosen equal to h = 60. It corresponds to the wavelength of the
10.5 cm. Such harmonic order is convenient at the construction of the small-dimensional
generator λrf ≃

voltage and the quality of the resonator. So at the harmonic order h = 4 (λrf = 1.57 m) the amplitude of

the voltage at the gap of the resonator will be decreased to the value Vm = 16.7 kV, and the dimension of
0.073). At that the equilibrium transverse dimensions
the separatrix will not be changed ((∆ε)sep/εs ≃
of the beam will not be changed, and the longitudinal dimension will be increased up to acceptable
dimension σbcs
l = 7.4 mm < lR. The equilibrium voltage in this case remains much smaller then the
amplitude of radio-frequency voltage. The analogical remark can be done relatively to the focusing force.
It is important to have the zero dispersion function and low β-function in the straight section of the
storage ring. Less important is to have very high tunes.

The use of supermirrors and storage rings with straight sections having zero dispersion function
allows to lower the beam dimensions and to increase the power of the laser radiation in the resonator
up to the values, when the losses of the energy of the electron in the storage ring through the backward
compton scattering of the laser photons become much greater than the losses of the energy through
the synchrotron radiation. Thus the radiative damping times of the amplitudes of radial and phase
oscillations are decreased essentially. It allows to lower the inﬂuence of the intrabeam scattering inside
the electron beam and the inﬂuence of the emission of hard backward scattered laser photons on the
excitation of betatron and phase oscillations.

2.9 Some applications of the backward compton and backward rayleigh sources of

hard electromagnetic radiation

For the ﬁrst time the sources of the backward compton scattering were discussed in the papers [15], [16].
Coherent scattering of electromagnetic waves by electron beams was considered. Later the incoherent
scattering of photons of a laser beam by ultrarelativistic electrons was considered in the papers [17],
[18] and realized in papers [19] (nonrelativistic beams) and [20], [21] (relativistic beams). The scattered
γ-quanta were used in the ﬁelds of nuclear physics and diagnostics of electron beams.

Later the production of circular polarized backward compton γ-quanta and using them in the con-
version systems for the production of the longitudinally polarized positron beams and in nuclear physics
was discussed in papers [22] - [27]6 In the paper [28] the intraresonator scheme of interaction of electron
and laser beams was considered. This scheme was realized later in papers [29], [30] (in the regime of the
free-electron laser). In the paper [31] the current 0.5 was stored in the storage ring NIJI-1 SR (maximum
energy 270 MeV) at the energy 163 MeV. This and similar papers stimulated the interest to investigations
of compact storage rings as the sources of x-ray radiation for medical and other applications [32]. In the
paper [33] the use of supermirrors was suggested to increase the power of the scattered radiation.

In papers [34] - [37] the attention was paid to the rayleigh scattering sources. In this case the scattering

crossection of a photon by bound electron in ion at resonance is many orders (
compton one and hence the power of scattered radiation is higher.

In the papers [1], [2], it was shown that the scattering of laser photons by ions in the storage rings
leads to the three-dimensional radiative cooling of ion beams and, simultaneously, to the excitation of
the amplitudes of betatron and phase oscillations of ions in the beam. The equilibrium parameters of
ion beams according to developed theory will diﬀer from similar parameters of beams determined by the
synchrotron radiation. To reduce the inﬂuence of the quantum excitation of amplitudes of betatron and
radial-phase oscillations it was suggested to use the zero dispersion function at the IP7.

In the paper [3] it was shown, that the use of radiative damping in electron storage rings of the
intermediate energy, supermirrors and modern lasers allows to generate the beams of scattered photons
with the power exceeding the power of the synchrotron radiation from the orbit of these storage rings
at higher hardness and brightness. At that the damping time of amplitudes of electron oscillations is
decreased, the inﬂuence of the intrabeam scattering on the emittance of the beam is decreased. This paper
stimulated a series of papers devoted to sources of backward compton scattering and their applications
[38] - [40], [4]. In papers [41] - [43] the attention was paid on the opportunity of eﬀective self-polarization
of the positron beams in the storage rings with special magnetic structure in the ﬁeld of the circular
polarized laser beam.

3 Radiative eﬀects in laser-electron and laser-ion storage rings in dy-

namics

In the previous section we have considered the dynamics of particles in storage rings in the ﬁeld of a
homogeneous counterpropagated laser beam in stationary regime. In this case the transverse dimensions
of the laser beam were greater, than the dimensions of the particle beam and their axes coincided. At the
same time we have derived the general formulas (23), (28) allowing to consider the dynamics of particle
beams interacting with an arbitrary targets (undulators, laser beams, material media). The targets could
be non-uniform and could be moved (oscillate) in the radial direction (or, the orbits in the storage rings
could be moved in the backward direction). These formulas are

the deviation of the particle from the equilibrium orbit. The deviation xη is determined by the deviation
of the relative energy γ from the equilibrium one and by the dispersion function . For the stationary

In the case of cooling of the electron and ion beams in the ﬁeld of the laser beam the second term
in (49) is equal ∂ ln F2/∂ ln γ = ki. In a case of ionization cooling of muon beams this term is much less
then unit and has more complicated dependence on energy.

7The using of damping wigglers and undulators in storage rings, installed in the straight sections, with zero dispersion
function has allowed to reduce the emittances of electron beams (three orders) [7] and to proceed to light sources of the
third generation.

of muon beams, wedge target is used).

According to (50), (51) the increase of damping decrement of amplitudes of betatron oscillations of
particles leads to the decrease of the damping decrement of amplitudes of phase oscillations in the same
degree. The sum of decrements is a constant (analogue of the Robinson criterion of damping). The
decrements can accept negative values.

The non-stationary regime of interaction of being cooled particle beams with targets was developed in
[4] for the case of the unbunched beams. Switching on a radio-frequency accelerating ﬁeld will complicate
the problem. This problem will be considered in the separate paper.

4 Conclusion

In this paper the detailed derivation of the equations describing the dynamics and equilibrium dimensions
of the particle beams interacting with the laser beams in storage rings is presented. Brief derivation of
these equations was given in the papers [1, 2] for ion beams and in the paper [3] for the electron beams8.
The general non-stationary case of interaction of particles with a target is considered. The example is
presented to illustrate the problem to estimate the possible range of the energy of electron storage rings
and the hardness of scattered radiation proceeding from life-time of the electron beam in the ring. Some
applications of the being cooled beams were discussed.

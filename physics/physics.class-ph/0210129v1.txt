Abstract
By numerical calculation, the Planck spectrum with zero-point radiation is shown to satisfy a
natural maximum-entropy principle whereas alternative choices of spectra do not. Speciﬁcally, if
we consider a set of conducting-walled boxes, each with a partition placed at a diﬀerent location
in the box, so that across the collection of boxes the partitions are uniformly spaced across the
volume, then the Planck spectrum corresponds to that spectrum of random radiation (having
constant energy kBT per normal mode at low frequencies and zero-point energy (1/2)hω per
normal mode at high frequencies) which gives maximum uniformity across the collection of boxes
for the radiation energy per box. Our analysis involves Casimir energies and zero-point radiation
which do not usually appear in thermodynamic analyses. For simplicity, the analysis is presented
for waves in one space dimension.

INTRODUCTION

A thermodynamic system described by a known Lagrangian has well-deﬁned restrictions
on its adiabatic curves following from the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. However, the
mechanical Lagrangian does not give the full thermodynamic behavior because it does not
determine the thermodynamic entropy. Rather, some additional idea of order, of uniformity,
is required for the determination of the entropy function. The assumptions of statistical
mechanics regarding equally-probable units provide the idea of uniformity needed to derive
the entropy function. Sometimes the idea of uniformity is regarded as immediately evident
or natural. For example, in the classical statistical mechanics of particles in a box, it is
natural to assume that the situation of maximum uniformity, maximum entropy, corresponds
In this article, we propose that
to a uniform spatial distribution for particles in the box.
there is a similar natural choice for maximum entropy for blackbody radiation in connection
with Casimir energies and zero-point radiation; this natural choice leads to the Planck
spectrum.

Blackbody radiation is a fundamental thermodynamics system which holds a special place
in the history of physics as the beginning point of quantum theory.[1] In the nineteenth cen-
tury, Boltzmann used Maxwell’s connection between radiation pressure and energy density,
together with the assumption that the energy density depended upon temperature alone,
to derive Stefan’s law connecting total energy density and temperature.[2] Wien used adi-
abatic compression and Maxwell’s theory to obtain the displacement law corresponding to
the condition on the adiabatic curves for a harmonic oscillator thermodynamic system.[3]
However, determination of the full blackbody radiation spectrum seemed to confound clas-
sical analysis because no natural entropy analysis seemed possible. Today, the blackbody
spectrum is regarded as comprehensible only in terms of energy quanta which are outside of
classical theory.

However, in connection with random radiation, twentieth century physics contributed
two important ideas, zero-point energy and Casimir forces, which raise new possibilities for
recognizing a natural entropy function for thermal radiation. Zero-point energy is random
energy which is present even at zero temperature.[4] Thermodynamics allows the possibility
of zero-point energy and experimental evidence such as van der Waals forces requires its
existence.[5] Casimir forces and energies are those which arise due to the discrete, classical
normal modes structure of a system.[6] In total contrast to particles, waves are inﬂuenced
in the interior of a volume by the presence of boundary conditions at the walls. Thus if a
thin conducting partition is introduced into a conducting-walled box, then the energy of the
system is changed due to the new boundary conditions at the conducting partition.

Casimir energies serve to couple total electromagnetic radiation energy to the speciﬁc
spectrum of random radiation. Thus if we consider a collection of conducting-walled con-
tainers, each with a partition at a diﬀerent location, and each box having random radiation
at the same temperature, then each of these boxes will have a diﬀerent (average) thermal
energy. And diﬀerent assumed spectral distributions for thermal radiation will lead to
diﬀerent distributions of energies among the partitioned boxes. Now maximum entropy
naturally suggests uniformity.
It seems natural to suggest that maximum entropy corre-
sponds to the least variation of energy among the partitioned boxes. We will ﬁnd that, in
the presence of zero-point radiation to prevent an ”ultra-violet catastrophe,” this natural
entropy idea leads to the Planck spectrum for thermal radiation.

II. THERMODYNAMICS OF WAVES IN A ONE-DIMENSIONAL BOX

Although the calculations to be described below can be carried through for electromag-
netic waves in a three-dimensional box, we will consider a thermodynamic wave system in
one spatial dimension rather than in three because the mathematics is distinctly simpler
while the physical ideas are unchanged.[7] Thus we can imagine one-dimensional thermo-
dynamic wave systems consisting of waves on a string, or of electromagnetic waves which
are required to move between two conducting walls with wave vectors k which are always
perpendicular to the walls.

Systems satisfying the wave equation in a container with conducting walls can be de-
scribed in terms of normal modes of oscillation, each of which corresponds to a harmonic
oscillator system[8] with Lagrangian

L(qλ, ˙qλ) = Σλ(1/2)( ˙q2

λ − ω2

nq2
λ)

where the qλ are the amplitudes of the normal modes. For waves in one spatial dimension
inside a box of length L, the normal modes can be labeled by a single integer index n where
the associated frequency ωn is given by ωn = cnπ/L, n = 1, 2, 3..., where c is the speed
of the waves. Wien’s displacement law, which follows from the application of the laws of
thermodynamics to a harmonic oscillator system, tells us that the energy U of a normal
mode at frequency ω and temperature T is given by

U(ω, T ) = −ωφ′(ω/T )

where φ′ is a function of the single variable ω/T .[9]

Wien’s displacement law allows two limits which make the energy U independent of one
of its variables. Thus if φ′ → const when ω/T >> 1, then U depends upon ω alone. This
corresponds to temperature-independent zero-point radiation

U → U zp(ω) = (1/2)~ω for ω/T >> 1

where the constant ~ must be chosen to have the value of Planck’s constant in order to ﬁt
with van der Waals forces. On the other hand, if φ′ → const/(ω/T ), when ω/T << 1, then
U depends upon T alone. This corresponds to the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum

U → U RJ (ω) = kBT for ω/T << 1

which holds at low frequencies with kB as Boltzmann’s constant.

Since we are not interested in numerical calculations of thermodynamic quantities, we
will use natural units[10] where ~ = 1 so that frequency is measured in energy units, and
kB = 1 so that temperature is measured in energy units and entropy is a pure number,

Uzp(ω) = (1/2)ω and

URJ (ω) = T

It is convenient to introduce the thermal energy UT (ω, T ) of a mode of frequency ω as

the mode energy above the zero-point energy

UT (ω, T ) = U(ω, T ) − Uzp(ω)

Although the total energy U is related to forces, only the thermal energy UT inﬂuences the
entropy.[11]

The total thermal radiation energy UT in a box of length L is given by the sum over the
thermal energies UT of the modes of frequencies ωn = nπc/L for integer n. We consider
only the thermal energy UT since thermodynamics requires that UT is a ﬁnite quantity when
summed over all normal modes. In contrast, use of the modes’ total energies U or zero-point
energies Uzp will give a divergence in the sum over (inﬁnitely many) high-frequency modes.
In a one-dimensional box which is so large that the discrete sum over normal modes can be
replaced by an integral, we can use (2) to obtain the total thermal energy UT (L, T ) in the
form

UT (L, T ) = Σ∞

for one space dimension. This is just the Stefan-Boltzmann result appropriate for one space
dimension.[12] In the case of waves in three spatial dimensions, the frequencies of the normal
modes ωlmn would be labeled by three integer indices and the same procedure would lead to
a T 4 temperature dependence for a large container.

III. NORMAL MODE STRUCTURE AND CASIMIR FORCES

The Stefan-Boltzmann law in (7) gives the temperature dependence of the total thermal
energy but provides no information regarding the spectrum of thermal radiation. Now in
obtaining Eq.(7), we took the limit of a large box L and so replaced the sum over normal
modes by an integral. However, by going to the continuum limit, we lost the information
It was Casimir
which might be available in the discrete spectrum of the normal modes.
who saw the possibility of new forces and energies linked to this discreteness of the classical
normal mode structure. The most famous example of such forces is the original Casimir
calculation[6] of the force between conducting parallel plates arising from electromagnetic
zero-point radiation. Casimir worked speciﬁcally with zero-point ﬁelds; however, the idea
is not limited to zero-point radiation. Any spectrum of random classical radiation will
lead to Casimir energies associated with the discrete classical normal mode structure of a
container.[13] Indeed, every thermodynamic variable (energy, entropy, free energy, force)
will depend upon the normal modes structure.

It should be emphasized how totally diﬀerent this classical wave situation is from the
classical particle situation of ideal gas particles in a box. Thus if a box with reﬂecting walls
is ﬁlled with ideal gas particles at temperature T , then the introduction of a thin reﬂecting
partition does not change the system energy and does not involved any average force on the
partition. In total contrast, the introduction of a conducting partition into a conducting-
walled box of thermal radiation leads to a change in the normal mode structure and hence
both to position-dependent energy changes (Casimir energies) and to average forces on the
partition (Casimir forces). These Casimir energies and forces will depend upon the precise
spectrum of random radiation and upon the precise location of the partition. In this article
we note that the Planck spectrum for thermal radiation equilibrium can be obtained from
a natural maximum-entropy principle for the Casimir energy changes associated with the
placement of partitions in boxes of radiation.

IV. CHANGE IN CASIMIR ENERGY DUE TO A PARTITION

We now consider a one-dimensional box of length L and calculate the change of radiation
energy ∆U(x, L, T ) with position x for a partition which is located a distance x from the
left-hand end of the box, 0 ≤ x ≤ L. The energy of each normal mode of frequency ωn is
given by U(ωn, T ). The partition changes the normal mode frequencies and so produces a
position-dependent energy change ∆U(x, L, T ) which is a Casimir energy. We will calculate
the Casimir energy ∆U(x, L, T ) as the change in the system energy when the partition is
placed a distance x from the left-hand wall compared to when the partition is placed at
x = L/2 in the middle of the box,

∆U(x, L, T ) = {U(x, T ) + U(L − x), T } − {U(L/2, T ) + U(L/2, T )}

V. CASIMIR ENERGY FOR THE ZERO-POINT SPECTRUM

Equation (8) for the Casimir energy ∆U(x, L, T ) of a box has been expressed as a sum over
the total energy of each normal mode. Before we can discuss a maximum entropy principle
involving this energy, we must know that it is well-deﬁned. We have already noted that the
sum over the thermal energy UT (ω, T ) of the modes represents the total thermal energy UT
and is ﬁnite, while the sum including the zero-point energy Uzp(ω) is divergent. However,
the Casimir energy ∆U(x, L, T ) in (8) can be deﬁned as a limit and is ﬁnite. We recall that,
in contrast to an ideal system, any physical wave system (such as a string with clamped
ends or else electromagnetic ﬁelds in a region bounded by good conductors) will not enforce
the normal mode structure at very high frequencies (short wavelengths). Thus it is natural
to introduce a smooth cut-oﬀ exp(−Λω/c) related to frequency ω = ck

U(L, T, Λ) = Σ∞

n=1U(ωn, T ) exp(−Λωn/c)

(9)

Next we carry out the subtractions corresponding to (8) to obtain the Casimir energy,
∆U(x, L, T, Λ), and then allow the no-cut-oﬀ limit Λ → 0. Although here we will work
with an exponential cut-oﬀ because it is easy to sum the geometric series, the result is
very general; any smooth cut-oﬀ function dependent on frequency alone will give the same
result[14].

In this fashion, we can calculate the Casimir energy for the zero-point radiation spectrum

in (5),

The total Casimir energy at ﬁnite temperature T then involves

∆U(x, L, T ) = ∆UT (x, L, T ) + ∆Uzp(x, L)

where ∆U, ∆UT , ∆Uzp are formed from the respective mode energies U, UT , and Uzp. From
the result (11) for zero-point energy, we see that ∆U(x, L, T ) is ﬁnite for any spectrum UT
of thermal radiation which has ﬁnite total energy UT .

VI. MAXIMUM ENTROPY PRINCIPLE FOR THERMAL RADIATION

Suppose now that we consider a collection of conducting-walled boxes of length L which
diﬀer only in the placement of the partition. Our ideas of uniformity suggest that the
collection should have the partitions distributed uniformly in x along the open interval
(0, L).
If each of these boxes contained thermal radiation at the same temperature T ,
then they would still diﬀer in their total energies because of the presence of the partitions
at diﬀerent locations and the associated diﬀerence in Casimir energies. We notice how
strikingly diﬀerent this is from the situation which is usually described in thermodynamics
texts where we are dealing with ideal gas particles in a box. For ideal gas particles in a
box, the insertion of a thin partition into the equilibrium situation would not change the
total energy or the entropy for the box; each box would have the same energy. Yet in
our situation of thermal radiation, the boxes each have the same temperature yet each has
a diﬀerent energy. The natural situation of maximum entropy corresponds to maximum
uniformity of energy among the boxes.

In order to turn this natural-maximum-entropy idea into a numerical criterion, we must
turn back to Wien’s displacement theorem to note the allowed functional form for UT (ω, T )
and to ﬁx the connection between the possible radiation spectra and temperature. We have
already indicated that the thermodynamics associated with the Wien displacement theorem
gives thermal radiation U → U RJ (ω) = T
ω/T << 1. Thus the temperature of
the random radiation ﬁxes the low-frequency limit of UT (ω, T ). Furthermore, the thermal
energy of each normal mode must be non-negative UT (ω, T ) (cid:23) 0, and the total thermal
energy must be ﬁnite. These criteria can be met by any distribution of normal mode
thermal energies

If we calculate the Casimir energy ∆U(x, L, T ) in (8) using (11) and (12) with any function
f satisfying the criteria of (14), then the departure I from a uniform energy among the

6

partitioned boxes is given by

I =

|∆U(xi, L, T )|

Xi

(15)

where the sum is over the uniformly-distributed partition locations xi. Since the Casimir
energy vanishes for the partition at x = L/2 and is symmetric about this point, this sum
allows an immediate conversion to an equivalent integral

x=L/2

I =

Z

x=δ

dx |∆U(x, L, T )|

(16)

where δ is a small cut-oﬀ distance which is much less than any other length in the situation,
0 < δ << min(L, c/T ). The need for such a cut-oﬀ arises because of the divergence of
the zero-point Casimir energy at small distances. The natural maximum-entropy principle
states that nature will choose the function f (x) satisfying the criteria in (14) which makes
the integral I in(16) a minimum.[15]

VII. CASIMIR ENERGIES FOR VARIOUS RADIATION SPECTRA

In one spatial dimension, it is quick to evaluate the Casimir energies for various monotonic
spectral functions U(ω, T ) on a home computer. One separates out the divergent zero-point
energy contribution corresponding to (11) and then evaluates the thermal contribution to
the Casimir energy for any assumed thermal spectrum UT (ω, T ) = T f (ω/T ) meeting the
criteria of (14). The total Casimir energy ∆U(x, L, T ) is the sum of the thermal and
zero-point contributions.

For all spectra UT (ω, T ) satisfying the required conditions (14), we can calculate the test
integral given in Eq.(16). The spectrum providing the smallest value for the integral appears
to be the Planck spectrum with zero-point radiation

Indeed, we may use the Planck form (or other functional forms) in a variational calculation
to obtain the parameters which give the smallest value to the test integral for the given
functional form. Thus the Planck form for the thermal part of the radiation at frequency ω
can be written as

UP T (ω, T ) = UP (ω, T ) −

ω =

1
2

ω
exp(ω/T ) − 1

We can introduce parameters C1 and C2 into a generalization of this form giving an energy
spectrum including zero-point energy as

(17)

(18)

(19)

UC1C2(ω, T ) =

C1ω exp[−C2(ω/T )]
1 − exp[−C1(ω/T )]

+ (1/2)ω

For all positive parameters C1 and C2, this spectrum goes over to energy equipartition in
the limit ω → 0 and goes over to zero-point energy at high frequency while giving ﬁnite total
thermal radiation energy. Accordingly we can search for the the values of C1 and C2 which
make the test integral (16) a minimum. Numerical calculation shows that the minimum

7

value for the test integral is achieved when C1 = C2 = 1, corresponding to exactly the
Planck spectrum (17).

Indeed, of all the functional forms tested numerically, the Planck spectrum gave the
smallest value of the test integral. We conjecture that analytic calculation[16] would show
that this spectrum provides the minimum for this integral, and hence in this sense provides
the smallest Casimir energies and greatest uniformity in the presence of zero-point radiation.

VIII. CASIMIR ENERGY FOR THE RAYLEIGH-JEANS SPECTRUM

In the current textbook accounts of blackbody radiation, zero-point radiation is not
considered, and the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum is said to be the spectrum predicted by classical
physics.
It therefore seems of interest to calculate the Casimir energies associated with
the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum in (5). This spectrum is simple enough to allow analytic
calculation of the Casimir energies. We again make use of a high frequency cut-oﬀ just as
in the case of the zero-point spectrum, and calculate

Thus we ﬁnd that the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum gives no Casimir energy changes at all.
Indeed, the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum is the unique spectrum which produces no Casimir
energy changes associated with the placement of the Casimir partition, ∆URJ (x, L, T ) =
0.[17]

IX.

’ULTRA-VIOLET CATASTROPHE’ WITHOUT ZERO-POINT RADIATION

We should emphasize that our maximum entropy principle indeed requires the presence
of the zero-point radiation energy.
If no zero-point energy were present, then we would
still require that the thermal spectrum give energy equipartition at low frequency and go
to zero at high frequency so as to give a ﬁnite energy density for thermal radiation. For
this case, the thermal energy would be the total energy used in (16). However, there would
be no natural high-frequency limit. If we tried a smooth spectrum such as that suggested
by Rayleigh URT (ω, T ) = T exp[−C(ω/T )] with an adjustable parameter C but without
zero-point energy, then we would ﬁnd that the test integral given in Eq.(16) decreases as the
parameter C decreases, bringing the spectrum ever closer to the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum,
in which limit the integral vanishes I = 0 and there are no Casimir energy changes. The
absence of any natural cut-oﬀ frequency represents behavior reminiscent of the ”ultraviolet

8

catastrophe” emphasized by Einstein and named by Ehrenfest in 1911. What prevents the
catastrophic shift of thermal radiation to ever-higher frequencies is precisely the presence of
zero-point radiation.

X. CONCLUDING SUMMARY

In this analysis, we have treated the thermodynamics of waves in one spatial dimension.
However, the ideas can be carried over to electromagnetic waves in three spatial dimen-
sions. Although the Wien displacement theorem reﬂects the information from adiabatic
energy changes of the known harmonic oscillator Lagrangian for the electromagnetic modes
of thermal radiation, the entropy associated with each mode is undetermined. Traditional
classical physics does not ﬁnd it possible to recognize a situation of natural maximum uni-
formity, of maximum entropy. However, the use of Casimir energies, which connect diﬀerent
radiation spectra to diﬀerent total radiation energies in a partitioned box, allows one to

In the presence of zero-point
radiation, numerical calculation indicates that the spectrum of maximum entropy is the
Planck spectrum.

tistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics (Oxford, New York 1995), p. 128. See the references
in 3.

[10] See the discussion of natural units by C. Garrod, reference 9, p. 120. The choice ~ = 1 is
familiar to particle physicists. The measurement of temperature in energy units is familiar in
thermodynamics where our choice corresponds to the use of what is usually termed τ instead
of T .

[11] See, for example, Boyer in reference 3.
[12] It is amusing to carry out Boltzmann’s derivation for the one-dimensional case. We assume
that the thermal energy and entropy of our waves in a very large one-dimensional box of
length L satisfy UT (T, L) = L uT (T ), and S(T, L) = L s(T ) where the densities are functions
of temperature alone. For a normally incident plane wave, we expect a pressure p = E/V rather
than p = (1/3)E/V . Multiplying by the area of the walls, the force on the bounding partition
corresponds to X = u where u is the energy per unit length. These are electromagnetic results
which involve no thermodynamics. Now substituting into T dS(T, L) = dUT (T, L) + XT dL
and separating diﬀerentials on both sides, we have s = 2uT /T and ds/dT = (1/T )(duT /dT ).
Diﬀerentiating the equation for s with respect to temperature and substituting into the second,
we ﬁnd a diﬀerential equation with solution uT = αT 2 and so s = 2αT where α is an unknown
constant.

[13] H. B. G. Casimir, in reference 6, gives the force per unit area due to electromagnetic zero-
point radiation. The Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum gives a diﬀerent force per unit area, F/A =
−ζ(3)kBT /(4πx3). See, for example, T. H. Boyer, ”Temperature dependence of Van der Waals
forces in classical electrodynamics with classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation,” Phys.
Rev. A 11, 1650-1663 (1975).

[14] See for example, G. H. Hardy, Divergent Series (Oxford University Press, London, 1956).
[15] We notice that thermodynamics actually requires that U(T, ω) be a monotonically increas-
ing function of frequency as it goes from the low frequency limit U(T, ω) = T to the high-
frequency limit U(T, ω) = (1/2)ω. This already puts additional restrictions on the mono-
tonically decreasing functions f (ω/T ). However, we ﬁnd that even monotonically decreas-
ing functions f (ω/T ) which satisfy the limits in (14), as well as giving monotonic functions
U(T, ω) = T f (ω/T )+(1/2)ω, still do not necessarily lead to monotonic Casimir energy changes
∆U (x, L, T ) with partition position x. Such functions are excluded by fundamental thermo-

10

dynamic ideas. However, such thermodynamic restrictions are all subsumed by the maximum-
entropy principle.

[16] It is curious and perhaps signiﬁcant that the Euler-Maclaurin expansion which enters Casimir
calculations involves the same Bernoulli numbers as appear in the coeﬃcients of the hyper-
bolic tangent function. See, for example, R. P. Boas and C. Stutz, ”Estimating sums with
integrals,” Am. J. Phys. 39, 745 (1971) and M. Abramowitz and J. Stegun, eds., Handbook of
Mathematical Functions (Dover, New York, 1965), pp. 804 and 806.

[17] There are, however, Casimir forces and changes in Helmholtz free energy. One also ﬁnds
interesting temperature-independent entropy changes with partition position ∆SRJ (x, L, T ) =
(1/2) |ln[x/(L − x)]|. This seems reminiscent of temperature-independent changes associated
with the mixing entropy of ideal gas particles. Similar changes have been noted in quantum
ﬁeld theory by J. C. da Silva, A. Matos Neto, H. Q. Placido, M. Revzen, and A. E. Santan,
”Casimir eﬀect for conducting and permeable plates at ﬁnite temperature,” Physica A 292,
411-421 (2001).

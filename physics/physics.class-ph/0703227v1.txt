Abstract

We develop a theory to represent dislocated single crystals at the meso-
scopic scale by considering concentrated eﬀects, governed by the distribu-
tion theory combined with multiple-valued kinematic ﬁelds. Our approach
gives a new understanding of the continuum theory of defects as devel-
oped by Kr¨oner (1980) and other authors. Fundamental 2D identities
relating the incompatibility tensor to the Frank and Burgers vectors are
proved under global strain assumptions relying on the geometric measure
theory, thereby giving rise to rigorous homogenisation from mesoscopic to
macroscopic scale.

Introduction

Dislocations can be considered as the most undesirable and resistant class of defects
for several kinds of single crystals (Maroudas and Brown, 1991; Jordan et al., 2000).
Therefore, in order to improve crystal quality, the development of a relevant and ac-
curate physical model represents a key issue with a view to reducing the dislocation
density in the crystal by acting in an appropriate way on the temperature ﬁeld and the
solid-liquid interface shape during the growth process (Van den Bogaert and Dupret,
1997).
However the dislocation models available in the literature, such as the model of Alexan-
der and Haasen (1968, 1986), are often based on a rather crude extension of models
previously developed for polycrystals (such as usual metals and ceramics).
In this
case, some particular features of single crystals, such as material anisotropy or the
existence of preferential glide planes, can be taken into account up to some extent, but
the fundamental physics of dislocations in single crystals cannot be captured. In fact,
dislocations are lines that either form loops, or end at the single crystal boundary, or
join together at some locations, while each dislocation segment has a constant Burgers
vector which exhibits additive properties at dislocation junctions. These properties
play a fundamental role in the modelling of line defects in single crystals and induce
key conservation laws at the macro-scale (typically deﬁned by the crystal diameter).
On the contrary, no dislocation conservation law exists at the macro-scale for poly-
crystals since dislocations can abruptly end at grain boundaries inside the medium
without any conservation law holding across these interfaces.

1

Aware of these principles and of the pioneer works of Volterra (1907) and Cosserat
(1909), Burgers (1939), Eshelby, Frank and Nabarro (1951, 1956), Kondo (1952), Nye
(1953), and Kr¨oner (1980) among other authors (Bilby, 1960; Mura, 1987) consider a
tensorial density to model dislocations in single crystals at the macro-scale, in order to
take into account both the dislocation orientation and the associated Burgers vector
(cf the survey contributions of Kr¨oner (1980, 1990) and Kleinert (1989)). However,
in these works, the relationship between macro-scale crystal properties and the basic
physics governing the nano-scale (deﬁned by the inter-atomic distance) is not com-
pletely justiﬁed from a mathematical viewpoint. Therefore, to well deﬁne the concept
of tensorial dislocation density, we here introduce an additional scale to the macro-and
nano-scales, viz. the meso-scale as deﬁned by the average distance between disloca-
tions. The laws governing dislocation behaviour are modelled at the nano-scale, while
the meso-scale (deﬁned from the nano-scale by ensemble averaging or by averaging over
a representative volume (Kr¨oner, 2001)) deﬁnes the ”dislocated continuous medium”,
where each dislocation is viewed as a line and the interactions between dislocations
can be modelled while the laws of linear elasticity govern the adjacent medium.
The present paper focuses on meso-scale modelling with a view to clarifying the ho-
mogenisation process from meso- to macro-scale. Since dislocations are lines at the
meso-scale, concentrated eﬀects, as governed by the distribution theory (a key ref-
erence is here Schwartz (1957)), must be introduced in the mesoscopic model.
In
addition, since integration around the dislocations generates a multiple-valued dis-
placement ﬁeld with the dislocations as branching lines, multivalued functions must
be considered (Almgren, 1986; Knopp, 1996; Remmert, 1996). This combination of
distributional eﬀects and multivaluedness is a key feature of the dislocation theory
at the meso-scale but, unfortunately, the diﬃculties resulting from this mathematical
association have not well been addressed so far in the literature (Thom, 1980). As an
example, non-commuting diﬀerentiation operators are freely introduced without any
justiﬁcation by Kleinert (1989). Therefore, the principal objective of this paper is to
provide a strong mathematical foundation to the meso-scale theory of dislocations,
showing how the distribution and geometric measure theories can be correctly used
with multiple-valued ﬁelds. In particular, the application limits of Stokes’ theorem
are clariﬁed. For the sake of generality, disclinations, which represent a second but
rarer kind of line defect, with in addition a multiple-valued rotation ﬁeld, are here
considered together with dislocations.
After homogenisation from meso- to macro-scale, no concentrated eﬀects remain any-
more present in the macroscopic model, which consists of a set of evolution PDE’s
governing scalar or tensorial defect density ﬁelds in the framework of elasto- or visco-
plasticity (Kratochvil and Dillon, 1969). However, it should be pointed out that
homogenisation from meso- to macro-scale has no meaning for multiple-valued ﬁelds
such as displacement and rotation, since this operation is exclusively allowed for addi-
tive (or extensive) ﬁelds such as stress, energy density or heat ﬂux. This consideration
becomes obvious when homogenisation is deﬁned by an ensemble averaging procedure,
since multiple-valued ﬁelds are mathematically deﬁned as extended functions which
cannot be added since their ”domains” depend on the defect line locations. This issue
is clariﬁed in the present paper. Moreover, since the macroscopic displacement and
rotation ﬁelds are not deﬁned as ensemble averages of their mesoscopic counterparts,
no unique privileged reference conﬁguration can be deﬁned at the macro-scale for sin-
gle crystals with dislocations. Having in mind that displacement and rotation ﬁelds
are deﬁned with respect to the selected reference conﬁguration (which can be, or not,
defect free), the invariance laws governing the behaviour of single crystals with line
defects at the macro-scale are constructed in accordance with this observation.
In the literature the macroscopic dislocation density is classically deﬁned as the curl
of the plastic distortion (Head et al., 1993; Cermelli and Gurtin, 2001; Gurtin, 2002;
Koslowski et al., 2002; Ariza and Ortiz, 2005), following a postulated distortion decom-

2

position into elastic and plastic parts. However, this approach cannot be rigorously
justiﬁed (contrarily to the strain decomposition) since elastic and plastic rotations
cannot be set apart. In contrast, the present paper introduces the macroscopic dis-
location density by homogenisation of well-deﬁned mesoscopic ﬁelds, under precise
geometric-measure model assumptions, from which the distortion decomposition is
obtained together with its relationship with the dislocation density. Since dislocations
and disclinations represent body torsion and curvature, respectively, these concepts
also appear as macroscopic counterparts of well-deﬁned mesoscopic defect measures.
The present paper is restricted to the 2D theory. Extension to the 3D case is under
investigation. A complete link between the mesoscopic and macroscopic behaviours
of single crystals with line defects should be derived from these developments.
In
Section 2, the scaling analysis summarised in this introduction is detailed and the
basic concepts used to represent the dislocated continuous medium are introduced.
Classical invariance theorems are recalled in Section 3. In Section 4, the 2D distribu-
tional theory of the dislocated continuous medium is established in the case of a single
dislocation, while Section 5 treats the more general case of an ensemble of isolated
dislocations. Finally, Section 6 introduces the non-Riemannian macroscopic body by
homogenisation from the mesoscale, and conclusions are drawn in Section 7.

2 Multiscale analysis of dislocations

To address the modelling of elastic single crystals with line defects, the various scales
relevant for matter description and their interrelations are brieﬂy reviewed.

• At the nano-scale the characteristic length is the interatomic distance. At time
t, the body is referred to as R⋆⋆(t) and the reference body is a perfect lattice
R⋆⋆
0 .

• At the meso-scale the characteristic length is the average distance between two
neighbour dislocation lines. At time t, the body is referred to as R⋆(t), to be
interpreted as a random sample corresponding to a given growth experiment.
The reference body R⋆
0 is a perfect crystal, i.e. a body without dislocations or
disclinations.

• At the macro-scale the characteristic length is the diameter of the crystal and
the body R(t) has a physical meaning related to R⋆(t) and R⋆⋆(t) in terms of
ensemble average; the reference body R0 can be, or not, a perfect crystal.

2.1 Nano-scale analysis: crystalline lattice
Given a dislocation in the general sense, the atomic arrangement R⋆⋆(t) diﬀers from
the reference lattice R⋆⋆
0 , but however the atom displacements are not uniquely deﬁned
(Kleinert, 1989). More exactly, a discrete multivalued mapping xi := χ⋆⋆
i (Xl) where
i = 1, 2 or 3, is deﬁned with Xl ∈ R⋆⋆
0 and xi ∈ R⋆⋆(t). In general, the dislocation
position cannot be determined precisely at the atomic level since several dislocation
locations in the actual crystal can be associated with the same picture of the atom
positions.
In fact the defect should be understood as located inside a nanoscopic
lattice region. Let us insist on the fact that there is no way to uniquely deﬁne the
displacement ﬁeld.
can in principle be selected to deﬁne
the displacement of a given atom of R⋆⋆(t) which is therefore a multivalued discrete
mapping. This remark also makes sense at higher scales.

Indeed any atom of R⋆⋆
0

2.2 Meso-scale analysis: dislocated continuous medium

This scale is the one on which this paper focuses, in the framework of 2D linear
elasticity. Let us here describe some general and basic ﬁeld properties at the meso-

3

scale level. Details are given in the forthcoming sections.

• The displacement ﬁeld is a multivalued function such that for any point Xl ∈ R⋆
0

one has

i (Xl) = xi − Xi, with xi := χ⋆
u⋆

i (Xl),

i (Xl) is a multivalued mapping from R⋆

and where χ⋆
0 to R⋆(t). Displacement
multivaluedness represents an important diﬃculty to address at the meso-scale
in dislocation modelling. As opposed to multiple-valued ﬁelds, single-valued
ﬁelds will also be called uniform.
• The strain will be denoted by E ⋆

ij . In general, the Lagrange deformation tensor

is given by

E ⋆
ij :=

(∂ju⋆

i + ∂iu⋆

j + ∂ju⋆

m∂iu⋆

m), with ∂ju⋆

i :=

1
2

∂u⋆
i
∂Xj

,

with the classical indicial notations and summation convention used.
In the
sequel, linear elasticity will be assumed and hence the nonlinear terms are not
taken into account at the meso-scale. This fundamental hypothesis relies on the
assumption1 that all nonlinear deformation eﬀects take place around the disloca-
tion in a nano-scale region whose diameter is small compared to the meso-scale
characteristic distance. Therefore, using a singular perturbation asymptotic
treatment, the nonlinear eﬀects become concentrated inside the defect line at
the meso-scale and hence the strain can be assumed to be the single-valued
linear symmetric tensor given by

E ⋆
ij :=

(∂ju⋆

i + ∂iu⋆
j )

2

outside the defect line and arbitrarily set to 0 on the defect line (noting that
concentrated deformation eﬀects inside this line do not play any role in displace-
ment integration at the meso-scale).

• The inﬁnitesimal rotation tensor is a possibly multiple-valued ﬁeld given by

ω⋆

ij := 1

2 (∂ju⋆

i − ∂iu⋆

j ) with the associated rotation vector given by

k = −

k and B⋆
and the identity ω⋆

associated with a defect line are commonly deﬁned as functions of the jumps
of ω⋆

shown as invariants of the defect line.

Here, the symbol δiL is used to represent the concentrated vectorial measure density
on the defect region L. In particular, when L is a rectiﬁable curve, δiL is equal to τiδL
with τi the unit tangent vector to L and δL the one-dimensional Hausdorﬀ measure
density concentrated on L.
The disclination and dislocation density tensors Θ⋆
ij are measure densities (cf
Evans and Gariepy, 1992; Mattila, 1995) related to the so-called strain incompatibility

is a defect line (i.e. a singular line for the strain) to which non-vanishing Burgers
and/or Frank vectors are attached. The tensors Λ⋆
ij and Θ⋆
ij are basic physical tools
to model defect density at the meso-scale while η⋆
ij plays a key role to understand
their behaviour. The displacement jump density and mesoscopic contortion (or lattice
curvature) tensors α⋆
ij are combinations of these basic density tensors, with
α⋆

ij when the disclination density tensor vanishes.

2.3 Macro-scale analysis: continuous medium

At this level, a point xi of the actual body R(t), xi = χi(Xl) where X ∈ R0 will be
called a material point to be understood as a certain volume of matter of mesoscopic
size located around the point xi.
In order to deﬁne macroscopic concepts such as
temperature or stress, one needs to give a meaning to the temperature and stress at
any point. The rigorous deﬁnition is obtained from an ergodicity argument and hence,
at the macroscopic level the ﬁelds on R(t) are deﬁned as ensemble averages of the
ﬁelds deﬁned on R⋆(t). By this operation these ﬁelds are smoothed, which means that
concentration eﬀects at the meso-scale level along the defect lines are erased. To this
end, a weak limiting procedure (or homogenisation) is needed in order to deﬁne the
dislocation and disclination densities Λij and Θij at the macro-scale level from the
knowledge of the meso-scale ﬁelds Λ⋆

ij and Θ⋆
ij.

Remark 2.1 In this context, the reference body R0 is basically arbitrary and can,
or not, be a perfect crystal. Indeed, at the macro-scale, the displacement ui must be
a single-valued function, while the displacement ﬁeld u⋆
i is multivalued at the meso-
scale. Therefore, u⋆
i cannot be considered as belonging to a (linear) Banach space
(single-valued functions can be added since they share the same domain, whereas a
multivalued function is deﬁned on its speciﬁc Riemann foliation and cannot be added
to a multivalued function deﬁned on another Riemann foliation). Consequently the
ensemble averaging procedure is forbidden for multivalued ﬁelds such as u⋆
i and hence
ui is not the ensemble average of u⋆
i . It should also be observed that removing the ﬁeld
multivaluedness by performing appropriate cuts is of no use here, since by derivation
these cuts introduce arbitrary distributional contributions without physical meaning. In
general, it is important to make it clear that the only ﬁelds which can be obtained at
the macro-scale by ensemble averaging from the meso-scale are the so-called extensive
ﬁelds associated with additive physical properties (such as speciﬁc mass, stress, speciﬁc
internal energy... and the dislocation and disclination densities).

3 Multiple-valued ﬁelds and line invariants; dis-
tributions as a modelling tool at the meso-
scale

Notations 3.1 In the following sections, the assumed open domain is denoted by Ω
(in practise but not necessarily Ω is bounded), the defect line(s) are indicated by L ∈ Ω,
and ΩL is the chosen symbol for Ω \ L, which is also assumed to be open without loss of
generality. Focussing on the meso-scale, symbol ˆx or ˆxi denotes a generic point of the
defect line(s), x or xi is a generic point of ΩL and x0 or x0i is a given ﬁxed reference

5

point of ΩL. When x and ˆx are used together, ˆx denotes the projection of x onto the
defect line(s) L in a appropriate sense and ˆνi := νi(ˆx, x) is the unit vector joining ˆx
to x. The symbol ⊙ǫ is intended for a set of diameter 2ǫ enclosing the region L. More
precisely, ⊙ǫ is deﬁned as the intersection with Ω of the union of all closed spheres of
radius ǫ centred on L:

⊙ǫ := Ω ∩

B[ˆx, ǫ].

[ˆx∈L

In case L is an isolated line, ⊙ǫ is a tube of radius ǫ enclosing L.
In the sequel,
considering a surface S of Ω crossed by L at ˆx and bounded by the curve C, symbols
dC, dL, and dS will denote the 1D Hausdorﬀ measures on C and L, and the 2D
Hausdorﬀ measure on S, respectively, with ˆσj and τj the unit tangent vectors to C
at x and to L at ˆx (when they exist). In some cases (having fractal curves in mind)
the symbols dxk and dSi := ǫijkdx(1)
k will stand for inﬁnitesimal vectors oriented
along C and normal to S, respectively, with in addition dCl(x) := ǫlmndxmτn denoting
an inﬁnitesimal vector normal to C when τn = τn(ˆx) exists.

Assumption 3.1 (Mesoscopic elastic strain) Henceforth we will assume that the
linear strain E ⋆
3×3)-tensor prolonged by 0 on the line
L, L1-integrable on Ω and compatible on ΩL. In other words, the equality

mn is a given symmetric C∞(ΩL, R

ǫqlmǫkpn∂l∂pE ⋆

mn = 0

(3.1)

is assumed everywhere on ΩL.

3.1 Distributional analysis of the multiple-valued ﬁelds

In general, a multivalued function from ΩL to R
mappings with appropriate properties:

N consists of a pair of single-valued

F → ΩL and

F → R

N ,

where F is the associated Riemann foliation (Almgren, 1986; Knopp, 1996; Remmert,
1996). In the present case of meso-scale elasticity, we limit ourselves to multivalued
functions obtained by recursive line integration of single-valued mappings deﬁned on
ΩL. Reducing these multiple line integrals to simple line integrals, the Riemann folia-
tion shows to be the set of equivalence path classes in ΩL from a given x0 ∈ ΩL with
the homotopy as equivalence relationship. Accordingly, a multivalued function will be
called of index n on ΩL if its n-th diﬀerential is single-valued on ΩL. No other kinds
of multifunctions are considered in this work, whether L is a single line or belongs to
a more complex set of defect lines (with possible branchings, etc.).

j

Notations 3.2 The notation ∂(s)
is used for partial derivation of a single- or multiple-
valued function whose domain is restricted to ΩL. Locally around x ∈ ΩL, for smooth
functions, the meanings of ∂(s)
and the classical ∂j are the same, whereas on the
entire Ω the partial derivation operator ∂j only applies to single-valued ﬁelds and must
be understood in the distributive sense. A defect-free subset U of Ω is an open set such
that U ∩ L = ∅, in such a way that ∂(s)
and ∂j coincide on U for every single- or
multiple-valued function of index 1.

In the following essential deﬁnition the strain is considered as a distribution on Ω:

where the second term inside the parenthesis is precisely added in order to achieve
convergence. One readily sees after integration by parts that expression (3.4) is equal
to Eq. (3.3) provided lim
Ω \ ⊙ǫ = ΩL (which is a general hypothesis limiting the ac-
ǫ→0
ceptable defect lines together with the assumption that L is of vanishing 2D Hausdorﬀ
measure). Considering the possibly multivalued (with index 1) rotation vector ω⋆
k, it
should be observed from Deﬁnition 3.1 that ∂mω⋆
k on ΩL. This results from
the classical relationship provided by elasticity theory between inﬁnitesimal rotation
and deformation derivatives. However, ∂mω⋆
k is deﬁned by Eq. (3.2) as a distribution
on Ω and therefore concentrated eﬀects on L and its inﬁnitesimal vicinity are added
to ∂(s)
k without giving to
∂m the meaning of a derivation operator. In particular, it may be observed that the
identical vanishing of ∂(s)
k on ΩL does not necessarily imply that the distribution
∂mω⋆
k vanishes as well. In fact from Eq. (3.4), it can be shown in this particular case
that

3.2 Rotation and displacement vectors

The rotation vector is deﬁned from the knowledge of the linear strain together with
the rotation at a given reference point x0. From this construction follows an invariance
property of ω⋆
k as a multifunction (recalling that multivaluedness takes its origin from
the existence of a defect line which renders the strain incompatible on the entire Ω).
Starting from the distributive Deﬁnition 3.1 of ∂mω⋆
kdξm
is integrated along a regular parametric curve Γ ⊂ ΩL with endpoints x0, x ∈ ΩL. For
selected x0 and ω⋆

0k, the multivalued rotation vector is deﬁned as

where #Γ is the equivalence class of all regular curves homotopic to Γ in ΩL. Indeed,
from strain compatibility in ΩL, i.e. from relation (3.1), it is clear that ω⋆
k is a function
of #Γ only. Consider now a regular parametric loop C (in case C is a planar loop, it is
called Jordan curve) and the equivalence class #C of all regular loops homotopic to C
in ΩL. Here, the extremity points play no role anymore and two loops are equivalent

7

if and only if they can be continuously transformed into each other in ΩL. The jump
of the rotation vector ω⋆

k along #C depends on #C only and is deﬁned as2

ZC

The following developments address the displacement ﬁeld multivaluedness as a mere
consequence of strain incompatibility. The procedure deﬁning the displacement vector
from the rotation vector by means of line integrals is classical in linear elasticity. The
following tensor plays in the construction of the displacement ﬁeld a role analogous to
∂mω⋆

k in the construction of the rotation ﬁeld:

Let us now, for the sake of simplicity, focus on the case of a defect line L which (i)
can itself be represented as a single C0, closed or not, parametric line without multiple
points except possibly its extremities and (ii) is isolated in the sense that each of its
points ˆx is located inside a smooth surface S(ˆx) bounded by a loop C(ˆx) and such
that S(ˆx) \ {ˆx} ⊂ ΩL. Such a defect line L will be called an isolated dislocation or
disclination. The jump [ω⋆
k around L is deﬁned as the jump
of ω⋆
k along #C(ˆx) and hence is the same for any ˆx and suitable C(ˆx). Similarly, the
k around L is deﬁned as the jump of b⋆
jump [b⋆
k along #C(ˆx) and is
also the same for any ˆx and suitable C(ˆx), given x0. In fact, the following result is
well-known (Kleinert, 1989):

on fractal curves and the related Stokes’ and Gauss-Green’s theorems are analysed by Harrison
and Norton (1992), where it is shown, by the C∞-smoothness of the diﬀerential form ∂mω⋆

on ΩL that Eq. (3.7) still holds even when the Hausdorﬀ dimension of C is higher than 1.

¿From this result, the Frank and Burgers vectors can be deﬁned as invariants of the
single isolated line L.

Deﬁnition 3.3 [Frank and Burgers vectors] The Frank vector of the line L is the
invariant

k],

while for a given reference point x0 its Burgers vector is the invariant

k](x) − ǫklmΩ⋆

l (xm − x0m).

A defect line with non-vanishing Frank vector is called a disclination while a defect
line with non-vanishing Burgers vector is called a dislocation.

Clearly a disclination should always be considered as a dislocation by appropriate
choice of x0 while the reverse statement is false since Ω⋆
k might vanish. This is why
in the present paper, the word ”dislocation” means in the general sense a dislocation
and/or a disclination. A pure dislocation is a dislocation with vanishing Frank vector.

in such a way that B⋆

Therefore, for a non-zero Frank vector, the vanishing of the Burgers vector depends on
the arbitrary choice of x0.

The following result can be readily shown and is fundamental in the framework of our
investigations since it implies conservation laws at the meso- and macro-scales.

Deﬁnition 3.4 (Mesoscopic strain incompatibility) According to Eq. (3.1) com-
bined with Eq. (3.3), the incompatibility tensor is deﬁned by

The strain ﬁeld is called compatible on the set U if the associated incompatibility tensor
vanishes on U .

4 Distributional analysis of incompatibility for

a single rectilinear dislocation

4.1 The 2D model for rectilinear dislocations
2D elasticity means that the strain E ⋆
ij is independent of the ”vertical” coordinate z.
However this assumption introduces no restriction on the dependence of the multiple-
valued displacement and rotation ﬁelds upon z.

9

Notations 4.1 Henceforth the single defect line will be assumed to be located along
the z-axis. The two planar coordinates will be denoted by x and y or xα. The projec-
tion of x = (xα, z) on L is ˆx = (0, 0, z). By convention, Latin indices i, j, k, l, · · · take
their values from 1 to 3 and are basically used for 3D elasticity, while Greek indices
α, β, γ, δ, · · · take the values 1 or 2 and are used for 2D elasticity. Symbols (ex, ey, ez)
or (eα, ez) denote the Cartesian base vectors, while (er, eθ, ez) denote the local cylin-
drical base vectors. For a planar curve C, the notation dCα(x) = ǫαβdxβ will be used
for the curve normal.

Let us observe that many ﬁelds are singular at the origin and that ΩL is in fact
the domain where the laws of linear elasticity apply. Moreover, the strain can be
decomposed into three tensors:

In general, the present theory does not make any use of the linear elasticity constitu-
tive laws and of the momentum and energy conservation laws, since in the framework
of Continuum Mechanics arbitrary body forces and heat supply could be applied.
However the remaining of this section will be devoted to present the three classical
examples of 2D line-defects for which the medium is assumed to be body force free
and isothermal (detailed computations are given in Appendix A).

nation. Therefore, a Hadamard ﬁnite part distribution (Schwartz, 1957; Estrada and
Kanwal, 1989) is needed to represent the compliance at the meso-scale (another ap-
proach makes use of strain molliﬁcation by a so-called core tensor (Koslowski et al.,
2002)). This issue, whose solution requires to develop matched asymptotic expansions
around the singular line in accordance with the inﬁnitesimal displacement hypothesis,
will not be addressed further in the present paper which only focuses on the geometry
of dislocations.

4.2 Mesoscopic incompatibility for a single defect line

For 2D problems the incompatibility vector contains all the information provided
by the general incompatibility tensor. The latter expresses on the one hand the non-
commutative action of the defect line over the second derivatives of the rotation vector
and on the other hand is related to concentrated eﬀects of the Frank and Burgers
vectors along the defect line.

Deﬁnition 4.1 In the 2D case, the mesoscopic incompatibility vector is deﬁned by
η⋆
k := ǫαβ∂α∂βω⋆
k.

(4.9)

A strain ﬁeld is compatible if the associated incompatibility vector vanishes.

As shown in the following sections, concentration eﬀects will be represented by means
of ﬁrst- and second-order distributions.

Notations 4.2 Recalling Notations 4.1, Ωz and Ω0
z stand for the sets Ωz := {x ∈
Ω such that x = (xα, z)} and Ω0
z := Ωz \ L, while the radius r = kx − ˆxk is the
distance from a point x inside Ω to L. Then, the 1D Hausdorﬀ measure concentrated on
L is denoted by δL (cf Ambrosio et al. (2000), Evans and Gariepy (1992) and Mattila
(1995) for general deﬁnitions and properties on the geometric measure theory).

In what follows the hypothesis consists in assuming that the strain radial dependence
in the vicinity of L is less singular than a critical threshold. This is veriﬁed for instance
by the wedge disclination whose strain radial behaviour is O(ln r) and by the screw and
edge dislocations whose strains are O(r−1).3 For a straight defect-line L, according to
these examples, the hypotheses on the strain and Frank tensors read as follows:

3A function f (ǫ) is said to be O (g(ǫ)) (ǫ → 0+) if there exists K, ǫ0 > 0 s.t. 0 < ǫ < ǫ0 ⇒

|f (ǫ)| ≤ K|g(ǫ)|. A function f (ǫ) is said to be o (g(ǫ)) (ǫ → 0+) if

Assumption 4.1 [2D strain for line defects] The strain tensor E ⋆

the vertical coordinate z, is compatible on ΩL in the sense that conditions (4.1) hold,
is smooth on ΩL and L1-integrable on Ω.

Proof. For some small enough ǫ > 0 and using Notations 3.1 a tube ⊙ǫ can be
constructed around L and inside Ω. Assuming that the smooth 3D test-function ϕ has
its compact support containing part of L, Ωǫ,z denotes the slice of Ω \ ⊙ǫ obtained for
a given ˆx ∈ L, i.e.

Ωǫ,z := {x ∈ Ωz

||xα|| > ǫ},

while the boundary circle of Ωǫ,z is designated by Cǫ,z.
N Let us ﬁrstly treat the left-hand side of Eq. (4.10). Indeed, from Deﬁnition 4.1 with

5 Distributional analysis of incompatibility for

a set of isolated dislocations

In the previous section, a single defect line was considered. However, to address
the macro-scale physics, homogenisation must be performed on a set of dislocation
lines whose number tends to inﬁnity in order to deﬁne regular defect density tensors.
Therefore, our goal is to introduce appropriate hypotheses that can easily be applied
to a set of defect lines and to a regular defect density as well.

5.1 Governing assumptions for the strain and Frank ten-

sors

Besides the strain Assumptions 4.1 two measure hypotheses on the strain derivatives
are introduced to replace the local Assumption 4.2 in order to validate Theorem 4.1
in a global framework.

Assumption 5.1 The strain divergence and trace gradient ∂αE ⋆
Radon measures on Ω.4

αi and ∂γE ⋆

κκ are ﬁnite

4A ﬁnite Radon measure on Ω is a measure bounded on compact subsets of Ω.

16

Remark 5.1 No assumption could be made on the complete Lebesgue integrable strain
gradient without contradicting the 2D examples of Appendix A. On the other hand, it
can be shown that the sharp Assumption 5.1 are required to demonstrate Proposition
5.4.

Remark 5.2 Assumption 5.1 is natural in inﬁnitesimal elasticity if one considers the
strain-stress constitutive law and the equilibrium laws. As a consequence, the stress
divergence must be a measure on Ω.

The following Lemmas are needed for the proof of Proposition 5.4.

Lemma 5.1

• A solenoidal distributional vector ﬁeld aα on Ωz writes as

with φ ∈ D′(Ωz).

• A symmetric solenoidal distribution tensor aαβ on Ωz writes as

aα = ǫαγ ∂γ φ,

aαβ = ǫαγ ǫβτ ∂γ ∂τ ψ,

with ψ ∈ D′(Ωz).

Proof.

• First statement. Let φ0 be any x2-primitive distribution of a1 (Schwartz, 1957).
Then ∂2φ0 = a1 and, from the solenoidal property of aα, there exists a distri-
bution G(x1) s.t. ∂1φ0 + a2 = G(x1). By x1-primitivation of G(x1), it is easy
to ﬁnd F (x1) s.t. ∂1F = G(x1), and to verify that φ = φ0 + F (x1) solves the
problem.

• Second statement. ¿From ∂αaαβ = 0, there is a distribution φβ s.t. aαβ =
ǫαγ ∂γφβ. Then ǫαγ ∂γ (∂βφβ) ∂βaαβ = 0 and hence ∂βφβ is a constant C or
equivalently ∂β(φβ − 1
2 Cxβ) = 0. From Eq. (5.1), there exists a distribution ψ
such that φβ − 1
2 ǫαβC. The
(cid:3)
symmetry of aαβ implies that C = 0.

2 Cxβ = ǫβτ ∂τ ψ, and hence aαβ = ǫαγ ǫβτ ∂γ∂τ ψ + 1

Lemma 5.2

• For a given L1(Ωz)-scalar function f , there exists an irrotational

distribution ﬁeld gβ such that

• For a given L1(Ωz)-vector function fβ such that ∂βfβ = ∆g where g is a L1(Ωz)

function, there exists a symmetric compatible tensor gαβ on Ωz such that

Proof.

• First statement. It is suﬃcient to consider an ultra-weak solution (Brezis, 1983)

of ∆H = f and to deﬁne gβ = ∂βH.

11, f2 = ∂2g⋆

• Second statement. By primitivation, there is a non-compatible L1(Ωz)-ﬁeld g⋆
αβ
such that f1 = ∂1g⋆
12. A necessary condition
for gαβ to exist is that ˆgαβ = gαβ − g⋆
αβ veriﬁes ∂αˆgαβ = 0, or by Lemma 5.1
that ˆgαβ = ǫαγ ǫβτ ∂γ∂τ φ for some gauge distribution φ. In order that gαβ be
compatible on Ωz, φ must satisfy the following equation, equivalent to the 2D
compatibility of gαβ on Ωz:

22 and 0 = g⋆

21 = g⋆

∆∆φ = ∆g⋆

κκ − ∂β∂αgαβ = ∆(g⋆

κκ − g).

∂αgαβ = fβ.

(5.11)

Up to a harmonic and hence smooth function on Ωz, the solution of Eq. (5.5) is
the solution of ∆φ = g⋆
κκ − g. Since the right-hand side is L1(Ωz), a solution φ
exists in the ultra-weak sense and hence the existence of a symmetric compatible
(cid:3)
distribution ﬁeld gαβ on Ωz verifying Eq. (5.4) follows.

Lemma 5.3 For constant C and Cβ, there are a vector gκ and a symmetric, compat-
ible tensor Gαβ on Ωz such that

∂κgκ = Cδ0,
∂αGαβ = Cβδ0.

Proof. The solutions are given by gκ = (2π)−1∂κ log r and Gαβ =

Lemma 5.4 Under Assumptions 4.1 and 5.1, the strain components can be put in the
form:

where vector Eκ has a vanishing curl on Ωz for any given z while vector eκ is o(r−2)

eαβ is o(r−2) as r → 0+.
Proof. By Assumption 5.1, ∂κE ⋆

κi is a Radon measure on Ωz, and hence writes by

∂κE ⋆

κi = fi + φi,

where fi ∈ L1(Ωz) and where φi is a Radon measure on Ωz singular with respect to
Lebesgue’s measure. As a mere consequence of the smoothness of ∂κE ⋆

a concentrated measure on Ωz and hence is proportional to the Dirac mass δ0,

account the irrotational property of gκ in such a way that ∆ψ = ǫκβ∂βE ⋆

Since E ⋆
κz is a L1-vector, its curl is a ﬁrst-order distribution5 and hence, by the
strain compatibility which ensures the curl of E ⋆
κz to be a constant K on Ω0
z
and a combination of the Dirac mass and its ﬁrst-order derivatives at the origin
(Schwartz, 1957), writes as K + cδ + cγ ∂γ δ.

(5.14)

where h is a solution of ∆h = K on Ωz. It is easily veriﬁed that the curl of ψ is

z = ∆∆A on Ωz.

Hence, since the left-hand side writes as a combination of derivatives of δ0 of
order lower or equal to 1, the ﬁeld A is the solution of ∆A = (a + aγ∂γ ) log r
with constant a, aγ , up to a smooth harmonic function on Ωz. It follows that

6.1 A ﬁrst approach to homogenisation from meso- to

macro-scale

The mesoscopic results given in the previous sections are now homogenised (in an ap-
propriate manner, whose description (Kr¨oner, 2001) is not the purpose of this paper).
Indeed, in the context of linear elasticity, the macroscopic elastic strain Eij is obtained
by averaging the mesoscopic stress σ⋆
ij and hence the macroscopic elastic incompati-
bility ηik is obtained by averaging the mesoscopic incompatibility η⋆
ik. Moreover the
defect densities are homogenised and the macroscopic counterparts of Θ⋆
k and
κ⋆
ij write as Θk, Λk, αk, and κij , with

The macroscopic density tensors Λk and κij , as obtained from the single-valued meso-
scopic densities, have a geometrical interpretation (Kr¨oner, 1980; Anthony, 1970)
which will be discussed in the following section. Indeed, αk is directly related to the
torsion of a body submitted to an incompatible purely elastic deformation to which a
non-Riemannian connexion is attached due to the contortion κij .

ZC

6.2 The non-Riemannian macroscopic body

The following geometric objects are introduced after homogenisation of the well-
deﬁned mesoscopic elastic strain and defect densities, in order to provide the model of
a macroscopic body endowed with a law of parallel displacement together with internal
torsion accounting for the defective crystal structure.

introduce the above objects.

7Note that diﬀerent sign conventions for the rotation vector and incompatibility apply in

Kr¨oner’s work.

23

Since small displacements are considered, no distinction is to be made between upper
and lower indices.

Lemma 6.1 The tensor gij deﬁnes a Riemannian metric. The symmetric Christoﬀel
symbols ˜Γk;ij deﬁne a symmetric connexion compatible with this metric, while Tk;ij and
∆Γk;ij are skew-symmetric tensors w.r.t. i and j and i and k, respectively. Moreover,
the components of Tk;ij for i = z or j = z vanish in the 2D case.

Proof. The ﬁrst statements follow from basic deﬁnitions (Dubrovin et al., 1992;
Schouten, 1954) while the last one follows from the fact that, in the 2D case, αpk(xL)
and Θpm(xL) for L ∈ L are proportional to τpδL(xL) with τp standing for the tangent
(cid:3)
vector to the defect line.

Proposition 6.1 The Cristoﬀel symbols Γk;ij deﬁne a non-symmetric connexion com-
patible with the metric gij and whose torsion writes as Tk;ij.8

Proof.
It is easy to verify (Dubrovin et al., 1992) that Γk;ij is a connexion since
˜Γk;ij is a connexion and ∆Γk;ij is a tensor. Denoting by ∇k (resp. ˜∇k) the covariant
gradient w.r.t. Γk;ij (resp. ˜Γk;ij), and recalling that a connexion is compatible with
the metric gij if the covariant gradient of gij w.r.t. this connexion vanishes, we ﬁnd
by Eq. (6.13)

∇kgij : = ∂kgij − Γl;ikglj − Γl;jkgli

= ˜∇kgij + ∆Γl;ikglj + ∆Γl;jkgli,

(6.14)

where in the right-hand side, the 1st term vanishes by Lemma 6.1 while the 2nd and
3rd terms cancel each other since ∆Γl;jkgli = ∆Γi;jk = −∆Γj;ik. It results that the
connexion torsion, i.e. the skew-symmetric part of ∆Γj;ik w.r.t. i and k, writes as

`

.

(6.15)

Observing that the 1st term in the right-hand side of Eq. (6.15) writes as ∆Γk;ij while,
by Deﬁnition 6.3 (Eq. (6.12)), the left-hand side and the two remaining terms of the
right-hand side of Eq. (6.15) are equal to Tj;ik, Tk;ji and −Ti;jk, respectively, the proof
(cid:3)
is complete.

´

The following result shows ∆Γk;ij as directly linked to the contortion κij .

Proposition 6.2 In the 2D case, the contortion tensor ∆Γk;ij writes in terms of κij
as

∆Γk;ij = δkκ (δiαδjβǫκακzβ) + δiαδjzǫατ κτ κ + δizδjβǫβτ κτ κ

− δkzδiαδjβǫαβκzz.

Proof. For k = z, by Deﬁnition 6.3, the last statement of Lemma 6.1, and Eq. (6.1),
it is found that ∆Γz;ij = ∆Γz;αβδiαδjβ, with

where parallel displacement along the crystallographic lines is deﬁned by the connexion Γk;ij
of Theorem 6.1 and where the metric is not deﬁned by Eq. (6.9), but by the motion of an
internal observer who would measure his own displacement by counting the atomic lattice
steps, without feeling the body torsion (Kr¨oner, 1980).

tion of the terms in Θz vanish in ∆Γκ;ij , the proof is completed by observing that
(cid:3)
ǫαβακ + ǫκααβ = (ǫακǫτ ν)ǫτ βαν = ǫακαβ = ǫακκzβ.
The following deﬁnition introduces two diﬀerential forms related, on the one hand (by
Deﬁnitions 6.2 and 6.3, and Theorem 6.1 and Proposition 6.1) to the homogenisation
of the well-deﬁned mesoscopic defect measures and, on the other hand, as shown by
the forthcoming theorem, to macroscopic incompatible rotation and distortion vectors.

Deﬁnition 6.4 The following diﬀerential forms are introduced:

dωj
dβkl

:= ðβωj dxβ,
:= −Γl;kβdxβ.

(6.16)

(6.17)

In the literature the existence of an elastic macroscopic distortion ﬁeld is generally
postulated (Mura, 1987; Head et al., 1993; Cermelli and Gurtin, 2001, 2002; Koslowski
et al., 2002; Ariza and Ortiz, 2005) and the global distortion decomposition in elastic
and plastic parts follows9. The point of view of the present paper is to avoid this kind of
a-priori decomposition, which we believe cannot be rigorously justiﬁed. Nevertheless,
the following theorem introduces rotation and distortion ﬁelds (which are not the
global rotation and distortion related to the macroscopic strain) in the absence of
disclinations. In contrast with the classical literature where it is basically postulated
that dislocation density is the distortion curl, this relationship is here well-proved.

Theorem 6.2 [Bravais rotation and distortion ﬁelds] If the macroscopic disclination
density vanishes, there exists rotation and distortion ﬁelds deﬁned as

BRAVAIS ROTATION

ωj(x) := ω0

with βkl = Ekl − ǫkljωj, and where ω0
line with endpoints x0 and x. Moreover,

j is arbitrary and the integration is made on any

∂αβkβ = ðαðβuk

and

ǫαβ∂αβkβ = αk.

(6.20)

Proof. By Deﬁnition 6.3, the symmetric part of the connexion writes as

− Γ(l;k)βdxβ = −

∂βgkldxβ = −

∂mgkldxm = ∂mEkldxm = dEkl,

while, by Deﬁnition 6.3 and Proposition 6.2, the skew-symmetric part writes as

− Γ[l;k]β = −

(∂kglβ − ∂lgkβ) + ∆Γl;kβ = ∂kElβ − ∂lEkβ + ∆Γl;kβ.

Observing, by Deﬁnitions 6.2 and 6.4 and Proposition 6.2, that dωj = ðβωjdxβ
= − 1
2 ǫlkjΓ[l;k]βdxβ, it results that dβkl = dEkl − ǫkljdωj. Under the assumption
of a vanishing macroscopic disclination density, the existence of well-deﬁned Bravais
rotation and distortion ﬁelds follows from Eqs. (6.16) and (6.20), Theorem 6.1, and
Remark 6.1. Moreover, since ∂αβkβ = ∂αEkβ − ǫkβjðαωj , by Eq.
(6.5), it equals
(cid:3)
ðαðβuk, completing the proof by Eq. (6.8).

9In fact, the distortion is often considered as a constitutive variable in dislocation models

(Davini, 1986; Gurtin, 2002; Ariza and Ortiz, 2005).

Remark 6.3 Referring to ”Bravais” instead of ”elastic” rotation and distortion ﬁelds
is devoted to highlight that these quantities do not have a purely elastic meaning

Remark 6.4 The Bravais distortion does not derive from a Bravais displacement in
the presence of dislocations. In fact, around a closed loop C, even if the macroscopic
disclination density vanishes, the displacement diﬀerential as deﬁned by duk := βkαdxα
veriﬁes by Theorem 6.2 the relationship:

duk =

ǫβα∂ββkαdS = αk(S).

shows the macroscopic Burgers vector and dislocation density together with the Bravais
rotation and distortion ﬁelds as reminiscences of the defective crystal properties at the

7 Concluding remarks

In this paper we have developed a 2D theory to analyse dislocated single crystals at
the meso-scale by combining distributions with multiple-valued kinematic ﬁelds. The
distributions are basically concentrated along the defect lines, which in turn form the
branching lines of the multivalued ﬁelds. As a consequence of this analysis, a basic
theorem relating the incompatibility tensor (as derived from the deformation ﬁeld) to
the Frank and Burgers vectors of the defect line has been established. This theory
provides a framework for the homogenisation of the medium properties from meso-
to macro-scale. In particular the macroscopic dislocation density is deﬁned without
stipulating an a-priori distorsion decomposition into elastic an plastic parts (which
does not exist, actually). The classical relationship between Bravais distortion and
dislocation densities, instead of being a deﬁnition, now appears as a result taking its
origin from the meso-scale analysis. Moreover, the torsion and contortion tensors,
which both describe the defective macroscopic crystal, are now properly understood
as averages of concentrated mesoscopic tensors. Since the latter are the diﬀerentials
(in an appropriate sense) of multivalued mesoscopic ﬁelds, we have shown how meso-
scopic multivaluedness is recovered in the geometric properties of the non-Riemannian
macroscopic crystal. In particular, in contrast with the mesoscale (where defects are
due to the multivaluedness of the rotation and displacement ﬁelds) the macroscopic
Burgers vector now appears as the commutator of a non-closed diﬀerential operator
related to the body torsion.
Extension to the 3D case is under investigation. Here, the handling of non-rectilinear
curves will be required in the framework of the geometric-measure theory. This should
eventually make it possible to consider a set of defect curves, freely occupying the crys-
tal with possible intersections and accumulation regions-forming so-called dislocation
clusters.

In this and the following sections, functions of the complex variable Z = x + iy and
its conjugate Z are now introduced. Remembering that, compared to holomorphic
functions, analytical functions may be multivalued it is easily seen that given two
analytic functions f and g, all real functions of the form

A.2 Second group of solutions: vertical displacement ﬁeld
Another solution concerns the particular case where u⋆
α = 0, noting that each solution
of 2D elasticity can be decomposed into a purely planar and a purely vertical solution.
In fact, since stress equilibrium shows that
(λ + µ)∂i∂ju⋆

it is easy to infer for i = z that

The function h′(Z) must be uniform. The complex rotation is

h′(Z).

In 2D isothermal linear elasticity without body forces, every displacement solution has
planar components given by Eq. (A.6) and a vertical component given by Eq. (A.7)
while the rotation vector has planar components given by Eq. (A.9) and a vertical
component given by Eq. (A.7) (Sokolnikoﬀ (1946) and Knopp (1996)).

A.3 The three 2D examples of rectilinear defects

In this section we consider two typical multivalued analytic functions log(Z) and
Zlog(Z). Starting from the general uniform strain expressions Eq. (A.5) or Eq. (A.8)
it is easily observed that any of the holomorphic functions f ′′ (with ℜ{f ′} single-
valued), g′′ and h′ can provide a solution to the 2D problem. Since these functions
can be expanded in Laurent series:

with a−1 real in order that ℜ{f ′} be uniform. The relevant cases are those which give
rise to a dislocation or a disclination, i.e. such that the functions f , f ′, g′, ℜ{h} or
ℑ{f ′} are multivalued. Hence, in order to obtain non-vanishing rotation or displace-
ment jumps, one needs to consider the following cases:

It should immediately be noted that Ω⋆ vanishes identically since h′ cannot be mul-

solutions are given by the following proposition.

Proposition A.1 For a straight defect line L in 2D elasticity, there are no more than
three distinct defect classes. The two dislocation classes are the screw dislocation with
a vertical Burgers vectors B⋆
z , as generated by the analytical function h (f = g = 0),
and the edge dislocation with a planar complex Burgers vector B⋆
y , as generated
by the analytical function g (f = h = 0). There is a single class of disclinations,
the wedge disclination, which has a vertical Frank vector Ω⋆
z and is generated by the
analytical function f (g = h = 0). These functions are:

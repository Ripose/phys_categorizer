Noether’s theorem in classical mechanics revisited

1. Introduction

Noether’s[1] theorem, presented in 1918, is one of the most beautiful theorems in physics.
It relates symmetries of a theory with its laws of conservation. Many modern textbooks
on quantum ﬁeld theory present a pedagogical version of the theorem where its power is
demonstrated. The interested reader is referred to the detailed discussion due to Hill[2].
Despite the great generality of this theorem, few authors present its version for classical
mechanics. See for examle the work of Desloge and Karcch[3] using an approach inspired
in the work of Lovelock and Hund[4]. Several authors demonstrate Noether’s theorem
starting from the invariance of the Lagrangian [5][6], but in this case it is not possible
to obtain the energy conservation law in a natural way.

In this article, the theorem is proved imposing invariance of the action under
inﬁnitesimal transformation, openning the possibility to extend the Noether’s theorem
in classical mechanics to include the energy conservation.

In section 2, the Euler-Lagrange equation is rederived.

In section 3 Noether’s
theorem is proved, in section 4 several applications are presented and in section 5 the
Noether’s theorem is extended and the energy conservation obtained.

2. The Euler-Lagrange Equations

We rederive the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion for sake of completness and to
introduced notation.

Let us consider a system of particles with n degrees of freedom whose generalized
coordinates and velocities are, respectively, q and ˙q, characterized by the Lagrangian
L(q, ˙q, t), where q is short hand for q1(t), q2(t), . . . , qn(t), with the dot representing the
total time derivative. When necessary for clariﬁcation, the explicit time dependence will
be displayed. This simple system is used in order to place in evidence the main features
of Noether’s theorem.

The most general formulation of mechanics is through the principle of least action
or Hamilton’s principle[7, 8]: the motion of the system from ﬁxed time t1 to t2 is such
that the action integral
t2

S =

L(q, ˙q,t)dt

t1

Z

is an minimum ‡ for the path q(t) of motion. In other words, the variation of the action
δS is zero for this path
t2

Using the variation of the Lagrangian in this equation results

δS =

δL(q, ˙q,t)dt = 0.

S be an extremum.

form of the variations in the coordinates and velocities in (2.3) are

The following should also be considered: as is well known, the action S is invariant
if we replace the Lagrangian, L, of the system by a new Lagrangian, L′, diﬀering from
the old one by the total time derivative of a function, g(q, t), dependent only on the
coordinates and the time. In fact, let us consider the new Lagrangian

L′ = L −

dg(q, t)

With the help of (2.11) we conclude that if the inﬁnitesimal transformation that
changes q to q + δq is such that the variation of the Lagrangian can be writenn as a
total time derivative of a function F :

then the action S is not aﬀected by the transformation i.e. δS = 0, and δq is a symmetry
of the action.

3. Noether’s Theorem

If the action of a given system is invariant under the inﬁnitesimal transformation that
changes q to q + δq, then, corresponding to this transformation there exist a law of
conservation, and the conserved quantity, J, can be obtained only from de Lagrangian
and the inﬁnitesimal transformation.

In fact, let us supose that the inﬁnitesimal transformation q′ = q +δq is a symmetry

of the action, then

4. Several applications of the theorem

We will examine three important cases of Noether’s theorem. The conservation
of momentum, angular momentum and the moviment of a particle in a constant
gravitational ﬁeld.
In the the next section we will extend the Noether’s theorem to
obtain the energy conservation.

4.1. Momentum conservation

Momentum conservation is obtained from the freedom we have to choose the origin of
the system of coordinates. Let us consider the Lagrangian of a free point particle of
mass m moving with velocity ˙x,

L =

m ˙xi ˙xi.

1
2
Under inﬁnitesimal space translation,
x′
i = xi + ai → δxi = ai,
˙x′
→ δ ˙xi = 0,
i = ˙xi

(

the variation of the Lagrangian becomes

δL =

δxi +

δ ˙xi = 0.

∂L
∂xi

∂L
∂ ˙xi

The ﬁrst term is zero because L does not depend on xi and the second is zero because
δ ˙xi = 0. In this case the variation of the Lagrangian can be put in the form of (2.14) if
we choose F equal a constant c. The Noether’s current then results

J =

δxi − c = m ˙xiai − c = const −→ piai = const.

(4.3)

∂L
∂ ˙xi

As the ai are arbitrary this is constant only if the momentum pi = const.

4.2. Angular momentum conservation

Angular momentum conservation is obtained from the freedom we have to choose the
orientation of the system of coordinates. Let us consider the Lagrangian of a free point
particle of mass m moving with velocity ˙x in a plane

L =

m ˙x2 +

m ˙y2.

Under inﬁnitesimal rotation θ,

x′ =
x + θy → δx = θy,
y′ = − sin θx + cos θy = −θx + y → δy = −θx

cos θx + sin θy =

and

(

(

˙x′ =
˙y′ = −θ ˙x + ˙y → δ ˙y = −θ ˙x,

˙x + θ ˙y → δ ˙x = θ ˙y,

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.4)

the variation of the Lagrangian becomes
∂L
∂y

∂L
∂x

δL =

∂L
∂ ˙x

δ ˙x +

δx +

∂L
∂ ˙y

δy +

δ ˙y = m ˙xθ ˙y + m ˙y(−θ ˙x) = 0.

(4.5)

Again the variation of the Lagrangian can be put in the form of (2.14) if we choose
F = c. The Noether’s current then results
∂L
∂ ˙x

δy − c = const −→ (xpy − ypx)θ = const.

∂L
∂ ˙y

δx +

(4.6)

J =

As the inﬁnitesimal angle θ is arbitrary, the expression inside the parentesis, witch is a
constant, can be recognized as the component Lz of the angular momentum.

Consider a particle in a constant gravitational ﬁeld described by the Lagrangian

4.3. A particle in a gravitational ﬁeld

Under inﬁnitesimal space transformation

m ˙z2 − mgz.

L =

z′ = z + a → δz = a → δ ˙z = 0.

The variation of the Lagrangian becomes
∂L
∂z

δL =

∂L
∂ ˙z

δz +

δ ˙z = −mga

The variation of the Lagrangian can be put in the form of (2.14) if we choose

F = −mgat.

The Noether’s current then results

J =

δz − F = m ˙za + mgat = const.

∂L
∂ ˙z

In the motion of a particle in a constant gravitational ﬁeld the quantity ˙z + gt wich is
the initial velocity is conserved.

5. Extension of the theorem

With the formalism of the preceding section it is not possible to obtain the energy
conservation. The reason comes from the fact that we have not yet deﬁned what we
mean by the variation, δt, in time, necessary to obtain the energy conservation. In order
to deﬁne the variation in time let us use another parametrization for the path described
by the particles. If we use a new parameter τ , the path q = q(t) can be writen

q = q(t(τ )) = Q(τ ),

t = T (τ ),

whose variations are

δq = q′(t(τ )) − q(t(τ )) = Q′(τ ) − Q(τ ) = δQ,
δt = T ′(τ ) − T (τ ) = δT.

5.1. Conservation of energy

Energy conservation is based on the freedom we have to choose the origin of the time.
Let us cosider, as in general is the case, a Lagrangian L(q, ˙q, t) not dependent explicitly
on time. Under an inﬁnitesimal time translation

q′ = q −→ δq = 0,

so, again, the variation of the Lagrangian can be put in the form of (2.14) if we choose
F = c. The conserved current

J =

(5.20)

∂L
∂ ˙qi

As ǫ is an arbitrary quantity, in order that J be constant H must be constant and can
be recognized as the energy of the system. In other words, if the Lagrangian is invariant
under time translation, then the energy is conserved.

6. Conclusion

The aim of this work was to present in a didatic way the Noether’s theorem in the
scope of Classical Mechanics. This theorem is not so important in Classical Mechanics
as it is in Field Theory, this is the reason that its didatic presentation generaly comes in
textbooks of Field Theory. Even in books that treat the theorem in Classical Mechanics,
such as Saletan[5] and Arnold[6], do not extend the theorem to include the case of energy
conservation.

We hope that this work can bring the main ideas of this theorem to undergraduate

students in a clear way.

We discuss the tightly bound (hydrino) solution of theKlein-Gordon equation for the Coulomb potential in 3 dimensions. We
show that a similar tightly bound state occurs for the Dirac equation for the Coulomb potential in 2 dimensions. These states
are unphysical since they disappear if the nuclear charge distribution is taken to have an arbitrarily small but non-zero radius.

I. THE HYDRINO STATE

expressed in terms of conﬂuent hypergeometric functions.
To see this take

Naudts [1] recently drew attention to the so-called hy-
drino state of hydrogen, a strongly bound state which has
a normalisable solution of the Klein-Gordon equation for
a Coulomb potential in three space dimensions, but no
analogue in the Schr¨odinger equation. It has been men-
tioned by a minority of quantum mechanics textbooks
in the past [2], which discard it for various ad hoc rea-
sons: for instance, because it lacks a nonrelativistic ana-
logue, or because it yields divergent expressions for the
expectation value of the potential energy. Claims that
a tightly-bound state of hydrogen exists have, however,
been widely publicised [3]. Another relativistic equation,
the Bethe-Salpeter equation, has been shown to have
anomalous solutions which on closer inspection are un-
physical [4].

In this letter, we show that similar anomalous tightly-
bound states for a Coulomb potential also exist in the
Dirac equation in two space dimensions. We claim that
all these anomalous states are unphysical by developing
an argument used by Schiﬀ [5], which was ﬁrst used by
Loudon [6] for the one dimensional Schr¨odinger equation
with the potential

α/

.

We shall begin with a brief discussion of the hydrino
α/r which is
state for the Coulomb potential V (r) =
taken to be the fourth component of a four-vector.
If
the solution ψ(r, θ, ϕ) for the Klein-Gordon equation of
a particle of mass m is separated out into its radial and
angular components in the usual way and we consider
only states of angular momentum l = 0, then if f (r) = rψ
we have (in natural units where ¯h = 1 = c)

It is

is tightly bound.

It is tempting to say with Migdal [8] that the one parti-
cle Klein-Gordon equation cannot be taken seriously and
ﬁeld theory is required. But we now demonstrate sim-
ilar tightly bound states for small α in the one-particle
Dirac equation, where tight binding should not cause a
problem [9].

II. THE COULOMB POTENTIAL IN THE

This problem has been discussed previously [10] and
anomalous solutions were noticed by Sigurdsson [11]. In
two space-dimensions we can take the gamma matrices
γx, γy and γ0 to be the Pauli matrices iσx, iσy and σz
respectively. Then the Dirac equation for a particle of
deﬁnite energy E in the presence of the potential V (r) =

III. DISCUSSION

We believe that the three dimensional Klein-Gordon
hydrino state and its two dimensional Dirac analogue
are unphysical in spite of having normalisable wave func-
tions. Their obvious failings are that

1. they lack non-relativistic counterparts even for ar-

bitrarily small coupling;

2. the states persist even when the coupling is turned

oﬀ;

3. the strength of the binding increases as the coupling
strength α decreases. The maximum binding oc-
curs for α = 0 when the potential has disappeared
completely1.

These reasons may be sound but they are not deci-
sive either mathematically or physically. We now demon-
strate that, if the point charge of the nucleus is replaced
by a charge extending over an arbitrarily small but ﬁnite
functions become unac-
radius R, then the anomalous
ceptable because for small enough R they cease to satisfy
the appropriate wave equation. We will prove this for the
Klein-Gordon equation; the argument for the Dirac case
runs similarly.

For simplicity, we look at a conducting spherical shell

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that there are normalisable solutions of
the Dirac equation for the Coulomb potential in two di-
mensions which are tightly bound, just like the hydrino
solution of the Klein-Gordon equation in three dimen-
sions. We have displayed the unphysical nature of such
solutions by smearing the nuclear charge distribution so
that it has an arbitrarily small non-zero radius; in that
case there are no anomalous solutions. We suggest that
outside of science ﬁction this is suﬃcient reason to dis-
regard them. We leave to others to ﬁnd a general crite-
rion to exclude the anomalous solutions for the Coulomb
potential with a point charge in two and three space di-
mensions: in the Appendix we indicate a possible route
to this end.

Acknowledgements I would like to thank Gabriel
Barton for suggesting that the Coulomb potential should
be cut oﬀ at small distances and showing me how to ma-
nipulate the conﬂuent hypergeometric functions. I would
also like to thank the referee for suggesting the insertion
of the Appendix.

V. APPENDIX

The requirement that wave functions have to be square
integrable is not the only restriction on physical states in
quantum mechanics. As de Castro has pointed out in his
study of Klein Gordon particles [13] for a similar prob-
lem, it is also necessary to ensure that the Hamiltonian
is Hermitian. We shall not attempt to do this here, but
a necessary consequence of Hermiticity will be that the
eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian corresponding to two
distinct energy eigenvalues are orthogonal.

The eigenfunctions f0(z) for the normal ground state
energy given by Eq. (6) and f0A(z) for the hydrino energy
given by Eq. (7) are similar. They are both of the form
given by Eq. (3):

f (z) = zµ+1/2e

−z/2w(z)

(35)

where in both cases w(z) = M (a, b, z) and a = 0;
i.e. w(z) is constant. Neither f0(z) nor f0A(z) van-
ishes except at z = 0. Hence the hydrino wave function
ψ0A = f0A(z)/r cannot be orthogonal to ψ0 = f0(z)/r.
Thus the hydrino state cannot be physical provided that
it is possible to ensure that the Hamiltonian for the hy-
drogen atom in the Klein-Gordon equation is Hermitian.

Abstract

The gedanken experiment of the clock paradox is solved exactly
using the general relativistic equations for a static homogeneous grav-
itational ﬁeld. We demonstrate that the general and special relativistic
clock paradox solutions are identical and in particular that they are
identical for ﬁnite acceleration. Practical expressions are obtained for
proper time and coordinate time by using the destination distance
as the key observable parameter. This solution provides a formal
demonstration of the identity between the special and general rela-
tivistic clock paradox with ﬁnite acceleration and where proper time
is assumed to be the same in both formalisms. By solving the equa-
tions of motion for a freely falling clock in a static homogeneous ﬁeld
elapsed times are calculated for realistic journeys to the stars.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many mathematical solutions to the clock paradox are based on the formal-
ism of special relativity. This solution parameterizes hyperbolic motion in
terms of the proper time of an accelerating clock [1]. For decades the solution
to the twin paradox, in terms of the formalism of general relativity, was also
parameterized in terms of this proper time. Using this parameterization the
general relativistic solution has been shown to be consistent with the spe-
cial relativistic solution in the limit of inﬁnite acceleration [2]. Recently the
clock paradox has been solved in the formalism of general relativity for ﬁnite
accelerations with the maximum relative velocity [3] as the parameter in the
solution. Here we demonstrate that the general and special relativistic clock
paradox solutions are identical with ﬁnite as well as inﬁnite acceleration by
using the destination distance as the key observable parameter.

Having reached its one hundredth anniversary the theory of relativity has
become a cornerstone of modern physics. One of the earliest challenges to
this theory was the clock paradox or twin paradox. While this paradox has
long been resolved it remains an excellent vehicle for the study of relativity
and in particular of the relationship between special and general relativity.
The clock paradox is described by a gedanken experiment using identical
twins with the ﬁrst twin remaining at home and the second twin accelerating
away and later returning. In order to describe a physically realistic trip the
accelerating twin’s journey will consist of four legs. During the ﬁrst leg the
twin travels in a space vehicle at a constant acceleration towards a distant
star. The second leg begins where the traveling twin reverses thrust with
constant deceleration. This deceleration causes the space ship to eventually
come to rest relative to the distant star and the stay at home twin. The third
leg consists of constant acceleration back toward home. Finally the fourth
leg begins with constant deceleration and continues until the traveling twin
is reunited with the stay at home twin.

The principle of equivalence allows this journey to be examined from a
diﬀerent point of view [4]. From the perspective of the accelerating twin
the stay at home twin is moving in a static and homogeneous gravitational
ﬁeld (SHF). The equations of motion for a freely falling clock in this SHF,
can be solved in terms of the coordinate distance of the accelerated twin for
both leg 1 and 2 of the out going trip. With the destination distance in the
SHF as a parameter, the two solutions can then be connected to obtain the
elapsed time for a complete trip. Using coordinate distance as the parameter

a coordinate transformation to a Lorentz inertial frame makes it possible to
evaluate elapsed times and distances for realistic trips to the stars.

2 STATIC HOMOGENEOUS FIELD

Following Einstein’s development of the equivalence principle [4] [5] the ac-
celeration experienced by the traveling twin is indistinguishable from station
keeping (remaining motionless) in a gravitational ﬁeld. From this perspective
the traveling twin is station keeping while the stay at home twin falls freely
in the ﬁeld. Consider an orthogonal coordinate system with the gravitational
ﬁeld parallel to the z-axis. During the ﬁrst and forth legs of the trip the ﬁeld
points in the negative direction. During the second and third legs the ﬁeld
is reversed and points in the positive direction.

The metric of a homogeneous ﬁeld will be static and unchanged by coor-
dinate transformations in any plane perpendicular to the acceleration. Under
these conditions all derivatives in the ﬁeld equations are zero except those
parallel to the acceleration (z axis). This allows the metric for a SHF to be
written in the form,

Consider the situation in which a test particle begins at rest at the ori-
gin and falls freely. The accelerating twin can be considered to be holding
position at the origin. This twin’s clock measures coordinate time. A clock
that falls freely with the test particle can be identiﬁed with the stay at home
twin. The equations of motion are obtained from the geodesic equations [6]

Next we will solve Eq. (20) for the ﬁrst leg of the gedanken experiment.
During the ﬁrst leg the falling twin begins at the origin and at rest making
K = 1. With this the solution to Eq. (20) is

This result can then be substituted into Eq. (18) to obtain

It is noteworthy that this solution to the ﬁeld equations has a vanishing
Riemann tensor as shown by Desloge [11]. This vanishing of the Riemann
tensor would be expected from the symmetry of the Rindler line element
[6], which is indistinguishable from a 2-dimensional problem, and following
Weinberg [6] cannot be associated with a ”true gravitational ﬁeld”. From
physical considerations this is perhaps not surprising since there can be no
physically real source for a homogeneous gravitational ﬁeld.

3 ROUND TRIP IN A STATIC HOMOGE-

NEOUS FIELD

In order to calculate the full round-trip time the equations of motion for the
second leg must be obtained. The constant of motion for this leg can be
determined by observing that the falling clock comes to rest when it reaches
a maximum distance in the SHF. Figure 1 is a plot of legs one and two for
the outbound trip. Notice that the falling clock comes to rest at a maximum
distance D. With this K = (1 + D) in Eq. (20).

The equations of motion for leg two can be derived by the same method
as the ﬁrst leg with the exception that the acceleration has the opposite

sign and the initial conditions must match the position, velocity, proper and
coordinate time at the end of the ﬁrst leg. The equations obtained in this
way are

where the last two expressions in Eq. (27) are mathematically equal due to a

trip time because there is a one-to-one correspondence between velocity and
position for the outbound and inbound trips, thus the total round-trip time
is twice these values.

The gedanken experiment of the clock paradox can also be solved within the
formalism of special relativity [1] [7] . Following Misner et al [1] assign to the

Capital letters are used for the coordinates to distinguish these from the
general relativity solution. The proper time in these equations is the time
of a clock moving with the accelerated twin [1]. The proper time for the
accelerated twin is the same as coordinate time (station keeping clock) in
the SHF Eq. (27), by the equivalence principle. Substituting Eq. (27) into
Eqs. (28) and (29) the equations for the outbound trip distance and time for
the stay at home twin can be written as

5 ELAPSED TIME AND DISTANCE IN A

LORENTZ INERTIAL FRAME

The clock paradox gedanken experiment has been solved here using the des-
tination trip distance in the SHF as the parameter. This permits a simple
coordinate transformation from the SHF to a Lorentz inertial frame (LIF)
at the end of leg 2 where the twins are comoving with the destination star.
This transformation can be written as

Eqs. (32) and (33) can be shown to be the correct transformation from the

Figure 2 provides a plot of elapsed times and distances in both the SHF
and LIF for distances up to D = 0.8. In this Figure the outbound coordinate
time in the LIF has been plotted from Eq. (32). The round-trip proper time
is plotted in the same Figure as 2 times Eq. (26). Examination of this plot
indicates that the outbound coordinate time in the LIF is greater than the
round-trip proper time in the SHF for a one way trip distance greater than
D = 0.56 and Louutbound = 2.6. The magnitude of the minimum distance for
this to occur can also be found analytically by setting 2 times Eq. (26) equal
to Eq. (32)

Figure 3 provides a plot of elapsed times in the SHF and for distances
in the LIF up to D = 16. In order to ﬁt the one-way distance in the plot
Loutbound has been divided by 100. Examination of this plot indicates that
for distance greater than Loutbound = 2, 500 the time diﬀerences between the
stay at home and the accelerating twin become appreciable.

The plot of Figure 3 extends to a distance that is

1/10 the distance from
the earth to the center of the Milky Way galaxy (assuming an acceleration of
g = 1). At this distance the time diﬀerence between the two twins is about
20 years. However, it would seem that the ﬁrst generation to achieve this
107 star systems in this time
sustained acceleration would have access to
interval.

6 CONCLUSIONS

The gedanken experiment of the clock paradox has been solved exactly, by
parameterizing the solution in terms of the maximum trip distance. The
solution was arrived at independently using the formalisms of special and
general relativity and these solutions are shown to be identical. We have
also shown that for a one-way trip of suﬃcient distance the outbound trip
coordinate time in the LIF is greater than the round-trip proper time in the
SHF. Transforming the maximum trip distance and one-way elapsed time in
the SHF to a LIF the elapsed times and distances for realistic journeys to
the stars were calculated.

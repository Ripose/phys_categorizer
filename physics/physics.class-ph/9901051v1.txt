ONE-DIMENSIONAL CENTRAL-FORCE PROBLEM
FOR SOMMERFELD SPHERE
IN CLASSICAL ELECTRODYNAMICS:
SOME NUMERICAL RESULTS

Equation of motion of Sommerfeld sphere in the ﬁeld of Coulomb center is
numerically investigated. It is shown that contrary to Lorentz-Dirac equation
in the attractive case there are physical solutions. In the repulsive case sphere
gains much more energy then that should be according to relativistic equation of
motion of point charge without radiation force.

03.50.De

Numerical calculations of head-on collisions of two point charged particles
in classical electrodynamics with retardation and radiation reaction show many
interesting properties of Lorentz-Dirac equation [1-6].

Among them are:
(P.1) absence of physical trajectory in the attractive case - for ﬁnite initial
values of position, energy and acceleration point charge stops before it reaches
the Coulomb center of the opposite sign and then turns back and moves away
to inﬁnity with velocity growing up to that of light [1,4,6];

(P.2) in the repulsive case point charge can gain velocity, after the turning
point, much more greater then that follows from the relativistic equations of
motion without radiation force [4].

These and other eﬀects (among them is the eﬀect of preacceleration) cause

much doubt in validity of standard approach to radiation reaction.

In literature one can ﬁnd the opinion that only consistent quantum theory

can solve all problems of radiation reaction [7];

but also one can ﬁnd the point of view that the problems lie in the ﬁrst
principles of classical theory, for example, in the notion of ”point” particle
(quantum theory only rewrites classical problems in another language), and for
”extended” (in some sense) particles the situation will be diﬀerent [8-11].

From the latter point of view it is interesting to consider how the above
results of numerical calculations change for ”extended”, not ”point-like” charges.
For this sake lets consider the famous Sommerfeld model of extended charge with
self-action.

Long time ago in Sommerfeld works [12, see also 9,13] was derived the expres-

1

sion of self-force acting on ”nonrelativistically rigid charged sphere”, i.e sphere
with radius a, its center moving along trajectory ~R(t), with total charge Q and
charge density (in laboratory reference frame)

ρ(t, ~r) =

Q
4πa2 δ(|~r − ~R| − a).

(One can treat this model in the following way: one builds the uniformly charged
sphere in laboratory reference frame and then begins it to accelerate in the way
that the charge density in laboratory frame is described by the above equation
while in sphere self-frame charge density can be calculated by standard tensor
coordinate transformations.)

In the case of shell rectilinear motion this force has the form [9]

here cT ± = 2a±L±, L± = |R(t)−R(t−T ±)|, L = |R(t)−R(t−T )|, β = |v|/c.

The total shell equation of motion then will be

(γv) = Fself

Here m - is the ”mechanical” shell mass.

This equation has one trivial solution - the uniform motion without radiation:

R(t) = R0 + vt.

Introducing dimensionless variables y = R/2a, x = ct/2a one can rewrite

the shell equation of motion (2) in the form

A.
We integrated eq.(4,5) in the repulsive case numerically with the following

initial data:

(i) Coulomb center is placed at y = 0.0;
(ii) initial value of sphere center of mass is y = −5.0;
(iii) initial sphere velocities dy
−0.1 ( i.e. in direction from the center; ﬁg. A.1);

dx are

0.0 (ﬁg.A.2);
+0.1 (i.e. in direction towards the center; ﬁg.A.3).

Numerical results are shown on ﬁgs. (A.1-A.3):
curve vz(x) corresponds to velocity of Sommerfeld sphere;
curve vq(x) correspond to velocity of point charge moving without radiation

reaction in the Coulomb ﬁeld;

velocity is vertical axis; horizontal axis is x;
arrows ⇑ ; ⇒ indicate the maximums in magnitude of sphere acceleration.
One can see that there are the following main properties of motion of Som-

merfeld sphere:

(A.1) sphere gains velocity much more greater then that should be according

to relativistic equation of motion of point charge without radiation reaction;

(A.2) magnitude of sphere acceleration has its maximum not in the point
of sphere closest approach to the repulsive center (as it is for the case of point
charge without radiation reaction), but some times after.

The result (A.1) one can explain in the spirit of notion of ”bounded” elec-
tromagnetic energy, introduced in works [14,15]: while radiating, the charged
object loses part of its total energy (- ”bounded energy”) and thus becomes
”lighter” (as energy is proportional to total eﬀective mass).

The result (A.2) one can explain as simple consequence of eﬀect of retarda-

tion.

initial data:

B.
In the attractive case we numerically intergated eq.(4,5) with the following

(i) Coulomb center placed at y = 0.0;
(ii) initial value of sphere center of mass is y = −1.0;
(iii) initial sphere velocity dy
Numerical results are shown on ﬁg. (B.1):
curve vz(x) corresponds to velocity of Sommerfeld sphere (integration is
carried up to the moment of time when the sphere touches the center, i.e. for
|y| > 0.5);

dx is 0.0.

curve vq(x) corresponds to velocity of point charge moving without radiation

reaction in the Coulomb ﬁeld.

One can see that Sommerfeld sphere indeed falls on the Coulomb center, that
is there is physical trajectory contrary to the motion of point charge governed
by Lorentz-Dirac equation.

Thus we conclude that extended radiating object can solve problem P.1 of
Lorentz-Dirac approach, while problem P.2 can be reasonably interpreted. This
happens thanks to the fact that equations of motion of extended objects are not
analytic near the zero value of their size (a = 0) and thus equations with a = 0
and a → 0 are essentially diﬀerent equations with diﬀerent physical solutions.

I am glad to thank my colleagues:
P.A.Polyakov - for theoretical discussions;
V.A.Iljina and P.K.Silaev - for assistance rendered during numerical calcu-

lations.

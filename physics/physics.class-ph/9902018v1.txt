Equation of motion of Sommerfeld sphere in the one-dimensional potential
hole, produced by two equal charges ﬁxed at some distance from each other, is
numerically investigated. Unusual result is found: due to the fact that sphere
gains much more velocity then it should be according to relativistic equation of
motion of point charge without radiation force, the sphere on its motion from
one wall of the hole to the other ﬁnds itself on more higher energy level then
the initial. Thus the sphere can jump out from a hole (contrary to the classical
motion of point charge without radiation reaction) if its depth is limited in value.

Here we continue our numerical investigation of one-dimensional motion of
Sommerfeld sphere with total charge Q, mechanical mass m, radius a and center-
of-mass coordinate R [1].

We consider the one-dimensional motion in the symmetrical potential hole,
produced by Coulomb ﬁelds of two equal point charges Q ﬁxed at distance 2D
from each other (Coulomb ﬁeld has one important property - it generates the
force, acting on the sphere, of the same value as if the charge of the sphere was
concentrated at its center).

For dimensionless variables y = R/2a, x = ct/2a, d = D/2a the equation

of motion of the sphere is

We integrated eq.(1,2) numerically with the following initial data:

which is constant for point-particle motion (E(x) is conserved quantity for eq.(2)
and is equal for our initial data approximately to 2.0 ) but essentially varies
during motion of Sommerfeld sphere.

One can see that there is the following main property of motion of Sommer-

feld sphere:

as the sphere gains velocity much more greater then it should be according
to relativistic equation of motion of point charge without radiation reaction (see
also the results of numerical calculations in [1]), the sphere on its motion from
one wall of the hole towards the other climbs on more higher energy level than
the initial.

Thus the sphere can jump out from a hole if its depth is limited in value.
This result conﬁrms the results of the works [2,3] where were discovered
the eﬀects of ”pumping” of extended object in the potential hole [3] (on the

2

example of some model in classical ﬁeld theory) and of ”classical tunneling” [2]
(considered for Lorentz-Dirac equation for point particle; we understand that
”classical tunneling” and the ”jump out” from the potential hole are eﬀects of
the same origin).

We see that these unusual (from point of view of classical mechanics) results
are not the distinguishing features of ”point-like” description of charged parti-
cles but reﬂect the general properties of equations with retardation (diﬀerence-
diﬀerential equations).

I am glad to thank my colleagues:
P.A.Polyakov - for theoretical discussions;
V.A.Iljina and P.K.Silaev - for assistance rendered during numerical calcu-

lations.

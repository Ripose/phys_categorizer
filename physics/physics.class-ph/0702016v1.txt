Abstract

The electromagnetic momentum of a point electric dipole in a uniform
magnetic ﬁeld of strength B0 of inﬁnite extent is equal to B0 × p/4, i.e.,
to half the electromagnetic momentum of a macroscopic dipole of electric
moment p in the same ﬁeld.

This result is obtained using three different methods which provide a test
of the internal consistency of electrodynamics with regard to the handling of
complicated singularities in the potentials, ﬁelds, and sources.

Introduction

As recently recalled by Jackson [1] and McDonald [2], for systems in which effects
of radiation and of retardation can be ignored, the electromagnetic momentum can
be calculated in various equivalent ways,

where ρ is the electric charge density, A is the magnetic vector potential (in the
Coulomb gauge where ∇ · A = 0), E is the electric ﬁeld, B is the magnetic
ﬁeld strength, φ is the electric (scalar) potential, J is the transverse (or solenoidal)
electric current density ( i.e., ∇ · J = 0), and c is the speed of light (which we take
as c = 1 in the sequel).

In reference [2] these expressions were used to calculate the electromagnetic
momentum of a capacitor in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld of strength B0 to obtain a
result contradicting intuition, namely that this momentum is only half of the naive
estimate of E0 × B0 V /4π based on Eq. (1.2) where E0 is the electric ﬁeld at
the center of the capacitor of volume V . Moreover, in reference [2] it was shown
that evaluating expressions (1.1–1.3) is difﬁcult, and not without ambiguities. In
fact, only one example was found for which Eqs. (1.1–1.3) gave the same result:
a spherical capacitor surrounded by a sphere of large radius on which there exist a
surface current density that varies as K = 3B0 × ˆr/8π where ˆr is the unit vector
from the center of the sphere.

In this paper we show that the electromagnetic momentum of a point electric
dipole in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld can be consistently calculated for the three
equivalent forms (1.1–1.3) using the methods presented in reference [3]. These
methods allow a straightforward calculation which presents no real difﬁculties,
including for the evaluations of the products of the δ and Υ-functions which are
made according to Colombeau’s theory of generalised function [4]. (As will be
recalled below, the generalised function Υ speciﬁes how to differentiate at the
position of the singularities in order to properly obtain the δ-functions which arise
when calculating the ﬁelds and currents according to Maxwell’s equations.)

The interest of calculating the electromagnetic momentum of a point electric
dipole in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld is not just to show that such a system has a
“hidden” electromagnetic momentum even though it is a static charge distribu-
tion combined with steady electric currents:
that calculation conﬁrms that the
electromagnetic ﬁelds of point singularities have to be supplemented by δ-like
contributions which cannot be neglected in the general case.

For example, as shown by Jackson, the complete magnetic ﬁeld strength of a

point magnetic dipole of magnetic moment m is [5, p.184]

~Bd(~r) =

m
r3 (cid:17)
where the δ-like term is essential in calculating the hyperﬁne splitting of atomic
states [6].

r × (m × r)
r4

r
r5 (m · r) −

Υ(r) +

(cid:16)

δ(r),

(1.4)

Similarly, as shown in [3], in problems where the singularity at the position of
a point charge is essential, the Coulomb ﬁeld of an electric pole of charge q must
be replaced by Tangherlini’s ﬁeld [7, p. 511–513]

r

where the δ-function contribution is a classical counterpart of the singularity

responsible of the Lamb shift in quantum electrodynamics [8, p. 294], as well
as an essential contribution insuring the local conservation of the charge-current
density of a generally accelerated point charge [9].

Finally, the complete ﬁeld of an electric point dipole (which is also called
‘dimonopole’ to stress that its distributional properties are radically different from
those of an intrinsic magnetic dipole) of moment p = qd, where d is the inﬁnites-
imal vector separating the positions of two poles of charge ±q, is

which contains the δ-function contribution discussed by Jackson in [5, p.141].
This is the dimomopolar electric ﬁeld considered in this paper, together with the
corresponding potential and current density, i.e., in their complete form [3]

r · p

r4 δ(r).

(1.6)

(1.7)

(1.8)

In this paper it will be seen that the δ-function term in (1.6), as well as
the corresponding singularities in the potential and current, are indispensable for
obtaining the correct result using (1.1–1.3). Moreover, it will be seen that these
δ-function terms (as well as those for the magnetic dipole (1.4)) can be related to
Tangherlini’s correction to the Coulomb ﬁeld (1.5), so that all these singular terms
are closely related to each other and of equal necessity for the internal consistency
of electrodynamics.

The plan of this paper is as follows: In section 2 we evaluate (1.1–1.3) using
the customary formulations of the ﬁelds, that is the formulations of the electric
dipole and of the constant magnetic ﬁeld ignoring the Υ-functions. It will be found
that the results from (1.1–1.3) differ from one another.

In section 3 we calculate the potential and current density of a uniform magnetic
ﬁeld B0 according to the methods of reference [3]. It will be seen that despite of
being constant and uniform (apart from a very weak singularity), this ﬁeld leads
to a non-zero current density.

In section 4, expressions (1.1–1.3) are calculated using the complete form of

all ﬁelds.

In section 5 the results of the previous section are extended to the case where the
region of uniform magnetic ﬁeld B0 is of ﬁnite spatial extent, while the magnetic
ﬁeld out of that region falls to zero at inﬁnity.

3

In section 6 the singularities of the electric and magnetic dipolar ﬁelds are

related to Tangherlini’s correction to the Coulomb potential.

Finally, in section 7, we end with a brief discussion of the broader implications

of our results.

2 Customary formulation

In this section we evaluate equations (1.1–1.3) using for the electric dipole the
usual expressions for its potential, ﬁeld, and charge density, namely

which contain no Υ or δ singularities except in the source charge distribution.
Similarly, we take for the potential, ﬁeld, and current density of the uniform
magnetic ﬁeld the standard expressions

ϕdm(r) = q

Edm(r) = 3

ρdm(r) =

The zero result for PFurry was of course expected since j = 0, while that of
PPoynting is due to the cancellation between the two terms of (2.2) after angular
integration. However, if we included the δ-function term that is present in Edm(r)
as in (1.6), we ﬁnd, with the help of formulas (2.8) and (2.9),

PPoynting =

B0 × p.

This non-zero result is encouraging because it differs from (2.10) by only a factor
4/3, and because it corresponds to Eq. (13) of reference [2], that is to the electro-
magnetic moment of a spherical capacitor in a constant magnetic ﬁeld of inﬁnite
extent, which in the limit of zero radius is a macroscopic conﬁguration equiva-
lent to a point electric dipole in the same ﬁeld. Nevertheless, the results from
equations (2.10–2.13) still disagree, which is why we proceed to a mathematically
more consistent calculation.

3 Full characterisation of a uniform magnetic ﬁeld

As is explained in reference [3] the defect of the vector potential (2.4) is that the
meaning of r is ambiguous at r = 0 in a polar coordinate system: when r shrinks
to a zero length along a line passing through the origin it has to turn 180 degrees
in order to start increasing again on the other side of the origin. That means that
there is a discontinuity at r = 0, which can be properly taken care of by rewriting
(2.4) as

A = −

r × B0Υ(r),

where Υ(r) has the properties

which are similar to those of Heaviside’s step function, even though Υ(0) 6= H(0).

Using the differentiation rule (3.2), one can calculate the magnetic ﬁeld B =

∇ × A corresponding to (3.1), which leads to

B = B0Υ(r) −

ˆr(ˆr · B0) − B0

rδ(r).

(3.4)

2 (cid:16)

(cid:17)

This ﬁeld strength differs from the identically constant ﬁeld (2.5) by two very
“weak” singularities:
the Υ factor which according to (3.3) is absorbed in an
integration over r, and the product rδ(r) which is also zero in such an integration
(and which for that reason is often erroneously identically identiﬁed to zero).

The source current density is then obtained by calculating the rotational of
(3.4) and dividing by 4π, which after some elementary vector algebra (and the use
of the formula δ′ = −δ/r) yields

j = −

ˆr × B0δ(r).

8π

(3.5)

This volume current density has a simple interpretation: it corresponds to a surface
current density over a sphere of radius zero producing a uniform magnetic ﬁeld
within the whole three-dimensional space. When integrated over the full space
this current density yields a total current that is zero after either an angular or a
radial integration. This is consistent with B being constant almost everywhere
except at a point of zero Lebesgue measure [10], i.e., at the origin.

We now turn to the gauge, which has to be that of Coulomb for equations (1.1)
and (1.3) to be applicable. This was the case with the customary potential (2.4),
and is still the case with the potential (3.1) because Υ is a function of r only so
that ∇ · A = 0. However, there is a difference: suppose we make a translation
r → r + a where a is a constant vector, then

∇ · A(r + a) = −

ˆr · a × B0δ(r),

(3.6)

which is zero if and only if a = 0. Thus, the Coulomb gauge implies that the origin
of the vector potential must be the same as that of the coordinate system, which
makes sense because it is the only special point available. Moreover, contrary
to the customary potential (2.4), the potential (3.1) including the Υ function is
unique in the sense that the position of the singularity of the potential cannot be
moved arbitrarily. Finally, as a consequence of being in the Coulomb gauge, we
can verify that j is transverse, which is indeed the case.

4 Electromagnetic momentum

Having derived the proper distributional form of the ﬁelds associated with the
uniform ﬁeld B0, we can now calculate the electromagnetic momentum for a
point electric dimonopole whose ﬁelds are deﬁned by equations (1.6–1.8).
In
doing so we are going to explain in detail every step of the calculation — not
that it is difﬁcult, but because it involves evaluating products and squares of
the generalised functions Υ and δ, which are only deﬁned in a generalisation of
Schwarz’s distribution theory such as the Colombeau algebra (see my introductory
paper [4] and references therein, as well as the recent review papers [11] and [12]).

However, for the purpose of the present calculation, the only thing that has to
be known about Colombeau generalised functions is that each of these functions
correspond to one of the inﬁnitely many generalised functions which in Schwarz’s
theory correspond to “one” distribution, that is to the equivalence class of the
Colombeau functions which deﬁne that distribution. For example, as shown in
[13], the Υ and δ functions to be used in electrodynamics correspond to the
Colombeau functions υ8 and δ8 which apart from the deﬁning properties (2.9) and
(3.2-3.3) have the additional properties

which are the only one that will be needed here. Hence, in the remainder of the
paper, we will replace Υ and δ by υ8 and δ8 when calculating integrals in which their
products appear as in (4.1) and (4.2).

4.3 Poynting’s expression: equation (1.2)

To calculate Poynting’s expression we ﬁrst rewrite the dipolar electric ﬁeld (1.6)
as

Edm =

(3Υ − rδ)(ˆr · p)ˆr − Υp

,

and the magnetic ﬁeld (3.4) as

B =

(Υ −

rδ) +

rδ(ˆr · B0)ˆr)

Inserting these two expressions in (1.2) we get, after multiplying the big parenthe-
ses, three terms since ˆr × ˆr = 0, i.e.,

Upon angular integration the third term gives zero since it is odd in ˆr, the second
one gives a factor 4π since it is a function of r only, and the ﬁrst one can be
integrated using (2.8). The radial integraal is therefore

In this section we show that the singularities of the electric and magnetic dipolar
ﬁelds are related to Tangherlini’s correction to the Coulomb potential.

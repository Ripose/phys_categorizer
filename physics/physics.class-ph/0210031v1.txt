A special kind of quasi-homogeneity occurring in thermodynamic potentials of standard thermo-

dynamics is pointed out. Some formal consequences are also discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Quasi-homogeneous functions have been introduced in the framework of standard thermodynamics with the aim to
studying scaling and universality near the critical point [1,2]. A common synonymous of “quasi-homogeneous function”
is “generalized homogeneous function” [see e.g. [1,2,3]]. We wish to point out here that quasi-homogeneity can be
an useful tool in the framework of standard thermodynamics, when one considers intensive variables as independent
In fact, homogeneity for the fundamental
variables for the equilibrium thermodynamics description of a system.
equation in the entropy representation [and in the energy representation] is well-deﬁned in terms of the standard
Euler theorem for homogeneous functions [4]. One simply deﬁnes the standard Euler operator (sometimes called also
Liouville operator) and requires the entropy [energy] to be an homogeneous function of degree one. When the other
thermodynamic potentials which are obtained from the entropy [energy] are taken into account by means of suitable
Legendre transformations, then part of the independent variables are intensive [4]. The thermodynamic potentials are
still homogeneous of degree one in the extensive independent variables, but a diﬀerent rescaling is appropriate for the
independent variables. For example, let us consider the Gibbs potential G(T, p, N ) for a system which is described
by means of three independent variables T, p, N . G is homogeneous of degree one when the system is rescaled by λ,
such a rescaling corresponding only to a rescaling N → λN , because T and p are intensive and remain unchanged
under rescaling of the system. This is evident because, as it is well known, one has G = µ(p, T )N , where µ is the
chemical potential. Actually, one could also deﬁne G as a quasi-homogeneous function of degree one with weights
(0, 0, 1). Then the behavior under scaling is better deﬁned. A mathematical treatment of the same problem is found
in Ref. [5]. The approach we present here is characterized by the more general setting allowed by the technology of
quasi-homogeneous functions; the sections on the Gibbs-Duhem equation and the on Pfaﬃan forms contain a further
analysis of some formal aspects of standard thermodynamics.

II. QUASI-HOMOGENEOUS FUNCTIONS AND THERMODYNAMICS

Given a set of real coordinates x1, . . . , xn and a set of weights α ≡ (α1, . . . , αn) ∈ IRn, a function F (x1, . . . , xn) is

quasi-homogeneous of degree r and type α [6] if, under dilatations by a scale factor λ > 0 one ﬁnds

A diﬀerentiable quasi-homogeneous function satisﬁes a generalized Euler identity:

F (λα1 x1, . . . , λα1 xn) = λr F (x1, . . . , xn).

where D is the Euler vector ﬁeld

D F = r F,

D ≡ α1 x1 ∂

Notice that (2) is a necessary and suﬃcient condition for a diﬀerentiable function to be quasi-homogeneous [6]. It is
also interesting to deﬁne quasi-homogeneous Pfaﬀain forms. A Pfaﬃan form

is quasi-homogeneous of degree r ∈ IR if, under the scaling

one ﬁnds

ω =

ωi(x) dxi

n

i=1
X

x1, . . . , xn → λα1 x1, . . . , λαn xn

ω → λr ω.

This happens if and only if the degree of quasi-homogeneity deg(ωi(x)) of ωi(x) is such that deg(ωi(x)) = r − αi ∀i =
1, . . . , n. For a discussion about quasi-homogeneity and for further references, see [7].

A. quasi-homogeneous potentials in standard thermodynamics

Let us consider a thermodynamic potential R(y1, . . . , yk, xk+1, . . . , xn) depending on k intensive variables y1, . . . , yk

and n − k extensive variables xk+1, . . . , xn. R is required to be quasi-homogeneous of degree 1 and its type is

Then, one has

).

This expression of the thermodynamic potentials is well-known, it is sometimes referred to as the identity satisﬁed
by the potentials at ﬁxed intensive variables [8]. A treatment on a mathematical ground of the same topic is found
in Ref. [5]. It is evident that, in order to ensure that R is a degree one quasi-homogeneous function, the intensive
variables can be at most n − 1, in which case (cf. also the following section)

R = xn ∂R
∂xn

≡ xn r(y1, . . . , yn−1),

where r(y1, . . . , yn−1) is of degree zero.
We recall that, given the fundamental equation of thermodynamics in the energy [entropy] representation, one can
obtain other fundamental equations by means of the Legendre transform [4]. It is easy to show that:

the Legendre transform with respect to a variable of weight α of a quasi-homogeneous function of degree r is a quasi-
homogeneous function of degree r with the weight α changed into the weight r − α of the Legendre-conjugate variable
(theorem 2 of [1]).

Moreover,

the partial derivative with respect to a variable of weight α of a quasi-homogeneous function R of degree r is a quasi-
homogeneous function of degree r − α having the same type as R (theorem 1 of [1]). See also [7].

These results allow to justify easily the following examples.
For the free energy F (T, V, N ), one has F = U − T S, thus F is a quasi-homogeneous function of degree 1 and of
weights (0, 1, 1), and

F (T, V, N ) = V

Analogously,

[In fact, S = −∂F/∂T and theorem 1 of [1] can be applied]. Moreover, given S(T, p, N ), one has

In concluding this section, we point out that the distinction between degree and weights of thermodynamic variables is
somehow artiﬁcial, a degree becoming a weight if the thermodynamic variable is changed into an independent variable
(e.g., the degree zero of the pressure becomes a weight zero when p is an independent variable).

Herein we take into account the Gibbs-Duhem equations. Cf. also [5]. Let us deﬁne

On the other hand, one obtains from (8)

The GD equation is then

This equation is related with the quasy-homogeneity symmetry of the potential. Let us deﬁne the Euler operator

a=1
X

where Ra are quasi-homogeneous functions of degree one X Ra = Ra and the Ri are quasi-homogeneous functions of
degree zero X Ri = 0. Then ωR is a quasi-homogeneous 1-form of degree one, in the sense that it satisﬁes LX ωR = ωR,
where LX is the Lie derivative associated with X. One can also deﬁne a function

where iX is the standard contraction operator. As a consequence, one ﬁnds

dR = d(iX ωR) = −iX dωR + LX ωR = −iX dωR + ωR

If ωR is a closed 1-form (and then, exact in the convex thermodynamic domain), then dωR = 0 and dR = ωR, i.e. R
is the potential associated with ωR. Notice also that in the latter case one ﬁnds

R ≡ iX ωR,

The converse is also true, i.e., if (21) is satisﬁed then from (20) follows that ωR is closed.
The GD equation is then satisﬁed because of the equality of the mixed second derivatives of R (Schwartz theorem)
and because of the quasi-homogeneous symmetry. In fact, by deﬁning Qαβ the matrix of the second partial derivatives
of R, one ﬁnds

IV. PFAFFIAN FORM δQrev

Let us consider the Pfaﬃan form δQrev for a system described by (T, V, N ), where T is the absolute temperature;

one has

δQrev = CV N (T )dT + a(T, V, N )dV + b(T, V, N )dN.

δQrev has to be integrable, i.e., it satisﬁes δQrev ∧ d(δQrev) = 0, and it is known that T is an integrating factor for
δQrev, with

δQrev
T

= dS.

Then, one ﬁnds that

is exact and a potential is given by

δQrev

b(T, V, N )

S =

Notice that the quasi-homogeneity of degree one of S is the tool allowing to obtain this result. It is “trivial” that S
is the potential associated with δQrev/T , it is less trivial that its “homogeneity” leads to (33). For a proof, see the
appendix. δQrev is quasi-homogeneous of degree one and weights (0, 1, 1). From the theory of quasi-homogeneous
integrable Pfaﬃan forms [7], it is known that an integrating factor is also given by

f = a(T, V, N ) V + b(T, V, N ) N.

The proof is found in Ref. [7]. It is evident that

Analogously, one can consider (T, p, N ) as independent variables

f = T S.

δQrev = CpN (T )dT + η(T, p, N )dp + ζ(T, p, N )dN,

in which case

f = ζ(T, p) N = T S.

Classical Analytical Mechanics and Entropy Production

J. Silverberg and A. Widom
Physics Department, Northeastern University, Boston MA 02115

The usual canonical Hamiltonian or Lagrangian formalism of classical mechanics applied to macro-
scopic systems describes energy conserving adiabatic motion. If irreversible diabatic processes are
to be included, then the law of increasing entropy must also be considered. The notion of entropy
then enters into the general classical mechanical formalism. The resulting general formulation and
its physical consequences are explored.

INTRODUCTION

In typical macroscopic classical mechanics problems,
one deals with Hamiltonians describing a few degrees of
freedom, say (P, Q) = (P1, . . . , Pn, Q1, . . . , Qn). From
a microscopic viewpoint, the Hamiltonian contains an
enormous number of degrees of freedom, say N ∼ 1023.
To derive the macroscopic Hamiltonian from the mi-
croscopic Hamiltonian requires the notion of thermody-
namic entropy. In detail, suppose a microscopic Hamil-
tonian H(P, Q, p, q) wherein (p, q) represent microscopic
degrees of freedom. Discrete degrees of freedom are left
implicit. For ﬁxed classical macroscopic values for the
reduced degrees of freedom (P, Q), one may consider the
quantum microscopic energy eigenvalue problem [1]

The thermodynamic entropy is determined by the micro-
scopic degeneracy via the Boltzmann-Gibbs law [2]

S(E, P, Q) = kB ln Ω(E, P, Q).

In principle, Eq.(2) may be solved for the energy in the

friction force components (f1, . . . , fn) determine the cou-
pled equations of motion

T ˙S = − ˙Qafa ≥ 0.

(4)

To assure an increasing entropy, the friction force com-
ponents must be opposite to the velocity components.
While the heating rate due to frictional forces T ˙S is pos-
itive, energy is nevertheless strictly conserved, i.e.

˙E ≡ ˙H = 0

(5)

In Sec.IV, well known cases of friction are discussed.
The friction term is then generalized to a function of
coordinates and velocities as fa = −R(Q, ˙Q)va, and the
consequences are explored.

In Sec.V the example of the underdamped simple har-
monic oscillator is considered. It is used as an pedaga-
logical demonstration in the calculation purely thermod-
unamic quantities such as temperature as fucntions of
time for the formalism considered herein.

II. ADIABATIC PROCESSES

yielding the classical macroscopic Hamiltonian which is
now an explicit function of entropy. Our purpose is to
consider the physical consequences of including the en-
tropy in classical canonical dynamics.

In Sec.II, we consider the adiabatic classical dynamics
of macroscopic systems. Since the entropy S is uniform in
time for adiabatic dynamics, the usual Hamiltonian and
Lagrangian dynamics holds true, albeit with a macro-
scopic Lagrangian L( ˙Q, Q, S) which also explicitly de-
pends on entropy. In adiabatic classical mechanics, both
entropy and energy are conserved.

In Sec.III, we explore the consequences of diabatic pro-
cesses wherein the entropy is increasing. In accordance
with the ﬁrst and second laws of thermodynamics the
system energy is still conserved albeit some of the energy
is converted into heat precisely deﬁned by the increase in

In an adiabatic process, the system entropy is uniform

in time

˙S = 0.

(6)

In general, the ﬁrst and second laws of thermodynamics
may be written in the form [3]

dH = V adPa − FadQa + T dS,

V a(P.Q, S) =

Fa(P.Q, S) = −

∂H(P, Q, S)
∂Pa
∂H(P, Q, S)
∂Qa
∂H(P, Q, S)
∂S

,

,

T (P, Q, S) =

(7)

wherein the Einstein summation convention over index
a is being employed, and T is the system temperature.
Adiabatic macroscopic Hamiltonian dynamics is of the
usual classical form

˙Qa = V a(P.Q, S),

˙Pa = Fa(P.Q, S) and ˙S = 0.

(8)

To obtain the equivalent Lagrangian form of the equa-

tions of motion, note that

is equivalent to the condition that frictional forces pro-
duce heat according to the entropy rule

T ˙S = −fa ˙Qa.

The components of the frictional force fa (a = 1 . . . n)
will oppose the direction of motion ˙Qa
(a = 1 . . . n)
giving rise to the second law of thermodynamics in the
form

L = −H + V aPa.

(9)

˙S ≥ 0.

(18)

Eqs.(7), (8) and (9) imply

dL = Pad ˙Qa + FadQa − T dS.

The system temperature in the Lagrangian representa-
tion follows from Eq.(10) according to

The equations of motion in Lagrangian form with dia-
batic processes can be found by extending Eq.(11) to the
case wherein ˙S 6= 0. This may be done by directly adding
the frictional forces to Lagrange’s equations, which now

follows directly from Eqs.(11).

Both energy and entropy are conserved during a classi-
cal adiabatic motion. When forces of friction are present,
the energy is still conserved but the entropy increases
with time in agreement with the ﬁrst and second laws of
thermodynamics. Let us see how this comes about.

grangian,

E = E(Q, ˙Q, S),

(cid:19)

E = ˙Qa

may be shown, via Eqs.(10) and (19), to be consistent
with

E = H(P, Q, S)
dE = ˙QadPa − FadQa + T dS.

III. DIABATIC PROCESSES

Our purpose is to derive the rule of conservation of
energy in the presence of frictional forces. Starting from
the Hamiltonian deﬁnition of energy E = H(P, Q, S),
one may compute the time derivative

˙E =

∂H
∂Pa

˙Pa +

∂H

˙Qa +

˙S.

Employing the energy conservation Eq.(16) and the di-
abatic Lagrange’s Eq.(20), one again ﬁnds the heating
rate

T ˙S = −fa ˙Qa.

The above considerations show that the same rule for
entropy production follows from both the Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian formalisms.

(14)

Employing Eq.(4) for frictional forces yields

IV. THE GENERAL FRICTION FUNCTION

˙E = ˙Qa ˙Pa + (− ˙Pa + fa) ˙Qa + T ˙S = fa ˙Qa + T ˙S.

(15)

Energy conservation in the form

˙E = 0,

(16)

We now examine in more detail the generalized fric-
tional force fa. In theory and experiment, it is known
that friction is generally a complicated phenomenon re-
quiring regime-speciﬁc models and free phenomenology

parameters [4] [5]. For example, consider the diﬀerences
between dry friction, viscous drag and atmospheric re-
entry. Respectively, the dissipative force is constant, lin-
ear and quadratic in velocity. Given this assortment of
possibilities, a general approach must have enough ﬂexi-
bility to describe a wide range of phenomena while still
conforming to certain physically intuitive notions. It is
clear that any friction force would oppose the direction
of velocity. It should also depend on the generalized co-
ordinates such that the expressions involve tensors under
arbitrary coordinate transformation; e.g.

with an entropy production of

wherein γ < ω0.

x = x0e

−γt cos(Ωt + φ) wherein Ω =

V. THE UNDERDAMPENED OSCILLATOR

Let us illustrate for a simple soluble model how the
thermodynamic variables may change in time along with
the purely mechanical variables. For this purpose we con-
sider the underdamped simple harmonic oscillator. The
Lagrangian is

where the oscillation quality factor Q = (ω0/γ). We have
plotted both the damped harmonic oscillator coordinate
and the the temperature increase ∆T in Fig.1 above as an
illustration of how thermodynamic parameters as func-
tions of time can be calculated similarly to computations
of ordinary mechanical coordinates.

VI. CONCLUSION

The classical formalism of mechanics was extended to
also include consideration of entropy. The results allowed
for a revised form of Lagrange’s and Hamilton’s equa-
tions which necessarily included energy dissipation due
to frictional forces. It was shown that when the frictional

forces vanished, that the entropy production was also 0
and classical results were reproduced. However, in the di-
abatic cases, the law of energy conservation gave rise to
the conventional condition of entropy production in both
the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian frameworks. A simple
example was then considered and worked out in detail
where the rate of entropy production was connection to
the heating rate. The explicit connection between the
motion of a body and the rise in temperature was shown
in closed analytical form. A more complicated problem
such as the entry into the atmosphere and burn of a me-
teorite can in principle be treated by the methods here
discussed although analytical solutions would appear un-
likely.

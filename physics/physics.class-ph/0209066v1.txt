Abstract. – From the principle of maximum entropy for a closed system in thermal equi-
librium, it is shown for the ﬁrst instance, to exist a clear relation between total entropy S (in
terms of arrangements of particles) and the classical expression for the force acting on a particle
in a rotating frame. We determine relationships between arrangement of particles and force in
the case of the gravitational and elastic forces.

Introduction. – The notion of entropic force has been successfully applied to an increasing
number of problems, e.g., to the calculation of forces acting at the ends of a single Gaussian
macromolecule [1], the evocation of the geometric features of a surface as creating entropic
force ﬁelds [2], and the attractive Coulomb force between defects of opposite type [3]. The
purpose of the present paper is to present a new and unusual procedure, using a thermody-
namical and mechanical framework, to obtain the (entropic) force acting over a particle in a
rotating frame in terms of arrangement of particles.

Extremum Principle. – As is known, from Liouville theorem it is deduced the existence
of seven independent additives integrals: the energy, 3 components of the linear momentum
~p and 3 components of the angular momentum ~L. Let us consider an isolated macroscopic
system S composed by N inﬁnitesimal macroscopic subsystems S′ (with an internal structure
possessing a great number of degrees of freedom, allowing the deﬁnition of an entropy) with
Ei, ~pi and ~Li, all constituted of particles of a single species of mass m. The internal energy
Ui of each subsystem moving with momentum −→p i in a Galilean frame of reference is given by

The entropy of the system is the sum of the entropy of each subsystems (and function of the
their internal energy U , S = S(U )):

At thermodynamic equilibrium the total entropy of the body has a maximum taking into

The entropic force. –

In the frame of the guiding principle brieﬂy introduced [7], our
main goal is to investigate if the information content of the entropy provides a knowledge of
the motion of a system.

Usually it is used the relationship dU = T dS − frdr − fθdθ − fzdz (and interpreting here

the d′ as an exterior derivative [4]) to obtain (along a given direction v)

On the above expression has its roots a kind of ”entropic force” [1, 5]:

~∇U v = T ~∇ ¯Sv − ~f .

We will write, instead of eq.( 7), the ﬁrst and second principle combined in a diﬀerential form

It is noteworthy to introduce a factor of T
2 , instead of T , to each degree of freedom. This
procedure is necessary to eliminate a factor 2 which appear in front of the acceleration term.
It means the scale of the ”thermometer” is calibrated so as to give a number T

This procedure is necessary to warrant the Equipartition Theorem [6] (see also Sect. 4.1).

Further on, for concreteness and simplicity, we consider a moving particle in a plane
perpendicular to ~eω. In this case a simple calculation shows that the ﬁrst term on the (right
hand side) RHS of eq.( 9) leads to

We conclude that the outlined information-theoretic formalism is able to deduce the clas-
sical force in a rotating frame (and hence Newton’s second law); it makes the prediction that
the gradient of entropy when multiplied by T
2 gives rise to a macroscopic force. We see that
considering entropy as our primordial concept and with no arbitrary assumptions, it results
conceptual and mathematical simpliﬁcation.

Nevertheless, this classical force was obtained in a restrictive context that invokes a particle
trajectory along an isentropic regime, obviously a limiting case of the behavior of matter. A
new and very interesting physical situation could be explored considering a dynamical process
in which a particle or system of particles evolves in nonequilibrium conditions.

The outlined argument could be reversed and allow the build up of a strategy to relate

the force capturing the key properties of statistical ensembles.

For this purpose it is convenient to introduce the phase space Γ of the system consisting in
N particles occupying a volume V and energy between E and E + ∆ (in the microcanonical

4

ensemble). Each point on Γ represents a state of the system and the locus of all points in Γ
satisfying H(p, q) = E deﬁnes the energy surface of energy E. The volume in Γ space occupied
by the microcanonical ensemble is

Forces embed in microstates: an elementary approach. –

If a macroscopic system is
subject to an entropic force identiﬁed as the classical force under thermal equilibrium, it is
legitimate to revert the argument and examine whether some microstates provides support
for the existence of referenced kinds of forces. This question is illustrate subsequently.

Gravitational attraction. – Imagine a particle describing a circular motion at a distance
r away from the origin of a central force. The number of conﬁgurations in space associated
with r is Ω = 4πr2. Applying eq.( 8) the entropic force results to be

Notice that the term of mass was introduced via Equipartition theorem. From this the ex-
pression for the force becomes (unfortunately, the symbol for period and absolute temperature
are identical)

Elastic spring. – The restoring force in a piece of stretched rubber can be interpreted
in terms of a freely orientating Gaussian macromolecules containing N segments without
volume, each with equal length l and remaining at a vector distance ~r.
It can be shown
that the number of diﬀerent molecular conﬁgurations which are likely to occur is given by

This is the ﬁrst approximation of a restoring force. Normally, as resulting from the law of
elastic deformation (Hooke’s law) f = −kr and so the elastic constant should depend on the
temperature as well as on structural parameter of the spring.

Conclusion. – The principle of maximum entropy and its mathematical model is a
promising tool for treatment of new physical problems. Here, it was presented an unusual
method to show that the classical force acting on a particle of mass m in a rotating frame (and
hence Newton’s second law) can be obtained making use of the entropy concept. Particle’s
portrayal in space-time issues from the interrelationship of processes and information. This
procedure could provide a direction toward an amazingly rich subject.

I wish to thank Prof. Paulo S´a for critical reading of the manuscript.

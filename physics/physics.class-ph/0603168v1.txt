Mass, Time, and Clock (Twin) Paradox in
Relativity Theory

Anatoli Vankov,
Bethany College, KS, anatolivankov@hotmail.com

Abstract

Historically, Einstein’s Special Relativity Theory (SRT) came to
reconcile the Galilean principle of relativity of inertial motion with the
empirical fact of constancy of the speed of light in inertial coordinate
systems. As a result, a classical (Galilean) coordinate transforma-
tion was replaced by the Lorentz transformation of 4-position and
4-momentum vectors in Minkowski space. This is the main content
of SRT Kinematics, physical principles of which are clear and self-
consistent. However, in many SRT applications questions arise con-
cerning physical interpretation of geometrical structure of Minkowski
space and proper/improper quantities resulted from Lorentz trans-
formations. Often, poor or even wrong popular presentation of SRT
concepts contribute to confusions and controversies especially when a
problem formulation and/or its solution requires gaining an insight
into theory physical foundations and beyond. The so-called clock
(twin) paradox is an example of this kind of problem, disputed over
years in literature; in diﬀerent publications it was ill-posed in formu-
lation, and/or ill-treated in solutions. The paper is intended to clarify
operational meaning of mass and time quantities as main character-
istics of an atomic clock, which is considered a quantum oscillator in
association with the de Broglie wave concept. The speciﬁcation of the
concept of clock in quantum terms reﬂects the idea of relativistic mass
and time complementarity, which is important for avoiding ambiguity
of such notions as “time rate”, “time record”, and “elapsed time” un-
der relativistic conditions. We used this approach in SRT Kinematics
to conduct a detailed analysis of the clock paradox; results are dis-
cussed. It is also shown that in SRT Dynamics the proper mass must
be acted by Minkowski force, what results in a clock rate variation.

1 Introduction

Special Relativity Theory (SRT) in its basic part, Kinematics, was formulated
by Albert Einstein in 1905 to reconcile Kinematics of Newtonian Mechanics
with Electromagnetism in view of empirical evidence of constancy of the
speed of light in all inertial frames. In both Newtonian and SRT Kinematics,
the Galilean postulate of relativity of motion holds. However, SRT is a
more general theory: given the postulate of the speed of light constancy,
reduction of Lorentz to Galilean coordinate transformations is achieved with
quadratic in β terms neglected. Unlike Newtonian Mechanics, SRT deals
with point particles. However, it is not a theory shortcoming but rather its
advantage because it enables us to recognize particle-wave duality of matter
and establish SRT quantum connections by introducing a concept of atomic
clock as a quantum oscillator.

±

Mathematically SRT is a simple theory, but its consequences may be con-
fusing for an Euclidean mind. There are numerous claims in “non-mainstream”
literature that the postulates are wrong; ad hoc hypotheses are made ad-
mitting particle motion in Minkowski space faster than light. Empirical
materials from time to time are presented allegedly revealing SRT inherent
contradictions. For example, from observations of light from moving stars
(or a radio echo from moving planets), it was found that the formula of ve-
v) rather than speed of light constancy ﬁts the data.
locity addition (c0
In this case, a confusion is caused by misunderstanding of SRT postulate of
speed of light constancy. The speed can be measured in diﬀerent inertial
frames by the method of time of ﬂight, the idea of which is, as follows. One
should have a rigid movable frame with two thin transparent ﬁlms, detectors
of light, ﬁxed at points A and B with a separation d. A light source should
be attached to another movable frame. The speed of light c = d/t can be
tA where tA and
determined from measurements of a time interval t = tB −
tB are moments of light passages through detectors. Experiments show that
the speed of light does not depend on whether the two frames are at rest or
in a relative motion. The procedure of observations of light coming from a
moving source is diﬀerent; it is described by the Lorentz transformation of a
4-position vector of a photon moving in x-direction and having a coordinate
v)t, where t is a time of light travel and v is a speed of relative

motion. The formula is, indeed, consistent with a classical photon model of
aberration and Doppler eﬀects (slow motion conditions) and observations.
The addition (c0 + v) in Lorenz transformations does not mean a motion
with a speed exceeding the speed of light. Contrarily, it says that due to
the speed of light constancy, the time of light propagation (before it hit a
target) depends on a direction of relative motion: an event can be advanced
or delayed. However, in classical mechanics, one may interprete the formula
as if a superluminal motion is possible.

The addition (c0

v) seems to cause confusions as well in work[1] devoted
to “reinterpretation” of Einstein’s illustration of relativity of simultaneity. At
c0
, time becomes the absolute Newtonian time and a simultaneity of
two events becomes absolute, while in the SRT approximation of slow motion,
predictions of all eﬀects linear in β, including the one of relativity of simul-
taneity, remain consistent with observations to the precision of second and
higher order terms. Thus, the idea of Einstein’s imaginary train/embankment
experiment is right and has a pedagogical value as far as it shows the rela-
tivity of simultaneity in prerelativistic (Galilean) Kinematics before actual
introducing the relativity theory.

Under relativistic conditions of high-speed motion, another kind of con-
troversies arises, ﬁrst of all, in the connection with proper/improper catego-
rization of physical quantities. This issue turned out to be the main problem
in analysis of the so-called clock (twin) paradox widely known from fairy-tales
about cosmic travelers getting younger by ﬂying back and forth.

In the paper, much attention is paid to operational interpretations of
SRT concepts in the imaginary experiment methodolology around the main
topic formulated in the title: mass, time, and the clock (twin) paradox in
relativity theory. The concept of time in Minkowski space is closely related
to the concept of atomic clock, a quantum oscillator, mysteriously driven
by proper mass. One may consider a point particle in Minkowski space a
quantum oscillator and a light emitter/detector. In physical reality, particles
in motion by inertia do not exchange photons. Particle/particle interaction
and particle/wave duality is subject to speculations in current ﬁeld theories
where concepts of real and virtual photons in connection with de Broglie
waves are introduced. The present work is devoted to issues of SRT physical
foundations, while a ﬁeld theory problem is out of considerarion. It follows
from our discussions of space-time and 4-momentum space complementarity
that the de Broglie wave concept is originated in SRT Kinematics and plays
an important role in a clock (twin) paradox analysis in SRT Kinematics. An

3

excursion into SRT Dynamics was also made with the conclusion consistent
with observations that the proper mass should be subject to Minkowski force
action resulting in a clock rate variation.

2 Point Particle in Minkowski Space

2.1 Lorentz transformations

Let us begin with known facts about SRT Kinematics. A free point particle
in Minkowski space is characterized by a position 4-vector X µ = (X 0, X i),
µ = 0, 1, 2, 3 in an arbitrarily chosen coordinate system; X 0 = c0t is a time
(temporal) part, X i, (i = 1, 2, 3) are Cartesian 3-coordinates representing
a space (spatial) part of the vector; c0 is the speed of light in empty space.
According to the SRT postulates, all inertial reference frames are equivalent,
and the speed of light is constant in all of them. The position vector traces
a trajectory of particle motion (a world line), which is a straight one.
In
a rest frame, the vector takes the form X µ = (c0τ, 0, 0, 0) where τ is a
rest (proper) time distinct from the so-called coordinate (or improper) time
t. Thus, a world line of a rest particle coincides with X 0-axis. We shall see
β2)1/2 = t/γ. With the use of denotations of
that for a free particle τ = t(1
classical Cartesian coordinates X 1 = x, X 2 = y, X 3 = z, the position vector
can be written X µ = c0t(1, βi), where βi = V i/c0, and a 3-velocity vector
has components V 1 = vx = dx/dt, V 2 = vy = dy/dt, V 3 = vz = dz/dt. The
(x2 +y2+z2) (repeated upper
inner scalar product is deﬁned X µXµ = (c0t)2
and lower indeces summed up). It is said that the vector is constructed in
the metric signature sign convention (+,
), the quadratic metric
form being ds2 = dX µdXµ = (c0dt)2
β2), or
−
ds = c0dτ . The metric form is preserved (Lorentz invariant). The so-called
proper 4-velocity U µ = dX µ/ds is inttroduced, where ds = (dX µdXµ)1/2, and
U µ = (γ, γβi) is a tangent unit 4-vector with a squared length U µUµ = 1.
Wwith the above metric signature, vectors with a positive squared length
are called time-like vectors. The 4-momentum vector for a point particle of
a proper mass m0 is deﬁned P µ = m0U µ; its length (norm) is m0.

The question arises how to express an equation of particle inertial motion
in diﬀerent coordinate systems. One can consider a particle “instantaneous”
′ with axes x, y, z parallel to
image in two coordinate systems
and
x′, y′, z′, respectively, both systems being in relative motion in the x direc-

Newtonian Kinematics is achieved when the Galilean transformation of clas-
sical coordinates in the considered case x′ = x
t′ = t
is replaced by the corresponding (special) Lorentz transformation for space-
time 4-coordinates

There is the assumption in (1), (2) that coordinate origins O and O′ coincide
at t = t′ = 0 (a “null”, or 0-event, for short). So far, this concept looks
vague. It will be carefully examined later, when a conceptual diﬀerence be-
tween t and τ will be discussed. One could have already noticed that the t
in SRT plays the same role as that in Galilean Kinematics: multiplied by v,
it gives a distance traveled by a particle. A relativistic equation of motion
follows from the above transformations: x = vt, x′ =
vt′. For an arbitrar-
ily chosen direction of relative motion, there are so-called general Lorentz
transformations, (1), (2) being a particular case of them. Regardless of type,
Lorentz transformations establish one-to-one correspondence between two
coordinate systems of inertial (that is, not accelerating and not rotating)
reference frames.

−

Thus, any particle should be assigned 4-coordinates. Act of imaginary
(nob-perturbing) observation of the particle at some 4-point is called “an
event”. According to the Minkowski space concept, any event P in a parti-
cle history is separated from the 0-event by a 4-distance OP such that the
squared distance is a metric (quadratic) form invariant under the Lorentz
transformation. Metric invariance can be visualized geometrically. Denote
β = tanh φ, cosh φ = γ and sinh φ = γβ. Then the transformation can be

It should be noted that in the above formalism, the metric sign convention
is (+, +, +,
), and the time-like vector has a negative squared length, for
example, (U µUµ)1/2 =
1. Formally, (4) describes a rotation of a complex
plane X 1, X 4 at a purely imaginary angle ψ(β). Thus, Lorentz invariance of
Minkowski metric can be associated with a constant radius OP of imaginary
plane rotation. Another picture of the Lorentz βx-boost transformation can
be drawn as a diagram in a real (x, t) plane showing primed and unprimed
coordinate axes for diﬀerent β (sometimes it is called the Loedel diagram).
Here, there is no room for those diagrams: they are given in many textbooks
with explanations of geometrical treatments of relativistic eﬀects, such as the
time dilation and the length contraction.

γ2β2 = 1 (or equivalently cosh2 θ

There is a diﬀerence in a pattern of motion of particles and photons.
For particles, geometrical structure of Minkowski space is determined by the
time-like base vector U µ having the proper form U0 = (1, 0, 0, 0) in a rest
frame.
In a coordinate system where the particle is in uniform motion in
x-direction, the vector takes the improper form U µ = (γ, γβ, 0, 0). Of
course, β-boost transformations can be successive. Figuratively, we deal
with the SRT geometrical “skeleton” U µ designed in accordance with the
sinh2 θ = 1).
mathematical identity γ2
The spatial part U i is related to the 3-velocity space described by the so-
called Lobachevsky (hyperbolic) 3D geometry. In non-Euclidean terms, it is
characterized by a constant negative curvature. Consequently, the parallel
line axiom does not hold, and a classical velocity addition formula became
invalid. Physics begins with wrapping “the skeleton” in “ﬂesh”: one has to
multiply the U µ
0 by the proper time interval ∆τ0 or the proper (rest) mass
m0 (or some other proper scalars proportional to ∆τ0 or m0) to get space-
time or 4-momentum space, respectively. Another base 4-vector uµ having
an invariant null norm (uµuµ)1/2 = 0 is needed to describe a light ray (a
photon) propagation. For a photon in (x, y) plane, uµ = (1, cosθ, sin θ, 0).
A photon “skeleton” uµ is “wrapped” in a scalar “ﬂesh” similarly to U µ.

Two in a list of scalars seem to be special: mass and time. They give
rise to 4-momentum and 4-coordinate space, which we incline to consider
complementary. As is known, non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics provides
the 3-coordinate and 3-momentum complementary representation of objects
(states). The complementarity concept plays an important role in explana-
tion of Heisenberg uncertainty principle and, generally, Copenhagen school
philosophy. In relativistic theories, 3-coordinate and 3-momentum measure-
ments should be considered incomplete because of four dimensional nature

6

of quantities, while measurements of 4-vector norms lead to determination of
Plank constant. This follows from SRT quantum connections: hf0 = m0c2
0,
where m0 is proper mass of a particle (an atomic clock). The corresponding
proper frequency is proportional to the light frequency in the source frame
f0 = 1/∆τ0. A period ∆τ0 = 1/f0 can be considered a proper time interval
related to the time-like metric ∆s0 = c0∆τ0. Then a scalar product of vec-
tors ∆X µ and P µ = m0U µ is a Lorentz invariant quantity related to physical
constants:

P µ∆Xµ = h/c0

Let us introduce a proper time τ in the form τ = n∆τ0, where n is a number
of de Broglie wave fronts in the world line interval. Then the corresponding
improper time is t = n∆t = nγ∆τ0. As far as τ 2 is Lorentz invariant, the
number n (number of clock ticks) is Lorentz invariant as well. Indeed (putting
for a while c0 = 1, h = 1):

X µXµ = n2∆τ0

2, P µXµ = n

(5)

(6)

Those relations reﬂect complenentarity of 4-coordinate and 4-momentum vec-
tors.

The following comment may be helpful. In old terminology, a vector with
an upper running index is a contravariant vector while the one with repeated
lower index is a covariant vector, or co-vector. Nowadays the latter in scalar
products is often termed a 1-form (generally, N-form) studied in diﬀerential
geometry. In our case, the 1-form is associated with the de Broglie wave: the
dot-product gives a number indicating how many surfaces of equal phase are
pierced by the vector (see, for example, Misner [2]). In de Brogli wave terms,
the number manifests Lorentz invariance of the phase diﬀerence between
given end points in a particle world line. In physical applications, one should
take into account that a co-vector 3-direction is opposite to that of a vector.
An unalienable unity of mass and time concepts is seen from the fact that
a frequency of both an atomic clock (a quantum oscillator) and an emitted
photon is proportional to the mass of the quantum oscillator.

2.2 Treatment of proper/improper quantities in imag-

inary experiments

With the help of “imaginary observers” we are going to explore operational
frame and
meaning of Lorentz transformations. Let us consider Mary in

In general, a quantum

oscillator can play a role of standard (atomic) clock. It should function as a
photon emitter/detector characterized by a speciﬁc electromagnetic transi-
tion between two quantum levels (see, for example, Moller [3]). It could be a
single particle or a collective atomic system of suﬃciently small size, ideally,
a point particle. An information exchange between observers means that a
photon or a light ray emitted by one observer can be registered and analyzed
by another observer. Sometimes, one can speak about making photographic
light marks. The SRT concept of light (or photon) as an object in Minkowski
space is a special issue, discussed later.

We are interested in relativistic eﬀects such as the time dilation (retar-
dation) and the corresponding length contraction. It was earlier emphasized
that eﬀects termed “relativistic” are those of second and higher order in β,
(1 + β2/2) (appreciable when a particle speed is comparable with
as in γ
the speed of light). Technically, they are purely kinematical caused by the
dependence of a time unit on a reference frame choice. Philosophically, they
manifest a reconciliation of Galilean relativity principle with the postulate
of c0 constancy. The eﬀects readily follow from Lorentz transformations.

≈

In the ﬁrst imaginary experiment, John produced two short successive
ﬂashes at instants t′ = 0 and t′ = ∆t′
0 using his clock as a light emitter
located at the origin O′. Mary was to detect the ﬁrst signal at t = 0 by her
clock located at the origin (the 0-event) and the second signal at t = ∆t by
another clock at some point x > 0 when the clock “momentarily coincided”
with a location of John’s moving coordinate origin x′ = 0 (the concept of
“clock coincidence” will be discussed later). In accordance with (2), Mary
measured the improper time interval and compared it with the proper one:
∆t = γ∆t′
0. Of course, conditions are symmetrical: John could detect Mary’s
similar signals and ﬁnd ∆t′ = γ∆t0 bearing in mind that ∆t0 = ∆t′
0 and
∆t = ∆t′ by deﬁnitions of standard clocks and measurement procedure.
Thus, the improper time interval is always the factor γ greater than the
proper one. Though the term “time dilation” is often used, one compares
standard clock rates rather than time elapsed.

In the second imaginary experiment, John placed a standard rod with
its left and right ends at x′ = 0 and x′ = l′
0, correspondingly, and put
shining clocks there, signals from which Mary was supposed to detect at
t = 0 (simultaneously with the signal from the 0-event). It is crucial in the
length contraction concept that this is Mary, who detects simultaneously the

the relationship l = l′
0/γ takes place interpreted as the length contraction
eﬀect. Conversely, John could detect Mary’s similar signals and ﬁnd l′ = l0/γ
bearing in mind that l0 = l′
0 and l = l′ due to the symmetry of measurement
conditions. Thus, for any observer a moving rod appears shorter in the
direction of motion.

In practical (laboratory) experiments with high energy particles both
kinematical relativistic eﬀects are routinely observed and interpreted in terms
of Lorentz transformations. For example, unstable energetic particles of a
rest life-time t0 travel a distance proportional to the time of ﬂight t = γt0.
Next we shall see how improper quantities appear in the 4-momentum space
in connection with the photon exchange procedure.

3 Photon in Minkowski Space

3.1 Photon concept in SRT Kinematics

By applying the Lorentz transformation to photon vectors, one can learn
more about the photon exchange procedure, the 0-event concept, and rel-
′ (John) in
ativistic eﬀects. Let us again consider frames
the βx-boost formalism. We assume that x and x′ axes do not coincide but
can be however close. (Further, small characters uµ, xµ and pµ are used in
denotation of photon base vector, coordinates and momentum; as before,
classical denotations of Cartesian coordinates are x1 = x, x2 = y, x3 = z,
x0 = c0t). A photon emitted at t = 0 from the origin O in some direction ui
is characterized by a 4-coordinate vector xµ:

(Mary) and

xµ = (c0t, xi) = (c0t)uµ,

uiui = 1 (i = 1, 2, 3)

(7)

where uµ = dxµ/c0dt is a photon base 4-vector with spatial components
ui, directional cosines of light ray in the observer’s system: x = c0t cos θ,
y = c0t sin θ, z = 0. Because the speed of light is constant in all reference
frames, the photon vector uµ is a null 4-vector: uµuµ = 0; it determines
the null invariant metric: xµxµ = 0 , (∆s)2 = ∆xµ∆xµ = 0. A radius r of
spherical light wave and its squared interval (∆r)2 relate to the quadratic
metric form (∆s)2:

r2 = c2

0t2 = x2 + y2 + z2 ,

(∆s)2 = (∆t)2

(∆r)2 = 0

Thus, we have a light 3-sphere in a coordinate system where a light source
is at rest (say, in John’s frame); hence, a temporal component of x′µ is the
proper time t′

0 = t0:

x′µ = c0t0(1, cos θ′, sin θ′, 0)

The vector components in Mary’s frame follow from the inverse Lorentz trans-
formation

x = c0t cos θ = γc0t0(cos θ′ + β),

y = c0t sin θ = γc0t0 sin θ′

(11)

From (10) and (11), important consequences follow. The temporary com-
ponent, when mixed with the spatial part in a Lorentz transform, becomes
anisotropic: a light sphere in John’s frame r′ = c0t0 takes a form of el-
lipsoid in Mary’s frame. At cos θ′ =
1 the addition formula takes place
x = γ(c0
v)t for a slow motion. (This issue was discussed
v)t or x = (c0
in Introduction in connection with “confusions”). At cos θ′ = 0, one gets the
proper-improper time relationship t = γt0. Hence, the time dilation eﬀect
arises when a photon is sent perpendicularly to the direction of motion. This
result clariﬁes the concept of 0-event and “light photographic marks” in the
methodology of light signal exchange between observers (recall “imaginary
experiments”).

In accordance with (5) and (6), the improper time t is a sum of n wave pe-
riods related to atomic clock ticks: t = n∆t, where ∆t = 1/f . Consequently,
formulae (10-11) give us a description of light aberration and Doppler eﬀects.
A complete picture of relativistic eﬀects will be revealed from a consideration
of the problem in the momentum (complementary) space.

3.2 Aberration and Doppler eﬀect

To derive formulae for aberration and Doppler eﬀects, it is customary to
consider a wave propagation in a moving refracting medium under assump-
tion that the Huygens’ principle is consistent with SRT, and the phase is
invariant, Moller [3]. Instead, we are going to take advantage of the comple-
mentarity concept by considering the Lorentz transformations in the photon
4-momentum space. The 0-event in this case means that tails of 4-momentum
vectors in all reference frames are put in the same coordinate system origin.

10

A photon 4-momentum vector can be presented in diﬀerent forms. The
4-wave vector has momentum components divided by Plank constant h. At
the same time, the photon frequency vector is proportional to the momen-
tum one: pµ = hf µ/c0 where f 0 is the standard (one may call it proper)
frequency of the photon emitted by a standard atomic clock at rest; this fre-
quency is proportional to energy of a quantum oscillator m0c2

The inverse Lorentz transformation into Mary’s coordinate system gives
f µ = (f, f cos θ, f sin θ, 0) with components

f = γf0 + γβf0 cos θ′, f cos θ = γf0 cos θ′ + γβf0 , f sin θ = f0 sin θ′ (12)

The relativistic Doppler eﬀect is given by (13), while (14), (15) are relativis-
tic aberration formulae, which automatically take into account the Doppler
eﬀect. Recall that angles θ and θ′ are referred to the 3-vector u pointing
at the same out-going photon in Mary’s and John’s frames, correspondingly.
They are emission angles, interconnected by aberration formulae. The ob-
servation angle ˆθ = θ
π is characterized by the opposite vector pointing at
the in-going photon to be detected. The Doppler eﬀect is usually presented
in terms of 3-vectors w and u: f = f0/γ(1

u = β cos θ.

A process of relativistic eﬀect formation can be visualized with the help
of Fig. 1, where the Doppler eﬀect graph for β = 0.7 is plotted in polar
coordinates. Because there is a symmetry of rotation of the plane about an
x-axis, a wave-front circle, shown in the picture, is actually a 3-sphere in
John’s view, which appears to Mary as a stretched ellipsoid. There is also a
left-right reﬂection symmetry with respect to the central ellipsoid section. A

positive x-direction), while its image is observed at an angle θ.

It should be noted that a pair of vectors to be compared −−→OP ′ versus

systems related to the source and the detector, correspondingly, while the

of a photon momentum transfer from one to another reference frame.

3.3 Time dilation as transverse Doppler eﬀect

One can make a distinction between diﬀerent stages in the Doppler eﬀect
observation when the source moved, ﬁrst, towards the detector, and at some
moment passed it by, and then kept ﬂying away. Correspondingly, several
speciﬁc cases are shown in the picture, one of them presents the time dilation
eﬀect.

The ellipsoid becomes a sphere, and the proper/improper time diﬀerence dis-
appears. There is a price to be paid for accepting the approximation: in a
classical photon model, one can distinguish between the eﬀects caused by
motion of source and detector. That means that the approximation breaks
the symmetry of Galilean relative motion principle (in second order terms).
In this situation, the principle should be rescued, for example, by means of
an absolute ether of special properties. Historically, this idea was discarded
by experiments, though some physicists keep advocating it in a broader (cos-
mological) sense.

Nowadays, Einstein’s SRT Kinematics is considered the only consistent
theory of inertial motion world. An existence of ideal inertial frames is a
special issue of Newtonian and relativistic Physics; it is discussed in liter-
ature, especially in cosmological theories. A cosmic background radiation
seems to represent a preferred reference frame on a cosmological scale. In
this connection, there are speculations about a relativity principle violation,
which might appear in the form of “forbidden by SRT” frequency shift in
electromagnetic radiation from distant stars or from relativistic particles ac-
celerated in laboratories. So far, attempts to observe this kind of eﬀect failed,
for example, in a high-precision experiment [4], in which accelerated ions were
used as a light source. The experiment showed that under special conditions
when the relativistic Doppler eﬀect was compensated, the time dilation eﬀect
automatically disappeared. At present, it is well understood that the time
dilation is a part of the relativistic Doppler eﬀect; most reliable time dilation
tests were, in fact, high-precision Doppler eﬀect measurements. An absolute
impact of inertial motion on a time pace through time dilation is central in
the clock paradox further discussed.

4 Clock (Twin) Paradox

4.1 Clock paradox history and status

In the clock (twin) paradox, the attention is focused on a possible impact of
inertial motion on traveler’s age. Suppose Mary and John were twins, and
John went to a round trip while Mary stayed at home. What would be John’s
age in comparison with Mary’s at the end of the trip? The paradox arose
because the symmetry of observers’ conditions was seemingly broken by the
statement that John was in motion while Mary kept staying at rest. “The
round-trip condition” is a cause of confusion. Upon John’s return, clocks
were brought to the same place for comparison, and it was believed that his
wristwatch showed less amount of time than Mary’s: as everybody knows,
“a moving clock runs slower”.

It is not possible here to review the whole store of literature on the clock
paradox; we can only draw a general picture of the paradox status develop-
ment and confusions about it. Originally, the paradox was noted by Einstein
who expressed the opinion that a traveling twin might return back to Earth
“younger”. Einstein left details of the problem to generations. In the cen-
tennial course of the paradox studies, the problem has been overgrown with
numerous subtleties of minor or unknown importance. Meanwhile, exper-
iments with relativistic short-lived particled conﬁrmed the predicted time
dilation eﬀect in relativistic motion: they traveled longer distance than pre-
dicted by classical Physics. It was also evident that an acceleration did not
spoil the eﬀect, and it looks like a fast motion, indeed, “prolongs” a particle
life. A direct “clock comparison” (what is the essence of the paradox) cannot
be done in this type of experiments; hence, they are not informative in regard
to the paradox problem.

In another experiments, real atomic clocks were put into airplanes ﬂying
in diﬀerent directions and eventually brought back home to be compared
with “a master clock”. An estimated diﬀerence in clock records at-rest ver-
sus in-ﬂight was tiny on a background of numerous dominant disturbances
(gravitational force, Earth with atmosphere rotation, centripetal accelera-
tion, and others). For a practical speed of plane, an expected relative eﬀect
would be of order 10−13, which is very hard to separate from an experimental
noise and, what is even more important, from systematic errors due to model
corrections. For this reason, trustworthiness of such measurements could not
be high. So, we are left with logic of theory.

15

Theoretical studies of the clock paradox have been conducted by many
qualiﬁed physicists. In particular, the Doppler-shifted frequency as an ad-
ditional means of the time rate counting along clock world lines was mod-
eled. Some authors insisted that the problem had to be resolved only in the
GRT framework to account for acceleration/deceleration stages (for exam-
ple, Moller [3]). However, it was generally realized that those eﬀects can
be eliminated (for example, Pauli [5], recently Penrose [6]). During the 50s
and 60s, especially intense disputes between prominent physicists took place
over the paradox when two sides defended opposite views. Some scientists
took a stand on a brink of denying the SRT validity (see original materials
and further references in Tonnelat [7], Sartori [8] and elsewhere, also Internet
sites “Twin (clock) paradox” ). From Penrose [6] one can infer that the prob-
lem should be treated in terms of matter properties governed by geometrical
structure of Minkowski space, so the “answer” is readily found by inspection
of clock world lines. This diﬀerent viewpoint seems to be far from being
satisfactory because it suggests that one should accept the proper/improper
time relationship t = γt0 as a key formula for a paradox solution without
physical clariﬁcation.

A great variety of approaches to the paradox reﬂects diﬀerences (some-
times hidden) in its formulation. No wonder, diﬀerent solutions may come
out. At present, many physicists believe that the famous clock (twin) para-
dox academically does not exist, or it is “apparent”. In fact, inconsistencies
and contradictions in “solutions”, subject to earlier criticism, were swept un-
der a rug, while controversial statements about the paradox continue among
those involved in physical research and educational activity. A historical and
current importance of the paradox is evident from the fact that it raises ques-
tions related to SRT physical foundations and practical applications. Bearing
this in mind, we are going to present our detailed analysis of the problem in
parallel with criticism of its typical treatment.

4.2 Time and time record

In our view, controversies about the clock (twin) paradox basically arose
because of ambiguity in terms “an elapsed time” and “a clock record of
time” treated equivalently in literature but actually having diﬀerent physi-
cal meanings. Roughly speaking, suggested solutions reﬂected the idea that
“a moving clock runs slower than a rest one”: t = γt0. When a symmetry
of relative motion is broken by John’s forced turnaround, the time diﬀer-

16

−

t0(John) seems to become absolute. The objection to this
ence t(Mary)
approach is that “the moving, running slower clock”, that is showing the
improper (“elapsed”) time t, does not exist in Nature: the t quantity is a
theoretical relativistic concept related to a set of clocks along a line of motion,
as discussed next in details.

Let us ﬁx a proper distance AB = x0 of John’s travel with a relative speed
v from A to B under the assumption that shortly after he started and gained
a constant speed, both observers zeroed their clocks (the 0-event concept).
By adopting philosophy of eliminating the role of end point neighborhoods
in John’s world line, we make the theory applicable. In Mary’s (unprimed)
coordinate system, the improper time of one-way travel is t = x0/v. Be-
cause John observes the road of travel contracted, the improper length in his
(primed) coordinate system is x′ = x0/γ and the corresponding proper time
t′
0 = x0/γv. Observers must agree that measured proper/improper quantities
are diﬀerent purely because of a change of time/length units, but physically
play the same role when enter a speed formula in the asymmetric problem
formulation (Mary stays, John moves): v = x0/t = x′/t′
If a symmetry
0.
of Mary’s and John’s conditions is admitted, we have an additional formula
0/t′ = x/t0 (John stays, Mary moves). Thus, the clock paradox resolu-
v = x′
tion is a matter of proper/improper quantitiy interpetation at a conceptual
level.

In Relativity theory, the invariance of a world line length τ between two
points in Minkowski space is checked by the comparison of amount of clock
ticks n = τ /∆τ0, and n = t/∆t, where an atomic clock frequency f0 = 1/∆τ0
is an inner particle property related to the proper mass. Thus, the number n
must be Lorentz invariant. How to ﬁx end points and realize an information
(photon) exchange between two observers, was previously explained. The
basic idea of clock record of time was introduced in (5), (6), speciﬁcally,
concepts of “clock record of time” n0 = f t = f0t0 and “elapsed time” t. (We
denoted the proper time unit ∆t0, which can be chosen arbitrarily; the same
quantity will be denoted ∆τ0 when it is needed to emphasize that this is a
∆t0). It was also explained that more
particle inner property. So, ∆τ0
than one ckock is is needed to measure the impoper time. Consequently, in
Lorentz transformations the improper time t, technically, is a cumulative sum
of time intervals t =
t(xi) is a time diﬀerence
shown by pairs of synchronized standard clocks at neighboring points xi+1
and xi along the path AB (in Mary’s frame) in a process of tracking a single
(John’s) clock. Points xi are those, which were hit by John’s light signals

cumulative) time: t = n0∆t. John’s wristwatch will show the corresponding
0 = n0∆t′
cumulative (proper) time t′
0 along the same path AB. From the
Lorentz transformation, it follows ∆t′
0 = ∆t/γ. The ∆t′
0 determines n0 for a
ﬁxed interval t0 if a proper frequency f0 = 1/∆t0 is speciﬁed: n0 = t/∆t =
t0/∆t0. What if a frequency changes due to acceleration during some time
∆T f (t)dt
interval ∆T ? In this case, one should consider the integral ∆n =
R
and a criterion ∆n/n of contribution of end point intervals to a clock record of
travel time. A function f (t) is an issue of SRT Dynamics. This is the number
n, which is subject to comparison in the clock paradox. A comparison t versus
t0 is not correct: when ∆n/n

be diﬀerent variants of clock tick counts, when considering a world-line of
John’s motion.

Variant 1: One-to-one clock comparison. In this variant, axes x and x′
must coincide, and observers’ wristwatch records are directly compared by
counting light signals exchanged between the observers. A clock motion can
be reversed, for example, by a means of elastic reﬂection at end points, and
0-events can be determined there. In the ﬁrst world-line leg of the John’s trip
A
β) of John’s signal was detected
by Mary, a blue-shifted frequency fb = f0γ(1 + β) by Lily, and conversely
in the second leg B
A. The frequency shift was caused exclusively by a
longitudinal Doppler eﬀect, while the proper frequency f0 is related to the
improper one f = f0/γ (Case D in Fig. 1). Mary’s and Lily’s estimate of
John’s cumulative (improper) time of travel was t = n0∆t in each direction;
it is related to the corresponding proper time t′
0 measured by John
in each direction as well. (Recall, ∆t = γ∆t′
0 = ∆t0, f = 1/∆t).
It should be emphasized that Mary measured the improper time of John’s
round trip 2t (but not 2t0) in spite of the fact that in this case she used

d0 was determined by the time of light ﬂight method, in which a time of

B and B

In the considered variant, the one-leg time of tick collection by a sta-
tionary observer diﬀers from t: one needs to take into account a time delay
of John’s light signal. In addition to t, Mary had an extra time x0 to al-
low the last red-shifted wave front (reﬂected from the point B) to reach
her. Thus, the total time of Mary’s collection of red-shifted photons was
tr = x0 + x0/β = t(1 + β). Contrarily, Lily (at point B) had to wait a period
of time x0 to allow the ﬁrst blue-shifted wave front to reach her: tb = t(1
β).
One can see that the time record of photon collection (the number of detected
ticks) for both Mary and Lily is the same frtr = f t = n0 and fbtb = f t = n0.
The second leg of the trip was identical to the ﬁrst one because observers
just “exchanged their names” in counting procedures. For both observers,
the elapsed time of round-trip counting tr + tb was continuous and equal to a
total improper time 2t, a total time record being 2n0.

β)], where t′ = γt′

What about John? He was engaged in similar to stationary observers’
counting procedures: he received their blue and red shifted photons and
made counts in a course of photon collection over times tr and tb, cor-
In the ﬁrst leg, he counted Lily’s “blue photons”: fbtb =
respondingly.
[f0γ(1 + β)] [t′(1
0 is John’s improper time of outer ob-
server’ motion. At the same time, he counted Mary’s “red photons” with the
same result: fbtb = frtr = f0t0 = n0. In the second leg, photons from Mary
and Lily just “exchanged color”; the result remained the same. Thus, every-
body agreed on the clock record of time travel n0 and the elapsed (improper)
time of travel t = x0/β, resulting numbers doubled for a round trip. The
t and t0 quantities alone are not enough to compare twins’ aging without a
frequency analysis. Having the analysis done, twins would infer that their
aging is not aﬀected by a relative motion (provided, force eﬀects were taken
care of).

Variant 2: One-to-many clock comparison (axes x and x′ do not coin-
cide). According to the Lorentz transformation scheme, in each leg Mary
was supposed to detect the cumulative (improper) John’s travel time t using
a set of side clocks along the x-axis: t = n∆ti is a collection of time diﬀer-
ences calculated from records of neighboring clocks, as explained before. The

19

detected light signals suﬀered a red shift due to the transverse Doppler eﬀect
independent of direction of motion. In this variant, the elapsed time of travel
and the time of photon collection is the same quantity t = x0/β = n0∆t cor-
responding to the measured (improper) frequency f = 1/∆t, ∆t = γ∆t0. A
clock record of travel time would be f t = n0. Lily had the same result as
Mary due to symmetry of their conditions.

On the other hand, John used his wristwatch to detect a cumulative
(proper) time of travel in each leg t′
0 = n0∆t0. His clock record of one-
way travel time was f0t′
0 = n0 and doubled for the round trip. Observers
eventually would meet each other having their life calendar intact in any
variant (to the precision of acceleration eﬀects, which can be eliminated).
Next, we shall illustrate the clock paradox by graphical means as well.

4.4 World line and de Broglie waves

In connection with the clock paradox, it would be instructive to discuss
geometrical images of the world line, as shown in three diagrams (Fig 2)
β < 1, (c0 = 1). The diagram a) is
depicted for a positive x-direction, 0

known to illustrate “a world line” in accordance with “a light cone” concept
(as it is often presented in textbooks and SRT introductory lectures and
papers). A vertical x-axis stands for a distance traveled by John in Mary’s
coordinate system. A horizontal t-axis is Mary’s time such that x = βt,
∆x/∆t = tan α. One can draw a triangle

with vertices

time). A general idea of “proof” that John’s travel time record would be less
than Mary’s one is, as follows. In Euclidean geometry, side lengths satisfy

In our view, the diagram a) is designed in a way making an analysis of
the twin paradox and the above “solution” impossible, as explained next.
Historically, the diagram was suggested to illustrate the SRT causality prin-
ciple. One may consider “ordering” events in terms of past, present, future,
and unreachable (“nothingness”) region outside “light cone” (Synge [9] and
elsewhere). The Euclidean picture can be obtained by “opening out” the
light cone starting from α = π/4 until it becomes ﬂat at α = π/2. In this
conversion of 4-space into 3D space with the absolute time as a parameter,
the above ordering of the events is preserved in Newtonian Physics. The dia-

gram has a sense in illustration of the causality problem but it cannot show,
in principle, how the Minkowski metric works and the Lorentz γ-factor orig-
inates.

Next diagrams b) and c) are suited for discussions of the paradox. A
vertical x-axis indicates a proper distance (in light-second units) traveled by a
particle and represents a spatial dimension in Minkowski space. A horizontal
τ -axis stands for a proper time (previously, a denotation t0 was used). A
family of projected lines t(τ ) = γτ are shown having a slope tan α = γβ.
The time-like metric is seen from the picture: ∆τ 2 = ∆t2
∆x2, that is
τ = t/γ, where sin α = β, cos α = 1/γ. By this way, we present Minkowski
geometrical objects. The diagrams have a reﬂection symmetry for negative
values of x in accordance with philosophy of symmetry of direct and inverse
Lorentz transformations.

−

The diagram b) shows a world-line family obeying a constraint τ = const
with β as a parameter. In other words, the picture manifests the Lorentz
invariance: a tail of each vector originates at a common 0-point and a tip hits
a point on a vertical line τ = τ0 = n0∆τ0 with the clock record n0 = τ0/∆τ0.

There are geometrical relations τ0/t = cos α, x/t = sin α, τ 2
the working formula x = γβτ0 with SRT quantities t = γτ0, x = βt. The
diagram illustrates the clock record concept for the following clock paradox
formulation: given a ﬁxed proper time, ﬁnd a family of lines characterized
by the invariant clock record n0 for diﬀerent β and, correspondingly, cumu-
lative time t. A method of exclusion of end point intervals is advised. It is
understood that a round trip is equivalent to combined two one-way trips in
opposite directions.

Let us consider a particle having a rest life-time τ0 in an example of

1, while n0 is conserved. For example, ultra-relativistic muons,
existence of which in primary cosmic rays cannot be excluded, will travel
huge distances in spite of their short life-time. For energy of about 1021
eV (γ = 1013), a muon would travel a distance about one light-year before
decay. One can arrange an elastic collision to reﬂect a relativistic particle
from a midpoint of a traveled distance back to its source, as in twin paradox.

records of travel time n0, no matter how diﬀerent are t and τ , as was argued
earlier.

0 = t2

The diagram c) is suited for another formulation of the twin paradox
relevant to discussions of the clock record concept in the paragraph “ One-to-
many clock comparison”: given a ﬁxed (proper) distance x0 of space travel,
show a family of world lines with the time travel as a function of β. Due
to the constraint, the 4-vector family does not preserve the proper time τ
or the clock record ticks n. Of course, a symmetry of direct-inverse Lorentz
transformations (an equivalence of Mary’s and John’s points of view) remains
τ 2
intact. There are geometrical relations τ /t = cos α, x0 = t sin α, x2
and a working formula n = x0/βγ∆τ0 = x0/βt. It is seen that a particle
speed cannot exceed the speed of light. From an obsever’s point of view,
a cumulative (improper) time of John’s ﬂight in Mary’s coordinate system
t = x0/β cannot be less than a time of light ﬂight x0. The proper (John’s)
time of travel τ = t/γ = t cos α and the corresponding number of ticks n can
be however small, when β
1. In this limit, a particle vector −→OP becomes
however close to the null vector −−→Ox0. The latter cannot be extended into
a darkened region x > x0 because it would mean a motion with the speed
greater than the speed of light. The diagram does not give a consistent
presentation of vectors with τ < 0; for this reason, the region x > x0 should
be out of consideration. The following numerical examples for ∆τ0= 1 s,

The fact, which cannot be realized by Euclidean mind, is that a particle
with a however small life-time can travel a however great distance. The non-
Euclidean explanation comes from the de Broglie wave phenomenon, which
should be considered in SRT as an additional postulate of phase invariance
of the de Broglie wave. Consider the 4-wave vector in the x-direction. It is

During an elapsed time t = x0/β of travel over a ﬁxed distance x0, the

question arises: which is the standard rod to measure the distance x0 with?
Because light and particle waves propagate out of phase, a proper length unit
must be independent of atomic clock frequency. Nature gives us a natural
all-wave length unit, a distance AB = ∆x0 traveled by light per a time unit
∆t∗ = τB −
τA, as measured by the time of ﬂight method. Thus, in metric
determination and metrology standartization we have a standard time unit
∆τ0 (from the atomic clock relationship m0c2
0 = h/∆τ0) and a standard
length ∆x0 (from the speed of light constancy c0 = ∆x0/∆t∗). The latter
is deﬁned in a description of time of ﬂight measurements with photons of
arbitrary energy frequency. In SI, the second is a duration of 9 192 631 770
periods of a radiation (standard photon) transition between two hyperﬁne
levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom; the meter is the length of
the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458
of a second. Among all photons, let us chose a standard photon, for which a
relationship ∆t∗ = ∆t = γ∆τ0 takes place. Then we connect both units by a
means of introduction of the improper time interval concept ∆t. To measure
the t, more than one clock are needed. Eventually, we have the correlated
time and length units related to universal constants c0, m0, h. An operational
meaning of both units were illustrated by diagrams b) and c). One can
derive the relationship of the de Broglie wave length λdB = h/c0m0γβ and
the standard length x0. In a particular case x0 = λ0 = c0∆τ0 = h/m0c0, we
have λdB/λ0 = n. This is a number of ticks in diagram c).

5 From Kinematics to Dynamics

A close relationship between mass and time in SRT Kinematics is expected in
SRT Dynamics in connection with Minkowski force acting on the proper mass
and by this way inﬂuencing the clock rate consistently with observations. The
Minkowski force can be generally deﬁned

K µ = dP µ/ds = U µ(dm/ds) + m(dU µ/ds)

In the conventional Relativistic Mechanics, the generalized Newton’s law has
a form

dP µ/ds = mdU µ/ds = K µ

with the constant (invariant) proper mass, that is dm/ds = 0. A proper mass
variability in a force ﬁeld was discussed in literature (for example, Moller[3],

(19)

(20)

24

Synge[9], with references), but its consequences were not thoroughly realized
yet. The speculative (alternative) approach to SRT Dynamics and issues of
its empirical veriﬁcation were studied by Author[11],[12]. Next, we are going
to show that a ﬁeld-dependent proper mass can be introduced in the rela-
tivistic Lagrangean framework in a general form. In order to derive covariant
equations of motion, we apply the Hamilton’s extremal action principle with
a proper Lagrangian (in the case of a static potential ﬁeld)

L(s) =

where s = s(xµ) is a world line (arc)length, and a ﬁeld is characterized by
potential energy W measured by a test point particle so that W (xµ)
0
at xµ
(an equivalent mass-energy unit is used for convenience). Thus,
3-velocity β does not appear in the Lagrangian. The variable proper mass in
the Lagrangian describes a kinetic energy formation: its change relates to a
potential energy change under a force ﬁeld action. We want to show a con-
sistence of the Lagrangean method with (19) and (21). The question arises:
how does one know whether the proper mass is constant (as assumed in cur-
rent ﬁeld theories) or ﬁeld dependent (as suggested here)? Our viewpoint is
that the proper mass constancy is the assumption which is neither justiﬁed
by direct experiments nor follows from ﬁrst physical principles: this is the
issue of theory physical foundations and subject to experimental falsiﬁcation
for every fundamental force.

The equations of motion in a covariant form are obtained by applying the
Hamilton’s Principle. The world line length is varied between two ﬁxed end
points a and b:

δS = δ

L(s)ds = Z

δL(s)ds = Z

δs (∂L(s)/∂s) ds = 0

(22)

It should be noted that improper time t does not appear at this stage because
the problem is formulated in a rest frame. We look for equations of motion
giving the solution xµ(s) and m(s); consequently, (22) is taken in the form

δS =

(23)

The action variation (23) is identically equal to zero if L(s) = Const; this is
the expression of conservative properties of ﬁeld, which will follow from the
equations of motion, if the temporal component of Minkowski force is put to

25

zero. To get the equations of motion in an explicit form, one has to conduct
the integration by parts bearing in mind that δs = 0 at the endpoints s = a
and s = b, and diﬀerential and variational operators d and δ are commutative:

δS = L(s)δs

L(s)d(δs) =

L(s)d(δs) = 0

Before proceeding further, let us consider a particular case of a free particle

To set up the expression for δS, one has to start with ds = (dXµdX µ)1/2, sub-
stituting into (25) d(δs) = δds = (∂ds/∂X µ)δ(dX µ) = (dXµ/ds)δ(dX µ) =
Uµd(δX µ) with Uµ(s) = dXµ/ds and integrating m0

Again, we used a condition δX µ = 0 at ﬁxed end points. From (26), it follows
for a free particle that (∂Uµ/∂s) = 0 that is, trajectories of free particles in
the Minkowski space are straight lines, and the 4-momentum is conserved.

Back to the general case: substituting the expression d(δs) = Uµd(δX µ)

into (24) and integrating by parts gives

δS = L(s)UµδX µ

δX µd [L(s)uµ(s)] =

δX µd [L(s)Uµ(s)] = 0

Because variations δX µ are independent for diﬀerent µ, the equality δS = 0
in (28) is possible if and only if

Finally, with the Lagrangian (21) substituted into (29), we have the equations
of motion

∂ [L(s)Uµ(s)]

(31)

characterizing the time-like character of massive particles, they allow us to
determine ﬁve quantities xµ(s), m(s). The equations (30) contain Minkowski
force components, one acting along the world line (the tangent, or parallel
component) and the other (orthogonal) acting perpendicularly to the world
line:

U(dm/ds) = Kk , m(dU/ds) = K⊥,

(Kk ·

d(mU)ds = dP/ds = Kk + K⊥ = K

or

(34)

Next stage would be a change of variables and rewriting the equations in
terms of X i, t and “ordinary” forces F i. Under conditions of proper mass
constancy, the orthogonal component of the Minkowski force vanishes, and
(32) reduces to equations of conventional Relativistic Dynamics. The diﬀer-
ence due to dm/ds term in (34) may be appreciable in a strong ﬁeld domain,
which is hard to investigate experimentally.

In our view, the mass-time complementarity concept provides new op-
portunities of ﬁeld quantization in the whole energy range. Starting with
particle-particle interaction in terms of potential ﬁelds, a problem formula-
tions with a ﬁeld dependent proper mass in terms of wave equations (for ex-
ample, Klein-Gordon equation) would be an alternative approach to quantum
ﬁeld theories. At present, they encounter diﬀerent problems, ﬁrst of all, high-
energy divergence and non-renormalizibility (gravitational problem). By ex-
ploring the role of proper mass variablity, one may gain a new insight into
those problems.

6 Conclusion

To the conclusion, we would like again to emphasize the aspect of SRT physi-
cal foundations which was dominant in the paper: unity of mass and time. A
relativistic approach to Mechanics requires to work with structureless, that
is point particles, nevertheless, having an inner property, a mass. The origin
and relativistic nature of “mass” is a matter of future theories but its funda-
mental signiﬁcance is already seen in SRT quantum connections. We call the
time interval and the mass (two scalars, which are temporary components of
4-position and 4-momentum vectors) complementary because the time rate
is directly related to atomic clock proper mass. Thus, particle-wave duality
is present in SRT in the form of the de Broglie wave concept based on three
universal physical constants c0, m0, h. We explored diﬀerent consequences
of complementarity of Minkowski space using a methodology of imaginary
observations of moving particles exchanging standard photons. In particular,
a scrupulous analysis of the twin paradox was conducted with the conclu-
sion that twins would agree on an equality of travel time record (a number
of atomic clock “ticks”) while the so-called “elapsed time” could be diﬀer-
ent for each twin (depending on comparison conditions). The conclusion is
consistent with Lorentz invariance of the proper time interval.

It is clear that SRT is a model of non-interacting particles that is, forces
are turned oﬀ. Introduction of ﬁeld of forces in Minkowski space is subject to
SRT Dynamics development as a step to a ﬁeld theory. A point particle model
leads to classical self-energy divergence and related to it ﬁeld singularity
problems. These issues are deﬁnitely out of the scope of the present work.
However, it was important, in our view, to show possible consequences of
the mass-time complementarity concept in Relativistic Dynamics in general
form. We know from observations that an external ﬁeld may inﬂuence an
atomic clock rate, and the question arises if the eﬀect can be explained by
action of Minkowski force on the proper mass. The conclusion was made
that such mechanism could exist and should be investigated.

The main objective of the paper is to show the unity of mass and time and
its consequences in Relativistic Theory. Yet, we wanted to explain to general
physicists, philosophers and just interested, familiar with Physics, persons a
physical meaning of time in rigor, Minkowski terms. The paper could also be
helpful in maintaining reservations for those who would attempt to refute,
reinterpret or “improve” SRT Kinematics after Einstein.

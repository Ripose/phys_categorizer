A calculation is presented which quantitatively accounts for the terminal velocity of a cylindrical magnet
falling through a long copper or aluminum pipe. The experiment and the theory are a dramatic illustration of the
Faraday’s and Lenz’s laws and are bound to capture student’s attention in any electricity and magnetism course.

INTRODUCTION

Take a long metal pipe made of a non-ferromagnetic material such as copper or aluminum, hold it vertically with respect to
the ground and place a small magnet at its top aperture. The question is: when the magnet is released will it fall faster, slower,
or at the same rate as a non magnetic object of the same mass and shape? The answer is a dramatic demonstration of the Lenz’s
law, which never ceases to amaze students and professors alike. The magnet takes much more time to reach the ground than a
non-magnetic object. In fact we ﬁnd that for a copper pipe of length L = 1.7m, the magnet takes more than 20s to fall to the
ground, while a non-magnetic object covers the same distance in less than a second! Furthermore, when various magnets are
stuck together and then dropped through the pipe, the time of passage varies non-monotonically with the number of magnets in
the chain. This is contrary to the prediction of the point dipole approximation which is commonly used to explain the slowness
of the falling magnets1,2. The easy availability of powerful rare earth magnets, which can now be purchased in any toy store,
make this demonstration a “must” in any electricity and magnetism course1,2,3,4.

In this paper we will go beyond a qualitative discussion of the dynamics of the falling magnetic and present a theory which
quantitatively accounts for all the experimental ﬁndings. The theory is sufﬁciently simple that it should be easily accessible to
students with only an intermediate exposure to the Maxwell’s equations in their integral form.

Consider a long vertical copper pipe of internal radius a and wall thickness w. A cylindrical magnet of cross-sectional radius
r, height d, and mass m is held over its top aperture, see ﬁgure 1. It is convenient to imagine that the pipe is uniformly subdivided

into parallel rings of width l. When the magnet is released, the magnetic ﬂux in each one of the rings begins to change. This, in
accordance with the Faraday’s law, induces an electromotive force and an electric current inside the ring. The magnitude of the
current will depend on the distance of each ring from the falling magnet as well as on the magnet’s speed. On the other hand,
the law of Biot-Savart states that an electric current produces its own magnetic ﬁeld which, according to the Lenz’s law, must
oppose the action that induced it in the ﬁrst place i.e. the motion of the magnet. Thus, if the magnet is moving away from a given
ring the induced ﬁeld will try to attract it back, while if it is moving towards a ring the induced ﬁeld will tend to repel it. The net
force on the magnet can be calculated by summing the magnetic interaction with all the rings. The electromagnetic force is an
increasing function of the velocity and will decelerate the falling magnet. When the fall velocity reaches the value at which the
magnetic force completely compensates gravity, acceleration will go to zero and the magnet will continue falling at a constant
terminal velocity v. For a sufﬁciently strong magnet, the terminal velocity is reached very quickly.

It is interesting to consider the motion of the magnet from the point of view of energy conservation. When an object free
falls in a gravitational ﬁeld, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. In the case of a falling magnet inside a copper
pipe, the situation is quite different. Since the magnet moves at a constant velocity, its kinetic energy does not change and the
gravitational potential energy must be transformed into something else. This “something else” is the ohmic heating of the copper
pipe. The gravitational energy must, therefore, be dissipated by the eddy currents induced inside the pipe. In the steady state the
rate at which the magnet looses its gravitational energy is equal to the rate of the energy dissipation by the ohmic resistance,

In the above equation z is the coordinate along the pipe length, I(z) is the current induced in the ring located at some position z,
and R is the resistance of the ring. Since the time scales associated with the speed of the falling magnet are much larger than the
ones associated with the decay of eddy currents1,5, almost all the variation in electric current through a given ring results from
the changing ﬂux due to magnet’s motion. The self-induction effects can thus be safely ignored. Our goal, now, is to calculate
the distribution of currents in each ring, I(z). To achieve this we ﬁrst study the rate of change of the magnetic ﬂux through one
ring as the magnet moves through the pipe. Before proceeding, however, we must ﬁrst address the question of the functional
form of the magnetic ﬁeld produced by a stationary magnet. Since the magnetic permeability of copper and aluminum is very
close to that of vacuum, the magnetic ﬁeld inside the pipe is practically identical to the one produced by the same magnet in
vacuum. Normally this ﬁeld is approximated by that of a point dipole. This approximation is sufﬁcient as long as one wants
to study the far ﬁeld properties of the magnetic ﬁeld. For a magnet conﬁned to a pipe whose radius is comparable to its size,
this approximation is no longer valid. Since a large portion of the energy dissipation occurs in the near ﬁeld, one would have to
resum all of the magnetic moments to correctly account for the ﬁeld in the magnet’s vicinity. Clearly this is more work than can
be done in a classroom demonstration. We shall, therefore, take a different road. Let us suppose that the magnet has a uniform
magnetization M = Mˆz. In this case the magnetic charge density inside the magnet is zero, while on the top and the bottom of
the magnet there is a uniform magnetic surface charge density σM = M and
M respectively. The ﬂux produced by
a cylindrical magnet can, therefore, be approximated by a ﬁeld of two disks, each of radius r separated by a distance d. Even
this, however, is not an easy calculation, since the magnetic ﬁeld of a charged disk is a complicated quadrature involving Bessel
functions. We shall, therefore, make a further approximation and replace the charged disks by point monopoles of the same net
charge qm = πr2σM . The ﬂux through a ring produced by the two monopoles can now be easily calculated

where µ0 is the permeability of vacuum and z is the distance from the nearest monopole, which we take to be the positively

where p = qmd is the dipole moment of the falling magnet. We see, however, that as soon as the length of the magnet becomes
comparable to the radius of the pipe, the point dipole approximation fails. In fact, for a realistic cylindrical magnets used in most
demonstrations, one is always outside the the point dipole approximation limit, and the full expression (8) must be used.

III. DEMONSTRATION AND DISCUSSION

In our demonstrations we use a copper pipe (conductivity ρ = 1.75

10−8Ωm)6 of length L = 1.7m, radius a = 7.85mm,
and wall thickness w = 1.9mm; three neodymium cylindrical magnets of mass 6g each, radius r = 6.35mm, and height

d = 6.35mm; a stop watch; and a teslameter. We start by dropping one magnet into the pipe and measure its time of passage
— T = 22.9s. For two magnets stuck together the time of passage increases to T = 26.7s. Note that if the point dipole
approximation would be valid, the time of passage would increase by a factor of two, which is clearly not the case (within point
dipole approximation the time of passage is directly proportional to p2 and inversely proportional to the mass, Eq. (10), sticking
two magnets together increases both the dipole moment and the mass of the magnet by a factor of two). Furthermore, when all
three magnets are stuck together the time of passage drops to T = 23.7s. Since the terminal velocity is reached very quickly,
a constant speed of fall approximation is justiﬁed for the whole length of the pipe. In Table 1 we present the values for the
measured velocity v = L/T . We next compare this measurements with the predictions of the theory. First, however, we have to
obtain the value of qm for the magnet. To do this we measure the magnetic ﬁeld at the center of one of the ﬂat surfaces of the
magnet using the digital teslameter Phywe (the probe of teslameter is brought in direct contact with the surface of the magnet).
Within our uniform magnetization approximation this ﬁeld is produced by two parallel disks of radius r and magnetic surface
charge

Considering the complexity of the problem, the simple theory presented above accounts quite well for all the experimental
ﬁndings. In particular, the theory correctly predicts that two magnets stuck together fall slower than either one magnet separately
or all three magnets together. For each pipe there is, therefore, an optimum magnetic size which falls the slowest.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a simple theory which accounts for the electromagnetic braking of a magnet falling through a conducting
pipe. The experiment is a dramatic illustration of the Faraday’s and Lenz’s law. Perhaps surprisingly, a quantitative discussion
of the experiment is possible with only a basic knowledge of electrodynamics. Furthermore, the only specialized equipment
necessary for performing the measurements is a teslameter, which is usually present in any physics laboratory. The demonstration
and the calculations presented in this paper should, therefore, be easily adoptable to almost any electricity and magnetism course.

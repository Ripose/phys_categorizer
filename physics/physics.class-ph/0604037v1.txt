On the Solution of Maxwell’s First
Order Equations

Abstract
In an attempt to solve Maxwell’s ﬁrst order system of equations, starting from a given
initial state, it is found that a consistent solution depending on the temporal evolution
of the sources cannot be calculated. The well known retarded solutions of the second
order equations, which are based on the introduction of potentials, turn out to be in
disagreement with a direct solution of the ﬁrst order system.

PACS number: 03.50.De

1. Introduction
In recent papers [1, 2] it was shown that Maxwell’s equations have diﬀerent formal
solutions depending on the chosen gauge. In [2] it was argued that the formalism of
gauge invariance is based on the tacit assumption of Maxwell’s equations having unique
solutions which appeared, however, not to be guaranteed a priori. In response to the
publication of [2] it was pointed out in private communications [3] that uniqueness is
a necessary consequence of the linear structure of the equations. These arguments are
valid. If one ﬁnds, nevertheless, diﬀerent solutions in Lorenz and in Coulomb gauge, it
seems to indicate that a solution does not exist at all. Indeed, it was shown in [2] that
the Li´enard-Wiechert ﬁelds based on the Lorenz gauge do not satisfy the equations in
the source region, unless one postulates a velocity dependent “deformation” of point
charges as in [1]. Furthermore, the formal solution for the vector potential in Coulomb
gauge led to an undeﬁned conditionally convergent integral which would even diverge
upon diﬀerentiation.

The reason for the diﬃculties encountered could have to do with the assumption of
point sources which were exclusively considered in [2]. Therefore, it appears worthwhile
to investigate the problem further, assuming smooth charge and current distributions
as originally considered by Maxwell. In order to avoid any ambiguities arising from
the introduction of potentials, it seems advisable to analyse directly the solvability
of the ﬁrst order system of Maxwell’s equations (Sect. 2.).
It turns out that the
coupled ﬁrst order system contains certain inconsistencies which prevent its solution
when calculated by a numerical forward method proceeding in time.

The usual method of solution derives inhomogeneous wave equations from the
ﬁrst order system, and expresses the solutions as retarded integrals by application of
Duhamel’s principle. In [2] it was argued that this method is not plausible, since the
wave equations obtained by diﬀerentiating the ﬁrst order system connect the travelling
ﬁelds with the stationary sources at the same time, while in the retarded solutions the
diﬀerentiation of the sources is inconsistently dated back to an earlier time. In Sect. 3.

we analyze the retarded solutions for smooth source distributions and ﬁnd that these
solutions do not satisfy the ﬁrst order system. This is demonstrated in Sect. 4. by
considering a speciﬁc example.

2. The ﬁrst order equations
In vacuo the ﬁrst order system as devised by Hertz on the basis of Maxwell’s equations
is supposed to describe the electromagnetic ﬁeld:
div ~Eg = 4π ρ

(1)

∂ ~B
∂t

rot ~Er = −

1
c
div ~B = 0

rot ~B =

~j +

4π
c

~Eg + ~Er

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

rot ~B0 =

∂ ~Eg
∂t

4π
c

~j +

1
c
∂ ~Er
∂t

1
c

rot ~B1 =

Here we have indicated that the electric ﬁeld has two contributions of diﬀerent struc-
ture.
In (1) only the irrotational part enters, whereas (2) contains exclusively the
rotational part of the ﬁeld. Both parts enter equation (4). One may separate out the
instantaneous contribution of the magnetic ﬁeld and write (4) as two equations:

The quasi-static solutions of (1) and (5) – subject to the boundary condition that the
ﬁelds vanish at inﬁnity – are represented by integrals over all space:

~Eg (~x, t) =

ρ (~x′, t) (~x − ~x′)

ZZZ

d3x′
|~x − ~x′|3

~B0 (~x, t) =

1
c ZZZ

~j (~x′, t) +


1
4π

∂ ~Eg (~x′, t)
∂t

× (~x − ~x′

)

d3x′
|~x − ~x′|3





It remains then to determine the rotational part of the electric ﬁeld and the contribu-
tion ~B1.

Applying a numerical forward method one obtains from (6) the diﬀerence equation:



and from (2):

~Er (∆t) = ~Er (0) + ∆t c rot ~B1 (0)

~B (∆t) = ~B (0) − ∆t c rot ~Er (0)

~Er (0) = ~B1 (0) = 0

Assuming that the sources were constant for t ≤ 0 one has the initial conditions:

Substituting this into (9) and (10) one ﬁnds the curious result that neither ~Er nor the
total magnetic ﬁeld ~B proceed after the ﬁrst time step, and this will remain so forever,

(2)

(3)

(5)

(6)

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

at least in the vacuum region outside the sources. If the current would linearly rise to
a new stationary level, e.g., equation (10) would predict that ~B stays constant at its
initial value, in contrast to (8) which predicts that ~B0 rises simultaneously with the
current and reaches a new stationary value as well.

One may also split (2) into two equations:

rot ~Er0 = −

rot ~Er1 = −

∂ ~B0
∂t
∂ ~B1
∂t

1
c

1
c

(12)

(13)

(14)

(16)

(17)

The quasi-static solution of (12) is:

~Er0 = −

1
4π c ZZZ

∂ ~B0
∂t

×

~x − ~x′
|~x − ~x′|3 d3x′

and from (13) follows:

~B1 (∆t) = ~B1 (0) − ∆t c rot ~Er1 (0) = 0
(15)
If ~B1 vanishes after the ﬁrst time step as follows from (15), and ~B stays also constant
according to (10), a clear contradiction with (8) arises. Furthermore, equation (9)
predicts that the total rotational electric ﬁeld stays constant, whereas the quasi-static
part (14) follows instantaneously all changes of ~B0 (t) according to (14).

We note that the quasi-static expressions (7), (8), (14) can be seen as solutions
of elliptic equations. On the other hand, one obtains from (2) and (4) by mutual
elimination of the ﬁelds the inhomogeneous hyperbolic equations:

∆ ~B −

∂~j

As indicated in [2], the mixture of elliptic and hyperbolic equations inherent to Maxwell’s
system leads apparently to the inconsistencies which manifest themselves in the in-
congruities implied in (10) as compared to (8), and in (14) as compared to (9). The
system (1 – 4) does not permit a continuous temporal evolution from a given realistic
initial state. In a region where the sources in (16) and (17) vanish the homogeneous
hyperbolic equations describe correctly propagating electromagnetic ﬁelds, but their
production mechanism in connection to the sources remains obscure.

Since in all textbooks it is claimed that Maxwell’s equations do have solutions which
are uniquely determined when the behaviour of the sources is given as a function of
space and time, we must discuss the usual procedure to obtain these solutions which
– according to our analysis – cannot satisfy the ﬁrst order system.

3. The retarded solutions
The normal method of solution expresses the ﬁelds by potentials:

~B = rot ~A ,

~E = −∇φ −

∂ ~A
∂t

1
c

(18)

which leads to inhomogeneous wave equations in Lorenz gauge:

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(25)

(26)

(27)

They are solved by application of Duhamel’s principle to yield the retarded solutions,
e.g.:

~A (~x, t) =

~j (~x′ , t − |~x − ~x′ |/c)

1
c ZZZ

d3x′
|~x − ~x′ |

Instead of introducing potentials one may solve the wave equations for the ﬁelds

directly. The magnetic ﬁeld, for example, can be expressed as the sum:

where ~B0 is the instantaneous part (8), and ~B1 satisﬁes according to (16) the equation:

∆φ −

∆ ~A −

1
c2

∂2φ
∂t2 = −4π ρ
∂2 ~A

~B = ~B0 + ~B1

∆ ~B1 −

1
c2

∂2 ~B1
∂t2 =

∂2 ~B0
∂t2

In analogy to (21) this equation has the retarded solution:

~B1 (~x, t) = −

1
4π c2

∂2 ~B0 (~x′, t′)
∂t′2

d3x′
|~x − ~x′ |

,

ZZZ









Similarly, one may write:

~E = ~E0 + ~E1

and obtain from (17) a second order diﬀerential equation for ~E1:

t′ = t − |~x − ~x′ |/c

(24)

where ~E0 is the instantaneous part of the electric ﬁeld resulting from (5) and (12):

∆ ~E1 −

1
c2

∂2 ~E1
∂t2 =

1

∂2 ~E0

~E0 (~x, t) = −

1
c2

ZZZ  

∂~j (~x′, t)
∂t

!

d3x′
|~x − ~x′ |

The retarded solution of (26) is then:

~E1 (~x, t) = −

1
4π c2

∂2 ~E0 (~x′, t′)
∂t′2

d3x′
|~x − ~x′ |

,

ZZZ









t′ = t − |~x − ~x′ |/c

(28)

It turns out that the ﬁelds as obtained from (21) and (18) are not the same ﬁelds
as that calculated from (22), (8), and (24), and from (25), (27), and (28). This will
be demonstrated in the next Section by choosing a speciﬁc example. Hence, we must
conclude that the retarded solutions cannot be considered as true solutions of the ﬁrst
order equations.

The reason for this failure must be sought in the inconsistency which lies in the
fact that equations (20), (23), (26) connect the sources ~j (~x, t), ~B0 (~x, t), ~E0 (~x, t),

respectively, with the travelling wave ﬁelds ~A (~x, t), ~B1 (~x, t), ~E1 (~x, t) at the same time
t, whereas in the retarded solutions (21), (24), (28) the diﬀerentiation of the source is
dated back to the earlier time t′ = t − |~x − ~x′ |/c. As pointed out in [2], the source may
be very far away from the observation point, and may not even exist anymore when the
ﬁelds ~B1 (~x, t), ~E1 (~x, t) are measured at time t. It makes little sense to diﬀerentiate
non-existent instantaneous ﬁelds at time t, but this was necessary to derive equations
(16), (17) from the system (1 – 4). Obviously, it constitutes a contradictio in adjecto
connecting the travelling ﬁelds predicted by (16) and (17) with the stationary sources
in the ﬁrst order system at the same time.

4. A speciﬁc example
In order to facilitate the calculations we choose an example where we have div ~j = 0.
In this case the scalar potential vanishes because of ρ = 0 which makes Lorenz and
Coulomb gauge identical: div ~A = 0. The chosen example is a hollow cylinder which
carries a closed oscillating current driven by an rf-generator through a resistor R, as
sketched in Fig. 1. It is assumed that the current was switched on at time t = −∞
and oscillates with a sinusoidal time dependence: I exp (−i ω t). The current ﬂows in
a thin central ﬁlament, and returns symmetrically on the cylindrical surface. This can
be achieved to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, if the inverse wave vector k = ω/c is
large compared to the dimensions of the device.

equations (23) and (26). In order to check on this we consider, e.g., equation (23)

which is obviously at variance with the right-hand-side of (35). A similar conclusion
is reached, if (33) is substituted into (26). This can only be checked numerically, since
the instantaneous ﬁeld ~E0 does not vanish outside the cylinder, in contrast to ~B0.

Result (38) proves that the standard solutions (32) and (33) do not satisfy the ﬁrst
order system from which equations (16) and (17) were derived. Hence, our conclusion
in Sect. 2., namely that the ﬁrst order system does not permit a solution, cannot be
refuted by referring to the retarded solutions as taught in the textbooks such as [4].

There is also a physical reason to reject Jackson’s solution (31) for the considered
case. If one calculates the ﬁelds with (18) from (31) and evaluates the Poynting vector
~E × ~B at large distance, one can integrate the total radiation power emitted by the
closed circuit of Fig. 1:

This result is obviously not physical. The device in question may be seen as a short-
circuited cable which should not continuously loose energy to the outside world; in
particular not when the enclosing shell would be made out of superconducting material.
The predicted power loss (39) could certainly not be conﬁrmed experimentally.

5. Conclusions
It has been shown that an attempt to calculate numerically the temporal evolution
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld from the full set of Maxwell’s ﬁrst order equations will
fail due to the internal inconsistencies built into the coupled system of equations. As
noted earlier [2], the reason lies in the fact that the travelling wave ﬁelds are connected
with the stationary sources at the same time.

Maxwell’s equations describe correctly the production of the instantaneous electro-
magnetic ﬁeld, and also the propagation of wave ﬁelds in empty space. The production
mechanism of electromagnetic waves by time varying sources, however, does not ﬁnd
an explanation in the framework of Maxwell’s theory. Contrary to what is commonly
believed, the retarded solutions for the electromagnetic potentials do not lead to ﬁelds
which are in agreement with a direct solution of the second order diﬀerential equations
for the ﬁelds.

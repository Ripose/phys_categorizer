A simple method of calculating the Wannier-Stark resonances in 2D lattices is suggested. Using
this method we calculate the complex Wannier-Stark spectrum for a non-separable 2D potential
realized in optical lattices and analyze its general structure. The dependence of the lifetime of
Wannier-Stark states on the direction of the static ﬁeld (relative to the crystallographic axis of the
lattice) is brieﬂy discussed.

I.

INTRODUCTION

The quantum states of a particle in a periodic po-
tential plus homogeneous ﬁeld (known nowadays as the
Wannier-Stark states, WS-states in what follows) are one
of the long-standing problems of single-particle quantum
mechanics. The beginning of the study of this problem
dates back to the paper by Bloch of 1929, followed by
contributions of Zener, Landau, Wannier, Zak and many
others [1].
In the late eighties the problem got a new
impact by the invention of semiconductor superlattices.
The unambiguous observation of the WS-spectrum in a
semiconductor superlattice [2] ended a long theoretical
debate about the nature of WS-states, and now it is com-
monly accepted that they are the resonance states of the
system. Besides, WS-states were recently studied in a
system of cold atoms in an optical lattice [3] and some
other (quasi) one-dimensional systems.
Although WS-states are resonances,

i.e. metastable
states,
in the theoretical analysis of related problems
they were usually approximated by stationary states
(one-band, tight-binding, and similar approximations).
Beyond the one-band approximation, WS-states in the
semiconductor and optical lattices were studied in recent
papers [4] and [5] by using the scattering matrix approach
of Ref. [6] (see also Ref. [7] for details). This approach ac-
tually solves the one-dimensional Wannier-Stark problem
and supplies exhaustive information about 1D WS-states.
In the present letter we extend the method of Ref. [6, 7]
to the case of two-dimensional lattices. For the ﬁrst time
we ﬁnd the complex spectrum of 2D WS-states and ana-
lyze its general structure.

To be concrete, we choose the following system:

H = p2/2 + V (r) + F · r ,

r = (x, y) ,

(1)

V (r) = cos x + cos y − ǫ cos x cos y ,

(2)

where 0 ≤ ǫ ≤ 1 [8]. Two limiting cases ǫ = 0 and
ǫ = 1 correspond to an ‘egg crate’ potential, for which
the system is separable, and a ‘quantum well’ potential,
where the coupling between two degrees of freedom is
maximal (see Fig. 1). Let us also note that the choice
ǫ = 1 corresponds to a 2D optical potential created by
two standing laser waves crossing at right angle. Thus
the results presented below can be directly applied to the
system of cold atoms in a 2D optical lattice.

2D WANNIER-BLOCH SPECTRUM

We brieﬂy recall the key points of the 1D theory. The
spectrum of the Bloch particle in the presence of a static
ﬁeld consists of several sets of equidistant levels

Eα,l = Eα + 2πF l − iΓα/2 ,

(3)

known as Wannier-Stark ladders of resonances.
In
Eq. (3), 2π stands for the lattice period, F is the am-
plitude of the static force, l = 0,±1, . . . is the site index
and the index α = 0, 1, . . . labels diﬀerent ladders. The
lifetime of WS-states Ψα,l(x) is deﬁned by the resonance
width Γα as τα = ¯h/Γα. Typically, the lifetime τα rapidly
decreases with increasing index α. Because of this only
the ﬁrst few WS-ladders are of physical importance.

Along with the WS-states Ψα,l(x), one can also intro-

duce Wannier-Bloch states (WB-states) by

ψα,k(x) =Xl

Ψα,l(x) exp(i2πkl) .

(4)

As follows from the deﬁnition (4), the continuous evo-
lution of WB-states obeys the equation ψα,k(x, t) =
exp(−iEαt/¯h)ψα,k−F t/¯h(x), where Eα = Eα − iΓα/2.
Thus, WB-states can be alternatively deﬁned as the
eigenfunction of the evolution operator over the Bloch pe-
riod TB = ¯h/F . (Note that the eigenvalues of the evolu-
tion operator form degenerate bands Eα(k) = Eα). Addi-
tionally, to ensure that ψα,k(x) are resonance states of the
system, the eigenvalue equation for the evolution opera-
tor should be accomplished by the speciﬁc non-hermitian
boundary condition. It was proven in Ref. [7] that the
required boundary conditions are imposed by the trunca-
tion of the evolution operator matrix in the momentum
representation.

We proceed with the two-dimensional case. As men-
tioned above, WB-states in a 1D lattice can be deﬁned

as the non-hermitian eigenstates of the evolution opera-
tor over one Bloch period. In the 2D problem there are
two diﬀerent Bloch periods associated with the two com-
ponents of the static ﬁeld. Therefore the notion of the
WB-states can be introduced only in the case of com-
mensurate periods, i.e., in the case of ‘rational’ direction
of the ﬁeld (q, r are coprime integers):

Fx =

Provided condition (5) is satisﬁed, we deﬁne 2D WB-
states as the non-hermitian eigenfunctions of the sys-
tem evolution operator over the common Bloch period
TB = (r2 + q2)1/2¯h/F . Using the Kramers-Henneberger
transformation, the evolution operator can be presented

Transformation (8) introduces a new lattice period a =

ated with the new lattice period is a new Bloch time
Ta = (r2 + q2)−1/2 ¯h/F , which is s times shorter than
the original Bloch time TB. Using ˆp′

which is presumed in the numerical calculations, auto-
matically imposes the non-hermitian boundary condition
along the x′-direction. (Truncation of the matrix over the
index n′
y does not change the hermitian boundary
condition along the y′-direction.) Then the eigenvalues
E obtained by numerical diagonalization of the truncated
matrix correspond to the quantum resonances.
In the transformed coordinates, the unit cell with area
a2 = (2π)2s contains s diﬀerent sublattices (see Fig. 2),
and each of them supports its own WB-states. The
sublattices are related by primitive translations of the
unrotated lattice, and correspondingly the energies of

x, k′

their WB-states diﬀer by multiples of aF/s. Further-
more, as function of the quasimomentum, the energies
E = E (i)
y) (here β = 0, 1, . . . is the ‘Bloch band’
index and i = 1, . . . , s is the sublattice index) do not de-
pend on k′
x. This follows from the fact that a change of
k′
x in Eq. (13) can be compensated by shifting the time
origin in Eq. (9). For the y′-degree of freedom the Bloch
theorem can be applied, and therefore E (i)
y) is a
periodic function of k′
y with generally nonzero amplitude
∆Eβ. Thus, assuming a rational direction of the ﬁeld,
in each fundamental energy interval aF , the static ﬁeld
induces s = r2 + q2 identical sub-bands, separated by
the energy interval aF/s. Simultaneously, the size of the
Brillouin zone is reduced by a factor s. This result re-
sembles the one obtained for 1D Wannier-Stark system
aﬀected by a time-periodic perturbation.
In the latter
case – provided the condition of comensurability between
the Bloch period and the period of the driving force is
fulﬁlled – the quasienergy spectrum of the system has a
similar structure [9].

We conclude this section with a remark concerning the
numerical procedure. Although the reduced Brillouin
zone approach described above is the most consistent,
we found it more convenient to diagonalize the evolu-
tion operator without preliminary rotation of the coordi-
nate. In other words, in order to ﬁnd the WB-spectrum,
we solve the eigenvalue equation (12) with the truncated
matrix constructed on the basis of the operator (6). As
a result of the diagonalization, one obtains eigenvalues
Eβ(kx, ky) with quasimomentum k = (kx, ky) deﬁned
in the original Brillouin zone. Because the WB-bands
are uniform along the direction of the ﬁeld, Eβ(kx, ky)
is a periodic function of both kx and ky with periods
1/r and 1/q respectively. The energies obtained in this
way can then be used to construct the complete WB-
spectrum E (i)
y), i = 1, . . . , s. In the next section
we present results of a numerical calculation of the dis-
persion relation Eβ(kx, ky) for the periodic potential (2)
and moderate values of the static ﬁeld F = (Fx, Fy),
|F| = F = const.

III. NUMERICAL RESULTS

It is instructive to begin with the separable case ǫ = 0.
In this case, 2D WB-states are given by the product of
1D states and 2D WB-energies are just the sum of 1D
energies. In what follows we restrict ourselves to analyz-
ing only the ground band. First we consider the real part
of the spectrum E0 = Re(E0).
It was shown in the previous section that for rational
directions of the ﬁeld the ground WB-subbands repeat
with energy splitting aF/s. As an example, Fig. 4 shows
the relative positions of these subbands as a function of
the angle θ = arctan(r/q) for ¯h = 2 and F = 0.08√2. We
recall that in the considered case of a separable potential
the bands have zero width for any θ 6= 0, π/2.

FIG. 4: Real (left) and imaginary (right) parts of the dis-
persion relation Eβ(kx, ky) for the ground WB-states and dif-
ferent values of the potential parameter ǫ = 0, 0.1,0.5, and
1 (from top to bottom). The system parameters are ¯h = 2,
Fx = Fy = 0.08, and ky = 0.

The main diﬀerence between separable and non-
separable potentials is that the subbands E(i)
0 (k) have
a ﬁnite width in the latter case. This is illustrated by
Fig. 4(a) which shows the dispersion relation E0(kx, ky =
0) for the potential (2) with (from top to bottom) ǫ = 0,
0.1, 0.5, and 1. The direction of the ﬁeld is θ = π/4,
i.e. r = q = 1. The amplitude of the static ﬁeld and
the value of the scaled Planck constant are the same as
in Fig. 4.
It is seen in Fig. 4(a) that the WB-bands
gain a ﬁnite width as ǫ is increased. We also calculated
the dispersion relation E0(kx, ky = 0) for diﬀerent an-
gles θ = arctan(r/q), with r, q ≤ 6. It was found that the
band widths ∆E0 = ∆E0(r, q) are typically much smaller
than the mean energy separation between the subbands.
Thus, for practical purpose, one can neglect the band
width for the real part of the spectrum. (An exception is
the case θ = 0, π/2 where the width of the WB-bands ap-
proximately coincides with the width of the Bloch band
in the absence of the static ﬁeld.) Neglecting the width
of the bands they were found to form a structure similar
to that shown in Fig. 4.

We proceed with the analysis of the decay rate of the
WB-states, which is determined by the imaginary part
of the complex energy, Γ0 = −2Im(E0). In the case of
a separable potential the dependence Γ0 = Γ0(F, θ) is
obviously given by the equation

Γ0(F, θ) = Γ′

0(F cos θ) + Γ′

0(F sin θ) ,

(15)

where Γ′
0(F ′) stands for the width of 1D WS-resonances.
For the parameters used (¯h = 2 and F = 0.08√2) the
dependence (15) is shown in Fig. 5 by a solid line. The
maximum around θ = π/2 originates from a peak-like
0(F ′) and is explained by the phenomenon
behavior of Γ′
of 1D resonant tunneling [7].

For a non-separable potential and rational direction
of the ﬁeld the decay rate depends on the quasimomen-

tum. For the particular case θ = π/4 this dependence is
depicted in Fig. 4(b). We would like to note the compli-
cated behavior of Γ0(k). The oscillating character of the
decay rate is an open problem for the present day. Be-
cause the decay rate depends on the quasimomentum it
might be convenient to introduce the notion of ¯Γ0, where
the average is taken over the reduced Brillouin zone. The
dots in Fig. 1 show the values of ¯Γ0 for some rational di-
rection of the ﬁeld and two diﬀerent values of ǫ.
It is
seen that for a small ǫ = 0.1 the ratio ∆Γ0/¯Γ0 is small
and the obtained dependence ¯Γ0 = ¯Γ0(r, q) essentially
reproduces that of the separable case. However, this is
not valid for ǫ = 1, where the decay rate varies wildly.
Thus, in the case of strong coupling between two degrees
of freedom the description of WS-state by a mean decay
rate is insuﬃcient.

IV. CONCLUSION

We studied Wannier resonances in a 2D system, mainly
discussing the complex energy spectrum of the Wannier-

4

Bloch states. However, because the latter are related to
the Wannier-Stark states by a Fourier transformation,
the obtained results can be easily reformulated in terms
of the Wannier-Stark resonances. Then the following is
valid. (i) Neglecting the asymptotic tail, WS-states are
localized functions along the direction of the ﬁeld. (This
follows from the degeneracy of WB-bands along the ﬁeld
direction.)
(ii) For any rational direction of the ﬁeld
[see Eq. (5)] WS-states are Bloch waves in the transverse
direction. (iii) For a non-separable potential the corre-
sponding energy bands have a ﬁnite width. (iv) For the
real part of the spectrum, the band widths are small and
can be well neglected for r, q > 1.

We also found a nontrivial dependence of the resonance
width (inverse lifetime of WS-states) on the direction of
the ﬁeld. Because the value of the resonance width de-
ﬁnes the decay of the probability, a complicated behavior
of the survival probability is expected when the direction
of the ﬁeld is varied. The detailed study of the probabil-
ity dynamics is reserved for future publication.

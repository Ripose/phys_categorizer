Synthesis of unilateral radiators

Abstract. - A radiator is typically a parabolic mirror illuminated by an electromagnetic source, or a
cylindrical transducer of resonant vibrations. Both of these devices are designed to radiate either a beam
of parallel rays or a (focused) beam that converges to a point or a line. Consequently, at the worst, the
radiation pattern is largely restricted to a half space, and at the best, to a cone or cylinder-like subspace
of this half space. Such devices can therefore be termed unilateral radiators. This study is devoted to the
synthesis of the sources that can give rise to such radiation, the underlying motivation being the removal of
the material presence of the mirror or transducer casing from which waves coming from other boundaries
could reﬂect or diﬀract.

Introduction

Often one wants to predict the waveﬁeld arising from sources radiating waves that are diﬀracted
from various material objects (termed obstacles) in an otherwise homogeneous space. In real life,
the so-called radiated wave is the result of a complex process involving conversion of an electrical
signal into a (e.g., acoustic) wave which is formed in some manner within a so-called antenna
(which sometimes reduces to a casing or radome). The radiated wave then propagates towards
the obstacles present in the space and is diﬀracted by the latter. Some of the diﬀracted waves are
redirected towards the antenna, and since the latter is also a material object, it can diﬀract these
waves in its turn.

It is diﬃcult to account for this multiple diﬀraction between the antenna and the objects, so
the usual procedure is to assume that the radiator is only a collection of sources without material
presence. In other words, one assumes that the antenna radiates waves, but does not diﬀract waves
returning from the obstacles.

In order for this to be possible, at least in theory, one must reduce the radiator, which is
composed of sources and an antenna (see for instance, ﬁg. 1 for an example of a parabolic cylinder
radiator), to a mere collection of sources. The latter, by deﬁnition, radiate outgoing waves, but do
not diﬀract incoming waves. Moreover, in the present instance, one wants the radiator to radiate
unilaterally, i.e., predominantly within a half space. Usually, this is not a simple task, as a point
source radiates in all space, so that it is natural to think that a collection of point sources will also
radiate in all space.

In the present investigation, we show that a particular combination of so-called single and

3

double sources enables one to synthesize an essentially-unilateral radiator.

2 Diﬀraction of a wave by an impenetrable screen with a ﬁnite-

size aperture

2.1 Preliminaries

This section is devoted to the study of the simplest of radiating devices: an impenetrable screen
with an aperture.

Henceforth, we treat only 2D problems in which the support of the sources are cylinders parallel

to the x3 cartesian coordinate and the objects do not depend on this coordinate either.

The conﬁguration, in the x1 −

x2 plane, is depicted in ﬁg. 2. The inﬁnitely-thin impenetrable
screen is denoted by the vertical dark black lines Γ+ and Γ− which are separated by a slit-like
aperture Γ0. This obstacle is illuminated by a wave radiated by sources contained within the
domain Ωi. The half space to the left of the screen (minus the support of the sources) is designated
by Ω− and the half space to the right of the screen by Ω+. These half spaces can be thought of as
being closed by the semi circles (of inﬁnite radius) Γ−
∞ respectively. The outward-pointing unit
vector normal to Γ−, Γ0, Γ−

∞ is designated by ν, as in ﬁg. 2.

∞, Γ+

∞ Γ+

The horizontal distance of the screen from the origin O is c and the width of the slit is d, with

the x1 axis being at equal vertical distance from the two extremities of the slit.

Henceforth, we shall be concerned with a scalar wave problem such as one that arises in acoustics
(in ﬂuids). The total scalar (pressure) waveﬁeld will be represented by the function u(x, ω) in the
space-frequency domain, with x = (x1, x2) the position vector in the cross-section plane and ω
iωt), with t the time variable. The
the angular frequency. The implicit temporal factor is exp(
waveﬁeld does not depend on x3 due to the fact that the sources and the screen+slit do not depend
on this variable.

2.2 The ﬁeld in the absence of the screen

In the absence of the screen, the total ﬁeld is only the one radiated by the applied sources so that
the problem reduces to determining u(x, ω) which satisﬁes

Eq. (15) is a bona ﬁde boundary integral representation of the ﬁeld in the right hand half space. If
the integral in (16) were equal to u(x, ω) in the left hand half space, then (16) would seem to imply
Ω− which would mean that, by some miracle, we had devised a unilateral
that u(x, ω) = 0 ; x
radiator by simply placing a screen with a slit in front of an arbitrary source distribution. This, of
course, cannot be true, but it is a result that we are aiming for.

(cid:3)

To proceed further in rigorous manner would require solving an integral equation, a procedure
we wish to avoid. Thus, we adopt the approximation method employed since more than a hundred
years by many researchers in the acoustics, electromagnetics, and optics communities (Baker and
Copson, 1950). To begin, this involves the generalization of the notion of screen impenetrability,
which, simply stated, requires that the screen is simultaneously acoustically-hard and acoustically-
soft. The consequence of this (mathematically-impossible) requirement is that

A further aspect of the procedure adopted by the above-mentioned researchers is the introduc-
tion of the so-called Kirchhoﬀ approximation of the ﬁeld in the slit. This ansatz (similar in some

The previous analysis showed that employing the generalized impenetrability conditions and the
Kirchoﬀ approximation enables one to obtain an approximate solution for the ﬁeld in the right
hand half space and what appears like a null ﬁeld in the left hand half space around a slit in an
impenetrable screen. Since this result is approximate, it does not satisfy the governing equations
of the original problem. As concerns the space-frequency wave equation expressed in (6), this fact
is easy to demonstrate by simply taking the spatial derivatives of (20) whereupon one ﬁnds that
the right hand side of the equation in (6) is no longer nil, i.e.,

(23)

Rather than do these operations, we will give the result for S and then go the other way around
by showing that u for this source distribution has the desired properties, notably of producing a
null ﬁeld in Ω−.

recognized to be a distribution of single and double sources on a strip. The latter is none other
than the slit of the previous problem.

To ensure uniqueness of this radiation problem, we must specify that the wave radiated by this

distribution of sources is outgoing far from the support of the sources.
As previously, we can show that the radiated ﬁeld is of the form

where it is understood that the ﬁeld u(x, ω) in (34) and (37) is the ﬁeld radiated by the distribution
of applied sources given in (24). This means that the source function (24) radiates in the sought-
for unilateral manner. Of course, this is only an approximation, but we shall discover further on
that it is a good approximation. Thus, we have shown how to synthesize the sources that give
rise to unilateral radiator. Replacing the physical radiator (e.g., parabolic antenna, cylindrical
transducer) by this source distribution enables the elimination of undesirable multiple diﬀraction
eﬀects between the radiator and obstacles.

4 Radiation from a parabolic cylinder radiator

The cross section view of the parabolic cylinder radiator is given in ﬁg. 1. An inﬁnitely-thin
impenetrable curved sheet (Γ) reﬂector, in the form of a portion of a parabola, is illuminated by a
line source located at the origin O. The equation of the sheet is

x1 = F (x2) :=

wherein f is the focal length and d the width of the reﬂector aperture. The left hand extremity of
the reﬂector is at x1 =

or, for that matter, by an impedance boundary condition, since, in the high frequency situation of
interest herein, the precise nature of the boundary condition is not important.

There exists a variety of exact and approximate methods for predicting the radiation produced
by this device (Tanteri and Wirgin, 1975); we shall choose a so-called aperture method (Silver, 1949)
which is approximate in nature and based on the following two hypotheses:

1. geometrical optics (or acoustics) governs the propagation of the ﬁeld from the source to the

reﬂector and from the latter to the aperture,

2. the Huyghens-Fresnel principle (equivalent to the result of the analysis in sect. 2) governs
the propagation of the ﬁeld from the aperture of the mirror to points within Ω+ (i.e., the half
space to the right of the aperture).

A necessary (although not necessarily-suﬃcient) condition for the validity of the ﬁrst hypothesis is
that kf >> 1 (Tanteri and Wirgin, 1975). If it is recalled that the ﬁeld radiated by the line source
located at x′ = 0 is i

Thus, the ﬁrst hypothesis of this aperture method, is equivalent to the statement that the phase
kc + ψ is a constant, and the amplitude A(x2) is a tapered function of x2, in the aperture
of the
parabolic reﬂector. Note that for a plane body wave normally-incident on the screen+slit system,
.
both the amplitude and phase are constant in

A

Naturally, (46) does not account for diﬀraction eﬀects (assumed to be produced only in the half
space to the right of the aperture) due to the encounter of ui with the edges of the mirror. The
contribution of these eﬀects to points within Ω+ is introduced by means of the second hypothesis

A

whose mathematical expression is given either by the ﬁrst or second Rayleigh-Sommerfeld formulae
(Siver, 1949), or, as herein, by (21). The choice of one or another of these formulae constitutes
the essential diﬀerence between the three types of aperture methods. Experience shows that the
two Rayleigh-Sommerﬂed formulae yield similar results in both the near and far ﬁeld regions of Ω+
when kf > 2.5π. We prefer the third aperture method, embodied in (21), because it has the unique
property of leading to unilateral radiation if abstraction is made of the reﬂector antenna once the
ﬁeld it generates attains the aperture.

The question that arises is what should be taken for ui and/or ui

,1′ in (21). In other words,
˜U,1′, or, on the contrary, ui
should one take ui
,1′? Due to the
fact that, in practice, the source of reﬂector antennas is generally masked so as not to radiate in
directions other than towards the reﬂector, it seems reasonable to choose the second solution.

r′ cos φ′ = c, and r, φ the polar coordinates of the observation point subtended by the vector x
such that r cos φ = x1. Then

We plot this function (dotted curve) in ﬁg. 3 for a source distribution which synthesizes the
radiation of a parabolic cylinder antenna for which kd = 20π and c = 0. The full line curve therein
is the result of a rigorous computation of the ﬁeld radiated by this antenna on which a Dirichlet
boundary condition is imposed, and the other two curves represent the predictions resulting from
the other two aperture methods. We note that our synthesized sources indeed give rise to very
weak radiation in the left hand half space (i.e., for φ > 90o, there being symmetry around φ = 0.
We also not that the other three radiation patterns do not possess this property.

6 Final comments on the use of the synthesized sources of a uni-

lateral radiator in a scattering problem

A typical problem of the scattering of a wave ui radiated from synthesized sources s of support Ωi
by some boundary Γ on which the ﬁeld is nil (i.e., Dirichlet boundary condition) is expressed as
follows: determine the total ﬁeld u = ui + ud in a domain Ω such that:

Actually, it is possible to assume other expressions for ˜U i as long as they are connected in some
plausible way with an actual physically-realizable unilateral radiator.

The previous analysis showed that

ui(x, ω) =

G(x, x′, ω)s(x′, ω)d̟(x′) ; x

So much for the incident ﬁeld on the boundary.

The next step is to ﬁnd an appropriate (boundary integral, domain integral, partial wave, etc.)
representation of the scattered ﬁeld ud that incorporates the radiation condition (67). This involves
some unknown functions that are determined in the ﬁnal step by application of the boundary
condition (68).

It will be noted that the use of our synthesized source distribution s: 1) enables us to simu-
late a unilateral radiated incident ﬁeld, and 2) obviates multiple diﬀraction between the material
boundaries of the radiator (of which abstraction is made in this method) and those of the scatterer.

full line curve stems from the exact theory. The other three curves stem from the various aperture
method descriptions of the action of the antenna. The dotted curve results from the aperture
method relying on the synthesized sources for unilateral radiation.

Abstract – In a previous paper we have shown localized (non-evanescent) solutions to

Maxwell equations to exist, which propagate without distortion with Superluminal speed

along normal-sized waveguides, and consist in trains of “X-shaped” beams. Those solu-

tions possessed therefore inﬁnite energy. In this note we show how to obtain, by contrast,

ﬁnite-energy solutions, with the same localization and Superluminality properties.

1. – Introduction: Localized solutions to the wave equation

Already in 1915 Bateman[1] showed that Maxwell equations admit (besides of the

ordinary solutions, endowed in vacuum with speed c) of wavelet-type solutions, endowed in

vacuum with group-velocities 0

v

c. But Bateman’s work went practically unnoticed.

Only few authors, as Barut et al.[2], followed such a research line; incidentally, Barut et al.

constructed even a wavelet-type solution travelling with Superluminal group-velocity[3]

≤

≤

v > c.

In more recent times, however, many authors discussed the fact that all (homoge-

neous) wave equations admit solutions with 0 < v <

: see, e.g., refs.[4]. Most of those

authors conﬁned themselves to investigate (sub- or Super-luminal) localized non-dispersive

∞

solutions in vacuum: namely, those solutions that were called “undistorted progressive

waves” by Courant & Hilbert. Among localized solutions, the most interesting appeared

to be the so-called “X-shaped” waves, which —predicted to exist even by Special Relativ-

ity in its extended version[5]— had been mathematically constructed by Lu & Greenleaf[6]

for acoustic waves, and by Ziolkowski et al.[6], and later Recami[6], for electromagnetism.

Let us recall that such “X-shaped” localized solutions are Superluminal (i.e., travel with

v > c in the vacuum) in the electromagnetic case; and are “super-sonic” (i.e., travel with a

speed larger than the sound-speed in the medium) in the acoustic case. The ﬁrst authors

to produce X-shaped waves experimentally were Lu & Greenleaf[7] for acoustics, Saari et

al.[7] for optics, and Mugnai et al. for microwaves[7].

In a recent paper of ours, appeared in this journal[8], we showed that solutions to the

Maxwell equations exist, that displace themselves with Superluminal speed even along a

normal waveguide: where one ordinarily expects to meet propagating, subluminal modes

only. Actually, a segment of “undersized” waveguide constitutes an evanescence region[9],

and evanescent waves are known to travel Superluminally[5,9-11]; however, it was rather

unexpected that (localized) waves could propagate Superluminally down a normal-sized

waveguide. In fact, the dispersion relation in undersized guides is ω2/c2
dω/dβ yields a v > c group-velocity[12]; by contrast, in

Instead, in our paper[8] we have shown that localized solutions

to Maxwell equations do exist, propagating with v > c even in normal waveguides; but
their group-velocity v cannot be given#1 by the approximate formula v
us recall that the group-velocity is well deﬁned only when the pulse has a clear bump in

dω/dβ.

[Let

when ω as a function of β is also clearly bumped)].

2. – The inﬁnite-energy solutions

Namely, in ref.[8] we construced localized solutions to the Maxwell equations (which

propagate undistorted, with Superluminal speed along a cylindrical waveguide located

along the z-direction) for the TM (transverse magnetic) case and for a dispersion-free

medium. The case with dispersion has been treated elsewhere[13], as well as the case of a

co-axial cable[14]. Here, let us call attention to two points, which received just a mention

in ref.[8], with regard to eq.(9) and Fig.2 therein:

(i) those solutions consist in trains of

pulses (similar to the one depicted in Fig.2 of ref.[1]); (ii) each of such pulses is X-shaped:

See our Fig.1 below. Let us notice, incidentally, that we are referring ourselves to the

electromagnetic case, but the same would hold for all situations in which a fundamental

role is played by the wave equation (as in acoustics, geophysics, gravitational wave physics,

For intance, in the case of axial symmetry, let us consider a metallic waveguide with

etc.).

radius[8]

Let us also put ρ

(x, y), and ρ =

and the bondary condition Ψ(ρ = r, z; t) = 0. In

the previous paper[8] we constructed the following solution,

where Ψ represents the longitudinal component of the electric ﬁeld, Ez, while N is an
integer, the quantities λn are the roots of the Bessel function, Kn = λn/R, ωn = Kn c/ sin θ
and V = c/ cos θ. These solutions are therefore Fourier-Bessel–type sums over diﬀerent

propagating modes with angular frequencies ωn. One can moreover notice that, in eq.(1),
quantity θ is an arbitrary angle: by varying it, one obtains diﬀerent train speeds and

diﬀerent distance between the pulses. Actually, our solutions propagate rigidly down

the guide with (Superluminal) speed V = c/cos θ.

In Fig.1 we depict one of the trains

of X-shaped waves, obtained by numerical evaluation of eq.(1) for a waveguide radius

R = 5 cm, with θ = π/3 (and, therefore, group-velocity V = 2 c).

It is interesting to mention also that the integer N determines the space-time width of

the pulses: the higher N is, the smaller the pulse “spatio-temporal” width will be. Let

us emphasize that each eq.(1) represents a multimodal (but localized) propagation, as if

the geometric dispersion compensated for the multimodal dispersion.

We mentioned that Ψ represents the electric ﬁeld component Ez. Let us add that, by
following the procedure adopted by us in ref.[8], the other eletromagnetic ﬁeld components

in the considered TM case result to be

Equation (1) allows for a physical interpretation, which suggests a very simple way

to get it. Each pulse train is a sum of the ﬁrst N modes of our expansion (and for each

N we get a diﬀerent train, at our choice), whose frequencies have been suitably chosen as

corresponding to the intersections of the modal curves (i.e., the various branches of the

dispersion-relation) with the single straight line ω = V β whose slope depends on θ only:

see Fig.2.

In such a case, all the modes correspond to the same (Superluminal) phase-

velocity Vph, it being independent of the mode index n; but, when the phase-velocity is

4

independent of the frequency, it becomes the group-velocity, which is the velocity “tout

court” of the considered pulse. Let us repeat once more that we thus got (non-evanescent)

solutions to the Maxwell equations, which are waves propagating undistorted along normal

waveguides with Superluminal speed, even if in normal-sized waveguides the dispersion

relation for each mode, i.e. for each term of our Fourier-Bessel expansion, is the ordinary
β2 = +K 2). Let us repeat that, in fact, that the global
“subluminal” one, ω2/c2
velocity v (or group-velocity vg
v) of the pulses corresponding to eq.(1) is not to be
evaluated by the ordinary formula vg
This is at variance with the common situation in optical and microwave communications,

dω/dβ, valid for quasi-monochromatic signals).

≡

−

≃

when the signal is usually superimposed to a carrier wave whose frequency is generally

much higher than the signal bandwidth. In that case the standard formula for vg yields
the correct velocity to deal with (e.g., when propagation delays are studied). Our case, on

the contrary, is much more reminiscent of a baseband modulated signal, as those studied

in ultrasonics: the very concept of a carrier becomes meaningless here, as the elementary

“harmonic” components have widely diﬀerent frequencies.

The fact that our Superluminal solutions travel rigidly, down the waveguide, is at variance

also with what happens for truncated (Superluminal) solutions[15,7], which travel almost

rigidly only along their ﬁnite “ﬁeld depth” and then abruptly decay.

It may be ﬁnally underlined that the coeﬃcients in eq.(1) can be varied so to keep

the pulse spectrum inside the desired frequency range. This point will be discussed again

soon.

3. – The ﬁnite-energy solutions

In this note, we have called attention to the fact that solutions (1) are inﬁnite trains

of pulses, with inﬁnity energy. This is not a real problem (plane-waves too have inﬁnite

energy), provided that we are able to truncate them in space and time withount destroying

their good properties. We shall go on following the previous assumptions: what we are

going to do holds, however, for both the TM and the TE case. Let us anticipate that,

in order to get ﬁnite total-energy solutions, we shall have to replace each characteristic

frequency ωn [cf. eq.(1), or Fig.2] by a small frequency band ∆ω centered at ωn, always
choosing the same ∆ω independently of n.
In fact, since all the modes entering the

5

V = c/ cos θ, each small
Fourier-type expansion (1) possess the same phase-velocity Vph
bandwidth packet associated with ωn will possess the same group-velocity vg = c2/Vph,
so that we shall have as a result a wave whose envelope travels with the subluminal

≡

group-velocity vg. However, inside that subluminal envelope, one or more pulses will be
travelling with the dual (Superluminal ) speed V = c2/vg. Such well-localized peaks will
have nothing to do with the ordinary (sinusoidal) carrier-wave, and will be regarded as

constituting the relevant wave. When integrating each term of expansion (1) over its

corresponding frequency-band, one may choose, e.g., Gaussiam spectra.

Before going on, let us mention that previous work related to FTESs can be found

—as far as we know— only in refs.[16,14,17].

More formally, let us consider our ordinary solutions for a metallic waveguide, written in

the form

ψn(ρ, z; t) = An Rn(ρ) cos [β(ω) z

ωt] ,

where coeﬃcients An and functions Rn are given by the coeﬃcients and the (transverse)
functions entering eq.(1); namely:

Gaussian function Wn for each ωn-value. Such weights Wn are well localized around the
corresponding ωn, so that one can expand (for each value of n, in the above sum) the
function β(ω) in the neighbourhood of the corresponding ωn-value as follows:

4. – Conclusions

In conclusion, looking for ﬁnite total-energy solutions, we have found a Gaussian

envelope that travels with a subluminal velocity v = c cos θ. However, inside it, we have
got a train of pulses travelling Superluminally (with V = c2/v = c/ cos θ). And we can
control the number of pulses inside the envelope just by varying the value of q.

n/c2

n = ω2

β2 are constant for each mode, and vg

We have actually shown that, if we choose the ωn-values as in Fig.2, all the small-
bandwith packets centered in the ωn’s will have the same phase-velocity V > c and
therefore the same group-velocity vg < c [since for metallic waveguides the quantities

This means that the envelope of solution (5)-(7) moves with slower-than-light speed; the
envelope length† ∆ℓ depending on the chosen ∆ω, and being therefore proportional to
qvg. However, inside such an envelope, one has a train of (X-shaped) pulses —having
nothing to do with the ordinary carrier wave, ‡— travelling with the Superluminal speed

An interesting point is that we can choose the envelope length so that it contains

only one (X-shaped wave) peak. Even if the (global) speed of the envelope is subluminal

in the ﬁnite-energy case, while Superluminal speeds are met only locally (internally),

peak inside the envelope, the envelope length is to be chosen smaller than the distance

between two successive peaks of the (inﬁnite total energy) train (1). The amplitude of

such a single X-shaped pulse (which remains conﬁned inside the envelope boundary) ﬁrst

increases, and afterwards decreases, while travelling; till when it practically disappears.

While the considered pulse tends to vanish on the right (i.e., under the right tail of the

envelope), a second pulse starts to be created on the left; and so on [from eq.(7) it is clear,

in fact, that our ﬁnite-energy solutions are nothing but an (inﬁnite-energy) solution of

the type in eq.(1), multiplied by a Gaussian function]. We illustrate such a behaviour

in Figs.3, namely, in the set of eight ﬁgures from Fig.3a to Fig.3h. We have depicted a

similar behaviour in the last set of ﬁgures of ref.[13], when studying the case of a co-axial

guide.

Let us ﬁnally remark that similar considerations could be extended to all the situ-

ations where a waveguide supports several modes. Tests at microwave frequencies, for

instance, should be rather easy to perform; by contrast, experiments in the optical do-

main are made diﬃcult, at present, by the limited extension of the spectral windows

corresponding to not too large attenuations: we shall discuss this point elsewhere.

is rather interesting that our FTESs are related to the X-shaped waves, since in eq.(7) the

function Ψ(ρ, z
